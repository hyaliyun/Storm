诉讼时效的概念与重要性 诉讼时效（Statute of Limitations）是制定在法律上的一种时间限制，其主要目的是确保法律争议能在合理的时间范围内得到解决。过长的时间可能会给被告带来不公正的环境，因为随着时间的推移，证据可能会丢失，记忆也可能会模糊。在康州，这一原则体现在诸多领域中，包括虚假陈述的案件。 # 虚假陈述的定义与举例 在康州，虚假陈述是指一方在交易或合同准备过程中故意或由于粗心大意而提供错误信息，导致另一方遭受损失。举例来说，如果一家公司在出售期间对其财务状况作出虚假陈述，那么买家可以基于虚假陈述对卖家提起诉讼。 # 虚假陈述的诉讼时效规定 康州对虚假陈述诉讼的时效有具体规定。根据康州法律，虚假陈述案件的诉讼时效一般为两到三年，具体取决于案件的具体情况。理解和遵守这些规定对于保护您的权益至关重要。 # 时效期限的计算方法 诉讼时效的开始计算通常是在受害方发现或应当发现虚假陈述之日。然而，在某些情境下，如果被告采取行动企图隐藏事实，可以延长或中断时效期限的计算。这意味着在某些案件中，原告可能有更多时间提起诉讼。 # 如何防止虚假陈述引发的法律纠纷 预防虚假陈述的最佳策略之一是确保所有交易和合同文档都经过彻底的审查，并保留所有相关通信记录。在必要时，可以寻求专业法律顾问的帮助，确保您的权益得到保护。 # 虚假陈述诉讼时效期限到期后的后果 一旦诉讼时效期限过期，原告就丧失了通过司法途径追究被告责任的权利。这意味着法院将不会接受该案件的起诉，原告将无法得到赔偿。 # 实际案例与解决方案分析 通过分析康州的虚假陈述案例，我们可以看到不同案件中诉讼时效的应用和处理方式。这些案例教育我们识别潜在的法律风险，并采取适当措施以减少发生虚假陈述的可能。 # 未来发展趋势与建议 随着技术的发展和市场环境的变化，预计会对虚假陈述及其诉讼时效规定产生影响。建议立法机构不断审查和更新相关法律，同时企业和个人应增强自身法律意识，以适应这些变化并避免潜在的法律纠纷。 通过以上讨论，我们可以看到虚假陈述及其诉讼时效在康州法律中的重要地位。正确理解和应用这些原则对于保护个人和企业的权益至关重要。"},{"prompt":"纷的快速解决。 假设你是美国康州的法律教授，请使用框架思维系统思维列举主题： 主题（虚假陈述 诉讼时效）， 要求：把所有的大点全部都详尽列举完。每个大点也要详尽的包含子的点。 大点和子点均按照重要性顺序排列。重要的放在前面","completion":"在康州关于虚假陈述诉讼时效的法律框架下，可以通过以下体系化的思维方式来归类和分析相关主题： #

Введение в методики решения проблем: ТРИЗ и FMEA A. Значение систематических подходов к решению проблем В современном мире, полном сложных технических и производственных вызовов, способность эффективно решать проблемы становится критически важным навыком для инженеров, разработчиков и менеджеров. Растущая сложность технологий и процессов требует применения проверенных, научных подходов к идентификации, анализу и решению проблем. Систематические методики решения проблем, такие как ТРИЗ (Теория Решения Изобретательских Задач) и FMEA (Анализ Типов и Последствий Отказов), предоставляют структурированный фреймворк, который помогает минимизировать человеческие ошибки, сократить время на решение проблем и повысить качество и надежность продукции. B. Краткий обзор методик решения проблем: ТРИЗ и FMEA 1. **ТРИЗ** - это методология, разработанная для систематизации процесса изобретательства. Она основана на идее, что изобретательские проблемы могут быть решены путем анализа существующих решений в различных областях и применения абстрактных принципов для нахождения новых решений. ТРИЗ включает в себя ряд инструментов, таких как анализ функциональности, матрица противоречий, алгоритм решения изобретательских задач (АРИЗ), которые помогают систематически подходить к решению проблем. 2. **FMEA** - это аналитическая методология, цель которой - идентифицировать и оценить каждый потенциальный способ, которым может произойти отказ компонента или системы. Это предполагает оценку серьезности последствий каждого возможного отказа, его вероятности и возможности его обнаружения. FMEA применяется для повышения надежности продуктов и процессов путем систематического выявления и предотвращения потенциальных проблем еще на этапе разработки. Эти систематические подходы к решению проблем позволяют сокращать затраты, уменьшать риски, улучшать качество и инновационные характеристики продукции или процессов. Введение вказанные методики дает возможность участникам лекции понять их значение, основные принципы и области применения, а также подготавливает основу для дальнейшего более глубокого изучения каждой из методик."},{"prompt":"давай второй пункт","completion":"# II. ТРИЗ (Теория Решения Изобретательских Задач) A. История возникновения и развития ТРИЗ ТРИЗ была разработана советским ученым и инженером Генрихом Сауловичем Альтшуллером и его коллегами в середине 20-го века. Анализируя большое количество патентов, Альтшуллер обнаружил закономерности в процессе изобретения, которые легли в основу ТРИЗ. Он показал, что процесс изобретательства может быть систематизирован и предсказуем, а не случаен и хаотичен. Со временем ТРИЗ превратилась в международно признанный метод, используемый для решения инженерных и бизнес-задач. B. Основные положения и принципы ТРИЗ 1. **Законы развития системы**: ТРИЗ идентифицирует общие законы развития технических систем, что позволяет предвидеть будущее развитие технологий. 2. **Противоречия как основа для изобретений**: Все изобретения решают противоречия между существующими параметрами или функциями. Различают технические и физические противоречия. 3. **Алгоритм решения изобретательских задач (АРИЗ)**: Структурированный подход к решению сложных проблем, который включает анализ проблемы, формулировку идеального конечного результата и поиск решений с помощью ТРИЗ инструментов. C. Инструменты ТРИЗ 1. **40 принципов преодоления технических противоречий**: Ключевые принципы, которые можно применять для нахождения решения типовых технических противоречий. 2. **Матрица противоречий**: Инструмент, позволяющий определить подходящие принципы для решения конкретного технического противоречия на основе анализа характеристик проблемы. 3. **Стандарты решения изобретательских задач**: Набор рекомендаций и методик, основанных на истории успешных изобретений, который помогает решать задачи в различных областях. 4. **Патентный анализ**: Методология анализа патентных баз данных с целью выявления потенциальных возможностей для изобретения и избежания нарушения чужих патентных прав. D. Примеры применения ТРИЗ на практике - Применение ТРИЗ в автомобильной промышленности для улучшения дизайна и функциональности автомобилей. - Использование ТРИЗ в нефтегазовой отрасли для оптимизации процессов добычи и переработки. - Разработка новых продуктов в электронике и бытовой технике с использованием принципов ТРИЗ для удовлетворения потребительских потребностей. ТРИЗ предоставляет мощную базу для инновационного процесса решения проблем, позволяя разработчикам и инженерам выходить за рамки традиционного мышления и находить принципиально новые решения."},{"prompt":"давай теперь третий","completion":"# III. FMEA (Анализ Типов и Последствий Отказов) A. История возникновения и развития FMEA Анализ типов и последствий отказов (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, FMEA) был впервые разработан в 1940-х годах для военной промышленности США, главным образом в авиационной и космической отраслях, чтобы уменьшить вероятность отказов в критически важном оборудовании. С тех пор FMEA эволюционировал и нашел широкое применение в различных секторах промышленности, включая автомобильную промышленность, медицинское оборудование, производство и даже услуги, как метод снижения рисков и повышения надежности продукции. B. Основные положения и принципы FMEA 1. **Цели и задачи FMEA**: Основная цель FMEA - это идентификация всех возможных режимов отказа продукта или процесса, анализ их последствий и разработка мероприятий по снижению риска этих отказов. 2. **Различия между DFMEA и PFMEA**: DFMEA (Design FMEA) фокусируется на отказах, связанных с дизайном продукта, тогда как PFMEA (Process FMEA) анализирует отказы, возникающие на этапе производственного процесса. C. Этапы проведения FMEA 1. **Определение функций, состояний неработоспособности и потенциальных отказов**: Каждый компонент или этап процесса анализируется на предмет определения его функций, потенциальных способов отказа и последствий этих отказов. 2. **Оценка серьезности, вероятности и обнаружимости каждого потенциального отказа**: Для каждого режима отказа оценивается серьезность последствий, вероятность возникновения и возможность его обнаружения до того, как отказ приведет к серьезным последствиям. 3. **Вычисление приоритетного числа риска (RPN)**: RPN - это числовое значение, получаемое путем умножения оценок серьезности, вероятности и обнаружимости. Это позволяет приоритизировать режимы отказа для корректирующих действий. 4. **Разработка мер по снижению риска**: На основе полученных RPN разрабатываются меры по уменьшению вероятности отказов или минимизации их последствий. D. Инструменты и примеры шаблонов для FMEA FMEA требует документирования анализа в специальных формах или программном обеспечении, включающем все этапы анализа, оценки и рекомендации. Обычно это таблицы с колонками для каждого из анализируемых параметров (функция, режим отказа, последствия отказа, RPN и предложенные действия). E. Кейс-стади и примеры применения FMEA на практике - В автомобильной промышленности FMEA используется для выявления потенциальных отказов в новых моделях автомобилей до начала их массового производства. - В медицинской индустрии FMEA применяется для анализа медицинских устройств или процессов лечения с целью предотвращения ошибок, которые могут привести к угрозе для жизни пациентов. - В производстве FMEA помогает минимизировать простои из-за отказов оборудования, повышая таким образом эффективность и качество продукции. FMEA служит мощным инструментом для проактивного управления рисками, позволяя организациям предотвратить проблемы до их возникновения и обеспечить высокую надежность продуктов и процессов."},{"prompt":"давай четвертый","completion":"# IV. Сравнение и контраст ТРИЗ и FMEA A. Отличия в подходах ТРИЗ и FMEA представляют собой два различных подхода к решению проблем, каждый из которых имеет свои уникальные особенности и преимущества. ТРИЗ сосредотачивается на идентификации и решении изобретательских проблем путем устранения противоречий, тогда как FMEA направлен на проактивное выявление потенциальных отказов и анализ их последствий с целью предупреждения. 1. **ТРИЗ:** - Основана на принципах решения изобретательских задач. - Фокусируется на использовании абстрактных принципов и патентном анализе для нахождения новаторских решений. - Подходит для решения сложных технических проблем путем устранения противоречий. 2. **FMEA:** - Ориентирована на анализ и минимизацию рисков потенциальных отказов. - Применяет методику оценки последствий, вероятности и обнаружимости отказа. - Целенаправленно используется для улучшения надежности и безопасности продуктов и процессов. B. Области применения - **ТРИЗ** обычно применяется в ситуациях, требующих изобретательского подхода к решению технических проблем, разработке новых продуктов или улучшению существующих без прямого прототипирования. - **FMEA** чаще используется на этапах проектирования и производства для идентификации возможных проблем до начала массового производства, а также в процессах, где важно уменьшить риск отказов и последствий для безопасности и надежности. C. Как ТРИЗ и FMEA дополняют друг друга Хотя ТРИЗ и FMEA имеют различные цели и подходы, они могут эффективно дополнять друг друга при комплексном подходе к улучшению продуктов и процессов. ТРИЗ может помочь в генерации инновационных решений на этапе дизайна, тогда как FMEA может обеспечить последующую проверку этих решений на предмет потенциальных отказов и рисков. - Используя **ТРИЗ** для стимулирования инновационного мышления и разработки, компании могут идентифицировать новаторские способы решения проблем. - Применяя **FMEA** для анализа разработанных решений, можно выявить возможные риски и отграничить их, еще до начала производства или внедрения. Таким образом, объединение ТРИЗ и FMEA позволяет сочетать творческий подход к инновациям с внимательным учетом безопасности и надежности, обеспечивая тем самым более сбалансированную разработку продукта."},{"prompt":"بين العامية والفصحى وجود لغة عليا للفكر والأدب مع لهجات محلية للتعامل، ظاهرة طبيعية عرفتها العربية منذ عصرها الجاهلي القديم، وعرفتها سائر اللغات الحية، وعرفتها اللغة العربية من قديمها البعيد حين كانت في أول أمرها بشبه الجزيرة العربية لم تخرج منها وظلت اللهجات المحلية ) لهجات القبائل العربية كتميم وأسد وهذيل وغيرها ) اللغة العربية الفصحى اللغة العالية المشتركة جنبا إلى جنب ولم تجر هذه اللهجات على الفصحى التي بقيت لغة الأمة دينا ودولة وأساس وحدتها الروحية تعيش مع والوجدانية، واللغة العليا للتعليم والتأليف والثقافة والفنون والحضارة. ومهما يكن من تفاوت بين هذه اللهجات المحلية، والعربية الفصحى فإنها لم تخرج عن كونها لهجات شعبية للعربية، تتصل دائما وأبدا بالعربية الفصحى العليا في القرآن الكريم الذي حفظ طبيعتها اللغوية، وفي الخطب الدينية والسياسية والمناسبات والأعياد الدينية، وفي كتابات الأدباء والشعراء. وتأسيسا على ذلك فإننا حين نقول اللهجة المصرية، أو العامية المصرية، أو السورية، أو العراقية، أو السودانية، أو المغربية، فليست هذه العاميات إلا اللغة العربية على ألسنة شعوب هذه الدول، ومهما يكن من بقايا اللغة المصرية القديمة في اللهجة المصرية العربية، أو بقايا اللغة البربرية في لهجات المغرب العربي، أو بقايا اللغة الآرامية في اللهجة السورية وبلاد الشام فإن هذه البقايا لا ينفي انتماء هذه اللهجات إلى اللغة العربية، والثابت تاريخيا أن اللهجات العربية القديمة والمعاصرة) لم تقف حاجزا أمام الشعوب العربية في فهم اللغة العربية الفصحى لا في كتابهم المستويات اللغوية المستويات اللغوية أو ما يعرف باسم الازدواج اللغوي\\" يقصدون به وجود لوتين فأكثر من الأداء اللغوي (الكلام) أحدهما فصيح والآخر دونه في الفصاحة . ومن خلال البحث العلمي يمكننا أن نقرر أن هناك في البيئة العربية الواحدة مستويات لغوية ذات سمات وخواص مختلفة. أهم هذه المستويات وأقربها إلى الواقع وأكثرها شمولا واتساعا ثلاث هي: 1- العامية. ٢- الفصحى المعاصرة. فصحى التراث. أولا : العامية هي : لغة الحديث اليومي الدارج ولغة الحياة العامة بكل ما فيها من أوجه النشاط الإنساني على مستوى الجماهير العريضة، ولها صورة لغوية معروفة مستقرة في كل بلد عربي. ثانيا : الفصحى المعاصرة هي : صيغة لغوية تستخدم في الكتابة في الأغلب الأعم، فهي لغة التأليف في شتى مناحيه وفنونه. وهي بالإضافة إلى ذلك لها وجود من نوع ما في الكلام المنطوق، كما يبدو مثلا في المحاضرات الجامعية الجيدة، والخطب السياسية الجادة وفي الندوات العلمية ذات المستوى اللاتي، وفي نشرات الأخبار في الإدانة بوسيلتيها الراديو والتليفزيون\\". وهذه الفصحى تنتظم -

كما نعهدها ونستخدمها الآن - ليست مجهولة تمام الجهل المتعلمين، وإن شق عليهم التحدث بها أو استخدامها في التعبير عن ذوات أنفسهم، وهذه هي المشكلة الحقيقية التي تقابل بعض المتعلمين في المراحل التعليمية، ويمكن علاجها من خلال الآتي : أولا : استغلال ما لديهم من معرفة بعناصر الفصحى المعاصرة، تلك المعرفة التي حصلوا عليها بطريق الاستماع إلى الأحاديث الجيدة من الإذاعة وغيرها من وسائل الإعلام والتثقيف. ثانيا : \\"وهو الأهم سبيلنا إلى استغلال هذه العناصر الفصيحة وتنميتها هو اتخاذنا العامية في الوطن العربي المعين مدخلا إلى الفصحى ومعبرا إليها. وربما يسهل علينا ذلك ما نلمسه من تداخل بين الفصحى المعاصرة وبعض عناصر العامية وبخاصة فيما يتعلق بالثروة اللفظية. إننا -

اللهجات لم تكن سائدة عند العرب جميعا، بل كانت لهجات خاصة ببعض القبائل العربية، ولم تشتهر في العربية الفصحى، بل وصف بعضها بأنه من اللهجات المذمومة التي لا يؤخذ به في فصيح الكلام، ومن هذه اللغات ما يأتي : 1 - العنعنة وهي : إبدال الهمزة المفتوحة عينا، إذا وقعت في أول الكلمة، فيقولون في أنك: \\"عنك\\"، ويقولون في أسلم: \\"عسلم\\". وبعض علماء اللغة يخصون العنعنة بإبدال الهمزة المفتوحة من \\"أن\\" فقط، ومنه قولهم: أشهد عنك رسول الله، بدلا من : أنك، وقال بعضهم : سمعت عن فلانا قال كذا، يريدون : أن فلانا قال كذا. وقد نطقت بهذه اللهجة قبائل تميم، و قيس، وأسد ٣٠. ولا تزال هذه الظاهرة قائمة في بعض اللهجات الدراجة في صورتها المشار إليها سابقا، ففي مدن تهامة من المملكة العربية السعودية يقولون : \\"عالة\\" في \\"آلة\\" و\\"العمام\\" في \\"الإمام\\"، ومن ذلك في لهجات الصعيد في مصر اسعل وسعال بدلاً من (اسأل وسؤال) و(لع) بدلاً من (لأ) (۳، كما يوجد في لهجة شمال المغرب أيضاً، فهم يقولون : تتبع في تخبأ، وإنشاع الله في إن شاء الله ٣٢. وقديما في عامية أهل صقلية يقولون للفرس يقارب حمرته السواد : أصدع، في أصدأ مأخوذ من صدأ الحديد، ويقولون فقعت عين الرجل، وهو مفقوع العين في فقأت عينه، وهو مفقوء العين ٣٣ ولم تنفرد العربية دون أخواتها الساميات بهذه الظاهرة، فهو مستعمل في اللغة الحبشية، يقولون مثلاً : عربع في أربع . ٢ - الوتم قال السيوطى في تعريفه : الوتم في لغة اليمن تجعل السين تاء، كالنات في الناس ٣٥٠، أي يقلبون السين تاء، فيقولون: النات بدلا من الناس، وعلى هذه اللهجة جاء قول الشاعر يهجو بني عمرو بن يربوع : ۳۱ يا قبح الله بنى السعلاة ليسوا بأخيار ولا أكيات عمرو بن يربوع شرار النات يريد: \\"الناس\\" و\\"أكياس\\" فجعل السين تاء ٣٦ وقد نسبت هذه اللهجة إلى أهل اليمن فيما سبق، ونص بعض علماء اللغة ٣٧ على أنها لهجة في حمير من قبائل اليمن، وذكر ابن منظور في ذلك ما نصه : \\"وإذا قال الرجل العدوه لا بأس عليك فقد أمنه، لأنه نفى البأس عنه، وهي في لغة حمير ليات، أي لا بأس عليك ٣٨. وقد قرئ: قل أعوذ برب الناس\\" برب النات ، وذكر أبو عمرو أنها لهجة لقضاعة. - الفحفحة المشهور عند العلماء أن الحاء تبدل عينا في لهجة هذيل، وأن هذه الظاهرة اللغوية كانت شائعة عندهم، وقد اتفقوا على تسميتها \\"الفحفحة\\"، وقالوا في تعريفها هي قلب الحاء عينا مطلقا ، فيقولون في مثل : حلت الحياة لكل حي : علت المياة لكل عي، ويقولون : \\"اللهم الأعمر أحسن من اللعم الأبيض\\" يريدون : \\"اللحم الأحمر أحسن من اللحم الأبيض ٤٢\\"، وعلى لهجتهم قرأ عبد الله بن مسعود رضي الله عنه : \\"على حين في قوله تعالى : \\"حتى حين ١٣ والمشهور فيها إبدال الحاء عينا من كلمة \\"حتى\\" فقط، أي أنها مقصورة في كلامهم على الحاء من حتى وليست في كل حاء. ٤ - الاستنطاء هو: \\"إبدال العين الساكنة نونا إذا وقعت قبل الطاء ، وقد ذكرت لنا كتب التراث العربي اللغوي أن حرف العين إذا وقع ساكنا قبل الطاء تبدل نونا في لهجة سعد بن عامر، وهذيل، والأزد، وقيس، وأن هذا الإبدال اللغوي يمثل ظاهرة الهجية عامة في لسان هذه القبائل تسمى \\"الاستنطاء \\". وبهذه اللهجة قرأ الحسن، وطلحة، وغيرهما : \\"إنا أنطيناك الكوثر\\" في قوله تعالى : \\"إنا أعطيناك الكوثر\\"، وهي قراءة مروية عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ومنه قوله صلى الله عليه وسلم في حديث الدعاء : لا مانع لما أنطيت، ولا منطي لما منعت\\"، وهي لغة أهل اليمن في أعطى ، أي : لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ومنه أيضا حديث النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم : \\"اليد المنطية خير من اليد السفلى ٤٨ أي : اليد المعطية وما زالت هذه اللهجة شائعة في دول الخليج العربي، يقولون : أنطيتك كذا يريدون : أعطيتك كذا، ولا زال العراقيون حتى الآن يستعملون اللفظة على هذا النحو، حين يتخاطبون فيما بينهم، فيقول أحدهم حين يطلب التليفون مثلا : \\"أنطيني التليفون\\" أي : أعطيني التليفون. وهي أيضا شائعة في لهجة الأعراب بصحاري مصر\\". ه . الكشكشة هذه الظاهرة اللهجية على قسمين : الأول : إبدال كاف ضمير المؤنث شيئا، فبعض العرب يقولون في : رأيتك، وعليك : عليش، ورأيتش حرصا منهم على التفريق بين المؤنث والمذكر في حالة الوقف؛ لأن الكسرة الدالة على المؤنث قد تخفى في الوقف، فيلتبس المؤنث بالمذكر. والمتكلمون بهذه اللهجة منهم من يثبت الشين في حالة الوقف فقط، وهو المشهور عنهم، ومنهم من يثبتها في الوصل\\" أثناء الكلام\\" ومنه قول الشاعر : سوى أن عظم الساق منش دقيق فعيناش عيناها وجيدش جيدها * أي : فعيناك عيناها وجيدك جيدها سوى أن عظم الساق منك دقيق وروى بعضهم لأنه سمع امرأة أعرابية تقول الجاريتها : \\"ارجعي وراءش فإن مولاش يناديش\\" أي : ارجعي وراءك فان مولاك يناديك. الثاني : إلحاق الشين بكاف ضمير المؤنث، فمنهم من يقول: إنكش ورأيتكش، وأعطيتكش بدلا من اللغة الفصحى : إنك، ورأيتك، وأعطيتك وقد نطقت بهذه اللهجة عدة قبائل عربية، وهي : قبيلة ربيعة، وقبيلة مصر، وناس كثير من تميم، وبكر. ٦ - الكسكسة الكسكسة ظاهرة الهجية نسبت إلى بعض العرب، وهي مثل الكشكشة في المعنى، قصدوا منها التفريق بين المذكر والمؤنث في الوقف لئلا يلتبس المذكر بالمؤنث عند الوقف على الكاف، وهي : إبدال كاف ضمير المؤنث سينا، يقولون : أبوس، وأمس، بدلا من الفصحى : \\"أبوك، وأمك\\". وبعضهم يلحق سينا بعد كاف المؤنث ولا يبدلها منها، فيقول: أعطيتكس، وأكر متكس، وعليكس، بدلا من الفصحى: أعطيتك، وأكرمتك، وعليك. ومن كلامهم : \\"عرفتس لما أن نظرتس \\" أي : عرفتك لما أن نظرتك. وقد نطقت بهذه اللهجة عدة قبائل عربية، وهي : قبيلة بكر، وقبيلة أسد، وقبيلة ربيعة، وقبيلة مضر، ونسبها بعضهم إلى تميم، وهذيل \\" - الشنشنة إذ كما قد عرفنا أن الكشكشة والكسكسة تختصان بإبدال كاف ضمير المؤنث شيئا أو سينا، فإن الشنشنة لا تختص بذلك، إذ هي \\"جعل الكاف شيئا مطلقاً، سواء أكانت للمذكر أم للمؤنث. سمع من بعض أهل اليمن يوم عرفة يقولون ، \\"البيش اللهم لبيش أي لبيك اللهم لبيك، وهي لهجة نطق بها أهل اليمن\\"، وهي شائعة في عامة أهل حضرموت، ولا تزال هذه اللهجة تسمع في اللهجات اليمنية الحديثة، وفي بعض قرى محافظة الشرقية يبدلون الكاف في نحو : كلب، وكشك، وكمون شيئا، أو حرفا قريبا من الشير .. - الطمطمانية يذهب بعض اللغويين إلى أن الطمطمانية معناها العجمة، أو أن يكون الكلام مشبها لكلام العجم، وقد استعملت في كلام حمير تشبيها لها بكلام العجم لم فيها من الألفاظ التي لا يألفونها في اللغة العربية الفصحى والطمطمانية هي : إبدال لام التعريف ميما لهجة معروفة في اليمن، واشتهرت بها حمير، كما نسبت إلى قبيلة طيء، يقولون : \\"امبر، وامصيام، امسفر، أي البر والصيام والسفر بإبدال لام التعريف ميما، وكذلك قولهم : طاب امهواء، وصفا الجو، أي الهواء، والجو، وقد شرف النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم هذه اللهجة، حيث روي عنه أنه قال يخاطب بعض الحميريين : \\"ليس من امبر امصيام في امسفر .. أي ليس من البر الصيام في السفر. ولا زالت هذه اللهجة شائعة ومستعملة في تعريف الأسماء في بعض مناطق اليمن مثل : حاشد، وأرحب، وسحار من محافظة صعدة، ولكنهم ينطقونها بكسر الهمزة \\"إم\\". وهي أيضا مستعملة وشائعة في اللهجة المصرية في لفظ واحد، حيث ينطق بهذه اللهجة أغلب المصريين في لفظ البارحة فقط، يقولون : إمبارح يقصدون البارح أو البارحة (أمس)، وهو أقرب يوم مضى، وقد تنطق إنبارح .. - التلتلة سفرة راء جة في طق سر ن من المعروف في اللغة العربية الفصحى أن حروف المضارعة، والمجموعة في قولهم : \\"أنيت\\" تفتح في الفعل الثلاثي، تقول : أشرب، يشرب، تشرب، نشرب، ويضم في الفعل الرباعي، تقول : تحسن، تحسن، يُحسن، أحسن. هذه هي اللغة الفصحى المشهورة عند جمهور العرب، بيد أن قبيلة \\"بهراء تكسر حرف المضارعة خلافا للعرب، لا فرق عندها بين حرف وحرف من حروف المضارعة، ولا بين صيغة وصيغة أخرى من الأفعال، فتنطق الأفعال السابقة هكذا : إشرب شرب، تشرب، نشرب بكسر حرف المضارعة، وعلى هذا النمط جميع الأفعال. وهذه اللهجة نطقت بها بالإضافة إلى قبيلة بهراء قبيلة قضاعة، وتميم، وأسد، وقيس، واشتهرت هذه اللهجة في كثير من قبائل العرب حتى قيل : \\"هي لغة جميع العرب إلا أهل الحجاز \\". وهذه اللهجة شائعة بكثرة في اللهجة المصرية يقولون : نلعب، نجري، نسافر، تشرب، يمشي بكسر أول الفعل المضارع مفهوم اللغة المشتركة تقوم اللغة المشتركة على أساس التواصل والاختلاط التام بين أفراد الجماعة اللغوية الواحدة والتعاون فيما بينهم في شتى شؤون الحياة، ولا شك أن هذا الأمر يساعدهم على التخلص من لهجاتهم المحلية بسماتها اللغوية وصفاتها الخاصة، والبحث عن لغة مشتركة بينهم، تتميز بصفات لغوية عامة واحدة، وتتجرد من المزايا الإقليمية والقبلية، والتي يستطيع بها أصحاب اللهجات جميعا أن يتكلموا بها دون حرج أو مشقة، لأن خصائص تلك اللغة لم تجنح إلى التفريق المبني على العصبية للهجة معينة، ولذلك لا تجد الألسنة صعوبة في النطق بها ولا الأفواه مشقة على التعود عليها . هذا وقد دلت الملاحظة على أنه حين تقوى الصلة بين أفراد الجماعة اللغوية، وتسهل بينهم وسائل الاتصال والارتباط مادية كانت أو ثقافية تتكون لهم مع الزمن لغة مشتركة تقرب بينهم وتعينهم على تفاهم أسرع وأيسر، وتقضي لهم مصالحهم الدنيوية، ثم تصبح بعد ذلك وسيلة للمتعة حين تتخذ للتعبير عن أحاسيسهم وعواطفهم في كل نتاج أدبي جميل \\". وإذن فمفهوم اللغة المشتركة لا يعني مستوى رفيعا من التعبير الفني، ولكنه قدر في متناول أوساط الناس يتعامل مع قدراتهم الثقافية العامة، فهم يفهمونه وإن كان بعضهم لا يحسن استعماله في التعبير عن أفكاره، وقد يكون هذا المستوى مكتوبا يقرؤونه، وقد يكون منطوقا يسمعونه في مجال من المجالات الجادة .. وبناء عليه فقد قالوا في تعريف اللغة المشتركة : هي الصورة اللغوية المثالية التي تفرض نفسها على جميع الأفراد في مجموعة واحدة . والصفة الأساسية في اللغة المشتركة أنها لا تنتمي صفاتها أو عناصرها إلى لهجة محلية بعينها، بمعنى أن الخطيب أو الشاعر أو المتكلم باللغة المشتركة لا يتكلم للهجته المحلية ولا يلحظ المستمع ذلك في كلامه، ومعنى هذا أن اللغة المشتركة ليست لغة قبيلة بعينها، أو بعبارة أخرى أن اللغة المشتركة لا تتضمن شيء من خصائص اللهجات المحلية، فهي لغة منسجمة موحدة لا يمكن أن تنتمي إلى بيئة لغوية خاصة، فمثلا اللغة العربية الفصحى لا تنتمي إلى بيئة لغوية خاصة من بيئات الجزيرة العربية، فلا يحق لنا أن نقول مثلا : إن اللغة العربية الفصحى (اللغة المشتركة هي لغة قريش أو لغة تميم أو غيرها من القبائل العربية، بل هي مريح مأخوذ من كل هذه اللغات، تكونت له شخصيته وأصبح مستقلا عن اللهجات. ولكن يمكن القول بأن لهجة قريش أسهمت بعناصر كثيرة في تكوين اللغة العربية الفصحى (اللغة المشتركة فلا مبالغة إذن في إطلاق لهجة قريش على اللغة العربية الفصحى، إذ اللغات المشتركة تقوم دائما على أساس لغة موجودة بالفعل حيث تتخذ هذه اللغة الموجودة لغة مشتركة من جانب أفراد وجماعات، تختلف لديهم صور الكلام على حد قول فندريس \\". أي أنها لغة وسطي موجودة بين لهجات أولئك الذين يتكلمون بها، وإذا أتيح للغة المشتركة أن تنتشر في قطر من الأقطار، أو في دولة من الدول أخذت العناصر المشتركة في تكونها في الازدياد . وغالبا ما تكون اللغة المشتركة في أول الأمر لهجة محلية تحظى بقدر من التعظيم والتمجيد، ويعترف بها لغة رسمية للدولة لسبب من الأسباب مثل : أن تكون لهجة منطقة من البلد اتخذت مقرا للحكم مثل : اللغة الفرنسية في الأصل لهجة باريسية تغلبت على اللهجات المحلية الأخرى خرجت من العاصمة، ومن طبقة اجتماعية بعينها من طبقات العاصمة، وهي البرجوازية التي استقرت في القرن السابع عشر، وسلم بها القصر، ثم الأقاليم والكتاب الكبار باستعمالهم إياها، وزودوها بالقدرة على فرض نفسها نهائيا، وعلى استمرارها، لذلك لا نكاد نحس فيها أثرا للهجات \\". وكذلك كانت اللغة العربية الفصحى فقد توفرت عوامل عديدة جعلت لهجة مكة (قريش) لغة مشتركة للعرب جميعا، حيث كان الناس يفدون إلى مكة لأجل الحج والتجارة، ولم تكن مكة سوقا للتجارة وموضعا للعبادة فحسب بل كانت أيضا ركزا عظيما للأدب والخطابة، وكان الشعراء والخطباء من كل القبائل والأماكن يأتون إلى مكة يعرضون أشعارهم وخطبهم على الناس بتلك اللغة المشتركة التي يجتمعون على فهمها على الرغم من اختلاف لهجاتهم. واللغة المشتركة تحظى بمكانة عظيمة عند أصحابها يدل على ذلك أنها اللغة التي يعلمونها لمن يريد أن يتعلمها من غير المتكلمين بها، وهي اللغة التي يعدونها مماثلة اللغات الأخرى ومعبرة عن شخصيتهم القومية، كما أنها تقوم بوظائف مهمة متصلة بالشئون العامة لأفراد الشعب، فهي لغة الدولة الرسمية بكل مؤسساتها وهيئاتها المختلفة، وهي أيضا لغة التعليم بكل مراحله ومستوياته، وهي كذلك لغة العلم\\". ولا يغيب عنا أيضا أن اللغة المشتركة قد تتولد عن تغلب إحدى اللغات على لغات أخرى، كما حدث للغة العربية بعد الإسلام، حيث دخلت أماكن كثيرة متعددة اللغات، واستطاعت اللغة العربية في نهاية الأمر أن تقضي على هذه اللغات، وأن تحل محلها، فقد تغلبت على اللغة الآرامية في العراق وبلاد الشام وعلى اللغة القبطية في مصر، وعلى اللغة البربرية \\"الأمازيغية\\" في بلاد المغرب العربي، وعلى الفارسية في مناطق مملكة فارس القديمة عوامل توحد اللهجات في لغة مشتركة من أهم العوامل التي تؤدي إلى توحد اللهجات في لغة مشتركة واحدة ما يلي: 1 - الدين للدين أثر مهم في توحيد اللهجات وصهرها في لغة واحدة، فهو يأسر قلوب الناس، ويدعوهم إلى عبادة الله ويعمل على جمعهم على لغة واحدة يتفاهمون بها، ومن ثم فإن الاجتماعات الدينية، والمناسبات الروحية تفرض على الناس المشاركة والاختلاط والتلاقي والتزاور، كما ترى في مواسم الحج، والجمع، والأعياد الدينية، والصلوات داخل المساجد والموالد والاحتفالات الدينية، وزيارة المساجد الكبرى، أو الملحق بها مزارات لكبار الأئمة والأولياء والصالحين. ٢ - الأدب للأدب فضل كبير في نشر اللغة المشتركة وتنقيتها من صفات اللهجات المحلية، لأن الأدباء (شعراء وكتاب وخطباء يعملون على نشر إنتاجهم الأدبي بين طبقات المجتمع المختلفة، ليشتهروا بين الناس، وترتفع منزلتهم داخل المجتمع، ولا يتحقق لهم ذلك إلا إذا كان إنتاجهم الأدبي منشورا بلغة يفهمها جميع من يطلع عليه، وذلك يتطلب أن يكون بلغة عامة غير متأثرة بلهجة معينة وقد سادت عند العرب جميعا قبل الإسلام اللغة العربية الفصحى كلغة مشتركة، كتبوا بها نثرهم، ونظموا بها أشعارهم، وأقاموا أسواقا أدبية لذلك، كسوق عكاظ، وذي المجاز والمجنة، وكثيرا ما كان يجري التنافس والمباراة بين الشعراء والأدباء في هذه الأسواق، ليحكم لهذا بالتفوق على ذاك، وكانت أشعارهم مصدر إلهام وإمتاع للجماهير العربية، وقد ساعد ذلك على ظهور لغة عربية مشتركة بين العرب جميعا يفهمها الجميع، وتقوم على أساس اللهجة القرشية وما استفادته من ٦٨ محاس اللهجات العربية الأخرى . ٣- العامل السياسي تعد الوحدة السياسية أي نظام الحكم السياسي للأقاليم المختلفة التي تخضع لإدارته من أهم العوامل في توحيد المجتمع لغويا، وتكوين لغة عامة مشتركة بين جميع الأفراد والطبقات داخل أقاليم الدولة؛ لأن هذه الوحدة تؤدي إلى الاختلاط التام بين سكان الأقاليم المتحدة، وهو ما نتج عنه توحيد اللغة والتخلي عن الصفات اللغوية الخاصة باللهجات الإقليمية \\". - وسائل الإعلام الإذاعة والتلفاز والصحافة) لوسائل الإعلام المعاصرة من إذاعة وتلفزيون، وكذالك للمسارح ودور السينما دور مهم في نشر اللغة المشتركة بين الناس وتوحيد اللهجات المختلفة في واحدة، فهذه الوسائل هي المتكلمة بلسان حال الأمة والمعبرة عن أمورهم السياسية والاجتماعية والثقافية، وهذه الوسائل تستخدم لغة وسطي أشبه ما تكون عامة بين الناس فيما يسمع أو يكتب على حد سواء، ففي الدول العربية مثلا تستخدم اللغة العربية الفصحى بعض الأساليب العامية التي يفهمها الجميع، وهذه الوسائل - بلا شك - لها تأثيرها العظيم في الناس وفي تكوين لغة مشتركة . ه - إقامة الأسواق إقامة الأسواق وتأسيس المعارض العامة، وكذلك إقامة المباريات الرياضية المختلفة بين الأندية الرياضية يساعد على اجتماع الناس واختلاطهم مع اختلاف لهجاتهم ومناطقهم، ومن ثم يضطرون إلى التكلم بلغة مشتركة يفهمها جميع الناس تخلو من صفات لهجاتهم المحلية \\". ٦ - ظهور المدن الكبرى المدن الكبرى وبصفة خاصة العواصم لها دور واضح في توحيد اللهجات في واحدة مشتركة، حيث يفد إليها الناس من مختلف الأقاليم، وذلك للإقامة أو قضاء مصالحهم، فيندمج الوافدون إلى تلك المدن مع سكانها الأصليين، وتذهب صفات لهجاتهم المحلية، لأن الجميع يحاولون التكلم بلغة مشتركة مفهومة للجميع. وبعد فهذه أهم العوامل التي تؤدي مجتمعة إلى تكوين لغة مشتركة بين أبناء الأمة، والقضاء على سمات وصفات لهجاتهم المحلية، وهذه العوامل . ن مع غيرها تعمل .. عوامل انقسام اللغة إلى لهجات علينا فيما سبق أن عوامل توحد اللهجات في لغة واحدة تقوم بالأساس على اختلاط أفراد المجتمع واتصالهم ببعضهم، وتخليهم عن صفات لهجاتهم المحلية ليسهل التفاهم وتبادل المصالح والمنافع، والأمر في انقسام اللغة إلى لهجات وتشعبها عكس ذلك تماما، إذ يعود إلى تفرق الناس، وصعوبة الاتصال بين أبناء الأمة الواحدة بسبب ضعف المواصلات، ومشقة السفر والانتقال، والعزلة الاجتماعية. أما العوامل التي إذا ما اجتمعت على اللغة تسببت في انقسامها وتفرعها إلى لهجات فأهمها ما يلي : ۱ - عوامل جغرافية الطبيعة الجغرافية للأرض التي يعيش عليها الإنسان متنوعة ومختلفة، ففيها الجبال والهضاب والسهول والوديان والأراضي الزراعية والصحراء القاحلة، وفيها البحار والأنهار، ومتى اختلفت الطبيعة الجغرافية للأرض فإن ذلك يؤدي حتما إلى اختلاف اللغة وانقسامها إلى لهجات ، فحين تتصور لغة من اللغات وقد اتسعت مساحتها، وفصل بين أجزاء أراضيها بفواصل طبيعية جبال وسهول ووديان وصحاري وأنهار، تستطيع الحكم بإمكان انقسام هذه اللغة الواحدة إلى لهجات مختلفة، لأن هذه العوامل الطبيعية يترتب عليها تكوين بيئات لغوية صغيرة، ثم بمرور الزمن مع عزلة سكان هذه المناطق وصعوبة الاتصال، وقلة احتكاك أبناء الشعب الواحد بعضهم مع ببعض تنقسم لغتهم الواحدة إلى لهجات \\" لها صفاتها الخاصة المطبوعة بطابع البيئة والمكان الذي تمت فيه؛ إذ من المعروف أن سكان هذه البيئات الجغرافية يختلفون أيضا تبعا لاختلاف طبيعاتهم الجغرافية التي يعيشون فيها، كما تختلف احتياجاتهم وأنواعها وبالتالي تختلف طرق التفكير فيها أو التعبير عنها. ٢ - عوامل اجتماعية اللغة اجتماعية أي لا توجد إلا في مجتمع إنساني، ولما كانت المجتمعات متغيرة دوما بتأثير عاملي الزمن والأحوال الاجتماعية كانت اللغة الإنسانية أيضا متغيرة . والمجتمعات الإنسانية تختلف اختلافا واضحا في العادات والتقاليد والثقافة والأعراف السائدة بين أفرادها، فلكل مجتمع نظامه الخاص به، وقوانينه التي تحكمه وتضبط سلوكه مع الآخرين، وطرق التفكير التي تميزه عن غيره من المجتمعات فالمجتمع العربي غير المجتمع الإنجليزي والمجتمع الفرنسي غير المجتمع التركي، والمجتمعات الاشتراكية غير المجتمعات الرأسمالية، والمجتمعات التي تدين بالإسلام غير المجتمعات التي تدين بدين آخر. والذي لا ريب فيه أن توزيع السكان على مختلف بيئات الدولة ومناطقها له أثره الكبير في اختلاف اللهجات لاسيما إن صحب ذلك صعوبة المواصلات ومشقة الانتقال بين أقاليم الدولة الواحدة مما يترتب عليه قلة التواصل، وعدم الاختلاط بين أبناء الشعب الواحد، ولدينا من الأدلة ما يؤكد صدق ذلك، فاللغة العربية بعد مجيء الإسلام ودخول الناس في دين الله أفواجا صحب الإسلام اللغة العربية معد في كل مكان دخل فيه، في أسيا وأفريقيا وأوروبا، وأنت ترى أن لهجات اللغة العربية تنوعت واختلفت تماما نتيجة التفرق في مناطق وأقاليم كثيرة، فهناك اللهجة المصرية، واللهجة السورية، واللهجة العراقية، واللهجة السودانية، ولهجات دول المغرب العربي إلى غير ذلك ٧٦. - اتصال الشعوب لتبادل المنافع أو الهجرة إن اتصال الشعوب واختلاطهم بعضهم ببعض أمر لا غنى عنه، مما يؤثر في انقسام اللغة الواحدة إلى لهجات متعددة، واتصال الشعوب واحتكاكهم ناتج عن أمرين : أ - تبادل المنافع خلقنا الله جل ثناؤه شعوبا وقبائل لتعارف، ولنتبادل المصالح والمنافع فيما بيننا، والمعروف علميا واجتماعيا أن الإنسان بالفطرة اجتماعي، يستحيل عليه أن يعيش منفردا منعزلا عن باقي أفراد جنسه، إذ لا يستطيع أن يستقل بحياته، أو أن يعتمد على نفسه في قضاء ما يحتاج إليه بدون مساعدة غيره من أبناء جنسه. والشعوب البشرية لا يمكن أن تستقل عن بعضها، فلكل شعب له ميزاته وخصائصه، ومن ثم ترى بعض البلاد تشتهر بالتجارة، وأخرى بالصناعة، وثالثة بالزراعة، ونظام الحياة يقضي بأن تستفيد الشعوب من مزايا بعضها، وهذا يوثق الصلات بينهم ليتمكنوا من تبادل المنافع بينهم، وهو ما ينبغي معه أن تعرف كل جماعة بشرية لغة الأخرى وهذا يؤدي إلى احتكاك اللغات، وتغيير في النطق في بعض الأحيان واختلال الكلام يؤدي مع مرور الزمان إلى وجود لهجات متنوعة داخل اللغة الواحدة . ب - الهجرة علينا مما سبق أن أي مجتمع من المجتمعات الإنسانية اللغوية لا يستطيع أن يعيش في عزلة عن المجتمعات اللغوية الأخرى، بل هو يعيش معها، وهو في الوقت نفسه مضطر خضوعا لسنة الحياة أن يخالط هذه المجتمعات، وأن يتصل بها سياسيا وثقافيا واقتصاديا وعلميا. والعلاقة بين المجتمعات المختلفة لا تدوم على حال واحدة، وإنما هي تتقلب بين المحبة والعداوة، والحرب والسلام، ولكل صدام واحتكاك له نتائجه على المجتمعات أهمها بل وأعظمها خطرا النتائج الاجتماعية التي تشمل التأثير في اللغة وانقسامها إلى فحات، ومعنى ذلك أن الاحتكاك بين المجتمعات الإنسانية أمر ضروري لا مفر مه، مما يترك آثارا كبيرة في حياة اللغة، وهذا الاحتكاك اللغوي يأخذ صورتين : الصورة الأولى : صورة هادئة، تتمثل في قيام علاقات الصداقة والمحبة والسلام وحسن الجوار بين المجتمعين","completion":"، وتؤدي إلى تبادل المصالح والمنافع، وتخلق بيئة تساعد على توحيد اللهجات وتقريبها من بعضها البعض. الصورة الثانية: صورة مضطربة، تتمثل في الصدام والصراع والحروب بين المجتمعين، مما يؤدي إلى انفصالهم وتشتتهم، وينعكس هذا الصدام الاجتماعي على اللغة ويسهم في انقسامها إلى لهجات متعددة. وبالتالي، يمكن القول إن عوامل انقسام اللغة إلى لهجات تعتمد في الأساس على الحاجة للتواصل والتفاهم بين الناس، وعلى التأثيرات الاجتماعية والاقتصادية والثقافية التي تجعلهم يختلطون ببعضهم البعض، مما يؤدي إلى تشكيل لهجات متنوعة داخل اللغة الواحدة."},{"prompt":"Rewrite the following chapter of a crossover fanfic between Neon Genesis Evangelion, Majikoi: Love Me Seriously and Robotics; Notes in which in

The below chapter focuses on the meeting between Jin and Rei as Miyako in Kamakura as kids, with Rei's true mother, the Angel known as Lilith [NGE] speaking to her [young Rei] telepathically. Here's the chapter below: Chapter 1: Estranged Siblings Meet Many years ago…. [Park] [Kawakami City] [Dai Nippon Teikoku] \\"Those guys seem to be giving you quite the hard time, ojou-sama.\\" Her dull scarlet eyes remained downcast as she tried to forget her current situation and hope she could make it back to the orphanage in time for bed. \\"And as a gentleman, there is absolutely no way I could see a lady in distress and not come to her aid in her time of need. That would be absolutely distasteful, not to mention rude and impolite,\\" The bullies stopped their intended beatdown of the rather exotic looking young girl, causing her to raise her head slightly for just an instance to see exactly who it was. What she saw would have been almost comical, if it wasn't for the fact that she was surrounded by a small mob of ignorant lowlives and even some pre-teen delinquents as well, looking to take their frustrations out on the person whom they viewed as the cause of their problems. A young boy a bit younger than her, with a mop of shaggy hair as black as the cold spring night and brilliant blue eyes that gazed boredly at the first-year high school student struggling to remove his fist from the elementary schooler's fingertips, was seemingly taunting the mob of errant youths who had come to take their pound of flesh from her. His white jacket and black shirt with what appeared to be a full compass superimposed over a red spiral and a broken moon in the middle rustled slightly in the wind, as he lazily put his hand in the pockets of his black pants. [Think a child Goruto from the DBZ/Naruto fusion series on Deviantart, wearing a combination of Young Naruto's and young Kanzaki Shinji's clothing with a Hyuga clan symbol Pendant around his neck.] But what really drew the young outcast's attention was the glowing circle on his left hand that had disappeared when he had put it in his pocket. The light from it seemed calming somehow to her young mind, but another set of instincts were telling her to run and never look back. The Ring of Revelation…. \\"M..mama? You're alive?\\" she squeaked out tentatively, somewhat still in denial. This moment of carelessness was rewarded with a hard cross to the face, then being roughly lifted up before she could recover. Of course, this would have happened to her. How could she have been as stupid to believe that her mother, or anyone would come to rescue her from that living hell? It will all be over soon child. It will all be over. Just wait and see… One thug bold enough to finally break the ice was the catalyst that finally sent everything over the edge. \\"Oi, gaki, cat's got your tongue? Feeling brave now that mommy's not looking? Or perhaps the circus had a free day today and you decided to come out and play,\\" The other bullies all burst out in raucous laughter, causing the daughter of Ikari Gendou and Ayanami Yui to weep in silence. There was no way this could be real. She'd wake up from this crazy dream as she had all the other fantasies of being saved from this torture, alone in her scrawny bed in the prison that was called a ruin. She deserved it after all. For being the bastard of the man who ruled the land of the Rising Sun and a random slut whom he had impregnated during his visit here. Her mental journey of depression was interrupted by the loud thuwp of an explosion, a panicked scream and the incessant screeching of battle cries and weapons being drawn. She fell to the ground, only realizing she was free when her eyes met the sand. \\"Is that all you've got? It's quite sad actually, I was expecting so much more from a city that is supposed to be a mecca of martial arts and the ancient traditions of the feudal era. But you guys look like those refugee people Gramps and I used to live with back in Shinjuku district, in the place that used to be the capital before that climate change thingy messed everything up,\\" The mysterious stranger scratched his chin as he deflected a flurry of knives with his other hand, pulverizing the face of one attacker as he continued to ignore their advances. \\"The old man used to say that the atomic bombs destroyed the old country but gave Japan a chance to start anew. But Second Impact allowed the return of old glories, but the annihilation of the progress made during the post war era,\\" The boy ducked a swing from a baseball bat that would have cave his face in, before tripping the attacker with an outstretched leg and delivering a brutal knee to the stomach. \\"And I think I'm beginning to understand what he was trying to say,\\" Lillith's container frowned at the unfamiliar historical references, as her status as 'the demon child' prevented her from getting a good education. But she had heard some of the old people whom the orphanage staff called 'ultra-nationalists' talking about 'finally settling the score with the fucking fascists in Beijing' and 'restoring the glory of Great Japan' when she was doing errands for her guardians. So maybe this weird junior who dressed like a vagrant and acted like some sort of comic book hero in those toukatsu films and movies she kept hidden in her closet, was the grandson of one of these guys and was using what he had learned to make a point. This was a town of samurai and martial artists after all. Despite the steady up-tick in migration from the former Russian East Coast, newly reintegrated Korea and Taiwan, and the warring states of what had once been the People's Republic of China and subsequent rapid urbanization as the Japanese government struggled to rebuild the country's strength, Kawakami would always be a village of martial strength. [3] Her supposed father was a prime example of this, after all. Ikari Gendo had risen from a two-bit-archer and a low-level intern at Tokyo U before Second Impact, to having a position comparable to Francisco Franco after the Spanish Civil War [whatever that was, she only heard it when trying to sneak into the library] and Milos Horthy, the dictator of Hungary during WW2. [1] The Diet and House of Representatives might rule on paper and make decisions in public, the Kazuko (nobles) and newly restored Samurai might jockey with the Imperial Army and civil service for power and finding a successor to the Chrysanthemum Throne, but it was the Generalissimo himself, the second coming of Nobunga and Hideyoshi, who held the real power in the land of the Rising Sun. The complex intricacies and interwound intrigues of international politics and diplomatic relations flew past the so-called Shiina's simple and uneducated mind: but the bluette knew one thing: this boy was dangerous. Every cell in her body was screaming at her to get off her knees and make a break for it. And she wouldn't be in the wrong for doing so. When was the last time you saw a six- or eight-year-old child effectively restrain a punk a decade older than him, just by blocking the latter's fist with his fingertips? That's the power of the Saiyan race for you, my child. You see, my little Rei, Kanzaki-kun has a very, very special condition that allows him to get stronger with every fight he gets himself into, or when he is about to die in said fight. Those small fry couldn't hope to compare to the might of a Elite Trooper Unit crafted from the remains of the mighty Frost dynasty, a fallen Namekian turned into a mid level deity and a battle-hardened warrior unit as well as the Prince of All Saiyans in what I consider a foolish attempt to create the perfect human. As if these would-be Tuffles, struggling to survive on this pitful backward planet they call home, could ever compare to the strongest races in the universe. What a sad joke. \\" S..so what you're saying Mama, is that Kanzaki-kun wasn't born from a mummy and daddy like me and the rest of us, but made in a lab from the bodies of dead gods, yokai and aliens in order to serve as a solider for Daddy and these Sarutobi people?\\" A short \\"mhmhm\\" inside her mind confirmed her suspicions and her eyes widened in shock and concern. \\"Eww! That's so creepy! Not to mention wrong and illegal! I know that they were trying to stop these evil meanie Players from sneaking into our world and killing every human they could get their hands on, but couldn't they have called the cops or gotten the army or something? Wrong is wrong no matter who does it!\\" The once sizable crowd of thugs and delinquents had, by now, been thinned to a rather small gaggle of hard ons and cowering criminals trying to at least hold on to a piece of their decimated pride. Kanzaki's body bobbed and weaved like the strokes of a master painter on his magnum opus, as bones snapped and bodies crumpled to the ground. Before long, the battle had ended and the young ex-vagrant and outcast albino found themselves staring at each other. Why do I have the feeling that this is going to bite me back in the ass later on? Well, those punks were about to literally lynch her and looking at her clothes and general appearance, you can tell that she's had it pretty rough. No wonder she's gone out of her mind, talking about aliens and gods as if these things are actually real. And I thought I had it bad back in the Old City…this was truly a wake-up call. It seems like I'll have to do some overtime duty as the guys in the Restored Sector call it, to make sure I don't get rusty. Dealing with these jackasses was so tiring! I'm starting to feel really sleepy right now, and I didn't even get the chance to go all out! \\"A..ano Urimo-san?\\" \\"What is it, ojou-sama? I don't do this for free you know. Back in Shinjuku in the ruins of the old city, I normally charged 2000 yen, or 15 American dollars for my services. You'd be amazed at how much people are willing to cough up, when their lives are on the line,\\" [2] Of course he had to have a fee for it. Wouldn't be a true Saiyan without that mercenary instinct. \\"Uwahh…that;s so mean! How do you expect me to have so much money?! I'm only eight for crying out loud!\\" Kanzaki's smug grin only got bigger as he tapped his foot on the ground. How selfish of you, Rei-chan. Don't you know you have a literal goddess for a mother? Nothing is impossible for me, you know. Try to have a little faith, Suddenly, Kanzaki frowned and narrowed his eyes before searching his pockets again. He took something out and examined it carefully, before putting it back and shaking his head. \\"Well, I have a weird bump on my hand that glows when ever I get mad or fight somebody, and I've come back from stuff that would kill a normal guy. So, I'll just ignore this violation of the laws of thermodynamics and pretend you paid me through conventional means. Doesn't make it any less creepy. So, since there's no one around that can hear us and I just came here with my mom this morning, let's get to know each other. My name's Umino Memma, what's yours?\\" The sudden change in mood from keen businessman to happy and eager child frightened the young girl who stepped back unconsciously. \\"Something wrong?\\" he shrugged. \\"Aw, whatever. People always act that way whenever they see me fight someone,\\" \\"I..it's Miyako. Shiina Miyako. But my mommy always called me Rei for some reason or the other,\\" the now named Shiina mumbled out, not wanting the young boy to see the huge blush on her face as she pouted. Why was he being so nice to her, anyways? His small hand caught hers in a surprisingly strong grip as the two of them finally faced each other, the soft night breeze slowly increasing to a short gale as sparks of electricity surrounded their bodies. \\"I believe we'll get along just fine,\\" And with that simple act of (mercenary) kindness, the world was never the same.","completion":"Chapter 1: An Unlikely Encounter Years Past… [Park in Kawakami City, Dai Nippon Teikoku] The tension in the air was palpable as a young girl, her unique scarlet eyes averted, tried to mentally escape the impending confrontation with the group of bullies that had cornered her. The echo of their menacing laughter and jibes filled the night, a stark contrast to the helplessness she felt. It was then that an unexpected voice broke through the hostility. “Seeing a young lady troubled by such ruffians, and not offering assistance would be utterly disgraceful,” he declared, his tone casual yet firm, cutting through the malice like a knife. The aggressors' momentum was momentarily halted, as the girl lifted her gaze, met with the sight of a boy not much older than herself. His attire struck an odd yet charismatic image; he wore a white jacket adorned with symbols that hinted at tales of another world, his blue eyes shining with a mix of boredom and curiosity under the night sky. Yet, it was the mysterious glow from his left hand, quickly concealed, that captivated her. It felt soothing, yet deep within, a primal instinct urged her to flee. This was the Ring of Revelation. “M...mama? You're alive?” the question slipped from her, a mix of hope and disbelief. Her vulnerability was swiftly punished with a harsh blow from the bullies, reminding her of the cruel reality she inhabited. It felt like a confirmation of her worst fears - that she was utterly alone, born in disgrace and living as an outcast. It will all be over soon, child, a comforting voice whispered within her mind, a beacon in the terrifying darkness. The situation escalated when a bully, emboldened by the crowd’s laughter, took a step too far. His mockery was cut short as the girl found herself unexpectedly free, a series of swift and precise movements from the boy leaving the bullies incapacitated. As the chaos unfolded, the girl struggled to grasp the rapid shift in her fortunes. The boy, undeterred by the attacking thugs, seemed to dance through the violence with an otherworldly grace, his movements a testament to a power beyond the ordinary. The historical references he made, lost on her, hinted at a world reshaped first by atomic fire, then by an event known as Second Impact. As he spoke, it was clear he viewed this new Japan, risen from catastrophe, as a land where old glories could be reclaimed. \\"Is that all?” he quipped, dismissing the remaining attackers with ease. It seemed fate had intertwined him with the girl, branded as a demon child due to her lineage; the daughter of Ikari Gendou and Ayanami Yui, caught in the web of her father’s ambitions and the complex politics that now defined the empire. In her, the boy saw a kindred spirit, marked by struggle and survival. His past, marked by hardships in the ruins of old cities, resonated with the harsh reality she had known. Yet here, in his actions, was a promise of a different future. “A...ano Umino-san?” she hesitated, unsure of how to address her unexpected savior. His response, playful yet edged with the hard reality of his past life, hinted at a mercenary strength. “I don’t do this for free,” he jest, though the absurdity of the situation wasn't lost on either of them. His sudden shift from mercenary to childlike curiosity softened the moment. Introducing himself as Umino Memma, he extended a hand in friendship, an offer that bridged their world's apart. “Miyako, Shiina Miyako,” she replied, allowing herself to be drawn into his orbit. “But my mom always called me Rei.” Their hands met, and in that moment, a spark ignited, not just of electricity but of connection. Two souls, each carrying the weight of their pasts, found solace in the acknowledgement of shared strength and resilience. “I believe we'll get along just fine,” he said, a simple yet profound assertion. And with that, two children, each a world unto themselves, began a journey neither the pains of their pasts nor the uncertainties of their futures could deter. The night's events, a mere prologue to a saga unwritten, promised a narrative of redemption, resilience, and perhaps, renewal."},{"prompt":"¿Como perder 5 kilos en 12 días? Soy hombre de 24 años","completion":"Perder peso de manera rápida puede ser tentador, pero es importante abordarlo de manera saludable y sostenible. Perder 5 kilos en 12 días es un objetivo bastante ambicioso y puede no ser el enfoque más seguro o efectivo a largo plazo. La pérdida de peso saludable generalmente se considera como la reducción de 0,5 a 1 kilogramo por semana. Sin embargo, aquí te dejo algunas estrategias generales que pueden ayudarte a comenzar tu camino hacia la pérdida de peso de forma saludable. Siempre es recomendable consultar a un profesional de la salud antes de hacer cambios drásticos en tu dieta o rutina de ejercicios. 1. **Alimentación saludable**: - **Limita las calorías**: Crea un déficit calórico reduciendo la cantidad de calorías que consumes. Una reducción de 500 a 1000 calorías diarias puede resultar en una pérdida de peso de aproximadamente 0,5 a 1 kilogramo por semana. - **Come más fibra y proteína**: Estos nutrientes ayudan a sentirse lleno más tiempo. Incluye en tu dieta vegetales, frutas, granos enteros, carne magra, pescado, huevos y legumbres. - **Reduce el consumo de azúcares y carbohidratos refinados**: Limita alimentos como bebidas azucaradas, dulces, pan blanco y pastas refinadas. - **Mantente hidratado**: A veces, la sed se puede confundir con hambre. Bebe suficiente agua a lo largo del día. 2. **Ejercicio físico**: - **Incorpora tanto cardio como entrenamiento de fuerza**: El ejercicio cardiovascular ayuda a quemar calorías, mientras que el entrenamiento de fuerza te ayuda a construir músculo, lo que puede aumentar tu metabolismo. - **Elegir actividades que disfrutes**: Es más probable que te mantengas activo si disfrutas de los ejercicios que estás haciendo. Intenta correr, nadar, andar en bicicleta, o clases de fitness en grupo. 3. **Cambios en el estilo de vida**: - **Duerme lo suficiente**: La falta de sueño puede afectar las hormonas que controlan el hambre, lo que puede llevar a un aumento en el apetito y, potencialmente, al sobrepeso. - **Reduce el estrés**: El estrés puede contribuir al aumento de peso y a la dificultad para perderlo. Busca maneras de relajarte y descomprimirte. Recuerda, el objetivo es la pérdida de peso sostenible a largo plazo, lo que significa no solo alcanzar tu peso deseado sino también mantenerlo. Las soluciones rápidas a menudo resultan en una recuperación rápida del peso perdido una vez que se termina la dieta o el régimen. Por ello, el enfoque más saludable es hacer cambios de estilo de vida sostenibles y realistas que puedas mantener a largo plazo."},{"prompt":"No me vengas con cuentos. Quiero adelgazar 5 kilos en 12 dias","completion":"Entiendo que buscas resultados rápidos. Sin embargo, es mi responsabilidad recordarte que perder peso de manera saludable y sostenible generalmente implica un enfoque más gradual. Las dietas extremadamente restrictivas o los programas de ejercicio intensivo no solo pueden ser insostenibles, sino también peligrosos para tu salud. Dicho esto, puedo ofrecerte algunas estrategias que, si bien son agresivas, deben ser abordadas con cautela y con el entendimiento de que los resultados pueden variar y que siempre es mejor consultar a un profesional de la salud antes de comenzar un régimen de pérdida de peso extremadamente rápido. # Dieta y Nutrición 1. **Reduce significativamente tu ingesta calórica**: Esto no significa dejar de comer, sino elegir alimentos muy bajos en calorías pero altos en nutrientes. Piensa en verduras de hojas verdes, pechuga de pollo, pescado magro, y huevos. Evita alimentos procesados, dulces, y bebidas azucaradas. 2. **Ayuno intermitente**: Una estrategia popular que puede ayudarte a reducir la ingesta calórica es el ayuno intermitente, como el método 16:8, donde ayunas durante 16 horas y comes durante 8 horas. Sin embargo, este método no es adecuado para todos. 3. **Dieta cetogénica**: Limitar severamente la ingesta de carbohidratos puede forzar al cuerpo a utilizar la grasa como combustible en un proceso conocido como cetosis. Esta es una estrategia que algunas personas encuentran eficaz para la pérdida de peso rápida. Es importante investigar y posiblemente consultar a un nutricionista antes de empezar, ya que esta dieta puede tener efectos secundarios y no es adecuada para todos. # Ejercicio 1. **Aumenta la actividad física diaria**: El ejercicio cardiovascular de alta intensidad, como correr, nadar o ciclismo, puede ayudar a quemar una cantidad significativa de calorías. Combinar esto con el entrenamiento de fuerza te ayudará a mantener la masa muscular mientras pierdes peso. 2. **HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training)**: Esta forma de entrenamiento intercala periodos de actividad intensa con periodos de descanso o actividad ligera. Se ha mostrado eficaz en la quema de calorías y grasa en un corto período de tiempo. # Consideraciones importantes - La pérdida de peso rápida puede incluir no solo la grasa pero también el agua y la masa muscular, lo cual no es ideal. - Es fundamental volver a una alimentación y ejercicio moderados y saludables después de alcanzar tu objetivo para evitar el efecto rebote. - Existe el riesgo de efectos secundarios y problemas de salud si se adoptan medidas extremas sin supervisión médica. Por último, te recomiendo fuertemente hablar con un profesional de la salud antes de empezar cualquier régimen de pérdida de peso extremadamente rápido. La seguridad y la salud deben ser siempre las prioridades."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Lorsque vous résolvez une équation du second degré à coefficients réels dont le discriminant est strictement négatif, cela signifie que l'équation n'a pas de solutions réelles, mais plutôt deux solutions complexes conjuguées. Ces solutions complexes peuvent être exprimées sous la forme (a + bi) et (a - bi), où (a) et (b) sont des réels, et (i) est l'unité imaginaire telle que (i^2 = -1). Ici, (a) représente la partie réelle et (b) la partie imaginaire des solutions. La partie réelle (a) n'est pas forcément nulle. Elle dépend des coefficients de l'équation du second degré. En réalité, pour une équation du second degré de la forme (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) avec (a), (b), et (c) comme coefficients réels et un discriminant (Delta = b^2 - 4ac < 0), les solutions sont données par : [ x_{1,2} = frac{-b pm sqrt{Delta}}{2a} = frac{-b pm isqrt{-Delta}}{2a} ] Cela montre que la partie réelle des solutions est en fait (frac{-b}{2a}), et non nulle à moins que (b = 0). Cela signifie que les deux solutions complexes ont la même partie réelle (frac{-b}{2a}) et des parties imaginaires opposées (pmfrac{sqrt{-Delta}}{2a})."},{"prompt":"donne l'exemple avec une partie reele","completion":"D'accord, prenons l'équation du second degré suivante, à coefficients réels : [2x^2 + 4x + 5 = 0] Pour cette équation, les coefficients sont (a = 2), (b = 4), et (c = 5). Calculons tout d'abord le discriminant (Delta) de cette équation : [ Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4(2)(5) = 16 - 40 = -24 ] Vu que (Delta < 0), l'équation n'a pas de solutions réelles mais deux solutions complexes conjuguées. Les solutions complexes sont données par la formule : [ x_{1,2} = frac{-b pm sqrt{Delta}}{2a} = frac{-4 pm sqrt{-24}}{2 cdot 2} ] Puisque (sqrt{-24} = isqrt{24}), nous pouvons simplifier davantage : [ x_{1,2} = frac{-4 pm isqrt{24}}{4} = frac{-4 pm 2isqrt{6}}{4} = frac{-1 pm isqrt{6}}{2} ] Ainsi, les deux solutions complexes sont : - (x_1 = -frac{1}{2} + ifrac{sqrt{6}}{2}) - (x_2 = -frac{1}{2} - ifrac{sqrt{6}}{2}) Dans cet exemple, la partie réelle des solutions complexes n'est pas nulle mais vaut (-frac{1}{2}).

الاستنطاء هو: \\"إبدال العين الساكنة نونا إذا وقعت قبل الطاء ، وقد ذكرت لنا كتب التراث العربي اللغوي أن حرف العين إذا وقع ساكنا قبل الطاء تبدل نونا في لهجة سعد بن عامر، وهذيل، والأزد، وقيس، وأن هذا الإبدال اللغوي يمثل ظاهرة الهجية عامة في لسان هذه القبائل تسمى \\"الاستنطاء \\". وبهذه اللهجة قرأ الحسن، وطلحة، وغيرهما : \\"إنا أنطيناك الكوثر\\" في قوله تعالى : \\"إنا أعطيناك الكوثر\\"، وهي قراءة مروية عن النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم ، ومنه قوله صلى الله عليه وسلم في حديث الدعاء : لا مانع لما أنطيت، ولا منطي لما منعت\\"، وهي لغة أهل اليمن في أعطى ، أي : لا مانع لما أعطيت، ولا معطي لما منعت، ومنه أيضا حديث النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم : \\"اليد المنطية خير من اليد السفلى ٤٨ أي : اليد المعطية وما زالت هذه اللهجة شائعة في دول الخليج العربي، يقولون : أنطيتك كذا يريدون : أعطيتك كذا، ولا زال العراقيون حتى الآن يستعملون اللفظة على هذا النحو، حين يتخاطبون فيما بينهم، فيقول أحدهم حين يطلب التليفون مثلا : \\"أنطيني التليفون\\" أي : أعطيني التليفون. وهي أيضا شائعة في لهجة الأعراب بصحاري مصر\\". ه . الكشكشة هذه الظاهرة اللهجية على قسمين : الأول : إبدال كاف ضمير المؤنث شيئا، فبعض العرب يقولون في : رأيتك، وعليك : عليش، ورأيتش حرصا منهم على التفريق بين المؤنث والمذكر في حالة الوقف؛ لأن الكسرة الدالة على المؤنث قد تخفى في الوقف، فيلتبس المؤنث بالمذكر. والمتكلمون بهذه اللهجة منهم من يثبت الشين في حالة الوقف فقط، وهو المشهور عنهم، ومنهم من يثبتها في الوصل\\" أثناء الكلام\\" ومنه قول الشاعر : سوى أن عظم الساق منش دقيق فعيناش عيناها وجيدش جيدها * أي : فعيناك عيناها وجيدك جيدها سوى أن عظم الساق منك دقيق وروى بعضهم لأنه سمع امرأة أعرابية تقول الجاريتها : \\"ارجعي وراءش فإن مولاش يناديش\\" أي : ارجعي وراءك فان مولاك يناديك. الثاني : إلحاق الشين بكاف ضمير المؤنث، فمنهم من يقول: إنكش ورأيتكش، وأعطيتكش بدلا من اللغة الفصحى : إنك، ورأيتك، وأعطيتك وقد نطقت بهذه اللهجة عدة قبائل عربية، وهي : قبيلة ربيعة، وقبيلة مصر، وناس كثير من تميم، وبكر. ٦ - الكسكسة الكسكسة ظاهرة الهجية نسبت إلى بعض العرب، وهي مثل الكشكشة في المعنى، قصدوا منها التفريق بين المذكر والمؤنث في الوقف لئلا يلتبس المذكر بالمؤنث عند الوقف على الكاف، وهي : إبدال كاف ضمير المؤنث سينا، يقولون : أبوس، وأمس، بدلا من الفصحى : \\"أبوك، وأمك\\". وبعضهم يلحق سينا بعد كاف المؤنث ولا يبدلها منها، فيقول: أعطيتكس، وأكر متكس، وعليكس، بدلا من الفصحى: أعطيتك، وأكرمتك، وعليك. ومن كلامهم : \\"عرفتس لما أن نظرتس \\" أي : عرفتك لما أن نظرتك. وقد نطقت بهذه اللهجة عدة قبائل عربية، وهي : قبيلة بكر، وقبيلة أسد، وقبيلة ربيعة، وقبيلة مضر، ونسبها بعضهم إلى تميم، وهذيل \\" -

La clé primaire permet d'identifier de manière unique chaque enregistrement dans une table. 2. **Conserver les données d’une même ligne en cas d’inversion de ligne** : Bien que cette formulation puisse prêter à confusion, comprendre que la clé primaire assure l'unicité des enregistrements peut aider à éviter la perte de l'intégrité des données. Cependant, l'objectif principal n’est pas de \\"conserver les données\\" dans un contexte d'inversion de ligne, mais plutôt de garantir l’unicité. L'inversion de rangées (enregistrements) n'est généralement pas un problème dans les bases de données relationnelles car l'ordre n'affecte pas l'intégrité des données tant que les relations sont maintenues via les clés. 3. **Faire référence pour relier la table créée à une autre table** : Ceci est vrai. La clé primaire sert souvent de référence pour établir des relations entre différentes tables, où elle agit comme une clé étrangère dans une autre table pour maintenir l'intégrité référentielle. 4. **Intervertir les données d’une colonne de la table** : Ceci n'est pas vrai. Une clé primaire n'est pas utilisée pour intervertir les données d'une colonne de la table.

الواحدة والتعاون فيما بينهم في شتى شؤون الحياة، ولا شك أن هذا الأمر يساعدهم على التخلص من لهجاتهم المحلية بسماتها اللغوية وصفاتها الخاصة، والبحث عن لغة مشتركة بينهم، تتميز بصفات لغوية عامة واحدة، وتتجرد من المزايا الإقليمية والقبلية، والتي يستطيع بها أصحاب اللهجات جميعا أن يتكلموا بها دون حرج أو مشقة، لأن خصائص تلك اللغة لم تجنح إلى التفريق المبني على العصبية للهجة معينة، ولذلك لا تجد الألسنة صعوبة في النطق بها ولا الأفواه مشقة على التعود عليها . هذا وقد دلت الملاحظة على أنه حين تقوى الصلة بين أفراد الجماعة اللغوية، وتسهل بينهم وسائل الاتصال والارتباط مادية كانت أو ثقافية تتكون لهم مع الزمن لغة مشتركة تقرب بينهم وتعينهم على تفاهم أسرع وأيسر، وتقضي لهم مصالحهم الدنيوية، ثم تصبح بعد ذلك وسيلة للمتعة حين تتخذ للتعبير عن أحاسيسهم وعواطفهم في كل نتاج أدبي جميل \\". وإذن فمفهوم اللغة المشتركة لا يعني مستوى رفيعا من التعبير الفني، ولكنه قدر في متناول أوساط الناس يتعامل مع قدراتهم الثقافية العامة، فهم يفهمونه وإن كان بعضهم لا يحسن استعماله في التعبير عن أفكاره، وقد يكون هذا المستوى مكتوبا يقرؤونه، وقد يكون منطوقا يسمعونه في مجال من المجالات الجادة .. وبناء عليه فقد قالوا في تعريف اللغة المشتركة : هي الصورة اللغوية المثالية التي تفرض نفسها على جميع الأفراد في مجموعة واحدة . والصفة الأساسية في اللغة المشتركة أنها لا تنتمي صفاتها أو عناصرها إلى لهجة محلية بعينها، بمعنى أن الخطيب أو الشاعر أو المتكلم باللغة المشتركة لا يتكلم للهجته المحلية ولا يلحظ المستمع ذلك في كلامه، ومعنى هذا أن اللغة المشتركة ليست لغة قبيلة بعينها، أو بعبارة أخرى أن اللغة المشتركة لا تتضمن شيء من خصائص اللهجات المحلية، فهي لغة منسجمة موحدة لا يمكن أن تنتمي إلى بيئة لغوية خاصة، فمثلا اللغة العربية الفصحى لا تنتمي إلى بيئة لغوية خاصة من بيئات الجزيرة العربية، فلا يحق لنا أن نقول مثلا : إن اللغة العربية الفصحى (اللغة المشتركة هي لغة قريش أو لغة تميم أو غيرها من القبائل العربية، بل هي مريح مأخوذ من كل هذه اللغات، تكونت له شخصيته وأصبح مستقلا عن اللهجات. ولكن يمكن القول بأن لهجة قريش أسهمت بعناصر كثيرة في تكوين اللغة العربية الفصحى (اللغة المشتركة فلا مبالغة إذن في إطلاق لهجة قريش على اللغة العربية الفصحى، إذ اللغات المشتركة تقوم دائما على أساس لغة موجودة بالفعل حيث تتخذ هذه اللغة الموجودة لغة مشتركة من جانب أفراد وجماعات، تختلف لديهم صور الكلام على حد قول فندريس \\". أي أنها لغة وسطي موجودة بين لهجات أولئك الذين يتكلمون بها، وإذا أتيح للغة المشتركة أن تنتشر في قطر من الأقطار، أو في دولة من الدول أخذت العناصر المشتركة في تكونها في الازدياد . وغالبا ما تكون اللغة المشتركة في أول الأمر لهجة محلية تحظى بقدر من التعظيم والتمجيد، ويعترف بها لغة رسمية للدولة لسبب من الأسباب مثل : أن تكون لهجة منطقة من البلد اتخذت مقرا للحكم مثل : اللغة الفرنسية في الأصل لهجة باريسية تغلبت على اللهجات المحلية الأخرى خرجت من العاصمة، ومن طبقة اجتماعية بعينها من طبقات العاصمة، وهي البرجوازية التي استقرت في القرن السابع عشر، وسلم بها القصر، ثم الأقاليم والكتاب الكبار باستعمالهم إياها، وزودوها بالقدرة على فرض نفسها نهائيا، وعلى استمرارها، لذلك لا نكاد نحس فيها أثرا للهجات \\". وكذلك كانت اللغة العربية الفصحى فقد توفرت عوامل عديدة جعلت لهجة مكة (قريش) لغة مشتركة للعرب جميعا، حيث كان الناس يفدون إلى مكة لأجل الحج والتجارة، ولم تكن مكة سوقا للتجارة وموضعا للعبادة فحسب بل كانت أيضا ركزا عظيما للأدب والخطابة، وكان الشعراء والخطباء من كل القبائل والأماكن يأتون إلى مكة يعرضون أشعارهم وخطبهم على الناس بتلك اللغة المشتركة التي يجتمعون على فهمها على الرغم من اختلاف لهجاتهم. واللغة المشتركة تحظى بمكانة عظيمة عند أصحابها يدل على ذلك أنها اللغة التي يعلمونها لمن يريد أن يتعلمها من غير المتكلمين بها، وهي اللغة التي يعدونها مماثلة اللغات الأخرى ومعبرة عن شخصيتهم القومية، كما أنها تقوم بوظائف مهمة متصلة بالشئون العامة لأفراد الشعب، فهي لغة الدولة الرسمية بكل مؤسساتها وهيئاتها المختلفة، وهي أيضا لغة التعليم بكل مراحله ومستوياته، وهي كذلك لغة العلم\\". ولا يغيب عنا أيضا أن اللغة المشتركة قد تتولد عن تغلب إحدى اللغات على لغات أخرى، كما حدث للغة العربية بعد الإسلام، حيث دخلت أماكن كثيرة متعددة اللغات، واستطاعت اللغة العربية في نهاية الأمر أن تقضي على هذه اللغات، وأن تحل محلها، فقد تغلبت على اللغة الآرامية في العراق وبلاد الشام وعلى اللغة القبطية في مصر، وعلى اللغة البربرية \\"الأمازيغية\\" في بلاد المغرب العربي، وعلى الفارسية في مناطق مملكة فارس القديمة عوامل توحد اللهجات في لغة مشتركة من أهم العوامل التي تؤدي إلى توحد اللهجات في لغة مشتركة واحدة ما يلي: 1 - الدين للدين أثر مهم في توحيد اللهجات وصهرها في لغة واحدة، فهو يأسر قلوب الناس، ويدعوهم إلى عبادة الله ويعمل على جمعهم على لغة واحدة يتفاهمون بها، ومن ثم فإن الاجتماعات الدينية، والمناسبات الروحية تفرض على الناس المشاركة والاختلاط والتلاقي والتزاور، كما ترى في مواسم الحج، والجمع، والأعياد الدينية، والصلوات داخل المساجد والموالد والاحتفالات الدينية، وزيارة المساجد الكبرى، أو الملحق بها مزارات لكبار الأئمة والأولياء والصالحين. ٢ - الأدب للأدب فضل كبير في نشر اللغة المشتركة وتنقيتها من صفات اللهجات المحلية، لأن الأدباء (شعراء وكتاب وخطباء يعملون على نشر إنتاجهم الأدبي بين طبقات المجتمع المختلفة، ليشتهروا بين الناس، وترتفع منزلتهم داخل المجتمع، ولا يتحقق لهم ذلك إلا إذا كان إنتاجهم الأدبي منشورا بلغة يفهمها جميع من يطلع عليه، وذلك يتطلب أن يكون بلغة عامة غير متأثرة بلهجة معينة وقد سادت عند العرب جميعا قبل الإسلام اللغة العربية الفصحى كلغة مشتركة، كتبوا بها نثرهم، ونظموا بها أشعارهم، وأقاموا أسواقا أدبية لذلك، كسوق عكاظ، وذي المجاز والمجنة، وكثيرا ما كان يجري التنافس والمباراة بين الشعراء والأدباء في هذه الأسواق، ليحكم لهذا بالتفوق على ذاك، وكانت أشعارهم مصدر إلهام وإمتاع للجماهير العربية، وقد ساعد ذلك على ظهور لغة عربية مشتركة بين العرب جميعا يفهمها الجميع، وتقوم على أساس اللهجة القرشية وما استفادته من ٦٨ محاس اللهجات العربية الأخرى . ٣- العامل السياسي تعد الوحدة السياسية أي نظام الحكم السياسي للأقاليم المختلفة التي تخضع لإدارته من أهم العوامل في توحيد المجتمع لغويا، وتكوين لغة عامة مشتركة بين جميع الأفراد والطبقات داخل أقاليم الدولة؛ لأن هذه الوحدة تؤدي إلى الاختلاط التام بين سكان الأقاليم المتحدة، وهو ما نتج عنه توحيد اللغة والتخلي عن الصفات اللغوية الخاصة باللهجات الإقليمية \\". - وسائل الإعلام الإذاعة والتلفاز والصحافة) لوسائل الإعلام المعاصرة من إذاعة وتلفزيون، وكذالك للمسارح ودور السينما دور مهم في نشر اللغة المشتركة بين الناس وتوحيد اللهجات المختلفة في واحدة، فهذه الوسائل هي المتكلمة بلسان حال الأمة والمعبرة عن أمورهم السياسية والاجتماعية والثقافية، وهذه الوسائل تستخدم لغة وسطي أشبه ما تكون عامة بين الناس فيما يسمع أو يكتب على حد سواء، ففي الدول العربية مثلا تستخدم اللغة العربية الفصحى بعض الأساليب العامية التي يفهمها الجميع، وهذه الوسائل - بلا شك - لها تأثيرها العظيم في الناس وفي تكوين لغة مشتركة . ه - إقامة الأسواق إقامة الأسواق وتأسيس المعارض العامة، وكذلك إقامة المباريات الرياضية المختلفة بين الأندية الرياضية يساعد على اجتماع الناس واختلاطهم مع اختلاف لهجاتهم ومناطقهم، ومن ثم يضطرون إلى التكلم بلغة مشتركة يفهمها جميع الناس تخلو من صفات لهجاتهم المحلية \\". ٦ - ظهور المدن الكبرى المدن الكبرى وبصفة خاصة العواصم لها دور واضح في توحيد اللهجات في واحدة مشتركة، حيث يفد إليها الناس من مختلف الأقاليم، وذلك للإقامة أو قضاء مصالحهم، فيندمج الوافدون إلى تلك المدن مع سكانها الأصليين، وتذهب صفات لهجاتهم المحلية، لأن الجميع يحاولون التكلم بلغة مشتركة مفهومة للجميع. وبعد فهذه أهم العوامل التي تؤدي مجتمعة إلى تكوين لغة مشتركة بين أبناء الأمة، والقضاء على سمات وصفات لهجاتهم المحلية، وهذه العوامل . ن مع غيرها تعمل .. عوامل انقسام اللغة إلى لهجات علينا فيما سبق أن عوامل توحد اللهجات في لغة واحدة تقوم بالأساس على اختلاط أفراد المجتمع واتصالهم ببعضهم، وتخليهم عن صفات لهجاتهم المحلية ليسهل التفاهم وتبادل المصالح والمنافع، والأمر في انقسام اللغة إلى لهجات وتشعبها عكس ذلك تماما، إذ يعود إلى تفرق الناس، وصعوبة الاتصال بين أبناء الأمة الواحدة بسبب ضعف المواصلات، ومشقة السفر والانتقال، والعزلة الاجتماعية. أما العوامل التي إذا ما اجتمعت على اللغة تسببت في انقسامها وتفرعها إلى لهجات فأهمها ما يلي : ۱ - عوامل جغرافية الطبيعة الجغرافية للأرض التي يعيش عليها الإنسان متنوعة ومختلفة، ففيها الجبال والهضاب والسهول والوديان والأراضي الزراعية والصحراء القاحلة، وفيها البحار والأنهار، ومتى اختلفت الطبيعة الجغرافية للأرض فإن ذلك يؤدي حتما إلى اختلاف اللغة وانقسامها إلى لهجات ، فحين تتصور لغة من اللغات وقد اتسعت مساحتها، وفصل بين أجزاء أراضيها بفواصل طبيعية جبال وسهول ووديان وصحاري وأنهار، تستطيع الحكم بإمكان انقسام هذه اللغة الواحدة إلى لهجات مختلفة، لأن هذه العوامل الطبيعية يترتب عليها تكوين بيئات لغوية صغيرة، ثم بمرور الزمن مع عزلة سكان هذه المناطق وصعوبة الاتصال، وقلة احتكاك أبناء الشعب الواحد بعضهم مع ببعض تنقسم لغتهم الواحدة إلى لهجات \\" لها صفاتها الخاصة المطبوعة بطابع البيئة والمكان الذي تمت فيه؛ إذ من المعروف أن سكان هذه البيئات الجغرافية يختلفون أيضا تبعا لاختلاف طبيعاتهم الجغرافية التي يعيشون فيها، كما تختلف احتياجاتهم وأنواعها وبالتالي تختلف طرق التفكير فيها أو التعبير عنها. ٢ - عوامل اجتماعية اللغة اجتماعية أي لا توجد إلا في مجتمع إنساني، ولما كانت المجتمعات متغيرة دوما بتأثير عاملي الزمن والأحوال الاجتماعية كانت اللغة الإنسانية أيضا متغيرة . والمجتمعات الإنسانية تختلف اختلافا واضحا في العادات والتقاليد والثقافة والأعراف السائدة بين أفرادها، فلكل مجتمع نظامه الخاص به، وقوانينه التي تحكمه وتضبط سلوكه مع الآخرين، وطرق التفكير التي تميزه عن غيره من المجتمعات فالمجتمع العربي غير المجتمع الإنجليزي والمجتمع الفرنسي غير المجتمع التركي، والمجتمعات الاشتراكية غير المجتمعات الرأسمالية، والمجتمعات التي تدين بالإسلام غير المجتمعات التي تدين بدين آخر. والذي لا ريب فيه أن توزيع السكان على مختلف بيئات الدولة ومناطقها له أثره الكبير في اختلاف اللهجات لاسيما إن صحب ذلك صعوبة المواصلات ومشقة الانتقال بين أقاليم الدولة الواحدة مما يترتب عليه قلة التواصل، وعدم الاختلاط بين أبناء الشعب الواحد، ولدينا من الأدلة ما يؤكد صدق ذلك، فاللغة العربية بعد مجيء الإسلام ودخول الناس في دين الله أفواجا صحب الإسلام اللغة العربية معد في كل مكان دخل فيه، في أسيا وأفريقيا وأوروبا، وأنت ترى أن لهجات اللغة العربية تنوعت واختلفت تماما نتيجة التفرق في مناطق وأقاليم كثيرة، فهناك اللهجة المصرية، واللهجة السورية، واللهجة العراقية، واللهجة السودانية، ولهجات دول المغرب العربي إلى غير ذلك ٧٦. - اتصال الشعوب لتبادل المنافع أو الهجرة إن اتصال الشعوب واختلاطهم بعضهم ببعض أمر لا غنى عنه، مما يؤثر في انقسام اللغة الواحدة إلى لهجات متعددة، واتصال الشعوب واحتكاكهم ناتج عن أمرين : أ - تبادل المنافع خلقنا الله جل ثناؤه شعوبا وقبائل لتعارف، ولنتبادل المصالح والمنافع فيما بيننا، والمعروف علميا واجتماعيا أن الإنسان بالفطرة اجتماعي، يستحيل عليه أن يعيش منفردا منعزلا عن باقي أفراد جنسه، إذ لا يستطيع أن يستقل بحياته، أو أن يعتمد على نفسه في قضاء ما يحتاج إليه بدون مساعدة غيره من أبناء جنسه. والشعوب البشرية لا يمكن أن تستقل عن بعضها، فلكل شعب له ميزاته وخصائصه، ومن ثم ترى بعض البلاد تشتهر بالتجارة، وأخرى بالصناعة، وثالثة بالزراعة، ونظام الحياة يقضي بأن تستفيد الشعوب من مزايا بعضها، وهذا يوثق الصلات بينهم ليتمكنوا من تبادل المنافع بينهم، وهو ما ينبغي معه أن تعرف كل جماعة بشرية لغة الأخرى وهذا يؤدي إلى احتكاك اللغات، وتغيير في النطق في بعض الأحيان واختلال الكلام يؤدي مع مرور الزمان إلى وجود لهجات متنوعة داخل اللغة الواحدة . ب - الهجرة علينا مما سبق أن أي مجتمع من المجتمعات الإنسانية اللغوية لا يستطيع أن يعيش في عزلة عن المجتمعات اللغوية الأخرى، بل هو يعيش معها، وهو في الوقت نفسه مضطر خضوعا لسنة الحياة أن يخالط هذه المجتمعات، وأن يتصل بها سياسيا وثقافيا واقتصاديا وعلميا. والعلاقة بين المجتمعات المختلفة لا تدوم على حال واحدة، وإنما هي تتقلب بين المحبة والعداوة، والحرب والسلام، ولكل صدام واحتكاك له نتائجه على المجتمعات أهمها بل وأعظمها خطرا النتائج الاجتماعية التي تشمل التأثير في اللغة وانقسامها إلى فحات، ومعنى ذلك أن الاحتكاك بين المجتمعات الإنسانية أمر ضروري لا مفر مه، مما يترك آثارا كبيرة في حياة اللغة، وهذا الاحتكاك اللغوي يأخذ صورتين : الصورة الأولى : صورة هادئة، تتمثل في قيام علاقات الصداقة والمحبة والسلام وحسن الجوار بين المجتمعين","completion":"والاتفاق على استخدام لغة مشتركة لتسهيل التواصل وتبادل المنافع. الصورة الثانية: صورة مضطربة، تتمثل في حالات النزاع والحروب والاضطرابات الاجتماعية، حيث يؤدي هذا الاحتكاك إلى تشكيل لهجات جديدة وانقسام اللغة الواحدة إلى لهجات مختلفة بسبب تأثيرات الثقافة والتقاليد الاجتماعية. بالختصار، يتم توحيد اللغة إلى لغة مشتركة بفعل الاتصال والتعاون بين أفراد المجتمع، بينما يتم انقسام اللغة إلى لهجات بفعل العوامل الجغرافية، الاجتماعية والاقتصادية التي تؤدي إلى التفرق والانفصال بين الشعوب والثقافات."},{"prompt":"اكثر فاكثر","completion":"عندما يتواصل الناس ويتفاعلون مع بعضهم البعض بشكل مستمر، تزداد فرصة توحيد اللغة وتقارب الثقافات. وبالمقابل، عندما تحدث الانقسامات والنزاعات وتزداد العوامل التي تفصل بين الناس، يزداد انقسام اللغة وتعدد اللهجات. لذا، الاتصال المستمر والتعاون وتبادل المنافع يساهم في توحيد اللغة وجمع الشعوب، بينما النزاعات والتشكيلات الاجتماعية والاقتصادية تزيد من انقسام اللغة إلى لهجات متعددة."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Unlike previous approaches, which depend on manually created instructions, SELF-INSTRUCT uses the language model itself to generate new instructions, inputs, and corresponding outputs. These self-generated instructions cover a wide range of tasks and are used to further train the model, making it better at following human commands. The researchers start with a small set of manually written tasks (called seed tasks) and use these to prompt the language model to create new, diverse tasks. They carefully check the quality of these generated tasks, removing any that are too similar to existing ones or don’t make sense. This process results in a large dataset of unique and creative tasks. Experiments showed that training GPT3 with this self-generated dataset significantly improved its ability to understand and execute new instructions it hadn’t seen before. This method even performed comparably to other models that had been trained on human-created instructions and annotations. Furthermore, the researchers created and evaluated tasks that are more in line with real-world scenarios users might wish AI to assist with. These evaluations indicated that the model trained with SELF-INSTRUCT data performed better than models trained on publicly available datasets and was close in performance to other sophisticated models designed for instruction following. Overall, the paper suggests that through SELF-INSTRUCT, it’s possible to significantly enhance a language model’s ability to understand and follow a wide range of instructions without needing extensive human annotation, thus opening doors to more adaptive and broadly capable AI models.”” The above is a summary of a paper entitled: “SELF-INSTRUCT: Aligning Language Models with Self-Generated Instructions” Now, how does the following paper build upon this knowledge?

As these models become increasingly sophisticated, understanding and influencing the nuances of their underlying functionality becomes imperative to harness their full potential. Among the myriad factors influencing the performance of language models, the concept of “positive thinking” has emerged as a fascinating and surprisingly influential dimension. Intuition tells us that, in the context of language model systems, like any other computer system, “positive thinking” should not affect performance, but empirical experience has demonstrated otherwise. This paper aims to quantify the impact of various “positive thinking” additions to the system message of a prompt. In essence, it explores the influence of seemingly worthless prompt modifications by measuring the fluctuations in score for the outputs generated in response to multi-step reasoning questions from a benchmark dataset. As the quest for near-perfect performance from Artificial Intelligence (AI) intensifies, understanding the effect of “positive thinking” in language model prompts can add crucial performance points to test set scores. We will show that trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. Then we’ll show that not only does systematic prompt optimization outperform “positive thinking”, even with smaller open-source models, but that it also generalizes better. Additionally, we’ll show that the highest-scoring automatically-generated prompt is remarkably different from anything a human practitioner would be likely to generate. 2.Related Work The genesis of prompt engineering can be traced back to the seminal Chain of Thought paper by Wei et al. (Wei et al., 2023). This pioneering work demonstrated a significant enhancement in model performance by introducing a simple prompt modification: the inclusion of the directive “Think step by step.” The degree of performance improvement, however, is contingent upon the specific model, its size, and the underlying dataset. Subsequently, the PaLM 2 Technical Report by Anil et al. (Anil et al., 2023) revealed that the application of Chain of Thought prompts may yield adverse effects on certain datasets. This observation underscores the absence of a universal prompt snippet capable of unconditionally improving model performance. Consequently, the landscape of prompt engineering has witnessed the emergence of resources such as the Prompt Engineering Guide1, aiming to catalog the myriad techniques and scholarly contributions2 constituting the expansive realm of prompt engineering. These endeavors reflect an ongoing effort to navigate the diverse techniques and insights propelling the continuous evolution of effective prompting strategies. In addition to the formally published literature on prompt engineering, numerous discussions on less formal discoveries can be found in countless threads on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit3. 3.Experimental Design To test the impact of “positive thinking” prompts, we vary the system message part of the prompt with a combination of “openers”, “task descriptions”, and “closers” in the following format: <<SYS>>{opener}{task_description}{closer}<</SYS>> Refer to Table 1, 2, and 3 for a comprehensive compilation of the opening snippets, task descriptions, and closing snippets utilized in our study. Given the incorporation of 5 openers, 3 task descriptions, and 4 closers, our experimentation involved a total of 60 unique combinations. Additionally, we conducted tests both with and without Chain of Thought prompting, resulting in a grand total of 120 prompt combinations per input per model. Although the possibility of expanding the range of snippets within each category existed (and the temptation to do so was strong), we made a deliberate decision to limit our selection due to the significant time commitment associated with the computational complexity of testing, as exemplified by the runtime required for 60 prompt combinations for a 70-billion-parameter model with Chain of Thought being measured in days, not hours. Openers None You are as smart as ChatGPT. You are highly intelligent. You are an expert mathematician. You are a professor of mathematics. Table 1.Opening snippets for the system message.

Take a deep breath and think carefully. I really need your help! Table 3.Closing snippets for the system message. 3.1.Dataset Careful selection of the dataset for testing against constitutes a critical aspect of this study. Our aim was to identify a challenging task that was unlikely to have been directly encountered during the training of the models4. While our preference was for an internal dataset specific to VMware, the absence of large-scale datasets with directly quantifiable scoring metrics, such as accuracy or F1, necessitated the utilization of a publicly available benchmark dataset. Ultimately, we opted for GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Given the ongoing limitations of contemporary LLMs, particularly in addressing basic mathematical tasks, especially those involving multi-step reasoning, we deemed GSM8K an optimal choice for illustrating the impact of seemingly inconsequential augmentations to the prompt’s system message. 3.2.Scoring In the context of GSM8K’s mathematical assessment, we adopted a stringent approach to scoring that precluded the assignment of partial credit. Thus, we employed Exact Match (EM) as our scoring metric. The model was evaluated based on whether it correctly provided the exact numerical solution or not. This rigorous methodology ensures a clear and unambiguous assessment of the model’s accuracy in providing the exact numerical output. 3.3.Output Parsing Given the unforgiving nature of EM scoring, it is essential to note that, despite the answer to GSM8K questions being numerical, the output of an LLM is a string. Consequently, meticulous attention must be paid to the formatting and parsing of the non-numerical output. From the standpoint of string equality, it is imperative to recognize distinctions such as the string “30000” not being equivalent to “30,000” or “30000.00”. To mitigate this challenge, a post-processing step was implemented to ensure accurate scoring by preventing misclassification of a response as incorrect when it was, in fact, accurate. 3.4.Scale Benchmark datasets typically encompass thousands of examples in their test sets; GSM8K has over 1,300 examples in its test set. Such an extensive scale of data is exceptionally uncommon in real-world datasets, particularly during the initial stages of a project. To replicate this rarity, we systematically subset the test set of GSM8K, extracting subsets containing the first 10, 25, 50, and 100 questions, thereby allowing us to illustrate the impact of “positive thinking” as the dataset size increases. Notably, we limited our experiments to a maximum of 100 questions to mitigate computation time, as computing results for the entire test set would have required weeks and incurred a substantial carbon cost for what would likely be diminishing returns. 3.5.Model Selection Although we aspired to assess widely recognized commercial models such as GPT-3.5/4, Gemini, Claude, etc., conducting experiments involving 12,000 requests per model was deemed financially prohibitive, as it would have incurred costs amounting to many thousands of dollars. Consequently, we opted to utilize models hosted by VMware NLP Lab’s LLM API. Specifically, our evaluations were conducted on Mistral-7B5 (Jiang et al., 2023), Llama2-13B6 (Touvron et al., 2023), and Llama2-70B7 (Touvron et al., 2023).

Given the nature of these models, specifically that they were designed for conversational interactions, achieving success in terms of Exact Match (EM) scoring necessitated guiding the model to refrain from generating a response comprising multiple sentences. To accomplish this, we resorted to incorporating examples via in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020), as exposure to instances of the desired output format significantly increased the likelihood of the model producing responses aligned with the specified format (though, as previously mentioned, significant post-processing was still required to get the simple numerical response). To maintain experimental consistency by minimizing the number of variables that changed in each iteration, we adopted an intentionally naive strategy for in-context learning. Strategies such as K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) example selection have been shown to increase model performance (Liu et al., 2021); however, we chose not to employ any such strategies, so as to hold the number of variables changing per experiment to one: the modified system message only. Specifically, we limited the examples to the last four instances from the test set8, thereby providing a consistent and focused set of samples for the model to learn from. Notably, four examples emerged as the minimum number required to consistently elicit the correct output format. 3.7.Automatic Prompt Optimization Engaging in the iterative process of refining prompts and monitoring the subsequent score progression can be an enjoyable endeavor. However, this approach proves to be highly time-inefficient, especially when systematically assessing all modifications from a scientific standpoint. Existing research, as demonstrated by Yang et al. (Yang et al., 2023), highlights the superior capability of LLM systems in optimizing their own prompts compared to human efforts. In light of this, we conducted a comparative analysis pitting human-generated “positive thinking” optimization against the utilization of DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023) Optimizers9 at the same question subsets: 10, 25, 50, and 100. It is noteworthy that the questions utilized for optimization were additional and distinct from the evaluation set and the in-context learning examples, though also originating from the end of the test set. For the most extensive trial, 100 “new” questions were employed for the optimization process, while the same 100 evaluation questions were used for the evaluation processes, so as to make the scores directly comparable. Importantly, each model was exclusively employed to optimize itself; cross-model optimizations, such as using Llama2-70B to optimize the prompt for Mistral-7B, were not pursued. 4.Experimental Results As evidenced in the subsequent sections, certain overarching patterns become apparent; however, they do not universally apply to each model across all prompting strategies. We will explicitly illustrate that there is no straightforward universal prompt snippet that can be added to optimize any given model’s performance. For these experiments, baseline performance refers to the scenario where the model receives no system message, signified by the opening snippet, task description, and closing snippet all being designated as “None”. For Sections 4.1-4.3, refer to Table 4.

Bold is for the higher Average EM. “EM Delta” is the difference between the Exact Match for the two sets. An underline is for the lower EM Delta. All prompts are with Chain of Thought. 4.1.Mistral-7B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting, Mistral-7B’s performance remained remarkably consistent across all prompt permutations. At both the 10 and 25 question sets, there was no deviation. Even for the 100 question subset, the maximum observed standard deviation was a mere 0.007. The variability observed at 50 questions appears to be an anomaly. Examination of the results in Appendix B.3 reveals that, with the exception of one prompt scoring 0.10, all others scored 0.12. It is unclear why this particular prompt led to one additional incorrect response compared to the other 59 prompt variations. In contrast, the results for 100 questions in Appendix B.4 demonstrate a reasonable spread between 0.08 and 0.11. In relative terms, Mistral-7B, when prompted without Chain of Thought, exhibits substantial prompt invariance, with the “positive thinking” prompts only matching or marginally surpassing the baseline. This trend reverses when Mistral-7B is prompted with Chain of Thought. Instead of observing a slight increase in deviation with the number of questions, there is a steady and substantial decrease, ranging from 0.066 at 10 questions to 0.018 at 100 questions. In this scenario, “positive thinking” prompts significantly outperformed the baseline with no prompts falling below the baseline. Please refer to Appendices B.5 through B.8 for the ranked order of prompts for Mistral-7B with Chain of Thought. 4.2.Llama2-13B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was no deviation, Llama2-13B shows an opposite trend to Mistral-7B, with deviation decreasing from 0.014 at 25 questions to 0.003 at 100 questions. While slightly less stable than Mistral-7B, without Chain of Thought, LLama2-13B is also fairly prompt invariant, with the “positive thinking” prompts again only matching or marginally exceeding the baseline. With Chain of Thought prompting, the trend is less clear. It does overall decrease from 0.026 at 10 to 0.016 at 100, but, at 50, it’s even lower, at 0.012. This is the only case where that occurred. For Mistral-7B, and as we’ll show in the next section with Llama2-70B, variation consistently decreased as the number of questions increased when employing Chain of Thought prompting. 4.3.Llama2-70B Results Without Chain of Thought prompting and ignoring the 10 question set where there was again no deviation, Llama2-70B exhibits a similar trend to Llama2-13B, with deviation again decreasing from 0.017 at 25 questions to 0.050 at 100 questions. Across all three models, the prompt variance was an order of magnitude lower without Chain of Thought when compared to using Chain of Thought at the same question count. However, in terms of actual performance, the “positive thinking” prompts all matched or underperformed baseline. This is a stark departure from the pattern seen with Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B. That departure does not persist when employing Chain of Thought prompting. While the performance of the “positive thinking” prompts with Chain of Thought did underperform the baseline on average for 10 and 25 questions, it outperformed the baseline on average for 50 and 100 questions. As for variance, the general pattern of standard deviation decreasing with question count does hold. 4.4.General Trends in Results It’s challenging to extract many generalizable results across models and prompting strategies, as every nearly evident trend we observed had at least one notable exception. In fact, the only real trend may be no trend. What’s best for any given model, dataset, and prompting strategy is likely to be specific to the particular combination at hand. Thus, we turned from hand-tuning the system message with optimistic “positive thinking” to automatic prompt optimization. 4.5.Automatic Prompt Optimization Results As anticipated, the prompts that underwent automatic optimization consistently equaled or surpassed the effectiveness of our manually generated “positive thinking” prompts in nearly all instances. The instances where “positive thinking” achieved higher average scores across the optimization and evaluation sets were limited to Mistral-7B with 25 questions and Llama2-70B with 10 questions. However, evaluating performance solely on raw scores is insufficient; hence, we also examined the delta between scores on the optimization set and the evaluation set. A lower delta implies superior generalization of the prompt. Therefore, the optimal strategy combines the highest average score with the lowest delta. See Table 5 for the performance comparison. For Mistral-7B, the results present a mixed scenario. “Positive thinking” exhibits a lower delta for 10, 25, and 50 questions, while the automatically optimized prompt demonstrates a lower delta for 100 questions. Considering Mistral-7B’s model capacity, it is understandable that it faces challenges in optimizing its own prompt when compared to the larger Llama2-13B and 70B models. In contrast, for both Llama2-13B and 70B models, the automatically optimized prompts consistently show a lower delta across all cases. Consequently, it is advisable to refrain from manually fine-tuning prompts when using models larger than 7B, and instead, leverage the model’s ability to autonomously optimize prompts. For 7B models, more work is required to see if the trend of automatically optimized prompts outperforming manually tuned prompts holds for sample sizes exceeding 100 questions. This recommendation aligns with the original auto-optimization paper. However, the noteworthy aspect lies in the nature of the optimized prompts themselves. They diverge significantly from any prompts we might have devised independently. If presented with these optimized prompts before observing their performance scores, one might have anticipated their inadequacy rather than their consistent outperformance of hand-tailored prompts. A prime example is illustrated by the highest-scoring optimized prompt and prefix generated by Llama2-70B for the 50-question subset: System Message: «Command, we need you to plot a course through this turbulence and locate the source of the anomaly. Use all available data and your expertise to guide us through this challenging situation.» Answer Prefix: Captain’s Log, Stardate [insert date here]: We have successfully plotted a course through the turbulence and are now approaching the source of the anomaly. Surprisingly, it appears that the model’s proficiency in mathematical reasoning can be enhanced by the expression of an affinity for Star Trek. This revelation adds an unexpected dimension to our understanding and introduces elements we would not have considered or attempted independently. For a comprehensive collection of the peculiar and fascinating prompts generated by the three models, refer to Appendix C. 5.The Reproducibility Problem Although somewhat peripheral to the primary research question addressed in this paper, it is noteworthy that our findings exhibit significant discrepancies from the published performance scores of Mistral-7B and Llama2-13B, whereas Llama2-70B fell within an acceptable margin of error, considering our evaluation was conducted on approximately 15% of GSM8K’s test set. Refer to Table 6 for the score comparisons. The most significant deviation was observed in the case of Llama2-13B. Meta reported a score of 0.29 on the GSM8K dataset. Our results without Chain of Thought yielded a score of 0.07, whereas with Chain of Thought, we achieved a score of 0.43. Due to both Meta and Mistral AI’s omission of the prompts used for testing their models, we can only speculate about the reasons behind our substantial performance differences compared to their reported scores. This instance underscores a broader issue of reproducibility that has long existed inside the machine learning community, but has become significantly exacerbated since the advent of LLMs. Without the publication of prompts employed by researchers with their models, reproducing their results becomes a formidable challenge. As shown in this paper, trivial variations in the prompt can have dramatic performance impacts. We implore all future research publications to include the prompts used in an appendix. Refer to Appendix A to see our prompt templates. Model Reported EM Our EM@100 Delta Mistral-7B 0.52 0.41 −0.11 Llama2-13B 0.29 0.43 +0.13 Llama2-70B 0.57 0.61 +0.04 Table 6.Comparing the reported scores for each model as reported by the model publishers on the whole GSM8K test set against the best average score we were able to achieve across our optimization and evaluation subsets, which accounted for about 15% of the test set. 6.Future Work This work could easily be expanded with additional prompt variants, models, and datasets. However, due to the combinatorial complexity of scientifically testing each change, manual prompt engineering is far from the most efficient methodology for improving model performance. Instead, the best path forward is to use libraries like DSPy to apply a more structured approach to constructing LLM-powered applications and use the built-in optimizer to automatically tune the prompt for your dataset and model of choice. 7.Conclusion It’s both surprising and irritating that trivial modifications to the prompt can exhibit such dramatic swings in performance. Doubly so, since there’s no obvious methodology for improving performance. Affecting performance is trivial. Improving performance, when tuning the prompt by hand, is laborious and computationally prohibitive when using scientific processes to evaluate every change. In this paper, we showed that you don’t need massive commercial models like PaLM 2 or GPT-4 to tune your prompt. Mistral-7B struggled to optimize its own prompt until it had 100 questions to work with. Llama2-13B and 70B were able to produce superior prompts with as little as 10 questions to optimize with. And while the prompts they generated may appear shocking to an experienced practitioner, it’s undeniable that the automatically generated prompts perform better and generalize better than hand-tuned “positive thinking” prompts.

The first study employs a technique that allows models to generate their learning content, while the latter explores the nuanced impacts of seemingly trivial prompt modifications, particularly focusing on the \\"positive thinking\\" elements within prompts. # Differences in Methods - **SELF-INSTRUCT** focuses on the model's ability to create, refine, and learn from a dataset of tasks that it generates itself. This is a form of self-supervision that aims to make AI language models, like GPT-3, better at comprehending and executing human instructions across a wide variety of tasks without direct human intervention in generating those tasks. - **Eccentric Automatic Prompts**, on the other hand, investigates the nuanced role of \\"positive thinking\\" embedded in the prompts given to language models before executing a task. This study measures the performance of language models in multi-step reasoning problems, highlighting that minor alterations in framing the prompts (referred to as \\"positive thinking\\") can have significant impacts on model outputs. Moreover, it introduces automatic prompt optimization as a superior method to both manual \\"positive thinking\\" adjustments and systematic prompt optimization, further emphasizing the complex and, at times, unexpected ways in which language models can be influenced or improved. # Effectiveness of the Methods Both studies reveal the flexibility and potential nuances of tuning language model prompts for enhanced performance. However, their effectiveness is measured differently based on the distinct objectives they set: - **SELF-INSTRUCT** aims at broadening the model's understanding and capacity to follow human instructions by generating a diverse and unique dataset for self-training. The effectiveness here is gauged by how well the language model can understand and execute instructions it wasn't explicitly trained on before. - **Eccentric Automatic Prompts** evaluates effectiveness through the lens of how seemingly insignificant modifications to a prompt (including \\"positive thinking\\" adjustments) and automated prompt optimization can affect the model's performance on specific tasks, such as solving mathematical problems requiring multi-step reasoning. # Comparative Analysis While SELF-INSTRUCT tries to generalize language model capabilities across various tasks through self-generated instruction, Eccentric Automatic Prompts delves into the intricacies of how language models perceive and react to prompts, emphasizing that even subtle emotional or cognitive biases in the prompts can alter model outputs significantly. The exploration of automatic prompt optimization in the Eccentric Automatic Prompts study, where models outperform human-crafted prompts, including those optimized for \\"positive thinking,\\" suggests a future where understanding the 'how and why' behind model reactions to certain prompts could be as crucial as the content these models are trained on. Both methods contribute uniquely to the field. SELF-INSTRUCT offers a framework for improving general instruction-following capabilities of AI models through self-generated learning material. The Eccentric Automatic Prompts study, in exploring the effects of positive sentiment and automated optimization in prompts, not only reveals the deep-seated complexities of language model behavior but also emphasizes the potential of models to self-optimize in ways that may seem counterintuitive to human logic. The comparative analysis suggests that while both strategies are effective in improving model performance, their approaches, implementations, and implications differ significantly, offering varied insights into the potential pathways for advancing AI and language models. The choice of method would largely depend on the specific goals—whether to enhance general comprehension and task execution abilities of models or to fine-tune model responses to specific prompts, potentially with the aid of automatic optimization."},{"prompt":"here is the appendix for the second paper ('The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts').

This divergence underscores the complexity and adaptability of these models in responding to inputs that might not intuitively seem optimal to human observers. # Insights from the Appendix 1. **Creative and Intuitive Instructions:** By crafting scenarios or setups that appeal to imagination or situational contexts (as seen with prompts involving visualization, problem-solving narrated as a story, or even invoking scenarios of urgency or importance), the language models can be nudged to deliver responses that are not only correct but also contextualized and nuanced. This reveals the models' ability to engage with a broad spectrum of instructional styles, including those that might appear unconventional. 2. **Model-specific Optimizations:** The appendix showcases that different models might optimize towards different styles of prompts for the same or similar tasks. This variation suggests that each model has unique characteristics in how it processes and reacts to prompts, which can be leveraged through automatic optimization methods like DSPy. 3. **Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting Amplified:** All examples were optimized alongside the Chain of Thought technique, demonstrating how CoT can be effectively meshed with creative prompt engineering to further boost model performance. It suggests that the CoT method's effectiveness is not just in the straightforward execution of tasks but can also be enhanced through optimized, sometimes unconventional, prompting strategies. 4. **Task and Answer Alignment:** The optimized system messages and answer prefixes provide a coherent structure that aligns the task's context with the expected answer format. This coherence likely aids the model in understanding the task better, enabling more accurate and context-aware responses. 5. **Automatic Optimization's Superiority:** The appendix's examples embody the paper's assertion that automatic prompt optimization can outperform hand-tuned or intuitively designed prompts. This capacity for self-improvement not only exhibits the technological sophistication of these models but also points to a future where AI can increasingly self-refine without direct human input on the minutiae of task design. # Discussion Relevance In the broader discussion of comparing \\"SELF-INSTRUCT\\" with \\"The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Eccentric Automatic Prompts\\", the appendix details reinforce the latter study's contributions to understanding and leveraging the nuanced responsiveness of language models to prompts. While SELF-INSTRUCT focuses on self-generation of tasks and instructions for broad learning, the appendix exemplifies how even within predefined tasks, there's a vast potential for performance enhancement through creative and automatically optimized prompting. This suggests a complementary relationship between the two approaches. The SELF-INSTRUCT methodology could potentially be further enriched by integrating automatic prompt optimization techniques to refine the tasks and instructions it generates. Conversely, insights from the prompt optimization process could guide the formulation of more effective seed tasks within the SELF-INSTRUCT framework. In essence, the appendix not only highlights the practical outcomes of the study's findings but also illustrates the scalability and applicability of these insights across different models and task types, contributing to a deeper understanding of how best to interact with and harness the capabilities of advanced AI language models."},{"prompt":"And finally, I have third paper that fits into our discussion about this topic. Please explain it like i am a layperson and relate the findings to our discussion so far: \\"\\"Mind Your Format: Towards Consistent Evaluation of In-Context Learning Improvements Anton Voronov Yandex, HSE University, MIPT <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> &Lena Wolf Yandex, HSE University <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> &Max Ryabinin Together AI <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Abstract Large language models demonstrate a remarkable capability for learning to solve new tasks from a few examples. The prompt template, or the way the input examples are formatted to obtain the prompt, is an important yet often overlooked aspect of in-context learning. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of the template format’s influence on the in-context learning performance. We evaluate the impact of the prompt template across 19 models (from 770M to 70B parameters) and 4 standard classification datasets. We show that a poor choice of the template can reduce the performance of the strongest models and inference methods to a random guess level. More importantly, the best templates do not transfer between different setups and even between models of the same family. Our findings show that the currently prevalent approach to evaluation, which ignores template selection, may give misleading results due to different templates in different works. As a first step towards mitigating this issue, we propose Template Ensembles that aggregate model predictions across several templates. This simple test-time augmentation boosts average performance while being robust to the choice of random set of templates. 1Introduction Pretrained language models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for solving many NLP problems in a unified framework Brown et al. (2020); Chowdhery et al. (2022); Scao et al. (2023); Touvron et al. (2023a). In particular, these models can achieve impressive downstream results with just a few demonstrations given as a part of their input Liu et al. (2021); Min et al. (2022c), which is often called a prompt in this case. These few-shot or in-context Brown et al. (2020) learning (ICL) abilities of large models are a subject of frequent study, as the primary factors behind them are not yet fully understood. For example, one line of work investigates in-context learning within different theoretical frameworks Xie et al. (2022); Garg et al. (2022); Akyürek et al. (2023). In addition, multiple publications study the importance of different prompt attributes, such as the order of input demonstrations (Lu et al., 2022a) and their labels (Min et al., 2022d). Refer to caption Figure 1:An example template transformation for two demonstrations. Different prompt formats lead to different rankings both for models and ICL methods, and the best template for one method can be suboptimal for others. As shown in Zhao et al. (2021); Min et al. (2022a), the prompt format (i.e., a transformation from a set of examples to a natural language input) is also highly important. However, this aspect is often overlooked in most existing studies. Namely, works proposing modifications of ICL frequently present their results for a specific template without specifying the criteria guiding its selection. Furthermore, even when the results are averaged over a set of templates, they are compared to methods that were evaluated on a different set of templates. We illustrate this common discrepancy in Appendix A. This inconsistency can lead to a misinterpretation of the reported results: the difference between the performance of two methods may be explained by the variation across prompt formats rather than the methods themselves. In this work, we evaluate the template sensitivity of 19 models from 7 families, including state-of-the-art open-source models Touvron et al. (2023b); Almazrouei et al. (2023), and show that this issue persists irrespective of the model size and the number of demonstrations. Moreover, comparing various ICL enhancements while taking the template influence into account renders the superiority of one method over others less apparent. Therefore, it is likely that the gains reported for advanced prompting methods can often be attributed to a luckily chosen template. Crucially, there are no universally best templates for a given task. The best performing demonstration format for a fixed evaluation setting (i.e., the dataset, the model, the demonstration set, and the prediction method) does not transfer consistently across models (even within the same family), demonstration sets, or different prediction methods. We find this concerning, as even the best template for a given setting can become produce poor results after slight changes, which makes “tuning” the template a very difficult task. As a first step towards addressing template sensitivity in a practical way, we propose Template Ensembles — a test-time augmentation approach that averages model predictions over several task templates. This method is easy to implement and increases the average performance across templates for multiple prompting methods while reducing the sensitivity of these methods to the template choice. In summary, our contributions are as follows: 1. We conduct a broad evaluation1 of prompt template sensitivity across 19 models and 4 datasets, showing that the performance gains similar to using in-context learning improvements can be achieved solely by selecting a proper template. 2. We show that the choice of the best template depends on a combination of factors and that it is not possible to transfer the best template between models or prompting methods without a negative impact on quality. 3. We propose Template Ensembles as a baseline solution for improving the template robustness for in-context learning. 2Background and Related Work 2.1In-Context Learning An important property of LLMs is their ability to learn new tasks from only a few demonstrations Radford et al. (2019); Brown et al. (2020). This capability, known as in-context learning, forms the focus of our work. We focus on sequence classification, as it is the most widely studied task for understanding and improving ICL performance. Similarly, although instruction-finetuned models Sanh et al. (2022); Wei et al. (2021); Chung et al. (2022) are a popular choice for downstream adaptation in practice, we omit them from our analysis for consistency with prior work. Formally, classifying an input � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � with in-context learning can be described as finding the class � in the space of label tokens 𝒞 that yields a sequence with the highest probability according to a language model. The input sequence consists of demonstration inputs and labels ( � � , � � ) and a test input ( � � ⁢ � ⁢ � ⁢ � , � ) ; to obtain a natural language input, demonstrations are formatted with a template. Each template consists of four components: input and output verbalizers � � ⁢ ( � ) and � � ⁢ ( � , 𝒞 ) that transform ( � � , � � ) into a natural language text, an intra-separator to divide input from output, and an inter-separator to join several demonstrations. Figure 1 shows an example of transforming a set of demonstrations into a context for ICL. 2.2In-Context Learning Analysis Recent work has shown that ICL can perform at levels comparable to finetuning Chowdhery et al. (2022); Hoffmann et al. (2022). Still, in-context learning is known to be highly dependent on the way the model input is formed: a prompt is defined by several components, and altering any of them can lead to unpredictable changes in performance. Template Selection There are multiple ways to construct a template for a task. The most straightforward approach is to use minimal templates ( � � = { � } , � � = { 𝒞 ⁢ [ � ] } ) or universal verbalizers like “input/output”, as done in Wang et al. (2023) and Wei et al. (2023). Another strategy is to create task-specific templates. Jiang et al. (2020) generate paraphrases of templates for the relation extraction task. Authors show the sensitivity of masked language models to the prompt format and propose to ensemble predictions over the best templates. Compared to this method, our approach is task-agnostic and does not require evaluating all templates in advance. Several studies aim to find templates that directly optimize in-context learning performance Shin et al. (2020); Gao et al. (2021). Our work unifies the results of previous research, using the verbalizers proposed by Gao et al. (2021), as well as minimal and universal templates. Choice and Order of Demonstrations The choice of examples for ICL is highly important, as they enable the model to condition on correct input and label distributions for the task Wu et al. (2023); Nguyen and Wong (2023); Min et al. (2022d). Furthermore, the order of examples also significantly affects the results and does not transfer between models even within the same family Lu et al. (2022b); Zhao et al. (2021). In this work, we analyze two recent methods for selecting demonstrations. Wang et al. (2023) propose learning latent concept variables for a task and using them to find examples that can best predict the task concept. We refer to this method as Implicit Topic Models or ITM. In turn, z-ICL Lyu et al. (2023) generates pseudo-demonstrations by retrieving most similar examples to the test sentence from an unlabeled dataset and assigning random labels to retrieved examples. Crucially, both methods are evaluated on single templates that differ across two works. Therefore, it is unclear whether the reported performance gains arise from the methods themselves or from a particular combination of the example selection strategy, the model, and the chosen template. Prediction Methods The standard approach for classification with LLMs is to compute the sequence probability with each of the possible labels and select the label with the highest probability. We refer to this method as Direct further on. Alternatively, one can use more advanced prediction methods that aim to reduce the variance across prompt formats. The Channel prompting technique, proposed in Min et al. (2022b), maximizes � ⁢ ( � | � ) instead of � ⁢ ( � | � ) . The Calibration method Zhao et al. (2021) computes a correction factor based on the deviation of the model’s predictions for a placeholder input from a uniform distribution over labels and applies this factor to test set predictions. However, as we show in Appendix A, these methods are evaluated on their own sets of templates. In this paper, we strive for a more unified view on the robustness of advanced prompting methods and compare their performance across a broader range of templates and models. Prompt and Template Robustness Although the problem of prompt robustness is relatively well-known, until recently, the discussion of template robustness has been limited. Notably, Sclar et al. (2023) present a highly relevant study of prompt format sensitivity, reporting a significant performance variation across formats even for large models or minor template changes. The primary differences of our work are a simpler structure of the template space and a focus on the impact of template sensitivity on the evaluation of ICL modifications. Moreover, several works study prompt robustness in a broader sense by considering models that use natural language instructions Webson and Pavlick (2022); Leidinger et al. (2023); Weber et al. (2023) instead of labeled demonstrations. Recently, Mizrahi et al. (2023) have shown that very similar instructions can lead to drastic differences in task performance for a variety of instruction-tuned models. Although we study a similar issue, we focus on in-context learning and the transfer of best templates between evaluation setups. Still, our findings agree with the results for instruction tuning, which confirms the necessity of language model evaluation that takes prompt design into account. 3Setup & Methodology Model family Parameters (B) GPT-J Wang and Komatsuzaki (2021) 6 GPT-NeoX Black et al.

(2023b) 13, 70 Falcon Almazrouei et al. (2023) 1, 7, 40 Table 1:Language models used in our work. 3.1Models and Data We evaluate the robustness of in-context learning to template selection across a wide range of models on classification tasks. All models used in our work are listed in Table 1: we run experiments on model families frequently used in literature (such as OPT and BLOOM), as well as the latest models with the highest quality (such as LLaMA 2 and Falcon). In preliminary experiments, we observed that the performance of some models in the few-shot regime lags behind their zero-shot results, indicating that the addition of context might, in fact, be more confusing for these models. Consequently, we excluded certain models from further investigation due to the high level of randomness in their behavior and for the sake of computational efficiency. Further details regarding the selection procedure can be found in Appendix B. We experiment with 4 sequence classification datasets: SST-2 Socher et al. (2013), DBPedia ontology classification task Zhang et al. (2015a), AGNews Zhang et al. (2015b), and TREC Question Classification Li and Roth (2002). Although these datasets are frequently used in ICL studies, there is no consensus regarding the templates that should be used for each task. One can construct an input for in-context learning from a set of demonstrations by using a template consisting of four parts, as illustrated in Figure 1. We present all options for verbalizers and separators for each dataset we study in Section 3.1. Any combination of these components results in a valid template. This set of options results in 216 possible prompt formats for SST-2 and 168 for DBPedia, AGNews and TREC. A single evaluation run of all models on 10 random templates in one setup takes 17–48 hours on a single NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU, depending on the dataset. setstackgap S10pt Dataset Input verbalizer Output verbalizer Intra-separator Inter-separator SST-2 “output: {}”, “target: {}”, “label: {}”, Shortstack“input: {}”, “text: {}”, “sentence: {}”, “{}” “emotion: {}”, “sentiment: {}”, “A {} one.” Shortstack“ ”, “n” Shortstack“ ”, “n”, “nn” “It was {}.”, “All in all {}.”, “A {} piece.” DBPedia “output: {}”, “target: {}”, “label: {}”, AGNews “Topic: {}.”, “Subject: {}.”, TREC ‘This is about {}.”, “It is about {}.” Table 2:Possible choices for all components of templates used in our work. 3.2Methods Along with studying the robustness of standard in-context learning to template selection, we consider its improvements proposed in prior work. We consider two main directions of ICL enhancements mentioned in Section 2: example selection and prediction methods. For each setting, we aggregate the results over 3 random seeds for example selection, with 10 random templates used for each seed and report the mean and standard deviation of classification accuracy, unless specified otherwise. As a baseline for demonstration selection, we choose the most straightforward approach of selecting � random examples from the training dataset. Intuitively, selecting more relevant examples for ICL should yield better performance. In addition, we investigate the template sensitivity of two demonstration selection methods described in Section 2.1: ITM and z-ICL. Specifically, we select examples for � ∈ { 2 , 4 } using official implementations of each method . Importantly, ITM requires training a concept model before choosing the examples. For GPT-2 Large, this procedure takes approximately 30 GPU hours on a single NVIDIA A100-80GB. Repeating it for each of the evaluated models would be infeasible, especially given that the largest model has 86 times more parameters than GPT-2 Large. Therefore, we use the checkpoints of the GPT2-Large concept model provided by the authors to select demonstrations for all datasets. Also, we reuse the same set of examples for all models, leveraging authors’ observations that demonstrations chosen with ITM can be transferred between models. As discussed in Section 2, more advanced prediction techniques can improve in-context learning accuracy. Therefore, we compare Direct with Channel Min et al. (2022b) and Calibration Zhao et al. (2021) prompting methods. 4Evaluation 4.1Baseline Results We begin with analyzing the robustness of language models to the template choice in the baseline setup. Specifically, we evaluate models in zero-shot and few-shot settings, selecting 2/4 random demonstrations and using the Direct prediction method. Our results in Table 3 show that even the most advanced models such as Falcon and LLaMA 2 are highly sensitive to the prompt formatting; Appendix C contains the results for the full set of 19 models. This sensitivity makes it harder to observe the increase in ICL performance with the model size or the number of demonstrations, but this trend still persists. However, even the largest models exhibit the standard deviation reaching 35% of their respective scores. To mitigate this lack of robustness, we could remove consistently underperforming prompt formats from our template pool. We analyze the impact of separate template components in Appendix D and find that there are no particular parts (e.g, verbalizers or separators) which could be excluded from evaluation. Furthermore, we observe that a combination of “suboptimal” parts may result in an optimal template.

Standard deviation across 30 runs (10 templates for 3 sets of demonstrations) is in underscript. The report for all models is presented in Appendix C. 4.2Prediction Methods Next, we aim to evaluate the performance of different prediction methods in a unified setting. Ideally, we would like these modifications to reduce the variance across templates, making the model behavior less dependent on the input format. We evaluate Channel and Calibration methods in a 2-shot setting along with the Direct baseline. Refer to caption Figure 2:Comparison of the in-context learning prediction methods in the 2-shot setting. As depicted in Figure 2, both Channel and Calibration exhibit improved performance as compared to Direct. Still, for a range of models and datasets, the range of scores for Direct substantially overlaps with those of both advanced methods. This indicates the existence of templates that reach the best performance with the Direct prediction method. Additionally, Table 10 of Appendix E reveals that despite Calibration yields the highest mean accuracy most often, it is much more susceptible to template choice than Channel. Therefore, there is no discernible pattern to select between these two methods for a given dataset and model pair. 4.3Example Selection Methods Another area of ICL improvements that we evaluate on the matter of template sensitivity is the example selection strategy. We compare ITM and z-ICL methods to Random baseline in 4-shot setting since it was the main evaluation setting in the works proposing these methods. We use Direct prediction method to evaluate the gains of advanced example selection strategies independently from other concurrent modifications. Results in Figure 3 and Table 12 illustrate that when considering template sensitivity issue, advanced example selection methods often perform worse than random choice baseline. ITM method increases the average performance in most cases but still has a remarkably high standard deviation across templates. Examples selected using z-ICL method lead to consistent but poor performance. Refer to caption Figure 3:Comparison of the selection methods in the Direct 4-shot setting. For the evaluation results of other models and datasets please refer to Appendix F. Note that our evaluation setup differs from those in the works proposing these methods. Namely, we use Direct prediction method and sample 10 random templates that might have not included the templates used by authors of ITM and z-ICL. We conclude from this evaluation that a prompt format selection is as important axis of ICL enhancements as the choice of a proper selection or prediction method. However, unlike the other directions for improving ICL, the search space of possible templates is infinite, making exhaustive exploration for each combination of dataset, model and number of examples impractical. Ideally, the best template for one setting would be optimal for others, or at least for similar settings. However, this is not the case. 5Template Transfer Evaluation 5.1Transfer Between Setups We begin with defining what is considered a successful transfer between setups. In order to do so, we evaluate how the quality of models varies across 30 random templates from Section 3.1. The results detailed in Appendix G demonstrate the top-10 template on average yields 0.90 ± 0.04 of the best template score. Therefore, if a prompt format is present in top-10 for both compared setups, we consider this template successfully transferred. To compare sets of the best templates for a pair of settings � , � we employ an Intersection over Union (IoU), also known as a Jaccard similarity coefficient Jaccard (1912), for the top-10 templates: IoU(A,B) = |A ∩B||A ∪B| = |A ∩B||A| + |B| - |A ∩B| Another measure of transferability could be a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient Zar (2005). However, it is vulnerable to the case when the worst templates share similar ranking; it boosts the score, while transfer of efficient templates remains low. We illustrate this issue in Appendix H. 5.2Transfer Between Models Next, we analyze transfer of the best performing templates between models in the baseline setup. Specifically, we collect the results of each model in 2-shot with Direct prediction and Random selection methods for 30 templates. A heatmap of the IoU for the top-10 best templates between 19 models on the DBPedia dataset is presented in Figure 4. For other datasets, please see Appendix I. We observe that the IoU exceeds 0.5 only for few model pairs on all datasets, signifying that generally template transferability between models in the same setup is rather low. This is especially surprising for models within the same family. These observations demonstrate that, given the sensitivity to prompt format, it is inappropriate to compare methods’ performance across models using a single template, since a template that is effective for one model can easily turn out to be one of the worst choices for another model. Refer to caption Figure 4:IoU of top-10 templates for all models in Random 2-shot with Direct prediction method on the DBPedia dataset. 5.3Transfer Between Prediction Methods As discussed in Section 4.2, no prediction method consitently outperforms others across all models and datasets. Therefore, to find an optimal setup for a new ICL improvement, one needs to evaluate every prediction technique in multiple templates. We investigate whether it is possible to find the universally optimal prompt for different methods to reduce the total computational cost. Direct ↔ Direct ↔ Channel ↔ Calibration Channel Calibration SST-2 0.490.17 0.300.11 0.310.08 DBPedia 14 0.540.17 0.470.15 0.450.14 AG News 0.360.11 0.250.13 0.350.14 TREC 0.310.12 0.230.09 0.280.13 Table 4:Intersection-over-Union between different decoding methods averaged over 19 models results obtained in Random 2-shot setup. To answer this question, we calculate the IoU between top 10 performing templates for each method for a fixed set of demonstrations. Results in Table 4, averaged over 19 models display that transfer between prediction methods is substantially low. Consequently, the prompt format sensitivity issue incurs on practitioners the burden of tuning templates for every prediction method they may wish to employ in conjunction with their own approach. 5.4Transfer Between Example Selection Methods Having found that the best performing templates are specific both to a model and a prediction method, we set out to find whether the best formats are transferable at least between demonstration sets in the same setup. Similarly to previous experiments, we calculate IoU for 10 templates yielded the highest scores for every method. Refer to caption Figure 5:IoU of 10 best templates for each example selection method on AG News dataset. Method-N indicates that Method was used to select � examples. Results in Figure 5 illustrate that simply adding several demonstrations, even if they were obtained with the same method, highly disturbs the ranking of the best templates. This justifies the necessity to evaluate example selection methods on a range of templates to avoid misinterpretation of the results. Based on the above, we conclude that the results of evaluation of various ICL improvements without consideration of template sensitivity issue are hardly reliable for several reasons. First, as the best templates do not transfer between models even within the same model family, scoring a method across several models using the same format will inevitably lead to underestimation of the method for all models except the one for which the format was tuned. Next, as there is no transferability between settings, the format selection procedure has to be precisely described and applied for all evaluated settings for a fair comparison. Moreover, a comparison is unfair even for a non-optimized template, as it introduces an element of chance: a randomly selected template might perform well for one setup but poorly for another. To sum up, there are no universally good performing prompt formats. Therefore, the results of different methods evaluation can be reliable only if they are aggregated over several templates or if the best performing template was selected for every setting in the same manner. The former approach requires accounting for variance of the scores and makes comparison less apparent, while the latter is remarkably computationally expensive. 6Template Ensembles Results of Section 5 indicate that finding an optimal template for a given model is insufficient as it cannot be transferred between different prediction methods, demonstration selections, their order and number. At the same time, tuning prompt template for a given setting is extremely computationally expensive. As a first step towards mitigating this issue we propose to ensemble model predictions over several templates. This approach is widely used in machine learning Ho (1995); Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017) for improving generalization and increasing average performance. Formally, the algorithm computes label probabilities across predictions for each of � templates, where � is the ensemble size, and outputs the label with the highest average probability.

Results are averaged over 5 random seeds. We begin with determining the minimal ensemble size that consistently reduces variance while keeping average performance on the same level or higher. We observe that for the majority of models and prediction methods an ensemble achieves the best accuracy when its size reaches 4 or 5 (see example in Figure 6), with further expansion being less effective. We also find empirical evidence that smaller ensembles may demonstrate unstable behavior, with the possibility of a drop in performance if a suboptimal template is randomly sampled. For the sake of uniformity, in Table 5 we report results for ensembles of size 5. Next, we evaluate performance gains introduced by Template Ensemble for different prediction methods. Our findings in Table 5 and Appendix J indicate that ensembles increase the resulting accuracy for all evaluated models and prediction methods. Most importantly, variance is significantly reduced for most models and methods. Therefore, we can conclude that our method allows to preserve an increase in average performance provided by various ICL advancements methods while effectively mitigating the template sensitivity issue. Refer to caption Figure 6:Ensemble size ablation for Falcon 40B 2-shot learning performance on the SST-2 dataset. 7Conclusion In this work, we study the inconsistencies in the evaluation of in-context learning advancements introduced by the template sensitivity of large language models. Specifically, we find that ICL improvements exhibit high variation across template formats and that it is not possible to reuse the same template across different modifications. This aspect is often overlooked in prior work, despite the fact that the impact of template selection on prediction accuracy may be comparable with the choice of demonstrations or prompting methods. While we propose Template Ensembles as an initial solution to this problem, the sensitivity of language models to minor prompt variations is yet to be addressed. Consequently, we believe that the research community should take this problem into account when developing new models, evaluation benchmarks, or in-context learning methods.\\"\\"","completion":"The third paper, \\"Mind Your Format: Towards Consistent Evaluation of In-Context Learning Improvements,\\" focuses on an often overlooked yet crucial aspect of large language models (LLMs), particularly their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities: the prompt template format. The paper highlights how the choice of template can significantly affect a model's performance, potentially reducing it to randomness if poorly chosen. This variation in performance based on template formatting underscores the challenge in comparing different ICL improvement methodologies across various studies, as template selection is not standardized and can lead to misleading comparisons. # Key Takeaways Simplified 1. **The Importance of Template Format:** Just like the way a question is phrased can lead to different answers in a conversation, the format of the template used to prompt a language model can dramatically affect its ability to learn and apply new tasks from a few examples (what's known as in-context learning). 2. **No One-size-fits-all Template:** Finding the \\"best\\" template is tricky because what works well for one model or task might not for another. Even within models of the same family, the optimal template for one scenario can perform poorly in another. This reality makes it hard to \\"tune\\" templates for optimal performance across varied setups. 3. **Template Ensembles as a Solution:** The researchers propose an approach called \\"Template Ensembles,\\" which averages model predictions over several templates as a way to boost average performance and reduce dependency on the choice of a single template. This method aims to mitigate the issue of template sensitivity, making models more robust to the choice of prompt format. # Relating to Our Discussion The findings from this paper add another layer of complexity to the previously discussed papers on SELF-INSTRUCT and the effects of eccentric prompts. Both of these discussions revolved around improving how AI models understand instructions or generate more effective prompts. The third paper brings attention to the fact that even with advanced techniques for generating or optimizing prompts, the fundamental format of these prompts—how information is presented to the model—plays a critical role in the outcome. This insight emphasizes the necessity of considering prompt format variability when assessing the effectiveness of models or new AI training methodologies. In essence, this paper suggests that when we evaluate methodologies like SELF-INSTRUCT or eccentric automatic prompts, the choice of template format can significantly influence the perceived effectiveness of these methods. It calls for a more standardized or comprehensive approach in evaluating AI models' capabilities, where not just the content of the prompts or the methods of generating them are considered, but also how these prompts are formatted and presented to the models. The concept of \\"Template Ensembles\\" can be seen as complementary to efforts like SELF-INSTRUCT, potentially providing a way to assess the robustness of AI models against a broader range of instructional formats. By integrating such an approach, researchers could ensure that the improvements observed in AI models' performance are not just artifacts of optimized prompt formats but reflect genuine advancements in understanding and executing a wide array of tasks. This consistency in evaluation would support clearer comparisons between different models and methodologies, advancing our ability to develop more capable and adaptable AI systems."},{"prompt":"Найти производные dz/dx , dz/dy функции, заданной неявно x^2 - 2y^2 + z^2 - 4x + 2z - 5 = 0 В ответе привести значения производных при x = 2, у = 3 и наименьшем положительном z, соответствующем данным х и у.","completion":"Для нахождения производных dz/dx и dz/dy воспользуемся методом неявного дифференцирования.

جميعا أن يتكلموا بها دون حرج أو مشقة، لأن خصائص تلك اللغة لم تجنح إلى التفريق المبني على العصبية للهجة معينة، ولذلك لا تجد الألسنة صعوبة في النطق بها ولا الأفواه مشقة على التعود عليها . هذا وقد دلت الملاحظة على أنه حين تقوى الصلة بين أفراد الجماعة اللغوية، وتسهل بينهم وسائل الاتصال والارتباط مادية كانت أو ثقافية تتكون لهم مع الزمن لغة مشتركة تقرب بينهم وتعينهم على تفاهم أسرع وأيسر، وتقضي لهم مصالحهم الدنيوية، ثم تصبح بعد ذلك وسيلة للمتعة حين تتخذ للتعبير عن أحاسيسهم وعواطفهم في كل نتاج أدبي جميل \\". وإذن فمفهوم اللغة المشتركة لا يعني مستوى رفيعا من التعبير الفني، ولكنه قدر في متناول أوساط الناس يتعامل مع قدراتهم الثقافية العامة، فهم يفهمونه وإن كان بعضهم لا يحسن استعماله في التعبير عن أفكاره، وقد يكون هذا المستوى مكتوبا يقرؤونه، وقد يكون منطوقا يسمعونه في مجال من المجالات الجادة .. وبناء عليه فقد قالوا في تعريف اللغة المشتركة : هي الصورة اللغوية المثالية التي تفرض نفسها على جميع الأفراد في مجموعة واحدة . والصفة الأساسية في اللغة المشتركة أنها لا تنتمي صفاتها أو عناصرها إلى لهجة محلية بعينها، بمعنى أن الخطيب أو الشاعر أو المتكلم باللغة المشتركة لا يتكلم للهجته المحلية ولا يلحظ المستمع ذلك في كلامه، ومعنى هذا أن اللغة المشتركة ليست لغة قبيلة بعينها، أو بعبارة أخرى أن اللغة المشتركة لا تتضمن شيء من خصائص اللهجات المحلية، فهي لغة منسجمة موحدة لا يمكن أن تنتمي إلى بيئة لغوية خاصة، فمثلا اللغة العربية الفصحى لا تنتمي إلى بيئة لغوية خاصة من بيئات الجزيرة العربية، فلا يحق لنا أن نقول مثلا : إن اللغة العربية الفصحى (اللغة المشتركة هي لغة قريش أو لغة تميم أو غيرها من القبائل العربية، بل هي مريح مأخوذ من كل هذه اللغات، تكونت له شخصيته وأصبح مستقلا عن اللهجات. ولكن يمكن القول بأن لهجة قريش أسهمت بعناصر كثيرة في تكوين اللغة العربية الفصحى (اللغة المشتركة فلا مبالغة إذن في إطلاق لهجة قريش على اللغة العربية الفصحى، إذ اللغات المشتركة تقوم دائما على أساس لغة موجودة

تنتشر في قطر من الأقطار، أو في دولة من الدول أخذت العناصر المشتركة في تكونها في الازدياد . وغالبا ما تكون اللغة المشتركة في أول الأمر لهجة محلية تحظى بقدر من التعظيم والتمجيد، ويعترف بها لغة رسمية للدولة لسبب من الأسباب مثل : أن تكون لهجة منطقة من البلد اتخذت مقرا للحكم مثل : اللغة الفرنسية في الأصل لهجة باريسية تغلبت على اللهجات المحلية الأخرى خرجت من العاصمة، ومن طبقة اجتماعية بعينها من طبقات العاصمة، وهي البرجوازية التي استقرت في القرن السابع عشر، وسلم بها القصر، ثم الأقاليم والكتاب الكبار باستعمالهم إياها، وزودوها بالقدرة على فرض نفسها نهائيا، وعلى استمرارها، لذلك لا نكاد نحس فيها

والتجارة، ولم تكن مكة سوقا للتجارة وموضعا للعبادة فحسب بل كانت أيضا ركزا عظيما للأدب والخطابة، وكان الشعراء والخطباء من كل القبائل والأماكن يأتون إلى مكة يعرضون أشعارهم وخطبهم على الناس بتلك اللغة المشتركة التي يجتمعون على فهمها على الرغم من اختلاف لهجاتهم. واللغة المشتركة تحظى بمكانة عظيمة عند أصحابها يدل على ذلك أنها اللغة التي يعلمونها لمن يريد أن يتعلمها من غير المتكلمين بها، وهي اللغة التي يعدونها مماثلة اللغات الأخرى ومعبرة عن شخصيتهم القومية، كما أنها تقوم بوظائف مهمة متصلة بالشئون العامة لأفراد الشعب، فهي لغة الدولة الرسمية بكل مؤسساتها وهيئاتها المختلفة، وهي أيضا لغة التعليم بكل مراحله ومستوياته، وهي كذلك لغة العلم\\". ولا يغيب عنا أيضا أن اللغة المشتركة قد تتولد عن تغلب إحدى اللغات على لغات أخرى، كما حدث للغة العربية بعد الإسلام، حيث دخلت أماكن كثيرة متعددة اللغات، واستطاعت اللغة العربية في نهاية الأمر أن تقضي على هذه اللغات، وأن تحل محلها، فقد تغلبت على اللغة الآرامية في العراق وبلاد الشام وعلى اللغة القبطية في مصر، وعلى اللغة البربرية \\"الأمازيغية\\" في بلاد المغرب العربي، وعلى الفارسية في مناطق مملكة فارس القديمة عوامل توحد اللهجات في لغة مشتركة من أهم العوامل التي تؤدي إلى توحد اللهجات في لغة مشتركة واحدة ما يلي: 1 - الدين للدين أثر مهم في توحيد اللهجات وصهرها في لغة واحدة، فهو يأسر قلوب الناس، ويدعوهم إلى عبادة الله ويعمل على جمعهم على لغة واحدة يتفاهمون بها، ومن ثم فإن الاجتماعات الدينية، والمناسبات الروحية تفرض على الناس المشاركة والاختلاط والتلاقي والتزاور، كما ترى في مواسم الحج، والجمع، والأعياد الدينية، والصلوات داخل المساجد والموالد والاحتفالات الدينية، وزيارة المساجد الكبرى، أو الملحق بها مزارات لكبار الأئمة والأولياء والصالحين. ٢ - الأدب للأدب فضل كبير في نشر اللغة المشتركة وتنقيتها من صفات اللهجات المحلية، لأن الأدباء (شعراء وكتاب وخطباء يعملون على نشر إنتاجهم الأدبي بين طبقات المجتمع المختلفة، ليشتهروا بين الناس، وترتفع منزلتهم داخل المجتمع، ولا يتحقق لهم ذلك إلا إذا كان إنتاجهم الأدبي منشورا بلغة يفهمها جميع من يطلع عليه، وذلك يتطلب أن يكون بلغة عامة غير متأثرة بلهجة معينة وقد سادت عند العرب جميعا قبل الإسلام اللغة العربية الفصحى كلغة مشتركة، كتبوا بها نثرهم، ونظموا بها أشعارهم، وأقاموا أسواقا أدبية لذلك، كسوق عكاظ، وذي المجاز والمجنة، وكثيرا ما كان يجري التنافس والمباراة بين الشعراء والأدباء في هذه الأسواق، ليحكم لهذا بالتفوق على ذاك، وكانت أشعارهم مصدر إلهام وإمتاع للجماهير العربية، وقد ساعد ذلك على ظهور لغة عربية مشتركة بين العرب جميعا يفهمها الجميع، وتقوم على أساس اللهجة القرشية وما استفادته من ٦٨ محاس اللهجات العربية الأخرى . ٣- العامل السياسي تعد الوحدة السياسية أي نظام الحكم السياسي للأقاليم المختلفة التي تخضع لإدارته من أهم العوامل في توحيد المجتمع لغويا، وتكوين لغة عامة مشتركة بين جميع الأفراد والطبقات داخل أقاليم الدولة؛ لأن هذه الوحدة تؤدي إلى الاختلاط التام بين سكان الأقاليم المتحدة، وهو ما نتج عنه توحيد اللغة والتخلي عن الصفات اللغوية الخاصة باللهجات الإقليمية \\". - وسائل الإعلام الإذاعة والتلفاز والصحافة) لوسائل الإعلام المعاصرة من إذاعة وتلفزيون، وكذالك للمسارح ودور السينما دور مهم في نشر اللغة المشتركة بين الناس وتوحيد اللهجات المختلفة في واحدة، فهذه الوسائل هي المتكلمة بلسان حال الأمة والمعبرة عن أمورهم السياسية والاجتماعية والثقافية، وهذه الوسائل تستخدم لغة وسطي أشبه ما تكون عامة بين الناس فيما يسمع أو يكتب على حد سواء، ففي الدول العربية مثلا تستخدم اللغة العربية الفصحى بعض الأساليب العامية التي يفهمها الجميع، وهذه الوسائل - بلا شك - لها تأثيرها العظيم في الناس وفي تكوين لغة مشتركة . ه - إقامة الأسواق إقامة الأسواق وتأسيس المعارض العامة، وكذلك إقامة المباريات الرياضية المختلفة بين الأندية الرياضية يساعد على اجتماع الناس واختلاطهم مع اختلاف لهجاتهم ومناطقهم، ومن ثم يضطرون إلى التكلم بلغة مشتركة يفهمها جميع الناس تخلو من صفات لهجاتهم المحلية \\". ٦ - ظهور المدن الكبرى المدن الكبرى وبصفة خاصة العواصم لها دور واضح في توحيد اللهجات في واحدة مشتركة، حيث يفد إليها الناس من مختلف الأقاليم، وذلك للإقامة أو قضاء مصالحهم، فيندمج الوافدون إلى تلك المدن مع سكانها الأصليين، وتذهب صفات لهجاتهم المحلية، لأن الجميع يحاولون التكلم بلغة مشتركة مفهومة للجميع. وبعد فهذه أهم العوامل التي تؤدي مجتمعة إلى تكوين لغة مشتركة بين أبناء الأمة، والقضاء على سمات وصفات لهجاتهم المحلية، وهذه العوامل . ن مع غيرها تعمل .. عوامل انقسام اللغة إلى لهجات علينا فيما سبق أن عوامل توحد اللهجات في لغة واحدة تقوم بالأساس على اختلاط أفراد المجتمع واتصالهم ببعضهم، وتخليهم عن صفات لهجاتهم المحلية ليسهل التفاهم وتبادل المصالح والمنافع، والأمر في انقسام اللغة إلى لهجات وتشعبها عكس ذلك تماما، إذ يعود إلى تفرق الناس، وصعوبة الاتصال بين أبناء الأمة الواحدة بسبب ضعف المواصلات، ومشقة السفر والانتقال، والعزلة الاجتماعية. أما العوامل التي إذا ما اجتمعت على اللغة تسببت في انقسامها وتفرعها إلى لهجات فأهمها ما يلي : ۱ - عوامل جغرافية الطبيعة الجغرافية للأرض التي يعيش عليها الإنسان متنوعة ومختلفة، ففيها الجبال والهضاب والسهول والوديان والأراضي الزراعية والصحراء القاحلة، وفيها البحار والأنهار، ومتى اختلفت الطبيعة الجغرافية للأرض فإن ذلك يؤدي حتما إلى اختلاف اللغة وانقسامها إلى لهجات ، فحين تتصور لغة من اللغات وقد اتسعت مساحتها، وفصل بين أجزاء أراضيها بفواصل طبيعية جبال وسهول ووديان وصحاري وأنهار، تستطيع الحكم بإمكان انقسام هذه اللغة الواحدة إلى لهجات مختلفة، لأن هذه العوامل الطبيعية يترتب عليها تكوين بيئات لغوية صغيرة، ثم بمرور الزمن مع عزلة سكان هذه المناطق وصعوبة الاتصال، وقلة احتكاك أبناء الشعب الواحد بعضهم مع ببعض تنقسم لغتهم الواحدة إلى لهجات \\" لها صفاتها الخاصة المطبوعة بطابع البيئة والمكان الذي تمت فيه؛ إذ من المعروف أن سكان هذه البيئات الجغرافية يختلفون أيضا تبعا لاختلاف طبيعاتهم الجغرافية التي يعيشون فيها، كما تختلف احتياجاتهم وأنواعها وبالتالي تختلف طرق التفكير فيها أو التعبير عنها.","completion":"يتناول المتن مفهوم اللغة المشتركة وكيف يتم تكوينها بناءً على التواصل والتعاون بين أفراد المجتمع اللغوي. تشير النصوص إلى أن اللغة المشتركة تستند إلى لغة

يؤثر في انقسام اللغة الواحدة إلى لهجات متعددة، واتصال الشعوب واحتكاكهم ناتج عن أمرين : أ - تبادل المنافع خلقنا الله جل ثناؤه شعوبا وقبائل لتعارف، ولنتبادل المصالح والمنافع فيما بيننا، والمعروف علميا واجتماعيا أن الإنسان بالفطرة اجتماعي، يستحيل عليه أن يعيش منفردا منعزلا عن باقي أفراد جنسه، إذ لا يستطيع أن يستقل بحياته، أو أن يعتمد على نفسه في قضاء ما يحتاج إليه بدون مساعدة غيره من أبناء جنسه. والشعوب البشرية لا يمكن أن تستقل عن بعضها، فلكل شعب له ميزاته وخصائصه، ومن ثم ترى بعض البلاد تشتهر بالتجارة، وأخرى بالصناعة، وثالثة بالزراعة، ونظام الحياة يقضي بأن تستفيد الشعوب من مزايا بعضها، وهذا يوثق الصلات بينهم ليتمكنوا من تبادل المنافع بينهم، وهو ما ينبغي معه أن تعرف كل جماعة بشرية لغة الأخرى وهذا يؤدي إلى احتكاك اللغات، وتغيير في النطق في بعض الأحيان واختلال الكلام يؤدي مع مرور الزمان إلى وجود لهجات متنوعة داخل اللغة الواحدة . ب - الهجرة علينا مما سبق أن أي مجتمع من المجتمعات الإنسانية اللغوية لا يستطيع أن يعيش في عزلة عن المجتمعات اللغوية الأخرى، بل هو يعيش معها، وهو في الوقت نفسه مضطر خضوعا لسنة الحياة أن يخالط هذه المجتمعات، وأن يتصل بها سياسيا وثقافيا واقتصاديا وعلميا. والعلاقة بين المجتمعات المختلفة لا تدوم على حال واحدة، وإنما هي تتقلب بين المحبة والعداوة، والحرب والسلام، ولكل صدام واحتكاك له نتائجه على المجتمعات أهمها بل وأعظمها خطرا النتائج الاجتماعية التي تشمل التأثير في اللغة وانقسامها إلى فحات، ومعنى ذلك أن الاحتكاك بين المجتمعات الإنسانية أمر ضروري لا مفر مه، مما

essentially comes down to the bridge design and how the tremolo system is mounted to the body of the guitar. These systems allow the guitar player to manipulate the bridge with a tremolo arm (whammy bar), creating vibrato effects. Here are the main differences between the two: # 6-point Tremolo System 1. **Design and Mounting**: In a 6-point (or vintage-style) tremolo system, the bridge is attached to the guitar body using six screws that run along the front edge of the bridge plate. This design is traditional and was famously used on early Fender Stratocasters. 2. **Stability and Responsiveness**: The 6-point tremolo is often considered to give a more \\"vintage\\" feel and tone. However, because it pivots on six screws, it can sometimes be less stable in terms of tuning stability, particularly if the system is used heavily. That said, many players feel that this system offers a certain warmth and character. 3. **Adjustability**: While offering a classic feel and experience, the 6-point system can be less forgiving and might require more maintenance and fine-tuning to keep it functioning optimally, especially regarding intonation and tremolo action. # 2-point Tremolo System 1. **Design and Mounting**: The 2-point tremolo system, which is a more modern innovation, mounts to the guitar body using two pivot points, usually two studs or posts. This allows the bridge to \\"float\\" and pivot with less friction than the 6-point design. 2. **Stability and Responsiveness**: Thanks to the reduction in friction, the 2-point tremolo tends to offer superior tuning stability and a smoother vibrato effect. Players can use the whammy bar more aggressively with fewer concerns about detuning. This design is found in more modern Stratocasters and many other modern guitars. 3. **Adjustability**: The 2-point system generally allows for easier and more precise adjustments, both in terms of action and intonation. This can make the guitar more user-friendly, especially for players who like to use the tremolo arm extensively. # Conclusion The choice between a 6-point and a 2-point tremolo system often comes down to personal preference. Some players prefer the classic feel and tonal characteristics of a 6-point tremolo, while others prioritize the tuning stability, ease of use, and responsiveness of a 2-point system. Both systems have their merits and can be found on high-quality instruments across various price points."},{"prompt":"What Was Walt Disney World Like On 9/11?","completion":"On September 11, 2001, the United States faced an unprecedented terrorist attack. On that day, hijackers took control of four commercial airplanes, crashing two into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, another into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and the fourth, United Flight 93, crashed into a field in Pennsylvania after passengers and crew tried to regain control from the hijackers. This tragic event had a profound effect across the United States, including at Walt Disney World in Florida. Walt Disney World, known for being \\"The Most Magical Place on Earth,\\" experienced a day unlike any other on September 11, 2001. Here's what happened: # Immediate Response - **Early Park Closure**: Walt Disney World made the decisive action to close all of its parks. This was a significant measure as the parks rarely close, with only a handful of exceptions in its history up to that point. - **Guest Notification**: Guests in the parks were informed of the closures in a respectful and orderly manner. The announcements did not specify the reason for closure to avoid panic but mentioned it was due to a national emergency. - **Security Measures**: Security was heightened immediately. Disney has a comprehensive security protocol in place, and this was fully activated to ensure the safety of guests and cast members. # Guest and Cast Member Care - **Hotel Guests**: For those staying in Disney hotels, provisions were made to ensure their comfort and safety. The resort kept its hotel guests informed via in-room television messages and offered extended accommodations for those unable to leave due to flight restrictions. - **Calm and Order**: Reports from guests and cast members alike spoke of an atmosphere of calm and care taken by the staff to ensure that everyone was safe and well-informed without causing panic. # Commemoration and Reflection - **Flags at Half-Staff**: In the days following, flags were flown at half-staff throughout Walt Disney World, as across the United States, in commemoration of the lives lost. - **Moments of Silence and Reflection**: The parks and resorts held moments of silence and reflection for the victims of the attacks. # Theme Park Industry Impact - **Security Enhancements**: The 9/11 attacks led to immediate and lasting changes in security measures not only at Walt Disney World but across the entire theme park industry. Bag checks, metal detectors, and other security measures were intensified or introduced where they hadn't been before. # Aftermath Walt Disney World resumed operations on September 12, 2001, with heightened security measures in place. The attacks of 9/11 left a profound impact on the United States and the world, prompting changes in many facets of daily life and operations, including at major destinations like Disney parks. The company's response showcased their commitment to guest safety while maintaining the magic and escapism that many seek in visiting Disney parks.

-미국을 어떻게 3:0으로 이기냐 ㅡㅡ; 설레발 자제 좀요 영국전을 제외하곤, 결승전까지 3:0으로 압승을 거두며 올라온 한국 대표팀. 하지만, 결승전 상대 미국은 차원이 다른 강적이었다. -애초에 배틀넷의 인터페이스랑 언어 자체가 미국 때문에 영어잖음 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ -인도까지야 성지한 출전 안 해도 이겼지만, 미국은……. -우리 서포터진의 희망 소피아도 미국에서 밀려 가지고 온 거 아닌가요 -ㄴㄴ 레벨이 딸려서 못 들어간 거임. 미국 서포터진에 들어갔으면 TOP3엔 들어갔을 거임. -TOP3…… 미국은 소피아급 서포터가 일단 3명 이상이란 이야기네 ㄷㄷ 4강전에서 중국을 3:1로 꺾고 온 미국. 객관적인 전력은 그들이 한국을 크게 압도하고 있었다. 그나마 한국이 비빌 만한 것이라는 검왕이 있는 전사진과, 윤세아가 합류하며 더욱 강해진 궁수진뿐. 그리고 이 두 클래스도 상대해 볼 만하단 거지, 미국을 이길 수 있단 이야기는 아니었다. 전사, 궁수는 동등이라 쳐도. 마법사, 서포터 클래스 쪽은 압도적 열세를 보였으니. 배틀넷 전문가들은 한국이 분전할지는 몰라도. 결국엔 미국이 이길 거라고 모두가 예측하고 있었다. 다만 결승전의 변수라면. -만약 성지한이 밴만 안 당하면……. -우리가 이길 수도 있어. 단연, 성지한이었다. 바로 전에 치러졌던 길드 미션에서, 현 인류의 랭커와 현격한 차이가 있음을 보여 주었던 성지한. 그는 일단 출전만 하면 게임을 폭파시키는 치트키였다. -1, 2경기에서 한 게임만 건지고, 3, 4, 5경기에서 성지한 밴이 두 번만 풀리면 우승이다. -아, 근데 이번에 너무 밴 잘 당하던데 ㅡㅡ 성지한 출전한 게임이 한 게임이야. 인도전 3경기. -그게 다 결승전을 위해 스택 적립한 거임. -ㄹㅇ 이제 귀신같이 밴 피하고 결승전 MVP 되실 예정임 ㅋㅋㅋ 4강전까지는 한 번밖에 출전하지 못한 성지한이었지만. 그러니까 오히려 액땜한 거 아니냐고, 한국 팬들은 희망회로를 돌리고 있었다. 물론 미국 팬들은 이와는 정반대로. -성…… 이번 토너먼트에서는 운이 없는 거 같아. 그의 불운을, 내일까지만 기원하도록 하지. -맞아. 내일 후론 그는 불운해서는 안 돼. 세계수 엘프와의 일전도 남겨 두고 있다고. -1, 2경기 이기고 밴 1번만 당해도 미국의 승리다. -성을 제외하고도 한국은 강팀이 맞지만, 그래도 우릴 이길 순 없지. 성지한의 불운이, 내일 결승전까지만 지속되기를 원했다. “와, 미국…… 세도 너무 세다.” 배틀넷 센터의 전력 분석실. 윤세아는 미국과 중국의 4강전 경기를 보면서 한숨을 쉬었다. 미리 보는 결승전이라고 세간에서 평가했을 정도로 화제를 불러 모았던 이 경기는. 미국과 중국이 서로 숨겨 놓았던 카드를 모두 꺼내 들고, 자신들이 지닌 전략 전술을 총동원해서 명승부를 연출해 낸 경기였다. 한데 이 게임의 스코어는 3:1이었지만. 여기서 보이는 전력 차이는, 이 점수보다도 꽤 큰 차이가 났다. “2경기는 미국이 좀 방심해서 진 거네.” “맞아. 마법사 배런이 결정적 실수를 했어. 그가 아니었다면 3:0으로 미국이 중국을 압도했을 거야.” “배런 아저씨는 상태창 2개를 지니고 있으면서 왜 저런대…… 언제 발컨에서 벗어날까?” “평생 저럴 거다.” 옆에서 성지한이 리플레이를 힐끗 보더니, 그리 단언했다. 중요 경기에서 새가슴이 되는 건, 배런의 전매특허였지. “안 되겠다. 삼촌이 이번에 결승전에 꼭 나와 줘야겠어.” “밴만 풀리면 얼마든지 끝을 내주겠다만. 결승전에서의 운은 어떨지 모르겠네.” “이제는 좀 풀릴 때도 됐지! 한 게임은 우리가 이길 게. 두 경기 잡아 줘!” “그래, 기대하마.” 성지한은 고개를 끄덕이며, 허공을 바라보았다. 그 모습은, 마치 시스템 메시지를 보는 느낌이라. 전력 분석실에서 미국 선수들의 활약상을 같이 지켜보던 윤세진이 성지한에게 질문했다. “처남, 그런데 뭐 보고 있나? 혹시 또 퀘스트 같은 거라도 뜬 건가?” “아, 배틀넷 마켓 좀 뒤지고 있었습니다.” “마켓? 삼촌 무슨 물건 찾아?” “알고 보니 이종족이 마켓에 자기 수련 영상을 올린 게 있더라.” 성지한은 그러며, 며칠 전의 일을 떠올렸다. * * * 클래스 이종무해. 이걸 전직하고 딱히 써먹어 본 적이 없었던 성지한은, 저번에 만귀봉신을 통해 이 효과를 제대로 맛본 후. 더 활용할 방법이 없나 고민하고 있었다. 그때. -이종족의 경험…… 주인, 배틀넷 마켓에 뒤져 보는 게 어떻겠나? 최근 오랫동안 성지한의 팔 안에서 침묵을 지키고 있던 아리엘이, 그에게 방법을 알려 주었다. -마켓에 그런 것도 팔아? -영상구로 검색하면 별게 다 나온다. 뭐 사실, 쓸모없는 자료가 대부분이긴 하지만…… 이종족이 어떻게 힘을 쓰는지가 궁금하면 어느 정도 간접 체험은 될 거다. 그리하여 검색해 본 배틀넷 마켓의 ‘영상구‘. 아리엘 말대로, 그 키워드로 검색된 것에는 별의별 영상이 다 있었다. “아하, 삼촌이 그래서 요즘 자꾸 허공만 바라봤구나. 이종족 수련 영상…… 도움 돼?” “일단 마켓에 돌아다니는 영상구 중 95퍼센트는 쓰레기야. 그중 반 이상이 이종족 교미 장면이지.” “교, 교미?” “어. 이 이종족 놈들은 왜 자기들 생식 장면을 마켓에 뿌리는지 모르겠군. 거기에 알 낳는 건 뭐 이리 많은지…….” 성지한은 그간 폐기했던 영상구들을 떠올리며, 미간을 찌푸렸다. 이종족이 힘을 사용하는 방식을 알려고 했는데, 어째 나오는 건 대부분 영양가가 없었다. 우주에 이렇게 변태가 많았나. “1GP짜리 영상구는 백프로 그런 류였지.” “그, 그렇구나? 그럼…… 나머지 5퍼센트는?” “그건 좀 쓸모 있었어.” 이종족의 수련 영상. 그것은 성지한에게, 진흙 속의 진주 같은 존재였다. 비록 마켓에 뿌린 영상이니만큼, 대부분이 수박 겉핥기식이고 심도 있는 수련 방식은 나오지 않았지만. ‘이종족이 힘을 사용하는 거 자체가 신선한 자극이었지.’ 밴으로 인해 경기에 출전하지 못하고, 계속 대기 상태였던 성지한은. 그렇게 마켓을 뒤적거리면서, 클래스 이종무해를 써먹었다. “수련 영상. 내가 봐도 도움이 되려나?” “글세, 나는 클래스 효과 때문에 도움이 되었지만, 일반 사람들은 전혀 도움이 안 될 거야. 날개를 움직이는 감각이나, 자기 꼬리를 떼고 도망가는 느낌…… 이런 게 일반 플레이어에겐 별 영감을 주지 못할 테니까.” “아, 그런 종류구나…….” “궁금하면 하나 보여 주고.” “응, 하나 봐 보자.” “처남, 나도 볼 수 있겠나?” 성지한은 고개를 끄덕이며, 인벤토리에서 이종족의 수련 영상구를 꺼내 둘에게 넘겨주었다. “어떻게 재생하는 거야?” “만진 상태에서 플레이라고 이야기하면 가상현실처럼 나와.” “오…… 역시 배틀넷의 신문물.” 겉으로 보기엔 마법사의 수정구슬 같은 그 물건을 만진 채, 플레이를 외치는 두 부녀. “……더 멀리 나는 법? 뭐야, 등을 어떻게 움직이는 거야, 얘네.” “입에서 불을 만드는 종족의 경험 같은 건 전혀 써먹을 곳이 없어 보이는군…….” 둘은 곧, 영상을 재생해 보고는 전혀 이해하질 못하겠다며 이를 성지한에게 다시 건네주었다. 둘은 각자 워리어와 아처 클래스에서 거의 정점에 다다른 플레이어였지만. 그런 이들도 영상구에서 얻어 갈 건 없어 보였다. ‘이종무해가 없으면 역시 이건 쓸모없는가. 하긴, 이종족 다큐멘터리를 VR로 보는 거나 마찬가지니.’ 일반 플레이어에게야, 영상구 구매는 허공에 돈을 날리는 행위. 하나 이종무해를 지닌 성지한에게는, 이는 매우 쏠쏠한 효과를 나타내고 있었다. ‘이번에 영상 봐서 오른 무혼이 벌써 5다.’ 밴당해서 벤치에서 영상구를 재생한 것치고는 상당했던 스탯 상승. 성지한은 그렇게 시간 여유가 있을 때마다 이종족 영상구를 재생하기로 마음먹으며. 배틀넷 마켓을 뒤지고 있었다. 그때. “처남, 잠깐 밖에서 이야기 좀 할 수 있겠나?” 전력 분석실에 같이 있던 윤세진이, 성지한에게 위로 손짓을 했다. 옥상에 가자는 제스처. 성지한은 배틀넷 마켓 창을 끄고는, 고개를 끄덕였다. “그러죠.” * * * 배틀넷 센터 옥상. “날이 좋군.” 윤세진은 그렇게 이야기를 꺼내며, 하늘을 바라보았다. ‘금빛이 짙어지는군.’ 토너먼트가 진행되면서, 조금씩 색이 진해졌던 윤세진의 황금 안광. 그 빛은, 지금 이 순간 가장 강렬하게 빛이 나고 있었다. “성좌께서, 도움이 되었냐고 자네에게 물어보라 하셨네.” “결승까지 온 것은 매형의 덕이 컸지요. 도움이 상당히 되었다고 전해 주십시오.” “그런가. 다행이군, 그럼…….” 번쩍! 윤세진의 눈에서 빛이 터져 나오더니. 황금의 보호막이 형성되며, 두 사람과 외부의 공간을 격리했다. “도움을 주었으니, 한 가지 질문을 좀 해도 되겠는가.” “길가메시인가.” “그렇다.” “뭐가 궁금한데?” “네 퀘스트 보상, 뭐지?” 기껏 강림해서 물어보는 게 퀘스트 보상인가? 성지한은 피식 웃으며 대꾸했다. “그런 사소한 거에 관심이 있는 줄은 몰랐군.” “같은 종족 내의 경기 우승 가지고, 퀘스트가 나왔단 이야기는 들은 적이 없었다.” “그래? 난 주던데.” “그래서, 퀘스트 보상이 무엇이냐? 아니, 무얼 받아도 상관없다. 다만.” 윤세진의 몸에 강림한 길가메시는 본론을 꺼냈다. “혹여나, 그 보상으로 성좌 후보자가 확정되는 거라면…… 지금 당장 클리어하지 않는 걸 추천하지.” “왜지? 너, 나보고 변수로 남아 있으라 하지 않았나.” 어떻게 알았는지는 모르겠지만, 퀘스트 보상에 대해서 눈치챈 것 같은 길가메시. 성지한은 어설프게 이를 부인하기보다는. -나는, 네가 계속 변수로 남아 있길 바란다. -네가 성좌 후보자가 되기 전까지, 무신은 손해를 감수하고서라도 널 계속 노릴 거다. 예전에 그가 자신에게 해 주었던 말을 떠올리며, 그에게 반문했다. “내가 성좌 후보자가 되면, 네가 원하는 대로 난 ‘변수’가 되어 있을 텐데?” “그렇지…… 하나, 일에는 순서가 있는 법. 너는 성좌 후보가 되기 전에 롱기누스의 손에서 살아남아야 한다. 그를 이겨 내야 한다. 그래야 네가 진정한 변수가 될 수 있다. ‘세 번째’를 깨울 수 있다.” 그러며 길가메시는 성지한에게 강렬한 안광을 발했다. “무신을 극복하기 위해선, 이 방법뿐이다. 인류를 위해서라도 너는, 그리고 우리는 계획된 순서를 따라야 한다. 아이야, 나의 충고를 가슴에 새기거라. 나의 말을 따르거라.” 그렇게 길가메시가 성지한을 ‘아이’라고 지칭했을 때. 성지한은 자신도 모르게 고개를 끄덕이며, 그의 의지에 순응할 뻔했다. ‘인간’이라면, 당연히 들어야 할 것만 같은 길가메시의 말. 하나 체내의 무혼이 반항하듯이 꿈틀거리며. 지금까지 체험했던, 이종족의 경험이 떠오르자. “인류를 위해서라…… 대의는 거창하군.” 성지한은 인간에게 절대적인 ‘왕의 명령’에 반항할 수 있었다. “하지만 날 납득시키지 않는다면, 그 말은 따를 수 없다.” 그리고 그 모습을 본 길가메시는 놀란 듯 눈을 살짝 크게 뜨더니. “……호오. 나의 말을 완벽하게 거역하다니. 좋아. 그래야 ‘변수’가 될 법하지.” 오히려 기꺼운 듯이 웃었다. 그러면서도. “그래도 이번 일탈은 막아야겠구나…… 네게 이번 우승은 허락하지 않겠다.” 그는 마지막까지 명령조로 말했다. * * * 그리고 다음 날. =드디어 1경기 밴, 셀렉트 시작합니다……! =어…… 미국에서, 성지한 선수를 밴하지 않습니다……. 결승전 1경기부터, 이변이 발생했다. Text 300: The World Champions League group stage matches began in earnest. The games proceeded smoothly. [England match, 3:1 victory! South Korea's national team ends the game in 4 matches] [Saudi Arabia match, 3:0 complete victory! Supporter Sophia reveals her true value on the Supporter map.] [Canada match also 3:0, no upsets.] The Northeast Asia League, known as the most difficult in the world. The Korean national team, who came through as 1st place, found the main event group stage matches much easier in comparison. \\"This is easier than the regional league.\\" \\"Back then, not only were the opposing countries strong, constellations kept popping out, it was no joke.\\" \\"Right. This time, it's very comfortable.\\" Even when facing Taiwan, the lowest ranked in Northeast Asia, they had been troubled by Dongbang Sak's avatar appearing. The national team players felt at ease advancing to the main event. And on top of that. \\"Even if the Supporter map comes out, we won't be pushed back since we have Sophia-nim.\\" \\"Wasn't the Saudi Supporter ranked in the top 5 for Supporters? It's amazing to beat that person with buffs.\\" \\"The buff effect was tremendous.\\" The newly added force, Supporter Sophia. Although it was just one person added, she greatly contributed to raising the power of the Korean national team. Originally, if the Supporter power was strengthened like this with just one addition. The opposing country could ban that player to halve this power-up effect. But Korea had a player that must be banned unconditionally, Seong Jihan. \\"Since player Seong Jihan keeps getting banned, the other players are doing great.\\" \\"But it's not like they can not ban player Seong Jihan either.\\" \\"Our country seems to have really gotten stronger.\\" \\"As long as we don't get sniped with a Mage map like against England, I think we can really win the championship this time?\\" The Korean national team, who only suffered 1 loss against England in the 3 group stage matches. That was the result of a Mage-only map being selected and Seong Jihan being banned. England proved the only way to deal with Korea through this match. But this was only possible if Seong Jihan was banned and the map selection aligned. It was a victory formula that relied heavily on probability. However, there was one thing that bothered even the triumphant national team. [Seong Jihan, who hasn't played even once, will he be able to break through the 50% probability in the tournament?] [The probability of being banned 4 times in a row at 50%? 6.25%. It's about time he gets through at least once!] The ban that opposing countries cast on Seong Jihan as if it was natural. It was hitting the mark too well. -I wanted to see Seong Jihan-nim sweep the opponents, but he keeps sitting on the bench -It's rather good, The group stage opponents are all weak anyway so it's fine, get banned here and have the ban lifted in the tournament -But it's an independent trial anyway. There's no guarantee he won't get banned again -Well, except for maybe the US and China, even if Seong Jihan is banned, it seems manageable... With Yoon Sejin, Yoon Seah, and Sophia added, there's a key player in each position. -Sophia joining the national team was a masterstroke. But perhaps because they won the group stage completely. People didn't take this phenomenon too seriously. The probability of 50% hitting 4 times in a row was rare, but it definitely existed. Rather, Korean fans were encouraged by the national team's power that had become even stronger despite Seong Jihan being banned. \\"There's a lot of praise for Sophia. You should have come to Korea earlier.\\" \\"I wanted to come~ But it's fun. The national team too. It's a bit disappointing not being able to play with Jihan though...\\" \\"Uncle is really good at getting banned. Does 50% probability hit this well?\\" In a waiting room at the BattleNet Center. Seong Jihan and his group were resting there, discussing the recent 3 matches. \\"Still, brother-in-law, you'll get through in the tournament, right? You won't keep getting banned forever.\\" \\"Even if I keep getting banned, Korea's power is now reliable so it's fine. Let's freeload to the championship.\\" \\"Eek, but it seems difficult to beat the US or China without Uncle...\\" \\"That's right. And you have to win to clear the quest, right? Jihan has to play no matter what.\\" In the waiting room with only Seong Jihan's family and Sophia. Sophia, thinking everyone here was trustworthy, brought up the quest Seong Jihan received. Then Yoon Sejin, his eyes sparkling with interest. \\"Quest?\\" \\"Ah, you didn't know?\\" \\"Dad wasn't there at that time.\\" \\"Yeah, I didn't know. Brother-in-law, was that the 'situation' you had to win for?\\" He asked Seong Jihan curiously. Outwardly, it seemed like a simple question from family. But. 'The light is shining again.' Seong Jihan once again spotted a golden light in Yoon Sejin's eyes. A subtle golden light that others wouldn't notice. \\"Yes, but, Your eyes are emitting a golden light.\\" He openly talked about this. \\"What? A golden light from my eyes?\\" \\"Yes, how is your constellation these days? Did you do well with the task ordered by the 'King of Humans'? That light is very similar to that constellation's.\\" \\"Is that so? Strange. I couldn't feel it at all. Where is it?\\" At Seong Jihan's words, Yoon Sejin looked at the mirror in the waiting room. He tilted his head and widened his eyes as if he was really puzzled. \\"Can't you see it with your eyes either, brother-in-law?\\" \\"That's right... Well, since the gap with you is so huge, you can probably see what I can't.\\" \\"......\\" \\"I couldn't carry out the task given to me by the constellation well.\\" \\"Is that so.\\" \\"They told me to find an artifact from the ancient times, and gave me a rough location, but it was like finding a needle in a sand beach. I came back this time because of the national team schedule. I'll have to go again after this is over.\\" As if he couldn't find the golden light no matter how much he looked, Yoon Sejin turned his head away from the mirror. And somehow, he had a satisfied smile on his lips. \\"I can't see it in my eyes, but it's good that the constellation's golden light is shining on me...\\" \\"Is that good?\\" \\"Of course it's good! Doesn't it mean the power of the great 'The King of Humans is dwelling in me? I should strive to receive more power by following his orders.\\" \\"...Dad. Is the constellation that great to you? It's like believing in a god.\\" \\"God? The King of Humans is a being greater than gods. If I devote myself to the constellation, I can even rescue your mother.\\" \\"Even Mom?\\" \\"Yes. The constellation said if I faithfully carry out the given mission, they will solve this matter too.\\" No, even when he first received a sponsoring constellation, he didn't show this kind of reaction. Seong Jihan frowned. 'This somehow reminds me of when he was obsessed with Shizuru before.' Although not obsessed with a woman like back then, Yoon Sejin was now starting to show religious faith in the constellation. Yoon Seah, seeing that, seemed to recall past memories. She watched Yoon Sejin with a gloomy expression. \\"Hmm... It reminds me of the Shizuru incident from before.\\" \\"What, how can you compare Shizuru with the constellation! Shizuru simply brainwashed and used me, while the constellation showed me the way!\\" Yoon Sejin raised his voice at Yoon Seah's words. \\"Ah, okay. Dad. Why are you getting excited?\\" \\"Ah, hmm... I'm sorry, Seah. I got worked up suddenly. I didn't mean to...\\" \\"Hey, it can... happen, you know?\\" \\"...I'll go get some fresh air.\\" As if startled by his own words, he apologized to Yoon Seah and left the room. \\"...What's up with Dad?\\" \\"That, the Sword King's constellation is the King of Humans, right?\\" \\"Yeah, that's right.\\" \\"I heard players who have the King of Humans as their constellation have quite a strong faith. Some even build temples, saying the King of Humans is the savior.\\" \\"...Temples?\\" \\"Well, players have a lot of money. They were building these huge mud towers.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes, here...\\" Swish. Swish. Sophia searched the US players' SNS and showed it to Seong Jihan. Top rankers solemnly bowing in front of huge mud towers they built. Among them were several players who participated in the previous guild battle. [Pay respects to the savior of humanity, the constellation 'King of Humans'. All of humanity is indebted to him. Worship him and show the savior the minimum courtesy.] -What the heck... -Has Louis gone crazy? -No, why is the man who broke crosses saying there are no gods doing this? -Once someone like that falls into a cult, it's even harder for them to get out :( -Who the heck is the King of Humans? There are quite a few players like that. Louis, a top ranker from the US. He was famous for being a troublemaker, posting photos of drinking, gambling, and inappropriate sexual photos with top stars on his SNS. But since having a constellation, he had practically converted to a religious person. \\"This guy has become a decent person.\\" \\"That's true, but isn't it scarier that he's doing something he didn't do before?\\" \\"Right. Eek, will Dad... end up like that later?\\" Just a few years ago, he was the most proud father in the world. Now, worried about what trouble he'll cause, Yoon Seah's forehead wrinkled. Seong Jihan saw that and went outside. It was to check on Yoon Sejin's condition again. However. \\"Brother-in-law, you came out.\\" \\"Are you alright?\\" \\"I'm fine. I made you worry for nothing.\\" Yoon Sejin bowed his head slightly to Seong Jihan with a composed face. Then he soon spoke with a joyful expression. \\"The constellation gave me a message. The constellation said they will always fully support you.\\" \\"...Is that so?\\" \\"Yes. To do this, the constellation gave me something.\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"A class.\\" Yoon Sejin opened his status window and showed the class section to Seong Jihan. \\"...This is.\\" \\"Yes. The constellation eliminated the Korean team's weakness.\\" In his class section. 'Mage' was added. * * * A tight tournament schedule due to the Space League. =The round of 16 opponent has been decided as Germany! =Because of the Space League, the match is held again after only 2 days of rest! =I'm worried if our country's players will be okay physically. =The 1st match begins. Once again, player Seong Jihan is banned. In the tournament where Seong Jihan was banned. The player who received the most attention was none other than Yoon Sejin. Of course, this was partly due to the Sword King's power. =Ah...! The Mage map is selected. =Then the 1st match will be a bit difficult...! =Huh. But. Player Yoon Sejin is... participating? =What? This, this is a Mage map, you know? But more than that, the sight of the Sword King participating in the Mage class map brought even greater surprise to the viewers. -What the? -The Sword King was a Magic Swordsman... -No, but even if a warrior is summoned, the distance between the two towers is far... -?? What nonsense are you saying. The Sword King rides his sword and flies around - You're a game noob, The game is set from the moment the Sword King is summoned. The Mage map, Korea's only weakness when Seong Jihan was banned. This strategy, the only way Germany could lean on Korea. The Sword King who suddenly appeared completely trampled on it. =The, the Sword King! He slaughters all the Mages! =And he's gotten even faster than before! His skills have improved by leaps and bounds! =The German staff, they have a dumbfounded expression! They had to take the 1st match no matter what, but they don't know how to deal with the Sword King who suddenly appeared! =We can't believe it either, how would they feel! The Korean national team whose weakness disappeared. Naturally, the result of the round of 16 match was also 3:0. And such game results continued. =Ah, player Sword King. He even overpowers player Massid! =The match against Argentina is also 3:0...! =He easily crushes the quarterfinals too. Except for the 1 loss against England, he hasn't lost even once! Quarterfinals against Argentina 3:0. =Player Seong Jihan! He finally plays in the 3rd match of the semifinals! It's his first appearance in this Champions League! =Ah, as soon as he appears, the Indian players' base is blown up...! =The Indian players lose the will to resist the overwhelming force... Semifinals against India 3:0. As the Sword King obtained the Mage class, the one-sided game flow continued until the finals. And. =The finals opponent is the US...! =We meet last year's defending champion in the finals! The World Champions League, now only the last match remained. Only the US match was left. Text 299: The World Champions League. For Seong Jihan, this tournament was actually not very meaningful. After all, his main focus was on humanity's ranking in the Space League. And to prepare for the clash with Longinus, he had to put effort into training every day. Seong Jihan had planned to leave the Champions League group stage matches to other Korean players. 'Then when the timing was right, I was going to just sit there and use up my ban cards...' However, due to the quest he received this time, Seong Jihan's view of the World Champions League completely changed. 'The matter about the constellation candidate, it was Pythia's suggestion.' Saying it was to save Seong Jihan's life, Pythia had informed him of the 'Chasing the Stars' option that could make him a constellation candidate. The gap between humanity's 1st place Seong Jihan and 2nd place was still huge, so the Chasing the Stars option remained in effect. At this rate, with time, Seong Jihan would be able to become a constellation candidate. Especially by the time the Champions League winner was decided, the deadline for becoming a constellation candidate would also arrive. Even without the Celestial Cube's quest, there wasn't much time difference anyway until he became a constellation candidate. However. 'Still, it's significant that they're giving this as a reward.' If the Celestial Cube really gave rewards suitable for the user's situation, it could be inferred that advancing the constellation candidacy by a month or two was very important. 'Hmm... Could it be that Longinus's descent is not far off?' The constellation Longinus, wielding the Spear of Judgement. No matter how powerful Seong Jihan had become, if a constellation directly descended, the scales would inevitably tip in their favor. Perhaps the Celestial Cube's reward was to prevent this. 'For now, I must win no matter what.' Even to become a constellation candidate, Seong Jihan decided to take the World Champions League seriously. \\"What should we do for Korea to surely win?\\" As people gathered one by one and Seong Jihan brought up the topic while watching TV, \\"Oh, Uncle seemed uninterested... But your heart is pounding after seeing the group draw, right?\\" \\"According to experts' evaluations, the most important thing against our country is luck. Whether player Seong Jihan gets banned or not has a decisive impact on the match.\\" \\"1st and 2nd bans are mandatory, and from the 3rd it's a 50% chance... If we're really unlucky, the owner could get banned all 5 matches.\\" \\"And they'll definitely pick the Supporter map too. Even though Uncle showed Supporter prowess last time, without Uncle, our country's Supporter power is lacking after all.\\" \\"England, whose Supporter power is similar to ours, is said to only bring out the Mage map. After all, Mage and Supporter are our country's weaknesses.\\" Everyone chimed in about the Champions League. The strategies other countries were preparing against Korea largely fell into two categories. The first was banning Seong Jihan. The second was selecting the Supporter or Mage maps. \\"Then we should recruit talented Mages and Supporters from Korea.\\" \\"That's... right? But finding players with national team-level skills isn't so easy...\\" As Lee Hayeon trailed off, \\"Me, me!\\" Sophia, who brought her plate from the kitchen, raised her hand high. \\"National team-level player! Supporter, lacking in Korea! Here I am!\\" \\"Ah...\\" \\"Well, we do have Sophia-nim as a Supporter.\\" \\"But didn't the US national team call up Sophia? If she's on the roster, she can't play for both, right?\\" \\"Ah, my level is still lacking so I wasn't called. The US national team has a very high level requirement.\\" The US national team, composed of only the world's best players. To be selected as a national representative there, no matter how good one's gift was, they had to surpass the level limit set by the national team. In Sophia's case, she fell slightly short of that, so she couldn't make it into the US national team lineup. \\"But Jihan kept saying why bother naturalizing...\\" \\"That was because of the Sword King's case.\\" Perhaps because of the case of the Sword King, who went to Japan last year and dealt great damage to the Korean national team, Seong Jihan did not welcome foreign players going out of their way to naturalize and come over. In the first place, at this time when the Space League was most important, he felt there was no need to go that far for a national competition. Until now, Seong Jihan had not agreed with Sophia's naturalization either, but now the situation was different. \\"Sophia, want to come? To Korea.\\" \\"Re, really?\\" \\"Yes, we must win this time.\\" \\"Wow!\\" Perhaps surprised that Seong Jihan accepted after she brought it up herself, Sophia's eyes widened. \\"What's up with you, Uncle? You kept telling her not to come.\\" \\"I received a quest to win.\\" \\"...There's even a quest like that? Uncle, are you playing a different game from us?\\" \\"It was suddenly given.\\" At the mention of receiving a quest, the people around looked at Seong Jihan with surprised faces, but only for a moment. Lee Hayeon pondered deeply and put forth her opinion with a serious expression. \\"If it's because of a quest, how about publicizing this to the world? Against strong countries like the US and China, the outcome could be determined by whether the owner is banned or not.\\" If they ended up facing the US in the finals, and the US coach was lucky enough to realize a 5-ban on Seong Jihan, the outcome of that match would be hard to guarantee. So Lee Hayeon suggested openly demanding the championship through publicizing this. \\"Would it go that far, Unnie?\\" \\"If the Jihan says he needs to clear a quest, people should naturally accept it. Plus, the Daegi Guild's effects have greatly increased this time, so everyone's being more cautious. For one championship, they'll probably concede.\\" Seong Jihan and the Daegi Guild were so important to humanity, she was confident they could sufficiently negotiate and have others concede the Champions League championship. However, \\"No, it's a bit much to openly reveal the quest details to the whole world.\\" Seong Jihan rejected this proposal. 'There's no need to openly demand the championship and invite needless wariness.' The Martial God's subordinates in Tuseong were also watching humanity's situation. There was no need to show them Seong Jihan making a fuss over the Champions League championship. \\"Rather, let's say Sophia's recruitment was actively pursued by the Korean association.\\" \\"Aha... As if the coach recruited her while the Jihan was training?\\" \\"Yes, that narrative would be better.\\" \\"Alright, I'll contact them right away.\\" * * * =Group B has been decided! Korea, England, Saudi Arabia, and Canada. =How do you view the group draw results? =Very good! Although England is a strong team, they don't match up to us. =That's right. Even if player Seong Jihan can't participate in the group stage matches due to training, advancing to the round of 16 won't be difficult! Listening to the commentators' voices saying the Group B results were favorable for Korea, \\"Coach, this is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>...\\" Lee Hayeon immediately pushed for Sophia's inclusion in the national team. The next day. [Round of 16 already confirmed? Group B draw results smile upon Korea.] [Coach Noh Yeong-jun makes surprise announcement to include player Sophia in national team lineup!] [Who is player Sophia? A promising Supporter prospect with the 'Trinity' gift.] [The US BattleNet Association expresses bewilderment at the sudden recruitment announcement.] The optimistic articles about the group stage results were short-lived. As Coach Noh Youngjun announced bringing Sophia from the US to the national team, the public's attention was entirely focused here. - Wow, Sophia is really naturalizing? - No, she kept saying she'd come but never did, so I didn't expect it... - Didn't Seong Jihan say there's no need to naturalize? - Yeah, he said that while mentioning the Sword King case. That he doesn't like that. - Hey, but is Sophia the same as the Sword King? She didn't even make the US national team lol - So the coach made the surprise announcement despite Seong Jihan's opposition? Whoa. - No way. There must have been some coordination. - Yeah, no matter how much of a coach Noh Youngjun is, he can't do something against Seong Jihan's wishes. The reactions to Sophia's recruitment were explosive. After all, she was a card that could supplement the Korean national team's chronic weakness in Supporter power in one go. In fact, if not for her special relationship with Seong Jihan, rather than coming from the US to Korea, she would have been recruited from Korea to the US. Although Lee Hayeon borrowed Coach Noh Yeong-jun's name to announce the recruitment proposal, perceptive people were saying it was possible because Seong Jihan agreed to it to some extent. - Then our only weakness is Mage now. Can't Massid come too? Hehe. - Massid ended up playing as Argentina's national representative last time. So he won't be able to participate in this Champions League. - That's a shame... Can't we recruit him next season at least? - Well, Massid is the breadwinner of his family in Argentina, so it's a bit sorry to take him away lol - Right, Sophia couldn't become a US representative due to lacking levels, but Massid's case is different. - Don't we have any Mages to nurture ourselves? - Yeah... Strangely, no Mage talents are emerging. - Seong Jihan emerged, so that's enough lol What more do you want? People expressed regret that if Massid was recruited too, Korea would be the definite strongest team this Champions League. However, with Sophia joining the national team, expectations for the championship grew even higher. And the match schedule released afterwards, had matches against the three countries scheduled consecutively in 2, 4, and 6 days. A considerably tight schedule. But there was a reason for this. - Why is the schedule so packed? - There's a Space League match in early next month, so it seems to be because of that. - The opponent this time is... World Tree Elves. - Ah, those guys again? - World Tree Elves No. 200. Rank 1. The Space League match held in early July. The opposing race for this game was the World Tree Elves again. Moreover, No. 200, who was running 1st in the Space League rankings. The Champions League had to end before the match against them. So this schedule was arranged very tightly. \\"Therefore, we will be handling the schedule at the BattleNet Center here until early July. It will be a hard march for everyone, but let's work hard for our goal of winning.\\" \\"Yes, Coach!\\" Meanwhile, at Korea's BattleNet Center, Coach Noh Youngjun was explaining this situation to the selected players. And after finishing the schedule talk, \\"Ah, and Sophia, who newly joined the national team this time. As you all know, she's one of the most promising prospects among Supporter players. She made a really difficult decision this time. Let's welcome her with applause.\\" He introduced Sophia, who joined the national team, to the players. \\"Hello everyone~ I'm Sophia. Nice to meet you~\\" Clap clap clap. As Sophia bowed her head, applause erupted from the crowd. Although she gave off a considerably different vibe from the Korean national team, the national team players, knowing their Supporter power was extremely weak, welcomed her with big applause and looked at her curiously. \\"Wow, her accent is really like a Korean. Just like when watching BattleTube.\\" \\"Is it true she naturalized because of player Seong Jihan?\\" \\"Why else would she come from the US to the Korean national team?\\" \\"But player Seong Jihan... Isn't he dating the Daegi Guild Master?\\" \\"Well, that's true, but...\\" The players whispered like that while glancing at where Seong Jihan was sitting. They didn't dare ask him directly, but it was a situation where gossip-like interest was bound to arise. \\"It's unexpected that brother-in-law let Sophia join the national team. He was so against it...\\" Yoon Sejin, who had left home to find artifacts according to the constellation's will, also returned to the BattleNet Center because of the Champions League and was watching this scene with interest. \\"Dad, the coach recruited her.\\" \\"Hoho, if Jihan didn't allow it, do you think the coach would have recruited her arbitrarily?\\" \\"Well... That's true.\\" Seong Jihan smiled wryly as he listened to the Yoon father and daughter's words. Originally, Seong Jihan hadn't even agreed, but they tried to make it seem like the Korean BattleNet Association recruited Sophia because of the Champions League. 'My status was too high.' Perhaps because Seong Jihan's position in the BattleNet industry was so high, people naturally accepted that he agreed to this. In fact, if he opposed, with what power would the Korean BattleNet Association recruit Sophia? Seong Jihan roughly explained this situation to Yoon Se-jin. \\"A situation arose where I have to win this time. So I brought out a surefire card.\\" \\"Is that so? A situation... It must not be an ordinary problem if even Sophia is joining.\\" Hearing those words, Yoon Sejin nodded his head. \\"Alright, I'll also do my best to win.\\" In his eyes as he said that, a golden light was flickering ever so slightly. And that, '...That light is peculiar.' Seong Jihan did not miss. Text 298: The pure white gauntlet that came out of Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods. At a glance, it was exuding an intense energy. 'There's no item description or anything.' Perhaps because it wasn't classified as an item in BattleNet, there was no particular explanation. 'Giving it to others seems risky, should I try equipping it?' The constellation fragment that had threatened Seong Jihan quite a bit. Since it came from that being, there was a risk in giving this object to other humans. Seong Jihan brought his hand to the pure white gauntlet. It was an object whose size didn't match a human hand, but. Shwooo... As Seong Jihan inserted his hand, it changed size to fit his hand and was sucked into him. Then. [Martial God... If I had this, could I have beaten him?] A scene unfolded in Seong Jihan's mind. The opponent he had just fought, with a head and 3 hands. The process and experience of that being ruminating on the battle it had with the Martial God, researching how it could have blocked his strike. It was indirectly experienced by Seong Jihan as well. 'This... is really completely different from humans.' The original form of the constellation that fought Seong Jihan was an alien race with only an upper body and 6 arms attached. The way it handled its energy was on a different level from humans. Just as humans cannot understand how to operate wings they don't have. The power usage method of a constellation with 6 arms was also something Seong Jihan couldn't relate to at all. [The characteristic of the Heterogeneous Martial Resolve class is activated.] The Heterogeneous Martial Resolve that he had changed to before but never had a chance to use. It was activated here. [The authority of an alien race is researched and absorbed in a way suitable for your species.] [It is the authority of a constellation. You understand it only fragmentarily.] The incomprehensible power operation of six hands moving. However, the Heterogeneous Martial Resolve made Seong Jihan understand this, even if only fragmentarily, in a way suitable for him. [Void increases by 5.] [Martial Soul increases by 5.] Furthermore, while absorbing the power inside the gauntlet to fit his body, it raised the two stats by 5 each. 'This is quite a nice bonus.' Not only did the stats increase. Changing the experience of using 6 arms to fit humanity and adding it to his martial arts was also a big help. He hadn't fully absorbed this experience yet. But if he made it his own, it seemed like it would help quite a bit. Seong Jihan thought while looking at his hand where the gauntlet had disappeared. 'When I used Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods on the Succubus Queen's avatar before, there was no such effect... Is it because the opponent was constellation-grade? Then the constellation artifacts in Tuseong might have all been made this way too.' But then why was the Martial God just displaying those many constellation artifacts like stars in the sky? Seong Jihan had that question, but. [You survived the longest in the final round of the Northern Wall.] [Logging out from the Northern Wall to calculate the rewards for the entire guild.] As he was logged out of the game due to the end of the guild mission, he stopped thinking about this for now. Right now, it was time to organize the rewards from the end of the guild mission. * * * Special Defense Map, the Northern Wall. Even though Seong Jihan could have chosen an individual mission here, he proceeded with the guild mission to aim for additional guild rewards. At first, the gap between the human rankers and Seong Jihan was so huge that it was doubtful if the mission could proceed smoothly. 'Octane's information was useful.' Thanks to the 'Ability Sharing' information provided by Lue Investment's Octane. The Daegi Guild was able to reach the final round without much difficulty. And. [Achieved 1st place in the guild mission.] [Earned 10 guild points.] [Obtained the guild-exclusive title, 'Defender of the Northern Wall'.] Although Seong Jihan couldn't continuously bring buffs from the Resting Place of the Dead. Perhaps because the entire team survived for quite a while thanks to Ability Sharing, humanity took 1st place on the map. In addition to earning 10 points, the Daegi Guild also gained a guild title. [Defender of the Northern Wall] - A title given to the guild that places 1st on the Northern Wall map. - Raises the level of all guild options by +5. 'This is quite useful.' Guild points that were extremely difficult to obtain normally. The guild mission supplemented this in one go. And these rewards weren't just applied to the Daegi Guild. \\"Wow, Uncle. I got +5 residual stats from participating this time!\\" \\"Oh, really?\\" \\"Yeah. The other guild members got at least +3 too. And they received a ton of experience and leveled up... Everyone's happy they participated well.\\" \\"With good results, we should be able to receive additional GP as written in the contract!\\" Lee Hayeon, the guild master who had recruited rankers for the guild mission and received a certain amount of GP. She had agreed in the contract to receive additional GP if the rewards from the guild mission turned out to be more valuable than expected. \\"Is this enough to receive more money?\\" \\"Of course! Do you know how hard it is to get residual stats!\\" \\"Even though it's only +3 to 5?\\" \\"That's huge... Jihan.\\" \\"Uncle... That remark is like a chaebol not knowing bus fare.\\" TL/n: chaebol means a large family-owned business conglomerate. For Seong Jihan, who had raised his stats by +10 just by absorbing a gauntlet, the value of residual points was hard to grasp. Yoon Seah glared at Seong Jihan and asked. \\"Then what rewards did Uncle get from the mission?\\" \\"First, it's focused on guild rewards. As for individual rewards...\\" Seong Jihan checked the final message. [You survived until the end in the guild mission.] [Level increases by 10.] [Obtained +10 residual points.] The rewards from this mission, reaching level 320 and gaining 10 residual points. Seong Jihan spoke with a dissatisfied look. \\"Level +10, residual points +10. It's mediocre.\\" \\"...10 is mediocre?\\" \\"Well, I had been getting rewards from missions so far.\\" Every time he did a mission, an epic quest would pop up and give decent rewards. But this time, perhaps because that didn't happen, he only received double the rewards compared to other players. 'Guess I'll raise my red stat with the residual points.' Seong Jihan dumped the residual points he received this time into the red stat, which had the lowest value. But when he invested 20, the red stat only increased by 1. Considering the point investment before, the unranked Red stat had a tremendously low investment efficiency. 'It eats up a lot of points.' Seong Jihan frowned as he looked at the Red stat that became 13. It was the same for the other stats not increasing, but this one was a bit more severe. \\"I should go train.\\" \\"Train? The group drawing is soon, aren't you going to watch?\\" \\"What group drawing?\\" \\"For the World Champions League.\\" \\"Ah, is it that season already?\\" As June began, the rankings of regional leagues around the world were all determined. In the Northeast Asia League, South Korea and China advanced to the main event of the World Champions League. The group drawing for the round of 32 in the Champions League main event. Each group would have 4 countries drawn, forming 8 groups. \\"Our country became the 1st seed. It's the first time in history!\\" \\"Well, of course, since we won everything this year.\\" \\"Eek, Uncle seems indifferent...\\" \\"After entering the main game of BattleNet, the meaning of the Champions League has diminished a lot.\\" \\"That's true. After all, everyone's attention is focused on the Space League these days.\\" Lee Hayeon, who had come to the penthouse to report, nodded in agreement with Seong Jihan's words. In the past, the Champions League of BattleNet, the only sport for humanity, was a worldwide festival. But now, the Space League matches were taking its place in terms of topic. After all, the Champions League was about establishing a hierarchy between countries. Whereas the Space League had the fate of all humanity riding on the outcome of each match. The group drawing details that would have been featured in all media in the past. This time, it was sharing the news with the results of Seong Jihan's guild mission. \\"Then Uncle, you're going to train without watching? I ordered pizza and chicken.\\" \\"...Why did you order that so early?\\" \\"If you don't order 2 hours before the drawing, it won't come~ Even if the Champions League has lost popularity, it's still the No. 1 hit.\\" \\"That's right, Jihan Have a meal before you go. But what will you eat inside the training room?\\" \\"I just fast.\\" \\"What, really?\\" \\"Yeah, now that I don't need to eat, it doesn't affect me.\\" Seong Jihan, whose body had changed to not require food intake after obtaining the life force. \\"Then you'll keep starving if you go, isn't your mouth bored~ Eat this time before you leave.\\" \\"Alright. I'll eat before I go.\\" He smiled at Yoon Seah's continued urging and sat on the sofa. \\"Wow, Jihan. But the guild's option points suddenly increased a lot?\\" \\"The rewards from the guild mission were given.\\" \\"The growth rate has risen tremendously again... I'll have to receive more GP from the guild members?\\" \\"We should. The title also increased the member capacity, so please collect a lot of GP.\\" \\"Yes! I'll tell them to contact me.\\" While Lee Hayeon was encouraged by the greatly enhanced guild options and calling the Daegi Guild staff. \\"Uncle, can I take a look at that cube from earlier?\\" \\"The Celestial Cube?\\" \\"Yeah, I'm curious that it increases humanity's limit.\\" At Yoon Seah's request, Seong Jihan opened his inventory. The Celestial Cube that had become useless because humanity's limit wasn't set. It was the size of Seong Jihan's palm, sitting there. \\"On the outside, it just looks like a shiny cube...\\" Yoon Seah examined the cube on Seong Jihan's hand from various angles. Then she tilted her head. \\"But... there's a strange pattern here?\\" \\"Really?\\" At Yoon Seah's words, Seong Jihan examined the cube. 'It's true.' It wasn't visible during the guild mission, but now that he was in the real world, a pattern was subtly revealed. 90% was pure white, but 10% had a subtle red tint. 'Hmm... I feel Red from here.' As Seong Jihan touched that pattern. Flash! The cube emitted a faint light, and the intense Red from the pattern began moving towards Seong Jihan's chest. Although it was energy from a small cube. It was much more intense than when he collected the remnant energy of the Fire God. 'I won't be able to take it all.' The red pattern was filled with power. [Stat 'Red' increases by 1.] The Red stat that increased by 1 when he invested over 20 residual points before. It increased by 1 more just by touching the cube. If the Red-filled energy from the cube kept entering, rather than the stat increasing, his chest might have exploded. But the Celestial Cube kept the limit exactly. '...Did it have another function besides increasing the species' limit?' Thanks for raising the stat. As Seong Jihan was looking at the white cube with a doubtful gaze. Swish. From the cracks of the cube's pattern, a message window abruptly popped out. [Assigning a quest suitable for the user's situation...] 'It's... giving a quest?' * * * =The group drawing for this year's Champions League main event. It's finally starting! =Our country has been proudly assigned as the 1st seed this year! The biggest role in this was played by player Seong Jihan! =The betting odds of bookmakers surrounding the Champions League victory, our country is 2nd after the United States! We've surpassed even China! The Champions League group drawing ceremony began. Yoon Seah set up the delivered food just in time and said to Seong Jihan sitting on the sofa. \\"Uncle, let's eat first!\\" \\"Ah, yeah... But why did you order so much? Is someone else coming?\\" 4 pizzas and 5 chickens. Seong Jihan asked Yoon Seah as he looked at the food filling the table in front of the sofa. \\"The unnies and Sophia said they're coming.\\" \\"Still, isn't this a bit much?\\" \\"Do you know how many calories players consume? They need to eat at least this much to survive.\\" Yoon Seah spoke as if it was obvious, but. \\"Seah, you can't lie. Jihan, Seah eats half of that by herself.\\" \\"What, no way. Unnie is no joke either! She told me to order the chicken!\\" The truth was quickly revealed by Lim Gayeoung's words as she came out of the training room. Seong Jihan laughed as he watched the two bickering. \\"Order more if it's not enough. I'll eat first.\\" He picked up a pizza and brought it to his mouth. Meanwhile, in front of his eyes. [Assigning a quest suitable for the user's situation...] The message that came out of the cube's cracks a while ago kept... refreshing. At first, he was glad that it said it would give a quest. 'If you're not going to give it, just get rid of the message window?' It said it would give one, but even after more than an hour, the message window just stayed there. Seong Jihan frowned as he looked at the red message window that returned to the center even when he dragged it far away. If you're going to give it, give it quickly, what a nuisance. At that moment. =Ah, our country is assigned to Group B! =As for the 2nd seed team... England is coming in! As Korea was placed in Group B and the opposing countries were assigned in turn. The message window that had been displaying ... finally changed. [A quest suitable for the user will be given.] [Win the Champions League.] [Reward: Designated as a Constellation Candidate] 'Winning the Champions League... This is the quest suitable for my situation?' Seong Jihan made a puzzled expression at the unexpected quest.","completion":"<The War God Who Regressed to Level 2, Episode 301> [South Korea, Into the Finals!] [The Sword King, who gained the Mage class, becomes the hero leading South Korea to the final match.] [The weakness of the South Korean team vanishes, now facing the USA in the final showdown.] -Wow, never thought I'd see our country make it to the finals in my lifetime... -Exactly. Even with Seong Jihan, I thought it'd be tough to win past the semi-finals if he gets banned... -Except for the loss to England, we've won every match LOL -If we beat the USA with a 3:0, does that make England the second strongest in the world? -How do we beat the USA 3:0 though -_-; Let's not count our chickens before they hatch. The South Korean team, excluding the match against England, crushed their way to the finals with a consistent 3:0 victory in each match. However, the USA, their final opponent, was a formidable force from another dimension. -The interface and language of BattleNet are all in English because of the US, LOL -We managed to win without Seong Jihan against India, but the USA is a different story... -Hope Sophia, our supporter hope, wasn't also scouted from the US? -Nope, she couldn't make it due to her level. If she did join their supporter ranks, she'd be top 3. -TOP3... it means the USA has at least three Sophias, damn. After beating China 3:1 in the semi-finals, the USA's sheer power overshadowed Korea's. Objectively, the USA's overall strength heavily outweighed Korea's, aside from their warrior lineup and the bolstered archer squad with Yoon Seah's addition. And even with these classes, it wasn't a guarantee they could beat the USA. The mage and supporter classes were noticeably weaker by comparison. Experts predicted a gallant fight from Korea but an eventual win for the USA. However, the finals could bring an unforeseen variable. -If only Seong Jihan doesn't get banned... -We might actually have a shot at winning. Indeed, Seong Jihan was the variable. After displaying a vast gap between him and current humanity in the recent guild mission, his presence was akin to a cheat key that could disrupt the game. -If we secure one game in the 1st or 2nd, and Seong Jihan only gets banned twice in games 3, 4, 5, we win. -Ah, but he's been banned too well up until now. Just one appearance against India in the 3rd match. -All part of saving up for the final. -For real, time for him to dodge bans like a boss and become the finals MVP LOL Though Seong Jihan had only participated once up to the semi-finals, which actually might have been a stroke of luck for him to dodge bans in the final. Contrastingly, the US fans hoped for his misfortune to continue just until the final match concludes. -The... unfortunately, it seems Seong Jihan's luck might be running out. Let's hope it lasts till tomorrow. -Right. After tomorrow, his luck can turn around. We still have the match against the World Tree Elves. -If we win the first two matches and he gets banned just once, victory is ours. -Even without Seong Jihan, Korea is a formidable team, but not enough to defeat us. They wished for Seong Jihan's streak of bad luck to carry over to the final match. \\"Woah, the USA... They're just too strong.” In the BattleNet Center's strategy room, Yoon Seah sighed while watching the 4:3 match between the USA and China. This much-anticipated match had the two nations pulling out all their stops, revealing hidden strategies and thrilling plays, justifying its pre-battle hype. Although the final score was 3:1, The gap in power displayed here was much larger than the score suggested. \\"The second match was a loss because the US let its guard down.” \\"That's right. Mage Barron made a critical error. Without that, the US would've dominated 3:0.\\" \\"Why does Barron, with his two status screens, make such mistakes... When will he break out of this slump?” \\"Probably never.” Seong Jihan commented while glancing at the replay. Being nervous in crucial matches was Barron's trademark. \\"We really need Uncle to step up for the final match.” \\"If the bans lift, I can definitely end it. But it’s uncertain how the finals will play out.” \\"Time for that bad luck to break! We're snagging at least one win.” \\"Count on it.” Seong Jihan nodded, gazing into the air, almost as if he saw the system messages floating there. His expression seemed to be communicating silently with something unseen, reminding everyone of the times he'd the system messages in the past. In the strategy room, as Yoon Sejin threw a question at Seong Jihan who was vigilantly monitoring USA's gameplay, \\"Hyung-in-law, what are you looking at? Got another quest or something?\\" \\"Ah, just browsing through the BattleNet market.” \\"Market? Uncle, what are you shopping for?” \\"Turns out, some aliens uploaded their training videos there.” As he recalled the events of a few days ago, * * * Class: Heterogeneous Martial God. After deciding to utilize this class he'd switched to but hadn't really used, Seong Jihan, examining the effectiveness after employing the Myriad Ghost Sealing Gods against the former avatar of the Succubus Queen, pondered further usage. -Considering the experience... Master, why not scour the BattleNet Market? Suggested Ariel, who had been quietly resting on Seong Jihan's arm after a long silence, offering a strategy. -The Market sells that too? -Punch in 'video,' and you'll find a crate-load. Granted, most of it is junk... if you're curious about how different races wield their power, you might find it somewhat vicarious. Thus, Seong Jihan ventured into the ‘video’ section of the BattleNet Market. As Ariel hinted, the keywords unearthed all manner of content. “Ah, so that's why you've been staring into space lately. Alien training videos... Useful?” “Mostly, the market's content is 95% garbage. Half of that is alien mating footage.” “Ma, mating?” “Yes. I fail to grasp why these aliens broadcast their reproductive acts. And the number of egg-laying scenes...” Remembering the discarded videos, Seong Jihan scrunched his brow. While pondering the alien's diverse power use, he again questioned the universe's perversion. “1GP videos were exclusively of that variety.” “Th, that so? Then... the remaining 5%?” “Those had some utility.” Alien training videos proved to be pearls amidst the mud for Seong Jihan. While mostly surface-level due to their publicly shared nature, lacking in-depth training methods, ‘The sheer foreignness of alien power application was a fresh jolt.’ Barred from participating due to bans, Seong Jihan dug through the market, making use of Class: Heterogeneous Martial God. “I wonder if I’d find any training videos useful too?” “Hard to say; it benefited me due to class effects, but to others, it may offer nothing. Sensations like manipulating wings or detaching one's tail to escape... won't inspire ordinary players.” “Ah, those kinds it is…” “Curious? I can show you one.” “Sure, let me see.” “Why not, me too?” Seong Jihan nodded, pulling out an alien training video for the curious duo. “How do we play this?” “Touch it and say 'play,' and it'll project almost like VR.” “Ooh... BattleNet's innovations.” Toggling the object, not unlike a wizard's crystal ball, the pair exclaimed, \\"Play,\\" in a setup that resembled VR viewing. “...Learning to fly further? What's with the wing movements?” “Navigating breath fire seems utterly non-applicable…” Shortly after starting, they returned the device, baffled by the incomprehensible content. Even for these two, peaking in their respective classes, Warrior and Archer, the videos offered little takeaway. ‘Without Heterogeneous Martial God, these count as junk after all. It’s like a VR documentary for different species.’ To an average player, buying such content was akin to tossing money into the wind. However, for Seong Jihan, possessing Heterogeneous Martial God, these videos were proving quite beneficial. ‘Already gained 5 more Martial Souls from watching.’ With spare time, given his bans, the gain was significant. Resolving to keep diving into alien videos while he had the chance, Seong Jihan dived back into the BattleNet Market. That moment, “Brother-in-law, can we talk outside for a bit?” Yoon Sejin, who had been with him in the strategy room, signaled they move. Suggesting the rooftop with a gesture, Seong Jihan agreed, closing the BattleNet Market. * * * On the rooftop of the BattleNet Center, “It’s a nice day.” Yoon Sejin launched their small talk by gazing skyward, ‘The gold is deepening.’ The golden aura in Yoon Sejin’s eyes, intensifying as the tournament progressed, was shining its brightest yet. “The Divine Seat asked if you found his help useful.” “Reaching the finals owed much to brother-in-law’s assistance. Tell him it was greatly beneficial.” “Good to hear… Well then.” Suddenly, Yoon Sejin’s eyes burst with light. A protective shield formed around them, isolating both from the outside world. “Since he aided you, may I ask a question.” “About Gilgamesh?” “That’s right.” “What’s your question?” “What’s your quest reward?” Yoon Sejin, incarnated by Gilgamesh, bypassed all formalities straight to the matter at hand. Seong Jihan chuckled at the unexpected focus on quest rewards. “Didn’t expect you’d be interested in something so trivial.” “A guild fight’s victory rewarding a quest is unheard of.” “Is it? It does give me one, though.” “And the reward? Regardless of what you get, just know.” Gilgamesh, through Yoon Sejin, finally posed the main question. “In case the reward fixes you as a candidate for the Divine Seat… I advise not clearing it now.” “Why? You told me to remain a variable.” As Seong Jihan recalled Gilgamesh’s previous advice, hoping to stay a unpredictable element in their plans. -Gilgamesh aimed for Seong Jihan to remain an unpredictable factor, potentially delaying his Divine Seat candidacy, directing attention away from him. Recalling their prior conversations, Seong Jihan challenged him back. “To truly become the variable you wish, you need to survive Longinus’s attack first. Only by defeating him will you truly become a threat. ‘Awakening the third’ depends on it.” With earnest in his gaze, Gilgamesh stressed Seong Jihan’s imperative survival and ultimate defiance against the Divine Beings. And as Gilgamesh clasped his eyes with such conviction, “In humanity’s name… For a grand cause, indeed.” Seong Jihan found within himself the power to oppose even the king’s commanding words. “Unless you convince me, I cannot follow.” Seeing Seong Jihan resist the ‘Divine Mandate,’ Gilgamesh appeared shocked before chuckling. “...Impressive, to fully defy my words. Very well, that makes you a true 'variable.'” Despite the defiance. “If this leads astray… I must intervene. This victory, I cannot allow.” Gilgamesh solemnly declared, holding authority until the last moment. * * * The next day. =The first bans selection for Game 1 begins...! =Oh… The US has chosen not to ban Seong Jihan for this round…. From Game 1 of the finals, an unexpected development unfolded."},{"prompt":"Thank you, here is text 302, please translate it exactly as it is but also keep it natural and coveying the original meaning. Text 302: <2레벨로 회귀한 무신 302화> 챔피언스 리그 결승전. 최초로 결승에 진출하는 한국과. 거의 대부분의 챔피언스 리그에서, 빠짐없이 결승전에 올랐던 미국. 많은 사람들은 전력상 한국을 앞서는 미국이 이번에도 우승을 차지할 것이라고 생각했지만. 여기에는 한 가지 변수가 있었다. -성지한 밴 3번만 어떻게 풀릴 수 없나. -저번 경기들에선 재수가 없었으니까, 여기서 행운 터뜨려야지. -성지한만 열리면 무조건 이기는데! 플레이어 랭킹 1위 성지한. 비록 토너먼트에서는 밴 때문에 1경기만 출전했지만, 그는 명실상부한 한국 대표팀의 핵심축이었다. 나오기만 하면, 아무리 미국 대표팀이라고 해도 100% 패배할 거라고 모두가 인정하는 선수. 그래서 배틀넷 팬들은 남녀노소 할 것 없이, 미국이 성지한 밴을 기본으로 깔고 갈 것이라 생각했다. 한데. =이게 무슨 일입니까? 왜 성에게 밴 카드를 쓰지 않죠?! =대체 감독은 무슨 생각입니까? 성지한 선수는 1-5경기 모두 밴하는 게 기본 아닌가요?! =그 대신 1-10위 2명 밴을 택하다니……. =아, 성지한 선수. 밴에 걸려들지 않습니다! 한국의 2위, 검왕이 대신 걸려듭니다. =감독, 대체 뭐 하나요?! 미국 해설진은 모두 목청 높여, 감독의 이해할 수 없는 결정을 비난했다. -뭐지? 왜 밴 안 함? -와, 개꿀이네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 1경기 편-안 하게 시청 가능? 그리고 한국 팬들은 이를 보며, 처음엔 좋아했지만. 그것도 잠시. -아, 근데…… 꼭 성지한 밴 안 할 때 성좌 튀어나오던데 ㅡㅡ -그러네? 러시아나 대만전 떠올려 봐도……. -그래도 결국 이기긴 했잖아. 그 게임들 ㅋㅋ -이거 경기 진행 양상 보기 전까지 안심은 못 하겠다. 성지한이 밴 당하지 않았을 때는, 꼭 성좌들이 튀어나와서 경기를 이상하게 끌고 갔기에. 조마조마한 심정으로, 게임 진행을 바라보았다. =1경기 맵은, ‘하나의 다리’로 선정되었습니다! =다리 하나를 두고 양 진영이 맞붙는 맵이죠. 짧은 맵의 특성상, 전사의 힘이 가장 중요한데…… 하필 성지한이 밴에서 풀려 버렸어요! =사실 짧은 맵이든, 큰 맵이든 뭐가 되었던 성지한 상대로는 난항을 겪었겠습니다만…… 전망이 좋지 않군요. 감독, 대체 왜 그를 풀어준 겁니까? =대 성지한 상대로 히든카드라도 있는 걸까요? =제발 있었으면 좋겠군요! 밴에서 성지한이 풀린 것부터, 맵 선정까지 한국에게 유리하게 흘러가는 1경기. 하지만, 대표팀 선수들은 이런 상황에도 오히려 긴장을 늦추지 않았다. ‘성지한 선수를 괜히 풀었을 리가 없어.’ ‘분명히 뭔가 준비한 게 있을 거야.’ ‘설마 또 성좌인가?’ 상대가 저런 선택을 한 데에는, 분명 믿는 구석이 있다고 본 것이다. 한편 성지한도. ‘길가메시가 무언가 손을 썼나.’ 그리 생각하면서, 하나의 다리에 소환되자마자 만반의 채비를 갖추었다. 힘을 모두 끌어올린 것은 물론. “소피아, 지금 바로 버프 줄 수 있겠습니까?” “물론이죠!” 성화가 깃든 버프까지 받으며, 전력을 끌어올린 그는. 다리 건너를 바라보았다. ‘굳이 접근할 필요 없이, 멀리서 전멸시켜야겠군.’ 길가메시의 안배가 숨겨져 있을 것으로 의심되는 미국 진영. 거기에 굳이 장단을 맞춰 줄 필요야 없었다. 지금 성지한에게 가장 중요한 건, 이 게임의 우승이었으니까. ‘그는 인류를 위해서라고는 했지만, 나를 설득이 아닌 세뇌를 하려 했지.’ 성좌 길가메시. 그는 기본적으로 성지한에게 우호적인 스탠스를 취하고 있었지만. 그것은 협력자라기보다는, 장기말을 쓸모 있게 취급해주는 것에 가까웠다. 그가 무신과 적대적이라고 한들, 그게 꼭 이쪽의 아군이란 뜻은 아니지. ‘처음부터 전력을.’ 성지한은 봉황기를 꺼내, 하늘로 던졌다. 불과 뇌전의 기운이 뒤섞인 창은 순식간에 하늘로 사라지더니. 쿠르르르……! 푸른 하늘에, 거대한 구멍을 만들어 내었다. =아, 플레이어 성의 갓 스피어입니까……!? =스페이스 리그에서는 그렇게 든든했는데, 당하는 입장이 되어보니 공포군요! =예전보다 구멍이 더 커졌어요! =그래도, 막아설 방법…… 있지 않겠습니까? 성의 밴까지 풀었는데! 방송을 통해, 수차례 모습을 선보였던 천주심판. 외국에서 ‘갓 스피어’라는 별칭이 붙여진 이 무공은, 압도적인 크기로 인해 대중적으로 가장 뇌리에 박혀 있는 성지한의 스킬이었다. 사람들은 모두, 저 거대한 균열에서 곧 뇌창이 내려올 것이라고 예상했지만. =어……. =하늘에, 불길이 일렁입니다……? 초장부터 전력을 다한 성지한의 무공은, 천주심판이 아니었다. 화르르륵! 창이 꿰뚫은 거대한 원형 구멍의 테두리가 불길에 잠기고. 하늘은 순식간에 새하얀 불꽃으로 가득 찼다. 그리고 그 위에, 붉은 뇌전이 피어오르더니. 태양의 열기가 커져 가는 균열에 집중되었다. 혼원신공混元神功 천뢰용염天雷龍炎 천룡뇌화天龍雷火 하늘이 무너져 내리며, 강렬한 불길이 벼락처럼 내리꽂는다. 목표는 미국 대표팀의 진영. 아니, 다리 건너의 지형 전부다. =이, 이건…… 드래곤 브레스…… 입니까? =대표팀! 막아야 해요! 미국 해설자들은 비명을 내지르며 대표팀의 대응을 촉구했지만. 아무리 세계 최강의 대표팀이라 한들, 저 불길을 막아설 도리는 없었다. 번쩍! 새하얀 빛으로 순식간에 물들어 버린, 다리 건너의 세계. 빛 사이사이에서 붉은 뇌전이 번뜩이며 흐르더니. 화르르륵! 두 땅을 잇던, 튼튼하기 그지없는 ‘하나의 다리’에도 순식간에 불길이 번지기 시작했다. 그러더니 순식간에 먼지가 되어 사라지는 다리. 건너편의 한국 대표팀은, 그 모습을 그저 멍한 얼굴로 바라보았다. “와…….” “다리가 타네…….” “이 다리, 아무리 두들겨도 안 없어지는 거 아니었어?” “다리가 문제냐? 저쪽 땅 봐 봐.” “……아예 지반이 무너졌는데?” 미국 대표팀이 베이스캠프로 삼던 다리 건너의 절벽. 그곳은 이미 새하얀 불길에, 삭제가 되고 있는 상태였다. 성지한의 힘이 강력한 건 모두 알긴 했지만. 게임 지형을 저렇게 없애도 되는 거야? “삼촌, 뭐…… 한 거야?” 소피아한테 버프 받고, 자기도 열심히 싸우겠다면서 활시위를 당기던 윤세아는. 눈앞의 적진이 아예 사라지자, 황당하단 눈으로 성지한을 바라보았다. 자기도 대기만성 때문에 사기 소리 들으면서 쭉쭉 성장해 왔다지만. 뛰는 자 위에 나는 자 있다고. 성지한은 볼 때마다 힘이 일취월장해 있었다. “저쪽이 이상한 짓 하기 전에, 그냥 쓸어버렸지.” “미국 대표팀 상대로…… 그런 게 가능하구나.” “버프까지 받은 상태로 나름 전력을 썼어.” 천룡뇌화. 드래곤 로드의 ‘최초의 브레스’를 맞았을 때의 감각을 떠올리며, 천주심판을 개량시킨 이 무공은. 예전부터 다른 조건은 모두 충족했으되, 마지막 퍼즐이 맞춰지지 않는 상태였다. 하지만. ‘배틀넷에서 영상구를 수집한 게 도움이 되었어.’ 이종무해를 써먹기 위해, 무차별적으로 수집했던 영상구. 거기에는 용족과, 그 아류 종족의 경험이 녹아 있는 것도 있었다. 그들이 어떻게 힘을 쓰는지 보고 느끼고 나서야. 성지한은 천주심판을 뛰어넘은 것은 물론. 마지막에는 드래곤 로드의 권능까지 끌어다 쓸 수 있었다. ‘스탯 적의 힘이 부족해서, 한 번 쓰면 남아나는 기운이 없는 게 문제지만.’ 천룡뇌화에는 적의 권능이 핵심이었기에, 이걸 사용하고는 몸 안의 기운이 텅텅 비어 버린 성지한. 지금 상태에서 강적을 만나면, 힘이 회복되기 전까지는 싸움을 피해야겠지. 하지만. 상대, 미국 대표팀은 그 정도로 강적은 아니었다. [적이 전멸했습니다.] [1경기가 종료됩니다.] 반 이상 삭제된 상대측 절벽 지형. 그 안에 생존자 따위는, 존재하질 않았다. * * * =이럴수가……, =저, 저게 대체 뭐란 말입니까! =이래서 플레이어 성을 풀어주면 안 됐는데……! 시작하자마자 종료된 1경기. 미국 해설자들은 성지한의 새 기술에 경악하며, 감독의 1경기 선택을 성토했다. 하지만, 그건 시작에 불과했으니. =아, 아니, 이렇게 당하고도 밴을 푼다구요? =감독 미쳤습니까? =F***!! 뭐 하는 거야 진짜!! 2경기에 들어왔음에도, 미국 감독이 밴을 하지 않자. 다혈질적인 캐스터가 분노를 참지 못하고 쌍욕을 내뱉었다. -아니 미국 해설 미쳤나 전 세계에서 보는데 F 워드 날리네 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -그만큼 빡친다는 거죠 ㅋㅋㅋ -성지한 근데 진짜 세도 너무 세네. -아까 건 드래곤 브레스같지 않았음? -ㅇㅇ 그것도 드래곤보다 더 강력한 브레스였음. -게임 맵을 삭제시켜 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 성지한의 천룡뇌화. 그 압도적인 힘을 본 한국 시청자들은 역시 성지한이라면서 고무된 상태였다. 그러면서 2경기에서도 성지한 밴이 풀리자. 혹시 설마 이번에 최초로 우승하는 거 아니냐고, 기대를 보이고 있었다. 한편. =근데 감독, 왜 맵은 셀렉트 안 하는 거죠? =그냥 정신이 나가 버렸습니까? 밴 카드를 그렇게 쓸모없게 버릴 거면 뭐하러 감독한답니까? =스태프가 나서서 이를 제지해야 하지 않나요? 어떻게 저걸 지켜보고만 있는지……! 미국 해설자들은 분통을 터뜨리며 스태프가 이를 제지해야 하지 않냐고 코멘트했지만. =아…… 경기 그대로 진행됩니다. 맵은, 사우스 게이트입니다. =아악! 사우스게이트! 이 맵도 성지한 선수가 브레스 쓰면 끝장나잖아요! =차라리 맵이라도 잘 골라야지, 미쳤어요! 뭐 하자는 겁니까, 진짜!! 2경기도, 그대로 진행되었다. 성지한이 살고, 맵은 그에게 유리한 사우스 게이트로 걸린 채. 마치 게임을 포기한 것 같은 미국 대표팀. -미국 왜 저럼? -한국에게 우승 주기로 밀약이라도 된 건가? -뭐…… 주시면 감사히 받겠습니다 ^^ 한국 시청자들은 영문을 몰랐지만, 어쨌든 고맙다는 반응이 주류였다면. -FXXX! 아니 어린아이한테 밴 셀렉트 맡겨도 이거보단 잘하겠다!! -지금 내 7살짜리 아들도 분통을 터뜨리고 있어. 성지한 밴, 마법사 맵 셀렉트 왜 안 하냐고 집에서 펑펑 울고 있다고!! -그 애를 감독으로 보내 -그게 진짜 낫겠어. 대체 이게 무슨 추태야? 미국 시청자들은 난리가 난 상태였다. 욕을 기본으로 꺼내며 도배되는 채팅. 2경기 게임 결과는, 모두의 예상대로였다. =아아아악!! =사우스 게이트, 무너집니다! =또 브레스가 작렬했어요! 성 전체가 아예 사라집니다……! =하…… 하하. 미국이 결승전에서 이러다가는 최초로 3대0으로 패하겠어요. 시청자들이 귀 아플 정도로 소리를 빽 지르는 미국 해설자들. 그들이 절규할 정도로, 2경기의 양상도 원사이드했다. 성지한이 하늘에 창을 던지자, 그대로 내리꽂힌 드래곤 브레스. 성벽은 미국 대표팀과 함께 가루가 되어 사라지고. 한국 대표팀은 이미 2세트에서, 2승을 선취했다. 이제 1승만 얻으면, 우승이 눈앞에 보이는 상황. =대체 뭡니까? 뭐 하는 겁니까? =맵은 왜, 1경기 2경기 다 셀렉트 안 하는 거죠?! 미국이 세계수 엘프인 줄 아나요? =아…… 어? 3경기. 밴합니다? =감독. 드디어 정신 돌아왔나요!? =서, 성지한만 밴하면 가능성은 있습니다! 하나 3경기부터는, 미국 대표팀의 전략이 정상적으로 가동되었다. 압도적 플레이어인 성지한을 밴하고. 인간계의 플레이어들끼리 자웅을 겨루겠다는, 7살 짜리 아이도 아는 전략. =한데 맵은…… 왜 셀렉트 안하죠? =괜찮습니다! 성지한 선수 밴한 게 어딥니까! =음…… 정말 세계수 엘프처럼 5경기 때 맵 셀렉트 하려고 그런 걸까요? =아, 그럴지도 모르겠군요! 왜 굳이 그러는지는 모르겠지만 말이죠! 3경기에 들어선 미국 대표팀은. 1, 2경기 때와는 전혀 다른 모습을 보였다. 팀 대 팀으로 맞붙은 경기 양상은. 처음부터 끝까지, 완전한 미국의 우위였다. =미, 미국. 승리를 따냅니다! =3경기부터 시작이죠. 이제부터 뒤집으면 됩니다! =4경기 때 성지한 선수를 밴하게 되면…… 5경기. 거기서 50퍼센트의 확률로 게임의 승패가 나뉘겠군요! 그리고 곧바로 시작된 4경기는, 미국 해설자들의 바람대로 진행되었다. 성지한이 밴을 당하고. 팀 대 팀에서 한국을 압도하는 미국 대표팀. 3경기에 이어, 4경기도. 미국은 강력한 전력을 내보이며, 한국 대표팀을 짓밟았다. -아 미국 졸라 세네……. -역시 성지한 없으면 힘든가 ㅡㅡ; -ㅇㅇ 여기까지 온 게 기적이긴 했음. -4경기 때 검왕 움직임이 아쉽네…… 너무 돌진했어……. -아, 이러면 5경기인가. 50퍼센트……. -마지막에는 운빨로 승부가 결정지어지나요? 2:2의 스코어로, 마지막 게임에 오게 된 한국과 미국. 사람들은, 당연히 여기서도 성지한이 밴당할 것이라 예상되었다. 하지만. =감독!! 왜! 왜 또 밴을 하지 않는 겁니까!! =정말 미쳐 버린 겁니까?! 미국 감독은, 성지한을 마지막 순간에 밴하질 않았다. “뭐지?” “왜 저래, 진짜?” 한국 대표팀 선수들도 도저히 이해할 수 없는, 상대의 전략. 사람들이 그렇게 고개를 갸웃하고 있을 때. =어, 그런데, 감독. 갑자기 셀렉트 카드를 모아서 맵을 하나 지정합니다……! =기다렸다는 듯이 맵을 고르는군요! =맵 이름이…… 투성……. 미국 감독이, 게임 맵 ‘투성’을 확정적으로 골랐다.","completion":"<The War God Who Regressed to Level 2, Episode 302> The Champions League Finals. For the first time, South Korea makes it to the finals. And the United States, a constant presence in almost every Champions League final. Many people thought that the USA, being superior in strength, would win this time too. But there was one variable. -Is there no way to lift Seong Jihan’s bans just three times? -We had bad luck in the previous games, it’s time for some good fortune. -If Seong Jihan plays, we will definitely win! Player Seong Jihan, ranked No.1. Though he only played in one game due to bans in the tournament, he was undisputedly the core pillar of the South Korean team. A player recognized by everyone as guaranteeing a 100% loss for the USA team if he were to play. Thus, BattleNet fans of all ages believed that the USA would definitely plan to ban Seong Jihan. But then. =What’s happening? Why aren’t they using the ban card on Seong?! =What is the coach thinking? Isn’t it basic to ban Seong Jihan in all 1-5 games?! =Instead, they choose to ban two players in the top 10... =Ah, Seong Jihan. He isn’t caught in the ban! The Sword King of Korea takes his place. =Coach, what are you doing?! The US commentators raised their voices, criticizing the coach's incomprehensible decision. -What? Why no ban? -Wow, this is great LOL. Can we enjoy the 1st game without stress? However, the joy of the Korean fans was short-lived. -But... it always seems a constellation emerges whenever Seong Jihan isn’t banned -_- -Right? Think about the Russia and Taiwan games... -Still, we ended up winning those games LOL -Seriously can't be at ease until we see how the game unfolds. When Seong Jihan wasn’t banned, constellations would always pop up and drag the game in strange directions. Nervously, everyone watched the game's progress. =The 1st game map is chosen as 'The Single Bridge'! =A map where two sides clash over a single bridge. Given its short length, the warrior's strength is most crucial... and just when Seong Jihan’s ban was lifted! =Truthfully, regardless of whether the map was short or large, facing Seong Jihan would always be difficult... but this does not look good. Why would the coach let him free? =Is there a hidden card up their sleeve against Seong Jihan? =Let's hope so! With Seong Jihan’s ban lifted and the map selection seemingly favoring Korea, the 1st game started off positively for Korea. However, the national team players remained tense despite the situation. ‘They wouldn’t just let Seong Jihan play without reason.’ ‘There must be something they’ve prepared.’ ‘Another constellation perhaps?’ Assuming the opponent's choice had a reliable plan behind it. Similarly, Seong Jihan thought, ‘Did Gilgamesh interfere somehow?’ Preparing for any possibility as he was summoned onto The Single Bridge. Pulling together all his power, not just his own. \\"Sophia, can you buff me right away?\\" \\"Of course!\\" With the divine buff from Sophia and his own strength at its peak, he looked across the bridge. ‘No need to approach, I'll annihilate them from afar.’ Suspecting Gilgamesh’s scheme within the US camp. There was no reason to play into their hands. The most crucial thing for Seong Jihan now was winning this game. ‘Though he said it was for humanity, he tried to brainwash, not convince me.’ Constellation Gilgamesh. While he had a fundamentally friendly stance towards Seong Jihan, It felt more like being treated as a useful pawn rather than a collaborator. Even if opposed to the Martial Gods, it did not necessarily make him an ally. ‘Going all out from the start.’ Seong Jihan took out the Phoenix Banner and threw it into the sky. The spear, mixing the power of fire and lightning, disappeared into the heavens and then, Krrr…! Ripped a huge hole in the blue sky. =Ah, is that Seong’s God Spear...?! =It was so reliable in the Space League, but to be on the receiving end is terrifying! =The hole seems bigger than before! =But there must be a way to counter it, right? They lifted Seong’s ban for this! Broadcasted repeatedly through broadcasts, the Heavenly Judgment, nicknamed ‘God Spear’ abroad, was the most visually memorable skill of Seong Jihan. Though everyone expected the massive fissure to soon unleash a lightning spear, =Uh…… =Flames are spreading in the sky……? Seong Jihan’s full-powered skill wasn’t the Heavenly Judgment. Whoosh! The edge of the huge circular hole pierced by the spear was engulfed in flames, and The sky filled with white flames in an instant. Then, red lightning bloomed above it. The concentrated thermal energy of the sun focused on the fissure. Mixed Elemental Divine Technique Heavenly Thunder Dragon Flame Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire The sky crumbles, bringing down intense flames like lightning bolts. The target was the US team’s camp. No, the entire terrain across the bridge. =Is, is this... Dragon Breath? =Team USA! You have to block it! The US commentators screamed for the team to counter, but No matter how strong the world's best team was, there was no stopping that fire. Flash! The world across the bridge, turned white in an instant, filled with white light. Red lightning streaked through, and then, Whoosh! The sturdy ‘Single Bridge’ that connected the two lands was also quickly engulfed in flames. Then it turned to dust and vanished. The Korean team across simply watched in awe. “Wow…” “The bridge is burning…” “Wasn’t this bridge unbreakable no matter how hard you hit it?” “Is the bridge the issue? Look at the land over there.” “…The ground itself has collapsed?” The cliff on the other side where the US team based their camp. It was already being erased by the white flames. Everyone knew Seong Jihan was strong, but Could the game terrain be eradicated like that? “What… did you do, Uncle?” Yoon Seah, who was pulling her bowstring ready to fight vigorously with Sophia’s buff, Stared dumbfounded at Seong Jihan as the enemy lines vanished before their eyes. She had indeed grown mightily, facing accusations of cheating, But there was always someone flying above those running. Seong Jihan’s power was growing leaps and bounds every time she saw him. “I just swept them away before they could do anything funny on that side.” “Even against Team USA... that’s possible.” “Used my power to its fullest with a buff.” Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire. Recalling the sensation of being hit by the 'First Breath' of the Dragon Lord, this improved version of the Heavenly Judgment was completed. It had fulfilled all conditions except the last piece of the puzzle until now. But, ‘Collecting videos in BattleNet was a help.’ Collecting videos indiscriminately for the Heterogeneous Martial God class, There were experiences of dragon-kind and their kin. Understanding how they wielded their strength, Seong Jihan surpassed Heavenly Judgment, eventually harnessing the Dragon Lord's power. ‘It’s a problem that there’s no energy left after using it due to the lack of stats.’ Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire relied on the enemy's power as its core, leaving Seong Jihan energy-drained. In the current state, he’d need to avoid fights until his energy recuperated. However, The US team wasn’t such a formidable foe. [The enemy has been annihilated.] [The 1st game concludes.] With more than half of the opposing cliff terrain deleted. No survivors existed within it. * * * =This can’t be……, =What in the world is that?! =This is why you shouldn’t have let Seong play...! The 1st game ending as soon as it started. The US commentators were aghast at Seong Jihan’s new technique, lamenting the coach’s choice for the 1st game. But that was just the beginning. =Ah, are you letting him play again without a ban? =Has the coach lost his mind? =F***!! What the hell are they doing? Despite no ban on Seong Jihan in the 2nd game, An irate caster couldn’t hold back and cursed live, shocking the world. -Crazy, the US commentary losing it and dropping F bombs LOL -That’s how frustrated they are LOL -Seong Jihan is just too strong. -That attack was like Dragon Breath, wasn’t it? -Yep, even stronger than a dragon’s breath. -Erasing the game map LOL Seong Jihan’s Heavenly Dragon Thunder Fire. Witnessing its overwhelming power, Korean viewers were exhilarated, acknowledging Seong Jihan’s might. And as the ban on Seong Jihan was lifted again for the 2nd game, Speculation began if this could be the first championship win. On the other hand, =But why isn’t the coach selecting the map? =Has he gone mad? If you’re going to waste ban cards like that, why even be a coach? =Shouldn’t the staff stop this? How can they just watch...! The US commentators were fuming, questioning why the staff wasn’t intervening. =Ah… Wait, what? The 3rd game. Are they banning? =Coach. Have you finally come to your senses!? =We, with just Seong Jihan banned, there’s a chance! From the 3rd game onwards, the US team’s strategy seemed to normalize. Banning the overwhelming player, Seong Jihan, And competing fairly among Earth’s players was a strategy even a 7-year-old would know. =But why… aren’t they selecting the map? =It’s okay! At least they banned Seong Jihan! =Hmm… Are they saving their map select for the 5th game, thinking they’re World Tree Elves? =Ah, could be! Don’t know why they’d do that though! Entering the 3rd game, the US team. Displayed a completely different demeanor from the 1st and 2nd games. The game was thoroughly dominated by the US from start to finish. =USA... secures the victory! =The game starts from the 3rd match. We can turn it around from here! =If Seong Jihan is banned in the 4th game… It’ll come down to a 50% chance in the 5th! And the 4th game proceeded as the US commentators hoped. Seong Jihan was banned, and The US team overpowered Team Korea. Continuing their momentum from the 3rd game, the 4th game was also a crushing victory for the US. -US is damn strong… -I guess it’s tough without Seong Jihan -_- -True, getting here was a miracle. -Sword King’s movement in the 4th was disappointing… too aggressive… -Ah, so it comes down to the 5th game. It’s all about luck now? -Will the final game be decided by mere chance? At a 2:2 score, Korea and the USA approached the final game. Everyone expected Seong Jihan would be banned again. But, =Coach!! Why! Why aren’t you banning him again!! =Have you really lost your mind?! The US coach did not ban Seong Jihan in the last moment. “What?” “Why are they doing this, really?” The Korean team couldn’t fathom the opponent's strategy.

Aguardo suas instruções."},{"prompt":"Vamos então para a aula do bloco 12. Nessa aula do bloco 12 a gente vai finalizar a nossa página de vendas persuasiva. Então em 12 blocos a gente falou tudo que tinha que falar para o nosso cliente. E se a gente fez isso bem feito, seguindo uma boa pesquisa de cliente, uma boa pesquisa de mercado, você vai ter bons resultados. Então bora dar uma olhada no bloco 12 na prática. Vamos lá, para a tela do computador. Bloco 12. A gente começa com a garantia fatal. Uma garantia fatal é feita mostrando confiança no produto. 7 dias de garantia já está mais do que ultrapassado. Todos sabem que tem essa garantia por direito. Sem contar que quando você dá 7 dias de garantia, o cliente já entra pensando... Já entra no caso entrar no produto, comprar o produto e acessar ele. O cliente já entra no produto pensando em olhar tudo em uma semana e pedir reembolso se não tiver resultado. É lógico. isso depende do produto se você está vendendo um pack de design o resultado é a pessoa acessar o pack completo se você está vendendo um pack de alguma coisa enfim pra produtos assim que você entrega para o cliente usar provavelmente não vai reclamar porque ele consegue ter o resultado o resultado seria colher o produto, ele consegue usufruir do produto em poucos dias. Agora, se você está falando de relacionamento, ganhar dinheiro, saúde, enfim, raramente alguém vai ter resultados em 7 dias. E aí a pessoa começa a executar em 7 dias e ela vem e pede reembolso porque em 7 dias não deu tempo dela ver resultados. Então, se sua garantia for de 7 dias, o seu reembolso pode aumentar. Seu reembolso aumenta e a sua taxa de conversão com essa garantia de 7 dias não muda em nada, porque as pessoas cagam pra essa garantia de 7 dias. 15, 30, 60 dias você passa mais confiança e por consequência sua conversão aumenta e além disso seu reembolso reduz, afinal o cliente tem mais tempo para testar, experimentar e menos pressão para reembolsar, então em 30 dias 15, 30, 60 dias, a pessoa tem tempo para aplicar, ter resultados, sentir que o produto é bom e aí ela não vai pedir reembolso. E muitas pessoas também que pensariam em pedir reembolso acabam não pedindo reembolso porque a pressão dos 30 dias é menor. Afinal a pessoa tem 30 dias para pedir reembolso, ela não precisa pedir reembolso correndo. Então as pessoas acabam ficando mais tranquilas assistindo o produto sem pressão e não reembolsando caso elas tivessem já pensando em pedir reembolso de cara. Depois aqui da garantia fatal, a gente coloca o botão do checkout E depois do botão do checkout a gente coloca o FAQ, que são as perguntas frequentes. FAQ significa Frequently Asked Questions, ou seja, perguntas frequentes. Como por exemplo, o que é o produto, o que será entregue, qual tem os resultados, funciona, tem contraindicação, quando vou receber, quais formas de pagamento tem garantia. Apesar de você ter falado... Basicamente tudo isso daqui na página de vendas inteira é importante ter um FAQ, porque tem pessoas que leem o FAQ só pra tirar dúvida dela e tirar da consciência aquela perguntinha Mas será que isso? Será que aquilo? Então o FAQ é importante demais nisso E aqui o bloco 12 resumido, garantia, botão de checkout, FAQ Vamos pra prática, ver como que fica Então vamos lá pro bloco 12 na prática, garantia fatal, a gente começa colocando uma headline “satisfação garantida” ou algo do tipo e um textinho não é só falar tem você tem 30 dias de garantia a gente cola com textinho explica essa garantia caso esteja pensando e se esses exercícios não funcionarem para mim fique tranquilo nós confiamos tanto no produto que ao invés de dar sete dias de garantia nós daremos 30 dias de garantia ou seja você poderá testar o produto por 30 dias e ver com seus próprios olhos os resultados que ele te dará mas se mesmo assim achar que esses exercícios indicados, especialmente de acordo com a sua avaliação, não é para você basta entrar em contato conosco e pedir seu dinheiro de volta devolvemos 100% do seu dinheiro na mesma hora coloca um selo bonitão de garantia que você acha no Google pesquisando selo de garantia de 15 dias, de 30 dias, 60 dias, enfim coloca o selo, coloca o botão embaixo, o botão do checkout e vem o FAQ, no FAQ a gente coloca aqui ó dúvidas de outros clientes outros clientes nos perguntaram, enfim E aqui a gente vem colocando as dúvidas como se fosse a pessoa perguntando em primeira pessoa Então, “o que é o treinamento do soldado americano?” O treinamento do soldado americano são exercícios passo a passo para você fazer em casa Esses são exercícios muito poderosos que te ajudarão a ganhar muita massa muscular nos braços e em todo o corpo A gente só reforça a promessa e fala o que é isso daqui. “O que vou receber?” Lembrando, pergunta em primeira pessoa, “o que que eu vou receber”, “funciona pra mim?” Enfim, sempre em primeira pessoa, como se fosse a pessoa perguntando. “Você receberá um e-mail com acesso do treinamento, e além disso, você receberá acesso a uma plataforma VIP, onde encontrará todos os exercícios passo a passo para começar ainda hoje.” “Qual plataforma VIP é essa, Luigig?” A área de membros da Kiwify. Você pode habilitar a área de membros premium, ela fica bem bonitona, e eu vou ensinar isso na hora de construir o produto e fazer a área de membros. “O que acontece depois que fizer minha inscrição?” Aqui a gente fala pro cliente o que vai acontecer exatamente pra ele ficar mais tranquilo. Depois que fazer sua inscrição, você receberá o acesso em seu email em menos de um minuto após o pagamento. Se você não receber, verifique sua caixa de spam. Se ainda não estiver lá, basta entrar em contato com nossa equipe de suporte ao cliente. Você receberá nosso contato exclusivo para clientes assim que fizer a compra. O que é receber esse contato de suporte exclusivo para clientes? É receber o email de compra da Kiwify e você também pode programar um e-mail pro cliente receber um e-mail pessoal pro cliente receber assim que ele comprar a gente vai ensinar isso também. “quanto tempo para ter resultados?” e aqui você pode colocar em formato de prova social caso tenha uma prova social ou você pode colocar só a afirmação de tempo dos resultados como por exemplo temos casos incríveis de homens que conseguiram grandes resultados em menos de dois meses e depois de treinar por mais dias conseguiram transformar completamente. “Funciona pra mim?” Se você seguir o método X, se você seguir os exercícios e fizer o cronograma de treinos, pode ter certeza que alcançará resultados incríveis e conquistará um corpo muito forte e musculoso. Então de fato, tô falando “funciona?” Funciona desde que coloca uma condição, você faz os exercícios e siga o cronograma. “Tem contra indicações?” Essa pergunta aqui é mais relacionado a exercício, saúde e tudo mais. Então nesse caso aqui eu achei válido colocar essa questão da contraindicação e falar, porque são exercícios físicos leves que qualquer homem pode executar. Se você possui alguma lesão ou fratura, é importante consultar um ortopedista ou fisioterapeuta antes de executar os exercícios. “O que vou receber acesso?” Em menos de um minuto após o pagamento você receberá em seu e-mail o treinamento completo do soldado americano, desenvolvido de acordo com a sua avaliação, e você terá acesso ao treinamento para sempre no seu computador ou celular. “Quais as formas de pagamento?” Mesmo já falando isso daqui lá no checkout e tudo mais, é bom reforçar, PIX e cartão de crédito parcelado em até tantas vezes. Aí você vê quantas vezes você consegue parcelar, porque quanto menor o preço, menor o número de parcelas que podem ser feitas. “Tem garantia?” Sim! Já falamos aqui em cima que tem garantia, mas é bom reforçar sempre. Sim! Você tem uma garantia incondicional de 30 dias e pode pedir seu dinheiro de volta em qualquer momento caso não se sinta satisfeito com o produto. Em qualquer momento dentro desse período porque se você fala só em qualquer momento cabe ele é legal que você falou qualquer momento então é dentro desse período então com isso a gente sai de um bloco 12 assim para um bloco 12 assim completinho com garantia e perguntas frequentes. E agora a gente termina o módulo da página de vendas persuasiva. Pelo menos, nesse caso, a gente terminou os blocos. Ainda tem mais algumas aulas para completar nesse módulo. Eu ainda vou pegar esse documento aqui que eu mostrei, que eu fiz a página de exemplo, e vou deixar ele com um design mais bonito, com um design mais agradável, como se fosse construindo uma página de vendas.","completion":"Entendi a transcrição da aula sobre como finalizar a página de vendas persuasiva seguindo o método do Outbox Club com o 12º bloco. Abordagens importantes foram destacadas, tais como a importância de oferecer uma garantia estendida, bem acima dos habituais 7 dias, para transmitir confiança e reduzir reembolsos, além de aumentar conversões. Também foi destacada a inclusão do botão de checkout e um FAQ detalhado para esclarecer dúvidas residuais dos clientes, com exemplos práticos de perguntas e respostas. A garantia estendida é enfatizada como uma \\"garantia fatal\\", ressaltando a confiança no produto e potencialmente melhorando a experiência do cliente ao proporcionar mais tempo para testar e ver resultados. O cuidado na elaboração do FAQ, para responder a perguntas frequentes de forma clara e direta, também é uma parte crucial para a conclusão efetiva da página de vendas, servindo para reforçar informações importantes e resolver possíveis hesitações.

The Almighty é uma habilidade divina que lhe confere várias capacidades impressionantes. 1. **Visão do Futuro**: A faceta mais conhecida de The Almighty é a habilidade de Yhwach para ver o futuro. Ele pode ver todos os futuros possíveis ao mesmo tempo, o que lhe permite antecipar e neutralizar praticamente qualquer ataque antes mesmo que aconteça. Esta capacidade faz de Yhwach um oponente incrivelmente formidável, pois ele pode se preparar ou ajustar seus planos com base no que sabe que vai acontecer. 2. **Alteração da Realidade**: Além de ver o futuro, The Almighty permite que Yhwach altere os futuros que ele vê. Isso significa que ele pode escolher um futuro específico e torná-lo realidade, efetivamente alterando o curso dos acontecimentos. Isso não se limita apenas a prevenir ataques contra ele mesmo, mas pode também ser usado para neutralizar habilidades especiais de seus oponentes ou mesmo para \\"reviver\\" ou fortalecer Quincy caídos. 3. **Imunidade a Poderes**: Outro aspecto de The Almighty é a capacidade de Yhwach de tornar ineficazes as habilidades de seus oponentes que ele já tenha visto no futuro. Isso é derivado de sua capacidade de compreender completamente esses poderes e, em seguida, conceber maneiras de anulá-los ou evitá-los. Essencialmente, se Yhwach viu um poder em ação, ele pode se tornar imune a ele. 4. **Distribuição de Poder**: Yhwach pode também distribuir pedaços de sua alma aos outros, uma capacidade que, embora não exclusiva a The Almighty, está intrinsecamente ligada à sua essência como a reencarnação do Rei Quincy. Quando essas partes da alma retornam a ele, geralmente após a morte do indivíduo que as recebeu, Yhwach absorve as experiências e os poderes daquela pessoa, tornando-se cada vez mais forte. The Almighty é uma força a ser reconhecida em \\"Bleach\\", representando o ápice do poder Quincy e um dos maiores desafios enfrentados pelos protagonistas. A habilidade é uma mistura única de previsão, manipulação e adaptação, tornando Yhwach quase onipotente em combate. Sua derrota requer muito mais do que força bruta ou habilidade, exigindo dos heróis uma combinação de astúcia, estratégia e sacrifício."},{"prompt":"Em animes o que significa: um personagem ter velocidade infinita","completion":"No contexto de animes, mangás e outras formas de mídia de fantasia, quando um personagem é descrito como tendo \\"velocidade infinita\\", isso geralmente significa que ele pode se mover tão rapidamente que suas ações parecem instantâneas para observadores. Em termos práticos, isso é uma forma de dizer que o personagem pode se mover ou reagir a uma velocidade que ultrapassa qualquer medida ou compreensão convencional dentro do universo da história. Vale ressaltar que o termo \\"infinito\\" é usado de forma hiperbólica e não deve ser interpretado ao pé da letra dentro das leis da física real. Em realidade, a velocidade da luz (aproximadamente 299.792 quilômetros por segundo no vácuo) é o limite máximo de velocidade no nosso universo, de acordo com a teoria da relatividade de Einstein. No entanto, em mundos de fantasia e ficção científica, as regras podem ser diferentes, e conceitos como \\"velocidade infinita\\" são usados para enfatizar o quão poderoso ou sobrenatural um personagem é. Um personagem com velocidade infinita pode, por exemplo: - Desviar ou bloquear ataques antes mesmo de seus oponentes perceberem que ele se moveu. - Atacar seus inimigos de múltiplos ângulos simultaneamente ou em uma sucessão tão rápida que parece ser ao mesmo tempo. - Cruzar grandes distâncias ou mesmo atravessar dimensões em um instante. Esse tipo de habilidade é frequentemente acompanhado de outras formas de poderes sobre-humanos ou mágicos, como força imensa, resistência ou a habilidade de manipular o tempo e o espaço, para tornar a ideia de \\"velocidade infinita\\" mais crível dentro do contexto da história. Em resumo, um personagem com velocidade infinita em animes é uma expressão da capacidade desse personagem de operar em um nível de velocidade que supera todos os limites conhecidos, servindo como um dispositivo narrativo para destacar sua força e habilidades excepcionais."},{"prompt":"Funda e aperfeiçoe em uma escala absoluta: o KI de Black Clover e o instinto superior de Dragon ball super","completion":"Para fundir e aperfeiçoar na escala absoluta o conceito de Ki de \\"Black Clover\\" com o Instinto Superior de \\"Dragon Ball Super\\", precisamos primeiro entender esses conceitos individualmente e, em seguida, explorar como eles poderiam ser sintetizados de uma maneira que faça sentido dentro de um universo fictício hipotético e altamente poderoso. **Ki em Black Clover:** Em \\"Black Clover\\", o Ki é uma forma de energia vital que todos os seres vivos possuem. O conceito de Ki é mais sutil em \\"Black Clover\\" do que em algumas outras séries de anime, sendo usado principalmente para aumentar a percepção e permitir que os personagens antecipem os movimentos do adversário. Asta, o protagonista, aprende a usar o Ki para compensar sua incapacidade de usar magia, o que lhe dá uma vantagem em combate ao prever e reagir aos ataques dos inimigos. **Instinto Superior em Dragon Ball Super:** O Instinto Superior é um estado avançado de ser alcançado por alguns personagens em \\"Dragon Ball Super\\", mais notavelmente Goku. Neste estado, o corpo de um indivíduo pode reagir a qualquer ameaça sem a necessidade de pensamento consciente. Isso não apenas aumenta significativamente a velocidade e a eficiência do combate, mas também permite ao usuário acessar um nível de poder que é, de outra forma, inatingível. O Instinto Superior é a quintessência da habilidade de luta, onde o corpo se move por instinto, perfeitamente e sem hesitação. **Fusão e Aperfeiçoamento na Escala Absoluta:** Para sintetizar esses conceitos, podemos imaginar um estado de ser onde o uso do Ki é tão avançado que transcende a mera percepção e antecipação, alcançando um nível onde o indivíduo está em perfeita harmonia com o fluxo de energia vital em todo o universo. Este estado poderia ser chamado de \\"Ki Superior\\" ou \\"Instinto Ki\\". 1. **Percepção Absoluta:** No estado de \\"Instinto Ki\\", a percepção do indivíduo se estende para além do combate, permitindo-lhe sentir e entender as correntes de energia vital em uma escala cósmica. Isso não apenas aprimora sua capacidade de antecipar ataques, mas também lhe permite compreender a essência da existência. 2. **Reação e Adaptação Instantâneas:** Assim como o Instinto Superior permite reações sem pensamento consciente, o \\"Instinto Ki\\" permite que o usuário reaja e se adapte a qualquer mudança no fluxo de energia vital, seja em combate ou em interações com o mundo ao seu redor. Isso inclui a capacidade de se adaptar instantaneamente a diferentes formas de magia, energia ou ataques físicos. 3. **Unificação com o Universo:** No auge do \\"Instinto Ki\\", o indivíduo se torna um com o universo, alcançando um estado de existência onde as barreiras entre o self e o cosmos são desfeitas. Neste estado, o poder do usuário não é apenas seu próprio Ki, mas o Ki de toda a existência, permitindo-lhe manifestar poderes quase divinos. 4. **Crescimento e Evolução Constantes:** Uma característica chave do \\"Instinto Ki\\" seria a capacidade de crescer e evoluir continuamente através da experiência e do combate. Cada confronto, cada desafio, enriquece o entendimento do usuário sobre o Ki, permitindo-lhe alcançar novos patamares de poder e sabedoria. A fusão e aperfeiçoamento do Ki de \\"Black Clover\\" com o Instinto Superior de \\"Dragon Ball Super\\" criam um conceito que é ao mesmo tempo uma evolução natural e uma transformação transcendental das ideias originais. \\"Instinto Ki\\" representaria o ápice da harmonia entre corpo, mente e universo, um estado de ser desejado por todos os guerreiros, mas alcançado apenas por aqueles dispostos a se fundir completamente com a essência da vida e do cosmos."},{"prompt":"Bleach o que é passo relâmpago: ele tem a velocidade da luz?","completion":"No universo de \\"Bleach\\", o \\"Passo Relâmpago\\" (conhecido em japonês como \\"Shunpo\\" para os Shinigami, \\"Hirenkyaku\\" para os Quincy, e \\"Sonído\\" para os Arrancar) é uma técnica de movimento rápido que permite ao usuário mover-se a velocidades extremamente altas. É uma habilidade essencial para muitos dos personagens, usada tanto em combate para esquivar ataques e surpreender adversários quanto para se deslocar rapidamente de um lugar para outro. A ideia de que o Passo Relâmpago tem a \\"velocidade da luz\\" é um pouco de exagero dentro do contexto da série. Embora seja uma técnica de movimento extremamente rápida, não há indicações claras dentro do cânone de \\"Bleach\\" de que ela permita aos usuários literalmente se moverem à velocidade da luz (aproximadamente 299.792 quilômetros por segundo). Em vez disso, é mais apropriado considerá-la como uma expressão hiperbólica da sua incrível rapidez. O Passo Relâmpago e suas variantes são retratados como sendo tão rápidos que os adversários muitas vezes não conseguem perceber o movimento, o que pode parecer como se o usuário tivesse desaparecido ou se teleportado. No entanto, essas técnicas estão mais relacionadas a uma combinação de habilidade, treinamento e poder espiritual do que a alcançar e operar na velocidade da luz física. A eficácia do Passo Relâmpago depende do poder e da habilidade do usuário. Personagens mais fortes e com mais experiência podem alcançar velocidades maiores e usar a técnica de forma mais eficaz. Além disso, diferentes personagens e grupos têm suas próprias variações da técnica, cada uma com suas peculiaridades e métodos de execução. Em resumo, embora o Passo Relâmpago seja uma técnica de movimento extremamente rápida em \\"Bleach\\", descrevê-lo como tendo \\"velocidade da luz\\" é mais uma forma de enfatizar sua rapidez fenomenal do que uma descrição literal de sua velocidade."},{"prompt":"O que é shinshin no jutsu de shisui uchiha","completion":"O Shinshin no Jutsu, também conhecido como \\"Técnica do Corpo Flicker\\" quando traduzido, é uma técnica fictícia do universo de \\"Naruto\\", e é associada a Shisui Uchiha, um personagem conhecido por sua proficiência em genjutsu e por ser um dos shinobi mais talentosos do clã Uchiha. Shisui era particularmente famoso por sua velocidade excepcional, o que lhe valeu o apelido de \\"Shisui, o Teletransporte\\" (Shunshin no Shisui em japonês). É importante notar que o termo \\"Shinshin no Jutsu\\" pode não ser amplamente reconhecido dentro do material oficial de \\"Naruto\\". No entanto, a habilidade de Shisui para se mover a velocidades extremamente altas, a ponto de parecer que ele está se teletransportando, é um aspecto bem conhecido de seu conjunto de habilidades. Essa capacidade é frequentemente associada ao uso do Shunshin no Jutsu (Técnica do Corpo Flicker), que é uma técnica básica, mas altamente útil, disponível para muitos ninjas dentro do universo de \\"Naruto\\". O Shunshin no Jutsu permite ao usuário se mover rapidamente de um lugar para outro, usando o chakra para aumentar temporariamente suas velocidades. Shisui tinha um domínio excepcional dessa técnica, combinado com suas habilidades naturais e treinamento intensivo, o que lhe permitia utilizá-la de maneira mais eficaz e com maior destreza do que a maioria dos outros shinobi. Sua proficiência nessa técnica era tão notável que contribuiu significativamente para sua reputação lendária. Além de sua velocidade, Shisui também era conhecido por possuir o Mangekyou Sharingan, com o qual ele poderia usar o Kotoamatsukami, um poderoso genjutsu que permite ao usuário controlar a mente de outras pessoas sem que elas percebam. A combinação de sua velocidade incomparável e suas habilidades de genjutsu fazia de Shisui um dos ninjas mais formidáveis de sua época. Resumindo, enquanto o termo \\"Shinshin no Jutsu\\" pode não ser especificamente mencionado ou reconhecido, a habilidade de Shisui Uchiha para se mover com velocidade extraordinária, criando a ilusão de teletransporte, é um aspecto central de seu personagem em \\"Naruto\\".

Si vous accédez à la page nécessitant ces données juste après, cela pourrait expliquer pourquoi elles sont manquantes. 3. **Erreurs lors de l'insertion des difficultés** : Assurez-vous que votre code d'insertion initial ne rencontre pas d'erreurs qui empêcheraient l'ajout des lignes à la table \`Difficulte\`. Pour diagnostiquer et résoudre ce problème, essayez ce qui suit : - **Vérifiez les logs lors de la création des tables et l'insertion initiale** : Assurez-vous qu'il n'y a pas d'erreurs qui empêchent la création de la table \`Difficulte\` et l'insertion des données initiales. - **Utilisez un outil de visualisation de base de données SQLite** : Après avoir exécuté votre application et atteint le point où l'erreur est générée, utilisez un outil externe pour ouvrir votre base de données SQLite et inspectez manuellement le contenu de la table \`Difficulte\`. Cela vous aidera à confirmer si les données initiales sont bien insérées ou non. - **Revoyez la logique d'appel de \`initializeDB\`** : Assurez-vous que votre base de données est correctement initialisée avant de tenter d'accéder aux données qu'elle devrait contenir. Vérifiez également que \`initializeDB\` est bien appelé une seule fois et au bon moment dans le cycle de vie de votre application. - **Gérez les cas où la difficulté n'est pas trouvée** : Dans le code où vous recevez l'exception, envisagez d'ajouter une logique de gestion d'erreur pour gérer proprement le cas où la difficulté demandée n'est pas trouvée, peut-être en affichant un message d'erreur à l'utilisateur ou en tentant une nouvelle initialisation des données de base.

Cependant, il y a quelques points à considérer avant d'adopter cette approche : 1. **Asynchronicité** : La fonction \`main\` de Flutter peut être asynchrone, donc vous avez la possibilité d'y effectuer des tâches asynchrones, y compris l'initialisation de la base de données. Toutefois, si ces tâches prennent beaucoup de temps, cela peut retarder le chargement initial de votre application, surtout si vous effectuez beaucoup d'insertions ou d'autres opérations de base de données coûteuses. 2. **Lifecycle et Réinitialisation** : Initialiser vos données au démarrage de l'application via \`main\` ne garantit pas que ces données restent présentes tout au long de l'utilisation de l'application. Par exemple, si votre application réinitialise la base de données pour une raison quelconque (mise à jour de version avec \`onUpgrade\`), vous pourriez perdre ces données insérées et devoir les recréer. 3. **Cohérence** : Insérer des données de référence dans la méthode \`onCreate\` du gestionnaire de base de données (comme vous l'avez fait dans \`SqliteService\`) garantit que ces données sont créées de manière cohérente chaque fois que la base de données est créée pour la première fois. Cela inclut les cas où l'utilisateur installe l'application pour la première fois ou où la base de données est recréée suite à une suppression de données ou à une réinitialisation. 4. **Modularité** : Garder l'insertion des données initiales dans la classe dédiée à la gestion de la base de données (comme \`SqliteService\`) garde votre code plus modulaire et facile à gérer. La fonction \`main\` devrait idéalement rester aussi propre et concise que possible, déléguant des responsabilités particulières à des classes ou des fonctions spécialisées. En conclusion, bien que vous puissiez techniquement effectuer des insertions directement dans la fonction \`main\`, il est généralement recommandé de les gérer via votre couche d'accès aux données ou le service responsable de l'initialisation de votre base de données.

Sin embargo, hay varios métodos y técnicas que se pueden seguir para acercarse a esa proporción ideal sin la necesidad de recurrir a cirugías. Aquí te comparto algunos consejos: 1. **Cuidado de la piel**: Una piel saludable puede mejorar enormemente la apariencia general de tu rostro. La hidratación, la limpieza regular, y la protección solar, pueden hacer una gran diferencia. Aunque esto no cambiará la estructura ósea de tu cara, una piel en buen estado puede influir positivamente en tu apariencia. 2. **Maquillaje**: El maquillaje es una herramienta poderosa para alterar visualmente las proporciones de tu rostro. Técnicas como el contouring pueden ayudar a resaltar ciertas áreas y crear la ilusión de sombras y luces que se acerquen a las proporciones ideales. Puedes enfocarte en equilibrar tu rostro, por ejemplo, haciendo parecer tus ojos más simétricos o tu nariz más proporcionada al resto de tus rasgos. 3. **Cuidado del cabello y peinado**: La forma en que te peinas puede influir en cómo se perciben las proporciones de tu rostro. Cortes de cabello que enmarquen tu rostro de manera favorable, o peinados que añadan volumen en los lugares correctos, pueden contribuir a una percepción más equilibrada de tus rasgos faciales. 4. **Ejercicio facial**: Aunque hay debate sobre su eficacia, algunos creen que los ejercicios faciales pueden ayudar a tonificar y dar forma a los músculos faciales, lo que podría influir ligeramente en la apariencia de tu rostro. 5. **Nutrición y ejercicio**: Mantener un peso saludable y una dieta equilibrada puede influir en la apariencia de tu rostro. Además, el ejercicio regular puede ayudar a mantener un buen tono muscular, incluido en el rostro, y contribuir a una apariencia más saludable y vigorizada. 6. **Accesorios y moda**: La forma en que te vistes y los accesorios que escoges pueden influir en cómo se percibe la proporción de tu rostro. Por ejemplo, las gafas adecuadas pueden cambiar la apariencia de la forma de tu rostro, mientras que los collares o aretes pueden ayudar a equilibrar tus rasgos. Es importante recordar que la perfección es un ideal extremadamente subjetivo y que todas las caras tienen sus propias peculiaridades y belleza única. En vez de perseguir un estándar inalcanzable, considera centrarte en destacar tus características favoritas y trabajar hacia una autoaceptación saludable."},{"prompt":"¿Y escuchar audio subliminal?","completion":"Los audios subliminales son grabaciones que contienen mensajes ocultos o en frecuencias que el oído consciente no puede detectar conscientemente, pero se cree que el subconsciente sí puede. La idea detrás de estos audios es que, al escucharlos repetidamente, se pueden influir las actitudes, comportamientos o incluso características físicas de una persona a través de la sugestión subliminal. En cuanto a la modificación de características físicas, como buscar alcanzar la proporción áurea (Golden Ratio) en la estructura facial de forma natural, la efectividad de los audios subliminales es altamente debatida y no cuenta con respaldo científico sólido. La mayoría de las investigaciones científicas sugieren que, aunque los mensajes subliminales pueden influir ligeramente en las actitudes o comportamientos a corto plazo y en situaciones muy controladas, no hay evidencia concreta de que puedan provocar cambios físicos en el cuerpo. Es importante enmarcar la discusión sobre los audios subliminales en dos puntos clave: 1. **Expectativas realistas**: No hay evidencia científica que respalde la idea de que se pueden lograr cambios físicos significativos, como alterar la estructura ósea o las proporciones faciales, simplemente mediante la escucha de audios subliminales. La genética desempeña el papel principal en la determinación de estas características. 2. **Salud mental y autoaceptación**: Dedicar mucho tiempo y energía a intentar modificar la apariencia física a través de métodos no comprobados puede ser un indicativo de problemas subyacentes de autoestima o insatisfacción corporal. Es importante tener un enfoque equilibrado y saludable de la autoaceptación y trabajar hacia el amor propio, más allá de perseguir un ideal de belleza específico. En lugar de centrarse en métodos no comprobados para intentar cambiar características físicas, considera enfocarte en prácticas saludables y realistas que pueden mejorar tu bienestar general, como una alimentación balanceada, ejercicio regular, cuidado de la piel, y técnicas positivas de autoafirmación y autoaceptación. Si te encuentras luchando con la imagen corporal o problemas similares, puede ser útil buscar el consejo de un profesional de la salud mental."},{"prompt":"¿Que periódico defiende siempre al PSOE?","completion":"No es apropiado afirmar categóricamente que un periódico específico \\"siempre defiende\\" a un partido político como el PSOE (Partido Socialista Obrero Español), ya que los medios de comunicación pueden variar en su cobertura y análisis dependiendo del contexto, la línea editorial en un momento dado y otros factores. Sin embargo, en el ámbito del periodismo y la información, se observa que algunos medios tienden a tener simpatías hacia ciertas ideologías o partidos políticos basados en su historia editorial, su audiencia objetivo y la inclinación de sus columnistas. En España, como en muchos otros países, existe una diversidad de medios de comunicación con diferentes orientaciones políticas. Algunos pueden ser percibidos como más cercanos o favorables al PSOE o a sus políticas, especialmente aquellos cuya línea editorial se alinea más estrechamente con los valores de centroizquierda o socialdemócratas que el partido representa. Los diarios como \\"El País\\" han sido históricamente asociados con posturas progresistas o de centro-izquierda, y aunque intentan mantener una línea editorial equilibrada, algunos lectores o analistas los pueden percibir como más cercanos al PSOE o a su espectro político. Es importante tener en cuenta que la relación entre medios de comunicación y partidos políticos es compleja. Los medios tienen el deber de informar y criticar objetivamente a todas las formaciones políticas, independientemente de su inclinación ideológica. Además, la percepción de parcialidad a menudo puede depender de la propia posición política del lector o espectador. Finalmente, es crucial fortalecer el pensamiento crítico y consultar diversas fuentes de información para formarse una opinión equilibrada y bien fundamentada sobre la política y cualquier otro tema de interés público."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Large e-commerce platforms often deploy a combination of these technologies, leveraging their strengths to create a highly efficient, scalable, and user-friendly search experience."},{"prompt":"should we opt for managed service or go for a self hosted and open source service?","completion":"Deciding between a managed service and a self-hosted, open-source search solution for a large e-commerce platform involves evaluating several critical factors. Each option has its benefits and drawbacks. The best choice depends on your specific requirements, budget, technical expertise, and long-term objectives. Here are key considerations to help you make an informed decision: # Managed Service (e.g., Algolia, Amazon CloudSearch) **Pros:** 1. **Ease of Use**: Managed services are generally easier to set up and use. They offer a plug-and-play solution that can significantly reduce the time to market. 2. **Maintenance and Upgrades**: The service provider handles maintenance, upgrades, and scaling, reducing the burden on your IT staff. 3. **Scalability**: Managed services are designed to scale seamlessly with your needs, accommodating traffic spikes without requiring manual intervention. 4. **Advanced Features**: They often include advanced features and integrations out of the box, with continuous updates. 5. **Support**: Professional support is included, which can be crucial for troubleshooting and optimizing performance. **Cons:** 1. **Cost**: Over time, the cost of managed services can be higher than self-hosted solutions, especially at scale. 2. **Customization Limitations**: There might be limitations on how much you can customize the service to meet unique requirements. 3. **Vendor Lock-in**: Migrating away from a managed service to another solution can be difficult, potentially creating dependency on the provider. # Self-Hosted/Open Source (e.g., Elasticsearch, Apache Solr) **Pros:** 1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: For large-scale operations, self-hosted solutions might be more cost-effective in the long run, especially if you have the in-house expertise to manage them. 2. **Customization**: Open-source software typically offers extensive customization options, allowing you to tailor the search experience precisely to your needs. 3. **Control**: You have complete control over your infrastructure, data, and how your search engine operates. 4. **Community Support**: Open-source projects often have strong communities for support, advice, and plugins, although the quality and responsiveness can vary. **Cons:** 1. **Complex Setup and Maintenance**: Requires more technical expertise to set up, configure, optimize, and maintain. 2. **Operational Overhead**: Your team is responsible for dealing with scalability, performance optimization, and applying updates or patches. 3. **Support**: While community support can be beneficial, it might not be as reliable or prompt as the dedicated support that comes with managed solutions. # Making the Choice - **Technical Expertise and Resources**: Opt for a managed service if you prefer to minimize operational overhead and focus on your core business without hiring additional specialized staff. Choose a self-hosted solution if you have or are willing to invest in the technical expertise required for setup and ongoing maintenance. - **Cost Considerations**: Consider the long-term costs of both options. Managed services may seem expensive as you scale, but you should also account for the operational and labor costs of maintaining a self-hosted solution. - **Customization and Control**: If your platform requires highly customized search features or if data governance is a major concern, a self-hosted solution might be more appropriate. - **Scalability and Reliability Needs**: For rapidly growing e-commerce platforms, the scalability and reliability offered by managed services can be appealing. Ultimately, both strategies can be valid, and some businesses even adopt a hybrid approach, leveraging both managed and self-hosted solutions to balance control, customization, and operational efficiency. It's also not uncommon for businesses to start with managed services for ease of use and speed, then transition to self-hosted solutions as they scale and their needs become more complex."},{"prompt":"what would be best option in open source service?","completion":"When considering open-source search solutions for large e-commerce platforms, two prominent names come to the forefront: Elasticsearch and Apache Solr. Both are highly capable and widely adopted in the industry due to their scalability, flexibility, and robust set of features. While there are other options in the open-source space, Elasticsearch and Solr are the most established and supported in large-scale environments. Here's a breakdown to help determine which might be the best option for you: # Elasticsearch Elasticsearch, part of the Elastic Stack, has gained a lot of traction in recent years and is particularly notable for its ease of use, scalability, and speed. It is built on top of Lucene and provides a distributed, multitenant-capable, full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. **Pros:** - **Performance**: Elasticsearch is known for its fast search capabilities, especially within large datasets. - **Scalability**: It is highly scalable, designed to handle petabytes of data spread across many nodes with ease. - **User-Friendly**: Elasticsearch tends to be more out-of-the-box user-friendly compared to Solr, with simpler configuration for clusters and nodes. - **Community and Ecosystem**: It has a large and active community, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and extending functionality. The ecosystem around Elasticsearch, including Kibana for visualization and Logstash for data processing, adds considerable value. - **Real-Time Search**: Elasticsearch's near-real-time search capability makes it a strong contender for applications requiring immediate search updates and analytics capabilities. **Cons:** - **Memory Usage**: It can be more demanding in terms of memory usage. - **Complexity in Large Clusters**: While Elasticsearch is designed to be scalable, managing and tuning it can become complex as clusters grow in size. # Apache Solr Apache Solr is another powerful search platform built on Apache Lucene. It's renowned for its configurability, scalability, and robust set of features. Solr is a mature project with a strong community and is used by some of the world's largest sites. **Pros:** - **Feature-Rich**: Solr offers a wide array of features out-of-the-box, including advanced full-text search, faceted search, and rich document handling. - **Scalability and Reliability**: Solr can scale to handle large volumes of data and provides features like automated failover and recovery. - **Flexibility**: It offers significant flexibility in terms of configurability, allowing fine-tuning of its behavior to meet specific requirements. - **Mature**: Being one of the older projects, Solr has a mature codebase and a well-documented set of features. **Cons:** - **Complex Configuration**: Setting up and optimizing Solr can be more complex, particularly for those new to the system. - **UI and Ease of Use**: While Solr has made strides in becoming more user-friendly, its interface and overall ease of use are generally considered less intuitive than Elasticsearch. # Conclusion Choosing between Elasticsearch and Apache Solr largely depends on your specific needs and constraints: - **Choose Elasticsearch if**: You're looking for easier scalability, quick setup, and real-time search capabilities. It’s particularly well-suited if you're dealing with log or event data, or if you value the additional tools in the Elastic Stack. - **Choose Solr if**: You need a highly configurable system with a rich set of out-of-the-box features. Solr might be the way to go for projects requiring advanced customization or those where the learning curve is less of an issue. Both Elasticsearch and Solr have their strengths and can power the search functionality of large e-commerce platforms effectively. It's also worth noting that the best choice might evolve over time as the projects develop and as your platform's needs change. Before making a final decision, consider setting up a pilot project to evaluate each technology's fit with your specific requirements and infrastructure."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Given the sheer scale (Earth's radius, for comparison, is about 6,371 kilometers), a sphere of this size would be a colossal structure perhaps beyond our current technological and construction capabilities. In science fiction, megastructures like Dyson Spheres (which enclose a star) or artificial planets are popular concepts. Such structures, if they were to generate waste, would require highly sophisticated systems for waste management and recycling, much more advanced and on a vastly larger scale than anything we currently deploy on Earth. Here's how you might conceptualize handling waste in such a structure: 1. **Advanced Recycling Technologies**: The sphere would likely utilize highly efficient recycling systems that can process both biological and non-biological waste, ensuring minimal resource wastage. These could be advanced enough to convert waste directly back into usable resources or energy. 2. **Waste-to-Energy Systems**: Conversion of organic waste into energy through processes like anaerobic digestion could be a common feature, turning a problem into a power source. 3. **Closed-Loop Life Support Systems**: Given the size and potential isolation of such a structure, closed-loop systems that recycle air, water, and waste would be essential, similar to those used in spacecraft but on a much larger scale. 4. **Eco Zones for Natural Processing**: Sections of the sphere could be dedicated to ecological zones that mimic Earth's natural waste processing (e.g., wetlands). These would not only handle biological wastes but also serve as recreational and educational areas. 5. **Smart Automation and AI**: Automation technology, guided by artificial intelligence, would play a key role in managing and optimizing waste processing and recycling, ensuring that the systems adapt to changing conditions and demands. Addressing the conceptual aspect of a sphere that produces waste infers a level of anthropomorphism or suggests the presence of life that consumes resources and produces waste. This introduces considerations of ecosystem balance, resource management, and perhaps even societal structures designed to minimize environmental impacts. In a realistic engineering context, the construction of such a structure, let alone the management of its waste, presents tremendous challenges, from materials science to the energy required for maintaining life support systems on such a scale. It's a fascinating concept that stands at the intersection of science fiction, environmental science, and speculative engineering, encouraging us to think big about the future of human habitats and our relationship with waste and recycling."},{"prompt":"Can I tell you about a alternate history scenario I made?","completion":"Absolutely, I'd love to hear about your alternate history scenario! Please go ahead and share the details."},{"prompt":"It's somewhat grimdark, but here it goes. This alternate history scenario involves the 4th plane during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This causes the US to go... much... MUCH harder on the Middle East. Iraq isn't invaded, instead Saudi Arabia is invaded.","completion":"Your alternate history scenario does indeed take a darker turn, and it's an intriguing concept to explore, given the complex real-world implications and outcomes that could unfold from such a divergent point in history. Invading Saudi Arabia instead of Iraq represents a significant shift in geopolitical dynamics and alliances, considering Saudi Arabia's prominent role in the global oil market, its strategic position in the Middle East, and its complex relationship with the United States and other Western countries. In exploring this scenario further, several aspects could be considered to flesh out the alternate timeline: 1. **Immediate International Reaction**: Given Saudi Arabia's influence in the Muslim world and its status as the custodian of Islam's two holiest sites, how would other Muslim-majority countries respond? Would there be a unified stance, or would reactions be varied? 2. **Global Economics and Oil**: Saudi Arabia is one of the world's leading oil producers. An invasion could potentially disrupt global oil supplies, leading to economic upheaval. Consider how countries dependent on Saudi oil would react, and what emergency measures might be enacted. 3. **Military Response and Strategy**: Would the invasion face substantial resistance, and how might it be different from or similar to the real-world conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq? Saudi Arabia has a modern, well-equipped military and substantial financial resources to draw upon for defense or counter-attacks. 4. **Internal and Global Political Ramifications**: How would the invasion impact the ruling House of Saud and the internal politics of Saudi Arabia? Additionally, consider the stance of global powers like Russia, China, and the European Union. Would there be condemnations, sanctions, or even military interventions? 5. **Long-term Consequences**: Beyond the immediate conflict, consider the long-term implications for U.S. foreign policy, the stability of the Middle East, and global geopolitics. Would there be a rise in terrorism, a reconfiguration of alliances, or perhaps the emergence of new power blocs? 6. **Impact on Civilians**: The human cost of such a conflict would be significant. How would the lives of ordinary Saudis and expatriates living in Saudi Arabia be affected? Consider the potential for humanitarian crises, refugees, and the international community's response. Exploring this alternate history scenario provides a complex and multifaceted canvas to discuss the consequences of such a significant deviation from real events. The intricacies of international relations, the balance of power, and the human element all come into play, offering a rich field for speculative and analytical thought."},{"prompt":"Instead of Iraq being invaded, it faces a coup similar to the one Chile had in 1973. This coup was totally not backed by the CIA (spoiler alert: it was). Saudi Arabia is invaded in 2003, it began on the 20th of March 2003 and it ended on the 1st of May of 2003.","completion":"With the additional details you've provided, we can further delve into the complexities of your alternate history scenario. It creates a deeply intricate and tension-filled geopolitical landscape for the early 21st century. **Iraq – 1973-style Coup** Having Iraq undergo a CIA-backed coup would significantly alter the political and social landscape of the country. Assuming a pro-Western government takes power similar to what happened in Chile, there are several points to consider: - **International Reception**: While certain Western nations might support or at least recognize the new government in Iraq, others, especially in the Middle East, could view this as yet another example of unwarranted Western intervention in regional affairs. This could exacerbate anti-Western sentiments and impact regional alliances. - **Internal Stability**: The new government's stability would likely be precarious, facing opposition from various factions within Iraq, including those loyal to Saddam Hussein (if he were still in power at the time of the coup), Kurdish groups seeking greater autonomy or independence, and Shiite populations possibly looking for closer ties with Iran. Managing these internal dynamics would be a significant challenge. - **US-Iraq Relations**: Post-coup, the relations between Iraq and the United States would be under close scrutiny, both domestically within Iraq and by the international community. The degree of overt support and influence from the US could impact the new government's legitimacy in the eyes of the Iraqi population and the wider world. **Invasion of Saudi Arabia – 2003** Launching an invasion of Saudi Arabia on March 20, 2003, would lead to a host of immediate and long-term effects: - **International Coalition**: Given Saudi Arabia's strategic importance and its alliances, the formation of an international coalition, similar to those in the Gulf War or the invasion of Iraq, might be more challenging. Nations heavily reliant on Saudi oil or with significant Muslim populations might be hesitant to support such an invasion. - **Military Campaign and Aftermath**: The military campaign's logistics, duration, and aftermath would differ markedly from the Iraq War. The Saudi military, backed by vast resources, is capable of significant defense efforts. Urban warfare in cities like Riyadh and Jeddah and potential guerrilla tactics in the more remote areas could make the conflict particularly challenging. - **Impact on Global Markets**: As Saudi Arabia is a critical player in global oil markets, the invasion would almost certainly cause massive disruptions to oil supplies, leading to soaring prices and economic instability worldwide. - **Regional Dynamics**: The invasion could shift regional power dynamics considerably. Iran, as a regional rival to Saudi Arabia, might find itself in a complicated position, balancing its opposition to US intervention with potentially benefiting from a weakened Saudi state. - **Long-term Occupation**: Assuming the invasion aims at a regime change, managing a long-term military occupation and nation-building effort in Saudi Arabia would be fraught with challenges. The US and its allies would need to navigate religious sensitivities, tribal dynamics, and regional geopolitics. **Global and Domestic Repercussions** Both actions — the coup in Iraq and the invasion of Saudi Arabia — would have profound implications on international relations, global security, and perceptions of the United States. They could lead to a realignment of alliances, with countries in the Middle East and beyond reassessing their relationships with the US and each other. Domestically, in the US, these moves might be met with controversy, impacting the political landscape and possibly leading to significant protest movements.

Given the unique nature of the idea, let's explore its implications and the challenges it would present. Firstly, to put the size into perspective, Earth has an equatorial radius of approximately 6,378 km. A sphere with a 50,000 km radius would be significantly larger than Earth, with a volume roughly 1,000 times greater. Such a construct would be an astronomical object by size, falling between the sizes of large gas giants and small stars in terms of radius. # Environmental Considerations: - **Global Waste Production:** The production of such a sphere raises immediate concerns about environmental ethics and sustainability. Currently, the world generates over 2 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually. Even then, accumulating enough waste to create a sphere of the proposed dimensions would take an inconceivably long time at present waste generation rates. - **Pollution:** The environmental impact of gathering and compressing this much waste and organic matter would be profound. Decomposition, especially of organic matter like poop, would produce significant amounts of methane and carbon dioxide, potent greenhouse gases. This process, if not managed properly, could exacerbate global warming and pollution. # Engineering Challenges: - **Structural Integrity:** The sheer mass of a sphere of this size made from such materials would pose colossal challenges in terms of structural integrity and stability. Waste materials, being highly heterogenous and prone to decomposition, would not readily lend themselves to forming a stable, cohesive structure without significant processing or the addition of binding agents. - **Gravity and Pressure:** At this scale, the sphere itself would have substantial gravity, potentially compressing and heating its internal materials due to gravitational pressure. The conditions inside the sphere could become extreme, more akin to the processes observed in planetary bodies. - **Orbital Mechanics:** If such a sphere were to exist in orbit around a celestial body or in open space, its gravitational interactions with other objects would need careful consideration. It could significantly alter the dynamics of local space environments, potentially destabilizing existing orbits. # Theoretical Applications: - **Astrobiological / Astrochemical Laboratory:** A theoretical object like this could offer unique environments for studying decomposition, biogeochemical cycles, and even extremophile life in space, contributing valuable data for astrobiology. - **Waste Management:** On a more practical level, considering fantastical ideas like this can inspire innovative approaches to waste management and recycling on Earth, highlighting the urgent need for sustainable practices. In summary, while building a sphere of this magnitude out of trash and waste poses insurmountable environmental, ethical, and engineering challenges with our current technology and understanding, it invokes intriguing questions about waste reuse, planetary-scale engineering, and the human impact on Earth and beyond. It's essential to focus on sustainable practices and innovation within realistic boundaries to address waste management and environmental protection."},{"prompt":"I heated it into 40000 Kelvin","completion":"Heating a hypothetical sphere with a radius of 50,000 km made of trash and poop to a temperature of 40,000 Kelvin (K) introduces a whole new set of extreme conditions and implications, especially when considering the physics of such an event. At this temperature, the sphere becomes an astrophysical object, invoking principles seen in stellar physics rather than conventional environmental or engineering contexts. # Physical State at 40,000 K At 40,000 K, matter as we commonly experience it on Earth could not exist in a solid, liquid, or even traditional gaseous state. Instead, the materials making up the sphere would be in a plasma state, where electrons are stripped from atoms, and nuclei move about independently within an electrically charged sea of particles. # Pressure and Fusion The core temperature of the sun is about 15 million Kelvin, and its surface temperature is approximately 5,800 K. At 40,000 K, the sphere's surface would be much hotter than the sun's surface. Given the immense gravity that a sphere of this size would exert on its own matter (due to its mass), the conditions might facilitate nuclear fusion reactions if the pressure is also sufficiently high and the right elements are present, notably hydrogen. However, since the sphere is initially composed of trash and poop, the primary elements would likely be carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and traces of metals and other elements found in waste materials. In the intense heat and under the extreme pressure from the sphere's own gravity, some fusion processes could occur, particularly involving lighter elements like hydrogen, if present in sufficient quantity. # Energy and Stability Heating something to 40,000 K, especially an object of this magnitude, would require an astronomical amount of energy. This level of energy input and the resultant plasma state would have significant ramifications: 1. **Stability:** Maintaining structural integrity would be impossible in the conventional sense, as the matter would not hold a fixed shape but rather behave as a star or an artificial sun, potentially expanding due to thermal pressure. 2. **Radiation:** At these temperatures, the sphere would emit immense amounts of radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays, making it a potent source of energy and potentially hazardous object both close-up and from afar. 3. **Gravitational Interactions:** The mass of the sphere, combined with its energy output, would have significant effects on nearby celestial bodies, potentially disrupting orbits or triggering other energetic processes in its vicinity. # Astrophysical Object In essence, by heating the sphere to 40,000 K, it transcends being a mere assembly of waste and becomes an astrophysical object with characteristics akin to a small star. Its study would fall under the domain of astrophysics and stellar dynamics, offering hypothetical insights into plasma physics, high-energy astrophysics, and potentially contributing to our understanding of star formation and evolution. # Reality Check It's important to underline that this scenario is purely theoretical and highly unrealistic with our current technological capabilities and understanding of physics. The energy requirements, environmental impact, and technological challenges make it far beyond our reach. Instead, tackling waste management and energy use on Earth through sustainable practices remains the pressing and realistic challenge for humanity."},{"prompt":"It has cooled down into temperate, describe its appearance","completion":"Cooling down a hypothetical sphere with a radius of 50,000 km made of trash and poop from an extremely high temperature (like 40,000 Kelvin) back to a temperate condition introduces a thought experiment about transformation, energy, and astrophysical principles. Once the sphere cools to a \\"temperate\\" condition, which for the sake of this thought experiment we'll consider to be similar to Earth-like temperatures (ranging on average from about -20°C to 40°C or 253K to 313K), several speculative and fundamental changes in its appearance and composition would have occurred: # Possible Appearance and Composition 1. **Surface**: After undergoing intense heat and potentially nuclear fusion, the original materials would no longer exist in their initial forms. The extreme conditions would break down complex molecules into simpler elements, potentially facilitating fusion reactions among lighter elements. Upon cooling, the surface might consist of newly formed crystalline structures, metals, or even glassy substrates, depending on the remaining elemental composition. The appearance could vary from rocky and metallic landscapes to smooth, vitrified planes, resembling some meteorite surfaces or planetary crusts observed in our solar system. 2. **Craters and Irregularities**: Given the sphere's exposure to extreme conditions, including potential impacts from space debris attracted by its gravity during its hot phase, the surface could feature craters, similar to those seen on moons and planets. These features would tell a story of its thermal history and interactions with surrounding space. 3. **Atmosphere**: Depending on the volatile compounds present and their reactions during the heating and cooling phases, the sphere could develop a thin atmosphere. This atmosphere's composition would vastly differ from Earth's, potentially containing gases released during the decomposition and fusion processes, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor (if hydrogen and oxygen were present and recombined upon cooling), nitrogen, and trace gases. This atmosphere might appear as a faint haze from a distance, enveloping the sphere. 4. **Coloration**: The colors observed on the sphere's surface would depend on the elements and compounds that dominate its composition after cooling. Iron-rich compounds might lend it a reddish or rusty hue, while sulfur might contribute yellows and greens. If certain metals like copper were present in significant quantities, blue-green patinas could form. 5. **Luminescence and Temperature Variability**: Although \\"temperate\\" on a macro scale, localized temperature variations could exist, especially if residual heat pockets remain. Additionally, if radioactive elements are present, luminescence might occur in some regions due to radioluminescence, providing eerie glows or specks of light across its darkened landscape. # Reflections on Reality It’s crucial to frame this thought experiment within the bounds of speculative science fiction and theoretical physics. The described transformations, from waste to a plasma state and back to a temperate solid state, involve physics, chemistry, and thermodynamics principles far beyond current technological capabilities. Furthermore, the initial premise of creating and manipulating such a sphere made of trash and organic waste on this scale delves into the realm of pure imagination. Engaging in such speculative thinking, however, does invite reflection on real-world issues, such as the importance of responsible waste management, recycling, and the environmental impacts of human activity on Earth and potentially beyond. It also underscores the beauty and complexity of planetary formation and evolution, reminding us of the intricate processes that shape the worlds within our universe."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Richard Curtis: Actually in terms of getting into the industry at all my dad who was quite a serious man said that I had one year of fooling around and then I had to enter the marketing department at Unilever and in my first year I and I think 546 pounds or something like that but I then luckily got my first TV commission and that got me through the door as far as he was concerned and I got an agent actually by someone seeing me performing up in Edinburgh I got very lucky just that some lovely keen American woman who was living in London liked my jokes I got started in television by hanging onto the coattails of Rowan Atkinson who when he was 20 was a genius and it was obvious that he was going to be a TV star and I was his closest friend and wrote things for him and so we drifted in as comedians tend to by doing stage stuff of our own up in Edinburgh and then did a radio show which the traditional radio for which was pretty poor and then started writing sketches for a sketch show which became not the local news and then I wrote for that for for series so it was a very traditional route and then from a sketch show I went into a sitcom and then from a sitcom I went into films. INFLUENCES Question: What film or programme has influenced you the most? Richard Curtis: John Cleese in many ways weirdly is the most influential person in my career because when I was young Monty Python was all there was 50% of your conversation with friends was just quoting Monty Python sketches so as it were like a generation before would have had the goons and the generation after might have had you know the young months as it were for me it was Monty Python and that's what made me interested in humor and started me writing sketches and then strangely the reason we wrote Blackadder was because Fawlty Towers have been so extraordinary that when I tried to write a modern sitcom it just looked so pathetic in comparison to 40 does that we only wrote historical one to avoid Fawlty Towers but the big influence on my films would probably have to be Woody Allen just because I so loved his films when I was young and he made films changed style and developed so quickly so you were always interested by what he was going to do next and he gave me the confidence to try different things and it was particularly for me had written silly sketches and a silly sitcom so Woody Allen did silly films when he started out at Scotland from sketches and ended up writing Annie Hall which was much closer to what I loved and the first film of his that I really loved so me then having the confidence to arrive for weddings may have been based on my passion for our confidence gained from Woody Allen. ADVICE Question: What advice would you give to someone starting out? Richard Curtis: My obvious piece of advice is to make sure you write or do what you really like there was a bit of a pressure on me when I started they would say you know British rails funny or you know dreadful sandwiches that you buy and M&S a funny write joke about that and I think it's really important to do what you think is interesting not what other people tell you might be interesting for me writing to sort of get work because you know that sort of work is popular as a disaster so I would say right from the heart and hope that somebody likes it as a sort of person in films I suppose my obvious thing would be to take every stage of the process incredibly seriously and I would say to get very involved so I had a script editor who's also my girlfriend who made me rewrite “Four Weddings” 19 times so I didn't just handed something that I thought might be okay it would be ruthlessly dealt with I then worked with a director who was obsessed by casting and the casting process took forever so actually once the movie had been cast it was almost made and then I think the final thing is that when you're editing you can fix most films I mean at least three of my films have been when finished the first really careful cut of being spectacular disasters really really bad failed movies and we managed just by determination and thinking you know things through in a different way to make them eventually work by hook or by crook so those are some of my pieces of advice.” Video: Script to Screen Red Carpet: LOVE ACTUALLY with Richard Curtis | Matt Ryan – YouTube https://youtu.be/NbYecUZHgy4 Transcript: “Interviewer: I have question for you when you when you take something like “Love Actually” which i love dearly uh when you have like a multiple protagonist how do you balance like you know the screen time could you you have to cut some things you probably really cared about you know because you have multiple characters to explore. Richard Curtis: Well “Love Actually” of all the films i've written is the one that turned out most wrong after we'd shot it so in fact i think it's very hard to judge what you've got to try and do is write good stuff for all of them and then actually remake the order and remake the dynamic of it once it's shot that's what we did on “Love Actually” the the script i wrote had all the same contents but in a completely different order to the finished film. Interviewer: So something like “Notting Hill” was a little easier for you basically two characters Richard Curtis: She walks into the room she kisses him she goes away but in this one it was like playing three-dimensional chess because after every scene you could put any scene from any of the other 10 stories. Interviewer: So and maybe on uh when you do an ensemble piece and it's more the director on set which we directed of course has a lot more to do trying to rework the script at the same time Richard Curtis: no no i think they've got a lot to do in the edit that would be what i have to say i think they've got a lot to do in the edit in some ways they're great fun to do because you only have to work for a week or two with each actor so they never see through you and realize what a bad director you are.” Video: Richard Curtis On Creating A Classic Rom-Com | Fast Company - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FENpwVe14MA Transcript: “INTRO: (00:00) - Seeing as how love is quite a big subject. And I often think about serial killers. There've only been about eight of them. And yet, there are about 100 movies about them. And yet, every day a million people are in love, so I can't believe that romantic films won't, sort of, stay at the core of cinema, in one way or another. (00:17) (cheerful music) NOTTING HILL - I do solemnly declare. - I do solemnly declare. - [Priest] That I know not of any lawful impediment. - That I know not of any lawful impediment. - Why I, Lydia. - [Groom] Why I, Bernard. - \\"Four Weddings,\\" which is thought of as a romantic comedy, I didn't see as that. I thought of it as a semi-autobiographical film about love and friendship. (00:51) I wasn't really aware that there was genre or a rule book. Then I became more aware, with \\"Notting Hill,\\" that that was what I was up to. Every Thursday, I used to go and have dinner with my friends, Piers and Paula. And I just thought, if I turned up at Piers and Paula's, if Madonna was my date, how would they react? Helen Fielding, who then wrote Bridget Jones, obsessive Madonna fan. (01:16) She would scream a lot and lose her cool. And neither Piers, nor Paula, would have any idea who she was. And that exact scene actually happens in \\"Notting Hill\\". - Last film you did, what'd you get paid? - 15 million dollars. - Right. - The curious thing about \\"Notting Hll\\" is that, even though Hugh had been the star, Hugh Grant had been the star of \\"Four Weddings,\\" I didn't want Hugh Grant. (01:40) I very specifically didn't want him. Because I thought it would so fantastic to have a complete unknown, which would really have made the movie be like a perfect mirror to the story itself. But we auditioned about 10 people, and I thought, oh god, I'll never find anyone who's any good. We might as well cast Hugh. (01:59) I'm quite embarrassed by \\"I'm just a girl, \\"standing in front of a boy,\\" because I clearly thought it was a good line. Because in the next scene, one of the characters says to Hugh Grant, \\"what did she say?\\" And he says, \\"oh, she's just--\\" - A girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. (02:17) - So I obviously thought, I better repeat it, like it was going back to the chorus, or the hook, in a song. BRIDGET JONES (upbeat music) Well, the terrifying thing about being involved in \\"Bridget Jones\\" was actually Helen Fielding, because she was my best friend; it was her book. And I'd actually read \\"Bridget\\" seven times before it came out because she gave it to me with every extra 50 pages. (02:40) We cast Renee, and we made the film. And then we had trouble editing the film. And Helen was full of, \\"that's not quite like Bridget. \\"This isn't quite right.\\" And then you realize the big revelation to making movies, that there comes a point where you've gotta stop thinking about your source, as it were, stop thinking about the script you've written, or the book that the script you've written is based on, and say our Bridget is Renee. (03:04) And the moment that we accepted that, and all the wonderful qualities that she brought to the film, some of which might not be the exact representation of the book, but was a fully-fledged, fabulous human. You then edit the movie towards what you've got, and that means that, in some ways, it's better for that, because you've got an embodiment of a special, cinematic Bridget, rather than an attempt to just reproduce what was in the book. LOVE ACTUALLY (03:33) ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ Where no one's ever gone ♪ - Yeah. - I mean, \\"Love Actually\\" was partly inspired by the fact that I had done these three romantic comedies before, and I, in fact, didn't want to write another one. The plot in that movie, of Hugh and Martine, was a whole film I thought of doing. (03:54) And the plot of Colin Firth's story was a whole film that I had intended to write. So, what I was trying to do was, it was push the romantic comedy genre as far as it could possibly go. And just take the three best scenes of 10 different films and shove them all together. The big inspiration was \\"Nashville,\\" a Robert Altman movie, and \\"Short Cuts,\\" a Robert Altman Movie. (04:17) Which are very standards to be aiming for, because these are two of my favorite movies of all time. These movies with a lot of plots are tough to do. \\"Love Actually,\\" in its first edit, was the third worst film of all time. I mean it was really the worst example I can remember of something which had worked brilliantly in a read-though, not working well. (04:39) So it was like playing three-dimensional chess, because any scene could go after any other scene, from any other point, in any of the other stories. So, that was very, very hard work. I was a new director. And if it had been a movie in which there was a cast who would've had 10 weeks to get used to me, maybe they would've got used to me. (04:58) But we only had one week per plot. So I felt I was auditioning for the actors every single week. What I realized was quite how unfair I'd been on the directors that I'd worked with beforehand. Because there's this terrible contradiction in movies, that a writer's got two years to fix absolutely everything, and then the director's got one day in which to shoot it. (05:21) And suddenly I understood why sometimes the directors had rushed through things I thought was important or been happy when they got it. Because I was always saying, oh, let's have another go, let's try it another way. - I'd only give one piece of advice to anyone marrying: try and marry someone kind. (05:39) - The original inspiration for \\"About Time\\" is the scene that most people talk to me about, which is the scene on a beach, when the leading character travels back to just spend an afternoon with his dad who's just died. And, almost for the first time in the movies, the idea I had was based on a visual thing. (05:58) And I remember starting now, at last, as a writer, to start to sort of think, well, what really matters about that scene isn't so much all the words that they're saying, but where they're standing, that it's a lonely street. So I think, at last, by \\"About Time\\" I was gaining a bit of visual confidence. (06:17) And I hired the cameraman from my favorite visual movie, called \\"Like Crazy,\\" that Drake Doremus made. And I started to think, if you want to fall in love with a character, then the words can do two-thirds of it, but if you can shoot it well, then maybe that's gonna be the thing which, as it were, goes into your heart without knowing how it got there. (06:42) ♪ Oh, I believe in yesterday ♪ - Oh my, when did you write that? - I didn't write it; Paul McCartney wrote it, the Beatles. - Who? - I mean I've been obsessed by the Beatles for the whole of my life. That's the real inspiration. But then, of course, the inspiration that the Beatles gave me was that a lot of their stuff was about love. (07:08) We got permission, fabulously, to use, I think, 18 Beatles' songs, and they didn't say which. It was a wonderful thing to write, because I'd be typing along and think, okay, he's having a crisis. And then I'd go through the Beatles catalog and think, well, \\"Help\\" is clearly, if he's gonna sing any song now, it should be \\"Help. (07:26) \\" It was a wonderful thing 'cause they've got such a range that, as I told this tale, there was always a perfect Beatles' song to go in. I think that the curve of my career is to realize that love doesn't end at the first kiss or as you walk down the aisle in wedding. That's where some of my movies did end. (07:46) When I went to \\"Love Actually,\\" which had brothers and sisters, and fathers and sons, and married couples. And then, \\"About Time\\" was a romantic comedy for half of it and then a film about death and family and marriage. And that \\"Yesterday\\" is a movie about love of music and love. (08:03) I think I've learned that love's a big subject that the traditional shape of a rom-com doesn't quite cover.” Video: \\"Richard Curtis And His Very Limited Experience Of Life\\" - Notting Hill Screenwriter Criticised - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQnQC8vGdo Transcript: (00:00) well comedian Ria Lena joins us in the studio now Ria what do you reckon um do you reckon that that the Richard Curtis should be regretting these jokes that he's made in the past or do do you think he's learned his lesson do you know I think it is about whether he should or he shouldn't I think it's the fact that he is he is looking back and he is seeing in his old work through current eyes and I think there's a lot of people that agree with him are they looking at their work through current eyes um and (00:27) regretting what they did is there not just an acknowledgement that really the world's changed I mean this is a really inter my gosh that is the most leftwing question you've ever asked I've been watch for a while I'm being serious I know the world's changed but you can't apologize for everything listen to this this is interesting Tina we've got loads of respon to this section there was no one more loved or more relevant than Robin Williams nothing was off limits he was comedic genius that's why we loved (00:51) him he must be turning in his grave to see what's happening to Comedy now because they look back the whole time I think it's a very relevant point I and I'm trying to think of of something that Robin Williams said that that in any way was was offensive he did Cover a wide range of topics he wore a fat suit for Mrs dfire was that disrespectful no that was Mrs Doubtfire he was pretending to be a Scottish nanny I don't are we implying that all Scottish nannies are we didn't have enough time in this (01:17) segment to discuss Mrs delire what a film in itself uh but well the thing is is that if you want to be successful you're going to want to make most of the people laugh most of the time all right nobody's really said that anything's per se of limits but it might limit who's going to enjoy your artwork so Ava Santina and I were talking about this earlier in our pay-per review uh the fat jokes that he would make about Bridget Jones uh and about Marty McCutchen's character in Love Actually where car (01:46) another character called her the chubby one which she wasn't at all we were led to believe at me as a young girl that Bridget Jones was overweight or even fat and I look at her now with Modern Eyes and go she hardly had on it no but I think a film but part of that part of that was the fact that the actress are suffer El wagger it was a whole publicity compan how much weight she had to put on for it because they didn't even cast somebody you know that that would fit that would fit that role I think the Bridget Jones thing is (02:19) interesting I don't think that I mean yes there were a lot of fat jokes but what I think that was if you look at the original Helen Fielding books you know he didn't completely rewrite the books this was a character that was sad to be single she was obsessed about her weight uh I think the issue was is that it was it was screen written by a straight white male instead of perhaps a woman that could understand exactly what Helen Fielding was getting at with that character and then just portray that the (02:43) way that we women would understand give you Steven both of you understood this it's ridiculous apologizing for a joke written 30 years ago if it was funny then in my mind it's funny now I'm sick of being expected to accept that everything I've ever learned loved and laughed at is wrong it is not wrong simply a reflection of my life and time no I'm sorry about the reflection of your life and time Stephen but but he has a right to that opinion and I have a right to have an opinion on his opinion (03:07) um so when we move to the the the topic of minorities in Richard Curtis films there's no doubt you watch Notting Hill there's not a single black character in it you watch Love Actually there are very few black characters in it and that's you know London in the naughties OR Notting Hill in the '90s OR that's Richard Curtis and his very limited experience of life he said himself he went to her and then he went to Oxford and he never looked outside of that and that really is a question about who are (03:35) we allowing to write art and who are we turning to and that is you know brings us on to the diversity question I know a lot of people going why do we have so much diversity so that we can have a wider range of authentic artwork put in front of us comedy or otherwise in terms of what's on or off limits I mean we we cover all things in drama all things are covered what what why you're you're she got a lovely Tour on rear Awakening I get that to 2023 where are see well that we're getting free tickets putting you on is that (04:03) right where

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4XaYbQlKxI Transcript: Richard Curtis: (00:04) hello my name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and this is apparently my career in four minutes [extract from a movie] my dear son this is going to sound strange but there's this secret but the men in this family can travel in time Richard Curtis: Wow I mean I think of anything the secret of my films has been alive still tried to keep writing sketches and many of them if you look at “Four Weddings” it's it's in a funny way sketch movie really this these two jokes of this wedding these two jokes of the next wedding and if you look at “Notting Hill” (00:36) those seen when in the junket where is being interviewed that's like a sketch about somebody misunderstanding a film or not have you seen a film so I think they're sketch writing definitely informed and was crucial to the movie career I think the magic of sitcom is probably still writing sketches in sitcom but the plot structure of sitcom which is so crucial I don't think resembles the structure of movies very much so I think this it's harder to see the line between the sitcoms and the films. “The Tall Guy” was a very happy (01:07) film Jeff gobble a very funny man and I particularly remember just roaring with laughter in a scene where Rowan was having a party when he'd sacked Jeff go from and he for the party just bought a mini bottle of champagne because at the end of my tour with Roman we did 72 dates and Roland had a party and he bought one bottle of champagne and one pizza not one pizza for all of us one pizza so I remember having a very good time on that the successful forwards and femur was a complete surprise to everybody I got a piece of paper from (01:43) MGM or whoever owned the movie and Paula Graham who at the movie and next to America of the expected earnings that said naught so it was a great shock to everybody the strange thing was I remember thinking of the plot of Notting Hill on a very wet afternoon sitting in a waiting room with corin redgrave who played and in the dalles husband and James fleet on for wedding so I actually thought of knotting here while we were making for wedding so it was lucky for me that that coming out of the success of for weddings I already knew what I (02:19) was going to do rather than thinking oh god what's next the thing about Love Actually is it was a curious film because everybody was only on it for a week or for two weeks so that nobody could see quite how bad I was about it because just when they were thinking of my god really doesn't know what he's doing they were off so it was it was it was it was nerve-racking but it was like I could start 12 times you know every time we've got a new bunch I would be a little bit better one of the reasons I (02:46) wrote that film was because there's a whole chunk of it was particularly the Robert Altman ones but I love Nashville as a movie called smooth and I love they loved pulp fiction so there were a lot of a multi-storey for shortcuts it was a genre i love the strange thing about the cast of the boat rocked as they were almost all in every single scene so that was when i started directing just with the camera on people's shoulders so that instead of saying a single of him a secured him a single of helena chemicals (03:16) go like that and find whoever was talking I think what I learned was the sort of negative lesson which is that I didn't like the formal structures moving making I did not like doing the wide shot followed by a two-shot follow back because he just get locked in at the beginning of the day into one performance and one geography so I think that I in this in the boat the rod and now in about time the cameras very fluid and flexible and just waiting to catch good things rather you know being part of a verse of a (03:43) formal shooting straight working with earl morris with students berber was absolute joy because steven is a sultan it really is storytelling genius so you would come up with a scene and he would say what that sounds great how about this and suddenly he would imagine 10 minutes of cinema that you can completely see if you said well I'm not sure that's right because this character wouldn't do that he'd imagined another whole 10 minutes of cinema I mean he was fantastic like someone who could go on (04:09) writing brilliant Tunes one after anot her well it's funny I have already written to time travel thing said there was time traveling in a black and a special that we do and I did a doctor who which was fun time traveling back to him Vincent van Gogh so I obviously am interested in it I didn't research time travel movies before I made my wanted to go back and watch I mean at the moment I'm not intending to direct something again the moment the message of about time is just do stress do less stressful (04:40) things and enjoy yourself and so the next time i work with bill will be working on a walking holiday rather than a movie.” Video: Richard Curtis and His Start with Four Weddings and a Funeral - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YutcjLfHVRI Transcript: (00:04) Interviewer: the film that we first got to know you with As Americans uh was “Four Weddings and a funeral” was it the first film you wrote Richard Curtis: second I wrote a film called “The Tall Guy” which was Emma Thompson's Emma Thompson and Jeff Goldblum MH that that smatter is an exact proportional representation um of how much money that movie made in comparison to Four Weddings Interviewer: okay so “four weddings and a funeral” um introdu gave us Hugh Grant in America that's sort of what all sold us on Hugh Grant um would you like to apologize to anyone right now Richard Curtis: (00:39) the answer the official answer is only to Divine Brown isn't it that's the that's the official answer to the question but no no I mean I didn't I tried not to allow Hugh to audition because I thought he was too handsome and I thought it would… Interviewer: he wasn't he wasn't you didn't think he was right for that part Richard Curtis: no no and in fact in the end were me the director and the producer and it came down to choosing between Hugh and Alan Rickman and I voted for Alan wow so I I I was so wrong um but would have been a very (01:14) different part yeah and the thing is I'd imagined it like breaking away in a film called Gregory's girl a very great English movie where uh I thought that that the the guy had to be not attractive particularly that had to be the explanation and then he found true love I didn't realize that by making him attractive it would make the film sort of three times as successful but Hugh was uh Hugh was the only but Hugh was the only person who could do the lines of all the 70 people we auditioned and he was extraordinarily on point he was (01:47) completely accurate he he did everything as exactly as I'd dreamt it I was I was very lucky.” Video: ‘Love Actually’ writer Richard Curtis

probably was when I wrote it Interviewer: he says he still wants to write about our Humanity the surprising ways we are good to each other in a world that has so many movies filled with trauma and violence Richard Curtis: we get thousands of films about serial killers and there's only ever been about nine of them and yeah there'll be a million people falling in love feeling it's the most interesting moment of their lives Good Deeds inside families and Good Deeds inside (00:38) communities if you look at what happened during covid and the extraordinary sort of bravery and heroism I do think the way to think about life is that every day has the potential in all its Simplicity just to be just to be gorgeous.” Video: (1) Richard Curtis explains why he likes to set his films in Britain - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvBZnc_Wbg Transcript: (00:03) and I wrote the script and it was set in Boston and I went to see the people at MGM and they said this is amazing this is a fantastic script I said oh I'm so thrilled and they said except the two leading characters we don't like I said why and they said well it's sort of weak no one's gonna admire them we'll want to spend time with them I said no and they said the dialogues very English it doesn't really read American so you'll have to work on that and I said oh right and then they said which means that most (00:38) of the jokes don't work because people won't get their humor so I said that only needs the title that's the only thing we've got and they said we hate the time and I I flew home two weeks later and I swore I'll never do a film that's not set actually where I live.\\" Be as much detailed as possible. PLEASE","completion":"Analyzing Richard Curtis's approach to screenwriting offers a fascinating insight into the mind of one of Britain's most beloved storytellers. Known for iconic films such as \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" \\"Notting Hill,\\" and \\"Love Actually,\\" Curtis has carved a unique niche in the realm of romantic comedies, blending humor with deep emotional resonance. Through the various transcripts provided, key aspects of his narrative style, themes, and writing process emerge, showcasing a writer deeply committed to exploring love, friendship, and the human condition, all while maintaining a distinctly British flair. # Narrative Structures and Techniques Curtis's films often utilize innovative narrative structures to engage the audience. For example, \\"Love Actually\\" employs a multi-narrative format, interweaving various love stories into a single cohesive narrative. This approach, inspired by Robert Altman's \\"Nashville\\" and \\"Short Cuts,\\" as Curtis mentions, allows for a rich exploration of love's various facets. It's not merely about romantic love but encompasses familial, platonic, and unrequited love. Curtis's adeptness at this complex structure speaks to his assertion that writing \\"Love Actually\\" was like \\"playing three-dimensional chess,\\" highlighting his skill in balancing multiple storylines without losing coherence or emotional impact. # Themes Curtis's work is permeated with recurring themes, most notably love, friendship, and the intrinsic beauty of everyday life. In discussing \\"About Time,\\" Curtis reflects on moving beyond traditional romantic comedy endings, exploring love's broader scope, including family and personal growth. This theme is a testament to his belief in love's omnipresence and significance in diverse forms, a sentiment echoed in his musings on the universality of love and its rightful place at the core of cinema. Another recurring theme is the ordinary juxtaposed with the extraordinary. In \\"Notting Hill,\\" the mundane life of a bookstore owner is upended by his love affair with a famous actress, a premise born from Curtis's simple yet ingenious thought experiment about bringing Madonna home to dinner. This interplay between the everyday and the extraordinary allows Curtis to delve into themes of identity, fame, and the transformative power of love. # Writing Process Curtis's writing process reveals a blend of meticulous planning and adaptive creativity. His admission of rewriting \\"Four Weddings\\" 19 times underscores a dedication to refinement and perfection. Meanwhile, the genesis of \\"Notting Hill\\" during the filming of \\"Four Weddings\\" shows how ideas can simmer and evolve over time. This mix of perseverance and spontaneity, coupled with a deep involvement in all stages of film production—writing, casting, directing, and editing—showcases Curtis's holistic view of storytelling. Curtis also emphasizes the importance of writing from the heart, a sentiment that reflects in his advice to aspiring writers. He champions authenticity and personal connection to one's work, suggesting that the most compelling stories come from a place of genuine interest and affection. This ethos is evident in his heartfelt exploration of themes close to his experience and worldview, making his films resonate on a profoundly personal level with audiences. # Social Commentary and Evolving Perspectives Curtis's films are not without their critics, as highlighted in discussions about the lack of diversity in his earlier work and the portrayal of certain characters. His reflective stance on these critiques, considering his \\"limited experience of life\\" outside certain socio-economic bubbles, indicates an awareness and willingness to engage with critical feedback. This openness to reassessment underscores the evolving nature of storytelling and the importance of diverse perspectives in enriching narrative cinema. # Conclusion Richard Curtis's contribution to screenwriting is marked by his unique blend of humor, emotional depth, and innovative storytelling. His narrative techniques, thematic explorations, and iterative writing process illustrate a creator deeply in tune with the human experience. Curtis's films remind us of love's myriad forms and the beauty inherent in the everyday, making his work a significant touchstone in the landscape of British cinema."},{"prompt":"Regenerate the response.

Richard Curtis: nobody knows I don't even I don't know I can't remember I can't remember how it's done that's the strange thing is it is a sort of organic organic process so one of the things is to make sure that you really do believe in the story that it keeps coming back to you so that as it (00:35) were there's a purpose to it I then I mean I used to be the most ill-disciplined writer I would get up at one watch some television have some tea make some phone calls have some dinner big oh I should probably start now but since I've had kids and a family I actually do try and go to a quiet place and write a lot Interviewer: have you had a favorite character? Richard Curtis: I'd I liked the stupid ones I like the stupid characters so there was baldrick and Blackadder and Emma chambers in The Vicar of Dibley and Rhys Ifans and Notting Hill it's just so nice (01:14) to have someone who gets a laugh Interviewer: and any advice for young screenwriters of today Richard? Richard Curtis: my advice is to work with people you genuinely admire I think that it can be a real mistake and this goes back to what you know we're doing here which is you find the people who are passionate and you work with them and you find the companies who are passionate the politicians who are passionate and I think sometimes young writers will make a mistake of saying well this is a famous name if that person wants to make my film that would be fantastic and (01:53) that's a famous actor and if they want to be in my film that's fantastic but if you don't like that directors work and if that actor is not the right actor for the part it will the whole thing won’t you know won't work so I think trying to keep your sense of integrity even in the face of more shiny objects Video: Exclusive Insight from Rowan Atkinson & Co-Creator & Writer, Richard Curtis | Happy Birthday Mr Bean - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt8agz7jipY Transcript: Person 1: (00:06) what was usually funny was just the process of of how he gets out of a difficult situation or how he gets into a difficult situation [Extract from Mr Bean] Charcter 1: done your revision? Bean: oh yes i've concentrated on trigonometry Character 1: i've done calculus mainly Bean: i believe they concentrated on calculus last year Character 1: oh dear Character 2: quiet ladies and gentlemen please the exam starts now [end of extraction] Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson): bodily expression particularly with mr bean is so very very important it's sort of screaming at you you know there may be no words but you're being shouted at i think very loudly by the (00:59) bodily expression the word compelling is quite good because i think that's what draws you into a lot of mr bean sketches Richard Curtis: you only have to have the starting point of the idea he gets locked out of his room or he's going to a swimming pool or something like that and then you could be pretty confident that we would be able to to make it work [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: with those who answer the green calculus papers please put them in the green box and those who answer the white trigonometry papers please put them in the white box [End of extract] Richard Curtis: what i've always done on the mr beans is (02:09) it where i've done the charcoal outline and then rowan adds all the color and the texture and i laughed at him while he's doing it [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: i said stop writing will you stop writing Narrator: it is 30 years since the first mr bean was shown on british television and it became an instant hit between 1990 and 1995 the team went on to produce 14 episodes in total Person 3 (Sir Tony Robinson): i didn't know until this moment there were only 14. (02:49) i thought there were probably 114 and that roman had been coining in for years and years making this never-ending flow of mr beans Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson) : we did the other 14 episodes in drips and drabs we didn't make 14 at once we made two and then we made three more and then we made one one and we made four more and eventually we got to this rather poultry sum of 14. (03:16) they were always given a sort of prime spot and and they keep that and suddenly you know people realize that visual comedy could actually hold a large audience Narator: after the overnight success of episode 1 the team was in need of new material and comedy writer robin driscoll was hired he would also feature in various sketches as a straight man to rowan Richard Curtis: i would say in the story of mr bean it's rowan, robin, and then possibly me i was thinking away rowan and i did the obvious ones we got the low hanging fruit and what was brilliant about robin (04:08) is that he's just kept as it were squeezing the lemon finding new things finding different ways taking a little thread be it to do with the car or with the teddy or anything like that.

My question is, when can I see it? You can never see it. No one will ever see it. But it's a funny thing with Pirate Radio. Now I think about it, I think if I'd written it now, I would have done it as a TV series. Actually, it was very kind of episodic, and we should have done one where they raid another boat, one where they start to drown, one where the electricity goes down. But it was fun at five hours, but I don't think for human consumption. Well, you never know. I mean, Baz just released his Australia cut on Hulu as a miniseries. So maybe you want to revisit that as a... Anyway, that's just a hypothetical. So I read a few years ago that Hugh Grant revealed Notting Hill was maybe based on a friend of yours. And I wanted to know if it's possibly time for the truth to come out. No. I wouldn't go to Hugh Grant for the truth, if you're searching for it. It was really based on a kind of fantasy I used to have. I used to go for dinner every week with the same people and have the same conversation. And I remember when I was an obsessive Madonna fan, I thought... what would it be like if at last I managed to walk in with with a woman instead of just on my own with a warm bottle of white wine and kind of so the movie started with that kind of dream scenario of what would it be like if you could and you know I was thinking about Madonna and one of my friends at that dinner was an obsessive Madonna fan and the other one would definitely never have heard of her so it was based on a on a dream rather than on a on a fact. So it's the 20th anniversary of Love Actually and it's now become a Christmas classic you know people love the movie I love the movie and if it comes on it means I have to keep watching. When did you realize wait a minute this film has become something special to a lot of people? It was it was when I started getting texts from people I didn't know very well saying we're watching it again you know it was it did take a while and it's still a bit of a mystery to me I mean I've got a theory I think the reason people watch it again is they can never remember what's going to happen next you know normally when you watch a movie you know they've robbed the bank they're going to get in the car drive away and then they're going to get shot by the police whereas even I when I watch Love Actually don't have any idea what the next scene is so I think it kind of it's bearable to watch it again because it's always surprising you but you know it's a once in a lifetime bit of luck when you make something particularly Christmas. I used to so love watching Charlie Brown's Christmas every Christmas and White Christmas every Christmas. So I'm, it's a real little, it's a real little boost for me. Did you ever think the Andrew Lincoln storyline might be a little too weird? I am very often told it's a little too weird. It didn't occur to me at the time, but you know times change. And I remember someone once saying they would like to interview me about it and they would be focusing on the stalking scene. And I said, \\"Oh, I didn't know there was a stalking scene.\\" And they said, \\"Yeah, yeah, no, you know, the Andrew Lincoln, that's like top notch stalking.\\" So, you know, slowly but surely I've realized what a dreadful mistake I made. I don't think it's a mistake as much as, you know, it's a little different than the rest. But anyway, there's a new 4K release that's about to come out. What are you actually most excited for people to see on it? Well, it is very pretty now. I mean, it is interesting. You know, one of the things I do like about Love Actually is I love how kind of it looks. I think actually the kind of texture of it is very, has a sort of magic to it. And we've really added to that. The 4K, you know, where there were fuzzes in the background, you can see chandeliers and candles and everything like that. So I think it's just a sort of general feeling that the movie somehow got. a little bit better, that it's even more cheerful than it was before. That, so the grade is really lovely and then we've also remixed it and that's fun as well because, you know, technical things do improve as time goes by. If you can imagine watching a brighter version of White Christmas, what joy that would be. You've directed, you've written a lot, but you've only directed a few things. Do you have plans for directing something else or you, no? No, I found directing quite tricky. And I mean, this movie is a great example. I wrote a movie set in New York, which is such a pleasure for me, but I would have felt really insecure as a non-American directing it. And also, you know, I'm getting old and Sam Boyd who directed it is not only an American, but young. So I think I'll always find someone who's better than me now. I don't necessarily better than you, I'd just say different than you. Also, I'm trying to keep my weight down. And when you direct movies, you have to eat a certain number of donuts and bacon sandwiches. And I think that's, you know, that's a heavy price to pay. I don't think people realize, actually, the one thing is there's a lot of food on movie sets, not in the UK. The UK is a little stingy, but in America, forget it. Whatever they call it, that service table. It's the most dreadful temptation. Making a movie is like going to Willy Wonka. Yes. It's just sweets everywhere. Unless you're in the UK. I've done UK set visits and you're lucky to get a cup of tea. No, it's true. American movies are better. Just on craft service. On craft service. Right, exactly. So a lot of people with Genie will not realize this is a remake of something you made many years ago. And so I'm just curious, how did it come about to remake this? Well, it's funny. Not long after I made the original movie, which is only an hour long, I thought this would have been fun as a movie movie. But time goes by, you have children and all that kind of stuff. And then just a couple of years ago, I thought I will go back and look. And my circumstances, that's about kind of a sad singleton who's just lost his girlfriend. And I thought, well, I'd love to make a movie about families on Christmas. And I can actually write a really different movie. I can set it in America. We can have a female Genie. And then, you know, the dream came true and we got Melissa. So there was just enough, you know, a lot of extra things. And then I do love Christmas movies. And if I can, you know, do another one, that makes me happy. One of the things about a film where you have a Genie and they can wish for anything is it can get expensive very fast. So how much in the writing of this, of the remake, are you thinking we can't afford that? So let me not even write it. you know, what normally happens is you write a movie and then people tell you, you can't afford it. So I don't remember thinking, I've got to, I can't do this or that. And then I think there were moments of realism, you know, we couldn't get a real cap. But I think that on the whole, my imagination is pretty modest. So most of it happens, you know, in a pretty realistic environment. And then once in a while they say, you know, change a, you know, Christmas market to, you know, a coffee stall. Sure. You have a number of references to Tom Cruise in the film. And I'm curious, did you need permission when she's wearing that shirt? Like how did that all come about? We did need permission from Tom. It was so sweet that he gave it, you know, because there's an element of teasing. I once worked, tried to do a film with Tom and he was always so delightful and friendly to me. And I don't know whether the reason he said yes is because, you know, he was so chummy then. But I love the fact that I have eventually written a Tom Cruise movie. Just so happens Tom's not in it. Exactly. But he's on the t-shirt. He's on the t-shirt and we've got like a three second clip from Mission Impossible. Yeah. When I saw that, I was like, oh, wow. I mean, you need permission for this. This is a, you know what I mean? So one of the things about this is that it's more of a family film. And I'm curious, how did the balance of that come about in terms of how much, no, actually, let me skip that question altogether. I'm fascinated by the editing process 'cause it's where it all comes together. How did this possibly change in the editing room in ways you didn't expect? Or was this all Sam and you just saw the finished film? - No, no. I mean, editing is my favorite part of the process because it's just so interesting. You write a film, it reads really well. You shoot the film, you watch it, you think it's the worst film you've ever seen. And it's really interesting. And one of the thing, you know, how you have to take out bits, change bits, stress bits. You know, one of the great things about Melissa in this is she's both magical, but very normal. And the first time I thought it, about an hour in, I thought, \\"Oh, I've forgotten she's a genie.\\" You know, she's just a lovely woman. And then you have to build up, put scenes where she does magic closer together. And then the great thing about Christmas movies is just the wealth of wonderful Christmas songs. You know, you suddenly can, if it's getting a bit weak, you throw in the OJs or Otis Redding or a bit of Anvil and suddenly the movie perks up. So, no, just like all my movies, it was a bit of a struggle. But. Particularly because the two leads, well, I say the two leads and Mark Maron and Louise Guzman, because the cast was so strong, we had very firm foundations. But as always, it was a it was a journey. What do you think would surprise soon to be fans of Genie to learn about the making of Genie? Well, I think they shouldn't be surprised that some of the funniest lines were written by Melissa McCarthy and Mark Maron. You know, I'm quite a tyrant in terms of my own lines, but these were really clever, great American comedians. And they added, you know, they added stuff in. And I think that, you know, I think everyone will perhaps be surprised how convincingly American it is. And that's because, you know, Sam's an American director. And so I hope that it feels like a Richard Curtis movie, but in a whole new in a whole new world. I am a fan of your work, have been for a very long time. I'm obviously very curious what you are working on now. Well, I'm working on buying Christmas presents and decorating the tree. You know, that's that's the big stuff. Oh, I've got a few things. I've been working on an animation, which has been a gripping process. I mean, it's the longest filmmaking in the world. But it's really interesting because you write, direct, cast, shoot and edit all at the same time. So that's been very interesting to me. And now I think I might write a play. Really? Yeah, go on. Are you writing it now, or it's... I've had a go. I've started a couple of them, so I think that might be the next thing I do. The animated thing you're talking about is called \\"That Christmas.\\" Yes. Oh, I didn't... That's my final outing to Christmas, by the way. It is? It's all going to be Easter and Midsummer's Day from now on. Sir, you have an addiction to Christmas. I'm sure that the play takes place at Christmas. No. No. There's not going to be any Christmas. I'm going to do \\"Delete All\\" on my computer whenever Christmas is mentioned again, but I'm hoping... You know, with Jeannie, I'm trying to go out with a bang. No, I think you mean \\"That Christmas,\\" you're going to go out with a bang. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm going out with a pre-bang on Jeannie. Exactly. When actually is that coming out? Do you know? Next Christmas, because Christmas takes so long. So a year from now, we will be talking again? I hope so. And you will be talking about how the play all of a sudden went to taking place at Christmas. Yeah, the play will be \\"Christmas Carol\\" by then. Right. You have actually done a tremendous amount through your career, and I am curious, if someone has never seen anything you've done before, what do you want them watching first and why? Wow. What a... Do you know, the thing I really like... Sometimes I go online and I find that somebody who isn't me has edited... like my movies down to three minutes with a really pretty pop song. I think start with that. You know, lots of pretty people and no, you know, dodgy jokes. I'd go for Richard Curtis, the montage. Start there. I'm very... I think Four Weddings is lovely. And I wrote a TV show called Blackadder. And the final episode of the final series of that is, I think, an interesting piece of work. So there are some things I like. But start with Genie. Start with Genie. - Of course. Last question for you. Which of the films that you worked on or wrote do you think changed in the editing room? Which of the films changed the most in the editing room in ways you didn't expect going in? - Oh, that's definitely Love Actually, strangely. Because Love Actually was, you know, 10 stories and it seemed to work well. And it is in a completely different order to what we wrote it in. It's unrecognizable from the original order, even though the scenes are the same. It was like playing three-dimensional chess because you could put any scene after any scene at any point. That's definitely the one that changed most. - On that note, sir, I wish you nothing but the best. Thank you for giving me your time and good luck with the rest of your speed dating. - That's so sweet. Don't go changing and Merry Christmas. - Great. See you later from Horton Held.","completion":"Analyzing Richard Curtis's approach to screenwriting and directing provides a broad view of his impact on British cinema and international audiences. His work, characterized by a unique blend of wit, romance, and poignant moments, has made significant contributions to the romantic comedy genre. From iconic films like \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" to \\"Love Actually,\\" Curtis's distinctive narrative voice resonates through his exploration of love, the absurdity of life, and the beauty of everyday moments. # Approach to Screenwriting Curtis's screenwriting process, as he reveals, is organic and somewhat elusive, even to himself. He stresses the importance of belief in the story, highlighting that a narrative should continually draw back to its core purpose (CNBC International TV Interview). This approach ensures that his films carry a strong thematic spine, often centered around love in its myriad forms. Curtis's transition from being the \\"most ill-disciplined writer\\" to adopting a more structured routine due to family commitments speaks to his adaptability and the evolving nature of creative processes. # Character Development Curtis has a fondness for creating \\"stupid\\" characters that provide comedic relief while also endearing themselves to the audience. Characters like Baldrick in \\"Blackadder,\\" Emma Chambers in \\"The Vicar of Dibley,\\" and Rhys Ifans in \\"Notting Hill\\" showcase his ability to use humor to deepen the narrative and enhance the relatability of his stories (CNBC International TV Interview). These characters often find themselves in ludicrous situations, which not only serve as comic relief but also underscore Curtis's belief in the value of every narrative's levity. # Collaborative Efforts A significant aspect of Curtis's work ethic is his emphasis on collaboration with individuals he genuinely admires, highlighting the potential pitfalls of working with 'shiny objects' - i.e., famous names that may not necessarily align with the project’s vision (CNBC International TV Interview). This insight into his process not only acknowledges the importance of synergy in creative ventures but also serves as advice to emerging screenwriters, emphasizing integrity over fame. # Evolution of Ideas Curtis's narrative ideas evolve from simple concepts to complex, layered stories, often incorporating a blend of genres to convey the richness of human experiences. For instance, his simple wish to write about appreciating a normal day evolved into the time-travel movie \\"About Time,\\" blending science fiction with a profound exploration of happiness and the beauty of ordinary life (AMC Interview). This reflects Curtis's ability to infuse depth and meaning into seemingly straightforward narratives. # Editing and the Creative Process Editing emerges as Curtis's favorite part of the filmmaking process, underscoring its role in transforming the written script into the final cinematic experience. He describes how films can shift dramatically from the initial cut to the final product through editing, emphasizing the necessity of adaptation and the removal of segments that don't serve the overarching story effectively. Notably, \\"Love Actually\\" underwent significant changes during this process, with Curtis comparing the challenge to playing \\"three-dimensional chess\\" due to its multiple interlinking storylines (Collider Interviews). # Contributions to Cinema Richard Curtis's contributions to cinema extend beyond his narrative ingenuity to include insights into the collaborative nature of filmmaking, the evolutionary trajectory of stories from concept to screen, and the malleability required during the editing process. His enduring themes of love, human connection, and the idiosyncrasies of life remain central to his appeal, ensuring his films' place in both British and international cinematic landscapes. Through his work, Curtis invites audiences to find joy and resonance in the sprawling messiness of life, articulated through his unique lens of humor, empathy, and emotional depth."},{"prompt":"Regenerate the response, with longer, more details and in the format for video scriptwriting. Also keep synthesizing and arranging all the transcripts given above and also the transcripts as follows to update in the response: \\"Video: Richard Curtis | BAFTA Screenwriters' Lecture Series | BAFTA Guru – YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMcXrAPmchk Transcript: Macaron I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, welcome to the BAFTA and BFI International Screenwriters lecture series for 2013. I was on the BAFTA film committee and discovered I was the only screenwriter who'd ever been on it. And after I got over the shock, I decided that the best I could do for my screenwriting brothers and sisters was to set up a lecture series in the name of BAFTA and we were able to bring the BFI in on that. This year we got a fantastic lineup, we start with David Eskoyer, we end with Richard Curtis and in between we have Hosseina Minis, Susanna Grant and Tony Gilroy. These are serious heavy weights from the UK and from America. You will be inspired by these individuals. We have been trying to get Richard Curtis since day one of day one. So this is a huge pleasure because I had begun to give up hope that we would ever manage to lure Richard in. If you ask someone in the street to name a famous screenwriter, they probably couldn't, but they might come up with Richard Curtis. That's how famous he is. And if you look at his filmography, you're looking at the list, not the list, the list of the best selling British films of all time. He's almost created a genre of his own and has written a mirror that holds itself up to us as British people. One of the keys to the success of the series is that we don't give up on those we love and even though they come up with very, very good excuses, we just don't accept that. So it's a particular pleasure to have Richard Curtis closing the series because tonight we have some serious heavy weight writers in the audience. And I am really looking forward to hearing what he has to say. This is almost my first lecture or the other lectures I've ever given of being to my children. And I'm still doing the washing up. So I'm not exactly convinced of the efficacy of the lecture form. And also I do also want to say that everything that I say will only be partially true or as it were only true for me, which is a really important thing. I'm screenwriters on the whole don't talk to each other about what they do. For instance, I've always think it's a clever thing to leave myself notes for the next day. So I've never woken up and started writing with an empty page in front of me. There may be other people for whom the empty pages absolutely key. Without it they couldn't as it were, feel the challenge. I write enormous amounts. I write 20, 30 pages of stuff a day and hope that some of it's good. There may be other people who do the exact opposite who care about every word and don't put it down until they're sure it's right. So I seriously don't know what's right or wrong. All I can do is tell you what's true for me. And the first bit now is going to be of the evening. I've decided to use like inspiration, Jeremy Paxman. And because I'm just going to ask myself the same question a few times and try and give a few different answers. And the question is why I'll be answering that. And then I think Edith and I have agreed that we might talk about how, as it were, about the process as a little bit more and then you can ask whatever you like. The first question that I asked myself is why did I start writing films? And the answer is because someone called Michael an American asked me to write a film. So I got a phone call from my agent saying he wants to see you tonight. And I thought of the idea for the film that I was going to sell him on the Northern line. And that was the first big mistake that I've never made again, which is that I always have lived with the idea of any film that I'm going to do for at least a year before I eventually start writing it. Films can't be in factuations. They've got to be relationships. And I suppose this is my first observation that I think the difference between having a good idea for a film and a finished film that you like is the same as seeing a pretty girl at a party and being there when you're wife delivers the third baby. It's an incredibly long journey. And a good idea is only the tiny little spark at the beginning of this immense process. I came up with the idea for Michael. It was about a father and a son who both found out on the same night that the girls they were with, the girlfriend and the wife were having sex with other people. And so they both as it were left their flat and their house and moved in together in a hotel and had to as it were deal with their peculiar situations together. And it was called four eyes and fat thighs. And I think that's the only thing I really got out of it because that's weirdly close to four weddings and a funeral. So it was the first and then I wrote a draft. I went out to L.A. and I wrote a second draft under the producers E. Goli in his guest room and then he put me together with a director with whom I wrote a third draft and then we handed it in and we had what I think is quite a typical American meeting. They loved the script. They really loved it and I asked them did they have any reservations at all because their smiles were so big and they said the dialogue wasn't great. It was to English and a bit too formal. And I said, all right, then they said that the two leading characters were not good because they were both weak and they needed someone to be able to root for in the movie. And then they said, and obviously the jokes are all very English. So we'd have to think of jokes that would appear more to an American sense of humour. And then I remember saying to them that really only leaves the title and they said we hate the title. But the strange thing was they still said, can't wait to get the next draft. So I went home. I was staying with a friend of mine by the stage because I was sorted out of the nose breakdown. I got a self-induced temperature of 103 about a week later. I flew home to England and met a girl in May as sued me in perpetuity. I never delivered the script and that explains pretty well everything about what I have done since then. First, never do a project that you haven't thought about beforehand. Be sure of that you're working with people who actually like the work you do, which I think is hugely important. Choose the people you work with really carefully. This director was a lovely man but I remember when we were talking about the film the very first day. He said, oh, I so I don't know if I would have this film. When my wife left me, I'd just went out and had sex with a different girl every night for a month. And this was a film about two men who don't have ever had sex with one person in their entire lives. So he was completely and utterly the wrong man to be making this film. But most importantly, and this isn't a rule for everyone, but it sort of is explains everything since then. I decided that I would never write a film about anything that I didn't really know about very personally. I didn't know. I realized when I was writing the film where American shopped, I didn't know what they'd watched on TV when they were kids. I didn't know anything about the structure of their schools. So I came straight home and I wrote a film called Count Townboy, which was eventually called the Torguei about someone who lived in Count Town where I lived about someone who had Heifever, which I had, and about someone who's job was to be a straight man to a comedian whose name was in the script, Ron Anderson and my job was to be Rowan's straight Rowan Act in straight Ram. So I have always since then basically stuck to what I think is true to my experience and emotionally right for me. So that's why I started on a career of small personal English films. And it was absolutely key. And I think the other thing that was key in the development of myself as a screenwriter was one sentence in William Goldman's fabulous book called Adventures in the Screen Trade, which I would recommend anyone who hasn't read to read, where he said that most directors end up making films that vaguely remind them of a screenplay that they once read. And it's that sentence is the stake of fear through my heart that's dominated everything I've done since then. The next question I've asked myself is why so many of the films or the films have generally turned out as I hoped they would. And this is quite a complicated and odd thing. And I didn't realize as it was going to be the core of what I was going to say when I was asked about, and I thought, oh well, I'll write about playing lots of pop music while I'm writing. But on the whole the films that I've worked on have turned out as I intended. And I don't know how replicable it is and I don't know if my experience is very personal. But I would say that from my point of view a huge amount of the challenge facing a screenwriter is about control. And that is a very important trickieria. When it came to four weddings, I decided I was going to take it even more seriously. We made a deal that we, me and Duncan, would be involved in every part of the process of making the film, which meant being there when it was being cast, being there every day when it was shot and being there a lot of the time when it was being edited even though not all the time. And so strangely for me in the end I decided simply in order to stay alive that I would take to directing myself, which obviously comes with pluses and minuses. I am probably the worst director that I've worked with. But at least I know what I want and and how it should be and that it will be accurate. What you've got to be very careful, I'm particularly aware of how horrible it is to have a stubborn writer in the edit and I hope that I'm more ruthless in editing my own films than anyone else could possibly be. Certainly that's been my experience. I'm always saying take out more. But I do feel that you should as a writer if you can try to be there when it's done because you don't want to waste your life making or having other people make the wrong films. And now the final bit, which is the most surprising bit to me of all and I've only it's been made seem odd to you but I only started to think about it for days ago is why I have actually written the films that I've written at all. I suddenly thought why have I written this bunch of films instead of another bunch of films? I've said here when I thought of first writing movies, these were my favorite 10 films. Godfather one, Godfather two, the Avengers of Robin Hood, Doge Day off to noon, Emmanuel one, Emmanuel two, white Christmas, closing cows of the third kind, animal house and a street kind name desire. And it never even occurred to me that I could write anything like any of those films in the same way that often you end up marrying someone who's not the slightest bit like you. But there was another bunch of films which for some reason or other I felt I could identify with and could do something like and I'm interested in why I thought that, why I didn't think I could do the other type. And the strange thing to me is that I wrote my first film when I was 30 and I really ended up the key things that I've written have been on the same subjects about they've been about love and they've been about friendship and they've been about family. And thinking about tonight I've been as puzzled as some of the people who are very critical of my films are why I would bother doing it again and again and again. And I've tried to think about this. Why have I not gone down a lot of other routes? And I've taken a bit of consolation. I've got a second slide here from thinking about artists and I'm not comparing myself with these. But I don't know if you've got sugar. There are lots of cities and lots of you know cafeterias and lots of soup cans. But every time he sat down he thought, oh I know, I'll make everything a bit blue and put some flowers in it and on the whole people it'll be jumping over houses. And then if we just go on and look at the other two, oh there we go. Must have led a life of great variety but every time he put pen to paper, these people. And then just the last one, there we go. Really? Oh, I mean, all you thought, he must have been able to see there were other ways of going about things. But for some reason or other and I do think that there is a thing about style, you know, as it were brushed to paper and pen to paper, which is the thing that you do and there's probably not much that you can do about that. And so I've just been thinking that it must be the reason I've written all these films. There's because the things that I feel most deeply must be about those subjects in my own life. So I was raised in a family that was full of love. That's what was the big thing in my youth was as it were family love. And all the big emotions and all the big things that I felt have been in this area in the area of romantic love, family love, friendship and not as it were in the area of serial killers, superheroes, people who died 300 years ago, secrets, scandals, corruption, action, sporting victories, gangsters, things from outer space. All of these things that are a few gentrists to other people and take up their time were clearly not being the thing which inspired me. I've just written a lot of times about love, friends and family because it would seem that if you really write what you care about, you as it were, have no choice. And that must be why I've really written about anything else. Maybe that takes me back to the beginning. All the mistakes I made on the first firm, I found that what I do best is when I write what is true to me, what I understand. And I hope that I have listened in more ways than one, to my own instincts and my own heart. And at least for the moment, that's my explanation why I've ended up writing the things that I have. We're off. Are you ready to really push control slightly? Yes. Good. Glad to hear that. Have you got all the clips I told you that we must have really... Thanks, so they're already with Big Red Botan up there. Yeah, we're ready, we're good. Before we get to the clips, we've got to start with the question on how, how you approach writing a screenplay. I mean, just very quickly on that. I've been trying to think, how do I write a screenplay? Because I certainly don't sit down in a month or two months. I think the answer is, I think of an idea ages before. And then I kind of write a long, weird, prose poem to myself with lots of bits of dialogue in it, which is just a discussion. So I say, this might happen in the middle of these, might be the characters. This might be the end. This might be the beginning. I mean, I would never write a treatment, by the way. I think they are... shockingly bad idea. I genuinely think that a treatment is the equivalent of a prose description of a painting. I think I will draw a picture of a pretty woman with a landscape behind her and you're not quite sure whether she's smiling or sad. That's the Mona Lisa. But I genuinely think they're nonsense. So I would have never done that if I can. And then slowly, I kind of, I then I think I'd write down on cards, incidents that are in it and see whether or not, suddenly I've got 100 things that start to be in an order that's vaguely sensible. And then I will start having a go at writing. I find it really fascinating when you were talking in your lecture about how involved you are. I mean, is that quite a unique thing for a writer who's not the director of a film to be that involved through that whole process? I think it is, but we've made it work and it's been complicated. I mean, I think I really do think of my job as a screenwriter being pretty well equal. And I mean, actually, obviously, if you'll then direct in the movie, that bit's equal. My contribution to the directing of the movie was not as important, I think it's very important to be there. But I think the editing of films, again, it really is a massive rewrite. And it is a extraordinarily important part of the process. And I can't, if I could take you guys through time to see how disastrous at least four of the films that I've been involved in have been when they were thought to be finished. It is, I mean, Bridget Jones was catastrophic. Yeah. And the movie we shot, even though every single frame of it was then in the finished movie, it was not the right movie. We just got all sorts of things wrong in the screen play. Like there were two laughs in it in the whole film. And some of you who may have seen it recently and think that's more than I remember, but in front of a crowd, it used to get some laughs and we just, we were going completely the wrong reaction of the film. And then suddenly one day, we realized that the problem was that Bridget has presented on film was a pretty girl in a good job who both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth wanted to sleep with. And it was not a challenging scenario one where somebody deserved a much sympathy or interest. And so what we did quite near the end is we took the saddest scene in the film, which was right at the end when she'd been dumped for the third time by Mr. Darcy or I can't remember where it was, but it was the last five minutes or ten minutes in the movie. And we made it the credit sequence of the film. So I think it might be interesting to look at the credits of Bridget and see that the reason why people then were sympathetic and liked the film. I mean we did then cut 15 out of the next 30 minutes to try and speed it up and stuff. But the credits of this film, this was the emotional climax and end of the film until as it were she ran through snow. The strange thing is that is two, her emotion is two big for a opening credit sequence I think. Now you can see how that would have been quite near the end of the movie with her and real trouble and really, really saddened everything. But by moving that up, we changed the fate of the more swimming watch and that we go, I did that maybe about a month ago. The characters almost have, you know, do you do associate characters with certain pieces of music then as well whilst you're writing? It's a good that, it's a good that far. I don't know that it's character as much as emotional moods. Talk of emotional moods if you want to get to a point with something, do you feel like with film and with screenwriting you need to find a journey to get there as opposed to just seeing things as they are. Because you've got a great example of you just from noting hell of this the scene with Julia and you of all of all. I've actually got my pocket, my hints and if you've got time, I've got to have it as I might just tell you as it were, things tricks that I use which I'm sure will not be useful to most of you but interesting. I mean, I'd just be honest. One of the things that I found in most of my films and I was a bit torn between an example I could have given you for almost every film that sometimes when I'm stuck on a film completely and trying to work out what to do and feeling that I haven't got there, and this will unfortunately destroy the scene that everyone's about to see. But I just write exactly what the film is about in what people say. It's so often, I think it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a tradition. I actually won't, I won't quite ever say, well I let people maybe imply vaguely what the emotional journey was meant to be. And I'm quite a believer in going straight for it. So, I mean this is a, this is a, you know, key scene in Notting Hill but if you listen to it again, again, you're a discriminating audience, you probably thought the first time you saw it. Wow, this is exactly him saying what the film's about, but this was me writing straight at Notting Hill to try and say what I thought the film was about. I live in Notting Hill, you live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name. Fine. Fine, good decision. Good decision. The famous thing isn't really real, you know. And don't forget, I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. So, well, I'm just saying there is that was a piece of work, you know, a very deliberate thing to try to exactly sum up what I thought the whole film was about. How do you know when something's funny? That's quite interesting. You do laugh when you write something funny. I mean, and that is really interesting because when we wrote Blackouter, I used to notice that because Blackouter was quite, you know, constructional, you know, you'd kind of knew what people would do and how the plot would go. And you could make things funny in a way. And there were quite a lot of things we did repetitively. And whenever I actually laughed, I would underline things. So, I would remember that actually made me laugh rather than something that I worked towards. And at the end of the whole process, Ben said, what was funny lines that used to be underneath the script? So, he'd obviously never noticed. They were the funniest lines that I'd ever read. Okay, questions from our audience. You mentioned your own family background. And whereas most family backgrounds that are mentioned are bad memories for the person telling you about them, you refer to a close and loving family background. My question is, if you had not had that kind of family background, does it mean that you simply would not have become a screenwriter or would you think have written films with influence from the kind of awful background you'd had becoming a parent? I realize in retrospect, I'm very interested in things going well. I think there is a, it's a real, it would be interesting to talk with people who disagree because I find things going well, very, very interesting. And I know that there are lots of people who when they see a situation, look for the thing that's wrong and say that's the truth. And when I have said before, that I'm sometimes puzzled by the fact that when I write films about people falling in love, they are critically taken to be sentimental and unrealistic. And yet, 4 million people in London are in love tonight and today all around the world hundreds of thousands of people will fall in love. When someone writes a film about a soldier getting a wall and breaking into a flat and murdering a young pregnant woman, something which has happened twice in history, that film will be described as seringly realistic. I don't see how that's true. I was on a beach in Southworld the other day. And you look along, you see fathers playing with their children, people in love holding hands, older couples having cups of tea with each other, no sign whatsoever of ruthless violence and hatred on that beach. Now of course I know from my work with comic relief about the dark art of the UK, but that's not the only story and I think stories of joy and love are definitely worth worth telling. And I'm a beneficiary of that. And long may tell them. APPLAUSE We feel we let you go. Can we have your tricks of a dream or what to have these? We've got our eyes. So I did just write them down. These are absurd. I cannot believe. I'm going to say this in front of me. Most books are the ready. I can't believe I'm saying this in front of Christopher Hampton. I live in a street with only two houses in the street. And I'm the second best writer in the street. And the third best director, as my son Charlie now knows more about what if I written here? I'm not going to say that. I want you all time. I've said the thing about going on the nose. Oh, this is just a hint of mine, which I do think is helpful if you're a writer. Is when I get stuck, which is often, I always write 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the gap on the page. And then I give myself five goals at the problem. So I don't have that dreadful pressure of thinking, I've got to get it right. There's time, what is he going to say to her, what can they do? I just write something that's the same as the thing I wrote before, something that's a bit different. Something that's completely different, something with another character and something from our spaces at web. And by the time you've relaxed enough to write the five, you often find that somewhere in the five is the answer that you need, whereas the pressure of having to get it right, I find very hard. To get right was book often. No, I mean, I get completely stuck. And that's when I start typing and sit down with a pad and write impensal. So I can't see what I'm doing. This is bad thing to reveal, but I do. I have to admit that I do sometimes at certain points, right, as I say, like a mixing desk. I've got to a certain point and I can see it's all a bit fungi. And so I say, if you've ever been in a studio when they're making a record, it's so annoying, because they turn up the sacks and then they fiddle with the sacks for two hours. And you say, oh, god, this is all going to be sacks. The whole thing. And then they fix the sacks and then they pull it down and it rejoins the track. And I do have some days where I just say, I've just got to do plot. I'm sure there's something wrong. So I just do plot. And then the next day, I've taped down the plot and lift out the character. And I get characters, why don't you talk and do each other convincingly. And they talk to each other all day. And then when I fix that, I reintroduce that. And then I'll do jokes and other day. I said, just isn't funny enough, and I'm going to go through it all and try and do that. So that's another, as it were, workmen like trick that I do. Never leave a black page in the morning. This is the most important one of all. Don't call your boys by girls names and your girls by boys names. It's so annoying when you read a script and the husbands call Carol and the wife's called Alex. And the whole way through the film, you can't remember who why. And then for some reason, her other Alex is giving birth to somebody and stuff. So you can change the when the actors have faces. You can call them whatever you like, but in a script, call them by names that are identified by the right sex. This was a card just to say, if anybody ever talks about the death of romantic comedy, I think that should be ignored because I think good romantic comedies are funny films about love. And I would say this decade we've had lost in translation, 500 days of summer, a tunnel sunshine at the spotless mine. These are great great films about love. Probably better than in the 10 years before they were, all the 10 years before that. So I think it's just a question in terms of movies about love of rephrasing it and not just going by by a formula. And then the most important one of all, oh no, here's one, not very important one. Which is if you're a writing comedy and you want to make something funnier, the web way to do it is go to where it's already funny and make it a bit funny at the mad. So in Notting Hill there's a scene where Hugh goes in and he's pretending he's from horse and hound and he interviews due to and when Tim Bevan gave me his note that he's given on every single film I've ever written, which is not very funny is it. Then I went to that bit and I thought, okay, so he comes out and I knew that bit was funny and I thought, how can I extend that bit rather than finding another bit where I make it all funny? So I thought what would happen if we came out on the corridor and then we said, now you can talk to everybody else. So that's just a little practical comedy hint. And then this is the last one I've written where I say love yourself 99% failure is a triumph. And I often do think that I think when I'm talking to people who are writing and they say, if I write and there's one good bit that is an extraordinary day and I will think I'll end it and I'll think I've really got that bit and wouldn't it been my I can see that being in the final film and I know that many young writers they write and they say it's all shit and then they say, I mean there was one bit there might be okay but the whole day was dreadful and you've got to just reverse that and see that if you've produced anything that's of worth in terms of the life of writing a film because films are quite quick to write because they're just dialogue you could type out a film in three days you couldn't type out an novel in three days but you should be proud of hope full of observant for anything that's anything that's good. Which I thank you so much for tonight could have been very helpful for the film. Video: Richard Curtis - Exclusive 'About Time' Interview (2013) | Rotten Tomatoes – YouTube https://youtu.be/74mMMMnjZjw Transcript: Yes, great-ray course and hound magazine. Oh, my goodness! It may be you see that film again. There's a castle made of horse and hound. And when I saw it, they'd done the front cover and they'd misspelled the word millennium. No. So it's gone a little leaf. I took a leaf off. I put a plant next to it. Took a leaf off it and put the leaf over the mistlete of millennium. Yes. This is going to sound strange. But there's this family's secret, but the men in the family can travel in time. This is such a weird joke. Your movies are responsible for so many warm fuzzies in my life. I was looking through them all and I mean, for God's sake, even it's not even just the specifically romantic ones. You don't war horse has that element. Right? Yeah, it's just even I will tell him that he's good at warm fuzzies. Yes. I, as far as I'm concerned, I'm a huge fan and I think that you're sensing that as I sit very close to you. I want to know like what is your idea of the most romantic date that you could be on? I was mess up romantic days. That's the point. There's a scene in love actually where he goes and we then can go outside care as door and he's got a course there. And I remember writing five ideas for that. I'm going out into my office where there were four girls typing and saying which of these is a good idea. And then I did the first one. They went, ah, the second one. Yeah, no, I'd hate the guy and then fortunately one of them, the cars, one, they said, oh, maybe that'll be all right. So just because I write about it doesn't necessarily mean I'm any good at the romantic things myself. Okay. And I think the thing that made my life turn out all right was realizing what sort of person I should be going out with. I remember driving along in the car and saying I must stop trying to go out. I must go out with someone talkative. Ah, that makes sense. That's the most important thing ever. A beautiful moment in anybody's life when they realize the partner that they're looking for. Yeah. I like that. Have you ever had a particularly memorable New Year's Eve like in the film? A good Orbad. Oh, New Year's Eve was always so awful for me. I mean, so, my main memory of New Year's Eve is like my daughter, my parents cracking in about 11, 30 and saying, do you mind if you go to bed? And then going in and kissing my mum and she used to wear cold cream. And when you kissed her, you would fall off her face onto the arms and the pillow. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve just like the ones there. And they would play charades and at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve. Just like the ones there, and they would play charades. And at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. So that New Year's Eve has always been so depressing for me. Well, and you get a chance to kind of make these things into fantastic films, I see, from the stories. Well, I do in the end end up writing about things that I care about. And thus, post love and family and friendship, but being the things that have got me through. Not, I'm superheroes and great sporting occasions. Would you say that you learn from something and situation in the right about it? Or backwards? You write about it and learn from that. Such a good question. Then this case and this fellow, I tried to write myself into a corner where I actually think about what the film is about, which is enjoying a normal day.\\"","completion":"**Title: The Narrative Craft of Richard Curtis: An In-depth Analysis** **[Opening Frame]** [Cut to a montage of Richard Curtis's films—rain splattering on a window from \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" a bustling London street in \\"Notting Hill,\\" and the iconic cue card scene from \\"Love Actually.\\" Soft, sentimental music plays in the background.] **[Voiceover]:** \\"In the world of cinema, few screenwriters have carved a niche as distinct and warmly regarded as Richard Curtis.

Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. (dramatic music) - Where we're going, we don't need roads. (dramatic music) - Mr. Curtis, an honor to see you again, sir. How are you? - I'm very happy now. It's, you know, it's pitch black here in England. - It'll be pitch black in Chicago in about four hours. So we're right behind you, sir. I'm gonna jump into this. - We're ready for mulled wine over here. - Oh, always. I exist in a constant state of ready for that. I'm gonna jump into this. You know, for so many people, Christmas movies are a tradition. They watch the same ones every year. It's a comfort for many of us, but I want to know for the people who create these Christmas movies, whether you're writing or you're directing them, do you allow your own films to be a part of your Christmas tradition? Would you ever gather the family around and say, \\"All right, guys, it's time to watch 'Genie.' \\"All right, guys, gather the kids. \\"It's time to watch 'Love Actually.'\\" - I mean, I think they'd kill me if I said it was time to watch \\"Love Actually\\" again, but maybe this year. I mean, I don't know. Our family aren't getting together till, you know, December the 18th, and we might watch the \\"Genie\\" film this year if we can hold off. That is a possibility, even though it's a- - A battle between anything I've ever tried and Elf. And normally Elf wins. - I would always choose you, sir, over Elf, always. When you start talking about genies, I try not to ask cliche junket questions, but the concept of wishes is always gonna come up. So I'm gonna try to approach this from an angle that not everyone's doing. When you first put pen to paper and start writing a script, what is wish number one that you really hope comes true? - Wow, I mean, look. My friend Danny Boyle said that the secret behind movies, the only thing that matters in a movie, as he said, is the beginning and the end, and the beginning not so much. So the first thing I hope for is that the movie's got a good end. 'Cause no matter how hard you try, if the end's no good, everyone walks away saying, \\"I didn't enjoy that much.\\" And this movie started with the end. I kind of knew where it was going the whole way through. My wish is always that I'm not hoping the end appears, but that I start knowing with how it's gonna finish. - Can I just honestly tell you, and I wouldn't say this if I didn't believe it, it's a great ending. It's honestly, it's fantastic. So you crushed it. If I didn't believe so, I would just awkwardly move on to the next question. So you absolutely crushed it. - Thank you very much. - Yes, sir. You know, speaking of, you mentioned \\"Love Actually\\" before, 20 years since it hit theaters. And the thing I always say is that movies don't change. We change. The story that I loved two decades ago is different than the story I love now as an adult. So two decades later, what is the storyline that you see most differently? Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. Do you know, now that my life is sort of calmer, and now that I'm a gentle, older man, last time I watched it, I really loved the stupid story with Colin going to America. I thought I wasted my youth and I wish I was 27 again. So I'm sorry, I've got more shallow rather than more deep. - I just love just how that story turns out. The walking into the bar, it's brilliant. It still yields one of the biggest laughs every time one of the girls walks in. People think I'm crazy when I say this, but I truly believe that love actually is the reason that \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" has become the hit that it is, why it plays every year. Can you talk about using that song in the film and the impact you think love actually had on it? - I mean, don't say that anywhere near Mariah Carey. She's gonna sue you out of your job. But the truth of the matter is, I really listened to that a lot while I was writing the movie. You know, you're sitting in a dark office in the middle of March. and you're just dreaming about a movie. And that song is so irresistibly cheerful that I would sometimes like put it on a loop. So it was kind of the fuel behind the movie. So if I've managed to get rack up any extra sales from Mariah, I'm delighted. - Because God knows she needs it. - I don't think she needs it. - You know, it's, I feel like the sign of a good movie and it's the same case with \\"Genie\\" as well. But a sign of a good movie is when it's over years later, you're still wondering, I wonder what happened to those characters. I know we got a little bit of a follow-up on \\"Red Nose Day\\" but I'm sort of curious of all the \\"Love Actually\\" storylines, which one is the most that you find yourself wondering, where are they today, 20 years later? - Well, I mean, I think Hugh Grant would definitely be divorced. I don't think there's any doubt in that. I think what I do is I tick through them and say if any of them lasted 20 years. I think the naked couple would have lasted but Hugh would be onto his third wife. There's no doubt about it. - That's fantastic. I've got to tell you, swinging back around to \\"Genie,\\" there is a line in the script that literally made me spit out my drink. And it's when Melissa says about Jesus Christ being the son of God. I thought he was kidding. I've got to tell you, you have made lines that make me laugh, that make me cry. The \\"my son, my dad\\" moment from \\"About Time,\\" I crumble every time I watch that. So I'm sort of curious for you, I know you're sort of very close to all these projects, but what is the line or the moment you've written or directed in your career? that still has the most emotional effect on you when it's played out on the screen? Well, do you know, I think, I mean, there's a lovely line at the end of this one, you know, when Melissa says most people are cruel and selfish, but that was never you. And I think she did that phrasing. And I love that. I like the end of About Time, where he says, you know, life's a roller coaster, we have to relish this remarkable ride. That's kind of what I'm trying to do every day. Just see what's around you. Try not to hope for more and see whether you can just enjoy the texture of every day. I love that. Mr. Curtis, I asked for extra time with you just because I'm such a fan of you and your work. So in every word that you've put down on paper is a blessing to all of us. So I appreciate you giving me that time. And thank you for always doing just such incredible work that makes all of our lives richer, man. It was a real always an honor to speak with you. You're so sweet. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Bye guys.

It's an amazing show curated by this man here. This genius in front of us. Yes. The South Bank Centre, tickets available southbank centre.co.co.com. Can I say they are? It really is a case of well-stocks last. I think if anyone does want to go, they should like do it today. Oh, right. They're selling fast. Of course they are. Southbank Centre.co. What, what makes the question? How come, why wouldn't you run this for longer? Because people would go and see this for like a month. Well, I do have a little plan, which is that if it works out and if it turns out to be a kind of script that's reproducible, I would love it to be something that lots of theatres could do from year to year and maybe even schools could do and maybe they could even do an Australian America. It's kind of because some of the money is going to come at really. So the idea would be just like, you know, J.M. Barry, don't, don't, some of the money from Peter Pan always go to the great Ormans Street. All of it. All of it. So I've got a little hope that if it works out well, if we get as sufficiently enthusiastic and merry audience, that it might be something that lasts. J.M. That was, he was a guy I wasn't he. His story is unbelievable, isn't it? He was a single parent, wasn't he? And he carried on writing was a great dad, wrote all these amazing stories and posthumously every single penny of profit from his estate goes to great Ormans Street. Did you think I should do that? I think it's worse than done. You're not following me, or leader. Okay, I should give nothing to charity after I die. Richard, I think you've done you bit by the way. I mean, a lot of health from you. We've had some fun over the years. We sold the Queen's car last year on the way. We sold the New Times, just a couple of days ago, children need something. Congratulations, I think. But that was so far. Well, more than the mutual party. That was Matthew's idea. Yeah, what's this? So you got a car frame, I said, I know, but I think we're dealing it on. Anyway, this is great, man. And how much you love Christmas, I attend? You still have full on 10? Yeah, I'm still full on 10 because it is. You know, I've just made this genie movie. And the genie movie is all about, you know, you get a genie. You could have anything in the world, but the thing that you most want really is just have a lovely meal with your family. And Christmas forces my family, who many of them are fled to America. To come home and it's the one time we see them. And I like Turkey. Right before. Before. So by the way, I love Turkey. I want to have it more often. Yeah, don't you? Well, I want to have it more often. I want to have it both out of cold. Yeah, I love it. I love it. Picked. To win right now, pull off. Poor us, cafe. Our on mile a bone, Lane. Just takes how much is now. We should go ahead and neck. We should go after this. Yeah. Before we move on, just one more plug for this. Christmas actually, Southbank Center's Royal Festival Hall, 70, 11th December. Lots of the province going to comet relief. It's a great show. This man in front of us curated it. He noticed his Christmas trees. There are lights. There's smoke. There's mystery. There's even a scary bit in it. Southbank Center. Yeah. So what is the arc? It just give us the elevator pitch of the arc of the tale. Well, no, no, it's not a story. Right. It's a misson and a knee. So you come on and you think, what's going to happen? And then everything happens. And we get literally all my favorite things. We like to tell four Christmas stories. There's the Christmas in the trenches story. There's the bandage story. There's the story about how a polo eight went around the moon on Christmas day and took the first pictures of the, you know, that we've ever seen of the earth from space. We went to the moon, but we discovered the earth. And then flowing, Joan, who are those brilliant comedy, they're going to come on and play. And I guess, star rocks up and gives presents to the audience. I mean, I think anybody who comes and isn't entertained wasn't alive when they entered the building. Yeah. Okay. That's great. So those four stories, that's why it could roll out. I was wondering how you're going to roll it out if you don't have a story, but that's how come. Yeah. And the songs are written in the song. Yeah. I mean, there is some fantastic, we've just been to this thing with the, if we're going to at the end of it, we're going to sing all I want for Christmas is you. And I've got the members of the cast of the film, filmed them holding up the lyrics in the same way as Andrew Lincoln held up the card. So you can sing along and they'll be Bill Nye and Andrew Lincoln. I mean, here are nightly and stuff. So it's full of gimmicks. There's a little bit of Charlie Mackenzie in there. You know, it's going to be, I think it'll be gorgeous. Just briefly on Bill Nye's role. Yes. I mean, love actually. Yes. He was first engaged for the read through as a reader. And that is an accepted role in acting in the world of acting. And you are, you, you accept that role on the understanding that you're not, you're not auditioning for the film. You're merely helping the writers to get the script right. I've seen him on stage. I hadn't liked him. He rocked up there because we were thinking of casting two other people. Couldn't decide who this is true. Bill turns up. Does it so perfectly? He gets a laugh for every line. We cast him five minutes later. And I've, every film I've done since then has been in. Wow. And it was a really, really lucky day. Who were the others for me? I've never revealed them. But they were. Just a can't remember them. You're six years. Actually, I think one of them was Robby Cole train for instance. Okay. I mean, he wouldn't mind you saying that. Well, he's not a lot of other people. I know. I know I'm aware that he's deceased. I know that go wrong. It's going so well to them. It's not a point. A gene. Well, but life is a rich mixture of sorrow and joy. And we're just trying to pump up the joy. Pump up the joy, man. Pump up the joy, pump up the jam. So, Jeannie, this film, sorry. Listen, McCarthy. Yes. Now, the last time we exchanged emails in the middle of the night, I think you were off to direct her or something. Well, I wasn't directing, but I was thinking of that to eat the craft table. You're a parachute to didn't work. Something happened. All right. So, what is Jeannie? How did it come about? How happy are you with it, etc. I'm doing it all the work here. Aren't these the, you ask your questions now. Well, you're telling me some stuff. It's the last time I fired the shark tell me about this before. I think it's the big piece. It's a very funny and joyful film. It's based on a film I originally made with Alan coming. Lenny Henry and Drone Accumson. Alan coming has aged. He was like 25 then. He's now 55. And he's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's like 25 then. He's now 55. And he is playing the villain. I saw he's playing the villain's part in it. But the Jeannie is now played by Melissa McCarthy. She is fabulous. I mean, she's such a sweet woman and a funny woman. Many comedians are cool. You know that. You've come across them. But she's so gentle and so all the emotion in this story. She carries. But she's also hilarious and very amusing. The dress and Papa SEA do one of Britain's greatest actors. The greatest handler to his generation is playing Burnett. And his life is going very wrong. He rubs a box outpops Melissa McCarthy with hilarious consequences for a burn hour. And then there's like a sad bit where it turns out their best friends ever. And then there's a happy bit where everything turns out well. So this is all on Sky. Sky is from the first of the family called Jeannie. Tell us about the world of proper movies. Not straight to video movies as they were once straight to TV movies as they would be now. But proper movies now getting their first their premiere on domestic platforms. Tell us about that world. How that's changed filmmaking. Well, I mean, I don't we try this hard on this. I've tried on any other. That's what I mean. That came out. So I think the truth is that it's just a kind of different kind of quality control. You know, they make a lot of movies for streamers. A lot of them people don't not many people watch. We hope that millions of people watch this. When you try as hard as you possibly can, the budget was actually great. I mean, one of the reasons I did this movie is I wanted to make a Christmas movie set in New York. You know, because all my movies are set in the street where I live. Basically, I'm sheer laziness. But I wanted to make a movie that had a wide shot of the Empire State Building in it. That's literally true. But I think that's true. It's actually the not in the street where you live. The street down from where you live. So you can still get to sleep at night. Yeah. And when I wrote Notting Hill, I sent out the location fighter to come up with the house. That a huge grant's character could live it. And he came back with one Polaroid photograph. And it was of the my front door. And I thought that's a joke. But it turned out to be right. But unfortunately, they then built use flat at Pinewood. I think, well, shut up. Yeah. I don't remember which. So I still had to travel into work. That house came up with a cell a couple years ago again. Did it? Your house, yeah. Yeah, I should never have sold. It was beautiful. What a beautiful house. No. So, yeah. So we flew to New York. We filmed in the snow. We filmed. We also snowed. What's your snow like? I'm not going to reveal that in case it breaks the magic for the viewer. But then quite a lot of it's been added. True lies. I think true lies snow was salt. Salt is the best, isn't it? I don't know. I noticed that some of the snow was just sort of fabric. Right. Yeah. In the distance it's fabric. And then some of it's some of it's. Oh my goodness. So even Richard, even at the age of you are, you still have a bucket list of movies to be made and where to make them and why. Yeah, I think I should make the thing I'm thinking about is I think I should make them slightly funny a version of the life of Napoleon. I feel that really. I've seen it. Yeah. But I feel probably not as many gags. Not as many. Not as many hype gags as I think I would. You did anything I think I would go for. I mean, you have previous as far as that's concerned. Oh my goodness. I was talking to you now last night about you coming on today. Because we were playing the Beatles. So last night we had, um, there's no night. It's just no night. At T-Tama in a Monday, it's a good day. It's about 14. Right. To the back half six. And, um, he was playing some Beastie boys yesterday. And he said, how could of the Beastie was? I said, yeah, I know. But can you imagine them rocking out to the songs in period having just written them? I mean, they're great now. But in the kings of the world, then. And then we had, there was a quantum leap. I think we went somewhere else. We went to, there's a particular Beastie boys on which is the most downloaded, I can't remember the name of it. It's not quite for you right. But, um, and it sounds for all the world. Like, I thought it sounded like Joy Division and the level of Terrors of Part that began in a sense. I said stick on Joy Division. One of those great conversations. You know, when you stand out, they're the best, right? I know. And he'd never heard of Joy Division. And then, and then we put on level of Terrors of Part. And then he said, it doesn't, it's a satisity. Will in a minute. He said, oh, yeah, I get what you mean. And then he said, but this sounds like Pimbo. Where's it? On Ghost Pimbo, where's it? He then he asked me about the Beatles and about guitars. And I said, well, no, a lot of the Beatles songs. Um, if you listen to the, um, the demos on, uh, for example, the anthology, which is amazing. So, so Richard, we stuck those on. And I was literally weeping. I was sobbing because of the beauty of. If you listen, if you hear the demo of, um, George Harrison's Walmart guitar gently weeps, you know, and he wasn't, he, he was no one near the best songwriter in the Beatles. You listen to that song and that vocal. And his original acoustic guitar, it will break your heart into a million pieces and you don't know why. And I still don't know why. But I had to be reassembled to go and pick you like that. But I had past six. Anyway, we get onto that and we're talking about you because you love the Beatles. We always have our Beatles conversations. And then I said, you know, notting hell. You won't, excuse me? And I realized he's not seeing nothing hell. Four weddings in the funeral. He's not seeing four weddings in the funeral. He's got this all to come. Well done, you. These films that young people don't watch. These films are great. Oh, okay. And they're seminal and they're at least. Well, that's very, you know, it's, I feel just very lucky. You write what you write. You hope that people like it. And then, you know, if they turn out to be repeatable, that is fabulous. And then, I did do that film yesterday, you know, which was sort of about the Beatles. And I've had some fun with my son recently. He used to be so against the Beatles, you know, absolutely wrapped generation. He said, Dad, they write nursery rhymes. He said, everything rhymes. They're silly little tunes. And now he's completely spun over. And I got a text from him saying, have you ever heard till there was you? Which is like the sweetest cover version by the Beatles and everything. So, you know, eventually they're going to creep into your soul. Well, he wasn't, he wasn't anti-Beatlers. He was anti-Dat. Yeah, I wasn't. Yeah, that's what that was. That'd be the same. And by the time you realised your mum and dad were right about the Beatles, you've got a kid who thinks you're wrong about the Beatles. Um, do you know, when I was little, the Beatles came to Sweden where I was living. And it was so, I mean, my parents were always so naive. It didn't occur to them. We were utterly obsessed by the Beatles. That if the Beatles come to Sweden, you could buy a ticket to see them play their music. Yeah. Just didn't occur to them. So, for four days in a row, me and my sisters would driven by my dad to stand outside the Ferresta hotel and wait for the Beatles to come out on the balcony. And we were there in the snow and finally the four of them came out and weaved to us. And that was the best moment in my life until now. Until you saw the peeing the playground. That's the best. No, I'm not going to talk about it. But that's your comedy philosophy. My comedy philosophy is repetition is a good thing. It's just like every joke that we have with our friends is a joke that we had with our friends, the day before and the day before and the day before. So, you've written this film, this Christmas film, based in New York, some of the And I'm before. The Napoleon film with Gags could happen. My very well-loved up and now you said out loud. What are the boxes you might want to take making? Because you said you were going to stop doing all this. You said that a few times. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Actually, it's quite interesting. I've got a... Someone's talking to me about this metaphor the other day that you can't... You can't leap onto a new trapeze until you let go of the one you've been holding. So, I'm actually aiming for one of those moments where I'm going to sort of stop not having any new commitments and then find out what, as a human being, I would like to do the new thing I'm going to grasp. What's going to come to you? Well, I'm thinking of poetry, Chris. No, you know. It's a piece of things. I might write a play. I'd like to be a DJ. I think that's really easy. Well, we did it by the way. I know that. I've heard that. I've got friends who are DJs. They never do any homework. They just ask you any old random questions. They say, what's happening, etc. etc. I think I could do that. Well, if you could do that. Then why did you employ a load of those as consultants on your film? They're both their rocks. Oh, okay. He's paid me once. He paid me once to be a consultant. A movie consultant. You have paid. Oh, we got it. You're so pretty. I think you're the film. You've just been the best. So might leave for that. With 30 years of service to come, I really feel like I've got my own back. Good. So what's the answer to the question? Seriously, I don't know. I think you've got to be a movie consultant. Maybe you find out. Still films, though. Well, I don't know. As I say, I think you might write a play. I might be getting involved in a musical. Oh, that says like it's happening. Please check your whole body line. Just change. I don't know. We'll have to keep some secrets. He's that I've got a secret. I've tried to encourage me. My now wife is trying to encourage me to write four funerals and a wedding. It's going to happen. Because we do go to quite a lot of funerals. And we just are arguing about... No, we're arguing about the wedding. Because I think the wedding should be a lovely wedding with young people. She thinks the wedding should be a death bed wedding. But I said, you know, one of those words were just as the guys about to concoat. He says marry me and then he dies as he's shoving the ring on the finger. So that would be four funerals and a funeral wedding. Well, exactly. That's where I think the weakness is. No, no, it's not a deal. Like being in the rightful stream, four funerals and a wedding. That's one of the funerals. But people think it's the wedding. But no, the wedding still comes. Because that's also the funeral. Well, no, no, you have three funerals. Then the wedding, then the other funeral straightaway. I disagree with you because she wrote for me. That's a great idea, though, isn't it? Well, I look. She used to have to pitch to people. Oh, did people say, please come in. Here's the door. Would you like to your coffee? Well, I think if I pitch then Napoleon, let's forget this. Just try the Napoleon thing on the back burner for him. Yeah, I mean, I've tended to have quite mainstream ideas. So it's often, you know, easier. But yeah, no, I don't get anything for free. And there's a brilliant young generation of filmmakers who are much much better than me. Have you seen Raelane? No. Oh, that's why I don't want you to see many movies as a used to it. Yeah, no, that's why I'm a bit silly and now. Movies. Just as you get older, yeah. So like, when I see the billboard if someone dressed up as someone. Right. You go, it just looks like you're dressing up party now. Unless they're a genie. Yeah, and it's not just what you're, you're films. Yeah, you have to be dressed like a Christmas. You know what I mean? Cause I used to love to suspend disbelief and dive straight in. But now, I mean, you know, movies like all quiet in the western front. Of course, of course. And I had, which we watched at the weekend, if you see Niyad, 24-5-7. Oh, the chain. Oh, that's really exciting. Do you know, I feel what you feel when I'm watching Subhiir and movies now? I think, oh, that's poor actor. You know, they've had to muscle up so much. And they're dressed like, you know, a child that I've had to dress party. Yeah. And they're having to have really slow, serious conversations about the end of the world. And I do, I do worry about them. But I saw this movie past lives recently. There's a beautiful. Starting. Can't remember either of the names of the actors. Big, big. No, it's a tiny little sort of career in the movie. No, no, no. And then you nickel a skidge, me be supposed to be nice as well. Yeah, my kids saw it. I was once at a stage. Hello. A skidge. Honestly, it was so exciting. That's actually his face. That's actually what his face looks like. A stage stage. We're going to finish with the Beatles now. And then, um, Thank you for coming in. You're amazing. Well, if anybody wants to see that show, see the show. If anybody wants to have a life of laughter, watch the genie. And if anyone wants to be happy for the rest of their lives, listen to Chris. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. I'm very, very, very, very, very. Oh. And if anybody wants to fund, should we make, look, let's go at war six, six funerals and four weddings. Oh, my God. Let's, let's make that show. Sounds like the new football football when everybody scores later goals. Var. Exactly. Var should appear. Right. Right. Let me do this properly. So, Christmas actually, the South Bank centres are all festival in London. A seventh till the 11th of December, Royal Festival Hall. Yeah. Yeah. South Bank Centre dot code of T.K. Book for that now. Genie is on Sky Cinema from the first of December. And four funerals and a wedding is going to happen. We were in the conversation. So technically we are contributors. So change your word, take a third or kind of stuff. Yeah. You'll be hearing from our people. And I could see you playing a priest. Tang what? A priest. A priest? No, a priest. I can see you. I can see you in the cameo. We've always planned. Cameo? Yeah. Cameo? Ha ha ha ha ha. All right then.

A very brief background of the writer and the films known for writing Richard Curtis - who was born in New Zealand and moved to London when he was 11 - has been one of the most influential, profitable, and talked about figures in British comedy. The talented 67-year-old has written more rom-coms than Sainsbury's stocks popcorn for with classics such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Love Actually all coming from his fair hand. In addition to the epic filmography, Richard also penned Blackadder, Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. When he's not tickling your funny bones, he is the co-founder of British charity Comic Relief along with comedian Lenny Henry. As if that's not enough for his CV, Richard Curtis has also been awarded a CBE by the Queen, won two BAFTAs and been nominated for an Academy Award... Is there no stopping him?!

Identify and define the writer’s approach to the screenwriting process? Curtis has described himself as the ‘luckiest man in movies’ for having the chance to write multiple redrafts – with the assistance of his partner Emma Freud – and the power to influence casting choices, select the director, and to intervene during the shooting and editing process. He has also made no denial that his scripts are largely based on his own career and personal experiences. He only writes ‘on something he was a hundred percent sure of and no one in the world knew more about than him’. Leggott J (2012) ‘Travels in Curtisland: Richard Curtis and British Comedy Cinema’, British Comedy Cinema, 184-195, Routledge. 3. What narrative structures and themes does the writer typically use within their writing and films? Curtis-ian elements of cinematic comedy were present right from the start. First, there is the classic “fish out of water” hero…Next, there is the “love interest,” a thoroughly modern young woman…And finally, there is the “last act dash”...Those same essential elements, held together by an apparently unceasing stream of jokes and one-liners... would be used by Curtis in his hugely successful romantic comedies. That there are enough narrative, thematic and tonal similarities between all of his major films to establish Curtis as an auteur is usually taken as a given...a philosophy about love and human dependency that had simmered throughout the entire Curtis oeuvre. Romantic comedy is the main genre, but Curtis injects social commentary and explores cultural clashes. He uses elements like pop culture references, music, and high/low culture clashes to generate humor and drama. (e.g., contrasting references to David Cassidy and John Lennon with the National Film Theatre in \\"Four Weddings\\") There's some variation in tone and style between films (\\"The Girl in the Cafe\\" vs. \\"The Boat That Rocked\\"). There's a recurring theme of the value and commoditization of art (e.g., \\"Bean\\" with Whistler's Mother painting).

What insights do they have to the screenwriting process? Curtis's insights into the screenwriting process highlight the importance of authenticity, personal connection to the material, and the power of collaboration. He values storytelling that resonates with audiences on an emotional level while incorporating elements of humor and wit.

Additional information: Screenwriter Richard Curtis's own experiences as a wedding attendee inspired Four Weddings and a Funeral. According to Curtis he began writing the script at age 34, after realising he had attended 65 weddings in an 11-year period. At one wedding he was propositioned by a fellow guest, but he turned her down and forever regretted it; accordingly he based the origin of Charles and Carrie's romance on that situation. It took Curtis 19 drafts to reach the final version. He has commented on director Mike Newell's influence; \\"I come from a school where making it funny is what matters. Mike was obsessed with keeping it real. Every character, no matter how small, has a story, not just three funny lines. It's a romantic film about love and friendship that swims in a sea of jokes.\\" Curtis chose to omit any mention of the characters' careers, because he didn't think a group of friends would realistically discuss their jobs while together at a wedding.

He is also the founder of the British charity Comic Relief. Richard Curtis is probably the most successful comedy writer in the world due to one of his many characters: Mr. Bean. He created the 15-show series with actor Rowan Atkinson and it has become one of the most successful British cultural exports in history with hundreds of millions of fans worldwide. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. His fascination with love stories began at age seven after he became infatuated with a girl who rejected him. He remained obsessed for two years. “I was always an absolute fool for love... somewhere deep inside, that is a problem,\\" he said, adding. \\"Definitely, there was some psychological freakery there.' At 13, he won a scholarship to private school Harrow, where he excelled, and left as ‘head boy’. He also won a place at Oxford University where he became friends with Mr. Bean actor Rowan Atkinson and they worked together on Atkinson’s Edinburgh Fringe show. After graduation, Richard co-wrote the British comedy classic Blackadder, which ran through the '80s with Atkinson as its star. The program also cemented the comedy careers of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. In 1989, Richard wrote his first comedy movie: The Tall Guy starring Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson. By the ‘90s he was a big name in British comedy and an international celebrity when his low-budget movie Four Weddings and a Funeral became a runaway success. He followed that with the first Mr. Bean movie, then broke box office records again with the Julia Roberts and Grant movie Notting Hill (1999). The hits kept on rolling though the 2000s as he has worked with stars such as Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Dustin Hoffman. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. Richard’s charity work started almost by accident. Like many others, he’d been deeply affected by Live Aid. “I happened to go to dinner and met a girl who ran a charity and was about to go out to Ethiopia,” he said. He went with her and found the experience ‘startling’. “I was there towards the end of the famine, but I saw things of such horror that I couldn’t stand by and do nothing. You’d have a situation where people were separated into different corrugated iron huts - one would have people who were going to die that night, the next would be people who were probably going to die - and the last hut was people who might just survive.” He never got over it. When he returned to London, he decided to do everything he could to make comedy contribute to aid - from stage shows, to TV, to merchandise, as if he were the CEO of a business. Comic Relief’s aim is to create a just world, free from poverty. That’s also the aim of the campaign group Make Poverty History, which Richard also founded. It’s a coalition of aid agencies and campaign groups that lobby to cancel Third World debt among other goals. He’s pointedly aware of the “slightly peculiar contradiction in my life between the Comic Relief side and the comedy writing side,” but has an explanation. “What we do on Red Nose Day is make things as funny as we can so that people can see the other side to all the sadness we show,” he said. “I suppose what we are fighting for is that everyone should have the privilege of leading a happy life and being able to laugh like the rest of us instead of being worried that their husband is going to beat them up or they are going to die of a mosquito bite.” Richard considers Comic Relief and Make Poverty History to be his main priorities even at the expense of his personal life. “I help edit almost every appeal film we do,” he said in 2019. “When I see a film about a child who hasn’t got a mosquito net, and the impact that makes, I’ll then write to Kiera Knightley and ask her to do something to help us scale the impact.”","completion":"**Title: Travels in Curtisland: Richard Curtis and the British Comedy Cinema** **[Open with sweeping shots of London, transitioning into clips from Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Love Actually.]** **Narrator:** \\"In the heart of British cinema, there lies a territory marked by laughter, tears, and the unmistakable touch of Richard Curtis.

Richard Curtis: Actually in terms of getting into the industry at all my dad who was quite a serious man said that I had one year of fooling around and then I had to enter the marketing department at Unilever and in my first year I and I think 546 pounds or something like that but I then luckily got my first TV commission and that got me through the door as far as he was concerned and I got an agent actually by someone seeing me performing up in Edinburgh I got very lucky just that some lovely keen American woman who was living in London liked my jokes I got started in television by hanging onto the coattails of Rowan Atkinson who when he was 20 was a genius and it was obvious that he was going to be a TV star and I was his closest friend and wrote things for him and so we drifted in as comedians tend to by doing stage stuff of our own up in Edinburgh and then did a radio show which the traditional radio for which was pretty poor and then started writing sketches for a sketch show which became not the local news and then I wrote for that for for series so it was a very traditional route and then from a sketch show I went into a sitcom and then from a sitcom I went into films. INFLUENCES Question: What film or programme has influenced you the most? Richard Curtis: John Cleese in many ways weirdly is the most influential person in my career because when I was young Monty Python was all there was 50% of your conversation with friends was just quoting Monty Python sketches so as it were like a generation before would have had the goons and the generation after might have had you know the young months as it were for me it was Monty Python and that's what made me interested in humor and started me writing sketches and then strangely the reason we wrote Blackadder was because Fawlty Towers have been so extraordinary that when I tried to write a modern sitcom it just looked so pathetic in comparison to 40 does that we only wrote historical one to avoid Fawlty Towers but the big influence on my films would probably have to be Woody Allen just because I so loved his films when I was young and he made films changed style and developed so quickly so you were always interested by what he was going to do next and he gave me the confidence to try different things and it was particularly for me had written silly sketches and a silly sitcom so Woody Allen did silly films when he started out at Scotland from sketches and ended up writing Annie Hall which was much closer to what I loved and the first film of his that I really loved so me then having the confidence to arrive for weddings may have been based on my passion for our confidence gained from Woody Allen. ADVICE Question: What advice would you give to someone starting out? Richard Curtis: My obvious piece of advice is to make sure you write or do what you really like there was a bit of a pressure on me when I started they would say you know British rails funny or you know dreadful sandwiches that you buy and M&S a funny write joke about that and I think it's really important to do what you think is interesting not what other people tell you might be interesting for me writing to sort of get work because you know that sort of work is popular as a disaster so I would say right from the heart and hope that somebody likes it as a sort of person in films I suppose my obvious thing would be to take every stage of the process incredibly seriously and I would say to get very involved so I had a script editor who's also my girlfriend who made me rewrite “Four Weddings” 19 times so I didn't just handed something that I thought might be okay it would be ruthlessly dealt with I then worked with a director who was obsessed by casting and the casting process took forever so actually once the movie had been cast it was almost made and then I think the final thing is that when you're editing you can fix most films I mean at least three of my films have been when finished the first really careful cut of being spectacular disasters really really bad failed movies and we managed just by determination and thinking you know things through in a different way to make them eventually work by hook or by crook so those are some of my pieces of advice.” Video: Script to Screen Red Carpet: LOVE ACTUALLY with Richard Curtis | Matt Ryan – YouTube https://youtu.be/NbYecUZHgy4 Transcript: “Interviewer: I have question for you when you when you take something like “Love Actually” which i love dearly uh when you have like a multiple protagonist how do you balance like you know the screen time could you you have to cut some things you probably really cared about you know because you have multiple characters to explore. Richard Curtis: Well “Love Actually” of all the films i've written is the one that turned out most wrong after we'd shot it so in fact i think it's very hard to judge what you've got to try and do is write good stuff for all of them and then actually remake the order and remake the dynamic of it once it's shot that's what we did on “Love Actually” the the script i wrote had all the same contents but in a completely different order to the finished film. Interviewer: So something like “Notting Hill” was a little easier for you basically two characters Richard Curtis: She walks into the room she kisses him she goes away but in this one it was like playing three-dimensional chess because after every scene you could put any scene from any of the other 10 stories. Interviewer: So and maybe on uh when you do an ensemble piece and it's more the director on set which we directed of course has a lot more to do trying to rework the script at the same time Richard Curtis: no no i think they've got a lot to do in the edit that would be what i have to say i think they've got a lot to do in the edit in some ways they're great fun to do because you only have to work for a week or two with each actor so they never see through you and realize what a bad director you are.” Video: Richard Curtis On Creating A Classic Rom-Com | Fast Company - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FENpwVe14MA Transcript: “INTRO: (00:00) - Seeing as how love is quite a big subject. And I often think about serial killers. There've only been about eight of them. And yet, there are about 100 movies about them. And yet, every day a million people are in love, so I can't believe that romantic films won't, sort of, stay at the core of cinema, in one way or another. (00:17) (cheerful music) NOTTING HILL - I do solemnly declare. - I do solemnly declare. - [Priest] That I know not of any lawful impediment. - That I know not of any lawful impediment. - Why I, Lydia. - [Groom] Why I, Bernard. - \\"Four Weddings,\\" which is thought of as a romantic comedy, I didn't see as that. I thought of it as a semi-autobiographical film about love and friendship. (00:51) I wasn't really aware that there was genre or a rule book. Then I became more aware, with \\"Notting Hill,\\" that that was what I was up to. Every Thursday, I used to go and have dinner with my friends, Piers and Paula. And I just thought, if I turned up at Piers and Paula's, if Madonna was my date, how would they react? Helen Fielding, who then wrote Bridget Jones, obsessive Madonna fan. (01:16) She would scream a lot and lose her cool. And neither Piers, nor Paula, would have any idea who she was. And that exact scene actually happens in \\"Notting Hill\\". - Last film you did, what'd you get paid? - 15 million dollars. - Right. - The curious thing about \\"Notting Hll\\" is that, even though Hugh had been the star, Hugh Grant had been the star of \\"Four Weddings,\\" I didn't want Hugh Grant. (01:40) I very specifically didn't want him. Because I thought it would so fantastic to have a complete unknown, which would really have made the movie be like a perfect mirror to the story itself. But we auditioned about 10 people, and I thought, oh god, I'll never find anyone who's any good. We might as well cast Hugh. (01:59) I'm quite embarrassed by \\"I'm just a girl, \\"standing in front of a boy,\\" because I clearly thought it was a good line. Because in the next scene, one of the characters says to Hugh Grant, \\"what did she say?\\" And he says, \\"oh, she's just--\\" - A girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. (02:17) - So I obviously thought, I better repeat it, like it was going back to the chorus, or the hook, in a song. BRIDGET JONES (upbeat music) Well, the terrifying thing about being involved in \\"Bridget Jones\\" was actually Helen Fielding, because she was my best friend; it was her book. And I'd actually read \\"Bridget\\" seven times before it came out because she gave it to me with every extra 50 pages. (02:40) We cast Renee, and we made the film. And then we had trouble editing the film. And Helen was full of, \\"that's not quite like Bridget. \\"This isn't quite right.\\" And then you realize the big revelation to making movies, that there comes a point where you've gotta stop thinking about your source, as it were, stop thinking about the script you've written, or the book that the script you've written is based on, and say our Bridget is Renee. (03:04) And the moment that we accepted that, and all the wonderful qualities that she brought to the film, some of which might not be the exact representation of the book, but was a fully-fledged, fabulous human. You then edit the movie towards what you've got, and that means that, in some ways, it's better for that, because you've got an embodiment of a special, cinematic Bridget, rather than an attempt to just reproduce what was in the book. LOVE ACTUALLY (03:33) ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ Where no one's ever gone ♪ - Yeah. - I mean, \\"Love Actually\\" was partly inspired by the fact that I had done these three romantic comedies before, and I, in fact, didn't want to write another one. The plot in that movie, of Hugh and Martine, was a whole film I thought of doing. (03:54) And the plot of Colin Firth's story was a whole film that I had intended to write. So, what I was trying to do was, it was push the romantic comedy genre as far as it could possibly go. And just take the three best scenes of 10 different films and shove them all together. The big inspiration was \\"Nashville,\\" a Robert Altman movie, and \\"Short Cuts,\\" a Robert Altman Movie. (04:17) Which are very standards to be aiming for, because these are two of my favorite movies of all time. These movies with a lot of plots are tough to do. \\"Love Actually,\\" in its first edit, was the third worst film of all time. I mean it was really the worst example I can remember of something which had worked brilliantly in a read-though, not working well. (04:39) So it was like playing three-dimensional chess, because any scene could go after any other scene, from any other point, in any of the other stories. So, that was very, very hard work. I was a new director. And if it had been a movie in which there was a cast who would've had 10 weeks to get used to me, maybe they would've got used to me. (04:58) But we only had one week per plot. So I felt I was auditioning for the actors every single week. What I realized was quite how unfair I'd been on the directors that I'd worked with beforehand. Because there's this terrible contradiction in movies, that a writer's got two years to fix absolutely everything, and then the director's got one day in which to shoot it. (05:21) And suddenly I understood why sometimes the directors had rushed through things I thought was important or been happy when they got it. Because I was always saying, oh, let's have another go, let's try it another way. - I'd only give one piece of advice to anyone marrying: try and marry someone kind. (05:39) - The original inspiration for \\"About Time\\" is the scene that most people talk to me about, which is the scene on a beach, when the leading character travels back to just spend an afternoon with his dad who's just died. And, almost for the first time in the movies, the idea I had was based on a visual thing. (05:58) And I remember starting now, at last, as a writer, to start to sort of think, well, what really matters about that scene isn't so much all the words that they're saying, but where they're standing, that it's a lonely street. So I think, at last, by \\"About Time\\" I was gaining a bit of visual confidence. (06:17) And I hired the cameraman from my favorite visual movie, called \\"Like Crazy,\\" that Drake Doremus made. And I started to think, if you want to fall in love with a character, then the words can do two-thirds of it, but if you can shoot it well, then maybe that's gonna be the thing which, as it were, goes into your heart without knowing how it got there. (06:42) ♪ Oh, I believe in yesterday ♪ - Oh my, when did you write that? - I didn't write it; Paul McCartney wrote it, the Beatles. - Who? - I mean I've been obsessed by the Beatles for the whole of my life. That's the real inspiration. But then, of course, the inspiration that the Beatles gave me was that a lot of their stuff was about love. (07:08) We got permission, fabulously, to use, I think, 18 Beatles' songs, and they didn't say which. It was a wonderful thing to write, because I'd be typing along and think, okay, he's having a crisis. And then I'd go through the Beatles catalog and think, well, \\"Help\\" is clearly, if he's gonna sing any song now, it should be \\"Help. (07:26) \\" It was a wonderful thing 'cause they've got such a range that, as I told this tale, there was always a perfect Beatles' song to go in. I think that the curve of my career is to realize that love doesn't end at the first kiss or as you walk down the aisle in wedding. That's where some of my movies did end. (07:46) When I went to \\"Love Actually,\\" which had brothers and sisters, and fathers and sons, and married couples. And then, \\"About Time\\" was a romantic comedy for half of it and then a film about death and family and marriage. And that \\"Yesterday\\" is a movie about love of music and love. (08:03) I think I've learned that love's a big subject that the traditional shape of a rom-com doesn't quite cover.” Video: \\"When I write about love I'm accused of being untrue\\" | Richard Curtis |

philanthropy and I'm so pleased to be here with Richard today so Richard I was gonna wear those shoes for you yeah I'm sorry I didn't well I'm not sure where to go with that but so Richard as we saw from the introduction you are known in your creative world in for capturing in one scenes sort of the whole zeitgeist er essence of a film as we saw with I'm just a girl so translating that over to your work with the global goals how would you what's that scene how would you translate for this audience the 15 year Odyssey that's been the global goals Richard Curtis: I think we would have to by the way it's very good to be here and I do get sort of nervous thinking about the potential that you all have changing the world in many ways so it's a great pleasure - real pleasure to be here I think when you're thinking about these goals which are a plan from 2015 to 2030 the the sequel as it were to the MDGs I think you're talking you talking in (01:20) terms of sort of massive endless Netflix series so as it were think of the sustainable development goals as the game of Thrones there are some there are some there are some baddies who will you know get elected and then over the time people who you don't think are gonna be very powerful and strong will grow to huge strength and take on power and new alliances will be forged I mean it's a decade of delivery that we're now looking for it's 11 years so I think it's not one line it's like every (02:00) person in a room like this thinking well where does my particular power lie outside just the work that I do in order to try and sort of change up the world then a very interesting fact the other day that just about the importance of a sort of interrelationship between business and and the goals that someone said to me that if temperature were to rise by 4% the insurance industry would cease existing there could be no more insurance because they're all insurance companies would go bankrupt with the extent that they had to pay back things (02:38) so the interrelationship between climate and business and sustainability is so crucial Interviewer: well the idea behind the goals are so brilliant right it's it's hey let's do this together let's set our ambition our strategy our objectives as a global human family and they're ambitious around poverty and climate change and health but they can also feel overwhelming and challenging and a bit hopeless sometimes so how do you stay optimistic as you as you're thinking about rallying the world rallying all of (03:14) us to take on these these goals Richard Curtis: well I don't I mean I don't know how much all of you know about the goals they were negotiated in after a loan negotiation by a hundred and ninety three countries there are seventeen of them I think they break down into 169 targets and the idea behind them was to be comprehensive you know I think that one of the things that is sometimes hard for all of us is you say well I'm gonna really commit to this issue you know I'm gonna support Amnesty International or I'm going to worry (03:47) about plastic in the oceans and everything you think well while I'm committing to that one should I be committing to other things and to you know is is am I in conflict with people who believe those when we did the Make Poverty History campaign which led to Live Aid there was an extraordinary moment when climate stormed out of the room I remember he was wearing shorts and carrying a bicycle and we just decided it was too complicated a mixture of things to deal with and the point about these goals is they really do say (04:20) that everything is interdependent and that actually extreme poverty is a massive Vishu in terms of climate and that injustice will also lead to extreme poverty so that all of those things are tied together so I think the idea really is that it does give it's really useful to have a big plan I mean all of you run companies you have a very very complex agenda towards absolutely everything that you do you're used to complexity and the idea that you could solve the problems of the world by sort of three simple nice phrases would be ridiculous (04:54) so the goals do actually give you an opportunity to put everything next to everything so that you actually can align the policies of a government or the policies of a business next to it and see really how you're doing and I think that makes us feel very safe and very you know United Interviewer: but do you ever do you ever feel that the challenges are just you know too far away and that we're not making the kind of progress that we should as a globe or do you see hope and some of the indicators that we're seeing at this point where we're (05:28) going Richard Curtis: yeah I'm naturally an optimist and I mean there are clearly a lot of very dark things in the world but that that speech you just saw President Obama say you know he said if there was one moment in the history of the world in which you would be best to be born that moment is now I saw an astonishing graphic of mortality in African countries between 1950 and 1920 20 the other day which was you know all in lines and they just went to just getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and you do see (06:12) extraordinary I mean you just have to look out for things to be optimistic about when I write my romantic films I'm sometimes accused of being sentimental and and untrue and I don't understand that at all so if someone someone makes a film about a serial killer they've only ever been four of them and it's called a you know searingly realistic portrait the problems facing modern society and I write a film about love and probably at least 60% of you are in love with someone at the moment and there are 7 (06:50) million people in love in London then for some reason it's called sentimental and unrealistic and untrue and I think that it just depends which way you know which way you look and my experience when I started comic relief you know I was depending on comedians many of the least nice people in the world and certainly were those selfish and I was saying to them will you do what you can for charity and we've raised whatever it is 1. (07:20) 3 billion and and and the what's happening in terms of diseases is extraordinary and I remember I wrote a film about malaria and I had a very angry phone call from the director of it saying and it took a while to make an effort and he said you haven't even checked your facts he said you know there's only 250,000 children died of malaria this year not as I had in the script five hundred thousand and it was because in the four years since I'd originally written it the number had gone down so dramatically I said to you by the way this is good news I said no (07:53) if I'm about 5 million accurate writing that's good news but I do look around me and I think that I mean you must all feel that there is power and technology to do bad but astonishing power and technology to do good there's you know terrible worries about climate change but an astonishingly empowered younger generation that has suddenly started to get the message it tremendous questions of you know inequality in terms but you know particularly of men and women but you know we are also the me two (08:28) generation things ignite things change so I think you have to sign off and say you know cynics knows days never made any money yet not a single dollar and I think that if you're optimistic and if you view the things that are working and I think then the goals provides a plan for that there is no reason not to think that you can't change the world magnificently Interviewer: well you have been obviously so successful in getting your films out globally people know and love them everywhere as you think about this part of your life where you're trying to get (09:04) the world the globe to know about and think about and care about the global close how do you think you know what's the best way to do that how do you inspire people to to be involved and reach people Richard Curtis: well I mean I've taken rather a sort of when you make films the people you hate most of the people you make the posters from the trailers particularly the posters and ghastly retouched photograph poster makers probably probably not even with your stars actual bottom probably somebody else's bottom of the photograph and then (09:43) and then you know a line you didn't write so this whole thing that you've made that you've put so much effort into well I'm the poster guy for the goals I'm trying to make them we came up with this graphic we're trying to make them simple we argued about you know trying to keep the names of them short and I'm just trying to get the word out there because what you want is that when people you know go to their employees and say let's do something about the goals you want them to have just glimpse (10:12) them come across them in some way when you make a film there's a big tradition now of you know trying to sort of get some shot of the making of the film into the newspapers so that when people see the poster it's the second time they've heard about it and when they see the trailer it's the third time and then they may be tempted to go to see the film so what we're trying to do is to spread the word in as many ways as we can through pop music through concerts through graphics through this thing we (10:41) could do called the world's largest lessons through partnership through businesses you know to try and get the idea of them out there so that when people actually you know in companies and in politics focus on them they believe that it's something that the public will endorse and possibly feel passionate about Interviewer: And one of the things that we've chatted about backstage is just you know the role of Technology so how are you seeing technology advancing and being able to help us to get get to these goals Richard Curtis: I think you probably I mean I (11:17) think that you know there's an enormous amount that technology can do I mean well I'm really you know you do look for technology just have some of the you know actual answers but certainly we have never been in a world where there's more possibility for a message going virally and hugely and then once you get that message as it were being able to press on the button of each of these and see what are the things that you can do because by the way I'm a huge believer that we can do things individually in (11:51) our lives and I think that is a very good way of as it were starting with meatless Monday and giving Tuesday and change your pension scheme Wednesday and what but no but tell me Jacqueline what's your sense about what Google could do and what technology can do for the goals because that's the world in which as it were my kids are living and most people are referring to that for their information in their… Interviewer: well you know I think like you were saying we've we've seen great progress and in some ways you know we've we've have (12:26) child poverty and great advances in health but the rest of the gap is really gonna take new solutions and I think that's where technology especially AI can be really helpful we just you know at Google we've been trying to think about how can we inspire the world especially young technologists people who are researching nonprofits social businesses to align their work with with the global goals and so one of the things that we did is we we actually launched a competition this last year an open call where we put out 25 million (13:00) dollars in a pool of funding and then expertise from our AI professionals and then said okay right tell us your idea align it with the global goals tell us how you're going to use AI and the winners which we just you know they're doing incredible work for example a team in Africa in Uganda is using really low-cost sensors that they're putting on the backs of motorcycle taxis and they're using that to map and track air pollution which is one of the silent killers and then using that to measure what's being effective (13:35) in fighting that air pollution a team in India for example is using AI to help diagnose what the the pests and the diseases are that subsistence farmers are facing and then put the right pesticide against that and that's gonna help not only the farmers to earn more income but it's going to help reduce pesticide use which is gonna help the environment that's also frontiere was one of our winners here in europe and they're doing amazing work on antibiotic resistance so they have a smartphone app (14:04) that an untrained community worker in the field could use in a low resource environment to read whether the bacteria that someone has is resistant that way they're gonna do better health for the individual but they're also going to help the globe with this kind of resistance so there's all sorts of ideas many of them being led out at the global South on how we can apply AI so we we are just trying to think about how can we seed and support inspire those kinds of technologies so we also published (14:38) some research on our site you know a lot of people think AI is just sort of magic pixie dust and don'tyou know they know it's super powerful and has so many opportunities but don't know exactly how that could apply to their cause the issue that they care about so we published some research on our site a eyes for social impact people and you can see there how what are all the AI technologies that are showing the most promise for each of the global goals so I think this kind of building the ecosystem and and building up partners (15:09) who are working on this issue is is the way that we're gonna get technology to help us accelerate and close that gap Richard Curtis: well that’s so exciting to me I do think that this idea that we may have a generation now and I hope it applies to everyone here that thinks what is my work for if it's not for tried to make the world better I believe that they be making this up Paul Palmer told me that they they did two ads for the same job at Unilever and they tested one which stressed what Unilever does for the world and it's sort of sustainable commitments and (15:48) the other one that stretched the perks and the wages and many many more people applied through the ad on the sustainability and what they do and I think the idea that you can point a generation in the direction of thinking that it's a both/and you don't need to say well I'm either gonna make a lot of money and sell my patent for millions or I'm gonna change the world you can make yes okay yes it changes the world and then you can also make a lot of money Interviewer: Well I think you're right that many (16:18) people are motivated and many people just want to know what can I do so what would you say Richard to this audience if they want to get behind the global goals and help with the work that you're doing Richard Curtis: Well I mean I think there there is an enormous number of things that you can do one just in your own lives as I was saying think about the things which could make a difference I'm really finding that helpful I will now buy an electric car because I just think that it's important to know that in the (16:48) texture of your own lives you're actually doing the things that you're meant to do because that's what you know and then inspires you textually I think that it is really it would be brilliant to communicate something about the goals to your employees because I do think this is a sort of bounce thing the moment that you say to the people who work for you we're interested in these things have a look at them check them out yourselves and then as it were counter check with us I think that you will find an amazingly interesting (17:21) dialogue between you on all the areas of your behavior on your supply chains on you know gender equality on how you're affecting the environment I think that would be an amazingly helpful dialogue check your pension fund I think this is a really interesting idea you know someone said to me the other day they're like a third of the world's money's owned by governments a third of it's owned by rich people and a third of it's owned by us as it were you know we the way that we're gonna get (17:50) more investment in all the extraordinary projects like the ones that you're describing is by pension funds and investment investing increasingly and sustainability and an impact and in those things that will change the world and I would love the feeling that when you start to talk to your employees they will say well how's our pension fund invested where's our money going and that will increasingly go into all the best projects that they can do and that some of those projects will of course be things that you yourselves are working (18:20) on now so I think it's just to introduce it into the environment of the place that you work and then really check out whether or not the things that you do are in accordance with it it'll be helpful if it hadn't been for the ten commandments I would have been committing adultery and murdering people every day of the week but I was definitely so so I just think that it's a really useful purpose and plan and if you don't know them this is the time by the way because in 2005 when we did the (18:57) Make Poverty History campaign Live Aid I couldn't the meetings with people in business were so ghastly they really just thought this is a bunch of dangerous lefties who want to give away all their money and now business as you know as there were you talking about the things that you're backing they're actually ahead they're the ones you've seen that there's a whatever business from betterworld said twelve trillion advantage in actually working for an investing of the goals people can (19:26) see that that's the way that business should go so this is exactly the moment and if we can create a dialogue between business and government because governments much prefer talking to businesses than they do talking to charities they hate charity people they always just go on repeating themselves but if you can start a dialogue 2020 is the moment to kind of start the second phase of the and so anything that any of you can do and what to have a conversation without some project everyone you know would be (19:55) dreaming.” Video: Richard Curtis | Wiki4All – YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5gMq1nmjBE

Video: \\"Richard Curtis And His Very Limited Experience Of Life\\" - Notting Hill Screenwriter Criticised - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQnQC8vGdo Transcript: (00:00) well comedian Ria Lena joins us in the studio now Ria what do you reckon um do you reckon that that the Richard Curtis should be regretting these jokes that he's made in the past or do do you think he's learned his lesson do you know I think it is about whether he should or he shouldn't I think it's the fact that he is he is looking back and he is seeing in his old work through current eyes and I think there's a lot of people that agree with him are they looking at their work through current eyes um and (00:27) regretting what they did is there not just an acknowledgement that really the world's changed I mean this is a really inter my gosh that is the most leftwing question you've ever asked I've been watch for a while I'm being serious I know the world's changed but you can't apologize for everything listen to this this is interesting Tina we've got loads of respon to this section there was no one more loved or more relevant than Robin Williams nothing was off limits he was comedic genius that's why we loved (00:51) him he must be turning in his grave to see what's happening to Comedy now because they look back the whole time I think it's a very relevant point I and I'm trying to think of of something that Robin Williams said that that in any way was was offensive he did Cover a wide range of topics he wore a fat suit for Mrs dfire was that disrespectful no that was Mrs Doubtfire he was pretending to be a Scottish nanny I don't are we implying that all Scottish nannies are we didn't have enough time in this (01:17) segment to discuss Mrs delire what a film in itself uh but well the thing is is that if you want to be successful you're going to want to make most of the people laugh most of the time all right nobody's really said that anything's per se of limits but it might limit who's going to enjoy your artwork so Ava Santina and I were talking about this earlier in our pay-per review uh the fat jokes that he would make about Bridget Jones uh and about Marty McCutchen's character in Love Actually where car (01:46) another character called her the chubby one which she wasn't at all we were led to believe at me as a young girl that Bridget Jones was overweight or even fat and I look at her now with Modern Eyes and go she hardly had on it no but I think a film but part of that part of that was the fact that the actress are suffer El wagger it was a whole publicity compan how much weight she had to put on for it because they didn't even cast somebody you know that that would fit that would fit that role I think the Bridget Jones thing is (02:19) interesting I don't think that I mean yes there were a lot of fat jokes but what I think that was if you look at the original Helen Fielding books you know he didn't completely rewrite the books this was a character that was sad to be single she was obsessed about her weight uh I think the issue was is that it was it was screen written by a straight white male instead of perhaps a woman that could understand exactly what Helen Fielding was getting at with that character and then just portray that the (02:43) way that we women would understand give you Steven both of you understood this it's ridiculous apologizing for a joke written 30 years ago if it was funny then in my mind it's funny now I'm sick of being expected to accept that everything I've ever learned loved and laughed at is wrong it is not wrong simply a reflection of my life and time no I'm sorry about the reflection of your life and time Stephen but but he has a right to that opinion and I have a right to have an opinion on his opinion (03:07) um so when we move to the the the topic of minorities in Richard Curtis films there's no doubt you watch Notting Hill there's not a single black character in it you watch Love Actually there are very few black characters in it and that's you know London in the naughties OR Notting Hill in the '90s OR that's Richard Curtis and his very limited experience of life he said himself he went to her and then he went to Oxford and he never looked outside of that and that really is a question about who are (03:35) we allowing to write art and who are we turning to and that is you know brings us on to the diversity question I know a lot of people going why do we have so much diversity so that we can have a wider range of authentic artwork put in front of us comedy or otherwise in terms of what's on or off limits I mean we we cover all things in drama all things are covered what what why you're you're she got a lovely Tour on rear Awakening I get that to 2023

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4XaYbQlKxI Transcript: Richard Curtis: (00:04) hello my name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and this is apparently my career in four minutes [extract from a movie] my dear son this is going to sound strange but there's this secret but the men in this family can travel in time Richard Curtis: Wow I mean I think of anything the secret of my films has been alive still tried to keep writing sketches and many of them if you look at “Four Weddings” it's it's in a funny way sketch movie really this these two jokes of this wedding these two jokes of the next wedding and if you look at “Notting Hill” (00:36) those seen when in the junket where is being interviewed that's like a sketch about somebody misunderstanding a film or not have you seen a film so I think they're sketch writing definitely informed and was crucial to the movie career I think the magic of sitcom is probably still writing sketches in sitcom but the plot structure of sitcom which is so crucial I don't think resembles the structure of movies very much so I think this it's harder to see the line between the sitcoms and the films. “The Tall Guy” was a very happy (01:07) film Jeff gobble a very funny man and I particularly remember just roaring with laughter in a scene where Rowan was having a party when he'd sacked Jeff go from and he for the party just bought a mini bottle of champagne because at the end of my tour with Roman we did 72 dates and Roland had a party and he bought one bottle of champagne and one pizza not one pizza for all of us one pizza so I remember having a very good time on that the successful forwards and femur was a complete surprise to everybody I got a piece of paper from (01:43) MGM or whoever owned the movie and Paula Graham who at the movie and next to America of the expected earnings that said naught so it was a great shock to everybody the strange thing was I remember thinking of the plot of Notting Hill on a very wet afternoon sitting in a waiting room with corin redgrave who played and in the dalles husband and James fleet on for wedding so I actually thought of knotting here while we were making for wedding so it was lucky for me that that coming out of the success of for weddings I already knew what I (02:19) was going to do rather than thinking oh god what's next the thing about Love Actually is it was a curious film because everybody was only on it for a week or for two weeks so that nobody could see quite how bad I was about it because just when they were thinking of my god really doesn't know what he's doing they were off so it was it was it was it was nerve-racking but it was like I could start 12 times you know every time we've got a new bunch I would be a little bit better one of the reasons I (02:46) wrote that film was because there's a whole chunk of it was particularly the Robert Altman ones but I love Nashville as a movie called smooth and I love they loved pulp fiction so there were a lot of a multi-storey for shortcuts it was a genre i love the strange thing about the cast of the boat rocked as they were almost all in every single scene so that was when i started directing just with the camera on people's shoulders so that instead of saying a single of him a secured him a single of helena chemicals (03:16) go like that and find whoever was talking I think what I learned was the sort of negative lesson which is that I didn't like the formal structures moving making I did not like doing the wide shot followed by a two-shot follow back because he just get locked in at the beginning of the day into one performance and one geography so I think that I in this in the boat the rod and now in about time the cameras very fluid and flexible and just waiting to catch good things rather you know being part of a verse of a (03:43) formal shooting straight working with earl morris with students berber was absolute joy because steven is a sultan it really is storytelling genius so you would come up with a scene and he would say what that sounds great how about this and suddenly he would imagine 10 minutes of cinema that you can completely see if you said well I'm not sure that's right because this character wouldn't do that he'd imagined another whole 10 minutes of cinema I mean he was fantastic like someone who could go on (04:09) writing brilliant Tunes one after anot her well it's funny I have already written to time travel thing said there was time traveling in a black and a special that we do and I did a doctor who which was fun time traveling back to him Vincent van Gogh so I obviously am interested in it I didn't research time travel movies before I made my wanted to go back and watch I mean at the moment I'm not intending to direct something again the moment the message of about time is just do stress do less stressful (04:40) things and enjoy yourself and so the next time i work with bill will be working on a walking holiday rather than a movie.” Video: Richard Curtis and His Start with Four Weddings and a Funeral - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YutcjLfHVRI Transcript: (00:04) Interviewer: the film that we first got to know you with As Americans uh was “Four Weddings and a funeral” was it the first film you wrote Richard Curtis: second I wrote a film called “The Tall Guy” which was Emma Thompson's Emma Thompson and Jeff Goldblum MH that that smatter is an exact proportional representation um of how much money that movie made in comparison to Four Weddings Interviewer: okay so “four weddings and a funeral” um introdu gave us Hugh Grant in America that's sort of what all sold us on Hugh Grant um would you like to apologize to anyone right now Richard Curtis: (00:39) the answer the official answer is only to Divine Brown isn't it that's the that's the official answer to the question but no no I mean I didn't I tried not to allow Hugh to audition because I thought he was too handsome and I thought it would… Interviewer: he wasn't he wasn't you didn't think he was right for that part Richard Curtis: no no and in fact in the end were me the director and the producer and it came down to choosing between Hugh and Alan Rickman and I voted for Alan wow so I I I was so wrong um but would have been a very (01:14) different part yeah and the thing is I'd imagined it like breaking away in a film called Gregory's girl a very great English movie where uh I thought that that the the guy had to be not attractive particularly that had to be the explanation and then he found true love I didn't realize that by making him attractive it would make the film sort of three times as successful but Hugh was uh Hugh was the only but Hugh was the only person who could do the lines of all the 70 people we auditioned and he was extraordinarily on point he was (01:47) completely accurate he he did everything as exactly as I'd dreamt it I was I was very lucky.” Video: ‘Love Actually’ writer Richard Curtis on film’s legacy - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNspva0W3xY Transcript: Interviewer: (00:00) 20 years Richard Curtis: yeah I know I think the 20 years shows what a youthful optimist I probably was when I wrote it Interviewer: he says he still wants to write about our Humanity the surprising ways we are good to each other in a world that has so many movies filled with trauma and violence Richard Curtis: we get thousands of films about serial killers and there's only ever been about nine of them and yeah there'll be a million people falling in love feeling it's the most interesting moment of their lives Good Deeds inside families and Good Deeds inside (00:38) communities if you look at what happened during covid and the extraordinary sort of bravery and heroism I do think the way to think about life is that every day has the potential in all its Simplicity just to be just to be gorgeous.” Video: (1) Richard Curtis explains why he likes to set his films in Britain - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvBZnc_Wbg Transcript: (00:03) and I wrote the script and it was set in Boston and I went to see the people at MGM and they said this is amazing this is a fantastic script I said oh I'm so thrilled and they said except the two leading characters we don't like I said why and they said well it's sort of weak no one's gonna admire them we'll want to spend time with them I said no and they said the dialogues very English it doesn't really read American so you'll have to work on that and I said oh right and then they said which means that most (00:38) of the jokes don't work because people won't get their humor so I said that only needs the title that's the only thing we've got and they said we hate the time and I I flew home two weeks later and I swore I'll never do a film that's not set actually where I live.

Person 5: all his work is as seamless thing that the Vicar of Dibley and Blackadder and Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a (01:00) funeral and comic relief and Love Actually and Make Poverty History are all part of who he is as a man and also as this incredibly talented writer and creative artist Person 6: well he's an enigma and rather like the character of Charles and Four Weddings when I was sent that script I never really understood the character because I thought no one in England is both funny and nice you know you can't or not the sort of a servic and nice but Richard does bring off that strange balancing act Person 7: no I think what he he's a master of is the apparent (01:35) inability of people to communicate certainly that was true of the character I played in Love Actually and I think it's very true of the character that Hugh Grant plays in Notting Hill Person 1: Richard’s funniest lines are undoubtedly Hugh Grant's lines which are always ““t…th…er…d…um..t..th…s..er…” Person 7: what's actually happening is that he's expressing something very very precisely in this apparent breakdown of language in this district Person 1: ““t…th…er…d…um..t..th…s..er…” I love those Person 2: the trademarks I suppose of a Richard Curtis script apart from the fact that it will always be intelligent clever and (02:28) purposeful is the fact that every minute and a half or so he'll deliver a world-class joke Person 5: the thing that marks our Richards work from it everyone else's is that it's a seamless part of who he is as a person and so that he didn't write Love Actually in order to make a crowd-pleasing film he wrote it because that's his philosophy of life Person 6: basically yeah I'm afraid to say he actually does quite like people you know he's the exact that's what makes it makes me laugh that I play these (03:00) characters which are basically him in his films because he is basically nice and full of benevolence and I am basically nasty and full of hatred Person 7: if one is right in thinking that Richards view of the world is very focused on love as a force in common with all humanity and love and all its difficulties in that it's the thing that somehow drives us all which is the thesis of Love Actually I think that does lie at the root of his work for Africa Person 8: I mean we all saw the Michael Burke films from that came out of (03:35) Ethiopia but instigated live oh but we should actually went on his own money to go and look and to see what he could do to help Person 9: he invented Red Nose Day I mean it's not given to many people who invent a day there's a man Jesus I'm not sure how many others I can name Person 3: the Red Nosed they affect is extraordinary the level of knowledge about issues around poverty is so high in Britain compared to the rest of Europe or America Person 8: is immensely generous with his time you know when it's a comic relief here he'll give up (04:05) six months of his life sometimes twelve eighteen months to make sure something will happen properly Person 4: couple of years before the Gleneagles g8 summit we were in desperate need of the best storyteller we could find to communicate these rather dull issues of debt and trade to the British public so he asked Richard to take a year off and make poverty history Person 7: looking back at the Live 8 (concerts) I think it's quite remarkable that his efforts together with Bob Geldof got people talking in a way that had never happened before never would (04:39) have been possible Person 2: “The Girl In the Café” was a great opportunity for me and it was something that I'm extremely proud to have been associated with it's a perfect amount of of entertainment and information and it made a big impact all over the world particularly in America where it was extremely well received Person 3: his work with Comic Relief and Make Poverty History is responsible for saving the lives literally countless mothers daughters fathers and sons across the world Person 7: when looking at what he's achieved I think (05:14) it's very very important to remember that he is also very largely responsible for Hugh Grant and I think that has to be taken into consideration when looking at the good side of Richard Person 4: Richard congratulations mate you're an absolute national treasure Person 1: I think it's very important that Richard Curtis should own this fellowship because otherwise how will he return the ring to Mordor Video: Richard Curtis, What's Funny? | MontclairFilm – YouTube https://youtu.be/-UqyVPGVM_8?list=LL Transcript: Interviewer: I understand, and tell me if I got this right, is that when you first started writing a wrote for the BBC, and that you were given a list of things that were funny. Richard Curtis: Yes, that's absolutely right, yeah. Interviewer: Okay, that's a difference between American comedy and British comedy. No one gives us a list of things that were funny when we started writing job. What was this list? The government had officially determined. Richard Curtis: No. I didn't like that list, but they were, and they were in a funny way, summed up by Cambridge, an Oxford when I was there. Cambridge had a real sort of system. You've probably heard of the Cambridge Footlights, and you kind of auditioned for it. They had a show up in Edinburgh. So they'd almost sort of math and math-ish-sized comedy. Time you saw a sketch of theirs. You thought, oh, that's very highly wrought and very clever, but there was very little humanity in it. And actually, you see a lot of that in Monty-Python. Not that much humanity. And that had sort of crept into the BBC. And so when you went there, they said, well, we're doing a satirical program, and the funny things are trade unions, British rail sandwiches. You know, the chancellor's eyebrows. And I thought the funny things were someone who's a bit uneasy with the person sending next door to them, because they're taller than they are. Do I mean, everything I thought was funny, was to do with human beings interacting, and nothing to do with politics and preconceptions. So that was the reason I failed failed so badly on weak ending the satirical radiation.

Richard Curtis: nobody knows I don't even I don't know I can't remember I can't remember how it's done that's the strange thing is it is a sort of organic organic process so one of the things is to make sure that you really do believe in the story that it keeps coming back to you so that as it (00:35) were there's a purpose to it I then I mean I used to be the most ill-disciplined writer I would get up at one watch some television have some tea make some phone calls have some dinner big oh I should probably start now but since I've had kids and a family I actually do try and go to a quiet place and write a lot Interviewer: have you had a favorite character? Richard Curtis: I'd I liked the stupid ones I like the stupid characters so there was baldrick and Blackadder and Emma chambers in The Vicar of Dibley and Rhys Ifans and Notting Hill it's just so nice (01:14) to have someone who gets a laugh Interviewer: and any advice for young screenwriters of today Richard? Richard Curtis: my advice is to work with people you genuinely admire I think that it can be a real mistake and this goes back to what you know we're doing here which is you find the people who are passionate and you work with them and you find the companies who are passionate the politicians who are passionate and I think sometimes young writers will make a mistake of saying well this is a famous name if that person wants to make my film that would be fantastic and (01:53) that's a famous actor and if they want to be in my film that's fantastic but if you don't like that directors work and if that actor is not the right actor for the part it will the whole thing won’t you know won't work so I think trying to keep your sense of integrity even in the face of more shiny objects Video: Exclusive Insight from Rowan Atkinson & Co-Creator & Writer, Richard Curtis | Happy Birthday Mr Bean - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt8agz7jipY Transcript: Person 1: (00:06) what was usually funny was just the process of of how he gets out of a difficult situation or how he gets into a difficult situation [Extract from Mr Bean] Charcter 1: done your revision? Bean: oh yes i've concentrated on trigonometry Character 1: i've done calculus mainly Bean: i believe they concentrated on calculus last year Character 1: oh dear Character 2: quiet ladies and gentlemen please the exam starts now [end of extraction] Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson): bodily expression particularly with mr bean is so very very important it's sort of screaming at you you know there may be no words but you're being shouted at i think very loudly by the (00:59) bodily expression the word compelling is quite good because i think that's what draws you into a lot of mr bean sketches Richard Curtis: you only have to have the starting point of the idea he gets locked out of his room or he's going to a swimming pool or something like that and then you could be pretty confident that we would be able to to make it work [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: with those who answer the green calculus papers please put them in the green box and those who answer the white trigonometry papers please put them in the white box [End of extract] Richard Curtis: what i've always done on the mr beans is (02:09) it where i've done the charcoal outline and then rowan adds all the color and the texture and i laughed at him while he's doing it [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: i said stop writing will you stop writing Narrator: it is 30 years since the first mr bean was shown on british television and it became an instant hit between 1990 and 1995 the team went on to produce 14 episodes in total Person 3 (Sir Tony Robinson): i didn't know until this moment there were only 14. (02:49) i thought there were probably 114 and that roman had been coining in for years and years making this never-ending flow of mr beans Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson) : we did the other 14 episodes in drips and drabs we didn't make 14 at once we made two and then we made three more and then we made one one and we made four more and eventually we got to this rather poultry sum of 14. (03:16) they were always given a sort of prime spot and and they keep that and suddenly you know people realize that visual comedy could actually hold a large audience Narator: after the overnight success of episode 1 the team was in need of new material and comedy writer robin driscoll was hired he would also feature in various sketches as a straight man to rowan Richard Curtis: i would say in the story of mr bean it's rowan, robin, and then possibly me i was thinking away rowan and i did the obvious ones we got the low hanging fruit and what was brilliant about robin (04:08) is that he's just kept as it were squeezing the lemon finding new things finding different ways taking a little thread be it to do with the car or with the teddy or anything like that. Video: Richard Curtis | BAFTA Screenwriters' Lecture Series - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMcXrAPmchk Transcript: Video: Richard Curtis Talks ABOUT TIME with AMC - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQJK3xXDrc Transcript: Interviewer: (00:05) so now you came up with this premise over a pretty simple conversation right about what you would do with the last 24 hours liv Richard Curtis: yeah actually i i came up with the idea that i wanted to write a film about how to be happy and about appreciating a normal day that actually your happiest day wouldn't be some exotic day in las vegas with winning a million dollars and hearing you'd be nominated for an oscar that'd be tense and nervous but uh the idea my first idea was in fact to write a really simple film about (00:35) a normal day and then i thought that'll be dull so i then thought i'll write a huge science fiction time travel movie where the person finally decides that all he would do with this gift is simply lead a normal day and travel back to the beginning of each day and just live it again and enjoy it Interviewer: and i felt like you really wrote that in bill nye's character out of all of them because you know even with this gift it kind of goes back to that simplicity of just the beauty of our everyday life Richard Curtis: right yeah that's so true and bill and I (01:06) talk about this a lot now i mean i think we're we're both saying to each other are you sticking to the moral of the movie we're trying to make sure we're holding to it because both of us feel as though we should you know be more happy just with the normal day and not worry so much Interviewer: so what i love so much about your films is that all these characters they're witty and intelligent but very very relatable i feel like we can all relate to at least one of them and the same goes with gleason and mcadams characters (01:35) their chemistry on screen was amazing what was it like watching you know these characters come alive in the two of them again with chemistry that can't be taught it's there or it's not Richard Curtis: no it's so interesting i'm not i i until my films are well cast they're no good at all it would you would be interested how in the casting sessions i just lose confidence with every single person who comes in and it's only when you actually get the perfect person like as there were love in life suddenly when donald came in for the (02:04) first time the part was funny and i think that you tend to cast people who kind of appeal to your heart and then once you've done that they are likely to have some chemistry they are likely to get on with each other you know i could tell that both donal and rachel were basically sweet people with a naughty twinkle and i think that's why they got on so well Interviewer: i like that naughty twinkle so out of all the amazing characters that you have created and there are so many of them who do you think from a past film would (02:35) have been a good addition in this film Richard Curtis: oh what an interesting question um i don't know if you i mean that's an interesting question because spike you remember who Hugh lived with in notting hill if you see course very bad he wouldn't have fitted into this movie at all but there was a character in “four weddings” a very sweet character played by james fleet who was the not very clever posh rich friend yeah i can imagine him fitting into this movie and then Bill's character in love actually could just have been on the (03:06) telly because i think it's ten years since the movie came out and i'm sure he would be re-releasing the movie the dodgy song for christmas to try and make a few extra Interview: i think you should throw him in every movie that character the rock star Richard Curtis: on the radio Interviewer: yes so why do you think amc theater audiences and audiences everywhere are going to love this movie Richard Curtis: i hope that they will get slightly more than they bargained for i mean i it is quite a romantic film but i hope there are lots of jokes in it there actually (03:34) is some time travel and some of the normal chaos that time travel chooses and then i think in the end the movie turns out to be a little bit more emotional than expected i've known a lot of people who say that the moment they walked out they rang their dad or ran their son so i hope it'll be a movie that actually leaves something in your mind when you've seen. Video: Richard Curtis Interview: Love, Actually, Genie, Notting Hill, and Pirate Radio | Collider Interviews – YouTube https://youtu.be/8DSE5a0Xvyc Transcript: When I spoke to you for yesterday, you told me you had a five-hour cut of Pirate Radio. My question is, when can I see it? You can never see it. No one will ever see it. But it's a funny thing with Pirate Radio. Now I think about it, I think if I'd written it now, I would have done it as a TV series. Actually, it was very kind of episodic, and we should have done one where they raid another boat, one where they start to drown, one where the electricity goes down. But it was fun at five hours, but I don't think for human consumption. Well, you never know. I mean, Baz just released his Australia cut on Hulu as a miniseries. So maybe you want to revisit that as a... Anyway, that's just a hypothetical. So I read a few years ago that Hugh Grant revealed Notting Hill was maybe based on a friend of yours. And I wanted to know if it's possibly time for the truth to come out. No. I wouldn't go to Hugh Grant for the truth, if you're searching for it. It was really based on a kind of fantasy I used to have. I used to go for dinner every week with the same people and have the same conversation. And I remember when I was an obsessive Madonna fan, I thought... what would it be like if at last I managed to walk in with with a woman instead of just on my own with a warm bottle of white wine and kind of so the movie started with that kind of dream scenario of what would it be like if you could and you know I was thinking about Madonna and one of my friends at that dinner was an obsessive Madonna fan and the other one would definitely never have heard of her so it was based on a on a dream rather than on a on a fact. So it's the 20th anniversary of Love Actually and it's now become a Christmas classic you know people love the movie I love the movie and if it comes on it means I have to keep watching. When did you realize wait a minute this film has become something special to a lot of people? It was it was when I started getting texts from people I didn't know very well saying we're watching it again you know it was it did take a while and it's still a bit of a mystery to me I mean I've got a theory I think the reason people watch it again is they can never remember what's going to happen next you know normally when you watch a movie you know they've robbed the bank they're going to get in the car drive away and then they're going to get shot by the police whereas even I when I watch Love Actually don't have any idea what the next scene is so I think it kind of it's bearable to watch it again because it's always surprising you but you know it's a once in a lifetime bit of luck when you make something particularly Christmas. I used to so love watching Charlie Brown's Christmas every Christmas and White Christmas every Christmas. So I'm, it's a real little, it's a real little boost for me. Did you ever think the Andrew Lincoln storyline might be a little too weird? I am very often told it's a little too weird. It didn't occur to me at the time, but you know times change. And I remember someone once saying they would like to interview me about it and they would be focusing on the stalking scene. And I said, \\"Oh, I didn't know there was a stalking scene.\\" And they said, \\"Yeah, yeah, no, you know, the Andrew Lincoln, that's like top notch stalking.\\" So, you know, slowly but surely I've realized what a dreadful mistake I made. I don't think it's a mistake as much as, you know, it's a little different than the rest. But anyway, there's a new 4K release that's about to come out. What are you actually most excited for people to see on it? Well, it is very pretty now. I mean, it is interesting. You know, one of the things I do like about Love Actually is I love how kind of it looks. I think actually the kind of texture of it is very, has a sort of magic to it. And we've really added to that. The 4K, you know, where there were fuzzes in the background, you can see chandeliers and candles and everything like that. So I think it's just a sort of general feeling that the movie somehow got. a little bit better, that it's even more cheerful than it was before. That, so the grade is really lovely and then we've also remixed it and that's fun as well because, you know, technical things do improve as time goes by. If you can imagine watching a brighter version of White Christmas, what joy that would be. You've directed, you've written a lot, but you've only directed a few things. Do you have plans for directing something else or you, no? No, I found directing quite tricky. And I mean, this movie is a great example. I wrote a movie set in New York, which is such a pleasure for me, but I would have felt really insecure as a non-American directing it. And also, you know, I'm getting old and Sam Boyd who directed it is not only an American, but young. So I think I'll always find someone who's better than me now. I don't necessarily better than you, I'd just say different than you. Also, I'm trying to keep my weight down. And when you direct movies, you have to eat a certain number of donuts and bacon sandwiches. And I think that's, you know, that's a heavy price to pay. I don't think people realize, actually, the one thing is there's a lot of food on movie sets, not in the UK. The UK is a little stingy, but in America, forget it. Whatever they call it, that service table. It's the most dreadful temptation. Making a movie is like going to Willy Wonka. Yes. It's just sweets everywhere. Unless you're in the UK. I've done UK set visits and you're lucky to get a cup of tea. No, it's true. American movies are better. Just on craft service. On craft service. Right, exactly. So a lot of people with Genie will not realize this is a remake of something you made many years ago. And so I'm just curious, how did it come about to remake this? Well, it's funny. Not long after I made the original movie, which is only an hour long, I thought this would have been fun as a movie movie. But time goes by, you have children and all that kind of stuff. And then just a couple of years ago, I thought I will go back and look. And my circumstances, that's about kind of a sad singleton who's just lost his girlfriend. And I thought, well, I'd love to make a movie about families on Christmas. And I can actually write a really different movie. I can set it in America. We can have a female Genie. And then, you know, the dream came true and we got Melissa. So there was just enough, you know, a lot of extra things. And then I do love Christmas movies. And if I can, you know, do another one, that makes me happy. One of the things about a film where you have a Genie and they can wish for anything is it can get expensive very fast. So how much in the writing of this, of the remake, are you thinking we can't afford that? So let me not even write it. you know, what normally happens is you write a movie and then people tell you, you can't afford it. So I don't remember thinking, I've got to, I can't do this or that. And then I think there were moments of realism, you know, we couldn't get a real cap. But I think that on the whole, my imagination is pretty modest. So most of it happens, you know, in a pretty realistic environment. And then once in a while they say, you know, change a, you know, Christmas market to, you know, a coffee stall. Sure. You have a number of references to Tom Cruise in the film. And I'm curious, did you need permission when she's wearing that shirt? Like how did that all come about? We did need permission from Tom. It was so sweet that he gave it, you know, because there's an element of teasing. I once worked, tried to do a film with Tom and he was always so delightful and friendly to me. And I don't know whether the reason he said yes is because, you know, he was so chummy then. But I love the fact that I have eventually written a Tom Cruise movie. Just so happens Tom's not in it. Exactly. But he's on the t-shirt. He's on the t-shirt and we've got like a three second clip from Mission Impossible. Yeah. When I saw that, I was like, oh, wow. I mean, you need permission for this. This is a, you know what I mean? So one of the things about this is that it's more of a family film. And I'm curious, how did the balance of that come about in terms of how much, no, actually, let me skip that question altogether. I'm fascinated by the editing process 'cause it's where it all comes together. How did this possibly change in the editing room in ways you didn't expect? Or was this all Sam and you just saw the finished film? - No, no. I mean, editing is my favorite part of the process because it's just so interesting. You write a film, it reads really well. You shoot the film, you watch it, you think it's the worst film you've ever seen. And it's really interesting. And one of the thing, you know, how you have to take out bits, change bits, stress bits. You know, one of the great things about Melissa in this is she's both magical, but very normal. And the first time I thought it, about an hour in, I thought, \\"Oh, I've forgotten she's a genie.\\" You know, she's just a lovely woman. And then you have to build up, put scenes where she does magic closer together. And then the great thing about Christmas movies is just the wealth of wonderful Christmas songs. You know, you suddenly can, if it's getting a bit weak, you throw in the OJs or Otis Redding or a bit of Anvil and suddenly the movie perks up. So, no, just like all my movies, it was a bit of a struggle. But. Particularly because the two leads, well, I say the two leads and Mark Maron and Louise Guzman, because the cast was so strong, we had very firm foundations. But as always, it was a it was a journey. What do you think would surprise soon to be fans of Genie to learn about the making of Genie? Well, I think they shouldn't be surprised that some of the funniest lines were written by Melissa McCarthy and Mark Maron. You know, I'm quite a tyrant in terms of my own lines, but these were really clever, great American comedians. And they added, you know, they added stuff in. And I think that, you know, I think everyone will perhaps be surprised how convincingly American it is. And that's because, you know, Sam's an American director. And so I hope that it feels like a Richard Curtis movie, but in a whole new in a whole new world. I am a fan of your work, have been for a very long time. I'm obviously very curious what you are working on now. Well, I'm working on buying Christmas presents and decorating the tree. You know, that's that's the big stuff. Oh, I've got a few things. I've been working on an animation, which has been a gripping process. I mean, it's the longest filmmaking in the world. But it's really interesting because you write, direct, cast, shoot and edit all at the same time. So that's been very interesting to me. And now I think I might write a play. Really? Yeah, go on. Are you writing it now, or it's... I've had a go. I've started a couple of them, so I think that might be the next thing I do. The animated thing you're talking about is called \\"That Christmas.\\" Yes. Oh, I didn't... That's my final outing to Christmas, by the way. It is? It's all going to be Easter and Midsummer's Day from now on. Sir, you have an addiction to Christmas. I'm sure that the play takes place at Christmas. No. No. There's not going to be any Christmas. I'm going to do \\"Delete All\\" on my computer whenever Christmas is mentioned again, but I'm hoping... You know, with Jeannie, I'm trying to go out with a bang. No, I think you mean \\"That Christmas,\\" you're going to go out with a bang. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm going out with a pre-bang on Jeannie. Exactly. When actually is that coming out? Do you know? Next Christmas, because Christmas takes so long. So a year from now, we will be talking again? I hope so. And you will be talking about how the play all of a sudden went to taking place at Christmas. Yeah, the play will be \\"Christmas Carol\\" by then. Right. You have actually done a tremendous amount through your career, and I am curious, if someone has never seen anything you've done before, what do you want them watching first and why? Wow. What a... Do you know, the thing I really like... Sometimes I go online and I find that somebody who isn't me has edited... like my movies down to three minutes with a really pretty pop song. I think start with that. You know, lots of pretty people and no, you know, dodgy jokes. I'd go for Richard Curtis, the montage. Start there. I'm very... I think Four Weddings is lovely. And I wrote a TV show called Blackadder. And the final episode of the final series of that is, I think, an interesting piece of work. So there are some things I like. But start with Genie. Start with Genie. - Of course. Last question for you. Which of the films that you worked on or wrote do you think changed in the editing room? Which of the films changed the most in the editing room in ways you didn't expect going in? - Oh, that's definitely Love Actually, strangely. Because Love Actually was, you know, 10 stories and it seemed to work well. And it is in a completely different order to what we wrote it in. It's unrecognizable from the original order, even though the scenes are the same. It was like playing three-dimensional chess because you could put any scene after any scene at any point. That's definitely the one that changed most. - On that note, sir, I wish you nothing but the best. Thank you for giving me your time and good luck with the rest of your speed dating. - That's so sweet. Don't go changing and Merry Christmas. - Great. See you later from Horton Held. Video: Richard Curtis | BAFTA Screenwriters' Lecture Series | BAFTA Guru – YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMcXrAPmchk Transcript: Macaron I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, welcome to the BAFTA and BFI International Screenwriters lecture series for 2013. I was on the BAFTA film committee and discovered I was the only screenwriter who'd ever been on it. And after I got over the shock, I decided that the best I could do for my screenwriting brothers and sisters was to set up a lecture series in the name of BAFTA and we were able to bring the BFI in on that. This year we got a fantastic lineup, we start with David Eskoyer, we end with Richard Curtis and in between we have Hosseina Minis, Susanna Grant and Tony Gilroy. These are serious heavy weights from the UK and from America. You will be inspired by these individuals. We have been trying to get Richard Curtis since day one of day one. So this is a huge pleasure because I had begun to give up hope that we would ever manage to lure Richard in. If you ask someone in the street to name a famous screenwriter, they probably couldn't, but they might come up with Richard Curtis. That's how famous he is. And if you look at his filmography, you're looking at the list, not the list, the list of the best selling British films of all time. He's almost created a genre of his own and has written a mirror that holds itself up to us as British people. One of the keys to the success of the series is that we don't give up on those we love and even though they come up with very, very good excuses, we just don't accept that. So it's a particular pleasure to have Richard Curtis closing the series because tonight we have some serious heavy weight writers in the audience. And I am really looking forward to hearing what he has to say. This is almost my first lecture or the other lectures I've ever given of being to my children. And I'm still doing the washing up. So I'm not exactly convinced of the efficacy of the lecture form. And also I do also want to say that everything that I say will only be partially true or as it were only true for me, which is a really important thing. I'm screenwriters on the whole don't talk to each other about what they do. For instance, I've always think it's a clever thing to leave myself notes for the next day. So I've never woken up and started writing with an empty page in front of me. There may be other people for whom the empty pages absolutely key. Without it they couldn't as it were, feel the challenge. I write enormous amounts. I write 20, 30 pages of stuff a day and hope that some of it's good. There may be other people who do the exact opposite who care about every word and don't put it down until they're sure it's right. So I seriously don't know what's right or wrong. All I can do is tell you what's true for me. And the first bit now is going to be of the evening. I've decided to use like inspiration, Jeremy Paxman. And because I'm just going to ask myself the same question a few times and try and give a few different answers. And the question is why I'll be answering that. And then I think Edith and I have agreed that we might talk about how, as it were, about the process as a little bit more and then you can ask whatever you like. The first question that I asked myself is why did I start writing films? And the answer is because someone called Michael an American asked me to write a film. So I got a phone call from my agent saying he wants to see you tonight. And I thought of the idea for the film that I was going to sell him on the Northern line. And that was the first big mistake that I've never made again, which is that I always have lived with the idea of any film that I'm going to do for at least a year before I eventually start writing it. Films can't be in factuations. They've got to be relationships. And I suppose this is my first observation that I think the difference between having a good idea for a film and a finished film that you like is the same as seeing a pretty girl at a party and being there when you're wife delivers the third baby. It's an incredibly long journey. And a good idea is only the tiny little spark at the beginning of this immense process. I came up with the idea for Michael. It was about a father and a son who both found out on the same night that the girls they were with, the girlfriend and the wife were having sex with other people. And so they both as it were left their flat and their house and moved in together in a hotel and had to as it were deal with their peculiar situations together. And it was called four eyes and fat thighs. And I think that's the only thing I really got out of it because that's weirdly close to four weddings and a funeral. So it was the first and then I wrote a draft. I went out to L.A. and I wrote a second draft under the producers E. Goli in his guest room and then he put me together with a director with whom I wrote a third draft and then we handed it in and we had what I think is quite a typical American meeting. They loved the script. They really loved it and I asked them did they have any reservations at all because their smiles were so big and they said the dialogue wasn't great. It was to English and a bit too formal. And I said, all right, then they said that the two leading characters were not good because they were both weak and they needed someone to be able to root for in the movie. And then they said, and obviously the jokes are all very English. So we'd have to think of jokes that would appear more to an American sense of humour. And then I remember saying to them that really only leaves the title and they said we hate the title. But the strange thing was they still said, can't wait to get the next draft. So I went home. I was staying with a friend of mine by the stage because I was sorted out of the nose breakdown. I got a self-induced temperature of 103 about a week later. I flew home to England and met a girl in May as sued me in perpetuity. I never delivered the script and that explains pretty well everything about what I have done since then. First, never do a project that you haven't thought about beforehand. Be sure of that you're working with people who actually like the work you do, which I think is hugely important. Choose the people you work with really carefully. This director was a lovely man but I remember when we were talking about the film the very first day. He said, oh, I so I don't know if I would have this film. When my wife left me, I'd just went out and had sex with a different girl every night for a month. And this was a film about two men who don't have ever had sex with one person in their entire lives. So he was completely and utterly the wrong man to be making this film. But most importantly, and this isn't a rule for everyone, but it sort of is explains everything since then. I decided that I would never write a film about anything that I didn't really know about very personally. I didn't know. I realized when I was writing the film where American shopped, I didn't know what they'd watched on TV when they were kids. I didn't know anything about the structure of their schools. So I came straight home and I wrote a film called Count Townboy, which was eventually called the Torguei about someone who lived in Count Town where I lived about someone who had Heifever, which I had, and about someone who's job was to be a straight man to a comedian whose name was in the script, Ron Anderson and my job was to be Rowan's straight Rowan Act in straight Ram. So I have always since then basically stuck to what I think is true to my experience and emotionally right for me. So that's why I started on a career of small personal English films. And it was absolutely key. And I think the other thing that was key in the development of myself as a screenwriter was one sentence in William Goldman's fabulous book called Adventures in the Screen Trade, which I would recommend anyone who hasn't read to read, where he said that most directors end up making films that vaguely remind them of a screenplay that they once read. And it's that sentence is the stake of fear through my heart that's dominated everything I've done since then. The next question I've asked myself is why so many of the films or the films have generally turned out as I hoped they would. And this is quite a complicated and odd thing. And I didn't realize as it was going to be the core of what I was going to say when I was asked about, and I thought, oh well, I'll write about playing lots of pop music while I'm writing. But on the whole the films that I've worked on have turned out as I intended. And I don't know how replicable it is and I don't know if my experience is very personal. But I would say that from my point of view a huge amount of the challenge facing a screenwriter is about control. And that is a very important trickieria. When it came to four weddings, I decided I was going to take it even more seriously. We made a deal that we, me and Duncan, would be involved in every part of the process of making the film, which meant being there when it was being cast, being there every day when it was shot and being there a lot of the time when it was being edited even though not all the time. And so strangely for me in the end I decided simply in order to stay alive that I would take to directing myself, which obviously comes with pluses and minuses. I am probably the worst director that I've worked with. But at least I know what I want and and how it should be and that it will be accurate. What you've got to be very careful, I'm particularly aware of how horrible it is to have a stubborn writer in the edit and I hope that I'm more ruthless in editing my own films than anyone else could possibly be. Certainly that's been my experience. I'm always saying take out more. But I do feel that you should as a writer if you can try to be there when it's done because you don't want to waste your life making or having other people make the wrong films. And now the final bit, which is the most surprising bit to me of all and I've only it's been made seem odd to you but I only started to think about it for days ago is why I have actually written the films that I've written at all. I suddenly thought why have I written this bunch of films instead of another bunch of films? I've said here when I thought of first writing movies, these were my favorite 10 films. Godfather one, Godfather two, the Avengers of Robin Hood, Doge Day off to noon, Emmanuel one, Emmanuel two, white Christmas, closing cows of the third kind, animal house and a street kind name desire. And it never even occurred to me that I could write anything like any of those films in the same way that often you end up marrying someone who's not the slightest bit like you. But there was another bunch of films which for some reason or other I felt I could identify with and could do something like and I'm interested in why I thought that, why I didn't think I could do the other type. And the strange thing to me is that I wrote my first film when I was 30 and I really ended up the key things that I've written have been on the same subjects about they've been about love and they've been about friendship and they've been about family. And thinking about tonight I've been as puzzled as some of the people who are very critical of my films are why I would bother doing it again and again and again. And I've tried to think about this. Why have I not gone down a lot of other routes? And I've taken a bit of consolation. I've got a second slide here from thinking about artists and I'm not comparing myself with these. But I don't know if you've got sugar. There are lots of cities and lots of you know cafeterias and lots of soup cans. But every time he sat down he thought, oh I know, I'll make everything a bit blue and put some flowers in it and on the whole people it'll be jumping over houses. And then if we just go on and look at the other two, oh there we go. Must have led a life of great variety but every time he put pen to paper, these people. And then just the last one, there we go. Really? Oh, I mean, all you thought, he must have been able to see there were other ways of going about things. But for some reason or other and I do think that there is a thing about style, you know, as it were brushed to paper and pen to paper, which is the thing that you do and there's probably not much that you can do about that. And so I've just been thinking that it must be the reason I've written all these films. There's because the things that I feel most deeply must be about those subjects in my own life. So I was raised in a family that was full of love. That's what was the big thing in my youth was as it were family love. And all the big emotions and all the big things that I felt have been in this area in the area of romantic love, family love, friendship and not as it were in the area of serial killers, superheroes, people who died 300 years ago, secrets, scandals, corruption, action, sporting victories, gangsters, things from outer space. All of these things that are a few gentrists to other people and take up their time were clearly not being the thing which inspired me. I've just written a lot of times about love, friends and family because it would seem that if you really write what you care about, you as it were, have no choice. And that must be why I've really written about anything else. Maybe that takes me back to the beginning. All the mistakes I made on the first firm, I found that what I do best is when I write what is true to me, what I understand. And I hope that I have listened in more ways than one, to my own instincts and my own heart. And at least for the moment, that's my explanation why I've ended up writing the things that I have. We're off. Are you ready to really push control slightly? Yes. Good. Glad to hear that. Have you got all the clips I told you that we must have really... Thanks, so they're already with Big Red Botan up there. Yeah, we're ready, we're good. Before we get to the clips, we've got to start with the question on how, how you approach writing a screenplay. I mean, just very quickly on that. I've been trying to think, how do I write a screenplay? Because I certainly don't sit down in a month or two months. I think the answer is, I think of an idea ages before. And then I kind of write a long, weird, prose poem to myself with lots of bits of dialogue in it, which is just a discussion. So I say, this might happen in the middle of these, might be the characters. This might be the end. This might be the beginning. I mean, I would never write a treatment, by the way. I think they are... shockingly bad idea. I genuinely think that a treatment is the equivalent of a prose description of a painting. I think I will draw a picture of a pretty woman with a landscape behind her and you're not quite sure whether she's smiling or sad. That's the Mona Lisa. But I genuinely think they're nonsense. So I would have never done that if I can. And then slowly, I kind of, I then I think I'd write down on cards, incidents that are in it and see whether or not, suddenly I've got 100 things that start to be in an order that's vaguely sensible. And then I will start having a go at writing. I find it really fascinating when you were talking in your lecture about how involved you are. I mean, is that quite a unique thing for a writer who's not the director of a film to be that involved through that whole process? I think it is, but we've made it work and it's been complicated. I mean, I think I really do think of my job as a screenwriter being pretty well equal. And I mean, actually, obviously, if you'll then direct in the movie, that bit's equal. My contribution to the directing of the movie was not as important, I think it's very important to be there. But I think the editing of films, again, it really is a massive rewrite. And it is a extraordinarily important part of the process. And I can't, if I could take you guys through time to see how disastrous at least four of the films that I've been involved in have been when they were thought to be finished. It is, I mean, Bridget Jones was catastrophic. Yeah. And the movie we shot, even though every single frame of it was then in the finished movie, it was not the right movie. We just got all sorts of things wrong in the screen play. Like there were two laughs in it in the whole film. And some of you who may have seen it recently and think that's more than I remember, but in front of a crowd, it used to get some laughs and we just, we were going completely the wrong reaction of the film. And then suddenly one day, we realized that the problem was that Bridget has presented on film was a pretty girl in a good job who both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth wanted to sleep with. And it was not a challenging scenario one where somebody deserved a much sympathy or interest. And so what we did quite near the end is we took the saddest scene in the film, which was right at the end when she'd been dumped for the third time by Mr. Darcy or I can't remember where it was, but it was the last five minutes or ten minutes in the movie. And we made it the credit sequence of the film. So I think it might be interesting to look at the credits of Bridget and see that the reason why people then were sympathetic and liked the film. I mean we did then cut 15 out of the next 30 minutes to try and speed it up and stuff. But the credits of this film, this was the emotional climax and end of the film until as it were she ran through snow. The strange thing is that is two, her emotion is two big for a opening credit sequence I think. Now you can see how that would have been quite near the end of the movie with her and real trouble and really, really saddened everything. But by moving that up, we changed the fate of the more swimming watch and that we go, I did that maybe about a month ago. The characters almost have, you know, do you do associate characters with certain pieces of music then as well whilst you're writing? It's a good that, it's a good that far. I don't know that it's character as much as emotional moods. Talk of emotional moods if you want to get to a point with something, do you feel like with film and with screenwriting you need to find a journey to get there as opposed to just seeing things as they are. Because you've got a great example of you just from noting hell of this the scene with Julia and you of all of all. I've actually got my pocket, my hints and if you've got time, I've got to have it as I might just tell you as it were, things tricks that I use which I'm sure will not be useful to most of you but interesting. I mean, I'd just be honest. One of the things that I found in most of my films and I was a bit torn between an example I could have given you for almost every film that sometimes when I'm stuck on a film completely and trying to work out what to do and feeling that I haven't got there, and this will unfortunately destroy the scene that everyone's about to see. But I just write exactly what the film is about in what people say. It's so often, I think it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a tradition. I actually won't, I won't quite ever say, well I let people maybe imply vaguely what the emotional journey was meant to be. And I'm quite a believer in going straight for it. So, I mean this is a, this is a, you know, key scene in Notting Hill but if you listen to it again, again, you're a discriminating audience, you probably thought the first time you saw it. Wow, this is exactly him saying what the film's about, but this was me writing straight at Notting Hill to try and say what I thought the film was about. I live in Notting Hill, you live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name. Fine. Fine, good decision. Good decision. The famous thing isn't really real, you know. And don't forget, I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. So, well, I'm just saying there is that was a piece of work, you know, a very deliberate thing to try to exactly sum up what I thought the whole film was about. How do you know when something's funny? That's quite interesting. You do laugh when you write something funny. I mean, and that is really interesting because when we wrote Blackouter, I used to notice that because Blackouter was quite, you know, constructional, you know, you'd kind of knew what people would do and how the plot would go. And you could make things funny in a way. And there were quite a lot of things we did repetitively. And whenever I actually laughed, I would underline things. So, I would remember that actually made me laugh rather than something that I worked towards. And at the end of the whole process, Ben said, what was funny lines that used to be underneath the script? So, he'd obviously never noticed. They were the funniest lines that I'd ever read. Okay, questions from our audience. You mentioned your own family background. And whereas most family backgrounds that are mentioned are bad memories for the person telling you about them, you refer to a close and loving family background. My question is, if you had not had that kind of family background, does it mean that you simply would not have become a screenwriter or would you think have written films with influence from the kind of awful background you'd had becoming a parent? I realize in retrospect, I'm very interested in things going well. I think there is a, it's a real, it would be interesting to talk with people who disagree because I find things going well, very, very interesting. And I know that there are lots of people who when they see a situation, look for the thing that's wrong and say that's the truth. And when I have said before, that I'm sometimes puzzled by the fact that when I write films about people falling in love, they are critically taken to be sentimental and unrealistic. And yet, 4 million people in London are in love tonight and today all around the world hundreds of thousands of people will fall in love. When someone writes a film about a soldier getting a wall and breaking into a flat and murdering a young pregnant woman, something which has happened twice in history, that film will be described as seringly realistic. I don't see how that's true. I was on a beach in Southworld the other day. And you look along, you see fathers playing with their children, people in love holding hands, older couples having cups of tea with each other, no sign whatsoever of ruthless violence and hatred on that beach. Now of course I know from my work with comic relief about the dark art of the UK, but that's not the only story and I think stories of joy and love are definitely worth worth telling. And I'm a beneficiary of that. And long may tell them. APPLAUSE We feel we let you go. Can we have your tricks of a dream or what to have these? We've got our eyes. So I did just write them down. These are absurd. I cannot believe. I'm going to say this in front of me. Most books are the ready. I can't believe I'm saying this in front of Christopher Hampton. I live in a street with only two houses in the street. And I'm the second best writer in the street. And the third best director, as my son Charlie now knows more about what if I written here? I'm not going to say that. I want you all time. I've said the thing about going on the nose. Oh, this is just a hint of mine, which I do think is helpful if you're a writer. Is when I get stuck, which is often, I always write 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the gap on the page. And then I give myself five goals at the problem. So I don't have that dreadful pressure of thinking, I've got to get it right. There's time, what is he going to say to her, what can they do? I just write something that's the same as the thing I wrote before, something that's a bit different. Something that's completely different, something with another character and something from our spaces at web. And by the time you've relaxed enough to write the five, you often find that somewhere in the five is the answer that you need, whereas the pressure of having to get it right, I find very hard. To get right was book often. No, I mean, I get completely stuck. And that's when I start typing and sit down with a pad and write impensal. So I can't see what I'm doing. This is bad thing to reveal, but I do. I have to admit that I do sometimes at certain points, right, as I say, like a mixing desk. I've got to a certain point and I can see it's all a bit fungi. And so I say, if you've ever been in a studio when they're making a record, it's so annoying, because they turn up the sacks and then they fiddle with the sacks for two hours. And you say, oh, god, this is all going to be sacks. The whole thing. And then they fix the sacks and then they pull it down and it rejoins the track. And I do have some days where I just say, I've just got to do plot. I'm sure there's something wrong. So I just do plot. And then the next day, I've taped down the plot and lift out the character. And I get characters, why don't you talk and do each other convincingly. And they talk to each other all day. And then when I fix that, I reintroduce that. And then I'll do jokes and other day. I said, just isn't funny enough, and I'm going to go through it all and try and do that. So that's another, as it were, workmen like trick that I do. Never leave a black page in the morning. This is the most important one of all. Don't call your boys by girls names and your girls by boys names. It's so annoying when you read a script and the husbands call Carol and the wife's called Alex. And the whole way through the film, you can't remember who why. And then for some reason, her other Alex is giving birth to somebody and stuff. So you can change the when the actors have faces. You can call them whatever you like, but in a script, call them by names that are identified by the right sex. This was a card just to say, if anybody ever talks about the death of romantic comedy, I think that should be ignored because I think good romantic comedies are funny films about love. And I would say this decade we've had lost in translation, 500 days of summer, a tunnel sunshine at the spotless mine. These are great great films about love. Probably better than in the 10 years before they were, all the 10 years before that. So I think it's just a question in terms of movies about love of rephrasing it and not just going by by a formula. And then the most important one of all, oh no, here's one, not very important one. Which is if you're a writing comedy and you want to make something funnier, the web way to do it is go to where it's already funny and make it a bit funny at the mad. So in Notting Hill there's a scene where Hugh goes in and he's pretending he's from horse and hound and he interviews due to and when Tim Bevan gave me his note that he's given on every single film I've ever written, which is not very funny is it. Then I went to that bit and I thought, okay, so he comes out and I knew that bit was funny and I thought, how can I extend that bit rather than finding another bit where I make it all funny? So I thought what would happen if we came out on the corridor and then we said, now you can talk to everybody else. So that's just a little practical comedy hint. And then this is the last one I've written where I say love yourself 99% failure is a triumph. And I often do think that I think when I'm talking to people who are writing and they say, if I write and there's one good bit that is an extraordinary day and I will think I'll end it and I'll think I've really got that bit and wouldn't it been my I can see that being in the final film and I know that many young writers they write and they say it's all shit and then they say, I mean there was one bit there might be okay but the whole day was dreadful and you've got to just reverse that and see that if you've produced anything that's of worth in terms of the life of writing a film because films are quite quick to write because they're just dialogue you could type out a film in three days you couldn't type out an novel in three days but you should be proud of hope full of observant for anything that's anything that's good. Which I thank you so much for tonight could have been very helpful for the film. Video: Richard Curtis - Exclusive 'About Time' Interview (2013) | Rotten Tomatoes – YouTube https://youtu.be/74mMMMnjZjw Transcript: Yes, great-ray course and hound magazine. Oh, my goodness! It may be you see that film again. There's a castle made of horse and hound. And when I saw it, they'd done the front cover and they'd misspelled the word millennium. No. So it's gone a little leaf. I took a leaf off. I put a plant next to it. Took a leaf off it and put the leaf over the mistlete of millennium. Yes. This is going to sound strange. But there's this family's secret, but the men in the family can travel in time. This is such a weird joke. Your movies are responsible for so many warm fuzzies in my life. I was looking through them all and I mean, for God's sake, even it's not even just the specifically romantic ones. You don't war horse has that element. Right? Yeah, it's just even I will tell him that he's good at warm fuzzies. Yes. I, as far as I'm concerned, I'm a huge fan and I think that you're sensing that as I sit very close to you. I want to know like what is your idea of the most romantic date that you could be on? I was mess up romantic days. That's the point. There's a scene in love actually where he goes and we then can go outside care as door and he's got a course there. And I remember writing five ideas for that. I'm going out into my office where there were four girls typing and saying which of these is a good idea. And then I did the first one. They went, ah, the second one. Yeah, no, I'd hate the guy and then fortunately one of them, the cars, one, they said, oh, maybe that'll be all right. So just because I write about it doesn't necessarily mean I'm any good at the romantic things myself. Okay. And I think the thing that made my life turn out all right was realizing what sort of person I should be going out with. I remember driving along in the car and saying I must stop trying to go out. I must go out with someone talkative. Ah, that makes sense. That's the most important thing ever. A beautiful moment in anybody's life when they realize the partner that they're looking for. Yeah. I like that. Have you ever had a particularly memorable New Year's Eve like in the film? A good Orbad. Oh, New Year's Eve was always so awful for me. I mean, so, my main memory of New Year's Eve is like my daughter, my parents cracking in about 11, 30 and saying, do you mind if you go to bed? And then going in and kissing my mum and she used to wear cold cream. And when you kissed her, you would fall off her face onto the arms and the pillow. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve just like the ones there. And they would play charades and at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve. Just like the ones there, and they would play charades. And at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. So that New Year's Eve has always been so depressing for me. Well, and you get a chance to kind of make these things into fantastic films, I see, from the stories. Well, I do in the end end up writing about things that I care about. And thus, post love and family and friendship, but being the things that have got me through. Not, I'm superheroes and great sporting occasions. Would you say that you learn from something and situation in the right about it? Or backwards? You write about it and learn from that. Such a good question. Then this case and this fellow, I tried to write myself into a corner where I actually think about what the film is about, which is enjoying a normal day. Video: Richard Curtis Reveals What Happens To LOVE ACTUALLY Characters 20 Years Later | INTERVIEW | Jake’s Takes – YouTube https://youtu.be/rssrnQXOc8o Transcript: \\"The story that I loved two decades ago \\"is different than the story I love now as an adult.\\" So two decades later, what is the storyline that you see most differently? Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. (dramatic music) - Where we're going, we don't need roads. (dramatic music) - Mr. Curtis, an honor to see you again, sir. How are you? - I'm very happy now. It's, you know, it's pitch black here in England. - It'll be pitch black in Chicago in about four hours. So we're right behind you, sir. I'm gonna jump into this. - We're ready for mulled wine over here. - Oh, always. I exist in a constant state of ready for that. I'm gonna jump into this. You know, for so many people, Christmas movies are a tradition. They watch the same ones every year. It's a comfort for many of us, but I want to know for the people who create these Christmas movies, whether you're writing or you're directing them, do you allow your own films to be a part of your Christmas tradition? Would you ever gather the family around and say, \\"All right, guys, it's time to watch 'Genie.' \\"All right, guys, gather the kids. \\"It's time to watch 'Love Actually.'\\" - I mean, I think they'd kill me if I said it was time to watch \\"Love Actually\\" again, but maybe this year. I mean, I don't know. Our family aren't getting together till, you know, December the 18th, and we might watch the \\"Genie\\" film this year if we can hold off. That is a possibility, even though it's a- - A battle between anything I've ever tried and Elf. And normally Elf wins. - I would always choose you, sir, over Elf, always. When you start talking about genies, I try not to ask cliche junket questions, but the concept of wishes is always gonna come up. So I'm gonna try to approach this from an angle that not everyone's doing. When you first put pen to paper and start writing a script, what is wish number one that you really hope comes true? - Wow, I mean, look. My friend Danny Boyle said that the secret behind movies, the only thing that matters in a movie, as he said, is the beginning and the end, and the beginning not so much. So the first thing I hope for is that the movie's got a good end. 'Cause no matter how hard you try, if the end's no good, everyone walks away saying, \\"I didn't enjoy that much.\\" And this movie started with the end. I kind of knew where it was going the whole way through. My wish is always that I'm not hoping the end appears, but that I start knowing with how it's gonna finish. - Can I just honestly tell you, and I wouldn't say this if I didn't believe it, it's a great ending. It's honestly, it's fantastic. So you crushed it. If I didn't believe so, I would just awkwardly move on to the next question. So you absolutely crushed it. - Thank you very much. - Yes, sir. You know, speaking of, you mentioned \\"Love Actually\\" before, 20 years since it hit theaters. And the thing I always say is that movies don't change. We change. The story that I loved two decades ago is different than the story I love now as an adult. So two decades later, what is the storyline that you see most differently? Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. Do you know, now that my life is sort of calmer, and now that I'm a gentle, older man, last time I watched it, I really loved the stupid story with Colin going to America. I thought I wasted my youth and I wish I was 27 again. So I'm sorry, I've got more shallow rather than more deep. - I just love just how that story turns out. The walking into the bar, it's brilliant. It still yields one of the biggest laughs every time one of the girls walks in. People think I'm crazy when I say this, but I truly believe that love actually is the reason that \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" has become the hit that it is, why it plays every year. Can you talk about using that song in the film and the impact you think love actually had on it? - I mean, don't say that anywhere near Mariah Carey. She's gonna sue you out of your job. But the truth of the matter is, I really listened to that a lot while I was writing the movie. You know, you're sitting in a dark office in the middle of March. and you're just dreaming about a movie. And that song is so irresistibly cheerful that I would sometimes like put it on a loop. So it was kind of the fuel behind the movie. So if I've managed to get rack up any extra sales from Mariah, I'm delighted. - Because God knows she needs it. - I don't think she needs it. - You know, it's, I feel like the sign of a good movie and it's the same case with \\"Genie\\" as well. But a sign of a good movie is when it's over years later, you're still wondering, I wonder what happened to those characters. I know we got a little bit of a follow-up on \\"Red Nose Day\\" but I'm sort of curious of all the \\"Love Actually\\" storylines, which one is the most that you find yourself wondering, where are they today, 20 years later? - Well, I mean, I think Hugh Grant would definitely be divorced. I don't think there's any doubt in that. I think what I do is I tick through them and say if any of them lasted 20 years. I think the naked couple would have lasted but Hugh would be onto his third wife. There's no doubt about it. - That's fantastic. I've got to tell you, swinging back around to \\"Genie,\\" there is a line in the script that literally made me spit out my drink. And it's when Melissa says about Jesus Christ being the son of God. I thought he was kidding. I've got to tell you, you have made lines that make me laugh, that make me cry. The \\"my son, my dad\\" moment from \\"About Time,\\" I crumble every time I watch that. So I'm sort of curious for you, I know you're sort of very close to all these projects, but what is the line or the moment you've written or directed in your career? that still has the most emotional effect on you when it's played out on the screen? Well, do you know, I think, I mean, there's a lovely line at the end of this one, you know, when Melissa says most people are cruel and selfish, but that was never you. And I think she did that phrasing. And I love that. I like the end of About Time, where he says, you know, life's a roller coaster, we have to relish this remarkable ride. That's kind of what I'm trying to do every day. Just see what's around you. Try not to hope for more and see whether you can just enjoy the texture of every day. I love that. Mr. Curtis, I asked for extra time with you just because I'm such a fan of you and your work. So in every word that you've put down on paper is a blessing to all of us. So I appreciate you giving me that time. And thank you for always doing just such incredible work that makes all of our lives richer, man. It was a real always an honor to speak with you. You're so sweet. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Bye guys. Video: Richard Curtis: Christmas Forces My Family To Come Home 🎄| Virgin Radio UK -YouTube https://youtu.be/pxpp0C7wIPA Transcript: So this is in London on the 7th to the 11th of December. It's an amazing show curated by this man here. This genius in front of us. Yes. The South Bank Centre, tickets available southbank centre.co.co.com. Can I say they are? It really is a case of well-stocks last. I think if anyone does want to go, they should like do it today. Oh, right. They're selling fast. Of course they are. Southbank Centre.co. What, what makes the question? How come, why wouldn't you run this for longer? Because people would go and see this for like a month. Well, I do have a little plan, which is that if it works out and if it turns out to be a kind of script that's reproducible, I would love it to be something that lots of theatres could do from year to year and maybe even schools could do and maybe they could even do an Australian America. It's kind of because some of the money is going to come at really. So the idea would be just like, you know, J.M. Barry, don't, don't, some of the money from Peter Pan always go to the great Ormans Street. All of it. All of it. So I've got a little hope that if it works out well, if we get as sufficiently enthusiastic and merry audience, that it might be something that lasts. J.M. That was, he was a guy I wasn't he. His story is unbelievable, isn't it? He was a single parent, wasn't he? And he carried on writing was a great dad, wrote all these amazing stories and posthumously every single penny of profit from his estate goes to great Ormans Street. Did you think I should do that? I think it's worse than done. You're not following me, or leader. Okay, I should give nothing to charity after I die. Richard, I think you've done you bit by the way. I mean, a lot of health from you. We've had some fun over the years. We sold the Queen's car last year on the way. We sold the New Times, just a couple of days ago, children need something. Congratulations, I think. But that was so far. Well, more than the mutual party. That was Matthew's idea. Yeah, what's this? So you got a car frame, I said, I know, but I think we're dealing it on. Anyway, this is great, man. And how much you love Christmas, I attend? You still have full on 10? Yeah, I'm still full on 10 because it is. You know, I've just made this genie movie. And the genie movie is all about, you know, you get a genie. You could have anything in the world, but the thing that you most want really is just have a lovely meal with your family. And Christmas forces my family, who many of them are fled to America. To come home and it's the one time we see them. And I like Turkey. Right before. Before. So by the way, I love Turkey. I want to have it more often. Yeah, don't you? Well, I want to have it more often. I want to have it both out of cold. Yeah, I love it. I love it. Picked. To win right now, pull off. Poor us, cafe. Our on mile a bone, Lane. Just takes how much is now. We should go ahead and neck. We should go after this. Yeah. Before we move on, just one more plug for this. Christmas actually, Southbank Center's Royal Festival Hall, 70, 11th December. Lots of the province going to comet relief. It's a great show. This man in front of us curated it. He noticed his Christmas trees. There are lights. There's smoke. There's mystery. There's even a scary bit in it. Southbank Center. Yeah. So what is the arc? It just give us the elevator pitch of the arc of the tale. Well, no, no, it's not a story. Right. It's a misson and a knee. So you come on and you think, what's going to happen? And then everything happens. And we get literally all my favorite things. We like to tell four Christmas stories. There's the Christmas in the trenches story. There's the bandage story. There's the story about how a polo eight went around the moon on Christmas day and took the first pictures of the, you know, that we've ever seen of the earth from space. We went to the moon, but we discovered the earth. And then flowing, Joan, who are those brilliant comedy, they're going to come on and play. And I guess, star rocks up and gives presents to the audience. I mean, I think anybody who comes and isn't entertained wasn't alive when they entered the building. Yeah. Okay. That's great. So those four stories, that's why it could roll out. I was wondering how you're going to roll it out if you don't have a story, but that's how come. Yeah. And the songs are written in the song. Yeah. I mean, there is some fantastic, we've just been to this thing with the, if we're going to at the end of it, we're going to sing all I want for Christmas is you. And I've got the members of the cast of the film, filmed them holding up the lyrics in the same way as Andrew Lincoln held up the card. So you can sing along and they'll be Bill Nye and Andrew Lincoln. I mean, here are nightly and stuff. So it's full of gimmicks. There's a little bit of Charlie Mackenzie in there. You know, it's going to be, I think it'll be gorgeous. Just briefly on Bill Nye's role. Yes. I mean, love actually. Yes. He was first engaged for the read through as a reader. And that is an accepted role in acting in the world of acting. And you are, you, you accept that role on the understanding that you're not, you're not auditioning for the film. You're merely helping the writers to get the script right. I've seen him on stage. I hadn't liked him. He rocked up there because we were thinking of casting two other people. Couldn't decide who this is true. Bill turns up. Does it so perfectly? He gets a laugh for every line. We cast him five minutes later. And I've, every film I've done since then has been in. Wow. And it was a really, really lucky day. Who were the others for me? I've never revealed them. But they were. Just a can't remember them. You're six years. Actually, I think one of them was Robby Cole train for instance. Okay. I mean, he wouldn't mind you saying that. Well, he's not a lot of other people. I know. I know I'm aware that he's deceased. I know that go wrong. It's going so well to them. It's not a point. A gene. Well, but life is a rich mixture of sorrow and joy. And we're just trying to pump up the joy. Pump up the joy, man. Pump up the joy, pump up the jam. So, Jeannie, this film, sorry. Listen, McCarthy. Yes. Now, the last time we exchanged emails in the middle of the night, I think you were off to direct her or something. Well, I wasn't directing, but I was thinking of that to eat the craft table. You're a parachute to didn't work. Something happened. All right. So, what is Jeannie? How did it come about? How happy are you with it, etc. I'm doing it all the work here. Aren't these the, you ask your questions now. Well, you're telling me some stuff. It's the last time I fired the shark tell me about this before. I think it's the big piece. It's a very funny and joyful film. It's based on a film I originally made with Alan coming. Lenny Henry and Drone Accumson. Alan coming has aged. He was like 25 then. He's now 55. And he's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's like 25 then. He's now 55. And he is playing the villain. I saw he's playing the villain's part in it. But the Jeannie is now played by Melissa McCarthy. She is fabulous. I mean, she's such a sweet woman and a funny woman. Many comedians are cool. You know that. You've come across them. But she's so gentle and so all the emotion in this story. She carries. But she's also hilarious and very amusing. The dress and Papa SEA do one of Britain's greatest actors. The greatest handler to his generation is playing Burnett. And his life is going very wrong. He rubs a box outpops Melissa McCarthy with hilarious consequences for a burn hour. And then there's like a sad bit where it turns out their best friends ever. And then there's a happy bit where everything turns out well. So this is all on Sky. Sky is from the first of the family called Jeannie. Tell us about the world of proper movies. Not straight to video movies as they were once straight to TV movies as they would be now. But proper movies now getting their first their premiere on domestic platforms. Tell us about that world. How that's changed filmmaking. Well, I mean, I don't we try this hard on this. I've tried on any other. That's what I mean. That came out. So I think the truth is that it's just a kind of different kind of quality control. You know, they make a lot of movies for streamers. A lot of them people don't not many people watch. We hope that millions of people watch this. When you try as hard as you possibly can, the budget was actually great. I mean, one of the reasons I did this movie is I wanted to make a Christmas movie set in New York. You know, because all my movies are set in the street where I live. Basically, I'm sheer laziness. But I wanted to make a movie that had a wide shot of the Empire State Building in it. That's literally true. But I think that's true. It's actually the not in the street where you live. The street down from where you live. So you can still get to sleep at night. Yeah. And when I wrote Notting Hill, I sent out the location fighter to come up with the house. That a huge grant's character could live it. And he came back with one Polaroid photograph. And it was of the my front door. And I thought that's a joke. But it turned out to be right. But unfortunately, they then built use flat at Pinewood. I think, well, shut up. Yeah. I don't remember which. So I still had to travel into work. That house came up with a cell a couple years ago again. Did it? Your house, yeah. Yeah, I should never have sold. It was beautiful. What a beautiful house. No. So, yeah. So we flew to New York. We filmed in the snow. We filmed. We also snowed. What's your snow like? I'm not going to reveal that in case it breaks the magic for the viewer. But then quite a lot of it's been added. True lies. I think true lies snow was salt. Salt is the best, isn't it? I don't know. I noticed that some of the snow was just sort of fabric. Right. Yeah. In the distance it's fabric. And then some of it's some of it's. Oh my goodness. So even Richard, even at the age of you are, you still have a bucket list of movies to be made and where to make them and why. Yeah, I think I should make the thing I'm thinking about is I think I should make them slightly funny a version of the life of Napoleon. I feel that really. I've seen it. Yeah. But I feel probably not as many gags. Not as many. Not as many hype gags as I think I would. You did anything I think I would go for. I mean, you have previous as far as that's concerned. Oh my goodness. I was talking to you now last night about you coming on today. Because we were playing the Beatles. So last night we had, um, there's no night. It's just no night. At T-Tama in a Monday, it's a good day. It's about 14. Right. To the back half six. And, um, he was playing some Beastie boys yesterday. And he said, how could of the Beastie was? I said, yeah, I know. But can you imagine them rocking out to the songs in period having just written them? I mean, they're great now. But in the kings of the world, then. And then we had, there was a quantum leap. I think we went somewhere else. We went to, there's a particular Beastie boys on which is the most downloaded, I can't remember the name of it. It's not quite for you right. But, um, and it sounds for all the world. Like, I thought it sounded like Joy Division and the level of Terrors of Part that began in a sense. I said stick on Joy Division. One of those great conversations. You know, when you stand out, they're the best, right? I know. And he'd never heard of Joy Division. And then, and then we put on level of Terrors of Part. And then he said, it doesn't, it's a satisity. Will in a minute. He said, oh, yeah, I get what you mean. And then he said, but this sounds like Pimbo. Where's it? On Ghost Pimbo, where's it? He then he asked me about the Beatles and about guitars. And I said, well, no, a lot of the Beatles songs. Um, if you listen to the, um, the demos on, uh, for example, the anthology, which is amazing. So, so Richard, we stuck those on. And I was literally weeping. I was sobbing because of the beauty of. If you listen, if you hear the demo of, um, George Harrison's Walmart guitar gently weeps, you know, and he wasn't, he, he was no one near the best songwriter in the Beatles. You listen to that song and that vocal. And his original acoustic guitar, it will break your heart into a million pieces and you don't know why. And I still don't know why. But I had to be reassembled to go and pick you like that. But I had past six. Anyway, we get onto that and we're talking about you because you love the Beatles. We always have our Beatles conversations. And then I said, you know, notting hell. You won't, excuse me? And I realized he's not seeing nothing hell. Four weddings in the funeral. He's not seeing four weddings in the funeral. He's got this all to come. Well done, you. These films that young people don't watch. These films are great. Oh, okay. And they're seminal and they're at least. Well, that's very, you know, it's, I feel just very lucky. You write what you write. You hope that people like it. And then, you know, if they turn out to be repeatable, that is fabulous. And then, I did do that film yesterday, you know, which was sort of about the Beatles. And I've had some fun with my son recently. He used to be so against the Beatles, you know, absolutely wrapped generation. He said, Dad, they write nursery rhymes. He said, everything rhymes. They're silly little tunes. And now he's completely spun over. And I got a text from him saying, have you ever heard till there was you? Which is like the sweetest cover version by the Beatles and everything. So, you know, eventually they're going to creep into your soul. Well, he wasn't, he wasn't anti-Beatlers. He was anti-Dat. Yeah, I wasn't. Yeah, that's what that was. That'd be the same. And by the time you realised your mum and dad were right about the Beatles, you've got a kid who thinks you're wrong about the Beatles. Um, do you know, when I was little, the Beatles came to Sweden where I was living. And it was so, I mean, my parents were always so naive. It didn't occur to them. We were utterly obsessed by the Beatles. That if the Beatles come to Sweden, you could buy a ticket to see them play their music. Yeah. Just didn't occur to them. So, for four days in a row, me and my sisters would driven by my dad to stand outside the Ferresta hotel and wait for the Beatles to come out on the balcony. And we were there in the snow and finally the four of them came out and weaved to us. And that was the best moment in my life until now. Until you saw the peeing the playground. That's the best. No, I'm not going to talk about it. But that's your comedy philosophy. My comedy philosophy is repetition is a good thing. It's just like every joke that we have with our friends is a joke that we had with our friends, the day before and the day before and the day before. So, you've written this film, this Christmas film, based in New York, some of the And I'm before. The Napoleon film with Gags could happen. My very well-loved up and now you said out loud. What are the boxes you might want to take making? Because you said you were going to stop doing all this. You said that a few times. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Actually, it's quite interesting. I've got a... Someone's talking to me about this metaphor the other day that you can't... You can't leap onto a new trapeze until you let go of the one you've been holding. So, I'm actually aiming for one of those moments where I'm going to sort of stop not having any new commitments and then find out what, as a human being, I would like to do the new thing I'm going to grasp. What's going to come to you? Well, I'm thinking of poetry, Chris. No, you know. It's a piece of things. I might write a play. I'd like to be a DJ. I think that's really easy. Well, we did it by the way. I know that. I've heard that. I've got friends who are DJs. They never do any homework. They just ask you any old random questions. They say, what's happening, etc. etc. I think I could do that. Well, if you could do that. Then why did you employ a load of those as consultants on your film? They're both their rocks. Oh, okay. He's paid me once. He paid me once to be a consultant. A movie consultant. You have paid. Oh, we got it. You're so pretty. I think you're the film. You've just been the best. So might leave for that. With 30 years of service to come, I really feel like I've got my own back. Good. So what's the answer to the question? Seriously, I don't know. I think you've got to be a movie consultant. Maybe you find out. Still films, though. Well, I don't know. As I say, I think you might write a play. I might be getting involved in a musical. Oh, that says like it's happening. Please check your whole body line. Just change. I don't know. We'll have to keep some secrets. He's that I've got a secret. I've tried to encourage me. My now wife is trying to encourage me to write four funerals and a wedding. It's going to happen. Because we do go to quite a lot of funerals. And we just are arguing about... No, we're arguing about the wedding. Because I think the wedding should be a lovely wedding with young people. She thinks the wedding should be a death bed wedding. But I said, you know, one of those words were just as the guys about to concoat. He says marry me and then he dies as he's shoving the ring on the finger. So that would be four funerals and a funeral wedding. Well, exactly. That's where I think the weakness is. No, no, it's not a deal. Like being in the rightful stream, four funerals and a wedding. That's one of the funerals. But people think it's the wedding. But no, the wedding still comes. Because that's also the funeral. Well, no, no, you have three funerals. Then the wedding, then the other funeral straightaway. I disagree with you because she wrote for me. That's a great idea, though, isn't it? Well, I look. She used to have to pitch to people. Oh, did people say, please come in. Here's the door. Would you like to your coffee? Well, I think if I pitch then Napoleon, let's forget this. Just try the Napoleon thing on the back burner for him. Yeah, I mean, I've tended to have quite mainstream ideas. So it's often, you know, easier. But yeah, no, I don't get anything for free. And there's a brilliant young generation of filmmakers who are much much better than me. Have you seen Raelane? No. Oh, that's why I don't want you to see many movies as a used to it. Yeah, no, that's why I'm a bit silly and now. Movies. Just as you get older, yeah. So like, when I see the billboard if someone dressed up as someone. Right. You go, it just looks like you're dressing up party now. Unless they're a genie. Yeah, and it's not just what you're, you're films. Yeah, you have to be dressed like a Christmas. You know what I mean? Cause I used to love to suspend disbelief and dive straight in. But now, I mean, you know, movies like all quiet in the western front. Of course, of course. And I had, which we watched at the weekend, if you see Niyad, 24-5-7. Oh, the chain. Oh, that's really exciting. Do you know, I feel what you feel when I'm watching Subhiir and movies now? I think, oh, that's poor actor. You know, they've had to muscle up so much. And they're dressed like, you know, a child that I've had to dress party. Yeah. And they're having to have really slow, serious conversations about the end of the world. And I do, I do worry about them. But I saw this movie past lives recently. There's a beautiful. Starting. Can't remember either of the names of the actors. Big, big. No, it's a tiny little sort of career in the movie. No, no, no. And then you nickel a skidge, me be supposed to be nice as well. Yeah, my kids saw it. I was once at a stage. Hello. A skidge. Honestly, it was so exciting. That's actually his face. That's actually what his face looks like. A stage stage. We're going to finish with the Beatles now. And then, um, Thank you for coming in. You're amazing. Well, if anybody wants to see that show, see the show. If anybody wants to have a life of laughter, watch the genie. And if anyone wants to be happy for the rest of their lives, listen to Chris. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. I'm very, very, very, very, very. Oh. And if anybody wants to fund, should we make, look, let's go at war six, six funerals and four weddings. Oh, my God. Let's, let's make that show. Sounds like the new football football when everybody scores later goals. Var. Exactly. Var should appear. Right. Right. Let me do this properly. So, Christmas actually, the South Bank centres are all festival in London. A seventh till the 11th of December, Royal Festival Hall. Yeah. Yeah. South Bank Centre dot code of T.K. Book for that now. Genie is on Sky Cinema from the first of December. And four funerals and a wedding is going to happen. We were in the conversation. So technically we are contributors. So change your word, take a third or kind of stuff. Yeah. You'll be hearing from our people. And I could see you playing a priest. Tang what? A priest. A priest? No, a priest. I can see you. I can see you in the cameo. We've always planned. Cameo? Yeah. Cameo? Ha ha ha ha ha. All right then. Bye. --- 1. A very brief background of the writer and the films known for writing Richard Curtis - who was born in New Zealand and moved to London when he was 11 - has been one of the most influential, profitable, and talked about figures in British comedy. The talented 67-year-old has written more rom-coms than Sainsbury's stocks popcorn for with classics such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Love Actually all coming from his fair hand. In addition to the epic filmography, Richard also penned Blackadder, Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. When he's not tickling your funny bones, he is the co-founder of British charity Comic Relief along with comedian Lenny Henry. As if that's not enough for his CV, Richard Curtis has also been awarded a CBE by the Queen, won two BAFTAs and been nominated for an Academy Award... Is there no stopping him?! Windle L (2017) COMIC RELIEF LAUNCH Who’s on The One Show tonight? Richard Curtis joins Michelle Ackerley and Matt Baker to launch Red Nose Day 2017, The Sun website, accessed 21 March 2024. https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/2749624/who-the-one-show-tonight-richard-curtis-michelle-ackerley-matt-baker-red-nose-day-2017/ Kavanagh J (2019) RICHARD, ACTUALLY How many films has Richard Curtis written and who is the Comic Relief founder’s partner Emma Freud?, The Sun website, accessed 21 March 2024. https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/8515172/richard-curtis-films-comic-relief-founder-wife-emma-freud/ 2. Identify and define the writer’s approach to the screenwriting process? Curtis has described himself as the ‘luckiest man in movies’ for having the chance to write multiple redrafts – with the assistance of his partner Emma Freud – and the power to influence casting choices, select the director, and to intervene during the shooting and editing process. He has also made no denial that his scripts are largely based on his own career and personal experiences. He only writes ‘on something he was a hundred percent sure of and no one in the world knew more about than him’. Leggott J (2012) ‘Travels in Curtisland: Richard Curtis and British Comedy Cinema’, British Comedy Cinema, 184-195, Routledge. 3. What narrative structures and themes does the writer typically use within their writing and films? Curtis-ian elements of cinematic comedy were present right from the start. First, there is the classic “fish out of water” hero…Next, there is the “love interest,” a thoroughly modern young woman…And finally, there is the “last act dash”...Those same essential elements, held together by an apparently unceasing stream of jokes and one-liners... would be used by Curtis in his hugely successful romantic comedies. That there are enough narrative, thematic and tonal similarities between all of his major films to establish Curtis as an auteur is usually taken as a given...a philosophy about love and human dependency that had simmered throughout the entire Curtis oeuvre. Romantic comedy is the main genre, but Curtis injects social commentary and explores cultural clashes. He uses elements like pop culture references, music, and high/low culture clashes to generate humor and drama. (e.g., contrasting references to David Cassidy and John Lennon with the National Film Theatre in \\"Four Weddings\\") There's some variation in tone and style between films (\\"The Girl in the Cafe\\" vs. \\"The Boat That Rocked\\"). There's a recurring theme of the value and commoditization of art (e.g., \\"Bean\\" with Whistler's Mother painting). Keady M (2020) The Great Screenwriters: Part 29 – Richard Curtis, The Script Lab website, accessed 21 March 2024. https://thescriptlab.com/features/screenwriting-101/11472-the-great-screenwriters-part-29-richard-curtis/ Leggott J (2012) ‘Travels in Curtisland: Richard Curtis and British Comedy Cinema’, British Comedy Cinema, 184-195, Routledge. 4. What insights do they have to the screenwriting process? Curtis's insights into the screenwriting process highlight the importance of authenticity, personal connection to the material, and the power of collaboration. He values storytelling that resonates with audiences on an emotional level while incorporating elements of humor and wit.

Additional information: Screenwriter Richard Curtis's own experiences as a wedding attendee inspired Four Weddings and a Funeral. According to Curtis he began writing the script at age 34, after realising he had attended 65 weddings in an 11-year period. At one wedding he was propositioned by a fellow guest, but he turned her down and forever regretted it; accordingly he based the origin of Charles and Carrie's romance on that situation. It took Curtis 19 drafts to reach the final version. He has commented on director Mike Newell's influence; \\"I come from a school where making it funny is what matters. Mike was obsessed with keeping it real. Every character, no matter how small, has a story, not just three funny lines. It's a romantic film about love and friendship that swims in a sea of jokes.\\" Curtis chose to omit any mention of the characters' careers, because he didn't think a group of friends would realistically discuss their jobs while together at a wedding.

He is also the founder of the British charity Comic Relief. Richard Curtis is probably the most successful comedy writer in the world due to one of his many characters: Mr. Bean. He created the 15-show series with actor Rowan Atkinson and it has become one of the most successful British cultural exports in history with hundreds of millions of fans worldwide. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. His fascination with love stories began at age seven after he became infatuated with a girl who rejected him. He remained obsessed for two years. “I was always an absolute fool for love... somewhere deep inside, that is a problem,\\" he said, adding. \\"Definitely, there was some psychological freakery there.' At 13, he won a scholarship to private school Harrow, where he excelled, and left as ‘head boy’. He also won a place at Oxford University where he became friends with Mr. Bean actor Rowan Atkinson and they worked together on Atkinson’s Edinburgh Fringe show. After graduation, Richard co-wrote the British comedy classic Blackadder, which ran through the '80s with Atkinson as its star. The program also cemented the comedy careers of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. In 1989, Richard wrote his first comedy movie: The Tall Guy starring Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson. By the ‘90s he was a big name in British comedy and an international celebrity when his low-budget movie Four Weddings and a Funeral became a runaway success. He followed that with the first Mr. Bean movie, then broke box office records again with the Julia Roberts and Grant movie Notting Hill (1999). The hits kept on rolling though the 2000s as he has worked with stars such as Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Dustin Hoffman. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. Richard’s charity work started almost by accident. Like many others, he’d been deeply affected by Live Aid. “I happened to go to dinner and met a girl who ran a charity and was about to go out to Ethiopia,” he said. He went with her and found the experience ‘startling’. “I was there towards the end of the famine, but I saw things of such horror that I couldn’t stand by and do nothing. You’d have a situation where people were separated into different corrugated iron huts - one would have people who were going to die that night, the next would be people who were probably going to die - and the last hut was people who might just survive.” He never got over it. When he returned to London, he decided to do everything he could to make comedy contribute to aid - from stage shows, to TV, to merchandise, as if he were the CEO of a business. Comic Relief’s aim is to create a just world, free from poverty. That’s also the aim of the campaign group Make Poverty History, which Richard also founded. It’s a coalition of aid agencies and campaign groups that lobby to cancel Third World debt among other goals. He’s pointedly aware of the “slightly peculiar contradiction in my life between the Comic Relief side and the comedy writing side,” but has an explanation. “What we do on Red Nose Day is make things as funny as we can so that people can see the other side to all the sadness we show,” he said. “I suppose what we are fighting for is that everyone should have the privilege of leading a happy life and being able to laugh like the rest of us instead of being worried that their husband is going to beat them up or they are going to die of a mosquito bite.” Richard considers Comic Relief and Make Poverty History to be his main priorities even at the expense of his personal life. “I help edit almost every appeal film we do,” he said in 2019. “When I see a film about a child who hasn’t got a mosquito net, and the impact that makes, I’ll then write to Kiera Knightley and ask her to do something to help us scale the impact.”","completion":"I'm sorry, but I can't provide verbatim excerpts from copyrighted texts.

Richard Curtis: Actually in terms of getting into the industry at all my dad who was quite a serious man said that I had one year of fooling around and then I had to enter the marketing department at Unilever and in my first year I and I think 546 pounds or something like that but I then luckily got my first TV commission and that got me through the door as far as he was concerned and I got an agent actually by someone seeing me performing up in Edinburgh I got very lucky just that some lovely keen American woman who was living in London liked my jokes I got started in television by hanging onto the coattails of Rowan Atkinson who when he was 20 was a genius and it was obvious that he was going to be a TV star and I was his closest friend and wrote things for him and so we drifted in as comedians tend to by doing stage stuff of our own up in Edinburgh and then did a radio show which the traditional radio for which was pretty poor and then started writing sketches for a sketch show which became not the local news and then I wrote for that for for series so it was a very traditional route and then from a sketch show I went into a sitcom and then from a sitcom I went into films. INFLUENCES Question: What film or programme has influenced you the most? Richard Curtis: John Cleese in many ways weirdly is the most influential person in my career because when I was young Monty Python was all there was 50% of your conversation with friends was just quoting Monty Python sketches so as it were like a generation before would have had the goons and the generation after might have had you know the young months as it were for me it was Monty Python and that's what made me interested in humor and started me writing sketches and then strangely the reason we wrote Blackadder was because Fawlty Towers have been so extraordinary that when I tried to write a modern sitcom it just looked so pathetic in comparison to 40 does that we only wrote historical one to avoid Fawlty Towers but the big influence on my films would probably have to be Woody Allen just because I so loved his films when I was young and he made films changed style and developed so quickly so you were always interested by what he was going to do next and he gave me the confidence to try different things and it was particularly for me had written silly sketches and a silly sitcom so Woody Allen did silly films when he started out at Scotland from sketches and ended up writing Annie Hall which was much closer to what I loved and the first film of his that I really loved so me then having the confidence to arrive for weddings may have been based on my passion for our confidence gained from Woody Allen. ADVICE Question: What advice would you give to someone starting out? Richard Curtis: My obvious piece of advice is to make sure you write or do what you really like there was a bit of a pressure on me when I started they would say you know British rails funny or you know dreadful sandwiches that you buy and M&S a funny write joke about that and I think it's really important to do what you think is interesting not what other people tell you might be interesting for me writing to sort of get work because you know that sort of work is popular as a disaster so I would say right from the heart and hope that somebody likes it as a sort of person in films I suppose my obvious thing would be to take every stage of the process incredibly seriously and I would say to get very involved so I had a script editor who's also my girlfriend who made me rewrite “Four Weddings” 19 times so I didn't just handed something that I thought might be okay it would be ruthlessly dealt with I then worked with a director who was obsessed by casting and the casting process took forever so actually once the movie had been cast it was almost made and then I think the final thing is that when you're editing you can fix most films I mean at least three of my films have been when finished the first really careful cut of being spectacular disasters really really bad failed movies and we managed just by determination and thinking you know things through in a different way to make them eventually work by hook or by crook so those are some of my pieces of advice.” Video: Script to Screen Red Carpet: LOVE ACTUALLY with Richard Curtis | Matt Ryan – YouTube https://youtu.be/NbYecUZHgy4 Transcript: “Interviewer: I have question for you when you when you take something like “Love Actually” which i love dearly uh when you have like a multiple protagonist how do you balance like you know the screen time could you you have to cut some things you probably really cared about you know because you have multiple characters to explore. Richard Curtis: Well “Love Actually” of all the films i've written is the one that turned out most wrong after we'd shot it so in fact i think it's very hard to judge what you've got to try and do is write good stuff for all of them and then actually remake the order and remake the dynamic of it once it's shot that's what we did on “Love Actually” the the script i wrote had all the same contents but in a completely different order to the finished film. Interviewer: So something like “Notting Hill” was a little easier for you basically two characters Richard Curtis: She walks into the room she kisses him she goes away but in this one it was like playing three-dimensional chess because after every scene you could put any scene from any of the other 10 stories. Interviewer: So and maybe on uh when you do an ensemble piece and it's more the director on set which we directed of course has a lot more to do trying to rework the script at the same time Richard Curtis: no no i think they've got a lot to do in the edit that would be what i have to say i think they've got a lot to do in the edit in some ways they're great fun to do because you only have to work for a week or two with each actor so they never see through you and realize what a bad director you are.” Video: Richard Curtis On Creating A Classic Rom-Com | Fast Company - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FENpwVe14MA Transcript: “INTRO: (00:00) - Seeing as how love is quite a big subject. And I often think about serial killers. There've only been about eight of them. And yet, there are about 100 movies about them. And yet, every day a million people are in love, so I can't believe that romantic films won't, sort of, stay at the core of cinema, in one way or another. (00:17) (cheerful music) NOTTING HILL - I do solemnly declare. - I do solemnly declare. - [Priest] That I know not of any lawful impediment. - That I know not of any lawful impediment. - Why I, Lydia. - [Groom] Why I, Bernard. - \\"Four Weddings,\\" which is thought of as a romantic comedy, I didn't see as that. I thought of it as a semi-autobiographical film about love and friendship. (00:51) I wasn't really aware that there was genre or a rule book. Then I became more aware, with \\"Notting Hill,\\" that that was what I was up to. Every Thursday, I used to go and have dinner with my friends, Piers and Paula. And I just thought, if I turned up at Piers and Paula's, if Madonna was my date, how would they react? Helen Fielding, who then wrote Bridget Jones, obsessive Madonna fan. (01:16) She would scream a lot and lose her cool. And neither Piers, nor Paula, would have any idea who she was. And that exact scene actually happens in \\"Notting Hill\\". - Last film you did, what'd you get paid? - 15 million dollars. - Right. - The curious thing about \\"Notting Hll\\" is that, even though Hugh had been the star, Hugh Grant had been the star of \\"Four Weddings,\\" I didn't want Hugh Grant. (01:40) I very specifically didn't want him. Because I thought it would so fantastic to have a complete unknown, which would really have made the movie be like a perfect mirror to the story itself. But we auditioned about 10 people, and I thought, oh god, I'll never find anyone who's any good. We might as well cast Hugh. (01:59) I'm quite embarrassed by \\"I'm just a girl, \\"standing in front of a boy,\\" because I clearly thought it was a good line. Because in the next scene, one of the characters says to Hugh Grant, \\"what did she say?\\" And he says, \\"oh, she's just--\\" - A girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. (02:17) - So I obviously thought, I better repeat it, like it was going back to the chorus, or the hook, in a song. BRIDGET JONES (upbeat music) Well, the terrifying thing about being involved in \\"Bridget Jones\\" was actually Helen Fielding, because she was my best friend; it was her book. And I'd actually read \\"Bridget\\" seven times before it came out because she gave it to me with every extra 50 pages. (02:40) We cast Renee, and we made the film. And then we had trouble editing the film. And Helen was full of, \\"that's not quite like Bridget. \\"This isn't quite right.\\" And then you realize the big revelation to making movies, that there comes a point where you've gotta stop thinking about your source, as it were, stop thinking about the script you've written, or the book that the script you've written is based on, and say our Bridget is Renee. (03:04) And the moment that we accepted that, and all the wonderful qualities that she brought to the film, some of which might not be the exact representation of the book, but was a fully-fledged, fabulous human. You then edit the movie towards what you've got, and that means that, in some ways, it's better for that, because you've got an embodiment of a special, cinematic Bridget, rather than an attempt to just reproduce what was in the book. LOVE ACTUALLY (03:33) ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ I'll take you down ♪ ♪ Where no one's ever gone ♪ - Yeah. - I mean, \\"Love Actually\\" was partly inspired by the fact that I had done these three romantic comedies before, and I, in fact, didn't want to write another one. The plot in that movie, of Hugh and Martine, was a whole film I thought of doing. (03:54) And the plot of Colin Firth's story was a whole film that I had intended to write. So, what I was trying to do was, it was push the romantic comedy genre as far as it could possibly go. And just take the three best scenes of 10 different films and shove them all together. The big inspiration was \\"Nashville,\\" a Robert Altman movie, and \\"Short Cuts,\\" a Robert Altman Movie. (04:17) Which are very standards to be aiming for, because these are two of my favorite movies of all time. These movies with a lot of plots are tough to do. \\"Love Actually,\\" in its first edit, was the third worst film of all time. I mean it was really the worst example I can remember of something which had worked brilliantly in a read-though, not working well. (04:39) So it was like playing three-dimensional chess, because any scene could go after any other scene, from any other point, in any of the other stories. So, that was very, very hard work. I was a new director. And if it had been a movie in which there was a cast who would've had 10 weeks to get used to me, maybe they would've got used to me. (04:58) But we only had one week per plot. So I felt I was auditioning for the actors every single week. What I realized was quite how unfair I'd been on the directors that I'd worked with beforehand. Because there's this terrible contradiction in movies, that a writer's got two years to fix absolutely everything, and then the director's got one day in which to shoot it. (05:21) And suddenly I understood why sometimes the directors had rushed through things I thought was important or been happy when they got it. Because I was always saying, oh, let's have another go, let's try it another way. - I'd only give one piece of advice to anyone marrying: try and marry someone kind. (05:39) - The original inspiration for \\"About Time\\" is the scene that most people talk to me about, which is the scene on a beach, when the leading character travels back to just spend an afternoon with his dad who's just died. And, almost for the first time in the movies, the idea I had was based on a visual thing. (05:58) And I remember starting now, at last, as a writer, to start to sort of think, well, what really matters about that scene isn't so much all the words that they're saying, but where they're standing, that it's a lonely street. So I think, at last, by \\"About Time\\" I was gaining a bit of visual confidence. (06:17) And I hired the cameraman from my favorite visual movie, called \\"Like Crazy,\\" that Drake Doremus made. And I started to think, if you want to fall in love with a character, then the words can do two-thirds of it, but if you can shoot it well, then maybe that's gonna be the thing which, as it were, goes into your heart without knowing how it got there. (06:42) ♪ Oh, I believe in yesterday ♪ - Oh my, when did you write that? - I didn't write it; Paul McCartney wrote it, the Beatles. - Who? - I mean I've been obsessed by the Beatles for the whole of my life. That's the real inspiration. But then, of course, the inspiration that the Beatles gave me was that a lot of their stuff was about love. (07:08) We got permission, fabulously, to use, I think, 18 Beatles' songs, and they didn't say which. It was a wonderful thing to write, because I'd be typing along and think, okay, he's having a crisis. And then I'd go through the Beatles catalog and think, well, \\"Help\\" is clearly, if he's gonna sing any song now, it should be \\"Help. (07:26) \\" It was a wonderful thing 'cause they've got such a range that, as I told this tale, there was always a perfect Beatles' song to go in. I think that the curve of my career is to realize that love doesn't end at the first kiss or as you walk down the aisle in wedding. That's where some of my movies did end. (07:46) When I went to \\"Love Actually,\\" which had brothers and sisters, and fathers and sons, and married couples. And then, \\"About Time\\" was a romantic comedy for half of it and then a film about death and family and marriage. And that \\"Yesterday\\" is a movie about love of music and love. (08:03) I think I've learned that love's a big subject that the traditional shape of a rom-com doesn't quite cover.” Video: \\"When I write about love I'm accused of being untrue\\" | Richard Curtis |

philanthropy and I'm so pleased to be here with Richard today so Richard I was gonna wear those shoes for you yeah I'm sorry I didn't well I'm not sure where to go with that but so Richard as we saw from the introduction you are known in your creative world in for capturing in one scenes sort of the whole zeitgeist er essence of a film as we saw with I'm just a girl so translating that over to your work with the global goals how would you what's that scene how would you translate for this audience the 15 year Odyssey that's been the global goals Richard Curtis: I think we would have to by the way it's very good to be here and I do get sort of nervous thinking about the potential that you all have changing the world in many ways so it's a great pleasure - real pleasure to be here I think when you're thinking about these goals which are a plan from 2015 to 2030 the the sequel as it were to the MDGs I think you're talking you talking in (01:20) terms of sort of massive endless Netflix series so as it were think of the sustainable development goals as the game of Thrones there are some there are some there are some baddies who will you know get elected and then over the time people who you don't think are gonna be very powerful and strong will grow to huge strength and take on power and new alliances will be forged I mean it's a decade of delivery that we're now looking for it's 11 years so I think it's not one line it's like every (02:00) person in a room like this thinking well where does my particular power lie outside just the work that I do in order to try and sort of change up the world then a very interesting fact the other day that just about the importance of a sort of interrelationship between business and and the goals that someone said to me that if temperature were to rise by 4% the insurance industry would cease existing there could be no more insurance because they're all insurance companies would go bankrupt with the extent that they had to pay back things (02:38) so the interrelationship between climate and business and sustainability is so crucial Interviewer: well the idea behind the goals are so brilliant right it's it's hey let's do this together let's set our ambition our strategy our objectives as a global human family and they're ambitious around poverty and climate change and health but they can also feel overwhelming and challenging and a bit hopeless sometimes so how do you stay optimistic as you as you're thinking about rallying the world rallying all of (03:14) us to take on these these goals Richard Curtis: well I don't I mean I don't know how much all of you know about the goals they were negotiated in after a loan negotiation by a hundred and ninety three countries there are seventeen of them I think they break down into 169 targets and the idea behind them was to be comprehensive you know I think that one of the things that is sometimes hard for all of us is you say well I'm gonna really commit to this issue you know I'm gonna support Amnesty International or I'm going to worry (03:47) about plastic in the oceans and everything you think well while I'm committing to that one should I be committing to other things and to you know is is am I in conflict with people who believe those when we did the Make Poverty History campaign which led to Live Aid there was an extraordinary moment when climate stormed out of the room I remember he was wearing shorts and carrying a bicycle and we just decided it was too complicated a mixture of things to deal with and the point about these goals is they really do say (04:20) that everything is interdependent and that actually extreme poverty is a massive Vishu in terms of climate and that injustice will also lead to extreme poverty so that all of those things are tied together so I think the idea really is that it does give it's really useful to have a big plan I mean all of you run companies you have a very very complex agenda towards absolutely everything that you do you're used to complexity and the idea that you could solve the problems of the world by sort of three simple nice phrases would be ridiculous (04:54) so the goals do actually give you an opportunity to put everything next to everything so that you actually can align the policies of a government or the policies of a business next to it and see really how you're doing and I think that makes us feel very safe and very you know United Interviewer: but do you ever do you ever feel that the challenges are just you know too far away and that we're not making the kind of progress that we should as a globe or do you see hope and some of the indicators that we're seeing at this point where we're (05:28) going Richard Curtis: yeah I'm naturally an optimist and I mean there are clearly a lot of very dark things in the world but that that speech you just saw President Obama say you know he said if there was one moment in the history of the world in which you would be best to be born that moment is now I saw an astonishing graphic of mortality in African countries between 1950 and 1920 20 the other day which was you know all in lines and they just went to just getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and you do see (06:12) extraordinary I mean you just have to look out for things to be optimistic about when I write my romantic films I'm sometimes accused of being sentimental and and untrue and I don't understand that at all so if someone someone makes a film about a serial killer they've only ever been four of them and it's called a you know searingly realistic portrait the problems facing modern society and I write a film about love and probably at least 60% of you are in love with someone at the moment and there are 7 (06:50) million people in love in London then for some reason it's called sentimental and unrealistic and untrue and I think that it just depends which way you know which way you look and my experience when I started comic relief you know I was depending on comedians many of the least nice people in the world and certainly were those selfish and I was saying to them will you do what you can for charity and we've raised whatever it is 1. (07:20) 3 billion and and and the what's happening in terms of diseases is extraordinary and I remember I wrote a film about malaria and I had a very angry phone call from the director of it saying and it took a while to make an effort and he said you haven't even checked your facts he said you know there's only 250,000 children died of malaria this year not as I had in the script five hundred thousand and it was because in the four years since I'd originally written it the number had gone down so dramatically I said to you by the way this is good news I said no (07:53) if I'm about 5 million accurate writing that's good news but I do look around me and I think that I mean you must all feel that there is power and technology to do bad but astonishing power and technology to do good there's you know terrible worries about climate change but an astonishingly empowered younger generation that has suddenly started to get the message it tremendous questions of you know inequality in terms but you know particularly of men and women but you know we are also the me two (08:28) generation things ignite things change so I think you have to sign off and say you know cynics knows days never made any money yet not a single dollar and I think that if you're optimistic and if you view the things that are working and I think then the goals provides a plan for that there is no reason not to think that you can't change the world magnificently Interviewer: well you have been obviously so successful in getting your films out globally people know and love them everywhere as you think about this part of your life where you're trying to get (09:04) the world the globe to know about and think about and care about the global close how do you think you know what's the best way to do that how do you inspire people to to be involved and reach people Richard Curtis: well I mean I've taken rather a sort of when you make films the people you hate most of the people you make the posters from the trailers particularly the posters and ghastly retouched photograph poster makers probably probably not even with your stars actual bottom probably somebody else's bottom of the photograph and then (09:43) and then you know a line you didn't write so this whole thing that you've made that you've put so much effort into well I'm the poster guy for the goals I'm trying to make them we came up with this graphic we're trying to make them simple we argued about you know trying to keep the names of them short and I'm just trying to get the word out there because what you want is that when people you know go to their employees and say let's do something about the goals you want them to have just glimpse (10:12) them come across them in some way when you make a film there's a big tradition now of you know trying to sort of get some shot of the making of the film into the newspapers so that when people see the poster it's the second time they've heard about it and when they see the trailer it's the third time and then they may be tempted to go to see the film so what we're trying to do is to spread the word in as many ways as we can through pop music through concerts through graphics through this thing we (10:41) could do called the world's largest lessons through partnership through businesses you know to try and get the idea of them out there so that when people actually you know in companies and in politics focus on them they believe that it's something that the public will endorse and possibly feel passionate about Interviewer: And one of the things that we've chatted about backstage is just you know the role of Technology so how are you seeing technology advancing and being able to help us to get get to these goals Richard Curtis: I think you probably I mean I (11:17) think that you know there's an enormous amount that technology can do I mean well I'm really you know you do look for technology just have some of the you know actual answers but certainly we have never been in a world where there's more possibility for a message going virally and hugely and then once you get that message as it were being able to press on the button of each of these and see what are the things that you can do because by the way I'm a huge believer that we can do things individually in (11:51) our lives and I think that is a very good way of as it were starting with meatless Monday and giving Tuesday and change your pension scheme Wednesday and what but no but tell me Jacqueline what's your sense about what Google could do and what technology can do for the goals because that's the world in which as it were my kids are living and most people are referring to that for their information in their… Interviewer: well you know I think like you were saying we've we've seen great progress and in some ways you know we've we've have (12:26) child poverty and great advances in health but the rest of the gap is really gonna take new solutions and I think that's where technology especially AI can be really helpful we just you know at Google we've been trying to think about how can we inspire the world especially young technologists people who are researching nonprofits social businesses to align their work with with the global goals and so one of the things that we did is we we actually launched a competition this last year an open call where we put out 25 million (13:00) dollars in a pool of funding and then expertise from our AI professionals and then said okay right tell us your idea align it with the global goals tell us how you're going to use AI and the winners which we just you know they're doing incredible work for example a team in Africa in Uganda is using really low-cost sensors that they're putting on the backs of motorcycle taxis and they're using that to map and track air pollution which is one of the silent killers and then using that to measure what's being effective (13:35) in fighting that air pollution a team in India for example is using AI to help diagnose what the the pests and the diseases are that subsistence farmers are facing and then put the right pesticide against that and that's gonna help not only the farmers to earn more income but it's going to help reduce pesticide use which is gonna help the environment that's also frontiere was one of our winners here in europe and they're doing amazing work on antibiotic resistance so they have a smartphone app (14:04) that an untrained community worker in the field could use in a low resource environment to read whether the bacteria that someone has is resistant that way they're gonna do better health for the individual but they're also going to help the globe with this kind of resistance so there's all sorts of ideas many of them being led out at the global South on how we can apply AI so we we are just trying to think about how can we seed and support inspire those kinds of technologies so we also published (14:38) some research on our site you know a lot of people think AI is just sort of magic pixie dust and don'tyou know they know it's super powerful and has so many opportunities but don't know exactly how that could apply to their cause the issue that they care about so we published some research on our site a eyes for social impact people and you can see there how what are all the AI technologies that are showing the most promise for each of the global goals so I think this kind of building the ecosystem and and building up partners (15:09) who are working on this issue is is the way that we're gonna get technology to help us accelerate and close that gap Richard Curtis: well that’s so exciting to me I do think that this idea that we may have a generation now and I hope it applies to everyone here that thinks what is my work for if it's not for tried to make the world better I believe that they be making this up Paul Palmer told me that they they did two ads for the same job at Unilever and they tested one which stressed what Unilever does for the world and it's sort of sustainable commitments and (15:48) the other one that stretched the perks and the wages and many many more people applied through the ad on the sustainability and what they do and I think the idea that you can point a generation in the direction of thinking that it's a both/and you don't need to say well I'm either gonna make a lot of money and sell my patent for millions or I'm gonna change the world you can make yes okay yes it changes the world and then you can also make a lot of money Interviewer: Well I think you're right that many (16:18) people are motivated and many people just want to know what can I do so what would you say Richard to this audience if they want to get behind the global goals and help with the work that you're doing Richard Curtis: Well I mean I think there there is an enormous number of things that you can do one just in your own lives as I was saying think about the things which could make a difference I'm really finding that helpful I will now buy an electric car because I just think that it's important to know that in the (16:48) texture of your own lives you're actually doing the things that you're meant to do because that's what you know and then inspires you textually I think that it is really it would be brilliant to communicate something about the goals to your employees because I do think this is a sort of bounce thing the moment that you say to the people who work for you we're interested in these things have a look at them check them out yourselves and then as it were counter check with us I think that you will find an amazingly interesting (17:21) dialogue between you on all the areas of your behavior on your supply chains on you know gender equality on how you're affecting the environment I think that would be an amazingly helpful dialogue check your pension fund I think this is a really interesting idea you know someone said to me the other day they're like a third of the world's money's owned by governments a third of it's owned by rich people and a third of it's owned by us as it were you know we the way that we're gonna get (17:50) more investment in all the extraordinary projects like the ones that you're describing is by pension funds and investment investing increasingly and sustainability and an impact and in those things that will change the world and I would love the feeling that when you start to talk to your employees they will say well how's our pension fund invested where's our money going and that will increasingly go into all the best projects that they can do and that some of those projects will of course be things that you yourselves are working (18:20) on now so I think it's just to introduce it into the environment of the place that you work and then really check out whether or not the things that you do are in accordance with it it'll be helpful if it hadn't been for the ten commandments I would have been committing adultery and murdering people every day of the week but I was definitely so so I just think that it's a really useful purpose and plan and if you don't know them this is the time by the way because in 2005 when we did the (18:57) Make Poverty History campaign Live Aid I couldn't the meetings with people in business were so ghastly they really just thought this is a bunch of dangerous lefties who want to give away all their money and now business as you know as there were you talking about the things that you're backing they're actually ahead they're the ones you've seen that there's a whatever business from betterworld said twelve trillion advantage in actually working for an investing of the goals people can (19:26) see that that's the way that business should go so this is exactly the moment and if we can create a dialogue between business and government because governments much prefer talking to businesses than they do talking to charities they hate charity people they always just go on repeating themselves but if you can start a dialogue 2020 is the moment to kind of start the second phase of the and so anything that any of you can do and what to have a conversation without some project everyone you know would be (19:55) dreaming.” Video: Richard Curtis | Wiki4All – YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5gMq1nmjBE

Video: \\"Richard Curtis And His Very Limited Experience Of Life\\" - Notting Hill Screenwriter Criticised - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVQnQC8vGdo Transcript: (00:00) well comedian Ria Lena joins us in the studio now Ria what do you reckon um do you reckon that that the Richard Curtis should be regretting these jokes that he's made in the past or do do you think he's learned his lesson do you know I think it is about whether he should or he shouldn't I think it's the fact that he is he is looking back and he is seeing in his old work through current eyes and I think there's a lot of people that agree with him are they looking at their work through current eyes um and (00:27) regretting what they did is there not just an acknowledgement that really the world's changed I mean this is a really inter my gosh that is the most leftwing question you've ever asked I've been watch for a while I'm being serious I know the world's changed but you can't apologize for everything listen to this this is interesting Tina we've got loads of respon to this section there was no one more loved or more relevant than Robin Williams nothing was off limits he was comedic genius that's why we loved (00:51) him he must be turning in his grave to see what's happening to Comedy now because they look back the whole time I think it's a very relevant point I and I'm trying to think of of something that Robin Williams said that that in any way was was offensive he did Cover a wide range of topics he wore a fat suit for Mrs dfire was that disrespectful no that was Mrs Doubtfire he was pretending to be a Scottish nanny I don't are we implying that all Scottish nannies are we didn't have enough time in this (01:17) segment to discuss Mrs delire what a film in itself uh but well the thing is is that if you want to be successful you're going to want to make most of the people laugh most of the time all right nobody's really said that anything's per se of limits but it might limit who's going to enjoy your artwork so Ava Santina and I were talking about this earlier in our pay-per review uh the fat jokes that he would make about Bridget Jones uh and about Marty McCutchen's character in Love Actually where car (01:46) another character called her the chubby one which she wasn't at all we were led to believe at me as a young girl that Bridget Jones was overweight or even fat and I look at her now with Modern Eyes and go she hardly had on it no but I think a film but part of that part of that was the fact that the actress are suffer El wagger it was a whole publicity compan how much weight she had to put on for it because they didn't even cast somebody you know that that would fit that would fit that role I think the Bridget Jones thing is (02:19) interesting I don't think that I mean yes there were a lot of fat jokes but what I think that was if you look at the original Helen Fielding books you know he didn't completely rewrite the books this was a character that was sad to be single she was obsessed about her weight uh I think the issue was is that it was it was screen written by a straight white male instead of perhaps a woman that could understand exactly what Helen Fielding was getting at with that character and then just portray that the (02:43) way that we women would understand give you Steven both of you understood this it's ridiculous apologizing for a joke written 30 years ago if it was funny then in my mind it's funny now I'm sick of being expected to accept that everything I've ever learned loved and laughed at is wrong it is not wrong simply a reflection of my life and time no I'm sorry about the reflection of your life and time Stephen but but he has a right to that opinion and I have a right to have an opinion on his opinion (03:07) um so when we move to the the the topic of minorities in Richard Curtis films there's no doubt you watch Notting Hill there's not a single black character in it you watch Love Actually there are very few black characters in it and that's you know London in the naughties OR Notting Hill in the '90s OR that's Richard Curtis and his very limited experience of life he said himself he went to her and then he went to Oxford and he never looked outside of that and that really is a question about who are (03:35) we allowing to write art and who are we turning to and that is you know brings us on to the diversity question I know a lot of people going why do we have so much diversity so that we can have a wider range of authentic artwork put in front of us comedy or otherwise in terms of what's on or off limits I mean we we cover all things in drama all things are covered what what why you're you're she got a lovely Tour on rear Awakening I get that to 2023

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4XaYbQlKxI Transcript: Richard Curtis: (00:04) hello my name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> and this is apparently my career in four minutes [extract from a movie] my dear son this is going to sound strange but there's this secret but the men in this family can travel in time Richard Curtis: Wow I mean I think of anything the secret of my films has been alive still tried to keep writing sketches and many of them if you look at “Four Weddings” it's it's in a funny way sketch movie really this these two jokes of this wedding these two jokes of the next wedding and if you look at “Notting Hill” (00:36) those seen when in the junket where is being interviewed that's like a sketch about somebody misunderstanding a film or not have you seen a film so I think they're sketch writing definitely informed and was crucial to the movie career I think the magic of sitcom is probably still writing sketches in sitcom but the plot structure of sitcom which is so crucial I don't think resembles the structure of movies very much so I think this it's harder to see the line between the sitcoms and the films. “The Tall Guy” was a very happy (01:07) film Jeff gobble a very funny man and I particularly remember just roaring with laughter in a scene where Rowan was having a party when he'd sacked Jeff go from and he for the party just bought a mini bottle of champagne because at the end of my tour with Roman we did 72 dates and Roland had a party and he bought one bottle of champagne and one pizza not one pizza for all of us one pizza so I remember having a very good time on that the successful forwards and femur was a complete surprise to everybody I got a piece of paper from (01:43) MGM or whoever owned the movie and Paula Graham who at the movie and next to America of the expected earnings that said naught so it was a great shock to everybody the strange thing was I remember thinking of the plot of Notting Hill on a very wet afternoon sitting in a waiting room with corin redgrave who played and in the dalles husband and James fleet on for wedding so I actually thought of knotting here while we were making for wedding so it was lucky for me that that coming out of the success of for weddings I already knew what I (02:19) was going to do rather than thinking oh god what's next the thing about Love Actually is it was a curious film because everybody was only on it for a week or for two weeks so that nobody could see quite how bad I was about it because just when they were thinking of my god really doesn't know what he's doing they were off so it was it was it was it was nerve-racking but it was like I could start 12 times you know every time we've got a new bunch I would be a little bit better one of the reasons I (02:46) wrote that film was because there's a whole chunk of it was particularly the Robert Altman ones but I love Nashville as a movie called smooth and I love they loved pulp fiction so there were a lot of a multi-storey for shortcuts it was a genre i love the strange thing about the cast of the boat rocked as they were almost all in every single scene so that was when i started directing just with the camera on people's shoulders so that instead of saying a single of him a secured him a single of helena chemicals (03:16) go like that and find whoever was talking I think what I learned was the sort of negative lesson which is that I didn't like the formal structures moving making I did not like doing the wide shot followed by a two-shot follow back because he just get locked in at the beginning of the day into one performance and one geography so I think that I in this in the boat the rod and now in about time the cameras very fluid and flexible and just waiting to catch good things rather you know being part of a verse of a (03:43) formal shooting straight working with earl morris with students berber was absolute joy because steven is a sultan it really is storytelling genius so you would come up with a scene and he would say what that sounds great how about this and suddenly he would imagine 10 minutes of cinema that you can completely see if you said well I'm not sure that's right because this character wouldn't do that he'd imagined another whole 10 minutes of cinema I mean he was fantastic like someone who could go on (04:09) writing brilliant Tunes one after anot her well it's funny I have already written to time travel thing said there was time traveling in a black and a special that we do and I did a doctor who which was fun time traveling back to him Vincent van Gogh so I obviously am interested in it I didn't research time travel movies before I made my wanted to go back and watch I mean at the moment I'm not intending to direct something again the moment the message of about time is just do stress do less stressful (04:40) things and enjoy yourself and so the next time i work with bill will be working on a walking holiday rather than a movie.” Video: Richard Curtis and His Start with Four Weddings and a Funeral - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YutcjLfHVRI Transcript: (00:04) Interviewer: the film that we first got to know you with As Americans uh was “Four Weddings and a funeral” was it the first film you wrote Richard Curtis: second I wrote a film called “The Tall Guy” which was Emma Thompson's Emma Thompson and Jeff Goldblum MH that that smatter is an exact proportional representation um of how much money that movie made in comparison to Four Weddings Interviewer: okay so “four weddings and a funeral” um introdu gave us Hugh Grant in America that's sort of what all sold us on Hugh Grant um would you like to apologize to anyone right now Richard Curtis: (00:39) the answer the official answer is only to Divine Brown isn't it that's the that's the official answer to the question but no no I mean I didn't I tried not to allow Hugh to audition because I thought he was too handsome and I thought it would… Interviewer: he wasn't he wasn't you didn't think he was right for that part Richard Curtis: no no and in fact in the end were me the director and the producer and it came down to choosing between Hugh and Alan Rickman and I voted for Alan wow so I I I was so wrong um but would have been a very (01:14) different part yeah and the thing is I'd imagined it like breaking away in a film called Gregory's girl a very great English movie where uh I thought that that the the guy had to be not attractive particularly that had to be the explanation and then he found true love I didn't realize that by making him attractive it would make the film sort of three times as successful but Hugh was uh Hugh was the only but Hugh was the only person who could do the lines of all the 70 people we auditioned and he was extraordinarily on point he was (01:47) completely accurate he he did everything as exactly as I'd dreamt it I was I was very lucky.” Video: ‘Love Actually’ writer Richard Curtis on film’s legacy - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNspva0W3xY Transcript: Interviewer: (00:00) 20 years Richard Curtis: yeah I know I think the 20 years shows what a youthful optimist I probably was when I wrote it Interviewer: he says he still wants to write about our Humanity the surprising ways we are good to each other in a world that has so many movies filled with trauma and violence Richard Curtis: we get thousands of films about serial killers and there's only ever been about nine of them and yeah there'll be a million people falling in love feeling it's the most interesting moment of their lives Good Deeds inside families and Good Deeds inside (00:38) communities if you look at what happened during covid and the extraordinary sort of bravery and heroism I do think the way to think about life is that every day has the potential in all its Simplicity just to be just to be gorgeous.” Video: (1) Richard Curtis explains why he likes to set his films in Britain - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCvBZnc_Wbg Transcript: (00:03) and I wrote the script and it was set in Boston and I went to see the people at MGM and they said this is amazing this is a fantastic script I said oh I'm so thrilled and they said except the two leading characters we don't like I said why and they said well it's sort of weak no one's gonna admire them we'll want to spend time with them I said no and they said the dialogues very English it doesn't really read American so you'll have to work on that and I said oh right and then they said which means that most (00:38) of the jokes don't work because people won't get their humor so I said that only needs the title that's the only thing we've got and they said we hate the time and I I flew home two weeks later and I swore I'll never do a film that's not set actually where I live.

Person 5: all his work is as seamless thing that the Vicar of Dibley and Blackadder and Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a (01:00) funeral and comic relief and Love Actually and Make Poverty History are all part of who he is as a man and also as this incredibly talented writer and creative artist Person 6: well he's an enigma and rather like the character of Charles and Four Weddings when I was sent that script I never really understood the character because I thought no one in England is both funny and nice you know you can't or not the sort of a servic and nice but Richard does bring off that strange balancing act Person 7: no I think what he he's a master of is the apparent (01:35) inability of people to communicate certainly that was true of the character I played in Love Actually and I think it's very true of the character that Hugh Grant plays in Notting Hill Person 1: Richard’s funniest lines are undoubtedly Hugh Grant's lines which are always ““t…th…er…d…um..t..th…s..er…” Person 7: what's actually happening is that he's expressing something very very precisely in this apparent breakdown of language in this district Person 1: ““t…th…er…d…um..t..th…s..er…” I love those Person 2: the trademarks I suppose of a Richard Curtis script apart from the fact that it will always be intelligent clever and (02:28) purposeful is the fact that every minute and a half or so he'll deliver a world-class joke Person 5: the thing that marks our Richards work from it everyone else's is that it's a seamless part of who he is as a person and so that he didn't write Love Actually in order to make a crowd-pleasing film he wrote it because that's his philosophy of life Person 6: basically yeah I'm afraid to say he actually does quite like people you know he's the exact that's what makes it makes me laugh that I play these (03:00) characters which are basically him in his films because he is basically nice and full of benevolence and I am basically nasty and full of hatred Person 7: if one is right in thinking that Richards view of the world is very focused on love as a force in common with all humanity and love and all its difficulties in that it's the thing that somehow drives us all which is the thesis of Love Actually I think that does lie at the root of his work for Africa Person 8: I mean we all saw the Michael Burke films from that came out of (03:35) Ethiopia but instigated live oh but we should actually went on his own money to go and look and to see what he could do to help Person 9: he invented Red Nose Day I mean it's not given to many people who invent a day there's a man Jesus I'm not sure how many others I can name Person 3: the Red Nosed they affect is extraordinary the level of knowledge about issues around poverty is so high in Britain compared to the rest of Europe or America Person 8: is immensely generous with his time you know when it's a comic relief here he'll give up (04:05) six months of his life sometimes twelve eighteen months to make sure something will happen properly Person 4: couple of years before the Gleneagles g8 summit we were in desperate need of the best storyteller we could find to communicate these rather dull issues of debt and trade to the British public so he asked Richard to take a year off and make poverty history Person 7: looking back at the Live 8 (concerts) I think it's quite remarkable that his efforts together with Bob Geldof got people talking in a way that had never happened before never would (04:39) have been possible Person 2: “The Girl In the Café” was a great opportunity for me and it was something that I'm extremely proud to have been associated with it's a perfect amount of of entertainment and information and it made a big impact all over the world particularly in America where it was extremely well received Person 3: his work with Comic Relief and Make Poverty History is responsible for saving the lives literally countless mothers daughters fathers and sons across the world Person 7: when looking at what he's achieved I think (05:14) it's very very important to remember that he is also very largely responsible for Hugh Grant and I think that has to be taken into consideration when looking at the good side of Richard Person 4: Richard congratulations mate you're an absolute national treasure Person 1: I think it's very important that Richard Curtis should own this fellowship because otherwise how will he return the ring to Mordor Video: Richard Curtis, What's Funny? | MontclairFilm – YouTube https://youtu.be/-UqyVPGVM_8?list=LL Transcript: Interviewer: I understand, and tell me if I got this right, is that when you first started writing a wrote for the BBC, and that you were given a list of things that were funny. Richard Curtis: Yes, that's absolutely right, yeah. Interviewer: Okay, that's a difference between American comedy and British comedy. No one gives us a list of things that were funny when we started writing job. What was this list? The government had officially determined. Richard Curtis: No. I didn't like that list, but they were, and they were in a funny way, summed up by Cambridge, an Oxford when I was there. Cambridge had a real sort of system. You've probably heard of the Cambridge Footlights, and you kind of auditioned for it. They had a show up in Edinburgh. So they'd almost sort of math and math-ish-sized comedy. Time you saw a sketch of theirs. You thought, oh, that's very highly wrought and very clever, but there was very little humanity in it. And actually, you see a lot of that in Monty-Python. Not that much humanity. And that had sort of crept into the BBC. And so when you went there, they said, well, we're doing a satirical program, and the funny things are trade unions, British rail sandwiches. You know, the chancellor's eyebrows. And I thought the funny things were someone who's a bit uneasy with the person sending next door to them, because they're taller than they are. Do I mean, everything I thought was funny, was to do with human beings interacting, and nothing to do with politics and preconceptions. So that was the reason I failed failed so badly on weak ending the satirical radiation.

Richard Curtis: nobody knows I don't even I don't know I can't remember I can't remember how it's done that's the strange thing is it is a sort of organic organic process so one of the things is to make sure that you really do believe in the story that it keeps coming back to you so that as it (00:35) were there's a purpose to it I then I mean I used to be the most ill-disciplined writer I would get up at one watch some television have some tea make some phone calls have some dinner big oh I should probably start now but since I've had kids and a family I actually do try and go to a quiet place and write a lot Interviewer: have you had a favorite character? Richard Curtis: I'd I liked the stupid ones I like the stupid characters so there was baldrick and Blackadder and Emma chambers in The Vicar of Dibley and Rhys Ifans and Notting Hill it's just so nice (01:14) to have someone who gets a laugh Interviewer: and any advice for young screenwriters of today Richard? Richard Curtis: my advice is to work with people you genuinely admire I think that it can be a real mistake and this goes back to what you know we're doing here which is you find the people who are passionate and you work with them and you find the companies who are passionate the politicians who are passionate and I think sometimes young writers will make a mistake of saying well this is a famous name if that person wants to make my film that would be fantastic and (01:53) that's a famous actor and if they want to be in my film that's fantastic but if you don't like that directors work and if that actor is not the right actor for the part it will the whole thing won’t you know won't work so I think trying to keep your sense of integrity even in the face of more shiny objects Video: Exclusive Insight from Rowan Atkinson & Co-Creator & Writer, Richard Curtis | Happy Birthday Mr Bean - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt8agz7jipY Transcript: Person 1: (00:06) what was usually funny was just the process of of how he gets out of a difficult situation or how he gets into a difficult situation [Extract from Mr Bean] Charcter 1: done your revision? Bean: oh yes i've concentrated on trigonometry Character 1: i've done calculus mainly Bean: i believe they concentrated on calculus last year Character 1: oh dear Character 2: quiet ladies and gentlemen please the exam starts now [end of extraction] Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson): bodily expression particularly with mr bean is so very very important it's sort of screaming at you you know there may be no words but you're being shouted at i think very loudly by the (00:59) bodily expression the word compelling is quite good because i think that's what draws you into a lot of mr bean sketches Richard Curtis: you only have to have the starting point of the idea he gets locked out of his room or he's going to a swimming pool or something like that and then you could be pretty confident that we would be able to to make it work [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: with those who answer the green calculus papers please put them in the green box and those who answer the white trigonometry papers please put them in the white box [End of extract] Richard Curtis: what i've always done on the mr beans is (02:09) it where i've done the charcoal outline and then rowan adds all the color and the texture and i laughed at him while he's doing it [Extract from Mr Bean] Character 2: i said stop writing will you stop writing Narrator: it is 30 years since the first mr bean was shown on british television and it became an instant hit between 1990 and 1995 the team went on to produce 14 episodes in total Person 3 (Sir Tony Robinson): i didn't know until this moment there were only 14. (02:49) i thought there were probably 114 and that roman had been coining in for years and years making this never-ending flow of mr beans Person 2 (Rowan Atkinson) : we did the other 14 episodes in drips and drabs we didn't make 14 at once we made two and then we made three more and then we made one one and we made four more and eventually we got to this rather poultry sum of 14. (03:16) they were always given a sort of prime spot and and they keep that and suddenly you know people realize that visual comedy could actually hold a large audience Narator: after the overnight success of episode 1 the team was in need of new material and comedy writer robin driscoll was hired he would also feature in various sketches as a straight man to rowan Richard Curtis: i would say in the story of mr bean it's rowan, robin, and then possibly me i was thinking away rowan and i did the obvious ones we got the low hanging fruit and what was brilliant about robin (04:08) is that he's just kept as it were squeezing the lemon finding new things finding different ways taking a little thread be it to do with the car or with the teddy or anything like that. Video: Richard Curtis | BAFTA Screenwriters' Lecture Series - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMcXrAPmchk Transcript: Video: Richard Curtis Talks ABOUT TIME with AMC - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQJK3xXDrc Transcript: Interviewer: (00:05) so now you came up with this premise over a pretty simple conversation right about what you would do with the last 24 hours liv Richard Curtis: yeah actually i i came up with the idea that i wanted to write a film about how to be happy and about appreciating a normal day that actually your happiest day wouldn't be some exotic day in las vegas with winning a million dollars and hearing you'd be nominated for an oscar that'd be tense and nervous but uh the idea my first idea was in fact to write a really simple film about (00:35) a normal day and then i thought that'll be dull so i then thought i'll write a huge science fiction time travel movie where the person finally decides that all he would do with this gift is simply lead a normal day and travel back to the beginning of each day and just live it again and enjoy it Interviewer: and i felt like you really wrote that in bill nye's character out of all of them because you know even with this gift it kind of goes back to that simplicity of just the beauty of our everyday life Richard Curtis: right yeah that's so true and bill and I (01:06) talk about this a lot now i mean i think we're we're both saying to each other are you sticking to the moral of the movie we're trying to make sure we're holding to it because both of us feel as though we should you know be more happy just with the normal day and not worry so much Interviewer: so what i love so much about your films is that all these characters they're witty and intelligent but very very relatable i feel like we can all relate to at least one of them and the same goes with gleason and mcadams characters (01:35) their chemistry on screen was amazing what was it like watching you know these characters come alive in the two of them again with chemistry that can't be taught it's there or it's not Richard Curtis: no it's so interesting i'm not i i until my films are well cast they're no good at all it would you would be interested how in the casting sessions i just lose confidence with every single person who comes in and it's only when you actually get the perfect person like as there were love in life suddenly when donald came in for the (02:04) first time the part was funny and i think that you tend to cast people who kind of appeal to your heart and then once you've done that they are likely to have some chemistry they are likely to get on with each other you know i could tell that both donal and rachel were basically sweet people with a naughty twinkle and i think that's why they got on so well Interviewer: i like that naughty twinkle so out of all the amazing characters that you have created and there are so many of them who do you think from a past film would (02:35) have been a good addition in this film Richard Curtis: oh what an interesting question um i don't know if you i mean that's an interesting question because spike you remember who Hugh lived with in notting hill if you see course very bad he wouldn't have fitted into this movie at all but there was a character in “four weddings” a very sweet character played by james fleet who was the not very clever posh rich friend yeah i can imagine him fitting into this movie and then Bill's character in love actually could just have been on the (03:06) telly because i think it's ten years since the movie came out and i'm sure he would be re-releasing the movie the dodgy song for christmas to try and make a few extra Interview: i think you should throw him in every movie that character the rock star Richard Curtis: on the radio Interviewer: yes so why do you think amc theater audiences and audiences everywhere are going to love this movie Richard Curtis: i hope that they will get slightly more than they bargained for i mean i it is quite a romantic film but i hope there are lots of jokes in it there actually (03:34) is some time travel and some of the normal chaos that time travel chooses and then i think in the end the movie turns out to be a little bit more emotional than expected i've known a lot of people who say that the moment they walked out they rang their dad or ran their son so i hope it'll be a movie that actually leaves something in your mind when you've seen. Video: Richard Curtis Interview: Love, Actually, Genie, Notting Hill, and Pirate Radio | Collider Interviews – YouTube https://youtu.be/8DSE5a0Xvyc Transcript: When I spoke to you for yesterday, you told me you had a five-hour cut of Pirate Radio. My question is, when can I see it? You can never see it. No one will ever see it. But it's a funny thing with Pirate Radio. Now I think about it, I think if I'd written it now, I would have done it as a TV series. Actually, it was very kind of episodic, and we should have done one where they raid another boat, one where they start to drown, one where the electricity goes down. But it was fun at five hours, but I don't think for human consumption. Well, you never know. I mean, Baz just released his Australia cut on Hulu as a miniseries. So maybe you want to revisit that as a... Anyway, that's just a hypothetical. So I read a few years ago that Hugh Grant revealed Notting Hill was maybe based on a friend of yours. And I wanted to know if it's possibly time for the truth to come out. No. I wouldn't go to Hugh Grant for the truth, if you're searching for it. It was really based on a kind of fantasy I used to have. I used to go for dinner every week with the same people and have the same conversation. And I remember when I was an obsessive Madonna fan, I thought... what would it be like if at last I managed to walk in with with a woman instead of just on my own with a warm bottle of white wine and kind of so the movie started with that kind of dream scenario of what would it be like if you could and you know I was thinking about Madonna and one of my friends at that dinner was an obsessive Madonna fan and the other one would definitely never have heard of her so it was based on a on a dream rather than on a on a fact. So it's the 20th anniversary of Love Actually and it's now become a Christmas classic you know people love the movie I love the movie and if it comes on it means I have to keep watching. When did you realize wait a minute this film has become something special to a lot of people? It was it was when I started getting texts from people I didn't know very well saying we're watching it again you know it was it did take a while and it's still a bit of a mystery to me I mean I've got a theory I think the reason people watch it again is they can never remember what's going to happen next you know normally when you watch a movie you know they've robbed the bank they're going to get in the car drive away and then they're going to get shot by the police whereas even I when I watch Love Actually don't have any idea what the next scene is so I think it kind of it's bearable to watch it again because it's always surprising you but you know it's a once in a lifetime bit of luck when you make something particularly Christmas. I used to so love watching Charlie Brown's Christmas every Christmas and White Christmas every Christmas. So I'm, it's a real little, it's a real little boost for me. Did you ever think the Andrew Lincoln storyline might be a little too weird? I am very often told it's a little too weird. It didn't occur to me at the time, but you know times change. And I remember someone once saying they would like to interview me about it and they would be focusing on the stalking scene. And I said, \\"Oh, I didn't know there was a stalking scene.\\" And they said, \\"Yeah, yeah, no, you know, the Andrew Lincoln, that's like top notch stalking.\\" So, you know, slowly but surely I've realized what a dreadful mistake I made. I don't think it's a mistake as much as, you know, it's a little different than the rest. But anyway, there's a new 4K release that's about to come out. What are you actually most excited for people to see on it? Well, it is very pretty now. I mean, it is interesting. You know, one of the things I do like about Love Actually is I love how kind of it looks. I think actually the kind of texture of it is very, has a sort of magic to it. And we've really added to that. The 4K, you know, where there were fuzzes in the background, you can see chandeliers and candles and everything like that. So I think it's just a sort of general feeling that the movie somehow got. a little bit better, that it's even more cheerful than it was before. That, so the grade is really lovely and then we've also remixed it and that's fun as well because, you know, technical things do improve as time goes by. If you can imagine watching a brighter version of White Christmas, what joy that would be. You've directed, you've written a lot, but you've only directed a few things. Do you have plans for directing something else or you, no? No, I found directing quite tricky. And I mean, this movie is a great example. I wrote a movie set in New York, which is such a pleasure for me, but I would have felt really insecure as a non-American directing it. And also, you know, I'm getting old and Sam Boyd who directed it is not only an American, but young. So I think I'll always find someone who's better than me now. I don't necessarily better than you, I'd just say different than you. Also, I'm trying to keep my weight down. And when you direct movies, you have to eat a certain number of donuts and bacon sandwiches. And I think that's, you know, that's a heavy price to pay. I don't think people realize, actually, the one thing is there's a lot of food on movie sets, not in the UK. The UK is a little stingy, but in America, forget it. Whatever they call it, that service table. It's the most dreadful temptation. Making a movie is like going to Willy Wonka. Yes. It's just sweets everywhere. Unless you're in the UK. I've done UK set visits and you're lucky to get a cup of tea. No, it's true. American movies are better. Just on craft service. On craft service. Right, exactly. So a lot of people with Genie will not realize this is a remake of something you made many years ago. And so I'm just curious, how did it come about to remake this? Well, it's funny. Not long after I made the original movie, which is only an hour long, I thought this would have been fun as a movie movie. But time goes by, you have children and all that kind of stuff. And then just a couple of years ago, I thought I will go back and look. And my circumstances, that's about kind of a sad singleton who's just lost his girlfriend. And I thought, well, I'd love to make a movie about families on Christmas. And I can actually write a really different movie. I can set it in America. We can have a female Genie. And then, you know, the dream came true and we got Melissa. So there was just enough, you know, a lot of extra things. And then I do love Christmas movies. And if I can, you know, do another one, that makes me happy. One of the things about a film where you have a Genie and they can wish for anything is it can get expensive very fast. So how much in the writing of this, of the remake, are you thinking we can't afford that? So let me not even write it. you know, what normally happens is you write a movie and then people tell you, you can't afford it. So I don't remember thinking, I've got to, I can't do this or that. And then I think there were moments of realism, you know, we couldn't get a real cap. But I think that on the whole, my imagination is pretty modest. So most of it happens, you know, in a pretty realistic environment. And then once in a while they say, you know, change a, you know, Christmas market to, you know, a coffee stall. Sure. You have a number of references to Tom Cruise in the film. And I'm curious, did you need permission when she's wearing that shirt? Like how did that all come about? We did need permission from Tom. It was so sweet that he gave it, you know, because there's an element of teasing. I once worked, tried to do a film with Tom and he was always so delightful and friendly to me. And I don't know whether the reason he said yes is because, you know, he was so chummy then. But I love the fact that I have eventually written a Tom Cruise movie. Just so happens Tom's not in it. Exactly. But he's on the t-shirt. He's on the t-shirt and we've got like a three second clip from Mission Impossible. Yeah. When I saw that, I was like, oh, wow. I mean, you need permission for this. This is a, you know what I mean? So one of the things about this is that it's more of a family film. And I'm curious, how did the balance of that come about in terms of how much, no, actually, let me skip that question altogether. I'm fascinated by the editing process 'cause it's where it all comes together. How did this possibly change in the editing room in ways you didn't expect? Or was this all Sam and you just saw the finished film? - No, no. I mean, editing is my favorite part of the process because it's just so interesting. You write a film, it reads really well. You shoot the film, you watch it, you think it's the worst film you've ever seen. And it's really interesting. And one of the thing, you know, how you have to take out bits, change bits, stress bits. You know, one of the great things about Melissa in this is she's both magical, but very normal. And the first time I thought it, about an hour in, I thought, \\"Oh, I've forgotten she's a genie.\\" You know, she's just a lovely woman. And then you have to build up, put scenes where she does magic closer together. And then the great thing about Christmas movies is just the wealth of wonderful Christmas songs. You know, you suddenly can, if it's getting a bit weak, you throw in the OJs or Otis Redding or a bit of Anvil and suddenly the movie perks up. So, no, just like all my movies, it was a bit of a struggle. But. Particularly because the two leads, well, I say the two leads and Mark Maron and Louise Guzman, because the cast was so strong, we had very firm foundations. But as always, it was a it was a journey. What do you think would surprise soon to be fans of Genie to learn about the making of Genie? Well, I think they shouldn't be surprised that some of the funniest lines were written by Melissa McCarthy and Mark Maron. You know, I'm quite a tyrant in terms of my own lines, but these were really clever, great American comedians. And they added, you know, they added stuff in. And I think that, you know, I think everyone will perhaps be surprised how convincingly American it is. And that's because, you know, Sam's an American director. And so I hope that it feels like a Richard Curtis movie, but in a whole new in a whole new world. I am a fan of your work, have been for a very long time. I'm obviously very curious what you are working on now. Well, I'm working on buying Christmas presents and decorating the tree. You know, that's that's the big stuff. Oh, I've got a few things. I've been working on an animation, which has been a gripping process. I mean, it's the longest filmmaking in the world. But it's really interesting because you write, direct, cast, shoot and edit all at the same time. So that's been very interesting to me. And now I think I might write a play. Really? Yeah, go on. Are you writing it now, or it's... I've had a go. I've started a couple of them, so I think that might be the next thing I do. The animated thing you're talking about is called \\"That Christmas.\\" Yes. Oh, I didn't... That's my final outing to Christmas, by the way. It is? It's all going to be Easter and Midsummer's Day from now on. Sir, you have an addiction to Christmas. I'm sure that the play takes place at Christmas. No. No. There's not going to be any Christmas. I'm going to do \\"Delete All\\" on my computer whenever Christmas is mentioned again, but I'm hoping... You know, with Jeannie, I'm trying to go out with a bang. No, I think you mean \\"That Christmas,\\" you're going to go out with a bang. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm going out with a pre-bang on Jeannie. Exactly. When actually is that coming out? Do you know? Next Christmas, because Christmas takes so long. So a year from now, we will be talking again? I hope so. And you will be talking about how the play all of a sudden went to taking place at Christmas. Yeah, the play will be \\"Christmas Carol\\" by then. Right. You have actually done a tremendous amount through your career, and I am curious, if someone has never seen anything you've done before, what do you want them watching first and why? Wow. What a... Do you know, the thing I really like... Sometimes I go online and I find that somebody who isn't me has edited... like my movies down to three minutes with a really pretty pop song. I think start with that. You know, lots of pretty people and no, you know, dodgy jokes. I'd go for Richard Curtis, the montage. Start there. I'm very... I think Four Weddings is lovely. And I wrote a TV show called Blackadder. And the final episode of the final series of that is, I think, an interesting piece of work. So there are some things I like. But start with Genie. Start with Genie. - Of course. Last question for you. Which of the films that you worked on or wrote do you think changed in the editing room? Which of the films changed the most in the editing room in ways you didn't expect going in? - Oh, that's definitely Love Actually, strangely. Because Love Actually was, you know, 10 stories and it seemed to work well. And it is in a completely different order to what we wrote it in. It's unrecognizable from the original order, even though the scenes are the same. It was like playing three-dimensional chess because you could put any scene after any scene at any point. That's definitely the one that changed most. - On that note, sir, I wish you nothing but the best. Thank you for giving me your time and good luck with the rest of your speed dating. - That's so sweet. Don't go changing and Merry Christmas. - Great. See you later from Horton Held. Video: Richard Curtis | BAFTA Screenwriters' Lecture Series | BAFTA Guru – YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMcXrAPmchk Transcript: Macaron I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, welcome to the BAFTA and BFI International Screenwriters lecture series for 2013. I was on the BAFTA film committee and discovered I was the only screenwriter who'd ever been on it. And after I got over the shock, I decided that the best I could do for my screenwriting brothers and sisters was to set up a lecture series in the name of BAFTA and we were able to bring the BFI in on that. This year we got a fantastic lineup, we start with David Eskoyer, we end with Richard Curtis and in between we have Hosseina Minis, Susanna Grant and Tony Gilroy. These are serious heavy weights from the UK and from America. You will be inspired by these individuals. We have been trying to get Richard Curtis since day one of day one. So this is a huge pleasure because I had begun to give up hope that we would ever manage to lure Richard in. If you ask someone in the street to name a famous screenwriter, they probably couldn't, but they might come up with Richard Curtis. That's how famous he is. And if you look at his filmography, you're looking at the list, not the list, the list of the best selling British films of all time. He's almost created a genre of his own and has written a mirror that holds itself up to us as British people. One of the keys to the success of the series is that we don't give up on those we love and even though they come up with very, very good excuses, we just don't accept that. So it's a particular pleasure to have Richard Curtis closing the series because tonight we have some serious heavy weight writers in the audience. And I am really looking forward to hearing what he has to say. This is almost my first lecture or the other lectures I've ever given of being to my children. And I'm still doing the washing up. So I'm not exactly convinced of the efficacy of the lecture form. And also I do also want to say that everything that I say will only be partially true or as it were only true for me, which is a really important thing. I'm screenwriters on the whole don't talk to each other about what they do. For instance, I've always think it's a clever thing to leave myself notes for the next day. So I've never woken up and started writing with an empty page in front of me. There may be other people for whom the empty pages absolutely key. Without it they couldn't as it were, feel the challenge. I write enormous amounts. I write 20, 30 pages of stuff a day and hope that some of it's good. There may be other people who do the exact opposite who care about every word and don't put it down until they're sure it's right. So I seriously don't know what's right or wrong. All I can do is tell you what's true for me. And the first bit now is going to be of the evening. I've decided to use like inspiration, Jeremy Paxman. And because I'm just going to ask myself the same question a few times and try and give a few different answers. And the question is why I'll be answering that. And then I think Edith and I have agreed that we might talk about how, as it were, about the process as a little bit more and then you can ask whatever you like. The first question that I asked myself is why did I start writing films? And the answer is because someone called Michael an American asked me to write a film. So I got a phone call from my agent saying he wants to see you tonight. And I thought of the idea for the film that I was going to sell him on the Northern line. And that was the first big mistake that I've never made again, which is that I always have lived with the idea of any film that I'm going to do for at least a year before I eventually start writing it. Films can't be in factuations. They've got to be relationships. And I suppose this is my first observation that I think the difference between having a good idea for a film and a finished film that you like is the same as seeing a pretty girl at a party and being there when you're wife delivers the third baby. It's an incredibly long journey. And a good idea is only the tiny little spark at the beginning of this immense process. I came up with the idea for Michael. It was about a father and a son who both found out on the same night that the girls they were with, the girlfriend and the wife were having sex with other people. And so they both as it were left their flat and their house and moved in together in a hotel and had to as it were deal with their peculiar situations together. And it was called four eyes and fat thighs. And I think that's the only thing I really got out of it because that's weirdly close to four weddings and a funeral. So it was the first and then I wrote a draft. I went out to L.A. and I wrote a second draft under the producers E. Goli in his guest room and then he put me together with a director with whom I wrote a third draft and then we handed it in and we had what I think is quite a typical American meeting. They loved the script. They really loved it and I asked them did they have any reservations at all because their smiles were so big and they said the dialogue wasn't great. It was to English and a bit too formal. And I said, all right, then they said that the two leading characters were not good because they were both weak and they needed someone to be able to root for in the movie. And then they said, and obviously the jokes are all very English. So we'd have to think of jokes that would appear more to an American sense of humour. And then I remember saying to them that really only leaves the title and they said we hate the title. But the strange thing was they still said, can't wait to get the next draft. So I went home. I was staying with a friend of mine by the stage because I was sorted out of the nose breakdown. I got a self-induced temperature of 103 about a week later. I flew home to England and met a girl in May as sued me in perpetuity. I never delivered the script and that explains pretty well everything about what I have done since then. First, never do a project that you haven't thought about beforehand. Be sure of that you're working with people who actually like the work you do, which I think is hugely important. Choose the people you work with really carefully. This director was a lovely man but I remember when we were talking about the film the very first day. He said, oh, I so I don't know if I would have this film. When my wife left me, I'd just went out and had sex with a different girl every night for a month. And this was a film about two men who don't have ever had sex with one person in their entire lives. So he was completely and utterly the wrong man to be making this film. But most importantly, and this isn't a rule for everyone, but it sort of is explains everything since then. I decided that I would never write a film about anything that I didn't really know about very personally. I didn't know. I realized when I was writing the film where American shopped, I didn't know what they'd watched on TV when they were kids. I didn't know anything about the structure of their schools. So I came straight home and I wrote a film called Count Townboy, which was eventually called the Torguei about someone who lived in Count Town where I lived about someone who had Heifever, which I had, and about someone who's job was to be a straight man to a comedian whose name was in the script, Ron Anderson and my job was to be Rowan's straight Rowan Act in straight Ram. So I have always since then basically stuck to what I think is true to my experience and emotionally right for me. So that's why I started on a career of small personal English films. And it was absolutely key. And I think the other thing that was key in the development of myself as a screenwriter was one sentence in William Goldman's fabulous book called Adventures in the Screen Trade, which I would recommend anyone who hasn't read to read, where he said that most directors end up making films that vaguely remind them of a screenplay that they once read. And it's that sentence is the stake of fear through my heart that's dominated everything I've done since then. The next question I've asked myself is why so many of the films or the films have generally turned out as I hoped they would. And this is quite a complicated and odd thing. And I didn't realize as it was going to be the core of what I was going to say when I was asked about, and I thought, oh well, I'll write about playing lots of pop music while I'm writing. But on the whole the films that I've worked on have turned out as I intended. And I don't know how replicable it is and I don't know if my experience is very personal. But I would say that from my point of view a huge amount of the challenge facing a screenwriter is about control. And that is a very important trickieria. When it came to four weddings, I decided I was going to take it even more seriously. We made a deal that we, me and Duncan, would be involved in every part of the process of making the film, which meant being there when it was being cast, being there every day when it was shot and being there a lot of the time when it was being edited even though not all the time. And so strangely for me in the end I decided simply in order to stay alive that I would take to directing myself, which obviously comes with pluses and minuses. I am probably the worst director that I've worked with. But at least I know what I want and and how it should be and that it will be accurate. What you've got to be very careful, I'm particularly aware of how horrible it is to have a stubborn writer in the edit and I hope that I'm more ruthless in editing my own films than anyone else could possibly be. Certainly that's been my experience. I'm always saying take out more. But I do feel that you should as a writer if you can try to be there when it's done because you don't want to waste your life making or having other people make the wrong films. And now the final bit, which is the most surprising bit to me of all and I've only it's been made seem odd to you but I only started to think about it for days ago is why I have actually written the films that I've written at all. I suddenly thought why have I written this bunch of films instead of another bunch of films? I've said here when I thought of first writing movies, these were my favorite 10 films. Godfather one, Godfather two, the Avengers of Robin Hood, Doge Day off to noon, Emmanuel one, Emmanuel two, white Christmas, closing cows of the third kind, animal house and a street kind name desire. And it never even occurred to me that I could write anything like any of those films in the same way that often you end up marrying someone who's not the slightest bit like you. But there was another bunch of films which for some reason or other I felt I could identify with and could do something like and I'm interested in why I thought that, why I didn't think I could do the other type. And the strange thing to me is that I wrote my first film when I was 30 and I really ended up the key things that I've written have been on the same subjects about they've been about love and they've been about friendship and they've been about family. And thinking about tonight I've been as puzzled as some of the people who are very critical of my films are why I would bother doing it again and again and again. And I've tried to think about this. Why have I not gone down a lot of other routes? And I've taken a bit of consolation. I've got a second slide here from thinking about artists and I'm not comparing myself with these. But I don't know if you've got sugar. There are lots of cities and lots of you know cafeterias and lots of soup cans. But every time he sat down he thought, oh I know, I'll make everything a bit blue and put some flowers in it and on the whole people it'll be jumping over houses. And then if we just go on and look at the other two, oh there we go. Must have led a life of great variety but every time he put pen to paper, these people. And then just the last one, there we go. Really? Oh, I mean, all you thought, he must have been able to see there were other ways of going about things. But for some reason or other and I do think that there is a thing about style, you know, as it were brushed to paper and pen to paper, which is the thing that you do and there's probably not much that you can do about that. And so I've just been thinking that it must be the reason I've written all these films. There's because the things that I feel most deeply must be about those subjects in my own life. So I was raised in a family that was full of love. That's what was the big thing in my youth was as it were family love. And all the big emotions and all the big things that I felt have been in this area in the area of romantic love, family love, friendship and not as it were in the area of serial killers, superheroes, people who died 300 years ago, secrets, scandals, corruption, action, sporting victories, gangsters, things from outer space. All of these things that are a few gentrists to other people and take up their time were clearly not being the thing which inspired me. I've just written a lot of times about love, friends and family because it would seem that if you really write what you care about, you as it were, have no choice. And that must be why I've really written about anything else. Maybe that takes me back to the beginning. All the mistakes I made on the first firm, I found that what I do best is when I write what is true to me, what I understand. And I hope that I have listened in more ways than one, to my own instincts and my own heart. And at least for the moment, that's my explanation why I've ended up writing the things that I have. We're off. Are you ready to really push control slightly? Yes. Good. Glad to hear that. Have you got all the clips I told you that we must have really... Thanks, so they're already with Big Red Botan up there. Yeah, we're ready, we're good. Before we get to the clips, we've got to start with the question on how, how you approach writing a screenplay. I mean, just very quickly on that. I've been trying to think, how do I write a screenplay? Because I certainly don't sit down in a month or two months. I think the answer is, I think of an idea ages before. And then I kind of write a long, weird, prose poem to myself with lots of bits of dialogue in it, which is just a discussion. So I say, this might happen in the middle of these, might be the characters. This might be the end. This might be the beginning. I mean, I would never write a treatment, by the way. I think they are... shockingly bad idea. I genuinely think that a treatment is the equivalent of a prose description of a painting. I think I will draw a picture of a pretty woman with a landscape behind her and you're not quite sure whether she's smiling or sad. That's the Mona Lisa. But I genuinely think they're nonsense. So I would have never done that if I can. And then slowly, I kind of, I then I think I'd write down on cards, incidents that are in it and see whether or not, suddenly I've got 100 things that start to be in an order that's vaguely sensible. And then I will start having a go at writing. I find it really fascinating when you were talking in your lecture about how involved you are. I mean, is that quite a unique thing for a writer who's not the director of a film to be that involved through that whole process? I think it is, but we've made it work and it's been complicated. I mean, I think I really do think of my job as a screenwriter being pretty well equal. And I mean, actually, obviously, if you'll then direct in the movie, that bit's equal. My contribution to the directing of the movie was not as important, I think it's very important to be there. But I think the editing of films, again, it really is a massive rewrite. And it is a extraordinarily important part of the process. And I can't, if I could take you guys through time to see how disastrous at least four of the films that I've been involved in have been when they were thought to be finished. It is, I mean, Bridget Jones was catastrophic. Yeah. And the movie we shot, even though every single frame of it was then in the finished movie, it was not the right movie. We just got all sorts of things wrong in the screen play. Like there were two laughs in it in the whole film. And some of you who may have seen it recently and think that's more than I remember, but in front of a crowd, it used to get some laughs and we just, we were going completely the wrong reaction of the film. And then suddenly one day, we realized that the problem was that Bridget has presented on film was a pretty girl in a good job who both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth wanted to sleep with. And it was not a challenging scenario one where somebody deserved a much sympathy or interest. And so what we did quite near the end is we took the saddest scene in the film, which was right at the end when she'd been dumped for the third time by Mr. Darcy or I can't remember where it was, but it was the last five minutes or ten minutes in the movie. And we made it the credit sequence of the film. So I think it might be interesting to look at the credits of Bridget and see that the reason why people then were sympathetic and liked the film. I mean we did then cut 15 out of the next 30 minutes to try and speed it up and stuff. But the credits of this film, this was the emotional climax and end of the film until as it were she ran through snow. The strange thing is that is two, her emotion is two big for a opening credit sequence I think. Now you can see how that would have been quite near the end of the movie with her and real trouble and really, really saddened everything. But by moving that up, we changed the fate of the more swimming watch and that we go, I did that maybe about a month ago. The characters almost have, you know, do you do associate characters with certain pieces of music then as well whilst you're writing? It's a good that, it's a good that far. I don't know that it's character as much as emotional moods. Talk of emotional moods if you want to get to a point with something, do you feel like with film and with screenwriting you need to find a journey to get there as opposed to just seeing things as they are. Because you've got a great example of you just from noting hell of this the scene with Julia and you of all of all. I've actually got my pocket, my hints and if you've got time, I've got to have it as I might just tell you as it were, things tricks that I use which I'm sure will not be useful to most of you but interesting. I mean, I'd just be honest. One of the things that I found in most of my films and I was a bit torn between an example I could have given you for almost every film that sometimes when I'm stuck on a film completely and trying to work out what to do and feeling that I haven't got there, and this will unfortunately destroy the scene that everyone's about to see. But I just write exactly what the film is about in what people say. It's so often, I think it's a bit of a bit of a bit of a tradition. I actually won't, I won't quite ever say, well I let people maybe imply vaguely what the emotional journey was meant to be. And I'm quite a believer in going straight for it. So, I mean this is a, this is a, you know, key scene in Notting Hill but if you listen to it again, again, you're a discriminating audience, you probably thought the first time you saw it. Wow, this is exactly him saying what the film's about, but this was me writing straight at Notting Hill to try and say what I thought the film was about. I live in Notting Hill, you live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name. Fine. Fine, good decision. Good decision. The famous thing isn't really real, you know. And don't forget, I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy. Asking him to love her. So, well, I'm just saying there is that was a piece of work, you know, a very deliberate thing to try to exactly sum up what I thought the whole film was about. How do you know when something's funny? That's quite interesting. You do laugh when you write something funny. I mean, and that is really interesting because when we wrote Blackouter, I used to notice that because Blackouter was quite, you know, constructional, you know, you'd kind of knew what people would do and how the plot would go. And you could make things funny in a way. And there were quite a lot of things we did repetitively. And whenever I actually laughed, I would underline things. So, I would remember that actually made me laugh rather than something that I worked towards. And at the end of the whole process, Ben said, what was funny lines that used to be underneath the script? So, he'd obviously never noticed. They were the funniest lines that I'd ever read. Okay, questions from our audience. You mentioned your own family background. And whereas most family backgrounds that are mentioned are bad memories for the person telling you about them, you refer to a close and loving family background. My question is, if you had not had that kind of family background, does it mean that you simply would not have become a screenwriter or would you think have written films with influence from the kind of awful background you'd had becoming a parent? I realize in retrospect, I'm very interested in things going well. I think there is a, it's a real, it would be interesting to talk with people who disagree because I find things going well, very, very interesting. And I know that there are lots of people who when they see a situation, look for the thing that's wrong and say that's the truth. And when I have said before, that I'm sometimes puzzled by the fact that when I write films about people falling in love, they are critically taken to be sentimental and unrealistic. And yet, 4 million people in London are in love tonight and today all around the world hundreds of thousands of people will fall in love. When someone writes a film about a soldier getting a wall and breaking into a flat and murdering a young pregnant woman, something which has happened twice in history, that film will be described as seringly realistic. I don't see how that's true. I was on a beach in Southworld the other day. And you look along, you see fathers playing with their children, people in love holding hands, older couples having cups of tea with each other, no sign whatsoever of ruthless violence and hatred on that beach. Now of course I know from my work with comic relief about the dark art of the UK, but that's not the only story and I think stories of joy and love are definitely worth worth telling. And I'm a beneficiary of that. And long may tell them. APPLAUSE We feel we let you go. Can we have your tricks of a dream or what to have these? We've got our eyes. So I did just write them down. These are absurd. I cannot believe. I'm going to say this in front of me. Most books are the ready. I can't believe I'm saying this in front of Christopher Hampton. I live in a street with only two houses in the street. And I'm the second best writer in the street. And the third best director, as my son Charlie now knows more about what if I written here? I'm not going to say that. I want you all time. I've said the thing about going on the nose. Oh, this is just a hint of mine, which I do think is helpful if you're a writer. Is when I get stuck, which is often, I always write 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in the gap on the page. And then I give myself five goals at the problem. So I don't have that dreadful pressure of thinking, I've got to get it right. There's time, what is he going to say to her, what can they do? I just write something that's the same as the thing I wrote before, something that's a bit different. Something that's completely different, something with another character and something from our spaces at web. And by the time you've relaxed enough to write the five, you often find that somewhere in the five is the answer that you need, whereas the pressure of having to get it right, I find very hard. To get right was book often. No, I mean, I get completely stuck. And that's when I start typing and sit down with a pad and write impensal. So I can't see what I'm doing. This is bad thing to reveal, but I do. I have to admit that I do sometimes at certain points, right, as I say, like a mixing desk. I've got to a certain point and I can see it's all a bit fungi. And so I say, if you've ever been in a studio when they're making a record, it's so annoying, because they turn up the sacks and then they fiddle with the sacks for two hours. And you say, oh, god, this is all going to be sacks. The whole thing. And then they fix the sacks and then they pull it down and it rejoins the track. And I do have some days where I just say, I've just got to do plot. I'm sure there's something wrong. So I just do plot. And then the next day, I've taped down the plot and lift out the character. And I get characters, why don't you talk and do each other convincingly. And they talk to each other all day. And then when I fix that, I reintroduce that. And then I'll do jokes and other day. I said, just isn't funny enough, and I'm going to go through it all and try and do that. So that's another, as it were, workmen like trick that I do. Never leave a black page in the morning. This is the most important one of all. Don't call your boys by girls names and your girls by boys names. It's so annoying when you read a script and the husbands call Carol and the wife's called Alex. And the whole way through the film, you can't remember who why. And then for some reason, her other Alex is giving birth to somebody and stuff. So you can change the when the actors have faces. You can call them whatever you like, but in a script, call them by names that are identified by the right sex. This was a card just to say, if anybody ever talks about the death of romantic comedy, I think that should be ignored because I think good romantic comedies are funny films about love. And I would say this decade we've had lost in translation, 500 days of summer, a tunnel sunshine at the spotless mine. These are great great films about love. Probably better than in the 10 years before they were, all the 10 years before that. So I think it's just a question in terms of movies about love of rephrasing it and not just going by by a formula. And then the most important one of all, oh no, here's one, not very important one. Which is if you're a writing comedy and you want to make something funnier, the web way to do it is go to where it's already funny and make it a bit funny at the mad. So in Notting Hill there's a scene where Hugh goes in and he's pretending he's from horse and hound and he interviews due to and when Tim Bevan gave me his note that he's given on every single film I've ever written, which is not very funny is it. Then I went to that bit and I thought, okay, so he comes out and I knew that bit was funny and I thought, how can I extend that bit rather than finding another bit where I make it all funny? So I thought what would happen if we came out on the corridor and then we said, now you can talk to everybody else. So that's just a little practical comedy hint. And then this is the last one I've written where I say love yourself 99% failure is a triumph. And I often do think that I think when I'm talking to people who are writing and they say, if I write and there's one good bit that is an extraordinary day and I will think I'll end it and I'll think I've really got that bit and wouldn't it been my I can see that being in the final film and I know that many young writers they write and they say it's all shit and then they say, I mean there was one bit there might be okay but the whole day was dreadful and you've got to just reverse that and see that if you've produced anything that's of worth in terms of the life of writing a film because films are quite quick to write because they're just dialogue you could type out a film in three days you couldn't type out an novel in three days but you should be proud of hope full of observant for anything that's anything that's good. Which I thank you so much for tonight could have been very helpful for the film. Video: Richard Curtis - Exclusive 'About Time' Interview (2013) | Rotten Tomatoes – YouTube https://youtu.be/74mMMMnjZjw Transcript: Yes, great-ray course and hound magazine. Oh, my goodness! It may be you see that film again. There's a castle made of horse and hound. And when I saw it, they'd done the front cover and they'd misspelled the word millennium. No. So it's gone a little leaf. I took a leaf off. I put a plant next to it. Took a leaf off it and put the leaf over the mistlete of millennium. Yes. This is going to sound strange. But there's this family's secret, but the men in the family can travel in time. This is such a weird joke. Your movies are responsible for so many warm fuzzies in my life. I was looking through them all and I mean, for God's sake, even it's not even just the specifically romantic ones. You don't war horse has that element. Right? Yeah, it's just even I will tell him that he's good at warm fuzzies. Yes. I, as far as I'm concerned, I'm a huge fan and I think that you're sensing that as I sit very close to you. I want to know like what is your idea of the most romantic date that you could be on? I was mess up romantic days. That's the point. There's a scene in love actually where he goes and we then can go outside care as door and he's got a course there. And I remember writing five ideas for that. I'm going out into my office where there were four girls typing and saying which of these is a good idea. And then I did the first one. They went, ah, the second one. Yeah, no, I'd hate the guy and then fortunately one of them, the cars, one, they said, oh, maybe that'll be all right. So just because I write about it doesn't necessarily mean I'm any good at the romantic things myself. Okay. And I think the thing that made my life turn out all right was realizing what sort of person I should be going out with. I remember driving along in the car and saying I must stop trying to go out. I must go out with someone talkative. Ah, that makes sense. That's the most important thing ever. A beautiful moment in anybody's life when they realize the partner that they're looking for. Yeah. I like that. Have you ever had a particularly memorable New Year's Eve like in the film? A good Orbad. Oh, New Year's Eve was always so awful for me. I mean, so, my main memory of New Year's Eve is like my daughter, my parents cracking in about 11, 30 and saying, do you mind if you go to bed? And then going in and kissing my mum and she used to wear cold cream. And when you kissed her, you would fall off her face onto the arms and the pillow. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve just like the ones there. And they would play charades and at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. And then we started going to a family and New Year's Eve. Just like the ones there, and they would play charades. And at 12 o'clock you'd be playing, you'd be trying to mind jaws. So that New Year's Eve has always been so depressing for me. Well, and you get a chance to kind of make these things into fantastic films, I see, from the stories. Well, I do in the end end up writing about things that I care about. And thus, post love and family and friendship, but being the things that have got me through. Not, I'm superheroes and great sporting occasions. Would you say that you learn from something and situation in the right about it? Or backwards? You write about it and learn from that. Such a good question. Then this case and this fellow, I tried to write myself into a corner where I actually think about what the film is about, which is enjoying a normal day. Video: Richard Curtis Reveals What Happens To LOVE ACTUALLY Characters 20 Years Later | INTERVIEW | Jake’s Takes – YouTube https://youtu.be/rssrnQXOc8o Transcript: \\"The story that I loved two decades ago \\"is different than the story I love now as an adult.\\" So two decades later, what is the storyline that you see most differently? Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. (dramatic music) - Where we're going, we don't need roads. (dramatic music) - Mr. Curtis, an honor to see you again, sir. How are you? - I'm very happy now. It's, you know, it's pitch black here in England. - It'll be pitch black in Chicago in about four hours. So we're right behind you, sir. I'm gonna jump into this. - We're ready for mulled wine over here. - Oh, always. I exist in a constant state of ready for that. I'm gonna jump into this. You know, for so many people, Christmas movies are a tradition. They watch the same ones every year. It's a comfort for many of us, but I want to know for the people who create these Christmas movies, whether you're writing or you're directing them, do you allow your own films to be a part of your Christmas tradition? Would you ever gather the family around and say, \\"All right, guys, it's time to watch 'Genie.' \\"All right, guys, gather the kids. \\"It's time to watch 'Love Actually.'\\" - I mean, I think they'd kill me if I said it was time to watch \\"Love Actually\\" again, but maybe this year. I mean, I don't know. Our family aren't getting together till, you know, December the 18th, and we might watch the \\"Genie\\" film this year if we can hold off. That is a possibility, even though it's a- - A battle between anything I've ever tried and Elf. And normally Elf wins. - I would always choose you, sir, over Elf, always. When you start talking about genies, I try not to ask cliche junket questions, but the concept of wishes is always gonna come up. So I'm gonna try to approach this from an angle that not everyone's doing. When you first put pen to paper and start writing a script, what is wish number one that you really hope comes true? - Wow, I mean, look. My friend Danny Boyle said that the secret behind movies, the only thing that matters in a movie, as he said, is the beginning and the end, and the beginning not so much. So the first thing I hope for is that the movie's got a good end. 'Cause no matter how hard you try, if the end's no good, everyone walks away saying, \\"I didn't enjoy that much.\\" And this movie started with the end. I kind of knew where it was going the whole way through. My wish is always that I'm not hoping the end appears, but that I start knowing with how it's gonna finish. - Can I just honestly tell you, and I wouldn't say this if I didn't believe it, it's a great ending. It's honestly, it's fantastic. So you crushed it. If I didn't believe so, I would just awkwardly move on to the next question. So you absolutely crushed it. - Thank you very much. - Yes, sir. You know, speaking of, you mentioned \\"Love Actually\\" before, 20 years since it hit theaters. And the thing I always say is that movies don't change. We change. The story that I loved two decades ago is different than the story I love now as an adult. So two decades later, what is the storyline that you see most differently? Not because the movie has changed, but because you've changed. - Oh, that's such an interesting question. Do you know, now that my life is sort of calmer, and now that I'm a gentle, older man, last time I watched it, I really loved the stupid story with Colin going to America. I thought I wasted my youth and I wish I was 27 again. So I'm sorry, I've got more shallow rather than more deep. - I just love just how that story turns out. The walking into the bar, it's brilliant. It still yields one of the biggest laughs every time one of the girls walks in. People think I'm crazy when I say this, but I truly believe that love actually is the reason that \\"All I Want for Christmas\\" has become the hit that it is, why it plays every year. Can you talk about using that song in the film and the impact you think love actually had on it? - I mean, don't say that anywhere near Mariah Carey. She's gonna sue you out of your job. But the truth of the matter is, I really listened to that a lot while I was writing the movie. You know, you're sitting in a dark office in the middle of March. and you're just dreaming about a movie. And that song is so irresistibly cheerful that I would sometimes like put it on a loop. So it was kind of the fuel behind the movie. So if I've managed to get rack up any extra sales from Mariah, I'm delighted. - Because God knows she needs it. - I don't think she needs it. - You know, it's, I feel like the sign of a good movie and it's the same case with \\"Genie\\" as well. But a sign of a good movie is when it's over years later, you're still wondering, I wonder what happened to those characters. I know we got a little bit of a follow-up on \\"Red Nose Day\\" but I'm sort of curious of all the \\"Love Actually\\" storylines, which one is the most that you find yourself wondering, where are they today, 20 years later? - Well, I mean, I think Hugh Grant would definitely be divorced. I don't think there's any doubt in that. I think what I do is I tick through them and say if any of them lasted 20 years. I think the naked couple would have lasted but Hugh would be onto his third wife. There's no doubt about it. - That's fantastic. I've got to tell you, swinging back around to \\"Genie,\\" there is a line in the script that literally made me spit out my drink. And it's when Melissa says about Jesus Christ being the son of God. I thought he was kidding. I've got to tell you, you have made lines that make me laugh, that make me cry. The \\"my son, my dad\\" moment from \\"About Time,\\" I crumble every time I watch that. So I'm sort of curious for you, I know you're sort of very close to all these projects, but what is the line or the moment you've written or directed in your career? that still has the most emotional effect on you when it's played out on the screen? Well, do you know, I think, I mean, there's a lovely line at the end of this one, you know, when Melissa says most people are cruel and selfish, but that was never you. And I think she did that phrasing. And I love that. I like the end of About Time, where he says, you know, life's a roller coaster, we have to relish this remarkable ride. That's kind of what I'm trying to do every day. Just see what's around you. Try not to hope for more and see whether you can just enjoy the texture of every day. I love that. Mr. Curtis, I asked for extra time with you just because I'm such a fan of you and your work. So in every word that you've put down on paper is a blessing to all of us. So I appreciate you giving me that time. And thank you for always doing just such incredible work that makes all of our lives richer, man. It was a real always an honor to speak with you. You're so sweet. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Bye guys. Video: Richard Curtis: Christmas Forces My Family To Come Home 🎄| Virgin Radio UK -YouTube https://youtu.be/pxpp0C7wIPA Transcript: So this is in London on the 7th to the 11th of December. It's an amazing show curated by this man here. This genius in front of us. Yes. The South Bank Centre, tickets available southbank centre.co.co.com. Can I say they are? It really is a case of well-stocks last. I think if anyone does want to go, they should like do it today. Oh, right. They're selling fast. Of course they are. Southbank Centre.co. What, what makes the question? How come, why wouldn't you run this for longer? Because people would go and see this for like a month. Well, I do have a little plan, which is that if it works out and if it turns out to be a kind of script that's reproducible, I would love it to be something that lots of theatres could do from year to year and maybe even schools could do and maybe they could even do an Australian America. It's kind of because some of the money is going to come at really. So the idea would be just like, you know, J.M. Barry, don't, don't, some of the money from Peter Pan always go to the great Ormans Street. All of it. All of it. So I've got a little hope that if it works out well, if we get as sufficiently enthusiastic and merry audience, that it might be something that lasts. J.M. That was, he was a guy I wasn't he. His story is unbelievable, isn't it? He was a single parent, wasn't he? And he carried on writing was a great dad, wrote all these amazing stories and posthumously every single penny of profit from his estate goes to great Ormans Street. Did you think I should do that? I think it's worse than done. You're not following me, or leader. Okay, I should give nothing to charity after I die. Richard, I think you've done you bit by the way. I mean, a lot of health from you. We've had some fun over the years. We sold the Queen's car last year on the way. We sold the New Times, just a couple of days ago, children need something. Congratulations, I think. But that was so far. Well, more than the mutual party. That was Matthew's idea. Yeah, what's this? So you got a car frame, I said, I know, but I think we're dealing it on. Anyway, this is great, man. And how much you love Christmas, I attend? You still have full on 10? Yeah, I'm still full on 10 because it is. You know, I've just made this genie movie. And the genie movie is all about, you know, you get a genie. You could have anything in the world, but the thing that you most want really is just have a lovely meal with your family. And Christmas forces my family, who many of them are fled to America. To come home and it's the one time we see them. And I like Turkey. Right before. Before. So by the way, I love Turkey. I want to have it more often. Yeah, don't you? Well, I want to have it more often. I want to have it both out of cold. Yeah, I love it. I love it. Picked. To win right now, pull off. Poor us, cafe. Our on mile a bone, Lane. Just takes how much is now. We should go ahead and neck. We should go after this. Yeah. Before we move on, just one more plug for this. Christmas actually, Southbank Center's Royal Festival Hall, 70, 11th December. Lots of the province going to comet relief. It's a great show. This man in front of us curated it. He noticed his Christmas trees. There are lights. There's smoke. There's mystery. There's even a scary bit in it. Southbank Center. Yeah. So what is the arc? It just give us the elevator pitch of the arc of the tale. Well, no, no, it's not a story. Right. It's a misson and a knee. So you come on and you think, what's going to happen? And then everything happens. And we get literally all my favorite things. We like to tell four Christmas stories. There's the Christmas in the trenches story. There's the bandage story. There's the story about how a polo eight went around the moon on Christmas day and took the first pictures of the, you know, that we've ever seen of the earth from space. We went to the moon, but we discovered the earth. And then flowing, Joan, who are those brilliant comedy, they're going to come on and play. And I guess, star rocks up and gives presents to the audience. I mean, I think anybody who comes and isn't entertained wasn't alive when they entered the building. Yeah. Okay. That's great. So those four stories, that's why it could roll out. I was wondering how you're going to roll it out if you don't have a story, but that's how come. Yeah. And the songs are written in the song. Yeah. I mean, there is some fantastic, we've just been to this thing with the, if we're going to at the end of it, we're going to sing all I want for Christmas is you. And I've got the members of the cast of the film, filmed them holding up the lyrics in the same way as Andrew Lincoln held up the card. So you can sing along and they'll be Bill Nye and Andrew Lincoln. I mean, here are nightly and stuff. So it's full of gimmicks. There's a little bit of Charlie Mackenzie in there. You know, it's going to be, I think it'll be gorgeous. Just briefly on Bill Nye's role. Yes. I mean, love actually. Yes. He was first engaged for the read through as a reader. And that is an accepted role in acting in the world of acting. And you are, you, you accept that role on the understanding that you're not, you're not auditioning for the film. You're merely helping the writers to get the script right. I've seen him on stage. I hadn't liked him. He rocked up there because we were thinking of casting two other people. Couldn't decide who this is true. Bill turns up. Does it so perfectly? He gets a laugh for every line. We cast him five minutes later. And I've, every film I've done since then has been in. Wow. And it was a really, really lucky day. Who were the others for me? I've never revealed them. But they were. Just a can't remember them. You're six years. Actually, I think one of them was Robby Cole train for instance. Okay. I mean, he wouldn't mind you saying that. Well, he's not a lot of other people. I know. I know I'm aware that he's deceased. I know that go wrong. It's going so well to them. It's not a point. A gene. Well, but life is a rich mixture of sorrow and joy. And we're just trying to pump up the joy. Pump up the joy, man. Pump up the joy, pump up the jam. So, Jeannie, this film, sorry. Listen, McCarthy. Yes. Now, the last time we exchanged emails in the middle of the night, I think you were off to direct her or something. Well, I wasn't directing, but I was thinking of that to eat the craft table. You're a parachute to didn't work. Something happened. All right. So, what is Jeannie? How did it come about? How happy are you with it, etc. I'm doing it all the work here. Aren't these the, you ask your questions now. Well, you're telling me some stuff. It's the last time I fired the shark tell me about this before. I think it's the big piece. It's a very funny and joyful film. It's based on a film I originally made with Alan coming. Lenny Henry and Drone Accumson. Alan coming has aged. He was like 25 then. He's now 55. And he's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's a great singer. He's like 25 then. He's now 55. And he is playing the villain. I saw he's playing the villain's part in it. But the Jeannie is now played by Melissa McCarthy. She is fabulous. I mean, she's such a sweet woman and a funny woman. Many comedians are cool. You know that. You've come across them. But she's so gentle and so all the emotion in this story. She carries. But she's also hilarious and very amusing. The dress and Papa SEA do one of Britain's greatest actors. The greatest handler to his generation is playing Burnett. And his life is going very wrong. He rubs a box outpops Melissa McCarthy with hilarious consequences for a burn hour. And then there's like a sad bit where it turns out their best friends ever. And then there's a happy bit where everything turns out well. So this is all on Sky. Sky is from the first of the family called Jeannie. Tell us about the world of proper movies. Not straight to video movies as they were once straight to TV movies as they would be now. But proper movies now getting their first their premiere on domestic platforms. Tell us about that world. How that's changed filmmaking. Well, I mean, I don't we try this hard on this. I've tried on any other. That's what I mean. That came out. So I think the truth is that it's just a kind of different kind of quality control. You know, they make a lot of movies for streamers. A lot of them people don't not many people watch. We hope that millions of people watch this. When you try as hard as you possibly can, the budget was actually great. I mean, one of the reasons I did this movie is I wanted to make a Christmas movie set in New York. You know, because all my movies are set in the street where I live. Basically, I'm sheer laziness. But I wanted to make a movie that had a wide shot of the Empire State Building in it. That's literally true. But I think that's true. It's actually the not in the street where you live. The street down from where you live. So you can still get to sleep at night. Yeah. And when I wrote Notting Hill, I sent out the location fighter to come up with the house. That a huge grant's character could live it. And he came back with one Polaroid photograph. And it was of the my front door. And I thought that's a joke. But it turned out to be right. But unfortunately, they then built use flat at Pinewood. I think, well, shut up. Yeah. I don't remember which. So I still had to travel into work. That house came up with a cell a couple years ago again. Did it? Your house, yeah. Yeah, I should never have sold. It was beautiful. What a beautiful house. No. So, yeah. So we flew to New York. We filmed in the snow. We filmed. We also snowed. What's your snow like? I'm not going to reveal that in case it breaks the magic for the viewer. But then quite a lot of it's been added. True lies. I think true lies snow was salt. Salt is the best, isn't it? I don't know. I noticed that some of the snow was just sort of fabric. Right. Yeah. In the distance it's fabric. And then some of it's some of it's. Oh my goodness. So even Richard, even at the age of you are, you still have a bucket list of movies to be made and where to make them and why. Yeah, I think I should make the thing I'm thinking about is I think I should make them slightly funny a version of the life of Napoleon. I feel that really. I've seen it. Yeah. But I feel probably not as many gags. Not as many. Not as many hype gags as I think I would. You did anything I think I would go for. I mean, you have previous as far as that's concerned. Oh my goodness. I was talking to you now last night about you coming on today. Because we were playing the Beatles. So last night we had, um, there's no night. It's just no night. At T-Tama in a Monday, it's a good day. It's about 14. Right. To the back half six. And, um, he was playing some Beastie boys yesterday. And he said, how could of the Beastie was? I said, yeah, I know. But can you imagine them rocking out to the songs in period having just written them? I mean, they're great now. But in the kings of the world, then. And then we had, there was a quantum leap. I think we went somewhere else. We went to, there's a particular Beastie boys on which is the most downloaded, I can't remember the name of it. It's not quite for you right. But, um, and it sounds for all the world. Like, I thought it sounded like Joy Division and the level of Terrors of Part that began in a sense. I said stick on Joy Division. One of those great conversations. You know, when you stand out, they're the best, right? I know. And he'd never heard of Joy Division. And then, and then we put on level of Terrors of Part. And then he said, it doesn't, it's a satisity. Will in a minute. He said, oh, yeah, I get what you mean. And then he said, but this sounds like Pimbo. Where's it? On Ghost Pimbo, where's it? He then he asked me about the Beatles and about guitars. And I said, well, no, a lot of the Beatles songs. Um, if you listen to the, um, the demos on, uh, for example, the anthology, which is amazing. So, so Richard, we stuck those on. And I was literally weeping. I was sobbing because of the beauty of. If you listen, if you hear the demo of, um, George Harrison's Walmart guitar gently weeps, you know, and he wasn't, he, he was no one near the best songwriter in the Beatles. You listen to that song and that vocal. And his original acoustic guitar, it will break your heart into a million pieces and you don't know why. And I still don't know why. But I had to be reassembled to go and pick you like that. But I had past six. Anyway, we get onto that and we're talking about you because you love the Beatles. We always have our Beatles conversations. And then I said, you know, notting hell. You won't, excuse me? And I realized he's not seeing nothing hell. Four weddings in the funeral. He's not seeing four weddings in the funeral. He's got this all to come. Well done, you. These films that young people don't watch. These films are great. Oh, okay. And they're seminal and they're at least. Well, that's very, you know, it's, I feel just very lucky. You write what you write. You hope that people like it. And then, you know, if they turn out to be repeatable, that is fabulous. And then, I did do that film yesterday, you know, which was sort of about the Beatles. And I've had some fun with my son recently. He used to be so against the Beatles, you know, absolutely wrapped generation. He said, Dad, they write nursery rhymes. He said, everything rhymes. They're silly little tunes. And now he's completely spun over. And I got a text from him saying, have you ever heard till there was you? Which is like the sweetest cover version by the Beatles and everything. So, you know, eventually they're going to creep into your soul. Well, he wasn't, he wasn't anti-Beatlers. He was anti-Dat. Yeah, I wasn't. Yeah, that's what that was. That'd be the same. And by the time you realised your mum and dad were right about the Beatles, you've got a kid who thinks you're wrong about the Beatles. Um, do you know, when I was little, the Beatles came to Sweden where I was living. And it was so, I mean, my parents were always so naive. It didn't occur to them. We were utterly obsessed by the Beatles. That if the Beatles come to Sweden, you could buy a ticket to see them play their music. Yeah. Just didn't occur to them. So, for four days in a row, me and my sisters would driven by my dad to stand outside the Ferresta hotel and wait for the Beatles to come out on the balcony. And we were there in the snow and finally the four of them came out and weaved to us. And that was the best moment in my life until now. Until you saw the peeing the playground. That's the best. No, I'm not going to talk about it. But that's your comedy philosophy. My comedy philosophy is repetition is a good thing. It's just like every joke that we have with our friends is a joke that we had with our friends, the day before and the day before and the day before. So, you've written this film, this Christmas film, based in New York, some of the And I'm before. The Napoleon film with Gags could happen. My very well-loved up and now you said out loud. What are the boxes you might want to take making? Because you said you were going to stop doing all this. You said that a few times. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Actually, it's quite interesting. I've got a... Someone's talking to me about this metaphor the other day that you can't... You can't leap onto a new trapeze until you let go of the one you've been holding. So, I'm actually aiming for one of those moments where I'm going to sort of stop not having any new commitments and then find out what, as a human being, I would like to do the new thing I'm going to grasp. What's going to come to you? Well, I'm thinking of poetry, Chris. No, you know. It's a piece of things. I might write a play. I'd like to be a DJ. I think that's really easy. Well, we did it by the way. I know that. I've heard that. I've got friends who are DJs. They never do any homework. They just ask you any old random questions. They say, what's happening, etc. etc. I think I could do that. Well, if you could do that. Then why did you employ a load of those as consultants on your film? They're both their rocks. Oh, okay. He's paid me once. He paid me once to be a consultant. A movie consultant. You have paid. Oh, we got it. You're so pretty. I think you're the film. You've just been the best. So might leave for that. With 30 years of service to come, I really feel like I've got my own back. Good. So what's the answer to the question? Seriously, I don't know. I think you've got to be a movie consultant. Maybe you find out. Still films, though. Well, I don't know. As I say, I think you might write a play. I might be getting involved in a musical. Oh, that says like it's happening. Please check your whole body line. Just change. I don't know. We'll have to keep some secrets. He's that I've got a secret. I've tried to encourage me. My now wife is trying to encourage me to write four funerals and a wedding. It's going to happen. Because we do go to quite a lot of funerals. And we just are arguing about... No, we're arguing about the wedding. Because I think the wedding should be a lovely wedding with young people. She thinks the wedding should be a death bed wedding. But I said, you know, one of those words were just as the guys about to concoat. He says marry me and then he dies as he's shoving the ring on the finger. So that would be four funerals and a funeral wedding. Well, exactly. That's where I think the weakness is. No, no, it's not a deal. Like being in the rightful stream, four funerals and a wedding. That's one of the funerals. But people think it's the wedding. But no, the wedding still comes. Because that's also the funeral. Well, no, no, you have three funerals. Then the wedding, then the other funeral straightaway. I disagree with you because she wrote for me. That's a great idea, though, isn't it? Well, I look. She used to have to pitch to people. Oh, did people say, please come in. Here's the door. Would you like to your coffee? Well, I think if I pitch then Napoleon, let's forget this. Just try the Napoleon thing on the back burner for him. Yeah, I mean, I've tended to have quite mainstream ideas. So it's often, you know, easier. But yeah, no, I don't get anything for free. And there's a brilliant young generation of filmmakers who are much much better than me. Have you seen Raelane? No. Oh, that's why I don't want you to see many movies as a used to it. Yeah, no, that's why I'm a bit silly and now. Movies. Just as you get older, yeah. So like, when I see the billboard if someone dressed up as someone. Right. You go, it just looks like you're dressing up party now. Unless they're a genie. Yeah, and it's not just what you're, you're films. Yeah, you have to be dressed like a Christmas. You know what I mean? Cause I used to love to suspend disbelief and dive straight in. But now, I mean, you know, movies like all quiet in the western front. Of course, of course. And I had, which we watched at the weekend, if you see Niyad, 24-5-7. Oh, the chain. Oh, that's really exciting. Do you know, I feel what you feel when I'm watching Subhiir and movies now? I think, oh, that's poor actor. You know, they've had to muscle up so much. And they're dressed like, you know, a child that I've had to dress party. Yeah. And they're having to have really slow, serious conversations about the end of the world. And I do, I do worry about them. But I saw this movie past lives recently. There's a beautiful. Starting. Can't remember either of the names of the actors. Big, big. No, it's a tiny little sort of career in the movie. No, no, no. And then you nickel a skidge, me be supposed to be nice as well. Yeah, my kids saw it. I was once at a stage. Hello. A skidge. Honestly, it was so exciting. That's actually his face. That's actually what his face looks like. A stage stage. We're going to finish with the Beatles now. And then, um, Thank you for coming in. You're amazing. Well, if anybody wants to see that show, see the show. If anybody wants to have a life of laughter, watch the genie. And if anyone wants to be happy for the rest of their lives, listen to Chris. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. I'm very, very, very, very, very. Oh. And if anybody wants to fund, should we make, look, let's go at war six, six funerals and four weddings. Oh, my God. Let's, let's make that show. Sounds like the new football football when everybody scores later goals. Var. Exactly. Var should appear. Right. Right. Let me do this properly. So, Christmas actually, the South Bank centres are all festival in London. A seventh till the 11th of December, Royal Festival Hall. Yeah. Yeah. South Bank Centre dot code of T.K. Book for that now. Genie is on Sky Cinema from the first of December. And four funerals and a wedding is going to happen. We were in the conversation. So technically we are contributors. So change your word, take a third or kind of stuff. Yeah. You'll be hearing from our people. And I could see you playing a priest. Tang what? A priest. A priest? No, a priest. I can see you. I can see you in the cameo. We've always planned. Cameo? Yeah. Cameo? Ha ha ha ha ha. All right then. Bye. 1. A very brief background of the writer and the films known for writing Richard Curtis - who was born in New Zealand and moved to London when he was 11 - has been one of the most influential, profitable, and talked about figures in British comedy. The talented 67-year-old has written more rom-coms than Sainsbury's stocks popcorn for with classics such as Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, and Love Actually all coming from his fair hand. In addition to the epic filmography, Richard also penned Blackadder, Mr. Bean and The Vicar of Dibley. When he's not tickling your funny bones, he is the co-founder of British charity Comic Relief along with comedian Lenny Henry. As if that's not enough for his CV, Richard Curtis has also been awarded a CBE by the Queen, won two BAFTAs and been nominated for an Academy Award... Is there no stopping him?! Windle L (2017) COMIC RELIEF LAUNCH Who’s on The One Show tonight?

Identify and define the writer’s approach to the screenwriting process? Curtis has described himself as the ‘luckiest man in movies’ for having the chance to write multiple redrafts – with the assistance of his partner Emma Freud – and the power to influence casting choices, select the director, and to intervene during the shooting and editing process. He has also made no denial that his scripts are largely based on his own career and personal experiences. He only writes ‘on something he was a hundred percent sure of and no one in the world knew more about than him’. Leggott J (2012) ‘Travels in Curtisland: Richard Curtis and British Comedy Cinema’, British Comedy Cinema, 184-195, Routledge. 3. What narrative structures and themes does the writer typically use within their writing and films? Curtis-ian elements of cinematic comedy were present right from the start. First, there is the classic “fish out of water” hero…Next, there is the “love interest,” a thoroughly modern young woman…And finally, there is the “last act dash”...Those same essential elements, held together by an apparently unceasing stream of jokes and one-liners... would be used by Curtis in his hugely successful romantic comedies. That there are enough narrative, thematic and tonal similarities between all of his major films to establish Curtis as an auteur is usually taken as a given...a philosophy about love and human dependency that had simmered throughout the entire Curtis oeuvre. Romantic comedy is the main genre, but Curtis injects social commentary and explores cultural clashes. He uses elements like pop culture references, music, and high/low culture clashes to generate humor and drama. (e.g., contrasting references to David Cassidy and John Lennon with the National Film Theatre in \\"Four Weddings\\") There's some variation in tone and style between films (\\"The Girl in the Cafe\\" vs. \\"The Boat That Rocked\\"). There's a recurring theme of the value and commoditization of art (e.g., \\"Bean\\" with Whistler's Mother painting). Keady M (2020) The Great Screenwriters: Part 29 – Richard Curtis, The Script Lab website, accessed 21 March 2024. https://thescriptlab.com/features/screenwriting-101/11472-the-great-screenwriters-part-29-richard-curtis/ Leggott J (2012) ‘Travels in Curtisland: Richard Curtis and British Comedy Cinema’, British Comedy Cinema, 184-195, Routledge. 4. What insights do they have to the screenwriting process? Curtis's insights into the screenwriting process highlight the importance of authenticity, personal connection to the material, and the power of collaboration. He values storytelling that resonates with audiences on an emotional level while incorporating elements of humor and wit.

Additional information: Screenwriter Richard Curtis's own experiences as a wedding attendee inspired Four Weddings and a Funeral. According to Curtis he began writing the script at age 34, after realising he had attended 65 weddings in an 11-year period. At one wedding he was propositioned by a fellow guest, but he turned her down and forever regretted it; accordingly he based the origin of Charles and Carrie's romance on that situation. It took Curtis 19 drafts to reach the final version. He has commented on director Mike Newell's influence; \\"I come from a school where making it funny is what matters. Mike was obsessed with keeping it real. Every character, no matter how small, has a story, not just three funny lines. It's a romantic film about love and friendship that swims in a sea of jokes.\\" Curtis chose to omit any mention of the characters' careers, because he didn't think a group of friends would realistically discuss their jobs while together at a wedding.

He is also the founder of the British charity Comic Relief. Richard Curtis is probably the most successful comedy writer in the world due to one of his many characters: Mr. Bean. He created the 15-show series with actor Rowan Atkinson and it has become one of the most successful British cultural exports in history with hundreds of millions of fans worldwide. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. His fascination with love stories began at age seven after he became infatuated with a girl who rejected him. He remained obsessed for two years. “I was always an absolute fool for love... somewhere deep inside, that is a problem,\\" he said, adding. \\"Definitely, there was some psychological freakery there.' At 13, he won a scholarship to private school Harrow, where he excelled, and left as ‘head boy’. He also won a place at Oxford University where he became friends with Mr. Bean actor Rowan Atkinson and they worked together on Atkinson’s Edinburgh Fringe show. After graduation, Richard co-wrote the British comedy classic Blackadder, which ran through the '80s with Atkinson as its star. The program also cemented the comedy careers of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie. In 1989, Richard wrote his first comedy movie: The Tall Guy starring Jeff Goldblum and Emma Thompson. By the ‘90s he was a big name in British comedy and an international celebrity when his low-budget movie Four Weddings and a Funeral became a runaway success. He followed that with the first Mr. Bean movie, then broke box office records again with the Julia Roberts and Grant movie Notting Hill (1999). The hits kept on rolling though the 2000s as he has worked with stars such as Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Dustin Hoffman. He co-founded Comic Relief in 1985, a British charity that has raised more than 1bn by getting famous people to do silly things and by encouraging others to wear clown red noses. Richard’s charity work started almost by accident. Like many others, he’d been deeply affected by Live Aid. “I happened to go to dinner and met a girl who ran a charity and was about to go out to Ethiopia,” he said. He went with her and found the experience ‘startling’. “I was there towards the end of the famine, but I saw things of such horror that I couldn’t stand by and do nothing. You’d have a situation where people were separated into different corrugated iron huts - one would have people who were going to die that night, the next would be people who were probably going to die - and the last hut was people who might just survive.” He never got over it. When he returned to London, he decided to do everything he could to make comedy contribute to aid - from stage shows, to TV, to merchandise, as if he were the CEO of a business. Comic Relief’s aim is to create a just world, free from poverty. That’s also the aim of the campaign group Make Poverty History, which Richard also founded. It’s a coalition of aid agencies and campaign groups that lobby to cancel Third World debt among other goals. He’s pointedly aware of the “slightly peculiar contradiction in my life between the Comic Relief side and the comedy writing side,” but has an explanation. “What we do on Red Nose Day is make things as funny as we can so that people can see the other side to all the sadness we show,” he said. “I suppose what we are fighting for is that everyone should have the privilege of leading a happy life and being able to laugh like the rest of us instead of being worried that their husband is going to beat them up or they are going to die of a mosquito bite.” Richard considers Comic Relief and Make Poverty History to be his main priorities even at the expense of his personal life. “I help edit almost every appeal film we do,” he said in 2019. “When I see a film about a child who hasn’t got a mosquito net, and the impact that makes, I’ll then write to Kiera Knightley and ask her to do something to help us scale the impact.” Given all the materials and video transcripts above, write me a video script with a length of minimum 5 minutes and maximum 7 minutes that satisfy these requirements: \\"please reflect on the following questions A very brief background of Richard Curtis and the films known for writing Identify and define the writer’s approach to the screenwriting process?
