This follows from the polynomial division algorithm. 3. **Integration of Linear Polynomials**: If ( q(x) = ax + b ), then: [ int_{-1}^{1} q(x) , dx = int_{-1}^{1} (ax + b) , dx = a int_{-1}^{1} x , dx + b int_{-1}^{1} 1 , dx = 0 + 2b = 2b ] Using Gaussian Quadrature, we approximate this integral by evaluating ( q(x) ) at specific points ( s ) and ( t ): [ int_{-1}^{1} q(x) , dx = qleft(-frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right) + qleft(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right) ] 4. **Final Integration**: For the polynomial ( f(x) ): [ int_{-1}^{1} f(x) , dx = int_{-1}^{1} left[ p(x)(3x^2 - 1) + q(x) right] , dx = int_{-1}^{1} q(x) , dx ] Since ( int_{-1}^{1} p(x)(3x^2 - 1) , dx = 0 ) due to orthogonality, we have: [ int_{-1}^{1} f(x) , dx = qleft(-frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right) + qleft(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right) = fleft(-frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right) + fleft(frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right) ] Thus, the constants are ( u = 1 ), ( v = 1 ), ( s = -frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ), and ( t = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ).

The top face vertices corresponding to these are E, F, G, and H respectively. - In the base face, the pairs of parallel edges are: - overline{AB} and overline{CD} - overline{AD} and overline{BC} - These are the only parallel edges in this face, giving us 2 pairs of parallel edges for the base dimension. 2. **Extend to All Dimensions**: - The prism has three dimensions, but unlike the cube, the edges are of different lengths. Therefore, the calculation for one dimension cannot be directly multiplied by three. - We consider the vertical faces and the top face: - Vertical faces (front and back) provide another 2 pairs each. - The top face provides 2 pairs of parallel edges. - Adding these, we obtain 2 (base) + 2 (front) + 2 (back) + 2 (top) = 8 pairs of parallel edges. 3. **Calculate Total Pairs**: - The total number of pairs of parallel edges in this rectangular prism is 8.

We need to determine the minimum number of rectangular pieces the paper can be divided into after making vertical cuts through the holes, where the cuts stop at the horizontal sides of the adjacent holes or the edge of the paper. 2. **Analogy and Step-by-Step Decomposition**: Let's begin by drawing a vertical cut along each hole, stopping at the horizontal side of the nearest hole or the edge of the paper. Repeat this process for all n holes (left illustration in the reference solution). This method effectively slices the paper into smaller rectangular sections. 3. **Corners Count Analysis**: Each resulting rectangular section from the cuts will have 4 corners. Thus, the total number of corners for all resulting rectangles can be expressed as 4m, where m is the number of rectangular sections. 4. **Estimation**: - The original rectangular piece has 4 corners. - Each vertical cut (resulting from passing along each side of a hole adding more lines) potentially increases the number of right angles/corners. Given each hole interacts with cuts horizontally and vertically, it provides new angles, creating up to 6 new corners per cut. 5. **Upper Bound Calculation**: Each of the 2n cuts (since each hole can be approached from two sides, albeit with overlaps) can add no more than 6 corners: [ 4 text{ (original corners)} + 2n cdot 6 = 4 + 12n ] Since these 12n corners include overlaps, this formula provides the upper bound of maximum number of corners created by the cuts, inclusively. 6. **Combining Inequalities and Simplifying**: Knowing 4m leq 12n + 4 from above analysis: [ 4m leq 12n + 4 implies m leq 3n + 1 ] 7. **Proof of Sufficiency**: To demonstrate 3n+1 is a minimal value and achievable, consider arranging the holes such that: - Holes are of successively increasing heights (right illustration in the reference solution). - Each strategic cut partitions the paper over different sections in every possibility of configuration ensuring no fewer sections than 3n+1. **Conclusion**: By logical deduction and bounding, we assure that the resulting sections cannot be fewer than 3n+1.

Let’s denote this prime number by (p): [ p = A cdot a + B cdot b + C cdot c ] 3.

We denote by l the image of the line l_2 under this rotation. 3. **Effect of rotation**: Under this rotation, any line l_2 passing through M will be rotated by alpha. The new angle that the rotated line l (originally l_2) makes with the original position of l_2 is alpha. Thus, the rotated line l will intersect the original line l_2 at the angle alpha, which is the same as the angle between l_1 and l_2. 4. **Parallelism**: The crucial observation here is that l_1 and the rotated line l both intersect l_2 at the same angle alpha. Since the angle between l_1 and l_2 is the same as the angle between l and l_2, this implies that l_1 and l are parallel. To see why, consider the following reasoning: - The intersection angle between l_2 and l_1 is alpha. - The intersection angle between l_2 and the rotated line l is also alpha. - Since the angles are congruent and they both share a common intersecting line l_2, the line l must be parallel to l_1. 5. **Conclusion**: Hence, upon rotating one of the lines (l_2) by the angle alpha, the rotated line (l) becomes parallel to the other line (l_1).

Substituting these approximations, we get: [ (a+b) left(1 - epsilon ln(a+b)right) geq a left(1 - epsilon ln(a)right) + b ] 12. Simplifying, we get: [ a + b - epsilon (a+b) ln(a+b) geq a - epsilon a ln(a) + b ] 13. Canceling a + b from both sides, we get: [ -epsilon (a+b) ln(a+b) geq -epsilon a ln(a) ] 14.

This is because if we set x'=2-x, then x=2-x', and substituting back into the equation gives us f(x')=f(2-x'), which is the original property. Therefore, statement B is correct, as it states x=1 is the axis of symmetry for y=f(x). Furthermore, given that f(3x+2) is an odd function, we have f(3x+2)=-f(-3x-2). Letting t=3x, we get f(t+2)=-f(-t-2). By substituting t=-x and t=x, we find that f(-x+2)=-f(x+2). This implies that the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (2,0), leading to the conclusion that f(2)=0. Since f(2-x)=f(x), we have f(0)=f(2)=0, which confirms that statement C is correct. The periodicity of f(x) can be deduced from the given properties. Since f(x+2)=-f(x), we see that f(x) must repeat its values in cycles of 4 units.

When embroidering flowers, she can sew 4 stitches/minute, but when embroidering unicorns, she can sew 5 stitches/minute, and when embroidering Godzilla, she can sew 3 stitches/minute. A flower takes 60 stitches to embroider, a unicorn takes 180 stitches, and Godzilla takes 800 stitches. If Carolyn wants to embroider Godzilla crushing 3 unicorns and 50 flowers, and she takes a 5minute break after every 30 minutes of embroidering, how many total minutes does she need to spend (including breaks) to complete her embroidering project?","completion":"First, let's calculate the time Carolyn needs to embroider each type of figure without breaks. For flowers: - Each flower takes 60 stitches. - She can sew 4 stitches per minute. - So, each flower takes 60 stitches / 4 stitches per minute = 15 minutes to embroider. For unicorns: - Each unicorn takes 180 stitches. - She can sew 5 stitches per minute. - So, each unicorn takes 180 stitches / 5 stitches per minute = 36 minutes to embroider. For Godzilla: - Godzilla takes 800 stitches. - She can sew 3 stitches per minute. - So, Godzilla takes 800 stitches / 3 stitches per minute = 266.67 minutes to embroider. We'll round this up to the nearest minute, so 267 minutes. Now, let's calculate the total time for each type of figure without breaks. - For 50 flowers: 50 flowers * 15 minutes per flower = 750 minutes. - For 3 unicorns: 3 unicorns * 36 minutes per unicorn = 108 minutes. - For Godzilla: 1 Godzilla * 267 minutes = 267 minutes. Now, let's add up the total time for all figures without breaks: 750 minutes (flowers) + 108 minutes (unicorns) + 267 minutes (Godzilla) = 1125 minutes. Next, we need to calculate the number of breaks Carolyn will take. She takes a 5-minute break after every 30 minutes of embroidering. To find out how many breaks she will take, we divide the total embroidering time by 30 minutes. 1125 minutes / 30 minutes = 37.5. Since she can't take half a break, we'll round this down to 37 breaks. After the 37th break, she will have 15 minutes of embroidering left (since 1125 is 15 minutes more than 1110, which is 37 * 30). Now, let's calculate the total break time: 37 breaks * 5 minutes per break = 185 minutes. Finally, let's add the total embroidering time and the total break time to find the total time Carolyn needs to spend on her project: 1125 minutes (embroidering) + 185 minutes (breaks) = 1310 minutes. So, Carolyn needs to spend boxed{1310} minutes in total, including breaks, to complete her embroidering project."},{"prompt":"On a square table lies a round plate.

Let the radius of the plate be ( r ). Given the table's symmetry and the arrangement of distances, we recognize that the sum of distances from the edge of the plate to both sides of the table in any direction will include the diameter of the plate: [ 10 + 63 + 2r = 20 + text{unknown distance} + 2r ] 4.

Prove that one of the checkers is located on the diagonal.","completion":"1. Let's denote the (25 times 25) chessboard with coordinates ranging from ((1,1)) to ((25,25)). 2. The main diagonal of the board consists of the cells ((i, i)) for (i) ranging from 1 to 25. 3. Assume that the placement of the 25 checkers is symmetric with respect to this diagonal, meaning if there is a checker at ((i, j)), there is also a checker at ((j, i)). Now consider the following argument: 1. Any checker that is not on the diagonal must have a corresponding checker in a symmetric position relative to the diagonal. 2. Therefore, for every checker at position ((i, j)) with (i neq j), there is a matching checker at position ((j, i)). 3. This symmetric pairing implies that the number of checkers not on the diagonal must be even because they form pairs. 4. The total number of checkers is given as 25, which is an odd number. 5. If all 25 checkers were not on the diagonal, then there would be an even number of checkers (since they pair up symmetrically), which contradicts the given total of 25 checkers. Thus, using the pigeonhole principle, since an odd number of checkers cannot be completely paired up symmetrically, at least one checker must be on the diagonal. # Conclusion: Hence, there must be at least one checker located on the diagonal of a (25 times 25) chessboard. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Construct a triangle given the side length a and the angle alpha opposite to it, knowing that the angle bisector of alpha forms a 45^{circ} angle with the side a.","completion":"Given data: - A triangle with a known side (a) and the angle (alpha) opposite to (a). - The angle bisector of (alpha) forms a (45^circ) angle with (a).

Step-by-step Analysis: 1. **Base Case (Single Digit (n)):** - If (n) is a single-digit number, then (m = 1), implying (n) has only one digit. - Clearly, (n leq 9). - Therefore, [ 2^{a_{1}} cdot 3^{a_{2}} cdot 4^{a_{3}} cdots 10^{a_{9}} = n + 1. ] 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** - Assume the inequality (2^{a_{1}} cdot 3^{a_{2}} cdots 10^{a_{9}} leqslant n + 1) holds true for all ( n ) with ( m leq k), where (m) is the number of digits of (n). 3. **Induction Step:** - Consider an integer ( n ) with ( m = k + 1 ) digits. - Let the first digit of ( n ) be ( r ), then we can express ( n ) as: [ n = r cdot 10^k + n_1 ] where ( n_1 ) is the integer formed by the remaining ( k ) digits of ( n ), and (0 leq n_1 < 10^k ). 4. **Case Analysis for (n_1):** - **Case 1:** ( n_1 = 0 ) - Here, ( a_r = 1 ) and all other (a_i = 0). - Thus, [ (r + 1)^1 leqslant r + 1 < 10 leq r cdot 10^k + 1 = n + 1. ] - **Case 2:** ( 1 leq n_1 leq 10^k - 1) - By the induction hypothesis for ( n_1 ): [ 2^{a_{1}} cdot 3^{a_{2}} cdots (r+1)^{a_{r+1}} cdots 10^{a_{9}} = 2^{a_{1}} cdot 3^{a_{2}} cdots (r+1)^{a_{r}} cdots 10^{a_{9}} leqslant n_1 + 1. ] - Hence, [ (r + 1) cdot 2^{a_{1}} cdot 3^{a_{2}} cdots (r+1)^{a_{r}} cdots 10^{a_{9}} = 2^{a_{1}} cdot 3^{a_{2}} cdots (r+1)^{a_{r+1}} cdots 10^{a_{9}} leq (r + 1) cdot (n_1 + 1). ] - Expanding this, we get, [ (r + 1) cdot (n_1 + 1) = r cdot n_1 + n_1 + r + 1. ] - Since ( r cdot 10^k + n_1 = n ), we have, [ r cdot 10^k + n_1 + r + 1 = n + 1. ] - Thus, this completes the proof by induction for ( m = k + 1 ). # Conclusion: Hence, the inequality ( 2^{a_{1}} cdot 3^{a_{2}} cdot 4^{a_{3}} cdots 10^{a_{9}} leqslant n + 1 ) holds true for any positive integer ( n ).

We show this by induction. Let us assume (a_{n} geq a_{n-1}) for some (n geq 1). Then: [ a_{n+1}^2 = a_n^2 + frac{1}{a_n} ] and since (a_n geq a_{n-1}), we have: [ a_{n+1} = sqrt{a_n^2 + frac{1}{a_n}} > a_n ] by the properties of the square root and positive terms. Thus, by induction, the sequence is increasing: [ a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < cdots < a_n < a_{n+1} < cdots ] 2. **Bounded Differences:** Next, we want to show that the differences a_{n+1} - a_n become smaller than frac{1}{2000} after some index n_0.

If a_n leq 100 for all n, then for each n, we have: [ a_{n+1} - a_n > frac{1}{2 cdot 100 cdot 100} = frac{1}{20000} ] Summing these increments: [ a_{n+1} - a_1 geq frac{n}{20000} ] Therefore, for large n, specifically n geq 2000000, we reach a contradiction because a_n would exceed 100. 5. **Concluding Bound:** Hence, for sufficiently large n, a_n > 100.

This means that for any ( k ) and ( l ), the difference ( a_{ik} - a_{jk} equiv a_{il} - a_{jl} pmod{2022} ). 3. **Consider three rows:** Suppose we have three rows ( mathbf{a}_1, mathbf{a}_2, mathbf{a}_3 ). Define the sums of the differences: [ x = sum_{k=1}^{2022} (a_{3k} - a_{1k}), ] [ y = sum_{k=1}^{2022} (a_{1k} - a_{2k}), ] [ z = sum_{k=1}^{2022} (a_{2k} - a_{3k}). ] 4. **Modulo condition:** By the problem's condition, each of these sums ( x, y, z ) must be congruent to the same value modulo ( 2022 ).

Additionally, if M has another divisor m such that m neq 1 and m neq M, then frac{M}{m} is also a divisor of M. This pair combining property of divisors means M usually has divisors coming in pairs. 2. **Conditions for Exactly Three Divisors**: For M to have exactly three distinct divisors, there must be an additional unique divisor such that m = frac{M}{m}. This implies that m^2 = M. Therefore, M must be a perfect square, specifically M = p^2 where p is some divisor of M. 3. **Prime Number Condition**: We need m (or p) to be a prime number because this guarantees that no other divisors exist apart from 1, p, and p^2. This results from the prime nature of m, leading to three distinct divisors: 1, p (the prime itself), and p^2 (the square of the prime). 4. **Conclusion**: Hence, a number M that has exactly three distinct divisors must be the square of a prime number.

Similarly, for another arithmetic sequence, the sum of the first n terms is T_n = frac{n(b_1 + b_n)}{2}. 2. **Given Condition**: We are given that frac{S_n}{T_n} = frac{n+3}{2n-1}. This relationship is crucial for solving the problem. 3. **Focusing on the Required Terms**: We need to find frac{a_5}{T_9}. To do this, we look at the sum of the first 9 terms of the sequence {a_n}, which is S_9 = frac{9(a_1 + a_9)}{2}. However, we know that in an arithmetic sequence, the middle term (when n is odd) is also the average of the first and last term in the sum, so a_5 = frac{a_1 + a_9}{2}.

Correctly substituting n=9 gives us: [ frac{S_9}{T_9} = frac{9+3}{2 times 9 - 1} = frac{12}{17} ] This is incorrect.

The distance between these points must be less than the length of the interval, which is pi, i.e., |x_{1}-x_{2}| < pi. Furthermore, considering the periodic nature of the cosine function, the distance between two consecutive extreme points is either frac{T}{2} or frac{T}{2}+T, where T is the period of f(x). Thus, we have frac{T}{2} < pi leqslant frac{3T}{2}. **Step 2: Determining the Period T** Since T=frac{2pi}{omega} and omega > 0, we can rearrange the inequality frac{T}{2} < pi leqslant frac{3T}{2} to find the range of T: frac{2pi}{3} leqslant T < 2pi. Substituting T=frac{2pi}{omega} into this inequality gives 1 < omega leqslant 3. As omega is a natural number, omega can only be 2 or 3. **Step 3: Using Symmetry to Find varphi** Given fleft(-frac{2}{3}piright)+fleft(frac{1}{3}piright)=0, we infer the function is symmetric about the midpoint left(-frac{pi}{6},0right). Thus, -frac{pi}{6}omega +varphi =kpi +frac{pi}{2}, where k in mathbb{Z}.

Given varphi in [0,pi], varphi =frac{5pi}{6}. - If omega = 3, then varphi =kpi +frac{pi}{2}+frac{pi}{2} = kpi +pi. Given varphi in [0,pi], varphi =0 or pi. **Conclusion:** The set of all possible values of varphi is left{0,frac{5pi}{6},piright}.

Given the triangle ( triangle ABC ) with right angle ( angle C = 90^circ ), point ( A ) lies on the positive x-axis, and point ( B ) lies on the positive y-axis. 2. Denote the lengths of ( AC ) and ( BC ) as ( b ) and ( a ) respectively. Since ( C ) is the right-angled vertex, by definition of the coordinates we get: - ( A(a, 0) ) - ( B(0, b) ) 3. The coordinates of ( C ) can be found using the perpendicular distance relations: - From the Pythagorean theorem for right triangle, the length ( AB ) (hypotenuse) is given by: [ c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ] 4. To find the equation of the locus of point ( C ): - Since ( C ) lies on the line segment connecting ( A ) and ( B ), it must satisfy the line equation passing through ( A ) and ( B ). 5. The slope of the line passing through ( A ) and ( B ) is: [ m = frac{b - 0}{0 - a} = -frac{b}{a} ] 6. The point-slope form of the line equation for line ( AB ) is: [ y - 0 = -frac{b}{a}(x - a) ] Simplifying, we get: [ y = -frac{b}{a}(x - a) ] [ y = -frac{b}{a}x + b ] Thus, the equation of the line ( AB ) can be rewritten as: [ y = frac{b}{a}x ] 7. Points ( A ), ( B ) and the origin ( O ) form a cyclic quadrilateral since the angle between line segments ( OA ) and ( OB ) is 90 degrees each, leading to their sum being 180 degrees. Thus the four points ( O, A, B, C ) are concyclic. 8.

Let's perform the prime factorization of ( n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5 ). If the condition in the problem can be satisfied, then every prime factor must appear in at least two of these six numbers. 3. Therefore, there must be a prime ( p ) that divides at least two of the numbers in ( n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5 ).

(1) Find the standard equation of parabola C; (2) Suppose that line l is the directrix of the parabola. Prove that the circle with diameter AB is tangent to the directrix l.","completion":"(1) Since the vertex of the parabola C is at the origin (0,0) and it passes through the point A(2,2), the axis of the parabola is parallel to either the x-axis or the y-axis. Also, since the focus F is on the x-axis, the parabola opens to the right. The standard form of the parabola's equation is y^2 = 4ax, where a is the distance from the vertex to the focus. Given that the parabola passes through point A(2,2), we plug in the coordinates into the equation, getting 2^2 = 4a cdot 2. Simplifying, we have 4 = 8a, which gives us a = frac{1}{2}. Thus, the standard equation of parabola C is y^2 = 4 cdot frac{1}{2}x, which simplifies to y^2 = 2x. So the correct equation is: y^2 = 2x (2) For a parabola with a focus at (a, 0) and the directrix being the line x = -a, the distance from the focus to the vertex is a and, consequently, the distance from the vertex to the directrix is also a. From part (1), we found that a = frac{1}{2} for our parabola. The equation of the directrix l can be written as x = -frac{1}{2} since it's the same distance from the vertex as the focus, but in the opposite direction. Because the parabola is symmetric with respect to its axis, the point B(2,-2) is also on parabola C. Now, let's consider the circle with diameter AB. The center of this circle, M, is the midpoint of AB, which is at (frac{A_x + B_x}{2}, frac{A_y + B_y}{2}) = (frac{2+2}{2}, frac{2-2}{2}) = (2,0). The radius of the circle is half the length of AB, which is the distance from A to B divided by 2. Thus, the radius r is: r = frac{sqrt{(B_x - A_x)^2 + (B_y - A_y)^2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{(2 - 2)^2 + (-2 - 2)^2}}{2} = frac{sqrt{0 + 16}}{2} = 2 Now we calculate the distance from the center of the circle M to the directrix l: d = |x_M - (-a)| = |2 - (-frac{1}{2})| = 2 + frac{1}{2} = frac{5}{2} To show that the circle is tangent to the directrix l, we must prove that this distance d is equal to the radius r of the circle. However, we just calculated that r = 2 and d = frac{5}{2}, which means the distance from the center of the circle to the directrix is greater than the radius. There appears to be a discrepancy as this would mean the circle does not touch the directrix l. We must re-evaluate our assumption about the directrix or the calculations. Upon revisiting our steps, we realize that in a parabola, the directrix is equidistant from the vertex as the focus, but on the opposite side. With the focus at (frac{1}{2},0), the directrix is actually the line x = -frac{1}{2}. Thus, the actual distance from the center of the circle (which is also the vertex of the parabola) to the directrix should be: d = |x_M - (-a)| = |2 - (-frac{1}{2})| = 2 + frac{1}{2} = 2.5 It appears that there has been an error in the interpretation of the circle's tangent to the directrix. Typically, in problems like this, the circle with diameter AB should indeed be tangent to the directrix. However, based on the values found, the distance from M to the directrix exceeds the radius, suggesting tangency fails under these conditions. Let's try another approach and reassess the position of B. The circle's center is at (2, 0), and so the distance from the center M of the circle to the directrix l is half the length of the parabole's lattice rectum, which is 2a, where a is the distance from the vertex to the focus. d_M = |x_M - x_{l}| = |2 - (-frac{1}{2})| = 2 + frac{1}{2} = 2.5 However, the lattice rectum (full length of the parabola's segment perpendicular to the axis and passing through the focus) for this parabola is 4a, so half of this would indeed be 2a = 2 cdot frac{1}{2} = 1, meaning the radius of the circle is equal to the distance from M to the directrix.

Denote the incircle of ( triangle ABC ) as ( omega ), which is tangent to the sides ( AC ) and ( AB ) at points ( P ) and ( Q ) respectively, such that the segment ( PQ ) is tangent to ( omega ). **Step 2: Identifying tangent points** The points ( K, L, ) and ( M ) are defined as the points of tangency of ( omega ) with the segments ( BQ, QP, ) and ( PC ), respectively. By the symmetry of the equilateral triangle, we know that the lines ( BO ) and ( CO ) will pass through points ( M ) and ( K ) respectively. **Step 3: Constructing point ( X ) on ( Omega )** Next, extend the line ( LO ) and place a point ( X ) such that ( OX = OA ). This means that ( X ) lies on ( Omega ), the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ). Since ( PL ) and ( PM ) are tangent to ( omega ), we have: [ angle POL = angle POM implies angle POB = angle POX ] **Step 4: Proving similarity of triangles** We need to prove the congruence of the triangles ( triangle POB ) and ( triangle POX ). We know: - ( OB = OX ) - ( OP ) is common - ( angle POB = angle POX ) Hence, by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion, the triangles ( triangle POB ) and ( triangle POX ) are congruent, leading to ( PX = PB ). This implies that the point ( X ) lies on ( Omega_b ). **Step 5: Symmetric consideration for ( Omega_c )** By a similar argument, considering the other circle ( Omega_c ) which has center ( Q ) and passes through ( C ), we can show ( triangle QOC ) is congruent to ( triangle QOX ), leading to ( QX = QC ). Hence, the point ( X ) also lies on ( Omega_c ). **Conclusion** Since the point ( X ) lies on ( Omega ), ( Omega_b ), and ( Omega_c ), it follows that these three circles have the point ( X ) in common, proving the statement. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the set A={x|(x^2+ax+b)(x1)=0}, and set B satisfies the condition: Acap B={1,2}, Acap (Ccup B)={3}, where U=mathbb{R}, find the value of a+b.","completion":"- **Key Point:** Mixed operations of intersection, union, and complement sets. - **Topic:** Investigative. - **Analysis:** First, determine the elements of set A based on the conditions Acap B={1,2} and Acap (Ccup B)={3}, then substitute into the equation to solve for a and b. - Since Acap B={1,2}, it means 1in A and 2in A.

The sales tax can be calculated as: Sales Tax = 10% of C Sales Tax = 0.10 * 555.56 Sales Tax = 55.56 (rounded to two decimal places) So, the total cost including the sales tax is: Total Cost with Tax = C + Sales Tax Total Cost with Tax = 555.56 + 55.56 Total Cost with Tax = 611.12 (rounded to two decimal places) Finally, we add the 25 shipping fee to find the total original cost: Total Original Cost = Total Cost with Tax + Shipping Fee Total Original Cost = 611.12 + 25 Total Original Cost = 636.12 Therefore, the statue originally cost Jim boxed{636.12,} including the taxes and shipping fee."},{"prompt":"Simplify the expression to a common fraction: frac{1}{frac{1}{(frac{1}{2})^{0}}+frac{1}{(frac{1}{2})^{1}}+frac{1}{(frac{1}{2})^{2}}+frac{1}{(frac{1}{2})^{3}}}","completion":"First, simplify each term in the denominator: - frac{1}{(frac{1}{2})^{0}} = frac{1}{1} = 1 - frac{1}{(frac{1}{2})^{1}} = frac{1}{frac{1}{2}} = 2 - frac{1}{(frac{1}{2})^{2}} = frac{1}{frac{1}{4}} = 4 - frac{1}{(frac{1}{2})^{3}} = frac{1}{frac{1}{8}} = 8 Sum these values: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 The expression simplifies to: frac{1}{15} Conclude with: boxed{frac{1}{15}}"},{"prompt":"Jerry and Beth each drove from Smallville to Crown City by different routes.

Since he drove for 30 minutes at an average speed of 40 miles per hour, we need to convert the time to hours to match the units of speed. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour). Now, we can calculate the distance Jerry traveled: Distance = Speed × Time Distance (Jerry) = 40 mph × 0.5 hours = 20 miles Now let's find out how long Beth took to complete her trip. Since it took her 20 minutes more than Jerry, she took 30 minutes + 20 minutes = 50 minutes. Convert that to hours: 50 minutes is 50/60 hours, which simplifies to 5/6 hours. Now we can calculate the distance Beth traveled: Distance (Beth) = Speed (Beth) × Time (Beth) Distance (Beth) = 30 mph × (5/6) hours To simplify the calculation, we can convert 5/6 hours to a decimal: 5/6 hours = 0.8333... hours (approximately) Now, calculate Beth's distance: Distance (Beth) ≈ 30 mph × 0.8333 hours ≈ 24.999 miles, which we can round to 25 miles for simplicity.

Therefore, for k=3, the function intersects the x-axis. **Case 2: When kneq 3** 1. For kneq 3, the function y=left(k-3right)x^{2}+2x+1 is a quadratic function. 2. A quadratic function intersects the x-axis if and only if its discriminant b^{2}-4acgeqslant 0. 3. For the given function, a=k-3, b=2, and c=1. Substituting these values into the discriminant formula gives b^{2}-4ac = 2^{2}-4(k-3) = 4-4k+12 = 16-4k. 4. Setting the discriminant greater than or equal to zero, we have 16-4kgeqslant 0. 5. Solving for k, we find -4kgeqslant -16, which simplifies to kleqslant 4. **Combining Cases 1 and 2:** - From Case 1, we have k=3 as a valid value. - From Case 2, we found that kleqslant 4 for the quadratic function to intersect the x-axis, which includes k=3 as a possibility but extends to all k values less than or equal to 4. Therefore, combining both cases, we conclude that the range of values for k for which the function intersects the x-axis is kleqslant 4.

Spinach sales: The sales of spinach are 16 more than half of the sales of carrots.

Assume the intersections of these bisectors as follows: - (l_A cap l_B = K) - (l_B cap l_C = L) - (l_C cap l_D = M) - (l_D cap l_A = N) Next, we'll show that if the circumcircles of (triangle ABK) and (triangle CDM) touch each other externally, then the circumcircles of (triangle BCL) and (triangle DAN) will also touch each other externally. 1. **Defining Intersection Point (P)**: Let the extensions of sides (BC) and (AD) intersect at a point (P). For definiteness, assume (P) lies on the extension of side (BC) beyond point (B). 2. **Identifying Centers of Excircles**: Since (K) is the intersection of the external angle bisectors (l_A) and (l_B) for (triangle APB), (K) is the center of the excircle of (triangle APB). Similarly, (M) is the center of the excircle of (triangle CPD). 3. **Linear Alignment of Points**: Therefore, points (P), (K), and (M) lie on the same line (m), which is the line that contains the bisector of angle (CPD). 4. **Touching Circumcircles Externaly**: Suppose line (m) intersects the circumcircle of (triangle ABK) again at point (K') (distinct from (K)). Denote (angle APB = alpha). Then: [ angle AKB = 90^circ + frac{alpha}{2} ] Thus, the angle ( angle AK'B ) (because ( K' ) lies on the circumcircle) is: [ angle AK'B = 180^circ - left(90^circ + frac{alpha}{2}right) = 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2} ] Since (K) is also the intersection of the external angle bisectors of (triangle APB), it implies that ( K' ) coincides with ( K ). Hence, the center (O_1) of the circumcircle of (triangle ABK) lies on line (m). 5. **Verifying the Other Circumcircle**: Similarly, the center (O_2) of the circumcircle of (triangle CDM) also lies on line (m). If the circumcircles of (triangle ABK) and (triangle CDM) touch externally at point (I) on line (m), then (I) is also: - The intersection of the internal bisectors of (angle C) and (angle D), - The center of a common excircle (because it's an inscribed quadrilateral). Thus, if two circumcircles touch externally, then the quadrilateral (ABCD) must be a cyclic quadrilateral, and (I) lies at the intersection point of any of the internal bisectors. 6. **Converse Argument**: Conversely, if (ABCD) is a cyclic quadrilateral and (I) is the common point on line (m): - Then it must lie on the circumcircle touching points. - Subsequently, the circumcircles of (triangle BCL) and (triangle DAN) will also touch externally. # Conclusion: [ boxed{ text{If the circumcircles of } triangle ABK text{ and } triangle CDM text{ touch externally, then the same applies for } triangle BCL text{ and } triangle DAN. } ]"},{"prompt":"6 barrels of water have an average capacity of 12 gallons.

We know that the average capacity is 12 gallons, so the total capacity of all barrels is 6 * 12 = 72 gallons. We are also given that the median is 14 gallons. Since we have an even number of barrels, the median will be the average of the capacities of the third and fourth barrels (C and D). Therefore, (C + D) / 2 = 14, which implies C + D = 28 gallons. The capacity of the largest barrel (F) is a prime number. The prime numbers between 8 and 16 are 11, 13, and 17. However, 17 is not within the given range, so F must be either 11 or 13 gallons. To maximize the capacity of the smallest barrel (A), we should minimize the capacities of the other barrels. Since the median is 14, we can set C and D to be as close to 14 as possible within the given range. Let's set C = 14 and D = 14 (since the median is the average of C and D). This leaves us with 72 - 28 = 44 gallons for A, B, E, and F. Now, let's choose the largest possible prime number for F that is within the range and less than or equal to 16. The prime numbers less than 16 are 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, and 2. Since we want the largest barrel to be a prime number, we'll choose 13 for F. This leaves us with 44 - 13 = 31 gallons for A, B, and E.

Since he spends 8 hours on his phone every day, we multiply 8 hours by 7 days: 8 hours/day * 7 days/week = 56 hours/week Now, we know that he spends 28 hours on social media in a week. To find the ratio of the time spent on social media to the total time spent on his phone daily, we need to compare the daily average time spent on social media to the daily phone usage. To find the daily average time spent on social media, we divide the weekly social media time by 7 days: 28 hours/week / 7 days/week = 4 hours/day Now we have the daily social media time (4 hours) and the daily phone usage time (8 hours). The ratio of the time spent on social media to the total time spent on his phone daily is: 4 hours (social media) : 8 hours (total phone usage) To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by the common factor of 4: (4 hours / 4) : (8 hours / 4) = 1 : 2 So, the ratio of the time spent on social media to the total time spent on his phone daily is boxed{1:2} ."},{"prompt":"Given the function ( f(x) = ax^2 + 8x + 3 ) where ( a < 0 ).

We need to show that there exists a specific power ( T ) such that if ( p ) divides any element of the sequence, the power to which ( p ) divides that element is exactly ( p^T ). To begin, we observe that the indices ( k ) of terms divisible by ( p ) form an arithmetic sequence: say they are ( kappa, kappa + lambda, kappa + 2lambda, ldots ). Here, ( lambda ) is related to the order of ( frac{a}{b} ) modulo ( p ). This implies we need [ nu_p left( c a^{kappa + nlambda} - d b^{kappa + nlambda} right) = nu_p left( left( frac{a^lambda}{b^lambda} right)^n - frac{d a^kappa}{c b^kappa} right) ] to be constant. By identifying the pattern, we reduce the problem to a more general proposition about ( p )-adic valuations: **Proposition:** Let ( p ) be an odd prime, and let ( x, y in mathbb{Q}_{>0} ) such that ( x equiv y equiv 1 pmod{p} ). If the sequence ( nu_p left( x^n - y right) ) of positive integers is non-constant, then it is unbounded. **Claim:** Let ( p ) be an odd prime, and let ( x, y in mathbb{Q}_{>0} ) such that ( x equiv y equiv 1 pmod{p} ). Suppose ( m ) and ( n ) are positive integers such that: [ d = nu_p left( x^n - y right) < nu_p left( x^m - y right) = e. ] Then there exists an integer ( ell ) such that ( nu_p left( x^ell - y right) ge e + 1 ). **Proof:** 1. Firstly, note that: [ nu_p left( x^m - x^n right) = nu_p left( left( x^m - y right) - left( x^n - y right) right) = d. ] 2. By Hensel’s Lemma, or the ( p )-adic lifting lemma, there exists some ( k ) such that: [ nu_p left( x^k - 1 right) = e, ] where ( k = p^{e-d} gcd(m-n, p^infty) ). Essentially, ( k = p^{e-d} |m - n| ). 3. Set ( x^k = p^e u + 1 ) and ( x^m = p^e v + y ) for rational ( u, v ) not divisible by ( p ). 4. For any integer ( 1 leq r leq p - 1 ), we consider: [ x^{kr+m} - y = left(p^e u + 1right)^r left( p^e v + y right) - y .] 5. Expanding the above expression, we get: [ x^{kr+m} - y = p^e (ruv + vy) + p^{2e} (ldots). ] 6. By choosing ( r ) such that ( ru equiv -v pmod{p} ), we ensure: [ p^{e+1} mid x^{kr+m} - y. ] Thus, ( ell = kr + m ) is an integer satisfying: [ nu_p left( x^ell - y right) geq e + 1. ] This completes the proof. Hence, we conclude that there exists a power ( T ) such that whenever ( p ) divides an element of the sequence ( c a^k - d b^k ), the maximum power of ( p ) dividing that element is exactly ( p^T ).

If it did not, the remaining space on either side horizontally would be less than 2n each, which leaves no space for the two required horizontal 2n times 1 rectangles. 2. **Rectangles Touching Corners:** - From the above, it follows that any 1 times 2n rectangle must touch a corner of the garden. - Similarly, by analogous reasoning, any horizontal 2n times 1 rectangle must touch a corner of the garden. 3. **Placement Patterns:** - Considering the symmetry and the placement requirement above, these largest rectangles will form an edge framework around the garden. - There are exactly two patterns to place these longest rectangles around the garden, as shown in the reference image: either placing the vertical rectangles on the left and right and the horizontal rectangles on the top and bottom, or vice versa. 4. **Remaining Garden Structure:** - After placing the largest rectangles, we are left with the central (2n-1) times (2n-1) square garden. - This new smaller garden must also be divided in the same manner with rectangles 1 times k and k times 1, where k now ranges up to 2(n-1) + 1. 5. **Induction Proof:** - **Base Case (Induction Anchoring):** - For ( n = 1 ), the garden is 3 times 3.

Adding these equations, we get 2n + 12 = 2044, leading to n = 1016. - For 3 cdot 681, we have n + m + 6 = 681 and n - m + 6 = 3. Adding these equations, we get 2n + 12 = 684, leading to n = 336. - For 227 cdot 9, we have n + m + 6 = 227 and n - m + 6 = 9. Adding these equations, we get 2n + 12 = 236, leading to n = 112. 5. **Summing the values of n**: Adding up all the values of n we found, we get: [1016 + 336 + 112 = 1464] 6. **Finding the remainder when divided by 1000**: The remainder when 1464 is divided by 1000 is 464.

Specifically, we have: 1. i^{2}=-1, which implies that squaring i results in -1. 2. i^{3}=i cdot i^{2} = i cdot (-1) = -i, showing that raising i to the power of 3 gives -i. 3. i^{4}=(i^{2})^{2}=(-1)^{2}=1, indicating that i to the power of 4 equals 1. Given these properties, we can analyze the expression x=i^{n}+i^{-n} for different values of n in the natural numbers N: - When n=4k (kin N), we have x=i^{4k}+i^{-4k}=1+1=2 because i^{4k} and i^{-4k} both equal 1. - When n=4k+1 (kin N), x=i^{4k+1}+i^{-4k-1}=i cdot i^{4k} + frac{1}{i} cdot i^{-4k}=i + frac{1}{i}=i - i=0, since i^{4k}=1 and frac{1}{i}=-i. - Similarly, for n=4k+2 (kin N), x=i^{4k+2}+i^{-4k-2}=i^{2} cdot i^{4k} + frac{1}{i^{2}} cdot i^{-4k}=-1 + (-1)=-2, as i^{2}=-1. - And for n=4k+3 (kin N), x=i^{4k+3}+i^{-4k-3}=i^{3} cdot i^{4k} + frac{1}{i^{3}} cdot i^{-4k}=-i + i=0, since i^{3}=-i.

Petya must mark at least one of the cells (A) or (G) in each set of 7 consecutive cells.

Hence, the number of valid (difference) sequences of length (n-1) (or (99) when (n=100)) can be represented by: [ 3^{n-1} ] For (n=100): [ 3^{99} ] 2. **Counting Sequences without the Number '3':** We now count the sequences that only consist of the numbers ({1, 2}), as any such sequence will not include the number '3'.

This gives us 3 times 4 = 12 additional lines since we can do this for each combination of 1 point on the line and 1 point off the line. 3. Finally, we consider the 4 points that are not collinear. Since no three of them are on the same line, every pair of points gives us a unique line. The number of ways we can pick 2 points from these 4 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), which in this case is C(4, 2). This yields frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6 lines.

So, we have: A2 - A1 = 933.4285714285714 Substituting the area formulas, we get: πr2^2 - πr1^2 = 933.4285714285714 We can factor out π from both terms on the left side: π(r2^2 - r1^2) = 933.4285714285714 Now, we can divide both sides by π to isolate the term (r2^2 - r1^2): r2^2 - r1^2 = 933.4285714285714 / π We know r1 = 12 m, so we can substitute that in: r2^2 - 12^2 = 933.4285714285714 / π r2^2 - 144 = 933.4285714285714 / π Now, we need to add 144 to both sides to solve for r2^2: r2^2 = 933.4285714285714 / π + 144 To find r2, we take the square root of both sides: r2 = √(933.4285714285714 / π + 144) Let's calculate the value of r2 using the approximation π ≈ 3.14159: r2 = √(933.4285714285714 / 3.14159 + 144) r2 = √(297.0707070707071 + 144) r2 = √(441.0707070707071) r2 ≈ 21 So, the new length of the rope is approximately boxed{21} meters."},{"prompt":"the plane coordinate system, an invisible flea is jumping on the lattice points.

Is there a method by which we can surely kill the flea in a finite number of steps?","completion":"Let's restate and interpret the problem: We have an invisible flea jumping on the lattice points of a plane coordinate system. The flea starts from the origin and moves to a neighboring lattice point either to the right or upward. After each jump, we place lethal flea poison on any lattice point of our choice. If the flea lands on a poisoned point or jumps into one later, it dies. Is there a method that ensures the flea will be killed within a finite number of jumps? We can approach this problem by examining the steps the flea can take and how we place the poison. 1. **Define the Sets R_n and m_n:** - Let ( R_{n} ) be the set of lattice points ((x, y)) such that ( x + y = n ). - During the ( n )-th jump, the flea lands on one of the ( n+1 ) points in ( R_{n} ). - Let ( m_{n} ) be the number of points in ( R_{n} ) that we poison by the ( n )-th jump. Since we poison ( n ) points within the first ( n ) steps, it follows that: [ m_{1} + m_{2} + ldots + m_{n} leq n ] 2. **Define h_n and Prove the Inequality:** - Let ( h_{n} ) be the number of points in ( R_{n} ) where the flea can reach. This number is not necessarily equal to the number of unpoisoned points because the poison could block potential paths to otherwise reachable points. - We need to show that: [ h_{n} geq n + 1 - (m_{1} + m_{2} + ldots + m_{n}) ] 3. **Base Case:** - For ( n=1 ), if ( m_1 = 0 ), the flea can jump to either of the points in ( R_1 ), so ( h_1 = 2 ). - If ( m_1 = 1 ), the flea can still jump to the unpoisoned point, so ( h_1 = 1 ). Therefore, in both cases: [ h_{1} geq 2 - m_1 ] 4. **Inductive Step:** - Assume ( h_{n} geq n + 1 - (m_{1} + ldots + m_{n}) ) holds for some ( n ). - Consider ( n+1 ): the flea can potentially jump to the right or upward. There are at least ( 1 + h_{n} ) such moves possible if we consider all neighbors in ( R_{n} ) and at least one new neighbor in ( R_{n+1} ). 5. **Calculate ( h_{n+1} ):** - Therefore, among the points in ( R_{n+1} ), the number of available moves without landing on poison is at least ( 1 + h_{n} - m_{n+1} ): [ h_{n+1} geq 1 + left( n + 1 - (m_{1} + ldots + m_{n}) right) - m_{n+1} ] - Simplifying, we obtain: [ h_{n+1} geq (n + 2) - (m_{1} + ldots + m_{n+1}) ] 6. **Conclusion of Inductive Proof:** - By induction, we have shown that for all ( n ): [ h_{n} geq n + 1 - (m_{1} + ldots + m_{n}) ] Since ( m_{1} + ldots + m_{n} leq n ), it follows that ( h_{n} geq 1 ) for all ( n ). Therefore, we cannot guarantee that the flea can be killed within ( n ) steps for any ( n ).

By the Erdős–Turán theorem, ( N(S) leq f(k, n) ), where ( f(k, n) ) is the maximum number of edges in a complete ( k )-partite graph on ( n ) vertices (since the adjacency graph does not contain ( K_{k+1} )). 3. **Determine ( k ):** We need to find ( k ). We will show that ( k = 4 ). Consider the vectors: [ mathbf{v}_1 = (1+epsilon, 0), quad mathbf{v}_2 = (0, 1-epsilon), quad mathbf{v}_3 = (-1-epsilon, 0), quad mathbf{v}_4 = (0, -1+epsilon) ] These vectors satisfy the desired condition for a small ( epsilon > 0 ). 4. **Contradiction for ( k = 5 ):** Suppose for contradiction that there are 5 vectors where every pair satisfies the inequality. There must be at most 3 vectors with length ( geq 1 ). Otherwise, among the four vectors with length ( geq 1 ), we can find a pair ( mathbf{v}, mathbf{v'} ) whose angles differ by at most ( 90^circ ). For this pair, ( mathbf{v} cdot mathbf{v'} ) and ( (|mathbf{v}|^2-1)(|mathbf{v'}|^2-1) ) are both non-negative, contradicting the inequality. 5. **Similar argument for vectors with length ( leq 1 ):** Similarly, there must be at most 3 vectors with length ( leq 1 ). Since we have a total of 5 vectors, we have exactly 3 vectors of length ( geq 1 ) and 2 vectors of length ( leq 1 ) or vice versa. Our argument applies to either case equally well, so we assume the former scenario. 6. **Lemma and its proof:** **Lemma:** Suppose ( mathbf{u}_1, mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{v}_2, mathbf{u}_2 ) are four vectors in clockwise position such that ( |mathbf{u}_i| geq 1 geq |mathbf{v}_i| ). Suppose further that the desired inequality holds for every pair of these vectors. Let ( alpha, beta, gamma ) be the angles between ( mathbf{u}_1 ) and ( mathbf{v}_1 ), between ( mathbf{v}_1 ) and ( mathbf{v}_2 ), and between ( mathbf{v}_2 ) and ( mathbf{u}_2 ) respectively. Then either ( alpha + beta > 180^circ ) or ( beta + gamma > 180^circ ), but not both. **Proof:** Let ( l_1, s_1, s_2, l_2 ) denote the lengths of ( mathbf{u}_1, mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{v}_2, mathbf{u}_2 ). Applying the condition to ( mathbf{u}_1, mathbf{v}_1 ), we have: [ (l_1^2 - 1)(1 - s_1^2) > 4l_1s_1 cos alpha. ] Similarly, for ( mathbf{u}_2, mathbf{v}_2 ): [ (l_2^2 - 1)(1 - s_2^2) > 4l_2s_2 cos gamma. ] For ( mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{v}_2 ): [ (1 - s_1^2)(1 - s_2^2) < -4s_1s_2 cos beta. ] For ( mathbf{u}_1, mathbf{u}_2 ): [ (l_1^2 - 1)(l_2^2 - 1) < -4l_1l_2 cos (alpha + beta + gamma). ] Multiplying the first two inequalities and comparing to the product of the last two inequalities, we get: [ cos alpha cdot cos gamma < cos beta cdot cos (alpha + beta + gamma). ] Basic trigonometric manipulation gives: [ cos (alpha - gamma) < cos (alpha + 2beta + gamma), ] which yields: [ sin (alpha + beta) cdot sin (beta + gamma) < 0. ] Hence the result. 7. **Application of the lemma:** We have three vectors ( mathbf{u}_1, mathbf{u}_2, mathbf{u}_3 ) (in clockwise position) with length ( geq 1 ) and two vectors ( mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{v}_2 ) with length ( leq 1 ). By condition, the angles between ( mathbf{u}_i ) and ( mathbf{u}_j ) are greater than ( 90^circ ). Thus, the clockwise angle from ( mathbf{u}_i ) to ( mathbf{u}_{i+1} ) is less than ( 180^circ ). By the lemma, ( mathbf{v}_1 ) and ( mathbf{v}_2 ) cannot both lie between ( mathbf{u}_i ) and ( mathbf{u}_{i+1} ). Without loss, assume ( mathbf{v}_1 ) lies between ( mathbf{u}_2 ) and ( mathbf{u}_3 ), while ( mathbf{v}_2 ) lies between ( mathbf{u}_3 ) and ( mathbf{u}_1 ). 8. **Final contradiction:** By the lemma, either the clockwise angle from ( mathbf{u}_2 ) to ( mathbf{v}_2 ) or the clockwise angle from ( mathbf{v}_1 ) to ( mathbf{u}_1 ) is less than ( 180^circ ). Without loss, assume the latter. Then we have four vectors ( mathbf{v}_1, mathbf{u}_3, mathbf{v}_2, mathbf{u}_1 ) in clockwise position and also contained in a half-plane. This situation can be ruled out following the proof of the lemma. Specifically, let ( alpha, beta, gamma ) be the clockwise angles. The condition implies: [ cos alpha cdot cos gamma < cos (alpha + beta) cdot cos (beta + gamma), ] which simplifies to: [ cos (alpha + gamma) < cos (alpha + 2beta + gamma), ] leading to: [ sin beta cdot sin (alpha + beta + gamma) < 0. ] This contradicts our observation that ( alpha + beta + gamma < 180^circ ).

To prove this, we need to demonstrate: 1. (frac{1}{k} (k neq m)), 2. (frac{1}{k} ) (when ( k > 1 ) and ( k mid m )), 3. (frac{1}{k} ) (when ( k, l in mathbb{N}, k > l > 1 ), and ( (k, l) = 1 )) are not the smallest positive periods of ( h(x) ). Let's prove these statements one by one: 1. Assume ( frac{1}{k} (k neq m) ) is the smallest positive period of ( h(x) ), then the multiple of ( frac{1}{k} ), i.e., ( frac{1}{m} ), should also be a period of ( h(x) ). From the function ( f(x) = h(x) - g(x) ), we know (frac{1}{m} ) is a period of ( f(x) ), which contradicts ( T_1 = 1 ). Hence, ( frac{1}{k} ) (when ( k neq m)) can't be the smallest positive period of ( h(x) ). 2. Assume ( frac{1}{k} ) (where ( k > 1 ) and ( k mid m )) is the smallest positive period of ( h(x) ). Since ( k mid m ), we can set ( m = k cdot l ) (( l in mathbb{N} )), then ( frac{1}{k} = frac{l}{m} ). Since ( frac{1}{k} = frac{l}{m} ) is a period of ( h(x) ), and ( frac{l}{m} ) is a period of ( g(x) ), from ( f(x) = h(x) - g(x) ), we know ( frac{1}{k} = frac{l}{m} ) is a period of ( f(x) ), which contradicts ( T_1 = 1 ). Hence, ( frac{1}{k} ) (when ( k mid m )) can't be the smallest positive period of ( h(x) ). 3. Clearly, 1 is a period of ( h(x) ). Since ( 1 div frac{l}{k} = frac{k}{l} ) is not an integer, and according to the theorem, (frac{l}{k} ) can't be the smallest positive period of ( h(x) ). Hence, we have proved this statement. In summary, the conditions mentioned don't match the smallest positive period of ( h(x) ), thus the problem is proved. It's worth noting that ( m ) cannot determine ( k ) uniquely (though the smallest positive period of ( h(x) ) is uniquely determined). For example, if functions ( f(x) = sin(2kpi x) - cos(2mpi x) ), ( g(x) = cos(2mpi x) ), and ( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) = sin(2kpi x) ), where ( m, k in mathbb{N}, m, k > 1 ) and ( (m, k) = 1 ). From earlier examples, we know the smallest positive periods of ( f(x), g(x) ), and ( h(x) ) are 1, ( frac{1}{m} ), and ( frac{1}{k} ) respectively. Given a particular ( m > 1 ), the number of natural numbers ( k ) satisfying the condition ( (m, k) = 1 ) and ( k > 1 ) is infinite, so ( k ) cannot be determined from ( m ). Thus, we conclude.

Step 3: Calculate Cumulative Probability When combining the results from the two measurements, the combined result would be somewhere between their error margins.

The discriminant of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. 2. **Applying the condition to our function**: Our function is y=ax^{2}+4x+1, so a = a, b = 4, and c = 1.

Compute (a_3): [ a_3 = a_2 + a_1 + 2 cdot 1 = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6 ] 5. Compute (a_4): [ a_4 = a_3 + a_1 + 3 cdot 1 = 6 + 1 + 3 = 10 ] 6. Compute (a_5): [ a_5 = a_4 + a_1 + 4 cdot 1 = 10 + 1 + 4 = 15 ] 7. Compute (a_6): [ a_6 = a_5 + a_1 + 5 cdot 1 = 15 + 1 + 5 = 21 ] 8. Compute (a_7): [ a_7 = a_6 + a_1 + 6 cdot 1 = 21 + 1 + 6 = 28 ] 9. Compute (a_8): [ a_8 = a_7 + a_1 + 7 cdot 1 = 28 + 1 + 7 = 36 ] 10. Compute (a_9): [ a_9 = a_8 + a_1 + 8 cdot 1 = 36 + 1 + 8 = 45 ] 11. Compute (a_{10}): [ a_{10} = a_9 + a_1 + 9 cdot 1 = 45 + 1 + 9 = 55 ] 12. Compute (a_{11}): [ a_{11} = a_{10} + a_1 + 10 cdot 1 = 55 + 1 + 10 = 66 ] 13. Compute (a_{12}): [ a_{12} = a_{11} + a_1 + 11 cdot 1 = 66 + 1 + 11 = 78 ] 14. We observe that the sequence (a_k) follows the pattern of triangular numbers, which can be expressed as: [ a_k = frac{k(k+1)}{2} ] 15. Verify the formula for (k = 12): [ a_{12} = frac{12 cdot 13}{2} = 78 ] The final answer is (boxed{78})."},{"prompt":"A line passes through the origin with an inclination angle of 60^{circ} and intersects the circle x^{2}+y^{2}4y=0. Determine the radius of the circle and the length of the chord cut by the line on the circle.","completion":"Given that the line passes through the origin with an inclination angle of 60^{circ}, its equation can be written as y=sqrt{3}x. Rewriting the circle's equation in standard form (x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2, we get x^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=4. The center of the circle is (0,2), and its radius is r=2. To find the length of the chord, first find the distance d from the center of the circle to the line using the formula d=frac{|Ax_1+By_1+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}, where (x_1,y_1) is the center of the circle and A and B are coefficients from the line's equation in the general form Ax+By+C=0. In this case, d=frac{|2+0|}{sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2+1^2}}=1. Now, we can use the right triangle formed by the radius, the distance from the center to the line, and half of the chord length to find the length of the chord. According to the Pythagorean theorem, (r)^2=(d)^2+(frac{l}{2})^2. Solving for l, we get l=2sqrt{(r)^2-(d)^2}=2sqrt{4-1}=2sqrt{3}.

Let the four given consecutive natural numbers greater than 100 be ( n, n+1, n+2, ) and ( n+3 ). 2. We need to prove that we can choose three numbers from these four such that their sum can be represented as the product of three distinct natural numbers greater than 1. 3. Consider the sum of the three smallest numbers: ( n, n+1, ) and ( n+2 ). [ S_1 = n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 3(n+1) ] 4. Similarly, consider the sum of the three largest numbers: ( n+1, n+2, ) and ( n+3 ). [ S_2 = (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) = 3n + 6 = 3(n+2) ] 5. Notice that ( S_1 = 3(n+1) ) and ( S_2 = 3(n+2) ). We need to show that at least one of these sums can be represented as the product of three distinct natural numbers greater than 1. 6. Now, since ( n+1 ) and ( n+2 ) are two consecutive numbers, one of them must be even (since the consecutive integers always include an even number). Hence, consider the parity: - If ( n+1 ) is even, then ( n+1 = 2k ), where ( k ) is a natural number greater than 1 because ( n > 100 ). - Therefore, ( S_1 = 3(n+1) = 3 cdot 2k = 2 cdot 3 cdot k ). - These numbers are distinct and greater than 1 if ( k > 1 ) (since ( k > 50 ) when ( n > 100 )). 7. If ( n+2 ) is even, similarly: - Let ( n+2 = 2m ), with ( m ) being a natural number greater than 1. - Thus, ( S_2 = 3(n+2) = 3 cdot 2m = 2 cdot 3 cdot m ). - These numbers are distinct and greater than 1 if ( m > 1 ) (since ( m > 50 ) when ( n > 100 )). 8.

This sequence ensures ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots ), so: [ H = left{ a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots right} ] is an infinite set. 3. Consider an arbitrary finite subset ( K = left{a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, ldots, a_{i_m}right} ) with ( a_{i_m} ) being the largest element. Assume ( |K| geq 2 ) since individual elements of ( H ) are not perfect squares by construction. 4. The largest element ( a_{i_m} ) satisfies: [ left(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{i_m-1}right)^2 < a_{i_m} ] 5. Therefore: [ a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + ldots + a_{i_m} < left( a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{i_m-1} + 1 right)^2 ] 6. This inequality shows the sum of the elements of ( K ) lies between two consecutive perfect squares, thus it itself cannot be a perfect square. In conclusion, the set ( H ), constructed with the recursive sequence, also satisfies the required condition. Remarks: 1. The first solution demonstrated that choosing any non-square number instead of 2, such as ( H = {10, 10^3, 10^5, ldots} ), also works, since the hexadecimal representation ends with an odd number of zeros. 2. The problem can be generalized to any powers, not just squares. By following the concept in the solutions provided, one can construct an infinite set whose subset sums are never perfect k-th powers. 3. As demonstrated by Endre Németh, a generalization to multiple integers k_1, k_2, ldots, k_m shows the concept extends to these orders of powers as well. 4. Another approach, by Péter Benczúr, extends the solution to strictly increasing sequences with an unbounded difference sequence, ensuring no subset sum is a perfect power of an arbitrary sequence. 5. When constructing a set where no subset sum is a perfect power, care must be taken to ensure the set is infinite, not just arbitrarily large finite sets. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word COMMITTEE.","completion":"- First step is to pretend all the letters are unique, giving us 8! arrangements since there are 8 letters in \\"COMMITTEE.\\" - Next, we must account for the repeated letters.

If we place the number 1 in every cell of the leftmost column, the sum of any path from the left to the right edge will be at most (k). Since (n > k), it is impossible for the sum to be a multiple of (n).

For each (r), let (S_r) be the sum of the numbers on the path through the (r times k) rectangle. 5. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle:** Since there are (k) different sums (S_1, S_2, ldots, S_k) and only (n) possible residues modulo (n) (0, 1, 2, ..., (n-1)), by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two of these sums must have the same residue modulo (n).

These outcomes are: 1. {2,4,6}, 2. {2,4,8}, 3. {2,4,10}, 4. {2,6,8}, 5. {2,6,10}, 6. {2,8,10}, 7. {4,6,8}, 8. {4,6,10}, 9. {4,8,10}, 10. {6,8,10}. To check which of these sets can form a triangle, we apply the triangle inequality theorem to each set: - For sets 1 to 6, at least one combination violates the triangle inequality theorem. - Sets 7 ({4,6,8}), 9 ({4,8,10}), and 10 ({6,8,10}) satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, meaning they can form a triangle. Thus, out of the 10 possible outcomes, there are 3 outcomes where the segments can form a triangle.

Let us consider the cases: - **Case 1**: All numbers rolled are perfect squares themselves. These numbers are 1 and 4. - **Case 2**: The count of each prime factor in the product needs to be even. We will create a simpler probability distribution by determining the possible outcomes based on the constraints for the product to be a perfect square. 1. **Simplifying the Problem**: Numbers 1, 4, and 8 contribute to a perfect square condition easily.

The shortest non-adjacent travel path includes: - Moving from one girl to the third girl away (skipping over two adjacent girls). This would mean traversing an arc through 3 intervals of 45 degrees (135 degrees). This can be broken into two isosceles triangles along the radius at any middle point between non-adjacent girls. - Using one radius as the base, the angle subtended at the center by paths covering three arcs is 135 degrees, leaving the other angles in the triangle to be (180-135)/2 = 22.5 degrees. Therefore, applying the law of cosines \`c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab*cos(γ)\`: path length is \`c = sqrt(50^2 + 50^2 - 2*50*50*cos(135)) = 50*sqrt(2 + sqrt(2))\`. 4.

The distances from the center C to points A and B must be equal, as they both lie on the circle. This gives us the equation CA^{2}=CB^{2}.

Since the proportion of sodium chloride in the tank is 30% by volume, the volume of sodium chloride in the mixture is 0.3V gallons. The volume of water in the mixture initially is therefore V - 0.3V = 0.7V gallons. The water evaporates at a rate of 0.4 gallons per hour, so in 6 hours, the volume of water that evaporates is 0.4 gallons/hour * 6 hours = 2.4 gallons. The remaining volume of water in the mixture after 6 hours is 0.7V - 2.4 gallons. We are given that after 6 hours, the concentration of water in the mixture is 50%. This means that the volume of water is equal to the volume of sodium chloride, which has not changed and remains at 0.3V gallons. So, we have the equation: 0.7V - 2.4 = 0.3V Solving for V: 0.7V - 0.3V = 2.4 0.4V = 2.4 V = 2.4 / 0.4 V = 6 gallons The initial volume of the mixture in the tank is 6 gallons.

Our goal is to reduce the radius of such a circle until it is no longer possible while still containing all points. Let ( R ) be the radius of the smallest such circle that contains all the given points. 1. **Case: Exactly 2 points on the boundary** Suppose there are exactly two points, ( A ) and ( B ), on the boundary of the circle. These points must be diametrically opposite since reducing the circle's radius would otherwise make it impossible to contain both points. Next, consider any third point, ( C ). Since every three points can fit into a circle of radius 1, the minimal circle containing ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) also has radius ( R ). Thus, ( R leq 1 ). 2. **Case: Exactly 3 points on the boundary** Next, consider the scenario where there are exactly three points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) on the boundary of the circle. The triangle ( ABC ) must be an acute triangle because if it were not, we could reduce the radius of the circle containing all points, contradicting our assumption of minimal radius.

We need to prove that (angle AOB > angle AO_1B). 3. **Angle Comparison**: Observe that by similarity of triangles and the properties of parallel lines: [ angle C_1BA > angle CAB quad text{and} quad angle D_1BA > angle DBA ] Therefore, [ angle AO_1B = 180^circ - angle C_1AB - angle D_1BA < 180^circ - angle CAB - angle DBA = angle AOB ] 4. **Contradiction and Conclusion**: Since ( angle AOB ) cannot be greater than ( angle AO_1B ) without ( C_1 ) and ( D_1 ) being actually ( C ) and ( D ), respectively, we arrive at a contradiction.

D: In the same plane, there is one and only one line passing through a point that is perpendicular to a given line.","completion":"To evaluate the correctness of each statement, let's analyze them one by one: - **Statement A**: The distance between two points is indeed the length of the shortest path connecting them, which is the line segment. However, the statement says it is the line segment itself, which is a misinterpretation. The correct interpretation should be that the distance refers to the length of this segment, not the segment. Therefore, Statement A is incorrect. - **Statement B**: If two lines are perpendicular to the same line, it means they both form a right angle with that line. However, this does not imply that they are perpendicular to each other; instead, they are parallel to each other. Therefore, Statement B is incorrect because it misunderstands the relationship between the lines. - **Statement C**: According to the parallel postulate, through a point not on a given line, there is exactly one line parallel to the given line in a plane. The statement misses the condition of the point being outside the given line. Therefore, while the essence is correct, the omission of \\"outside the line\\" makes Statement C incorrect. - **Statement D**: This statement is based on the fundamental property of perpendicular lines. In a plane, for any given line and a point not on that line, there is exactly one line through the point that is perpendicular to the given line. This is a well-established geometric principle, making Statement D correct.

A 4-digit palindrome license plate number (aabb) is observed. This number must be divisible by each child's age and the last two digits (22) indicate Mrs. Smith's age. 2. **Divisibility Analysis**: - Since the oldest child is 10, the number might need to be divisible by 10. However, since the last two digits are 22, it is not divisible by 10. We need to consider other ages. - The sum of the digits (2a + 2b) must be a multiple of any common divisibility requirements (e.g., 3 or 9). 3. **Choosing a Suitable Number**: - aabb = 1122 ensures that 22 is the age of Mrs. Smith. - Check divisibility by 4, 6, 7, 8, 9: - Divisible by 4: Last two digits are 22, which is not divisible by 4. - Divisible by 5: The number 1122 is not divisible by 5. - Divisible by 7: 1122 div 7 approx 160.29 (not divisible). - Divisible by 9: The sum of digits, 6, is not divisible by 9. 4. **Conclusion**: The number 1122 is not divisible by several of the listed ages. Among these, age 5 is definitely not a divisor as 1122 is not divisible by 5. Therefore, the age of one of Mrs. Smith's children that is not a divisor of the license plate number 1122 is 5.

The derivative is given by f'(x) = -frac{1}{2x} + frac{1}{2}x = frac{x^2 - 1}{2x}. Thus, the function f(x) is decreasing on left[frac{1}{e}, 1right) and increasing on (1, e]. The function reaches its minimum value at x=1, so f(1) = frac{5}{4}. Calculating fleft(frac{1}{e}right) = frac{3}{2} + frac{1}{4e^2} and f(e) = frac{1}{2} + frac{e^2}{4}, we find that f(e) > fleft(frac{1}{e}right). Consequently, the function reaches its maximum value at x=e, so f(e) = frac{1}{2} + frac{e^2}{4}. Therefore, the maximum and minimum values of f(x) on the interval left[frac{1}{e}, eright] are boxed{frac{1}{2} + frac{e^2}{4}} and boxed{frac{5}{4}}, respectively. (2) The derivative for any a is f'(x) = frac{a}{x} + (a+1)x = frac{(a+1)x^2 + a}{x} quad (x > 0). When a = -1, f'(x) = -frac{1}{x} < 0, so the function f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty). For a neq -1, consider the discriminant Delta = -4a(a+1). From Delta leq 0, we get a geq 0 or a < -1. Therefore: - When a geq 0, f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). - When a < -1, f'(x) < 0 and f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty). From Delta > 0, we find -1 < a < 0 and frac{-a}{a+1} > 0. Thus, we have f'(x) = frac{(a+1)left(x + sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}right)left(x - sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}right)}{x}, which implies f(x) is decreasing on left(0, sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}right) and increasing on left[sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}, +inftyright). To summarize: when a leq -1, f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty); when a geq 0, f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty); and when -1 < a < 0, f(x) is decreasing on left(0, sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}right) and increasing on left[sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}, +inftyright). (3) When -1 < a < 0, the function f(x) reaches its minimum at x = sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}, so fleft(sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}right) = frac{a}{2}lnleft(frac{-a}{a+1}right) - frac{a}{2} + 1. Because f(x) > 1 + frac{a}{2}ln(-a) for any x > 0, we have frac{a}{2}lnleft(frac{-a}{a+1}right) - frac{a}{2} + 1 > 1 + frac{a}{2}ln(-a). Simplifying, we get ln(a+1) > -1. Combining this with -1 < a < 0, we obtain frac{1}{e} - 1 < a < 0.

At some moment, it will first touch the lateral surface of the pyramid. Assume it touches the face ( S A_{1} A_{2} ) at point ( Q ) (see Figure 4 for visualization). 3. **Equality of tangents**: Since tangents from a common external point to a sphere are equal, we have: [ P A_{1} = Q A_{1} quad text{and} quad P A_{2} = Q A_{2} ] Thus, the triangles ( P A_{1} A_{2} ) and ( Q A_{1} A_{2} ) are congruent. 4. **Considering rotation of the plane ( S A_{1} A_{2} )**: When rotating the plane ( S A_{1} A_{2} ) about the segment ( A_{1} A_{2} ) to align it with the plane ( X_{1} A_{1} A_{2} ), the point ( Q ) maps to ( P ).

According to the question, a_1 + 3a_8 + a_{15} = 120, we substitute a_8 and a_{15} with the terms above: a_1 + 3(a_1 + 7d) + (a_1 + 14d) = 120, 5a_1 + 35d = 120. Now, let's simplify and find the value of a_8: 3(a_1 + 7d) = 3a_8, 3a_8 = 120 - (a_1 + 14d), 3a_8 = 120 - 5a_1 - 35d, 3a_8 = 120 - (5a_1 + 35d), 3a_8 = 120, a_8 = 40.

However, something seems wrong in the initial computation and the final answer deviates from the original choices given. This discrepancy indicates a need for re-evaluation. Let's backtrack and reassess our steps: We established that: 3a_8 = 120 - (a_1 + 14d), but we cannot conclude directly that 3a_8 = 120.

Now we can proceed correctly: Since a_1 + 7d = 24, we can say a_1 = 24 - 7d. We can express 3a_9 - a_{11} like this: 3a_9 - a_{11} = 3(a_1 + 8d) - (a_1 + 10d), 3a_9 - a_{11} = 3(24 - 7d + 8d) - (24 - 7d + 10d), 3a_9 - a_{11} = 3 cdot 24 + 3d - 24 +3d, 3a_9 - a_{11} = 72 + 3d - 24 + 3d, 3a_9 - a_{11} = 48 + 6d.

This means that 40% of the passengers with round-trip tickets did take their cars aboard the ship (since 100% - 60% = 40%). We know that the 40% of passengers with round-trip tickets who took their cars aboard the ship is equal to the 25% of the total passengers who took their cars aboard the ship (from the first point). Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 0.40 * (Round-trip ticket holders) = 0.25P Let's denote the number of round-trip ticket holders as R. Then we have: 0.40R = 0.25P To find the percentage of the ship's passengers who held round-trip tickets (which is R/P), we need to solve for R/P: R/P = (0.25P) / (0.40) R/P = 0.25 / 0.40 R/P = 5/8 R/P = 0.625 To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0.625 * 100 = 62.5% Therefore, boxed{62.5%} of the ship's passengers held round-trip tickets."},{"prompt":"Bob and Jim decide to skip rocks.

Given that the average of these seven numbers is 80, we can write the following equation: [frac{a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7}{7} = 80] Multiplying both sides by 7, we get: [a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 560] We are also given that the difference between the largest and the smallest is 20, so: [a_7 - a_1 = 20] To maximize (a_7), we need to minimize (a_1) and the other numbers (a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6). Since these are positive integers, the smallest value for (a_1) is 1. If (a_1 = 1), then (a_7 = a_1 + 20 = 21). However, we need to check if the other numbers can be minimized such that their sum with (a_1) and (a_7) still equals 560. The smallest values for (a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6) would be 1 as well, but to ensure that the sum is 560, we need to distribute the remaining sum (560 - (a_1) - (a_7)) among (a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6). So, we have: [560 - 1 - 21 = 538] We need to distribute 538 among 5 numbers, which means each number can be at least (538 / 5). However, since we are dealing with integers, we cannot have a fraction. The largest integer less than (538 / 5) is 107, so we can set (a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = a_5 = a_6 = 107). Now let's check if the sum equals 560: [1 + 107 + 107 + 107 + 107 + 107 + 21 = 1 + 535 + 21 = 557] We are 3 short of 560, so we need to add 1 to three of the numbers (a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6) to make the sum equal to 560.

We can visualize these 27 units as points on a plane. 2. **Process Description**: - Each minute, Karlson erases two arbitrary numbers (x) and (y) and writes down their sum (x + y). - Simultaneously, he consumes an amount of candy equal to the product of the two numbers erased, which is (x times y). 3. **Connecting Group Points**: - Consider each number on the board as a point. - When two numbers (x) and (y) are erased and replaced by their sum (x + y), we are effectively merging two groups (points), and this merge is represented by a line segment between the corresponding two points. 4. **Candy Consumption Calculation**: - In each merging process, Karlson eats (x times y) candies. - The objective is to maximize the total amount of candy eaten, which sums the products of the numbers merged in each step. 5. **Final Sum Representation**: - After 27 minutes, since each minute results in reducing the number of points by one, all 27 points will have been merged into a single point after 27 minutes. 6. **Combination Calculation**: - The maximum number of distinct two-point connections (line segments) that can be formed among (n) points is given by the combination formula: [ binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] - For (n = 27), the maximum number of connections is: [ binom{27}{2} = frac{27 times 26}{2} = 351 ] 7. **Conclusion**: - Thus, the maximum number of candies that Karlson could eat in 27 minutes is 351.

If ( B ) has not defeated anyone in the sequence, place ( B ) at the end. - This ensures that ( B )’s position is correct with respect to their predecessor and successor: - If ( B ) is placed before someone ( B ) has defeated, then the arrangement satisfies the condition for ( B ) and their successor. - If ( B ) is placed at the end, this implies ( B ) was defeated by everyone in the sequence before ( B ), satisfying the condition for each player. Thus, the induction step is verified, proving the statement for ( n+1 ). Therefore, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all ( n ). [ boxed{} ] II. Proof by Constructive Algorithm 1. **Initial Arrangement:** - Arrange the participants in any random order. 2. **Swapping Pairs:** - Compare each pair of consecutive participants starting with the first pair. If the first participant of the pair lost to the second, swap them. - Continue this process with all pairs up to the last pair. 3. **Iteration:** - After comparing and swapping up to the last pair, return to the beginning of the list and repeat the process. - Ensure every iteration checks the current order and executes necessary swaps to correct the order. 4. **Completion:** - Given a finite number of participants and a finite number of possible arrangements, repeating the comparison and swapping will eventually result in no swaps being necessary, meaning the desired arrangement has been found. - Since no participant can be swapped back to a position where they precede someone they have lost to, each transition progressively moves the arrangement towards the correct order. By executing this iterative process, the player's arrangement will conform to the problem requirements.

Due to ( PQ ) being a common chord, ( PQ ) is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of these two circles. 3. **Perpendicular Relationship:** Let ( Z ) be the center of the circle ( AIC ). Since ( PQ ) is perpendicular to the line segment ( IZ ), we have: [ PQ perp IZ ] which implies: [ IZ perp AC ] 4. **Properties of the Center ( Z ):** Given that ( Z ) is the center of the circle ( AIC ), it lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( AC ). Thus, we know: [ ZA = ZC ] 5. **Incenter ( I ) and Perpendicular Bisector:** Since ( IZ ) is perpendicular to ( AC ) and ( Z ) is equidistant from ( A ) and ( C ), it means that ( I ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( AC ), because ( I ) is the incenter and coincides with the perpendicular bisector of ( AC ). 6. **Equality of Sides:** Therefore, [ angle IZA = angle IZC ] Since ( ZA = ZC ) and angles are equal, triangle ( ZAC ) must be an isosceles triangle with [ ZA = ZC ] 7. **Conclusion:** Given the properties and deductions above, we conclude that triangle ( ABC ) is isosceles with ( AB = BC ).

If the inequality frac{(xm)(x1)}{x} > f(x) holds for any positive real number x, find the set of positive integers for m.","completion":"1. To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y = f(x) at x = 1, we first calculate the derivative of f(x): [ f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x - ln x - 2) = 1 - frac{1}{x}. ] Then, we find the slope of the tangent line at x = 1: [ f'(1) = 1 - frac{1}{1} = 0. ] The value of f(1) is: [ f(1) = 1 - ln 1 - 2 = -1. ] Therefore, the point of tangency is (1, -1), and since the slope is 0, the equation of the tangent line is y = -1. So, the equation of the tangent line is boxed{y = -1}. 2. To find the value of k for which f(x) has a root in the interval (k, k+1), we analyze the behavior of f(x): - For 0 < x < 1, since f'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} < 0, f(x) is decreasing. - For x > 1, since f'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} > 0, f(x) is increasing. The minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = 1, where f(1) = -1 < 0. Also, evaluating f(x) at x = frac{1}{e^2} gives: [ fleft(frac{1}{e^2}right) = frac{1}{e^2} - ln frac{1}{e^2} - 2 = frac{1}{e^2} + 2 - 2 > 0. ] Therefore, f(x) has a root in the interval (0, 1), so k = 0. Similarly, evaluating f(x) at x = 3 and x = 4 gives: [ f(3) = 3 - ln 3 - 2 < 0, quad f(4) = 4 - ln 4 - 2 > 0. ] Thus, f(x) has a root in the interval (3, 4), so k = 3.

To find the set of positive integers for m, we analyze the inequality frac{(x-m)(x-1)}{x} > f(x) for different ranges of x: - For x = 1, the inequality always holds. - For 0 < x < 1, we have m > frac{xln x + x}{x-1}. - For x > 1, we have m < frac{xln x + x}{x-1}. From the analysis in part 2, we know that f(x) has roots at x_1 in (0, 1) and x_2 in (3, 4). Therefore, we conclude that x_1 < m < x_2.

Since the square root function is defined only for non-negative inputs, we must ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative, i.e., (3-a)(a+6) geq 0. 2. Solving the inequality, we have two critical points: a = -6 and a = 3. By testing the intervals around these points, we find that the expression is non-negative for -6 leqslant a leqslant 3, which is consistent with the given domain. 3. Now, let's find the maximum value of the function within the domain. To do this, we can analyze the critical points and the endpoints of the interval. The critical points occur when the derivative of the function is zero or undefined. 4. Taking the derivative of f(a), we get: f'(a) = frac{1}{2sqrt{(3-a)(a+6)}} [(3-a)(1) + (a+6)(-1)] = frac{-a - 3}{2sqrt{(3-a)(a+6)}} 5. Setting f'(a) = 0 and solving for a, we get a = -3. However, this point is not a local extremum because it's a point of inflection; the function doesn't change its direction at a = -3. 6. Since there are no local extrema within the interval, we need to check the endpoints. Plugging in a = -6 and a = 3, we get: f(-6) = sqrt{(3-(-6))(-6+6)} = sqrt{9 cdot 0} = 0 f(3) = sqrt{(3-3)(3+6)} = sqrt{0 cdot 9} = 0 7. However, these results don't seem correct because the function is always positive within the interval. To resolve this, let's consider the function g(a) = (3-a)(a+6) instead. The maximum value of f(a) will be the square root of the maximum value of g(a). 8. The derivative of g(a) is g'(a) = -a - 3. Setting g'(a) = 0, we get a = -3. This point is indeed a local maximum since g'(a) changes from positive to negative around a = -3. 9. Plugging a = -3 into g(a), we get g(-3) = (3-(-3))(-3+6) = 6 cdot 3 = 18. 10.

This means we can group them in any way we find convenient for the purpose of further steps in the solution. 2. **Initial Placement on Balance Scale**: Select the first pair of weights and place them on the two sides of a balance scale arbitrarily. Denote these weights by (a) and (a + alpha) where (0 leq alpha leq 20). That is, the weights we place initially are such that the difference between them is within the given range. 3. **Iterative Placement of Pairs**: For each subsequent pair of weights, we adopt a strategy of placing the heavier weight on the lighter side of the balance scale. Suppose we have a new pair of weights (b) and (b + beta) where (0 leq beta leq 20). We will place these weights such that the heavier weight from this pair is placed on the lighter side of the balance scale currently holding the previous weights (a) and (a + alpha). 4. **Calculating the Difference**: As we place each pair in this manner, we need to ensure that the difference between the total weights on either side of the balance scales remains within the allowable range. Initially, when the weights (a) and (a + alpha) are placed, the difference is (alpha). Consider the new placement of weights: - If (a) and (a + alpha) are already on the scales and we add the new weights (b) and (b + beta) such that (b + beta) is placed with (a) and (b) with (a + alpha), the difference between the total weights on the scales will be: [ left| (a + b + beta) - (a + alpha + b) right| = left| beta - alpha right| ] 5. **Ensuring the Difference Maximum**: Given that both (alpha) and (beta) are between 0 and 20, the maximum possible difference (|alpha - beta|) is 20. This is because for any two values within the range from 0 to 20, their absolute difference will not exceed 20. 6. **Conclusion**: By following this method, we ensure that the difference between the total weights on both sides of the balance scale stays within the acceptable limit of 20 at any stage of the process. Thus, we have shown that with this method, the difference in the weights on the balance scale will never exceed 20, satisfying the given condition.

Hence, there exists at least one vertex (C) that lies inside this strip. 6. In the triangle (ABC), the only angle that could be obtuse is the angle opposite the longest side by the elementary triangle properties. Therefore, since side lengths are all equal, we choose the sub-triangle where possible obtuse conditions can occur. 7. If we assume one vertex (C) lays below extending the sub-triangle, in the respective opposite condition, at least one neighbor vertex would contrarily dissatisfy, and one neighbor must lie below (C) for consistency. 8.

Since f(x) > 1, we have f[f(x)] = log_{2}(f(x)) = log_{2}(log_{2}x). Therefore, y = f[f(x)] - 1 = log_{2}(log_{2}x) - 1. To find the zeros, we set y = 0, so log_{2}(log_{2}x) - 1 = 0, which yields log_{2}(log_{2}x) = 1. This gives us log_{2}x = 2, and finally, x = 4. In summary, the zeros of the function y=f[f(x)]-1 are x = -1, 1, 4.
