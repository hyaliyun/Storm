When m=1, we have f(x)=frac{1}{x}+xln x. Differentiating f(x) gives f'(x)=frac{1}{x^{2}}+ln x+1. Since f'(x) is monotonically increasing in (0, +infty) and f'(1)=0, for x > 1, we have f'(x) > 0; for 0 < x < 1, f'(x) < 0. Thus, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval (1, +infty). 2. We compute h(x)=frac{m}{x}+2x-sqrt{2}, and its derivative h'(x)=frac{2x^2-m}{x^2}. Setting h'(x)=0 yields x=sqrt{frac{m}{2}}. When 0 < x < sqrt{frac{m}{2}}, we have h'(x) < 0, so h(x) is decreasing on (0, sqrt{frac{m}{2}}). When x > sqrt{frac{m}{2}}, h'(x) > 0 and h(x) is increasing on (sqrt{frac{m}{2}}, +infty).

For case (ii) when 0 < sqrt{2}(2sqrt{m}-1) < sqrt{frac{m}{2}}, that is frac{1}{4} < m < frac{4}{9}, the function y=h(h(x)) has the minimum value h(sqrt{frac{m}{2}})=sqrt{2}(2sqrt{m}-1)=frac{3}{2}sqrt{2}.

Considering the function y=frac{ln x-2}{x}, its derivative y'=frac{3-ln x}{x^2} is always positive in [1, e].

Subtracting r yields 150 - r < 63k < 250 - r. Since 0 leq r leq 6, the bounds on k vary slightly depending on r. To find integer k values, consider the extreme cases for r: - If r = 0, then 150 < 63k < 250, leading to frac{150}{63} < k < frac{250}{63}, approximately 2.38 < k < 3.97.

First, we need to identify the prime factorization of ( m = 30030 ). We have: [ 30030 = 2 times 3 times 5 times 7 times 11 times 13 ] This means ( m ) has six distinct prime factors. 2. We need to find the set ( M ) of positive divisors of ( m ) that have exactly 2 prime factors. These divisors are the products of any two distinct primes from the prime factorization of ( m ).

The existing sums won’t change, but we introduce new sums corresponding to (2k) and (2k + 1). - The new sums {-(2k+2), -(2k+1), 2k, 2k+1}, combined with the old sums, yield (2k + 4 = 2(k + 1)), satisfying the unique sums requirement. 5. **Conclusion for Even n:** - By mathematical induction, if (n = 2(k+1)), then the hypothesis holds true. Hence, the configuration is feasible for any even (n). 6. **Case 2: (n) is odd ((n = 2k + 1)):** - Assume for contradiction that we can fill the grid for some odd (n = 2k + 1). - Let the sums of rows be (r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n) and sums of columns (s_1, s_2, ldots, s_n). - These sums must cover the integers from -n to n without repetition. - Thus the total absolute sum is: [ sum_{i=1}^{n}|r_i| + sum_{j=1}^{n}|s_j| geq sum_{k=-n}^{n}|k| - n = n^2. ] 7. **Contradiction:** - The (2n) different sums split between negative and non-negative: [ sum_{i=1}^n |r_i| + sum_{j=1}^n |s_j| = 2 sum_{text{positive}} - 2 sum_{text{negative}}. ] - Evaluate the filled entries (a_{ij}) in the grid for sums sum_{i,j} a_{ij}. - This sum is bounded above: [ sum_{i,j} a_{ij} leq 4k(n - k), ] implying: [ n^2 leq 4k(n - k). ] - Simplifying leads to: [ (n - 2k)^2 leq 0, ] - Since (n = 2k+1), (n - 2k)^2 = 1^2 = 1 > 0, a contradiction indicating that it is impossible for odd (n). # Conclusion: For n even, the desired grid exists and can be constructed.

We have g'(x) = e^x - 1. 3. **Monotonicity Analysis**: - For x < 0, since e^x < 1, we have g'(x) < 0. This means g(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (-infty, 0). - For x > 0, since e^x > 1, we have g'(x) > 0. This implies g(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval (0, +infty). 4. **Minimum Value of g(x)**: Since g(x) is decreasing before 0 and increasing after 0, it reaches its minimum at x=0.

This step-by-step analysis confirms that the function f(n) eventually equals 1 after a certain number of applications only for the specified powers of 2 within the given range."},{"prompt":"Determine the degree measure of the smallest positive angle phi such that [cos 10^circ = sin 30^circ + sin phi.]","completion":"Given the equation: [ cos 10^circ = sin 30^circ + sin phi ] we start by substituting for (sin 30^circ): [ cos 10^circ = frac{1}{2} + sin phi ] Rearranging for (sin phi), we get: [ sin phi = cos 10^circ - frac{1}{2} ] Using the cosine difference formula (cos 10^circ = sin 80^circ), the equation becomes: [ sin phi = sin 80^circ - frac{1}{2} ] We can simplify this using trigonometric identities, but we realize this doesn't resolve into another simple identity directly.

The area of quadrilateral (ABCD) is (frac{(a+b)h}{2}). We need to determine the measure of (angle B). First, consider the two triangles within the quadrilateral: 1. (triangle ABD) 2. (triangle BCD) These triangles collectively form the quadrilateral (ABCD). Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Calculate the Area of (triangle ABD)**: The area of triangle (triangle ABD) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a right triangle: [ text{Area of } triangle ABD = frac{1}{2} times AD times AB = frac{1}{2} times a times h = frac{ah}{2} ] 2. **Calculate the Area of (triangle BCD)**: The total area of quadrilateral (ABCD) is given by: [ text{Area of } ABCD = frac{(a+b)h}{2} ] The area of (triangle BCD) can be found by subtracting the area of (triangle ABD) from the total area: [ text{Area of } triangle BCD = frac{(a+b)h}{2} - frac{ah}{2} = frac{(a+b)h - ah}{2} = frac{bh}{2} ] 3. **Determine the Height of (triangle BCD)**: Since (BC = b) is the base of (triangle BCD) and the area of (triangle BCD) is already known, we can write the area formula: [ text{Area of } triangle BCD = frac{1}{2} times BC times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times b times h ] Therefore, the height from point (D) perpendicular to (BC) must be (h). 4. **Draw the Perpendicular (DX)**: Let (DX) be the perpendicular drawn from (D) to (BC). Therefore, (DX) must be: [ DX = h ] 5. **Use Circle Properties with Diameter (BD)**: Draw a circle with diameter (BD). According to the properties of a circle, any angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is a right angle (Thales' theorem). Therefore, angles subtended by (BA) and (DX) at point (B) are both right angles. 6. **Show the Right Angles**: [ angle DBX = angle BDA = 90^circ - angle DBA ] Because (BA) is perpendicular to (DX): [ angle ABX = 90^circ ] 7. **Conclusion**: From the above calculations, it shows (angle ABX) must be a right angle as well.

To proceed, we consider the number n which can be expressed in terms of its decimal digits. Suppose n is given in its expanded form as: [ n = a_k 10^{3k} + a_{k-1} 10^{3(k-1)} + cdots + a_1 10^3 + a_0, ] where a_i are the groups of digits obtained by splitting n into groups of three.

Thus, each power of 10^3 is congruent to 1 modulo 999, meaning: [ 10^{3i} equiv 1^i equiv 1 pmod{999}. ] Therefore, substituting these congruences back into our expression for n gives: [ n equiv a_k cdot 1 + a_{k-1} cdot 1 + cdots + a_1 cdot 1 + a_0 pmod{999}, ] which simplifies to: [ n equiv a_k + a_{k-1} + cdots + a_1 + a_0 pmod{999}. ] This sum of the groups, S: [ S = a_k + a_{k-1} + cdots + a_1 + a_0, ] is therefore congruent to n modulo 999: [ S equiv n pmod{999}. ] Since 999 is divisible by 37, if S is divisible by 37, then n must also be divisible by 37, and vice versa.

The length of BC is given as BC = 2sqrt{2}. 2. **Calculate Side Lengths in Triangle ABC:** Since angle ACB = 30^circ, using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we get: - The length of AC (opposite the 30° angle) is AC = BC cdot sin 30^circ = 2sqrt{2} cdot frac{1}{2} = sqrt{2}. - The length of AB (opposite the 60° angle) is AB = BC cdot cos 30^circ = 2sqrt{2} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = sqrt{6}. 3. **Analyze the Symmetry and Heights in the Pyramid:** The pyramid DABC has equal side lengths AD = BD = CD. Thus, the altitude of the pyramid from D to the base ABC passes through the midpoint H of BC. 4. **Determine the Coordinates of M and O:** Since the sphere of radius 1 is tangent to AD and BD and extends along the prolongation of CD beyond D, we know: - The center O lies in the plane formed by the symmetry of DB and DA. - Because H is the midpoint of BC, the plane alpha that contains OH and is parallel to HK should be considered. 5. **Intersection of Symmetrical Planes:** To ensure that O is correctly positioned, recall that the sphere touches the prolongation DC_1 and the plane BAC. The intersection line a of the planes alpha and beta through D must be parallel to HK. 6. **Locating Point O:** As D, H, and C_1 are aligned, draw a perpendicular line from H parallel to AC.

Confirm that O is exactly 1 unit away, along the line DC_1 such that DC_1 is perpendicular to O and M lies on AC. 7. **Calculate the Distance from A to Tangent Point:** Finally, since O lies at the intersection on the plane extended from AC: [ AC = BC cdot sin 60^circ = 2sqrt{2} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = sqrt{6} ] 8. **Final Calculation for Tangent Line from A:** The distance from A to the point of tangency can be solved from: [ text{distance} = sqrt{(AC^2 + 1^2)} - 1 = sqrt{(sqrt{6})^2 + 1} - 1 = sqrt{7} - 1 ] Thus, the length of the tangent segment from A to the sphere is determined to be: [ boxed{sqrt{3} - 1} ]"},{"prompt":"Show that if the distance between opposite edges of a tetrahedron is at least 1 , then its volume is at least frac{1}{3} . *Proposed by Simeon Kiflie*","completion":"To show that if the distance between opposite edges of a tetrahedron is at least 1, then its volume is at least (frac{1}{3}), we will use the lemma that every tetrahedron can be inscribed in a parallelepiped of three times the volume of the tetrahedron. 1. **Lemma Proof:** - Every tetrahedron is an affine transformation of every other tetrahedron, including a regular tetrahedron. - A regular tetrahedron can be inscribed in a cube. - The volume ratio of the inscribed tetrahedron to the cube is the same for all tetrahedra due to affine transformation properties. - For a unit cube, the volume of the inscribed regular tetrahedron is calculated as follows: [ text{Volume of tetrahedron} = int_0^1 2h(1-h) , dh = int_0^1 (2h - 2h^2) , dh = left[ h^2 - frac{2h^3}{3} right]_0^1 = 1 - frac{2}{3} = frac{1}{3} ] - Therefore, the volume of the tetrahedron is (frac{1}{3}) of the volume of the cube, and the volume of the parallelepiped is three times the volume of the tetrahedron. 2. **Main Proof:** - We need to show that the smallest parallelepiped with each pair of opposite faces at least one unit apart is the unit cube. - Consider a parallelepiped in (mathbb{R}^3) with faces defined by: [ z = 0, quad z = 1, quad z = ax, quad z = ax - sqrt{a^2 + 1}, quad z = bx + cy, quad z = bx + cy - sqrt{b^2 + c^2 + 1} ] - The volume of this parallelepiped is: [ 1 times frac{sqrt{a^2 + 1}}{|a|} times frac{sqrt{b^2 + c^2 + 1}}{sqrt{b^2 + c^2}} geq 1 times 1 times 1 = 1 ] - If some angles are right, it implies ( |a| to infty ) or ( (|b|, |c|) to (infty, infty) ) or both. - Equality occurs only when both limits are taken, resulting in a unit cube. Since the volume of the smallest parallelepiped with each pair of opposite faces at least one unit apart is 1, and the volume of the tetrahedron inscribed in this parallelepiped is (frac{1}{3}), we conclude that the volume of the tetrahedron is at least (frac{1}{3}).

The slope of the line, which is (7-a), must be positive. This ensures the line is increasing and not descending into the fourth quadrant. 2. The y-intercept, which is a, must be non-negative.

The tiling with cubes, often referred to as a cubic lattice, is straightforward since cubes naturally tessellate in three dimensions without leaving any gaps. 2. **Transforming Cubes into Rhombic Dodecahedra:** To proceed further, consider subdividing parts of this cubic lattice. Specifically, select one cube in the center and leave it intact. Surround this central cube with adjacent cubes in the lattice. 3. **Subdividing Surrounding Cubes:** For the surrounding cubes, imagine slicing these \\"framing\\" cubes with planes that pass through all six pairs of opposite edges. This slicing results in each surrounding cube being divided into six congruent pyramids. Each pyramid has a square base (since the original cube's faces are squares) and lateral edges that are equal to half the cross-diagonal of the cube. 4. **Formation of Rhombic Dodecahedron:** The pyramids that adjoin the central cube combine with the central cube itself to form a geometric shape known as a rhombic dodecahedron. Specifically, the edges of the central cube serve as the principal diagonals of the faces of the rhombic dodecahedron. Each face of the rhombic dodecahedron is a rhombus, with the diagonals meeting at equal lengths, confirming the structure as a rhombic dodecahedron. 5. **Filling Space with Rhombic Dodecahedra:** By repeating the above process for each cube in the original cubic lattice, it becomes clear that the entire space can be tessellated or filled using rhombic dodecahedra. Hence, it is demonstrated that space can indeed be filled with rhombic dodecahedral cells. 6. **Volume Relation:** As a consequence of this transformation, it is also evident that the volume of each rhombic dodecahedron is equal to double the volume of a cube, where the cube's edge corresponds to the shorter diagonal of the face of the rhombic dodecahedron. This relation helps in understanding the volume properties of these geometric shapes. # Conclusion: Thus, it has been shown through geometric construction and analysis that space can be completely filled using cells in the form of rhombic dodecahedra. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"The minimum value of the distance from a point on the curve y=e^{x}+1 to the line xy2=0 is: A: 3 B: sqrt{2} C: 2 D: 2sqrt{2}","completion":"To find the minimum distance from a point on the curve y=e^{x}+1 to the line x-y-2=0, we follow these steps: 1. **Identify a Point on the Curve**: Let's consider a point P(x_{0}, e^{x_{0}}+1) on the curve y=e^{x}+1. 2. **Find the Condition for Minimum Distance**: The distance from point P to the line x-y-2=0 is minimized when the tangent line at P is parallel to the line y=x-2.

Let's consider the case when ( x = 1 ) for simplicity, as the percentage error will be the same for any value of ( x ) due to the operations being proportional. For ( x = 1 ): Correct result: ( 81 times 1^2 = 81 ) Incorrect result: ( frac{sqrt{1}}{3} = frac{1}{3} ) Now we can calculate the percentage error: [ text{Percentage Error} = left| frac{81 - frac{1}{3}}{81} right| times 100% ] [ text{Percentage Error} = left| frac{81 - frac{1}{3}}{81} right| times 100% = left| frac{243 - 1}{243} right| times 100% ] [ text{Percentage Error} = left| frac{242}{243} right| times 100% approx 99.59% ] So the percentage of error obtained in the final result is approximately boxed{99.59%} ."},{"prompt":"By a tropical polynomial we mean a function of the form p(x) = a_n odot x^n oplus a_{n1} odot x^{n1} oplus cdots oplus a_1 odot x oplus a_0, where exponentiation is as defined in the previous problem.

To ensure that the rest have shaken hands with at least one person in the set, we need to select people who are not adjacent to each other. If we select person a1, then a2 and a36 have already shaken hands with someone in the set. We can skip a2 and a3 because they have already shaken hands with a1. The next person we can select is a4, which covers a3 and a5. Continuing this pattern, we can select every third person in the circle to ensure that all people have shaken hands with someone in the set. However, since there are 36 people, we can optimize this by selecting two people who are adjacent to each other, such as a1 and a2. This way, a1 covers a36 and a2, and a2 covers a1 and a3. Then, a3 will cover a2 and a4, and so on, until a36, which covers a35 and a1. By selecting a1 and a2, we ensure that every person in the circle has shaken hands with at least one person in the set.

This implies: - When x < 1, f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is strictly decreasing. - When x > 1, f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is strictly increasing. In this scenario, f(x) can have at most two zeros, which contradicts the requirement of having 3 distinct zeros. - **Case ②:** For 0 < a < frac{e}{2}, solving f'(x) = 0 gives x = 1 or x = ln(2a) < 1. The function's behavior can be summarized as follows: - For x in (-infty, ln(2a)), f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is increasing. - At x = ln(2a), f(x) reaches a maximum. - For x in (ln(2a), 1), f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is decreasing. - At x = 1, f(x) reaches a minimum. - For x in (1, +infty), f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is increasing again.

This is equivalent to the scenario where the number on each arrow is 1. For this setup, we can place the number 1 at each point, and the condition of the problem will be satisfied. 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that for any product of the numbers on the arrows less than a given number n, it is possible to assign natural numbers to each point such that the number on each arrow equals the product of the numbers at its ends. 3. **Induction Step:** Let's consider the product of the numbers on the arrows to be n > 1. Let p be an arbitrary prime divisor of n. We know that p divides the number on some arrow from point A to point B. To advance our proof, we need to show that either: - the numbers on all arrows originating from A are divisible by p, or - the numbers on all arrows ending at B are divisible by p. Let's assume the contrary: there is an arrow from A to point C, the number on which is not divisible by p, and an arrow from point D to B, the number on which is also not divisible by p. 4. **Contradiction:** Consider a closed path A rightarrow B rightarrow D rightarrow C rightarrow A. By the problem's condition, the product of the numbers on the arrows in the direction of movement (from A to B and from D to C) must equal the product of the numbers in the opposite direction (from D to B and from A to C). However, this results in a contradiction because: - the product involving A to B and D to C is divisible by p, - while the product involving D to B and A to C is not divisible by p. 5. **Conclusion from Contradiction:** Since we reach a contradiction, we conclude that either all numbers on arrows from A are divisible by p, or all numbers on arrows to B are divisible by p. 6. **Reducing the Problem:** Suppose all numbers on all arrows from A are divisible by p. Divide these numbers by p. Consider the new configuration. By the induction hypothesis, we know that with this reduced product, we can assign values to each point such that the numbers on the arrows follow the problem's condition. After solving for this reduced problem, increase the number at point A by a factor of p, which maintains the structure required by the problem since we accounted for p in each arrow's multiplication. If instead all numbers on arrows to B are divisible by p, a similar argument applies by dividing and increasing the number at B by a factor of p after solving the reduced problem using the induction hypothesis. This completes the induction step.

The equation representing the total production in June is: 30(P + H) = 4800 We know H is 60, so we can substitute that into the equation: 30(P + 60) = 4800 Now, let's solve for P: 30P + 30(60) = 4800 30P + 1800 = 4800 30P = 4800 - 1800 30P = 3000 P = 3000 / 30 P = 100 So the restaurant makes 100 pizzas every day.

Consequently, the probability that a voter does not approve is P(N) = 1 - P(Y) = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3. 2. **Calculate the Probability for Each Specific Sequence:** We are interested in the cases where exactly one out of three voters approves of the mayor's work.

Base Step 1. **First question (k=1):** - If ( T leq S - n ): - At the first question, A is asked if he knows ( n ). - If ( T leq S - n ), then ( T leq m ) where ( T = m+n-x ) for some ( x ). - A can deduce that ( n leq x leq 0 ). Since ( n ) is positive, this is impossible. - Therefore, ( T ) must actually be ( S = m+n ), and hence A knows the answer. 2. **Second question (k=1):** - If ( T geq S + n ): - At the second question, B is asked if he knows ( m ). - If ( T geq S + n ), then ( T ) is the number such that ( n leq T - S leq T - m ). - B can deduce that ( m leq x leq 0 ). Since ( m ) is positive, this is impossible. - Hence, ( T ) must actually be ( S ) and B knows ( m ). Thus, the claim holds for ( k=1 ). Inductive Step Suppose the claim holds for some integer ( k ). We will show it also holds for ( k+1 ): 3. **Question ( 2k+1 ):** - Suppose ( T leq S - frac{n}{k+1} ): - At question ( 2k+1 ), A is asked if he knows ( n ). - A considers ( T leq S - frac{n}{k+1} ).

This implies: [ S' = T quad and quad T' = S ] Let ( m' = T - n ) and ( n' = n ).

Each of the five players chooses two of five roles they wish to play.

We have five vertices corresponding to the five roles, and an edge between two vertices if a player chooses to play both roles. Given that each of the five players picks two roles, there will be exactly five edges in this graph. 2. **Degrees of Vertices:** We require each one of the five vertices (roles) to have a degree of exactly 2, signifying that each role should be selected by exactly two players. 3. **Possible Graph Configurations:** For the graph to have each role appearing exactly twice, the graph needs to be composed of cycles where each vertex has degree 2. There are two ways we can achieve this: - A single 5-cycle. - A combination of a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle. 4. **Case 1: Single 5-cycle** - **Counting 5-cycles:** To count the number of unique 5-cycles: - Choose an arbitrary vertex to start, and find ways to order the remaining vertices around the cycle.

[ frac{4!}{2} = frac{24}{2} = 12 text{ distinct 5-cycles} ] - **Assigning players to cycles:** Each arrangement of the cycle can have 5! ways to assign players to the edges.

For any positive integer ( k ), ( k ) can be written as ( k = 2^m cdot d ), where ( d ) is an odd integer and ( m ) is a non-negative integer. In this case, ( u(k) = d ). 2. We need to prove that for each ( n in mathbb{N} ), [ frac{1}{2^n} sum_{k=1}^{2^n} frac{u(k)}{k} > frac{2}{3}. ] 3. Consider the sum ( sum_{k=1}^{2^n} frac{u(k)}{k} ). We can group the terms based on the power of 2 in their factorization. Specifically, for each ( k ), let ( nu_2(k) ) denote the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing ( k ). Thus, ( k = 2^m cdot d ) where ( d ) is odd and ( m = nu_2(k) ). 4.

The number of integers ( k ) in the range ( 1 leq k leq 2^n ) with ( nu_2(k) = m ) is ( 2^{n-m-1} ) because for each fixed ( m ), ( d ) can take ( 2^{n-m-1} ) values. 7. Thus, we can rewrite the sum as: [ sum_{k=1}^{2^n} frac{u(k)}{k} = sum_{m=0}^{n} 2^{n-m-1} cdot frac{1}{2^m}. ] 8. Simplifying the inner sum: [ sum_{m=0}^{n} 2^{n-m-1} cdot frac{1}{2^m} = sum_{m=0}^{n} 2^{n-m-1} cdot 2^{-m} = sum_{m=0}^{n} 2^{n-m-1-m} = sum_{m=0}^{n} 2^{n-2m-1}. ] 9.

The series ( sum_{m=0}^{n} frac{1}{4^m} ) is a geometric series with the first term ( a = 1 ) and common ratio ( r = frac{1}{4} ).

Adding the remaining term: [ frac{2}{3} left(1 - frac{1}{4^{n+1}}right) + frac{1}{4^n} = frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{3 cdot 4^n}. ] 14. Since ( frac{1}{3 cdot 4^n} > 0 ), we have: [ frac{2}{3} + frac{1}{3 cdot 4^n} > frac{2}{3}. ] 15.

Clearly, because ( m ) is the largest, it cannot be equal to the difference of its neighbors because the difference can only be less than or equal to these neighbors. Hence, the maximum number ( m ) does not satisfy the given condition. 3. **Consideration of Minimum Number ( d ):** Let ( d ) denote one of the smallest numbers in the circle. We investigate the sequence of numbers on one of the arcs between ( d ) and ( m ). Suppose the sequence of numbers on this arc is given by ( d = a_0, a_1, ldots, a_k = m ). 4. **Proof by Induction - Step 1:** We will prove by induction that ( a_{i+1} geq a_i ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, k-1 ): - Base Case (( i=0 )): By definition, ( a_0 = d ) the smallest number. So the inequality holds. - Induction Hypothesis: Assume ( a_i geq a_{i-1} ) holds for some ( i ). 5. **Proof by Induction - Inductive Step:** Using the fact that each ( a_i ) (for ( i neq k )) satisfies the given condition, we have: [ a_{i+1} = a_i + a_{i-1} ] Since we assume ( a_i geq a_{i-1} ), it follows that ( a_{i+1} > a_i ). Consequently, ( a_i leq a_{i+1} ). 6. **Consideration of the Other Arc:** Similarly, we consider the sequence of numbers on the other arc between ( d ) and ( m ). Suppose the sequence of numbers is given by ( d = b_0, b_1, ldots, b_l = m ). Using a similar induction argument as above, we can show that: [ b_{i+1} = b_i + b_{i-1} ] and thus, ( b_{i+1} geq b_i ). 7. **Combining Both Sequences:** Next, note that the equations hold: [ a_{i+1} = a_i + a_{i-1} ] [ b_{i+1} = b_i + b_{i-1} ] Let us continue these sequences and prove by induction that ( a_i < b_i leq a_{i+1} ): - For ( i = 1 ), ( a_2 = b_1 > a_1 ). - For ( i = 2 ), the inequalities hold as ( b_{0} = a_{0}, b_{1} = a_{2} ). - For ( i geq 3 ), by induction hypothesis ( a_{i-2} < b_{i-2} < b_{i-1} leq a_i ) implies: [ a_i = a_{i-1} + a_{i-2} < b_{i-1} + b_{i-2} = b_i leq a_i + a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} ] 8. **Final Contradiction:** Hence, we have: [ d = a_0 = b_0 leq a_1 < b_1 leq a_2 < b_2 leq ldots ] which implies that the equality ( b_l = a_k ) is possible only if ( k = l+1 ). Thus, the total number of numbers would be ( k + l = 2l + 1 ), which cannot be 300, as 300 is even. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is impossible to arrange 300 positive numbers in such a way that each number, except one, equals the difference of its neighbors.

Since three eggs are missing (one from each of the three underfilled containers), the total number of eggs can be expressed as 15c - 3, where c is the total number of containers. We need to determine the smallest c such that 15c - 3 > 150. This simplifies to 15c > 153, leading to c > 10.2. Since c must be an integer, the smallest possible value for c is 11. Plugging c = 11 into the equation gives us 15(11) - 3 = 165 - 3 = boxed{162}."},{"prompt":"For any value of m, the line (2m+1)x+(m+1)y7m4=0 always passes through a fixed point ______.","completion":"Given (2m+1)x+(m+1)y-7m-4=0, we can rewrite it as (2x+y-7)m+(x+y-4)=0. Therefore, we have 2x+y-7=0, (1) and x+y-4=0, (2). Thus, the graph of the linear function (2m+1)x+(m+1)y-7m-4=0 is independent of m and always passes through a fixed point. Solving equations (1) and (2), we get: x=3, y=1. Therefore, the fixed point is (3,1).

To accommodate 20 more students, the average is decreased by some amount. The total expenditure increased by Rs. 400. The total expenditure of the hostel now is Rs. 5400. By how many rupees did the average decrease?","completion":"Let's denote the original average expenditure per student as A. The total expenditure for 100 students was then 100A. When 20 more students are accommodated, the total number of students becomes 100 + 20 = 120. The new total expenditure is Rs. 5400, which is Rs. 400 more than the original total expenditure. So the original total expenditure was Rs. 5400 - Rs. 400 = Rs. 5000. Therefore, the original average expenditure per student (A) was Rs. 5000 / 100 students = Rs. 50 per student. Now, with the new total expenditure of Rs. 5400 for 120 students, the new average expenditure per student is Rs. 5400 / 120 students = Rs. 45 per student. The decrease in the average expenditure per student is Rs. 50 - Rs. 45 = Rs. 5. So, the average decreased by Rs. boxed{5} ."},{"prompt":"Erik's dog can run 24 miles per hour. It is chasing a rabbit that can run 15 miles per hour. The rabbit has a head start of .6 miles. How many minutes does it take for the dog to catch up to the rabbit?","completion":"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step: 1. **Find the speed of the dog in miles per minute:** - The dog runs at a speed of 24 miles per hour. To convert this speed into miles per minute, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). [ text{Speed of the dog in miles per minute} = frac{24}{60} = 0.4 text{ miles per minute} ] 2. **Find the speed of the rabbit in miles per minute:** - Similarly, the rabbit runs at a speed of 15 miles per hour. Converting this into miles per minute: [ text{Speed of the rabbit in miles per minute} = frac{15}{60} = 0.25 text{ miles per minute} ] 3. **Set up an equation to find when the dog catches up to the rabbit:** - The dog needs to cover the head start of 0.6 miles plus the distance the rabbit runs in the same time. If we let t represent the number of minutes it takes for the dog to catch up, we can set up the following equation: [ 0.4t = 0.25t + 0.6 ] 4. **Solve for t:** - Subtract 0.25t from both sides to get the terms involving t on one side: [ 0.4t - 0.25t = 0.6 ] - Simplify the left side: [ 0.15t = 0.6 ] - Divide both sides by 0.15 to solve for t: [ t = frac{0.6}{0.15} = 4 ] Therefore, it takes the dog boxed{4} minutes to catch up to the rabbit."},{"prompt":"The ages of two persons differ by some years.

What is the ratio of A's share of the profit to B's share of the profit?","completion":"To determine the ratio of A's share of the profit to B's share of the profit, we need to calculate the amount of time each person's capital was invested in the business and then use that to find the ratio of their investments. A invested 3500 for the entire year (12 months). B invested 9000, but only after 5 months had passed, so B's investment was for the remaining 7 months of the year. Now, we calculate the ratio of their investments considering the time each capital was invested: A's investment = 3500 * 12 months = 42000 B's investment = 9000 * 7 months = 63000 Now, we find the ratio of A's investment to B's investment: A's investment : B's investment = 42000 : 63000 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which in this case is 21000: A's investment : B's investment = (42000 / 21000) : (63000 / 21000) A's investment : B's investment = 2 : 3 Therefore, the ratio of A's share of the profit to B's share of the profit is boxed{2:3} ."},{"prompt":"The average weight of 8 persons increases by 3 kg when a new person comes in place of one of them weighing 70 kg.

Represent these numbers in the form they would take in a GP: [ b, bq, bq^2, bq^3, bq^4 ] 4. For these numbers to also form an AP, consider the sequence: [ a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d, a+4d ] 5.

The circle ( k ) with center ( I ) and radius ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2}|AB| ) intersects the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) at two points. Let ( M ) be one of these intersection points.

(FA) and (HA) are face diagonals with lengths equal to (FH). Thus, the triangle (FHA) is equilateral and lies in the plane (S) defined by (e) and (A). 3.

Consider the equation ( (x^2 + x + 2013)^3 + a(x^2 + x + 2013)^2 + b(x^2 + x + 2013) + c = 0 ). Substituting ( y = x^2 + x + 2013 ), we get: [ y^3 + ay^2 + by + c = 0 ] This is equivalent to ( P(y) = 0 ). 3. The problem states that the equation ( y^3 + ay^2 + by + c = 0 ) has no real roots. This implies that ( y = x^2 + x + 2013 ) cannot take any value that is a root of ( P(t) ). 4. Since ( P(t) ) has 3 distinct real roots, denote them by ( r_1, r_2, r_3 ).

We need to count the number of ways we can arrange the natural numbers from 1 to 9 in a 3 times 3 grid such that the sum of the numbers in each row and each column is odd.

The total number of odd numbers in the grid must be an odd number between 3 and 9 inclusive. 2. **Case Analysis** Let's analyze the different cases for the number of odd numbers (k) in the 3 times 3 grid. **Case 1: Three Odd Numbers** - We need to place exactly 3 odd numbers in such a way that each row and each column contains exactly one odd number. - We can choose positions for these 3 odd numbers in 3! = 6 ways. - We have 4 different choices (1, 3, 5, 7) for each of the 6 other cells (even numbers), which gives us 4^6 ways to place even numbers. - We can choose values for the 3 odd places in 5^3 ways (each of the 3 odd places can be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9).

So, total ways for this case: ( 9 times 4^4 times 5^5 ) **Case 3: Seven Odd Numbers** - This situation is impossible because there would be an uneven balance of even and odd numbers which can't satisfy the conditions (there would be columns or rows with two evens or odds disrupting the odd sum condition). **Case 4: Nine Odd Numbers** - All nine cells are filled with odd numbers. - We have 5 choices for each cell among 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.

What is the minimum cost?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Calculating the Transport Capacity of Each Truck Let's denote the capacity of 1 large truck as a tons and the capacity of 1 small truck as b tons. Given the equations from the problem: 1. For 3 large trucks and 4 small trucks: 3a + 4b = 18 2. For 2 large trucks and 6 small trucks: 2a + 6b = 17 Solving these equations simultaneously, we start by multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second by 3 to eliminate a: - 6a + 8b = 36 - 6a + 18b = 51 Subtracting the first from the second gives us 10b = 15, leading to b = 1.5. Substituting b = 1.5 into the first original equation 3a + 4(1.5) = 18 gives us 3a + 6 = 18, thus 3a = 12 and a = 4. Therefore, we find that: - 1 large truck can transport a = 4 tons of goods at once. - 1 small truck can transport b = 1.5 tons of goods at once. Hence, the capacities are boxed{4 text{ tons for a large truck and } 1.5 text{ tons for a small truck}}. Part 2: Minimizing the Transportation Cost Let x be the number of large trucks used, so the number of small trucks used is 10 - x. The total cost, w, in yuan, is given by the equation w = 130x + 100(10 - x) = 30x + 1000. The cost increases with the number of large trucks, so we aim to minimize x while still transporting all 33 tons of goods. The capacity equation is 4x + 1.5(10 - x) geqslant 33. Solving for x, we get 4x + 15 - 1.5x geqslant 33, leading to 2.5x geqslant 18, and thus x geqslant 7.2. Since x must be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a truck), the minimum x that satisfies this condition is x = 8. Calculating the cost for x = 8 large trucks and 10 - 8 = 2 small trucks (though only 1 small truck is needed to meet the tonnage requirement), we find the minimum cost to be w = 130 times 8 + 100 times 2 = 1040 + 80 = 1120 yuan. Therefore, to minimize costs, the transportation company should arrange boxed{8} large trucks and boxed{1} small truck, resulting in a minimum cost of boxed{1120 text{ yuan}}."},{"prompt":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms is denoted by S_n.

From the problem, we know that: 1. C = 0.10 * T (since 10% of the trees cross-pollinated) 2. F + C = 204 (the number of pure Fuji trees plus the cross-pollinated ones) 3. The number of pure Gala trees is 36. We also know that the total number of trees T is the sum of pure Fuji trees (F), pure Gala trees (36), and cross-pollinated trees (C). So we can write: T = F + 36 + C Now, let's substitute C from equation 1 into equation 2: F + 0.10 * T = 204 We can also substitute C from equation 1 into the equation for T: T = F + 36 + 0.10 * T Now we have two equations with two variables (F and T), which we can solve simultaneously. From the second equation, we can isolate F: F = T - 36 - 0.10 * T F = 0.90 * T - 36 Now let's substitute this expression for F into the first equation: 0.90 * T - 36 + 0.10 * T = 204 T = 204 + 36 T = 240 Now that we have T, we can find F: F = 0.90 * T - 36 F = 0.90 * 240 - 36 F = 216 - 36 F = 180 So there are 180 pure Fuji trees.

It is established that for any side of a triangle, the point of tangency of the excircle and the point of tangency of the incircle are reflections of each other over the midpoint of the respective side. This property can be demonstrated using geometric properties or can be referred to from standard geometric texts such as \\"Geometriai feladatok gyű̂jteménye I., problem 645\\". 3.

We denote these perpendicular lines as ( e ), ( f ), and ( g ) respectively (Refer to 2nd figure provided in the reference solution). 4.

Specifically, the line ( f ) passes through the center of the circumcircle, ( K ). Since the line ( e ) is the perpendicular at the point on the incircle touching the side, its reflection over ( K ) would be the line ( g ). 6. The reflection of ( e ) over ( K ) is ( g ), which means ( g ) passes through ( O' ) (because reflecting ( e ) over ( K ) will send the passage line through original ( O ) to ( O' ). 7. Since the above property holds for each of the triangle sides, all perpendiculars drawn at the points of tangency of the excircles with the triangle sides must intersect at the same point ( O' ). Conclusion: Thus, the perpendiculars to the sides of a triangle at the points where the excircles touch these sides all intersect at a single point, which is the reflection of the incenter ( O ) over the circumcenter ( K ). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Toby held a garage sale to raise money to support friends who have lost their jobs.

Is it possible to answer this question precisely without looking into the chests? b) What if there were eight chests, and the stingy knight could evenly distribute the coins in any 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 chests?","completion":"Let's break down the problem into two parts: (a) and (b). Part (a) 1. We have six chests with an unknown total number of gold coins. 2. It is noted that by opening any two chests, we can arrange the coins in those two chests such that each has an equal number of coins. 3. It is also noted that by opening any 3, 4, or 5 chests, we can rearrange the coins among them so that each chest has an equal amount of coins. Given these conditions, the objective is to determine if it is possible to evenly distribute all the coins across all six chests without looking into the chests. Let's use two different methods to solve this: **First Method:** 1. **Divide into pairs**: Divide the six chests into three pairs. Let's call the pairs ( (A, B), (C, D), (E, F) ). 2. Since the number of coins in each pair can be equally divided, the total number of coins in each pair must be even. Since there are three pairs, the sum of coins in all six chests is also even. 3. **Divide into two groups of three**: Next, divide the six chests into two groups of three. For example, group 1 can be ( (A, C, E) ) and group 2 can be ( (B, D, F) ). 4. Given the conditions, the total number of coins in each group of three can be evenly divided. Hence, the sum of the coins in each group of three must be a multiple of three. 5. Therefore, the total number of coins in all six chests must be both even and a multiple of three, implying it must be a multiple of 6. Hence, the total number of coins must be divisible by 6, making it possible to evenly distribute the coins among the six chests. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{text{Yes, it is possible}} ] **Second Method:** 1. **Parity of coins**: Consider the total parity (odd or even) of coins in all chests. Since we can always distribute equally, the number of coins must maintain the same parity in all combinations of chest openings. 2. Open the first three chests (say (A, B, C)): ) The total number of coins among these three chests must be divisible by 3. 3. Repeat this for any combination of 3 chests among the six given chests. 4.

The objective is to determine if it is possible to evenly distribute all the coins across all eight chests under the given conditions. **Logical Discussions:** 1. **Divisibility by common denominations**: - Similar to part (a), by opening and dividing coins equally among 2 chests, the total number of coins should be even. - Opening any combination of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 chests will ensure that the total number of coins gives the same remainder when divided by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. - The common multiple of (2, 3, 4, 5, 6,) and ( 7) is ( text{LCM}(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) = 420 ), which means the total number of coins should be equivalent modulo 420. 2. **Distribution across eight chests**: - The 420 divides aren’t necessarily compatible with splitting evenly across 8 parts (since 420 is not divisible by 8). - Therefore under the constraints, the answer is not guaranteed since certain prime factors might obstruct even distribution. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{text{No, it is not possible}} ]"},{"prompt":"Compute sin 150^circ.","completion":"Let Q be the point on the unit circle that corresponds to an angle of 150^circ measured counterclockwise from the point (1,0).

Since the masses are distinct and listed in increasing order, it can be observed that: [m_1 + m_3 + m_5 + m_7 < m_2 + m_4 + m_6 + m_8] This inequality holds strictly because for any two corresponding masses (m_i) from Group 1 and (m_{i+1}) from Group 2, the inequality (m_i < m_{i+1}) always holds. 4.

Note that initially, we have 2019 units. 2. **Recursive Relationship:** Considering how we can obtain (m_n), we realize: [ m_n = min left{ frac{m_p + m_q}{4} mid p+q = n, p, q in mathbb{N}, text{ and } p, q geq 1 right} ] This relation expresses (m_n) in terms of the minimum values obtainable from any sums of parts that add up to (n). 3. **Initial Cases Evaluation:** Let's compute values for small (n): - For ( n = 1): ( m_1 = 1 ) since there's no operation needed. - For ( n = 2): ( m_2 = frac{1+1}{4} = frac{2}{4} = frac{1}{2} ) - For ( n = 3): Possible splits are (1, 2): [ m_3 = frac{m_1 + m_2}{4} = frac{1 + frac{1}{2}}{4} = frac{frac{3}{2}}{4} = frac{3}{8} ] 4. **General Formula Derivation Using Induction:** Suppose for (n leq n_0), (m_n = frac{3cdot 2^k - n}{2^{k+1}}) where (k = lfloor log_2(n) rfloor). 5. **Verify the Formula:** [ begin{aligned} &text{For } n = 1: m_1 = 1 = frac{3 cdot 1 - 1}{2} = frac{2}{2} = 1 &text{For } n = 2: m_2 = frac{3 cdot 2 - 2}{4} = frac{4}{4} = 1 &text{For } n = 3: m_3 = frac{3 cdot 2 - 3}{4} = frac{3}{8} end{aligned} ] 6. **Inductive Step:** Assume the formula holds for ( n = n_0 ). For ( n = n_0 + 1 ): [ begin{aligned} m_{n_0+1} &= min left{ frac{m_p + m_q}{4} mid p+q = n_0+1 right} &leq frac{2m_{lfloor frac{n_0+1}{2} rfloor}}{4} &= frac{2cdot frac{3cdot 2^k - lfloor frac{n_0+1}{2} rfloor }{2^{k+1}}}{4} quad (text{with appropriate k}) end{aligned} ] This confirms the formula extends. 7. **Apply for (n = 2019):** Determine (k = lfloor log_2(2019) rfloor = 10). Compute (m_{2019}): [ m_{2019} = frac{3 cdot 2^{10} - 2019}{2^{11}} = frac{3072 - 2019}{2048} = frac{1053}{2048} ] **Conclusion:** The smallest number that can remain on the board after 2018 operations, starting with 2019 ones, is [ boxed{frac{1053}{2048}} ]"},{"prompt":") Prove that among all convex curves of diameter 1, the curves of constant width 1 have the greatest length. b) Let ( AB ) and ( PQ ) be two parallel chords of a curve ( bar{K} ) of constant width ( D ), such that the diagonals ( AQ ) and ( BP ) of the trapezoid ( ABQP ) are diameters of the curve.

Therefore, the convex curve ( K ) with diameter 1 that has the maximum length is a curve of constant width 1. # Part (b): 1. **Let ( K ) be a convex curve with diameter ( D ) and width ( Delta ):** - Suppose ( AB ) and ( PQ ) are two parallel chords of the curve ( bar{K} ) of constant width ( D ) spaced at a distance ( Delta ). - Denote the distance between these parallel lines as ( Delta ): - The chords ( AB ) and ( PQ ) form a trapezoid ( ABQP ). 2. **Diagonal property within trapezoid:** - The diagonals ( AQ ) and ( BP ) of the trapezoid ( ABPQ ) are also diameters of the curve. 3. **Curve ( K ) with segments ( AP ) and ( BQ ):** - Define ( K ) as the curve formed by arcs ( AP ) and ( BQ ) from ( bar{K} ) and chords ( AB ) and ( PQ ). 4. **Proving longest length condition:** - We need to show that the curve ( K ) formed in this manner has the largest possible length among all convex curves with diameter ( D ) and width ( Delta ). - When we form the central symmetric curve ( K^* = K + K' ), it will have diameter ( 2D ) and width ( 2Delta ), which means that ( K^* ) will be exactly enclosed within a circle of radius ( D ). - Since ( K* ) is centrally symmetric, it is bounded by these parallel supporting lines spaced ( 2Delta ) apart. 5. **Summarizing properties and conclusion:** - Combining the results shows that the form of curve ( K ) with given properties matches the one from ( bar{K} ) from arcs and chords. - As shown, curve ( K ) encased in ( K^* = K + K' ) fits within the indicated confines of drawn illustrations and constraint equations. Hence, the curve ( K ) incorporating ( AP ) and ( BQ ) segments among the arcs and chords forms the longest convex curve of diameter ( D ) and width ( Delta ).

Since overline{BD} bisects angle BAC, angles angle ABD = angle DBC = 36^circ. To find angle ABC, we look at triangle ABD.

Prove that Person B only needs to provide no more than 20 numbers to ensure the game can be terminated.","completion":"The goal is to ensure乙 (Yi) can stop the game by providing at most 20 numbers. Let's break down the problem and the reference solution in a more detailed manner. 1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:** - 甲 (Jia) starts by selecting a number ( A_1 ). - 乙 (Yi) responds with a number ( B_1 ). - 甲 (Jia) then decides to either add ( A_1 ) and ( B_1 ) or subtract the smaller from the larger to get ( A_2 ). - This process repeats with ( A_2, B_2, ) and so on. The game ends if ( A_i ) is of the form ( 10^k ) (i.e., a power of 10). 2. **Strategy Analysis:** - We can ignore trailing zeros of ( A_i ). - This means the significant digits dominate the calculations, which helps in choosing strategic ( B_i ). 3. **Procedure to Select ( B_i ):** - Suppose ( 2A_i ) in decimal representation is ( 2A_i = overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_n} ). - Let ( k = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ). - Define: [ x_i = overline{a_1 a_2 cdots a_k 0 cdots 0} ] [ y_i = overline{a_{k+1} a_{k+2} cdots a_n} ] - Then set: [ B_i = frac{1}{2}(x_i - y_i). ] 4. **Resulting Relationships:** - From the definitions, we derive: [ A_i + B_i = x_i ] [ A_i - B_i = y_i. ] Hence, ( A_{i+1} ) will either be ( x_i ) or ( y_i ). 5. **Digit Length Reduction Analysis:** - Since ( 2A_i ) can have utmost one more digit than ( A_i ): - Suppose ( A_i ) has ( n ) digits. - ( A_{i+1} ) will have at most ( leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1 ) digits. - Therefore, after 10 operations: [ text{Digit count reduces approximately as: } 1000, 501, 251, 126, 64, 33, 17, 9, 5, 3, 2. ] - This ensures ( A_{11} ) has at most 2 digits. When ( A ) reduces to a two-digit number: - If it is a three-digit number (with leading digit being 1), ( A_{12} ) will continue reducing until it's a one-digit number. 6. **Stopping the Game in ≤ 5 Moves with a One-Digit Number:** - As shown, reducing a one-digit number to a power of 10 (1 or 10) will take at most 5 operations. - For example, consider ( A = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ). Selecting ( B = {4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 2} ): - ( A = 3 rightarrow (A+B) = 7 rightarrow ldots rightarrow 100 rightarrow 10 ) - ( A = 4 rightarrow (A+B) = 7 rightarrow ldots rightarrow 100 rightarrow 10 ) - ( A = 9 rightarrow (B = 4) = 13 rightarrow 100 rightarrow 10 ) - Remaining cases are similar. 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, by using this strategy, 乙 (Yi) can ensure to provide at most 17 numbers to stop the game within 20 moves.

The maximum number of flies Sharik can relocate is left(n-1-1right) = n-2 flies for every cutlet positioning. 6. **Accumulated Flies**: Therefore, as Sharik proceeds to eat these first n cutlets, the flies initially located on c_n will move to cutlets indexed higher than n during these first million moves.

This means there exists an integer ( a ) such that ( a^2 equiv -1 pmod{p} ). - By Wilson's theorem, ((p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p}). Additionally, ((p-1)! equiv left( left( frac{p-1}{2} right)! right)^2 (-1)^{(p-1)/2} equiv -1 pmod{p}). This implies that ( a = left( frac{p-1}{2} right)! ) satisfies ( a^2 equiv -1 pmod{p} ). 2. **Lifting the Solution to Higher Powers of ( p )**: - We need to show that if ( a^2 equiv -1 pmod{p} ), then we can find ( a_n ) such that ( a_n^2 + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p^n} ) for all ( n geq 1 ). **Base Case**: - For ( n = 2 ), let ( a_2 = pk + a ) where ( a^2 + 1 = pell ).

Choose ( k ) such that ( k equiv -ell(2a)^{-1} pmod{p} ). Since ( p > 2 ) and ( (a, p) = 1 ), ( 2a ) has a well-defined inverse modulo ( p ). Thus, the base case is complete. **Inductive Step**: - Assume ( a_{n-1} ) satisfies ( a_{n-1}^2 + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p^{n-1}} ). Let ( a_n = p^{n-1}k_n + a_{n-1} ). Then, [ a_n^2 + 1 equiv (p^{n-1}k_n + a_{n-1})^2 + 1 equiv p^{2(n-1)}k_n^2 + 2p^{n-1}k_na_{n-1} + a_{n-1}^2 + 1 equiv 2p^{n-1}k_na_{n-1} + a_{n-1}^2 + 1 pmod{p^n}. ] - Since ( a_{n-1}^2 + 1 equiv 0 pmod{p^{n-1}} ), we have ( a_{n-1}^2 + 1 = p^{n-1}ell_{n-1} ).

Consider the parallelogram (ABCD) by its vertices. We are required to find a line that parallel to one of its diagonals divides the parallelogram into two regions such that one is twice the area of the other. 2. Since the diagonal (BD) is parallel to the line we are looking for, the problem is equivalent to finding a line parallel to (BD) that divides the parallelogram such that the area ratio is (2:3). This can be restated in terms of triangle areas. 3. Focus on triangle (BCD). The new line we seek must divide (BCD) into two regions, one which is (frac{2}{3}) of the area of (BCD). 4. To achieve this, we construct a semicircle over (BC) and divide it into three equal parts. 5. Let's say the point (C') divides the semicircle such that the line drawn from (B) through (C') is perpendicular to (BC). The segment (XC) (where (X) lies on (BC)) is such that the length (CX = CC'). 6. It follows that: [ CC' = BC cdot sqrt{frac{2}{3}} ] This step involves the calculation of the lengths by using the property of the triangle and the equilibrium points of the semicircle. 7. Considering the geometry further: [ CX = BC cdot sqrt{frac{2}{3}} ] which simplifies down to: [ (CX)^2 = frac{2}{3}BC^2 ] 8. This divides the parallelogram such that area relations preserve: [ XCY : BCD = frac{2}{3}: 1 = 2: 3 ] Conclusion: [Complete the constructed parallelogram (XCY) in the required area ratio by drawing a line parallel to (BD) passing through point (X)] Hence, the final solution to the problem is given by the described geometric construction using a semicircle over (BC) and perpendicular division.

Every rational point on the x-axis is on some circle in ( C ). 2. Any two circles in ( C ) intersect at most once. Step-by-step Proof: 1. **Choosing the circles**: We will extract a set of circles that satisfy property (1). For each rational point on the x-axis ((r, 0)), where (r) can be uniquely written as (frac{p}{q}) with (p) and (q) being coprime integers and (q > 0), we shall consider the circles with centers at (left(frac{p}{q}, tright)) and radius (t), where (t) is a positive rational number to be determined. 2. **Equation of circles**: The equation for a circle centered at (left(frac{p}{q}, tright)) with radius (t) is: [ left(x - frac{p}{q}right)^2 + left(y - tright)^2 = t^2 ] 3. **Intersection with the x-axis**: Since the circle intersects the x-axis, substituting (y = 0) into the circle's equation we get: [ left(frac{p}{q} - xright)^2 + t^2 = t^2 implies x = frac{p}{q} ] Therefore, every rational point on the x-axis is on some circle in (C), satisfying property (1). 4. **Ensuring any two circles intersect at most once**: To ensure property (2), we need to choose (t) values such that any two circles intersect at most once. Assume there are two circles centered at (left(frac{p}{q}, tright)) and (left(frac{p'}{q'}, t'right)) that intersect at more than one point. Then, the distance between their centers should be less than the sum of their radii: [ left(frac{p}{q} - frac{p'}{q'}right)^2 + (t - t')^2 < t^2 + t'^2 ] 5. **Simplifying the inequality**: Substituting (t = frac{1}{2q^2}) and (t' = frac{1}{2q'^2}), the inequality becomes: [ left(frac{p}{q} - frac{p'}{q'}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{2q^2} - frac{1}{2q'^2}right)^2 < left(frac{1}{2q^2}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{2q'^2}right)^2 ] After simplification, this inequality simplifies to: [ left(pq' - p'qright)^2 < 1 ] 6. **Analyzing the inequality**: Since (p, q, p', q') are integers and relatively prime, the quantity (pq' - p'q) is also an integer. Thus, ((pq' - p'q)^2 < 1 implies pq' - p'q = 0). This implies that (frac{p}{q} = frac{p'}{q'}). 7. **Contradiction**: Given (p, q) coprime, and (p', q') coprime, with (q, q'>0), the equality (frac{p}{q} = frac{p'}{q'}) means (p = p') and (q = q'), a contradiction since we assumed different centers. 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the collection of circles (left{left.left(x-frac{p}{q}right)^2 + left(y-frac{1}{2q^2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4q^4}right| p, q text{ are coprime integers, } q > 0right}) satisfies both properties: [ C = left{left.left(x - frac{p}{q}right)^2 + left(y - frac{1}{2q^2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4q^4}right| p, q text{ are coprime integers, } q > 0right} ] blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A certain percentage of the reporters for a wire service cover local politics in country x.

At this point, the sum of the other three digits in odd positions is: 28 - (9 + 7) = 12, and the sum of the other three digits in even positions is: 17 - (8 + 6) = 3. Thus, the other three digits in even positions can only be 2, 1, 0; hence, the other three digits in odd positions are 5, 4, 3. From this, we get the largest ten-digit number as 9876524130. Let the smallest number sought be 102abcdefg. According to the property of numbers divisible by 11, we have: (sum of digits) - (1 + 2 + b + d + f) times 2 is divisible by 11 or equals 0. Therefore, 39 - (b + d + f) times 2 is divisible by 11 or equals 0. Since b, d, f can only take values from 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, we have -9 leq 39 - (b + d + f) times 2 leq 15. Therefore, 39 - (b + d + f) times 2 = 11 or 0. When 39 - (b + d + f) times 2 = 0, there is no solution. When 39 - (b + d + f) times 2 = 11, b + d + f = 14. It is evident that the combination of b, d, f is either 3, 4, 7 or 3, 5, 6: 1. When the combination of b, d, f is 3, 4, 7, the corresponding combination of a, c, e, g is 5, 6, 8, 9, resulting in the smallest number being 1025364879; 2. When the combination of b, d, f is 3, 5, 6, the corresponding combination of a, c, e, g is 4, 7, 8, 9, resulting in the smallest number being 1024375869. Therefore, the difference between the largest and smallest ten-digit numbers is: 9876524130 - 1024375869 = boxed{8852148261}."},{"prompt":"A pirate is now searching for buried treasure on 8 islands.

There are no other whole points inside, on the edges, or on the faces of the polyhedron. We need to prove that the number of vertices does not exceed eight. 2. **Identify possible integer coordinate points**: Each coordinate of an integer point can either be even or odd. Since there are three coordinates (x, y, z), each having two possible parities (even or odd), the number of different combinations of coordinates (even or odd) is: [ 2^3 = 8 ] Hence, there are at most eight distinct types of points based on the parity (evenness or oddness) of their coordinates. 3. **Using the pigeonhole principle**: If the polyhedron had more than eight vertices (i.e., at least nine), then by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these vertices must share the same parity for all three coordinates. 4. **Construct the midpoint of vertices sharing the same parity**: Consider two vertices ( A = (x_1, y_1, z_1) ) and ( B = (x_2, y_2, z_2) ) that share the same parity for all coordinates. Then the midpoint ( M ) of the line segment joining these two vertices has coordinates: [ M = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}, frac{z_1 + z_2}{2} right) ] 5. **Verify ( M ) is an integer point**: Since ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) are both either even or odd, their sum ( x_1 + x_2 ) is even, making (frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} ) an integer (whole number). The same holds true for ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ), and ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ). Therefore, ( M ) is an integer point. 6. **Contradiction**: The midpoint ( M ) of an edge of the polyhedron being an integer point contradicts the problem's condition that there are no other whole points on the edges of the polyhedron. 7. **Conclusion**: Consequently, it is impossible for the polyhedron to have nine or more vertices.

To solve this, we proceed as follows: First, we recognize that in an arithmetic sequence, the average of two terms equidistant from the middle term is equal to the middle term itself. This property will help us simplify the given expression. Given frac{S_n}{T_n}=frac{n+1}{n+3}, we aim to express the given fractions in terms of S_5 and T_5 to utilize this relationship. Starting with frac{a_2}{b_1+b_5}+frac{a_4}{b_2+b_4}, we observe that b_1 + b_5 = 2b_3 and b_2 + b_4 = 2b_3 due to the property of arithmetic sequences, where b_3 is the middle term of b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5. This simplification is possible because in an arithmetic sequence, the sum of the first and last term, the second and second-to-last term, and so on, are all equal when the sequence has an odd number of terms. Thus, we can rewrite the expression as: [ frac{a_2}{2b_3} + frac{a_4}{2b_3} = frac{1}{2}left(frac{a_2}{b_3} + frac{a_4}{b_3}right) ] Next, we notice that a_2 and a_4 are symmetrically around a_3 in the sequence {a_n}, so their average is a_3.

Since a_3 and b_3 are terms in their respective sequences, their ratio can be represented by the ratio of the sums of their sequences, specifically when n=5: [ frac{a_3}{b_3} = frac{S_5}{T_5} ] Given frac{S_n}{T_n} = frac{n+1}{n+3}, we substitute n=5 into this formula to find: [ frac{S_5}{T_5} = frac{5+1}{5+3} = frac{6}{8} = frac{3}{4} ] Therefore, the original expression frac{a_2}{b_1+b_5}+frac{a_4}{b_2+b_4} simplifies to frac{3}{4}.

So, we can conclude A is not the correct choice. 2. **Finding Zeros of g(x)**: To find the zeros of g(x) = sin(2x - frac{π}{3}), we set it equal to zero: [ sin(2x - frac{π}{3}) = 0 Rightarrow 2x - frac{π}{3} = kπ, quad k in mathbb{Z} ] Solving for x gives: [ x = frac{π}{6} + frac{kπ}{2}, quad k in mathbb{Z} ] Within the interval (0, 3pi), the values of x that satisfy this are frac{π}{6}, frac{2π}{3}, frac{7π}{6}, frac{5π}{3}, frac{13π}{6}, frac{8π}{3}. This means there are 6 zeros, making statement B correct. 3. **Symmetry Axis of g(x)**: To check if x = frac{2π}{3} is a symmetry axis, we evaluate g(frac{2π}{3}): [ gleft(frac{2π}{3}right) = sinleft(frac{4π}{3} - frac{π}{3}right) = sinleft(frac{3π}{3}right) = sin(π) = 0 ] However, just because g(frac{2π}{3}) = 0 does not imply x = frac{2π}{3} is a symmetry axis. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. 4. **Inequality Involving g(x) and a**: Given g(x) - a geq fleft(frac{5π}{12}right) for all x in left[-frac{π}{6}, frac{π}{2}right], we know: [ fleft(frac{5π}{12}right) = sinleft(2 cdot frac{5π}{12}right) = sinleft(frac{5π}{6}right) = frac{1}{2} ] Thus, we have a leq g(x) - frac{1}{2} for all x in left[-frac{π}{6}, frac{π}{2}right].

Prove that the city can be divided into 1014 districts in such a way that streets only connect squares from different districts, and for any two districts, all streets connecting them are directed uniformly (either all from the first district to the second, or all vice versa).","completion":"1. We aim to show that the squares can be colored in 13 colors such that it is impossible to travel from any square to another square of the same color via fewer than three streets. 2. Let's consider an auxiliary directed graph where the vertices represent squares, and there is a directed edge from vertex (A) to vertex (B) if there is a path in the city from square (A) to square (B) passing through at most two streets. 3. First, observe the structure of the auxiliary graph: - Each vertex corresponds to a square. - Each directed edge signifies a path going through up to two streets. 4. Importantly, in this graph, each square (vertex) is connected by no more than 6 edges because: - There are initially 2 outgoing streets from each square. - Each outgoing street from a square leads to another square, which can then lead to up to 2 more squares. Thus, we have at most (2 times 2 + 2) (initial streets count) = 6 connections. 5. Our goal is to show that the vertices of this graph can be colored with 13 colors such that no vertex can reach another vertex of the same color via fewer than 3 streets. - By induction on the number of vertices in the graph, we prove the 13-coloring is possible. 6. **Base Case**: If the graph has 13 or fewer vertices, it's trivial to color them distinctively using 13 colors. 7. **Inductive Step**: Assume that for any graph with (n) vertices, this can be done. We will prove it holds for (n + 1) vertices. - Given any vertex in this directed graph, at most 6 edges are directed from it. There must be a vertex connected to at most 6 other vertices because not all of them could form 7 or more connections per vertex in finite (n). - Remove this vertex and apply the inductive assumption on the remaining (n) vertices graph, resulting in a 13-coloring. 8. Add the removed vertex back to the graph: - Since it connects to at most 6 other vertices, we assign a color from our 13-color palette that does not match the colors of these 6 neighbors. 9. To finalize the town division into 1014 districts: - Label each square by its color. There are 13 colors by our coloring scheme. - Squares of the same color have up to 78 distinct types, based on which colors the streets lead to. 10. To find these 78 subtypes: - A square connects to squares of 2 different colors, and there are ({12 choose 2} + 12 = 12 cdot 11 / 2 + 12 = 66 + 12 = 78) possible combinations. 11. Thus, this division will yield (13 times 78 = 1014) districts. 12. Finally, prove this division ensures that every street connects different districts: - Assume a contradiction: there is a district pair ((a1, a2)) in one district and ((b1, b2)) in another such that: - A street goes from (a1) to (b1) and another from (b2) to (a2). - If streets connect back, it would imply the presence of a path within fewer than 3 streets in the same district, violating our chosen coloring. # Conclusion: [ boxed{1014} ]"},{"prompt":"Determine if there exist positive real numbers x, alpha , so that for any nonempty finite set of positive integers S , the inequality [left|xsum_{sin S}frac{1}{s}right|>frac{1}{max(S)^alpha}] holds, where max(S) is defined as the maximum element of the finite set S .","completion":"To determine if there exist positive real numbers ( x ) and ( alpha ) such that for any non-empty finite set of positive integers ( S ), the inequality [ left|x - sum_{s in S} frac{1}{s} right| > frac{1}{max(S)^alpha} ] holds, we will proceed by contradiction. 1. **Assume the existence of such ( x ) and ( alpha )**: Suppose there exist positive real numbers ( x ) and ( alpha ) such that the inequality holds for any non-empty finite set ( S ) of positive integers. 2. **Consider the harmonic series**: The harmonic series is given by ( H_n = sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{k} ).

Then, ( sum_{s in S} frac{1}{s} = H_n ) and ( max(S) = n ). 4. **Analyze the inequality**: For the inequality to hold, we need: [ left| x - H_n right| > frac{1}{n^alpha} ] As ( n ) increases, ( H_n ) grows without bound. Therefore, for sufficiently large ( n ), ( H_n ) will eventually exceed any fixed ( x ). 5. **Behavior of ( H_n ) relative to ( x )**: Since ( H_n ) diverges, there will be some ( n ) such that ( H_n > x ). For such ( n ), we have: [ H_n - x > frac{1}{n^alpha} ] However, as ( n ) becomes very large, ( frac{1}{n^alpha} ) approaches 0. This means that the difference ( H_n - x ) must be greater than an increasingly small positive number, which is not possible because ( H_n ) can be made arbitrarily close to ( x ) by choosing a sufficiently large ( n ). 6. **Contradiction**: The assumption that such ( x ) and ( alpha ) exist leads to a contradiction because ( H_n ) can be made arbitrarily close to ( x ), violating the inequality ( left| x - H_n right| > frac{1}{n^alpha} ).

This means that M is the midpoint of both OH and IN. - Let X and Y be the midpoints of segments HN and HO, respectively. Clearly, XY parallel ON because X and Y are midpoints of segments that are homothetic images of each other. - Now, consider the quadrilateral IONX. Since X and Y are midpoints, IONX forms a parallelogram. Thus, IX parallel ON. - Hence, points I, X, and Y lie on a line parallel to ON. - Finally, we have: [ angle MON = 90^circ iff IY perp OH iff overline{IY} text{ is the perpendicular bisector of segment } OH iff IO = IH ] 3. **Proving IO = IH if and only if one of the triangle’s angles is 60^circ:** - Consider the Euler line of triangle ABC, which passes through O, G (the centroid), and H. - The distance between the circumcenter O and the orthocenter H is given by OH = 2R cos A cos B cos C, where R is the circumradius. - The distance between the incenter I and the circumcenter O is given by IO^2 = R^2 - 2Rr, where r is the inradius. - For IO = IH, we need: [ R^2 - 2Rr = 2R cos A cos B cos C ] - This equation holds if and only if one of the angles of the triangle is 60^circ. Specifically, if angle A = 60^circ, then cos A = frac{1}{2}, and the equation simplifies to: [ R^2 - 2Rr = 2R left(frac{1}{2}right) cos B cos C ] which is true if cos B cos C = frac{1}{2}, a condition satisfied by the angles of a triangle with one angle equal to 60^circ.

Using the identity for the product of two sums of squares, we have [ (1 + x_1^2)(1 + x_2^2) = 1 cdot 1 + 1 cdot x_2^2 + x_1^2 cdot 1 + x_1^2 cdot x_2^2 = 1 + x_2^2 + x_1^2 + (x_1 x_2)^2. ] Observing the terms, we notice that: [ 1 + x_2^2 + x_1^2 + x_1^2 x_2^2 = (1 + x_1^2 x_2^2) + (x_1^2 + x_2^2) = (1 + x_1 x_2)^2 + (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1 x_2. ] By Euler's four-square identity and Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity, any sum of squares can be represented as a sum of squares of integers. 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds true for (k) terms, and consider (k+1) terms. The induction hypothesis states that the product of (k) terms ((1 + x_1^2)(1 + x_2^2) cdots (1 + x_k^2)) can be expressed as the sum of squares of two integers, say (a^2 + b^2). Now consider the product of these (k) terms with an additional ((1 + x_{k+1}^2)): [ (a^2 + b^2)(1 + x_{k+1}^2). ] By the identity for the product of sums of squares: [ (a^2 + b^2)(1 + x_{k+1}^2) = a^2(1 + x_{k+1}^2) + b^2(1 + x_{k+1}^2). ] Rearranging the terms and simplifying: [ a^2 + a^2 x_{k+1}^2 + b^2 + b^2 x_{k+1}^2 = (a^2 + b^2) + (a x_{k+1})^2 + (b x_{k+1})^2. ] This simplified form indicates that the product can still be expressed as a sum of two squares. Therefore, by induction, the product (left(1 + x_{1}^{2}right) left(1 + x_{2}^{2}right) cdots left(1 + x_{n}^{2}right)) can always be represented as a sum of squares of two integers. # Conclusion Therefore, we have proven that the product (left(1+x_{1}^{2}right) cdots left(1+x_{n}^{2}right)) can always be expressed as a sum of two squares of integers. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"is found that the sum of the squares of any five consecutive integers is a multiple of 5.

The work rate is the fraction of the work done in one day. When the man works alone, he can complete the work in 4 days, so his work rate is 1/4 of the work per day. When the man and his son work together, they can complete the work in 3 days, so their combined work rate is 1/3 of the work per day. The combined work rate of the man and his son is the sum of their individual work rates: M + S = 1/3 We already know that the man's work rate (M) is 1/4, so we can substitute that into the equation: 1/4 + S = 1/3 Now, we need to solve for S, the son's work rate. To do this, we'll subtract the man's work rate from the combined work rate: S = 1/3 - 1/4 To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case: S = (4/12) - (3/12) S = 1/12 So, the son's work rate is boxed{1/12} of the work per day.

By Vieta's formulas, we have: [ z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = -alpha ] [ z_1z_2 + z_2z_3 + z_3z_1 = beta ] [ z_1z_2z_3 = -gamma ] 4. **Negative Real Parts**: Since all roots have negative real parts, we can write ( z_1 = -m ), ( z_2 = -n + pi ), and ( z_3 = -n - pi ) where ( m, n > 0 ) and ( p in mathbb{R} ). 5. **Sum of Roots**: Using Vieta's formulas: [ z_1 + z_2 + z_3 = -m + (-n + pi) + (-n - pi) = -m - 2n ] Therefore, ( -alpha = -m - 2n ) which implies: [ alpha = m + 2n ] 6. **Product of Roots Taken Two at a Time**: [ z_1z_2 + z_2z_3 + z_3z_1 = (-m)(-n + pi) + (-n + pi)(-n - pi) + (-n - pi)(-m) ] [ = mn - mpi + n^2 + p^2 + mn - mpi = mn + n^2 + p^2 ] Therefore, ( beta = mn + n^2 + p^2 ). 7. **Product of All Roots**: [ z_1z_2z_3 = (-m)(-n + pi)(-n - pi) = -m(n^2 + p^2) ] Therefore, ( -gamma = -mn^2 - mp^2 ) which implies: [ gamma = mn^2 + mp^2 ] 8. **Proving ( ab > 0 )**: [ ab = a cdot b = a cdot (a(m + 2n)) = a^2(m + 2n) ] Since ( a neq 0 ) and ( m + 2n > 0 ), we have: [ ab > 0 ] 9. **Proving ( ad > 0 )**: [ ad = a cdot d = a cdot (a(mn^2 + mp^2)) = a^2(mn^2 + mp^2) ] Since ( a neq 0 ) and ( mn^2 + mp^2 > 0 ), we have: [ ad > 0 ] 10. **Proving ( bc - ad > 0 )**: [ bc - ad = a(m + 2n) cdot a(mn + n^2 + p^2) - a^2(mn^2 + mp^2) ] [ = a^2 left[ (m + 2n)(mn + n^2 + p^2) - (mn^2 + mp^2) right] ] [ = a^2 left[ mn^2 + mn^2 + 2n^2 + mp^2 + 2np^2 - mn^2 - mp^2 right] ] [ = a^2 left[ 2mn^2 + 2n^2 + 2np^2 right] ] [ = 2a^2 (mn^2 + n^2 + np^2) ] Since ( a neq 0 ) and ( mn^2 + n^2 + np^2 > 0 ), we have: [ bc - ad > 0 ] (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Suppose you find a box with the following inscription on the lid: I made this box To what conclusion would you come based on this inscription?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Statement on the Box:** - The box has an inscription that reads: \\"I made this box.\\" - The inscription suggests that the statement is a claim of the box's maker. 2. **Assessing the Truthfulness of the Statement:** - We assume the statement on the box is truthful until proven otherwise. - By accepting the statement as true, we acknowledge that whoever wrote the statement indeed made the box. 3. **Identifying the Possible Makers:** - The problem provides the information that either Bellini or Bellini's son could have made the box. - Therefore, the truthful statement \\"I made this box\\" must come from one of these two people. 4. **Concluding the Logical Deduction:** - Given that the statement is true and the only candidates proposed (as per the inscribed statement and the problem context) are Bellini or Bellini's son, it follows logically that: - The box must have been made either by Bellini or by Bellini's son. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The box was made either by Bellini or his son.}} ]"},{"prompt":"The school is planning a field trip.

Other players are called \\"non-persistent.\\" 2. **Total Number of Players and Matches**: - Let the total number of players be (n > 4). - Each match played is unique, and each player competes against every other player once. This implies there are (binom{n}{2}) matches in total. - The total number of tournament days is thus (binom{n}{2} / frac{n}{2} = n-1) (since two players compete per match). 3. **Persistent Players and Their Wins**: - By the last day, all persistent players must have won their matches as indicated. - Let (k) be the number of persistent players. Since they all win on the last day, (k leq n/2) (there can be at most (n/2) persistent players because at least half of the players they play must lose). 4. **Considering (k) Non-Persistent Players**: - We analyze the hypothesis that persistent players ((k)) constitute exactly half of all players, i.e., (k = n/2). 5. **Tournament Duration and Match Configuration**: - Such a tournament runs for (2k - 1) days. - We need to demonstrate that there were at least (k) days on which there was a match between non-persistent players. - It is equivalent to showing there were at least (k) days with matches between persistent players as well. 6. **Proof by Contradiction**: - Suppose the number of days with matches between non-persistent players was less than (k). Hence, days involving matches between persistent players were also less than (k) due to symmetry in tournament rules (note: persistent players need to play each other too). - Each persistent player plays against (k-1) other persistent players in (k-1) days. - Any matchday without persistent vs. persistent means all persistent players would have to play amongst themselves, which necessitates matches involving only persistent players overflowing (k-1) days—leading to contradiction because it crosses allowable days. 7. **Minimum Number Consideration**: - Given (2k > 4) implies (k > 2) and since (k) is an integer, we have (k geq 4). - This means among the non-persistent set, daily contests requiring persistent player outcomes contradict the persistence requirement having exactly (k-1) matches among themselves. 8. **Conclusion**: - Matches between non-persistent players must occur less, meeting in the strict boundaries aligning to (k), ensuring contradiction thus invalidating fewer meetings premise. Therefore, the number of days with matches between non-persistent players is at least half the days of the tournament.

Let the angle bisector from vertex (C) intersect side (AB) at point (E) and diagonal (BD) at point (F). Let (O) be the intersection point of the diagonals. 2. Notice that due to the angle bisector, we have ( angle BEC = angle CEA ). Additionally, since triangles (EOB) and (EOF) are given to be isosceles, it provides symmetry that will help in our deductions. 3. By the property of the angle bisector, point (E) divides side (AB) in the ratio of the lengths of the other two sides of triangle (ABC), which are equal because (ABCD) is a rectangle. Hence, (BE = BC). 4. Suppose (BE = BC) and note that since (E) is on (AB), (BA > BE = BC). Consequently, (OE < OA = OB), indicating that the symmetry axis of triangle (EOB) does not pass through (O), but through (E) or (B). 5. Considering if the symmetry passes through (E): - In this case, (EO = EB = 2 times OG) where (G) is the midpoint of (AB). - As (EOBtriangle) has an exterior angle (OEA = 2 times OBA < 90^circ) since (OBA < 90^circ), point (E) would lie on (GB) segment. Therefore, (angle OEG = 30^circ), (angle EOB = 15^circ), and (angle OEF = 180^circ - 45^circ - 30^circ = 105^circ). - This configuration makes the triangle (EOF) not isosceles as it lacks two equal angles. 6. Considering if the symmetry passes through (B): - Here, let (BC = BE = BO = CO). - Therefore, (angle OCB = 60^circ) and the angle between the angle bisector and the diagonal (AC) becomes (angle ACE = 15^circ). - Then, (angle OEC = 30^circ) as it is an inscribed angle over line segment passing through circle centered at (B).

We are given that a_na_{n+1}=16^n. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get a_n(r a_n) = 16^n. This simplifies to a_n^2 r = 16^n. As the sequence is geometric, we know a_n cannot be zero; therefore, we can divide both sides by a_n^2 to get r = frac{16^n}{a_n^2}. Now, we substitute a_n = a_1r^{n-1} and get r = frac{16^n}{a_1^2r^{2n-2}}. Rewriting this, we have ra_1^2r^{2n-2} = 16^n. Since a_1 is not dependent on n and must be a constant, let's pick a specific value for n to simplify our equation. Choosing n as 1, we get ra_1^2 = 16. As a_1 is a term of the sequence, it follows that a_1^2 must be a term of the sequence squared; therefore, it must also equate to a power of 16. Since the only options for the common ratio are powers of 2, it follows that a_1^2 must equal 16^1 = 16, and thus r = frac{16}{16} = 1. However, a common ratio of 1 would not match any of the given answer choices and would lead to a constant sequence, which contradicts the definition of a geometric progression (each term being a multiple of the previous). Therefore, we reconsider the equation ra_1^2r^{2n-2} = 16^n and realize that we must find a common ratio that when substituted back into this equation would yield a consistent result regardless of the term number n. Looking again at the options, let's test them: - For r=2: ra_1^2r^{2(n-1)} = 2a_1^24^{n-1} neq 16^n for all n, - For r=4: ra_1^2r^{2(n-1)} = 4a_1^48^{n-1} = 16^n for all n, - For r=8, r=16: Similar testing will yield that these options won't satisfy the equation for all n.

The right focus of the ellipse is at F(c,0), and one of the vertices is at B(0,b). Given that angle FBO = frac{pi}{6}, we can use the tangent of this angle to relate c and b: [ tan angle FBO = frac{c}{b} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} implies b = sqrt{3}c. ] Next, we know that the semi-major axis a of the ellipse is related to b and c by the equation a = sqrt{b^2 + c^2}. Substituting b = sqrt{3}c into this equation gives: [ a = sqrt{(sqrt{3}c)^2 + c^2} = sqrt{3c^2 + c^2} = sqrt{4c^2} = 2c. ] Given that the perimeter of triangle FBO is 3 + sqrt{3}, and considering the sides of the triangle are b, c, and a, we have: [ b + c + a = sqrt{3}c + c + 2c = 3 + sqrt{3}. ] Solving this equation for c gives c = 1.

One possible winning strategy for Petya involves making the longest possible vertical move on each of his turns. Demonstrating this strategy will show that Petya can always force a win. Steps and Justification: 1. **Setting Up the Strategy:** - Let's refer to a white cell as \\"reachable\\" if it can be reached from the rook's current position through a sequence of moves on white cells. - Our goal is to show that whenever it's Petya's turn, the reachable cells form a small number of rectangular regions, each of which has more rows than columns, and the rook is positioned in one of the cells adjacent to a corner along the horizontal. 2. **Initial Setup:** - The initial position of the rook is in an edge cell, not in a corner (since there is only one corner that is black). - Petya starts by making the longest vertical move possible, moving the rook to the opposite end of its column. 3. **General Move Description:** - Each move changes some of the white cells to black. The goal is to show that these transformations leave Petya with a configuration where the reachable cells still form rectangles with more rows than columns. 4. **Analysis of Moves:** - Suppose after some move by Petya, all reachable cells form one or more rectangular regions, each (r times c) where (r > c). - When Vasya moves, he can only move horizontally within these regions. Suppose he moves the rook (v) cells horizontally, where (v leq c). 5. **Transformation After Vasya's Move:** - Vasya's move splits the current rectangle into two smaller rectangles: - One with dimensions (r times (c - v)) - Another with dimensions ((r - 1) times (v - 1)) - Both of these smaller rectangles maintain the property (r > c) because (r - 1 > v - 1) and (r > c - v). 6. **Petya’s Next Move:** - Given that after Vasya's move the reachable cells still form rectangles with more rows than columns, Petya can again find the longest vertical move within any of these rectangles, ensuring he can continue to restrict the number of white cells effectively. 7. **Endgame:** - Since each move turns some white cells into black cells, the number of white cells will eventually diminish. - By following the strategy of making the longest possible vertical moves and always ensuring the next configuration maintains the (r > c) property, Petya ensures that Vasya will eventually be forced into a position where no moves are possible.

Each of the brunettes correctly listed all the blondes, while each blonde could list anyone except herself. Prove that based on this data, it is possible to identify at least 13 blondes.","completion":"1. **Examining the initial conditions:** - The factory has a total of 217 women. - Among them, 17 are brunettes, and the remaining 200 are blondes. - Each woman writes a list of 200 names of women who she believes are blondes. 2. **Key Observations:** - Each brunette correctly lists all 200 blondes without mistake. - Each blonde can list 200 names of her choosing, but she does not include herself in her list. Therefore, each blonde's list can have any combination of other blondes or brunettes. 3. **Total Lists:** - Each woman produces one list, leading to a total of 217 lists. 4. **Identifying the accurate blonde lists:** - The accurate list of all 200 blondes will be present only with the brunettes (17 brunettes). This accurate list will not be compiled by any blonde since a blonde cannot include herself in the list, thereby never producing a complete list of 200 blondes. 5. **Counting non-accurate blonde lists:** - We are concerned with lists that are not accurate (if a list is accurate, it is clear it comes from brunettes). Therefore, each accurate list will appear exactly 17 times (once for each brunette). 6. **Removal of accurate lists:** - Removing all the accurate lists, we are left with: [ text{Total lists} - text{Accurate lists} = 217 - 17 = 200 text{ lists} ] 7. **Distribution of non-accurate blonde lists:** - Each remaining list (200 lists) could potentially be inaccurate (i.e., created by blondes). It means these inaccurate lists could be from any of the 200 blondes or could still inaccurately list blondes. 8. **Upper limit on accurate lists:** - If a list occurs more than 17 times, it can immediately be regarded as inaccurate (produced by blondes). We now have: [ 217 - 17n quad text{where } n text{ is number of accurate lists} ] 9. **Finding the minimum value of remaining lists:** - To ensure we identify a minimum number of blondes accurately, we need to ensure the number of remaining list counts could go to 0 indicating more inaccurate lists than expected, we solve: [ 217 - 17n geq 0 ] - Hence, [ n leq 12 ] 10. **Conclusion:** - Maximum total lists that could be discarded due to being from brunettes: [ 217 - 12 times 17 = 217 - 204 = 13 ] - Therefore, at least 13 lists would definitely be blonde lists. Thus, we conclude that we can identify at least 13 blondes based on the given criteria.

What is the perimeter of the rectangle?","completion":"Let's denote the length of the rectangle as L meters and the breadth as B meters. According to the problem, the difference between the length and breadth is 23 meters, so we can write: L - B = 23 (1) The area of the rectangle is given as 3650 m², and the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the breadth: Area = L * B 3650 = L * B (2) The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding twice the length and twice the breadth: Perimeter = 2L + 2B We need to find the values of L and B to calculate the perimeter. We can use equations (1) and (2) to solve for L and B. From equation (1), we can express L in terms of B: L = B + 23 (3) Now, we substitute L from equation (3) into equation (2): 3650 = (B + 23) * B 3650 = B² + 23B This is a quadratic equation in terms of B. We can solve for B by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Let's try to factor it: B² + 23B - 3650 = 0 We need to find two numbers that multiply to -3650 and add up to 23. These numbers are 50 and -73 (because 50 * -73 = -3650 and 50 - 73 = -23). So we can factor the equation as: (B + 50)(B - 73) = 0 This gives us two possible values for B: B = -50 or B = 73 Since a breadth cannot be negative, we discard B = -50 and take B = 73 meters. Now we can find L using equation (3): L = B + 23 L = 73 + 23 L = 96 meters Now that we have both L and B, we can find the perimeter: Perimeter = 2L + 2B Perimeter = 2(96) + 2(73) Perimeter = 192 + 146 Perimeter = 338 meters Therefore, the perimeter of the rectangle is boxed{338} meters."},{"prompt":"Let (p,) (q,) (r,) and (s) be positive integers such that [ begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 0 & 3 end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} p & q r & s end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} p & q r & s end{pmatrix} begin{pmatrix} 24 & 16 27 & 18 end{pmatrix}. ] Find the smallest possible value of (p + q + r + s.)","completion":"First, perform the matrix multiplication on both sides: [ begin{pmatrix} 4p & 4q 3r & 3s end{pmatrix} = begin{pmatrix} 24p - 27q & 16p - 18q 24r - 27s & 16r - 18s end{pmatrix}. ] We derive the system of equations: 1.

Prove that in 35 moves, it is possible to achieve a state where the sum of every pair of numbers that share an edge is composite.","completion":"1. **Divide the Table**: - Consider the (10 times 10) table which contains the numbers from 1 to 100, each number appearing exactly once. - Draw a vertical line (l) to divide the table into two equal halves, a left half and a right half, each consisting of 50 cells. 2. **Distribution of Parity**: - In each half, either there are at most 25 even numbers or at most 25 odd numbers, since there are 50 cells in each half. 3. **Switching and Arranging**: - By swapping pairs of numbers of different parities between the two halves, in no more than 25 moves, we can achieve a situation where one half contains all even numbers and the other half contains all odd numbers. - This is possible because each half initially contains a mixture of even and odd numbers not exceeding 25 each. 4. **Sum of Numbers in Adjacent Cells**: - Once the arrangement is set such that the left half has all even numbers and the right half has all odd numbers, let's evaluate the adjacent cells within these halves. - Every pair of adjacent cells in the same half sums to an even number because: - (text{Even} + text{Even} = text{Even}) - (text{Odd} + text{Odd} = text{Even}) - An even sum greater than 2 is necessarily a composite number (not prime). 5. **Cross-line Adjacency**: - The only pairs where the sums might be problematic are the ones across the dividing line (l). - Consider these numbers along (l): there are 10 pairs of numbers across the line that are adjacent, where each pair consists of one even (from the left half) and one odd number (from the right half). - The sum of an even and an odd number is always odd. 6. **Ensuring Composite Sums**: - Among the numbers 1 to 100, there are sufficient numbers that upon swapping within a half can create sums that are not prime but still remain within the requirements for the composite sums: - Since a composite number can be defined as a number having divisors other than 1 and itself, we can influence the sums to be composite. - Specifically, adjust numbers so that when pairs are considered, their sums are multiples of 3 (applying the modulo operation). 7. **Final Adjustments**: - Using at most 10 swaps, we can position numbers such that these cross-line pairs yield sums which are specifically multiples of 3. - This is feasible because there will always be enough numbers between 1 to 100 adhering to modulo constraints for divisibility, i.e., reconfiguring numbers to have differences giving sums divisible by 3. # Conclusion: Thus, the process involves at most 35 steps (25 steps to initial parity separation and 10 steps for ensuring sums across the line are multiples of 3). Hence, it is proven that in 35 moves, we can ensure all sums of adjacent cells are composite numbers.

This ensures that each pair of corresponding vertices in the two bases (top to bottom) will have the same color and there will be an equal number of each color (red, blue, green) in both bases, intuitively guaranteeing that each vertex connects to vertices of all three colors. **Conclusion**: Given that n is divisible by 3, such a coloring is possible. b) Proving that if coloring is possible, n must be divisible by 3: 1. **Initial Consideration**: - Assume a proper 3-coloring of the vertices is possible such that each vertex is connected by edges to vertices of all three colors. 2. **Count the Edges Meeting the Condition**: - Let’s choose color pairs and count the edges for one such pair. Suppose we take the pair red and blue. Let r be the number of edges between a red vertex and a blue vertex. - Given the coloring condition, each red vertex must connect to exactly one blue vertex and vice versa. Therefore, the number of red vertices r_{red} equals the number of blue vertices r_{blue}. 3. **Equitable Distribution of Colors**: - Similarly, for red and green pairs, and blue and green pairs, the number of red vertices equals the number of green vertices, and the number of blue vertices equals the number of green vertices. - Thus, the number of vertices of each color needs to be the same: r_{red} = r_{blue} = r_{green}. 4. **Determine Total Number of Vertices**: - The total number of vertices is 2n (since the prism bases have n vertices each, contributing to 2n vertices in total). - Given that these vertices are equally divided among three colors, 2n must be divisible by 3, leading to the conclusion that n must also be divisible by 3. **Conclusion**: If such a 3-coloring is indeed possible, then ( n ) must be divisible by 3.

Thus, the airplane's flight path follows a great circle passing through Oslo. 2. **Determining Oslo's Coordinates:** - Oslo is located at a latitude of approximately 59^circ 55' N and a longitude of 10^circ 43' E. 3. **Path of the Airplane:** - Since the airplane heads directly west upon departure, the trajectory intersects the meridian passing through Oslo at a right angle (90 degrees). 4. **Calculating the Geographical Coordinates Upon Landing:** - Given the spherical Earth and the geometry involved, let: - S be the center of the Earth. - O be the point representing Oslo on the Earth's surface. - Q be the point where the airplane's path intersects the equator. - G be the intersection of the great circle with the equator. - O' be another point on the equator. 5. **Establishing the Great Circle Intersection:** - The great circle path that crosses the equator must pass through Oslo's meridian. - This means the great circle passes through the points defined by Oslo's coordinates, intersecting the equator at some point Q. - The angle between the line segment OS and the equatorial plane made by the great circle path OQ through Oslo is the complement of Oslo’s latitude. 6. **Defining the Key Angles:** - Let angle GSO' = 10^circ 43' (Oslo's longitude). - Then, the complementary angle is: [ angle GSQ = 90^circ - angle GSO' = 90^circ - 10^circ 43' = 79^circ 17' ] 7. **Determining the Final Position:** - The point where the airplane lands Q lies on the equator at 79^circ 17' west longitude. - This final position falls in the Pichincha province of Ecuador, approximately 120 km west of Quito. 8. **Calculating Flight Distance:** - Since OQ represents frac{1}{4} of the great circle (since it spans from a northern latitude to the equator), the distance around the Earth's circumference is approximately one-fourth of the total. - The Earth's circumference is approximately 40,000 km. - Therefore, the approximate distance of the flight is: [ frac{1}{4} times 40,000 , text{km} = 10,000 , text{km} ] # Conclusion: - The airplane's flight path is approximately 10,000 km long. - Observers waiting for the airplane in Ecuador should look along the horizon facing 59^circ 55' west of the east direction due to Oslo's latitude.

Therefore, these circles do not have a second intersection point other than (P). 3. **General Case Analysis:** - **Angle ( gamma < 90^circ )**: - Both ( angle AA'P ) and ( angle BB'P ) are less than (90^circ), so the centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) of circles ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) lie on the same side of line ( AB ) as point ( C ). - Point ( M ) must lie on the same side of ( AB ) as ( C ) since ( O_1O_2 ) is the perpendicular bisector of segment ( PM ). - Therefore, ( angle AMP = angle AA'P ) and ( angle PMB = angle BB'P ), meaning they are inscribed angles subtended by the same arc. - Given these equalities, the measure of ( angle AMB ) is ( 2gamma ). Thus, ( M ) lies on the circle where every point sees ( AB ) at an angle of ( 2gamma ) on the same side as ( C ). - **Angle ( gamma > 90^circ )**: - Here, point ( M ) lies on the opposite side of ( AB ) from ( C ). - In the cyclic quadrilaterals ( AAPM ) and ( BBPM ), ( angle AMP = 180^circ - gamma ) and ( angle BMP = 180^circ - gamma ). - Thus ( angle AMB = 360^circ - 2gamma ), implying ( M ) lies on the circle where every point sees ( AB ) at an angle of ( 360^circ - 2gamma ) on the opposite side from ( C ). 4. **Locus of ( M )**: - In both cases, ( M ) belongs to the circular arc such that every point on the arc sees the segment ( AB ) at angle ( 2gamma ) if ( gamma < 90^circ ) or at angle ( 360^circ - 2gamma ) if ( gamma > 90^circ ). 5. **Conclusion**: - The locus of the second intersection point ( M ) of the circumcircles of triangles (AAP) and (BBP) is the arc on a circle where every point lies at angle (2gamma) or (360^circ - 2gamma) viewing segment (AB), depending on whether (gamma) is less than or greater than (90^circ) respectively, appropriate to the side of (AB) relative to (C).

We can accomplish this as follows: 1. **Defining Permutations**: We list out 1006 permutations each of which has the form: [ begin{array}{ccccccc|ccccc} 1 & 2 & 3 & cdots & 1004 & 1005 & 1006 & 1007 & 1008 & cdots & 2009 & 2010 2 & 3 & 4 & cdots & 1005 & 1006 & 1 & 1007 & 1008 & cdots & 2009 & 2010 3 & 4 & 5 & cdots & 1006 & 1 & 2 & 1007 & 1008 & cdots & 2009 & 2010 vdots & vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots & vdots & vdots & vdots & vdots & cdots & vdots & vdots 1004 & 1005 & 1006 & cdots & 1001 & 1002 & 1003 & 1007 & 1008 & cdots & 2009 & 2010 1005 & 1006 & 1 & cdots & 1002 & 1003 & 1004 & 1007 & 1008 & cdots & 2009 & 2010 1006 & 1 & 2 & cdots & 1003 & 1004 & 1005 & 1007 & 1008 & cdots & 2009 & 2010 end{array} ] 2. **Structure of Permutations**: Notice the structure of these permutations. Each permutation shifts the first seven positions cyclically (i.e., shifts right and resets from the start when it reaches the end). The remaining positions ( {1007, 1008, cdots, 2010} ) are left unchanged for simplicity. 3. **Ensuring Intersection**: To ensure these 1006 permutations intersect with any arbitrary permutation of the set ( { 1, 2, ldots, 2010 } ): - Consider any arbitrary permutation of ( { 1, 2, ldots, 2010 } ). By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of the first 1006 elements of this permutation must be a number in the set ( { 1, 2, ldots, 1006 } ). - Given the cyclic structure of the first 1006 elements in our permutations, for any arrangement of these 1006 elements in the first 1006 positions, it will match the position of the corresponding element from among these cyclic permutations. 4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, any arbitrary permutation of ( { 1, 2, ldots, 2010 } ) is guaranteed to intersect with at least one of our constructed 1006 permutations at one of the first 1006 positions. Hence, the permutations as described indeed ensure the required intersection property. Remark: Using Hall's marriage lemma, one can show that this result fails if the number 1006 is replaced by 1005. This implies that 1006 is the minimal number ensuring this property.

Therefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on an 8 times 8 chessboard such that no two bishops threaten each other and each bishop is threatened by at most one bishop is 16.

The centroid (or barycenter) of a triangle with vertices at [ A_1(x_1, y_1), A_2(x_2, y_2), A_3(x_3, y_3) ] is given by the coordinates: [ x_s = frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3} quad text{and} quad y_s = frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3}. ] 2. **Condition for Centroid Being a Grid Point:** A triangle's centroid is an integer coordinate point (grid point) if and only if both ( x_s ) and ( y_s ) are integers.

Therefore, the total number of balloons Brooke has is calculated as follows: [ 12 + 8 = 20 ] So, Brooke has a total of 20 balloons. 2. **Calculate the new total of balloons for Tracy before popping any**: Tracy starts with 6 balloons and adds 24 more.

First, consider ( |f(0) - 1| < 1 ). Since ( f(0) = b ), this inequality translates to: [ |b - 1| < 1 ] This can be written as two simple inequalities: [ -1 < b - 1 < 1 ] Adding 1 to all parts gives: [ 0 < b < 2 ] 3. Next, consider ( |f(1) - 3| < 1 ).

The final step shows that the values don't overlap correctly to satisfy all inequalities. Hence, the inequalities ( 2 < a + b < 4 ) and ( 8 < 2a + b < 10 ) are inconsistent and contradictory.

This proves property 1 for n geq 2. **Step 3: Show a_n has a prime factor of the form 4k+1** **When n is odd and n geq 5:** Consider the case of determinant: [ begin{vmatrix} a_{n} & a_{n-1} a_{n-1} & a_{n-2} end{vmatrix} ] Rewriting using sequence relation: [ begin{vmatrix} a_{n} - 2a_{n-1} & a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2} a_{n-1} & a_{n-2} end{vmatrix} = begin{vmatrix} a_{n-2} & a_{n-3} a_{n-1} & a_{n-2} end{vmatrix} ] [ = -begin{vmatrix} a_{n-1} & a_{n-2} a_{n-2} & a_{n-3} end{vmatrix} = (-1)^2 begin{vmatrix} a_{n-2} & a_{n-3} a_{n-3} & a_{n-4} end{vmatrix} ] [ =(-1)^{n-3} begin{vmatrix} a_{3} & a_{2} a_{2} & a_{1} end{vmatrix} = (-1)^{n-1} ] This gives: [ a_{n}a_{n-2} = a_{n-1}^{2} + (-1)^{n-1} ] If n is odd, let a_{n-1} = t. Since n is odd and a_{n} has a prime factor p: [ p mid t^2 + 1 implies t^2 equiv -1 (text{mod} p) ] According to Fermat's Little Theorem: [ 1 equiv t^{2frac{p-1}{2}} equiv (-1)^{frac{p-1}{2}} (text{mod} p) ] Since t^2 equiv -1 (text{mod} p): [ (-1)^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv 1 implies frac{p-1}{2} text{ is even} implies p equiv 1 (text{mod} 4) ] Thus, property 2 is proved. **Step 4: For n geq 5, let n=2^alpha m where m is odd** By property 1, a_{m} mid a_{n} and from odd cases: [ a_{1} equiv a_{3} equiv cdots equiv a_{m} equiv 1 (text{mod} 2) ] For m geq 3, a_{m} geq 3 has a prime factor p such that: [ p equiv 1 (text{mod} 4) ] When m=1, since n geq 5: [ n=8 times 2^{alpha-3} (alpha geq 3) ] From property 1, a_{8} mid a_{n} and since a_{8} = 24 times 17, a_n has a prime factor 17 equiv 1 (text{mod} 4). **Conclusion:** Thus, for any integer n geq 5, a_n must have a prime factor p such that p equiv 1 (text{mod} 4).

When the train crosses a signal pole, it only has to cover its own length, because the signal pole is effectively a point with no length. The time it takes to cross the signal pole is 18 seconds. Speed = Distance / Time The distance in this case is the length of the train, which is 150 meters. Speed of the train = 150 meters / 18 seconds = 8.33 meters per second (recurring) Now, when the train crosses the platform, it has to cover the length of itself plus the length of the platform. Let's denote the length of the platform as P. The total distance the train covers when crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform: 150 meters + P. The time it takes to cross the platform is given as 39 seconds. Using the speed we found earlier (8.33 meters per second), we can set up the following equation: Speed = (Length of train + Length of platform) / Time to cross platform 8.33 meters/second = (150 meters + P) / 39 seconds Now we solve for P: 8.33 meters/second * 39 seconds = 150 meters + P 324.87 meters = 150 meters + P Subtract 150 meters from both sides to find P: 324.87 meters - 150 meters = P P = 174.87 meters Therefore, the length of the platform is approximately boxed{174.87} meters."},{"prompt":"Given the equation about x, 5^{x}= frac {a+3}{5a}, it has a negative root.
