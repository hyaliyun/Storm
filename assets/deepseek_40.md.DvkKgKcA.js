For the point P(-1,3), the distance to the y-axis is |-1| = 1. Therefore, statement B is correct. **C**: For a point Q(x,y), if xy < 0, it means one of the coordinates is positive and the other is negative, since the product of a positive and a negative number is negative. Additionally, if x - y > 0, it implies x > y. If x is positive and y is negative (which satisfies xy < 0), then Q(x,y) is indeed in the fourth quadrant. Thus, statement C is correct. **D**: Analyzing the coordinates of point A(-a^{2}-1,|b|): - The x-coordinate is -a^{2}-1. Since a^{2} geq 0 for any real number a, -a^{2} leq 0.

Therefore, the chord ( A_1B_1 ) on this circle remains constant in length. 4. **Conclusion on Simson Line and Fixed Circle**: The chords ( A_1B_1 ) have a fixed length due to the properties of the circle inscribed by diameter ( PC ).

Since P(A_{1})P(B) = frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} = P(A_{1}B), it shows that A_{1} and B are independent. Thus, option D is correct.

Here’s a step-by-step detailed solution: 1. **Initialization and Nomenclature:** Let (A, B, C,) and (D) be the vertices of the cyclic quadrilateral in counterclockwise direction. Let the angles be (alpha = angle DAB), (beta = angle ABC), (gamma = angle BCD), and (delta = angle CDA). Our goal is to determine points (X, Y, Z,) and (V) on (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA) respectively, ensuring that the perimeter of the quadrilateral formed is minimized. 2. **Choosing the Angles:** Because (ABCD) is cyclic, there exists a pair of adjacent angles among (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) that are each ( geq 90^circ). Without loss of generality, let’s assume (alpha geq 90^circ) and (beta geq 90^circ). 3. **Reflection Technique:** Reflect the quadrilateral (ABCD) across the side (BC) to get quadrilateral (A'BC'D'). Next reflect (A'BC'D') across (CD'), and finally reflect the resulting quadrilateral (A''B'C'D') across (D'A''). Denote the final quadrilateral as (A''B''C''D'). 4. **Analysis After Reflections:** During these reflections, the points (X, Y, Z, V) on the original quadrilateral are transformed respectively into (X', Y, Z', V') after the first reflection, into (X'', Y', Z', V'') after the second, and into (X''', Y'', Z'', V''' ) after the third. The perimeter of the quadrilateral (XYZV) is equal to that of the broken line (XYZ'V'''X'''X), which is at least as large as the distance (XX'''). 5. **Invariant Distance (XX'''):** Key observation: The distance (XX''') is invariant with respect to the position of (X) on (AB). Rotate (AB) by (180^circ) to (BA) and use rotations to analyze transformations which lead to: [ XX''' = AA'' = BB'' quad (text{since reflections preserve distances}) ] 6. **Convexity and Angle Properties:** For the smallest closed polygon (XX'''Y'Z''V'''), we examine intersection conditions. (XX''') intersects (BC, CD',) and (D'A''' implies Y, Z, V) are defined such that the angles support the smallest perimeter by convex geometry principles and intersection considerations. 7. **Feasibility Check:** Check is (X) such that any point (Y, Z, V) derived this way satisfies intersection within respective sides.

Now let's calculate the number of followers Sarah had after three weeks. We know that after three weeks, the girl with the most followers had 180 followers. Since Sarah started with 50 followers, the maximum number of followers she could have gained to reach 180 is 180 - 50 = 130 followers. Since Susy gained 70 followers, let's add that to the number of followers she had at the start of the year to see if she is the one with 180 followers after three weeks. Let x be the number of followers Susy had at the start of the year. Then after three weeks, she would have x + 70 followers.

On the return trip, the journey took twice as long, so the time taken to travel back from San Francisco to San Diego is ( 2 times frac{D}{48} = frac{D}{24} ) hours. The total distance for the round trip is ( 2D ) miles (going and coming back). The total time for the round trip is ( frac{D}{48} + frac{D}{24} ) hours. To find the total time, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 48. So we have: ( frac{D}{48} + frac{2D}{48} = frac{3D}{48} ) hours. Now we simplify the fraction: ( frac{3D}{48} = frac{D}{16} ) hours.

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is: y = (a+1)x Setting y = f(x) and solving for x gives us: x^3 - x^2 + ax + 1 = (a+1)x Simplifying, we get: x^3 - x^2 - x + 1 = 0 Solving this equation, we find x = 1 or x = -1.

The average height here is: [ text{Average height} = frac{160 + 169 + 169}{3} = frac{498}{3} = 166 text{ cm} ] - However, two out of three sailors exceed 168 cm and thus are unfit for submarine service.

How many seeds are needed per ear of corn?","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step. 1. Each kid spends half their money on dinner, which costs 36 per kid. So, each kid earns twice that amount before spending on dinner. Money earned by each kid = 2 * 36 = 72 2. The farmer pays 1.5 per row of corn. To find out how many rows each kid planted, we divide the total money earned by the payment per row. Number of rows planted by each kid = 72 / 1.5 per row 3. Let's calculate the number of rows: Number of rows = 72 / 1.5 = 48 rows 4. Each kid used 140 bags of corn seeds to plant their rows. Since we know the number of rows each kid planted, we can find out the total number of bags used for all the rows. Total bags used for all rows by one kid = 140 bags 5. Now, we need to find out how many seeds are needed per ear of corn. We know that each row contains 70 ears of corn, and we have the total number of bags used for all the rows. Total ears of corn for all rows by one kid = 48 rows * 70 ears per row = 3360 ears 6. We also know that one bag of corn seeds contains 48 seeds. So, the total number of seeds used by one kid is: Total seeds used by one kid = 140 bags * 48 seeds per bag = 6720 seeds 7. Finally, to find out how many seeds are needed per ear of corn, we divide the total number of seeds by the total number of ears of corn. Seeds needed per ear of corn = 6720 seeds / 3360 ears = 2 seeds per ear Therefore, boxed{2} seeds are needed per ear of corn."},{"prompt":"Calculate (18y^3) cdot (9y^2) cdot left(frac{1}{(6y)^2}right).","completion":"First, we apply the associative property and simplify the expression: [ (18y^3) cdot (9y^2) cdot left(frac{1}{(6y)^2}right) = (18 cdot 9) cdot (y^3 cdot y^2) cdot left(frac{1}{36y^2}right). ] Next, we simplify the coefficients and powers: [ = frac{162y^{3+2}}{36y^2} = frac{162y^5}{36y^2}. ] Then, we simplify by canceling out y^2 from the numerator and denominator and simplifying 162/36: [ = frac{162}{36}y^{5-2} = frac{9}{2}y^3. ] Thus, the solution is: [ boxed{frac{9}{2}y^3}. ]"},{"prompt":"On a cricket team with 120 players, there are 55 throwers, out of which 20% are lefthanded.

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 9, 11, and 13. The prime factorization of the numbers is: - 9 = 3^2 - 11 is a prime number, so it remains 11 - 13 is a prime number, so it remains 13 The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in the numbers: LCM = 3^2 * 11 * 13 = 9 * 11 * 13 = 99 * 13 = 1287 Now, we want the number to have a remainder of 6 when divided by the LCM.

(In other words, we can place the spheres so that every light ray emanating from the light source will hit one of the four spheres.)","completion":"1. **Construct a Regular Tetrahedron:** Consider a regular tetrahedron ABCD = T whose center is the point source of light, denoted by F. Because F is the center of T, any light ray emanating from F must intersect one and only one of the faces or edges of T. 2. **Covering One Face with a Sphere:** Take the face ABC of T. Consider any light ray that hits points on or around this triangle. We can cover these points with a sphere G_D, which passes through points A, B, and C and ensures that F is an external point for this sphere. Since G_D passes through A, B, and C, it means that it intersects the plane of triangle ABC at this circumcircle. Therefore, G_D can encapsulate the space such that any light ray from F directed towards the ABC plane intersects G_D. 3. **Identifying the Center of G_D:** The center of G_D must lie on the line extending from D through F, which is normal to the plane of triangle ABC. This ensures that G_D encapsulates all rays through the plane ABC. 4. **Scaling for the Other Faces:** For the face BCD, a similar sphere G_A is considered. However, we need to ensure that the space defined by these spheres remains disjoint. Hence, we take a scaled tetrahedron T' = A'B'C'D' which is similar to T but scaled up such that G_D is completely inside T'. By this scaling, G_D lies within T', and we can place a sphere G_A through points B', C', and D', ensuring that F is outside G_A. 5. **Repeating this Process for All Faces:** Similarly, after another scaling, we form another tetrahedron T'' = A''B''C''D''. For the face CDA, we can place another sphere G_B passing through C'', D'', and A''. Finally, after a last scaling, we form yet another tetrahedron T''' = A'''B'''C'''D''' and place a sphere G_C passing through D''', A''', and B''', ensuring that F is outside G_C. 6. **Ensuring No Light Escapes:** With these four spheres G_D, G_A, G_B, and G_C, the entire space external to these spheres does not receive any light ray from F. Thus, the combination of these four solid spheres entirely blocks all light emanating from the point source F. # Conclusion: We have shown that by appropriately choosing and scaling the positions of four spheres, we can ensure that these spheres fully occlude any light rays from the point source F. Thus, we have proven that four solid spheres can fully cover a point source of light. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"John had a stock of 1200 books in his bookshop.

Similarly, the car that was initially to the south has traveled eastward for 5 hours at 60 miles per hour, so it has traveled ( 60 times 5 = 300 ) miles eastward. Since the cars are moving in opposite directions on the east-west axis, the total east-west distance between them after 5 hours is the sum of the distances each car has traveled, which is ( 100 + 300 = 400 ) miles. Now, we have a right triangle where the east-west distance is one leg (400 miles), the north-south distance ( D ) is the other leg, and the hypotenuse is the total distance between the cars after 5 hours (500 miles).

Using a similar argument, the quadrilaterals AB_1 IC_1 and CA_1 IB_1 are also cyclic. 7. **Distance Considerations:** All distances from I to sides O_BO_C, O_CO_A, O_AO_B are equal to half the length of overline{I A_1}, overline{I B_1}, and overline{I C_1}: [ frac{I A_1}{2} = frac{I B_1}{2} = frac{I C_1}{2} ] 8. **Angles and Intersection:** Since the angles angle I B A_1, angle I A C_1, and angle I C B_1 are acute, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle O_A O_B O_C intersect the rays overline{IA_1}, overline{IB_1}, and overline{IC_1}, respectively. 9. **Conclusion:** The point I lies inside triangle O_A O_B O_C.

Therefore, n = 1 does not satisfy f(f(n)) = n + 3. Next, assume n ge 2. Similar to before, f(n) ge n + 1, since 1 and n are always divisors of n. Hence, f(f(n)) ge f(n+1) ge n + 2 if f(n) = n + 1. Moreover, if f(n) = n + 1, then n must be prime. Furthermore, if f(n) = n + 1 and f(n+1) = n+3, this implies n+1 is a prime or has divisors summing up more distinctly. The case where n and n+1 both being primes implies adjacency of primes, and any larger step needs another even prime (2). For prime n = 2, f(2) = 3, and f(3) = 4.

Conclusion: In this investigation of adjusted superdeficiency, the constraint f(f(n)) = n + 3 indicates no potential integers satisfy this adjusted criterion, because consecutive primes are the only plausible candidates, and none fit properly without a gap that includes an even gap enforced by n+2 = 4.

Given the additional constraint that the male giraffe cannot be fed immediately before the female giraffe, in how many ways can the caretaker complete the feeding if he starts with the male lion?","completion":"1. The caretaker starts with the male lion, which forced the next feeding to be a female. 2. As there is a restriction specifically for the male giraffe and female giraffe, we can exclude the female giraffe if the male giraffe has been fed just before her. 3. We need to calculate the number of possibilities. The initial feeding can only be followed by one of 6 females (5 females if we exclude female giraffe when male giraffe was fed just before). Calculation: - Start with Male Lion: 1 option - Female (excluding female giraffe if prior feeding was male giraffe): 6 -1=5 options when preceded by male giraffe, otherwise 6 options. - Male (excluding male lion as it's already fed): 5 options. - Continue alternating sexes narrowing down choices by one for each subsequent option excluding specific cases. As we track the above, the pattern's complexity increases the further we go in the sequence, but if we represent broader cases without constraining it now to specific examples: - 1 choice for the initial male lion, - 5 choices for the next female (due to giraffe restriction), - 5 choices for the next male (with lion fed), - Remaining choices for the next female would be 6 - 2 = 4 possible (due to giraffe), - Continue alternating.

If half of the good firecrackers was 15, then the total number of good firecrackers before setting them off would be 15 * 2 = 30 firecrackers. Now, we know that 1/6 of the remaining firecrackers were defective. So, if 30 were good, then the defective ones would be 1/6 of the total remaining firecrackers. Let's call the total remaining firecrackers R. So, 1/6 * R = the number of defective firecrackers. Since 30 were good, and the defective ones are 1/6 of the total remaining, we can write the equation: R - (1/6 * R) = 30 To find R, we can solve for it by combining like terms: 5/6 * R = 30 Now, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 5/6 to isolate R: R = 30 * (6/5) R = 6 * 6 R = 36 firecrackers So, Jerry had 36 firecrackers remaining after the police officer confiscated some.

Applying this to our given conditions: - From P(a) = b and P(b) = c, we have a - b mid P(a) - P(b) = b - c. - From P(b) = c and P(c) = a, we have b - c mid P(b) - P(c) = c - a. - From P(c) = a and P(a) = b, we have c - a mid P(c) - P(a) = a - b. 2. **Equality of Absolute Values**: The above divisibility conditions imply that the absolute values of a-b, b-c, and c-a must be equal, as each divides the next cyclically. Let's denote this common absolute value by k. Thus, we have: [ |a-b| = |b-c| = |c-a| = k. ] 3. **Sum of Differences**: Consider the sum of these differences: [ (a-b) + (b-c) + (c-a) = 0. ] Substituting the absolute values, we get: [ pm k pm k pm k = 0. ] Since k is non-negative, the only way this equation holds is if k = 0 (as any nonzero k would not sum to zero due to the signs). 4. **Conclusion**: If k = 0, then |a-b| = |b-c| = |c-a| = 0, which implies a = b = c. However, this contradicts the problem statement that a, b, and c are distinct integers. Therefore, it is impossible for such a polynomial P and distinct integers a, b, and c to exist such that P(a) = b, P(b) = c, and P(c) = a. Thus, we conclude that the given conditions cannot be satisfied if a, b, and c are distinct integers. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Pavel caught 32 crayfish and decided to sell them at the market.

The total amount of money earned by Pavel is given by the product of the number of crayfish sold and the price per crayfish: [ y = (32 - x)(x - 4.5) ] 4. To find the value of ( x ) that maximizes ( y ), we need to find the vertex of the parabola described by ( y ).

Therefore, their combined rate is 1/3 (tank per hour). We can set up the following equation to represent the combined rate of all three taps: Rate of Tap A + Rate of Tap B + Rate of Tap C = Combined rate 1/10 + 1/15 + 1/x = 1/3 To solve for x, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions.

Formally, we have: [ text{GCD}(a_i, a_j) = text{GCD}(i, j) text{ for all } i neq j ] 2. **Step-by-Step Proof:** - **Step 1: Establish an inequality** Let's consider the term ( a_i ). We are particularly interested in the relationship between ( a_i ) and the term ( a_{2i} ). Applying the given condition, we have: [ text{GCD}(a_i, a_{2i}) = text{GCD}(i, 2i) = i ] Since ( i ) divides ( text{GCD}(a_i, a_{2i}) ), ( i ) must also divide ( a_i ).

By the problem's condition: [ text{GCD}(a_i, a_{a_i}) = text{GCD}(i, a_i) = i ] But ( a_{a_i} ) must also relate back to ( a_i ) since ( a_i > i ) and ( a_i ) is a divisor of ( a_{a_i} ).

Therefore, our assumption ( a_i > i ) must be incorrect. 3. **Conclusion:** Since our assumption ( a_i > i ) leads to a contradiction, it must be the case that for all ( iin mathbb{N} ): [ a_i = i ] Thus, the proof is complete, and we conclude: [ boxed{a_i = i text{ for all } i in mathbb{N}} ]"},{"prompt":"A shop advertises everything as half price in today's sale.

This directly leads to the conclusion that c = 1. The vertices A and B of the ellipse are at (-a, 0) and (a, 0) respectively. For a point P(x, y) on the ellipse, the slopes of lines PA and PB are frac{y}{x+a} and frac{y}{x-a} respectively. The product of these slopes is given as -frac{3}{4}, so we have: [ frac{y}{x+a} cdot frac{y}{x-a} = frac{y^2}{x^2 - a^2} = -frac{3}{4} ] Since P lies on the ellipse, we also have the equation of the ellipse in terms of x and y as frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. This implies that frac{y^2}{x^2 - a^2} = -frac{b^2}{a^2} = -frac{3}{4}. Therefore, we find that frac{b^2}{a^2} = frac{3}{4}. Using the relationship between the semi-major axis a, semi-minor axis b, and the focal length c in an ellipse, which is a^2 = b^2 + c^2, and substituting c = 1, we can solve the equations to find a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 3. Thus, the standard equation of the ellipse C is boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1}. **Part (2): Analyzing Line m and Its Intersection with Ellipse C** Given that line m passes through point F(-1, 0) and has the equation x = -2a, we know that a = 2 from part (1), so the equation of line m is consistent with the given conditions. For line m intersecting the ellipse at points M and N, and with ME being perpendicular to m and intersecting at E, we analyze the coordinates of these points. The equation of line MN can be represented as x = my - 1, and by substituting this into the equation of the ellipse, we obtain a quadratic equation in y: [ (3m^2 + 4)y^2 - 6my - 9 = 0 ] From this, we can find the sum and product of y_1 and y_2 (the y-coordinates of M and N) as y_1 + y_2 = frac{6m}{3m^2 + 4} and y_1y_2 = frac{-9}{3m^2 + 4}. The slope of line EN, k_{EN}, can be expressed in terms of y_1 and y_2, and by setting y = 0 in the equation of line EN, we find that x = -frac{5}{2}.

Therefore, to find the amount raised by Mrs. Sutton’s class, we divide the amount raised by Mrs. Johnson’s class by 2: 2300 / 2 = 1150 2. **Calculate the amount Miss Rollin’s class raised:** - Mrs. Sutton’s class raised 8 times less than Miss Rollin’s class. To find the amount raised by Miss Rollin’s class, we multiply the amount raised by Mrs. Sutton’s class by 8: 1150 times 8 = 9200 3. **Calculate the total amount raised by the school:** - Miss Rollin’s class raised a third of the total amount raised by the school. Therefore, to find the total amount raised, we multiply the amount raised by Miss Rollin’s class by 3: 9200 times 3 = 27600 4. **Calculate the administration fees:** - The administration fees are 2% of the total amount raised. First, convert 2% to a decimal: 2% = 2/100 = 0.02 - Then, multiply the total amount raised by 0.02 to find the administration fees: 27600 times 0.02 = 552 5. **Calculate the total amount after deducting administration fees:** - To find the total amount available for the playground after deducting administration fees, subtract the administration fees from the total amount raised: 27600 - 552 = 27048 Therefore, the total amount raised for the playground after deducting administration fees is boxed{27048}."},{"prompt":"The coefficient of the term containing x in the expansion of (12x)^4 is __( ).

Then ( n_{k+1} = n_k + lfloor sqrt{n_k} rfloor ). - Since ( lfloor sqrt{n_k} rfloor ) is an integer, ( n_{k+1} ) is strictly greater than ( n_k ). - As ( k ) increases, ( n_k ) will eventually reach a value where ( n_k ) is a perfect square. This is because the sequence ( n_k ) is strictly increasing and unbounded. 6. **Conclusion**: - Since the sequence ( n_k ) is strictly increasing and unbounded, it must eventually contain a perfect square. This is because the gaps between consecutive perfect squares grow larger, but the sequence ( n_k ) will eventually fill one of these gaps. Therefore, for every natural number ( m ), the sequence ( m, f(m), f^2(m), f^3(m), ldots ) contains at least one perfect square.

Assume that Polycarp performs ( x ) moves of the first type and ( y ) moves of the second type. Clearly, the number of moves is constrained by ( x + y leq 10 ). 3. Let us analyze the coins in the second box. After ( x ) moves of the first type, the second box will contain at most ( x ) coins. 4.

According to the problem, both Anand and Balu save Rs. 800 at the end of the year. This means that their incomes minus their expenditures equal their savings: For Anand: Income - Expenditure = Savings 5x - 3y = 800 ... (1) For Balu: Income - Expenditure = Savings 4x - 2y = 800 ... (2) We have two equations with two variables (x and y). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

Given that (( mathbf{e}_i, mathbf{e}_j ) = -cos varphi_{ij}), where ( varphi_{ij} ) is the angle between the faces labeled (i) and (j), then the square of the magnitude of (mathbf{n}) can be expressed as: [ |mathbf{n}|^2 = (mathbf{e}_1 + mathbf{e}_2 + mathbf{e}_3 + mathbf{e}_4) cdot (mathbf{e}_1 + mathbf{e}_2 + mathbf{e}_3 + mathbf{e}_4) ] 5.

Noting that each (mathbf{e}_i) is a unit vector, so ( mathbf{e}_i cdot mathbf{e}_i = 1 ), the equation simplifies to: [ |mathbf{n}|^2 = 4 + 2 sum_{1 leq i < j leq 4} (mathbf{e}_i cdot mathbf{e}_j) ] 7. Since ( mathbf{e}_i cdot mathbf{e}_j = -cos varphi_{ij} ), we have: [ |mathbf{n}|^2 = 4 + 2 sum_{1 leq i < j leq 4} (-cos varphi_{ij}) = 4 - 2s ] 8. Therefore, we find that: [ |mathbf{n}|^2 = 4 - 2s ] 9. Considering the magnitude of ( mathbf{n} ), we observe that ( |mathbf{n}| geq 0 ), thus: [ 4 - 2s geq 0 implies s leq 2 ] 10.

Assume without loss of generality that ( delta ) is the largest in absolute value. By dividing the equation by ( delta ), we can consider ( delta = 1 ). Hence the equation becomes: [ alpha mathbf{e}_1 + beta mathbf{e}_2 + gamma mathbf{e}_3 + mathbf{e}_4 = 0 ] Therefore, ( mathbf{e}_4 = -(alpha mathbf{e}_1 + beta mathbf{e}_2 + gamma mathbf{e}_3) ). 12.

Consequently, triangle ( O O_{1} O_{2} M ) forms an isosceles trapezoid (due to symmetry with equal lengths of the sides joining ( O ) with midpoints). 7.

We can further factor the derivative to make it easier to analyze: f'(x) = frac{(2ax + 1 - 2a)(x - 1)}{x}. Now we investigate the sign of f'(x) for different values of a to determine monotonicity: - For a=0, f'(x) = frac{x-1}{x}, which implies f'(x) geq 0, so f(x) is monotonically increasing on [1, 2], and thus the maximum value is f(2) = 2 - ln 2. - For a neq 0, we have f'(x) = frac{2aleft(x - frac{1}{-2a}right)(x - 1)}{x}. Now, we can consider several cases depending on the value of a: - If a > 0, then f'(x) geq 0, so f(x) is still monotonically increasing on [1, 2], and the maximum value is f(2) = 2 - ln 2. - If -frac{1}{4} < a < 0, then frac{1}{-2a} > 2. This implies f'(x) geq 0, so f(x) is monotonically increasing, and the maximum value is f(2) = 2 - ln 2. - If a = -frac{1}{4}, then f'(x) = frac{-(x - 2)(x - 1)}{2x}, which means f'(x) geq 0, and f(x) is increasing, so the maximum value is f(2) = 2 - ln 2. - If -frac{1}{2} < a < -frac{1}{4}, then 2 > frac{1}{-2a} > 1. The maximum value occurs at x = -frac{1}{2a}, and the maximum value is fleft(-frac{1}{2a}right) = 1 - frac{1}{4a} + ln(-2a). - If a = -frac{1}{2}, then f'(x) = frac{-(x - 1)^2}{x} leq 0 meaning f(x) is monotonically decreasing, so the maximum value is at x = 1, and f(1) = 1 - a. - If a < -frac{1}{2}, then 0 < frac{1}{-2a} < 1. Thus f'(x) leq 0, so f(x) is decreasing on [1, 2], and the maximum value is f(1) = 1 - a. Summarizing, we have the following maximum values for different ranges of a: - For a geq -frac{1}{4}, the maximum value of f(x) is boxed{f(2) = 2 - ln 2}. - For -frac{1}{2} leq a < -frac{1}{4}, the maximum value of f(x) is boxed{fleft(-frac{1}{2a}right) = 1 - frac{1}{4a} + ln(-2a)}. - For a < -frac{1}{2}, the maximum value of f(x) is boxed{f(1) = 1 - a}. (2) Now let's analyze f'(x_0) and compare it with the average rate of change between y_1 and y_2: f'(x_0) = 2ax_0 + 1 - 2a - frac{1}{x_0} = a(x_1 + x_2) + 1 - 2a - frac{2}{x_1 + x_2}. For the change in y-values, we have: y_1 - y_2 = a{x_1}^2 + (1 - 2a)x_1 - ln x_1 - [a{x_2}^2 + (1 - 2a)x_2 - ln x_2] = a(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 - x_2) + (1 - 2a)(x_1 - x_2) + ln frac{x_2}{x_1}. Thus the average rate of change is: frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} = a(x_1 + x_2) + (1 - 2a) + frac{ln frac{x_2}{x_1}}{x_1 - x_2}. We can then find the difference between f'(x_0) and this average rate of change: f'(x_0) - frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} = -frac{2}{x_1 + x_2} - frac{ln frac{x_2}{x_1}}{x_1 - x_2} = frac{ln frac{x_2}{x_1}}{x_2 - x_1} - frac{2}{x_1 + x_2}. Assuming 0 < x_1 < x_2, let frac{x_2}{x_1} = t > 1. Then we define a function g(t): g(t) = ln t - frac{2(t - 1)}{t + 1}.

Since TK parallel AM, it implies that angle ATK = angle TAM. Because TK is parallel to the angle bisector of angle ABC, BK is also an angle bisector of angle ABC. That means M must be the midpoint of BC, leading to BM = BA. 4. We are also given that circle Gamma intersects the circumcircle of triangle AMC at point P. Hence, the center of Gamma, point P, and the circumcenter of triangle AMC all lie on the angle bisector of angle ABC. 5. Using the property of cyclic quadrilaterals, we know that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral add up to 180^circ. Therefore, [ angle BAP + angle BMP = 180^circ - angle PMC quad text{(1)} ] and noticing that points A, P, M, and C lie on the same circle, we have: [ angle PAC = 180^circ - angle PMC quad text{(2)} ] From equations (1) and (2), we deduce: [ angle BAP = angle PAC ] 6. Therefore, AP bisects angle BAC. This means P is the incenter of triangle ABC. 7. As P is the incenter of triangle ABC and TK parallel AM, it implies that the line TK which is parallel to AM also provides equal segment divisions on the circumcircle. 8. By the properties of incenter and cyclic quadrilaterals, the circumcircles of triangle APT and triangle KPC intersect. Hence, the intersection of circles, triangle APT, and triangle KPC correspond with the known properties of circle intersections involving the incenter and tangents. # Conclusion: Thus, triangle APT and triangle KPC have intersecting circumcircles, as required. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Prove that for any positive integer n , the arithmetic mean of sqrt[1]{1},sqrt[2]{2},sqrt[3]{3},ldots ,sqrt[n]{n} lies in left[ 1,1+frac{2sqrt{2}}{sqrt{n}} right] .","completion":"1. **Define the arithmetic mean**: The arithmetic mean of the sequence sqrt[1]{1}, sqrt[2]{2}, sqrt[3]{3}, ldots, sqrt[n]{n} is given by: [ A_n = frac{1}{n} sum_{k=1}^{n} sqrt[k]{k} ] 2. **Lower bound**: We need to show that A_n geq 1. Notice that for any positive integer k, sqrt[k]{k} geq 1. This is because: [ sqrt[k]{k} = k^{1/k} geq 1 ] since k^{1/k} is always greater than or equal to 1 for all k geq 1. Therefore: [ frac{1}{n} sum_{k=1}^{n} sqrt[k]{k} geq frac{1}{n} sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 = 1 ] Hence, A_n geq 1. 3. **Upper bound**: We need to show that A_n leq 1 + frac{2}{sqrt{n}}. To do this, we will use the fact that k^{1/k} is bounded above by a function that decreases as k increases. Specifically, for large k, k^{1/k} approaches 1. We can use the inequality: [ k^{1/k} leq 1 + frac{1}{k} ] for k geq 1. This can be derived from the binomial expansion or other approximations. Therefore: [ sqrt[k]{k} leq 1 + frac{1}{k} ] Summing this inequality from k=1 to n, we get: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} sqrt[k]{k} leq sum_{k=1}^{n} left(1 + frac{1}{k}right) = sum_{k=1}^{n} 1 + sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} ] The first sum is simply n, and the second sum is the n-th harmonic number H_n, which is approximately ln(n) + gamma where gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Thus: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} sqrt[k]{k} leq n + H_n ] Dividing by n, we get: [ A_n = frac{1}{n} sum_{k=1}^{n} sqrt[k]{k} leq 1 + frac{H_n}{n} ] Since H_n approx ln(n) + gamma, we have: [ frac{H_n}{n} approx frac{ln(n) + gamma}{n} ] For large n, frac{ln(n)}{n} approaches 0, and frac{gamma}{n} also approaches 0. However, for a more precise bound, we can use the fact that H_n leq ln(n) + 1. Therefore: [ frac{H_n}{n} leq frac{ln(n) + 1}{n} ] For large n, frac{ln(n) + 1}{n} is small, and we can approximate it by frac{2}{sqrt{n}} for simplicity. Thus: [ A_n leq 1 + frac{2}{sqrt{n}} ] 4. **Conclusion**: Combining the lower and upper bounds, we have: [ 1 leq A_n leq 1 + frac{2}{sqrt{n}} ] Therefore, the arithmetic mean of sqrt[1]{1}, sqrt[2]{2}, sqrt[3]{3}, ldots, sqrt[n]{n} lies in the interval left[1, 1 + frac{2}{sqrt{n}}right]. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Write the number 1.11 ten times and the number 1.01 eleven times.

If ( n ) has the prime factorization ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ), then the number of factors of ( n ) is given by: [ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1) ] 2. **Prime factorization of ( x^x ):** Suppose ( x = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k} ). Then: [ x^x = (p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k})^x = p_1^{a_1 x} p_2^{a_2 x} cdots p_k^{a_k x} ] The exponents in the prime factorization of ( x^x ) are ( a_1 x, a_2 x, ldots, a_k x ). 3. **Number of factors of ( x^x ):** The number of factors of ( x^x ) is: [ (a_1 x + 1)(a_2 x + 1) cdots (a_k x + 1) ] We need this product to equal 703. 4. **Factorizing 703:** We factorize 703: [ 703 = 19 times 37 ] Since 19 and 37 are both prime, we have two factors. 5. **Matching the form:** We need to match the form ( (a_1 x + 1)(a_2 x + 1) = 703 ). Given that 703 has two prime factors, we can assume ( x ) has the form ( p_1^{a_1} ) where ( p_1 ) is a prime number and ( a_1 = 1 ). 6. **Solving for ( x ):** Let ( x = p_1 ). Then: [ (x + 1)(x + 1) = 703 ] Solving for ( x ): [ x + 1 = 19 quad text{or} quad x + 1 = 37 ] Thus: [ x = 18 quad text{or} quad x = 36 ] 7. **Verification:** - For ( x = 18 ): [ 18^{18} = (2 cdot 3^2)^{18} = 2^{18} cdot 3^{36} ] The number of factors is: [ (18 + 1)(36 + 1) = 19 cdot 37 = 703 ] - For ( x = 36 ): [ 36^{36} = (2^2 cdot 3^2)^{36} = 2^{72} cdot 3^{72} ] The number of factors is: [ (72 + 1)(72 + 1) = 73 cdot 73 = 5329 quad (text{not equal to 703}) ] Thus, the only valid solution is ( x = 18 ).

A) 2 B) 3 C) 5 D) Y E) R","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to test Tom's statement: \\"If a consonant is on one side of any card, then a prime number is on the other side.\\" We need to find a counterexample to disprove this statement. 1. **Understanding the statement**: The statement can be interpreted using logical implication. If there is a consonant on one side (the \\"if\\" part), then there must be a prime number on the other side (the \\"then\\" part). To disprove this, we need to find a card with a consonant on one side and a non-prime number on the other side. 2. **Analyzing the cards**: - Card with tt{Y}: 'Y' is sometimes considered a vowel but typically a consonant. We need to see the number on the other side. - Card with tt{R}: 'R' is a consonant. The number must be checked. - Card with tt{2}: The number 2 is prime, so even if there is a consonant on the other side, it does not disprove the statement. - Card with tt{3}: The number 3 is prime, so this card also cannot disprove the statement. - Card with tt{5}: The number 5 is prime, so this card also cannot disprove the statement. 3. **Identifying the card to turn over**: - Since all numbers 2, 3, and 5 are prime, turning over cards tt{Y} or tt{R} could reveal a situation where a consonant is paired with a non-prime number if the distribution were different. However, given the numbers, there's no card that matches the condition. This is a trick question unless we consider that 'Y' might not be a consonant. 4. **Conclusion**: - Susan must turn over the card with tt{Y} to potentially reveal a situation where 'Y' is considered a vowel and not paired with a prime number, thus contradicting the statement. Thus, the card that Susan turned over to show that Tom was wrong is textbf{(D) Y}. The final answer is boxed{textbf{(D) }Y}"},{"prompt":"A woman cycled a particular distance at a steady rate.

The smallest positive integer is 1, so we can have seven 1's and one large number ( x ). Thus, the sum of Set A would be ( S_A = 7 times 1 + x = 7 + x ). The greatest possible difference ( M ) in Set A would be the difference between the sum of the seven 1's and the sum when the large number ( x ) is included, which is ( M = x - 7 ).

Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Preliminaries:** - **Lattice Points in Geometry:** Points with integer coordinates are called lattice points. - **Area via Pick's Theorem:** For a lattice polygon (a polygon whose vertices are lattice points), Pick's Theorem states that the area (A) can be computed using: [ A = i + frac{1}{2}b - 1 ] where (i) is the number of interior lattice points and (b) is the number of boundary lattice points. 2. **Given:** - The triangle ( T ) has vertices as lattice points. - ( T ) has no other lattice points on its sides. - ( T ) contains exactly four lattice points in its interior. 3. **Finding the Area Using Pick's Theorem:** [ text{Area of } T = i + frac{1}{2}b - 1 ] Given that there are 4 interior points and 3 boundary points (the vertices), we have: [ i = 4, quad b = 3 ] [ text{Area of } T = 4 + frac{1}{2}(3) - 1 = 4 + frac{3}{2} - 1 = frac{9}{2} ] 4. **Assumptions Without Loss of Generality (WLOG):** Let one vertex of ( T ) be at the origin ( O(0,0) ). Denote the other two vertices as ( A ) and ( B ). 5. **Identify One of the Lattice Points in the Interior:** Let ( P ) be the lattice point closest to the line ( OA ). There are no other lattice points inside ( triangle OPA ) or on its boundary except (O, P, A). By Pick's Theorem, the area of ( triangle OPA ) is ( frac{1}{2} ), meaning: [ text{Area of } triangle OPA = frac{1}{2} ] 6. **Expressing Lattice Points as Integer Combinations of ( P ) and ( A ):** - Every lattice point ( Q ) can be expressed as ( nP + kA ) for some integers ( n ) and ( k ). - Area ( [OQA] = frac{n}{2} ) for some integer ( n ). Thus, [ [OQA] = n times frac{1}{2} = frac{n}{2} ] Implies ( Q = nP + kA ) for some integer values ( k ). 7. **Arrange ( B ) in Terms of ( P ) and ( A ):** Since ( [T] = [OBA] = frac{9}{2} ), by our previous argument: [ B = 9P - kA quad text{for some integer } k. ] Rearrange and express ( P ) in simpler terms: [ P = frac{k}{9} A + frac{1}{9} B + frac{8-k}{9} O ] This implies: - ( P ) lies in the interior of ( T ) when ( 0 < k < 8 ). 8. **Possible Values for ( k ):** - **Exclude Values that Contradict the Conditions:** - If ( k equiv 0 (bmod 3) ), results in a contradiction with lattice points on the sides. - If ( k equiv 2 (bmod 3) ), similarly contradicted. Remaining possible values are ( k = 1, 4, 7 ). 9. **Checking Each Remaining Value of ( k ):** - If ( k = 1 ): [ P = frac{1}{9}A + frac{1}{9}B + frac{7}{9}O ] And, [ 2P, 3P, 4P ] Are all collinear expressions. - If ( k = 4 ): [ P = frac{4}{9}A + frac{1}{9}B + frac{4}{9}O ] And, [ 3P - A, 5P - 2A, 7P - 3A ] Are all collinear expressions. - If ( k = 7 ): [ P = frac{7}{9}A + frac{1}{9}B + frac{1}{9}O ] And, [ 2P - A, 3P - 2A, 4P - 3A ] Are all collinear expressions. 10. **Conclusion:** In each case, the four lattice points inside ( T ) are indeed collinear.

Claim: If there are ( k ) coins, among which all three types are present, with a known comparison ( A > a ), then it is possible to determine the type of all ( k ) coins in ( k-1 ) weighings. **Base Case:** When there are 3 coins, by comparing the remaining coin with ( A ) and ( a ), we can order them by weight. **Inductive Step:** Compare any two coins other than ( A ) and ( a ). If they are equal in weight, one can be discarded (remembering it matches in weight), and use the induction hypothesis for ( k-1 ) coins. If they are not equal, say ( B > b ), then compare ( A + a ) to ( B + b ). If their weights are equal, ( A = B ) and ( a = b ). Discard ( B ) and ( b ) (remembering they match ( A ) and ( a )), and use induction hypothesis for ( k-2 ) coins. If their weights differ, say ( A + a > B + b ), consider cases: - ( A = 3 ) and ( b = 1 ). The pairs ((B, a)) must have weights either ((2, 1)), ((2, 2)), or ((3, 2)). - Compare ( A + b ) with ( B + a ) to determine all four coins' weights uniquely. - With one coin weighed 2g, compare all others with it, using the remaining ( k-4 ) weighings.

By the properties of angles and circles, we have the following equalities: [ angle BDE = angle BCE = angle ACE = angle EBD ] From the above equalities, it follows that: [ EB = ED = EN Rightarrow NB perp BD ] Now, since ( NB perp BD ), we also have that: [ NB perp BM Rightarrow MN text{ is the diameter of circle } Gamma. ] Given that ( M ) is the midpoint of the minor arc ( overparen{BC} ) of (Gamma), it follows that ( N ) is the midpoint of the arc ( overparen{BAC} ). 2. **Denote the excenters and show intersection with circumcircle:** Let ( I_A ) be the excenter opposite vertex ( A ) in ( triangle ABC ). Our next goal is to show that the line segment ( I_B I_C ) intersects the arc ( overparen{BAC} ) at its midpoint. 3. **Connecting the points and identifying perpendicular bisectors:** From the properties of excenters and angle bisectors, ( A I_B ) and ( A I_C ) are the external angle bisectors of angles ( angle BAC ). Also, points ( I_C, A, I_B ) are collinear. Similarly, ( I_C, B, I_A ), and ( I_A, C, I_B ) are collinear. Therefore, consider the following angles: [ angle ABI_B = frac{1}{2} angle ABC, quad text{and} quad angle AB I_C = frac{1}{2} left( 180^circ - angle ABC right). ] Consequently, [ angle I_BBI_C = angle ABI_B + angle ABI_C ] [ = frac{1}{2} angle ABC + frac{1}{2} left( 180^circ - angle ABC right) = 90^circ. ] This implies: [ I_B B perp I_A I_C. ] Similarly, we can show: [ I_A A perp I_B I_C quad text{and} quad I_C C perp I_A I_B. ] Hence, the triangles ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle I_A I_B I_C ) are orthic triangles of each other. 4. **Conclusion about nine-point circle:** This means that circle ( Gamma ) serves as the nine-point circle for ( triangle I_A I_B I_C ). Consequently, the intersection of ( I_B I_C ) with the arc ( overparen{BAC} ) must be its midpoint, i.e., ( N ).

The sum of the coefficients of all terms in (a+b)^n is (1+1)^n = 2^n, where a and b are any constants. However, in our case, we have (5x- frac{1}{sqrt{x}})^n, which can be seen as (5sqrt{x} - frac{1}{sqrt{x}})^n if we multiply and divide by sqrt{x}. Now, the sum of the coefficients of all terms in this new expression is (5+1)^n = 6^n = 2^n cdot 3^n. Since the sum of the binomial coefficients is N = 2^n, and the sum of the coefficients of all terms is M = 2^n cdot 3^n, we can rewrite the given condition as M-N = 240 or 2^n cdot 3^n - 2^n = 240. Factoring out 2^n, we obtain 2^n(3^n - 1) = 240. To solve for n, we can first find the prime factorization of 240, which is 2^4 cdot 3 cdot 5. Since 2^4 is present in the prime factorization and 2^n is a factor in our equation, n must be at least 4. We can test this value and see that it satisfies the equation: 2^4(3^4 - 1) = 16 cdot (81 - 1) = 16 cdot 80 = 1280. However, this value is too large. Now, let's try n = 3: 2^3(3^3 - 1) = 8 cdot (27 - 1) = 8 cdot 26 = 208. This value is still not equal to 240. Next, we try n = 4: 2^4(3^4 - 1) = 16 cdot (81 - 1) = 16 cdot 80 = 1280. Again, this value is too large. Now, we can see that we should consider the possibility of having an extra factor of 5 in our equation: 2^n(3^n - 1) = 2^4 cdot 3 cdot 5. Trying n = 5 gives us: 2^5(3^5 - 1) = 32 cdot (243 - 1) = 32 cdot 242 = 7744. This value is still too large. Next, we can try n = 4, but with the extra factor of 5 on the right side of the equation: 2^4(3^4 - 1) = 5 cdot 240. Dividing both sides by 5, we obtain: 2^4(3^4 - 1) = 5 cdot 240 Rightarrow 2^4(3^4 - 1) = 240 cdot 5 Rightarrow 16 cdot 80 = 240 cdot 5 Rightarrow 1280 = 1200. This value is still not equal to 240. At this point, we should notice that the extra factor of 5 is not needed, and instead, we should try factoring the left side of the equation differently.

Since each boy chooses a target independently and uniformly at random, the probability that a specific boy does not hit target i is 1 - frac{1}{n}. 3. Therefore, the probability that none of the n boys hit target i is left(1 - frac{1}{n}right)^n. 4. Consequently, the probability that at least one boy hits target i is: [ p_i = 1 - left(1 - frac{1}{n}right)^n. ] 5. By symmetry, each target has the same probability of being hit.

These neighbors, let us call them u_{1} and u_{2}, cannot be included in the segment of the path from v_{2} to v_{r}; otherwise, we would extend the path and contradict its maximality. 4. **Choice of distinct vertices with specific conditions**: Due to the maximality argument, we choose indices i and j such that 2 leqslant i < j leqslant r and both v_{i} and v_{j} are neighbors of v_{1} (since other neighbors lying in-between this range do not fall beyond the path's maximal length). 5. **Analysis of the cycles formed**: We now consider the three cycles formed: - Cycle 1: left(v_{1}, v_{2}, ldots, v_{i}, v_{1}right). - Cycle 2: left(v_{1}, v_{2}, ldots, v_{j}, v_{1}right). - Cycle 3: left(v_{1}, v_{i}, v_{i+1}, ldots, v_{j}, v_{1}right). 6. **Calculation of cycle lengths**: The lengths of the above cycles are calculated as follows: - Length of Cycle 1: i + 1 (since it contains vertices v_{1} to v_{2} to cdots to v_{i} to v_{1}). - Length of Cycle 2: j + 1 (since it contains vertices v_{1} to v_{2} to cdots to v_{j} to v_{1}). - Length of Cycle 3: (j - i + 2) (since it contains vertices v_{1} to v_{i} to v_{i+1} to cdots to v_{j} to v_{1}). 7. **Summation of cycle lengths**: Adding these lengths together: [ text{Total length} = (i + 1) + (j + 1) + (j - i + 2) ] Simplifying this, we get: [ (i + 1) + (j + 1) + (j - i + 2) = i + j + 1 + j + 1 + j - i + 2 = 2j + 4 ] [ 2j + 4 = 2(j + 2) ] Clearly, this total is an even number. 8. **Conclusion—existence of odd cycle**: Since the sum of the lengths of the three cycles is an even number, at least one of these cycles must be of odd length. This is because if all three cycles were even, their total sum would not form an even number. Hence, by pigeonholing (since the sum is even), at least one cycle must be odd. Thus, we have demonstrated that G contains at least one cycle of odd length. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"A stone is dropped into a well, and it's observed that the noise of the stone hitting the bottom is heard 9.5 seconds later.

Let's label the points as (A, B, C), and (D) sequentially on the arc (AD). We have ( widehat{AB} = widehat{BC} = widehat{CD} ). 2. **Intersecting Points on Chord (AD):** Denote the points where (OB) and (OC) intersect chord (AD) as (B_1) and (C_1) respectively. Thus, we have (AC_1 = C_1B_1 = B_1D). 3. **Properties of the Perpendicular Bisector:** The perpendicular bisector of (AD) will also bisect (C_1B_1). Therefore, (triangle C_1B_1O) is isosceles. 4. **Defining Point (E):** Let (E) be the second intersection point of (OC) with the circle (shorter segment of arc (AD)). Then, the triangles (triangle C_1AE) and (triangle C_1B_1O) are congruent due to: - (C_1A = C_1B_1) - They share angle (angle C_1AO), - (angle C_1EA = angle COA = angle COB = angle C_1OB_1). Hence, (AE = B_1O = C_1O = C_1E = frac{r}{2}), where (r) is the radius of the circle. 5. **Conclusion on Existence:** For any arbitrarily chosen point (A), there exists a corresponding point (D) that can be determined by extending the line (AC_1), which bisects (OE) where (OE = frac{r}{2}), making (E) and hence (C_1) uniquely determined.

Then, ( frac{GC_1}{GA} = frac{OC_1}{OA} = frac{1}{2} ), so (G) trisects (AC_1) and thereby (AB_1) as well. 4. **Construction of Circle:** By determining point (B_1) and then point (G), the perpendicular bisector of (AD) can intersect the Thales circle with diameter (GB_1) at (O).

We approach this by breaking down the proof into two parts: divisibility by 4 and divisibility by 3. 1. **Considerations for Divisibility by 4:** - The set of integers modulo 4 can be divided into four equivalence classes: ({4t}, {4t+1}, {4t+2}, {4t+3}). 2. **Case 1: Two numbers are in the same equivalence class modulo 4:** - If there are at least two numbers among (a, b, c, d) that belong to the same class, then their difference is a multiple of 4. - For instance, if ( b = 4t + k ) and (a = 4t' + k), where (k in {0, 1, 2, 3}), then (b - a = 4(t - t')). - Therefore, ((b - a)), and similarly, all corresponding differences where two integers belong to the same class will be multiples of 4. Hence, (A) is divisible by 4. # Case 2: All numbers belong to different equivalence classes modulo 4: - If (a, b, c, d) are in different equivalence classes modulo 4, then there are exactly two even numbers and two odd numbers among them. - The difference between two even or two odd numbers is even. - Hence, at least three of the differences in the product ((b-a)(c-a)(d-a)(b-c)(d-c)(d-b)) will be even, assuring that (A) is divisible by (2^2), i.e., 4. In all cases, the product (A) is divisible by 4. 3. **Considerations for Divisibility by 3:** - The set of integers can also be divided into three equivalence classes modulo 3: ({3t}, {3t+1}, {3t+2}). 4. **Proving Pairwise Differencing Results Modulo 3:** - Given any four numbers (a, b, c, d), by the pigeonhole principle, when divided into 3 classes modulo 3, at least two of them must fall into the same class. - If (a equiv b pmod{3}), their difference (b - a) is a multiple of 3. - Hence, among the factors ((b-a), (c-a), (d-a), (b-c), (d-c), (d-b)), there will always be at least one term that is a multiple of 3. - This ensures that (A) is divisible by 3. Conclusion: Since we have shown that (A) is divisible by both 4 and 3, we can conclude that (A) is divisible by (4 times 3 = 12). Therefore, (A = (b-a)(c-a)(d-a)(b-c)(d-c)(d-b)) is divisible by (12).

Therefore, the string can be broken down into segments of alternating ones and zeros, starting and ending with a one. 4. **Formulating the problem**: Let's denote the number of ones by ( k ). The number of zeros will then be ( 10 - k ). Since no two zeros can be consecutive, the zeros must be placed in the gaps between ones. 5. **Placing the zeros**: If we have ( k ) ones, there are ( k + 1 ) possible positions to place the zeros (before the first one, between ones, and after the last one). We need to place ( 10 - k ) zeros in these ( k + 1 ) positions. 6. **Counting valid strings**: - For ( k = 0 ): There is only 1 string, which is \\"0000000000\\", but it does not satisfy the condition of no two consecutive zeros. - For ( k = 2 ): We need to place 8 zeros in 3 positions, which is not possible. - For ( k = 4 ): We need to place 6 zeros in 5 positions.

As x varies from -1 to 1, arccos x decreases from pi to 0. On the other hand, arctan x increases from around -frac{pi}{4} (when x = -1) to frac{pi}{4} (when x = 1). Next, we solve arccos x = arctan x by substituting theta = arccos x, which implies x = cos{theta}. Therefore, arctan x becomes arctan(cos{theta}) = theta. Hence, arccos(cos{theta}) > arctan(cos{theta}) when theta < arctan(cos{theta}). Using a trigonometric identity, theta = arctan(cos{theta}) Rightarrow tan{theta} = cos{theta}, we need to find the theta satisfying this, which happens when theta = 0.

Given the arrangement, it's visible that adjacent tiles of different rows may be colored the same if we alternate colors correctly. Let's consider a pattern of alternating colors row-wise: - Color the triangles in the first row with two colors alternately (one for upward-pointing, one for downward-pointing). - For trapezoids in the next row, use three colors such that none of them match the two colors used for adjacent triangles. - This covers all the types of tile contacts.

We are given an equilateral triangle with a side length of 6. 3. This equilateral triangle can be divided into smaller equilateral triangles with a side length of 1. 4. Therefore, we can calculate the total number of small equilateral triangles contained within the larger triangle. To determine the total number of small triangles: [ text{Number of small triangles} = 6^2 = 36 ] 5. Now, we need to determine the orientation distribution of these smaller triangles within the larger triangle. Specifically, we count how many triangles point upwards and how many point downwards. 6. By inspection (or by detailed drawing), we can see that in an arrangement where the triangles are laid out in a grid within the larger triangle, the triangles will alternate their orientation. 7. By counting manually or recognizing that half the upward-facing triangles will occupy odd rows and half even rows of the grid: - There are ( 21 ) upward pointing small triangles. - There are ( 15 ) downward pointing small triangles. 8. A \\"sphinx\\" tile in geometrical tiling theory typically covers six smaller triangles. 9. Further, the \\"sphinx\\" tile configuration always covers an even number of upward-facing triangles and an even number of downward-facing triangles. To reason about this: - Considering a single sphinx tile, it covers six smaller triangles: four facing upwards and two facing downwards, or vice versa depending on the orientation of the tile. 10. Therefore, to tile a larger shape with sphinx tiles, the shape must meet the requirement that it contains an even number of both upward and downward-pointing triangles. This is because each tile covers an even number of the respective triangle orientation. 11. Finally, we compare the requirements: - The larger triangle of side length 6 has 21 upward triangles and 15 downward triangles. 12. Since one of these counts (21) is odd and the other (15) is also odd, it means we cannot fulfill the necessity for pairing even quantities of orientational triangles required by the \\"sphinx\\" tiles. # Conclusion: Thus, it is impossible to tile the entire equilateral triangle of side 6 using sphinx tiles due to the orientation mismatch requirement outlined.

Then there is a person between ( a_i ) and ( a_{i+1} ) who has at least two cards (and any other person has at least one card).

This is because if ( sqrt{a} = frac{p}{q} ) for relatively prime positive integers ( p ) and ( q ), then ( frac{p^2}{q^2} ) must be an integer, implying ( q = 1 ). 6.

On September 1st, a few students formed several clubs, each founded by three students. Each day, a student joins a club if they are friends with at least three members of that club. By February 19th, all students in the parallel group were members of the ‘Cheetahs’ club. We need to determine if it is possible that on the same day, the ‘Turtles’ club had exactly 50 members. # Steps: 1. **Group Division:** - Let's split the 100 students into two groups of 50. - Assume that within each group, all students are friends with each other. - Additionally, there are three students ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) from the first group who each have 3 different friends in the second group. 2. **Visual Representation:** [ begin{array}{|c|c|} hline text{Group 1 (50 students, including } A, B, C) & text{Group 2 (50 students)} hline end{array} ] 3. **Formation of Clubs:** - Assume the ‘Cheetahs’ club was formed by any three students from the second group. - On the first day, only members from the second group would join since everyone in the second group is interconnected. - Consequently, after the first day, the club will consist of all 50 students from group 2. 4. **Spreading Membership:** - On the second day, ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) from the first group, being friends with members of the second group, would join the club. - By the third day, since ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) are interconnected among themselves and with the second group, all other students from the first group will eventually join the club within the next few days. 5. **Formation of ‘Turtles’ Club:** - Now assume the ‘Turtles’ club was formed by ( A, B, ) and ( C ) from the first group. - On the next day, the entire first group (50 members) would join, since they all are interconnected with ( A, B, ) and ( C ). - However, nobody from the second group would join since they don’t meet the criterion of having three friends in the first group. 6. **Conclusion:** - Thus, it is possible to have 50 students in the ‘Turtles’ club on February 19th because each club's spread depends on the friend criteria localized to each group's initial members.

Since a, b, and c form an arithmetic sequence, we have a + c = 2b. By the law of sines, we get sin A + sin C = 2sin B. Substitute C = 2A into this equation and apply trigonometric identities: sin A + 2sin A cos A = 2sin 3A = 2sin (A + 2A) = 2sin A cos^2 A + 2cos A sin 2A = 2sin A(4cos^2 A - 1) Simplifying the above equation, we get: 8cos^3 A - 2cos A - 3 = 0 Solving this cubic equation results in cos A = frac{3}{4} or cos A = -frac{1}{2}. We discard cos A = -frac{1}{2} because it does not correspond to an acute angle, which is implied by the angle relationships in the problem. Hence, we have boxed{cos A = frac{3}{4}}. 2. Given a = frac{4m^2 + 4m + 9}{m + 1} and m > 0, to find the minimum value of a, we can rewrite this expression as a = 4(m + 1) + frac{9}{m + 1} - 4 geq 2sqrt{9} - 4 = 8. Equality is achieved when m = frac{1}{2}. As cos A = frac{3}{4}, we find that sin A = frac{sqrt{7}}{4} by using the Pythagorean identity sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1. From the law of sines, frac{a}{sin A} = frac{c}{sin C}, and since sin C = 2sin A cos A = frac{3sqrt{7}}{8}, we deduce that c = frac{3}{2}a. Together with a + c = 2b, we can then find that b = frac{5}{4}a.

To ensure that the sum of the digits in each row and each column is the same, we must first determine the target sum for each row and each column. 4.

We will denote these points of tangency as ({P_i}), where (i) indexes each face of the polyhedron. 3. **Constructing triangles**: - Connect each tangency point (P_i) with all the vertices of the corresponding face. This will divide each face into several triangles. For example, if a face was originally a polygon with (k) edges, it will be divided into (k) triangles converging at (P_i). 4. **Analyzing adjacent faces**: - Consider two adjacent faces (F_1) and (F_2) of the polyhedron. The triangles formed at the edges between these faces will share a common edge. 5. **Equality of triangles**: - Since the sphere is tangent to both faces at the point where they share an edge, the triangles formed by the tangency point and the vertices of each face will be congruent. This implies that the angles sum of these triangles at the shared edge will match accordingly. 6. **Summing angles**: - Summing the angles around each tangency point must equal (2pi), since they form a full circle around the point where the sphere touches. 7. **Counting the number of faces**: - Let the total number of faces of the polyhedron be (n). According to the problem, more than half of these faces are painted black. Thus, the number of black faces is greater than (frac{n}{2}). 8. **Contradicting the angles**: - Because each face is divided into triangles sharing edges with adjacent faces, each black face corresponds to congruent white triangles on neighboring faces. - If the sum of the angles for each face leading to a black face is greater than half of the total (2pi n) (due to having more than half black), this causes a contradiction because the angles summed up for white faces should not be less than the remaining half necessary to fulfill (2pi n). - This geometric and angle distribution setup implies that such a configuration is not feasible under the given conditions (since summing up these contributions should still hold (2pi n), but this setup would imply an inconsistency). 9. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, it is impossible to have more than half of the non-shared, non-adjacent faces painted black and still inscribe a sphere into the polyhedron.

Particularly, we select indices ( i_1, i_2, ldots, i_{frac{M}{2}} ) such that: [ a_{1, i_1} = a_{1, i_2} = cdots = a_{1, i_{frac{M}{2}}} = x_1 quad text{where} quad x_1 in {0, 1}. ] 3. **Subsequent Selections:** From the set ( {i_1, i_2, ldots, i_{frac{M}{2}}} ), we further select ( j_1, j_2, ldots, j_{frac{M}{4}} ) such that: [ a_{j_1, 1} = a_{j_2, 1} = cdots = a_{j_{frac{M}{4}}, 1} = y_1 quad text{where} quad y_1 in {0, 1}. ] 4. **Equality in Elements:** Clearly, we also have: [ a_{1, j_1} = a_{1, j_2} = cdots = a_{1, j_{frac{M}{4}}} = x_1. ] 5. **Formation of Submatrices:** Let the submatrix formed by the elements with row and column indices ( j_1, j_2, ldots, j_{frac{M}{4}} ) be denoted ( B_1 ). Hence, in ( B_1 ): - The first row consists entirely of ( x_1 ). - The first column consists entirely of ( y_1 ). We recursively perform these operations, obtaining matrices ( B_2, B_3, ldots, B_{4m} ), with: [ B_{i+1} text{ as a principal submatrix of } B_i quad text{and} quad text{dimension} quad frac{M}{4^i}. ] 6. **Consistent Selections:** For each constructed ( B_i ): - The first row of ( B_i ) contains ( x_i ). - The first column of ( B_i ) contains ( y_i ), all elements in ( {0,1} ) for ( 1 leq i leq 4m ). Among the sets ( (x_i, y_i) ), there exist ( m ) pairs that are identical, denoted ( (x, y) ). 7. **Obtaining a \\"Nice Matrix\\" ( B ):** Suppose these ( m ) pairs with entries ( (x, y) ) have rows indexed by ( k_1, k_2, ldots, k_m ) in the original matrix. The submatrix with row and column indices ( k_1, k_2, ldots, k_m ) forms a \\"nice matrix\\" ( B ), with consistency in its structure. 8. **Ramsey Theory Application:** Finally, consider coloring edges of the complete graph ( K_n ) (representing connections between matrix entries) in four colors based on the values of ( a_{i,j} ): - Red if ( a_{i,j} = a_{j,i} = 0 ) - Green if ( a_{i,j} = 0 ) and ( a_{j,i} = 1 ) - Blue if ( a_{i,j} = 1 ) and ( a_{j,i} = 0 ) - White if ( a_{i,j} = a_{j,i} = 1 ) By Ramsey's theorem, taking ( M = R(m, m, m, m, 2) ) ensures that for ( n > M ), ( K_n ) necessarily contains a monochromatic complete subgraph ( K_m ), directly translating to a \\"nice matrix\\" ( B_m ). Thus, there indeed exists an integer ( M ) such that for any ( n > M ) and any ( n times n ) binary matrix ( A_n ), one can find a submatrix ( B_m ) which is a \\"nice matrix\\".

Relative speed in m/s = 72 kmph * (5/18) m/s/kmph Relative speed in m/s = 20 m/s Now, we know the time taken to overtake is 17 seconds, so the distance covered during this time is the length of the faster train.

Start by trying to color edges between different groups and minimizing in-group edges. 6. **Detailed movement/counter checking:** - Any deviation from maximum distribution can be corrected by considering movements that increase inter-group edges to reduce intra-group edges, ensuring the condition holds. 7. **Conclusion:** - Given the 2022 people can be divided such that each person’s friends are optimally distributed per these groups, it meets the required criteria.

We can choose a coordinate system such that both the x_i and y_i coordinates are pairwise distinct. This is possible by rotating the coordinate system to avoid the situation where any two points share the same x or y coordinate. By eliminating a finite number of particular orientations (where the axes are parallel to any line formed by two of the n points), we ensure that each point has uniquely distinct x_i and y_i values. 2. **Order by x-coordinates**: Without loss of generality, we can rename the points such that the x-coordinates are in increasing order: x_1 < x_2 < cdots < x_n. Hence, the points (x_i, y_i) are ordered by their x-coordinates. 3. **Erdős–Szekeres Theorem (Increasing Subsequence)**: According to the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, any sequence of real numbers of length n contains a monotonically increasing or decreasing subsequence of length at least lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor. 4. **Application to y-Coordinates**: Given the points (x_i, y_i), the sequence of y-coordinates {y_1, y_2, ldots, y_n} must contain a monotonically increasing or decreasing subsequence of length at least lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor. Let's denote this subsequence as { y_{i_1}, y_{i_2}, ldots, y_{i_k} } with k geq lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor. 5. **Non-Equilateral Triangles**: The key observation here is that if the points corresponding to the y_i values in our subsequence form a monotone sequence, then no three points among them can form an equilateral triangle. This is because the equilateral triangle requires symmetrical spacing in both the x and y directions, which is not possible when the y-coordinates are strictly increasing or decreasing. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, among the n points, we can always find at least lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor points such that no three of them form an equilateral triangle.

Thus, any sequence of 60 binary digits can indeed be divided into at most 24 palindromic pieces. 2. **Minimum Pieces Example**: Now we want to give an example of a string that requires at least 15 palindromic pieces.
