Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won’t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018 Thread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up where a new look with a digital online video style is coming to the block mid April, Also the slogan shown in the Feb promo is official, Also, 3 of the KWB shows are going, with CL and G&G staying, Also, Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer and Viva Pinata are joining the lineup, this also happens from mid April, Pokemon is also being swapped for Pokemon Horizons: The Series Thread Title: CW4Kids New Digital Look & Lineup Shuffle – Mid-April Madness Incoming! 💥📺 ToonMasterJay: Mid-April’s gonna hit us with a serious 1-2 punch, folks! We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up where a user asks why Beyblade Metal Fusion and One Piece are not included, and a user says its because they are keeping 2 shows, and there's no room because they also want Sonic X, Kirby and Chaotic on the lineup, and since Redakai is coming in the fall, you can expect to be waiting a long while, unless they take out Viva Pinata or something","completion":"Thread Title: Questions on Beyblade Metal Fusion & One Piece Absence in CW4Kids Lineup 🤔🌀 CuriousFan98: Been following the rolling updates on our beloved CW4Kids, and something's been bugging me. Why no love for Beyblade Metal Fusion and One Piece? Both are heavy hitters in the anime world, and I'd argue they have a solid fanbase ready to tune in. What gives? AnimeAddict101: You’ve got a point, but I think it's a matter of space and strategy. Keeping Code Lyoko and “Gloopy and Glitter” means CW4Kids is striking a balance, not just throwing in every popular title. Plus, with Sonic X, Kirby, and Chaotic securing spots, room's kinda tight. DigitalToonFan: Exactly. If we look at the lineup, it's clear there's a desire to maintain a diverse mix. Between reviving classics like Sonic X, Kirby, and introducing Chaotic into the mix, it's a balancing act. And with Redakai slated for fall, seems they're stacking their anime and action cards closely. SonicXforever: Honestly, I'm surprised Viva Piñata made the cut over Beyblade or One Piece. No shade, but when it comes to hardcore fan favorites, those two have legions! Maybe it's about aiming for that variety spice—mixing genres and audiences. GoGoFan223: And don't forget, the return of Chaotic is a big deal for strategy game fans. The lineup seems to aim at not just anime lovers but also at pulling in fans of different genres. Beyblade and One Piece might just be too similar to Pokémon Horizons in the anime-action slot. PokeNostalgia101: Speaking of Pokémon Horizons, it's a fresh start for Pokémon lovers on CW4Kids. Bringing in Beyblade or One Piece might overshadow this new beginning. Maybe the network is betting on Horizons to bring in the anime crowd for now. LyokoLover: It’s a pity, though. One Piece especially has such a rich world that could hook viewers for a solid adventure. But with Redakai on the horizon, perhaps they're banking on newer titles to freshen things up even more. WebWader: I’d argue Viva Piñata could be switched out for either, but it probably adds that non-action, quirky element the lineup needs. It's all about casting a wide net—grabbing viewers with different tastes. ToonTalker91: I’m holding out hope that feedback might shift future considerations. Beyblade Metal Fusion and One Piece deserve a slot. Until then, seems we're set for a variety-packed lineup with something for both the modern and the nostalgic crowd. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Appreciate the enthusiasm and suggestions, everyone! The current lineup is designed to deliver diversity and ensure a wide appeal. Keep the feedback coming, and stay tuned for future updates. Who knows what surprises we have in store down the line?

The community's yearning is palpable! AnimeAddict101: Personally, I think the likelihood hinges on how CW4Kids plans to evolve. Given the emphasis on diversifying the lineup and the upcoming addition of Redakai, they’re clearly open to experimenting. If fan demand stays strong, I see no reason why they wouldn't consider adding Beyblade and One Piece in the future. SonicXforever: Agreed! Plus, the CW4Kids block seems to be in a period of transition and testing. Shows like Gloopy and Glitter are still in, which tells me they're banking on variety. If there’s room for growth and a clear want from the audience, chances are we might see our beloved series make a comeback. GoGoFan223: It might be a game of patience and persistence from us fans. Initiatives like petitions or social media buzz could indicate to CW4Kids the potential viewership they’re missing out on. Beyblade and One Piece have international acclaim; it’s a matter of when, not if. DigitalToonFan: True, but it’s also about licensing complexities and market strategy. The arrival of Pokémon Horizons shows a willingness to include popular anime. It’s a crowded field, and each slot on the lineup is precious. If one of the current shows doesn’t perform as expected, it could open the door. WebWader: Something else to consider is how they manage their digital platform. If CW4Kids sees success in online engagement, it could be an ideal testing ground for Beyblade and One Piece without disrupting the main TV slot balance. PokeNostalgia101: I’m all up for that! Showing support on digital platforms is a direct way to showcase interest. Plus, it might be easier for CW4Kids to experiment with airing episodes online before fully committing to the broadcast schedule. LyokoLover: Exactly! Optimism is key here. The CW4Kids admins seem attentive to feedback—at least, that’s the vibe from Admin_4KidsRevamp’s posts. Let’s keep the conversation going, show our support, and who knows? Future updates might just surprise us. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Appreciate the lively discussion, everyone! While we can't spill too many details just yet, rest assured, we're constantly reviewing our lineup and listening to what our viewers want to see. Stay tuned for announcements and never say never to future possibilities! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp"},{"prompt":"Write that if they are added, they are likely to replace Viva Pinata and TMNT, and tell us what they certainly will not replace","completion":"Thread Title: Potential Replacements If Beyblade & One Piece Join CW4Kids 🔄📺 CuriousFan98: If the much-requested Beyblade and One Piece are ever added to the CW4Kids lineup, it's been hinted they might replace Viva Piñata and TMNT: Back to the Sewer. While any change is speculative, it makes sense given the genre alignment and audience interest. AnimeAddict101: That would be an interesting shakeup. Viva Piñata, while unique, hasn't stirred as much buzz. TMNT has its die-hard fans, but Beyblade and One Piece could bring in a broader international viewer base. It's all about striking that balance between freshness and nostalgia. SonicXforever: It’s clear, though, that some shows are here to stay. Shows like \\"Gloopy and Glitter\\" and \\"Code Lyoko\\" bring a different flavor to the block, aligning with the theme of diversity and innovation CW4Kids seems to be aiming for. GoGoFan223: Exactly, and let’s not forget Pokémon Horizons: The Series. Its recent addition marks a significant commitment to high-profile anime content, making it unlikely for replacement. It seems CW4Kids is keen on maintaining a strong anime presence alongside their unique animated series. DigitalToonFan: Plus, considering the digital revamp and the emphasis on interactive features, replacing shows with a strong digital footprint like \\"Code Lyoko\\" would go against the grain of the current strategy. It’s more than just the show; it’s the thematic connection to CW4Kids’ vision. WebWader: If Beyblade and One Piece are added, focusing on what they will not replace is crucial for understanding CW4Kids' long-term strategy. It’s apparent there’s a commitment to preserving a core set of shows that align with its digital innovation and narrative diversity goals. PokeNostalgia101: Bringing in Beyblade and One Piece could indeed rejuvenate the lineup, but it’s comforting to know there are untouchables that define the CW4Kids brand. Expanding without losing the essence of what makes the block unique seems to be the guiding principle. LyokoLover: It’s a delicate balance, but one that could pay off by attracting new viewers while satisfying the existing audience. The potential replacement of shows like Viva Piñata and TMNT might just be the refresh CW4Kids needs to stay competitive and relevant. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We're always exploring ways to evolve and enhance our lineup based on viewer feedback and market trends. While we can't confirm any specific changes at this time, we're committed to providing a mix of entertainment that appeals to our diverse audience.

This condition indicates that a write operation is requested. \`\`\`systemverilog assign wren = psel_i & penable_i & pwrite_i; \`\`\` 2. **Handling Write Operations inside always block**: - You should update your configuration registers based on the address (paddr_i) and the write enable signal (\`wren\`). - For DMA start command, you compare the \`paddr_i\` to a specific address (\`DMA_CMD\`) and check if \`pwdata_i\` is 1. \`\`\`systemverilog always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin if (!rst_n) begin src_addr <= 0; dst_addr <= 0; byte_len <= 0; end else if (wren) begin case (paddr_i) \`SRC_ADDR: src_addr <= pwdata_i; \`DST_ADDR: dst_addr <= pwdata_i; \`LEN_ADDR: byte_len <= pwdata_i[15:0]; // Handle other addresses including DMA_CMD for start command endcase end end \`\`\` 3. **Start Signal Calculation**: - Assuming \`DMA_CMD\` is the start command's address. \`\`\`systemverilog wire start_condition; // Define the start condition based on your design assign start = (paddr_i == \`START_ADDR) && pwdata_i[0] && wren; \`\`\` # DMAC_CFG_TB.sv - Simulating the Design Your testbench is well laid out for simulating writes to the DMA controller and reading back the status. To effectively use it: 1. **Ensure proper initialization**: - Your tasks for write and read through the APB interface are correctly implemented. Remember to call these tasks at appropriate times after reset deassertion and wait for some clock cycles as necessary. 2. **Simulation Sequences**: - The test sequences you already planned (\`Reset value test\`, \`Configuration test\`, and \`DMA start\`) seem comprehensive. Make sure each step is verified by checking the actual value against the expected value and report any discrepancies. 3. **Completion and Timeout**: - Your timeout mechanism is important to prevent simulations from hanging indefinitely. The logic for waiting for DMA completion by polling a status register is correctly used. 4. **Waveform Generation**: - With \`dumpvars\`, you're set to generate waveform data. Good practice for debugging. # General Recommendation Before running your simulations, ensure all paths (\`LAB_PATH/...\`) are correctly defined and accessible by your simulation tool. Also, make sure your environment variables or simulation scripts correctly point to these directories. Review all placeholders like \`/* FLOATING */\` and ensure proper connections or assignments to prevent floating signals in your testbench. Lastly, after completing the implementation sections marked with \`// fill your code here\`, compile and run your simulations, then observe the waveform and log outputs to verify functionality per your design specifications. Simulation and continuous integration tools help automate these checks, making iterative testing more efficient."},{"prompt":"Can cellulose and hemicellulose be extracted from mango peel the same way?","completion":"Cellulose and hemicellulose can indeed be extracted from mango peel, but the processes for extracting each may vary due to the differences in their chemical and physical properties. Both cellulose and hemicellulose are polysaccharides found in the cell walls of plants and are major components of lignocellulosic biomass, such as mango peel. However, their structures and the bonds between their molecules differ. # General Steps for Biomass Pre-treatment 1. **Size Reduction**: The first step is usually to reduce the size of the biomass to increase the surface area. For mango peels, this might involve drying and grinding. 2. **Pre-treatment**: Pre-treatment methods can vary but are crucial for breaking down the lignin structure and disrupting the crystalline structure of cellulose, enhancing the accessibility of chemical agents or enzymes to cellulose and hemicellulose. Common pre-treatment methods include: - Chemical (using acids, alkalis, organic solvents, ionic liquids) - Physical (milling, grinding) - Physicochemical (steam explosion, ammonia fiber explosion) - Biological (using specific microorganisms or enzymes) # Extracting Hemicellulose Hemicellulose is easier to hydrolyze than cellulose due to its amorphous structure and can be extracted using milder conditions. Acidic or alkaline pre-treatments can be effective. For example, dilute acid hydrolysis can break down hemicellulose into fermentable sugars. Alternatively, alkaline pre-treatment (e.g., using sodium hydroxide) can also extract hemicellulose while causing less degradation to the sugars than acidic methods. # Extracting Cellulose The extraction of cellulose, particularly from a complex matrix like mango peel, typically requires more rigorous conditions to remove lignin and hemicellulose, which sheath and intermingle with the cellulose fibers. Alkaline pre-treatments are commonly used to dissolve lignin and part of the hemicellulose, making the cellulose more accessible. This might be followed by bleaching to further purify the cellulose. # Considerations and Specific Methods - **Environmental Impact**: The choice of extraction method should consider the environmental impact, including the use of toxic chemicals and the generation of waste products. - **Efficiency and Yield**: The efficiency of cellulose and hemicellulose extraction and the yield depend on the chosen method, the specific type of biomass, and the conditions applied (temperature, duration, concentration of chemical agents, etc.). - **Enzymatic Hydrolysis**: After pre-treatment, enzymatic hydrolysis can be employed to further break down cellulose and hemicellulose into fermentable sugars, which can then be used for various bio-based products. Given the complexity of biomass like mango peel and the intertwined nature of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin within it, a combination of methods or a sequential multi-step approach is often necessary to effectively extract cellulose and hemicellulose with high purity and yield. The appropriateness of the method would depend on the intended use of the extracted polysaccharides, cost considerations, and environmental impact."},{"prompt":"как сместить вправо <div class=\\"header-line-title\\">Оплатить с помощью</div>","completion":"Для того чтобы сместить элемент <div class=\\"header-line-title\\">Оплатить с помощью</div> вправо, можно использовать CSS-свойство text-align и задать ему значение right.

But i'm smart, catchy and ready to learn. Based on that, could you recommend me 2-3 jobs in IT which i can start to learn? No sarcasm, please","completion":"Absolutely, I’d be glad to offer some guidance! Transitioning into the IT field is a fantastic move, especially considering your readiness to learn. Given your starting point, I'll recommend a few career paths that are relatively accessible for beginners and have good potential for growth. For each of these, there are abundant resources online such as courses, tutorials, and communities to support your journey. # 1. Web Development Starting as a web developer might be a great option. Web development generally splits into two main categories: front-end (the visual part of the website that users interact with) and back-end (the server, database, and application logic). As a beginner, it might be more straightforward to start with **front-end development**, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the building blocks of the web and can provide a satisfying entry point into programming. Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can move on to learning frameworks and libraries like ReactJS (for front-end) or Node.js (for back-end). # Resources to Get Started: - FreeCodeCamp - Codecademy - The Odin Project # 2. IT Support Specialist An IT support role can be a great entry point into the technology field that capitalizes on your problem-solving skills and your ability to learn quickly. While not as \\"hardcore\\" coding-focused as other roles, IT support specialists need a strong understanding of computer systems, networks, and occasionally basic scripting to automate their tasks. Starting with a foundational understanding of computer hardware, operating systems (like Windows and Linux), and networks will set a good base for this path. You might consider getting the CompTIA A+ certification, which is well-regarded in the IT support field. # Resources to Get Started: - Google IT Support Professional Certificate (Coursera) - CompTIA A+ Certification prep materials (CompTIA's website, Professor Messer's YouTube channel) # 3. Data Analysis Data analysis is another growing field that can be more accessible for beginners. It involves collecting, processing, and performing statistical analyses on data. With businesses increasingly relying on data to make informed decisions, there's a high demand for data analysts. Starting out, you’d want to focus on learning Excel thoroughly, then move on to more advanced tools like SQL (for database querying), Python (particularly libraries like pandas and NumPy for data manipulation), and Tableau (for data visualization). # Resources to Get Started: - Khan Academy (for statistics basics) - Coursera and edX (for Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau courses) - DataCamp (for learning Python and R for data science) # Conclusion The key to success in any of these fields is hands-on practice. Working on projects (no matter how small) is a great way to apply what you’re learning and to build a portfolio that you can show to potential employers. The IT field values practical skills and problem-solving abilities highly, so demonstrating that you can do the job often outweighs traditional educational credentials. Remember, it's perfectly okay to start small and grow from there. Every expert was once a beginner, and the IT field is known for its dynamic environment and opportunities for continual learning and improvement. Best of luck on your new career path!"},{"prompt":"thank you","completion":"You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further assistance as you embark on your new career path, feel free to reach out. Best of luck with your learning and future endeavors in the IT field!"},{"prompt":"as for data analysis do you think AI would be able to replace human knowledge in that field?","completion":"The question of AI replacing human roles, especially in fields like data analysis, touches on a complex and evolving discussion. While AI and machine learning have indeed made significant strides in automating various tasks within data analysis, there are several aspects to consider when thinking about the extent to which AI can replace human involvement. # Advances in AI AI has become increasingly capable of performing a range of tasks that were traditionally done by data analysts. This includes: - **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Automating the process of cleaning data and preparing it for analysis, which can be time-consuming when done manually. - **Pattern Recognition:** AI excels at identifying patterns in large datasets more quickly and sometimes more accurately than a human can. - **Predictive Analytics:** Machine learning models can make predictions based on historical data, which is a key component of data analysis in various fields. # The Human Element Despite these advances, there are several reasons why AI is unlikely to entirely replace human knowledge and intuition in data analysis: - **Interpretation and Context:** While AI can identify patterns and correlations, human judgment is often needed to interpret these findings within the broader context of the specific domain or business needs. Understanding the \\"why\\" behind the data often requires domain expertise and critical thinking. - **Ethical Considerations and Bias:** Human oversight is necessary to navigate ethical considerations, particularly in making decisions that impact people's lives based on data analysis. Additionally, humans are needed to identify and mitigate biases that may exist in data or in AI algorithms themselves. - **Creativity and Innovation:** Data analysis is not just about examining historical data but also about asking new questions and hypothesizing future trends. The creative aspect of hypothesizing and designing new experiments or models is something AI cannot replicate. # Complementary Roles In many ways, the future of data analysis is not about AI replacing humans but rather how AI can augment human capabilities. AI can handle more mundane, repetitive tasks, allowing human analysts to focus on higher-level analysis, strategy, and decision-making. This synergy can lead to more efficient and insightful data analysis processes. # Conclusion While AI will transform the field of data analysis by automating certain tasks and enhancing analytical capabilities, it's unlikely to completely replace the human element. Human intuition, ethical judgment, creativity, and contextual understanding remain critical. As the field evolves, the most successful data analysts will likely be those who learn to leverage AI as a powerful tool in their arsenal, rather than those who see it as a replacement for human skills."},{"prompt":"Реферат на тему капиллярные методы обнаружения дефектов","completion":"Капиллярные методы обнаружения дефектов # Введение Капиллярные методы обнаружения дефектов являются одними из наиболее распространенных и эффективных неразрушающих методов контроля качества в различных отраслях промышленности. Эти методы позволяют обнаружить поверхностные и близко расположенные к поверхности микротрещины, поры, сквозные и непрерывные открытые дефекты в материалах и изделиях, не повреждая их структуру. # Принцип действия Капиллярное проникновение – явление, основанное на способности жидкости подниматься вверх против силы тяжести в узком промежутке или трубке (капилляре) благодаря силам капиллярного действия. Капиллярные методы используют этот принцип, применяя специальные растворы (пенетранты), которые способны проникать в тонкие трещины и поры на поверхности материала. # Основные этапы процедуры 1. **Подготовка поверхности**: удаление грязи, ржавчины, краски и других загрязнений для обеспечения надежного контакта пенетранта с поверхностью. 2. **Нанесение пенетранта**: равномерное нанесение пенетранта на поверхность контролируемого объекта и его внедрение в дефекты под действием капиллярных сил. 3. **Время выдержки**: обеспечивается необходимое время для полного проникновения пенетранта во все возможные дефекты. 4. **Удаление излишков пенетранта**: излишки пенетранта удаляются с поверхности, не затрагивая тот, что проник в дефекты. 5. **Нанесение разработчика (девелопера)**: разработчик обычно представляет собой порошок или жидкость, наносимую на поверхность. Он абсорбирует пенетрант из дефектов, обеспечивая их визуализацию. 6. **Интерпретация и оценка результатов**: анализ изменений на поверхности с учетом проникновения пенетранта и выведения его разработчиком, позволяет определить наличие, размеры и расположение дефектов. # Преимущества и недостатки **Преимущества:** - Высокая чувствительность к мелким дефектам на поверхности и близко расположенным под ней. - Простота и низкая стоимость оборудования. - Возможность применения к большинству материалов. **Недостатки:** - Ограниченность применения только к открытым поверхностям и доступностью дефектов для пенетранта. - Необходимость тщательной подготовки поверхности. - Возможность субъективной оценки результатов. # Применение Капиллярные методы находят широкое применение в авиационной, нефтегазовой, атомной, судостроительной промышленности, и других отраслях, где требуется высокая надежность и безопасность конструкций и материалов. Они используются для контроля сварных соединений, литейных изделий, механической обработки деталей и других изделий, подверженных динамическим и статическим нагрузкам. # Заключение Капиллярные методы обнаружения дефектов играют важную роль в обеспечении качества и безопасности производимой продукции. Благодаря своей чувствительности и простоте применения, они занимают важное место среди других неразрушающих методов контроля. Однако необходимо учитывать возможные ограничения и требования к квалификации персонала при их использовании для достижения максимальной эффективности и надежности результатов."},{"prompt":"Medicines that prevent disease include Multiple choice question.

Кратко.","completion":"Основные положения классической теории электропроводности металлов, разработанной на основе работ Друде и Лоренца, можно кратко изложить следующим образом: 1. **Свободные электроны**: В металлах существует большое количество свободных электронов, которые могут перемещаться по всему объему металла. Эти свободные электроны представляют собой носители электрического тока в металлах. 2. **Тепловое движение**: Электроны находятся в постоянном тепловом движении, сталкиваясь с ионами кристаллической решетки металла. 3. **Воздействие электрического поля**: При приложении внешнего электрического поля свободные электроны приобретают дополнительную скорость в направлении, противоположном направлению электрического поля (так как электроны заряжены отрицательно). Это упорядоченное движение электронов и создает электрический ток. 4. **Омическое сопротивление**: Столкновения между электронами и ионами кристаллической решетки приводят к омическому сопротивлению материала. С увеличением температуры количество столкновений увеличивается, что приводит к росту сопротивления. 5. **Закон Ома**: Электрический ток в металле пропорционален приложенному напряжению и обратно пропорционален сопротивлению металла, что является математическим выражением закона Ома. Эта теория, хотя и описывает многие основные аспекты электропроводности металлов, не учитывает квантовые эффекты, возникающие на микроскопическом уровне, и поэтому с ней связаны некоторые ограничения.

Discord also requires usernames to be more than two characters long, and most simple three-letter combinations are likely already in use. However, I can suggest some creative three-letter combinations. To verify their availability on Discord, you'd need to check directly on the platform or use its nickname feature along with a discriminating tag (the four digits that follow a username) for uniqueness. Here are some creatively inspired, three-letter combinations that strive for uniqueness: 1. 1Xq 2. Z3r 3. Q8v 4. V9z 5. X0m 6. N7k 7. L4d 8. F3x 9. J2w 10.

Ф. Рахимкулова выделяет следующую классификацию каламбуров: 1. Созвучные слова и словосочетания (парономазия): а) обыгрывание случайных созвучий и групп слов; б) каламбурная омонимия (с использованием полных омонимов, омофонов, омографов, окказиональной омонимии и омоформ); в) искусственное создание омонимии; г) каламбурные рифмы. 2.

М. Люксембург и Г. Ф. Рахимкулова перечисляют следующие функции каламбура: структурообразующая; аллюзивная; ироническая; абсурдистская; интеллектуальной игры с читателем; характеристики персонажа; выражения эмоционального состояния персонажа; маркировки авторского присутствия или скрытого присутствия того или иного персонажа","completion":"Каламбур как языковой прием может выполнять различные функции в тексте, обогащая его содержание и форму. Вот более подробный разбор каждой из функций каламбура, приведенных А.М. Люксембургом и Г.Ф. Рахимкуловой, с примерами: # 1. Структурообразующая Функция Эта функция каламбура позволяет формировать или поддерживать структуру текста. Каламбур может выступать в качестве крепежного или связывающего элемента между разными частями текста, создавая особенный ритм или стиль нарратива. **Пример:** Использование одних и тех же каламбурных фразеологизмов в начале и конце рассказа как рамки, оформляющей текст. # 2. Аллюзивная Функция Через каламбуры можно создавать тонкие отсылки к другим произведениям, историческим событиям, культурным феноменам, тем самым обогащая текст дополнительными смыслами. **Пример:** Использование каламбура в тексте, который является игрой слов, основанной на названии известного произведения или имени автора, подразумевая ассоциации и параллели. # 3. Ироническая Функция Каламбуры часто используются для выражения иронии, переворачивая ожидаемые значения слов с ног на голову и создавая юмористический эффект. **Пример:** Когда герой романа называет свою работу \\"великим делом\\", имея в виду тяжелую, но абсолютно незначительную трудовую деятельность. # 4. Абсурдистская Функция Этот прием позволяет создавать эффект абсурда через острые несоответствия между формой и содержанием, демонстрируя нелепость некоторых явлений или поведения персонажей. **Пример:** \\"Жил-был король весело на две страны, пока не распился на четыре.\\" # 5. Интеллектуальной Игры с Читателем Каламбур может стать способом интеллектуального общения с читателем, вызывая у умственную активность и давая возможность \\"расшифровать\\" скрытые смыслы. **Пример:** \\"Он стоял на пороге великих открытий. Но жена заставила его вытирать ноги.\\" # 6. Характеристика Персонажа Через каламбуры можно выстроить или подчеркнуть определенные черты персонажей, делая их ярче и выразительнее. **Пример:** Главный герой шутит над каждой ситуацией, демонстрируя свой острый ум и скептицизм. # 7. Выражение Эмоционального Состояния Персонажа С помощью каламбура можно отразить внутреннее состояние персонажа, его чувства и эмоции. **Пример:** \\"Она сказала 'люблю' так холодно, что мои чувства замерзли насмерть.\\" # 8. Маркировка Авторского или Скрытого Присутствия Персонажа Каламбур может служить своеобразным вмешательством автора в текст или указанием на присутствие в нарративе кого-то, кто до этого момента оставался в тени. **Пример:** В тексте внезапно появляется игривое словосочетание или фраза, которая сильно контрастирует с общим тоном и стилем произведения, демонстрируя \\"маскировку\\" автора или другого персонажа. Все эти функции каламбура делают его мощным инструментом в руках писателя, позволяя вносить в текст глубину, многослойность и индивидуальность."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Voici les étapes générales pour y parvenir : # 1. Intégrer Keycloak avec Angular Avant de commencer, assurez-vous d'avoir un serveur Keycloak en cours d'exécution et que votre client Keycloak est configuré pour votre application Angular. 1. **Installer la bibliothèque Keycloak Angular**: Utilisez npm ou yarn pour installer le wrapper Keycloak pour Angular. \`\`\`bash npm install keycloak-angular keycloak-js \`\`\` 2. **Configurer Keycloak dans Angular**: Configurez Keycloak dans votre module principal (par exemple, \`app.module.ts\`) en utilisant \`KeycloakAngularModule\` et fournissez une fonction d'initialisation. \`\`\`typescript // app.module.ts import { KeycloakAngularModule, KeycloakService } from 'keycloak-angular'; function initializeKeycloak(keycloak: KeycloakService) { return () => keycloak.init({ config: { url: 'URL_DU_SERVEUR_KEYCLOAK', realm: 'REALM_NAME', clientId: 'CLIENT_ID', }, initOptions: { onLoad: 'login-required', checkLoginIframe: false, }, }); } @NgModule({ imports: [KeycloakAngularModule, ...], providers: [ { provide: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: initializeKeycloak, multi: true, deps: [KeycloakService], }, ], }) export class AppModule {} \`\`\` # 2. Protéger les routes avec des rôles Pour limiter l'accès aux routes en fonction des rôles, vous pouvez utiliser des gardes de route. 1. **Créer un garde de route**: Créez un service Angular qui implémente \`CanActivate\`. Dans cet exemple, le garde vérifie si l'utilisateur possède un rôle spécifique avant de lui autoriser l'accès à une route. \`\`\`typescript // role.guard.ts import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot } from '@angular/router'; import { KeycloakService } from 'keycloak-angular'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root', }) export class RoleGuard implements CanActivate { constructor(private keycloakService: KeycloakService) {} canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): boolean { const requiredRoles = route.data.roles; const userRoles = this.keycloakService.getUserRoles(); // Vérifie si l'utilisateur possède au moins un des rôles requis return userRoles.some(role => requiredRoles.includes(role)); } } \`\`\` 2. **Utiliser le garde de route dans votre routing**: Ajoutez le garde à vos définitions de route en définissant la propriété \`data\` avec les rôles requis pour cette route. \`\`\`typescript // app-routing.module.ts import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router'; import { RoleGuard } from './role.guard'; const routes: Routes = [ { path: 'chemin-securise', canActivate: [RoleGuard], data: { roles: ['admin', 'user'] }, // Rôles requis loadChildren: ... }, // Autres routes... ]; @NgModule({ imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)], exports: [RouterModule], }) export class AppRoutingModule {} \`\`\` # 3. Testez Votre Application Assurez-vous que tout fonctionne comme prévu.

If the peel was dried, how much more pectin would've been extracted?","completion":"To determine how much more pectin could have been extracted from the mango peel if it was dried, we need more specific details about the moisture content of the fresh peel, the yield efficiency of the extraction process for dry versus fresh materials, and any changes in the pectin content due to drying. Pectin extraction efficiency can vary widely based on several factors including the method of extraction, the condition of the raw material (such as moisture content), and specific characteristics of the pectin itself. However, in a general sense, drying the mango peel could potentially increase the yield of pectin in a couple of ways: 1. **Reduced Moisture Content:** Drying reduces the moisture content, so a greater proportion of the material consists of substances like pectin. This doesn't necessarily mean that the absolute amount of pectin increases, but rather that the pectin makes up a larger fraction of the dried material's weight than it did in the wet material. So, if extraction processes are based on the weight of the starting material, drying could appear to increase the yield. 2. **Increased Extraction Efficiency:** Some extraction methods might be more efficient with drier materials, either due to reduced interference from water or because the drying process might make the cell walls more brittle and the pectin easier to extract. Without specific information, we can speculate that drying the peels would increase the efficiency of pectin extraction based on the fact that less mass in water content would mean a higher concentration of pectin per gram of dried peel. To calculate any specific increase in yield, we need detailed information like: - The moisture content of the fresh versus dried peels. - How the yield of pectin changes with changes in moisture content. - Any specific details on how the extraction process's efficiency changes with the condition of the peel. Without this information, it's not possible to provide a specific increase in the pectin extracted from dried mango peels compared to fresh. Generally speaking, drying could increase the yield by concentrating the peel's pectin content and potentially making extraction more efficient, but the exact amount of increase would depend on the factors mentioned above."},{"prompt":"the typical moisture content of the peel is between 59-69%","completion":"Assuming the typical moisture content of fresh mango peel is between 59-69%, let's calculate a rough estimate of how drying could affect the pectin yield.

First, let's find out the dry matter content in the 60g of fresh peel: - (60g times (100% - 64%) = 60g times 36% = 21.6g ) of dry matter. The extraction yield based on the fresh peel mass is: - (frac{0.997g , text{of pectin}}{60g , text{of fresh peel}} = 0.0166 , text{or} , 1.66%) If we consider the extraction based on dry matter, the yield is: - (frac{0.997g , text{of pectin}}{21.6g , text{of dry matter}} approx 0.0461 , text{or} , 4.61%) **Hypothetical Scenario for Dried Peels:** Now, let's hypothetically dry the peel fully, assuming we're removing all the moisture content for simplicity. - In the wet scenario, 60g of peels were not fully dry but contained 21.6g of dry matter. If we consider the efficiency might improve with drying due to possibly easier extraction (an assumption since exact details can vary), but we'll use the same efficiency for simplicity, the yield calculation would still be based on 21.6g since that's the actual dry matter we started with. Therefore, the pectin yield doesn't inherently increase by drying in terms of the absolute amount obtained from a given amount of dry matter; it remains limited by the dry matter's actual pectin content. Drying mainly impacts the extraction efficiency and the perception of yield relative to the weight of the input material since you’re working with a less diluted source (more pectin per gram of dry peel versus wet peel). **Conclusion:** Without specific details on how drying impacts the efficiency of pectin extraction quantitatively, we cannot definitively say how much more pectin could have been extracted. The key factor would be the increase in extraction efficiency due to drying, which is not quantified here. However, the fundamental limit is the pectin content in the dry matter itself. Drying the peel would remove water, concentrating the pectin and possibly making extraction slightly more efficient, but the total yield of pectin you could get is ultimately limited by how much pectin is present in the peel's dry matter. Our calculations show the yield based on the dry matter content, but without increasing the efficiency of the extraction process itself (which could be impacted by a number of factors including drying), we cannot specify an additional amount of pectin that would have been extracted just by the process of drying."},{"prompt":"Are any of these mango cultivars - ‘nam dok mai’, ‘chok anan’, ‘mahachanok’, and ‘kaew’ - similar to Keitt mangoes","completion":"The Keitt mango is known for its large size, sweet flavor, limited fiber, and long shelf life, distinguishing it in the broad family of mango cultivars. The other mango varieties you mentioned also have their unique characteristics. Let's compare them. # 1. Nam Dok Mai This is a Thai mango cultivar known for its elongated shape, golden yellow skin when ripe, and sweet, aromatic, fiberless flesh. It's primarily used for fresh consumption and is highly valued for its sweetness and rich flavor. While it shares the sweetness and limited fiber characteristics with the Keitt mango, Nam Dok Mai is more aromatic and has a different shape and ripening color. # 2. Chok Anan (or Chocanon) Originating from India and also popular in Thailand, the Chok Anan is sometimes known as the \\"Honey Mango\\" or \\"Miracle Mango\\" and is unique for its ability to fruit twice a year. It is recognized by its ovate shape, yellow skin when ripe, and notably, the presence of a distinctive point at the apex. It has a sweet and aromatic flavor with minimal fiber. Though Chok Anan shares the sweet taste and low fiber, its bi-annual fruiting capacity and physical characteristics set it apart from Keitt. # 3. Mahachanok Mahachanok is another Thai mango variety known for its elongated shape with a slight curve, vibrant red blush over a yellow background when ripe, and wonderfully fragrant, sweet, and slightly tangy flesh with minimal fiber. It was developed from a cross between the Thai Sunset mango and a local Thai mango, Saipan. Its unique coloration and flavor profile can distinguish Mahachanok from the Keitt mango. # 4. Kaew Kaew is a variety known for its green skin, even when ripe, and sweet yet firmer flesh. It's commonly used in Thai cuisine for both unripe and ripe consumption. Kaew mangoes are smaller and have a more pronounced sweetness, differing in size and the characteristics of the fruit's use from the Keitt mango. # Conclusion: While all these mango varieties, including Keitt, share some common desirable attributes such as sweetness and low fiber content, there are distinct differences in shapes, flavors, colors, and uses that set them apart from each other. Keitt mangoes, with their large size and long shelf life, might be most similar to Chok Anan in terms of the minimal fiber and sweetness, but each mango variety has its own unique characteristics that appeal to different tastes and culinary uses."},{"prompt":"give me a good mysterious hacker username list for discord alt accounts","completion":"Creating a mysterious hacker username for your Discord alt accounts can add a fun and enigmatic layer to your online persona.

However, they differ slightly in their structure and, to some extent, in their usage. 1. **\\"Likely to be late\\"** is a more standard and formal way of expressing that it is probable someone will not arrive on time. This construction (likely + infinitive verb) is commonly used in both written and spoken English. - Example: She is likely to be late due to the heavy traffic. 2. **\\"Likely being late\\"** is less formal and might be less common in standard written English, but can still be heard in conversational speech. It suggests an ongoing situation where someone is in the process of being late. - Example: With the way the meeting is dragging on, he's likely being late for his next appointment. The choice between these phrases may depend on the context and degree of formality desired. However, \\"likely to be late\\" is generally the more universally accepted and understood form."},{"prompt":"Which one is more common?","completion":"\\"Likely to be late\\" is more common and widely accepted in both spoken and written English. It's a more standard form used to express the probability of someone or something not arriving on time. This structure (likely + to be + adjective/noun) follows conventional grammar rules and is preferred in formal contexts, but it's also used casually. The construction \\"likely being late\\" might be used in conversational speech, especially in dynamic contexts where the action of being late is ongoing. However, it's less formal and not as commonly found in written texts or formal speech. Overall, if you're unsure which to use, \\"likely to be late\\" is the safer and more universally appropriate choice."},{"prompt":"I want Mark to come to my party or coming to my party, which one is more common","completion":"\\"I want Mark to come to my party\\" is more common and grammatically standard.

Stick with \\"I want Mark to come to my party\\" for clarity and correctness."},{"prompt":"Роль екзотики в художніх творах Вольтера","completion":"Вольтер, французький філософ, письменник та представник Просвітництва XVIII століття, широко використовував екзотичні мотиви в своїх творах. Екзотика для Вольтера слугувала не просто яскравим тлом для розгортання дії, але й потужним інструментом для обговорення філософських, соціальних, політичних та релігійних питань свого часу. Одним з найвідоміших творів Вольтера, де екзотика відіграє ключову роль, є \\"Кандид, або Оптимізм\\". Ця сатирична повість розповідає про пригоди молодого чоловіка на ім'я Кандид, який подорожує світом, сповнений ілюзій про взірцевість і досконалість світу. Екзотичні локації, такі як Південна Америка та Ельдорадо, дозволяють Вольтеру критикувати європейські уявлення про варварство та цивілізованість, колоніалізм, а також представити утопічну картину суспільства, де панують рівноправність і благополуччя. В \\"Задіг або Доля\\", іншому відомому творі Вольтера, описується подорож головного героя, Задіга, персонажа зі Сходу, який шукає справедливість і істину. Через цю пригодницьку історію Вольтер використовує екзотичний пейзаж та елементи східного колориту для дослідження різних філософських ідеалів та соціальних порядків. Екзотика в творах Вольтера надає їм живописності та допомагає передати ідеї Просвітництва, такі як віра у прогрес, критика традиціоналізму й авторитаризму, та важливість особистого досвіду й спостереження для формування знань про світ. Екзотичні мотиви дозволяють читачам епохи Вольтера та його сучасникам обговорювати далекі та чужорідні країни, що іноді діяло як метафора для роздумів над своїми соціальними порядками, уявленнями про добро і зло, та ідеалами справедливості і свободи."},{"prompt":"Вольтер як критик В. Шекспіра: підхід Вольтера до засад побудови літературного твору.","completion":"Вольтер, видатний фігурант французького Просвітництва, відомий своїм критичним ставленням до Вільяма Шекспіра і його творчості. Попри те, що Вольтер визнавав геніальність Шекспіра як драматурга, він часто критикував його стиль, структуру творів і трактування деяких тем. 1. **Критика стилю та конвенцій**: Вольтер вважав, що Шекспір часто порушував правила класицизму, які були прийняті в літературі того часу, особливо во Франції. Він різко критикував Шекспіра за нехтування єдностями часу, місця та дії, які вважалися основоположними для гармонійної та вишуканої драми. 2. **Мішаний жанр**: Вольтер також не сприймав схильність Шекспіра до мішання жанрів у своїх п'єсах, де трагедія містить елементи комічного, лірічного чи навіть фарсу. Він вважав це порушенням літературної естетики та наголошував на важливості жанрової чистоти для досягнення артистичної довершеності. 3. **Натуралізм та грубість мови**: Вольтер часто звертав увагу на натуралізм у діалогах Шекспіра, який він розглядав як вираз грубості та низького стилю. Французький письменник віддавав перевагу більш вишуканому та інтелектуальному використанню мови у літературному творі. 4. **Використання історичних сюжетів**: Незважаючи на те, що Вольтер цінував історію як джерело натхнення для літератури, він критикував Шекспіра за неточне або фривольне використання історичних фактів у своїх п'єсах. Вольтер і Шекспір відбивали різні культурні та естетичні традиції своїх країн. Вольтер був палким прихильником класицизму з його прагненням до порядку, раціональності та естетичної витонченості. Водночас Шекспір, що належав до ренесансної Англії, мав більш вільний підхід до створення своїх драматичних творів, часто порушуючи класичні правила. Критичний погляд Вольтера на Шекспіра слід розглядати в контексті культурного та літературного контексту того періоду, де \\"правила мистецтва\\" відрізнялися залежно від національних та культурних особливостей."},{"prompt":"5. Вплив Вольтера на розвиток європейської літератури.","completion":"Вольтер, одна з найяскравіших фігур європейського Просвітництва XVIII століття, мав значний вплив на розвиток не тільки французької, але й європейської літератури загалом. Його роботи, ідеї та критичні міркування сприяли формуванню нових літературних напрямків, норм та цінностей. 1. **Пропагування ідей Просвітництва**: Вольтер не лише зводив критику на абсолютизм та релігійний фанатизм, але й широко пропагував ідеали свободи, толерантності та використання розуму як основи для особистої та суспільної моралі. Ці ідеї відіграли важливу роль в формуванні етичних та філософських основ європейської літератури. 2. **Розвиток літературної критики**: Вольтер виступав не тільки як письменник, але й як критик, зокрема критикуючи творчість інших авторів, наприклад В. Шекспіра. Він вважав, що критичний аналіз літературних творів є ключем до зрозуміння й оцінки їхньої справжньої цінності. Його підхід до критики сприяв розвитку аналітичних методів у літературознавстві. 3. **Вплив на жанрове розмаїття**: Вольтер експериментував з різними літературними формами, включаючи філософські оповідання (\\"Кандид, або Оптимізм\\"), трагедії (\\"Заїра\\"), історичні праці, сатиричні твори та есеї. Це сприяло розширенню жанрових меж та стимулювало пошук нових творчих форм у європейській літературі. 4. **Естетика та стиль**: Вольтер пропонував власну естетику, в якій він наголошував на ясності, простоті та витонченості виразу. Його підхід вплинув на стилістичні уподобання багатьох письменників і поетів, спонукаючи їх до більшої уваги до слова та його значення. 5. **Популяризація освіти та наукового пізнання**: Вольтер активно використовував літературу як засіб для поширення наукових знань та освіти, що сприяло розвитку науково-популярного жанру. Його роботи мотивували читачів цікавитися наукою та культурою, сприяючи формуванню освіченої публіки. Загалом, Вольтер відіграв ключову роль у розвитку модерної європейської літератури, зокрема завдяки своїй вмілій інтеграції філософських, політичних та естетичних ідей у художні форми. Його вплив поширювався через кордони Франції, надихаючи письменників по всій Європі."},{"prompt":"Ho bisogno di valutare quanto sia presente un'emozione all'interno di una frase.

In the game it is not stated why he is in the joint... but the manual says why he's here (yes, I made a manual, it's available on my website). He used to be a government agent, a hitman for the mob, never married and is now in prison. He managed to terrorize half the Aryan Brotherhood back in Texas and has been relocated to the East Coast because of some other reason, particularly involving a doctor. He is somewhat similar to Leo Kasper from Manhunt 2 in terms of personality except he does sometimes feels remorse for when accidentally killing a civilian and he feels apathetic towards the violence around him as he experienced.","completion":"Jason Kennedy sounds like a complex and intriguing character, offering a rich narrative potential for a horror game setting. His background as a convict with a tumultuous past, including being a government agent and a hitman for the mob, sets a dark and gripping tone that can deeply immerse players in his journey. The choice of keeping his reason for incarceration somewhat mysterious to players who only engage with the game, and revealing it through an external manual, is an interesting narrative technique that adds layers to his character and encourages players to engage with the game's world beyond the gameplay itself.

Considering the depth of Jason Kennedy's character and setting, you might explore the following elements further in your game development: 1. **Moral Choices**: Implement scenarios where Jason's decisions significantly impact the story and characters around him, reflecting his complex relationship with violence and morality. 2. **Flashbacks**: Use flashbacks or dream sequences to reveal more about Jason's past, including his time as a government agent and a hitman for the mob, adding depth to his character and potentially serving as gameplay segments that differ stylistically from the main prison setting. 3. **Relationship Dynamics**: Develop the relationships Jason has with other inmates, guards, and perhaps mysterious figures within the penitentiary. His history with the Aryan Brotherhood and his involvement with a particular doctor could lead to interesting alliances or enmities. 4. **Psychological Horror Elements**: Given Jason's past and his apathetic stance towards violence, incorporating psychological horror elements that blur the line between reality and his perceptions can intensify the horror experience, challenging the player's understanding of truth within the game. 5. **Redemption Arc**: Consider including a redemption arc for Jason, or at least the possibility of one depending on player choices. This could create a more compelling narrative, prompting players to invest more deeply in his journey towards redemption or further descent. 6. **Skill Set**: Given his background as a hitman and government agent, Jason likely has a unique set of skills that can be leveraged in gameplay mechanics, such as stealth, combat, and perhaps some form of tactical analysis or manipulation. Your commitment to creating a detailed backstory and personality for Jason Kennedy, along with the thoughtfully designed game world, sets a strong foundation for a captivating horror game. Balancing his dark past with the player's ability to navigate moral complexity and possibly seek redemption (or fully embrace the darkness) could result in a richly immersive and emotionally engaging experience."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Moisture content of mango peel is typically between 59-69%. If 60g of dried mango peel was used how much pectin would've been obtained?","completion":"To estimate the amount of pectin that would have been obtained from 60g of dried mango peel, we need to first understand the effective amount of mango peel substance (excluding water) in the fresh mango peel from which the 0.997g of pectin was extracted, and then use that percentage to calculate the expected yield from a completely dried sample. From the information, the moisture content of mango peel is typically between 59-69%. When considering pectin extraction from fresh mango peel, we need to adjust for this moisture content to compare it directly with a dried mango peel scenario. 1. **Find the Dry Weight of Fresh Peel**: Let's pick an average moisture content for our calculation. An average could be (59% + 69%) / 2 = 64%. This means, on average, 64% of the fresh mango peel weight is water. Therefore, the dry substance of the fresh mango peel would be 100% - 64% = 36%. 2. **Calculate Dry Weight from 60g Fresh Peel**: 36% of the 60g fresh mango peel is dry substance. (Dry~weight = 60g times 0.36 = 21.6g) 3. **Determine Pectin Yield Relative to Dry Weight**: Knowing that 0.997g of pectin was obtained from 21.6g of dry substance gives us a way to find out the yield based on the dry substance. Yield percentage based on dry weight = ( frac{0.997g}{21.6g} times 100% = 4.61%) 4. **Calculate Pectin from 60g Dry Peel**: Assuming now the 60g mango peel is entirely dry (no moisture), using the yield percentage obtained above, we can find out how much pectin would have been extracted. Pectin from 60g dry peel = (60g times 4.61% = 2.766g) Therefore, from 60g of completely dried mango peel, theoretically, you could expect to obtain approximately 2.766g of pectin, assuming all other conditions are constant and the efficiency of pectin extraction relative to the dry weight of the peel remains the same."},{"prompt":"Как восстановить пожелтевшие пло массу","completion":"Восстановить пожелтевшую пластмассу можно несколькими способами, в зависимости от типа пластмассы и степени её пожелтения. Ниже приведены некоторые популярные методы: 1. **Перекись водорода (H2O2) и УФ-освещение**: - Этот метод особенно хорош для восстановления пожелтевших пластиковых деталей электроники, например, компьютеров и игровых консолей. - Смешайте перекись водорода (обязательно более 10% концентрации) с небольшим количеством ксантановой камеди или любого другого загустителя, чтобы получить густую пасту. - Нанесите пасту на пожелтевшую поверхность и накройте прозрачной плёнкой (чтобы предотвратить испарение). - Поместите объект под прямые солнечные лучи или используйте ультрафиолетовую лампу для активации процесса. - После нескольких часов (иногда требуется до суток) смойте пасту. Пожелтение должно заметно уменьшиться или исчезнуть. 2. **Зубная паста или сода**: - Подходит для небольших предметов. - Нанесите зубную пасту или соду на мягкую ткань или зубную щетку. - Аккуратно потрите пожелтевшие участки. - Данный метод требует осторожности, чтобы не повредить поверхность. 3. **Белизна или хлорный отбеливатель**: - Данный метод следует использовать только в крайнем случае и с большой осторожностью, так как хлор может повредить пластмассу. - Разбавьте белизну водой (отношение примерно 1:1) и протрите пожелтевшие участки, используя защитные перчатки. - После нанесения раствора на короткое время, тщательно промойте предмет чистой водой. 4. **Профессиональные средства для очистки пластика**: - В магазинах хозяйственных товаров можно найти специализированные чистящие средства для пластика. - Они подходят для использования на большинстве видов пластиков и могут быть менее агрессивными, чем домашние методы. Помните о безопасности и всегда тестируйте выбранный метод на небольшом, менее заметном участке пластика, чтобы избежать повреждения. Если пластмассовый предмет имеет большую ценность или вы беспокоитесь, что можете его повредить, лучше обратиться к профессионалам."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[캬아, 그때 작은아버지가 울며불며 할아버지의 바짓가랑이를 잡고 늘어졌었지. 할아버지는 너 같은 아들을 둔 내 잘못도 있으니 내 몸 같은 기업 하나 날리는 셈 치고 준다며 건설 회사를 안겼는데….] “꾹아, 너 뉴스 보고 뭐라고 하는 거야?” 술이 살짝 올라 볼이 빨개진 여자가 나를 쳐다봤다. [니들은 죽었다 깨어나도 재벌의 세상은 모를 것이다. 이럴 땐 자는 척이나 해야겠다.] 나는 몇 번 눈을 끔뻑이다가 눈을 감았다. 졸리다는 신호였다. “꾹이, 졸린가 봐.” 여자는 나를 조심스레 안더니 원룸 구석의 내 자리에 살포시 놓았다. 그러고는 볼에 뽀뽀를 했다. “잘 자라, 우리 꾹이.” 여자는 내 배를 토닥토닥 두드렸다. “소영아, 근데 우리 꾹이 이제 엄마, 아빠 이런 말 할 때 되지 않았어?” “말이 좀 늦은 애들도 있대. 우리 꾹이도 그런 거 아닐까?” [말이 늦은 게 아니라 니들은 내 진짜 엄마, 아빠가 아니라서 안 부르는 거야. 니들은 그저 나, 전성국을 키워주는 대리모, 대리부일 뿐이야, 이것들아….] 어느새 잠이 스르르 오기 시작했다. 평생을 불면증에 시달렸는데, 요즘은 잠이 주기적으로 미친 듯이 쏟아져서 죽을 지경이었다. * * * 나는 뉴스 시간대가 되면 최선을 다해서 울어댔다. 여자는 내가 뉴스를 보면 울음을 그친다는 사실을 알고는 뉴스를 주기적으로 틀어줬다. 뉴스는 나에게 뽀통령과 같은 존재였다. 덕분에 나는 삼전 그룹이 현재 어떻게 돌아가고 있는지 적나라하게 알 수 있었다. 할아버지는 회귀 전처럼 2년 형을 선고받고 온갖 플래시를 받으며 감옥에 들어갔다. 그 틈을 기다리고 있었다는 듯이 작은아버지는 왕자의 난을 일으켰고 할아버지가 3개월 만에 특사로 풀려나면서 왕자의 난은 마무리됐다. 내가 기억하고 있는 회귀 전과 다른 것은 없었다. 비록 나는 가난한 집에 태어났지만, 회귀 전의 모든 경험과 지식은 그대로이고 미래까지 알고 있다. 내가 알고 있는 1992년 이후의 대한민국 미래가 바뀌지 않았다면 말이다. 더군다나 나는 이전 생보다 열 살이나 어렸다. 이런 집안이라도 잘만 버틴다면 다시 회귀 전에 누린 부와 명예를 누릴 수 있을 것 같았다. 나는 달콤한 상상에 빠져들었다. 이번 생에서도 재벌이 될 계획이다. 나의 발아래 고개 숙인 수많은 직원들. 대한민국의 경제가 내 손안에 움직이는 그때. 히죽히죽. “꾹아, 뭐가 그렇게 재미있어?” 여자가 설거지를 하다 말고 웃는 나를 뒤돌아봤다. 나는 뾰로통한 얼굴로 여자를 쳐다봤다. [IMF 때 돈 좀 불릴 거야. 그러니까 나 잘 키워. 나중에 키워준 은혜 정도는 갚을게.] 이 비루한 환경에서 나 같은 고귀한 존재를 키워준 것에 대한 적절한 보상은 할 생각이다. [집도 좀 사줘야 할 것 같고, 여자나 남자나 번듯한 자리 하나씩 주면 되겠지.] 나는 턱을 매만졌다. “성국아, 엄마랑 콩나물 사러 요 앞 슈퍼에 가자.” [난 뉴스 보고 있을게. 혼자 다녀와.] 하지만 여자는 나를 이미 포대기에 안고 있다. [여자! 나 혼자도 잘 있을 수 있다고!] 내가 바동거리자 여자가 엉덩이를 도닥였다. “이렇게 발버둥 치는 거 보면 성국이는 축구 선수 될 거야?” [무슨 말씀. 난 재벌이 장래 희망이래두.] “알았어, 알았어. 어서 가자.” 여자는 나를 업고는 문밖을 나섰다. 이때, 위층에서 누군가 내려오는 소리가 들렸다. “107호?” [뭐야, 감히 이름도 아니고 호수로 부르다니?] 나는 내려오는 여자를 쏘아봤다. 단발머리에 짙은 정장. 차가운 인상이었다. “어머, 이제 출근하세요?” 여자가 살갑게 묻자 단발머리가 고개를 끄덕였다. “오전에 일이 있어서 오늘은 좀 늦게 출근해요. 그럼, 난 길 건너서 버스 타야 해서요.” “잘 다녀오세요.” 여자는 허리를 반쯤 숙여 인사했다. [어이, 여자. 대체 저 여자가 누구인데, 허리까지 숙여 인사해?] “성국아, 뭘 그렇게 종알거려?” 여자가 내 엉덩이를 토닥거렸다. 이게 왜 이렇게 기분이 좋은 거지? 엉덩이 토닥거림 몇 번에 화도 풀리고 졸음도 슬슬 밀려왔다. “성국아, 자는 거야?” [말…시키….] 나는 얼핏 잠에 빠져들었다. 슈퍼에서 콩나물 100원치를 사면서 좀 더 달라는 여자의 소리가 들렸다. 겨우 100원에 벌벌 떨다니. 나는 100원이라는 동전을 써본 기억도 없었다. 슈퍼를 나선 여자는 잠에 취해 있는 내 엉덩이를 연신 도닥이며 집으로 걸어갔다. “성국아, 오늘 저녁에는 맛있는 콩나물국 끓여줄게.” [그건 니들이 먹는 거지. 내가 먹는 건 분유잖아.] 나는 잠결에 중얼거렸다. “우리 성국이는 진짜 엄마 말 다 알아듣는 것 같아. 엄마가 성국이 막 낳고는 혼자 집에서 너무 외로웠는데, 이제 성국이가 이렇게 종알거리고. 얼마나 좋은지 몰라.” 여자는 많이 외로웠나 보다. 산후우울증인가, 그런 게 있다더니 그런 모양이었다. 여자는 내 엉덩이를 연신 두들겼다. 또! 또! 또! 겨우 이런 거에 또 기분 포근해지면 안 되는데. 쿠우웅! 뭐지? 이때, 잠이 번쩍 깨는 요란한 소리가 들렸다. “으아아악!” “어서 피해요!” “으아악!” 동시에 사람들의 비명 소리가 연이어 들렸다. [도대체 뭐지?] 여자는 업은 나를 재빨리 안아 들고 다급히 뛰기 시작했다. [도대체 무슨 일이냐고!] 그때였다. 길옆 건물이 우르르 무너졌다. 동시에 내 시야가 뿌옇게 변했다. 여자는 나를 꼭 끌어안았다. 나는 숨이 막힐 것 같았고, 눈앞은 시커멓게 변했다. 이번 생은 이렇게 죽는 건가. [그래, 가난한 집에 태어났으니 일찌감치 죽는 것도 나쁘지 않은데…. 다음 생이 없으면! 그러면 안 되는데….] 나는 여자를 얼른 잡고 흔들었다. [여자, 정신 차려! 여자, 죽으면 안 돼! 나 커서 재벌 돼야 한다고!] 그때였다. 숨이 넘어갈 듯한 여자의 간절한 목소리가 들렸다. “성국아… 엄마가 지켜줄게.” 뭐지? 왜 가슴이 뜨뜻해지는 거지…. 여자의 머리 위로 거대한 벽돌 하나가 낙하하고 있었다. [안 돼!] 나는 온몸을 바동거리며 소리를 질렀고, 여자는 나를 온몸으로 감싸 안았다. “성국아… 엄마가 지켜줄.” 여자는 채 말을 다 끝내지도 못했다. 순간 내 입에서 한마디가 불쑥 튀어나왔다. “엄. 마!” 그 소리를 듣자마자 여자는 미소를 지었다. “그래, 꾹아. 엄마야….” 여자의 눈이 스르르 감겼다. 나는 그때부터 세상 사람 다 들리게 소리쳐 울기 시작했다. “으아앙! 으아앙! 으아앙!” 엄마를 살리기 위한 몸부림이었다. [엄마! 죽지 마! 도와주세요! 우리 엄마가 죽는다고요!] * * * 그릉. 그릉. 그릉. 나는 너무 많이 울어서 숨을 힘겹게 뱉어냈다. 눈은 이미 퉁퉁 부어서 감았다 뜰 때마다 쓰리기까지 했다. 이런 나를 안고 1시간째 병원 복도를 오가는 건 남자였다. 아니, 아빠였다. 여자에게 엄마라고 부른 순간 나의 마지막 방지턱은 순식간에 무너지고 말았다. 슈퍼를 나오는 길, 다세대주택이 철거 작업 중에 무너졌다. 그 바람에 길을 걸어가던 수많은 사람들이 다쳤다. 엄마도 길을 걸어가던 그 많은 사람들 중 한 명이었다. 그중 나만 유일하게 아무 상처도 입지 않았다. 엄마 품에 꼭 안긴 채였기 때문이다. 결국, 나는 엄마 덕분에 살았다. “크으응!” 나는 콧물을 다시 주르륵 들이켰다. 아빠라는 남자는 나를 달랬다. “꾹아, 괜찮아. 다행히 엄마도 괜찮대.” 눈두덩이 잔뜩 부은 채 나를 안아 달래는 아빠의 얼굴을 쳐다봤다. 아빠는 울음을 겨우 참으면서 나를 안아 달래고 있었다. 일하는 식당의 앞치마를 벗지도 못한 채였다. 이제 이들은 나에게 엄마이고 아빠였다. 엄마는 나를 구하기 위해 몸을 날리고, 아빠는 우는 날 달래느라 온종일 서서 일하고 와서도 병원 복도를 걷고 또 걸었다. 그러면서도 싫은 말 한 마디 안 하고, 포근하게 나를 감싸 안은 채 내가 놀랐을까 봐 걱정만 잔뜩 하는 이들. “꾹아, 괜찮아. 엄마도 다 괜찮대. 하늘이 정말 도왔나 봐. 의사 샘이 며칠 푹 쉬면 될 거래.” [그건 나도 안다고. 근데 그냥 계속 눈물이 난다고….] 나는 옹알거렸다. 아마 회귀 전에 나를 모시던 양 비서가 이런 내 모습을 본다면 기겁해서 도망갈 게 뻔했다. 할아버지가 돌아가시기 전에 이런 말을 남기셨다. - 기업의 총수는 웃는 것도 우는 것도 때와 장소를 가려야 한단다, 성국아. 그래서 나는 나를 귀여워해 주던 할아버지의 장례식장에서도 울지 않았다. 감정을 드러내는 일은 곧 회사의 주가에 영향을 미쳤기 때문이다. “엄마 보러갈까?” “우우우!” 나는 격하게 대답했다. 토닥토닥. 남자는 내 등을 두드리며 엄마가 누워 있는 병실의 문을 열었다. 엄마의 가녀린 팔에는 링거가 꽂혀 있었다. 머리에는 붕대가 칭칭 감겨 있었지만, 의사 말로는 피부가 찢어져서 그런 거지 다른 이상은 없다고 했다. 엄마가 나를 보자 미소를 지었다. 아빠는 나를 들어 엄마 품에 안겨줬다. 엄마가 나를 다시 꼭 안았다. “꾹아, 엄마 다시는 우리 꾹이 못 보는 줄 알았어. 그래두 우리 꾹이가 안 다쳐서 정말 다행이야.” [바보, 엄마는 머리가 찢어졌다구!] 내가 바동거리자 엄마는 나를 더 세게 안았다. “소영아, 오늘 밤에는 내가 꾹이 볼 테니까 오늘은 병원에서 푹 쉬어.” “자기야, 나 퇴원할래. 병원비 많이 나오잖아.” “다른 데 크게 이상 없지만, 그래도 모르니까 의사 선생님이 하루는 병원에 있으라고 했어.” “자기야, 그래도….” “소영아, 내 말 들어. 돈보다 네 건강이 더 우선이야. 네가 건강해야 꾹이도 잘 키우지. 안 그래?” “…알았어.” 엄마는 마지못해 대답했다. “참, 자기야. 집주인 아가씨가 나 발견했는데. 어디 가셨어?” “나 오자마자 출근해야 한다며 가셨어. 그동안 꾹이 검사도 다 받아주시고, 얼마나 고마운지 몰라.” 단발머리는 맞은편 버스 정류장에서 버스를 기다리다 건물이 무너지자 달려와서 재빨리 나와 엄마를 병원으로 옮겼다. 경황이 없어 나도 잘 기억이 안 나지만, 덕분에 누구보다 빨리 병원에 도착했다. “자기가 먼저 보면 인사드려. 난 병원 나가면 따로 인사드릴게.” “지금은 아무 걱정 하지 말고 쉬어. 성국이는 내가 잘 돌볼 테니까.” 아빠는 나를 안고는 병원을 나섰다. * * * 밤공기가 시원했다. 아빠는 나를 달래며 계속 걸었다. “꾹아, 오늘은 좀 걷자. 아빠가 아직 스물세 살이라 다리는 튼튼해.” [돈 없단 소리구나.] “엄마랑 너랑 무사해서 정말 다행이야. 아빠가 다 미안해. 그 건물주가 병원비랑 다 물고, 건물도 다시 튼튼하게 짓는대. 아빠가 잘 감시할게.” [부실시공은 정말 안 된다고!] “우리 꾹이랑 말하면 꼭 대화하는 것 같다니까. 꾹아, 오늘은 아빠랑 남자끼리 진한 밤을 보내자.” [하아. 그건 사양할게.] 나는 고개를 도리도리 흔들었다. “우리 성국이는 진짜 아빠 얘기 다 알아듣는 거지?” [당연하지.] 아빠는 그제야 퉁퉁 부은 얼굴로 웃었다. 다치고도 병원비 걱정에 전전긍긍하는 엄마. 차비를 아끼려고 이 밤에 돌이 다 된 아들을 안고 걸어가는 아빠. 그런데 이 모든 게 이상하게 기분 좋았다. 스물세 살의 돈 없는 아빠가 나를 아기 띠에 매고는 터덜터덜 걸어가는 이 늦여름의 밤. 나는 이 밤을 오랫동안 기억할 것만 같았다.","completion":"Episode 2 Jeon Taeguk. My younger brother, two years my junior. Jeon Taeguk, who inherited only the enthusiastic genes of our parents, was sent off to the United States for early education as soon as he became a middle school student. Even there, after devouring all sorts of drugs, including marijuana and various new types of drugs, he returned to Korea and continued the same behavior. He was a troublemaker who was cleanly ousted from the succession structure of the Samjeon Group after being put in charge of one of its subsidiaries and causing a car accident under the influence of drugs. His eyes, cruelly slit, seemed no different from before my regression. I quickly followed Jeon Taeguk. My father and uncle stood with somber faces. During the three months my grandfather was in prison, a so-called \\"Prince's Rebellion\\" occurred. My ambitious uncle, whose ambition was unnecessarily greater than his capacity, tried to persuade the shareholders to strip my father of his management rights. However, everything failed, and the Prince's Rebellion ended with my uncle taking over the least profitable construction sector of the Samjeon Group. [Ah, I remember how my uncle was clinging to my grandfather's legs, crying and begging. My grandfather said it was also his fault for having a son like him, so he considered it as throwing away a company like his own body and handed over the construction company...] \\"Kkuk, what are you saying after watching the news?\\" A woman with slightly flushed cheeks from alcohol looked at me. [You'll never understand the world of chaebols even if you're reborn. I should pretend to be asleep at times like this.] I blinked a few times and then closed my eyes, signaling I was sleepy. \\"Kkuk seems sleepy.\\" The woman carefully held me and gently placed me in my spot in the corner of the studio apartment. Then, she kissed me on the cheek. \\"Sleep well, my Kkuk.\\" The woman patted my stomach. \\"Soyoung, isn't it time for Kkuk to start saying words like mom and dad?\\" \\"Some kids are just late talkers. Maybe Kkuk is like that?\\" [It's not that I'm a late talker; it's because you're not my real mom and dad. You're just surrogates raising me, Jeon Seongguk....] Soon, sleep began to take over me. I had suffered from insomnia all my life, but these days, sleep poured over me periodically like madness, to the point of death. * * * I cried my best whenever it was time for the news. The woman knew that I would stop crying if she turned on the news, so she started to turn it on regularly. The news was like President Po to me. Thanks to that, I was starkly aware of the current state of the Samjeon Group. Just like before my regression, my grandfather was sentenced to two years in prison and entered jail amidst all the flashes. Waiting for this moment, my uncle started the Prince's Rebellion, and it ended when my grandfather was released on a special pardon after three months. Nothing was different from what I remembered before my regression. Although I was born into a poor family, all the experiences and knowledge from before my regression remained the same, and I knew the future. If the future of South Korea after 1992 hasn't changed. Moreover, I was ten years younger than in my previous life. Even in this family, if I endure well, it seemed like I could enjoy the wealth and honor I had before my regression. I indulged in sweet imaginations. I planned to become a chaebol in this life too. Countless employees bowing under my feet. The time when the economy of South Korea moved in my hands. Grinning. \\"Kkuk, what's so funny?\\" The woman, who was doing the dishes, turned around and smiled at me. I looked at her with a pouty face. [I'll make some money during the IMF crisis. So, raise me well. I'll repay you for your kindness later.] I intended to properly reward them for raising such a noble being like me in this miserable environment. [I guess I should buy them a house, and give them a decent position, whether it's for a man or a woman.] I stroked my chin. \\"Seongguk, let's go buy some bean sprouts at the supermarket nearby.\\" [I'll watch the news. Go by yourself.] But the woman already had me in a baby carrier. [Hey! I can stay by myself!] As I squirmed, the woman patted my bottom. \\"Is Seongguk going to be a soccer player, seeing how he's kicking?\\" [What are you talking about? My dream is to become a chaebol.] \\"Alright, alright. Let's go.\\" The woman carried me out the door. Then, someone from upstairs came down. \\"107?\\" [What, calling by the room number instead of the name?] I glared at the woman coming down. Short hair, dark suit. She had a cold impression. \\"Oh, are you going to work now?\\" The woman asked warmly, and the short-haired woman nodded. \\"I have work in the morning, so I'm going to work late today. Then, I have to cross the street to catch the bus.\\" \\"Have a good day.\\" The woman bowed halfway in greeting. [Hey, woman. Who is she that you're bowing down to greet?] \\"Seongguk, what are you babbling about?\\" The woman patted my bottom. Why does this feel so good? A few pats on the bottom, and not only did my anger dissipate, but sleepiness also crept in. \\"Seongguk, are you sleeping?\\" [Talk...ing....] I briefly fell asleep. I heard the woman's voice bargaining for a little more while buying 100 won worth of bean sprouts at the supermarket. Trembling over just 100 won. I couldn't even remember using a 100 won coin. Leaving the supermarket, the woman continuously patted my bottom, now drowsy from sleep, as she walked home. \\"Seongguk, I'll make you a delicious bean sprout soup tonight.\\" [That's for you to eat. I drink formula.] I mumbled in my sleep. \\"Our Seongguk seems to understand everything mom says. I was so lonely at home alone after giving birth to Seongguk, but now that Seongguk babbles like this, you don't know how happy I am.\\" The woman must have been very lonely. Maybe it was postpartum depression, something like that. The woman kept patting my bottom. Again! Again! Again! I shouldn't feel so cozy from just this. Kooong! What's that? Then, a loud noise woke me up. \\"Aaaah!\\" \\"Get out of the way!\\" \\"Aaaah!\\" Simultaneously, the screams of people followed. [What's going on?] The woman, holding me, quickly picked me up and started running frantically. [What's happening?!] That's when it happened. A building next to the road collapsed. At the same time, my vision turned white. The woman hugged me tightly. I felt like I was suffocating, and everything in front of me turned pitch black. Is this how I die in this life? [Well, being born into a poor family, dying early isn't so bad... unless there's no next life! That can't happen...] I quickly grabbed and shook the woman. [Woman, wake up! You can't die! I have to grow up and become a chaebol!] That's when it happened. The woman's desperate voice, as if she was running out of breath, reached me. \\"Seongguk... Mom will protect you.\\" What? Why does my heart feel warm... A huge brick was falling towards the woman's head. [No!] I screamed and squirmed with all my might, and the woman hugged me with her whole body. \\"Seongguk... Mom will protect.\\" The woman couldn't even finish her sentence. Suddenly, a word burst out of my mouth. \\"Mom!\\" Hearing that, the woman smiled. \\"Yes, Kkuk. It's mom...\\" The woman's eyes slowly closed. From that moment, I started crying out loud enough for the whole world to hear. \\"Aaaah! Aaaah! Aaaah!\\" It was a struggle to save my mom. [Mom! Don't die! Someone help! My mom is dying!] * * * Grrr. Grrr. Grrr. I breathed heavily after crying too much. My eyes were so swollen that it hurt to open and close them. A man, no, a dad, who had been holding me and walking around the hospital corridor for an hour, was comforting me. The moment I called the woman mom, my last barrier crumbled instantly. On the way out of the supermarket, a multi-family house collapsed during demolition work. Many people walking on the street were injured because of it. Mom was one of those many people walking on the street. Among them, I was the only one who wasn't hurt at all. Because I was tightly held in mom's arms. Ultimately, I survived thanks to mom. \\"Krrrgh!\\" I sniffled and inhaled my runny nose again. The man, my dad, comforted me. \\"Kkuk, it's okay. Fortunately, mom is also okay.\\" Looking at dad's face, swollen from crying and comforting me, he was holding back tears. He hadn't even taken off the apron from the restaurant where he worked. Now, these people were my mom and dad to me. Mom threw herself to save me, and dad, after working all day standing, walked the hospital corridors all day to comfort me, crying. All the while, without a single word of complaint, warmly holding me, worried I might be startled. \\"Kkuk, shall we go see mom?\\" \\"Woo woo!\\" I answered vehemently. Pat pat. The man patted my back and opened the door to the room where mom was lying. Mom's slender arm had an IV hooked up. Her head was wrapped in bandages, but according to the doctor, it was just because the skin was torn, and there was nothing else wrong. Mom smiled when she saw me. Dad lifted me and placed me in mom's arms. Mom hugged me again tightly. \\"Kkuk, mom thought she would never see our Kkuk again. But it's really fortunate that Kkuk wasn't hurt.\\" [Idiot, mom's head is torn!] As I squirmed, mom hugged me even tighter. \\"Soyoung, I'll watch Kkuk tonight, so you rest in the hospital today.\\" \\"Honey, I want to be discharged. Hospital bills are expensive.\\" \\"There's nothing seriously wrong elsewhere, but the doctor said to stay in the hospital for a day.\\" \\"Honey, still...\\" \\"Soyoung, listen to me. Your health is more important than money. You need to be healthy to raise Kkuk properly, right?\\" \\"...Okay.\\" Mom reluctantly agreed. \\"By the way, honey. The lady landlord found me. Where did she go?\\" \\"She had to go to work as soon as I arrived. She was so grateful for taking care of Kkuk and getting all the tests done while I was gone.\\" The short-haired woman was waiting for the bus at the bus stop across the street when the building collapsed. She ran over quickly and moved me and mom to the hospital. I don't remember well because I was in a daze, but thanks to her, we arrived at the hospital faster than anyone else. \\"Tell her thank you when you see her first. I'll personally thank her when I'm discharged from the hospital.\\" \\"Don't worry about anything now and rest. I'll take good care of Seongguk.\\" Dad took me and left the hospital. * * * The night air was cool. Dad kept walking, comforting me. \\"Kkuk, let's walk a bit today. Dad is only twenty-three years old, so my legs are strong.\\" [That means we're short on money.] \\"Fortunately, both you and mom are safe. Dad feels so sorry. The building owner will cover the hospital bills and rebuild the building sturdily. Dad will keep an eye on it.\\" [Shoddy construction is really not okay!] \\"It feels like I'm really talking to our Kkuk. Kkuk, let's spend a deep night together, just the men.\\" [Sigh. I'll pass on that.] I shook my head back and forth. \\"Our Seongguk really understands everything dad says, right?\\" [Of course.] Dad finally smiled with his swollen face. Worrying about hospital bills even after getting hurt. Walking with his son turned into a stone in his arms to save on bus fare at night. But strangely, all of this felt good. A twenty-three-year-old dad without money, carrying me in a baby carrier, walking on this late summer night. I felt like I would remember this night for a long time."},{"prompt":"제4화 돌상에서 만 원을 움켜쥔 지도 언 열흘이 지났지만, 나의 인생은 달라지지 않았다. 눈 뜨면 먹고, 먹으면 또 자고, 그러면 당연히 배출을 하고 또 먹었다. 다리에는 힘이 좀 생겨서 선반을 잡고 걷는 것쯤은 쉽게 해냈지만, 아직 말은 미숙했다. 몇 년이나 이렇게 무기력하게 살아야 돈을 벌 수 있는 걸까. 나는 젖병을 문 채 뒹굴며 생각에 잠겼다. [어떻게 돈을 벌지?] 매일 나오는 뉴스의 경제 꼭지는 하나도 놓치지 않고 보고 있었다. 미래는 바뀌지 않을 모양이었다. 내가 기억하고 있는 1992년과 다른 게 없었다. [그렇다면 이제 돈을 벌려면 시드머니가 필요한데….] 삼전 그룹의 창업주이신 할아버지도 시골집에서 소 판 돈으로 시작하셨다. 띵동. 초인종이 울렸다. 엄마는 허리를 잡고 일어서더니 인터폰 화면을 쳐다봤다. 그러고는 후다닥 달려가서 현관문을 열었다. “언니!” 엄마가 언니라고 부르는 유일한 사람은 바로 집주인 단발머리였다. 단발머리는 오늘따라 세련된 느낌의 슈트를 입고 있었다. “성국이 엄마, 집에서 놀죠?” 여전한 돌직구. “아기 때문에요. 성국이 크면 저도 일하려고요.” 단발머리가 엄마에게 브로셔 몇 장을 내밀었다. “그럼, 이거 한번 신청해 봐요.” “이게 뭔데요?” “우리 회사에서 광고에 나올 아기 모델 구하는 거예요. 내가 일하는 회사니까 한번 지원해 봐요.” “언니, 광고 회사 다니세요?” “자세한 건 알 것 없고요. 사진 얼른 인화해서 참가서 작성해서 모레까지 나 줘요.” 광고 모델이라고? 나는 정신이 번쩍 들었다. 본능적으로 이 일이 돈이 될 것이라는 느낌이 왔다. 젖병 물고 기어 다니는 내가 유일하게 할 수 있는 일이었다. 다행히 돈을 향한 나의 천부적인 감각은 이번 생에서도 괜찮아 보였다. 단발머리가 내 얼굴을 이리저리 뜯어봤다. “화면 잘 받을 얼굴이에요. 한번 도전해봐요. 밑져야 본전이잖아요. 찢어지게 가난한 집구석에서 달리 돈 벌 일도 없어 보이는데.” [내 말이!] 이 찢어지게 가난한 집구석을 탈피하기 위해서는 어떻게든 시드머니를 모아야 했다. 나의 목표는 이제 1억이다. 원래 1억 모으기가 힘들지, 그다음은 돈이 돈을 버는 게 자본주의의 순리이다. IMF가 얼마 안 남았다고! 시드머니만 모으면 내가 가진 모든 지식을 총동원해서 이 가난한 집안을 일으켜 세울 수 있다. 엄마는 고개를 갸웃했다. “저희야 성국이가 세상에서 제일 이쁘지만… 다른 사람도 그렇게 생각할까요? 아직 성국이가 너무 어리기도 하고요.” [이게 뭔 소리야? 나 맨날 거울 보는데. 이 정도 얼굴 흔치 않아!] 나는 최대한 화난 투로 옹알거렸지만, 엄마의 표정은 굳어 있었다. “나는 신경 써준 건데, 싫다면 어쩔 수 없지.” 단발머리가 블러셔를 낚아채려는 순간, 나는 다시 한번 큰 소리로 옹알이를 했다. “으응. 으으응. 으어엉.” 번역하자면 이런 말이었다. [엄마, 이건 다시없을 기회야!] 그제야 엄마가 나를 내려다봤다. “우리 성국이, 하고 싶어?” 끄덕끄덕. 나는 단호하게 두 번이나 고개를 끄덕였다. 돌이 갓 지난 아이의 머리 무게를 생각지 못하고 너무 목에 힘을 줘서 끄덕이는 바람에 하마터면 바닥에 헤딩할 뻔한 것을 겨우 견뎠다. 단발머리가 눈치 빠르게 내 신호를 캐치했다. “한번 해봐요. 아기들 얼굴로도 뽑지만, 우선 촬영할 때 잘 안 울고 말귀 잘 알아듣는 애들 좋아하거든요. 성국이 똘똘해 보이니까, 한번 테스트해 봐요.” “그럴까요.” 엄마는 여전히 걱정스러운 얼굴이었다. 나는 배가 볼록하게 나온 엄마의 치마를 격하게 잡아당겼다. [엄마, 나만 믿어!] * * * 끼익-. 버스가 도착한 곳은 이태원이었다. 엄마는 나를 안고 힘겹게 버스에서 내렸다. 아빠가 임신한 엄마에게 택시 타라며 만 원짜리를 쥐여줬지만, 엄마는 버스를 탔다. 그 바람에 나는 난생처음 버스를 탔다. 그리고 서민들의 발이 되어준다는 버스의 덜컹거림 때문에 멀미를 심하게 했다. 이미 속은 난장판이었다. [이렇게 컨디션이 별로면 오디션 때 힘든데….] 나는 마른침을 꾸역꾸역 삼키며 엄마에게 안겨서 이태원의 한 건물에 들어갔다. 엄마는 로비에서 숨을 몇 번 삼킨 뒤에 안내 데스크로 향했다. “저… 오늘 아기 오디션 어디서 보나요?” “3층 회의실입니다. 오른쪽으로 가셔서 엘리베이터 타시면 돼요.” “감사합니다.” 엄마는 내 손을 꼭 쥐고는 엘리베이터로 향했다. 단발머리에게 건넨 일회용 카메라로 찍은 사진만으로 나는 서류 전형을 가뿐히 통과했다. 서류에서 통과된 단 열 명의 아이들만이 오늘 오디션을 본다. 띵. 엘리베이터가 멈춰 서는 소리가 들렸다. 곧 문이 열리자 엄마는 엘리베이터에 올라탔다. 엘리베이터 안에는 오늘 나와 경쟁자로 보이는 아이와 부모가 있었다. 아빠와 가끔 데이트를 하러 갈 때 입는 엄마의 블랙 롱 원피스가 초라해질 정도로 엘리베이터에 타고 있는 여자는 명품 원피스에 핸드백을 들고 있었다. 내 또래로 보이는 아이를 안고 있는 사람은 중년의 여자였다. 보모인 모양이었다. 명품 백을 든 여자는 나와 엄마를 차갑게 쳐다보고는 3층에 엘리베이터가 서자마자 먼저 서둘러서 내렸다. 마치 이 엘리베이터 안에 세균이라도 퍼진 듯한 불쾌한 얼굴이었다. 회귀 전, 나 역시 저런 얼굴로 다른 사람을 봤다. 일반 직원이랑 엘리베이터를 같이 타는 것도 싫어서 삼전 그룹 내에는 내 전용 엘리베이터도 있었다. 그게 내 처지가 되다니…. 나는 조금 시무룩해졌다. 엄마가 내 엉덩이를 도닥였다. “성국아, 졸면 안 돼.” [졸린 거 아니야. 마음이 무거워서 그래.] “성국아, 우리 이거 끝나고 아빠가 택시 타라고 준 돈으로 맛있는 거 먹자. 치킨 먹을까?” [그건 엄마가 먹고 싶은 거지. 난 아직 이가 성치 못해서 치킨 못 뜯는다고.] “성국이는 엄마가 바나나 사줄게.” [그래, 바나나. 기운 차려주지, 뭐.] 엄마는 오디션 장소라고 적힌 표시를 따라 큰 회의실에 들어갔다. * * * 열 명의 엄마들이 아이를 안고 파마머리를 한 조연출의 안내를 들었다. “우선 감독님이 카메라 테스트 할 거예요. 카메라 테스트를 통과한 두 명에서 세 명 정도만 최종 테스트에 오를 겁니다. 그럼, 제가 호명하면 오셔서 카메라 테스트 진행할게요.” “네.” 다른 엄마들은 살짝 긴장이 섞인 흥분된 어조로 대답했다. 그 사이에서 엄마만 조금 기운이 없어 보였다. 엄마는 옆에 앉은 다른 아이들의 행색을 보고 있었다. 적어도 나처럼 거의 내복과 다름없는 외출복을 입은 아이는 단 한 명도 없었다. 모두들 한껏 멋을 부린 것이 유치할 정도였다. 나는 엄마를 잡아당겼다. 그리고 환하게 웃었다. [엄마, 겉모습은 중요한 게 아니야. 내 얼굴이 백만 불짜리잖아.] 엄마도 겨우 기운을 차리고 미소를 지었다. “성국아, 우리 잘하자.” [나는 당연히 잘하지.] 몇 명의 아이들이 들어가고 드디어 내 차례가 왔다. 눈부신 조명과 반사판. 그리고 내 앞으로 카메라가 보였다. 카메라는 나에게 꽤 익숙한 매체였다. 삼전 그룹의 장남으로 살면서 원하든 원치 않든 카메라 앞에 설 일은 수없이 많았다. 때문에 삼전 그룹 내에는 내 전용 카메라 테스트 팀과 인터뷰 대처 팀도 있었다. 공항에서 나올 때, 공장이나 회사 건물 시찰을 할 때, 대통령과 만나 악수를 할 때, 혹은 안 좋은 일로 법원에 오갈 때를 모두 대비했다. 어느 얼굴 각도에서 카메라가 더 잘 받고, 어느 컬러가 더 잘 어울리는지. 심지어 중요한 날 이전에는 피부과 시술도 받았다. 나는 눈부신 조명 아래에서 회귀 전 나에게 쏟아지던 카메라 플래시를 떠올렸다. “성국이라고?” 카메라 뒤에서 화면을 보고 있는 산도둑처럼 생긴 감독이 나를 빤히 쳐다봤다. “전성국?” [감독, 왜 자꾸 불러?] 나는 즉시 감독을 쳐다봤다. “성국이 몇 살이지?” “14개월이에요, 감독님.” 엄마가 얼른 대답했다. 감독은 내게 다시 눈길을 돌렸다. “자, 성국아. 이제부터 카메라가 널 찍을 거야. 너무 놀라지 말고 제발 이번에는 다른 애들처럼 울지 좀 말아라. 제발 부탁한다. 내가 오늘 아주 고막이 너덜너덜해.” 끄덕끄덕. 나는 알아들었다는 듯이 히죽거리며 머리를 끄덕였다. “쟤, 내 말 알아듣는 거 같네.” “여태까지 본 애 중에 말귀는 제일 잘 알아듣는 것 같아요, 감독님.” 옆에서 내 머리를 만져준 여자 스태프도 동의했다. “그냥 한 말이지. 애가 무슨 말을 알아듣겠어. 자, 카메라 테스트 시작하자고.” 감독의 말이 끝나자마자 카메라가 나를 찍기 시작했다. 사진 촬영이 아니라 영상이라 셔터 소리는 없었지만, 조명은 꽤나 세게 들어왔다. 나는 카메라를 보면서 미소, 폭소, 새침함을 마음껏 표현했다. 때로는 다른 곳을 보면서 아이처럼 뒹굴기도 했다. 얼마 전 습득한 잼잼과 도리도리도 간간이 포즈에 섞었다. 카메라 테스트를 위해서 나도 나름 집 안의 거울을 보면서 연습한 결과였다. 구석에 선 엄마가 감격에 겨운 얼굴로 나를 보고 있었다. [아직 감동하기에는 이르다고.] 나는 얼른 자세까지 틀어서 고개를 살짝 뒤로 돌려 윙크를 날렸다. 찡긋! 동시에 박수가 터졌다. 감독이 흐뭇한 미소를 지으며 손을 들었다. “그만! 더 찍을 필요도 없겠어. 얘는 무조건 최종이야. 합격!” 씨익. 나는 오른쪽 입꼬리를 슬쩍 올렸다. [이 정도야.] * * * 최종 오디션에는 나와 명품 백을 든 여자의 아들이 올랐다. 분명 얘보다 귀엽게 생긴 녀석들이 많았는데, 이 녀석이 올라온 건 의외였다. 나는 경쟁자를 예리하게 살폈다. 경쟁에 이기기 위해서는 적을 먼저 분석하는 게 최우선이었다. 그런데 같이 올라온 이 녀석은 눈이 동그란 것 외에는 별다른 특징이 없는 아기였다. 엄마는 내 옆에 앉아서 다리를 살짝 떨고 있었다. 긴장한 기색이 역력했다. “성국아, 긴장하지 마.” [긴장은 엄마나 하지 마.] “성국이 많이 긴장되는구나. 근데 엄마가 화장실이 너무 급한데….” 엄마의 말이 끝나자마자 명품 백을 든 여자가 아기를 안은 중년의 여자에게 눈짓했다. 그러자 중년의 여자가 엄마에게 말을 걸었다. “애는 내가 봐줄게요. 화장실 다녀오세요.” “정말요?” “그럼요.” “감사합니다.” 엄마는 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 엄마 화장실 얼른 다녀올 테니 아주머니 말 잘 듣고 있어.” “응.” 나는 고개를 끄덕거렸다. 임신을 하면 화장실에 자주 가고 싶다는데, 엄마는 나를 위해서 여태까지 화장실도 못 가고 참고 있었던 모양이다. 엄마는 얼른 자리에서 일어나 대기실 밖으로 나갔다. 중년의 여자가 나를 흘깃 보더니 중얼거렸다. “애가 참 이쁘네.” “뭐라고요?” 명품 백을 든 여자가 앙칼진 목소리로 물었다. “아니에요, 사모님. 그냥 한 소리예요.” “이쁘면 저 집 애나 키우세요.” “죄송합니다, 사모님.” “말 좀 가려서 해요. 애도 다 들어요. 무식해서 정말.” [무식한 건 누군지 모르겠네. 쯧쯧.] 나는 속으로 혀를 끌끌 찼다. 달칵. 대기실의 문이 열리더니 파마머리의 조연출이 들어왔다. 그리고 익숙하게 명품 백을 든 여자에게 고개를 숙였다. “사모님, 아기 연습 많이 시키셨죠?” [잠깐, 지금 이 상황은 뭐지? 저 여자는 미리 최종 대본 오디션 내용을 알고 있단 거잖아.] 명품 백을 든 여자는 고개를 까닥했다. “우리 애 어릴 적 추억 만들어 주려고 하는 건데, 왜 이렇게 힘들어? 이런 애랑 우리 애가 경쟁해야 하는 거야?” [이런 애? 그건 나를 일컫는 건가. 나 전성국을?] 뒷골이 슬슬 당겨왔다. 나는 순식간에 모든 상황이 이해됐다. 이미 모델은 내정된 상태이고, 오디션은 요식행위일 뿐이었다. 더군다나 엄마에게 화장실 가라고 순순히 나를 봐준 것도 조연출과 입을 맞출 시간을 갖기 위해서였다. “사모님, 조금만 참으세요. 감독님이 눈치채면 곤란해서요.” “감독은 우리 집안 몰라?” “감독님은 그러시는 분이 아니에요. 그래서 윗분들도 최종까지는 감독님은 절대 모르게 하라고 하셨어요. 오늘 얘는 처음 하는 거니까, 아마 못할 거예요. 아빠 연습 많이 시키셨죠?” “딕션 따로 봐주는 선생도 붙였어. 걱정 마.” 이때, 복도에서 엄마의 발걸음 소리가 들렸다. 엄마가 문을 열고 들어서자 조연출이 재빨리 웃으며 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “최종 오디션 주의 사항 알려 드리려고 왔어요.” “아, 죄송해요. 화장실 다녀오느라고요.” “괜찮습니다. 최종 오디션은 카메라 앞에 두고 대사 한 마디를 할 거예요. 그것만 잘해주시면 돼요.” “대사가 뭔데요?” “죄송해요. 공정을 위해서 대사는 최종 오디션 때 알려드려요.” 파마머리 조연출은 머리를 긁적였다. 엄마는 알았다며 고개를 끄덕였다. 하지만 이미 나는 그 중요한 대사를 알았다. 아빠.","completion":"Episode 4 It's been about ten days since I clenched ten thousand won at my first birthday celebration, but my life hasn't changed. I wake up, eat, sleep again, naturally do my business, and then eat again. I've gained some strength in my legs, enough to walk by holding onto shelves, but my speech is still underdeveloped. How many years must I live this listless life before I can start making money? I pondered this while rolling around with a baby bottle in my mouth. [How can I make money?] I never missed the economic section of the daily news. It seemed the future hadn't changed. There was nothing different from the year 1992 that I remembered. [Then, to start making money, I need some seed money...] Even my grandfather, the founder of Samjeon Group, started with the money he made from selling a cow in his rural home. Ding-dong. The doorbell rang. Mom, holding her back, stood up and looked at the intercom screen, then hurried to open the front door. \\"Sister!\\" The only person mom calls \\"sister\\" was the short-haired landlady. Today, the short-haired lady was wearing a stylish suit. \\"Seongguk's mom, staying at home?\\" Her usual straightforwardness. \\"It's because of the baby. I plan to work once Seongguk grows up.\\" The short-haired lady handed mom a few brochures. \\"Then, try applying for this.\\" \\"What's this?\\" \\"Our company is looking for a baby model for an advertisement. Since I work there, give it a try.\\" \\"Sister, you work at an advertising agency?\\" \\"Don't worry about the details. Just get the photos developed, fill out the application form, and give it to me by the day after tomorrow.\\" An advertisement model? My mind suddenly became alert. Instinctively, I felt this could be a way to make money. Crawling around with a baby bottle was the only thing I could do at the moment. Fortunately, my innate sense for money seemed fine in this life too. The short-haired lady scrutinized my face. \\"You have a face that will look good on screen. Give it a try. What do you have to lose? It's not like there's any other way for a family as poor as yours to make money.\\" [Exactly!] To escape this dire poverty, I needed to gather some seed money by any means necessary. My goal now was one hundred million won. It's hard to gather the first one hundred million, but after that, money makes money, such is the nature of capitalism. The IMF crisis is not far off! With just some seed money, I could use all my knowledge to lift this poor family up. Mom looked doubtful. \\"Seongguk is the most beautiful child in the world to us, but... will others think the same? He's still so young.\\" [What are you talking about? I look at myself in the mirror every day. This face is not common!] I grumbled as angrily as I could, but mom's expression remained stiff. \\"I'm just trying to help, but if you don't like it, there's nothing I can do.\\" The moment the short-haired lady tried to take back the brochure, I cried out loudly once more. \\"Eung. Eung. Eung.\\" Translated, it meant: [Mom, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!] Finally, mom looked down at me. \\"Do you want to do it, Seongguk?\\" Nod, nod. I nodded my head firmly twice. I almost did a head dive onto the floor because I put too much strength into my neck, not considering the weight of a child's head just past his first birthday. The short-haired lady quickly caught my signal. \\"Give it a try. They pick babies based on their faces, but they prefer babies who don't cry easily and understand what's being said during the shoot. Seongguk seems smart, so let's test him.\\" \\"Should we?\\" Mom still looked worried. I fiercely grabbed mom's skirt, which was bulging with her belly. [Mom, just trust me!] * * * Screech. The bus arrived in Itaewon. Mom struggled to get off the bus while holding me. Dad had given mom a ten-thousand-won note, telling her to take a taxi because she was pregnant, but mom chose to take the bus instead. Thus, I rode a bus for the first time in my life. And due to the bus's jolting, I experienced severe motion sickness. My stomach was already in turmoil. [If my condition is this bad during the audition, it's going to be tough...] I swallowed my dry saliva and entered a building in Itaewon while being held by mom. Mom took a few deep breaths in the lobby before heading to the information desk. \\"Excuse me... Where is the baby audition held today?\\" \\"The conference room on the third floor. Go right and take the elevator.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Mom held my hand tightly and headed for the elevator. With just the photos taken with a disposable camera handed over by the short-haired lady, I easily passed the document screening. Only ten children who passed the documents were auditioning today. Ding. The sound of the elevator stopping was heard. As soon as the door opened, mom stepped into the elevator. Inside the elevator, there was a child who seemed to be my competitor today, along with his parents. Mom's black long dress, which she wears occasionally on dates with dad, seemed shabby compared to the woman in the elevator wearing a designer dress and holding a handbag. The person holding a child who appeared to be my age was a middle-aged woman, seemingly a nanny. The woman with the designer bag coldly glanced at me and mom, then hurriedly left the elevator as soon as it reached the third floor. Her face was as if she was disgusted, as if germs had spread inside the elevator. Before my regression, I too looked at others with such a face. I disliked sharing an elevator with regular employees so much that there was even a private elevator for me within the Samjeon Group. To think that I've become such a person... I felt a bit down. Mom patted my bottom. \\"Seongguk, you can't fall asleep.\\" [I'm not sleepy. I'm just feeling heavy-hearted.] \\"Seongguk, let's eat something delicious with the money dad gave us for a taxi after this. How about chicken?\\" [That's what mom wants to eat. I can't even chew chicken yet because my teeth haven't fully grown.] \\"Mom will buy you a banana, Seongguk.\\" [Alright, a banana. That'll cheer me up.] Mom followed the signs to the audition room marked as the final audition location. * * * Ten mothers holding their children listened to the instructions from a permed hair assistant director. \\"First, the director will conduct a camera test. Only two to three children who pass the camera test will proceed to the final test. When I call your name, please come forward for the camera test.\\" \\"Yes.\\" The other mothers answered with a slightly nervous and excited tone. Among them, only mom seemed a bit dispirited. Mom was looking at the other children's outfits. None of the children were dressed in almost pajama-like outfits like me. They were all dressed up to the point of being childish. I pulled on mom. And then I smiled brightly. [Mom, appearances aren't important. My face is worth a million dollars.] Mom managed to gather her spirits and smiled. \\"Seongguk, let's do well.\\" [Of course, I'll do well.] After several children went in, it was finally my turn. The dazzling lights and reflectors. And a camera appeared in front of me. The camera was a medium I was quite familiar with. Living as the eldest son of the Samjeon Group, whether I wanted to or not, there were countless occasions where I had to stand in front of a camera. Therefore, within the Samjeon Group, there was even a team dedicated to my camera tests and interview responses. Whether it was when I was leaving the airport, inspecting factories or company buildings, shaking hands with the president, or even when I had to go to court for unpleasant reasons, everything was prepared. Which camera angle made me look better, which color suited me more, and even skin treatments at the dermatologist before important days. Under the bright lights, I remembered the camera flashes that used to pour down on me before my regression. \\"Seongguk, is it?\\" The director, looking like a bandit, stared at me from behind the camera. \\"Jeon Seongguk?\\" [Director, why do you keep calling?] I immediately looked at the director. \\"How old is Seongguk?\\" \\"He's 14 months old, Director.\\" Mom quickly answered. The director turned his gaze back to me. \\"Now, Seongguk. The camera will start filming you. Don't be too surprised, and please, don't cry like the other kids this time. I'm begging you. My eardrums are almost torn today.\\" Nod, nod. I nodded my head as if I understood, grinning. \\"He seems to understand what I'm saying.\\" \\"Among all the kids I've seen, he seems to understand the best, Director.\\" The female staff member who patted my head agreed. \\"I was just saying. How could a baby understand? Alright, let's start the camera test.\\" As soon as the director finished speaking, the camera started filming me. It wasn't a photo shoot but a video, so there was no shutter sound, but the lights were quite strong. I smiled, laughed heartily, and showed a bit of sassiness to the camera. Sometimes, I looked away and rolled around like a child. I also mixed in some recently learned \\"jamjam\\" and \\"no no\\" gestures into my poses. It was the result of practicing in front of the mirrors at home for the camera test. Mom, standing in the corner, looked at me with a moved expression. [It's too early to be moved.] I quickly changed my posture and slightly turned my head back to throw a wink. Wink! Applause erupted simultaneously. The director smiled contentedly and raised his hand. \\"Stop! No need to film more. This kid is definitely going to the finals. Passed!\\" Grin. I slightly lifted the corner of my right mouth. [Easy peasy.] * * * In the final audition, it was me and the son of the woman with the designer bag who made it. It was surprising that this kid made it to the finals, considering there were many kids cuter than him. I sharply observed my competitor. To win a competition, analyzing the enemy was the top priority. But the kid who made it with me had no particular features other than round eyes. Mom sat next to me, slightly trembling her legs, clearly nervous. \\"Seongguk, don't be nervous.\\" [Nervousness is for mom, not me.] \\"Seongguk seems very nervous. But mom really needs to go to the bathroom...\\" As soon as mom finished speaking, the woman with the designer bag signaled the middle-aged woman holding the baby. Then, the middle-aged woman spoke to mom. \\"I'll watch the baby for you. Go to the bathroom.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Of course.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Mom looked at me. \\"Seongguk, mom will be back soon from the bathroom, so listen to the lady, okay?\\" \\"Okay.\\" I nodded. Being pregnant makes you want to go to the bathroom often, so it seemed mom had been holding it in for me until now. Mom quickly got up and left the waiting room. The middle-aged woman glanced at me and muttered. \\"The baby is quite pretty.\\" \\"What did you say?\\" The woman with the designer bag asked sharply. \\"Nothing, ma'am. Just saying.\\" \\"If he's pretty, why don't you raise that house's child?\\" \\"I'm sorry, ma'am.\\" \\"Be careful with your words. The baby can hear everything. Really ignorant.\\" [Who's the ignorant one here? Tsk tsk.] I clicked my tongue inwardly. Click. The door to the waiting room opened, and the permed hair assistant director entered. She quickly bowed her head to the woman with the designer bag. \\"Ma'am, did you make your baby practice a lot?\\" [Wait, what's going on here? This woman already knows the content of the final audition script.] The woman with the designer bag nodded. \\"We're just trying to create childhood memories for our child, so why is it so difficult? Why does our child have to compete with this one?\\" [This one? Is she referring to me, Jeon Seongguk?] I felt a slight headache coming on. I quickly understood the situation. The model had already been decided, and the audition was just a formality. Moreover, the reason they willingly offered to watch me while mom went to the bathroom was to coordinate their story with the assistant director. \\"Ma'am, please bear with it a little longer. It would be troublesome if the director noticed.\\" \\"Doesn't the director know our family?\\" \\"The director isn't that kind of person. That's why the higher-ups said to keep the director in the dark until the final. This kid is doing it for the first time, so he probably won't be able to do it. Did you make dad practice a lot?\\" \\"We even hired a special teacher for diction. Don't worry.\\" At that moment, mom's footsteps were heard in the hallway. As mom entered the room, the assistant director quickly smiled and looked at her. \\"I came to inform you about the precautions for the final audition.\\" \\"Oh, I'm sorry. I went to the bathroom.\\" \\"It's okay. The final audition will involve saying a single line in front of the camera. That's all you need to do.\\" \\"What's the line?\\" \\"Sorry. For fairness, we'll inform you of the line during the final audition.\\" The permed hair assistant director scratched her head. Mom nodded in understanding. But I already knew that important line. Dad."},{"prompt":"Here is the query client asked me: We have a question regarding the accessibility of charts on our platform. We are unsure if charts can be viewed as ‘complex images’ and therefore only require descriptive measures, or of charts have to comply to other WCAG criteria as well. We are particularly looking into: • 1.4.1 Use of color • 1.4.11 Non-text contrast If these criteria need to be met for charts, we have explored some possible solutions like adding space between the elements and a darker border, and the use of a tooltip to not rely on color alone.

Here is the answer I prepared: Charts are indeed considered under WCAG guidelines, and they require attention to various criteria to ensure accessibility, including but not limited to “Use of Color” (1.4.1) and “Non-text Contrast” (1.4.11). Here are the descriptions for WCAG 1.4.1 and WCAG 1.4.11: 1.4.1 Use of Color: This guideline states that color should not be the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. For charts, relying solely on color differences to differentiate elements does not comply with this criterion. It’s imperative to use patterns or shapes to differentiate elements, ensuring accessibility for users with color vision deficiencies. Patterns or shapes provide a fundamental solution for conveying information that is not dependent on color perception. Additionally, while tooltips can offer valuable textual information when elements are hovered over or selected, it’s important to note their limitations on mobile platforms, where hover interactions are not available. This limitation makes tooltips a less reliable sole strategy for conveying essential information on these devices. Therefore, incorporating patterns or shapes is strongly recommended to ensure broad accessibility, with tooltips serving as a complementary, but not primary, method for providing information. 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast: This criterion refers to the visual presentation of UI components and graphical objects having a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors for their states and boundaries. For charts, ensuring that graphical elements like axes, lines, and data points stand out sufficiently against the background or other elements is crucial. The current idea of adding dark borders and increasing the spacing between elements can enhance the visibility and legibility of charts. However, it’s essential to manually check the contrast ratios to ensure they meet the minimum requirements. Tools like Color Contrast Analyzer (CCA) can be helpful. To summarize, charts on your platform need to comply with WCAG guidelines, particularly those concerning the use of color and non-text contrast. Adopting patterns or shapes to distinguish elements is essential for meeting accessibility standards, especially for users with color vision deficiencies. While employing tooltips, increasing spacing, and enhancing borders contribute positively, it’s crucial to recognize tooltips’ limitations on mobile platforms. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to accessibility that combines visual differentiation with alternative ways to access information is key. Your task is to add below points: 1. \\"We are assuming that the charts mentioned below are the static charts.\\": You need to add this before my statement. Correct the verbiage accordingly. 2.

Обычно, когда мы говорим об убытках (в финансовом смысле), мы имеем в виду потерю стоимости или отрицательный финансовый результат от операции, инвестиции или от других финансовых действий. Так что если вы говорите о сумме ваших убытков, это будет отрицательная сумма, показывающая, на сколько уменьшилась стоимость ваших инвестиций по сравнению с изначально вложенными средствами. Таким образом, когда вы рассчитываете, какова должна быть цена для достижения точки безубыточности, вы фактически ищете, на какую величину должна увеличиться стоимость ваших инвестиций, чтобы компенсировать эту отрицательную разницу, а также покрыть любые связанные с инвестицией расходы, включая комиссии."},{"prompt":"как зная общее количество лотов узнать какой процент от депозита они состовляют","completion":"Чтобы вычислить, какой процент от общего размера депозита составляет инвестированная сумма в лоты, следует выполнить несколько простых шагов.

В этом случае: - Общая стоимость лотов (инвестиций) = 10 000 долларов. - Размер депозита = 50 000 долларов. Подставив эти значения в формулу, получим: [% от депозита = left(frac{10 000}{50 000}right) times 100% = 20%] Значит, купленные вами лоты составляют 20% от общего размера вашего депозита."},{"prompt":"как зная общее количество лотов узнать какой процент от депозита они составляют в mql5","completion":"Чтобы вычислить, какой процент от депозита составляет определенное количество лотов в MQL5, необходимо принять во внимание несколько важных параметров: 1. **Объем одного лота** - этот параметр зависит от рынка, на котором вы торгуете, и может существенно отличаться для разных инструментов. Например, на Форексе стандартный лот равен 100,000 единицам базовой валюты. 2. **Маржинальные требования** - эта информация нужна для расчета необходимой маржи для открытия позиции. Маржинальные требования могут различаться в зависимости от брокера и типа инструмента. Эти требования обычно выражены в процентах от стоимости контракта. 3. **Курс обмена валюты депозита на валюту пары** (если базовая валюта пары и валюта депозита различаются). Примерный алгоритм расчета выглядит следующим образом: 1. Определите размер позиции в валюте депозита. Например, если вы торгуете парой EURUSD, покупая 1 лот (100,000 EUR), и ваш депозит в USD, необходимо умножить объем в евро на текущий курс EURUSD, чтобы получить эквивалент в долларах США. 2. Рассчитайте необходимую маржу. Допустим, маржинальные требования составляют 1%. Это значит, что для покупки 1 лота EURUSD с текущим курсом, например, 1.1000, и объемом позиции в 110,000 необходимо будет иметь на счету минимум 1,100 в качестве маржи. 3. Чтобы выяснить, какой процент от депозита составляет необходимая маржа для данного количества лотов, разделите сумму маржи на общий размер вашего депозита и умножьте на 100. Пример кода для определения процента маржи от депозита в MQL5 может выглядеть как-то так: \`\`\`mql5 // Параметры double lotSize = 1.0; // размер лота string symbol = \\"EURUSD\\"; // символ double marginRequirement = 0.01; // маржинальные требования (1%) // Получаем необходимые данные double contractSize = SymbolInfoDouble(symbol, SYMBOL_TRADE_CONTRACT_SIZE); // размер контракта double leverage = AccountLeverage(); // кредитное плечо double exchangeRate = SymbolInfoDouble(symbol, SYMBOL_BID); // обменный курс // Рассчитываем объем в валюте депозита double volumeInDepositCurrency = lotSize * contractSize * exchangeRate; // Рассчитываем необходимую маржу double requiredMargin = volumeInDepositCurrency * marginRequirement; // Подсчет процента маржи от депозита double deposit = AccountBalance(); // баланс счета double marginPercentage = requiredMargin / deposit * 100; // Вывод результатов PrintFormat(\\"Необходимая маржа составляет: %.2f USD, что является %.2f%% от депозита\\", requiredMargin, marginPercentage); \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что данный код является упрощенным примером и может потребовать настройки под конкретные условия вашего торгового счета и маржинальных требований вашего брокера."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"coffee in shop with flower\\"","completion":"coffee in shop with flower"},{"prompt":"the following function create a json object from excel file , the problem is some of the columns in the sheet have int and string values so the json serialize the int as int and the string as string , i want it to instead of that checks if the values of the columns are mixed between int and string to make the whole column string in a way that the 0 becomes \\"0\\" in the json import pandas as pd import json import os def excel_to_json(excel_file_path): \\"\\"\\"Convert a given Excel file into a Dictionary where each one of the sheets in the object is represented by a key,value pair.

This principle stands out because it's fundamentally about cultivating a mindset that is both flexible and curious, qualities that are crucial not only for personal growth but also for navigating the complexities of the modern world. The idea of being open to new data and ideas attracted me for a couple of reasons. Firstly, in a world that is rapidly changing and where information is abundant, the ability to update one's understanding based on new evidence is essential for remaining relevant and making informed decisions. This is something that I strive to practice in my academic, professional, and personal life. Secondly, embracing this value fosters an environment of learning and innovation, encouraging us not to be confined by our existing notions or prejudices, which is vital for societal progress and harmony. To incorporate this ideal into my daily life, I've adopted several practical habits. One of them is dedicating time each week to educate myself on topics outside of my immediate interests or expertise. This could involve reading articles, watching documentaries, or attending workshops, which exposes me to different perspectives and new information. Another practice is engaging in discussions with people who hold differing views without the aim of convincing them but rather to understand their perspective. This has not only broadened my view but has also improved my empathy and communication skills. For those looking to adopt this value, my advice would be to cultivate humility and recognize that no one has all the answers. Approach each conversation as an opportunity to learn something new. Secondly, challenge your own assumptions regularly by asking questions like, \\"What evidence would change my mind?\\" This encourages a mindset that is open to change based on new information. Lastly, surround yourself with diverse voices and seek out sources of information that are reputable and evidence-based, to ensure that the new data and ideas you are open to are credible and enrich your understanding of the world around you. In conclusion, being open to new data and ideas is a value that can significantly enhance one's ability to learn, adapt, and connect with others. By actively seeking out new information, questioning our assumptions, and engaging with diverse perspectives, we can lead more informed, balanced, and fulfilling lives."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Дело в том, что, хотя фотограмметрия представляет собой мощный инструмент для сбора данных о поверхности Земли и имеет множество преимуществ, она не может полностью исключить необходимость в традиционных геодезических методах в некоторых ситуациях. Рассмотрим основные причины: # Преимущества фотограмметрии 1. **Быстрота сбора данных и обработки** – Фотограмметрические методы могут быть значительно быстрее традиционных геодезических методов, особенно при работе на больших территориях. 2. **Получение пространственных моделей** – Фотограмметрия позволяет создавать детализированные 3D модели объектов и местности, что особенно полезно для планирования, моделирования и анализа. 3. **Доступ к труднодоступным областям** – С использованием дронов и других воздушных средств фотограмметрия может обеспечить данные по областям, к которым трудно или невозможно получить доступ наземным путем. # Ограничения фотограмметрии и необходимость в традиционных методах 1. **Точность измерений** – В некоторых случаях, особенно для высокоточных инженерных или строительных работ, традиционные геодезические методы (например, нивелирование, тахеометрия) предоставляют более точные результаты, чем фотограмметрия. 2. **Стоимость оборудования и обработки данных** – Высококачественное фотограмметрическое оборудование и ПО для обработки данных могут быть дорогими, что делает их использование менее доступным для небольших проектов или организаций с ограниченным бюджетом. 3. **Подверженность внешним условиям** – Фотограмметрические методы могут быть ограничены погодными условиями и освещением, в то время как некоторые традиционные методы меньше зависят от этих факторов. 4. **Необходимость валидации данных** – Во многих случаях данные, полученные с помощью фотограмметрии, требуют валидации с использованием традиционных геодезических методов, чтобы обеспечить их точность и пригодность для использования. В заключение можно сказать, что фотограмметрия является ценным дополнением к инструментарию геодезических исследований, но не может полностью заменить традиционные методы. Оба подхода часто используются совместно для достижения наилучших результатов в измерениях и исследованиях."},{"prompt":"как сохранить файлы rcp в версии рекапа 2019","completion":"Autodesk ReCap, начиная с версии 2019, предоставляет два основных формата файлов проекта: RCP и RCS. RCP является форматом файла проекта, который содержит ссылки на один или несколько файлов сканирования (RCS), а также информацию о настройках проекта и структуре. RCS являются фактическими файлами сканированных точек, которые хранят данные облака точек. Для сохранения файла в формате RCP в Autodesk ReCap 2019, выполните следующие шаги: 1. **Импорт данных облака точек**: Запустите Autodesk ReCap и импортируйте данные облака точек, которые вы хотите использовать в проекте. Это могут быть данные из сканирования, собранные с помощью лазерного сканера, или другие совместимые форматы облаков точек. 2. **Обработка и настройка проекта**: После импорта данных вы можете выполнить различные операции обработки, такие как удаление ненужных объектов, настройку точности и масштаба, а также другие модификации вашего облака точек. 3. **Сохранение проекта в формате RCP**: - Перейдите в меню \\"Файл\\" (File) в верхнем левом углу программы. - Выберите опцию \\"Сохранить как\\" (Save As) или \\"Экспорт\\" (Export), в зависимости от вашей версии ReCap. В некоторых версиях может быть непосредственно опция \\"Сохранить проект\\" (Save Project). - В диалоговом окне сохранения файла выберите место, где вы хотите сохранить файл проекта. - В поле \\"Тип файла\\" (File Type) выберите формат \\"ReCap Project File (*.rcp)\\". - Введите имя файла и нажмите кнопку \\"Сохранить\\" (Save). После выполнения этих шагов ваш проект будет сохранён в формате RCP в указанном месте. Обратите внимание, что проект RCP будет ссылаться на один или несколько файлов RCS, содержащих данные облаков точек, поэтому убедитесь, что вы также сохраняете и эти файлы в безопасном месте вместе с вашим RCP файлом проекта.

Так как Autodesk Revit не всегда обратно совместим с новыми форматами файлов из более поздних версий других продуктов Autodesk, например, ReCap 2024, существует несколько подходов, которые можно применить для работы с файлами из ReCap 2024 в Revit 2019. # 1. Использование совместимого формата Один из подходов заключается в экспорте файлов облака точек из ReCap в формат, который поддерживается Revit 2019. Обычно это файлы в формате RCP или RCS, которые Revit может интерпретировать как ссылку на облако точек. # Инструкция: 1. **В ReCap 2024**: Экспортируйте ваш проект облака точек в формате RCP или RCS. 2. **В Revit 2019**: - Зайдите во вкладку \\"Вставка\\" (Insert). - Нажмите на \\"Ссылка на облако точек\\" (Link Point Cloud). - Выберите экспортированный файл. Однако, следует быть осторожными, так как прямой экспорт может не всегда гарантировать полную совместимость или наилучшее качество данных, особенно если в более новой версии ReCap были использованы возможности, не поддерживаемые в Revit 2019. # 2. Преобразование формата через стороннее ПО Если прямое совместное использование форматов не работает должным образом, можно попытаться конвертировать файлы с помощью стороннего программного обеспечения или онлайн-сервисов, специализирующихся на работе с облаками точек и 3D-моделями. Необходимо найти инструмент, который выведет данные в формат, пригодный для использования в Revit 2019. # 3. Использование более старой версии ReCap для пересохранения Если у вас есть доступ к более старой версии ReCap, которая совместима с Revit 2019: 1. Откройте файлы из ReCap 2024 в этой версии. 2. Сохраните или экспортируйте проект в формате, который совместим с Revit 2019. # Важно: - Наличие последних обновлений и пакетов улучшения для Revit 2019 может улучшить совместимость с новыми форматами файлов. - Обратите внимание, что иногда прямая совместимость не достижима из-за ограничений в изменениях форматов файлов между версиями продуктов. # Заключение: Лучший способ обеспечить совместимость данных из ReCap 2024 в Revit 2019 — использовать поддерживаемые оба продукта форматы файлов и проверить наличие всех доступных обновлений для Revit, которые могут улучшить совместную работу с более новыми данными."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art coffee in shop with flower","completion":"Coffee & Blossom Moments | Artwork for Mugs, Paintings, Shirts | Home and Lifestyle Design"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Для расчета процентного соотношения ваших лотов к депозиту можно использовать следующую формулу: [ text{Процент лотов от депозита} = left( frac{text{Объем в лотах} times text{Маржа на лот}}{text{Размер депозита}} right) times 100 ] Давайте приведем простой пример. **Предположим, ваш размер депозита составляет 10,000 USD, вы торгуете лотами по EUR/USD, а маржинальные требования равны 1000 USD за лот. Если вы управляете 3 лотами, ваш расчет будет следующим:** 1. Объем в лотах = 3 2. Маржа на лот = 1000 USD 3. Размер депозита = 10,000 USD Исходя из этого: [ text{Процент лотов от депозита} = left( frac{3 times 1000}{10000} right) times 100 = 30% ] Это значит, что ваша текущая позиция в лотах составляет 30% от общего депозита. Обратите внимание, что для точных вычислений следует учитывать текущие курсы валют и возможные изменения в маржинальных требованиях, если вы торгуете в различных инструментах. В MQL5 вы можете автоматизировать эти расчеты, используя функции для получения данных о текущем балансе счета (\`AccountBalance()\`), маржинальных требованиях для открытия позиций (\`MarketInfo()\` с параметром \`MODE_MARGINREQUIRED\`) и объеме существующих позиций (\`PositionSelect()\` и \`PositionGetDouble(POSITION_VOLUME)\` для получения информации по каждой открытой позиции)."},{"prompt":"وقتی یه کانفیگ وایرگارد که داخل Nekobox میسازیم میکنه اما وقتی اون کانفیگو که داخل Nekobox کار میکنه از طریق Nekobox کپی میکنم و وارد v2rayNG میکنیم کار نمیکنه دوست دارم برام یه کاری انجام بدی که اون کافنیگ داخل v2rayNG کار کنه این مشلکو برام برطرف کن","completion":"برای حل این مشکل، ابتدا مهم است که توجه داشته باشید WireGuard و V2Ray دو پروتکل متفاوت برای ایجاد اتصالات VPN هستند.

This applies to single-argument constructors or constructors that can be called with a single argument (assuming the rest of the parameters have default values). In the absence of \`explicit\`, C++ allows constructors with a single argument to be invoked implicitly to convert types. This feature can be useful but sometimes leads to unexpected behavior or bugs if the programmer did not intend for such a conversion to happen automatically. Here's an example to illustrate the purpose of \`explicit\`: Without \`explicit\`: \`\`\`cpp class MyClass { public: MyClass(int x) {} // Single argument constructor }; void myFunction(MyClass obj) { // Function doing something with obj } int main() { myFunction(10); // Implicit conversion from int to MyClass return 0; } \`\`\` In this case, the call \`myFunction(10);\` is valid because the compiler can implicitly use \`MyClass(int)\` to convert \`10\` into an instance of \`MyClass\`. With \`explicit\`: \`\`\`cpp class MyClass { public: explicit MyClass(int x) {} // Single argument constructor with explicit keyword }; void myFunction(MyClass obj) { // Function doing something with obj } int main() { myFunction(10); // This line will now cause a compilation error // myFunction(MyClass(10)); // This is now required for conversion. return 0; } \`\`\` Now, the call \`myFunction(10);\` will cause a compilation error because \`MyClass\`'s constructor is marked as \`explicit\`, preventing the implicit conversion. The programmer must now do the conversion explicitly by calling \`MyClass(10)\`. Using \`explicit\` is a good practice when defining constructors that can be called with a single argument to prevent unintended type conversions, thus making the code's intention clearer and preventing potential bugs. It can also be used with C++11's explicit conversion operators to prevent implicit conversions in user-defined type conversion scenarios."},{"prompt":"Ok, thank you. What is the expected usage of noexpect keyword?","completion":"The \`noexcept\` keyword in C++ is used to specify whether a function is expected to throw exceptions or not. It serves as a guarantee to the compiler and programmers that a function marked with \`noexcept\` will not exit by throwing an exception. This keyword was introduced in C++11 as part of the effort to provide a more explicit mechanism for handling exceptions and to replace the now-deprecated exception specifications like \`throw()\`. # Expected Usage of \`noexcept\` 1. **Performance Optimization**: Since a \`noexcept\` function promises not to throw any exceptions, compilers can sometimes generate more optimized code by omitting the code that would typically be needed to unwind the stack in case exceptions are thrown. 2. **Move Operations**: In modern C++ (C++11 and later), move constructors and move assignment operators should generally be marked as \`noexcept\`. This is because certain operations, like resizing a \`std::vector\`, may choose to use move semantics for efficient element transfer, but they will only do so if the move operations are \`noexcept\`. If the operations are not marked as \`noexcept\`, these operations may instead fall back to copy semantics for safety, which can be significantly slower. 3. **Safe Exception Handling and API Design**: By marking functions as \`noexcept\`, you are making a clear statement about the behavior of your function with respect to exception safety. This can help in designing safer APIs and in ensuring that exceptions are handled at appropriate levels in the application. # Syntax and Usage - **Using \`noexcept\` without any condition:** Simply appending \`noexcept\` to a function declaration tells the compiler that the function is expected not to throw exceptions. \`\`\`cpp void myFunction() noexcept; \`\`\` - **Using \`noexcept\` with a condition:** It's also possible to conditionally declare a function as \`noexcept\` by providing a boolean expression to the \`noexcept\` keyword. The function is declared as \`noexcept\` only if the expression evaluates to true. \`\`\`cpp void myConditionalNoexceptFunction() noexcept(true); // Always noexcept void myConditionalNoexceptFunction2() noexcept(false); // Not noexcept \`\`\` - **\`noexcept\` Operator:** C++ also provides the \`noexcept\` operator, which can be used to check if an expression is \`noexcept\`. This is particularly useful in templates or in conditional \`noexcept\` specifications. \`\`\`cpp void anotherFunction() noexcept(noexcept(myFunction())); \`\`\` # Key Points - Use \`noexcept\` for functions that are not expected to throw exceptions. This includes most destructors, move constructors, and move assignment operators. - Be cautious when declaring functions as \`noexcept\`. If a \`noexcept\` function does throw an exception, the program will call \`std::terminate()\`, leading to immediate program termination. Hence, only use \`noexcept\` when you are confident that the function will not throw any exceptions. - The \`noexcept\` specifier is part of the function's type, affecting function overloading and template instantiation. Using \`noexcept\` judiciously can lead to more efficient and safer C++ code, especially in critical performance paths and library interfaces."},{"prompt":"mejora la redaccion para hacerla mas entendible: \\"Realizar una búsqueda exhaustiva y crítica de literatura científica sobre la viscosidad de mezclas multicomponentes en crudos pesados, con énfasis en la optimización de diluyentes para crudos venezolanos.

Annotation: In \\"Digital Literacy in the 21st Century: Bridging Theory and Practice,\\" authors Johnathan A. Smith and Linda E. Burke delve into the evolving definition of digital literacy and its critical role in educational curricula worldwide. Smith and Burke argue that traditional literacy alone is no longer sufficient for success in the modern world; instead, a comprehensive approach that integrates digital skills is essential. They support their thesis by examining multiple case studies where digital literacy programs were successfully implemented in school curriculums, demonstrating marked improvements in student engagement and learning outcomes. The information present in this article is directly applicable to the discussion I intend to present, which focuses on the integration of digital literacy in high school education. This source provides a foundational understanding of why digital literacy is imperative in today's educational landscape. It offers empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks that I will use to argue for more substantial digital literacy components in the curriculum. Despite its thorough exploration of the benefits of digital literacy, the article also presents challenges such as access disparities and the potential for technology to distract from traditional learning. In responding to these positions, I will discuss how strategic planning and resource allocation can mitigate these concerns, drawing on additional research and recommendations from Smith and Burke. Personally, this piece resonated with me due to my observations of the technological gap in education within my community. The article reinforced my belief in the necessity of comprehensive digital literacy education and provided a scholarly foundation to support this advocacy.

По мере прохождения игры на игрока нападают злые Рики, которые случайно генерируются в видимой части игрового поля и двигаются влево-вправо в пределах 500 пикселей от точки появления. При контакте игрока со злым Рики слышится звук удара. Игра заканчивается, как только игрок доходит до конца карты (пограничной башни) и достигает правого местоположения или происходит смерть персонажа, а таймер останавливается. 8. За каждый съеденный пончик дается 10 HP. 9. За каждое соприкосновение со злым Риком отбирается 20 HP. Если контакт длится больше 2-х секунд, то 20 HP списывается за каждую полную секунду контакта. 10. Если жизни игрока кончаются (0HP), то игра заканчивается. 11. Жизни игрока (HP) расходуются со скоростью 1HP/с при перемещении персонажа. 12. Пончики на карте должны генерироваться случайным образом, одновременно на экране должно быть не более 3 пончиков. Пончики располагаются на возвышенностях. 13. Для того, чтобы достать пончик, персонажу необходимо запрыгнуть на возвышенность, подпрыгнув. Он может находиться на возвышенности неограниченное время. 14. Для того, чтобы увернуться от злого Рика, персонажу необходимо перепрыгнуть его, спрятаться под землю или запрыгнуть на возвышенность. 15. При уходе под землю, персонаж не виден на экране и не может передвигаться влево-вправо. Для того чтобы персонаж появился из-под земли, необходимо нажать клавишу «W». 16. При нажатии на кнопку «ESC» или «Пробел» игра ставится на паузу и появляется диалоговое окно «Пауза» с кнопками «Продолжить» и «Вернуться к началу игры», а при повторном нажатии - снимается с паузы. Во время паузы останавливаются все интерактивные действия, а также вся анимация, таймер тоже замирает, прекращается трата HP, игрок и злые Рики не двигаются. 17. Когда игрок идет обратно, он поворачивается в обратную сторону. 18. Ваша игра должна работать без отображения JavaScript ошибок или сообщений в консоли браузера. 19. Ваш HTML/CSS и JavaScript код должен быть организован и понятен. Используйте корректные наименования переменных, методов и не забывайте оставлять комментарии для дальнейшей поддержки в будущем. 20. После завершения игры результаты должны быть сохранены на сервере и показана таблица с рейтингом. Баллы для рейтинга рассчитываются по формуле: 1000 – затраченное время в секундах + количество съеденных пончиков*10. 21. После завершения игры открывается экран результатов, в котором формируется таблица с лучшими 10 игроками; если игрок не вошел в таблицу, то выводятся 9 лучших игроков, а в последней строке указывается место и результат игрока, только что завершившего игру. 22. На экране результатов должна быть кнопка «Играть сначала», которая позволяет начать игру с начала, на игровом экране (первый экран и ролик не отображаются). При рестарте игры у игрока 100HP, таймер на 00:00, 0 пончиков. 23. В левом верхнем углу необходимо расположить значок «14+» (на стартовой экране) Проявите все свои навыки для создания качественной игры, с анимацией и интерактивностью. Также важен дизайн игры и соответствие целевой группе: 14+.","completion":"Реализация такой сложной игры в рамках одного ответа невозможна, но я могу предоставить вам примерный план того, как подойти к быстрой разработке этой игры, а также некоторые полезные фрагменты кода. # 1. Подготовительный этап - **Создайте основную структуру проекта:** Разделите ваш проект на части: HTML-файлы, CSS-файлы, JavaScript-файлы. Отдельно разместите медиафайлы (изображения, звуки). - **Подготовка графики и звуков:** Организуйте все изображения и аудиофайлы в соответствующих папках в вашем проекте. # 2. HTML и CSS - Создайте стартовый экран игры, используя HTML и CSS. Реализуйте форму для ввода имени игрока и кнопку начала игры. Также добавьте инструкции и возможность выбора персонажа. - Разработайте экран игры: отображение HP, счетчика пончиков, имени игрока и таймера. - Создайте паузу и окончания игры экраны с соответствующими функциональными кнопками. # 3. JavaScript Logic - Напишите логику для активации кнопки \\"Начать\\" только в случае, если введено имя игрока. - Реализуйте воспроизведение мультика-интро при старте. Включите возможность пропустить его нажатием на пробел. - Напишите логику игры: перемещение персонажа, генерация врагов и пончиков, обработка столкновений и изменения HP. - Создайте таймер для учета времени игры. - Добавьте функционал кнопки \\"Выключить звук\\". - Реализуйте систему паузы и рестарта игры. # Пример JavaScript кода для старта игры и валидации имени игрока: \`\`\`javascript window.onload = function() { const startButton = document.getElementById(\\"start-button\\"); const playerNameInput = document.getElementById(\\"player-name\\"); // Активация кнопки \\"Начать\\", если введено имя playerNameInput.oninput = function() { let playerName = playerNameInput.value.trim(); startButton.disabled = playerName === \\"\\"; }; // Обработка нажатия на кнопку \\"Начать\\" startButton.onclick = function() { let playerName = playerNameInput.value.trim(); if (playerName !== \\"\\") { // Здесь код для перехода к интро или началу игры startGame(playerName); } }; }; function startGame(playerName) { // Отображение экрана интро или переход к игре console.log(\`Игра началась для игрока: {playerName}\`); // Логика начала игры... } \`\`\` # Дальнейшие шаги: - Далее вам нужно будет реализовать оставшуюся логику игры, следуя инструкциям в вашем вопросе. Это включает обработку ввода пользователя для управления персонажем, создание врагов, логику жизней, таймер игры и так далее. - Для поддержания структуры кода разбейте его на модули, используя функции для каждого действия (например, \`moveCharacter\`, \`generateEnemy\`, \`eatDonut\`, \`gameOver\`, и т.д.). Разработка игры - это комплексная задача, требующая внимания к деталям и хорошего планирования.

[쯧쯧.] 나는 고개를 도리도리 저었다. 감독이 내 모습을 흐뭇하게 바라보는 게 느껴졌다. 파마머리 조연출이 잽싸게 끼어들었다. “감독님, 대사 한번 해보라고 할까요?” “응, 그래. 네가 한번 애들한테 대사 던져줘 봐.” “네.” 조연출은 먼저 나에게로 와서 건성으로 물었다. “아빠 해봐.” “아. 빠!” 나는 단번에 그 단어를 뱉었다. 악센트도 적당히 섞어서. 감독의 감탄이 여기까지 들렸다. “성국이 자알하네!” 파마머리 조연출은 진심으로 당황하는 게 보였다. “저, 감독님. 실수일지 모르니까 다시 한번 해볼게요.” “그래.” 조연출의 이마에는 이미 식은땀이 흐르고 있었다. “자, 다시 한번 해보자. 방금 뭐라고 했지?” 조연출은 아빠라는 단어를 일부러 빼고, 나를 채근했다. 이런 거에 흔들릴 내가 아니다. “아. 빠!” 이번에 더 담담하고 대범하게 아빠를 외쳤다. “하하하. 성국이 진짜 잘하네. 오케이!” 감독은 손뼉을 치며 좋아했고, 다른 스태프들 모두 숨을 죽였다. 모두 명품 백을 든 여자의 눈치를 보는 것 같았다. 감독은 조연출을 쳐다봤다. “성국이는 됐으니까, 저기 가서 해봐. 근데 얘 어머니는 누구세요?” “전데요. 이분은 보모세요.” 명품 백 든 여자가 나섰다. “두 분 중 한 분은 나가세요. 애가 도대체 집중을 못 하잖아요.” “애 아니고요. 재희요. 이재희요.” “아, 네. 이재희 어머니. 애가 보모분에게 너무 기어가니까, 두 분은 중 한 분은 나가세요.” 명품 백 여자가 눈짓을 하자 중년의 여자가 밖으로 나갔다. 하지만 이건 실수였다. 스튜디오의 문이 닫히자마자 재희는 울어재끼기 시작했다. “으아아앙. 으앙. 으아아앙!” “어머, 얘가 잘하다 왜 이래.” 명품 백을 든 여자는 오늘 처음으로 명품 백을 의자에 놓고 재희를 안았지만, 재희는 더 크게 울 뿐이었다. “으아앙. 으아아앙!” 감독은 얼굴을 손으로 벅벅 문질렀다. “애가 엄마가 누군 줄도 모르네. 그러니 아빠는 당연히 못 하지.” 당황한 조연출이 얼른 재희에게 다가갔다. “감독님, 대사 해볼게요.” “그래, 해봐라. 해봐.” 조연출은 재희를 달래느라 우스꽝스러운 표정까지 지었다. “우르르 까꿍. 재희야, 아빠 해보자. 아빠.” “으아아앙!” 재희는 더 크게 울 뿐이었다. “됐어. 그만해.” 감독이 소리를 질렀지만, 조연출은 마치 주문을 걸듯이 중얼거렸다. “재희야, 아빠. 아빠. 아빠.” “아….” 그제야 재희는 겨우 한 마디를 내뱉었다. “감독님, 아빠라고 했어요.” “됐어. 끝났어.” 감독은 화난 얼굴로 스튜디오 문을 박차고 나갔다. 드디어 내가 된 건가. 나는 징징 짜는 재희를 보며 짧은 두 손가락으로 승리의 V 자를 그렸다. * * * “죄송하게 됐습니다.” 얼굴이 빨개진 감독이 화를 참지 못하고 대기실 안을 바쁘게 오갔다. 엄마는 애잔한 눈빛으로 나를 쳐다봤다. 태어난 지 14개월 만에, 나는 처음으로 인생의 쓴맛을 보고 있었다. “이미 내정된 애였는데, 오디션은 뭐 하러 본 거야. 아, 씨X.” 감독은 욕을 하다 말고 무안한 얼굴로 나를 봤다. “성국아, 미안하다. 아저씨가 화가 많이 났어. 세상 더러운데, 이게 세상이더라고.” 나는 겸허히 받아들였다. 감독의 말대로 세상 더러운데, 그게 세상이다. 회귀 전에 내가 수없이 누군가에게 했던 짓이었다. 유력 정치인의 자식이라 직원으로 채용하고 승진시켜 주고 이런 거 눈감아준 게 한두 번이 아니었다. 그로 인해 지금의 나처럼 돈 없고 백 없는 어떤 이는 분명 불이익을 받았다. 감독은 별안간 멈춰 서더니 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “어머니, 연락처 좀 주세요.” “그건… 왜요?” “다른 광고에 일 있으면 성국이 추천할게요. 아이들 찾는 광고는 언제나 있거든요.” “아니에요. 경험 삼아 한번 와봤어요.” [사양은 이럴 때 하는 게 아니야!] 나는 옹알거렸다. 감독은 귀여워 죽겠다는 눈으로 나를 봤다. “우선 일주일 후에 촬영 있을 건데, 그때 또 나와주셔야 해요.” “왜요?” 엄마는 영문을 알 수 없는 얼굴로 물었다. “아기 모델의 경우에 보통 한두 명 정도 후보 모델을 준비하거든요. 아기 모델들이 워낙 변수가 많아서요. 갑자기 아프기도 하고, 잘하다가 말문이 막히기도 하고 그래서요.” “아, 또 와야 하는군요.” 엄마는 영 반갑지 않은 반응이었다. 감독은 얼른 덧붙였다. “오늘 오신 것도 경리부에서 조촐하게 비용 처리해드릴 거예요. 다음 주에 오시면 모델료만큼은 아니지만, 그래도 좀 비용이 나갈 거예요.” 엄마는 호박이가 든 아랫배를 가만히 만지며 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국이가 안 힘들려나….” [새로 태어난 지 얼마 안 된 장기들을 탑재한 내가 힘들 일이 뭐가 있어! 어서 한다고 해! 어서!] “이 녀석, 꼭 엄마랑 대화하는 것 같네요. 완전 카메라 체질인데, 진짜 제가 다른 광고 회사에도 추천할게요. 여기 본부장이 저 집안에 뭘 단단히 처먹었나 봐요. 미리 알았으면 저도 안 하는 건데… 성국이 어머님, 연락처 꼭 남겨주세요.” “네, 그럴게요.” “그리고 진짜 다음 주에 꼭 나오세요.” “네.” 엄마는 고개를 끄덕였다. * * * 경리 부서는 오디션장과 한 층 아래인 2층에 있었다. 엄마는 나를 안고 문을 배꼼 열고 들어갔다. 그리고 지나가는 슈트를 입은 여자를 붙잡고 물었다. “저, 오늘 오디션 본 아기인데요.” “교통비 받으시려고요?” “네.” “김 과장. 여기 교통비 드려.” 여자는 구석 자리에 앉은 여자에게 소리를 쳤다. 동시에 자리에서 일어난 건 바로 우리의 집주인인 단발머리였다. 단발머리는 봉투 하나와 서류를 들고 우리에게 다가왔다. 엄마는 급히 반색을 했다. “언니.” “나가요. 음료수 살게요.” 단발머리는 주위를 살피며 소곤거렸다. 엄마도 얼른 고개만 까딱하고 나를 안고 나갔다. 또르르. 캔 음료가 자판기에서 굴러떨어졌다. 단발머리가 시원한 캔 음료와 봉투를 내밀었다. “교통비로 5만 원 지급돼요.” “5만 원이나요?” “택시비 빼면 얼마 남지도 않잖아요.” “언니, 저희 버스 타고 왔어요.” 엄마는 속도 좋게 배시시 웃었다. “애 가진 여자가 갓 돌 지난 아기까지 안고 버스 타고 여기까지 왔어요?” “버스는 자주 타서 그런지 배 속의 호박이도 그렇고 성국이도 모두 괜찮았어요.” [나는 멀미했다고!] 단발머리는 고개를 가로젓더니 음료수 캔을 들고만 있는 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “안 마셔요?” “지금 마시면 가는 길에 화장실 가고 싶을 것 같아서요. 집에 가서 마시려고요.” “그래요, 그럼.” “언니, 다음 주 촬영 때요. 우리 성국이, 후보 모델로 나오라는데요. 그러면 얼마나 줘요?” “촬영 모델은 아니니까. 그래도 한 교통비 조로 20만 원 나올 거예요.” “그렇게나 많이요?” “이것만 됐어도 적어도 300은 벌었을 텐데, 아쉽네요. 삼전 전자 광고료는 업계에서도 가장 좋거든요.” [300이라….] 물론 내게는 전혀 큰돈이 아니지만, 엄마에게는 무척이나 큰돈일 게 분명했다. 아빠의 반년 치 월급이었다. 그제야 엄마는 아쉬운 표정을 지었다. “우리 성국이가 걔보다 더 잘했는데….” 그 표정을 단발머리가 단번에 알아챘다. “오늘 된 애가 덕풍 제지 손자라고 하더라고요. 저희 회사가 덕풍 제지 광고도 하거든요. 그거 무시 못 하잖아요.” [덕풍 제지? 그 코딱지만 한 중소기업?] 나는 어이가 없어서 콧방귀마저 나오지 않았다. 그런 하찮은 중소기업 놈한테 지다니! 더 화가 부글부글 끓었다. 이때, 지나가던 중년의 남자가 단발머리를 쳐다봤다. “김 과장, 근무시간에 왜 여기 있어?” “죄송합니다. 곧 들어가요.” “에이, 저러니 만년 과장이지.” 남자의 말에 엄마는 음료수를 가방에 밀어 넣고는 단발머리에게 인사를 했다. “언니, 어서 들어가요. 저 가볼게요.” “네.” 단발머리는 조금 붉어진 얼굴을 숨기며 다시 경리부로 들어갔다. * * * “여기 앉으세요.” “감사합니다.” 건장해 보이는 학생의 양보로 엄마는 만원 버스에서 자리를 잡았다. 엄마는 자리에 앉자마자 창문을 살짝 열었다. 그리고 내 엉덩이를 도닥였다. “성국아, 택시보다 더 좋다. 이 큰 버스가 우리 집 앞까지 가잖아.” [이런 걸 근본 없는 낙천주의라고 하는 건가. 난 가난해본 적 없어 모르겠는데.] “성국아, 우리 들어가는 길에 치킨 사가자.” [그건 엄마가 먹고 싶은 거고. 난 아직 치아도 제대로 안 나서 치킨 못 뜯는다고 몇 번을 말해.] “참, 우리 성국이는 바나나 사줘야지.” [그래, 그걸로 만족하지. 오디션도 떨어졌으니….] 나는 하품을 늘어지게 하고 눈을 스르륵 감았다. 회귀 전에는 대중교통이라는 것을 단 한 번도 이용해본 적이 없었다. 내 전용 자동차는 대한민국에 한 대밖에 없는 방탄유리로 제작된 고급 자동차였다. 전용 기사 역시 20년 경력의 베테랑이었다. 코너를 돌 때 손에 든 커피조차 흔들리지 않았었는데…. 근데, 이 덜컹거리는 버스에서 잠이 쏟아지다니…. 내가 말이야… 대한민국 재계의 카리스마 전성국이 말이야…. * * * 눈을 떴을 때는 이미 이불 속이었다. 옆으로 엄마가 사온 치킨과 바나나가 보였다. 막 샤워를 마친 아빠가 나오자 엄마가 작은 상을 펴고는 치킨을 올렸다. 어느새 아빠도 퇴근을 하고 온 모양이었다. “자기야, 우리 성국이가 오늘 5만 원이나 벌었어.” “우리 성국이 대견한데. 근데 프라이드치킨이야? 자기 양념치킨 좋아하잖아. 그거 사지.” “오늘은 시장표 치킨 먹고 싶었어. 그리고 이거.” 엄마는 아빠에게 단발머리가 뽑아준 음료수를 내밀었다. “자기 좋아하는 포도 셰이커.” “이것도 샀어?” “나 오늘 돈 좀 썼지.” [저러려고 음료수 챙겼구만.] 엄마는 행복한 표정을 지었다. “소영아, 너 마실 거는?” “나는 임신 중이잖아. 물이면 족해.” “이거 나눠 마시자.” [그래, 콩 한쪽도 나눠 먹어라. 실컷.] 나는 살짝 몸을 뒤척였다. 그러자 엄마가 얼른 나를 살폈다. “성국아, 깼어?” 깨긴 했는데, 다시 미친 듯이 졸음이 쏟아졌다. 나는 다시 눈을 끔뻑거렸다. “소영아, 내가 성국이 재울게. 어서 치킨 먹어.” “자기 피곤하잖아.” “오늘은 니가 더 피곤하지. 임신한 몸으로 이태원까지 갔다 왔잖아. 어서 먹어.” “알았어. 오늘만 내가 먼저 먹을게.” 아빠가 다가와서 내 배를 도닥였다. 막 샤워를 마친 아빠에게서 기분 좋은 비누 냄새가 났다. 아빠는 행복한 얼굴로 나를 내려다보며 속삭였다. “우리 성국이 오늘 큰일 했어.” [앞으로 더 큰 일 할 테니, 놀라지나 마라.] “으아함!” 나는 마지막으로 입이 찢어지게 하품을 하고 눈을 감았다. * * * 작은 봉고가 도착한 곳은 산속에 위치한 스튜디오였다. 봉고가 도착하자 문이 열리며 스태프들이 줄줄이 내렸다. 저번의 파마머리 조연출이 우리를 알아보고는 다가왔다. “후보 모델은 대기실에서 기다리시면 돼요. 호출 없으면 이따 5시에 나가는 봉고 타고 가시면 됩니다.” “아, 네.” “참, 오늘 오신 비용은 회사 도착하시면 경리부에서 받아 가세요.” “네.” 엄마는 연신 네만 하고 대기실로 들어갔다. 대기실에는 이미 도착해서 촬영 준비 중인 덕풍 제지 손자 재희가 있었다. 재희는 오늘도 여전히 멍청해 보였다. 재희의 엄마는 우리 엄마를 위아래로 보더니 귀찮은 듯 손가락으로 지시했다. “재희가 오늘 예민해요. 신경 안 쓰이게 구석에 있어요.” [저게 지금 어따 대고 지시야?]","completion":"Episode 5 The final audition had a somewhat unique structure. It involved placing my baby and the luxury bag lady's baby on the studio floor and seeing how well they could speak and adapt to the filming environment while the camera was rolling. This was the first real competition I faced in this life! Fortunately, it seemed the director was indifferent to this mock-up, so I had to somehow catch the director's eye. With a serious face, the director looked at the screen and shouted. \\"Okay, start!\\" The camera began to roll. I naturally crawled around the studio floor, grinning. Of course, I made sure to crawl in a way that would look best on camera. In contrast, the luxury bag lady's child crawled towards a middle-aged woman, already full of irritation on his face. [Tsk, tsk.] I shook my head in disapproval. I could feel the director looking at me with satisfaction. The assistant director with permed hair quickly intervened. \\"Director, shall we have them try saying a line?\\" \\"Yes, go ahead. Throw a line to the kids.\\" \\"Okay.\\" The assistant director first came to me and asked half-heartedly. \\"Say 'Daddy.'\\" \\"Da. Ddy!\\" I blurted out the word in one go, mixing in the right accent. The director's admiration reached me. \\"Sung-guk is doing really well!\\" The permed hair assistant director looked genuinely flustered. \\"Uh, Director. It might have been a mistake, so let's try one more time.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Sweat was already running down the assistant director's forehead. \\"Let's try again. What did you just say?\\" The assistant director deliberately left out the word 'Daddy' and urged me on. I'm not one to be shaken by such things. \\"Da. Ddy!\\" This time, I called out 'Daddy' even more calmly and boldly. \\"Hahaha. Sung-guk is really good at this. Okay!\\" The director clapped his hands in delight, and all the other staff held their breath. It seemed like everyone was watching the luxury bag lady's reaction. The director looked at the assistant director. \\"Sung-guk is fine, so go try over there. But who is this child's mother?\\" \\"It's me. This lady is the nanny.\\" The luxury bag lady stepped forward. \\"One of you should leave. The child can't concentrate at all.\\" \\"It's not a child, it's Jae-hee. Lee Jae-hee.\\" \\"Ah, yes. Lee Jae-hee's mother. Since the child keeps crawling to the nanny, one of you should leave.\\" At the luxury bag lady's signal, the middle-aged woman left. But this was a mistake. As soon as the studio door closed, Jae-hee began to cry. \\"Waaah. Waaah. Waaah!\\" \\"Oh my, why is he acting like this now?\\" For the first time today, the luxury bag lady put down her luxury bag on a chair and picked up Jae-hee, but he only cried louder. \\"Waaah. Waaah!\\" The director rubbed his face with his hands. \\"The child doesn't even know who his mother is. No wonder he can't say 'Daddy.'\\" The flustered assistant director quickly approached Jae-hee. \\"Director, let's try saying a line.\\" \\"Go ahead, try.\\" The assistant director made a ridiculous face to soothe Jae-hee. \\"Boo boo peekaboo. Jae-hee, say 'Daddy.' Daddy.\\" \\"Waaah!\\" Jae-hee only cried louder. \\"That's enough. Stop.\\" The director yelled, but the assistant director muttered as if casting a spell. \\"Jae-hee, Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.\\" \\"Ah...\\" Finally, Jae-hee barely uttered a word. \\"Director, he said 'Daddy.'\\" \\"That's enough. It's over.\\" The director stormed out of the studio with an angry face. Did I finally make it? I looked at the whining Jae-hee and made a victory V sign with my short fingers. * * * \\"I'm sorry about this.\\" The director, his face red, couldn't contain his anger and paced back and forth in the waiting room. My mother looked at me with a pitiful gaze. At 14 months old, I was tasting the bitterness of life for the first time. \\"We had already decided on the child, so what was the point of the audition? Ah, shit.\\" The director cursed and then looked at me with an embarrassed face. \\"Sung-guk, I'm sorry. I'm really angry. The world is filthy, and that's just how it is.\\" I humbly accepted it. As the director said, the world is filthy, and that's just how it is. Before my regression, I had done countless things to others. Hiring and promoting the child of a powerful politician, turning a blind eye to such things wasn't rare. Because of that, someone like me now, without money or backing, definitely suffered disadvantages. Suddenly, the director stopped and looked at my mother. \\"Mother, please give me your contact information.\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"If there's another commercial, I'll recommend Sung-guk. There's always a demand for child models.\\" \\"No, thank you. We just came for the experience.\\" [You shouldn't refuse in situations like this!] I babbled. The director looked at me with eyes full of adoration. \\"Anyway, there's a shoot next week, and you'll have to come again.\\" \\"Why?\\" My mother asked, not understanding the situation. \\"In the case of baby models, we usually prepare one or two backup models. Baby models are so unpredictable. They can suddenly get sick, or even if they're doing well, they might suddenly stop talking, so...\\" \\"Oh, we have to come again.\\" My mother didn't seem too pleased. The director quickly added. \\"Even coming today will be modestly compensated by the accounting department. If you come next week, it won't be as much as the model fee, but there will still be some compensation.\\" My mother gently touched her pregnant belly and looked at me. \\"I wonder if Sung-guk will be okay...\\" [With these newly born organs, what could possibly tire me out! Hurry up and agree! Hurry!] \\"This kid, he really seems like he's talking with his mom. He's totally camera material, I'll recommend him to other advertising agencies too. Here, the director must have been fed something solid by that family. If I had known, I wouldn't have done it... Sung-guk's mom, please leave your contact information.\\" \\"Okay, I will.\\" \\"And really, make sure to come next week.\\" \\"Okay.\\" My mother nodded. * * * The accounting department was located one floor below the audition room, on the second floor. My mother, holding me, slightly opened the door and entered. She then stopped a woman in a suit passing by and asked. \\"We're here for the baby audition today.\\" \\"Are you here to receive the transportation fee?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Manager Kim. Give them the transportation fee here.\\" The woman shouted towards a woman sitting in the corner. At the same time, the woman who stood up was our landlord with short hair. The short-haired landlord approached us with an envelope and some documents. My mother quickly brightened up. \\"Sister.\\" \\"Let's go out. I'll buy you a drink.\\" The short-haired landlord whispered, glancing around. My mother quickly nodded and left with me in her arms. The can of drink rolled out of the vending machine. The short-haired landlord handed me the cool can of drink and the envelope. \\"You'll receive 50,000 won for transportation.\\" \\"50,000 won?\\" \\"Subtracting the taxi fare, it's not much left.\\" \\"Sister, we took the bus here.\\" My mother smiled slyly. \\"You mean to tell me a pregnant woman with a baby just over a year old took the bus all the way here?\\" \\"We take the bus often, so both the baby in my belly and Sung-guk were fine.\\" [I got motion sickness!] The short-haired landlord shook her head and then looked at my mother, who was still holding the can of drink. \\"Aren't you going to drink it?\\" \\"I'll drink it on the way home. I might need to use the bathroom if I drink it now.\\" \\"Alright, then.\\" \\"Sister, about next week's shoot. They said Sung-guk should come as a backup model. How much will they pay?\\" \\"Since he's not the main model, it'll be about 200,000 won for transportation.\\" \\"That much?\\" \\"If he had been the main model, he would have earned at least 300,000 won. Samsung Electronics' commercial fees are the best in the industry.\\" [300,000 won...] Of course, it wasn't a lot of money to me, but it was certainly a significant amount for my mother. It was half a year's salary for my father. Only then did my mother show a hint of regret. \\"Sung-guk did better than that kid...\\" The short-haired landlord caught on immediately. \\"I heard today's chosen child is the grandson of Deokpoong Paper. Our company also handles Deokpoong Paper's advertisements. We can't ignore that.\\" [Deokpoong Paper? That tiny mid-sized company?] I was so dumbfounded I couldn't even snort in disdain. To lose to a nobody from such an insignificant mid-sized company! My anger boiled even more. At that moment, a middle-aged man passing by looked at the short-haired landlord. \\"Manager Kim, why are you here during work hours?\\" \\"Sorry, I'll go back in now.\\" \\"See, that's why you're stuck as a manager forever.\\" At the man's words, my mother quickly put the drink in her bag and greeted the short-haired landlord. \\"Sister, go back in. I'll be going now.\\" \\"Okay.\\" The short-haired landlord, her face slightly red, went back into the accounting department. * * * \\"Please, take a seat.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Thanks to a robust student giving up his seat, my mother found a place to sit on the crowded bus. As soon as she sat down, she slightly opened the window and patted my bottom. \\"Sung-guk, this is even better than a taxi. This big bus takes us right in front of our house.\\" [Is this what they call baseless optimism? I've never been poor, so I wouldn't know.] \\"Sung-guk, let's buy some chicken on our way home.\\" [That's what you want to eat. I can't even chew chicken yet, no matter how many times I tell you.] \\"Right, we should buy some bananas for Sung-guk.\\" [Yeah, settle for that. We failed the audition anyway...] I yawned widely and slowly closed my eyes. I had never used public transportation before my regression. My personal car was the only one in South Korea made with bulletproof glass. My chauffeur was a veteran with 20 years of experience. Even when turning corners, the coffee in my hand never spilled... But to fall asleep on this bumpy bus... Me... The charismatic Jeon Seong-guk of South Korea's business world... * * * When I woke up, I was already in bed. Next to me, there were chicken and bananas that my mother had bought. My father, who had just finished showering, came out, and my mother set up a small table and placed the chicken on it. It seemed my father had also come home from work. \\"Honey, our Sung-guk earned 50,000 won today.\\" \\"Our Sung-guk is admirable. But is it fried chicken? You like seasoned chicken, don't you? You should have bought that.\\" \\"Today, I wanted to eat market-style chicken. And this.\\" My mother handed my father the drink the short-haired landlord had given her. \\"Your favorite grape shake.\\" \\"You bought this too?\\" \\"I spent some money today.\\" [So that's why you kept the drink.] My mother looked happy. \\"So-young, what will you drink?\\" \\"I'm pregnant, so water is enough for me.\\" \\"Let's share this.\\" [Yeah, share even a bean. Enjoy.] I slightly shifted my position. Then, my mother quickly checked on me. \\"Sung-guk, are you awake?\\" I was awake, but an overwhelming sleepiness poured over me again. I blinked my eyes slowly. \\"So-young, I'll put Sung-guk to sleep. You go ahead and eat.\\" \\"You're tired, honey.\\" \\"You're more tired today. You went all the way to Itaewon with a pregnant body. Go ahead and eat.\\" \\"Okay, I'll eat first today.\\" My father approached and patted my belly. He had a pleasant smell of soap after his shower. Looking down at me with a happy face, my father whispered. \\"Our Sung-guk did a great job today.\\" [I'll do even greater things in the future, so don't be surprised.] \\"Yawn!\\" I yawned one last time, stretching my mouth wide, and closed my eyes. * * * The small van arrived at a studio located in the mountains. As the van arrived, the door opened, and the staff filed out. The permed hair assistant director from last time recognized us and approached. \\"Backup models should wait in the waiting room. If there's no call, you can leave on the 5 p.m. van.\\" \\"Ah, okay.\\" \\"Also, you'll receive today's compensation at the company's accounting department when you arrive.\\" \\"Okay.\\" My mother kept saying okay and entered the waiting room. In the waiting room, Jae-hee from Deokpoong Paper, who had already arrived and was preparing for the shoot, was there. Jae-hee still looked as clueless as ever today. Jae-hee's mother looked us up and down and then, annoyed, gestured with her finger. \\"Jae-hee is sensitive today. Stay out of the way in the corner.\\" [Is she giving orders now?]"},{"prompt":"se tiene una actibvidad cuyo nombre es: \\"Desarrollo de una herramienta predictiva para estimar la viscosidad de mezclas multi-componentes en crudos pesados considerando la optimización de la cantidad de diluyentes a utilizar para el caso de crudos venezolanos\\" y la meta asociada a dicha actividad es: \\"Realizar una búsqueda exhaustiva y crítica de literatura científica sobre viscosidad en crudos pesados y diluyentes en Venezuela, identificando metodologías existentes, limitaciones y áreas de mejora.\\" Redacta en un parrafo de no mas de 250 caracteres la meta y mejora el enunciado, haciendo notar el carácter cuantificable de la meta, incluye en la misma la revisión de correlaciones no empíricas y el uso de técnicas de predicción basado redes neuronales y técnicas similares","completion":"Realizar una revisión exhaustiva y crítica de la literatura científica sobre viscosidad en crudos pesados y diluyentes en Venezuela, identificando metodologías existentes, limitaciones y áreas de mejora, incluyendo el análisis de correlaciones no empíricas y el uso de técnicas de predicción basadas en redes neuronales para mejorar la optimización de la cantidad de diluyentes a utilizar en crudos venezolanos."},{"prompt":"resume:\\"Revisión y analisis de literatura científica sobre determinacion de viscosidad en crudos pesados y uso de diluyentes, identificando metodologías existentes, limitaciones y áreas de mejora, incluyendo el análisis de correlaciones no empíricas y el uso de técnicas de predicción basadas en redes neuronales para mejorar la optimización de la cantidad de diluyentes a utilizar en crudos venezolanos.\\"","completion":"Revisión crítica de literatura científica sobre viscosidad en crudos pesados y diluyentes en Venezuela, identificando metodologías, limitaciones y áreas de mejora, con énfasis en correlaciones no empíricas y técnicas de predicción basadas en redes neuronales para optimizar el uso de diluyentes."},{"prompt":"en base a lo anteiror, cual podria ser el producto esperado para la meta, considerando un mes de trabajo","completion":"Un informe detallado que presente una revisión exhaustiva y crítica de la literatura científica sobre viscosidad en crudos pesados y diluyentes en Venezuela, identificando metodologías existentes, limitaciones y áreas de mejora, así como un análisis de correlaciones no empíricas y el uso de técnicas de predicción basadas en redes neuronales para optimizar el uso de diluyentes en crudos venezolanos."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[오랜만이야, 선미 누나.] 임선미가 나를 보곤 환하게 미소 지으며 다가왔다. “네가 오늘 모델이구나. 어쩜 이렇게 이쁘게 생겼니.” 임선미가 나를 안아 들려고 하자, 재희 엄마가 몸으로 가로막았다. “걔는 후보고요. 오늘 주인공은 우리 재희라고요.” 재희의 엄마는 두 눈을 멍하게 끔뻑이는 자신의 아들을 임선미에게 내밀었다. 임선미는 재희를 안아 들고는 애써 미소를 지었다. “어머, 너도 예쁘네.” 아버지는 임선미에 대해서 여러 이야기를 해주셨는데, 이런 이야기를 한 적도 있었다. “코 수술을 여러 번 해서 그쪽 만지는 거 엄청 싫어해.” 삼전 그룹의 초대 회장이자 창립주인 전주신. 그 뒤를 이은 게 나의 아버지였던 전재형 회장이었다. 철의 여인 속을 평생 썩인 아버지답게 은퇴하는 그 시점까지 이름난 여배우부터 근본도 알 수 없는 여자들까지 수없이 많은 여자들과 시간을 보냈다. 그중에 임선미도 있었다. 임선미로 말할 것 같으면 10대 후반에서 20대 초반에 전성기를 맞고 그 이후로는 주춤했던 배우다. 하지만 다시 30대 초반에 감성 연기로 각종 영화제에서 상을 받으며 다시 전성기를 맞았다. 물론 그 전성기 뒤에는 아버지 전재형 부회장이 있었다. 내가 이걸 어떻게 다 알까? 아무리 회귀 전이라고 해도 1992년이라면 겨우 열 살이 된 나이인데. 세상 사람들은 재벌 대표가 어떤 사람인지 잘 모른다. 아는 거라고 해봤자 겨우 TV 드라마에 나온 판타지 같은 모습이거나, 희화된 캐릭터일 뿐이다. 아버지 전재형 대표는 삼전 그룹의 경영자로서는 훌륭했다. 위기 때마다 회사를 크게 구조 조정하고, 특성 분야에 대한 투자를 아끼지 않았다. 사원 복지와 연봉도 다른 기업에 비해 월등히 좋아서 10년 연속 일하고 싶은 회사에 꼽히기도 했다. 이런 대외적인 이미지와 달리 아버지와 남자로서 전재형은 쓰레기였다. 내가 아버지와 달리 여자관계에 있어서만은 유독 철벽을 친 이유도 그 때문이다. 아버지는 종종 우리를 앞에 두고도 노골적으로 만나는 연예인들 얘기를 해댔다. “니들 임선미 알지?” “네, 아빠. 선미 누나 진짜 예뻐요.” 그때 나는 TV에 나오는 청초한 이미지의 임선미를 무척 좋아했다. 어린 나이지만 임선미의 광고나 연기를 볼 때면 가슴이 설레기도 했다. “이쁘긴 한데 말이야. 코 수술을 여러 번 해서 그쪽 만지는 거 엄청 싫어해.” “아빠가 그걸 어떻게 아세요?” 나는 순진하게 물었고, 아빠는 알 수 없는 미소를 지으며 나를 봤다. “성국아, 너도 이 아빠 자리에 오르게 되면 다 알 수 있어. 알았지?” “…….” 열 살의 나는 무슨 말인지 알 수 없었지만, 고개를 끄덕였다. * * * 지금 내 눈앞에는 임선미가 재희를 안고 서 있었다. 재희는 조금 짜증이 난 듯 온몸으로 바동거렸다. 임선미는 애써 웃고 있었지만, 얼굴을 잔뜩 뒤로 밀고 미간을 찌푸린 채였다. 콧등을 두꺼운 메이크업으로 가린 것을 보니 수술을 한 지 얼마 안 된 모양이다. “오늘 촬영은 나랑 친해져야 하는데. 애가 낯을 가리나 봐요, 어머님.” “촬영장이 낯설어서 그럴 거예요. 제가 좀 달래볼게요.” 그 말이 떨어지자마자 보모가 일어나서 재희를 안았다. 그제야 재희는 진정됐지만, 여전히 얼굴엔 불만이 가득해 보였다. 나는 어떻게 재희가 임선미의 코를 한 대 팍 쳐버릴 수 있을지 고심에 들어갔다. [말귀가 통하는 놈은 아닐 거고….] 똑. 똑. 대기실 문이 열리면서 익숙한 얼굴이 고개를 들이밀었다. 바로 양 비서였다. 나를 모시던 양 비서의 아버지 양 비서. 양 비서 집안은 할아버지 때부터 우리 집안의 자질구레한 대소사를 정리하는 역할을 해왔다. 특히 양 비서 아저씨는 나를 무척이나 귀여워해 주셨다. 나는 반가운 마음에 소리쳤다. [양 비서 아저씨! 저예요!] 양 비서 아저씨는 나를 얼핏 보더니 미소를 지었다. “아기가 낯도 안 가리고 잘 웃네요.” “저희 애가 좀 순해요.” 엄마는 감사하다며 고개까지 숙였다. 잠깐, 양 비서 아저씨가 왔다는 것은 아버지가 움직인다는 의미인데? 나는 열린 문틈으로 서 있는 사람을 단번에 확인했다. 큰 키에 늘 단정한 옷차림. 2 대 8 가르마로 단정히 빗어 넘긴 머리. 중년의 나이에도 뱃살 하나 없었고, 자세는 꼿꼿했다. 바로 나의 아버지 전재형이었다. [아버지! 아버지!] 나는 한 손으로 몸을 지탱하며 손까지 흔들었다. 엄마가 나를 얼른 안아 들었다. “성국아, 사람들 많으니까 좋지? 앞으로 엄마가 자주 데리고 나올게.” [하아. 이게 아닌데….] 지금 나의 외침과 몸짓은 이들에게 그저 재롱일 뿐이다. 양 비서 아저씨는 임선미에게 뭐라고 말하더니 같이 대기실이 빠져나갔다. [오늘이 그날이구나….] 내가 임선미를 좋아한단 사실을 알고 아버지가 임선미의 광고 촬영장에 나를 데리고 간 적이 있었다. 아버지는 나를 임선미에게 소개해줬다. 임선미는 내 뺨을 몇 번 손으로 어루만져 주고는 아버지와 사라져서 잠시 후에 화장이 지워진 얼굴로 나타났다. 그사이 나는 촬영장에서 양 비서 아저씨와 공놀이를 하며 시간을 보냈다. 곧 대기실 문이 열리더니 파마머리 조연출이 난처한 얼굴로 들어왔다. “사모님, 촬영이 조금 지연될 것 같습니다.” “우리 재희 곧 밥 먹고 잠들 시간인데, 그 시간 맞춰 준다면서요?” “죄송합니다. 그게, 임선미 씨가 약간 컨디션이 안 좋아서요.” [어디서 거짓말을….] 임선미는 아버지의 차 뒷좌석에서 한창 바쁠 때였다. 아버지가 좀 급하시니까 길지는 않을 것이다. 나는 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. 중년의 보모가 잠시 재희를 내 옆에 내려놨다. “사모님, 저 화장실 급히 다녀올게요. 재희 좀 봐주세요.” “화장실 다녀오는 시간은 급여에서 까든지 해야지. 어서 다녀와요.” “죄송합니다.” 보모가 화장실에 간 사이에도 사모님은 손가락 하나 까딱하지 않았다. 조연출은 눈치를 보며 슬금슬금 나갔고, 엄마와 나는 어색한 기류 속에서 조용히 앉아 있었다. 내 옆 소파에 앉은 재희는 한눈에도 무기력해 보였다. 말이나 걸어볼까? 비슷한 나이이니 말이 통할지도 모른다. [야, 너 촬영하기 싫지?] 의외로 재빨리 재희가 응답했다. “응애. 응. 응어웅응어웅.” [뭐지? 대충 알아듣겠는데….] 나는 놀란 얼굴로 재희를 쳐다봤다. 재희는 연신 불만을 옹알거렸다. [그래, 어서 다 말해봐!] 요약하자면 조명이 너무 뜨겁고 따가워서 촬영하기 싫다는 거였다. 사람들이 이렇게 해라 저렇게 해라 하는 것도 짜증 난단 말도 했다. 심지어 지금은 배도 고프고 졸리다는 내용이었다. 귀하게 자란 도련님은 이런 일이 귀찮은 모양이었다. 추억이야 다 자란 후에나 생기는 거지, 지금 당장은 이런 먼지 폴폴 날리는 촬영 현장이 싫을 만도 하다. 상대방이 싫어하는 것을 처리해주는 것. 그거야말로 비즈니스 관계에서 신임을 얻는 방법이었다. 나는 임선미의 약점을 그대로 재희에게 알려줬다. [아까 그 누나 코 때려. 그 누나, 코가 약점이야. 아마 한 방이면 너 촬영 안 해도 될 거야.] “응애?” [당연히 진짜지. 걱정 말고 있는 힘껏 때려버려.] “응애.” 재희는 격하게 고개를 끄덕였다. “아이고, 둘이 사이가 좋네. 무슨 이야기를 그렇게 했어?” 돌아온 중년의 보모가 재희를 안아 들었다. * * * “촬영 곧 시작합니다.” 조연출이 헐레벌떡 뛰어와서 소리쳤다. 재희는 준비를 마치고 엄마와 보모를 대동하고 촬영장으로 향했다. 나는 재희에게 마지막 말을 건넸다. [파이팅!] “응애!” 재희는 있는 힘껏 답해줬다. 나는 슬슬 재희가 마음에 들기 시작했다. 부잣집에서 자라서 심기가 뒤틀리는 일은 하기 싫은 게 분명했다. [저런 녀석이 가난한 집에 태어나서 나 대신 개고생 좀 해야 하는데….] 순간 엄마의 손이 훅 들어와서 내 배를 도닥였다. 내가 가장 좋아하는 엄마의 기술이었다. 엄마가 이렇게 손으로 내 배를 도닥이면 근심 걱정이 모두 한순간에 날아가고, 마냥 행복했다. “성국아, 오늘 촬영 못 해도 네 덕분에 엄마도 좋은 구경 하고 정말 좋아. 엄마가 임선미도 봤잖아. 성국아, 엄마가 진짜 많이 사랑해.” 엄마는 내 볼에 뽀뽀를 퍼부었다. 울컥. 이번 생에서는 진짜 감정 조절이 너무 안 됐다. 겨우 사랑해란 말에 울컥하다니. 회귀 전에는 사랑해란 말을 제대로 들어본 적이 없었다. 모두들 나에게 사랑한다는 말보다는 존경한다는 말을 많이 했다. 그때는 그게 좋은 줄 알았다. 나는 엄마에게 손을 내밀었다. 그러자 엄마는 볼록 나온 배 위로 나를 안아 올렸다. “엄마는 우리 성국이가 제일 이쁜 거 같은데… 여기 아저씨들은 아닌가 봐. 그래도 감독님이 여기저기 추천해 주신다고 약속하셨으니까, 우리 또 기회가 있겠지?” [기회는 기다리는 게 아니라 만드는 거야, 엄마.] “그래, 그래. 우리 성국이도 엄마랑 기다리자.” 나는 고개를 도리도리 흔들었다. 그 순간, 대기실 문이 열리더니 파마머리 조연출이 급히 뛰어 들어왔다. “저기요. 준비하세요.” “네?” 엄마가 놀라 되물었다. “촬영 준비하라고요! 말귀도 못 알아들어요?” “우리 성국이가 찍는 거예요?” “아, 그렇다고요.” [이게 어디서 짜증이야?] 아무래도 저 녀석은 기억해둬야 할 것 같았다. 곧 스태프들이 들이닥치더니 나에게 재희가 입었던 내복을 입히고 촬영장으로 안고 뛰어갔다. 임선미가 잔뜩 화난 얼굴로 화장을 고치는 게 보였다. 그 옆으로는 똑같이 화가 난 재희의 엄마가 서 있었다. “아니, 한 번 더 기회를 달라는데 그걸 못 줘요? 네?” 재희의 엄마는 감독에게 따지듯이 묻고 있었다. “지금 벌써 1시간이나 기회를 줬는데 똑같잖아요. 애가 말을 안 듣고, 여자 모델 얼굴을 손으로 퍽퍽 치는데 어쩌라고요? 오늘 안에 촬영 끝내야 해요. 이대로라면 내일도 못 찍는다고요!” “내가 우리 아버님한테 당장 전화 걸 거예요.” “거세요! 나도 안 해, 이 광고!” 감독은 화가 난 얼굴로 버럭 소리를 질렀다. 그 바람에 재희는 울음까지 터트렸고, 촬영장은 난장판이 됐다. 재희의 사모님은 벽돌 사이즈의 핸드폰을 들더니 어디론가 전화를 걸었다. 이때였다. 화장을 고치던 임선미가 저벅저벅 걸어가더니 핸드폰을 빼앗아 들었다. “뭐 하는 짓이야? 모델 주제에.” “지금 우리가 어디 광고 찍는 줄 알지?” “감히 어디서 반말이야?” 재희의 엄마는 독하게 임선미를 몰아붙였다. 하지만 임선미도 만만치 않았다. “네가 반말했으니, 나도 하는 거지. 덕풍 제지 사모님. 사모님으로 대접해줄 때 제대로 했어야지. 애가 말을 더럽게 안 듣는 데다가 재능도 없는데 어쩌자고?” “이게… 야!” 재희 엄마의 손이 올라가자마자 임선미가 재희 엄마의 손을 탁 잡았다. 촬영장은 순식간에 조용해졌다. 나 역시 넋을 놓고 봤다. 임선미는 주위를 한 번 휙 보더니 재희 엄마를 똑똑히 쳐다봤다. “부잣집에 태어나서 시집 잘 가 세상이 만만한가 본데, 여기 그런 곳 아니야. 재능 없으면 찬물이나 마시고 집에 가시지. 이 자리는 재능 있는 사람이 자리를 차지하는 게 맞는 거지. 안 그래?” “이 손 안 놔? 너, 삼전 그룹 부회장 스폰 받는 거 다 알아. 그래서 삼전 전자 전속 모델 하는 거면서. 넌 뭐 그렇게 당당해?” [오호, 사모님도 센데.] 나와 엄마는 손을 꼭 잡고 흥미진진하게 두 여자의 대결을 지켜봤다. “그럼 잘 알겠네. 내 뒤에는 삼전 그룹이 있는데, 겨우 중소기업 며느리 주제에 어디서 깝쳐?” “…….” 나는 하마터면 손뼉까지 칠 뻔했다. 중소기업 며느리 주제에 어디서 깝쳐! 내가 해주고픈 말이었다. 이 광경을 보고 있던 감독과 스태프들 모두 너무 놀라 입조차 뻥끗 못 하고 있었다. 임선미는 재희 엄마의 손을 한 번에 확 뿌리쳤다. 그리고 감독에게 걸어갔다. “감독님, 후보 모델이랑 촬영 시작하죠. 저 내일은 영화 촬영 있어서 시간 안 돼요. 아까 대기실에서 보니까 후보 모델이 훨씬 이쁘고 낯도 안 가리더라고요. 저 아줌마가 뭐라고 하면 제가 삼전 부회장님한테 전화 한 통 할 테니까, 그냥 무시하고 촬영 시작하죠. 어디 돈 좀 먹였나 본데, 삼전 그룹 회장님한테 돈 먹인 거 아닌 이상 내가 다 알아서 해줄게요.” “오케이. 촬영 시작합시다. 성국이 준비됐지?” 감독이 나를 쳐다봤다. 나는 번쩍 손을 들었다. [준비 완료!]","completion":"Episode 6 As I babbled on, my mom picked me up. \\"Sung-guk, are you sleepy?\\" It's another way of telling me to stay quiet. Is this what life is like for the weak? Being pushed around in competitions that never work out, receiving unfair treatment, and not even being able to rebel. I sighed. Maybe this was the life I had to get used to in this lifetime. Click. The door opened, and a familiar woman came in with a smile. I recognized her at a glance. Im Seon-mi. She was currently the top actress in South Korea, especially known for her tear-jerking melodramatic performances. And I knew a secret about Im Seon-mi. She was in a sponsorship relationship with Jeon Jae-hyung, the vice chairman of Samjeon Group and my father. I slightly lifted the corners of my mouth as I looked at Im Seon-mi. [Long time no see, Seon-mi noona.] Im Seon-mi smiled brightly as she approached me. \\"You're the model today. How did you get so pretty?\\" As Im Seon-mi tried to pick me up, Jae-hee's mom blocked her with her body. \\"He's just a candidate. The star today is our Jae-hee.\\" Jae-hee's mom pushed her son, who was blinking dumbly, towards Im Seon-mi. Im Seon-mi picked up Jae-hee and forced a smile. \\"Oh, you're pretty too.\\" My father had told me various stories about Im Seon-mi, including this one. \\"She hates it when people touch her nose because she's had several nose surgeries.\\" Jeon Ju-shin, the founding chairman of Samjeon Group. My father, Jeon Jae-hyung, followed in his footsteps. True to his nickname as the \\"Iron Lady,\\" my father spent his life surrounded by countless women, from famous actresses to women of unknown origins, until he retired. Im Seon-mi was among them. Speaking of Im Seon-mi, she was an actress who peaked in her late teens to early twenties and then saw a decline, only to hit a new peak in her early thirties with her emotional acting, winning various film festival awards. Of course, Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was behind her resurgence. How do I know all this? Even if it's before my regression, in 1992, I was only ten years old. People don't really know what a chaebol representative is like. All they know is the fantasy-like image from TV dramas or caricatured characters. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was an excellent manager for Samjeon Group. He restructured the company during crises and didn't hesitate to invest in specialized areas. Employee welfare and salaries were significantly better than other companies, making it the most desired workplace for ten consecutive years. Despite this public image, Jeon Jae-hyung, as a father and a man, was trash. That's why I was particularly strict about relationships with women, unlike my father. My father often talked openly about the celebrities he was seeing, even in front of us. \\"Do you guys know Im Seon-mi?\\" \\"Yes, dad. Seon-mi noona is really pretty.\\" At that time, I really liked the pure image of Im Seon-mi on TV. Even at a young age, my heart fluttered when I saw her commercials or acting. \\"She's pretty, but you know, she hates it when people touch her nose because she's had several nose surgeries.\\" \\"How do you know that, dad?\\" I asked innocently, and my dad looked at me with an indescribable smile. \\"Sung-guk, when you take over this position, you'll understand everything. Got it?\\" \\"......\\" At ten years old, I didn't understand what he meant, but I nodded. * * * Now, Im Seon-mi was standing in front of me, holding Jae-hee. Jae-hee seemed a bit annoyed and squirmed with his whole body. Im Seon-mi was trying to smile, but her face was pulled back, and her brows were furrowed. It seemed she had recently had nose surgery, judging by the thick makeup covering her nose bridge. \\"Today's shoot requires getting along with me. The kid seems shy around strangers, ma'am.\\" \\"It's probably because the shooting set is unfamiliar. I'll try to soothe him.\\" As soon as those words were spoken, the nanny stood up and took Jae-hee. Jae-hee finally calmed down, but his face still looked dissatisfied. I began to ponder how Jae-hee could possibly punch Im Seon-mi's nose. [He doesn't seem like he'd understand if I just told him...] Knock. Knock. The door to the waiting room opened, and a familiar face peeked in. It was Secretary Yang. Secretary Yang, who served me, was the son of Secretary Yang's father. The Yang family had been handling trivial matters for our family since my grandfather's time. Especially, Secretary Yang's father was very fond of me. I shouted with joy. [Secretary Yang, uncle! It's me!] Secretary Yang glanced at me and smiled. \\"The baby doesn't seem shy and smiles well.\\" \\"Our child is quite gentle.\\" My mom bowed her head in gratitude. Wait, if Secretary Yang is here, does that mean my father is making a move? I immediately recognized the person standing in the doorway. Tall stature, always neatly dressed. Hair neatly combed in a 2:8 parting. Despite being middle-aged, he had no belly fat, and his posture was upright. It was my father, Jeon Jae-hyung. [Father! Father!] I tried to support myself with one hand and waved the other. My mom quickly picked me up. \\"Sung-guk, there are a lot of people, isn't it nice? Mom will take you out more often from now on.\\" [Sigh. That's not it...] My cries and gestures were just entertainment to them. Secretary Yang said something to Im Seon-mi and then left the waiting room together. [Today is the day...] I remembered the time my father knew I liked Im Seon-mi and took me to her commercial shoot. My father introduced me to Im Seon-mi. Im Seon-mi stroked my cheeks a few times with her hand and then disappeared with my father, returning later with her makeup removed. During that time, I played with Secretary Yang, uncle, at the shooting set. Soon, the door to the waiting room opened, and a curly-haired assistant director entered with a troubled face. \\"Ma'am, the shoot might be delayed a bit.\\" \\"Our Jae-hee is about to eat and sleep soon. Didn't you say you'd adjust the time?\\" \\"I'm sorry. It's just that Im Seon-mi is feeling a bit unwell.\\" [Where did that lie come from...] Im Seon-mi was busy in the back seat of my father's car at that time. My father said it wouldn't take long since he was in a hurry. I shook my head in disbelief. The middle-aged nanny briefly placed Jae-hee next to me. \\"Ma'am, I urgently need to go to the bathroom. Please watch Jae-hee for a moment.\\" \\"You should deduct the bathroom time from your salary. Hurry back.\\" \\"I'm sorry.\\" While the nanny was in the bathroom, the lady didn't lift a finger. The assistant director glanced around nervously and then quietly left, leaving my mom and me in an awkward silence. Jae-hee, sitting on the sofa next to me, looked utterly listless at a glance. Should I try talking to him? We're about the same age, so maybe we can communicate. [Hey, you don't want to shoot, do you?] Surprisingly, Jae-hee responded quickly. \\"Eung-ae. Eung. Eung-eung-eung.\\" [What? I kind of understand...] I looked at Jae-hee in surprise. Jae-hee continued to grumble discontentedly. [Tell me everything!] In summary, he didn't like the shoot because the lights were too hot and irritating, and he was annoyed by people telling him what to do. He was also hungry and sleepy. The pampered young master seemed to find this kind of work bothersome. Memories are something that come after growing up, but for now, he probably disliked this dusty shooting set. Taking care of what the other person dislikes. That was a way to gain trust in a business relationship. I told Jae-hee about Im Seon-mi's weakness exactly. [Hit that noona's nose. Her nose is her weak point. You'll probably get out of shooting if you hit her hard enough.] \\"Eung-ae?\\" [Of course, it's true. Don't worry and just hit her as hard as you can.] \\"Eung-ae.\\" Jae-hee nodded vigorously. \\"Oh, you two seem to get along well. What were you talking about?\\" The returning middle-aged nanny picked up Jae-hee. * * * \\"The shoot is about to start.\\" The assistant director rushed in and shouted. Jae-hee, ready, headed to the set with his mom and the nanny. I gave Jae-hee my last words of encouragement. [Fighting!] \\"Eung-ae!\\" Jae-hee responded with all his might. I was starting to like Jae-hee. It was clear he didn't want to be twisted by growing up in a wealthy family. [If only such a kid was born in a poor family and suffered in my place...] Suddenly, my mom's hand came in and patted my belly. It was my favorite technique of my mom's. When my mom patted my belly like this, all worries and concerns flew away, and I felt blissfully happy. \\"Sung-guk, even if we can't shoot today, thanks to you, mom had a great time watching. I even saw Im Seon-mi. Sung-guk, mom loves you so much.\\" Mom showered my cheeks with kisses. I was moved. In this life, I was too emotional. Just the words \\"I love you\\" made me emotional. I had never properly heard \\"I love you\\" before my regression. Everyone used to say they respected me more than they loved me. At that time, I thought that was good. I reached out my hand to my mom. Then, mom lifted me up over her protruding belly. \\"Mom thinks our Sung-guk is the prettiest... It seems the gentlemen here don't think so. But since the director promised to recommend us here and there, we'll have another chance, right?\\" [Opportunities are not to be waited for, but to be made, mom.] \\"Yes, yes. Let's wait with mom, Sung-guk.\\" I shook my head. Just then, the waiting room door opened, and the curly-haired assistant director rushed in. \\"Get ready.\\" \\"Huh?\\" My mom asked in surprise. \\"Get ready for the shoot! Can't you understand?\\" \\"Is it our Sung-guk's turn?\\" \\"Yes, that's right.\\" [What's with the attitude?] It seemed I had to remember this guy. Soon, staff members rushed in, dressed me in the onesie Jae-hee had worn, and ran to the set. I saw Im Seon-mi fixing her makeup with an angry face. Next to her stood Jae-hee's mom, equally angry. \\"Why can't you give us one more chance? Huh?\\" Jae-hee's mom was questioning the director. \\"We've already given you an hour, and it's the same. The kid doesn't listen, and he keeps hitting the female model's face. We have to finish shooting today. If it continues like this, we can't shoot tomorrow either!\\" \\"I'm going to call our chairman right now.\\" \\"Go ahead! I don't want to do this commercial either!\\" The director yelled angrily. This made Jae-hee burst into tears, and the set turned into chaos. Jae-hee's mom grabbed a brick-sized phone and dialed somewhere. That's when it happened. Im Seon-mi, who was fixing her makeup, walked over and snatched the phone. \\"What are you doing? Acting all high and mighty as a model.\\" \\"Do you know where we're shooting this commercial?\\" \\"How dare you speak informally?\\" Jae-hee's mom aggressively confronted Im Seon-mi. But Im Seon-mi was no pushover. \\"You started with the informal speech, so I'm just following suit. Mrs. Dukpung Paper. You should have behaved properly when you were treated as a lady. Your child doesn't listen and has no talent, so what are you going to do?\\" \\"This... Hey!\\" As Jae-hee's mom's hand went up, Im Seon-mi quickly grabbed it. The set went silent in an instant. I, too, watched, spellbound. Im Seon-mi looked around once and then stared straight at Jae-hee's mom. \\"Being born into a rich family and marrying well, you think the world is easy, but this isn't that kind of place. If you lack talent, just drink cold water and go home. This spot should be taken by someone with talent, right?\\" \\"Are you not letting go of my hand? You, I know all about you receiving sponsorship from the vice chairman of Samjeon Group. That's why you're the exclusive model for Samjeon Electronics. How can you be so brazen?\\" [Oh, the lady is tough too.] My mom and I held hands and watched the thrilling confrontation between the two women. \\"Then you know well. I have Samjeon Group behind me, and you're just a daughter-in-law of a small and medium-sized enterprise, acting all high and mighty?\\" \\"......\\" I almost clapped my hands. A daughter-in-law of a small and medium-sized enterprise, acting all high and mighty! That was exactly what I wanted to say. The director and staff, who were watching the scene, couldn't even open their mouths in shock. Im Seon-mi forcefully shook off Jae-hee's mom's hand and walked towards the director. \\"Director, let's start shooting with the backup model. I have a movie shoot tomorrow, so I don't have time. If that lady says anything, I'll call the vice chairman of Samjeon myself, so just ignore her and start shooting. If she's been bribing someone, unless it's the chairman of Samjeon Group, I'll take care of everything.\\" \\"Okay. Let's start shooting. Sung-guk, are you ready?\\" The director looked at me. I raised my hand high.

Both techniques serve different purposes and come with their own sets of advantages and potential drawbacks in the context of cybersecurity threat intelligence. # Fine-Tuning **Advantages:** 1. **Domain-Specific Customization:** Fine-tuning allows the LLM to adjust to the nuances of cybersecurity data, incorporating the specific jargon, patterns, and entities relevant to cyber threat reports and TTP documentation. 2. **Performance:** Fine-tuned models often provide better performance on narrowly defined tasks or datasets because they have been specifically adjusted to optimize for those criteria. 3. **Efficiency:** Once fine-tuned, these models can directly generate or classify content without needing additional external information at runtime, which can lead to faster inference times. **Limitations:** - **Data Requirements:** Fine-tuning effectively often requires a significant amount of labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive to produce in specialized domains like cyber threat hunting. - **Overfitting Risk:** There's a risk of the model overfitting to the training data, especially if the dataset is not diverse enough, which could limit its generalizability. # Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) **Advantages:** 1. **Up-to-date Information:** RAG models can leverage the most current data by retrieving relevant information from updated databases or the internet during the generation process. This is particularly valuable in fields like cybersecurity, where new threats emerge constantly. 2. **Flexibility and Adaptability:** They can adapt to new information without the need for retraining, as the knowledge base they draw from is continually updated. 3. **Handling Sparse Data:** RAG can be particularly useful in situations where the training data is sparse or not comprehensive, as it can pull in additional information as needed. **Limitations:** - **Complexity and Latency:** These models can be more complex to implement and might introduce higher latency in generating outputs, as they involve an additional retrieval step. - **Dependency on External Sources:** The quality of the generated content can be highly dependent on the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved documents or data. # Recommendation In deciding between fine-tuning and RAG for enhancing cyber threat intelligence with LLMs, consider your specific research goals and the nature of your dataset. For projects where the emphasis is on leveraging the most current and comprehensive insights into cyber threats and TTPs, and where data might be continually evolving, RAG could offer significant advantages by pulling in the latest information and offering more adaptable responses. However, for applications that demand high speed, specificity to a well-defined dataset, and where real-time data retrieval might not be critical, fine-tuning could be more appropriate. Given the dynamic nature of cyber threats, a hybrid approach might also be worth exploring. For instance, you could fine-tune a model on a specific corpus of cyber threat intelligence to establish a strong baseline understanding of the domain and then augment this with RAG to incorporate real-time updates and broader contextual information. This dual strategy could harness the strengths of both methods to create a more robust and adaptive tool for cyber threat hunting. Overall, your choice should align with the nuances of your project's objectives, data characteristics, and the specific challenges of the cyber threat intelligence domain. Pilot studies and preliminary experiments comparing the performance of both approaches on a subset of your tasks can provide valuable insights to guide your decision."},{"prompt":"Latest update your information date","completion":"The information I provided is based on knowledge and trends up to April 2023.

Their primary purpose is to prevent multiple inclusions of the same header file, which can lead to problems such as redefinition errors. They ensure that the compiler only includes a header file once, even if it’s referenced multiple times in various parts of your project through \`#include\` directives. When it comes to source files (\`.cpp\` files), the situation changes considerably. Each \`.cpp\` file is intended to be compiled into an object file (.o or .obj) separately, and the use of include guards within a \`.cpp\` file does not serve the purpose it does in header files. This is because source files are typically not included via \`#include\` directives, and therefore, will not be inserted into another file's text that gets compiled, potentially multiple times. Your scenario with a private class defined within a \`.cpp\` file (in your case, \`Privateclass.cpp\`) doesn't require include guards because: 1. The \`.cpp\` file itself is not expected to be included with an \`#include\` directive in other files. The very nature of a private class implemented directly within a \`.cpp\` file suggests it is meant to be encapsulated within that single compilation unit, not shared or reused by including it in other places. 2. Static methods in private classes used only within single \`.cpp\` files are not exposed outside their respective compilation unit, aligning with your encapsulation and friendship design considerations. However, one might argue why you have a guard named \`PRIVATECLASS_CPP\` in your \`.cpp\` file. If your intention was to conditionally compile certain parts of the \`.cpp\` file based on whether or not it has already been compiled, this wouldn’t work as expected because each \`.cpp\` file is compiled independently in its entirety. A more common practice to conditionally compile parts of files, be they header or source files, is to use other preprocessor directives based on conditions you define or that are predefined (e.g., based on the platform you're compiling for). In summary, include guards (\`#ifndef\`, \`#define\`, \`#endif\`) are a pattern for header files, not source files, and you generally should not use them in \`.cpp\` files. Instead, focus on proper design and organization of your classes, methods, and files to ensure encapsulation, reusability, and maintainability of your code."},{"prompt":"Напиши текст для питчинга техно альбома.

[다들 걱정 붙들어 매라고.] 나는 우선 짧은 목을 가볍게 풀었다. 감독이 파마머리 조연출을 화난 얼굴로 쳐다보는 게 보였다. “넌 이따 끝나고 보자.” “네… 감독님.” 파마머리 조연출은 주눅 든 목소리로 대답했다. 감독의 지시에 따라서 현장이 일제히 다시 정리됐다. 코디가 달려오더니 몇 가닥 안 난 내 머리카락을 빗으로 곱게 빗겼다. “얘가 어떻게 후보였어. 아까 걔보다 백배는 이쁜데.” [걔 돈 먹인 거야.] “어머, 애가 내 말에 옹알거리네. 누나가 이쁘게 해줄게.” [내 얼굴이 다 할 거지만, 뒷머리 좀 잘 눕혀봐.] 코디는 내 머리를 손질하고는 재빨리 자리를 떴다. 감독이 엄마와 함께 다가왔다. “어머니가 여기 계셔주세요. 선미 씨 보고 방긋 웃는 장면인데, 아기 모델 클로즈업 샷 먼저 딸 거거든요.” “네, 감독님. 성국이 잘 웃어요.” 감독이 근심 가득한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 제발 빨리 끝내자.” [오케이!] 감독이니 고개는 끄덕여줬다. “저 녀석, 꼭 내 말 알아듣는 거 같네.” 감독은 사방에 대고 소리쳤다. “자, 다들 스탠바이!” “네에!” 대답 소리가 들렸고, 곧 감독의 지시에 따라서 조명이 쏟아졌다. 화려한 조명이 나를 감싼다는 게 이런 느낌인가. 나는 화려한 조명을 만끽하며 카메라를 쳐다봤다. 카메라 바로 아래로 엄마가 몸을 최대한 낮춘 채로 나를 향해 손을 흔들었다. [나 콘티 이미 다 안다고, 엄마. 자, 이번 컷은 한 번에 간다!] 나는 엄마를 향해서 집에서 거울 보고 연습한 함박웃음을 지었다. 입 동굴이 개방되면서 목젖까지 보이는, 그야말로 누가 봐도 기분 좋은 함박웃음이었다. “커엇!” 감독의 우렁찬 목소리가 들렸다. “다시 돌려봐.” “네, 감독님.” 조연출이 얼른 녹화된 화면을 돌렸다. “이거 두 번 찍을 필요도 없네. 다음 신!” 나는 어깨를 으쓱하곤 다음 신을 시작했다. 아빠라는 단어를 말하는 이 광고의 하이라이트였다. 나는 아빠라는 단어의 억양을 미세하게 분석해서 끝을 올려보기도, 끝을 내려보기도 하면서 단 세 번 만에 오케이를 받아냈다. 광고장의 분위기는 활기차지기 시작했다. 만족스러운 컷들이 나오는 모양이었다. 엄마가 얼른 다가와서 기저귀를 확인하고, 물을 먹였다. “성국아, 힘들지?” [남의 돈 먹는 건 다 어려운 거야, 엄마.] 코디가 다가와서 다시 내 머리를 체크했다. 이제 임선미와의 마지막 촬영만 남았다. 임선미는 나에게 다가오더니 빙긋 미소를 지었다. “성국이라고 했지? 내가 빨래 바구니를 들고 들어오면서 빨래를 네 앞에 흘릴 거야.” [응. 알고 있어.] 임선미는 엄마를 보고도 설명을 이었다. “어머니, 너무 걱정 마세요. 저만 잘하면 되는 촬영이에요. 성국이는 아기니까, 여기에서 기어 다니기만 화면 감독님이 알아서 편집해서 잘 이어 붙여주실 거예요.” [무슨 소리야. 난 화면 밖에서도 연기하는 배우라고. 내 몸 연기, 기대해!] 임선미는 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국아, 잘하자.” [걱정 마, 임선미. 이 광고는 20년 후에도 회자되는 그런 광고가 될 거야.] 나는 미소를 지었다. 다시 카메라가 돌아갔다. 임선미는 빨래 바구니를 들고 세탁기로 향하면서 그만 남편의 셔츠를 바닥에 떨어뜨리고 만다. 나는 그 순간을 놓치지 않고 손을 쭉 뻗어 셔츠를 탁 잡았다! “퍼펙트!” 감독의 유쾌한 목소리가 들렸다. * * * “고생하셨습니다!” 임선미가 밝은 미소로 고개를 숙이며 스태프들에게 인사했다. 감독이 자리에서 일어나면서 만족스러운 얼굴로 스태프들에게 소리쳤다. “오늘 저녁은 내가 쏠 테니 한 명도 빠지지 말고 모여!” “네, 감독님!” 여기저기서 유쾌한 대답이 들렸다. “참, 조연출! 너 나 좀 보자.” “네… 감독님.” 파마머리 조연출은 감독의 눈치를 살폈다. 감독은 파마머리 조연출을 구석으로 데리고 갔다. “감독님, 무슨 할 말 있으세요?” “너, 나랑 일한 게 이번이 처음이지?” “네.” “회사에 말해둘 테니까, 이번 일 정산받고 다른 회사로 옮겨.” 파마머리 조연출은 잠시 말이 없었다. 얼굴이 붉어지더니 목소리가 격앙됐다. “감독님, 이건 저도 어쩔 수 없는 일이었잖아요.” “뭐가 어쩔 수 없는 일이야?” 감독은 한숨을 팍 내쉬었다. “저도 위에서 까라고 해서 깐 거예요.” “진짜 이 새끼가 끝까지….” 감독은 잠시 숨을 골랐다. “덕풍 제지 그 사모님인가, 누가 나가면서 너한테 돈까지 따로 찔러줬다고 그러더라! 어! 그런데 위에서 까라고 해서 깐 거라고?” “그, 그게….” “그래, 위에서 까라고 할 때도 있지. 나도 어쩔 수 없을 때도 있어. 근데 너처럼 미리 콘티 빼서 애한테 알려주고, 돈 더 받는 짓은 안 해. 너 당장 나가고, 성국이네한테 가서도 사과해!” “그건….” “못 하겠어?” 파마머리 조연출은 입을 앙다물었다. “가서 사과 안 하면 너 이 광고 바닥에 다시는 발도 못 붙일 줄 알아. 내가 그 정도 입김은 있는 거 너도 알지?” “…네. 감독님, 죄송합니다.” 파마머리 조연출은 어쩔 수 없이 고개를 숙였다. * * * 달콤한 바나나를 한입 깨물 찰나였다. 똑. 똑. 노크 소리가 들리더니 대기실 문이 열렸다. 파마머리 조연출이 누가 봐도 오늘 잘린 얼굴로 들어왔다. 그러곤 나를 원망 어린 눈으로 흘깃 쳐다봤다. 저 눈빛만으로도 뭔지 알 것 같았다. 해고된 것도 억울한데, 지금 나한테 사과까지 하라고 감독이 시킨 모양이었다. 삼전 그룹 회장 자리에 오르기까지 요직에 필요한 인재들을 자르고 고용하는 일을 수없이 했다. 내가 직접 말한 경우는 없지만, 어쨌든 우연치 않게 얼굴을 다시 볼 때면 꼭 저런 얼굴을 하고 있었다. 나는 바나나를 앙 깨물었다. 그리고 우물우물 씹어댔다. 파마머리 조연출은 엄마에게 다가가더니 시큰둥한 얼굴로 입을 열었다. “혹, 저 때문에 기분 나쁘신 일 있으셨으면 사과드릴게요.” 그때였다. 문틈 사이로 지나가던 감독이 버럭 소리를 쳤다. “야! 제대로 안 해!” 뜨끔 놀란 파마머리는 얼른 엄마와 내게 고개를 푹 숙이고는 문밖에 있는 감독 들으라는 듯이 소리쳤다. “저 때문에 기분 나쁜 일 있으셨다면 진심으로 사과드립니다!” “아니에요.” 엄마는 손사래를 쳤다. 나는 바나나를 우물거리며 파마머리 조연출을 눈에 담았다. 이 일을 하다 보면 여기저기서 만날 수 있었다. 원래 이런 기생충 같은 놈들이 생명력은 미친 듯이 끈질겼다. 이때, 감독이 문을 열고 들어섰다. “야! 끝났으면 마무리해.” 감독은 마무리까지 아주 깔끔하게 알려줬다. “네, 감독님. 전 가볼게요.” 파마머리 조연출은 연신 고개를 숙이고는 나갔다. 엄마는 얼른 감독님에게 음료수 하나를 내밀었다. “감독님, 고생 많으셨어요.” “아우, 우리 성국이가 고생했죠. 이 녀석 때문에 촬영 시간이 반으로 줄었어요.” 대기실 문이 열리면서 임선미도 고개를 삐죽 들이밀었다. “다 여기 있네요. 뭐야, 나 주인공 뺏긴 거예요?” 임선미가 환하게 웃으며 들어오더니 내 칭찬을 늘어놨다. “어머니, 진짜 성국이 떡잎부터 달라요. 어머니도 이렇게 미인이신데, 성국이 큰 모습도 기대돼요.” “과찬이세요. 우연히 참가한 건데, 광고까지 찍고 임선미 씨도 보고. 너무 행복했어요.” 엄마는 정말 해맑게 웃었다. 감독도 잘 챙기고, 자신을 낮추면서 상대방을 올려주는 것이, 엄마에게서 사회생활 만렙의 기운이 느껴졌다. 이 와중에 나는 광고 촬영에 너무 열과 성의를 다 쏟았는지 잠이 쏟아졌다. 엄마에게 안겨 꾸벅꾸벅 졸았다. 감독이 얼른 말을 건넸다. “이 녀석, 피곤한가 보네. 어머니, 회사 가는 봉고 타지 마시고 제 차로 같이 가세요. 집까지 데려다 드릴게요.” “아, 아니에요. 회사 가서 모델료도 받아야 하고.” “그건 걱정 마세요. 제가 다 알아서 해놓을게요.” “저희 집 멀어서요. 저희 데려다주고 가시면 회식 늦을 거예요.” 엄마는 한사코 만류했다. “집이 어디신데요? 전 내일 영화 촬영 때문에 어차피 회식 못 가거든요. 저녁에 먹으면 바로 붓는 스타일이라서요. 제가 태워다 드릴게요.” 임선미가 나섰다. 엄마는 얼른 손을 휘저었다. “말도 안 돼요.” “괜찮아요. 보니까 둘째 가지신 것 같은데, 봉고 타고 거기서 또 움직이셔야 하잖아요. 집 어디세요?” “수유리요.” 엄마는 기어들어 가는 목소리로 말했다. 대한민국에서 제일 잘나가는 여배우가 수유리 같은 곳을 모를 것이라고 여겼기 때문이다. “나 성국이랑 진짜 인연인가 봐, 감독님. 저 수유리 출신이잖아요. 오랜만에 동네도 구경하고, 데려다 드릴게요. 사양 마세요.” “진짜요?” “그럼, 진짜죠. 그러니까 사양 진짜 마세요.” “감사합니다. 감사합니다.” 엄마는 연신 허리를 굽혔다. 그 바람에 나도 연신 아래로 떨어졌다 위로 솟구치는 통에 조금 멀미가 났다. [엄마, 나 멀미 난다고.] “미안, 미안. 성국아.” 엄마는 나를 안고는 임선미를 따라나섰다. 엄마의 얼굴에 미소가 번졌다. 나는 감기는 눈으로 엄마의 미소를 황홀하게 바라봤다. 철의 여인은 한 번도 저런 미소를 보여준 적이 없었다. 어쩌면 미소를 지을 수 있었을지도 모른다. 다만, 미소 지을 수 없는 상황이 매일 반복되는 일상이었던 것인지도. 가난해도 행복할 수 있구나. 나는 스르르 눈을 감았다. * * * 임선미의 매니저는 우리 집 골목에서 차를 멈췄다. 꿀잠을 자고 일어난 나는 임선미를 보고 방긋방긋 웃어줬다. 회귀 전 철의 여인이 참 미워했는데, 오늘은 나에게 은인이나 다름없었다. “성국이 잠 다 잤어?” “응애.” “진짜 말귀 다 알아듣네. 어머니, 연락처 하나만 주세요.” “연락처요?” “성국이 이번 광고 나가면 아마 장난 아니게 광고 제의 많이 들어올 거예요. 어머니 혼자 감당 안 되실 거예요. 저희 기획사 괜찮거든요. 제가 소개해 드릴게요.” “아, 그것까진….” 엄마는 당황한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. 임선미가 재빨리 명함을 내밀었다. “저희 회사 대표님 명함이에요. 제가 대표님한테는 잘 이야기해 놓을 테니까, 꼭 연락 주세요.” [안 받고 뭐 해, 엄마!] 나는 얼른 엄마의 옷깃을 잡아당겼다. 엄마는 내 제스처를 읽고는 얼른 임선미가 내민 명함을 받아 들었다. “감사합니다. 정말 감사합니다.” “성국아, 다음에 또 보자!” 임선미가 손을 흔들었다. * * * 엄마는 믿기지 않는 얼굴로 멍하니 현관문 앞에 서서 열쇠를 찾고 있었다. “107호, 왜 그래요?” “어, 언니…?” 막 퇴근한 단발머리가 뒤에서 엄마를 불렀다. 단발머리의 얼굴에는 처음 보는 쾌감 같은 게 얼핏 보였다. “성국이가 대타로 홈런 날렸다면서요?” “벌써 소식 들으셨어요?” “감독님이 직접 전화 와서 모델료 빨리 정산해서 갖다 주라고 난리도 아니었어요. 심지어 책정된 모델료보다 더 주기로 했어요.” “정말요? 근데… 모델료 얼마예요?” 엄마는 눈을 깜빡였다. [엎드려서 셔츠 냄새 맡느라 내 승모근과 허리가 빳빳하게 굳었는데, 얼마 받는지도 모르다니.] “원래 300만 원인데, 삼전 그룹 쪽에서 보너스로 100만 원 더 넣어줬어요.” “그, 그럼….” “총 400만 원에서 세금 떼고 가지고 왔어요. 수령 확인서에 사인 좀 해줘요. 안 그러면 나 돈 떼먹은 사람 되니까요.” “당연히 사인해야죠.” 단발머리가 엄마에게 누런 봉투를 내밀었다. 엄마는 덜덜 떨리는 손으로 봉투를 받아 들었다. “어, 언니. 저 평생 이렇게 큰돈 처음 만져 봐요.” [엄마, 정신 차리라고. 나 전성국이야. 그 돈의 억만 배는 넘게 벌거니까, 그만 감동해.] “문단속 잘하고 있어요.” “어, 언니…. 성국이 아빠가 늦거든요. 같이 저녁 안 드실래요? 저, 너무 무서워요.” 단발머리는 살짝 갈등했다. 막 퇴근한 직장인에게 아기까지 딸린 여자가 같이 밥을 먹자는 것은 노동의 연장을 의미했다. 단발머리는 사지를 덜덜 떠는 엄마를 보더니 한숨을 쉬며 손짓을 했다. “우선 집에 들어가서 문 잘 잠그고 있어요. 요 앞에 가서 치킨 사올게요.” “어, 언니. 잠시만요.” 엄마가 노란 봉투에서 만 원짜리 한 장을 벌벌 떨며 꺼내려고 하자, 단발머리가 손으로 막았다. “됐어요. 이 돈 모아서 더 좋은 데 이사 가요. 어서 들어가 있어요.” “언니, 고마워요.” 단발머리는 총총걸음으로 다세대주택을 빠져나갔다. 피곤한 와중에도 나는 단발머리의 뒷모습을 쳐다봤다. 이전 생의 아버지인 전재형 회장은 항상 말씀하셨다. - 아무도 믿지 마라. 부모도, 자식도. 집주인 단발머리는 왜 우리한테 이렇게 잘해주는 걸까?","completion":"Episode 7 Opportunities are indeed created. I vividly remember this advertisement as well. It was a commercial for a top-loading washing machine ambitiously released by Samjeon Electronics. Lim Sun-mi, the exclusive model for Samjeon Electronics, is seen holding her husband's shirt and sniffing it. From various food smells to sweat and cigarette odors, she grimaces at the mix of scents and tries to put it in the laundry basket but ends up dropping it on the floor. The baby, who was playing around, crawls over, smells the dad's shirt, and says, \\"Da. Ddy!\\" making it the highlight of the advertisement. At the end, the baby is seen sleeping peacefully with the washed shirt from the top-loading washing machine, and Lim Sun-mi exclaims, \\"Laundry's done!\\" The storyboard was perfectly etched in my mind. All I had to do was direct the word \\"Daddy\\" and the face of a child sleeping without a care in the world. \\"Ms. Sun-mi, we'll start shooting with the baby first.\\" \\"Director, if we take any longer, I'm really going to be in trouble.\\" \\"I'll make it quick.\\" I heard the director and Lim Sun-mi conversing. [Everyone, don't worry.] I casually loosened my short neck. I saw the director glaring at the assistant director with permed hair. \\"We'll talk after this is over.\\" \\"Yes… Director.\\" The assistant director with permed hair responded in a subdued voice. Following the director's orders, the set was quickly reorganized. The stylist rushed over and neatly combed my sparse hair. \\"How was this kid even considered? The one before was a hundred times prettier.\\" [They must have been bribed.] \\"Oh, the baby's babbling in response to my words. I'll make you look pretty.\\" [I might be all face, but try to lay the back hair down nicely.] The stylist quickly finished up and left. The director approached with my mother. \\"Please stay here, mother. It's a scene where Ms. Sun-mi smiles brightly at you, but we'll shoot the baby model's close-up shot first.\\" \\"Yes, Director. Seong-guk smiles well.\\" The director looked at me with a worried face. \\"Seong-guk, let's finish this quickly.\\" [Okay!] I nodded as if I understood the director. \\"This kid, seems like he really understands me.\\" The director shouted to everyone. \\"Alright, everyone, standby!\\" \\"Yes!\\" Responses were heard, and soon, under the director's command, the lights were poured on. So this is what it feels like to be enveloped in dazzling lights. I enjoyed the glamorous lights and looked at the camera. Right below the camera, my mom crouched down as low as possible and waved at me. [I already know the storyboard, mom. Now, let's nail this cut in one go!] I smiled at my mom, practicing a beaming smile in the mirror at home. A smile so bright that anyone could see how happy I was, showing even my uvula. \\"Cut!\\" The director's resonant voice was heard. \\"Let's take it again.\\" \\"Yes, Director.\\" The assistant director quickly replayed the recorded scene. \\"No need to shoot this twice. Next scene!\\" I shrugged my shoulders and moved on to the next scene. It was the highlight of the advertisement, saying the word \\"Daddy.\\" I analyzed the intonation of the word \\"Daddy\\" minutely, trying to raise and lower the end, and received an okay in just three tries. The atmosphere on set began to liven up. It seemed like satisfactory cuts were coming out. My mom quickly came over to check my diaper and fed me water. \\"Seong-guk, are you tired?\\" [Eating someone else's money is always hard, mom.] The stylist came over and checked my hair again. Now, only the final shoot with Lim Sun-mi was left. Lim Sun-mi approached me and smiled brightly. \\"Seong-guk, right? When I come in holding the laundry basket and drop the laundry in front of you.\\" [Yeah. I know.] Lim Sun-mi continued to explain, looking at my mom. \\"Mom, don't worry too much. It's a shoot that only I need to do well. Seong-guk is just a baby, so the director will edit it nicely with him crawling around here.\\" [What are you talking about? I'm an actor who performs even off-screen. Look forward to my body acting!] Lim Sun-mi patted my head. \\"Seong-guk, let's do well.\\" [Don't worry, Lim Sun-mi. This advertisement will be talked about even 20 years later.] I smiled. The camera started rolling again. Lim Sun-mi, holding the laundry basket, heads towards the washing machine but ends up dropping her husband's shirt on the floor. I didn't miss the moment and stretched out my hand to grab the shirt! \\"Perfect!\\" The director's cheerful voice was heard. * * * \\"Thank you for your hard work!\\" Lim Sun-mi bowed with a bright smile to the staff. The director stood up, looking satisfied, and shouted to the staff. \\"I'll treat everyone to dinner tonight, so don't miss out!\\" \\"Yes, Director!\\" Cheerful responses were heard from here and there. \\"By the way, assistant director! I need to see you.\\" \\"Yes… Director.\\" The assistant director with permed hair glanced at the director. The director took the assistant director with permed hair to a corner. \\"Director, is there something you want to say?\\" \\"Is this your first time working with me?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"I'll talk to the company, so after settling this job, move to another company.\\" The assistant director with permed hair was silent for a moment. His face turned red, and his voice became agitated. \\"Director, I couldn't help it.\\" \\"What couldn't you help?\\" The director sighed deeply. \\"I was told to do it from above.\\" \\"This guy, until the end….\\" The director took a moment to breathe. \\"Was it the lady from Deokpung Paper, someone gave you extra money on the way out! Huh! And you're saying you were told to do it from above?\\" \\"That, that's….\\" \\"Yeah, there are times when you're told to do it from above. I also have times when I can't help it. But I don't do things like leaking the storyboard in advance and taking more money like you. Leave now, and go apologize to Seong-guk's family!\\" \\"That's….\\" \\"Can't do it?\\" The assistant director with permed hair clenched his mouth shut. \\"If you don't go apologize, know that you won't be able to set foot in this advertising industry again. You know I have that much influence, right?\\" \\"…Yes, Director. I'm sorry.\\" The assistant director with permed hair reluctantly bowed his head. * * * It was the moment I was about to bite into a sweet banana. Knock. Knock. The door to the waiting room opened, and the assistant director with permed hair, who obviously looked like he had been fired today, entered. He glanced at me with a resentful look. Just that look seemed to say it all. He was upset about being fired, and now the director had ordered him to apologize to me. In my previous life, as the chairman of Samjeon Group, I had countless times fired and hired essential personnel for key positions. I never said it directly, but whenever I happened to see their faces again, they always had that look. I bit into the banana. And chewed it thoroughly. The assistant director with permed hair approached my mom and started speaking with a half-hearted face. \\"If there was anything that upset you because of me, I apologize.\\" That's when it happened. The director, passing by the door, shouted angrily. \\"Hey! Do it properly!\\" Startled, the assistant director with permed hair quickly bowed deeply to my mom and me, shouting loud enough for the director outside to hear. \\"If there was anything that upset you because of me, I sincerely apologize!\\" \\"It's okay.\\" My mom waved her hands. I chewed on the banana while taking in the assistant director with permed hair. In this line of work, you could run into them anywhere. These parasitic types always had an insanely tenacious vitality. Then, the director entered the room. \\"Hey! If you're done, wrap it up.\\" The director neatly showed him how to finish up. \\"Yes, Director. I'll be leaving now.\\" The assistant director with permed hair bowed repeatedly and left. My mom quickly offered a drink to the director. \\"Director, you've worked hard.\\" \\"Ah, our Seong-guk worked hard. Because of this guy, the shooting time was cut in half.\\" The waiting room door opened, and Lim Sun-mi also peeked in. \\"Everyone's here. What, did I lose the lead role?\\" Lim Sun-mi entered with a bright smile and praised me. \\"Mom, Seong-guk is really special from the start. You're such a beauty, so I'm looking forward to seeing Seong-guk grow up.\\" \\"You flatter me. It was just a coincidence to participate, but filming an advertisement and meeting Ms. Lim Sun-mi. I was so happy.\\" My mom genuinely smiled. The director took good care of everyone, humbling himself while lifting others, emitting an aura of a social life master from my mom. Meanwhile, I was so focused on the advertisement shoot that I started to feel sleepy. I dozed off in my mom's arms. The director quickly spoke up. \\"This kid must be tired. Mom, don't take the company van, ride with me. I'll drop you off at home.\\" \\"Oh, no. We have to go to the company to receive the modeling fee.\\" \\"Don't worry about that. I'll take care of everything.\\" \\"Our house is far. If you drop us off, you'll be late for the dinner.\\" My mom firmly refused. \\"Where do you live? I have a movie shoot tomorrow, so I can't go to the dinner anyway. I swell up right away if I eat in the evening. I'll drive you.\\" Lim Sun-mi stepped in. My mom quickly waved her hands. \\"That's ridiculous.\\" \\"It's okay. It looks like you're expecting a second child, so it'll be hard to take the van and move again. Where do you live?\\" \\"Suyuri.\\" My mom spoke in a voice that seemed to shrink. She thought that the top actress in South Korea wouldn't know a place like Suyuri. \\"I guess Seong-guk and I really have a connection, Director. I'm from Suyuri. I'll take a look around my old neighborhood and drop you off. Please don't refuse.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Of course, it's true. So, please don't refuse.\\" \\"Thank you. Thank you so much.\\" My mom bowed repeatedly. Because of that, I kept falling down and rising up, making me a bit carsick. [Mom, I'm getting carsick.] \\"Sorry, sorry, Seong-guk.\\" My mom held me and followed Lim Sun-mi. A smile spread across my mom's face. I blissfully watched my mom's smile with drowsy eyes. The Iron Lady had never shown such a smile. Maybe she could have smiled. Perhaps it was just that situations where she could smile never occurred in her daily life. Even in poverty, one can be happy. I slowly closed my eyes. * * * Lim Sun-mi's manager stopped the car in our neighborhood alley. After a good sleep, I woke up and smiled brightly at Lim Sun-mi. Before regression, the Iron Lady was someone I really disliked, but today, she was almost like a benefactor to me. \\"Seong-guk, did you sleep well?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" \\"He really understands everything. Mom, can I have your contact number?\\" \\"Contact number?\\" \\"If Seong-guk's advertisement goes out, there will probably be a lot of advertisement offers. It'll be hard for you to handle alone. Our agency is pretty good. I'll introduce you.\\" \\"Oh, that's too much….\\" My mom looked at me, puzzled. Lim Sun-mi quickly handed over a business card. \\"This is our company president's business card. I'll talk to the president, so please contact us.\\" [Why aren't you taking it, mom!] I quickly tugged at my mom's clothes. Reading my gesture, my mom quickly took the business card Lim Sun-mi offered. \\"Thank you. Thank you so much.\\" \\"Seong-guk, let's meet again!\\" Lim Sun-mi waved her hand. * * * My mom stood dumbfounded in front of the front door, searching for the keys. \\"107, what's wrong?\\" \\"Oh, sister…?\\" The short-haired woman who had just returned from work called out to my mom from behind. A fleeting sense of pleasure seemed to cross the short-haired woman's face. \\"Seong-guk hit a home run as a substitute, right?\\" \\"Did you already hear the news?\\" \\"The director called directly, making a fuss about settling the modeling fee quickly and even decided to give more than the set amount.\\" \\"Really? But… how much is the modeling fee?\\" My mom blinked. [I strained my trapezius and back smelling that shirt, and you don't even know how much we're getting paid.] \\"It was originally 3 million won, but Samjeon Group added a bonus of 1 million won.\\" \\"So, that means….\\" \\"A total of 4 million won, minus taxes, I brought it. Please sign the receipt confirmation. Otherwise, I'll be accused of embezzlement.\\" \\"Of course, I'll sign.\\" The short-haired woman handed a yellow envelope to my mom. My mom's hands trembled as she took the envelope. \\"Oh, sister. This is the first time in my life I've held so much money.\\" [Get a grip, mom. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I'll earn millions of times more than that, so stop being moved.] \\"Make sure to lock the door well.\\" \\"Oh, sister…. Seong-guk's dad will be late, would you like to have dinner with us? I'm really scared.\\" The short-haired woman seemed conflicted for a moment. For a working woman who had just returned from work, being asked to have dinner with a woman and her baby meant an extension of labor. The short-haired woman looked at my mom, who was shivering, sighed, and gestured with her hand. \\"First, go inside and lock the door well. I'll go buy chicken from the front.\\" \\"Oh, sister. Wait a moment.\\" As my mom tried to shakily take out a 10,000 won bill from the yellow envelope, the short-haired woman stopped her with her hand. \\"It's okay. Save that money and move to a better place. Go inside and wait.\\" \\"Sister, thank you.\\" The short-haired woman hurriedly left the multi-family housing. Even though I was tired, I watched the short-haired woman's back. In my previous life, Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, my father, always said, - Trust no one. Not even parents or children. Why is the landlord, the short-haired woman, being so nice to us?"},{"prompt":"제9화 아빠는 보쌈집 사장과 한 잔 더 하고 11시가 넘어서 집에 들어왔다. 오늘은 아빠의 양손 가득 무언가가 들려 있었다. “자기야, 그게 다 뭐야?” “사장님이 이것저것 마구 챙겨주셨어. 광고 나올 때마다 손님들한테 자랑하시느라 난리도 아니었어. 매상도 다른 날보다 배로 올랐어.” “사장님 정말 좋은 분이셔.” “이것 봐. 성국이가 아까 보쌈 고기 잘 먹는 거 보고는 가게에서 쓰는 보쌈 고기도 따로 챙겨주셨어.” 나는 잠결에 엄마, 아빠의 대화를 듣고 있었다. 아빠는 그 이후에도 여러 가지 자랑을 늘어놨다. 오늘 내가 나온 광고 덕분에 하루 종일 힘이 났다는 것과 사장님이 이젠 자기가 만든 보쌈이랑 맛이 거의 비슷하다며 칭찬해준 일 등 시시껄렁한 이야기였다. “자기야, 사장님이 보쌈집으로 바꾸고 매출도 많이 올라서 다음 달부터 월급도 10만 원 인상해 주신대.” “10만 원이나! 성국이 정말 복덩이인가 봐. 성국이 태어나고 자기 일도 잘되고, 너무 좋아.” 엄마는 겨우 10만 원에 아빠의 손을 부여잡고 감동하고 있었다. 10만 원이면 뭘 할 수 있지? 삼전 호텔에서 저녁 한 끼 겨우 먹을 수 있을까. 내가 졸린 눈을 비비자 아빠가 다가왔다. “성국아, 안 잤어?” [정확히 말하면 자다 깬 거지. 시끄러워서.] “소영아, 우리 성국이 선물 지금 줄까?” 아차, 선물이 있었다. 나는 그 말 한마디에 눈이 또랑또랑해졌다. [나 전직 재벌인데, 왜 이렇게 없이 구는 거지?] 아빠는 늘 들고 다니는 낡은 손가방을 뒤지더니 뭔가 작고 얇은 것을 꺼내 내 눈앞에 가져다 댔다. [뭐야, 통장이잖아….] 나는 실망한 투로 옹알거렸다. “성국아. 이거 보여? 통장이야. 네가 이번에 광고 모델 해서 번 돈, 다 네 이름 앞으로 저축했어. 여기 네 이름으로 된 거 보여? 전성국.” 아빠는 내 눈앞에 ‘전성국’ 이름으로 만들어진 통장을 들이밀었다. 정말 모델료 받은 돈 한 푼도 빼놓지 않고 모두 입금된 통장이었다. 심지어 오디션 날 교통비로 받은 5만 원도 저축했다. [엄마, 아빠 바보야? 이걸 왜 고대로 저금해! 이 돈으로 집도 좀 옮기고, 하다못해 맨날 똑같은 옷 입고 다니는 엄마, 아빠 입을 옷이라도 사야지!] 나는 버럭 소리를 질렀지만, 금세 눈가가 촉촉해졌다. 세금 떼고 나면 채 400만 원도 안 되는 금액. 회귀 전에 나에게 이 돈은 그저 한 끼 식사 금액일 때도 있었고, 하룻밤 술값이 안 될 때도 있었다. 하지만 이들에게 이 돈은 한 남자가 식당에서 아침부터 저녁까지 일하고 받는 반년치 월급이었다. 그런 돈을 지금 한 푼도 안 쓰고 내 이름으로 모두 저축한 것이었다. “성국아, 이거 네가 번 거니까 다 네 거야. 엄마, 아빠는 하나도 안 건드렸어. 우리 성국이가 커서 학교 가면, 이 돈으로 배우고 싶은 거 있으면 엄마, 아빠가 다 시켜줄게.” [나 좀 그만 울리라고!] 나는 목이 멨다. “자기야, 우리 성국이 진짜 우리 말 알아듣나 봐. 눈시울이 붉어졌어.” “소영아, 성국이 진짜 감정이 풍부한 것 같아. 그래서 연기도 잘하나 봐.” 나는 작은 두 손으로 얼굴을 비벼댔다. 아빠가 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 이러면 얼굴 다쳐요. 우리 스타님.” [누가 울리래!] “자기야, 성국이 자다 깨서 졸린 것 같아. 내가 안을게.” “아니야, 소영아. 너 배 나와서 힘들잖아. 내가 안을게.” 아빠는 나를 안아서 어느새 등을 도닥였다. 식당에서 하루 종일 일하고 또 나를 안아 들었다. “성국아, 너는 정말 고아원에서 자라서 부모도 모르고 형제도 없는 우리 같은 사람들한테 온 복덩이야. 엄마, 아빠가 아직 많이 어려서 많이 부족하지? 그래도 엄마, 아빠가 진짜 열심히 살아서 우리 성국이는 부족한 거 없이 자라도록 노력할게. 성국아, 사랑해.” 크응. 나는 몰래 울음을 삼켰다. 회귀 전의 나에게 이렇게 따뜻했던 사람이 있었던가. 부모조차 나를 자식이 아닌 삼전 그룹의 후계자로 생각하고 따뜻한 말보다 혹독한 채찍을 가했다. 주변 사람들은 내가 삼전 그룹의 후계자라는 사실을 알면 어떻게든 내게 잘 보여 뭐라도 뜯어갈 생각만 했다. 나는 아빠 품에 폭 안겼다. 그리고 광고 속 그 한마디를 외쳤다. “아. 빠?” “소영아, 들었어?” 아빠가 들뜬 얼굴로 엄마를 쳐다봤다. 엄마는 내 엉덩이를 토닥였다. “자기야! 우리 성국이, 아빠 진짜 잘하지?” “소영아, 사실은… 우리 성국이가 엄마, 아빠 말을 너무 안 해서 사실 한동안 고민했거든.” 얼마 전까지 이들은 내가 크는 동안 양육을 담당하는 대리모와 대리부 정도의 존재였다. “그게, 성국이한테 내가 부족한 아빠라서 그런 게 아닌가 괜히 자격지심 들고 그랬는데, 이제야 마음이 놓이는 것 같아.” “자기야, 그런 생각 하지 마. 우리 성국이 진짜 아빠라는 말을 세상에서 제일 잘하는 애니까.” “그러게. 어! 성국이 자나 보다.” 이럴 때는 자는 척이라도 해줘야 할 것 같았다. 나도 눈치라는 게 있다. 스물세 살의 아빠와 그보다 어린 엄마. 둘만의 시간이 필요해 보였다. 나는 슬그머니 눈을 감았다. * * * 삼전 전자 CF를 찍은 곽 감독이 집 앞까지 찾아왔다. 곽 감독의 손에는 과일바구니가 들려 있었다. 오랜만에 보는 열대과일이었다. 나는 어느새 과일바구니를 향해 기어갔다. 애가 되더니 전에는 없던 식탐까지 생긴 모양이다. 얼른 멜론을 집어 들려는 순간, 엄마가 나를 안았다. [하아, 멜론 좋아하는데. 저기다 하몽 얹어서 와인 한 잔 하면 피로가 싹 가시는데….] 나는 입맛을 다셨다. 아빠가 얼른 감독에게 직접 탄 믹스 커피를 내밀었다. “감독님, 어쩐 일이세요?” “성국이가 요즘 엄청 핫한 거 아시죠?” “저희는 실감이 안 나요.” “그러실 만도 하죠. 오늘 제가 온 것은 다름이 아니라 성국이한테 제안을 하나 하려고요.” “제안이요?” 아빠가 되물었다. “이런 이야기 어려우실 수 있는데요. 지금 다른 광고 제안 들어와도 하지 마시고, 방송 하나를 하면 어떨까 해서요.” “광고도 더는 생각해보지 않았어요. 그런데 방송이라니….” [아빠, 원래 일이라는 것은 연달아 들어오는 법이야.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “이번에 MVC 방송국 일요일 저녁 버라이어티 쇼에서 새로 신설되는 거거든요. 한 번도 아이를 키워본 적 없는 어린 남자 가수들이 아이를 키우는 거예요. 거기 성국이가 메인이고요.” [아, 그거!] 나는 기억을 떠올렸다. 남자 아이돌 그룹이 어린아이를 키우는, 육아 프로그램의 시조새쯤 되는 거였다. 물론 이건 당연히 해야 한다. 당대에는 물론, 후에도 무척이나 회자되는 육아 프로그램의 레전드였다. 아빠의 표정이 점점 어두워졌다. “감독님 제의는 감사하지만요….” 아빠는 말끝을 흐렸다. [아빠, 이건 아니지!] 나는 발버둥을 쳤지만, 아무도 내 이야기에 귀를 기울이진 않았다. 그렇다면! “으아앙! 으앙!” “성국아, 왜 그래?” 엄마가 얼른 나를 안았다. [왜 그러긴. 엄마, 아빠 좀 말려봐! 이건 내가 내 능력으로 따낸 황금 같은 기회라고!] 아빠는 생각한 말을 내뱉었다. “성국이가 자꾸 방송을 타면 다른 아이들과 다르게 자랄까 봐 걱정이 돼서요.” 나는 잠시 울음을 멈췄다. 의외의 대답인걸? 감독은 깊게 고개를 끄덕였다. “아버님, 고민 이해됩니다. 아무래도 방송에 노출되다 보면 사람들이 많이 알아보고 아이도 그 시선 속에서 자라게 되니까요.” 아빠는 고개를 끄덕였다. “저는 평범하게 아이를 키우고 싶습니다.” “하지만 아버님. 성국이는 정말 제가 본 다른 애들과 다릅니다. 외모도 외모지만, 타고난 재능이라는 게 보여요. 스스로 빛날 줄 아는 아이 같다는 말씀입니다. 그리고 요즘 부모들은 이런 방송 못 내보내서 난리거든요. 아이도 유명해지고 돈도 되니까요.” “…사실은 저희 부부가 모두 고아원에서 자랐거든요.” “아….” 감독은 놀라 아무 말도 못 했다. 아빠는 담담히 말을 이었다. “그래서 남의 손에 애를 맡기고 싶지 않았어요. 어릴 때만큼은 엄마, 아빠 사랑 듬뿍 받고 자라야 하는 거잖아요. 부족한 저희한테 찾아온 생명인데, 그래야 하잖아요.” 나는 주먹을 앙 쥐고 입을 틀어막았다. 눈시울이 뜨거워지는 것을 겨우 참아내고 있었다. [이번 생의 부모는 왜케 사연이 구구절절한 거야.] 감독도 어느새 붉어진 눈시울을 두 손으로 꾹 눌렀다. 나는 겨우 정신을 차리고 엄마 품을 벗어나 아빠에게 기어갔다. 아빠의 마음을 전부는 알 수 없지만, 아주 조금은 알 것 같았다. 하지만 이건 비즈니스이다. 나는 얼른 아빠의 무릎 나온 바지를 물고 뜯었다. [아빠, 지금도 사랑은 충분해. 돈이 많으면 더 많은 사랑을 줄 수도 있어!] 돈과 사랑의 비례는 일정할 때 최상의 시너지를 낸다. 돈이 너무 많아지거나, 사랑이 너무 많아지면 그때부터 문제가 생기는 법이다. 감독은 잠긴 목을 풀더니 아빠를 쳐다봤다. “아버님 뜻은 잘 알겠습니다.” [감독, 이렇게 포기하면 안 돼!] 감독은 나를 흘깃 보더니 다시 말을 이었다. “아버님, 그래도 한 번 잘 생각해 보세요. 두 분 사정 들으니 알 것 같지만, 부모님이 이렇게 사랑하고 생각해 주는데, 잠시 방송하는 건 크게 문제 될 것 없어 보이거든요. 출연도도 적지는 않을 거고요.” “저희는 돈 때문이 아니라요.” 아빠는 어렵게 말을 꺼냈다. 우리 아빠, 엄마의 행색을 보면 누구든 형편이 어렵다는 것은 단번에 알 수 있다. 나는 엄마의 허리를 꼭 껴안았다. [엄마, 걱정하지 마. 내가 10년 안에 부자 만들어 줄 테니까.] 감독이 엄마에게 안긴 나를 보더니 배시시 웃었다. “이런 말씀 이상할지 모르지만… 성국이는 진짜 사람 말 알아듣는 거 같아요. 아무튼 제가 오늘 드릴 제안은 이거였어요. 방송국 오디션을 보시는 게 어떻겠냐는 거죠. 대신, 이 방송 조건에 6개월 동안은 광고 금지예요.” 나는 얼른 아빠의 등짝을 팡팡 쳤다. [아빠, 이거야!] 아빠가 나를 내려다봤다. “성국이, 하고 싶어?” “네에!” 나는 자신 있게 대답했다. * * * 지금 내 눈앞에는 회귀 전에 내가 즐겨 듣던 <너만을 원해>를 부른 국민 아이돌 그룹 ‘저스트’ 다섯 명이 있었다. 물론 지금은 무명에서 조금 벗어난 신생 그룹 수준이었다. 이 녀석들은 몇 년 후에 엄청나게 성공해서 국민 아이돌 그룹이 된다. [내 열두 살 생일에 와서 노래도 부른 녀석들인데….] 나는 그날을 떠올렸다. 삼전 호텔의 가장 큰 연회장에서 열린 내 열두 살 생일에는 ‘저스트’뿐 아니라 막 떠오르는 여자 아이돌 그룹도 모두 참석했다. 그들의 첫 멘트는 이거였다. “전성국 도련님, 열두 번째 생일 축하드립니다!” 모두들 나와 아이 컨택 하려고 애썼었는데…. ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 나중에 나이를 먹은 후에 사석에서 몇 번 마주치기도 했다. 아이돌들이 대부분 그렇듯 몇은 배우, 몇은 생계형 방송인이 된다. 먼저 리더인 태형이 나에게 다가왔다. ‘저스트’는 본명을 쓰는 멤버도 있었고, 영어 이름을 쓰는 멤버도 있었다. “네가 아빠! 그 모델이구나. 형도 그 광고 봤어.” 리더이자 메인 래퍼인 태형은 잘생긴 얼굴에 토종 한국인임에도 불구하고 영어를 곧잘 해서 팀에서 브레인으로 통했다. 나중에 의류 사업 한다며 나대던 기억이 나는데, 인성도 크게 나쁘지 않고, 자기 이익은 잘 챙기는 스타일이라 재벌가의 먼 친척쯤 되는 여자랑 결혼해서 잘 산다. 그 뒤로 키가 유난히 큰 루카스가 다가왔다. 루카스는 덩치에 비해 웃는 모습은 순수해 보였다. 순진한 웃음에 근육질 몸매. 근육돌의 시초쯤 되는 녀석인데, 생긴 것처럼 성격도 단순한 체대 오빠 스타일로 여자들에게 인기가 많았다. “와, 장난 아니게 이쁘게 생겼네. 우리보다 성국이가 더 주목받겠는걸.” [그거야 당연한 말씀. 두고 보라고!]","completion":"Episode 9 Dad came home after 11 PM, having had another drink with the bossam (Korean boiled pork wrap) restaurant owner. Today, his hands were full of various things. \\"Honey, what's all that?\\" \\"The boss gave us all sorts of things. He's been bragging to the customers about the commercial you were in all day. Sales even doubled compared to other days.\\" \\"The boss is really a good person.\\" \\"Look at this. Seeing Seong-guk eat bossam meat so well earlier, he even packed some of the meat they use at the restaurant for us.\\" I was half-asleep, listening to Mom and Dad's conversation. Dad continued to boast about various things afterward. He was energized all day thanks to the commercial I was in, and the boss praised him, saying his homemade bossam almost matched the taste of the restaurant's. It was a trivial story. \\"Honey, the boss said he's been doing so well since switching to a bossam restaurant that he's going to raise your salary by 100,000 won starting next month.\\" \\"100,000 won! Seong-guk must really be a lucky charm. Ever since Seong-guk was born, things have been going well for you, and I'm so happy.\\" Mom was moved, holding Dad's hand tightly over just 100,000 won. What can you do with 100,000 won? Maybe barely afford a dinner at Samjeon Hotel. As I rubbed my sleepy eyes, Dad approached me. \\"Seong-guk, you're not asleep?\\" [Technically, I was asleep. You woke me up because you were loud.] \\"So-young, should we give Seong-guk his present now?\\" Ah, there was a present. At that mention, my eyes sparkled. [I'm a former chaebol, why am I living so modestly?] Dad rummaged through his old handbag and pulled out something small and thin, holding it up in front of me. [What, a bankbook?] I grumbled in disappointment. \\"Seong-guk, see this? It's a bankbook. The money you earned from the commercial modeling, we've saved it all in your name. See, it's under your name, Jeon Seong-guk.\\" Dad showed me the bankbook created under the name 'Jeon Seong-guk.' It was a bankbook where not a single penny of the modeling fee was missing. Even the 50,000 won received for transportation on the audition day was saved. [Mom, Dad, are you fools? Why would you save all this money! We should move to a better place, or at least buy new clothes for Mom and Dad who wear the same clothes every day!] I yelled, but soon my eyes moistened. After taxes, it was barely less than 4 million won. Before regression, this amount was just enough for a meal or not even enough for a night's drinking for me. But for them, this money was half a year's salary for a man working from morning till night at a restaurant. And now, they've saved all that money under my name without spending a penny. \\"Seong-guk, this is all your money because you earned it. Mom and Dad didn't touch any of it. When you grow up and go to school, if there's anything you want to learn, Mom and Dad will let you do it.\\" [Stop making me cry!] My throat was tight. \\"Honey, I think Seong-guk really understands us. His eyes are getting red.\\" \\"So-young, Seong-guk seems to be really emotional. That's probably why he acts so well.\\" I rubbed my small hands over my face. Dad held my hand. \\"Seong-guk, you'll hurt your face if you do that. Our star.\\" [Who asked you to make me cry!] \\"Honey, Seong-guk seems sleepy because he woke up. I'll hold him.\\" \\"No, So-young. You're pregnant and it's hard for you. I'll hold him.\\" Dad held me and soon patted my back. He had been working all day at the restaurant and now he was holding me. \\"Seong-guk, you're really a blessing to us, who grew up in an orphanage without knowing our parents or siblings. Mom and Dad are still very young and lacking, but we'll try our best to live so that Seong-guk can grow up without lacking anything. Seong-guk, we love you.\\" I secretly swallowed my tears. Did I have someone this warm in my life before regression? Even my parents thought of me not as their child but as the heir to Samjeon Group, preferring harsh discipline over warm words. People around me only tried to show off to me, thinking of ways to take advantage of the fact that I was the heir to Samjeon Group. I hugged Dad tightly. And I shouted that one word from the commercial. \\"Dad?\\" \\"So-young, did you hear?\\" Dad looked at Mom with an excited face. Mom patted my bottom. \\"Honey! Our Seong-guk, he really does well, doesn't he?\\" \\"So-young, actually... I've been worried for a while because Seong-guk doesn't talk much to us.\\" Until recently, they were just surrogates taking care of me as I grew up. \\"I thought maybe I was lacking as a father, and I felt unworthy, but now I feel relieved.\\" \\"Honey, don't think like that. Our Seong-guk is the best at saying 'Dad' in the world.\\" \\"Looks like Seong-guk is asleep.\\" It seemed like I should pretend to be asleep at times like this. I have some sense, too. A twenty-three-year-old dad and an even younger mom. They seemed to need their own time. I quietly closed my eyes."},{"prompt":"What is an approximate extraction efficiency (yield %) of cellulose from mango peel?","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, specific studies on the exact yield percentage of cellulose extraction from mango peel may vary due to the methodology used, the condition of the raw material (e.g., ripeness, variety of mango), and the processing parameters (e.g., temperature, solvent used, time). However, to give you a general idea, cellulose extraction from agricultural waste products, including fruit peels like mango, typically yields a cellulose content that could range from about 20% to 60% of the dry weight of the processed material, depending on the specifics of the method applied (such as chemical treatment, mechanical processing, etc.). In research literature, yields of cellulose specifically from mango peel are less commonly detailed compared to more broadly categorized biomass sources. However, it's reasonable to extrapolate based on similar materials. For example, extraction processes involving alkali treatments followed by bleaching tend to result in higher purity and yield of cellulose by removing lignin and hemicellulose components effectively. For a more precise yield percentage specific to mango peel, one would need to refer to targeted studies or experimentations that detail the exact procedures used, including the pre-treatment of the peels, the chemicals employed (e.g., sodium hydroxide for alkali treatment, various bleaching agents), their concentrations, and the conditions of the extraction process (time, temperature, etc.).

However, in cases where feature scaling is necessary or beneficial (e.g., when features have different units or varying ranges), various scalers besides \`StandardScaler\` can be used depending on the nature of your data and the specific requirements of your model. Here are a few common scalers from scikit-learn that you can use apart from \`StandardScaler\`: 1. **MinMaxScaler:** - Scales the data to a specified range (usually [0, 1]). - It is useful when you need to transform features to a given range and maintain the distribution. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1)) \`\`\` 2. **RobustScaler:** - Scales the data according to the interquartile range (IQR). - It is useful for data with outliers, as it uses the median and quartiles, which are robust to outliers. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler scaler = RobustScaler() \`\`\` 3. **MaxAbsScaler:** - Scales each feature by its maximum absolute value. - This scaler is meant for data that is already centered at zero or sparse data. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler scaler = MaxAbsScaler() \`\`\` 4. **PowerTransformer:** - Applies a power transformation to each feature to make the data more Gaussian-like. - Useful for modeling issues related to heteroscedasticity or non-normal distributions. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import PowerTransformer scaler = PowerTransformer(method='yeo-johnson') # or method='box-cox' \`\`\` 5. **QuantileTransformer:** - Transforms the features to follow a uniform or a normal distribution. - It is useful for mitigating the effects of outliers and transforming non-linear features. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import QuantileTransformer scaler = QuantileTransformer(output_distribution='uniform') \`\`\` 6. **Normalizer:** - Scales individual samples to have unit norm. - It can be useful for sparse datasets (lots of zeros) with features of varying scales when using algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the data. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import Normalizer scaler = Normalizer(norm='l2') \`\`\` When choosing a scaler, consider the distribution and nature of your data, the presence of outliers, and how your model responds to different feature scales.

You can use these scalers to preprocess your data independently from your model code. The preprocessing step is typically done before feeding the data into any model, including an XGBRegressor or any other machine learning algorithm. Here's a general approach on how to apply a scaler to your dataset without tying it directly to model training code: 1. **Select and Import the Scaler:** First, choose the scaler you wish to use (e.g., \`MinMaxScaler\`, \`RobustScaler\`) and import it from \`sklearn.preprocessing\`. 2. **Fit the Scaler:** Use the \`.fit()\` method on your training data to allow the scaler to learn the parameters (mean and scale for \`StandardScaler\`, min and max for \`MinMaxScaler\`, etc.). 3. **Transform the Data:** With the fitted scaler, you can now transform your training data using the \`.transform()\` method. To avoid data leakage, remember that the scaler should be fitted only on the training set, then applied to any test or unseen data with the parameters learned from the training set. 4. **Inverse Transform (Optional):** If needed, for example, to interpret model output back in the original scale, you can use the scaler's \`.inverse_transform()\` function. Below is an example demonstrating how to use the \`MinMaxScaler\`. The same steps apply to other scalers, with the only difference being the scaler you choose to import and use. \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler import numpy as np import pandas as pd # Example dataset data = np.array([[1, -1, 2], [2, 0, 0], [0, 1, -1]]) # Convert to DataFrame for better visualization df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'Feature3']) # Initialize the Scaler scaler = MinMaxScaler() # Fit the scaler to the data - learns the min and max values of the data scaler.fit(df) # Transform the data using the fitted scaler df_scaled = scaler.transform(df) # Convert scaled data back to DataFrame for better visualization df_scaled = pd.DataFrame(df_scaled, columns=['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'Feature3']) print(\\"Original Data:n\\", df) print(\\"nScaled Data:n\\", df_scaled) \`\`\` Remember to apply the same \`fit\` from your training data to scale any new or test data using the \`.transform()\` method without fitting again. Fitting the scaler again on the test data or unseen data would introduce data leakage and likely lead to incorrect model performance metrics. \`\`\`python # Assuming df_test is your test or new data df_test_scaled = scaler.transform(df_test) \`\`\` This separation of data preprocessing, including scaling from the model code, allows for cleaner, more modular coding practices, making it easier to switch between different models or preprocessing techniques."},{"prompt":"how is the code for the scailer, to get train and test data from x","completion":"To use a scaler effectively and ensure that your model evaluation is realistic, it's crucial to split your data into training and testing sets before applying any scaling transformations. This prevents information from the test set from leaking into the training process, which can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates.

It learns the minimum and maximum values of the features in \`X_train\`. - Next, we used the fitted scaler to transform both \`X_train\` and \`X_test\`. This ensures that the transformation applied to the test data is based on the parameters learned from the training data, preventing data leakage. - Finally, converted the scaled numpy arrays back to pandas DataFrames for better readability and inspection. This step is optional and depends on your preference and the requirements of your workflow.

This can happen for a few reasons, most commonly due to: 1. **Data Preprocessing Differences:** Perhaps during the training phase, you performed certain preprocessing steps that altered the number of features. These could include one-hot encoding, polynomial feature expansions, adding interaction terms, or any feature engineering steps that increase the number of features in your dataset. 2. **Feature Selection/Reduction Not Applied Consistently:** If you've used techniques like PCA, LDA, or any feature selection method that reduces or alters the number of features, you need to ensure that the same transformation is applied to any new data before making predictions. 3. **Incomplete Data or Incorrect Data Handling:** There might be an issue with how the data is being loaded or processed before prediction. For example, missing preprocessing steps applied during training but forgotten during prediction. To resolve this issue, make sure that: - The exact same preprocessing steps (including all feature engineering transformations) are applied to the new data (the data you're trying to predict on) as were applied to the training data. - If you're using pipelines, ensure that the pipeline that includes the preprocessing steps and the model is fitted on the training data and then used to predict on the new data. This ensures consistency in the preprocessing steps. Here's an illustrative example of ensuring consistency using a pipeline with \`LinearRegression\` and a simple feature preprocessing step: \`\`\`python from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline import pandas as pd import numpy as np # Simulated Data np.random.seed(0) X = np.random.randn(100, 10) # 100 examples, 10 features y = np.dot(X, np.random.randn(10)) + np.random.randn(100) # Random linear-like target # Split the data X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) # Create a Pipeline pipe = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), LinearRegression()) # Fit the model with the Pipeline pipe.fit(X_train, y_train) # Now you can predict with the same preprocessing steps included y_pred = pipe.predict(X_test) # Everything should work without errors, the pipeline ensures preprocessing steps # are applied consistently during both training and prediction. \`\`\` In your case, double-check all the preprocessing steps leading up to the point where you train your \`LinearRegression\` model. Ensure that the same steps are precisely applied to any new data before prediction. If you are using feature generation methods (like one-hot encoding, polynomial features, etc.), those must be included as well."},{"prompt":"is there a model for data like mostly zero and other parabola","completion":"When dealing with data that primarily consists of zeros but also contains patterns like a parabola among the non-zero values, you’re tackling two challenges: sparsity and non-linear relationships. Choosing the right model to handle such data efficiently depends on the specifics of your data and your project goals. Here is a layered strategy to approach this kind of scenario: # 1. Handling Sparsity For sparse data (data with a lot of zeros), models that can naturally handle or even take advantage of sparsity are often a good choice. Some examples include: - **Tree-based models** (like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines, including XGBoost and LightGBM): These models naturally handle sparsity well because they make decisions based on whether or not a condition is true, effectively separating zeros from non-zeros in their split decisions. - **Sparse Linear Models** (like Lasso Regression): These models are tailored for scenarios where sparsity is a feature of the data. For instance, Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression can favor solutions with fewer parameter values, effectively making it work well with sparse features by ignoring the less relevant ones. # 2. Capturing Non-linear Relationships The parabolic relationship indicates a non-linear association between the features and the target variable. Several machine learning models and techniques are adept at capturing such non-linearities: - **Polynomial Features and Linear Models**: One way to fit a model to a parabolic relationship is to engineer polynomial features (e.g., squared or cubic terms of your original features) and then use a linear model, like linear regression or Lasso, to capture the non-linear relationship. - **Kernel-based Methods**: For example, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with non-linear kernels (like the radial basis function or polynomial kernel) can model non-linear relationships without explicitly adding polynomial features. - **Neural Networks**: These are powerful tools for modeling complex non-linear relationships. Even a simple feedforward neural network with a few layers can capture a parabolic relationship, given enough data and appropriate regularization to prevent overfitting. - **Tree-based Models**: As mentioned, tree-based algorithms can also capture non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, making them a versatile choice for both sparsity and non-linear patterns. # Approach Given your data characteristics: 1. **Explore the Data**: Start with visualizations and descriptive analytics to understand the exact nature of the zeros and the parabolic relationships. Are the zeros truly zeros, or do they represent missing or undefined values? 2. **Preprocess**: Depending on the nature of zeros, preprocessing steps might be required. For instance, if zeros are significant and represent actual measurements (not missing data), then models that handle sparsity naturally should be prioritized. 3. **Feature Engineering**: For the parabolic relationship, consider polynomial feature engineering if opting for linear models or kernels. For tree-based methods and neural networks, raw features might suffice, as these models can inherently capture non-linearities. 4. **Model Selection**: Start with models known to handle sparsity well and can model non-linear relationships, such as tree-based methods. If computational resources allow, also experiment with neural networks, but be mindful of the risk of overfitting, especially if your dataset is not very large. 5. **Validation and Testing**: Use proper cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of your models. Given the sparsity and non-linearity, pay close attention to how your model performs on both the sparse zero areas and the non-zero parabolic data sections. This helps ensure that your model generalizes well across the entire dataset. 6. **Iterative Improvement**: Machine learning is an iterative process. Based on initial results, you might revisit preprocessing, feature engineering, or try different models to improve performance. Remember, choosing the right model and approach depends heavily on your specific data and the context of your problem. It often requires experimentation and validation to find the best strategy."},{"prompt":"get me a code for a poly regression model","completion":"To create a polynomial regression model, you can use scikit-learn's \`PolynomialFeatures\` in combination with a linear regression model like \`LinearRegression\`.

[하아….] 나는 한숨을 한 번 더 내쉬었다. 이 가게에 미래 같은 것은 없어 보였다. 막 테이블을 치우고 있던 중년의 남자가 우리를 반겼다. “성국이 엄마 왔네.” “사장님, 잘 계셨어요?” “아이고, 이 녀석이 복덩이 성국이구나.” 아빠가 주방 안에서 고개를 삐죽 내밀었다. “소영아, 왔어?” “응, 자기야.” [아빠!] 나는 손을 들어 흔들었다. 저 사람이 바로 나의 이유식과 기저귀를 책임지고 있는 이 집의 가장이다, 뭐 이런 의미였다. “성국아, 아빠 곧 나갈 테니까 조금만 기다려. 소영아, TV 앞에 빈자리에 앉아.” “응.” 엄마는 TV 앞 빈자리에 앉았다. 손을 닦고 온 사장이 얼른 달려오더니 내 이마를 쓰다듬었다. “지성 씨가 맨날 자랑하던데. 사진보다 실물이 백배는 더 이쁘네요.” [당연한 말씀을….] 내가 히죽거리자 사장은 얼른 자리에서 일어나더니 냉장고로 향했다. “성국이는 아직 보쌈 같은 거 못 먹으니 바나나 좀 사다놨어요.” “이유식 먹고 왔어요. 안 그러셔도 되는데요.” “지성 씨 없으면 우리 가게 안 돌아가요. 지성 씨가 우리 집 보쌈이 맛있다고 주막에서 보쌈 전문점으로 바꾸자고 해서 바꿔서 그나마 요즘 숨통 트였잖아.” 나는 주방에서 일하는 아빠를 다시 봤다. 그러고 보니 가게 인테리어가 일반 보쌈집 같지는 않았다. 한옥 스타일의 고풍스러운 인테리어. 사이사이 걸려 있는 조잡한 그림이나 소품들. TV 드라마에서 돈 없는 서민들이 막걸리나 마시는 주점 분위기였다. 사장은 들뜬 목소리로 연신 말을 이었다. “손님들이 보쌈 맛있다고 해도 이거 하나로 승부 볼 생각은 못 했거든. 근데 지성 씨가 메인 메뉴로 보쌈 두고, 술안주 몇 개만 남기고 정리하는 게 이윤도 더 많이 남고 테이블 회전도 빠를 거라고 강력하게 주장해서 바꾸고 나서 정말 잘되고 있어요.” 사장은 내 앞에 바나나를 까서 내밀었다. 엄마가 얼른 작게 잘라서 내 입에 밀어 넣었다. “성국아, 천천히 먹어.” [이가 성치 못해서 빨리도 못 먹어.] 나는 이제 막 나기 시작한 앞니 두 개로 바나나를 잘라먹었다. 손님들이 연이어 밀려들어 왔다. “사장님, 가서 일 보세요.” “그럼, 광고 시작할 때 같이 봐요.” 사장은 얼른 손님을 맞았고, 엄마와 나는 TV를 보며 광고를 기다렸다. 주방에서 구수한 냄새가 흘러나왔다. 킁킁. [맛있겠다.] 나도 모르게 입가에 침이 흘렀다. [전성국, 왜 이래. 품위 없게.] 갑자기 바나나가 하찮아 보였다. 엄마가 나를 보더니 안아 들었다. “성국아, 바나나 별로야?” [보쌈!] 나는 주방을 손가락으로 가리켰다. “어? 보쌈 달라고?” 끄덕. 무거운 고개를 힘차게 끄덕였다. 동시에 아빠가 그릇 가득 잘 익은 돼지고기를 들고 나왔다. “자기야, 성국이가 보쌈 달라는데.” “성국이도 돌 지났으니까, 연한 살코기는 먹어도 될 것 같아서 조금 삶았어.” [역시 아빠!] 나는 까르르 웃으며 손바닥을 마구 쳤다. 사장은 나를 보곤 함박 미소를 지었다. “엄마, 아빠 닮아서 아주 인물이 좋아. 성국아, 나중에 잘되면 우리 보쌈집 모델 해줄 거지?” [보쌈집 모델은 사양할게, 사장. 내 품위에 안 어울린다고.] “당연하죠, 사장님. 그땐 돈도 안 받을게요.” [내 인생에 공짜는 없어, 아빠.] 사장은 얼른 다른 테이블의 서빙을 마치고는 아빠를 의자에 앉혔다. “아들 첫 광고인데, 같이 봐야지.” 이때, 옆에서 우리 대화를 들은 손님들이 물었다. “누가 광고 찍었어요?” “요 녀석이 이번에 삼전 전자 광고 찍었어요. 우리 식당 매니저 아들이에요. 이쁘죠?” 사장이 얼른 설명을 덧붙였다. “그럼, 우리도 광고 보고 먹게 천천히 줘요.” “그래도 될까요?” “대신 얼른 술이나 주세요. 축배 들어야죠.” “제가 오늘 손님들한테 소주 한 병씩 서비스로 다 드릴게요!” 보쌈집 사장은 냉장고에서 소주를 꺼내 테이블로 날랐다. 아빠도 얼른 손을 걷어붙이고 도왔다. 이때, 한 손님이 소리 질렀다. “TV 가리지 말고, 두 사람도 어서 앉아요.” 아빠가 위생 모자를 벗으며 엄마 앞에 앉았다. 내 광고가 나오기 5분 전이었다. “사장님도 어서 오세요. 같이 봐야죠.” “당연하지.” 사장은 냉장고에서 소주까지 꺼내와 자리에 앉았다. 모두 들뜬 얼굴로 TV를 주시했다. “자기랑 이렇게 보니까 너무 좋다. 우리 성국이 이쁘게 나오겠지?” “나도 궁금해 죽겠어. 오늘 하루 종일 일이 손에 제대로 안 잡혔다니까.” 후루룩. 후루룩. 나는 어느새 아빠가 삶은 야들야들한 보쌈 고기를 쪽쪽 빨고 있었다. 대한민국 최고의 셰프들이 한 고기 요리를 모두 섭렵한 내 입맛에도 꽤 훌륭한 맛이었다. [아빠, 내가 허투루 하는 말이 아니라 요리에 재능이 있는 것 같아.] “우리 성국이는 아빠 보면서 뭘 이리 종알거릴까.” “자기야, 드라마 시작한대. 이제 나올 건가 봐.” 가게 안의 모두의 시선이 TV로 향했다. 엄마와 아빠는 내 손을 꼭 잡고 마치 월드컵 결승전을 기다리듯이 광고를 기다렸다. 엄마와 아빠의 두 손이 축축해지는 게 느껴질 정도였다. TV에 드디어 빨래 바구니를 든 임선미가 등장했다. 그리고 익숙한 내용이 흐르고, 드디어 내 목소리가 흘러나왔다! - 아빠? 가게 안은 잠시 정적이 흘렀다. 아빠와 엄마는 감격에 겨운 얼굴로 보쌈 고기를 쪽쪽 빨고 있는 나를 쳐다봤다. [뭐 이런 걸로 감격하긴.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. 사장이 내 머리를 마구 쓰다듬었다. “아이고, 이뻐라. 우리 성국이 TV로 보니까 더 이쁘네!” [귀찮았지만, 아버지의 보스니 내 보스기도 하니 좀 웃어줄게.] 히죽히죽. “웃으니까 더 이쁘네. 나도 저 통돌이 세탁기로 이번에 바꿔야겠네.” “엄마, 아빠 인물도 워낙 좋아서, 커서도 이 녀석 한 인물 하겠어.” “여자 여러 명 울리겠네.” 가게에 있던 손님들도 한마디씩 했다. “기분이다. 보쌈 포장도 하나 해주세요. 집에서 공부할 우리 아들 가져다줘야겠네.” 주문까지 밀려들었다. 사장은 얼른 자리에서 일어났다. “지성 씨, 내가 주방은 잠시 볼 테니 먹고 들어와.” “아니에요. 저도 성국이한테 인사만 하고 곧 갈게요.” 아빠가 나를 안아 들어 등을 도닥였다. “우리 성국이 장하다. 장해.” [나, 전성국이야.] “알지, 알지. 고생 많이 했어. 아빠가 우리 성국이 선물 사줘야 할 것 같은데. 뭐가 좋을까.” [선물?] 돌이 갓 지난 나에게 필요한 건 딱히 없었다. 고작해야 전복과 소고기가 가득 들어간 이유식뿐이었다. 그래도 선물을 준다니 살짝 흥분됐다. 회귀 전에 나에게 주어진 선물은 이런 거였다. 열 살 생일 파티를 놀이동산 통째로 빌려서 하기. 대학 입학 선물로 강남 최고가 주상복합 펜트하우스 독립. 한도 없는 신용 카드. 차와 시계는 수시로 선물받아서 선물이라고 생각도 되지 않을 지경이었다. 그렇다면 이 가난한 엄마와 아빠가 나에게 해줄 선물은 뭘까? 나, 기대해도 될까?","completion":"Episode 8 While gobbling down the baby food, the girl with the bob haircut was tearing into a chicken leg. Mom was beside her, only eating the dry breast meat, mindful of the landlord's watchful eyes. The girl with the bob haircut offered the remaining leg to Mom. \\"Eat this.\\" \\"You eat it, sis. I'm okay.\\" \\"Stop torturing yourself with that dry meat and eat this. I've had enough.\\" \\"Thank you.\\" Only then did Mom accept the leg. Even as I slurped down my baby food, I watched the girl with the bob haircut. If only I had more teeth and could control my tongue better, I would have asked her outright... It was frustrating. \\"But sis, why are you so nice to us?\\" [Mom, you're not entirely naive. That's exactly what I wanted to ask!] I rubbed my sleepy eyes and focused on their conversation. \\"It reminds me of myself.\\" \\"Why you?\\" \\"When I was in my early 20s, I really had nothing. I graduated from a women's commercial high school and got into the accounting department of my current company. Back then, there were many like me, but now I'm the only one left.\\" So that's why she's been a manager forever. Come to think of it, including Mom and Dad, there was no one in this house who had been to college. Before regression, going to college and even studying abroad were standard for my family. I was fluent in English, French, and Japanese, and I could hold a conversation in German and Chinese. My friends and colleagues were at least as educated as I was, if not more. The only high school graduates I knew were idols or artists with exceptional talent. \\"Sis, if you don't mind me asking, how did you manage to get this house just by working? You're amazing.\\" \\"Amazing? I got it through an auction.\\" \\"Auction?\\" [Auction... Is that like acquiring a bankrupt company or something?] The girl with the bob haircut continued in a calm tone. \\"My parents passed away early, and I have no siblings. So, I thought I needed money and saved up my salary obsessively to participate in auctions. I started with a basement studio and worked my way up to here.\\" \\"That's incredible, sis! Can you teach me too? Sunguk's dad works hard too, but when Sunguk grows up, I want to try doing various jobs.\\" [Hmm, real estate.] I stroked my chin with my short fingers. Although I wasn't born with a silver spoon, there are only two things you need to do well in South Korea. Real estate and stocks. It was the only way for someone from a poor background to taste a bit of a golden spoon. I perked up my ears. I had heard of auctions, but I never had to buy a house through one. It was never necessary. But now, born into a poor family, I needed to know everything to lift us out of poverty. \\"Sunguk's family is expecting a second child soon. Let's save up and get a house quickly. You know, being a baby model isn't something to scoff at. Some baby models, starting with commercials, can earn as much as our manager's annual salary in a month.\\" \\"Wow, that's a whole new world.\\" Mom, holding a chicken leg, was amazed. I was right. A monthly salary of 500,000 won. Dust gathered is still dust. To lift this poor household, I had to step up. But why am I so sleepy? My heavy head kept diving towards the ground. Mom quickly picked me up. \\"Sunguk, we need to wash up and sleep...\\" [I'm sleepy. I can't do anything.] \\"Sunguk, let's just brush our teeth.\\" [I can't. I can't.] The girl with the bob haircut smiled at me. \\"Sunguk really seems to understand everything Mom and Dad say.\\" [Of course... I understand everything. Be careful... girl with the bob haircut.] * * * The commercial was scheduled to air two weeks after the shoot, as the director personally informed us. It was right before a weekend drama that nearly reached a 50% viewership rating. Mom and I decided to watch the commercial at Dad's workplace, as he couldn't take the weekend off. It was my first time visiting Dad's workplace. Finally, an opportunity to see Dad's financial situation and working conditions firsthand. Mom, holding her swollen belly, stopped several times before pausing in front of a small restaurant in a bustling area near our home. <Mr. Won's Bossam> [Sigh... With a name like that...] I couldn't help but sigh. As Mom opened the door and entered, the size of the restaurant was immediately apparent. It was a small establishment with only eight tables. The kitchen was located at the very back. Whether it was designed with a traditional Korean house in mind or not, the ceiling was adorned with rafters. The place was filled with tacky decorations. [Sigh...] I sighed again. There seemed to be no future in this restaurant. A middle-aged man, who was cleaning the tables, greeted us. \\"Ah, Sunguk's mom is here.\\" \\"Mr. Owner, how have you been?\\" \\"Ah, this must be the lucky charm, Sunguk.\\" Dad peeked out from the kitchen. \\"Soyoung, you're here?\\" \\"Yes, honey.\\" [Dad!] I waved my hand. This person was responsible for my baby food and diapers, the head of our household, so to speak. \\"Sunguk, I'll be out soon, so just wait a bit. Soyoung, take a seat in front of the TV.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Mom sat in front of the TV as instructed. The owner quickly came over and patted my forehead. \\"Jisung always brags about him. He's much cuter in person than in photos.\\" [Of course, you're stating the obvious...] As I grinned, the owner quickly got up and headed to the fridge. \\"Sunguk can't eat bossam yet, so I bought some bananas.\\" \\"We've already fed him baby food. You didn't have to.\\" \\"Jisung is indispensable to our restaurant. He said our bossam is the best, and it was his idea to switch from a tavern to a bossam specialty restaurant, which really helped us breathe a little easier.\\" I looked at Dad working in the kitchen again. Now that I think about it, the restaurant's interior didn't look like a typical bossam place. The traditional Korean house style, the rustic interior, and the tacky paintings and decorations scattered around... It felt like a tavern from a TV drama where poor commoners drink makgeolli. The owner continued excitedly. \\"Even though customers said our bossam was delicious, we never thought of competing with just that. But Jisung insisted on making bossam the main menu, keeping only a few side dishes for alcohol, saying it would be more profitable and tables would turn faster. And it really worked out well after we made the change.\\" The owner peeled a banana and offered it to me. Mom quickly cut it into small pieces and fed me. \\"Sunguk, eat slowly.\\" [I can't eat fast with these barely grown teeth.] I nibbled on the banana with my two barely emerged front teeth. Customers started pouring in. \\"Owner, go and take care of the customers.\\" \\"Alright, let's watch the commercial together later.\\" The owner hurriedly greeted the customers, and Mom and I waited for the commercial, watching TV. A savory smell wafted from the kitchen. [Smells delicious.] Saliva unknowingly dripped from my mouth. [Jeon Seonguk, what's with this lack of dignity?] Suddenly, the banana seemed so trivial. Mom looked at me and picked me up. \\"Sunguk, don't you like bananas?\\" [Bossam!] I pointed towards the kitchen. \\"Ah? You want bossam?\\" Nod. I vigorously nodded my heavy head. At that moment, Dad came out with a plate full of tenderly cooked pork. \\"Honey, Sunguk wants some bossam.\\" \\"Sunguk is over a year old now, so it should be fine for him to eat some tender meat. I boiled some just for him.\\" [That's my Dad!] I laughed heartily and clapped my hands. The owner smiled broadly at me. \\"Mom and Dad are both good-looking, so Sunguk is handsome too. Sunguk, will you be our bossam restaurant's model when you grow up?\\" [I'll pass on being a bossam restaurant model, owner. It doesn't suit my dignity.] \\"Of course, Mr. Owner. We won't even charge you then.\\" [There's no such thing as free in my life, Dad.] The owner quickly served other tables and then sat Dad down. \\"It's your son's first commercial, so we should watch it together.\\" At that moment, a customer who overheard our conversation asked. \\"Who filmed a commercial?\\" \\"This little guy here filmed a commercial for Samsung Electronics. He's the manager's son of our restaurant. Cute, isn't he?\\" The owner quickly added. \\"Then, let's watch the commercial before we eat.\\" \\"Is that okay?\\" \\"Just bring us some alcohol first. We need to toast.\\" \\"I'll give a bottle of soju to each table as a service today!\\" The bossam restaurant owner fetched soju from the fridge and rushed to the tables. Dad also rolled up his sleeves to help. Then, a customer shouted. \\"Don't block the TV, both of you sit down too.\\" Dad took off his hygiene cap and sat in front of Mom. My commercial was about to start in 5 minutes. \\"Mr. Owner, come sit too. We should watch it together.\\" \\"Of course.\\" The owner brought soju from the fridge and took a seat. Everyone watched the TV with excited faces. \\"It's so nice to watch this with you. Our Sunguk will look beautiful, right?\\" \\"I'm dying of curiosity. I couldn't focus on work all day.\\" Slurp. Slurp. I was already sucking on the tender bossam meat Dad had boiled. The taste was quite excellent, even to my palate, which had savored dishes from Korea's top chefs. [Dad, I'm not just saying this, but you seem to have a talent for cooking.] \\"Our Sunguk is babbling so much while looking at Dad.\\" \\"Honey, the drama has started. It's about to come on.\\" Everyone in the restaurant focused on the TV. Mom and Dad held my hands tightly, as if waiting for the World Cup final to start. Their hands were sweaty with anticipation. Finally, Lim Sunmi appeared on TV, holding a laundry basket. The familiar content flowed, and then my voice came out! - Dad? The restaurant fell silent for a moment. Mom and Dad, overwhelmed with emotion, looked at me sucking on the bossam meat. [What's there to be emotional about.] I shrugged my shoulders. The owner ruffled my hair. \\"Ah, so cute. Our Sunguk looks even cuter on TV!\\" [I'll smile a bit since you're Dad's boss, and thus my boss too.] Grin. Grin. \\"You're even cuter when you smile. I should switch to that drum washing machine too.\\" \\"Mom and Dad are both so good-looking, this kid will be quite the catch when he grows up.\\" \\"He'll break many hearts.\\" The other customers in the restaurant also chimed in. \\"I'm in a good mood. Please pack a serving of bossam for me. I'll take it home for my son who's studying.\\" Orders started to pile up. The owner quickly stood up. \\"Jisung, I'll take a look at the kitchen for a while, so go ahead and eat.\\" \\"No, I'll just greet Sunguk and then go.\\" Dad picked me up and patted my back. \\"Our Sunguk did great. Great job.\\" [I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.] \\"I know, I know. You worked hard. I think Dad should buy Sunguk a present. What would be good?\\" [A present?] There wasn't much I needed, barely a year after my birthday. At most, baby food filled with abalone and beef. But the idea of receiving a gift was slightly exciting. Before regression, the gifts given to me were like this: Renting an entire amusement park for my 10th birthday party. A penthouse in Gangnam's most expensive residential complex as a college entrance gift. A credit card with no limit. Cars and watches were given so frequently that they didn't even feel like gifts anymore. So, what could my poor mom and dad possibly give me as a gift? Can I, Jeon Seonguk, look forward to it?"},{"prompt":"제10화 “웃는 것도 장난 아니게 이쁘네. 나는 재현이야. 성국아. 잘 부탁해.” 눈웃음을 장착한 재현이 다가왔다. 재현은 꽃미남과로 인기가 많았는데, 나중에 복잡한 여자 문제로 여러 번 가십에 오르내린다. “안녕, 난 범선이야. 형이라고 불러라. 아니지, 형님인가. 그건 또 조폭 같나.” [어이, 범선! 오랜만이야.] 범선과 나랑은 꽤 인연이 있었다. 범선은 아이돌 사이에서 일명 배우상으로, 나중에 마초적인 매력의 배우로 성공적으로 전향한다. 삼전 그룹에서 후원하는 영화제에서 남우주연상을 수상하고 뒤풀이 자리에서 오래 술을 마신 기억이 있다. 술 매너도 좋고, 무엇보다 의리가 있었다. 삼전 그룹에서 후원하는 영화제라 평소라면 안 가던 뒤풀이도 갔었다. [이제 마지막 한 명이 남았는데….] “왓썹. 난 마이클이야. 잘 부탁해.” 건들건들한 포즈에 느끼한 면상. 거기다 이름도 버터 냄새 나는 마이클. 재미교포 출신인 이 녀석은 나중에 사고란 사고는 다 치고 다닌다. 여자와 돈 문제까지 얽히고 얽혀서 나름 국민 아이돌이란 칭호를 얻은 ‘저스트’의 얼굴에 먹칠하는 멤버이다. 마이클이 손으로 내 뺨을 슬쩍 건드렸다. 손가락에서 담배 냄새가 났다. [이 자식이 감히 담배 피운 손으로 날 건드려?!] 내가 미간을 찌푸리자 마이클이 어이없단 얼굴로 나를 봤다. “뭐야, 얘 나 싫어하나 봐.” 마이클은 혀 꼬부라진 말투로 나를 자극했다. 나는 고개를 휙 돌렸다. “너 담배 피우고 왔지? 나도 싫은데, 애는 좋겠니?” 리더인 태형이 핀잔을 주자, 마이클은 영어로 중얼거리며 구석에 찌그러졌다. 나는 다시 평온한 얼굴로 이들을 바라봤다. 엄마는 볼록 나온 배를 만지며 신기한 얼굴로 ‘저스트’를 보느라 정신없었다. 특히 잘생긴 범선을 넋 놓고 바라봤다. [엄마, 정신 차려!] 내가 잡아당기자 엄마는 얼른 정신을 차리고 나를 안았다. “성국아, 오빠들 진짜 잘생겼어.” [엄마보다도 어린 애도 있어.] 속내와 다르게 나는 고개를 끄덕이곤 비즈니스 대답을 해줬다. “응!” 이제 돌도 지나서 어색하지만 걷기도 시작했고, 옹알이를 벗어난 수준의 단어도 가끔 내뱉을 수 있게 혀가 돌아갔다. [엄마, 저 얼굴에 속으면 안 돼. 얼굴에 분칠하는 것들 말은 믿으면 안 된다는 말도 있잖아.] 엄마는 내 속도 모르고 저스트를 보며 싱글벙글 웃기만 했다. 감독이 들어오자 저스트가 일렬로 서서 동시에 꾸벅 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요! 대한민국 가요계를 이끌어갈 저스트입니다!” “반가워. 다들 이야기는 들었지?” “네.” 태형이 대표로 대답했다. “너희 숙소에서 3일 정도 촬영할 건데. 성국이는 아침 9시에 나와서 6시까지 촬영하고, 하루만 숙소에서 잘 거야. 그냥 생활 예능이니까, 최대한 자연스럽게. 나중에 편집으로 우리가 캐릭터는 다 만들어줄게.” “감사합니다! 감독님!” “숙소에서는 그렇게 각 잡지들 마. 옷들도 원래 입던 것들 입고. 메이크업도 최대한 하지 말고.” “네!” 감독은 이제 내게 눈길을 줬다. “성국이 칭찬은 곽 감독한테 많이 들었어요. 말귀를 그렇게 잘 알아듣는다면서요?” “저희도 깜짝깜짝 놀랄 때가 있어요.” “참, 주의 사항 아시죠?” “방송 시작하고 6개월 동안은 광고 금지요?” “네. 파일럿 날려보고 안 되면 금방 접을 수도 있어요. 이렇게라도 방송 타면 나중에 광고 모델 하는 건 더 유리할 거예요.” 엄마는 감독의 이야기를 귀 기울여 들었다. 감독은 우선 3일 정도 촬영한 것을 바탕으로 파일럿 프로그램을 만들어서 내보낸 후에 정규 편성 논의를 할 거라고 했다. “근데 어머니, 만삭이시네요.” “다음 달이 출산 예정일이에요.” “얼른 찍어야겠네요. 근데 반응 좋으면 정규 들어갈 텐데, 어머니가 안 오면 성국이 불안해하고 그러지 않나요?” “저도 그게 걱정인데요…. 성국이는 낯은 안 가려요.” [엄마, 나 완전 프로야. 걱정이란 것은 하지도 마.] 감독이 내 볼을 귀엽다는 듯이 잡아당겼다. “이 자식, 진짜 말귀 알아듣는 얼굴이네요. 완전 걱정 말란 얼굴이잖아요. 우선 촬영해보죠. 파일럿이 잘돼야 다음도 있는 거니까요.” “잘 부탁드립니다, 감독님.” 엄마는 부른 배를 안고 고개 숙여 인사했다. 나도 엄마를 따라 배꼽에 두 손을 딱 모으고 인사했다. [앞으로 잘 부탁해, 감독. 이 은혜는 내가 성공하면 몇 배로 갚을 테니 걱정 마.] * * * 드디어 첫 촬영이 시작됐다. 내가 할 일은 말갛게 씻은 얼굴로 촬영장으로 향하는 것뿐이었다. 나는 이미 이 프로그램의 끝까지 모두 알고 있었다. 동글동글 귀여운 눈으로 잘 웃고, 잘 울면 멤버들 역시 나를 이해하고 같이 웃고 울고 하는 거였다. 나와 엄마는 방송국에서 보내준 차를 타고 촬영 장소인 ‘저스트’의 숙소로 향했다. 반지하 숙소 인근은 이미 스태프와 각종 촬영 장비도 가득했다. 엄마가 나를 안고 내리자 조연출이 다가와서 얼른 내 상태를 확인했다. “성국이 컨디션 괜찮죠?” “잠도 잘 자고, 아침도 먹였어요.” “좋네요. 그럼 30분 후에 촬영 들어가겠습니다. 조금만 대기해 주세요.” “네.” 엄마와 나는 다시 차 안에서 30분을 기다렸다. 대기 시간 동안 엄마는 가져온 책을 읽어줬다. <왕자와 거지>였다. 똑같은 얼굴을 한 왕자와 거지가 서로의 일상을 바꿔 살아본다는 내용의 동화이다. [이거 내 이야기잖아.] 재벌이었을 때, 이 이야기를 읽으면서 그런 생각을 했다. 절대 단 하루라도 누군가와 인생을 바꿀 생각 따위는 하지 말아라. 왜냐하면 재벌의 삶이란 모두가 부러워하는 삶이기 때문이다. 나는 생각에 잠겨 고개를 끄덕였다. “성국아, 그림만 봐도 재미있어?” 나는 대충 고개를 끄덕였다. 저들은 아마 내가 어떤 생각과 경험을 가진 사람인지 아무도 모를 것이다. 한때는 삼전 그룹의 후계자였던 전성국이었다. 그 모든 왕좌의 짐을 내려놓은 게 지금의 전성국이었다. 똑. 똑. 차 문을 두드리는 소리가 들렸다. 엄마가 창을 내리자 조연출이 배시시 웃으며 나를 쳐다봤다. “촬영 곧 들어갈게요.” “녜에!” 나는 번쩍 손을 들었다. * * * 카메라가 돌아갔다. 나와 ‘저스트’ 주변을 에워싼 수십 명의 스태프들이 숨죽였다. ‘저스트’의 멤버들은 이미 대강 라인이 정해진 각본에 따라 각자 편안한 차림으로 거실에 모였다. ‘저스트’의 숙소였다. ‘저스트’의 숙소는 소속사와 가까운 30평대의 오래된 반지하 빌라였다. 아직 인기가 그렇게 많은 그룹은 아니어서 아파트나 주상복합으로 옮기지는 못한 모양이었다. 하지만 이게 더 정감 가고, 괜찮은 그림이 나올 것 같았다. 이른 아침, 띵동 초인종 소리가 들리고 막 잠에서 깬 멤버들이 나오면 문이 열리면서 아기 바구니에 든 내가 배달되는 장면부터 찍었다. 프로의 이름은 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’였다. 그 콘셉트에 충실한 오프닝이었다. 막 잠에서 깬 리더 태형이 아기 바구니를 들고 당황하며 멤버들을 불러 모았다. “얘들아, 이리 모여봐.” 멤버들은 그제야 상황을 파악하고 2박 3일 동안 함께할 나를 맞으러 모두 졸린 눈으로 나왔다. [연기들 좀 하는데?] 몇은 자연스레 머리도 헝클고 눈에 안 띄게 메이크업도 했다. 나는 잔뜩 겁에 질린 얼굴로 ‘저스트’ 멤버들을 한 명씩 눈으로 훑었다. [자, 이제 첫 장면이다. 낯선 곳에 왔으니 울어볼까?] 이게 내가 생각한 첫 장면이었다. 긴장감에 울음을 터트린 아기. 그 아기를 달래기 위해 최선을 다하는 ‘저스트’ 멤버! [음. 흠.] 나는 목을 풀고는 혼신을 다해서 울어재꼈다. “엄마앙! 아빠앙!” 나를 잽싸게 안아 든 것은 마이클이었다. [눈치 빠른 녀석.] 보나 마나 분량을 챙기려는 수작이다. 하지만 이 정도로 울음을 그치면 분량이 충분하지 않을 것 같은데…. 어쩔 수 없군. 나는 더 목 놓아 울어재꼈다. 곧바로 꽃미남 재현이 나를 빼앗듯이 안아 들었다. 나는 타이밍에 맞게 재현을 보고는 울음을 차츰 멈췄다. “애도 이쁜 사람 좋아하네.” 멤버들의 반응에 이번엔 덩치만 근육돌 루카스가 나를 안으려고 들었다. “성국아, 이리 와봐. 형이야, 형.” 낯선 장소에서 당황하는 모습. 마이클이 안아 들자 우는 장면에 이어 재현이 나를 안자 잠잠해지는 것까지는 계산된 상황이었다. 갑자기 루카스는 좀 당황스러웠다. [이 녀석과의 관계 설정을 어찌하지?] 순간, 루카스의 두툼한 손바닥이 눈앞에 보였다. 나는 얼른 루카스의 손바닥을 내 작은 손으로 콩 찍었다. 마치 놀이를 하듯이. “성국이도 루카스가 장난 좋아하는 거 단번에 알아보네. 루카스랑 놀려고 하나 봐.” 태형의 예상대로 나는 루카스를 친구로 설정했다. 듬직한 리더 태형은 아빠. 자상한 꽃미남 재현은 엄마. 근육돌 루카스는 친구. 낯가림이 있는 범선과는 어색한 사이. 장난치기 좋아하는 마이클과는 앙숙. 나는 얼른 머리로 관계 설정을 끝마쳤다. 그러곤 방긋 웃었다. [앞으로 잘 부탁해, ‘저스트’.] ‘저스트’ 멤버들이 모두 내 앞으로 모여들었다. “성국아, 앞으로 잘 지내보자.” 리더인 태형이 이야기하자 모두들 나를 향해 손을 흔들었다. 나는 조금 경계를 풀고는 어색하게 미소를 지었다. 낯설지만, 진심으로 나를 대하는 ‘저스트’와의 첫 만남 엔딩으로 이것만큼 좋은 것은 없어 보였다. “컷! 자, 다음 갑시다!” 감독의 만족스러운 목소리가 들렸다. * * * 쉬는 시간이 시작됐다. 이제 제법 배가 부른 엄마 옆에서 나는 ‘저스트’ 다섯 멤버들 분석을 시작한다. 집중하기 위해서 엄마의 뱃살에 얼굴을 콕 박았다. [엄마 냄새 조아. 헤헤.] “성국아, 엄마가 그렇게 좋아?” “녜에!” 나는 격하게 호응했다. 엄마는 환하게 웃으며 내 볼에 마구 뽀뽀를 해댔다. [엄마, 나도 이제 내일모레면 18개월이라고. 거기다 이제 동생도 생기는데 창피하게 왜 이래.] 내가 발버둥을 치자, 엄마는 나를 더 꼭 안았다. ‘저스트’의 맏형 태형이 달려오더니 간식과 물을 내밀었다. “어머니 피곤하지죠?” “아니에요.” “근데 어머니, 진짜 젊으세요.” [태형아, 너랑 동갑이야.] “그럼 어머니, 쉬시고 뭐 필요한 거 있으면 언제든 편하게 말씀하세요.” “감사해요. 정말로요.” 엄마는 배시시 웃으며 뒤돌아가는 태형의 뒷모습에서 눈을 떼지 못했다. [엄마, 대체 왜 그래? 혹 쟤들 잘생겨서 그러는 거야? 어?] 엄마는 태형이 건넨 간식을 먹으며 연신 미소를 지었다. “성국아, 저스트 멤버들 다 너무 잘생겼어.” [엄마, 내가 아빠한테 다 이를 거야!] “성국아, 이건 아빠한테 비밀!” 엄마가 내 입에 입을 쪽 맞췄다. [이러면 마음 약해지는데….] “자, 이제 촬영 다시 시작합니다!” 조연출의 목소리가 들렸다. 엄마는 나를 안고 촬영장으로 향했다. 나는 두 손을 쫙 펴서 머리를 뒤로 넘기고, 내복을 탁탁 털었다. [자. 촬영 시작해볼까.] * * * 엄마와 함께하는 낮 촬영은 대부분 순조롭게 진행됐다. 엄마가 카메라 뒤에 어딘가에 있었고, 나는 카메라를 의식하지 않은 채 자유롭게 행동하기만 해도 다들 귀엽다고 난리였다. 그리고 내가 밤을 꼬박 ‘저스트’ 멤버들과 함께 보내야 하는 마지막 날 밤의 촬영이 다가왔다. 엄마는 임산부였기 때문에 아빠와 함께 근처 작은 호텔에서 잠을 자기로 했다. 혹시라도 있을 사건 사고에 대비하기 위해서 연출팀 몇 명이서 돌아가는 카메라를 주시했다. 그래도 안심이 안 되는지, 아빠는 임산부인 엄마만 호텔에 데려다주고 촬영팀과 함께 밤새 숨을 죽이고 카메라를 관찰했다. 감독도 떠나면서 나에게 딱 하나만 당부했다. “성국아, 그냥 잘 자고 잘 먹고 잘 싸면 돼.” [걱정 마, 감독. 내가 안 하려고 해도 이 나이엔 그게 조절이 안 돼.] 감독은 ‘저스트’ 멤버들에게도 단단히 주의를 줬다. “성국이는 18개월밖에 안 된 아기야. 다들 알지?” “네!” “진짜 조심해야 해.” “감독님, 걱정 마세요. 제가 있잖아요.” 마이클이 넉살 좋게 다가갔다. “그래, 너만 믿는다.” 세상에서 단 한 명을 믿지 말라면 그건 바로 마이클이었다. 곧 촬영팀이 나가는 장면을 촬영하고는, 관찰 카메라 두 대만이 구석에서 돌아갔다. “성국이 저녁 누가 준비할래?” 태형이 멤버들에게 물었다. 그러자 마이클이 얼른 나섰다. “내가 할게!” “네가?” 멤버들은 모두 의아한 얼굴로 마이클을 쳐다봤다. “진짜 네가 한다고?” 재현의 얼굴만 봐도 마이클 이 녀석, 분량 챙기려는 욕심이 분명하다.","completion":"Episode 10 \\"Your smile is seriously pretty. I'm Jaehyun. Please take good care of me, Sunguk.\\" Jaehyun, with his eye-smile, approached. He was popular for his flower-boy looks but later got involved in complicated issues with women, becoming a frequent subject of gossip. \\"Hi, I'm Beomseon. Call me 'hyung'. Or is it 'hyungnim'? That sounds a bit gangster, though.\\" [Hey, Beomseon! Long time no see.] Beomseon and I had quite a connection. Known among idols as the 'actor type', he later successfully transitioned into an actor known for his macho charm. I remember him winning Best Actor at a film festival sponsored by Samjeon Group and drinking late into the night at the after-party. He had good manners when drinking and, above all, was loyal. I even attended the after-party of a film festival sponsored by Samjeon Group, which I normally wouldn't have. [Now, only one person is left...] \\"Whatsup. I'm Michael. Nice to meet you.\\" A swaggering pose with a smug face. And even his name, Michael, reeked of butter. This Korean-American guy later caused all sorts of trouble, from issues with women to money, tarnishing the reputation of 'Just', a group once known as the national idols. Michael lightly touched my cheek with his hand, which smelled of cigarettes. [How dare this guy touch me with his cigarette-smelling hand?!] I frowned, and Michael looked at me as if he couldn't believe it. \\"What, does he not like me?\\" Michael teased me with a twisted tongue. I turned my head away. \\"You smoked before coming here, didn't you? I don't like it, and what about the kid?\\" When Taehyung, the leader, scolded him, Michael mumbled something in English and slunk away to a corner. I looked back at them with a calm face. Mom was busy admiring 'Just', especially the handsome Beomseon, with a fascinated expression on her protruding belly. [Mom, snap out of it!] When I tugged at her, Mom quickly came to her senses and held me. \\"Sunguk, the oppas are really handsome.\\" [There are even kids younger than you, Mom.] Despite my inner thoughts, I nodded and gave a business-like response. \\"Yes!\\" Now that I was past my first birthday, I had started walking awkwardly and could occasionally utter words beyond babbling. [Mom, don't be fooled by their looks. There's a saying that you shouldn't trust those who paint their faces.] Mom, oblivious to my thoughts, just kept smiling at 'Just'. When the director entered, 'Just' lined up and bowed in unison. \\"Hello! We are 'Just', leading the Korean music scene!\\" \\"Nice to meet you all. You've heard the story, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Taehyung answered on behalf of the group. \\"We'll be filming at your dorm for about 3 days. Sunguk will come out at 9 AM and film until 6 PM, and he'll spend one night at the dorm. It's just a reality show, so act as naturally as possible. We'll create the characters through editing later.\\" \\"Thank you, Director!\\" \\"Don't be too stiff at the dorm. Wear your usual clothes. Try to wear minimal makeup.\\" \\"Yes!\\" The director then turned his attention to me. \\"I've heard a lot of praise about Sunguk from Director Kwak. They say he understands everything so well?\\" \\"We're often surprised too.\\" \\"Remember the rule, right? No commercials for 6 months after the broadcast starts?\\" \\"Yes. If the pilot doesn't work out, we might cancel it quickly. But appearing on the show now will be advantageous for future commercial modeling.\\" Mom listened intently to the director's words. The director explained that they would create a pilot program based on the first 3 days of filming and then discuss regular scheduling. \\"But, Mom, you're heavily pregnant.\\" \\"My due date is next month.\\" \\"We need to film quickly then. But if the response is good and we go regular, won't Sunguk be anxious without you?\\" \\"That's what I'm worried about... But Sunguk doesn't really get shy.\\" [Mom, I'm a total pro. Don't even worry.] The director playfully pinched my cheek. \\"This kid really does seem to understand everything. He's telling us not to worry. Let's start filming. The future depends on how well the pilot does.\\" \\"Thank you, Director.\\" Mom bowed with her swollen belly, and I mimicked her, placing my hands on my belly button in salute. [Take care, Director. I'll repay this kindness several times over once I succeed.] * * * Finally, the first day of filming began. My only task was to head to the set with a freshly washed face. I already knew everything about this program from start to finish. With my round, cute eyes, smiling and crying well would make the members understand and laugh and cry with me. Mom and I took the car provided by the broadcasting station to 'Just's dorm, the filming location. The area around the semi-basement dorm was already filled with staff and various filming equipment. As Mom carried me out of the car, the assistant director quickly came over to check on me. \\"Is Sunguk's condition okay?\\" \\"He slept well and had breakfast.\\" \\"Great. We'll start filming in 30 minutes. Please wait a bit.\\" \\"Okay.\\" Mom and I waited in the car for another 30 minutes. During the waiting time, Mom read me a book. It was \\"The Prince and the Pauper.\\" A fairy tale about a prince and a pauper with identical faces swapping their lives. [This is my story.] When I was a chaebol, I thought about this story. Never even think about swapping lives with someone for a single day. Because the life of a chaebol is envied by everyone. I nodded thoughtfully. \\"Sunguk, is it fun just looking at the pictures?\\" I casually nodded. They probably have no idea what kind of thoughts and experiences I have. I was once Jeon Seonguk, the heir to the Samjeon Group. And now, I've laid down all the burdens of that throne. Knock. Knock. There was a knock on the car door. As Mom rolled down the window, the assistant director smiled brightly at me. \\"We're about to start filming.\\" \\"Yess!\\" I raised my hand high. * * * The camera started rolling. Dozens of staff members surrounding me and 'Just' held their breath. The members of 'Just' had already gathered in the living room, dressed comfortably according to the roughly outlined script. It was 'Just's dorm. Located close to their agency, it was an old semi-basement villa of about 30 pyeong. Since they weren't that popular yet, they hadn't moved to an apartment or a mixed-use complex. But this seemed more intimate and likely to produce better scenes. The opening scene was filmed with the doorbell ringing early in the morning, the members waking up, and me being delivered in a baby basket. The show was titled \\"Five Men and a Baby Basket,\\" sticking true to its concept. Leader Taehyung, just woken up, carried the baby basket in confusion and gathered the members. \\"Guys, come here.\\" Only then did the members grasp the situation and came out with sleepy eyes to meet me, who they would be spending the next 2 nights and 3 days with. [Are they acting?] Some naturally had messy hair and subtly applied makeup. I scanned each member of 'Just' with a terrified face. [Now, the first scene. Should I cry since I'm in a strange place?] This was my planned first scene. A baby bursting into tears from tension. The 'Just' members doing their best to soothe the baby! [Hmm. Ahem.] I cleared my throat and cried with all my might. \\"Mommy! Daddy!\\" Michael was the first to quickly hold me. [A quick-witted guy.] Obviously, he was trying to grab some screen time. But stopping my crying now wouldn't be enough for a good scene... No choice then. I cried even louder. Soon, the handsome Jaehyun snatched me up. I looked at Jaehyun and gradually stopped crying, timing it perfectly. \\"Even the baby likes pretty people.\\" The members reacted, and then the muscular Lucas tried to hold me. \\"Sunguk, come here. I'm your hyung, your brother.\\" The scene of me panicking in a strange place and crying when Michael held me, followed by calming down when Jaehyun held me, was all planned. Suddenly, Lucas was a bit perplexing. [How should I set up my relationship with this guy?] Lucas's thick palm appeared before my eyes. I quickly tapped Lucas's palm with my small hand, as if playing a game. \\"Sunguk seems to recognize that Lucas likes to play. Looks like he wants to play with Lucas.\\" As Taehyung predicted, I set Lucas as a friend. The reliable leader Taehyung as dad. The caring handsome Jaehyun as mom. Muscle man Lucas as a friend. An awkward relationship with the shy Beomseon. And a playful rivalry with Michael. I quickly finished setting up the relationships in my head. Then I smiled brightly. [Looking forward to working with you, 'Just'.] All members of 'Just' gathered around me. \\"Sunguk, let's get along well.\\" As leader Taehyung spoke, everyone waved at me. I relaxed a bit and smiled awkwardly. Despite the unfamiliarity, the sincere first meeting with 'Just' seemed like the perfect ending. \\"Cut! Let's move on to the next scene!\\" The director's satisfied voice was heard. * * * Break time began. Next to my now full-bellied mom, I started analyzing the five members of 'Just'. To concentrate, I buried my face in Mom's belly. [Mom's scent is nice. Hehe.] \\"Sunguk, do you like Mom that much?\\" \\"Yess!\\" I responded enthusiastically. Mom laughed brightly and showered my cheeks with kisses. [Mom, I'm almost 18 months old now. And I'm about to have a sibling, why are you embarrassing me like this?] As I squirmed, Mom hugged me tighter. 'Just's eldest member, Taehyung, rushed over and offered snacks and water. \\"Are you tired, Mom?\\" \\"No, not at all.\\" \\"But, Mom, you're really young.\\" [Taehyung, you're the same age as her.] \\"Then, Mom, rest up, and if you need anything, feel free to ask anytime.\\" \\"Thank you. Really.\\" Mom smiled bashfully and couldn't take her eyes off Taehyung as he walked away. [Mom, why are you like this? Is it because they're handsome? Huh?] Mom ate the snacks Taehyung gave her, smiling continuously. \\"Sunguk, all the members of 'Just' are so handsome.\\" [Mom, I'm telling Dad everything!] \\"Sunguk, this is a secret from Dad!\\" Mom sealed my lips with a kiss. [This makes me go soft...] \\"Alright, let's start filming again!\\" The assistant director's voice was heard. Mom carried me to the set. I stretched my arms, pushed my hair back, and dusted off my onesie. [Let's start filming.]"},{"prompt":"apakah gilang masih ada?","completion":"Maaf, tetapi saya tidak memiliki informasi spesifik tentang individu atau data pribadi.

She might also have a corsage on her wrist, a common prom accessory. Teenage Boys: - **Outfits:** The boys could be wearing classic 80s prom attire, like pastel or brightly colored tuxedos with ruffled or sequined shirt fronts. One might go for a more conservative look with a black or white tuxedo but with a brightly colored tie or bow tie and cummerbund set to match the girl's dress color. - **Hairstyle:** For hair, think of popular 80s styles for men, such as feathered hair, mullets, or even a neatly styled afro if one of the characters is inclined to sport more of a throwback look from the 70s transitioning into the early 80s. - **Accessories:** They might be wearing patent leather shoes, and at least one of them could have a boutonniere pinned to his lapel that matches the girl’s corsage. # Pose: - The three teenagers could be standing together with the girl in the middle. - The girl could have one hand on her hip, holding her dress slightly aside, and the other resting on the shoulder of one of the boys. Each boy could have one hand in his trouser pocket and the other draped around the girl's waist or shoulder. - They would be smiling broadly, looking straight at the camera, capturing the joy and excitement of prom night.

Dalam biologi dan kedokteran modern, sperma (atau spermatozoa) dipahami sebagai sel reproduksi laki-laki yang terdiri dari berbagai komponen biologis dan kimia, bukan 'elemen' dalam arti klasik atau filosofis. Mari kita lihat apa itu sperma dari sudut pandang ilmiah: 1. **Kepala**: Bagian paling depan dari sperma yang mengandung inti, di mana terdapat material genetik (DNA) dari laki-laki. Kepala sperma juga dilapisi oleh sebuah struktur yang disebut akrosom, yang berisi enzim yang penting untuk proses fertilisasi dengan menembus lapisan luar ovum (sel telur). 2. **Lekukan Akrosom**: Wilayah kecil antara kepala dan bahu, mengandung mekanisme penting untuk melepaskan enzim akrosom. 3. **Badan atau Bagian Tengah**: Mengandung mitokondria, yang menyediakan energi yang diperlukan untuk pergerakan sperma. 4. **Ekor atau Flagel**: Komponen panjang yang berfungsi untuk memberikan motilitas kepada sperma, memungkinkannya untuk berenang menuju sel telur. Dari penjelasan di atas, bisa disimpulkan bahwa sperma terdiri dari beberapa komponen utama yang berfungsi bersama-sama untuk memastikan sel sperma bisa mencapai dan membuahi sel telur. Istilah 'empat elemen' mungkin mengacu pada struktur fisik utama sperma (kepala, lekukan akrosom, badan, dan ekor) tetapi istilah ini tidak secara akurat mencerminkan komposisi kimia atau biologis kompleks dari sel sperma itu sendiri. Dalam banyak tradisi filosofis dan simbolis kuno, empat elemen (tanah, air, udara, dan api) sering digunakan untuk menjelaskan prinsip dasar alam.

[나 전직 재벌인데, 왜 이렇게 없이 구는 거지?] 아빠는 늘 들고 다니는 낡은 손가방을 뒤지더니 뭔가 작고 얇은 것을 꺼내 내 눈앞에 가져다 댔다. [뭐야, 통장이잖아….] 나는 실망한 투로 옹알거렸다. “성국아. 이거 보여? 통장이야. 네가 이번에 광고 모델 해서 번 돈, 다 네 이름 앞으로 저축했어. 여기 네 이름으로 된 거 보여? 전성국.” 아빠는 내 눈앞에 ‘전성국’ 이름으로 만들어진 통장을 들이밀었다. 정말 모델료 받은 돈 한 푼도 빼놓지 않고 모두 입금된 통장이었다. 심지어 오디션 날 교통비로 받은 5만 원도 저축했다. [엄마, 아빠 바보야? 이걸 왜 고대로 저금해! 이 돈으로 집도 좀 옮기고, 하다못해 맨날 똑같은 옷 입고 다니는 엄마, 아빠 입을 옷이라도 사야지!] 나는 버럭 소리를 질렀지만, 금세 눈가가 촉촉해졌다. 세금 떼고 나면 채 400만 원도 안 되는 금액. 회귀 전에 나에게 이 돈은 그저 한 끼 식사 금액일 때도 있었고, 하룻밤 술값이 안 될 때도 있었다. 하지만 이들에게 이 돈은 한 남자가 식당에서 아침부터 저녁까지 일하고 받는 반년치 월급이었다. 그런 돈을 지금 한 푼도 안 쓰고 내 이름으로 모두 저축한 것이었다. “성국아, 이거 네가 번 거니까 다 네 거야. 엄마, 아빠는 하나도 안 건드렸어. 우리 성국이가 커서 학교 가면, 이 돈으로 배우고 싶은 거 있으면 엄마, 아빠가 다 시켜줄게.” [나 좀 그만 울리라고!] 나는 목이 멨다. “자기야, 우리 성국이 진짜 우리 말 알아듣나 봐. 눈시울이 붉어졌어.” “소영아, 성국이 진짜 감정이 풍부한 것 같아. 그래서 연기도 잘하나 봐.” 나는 작은 두 손으로 얼굴을 비벼댔다. 아빠가 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 이러면 얼굴 다쳐요. 우리 스타님.” [누가 울리래!] “자기야, 성국이 자다 깨서 졸린 것 같아. 내가 안을게.” “아니야, 소영아. 너 배 나와서 힘들잖아. 내가 안을게.” 아빠는 나를 안아서 어느새 등을 도닥였다. 식당에서 하루 종일 일하고 또 나를 안아 들었다. “성국아, 너는 정말 고아원에서 자라서 부모도 모르고 형제도 없는 우리 같은 사람들한테 온 복덩이야. 엄마, 아빠가 아직 많이 어려서 많이 부족하지? 그래도 엄마, 아빠가 진짜 열심히 살아서 우리 성국이는 부족한 거 없이 자라도록 노력할게. 성국아, 사랑해.” 크응. 나는 몰래 울음을 삼켰다. 회귀 전의 나에게 이렇게 따뜻했던 사람이 있었던가. 부모조차 나를 자식이 아닌 삼전 그룹의 후계자로 생각하고 따뜻한 말보다 혹독한 채찍을 가했다. 주변 사람들은 내가 삼전 그룹의 후계자라는 사실을 알면 어떻게든 내게 잘 보여 뭐라도 뜯어갈 생각만 했다. 나는 아빠 품에 폭 안겼다. 그리고 광고 속 그 한마디를 외쳤다. “아. 빠?” “소영아, 들었어?” 아빠가 들뜬 얼굴로 엄마를 쳐다봤다. 엄마는 내 엉덩이를 토닥였다. “자기야! 우리 성국이, 아빠 진짜 잘하지?” “소영아, 사실은… 우리 성국이가 엄마, 아빠 말을 너무 안 해서 사실 한동안 고민했거든.” 얼마 전까지 이들은 내가 크는 동안 양육을 담당하는 대리모와 대리부 정도의 존재였다. “그게, 성국이한테 내가 부족한 아빠라서 그런 게 아닌가 괜히 자격지심 들고 그랬는데, 이제야 마음이 놓이는 것 같아.” “자기야, 그런 생각 하지 마. 우리 성국이 진짜 아빠라는 말을 세상에서 제일 잘하는 애니까.” “그러게. 어! 성국이 자나 보다.” 이럴 때는 자는 척이라도 해줘야 할 것 같았다. 나도 눈치라는 게 있다. 스물세 살의 아빠와 그보다 어린 엄마. 둘만의 시간이 필요해 보였다. 나는 슬그머니 눈을 감았다. * * * 삼전 전자 CF를 찍은 곽 감독이 집 앞까지 찾아왔다. 곽 감독의 손에는 과일바구니가 들려 있었다. 오랜만에 보는 열대과일이었다. 나는 어느새 과일바구니를 향해 기어갔다. 애가 되더니 전에는 없던 식탐까지 생긴 모양이다. 얼른 멜론을 집어 들려는 순간, 엄마가 나를 안았다. [하아, 멜론 좋아하는데. 저기다 하몽 얹어서 와인 한 잔 하면 피로가 싹 가시는데….] 나는 입맛을 다셨다. 아빠가 얼른 감독에게 직접 탄 믹스 커피를 내밀었다. “감독님, 어쩐 일이세요?” “성국이가 요즘 엄청 핫한 거 아시죠?” “저희는 실감이 안 나요.” “그러실 만도 하죠. 오늘 제가 온 것은 다름이 아니라 성국이한테 제안을 하나 하려고요.” “제안이요?” 아빠가 되물었다. “이런 이야기 어려우실 수 있는데요. 지금 다른 광고 제안 들어와도 하지 마시고, 방송 하나를 하면 어떨까 해서요.” “광고도 더는 생각해보지 않았어요. 그런데 방송이라니….” [아빠, 원래 일이라는 것은 연달아 들어오는 법이야.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. “이번에 MVC 방송국 일요일 저녁 버라이어티 쇼에서 새로 신설되는 거거든요. 한 번도 아이를 키워본 적 없는 어린 남자 가수들이 아이를 키우는 거예요. 거기 성국이가 메인이고요.” [아, 그거!] 나는 기억을 떠올렸다. 남자 아이돌 그룹이 어린아이를 키우는, 육아 프로그램의 시조새쯤 되는 거였다. 물론 이건 당연히 해야 한다. 당대에는 물론, 후에도 무척이나 회자되는 육아 프로그램의 레전드였다. 아빠의 표정이 점점 어두워졌다. “감독님 제의는 감사하지만요….” 아빠는 말끝을 흐렸다. [아빠, 이건 아니지!] 나는 발버둥을 쳤지만, 아무도 내 이야기에 귀를 기울이진 않았다. 그렇다면! “으아앙! 으앙!” “성국아, 왜 그래?” 엄마가 얼른 나를 안았다. [왜 그러긴. 엄마, 아빠 좀 말려봐! 이건 내가 내 능력으로 따낸 황금 같은 기회라고!] 아빠는 생각한 말을 내뱉었다. “성국이가 자꾸 방송을 타면 다른 아이들과 다르게 자랄까 봐 걱정이 돼서요.” 나는 잠시 울음을 멈췄다. 의외의 대답인걸? 감독은 깊게 고개를 끄덕였다. “아버님, 고민 이해됩니다. 아무래도 방송에 노출되다 보면 사람들이 많이 알아보고 아이도 그 시선 속에서 자라게 되니까요.” 아빠는 고개를 끄덕였다. “저는 평범하게 아이를 키우고 싶습니다.” “하지만 아버님. 성국이는 정말 제가 본 다른 애들과 다릅니다. 외모도 외모지만, 타고난 재능이라는 게 보여요. 스스로 빛날 줄 아는 아이 같다는 말씀입니다. 그리고 요즘 부모들은 이런 방송 못 내보내서 난리거든요. 아이도 유명해지고 돈도 되니까요.” “…사실은 저희 부부가 모두 고아원에서 자랐거든요.” “아….” 감독은 놀라 아무 말도 못 했다. 아빠는 담담히 말을 이었다. “그래서 남의 손에 애를 맡기고 싶지 않았어요. 어릴 때만큼은 엄마, 아빠 사랑 듬뿍 받고 자라야 하는 거잖아요. 부족한 저희한테 찾아온 생명인데, 그래야 하잖아요.” 나는 주먹을 앙 쥐고 입을 틀어막았다. 눈시울이 뜨거워지는 것을 겨우 참아내고 있었다. [이번 생의 부모는 왜케 사연이 구구절절한 거야.] 감독도 어느새 붉어진 눈시울을 두 손으로 꾹 눌렀다. 나는 겨우 정신을 차리고 엄마 품을 벗어나 아빠에게 기어갔다. 아빠의 마음을 전부는 알 수 없지만, 아주 조금은 알 것 같았다. 하지만 이건 비즈니스이다. 나는 얼른 아빠의 무릎 나온 바지를 물고 뜯었다. [아빠, 지금도 사랑은 충분해. 돈이 많으면 더 많은 사랑을 줄 수도 있어!] 돈과 사랑의 비례는 일정할 때 최상의 시너지를 낸다. 돈이 너무 많아지거나, 사랑이 너무 많아지면 그때부터 문제가 생기는 법이다. 감독은 잠긴 목을 풀더니 아빠를 쳐다봤다. “아버님 뜻은 잘 알겠습니다.” [감독, 이렇게 포기하면 안 돼!] 감독은 나를 흘깃 보더니 다시 말을 이었다. “아버님, 그래도 한 번 잘 생각해 보세요. 두 분 사정 들으니 알 것 같지만, 부모님이 이렇게 사랑하고 생각해 주는데, 잠시 방송하는 건 크게 문제 될 것 없어 보이거든요. 출연도도 적지는 않을 거고요.” “저희는 돈 때문이 아니라요.” 아빠는 어렵게 말을 꺼냈다. 우리 아빠, 엄마의 행색을 보면 누구든 형편이 어렵다는 것은 단번에 알 수 있다. 나는 엄마의 허리를 꼭 껴안았다. [엄마, 걱정하지 마. 내가 10년 안에 부자 만들어 줄 테니까.] 감독이 엄마에게 안긴 나를 보더니 배시시 웃었다. “이런 말씀 이상할지 모르지만… 성국이는 진짜 사람 말 알아듣는 거 같아요. 아무튼 제가 오늘 드릴 제안은 이거였어요. 방송국 오디션을 보시는 게 어떻겠냐는 거죠. 대신, 이 방송 조건에 6개월 동안은 광고 금지예요.” 나는 얼른 아빠의 등짝을 팡팡 쳤다. [아빠, 이거야!] 아빠가 나를 내려다봤다. “성국이, 하고 싶어?” “네에!” 나는 자신 있게 대답했다. * * * 지금 내 눈앞에는 회귀 전에 내가 즐겨 듣던 <너만을 원해>를 부른 국민 아이돌 그룹 ‘저스트’ 다섯 명이 있었다. 물론 지금은 무명에서 조금 벗어난 신생 그룹 수준이었다. 이 녀석들은 몇 년 후에 엄청나게 성공해서 국민 아이돌 그룹이 된다. [내 열두 살 생일에 와서 노래도 부른 녀석들인데….] 나는 그날을 떠올렸다. 삼전 호텔의 가장 큰 연회장에서 열린 내 열두 살 생일에는 ‘저스트’뿐 아니라 막 떠오르는 여자 아이돌 그룹도 모두 참석했다. 그들의 첫 멘트는 이거였다. “전성국 도련님, 열두 번째 생일 축하드립니다!” 모두들 나와 아이 컨택 하려고 애썼었는데…. ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 나중에 나이를 먹은 후에 사석에서 몇 번 마주치기도 했다. 아이돌들이 대부분 그렇듯 몇은 배우, 몇은 생계형 방송인이 된다. 먼저 리더인 태형이 나에게 다가왔다. ‘저스트’는 본명을 쓰는 멤버도 있었고, 영어 이름을 쓰는 멤버도 있었다. “네가 아빠! 그 모델이구나. 형도 그 광고 봤어.” 리더이자 메인 래퍼인 태형은 잘생긴 얼굴에 토종 한국인임에도 불구하고 영어를 곧잘 해서 팀에서 브레인으로 통했다. 나중에 의류 사업 한다며 나대던 기억이 나는데, 인성도 크게 나쁘지 않고, 자기 이익은 잘 챙기는 스타일이라 재벌가의 먼 친척쯤 되는 여자랑 결혼해서 잘 산다. 그 뒤로 키가 유난히 큰 루카스가 다가왔다. 루카스는 덩치에 비해 웃는 모습은 순수해 보였다. 순진한 웃음에 근육질 몸매. 근육돌의 시초쯤 되는 녀석인데, 생긴 것처럼 성격도 단순한 체대 오빠 스타일로 여자들에게 인기가 많았다. “와, 장난 아니게 이쁘게 생겼네. 우리보다 성국이가 더 주목받겠는걸.” [그거야 당연한 말씀. 두고 보라고!]","completion":"Episode 9 Dad came home after 11 PM, having had another drink with the owner of the bossam (Korean boiled pork) restaurant. Today, Dad's hands were full of something. \\"Honey, what's all that?\\" \\"The owner gave me all sorts of things. He was making a fuss, bragging to the customers every time our commercial came on. The sales even doubled compared to other days.\\" \\"The owner is really a good person.\\" \\"Look at this. Seeing Seong-guk eat bossam so well earlier, he even packed some of the bossam meat they use at the restaurant separately for us.\\" I was half-asleep, listening to Mom and Dad's conversation. Dad continued to boast about various things. He was energized all day thanks to the commercial I was in, and the owner even complimented that the bossam he made now tastes almost as good as his. \\"Honey, the owner said he's raising my salary by 100,000 won starting next month because he switched to a bossam restaurant and the sales went up a lot.\\" \\"100,000 won! Seong-guk must really be a lucky charm. Ever since Seong-guk was born, your work has been going well, and I'm so happy.\\" Mom was moved, holding Dad's hands tightly over just 100,000 won. What can you do with 100,000 won? Maybe barely afford a meal at the Samjeon Hotel. As I rubbed my sleepy eyes, Dad approached me. \\"Seong-guk, you haven't slept?\\" [Technically, I was woken up. Because it was noisy.] \\"Should we give Seong-guk his present now?\\" Ah, there was a present. At that word, my eyes sparkled. [I used to be a chaebol, why am I acting so needy?] Dad rummaged through his old handbag he always carries and pulled out something small and thin in front of me. [What, it's a bankbook....] I mumbled in disappointment. \\"Seong-guk, see this? It's a bankbook. The money you earned from being a model for the commercial, I've saved it all in your name. See, it's under your name, Jeon Seong-guk.\\" Dad pushed the bankbook made out in 'Jeon Seong-guk's' name in front of me. It was a bankbook where not a single penny of the model fee I received was missing. Even the 50,000 won received for transportation on the audition day was saved. [Mom, Dad, are you fools? Why save it all like this! With this money, we could move houses, or at the very least, buy clothes for Mom and Dad who wear the same thing every day!] I yelled out loud, but soon my eyes became moist. After taxes, it wasn't even 4 million won. In my previous life, there were times when this amount was just the cost of a meal or not even enough for a night's drinking. But to them, this money was half a year's salary for a man working from morning till evening at a restaurant. They saved all that money in my name without spending a penny. \\"Seong-guk, since you earned this money, it's all yours. Mom and Dad didn't touch a single won. When Seong-guk grows up and goes to school, if there's anything you want to learn, Mom and Dad will support you with this money.\\" [Stop making me cry!] My throat was choked up. \\"Honey, Seong-guk really seems to understand us. His eyes are getting red.\\" \\"Seong-guk really seems to have rich emotions. Maybe that's why he acts so well.\\" I rubbed my face with my small hands. Dad held my hand. \\"Seong-guk, you'll hurt your face if you do that. Our star.\\" [Who asked you to make me cry!] \\"Honey, Seong-guk seems sleepy because he woke up. I'll hold him.\\" \\"No, So-young. You're pregnant and it's hard for you. I'll hold him.\\" Dad held me and soon patted my back. He held me after working all day at the restaurant. \\"Seong-guk, you're really a blessing to us, who grew up in an orphanage without knowing our parents or siblings. Mom and Dad are still very young and lacking, but we'll live diligently so Seong-guk can grow up without lacking anything. Seong-guk, we love you.\\" I secretly swallowed my tears. Did I ever have someone this warm to me before my regression? Even my parents thought of me not as their child but as the heir to the Samjeon Group, and instead of warm words, they often whipped me harshly. People around me, knowing I was the heir to the Samjeon Group, tried to show off to me in any way to rip something off me. I threw myself into Dad's arms. And I shouted that one line from the commercial. \\"Dad?\\" \\"So-young, did you hear?\\" Dad looked at Mom with an excited face. Mom patted my bottom. \\"Honey! Our Seong-guk, he's really good at calling Dad, right?\\" \\"So-young, actually... I've been worried for a while because Seong-guk doesn't talk much to Mom and Dad.\\" Until recently, they were just surrogates taking care of me as I grew up. \\"I thought maybe I was lacking as a father, and I felt unqualified, but now I feel relieved.\\" \\"Honey, don't think like that. Our Seong-guk is really the best at saying 'Dad' in the world.\\" \\"Right. Oh! Seong-guk seems to be asleep.\\" It seemed like I should pretend to be asleep at times like this. I also have tact. Dad and Mom, who are twenty-three and younger, seemed to need their own time. I quietly closed my eyes. * * * Director Kwak, who filmed the Samjeon Electronics CF, came to our house. In Director Kwak's hand was a fruit basket. It was tropical fruit I hadn't seen in a long time. I soon crawled towards the fruit basket. Becoming a child, I seemed to have developed a craving for food that I didn't have before. Just as I was about to grab a melon, Mom picked me up. [Ah, I like melon. If you put ham on it and have a glass of wine, the fatigue just disappears...] I smacked my lips. Dad quickly offered Director Kwak a cup of mixed coffee he made himself. \\"Director, what brings you here?\\" \\"Seong-guk is really hot these days, you know?\\" \\"We can't really feel it.\\" \\"I guess so. I came today to make a proposal to Seong-guk.\\" \\"A proposal?\\" Dad asked back. \\"It might be difficult to talk about this. Even if other commercial offers come in, don't accept them, and how about doing a broadcast?\\" \\"We haven't even thought about more commercials. But a broadcast...\\" [Dad, work usually comes in succession.] I shrugged my shoulders. \\"It's a new variety show on MVC Broadcasting Station on Sunday evenings. Young male singers who have never raised a child before will raise a child. Seong-guk will be the main character.\\" [Ah, that one!] I remembered. It was somewhat the pioneer of parenting programs where male idol groups raise a child. Of course, this was a must-do. It was a legendary parenting program that was talked about not only in its time but also long after. Dad's expression gradually darkened. \\"Thank you for the offer, Director, but...\\" Dad trailed off. [Dad, this isn't right!] I struggled, but no one listened to my story. Then! \\"Uwaaang! Uwaaang!\\" \\"Seong-guk, what's wrong?\\" Mom quickly held me. [Why? Mom, Dad, stop them! This is a golden opportunity I earned with my abilities!] Dad finally spoke his mind. \\"I'm worried that if Seong-guk keeps appearing on broadcasts, he might grow up differently from other children.\\" I briefly stopped crying. An unexpected answer, huh? Director Kwak nodded deeply. \\"Father, I understand your concern. Being exposed to broadcasts, people will recognize him a lot, and the child will grow up in those gazes.\\" Dad nodded. \\"I want to raise my child ordinarily.\\" \\"But, Father. Seong-guk is really different from other children I've seen. Not just his appearance, but you can see his natural talent. He seems like a child who knows how to shine on his own. And these days, parents are going crazy because they can't get their children on such broadcasts. The child becomes famous and it makes money.\\" \\"...Actually, both of us grew up in an orphanage.\\" \\"Ah...\\" Director Kwak couldn't say anything, surprised. Dad continued calmly. \\"So, we didn't want to leave our child in someone else's hands. A child should receive plenty of love from Mom and Dad while they're young, right? It's a life that came to us, who are lacking.\\" I clenched my fists and covered my mouth. I barely held back the tears welling up in my eyes. [Why does this life's parents have such a long story?] Director Kwak also pressed his reddened eyes with both hands. I barely regained my senses and crawled out of Mom's arms towards Dad. I might not fully understand Dad's heart, but I felt like I understood a little. But this is business. I quickly bit and tore at Dad's worn-out pants. [Dad, love is already enough now. If we have more money, we can give even more love!] The proportion of money to love is optimal when it's balanced. When there's too much money or too much love, that's when problems start to arise. Director Kwak cleared his throat and looked at Dad. \\"I understand Father's intention.\\" [Director, you can't give up like this!] Director Kwak glanced at me and continued. \\"Father, please think about it once more. I understand your situation after hearing it, but with parents who love and care for him like this, briefly doing a broadcast doesn't seem to be a big problem. The appearance fee won't be small either.\\" \\"We're not doing this for money.\\" Dad spoke with difficulty. Anyone looking at our parents' appearance could tell at a glance that we were in difficult circumstances. I hugged Mom's waist tightly. [Mom, don't worry. I'll make you rich within 10 years.] Director Kwak looked at me, held by Mom, and smiled broadly. \\"It might be strange to say this... but Seong-guk really seems to understand human speech. Anyway, that was my proposal today. How about seeing the broadcasting station's audition? However, under this broadcasting condition, no commercials for 6 months.\\" I quickly patted Dad's back. [Dad, this is it!] Dad looked down at me. \\"Seong-guk, do you want to do it?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I answered confidently. * * * Now, in front of me were the five members of the national idol group 'Just', who sang <Only You>, a song I used to enjoy before regression. Of course, they were just a bit beyond a rookie group at this point. These guys would become hugely successful in a few years and become a national idol group. [These are the guys who sang at my twelfth birthday...] I recalled that day. At the largest banquet hall of the Samjeon Hotel, not only 'Just' but also rising girl idol groups attended my twelfth birthday. Their first words were this. \\"Jeon Seong-guk, happy twelfth birthday!\\" Everyone tried to make eye contact with me... The members of 'Just' later encountered me a few times in private as adults. Like most idols, some became actors, some became entertainers for a living. Leader Taehyung approached me first. Some members of 'Just' used their real names, and some used English names. \\"You're the dad! That model. I saw that commercial too.\\" Leader and main rapper Taehyung, with his handsome face and despite being a pure Korean, spoke English well, acting as the brain of the team. I remember him later getting into the fashion business, saying he was going to do clothing. His personality wasn't too bad, and he was the type to look after his own interests well, so he married a woman who was a distant relative of a chaebol family and lived well. Then Lucas, who was exceptionally tall, approached. Lucas had a pure smile despite his size. A naive smile with a muscular body. He was somewhat the originator of the muscle idol, popular among women with his simple, college athlete style. \\"Wow, he's incredibly cute. Seong-guk will get more attention than us.\\" [Of course, that's obvious. Just wait and see!]"},{"prompt":"1.부러진 통나무는 50분에 520개 캘 수 있다 2.부러진 통나무를 세공 도구 (1회용 소모품)을 이용 하여 세공 할 수 있다 세공 도구의 가격은 4400 골드이다 3.세공 도구로 부러진 통나무를 세공 할 시 8% 확률로 3줄 통나무가 된다 4. 3줄 통나무는 1개당 경매장에서 150000 골드에 팔리며 이 때 수수료는 4%이다 5.10000000 골드당 7300원으로 환전 할 수 있다 6. 1시간당 총 얼마의 순수익이 생기는가?","completion":"순수익을 계산하기 위해 주어진 정보를 바탕으로 단계별로 수익을 계산해보겠습니다. 1. **통나무 캐기**: - 60분에 520개 캐므로, 50분에는 몇 개를 캘 수 있는가? - 520개는 60분에 해당하니, 1분에는 520 / 60 = 8.667개 - 따라서, 50분에는 8.667 * 50 = 433.35개, 반올림하면 433개의 부러진 통나무를 캘 수 있습니다. 2. **세공하기**: - 세공 도구 가격: 4400 골드 - 부러진 통나무 433개를 세공하는데 433 * 4400 = 1,905,200 골드가 든다. 3. **3줄 통나무의 수**: - 8% 확률로 3줄 통나무가 되므로, 433 * 0.08 = 34.64개 - 반올림을 고려, 약 35개의 3줄 통나무를 얻을 수 있습니다. 4. **경매장 판매**: - 3줄 통나무 1개당 150,000 골드, 35개 판매시 총 수입은 35 * 150,000 = 5,250,000 골드 - 수수료 4% 고려: 5,250,000 * 0.96 = 5,040,000 골드 5. **순수익 계산**: - 총 수입: 5,040,000 골드 - 세공비용: -1,905,200 골드 - 순수익: 5,040,000 - 1,905,200 = 3,134,800 골드 6. **환전**: - 10,000,000 골드당 7300원 - 순수익 3,134,800 골드를 환전하면, 단위 가격당 환전액을 바탕으로 계산: - 환전 비율: 7300원 / 10,000,000 골드 = 0.00073원 / 골드 - 따라서, 3,134,800 골드의 원화 환전액: 3,134,800 * 0.00073 = 2,288.404원 결론적으로, 1시간당 순수익은 대략 2,288.404원입니다. 계산과정에서 반올림을 했기 때문에 약간의 오차가 있을 수 있음을 참고해 주세요."},{"prompt":"найди мне источники по теме мелиорации не старше 5 лет","completion":"К сожалению, я не могу выполнить запрос на поиск источников, так как у меня нет доступа к интернету.

However, deploying these models has been challenging due to the astronomical amount of model parameters, which requires a demand for large memory capacity and high memory bandwidth. In this paper, we propose an effective approach that can make the deployment of LLMs more efficiently. We support an automatic INT4 weight-only quantization flow and design a special LLM runtime with highly-optimized kernels to accelerate the LLM inference on CPUs. We demonstrate the general applicability of our approach on popular LLMs including Llama2, Llama, GPT-NeoX, and showcase the extreme inference efficiency on CPUs. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-transformers. 1Introduction Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance and tremendous potential across a wide range of tasks Rozière et al. (2023); Touvron et al. (2023b, a); Zhang et al. (2022); Brown et al. (2020); Li et al. (2023). However, deploying these models has been challenging due to the astronomical amount of model parameters, which necessitates significant memory capacity and high memory bandwidth. Quantization is a technique to reduce the numeric precision of weights and activations of a neural network to lower the computation costs of inference. INT8 quantization Vanhoucke et al. (2011); Han et al. (2015); Jacob et al. (2018) is the most widely-used approach today given the trade-off between high inference performance and reasonable model accuracy. However, outliers in activations have been observed and those outlier values are limiting the general adoption of INT8 quantization, though there are some related work that has been proposed to address the issues Xiao et al. (2023); Wei et al. (2023); Dettmers et al. (2022). FP8 is a newly introduced data type that has attracted lots of attentions Micikevicius et al. (2022); Kuzmin et al. (2022); Sun et al. (2019); Shen et al. (2023) while it has little adoptions due to the hardware unavailability. On the other hand, weight-only quantization becomes popular as it applies the low precision (e.g., 4-bit) to weights only, while keeping higher precision (e.g., 16-bit floating point) for activations, therefore maintaining the model accuracy. There are many excellent work on 4-bit weight-only quantization Dettmers et al. (2023); Frantar et al. (2022); Cheng et al. (2023b); Lin et al. (2023); Kim et al. (2023); Wu et al. (2023); Cheng et al. (2023a) that have demonstrated the effectiveness in LLM inference. Meanwhile, the open-source community is embracing such low-bit weight-only quantization and offers the CPP-based implementations such as llama.cpp and starcoder.cpp based on ggml library. These implementations are typically optimized for CUDA and may not work on CPUs. Therefore, it is important to address the challenge of making LLM inference efficient on CPU. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for LLM inference on CPUs including an automatic INT4 quantization flow and an efficient LLM runtime. We leverage Intel Neural Compressor that provides the support of INT4 quantization such as GPTQ Frantar et al. (2022), AWQ Lin et al. (2023), TEQ Cheng et al. (2023a), SignRound Cheng et al. (2023b) and generate the INT4 model automatically. Inspired from the ggml library, we develop a tensor library for CPU, supporting all the mainstream instruction sets such as AVX2, AVX512, AVX512_VNNI Rodriguez et al. (2018), and AMX (Advanced Matrix Extensions). Our results show the average latency of generation tokens from 20ms to 80ms on LLMs with 6B to 20B parameters using just a single socket of 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors, while preserving the high accuracy within only 1% loss from FP32 baseline. Our main contributions are as follows: • We propose an automatic INT4 quantization flow and generate the high-quality INT4 models with negligible accuracy loss within <1% from FP32 baseline. • We design a tensor library that supports general CPU instruction sets and latest instruction sets for deep learning acceleration. With CPU tensor library, we develop an efficient LLM runtime to accelerate the inference. • We apply our inference solution to popular LLM models covering 3B to 20B and demonstrate the promising per-token generation latency from 20ms to 80ms, much faster than the average human reading speed about 200ms per token. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the approach including INT4 quantization and inference. Section 3 outlines the experimental setup, presents accuracy & performance results, and offers discussion on performance tuning. Section 4 presents the conclusions and future work. 2Approach In this section, we introduce the approach which consists of two major components: an automatic INT4 quantization flow and an efficient LLM runtime, as shown in Figure 1. More details are described in the following sections. Refer to caption Figure 1:The left part is the automatic INT4 quantization flow: given a FP32 model, the flow takes the default INT4 quantization recipes and evaluates the accuracy of INT4 model; the recipe tuning loop is optional, if INT4 model can meet the accuracy target. The right part is a simplified runtime for efficient LLM inference built on top of a CPU tensor library with automatic kernel selector. 2.1Automatic INT4 Quantization Flow INT4 quantization flow is developed based on Intel Neural Compressor, a popular quantization tool for deep learning frameworks. Since the tool has already supported the mainstream INT4 quantization recipes such as GPTQ, SignRound, AWQ, TEQ, and RTN (round-to-nearest), our automatic quantization flow allows the recipe tuning on different quantization recipes, different granularities (channel-wise or group-wise), different group size (32, 64, 128 … 1024). Each recipe generates an INT4 model that is evaluated in the flow. Once the INT4 model meets the accuracy target, the model will be passed to LLM Runtime for performance evaluation. 2.2Efficient LLM Runtime LLM runtime is designed to provide the efficient inference of LLMs on CPUs. Figure 2 describes the key components in LLM runtime, where the components (CPU tensor library and LLM optimizations) in green are specialized for LLM inference, while the other components (memory management, thread scheduler, operator optimization and fusion) in blue are required for a general runtime. More details about CPU tensor library and LLM optimizations are described in the following paragraphs, while the general components are omitted due to the space limitations. Note that the design is flexibly extensible with hardware abstraction layer (CPU only for now), while how to support other hardware is out of scope in this paper. Refer to caption Figure 2:Key components in LLM runtime: general and LLM specialized. CPU Tensor Library. We develop CPU tensor library for linear algebra subroutines, inspired from the template design of cutlass. The tensor library offers a comprehensive support of INT4 kernels for x86 CPUs as shown in Table 1, where AMX is available in the latest Intel Xeon Scalable Processors and VNNI is available in both Intel and AMD CPUs. Table 1:Support matrix by CPU tensor library: input/output data type, compute data type, and ISA (instruction set architecture). The library supports dynamic quantization for input along with batch or input channel per group, and weight quantization in both symmetric and asymmetric scheme. Input Data Type Output Data Type Compute Data Type Compute ISA FP32 FP32 FP32 AVX2 FP32 FP32 FP32 AVX512F FP32 FP32 INT8 AVX_VNNI FP32 FP32 INT8 AVX512_VNNI FP32 FP32 INT8 AMX_INT8 FP32/FP16 FP32/FP16 FP16 AVX512_FP16 FP32/BF16 FP32/BF16 BF16 AMX_BF16 LLM Optimizations. Most recent LLMs are typically decoder-only Transformer-based models Vaswani et al. (2017). Given the unique characteristics of next token generation, KV cache becomes performance critical for LLM inference. We describe the optimizations in Figure 3. Refer to caption (a) Refer to caption (b) Figure 3:KV cache optimization. Left (a) shows the default KV cache, where new token generation requires memory reallocation for all the tokens (5 in this example); right (b) shows the optimized KV cache with pre-allocated KV memory and only new token updated each time. 3Results 3.1Experimental Setup To demonstrate the generality, we select the popular LLMs across a wide range of architectures with the model parameter size from 7B to 20B. We evaluate the accuracy of both FP32 and INT4 models using open-source datasets from lm-evaluation-harness including lambada Paperno et al. (2016) openai, hellaswag Zellers et al. (2019), winogrande Sakaguchi et al. (2021), piqa Bisk et al. (2020), and wikitext. To demonstrate the performance, we measure the latency of next token generation on the 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors, available on the public clouds such as AWS. 3.2Accuracy We evaluate the accuracy on the aforementioned datasets and show the average accuracy in Table 2. We can see from the table that the accuracy of INT4 model is nearly on par with that of FP32 model within 1% relative loss from FP32 baseline. Table 2:INT4 and FP32 model accuracy. INT4 model has two configurations: group size=32 and 128.

Table 3 presents the latency under a proxy configuration with 32 as both input and output tokens. Note that ggml-based solution only supports group size 32 when testing. Table 3:INT4 performance using LLM runtime and ggml-based solution. LLM runtime outperforms ggml-based solution by up to 1.6x under group-size=128 and 1.3x under group size=32. model LLM Runtime (Group size=32) LLM Runtime (Group size=128) ggml-based (Group size=32) EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B 22.99ms 19.98ms 31.62ms meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf 23.4ms 21.96ms 27.71ms decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf 23.88ms 22.04ms 27.2ms EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b 80.16ms 61.21ms 92.36ms tiiuae/falcon-7b 31.23ms 22.26ms 36.22ms 3.4Discussion Though we demonstrate the performance advantage over ggml-based solution, there are still opportunities for LLM runtime to further improve the performance through additional performance tuning such as thread scheduler in LLM runtime, blocking strategy in CPU tensor library. 4Summary and Future Work We presented an end-to-end INT4 LLM inference including an automatic INT4 model quantization and efficient LLM runtime. We demonstrated the generality on a set of popular LLMs and the performance advantage over the open-source solution on CPUs. As our future works, we plan to further improve the CPU tensor library and extend Hugging Face transformer APIs to support INT4 LLM inference as part of the contributions to the open-source community. Moreover, we plan to exercise our approach on personal computers (PCs) given the broad accessibility of CPUs, to meet the growing demands of AI generated content and empower generative AI on PCs. 4.1Appendix Memory usage is a critical metric for the 4-bit solution.

Let's break it down piece by piece for easier understanding: 1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: These are advanced AI algorithms designed to understand, generate, and work with human language. They've become incredibly powerful and useful for a wide range of tasks, like writing text similar to how a human would or answering questions. However, they're usually huge, containing billions of parameters (tiny bits of data that guide their decisions), making them resource-intensive to run, especially in terms of memory and the ability to process instructions rapidly. 2. **Deployment Challenges**: Because these models are so large and need lots of memory and fast processing, it's been difficult to use them efficiently, especially on regular CPUs found in most computers, as opposed to specialized hardware designed for high-speed computations. 3. **The Solution - Quantization and Optimization**: The paper proposes a solution to this by doing two main things: a. **Quantization**: This is a technique that reduces the complexity of the model without losing much accuracy. Imagine if you had to save space by summarizing a detailed picture into fewer colors. If done well, the picture still looks good, but it's much smaller in size. Specifically, they use a method called INT4 quantization, which simplifies the data inside the model to make it run faster and require less memory. b. **Optimization on CPUs**: They've created a special system that makes these simplified models run very efficiently on regular CPUs, ensuring that even complex language tasks can be done quickly and accurately without needing specialized hardware. 4. **Results**: They tested this approach on several well-known language models and showed that it works very well, making these models much faster and only slightly less accurate than the full, uncomplicated versions. This means tasks that involve generating text can be done nearly in real-time on ordinary computers. 5. **Future Plans**: They intend to further improve this system and make it available for more developers to use, hoping to enable more applications of these powerful AI models on regular computers, making the technology more accessible and versatile. In simpler terms, this research paper is about making super-smart AI language helpers run smoothly on the computers most of us have, making it easier and cheaper to use them for cool tasks like writing articles, programming, and much more."},{"prompt":"Expand on point 'b'. What is the special system called?","completion":"The special system mentioned in point 'b' is referred to as an \\"efficient LLM (Large Language Model) runtime\\" in the document. This runtime is designed specifically to optimize the performance of LLMs on CPUs (Central Processing Units), which are the general-purpose processors found in most computers and servers. The efficient LLM runtime incorporates several key components to boost the efficiency of running large language models on CPUs: 1. **Automatic INT4 Quantization Flow**: This component automatically simplifies the model's data (quantizes it) to INT4 format. INT4 stands for 4-bit integers, a way of representing model parameters that require less memory and computational power than the more common 32-bit floating-point representation (FP32) or even the 8-bit integer (INT8) quantization often used for model compression. Despite using simpler numerical representations, the goal is to maintain the model's performance and accuracy as much as possible. 2. **CPU Tensor Library**: A collection of software that supports the operations needed by LLMs optimized for CPUs. This includes support for various instruction sets that modern CPUs can use, like AVX2, AVX512, and others specific to deep learning tasks. Instruction sets are essentially commands supported by CPUs that enable them to perform specific types of calculations more efficiently. The tensor library makes sure that the simplified (quantized) models can still run fast by leveraging these instruction sets. 3. **LLM Optimizations**: These are specific techniques and adjustments made to ensure that the language models can perform their tasks (like generating text) in a highly efficient manner on CPUs. For example, they mention an optimization related to KV cache, which is important for generating new text based on what the model has already processed. The LLM runtime builds on top of these components to offer a system that can take large, complex models that would typically be slow and cumbersome to run on general-purpose CPUs, and run them efficiently, making tasks like text generation, language understanding, and more accessible and cost-effective. This opens up the use of such models to a wider audience and allows for their deployment in a broader range of applications and devices."},{"prompt":"ok, i visited their github repo.

These techniques are used to reduce the size of the models and the computational resources they require, making it possible to run advanced AI models on devices like your laptop, which may not have the same resources as dedicated AI servers. 3. **Wide Range of Hardware Support**: Though it's optimized for Intel hardware (like your Core i7), INC also has support for other hardware platforms, including AMD CPU, ARM CPU, and Nvidia GPU through limited testing. This broad support ensures that you can use the library for model compression across different devices and CPUs efficiently. 4. **Zero-Code Optimization**: INC includes Neural Coder for zero-code optimization, making it easy for non-experts to optimize their models without diving deeply into the code. 5. **Automated and Customizable**: It provides both automated quantization strategies (for those who prefer simplicity) and advanced customization options (for experts who need more control over the compression process). # How It Relates to Running AI Models on Your i7 Laptop: If you’re interested in AI and have models you’d like to run or develop, using the Intel Neural Compressor can make it feasible to work on these projects directly on your laptop. Essentially, it can: - **Speed up AI Model Inference**: Make AI models run faster, allowing you to experiment and iterate more quickly. - **Reduce Model Size**: Make AI models smaller, so they take up less storage space on your laptop and require less memory to run. - **Enable Complex Models to Run on CPUs**: Allow more sophisticated AI models to run efficiently on regular CPUs like your 11th Gen Intel Core i7, without needing specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs. # Practical Example: Imagine you have developed a language model or want to use a pre-existing one (like GPT or BERT) for a project. Running these models in their original, uncompressed form might be slow or even infeasible on a regular laptop due to their size and the computational resources they require. By using Intel Neural Compressor, you can compress these models in such a way that they become lighter and faster, making it possible to deploy and use them effectively on your device. # Conclusion: The Intel® Neural Compressor stands as a powerful tool, especially for developers and AI enthusiasts with access to conventional hardware, like your Intel Core i7 laptop. It bridges the gap between the capabilities of general-purpose computing devices and the demanding requirements of running state-of-the-art AI models, making AI development more accessible and efficient."},{"prompt":"i cloned their github repo but i got this message: \\"\\"C:Usersbower>git clone https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.git Cloning into 'neural-compressor'... remote: Enumerating objects: 532396, done. remote: Counting objects: 100% (127792/127792), done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (18715/18715), done. remote: Total 532396 (delta 67527), reused 121379 (delta 61618), pack-reused 404604 Receiving objects: 100% (532396/532396), 379.11 MiB | 10.32 MiB/s, done.

Here's how you can resolve this issue: 1. **Enable Long Paths in Windows** (if using Windows 10 version 1607 or later): - Search for \\"Edit group policy\\" in the Start menu and open it. - Navigate to \`Local Computer Policy\` -> \`Computer Configuration\` -> \`Administrative Templates\` -> \`System\` -> \`Filesystem\`. - Find the \\"Enable NTFS long paths\\" setting and set it to \\"Enabled\\". 2. **Configure Git to Allow Long Paths**: - Open the Command Prompt or Git Bash and run the following command: \`\`\` git config --system core.longpaths true \`\`\` - This command informs Git to allow it to operate with longer paths than the default configuration. After applying these adjustments, try cloning the repository again. # Difference Between Cloning a Repo and Pip Installing a Library: **Cloning a Repo** refers to copying the entire repository (repo) from GitHub (or another version control system) to your local machine. This process gives you all the files, the complete history of changes, branches, and tags. Cloning is typically done if you want to inspect the code, modify it, or contribute to the project. The command you used, \`git clone\`, is how you clone a repo. - **Pros**: - Access to all files, including documentation, examples, source code, and tests. - Ability to modify the source code and contribute back to the original project. - **Cons**: - Requires manual setup and configuration to use the library in your projects. - You need to build or install the library from the source if it’s not in Python’s simple script or module form. **Pip Installing a Library** is about using Python’s package manager, \`pip\`, to install a library directly from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other indexes. When you \`pip install\`, you are downloading and installing the \\"packaged\\" version of the library which is ready to be used in your projects without needing to compile or configure anything manually. - **Pros**: - Quick and easy installation of libraries and tools directly into your Python environment. - Automatically manages dependencies. - **Cons**: - You only get the library’s compiled version and not the full repository. This means you typically don’t get the tests, examples, or documentation files. - Less control over modifications. You can’t change the source code directly if needed. In summary, cloning is about getting a complete copy of a project’s repository for inspection, modification, or contribution. \`Pip install\` is concerned with the convenient installation of a library for immediate use in your projects."},{"prompt":"ok, thanks. now, i got this message: \\"\\"C:Usersbower>git config --system core.longpaths true C:Usersbower>git clone https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.git fatal: destination path 'neural-compressor' already exists and is not an empty directory.

This situation arises because when you attempted to clone the repo earlier, Git successfully fetched the objects and created the directory structure but failed during the checkout process due to the long filename issue. Since the directory already exists from your previous attempt, Git refuses to overwrite it with a new clone. Here are the steps you can take to resolve this issue: 1. **Remove the Existing Directory**: If you don't need anything in the existing \`neural-compressor\` directory, you can delete it. Use this command: \`\`\`bash rmdir /S /Q \\"neural-compressor\\" \`\`\` This command will forcefully remove the directory and all its contents. Be cautious and ensure that you really want to delete it, as this action is irreversible. 2. **Clone Again**: After successfully deleting the existing directory, you can attempt to clone the repository again: \`\`\`bash git clone https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.git \`\`\` This command should now work without the \\"already exists\\" error, assuming you've previously set \`git config --system core.longpaths true\` and, if necessary, enabled long paths support in Windows as mentioned in my earlier response. 3. **Alternative - Use Another Folder Name**: If you prefer not to delete the existing \`neural-compressor\` folder (maybe you have some unchecked changes or wish to compare things), you can clone the repository into a new directory by specifying a new destination path: \`\`\`bash git clone https://github.com/intel/neural-compressor.git new-neural-compressor \`\`\` This command will clone the repository into a new folder called \`new-neural-compressor\` in your current working directory. Remember, if you've made local changes or have reasons to keep the original directory, consider backing up important files or using the alternative approach to clone into a new directory."},{"prompt":"\\"\\"C:Usersbower>rmdir /S /Q “neural-compressor” The system cannot find the file specified.

In Windows Command Prompt, it's crucial to use straight quotes or no quotes at all for commands and paths. Additionally, ensuring the exact name and path of the directory you wish to delete is critical. Try running the command again without quotes or with straight quotes if the directory name includes spaces: Without quotes (if the name doesn't contain spaces): \`\`\`cmd rmdir /S /Q neural-compressor \`\`\` With straight quotes (if the name contains spaces or as a general practice): \`\`\`cmd rmdir /S /Q \\"neural-compressor\\" \`\`\` If you're unsure about the directory's presence or name, you can list the contents of your current directory using: \`\`\`cmd dir \`\`\` This command will show all files and directories in your current working directory (\`C:Usersbower>\` in your case). Confirm the exact name of the directory you intend to remove, and ensure you're operating in the correct path. If the directory \`neural-compressor\` indeed exists but the removal command isn't working, double-check for typos. If the directory doesn't exist (perhaps it was already removed or never created due to the previous cloning error), then there's no need to run the removal command, and you can proceed with your next intended action, such as cloning the repository again or other tasks."},{"prompt":"Blooming Wall DPYC16 Spring Pink Flowers with Butterfly Textured Peel and Stick Wallpaper Self-Adhesive Prepasted Wallpaper Wall Décor, create a title with the prefix 'best', one liner, only strings, less than 100 characters only","completion":"Best Spring-Inspired Peel and Stick Wallpaper for Easy Room Refreshment"},{"prompt":"1.부러진 통나무는 45분에 520개 캘 수 있다 2.부러진 통나무를 세공 도구 (1회용 소모품)을 이용 하여 세공 할 수 있다 세공 도구의 가격은 4400 골드이다 3.세공 도구로 부러진 통나무를 세공 할 시 8% 확률로 3줄 통나무가 된다 4. 3줄 통나무는 1개당 경매장에서 150000 골드에 팔리며 이 때 수수료는 4%이다 5.10000000 골드당 7300원으로 환전 할 수 있다 6. 1시간 작업 한다고 했을 때 총 얼마의 순수익이 생기는가?","completion":"1시간 동안 부러진 통나무 캐기: - 1시간 동안 캘 수 있는 통나무 수: (frac{60}{45} times 520 = 693.33)개 (약 693개) 세공 도구 사용: - 세공 도구 가격: 4400 골드 - 693개의 통나무를 세공하는 데 필요한 세공 도구 비용: (693 times 4400 = 3,049,200) 골드 3줄 통나무 생성: - 생성 확률: 8% - 693개 중 3줄 통나무로 변하는 수: (693 times 0.08 = 55.44)개 (약 55개) 3줄 통나무 판매: - 3줄 통나무 1개당 가격: 150,000 골드 - 55개 판매 시 총 판매액: (55 times 150,000 = 8,250,000) 골드 - 판매 수수료: (8,250,000 times 0.04 = 330,000) 골드 총 순수익 계산: - 순 판매액: (8,250,000 - 330,000 = 7,920,000) 골드 - 총 순수익(세공 도구 비용 제외): (7,920,000 - 3,049,200 = 4,870,800) 골드 환전: - 환전 비율: 10000000 골드당 7300원 - 순수익 환전 금액: (frac{4,870,800}{10,000,000} times 7300 = 355.57)원 따라서, 1시간 작업으로 얻는 순수익은 약 355.57원입니다. 참고: 위의 계산은 부러진 통나무의 총 개수를 정수로 반올림하여 계산하였습니다. 실제 환경에서는 정확한 수치가 다를 수 있으므로 계산 시 주의가 필요합니다."},{"prompt":"3555.7원이라는 말이니?","completion":"계산 과정 중 환전 금액 계산 시 실수가 있었습니다. 정정해서 다시 계산해 보겠습니다. 초기 순수익은 4,870,800 골드입니다. 환전 비율에 따르면, 10,000,000 골드는 7300원이므로, [4,870,800 text{ 골드} times frac{7300원}{10,000,000 text{ 골드}} = 4,870,800 times 0.00073 = 3,555.7 text{ 원}] 정정하였습니다. 따라서 1시간 작업으로 얻는 순수익은 약 3,555.7원입니다. 실수를 지적해주셔서 감사합니다."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"coffee in shop with flower\\"","completion":"coffee in shop with flower"},{"prompt":"Best Spring-Inspired Peel and Stick Wallpaper for Easy Room Refreshment, generate a personal experience with this, add hash tag at the bottom, less than 700 characters only, only strings, no </br> html","completion":"Just transformed my study with this gorgeous Spring Bloom Peel and Stick Wallpaper from EasyPeel Décor!

[이제 마지막 한 명이 남았는데….] “왓썹. 난 마이클이야. 잘 부탁해.” 건들건들한 포즈에 느끼한 면상. 거기다 이름도 버터 냄새 나는 마이클. 재미교포 출신인 이 녀석은 나중에 사고란 사고는 다 치고 다닌다. 여자와 돈 문제까지 얽히고 얽혀서 나름 국민 아이돌이란 칭호를 얻은 ‘저스트’의 얼굴에 먹칠하는 멤버이다. 마이클이 손으로 내 뺨을 슬쩍 건드렸다. 손가락에서 담배 냄새가 났다. [이 자식이 감히 담배 피운 손으로 날 건드려?!] 내가 미간을 찌푸리자 마이클이 어이없단 얼굴로 나를 봤다. “뭐야, 얘 나 싫어하나 봐.” 마이클은 혀 꼬부라진 말투로 나를 자극했다. 나는 고개를 휙 돌렸다. “너 담배 피우고 왔지? 나도 싫은데, 애는 좋겠니?” 리더인 태형이 핀잔을 주자, 마이클은 영어로 중얼거리며 구석에 찌그러졌다. 나는 다시 평온한 얼굴로 이들을 바라봤다. 엄마는 볼록 나온 배를 만지며 신기한 얼굴로 ‘저스트’를 보느라 정신없었다. 특히 잘생긴 범선을 넋 놓고 바라봤다. [엄마, 정신 차려!] 내가 잡아당기자 엄마는 얼른 정신을 차리고 나를 안았다. “성국아, 오빠들 진짜 잘생겼어.” [엄마보다도 어린 애도 있어.] 속내와 다르게 나는 고개를 끄덕이곤 비즈니스 대답을 해줬다. “응!” 이제 돌도 지나서 어색하지만 걷기도 시작했고, 옹알이를 벗어난 수준의 단어도 가끔 내뱉을 수 있게 혀가 돌아갔다. [엄마, 저 얼굴에 속으면 안 돼. 얼굴에 분칠하는 것들 말은 믿으면 안 된다는 말도 있잖아.] 엄마는 내 속도 모르고 저스트를 보며 싱글벙글 웃기만 했다. 감독이 들어오자 저스트가 일렬로 서서 동시에 꾸벅 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요! 대한민국 가요계를 이끌어갈 저스트입니다!” “반가워. 다들 이야기는 들었지?” “네.” 태형이 대표로 대답했다. “너희 숙소에서 3일 정도 촬영할 건데. 성국이는 아침 9시에 나와서 6시까지 촬영하고, 하루만 숙소에서 잘 거야. 그냥 생활 예능이니까, 최대한 자연스럽게. 나중에 편집으로 우리가 캐릭터는 다 만들어줄게.” “감사합니다! 감독님!” “숙소에서는 그렇게 각 잡지들 마. 옷들도 원래 입던 것들 입고. 메이크업도 최대한 하지 말고.” “네!” 감독은 이제 내게 눈길을 줬다. “성국이 칭찬은 곽 감독한테 많이 들었어요. 말귀를 그렇게 잘 알아듣는다면서요?” “저희도 깜짝깜짝 놀랄 때가 있어요.” “참, 주의 사항 아시죠?” “방송 시작하고 6개월 동안은 광고 금지요?” “네. 파일럿 날려보고 안 되면 금방 접을 수도 있어요. 이렇게라도 방송 타면 나중에 광고 모델 하는 건 더 유리할 거예요.” 엄마는 감독의 이야기를 귀 기울여 들었다. 감독은 우선 3일 정도 촬영한 것을 바탕으로 파일럿 프로그램을 만들어서 내보낸 후에 정규 편성 논의를 할 거라고 했다. “근데 어머니, 만삭이시네요.” “다음 달이 출산 예정일이에요.” “얼른 찍어야겠네요. 근데 반응 좋으면 정규 들어갈 텐데, 어머니가 안 오면 성국이 불안해하고 그러지 않나요?” “저도 그게 걱정인데요…. 성국이는 낯은 안 가려요.” [엄마, 나 완전 프로야. 걱정이란 것은 하지도 마.] 감독이 내 볼을 귀엽다는 듯이 잡아당겼다. “이 자식, 진짜 말귀 알아듣는 얼굴이네요. 완전 걱정 말란 얼굴이잖아요. 우선 촬영해보죠. 파일럿이 잘돼야 다음도 있는 거니까요.” “잘 부탁드립니다, 감독님.” 엄마는 부른 배를 안고 고개 숙여 인사했다. 나도 엄마를 따라 배꼽에 두 손을 딱 모으고 인사했다. [앞으로 잘 부탁해, 감독. 이 은혜는 내가 성공하면 몇 배로 갚을 테니 걱정 마.] * * * 드디어 첫 촬영이 시작됐다. 내가 할 일은 말갛게 씻은 얼굴로 촬영장으로 향하는 것뿐이었다. 나는 이미 이 프로그램의 끝까지 모두 알고 있었다. 동글동글 귀여운 눈으로 잘 웃고, 잘 울면 멤버들 역시 나를 이해하고 같이 웃고 울고 하는 거였다. 나와 엄마는 방송국에서 보내준 차를 타고 촬영 장소인 ‘저스트’의 숙소로 향했다. 반지하 숙소 인근은 이미 스태프와 각종 촬영 장비도 가득했다. 엄마가 나를 안고 내리자 조연출이 다가와서 얼른 내 상태를 확인했다. “성국이 컨디션 괜찮죠?” “잠도 잘 자고, 아침도 먹였어요.” “좋네요. 그럼 30분 후에 촬영 들어가겠습니다. 조금만 대기해 주세요.” “네.” 엄마와 나는 다시 차 안에서 30분을 기다렸다. 대기 시간 동안 엄마는 가져온 책을 읽어줬다. <왕자와 거지>였다. 똑같은 얼굴을 한 왕자와 거지가 서로의 일상을 바꿔 살아본다는 내용의 동화이다. [이거 내 이야기잖아.] 재벌이었을 때, 이 이야기를 읽으면서 그런 생각을 했다. 절대 단 하루라도 누군가와 인생을 바꿀 생각 따위는 하지 말아라. 왜냐하면 재벌의 삶이란 모두가 부러워하는 삶이기 때문이다. 나는 생각에 잠겨 고개를 끄덕였다. “성국아, 그림만 봐도 재미있어?” 나는 대충 고개를 끄덕였다. 저들은 아마 내가 어떤 생각과 경험을 가진 사람인지 아무도 모를 것이다. 한때는 삼전 그룹의 후계자였던 전성국이었다. 그 모든 왕좌의 짐을 내려놓은 게 지금의 전성국이었다. 똑. 똑. 차 문을 두드리는 소리가 들렸다. 엄마가 창을 내리자 조연출이 배시시 웃으며 나를 쳐다봤다. “촬영 곧 들어갈게요.” “녜에!” 나는 번쩍 손을 들었다. * * * 카메라가 돌아갔다. 나와 ‘저스트’ 주변을 에워싼 수십 명의 스태프들이 숨죽였다. ‘저스트’의 멤버들은 이미 대강 라인이 정해진 각본에 따라 각자 편안한 차림으로 거실에 모였다. ‘저스트’의 숙소였다. ‘저스트’의 숙소는 소속사와 가까운 30평대의 오래된 반지하 빌라였다. 아직 인기가 그렇게 많은 그룹은 아니어서 아파트나 주상복합으로 옮기지는 못한 모양이었다. 하지만 이게 더 정감 가고, 괜찮은 그림이 나올 것 같았다. 이른 아침, 띵동 초인종 소리가 들리고 막 잠에서 깬 멤버들이 나오면 문이 열리면서 아기 바구니에 든 내가 배달되는 장면부터 찍었다. 프로의 이름은 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’였다. 그 콘셉트에 충실한 오프닝이었다. 막 잠에서 깬 리더 태형이 아기 바구니를 들고 당황하며 멤버들을 불러 모았다. “얘들아, 이리 모여봐.” 멤버들은 그제야 상황을 파악하고 2박 3일 동안 함께할 나를 맞으러 모두 졸린 눈으로 나왔다. [연기들 좀 하는데?] 몇은 자연스레 머리도 헝클고 눈에 안 띄게 메이크업도 했다. 나는 잔뜩 겁에 질린 얼굴로 ‘저스트’ 멤버들을 한 명씩 눈으로 훑었다. [자, 이제 첫 장면이다. 낯선 곳에 왔으니 울어볼까?] 이게 내가 생각한 첫 장면이었다. 긴장감에 울음을 터트린 아기. 그 아기를 달래기 위해 최선을 다하는 ‘저스트’ 멤버! [음. 흠.] 나는 목을 풀고는 혼신을 다해서 울어재꼈다. “엄마앙! 아빠앙!” 나를 잽싸게 안아 든 것은 마이클이었다. [눈치 빠른 녀석.] 보나 마나 분량을 챙기려는 수작이다. 하지만 이 정도로 울음을 그치면 분량이 충분하지 않을 것 같은데…. 어쩔 수 없군. 나는 더 목 놓아 울어재꼈다. 곧바로 꽃미남 재현이 나를 빼앗듯이 안아 들었다. 나는 타이밍에 맞게 재현을 보고는 울음을 차츰 멈췄다. “애도 이쁜 사람 좋아하네.” 멤버들의 반응에 이번엔 덩치만 근육돌 루카스가 나를 안으려고 들었다. “성국아, 이리 와봐. 형이야, 형.” 낯선 장소에서 당황하는 모습. 마이클이 안아 들자 우는 장면에 이어 재현이 나를 안자 잠잠해지는 것까지는 계산된 상황이었다. 갑자기 루카스는 좀 당황스러웠다. [이 녀석과의 관계 설정을 어찌하지?] 순간, 루카스의 두툼한 손바닥이 눈앞에 보였다. 나는 얼른 루카스의 손바닥을 내 작은 손으로 콩 찍었다. 마치 놀이를 하듯이. “성국이도 루카스가 장난 좋아하는 거 단번에 알아보네. 루카스랑 놀려고 하나 봐.” 태형의 예상대로 나는 루카스를 친구로 설정했다. 듬직한 리더 태형은 아빠. 자상한 꽃미남 재현은 엄마. 근육돌 루카스는 친구. 낯가림이 있는 범선과는 어색한 사이. 장난치기 좋아하는 마이클과는 앙숙. 나는 얼른 머리로 관계 설정을 끝마쳤다. 그러곤 방긋 웃었다. [앞으로 잘 부탁해, ‘저스트’.] ‘저스트’ 멤버들이 모두 내 앞으로 모여들었다. “성국아, 앞으로 잘 지내보자.” 리더인 태형이 이야기하자 모두들 나를 향해 손을 흔들었다. 나는 조금 경계를 풀고는 어색하게 미소를 지었다. 낯설지만, 진심으로 나를 대하는 ‘저스트’와의 첫 만남 엔딩으로 이것만큼 좋은 것은 없어 보였다. “컷! 자, 다음 갑시다!” 감독의 만족스러운 목소리가 들렸다. * * * 쉬는 시간이 시작됐다. 이제 제법 배가 부른 엄마 옆에서 나는 ‘저스트’ 다섯 멤버들 분석을 시작한다. 집중하기 위해서 엄마의 뱃살에 얼굴을 콕 박았다. [엄마 냄새 조아. 헤헤.] “성국아, 엄마가 그렇게 좋아?” “녜에!” 나는 격하게 호응했다. 엄마는 환하게 웃으며 내 볼에 마구 뽀뽀를 해댔다. [엄마, 나도 이제 내일모레면 18개월이라고. 거기다 이제 동생도 생기는데 창피하게 왜 이래.] 내가 발버둥을 치자, 엄마는 나를 더 꼭 안았다. ‘저스트’의 맏형 태형이 달려오더니 간식과 물을 내밀었다. “어머니 피곤하지죠?” “아니에요.” “근데 어머니, 진짜 젊으세요.” [태형아, 너랑 동갑이야.] “그럼 어머니, 쉬시고 뭐 필요한 거 있으면 언제든 편하게 말씀하세요.” “감사해요. 정말로요.” 엄마는 배시시 웃으며 뒤돌아가는 태형의 뒷모습에서 눈을 떼지 못했다. [엄마, 대체 왜 그래? 혹 쟤들 잘생겨서 그러는 거야? 어?] 엄마는 태형이 건넨 간식을 먹으며 연신 미소를 지었다. “성국아, 저스트 멤버들 다 너무 잘생겼어.” [엄마, 내가 아빠한테 다 이를 거야!] “성국아, 이건 아빠한테 비밀!” 엄마가 내 입에 입을 쪽 맞췄다. [이러면 마음 약해지는데….] “자, 이제 촬영 다시 시작합니다!” 조연출의 목소리가 들렸다. 엄마는 나를 안고 촬영장으로 향했다. 나는 두 손을 쫙 펴서 머리를 뒤로 넘기고, 내복을 탁탁 털었다. [자. 촬영 시작해볼까.] * * * 엄마와 함께하는 낮 촬영은 대부분 순조롭게 진행됐다. 엄마가 카메라 뒤에 어딘가에 있었고, 나는 카메라를 의식하지 않은 채 자유롭게 행동하기만 해도 다들 귀엽다고 난리였다. 그리고 내가 밤을 꼬박 ‘저스트’ 멤버들과 함께 보내야 하는 마지막 날 밤의 촬영이 다가왔다. 엄마는 임산부였기 때문에 아빠와 함께 근처 작은 호텔에서 잠을 자기로 했다. 혹시라도 있을 사건 사고에 대비하기 위해서 연출팀 몇 명이서 돌아가는 카메라를 주시했다. 그래도 안심이 안 되는지, 아빠는 임산부인 엄마만 호텔에 데려다주고 촬영팀과 함께 밤새 숨을 죽이고 카메라를 관찰했다. 감독도 떠나면서 나에게 딱 하나만 당부했다. “성국아, 그냥 잘 자고 잘 먹고 잘 싸면 돼.” [걱정 마, 감독. 내가 안 하려고 해도 이 나이엔 그게 조절이 안 돼.] 감독은 ‘저스트’ 멤버들에게도 단단히 주의를 줬다. “성국이는 18개월밖에 안 된 아기야. 다들 알지?” “네!” “진짜 조심해야 해.” “감독님, 걱정 마세요. 제가 있잖아요.” 마이클이 넉살 좋게 다가갔다. “그래, 너만 믿는다.” 세상에서 단 한 명을 믿지 말라면 그건 바로 마이클이었다. 곧 촬영팀이 나가는 장면을 촬영하고는, 관찰 카메라 두 대만이 구석에서 돌아갔다. “성국이 저녁 누가 준비할래?” 태형이 멤버들에게 물었다. 그러자 마이클이 얼른 나섰다. “내가 할게!” “네가?” 멤버들은 모두 의아한 얼굴로 마이클을 쳐다봤다. “진짜 네가 한다고?” 재현의 얼굴만 봐도 마이클 이 녀석, 분량 챙기려는 욕심이 분명하다.","completion":"Episode 10 \\"Your smile is seriously beautiful. I'm Jaehyun. Seongguk-ah, please take care of me.\\" Jaehyun approached with a smile in his eyes. Jaehyun was very popular for his handsome looks, but later he became the subject of gossip several times due to complicated issues with women. \\"Hi, I'm Beomseon. Call me hyung. Or is it hyungnim? That sounds a bit like a gangster, doesn't it?\\" [Hey, Beomseon! Long time no see.] Beomseon and I had quite a connection. Beomseon was known as the actor among idols and later successfully transitioned into an actor with macho charm. I remember drinking for a long time at the after-party of a film festival sponsored by Samjeon Group, where he won the Best Actor award. He had good manners when drinking and, above all, he was loyal. It was a film festival sponsored by Samjeon Group, so I even went to the after-party, which I normally wouldn't have. [Now, only one person is left...] \\"What's up. I'm Michael. Nice to meet you.\\" A greasy face with a swaggering pose. And the name Michael even smells like butter. This guy, of Korean-American descent, later gets into all sorts of trouble, from issues with women to money. He was a member who tarnished the image of 'Just', a national idol group, with his involvement in various scandals. Michael lightly touched my cheek with his hand. His fingers smelled of cigarettes. [This guy dares to touch me with his cigarette-smelling hand?!] When I frowned, Michael looked at me with a face that couldn't believe it. \\"What, does he hate me?\\" Michael provoked me with his twisted tongue. I turned my head away. \\"You smoked before coming here, right? I don't like it, but would the kid like it?\\" When the leader, Taehyung, scolded him, Michael mumbled in English and slumped into a corner. I looked back at them with a calm face. My mom was busy watching 'Just' with a fascinated face, especially staring at the handsome Beomseon, her belly bulging out. [Mom, get a grip!] When I pulled her, mom quickly came to her senses and hugged me. \\"Seongguk-ah, the oppas are really handsome.\\" [There are even kids younger than mom.] Despite my inner thoughts, I nodded and gave a business-like response. \\"Yes!\\" Now that I was past a year old, it was awkward, but I started walking and could occasionally utter words beyond babbling. [Mom, you shouldn't be fooled by those faces. There's also a saying that you shouldn't trust people who put makeup on their faces.] Mom just smiled happily at 'Just', unaware of my thoughts. When the director entered, 'Just' stood in a line and bowed at the same time. \\"Hello! We are 'Just', leading the Korean music industry!\\" \\"Nice to meet you. You've all heard the story, right?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Taehyung answered as the representative. \\"We'll be filming at your dorm for about 3 days. Seongguk will come out at 9 AM and film until 6 PM, and he'll stay at the dorm for just one day. Since it's a reality show, act as naturally as possible. We'll create the characters through editing later.\\" \\"Thank you, Director!\\" \\"Don't be too stiff at the dorm. Wear your usual clothes. Try to wear minimal makeup.\\" \\"Yes!\\" The director then turned his attention to me. \\"I've heard a lot of praise about Seongguk from Director Kwak. They say he understands everything so well?\\" \\"We're also surprised sometimes.\\" \\"Remember the precautions, right?\\" \\"No commercials for 6 months after the broadcast starts?\\" \\"Yes. If the pilot doesn't work out, we might cancel it quickly. But if you get on the show, it'll be more advantageous for you to become a commercial model later.\\" Mom listened carefully to the director's words. The director said he would create a pilot program based on the filming for about 3 days and then discuss regular programming. \\"But, mother, you're in your last month of pregnancy.\\" \\"My due date is next month.\\" \\"We need to film quickly. But if the response is good and we go regular, won't Seongguk be anxious without his mother?\\" \\"That's what I'm worried about... Seongguk doesn't shy away from strangers.\\" [Mom, I'm a total pro. Don't even worry.] The director pinched my cheek as if he found me cute. \\"This kid really looks like he understands everything. He has a face that says don't worry. Let's start filming. We'll see about the next steps if the pilot does well.\\" \\"Thank you, Director.\\" Mom bowed with her bulging belly and I mimicked her, placing my hands neatly on my belly button. [Please take care of me, Director. I'll repay this kindness several times over when I succeed, so don't worry.] * * * Finally, the first filming started. All I had to do was head to the filming site with a freshly washed face. I already knew everything about this program from start to finish. With my round, cute eyes, smiling and crying well, the members would understand me and laugh and cry together. Mom and I took the car sent by the broadcasting station and headed to 'Just's dorm, the filming location. The area around the semi-basement dorm was already full of staff and various filming equipment. When mom got out of the car holding me, the assistant director quickly came over to check on me. \\"Is Seongguk's condition okay?\\" \\"He slept well and had breakfast.\\" \\"Good. Then we'll start filming in 30 minutes. Please wait a bit.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Mom and I waited in the car for 30 minutes. During the waiting time, mom read me a book. It was \\"The Prince and the Pauper.\\" A fairy tale about a prince and a pauper with identical faces swapping their lives. [This is my story.] When I was a chaebol, I thought while reading this story. Never even think of swapping lives with someone for a single day. Because the life of a chaebol is a life everyone envies. I nodded off, lost in thought. \\"Seongguk-ah, is it fun just looking at the pictures?\\" I casually nodded. They probably don't know what kind of thoughts and experiences I have. I was once Jeon Seongguk, the heir to Samjeon Group. And now, I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, who has laid down all the burdens of that throne. Knock. Knock. The sound of knocking on the car door was heard. When mom rolled down the window, the assistant director smiled broadly and looked at me. \\"We're about to start filming.\\" \\"Yeees!\\" I raised my hand high. * * * The camera started rolling. Dozens of staff members surrounding me and 'Just' held their breath. The members of 'Just' had already gathered in the living room in comfortable attire according to the roughly set script. It was 'Just's dorm. The dorm of 'Just' was an old semi-basement villa of about 30 pyeong, close to the agency. Since they weren't that popular yet, they hadn't moved to an apartment or a mixed-use complex. But this seemed more intimate and seemed like it would produce a better picture. Early in the morning, the sound of the doorbell rang, and as the members who had just woken up came out, the door opened, and I was delivered in a baby basket. The name of the show was 'Five Men and a Baby Basket.' It was a faithful opening to the concept. The leader, Taehyung, who had just woken up, picked up the baby basket and gathered the members in confusion. \\"Guys, come here.\\" The members finally grasped the situation and all came out with sleepy eyes to welcome me, who would be with them for 2 nights and 3 days. [Are they acting?] Some naturally had their hair messed up and subtly applied makeup so it wouldn't be noticeable. I scanned the members of 'Just' one by one with a terrified face in this unfamiliar place. [Shall I cry now that I'm in a strange place?] This was my planned first scene. A baby bursting into tears due to tension. The members of 'Just' doing their best to soothe the baby! [Hmm. Hm.] I cleared my throat and cried with all my might. \\"Mommy! Daddy!\\" Michael quickly picked me up. [A quick-witted guy.] Obviously, he was scheming to secure his screen time. But if I stopped crying with just this, it wouldn't be enough for the screen time... I had no choice. I cried even louder. Soon, the handsome Jaehyun snatched me up. I looked at Jaehyun and gradually stopped crying at the right timing. \\"Even the baby likes pretty people.\\" The members reacted to me stopping crying in Jaehyun's arms, and then the muscle doll, Lukas, tried to hold me. \\"Seongguk-ah, come here. I'm your hyung, your hyung.\\" The situation of being confused in an unfamiliar place. The scene where I cried when Michael held me and then calmed down when Jaehyun held me was all planned. Suddenly, Lukas was a bit confusing. [How should I set up my relationship with this guy?] Suddenly, Lukas's thick palm appeared in front of me. I quickly tapped Lukas's palm with my small hand, as if playing a game. \\"Seongguk also noticed right away that Lukas likes to play. Looks like he wants to play with Lukas.\\" As Taehyung expected, I set Lukas as a friend. The reliable leader, Taehyung, is dad. The kind-hearted handsome Jaehyun is mom. Muscle doll Lukas is a friend. Awkward relationship with the shy Beomseon. Playful rivalry with Michael. I quickly finished setting up the relationships in my head. And then I smiled brightly. [Please take care of me, 'Just'.] All members of 'Just' gathered around me. \\"Seongguk-ah, let's get along well from now on.\\" As the leader, Taehyung spoke, everyone waved their hands at me. I relaxed a bit and smiled awkwardly. Although it was unfamiliar, the first meeting with 'Just', who sincerely approached me, couldn't have been better for an ending. \\"Cut! Let's move on to the next!\\" The director's satisfied voice was heard. * * * The break time started. Next to my mom, who was now quite full, I began analyzing the five members of 'Just'. To concentrate, I buried my face into my mom's belly. [Mom smells nice. Hehe.] \\"Seongguk-ah, do you like mom that much?\\" \\"Yeees!\\" I responded enthusiastically. Mom laughed brightly and showered my cheeks with kisses. [Mom, I'm almost 18 months old now. And I'm getting a sibling soon, why are you doing this? It's embarrassing.] As I struggled, mom hugged me even tighter. The eldest member of 'Just', Taehyung, ran over and offered snacks and water. \\"Are you tired, mother?\\" \\"No.\\" \\"But, mother, you really look young.\\" [Taehyung, you're the same age as her.] \\"Then, mother, rest and let me know if you need anything.\\" \\"Thank you. Really.\\" Mom smiled bashfully and couldn't take her eyes off Taehyung's retreating back. [Mom, why are you like this? Is it because they're handsome? Huh?] Mom smiled continuously as she ate the snack Taehyung gave her. \\"Seongguk-ah, all the members of 'Just' are so handsome.\\" [Mom, I'm going to tell dad everything!] \\"Seongguk-ah, this is a secret from dad!\\" Mom quickly sealed my mouth with a kiss. [This makes me weak...] \\"Alright, we're starting filming again!\\" The assistant director's voice was heard. Mom held me and headed to the filming site. I stretched my arms, brushed back my hair, and dusted off my onesie. [Let's start filming.] * * * The daytime filming with mom went smoothly for the most part. Mom was somewhere behind the camera, and all I had to do was act freely without being conscious of the camera, and everyone was thrilled, calling me cute. And then came the last night's filming, where I had to spend the night with the 'Just' members. Since mom was pregnant, she decided to sleep at a small hotel nearby with dad. To prepare for any possible incidents, a few members of the production team kept an eye on the rotating cameras throughout the night. Dad, worried even though he had left mom at the hotel, stayed with the filming team and watched the cameras all night. The director also gave me one piece of advice before leaving. \\"Seongguk-ah, just sleep well, eat well, and poop well.\\" [Don't worry, Director. Even if I wanted to, I can't control those things at this age.] The director also sternly warned the members of 'Just'. \\"Seongguk is only 18 months old. You all know that, right?\\" \\"Yes!\\" \\"Really, be careful.\\" \\"Don't worry, Director. I'm here.\\" Michael approached with a confident smile. \\"Alright, I'm counting on you.\\" If there was one person in the world not to trust, it was Michael. Soon, the filming team filmed their departure, leaving only two observation cameras running in the corners. \\"Who wants to prepare Seongguk's dinner?\\" Taehyung asked the members. Then Michael quickly volunteered. \\"I'll do it!\\" \\"You?\\" The members all looked at Michael with puzzled faces. \\"Really, you're going to do it?\\" From Jaehyun's expression alone, it was clear that Michael, this guy, was definitely trying to grab some screen time out of greed."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[엄마, 나 마이클 때문에 한숨도 못 잤어.] 나는 얼른 마이클을 손가락질하며 옹알거렸다. “성국아, 엄마 많이 보고 싶었어?” [그걸 말이라고 해!] 나는 대성통곡하며 엄마의 품에 안겼다. “으아앙. 엄. 마! 으아앙. 엄. 마!” * * * 21.9% ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 파일럿 프로가 주말 최고 시청률을 기록하면서 화제를 일으켰다. 정규 방송으로 편성해 달라는 시청자 의견으로 방송국 전화가 난리가 났다. 학교는 물론 회사나 시장에서도 저스트의 인기 상승과 더불어 세탁기 광고로 얼굴을 알린 나에 대한 이야기들이 넘쳐났다. 엄마를 찾아온 단발머리가 이런 나의 인기에 대해서 설명해주고 있었다. 엄마는 반응이 좋다는 이야기를 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 감독한테 들었을 뿐이다. “107호, 다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 반응 장난 아니에요. 우리 회사에서도 다들 성국이 이야기뿐이에요.” “저스트 이야기가 아니라, 우리 성국이 이야기를 그렇게 해요?” “저스트 이야기도 많이 하죠. 근데 그 관계성 중심에 다 성국이가 있잖아요. 벌써 다들 태형이는 아빠, 재현은 엄마. 마이클은 앙숙. 이렇게 관계를 정해서 말한다니까요. 성국이가 완전 주인공이에요.” 나는 흐뭇한 미소를 지었다. 그러곤 다리에 힘을 팍 넣고 낮은 선반에 손을 댄 채 걸어 다니는 연습을 했다. 정규 방송에 편성되면 첫 녹화에서 나의 걸음마 연습을 자연스럽게 유도하려는 의도였다. 단발머리가 나를 흘깃 쳐다봤다. “성국이는 마치 스타가 되려고 태어난 애 같아요.” [무슨 소리야. 내가 겨우 연예인 나부랭이나 되려고 태어난 줄 알아? 내 목표는 재벌이라고! 이건 재벌이 되기 위한 첫 단추일 뿐이라고. 단발머리.] 나는 두 주먹을 앙 쥐었다! 엄마가 나를 물끄러미 쳐다봤다. “언니, 근데 전 너무 걱정이에요. 아직 두 돌도 안 지난 아이한테는 스케줄이 너무 힘든 것 같아서요. 마지막 밤 촬영 끝나고 아침에 갔는데 성국이가 나 붙잡고 정말 많이 울었거든요.” [그건 마이클 때문에 화가 많이 나서 울은 거야. 분노의 눈물이랄까.] 엄마는 조용히 말을 이었다. “감독님께 정규 편성돼도 성국이가 힘들어해서 안 한다고 하니까요, 감독님이 출연료뿐 아니라 모든 거 다 배려해 준다고 집까지 찾아오셔서 사정사정하셨거든요.” “이 일을 왜 안 해요?” [내 말이!] 단발머리가 더 열을 냈다. “성국이 겨우 돌 지났는데, 이제 곧 둘째도 나오고… 제가 성국이 다 쫓아다닐 수 없을 것 같아서요.” “성국이도 이쪽에 재능 있는 것 같으니까, 107호가 계속 붙잡고 있지 말고 기획사 알아봐요.” “기획사요? 아, 맞다.” 엄마는 선반 위에 둔 명함 하나를 단발머리에게 내밀었다. “언니가 그래도 저보다 잘 아시잖아요. 임선미 씨가 준 명함이거든요. 자기 소속사 추천한다고요. 언니, 이 기획사 아세요?” “신성 기획이네요.” 단발머리의 미간이 구겨졌다. 동시에 내 미간도 구겨졌다. 내가 깜빡한 사실이 하나 있었다. 임선미가 있던 신성 기획은 연예인과 재벌 사이를 연결해줘서 성장한 기획사 중에 하나였다. 그리고 그 신성 기획의 대표 신성중은 내가 싫어하는 인간 종류였다. 가난한 시골 출신으로 로드 매니저로 시작해서 신성 기획의 대표가 된 만큼 일에 수단과 방법을 가리지 않았다. 아버지 전재형은 시골 출신으로 연예계에 자리 잡은 신성중을 나름 높게 평가했지만, 나는 아니었다. 그리고 내 철칙 중 하나는 아버지의 사람과는 어떤 식으로든 엮이지 않겠다는 것이었다. 그들은 아버지를 믿고 종종 나에게 무리한 요구를 하거나 아버지 때처럼 대해줄 것을 원했기 때문이다. 감히 나, 전성국에게! 신성 기획과의 계약은 어떤 식으로든 막아야 했다. [엄마, 계약은 신중해야 한다고….] 나는 얼른 엄마를 향해 걸어갔다. 이때, 엄마가 놀란 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 지금 걷는 거야?” [어… 이게….] 분명 지금 나는 아무것도 잡지 않고 걷고 있었다. 물론 다리에 힘이 수시로 빠져서 휘청거렸지만, 분명 나는 어떤 것에도 의지하지 않고 걷고 있었다. “엄. 마!” 나는 다시 걷기 시작했다. 아장아장. “어머, 성국아.” 엄마는 감격스러운 표정으로 두 팔을 벌렸다. 그리고 나는 그 품에 쏙 안겼다. 따뜻한 엄마의 품. 엄마에게서는 깨끗한 비누향이 났다. [아, 이게 진짜 엄마의 품이구나.] 회귀 전 철의 여인에게서는 언제나 짙은 향수 냄새가 났다. 내 최초의 기억을 더듬어 봐도 그녀에게 안긴 건 몇 번 없었다. 나는 언제든 원하면 폭 안길 수 있는 지금의 엄마 품에서 잠시 취했다. 산통을 깬 건 단발머리였다. “107호, 신성 기획이 좀 말이 많은 데긴 하지만 임선미가 추천한 데니 우선 만나봐요. 기획사는 여러 군데 만나보고, 그중에서 가장 좋은 조건을 제시하는 곳이랑 계약해야 해요.” “경리로 일할 땐 계약서도 잘 보고 그랬는데, 너무 집에만 있어나 봐요. 그리고… 서울은 좀 무섭기도 하고요. 언니가 같이 가주시면 안 돼요? 삼전 기획 경리부에서 일하시니 저보다는 훨씬 잘 아실 거잖아요.” 나는 엄마를 다시 봤다. 엄마는 경력자인 단발머리에게 도움을 청하고 있었다. 자신의 부족한 지점을 정확히 알고, 조력자를 곁에 두는 것. 그것이야말로 비즈니스에서 가장 중요한 지점이었다. 단발머리는 잠시 고민하더니 고개를 끄덕였다. “어서 임선미가 준 명함에 나온 데로 전화해봐요. 나도 이 바닥 이야기는 좀 아니 도와줄게요.” “언니, 정말 감사해요.” 나는 얼른 속으로 외쳤다. [그래도, 신성 기획은 절대 안 돼!] 나는 엄마의 옷깃을 잡아당겼지만, 엄마는 알아듣지 못했다. * * * 엄마와 나 그리고 단발머리는 93년도로 치면 최신식으로 꾸며진 신성 기획의 사무실 안에서 계약서를 보고 있었다. 세기말이 다가오고 있어서 그런가. 신성 기획의 사무실은 퇴폐적인 분위기로 가득했다. 우리 앞에는 신성 기획의 아이라인이 두꺼운 직원이 앉아서 눈치를 슬금슬금 살피고 있었다. 나는 곁눈질로 단발머리와 엄마가 보는 계약서를 읽어 내렸다. [계약 기간 10년? 수익 배분율은 5 대 5? 장난하나, 이것들이.] 한마디로 이건 거의 노예 계약이었다. 계약 기간과 수익 배분율 자체가 이해할 수 없었다. 나는 엄마와 단발머리를 번갈아봤다. 이런 일에는 엄마보다 단발머리가 더 나아 보였다. 나는 얼른 단발머리의 계약서를 두 손으로 탁탁 내려쳤다. [여기 좀 보라고!] 특히 기간과 수익 배분율이 있는 곳을 콕 집어서. “성국아, 이러면 안 돼.” 엄마가 나를 얼른 말렸다. 단발머리는 빙긋 미소를 짓더니 내가 손으로 툭툭 내려친 조항들을 다시 세밀히 살폈다. 그러곤 고개를 들어 직원을 쳐다봤다. “이 조항들 그대로 계약해야 하는 건 아니죠?” “왜 그러세요?” 직원의 자신 없는 말투가 들렸다. 저 말투는 이미 계약 조항을 바꿀 수 없다는 뉘앙스였다. [신성 기획은 신인이라면 골수까지 빨아먹는 회사라고! 노예 계약은 사양할게!] 나는 화난 투로 종알거렸다. “계약 기간이랑 수익 배분 같은 것은 좀 조율할 게 보여서요. 그리고 디테일한 사항들도 꽤 많이 조율해야 할 것 같고요.” 직원이 당황하는 게 보였다. “대표님께 한번 여쭤보고 오겠습니다.” “네.” 나는 팔짱을 끼고 단발머리를 쳐다봤다. [어쭈, 단발머리 제법인데.] * * * 달칵. 잠시 후 회의실의 문이 열리면서 신성중이 직접 들어왔다. 나는 팔짱을 끼고 신성중을 찬찬히 훑었다. 기름진 얼굴. 올백으로 넘긴 머리. 화려한 셔츠가 그의 트레이드 마크였다. [신 대표, 오랜만이네요. 머리숱이 아직까지는 참 많네.] 내가 죽기 전, 마지막으로 신성중을 봤을 때는 머리가 훤하게 벗겨져 있었다. 신성중은 두 손을 비비며 맞은편 자리에 앉았다. 저 제스처가 진짜 나는 싫었다. 마치 이제 내가 이야기를 시작할 거고, 난 고귀한 척 같은 건 안 하는 장사치다, 라는 사실을 온몸으로 표현하는 것 같았다. “얘가 성국이군요. 화면도 잘 받던데, 실물로 보니 더 이쁘네요. 될 놈은 떡잎부터 알아본다더니, 이 녀석 두고 하는 말인가 봐요.” [이 녀석이라니. 어디서 하대야, 신 대표.] 신성중의 시선이 엄마에게로 향했다. “사모님도 미인이시네요. 역시 이 바닥은 유전자가 정말 중요하죠.” 그러곤 단발머리를 쳐다봤다. “같이 오신 분은 이모? 고모?” “이웃인데요. 삼전 기획 다니는 김미영이라고 합니다.” 그때 난 처음으로 단발머리의 이름을 알았다. 김미영. “아하.” 신성중은 짧게 인사를 마치고는 본론으로 들어갔다. “그래, 계약서에서 뭐가 마음에 안 든다고 하신 것 같은데요.” “계약 기간이랑 수익 배분이요. 아시다시피 성국이가 완전 신인은 아니잖아요. 그런데 계약 기간 10년에 5 대 5 비율은 아닌 것 같아서요. 이미 성국이 방송 끝나기만을 기다리는 광고도 수두룩하고요.” 김미영이 툭 치고 나갔다. 그리고 쐐기까지 박았다. “같이 일한 감독님들이 다른 기획사도 추천해 주셨는데, 그래도 임선미 씨가 추천한 곳이라 여기 제일 먼저 온 거거든요.” [신성중 같은 인간은 권위에 약하지. 잘했어, 단발머리.] 나는 김미영의 등을 두 번 토닥여줬다. 신성중이 못마땅한 얼굴로 두 손을 파리처럼 비벼댔다. 신성중은 전형적인 강약약강의 인물이었다. 지금 그에게 혹처럼 딸려온 김미영은 그저 귀찮은 존재일 뿐이었다. “그건 잘 알죠. 요즘 광고계에서 성국이가 블루칩 아닙니까. 근데 말입니다….” 신성중은 뜸을 들였다. 자신의 의견을 피력하기에 앞서 상대방의 눈치를 가늠해보는 중이었다. 곧 신성중은 판단을 끝내고 입을 열었다. “베이비 모델 시장이 생각보다 그렇게 넓지 않습니다. 출연료도 성인 연기자에 비하면 턱도 없고요. 거기다 뭐, 대화도 안 통하고 그러다 보니 광고 촬영 시간도 길어지고, 그럼 저희 회사 직원들도 스탠바이 상태로 계속 있어야 하지 않습니까.” [우리를 졸로 봤네.] 신성중은 남루한 차림의 임신한 엄마와 어린 나, 그리고 삼전 기획의 경리부에서 일하는 단발머리를 보고는 한눈에 깔아뭉갤 상대로 본 게 분명했다. 나는 삐딱하게 팔짱을 끼고 신성중의 말을 들었다. 내 대답은 정해져 있었지만, 대체 어떻게 말을 둘러치나 듣고 있었다. “그리고 애 얼굴은 1년에 열두 번도 더 변하지 않습니까. 성국이 지금 이쁘지만, 한 달 후에는 또 다른 얼굴이 나타나고. 솔직히 잠깐의 인기 후에 얼굴 변해서 광고 제의도 줄고. 그런데도 저희의 고정 지출은 있지 않겠습니까.” “한마디로, 계약 조건 바꾸는 것은 불가능하다, 그 말씀이죠?” 김미영이 끼어들었다. 내 속이 다 시원했다. 신성중이 손바닥을 다 보이며 허허 웃음을 터트렸다. “저희 회사 입장을 말씀드리는 거죠. 선미 부탁도 있고, 저도 성국이 같은 스타감이랑 꼭 계약하고 싶어서 이렇게 연락드렸습니다.” 어떻게든 자신에게 유리한 계약을 하려는 수작이었다. 더 들을 말 따위는 없었다. 나는 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. 엄마가 나를 얼른 안으려고 했지만, 나는 휘청거리며 문을 향해 걸어갔다. 나의 결연한 의지와 상관없이 엉덩이는 뒤뚱거렸다. “성국아!” 안 나오고 뭐 해. 엄마! 단발머리도 자리를 박차고 일어났다. 그러곤 신성중을 쳐다봤다. “저희는 제시하신 조건으로는 계약하기 힘들 것 같습니다. 생각해 보시고 관심 있으시면 계약 조건 조율하셔서 다시 연락 주시죠.” [단발머리, 나이스!]","completion":"Episode 11 \\"Alright, let's trust Michael today.\\" When the eldest member of the group, Taehyung, defended Michael, the other members reluctantly went to prepare for bed. I stealthily crawled to the kitchen. I could walk by holding onto the walls, but crawling was still more comfortable when moving quickly. At that moment, Beomseon caught me with one arm. \\"Sungguk, the kitchen is dangerous.\\" [I have to watch what that guy is going to mess with the food. Do you guys trust Michael?] As I babbled, Beomseon carried me into the kitchen. \\"Michael, what's for Sungguk's dinner?\\" \\"Uh... Baby food. The porridge-like thing that Sungguk's mother made during the day.\\" \\"But what's that behind you?\\" As Beomseon tried to see behind Michael, Michael quickly hid something behind his back. \\"What do you mean there's something behind me?\\" Michael snapped back. It was proof that he was caught. \\"Hey, show me what you're trying to prank with!\\" At Beomseon's voice, all the members rushed over. \\"Michael, what are you hiding behind? Show us.\\" At Taehyung's words, Michael suddenly smiled brightly and presented hot sauce. \\"Guys, I was going to add it to the baby food for fun. But, I haven't added it yet.\\" [You little! You dare to sprinkle hot sauce on my sacred meal!] As I squirmed, Beomseon held me tighter. Taehyung's face turned grim. Then he gritted his teeth and whispered to Michael. \\"This time, I'll let it slide. Just try playing pranks like this again.\\" Taehyung quickly snatched the hot sauce. That night, Michael kept picking on me. He threw ping pong balls at me, who was just sitting still, and when I started to feel sleepy, he blew a squeaky toy horn next to me. I was so startled that I cried my eyes out. Thanks to the other members who defended me like an iron wall, I was able to safely get through the night. It was the first night without mom. As soon as the door opened, I saw mom's silhouette. I crawled towards mom with all my strength, holding onto the walls. \\"Mom. Mom!\\" Then I clung to mom's skirt, crying and sniffling. [Mom, I couldn't sleep at all because of Michael.] I quickly pointed at Michael and babbled. \\"Sungguk, did you miss mom a lot?\\" [Is that even a question!] I cried loudly and hugged mom. \\"Mom! Mom!\\" * * * 21.9% The pilot episode of 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' recorded the highest weekend viewership, causing a sensation. The broadcasting station was flooded with calls from viewers requesting it to be scheduled for regular broadcasting. At school, in companies, and in the market, there was a lot of talk about the rising popularity of Just and me, who became known through a washing machine advertisement. A woman with short hair came to explain to mom about my popularity. Mom had only heard from the director of 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' that the response was good. \\"Room 107, the response to 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' is no joke. Everyone at our company is only talking about Sungguk.\\" \\"Are they talking about Just, not just our Sungguk?\\" \\"They talk a lot about Just too. But they specifically talk about Sungguk being at the center of their relationship. Everyone already labels Taehyung as the dad, Jaehyun as the mom, and Michael as the nemesis. Sungguk is totally the main character.\\" I smiled contentedly. Then, I put strength into my legs and practiced walking by touching a low shelf. It was intended to naturally induce my walking practice during the first recording if it was scheduled for regular broadcasting. The woman with short hair glanced at me. \\"Sungguk seems like he was born to be a star.\\" [What are you talking about? Do you think I was born to be some entertainer? My goal is to be a conglomerate! This is just the first step towards becoming a conglomerate, short hair.] I clenched my fists! Mom looked at me thoughtfully. \\"But I'm really worried. It seems too hard for a child not even two years old to have such a schedule. After the last night of shooting, I went in the morning, and Sungguk clung to me and cried a lot.\\" [That was because I was so angry at Michael. Tears of rage.] Mom continued quietly. \\"The director said if it gets regularly scheduled, they'll take care of everything, not just the appearance fee, and even came to our house to plead.\\" \\"Why wouldn't you do it?\\" [Exactly!] Short hair became more passionate. \\"Sungguk is barely over a year old, and soon the second child will be born... I don't think I can follow Sungguk around.\\" \\"Sungguk seems to have talent in this field, so don't just hold onto him in room 107, look for an agency.\\" \\"An agency? Oh, right.\\" Mom handed a business card to short hair. \\"You know better than me, sister. It's from Lim Sunmi. She recommended her agency. Sister, do you know this agency?\\" \\"Shinseong Planning.\\" Short hair frowned. At the same time, I frowned too. I had forgotten one thing. Shinseong Planning, where Lim Sunmi was, was one of the agencies that grew by connecting entertainers and conglomerates. And Shinseong Planning's representative, Shin Sungjung, was the type of person I disliked. Starting as a road manager from a poor rural background and becoming the representative of Shinseong Planning, he was ruthless in his work. My father, Jeon Jaehyung, respected Shin Sungjung for making a place in the entertainment industry from a rural background, but I did not. And one of my principles was not to get involved with my father's people in any way. They trusted my father and often made unreasonable demands or wanted to be treated like they were by my father. How dare they, to me, Jeon Sungguk! I had to block the contract with Shinseong Planning in any way. [Mom, contracts need to be careful...] I quickly walked towards mom. At that moment, mom looked at me with surprised eyes. \\"Sungguk, are you walking now?\\" [Uh... this is...] Sure enough, I was walking without holding onto anything. Of course, my legs were wobbly and I staggered, but I was definitely walking without leaning on anything. \\"Mom!\\" I started walking again. Step by step. \\"Oh my, Sungguk.\\" Mom opened her arms with a moved expression. And I snugly fit into her embrace. The warm embrace of mom. From mom, a clean scent of soap wafted. [Ah, this is really the embrace of mom.] Before my regression, the iron lady always smelled strongly of perfume. Even when I tried to recall my earliest memories, I was rarely hugged by her. I indulged for a moment in the embrace of my current mom, where I could hug her anytime I wanted. Short hair broke the silence. \\"Room 107, although Shinseong Planning has a lot of talk, since Lim Sunmi recommended it, let's meet them first. You should meet several agencies and contract with the one that offers the best conditions.\\" \\"I used to check contracts well when I worked in accounting, but maybe I've been staying at home too much. And... Seoul is a bit scary. Can you come with me, sister? Since you work in the accounting department of Samjeon Planning, you must know much better than me.\\" I looked at mom again. Mom was asking for help from short hair, who was an experienced person. Knowing exactly where she lacked and keeping a helper by her side. That was the most important point in business. Short hair hesitated for a moment, then nodded. \\"Call the number on the business card Lim Sunmi gave you. I know a bit about this industry, so I'll help.\\" \\"Thank you so much, sister.\\" I shouted inwardly. [But still, Shinseong Planning is absolutely not!] I tugged at mom's clothes, but mom didn't understand. * * * Mom, me, and short hair were looking at the contract in the office of Shinseong Planning, which was decorated in the latest style for 1993. As the end of the century approached, Shinseong Planning's office was filled with a decadent atmosphere. In front of us sat an employee of Shinseong Planning with thick eyeliner, sneakily glancing at us. I skimmed the contract that mom and short hair were looking at with a side glance. [Contract period 10 years? Revenue distribution ratio 5 to 5? Are they joking, these people?] In a word, this was almost a slave contract. The contract period and revenue distribution ratio itself were incomprehensible. I looked back and forth between mom and short hair. In this matter, short hair seemed better than mom. I quickly slapped the contract that short hair was looking at with both hands. [Look here!] Especially pointing out the parts about the period and revenue distribution ratio. \\"Sungguk, you shouldn't do this.\\" Mom quickly stopped me. Short hair smiled slightly, then looked closely again at the clauses I had tapped. Then she looked up at the employee. \\"These clauses aren't set in stone, right?\\" \\"Why do you say that?\\" The employee's uncertain tone was heard. That tone already implied that changing the contract clauses was impossible. [Shinseong Planning is a company that sucks the marrow out of newcomers! A slave contract is declined!] I babbled angrily. \\"The contract period and revenue distribution, you know. Considering Sungguk is not a complete newcomer. But a 10-year contract with a 5 to 5 ratio doesn't seem right. There are already countless advertisements waiting just for Sungguk's broadcast to end.\\" Short hair cut in. And she drove the final nail. \\"Directors who worked with us recommended other agencies, but we came here first because Lim Sunmi recommended this place.\\" [People like Shin Sungjung are weak to authority. Well done, short hair.] I patted short hair's back twice. Shin Sungjung rubbed his hands together with a displeased face. Shin Sungjung was a typical strong-against-the-weak, weak-against-the-strong character. To him, short hair, who had tagged along, was just an annoying existence. \\"Of course, I know. These days, Sungguk is a blue chip in the advertising world. But, you see...\\" Shin Sungjung hesitated. He was gauging the other party's reaction before presenting his opinion. Soon, Shin Sungjung made his judgment and opened his mouth. \\"The baby model market is not as wide as you think. The appearance fee is nothing compared to adult actors. Plus, you know, communication doesn't work, and so the advertising shooting time gets longer, and then our company employees have to stay on standby, right?\\" [They're looking down on us.] Shin Sungjung saw the shabbily dressed pregnant mom, young me, and short hair, who worked in the accounting department of Samjeon Planning, and immediately judged us as easy targets to crush. I crossed my arms and listened to Shin Sungjung's words. My answer was already decided, but I was curious how he would beat around the bush. \\"And the baby's face changes maybe twelve times a year, right? Sungguk is pretty now, but a month later, a different face appears. Honestly, after a brief popularity, the face changes, and the advertising offers decrease. But our fixed expenses are still there, right?\\" \\"In other words, it's impossible to change the contract conditions, is that what you're saying?\\" Short hair intervened. I felt utterly refreshed. Shin Sungjung showed his palms and burst into laughter. \\"I'm just explaining our company's position. Sunmi also asked for a favor, and I really wanted to sign a contract with a star material like Sungguk, so I contacted you.\\" He was trying to secure a contract advantageous to him by any means. There was no need to listen further. I stood up abruptly. Mom tried to hold me quickly, but I staggered towards the door. Regardless of my determined will, my buttocks wobbled. \\"Sungguk!\\" What are you doing, not coming out. Mom! Short hair also stood up with a kick and looked at Shin Sungjung. \\"It seems difficult for us to sign with the conditions you've offered. Think it over and if you're still interested, contact us again after adjusting the contract conditions.\\" [Short hair, nice!]"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[경쟁자 녀석….] 옆자리에 앉아 있던 김미영을 엄마는 물끄러미 봤다. 신성 기획을 나온 이후로 단발머리는 단 한 마디도 하지 않았다. 엄마는 김미영의 눈치를 슬쩍 살폈다. “언니, 저한테 무슨 할 말 있죠?” “있긴 한데….” 김미영은 말을 아꼈다. 그때, 엄마가 먼저 김미영의 손을 훅 잡았다. “언니, 혹시 우리 성국이 매니저 안 해볼래요?” 안 그래도 나도 그 생각을 막 했다. 삼전 기획에서 경리부지만 과장까지 단 여자이다. 거기다 최후의 고졸 사원이다. 그 정도의 끈기라면 내 매니저로 합격점이었다. 나는 칭찬의 의미로 엄마의 배를 두 번 도닥였다. 토닥토닥. 나는 얼른 김미영을 봤다. [단발머리, 내가 거절할 수 없는 제안을 할 거야.] 그 순간, 엄마가 내 배를 도닥였다. “성국아, 잠시만 조용히 해줘.” [쳇. 어쩔 수 없지.] 나는 입은 닫고, 팔짱은 끼고 김미영을 매섭게 쳐다봤다. 김미영은 나와 엄마를 번갈아 보더니 천천히 입을 열었다. “안 그래도, 내가 그 말 먼저 하려고 했는데. 107호한테 선수 빼앗겼네요.” [김미영, 지금 뭐라고 한 거야? 진짜 한다는 거지?] 나도 놀랐고, 엄마도 놀랐다. “언니도 생각한 일이에요?” 끄덕. 김미영은 고개를 짧게 끄덕였다. “근데… 언니 회사는 어쩔 생각이세요?” “그만 다니려고요. 30대 후반의 노처녀, 회사에서 반가워하지도 않거든요. 모아둔 돈으로 창업 준비 하려고 했는데… 성국이 매니지먼트를 내가 해보면 어떨까 잠시 상상은 해봤어요.” 단발머리는 차분하게 말을 이었다. “계약 조건이야 당연히 신성 기획보다 좋을 거고, 내가 그동안 경리부에서 일한 경력 있으니 돈 문제는 깔끔하게 처리할 거예요. 삼전 기획에서 매니저들이 일하는 방식이나 관리하는 거 많이 봤어요.” 김미영은 이미 계약 조건부터 자신의 어필까지 모든 것을 다 생각하고 있었다. [단발머리, 다 계획이 있었구나.] 나는 엄마의 원피스 자락을 세차게 잡아당겼다. 단발머리 정도면 내가 재벌이 되는 데 좋은 발판이 되어줄 인재였다. [엄마, 계약서 쓰자고 해!] 마치 엄마는 내 말을 알아들은 것처럼 결심한 듯 고개를 끄덕였다. “언니, 솔직하게 이야기할게요.” “편하게 말해요. 거절도 괜찮아요.” 김미영의 목소리는 여전히 담담했다. “언니, 성국이 아직 어리고, 저희 가난하지만 성국이 힘든 모습 보면서까지 연예인 시키고 싶지 않거든요. 제가 예정일이 얼마 안 남아 알아본 건데요. 이번 일만 하고 성국이 더는 안 할 수도 있어요.” “그럼 더 잘됐네요. 저런 회사는 묶이면 기본 10년이잖아요. 나는 성국이가 일 그만두면 그때 계약 해지하는 걸로 해요.” “언니….” “나도 새로운 일을 시작해보고 싶어서 그런 거니까, 나한테 고마워할 것도 미안해할 것도 없어요. 물론 나도 일한 만큼 보수는 받을 거고요.” 이보다 더 좋은 조건은 없어 보였다. 나는 다시 엄마의 옷을 잡아당겼다. [어서 같이 일하자고 해, 엄마.] “언니…. 염치없지만, 성국이 매니저로 저 좀 도와주실래요?” “당연하죠.” 단발머리는 확신에 차서 대답했다. 나는 배에 두 팔을 올린 채 단발머리를 물끄러미 쳐다봤다. [김미영 씨, 앞으로 내가 지켜볼 테니 잘해야 해.] “열심히도 종알거리네. 앞으로 잘 부탁해, 성국아.” 김미영이 단호하게 말했다. 우리 엄마와 아빠는 비록 고아로 태어나 외롭게 자라고 공부도 제대로 못 했지만, 대신 하늘에서 인복이라는 것을 내린 게 분명하다. 똑 부러지는 집주인을 만나고, 거기다 나 같은 준비된 재벌을 만나다니…. 나는 엄마를 꼭 안았다. 엄마의 부른 배 때문에 거슬리긴 했지만, 이 배 속에 들어 있는 동생이란 놈도 천운을 타고 태어난 건 마찬가지이다. 왜냐하면 나 전성국이 이 집안을 일으켜 세울 것이기 때문이다. 나는 엄마의 배를 통통 쳤다. [동생, 넌 적어도 14K 금수저 예약이야.] * * * “다섯 남자와 아기 바구니가 저번 주에 시청률 25%를 넘겼습니다! 오늘 끝나고 회사에서 회식 준비했으니 다들 참여해 주세요.” ‘저스트’의 매니저가 크게 소리쳤다. 다섯 남자와 아기 바구니의 인기 덕분에 수많은 신인 그룹 중 하나였던 ‘저스트’의 인기도 덩달아 급상승했다. “자, 회사에서 산다니 다들 참석하고. 촬영 들어가자고!” 감독의 한마디에 다시 주변은 조용해졌다. 엄마 역할을 맡은 꽃미남 재현이 나를 안아 올렸다. 이때, 부엌에서 마이클이 바나나를 입에 물고 나오자 재현이 기겁했다. “마이클, 그거 성국이 거야. 그걸 네가 먹으면 어떡해!” “나는 입도 아니야? 배고파 죽겠어.” “아우, 진짜. 넌 언제 철들래?” 재현은 마이클을 타박했지만, 마이클은 나를 보며 혀를 날름 내밀며 메롱을 했다. 나는 또 거기에 맞춰서 마이클을 한 대 칠 기세로 손발을 바동거렸다. 내가 설정한 ‘저스트’ 다섯 멤버와의 관계성에서 의외로 마이클과의 앙숙 관계가 엄청난 사랑을 받았다. 첫 밤 촬영 때, 마이클이 내 이유식에 핫소스를 뿌리려던 모습이나 밤새 나를 괴롭힌 모습이 마치 아직 덜 자란 어른 같은 천진난만함으로 편집됐다. 거기다 자막까지 ‘철없는 막내는 새로 생긴 동생이 부럽나 봅니다.’ 이렇게 박는 바람에 졸지에 마이클은 마치 막둥이에게 사랑을 다 빼앗겨버린 형이 되었다. 정말 악마의 편집이었다. 각종 게시판에서는 나와 마이클의 관계를 톰과 제리에 비유하기도 했다. 이제 마이클은 아예 어린아이와 같은 유딩의 면모를 더욱 부각했다. 사람들은 나와 마이클을 엮어 ‘유딩즈’라고 부르기도 했다. 이제 아빠 역할의 태형이 나서서 이 상황을 정리하면 오늘의 한 에피소드는 마무리다. “마이클 그만! 재현, 성국이 얼굴 안 좋네. 기저귀 한번 봐.” “어, 형.” [뭐야, 또 아랫도리 까야 하나.] 아무리 모자이크 처리해서 나간다지만, 태형의 에피소드 정리 방식은 언제나 기저귀 갈기 아니면 우유 먹이기 같은 원초적인 것이었다. 재현이 얼른 바지를 벗겼다. 곧 아랫도리가 시원해졌다. “성국이 아직 오줌 안 쌌는데.” 카메라가 불쑥 들어와 나를 찍어댔다. [그렇다면 제대로 오줌 한번 날려줄까?] 나는 있는 힘껏 인상을 쓰고는, 그대로 카메라를 향해 오줌을 뿜었다. [준비하시고… 발사!] “컷!” 감독의 목소리가 들리자마자 스태프들이 웃음을 터트렸다. 감독도 흥분에 들뜬 목소리였다. “오늘 완전 대박이야. 어쩜 때맞춰 오줌도 싸주냐. 우리 성국이 진짜 천재 아니야? 이번 편 시청률 또 오르겠는데. 이러다 우리 30프로도 넘는 거 아니야? 자, 30분만 쉬고 다시 촬영 들어가겠습니다.” 감독의 칭찬이 이어졌다. 촬영 스태프들도 모두들 극찬을 아끼지 않았다. [이런 관심과 환호. 저번 생과 별반 다를 게 없군.] 나는 모두의 관심을 온몸에 받았다. 엄마가 얼른 다가와 바지를 입히고, 내 손에 바나나를 쥐여줬다. 나는 물컹한 바나나를 앞니로 아작아작 씹었다. “성국아, 안 힘들어?” [엄마, 원래 돈 버는 건 힘든 거야. 이 정도야 뭐. 삼전 그룹 부회장으로 있을 때는 정말 스트레스 때문에 원형 탈모도 왔었다고.] 엄마는 내 엉덩이를 도닥이더니 옆에 선 스태프에게 나를 부탁했다. “쓰레기 좀 버리고 올게요. 성국이 좀 봐주세요.” “네, 걱정 말고 다녀오세요.” 나는 뽀송뽀송한 기저귀를 차고는 잠시 몸을 뒤척였다. [이번 기저귀는 쓸 만하네. 역시 돈이 좋아.] 한동안 몸에 맞지 않는 기저귀 때문에 피부가 쓸려서 꽤 고생을 했었다. 그 이후로 좀 더 비싼 기저귀로 바뀌고 나서 발진도 더는 일지 않았다. 이때, 마이클이 가까이 오더니 나를 슬쩍 건드렸다. “자식, 너 아까 진짜 발로 나 한 대 치려고 했지?” [지금 이 녀석이 나랑 해보자는 건가.] 마이클 이 자식은 얄밉게 생겨서는 인성은 더 쓰레기였다. 나는 고개를 휙 돌려버렸다. 이런 건 안 보는 게 인성에 도움이 된다. “야, 너 지금 나 무시해?” [가지가지 백만 가지 하네, 진짜.] “너, 뭐라고 종알거리는 거야! 내 말이 말 같지 않아?” 나는 두 손으로 귀를 틀어막아 버렸다. [안 들려. 안 들려.] 약 올라 하는 마이클의 얼굴이 보였다. 순간, 허리가 따끔했다. 마이클이 손가락으로 내 허리 살을 꼬집고 있었다. [지금 감히 이 전성국을 꼬집은 거냐? 어?!] 나는 얼른 전투 자세를 취했다. 이런 자식은 철저히 짓밟아줘야 기어오르지 않았다. 나는 주먹을 콩 쥐고 마이클을 노려봤다. 마이클은 혀를 날름날름해 댔다. “어쭈, 때리려고? 어디 때려봐. 어서.” [어휴, 이 자식을.] 이때, 김미영이 다가왔다. “무슨 일이세요?” 김미영이 되묻자 마이클은 어색하게 미소를 지었다. “아, 아무것도 아니에요.” 아무것도 아니긴. 네가 지금 나 꼬집었잖아! 나는 옹알거렸다. “성국이는 아무것도 아닌 일에 화를 내지 않는 아이거든요.” 옳은 말씀. 마이클이 잠시 기가 차단 얼굴로 김미영을 쳐다봤다. “애가 뭘 안다고요. 그냥 밥 먹고, 자고, 싸는 게 애잖아요.” “그런 애가 무명인 당신들 얼굴 알려주고, 각종 광고까지 하게 해줬는데. 그럼 마이클 님은 그런 애보다 못한 거 아닌가요?” 마이클은 말문이 막혔다. 나는 김미영의 듬직한 어깨를 올려다봤다. “뭐래.” 마이클은 씩씩거리며 영어로 몇 마디 중얼거리곤 자리를 떴다. 분명 나나 김미영이 못 알아들을 것이라고 판단해서 내뱉은 영어였다. 통역하자면, 애나 매니저나 둘 다 재수 없네. 뭐, 이런 말이었다. 나는 툴툴 걸어가는 마이클의 뒤통수를 쳐다봤다. [마이클, 너는 내가 꼭 기억한다. 앞으로 조심해라.] 김미영이 씩씩거리는 내 손을 잡았다. “성국아, 화내지 마. 세상엔 화낼 가치가 없는 사람도 있어. 그런 사람은 철저하게 무시를 해주면 되는 거야.” [어라?] 그 순간, 나는 김미영을 다시 봤다. 김미영은 마이클이 어떤 인간인지 한눈에 꿰뚫고 있었다. 그래, 철저한 무시. 그동안 나는 마이클이 날 놀리면 약이 올라 바동거렸다. 그 덕분에 나와 마이클의 관계는 앙숙이 되어서 프로그램의 메인이 됐다. 앞으로 내가 마이클을 무시하거나 반응해주지 않으면 그는 카메라에서 자연스레 멀어질 게 뻔했다. [애가 되더니, 내가 그동안 너무 감정적이었군.] 나는 통통한 팔을 최대한 끌어당겨 턱을 매만졌다. 쓰레기를 버리고 온 엄마가 나를 안아 들었다. “마이클 씨가 봐주기로 했는데, 어디 가셨어요?” “성국이 엄마, 앞으로 마이클한테는 안 맡기는 게 좋을 것 같아요.” “왜요? 성국이한테 무슨 해코지라도 했나요?” 엄마는 놀란 얼굴로 나를 꼭 안았다. “마이클 씨도 아직 애잖아요.” 김미영은 융통성 있게 말도 돌렸다. 엄마에게 걱정을 끼치지 않고 싶어 하는 게 보였다. 나는 엄마의 옷깃을 꼭 쥐었다. [엄마, 걱정 마. 마이클은 내가 나중에 제대로 손봐줄 거니까.] 이때, ‘저스트’ 숙소의 전등이 일제히 꺼졌다. 뭐지? 어둠에 눈이 익숙해지는 동안, 한동안 눈앞은 칠흑처럼 어두웠다. 엄마는 나를 꼭 안고는 속삭였다. “성국아, 괜찮아. 엄마가 있어.” 나는 그런 엄마 품에 파고들었다. 걱정 따위 되지 않았다. 엄마가 있으니까. 곧 플래시를 든 범선이 다가왔다. “성국이 괜찮죠?” “네, 괜찮아요.” “저 따라오세요. 저희 숙소가 반지하라 플래시 준비해 뒀거든요.” 평소에 무뚝뚝한 범선은 사실 프로그램 시작 후에 그렇게 주목받지 못했다. 하지만 촬영장에 있으면 범선이 언제나 묵묵히 뒤에서 모든 일을 도맡아 한다는 것쯤은 알았다. “계단 조심하세요.” 범선은 일일이 계단을 플래시로 비추었다. “정전이 자주 있나 봐요?” 김미영이 물었다. “자주는 아닌데. 이 근처가 워낙 공사를 많이 하거든요. 종종 전선 건드려서 정전이 일어나긴 해요.” 범선의 도움으로 우리는 무사히 반지하 저스트 숙소를 빠져나왔다. 스태프가 다급한 얼굴로 다가왔다. “어쩌죠? 한전에 연락했더니 복구하는 데 몇 시간 걸린다네요. 아무래도 오늘은 촬영 접어야 할 것 같아요.” “어쩔 수 없죠. 그럼 저희는 성국이랑 집에 갈게요.” “네, 오늘은 우선 푹 쉬시고 내일 오전에 일정 나오는 대로 연락드릴게요.” 스태프는 꾸벅 인사를 하고 사라졌다. 엄마는 걱정스러운 얼굴로 범선을 쳐다봤다. “범선 씨랑 멤버들은 어쩌실 거예요?” “저희야 플래시도 있고, 초도 있어요. 걱정 마세요.” 범선은 배시시 웃었다. 엄마와 김미영 모두 그 모습을 넋 놓고 바라봤다. 역시 범선은 여자들에게 인기 있을 만한 놈이었다.","completion":"Episode 12 Inside the taxi on the way home, the radio was broadcasting traffic information. It seemed like there was quite a bit of congestion. My mom briefly loosened the baby carrier and placed my hand on her swollen belly. \\"Seong-guk, your sibling is playing inside mom's belly right now.\\" I could really feel something poking up against the belly. At Samjeon Group, the birth of a sibling was not a joyous occasion. It meant the birth of a competitor. Just looking at my father's siblings, it was often the case that their relationship was worse than that of strangers. I coldly removed my hand from my mom's belly. [Competitor, huh...] Mom gazed at Kim Mi-young, who was sitting next to us. Since leaving Shinseong Planning, the woman with the bob cut hadn't said a single word. Mom sneakily glanced at Kim Mi-young. \\"Do you have something to say to me?\\" \\"There is, but...\\" Kim Mi-young held back her words. Then, mom suddenly grabbed Kim Mi-young's hand. \\"Sister, would you like to try being Seong-guk's manager?\\" I had just been thinking about it too. She was a woman who had made it to the position of chief in the accounting department at Samjeon Planning, and she was also the last high school graduate employee there. With that kind of perseverance, she passed as my manager. I patted my mom's belly twice as a sign of approval. Pat, pat. I quickly looked at Kim Mi-young. [Bob cut, I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse.] At that moment, mom patted my belly. \\"Seong-guk, be quiet for a moment.\\" [Che. Can't be helped.] I closed my mouth, crossed my arms, and glared fiercely at Kim Mi-young. Kim Mi-young, after looking back and forth between me and my mom, slowly opened her mouth. \\"I was actually going to say that first. Room 107 beat me to it.\\" [Kim Mi-young, what did you just say? You're really going to do it?] Both I and my mom were surprised. \\"Sister, were you thinking about it too?\\" Nod. Kim Mi-young nodded briefly. \\"But... what about your company?\\" \\"I'm planning to quit. Being an unmarried woman in her late thirties, the company doesn't welcome me anyway. I was going to prepare for starting my own business with the money I've saved... but I briefly imagined managing Seong-guk.\\" The woman with the bob cut continued calmly. \\"Of course, the contract conditions will be better than Shinseong Planning, and since I have experience working in the accounting department, I'll handle the money matters cleanly. I've seen a lot about how managers work and manage things at Samjeon Planning.\\" Kim Mi-young had already thought about everything from the contract conditions to her appeal. [Bob cut, you had a plan all along.] I fiercely grabbed the hem of my mom's dress. A person like bob cut would be a great stepping stone for me to become a conglomerate. [Mom, let's write the contract!] As if mom understood what I was saying, she nodded with determination. \\"Sister, I'll speak frankly.\\" \\"Feel free to speak. It's okay to refuse.\\" Kim Mi-young's voice was still calm. \\"Sister, Seong-guk is still young, and although we're poor, I don't want to make him a celebrity if it means seeing him struggle. I've looked into it since the due date is not far off. He might not continue after this job.\\" \\"Then it's even better. If he gets tied to such a company, it's a minimum of 10 years. If Seong-guk decides to quit, we'll terminate the contract then.\\" \\"Sister...\\" \\"Since I also want to start something new, you don't have to thank or feel sorry for me. Of course, I'll receive compensation for my work.\\" It seemed like there couldn't be a better condition. I tugged at my mom's clothes again. [Let's work together, mom.] \\"Sister... I know it's shameless, but could you please help me by being Seong-guk's manager?\\" \\"Of course.\\" Bob cut answered with confidence. I rested my arms on my belly and gazed intently at Kim Mi-young. [Kim Mi-young, I'll be watching, so you better do well.] \\"You're quite the chatterbox. I look forward to working with you, Seong-guk.\\" Kim Mi-young spoke firmly. Our mom and dad, although born orphans and grew up lonely without proper education, were surely blessed with human connections from heaven. To meet a sharp landlord and then a prepared conglomerate like me... I hugged my mom tightly. Although my mom's swollen belly was in the way, the sibling inside was also born under a lucky star. Because I, Jeon Seong-guk, will raise this family. I patted my mom's belly. [Sibling, you're at least reserved for a 14K gold spoon.] * * * \\"The Five Men and a Baby Basket surpassed 25% viewership last week! We've prepared a company dinner after today's shoot, so please attend.\\" The manager of 'Just' shouted loudly. Thanks to the popularity of The Five Men and a Baby Basket, 'Just,' one of the many rookie groups, also saw a rapid rise in popularity. \\"Alright, everyone attend since the company is paying. Let's start shooting!\\" With the director's word, the surroundings quieted down again. The handsome man playing the mom role, Jae-hyun, picked me up. Then, Michael came out of the kitchen with a banana in his mouth, causing Jae-hyun to panic. \\"Michael, that's Seong-guk's. What if you eat it!\\" \\"I have a mouth too, don't I? I'm starving to death.\\" \\"Ah, really. When will you grow up?\\" Jae-hyun scolded Michael, but Michael stuck out his tongue at me, making a face. I responded by flailing my arms and legs as if I was about to hit him. Unexpectedly, the antagonistic relationship between Michael and me received immense love in the dynamics of the 'Just' five members. During the first night of shooting, the scene where Michael tried to sprinkle hot sauce on my baby food or tormented me all night was edited to show his innocent, childlike charm. Moreover, the caption 'The youngest who hasn't grown up seems jealous of the new sibling.' turned Michael into a brother who seemed to have all his love stolen by the youngest. It was truly devilish editing. Various forums compared mine and Michael's relationship to Tom and Jerry. Now, Michael fully embraced his childish side. People even started calling Michael and me 'The Kiddos.' Now, it was time for Taehyung, playing the dad role, to step in and wrap up today's episode. \\"Michael, stop! Jae-hyun, Seong-guk's face doesn't look good. Check his diaper.\\" \\"Oh, brother.\\" [What, do I have to expose my bottom again?] Even though it was blurred out, Taehyung's way of wrapping up episodes was always either changing diapers or feeding milk, something very primal. Jae-hyun quickly took off my pants. Soon, my lower half felt cool. \\"Seong-guk hasn't peed yet.\\" The camera suddenly zoomed in on me. [Should I give them a proper pee show then?] I grimaced with all my might and aimed at the camera. [Ready... Fire!] \\"Cut!\\" As soon as the director's voice was heard, the staff burst into laughter. The director's voice was excited. \\"Today's a total hit. How did you time your pee so perfectly? Isn't our Seong-guk a genius? This episode's ratings will surely rise. We might even surpass 30%. Alright, let's take a 30-minute break and then resume shooting.\\" The director continued to praise me. The shooting staff also spared no compliments. [This attention and cheers. Not much different from my previous life.] I basked in everyone's attention. Mom quickly came over, dressed me, and handed me a banana. I chewed on the soft banana with my front teeth. \\"Seong-guk, are you not tired?\\" [Mom, making money is always hard. This is nothing. When I was the vice chairman of Samjeon Group, I was so stressed I even got alopecia areata.] Mom patted my bottom and then asked a staff member to watch me. \\"I'll throw away the trash. Please watch Seong-guk.\\" \\"Sure, don't worry and go.\\" I sat comfortably in a freshly changed diaper. [This diaper is decent. Money is indeed good.] I had suffered quite a bit from wearing ill-fitting diapers, causing skin abrasions. After switching to more expensive diapers, the rash stopped occurring. Then, Michael approached and poked me lightly. \\"Kid, you were really about to hit me with your foot earlier, weren't you?\\" [Is this guy challenging me?] Michael, despite his annoying appearance, had an even worse personality. I turned my head away sharply. Ignoring such things is beneficial for one's character. \\"Hey, are you ignoring me now?\\" [Really, he's making a big deal out of everything.] \\"What are you mumbling about! Do my words sound like nonsense to you?\\" I covered my ears with both hands. [I can't hear you. I can't hear you.] Michael's face showed he was getting a rise out of it. Suddenly, my waist stung. Michael was pinching the flesh on my waist with his fingers. [Did you just dare pinch Jeon Seong-guk? Huh?!] I quickly assumed a battle stance. Such a guy needed to be thoroughly trampled so he wouldn't dare to rise again. I clenched my fist and glared at Michael. Michael flicked his tongue teasingly. \\"Oh, trying to hit me? Go ahead, try.\\" [Oh, this guy.] Just then, Kim Mi-young approached. \\"What's going on?\\" As Kim Mi-young asked, Michael awkwardly smiled. \\"Oh, it's nothing.\\" Nothing? You just pinched me! I babbled in protest. \\"Seong-guk is a child who doesn't get angry over trivial matters.\\" Right on. Michael looked at Kim Mi-young with a stunned expression for a moment. \\"A child knows what? They just eat, sleep, and poop.\\" \\"Yet, that child made you unknowns famous and even got you various commercials. So, doesn't that make you, Mr. Michael, worse than such a child?\\" Michael was at a loss for words. I looked up at Kim Mi-young's reliable shoulder. \\"What are you saying.\\" Michael grumbled and left, muttering a few words in English, probably thinking Kim Mi-young and I wouldn't understand. Translated, it was something like, \\"Both the kid and the manager are annoying.\\" I watched Michael's retreating back. [Michael, I'll remember this. Be careful.] Kim Mi-young held my hand, which was still fuming. \\"Seong-guk, don't be angry. There are people in the world not worth your anger. Such people should be thoroughly ignored.\\" [Oh?] At that moment, I looked at Kim Mi-young again. Kim Mi-young saw right through what kind of person Michael was. Right, thorough ignorance. Until now, whenever Michael teased me, I got worked up, which made our antagonistic relationship the main feature of the program. If I start ignoring Michael or not reacting to him, he would naturally fade from the camera's focus. [I've become too emotional since becoming a baby.] I stretched my chubby arms as far as they could go and stroked my chin. Mom, who had gone to throw away the trash, picked me up. \\"Michael was supposed to watch you, where did he go?\\" \\"Mom, it's better not to leave Seong-guk with Michael in the future.\\" \\"Why? Did he do something to Seong-guk?\\" Mom hugged me tightly, looking alarmed. \\"Michael is still a child.\\" Kim Mi-young smoothly diverted the conversation. She didn't want to worry mom. I clutched my mom's collar. [Mom, don't worry. I'll take care of Michael later.] Just then, the lights in the 'Just' dormitory went out all at once. What's happening? As my eyes adjusted to the darkness, everything was pitch black for a while. Mom hugged me tightly and whispered. \\"Seong-guk, it's okay. Mom is here.\\" I snuggled into my mom's embrace. I wasn't worried. Because mom was here. Soon, Beom-seon approached with a flashlight. \\"Is Seong-guk okay?\\" \\"Yes, we're fine.\\" \\"Follow me. Our dorm is a semi-basement, so we have flashlights prepared.\\" Beom-seon, who usually seemed stoic, hadn't received much attention since the program started. However, I knew that Beom-seon always silently took care of everything behind the scenes on set. \\"Be careful on the stairs.\\" Beom-seon carefully illuminated each step with his flashlight. \\"Is there often a power outage?\\" Kim Mi-young asked. \\"Not often, but there's a lot of construction around here. Sometimes they mess with the power lines, causing outages.\\" With Beom-seon's help, we safely exited the semi-basement dorm of 'Just.' A staff member approached with a worried face. \\"What should we do? I contacted the power company, and they said it would take a few hours to restore power. It seems we have to cancel today's shoot.\\" \\"It can't be helped. We'll take Seong-guk home for today.\\" \\"Yes, please rest well for today, and I'll contact you with the schedule for tomorrow morning.\\" The staff bowed and left. Mom looked at Beom-seon with a worried face. \\"What about Beom-seon and the other members?\\" \\"We have flashlights and candles, so don't worry.\\" Beom-seon smiled broadly. Both mom and Kim Mi-young stared at him, mesmerized. Indeed, Beom-seon was the type to be popular among women."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Нужна помощь, сложилась такая ситуация: хочу сделать ссылку, которая отправит на определенный участок страницы тег <a name=\\"...\\"></a> устарел, а id можно использовать лишь раз, что делать?","completion":"Привет! Если тебе нужно создать ссылку, которая будет перенаправлять на определенный участок на странице, и ты знаешь, что использование \`<a name=\\"...\\"></a>\` устарело, а \`id\` можно присвоить только один раз каждому элементу, лучшим решением будет использование атрибута \`id\` в сочетании с тэгами, определяющими структуру документа или с другими элементами, допускающими его использование. Вот базовый пример того, как это может быть реализовано: 1. **Определи раздел для перехода**. Установи атрибут \`id\` элементу, к которому ты хочешь создать якорную ссылку. Это может быть любой элемент, например, \`div\`, \`section\`, \`header\`, \`footer\` и т.д. \`\`\`html <h2 id=\\"specific-section\\">Заголовок определенного раздела</h2> <p>Какой-то текст под заголовком</p> \`\`\` 2. **Создай ссылку на этот раздел**. Для этого необходимо использовать элемент \`<a>\` с атрибутом \`href\`, в значение которого вставляется \`#\` и \`id\` целевого элемента. \`\`\`html <a href=\\"#specific-section\\">Перейти к определенному разделу</a> \`\`\` Таким образом, когда пользователь нажимает на ссылку, он будет перенаправлен к элементу с указанным \`id\`. Пример полной страницы: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\\"ru\\"> <head> <meta charset=\\"UTF-8\\"> <title>Пример страницы</title> </head> <body> <a href=\\"#specific-section\\">Перейти к определенному разделу</a> <div style=\\"height: 1000px;\\">Просто большой отступ, чтобы эффект был заметен</div> <h2 id=\\"specific-section\\">Заголовок определенного раздела</h2> <p>Какой-то текст под заголовком. Теперь можно легко перейти прямо сюда с верха страницы.</p> </body> </html> \`\`\` Важно помнить, что \`id\` должен быть уникальным на всей странице, чтобы избежать конфликтов и ошибок в работе документа."},{"prompt":"Но у меня таких переходов несколько, а использовать id несколько раз - семантически неверно","completion":"Понял твою ситуацию. Если у тебя несколько ссылок на различные участки одной и той же страницы и ты хочешь использовать их корректно, сохраняя при этом валидный HTML, тебе нужно задать уникальные \`id\` для каждого целевого участка страницы. Несмотря на то что \`id\` должен быть уникальным на всей странице, ты можешь создать столько уникальных идентификаторов, сколько тебе нужно. # Пример с множественными переходами: HTML: \`\`\`html <body> <!-- Ссылки для перехода --> <nav> <ul> <li><a href=\\"#section1\\">Раздел 1</a></li> <li><a href=\\"#section2\\">Раздел 2</a></li> <li><a href=\\"#section3\\">Раздел 3</a></li> </ul> </nav> <!-- Содержимое для перехода --> <section id=\\"section1\\"> <h2>Заголовок Раздела 1</h2> <p>Некоторый текст в разделе 1...</p> </section> <section id=\\"section2\\"> <h2>Заголовок Раздела 2</h2> <p>Некоторый текст в разделе 2...</p> </section> <section id=\\"section3\\"> <h2>Заголовок Раздела 3</h2> <p>Некоторый текст в разделе 3...</p> </section> </body> \`\`\` В этом примере каждая ссылка \`<a href=\\"#...\\">\` указывает на разные участки страницы с помощью уникального \`id\`. Таким образом, семантика сохраняется, так как каждый \`id\` уникален и указывает на конкретный раздел страницы. При этом подходе ты можешь создавать сколько угодно якорных ссылок, ведущих на разные участки страницы, сохраняя при этом корректность и валидность кода. Главное условие — соблюдать уникальность каждого \`id\`."},{"prompt":"То есть, семантически неправильно указывать несколько раз один и тот же id (имею в виду с одним и тем же названием)?","completion":"Да, ты полностью прав. Согласно стандартам HTML, атрибут \`id\` должен быть уникальным в пределах всей страницы. Это означает, что каждый \`id\` должен использоваться только один раз на странице и не должен повторяться. Назначение \`id\` — идентифицировать один конкретный элемент в документе, что позволяет стилизовать его через CSS или обращаться к нему через JavaScript. Дублирование \`id\` ведёт к неоднозначности, что может привести к ошибкам как в оформлении страницы (CSS не будет корректно применять стили, так как ожидается уникальность идентификатора), так и в её функциональности (JavaScript может работать не так, как ожидается, потому что \`document.getElementById\` вернёт первый попавшийся элемент с данным \`id\`, игнорируя остальные). Поэтому, используя \`id\`, следует удостовериться, что каждый из них уникален на странице. В случаях, когда нужно группировать элементы или ссылаться на множество элементов, следует использовать \`class\`, который допускает повторение в пределах страницы."},{"prompt":"А если на странице два id, но у них разные названия - будет ли это семантически верно? (при условии нынешней версии html и css)","completion":"Да, это абсолютно верно и семантически корректно в рамках нынешних версий HTML и CSS. На самом деле, это именно то, как и предполагается использовать атрибут \`id\`. Каждый элемент на вашей странице может иметь свой уникальный \`id\`, позволяя таким образом ссылаться на него или стилизовать его индивидуально. Правила использования \`id\` просты: - Каждый \`id\` должен быть уникален в пределах страницы. - Не должно быть двух элементов с одинаковым \`id\` на одной и той же странице. Так что если у вас на странице есть элементы с \`id=\\"header\\"\` и \`id=\\"footer\\"\`, это совершенно нормально и соответствует текущим стандартам разметки и стилизации. \`\`\`html <div id=\\"header\\"> <!-- Контент шапки --> </div> <div id=\\"content\\"> <!-- Основной контент --> </div> <div id=\\"footer\\"> <!-- Контент подвала --> </div> \`\`\` В приведенном выше примере каждый из \`div\` имеет свой уникальный \`id\`, что позволяет точечно обращаться к каждому из них в CSS и JavaScript, например: \`\`\`css #header { background-color: navy; color: white; } #footer { background-color: grey; color: black; } \`\`\` Такой подход позволяет не только улучшить структурированность и доступность вашей веб-страницы, но и обеспечивает более гибкое и мощное управление стилями и скриптами."},{"prompt":"Спасибо большое, помог прояснить ситуацию","completion":"Пожалуйста, рад был помочь!

В HTML и SVG (когда он встроен в HTML-документ) желательно использовать названия тегов в нижнем регистре, чтобы соответствовать стандартам и обеспечить совместимость с различными инструментами и браузерами. Ошибка указывает на элемент \`clipPath\`, который используется в твоем SVG. В твоем случае, чтобы устранить эту ошибку, достаточно просто переименовать элемент в нижний регистр: Из: \`\`\`html <clipPath> <!-- содержимое --> </clipPath> \`\`\` В: \`\`\`html <clippath> <!-- содержимое --> </clippath> \`\`\` Исправление всех названий тегов на нижний регистр должно устранить указанную ошибку в HTMLhint. В целом, при встраивании SVG в HTML-документы рекомендуется придерживаться следующих правил для обеспечения лучшей совместимости и избежания подобных проблем: - Использовать нижний регистр для названий тегов и атрибутов. - Закрывать все одиночные теги (например, \`<path />\`). - Всегда указывать значения атрибутов в кавычках (например, \`fill=\\"red\\"\`). Если в твоем SVG много элементов и исправлять вручную может быть сложно, можно воспользоваться онлайн-инструментами для минификации и форматирования SVG, которые автоматически преобразуют теги и атрибуты в нижний регистр."},{"prompt":"The character U+041e \\"О\\" could be confused with the ASCII character U+004f \\"O\\", which is more common in source code. Adjust settings Как исправить?","completion":"Сообщение об ошибке, с которым вы столкнулись, указывает на проблему, связанную с использованием символов, визуально похожих, но имеющих различные кодовые точки в Unicode. В вашем случае, русская буква \\"О\\" (U+041E) может быть визуально путана с латинской буквой \\"O\\" (U+004F), что может вызвать путаницу или даже проблемы с кодом, особенно, если эти символы используются в контексте, где ожидается строгое различие (например, в идентификаторах, ключах, именах переменных и т.д.). Чтобы исправить эту проблему, вы должны определить, где в вашем коде используется русская \\"О\\", и заменить её на латинскую \\"O\\", если контекст подразумевает использование символов латиницы. В большинстве редакторов кода и сред разработки вы можете воспользоваться функцией поиска (обычно вызываемой комбинацией \`Ctrl+F\` или \`Cmd+F\` на macOS), чтобы найти использование неправильного символа. К сожалению, визуально отличить эти символы может быть сложно, поэтому важно быть внимательным при такой проверке или воспользоваться специализированными инструментами и скриптами, способными автоматически обнаружить и предложить исправление для подобных случаев. Если проверка и замена символов производится в большом объеме кода или текста, можно рассмотреть возможность использования скриптов на Python или других утилит, способных автоматически определить и заменить символы на основе их Unicode-кода. Пример простого скрипта на Python для замены \\"О\\" (U+041E) на \\"O\\" (U+004F) в текстовом файле: \`\`\`python with open('source.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file: text = file.read() # Замена русской \\"О\\" на латинскую \\"O\\" text = text.replace('u041e', 'O') with open('fixed.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file: file.write(text) \`\`\` Учтите, что такой подход следует применять осторожно, удостоверившись, что замена символов не нарушит смысл или функциональность вашего кода или текста."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Neural Coder is a novel component under Intel® Neural Compressor to further simplify the deployment of deep learning models via one-click automated code changes for device switch (e.g., CUDA to CPU) and optimization enabling. Subsequently, Neural Coder can also perform automated benchmark on all applicable optimization sets acquired from the automated enabling, and evaluate for the best out-of-box performance. Neural Coder leverages static program analysis techniques and heuristic optimization rules to simplify the usage of various Deep Learning optimization APIs for increasing computation efficiency of AI models and improving user experience for general AI customers. We demonstrate great improvement of developer productivity and aim to facilitate enhanced Deep Learning acceleration adoption via this toolkit. Neural Coder helps you code Deep Learning optimizations automatically into your scripts. For example, to apply Automatic Mixed Precision (torch.cpu.amp.autocast) JIT Script computation graph transformation (torch.jit.script) Channels Last memory format transformation (torch.channels_last) simultaneously on below PyTorch evaluation code, we generate the optimized code in one-click by detecting the correct position to insert the correct API code lines: import torch import torchvision.models as models my_model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True) + import torch + with torch.no_grad(): + my_model = my_model.to(memory_format=torch.channels_last) + import torch + with torch.no_grad(): + my_model.eval() + my_model = torch.jit.script(my_model) + my_model = torch.jit.freeze(my_model) my_model.eval() batch_size = 112 input = torch.rand(batch_size, 3, 224, 224) with torch.no_grad(): + import torch + with torch.cpu.amp.autocast(enabled=True, dtype=torch.bfloat16): my_model(input) Getting Started! There are currently 3 ways to use Neural Coder for automatic quantization enabling and benchmark. Jupyter Lab Extension We offer Neural Coder as an extension plugin in Jupyter Lab. This enables users to utilize Neural Coder while writing their Deep Learning models in Jupyter Lab coding platform. Users can simply search for jupyter-lab-neural-compressor in the Extension Manager in JupyterLab and install Neural Coder with one click. For more details, please refer to this guide. AWS Amazon SageMaker users can also use Neural Coder as an extension following this guide. Python Launcher Neural Coder can be used as a Python Launcher. Users can run the Python Deep Learning model code as it is with automatic enabling of optimizations by simply adding an inline prefix -m neural_coder to the Python command line. For more details, please refer to this guide. Python API There are 3 user-facing APIs for Neural Coder: enable, bench and superbench. For more details, please refer to this guide.

Imagine you're an artist, and you've been painting with oils on canvas, which is a bit slow and takes a lot of effort. But then, someone hands you a set of super tools—brushes that paint faster, colors that dry quicker, and tools that make your painting look even more magnificent. These tools make the whole painting process quicker and more efficient, allowing you to produce more artwork in less time and with fewer resources. That's essentially what **Neural Coder** does, but instead of art, we're talking about making computer programs run faster and more efficiently, particularly those dealing with AI (Artificial Intelligence). **Neural Coder** is a tool created by Intel to help people who are developing AI models. It simplifies the process of making these AI models run faster on different devices, whether they're using a GPU (a powerful component for processing graphics and complex calculations) or a CPU (the main processor in a computer). It’s like having an assistant who automatically adjusts your AI model's code so it can work better and faster on whatever computer it's running on, without you needing to dig into the nitty-gritty. For example, if you wrote an AI program that works really well on a specific type of computer but you want it to run on a more common setup without any fancy hardware, **Neural Coder** can automatically rewrite parts of your program to make that possible. It does so by applying some smart changes: 1. **Automatic Mixed Precision**: This adjusts how the computer handles numbers to make calculations faster while still being accurate enough for your needs. 2. **JIT Script**: This optimizes how the AI model's instructions are processed, making them run faster by translating them into a form that the computer can execute more quickly. 3. **Channels Last memory format**: This changes how data is organized in memory, helping the computer process it more efficiently. Intel gives an example where you have a program for evaluating AI models. With just one click, **Neural Coder** can insert special commands into your program that apply these optimizations, making your AI work faster without you having to figure out how to do all of that manually. **Getting Started with Neural Coder**: There are a few ways to use this tool: - **Jupyter Lab Extension**: Think of Jupyter Lab as a digital notebook that data scientists and researchers use to write and test their code. Neural Coder can be added as a plugin here, making it super easy to speed up AI models right within your digital notebook. - **AWS Amazon SageMaker Extension**: If you're using Amazon's cloud to develop and run your AI models, you can also use Neural Coder as an add-on tool here. - **Python Launcher**: By adding a small piece of code when you run your AI model code, Neural Coder can automatically optimize it for you. - **Python API**: For those who are comfortable tinkering with their code, Neural Coder offers specific commands you can use to enable optimizations manually. If you have any questions or need assistance with Neural Coder, Intel has provided a contact email where you can reach out for support."},{"prompt":"what is the benefit of using Jupyter over vs code according to this info on their website? : \\"\\"Jupyter Home TryInstallGet InvolvedDocumentationNewsSocialGovernanceSecurityAbout circle of programming language iconscircle of programming language iconscircle of programming language iconsjupyter logowhite background Free software, open standards, and web services for interactive computing across all programming languages examples of jupyterlab workspaces in single document and multiple document workspaces JupyterLab: A Next-Generation Notebook Interface JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data.

While numerous nutrients play critical roles in plant health, the three main elements to focus on are Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). Based on their importance during the tillering stage, here's a rating for each from 0 to 10: 1. **Nitrogen (N): 9/10** - **Why?** Nitrogen is crucial for the growth of green leafy parts of the plant and is directly involved in photosynthesis. During the tillering stage, sufficient nitrogen is essential for promoting the development of new tillers, ensuring robust growth. However, it's important not to overapply, as excessive nitrogen can lead to lush growth at the expense of root development, making the plants more susceptible to lodging and disease. 2. **Phosphorus (P): 8/10** - **Why?** Phosphorus plays a pivotal role in energy transfer within the plant, root development, and the overall growth rate. During tillering, phosphorus supports the development of strong root systems, which is imperative for supporting the plant both physically and nutritionally. Insufficient phosphorus can lead to stunted growth and reduced tillering, impacting overall yield potential. 3. **Potassium (K): 7/10** - **Why?** Potassium is important for the regulation of water use (through the opening and closing of stomata), enzyme activation, and disease resistance. During the tillering stage, adequate potassium helps in increasing photosynthetic rates and improving drought resistance. Potassium deficiency might not show immediate dramatic effects on growth like nitrogen or phosphorus might, but over time, it affects the plant's overall health, vigor, and resistance to stresses. These ratings are somewhat relative and may need adjustment based on the specific conditions of your soil and the variety of rice you are growing. It's always best practice to conduct a soil test and even a plant tissue test if possible to determine the precise nutrient needs of your crop. This ensures that applications of fertilizer are both economically and ecologically sound, avoiding over- or under-application of nutrients."},{"prompt":"is Amino acid good for rice plant?","completion":"Yes, amino acids can be beneficial for rice plants, as well as for many other types of crops. Amino acids serve as building blocks for proteins and play crucial roles in various physiological and metabolic processes in plants. Here are some of the ways amino acids can benefit rice plants: 1. **Enhanced Nutrient Absorption**: Amino acids can help improve the absorption of nutrients by acting as natural chelators, binding to nutrients and making them more available to the plant. This can be especially useful in the uptake of micronutrients, which are essential for plant growth but needed only in small quantities. 2. **Stress Tolerance**: Applying amino acids to rice plants can enhance their ability to withstand stress conditions such as drought, salinity, and extreme temperatures. Certain amino acids function as osmolytes, helping plants maintain cellular function under stress by stabilizing proteins and membrane integrity. 3. **Growth and Development**: Some amino acids are known to stimulate plant growth hormones or act directly as growth-promoting substances, encouraging plant growth and development. For example, they can promote root development, which is crucial for nutrient and water uptake. 4. **Improved Photosynthesis**: Amino acids can contribute to more efficient photosynthesis by supporting the structure and function of chloroplasts, where photosynthesis occurs. This can lead to better growth and higher yields. 5. **Enhances Resistance to Pests and Diseases**: Some amino acids can boost the plant's innate immune response, preparing it to better resist attacks from pests and diseases. When using amino acids as a supplement for rice plants, it's important to apply them according to product recommendations and consider the specific needs of the plants. Amino acid supplements are available in various forms, including foliar sprays and soil amendments. Foliar application is a common method, as it allows for rapid absorption by the leaves. However, while amino acids can provide benefits, they should be part of a comprehensive nutrient management plan that considers all essential macro- and micronutrients required by the rice plants. Over-reliance on any single type of input can lead to imbalances and potentially reduce plant health and yield."},{"prompt":"چیزی در مورد سم پردوفیکس میدونی؟","completion":"پردوفیکس (Pardofix) یک نوع سم و ضدعفونی‌کننده قوی است که برای کنترل انواع میکروارگانیسم‌ها از جمله باکتری‌ها، ویروس‌ها، قارچ‌ها و اسپورها استفاده می‌شود. این ماده به طور گسترده‌ای در صنایع مختلفی مانند کشاورزی، دامپروری، آبزی‌پروری، صنایع غذایی و حتی در بیمارستان‌ها و مراکز بهداشتی برای ضدعفونی کردن سطوح، تجهیزات و آب استفاده می‌شود. مکانیسم عملکرد پردوفیکس بر پایه اکسیداسیون قوی میکروارگانیسم‌ها است، به این معنی که این ماده با ایجاد واکنش‌های اکسیداتیو، ساختار سلولی میکروارگانیسم‌ها را تخریب کرده و منجر به مرگ آن‌ها می‌شود. این ویژگی باعث می‌شود پردوفیکس یک انتخاب مؤثر برای ضدعفونی و ایمن‌سازی محیط‌های مختلف باشد. استفاده از پردوفیکس باید با دقت و طبق دستورالعمل‌های تولیدکننده انجام شود، زیرا مانند هر ماده شیمیایی قوی دیگری، می‌تواند در صورت استفاده نادرست خطراتی برای سلامتی انسان و محیط زیست داشته باشد. اطمینان از استفاده صحیح و ایمن از این ماده، از جمله رعایت میزان مصرف توصیه شده و استفاده از تجهیزات حفاظتی مناسب، بسیار مهم است. در کشاورزی، استفاده از پردوفیکس می‌تواند به عنوان بخشی از برنامه مدیریت آفات و بیماری‌ها برای حفاظت از محصولات و افزایش بهره‌وری مورد استفاده قرار گیرد. با این حال، همیشه توصیه می‌شود که قبل از استفاده از هر نوع ماده شیمیایی در کشاورزی، با متخصصان و مشاوران کشاورزی مشورت شود تا از انتخاب و استفاده صحیح و ایمن اطمینان حاصل شود."},{"prompt":"میتونم از پردوفیکس به عنوان قارچکش استفاده کنم؟","completion":"بله، پردوفیکس به دلیل خواص ضدعفونی‌کننده و اکسیدکننده قوی که دارد، می‌تواند در کنترل قارچ‌ها و اسپورهای قارچی موثر باشد و به عنوان قارچکش استفاده شود. این محصول می‌تواند در محیط‌های کشاورزی برای پیشگیری و کنترل بیماری‌های ناشی از قارچ‌ها به کار رود. با این حال، چند نکته مهم وجود دارد که باید در نظر گرفته شود: 1. **دوز و روش استفاده**: میزان و نحوه استفاده از پردوفیکس باید طبق دستورالعمل‌های تولیدکننده و با توجه به نوع بیماری قارچی و شرایط محیطی انجام شود. استفاده بیش از حد یا نادرست می‌تواند به گیاهان آسیب برساند یا موجب مقاومت در میکروارگانیسم‌ها شود. 2. **احتیاطات ایمنی**: هنگام کار با پردوفیکس و سایر مواد شیمیایی، استفاده از تجهیزات حفاظت فردی مانند دستکش، عینک ایمنی و ماسک توصیه می‌شود تا از تماس مستقیم با پوست و تنفس آن جلوگیری شود. 3. **مدیریت محیط زیست**: باید مراقب بود تا استفاده از پردوفیکس و سایر مواد شیمیایی به محیط زیست آسیب نرساند. این شامل جلوگیری از آلودگی آب‌های سطحی و زیرزمینی و حفاظت از حیات وحش می‌شود. 4. **مشاوره با متخصصان**: قبل از استفاده از پردوفیکس به عنوان قارچکش، توصیه می‌شود با متخصصان کشاورزی یا مشاوران بیماری‌های گیاهی مشورت کنید تا اطمینان حاصل شود که این روش درمانی برای مشکل خاص شما مناسب است و به بهترین نحو اجرا می‌شود. در نهایت، در حالی که پردوفیکس می‌تواند در کنترل قارچ‌ها موثر باشد، همیشه بهتر است که استراتژی‌های مدیریت آفات و بیماری‌ها را به گونه‌ای طراحی کنید که کمترین تأثیر منفی را بر محیط زیست داشته باشد و از رویکردهای مدیریت آفات یکپارچه (IPM) پیروی کنید."},{"prompt":"are have google search api with summery of page?","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, Google does offer a Custom Search JSON API that allows developers to retrieve web search results programmatically.

[제발 저리 좀 가. 아무리 아빠지만, 남자가 해주는 뽀뽀는 사양할게.] 나는 바동거렸지만, 아빠는 그럴수록 더 세게 나를 껴안았다. 이 상황을 벗어나야 했다. 나는 얼른 유리창에 손을 딱 대고는 기다리고 기다린 동생의 탄생 앞에 감격한 형의 얼굴을 연기했다. “밍구기. 헤.” 그러곤 해맑게 웃었다. “촬영 그만!” 감독의 목소리가 뒤에서 들렸다. “야, 이거 완전 대박이야. 초대박. 이거 나가면 분명 시청률 또 오른다.” 감독은 연신 감탄했다. “감독님, 성국이는 진짜 사람들이 원하는 것을 아는 것 같다니까요. 이것만 내보내도 되겠는데요.” 조연출이 잽싸게 나를 칭찬했다. 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. 으쓱으쓱. 범선이 내 볼을 손가락으로 톡 건드렸다. “성국이 형 되더니 의젓해졌는데.” [난 태어날 때부터 의젓했어.] 간호사가 유리창 너머에서 다시 민국이를 내밀었다. “이제 들어가 봐야 하거든요. 마지막으로 좀 더 보세요.” 나는 아빠 품에 안겨서 핏덩이 민국이를 내려다봤다. 시뻘건 민국이는 눈조차 제대로 뜨지 못했다. 하지만 나는 눈빛으로 경고했다. 이제부터 절대 동생이라도 봐주는 일 따위 없을 것이라는 예고장이었다. “그럼, 들어갈게요.” 간호사는 민국이를 데리고 들어갔다. 스태프들은 철수 준비를 했고, ‘저스트’ 멤버들도 모두 숨을 돌렸다. “성국아, 동생 생겨 좋겠다!” 루카스는 해맑게 장난도 걸었다. [루카스, 자세히 보니 이에 양배추 꼈다고 내가 말 안 했나.] 나를 안고 있던 루카스는 유리창에 비친 자신을 보더니 소스라치게 놀랐다. “뭐야! 나 이에 양배추 꼈잖아.” “그니까 아까 차에서 거울 보라고 했잖아. 졸리다고 자더니. 쯧쯧.” 재현이 혀를 찼다. 루카스가 마이클을 가리키며 웃었다. “마이클, 넌 케찹!” 하지만 마이클은 이번 촬영 내내 아무 말도, 아무 행동도 하지 않았다. 감독의 말 때문이었다. 마이클은 사이사이 몇 번이나 감독에게 가서 사과했지만, 감독은 대답도 않고 촬영만 했다. 감독이 마이클을 휙 지나치더니 다른 멤버들에게 웃으며 말을 건넸다. “다들 정말 자연스럽고 좋았어! 니들은 친근한 이미지로 승부 걸어야지. 자, 오늘은 쉬고 다음 방송 때 보자.” 감독은 웃으며 철저히 마이클을 무시했다. 그리고 아빠에게 다가가 봉투를 내밀었다. “아버님, 오늘 정말 고생 많으셨습니다.” “이게 뭐예요, 감독님?” “출산하셨는데, 제대로 된 선물도 못 준비했네요. 이건 제 개인적으로 드리는 거예요. 참, 병원비는 방송국에서 다 계산했습니다.” “병원비도 계산하셨는데, 괜찮습니다, 감독님.” “받으세요. 안 받으시면 제가 더 서운합니다. 솔직히 출연료야 정해진 거고, 광고 출연도 당분간 못 하잖아요.” 아빠는 어쩔 수 없이 감독이 내민 봉투를 받았다. “정말 감사합니다, 감독님.” “감사는 우리가 해야죠. 성국이 덕분에 시청률 또 오르겠는걸요. 이 녀석 진짜, 뭐 연기를 아는 건지. 어떻게 카메라만 딱 들이대면 우리가 원하는 장면이 딱 나와요? 밍구기. 이 한마디에 제가 모든 시름이 다 사라졌다니까요.” “성국이가 동생 무지 기다렸거든요.” [설마…. 내가?] 감독이 내 볼을 슬그머니 잡았다 놨다. “알았다, 이놈아. 동생 보고 싶었구나. 참, 아버님. 이번에는 이미 촬영한 분량도 있고, 성국이 동생 만나는 장면까지 나가서 다음 촬영 좀 여유 있을 것 같아요.” 나는 감독을 보고는 배시시 웃어줬다. 일종의 아부였다. [앞으로도 잘 부탁해, 감독.] 감독이 미소를 지었다. “성국아, 나 보고 싶어도 울면 안 돼.” “응.” 나는 고개도 끄덕였다. “아이고, 기특한 녀석.” 자본의 세계에서 가장 중요한 것은 누구에게 고개를 숙여야 하는지 빨리 파악하는 것이다. 지금 이 촬영장에서는 감독이 왕이었다. * * * 임선미는 막 샤워를 마치고 나왔다. 전재형이 샤워가운만 걸친 채 소파에서 신문을 보고 있었다. “자기야, 오늘 자고 갈 거야?” “내일 일찍 오찬 모임 있어.” 전재형의 규칙 중 하나는 외도는 해도 외박은 하지 않는다는 거였다. 그건 삼전 그룹 가족들의 불문율이었다. 아무리 바람을 피워도 가족은 지킨다는 신념 때문이었다. 그저 바람 상대로 만나다가 하루 이틀 자다 보면 그게 일주일이 되고, 한 달이 되기도 한다는 것을 누구보다 전재형이 더 잘 알고 있었다. 그렇게 되면 그저 몇 푼이면 해결될 상대가 갑자기 안방을 넘보기 시작하고, 헤어질 때 골치가 아파진다. 임선미는 서운한 표정으로 위스키를 따라 전재형 앞에 내밀었다. “좋아하는 거.” “고마워.” “자기야, 이번에 나 영화 촬영 끝나면 우리 미국이나 다녀올까?” “그래.” 미래는 어찌 될지 몰랐다. 다만 지금 당장 싫다거나 어려울 것 같다는 말을 해서 앞에 있는 여자와 싸우는 건 에너지 소비일 뿐이다. 전재형은 슬슬 임선미가 지겨워지기 시작했다. 임선미를 처음 만난 것은 임선미가 한창 슬럼프를 겪고 있을 때였다. 이미 하이틴 스타로 잘나가다가 성인 연기자로 변신하겠다며 찍은 파격적인 정사 신이 있는 영화가 오히려 역효과를 불러일으켰다. <국민 여동생 임선미의 노출은 아무도 보고 싶지 않다.> 영화도 망하고, 이미지도 망한 임선미는 서서히 대중의 관심에서 멀어졌다. 임선미를 구해준 건 신성중이었다. 하이틴 시절 임선미를 연예인으로 좋아했던 전재형에게 임선미를 소개해준 거였다. 임선미도 전재형의 첫인상이 나쁘지 않았다. 대한민국에서 손꼽히는 재벌. 거기다 큰 키에 잘 관리된 외모는 40대였지만, 중후한 매력까지 있었다. 거기다 전재형과의 관계만 잘만 유지하면 삼전 전자의 전속 모델이 될 수 있는 기회였다. 하이틴 스타로 벌어둔 돈은 아빠와 오빠가 사업한다고 야무지게 말아먹었고, 오히려 빚만 남은 상황이었다. 물론 전재형의 여성 편력은 연예계에서도 유명했다. 잘나가는 배우들 중에 전재형과 엮이지 않은 배우는 찾아보기 힘들다는 이야기도 있었다. 전재형은 신문에 난 삼전 전자의 광고를 보고 있었다. 물론 거기에는 임선미가 있었다. 이번에 새로 출시한 냉장고였다. “선미야, 너 살 좀 찐 거 같은데.” “이번에 맡은 배역이 30대 노처녀 역할이라 살 좀 찌웠거든.” 임선미는 얼마 전부터 전재형이 자신을 보는 눈이 예전과 다르다는 것을 한 번에 알아챘다. 그래서 일부러 그동안 맡아온 도회적인 이미지가 아니라 노처녀 역할도 맡은 거였다. 전재형은 그동안 좋은 발판이었고, 이제 임선미에게도 연기 변화가 필요한 타이밍이었다. 전재형은 살짝 눈썹을 올렸다. “우리 삼전 전자 가전은 젊고 세련된 도시 여자들을 대상으로 하잖아. 결혼을 하고 애를 낳아도 그들이 원하는 몸매는 34–24-36의 미스코리아 몸매지 넉넉한 노처녀 몸매가 아니잖아.” “다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 봤어?” “그게 뭐야?” “‘저스트’라는 그룹이 하는 예능인데, 요즘 대세거든. 지금까지는 가수나 배우 하면 신비주의 전략을 썼잖아. 근데 얘들은 지네가 사는 반지하 숙소도 다 공개하고, 아침에 일어나서 부스스한 모습. 다 늘어진 티셔츠 입은 모습까지 다 공개하면서 대중들한테 친근한 이미지로 다가가거든.” “친근한 이미지?” “응. 삼전 전자도 언제까지 10센티미터도 넘는 하이힐 신은 여자가 요리하는 광고나 할 거야?” “…….” 전재형 부회장은 입을 다물었다. 전재형은 철저한 사업가였다. 임선미만큼 예쁜 연예인이야 수없이 많다. 그런데 여전히 임선미를 만나고 있는 것은 임선미만큼 말 통하는 여자도 없기 때문이다. “다섯 남자와 아기 바구니 할 시간이네. 자기도 한번 봐. 요즘 대중들이 원하는 게 바로 이런 거야.” 임선미가 TV를 켰다. 마침 성국이가 걸음마 하는 장면이 나오고 있었다. “어머, 성국이네.” 전재형은 몸을 앞으로 기울였다. “쟤가 저번에 너랑 광고 찍은 아기지?” 임선미를 보러 갔을 때, 대기실 문틈 사이로 해맑게 웃고 있던 성국이를 본 기억이 떠올랐다. 마치 자신을 아는 듯 손을 흔드는 모습이 인상적이었다. 임선미가 전재형의 어깨를 주무르기 시작했다. “저게 요즘 인기야?” “완전 국민 육아 프로그램이라니까.” 전재형은 성국이에게서 눈을 떼지 못했다. “귀엽네. 녀석.” 그런데 이상한 기시감이 들었다. ‘저 녀석, 왜 이렇게 눈에 익지….’ * * * 전재형은 오찬 모임이 끝나고 부회장실에 들어섰다. 양 비서가 뒤를 따랐다. “오늘 오찬 모임 잘 하셨습니까?” “반도체 공장 확장으로 골치가 좀 아프네.” “그래도 지금 확장하시는 게 미래를 위해서 현명한 선택이신 것 같습니다.” 양 비서는 중진들 못지않은 선구안이 있어서 종종 전재형 부회장에게 조언도 했다. 전재형 부회장이 좋아하는 커피를 한 잔 마셨다. “양 비서.” “네, 부회장님.” “자네도 다섯 남자와 아기 바구니란 프로 보나?” “부회장님도 그 프로 아세요?” “어제 우연히 좀 봤어.” 다섯 남자와 아기 바구니란 프로를 떠올리자마자 양 비서의 얼굴엔 화색이 돌았다. “거기 성국이란 애가 너무 귀여워서요. 저희 집 애도 너무 좋아해요.” 전재형은 턱을 매만졌다. “그 프로 인기 요인이 뭐라고 생각하나, 양 비서는?” “다들 육아는 한 번씩 해본 일이기도 하고. 안 했다 하더라도 할 일을 대리 체험하는 느낌도 있고요.” “거기다 이웃에 있을 것 같은 아이와 남자 애들의 우당탕탕. 뭐 그런 건가?” “그렇죠. 회장님, 어제 잠시 보셨다면서 다 파악하셨네요.” 임선미의 말처럼 친근함이 먹히고 있었다. 거기다 육아 대리 체험까지. “그 성국이란 아이 좀 알아보지. 우리 세탁기 광고에도 나온 아이라며?” “이유 여쭤봐도 될까요? 거기에 맞춰서 조사하겠습니다.” “우리 삼전 전자도 이제 하이힐 신은 여자가 요리하는 거 말고, 친근한 이미지로 접근해야 하는 게 아닌가 싶어서. 가전이 크지만, 반도체는 막 성장하는 추세니까 그런 우리의 기업 이미지를 그 아이의 성장과 함께 보여주는 것도 좋을 것 같아서.” “네, 알겠습니다. 알아보겠습니다.” 양 비서가 문을 열고 나갔다. 양 비서는 나오면서 고개를 갸웃했다. 전재형 부회장이 아기 모델까지 관심을 가진 경우는 거의 없었다. 물론 통돌이 세탁기 광고가 공전의 히트를 기록하긴 했지만, 광고사에서 제안도 안 했는데 직접 지시를 내린 것은 처음이었다. * * * 엄마는 민국이를 데리고 다음 날 바로 퇴원했다. 철의 여인이 막내 여동생을 낳을 때는 한 달 동안 병원 VIP 병실에 누워 있었지만, 이때는 산후조리원도 없었고, 엄마에게는 그럴 여유도 없었다. 동시에 이 비좁은 원룸에 식구가 한 명 더 늘었다. 침대도 없는 바닥에 이불을 깔고 엄마와 민국이가 누웠다. 나는 가만히 다가가 민국이를 내려다봤다. 시뻘건 핏덩이가 조금씩 형체를 갖춰가고 있었다. 딱 봐도 인물은 나보다 못했다. 기럭지도 나보다 살짝 작은 것 같았다. 역시 우월한 모든 유전자는 나에게 몰빵된 게 분명했다. 엄마가 내 등을 토닥였다. “성국아, 동생 귀엽지?” [경쟁자 녀석이 귀여울 리가.] 나는 고개를 도리도리 저었다. “성국아. 엄마, 아빠는 우리 성국이가 혼자가 아니었으면 했거든. 진짜 동생이 생겨서 다행이야.” 이게 뭔 소리야? “엄마랑 아빠는 세상에서 혼자잖아. 부모도 없고, 의지할 형제도 없고. 그래서 결혼할 때 능력 되는 대로 낳자고 약속했어.” 나는 묵묵히 엄마의 이야기를 들었다. 내게 가족이 의지할 수 있는 존재였던가? 언제나 경쟁하고, 견제해야 할 대상이었는데. “엄마, 아빠가 민국이에게 든든한 울타리가 돼주기 위해 진짜 열심히 일하잖아. 엄마, 아빠가 죽으면 민국이가 우리 성국이 울타리가 되어줄 거야. 성국이가 형이니까, 민국이 잘 돌봐줄 거지?” 나는 민국이를 내려다봤다. 두 살이 어린 핏덩이. 나는 민국이의 작은 손을 잡아 쥐었다. 따뜻하고 보드라웠다. 나는 민국이의 귓가에 조용히 속삭였다. [동생, 너 내 뒤통수치면 죽을 줄 알아.] 그러곤 엄마를 향해 해맑게 웃으며 대답했다. “응!” 띵동. 초인종 소리가 들렸다. 안 봐도 누구인지 알 것 같았다. 엄마가 문을 열자 김미영이 과일과 큰 냄비 하나를 들고 들어섰다. “언니, 그게 다 뭐예요?” “미역국. 내가 끓인 건 아니고, 요 앞 슈퍼 아주머니한테 부탁해서 끓였어요. 산모가 몸조리하는 동안 잘 먹어야죠. 그리고 내일부터 아줌마도 올 거예요. 집안일 하고, 성국이도 좀 봐주고요.” “언니, 저희 그럴 돈이.” “걱정 말아요. 이건 성국이 매니저인 내가 내는 거니까요.” “언니….” 엄마는 말문이 막혔다. 방 안에 묘한 기류가 흘렀다. 감동의 쓰나미가 몰려올 것 같은. [이건 절대 못 참지.] 나는 얼른 김미영이 가져온 과일 봉지에서 사과를 집어 방 안에 하나둘 투척하면서 까르르 웃었다. 엄마는 얼른 정신을 차리더니 나를 안았다. “언니, 정말 감사해요. 성국이 낳고 혼자 몸조리했거든요.” “참, 방송국에서 연락 왔어요. 2주 후에 촬영 들어가자고요. 성국아, 알았지?” “응.” 김미영은 얼른 말을 돌렸다. 김미영도 닭살스러운 반응에는 알레르기가 있는 모양이었다. 나는 어서 이 답답한 원룸을 벗어나 촬영장에 나가고 싶은 심정이었다. 누워만 있는 민국이야 모르겠지만, 이제 막 걷기 시작해서 혈기가 주체가 안 되는 나에게 원룸은 너무 좁았다. 김미영은 어느새 사과를 깎아 내 손에 쥐여줬다. 나는 손에 사과를 쥐고 단맛을 입으로 쪽쪽 빨았다. “107호, 이제 이사 좀 생각해보는 거 어때요? 성국이도 조금만 있으면 두 돌이잖아요. 애도 벌써 둘인데 원룸은 너무 좁지 않아요?” “좁긴 해도 전 여기가 편해서요. 아직 애들 어리니까, 여기서 돈 좀 더 벌면 옮기고 싶어서요.” “성국이가 ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 출연한 지도 벌써 두 달째잖아요. 출연료만 200만 원 들어왔어요. 매니저 비용 빼더라도 성국이한테 돌아갈 돈이 150만 원이에요.” “그거 다 저축해야죠. 성국이가 힘들게 일해서 번 돈인데, 저희가 그걸 함부로 쓸 수 없을 것 같아서요.” 나는 주먹을 앙 쥐고 가슴을 탕탕 내려쳤다.

[이러면 약해지는데.] 나는 어느새 엄마를 따라 웃고 있었다. “까르르.” “참, 그리고요. 오늘 또 온 용건이 있어요.” “뭔데요?” “성국이를 광고에 쓰고 싶다는 제의가 수없이 들어와요.” “저희 6개월 동안은 광고 금지잖아요.” “그렇죠. 근데 그 6개월도 이제 4개월밖에 안 남았잖아요. 이미 성국이 스타성이야 입증된 거고, 광고 업계에서 난리예요.” [내 이럴 줄 알았지. 역시 삼전 그룹을 운영하던 내 감각은 죽지 않았어.] 나는 가만히 김미영의 말에 귀를 기울였다. “광고가 많이 들어오는 만큼 성국이 이미지를 생각해서 우선은 대기업 위주로 접근하면 좋을 것 같아요.” “대기업이요?” “저번에 통돌이 세탁기 광고했던 삼전 전자에서 전속 모델 제의가 왔어요. 물론 금액도 업계 최고액을 제시했고요.” 이번 생은 묘하게 삼전 그룹과 엮이는 기분이었다. 삼전 그룹의 장남에서 가난한 집 첫째로 태어나 나락으로 떨어졌지만, 삼전 그룹의 도움을 조금만 받는다면 좀 더 빨리 이 집안을 일으켜 세울 수 있을 것 같았다. 엄마의 표정에 걱정이 앞섰다. “남편이랑 상의해 봐야겠지만, 언니는 어떻게 생각해요?” “나 말 돌리는 거 못 하잖아요. 솔직히 이야기할게요. 성국이 지금 가장 예쁘지만, 아이들 크면서 얼굴이 수십 번 바뀐다잖아요. 언제 어떻게 변할지 모르잖아요.” [난 역변 아니고 정변의 아이콘이 될 거야. 걱정 마, 매니저.] “삼전 전자에서 제시한 조건 너무 좋고요. 성국이 엄마, 아빠가 성국이 미래를 위해서라면 어릴 적에 광고로 돈 착실히 모아서 어서 자리 잡는 게 좋을 것 같아요.” 엄마는 여전히 불안한 눈빛이었다. [물 들어올 때 노 저으라고 했어, 엄마. 지금은 닥치는 대로 뭐든 해서 돈 벌 때야. 내가 조금만 더 크면 주식도 하고 부동산도 해서 엄마, 아빠 편하게 살게 해 줄게.] 나는 진지하게 엄마에게 이야기했다. 물론 엄마는 내 이야기를 알아들을 수 없었다. “으앙. 으아앙!” 하필 이때 민국이 녀석이 울음을 터트리는 통에 우리의 진지한 대화는 더는 불가능했다. 엄마는 얼른 민국이를 안았다. “언니, 남편이랑 상의해 볼게요.” “그럼, 우선 먼저 만나나 보는 건 어때요? 나도 삼전 기획에서 근무해서 잘 알잖아요. 삼전 전자 광고 전속 모델은 정말 놓치기 아까운 자리거든요.” “딱 하루만 고민해 볼게요.” “으앙. 으아악!” 민국이가 울어댔다. 나는 시끄러워서 귀를 두 손으로 닫아버렸다. 엄마는 이제 나보다는 울고 보채는 민국이 달래기에 바빴다. “민국아, 배고파? 잠깐만 기다려.” 엄마가 우유를 탈 동안 나는 민국이를 물끄러미 쳐다봤다. 나는 더는 바쁜 엄마에게 안아달라고 떼쓰지도 않았다. 배고프거나 기저귀가 불편할 때만 성질을 부렸다. [이렇게 어른이 되는 거겠지.] 나는 쓸쓸히 홀로 사과의 단물을 빨았다.","completion":"Episode 14 The camera was capturing my reaction as I looked at my newborn brother. A bright red and incredibly ugly newborn baby. And on top of that, a boy. His name was Minguk. Before my regression, the birth of a younger brother meant only one thing to me. A rival has appeared! But now, I was making an infinitely moved expression as an older brother. Because the camera kept focusing on me. Dad kept pushing me closer to Minguk, who was visible through the glass window. \\"Sungguk, it's your brother. Minguk.\\" \\"Mingguki.\\" \\"Sungguk, won't you call your brother's name? Our Sungguk is really amazing.\\" Dad showered my face with kisses, overwhelmed with emotion. [Please, go away. Even if you're my dad, I'd rather not have kisses from a man.] I squirmed, but the more I did, the tighter Dad hugged me. I had to get out of this situation. I quickly placed my hand on the glass window and acted out the deeply moved expression of a brother waiting for his sibling's birth. \\"Mingguki. Heh.\\" And then I smiled brightly. \\"Cut!\\" The director's voice came from behind. \\"Wow, this is totally a hit. A mega-hit. This will definitely boost the ratings again.\\" The director kept marveling. \\"Director, Sungguk really seems to know what people want. This alone would be enough to air.\\" The assistant director quickly praised me. I shrugged my shoulders. Shrug, shrug. Beomseon poked my cheek with his finger. \\"Sungguk, becoming a brother has made you so mature.\\" [I've been mature since I was born.] The nurse presented Minguk again from beyond the glass window. \\"You should go in now. Take one last look.\\" Held in Dad's arms, I looked down at the bloodied Minguk. The bright red Minguk couldn't even open his eyes properly. But I warned him with my eyes. From now on, there would be absolutely no mercy, even if he was my brother. \\"Then, I'll go in.\\" The nurse took Minguk inside. The staff prepared to leave, and the 'Just' members all caught their breath. \\"Sungguk, it must be nice to have a brother!\\" Lucas playfully teased me. [Lucas, didn't I tell you that you had cabbage stuck in your teeth?] Holding me, Lucas was shocked to see his reflection in the glass window. \\"What! I have cabbage in my teeth.\\" \\"That's why I told you to look in the mirror in the car. You said you were sleepy. Tsk tsk.\\" Jaehyun clicked his tongue. Lucas pointed at Michael and laughed. \\"Michael, you're ketchup!\\" But Michael didn't say or do anything during the entire shoot. It was because of the director's words. Michael apologized to the director several times, but the director didn't respond and just continued filming. The director passed by Michael and spoke to the other members with a smile. \\"You all did really well, so natural! You guys should compete with a friendly image. Alright, rest today and see you at the next broadcast.\\" The director thoroughly ignored Michael with a smile and approached Dad with an envelope. \\"Sir, you've worked really hard today.\\" \\"What is this, Director?\\" \\"I couldn't prepare a proper gift for the birth. This is something personal from me. Oh, and the hospital bills have been taken care of by the broadcasting station.\\" \\"The hospital bills are covered, so that's enough, Director.\\" \\"Please take it. I'll be more upset if you don't. Honestly, the appearance fee is fixed, and you can't do commercials for a while.\\" Dad reluctantly accepted the envelope the director offered. \\"Thank you so much, Director.\\" \\"We should be thanking you. Thanks to Sungguk, our ratings will rise again. This kid, really, does he know acting? How does he produce the exact scene we want whenever the camera is pointed at him? 'Mingguki.' With just that one word, all my worries disappeared.\\" \\"Sungguk really waited for his brother.\\" [Could it be... me?] The director gently grabbed and released my cheek. \\"Got it, you little one. You wanted to see your brother. By the way, sir. Since we have footage already shot and now the scene of Sungguk meeting his brother, the next shoot might be a bit more relaxed.\\" I smiled broadly at the director, a kind of flattery. [Please take good care of me in the future, Director.] The director smiled. \\"Sungguk, even if you miss me, don't cry.\\" \\"Okay.\\" I nodded my head. \\"Oh, what a good boy.\\" In the world of capital, the most important thing is to quickly figure out to whom you should bow your head. In this shooting site, the director was king. * * * Im Sunmi had just finished showering. Jeon Jaehyung was reading the newspaper on the sofa, wearing only a bathrobe. \\"Honey, are you staying over tonight?\\" \\"I have an early luncheon meeting tomorrow.\\" One of Jeon Jaehyung's rules was to have affairs but never to spend the night out. It was an unwritten rule among the Samjeon Group families. No matter how much they strayed, they believed in keeping the family intact. Even if they met someone for a fling, spending a day or two could turn into a week, and then a month, and Jeon Jaehyung knew this better than anyone. That would turn a simple fling, which could be resolved with a few bucks, into a headache when it came time to break up. Im Sunmi poured whiskey with a disappointed expression and placed it in front of Jeon Jaehyung. \\"Your favorite.\\" \\"Thanks.\\" \\"Honey, after I finish filming this movie, shall we go to the US?\\" \\"Sure.\\" The future was uncertain. But saying something unpleasant or difficult right now would only lead to a fight with the woman in front of him, which was just a waste of energy. Jeon Jaehyung was starting to get bored of Im Sunmi. He first met Im Sunmi when she was going through a slump. Already a popular high-teen star, she attempted to transform into an adult actress by starring in a provocative movie with explicit scenes, which backfired. <Nobody wants to see the exposed Im Sunmi, the nation's little sister.> The movie flopped, and Im Sunmi's image was ruined, leading her to slowly fade from public attention. Shin Sungjung saved Im Sunmi. He introduced Im Sunmi to Jeon Jaehyung, who had been a fan of her during her high-teen days. Im Sunmi didn't find Jeon Jaehyung's first impression bad either. One of Korea's top chaebols, tall, well-maintained looks despite being in his 40s, and even a mature charm. Moreover, maintaining a good relationship with Jeon Jaehyung could offer her the chance to become an exclusive model for Samjeon Electronics. The money she earned as a high-teen star was squandered by her father and brother in business ventures, leaving her with debt. Of course, Jeon Jaehyung's reputation with women was well-known in the entertainment industry. It was said that it was hard to find an actress who hadn't been involved with Jeon Jaehyung. Jeon Jaehyung was looking at a Samjeon Electronics ad in the newspaper. Of course, Im Sunmi was in it. It was for a newly launched refrigerator. \\"Sunmi, you seem to have gained some weight.\\" \\"I gained some weight for a role as a 30-year-old spinster.\\" Im Sunmi had noticed that Jeon Jaehyung's gaze on her had changed. So, she deliberately took on roles different from her usual sophisticated image, like that of a spinster. Jeon Jaehyung had been a good stepping stone, and now was the time for Im Sunmi to change her acting career. Jeon Jaehyung slightly raised his eyebrows. \\"Our Samjeon Electronics appliances target young, sophisticated city women. Even if they get married and have children, they still want the 34–24–36 Miss Korea figure, not the generous body of a spinster.\\" \\"Have you seen 'Five Men and a Baby Basket'?\\" \\"What's that?\\" \\"It's a reality show by the group 'Just,' and it's really popular these days. Until now, singers and actors used a strategy of mystique. But these guys expose everything, including their semi-basement living quarters, their disheveled looks when they wake up, and even wearing stretched-out T-shirts.\\" \\"A friendly image?\\" \\"Yeah. Will Samjeon Electronics keep making ads with women in 10-centimeter heels cooking?\\" \\"...\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung kept his mouth shut. Jeon Jaehyung was a thorough businessman. There were countless pretty entertainers like Im Sunmi. But he was still seeing Im Sunmi because there was no one else who understood him as well as she did. \\"It's time for 'Five Men and a Baby Basket.' You should watch it too. This is what the public wants these days.\\" Im Sunmi turned on the TV. Just then, a scene of Sungguk taking his first steps was playing. \\"Oh, it's Sungguk.\\" Jeon Jaehyung leaned forward. \\"Is that the baby you filmed the ad with?\\" When he visited Im Sunmi, he remembered seeing Sungguk smiling brightly through the door crack, waving as if he knew him. Im Sunmi started massaging Jeon Jaehyung's shoulders. \\"Is this what's popular now?\\" \\"It's the nation's childcare program.\\" Jeon Jaehyung couldn't take his eyes off Sungguk. \\"He's cute. The kid.\\" But he felt a strange sense of déjà vu. 'Why does this kid look so familiar...' * * * After the luncheon meeting, Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung entered his office. Secretary Yang followed him. \\"Did the luncheon meeting go well?\\" \\"The expansion of the semiconductor factory is giving me a headache.\\" \\"Still, expanding now seems like a wise choice for the future.\\" Secretary Yang often gave advice to Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung, showing foresight not inferior to the executives. Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung enjoyed a cup of his favorite coffee. \\"Secretary Yang.\\" \\"Yes, Vice Chairman.\\" \\"Do you watch 'Five Men and a Baby Basket'?\\" \\"Vice Chairman, you know about that show?\\" \\"I happened to watch a bit yesterday.\\" Just mentioning 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' brought a smile to Secretary Yang's face. \\"That Sungguk kid is so cute. My child loves him too.\\" Jeon Jaehyung stroked his chin. \\"What do you think is the reason for the show's popularity, Secretary Yang?\\" \\"Everyone has experienced or will experience childcare. Even if they haven't, it feels like a vicarious experience.\\" \\"And the chaotic but familiar interactions between the child and the men, something like that?\\" \\"Exactly. Vice Chairman, you grasped it all just by watching briefly yesterday.\\" Im Sunmi's words about friendliness were proving to be true. And the vicarious experience of childcare. \\"Look into that kid Sungguk. He's the one from our washing machine ad, right?\\" \\"May I ask why? I'll tailor the investigation accordingly.\\" \\"We at Samjeon Electronics might need to approach with a friendlier image, not just a woman in high heels cooking. Appliances are important, but as semiconductors are growing rapidly, showing our corporate image growing alongside that child might be good.\\" \\"Yes, I understand. I'll look into it.\\" Secretary Yang left the room. As he left, he tilted his head. It was rare for Vice Chairman Jeon Jaehyung to show interest in a baby model. Of course, the drum washing machine ad was a huge hit, but it was the first time he had given direct instructions without the advertising agency's suggestion. * * * Mom and Minguk were discharged from the hospital the next day. The iron lady had stayed in the VIP hospital room for a month when she gave birth to her youngest sister, but this time, there was no luxury of a postnatal care center, and Mom couldn't afford it. At the same time, our cramped one-room apartment gained one more member. Without a bed, Mom and Minguk lay on a blanket spread on the floor. I quietly approached and looked down at Minguk. The bright red lump of flesh was slowly taking shape. At a glance, he was less handsome than me. His legs seemed slightly shorter than mine. Clearly, all the superior genes had been concentrated in me. Mom patted my back. \\"Sungguk, isn't your brother cute?\\" [A rival can't be cute.] I shook my head. \\"Sungguk. Mom and Dad didn't want our Sungguk to be alone. It's really a relief that we have a real brother now.\\" What is she talking about? \\"Mom and Dad are alone in this world. No parents, no siblings to rely on. So when we got married, we promised to have as many children as we could afford.\\" I silently listened to Mom's story. Were my family members ever a source of reliance for me? They were always competitors, objects of jealousy. \\"Mom and Dad are working really hard to be a strong fence for Minguk. When Mom and Dad are gone, Minguk will be Sungguk's fence. Since Sungguk is the older brother, you'll take good care of Minguk, right?\\" I looked down at Minguk. A two-year-old lump of flesh. I grabbed Minguk's tiny hand. It was warm and soft. I whispered quietly in Minguk's ear. [Brother, if you ever stab me in the back, you're dead.] Then I turned to Mom and smiled brightly. \\"Yes!\\" Ding-dong. The doorbell rang. I knew who it was without looking. Mom opened the door, and Kim Miyoung entered with fruit and a large pot. \\"Sister, what's all this?\\" \\"Seaweed soup. I didn't make it myself; I asked the lady at the supermarket in front. A new mother needs to eat well during recovery. And starting tomorrow, a housekeeper will come. She'll take care of the house and watch Sungguk too.\\" \\"Sister, we don't have the money for that.\\" \\"Don't worry. This is coming from Sungguk's manager, me.\\" \\"Sister...\\" Mom was at a loss for words. A strange atmosphere filled the room. A tsunami of emotion seemed about to hit. [I absolutely can't stand this.] I quickly grabbed an apple from Kim Miyoung's fruit bag and threw it around the room, laughing loudly. Mom quickly regained her composure and hugged me. \\"Sister, thank you so much. I recovered alone after giving birth to Sungguk.\\" \\"By the way, the broadcasting station called. They want to start filming in two weeks. Sungguk, got it?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Kim Miyoung quickly changed the subject. It seemed she had an allergy to mushy reactions too. I just wanted to get out of this cramped one-room apartment and go to the filming site. Minguk, who was just lying there, might not care, but for me, who had just started walking and couldn't contain my energy, the one-room was too small. Kim Miyoung had already peeled an apple and placed it in my hand. I sucked on the sweet juice of the apple in my hand. \\"107, how about thinking about moving? Sungguk will be two soon. It's too cramped here for two kids in a one-room.\\" \\"It's cramped, but I'm comfortable here. The kids are still young, so I want to save up a bit more before moving.\\" \\"Sungguk has been on 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' for two months now. He's already brought in 2 million won in appearance fees. Even after manager fees, Sungguk has 1.5 million won coming to him.\\" \\"That money all needs to be saved. Sungguk worked hard to earn it, so we can't just spend it recklessly.\\" I clenched my fist and pounded my chest. [Stagnant water can't become the sea. Just saving up won't do any good; it only benefits the bank!] Kim Miyoung picked me up. \\"What's Sungguk saying? Why are you hitting your chest? This kid always has so many opinions.\\" \\"Recently, he always interrupts when my husband and I talk.\\" Mom tickled my stomach and laughed along with me. [This makes me weak.] I soon found myself laughing along with Mom. \\"Kkarr.\\" \\"By the way, I have another reason for coming today.\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"There have been countless offers to use Sungguk in commercials.\\" \\"But we have a six-month commercial ban.\\" \\"That's true. But only four months are left of that six-month period. Sungguk's star quality is already proven, and the advertising industry is buzzing.\\" [I knew it. My sense for running Samjeon Group hasn't faded.] I listened intently to Kim Miyoung's words. \\"Since there are so many offers, it would be good to approach major corporations first, considering Sungguk's image.\\" \\"Major corporations?\\" \\"Samjeon Electronics, who did the drum washing machine ad, has offered an exclusive model contract. Of course, they've proposed the highest amount in the industry.\\" This life strangely intertwined with Samjeon Group. From the eldest son of Samjeon Group to the eldest son of a poor family, I had fallen to rock bottom, but with a little help from Samjeon Group, I felt I could lift this family up faster. Mom looked worried. \\"I'll have to discuss it with my husband, but what do you think, sister?\\" \\"I'm straightforward, you know that. Honestly, Sungguk is at his cutest now, but kids' faces change dozens of times as they grow. Who knows how he'll change.\\" [I'll be the icon of positive change, not negative. Don't worry, manager.] \\"Samjeon Electronics' offer is too good. For Sungguk's future, it's better to earn money through commercials while he's young and settle down quickly.\\" Mom still looked uneasy. [You have to row when the water comes in, Mom. Now's the time to do whatever it takes to make money. I'll grow up a bit more and then invest in stocks and real estate to make Mom and Dad comfortable.] I seriously communicated with Mom. Of course, Mom couldn't understand what I was saying. \\"Uwaa. Uwaaa!\\" Just then, Minguk started crying, making our serious conversation impossible. Mom quickly picked up Minguk. \\"Sister, I'll discuss it with my husband.\\" \\"How about we meet first? I know Samjeon Planning well because I worked there. An exclusive model contract for Samjeon Electronics' ads is a position too good to miss.\\" \\"I'll think about it for just one day.\\" \\"Uwaa. Uwaaa!\\" Minguk continued to cry. I covered my ears because it was too loud. Mom was now too busy soothing Minguk to pay attention to me. \\"Minguk, are you hungry? Just wait a bit.\\" While Mom prepared milk, I stared at Minguk."},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"I no longer threw tantrums to be held by my busy mom.

Analysis of these impacts, termed as the Triple Bottom Line (TBL), stimulated a tremendous interest by policy makers over the last decade. Therefore, current research aims to analyze the TBL of U.S. final demands from a systems perspective. To accomplish this goal, the supply and use tables published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis are merged with a range of environmental, economic, and social metrics. The results show that household consumption has the largest indirect TBL sustainability impacts compared to other final demand categories with shares that range between 43% and 88%. Industrial sectors including manufacturing, utilities, agriculture, construction, transportation, and mining are generally found to be responsible for the highest impacts for most of the environmental impact categories. Service sectors generally have the highest impacts on the economic and social indicators of sustainability. Analysis results also indicate that while meeting the household demand, agriculture, utilities, and manufacturing sectors have relatively more environmental impacts than their contributions to gross domestic product (GDP), whereas service sectors contribute to GDP with a higher share than their environmental burdens. Furthermore, it is envisioned that significant reductions in environmental footprints of U.S. households can be achieved if environmental policies that aim to reduce the household consumption are also supported with sustainable growth through greener and resource efficient economy In this study, the supply and use tables published by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (2002), as part of the International System of National Accounts, are merged with a range of TBL sustainability metrics to develop a holistic EIO framework for the U.S. final demand categories. We used a single region industry-bycommodity model in which imported commodities are assumed to be produced with domestic technology. Similar modeling approach and domestic technology assumption were also employed for analyzing the ecological footprints of U.K's final consumption (Wiedmann et al., 2006). In this model, the inputoutput multipliers represent the total TBL impacts based on per unit of final demand of commodities produced by industrial sectors. This format is utilized since the basic inputeoutput model presents the financial flows between industrial sectors without distinguishing between primary and secondary products. By using this format, it is possible to accounts for the fact that an industry can produce more than one commodity, such as secondary products and by-products (Wachsmann et al., 2009). The Eurostat manual provides a comprehensive and detailed discussion on the use of this framework (Eurostat, 2008). In this model, the Use matrix, which is usually represented by U, gives information on the consumption of commodities by industries or by final demand categories, such as households, government, investment or export. As a component of U, uij denotes the value of commodity purchase of commodity i by industry j and xj represent the total output of industry j including imports. Therefore, bij is the amount of commodity i required for producing onedollar output of industry j. By using the total industrial output of industry j, the technical coefficient matrix B can be written as (Miller and Blair, 2009): B ¼ bij ¼ \\" uij xj # (1) In addition, the Make matrix, which is denoted as V, provides detailed information on production of commodities by industries. In the make table, each row represents the production of commodity by different industries. As an element ofV, vji is the value of the output of commodity i by industry j and qi accounts for the total (domestic plus imported) output of commodity i. Therefore, dji represents the fraction of total commodity i output which is produced by industries, both as main product as well as by-product. Using the total output of commodity i, the industry-based technology coefficient matrix D can be written as (Miller and Blair, 2009): D ¼ dji ¼ vji qi (2) After defining B and D, the industry-by-commodity inputeoutput model can be formulated as follows k ¼ h DðI BDÞ 1 i f (3) where k represents the total industry output vector, I is the identity matrix, and f refers to the total final demand vector for commodities. In addition, B is the input requirements for products per unit of output of an industry matrix, and D is sometimes called as market-share matrix. Also, the term [D(I-BD) ¡1 ] represents the total requirement matrix, which is also known as the Leontief inverse. Also, BD is the direct requirement matrix, which is represented by A matrix in Leontief's model (Leontief, 1970). After industry-by-commodity inputeoutput framework has been established, indirect sustainability impacts can be quantified by multiplying the final demand of a sector with the multiplier matrix. Then, a vector of total sustainability impacts can be formulated as follows: r ¼ Edirk ¼ Edirh DðI BDÞ 1 i f (4) where r denotes the total impacts vector which represents overall sustainability impacts per unit of final demand, and Edir matrix consists of the direct environmental, economic, and social impact values per dollar of output for each industrial sector. Each element of this matrix is calculated by dividing the total direct sectoral impact (e.g. carbon footprint, income, tax) with the total economic output of that sector. In addition, the product of Edir and bracketed term [D(I-BD) ¡1 ] represents the multiplier matrix To have a better insight into the sustainability effects of final demand categories, life-cycle investigations should go beyond traditional P-LCA and EIO-LCA, which are generally used for analyzing the environmental impacts, mainly energy, water, carbon, and land footprints. To accomplish this goal, we extended the scope of the EIO methodology by adding several prominent sustainability assessment metrics to answer the questions regarding sustainable consumption and investments in U.S. For future studies, an integrated approach of goal programming and EIO model can provide alternative solutions for optimizing the TBL sustainability implications of different final demand categories. Miller and Blair (2009) developed a policy programming model in which a goal programming based multi-criteria optimization model is combined with the inputeoutput analysis to optimize the multiple environmental, economic and social objectives, simultaneously. We believe that using integrated approaches can provide sound policies regarding the optimum output of different sectors based on final consumption and investments. In terms of long term policy making, system dynamics (SD) modeling is a crucial future research direction, which can provide insights about mid and long term policy making (Egilmez and Tatari, 2012). Therefore, integration of EIO analysis and SD models is among the future research goals of the authors. Although this paper utilized detailed supply and use tables which include 426 economic sectors, current results have significant uncertainties related to using domestic technology assumption for imported products. Therefore, environmental impact results might be different due to the fact that imported products are produced with foreign technology. In addition, production of these materials may require less or more amounts of ecological resources. For future studies, to have a trade-linked EIO model, a global MRIO framework can be developed in order to account for the impacts of international trade in a way that environmental, economic, and social implications of the U.S. final demands will account for the technological differences related to production of imported materials. The importance of applying MRIO models can be found in the literature","completion":"Обзор литературы: Применение модифицированной методологии межотраслевого баланса получило широкое распространение в исследованиях экономических, экологических и социальных последствий финального потребления в различных странах. Например, в США была проведена аналитика влияния конечного потребления на устойчивое развитие с использованием таблиц предложений и использования, опубликованных Бюро экономического анализа США. Исследование показало, что потребление домохозяйств имеет наибольшие косвенные воздействия на устойчивость в сравнении с другими категориями конечного спроса, затрагивая от 43% до 88% показателей Тройного нижнего баланса (TBL: экологические, экономические и социальные аспекты). Промышленные сектора, такие как производство, коммунальное хозяйство, сельское хозяйство, строительство, транспорт и горнодобывающая промышленность, обычно несут наибольшую ответственность за большинство экологических последствий, в то время как сектора услуг оказывают наибольшее воздействие на экономические и социальные показатели устойчивости. Была применена модель «одного региона, промышленность-по-товару», предполагающая, что импортируемые товары производятся с использованием отечественных технологий. Этот подход позволил учитывать не только финансовые потоки между отраслями, но и давать информацию о потреблении товаров различными отраслями или категориями конечного спроса. Так, были определены матрицы технических коэффициентов для производства и потребления товаров, что дало возможность формулировать модель взаимодействия отраслей и товаров, а также косвенную оценку устойчивости на основе конечного спроса. В работе уделено внимание необходимости расширения возможностей традиционной оценки жизненного цикла и методологии входов-выходов (EIO-LCA) за счет включения дополнительных показателей устойчивости для более полного анализа устойчивого потребления и инвестиций в США. Предложено использование интегрированных подходов, таких как сочетание модели программирования целей с анализом входов-выходов для оптимизации экологических, экономических и социальных целей. Кроме того, указано на будущее направление объединения анализа входов-выходов (EIO) с моделированием системной динамики (SD) для улучшения долгосрочного планирования политики. Тем не менее, использование предположения о домашней технологии для импортируемых продуктов влечет за собой значительные неопределенности, поскольку производство импортных товаров может требовать меньше или больше экологических ресурсов из-за различий в технологиях. В будущем исследовании предложено разработать глобальную модель MRIO для учета влияния международной торговли, что позволит точнее учитывать технологические различия и экологические, экономические, и социальные последствия конечного спроса США."},{"prompt":"сократи до 4-х предложений. мне нужно самое основное - какое исследование, какая модель","completion":"В США было проведено исследование влияния конечного потребления на устойчивость, используя таблицы предложений и использования в сочетании с показателями Тройного нижнего баланса (TBL).

To this end, the input–output analysis has been exploited for estimating the direct, indirect and induced macroeconomic effects associated with the implementation of selected energy conservation measures, the promotion of renewable energy technologies, etc. Our findings show that the required investments would reach the amount of h47.9 billion, over the period 2010–2020. These investments will result in an average annual increase of the national product by h9.4 billion, creating simultaneously 108,000 full-time equivalent jobs for the entire period under consideration. The employment generated per h1 million investment is relatively higher in energy saving projects in buildings and transport in comparison with the development of RES in power generation sector. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 2010) uses two approaches to measure the green employment growth: (1) the output approach, which identifies establishments that produce green goods and services and counts the associated jobs, and (2) the process approach, which identifies establishments that use environmentally friendly production processes and practices and counts the associated jobs. In the process approach, the industry uses practices or technologies that have a favorable impact on the environment, regardless of the good or service produced. These production practices include: (1) the production of green goods and services for use within the establishment, and (2) the use of methods, procedures, practices, or technologies that have a positive environmental or natural resources conservation impact. Our research pertains to the second case of the process approach. In general, the estimation of the macro-economic effects of green investments are based on two techniques: (1) macroeconomic models and, more specifically, the input–output model (International Labour Office and European Union (ILO and EU), 2011) that seeks to capture the direct, indirect and induced economic or environmental effects (top-down model) and (2) analytic process models based on the generation of employment coefficients, such as jobs per unit of production, etc (bottom-up)3 . The input–output analysis to estimate employment effects at macroeconomic level uses one of the following models: the basic input–output, the input output model (IOM), the social accounting matrices (SAM) and extensions of IOMs such as the computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, or dynamic SAMs models (Alarcon et al., 2011). These models estimate empirically how an economy may react to specific policies or external shocks or changes (International Labour Office and European Union (ILO and EU), 2011). The IOM, due to its economy-wide approach, is able to allocate all the impacts along the production and supply chain to each sector. This approach is fully consistent with the available accounting data and practices, while valid comparisons of environmental performance indicators are possible between sectors. Specifically, the IOM can estimate the economy-wide and sectoral impact on output, employment, and value-added of changes in the final demand for the goods and services produced by a particular sector or combination of sectors. In fact, the IOM captures these relationships and uses them to track how an initial increase in demand travels throughout the productive structure of the economy (International Labour Office and European Union (ILO and EU), 2011). In addition, environmental IOM requires a minimum of data and the required financial and accounting information is in most cases freely available, a fact that makes it a money saving and efficient technique. So far, IOMs have commonly been applied to evaluate targeted economic policies and to estimate short and medium term employment impacts. In the meantime, the conventional IOM includes a number of simplifying assumptions which constitute the limitations of this approach as it is a description of the situation when (i) linear relations express the production process of each unit or sector, (ii) each unit or sector experiences constant returns to scale, (iii) changes in relative prices and possible substitution effects are ignored, and (iv) production expands along with demand. Moreover, the technical coefficients in the input–output table are fixed for several years, whereas input–output country tables are usually available with delay (e.g., Greece). In view of the medium term (2010–2020) horizon of this study, productive relationships may be assumed to remain unchanged and industrial structure not to evolve substantially over this period. Moreover, the technology of industry that meets the green investments in the Greek economy is relatively mature and unlikely to change quickly, at least over a short or mediumterm period. Thus, the major simplifying assumptions mentioned above may be considered as acceptable. The estimation results of a generalised IOM is an f n matrix of factor multipliers that embodies f production factors (such as labour, etc.) per unit of final consumption of commodities produced by n industry sectors that can provide also the indirect and induced effects by means of the Leontief matrix. Here the work involves two steps: In the first we estimate the product created by green investments demand at the sectoral level while in the second the number of employees is calculated. Formally, in a first step we estimate the vector XGREEN, which expresses both the direct and indirect impacts of green investments on the output: XGREEN ¼ ðIAÞ 1FGreen ð1Þ where: (IA)1 is the Leontief inverse matrix, I the unit matrix, A the technology matrix, FGREEN the vector of ‘‘green’’ investments (final demand). The direct and indirect increase in output creates extra income and consequently an increase in consumption expenditures by households which, in turn, creates a new extra final demand and a new increase in output and employment. This effect is called induced effect, and for its estimation we expand the matrix A to include the private expenditure (by household) vector as a new column and the wages of employees row vector as a new row. In this case, we calculate the direct, indirect and induced ‘‘green’’ investments effect by means of the following equation: X0 GREEN ¼ ðIA0 Þ 1F0 GREEN ð2Þ where: X0 GREEN expresses the direct, indirect and inducted impacts on the output, (IA0 ) 1 is the Leontief expediting inverse matrix which includes the household consumption and the wages of employees, F0 GREEN is the vector of ‘‘green’’ investments.4 In a second step we estimate the change in employment using the direct coefficient (vector) l that expresses the employment per unit of sectoral output. This is given as: LGREEN ¼ lðIAÞ 1FGREEN ð3Þ where: LGREEN is the vector of the direct and indirect employment required for the completion of ‘‘green investments’’. The induced impacts on employment are calculated as follows: L0 GREEN ¼ l0 ðIA0 Þ 1F0 GREEN ð4Þ where: L0 GREEN is the vector of direct, indirect and induced employment caused by the ‘‘green’’ investments","completion":"В данной работе исследуются две основные цели: оценка объема \\"зеленых\\" инвестиций, необходимых Греции в различных промышленных секторах для достижения целей в области энергетики и экологии в контексте пакета мер Европейской Комиссии по энергетике и изменению климата, и анализ макроэкономических последствий этих инвестиций на производство и занятость в греческой экономике.

In this paper it is proved that the application of the currently existing monetary models of the intersectoral balance is associated with significant methodical errors. It is shown that price models based on the input balance provides such a balance only in unreal cases when the prices of all sectors are the same. For realistic conditions, when these requirements are not met, errors for these models reach unacceptable values. This article proposes and thoroughly investigated new price models based on output balances which do not have the said drawbacks. It is mathematically proven that the new models satisfy the output balances and do not have methodical errors. When used, they provide zero output imbalances for both theoretical and realistic data packets. Also in the paper the calculation results are presented both for the existing monetary models of input-output balance and for new price models using a wide set of initial data. The calculations performed confirm the theoretical conclusions of the article. It is also proved that the Leontief price model is a special case of the generalized model of price indices proposed in the work. This section presents two new monetary price models, namely, strictly speaking the price model and the model of price indices that do not contain methodical errors. Unlike the models discussed in the previous section, these models are not based on the input balance (5), but on the output balance (4). To build such a model, we first use the balance (4) in expanded form and, dividing each of its equations by the corresponding output in physical form , 1, i x i = n , we obtain a system of equations (24). , , , . 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 + + + + = = + + + + = = + + + + = = + + + + = = j i n ij i ii in i i i i i i i i i j ji jj jn j j j j j j j j j n ni nn n n nj n n n n n n n x f x x x x p x x x x x x x x x f x x p x x x x x x x x x x f x p x x x x x x x x x f x x p x x x x x x (24) Using the dependence (9), the system of equations (24) is transformed into the system (25). , , , . 11 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 + + + + = + + + + = + + + + = + + + + = j i n ij i ii in i i i i i i i i i i i j ji jj jn j j j j j j j j j j j n ni nn n nj n n n n n n n n n n x f x x x p p p p p x x x x x x x x f x p p p p p x x x x x x x x x f p p p p p x x x x x x x x f x p p p p p x x x x x (25) The system of equations (25) is a price monetary model in an expanded form. After entering the notation ∑ , =1 = / =1, j s x x ii ij i n i n (26) we obtain a monetary price model in matrix form ( ) = I S p − µ, (27) in which the matrix S has a diagonal structure with non-zero elements (26), р – price vector, µ – vector particles of final demand µі per physical unit of output of the i-th sector = f x/ , =1, . i i i µ i n (28) To verify the conformity of model (27) to the structure of IO, its i-th equation p x p f x i ij i i n i − i n is sufficient multiply by i x , as a result, it is converted into the equation of the balance of output (4). This indicates that the new model has no methodical errors. The main destination of the new model is to determine equilibrium prices and solve related problems based on the Input-Output methodology without methodical errors and limitations. No less important possibilities of its application are connected with the fact that the matrix (I - S) in the system (27) has a diagonal structure. This feature allows to find solutions of this system in analytical form. In turn, this provides an opportunity to determine the equilibrium prices and their changes in the current state through their value in the base state. That is, the prospect of building a new model of price indices opens up without the limitations and shortcomings that have, in particular, models (16), (17) and (18). Using the output balance (4), we obtain the diagonal element of the matrix S in the form s x f x = ( ) / ii i i i − (29) After that, the analytical solution of the system (27) is determined as = / , = , 1 . i i i i p x f i n µ (30) The presence of dependence (30) makes it possible to determine price indices in monetary form. For the current state, the analytical solution of the system of equations (27) has the form p x f i n i i i i = / , = , µ 1 (31) and for the base state . 0 0 0 0 = / , = 1, i i i i p µ x f i n (32) Determination of price indices βі , i n = 1, carried out as the ratio of their value рі in the current state to the value рі 0 in the base state . 0 0 0 0 = / = / , = 1, βi i i i i p p x f x f i n i i i i µ µ (33) With the involvement of (28) and after the introduction of symbols 0 i i i ∆ = − x x x and 0 i i i ∆ = − x x x we obtain the final dependence for price indices ∆ ∆ / / , . 0 0 β = (1+ ) / (1+ ) 1, x x x x n i i i i i i = (34) The generalized model of price indices also satisfies the balance of output (4). To prove this, we use the i-th equation of system (27) in the form / / ,         ∑ 1 0 0 i i = j ij β p x x β p f x n i i i i i = − or / / ,         ∑ 1 i i i i = j ij p x x p f x n i = − or ∑ . 1 i = j ij x x f n i = − The last expression is the modified balance of output (4) in monetary form. Thus, the generalized model of price indices also does not contain methodical errors. Model (34) is called a generalized model of price indices, because when ∆x 0 i = it becomes Leontief price model. This can be seen, in particular, by comparing the prices of Appendix A4 at ∆x 0 i = and prices of Appendix A2. That is, the Leontief price model (18) - (21) is a special case of model (34). When performing both theoretical and applied research, it is advisable to have not only dependencies for price indices, but also expressions for the deviation (change) of equilibrium prices compared to the baseline. Such expressions are obtained, in particular, by forming dependencies ( ) 0 0 p p p β / = 1, i i i i − − (35) or ( ) , . 0 p β = 1, 1 p n i i i ∆ − i = (36) Formula (36) is needed, in particular, to determine price multipliers. It is worth emphasizing that the dependence (30) provides another proof that the model (27) has no methodical errors. It is enough for this to substitute (28) in (30), after which we obtain an obvious dependence = 1, / , . i p x x n i i i = In contrast to the Leontief price model, the generalized model of price indices allows to use as a base state of the Input-Output system its arbitrary state, in which only the appropriate conditions of balance are provided. Theoretical research and digital experiments have shown that the currently known monetary price models of the intersectoral balance theory do not contain methodical errors only in some cases that are degenerate. In particular, Leontief price model has no methodical errors only in the case when all sectoral equilibrium prices are modulo one. The monetary price model, built on the input balance, will not have methodical errors, provided that the equilibrium prices obtained according to it will all be the same. Failure to comply with these requirements leads to a violation of the monetary input balance, and, as a consequence, to the emergence of methodical errors in decisions. By digital modeling, arrays of methodical errors are obtained when using these models depending on the input information. When using the theoretical data packet (changes in value added and physical outputs are in the range of ± 30%, the resulting prices are placed near the unit) the error rate for Leontiev price model reaches 30% and for the model formed on the input balance - more than 18%. Both of these significatives are unacceptable for practical use. When a realistic data packet was used (the ratio of monetary and physical output modules increased several times), the error rates for these models increased catastrophically: for the Leontief price model it was about 83% and for the model formed on the basis of input balance - almost 117%. According to such error rates, the relevant models should be classified as incorrect. Therefore, the currently existing price models and models derived from them analyzed in the paper are not suitable for practical use according to realistic data, as such use leads to unacceptably large errors. They can be used only in situations where the equilibrium sectoral prices of the module are equal to each other, or (moreover) equal to one. That is, they can be used only in theoretical research as degenerate cases. Proposed and comprehensively studied in the work of two new price models (price model, built on the basis of output balance, and the corresponding model of price indices) are devoid of these shortcomings. It is mathematically proved that both new models satisfy the balances of output. The consequence of this is that when they are used in digital modeling, zero output imbalances are provided for both theoretical and realistic data packets. In contrast to the Leontief price model, the generalized model of price indices allows us to use as the base state of the Input-Output system its arbitrary state, in which only the appropriate conditions of balance are provided. It is proved that the Leontief price model is a special case of the generalized model of price indices proposed in the work.","completion":"В этой статье анализируется применение существующих денежных моделей межотраслевого баланса, выявляя в них значительные методические ошибки, особенно при условиях реального различия в ценах между отраслями.

Леонтьева позволила смягчить топливный кризис 1970 г., продовольственный - 1972-1974 гг., экологический - конца 70-х начала 80-х годов. На основе межотраслевого баланса рассчитываются макроэкономические показатели, промежуточное потребление, затраты ресурсов, осуществляется анализ влияния спроса, цен, изменений в заработной плате на экономику в целом и на отдельные отрасли. Показатели межотраслевого баланса могут применяться также для международных сравнений производственных структур и результатов. В. Леонтьев экстраполировал методику на группу стран отдельных континентов и в итоге на всю экономику в целом. Если К. Маркс делил экономику на два сектора производство средств производства и средств потребления, то В. Леонтьев увеличил количество отраслей до произвольной величины, для которой можно собрать данные. Метод наполнил практическим содержанием теорию общего экономического равновесия. Он способствовал усовершенствованию математического аппарата путем определения новых коэффициентов, пригодных для создания динамических моделей реальной экономики, обеспечил совершенствование системы национальных счетов. Первоначальным этапом применения метода «затраты - выпуск» является изучение структуры, которая представляется в виде вектора структурных коэффициентов. Его содержание представляет количественные связи между затратами на производство и результатом работы каждого конкретного сектора. Экономический анализ связей представляют собой статистические данные за конкретный период в материально-вещественном выражении. В качестве примера используем приведенный самим В. Леонтьевым упрощенный трехсекторный баланс, который состоит из сельского хозяйства, промышленности и домашнего хозяйства. Всю продукцию сельского хозяйства предлагается привести к зерну, промышленности - к ткани, а домашнее хозяйство - к человеко-годам труда, табл. [6, с. 29]. Таблица 1 в из Сельское хозяйство Промышленность Домашнее хозяйство Общий выпуск Сельское хозяйство 24 20 55 100 бушелей зерна Промышленность 14 6 30 50 ярдов ткани Домашнее хозяйство 80 180 40 300 человеко-лет труда Оставдяем по такому же принципу стоимостной баланс в денежных единицах. Добавленная стоимость представлена дополнительной строкой. Она отражает заработную плату, амортизационные отчисления, налоги и прочие издержки, понесенные каждым предприятием в дополнение к платежам за ресурсы, поступившие из других отраслей. В последние годы В. Леонтьев все большее внимание уделял экономическим аспектам охраны окружающей среды. По его мнению, проблему охраны среды должно решать государство. Он предлагает включить в национальный доход альтернативную стоимость загрязнения окружающей среды, а затем эквивалент этой стоимости за счет добавки к цене посредством специального налога изымать у корпораций и направлять на восстановление окружающей среды. i Не можете найти то, что вам нужно?

В его исследованиях представлены потоки товаров и услуг из развитых стран и потоки природных ресурсов - из развивающихся стран, эти данные свидетельствуют о неравенстве в обмене. Товары развитых стран идут по монопольно высокой цене, а сырьевые ресурсы - по низкой, баланс обмена имеет крен в пользу развитых стран. Модель В. Леонтьева дает прочную основу государственного регулирования экономики посредством прогнозирования возможных путей развития экономики. В. Леонтьев писал: «Чтобы прогнозировать развитие экономики, нужен системный подход. Экономика каждой страны - это большая система, в которой много разных отраслей, и каждая из них что-то производит промышленные товары, услуги, которые передаются другим отраслям. Каждое звено, компонент системы может существовать только потому, что оно получает что-то от других». В вопросе о государственном бюджете он ратовал за четкое пополнение его доходной части посредством трех видов налогов: на доходы частных лиц и корпораций; на расходы продажи, акцизы, импортные тарифы; на собственность земля, дома и строения. Расходная часть бюджета должна быть направлена не только на удовлетворение чисто социальных потребностей, но и на решение экономических задач через государственные инвестиции в строительство дорог, портов, субсидирование продовольственных программ. Так, в США до 78% субсидий сельскому хозяйству шли на антикризисные программы по поддержке низких цен на продовольствие [1, с. 138]. В рамках социально-экономического прогнозирования развития территориальных систем представлено применение модели В. Леонтьева и метода «затраты -выпуск», которые способствовали усовершенствованию математического аппарата путем определения новых коэффициентов, пригодных для создания динамических моделей реальной экономики, а также проведение смежных исследований: анализ темпов и пропорций отдельных отраслей экономики, эффективность общественного производства, ценообразование, соотношение накопления и потребления, степень сбалансированности экономики. К сожалению, следует отметить, что до сих пор модель межотраслевого баланса использовалась в основном для анализа воспроизводственного процесса за прошедшие периоды как база для выработки стратегических вопросов [3, с. 29]. В перспективе будет рассмотрено применение модели В. Леонтьева в вопросах модернизации предпринимательской и деловой среды как одно из условий эффективной реализации социально-экономического потенциала региона [6, с. 328-367]. Заключение Согласно экономической теории, в экономике зачастую действуют устойчивые закономерности, поэтому в этом случае, возможно, их строго формализованное математическое описание. Однако разработка математических моделей чрезвычайно трудоемка, еще труднее создать достаточно адекватную математическую модель. Математическая в экономике замечательна тем, что она конструирует с заданной степенью точности идеальный экономический процесс и позволяет выявить его существенные свойства, которые в реальном объекте затемнены. Модель В. Леонтьева основана на алгебре матриц и использует аппарат матричного анализа для расчета связей между отраслями через выпуск и потребление разного рода. С ней тесно связана модель равновесных цен и модель международной торговли, а также вопросы использования трудовых ресурсов. Модель В. Леонтьева служит ярким примером применения математических методов в экономике. Особенность модели В. Леонтьева состоит в том, что число основных материальных и стоимостных потоков национального хозяйства не ограничено, все зависит от объема информации и необходимых вычислительных средств. Межотраслевой баланс производства и распределения общественного продукта с разбивкой на несколько сот отраслей составляется во многих странах мира, он позволяет оценивать пройденный экономикой путь и прогнозировать ее развитии. Масштабы использования метода «затраты - выпуск» реально оценивают достоинства и недостатки данного метода: Достоинства метода: - позволяет планировать отрасли системно с учетом места и веса каждой отрасли; - дает возможность планирования на ряд лет, позволяя найти пути подъема, как всей экономики страны, так и отдельных отраслей (например, успехи метода МОБ В. Леонтьева в развитии экономики таких стран, как Германии, Японии). Недостатки метода: - опора на матрицу коэффициентов полных затрат приводит к трудоемкому процессу сбора и обработки большого объема статистической информации; - процесс производится с периодичностью 5 лет, что не дает полной картины динамики отрасли; - нет учета технологических изменений в отраслях за период между сбором информации о матрице затрат","completion":"Метод межотраслевого баланса (МОБ), разработанный В. Леонтьевым, представляет собой важный инструмент анализа макроэкономического равновесия, позволяющий оценивать взаимозависимости между различными секторами экономики. Этот метод делает возможным всесторонний анализ экономических потоков, расчет макроэкономических показателей и прогнозирование развития экономики на основе детализированного изучения структуры производственных связей. Применение МОБ оказало значительное влияние на возможность государственного регулирования экономики, углубление понимания процессов обмена и распределения ресурсов как внутри одной страны, так и в международном контексте. Одним из ключевых преимуществ метода является его способность к комплексному анализу экономики, учитывающего как материальные, так и стоимостные потоки, что делает его незаменимым инструментом для планирования и прогнозирования экономического развития. Эта модель позволила углубить теорию общего экономического равновесия, обогатив ее математическим аппаратом для создания реалистичных динамических моделей. Однако, несмотря на свои достоинства и широкое практическое применение, метод межотраслевого баланса сталкивается с рядом ограничений и недостатков, таких как трудоемкость сбора и обработки данных, недостаточная гибкость в учете технологических изменений и динамики отраслей за периоды между обновлениями информационной базы. Эти проблемы требуют дальнейшего совершенствования методологии МОБ и разработки дополнительных инструментов для повышения точности и актуальности аналитических данных. В. Леонтьев открыл новые перспективы в анализе воспроизводственного процесса, предложив комплексный подход к изучению экономики, который позволяет не только возводить динамичные модели реальных экономических систем, но и применять их для эффективного прогнозирования и государственного регулирования экономических процессов. Таким образом, работа В. Леонтьева и его метод межотраслевого баланса остаются актуальными и важными для экономической науки и практики."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[민국이 밑으로 앞으로 얼마나 들어갈 건데, 겨우 5만 원에 복덩이 운운하는 거야. 이 철없는 엄마, 아빠야.] 내가 종알거리자, 아빠가 얼른 나를 안아 들었다. “우리 성국이 나날이 무거워지네. 성국아, 너도 이제 형이야. 알지?” [말 안 해도 안다고, 아빠야.] “자기야, 성국이도 보쌈 좀 먹여야겠어. 요즘 일이 많아서 성국이가 살이 빠지는 것 같아.” [뭔 소리야. 나 화면에 잘 나오려고 다이어트 중이었는데.] “그러게. 성국이 볼살이 확 줄었네. 우리 성국이 매력 포인트인데.” 아빠는 내 볼에 뽀뽀를 해댔다. [하아…. 사내끼리 이러는 거 아니야, 아빠야.] 엄마가 얼른 보쌈을 풀었다. 잘 익은 돼지고기에 보쌈김치가 먹음직스러웠다. 꼴깍. 저절로 침이 넘어갔다. 역시 아는 맛이 제일 무섭다. “성국이, 먹고 싶어?” “네!” 나는 고개를 끄덕이며 힘차게 대답했다.

[얼마 만에 먹어보는 아빠 보쌈이야. 여기엔 호주산 쉬라즈 와인이 제격인데. 캬아.] 나는 아쉬움을 달래며 보쌈 고기를 오물오물 씹어 넘겼다. 아빠는 어느새 보쌈을 싸서 엄마에게 내밀었다. “소영아, 애 둘 키우느라 고생 많아. 어서 먹어.” “자기가 먼저 먹어. 자기야말로 하루 종일 서서 요리하느라 힘들잖아.” “나야 여기서 일하는데, 자주 먹지.” 아빠는 웃으며 엄마 입에 보쌈을 밀어 넣었다. 그걸 또 엄마는 마지못해 받아먹었다. 어쨌든 가난해서 그렇지 금슬은 참 좋은 부부였다. 그러니 벌써 이 환경에서도 애가 둘이지. 나는 고개를 저었다. 회귀 전에 나에게 2세를 만드는 것은 거의 의무에 가까웠다. 정략결혼 한 와이프는 할아버지의 바람대로 대대로 국가 요직을 지낸 명문가의 여식이었다. 과학의 도움으로 미모도 나름 괜찮았고, 나와 대화가 될 정도로 공부도 좀 한 편이었다. 하지만 나는 행복하지 않았다. 정략결혼 한 사이라 와이프와 나 사이에는 벽이 있었고, 우리는 누구도 그 벽을 넘으려고 하지 않았다. 그래도 언제나 행복한 척, 와이프를 무척 사랑하는 척했다. 어차피 모든 조건을 맞춰서 결혼한 사이에 애정까지 바라는 것은 인간의 욕심이다. 나는 씁쓸한 얼굴로 갓 나기 시작한 어금니로 보쌈 고기를 씹었다. 엄마는 보쌈을 꿀꺽 삼키고는 조심스레 입을 열었다. “자기야….” “왜? 보쌈 맛없어?” “그게 아니라… 미영 언니가 그러는데. 성국이 광고 제의가 많이 들어온대. 특히 삼전 전자에서 전속 계약까지 이야기한다나 봐.” “전속 모델? 우리 성국이를?” “응. 삼전 전자 전속 모델 하면 성국이 학비도 마련되고 좋을 것 같다고. 조건도 좋대.” “그건 생각지 못한 거라서….” 아빠는 얼떨떨한 얼굴을 지었다. [내가 이렇게 잘나갈 줄은 둘 다 몰랐겠지?] 엄마가 아빠의 손을 잡았다. “자기야, 우리 성국이 커서 뭐가 될지 모르지만, 좋은 기회인 것 같아. 성국이 앞으로 저축해두면 성국이 우리처럼 어려워서 공부 못 하지는 않을 거잖아.” “그렇겠지만… 성국이가 너무 일을 많이 하는 것 같아서….” [아빠야, 그런 생각은 하는 거 아니야. 나 재벌일 때는 하루에 5시간 넘게 자본 게 손에 꼽아. 지금은 하루 12시간을 자잖아.] 내가 옹알거리자, 아빠는 얼른 야들야들한 보쌈을 입안에 밀어 넣었다. 나는 얼른 다시 보쌈삼매경에 빠졌다. [이딴 게 왜 이렇게 맛있는 거야.] 이미 입가는 침으로 축축했다. 엄마는 계속 아빠를 설득했다. “나는 생각해 보니까 진짜 좋은 기회 같거든. 자기만 오케이 하면 한번 만나보고 생각해보자. 성국이 생각보다 카메라 앞에 서는 것도 좋아하고, 진짜 성국이 앞으로 착실하게 저축해두면 성국이 하고 싶은 거 다 할 수 있잖아.” “그래, 와이프 말 들으면 자다가도 떡이 생긴다고 했는데. 나야 소영이 말 따라야지. 한번 만나서 이야기해 보지. 아직 결정된 건 아무것도 없잖아.” 아빠는 결심한 듯 이야기했다. * * * 전재형은 지금 삼전 전자의 온양 공장 착공 현장으로 가고 있었다. 대통령까지 내려오는 큰 자리였고, 회장인 아버지가 자숙 기간을 거쳐 다시 공식적인 자리에 처음으로 나오는 자리였다. 양 비서가 뒤를 흘끔 돌아봤다. “부회장님, 일전에 부탁하신 전성국 군 프로필 준비됐는데요.” “말해봐.” 양 비서는 브리핑을 시작했다. “성국이네 형편이 그리 좋은 편은 아닙니다. 성국이 아빠는 수유에 <원아저씨 보쌈>이라는 작은 보쌈집 주방에서 일하고, 그게 유일한 수입원이라고 합니다.” “얼마나 버는데?” “최근에 월급이 올라서 60만 원 정도 된다고 합니다.” “60만 원?” 전재형은 손가락으로 살짝 미간을 긁었다. 삼전 전자의 초봉은 100만 원 정도였다. 업계 최고이긴 했다. 월에 60만 원으로 네 가족이 살 수 있단 말이지…. 전재형은 상상도 할 수 없는 금액이었다. “성국이 엄마는 전업주부고요. 여상을 졸업하고 작은 회사의 경리로 일하다 아이를 가지는 바람에 그만뒀다고 합니다. 그리고 성국이 아빠랑 엄마 둘 다 같은 보육원에서 자란 고아입니다.” “보육원? 그럼, 고아라는 건가?” “네, 부회장님.” 양비서가 대답했다. 삼전 그룹 차원에서 고아들을 후원하고 있었지만, 행사 때 말고 고아를 본 적도 없는 게 전재형이었다. “흠…. 평판은?” “둘 다 좋습니다. 성국이 아빠는 매우 성실한 편이고, 책임감이 강해서 식당에서도 빨리 주방 일을 배웠다고 합니다. 성국이 엄마도 전에 일하던 회사나 고등학교 선생님들도 모두 칭찬하더라고요.” 전재형은 고개를 끄덕였다. “근데 부회장님, 성국이네에 대해서는 왜 이렇게 관심을 기울이시는 건지 여쭤도 될까요?” “아기를 전속 모델로 써서 그 성장에 맞춰 기업이 성장하는 이미지를 보여주는 계획이니까 아무래도 더 신경이 쓰이네. 아기야 어차피 세상사 모르는 일이고, 언제나 문제는 가족에게서 터지지 않나.” “현재 보증금 50만 원에 월세 5만 원짜리 수유역 근처 원룸에서 지내고 있다고 합니다. 성국 군의 매니저를 봐주는 사람은 김미영이라고 그 원룸 건물 주인이고요. 석 달 전까지 삼전 기획 경리과에서 근무했습니다. 성국이가 처음으로 출연한 삼전 전자 통돌이 세탁기에 추천한 사람이 바로 김미영이라고 합니다.” 전재형은 턱을 오른손 손가락으로 슬쩍 긁었다. 고민할 때 나오는 버릇이다. “김미영?” “여러 루트로 조사해본 결과, 성국이네와는 도움을 주고받는 사이입니다. 계약 조건도 다른 매니지먼트에 비해서 파격적으로 성국이에게 유리하고, 계약 기간도 성국이가 일을 그만둘 때 파기되는 조건이라고 합니다. 김미영은 삼전 기획에 유일하게 남아 있던 고졸 사원이었는데, 그 때문에 만년 과장이라 어쩔 수 없이 퇴사하고 이 일을 시작한 것 같습니다.” “혹 그 전성국이라는 아이, 내가 볼 수 있을까?” “자리 마련할까요?” “공식적인 만남 말고… 촬영하는 거 한번 보고 싶은데….” “알아보고 일정 잡겠습니다.” 양 비서는 난생처음 보는 전재형 부회장의 낯선 행보가 신경 쓰였지만, 우선은 입을 닫았다. 눈앞에 온양 표지판이 크게 들어왔다. * * * ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’의 마지막 촬영 날이었다. 어느새 6개월이 순식간에 흘렀다. <이별을 준비하는 하루>라는 부제가 달린 촬영이기도 했다. 나는 아침부터 이유식을 한 사발 거뜬하게 해치우고 부족한 배를 바나나로 달래고 있었다. ‘저스트’ 멤버들이 하나둘씩 내 곁으로 모여들었다. 리더인 태형이 나를 인자하게 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 너 오늘 무슨 날인지 알아?” [촬영 마지막 날이잖아. 뭘 또 물어?] “우리 성국이 보고 싶으면 어쩌지.” 엄마 역할을 충실히 해온 재현이 얼핏 눈물까지 보였다. 코는 이미 붉었다. [코 수술한 거 티 나. 그만 울어. 내일이면 잊을 거면서.] 마이클의 존재감이 줄어들면서 두각을 드러내기 시작한 범선이 내 손가락 하나를 잡았다. “우리 보고 싶으면 언제든 연락해.” [연락하면 씹을 거면서. 나도 다 안다고.] 나는 바나나를 야무지게 씹었다. 루카스는 연신 웃으며 내게 장난을 쳤고, 마이클은 똥 씹은 얼굴로 나를 바라봤다. 엄마의 출산일 이후로 내가 마이클을 철저히 무시하면서 마이클의 분량은 줄어들기 시작했다. 거기다 감독에게 찍힌 이후로 마이클의 유딩 이미지는 악동 이미지로 바뀌어서 시청자들의 비호감을 사기 시작했다. 자연스레 마이클의 분량은 점점 줄었고, 끝에서 병풍처럼 서 있는 경우도 많았다. 그 틈을 파고든 것이 듬직한 범선이었다. 잘생긴 얼굴에 츤데레 같은 성격이 여자 팬들을 긁어모았다. 나는 범선의 손을 꼭 잡았다. 미래를 본다면 그나마 가장 오랫동안 가수로, 배우로 성공적인 활약을 하는 멤버는 범선이었다. 원래 모든 인간관계는 그런 것이다. 달면 삼키고, 쓰면 뱉는다. 범선이 나를 지그시 내려다봤다. “성국이랑 정말 정 많이 들었는데, 아쉽네….” “그러게. 정말 이 녀석 덕분에 우리도 대박 났잖아.” 재현의 눈시울이 붉어졌다. 카메라는 이런 것까지 모두 담고 있었다. 눈시울이 붉어진 ‘저스트’ 멤버들 그리고 이별을 직감한 것 같은 나, 전성국. 나는 콘셉트에 맞게 시무룩한 얼굴로 멤버들을 쳐다봤다. 아마 내 얼굴 위로 이런 내레이션이 흐를 것이다. “이별을 직감한 성국이도 오늘은 영 힘이 없네요.” 이때, 리더인 태형이 뭔가 준비한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. [대본인가?] “얘들아, 우리 이번 2집 타이틀곡 성국이한테 골라달라고 하면 어때?” “성국이한테?” “응. 왜, 아이들이 리듬에 즉각적인 게 있잖아.” “난 찬성.” 범선이 제일 먼저 찬성했다. 마이클은 영 못미더운 얼굴이었다. “형, 노래 뭐 갖고 왔어?” “저번 주에 녹음한 <거짓이야>랑 <너에게 가는 길>, <사랑은 언제나 부족하다> 세 곡.” “뭐야. 거기 나 분량 엄청 작잖아.” “원래부터 이 세 곡 중에서 타이틀 뽑기로 했잖아. 그나마 네 분량 있는 <사랑은 언제나 부족하다>랑 <거짓이야> 밀어보자.” “성국이 얘 나 싫어해. 보나 마나 내 분량 제일 작은 걸로 뽑을 거야.” “성국이가 어떻게 그런 것까지 알아. 그냥 듣고 좋으면 좋다고 하겠지.” 태형이 마이클을 말렸지만, 마이클은 단단히 토라졌다. “감독님, 이 부분은 편집 부탁드려요.” “그래, 암튼 그 아이디어는 좋네. 성국이한테 한번 노래 들려줘보자.” “네.” 태형은 CD플레이어를 가지고 와서 준비했다. 난 들을 필요도 없었다. 내 원픽은 바로 <거짓이야>이다. 태형이 CD플레이어 버튼을 누를 듯 말 듯 긴장감 가득한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 이제부터 잘 들어봐. 다음 후속곡 골라줘.” “녜에!” 나는 손을 번쩍 들었다. 범선이 어느새 나를 안아 들었다. 곧 이어서 첫 번째 곡이 나왔다. <너에게 가는 길> [이건 두 번째 타이틀.] 다음 곡이 바로 <거짓이야>였다. 물론 나는 이것을 픽할 것이다. <거짓이야>는 인기가요톱10에서 무려 5주 연속 1위를 하는 영광을 누린다. “성국아, 이제 마지막 노래야.” [들을 필요도 없다고.] <사랑은 언제나 부족하다>는 나중에 수분을 채워준다는 이온 음료 광고 음악으로 쓰여서 뒤늦게 히트한다. 하지만 지금은 아니다. 태형은 세 노래를 다 들려주고 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 어떤 노래가 제일 좋아?” 나는 승리의 V 자를 들어 보였다.","completion":"Episode 15 Creak. This sound is of Dad coming home late at night, unlocking the front door with his key. Before I knew it, I had woken up, rubbing my sleepy eyes. Dad was shaking a bag of bossam (Korean boiled pork). \\"Sung-guk, are you awake?\\" [I'm so sensitive that I can't sleep without blackout curtains, and I swear no one within 100 meters can even breathe. Ah, what's the use of saying anything. Is it even real that four of us are breathing in this tiny one-room apartment…] \\"Sung-guk, Dad brought some bossam.\\" \\"Honey, why bossam?\\" \\"The boss gave it to us. Said it was a bonus for having a baby, gave us 50,000 won too.\\" \\"Wow, Min-guk is really a lucky charm.\\" I shook my head. [How much more do they expect to get ahead with just 50,000 won, calling it a lucky charm. These clueless mom and dad.] As I babbled, Dad quickly picked me up. \\"Our Sung-guk is getting heavier by the day. You know you're a big brother now, right?\\" [I know that without you saying, Dad.] \\"Honey, we should feed Sung-guk some bossam too. He seems to be losing weight with all the work these days.\\" [What are you talking about? I was on a diet to look good on screen.] \\"Right. Sung-guk's cheeks have gotten much thinner. His cheeks are his charm point.\\" Dad peppered my cheeks with kisses. [Sigh... Dad, men shouldn't be doing this.] Mom quickly unwrapped the bossam. The well-cooked pork and bossam kimchi looked delicious. Gulp. My saliva swallowed automatically. Indeed, the taste you know is the scariest. \\"Sung-guk, do you want to eat?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I nodded vigorously in response. [No, I'm on a diet.] Contrary to my thoughts, I found myself crawling towards the bossam as if enchanted. Mom tore off a piece of tender, fat-free bossam and pushed it into my mouth. [It's been a while since I've had Dad's bossam. A Shiraz from Australia would be perfect with this. Cheers.] I chewed and swallowed the bossam meat, consoling my longing. Dad had already wrapped some bossam and offered it to Mom. \\"So-young, you've worked hard raising two kids. Eat up.\\" \\"You eat first. You must be tired from standing and cooking all day.\\" \\"I eat here often enough.\\" Dad smiled and pushed the bossam into Mom's mouth. She reluctantly accepted and ate it. Despite being poor, they were a couple with a great relationship. That's why they already had two kids in this environment. I shook my head. Before regressing, having a second child was almost a duty for me. My wife, arranged through a political marriage, was a daughter from a prestigious family that had held national key positions for generations, as my grandfather wished. With the help of science, she was quite beautiful, and she was educated enough to converse with me. But I was not happy. There was a wall between my wife and me due to our arranged marriage, and neither of us tried to overcome it. Still, I always pretended to be happy, pretending to love my wife very much. After all, expecting affection in a marriage arranged to meet all conditions is human greed. I chewed the bossam meat with my newly grown molars, making a bitter face. Mom swallowed the bossam and cautiously opened her mouth. \\"Honey…\\" \\"What? Is the bossam not good?\\" \\"It's not that… Mi-young told me. Sung-guk has received a lot of commercial offers. Especially, Samsung Electronics is talking about an exclusive contract.\\" \\"Exclusive model? Our Sung-guk?\\" \\"Yes. They said it would be good for Sung-guk's school fees and the conditions are good.\\" \\"I hadn't thought about that….\\" Dad looked bewildered. [Neither of you would have thought I'd do so well, right?] Mom held Dad's hand. \\"Honey, we don't know what Sung-guk will become, but it seems like a good opportunity. If we save for Sung-guk's future, he won't have to struggle with his studies like us.\\" \\"That's true, but… it seems like Sung-guk is working too much….\\" [Dad, you shouldn't be thinking like that. When I was a chaebol, I barely slept over 5 hours a day. Now I sleep 12 hours a day.] As I babbled, Dad quickly stuffed tender bossam into my mouth. I immediately fell back into the bossam trance. [Why is this so delicious?] My mouth was already wet with saliva. Mom continued to persuade Dad. \\"I've been thinking, and it really seems like a good opportunity. If you're okay with it, let's meet and think about it. Sung-guk seems to like being in front of the camera, and if we save diligently for the future, Sung-guk can do whatever he wants.\\" \\"Alright, they say you gain rice cakes even in your dreams if you listen to your wife. I should follow So-young's words. Let's meet and talk. Nothing's been decided yet.\\" Dad seemed to have made up his mind. * * * Jeon Jae-hyung was on his way to the groundbreaking ceremony of Samsung Electronics' Onyang factory. It was a big event with even the President attending, and it was the first official appearance of his father, the chairman, after a period of self-reflection. Secretary Yang glanced back. \\"Vice Chairman, I've prepared the profile of Jeon Sung-guk as you requested.\\" \\"Tell me.\\" \\"Things aren't very good for Sung-guk's family. Sung-guk's dad works in the kitchen of a small bossam restaurant called 'Mr. Won's Bossam,' and that's their only source of income.\\" \\"How much does he earn?\\" \\"His salary recently increased to about 600,000 won.\\" \\"600,000 won?\\" Jeon Jae-hyung slightly scratched his forehead with his finger. The starting salary at Samsung Electronics was about 1 million won. It was the highest in the industry. Living with a family of four on 600,000 won a month…. Jeon Jae-hyung couldn't even imagine such an amount. \\"Sung-guk's mom is a full-time housewife. She graduated from a commercial high school and worked as an accountant at a small company, but she quit after having a child. Both Sung-guk's dad and mom grew up in the same orphanage.\\" \\"Orphanage? So, they're orphans?\\" \\"Yes, Vice Chairman.\\" Secretary Yang answered. Although Samsung Group supported orphans, Jeon Jae-hyung had never seen an orphan outside of events. \\"Hmm…. What about their reputation?\\" \\"Both are good. Sung-guk's dad is very diligent and responsible, quickly learning kitchen work at the restaurant. Sung-guk's mom also received praise from her previous workplace and high school teachers.\\" Jeon Jae-hyung nodded. \\"But Vice Chairman, may I ask why you're paying so much attention to Sung-guk's family?\\" \\"I'm planning to use the baby as an exclusive model to show the company's growth alongside his growth. After all, babies don't know anything about the world, and problems always arise from the family.\\" \\"Currently, they live in a one-room near Suyu Station with a deposit of 500,000 won and a monthly rent of 50,000 won. Kim Mi-young, who looks after Sung-guk's management, is the owner of that building. She worked in Samsung's planning and accounting department until three months ago. Kim Mi-young is the one who recommended Sung-guk for his first appearance in a Samsung Electronics washing machine commercial.\\" Jeon Jae-hyung slightly scratched his chin with his right hand's fingers, a habit when he was pondering. \\"Kim Mi-young?\\" \\"After investigating through various channels, it seems they help each other. The contract conditions are exceptionally favorable for Sung-guk compared to other management companies, and the contract is terminated when Sung-guk decides to quit working. Kim Mi-young was the only high school graduate left in Samsung's planning department, and it seems she had to resign and start this work because she was stuck as a permanent manager.\\" \\"Can I see this Jeon Sung-guk?\\" \\"Should I arrange a meeting?\\" \\"Not an official meeting… I'd like to see him filming….\\" \\"I'll look into it and schedule it.\\" Secretary Yang was concerned about Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's unusual move but kept quiet for now. The Onyang signboard came into view. * * * It was the last day of filming for 'Five Men and a Baby Basket.' In the blink of an eye, 6 months had passed. The shooting was also titled <Preparing for Farewell>. I had devoured a bowl of baby food since morning and was soothing my still-hungry stomach with a banana. The members of 'Just' gathered around me one by one. The leader, Tae-hyung, looked at me kindly. \\"Sung-guk, do you know what day it is today?\\" [I know it's the last day of filming. Why ask?] \\"What if we miss our Sung-guk?\\" Jae-hyun, who had faithfully played the role of a mother, seemed to have tears in his eyes. His nose was already red. [Your nose job is showing. Stop crying. You'll forget by tomorrow.] As Michael's presence diminished, Beom-seon, who began to stand out, held one of my fingers. \\"Call us anytime if you miss us.\\" [You'll ignore my calls. I know everything.] I chewed the banana vigorously. Lucas kept making me laugh with his jokes, while Michael looked at me with a sour face. After my mother's delivery, I completely ignored Michael, leading to a reduction in his screen time. Furthermore, after being marked by the director, Michael's image changed from a youth to a troublemaker, starting to gather dislike from viewers. Naturally, Michael's screen time decreased, and he often ended up standing in the background like a folding screen. Beom-seon, who took advantage of this situation, had a handsome face and a tsundere personality, attracting female fans. I held Beom-seon's hand tightly. If I could see the future, Beom-seon would be the member who enjoys the longest success as a singer and actor. After all, human relationships are like that. Swallow when it's sweet, spit it out when it's bitter. Beom-seon looked down at me intently. \\"I've grown really attached to Sung-guk, it's a shame…\\" \\"Right. Thanks to this guy, we hit the jackpot.\\" Jae-hyun's eyes reddened. The camera captured all of this. The 'Just' members with teary eyes and me, Jeon Sung-guk, sensing the farewell. I made a sullen face to fit the concept. Probably, a narration like this would flow over my face. \\"Sung-guk, sensing the farewell, seems to have no energy today.\\" Then, Tae-hyung, the leader, looked at me with a prepared face. [Is it scripted?] \\"Guys, how about we let Sung-guk choose our next title song for the 2nd album?\\" \\"Sung-guk?\\" \\"Yeah. You know, kids have an immediate sense of rhythm.\\" \\"I agree.\\" Beom-seon was the first to agree. Michael was clearly displeased. \\"Hyung, what songs did you bring?\\" \\"The ones we recorded last week, <It's a Lie>, <The Way to You>, and <Love is Always Lacking>, three songs.\\" \\"What? My part is so small in those.\\" \\"We were going to pick the title from these three songs anyway. Let's push for <Love is Always Lacking> and <It's a Lie> where you have more parts.\\" \\"Sung-guk hates me. He'll definitely pick the one where I have the least part.\\" \\"How would Sung-guk know that? He'll just say it's good if he likes it.\\" Tae-hyung stopped Michael, but Michael was clearly upset. \\"Director, please edit this part out.\\" \\"Anyway, that idea is good. Let's play the songs for Sung-guk.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Tae-hyung brought the CD player and prepared it. I didn't need to listen. My pick is <It's a Lie>. Tae-hyung, with a tense face, looked at me as if he was about to press the CD player button. \\"Sung-guk, listen carefully from now on. Choose the next follow-up song.\\" \\"Yes!\\" I raised my hand high. Beom-seon had already picked me up. Soon, the first song played. <The Way to You> [This is the second title.] The next song was <It's a Lie>. Of course, I would pick this. <It's a Lie> would enjoy the glory of being number 1 on Music Bank for 5 consecutive weeks. \\"Sung-guk, this is the last song.\\" [I don't need to listen.] <Love is Always Lacking> would later be used as a background song for an electrolyte drink commercial, becoming a hit later. But not now. Tae-hyung played all three songs and looked at me. \\"Sung-guk, which song do you like the most?\\" I showed a victory V sign."},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[미심쩍은가 보군. 그렇다면!] 나는 <거짓이야>가 나올 때 애절한 눈빛으로 엉덩이를 좌로 세 번, 우로 세 번 흔들다가 클라이맥스 때는 범선의 다리를 붙잡고 엉엉 울기까지 했다. 멤버들 역시 눈시울이 붉어졌다. 아마 이 모습 아래에는 이런 자막이 달릴 것이다. - 성국이가 형들과의 헤어짐을 노래로 달래봅니다. 그나저나 ‘저스트’ 2집은 대박 예감이네요. “컷!” 감독이 소리를 지르자, 여운이 남은 멤버들이 붉어진 눈시울을 꾹꾹 눌렀다. “성국이는 잠시 쉬고, 저스트 멤버들만 남아서 촬영 시작입니다!” 스태프가 나를 밖으로 안내했다. 김미영과 대화를 나누는 소리가 들렸다. “성국이 생일 서프라이즈 하려고요. 멤버들이 케이크도 직접 만들고, 상도 직접 차릴 거예요.” [하아….] 나는 속으로 깊은 한숨을 쉬었다. 아침부터 내 눈앞에서 생일 서프라이즈 한다고 소품 들고 돌아다닐 때부터 다 알고 있었다. 마지막 촬영의 방송일은 두 달 후쯤 내 생일 전후라 그날에 맞춰서 촬영하기 때문이다. 나는 정말 심각한 고민에 빠졌다. [어떻게 놀라는 척하지?] 나는 머릿속으로 놀랄 표정과 포즈를 정리했다. 우선 눈을 동그랗게 떠야 할 것 같고, 곧 눈물도 터트릴 준비 좀 해야 할 것 같았다. “얼마 정도 기다리면 될까요?” “적어도 2시간 정도는 걸릴 것 같은데요. 차에서 쉬고 계세요.” “네, 그럴게요.” 김미영은 나를 안고 차에서 기다리는 엄마에게 갔다. * * * 7월이라 햇살이 뜨거웠다. “성국이 엄마, 촬영 준비 좀 오래 걸릴 것 같다고 조연출이 그러네요.” “언니, 그럼 차에서 쉴까요?” 김미영이 다른 제안을 했다. “성국이도 답답할 거 같은데, 공원 갈래요? 5분만 걸어가면 작은 공원 있어요. 어때요?” “잘됐네요. 성국이도 좀 걸으면 좋을 것 같아요.” 나는 이제 제법 능숙하게 공원을 향해 걸었다. 다리에 힘도 많이 생겼고, 혀 놀림도 점점 더 좋아졌다. “성국아, 천천히 가.” 나는 잠시 뒤를 돌아보곤 다시 직진을 선택했다. 뒤에서 엄마와 김미영이 나를 뒤따라오며 이야기를 나눴다. “참, 광고는 생각해 봤어요?” “삼전 전자 전속이요?” “네.” “남편이랑 상의해 봤는데, 남편도 아무래도 삼전 전자 전속이면 성국이가 편하게 일할 수 있을 것 같다고 긍정적으로 생각해 보재요.” 김미영이 고개를 끄덕였다. “좋은 결정이에요. 나도 삼전 기획 다녔지만, 모델들에게는 최고로 대우해주는 회사예요. 그럼, 삼전 전자 쪽에 긍정적으로 대답할게요.” “언니가 민국이 봐줄 아주머니도 구해주셔서 성국이 마지막 촬영에도 나오고, 정말 고마워요.” 민국이 녀석 떼준 것은 나도 고마웠다. 나는 부른 배를 꺼트릴 겸 열심히 앞으로 걸어갔다. 이때, 저 멀리에 익숙한 차 한 대가 보였다. 독일의 장인이 특수 제작한 대한민국에 딱 한 대밖에 없는 자동차. 바로 삼전 그룹 전재형 부회장의 차량이었다. 나는 우뚝 멈춰 섰다. 설마 나를 보러 온 건가. * * * 전재형은 창문 너머로 아장아장 걸어오는 성국이를 바라봤다. 잠시 광고 촬영장에서 스치긴 했지만, 제대로 보는 것은 이번이 처음이었다. ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’를 본 이후로 전재형의 머릿속에는 성국이란 아이의 존재가 각인됐다. 또랑또랑한 눈빛. 야무진 행동. 가난한 집에서 태어났지만, 사랑을 독차지하는 존재. 전재형에게는 이미 아들과 딸이 있었고, 밝혀진 혼외자도 한 명 더 있었지만, 그들에게는 이런 기분을 받은 적이 없었다. 왠지 모르게 자신보다는 와이프를 많이 닮았고, 이제 슬슬 공부로 두각을 드러내야 하는 여덟 살 태국이나 다섯 살 미진이 모두 성과가 좋지 못했다. 혼외자도 마찬가지였다. 아이를 한 명 더 낳을 수만 있다면 좋겠지만, 더는 족보를 복잡하게 만들고 싶지도 않았고 와이프랑 잠자리를 하기는 더 싫었다. 하지만 성국이는 마치 자신의 어릴 때 모습을 보듯 영특했다. 양 비서가 뒤돌아봤다. “매니저 통해서 멀리서 보겠다고는 했습니다.” “흠… 직접 볼까.” 전재형은 말이 끝나는 동시에 차 문을 열고 나갔다. * * * 나는 검은 차로 힘차게 걸어갔다. 회귀 전의 아버지를 한 번 제대로 보고 싶었기 때문이다. 1993년이면 아버지는 아마 40대 초반일 것이다. 직위는 부회장일 테고…. 5년 후에 할아버지가 갑자기 심장마비로 사망하면서 할아버지의 자리를 물려받는다. 이 시절의 아버지는 나에게 무섭고, 반갑지 않은 존재였다. 우선 철의 여인과 말 한 마디 하지 않았고, 멍청한 동생들 대신 내게 많은 기대를 걸었다. 아버지가 살가운 적은 딱 한 번 있었다. 내가 중학교 입학시험에서 서울 지역 1등을 한 때였다. 이건 내 노력으로 달성한 눈에 보이는 최초의 성과였다. 그만큼 아버지는 성과 지상주의였다. 회사도, 여자도, 자식도. 덜컥. 차 뒷문이 열렸다. 나는 순간 멈춰 섰다. [설마?] 열린 뒷문으로 아버지 전재형이 나오고 있었다. 목으로 침이 꿀꺽 넘어갔다. 광고 촬영장에서 본 회귀 전 아버지를 이렇게 가까이 보다니. 온몸이 얼어붙었지만, 머리는 쉴 새 없이 돌아갔다. [무슨 이야기를 해야만 할 것 같은데….] 나는 태양 아래에서 회귀 전의 아버지와 마주 보고 섰다. 아버지가 천천히 내게로 다가왔다. 입가에는 평소 볼 수 없었던 미소가 어려 있었다. 나는 순간 긴장이 풀리면서 입을 열었다. “아. 빠?” 그 순간, 전재형도 멈칫 섰다. 저 단순한 말 한 마디가 심장을 가격했다. [아차.] 나는 바로 실수를 깨달았다. 전재형 부회장이 계산 없이 움직이는 일은 없었다. 삼전 전자에서 광고 제의가 왔다고 하더니, 분명 나를 한 번 직접 눈으로 보고 확인하려는 모양이었다. 이번 생에서 우리는 남이다. 앞으로 나는 그렇게 살아갈 것이다. 나는 통통한 등을 보이며 엄마에게 걸어갔다. 엄마는 얼른 나를 안아 들고 인사를 했다. “어머, 죄송합니다.” “애가 저 때문에 놀란 거 아니죠?” 삼전 전자 부회장 전재형은 온화한 미소를 지었다. “아니에요. 오히려 저희 애 때문에 놀라셨죠?” “혹시 이 애가 그 방송 나오는 애인가요?” 전재형은 천천히 내게 다가왔다. 나는 심장이 두근거렸다. “아, 네. ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’ 맞아요.” 엄마는 아무것도 모른 채 기쁘게 대답했다. 지금 아버지는 모든 것을 다 알고 와 있는 게 분명했다. [아버지가 일개 아기 모델까지 관리한 기억은 없는데….] 나는 정신을 다잡았다. 잠시 알 수 없는 울컥함에 아버지의 바지를 잡고 침을 흘릴 뻔했다. “아기가 예쁘네요. 근데 아가야.” 아버지가 나를 바라봤다. “아까 나보고 아빠라고 한 거야?” “…….” 나는 입을 꾹 다물었다. 나도 모르게 터져 나온 말이었다. “죄송합니다. 얘가 요즘 엄마, 아빠라고 말을 잘하거든요.” 엄마는 연신 사과를 했고, 김미영은 한 발 뒤에 물러서 있었다. 이 상황은 아무래도 삼전 쪽에서 만든 것 같았다. 김미영도 이미 아는 눈치였다. 아버지는 미소를 지으며 지갑에서 만 원짜리 하나를 꺼내 내밀었다. “아저씨가 놀라게 해서 미안. 맛있는 거 사먹어.” “아니에요. 괜찮습니다.” 엄마는 미안해하며 사양을 했다. “안 받으면 제가 죄송해서 안 돼요.” 나는 얼른 만 원을 집었다. 아버지에게 만 원이야 없어도 그만인 돈이었다. “착하네. 그럼, 또 보자.” 아버지는 의미심장한 말을 남기고 차에 올랐다. 김미영이 얼른 다가왔다. “성국이 엄마, 이제 슬슬 다시 촬영하러 가봐요. 시간이 많이 흘렀어요.” “어머, 그러네요.” 엄마는 내 손을 잡고 다시 촬영장으로 향했다. 나는 최대한 냉정한 등을 전재형 부회장에게 보였다. 뒤도 돌아보지 않았다. 이번 생에서 전재형 부회장과 나는 피 한 방울 안 섞인 남에 불과했다. * * * 내가 ‘저스트’ 숙소의 문을 열자, 어둠 속에서 두 개의 초가 빛나며 다가왔다. 리더 태형이 내 생일 케이크를 들고 있었다. 동시에 생일을 축하하는 노래가 반지하 숙소에 울려 퍼졌다. “생일 축하합니다. 생일 축하합니다. 사랑하는 우리 성국이의 생일 축하합니다.” ‘저스트’ 멤버들은 모두 입을 모아 내 생일을 축하했다. 동시에 환호가 터졌다. 불이 켜지면서 스태프들도 모두 나를 향해 박수를 쳤다. [이러니 꼭 회귀 전 열두 살 생일로 돌아간 거 같네.] 나는 잠시 그 시절을 회상했다. 열두 살 생일에 ‘저스트’가 와서 축하 노래를 불러줬다. 달라진 게 있다면, 가사 정도였다. 사랑하는 우리 성국이가 아니라 그땐 사랑하는 우리 도련님이었다. 어쨌든 회귀 전의 기억도 떠오르고, 다시 ‘저스트’의 축하를 받다니 흐뭇했다. 나는 격하게 손바닥을 쳤다. “성국아, 소원 빌고 초 불어야지.” “네에!” 나는 손을 번쩍 들었다. 그리고 잠시 눈을 감았다. 내 소원은 간단했다. [이번 생에는 삼전 그룹 눌러버리는 재벌 되게 해 주세요!] 나는 얼른 눈을 뜨고 두 개의 빛나는 초를 있는 힘껏 불었다. “후우-!” * * * 광화문에 위치한 삼전 전자 본사 회의실은 정말 오랜만이었다. 나는 감회에 찬 눈으로 주변을 둘러봤다. [이게 얼마 만이야.] 물론 1993년 삼전 전자를 내가 잘 알진 못하지만, 10년 후의 이곳은 내가 잘 안다. 삼전 전자는 2000년대 초반까지 삼전 그룹의 핵심 사업 분야 중 하나였다. 나는 오래간만에 익숙한 곳에서 편안하게 마들렌을 들고 녹여 먹었다. 날 위해 준비한 간식이었다. 그에 반해 긴장한 기색이 역력한 것은 아빠와 김미영이었다. 계약 관련 일이라 아빠가 쉬는 날에 특별히 약속 시간을 잡았다. 아무래도 아버지가 나를 보러 왔던 것은 이번 계약 건 때문인 것 같았다. 아빠가 잠깐 눈치를 보더니 김미영을 쳐다봤다. “삼전 전자 본사 와보신 적 있어요?” “저도 처음이에요. 미리 계약서는 봤으니, 서로 몇 가지만 잘 조율하면 될 것 같아요. 성국이 아버님, 너무 긴장하지 마세요.” “그게 말처럼 안 되네요. 저 같은 사람은 이런 건물 근처에 와본 적도 없거든요.” 달칵. 회의실의 문이 열렸다. 그리고 문 사이로 양 비서가 얼굴을 내밀었다. [양 비서 아저씨!] 나는 양 비서를 향해 손을 흔들었다. 나를 모시던 양 비서의 아버지지만, 어릴 적에는 양 비서가 나에 대한 모든 것을 케어했다. 양 비서는 부모님 몰래 과외를 째고 동급생 여자 친구와 놀이공원에 데려다 주기도 했다. 물론 이건 나와 양 비서만 아는 비밀이었다. 양 비서가 온화한 미소를 지으며 고개를 숙였다. “안녕하세요, 처음 뵙겠습니다. 부회장님을 모시는 양 비서라고 합니다.” 순간, 난 고개를 갸웃했다. 일개 삼전 전자의 모델 계약을 하는데, 양 비서가 직접 나선다고? 양 비서의 존재는 그룹 내에서 전재형 부회장의 대리라는 게 정설이다. 그 말인즉슨, 양 비서가 하는 모든 공적인 활동이나 말은 전재형 부회장의 지시와 동일하다는 의미였다. 양 비서가 생각에 빠진 내 머리를 쓰다듬었다. “성국 군 많이 컸네요.” “이제 두 돌 됐어요.” 아빠는 재빨리 대답했다. “방송은 이제 얼마 남았죠?” “촬영은 다 끝났는데, 방송은 한 달 정도 더 나간다고 들었습니다.” ‘다섯 남자와 아기 바구니’는 박수 칠 때 떠나라는 말처럼 가장 인기 있을 때 종영하기로 했다. 물론 이건 대외적인 발표이다. 사실은 마이클이 계속 걸렸기 때문이다. 민국이 출산 이후로 촬영장에서 카메라가 꺼질 때마다 멤버들은 마이클 때문에 작은 말싸움이 났고, 사이는 악화됐다. 아무래도 이번 생에서는 ‘저스트’는 국민 아이돌이 되지 못할지도 모르겠다. 양 비서는 맞은편에 자리를 잡았다. 커피를 한 모금 마시더니 아빠와 김미영을 번갈아 쳐다봤다. “아버님, 어떻게, 계약 조건 만족하시나요?”","completion":"Episode 16 \\"Second?\\" \\"Yes!\\" Michael seemed to be in a slightly better mood as well. This was because Michael had a significant amount of rap parts in \\"It's a Lie.\\" \\"Then, shall we push 'It's a Lie' to the CEO?\\" \\"I always liked 'It's a Lie' the best.\\" When Beomseon answered, the other members nodded in agreement. \\"Bro, let's listen to it again with Sungguk.\\" \\"Should we?\\" At Lucas's suggestion, Taehyung played the song again. [You seem skeptical. Then!] When \\"It's a Lie\\" played, I shook my hips three times to the left and three times to the right with a longing look in my eyes, and at the climax, I grabbed Beomseon's leg and cried my eyes out. The members' eyes reddened as well. Probably, the following caption would appear below this scene. - Sungguk tries to soothe the separation from his brothers with a song. By the way, 'Just's' second album is a hit sensation. \\"Cut!\\" When the director shouted, the members pressed their reddened eyes. \\"Sungguk, take a break. Just the members of 'Just' will start filming!\\" The staff led me outside. I heard Kim Miyoung talking. \\"We're planning a birthday surprise for Sungguk. The members are making the cake themselves and setting up the table.\\" [Haah....] I sighed deeply inside. I knew they were planning a birthday surprise in front of me since the morning when they were carrying props around. The last day of filming is broadcast around my birthday two months later, so it's scheduled to match that day. I was seriously worried. [How should I pretend to be surprised?] I organized surprised expressions and poses in my head. I thought I should open my eyes wide and prepare to burst into tears soon. \\"How long should I wait?\\" \\"It might take at least 2 hours. Please rest in the car.\\" \\"Okay, I will.\\" Kim Miyoung went to my mom waiting in the car. * * * It was July, and the sunlight was hot. \\"Sungguk's mom, the assistant director says the preparation might take a while.\\" \\"Sister, shall we rest in the car?\\" Kim Miyoung made another suggestion. \\"Sungguk might feel stuffy too, how about going to the park? There's a small park just a 5-minute walk away. How about it?\\" \\"That sounds good. It might be nice for Sungguk to walk a bit.\\" I walked towards the park quite adeptly. My legs had grown stronger, and my speech had improved. \\"Sungguk, go slowly.\\" I looked back for a moment and then chose to go straight again. Mom and Kim Miyoung followed me, talking. \\"Have you thought about the advertisement?\\" \\"The exclusive for Samjeon Electronics?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"I discussed it with my husband, and he also thinks it would be comfortable for Sungguk to work if it's an exclusive contract with Samjeon Electronics.\\" Kim Miyoung nodded. \\"That's a good decision. I've worked at Samjeon's planning department, and it's a company that treats its models the best. Then, I'll respond positively to Samjeon Electronics.\\" \\"I'm really grateful that you found a lady to look after Minguk so Sungguk could come to the last filming.\\" I was also grateful that Minguk was taken care of. I walked forward diligently to relieve my full stomach. Then, I saw a familiar car in the distance. A car specially made by a German craftsman, the only one in South Korea. It was the car of Samjeon Group's Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. I stopped in my tracks. Could he have come to see me? * * * Jeon Jae-hyung looked through the window at Sungguk walking towards him. Although they had briefly crossed paths at the advertisement filming site, this was the first time he had properly seen him. Since watching 'Five Men and a Baby Basket,' Sungguk had been imprinted in Jeon Jae-hyung's mind. Bright eyes. Determined actions. Born into a poor family but monopolizing love. Jeon Jae-hyung already had a son and a daughter, and there was another child from an extramarital affair, but he had never felt this way about them. Somehow, they resembled his wife more, and both eight-year-old Taeguk and five-year-old Mijin, who should be starting to stand out in their studies, were not doing well. The child from the affair was the same. If only he could have another child, but he didn't want to complicate the family tree further or share a bed with his wife. But Sungguk seemed clever, like a younger version of himself. Secretary Yang turned around. \\"I told the manager we'd watch from afar.\\" \\"Hmm... Shall we see him in person?\\" Jeon Jae-hyung opened the car door as he finished speaking. * * * I walked energetically towards the black car. I wanted to see my father from before the regression properly. If it's 1993, my father would probably be in his early 40s. His position would be vice chairman... And 5 years later, when my grandfather suddenly dies of a heart attack, he takes over his position. At that time, my father was a scary and unwelcome presence to me. Firstly, he didn't speak a word to the iron lady, and instead of my foolish siblings, he placed a lot of expectations on me. There was only one time when my father was affectionate. It was when I ranked first in Seoul on my middle school entrance exam. It was the first visible achievement I had made through my efforts. To that extent, my father was a performance supremacist. In everything - the company, women, children. Click. The car's back door opened. I stopped for a moment. [Could it be?] Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was getting out of the car. I swallowed hard. Seeing my pre-regression father so close at the advertisement filming site. My body froze, but my mind was racing. [I feel like I should say something...] Under the sun, I stood facing my pre-regression father. Father slowly approached me, a smile on his face that I had never seen before. At that moment, I relaxed and opened my mouth. \\"Dad?\\" At that moment, Jeon Jae-hyung also paused. That simple word struck his heart. [Oops.] I immediately realized my mistake. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung never acted without calculation. It seemed he came to see me in person because of the advertisement offer from Samjeon Electronics. In this life, we are strangers. I will live like that from now on. I turned my chubby back and walked towards my mom. Mom quickly picked me up and greeted him. \\"Oh, I'm sorry.\\" \\"The child wasn't startled because of me, was he?\\" Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung of Samjeon Electronics smiled warmly. \\"No, if anything, we were startled because of your child.\\" \\"Is this child the one from the show?\\" Jeon Jae-hyung slowly approached me. My heart raced. \\"Yes, it's 'Five Men and a Baby Basket.'\\" Mom happily answered, unaware of anything. Right now, father must know everything. [I don't remember father managing even a baby model in my previous life...] I composed myself. For a moment, I almost grabbed father's pants and drooled. \\"The baby is cute. But, little one.\\" Father looked at me. \\"Did you call me dad earlier?\\" \\"...\\" I kept my mouth shut. It was an unintentional slip. \\"I'm sorry. He's been saying mom and dad a lot lately.\\" Mom apologized repeatedly, and Kim Miyoung stood a step back. It seemed like Samjeon had arranged this situation. Kim Miyoung seemed to know already. Father smiled and took out a ten-thousand-won note from his wallet. \\"I'm sorry for startling you. Buy something delicious.\\" \\"No, it's okay.\\" Mom declined, feeling sorry. \\"If you don't take it, I'll feel bad.\\" I quickly grabbed the ten thousand won. To father, ten thousand won was nothing. \\"Good boy. Then, see you again.\\" Father left a meaningful message and got into the car. Kim Miyoung quickly approached. \\"Sungguk's mom, let's go back to filming. It's been a while.\\" \\"Oh, right.\\" Mom held my hand and headed back to the filming site. I showed my calmest back to Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. I didn't look back. In this life, Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung and I are nothing more than strangers. * * * As I opened the door to 'Just's' dorm, two candles approached me in the dark. Leader Taehyung was holding my birthday cake. At the same time, a birthday song echoed in the semi-basement dorm. \\"Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Sungguk. Happy birthday to you.\\" The 'Just' members all sang my birthday song together. Cheers erupted. The lights turned on, and the staff also clapped for me. [It feels like I've returned to my twelfth birthday before the regression.] I reminisced about that time for a moment. On my twelfth birthday, 'Just' came and sang a birthday song for me. The only difference was the lyrics. Back then, it was \\"dear young master\\" instead of \\"dear Sungguk.\\" Anyway, it was heartwarming to recall the memories before the regression and to receive 'Just's' celebration again. I clapped my hands vigorously. \\"Sungguk, make a wish and blow out the candles.\\" \\"Yes!\\" I raised my hand high. And I closed my eyes for a moment. My wish was simple. [Please let me become a conglomerate that crushes Samjeon Group in this life!] I quickly opened my eyes and blew out the two shining candles with all my might. \\"Whoo-!\\" * * * It had been a long time since I was in the Samjeon Electronics headquarters meeting room in Gwanghwamun. I looked around with a sense of nostalgia. [How long has it been?] Of course, I didn't know much about Samjeon Electronics in 1993, but I knew this place well 10 years later. Samjeon Electronics was one of the core business areas of Samjeon Group until the early 2000s. I comfortably ate Madeleines prepared for me, feeling at ease in a familiar place for the first time in a while. On the other hand, my dad and Kim Miyoung were visibly nervous. It was a contract-related matter, so my dad had specially arranged a meeting time on his day off. It seemed that father's visit was indeed because of this contract matter. Dad glanced around for a moment and then looked at Kim Miyoung. \\"Have you ever been to Samjeon Electronics headquarters?\\" \\"It's my first time too. We've seen the contract in advance, so it seems we just need to fine-tune a few things. Sungguk's dad, don't be too nervous.\\" \\"It's easier said than done. People like me have never even been near a building like this.\\" Click. The meeting room door opened. And Secretary Yang peeked his face through the door. [Secretary Yang!] I waved at Secretary Yang. He was the father of the Secretary Yang who took care of me, but when I was young, Secretary Yang took care of everything about me. Secretary Yang even secretly took me to the amusement park with a girl classmate, skipping tutoring without my parents knowing. Of course, this was a secret only Secretary Yang and I knew. Secretary Yang smiled warmly and bowed his head. \\"Hello, nice to meet you. I'm Secretary Yang, serving the Vice Chairman.\\" For a moment, I tilted my head. Why would Secretary Yang personally get involved in a simple model contract for Samjeon Electronics? Secretary Yang's presence is known within the group as the proxy of Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. That means, every public activity or word from Secretary Yang is equivalent to an order from Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. Secretary Yang patted my head, lost in thought. \\"Sungguk has grown a lot.\\" \\"He's just turned two.\\" Dad quickly answered. \\"How much longer is the broadcast?\\" \\"The filming is finished, but I heard it will air for about one more month.\\" 'Five Men and a Baby Basket' decided to end at its peak popularity, as the saying goes, \\"Leave when the applause is loudest.\\" Of course, this was the official announcement. In reality, it was because of Michael. Since Minguk's birth, small arguments broke out among the members off-camera due to Michael, and their relationship worsened. It seems that in this life, 'Just' might not become the national idols. Secretary Yang took a seat opposite us. After taking a sip of coffee, he looked back and forth between my dad and Kim Miyoung. \\"Dad, are you satisfied with the contract terms?\\""},{"prompt":"Write a story, set in the Zootopia universe in the year 1999, about a teenage Nick Wilde getting arrested and being sent to a juvy. Nick ends up meeting a teenage Finnick in the juvy for the first time. Though they initially start out as rivals, their relationship ends up getting better, and they become partners in crime, setting them up for the pawpsicle hustle they did 17 years later in 2016, during the events of the movie.","completion":"In the urban jungle of Zootopia, where harmony and discord mingled like the endless sea of lights and shadows, the year was 1999. At this time, Nick Wilde, a teenage fox with a penchant for mischief, found himself in a situation that would alter the trajectory of his life. His latest scheme, a clever but ultimately illegal hustle involving counterfeit concert tickets, had caught the eye of Zootopia's finest, landing him in juvenile detention, or juvy, as the street-savvy residents called it. Nick's reputation as a smooth-talking fox preceded him, yet within the stark, unyielding walls of juvy, charm alone wasn't going to cut it. It was here, in the communal area shadowed by the weight of youthful mistakes, that Nick first caught sight of Finnick, a fennec fox with an attitude as outsized as his ears. Unlike Nick, Finnick was a loner, in for numerous, albeit small-scale, thefts. Their first meeting was anything but cordial; a rivalry ignited instantly, sparked by a heated argument over territory within the facility. Days turned into weeks, and the friction between Nick and Finnick continued, both vying for the upper hand in their little kingdom of lost boys. Their rivalry, however, began to take a different shape as they discovered a mutual disdain for a common enemy—a group of larger, more aggressive inmates who had taken to bullying the smaller residents of juvy, including Nick and Finnick. Reluctantly, Nick and Finnick formed a temporary alliance, pooling their cunning and wit to concoct a series of pranks and schemes that would put their bullies in their place. As their plans came to fruition, their reluctant partnership fostered a grudging respect between them. This respect deepened into a genuine friendship as they faced the challenges of juvy life together. It wasn't long before Nick and Finnick became inseparable, their skills complementing each other perfectly. Nick's silver tongue and Finnick's knack for thinking on his feet made them an unstoppable duo. They began to hatch more elaborate plans, not just for survival, but for their own amusement—and profit. From trading favors to orchestrating complex hustles within the confines of their juvenile detention center, they honed their craft, unknowingly laying the groundwork for their future endeavors. Their time in juvy wasn't just about survival; it was a baptism by fire, a place where their moral compasses were tested and their ambitions forged. They learned invaluable lessons about trust, loyalty, and the art of the hustle. By the time they were released, Nick and Finnick weren't just friends; they were partners in crime, in the most literal sense. Years passed, and their bond only grew stronger as they navigated the complexities of life in Zootopia. They looked out for each other, their friendship a beacon in the chaotic beauty of the city. It was this unbreakable bond that eventually led them to their most memorable scheme yet—the pawpsicle hustle—a cheeky nod to their days in juvy and a testament to their lasting friendship. So, when the citizens of Zootopia witnessed the ingenious yet questionable antics of Nick Wilde and Finnick during the events of 2016, little did they know that this dynamic duo's partnership was born out of a shared past, tempered by adversity and sealed in the crucible of Zootopia's juvenile detention center. From rivals to partners in crime, Nick and Finnick's journey was a reminder that even in a city as vast and varied as Zootopia, true friendship knows no boundaries."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Не могу рекомендовать такое странное заведение.","completion":"1. Приглянулся мне в салоне Аларм новенький Suzuki Swift, цвет морской волны, утверждали, в наличии и ждет меня. Ценник в прейскуранте демократичный, мечтал уже за руль сесть и город покорять. А когда приехал — картина маслом: ни машины, ни выбранного цвета, да и цена как на карусели, вверх взлетела. Агент сначала медом намазывал, а потом как заведенный: \\"А вы кредит? А вы доп. оборудование?\\" В итоге домой уехал на метро. Вот такие пирожки с котятами в этом Аларме. Рекомендовать? Ну его нафиг! 2. Вот решил я обновить своего железного коня, заглянул в салон Аларм, обещали скидки на Volkswagen Tiguan до невиданных высот! Думал, вот оно, счастье! Ан нет, приехал, а меня встречают как лимон для отжима. Тачки, что по акции, как мираж — видны, но не достать. А ценник по акции? Так, говорят, это если звезды совпадут и вы первый клиент в пятницу тринадцатого. Жуть как обидно, ведь уж был готов ключи забирать. В итоге потерял время и веру в честные сделки. 3. Покупка автомобиля Hyundai Creta в салоне Аларм обернулась полным разочарованием. Ехала я к ним с мыслью о честной сделке, а попала на базар в худшем виде. Первое, что оказалось — цены на сайте и в салоне как будто из разных вселенных. На сайте кричат о грандиозных скидках, а на деле ценник так и остается кусачим. Отношение персонала — отдельная песня, как будто я их от работы отвлекаю. Сплошной обман и навязывание ненужных услуг. Не повторите моих ошибок, обходите этот салон стороной. 4. О, сколько нервов и времени потратил, обращаясь в Аларм за Toyota Camry! Обещанная скидка оказалась заманухой для наивных. Машину, которую показывали на сайте, вообще в наличии не оказалось! Пытались мне всучить другую, подороже, разумеется. И где обещанная прозрачность сделки? А когда заговорил о возврате залога — настоящий цирк с конями начался. Как-то не ожидал я такой \\"любезности\\" от официального дилера. Не связывайтесь с Аларм, если цените свои деньги и время. 5. Была мечта — купить в Аларме Lada Vesta Sport, на сайте акция, шум, гам, я уже всю семью настроил на новую ласточку. Приехали, а нас как в холодный душ — машины по такой цене как не бывало. А цена с акцией, по их словам, только если взять кредит на невыгодных условиях и пакет услуг, которые мне даже в голову не приходили. Пробовал разговаривать, уточнять — нет, будто я виноват, что приехал. В общем, мечта купить машину разбилась о жадность и лукавство Аларма.

Метод капиллярного поднятия - этот метод основан на явлении капиллярного восходящего обтекания физических дефектов в материалах. Путем нанесения на поверхность материала специального красящего раствора и последующего его удаления по капиллярам, можно обнаружить микротрещины, поры и другие несовершенства. 2. Метод капиллярного проникновения - этот метод используется для обнаружения трещин и других поверхностных дефектов в материалах. Сначала на поверхность наносится специальный красящий раствор, который благодаря капиллярному действию проникает в трещины. После удаления излишков красящего вещества можно легко обнаружить и измерить размеры дефектов. 3. Капиллярный метод контрастирования - этот метод позволяет обнаруживать скрытые трещины и дефекты в материалах, которые не видны невооруженным глазом. Путем нанесения специального контрастирующего агента на поверхность материала и последующего его удаления, можно выделить дефекты и получить их изображение для дальнейшего анализа. 4. Капиллярный метод теплового контроля - этот метод основан на использовании изменений теплопроводности в материалах для обнаружения дефектов. Путем нагревания или охлаждения поверхности материала и наблюдения за изменениями в распределении тепла можно выявить скрытые трещины, поры и другие дефекты. 5. Метод капиллярного поглощения - этот метод используется для обнаружения утечек и пористости в материалах. Путем нанесения на поверхность материала специального абсорбента и наблюдения за его поглощением в капиллярах, можно определить места дефектов и оценить их размеры и глубину."},{"prompt":"Описание принципа работы капиллярных методов обнаружения дефектов","completion":"Капиллярные методы обнаружения дефектов представляют собой один из наиболее распространенных и эффективных способов неразрушающего контроля качества поверхности материалов и изделий. Этот метод позволяет выявить очень мелкие дефекты, такие как трещины, поры, непровары, сквозные отверстия и другие поверхностные дефекты. Принцип его действия основан на способности жидкости проникать в узкие капилляры и трещины под действием капиллярных сил. # Принцип работы 1. **Подготовка поверхности.** Перед началом процесса поверхность детали тщательно очищается от грязи, масла, ржавчины и других загрязнений, чтобы ничто не мешало проникновению капиллярной жидкости в потенциальные дефекты. 2. **Нанесение проникающей жидкости.** На подготовленную поверхность наносится специальная жидкость (проникатель), которая имеет низкое поверхностное натяжение и способна проникать в очень узкие трещины и капилляры. В зависимости от метода, проникатель может наноситься путём погружения, распыления или с помощью кисти. 3. **Время проникновения.** После нанесения проникателя, дается время, необходимое для его проникновения во все возможные участки с дефектами. Время зависит от конкретного типа жидкости и материала, который проверяется. 4. **Удаление излишков проникающей жидкости.** Поверхность тщательно очищается от излишков проникающей жидкости, чтобы она не мешала дальнейшему обнаружению дефектов. Очищение может проводиться с помощью специальных растворителей или воды, в зависимости от типа проникающей жидкости. 5. **Нанесение разработчика.** На обработанную и очищенную поверхность наносится разработчик. Разработчик может быть порошковым, водно-дисперсионным или на спиртовой основе. Он выступает в качестве визуализатора, впитывая оставшуюся в дефектах проникающую жидкость и делая дефекты видимыми для глаза или специальной аппаратуры. 6. **Оценка результатов.** После применения разработчика и соответствующего времени ожидания, производится визуальный осмотр поверхности. Проникшая в трещины и поры проникающая жидкость впитывается разработчиком и образует видимые следы, четко показывающие расположение и форму дефектов. Капиллярный метод обладает высокой чувствительностью и позволяет обнаружить дефекты на ранних стадиях, что значительно снижает риски использования деталей с скрытыми дефектами в критически важных областях промышленности и техники."},{"prompt":"основные капиллярные методы обнаружения дефектов описание","completion":"Капиллярные методы обнаружения дефектов, также известные как пенетрантные методы, делятся на несколько основных типов, в зависимости от используемых материалов и условий их применения. Вот основные из них: # Водно-удаляемые пенетранты Эти пенетранты могут быть удалены с поверхности проверяемого изделия с использованием воды. Они содержат поверхностно-активные вещества, которые обеспечивают их смачиваемость и проникновение в поверхностные дефекты. Водно-удаляемые пенетранты удобны для использования, так как для их удаления не требуются специальные растворители, однако они менее чувствительны по сравнению с другими типами пенетрантов. # Пост-эмульсионные, удаляемые водой пенетранты Пост-эмульсионные пенетранты требуют после нанесения и выдержки применения специального эмульгатора, который наносится на поверхность после процедуры с проникающей жидкостью. Эмульгатор вступает в реакцию с пенетрантом, делая его удаляемым водой. Данные пенетранты обеспечивают высокую чувствительность и используются для обнаружения очень мелких дефектов. # Растворители-удаляемые пенетранты Эти пенетранты удаляются с использованием специальных растворителей. Они обладают хорошей чувствительностью и могут использоваться на различных поверхностях. Растворители-удаляемые пенетранты чаще всего применяются в условиях, когда использование воды нежелательно или когда требуется высокая селективность обнаружения дефектов. # Капиллярные методы с сухими или влажными разработчиками После нанесения и удаления излишков пенетранта на поверхность наносится разработчик, который может быть как сухим, так и влажным. Сухие разработчики представляют собой порошкообразные вещества, которые эффективно впитывают пенетрант из дефектов, делая их видимыми. Влажные разработчики содержат суспензии тонкого порошка в жидком носителе; они наносятся распылением или погружением и после высыхания также впитывают пенетрант, обеспечивая визуализацию дефектов. # Флуоресцентные пенетранты Флуоресцентные пенетранты содержат специальные вещества, которые светятся под действием ультрафиолетового излучения. Этот тип капиллярного метода позволяет обнаружить даже чрезвычайно мелкие дефекты благодаря контрастному свечению в области дефекта при осмотре в темной комнате под ультрафиолетовым освещением. Флуоресцентные методы считаются высокочувствительными и применяются для контроля критически важных деталей. Каждый из этих методов имеет свои преимущества и сферы применения, выбор метода зависит от требований к чувствительности обнаружения дефектов, типа материала изделия и условий проведения контроля."},{"prompt":"write me a code to convert coordinates from yolo to coco","completion":"To convert object detection box coordinates from the YOLO format to COCO format, you need to understand the difference between these two formats: - YOLO (You Only Look Once) format specifies a bounding box using the x and y coordinates of the center of the box, along with the box's width and height. All four values are normalized to [0,1] by the image width and height. So the format is: \`[x_center, y_center, width, height]\`. - COCO (Common Objects in Context) format specifies a bounding box with the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the box followed by the box's width and height in pixels. The format is: \`[x_top_left, y_top_left, width, height]\`.

Особенно \\"порадовало\\", когда менеджер, видя мое возмущение, начал говорить: \\"Да у вас просто нереалистичные ожидания\\". Нет слов, одно разочарование. 3. В салоне Аларм обещали чудеса по трейд-ину на мой старенький Ford Focus. Сказано было, что выгода будет ощутима при покупке нового KIA Sorento. Но когда дело дошло до сделки, выяснилось, что \\"выгодные условия\\" - это как найти черную кошку в темной комнате. Мою машину оценили в полцены, а ценник на KIA каким-то чудом \\"подрос\\" за ночь. Пытался добиться справедливости, на что менеджер только усмехнулся и сказал, что я могу искать лучше, но не найду. Это полный позор! Как можно так обращаться с клиентами? 4. Отвратительный опыт покупки в салоне Аларм! Хотел приобрести Toyota RAV4, видел на их сайте прекрасные условия для покупки в лизинг. Но когда пришел обсуждать детали, оказалось, что вся информация на сайте - чистейшая выдумка. Лизинговые ставки в два раза выше, а обещанный \\"бонус\\" в виде комплекта зимней резины превратился в бесплатную омывайку. А когда я начал возражать и говорить о том, что это обман, менеджер фактически выставил меня дверь. Это просто беспредел! 5. Я в полном шоке от салона Аларм! Мечтал о Mercedes-Benz GLC, который на сайте обещали по акции с большой скидкой. Да, догадываюсь, что на деле все может быть не так радужно, но тут чистой воды обман! Сидим, обсуждаем, и тут менеджер мне сообщает, что акция закончилась (хотя на сайте дата еще не наступила), а машина под заказ ждать два месяца, и плюс ко всему цена внезапно на 30% выше. Это что, шутка такая? Прямое вранье клиентам в лицо. Никому не советую иметь дело с Алармом, разве что, хотите испортить себе настроение."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

A continuación, te ofrezco una guía general que es aplicable a la mayoría de las lentes de gafas: 1. **Lavado de manos**: Antes de manipular tus gafas, asegúrate de que tus manos estén limpias y libres de suciedad, grasa, lociones, o cualquier otra sustancia que pueda transferirse a las lentes. 2. **Enjuaga con agua**: Bajo un chorro de agua tibia, enjuaga suavemente las lentes para eliminar partículas de polvo y otras pequeñas partículas que puedan rayar las lentes durante la limpieza. 3. **Aplica un detergente suave**: Utiliza un limpiador de lentes específico o un pequeño toque de jabón de manos o detergente suave y sin fragancias. Aplica una gota en cada lente y con los dedos suavemente limpia las superficies. Evita usar productos con componentes agresivos que puedan dañar las lentes. 4. **Enjuaga las lentes**: Asegúrate de eliminar todo residuo de jabón enjuagándolas cuidadosamente con agua. 5. **Secado**: Usa un paño limpio de microfibra diseñado especialmente para lentes. Evita usar toallas de papel, pañuelos, ropa u otros materiales que puedan rayar las lentes. Seca las lentes suavemente sin ejercer demasiada presión. 6. **Inspección y retoque**: Luego de secar, si notas alguna mancha o rastro, utiliza el paño de microfibra para dar retoques suaves hasta que queden perfectamente limpias. Para preservar la calidad de tus lentes a largo plazo: - No expongas tus gafas a temperaturas extremas, ya que esto podría dañar el revestimiento de las lentes. - Guarda tus gafas en un estuche cuando no las utilices para evitar arañazos o daños. - Evita dejar tus gafas con las lentes hacia abajo en superficies ya que esto puede causar arañazos. - Considera el uso de un rociador de lentes antiestático para ayudar a mantener tus gafas libres de polvo y partículas.

Creo que por limpiarlas una vez así haya pasado algo malo a mi lentes","completion":"Utilizar toallitas perfumadas que están etiquetadas como aptas para todas las lentes, como las de Ubesol, generalmente no debería causar un daño inmediato a tus lentes si solo las usaste una vez. Sin embargo, el uso frecuente de productos que contienen perfumes o químicos fuertes puede, a largo plazo, afectar el recubrimiento de las lentes o la integridad del material, especialmente si tus lentes tienen tratamientos específicos como antirreflejantes, antirayas, entre otros. Si después de limpiarlas notaste algo diferente o te preocupa su estado, aquí están algunas cosas que puedes verificar: - **Verificación visual**: Mira a través de las lentes hacia una fuente de luz constante para identificar si hay manchas, rayones o áreas descoloridas que no estaban presentes antes. - **Sensaciones al usarlas**: Si percibes cambios en la claridad, el contraste, o si se presentan dificultades para enfocar que no tenías anteriormente, es importante prestar atención a estos cambios. - **Comprobar las superficies de las lentes**: Verifica ambas caras de las lentes para asegurarte de que el líquido de la toallita no haya dejado residuos o haya dañado el revestimiento. Si después de realizar estas verificaciones encuentras que tus gafas han sufrido algún deterioro, puede ser útil visitar donde las adquiriste o un profesional de la visión para una evaluación más precisa. Podrán decirte si los daños son superficiales o si hay algo más que necesite atención. Para futuras limpiezas, considera seguir las recomendaciones más tradicionales como usar sprays de limpieza específicos para gafas y toallitas de microfibra. Estos productos están diseñados para ser seguros para casi todos los tipos de lentes y revestimientos, minimizando el riesgo de daños. Si tus lentes están siendo usadas de manera correcta y las toallitas específicamente indican que son seguras para todo tipo de lentes, probablemente el uso ocasional no debería causar problemas. No obstante, siempre es mejor optar por el lado de la precaución con cuidado y mantenimiento regulares siguiendo las mejores prácticas."},{"prompt":"¿Como eliminar todo lo malo de las lentes procedentes de usar las toallitas perfumadas de ubesol en casa y sin ir a la óptica?","completion":"Si crees que el uso de toallitas perfumadas de Ubesol ha dejado residuos o ha causado algún tipo de efecto adverso en tus lentes, existen algunos pasos que puedes seguir en casa para intentar remediar la situación. Es importante proceder con cautela para evitar dañar aún más las lentes. Aquí te dejo un procedimiento básico que puedes intentar: 1. **Lavado suave con agua y jabón**: Comienza enjuagando tus lentes bajo un chorro de agua tibia. Esto ayuda a eliminar cualquier partícula de polvo o suciedad que pueda rayar las lentes durante la limpieza. Luego, aplica unas gotas de un jabón suave, idealmente uno sin fragancias, colorantes o agentes agresivos, en las lentes y usa los dedos limpios para frotar suavemente ambas superficies de las lentes en movimientos circulares. Ten cuidado de no aplicar demasiada presión. 2. **Enjuague completo**: Asegúrate de enjuagar completamente las lentes con agua tibia para quitar todos los restos de jabón. El residuo de jabón puede dejar manchas o crear una película sobre las lentes. 3. **Secado con un paño de microfibra**: Utiliza un paño limpio de microfibra específicamente diseñado para lentes ópticas. Estos paños no solo son suaves y no dejan residuos, sino que también son efectivos para eliminar manchas y huellas sin rayar las lentes. Seca las lentes dando toques suaves o dejándolas airear un momento antes de usar el paño. 4. **Inspección final**: Examina tus lentes para asegurarte de que hayas eliminado cualquier residuo o marca. Si aún ves marcas o si las lentes parecen empañadas, es posible que el proceso de limpieza deba repetirse. 5. **Consideración adicional**: Si tras intentar limpiarlas de esta manera en casa notas que aún persisten los problemas o las lentes parecen dañadas (por ejemplo, si el revestimiento parece estar afectado), podría ser necesario buscar el consejo de un profesional óptico. Aunque muchas situaciones se pueden solucionar en casa, ciertos daños en el revestimiento pueden requerir atención profesional. Recuerda que la prevención es clave para el cuidado de tus lentes. A futuro, evita usar toallitas o productos que no estén específicamente recomendados para el cuidado de lentes ópticas, especialmente si tienen revestimientos especiales. Utilizar sprays limpiadores para gafas y un paño de microfibra es generalmente la opción más segura y efectiva para el mantenimiento cotidiano."},{"prompt":"Quiero dejar las lentes como nuevas en casa. Que no tengan ningún daño. ¿Que hacer exactamente?","completion":"Para restaurar la claridad de tus lentes y tratar de dejarlas como nuevas sin causar daños adicionales, es esencial seguir un procedimiento de limpieza adecuado y delicado. Por favor, ten en cuenta que si las lentes ya han sufrido daños en el revestimiento o arañazos profundos, estos no podrán ser eliminados completamente con la limpieza y puede ser que necesites considerar reemplazar las lentes para tener una visión óptima. Sin embargo, aquí te dejo pasos para maximizar la limpieza y el cuidado de tus gafas en casa: # Limpieza Profunda de Lentes en Casa 1. **Preparación**: - Lávate bien las manos con jabón para eliminar grasa, suciedad y cualquier residuo que pueda transferirse a tus lentes. - Asegúrate de limpiar bajo un área bien iluminada para detectar cualquier mancha o suciedad en las lentes. 2. **Lavado**: - Enjuaga las lentes bajo agua tibia para eliminar partículas de polvo y arena que puedan rayar las lentes durante el lavado. - Aplica una gota pequeña de jabón líquido suave, libre de exfoliantes, aromas fuertes o aditivos agresivos, sobre cada lente. 3. **Limpieza**: - Con los dedos limpios, frota suavemente cada lado de las lentes así como el marco, incluyendo las plaquetas, patillas y cualquier ranura donde pueda acumularse suciedad. - Sé meticuloso pero suave al llegar a las esquinas y bordes. 4. **Enjuague**: - Enjuaga las lentes con agua tibia asegurándote de quitar todo el jabón. No dejes residuos de jabón, ya que estos pueden causar manchas cuando se sequen. 5. **Secado**: - Agita suavemente las gafas para quitar el exceso de agua. - Usa un paño de microfibra limpio y seco para tocar suavemente las lentes y remover el agua restante. No frotes las lentes con fuerza. - Si es necesario, puedes usar un pañuelo de papel suave sin aroma para retirar cualquier humedad de las esquinas donde el paño no llegue. 6. **Revisión de Detalles**: - Examina las lentes bajo una luz clara para asegurarte de que estén completamente limpias. - Si detectas áreas que necesitan atención adicional, repite cuidadosamente el proceso en esa zona específica. # Notas Adicionales - **Precaución con el Calor**: Evita exponer tus gafas a fuentes de calor directas (como secadores de cabello o el tablero del auto bajo el sol) para secarlas, ya que el calor puede dañar tanto las lentes como el armazón. - **Almacenamiento Adecuado**: Cuando no estés utilizando tus gafas, guárdalas en un estuche rígido para protegerlas de golpes y arañazos. - **Evita Materiales Abrasivos**: Nunca uses toallas de papel, ropa o cualquier otro material que no sea un paño de microfibra diseñado para limpiar lentes. Estos pueden contener fibras que rayan las lentes. Recuerda que seguir estas recomendaciones te ayudará a mantener tus lentes en las mejores condiciones posibles, pero no pueden revertir los daños preexistentes. Si tus lentes están muy dañadas, considera visitar a un profesional de la visión para discutir la posibilidad de reemplazarlas."},{"prompt":"No me has entendido quiero dejar las lentes como nuevas, sin arañazos, ni ningun daño en casa. ¿Que debo de hacer exactamente?","completion":"Entiendo mejor tu solicitud ahora. Si estás buscando eliminar arañazos o reparar cualquier tipo de daño físico en las lentes de tus gafas en casa, tengo que aclararte que, lamentablemente, una vez que las lentes están arañadas o dañadas, no hay una solución casera efectiva y segura para repararlas completamente y dejarlas como nuevas. Los métodos que prometen eliminar arañazos de las lentes a menudo pueden ser riesgosos y terminar dañando más las lentes, especialmente si tienen recubrimientos especiales. Sin embargo, aquí te menciono algunos puntos a considerar respecto a la situación: # Sobre Eliminar Arañazos - **Productos \\"Elimina Arañazos\\"**: Existen productos en el mercado que afirman poder eliminar arañazos, pero su eficacia puede ser muy limitada, especialmente en lentes con recubrimientos especiales como antirreflectantes o protección UV. Usar estos productos puede, en el peor de los casos, dañar aún más el recubrimiento de las lentes. - **Métodos Caseros**: Métodos caseros, como el uso de pasta de dientes, bicarbonato de sodio, o ceras, son populares en línea pero también pueden ser perjudiciales para las lentes, especialmente si estas tienen tratamientos especiales. Estos métodos pueden alterar la claridad de las lentes y dañar sus recubrimientos. # Recomendaciones - **Consulta Profesional**: La mejor opción es consultar con un optometrista o un técnico óptico profesional. Ellos pueden evaluar el daño de las lentes y aconsejarte correctamente. En muchos casos, la única solución para lentes arañadas es reemplazarlas. - **Prevención**: Para el futuro, considera invertir en lentes con recubrimientos antiarañazos y protección UV. Aunque no son infalibles, estos recubrimientos pueden ayudar a prolongar la vida útil de tus lentes. - **Protección y Cuidado Adecuado**: Siempre guarda tus gafas en un estuche duro cuando no las estés usando y limpia las lentes con un paño de microfibra y soluciones de limpieza específicas para gafas. # En Resumen Entiendo que quieras solucionar los arañazos y daños en casa, pero honestamente, para evitar correr el riesgo de dañar aún más tus lentes, lo más adecuado es consultar a un profesional. En algunos casos, el costo de intentar reparar lentes de manera casera puede ser más alto que simplemente reemplazarlas, especialmente si el daño empeora o compromete la visión de manera significativa."},{"prompt":"Напишите стихотворение про Никиту","completion":"В том городе, где рождается заря, Где каждый день как новая глава, Живет подросток, имя ему - Никита, Судьба его не проста, но красива.

It serves as a data provider by interacting with what appears to be a RESTful API, as indicated by the use of HTTP methods and endpoints (URLs). Each method in the class is an asynchronous function, utilizing \`async/await\` syntax for handling asynchronous operations more cleanly. Here's a breakdown of each method and its purpose: 1. **fetchCharacters()**: Fetches a list of characters from the \`{ENDPOINT}/personnages\` endpoint. It returns the parsed JSON response, containing an array of characters, if successful. 2. **fetchCharacter(id)**: Fetches a single character by its ID from the \`{ENDPOINT}/personnages/{id}\` endpoint. Similar to \`fetchCharacters()\`, it returns the parsed JSON of that specific character if found. 3. **fetchSkins()**: Retrieves all available skins from the \`{ENDPOINT}/skins\` endpoint. This method is used for fetching cosmetic options (skins) for characters, returning a JSON response of all available skins. 4. **fetchEquipments()**: Obtains all equipment items available from the \`{ENDPOINT}/equipements\` endpoint. This method is likely used to fetch gear or items that characters can use or equip, returning a JSON array of these items. 5. **findSkinByIdAndLevel(id, level)**: Finds a specific skin based on a character's ID and their level. It makes a request to \`{ENDPOINT}/skins\` with query parameters for \`id_personnage\` (character ID) and \`niveau\` (level), aiming to find a skin matching these criteria. It then returns the first item in the JSON response, which should be the matching skin. 6. **findEquipmentsByCharacterIdAndLevel(id, level)**: Searches for equipment based on a character's ID and their level, similar to how skins are fetched. It fetches all equipments first and then filters them on the client side to retrieve only those that match the specified character ID and whose level requirement is equal to or lower than the specified level. The class is designed to abstract away some of the complexities of working with the API directly, providing a more straightforward interface for getting data related to characters, their skins, and equipment. Each method has error handling using \`try-catch\` blocks, which log errors to the console if any occur during the fetch operation. This approach maintains resilience and provides debugging information without causing the application to crash due to unhandled errors. A potential improvement would be to more explicitly handle successful and unsuccessful HTTP responses.

[나보고 지금 코 찔찔이들이랑 같이 유치원 다니라는 거야? 그보다는 난 일을 해서 돈을 벌고 싶다고요. 아빠!] 아빠는 내 손을 큰 손으로 꽉 쥐었다. 양 비서는 여전히 속내를 알 수 없는 얼굴로 고개를 끄덕였다. “성국 군 부모님 의견은 잘 알겠습니다. 회사와 조율해보고 다시 연락드려도 될까요?” 양 비서는 아버지의 대리이기 때문에 즉석에서 어떤 일에 대한 의견을 제시하거나 결정할 권한은 없었다. “네, 저한테 연락 주시면 됩니다.” 김미영은 깍듯하게 대답했다. * * * 양 비서는 나가자마자 전재형 부회장에게 전화를 걸었다. 전재형 부회장의 목소리가 수화기 너머로 들려왔다. - 계약은? “성군 군 집에서는 계약금을 줄이더라도 2년 계약하고 싶다고 합니다. 성국 군이 다섯 살이 되면 평범하게 살도록 해주고 싶다고요. 어떻게 할까요?” - 흠. 전재형 부회장이 잠시 생각하는 소리가 들렸다. 양 비서는 차분하게 전재형 부회장의 말을 기다렸다. - 성국이네 집에서 원하는 대로 해줘. 계약금은 그쪽에서 이야기한 대로 하고. 대신, 선물을 하나 주고 싶은데. “부회장님, 계약 기간도 주는데, 선물을요?” 양 비서가 놀라 되물었다. - 삼전 그룹 장학생으로 키워보면 어떨까 해서. 이 아이를 통해서 연예계에도 삼전 그룹 장학생을 심을 수 있는지 시험해보고 싶어서 그러네. “알겠습니다. 부회장님.” 양 비서는 더는 토를 달지 않았다. 전재형 부회장은 한 번 마음을 먹으면 끝까지 밀고 나갔다. 전재형 부회장의 거래에 협의와 합의는 없었다. 제시만 있을 뿐이었다. * * * 일주일 후, 양 비서가 직접 집을 찾아왔다. 아빠가 쉬는 날이라 마침 집에 있던 차였다. 양 비서 옆에 있던 젊은 남자가 아빠에게 선물 상자를 내밀었다. “약소하지만, 한우입니다. 이번에 저희와 계약해주신 데 대한 작은 감사의 표시라고 생각해 주시면 될 것 같습니다.” “뭘 이런 것까지. 감사합니다.” 아빠는 약간 얼떨떨한 얼굴로 한우 선물세트를 받았다. 난생처음 받아보는 값비싼 선물이었다. 곧 양 비서는 작은 원룸 방을 보더니 빙긋이 미소를 지었다. “누추하지만 들어오셔서 커피라도 한 잔 하시죠.” 엄마가 얼른 방에 널브러진 잡동사니를 치우며 말했다. “그러면 저야 감사하죠.” 양 비서는 여전히 미소를 지으며 안으로 들어왔다. 아무리 재벌이라고 해도 서민의 삶을 무시하지 말라고 할아버지는 이야기하셨다. 물론 자수성가하신 할아버지 말고는 우린 누구도 서민의 삶에 대해 깊이 알지 못했다 나도 이 가난한 집에 태어나기 전까지는 원룸이란 것은 TV로만 봤다. [그 TV 속 원룸에 내가 살다니….] 나는 아장아장 걸어가서 양 비서의 바지를 잡았다. 그리고 인사를 꾸벅했다. “안냥-.” “성국이 지금 인사하는 거야?” “네에!” 이건 자신 있는 발음이었다. “성국이는 정말 똘똘한 것 같아요. 부모님께서 행복하시겠어요.” “저희 같은 부모 사이에서 어떻게 이런 복덩이가 나왔는지…. 저희도 매일 믿기지가 않습니다.” 엄마는 그사이 끓인 믹스 커피를 양 비서에게 내밀었다. 커피가 담긴 머그잔에는 ‘보쌈의 명가 행복 보쌈’이란 마크가 선명했다. 양 비서는 커피를 한 모금 마시더니 엄마를 쳐다봤다. “커피가 무척 맛있네요.” “제가 고등학교 졸업하고 경리 생활 했거든요. 커피는 많이 탔습니다.” [하아, 엄마. 그건 TMI야.] 어차피 엄마가 말하기 전에 양 비서는 이 모든 것을 알 터였다. 삼전 그룹의 이미지가 되는 모델의 뒷조사는 필수였다. 양 비서는 머그잔을 방바닥에 내려놨다. 그리고 엄마와 아빠를 번갈아봤다. 나는 저 눈빛을 한 번에 알아챘다. 회귀 전 아버지인 전재형의 지시를 말할 때의 눈빛이었다. “제가 오늘 찾아온 것은 계약에 대한 감사의 의미도 있지만, 선물을 하나 드리려고요.” “한우 주셨잖아요.” [아빠, 한우가 뭔 선물이야. 그냥 그건 인사야, 인사. 악수랑 같은 의미야.] 나는 양 비서를 초롱초롱한 눈으로 쳐다봤다. 삼전 그룹의 선물은 분명 사이즈부터 다르다. 양 비서가 천천히 입을 열었다. “기간이 줄긴 했지만, 저희는 그대로 전속 모델료를 1억 5천으로 제시했는데 1억만 받겠다고 고사하셨지 않습니까.” “일한 만큼 받아야 하는 거죠.” 아빠는 단호하게 고개를 끄덕였다. 양 비서는 흐뭇한 미소를 지었다. “그래서요. 부회장님께서 특별히 감사의 표시로 선물 두 가지를 준비하셨거든요.” “네에?” 아빠는 놀라서 입만 벌린 채 멍하니 양 비서를 바라봤다. 양 비서는 침착하게 가방에서 브로셔 두 개를 꺼냈다. 하나는 아파트 모델하우스에 가면 나눠주는 브로셔였고, 나머지 하나는 주식 관련 브로셔였다. [이거지!] 나는 얼른 두 손으로 주식 관련 브로셔로 기어갔다. 그 순간, 아빠가 나를 안아 들었다. “성국아, 잠시만.” [어떻게 잠시만이라고 말할 수 있어. 나 지금 매우 흥분 상태야. 삼전 전자 주식이 10년 후에, 아니 20년 후에 얼마가 되는 줄 알아, 아빠?] 아빠는 얼른 내 엉덩이를 도닥였다. “성국아, 쉿!” 양 비서가 나를 보더니 배시시 웃었다. “그럼, 말씀드릴게요. 이 브로셔는 저희 삼전 건설에서 잠실에 건설 중인 아파트 브로셔입니다. 부회장님께서는 거기 한 채를 특별 분양 해주시라고 합니다. 4페이지 보시면 있는 34평형입니다.” 아빠와 엄마는 아파트라는 말에 두 눈만 끔뻑였다. 삼전 그룹의 계열사 중 하나인 삼전 건설. 특별 분양이라는 말은 삼전 그룹의 임직원 등에게 해주는 일종의 특혜였고, 삼전 건설이 지은 아파트 한 채를 그냥 준다는 말이었다. 엄마, 아빠는 이 말뜻을 이해하지 못해서 눈만 끔뻑거렸다. 아빠는 잠시 생각을 한 후에 조심스레 입을 열었다. “양 비서님, 죄송하지만요. 보시다시피 저희는 잠실에 이사 갈 형편이 안 됩니다. 잠실 아파트면 못 해도 1억은 훨씬 넘을 텐데요. 분양받는다고 해도 계약금도 못 치를 형편입니다. 성국이 모델료는 성국이 몫으로 저축할 거거든요. 그걸 건드리는 일은 안 하기로 아내랑 이야기했어요.” 양 비서가 포근한 미소를 지었다. 아빠가 양 비서의 말을 제대로 이해하지 못했다는 것은 단번에 눈치 챘다. “성국이 아버님, 제 말은요. 성국이가 2년 동안 저희 전속 모델을 하는 조건으로 무료로 분양해 드린다는 겁니다. 물론 자잘한 세금은 성국이 아버님이 내셔야겠지만요.” “네에?!” 아빠는 또다시 입을 벌린 채 아무 말도 못 했다. 엄마 역시 마찬가지였다. 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. [삼전 같은 대기업한테 아파트 하나야 수많은 모래알 중 하나라고. 손가락 사이로 한 알 흐른다고 누가 알아?] 나는 아빠 옷깃을 잡아당겼다. [엄마, 아빠, 없는 티 좀 내지 말고 어서 받아. 이게 다 내 덕이야.] 어느새 기어 다니기 시작하는 민국이가 옆으로 다가와 콩 주먹으로 나를 툭 건드렸다. [이 녀석이 어른 앞에서 이미지 관리해야 하는데, 신경을 건드리네. 저리 가.] 나는 발로 슬쩍 민국이를 밀었다. 그게 뭐가 좋은지 민국이는 이도 안 난 입을 헤벌쭉 벌리고 웃었다. “헤헤헤.” [좋단다.] 민국이 이 녀석은 나만 보면 히죽히죽 웃어댔다. [남자가 그렇게 웃음이 헤프면 안 되는 거야.] 나와 민국이를 보고 있던 양 비서가 흐뭇한 미소를 지었다. “벌써부터 성국 군이 동생을 잘 챙기네요.” 양 비서는 자세를 바로잡고 엄마가 탄 커피를 마저 마시곤 아빠를 쳐다봤다. 이제 대망의 주식이었다. [자, 양 비서. 어서 말해!] 나는 양 비서를 재촉했다. 양 비서는 나머지 브로셔 하나를 아빠와 엄마에게 밀었다. “원래 저희가 1억 5천 제시했는데 1억으로 내려 주셨잖아요. 그 깎은 계약금 5천만 원은 주식으로 드리려고요. 이게 두 번째 선물입니다.” [대에박!] 나는 벌떡 자리에서 일어나서 어깨춤을 추기 시작했다. [양 비서 만세! 아니지, 삼전 전자 만세! 장투다!] 엄마가 아빠 눈치를 보더니 조용히 입을 열었다. “주식은 성국이 이름 앞으로 해주시는 거죠?” “법무팀에서 아무 문제 없이 처리할 테니, 그 부분은 걱정 마세요.” 아빠가 엄마를 빤히 쳐다봤다. “소영아, 주식 좀 알아?” “잘은 모르는데, 성국이가 뉴스만 보잖아. 같이 보다 보니까 요즘 삼전 주식은 무조건 사야 한다고 하더라고.” [역시 엄마를 내가 뉴스로 교육시킨 보람이 있네.] 나는 얼른 엄마의 등을 두 번 토닥였다. 아빠만 얼빠진 상태였다. 양 비서는 흐뭇하게 우리 가족을 쳐다봤다. “성국이 아버님, 저희와 제품이 겹치지만 않으면 광고를 해도 되지만, 저희와 상의를 해주셔야 한다는 조항이 있잖아요.” 삼전 전자는 꼭 이런 조항을 넣었다. 연예인들이 무분별하게 광고를 찍다 보면 삼전 전자가 추구하는 이미지와 다르거나 겹치는 광고까지 찍어 광고의 효율성을 떨어뜨리기 때문이다. 아빠는 고개를 끄덕였다. “네, 그거야 당연한 거로 생각했습니다. 전속 모델이잖아요.” “제약이 생긴 것에 대한 보상이라고 생각해 주세요.” 양 비서는 인자한 미소를 지었다. “하지만… 이건 너무 큰 것 같습니다. 돈도 돈인데, 아파트랑 주식이라뇨. 아무리 제한이 생겼다지만 너무 당황스러워서요. 며칠 동안 저희끼리 상의해봐도 될까요?” “그럼요. 일주일 정도 드리면 될까요? 신상품 광고는 적어도 다음 달 초에는 찍어야 해서요.” “네, 빨리 상의해서 연락드리겠습니다.” 아빠는 떠나는 양 비서에게 꾸벅 인사를 했다. [아이고, 뒷골이야.] 나는 옆에 있는 젖병을 들고 벌컥벌컥 우유를 들이켰다. 엄마가 놀라서 달려왔다. “성국아, 배고파? 민국이 거 먹으면 어떡해.” [배고픈 게 아니라, 속이 탄다고. 엄마. 아빠 좀 설득해봐. 공짜로 준다는 걸 왜 마다해?] 아빠가 현관문을 닫고 들어왔다. “자기야, 근데 진짜 아파트 공짜로 준다는 거야?” “근데… 잠실이면 난 가본 적도 없고, 보쌈 집이랑도 너무 멀잖아. 아무래도 거절하는 게 맞는 것 같아.” 다시 민국이의 젖병에 손을 대려는 순간, 민국이 이 녀석이 잽싸게 젖병을 물었다. [역시 동생은 영원한 경쟁자이다.] “자기야, 미영이 언니한테 상의해보는 거 어때? 언니가 우리 성국이 매니저고, 부동산이랑 주식은 우리보다 잘 알잖아.” “당연히 그래야지. 그래서 바로 대답 안 한 거야. 솔직히 대기업이 얼마나 크고 무서운 데인데. 우리 같은 사람에게 허투루 그런 큰 것을 줄 리가 없잖아.” 나는 팔짱을 끼고 끄덕였다. [그건 맞는 말이야, 아빠.] 나도 그게 좀 이상했다. 아무리 기간을 줄이고 금액을 깎았다고 해도 계약금도 베이비 모델 중에서는 최고 수준인데, 특별 선물이라니. 세상에 공짜는 없는 법이다. 엄마가 고민에 빠진 나를 안아 들었다. “오늘은 쉬고, 내일 내가 언니 만나서 이야기해 볼게.” “성국아, 아빠한테 와. 너 이제 무거워져서 엄마 힘들어.” 아빠가 나를 번쩍 들어 올렸다. “성국이도 긴장했어?” [긴장한 게 아니라, 저 거래의 이면을 고민 중이었다고. 삼전 그룹이 호락호락한 회사가 절대 아니라고, 아빠.]","completion":"Episode 17 Kim Mi-young was the one who answered. \\"We've discussed it with Sung-guk's parents, and they would like to reduce the exclusive contract period from 3 years to 2 years.\\" \\"Father, are you not satisfied with the amount we've offered?\\" Secretary Yang asked cautiously. A contract could be overturned or established due to a single delicate clause. Dad answered carefully. \\"We think the amount is more than generous. It's just that, when Sung-guk turns five, he'll need to attend kindergarten. Both of them wish for him to grow up normally, without exposing his face on advertisements or broadcasts anymore.\\" [I was born special, but they're telling me to grow up ordinary.] I grumbled vehemently. Secretary Yang smiled at me. \\"It seems Sung-guk doesn't like that idea either?\\" \\"An exclusive contract for 3 years with 150 million, the amount you've offered is honestly too generous. Even if we reduce the amount to 100 million, we would like to proceed with a 2-year contract.\\" Dad was quite serious. \\"Being exclusive with us would be much better for Sung-guk than shooting various advertisements.\\" \\"Of course, we understand. It's not because we're greedy for other advertisements, but we truly wish to raise Sung-guk normally once he turns five. He'll be attending kindergarten, and we don't want him to miss out because of work.\\" Tap. Tap. Tap. I deliberately tapped the table irritably. [Are you telling me to attend kindergarten with those snotty kids? I'd rather work and earn money. Dad!] Dad firmly grasped my hand. Secretary Yang, still with an inscrutable face, nodded. \\"Would it be alright to discuss this with the company and get back to you?\\" Since Secretary Yang was acting on behalf of my father, she didn't have the authority to make or suggest decisions on the spot. \\"Yes, please contact me.\\" Kim Mi-young answered politely. * * * As soon as Secretary Yang left, she called Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's voice came through from the other end of the phone. - What about the contract? \\"The Sung-guk family would like to reduce the contract fee but agree to a 2-year contract. They wish to provide a normal life for Sung-guk once he turns five. What should we do?\\" - Hmm. Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung pondered for a moment. Secretary Yang waited calmly for his response. - Do as Sung-guk's family wishes. Proceed with the contract fee as they mentioned. However, I'd like to give them a gift. \\"A gift, sir, even though we're adjusting the contract period?\\" Secretary Yang asked in surprise. - How about raising him as a Samsung Group scholarship student? I want to see if we can plant a Samsung Group scholarship student in the entertainment industry through this child. \\"Understood, sir.\\" Secretary Yang didn't argue further. Once Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung made up his mind, he pushed through to the end. There was no negotiation or agreement in Vice Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's deals, only propositions. * * * A week later, Secretary Yang personally visited our house. It happened to be Dad's day off, so he was at home. A young man next to Secretary Yang handed Dad a gift box. \\"It's a small token, Korean beef. Please consider it a small token of our gratitude for signing the contract with us.\\" \\"What's all this? Thank you.\\" Dad received the Korean beef gift set with a slightly bewildered face. It was the first time we received such an expensive gift. Soon, Secretary Yang glanced at the small one-room apartment and smiled brightly. \\"It's humble, but please come in for a cup of coffee.\\" Mom hurriedly cleaned up the clutter in the room and said. \\"I'd be grateful for that.\\" Secretary Yang entered with a smile still on her face. No matter how wealthy, my grandfather always said not to disregard the lives of common people. Of course, aside from my self-made grandfather, none of us truly understood the life of commoners. Before I was born into this poor house, I had only seen one-room apartments on TV. [To think I'm living in one of those one-room apartments I saw on TV...] I toddled over and grabbed Secretary Yang's pants, then bowed politely. \\"Hello-.\\" \\"Is Sung-guk saying hello now?\\" \\"Yes!\\" I was confident in my pronunciation. \\"Sung-guk seems very smart. Your parents must be happy.\\" \\"How did such a blessing come from parents like us... We can't believe it every day.\\" While Mom was serving the mixed coffee she had brewed, the mug clearly had the logo of 'The House of Bossam Happiness'. Secretary Yang took a sip of the coffee and looked at Mom. \\"The coffee is quite delicious.\\" \\"I worked as an accountant after graduating high school. I've made a lot of coffee.\\" [Ah, Mom. That's TMI.] Even before Mom spoke, Secretary Yang must have known everything. Investigating the background of a model representing Samsung Group's image was essential. Secretary Yang put down the mug on the floor and looked back and forth between Mom and Dad. I recognized that look in his eyes immediately. It was the same look he had when he was about to convey instructions from my previous life's father, Jeon Jae-hyung. \\"Today's visit is not only to express our gratitude for the contract but also to give you a gift.\\" \\"We already received the beef.\\" [Dad, beef isn't a gift. It's just a greeting, like a handshake.] I looked up at Secretary Yang with sparkling eyes. Samsung Group's gifts were surely different in scale. Secretary Yang slowly began to speak. \\"Although the period has been reduced, we've offered the same exclusive model fee of 150 million, but you've declined and asked for only 100 million.\\" \\"We should receive as much as we work for.\\" Dad nodded firmly. Secretary Yang smiled warmly. \\"So, as a special token of our gratitude, the Vice Chairman has prepared two gifts for you.\\" \\"Really?\\" Dad looked at Secretary Yang, mouth agape in surprise. Secretary Yang calmly took out two brochures from his bag. One was a brochure you'd receive at an apartment model house, and the other was related to stocks. [This is it!] I quickly crawled towards the stock-related brochure. At that moment, Dad picked me up. \\"Sung-guk, just a moment.\\" [How can you say 'just a moment'? I'm very excited right now. Do you know how much Samsung Electronics stocks will be worth in 10 years, or even 20 years, Dad?] Dad quickly patted my back. \\"Sung-guk, shh!\\" Secretary Yang looked at me and chuckled. \\"Then, let me explain. This brochure is from Samsung Construction, currently building an apartment in Jamsil. The Vice Chairman has decided to offer you a special allocation of one of those apartments. If you look at page 4, it's the 34-square-meter type.\\" Mom and Dad were stunned at the mention of an apartment. Samsung Group's subsidiary, Samsung Construction. A special allocation meant a kind of privilege given to Samsung Group's employees and others, essentially giving away an apartment built by Samsung Construction. Mom and Dad blinked, unable to grasp the meaning. After a moment of thought, Dad cautiously spoke. \\"Secretary Yang, I'm sorry, but as you can see, we're not in a position to move to Jamsil. An apartment in Jamsil would cost at least over 100 million, and even if we were allocated one, we couldn't afford the contract fee. We've decided to save Sung-guk's modeling fee for him, and we won't touch it.\\" Secretary Yang smiled warmly. Dad hadn't fully understood what Secretary Yang meant, and it was immediately apparent. \\"Sung-guk's father, what I mean is, we're offering the apartment for free as a condition for Sung-guk being our exclusive model for 2 years. Of course, you'll have to pay some minor taxes.\\" \\"What?!\\" Dad was speechless again. So was Mom. I shrugged my shoulders. [To a giant corporation like Samsung, an apartment is just one of many grains of sand. What does it matter if one grain slips through the fingers?] I tugged at Dad's clothes. [Mom, Dad, stop showing off your lack of wealth and just accept it. This is all thanks to me.] Soon, Min-guk, who had started crawling, came over and poked me with his little fist. [This kid is messing with my image management in front of adults. Go away.] I gently pushed Min-guk away with my foot. For some reason, Min-guk opened his toothless mouth wide and laughed. \\"Hehehe.\\" [He likes it.] Min-guk always giggled whenever he saw me. [A man shouldn't laugh so openly.] Watching me and Min-guk, Secretary Yang smiled warmly. \\"Sung-guk is already taking good care of his younger brother.\\" Secretary Yang straightened up and finished the rest of the coffee Mom had made, then looked at Dad. Now, it was time for the stocks. [Come on, Secretary Yang. Say it!] I urged Secretary Yang. Secretary Yang pushed the remaining brochure towards Mom and Dad. \\"Originally, we offered 150 million, but you've reduced it to 100 million. The remaining 50 million contract fee will be given in stocks. This is the second gift.\\" [Jackpot!] I jumped up and started dancing a shoulder dance. [Long live Secretary Yang! No, long live Samsung Electronics! Long-term investment!] Mom glanced at Dad and quietly spoke. \\"The stocks will be under Sung-guk's name, right?\\" \\"The legal team will handle everything smoothly, so don't worry about that.\\" Dad stared at Mom. \\"So-young, do you know about stocks?\\" \\"I don't know much, but Sung-guk always watches the news. Watching it together, I heard that Samsung stocks are a must-buy these days.\\" [That's the result of my news education for Mom.] I quickly patted Mom's back twice. Dad was still in a daze. Secretary Yang looked at our family warmly. \\"Sung-guk's father, as long as the advertisements don't overlap with our products, it's fine to shoot them, but you must consult with us due to the clause, right?\\" Samsung Electronics always included such a clause. If celebrities indiscriminately shoot advertisements, it could conflict with Samsung Electronics' desired image or even overlap, reducing the effectiveness of the advertisements. Dad nodded. \\"Yes, we thought that was a given since he's an exclusive model.\\" \\"Please consider it compensation for the restrictions.\\" Secretary Yang smiled kindly. \\"But... this seems too much. Not just the money, but an apartment and stocks. Even considering the restrictions, it's overwhelming. Could we discuss it among ourselves for a few days?\\" \\"Of course. Would a week be enough? We need to shoot the new product advertisement by early next month at the latest.\\" \\"Yes, we'll discuss it quickly and contact you.\\" Dad bowed deeply as Secretary Yang left. [Oh, my back.] I grabbed a nearby baby bottle and gulped down the milk. Mom rushed over in surprise. \\"Sung-guk, are you hungry? What if Min-guk needs it.\\" [I'm not hungry; I'm anxious, Mom. Try to persuade Dad. Why refuse something given for free?] Dad closed the front door and came back in. \\"Honey, are they really giving us the apartment for free?\\" \\"But... Jamsil is too far, and it's far from our bossam shop. It seems right to decline.\\" Just as I was about to reach for Min-guk's bottle again, Min-guk quickly grabbed it and started drinking. [Indeed, a sibling is an eternal rival.] \\"Honey, how about consulting with Mi-young unnie? She's Sung-guk's manager, and she knows more about real estate and stocks than we do.\\" \\"Of course, that's why I didn't answer immediately. Honestly, how can a big corporation carelessly give away something so big to people like us?\\" I crossed my arms and nodded. [That's a valid point, Dad.] I also found it strange. Even if the period was reduced and the amount was cut, the contract fee was still the highest among baby models, and now a special gift? There's no such thing as a free lunch in this world. Mom picked me up, deep in thought. \\"Let's rest today, and I'll talk to unnie tomorrow.\\" \\"Sung-guk, come to Dad.
