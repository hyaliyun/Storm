[일론, 저 제품들이 모두 중고가 될 때쯤 스페이스 X는 성공할 텐데. 그냥 받아둬.] * * * 나는 드디어 가방을 챙기기 시작했다. 이제 마셜 제도도 떠날 때가 다가왔다. 짐이 원한 매트리스뿐 아니라 맥주와 각종 가전제품들도 모두 도착했다. 직원들은 한결 나은 환경에서 일하기 시작했다. 짐이 가방을 챙기는 내게 다가왔다. “성국, 이제 정말 떠나는 거예요?” “제 일은 다 했으니까, 떠나야죠.” “다시 미국으로 돌아가요?” “네….” 짐은 아쉬운 표정이었다. “비행기는 언제예요?” “모레 아침 9시요.” “내가 운전해서 데려다줄게요.” “고마워요, 짐….” 할 말을 다 하고도 짐은 내 방에서 계속 서성였다. “짐, 뭐 할 말 있어요?” “그게요. 성국, 내가 여기서 뭐 살 수 있는 게 없어서요. 이게 제 선물이에요.” 짐은 내게 설계도면 하나를 내밀었다. “짐, 이게 뭐예요?” “내가 처음으로 설계한 우주 왕복선이요. 물론 대외비 같은 거 아니에요. 대학 때, 수업 시간에 한 거예요.” “그럼, 짐에게 엄청 소중한 거잖아요.” “그 소중한 꿈을 포기하려고 했는데, 성국 때문에 지킬 수 있게 됐잖아요. 만약 성국을 못 만났다면… 나도 아마 비행기 표 끊어서 미국으로 가버렸을 거예요.” 나는 얼른 설계도면을 받았다. “짐, 선물은 잘 받을게요.” “성국… ‘페이스 노트’ 자주 업데이트해줘야 해요. 성국 ‘페이스 노트’ 보는 낙에 난 여기서 살잖아요.” “짐은 낚시한 거 자주 올려줘요. 난 정말 이 섬을 떠나면 이 섬에서 낚았던 물고기들이 너무 그리울 것 같아요.” “우리가 놓친 상어도요?” “놓친 게 아니라, 그 상어는 어장에 관리 중이잖아요.” “아, 맞다!” 짐은 빙그레 미소 지었다. 나는 짐이 그린 설계도면을 얼른 가방에 챙겨 넣었다. * * * 공항까지는 일론과 짐이 함께했다. 일론은 다 낡은 트럭을 몰면서 쉼 없이 떠들었다. “성국, 대한민국 가전 정말 끝내줘. 미국으로 돌아가면 우리 집 모든 가전도 다 한국 제품으로 바꿔야겠어.” “일론, 나한테 말만 해요. 내가 다 추천해줄게요.” [내가 모델로 한 삼전도 좋고. 나 후원한 효진 그룹 제품들도 다 좋아. 가전은 역시 한국이지.] 덜컹. 덜컹. 덜컹. 트럭은 계속해서 흔들렸다. “성국, 미국으로 다시 돌아가는 거면 ‘페이스 노트’로 가는 거야?” “우선은요.” “그럼 다시 ‘페이스 노트’에 집중하게?” “제가 할 수 있는 일은 할 거지만, 이제 새로운 기업에 투자하는 쪽으로 생각해 보려고요.” “새로운 기업?” “스페이스 Z처럼 미래를 여는 기업들이요.” 나는 빙긋 웃었다. ‘페이스 노트’는 나를 세계적인 부자로 만들어주고 있다. 그렇다면 이제 우리 가족을 부자로 만들어줄 회사에 투자를 해야 할 때가 왔다. 민국이는 앞으로 전 세계적인 아이돌 그룹의 일원이 될 것이기 때문에, 민국이의 재능을 보여줄 수 있는 너튜브와 ‘페이스 노트’ 같은 SNS가 절대적으로 필요하다. 앞으로는 SNS를 통해서 대한민국뿐만 아니라 세계적인 가수가 될 수 있기 때문이다. 그리고 지희의 의견은 아직 물어보진 않았지만, 앞으로 대한민국을 대표할 의사가 될 지희를 위해서도 의학 분야 쪽의 투자도 해볼 생각이다. 마침 피터가 아주 흥미로운 기업이 있다는 연락이 왔다. 짐은 옆에서 나를 마치 우상처럼 쳐다봤다. “성국이라면 정말 다 잘해낼 거예요.” “짐, 너무 치켜세우지 마요. 저도 실수 많이 해요.” “성국, 만약에 힘든 일 있으면 마셜 제도 와서 같이 낚시해요.” “휴가 때 올 테니까, 그때 꼭 같이 낚시해요.” 내 말에 일론이 클랙슨을 빵빵 울렸다. “성국, 우리는 1년 안에 마셜 제도 탈출할 거야!” “알았어요, 일론!” [제발 빨리 성공하라고! 그래야 투자자인 나도 돈 좀 벌지!] * * * 마크가 나를 격하게 껴안았다. “성국, 우리가 이렇게 오랫동안 안 본 건 처음 아니야?” [마크, 오버하지 마. 나 연습생 한다고 한국 가 있을 때도 한 달은 못 봤잖아.] “마크, 그동안 ‘페이스 노트’ 잘 지키고 있었지?” “당연하지. 나 제법 CEO 같지 않아?” 마크는 오늘도 체크 셔츠를 입고 있었다. “잘 어울리는데.” “참, 성국. 이젠 ‘페이스 노트’에 계속 머무를 거지?” “흠… 머물긴 할 것 같은데. 나 사무실 하나만 주면 안 돼?” “주면 안 되냐니? 너도 공동 CEO잖아.” “사실은 좀 하고 싶은 일이 있어서….” “무슨 일을 하고 싶은데?” “이제 본격적으로 다양한 기업에 투자를 해보고 싶어.” 마크의 얼굴이 시무룩해졌다. “성국, 넌 ‘페이스 노트’에만 집중할 수 없는 거야?” “마크, 내가 여러 루트로 투자를 해둬야 혹시 ‘페이스 노트’가 자금난에 휘청할 때, 내가 ‘페이스 노트’를 도울 수 있지.” [이게 바로 대한민국 재벌의 구조야, 마크.] 물론 대한민국의 재벌들은 문어발식으로 모든 산업을 먹어 치우면서 성장한다. 하지만 나는 가능성 있는 기업에 투자하면서 이익을 내서 내가 원하는 산업에 다시 재투자할 계획이다. 마크는 포기한 듯 피식 웃었다. “내가 널 어떻게 당하겠어. 그나저나 피터가 오늘 무슨 파티에 같이 가자던데. 우리 보고 슈트 입으라고 연락이 왔어.” “흠… 마크, 너 슈트 있어?” “너랑 고등학교 졸업식 때 입은 게 내 유일한 슈트 같아서 어제 꺼내 봤더니, 미미 씨가 촌스럽다고 절대 입지 말래. 제발 돈을 벌었으면, 돈도 좀 쓰라면서 아주 성질을 냈어.” “역시 한국 여자는 무섭지?” “무섭지만, 그게 또 매력이잖아.” 마크는 리미미에게 푹 빠져 있었다. “마크, 그럼 우리 오랜만에 옷 사러 가볼까?” “좋지!” 마크는 체크 셔츠 차림으로, 나는 늘 입는 후드 티 차림으로 백화점으로 향했다. * * * 나는 백화점 1층의 명품 매장으로 거침없이 들어갔다. 마크가 뒤에서 종알거리며 따라왔다. “성국, 우리가 이제 투자도 제대로 받고 CEO로 월급도 받지만, 여긴 너무 비싸잖아.” [내가 재벌일 때, 이런 데서 밖에 옷을 안 사봐서….] 나는 머리를 긁적였다. “마크, 내가 옷 살게. 난 월급도 월급이지만, 투자해서 수익 내는 것도 있잖아.” “성국, 너랑 오래 알았는데도 이럴 때 보면 정말 전혀 모르는 사람을 보는 것 같아.” “오랜만에 슈트 입는데, 멋진 걸로 입어줘야지.” 나는 톰 포라가 이끌고 있는 구씨 브랜드로 들어갔다. [톰 포라의 구씨는 역시 섹시한 맛이 있어.] 나는 흐뭇한 얼굴로 구씨의 남성복 컬렉션을 훑었다. 마크는 뒤에서 멋쩍은 얼굴로 나만 졸졸 따라왔다. “성국, 여긴 내 이미지랑 전혀 안 어울리는 것 같아.” “마크, 나만 믿고 한번 입어봐. 오늘 인기 폭발일 거야.” 이때, 점원으로 보이는 키가 큰 금발의 여직원이 다가오더니 딱딱한 얼굴로 우리를 위아래로 훑었다. “뭐, 찾으시는 거라도 있어요?” 목소리부터 못마땅한 게 느껴졌다. “이번 시즌 남성복 슈트 보여주세요.” “흠… 두 분 다요?” “네. 오늘 저녁 파티에 입고갈 옷이 필요하거든요.” 나는 지갑에서 카드 한 장을 꺼내서 직원에게 보였다. 바로 미국 내 상위 1%에게만 내준다는 블랙 카드였다. 직원은 카드를 보더니 좀 전의 거만한 태도는 숨기고, 얼른 자세를 낮췄다. “고객분들 마실 거라도 드릴까요? 샴페인 어떠세요?” “전 물이면 됐고요. 마크, 너는?” “전 샴페인 좋아요.” “네, 그럼 이쪽으로 안내할게요.” 직원은 우리를 VIP룸으로 안내하곤 곧 생수와 샴페인을 대접했다. “잠시만 기다리세요. 구씨 컬렉션 준비하겠습니다.” 직원이 사라지자, 마크가 내 옆구리를 찔렀다. “성국, 너 그 카드 어디서 났어?” “어… 스페이스 Z에 투자하려고 가전제품이랑 이것저것 좀 많이 샀거든. 그랬더니 카드 회사에서 내가 ‘페이스 노트’ 대표인 거 확인하고 내주던데?” “대박….” 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. 블랙카드의 발급 기준은 재산도 재산이지만, 그만큼 ‘페이스 노트’의 인지도가 미국 내에서도 인정받고 있다는 것을 의미했다. 곧 직원이 구씨의 남성복 라인을 가지고 왔다. 나는 익숙하게 내게 가장 잘 어울릴 것 같은 옷을 단번에 골랐다. [역시 재벌 안목은 어디 안 갔어.] * * * 파티가 열리는 샌프란시스코의 호텔에 들어서자, 모두의 시선이 나에게 쏟아졌다. 마크는 불편한 듯 연신 셔츠의 단추를 풀었다 잠갔다 반복했다. “성국, 다들 우리를 보는데.” “우리가 아니라 나를 보니까, 너무 쫄지 마. 마크.” “암튼 못 말려.” 이때, 우리를 초대한 피터가 환하게 웃으면서 걸어왔다. “성국! 마크! 이게 얼마 만이야. 둘 다 오늘 너무 멋진데?” “칭찬 감사해요.” 피터가 마크의 어깨를 탁 잡았다. “마크도 꽤 멋있어.” “피터, 전 그냥 여기서 맛있는 거나 먹고 갈게요.” “마크, 자네도 이제 ‘페이스 노트’의 CEO인데 이런 자리를 즐겨야지. 여기 실리콘밸리의 유력 인사들이 다 모인 파티니까 얼굴이나 익혀둬. 앞으로 서로 볼 일 많은 사람들이야.” 피터는 조용히 내 곁에 다가왔다. “성국, 오늘 소개해줄 사람이 있어.” “말씀하신 의학계의 찰리 잡스요?” “응. 스탠포드를 중퇴하고 혈액 한 방울로 각종 병을 검사할 수 있는 진단 키트를 만드는 벤처 회사야.” [잠깜…] 나는 멈춰 섰다. 그리고 인상을 구겼다. 마침, 익숙한 얼굴이 내 앞에 나타나서 손을 내밀었다. “어머, ‘페이스 노트’의 전성국 맞죠?” [하아- 원수는 외나무다리에서 만난다고 했던가. 애슐리 홈즈?] 애슐리 홈즈는 아무것도 모른 채 날 보고 웃었다. 나는 애슐리 홈즈의 손을 탁 잡았다. “안녕하세요. 전성국이라고 합니다.” “전 블러드테라피의 애슐리 홈즈예요!”","completion":"Episode 174 Beds and mattresses started arriving at the Space Z office in the Marshall Islands. At the same time, fans, refrigerators, and washing machines from South Korea began to come in one after another. The employees looked at me with wide eyes. Tom was the most surprised. \\"Sung-guk, what's all this?\\" \\"These are the items I promised to Jim.\\" Jim was puzzled when he saw the fans and refrigerators. \\"Sung-guk, I didn't talk about these. I only mentioned mattresses.\\" Jim was really honest and not greedy. \\"I thought there were many other things needed besides mattresses, so I ordered what seemed necessary during my stay. We're short on fans, and it wouldn't be surprising if the refrigerator died any moment.\\" I wanted to install South Korea's excellent air conditioners, but the Marshall Islands lacked proper technicians and had many issues with electricity supply. The employees all held fans and smiled happily. \\"Wow, now we can live like humans! Sung-guk, thank you so much!\\" Tom also cheered. \\"Don't mention it. These are just the first batch of items. More home appliances will arrive in a week.\\" At that moment, Jim's cheering voice was heard. \\"My goodness! What's all this!\\" A truck loaded with beer and various fishing gear was coming in. The man driving the truck got down and shouted to the employees. \\"Come on, help me if you want to drink beer!\\" At his words, all the employees rolled up their sleeves and rushed to the truck. The beer that filled the truck was quickly moved to the Space Z office. The employees popped open cans before even putting them in the refrigerator. Click. Elon also opened a can of beer next to me. \\"Sung-guk, when can I legally drink beer with you?\\" \\"Just wait a few more years.\\" I smiled and drank cold water. It was a day when sweat dripped down even without doing anything. But today, everyone happily moved stuff and drank beer. Jim was the most excited to start moving things. Elon, after gulping down his beer, grabbed my shoulder. \\"Sung-guk, beer is something you can just consume and forget, but refrigerators, fans... and even washing machines. Isn't it too much to provide such expensive appliances? We'll all go back to the US once the launch succeeds.\\" I shrugged. \\"When we go to the US, we'll sell them all second-hand. Korean home appliances are popular, so they'll sell easily.\\" \\"We're leaving soon anyway.\\" Elon shook his head. [Elon, by the time these products become second-hand, Space X will have succeeded. Just accept it.] * * * I finally started packing my bags. It was time to leave the Marshall Islands. Not only the mattresses Jim wanted but also beer and various home appliances had arrived. The employees began to work in a much better environment. Jim approached me as I was packing. \\"Sung-guk, are you really leaving?\\" \\"I've done my job, so I have to leave.\\" \\"Going back to the US?\\" \\"Yes...\\" Jim looked regretful. \\"When's your flight?\\" \\"9 AM the day after tomorrow.\\" \\"I'll drive you there.\\" \\"Thank you, Jim...\\" Even after saying everything, Jim lingered in my room. \\"Jim, is there something you want to say?\\" \\"Well, Sung-guk, I don't have anything to buy here. This is my gift to you.\\" Jim handed me a blueprint. \\"Jim, what's this?\\" \\"It's the first spacecraft I designed. Of course, it's not classified or anything. I did it during a class in college.\\" \\"Then, it's very precious to you.\\" \\"I was about to give up on that precious dream, but because of Sung-guk, I was able to keep it. If I hadn't met Sung-guk... I might have bought a plane ticket to the US by now.\\" I quickly took the blueprint. \\"Jim, I'll cherish your gift.\\" \\"Sung-guk... You have to update your 'Face Note' often. I live here looking forward to Sung-guk's 'Face Note'.\\" \\"Jim, you often post about your fishing. I think I'll miss the fish I caught on this island so much once I leave.\\" \\"The shark we missed too?\\" \\"It's not missed; that shark is being managed in the fishery.\\" \\"Ah, right!\\" Jim smiled broadly. I quickly packed the blueprint in my bag. * * * Elon and Jim accompanied me to the airport. Elon, driving an old truck, talked non-stop. \\"Sung-guk, South Korean home appliances are really the best. When I go back to the US, I'll have to replace all the appliances in my house with Korean products.\\" \\"Elon, just tell me. I'll recommend them to you.\\" [I'm a model for Samsung, and the products sponsored by Hyojin Group are all good. Home appliances are definitely Korea's forte.] Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. The truck continued to shake. \\"Sung-guk, if you're going back to the US, will you focus on 'Face Note' again?\\" \\"For now, yes.\\" \\"Then you'll concentrate on 'Face Note' again?\\" \\"I'll do what I can, but now I'm thinking of investing in new companies.\\" \\"New companies?\\" \\"Companies that open the future, like Space Z.\\" I smiled. 'Face Note' is making me a global billionaire. Then, it's time to invest in a company that will make our family wealthy. Min-guk will become a member of a global idol group, so platforms like YouTube and 'Face Note' are absolutely necessary to showcase Min-guk's talent. In the future, SNS will be crucial for becoming not only a national but also a global singer. And although I haven't asked Ji-hee yet, I'm thinking of investing in the medical field for Ji-hee, who will become a representative doctor of South Korea. Just then, Peter contacted me about a very interesting company. Jim looked at me as if I were an idol. \\"Sung-guk will do well in everything.\\" \\"Jim, don't praise me too much. I make a lot of mistakes too.\\" \\"Sung-guk, if you ever have a hard time, come to the Marshall Islands and fish with me.\\" \\"I'll come on vacation, so let's fish together then.\\" At my words, Elon honked the horn loudly. \\"Sung-guk, we'll escape the Marshall Islands within a year!\\" \\"Got it, Elon!\\" [Please succeed quickly! That way, as an investor, I can also make some money!] * * * Mark hugged me tightly. \\"Sung-guk, it's the first time we haven't seen each other for so long, isn't it?\\" [Mark, don't exaggerate. When I was a trainee in Korea, we couldn't see each other for a month.] \\"Mark, have you been taking good care of 'Face Note'?\\" \\"Of course. Don't I look quite like a CEO?\\" Mark was wearing a checkered shirt as usual. \\"It suits you.\\" \\"By the way, Sung-guk. Are you going to stay with 'Face Note' now?\\" \\"Hmm... It seems like I will, but can you give me an office?\\" \\"Why not? You're also a co-CEO.\\" \\"Actually, I have something I want to do...\\" \\"What do you want to do?\\" \\"I want to start investing in various companies seriously.\\" Mark's face fell. \\"Sung-guk, can't you focus only on 'Face Note'?\\" \\"Mark, I need to invest in various routes so that if 'Face Note' ever faces financial difficulties, I can help 'Face Note'.\\" [This is the structure of a South Korean chaebol, Mark.] Of course, South Korean chaebols grow by monopolizing every industry with their octopus-like reach. But I plan to invest in promising companies, make profits, and then reinvest in the industries I want. Mark smiled resignedly. \\"How can I win against you? By the way, Peter said he wants to go to a party today. He contacted us to wear suits.\\" \\"Hmm... Mark, do you have a suit?\\" \\"I looked at the one I wore for our high school graduation yesterday, and Mimi said it was so outdated that I absolutely shouldn't wear it. She said I should spend some money now that I'm making it.\\" \\"Korean women are scary, aren't they?\\" \\"Scary, but that's also their charm.\\" Mark was completely smitten with Limi. \\"Mark, then shall we go shopping for clothes for the first time in a while?\\" \\"Sounds good!\\" Mark, in his checkered shirt, and I, in my usual hoodie, headed to the department store. * * * I confidently entered the luxury brand store on the first floor of the department store. Mark followed me, grumbling. \\"Sung-guk, even though we're now properly receiving investments and CEO salaries, this place is too expensive.\\" [I haven't shopped anywhere but here since I became a chaebol...] I scratched my head. \\"Mark, I'll buy you clothes. I have a salary, but I also make profits from investments.\\" \\"Sung-guk, even though I've known you for a long time, I feel like I'm looking at a completely different person in moments like this.\\" \\"Since we're wearing suits for the first time in a while, let's go for something nice.\\" I entered the Gucci brand led by Tom Ford. [Tom Ford's Gucci has that sexy appeal.] I looked through Gucci's men's collection with satisfaction. Mark awkwardly followed me. \\"Sung-guk, this place doesn't seem to match my image at all.\\" \\"Mark, just trust me and try it on. You'll be a hit tonight.\\" Then, a tall blonde female clerk approached us with a stiff face and scanned us from head to toe. \\"Do you need help finding something?\\" Her voice already sounded displeased. \\"Please show us this season's men's suits.\\" \\"For both of you?\\" \\"Yes. We need clothes for a party tonight.\\" I took out a card from my wallet and showed it to the clerk. It was the black card issued only to the top 1% in the US. The clerk's attitude changed immediately upon seeing the card, and she quickly lowered her posture. \\"Would you like something to drink? How about champagne?\\" \\"I'll just have water. Mark?\\" \\"I'll take the champagne.\\" \\"Alright, please follow me.\\" The clerk led us to the VIP room and soon served water and champagne. \\"Please wait a moment. I'll prepare the Gucci collection for you.\\" As the clerk left, Mark poked my side. \\"Sung-guk, where did you get that card?\\" \\"Uh... I bought a lot of home appliances and other stuff for investing in Space Z. Then the card company confirmed I was the 'Face Note' representative and gave it to me?\\" \\"Wow...\\" I shrugged. The issuance of the black card was based not only on wealth but also on the recognition of 'Face Note' in the US. Soon, the clerk returned with Gucci's men's line. I quickly chose the outfit that seemed to suit me best. [The chaebol's eye for fashion hasn't faded.] * * * As we entered the hotel in San Francisco where the party was held, all eyes turned to us. Mark felt uncomfortable and kept fiddling with his shirt buttons. \\"Sung-guk, everyone's looking at us.\\" \\"Not us, me. So don't be too nervous, Mark.\\" \\"Anyway, you're hopeless.\\" Then, Peter, who invited us, came over with a bright smile. \\"Sung-guk! Mark! How long has it been? You both look fantastic tonight?\\" \\"Thanks for the compliment.\\" Peter patted Mark's shoulder. \\"Mark looks pretty good too.\\" \\"Peter, I'll just eat something delicious here and go.\\" \\"Mark, you're also a CEO of 'Face Note' now. You should enjoy these gatherings. This party is filled with influential people from Silicon Valley. Get to know their faces. We'll have a lot of dealings with them in the future.\\" Peter quietly came up to me. \\"Sung-guk, there's someone I want to introduce you to today.\\" \\"The Charlie Jobs of the medical field you mentioned?\\" \\"Yes. He dropped out of Stanford and is working on a venture company that develops diagnostic kits capable of testing various diseases with just a drop of blood.\\" [Wait a minute...] I stopped in my tracks and frowned. Suddenly, a familiar face appeared in front of me and extended a hand. \\"Oh, are you Sung-guk from 'Face Note'?\\" [Ah- Enemies meet on a narrow road. Ashley Holmes?] Ashley Holmes smiled at me, unaware of anything. I firmly shook Ashley Holmes's hand. \\"Hello. I'm Sung-guk.\\" \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from Blood Therapy!\\""},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Did you know that Lego started out from a carpenter’s simple business of selling household items and wooden toys during The Great Depression? It was a company that only made wooden dolls, blocks, rocking horses & marionettes. But one day, in the year 1949, its founder began making interlocking plastic cubes which had studs on the top and were hollow underneath which he called Automatic Binding Bricks. We now know them as Lego Bricks, or simply, Lego. Lego is made from high quality materials that are safe for children to play with. As children build Lego creations, it allows them to establish a sense of accomplishment, pride and build on their self-confidence and self-belief, whether it be through following instructions, or from forming an idea in their own mind. When we play with lego it allows us to engage in a building process that enhances their creativity. Fine motor skills, finger strength and dexterity are developed when playing with Lego, encouraging children to try more complex tasks as they go along. I think Lego toys promote creativity because they stimulate your creative thinking and problem-solving abilities. I believe Lego also helps with learning because it provides a way to master different kinds of emerging skills, such as problem solving, spatial skills and understanding semi-complex tasks. I think Lego produces teamwork and collaboration of shared social skills, reinforcing positive behavior and social contact. Lego helps children to develop their mathematical skills and spatial awareness, and encourages them how to problem solve and come up with new ideas or solutions. A child's time with Lego involves a great deal of cooperation and creativity, which helps to develop their cognitive skills and abilities starting from a very young age. By encouraging creativity, problem-solving, teamwork, and persistence, Lego can help children develop important skills that they can use throughout their lives as they mature. Lego is a well-known brand that creates space and construction toys for children to engage with. Allow me to share with you a little history of these colorful building blocks. The LEGO® Company was founded by Ole Kirk Kristiansen in Billund, Denmark, in 1932. He was an out-of-work carpenter who needed money to support his family during The Great Depression. His business was simply trying to make ends meet by selling household items and the wooden toys he created. By 1933, Mr. Christiansen enjoyed creating these products that were very much in demand, so he decided to become a full-time toy maker. His small business is now his new company named “Lego” which was derived from two Danish words, leg godt meaning “play well.” By 1946, as the company evolved, it started creating wooden and plastic bricks for Denmark as its sole market. One day in 1949, he began making these interlocking plastic cubes which had studs on the top but were hollow underneath, he called them Automatic Binding Bricks. These bricks were now sold in toy stores all over Europe. Throughout the 1950s, LEGO® continued to expand, as it developed its patented and now-classic interlocking “stud-and-tube” design.He changed the name to Lego Bricks in 1954 and eventually to just Legos as we know today. By 1971, Legos were the most loved and bestselling toys among US children. There are hotels called LegoLand in Denmark, England, California, Florida and Japan. Legos are more than just blocks.They are so versatile ranging from simply following their designs to creating Lego people, trees, animals and buildings so you can build your own Lego world, and even to the extent of recreating famous movies or characters. As children build with Legos, it allows them to establish a sense of accomplishment, pride and build on their self-confidence and self-belief, whether it be through following instructions, or by forming an idea in their own mind. When children follow a given set of instructions to decipher order, understand the quantity, symmetry and patterns, and locate the bricks, it helps them develop their mathematical skills and spatial awareness; and it encourages them to develop problem-solving abilities,or come up with new ideas. Lego provides learning by creating a way for children to start mastering different kinds of emerging skills, such as problem solving, spatial skills and understanding semi-complex tasks. Playing with Legos can initially be frustrating when they break apart; however with repeated playing, it can actually help children develop perseverance knowing that their masterpieces can be rebuilt,their errors can be fixed and some fallen pieces can be replaced or reattached to where they came from. Children find excitement and motivation when they complete building their Lego. There is a large sense of accomplishment involved which makes them happy with what they have produced, and allows them to value their hard work. Playing with Legos allows opportunities for trying out new ideas without a fear of failure, letting children know they can manage and overcome unexpected things. Building with Legos can take time and test a child’s patience, like when that final Lego piece goes missing for example. The situation can help children understand that any building process takes hard work and time in order to get good results. When children play with Lego it allows them to become creative and makes them build anything. Lego also helps children develop fine motor skills, finger strength and dexterity are developed when playing with Lego, encouraging children to try more complex tasks as they go along. The varied amounts of pressure used to assemble them can be good exercise for the small fingers, helping children hold a pencil and control the pressure used during building. In a society where many children are experts at typing on computer monitors,or swiping on their tablets and smartphones, the opportunity to develop these fine motor skills is extremely important. Playing with Legos allows an opportunity to try out new ideas without a fear of failure, so children can figure out troubleshooting skills to fix errors or replace fallen pieces, helping them realize that even if situations might not have worked out just as planned, they can manage and overcome them. Legos are fun to play with as you learn. I believe that a child's time with Lego involves a great deal of cooperation and creativity, which helps them develop their cognitive skills and abilities from a very young age. Playing with Legos allows opportunities for trying out new ideas without a fear of failure, letting children know they can manage and overcome unexpected things.

Lego creations are a form of art as children can become creators and story makers when given the opportunity to release their creativity, imagination and self-expression. A child's time with Lego involves a great deal of cooperation and creativity, which helps to develop their cognitive skills and abilities starting from a very young age. By encouraging creativity, problem-solving, teamwork, and persistence, Lego can help children develop important skills that they can use throughout their lives as they mature. That’s why in my opinion Lego promotes creativity in children as they learn to master important skills starting at a young age which they can use in their lives as they get older.","completion":"This text exhibits characteristics that suggest it could have been written by an AI. Here are some reasons for this assessment: 1. **Repetitiveness:** The text frequently repeats the same points about Lego helping with creativity, fine motor skills, cognitive development, and problem-solving abilities in children. A human writer is more likely to vary their language more or avoid repeating the same points in such close proximity. 2. **Lack of Personal Touch:** Even though the text occasionally uses phrases like \\"I think\\" or \\"I believe,\\" it lacks personal anecdotes or specific examples that a human writer might include when sharing their thoughts on a topic based on personal experience. These phrases seem more like an attempt to mimic a human-like perspective rather than genuine personal insight. 3. **Structural Redundancies:** The text revisits its structure multiple times, starting with a brief history of Lego, followed by its benefits for children, and concluding with a personal opinion that reiterates previously stated benefits. This cyclical structure, without clear progression or new insights, is more characteristic of AI trying to fulfill a length requirement or keyword density rather than a human constructing a cohesive argument or narrative. 4. **Surface-Level Information:** While the text provides a general overview of Lego's history and benefits, it lacks the depth or unique insights that might come from an expert or enthusiast's perspective. It mainly sticks to well-known facts and benefits that could easily be found in general sources or promotional materials. 5. **Generalized Statements:** The text makes several broad, generalized statements about the benefits of Lego without delving into specifics or providing evidence. While humans might also make generalized statements, in a more detailed or analytical piece, one would expect some level of specificity or examples to support such claims. Considering these points, there's a good chance this text was generated by an AI designed to compile general information on a topic into a cohesive piece. However, without further context about the origin of the text, it's not possible to say with absolute certainty."},{"prompt":"Rectify grammar in below Tex.AW 1 page I NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER Always make those above you feel comfortably superior In your desire to please or impress them, do not go toofar in displayingyour talent: oryou might accomplish the oppasite~»—-inspirefear and insecurity.

[스페이스 Z도 접수!] * * * 짐은 빨간 머리를 긁적이며 직원들 앞에서 섰다. “제가 너무 놀라게 해드렸죠? 우선 죄송합니다.” “짐, 어디를 간다면 간다고 해야지!” 톰은 여전히 짜증 섞인 어조로 짐을 나무랐다. “톰, 미안해요. 그냥 전….” 일론이 얼른 나섰다. “톰, 이건 짜증 낼 일이 아니잖아. 짐이 이렇게 무사히 돌아온 게 얼마나 다행이야. 솔직히 여자 친구가 다른 사람을 만난다는데 꼭지가 안 돌 남자가 어디 있어. 심지어 우리는 마셜 제도에 있잖아.” 짐은 귀까지 빨개졌다. “일론, 그리고 톰… 정말 다 미안해요. 성국한테도요.” 일론은 얼른 짐에게 어깨동무를 했다. “짐, 우선 오늘은 푹 쉬어. 이상한 생각하는 건 아니지?” “일론, 절대 아니에요. 저한테는 소중한 가족이 있는데요.” 톰도 일단 짐의 어깨를 다독였다. “그래, 짐. 우리한테는 소중한 가족이 있잖아. 나도 와이프 얼굴 못 본 지 세 달이 넘었어.” “미안해요, 톰.” “오늘은 푹 쉬고, 내일 일은 내일 생각해 보자고.” “네….” 짐은 잔뜩 주눅이 들어서 대답했다. 나는 얼른 짐에게 다가갔다. “짐, 낚시나 갈래요?” “성국, 근데 그 댓글은 너무한 거 아니에요. 우리 엄마를 팔면 어떻게 해요? 엄마한테 무슨 일 생긴 줄 알고, 놀랐잖아요.” “짐한테 당장 연락 올 방법이 그것밖에 없는 것 같아서요. 미안해요. 대신, 오늘 맥주는 내가 무제한으로 살게요.” “치이… 그거면 용서해줄게요.” 짐은 조금 기운을 차리는 듯했다. 일론이 나와 짐의 어깨에 팔을 걸었다. “성국, 짐. 둘이 낚시하면서 오늘은 좀 쉬어. 이따, 저녁에 나도 맥주 마시러 갈게. 내 것 좀 남겨줘, 알았지?” “물론이죠, 일론.” 나는 찡긋 윙크를 했다. * * * 짐은 낚싯대를 들고 성큼성큼 앞장섰다. 잔잔한 파도가 치는 바닷가는 정말 환상적인 모습이었다. 길게 늘어진 야자수 아래에 우리는 자리를 잡았다. 적당한 그늘과 바람. 정말 이곳은 천국이었다. “짐, 이렇게 좋은 데를 그동안 혼자만 안 거예요?” “여긴 내 아지트거든요. 혼자 있고 싶을 때, 그냥 여기서 몇 시간이고 박혀 있다 보면 모든 게 정리되는 기분이 들어서요. 아무한테도 알려주지 않았어요. 알려주면 아지트가 아니잖아요.” “오늘 그 시간을 저희가 방해했네요. 미안해요.” “아니에요. 오해할 만도 했죠. 여자친구가 다른 남자랑 사귄다는 메시지를 보고는 사라졌으니. 다들 놀랐을 거예요.” 우리는 적당한 곳에 자리를 잡고는 아이스박스에 잔뜩 챙겨온 맥주와 생수를 꺼내 들었다. 짐은 맥주를 마시더니 기분 좋게 바다를 바라봤다. “진짜 여기는 천국 같아요.” “짐, 근데 천국이 재미있을까요?” “성국. 진짜는 재미가 없어서 여기가 천국 같은 거예요.” 짐은 씁쓸하게 웃었다. 그리고는 맥주는 몇 번 더 들이켰다. 나는 깡생수를 들이켜며 입질 한번 없는 낚싯대를 끈질기게 바라보며 시간을 보냈다. 짐도 한동안 말이 없다가 드디어 입을 열었다. “성국, 사실은 여자친구한테 다른 남자가 생긴 것보다 더 생각할 일이 있었어요.” “그게 뭔데요?” “다른 회사에서 스카우트 제의가 왔어요.” [흠… 고민될 만하네.….] 스페이스 Z에서 딱 눈 감고 5년만 보내면 어느 정도 보상은 보장되고, 딱 10년만 버티면 억만장자가 된다. 하지만 20대에게 앞으로 딱 10년만 스페이스 Z에서 미친 듯이 일만 하면 당신은 부자가 될 것입니다, 라고 말한다면 누가 좋아할까? 짐이 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 난 성국의 열성팬이잖아요. 만약 성국이 나와 같은 입장이라면, 어떻게 할 것 같아요?” “흠….” 나는 잠시 고민했다. 내가 하는 말은 모두 천기누설이다. 사실 이 세상에서 나만 알고, 나만 잘 먹고 잘살면 되는 문제이다. 하지만 지금의 짐에게는 내 천기누설이 조금 필요해 보였다. 짐은 그사이에도 맥주를 벌컥벌컥 마셨다. 옆으로 벌써 맥주캔이 꽤 나뒹굴고 있었다. “짐, 내가 만약 짐이라면요. 전 스페이스 Z에 인생을 걸어볼 거예요.” “정말요?” “네.” 나는 작게 고개를 끄덕였다. 그리고 천천히 말을 이었다. “만약, 짐이 스페이스 Z를 벗어나서 스카우트된 회사로 간다면 뭐가 보장되죠?” “실리콘밸리의 안정적인 연봉과 안정적인 직장. 그리고 뭐, 주말마다 데이트 상대를 찾아 나서겠죠. 그러다 어느 날, 마음에 드는 상대가 나타나면 연애를 하고… 아이를 낳고… 그렇게 늙어가겠죠.” 짐은 말을 하면서도 점점 기운이 빠졌다. “짐, 5년 후면 몇 살이죠?” “29살이요.” [NASA에 제대로 된 투자 받으려면 적어도 5년은 걸리니까… 짐, 이제부터 내 말 가슴에 새겨. 이거 정말 아무한테나 해주는 거 아니야.] 나는 깡생수를 벌컥 들이키곤 바다를 응시했다. “짐… 내가 만약 짐이라면 20대는 한번 이 회사에 걸어보겠어요. 만약 5년 후에도 이 회사가 전혀 가망이 없다면, 그땐 30살의 인생을 다시 시작해도 늦지 않을 거예요. 인생이라는 20대 때는 20대가 끝나면 모든 게 끝날 것 같지만, 그 이후의 인생은 더 길잖아요.” “성국, ‘페이스 노트’ 볼 때도 느꼈지만. 사실은 뭐 출생신고가 잘못되거나 그런 거죠? 10대 아니죠?” [저번 생에 마흔에 요절하고, 이번 생에서는 이제 한국 나이로 15살이니….] “조금 있으면 육십이에요.” “말도 안 돼.” 짐은 피식 웃고는 바다를 다시 응시했다. “딱 5년이라… 이 망망대해에서 5년이라….” 짐은 여전히 미래에 대해서 확신이 안 서는 모양이었다. [짐, 여자 친구한테 차여서 내가 선심 쓰는 거야.] “짐, 만약에 스페이스 Z에 어떤 복지가 생기면 여기 마셜 제도에 남아서 계속 일할 거 같아요?” “흠…” 짐은 잠시 행복한 눈으로 상상의 나래를 펼쳤다. 그리고 드디어 입을 열었다. “흠… 일주일에 딱 반나절 이렇게 낚시하면서 맥주 마실 자유와… 그리고 일 년에 딱 한 번 집으로 휴가 갈 때 이코노미 말고 비즈니스 좌석을 제공해주고… 풉. 성국, 상상만 해도 좋은데요?” “그거면 정말 여기 남을 거예요?” “아, 또 하나 더 있어요.” “뭔데요?” “침대 매트리스 좀 바꿔줬으면 좋겠어요. 지금 매트리스는 정말 최악이에요!” “흠… 그거 제가 모두 해드릴게요.” “네에? 성국이요?” “네. 제가 이제부터 스페이스 Z의 투자자가 될 거거든요.” 이때, 낚시찌가 위아래로 요동쳤다. “짐! 대어인가 봐요! 좀 도와줘요!” “성국, 어서 대를 꽉 잡아요!” 우리는 동시에 낚싯대를 꽉 잡았다. 그리고 있는 힘껏 낚싯대를 잡아 올렸다. * * * “뭐야? 한 마리도 못 잡은 거야?” 뒤늦게 도착한 일론이 텅 빈 양동이를 보며 중얼거렸다. “일론, 우리가 좀 전에 저랑 성국이랑 상어를 낚았거든요.” “상어? 어디 있어?” 나는 넓게 펼쳐진 바다를 손가락으로 가리켰다. “바다에 있죠. 양동이에 상어를 담기에는 너무 벅차잖아요.” 일론은 어이없는 얼굴로 나를 봤다. “성국, 그럼 결국 놓친 거 아니야?” “놓친 게 아니라 바다라는 양동이에 상어를 담아놓은 거죠. 필요할 때 또 낚게요.” “암튼 꿈보다 해몽이 좋아.” 일론은 짐을 쳐다봤다. “짐, 마음은 좀 정리됐어?” “네, 일론. 걱정시켜서 미안해요. 앞으로 그런 일 없을 거예요. 참, 성국이 저희 회사에 투자하는 거 사실이에요?” 일론이 잠시 당황스러운 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. [일론, 약속은 지켜야지.] “참, 일론 우리 이야기도 정리해요.” “어, 성국….” 우리는 짐을 두고 잠시 바닷가를 걸었다. “성국, 도대체 짐에게 무슨 이야기를 한 거야?” “일론, 스페이스 Z에 짐은 정말 필요한 인재 맞죠?” “당연하지. 짐이 없으면 스페이스 Z 한 축이 사라지는 거나 마찬가지야.” “짐이 오늘 생각할 시간이 필요했던 것은 스카우트 제의가 있어서였어요.” 일론의 얼굴이 일그러졌다. “일론, 걱정 말아요. 내가 짐이 원하는 요구 조건을 모두 들어주기로 하고 스페이스 Z에 잡아뒀거든요.” “그게 뭔데, 성국?” “일주일 중 반나절 낚시할 시간과 맥주. 그리고 휴가 때 집에 가는 비즈니스 왕복 항공권. 마지막으로… 침대 매트리스 교체요.” “우린 그럴 돈이 없는데….” 일론은 당황했다. “일론, 나랑 약속했잖아요. 짐을 돌아오게 하면 스페이스 Z에 투자하게 해주겠다고요. 짐의 요구 조건은 제가 스페이스 Z에 투자하는 첫걸음이 될 거예요.” 나는 씨익 미소를 지었다.","completion":"Episode 173 All former employees of Space Z and I gathered to discuss Jim's whereabouts. Tom scratched his greasy hair. \\"Well, given the situation, wouldn't he naturally have gone to the airport? Elon, what do you think?\\" \\"That's right. He must have rushed to see his girlfriend.\\" However, I had a different thought. Even when he borrowed a fishing rod in the morning, Jim had an indifferent expression on his face. As always, he was exhausted, starting his day with a cup of coffee. His biggest concern this morning was whether to trim his beard a bit. \\"Elon, if he went to the airport, wouldn't he have taken something like a passport or ID?\\" At my words, a colleague hurriedly checked Jim's room. \\"He left everything behind. No, he didn't take anything.\\" At this moment, Tom's face turned serious. \\"This guy... surely, he's not thinking of something bad?\\" Elon's brow furrowed. \\"That shouldn't be...\\" Elon looked at me. \\"Sung-guk, didn't you say earlier that there was a way to find Jim?\\" \\"Hmm... Yes. For now, I'll stay here and make sure Jim comes back. Just in case, everyone else, please go out and look for Jim.\\" Tom looked at me with an annoyed face. From the first day he arrived at Space Z, Tom had not taken kindly to me. He thought of me as someone who came to enjoy a vacation, boasting about being the founder of \\"Face Note\\" and working 24 hours a day alongside them. \\"Elon, what the heck. In the end, it's us who have to run around.\\" \\"Tom. We don't have time for this now. Let's find Jim first, and we can talk about right and wrong later.\\" \\"Ah...\\" Tom left the office with the employees. Elon looked at me with a slightly disappointed face. \\"Sung-guk, you said earlier that there was a solution.\\" \\"There is.\\" I opened my laptop and logged into \\"Face Note.\\" Elon scratched his forehead. \\"Sung-guk, are you just going to post about Jim's disappearance on 'Face Note'? This is the Marshall Islands. How many people do you think use 'Face Note' here?\\" \\"......\\" I didn't respond to Elon's words and just left a post on Jim's \\"Face Note.\\" - Jim, your mother is desperately looking for you. Please come back to the Space Z office. Elon's brow furrowed even more. \\"Sung-guk, what are you doing?\\" \\"Elon, you said there's also a military in South Korea, right? Trust me for once. By the way, Jim took his laptop and phone. I think... he might have just gone into hiding rather than trying to die.\\" \\"Sung-guk, I hope you're right...\\" Elon's words lacked confidence. Of course, I wasn't confident either. If Jim doesn't come back even after doing this, my investment in Space Z would fail. At the same time, I might have to leave this place and go back to \\"Face Note\\" or even return to South Korea to spend a difficult time with Bang Mu-hyuk. What I was counting on was that Jim had talked a lot about his girlfriend and his parents who raised him, especially his mother, over the past week. And whether in South Korea or the United States, men in their 20s still need their mothers. Elon grabbed a bottle of water and left the office. \\"Sung-guk, I'll go look for Jim with the employees.\\" \\"I'll wait here for Jim's contact.\\" \\"Alright...\\" Elon sighed deeply and left. * * * My phone rang loudly. It hadn't even been 10 minutes since I posted on Jim's \\"Face Note.\\" I quickly checked the caller ID. Of course, it was Jim. I answered the phone with a calm voice. From the other end of the phone, Jim's anxious voice came through. - Sung-guk, what's going on? Why is my mom looking for me? \\"Jim, where are you right now? Everyone here is in a frenzy because you disappeared.\\" - That's... I'm sorry. I just wanted to be alone for a bit.... \\"First, come back to the office. Then we'll talk.\\" - Yes, I'll be there soon. I quickly called Elon. \\"Elon, Jim is coming back to the office.\\" - Really, Sung-guk? \\"Elon, how about giving Jim a few days off when he comes back?\\" - Alright, let's talk about that after meeting Jim. I'll rush to the office. I hung up the phone. And I grinned. [Space Z, check!] * * * Jim, scratching his red hair, stood in front of the employees. \\"I'm really sorry for startling everyone.\\" \\"Jim, you should have said something if you were going somewhere!\\" Tom scolded Jim with an annoyed tone. \\"Tom, I'm sorry. I just...\\" Elon quickly intervened. \\"Tom, this isn't something to get angry about. It's fortunate that Jim came back safely. Honestly, which man wouldn't go crazy if his girlfriend was seeing someone else? Especially since we're in the Marshall Islands.\\" Jim's face turned red. \\"Elon, and Tom... I'm really sorry. And to Sung-guk too.\\" Elon quickly put his arm around Jim. \\"Jim, just rest for today. You're not thinking of anything strange, are you?\\" \\"Elon, absolutely not. I have a precious family.\\" Tom also patted Jim's shoulder for now. \\"That's right, Jim. We have precious families. I haven't seen my wife's face in over three months.\\" \\"I'm sorry, Tom.\\" \\"Let's rest today and think about tomorrow's work tomorrow.\\" \\"Yes...\\" Jim answered with a subdued voice. I quickly approached Jim. \\"Jim, want to go fishing?\\" \\"Sung-guk, but that comment was too much. What if something happened to my mom? I was shocked thinking something happened to her.\\" \\"I thought it was the only way to get in touch with you immediately. Sorry. But today, I'll buy unlimited beer.\\" \\"Chi... I'll forgive you for that.\\" Jim seemed to cheer up a bit. Elon put his arm around me and Jim. \\"Sung-guk, Jim. Take a break today and go fishing. I'll come drink beer later in the evening. Save some for me, okay?\\" \\"Of course, Elon.\\" I winked slyly. * * * Jim led the way with a fishing rod in hand. The beach, with its gentle waves, looked truly fantastic. We set up our spot under the long palm trees. The perfect shade and breeze. This place was indeed heaven. \\"Jim, have you been keeping this wonderful place to yourself all this time?\\" \\"This is my hideout. When I want to be alone, just burying myself here for a few hours makes me feel like everything is sorted out. I haven't told anyone. If I did, it wouldn't be a hideout anymore.\\" \\"Sorry for intruding on your time today.\\" \\"No, it's understandable. After seeing the message that my girlfriend was seeing another guy and then disappearing, everyone must have been shocked.\\" We found a suitable spot and took out plenty of beer and water from the icebox. Jim drank his beer and happily looked at the sea. \\"This place really is like heaven.\\" \\"Jim, but would heaven be fun?\\" \\"Sung-guk. The real thing is boring, that's why this place feels like heaven.\\" Jim smiled bitterly. And then he drank a few more beers. I gulped down my water, stubbornly watching the fishing rod that hadn't had a single bite, passing the time. After a while of silence, Jim finally spoke. \\"Sung-guk, actually, there was something more to think about than my girlfriend seeing another guy.\\" \\"What was it?\\" \\"I got a scout offer from another company.\\" [Hmm… That would be a dilemma...] If you just close your eyes and spend 5 years at Space Z, you're somewhat guaranteed a reward, and if you endure for just 10 years, you become a millionaire. But if you tell someone in their 20s that if they just work like crazy at Space Z for the next 10 years, they'll become rich, who would like that? Jim looked at me. \\"Sung-guk, I'm a big fan of yours. If you were in my position, what would you do?\\" \\"Hmm...\\" I pondered for a moment. Everything I say is a revelation. In fact, in this world, it's enough if only I know and live well. But it seemed like my revelation was a bit necessary for Jim right now. Jim continued to gulp down his beer in the meantime. Several beer cans were already rolling around next to him. \\"Jim, if I were you, I'd bet my life on Space Z.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I nodded slightly. And then slowly continued. \\"If Jim leaves Space Z and goes to the scouted company, what's guaranteed?\\" \\"A stable salary and job in Silicon Valley. And well, probably looking for a date every weekend. Then one day, if a suitable partner appears, start a relationship... have children... and grow old like that.\\" As Jim spoke, his energy seemed to drain. \\"Jim, how old will you be in 5 years?\\" \\"29.\\" [It'll take at least 5 years to get proper investment from NASA... Jim, remember what I'm about to say. I don't give this advice to just anyone.] I gulped down my water and stared at the sea. \\"Jim... If I were Jim, I'd take a chance on this company in my 20s. If, after 5 years, this company still has no prospects, then it's not too late to start life over at 30. It might seem like everything ends when your 20s are over, but life after that is longer.\\" \\"성국, you always felt like a revelation when I saw 'Face Note.' Are you sure you weren't mistakenly registered at birth? You're not a teenager, right?\\" [In my previous life, I died in my forties, and in this life, I'm... 15 in Korean age...] \\"I'm almost sixty.\\" \\"No way.\\" Jim chuckled and then gazed back at the sea. \\"Just 5 years... in this vast sea...\\" Jim still seemed unsure about his future. [Jim, I'm being generous because you got dumped by your girlfriend.] \\"Jim, if Space Z had some kind of welfare, would you stay here and continue working?\\" \\"Hmm...\\" Jim imagined happily for a moment and then finally spoke. \\"Hmm... If I could fish and drink beer for half a day once a week... and if they provided a business class round trip ticket home once a year for vacation... Pfft. Sung-guk, just imagining it feels great, you know?\\" \\"Would you really stay here for that?\\" \\"Oh, there's one more thing.\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"I wish they'd change the mattress. The current mattress is the worst!\\" \\"Hmm... I'll take care of all that for you.\\" \\"Me? Sung-guk?\\" \\"Yes. I'm going to become an investor in Space Z from now on.\\" At that moment, the fishing float bobbed up and down. \\"Jim! It might be a big one! Help me!\\" \\"Sung-guk, hold the rod tight!\\" We both grabbed the fishing rod tightly. And with all our might, we pulled up the rod. * * * \\"What? You didn't catch a single one?\\" Elon, who arrived late, muttered as he looked at the empty bucket. \\"Elon, we just caught a shark with Sung-guk.\\" \\"Shark? Where is it?\\" I pointed to the vast sea with my finger. \\"It's in the sea. The bucket is too small to hold a shark.\\" Elon looked at me incredulously. \\"Sung-guk, so you let it go in the end?\\" \\"It's not that we let it go; we kept the shark in the sea, which is like a bucket. We can catch it again when we need it.\\" \\"Anyway, the interpretation is better than the dream.\\" Elon looked at Jim. \\"Jim, have you sorted out your thoughts?\\" \\"Yes, Elon. I'm sorry for worrying you. It won't happen again. By the way, is it true that Sung-guk is investing in our company?\\" Elon looked at me with a puzzled expression for a moment. [Elon, you have to keep your promises.] \\"Let's sort out our story, Elon.\\" \\"Uh, Sung-guk...\\" We left Jim behind and walked along the beach for a while. \\"Sung-guk, what exactly did you tell Jim?\\" \\"Elon, Jim is really a necessary talent for Space Z, right?\\" \\"Of course. Without Jim, it's like losing one pillar of Space Z.\\" \\"Jim needed time to think today because he had a scout offer.\\" Elon's face twisted. \\"Elon, don't worry. I've agreed to meet all of Jim's requested conditions and kept him at Space Z.\\" \\"What were those conditions, Sung-guk?\\" \\"A half-day of fishing and beer once a week, a business class round trip ticket home for vacation once a year, and... changing the mattress.\\" \\"We don't have the money for that...\\" Elon was flustered. \\"Elon, you promised me. If I brought Jim back, you'd let me invest in Space Z. Jim's requested conditions will be the first step of my investment in Space Z.\\" I grinned."},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"Elon looked at me, a mix of surprise and relief washing over his face. \\"Alright, Sung-guk. If you're willing to cover those conditions, then it's a deal. But are you sure? This is a big commitment.\\" \\"I'm sure, Elon. Investing in people is the best investment one can make. And Jim is worth it. Plus, this is an investment in Space Z's future, too.\\" Elon nodded, still a bit in disbelief but visibly relieved. \\"Thank you, Sung-guk. I... we owe you one. This means a lot to us, especially at this critical time.\\" \\"Don't mention it. Just make sure Space Z reaches its full potential. That's all the thanks I need.\\" We shook hands, sealing our new partnership and commitment to Space Z's future. As we walked back to where Jim was, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. Not just for keeping Jim at Space Z, but for potentially steering the company towards a brighter future. Jim was still standing by the beach, looking out at the sea, lost in thought. As we approached, he turned to us, a slight smile forming on his face. \\"Everything okay?\\" he asked, sensing the positive energy between Elon and me. \\"More than okay,\\" Elon replied. \\"Thanks to Sung-guk here, we've come to an agreement. And... we're going to make sure your conditions are met, Jim.\\" Jim's eyes widened in surprise. \\"Really? You mean it?\\" \\"Absolutely,\\" I chimed in. \\"Consider it a new beginning for all of us.\\" Jim looked between Elon and me, his smile growing wider. \\"Thank you, both of you. I...

You have my word,\\" Jim promised, his voice firm and determined. As the sun began to set, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, the three of us stood there, watching in silence. It was a moment of peace and reflection, a brief pause in our busy lives to appreciate the beauty around us and the potential of what lay ahead. Finally, Elon broke the silence. \\"Let's head back. We've got a lot of work to do, but for tonight, let's celebrate this new chapter.\\" We agreed, and as we made our way back to the Space Z office, I couldn't help but feel optimistic about the future. With dedicated people like Jim and Elon, and a little bit of faith and investment, anything was possible. The challenges ahead would be many, but for now, we had a reason to celebrate. Space Z was more than just a company; it was a family. And like any family, we would face our challenges together, supporting each other every step of the way. As the stars began to twinkle in the night sky, I knew that this was just the beginning of a long and exciting journey. Space Z was ready to reach for the stars, and I was proud to be a part of it."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While many professions deal with deadlines and difficult clients, police officers face life-and-death decisions, exposure to human suffering, and the weight of public scrutiny. Understanding these unique stressors is crucial for developing effective strategies for stress management, resilience, and mental health support within the law enforcement community. One of the most significant stressors is the inherent danger of the job. Officers routinely put their lives on the line, never knowing if a routine traffic stop will suddenly turn violent or if responding to a call will put them in the line of fire. This constant vigilance and readiness to confront danger can lead to chronic stress, hypervigilance, and even post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Another stressor is the exposure to human suffering and the worst of human behavior. Police officers are often the first on the scene at accidents, violent crimes, and other tragedies. They witness the aftermath of violence, death, and destruction, absorbing the emotional and psychological impact of these events. Repeated exposure can lead to compassion fatigue, secondary traumatic stress, and burnout, affecting their ability to function both on and off the job. The weight of responsibility and decision-making is a further source of stress. Law enforcement officers are tasked with making split-second decisions that can have life-altering consequences for themselves and others. The fear of making the wrong decision, combined with the potential for legal ramifications and public judgment, adds a layer of anxiety to every action they take. Public scrutiny has intensified in recent years, putting officers under the microscope and subjecting their actions to judgment through the lens of social media and news outlets. This scrutiny, often devoid of the context in which decisions were made, can lead to heightened stress, feelings of isolation, and a sense that the community they serve is against them. The result is an increasing sense of alienation and mistrust between officers and the communities they are sworn to protect. The organizational and bureaucratic aspects of law enforcement work also contribute to stress. Shift work and long hours disrupt sleep patterns, family life, and social activities, leading to fatigue and strain on personal relationships. Additionally, the paramilitary structure of most police forces can result in a lack of autonomy and a sense that one's individual needs and concerns are not acknowledged or valued. Moreover, the internal culture within law enforcement often stigmatizes vulnerability, with officers feeling pressure to maintain a facade of toughness and invulnerability. This can inhibit them from seeking help or discussing their struggles, leading to an accumulation of stress and an increased risk of mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. To effectively address and mitigate these unique stressors, it is essential to foster an environment that supports mental health and well-being within the law enforcement community. Strategies could include providing officers with access to stress management training, mental health resources, and confidential counseling services. Creating a culture that encourages vulnerability and open discussions about mental health challenges can also play a significant role in reducing the stigma and ensuring officers receive the support they need. Additionally, incorporating stress resilience training and emotional intelligence development into police training programs can prepare officers to better manage the psychological demands of their jobs. Encouraging mindfulness practices, physical fitness, and healthy lifestyle choices can further support officers' mental and physical well-being. Understanding the unique stressors of law enforcement is just the first step. It is the responsibility of police departments, policymakers, and the broader community to recognize the immense pressures placed on law enforcement officers and to commit to providing the resources and support necessary to address these challenges. By doing so, we can help protect those who protect us, ensuring they have the resilience, support, and strength to face the demands of their critical and demanding roles."},{"prompt":"500-1000 words write about The premise of the book: Finding strength in stillness","completion":"The premise of \\"Strength in Stillness: Mastery of Stress for Law Enforcement\\" is both revolutionary and ancient, weaving together timeless wisdom with modern psychological insights to equip our modern-day guardians with the tools they need to navigate the tempest of their profession. At its core, the book proposes an audacious yet profoundly simple idea: in the heart of stillness lies untapped strength, a sanctuary for the weary, and a wellspring of resilience for those who protect and serve. This premise challenges the conventional narrative around strength in law enforcement, inviting officers to discover power not in constant motion or relentless action, but in moments of deliberate quietude and introspection. # The Power of Stillness In a profession characterized by noise, chaos, and action, stillness might seem counterintuitive, even alien. \\"Strength in Stillness,\\" however, unfolds the counter-narrative that it is within these moments of quiet that officers can recharge, gain clarity, and foster resilience against the mental and emotional toll of their duties. Stillness, as the book presents, is not mere inactivity or passivity; it is an active engagement with one’s inner self, a conscious choice to pause, breathe, and center amidst the storms. # The Science of Stillness Drawing from psychological research, \\"Strength in Stillness\\" delves into how practices rooted in stillness, such as mindfulness and breathwork, impact the human brain and nervous system. It outlines how these practices reduce stress, enhance decision-making capabilities, and foster emotional resilience. The book offers a compelling argument that integrating stillness into daily routines can recalibrate the stress response system, allowing officers to respond to crises with a clearer mind and steadier heart. # Practical Pathways to Stillness Understanding that law enforcement professionals operate in a highly demanding and unique environment, the book provides practical, actionable strategies tailored to fit into the lives and routines of police officers. From breathing exercises that can be performed even in a patrol car to mindfulness techniques adaptable to any scenario, \\"Strength in Stillness\\" demonstrates that access to stillness and its benefits are always within reach, regardless of external circumstances. # Stillness in Leadership \\"Strength in Stillness\\" also explores the role of stillness in leadership within law enforcement. It posits that leaders who cultivate stillness not only enhance their own resilience but also inspire those around them to adopt similar practices. The book argues for a shift in law enforcement culture towards one that values mental and emotional well-being, where leaders lead by example in practicing stillness, showing that strength comes not just from physical prowess or the ability to control situations, but also from the ability to control one's internal state and reactions. # The Ripple Effects of Stillness The premise of the book further extends to the idea that the benefits of stillness are not confined to the individual officer but have the power to transform the wider law enforcement community and the society they serve. It discusses how officers grounded in stillness contribute to a more compassionate, empathetic, and effective police force, and how these qualities can mend and strengthen the often-tenuous relationship between law enforcement and the community. # Addressing Critiques Anticipating skepticism, \\"Strength in Stillness\\" addresses common criticisms head-on, providing evidence and testimony from officers who have integrated these practices into their lives. It acknowledges the challenges and barriers to embracing stillness in a culture that equates constant action with productivity and strength, offering insights into how these barriers can be overcome. # The Ultimate Strength \\"Strength in Stillness\\" redefines strength in the context of law enforcement, suggesting that true strength lies in the ability to remain calm in the face of chaos, to make decisions from a place of clarity rather than reactivity, and to maintain one’s humanity in the midst of inhumanity. It invites officers to view stillness not as a luxury or an afterthought but as an essential tool in their arsenal, a source of strength that can sustain them through the darkest of times. In its essence, \\"Strength in Stillness: Mastery of Stress for Law Enforcement\\" is a manifesto for change, a call to arms for officers to arm themselves not only with weapons of defense but with tools of resilience. It champions the radical notion that in stillness, officers can find the strength they need to face their demanding profession with courage, compassion, and unwavering resilience."},{"prompt":"in 500-1000 words write Personal stories: Why this matters","completion":"In the heart of the book \\"Strength in Stillness: Mastery of Stress for Law Enforcement,\\" lie the personal stories that illuminate why embracing stillness is not just beneficial but essential for those in law enforcement. These narratives, drawn from real officers who have faced the tempests of their profession, underscore the transformative power of finding strength in stillness. Each story serves as a testament to the human spirit's resilience, showcasing the profound impact of integrating mindfulness and inner tranquility into the rigorous demands of police work. # Officer A: The Weight of the Badge Officer A had served in law enforcement for over a decade, embodying the image of strength and invulnerability that many associate with the profession. Yet beneath the surface, the cumulative stress of countless emergencies, confrontations, and life-threatening situations began to take a toll. Insomnia, irritability, and a growing sense of detachment from family life became his norm. It was during a routine wellness seminar introduced by his department, focused on mindfulness and breathwork, that Officer A skeptically embarked on a journey towards stillness. Over time, he noted a marked improvement in his sleep, a decrease in his previously high levels of stress, and a renewed ability to connect with loved ones. Officer A's story is not just about personal transformation; it's a narrative about rediscovering the capacity for joy and connection, underscoring the vital nature of stillness in sustaining one's emotional and mental wellbeing. # Officer B: The Echoes of Trauma Another compelling story comes from Officer B, who encountered a traumatic event that shook her to her core. Involved in a shooting that resulted in a fatality, she was haunted by persistent flashbacks and a debilitating sense of guilt, even though she had acted in defense of her life and that of her partner's. Traditional approaches to managing post-traumatic stress seemed to fall short for her. It wasn't until she was introduced to guided meditation and breath-focused exercises, tools for cultivating stillness, that she began to notice a shift. These practices became her refuge, helping her process her trauma, manage her stress reactions, and gradually find a path towards healing. Officer B’s experience underscores the critical role stillness can play in addressing and healing from the invisible wounds of service. # Officer C: Leading by Example The story of Officer C reflects the power of stillness not just for individual officers but for leadership and team cohesion. As a senior officer and team leader, he noticed the toll that the high-stress environment was taking on his unit: increased sick days, tensions among team members, and a general decline in morale. Inspired by his personal practices of morning meditation and mindfulness, he decided to incorporate moments of stillness into the team's routine – starting meetings with a minute of silence and encouraging mindful breathing during stressful calls. Over time, the team reported feeling more connected, more composed in the face of challenges, and more supportive of one another. Officer C's story highlights the ripple effect that the practice of stillness can have, fostering not only individual resilience but also enhancing teamwork and camaraderie. # The Larger Narrative These personal stories, woven throughout \\"Strength in Stillness,\\" bring to life the book's central thesis: that amidst the chaos and demands of law enforcement, finding strength in stillness is not only possible but profoundly transformative. They serve as vivid reminders that behind the badge, officers are human beings subject to the same stressors, fears, and vulnerabilities as anyone else – and that they too can benefit from practices that anchor them in the eye of the storm. Moreover, these narratives underscore a crucial message: the importance of mental health resources, support systems, and cultural shifts within law enforcement agencies to embrace and promote practices that foster mental and emotional well-being. They call for a reevaluation of what it means to be strong in a profession marked by constant exposure to stress and trauma, advocating for a definition of strength that includes vulnerability, self-care, and the courage to seek stillness. Ultimately, \\"Strength in Stillness\\" is more than a guide; it's an invitation to law enforcement professionals to embark on a journey towards resilience, well-being, and renewed purpose. Through the personal stories of those who have walked this path, the book illuminates why this journey matters – for the health of the officers, the health of their families, and the health of the communities they serve."},{"prompt":"500-100 words write Types of stress encountered by police officers","completion":"Police officers are exposed to a broad and complex range of stressors that are not only diverse but also carry profound implications for their physical and psychological health. These stressors go beyond what professionals in many other fields experience, given the demanding nature of law enforcement duties. 1. **Critical Incident Stress**: This includes involvement in or exposure to events like shootings, high-speed pursuits, violent assaults, and the aftermath of mass casualty incidents. Such experiences can lead to acute stress reactions and, over time, potentially to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 2. **Cumulative Stress**: The day-to-day aspects of police work, including dealing with difficult individuals, managing domestic disputes, and constantly facing human suffering, contribute to a type of stress that accumulates over time. This chronic exposure can erode an officer's psychological resilience, leading to burnout. 3. **Organizational Stress**: Stemming from within the police department itself, these stressors include excessive paperwork, shift work, long hours, perceived lack of support from the administration, and the pressure of maintaining a certain performance standard. 4. **Legal and Administrative Stress**: Officers often face anxiety over potential legal challenges stemming from their actions in the line of duty, disciplinary actions, or internal investigations, which can create an environment of constant vigilance and fear of making mistakes. 5. **Personal Stress**: Like any individual, police officers encounter personal stressors, such as family issues, financial problems, or health concerns. However, the demanding nature of police work, including irregular hours and the emotional toll of the job, can exacerbate these personal pressures. 6. **Societal Stress**: With increasing scrutiny on law enforcement actions, officers often face critical public perception and media coverage. This societal pressure, especially in an era of social media, can lead to a sense of being constantly under a microscope, contributing to stress. 7. **Peer Stress**: The law enforcement community is tightly knit, and officers often feel pressure to conform to the norms and expectations of their peers, including attitudes towards toughness and reluctance to show vulnerability or seek help for stress-related issues. The multiplicity and intensity of these stressors necessitate comprehensive, multifaceted approaches to support officers' mental and physical health, reinforcing the importance of interventions like those presented in \\"Strength in Stillness: Mastery of Stress for Law Enforcement.\\""},{"prompt":"Using 500-1000 words, write about the Types of stress encountered by police officers","completion":"Police officers operate in one of the most high-pressure environments imaginable, where the line between life and death can blur in a matter of seconds. This demanding professional landscape exposes officers to an array of stressors that can profoundly affect their mental, emotional, and physical well-being. The types of stress encountered by police officers are multidimensional, spanning from the immediate and visceral reactions to critical incidents, through to the slow burn of organizational and societal pressures. Understanding these stressors offers insight into the challenging realities of law enforcement work and underscores the necessity of tailored support systems. # Critical Incident Stress Critical incidents, including violent confrontations, shootings, high-speed pursuits, and the handling of severe accidents or crimes, represent acute stressors. These events can induce intense, immediate stress reactions as officers have to make split-second decisions under conditions of extreme uncertainty and danger. The aftermath of such incidents often lingers, potentially giving rise to long-term psychological conditions such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), especially if officers do not receive adequate debriefing and support. # Cumulative Stress Beyond the immediacy of critical incidents lies the cumulative stress wrought by the day-to-day realities of police work. Regular exposure to human tragedy, managing conflicted situations, and even the routine monotony of paperwork can accumulate, eroding an officer's mental resilience. This form of stress is insidious, as the gradual accumulation can make it harder for officers to recognize the toll it's taking until they are significantly impacted. # Organizational Stress Organizational stress derives from the structure, culture, and bureaucracy of the police force itself. This can include dissatisfaction with management, perceived lack of support, internal politics, and frustrations with the limitations imposed by protocols and procedures. Additionally, the irregular hours, shift work, and requirement to remain on call can disrupt personal lives, leading to a blurring of boundaries between work and home life, exacerbating stress levels. # Legal and Administrative Stress In an era of heightened scrutiny of police action, officers constantly navigate the potential legal repercussions of their decisions. The fear of litigation, coupled with internal departmental investigations and disciplinary proceedings, can foster an environment of anxiety and second-guessing, complicating the already difficult decisions officers must make in the field. This stressor highlights the complex interplay between fulfilling professional duties and navigating the legal frameworks governing law enforcement activities. # Societal Stress The relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve has grown increasingly complex, characterized by a mix of mutual dependency, tension, and, in some cases, outright conflict. Officers must balance their role in maintaining public safety with often critical public perceptions and media portrayals of their actions. Social media has amplified this scrutiny, making officers sensitive to the widespread, often instantaneous judgment of their conduct. Navigating this landscape requires a robust mental fortitude, as societal stress can significantly impact officers' sense of efficacy and vocational satisfaction. # Personal Stress Like any individual, police officers face personal life stressors, ranging from financial worries and relationship issues to health concerns. The demands of police work, with its irregular hours and emotional toll, can compound these personal stresses, making them more difficult to manage. Furthermore, the culture within law enforcement, which traditionally prioritizes toughness and resilience, can make it challenging for officers to seek support, creating a situation where personal and professional stresses feed into one another. # Peer Stress Finally, the culture among police officers, characterized by camaraderie and a shared understanding of their unique work environment, also carries its own set of stressors. Officers may feel pressure to conform to group norms around bravery, stoicism, and the handling of stress. Admitting to feeling overwhelmed or seeking help can be seen as a sign of weakness, leading many to internalize their struggles rather than seeking the support they need. # Conclusion The spectrum of stress encountered by police officers highlights the complex interplay of factors that characterize the challenging environment of law enforcement. The physical dangers inherent in their role, combined with organizational, legal, societal, and personal pressures, create a multifaceted web of stress. Recognizing these stressors is the first step towards developing comprehensive support and intervention strategies, such as those advocated for in \\"Strength in Stillness: Mastery of Stress for Law Enforcement.\\" By acknowledging the unique pressures faced by police officers and providing them with tools to manage stress, we can not only enhance their well-being but also improve their effectiveness and the overall health of the communities they serve."},{"prompt":"in 500-1000 words write about Physical, emotional, and psychological impacts","completion":"The repercussions of stress, especially within high-stress professions like law enforcement, span across physical, emotional, and psychological domains, weaving a complex web of impact that can substantially impair an individual's functioning and quality of life. Police officers, by the nature of their work, are particularly susceptible to an array of consequences stemming from their routine exposure to critical incidents, organizational pressures, and societal expectations. This discussion delves into the multifaceted impacts stress has on individuals in such high-stakes careers. # Physical Impacts The physical manifestations of stress are perhaps the most immediately recognizable and encompass a gamut of symptoms and conditions that can deteriorate an officer's health. Chronic stress triggers the body's stress response system, notably the \\"fight or flight\\" response, which primes the body for immediate action. While beneficial in short bursts, prolonged activation of this system can lead to detrimental health outcomes. Hypertension (high blood pressure) and cardiovascular diseases are prevalent among officers, stemming directly from sustained stress and its physiological bearings. The stress response also suppresses the immune system, rendering the body more susceptible to infections and illnesses. Additionally, digestive problems, headaches, and chronic muscle tension are common physical complaints linked to the effects of stress. Sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling or staying asleep, are widespread. The erratic shifts and the need to remain vigilant heighten the risk of developing insomnia and other sleep disorders. Over time, inadequate sleep not only exacerbates the physical health issues but also impairs cognitive functioning and emotional regulation, creating a vicious cycle of escalating stress and deteriorating health. # Emotional Impacts Emotional repercussions of stress often manifest through altered mood states, heightened emotional responses, and changes in behavior. Police officers may experience increased irritability, frustration, and anger, making interpersonal interactions, both within the professional realm and at home, strained. Feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or a pervasive cynicism towards their job and the communities they serve can develop, feeding into a disconnection from the work once found meaningful. Heightened anxiety levels, frequent mood swings, and decreased job satisfaction are common, potentially culminating in more severe conditions such as depression. The emotional toll can be compounded by the stigma within law enforcement culture against acknowledging emotional struggles, leaving many to suffer in silence without seeking necessary support. # Psychological Impacts Psychological impacts are deeply intertwined with both the physical and emotional repercussions of stress, underscoring the holistic nature of well-being. Chronic stress, particularly of the type encountered by the police force, significantly affects cognitive functions. Concentration, decision-making abilities, and memory can be impaired, potentially impacting job performance and safety. Critical incident stress, if unaddressed, can lead to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), characterized by flashbacks, avoidance behaviors, and hyperarousal, severely affecting an officer's ability to function. Moreover, the cumulative nature of stress from routine police work can manifest as compassion fatigue and burnout – conditions marked by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a diminished sense of personal accomplishment. The psychological strain also increases the risk of substance abuse as a maladaptive coping mechanism. Alcohol and prescription drugs may be used to dull the emotional and psychological discomfort, leading to dependence and further compounding the stress cycle. # The Ripple Effect The physical, emotional, and psychological impacts of stress do not occur in isolation but influence one another in a continuous feedback loop. For example, chronic pain or illness (physical) can contribute to feelings of frustration or sadness (emotional), which in turn can cloud judgment or impair memory (psychological). This interconnectedness underscores the necessity of addressing stress in a holistic manner, acknowledging its wide-reaching implications. Moreover, the effects of stress extend beyond the individual officer, impacting family dynamics, workplace relationships, and the broader community. Interpersonal relationships may suffer due to emotional volatility or withdrawal behaviors, while at work, decreased performance and increased absenteeism can affect team morale and effectiveness. On a community level, stressed officers are more likely to have negative interactions with the public, potentially escalating situations and eroding trust. # Conclusion The constellation of physical, emotional, and psychological impacts of stress on police officers paints a vivid picture of the toll exacted by the profession's demands. These impacts underscore the critical need for proactive stress management interventions, comprehensive support systems, and a cultural shift within law enforcement agencies towards prioritizing mental health and well-being. Importantly, addressing these needs not only benefits the officers themselves but also enhances their capacity to fulfill their roles effectively, fostering healthier communities rooted in mutual respect and understanding."},{"prompt":"500-1000 words write about The stigma around discussing stress and mental health","completion":"The stigma surrounding the discussion of stress and mental health is a pervasive issue that extends across many sectors of society, yet it is profoundly pronounced in professions traditionally viewed through a lens of stoicism and resilience, such as law enforcement and military service. In these fields, the prevailing cultural ethos often equates mental toughness with silence in the face of personal suffering, inadvertently fostering an environment where admitting to struggles with stress or mental health issues is seen as a sign of weakness. This stigma not only impedes individuals from seeking the help they need but also exacerbates the very issues it seeks to conceal, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of silence and suffering. # Historical and Cultural Foundations The roots of this stigma are deeply embedded in historical and cultural narratives that valorize the stoic, unflappable hero who faces adversity without flinching. These narratives, while inspiring, set unrealistic standards for human resilience, failing to account for the natural psychological repercussions of exposure to stress, trauma, and adversity. In professions like law enforcement, where officers regularly confront life-and-death situations, the pressures of living up to these ideals can lead to a culture of denial and repression regarding mental health challenges. # The Role of Professional Identity For many in law enforcement, their professional identity is tightly bound to ideals of strength, control, and invulnerability. Admitting to struggles with mental health or stress can feel tantamount to questioning their competence and suitability for the role. This fear of professional repercussions — including the possibility of being deemed unfit for duty or facing judgment from peers — acts as a powerful deterrent against seeking help. The result is a workforce at increased risk for untreated mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, and PTSD, which can have serious implications for their efficacy, decision-making, and overall well-being. # Impact on Help-Seeking Behavior The stigma surrounding mental health discussions significantly impacts help-seeking behavior. Individuals may avoid using available mental health resources, delay seeking help, or even deny they have a problem, out of fear of stigmatization. This reluctance to seek assistance not only prolongs suffering but also increases the risk of mental health issues progressing to more severe states. In the context of law enforcement, where the well-being of officers directly influences their interactions with the public, the stakes of such reluctance are particularly high. # The Toll of Silence The silence enforced by stigma takes its toll not only on individual officers but also on the broader law enforcement community and the society they serve. Untreated mental health issues can lead to increased absenteeism, decreased job performance, and higher incidence rates of substance abuse and suicide. Furthermore, the stress and mental health challenges that officers face can become manifest in their interactions with the community, potentially leading to escalated confrontations and eroded public trust. # Initiatives to Break the Stigma Recognizing the destructive potential of mental health stigma, there have been growing efforts within law enforcement agencies and the broader community to break the cycle of silence. These initiatives focus on education, fostering open dialogue, and providing confidential, stigma-free access to mental health resources. Peer support programs, wherein officers can share their experiences and challenges with colleagues who understand the unique pressures of the profession, have shown promise in creating safe spaces for discussion. Moreover, leadership within law enforcement agencies plays a crucial role in shifting the cultural perception of mental health. When leaders openly prioritize mental well-being, model healthy coping strategies, and share their own experiences with stress and mental health, it sends a powerful message that seeking help is not only acceptable but encouraged. # Shifting the Narrative To effectively combat the stigma around discussing stress and mental health, there needs to be a cultural and narrative shift that redefines strength not as silence in the face of adversity but as the courage to acknowledge vulnerability and seek support. This redefinition involves educating officers and the public about the realities of mental health, normalizing mental health struggles as part of the human condition, and highlighting the strength it takes to confront personal challenges head-on. # Conclusion The stigma around discussing stress and mental health in law enforcement is a barrier to well-being and effectiveness, both for individual officers and the communities they serve. Breaking this stigma requires a concerted effort to change cultural narratives, foster open dialogues, and provide accessible, confidential support. By doing so, we can create a healthier, more resilient law enforcement community capable of serving with empathy, compassion, and strength."},{"prompt":"500-1000 words on Historical and Cultural Foundations","completion":"The historical and cultural foundations that shape our understanding of stress and mental health, particularly in the context of professions that prioritize stoicism and resilience, are deeply entrenched in societal narratives that date back centuries. These foundations influence not only how individuals perceive and respond to their own mental health struggles but also how societies organize support systems and respond to those in need. By examining these historical and cultural underpinnings, we can better understand the roots of the stigma surrounding mental health discussions, especially within high-pressure professions such as law enforcement and military service. # Ancient Philosophies and Valor The valorization of stoicism—both as a philosophical tradition originating in ancient Greece and as a broader cultural ideal—has had a significant impact on attitudes toward mental health. Stoicism, which emphasizes control over one’s emotions and endurance in the face of suffering, has been historically admired and associated with strength and leadership. In Roman culture, the stoic warrior became an archetype, embodying ideals of bravery, self-control, and resilience against physical and emotional adversity. These values have subsequently permeated many aspects of Western culture, influencing perceptions of ideal responses to stress and trauma. # The Influence of Industrialization The Industrial Revolution brought about a seismic shift in societal organization, work, and family life. The machinations of industry valued efficiency, productivity, and endurance, often at the expense of individual workers' physical and mental well-being. The ideal worker was seen as a cog in a machine, reliable and uncomplaining, setting the stage for modern attitudes toward work and mental health where personal struggles are often sidelined in the pursuit of productivity. This historical moment underscored a cultural narrative that equates personal worth with work output, further marginalizing discussions of mental health and well-being. # Military Traditions and Heroism Military traditions have also played a significant role in shaping attitudes toward mental health. The concept of the heroic, unyielding soldier, capable of facing unimaginable horrors without flinching, has been romanticized in literature, history, and media. This portrayal, while celebrating the unquestionable bravery of service members, inadvertently casts psychological struggles as failures or weaknesses. The repercussions of such portrayals are profound, contributing to a pervasive reluctance among military personnel—and by extension, other high-stakes professions such as policing—to acknowledge and seek help for mental health issues. # Medicalization of Mental Health The medicalization of mental health in the 19th and 20th centuries marked a significant shift in understanding and addressing mental illness. As medical science began to explore the mind, conditions such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD were increasingly recognized as medical issues. However, this medicalization also contributed to stigma, as diagnoses could be seen as labels signifying brokenness or defectiveness. While the intention was to advance treatment, the effect, in many cases, was to reinforce a dichotomy between those considered \\"normal\\" and those labeled as mentally ill, further complicating the cultural discourse around mental health. # Change Through Awareness and Advocacy In recent decades, awareness campaigns and advocacy movements have begun to challenge historical and cultural stigmas associated with mental health. Grassroots movements, influenced by broader social and cultural shifts towards inclusivity and understanding, have sought to reframe mental health struggles as common aspects of the human experience rather than as signs of weakness or failure. These efforts have gradually started to erode the deep-seated prejudices and misconceptions about mental health, pioneering a more compassionate, informed approach to mental well-being. # The Path Forward The historical and cultural foundations of our current attitudes toward mental health and stress reveal a complex tapestry of influences that have shaped how we understand and respond to mental illness. While the stoic, uncomplaining warrior or worker may still be valorized in certain quarters, there is a growing recognition of the need for a more nuanced understanding of strength—one that includes the courage to confront and discuss mental health challenges. Breaking the cycle of stigma and silence requires a continued effort to educate, advocate, and change cultural narratives around mental health. By acknowledging and addressing the historical and cultural roots of these attitudes, we can pave the way for a future where discussing and seeking help for mental health issues is not only accepted but encouraged, fostering healthier, more resilient communities for all."},{"prompt":"elaborate increasing to 500 words; The valorization of stoicism—both as a philosophical tradition originating in ancient Greece and as a broader cultural ideal—has had a significant impact on attitudes toward mental health.

Stoicism, as a philosophy, champions the virtues of emotional regulation, equanimity in the face of adversities, and the pursuit of virtue above all. The stoic philosopher is unmoved by fortune, good or bad, and finds strength in an internal moral compass rather than external circumstances. This philosophical foundation laid the groundwork for the stoic warrior ideal in Roman culture—a figure of unwavering bravery, masterful control over emotions, and indomitable resilience in both physical and emotional arenas. The archetype of the stoic warrior, celebrated in Roman society, epitomized the highest virtues of human capability and leadership. This figure was not merely a warrior in the literal sense but a symbol of enduring strength and leadership under duress. The stoic warrior managed fear and pain without outwardly displaying distress, embodying a level of self-control and emotional restraint that was aspired to by many. In this context, vulnerability or the admission of psychological suffering was often viewed as antithetical to the ideals of strength and resilience. As Roman culture influenced much of Western civilization, the ideals of stoicism were woven into the fabric of Western attitudes towards mental health. Stoicism's emphasis on emotional control and endurance against suffering was translated into a broader cultural ideal that valorizes silence over the expression of pain and equates mental resilience with the suppression of emotional distress. This cultural backdrop creates a challenging environment for addressing mental health issues openly, as the stoic ideal can stigmatize those who express vulnerability or seek help for psychological struggles. In modern contexts, particularly in professions that demand high levels of physical and emotional endurance such as military and law enforcement, the stoic ideal continues to exert a powerful influence. The valorization of the stoic ethos in these professions promulgates a culture where individuals are often reluctant to acknowledge mental health difficulties, fearing it may be perceived as a weakness or failure to uphold the stoic virtues of resilience and emotional control. This dynamic can lead to underreporting of stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues, with individuals struggling in silence rather than seeking the support and resources that could aid their healing and well-being. The legacy of stoicism, with its focus on endurance and control, thus poses a double-edged sword in the realm of mental health. While fostering resilience and a degree of equanimity in the face of life’s challenges can be valuable, an overly rigid adherence to stoic ideals may hinder the healthy expression of emotions and vulnerability, vital components of psychological well-being. As society continues to grapple with the complexities of mental health, there is a growing recognition of the need to reevaluate and expand upon these ancient ideals, encouraging a more balanced approach that acknowledges the strength in vulnerability and the importance of emotional expression as part of a holistic understanding of human resilience."},{"prompt":"Elaborate using 500-1000 words; For many in law enforcement, their professional identity is tightly bound to ideals of strength, control, and invulnerability.

Officers are often molded by a culture that equates emotional stoicism with professional competence. An unwritten creed pervades the profession, suggesting that a true officer must remain unflappable, undeterred, and unaffected by the harrowing aspects of their job. This ideal, deeply ingrained in the identity of law enforcement personnel, significantly influences their approach to mental health and stress. The intrinsic link between professional identity and these ideals complicates the acknowledgment of mental health struggles within law enforcement circles. For many officers, the very act of admitting that they are grappling with stress, anxiety, depression, or PTSD feels like a betrayal of their professional ethos. More than just a personal admission, it is perceived as a public declaration of one's inability to uphold the tenets of their role. The fear of professional repercussions looms large, casting a long shadow over decisions to seek help. Officers may worry about being deemed unfit for duty, facing demotion, or being sidelined to desk work, which in the context of law enforcement culture can feel like a demotion or a badge of dishonor. Moreover, the potential for judgment from peers exacerbates the situation. The camaraderie and brotherhood within law enforcement, while a source of strength and support in many instances, can also serve as a barrier to openly discussing mental health issues. There exists an underlying concern about changing dynamics within the team, fear of losing respect, or becoming the subject of behind-the-back whisper campaigns about one’s fitness and mental toughness. This creates an environment where many officers choose to suffer in silence rather than risk ostracization or damaging their carefully cultivated professional reputation. The consequences of this culture of silence are far-reaching. Mental health issues, left unaddressed, can significantly impair an officer's job performance, affecting critical decision-making abilities, reducing overall efficacy, and increasing the likelihood of errors in judgment — all of which can have dire consequences in high-stakes law enforcement situations. Beyond the professional implications, there are profound personal costs. Untreated mental health conditions can lead to deteriorating physical health, strained relationships with family and friends, and in the most tragic cases, substance abuse or suicide. Despite these stark realities, the move towards changing this entrenched culture has been slow. However, there are glimmers of progress. Initiatives aimed at destigmatizing mental health in law enforcement are gaining traction. Programs that emphasize the importance of mental wellness, resilience training, stress management techniques, and providing access to mental health resources are being increasingly implemented across various departments. Peer support programs, where officers can discuss their experiences and challenges with colleagues who have faced similar issues, offer a promising avenue for breaking the silence around mental health. Leadership within law enforcement agencies plays a pivotal role in this cultural shift. When leaders openly prioritize mental health, share their own experiences, and advocate for mental wellness, it sends a powerful message: seeking help is a sign of responsibility to oneself and the badge, not a weakness. Breaking the cycle of silence and stigma requires a multi-faceted approach. It involves not only providing resources and support but also fundamentally reevaluating and shifting the cultural narratives around strength and vulnerability in law enforcement. By fostering an environment where mental health is regarded as integral to professional competence as physical fitness and tactical acumen, the law enforcement community can begin to address the mental health crisis within its ranks. Acknowledging that vulnerability is not antithetical to strength but a component of a well-rounded, resilient officer is key. Ultimately, the goal is to cultivate a culture where officers feel empowered to seek help, knowing it will not only enhance their personal well-being but also their effectiveness in serving and protecting their communities."},{"prompt":"Elaborate using 500-1000 words; The stigma surrounding mental health discussions significantly impacts help-seeking behavior.

This stigma, deeply entrenched in societal attitudes and exacerbated by the unique cultural norms of police work, significantly influences officers' willingness to acknowledge mental health struggles and pursue treatment. The consequences of this reluctance are profound, affecting not only the individual officers but also the broader framework within which they operate, including their interactions with the community and overall public safety. # The Nature of Stigma in Law Enforcement In many societies, mental health conditions are stigmatized due to misunderstanding, fear, and historical prejudices. This stigma is magnified within law enforcement, where traditional ideals of strength and resilience are paramount. Officers are often conditioned to view the admission of psychological distress as a failure, a deviation from the stoic archetype of the police officer who faces danger unflinchingly. This cultural backdrop creates an environment where officers may choose to suffer in silence rather than face the perceived shame associated with mental health issues. # Impacts on Help-Seeking Behavior The fear of stigmatization leads to various adverse outcomes in help-seeking behavior among law enforcement officers. Firstly, many officers are reluctant to utilize available mental health resources, despite their effectiveness. Programs designed to provide psychological support are often underutilized because officers fear that accessing these services will be seen as a sign of weakness or will somehow be noted on their professional record, potentially jeopardizing their career advancement or standing within the department. Secondly, the stigma contributes to delays in seeking help. Officers might wait until they are in a state of crisis before acknowledging they need assistance, at which point their issues may have exacerbated to more severe and complex conditions. Early intervention is crucial in the effective management of mental health conditions, meaning that such delays can significantly impair the prospects of recovery and effective management of the condition. Furthermore, denial plays a significant role. The internalization of stigma can lead officers to deny they are experiencing any problems at all, attributing symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression to mere occupational hazards or temporary issues that will resolve independently. This denial not only prevents individuals from seeking help but can also hinder their recognition of the impact their mental health is having on their work and personal life. # Broader Implications The reluctance to seek mental health assistance has far-reaching implications beyond the individual officers. In law enforcement, an officer's state of mind directly influences their decision-making, reaction times, and how they interact with members of the public. Mental health issues, particularly if unaddressed, can impair judgment, increase the likelihood of overreaction, and potentially lead to situations where the use of force is misapplied. Moreover, untreated mental health conditions contribute to higher rates of burnout, absenteeism, and turnover within the police force, which not only strains resources but can also diminish the quality of policing. Additionally, there is a significant impact on officers' personal lives, including increased risks of substance abuse, marital stress, and even suicide. These personal and professional consequences underscore the critical need for cultural and systemic changes within law enforcement agencies to address and destigmatize mental health issues. # Moving Forward To mitigate these impacts, systematic efforts are needed to change the culture within law enforcement and broader society regarding mental health. This includes increasing education and awareness about mental health issues, promoting resilience-building and stress management practices as part of routine training, and ensuring confidential and easily accessible psychological support services. Leadership within law enforcement agencies plays a pivotal role in this transformation, as leaders set the tone for what is acceptable and encouraged within the force. By openly discussing mental health, advocating for support services, and demonstrating a commitment to officer well-being, leaders can begin to dismantle the stigma and foster an environment where seeking help is viewed as a strength, not a weakness. Ultimately, addressing the stigma surrounding mental health discussions in law enforcement requires a multifaceted approach that includes policy changes, cultural shifts, and ongoing education. By doing so, law enforcement agencies can create a supportive environment that encourages officers to seek help when needed, thereby enhancing not only their well-being but also their effectiveness in serving and protecting the community."},{"prompt":"paraphrase to sound polite; Yes, but signing up for therapy is a process that may take a couple weeks.

This silence—marinated in cultural, institutional, and societal pressures—encourages a landscape where untreated mental health issues flourish, with far-reaching implications that ripple through the veins of police departments and the societal body they are sworn to protect. The stigma against discussing mental health challenges in law enforcement acts as an invisible barrier to seeking help. This reluctance to address and treat mental health issues manifests in various detrimental ways. Firstly, there is a notable increase in absenteeism. Officers struggling with untreated mental health issues may find it increasingly difficult to perform their duties, leading to more frequent absences from work. These absences not only place additional strain on their colleagues but also reduce the capacity of law enforcement agencies to serve their communities effectively. Moreover, job performance among officers grappling with mental health challenges can significantly decline. The demands of police work require acute mental clarity, emotional stability, and the capacity to make swift, judicious decisions under pressure. Untreated mental health conditions can impair cognitive functions, emotional regulation, and reaction times, thereby hampering the workforce's overall efficiency and effectiveness. The direct link between an officer's psychological well-being and their operational performance underscores the critical need for mental health awareness and support within the profession. The consequences of unaddressed mental health issues in law enforcement extend beyond absenteeism and diminished job performance. Higher incidence rates of substance abuse and suicide within police ranks speak to the profound personal and professional despair many officers face. Substance abuse often emerges as a maladaptive coping mechanism for managing stress, anxiety, depression, or PTSD, trapping officers in a cycle that can lead to addiction, further exacerbating their mental health struggles and impacting their work and personal life. Suicide, representing the most tragic outcome of untreated mental health conditions, leaves indelible scars on families, colleagues, and the law enforcement community, highlighting the urgent need for a culture shift towards openness and preventive mental health care. The ramifications of the stigma-induced silence around mental health reach into the very fabric of the communities law enforcement officers serve. Stress and mental health challenges, when not properly managed, can influence officers' interactions with the public. Research and anecdotal evidence suggest that officers under significant mental and emotional strain are more likely to engage in confrontations that escalate unnecessarily. Such incidents can erode public trust and confidence in law enforcement, igniting cycles of tension and mutual mistrust between police and community members. This erosion of trust undermines the foundational principle of policing by consent, on which democratic societies rely for maintaining public order and safety. Furthermore, in today's digitally connected world, negative encounters between law enforcement officers and community members can quickly gain widespread attention, amplifying perceptions of police misconduct and further deteriorating public trust at a national scale. This dynamic underscores the imperative for law enforcement agencies to proactively address mental health within their ranks, not only as a matter of personal well-being but as a strategic imperative for maintaining public confidence and effective community policing. Addressing the silence enforced by stigma requires a multipronged approach that involves policy reform, training, and cultural change within law enforcement agencies. Creating an environment where officers feel safe and supported in seeking help for mental health issues is paramount. This shift necessitates leadership commitment, peer support programs, confidential and accessible mental health services, and ongoing education to dismantle myths surrounding mental health. Moreover, fostering partnerships with mental health professionals, community leaders, and advocacy groups can bolster efforts to destigmatize mental health in law enforcement, paving the way for more compassionate, effective policing practices that benefit both officers and the communities they serve. In essence, breaking the silence on mental health in law enforcement is paramount to ensuring the wellness of officers, the integrity of policing practices, and the health of society.

Educational programs tailored for law enforcement agencies aim to demystify mental health issues, debunk common myths, and highlight the prevalence of mental health challenges within the profession. By incorporating mental health awareness into training programs, recruits and seasoned officers alike are equipped with a better understanding of both their own mental health and that of their colleagues. This education extends to recognizing signs of stress, depression, anxiety, and PTSD, not as failures of character but as occupational hazards that can be managed and treated. Dialogue – open, honest, and destigmatized conversations about mental health – further nurtures an environment where officers feel safe to speak about their experiences. Town hall meetings, workshops, and facilitated group discussions provide platforms for these important conversations, breaking down the barriers of isolation and silence that often accompany mental health struggles. # The Role of Peer Support Programs Peer support programs stand as a beacon of progress in the efforts to combat mental health stigma within law enforcement. These initiatives connect officers with their colleagues who have experienced similar challenges and have either navigated through them or are still in the process of doing so. The power of shared experience cannot be underestimated; it fosters a sense of understanding, empathy, and solidarity that can often elude external support mechanisms. These peer-driven networks create safe spaces where officers can share their stories, challenges, and coping strategies without fear of judgment or reprisal, knowing their confidantes understand the unique pressures of the job. By normalizing these conversations, peer support programs play a significant role in dismantling the stigma, offering a lifeline to those who might otherwise suffer in silence. # Leadership’s Crucial Influence Leadership in law enforcement agencies is the linchpin in shifting the cultural perception of mental health within the profession. Leaders who prioritize mental well-being, from the top brass to frontline supervisors, set a precedent that permeates the entire organization. When leaders model healthy coping strategies, openly discuss their own experiences with stress and mental health challenges, and actively support their officers in seeking help, it cultivates an organizational culture where mental health is valued as much as physical health and operational competence. Leadership commitment to mental health also involves policy-making that protects and promotes the well-being of officers. Implementing policies that ensure confidential access to mental health services, integrating mental health considerations into operational planning, and providing time and resources for mental health care signal an organizational commitment to officer wellness. Furthermore, leaders can advocate for systemic changes that address the root causes of mental health stigma, including reevaluating performance evaluation processes that may inadvertently penalize officers for seeking help. # The Path Forward As efforts to break the cycle of silence and stigma surrounding mental health in law enforcement continue to evolve, the path forward requires a sustained and collaborative effort. Education and dialogue must be ongoing, adapting to the changing landscape of law enforcement work and the emerging needs of its members. Peer support programs should be expanded and integrated into the fabric of law enforcement agencies, ensuring that every officer has access to this critical resource. Leadership at all levels must remain committed to the cause, demonstrating through policy and practice that the well-being of officers is a paramount concern. Ultimately, by fostering an environment where mental health is openly discussed, supported, and integrated into the very ethos of law enforcement, the profession can begin to heal from within. This transformation not only benefits the officers themselves but also enhances the quality, compassion, and efficacy of the services they provide to the communities they pledge to serve and protect. The journey towards breaking the cycle of mental health stigma is challenging, but it is a necessary endeavor for the health of law enforcement personnel and the society they dedicate themselves to protect."},{"prompt":"elaborate on this using 500-1000 words; To effectively combat the stigma around discussing stress and mental health, there needs to be a cultural and narrative shift that redefines strength not as silence in the face of adversity but as the courage to acknowledge vulnerability and seek support. This redefinition involves educating officers and the public about the realities of mental health, normalizing mental health struggles as part of the human condition, and highlighting the strength it takes to confront personal challenges head-on.","completion":"In the high-stress, high-stakes realm of law enforcement, officers are routinely exposed to situations that can have profound effects on their mental health. Yet, the pervasive culture within this community often valorizes stoicism in the face of adversity, misinterpreting silence as strength and marking the discussion of mental health issues as a vulnerability. To dismantle the stigma surrounding the discussion of stress and mental health within the law enforcement community, a seismic cultural and narrative shift is imperative. This shift requires redefining what it truly means to be strong, not as an ability to suppress emotions or endure in silence, but as the courage to acknowledge one's own vulnerabilities and seek the necessary support. # Redefining Strength The redefinition of strength begins with an acknowledgment that even the most resilient individuals have limits, and facing this fact is not a weakness but a demonstration of true bravery. It’s about understanding that the human psyche, like the body, can suffer injuries that require treatment and healing time. Law enforcement agencies can foster this narrative shift by integrating this philosophy into their training programs, encouraging open discussions about mental health and fostering an environment where seeking help is viewed as a proactive and commendable step. # The Role of Education Education is a cornerstone of this cultural shift. Both law enforcement personnel and the public require comprehensive education about the realities of mental health to dispel myths and misconceptions. For officers, this education can be integrated into their training, highlighting the importance of mental wellness, the signs of mental health struggles, and the available resources for support. Public education campaigns can enhance understanding and empathy regarding the mental health challenges that law enforcement officers face, bridging gaps in understanding between the police and the communities they serve. Educational initiatives should also focus on mental resilience strategies, equipping officers with tools to manage stress effectively and navigate the complexities of their jobs without compromising their mental health. By promoting a culture of continuous learning and growth, law enforcement agencies can help officers develop a more nuanced understanding of strength, one that includes the capacity for introspection and seeking assistance when needed. # Normalizing Mental Health Struggles Normalizing mental health struggles as part of the human condition is crucial in combating stigma. This normalization involves openly discussing mental health issues in professional settings, sharing personal stories of challenge and recovery, and treating mental health with the same seriousness as physical health. When officers see their peers and leaders openly address mental health, it encourages a culture of transparency and support, demonstrating that they are not alone in their struggles. Peer support programs within law enforcement agencies can play a significant role in this process. These programs connect officers experiencing mental health challenges with colleagues who have navigated similar issues. By sharing experiences and coping strategies, these programs not only offer direct support but also serve as powerful testimonials to the strength found in vulnerability and mutual assistance. # Highlighting the Strength in Vulnerability The narrative shift must also involve highlighting the considerable strength it takes to confront personal challenges head-on. Acknowledging one's struggles, especially in a profession that prizes toughness, demonstrates a profound level of self-awareness and determination. It's about reframing the conversation to understand that the strongest individuals are those who accept their limitations, seek help to overcome them, and grow from the experience. Law enforcement leaders have a critical role to play in this narrative shift. When those at the top show vulnerability, share their own experiences with stress and mental health, and actively support their officers in seeking help, it sends a powerful message throughout the organization. Leadership advocacy for mental health resources, including confidential counseling services and wellness programs, further emphasizes that the officer’s well-being is a priority. # Conclusion Effectively combating the stigma around discussing stress and mental health in law enforcement necessitates a cultural and narrative transformation. This transformation requires redefining strength not as enduring in silence but as the courage to acknowledge vulnerability and actively seek support. Through education, normalization of mental health struggles, and highlighting the strength in vulnerability, the law enforcement community can foster a supportive environment. Such a shift not only benefits individual officers' mental health and well-being but also enhances the overall effectiveness of law enforcement agencies in serving and protecting communities. This change is not immediate, but through continuous effort, dialogue, and support, a new definition of strength can emerge, one rooted in resilience, growth, and the courage to face challenges head-on."},{"prompt":"elaborate using 300 words The stigma around discussing stress and mental health in law enforcement is a barrier to well-being and effectiveness, both for individual officers and the communities they serve.

By doing so, we can create a healthier, more resilient law enforcement community capable of serving with empathy, compassion, and strength.","completion":"The deeply ingrained stigma surrounding the discussion of stress and mental health within the law enforcement sector acts as a formidable obstruction, not only jeopardizing the mental well-being and operational efficacy of the officers themselves but also impacting the quality of service delivered to communities. Overcoming this stigma calls for a collective, strategic endeavor aimed at reshaping the prevailing cultural narratives that valorize emotional suppression as a form of strength. Instead, there must be a shift towards acknowledging mental health as a critical component of overall well-being and operational preparedness. Promoting open dialogues stands at the core of this transformative effort. Law enforcement agencies are encouraged to cultivate an environment where officers feel safe and supported in sharing their experiences and mental health challenges without fear of repercussion or judgment. This openness can be fostered through regular mental health awareness sessions, incorporating discussions on stress management and emotional well-being into continuous professional development programs, and highlighting success stories of officers who sought and received help. Accessibility to confidential support mechanisms is another crucial aspect. Providing officers with discreet avenues to seek help — whether through in-house mental health professionals or external resources — reassures them that their privacy is valued and that their careers are not at risk should they opt for assistance.

Such a culture not only fosters individual resilience and personal growth but also enhances team cohesiveness, operational efficiency, and public trust. This endeavor, while challenging, is neither elusive nor abstract. It requires deliberate, sustained efforts to redefine norms, values, and daily practices. The following delineates a strategic approach to cultivating an environment where openness and support are not only encouraged but ingrained. # Recognizing the Need for Change The initial step involves acknowledging the existing gaps in organizational culture where stigma, silence, or lack of support prevails. This recognition often stems from listening to the experiences and concerns of team members, reviewing outcomes where the lack of mental health support might have played a role, and understanding the broader impact of these gaps on mission fulfillment. Leadership buy-in is crucial at this stage; leaders must be willing to critically assess and recognize the need for a cultural shift towards more openness and support. # Setting a Vision for Transformation Leaders, alongside their teams, must articulate a clear, compelling vision for the cultural transformation they aim to achieve. This vision serves as a north star, guiding the development of new norms, policies, and initiatives focused on promoting openness and support. It answers the question, “What kind of organizational culture do we aspire to create?” and outlines the core values that underpin this aspiration, such as empathy, respect, resilience, and community. # Leading by Example For a culture of openness and support to flourish, leaders must model the behaviors they wish to see. This includes openly discussing their own experiences with stress, setbacks, or seeking help when needed. When leaders share their vulnerabilities, it normalizes such conversations and demonstrates that seeking support is not only acceptable but respected. Additionally, leaders should consistently show empathy, actively listen to team members, and provide constructive feedback, creating a safe space for others to do the same. # Implementing Structural Supports Beyond modeling desired behaviors, the organization must put in place structural supports to facilitate a culture of openness and support. This includes easily accessible mental health resources, training programs focusing on emotional intelligence and resilience, peer support systems, and clear, confidential pathways for seeking help. Policies should protect privacy and ensure that seeking support cannot adversely affect one’s career trajectory. These systemic changes signal organizational commitment to the well-being of its members and provide practical mechanisms for support. # Encouraging Open Dialogues Facilitating open dialogues about mental health, stress management, and support needs to be a continuous effort. This can be achieved through regular team meetings focused on well-being, workshops, and seminars with mental health professionals, and creating forums (both physical and virtual) where employees can share experiences, advice, and resources. These initiatives not only foster a sense of community but also provide ongoing education on the importance of mental health and available support options. # Normalizing Vulnerability and Support-Seeking To genuinely embed openness and support into the organizational fabric, it is crucial to normalize vulnerability and the act of seeking support. This involves reframing vulnerabilities not as weaknesses but as opportunities for growth and learning. Stories of resilience, recovery, and the positive impact of support should be highlighted and celebrated. Recognition programs can be introduced to honor those who contribute significantly to fostering a supportive environment, further incentivizing positive change. # Evaluating Progress and Sustaining Efforts Creating a culture of openness and support is an ongoing journey that necessitates regular evaluation and sustained efforts. Organizations should establish metrics to assess progress, such as employee well-being surveys, feedback mechanisms, and reviews of support resource utilization. Insights from these evaluations can guide continuous improvement, ensuring that the culture remains adaptive and responsive to the evolving needs of its members. # Conclusion Building a culture of openness and support is an investment in the collective health and success of any organization. By taking deliberate steps to foster this culture—rooted in empathy, respect, and communal support—organizations can unlock the full potential of their members, enhance operational effectiveness, and nurture a more resilient and engaged workforce.

This pivotal phase demands introspection, transparency, and a commitment from leadership and team members alike to shine a light on areas where the organization falls short in supporting mental wellness. The process, while challenging, is essential for setting the stage for meaningful change. # Listening to Team Members Acknowledgment begins with listening—actively and empathetically—to the experiences and concerns of team members. This can be facilitated through structured channels such as anonymous surveys, focus group discussions, or one-on-one conversations that provide employees with a safe space to voice their struggles, perceptions of the workplace culture, and suggestions for improvement. Such exercises are invaluable as they unearth the day-to-day realities of employees, often revealing undercurrents of stigma, instances of silence around mental health issues, and barriers to seeking support that might not be immediately obvious to leadership. # Reviewing Outcomes Another critical aspect of acknowledging gaps involves a thorough review of organizational outcomes where the lack of mental health support might have played a significant role. This could include trends of increased absenteeism, reduced productivity, high turnover rates, or even feedback from community engagements and customer service metrics. Analyzing these outcomes provides tangible evidence of how neglecting mental health can directly impact operational effectiveness, employee satisfaction, and the organization’s ability to fulfill its mission. # Understanding the Broader Impact It is also essential to understand the broader impact of these cultural gaps on the overall mission fulfillment and the well-being of employees. In positions of high stress, the consequences of neglecting mental health can extend beyond the workplace, affecting personal lives, overall health, and community interactions. For instance, in law enforcement agencies, the inability to discuss stress or mental health challenges openly can lead to increased instances of conflict within the community, affecting public trust and safety. In the corporate sector, it might result in poor decision-making, affecting the company's bottom line and reputation. # Leadership Buy-in Crucially, leadership buy-in at this stage cannot be overstated. Leaders at all levels must demonstrate a willingness to critically assess the current state of the organizational culture concerning mental health. This involves more than just acknowledgment; it requires a commitment to action. Leaders must champion the cause, showing a genuine understanding of the importance of a cultural shift and dedicating resources to make it happen. Their attitudes, responses, and openness to these issues set the tone for the rest of the organization. When leaders openly prioritize mental health, acknowledge their own challenges, and advocate for change, it sends a powerful message that seeking help and supporting one another is not only acceptable but expected. Engaging in this process of acknowledgment serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it validates the experiences of team members, making it clear that their well-being is valued. Secondly, it provides a clear-eyed view of the extent to which mental health issues, when unaddressed, can permeate and negatively impact various facets of the organization. Lastly, it lays the groundwork for building a comprehensive strategy toward a more supportive and open culture, one where mental health is integrated into the fabric of the organization’s ethos. The acknowledgment phase is, therefore, not just about identifying gaps; it's about setting intentions for change. It involves a commitment to transparency, continuous dialogue, and the development of strategies and policies that reinforce the importance of mental wellness. This process paves the way for initiatives that foster open dialogue, provide accessible and confidential mental health resources, and encourage a supportive network among employees. Ultimately, acknowledging existing gaps is the first, vital step towards transforming organizational culture into one that champions mental health, resilience, and mutual support, enhancing both individual and organizational well-being and effectiveness."},{"prompt":"Elaborate on this idea using 500-100 words.

It’s a forward-looking manifesto that illuminates the path from the current state to the aspirational culture, detailing the principles and behaviors that will be embraced along the way. Crafting this vision necessitates deep reflection and dialogue, inviting input from all levels of the organization to ensure it resonates widely and captures the collective aspirations of the workforce. It’s an exercise in imagining a workplace where every individual feels seen, heard, and supported; where mental health is not just a private concern but a communal priority, and where the courage to be vulnerable is met with unwavering support and understanding. This vision for transformation must be compelling enough to inspire action and dedication across the organization. It should articulate a clear departure from cultures of silence and stigma, painting a vivid picture of a future where openness is not merely tolerated but celebrated.

In the quest to cultivate an environment characterized by openness and support, the axiom of leading by example becomes not just relevant but essential. The dynamic of sharing personal experiences related to stress, adversities, or the pursuit of help by those in leadership positions acts as a powerful catalyst for cultural transformation. It dismantles the prevalent taboos surrounding vulnerability, subtly weaving the threads of open dialogue and mutual support into the fabric of the organization's culture. When leaders courageously step forward to discuss their own battles with stress or their journeys toward seeking support, it sends a potent message across the ranks that vulnerability is not a liability but a bridge to understanding and growth. This act of openness challenges the status quo, shifting perceptions and encouraging a more compassionate and supportive workplace ethos. It helps demystify the notion of invulnerability often associated with leadership roles, presenting a more relatable, human aspect of leadership that resonates deeply with employees at all levels. Moreover, the influence of leaders extends to their everyday interactions and the ethos they propagate through their actions. Empathy becomes a cornerstone of this cultural shift, with leaders actively practicing understanding and compassion in their dealings with team members. This empathy is coupled with the art of active listening — truly hearing and considering the perspectives and concerns of others without immediate judgment or dismissal. Such practices not only foster trust and respect but also encourage a reciprocal openness among team members, creating a ripple effect that permeates the entire organization. The provision of constructive feedback further enriches this culture, creating an environment where individuals feel valued and recognized for their contributions while also understanding areas for personal and professional growth. This feedback, when delivered with care and respect, reinforces the notion that the organization is invested in the well-being and development of its people, motivating individuals to engage more openly and supportively with one another. Leading by example, therefore, is not a passive endeavor but a proactive commitment to embodying the values of openness and support. It invites leaders to transcend traditional paradigms of authority, embracing a more inclusive and empathetic leadership style that champions mental and emotional well-being alongside professional achievement. By doing so, leaders not only enhance the resilience and cohesion of their teams but also lay the groundwork for a more compassionate and supportive organizational culture that thrives on mutual respect, understanding, and shared growth.

This requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing a variety of resources and policy frameworks that actively facilitate mental health awareness, emotional support, and personal growth among team members. Accessible mental health resources form the bedrock of this structural support, ensuring that every member of the organization knows where and how to seek help when they need it. This could range from in-house counseling services to subscriptions for external mental health apps, along with partnerships with local mental health practitioners. Moreover, training programs dedicated to enhancing emotional intelligence and resilience are key to proactively building a workforce adept at handling stress, recognizing signs of mental health struggles in themselves and others, and navigating the complexities of interpersonal dynamics with empathy and understanding. Such programs not only equip individuals with vital coping strategies but also foster a shared language around mental health and support, further normalizing these conversations. Peer support systems, meanwhile, leverage the inherent strength of the community within the organization. By connecting individuals who have navigated their own mental health journeys with those currently facing challenges, peer support systems offer a unique blend of empathy, mutual understanding, and practical advice, all grounded in personal experience. This peer-to-peer dynamic adds a layer of immediacy and relatability to the support structure, reinforcing the idea that one is never alone in their struggles. Finally, the effectiveness of these supports hinges on the accompanying policies and procedures that ensure confidentiality and safeguard against any career repercussions from seeking help. Clear, transparent policies must delineate how information is protected, who has access to it, and the steps taken to support an individual without jeopardizing their professional standing. This level of protection and assurance is critical in dismantling one of the significant barriers to seeking help—the fear of professional stigma or reprisal. These structural supports, when implemented thoughtfully and in concert with one another, signal a deep organizational commitment to the holistic well-being of its members. They provide tangible, practical mechanisms through which individuals can access support, build resilience, and thrive both personally and professionally. Moreover, they represent a shift away from piecemeal approaches to mental health, towards a more integrated, comprehensive strategy that views emotional well-being as integral to the overall success and health of the organization. By putting these structures in place, an organization does more than merely advocate for mental health and well-being; it embeds these ideals into the very fabric of its culture, creating an environment where support and openness are not just encouraged but actively facilitated and protected.

In the dynamic and often high-pressure environments that characterize today's workplaces, making space for such conversations is not just beneficial but essential. By integrating regular discussions on topics like mental health, stress management, and personal well-being into the rhythm of organizational life, companies can create a framework where openness is normalized and valued. One effective avenue for facilitating these dialogues is through regular team meetings dedicated to discussing well-being alongside operational agendas. Here, employees can share insights into their coping mechanisms, discuss challenges they are facing, and explore solutions in a supportive setting. This consistent focus acts as a reminder that the organization places a high value on the mental health of its members, equal to their professional contributions. Moreover, educational workshops and seminars presented by mental health professionals offer a valuable resource for deepening understanding and dismantling stigma. These sessions can provide practical advice on recognizing signs of mental distress, effective stress management techniques, and how to access available support services. Importantly, they also offer a professional perspective on mental health, lending credibility and seriousness to the discussions.

Such initiatives might spotlight individuals who readily offer assistance to colleagues, those who share their own experiences of navigating challenges, or leaders who consistently demonstrate empathy and understanding. Recognizing these contributions can serve multiple purposes: it visibly rewards positive behavior, sends a strong message about the organization’s values, and encourages others to emulate these supportive actions. Moreover, these efforts to normalize vulnerability and seeking assistance must be strategically integrated into the organization’s broader operating principles. This includes creating policies that protect employees who seek help, providing resources and training on mental health and well-being, and ensuring that managers and leaders are equipped to respond appropriately to disclosures of vulnerability.

To genuinely institutionalize this culture, organizations must commit to regular assessments of their progress and the effectiveness of implemented support systems. Establishing clear and meaningful metrics plays a critical role in this process. Tools such as employee well-being surveys offer tangible data on the mental and emotional health of the workforce, highlighting areas of success and those needing further attention. These surveys can probe into various aspects of workplace culture, including the ease with which employees feel they can discuss mental health concerns without fear of stigma, the adequacy and accessibility of support resources, and overall job satisfaction. In addition to surveys, feedback mechanisms such as suggestion boxes, dedicated email addresses for wellness suggestions, or regular open forums can serve as vital channels for direct input from employees. These avenues encourage an ongoing dialogue between staff at all levels and organizational leadership, fostering a sense of inclusivity and shared responsibility for the workplace culture. Moreover, reviewing the utilization of support resources provides a quantifiable measure of how the workforce engages with the available services. A high or increasing level of engagement can indicate that employees feel comfortable and supported in accessing help, whereas low utilization rates might signal barriers to access or a lingering stigma that needs to be addressed. The insights gained from these various evaluation tools are invaluable for guiding continuous improvement. They illuminate the effectiveness of current initiatives and reveal gaps in the support structure, enabling organizations to iteratively refine their approach. This process of constant feedback and refinement ensures that the culture of openness and support remains not only relevant but also deeply woven into the fabric of the organization. Sustaining these efforts over time requires a committed leadership that is willing to invest in the well-being of its employees consistently. It involves allocating necessary resources, including time, personnel, and finances, towards the development and maintenance of mental health initiatives. Moreover, it requires a dedication to learning — staying abreast of the latest research, best practices, and innovative approaches in organizational psychology and mental health support. Ultimately, by prioritizing regular evaluation and demonstrating a commitment to sustained efforts, organizations can cultivate a truly supportive culture. This culture champions the well-being of its members, contributes to the overall productivity and morale of the workforce, and creates a resilient organization adaptive to the changing needs of its employees. Through this process, an environment of openness becomes the cornerstone of the organizational ethos, reflecting a profound understanding that the strength of an organization lies in the health, happiness, and engagement of its people."},{"prompt":"ELABORATE USING AT LEAST 250 WORDS Conclusion Building a culture of openness and support is an investment in the collective health and success of any organization.

There are several key reasons for its negative reception: 1. **High System Requirements**: Upon its release in January 2007, Windows Vista demanded significantly higher hardware specifications from computers than its predecessor, Windows XP. Many existing PCs that were capable of running XP smoothly struggled with Vista, leading to poor performance and dissatisfaction among users. This was particularly noticeable in areas like system boot time, application launch times, and general responsiveness. 2. **Compatibility Issues**: A lot of existing software and hardware that worked seamlessly with Windows XP faced compatibility problems with Vista. This included popular applications and drivers for peripherals. Although such compatibility issues are not uncommon with the release of a new OS, the scale and impact were notably problematic with Vista, affecting both personal and business users. 3. **User Account Control (UAC)**: While intended to improve security by preventing unauthorized changes to the system, the implementation of UAC in Vista was widely criticized. Users found themselves bombarded with prompts asking for permission to continue with basic tasks, which became a source of frustration and led many to disable the feature altogether, ironically making their systems less secure. 4. **Software Bloat and Resource Intensiveness**: Vista introduced a range of new features, including the Aero graphical interface, which, while visually appealing, contributed to the system's heavy resource use. Many criticized Vista for being bloated, as it came packed with features and services that many users found unnecessary, further straining system resources and affecting performance. 5. **Initial Instability and Bugs**: Early versions of Vista were plagued by stability issues and bugs. Although many of these were addressed in subsequent updates and the release of Service Pack 1, the negative impression had already taken root among the user base. 6. **Bad Timing and Poor Public Perception**: Vista's launch came at a time when Windows XP had become deeply entrenched and widely appreciated for its stability and relatively modest system requirements. The stark contrast in performance and compatibility issues made the transition to Vista difficult for many, and negative word-of-mouth spread quickly. Over time, Microsoft addressed many of Vista's flaws with patches and the much-improved Service Pack 1 and Service Pack 2 updates. However, Vista's reputation never fully recovered, and many users either stuck with Windows XP or waited for its successor, Windows 7, which rectified many of Vista's missteps and was much better received by both critics and the general public upon its release in 2009. It's also worth noting that perceptions of \\"the worst Windows version\\" can vary based on individual and collective experiences. For example, Windows ME (Millennium Edition) also often features in discussions about less favorable versions of Windows due to its instability and problems."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I think of protestantism as an idealized and more secular form of christianity. Respond like a knowledgeable expert","completion":"The Council of Trent (or Tridentine Council), which spanned from 1545 to 1563, was a major event in the Counter-Reformation, the Catholic Church's response to the Reformation and the growing Protestant movements. Its main objectives were to address issues of abuse within the Church, to clarify Catholic doctrine, and to reassert Church discipline. To examine the assertion that the Counter-Reformation hindered scientific discoveries by comparing it to a perceived more secular Protestantism, we need to consider a few key points about religion, cultural context, and the Scientific Revolution. # Protestantism, Secularism, and Science It's important to contextualize the perception of Protestantism as more secular and conducive to scientific discovery. This viewpoint partly stems from the fact that several prominent figures in the early phases of the Scientific Revolution were indeed Protestants or came from Protestant regions. For instance, Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Isaac Newton made groundbreaking contributions in a religious landscape shaped significantly by the Reformation. The Protestant emphasis on reading the Bible encouraged literacy and education, indirectly fostering an environment conducive to scientific inquiry. Furthermore, the fragmentation of the Western Christian Church and the relative weakening of the Catholic Church's universal authority arguably allowed more freedom for intellectual pursuits outside the strict purview of Catholic dogma. # The Counter-Reformation and Science The Counter-Reformation, while primarily a religious movement, did have implications for the intellectual and scientific environment of Catholic countries. The reaffirmation of Papal authority and the strengthening of doctrinal orthodoxy could, in some cases, stifle intellectual and scientific inquiry, especially if it was perceived to challenge the theological foundations laid by the Church. The trial of Galileo Galilei in the 17th century, well after the Council of Trent, is often cited as an example of Catholic resistance to scientific ideas, specifically heliocentrism. However, it's vital to recognize that the Counter-Reformation was not monolithically anti-scientific. The Jesuit order, established shortly before the Council of Trent, was renowned for its contributions to education and the sciences. Jesuit scholars were prominent in fields such as astronomy, mathematics, and cartography. Their work in missions across the globe also contributed to ethnographic, linguistic, and botanical knowledge. # Conclusion The assessment that the Counter-Reformation hindered scientific discoveries by comparing it to a Protestantism perceived as more secular and conducive to scientific inquiry requires a nuanced understanding. While the reassertion of Church authority and the emphasis on orthodoxy had the potential to constrain intellectual freedom, it's an oversimplification to view the Counter-Reformation as wholly anti-scientific. The period following the Council of Trent was complex, with both Protestant and Catholic regions contributing to the burgeoning Scientific Revolution. The dynamics of scientific development were influenced by a multitude of factors, including but not limited to religious affiliation, making it difficult to attribute the rate or direction of scientific discoveries distinctly to the Counter-Reformation efforts."},{"prompt":"what does “oxe” mean in portoguese?","completion":"In Portuguese, \\"oxe\\" is an informal interjection commonly used in the Northeast region of Brazil, especially in states like Bahia.

Be specific and go into detail","completion":"Formal deconstruction in architecture refers to the process of dissecting and often reassembling elements of architectural design to understand or create new structures. This approach can uncover layers of meaning, historical influences, and structural elements in iconic buildings. Italian architecture, with its rich history, provides fertile ground for such analyses, especially when considering the work of architects like Andrea Palladio or the design of emblematic buildings like Il Gesù in Rome. # Andrea Palladio and the Overlayering of Facades Andrea Palladio (1508–1580) was a Renaissance architect whose designs have profoundly influenced Western architecture. His work is renowned for its symmetry, perspective, and values drawn from classical architecture. A key aspect of Palladio's approach was his ability to blend functionality with the grandiose aesthetics of ancient Rome, a technique evident in his villas and religious buildings. - **Villa Capra \\"La Rotonda\\"**: A prime example of Palladio’s architectural principles can be seen in the Villa Capra, commonly known as \\"La Rotonda.\\" Here, Palladio overlays the domestic facade of a country house with the grandiose elements of a classical temple, incorporating a domed central hall and a portico with columns on each of its four facades. This overlay not only merges the utilitarian with the ceremonial but also creates a seamless transition between interior and exterior spaces, integrating the building with its surrounding landscape in a manner that was revolutionary for its time. - **The Basilica Palladiana (Vicenza)**: In this public building, Palladio superimposed a new exterior loggia onto an existing medieval structure’s walls. The use of a serliana motif (an arch flanked by two smaller rectangular openings with columns) on the upper level and a series of arches on the lower level reflects a formal operation of layering different architectural languages - Roman triumphal arches on the ground floor and Renaissance serlian motifs above. This not only enhanced the building's aesthetic appeal but also reinforced structural integrity and public function. # Il Gesù in Rome - **Façade Design**: Il Gesù, the mother church of the Jesuit order, designed primarily by Giacomo della Porta, features a façade that incorporates elements of both Renaissance and Baroque architecture, signaling a transition between the two eras. The facade is divided vertically into two orders, each with a different set of columns and pilasters (the lower order featuring Tuscan Doric and the upper order featuring Composite), creating an overlap of architectural styles. This dual-layering serves to elevate the structure's grandeur and spiritual importance, setting a precedent for future Baroque churches. - **Interior Spatial Arrangement**: Inside, Il Gesù’s nave lacks aisles, which is a departure from the traditional basilica plan. Instead, side chapels are directly accessible from the nave, thereby focusing the visitors' attention on the high altar. This formal operation of deconstructing the conventional basilical layout and reassembling it into a more centralized, focused form was a deliberate move to serve the Counter-Reformation's goals, emphasizing a more personal, immersive experience of worship. These examples illustrate how formal deconstruction and overlaying of architectural elements were not merely aesthetic exercises but deeply rooted in functional, social, and spiritual objectives. Palladio’s work harmonizes classical ideals with modern needs, laying groundwork for future architectural developments, while Il Gesù exemplifies the dynamic transition from Renaissance to Baroque, reflecting the evolving religious and cultural landscapes of Italy."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[여자 문제에 있어서 마크는 청정구역이라고, 애슐리.] 애슐리는 다른 남자들과 다른 마크와 나의 태도에 사뭇 놀란 것 같았다. “마크, 난 스탠포드를 다녀서 그러는데. 하버드는 분위기가 어때요?” “글쎄요. 저도 학교는 잠깐 다녀서 잘 모르겠어요. 성국이가 우리 중에서는 학교생활도 가장 열심히 하고, 인기도 많았어요. 저야 항상 구석에서 너드처럼 구겨져 있어서요.” [역시 마크는 여자에게 인기 없을 만해.] 하지만 지금 이 순간은 마크만큼 내게 도움을 주는 사람은 없었다. 마크는 샴페인을 한 번에 쭉 들이켜더니 내 어깨에 손을 얹었다. “성국, 난 도저히 여기 체질에 안 맞아. 다들 어쩜 이렇게 가식적이야?” 나는 애슐리에게 웃으며 말했다. “애슐리, 제가 마크 좀 진정시키고 올게요. 그런 다음에 블러디테라피에 대해서 이야기해 줘요.” “여기서 전 친구들이랑 이야기하고 있을게요. 성국, 어서 다녀와요.” 나는 마크를 데리고 파티장 구석으로 갔다. 마크는 못마땅한 얼굴로 애슐리와 나를 번갈아 봤다. “성국, 너 저 여자한테 관심 있어?” “마크, 나 좀 도와줘.” “설마 저 여자랑 잘되게 도와달라는 거 아니지?” “마크, 너랑 나랑 몇 년인데. 넌 날 몰라?” “네가 여자랑 이렇게 다정하게 이야기하는 건 거의 본 적이 없잖아. 거기다 저 여자는 제시에 비하면 뭐 외모도 그렇잖아.” 나는 빙긋 미소를 지었다. “마크, 난 저 여자가 사기꾼이라는 것을 이제부터 한 달 안에 밝힐 거야.” “어?” 마크의 눈이 더 커졌다. “성국, 그게 무슨 말이야? 애슐리 홈즈가 사기꾼이라니! 저 여자 관련 기사는 저명한 과학 전문 잡지에 엄청 실렸어.” “원래 사기꾼들은 그렇게 시작하는 거야. 저명한 잡지에 자기 이름을 올리는 것부터.” 마크는 샴페인을 한 잔 더 마셨다. “성국, 나는 어떻게 도우면 돼?” “저 여자가 우리에게 접근한 이유는 하나야.” “그게 뭐야?” “바로 우리에게 투자한 투자자들을 가로채겠다는 거야. 피터를 시작으로 빌과 찰리까지.” “그게 가능해?” 마크는 놀란 눈으로 연신 나를 쳐다봤다. “불가능하게 만들어야지. 우리가.” “성국, 나 갑자기 심장이 두근거려. 근데 기분이 되게 좋아. 마치 넌 007의 제임스 본드가 된 것 같고, 난 M16 기지의 조사관 같아.” “마크, 우선 망상은 접고. 오늘 우리의 목적은 하나야.” “뭔데?” “애슐리 홈즈랑 친구가 된 척하기. 단, 절대로 ‘페이스 노트’ 친구는 해주면 안 돼.” “왜?” “나중에 사기꾼인 게 밝혀졌을 때, 언론에서는 어떻게든 우리랑 엮으려고 할 거거든.” “근데, 친구 맺기 신청했는데. 안 맺어주기도 어렵잖아.” “마크, 넌 ‘페이스 노트’의 CEO야. 창의적인 거짓말을 좀 생각해 봐! 자, 애슐리 홈즈가 우리 둘이 너무 오래 이야기하면 의심할지도 몰라.” “성국, 이제 가보자고!” 마크는 내 등을 먼저 앞으로 쓱 밀었다. * * * 애슐리 홈즈는 내가 익히 잘 아는 남자와 이야기 중이었다. 바로 제리 창. 제리 창은 나를 보더니 얼굴이 굳었다. 마크가 뒤에서 속삭였다. “성국, 제리잖아. 너 저번에 그 반면교사 메일 보냈어?” “흠. 사실은 마셜 제도 가느라 깜빡했어.” “그나마 다행이네.” 그나마 다행이긴 했지만, 제리의 표정을 보니 곧 나를 목 졸라 죽일 것만 같았다. 나는 침착하게 웃으며 다가갔다. “안녕, 제리. 오랜만이에요.” “성국, 제리도 알아요?” 애슐리 홈즈는 상기된 얼굴로 물었다. “제리가 ‘페이스 노트’를 인수하고 싶어 했거든요. 그만큼 제리는 보는 눈이 있는 투자자예요.” 나는 제리를 살짝 띄워줬다. 제리의 입꼬리가 슬쩍 올라가는 게 보였다. “제리, 그럼. ‘페이스 노트’에 투자했어요?” “성국이 단번에 거절했어요.” “제리, 잘못 알고 있는 거예요. 거절은 제가 했어요!” 마크가 뒤에서 나섰다. 리미미 때문에 마크가 제리의 제안을 거절한 것은 정말 신의 한 수였다. 제리는 당황한 기색이 역력했다. “애슐리, 우리 이야기는 다음에 더 해요.” “물론이죠, 제리.” 애슐리는 은근슬쩍 제리의 팔뚝을 훑었다. [하아, 미성년자 앞에서 뭐 하는 짓이야!] 나는 깡생수를 들이켰다. 애슐리는 눈웃음을 지으며 다시 나와 마크에게 다가왔다. “성국, 언제 우리 회사에 안 놀러올래요? 내가 지금 개발하고 있는 혈액 진단 키트 보여줄게요.” [나라니? 애슐리, 그거 혼자 개발하는 것도 아니잖아.] 하지만 난 정말 그 키트를 보고 싶다는 듯이 대꾸했다. “안 그래도 블러드테라피 정말 한번 구경 가고 싶었어요.” “이렇게 된 거 파티를 한 번 열어야겠어요. 우리 사무실에서요. 둘 다 와줄 거죠?” “당연하죠.” 난 고개를 끄덕였다. * * * 여전히 마크와 나, 리미미는 같은 숙소에서 지냈다. 마크는 수다스럽게 리미미에게 애슐리 홈즈에 대해서 떠들어댔다. “애슐리 홈즈. 완전 푸석푸석한 금발에 눈만 동그랗게 커서는, 말할 때마다 남자들 팔을 만지는 거야. 완전 자기가 팜므 파탈인 줄 아는 것 같아.” “정말?” “응. 성국이가 미성년자인 줄 모를 때는 막 접근하다가 미성년자인 거 알고는 나한테 막 접근하려는 거. 내가 엄청 투덜거리면서 도망쳤어. 잘했지, 미미 씨?” “마크, 리미미 씨가 엄마는 아니잖아. 그만 고자질해.” 나는 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. “성국, 우리가 너무 떠들었지?” “괜찮아. 더 떠들어도 돼.” “근데, 성국. 미미 씨한테 네가 애슐리 홈즈가 사기꾼인 거 밝히려고 한다는 거 말해도 돼?” “하아… 마크. 이미 말하고 있잖아.” “아, 그게.” “성국, 못 들은 척할게요. 북조선에서는 입 잘못 놀리면 아오지라 저 입 엄청 무거워요.” “고마워요, 리미미 씨.” 나는 얼른 노트북을 열었다. 그리고 ‘페이스 노트’를 살폈다. “성국, 그 여자가 친구 신청했는지 보는 거야?” “응.” “친구 신청했어?” “아니. 마크, 너도 확인해 봐.” 마크는 노트북을 열어 ‘페이스 노트’를 확인하더니 고개를 저었다. “안 했어. 성국, 이 여자 완전 또라이 아니야? 자기가 먼저 친구 신청하겠다고 호언장담하고는 파티 끝난 게 몇 시인데, 아직 신청도 안 했어.” “예상한 대로네.” 나는 조용하게 중얼거렸다. 역시 애슐리 홈즈는 소시오패스였다. 자신의 목적을 위해서 모두를 도구로 생각하는 여자. 마크가 의아한 얼굴로 물었다. “성국, 애슐리가 친구 신청 안 할 것을 예상했다고?” “응. 그 여자는 우리를 사람이 아니라 도구로 보거든. 도구들이랑 친구할 이유는 없잖아. 자신의 목적을 이루기 전까지는 말이야.” “그 말은 우리가 빌과 찰리 같은 거물 인사를 소개해주기 전까지는 속으로는 우리를 사람 취급도 안 할 거란 말이지?” “응.” 난 단호하게 고개를 끄덕였다. 소시오패스와의 싸움이라…. 기대가 된다. [애슐리 기다려. 난 독보적인 나르시스트거든!]","completion":"Episode 175 Ashley Holmes! A woman who scammed the world with Blood Therapy! Blood Therapy announced the development of 'Thomas', a medical kit that could test for over 250 different diseases with just a few drops of blood. It caused a huge sensation and received various investments, but later it was all revealed to be a lie. Ashley Holmes was once revered as the second coming of Charlie Jobs in the United States, but after the scam was revealed, it became known as the American version of the Hwang Woo-suk scandal in South Korea. And it was one of the few mistakes I made in my previous life. Investing in Blood Therapy. Jeon Joo-shin, the chairman who founded Samjeon Group, passed away suddenly from a myocardial infarction, despite his advanced age. And I was no different. Despite always taking the best care of my health, genetic diseases tend to appear suddenly. Fortunately, I dodged it, but in the case of my youngest sibling, Jeon Mi-jin, the neurotic disease inherited from our iron lady maternal side also became the reason for her nasty personality. Samjeon Group has always donated large sums to the medical field for various reasons, even establishing the best hospital in South Korea. Naturally, my interest was drawn to 'Thomas', the hottest issue at the time, a blood diagnostic kit. The idea that a few drops of blood could diagnose over 200 diseases was especially convenient for someone like me, a vice-chairman of Samjeon Group, who had to travel around the world, rather than going to a hospital. For various reasons, I invested in Blood Therapy, and 10 years later, the company's value converged to zero. [I won't just be a victim in this life, Ashley Holmes.] Ashley Holmes blinked her distinctive large eyes. Her hair, dyed blonde, was frizzy, but it was appropriate for her image as a pretty blonde woman focused on research to others. Peter seemed utterly fascinated by Ashley Holmes' research. \\"Seong-guk, Ashley is really amazing. She got a scholarship to Stanford.\\" [It's a lie from the start.] She was from Stanford, but the scholarship was a lie. Peter continued to introduce Ashley Holmes. \\"Imagine, she secured this technology during a pharmaceutical company internship over the summer break and, like you, dropped out of school to start a business. If there's 'Face Note' in the East, there's Blood Therapy in the West.\\" \\"That's right.\\" I replied out of politeness. [Peter, I'll make you regret comparing me to a scammer within a month.] I swallowed my anger and drank some water. At that moment, I felt Ashley Holmes looking at me very stickily. Peter patted my shoulder. \\"Seong-guk, you guys keep talking. I think I need to meet a Republican senator over there.\\" \\"Go ahead, Peter.\\" As Peter disappeared, Ashley approached me blatantly. \\"Seong-guk, I joined 'Face Note'. Can I send you a friend request?\\" \\"Of course.\\" [Of course, I won't accept your friend request, Ashley.] Ashley was wearing a black dress with a deep neckline and kept stroking her neck. [Ashley, are you trying to seduce me now?] To reveal or not to reveal. Or should I use the fact that she's a minor to bring her down? I shook my head. It would be troublesome to get entangled in a scandal myself. I smiled at Ashley Holmes as if I was interested. [I'm a former child model. This is all an act, Ashley.] Ashley kept waving her hand in the air and smiling. \\"Seong-guk, where did 'Face Note' get its investment from this time?\\" \\"It was widely reported in the news. Bill Gates and Charlie Jobs led the investment.\\" \\"Of course, I saw that news.\\" [You're seeing me as a complete fool, wanting me to connect you with them.] I drank some water. Ashley smiled and offered me champagne. \\"Seong-guk, don't just drink water, have some champagne.\\" \\"I'm a minor. I'll get arrested if I drink, Ashley.\\" \\"Really?\\" Ashley seemed genuinely unaware. [As expected of a scammer, your research is shallow, Ashley.] Ashley smiled awkwardly. \\"I thought you were a Harvard student. I assumed you were around my age. Plus, you're so tall. Anyway, I'm really sorry.\\" Ashley gulped down the champagne. Just then, Mark, tired of the people, approached me. \\"Seong-guk, what are you doing?\\" \\"I'm talking with Ashley Holmes, who founded a venture company called Blood Therapy.\\" \\"Ah, I've read an article introducing that company.\\" Mark cheerfully greeted Ashley. Ashley, showing her teeth with a seductive smile, extended her hand. \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from Blood Therapy. Mark, you're not a minor, are you?\\" \\"Ah, you already knew Seong-guk is a minor. No, I'm not.\\" Mark took Ashley's hand. However, as everyone knows, Mark was as faithful as a dandelion to his love. When Ashley held his hand for too long without letting go, he quickly shook off her hand. [Mark is a no-go zone for women, Ashley.] Ashley seemed quite surprised by the different attitudes of Mark and me. \\"Mark, I went to Stanford. How's the atmosphere at Harvard?\\" \\"Well, I only briefly attended school, so I'm not sure. Seong-guk was the most diligent and popular among us. I was always crumpled up in a corner like a nerd.\\" [As expected, Mark is unpopular with women.] But at this moment, there was no one more helpful to me than Mark. Mark gulped down his champagne and put his hand on my shoulder. \\"Seong-guk, I really can't stand this place. How can everyone be so pretentious?\\" I smiled at Ashley. \\"Ashley, let me calm Mark down a bit. Then let's talk about Blood Therapy.\\" \\"I'll be here talking with my friends. Seong-guk, come back soon.\\" I took Mark to a corner of the party hall. Mark looked at Ashley and me alternately with a displeased face. \\"Seong-guk, are you interested in that woman?\\" \\"Mark, help me out.\\" \\"You're not asking me to help you get along with her, are you?\\" \\"Mark, how long have we known each other? Don't you know me?\\" \\"I've hardly ever seen you talk so intimately with a woman. And compared to Jessie, that woman's appearance...\\" I smiled faintly. \\"Mark, I'm going to reveal that she's a scammer within a month.\\" \\"What?\\" Mark's eyes widened. \\"Seong-guk, what do you mean? Ashley Holmes is a scammer! Her related articles were published in renowned scientific magazines.\\" \\"Scammers usually start by getting their names in renowned magazines.\\" Mark drank another glass of champagne. \\"Seong-guk, how can I help?\\" \\"She approached us for one reason.\\" \\"What's that?\\" \\"To snatch away the investors who invested in us, starting with Peter and up to Bill and Charlie.\\" \\"Is that possible?\\" Mark looked at me with surprised eyes. \\"We have to make it impossible. Together.\\" \\"Seong-guk, my heart is suddenly racing. But I feel really good. It's like you've become James Bond of 007, and I'm an investigator at MI6.\\" \\"Mark, first, let's put aside the delusions. Our goal today is one.\\" \\"What is it?\\" \\"To pretend to be friends with Ashley Holmes. But, we must never accept a 'Face Note' friend request.\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"When it's revealed that she's a scammer, the media will try to link us with her in any way possible.\\" \\"But if she sends a friend request, it's hard not to accept.\\" \\"Mark, you're the CEO of 'Face Note'. Think of a creative lie! Now, if Ashley Holmes sees us talking too long, she might get suspicious.\\" \\"Seong-guk, let's go!\\" Mark pushed me forward. * * * Ashley Holmes was talking with a man I knew well. Jerry Chang. Seeing me, Jerry's face hardened. Mark whispered from behind. \\"Seong-guk, it's Jerry. Did you send that counter-teacher email last time?\\" \\"Hmm. Actually, I forgot because I went to the Marshall Islands.\\" \\"That's a relief.\\" It was a relief, but Jerry's expression seemed like he was about to strangle me to death. I approached calmly with a smile. \\"Hello, Jerry. Long time no see.\\" \\"Seong-guk, you know Jerry?\\" Ashley Holmes asked with an excited face. \\"Jerry wanted to acquire 'Face Note'. That's how much of an insightful investor Jerry is.\\" I slightly praised Jerry. \\"Jerry, did you invest in 'Face Note'?\\" \\"Seong-guk rejected it outright.\\" \\"Jerry, you're mistaken. I was the one who rejected it!\\" Mark stepped forward. Thanks to Mark, rejecting Jerry's offer was truly a godsend. Jerry looked flustered. \\"Ashley, let's talk more next time.\\" \\"Of course, Jerry.\\" Ashley subtly stroked Jerry's forearm. [Sigh, what are you doing in front of a minor!] I gulped down my water. Ashley approached Mark and me again with a smile. \\"Seong-guk, when will you visit our company? I'll show you the blood diagnostic kit I'm currently developing.\\" [I wonder? Ashley, you're not developing it alone.] But I replied as if I was really interested in seeing the kit. \\"I've really wanted to visit Blood Therapy.\\" \\"Let's have a party then. At our office. You'll both come, right?\\" \\"Of course.\\" I nodded. * * * Mark, Limi, and I still stayed in the same accommodation. Mark chattered to Limi about Ashley Holmes. \\"Ashley Holmes. Totally frizzy blonde hair, only her eyes are big, and she keeps touching men's arms when she talks. She totally thinks she's a femme fatale.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yes. She approached me aggressively until she found out Seong-guk was a minor, then she started approaching me. I grumbled and ran away. Did I do well, Ms. Limi?\\" \\"Mark, Ms. Limi isn't your mom. Stop tattling.\\" I shook my head. \\"Seong-guk, did we talk too much?\\" \\"It's okay. You can talk more.\\" \\"But, Seong-guk. Can I tell Ms. Limi that you're going to expose Ashley Holmes as a scammer?\\" \\"Sigh... Mark. You're already telling her.\\" \\"Ah, that's...\\" \\"Seong-guk, I'll pretend I didn't hear. In North Korea, if you slip up with your words, you're sent to Aoji, so my mouth is really heavy.\\" \\"Thank you, Ms. Limi.\\" I quickly opened my laptop. And browsed 'Face Note'. \\"Seong-guk, are you checking if that woman sent a friend request?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Did she send one?\\" \\"No. Mark, you check too.\\" Mark opened his laptop, checked 'Face Note', and shook his head. \\"She didn't. Seong-guk, this woman is totally crazy, right? She boasted she would send a friend request, and it's been hours since the party ended, and she still hasn't sent one.\\" \\"As expected.\\" I muttered quietly. Ashley Holmes was indeed a sociopath. She saw everyone as tools for her own purposes. Mark asked with a puzzled look. \\"Seong-guk, you expected Ashley not to send a friend request?\\" \\"Yes. She sees us not as people but as tools. There's no reason to be friends with tools until she achieves her goal.\\" \\"That means she won't treat us as people until she gets introductions to big shots like Bill and Charlie?\\" \\"Yes.\\" I nodded firmly. A battle with a sociopath... I'm looking forward to it. [Ashley, wait. I'm a unique narcissist!]"},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[애슐리 홈즈 뒷바라지해주다 나중에 차이는 남자군.] “어디서 오신 누구신지 말씀해주시겠어요?” 애슐리 홈즈는 자연스럽게 연기했다. [뭐야, 둘이 그렇고 그런 사이인 거 내가 다 안다고.] 하지만 나는 입을 꾹 다물고 두 사람의 연기를 지켜봤다. “전 GK 투자사의 존 칸입니다.” “존, 그럼 앞으로 나와 주시겠어요?” “네.” 존 칸은 앞으로 나가서 팔을 걷었다. 이때, 애슐리 홈즈가 당황한 연기를 펼치기 시작했다. “어머… 오늘 갑작스럽게 받은 질문 때문에 여기까지 왔는데, 채혈해주실 의료진을 제가 이 파티에 못 모셨네요. 제가 해도 되지만, 아무래도 실험의 공정성을 위해서는 이렇게 우발적인 자리가 아니라 의료진을 모시고 해야겠지요.” [미꾸라지처럼 빠져나가긴….] 나는 다시 손을 번쩍 들었다. 애슐리 홈즈는 미간을 슬쩍 찌푸리고 나를 가리켰다. “우리 전성국 대표님이 궁금증이 참 많네요.” “말씀하신 것만 들었을 때는 ‘토마스’는 일반 약국 어디에서든 소비자가 사서 검사하는 거 아닌가요?” “맞습니다.” “그렇다면 모든 소비자가 의료진은 아니지 않을까요? 저는 지금 상황에서 검사하는 게 더 ‘토마스’의 취지와 맞지 않을까 하는 생각이 드는데요.” 사람들도 웅성거리기 시작했다. 애슐리 홈즈는 답을 찾는 듯 큰 눈을 몇 번 굴리더니, 나를 쳐다봤다. “물론 ‘토마스’의 취지는 그렇죠. 하지만 제가 이 지점을 말씀 안 드린 것 같네요. 저희 블러드테라피는 아직 불안정하지만 투자를 통해서 완전해지기를 기다리는 회사라는 점을요.” “250여 가지의 질병을 검사할 수 있단 것도 그럼 아직 아니라는 말이죠?” “앞으로는 될 겁니다. 물론 거기에는 연구와 인력이 필요합니다.” 애슐리 홈즈는 내 질문을 더 받기 싫은 듯 눈길을 피하고는 사람들을 쳐다봤다. “아마 아직 불확실한 결과에 대해서 믿지 못하시는 분들이 분명 여기 계실 것이라고 생각합니다. 당연히 아직 블러드테라피의 ‘토마스’는 불안정합니다. 하지만 여러분들의 믿음과 투자가 있다면 몇 년 안에 분명 이 키트가 미국 전역에서 판매되고 있을 것이라는 미래를 약속드립니다.” 애슐리 홈즈의 말에 박수가 터져 나왔다. 나는 전태국을 흘깃 쳐다봤다. 전태국 역시 열광적으로 박수를 치고 있었다. 마크가 옆에 와서 속삭였다. “성국, 결국은 아직 이룬 게 아무것도 없단 말 아니야?” “그렇지. ‘페이스 노트’는 분명 실체가 있었지만, ‘토마스’는 저 허접한 샘플 빼고는 아무것도 없는 거나 마찬가지야.” “근데 사람들은 왜 이렇게 열광하는 거야?” “믿고 싶으니까. 키트 하나로 250여 가지의 병을 검사할 수 있단 저 여자의 말을 믿고 싶어서 그러는 거야.” 나는 무겁게 팔짱을 꼈다. 믿음만큼 무서운 것은 세상에 없었다. 나는 이제 그 믿음을 깨부숴야 하는 것이다. * * * 태국이 샴페인을 들고 우리에게 다가왔다. “성국, 마크. 여기서 얼굴을 다 보고 어쩐 일이야?” “태국이 형은 여기 투자하려는 거예요?” “응. 매우 관심 있어. 너희 둘도?” “난 밥 먹으러 왔어.” 마크는 연어롤을 먹으면서 고개를 저었다. “성국, 넌 관심 있는 거야?” “조금은요. 형, 근데 아직 너무 결과가 없어서 믿음이 안 가긴 하네요.” 나는 정보를 조금 흘렸다. 이 정보를 듣고 깨달을 정도라면 전태국도 사업가로서의 자질은 충분했다. “흠… 앞으로 할 일이 더 많은 기업이라는 의미 아닐까? 들어보니까 시작이 ‘페이스 노트’랑 얼추 비슷하더라고. ‘페이스 노트’도 그간 성장해서 이제 막 투자받고 커지는 중이잖아.” “태국, 미안한데. 우리 ‘페이스 노트’랑 블러드테라피를 비교하는 건 좀 그렇지. 우리는 실체가 있지만, 여긴 과학 저널에 실린 아이디어만 있을 뿐 솔직히 어떤 뚜렷한 결과가 없잖아.” 마크가 ‘페이스 노트’에 블러트테라피를 비교하자 발끈했다. “너희들이 ‘페이스 노트’ 창업자들이라 그렇게 생각하는지 모르지만, 투자자가 외부에서 보기엔 비슷하단 말이었어. 둘 다 가능성은 있지만, 미래는 확인되지 않은 거잖아.” [그래, 하나는 쪽박. 하나는 대박이지.] 태국의 말에 발끈한 나머지는 나는 깡생수를 벌컥벌컥 들이켰다. 거기다 태국은 눈치도 없이 말을 덧붙였다. “솔직히 ‘페이스 노트’는 너무 뻣뻣한데, 애슐리 홈즈는 투자자들을 유치하기 위해서 이런 파티도 하고. 정말 끝내주지 않아?” “태국이 형, 형은 이 싸구려 캐비어에 샴페인으로 겨우 구색을 갖춘 이런 파티가 마음에 들어요?” “아직 시작하는 기업이잖아. 난 이런 것을 보면 막 시작하는 회사에서 투자자들을 위해서 애썼다는 생각이 들어서 말이야. 솔직히 ‘페이스 노트’는 맨날 피자나 먹잖아.” [전태국! 지금 그 말한 거 내가 후회하게 만들어 주겠어!] 나는 깡생수를 또 들이켰다. 전태국이 내 등을 도닥였다. “성국, 너무 열 내지 마. 너라고 해서 언제나 1등을 할 수는 없잖아. 애슐리 홈즈에게 스포트라이트 빼앗기는 기분이라 그런 거지?” “그런 거 아니에요.” 전태국은 입꼬리를 올려 웃더니 샴페인을 털어 넣었다. “그래, 말들은 다 그렇게 하지.” 순간, 나는 애슐리 홈즈가 왜 나를 불렀는지 어렴풋이 알 것 같았다. 애슐리 홈즈는 ‘페이스 노트’의 창업자인 나와 마크를 불러 투자자들의 관심을 불러일으켰다. 하지만 내가 던진 질문이 다 맞는 말이라도 해도 비슷하게 성장하는 벤처 기업의 대표가 던지는 질문은 그저 시기 어린 것으로 치부하기 딱 좋았다. [내가 당한 건가….] 이때, 애슐리 홈즈가 웃음을 흘리며 다가왔다. 옆에는 제리 창이 있었다. 애슐리 홈즈는 일부러 전태국 앞에서 제리 창과 친한 척 귓속말까지 나눴다. [질투 유발인가? 설마 전태국, 애슐리 홈즈에게 눈독 들이는 건 아니지?] 내가 전태국을 쳐다보는 순간, 나는 전태국의 눈에서 한 번도 보지 못한 투지라는 것을 볼 수 있었다. [하아, 골치 아프군. 그런 정성은 제발 삼전 그룹에 쏟으라고!] 나는 얼른 마크를 끌었다. “마크, 우리는 집에 가자. 더는 볼 게 없을 것 같아.” 그때였다. 애슐리 홈즈가 나를 보며 다가왔다. 동시에 제리 창과 전태국의 시선이 그대로 나에게 박혔다. 애슐리 홈즈는 내 볼을 살짝 꼬집었다. [애슐리, 뭐 하는 수작이야? 나 전태국이나 제리 창처럼 쉬운 남자 아니야.] 나는 기분 나쁜 투로 애슐리의 손을 쳐냈다. “성국, 정말 여기까지 와주고 너무 고마워요. 아까 질문들 너무 예리해서 깜짝 놀랐지 뭐예요.” “궁금해서 물어봤을 뿐이에요. 애슐리, 아직 그 정도 데이터도 안 나온 건가요? 저희랑 시작이 비슷하다면 적어도 그 정도 데이터는 가지고 일을 시작해야 할 것 같은데요.” “의학 분야는 긴 투자가 필요한 곳이잖아요. 인류를 구원하는 일이 몇 년 만에 해결되는 건 아니잖아요.” [말은 청산유수지…] “인류를 구원하는 일이 파티나 한다고 되는 것도 아닌 것 같은데요.” “우선 투자를 받기 위해서는 저도 이런 일이 체질이 아니지만, 해야 하는 거잖아요.” 마크도 공격적으로 애슐리 홈즈를 쳐다봤다. “애슐리, 모든 벤처 기업들이 이런 파티를 해서 투자자를 모은다는 망상을 심어주는 건 안 좋을 것 같아요.” “마크랑 성국은 뭐랄까. 성격이 좀 공격적이네요. 우리 파티가 마음에 안 드세요?” 애슐리 홈즈는 난처한 표정을 지었고, 그럴 때마다 우리를 보는 남자들의 시선은 싸늘해졌다. 나는 마크에게 속삭였다. “마크, 오늘은 그만 가는 게 졸겠어.” 그러곤 나는 애슐리 홈즈를 쳐다봤다. “애슐리, ‘토마스’라는 키트를 검사하는 블러드테라피의 성능은 언제쯤 볼 수 있을까요?” “저희는 매주 사람들을 초청할 생각이에요. 관심 있으면 언제든 오세요.” “다음에 봤을 때는 오늘처럼 말로만 안 때웠으면 좋겠어요, 애슐리.” “성국, 무섭게 왜 그래요? 나를 경쟁 상대로 여겨주는 건 고맙지만, 경쟁 상대를 깔고 뭉갤 필요까지는 없잖아요. 안 그래요?” 남자들의 시선은 더욱 차가워졌고, 마크가 나를 얼른 잡아당겼다. “성국, 여기 우린 있어봤자 손해인 것 같아. 어서 나가자.” 나는 애슐리의 마지막 말에 대꾸도 않고 파티장을 빠져나왔다. * * * 파티장을 다 빠져나왔을 무렵, 내 시선에 한 남자가 들어왔다. 바로 존 칸. 아까 나와 경쟁하듯 손을 든 남자였다. 이 파티에 온 사람들은 모두 존 칸 자신이 말한 대로 GK 투자사에서 나온 것으로 알 것이다. 물론 지금은 GK 투자사에 있을 수도 있다. 하지만 존 칸의 진짜 정체는 애슐리 홈즈와 연인 사이라는 사실이다. 동시에 이 건물을 얻고 이런 파티를 여는 데 쓴 돈도 사실은 모두 존 칸의 돈이다. 저번 생에서 애슐리 홈즈에게 투자 사기를 당하고 재조사하면서 알게 된 일이었다. 존 칸은 조금 씁쓸한 얼굴로 남자 투자자들 사이에 둘러싸인 애슐리 홈즈를 멀리서 쳐다보고 있었다. 나는 마크의 어깨를 잡았다. “마크, 난 저 사람이랑 이야기 좀 하고 갈게.” “그래, 성국. 난 밖에서 신선한 공기 좀 쐬고 있을게. 여긴 너무 답답해.” “응.” 나는 마크를 먼저 보내고 조용히 존 칸에게 다가갔다. “안녕하세요. 아까 저보다 먼저 지원을 하셔서 놀랐어요. 제가 제일 빨리 손을 든 줄 알았거든요.” “아, ‘페이스 노트’의 전성국 대표 맞죠?” “네, 맞습니다. 정식으로 인사드릴게요. 전성국이라고 합니다.” “저는 존 칸이예요. 아까 말했듯이 GK 투자사에서 일하고 있고요.” 존 칸을 애써 미소를 지어 보였다. 뭔가 이 상황이 마음에 안 드는 것 같아 보였다. [흠… 그럼, 질투를 유발해볼까….] 나는 은근히 애슐리 홈즈를 가리켰다. “애슐리 홈즈의 이 회사는 특히 남자 투자자들이 관심을 많이 가지네요. 아무래도 애슐리 홈즈가 미인이라서 그런가 봐요.” [내 기준에 미인은 절대 아니야.] 하지만 나는 이 상황을 나의 뛰어난 연기력으로 커버하고 있었다. 존 칸의 미간이 살짝 구겨지는 게 보였다. “그것보다는 다들 블러드테라피의 가능성을 보는 거겠죠.” “물론 키트 하나로 250여 가지의 질병을 검사한다는 말은 멋있죠. 하지만 이미 독일의 지멘수 사에서 그보다 훨씬 적은 수의 검사를 하는 기계는 있잖아요. 그렇다면 블러드테라피보다는 이미 기술력을 보유하고 있는 지멘수 사에 투자하는 게 더 옳은 투자 아닐까요?” “흠… 새로운 정보 감사합니다.” 존 칸은 쉽게 속내를 드러내는 타입은 아니었다. 그렇다면 쐐기를 박는 수밖에. “암튼 저 여자 조심하세요. 제가 미성년자라서 그렇지, 은근히 터치가 좀 심하더라고요. 아까 제 볼도 꼬집었거든요. 저 기술로 남자 투자자들을 모으는 것 같아요.” “그래서 성국 군은 넘어갔나요?” “아니요. 전 미성년자잖아요. 저한테 찝쩍였다가는 애슐리가 바로 감옥행이죠.” 존 칸의 얼굴이 굳는 게 보였다. “농담이에요! 제 말은 다 잊어주세요. 미인이 이런 멋진 회사를 일으켜 세운 게 질투 나서 그랬어요.” “성국 군도 못지않은 미남인데요.” “다행히 ‘페이스 노트’에는 제 얼굴 안 보는 남자 투자자들밖에 없네요. 그럼, 파티 더 즐기다 오세요. 저는 일이 있어서요.” 나는 마지막으로 존 칸의 표정을 살피고 파티장을 빠져나왔다. 존 칸은 내가 빠져나가는 것과 상관없이 애슐리 홈즈가 다른 투자자들과 어울리는 것을 뚫어져라 쳐다보고 있었다. “성국, 아까 그 존 칸이라는 사람이랑은 무슨 이야기한 거야?” 산책하고 있던 마크가 주머니에 손을 넣고 다가왔다. “존 칸은 애슐리 홈즈의 조력자야. 정확히 말하면 애인 같은 거….” “성국, 그걸 어떻게 알았어?” “아까 피를 몇 방울 달라고 할 때 말이야. 내가 분명 먼저 손을 들었거든.” “그럼, 둘이 짜고 그랬다는 거야?” “응.” 마크는 놀라서 파티장을 한 번 뒤돌아봤다. “애슐리 완전 나쁜 여자네. 그래서 존 칸한테 뭐라고 했어?” “애슐리가 남자 투자자들한테 추근거린다고 했어.” 순간 마크가 놀라서 그 자리에 멈춰 섰다. “성국….” “왜?” “너도 완전….” “나쁜 놈이라고?” “어.” 마크는 고개를 끄덕였다. “마크, 난 이기는 것에만 관심 있어.”","completion":"Episode 177 Ashley Holmes glared at me with a smile disguised as her eyes. Perhaps there was already someone among the audience who had decided to raise their hand. And just as I expected, Ashley Holmes pointed to another man, not me. \\"Our representative from Jeonseongguk wanted it, but we should give the opportunity to the person who raised their hand first, right?\\" [To be fair, you should have chosen me, Ashley.] I looked at the man Ashley Holmes pointed to. Tall with an exotic appearance. [A man who ends up being dumped after taking care of Ashley Holmes.] \\"Could you tell us who you are and where you're from?\\" Ashley Holmes acted naturally. [What, I know everything about you two.] But I kept my mouth shut and watched the two perform. \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> from GK Investment.\\" \\"John, could you come forward then?\\" \\"Yes.\\" John Kahn stepped forward and rolled up his sleeves. At this moment, Ashley Holmes began to act flustered. \\"Oh my... I came here because of a sudden question today, but I didn't bring any medical staff to this party to draw blood. I could do it, but for the sake of the experiment's fairness, it shouldn't be in such an impromptu setting but rather with medical staff present.\\" [Slipping away like an eel...] I raised my hand again. Ashley Holmes slightly frowned and pointed at me. \\"Our representative from Jeonseongguk is really curious.\\" \\"From what you've said, isn't 'Thomas' something any consumer can buy from any pharmacy and test?\\" \\"That's correct.\\" \\"Then, wouldn't it make more sense to test it in the current situation, aligning more with the purpose of 'Thomas'?\\" The crowd began to murmur. Ashley Holmes rolled her big eyes a few times as if searching for an answer, then looked at me. \\"Of course, that's the purpose of 'Thomas'. But it seems I haven't mentioned this point. Our Bloodtherapy is still unstable but is a company waiting to be perfected through investment.\\" \\"So, being able to test for over 250 diseases isn't true yet?\\" \\"It will be in the future. Of course, that requires research and manpower.\\" Ashley Holmes avoided my gaze as if she didn't want to take any more questions and looked at the people. \\"I'm sure there are those among you who can't trust the uncertain results yet. Naturally, Bloodtherapy's 'Thomas' is still unstable. But with your faith and investment, I promise a future where this kit will be sold across America in a few years.\\" Applause erupted at Ashley Holmes's words. I glanced at Jeon Taeguk. Jeon Taeguk was also clapping enthusiastically. Mark whispered to me. \\"Seongguk, in the end, they haven't achieved anything yet, right?\\" \\"That's right. 'Face Note' definitely had a substance, but 'Thomas' is practically nothing beyond that shoddy sample.\\" \\"Why are people so excited then?\\" \\"Because they want to believe. They want to believe in that woman's words that one kit can test for over 250 diseases.\\" I crossed my arms heavily. There was nothing more frightening than belief. Now, I had to shatter that belief. * * * Taeguk approached us with champagne. \\"Seongguk, Mark. Seeing all your faces here, what's going on?\\" \\"Taeguk, are you here to invest?\\" \\"Yeah. Very interested. You two as well?\\" \\"I came to eat.\\" Mark shook his head while eating a salmon roll. \\"Seongguk, are you interested?\\" \\"A bit. But brother, it's hard to believe without any results yet.\\" I leaked a bit of information. If Taeguk could realize from this information, then he had enough qualities as a businessman. \\"Hmm... Maybe it means there's a lot more work to be done? It sounds somewhat similar to the start of 'Face Note'. 'Face Note' also grew over time and is just starting to receive investments and grow.\\" \\"Taeguk, sorry, but comparing 'Face Note' and Bloodtherapy is a bit off. We have a substance, but they only have an idea published in a science journal without any clear results.\\" Mark was annoyed at comparing 'Face Note' to Bloodtherapy. \\"You might think that way because you're the founders of 'Face Note', but from an investor's perspective, they seem similar. Both have potential, but their futures are unconfirmed.\\" [Yeah, one's a flop, the other's a hit.] Annoyed by Taeguk's words, I gulped down some water. Moreover, Taeguk added without noticing the mood. \\"Honestly, 'Face Note' is too stiff, but Ashley Holmes is throwing parties like this to attract investors. Isn't it amazing?\\" \\"Taeguk, do you really like this party, barely held together with cheap caviar and champagne?\\" \\"It's a startup. When I see this, I think the company is trying hard for investors. Honestly, 'Face Note' always eats pizza.\\" [Jeon Taeguk! I'll make you regret saying that!] I gulped down more water. Jeon Taeguk patted my back. \\"Seongguk, don't get too heated. You can't always be first. You're just feeling like Ashley Holmes stole the spotlight, right?\\" \\"That's not it.\\" Jeon Taeguk smiled, lifting the corner of his mouth, and downed his champagne. \\"That's what everyone says.\\" Suddenly, I vaguely understood why Ashley Holmes called me. Ashley Holmes attracted investors' attention by inviting me and Mark, the founders of 'Face Note'. But even if my questions were all valid, a question thrown by a competing venture company's representative could easily be dismissed as mere jealousy. [Did I get played...] At that moment, Ashley Holmes approached with a smile. Jerry Chang was beside her. Ashley Holmes deliberately whispered in Jerry Chang's ear in front of Jeon Taeguk. [Is she trying to make him jealous? Don't tell me Taeguk is eyeing Ashley Holmes?] The moment I looked at Jeon Taeguk, I could see a determination in his eyes that I had never seen before. [Ah, what a headache. Please, put that effort into Samjeon Group!] I quickly pulled Mark. \\"Mark, let's go home. There doesn't seem to be anything more to see.\\" That's when it happened. Ashley Holmes approached me while looking at me. At the same time, Jerry Chang and Jeon Taeguk's gazes were fixed on me. Ashley Holmes pinched my cheek slightly. [Ashley, what are you trying to do? I'm not an easy man like Jeon Taeguk or Jerry Chang.] I brushed off Ashley's hand with a displeased tone. \\"Seongguk, thank you so much for coming all the way here. Your questions were so sharp, I was really surprised.\\" \\"I was just curious. Ashley, haven't you even gathered that much data yet? If you're starting like us, you should at least have that much data to start working with.\\" \\"The medical field requires long-term investment. Saving humanity isn't something that can be solved in a few years.\\" [Smooth talker...] \\"Saving humanity doesn't seem like something that can be achieved by just throwing parties.\\" \\"First, I have to do this even though it's not my style, to gather investments.\\" Mark also looked at Ashley Holmes aggressively. \\"Ashley, instilling the delusion that all venture companies gather investors through parties like this isn't a good idea.\\" \\"Ashley, are you not liking our party?\\" Ashley Holmes looked troubled, and whenever she did, the men's gazes towards us turned colder. I whispered to Mark. \\"Mark, it seems we're at a loss for staying here any longer. Let's leave.\\" Then I looked at Ashley Holmes. \\"Ashley, when can we see the performance of Bloodtherapy's 'Thomas' kit?\\" \\"We plan to invite people every week. Feel free to come anytime.\\" \\"I hope next time it won't just be talk, Ashley.\\" \\"Seongguk, why so scary? I appreciate you seeing me as a competitor, but there's no need to trample and crush your competition, right?\\" The men's gazes grew even colder, and Mark quickly pulled me away. \\"Seongguk, it seems we're only at a loss for staying here. Let's go.\\" Without responding to Ashley's last words, I left the party. * * * As we were leaving the party, a man caught my eye. John Kahn. The man who had competed with me by raising his hand earlier. Everyone at the party would think John Kahn came from GK Investment as he said. Of course, he might be with GK Investment now. But John Kahn's real identity is that he's in a romantic relationship with Ashley Holmes. At the same time, the money used to acquire this building and throw this party was actually all John Kahn's money. This was something I found out when I reinvestigated after being scammed by Ashley Holmes in my previous life. John Kahn looked a bit bitter as he watched Ashley Holmes surrounded by male investors from afar. I grabbed Mark's shoulder. \\"Mark, I'll talk to that guy and then go.\\" \\"Alright, Seongguk. I'll be outside getting some fresh air. It's too suffocating here.\\" \\"Okay.\\" I sent Mark off first and quietly approached John Kahn. \\"Hello. I was surprised earlier because you applied before me. I thought I was the first to raise my hand.\\" \\"Ah, you're the representative from 'Face Note', right?\\" \\"Yes, that's correct. Let me formally introduce myself. I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.\\" \\"I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. As I said earlier, I work at GK Investment.\\" John Kahn forced a smile. He seemed to dislike the situation. [Hmm... Should I provoke some jealousy...] I subtly pointed at Ashley Holmes. \\"Ashley Holmes's company seems to attract a lot of male investors. Maybe it's because Ashley Holmes is beautiful.\\" [Not my type of beauty.] But I covered the situation with my outstanding acting skills. John Kahn's brows slightly furrowed. \\"More than that, everyone sees the potential in Bloodtherapy.\\" \\"Of course, the idea of testing for over 250 diseases with one kit is cool. But there's already a machine by Siemens in Germany that does fewer tests. Wouldn't it be a better investment to invest in Siemens, which already has the technology, rather than Bloodtherapy?\\" \\"Hmm... Thanks for the new information.\\" John Kahn wasn't the type to easily reveal his inner thoughts. Then, it was time to drive the point home. \\"Anyway, be careful with that woman. I'm a minor, so if she gets too touchy with me, Ashley would be heading straight to jail.\\" \\"Did you fall for it?\\" \\"No. I'm a minor, remember? If she flirted with me, Ashley would be going to jail.\\" John Kahn's face hardened. \\"Just kidding! Forget everything I said. I was just jealous because a beautiful woman raised such a wonderful company.\\" \\"Seongguk, you're quite handsome yourself.\\" \\"Fortunately, 'Face Note' only has male investors who don't care about my face. Anyway, enjoy the party more. I have some work to do.\\" I took one last look at John Kahn's expression and left the party. John Kahn, regardless of my departure, stared intently at Ashley Holmes mingling with other investors. \\"Seongguk, what did you talk about with that John Kahn guy?\\" Mark, who had been taking a walk, approached with his hands in his pockets. \\"John Kahn is Ashley Holmes's accomplice. More like a lover...\\" \\"Seongguk, how did you know that?\\" \\"When she asked for a few drops of blood earlier. I definitely raised my hand first.\\" \\"So, they were in on it together?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" Mark looked surprised and turned back to look at the party. \\"Ashley is really a bad woman. So, what did you tell John Kahn?\\" \\"That Ashley flirts with male investors.\\" Mark stopped in his tracks, shocked. \\"Seongguk...\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"You're really...\\" \\"A bad guy?\\" \\"Yeah.\\" Mark nodded. \\"Mark, I'm only interested in winning.\\""},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[역시 피는 물보다 진한 거야….] * * * 애슐리 홈즈의 벤처 회사는 실리콘밸리에서도 가장 비싼 건물에 위치해 있었다. 마크가 의아한 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 블러드테라피는 요즘 막 투자받기 시작했다고 하지 않아?” “한국 속담에 이런 말이 있어. 빈 수레가 요란하다. 지금 애슐리 홈즈가 딱 그런 거 아닐까?” “성국, 잠깐.” “왜, 마크?” 마크는 나를 위아래로 훑더니, 셔츠 단추를 잠갔다. “마크, 뭐 하는 거야?” “성국, 이거 반칙이지. 셔츠 단추 세 개는 스무 살 넘으면 푸는 거야.” “나 미성년자잖아. 이런다고 여자들이 넘어올 리가 없어.” “미성년자니까 셔츠 단추는 한 개 이상 풀면 안 돼!” 나는 어쩔 수 없이 셔츠 단추 한 개만 풀고 애슐리 홈즈의 사무실로 들어갔다. * * * 애슐리 홈즈의 파티장은 저번에 열린 호텔 파티 부럽지 않은 모습이었다. 샴페인과 캐비어. 각종 핑거 푸드 역시 호텔에서 공수해 온 것 같았다. 마크는 얼른 샴페인을 집더니 핑거 푸드를 입에 넣고 투덜거렸다. “피자나 주지. 이런 거로는 배도 안 찬다고.” 나도 옆에 있는 캐비어를 집어서 먹었다. “흠….” 역시 빈 수레가 요란한 법이었다. 샴페인도, 캐비어도 구색만 맞춰놨을 뿐 싸구려였다. 애슐리 홈즈가 우리를 발견하고는 웃으며 다가왔다. 저번에 입은 것과 다른 블랙 드레스를 입고, 오늘은 공들여서 머리로 말끔하게 올렸다. “어머, 마크와 성국. 둘 다 또 보게 돼서 얼마나 기쁜지 모르겠어요.” “저희는 그저 편한 파티인 줄 알았는데, 생각보다 거창한데요.” “성국이랑 마크 외에도 오늘 중요한 투자자들이 오거든요. 내가 이따가 소개해 줄게요. 다들 장난 아닌 거물들이에요. 우리 회사에 투자할지도 몰라요.” 애슐리는 우리에게 그 거물 투자자를 보여주면서 자신의 사업이 얼마나 든든한지 홍보하려는 속내를 거침없이 드러냈다. [뭐, 제리 창 같은 찐따들이나 모았겠지.] 나는 빈속을 채우기 위해서 연어롤 하나를 입에 밀어 넣었다. 그때, 눈을 의심하게 만드는 인물이 한 명 등장했다. “성국, 저기 태국이 아니야?” 전태국이 거만한 얼굴로 걸어 들어오고 있었다. 애슐리 홈즈가 애교 섞인 웃음을 지으며 전태국에게 다가갔다. 그리곤 살짝 팔짱까지 끼고는 전태국에게 사무실을 안내하기 시작했다. [설마 블러드테라피에 투자할 거물이 전태국이야?] 나는 놀라서 잠시 그 자리에 우뚝 서서 전태국을 바라봤다. 물론 과거의 내가 했던 투자 실패에 비추어 본다면 전태국이 애슐리 홈즈의 사업에 관심을 기울이는 것은 당연했다. [삼전 그룹의 유전병 때문이겠지….] 마크가 놀라서 나를 잡았다. “설마 전태국이 여기 투자할 거란 말이야?” “전태국이라기보다는 삼전 그룹 차원에서 투자하겠지.” 대한민국에서 유일무이한 수저를 물고 태어났으니, 병 때문에 그 수저를 놓기 싫은 건 너무 당연한 일일 것이다. 나는 그래서 애슐리 홈즈가 더 싫었다. 애슐리 홈즈는 사람의 목숨을 가지고 사기를 쳤기 때문이다. 사람들의 절박함을 이용하는 사기야말로 악질 중에 악질이었다. 이때, 전태국이 나와 마크를 발견하고는 반갑게 손을 들었다. “성국! 마크!” 마크가 옆에서 중얼거렸다. “성국, 블러드테라피가 진짜 사기라면 태국이한테 귀띔이라도 해줘야 하는 거 아니야?” “…….” 나는 굳게 입을 다물었다. 그동안 글로벌 호구스럽게 우리에게 당해준 것을 생각하면 이 정도 정보쯤은 줄 수도 있다. 하지만 전태국에게 이 정보를 흘린다는 것은 곧 삼전 그룹이 움직인다는 말이었다. 작은 일이 커지게 되면 그 뒤에 내가 있다는 것까지 알려지게 된다. 그렇게 되면 애슐리 홈즈의 사기를 밝히기 전에 내가 곤란해질 수도 있었다. 나는 마크에게 속삭였다. “마크, 아직은 아니야. 태국이 형도 아마 아직 투자를 확정하진 않았을 거야. 분위기를 지켜본 후에 행동하자고.” “알았어.” 마크는 고개를 끄덕였다. * * * 파티장에는 내가 예상한 것보다 많은 사람이 모였다. 그들은 모두 애슐리 홈즈가 제공한 싸구려 샴페인을 마시며 무대에 선 애슐리 홈즈를 주목했다. 애슐리 홈즈는 자신이 개발한 혈액 진단 키드를 가지고 나와서 설명하기 시작했다. “여러분, 단 몇 방울의 피로 250 여 가지가 넘는 질병을 알아낼 수 있는 진단 키트를 약국에서 살 수 있다면 우리의 삶은 어떻게 변할까요?” “병원이 필요 없겠는데요!” 누군가 크게 소리쳤다. 애슐리 홈즈는 대답에 흡족한 표정을 짓고는 설명을 이었다. “그렇죠. 저희 블러드테라피가 원하는 것이 바로 그것입니다. 병원에 한 번 가려면 예약부터 시작해서 비용도 만만치 않게 깨지죠. 그런 여러 가지 절차와 비용 때문에 병을 키우는 사람들이 많습니다. 만약 제가 개발한 블러드테라피의 혈액 진단 키트인 ‘토마스’가 상용화된다면 블러드테라피는 얼마나 많은 사람을 구할 수 있을까요? 상상만 해도 행복한 미래가 바로 이 ‘토마스’에 있습니다.” 전태국은 마치 신을 보듯이 애슐리 홈즈를 바라보고 있었다. 나는 조용히 손을 들었다. 애슐리 홈즈는 나를 손으로 가리켰다. “어머, ‘페이스 노트’의 전성국 대표님이 여기 와 계시네요.” 그 말 한마디에 실내가 웅성거렸다. ‘페이스 노트’가 얼마나 투자자들 사이에서 이슈가 되는지 한 번에 알 수 있었고, 동시에 애슐리 홈즈는 우리의 인지도를 이용해서 블러드테라피를 홍보했다. “전성국 대표님, 뭐 질문이라도 있으세요?” “네. 궁금한 게 있어서요.” “편하게 물어보세요.” “지금 하신 말씀은 너무 좋은 것 같습니다. 저 역시 그런 혈액 키트가 있다면 당장 약국에 가서 살 거 같거든요. 그런데, 지금 말씀만 하셨지 혈액 진단 키트를 이용해서 그동안 얼마나 많은 질병을 밝혔는지 같은 연구 결과는 하나도 없네요. 그리고 지금 혈액 진단 키트는 임신 진단 키트와 모양도 비슷한데, 언제쯤 저희가 눈으로 그 키트로 질병을 밝혀내는 것을 직접 볼 수 있을까요?” 애슐리 홈즈는 큰 두 눈을 깜빡였다. 내 질문에 대답을 찾고 있는 게 뻔히 보였다. 나는 연달에 질문을 했다. “진단 키트가 있다면 그걸 분석하는 기계도 있어야 할 텐데, 그 기계는 지금 보이지 않네요.” 내 말에 사람들이 웅성거렸다. 애슐리 홈즈도 당황하는 게 보였다. [자, 애슐리. 말만 하지 말고, 진짜를 보여달라고!] 나는 팔짱을 끼고 애슐리 홈즈를 쳐다봤다. 애슐리 홈즈는 깊이 숨을 들이쉬고 뱉더니 입꼬리를 애써 올리며 웃었다. “조급하신 관객분이 계시네요. 이제부터 제가 보여드릴 것은 바로 이 키트를 통해 수집된 혈액을 분석해서 질병을 검사하는 기계입니다. 저는 이 아이를, 어머, 워낙 제가 공을 들이다보니 아이라는 말이 나오네요.” 애슐리 홈즈는 억지로 유머를 섞었지만, 좌중은 조용했다. 크게 숨을 쉰 애슐리 홈즈가 손뼉을 치자 뒤에서 직원 한 명이 복사기 같이 생긴 기계 하나를 끌고 나왔다. “자, 여러분. 이 기계가 바로 혈액 진단 키트를 분석해줄 저희 회사 이름을 그대로 딴 블러드테라피입니다. 그럼, 이 기계가 혈액 분석하는 모습을 알아보기 위해서 혹시 귀중한 피를 몇 방울 주실 분 계실까요?” 나는 다시 번쩍 손을 들었다. “저요!”","completion":"Episode 176 Mark showed me an office of \\"Face Note\\" with an excited face. \\"Seongguk, the view here is no joke. I saved this office for you.\\" As Mark said, the view was wide open, and the trees were visible at a glance. \\"It's much bigger than the studio in front of Harvard where we first started. I'll set up the desk and computer, everything as you want.\\" \\"Hmm... Mark, isn't this too big for me?\\" \\"What do you mean, too big? You're the co-CEO of 'Face Note'.\\" I scratched my temple. \\"Mark, I'd prefer a space where I can comfortably communicate with the staff and see my work. We've always used such offices.\\" \\"That's because it was just you and me. And Ms. Mimi, just the three of us.\\" \\"Back then, our communication was better than ever. Ms. Mimi would speak up if there was a problem, and then you'd take care of it. Sometimes we'd have meetings right on the spot.\\" \\"But... a company needs to have a system.\\" \\"Mark, we didn't start 'Face Note' to run a company like those stuffy adults.\\" \\"But still...\\" Mark scratched his curly hair. \\"Mark, when I said I wanted an office, I meant just a place to put my laptop and work.\\" \\"Is that what you meant?\\" \\"Yeah... And I always want to keep an eye on what you and Ms. Mimi are doing. To monitor if a workplace romance is spoiling the company atmosphere.\\" \\"Seongguk, are you really doing this?\\" \\"Just kidding.\\" Mark put his arm around my shoulder. \\"Seongguk, I know there's no joke in what you said. You're serious right now.\\" [Hmm, I've been caught.] I just smiled. \\"Look at you, just smiling. When things get ambiguous, you smile with that handsome face and get away with it, but you know that doesn't work on me, right?\\" \\"Mark, you've grown a lot.\\" \\"Seongguk, have I grown as much as you? When I first saw you, you were a little kid struggling to carry a bag! But now, you're much taller than me!\\" Mark reminisced about the past with a slight smile. Then, an alert from 'Face Note' rang for both me and Mark at the same time. \\"Who is it?\\" \\"It's obviously Ashley.\\" \\"Seongguk, you talk as if you're inside Ashley's head.\\" [Of course. I know that woman well...] In my previous life, when I was investing, I met that woman dozens of times in the United States and was deceived. After being deceived, I was so angry that I couldn't sleep and analyzed her. At the same time, I proceeded with dozens of lawsuits. Every time, that woman would come up with various excuses to delay the trial and provoke my anger. In this life, I can't let things go her way. I checked 'Face Note'. As expected! Ashley sent an invitation to a party of Bloodtherapy to both me and Mark through 'Face Note'. \\"Seongguk, what is this woman thinking? She doesn't even send us a friend request but invites us to a party.\\" \\"Mark, there's something you probably can't do unless you're reborn.\\" \\"What's that?\\" \\"It's called playing hard to get. It's a kind of tug-of-war mainly done between men and women to take control. Right now, Ashley is playing hard to get with us.\\" Mark still looked puzzled. \\"Why would she play hard to get with us? We're not in a relationship. Honestly, you're a minor, and I already have a girlfriend.\\" \\"Ashley just enjoys this. Even in business. Through this playing hard to get, once she confirms she's in a superior position, she'll try to control us like slaves.\\" \\"Seongguk, how old are you really? At times like this, you seem like you're the same age as Bill Gates or Charlie Jobs.\\" [Peers, right.] I quickly accepted Ashley's invitation. \\"Mark, you accept it too.\\" \\"Playing hard to get, right? Then, shouldn't we not accept and play hard to get?\\" \\"Mark, at first, we need to seem like we're falling for Ashley to approach her more easily.\\" \\"Is that so...\\" I put my arm around Mark's shoulder. \\"Mark, it seems like a miracle that you've dated.\\" \\"Seongguk, you're still a minor, but... from what I see, dating will be as hard for you as it is for me. When you're old enough to date, I'll coach you a lot as a senior in dating.\\" Mark shrugged his shoulders. \\"By the way, there's a dress code, this woman. What's with the suit at a party hosted by a venture company?\\" \\"Just wear the clothes we bought last time, what's the big deal.\\" \\"Seongguk, you're not buying me clothes this time?\\" Mark asked with a playful face. \\"Mark, I'm not rich enough to buy two luxury suits yet.\\" [At least until I make as much as the Samjeon Group's wealth, buying two luxury suits is nothing, Mark.] Thinking this, I felt like I was becoming more like my father. In my previous life, there wasn't a day I wore the same clothes, but in this life, no matter how much money I made, I felt like a miser. [Blood is thicker than water, after all...] * * * Ashley Holmes' venture company was located in one of the most expensive buildings in Silicon Valley. Mark looked at me with a puzzled face. \\"Seongguk, didn't you say Bloodtherapy just started getting investments?\\" \\"There's a Korean saying, 'An empty cart makes a lot of noise.' Maybe that's exactly what Ashley Holmes is doing?\\" \\"Seongguk, wait.\\" \\"Why, Mark?\\" Mark looked me up and down, then buttoned up my shirt. \\"Mark, what are you doing?\\" \\"Seongguk, this is cheating. You're supposed to unbutton three shirt buttons when you're over twenty.\\" \\"I'm a minor. There's no way girls would fall for this.\\" \\"Since you're a minor, you shouldn't unbutton more than one!\\" I reluctantly unbuttoned only one shirt button and entered Ashley Holmes' office. * * * Ashley Holmes' party venue was as impressive as a hotel party held previously. Champagne and caviar. Various finger foods also seemed to have been airlifted from a hotel. Mark quickly grabbed a champagne and stuffed finger food into his mouth, grumbling. \\"They should've given us pizza. This stuff doesn't fill you up.\\" I also picked up some caviar and ate it. \\"Hmm...\\" As expected, an empty cart makes a lot of noise. Both the champagne and caviar were just for show, cheap quality. Ashley Holmes spotted us and approached with a smile. \\"Oh, Mark and Seongguk. I'm so happy to see you both again.\\" \\"We thought it was just a casual party, but it's more grand than we thought.\\" \\"Besides Seongguk and Mark, important investors are coming today. I'll introduce you to them later. They're all big shots. They might invest in our company.\\" Ashley Holmes openly revealed her intention to use our recognition to promote Bloodtherapy. [Well, she must have gathered losers like Jerry Chang.] I stuffed a salmon roll into my mouth to fill my empty stomach. Then, a person appeared who made me doubt my eyes. \\"Seongguk, isn't that Taeguk over there?\\" Jeon Taeguk was walking in with a smug face. Ashley Holmes approached Jeon Taeguk with a coquettish smile, even linking arms slightly, and began to show him around the office. [Could the big shot investor for Bloodtherapy be Jeon Taeguk?] I was so surprised that I stood still for a moment and watched Jeon Taeguk. Considering my past investment failures, it was natural for Jeon Taeguk to be interested in Ashley Holmes' business. [It must be because of the genetic disease of the Samjeon Group...] Mark grabbed me in surprise. \\"Could Jeon Taeguk really be investing here?\\" \\"It's more like the Samjeon Group investing at a group level.\\" Being born with the only golden spoon in South Korea, it was too natural for him not to want to let go of that spoon because of a disease. That's why I hated Ashley Holmes even more. Ashley Holmes was committing fraud using people's lives. Fraud that exploits people's desperation is the worst kind of evil. Then, Jeon Taeguk spotted me and Mark and waved his hand happily. \\"Seongguk! Mark!\\" Mark muttered next to me. \\"Seongguk, if Bloodtherapy is really a scam, shouldn't we at least give Taeguk a heads-up?\\" \\"......\\" I kept my mouth shut. Considering the global fooling we've been subjected to so far, I could afford to give out this much information. But telling Jeon Taeguk this information meant that the Samjeon Group would move. If a small matter escalates, it could be revealed that I was behind it. Then, before exposing Ashley Holmes' scam, I could be in trouble. I whispered to Mark. \\"Mark, not yet. Taeguk hyung probably hasn't decided on the investment yet. Let's watch the situation and act later.\\" \\"Got it.\\" Mark nodded. * * * The party venue had more people than I expected. They all focused on Ashley Holmes, who stood on stage, drinking the cheap champagne she provided. Ashley Holmes began to explain the blood diagnostic kit she developed. \\"Ladies and gentlemen, imagine if you could buy a diagnostic kit at a pharmacy that can detect over 250 diseases with just a few drops of blood. How would our lives change?\\" \\"We wouldn't need hospitals!\\" Someone shouted loudly. Ashley Holmes looked pleased with the response and continued her explanation. \\"Right. That's exactly what Bloodtherapy wants. Going to the hospital involves everything from making an appointment to not insignificant costs. Many people end up worsening their conditions because of these various procedures and costs. If the Bloodtherapy blood diagnostic kit 'Thomas' I developed becomes commercialized, can you imagine how many people Bloodtherapy could save? The happy future is right here in this 'Thomas'.\\" Jeon Taeguk looked at Ashley Holmes as if he was looking at a deity. I quietly raised my hand. Ashley Holmes pointed at me. \\"Oh, Seongguk Jeon, the representative of 'Face Note', is here.\\" With that one sentence, the room buzzed. It was immediately clear how much of an issue 'Face Note' was among investors, and at the same time, Ashley Holmes used our recognition to promote Bloodtherapy. \\"Representative Jeon Seongguk, do you have a question?\\" \\"Yes, I have something I'm curious about.\\" \\"Please feel free to ask.\\" \\"Your words sound very promising. I, too, would rush to a pharmacy to buy such a blood kit. But, you've only talked about it, and there's no research result on how many diseases have been identified using the blood diagnostic kit so far. And the blood diagnostic kit looks similar to a pregnancy test kit, when can we actually see this kit identifying diseases with our own eyes?\\" Ashley Holmes blinked her big eyes. It was obvious she was looking for an answer to my question. I continued to ask. \\"If there's a diagnostic kit, there should also be a machine to analyze it, but I don't see that machine now.\\" My words caused a stir among the people. Ashley Holmes also looked flustered. [Now, Ashley. Show us the real thing, not just words!] I crossed my arms and looked at Ashley Holmes. Ashley Holmes took a deep breath and smiled, trying to lift the corners of her mouth. \\"It seems we have an impatient audience member. Now, what I'm going to show you is the machine that analyzes the blood collected through this kit to test for diseases. I've put so much effort into this, I accidentally called it my child.\\" Ashley Holmes forced humor into her words, but the audience was silent. After taking a deep breath, Ashley Holmes clapped her hands, and an employee dragged out a machine that looked like a copier. \\"Ladies and gentlemen, this machine is Bloodtherapy, named after our company, which will analyze the blood diagnostic kit. Now, to see how this machine analyzes blood, would anyone be willing to donate a few precious drops of blood?\\" I raised my hand again. \\"Me!\\""},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

[남자가 질투하기 시작하면 무섭다고.] 나는 빙긋 미소를 지었다. * * * 존 칸은 소파 앞을 오갔다. 소파에 앉은 애슐리 홈즈가 관자놀이에 손을 가져다 대며 피곤한 척 굴었다. “존, 난 이만 자러 갈게.” “애슐리… 나한테 거짓말하는 거 없어?” “무슨 소리야. 난 당신한테 거짓말하는 거 하나도 없어. 오늘따라 왜 이래? 나 오늘 너무 피곤해. 파티에, 투자자들 설득에. 모든 것을 내가 하고 있잖아.” 애슐리의 미간이 구겨지자 존 칸은 슬쩍 애슐리 눈치를 봤다. 그래도 이 말을 안 하고는 못 견딜 것 같았다. “아니… 애슐리, 이상하게 듣지 마.” “어서 말이나 해. 존, 난 이제 잠 좀 자고 싶어. 도대체 뭐가 불만이야?” “그게… 내 생각에는 애슐리가 투자자들한테 너무 다정하게 구는 거 같아서.” 애슐리는 그 말을 듣자마자 어이없다는 얼굴로 존을 바라봤다. “존, 블러드테라피에 투자한 사람들이니까 다정하게 구는 게 당연한 거잖아. 이런 걸로 쓸데없이 꼬투리 잡을 거면 우리 그만 헤어져.” 애슐리가 자리에서 일어나자 존은 얼른 애슐리의 어깨를 잡았다. “지금 나를 이용하고 버리겠다는 거야? 내가 블러드테라피에 쓴 돈이 얼마인 줄 알아!” “존… 지금 그까짓 돈으로 나를 옭아매는 거야?” “그, 그게 아니라….” 존은 당당한 애슐리의 태도에 조금 기가 죽었다. 애슐리는 그걸 눈치채고는 얼른 존을 다독였다. “존… 나는 블러드테라피가 자기랑 나랑 같이 이룬 회사라고 생각해. 하지만 지금은 시작 단계잖아. 그리고 투자자들은 스탠포드 출신의 금발인 나를 좋아할 게 뻔하잖아.” 애슐리는 존의 손을 잡았다. “존, 난 그저 비즈니스적으로 투자자들에게 친하게 대했을 뿐이야.” “아, 알았어.” “근데… 존. 오늘 갑자기 왜 이러는 거야? 혹시… 누구한테 무슨 이야기 들었어?” “그 동양의 남자애 있잖아. 잘생긴.” “성국?” “응. 암튼… 난 그냥 애슐리가 걱정돼서.” “그런 거라면 걱정하지 마. 우리 블러드테라피는 이제 시작이잖아.” “응.” 존 칸은 어느새 애슐리 홈즈에게 길들여져서 고개를 끄덕였다. “난, 이만 들어가서 잘게. 존, 다음 주에 있을 파티에서는 오늘처럼 구색만 맞춘 싸구려는 안 돼. 좀 더 파티를 크게 열었으면 하는데… 괜찮겠지?” “어… 내가 자금은 알아서 준비할게.” “고마워, 존.” 애슐리 홈즈는 들어가면서 누군가에게 메시지를 보냈다. - 우리 저녁이나 먹을까요? * * * 초인종이 시끄럽게 울렸다. 마크의 잔소리에 질려갈 때쯤이라 나는 얼른 인터폰을 확인했다. 인터폰에는 전태국의 얼굴이 대문짝만하게 보였다. 전태국이 날 구원해줄 줄이야. 나는 얼른 문을 열고, 격하게 전태국을 반겼다. “태국이 형, 어서 와요.” “성국, 무슨 일 있어? 왜 평소와 달리 이렇게 반기는 거지?” “아까 파티에서 간만에 봐서 더 반가운가 봐요.” 나는 애써 둘러댔다. “태국이 형, 근데 이 밤에 무슨 일이에요?” “아까 너랑 마크가 파티에서 사라져서 궁금해서….” 전태국도 조금의 눈치라는 게 있는 건가…. 나는 조심스럽게 접근했다. “태국이 형, 블러드테라피 어떻게 생각해요?” “흠… 어쨌든 모두가 원하는 것을 아는 기업이라고나 할까. 지금은 그 얘기 하려고 온 게 아니고….” 전태국은 나를 스킵하더니 마크에게 다가갔다. 그리곤 마크에게 진지하게 물었다. “마크, 미미 씨랑 연애할 때 마크가 먼저 대시한 거지?” “태국, 갑자기 그건 왜 묻는 거야?” “왜긴… 애슐리한테 내가 같이 저녁이나 먹자고 메시지를 보낼까 해서.” “태국, 애슐리한테 관심 있는 거야?” 마크는 놀라서 물렀다. 전태국은 특유의 거만한 표정으로 살짝 고개를 끄덕였다. “뭐, 결혼은 집에서 정해준 여자랑 하겠지만. 미국에 있는데, 좀 더 다양한 여자들을 만나도 좋을 것 같고 해서… 애슐리 정도의 유망한 사업가라면 아버지도 연애하는 건 눈감아 주실 것 같기도 하고….” 나는 뒤에서 고개를 절레절레 흔들었다. [전태국이 그럼 그렇지….] 마이너스 손의 가장 큰 문제점은 바로 감정에 연연해서 사업을 한다는 것이다. 지금 전태국은 애슐리 홈즈와 어떻게 해보려고 투자까지 하려는 멍청한 짓을 하고 있었다. 마크도 난감한 얼굴로 전태국을 쳐다봤다. “태국, 네가 애슐리에게 관심 있는 것은 알겠는데… 좀 더 사람을 알아보는 건 어때?” “무슨 소리야?” “그냥… 애슐리 그 여자 좀 너무 모두에게 친절하잖아. 모두에게 친절한 사람들은 항상 뭔가를 숨기는 경우가 많더라고.” 마크는 최대한 에둘러 말했다. 전태국은 이마를 긁적였다. “흠…. 네가 북조선 출신의 딱딱한 리미미 씨랑 사귀어서 그러는 거 아니야?” 이때, 리미미가 막 집에 들어왔다. “듣는 리미미 기분 나쁩니다, 전태국 씨.” “뭐, 들으라고 한 말은 아니에요. 오해하지 마세요. 근데 두 사람 사귀는 사이에 한집에서 사는 건 미성년자인 성국이한테 안 좋은 영향을 끼치는 거 아니에요?” “태국, 우리는 진짜 여전히 좋은 하우스메이트로 지내.” “마크, 그런 건 성국이한테 물어봐야지. 성국아, 넌 진짜 괜찮아?” “난 상관없어. 어차피 난 얼마 후에 한국 다시 들어가 봐야 하거든.” “한국에는 왜?” “설날이잖아요. 가족들 만나러 가야죠.” [그 전에 애슐리 홈즈를 박살 내고….] 이때, 핸드폰에 메시지 알람이 뜬 게 보였다. 누구지? 메시지를 확인하는 순간, 내 미간이 구겨졌다. 바로 애슐리 홈즈였다. - 우리 저녁이나 먹을까요? 나는 잠시 고민하다 메시지를 보냈다. - 피자 괜찮죠? 득달같이 답이 왔다. - 난 하와이안 피자를 사랑하거든요. [애슐리, 이런 수작은 태국이나 제리 같은 애들한테나 통하는 거야.] 애슐리 홈즈는 분명히 내 ‘페이스 노트’를 뒤져서 나에 대해서 알아본 게 틀림없었다. 태국이 메시지를 주고받는 나를 흘깃 쳐다봤다. “성국, 누구랑 이야기 중이야?” “애슐리 홈즈는 저한테 관심 있는 거 같은데요.” 나는 태국에게 애슐리 홈즈가 보낸 메시지를 보여줬다. [전태국, 내가 너에게 내려주는 마지막 동아줄이야. 잡든 말든 그건 네 자유야.] 전태국은 잔뜩 심각해진 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국, 그건 네 착각이야. 네가 미성년자인 거 애슐리 홈즈도 알잖아!” “알죠. 물론….” 나는 말을 삼갔다. “성국, 모두 널 좋아할 거란 거 말이야. 그거 순전히 네 착각이란 것을 밝혀주고야 말겠어!” 전태국은 괜히 심술을 부리고 자신의 집으로 돌아갔다. “성국, 내가 보기에 너 자꾸 전태국을 도발하는 것 같은데… 대체 왜 그러는 거야?” “저 집안사람들 내가 잘 알거든.” 전태국은 아마 지금 당장 애슐리 홈즈에게 사람을 붙여서 뒷조사를 시작할 것이다. 물론 시작은 애슐리 홈즈가 나에게 진짜 관심이 있는지 알아볼 요량이겠지만, 끝은 복잡한 애슐리 홈즈의 사생활을 알게 될 게 뻔하다. “근데 성국, 생각해보니까 나랑 미미 씨랑 한집에 사는 거 힘들지?” “둘만 괜찮다면. 난 하나도 안 힘들어.” [눈치는 둘이 보는 거겠지?] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. * * * 전태국은 양 비서에게 연락을 했다. 젊은 양 비서는 이제 일을 그만둔 후라, 젊은 양 비서의 아버지가 당분간 전태국의 일을 돌봤다. 곧 양 비서의 목소리가 들렸다. - 도련님, 어쩐 일이세요? “조사 하나만 좀 부탁드려요.” - 뭐든지요. “블러드테라피의 애슐리 홈즈라는 여자가 있는데요. 그 여자 사생활 좀 알아봐 주세요.” - 알겠습니다. 양 비서는 역시 이유 같은 것은 묻지 않았다. 이건 삼전 그룹의 불문율이었다. 로열패밀리가 시키면 하고, 이유는 묻지 않는다. 전태국은 성국과 마크의 말을 되새겼다. 만약 애슐리 홈즈가 자신을 유혹해서 투자를 유치하려고 한 것이라면 아주 끝까지 박살 내버릴 생각이었다. ‘감히 나, 삼전 그룹의 후계자 전태국을 가지고 놀아?’ * * * 저녁 7시. 나는 시간에 맞춰서 피자 가게로 나갔다. 애슐리 홈즈는 미리 나와서 하와이안 피자를 잔뜩 시켜놓고 있었다. 그리고 나를 향해서 손을 흔들었다. “성국, 어서 와.” “피자는 제가 사려고 했는데요.” “남자가 항상 사란 법이 어디 있어.” [당신한테 얻어먹기 싫어서 그러는 거야, 애슐리. 착각 좀 작작 해.] 하지만 지금 상황에서 돈을 건네는 것도 어색했다. 나는 피자를 먹으면서 애슐리의 진짜 목적을 기다렸다. 애슐리는 피자는 먹는 내내 자신이 얼마나 블러드테라피에 열정을 쏟고 있는지 이야기했다. 나는 피자를 세 조각 먹고, 콜라를 소리 나게 들이켰다. 그리고 애슐리를 쳐다봤다. “애슐리, 이제 그런 쓸데없는 이야기는 그만하고. 오늘 보자고 한 진짜 목적을 말해줬으면 좋겠어요.” [난 당신의 친절에 넘어가는 남자들이랑은 다르다고.] 나는 냅킨에 손을 닦았다. 그러자 애슐리는 이를 보이며 광고 모델처럼 웃었다. “성국, 대체 존에게 그런 말을 해서 얻는 게 뭐야? 나한테 라이벌 의식을 느끼는 거야?” “난 사기꾼한테 라이벌 의식을 느끼진 않아요, 애슐리.” 애슐리 홈즈의 파란 눈이 차갑게 변했다. “애슐리, 날 이용해서 빌 게이트와 찰리 잡스를 잡으려는 거 다 알아요.” “이제 필요 없어. 제리 창이 나에게 엄청난 투자를 했거든.” 제리 창은 야호에서 물러나긴 했지만, 야호의 지분과 그동안 한 투자가 제법 성공적이어서 꽤 많은 자금을 보유하고 있을 것이다. “애슐리. 그럴 땐 나에게 투자했다고 하지 않고, 블러드테라피에 한 거라고 보통 말하죠.” “그게 그거지.” [그래? 그렇다면 블러드테라피가 망하면 너도 망하는 거겠지, 애슐리?] 와그작. 와그작. 나는 얼음을 다 깨물어 목으로 넘겼다. 때마침 피자 가게에 있는 작은 텔레비전에서 저녁 뉴스가 나왔다. - GK 투자사의 존 칸이 회사 자금을 횡령한 혐의로 조사에 들어갔습니다. 더 놀라운 사실은 존 칸이 블러드테라피의 창업자로 제2의 찰리 잡스로 불리는 애슐리 홈즈와 연인 관계라는 사실입니다. 애슐리 홈즈와 존 칸이 같은 집에서 나오고 들어가는 모습이 찍힌 사진들이 연이어 나왔다. [역시 삼전의 정보력은 대단해…. 그렇다고 해도 이걸 이렇게 빨리 공개할 줄이야. 역시 전태국은 호구라니까.] 애슐리 홈즈는 순간 말을 잃고 뉴스를 바라봤다. 나는 애슐리 홈즈의 크고 파란 눈을 차갑게 쳐다봤다. [애슐리, 사람의 생명을 담보로 사기를 치면 되겠어?]","completion":"Episode 178 Mark's nagging continued even after coming home. \\"Seongguk, honestly, you don't know whether that person called John Khan is really in that kind of relationship with Ashley Holmes or not!\\" [Ah, how do I say that I definitely know this. I can't say it's something I investigated in my past life...] Mark paced back and forth in the middle of the living room. \\"Honestly, Seongguk. Seongguk, are you listening to me?\\" \\"Uh... I'm listening well.\\" In fact, I was half ignoring him. \\"Seongguk, I think we might have been too sensitive about Ashley Holmes.\\" \\"Mark, you were the one who liked the whole 007 thing. Think about it logically. Do you think Ashley Holmes' words make sense?\\" \\"That's why I agreed with you. Although a science magazine said that a few drops of blood could test for over 250 diseases, that part was the most suspicious. If you listen to Ashley Holmes, everything seems possible in the future. It was like today. It's not now, but it will be in the future. It's like a six-year-old saying they'll become the President of the United States when they grow up.\\" [Mark is not ordinary either!] I nodded my head. \\"Mark, exactly. If you're going to talk about the future, you should at least show some facts. But Ashley Holmes just comes out with a shoddy diagnostic kit and a blood analysis machine called blood therapy, just getting by. Honestly, I'm quite skeptical about whether the data is accurate.\\" \\"That's true but...\\" Mark looked at me again. \\"Still, wasn't it too far-fetched to say that John Khan is Ashley Holmes' lover?\\" \\"Mark, just wait and see.\\" I crossed my arms. It's unknown now, but it will become a known fact to everyone. And what's clear is that Ashley Holmes and John Khan are going to have a huge fight. [Men start to get scary when they become jealous.] I smiled slightly. * * * John Khan paced in front of the sofa. Ashley Holmes, sitting on the sofa, brought her hand to her temple, pretending to be tired. \\"John, I'm going to sleep now.\\" \\"Ashley... Are you lying to me?\\" \\"What are you talking about? I'm not lying to you at all. Why are you like this today? I'm really tired today. With the party, convincing investors. I'm doing everything.\\" As Ashley's brow furrowed, John Khan glanced at Ashley. Still, he felt he couldn't bear it without saying this. \\"Don't take it weirdly... Ashley.\\" \\"Just say it. John, I want to sleep now. What's bothering you?\\" \\"It's... I think Ashley is being too friendly to the investors.\\" Upon hearing that, Ashley looked at John with a face of disbelief. \\"John, they're investors in blood therapy, so it's natural for me to be friendly. If you're going to nitpick over such things, we should just break up.\\" As Ashley stood up, John quickly grabbed her shoulder. \\"Are you saying you're going to use me and then dump me? Do you know how much money I've put into blood therapy!\\" \\"John... Are you trying to tie me down with that measly money?\\" \\"That's not what I...\\" John's confidence waned a bit in front of Ashley's assertive attitude. Ashley noticed this and quickly soothed John. \\"John... I think of blood therapy as a company we've built together. But it's just the beginning. And the investors, being Stanford graduates, are bound to like a blonde like me.\\" Ashley held John's hand. \\"John, I was just being friendly to the investors for business.\\" \\"Ah, okay.\\" \\"But... John. Why are you acting like this all of a sudden? Did someone say something to you?\\" \\"That Asian guy. The handsome one.\\" \\"Seongguk?\\" \\"Yeah. Anyway... I'm just worried about Ashley.\\" \\"If that's the case, don't worry. Blood therapy is just starting.\\" \\"Yeah.\\" John Khan was eventually tamed by Ashley Holmes and nodded. \\"I'm going to go in and sleep. John, at the party next week, don't bring cheap stuff just to fill the space. I hope we can have a bigger party... Is that okay?\\" \\"Uh... I'll take care of the funding.\\" \\"Thanks, John.\\" <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> sent a message to someone as she went in. - Shall we have dinner? * * * The doorbell rang loudly. Just when I was getting tired of Mark's nagging, I quickly checked the intercom. Jeon Taeguk's face was as big as a door on the intercom. Jeon Taeguk came to my rescue. I quickly opened the door and warmly welcomed Jeon Taeguk. \\"Taeguk hyung, welcome.\\" \\"Seongguk, what's up? Why are you welcoming me differently than usual?\\" \\"Maybe because I saw you at the party after a long time, I'm happier.\\" I awkwardly made an excuse. \\"Taeguk hyung, but what brings you here at this hour?\\" \\"I was curious because you and Mark disappeared from the party...\\" Jeon Taeguk also had a bit of tact... I cautiously approached. \\"Taeguk hyung, what do you think about blood therapy?\\" \\"Hmm... Anyway, it's a company that knows what everyone wants. But I didn't come here to talk about that...\\" Jeon Taeguk skipped me and approached Mark. Then he asked Mark seriously. \\"Mark, when you were dating Mimi, you made the first move, right?\\" \\"Taeguk, why are you asking that all of a sudden?\\" \\"Why... I was thinking of sending a message to Ashley to have dinner together.\\" \\"Taeguk, are you interested in Ashley?\\" Mark asked in surprise. Jeon Taeguk slightly nodded with his characteristic arrogant expression. \\"Well, I'll marry the woman my family chooses, but since I'm in the US, I thought it would be nice to meet more diverse women... If it's a promising businesswoman like Ashley, my father might turn a blind eye to dating...\\" I shook my head from behind. [That's so like Jeon Taeguk...] The biggest problem with the minus hand is that they do business emotionally. Right now, Jeon Taeguk was about to make the foolish mistake of trying to invest just to get involved with Ashley Holmes. Mark looked at Jeon Taeguk with a troubled face. \\"Taeguk, I understand you're interested in Ashley, but... How about getting to know people better?\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"Just... Ashley is too friendly to everyone. People who are friendly to everyone often hide something.\\" Mark tried to beat around the bush as much as possible. Jeon Taeguk scratched his forehead. \\"Hmm... Is it because you're dating the stiff North Korean, Limimi?\\" Right then, Limimi just entered the house. \\"Listening Limimi is upset, Jeon Taeguk.\\" \\"Well, I didn't mean for you to hear that. Don't misunderstand. But isn't it a bad influence on the minor Seongguk for two people dating to live in the same house?\\" \\"Taeguk, we're really just living as good housemates.\\" \\"Mark, you should ask Seongguk about that. Seongguk, are you really okay?\\" \\"I don't mind. Anyway, I have to go back to Korea soon.\\" \\"Why Korea?\\" \\"It's Lunar New Year. I have to see my family.\\" [Before that, I'll smash Ashley Holmes...] Just then, a message notification appeared on my phone. Who is it? The moment I checked the message, my brow furrowed. It was Ashley Holmes. - Shall we have dinner? I hesitated for a moment before sending a message. - Is pizza okay? The reply came eagerly. - I love Hawaiian pizza. [Ashley, such tricks might work on guys like Taeguk or Jerry.] Ashley Holmes must have definitely snooped through my \\"Face Note\\" to find out about me. Taeguk glanced at me exchanging messages with Ashley Holmes. \\"Seongguk, who are you talking to?\\" \\"Ashley Holmes seems interested in me.\\" I showed Taeguk the message Ashley Holmes sent. [Jeon Taeguk, this is the last lifeline I'm giving you. Whether you grab it or not is up to you.] Jeon Taeguk looked at me with a very serious face. \\"Seongguk, you're mistaken. Ashley Holmes knows you're a minor!\\" \\"I know. Of course...\\" I trailed off. \\"Seongguk, everyone will like you. I'll prove that your misunderstanding is just that!\\" Jeon Taeguk left in a huff, heading back to his house. \\"Seongguk, from what I see, you keep provoking Jeon Taeguk... Why?\\" \\"I know that family well.\\" Jeon Taeguk would probably immediately have someone investigate Ashley Holmes' background. Of course, the start might be to find out if Ashley Holmes is genuinely interested in me, but the end will surely reveal the complicated personal life of Ashley Holmes. \\"But Seongguk, thinking about it, isn't it hard for me and Mimi to live in the same house?\\" \\"If you two are okay with it. I'm not troubled at all.\\" [The tact is for the two of you to see, right?] I shrugged. * * * Jeon Taeguk contacted Secretary Yang. The young Secretary Yang had retired from work, so for the time being, Secretary Yang's father took care of Jeon Taeguk's work. Soon, Secretary Yang's voice was heard. - Young master, what can I do for you? \\"Just a favor.\\" - Anything. \\"There's a woman named Ashley Holmes from Blood Therapy. Could you look into her personal life?\\" - Understood. Secretary Yang, as always, did not ask for a reason. This was an unwritten rule of the Samjeon Group. If the royal family asks, do it, and don't ask why. Jeon Taeguk pondered over Seongguk and Mark's words. If Ashley Holmes was trying to seduce him for investment, he was ready to crush her completely. 'Dare to play with me, Jeon Taeguk, the heir of Samjeon Group?' * * * 7 PM. I went out to the pizza shop on time. Ashley Holmes had already arrived and ordered a lot of Hawaiian pizza. And she waved at me. \\"Seongguk, welcome.\\" \\"I was going to pay for the pizza.\\" \\"Who said men always have to pay.\\" [Because I don't want to take advantage of you, Ashley. Stop misunderstanding.] But it was awkward to hand over money in this situation. While eating pizza, I waited for Ashley's real purpose. Throughout the meal, Ashley talked about how much passion she was pouring into Blood Therapy. I ate three slices of pizza and gulped down cola loudly. Then I looked at Ashley. \\"Ashley, let's stop with these pointless stories. I wish you'd tell me the real reason you wanted to meet today.\\" [I'm different from the men who fall for your kindness.] I wiped my hands with a napkin. Then Ashley showed her teeth and smiled like an advertisement model. \\"Seongguk, what do you gain by saying such things to John? Are you feeling competitive towards me?\\" \\"I don't feel competitive towards a scammer, Ashley.\\" Ashley Holmes' blue eyes turned cold. \\"Ashley, I know you're trying to use me to catch Bill Gates and Charlie Jobs.\\" \\"I don't need it anymore. Jerry Chang has made a huge investment in me.\\" Jerry Chang, although he had stepped down from Yahoo, had a considerable amount of funds from Yahoo's shares and his successful investments. \\"Ashley. Normally, you don't say he invested in me, but in Blood Therapy.\\" \\"That's the same thing.\\" [Really? Then if Blood Therapy fails, you'll fail too, right, Ashley?] Crunch. Crunch. I chewed the ice and swallowed it. Just then, the small television in the pizza shop showed the evening news. - GK Investment's John Khan is under investigation for embezzling company funds. More surprisingly, it has been revealed that John Khan is in a romantic relationship with Ashley Holmes, the founder of Blood Therapy, who is called the second Charlie Jobs. Photos of Ashley Holmes and John Khan entering and leaving the same house were shown in succession. [As expected, Samjeon's intelligence is amazing... But to disclose this so quickly. As expected, Jeon Taeguk is a fool.] Ashley Holmes was momentarily speechless and watched the news. I coldly looked into Ashley Holmes' big blue eyes. [Ashley, did you think you could scam using people's lives as collateral?]"},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

[뭐야, 다들 밥 먹으러 나갔나….] 나는 사온 피자 박스를 테이블에 올려놓고 냉장고 문을 열었다. 그리고 우유를 꺼냈다. 그리고 혼자 우유를 쭉 들이켰다. 순간 외로움이 쏟아졌다. 저번 생에서는 혼자 지내는 것이 무척 익숙했다. 이보다 더 큰 집에서 유학 생활을 했고, 결혼도 그렇게 일찍 한 편은 아니었다. 결혼하고도 일 년에 반 정도는 출장 등으로 가족과 함께일 때보다는 혼자일 때가 많았다. [마크도 연애하니까… 이제 나도 슬슬 혼자 살 준비를 해야 하겠지….] 달칵. 뒤에서 문 열리는 소리가 들리더니 마크와 리미미가 장을 잔뜩 봐서 들어오고 있었다. “성국, 언제 들어온 거야?” “지금 막. 두 사람 어디 다녀와?” “뉴스 봤어. 아무래도 너 피자도 제대로 못 먹고 들어올 것 같아서 미미 씨랑 저녁 만들어 먹으려고 장 좀 봤어.” “나 밥 못 먹었을까 봐?” 순간, 심장이 울컥했다. [마크… 리미미 씨….] 마크가 테이블 위에 있는 피자 박스를 보곤 실망한 기색이었다. “피자 사 왔어? 애슐리 만나긴 한 거야?” “응. 애슐리랑 피자 먹고 나오는데, 두 사람 생각나서 요 앞 피자집에서 사 왔어.” 나는 애써 울컥한 심장을 가라앉혔다. 마크는 피식 웃으며 장 본 것들을 냉장고에 집어넣었다. “성국아, 근데 존 칸이 횡령한 건 누가 밝혀낸 걸까?” “그거야 보나 마나 태국이 형이지.” “진짜?” “마크, 삼전 그룹의 정보력을 우습게 보면 안 돼. 삼전 그룹은 세계에서도 손꼽히는 기업이잖아.” “난 우습게 본 게 아니라… 내가 모르는 세상이니까. 와… 재벌들은 정말 우리랑 다른 세상 사람들이네.” 마크는 혀를 내둘렀다. [마크, 우리도 곧 그런 정보력을 가져야 할 거야. 미래는 정보가 바로 경쟁력이라고.] 이때, 초인종이 울렸다. 안 봐도 누군지 뻔했다. 마크도 아는 눈치였다. “성국, 호랑이도 제 말 하면 온다는 게 한국 속담 맞지?” “마크, 그 속담 리미미 씨가 가르쳐준 거야?” “응. 우리가 꼭 네 이야기하면 네가 나타나더라고. 그때 미미 씨가 알려준 거야.” 내가 리미미를 쳐다보자 리미미는 괜히 시선을 피했다. “피자엔 콜라인데. 콜라는 안 사 왔어요, 사장님?” “리미미 씨, 괜히 말 돌리지 말고요.” “사장님, 험담 안 했어요. 그냥 타이밍이 매번 그랬다고요. 아시다시피 저 사장님한테 절대 충성하고 있습니다.” 달칵. 문이 열리면서 전태국이 들어섰다. 마크가 반갑게 전태국을 맞았다. “태국, 저녁 먹었어?” “아직.” “성국이가 피자 사 왔어. 같이 먹자.” 전태국은 무거운 얼굴로 나를 쳐다봤다. “난 성국이랑 잠시 할 이야기가 있어서….” “형, 테라스에서 이야기할까요?” “그래.” 분명 애슐리 홈즈의 진실을 알게 된 건 좋은 일인데, 전태국의 표정과 말투는 전혀 그렇지 못했다. * * * 테라스로 나온 전태국의 손에는 맥주병이 들려있었다. 전태국은 맥주를 한입 벌컥 마셨다. “형, 무슨 일 있어요?” [전태국, 축배 드는 거지?] 순간 전태국의 눈이 촉촉해지는 것이 보였다. “성국… 나 정말 바보인가 봐.” [그걸 이제 안 거야, 전태국?] “형, 무슨 일이에요?” “난 애슐리 홈즈가 나한테 친절해서 진짜 나한테 관심 있는 줄 알았거든. 근데 결국… 삼전 그룹의 돈에 관심 있었던 거잖아.” [전태국, 넌 돈 빼면 시체인데. 그걸 모를 나이는 아닐 텐데….] 나는 어깨를 아주 살짝 으쓱했다. “애슐리 홈즈, 태국이 형이 조사한 거 맞죠?” “응. 내가 양 비서 시켜서 조사했어.” “뉴스도 발 빠르게 내보내고요?” “응… 아마 한 달 내로 애슐리 홈즈랑 블러드테라피는 무너질 거야. 더 빠를 수도 있고….” 역시 삼전 그룹은 내가 생각한 것보다 블러드테라피에 대해서 더 많이 알아낸 것 같았다. “형, 어쨌든 투자를 안 한 건 정말 잘한 거예요….” “그래… 회삿돈은 안 썼으니까.” [이 뉘앙스 뭐지?] 나는 은근히 전태국에게 물었다. “형, 애슐리 홈즈한테 개인적으로 투자했어요?” “개인적인 투자는 아니고… 저번에 애슐리가 밥 먹자고 해서… 난 잔뜩 기대를 또 해서… 그냥 아주 작은 다이아몬드 반지 하나 선물해줬어.” [뭐, 놀랍지도 않네.] 저번 생에서 전태국이 여배우들에게 쓴 돈 생각하면 다이아몬드 반지는 애교 수준이었다. “형, 앞으로는 쉽게 선물해주고 그러지 마요.” “여자들은 왜 내 돈만 보는 걸까….” [그거야, 돈밖에 볼 게 없으니까 그렇지.] “형, 할 이야기가 그거예요?” “그건 아니고… 아버지가 이 사실을 아셨어.” 전태국이 난감해한 이유는 따로 있었다. 양 비서를 통해서 조사를 하면 어쨌든 전재형 회장의 라인들이 움직일 수밖에 없다. 그렇다면 전태국이 애슐리 홈즈에게 다이아몬드 반지를 선물하고 투자까지 하려고 한 사실이 전재형 회장의 귀에 들어간 게 뻔했다. “형, 회장님이 이 일에 대해서 뭐라고 하세요?” “당장 한국으로 들어오래….” “가시면 되잖아요.” “성국아, 나 우리 아버지한테 엄청 혼날 거 같거든. 너도 이번 설에 한국 들어간다고 했잖아.” “네, 형.” “나랑 같이 들어가서… 아버지랑 같이 밥 좀 먹으면 안 될까?” “네에?” [전태국, 그건 아니지.] 전태국은 내 손까지 잡고 간청했다. “성국아, 제발 내가 부탁할게. 아버지는 나 귀국하고 다음 날부터 해외 출장 잡혀 계시거든. 첫날만 어떻게든 피하면 돼. 아버지가 귀국하자마자 밥 먹자고 하시는데, 나 무서워서 죽을 것 같아. 성국아, 그래도 네가 있으면 막 혼내시진 않을 거야.” “형, 혼날 일은 혼나야죠.” “넌 꼭 우리 아버지처럼 말을 하니… 내가 이렇게 부탁하는데, 안 되겠니? 응?” “대신 조건이 있어요.” 전태국의 얼굴이 살짝 펴졌다. “뭔데? 내가 할 수 있는 건 다 도와줄게.” “앞으로 기업 운영하다 보면 저 역시 애슐리 홈즈 같은 사람을 만나지 말란 법이 없거든요.” “그렇지….” 전태국은 내 말에 적절하게 추임새도 넣었다. 그만큼 간절한 모양이었다. “솔직히 이번에 굉장히 놀랐어요. 삼전 그룹의 정보력과 파급력이 어느 정도인지 확인했거든요.” “애슐리 홈즈가 너한테 보낸 메시지 보고 정신이 바짝 들더라고. 그 여자 완전 선수잖아. 나한테 다이아몬드 반지까지 받아놓고 너한테 또 그런 메시지를 보낸 거잖아. 내가 그래서 삼전 그룹의 정보 라인 좀 이용했지.” “그 정보 라인이요.” “그게 왜?” “제가 필요할 때 이용할 수 있게 형이 좀 도와주세요. 그러면 형이랑 같이 귀국해서 전재형 회장님 만나러 같이 갈게요.” 순간, 전태국이 나를 와락 안았다. “성국아! 역시 너밖에 없어.” [전태국, 지금 넌 나한테 또 호구 잡힌 거야.] 하지만 난 태연하게 한 손으로 전태국의 등도 두드려줬다. “형, 별말을요. 저도 형을 도울 일이 있어서 아주 기뻐요.” * * * 일주일 동안 온갖 뉴스는 온통 애슐리 홈즈가 장식했다. 처음 며칠은 GK 투자사의 존 칸의 횡령이 결국, 애인인 애슐리 홈즈의 기업인 블러드테라피를 돕기 위한 것이었단 사실에 초점이 맞춰줬다. 황색 언론들은 나이 차가 많이 나는 두 커플이 만나게 된 계기부터 시작해서 결혼 경력이 있는 존 칸의 과거까지 들쑤셨다. 애슐리 홈즈가 나이 많은 존 칸에게 끌린 이유를 어릴 적 부모님의 이혼에서 찾으며 각종 말도 안 되는 심리학자들이 나와서 애슐리 홈즈의 심리를 분석하기도 했다. 그러다 살짝 여론이 애슐리 홈즈 쪽으로 돌아서기도 했다. - 애슐리는 사실 사회 경험이 많은 존 칸에게 가스라이팅 당한 거라고 볼 수 있어요. 어쩌면 존 칸이 블러드테라피를 통해서 사기를 치기 위해서 금발에 미녀인 애슐리 홈즈를 내세운 것일 수도 있죠. 애슐리 홈즈는 누가 봐도 사랑스럽잖아요. 아침 뉴스쇼에서는 이런 말도 안 되는 추측까지 해댔다. 여론이 애슐리 홈즈 쪽으로 기울자 이에 울분을 느낀 존 칸이 드디어 공개적으로 블러드테라피의 진실을 공개했다. - 이건 애슐리 홈즈가 혈액 진단 키트인 ‘토마스’를 분석할 수 있다고 광고한 블러드테라피라는 혈액 분석 기계입니다. 하지만 이 기계는 사실 독일 지멘수 사의 혈액 분석 기계였습니다. 지금부터 애슐리 홈즈의 블러드테라피와 독일 지멘수 사의 혈액 분석 기계를 비교해보도록 하겠습니다. 뉴스의 기자는 독일 지멘수 사의 마크를 제거하고 그 위에 블러드테라피라고 적힌 스티커를 붙인 애슐리 홈즈의 기계가 독일 지멘수 사의 기계와 동일하다는 분석 결과를 보여주기도 했다. 결국, 애슐리 홈즈의 블러드테라피는 문을 닫았고, 애슐리 홈즈는 각종 소송에 휩싸였다. 그 이후에도 애슐로 홈즈에 대한 기사는 끊이지 않았다. * * * 나와 전태국은 퍼스트클래스 라운지에 앉아서 뉴스를 봤다. 전태국은 애슐리 홈즈의 뉴스가 나올 때마다 괜히 위스키만 마셔댔다. 이때, 전태국의 눈이 커지는 뉴스 하나가 나왔다. - 야호의 창업자인 제리 창마저 애슐리 홈즈에게 넘어가 거액을 투자한 것으로 알려져서 애슐리 홈즈 사건은 장기전으로 돌입할 것으로 보입니다. 그리고 한국의 삼전 그룹의 후계자인 전 모 씨는 애슐리 홈즈에게 개인적으로 3억 원이 넘는 다이아몬드 반지를 선물했다고 합니다. “안돼!” 전태국은 자신도 모르게 자리에서 벌떡 일어나더니 비명을 질렀다. 아무래도 삼전 그룹도 이 가십까지는 뉴스에 나가는 것을 막을 수는 없었던 모양이다.","completion":"Episode 179 I got up from my seat, leaving Ashley bewildered. Ashley, trying to compose herself, rubbed her cheeks a few times with her hands and looked up at me. \\"Sungguk, could it be that you…?\\" She asked, but her tone was uncertain. Of course, this incident wasn't my doing. \\"Ashley… I'm just a startup founder who's just started. I don't have the capability to escalate things to this level. You know that, right?\\" \\"Then, who on earth did this to me?\\" \\"Think about it, if there was anyone who bore a grudge against you, now would be a good time to reflect on it.\\" I left the pizza money on the table. \\"I'll pay for the pizza I ate. Ashley, if you have money to buy champagne or caviar for investors, use it for research.\\" \\"Sungguk, do you think I'm going to collapse like this?\\" [Probably… since you've messed with Samjeon, it's going to be tough to stay safe.] I left the pizza place without another word. The cool evening air greeted me. Ashley Holmes. Perhaps, in the future, people will remember her as a scammer. It's fortunate that her true nature was revealed sooner in this life, reducing the number of victims. Ashley Holmes used the 'Thomas' blood diagnostic kit to receive investments, conducting blood tests of donors in conventional ways. She deceived investors by claiming those results were obtained using 'Thomas'. Had Ashley Holmes' blood diagnostic kit been marketed, instead of people learning about their diseases earlier, they would have passed by without knowing their conditions. Now, the investigation into John Kahn's embezzlement has begun. Initially, John Kahn's embezzlement will be the issue, but soon, it will be revealed that the embezzled money was also funneled into Bloodtherapy. Ashley Holmes will likely deny her relationship with John Kahn while trying to save Bloodtherapy. But if I remember correctly, revealing that the machine used in Bloodtherapy is a blood analysis machine from the German company Siemens will bring an end to Ashley Holmes' national scam. * * * I entered the house with a pizza box in hand. All the lights were off. \\"Mark? Ms. Limimi?\\" But there was no response. [What, did everyone go out to eat…] I placed the pizza box on the table and opened the fridge. Then, I took out some milk. And drank the milk all by myself. Suddenly, I felt a wave of loneliness. In my previous life, I was quite accustomed to being alone. I studied abroad in a much bigger house, and I didn't marry particularly early. Even after getting married, I spent more than half of the year alone due to business trips, more than I spent with my family. [Since Mark is dating… I guess I should start preparing to live alone too…] Click. The sound of the door opening came from behind, and Mark and Limimi entered, having shopped a lot. \\"Sungguk, when did you get here?\\" \\"Just now. Where did you two go?\\" \\"We saw the news. We thought you might not have had a proper pizza, so Limimi and I decided to cook dinner, so we did some shopping.\\" \\"Thinking I might not have eaten?\\" My heart swelled at the moment. [Mark… Ms. Limimi…] Mark looked disappointed seeing the pizza box on the table. \\"Did you buy pizza? Did you meet Ashley?\\" \\"Yeah. I was coming back after eating pizza with Ashley, and I thought of you two, so I bought it from the pizza place nearby.\\" I tried to calm my overwhelmed heart. Mark chuckled and started putting the groceries in the fridge. \\"Sungguk, who uncovered John Kahn's embezzlement?\\" \\"That's obviously Brother Thailand.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Mark, don't underestimate the intelligence of the Samjeon Group. It's one of the top corporations in the world.\\" \\"I'm not underestimating it… It's just a world I don't know. Wow… The chaebols really live in a different world.\\" Mark clicked his tongue. [Mark, we'll soon need that kind of intelligence too. Information is the key to competitiveness in the future.] Then, the doorbell rang. I didn't need to see to know who it was. Mark seemed to know too. \\"Sungguk, there's a Korean saying that even a tiger comes when you talk about it, right?\\" \\"Mark, did Ms. Limimi teach you that saying?\\" \\"Yeah. Every time we talk about you, you show up. That's when Ms. Limimi told me.\\" As I looked at Limimi, she awkwardly avoided my gaze. \\"Shouldn't we have cola with pizza? Didn't you buy cola, boss?\\" \\"Ms. Limimi, don't try to change the subject.\\" \\"Boss, I didn't gossip. It's just that the timing always worked out like that. As you know, I'm absolutely loyal to you, boss.\\" Click. The door opened, and Jeon Taeguk entered. Mark greeted Taeguk warmly. \\"Taeguk, have you eaten dinner?\\" \\"Not yet.\\" \\"Sungguk brought pizza. Let's eat together.\\" Taeguk looked at me with a heavy expression. \\"I have something to discuss with Sungguk for a moment…\\" \\"Brother, shall we talk on the terrace?\\" \\"Okay.\\" Although discovering the truth about Ashley Holmes was a good thing, Taeguk's expression and tone were anything but. * * * Taeguk came out to the terrace with a beer bottle in his hand. He took a big gulp of beer. \\"Brother, what's wrong?\\" [Taeguk, are you proposing a toast?] Suddenly, Taeguk's eyes seemed to moisten. \\"Sungguk… I think I'm really a fool.\\" [You're just realizing that now, Taeguk?] \\"Brother, what happened?\\" \\"I thought Ashley Holmes was genuinely interested in me because she was kind to me. But in the end… she was only interested in the money of the Samjeon Group.\\" [Taeguk, without your money, you're just a corpse. You're not young enough not to know that…] I shrugged my shoulders slightly. \\"Ashley Holmes, did Brother Taeguk investigate her?\\" \\"Yes. I had Secretary Yang conduct the investigation.\\" \\"Did you also expedite the news release?\\" \\"Yes… Ashley Holmes and Bloodtherapy will collapse within a month. It could be sooner…\\" It seemed the Samjeon Group knew more about Bloodtherapy than I had thought. \\"Brother, not investing was really a good decision…\\" \\"Yeah… at least I didn't use the company's money.\\" [What's this nuance?] I subtly asked Taeguk. \\"Brother, did you personally invest in Ashley Holmes?\\" \\"It wasn't a personal investment, but… the last time Ashley asked me out for a meal… I was full of expectations again… and I just gifted her a small diamond ring.\\" [Well, not surprising.] Considering the money Taeguk spent on actresses in my previous life, a diamond ring was just a trifle. \\"Brother, don't give gifts so easily in the future.\\" \\"Why do women only see my money…\\" [Well, because there's nothing else to see.] \\"Brother, is that what you wanted to talk about?\\" \\"That's not it… Father found out about this.\\" The reason Taeguk was troubled was something else. If Secretary Yang conducted the investigation, then inevitably, Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's lines would have to move. Then, it was obvious that Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung would hear about Taeguk's intention to invest in Ashley Holmes and the gift of a diamond ring. \\"Brother, what did the chairman say about this?\\" \\"He told me to come back to Korea immediately…\\" \\"Just go.\\" \\"Sungguk, I'm really scared I'll be severely scolded by our father. You said you're going to Korea for the holidays, right?\\" \\"Yes, brother.\\" \\"Can you come with me and… have a meal with Father?\\" \\"What?\\" [Taeguk, that's not right.] Taeguk grabbed my hand and pleaded. \\"Sungguk, please, I'm begging you. Father will be back from his overseas trip the day after I return. If I can just avoid the first day, I'll be fine. Father wants to have a meal as soon as he returns, but I'm terrified. Sungguk, if you're there, he won't scold me too harshly.\\" \\"Brother, if you've done something wrong, you should be scolded.\\" \\"You sound just like our father… I'm begging you, can't you do it? Please?\\" \\"I have a condition.\\" Taeguk's face brightened slightly. \\"What is it? I'll help you with anything I can.\\" \\"Running a company, I might encounter someone like Ashley Holmes too.\\" \\"That's true…\\" Taeguk appropriately chimed in with my words, showing his desperation. \\"Honestly, I was shocked this time. I realized the extent of Samjeon Group's intelligence and influence.\\" \\"Seeing the message Ashley Holmes sent you really woke me up. That woman is a total player. She even got a diamond ring from me and sent you that message. That's why I used Samjeon Group's intelligence line.\\" \\"That intelligence line.\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"I might need to use it when necessary. If you help me with that, I'll go back to Korea with you and meet Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung together.\\" Suddenly, Taeguk hugged me tightly. \\"Sungguk! You're the only one for me.\\" [Taeguk, you've been caught by me again.] But I calmly patted Taeguk's back. \\"Brother, it's nothing. I'm also happy to help you.\\" * * * For a week, the news was dominated by Ashley Holmes. The first few days focused on the fact that John Kahn's embezzlement was ultimately to support his lover, Ashley Holmes' company, Bloodtherapy. The tabloids dug up everything from how the couple with a significant age gap met to John Kahn's past marriages. They speculated that Ashley Holmes was attracted to the older John Kahn due to her parents' divorce in her childhood, with various pseudo-psychologists analyzing Ashley Holmes' psychology. The public opinion slightly shifted in favor of Ashley Holmes. - In fact, Ashley could be seen as a victim of gaslighting by the experienced John Kahn. Perhaps John Kahn used Bloodtherapy to commit fraud by putting forward the blonde beauty, Ashley Holmes. After all, Ashley Holmes is undeniably lovely. Morning news shows even made such baseless speculations. As public opinion started to lean towards Ashley Holmes, John Kahn finally publicly revealed the truth about Bloodtherapy. - This is the 'Thomas' blood diagnostic kit advertised by Bloodtherapy as capable of analysis. However, this machine is actually a blood analysis machine from the German company Siemens. Now, let's compare Ashley Holmes' Bloodtherapy machine and the Siemens blood analysis machine. The news reporter showed that Ashley Holmes' machine, with the Bloodtherapy sticker over the Siemens logo, was identical to the Siemens machine. Eventually, Bloodtherapy closed down, and Ashley Holmes was engulfed in various lawsuits. The news about Ashley Holmes continued unabated. * * * Taeguk and I sat in the first-class lounge, watching the news. Taeguk kept drinking whiskey every time Ashley Holmes' news came on. Then, a piece of news that made Taeguk's eyes widen appeared. - The founder of Yahoo, Jerry Chang, also fell for Ashley Holmes and made a significant investment, indicating that the Ashley Holmes case will turn into a long battle.

[양 비서 놀랄 필요 없어. 나 좀 멋있지?] “성국 군도 정말 많이 성장했네요. 바지가 짧을 정도로요.” [뭐?] 순간, 나를 바지를 내려다봤다. 몇 달 전에 산 바지가 어느새 또 짧아져 있었다. 나는 최대한 태연하게 대처했다. “요즘 자고 일어나면 키가 커서요.” “한창 클 나이죠. 성국 군 정말 그사이 더 멋져졌어요. 잘생긴 거야 여전하고요.” [드디어 내가 듣고 싶던 말을 듣네. 양 비서 아저씨, 나야 늘 한결같지.] 나는 어깨를 으쓱했다. 이때, 전태국이 갑자기 내 팔을 손으로 꽉 잡았다. “양 비서, 내가 성국이한테 오늘 저녁 같이 먹자고 했어.” “도련님 하지만 아버님이….” “아버지도 오랜만에 성국이 보고 싶을 거야. 삼전 호텔에서 기다리신다고?” “네, 도련님.” 양 비서가 당황하는 게 보였다. 하지만 전태국은 더 이상 도망갈 곳이 없었다. “양 비서. 나랑 성국이랑 같이 이동할게. 차 준비됐지?” “도련님, 아버님께서는….” “양 비서, 왜 이렇게 말이 많아. 내가 성국이한테 약속을 했다니까. 아버지도 오랜만에 성국이 보면 좋아하실 거야.” 전태국은 내 팔을 꽉 잡고 끌었다. “성국아, 가자.” “네, 형.” 나는 얼른 대답했다. 어쨌든 거래는 거래였다. * * * 삼실 호텔의 중식당으로 들어가자 지키고 있던 매니저가 황급히 가장 안쪽 룸으로 우리를 안내했다. 양 비서가 몇 걸음 앞서나가더니 먼저 룸 안으로 들어가 전재형 회장에게 이 상황을 알렸다. 그리고 곧 전태국은 아버지 전재형 회장이 기다리고 있는 룸으로 들어갔다. “아버지, 태국이예요.” 전재형 회장은 대꾸도 하지 않았다. 나는 얼른 인사를 했다. “안녕하세요, 회장님. 전성국입니다.” 전재형 회장은 여전히 아무 말도 없었다. 룸 안에는 무거운 기류가 감돌았다. 전태국과 나는 자리를 잡고 앉았지만, 전재형 회장은 굳은 얼굴로 아무 말도 하지 않았다. [이거 느낌이 불길한걸….] 물론 나야 얻을 게 있어서 전태국의 제안을 받아들이긴 했지만, 전재형 회장의 측근들만 알고 있는 게 있다. 전재형 회장은 사방이 막힌 공간에서는 그 누구의 눈치도 보지 않는다는 사실이었다. 그리고 그 사실은 곧 증명됐다. 전재형 회장은 그대로 자리에서 일어나서 손에 쥔 파일로 전태국의 머리를 강타했다. “아, 아버지…. 왜 이러세요?” 전태국이 놀라서 전재형 회장을 올려다봤다. “지금 성국이를 데리고 와서 위기를 극복해보겠다는 속셈이냐?” “아, 아버지. 그게 아니라. 저 진짜 성국이에게 약속을 해서요.” “그건 중요치 않아. 중요한 건 내가 너에게 정말 많이 화가 났단 사실이야.” 전태국은 곧 의자에서 일어나서 무릎을 꿇었다. 그리고 전재형 회장에게 고개를 조아렸다. “아, 아버지. 그 반지 아무것도 아니에요. 그냥 애슐리 홈즈 환심을 사려고 산 거예요. 3억 별거 아니잖아요. 아버지, 예전에 여배우들한테 더 큰 것도 해주셨잖아요.” 이 말은 전재형 회장의 심기를 더 건드릴 뿐이었다. 전재형 회장은 그대로 전태국의 뺨을 날렸다. 찰싹! 그 소리가 너무 찰져서 나는 깜짝 놀라 두 사람을 바라봤다. 전태국은 붉어진 뺨을 두 손으로 잡고 있었다. 전재형 회장은 얼른 손을 풀더니 얼음물을 마셨다. “너의 그 알량하기 그지없는 환심을 사려는 행동 때문에 지금 삼전 그룹의 이름이 미국의 옐로우 페이퍼에 얼마나 등장하는 줄 알아?!” “아버지, 저는 정말 그럴 의도가 아니었어요.” “당연히 그럴 의도가 아니었겠지. 도대체 너는 머리를 어디에 달고 다니는 거야! 그 여자가 만약 재판 도중에 돈 받고 인터뷰를 하거나, 책을 내면 삼전 그룹과 후계자인 너의 이미지는 어떻게 될 것 같아?” “아버지… 그런 언론은 미국 사람들도 잘 안 믿어요.” 퍽! 전재형 회장은 그동안 조사한 자료로 다시 한번 전태국의 머리를 때렸다. “너 때문에 할아버지와 내가 힘들게 버텨온 회사의 이미지가 한순간에 추락했어!” “아버지, 대한민국에서 삼전이 추락하면 나라도 망하는 거잖아요.” 전태국은 여전히 능글맞게 굴었다. 전재형 회장은 더는 답을 하지 않고, 화를 가라앉히기 위해서 숨을 거칠게 내쉬며 옷깃을 매만졌다. 그러곤 얼마 지나지 않아서 자리에서 일어났다. “출장 다녀와서 보자. 그리고 성국아….” “네, 회장님.” “여기서 본 거 말하지 않을 것이라고 생각하마. 너도 얻은 게 있을 테니….” “걱정 마세요, 회장님.” “성국아, 아직도 짜장면 좋아하지?” “네, 회장님.” “그럼, 먹고 가렴.” “네, 회장님.” 나는 전재형 회장의 질문에 최대한 짧게 대답했다. 틈을 주기 싫어서였다. 드륵- 문이 닫히고 전태국은 이마의 땀을 닦으며 다시 자리에 앉았다. 그리곤 긴 한숨을 뱉었다. “후우…. 성국아, 그래도 너 덕분에 오늘 좀 덜 맞은 거 같아. 안 그랬으면 나 갈비뼈 몇 개 나갔을 거야.” 나는 아무 말도 하지 않았다. 전재형 회장의 성격은 나도 익히 알았다. 만약 내가 없었더라면 전태국은 내일 아침에 일어나지 못할 정도로 무언가로 맞았을 것이다. 물론 나는 저번 생에서 그런 적은 단 한 번도 없었다. 나는 항상 최고의 성적과 실적을 전재형 회장에게 가져다줬기 때문이다. 전태국은 이마의 식은땀을 닦으며 양 비서에게 지시했다. “양 비서, 음식 가지고 오라 해요.” “네, 도련님.” 전태국의 지시에 따라서 곧 중화요리가 들어왔다. 전태국은 태연하게 음식을 먹기 시작했다. “성국아, 너도 먹어.” “네, 형.” 나는 이 세상에서 가장 좋아하는 삼전 호텔의 짜장면을 흡입하기 시작했다. 전태국은 물끄러미 나를 보다 숟가락을 놓았다. “성국아, 나 또 부탁이 하나 있는데….” [뭐야, 전태국. 왜 이렇게 부탁이 자꾸 늘어?] 전태국은 간절한 눈으로 나를 쳐다봤다. “성국아, 나 오늘 하루만 재워주면 안 돼?” “형… 아버지랑 미팅도 끝났잖아요. 근데, 왜요?” “성국아, 네가 우리 아버지를 몰라서 하는 말인데. 분명 지금은 네가 함께하는 자리라 살살하신 거야. 만약 내가 혼자 있게 됐단 소식을 들으면 득달같이 달려와서 때리든 추궁하든 하실 거야. 성국아, 제발 나 좀 살려줘라.” 나는 짜장면을 마저 후루룩 마셨다. [지금 전태국을 구해주면 나에게 생기는 이득이 뭐지?] 그런 생각을 하는 사이에 전태국이 폭탄 발언을 했다. “성국아, 이번 부탁 들어주면 내가 삼전 호텔 짜장면 기다림 없이 바로 먹을 수 있는 평생 무료 이용권 줄게.” [내가 고작 먹을 거에 약해지는 사람이… 맞지!] 나는 흔쾌히 고개를 끄덕였다. “형, 우리 집으로 가요!”","completion":"Episode 180 On the plane, Jeon Tae-guk drank like a man about to meet his death. \\"Bro, we'll arrive in Korea in 10 hours. Shouldn't you stop drinking now to sober up a bit?\\" \\"Seong-guk, what should I do...\\" \\"Bro, spending 300 million was a bit too much.\\" [I told you it was a very small diamond ring!] \\"Seong-guk, you might be too young to understand... When people are blinded by love, they act like that.\\" [Wasn't your relationship with Ashley Holmes more about lust than love...] I gulped down some mineral water. \\"Bro, just don't say that to the chairman.\\" \\"Then what should I say?\\" \\"That she demanded the ring, and only by doing so would she give us, strangers from another country, an investment opportunity. You know, some lie like that.\\" Jeon Tae-guk frowned deeply as he looked at me. \\"Seong-guk, are you... lying to me about various things too?\\" [I can't say no. You don't like it, but you're not showing it.] \\"Bro, just go to sleep.\\" \\"I'll drink till the last moment. Otherwise, I might really jump out of the plane.\\" [I bet 10,000 won that won't happen.] Jeon Tae-guk downed another whiskey. To me, the problem wasn't that Jeon Tae-guk spent 300 million on Ashley Holmes. It was that the name of Samjeon Group was mentioned in the yellow press, and the whole world found out that the person who gave the ring was Jeon Tae-guk, the heir to Samjeon Group. * * * Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung meticulously reviewed the documents gathered by Secretary Yang. \\"Did you make sure to include every mention of Samjeon as I instructed?\\" \\"Yes, Chairman.\\" Secretary Yang bowed his head. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was extremely displeased. The issue wasn't the 300 million diamond. He could always give that much to any woman he was seeing or dating. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung had given more to many women. But the problem was giving a 300 million diamond to a scammer like Ashley Holmes. The yellow press was buzzing about Jeon Tae-guk, the heir to Samjeon Group. - Ashley Holmes didn't receive an investment in her business but rather a personal investment from herself. The heir to the globally renowned Samjeon Group of South Korea gifted Ashley Holmes a diamond ring worth over 300 million, which Ashley Holmes clarified in an interview was purely out of goodwill from the heir of Samjeon Group. \\"Goodwill?\\" Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's brows furrowed. - Mr. Jeon, the heir to Samjeon Group, dropped out of a university in Utah. He's already known as a liability within the company. They even added an evaluation of Jeon Tae-guk. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung was infuriated, unable to refute the truth. - Ashley Holmes, a woman who has charmed older men like John Kahn, the founder of Yahoo, Jerry Yang, and the heir to the global corporation Samjeon of South Korea, has failed in her business but is now the subject of a fierce bidding war in the publishing industry for her autobiography. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung couldn't smooth his furrowed brows as he looked at Secretary Yang. \\"Is there a chance Ashley Holmes might publish something?\\" \\"Actually, this has become the biggest issue in the US since Clinton's zippergate.\\" Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung smoothed his brow with his middle finger. \\"Secretary Yang, is there no way to prevent her from blabbering in interviews or publishing anything?\\" \\"We could set up a fake publishing company, sign a contract transferring all rights to the autobiography content in exchange for a large sum of money, and then not publish it. We can include clauses prohibiting interviews or anything favorable to us, Chairman.\\" \\"Really... do we have to go this far?\\" \\"Chairman, it's a headache, but it happened in the US. It might not significantly affect domestic public opinion.\\" Chairman Jeon pressed his temples. \\"That's for now. The world is soon to be connected as one. 'Face Note' alone is seeing explosive growth in global membership.\\" Secretary Yang had no more words. \\"When does Tae-guk arrive?\\" \\"He arrives at 4 PM. I've already reserved a table at the Samjeon Hotel restaurant.\\" \\"Make sure he doesn't run off anywhere and bring him straight here.\\" \\"Yes, Chairman.\\" * * * As soon as Jeon Tae-guk and I got off the plane, Samjeon Group's people were lined up at the gate. Secretary Yang was among them. With a gentle smile, Secretary Yang greeted Jeon Tae-guk. \\"Did you have a good trip, Young Master?\\" \\"Secretary Yang, there's no need to be so kind. I know Dad sent you to make sure I don't run away.\\" \\"Young Master, shall we go straight to the hotel? The Chairman is waiting at the Samjeon Hotel.\\" Jeon Tae-guk looked at me. \\"Secretary Yang, you know Seong-guk, right?\\" \\"Of course.\\" Secretary Yang's gaze met mine. He looked slightly impressed. [No need to be surprised, Secretary Yang. I'm quite something, aren't I?] \\"You've grown a lot, Seong-guk. Even your pants are short.\\" [What?] I suddenly looked down at my pants. The pants I bought a few months ago had already become too short. I tried to act as naturally as possible. \\"I've been growing a lot lately.\\" \\"It's the age to grow. You've become even more handsome, Seong-guk. You were always good-looking.\\" [Finally, someone says what I've been wanting to hear. Secretary Yang, I've always been consistent.] I shrugged my shoulders. Then, Jeon Tae-guk suddenly grabbed my arm tightly. \\"Secretary Yang, I promised Seong-guk we'd have dinner together today.\\" \\"Young Master, but your father...\\" \\"Father would want to see Seong-guk after such a long time, too. He's waiting at the Samjeon Hotel?\\" \\"Yes, Young Master.\\" Secretary Yang looked flustered. But Jeon Tae-guk had no more places to run. \\"Secretary Yang. I'll go with Seong-guk. Is the car ready?\\" \\"Young Master, your father...\\" \\"Secretary Yang, why so many words? I promised Seong-guk. Father will be happy to see him after a long time.\\" Jeon Tae-guk dragged me along. \\"Seong-guk, let's go.\\" \\"Yes, Bro.\\" I quickly responded. After all, a deal is a deal. * * * As we entered the Chinese restaurant at Samjeon Hotel, the manager hurriedly guided us to the innermost room. Secretary Yang walked a few steps ahead and entered the room first to inform Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung of the situation. Soon, Jeon Tae-guk entered the room where his father, Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung, was waiting. \\"Father, it's Tae-guk.\\" Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung didn't respond. I quickly greeted him. \\"Hello, Chairman. I'm Seong-guk.\\" Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung still said nothing. A heavy atmosphere filled the room. Jeon Tae-guk and I took our seats, but Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung remained silent with a stern face. [I have a bad feeling about this...] Of course, I accepted Jeon Tae-guk's offer because I had something to gain, but there was something only Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's close associates knew. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung doesn't care about anyone's opinion in a closed space. And that fact was soon proven. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung stood up and hit Jeon Tae-guk's head with the file in his hand. \\"Ah, Father... Why are you doing this?\\" Jeon Tae-guk looked up at Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung in shock. \\"Are you trying to overcome this crisis by bringing Seong-guk here?\\" \\"Ah, Father. That's not it. I really promised Seong-guk.\\" \\"That's not important. What's important is that I'm very angry with you.\\" Jeon Tae-guk immediately got up from his chair and knelt down, bowing his head to Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. \\"Ah, Father. That ring is nothing. I just bought it to win Ashley Holmes' favor. 300 million is nothing. Father, you've given more to actresses before.\\" This only angered Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung further. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung slapped Jeon Tae-guk's cheek. Slap! The sound was so crisp that I was startled and looked at the two of them. Jeon Tae-guk was holding his reddened cheek with both hands. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung quickly released his hand and drank some ice water. \\"Do you know how much Samjeon Group's name has appeared in the American yellow papers because of your foolish attempt to win favor?!\\" \\"Father, I really didn't mean to.\\" \\"Of course, you didn't mean to. What were you thinking! If that woman goes on to give interviews or publish a book during the trial, what do you think will happen to Samjeon Group and your image as its heir?\\" \\"Father... Americans don't really believe in that kind of media.\\" Thump! Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung hit Jeon Tae-guk's head with the documents he had gathered. \\"Because of you, the company's image that your grandfather and I have struggled to maintain has plummeted in an instant!\\" \\"Father, if Samjeon falls, the country falls too.\\" Jeon Tae-guk still acted cheekily. Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung didn't respond further and, trying to calm his anger, took deep breaths and adjusted his collar. Then, after a while, he stood up. \\"I'll see you after the business trip. And Seong-guk...\\" \\"Yes, Chairman.\\" \\"Don't think you won't talk about what you saw here. You'll have something to gain too...\\" \\"Don't worry, Chairman.\\" \\"Seong-guk, do you still like black bean noodles?\\" \\"Yes, Chairman.\\" \\"Then, enjoy your meal.\\" \\"Yes, Chairman.\\" I responded as briefly as possible to Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's questions, not wanting to give him any openings. Click- The door closed, and Jeon Tae-guk wiped the sweat from his forehead and sat back down, then let out a long sigh. \\"Phew... Seong-guk, thanks to you, I think I got hit less today. Otherwise, I might have broken a few ribs.\\" I didn't say anything. I was well aware of Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung's temperament. If I hadn't been there, Jeon Tae-guk might not have been able to get up tomorrow morning due to being hit with something. Of course, in my previous life, I never experienced such a thing. I always brought the best grades and results to Chairman Jeon Jae-hyung. Jeon Tae-guk, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead, instructed Secretary Yang. \\"Secretary Yang, bring the food.\\" \\"Yes, Young Master.\\" Following Jeon Tae-guk's order, Chinese food was brought in. Jeon Tae-guk began to eat calmly. \\"Seong-guk, eat too.\\" \\"Yes, Bro.\\" I started devouring my favorite black bean noodles from Samjeon Hotel. Jeon Tae-guk watched me for a while and then put down his spoon. \\"Seong-guk, I have another favor to ask...\\" [What now, Jeon Tae-guk? Why do you keep asking for favors?] Jeon Tae-guk looked at me with pleading eyes. \\"Seong-guk, can I stay with you just for today?\\" \\"Bro... The meeting with Dad is over. But why?\\" \\"Seong-guk, you don't know our father. He was gentle today because you were there. If he finds out I'm alone, he'll rush over to beat or interrogate me. Seong-guk, please save me.\\" I finished my black bean noodles. [What do I gain from saving Jeon Tae-guk now?] As I pondered, Jeon Tae-guk dropped a bombshell. \\"Seong-guk, if you do me this favor, I'll give you a lifetime free pass to Samjeon Hotel's black bean noodles without waiting.\\" [I'm someone who falls for food... Right!] I nodded eagerly. \\"Bro, let's go to my place!\\""},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"im trying to get a code to run from someone elses github, but i need some assistance","completion":"Sure, I'd be glad to help you with that. To get started, could you provide me with some more details? Specifically: 1. What's the GitHub repository you're trying to run code from? (A link to the repo would be great, but if you can't provide that, the name or a description of the project could work too.) 2. Have you already cloned or downloaded the repository to your local machine? 3. What programming language is the code written in? 4. Are there any specific instructions provided in the repository for running the code (like a README file), and if so, at what step are you encountering difficulties? 5. Do you have the necessary programming language runtime or compiler installed on your machine? For instance, if it's a Python project, do you have Python installed? The more details you can provide, the better I'll be able to assist you!"},{"prompt":"heres the link to the repository, https://github.com/NickFerd/Highlights.git","completion":"Great, thank you for sharing the link. Since I cannot directly access live URLs or specific external content due to my current setup, I can guide you through some general steps to get a code from a GitHub repository running on your machine. Here's what you typically need to do: 1. **Clone or Download the Repository** First, if you haven't already, you need to clone or download the repository to your local machine. You can do this by navigating to the repository page on GitHub, clicking the green \\"Code\\" button, and then either cloning the repository using Git or downloading it as a ZIP file. If you're using Git, open your command line or terminal and run: \`\`\` git clone https://github.com/NickFerd/Highlights.git \`\`\` This command clones the repository into a local directory named after the repository, in this case, \\"Highlights\\". 2. **Explore the Repository** - Look for a \`README.md\` file. Repositories often include this file, which contains instructions on how to set up, configure, and run the code. The \`README.md\` might also list dependencies or prerequisites you need to install first. - Check for any other documentation files or a \`docs\` directory for more information. 3. **Install Dependencies** If the project has a list of dependencies, you'll need to install them. This step varies significantly depending on the programming language and the project. - **For Python projects**: Look for a \`requirements.txt\` file or a \`Pipfile\` and install dependencies using \`pip install -r requirements.txt\` or \`pipenv install\`, respectively. - **For Node.js projects**: Look for a \`package.json\` file and install dependencies using \`npm install\` or \`yarn install\`. - **Other languages** will have their own way of managing dependencies. 4. **Compile/Build the Project (if necessary)** Some projects (especially those written in compiled languages like Java, C#, or C++) might require you to build or compile the code. The instructions for doing this should be in the \`README.md\` file. 5. **Run the Project** Instructions for running the project should also be in the \`README.md\` file. This might involve executing a specific file, running a command in the terminal, or using a project management tool specific to the programming language. - **Python example**: \`python filename.py\` - **Node.js example**: \`node filename.js\` - **Java example**: \`java ClassName\` 6. **Troubleshooting** If you run into any errors, carefully read the error messages and check the \`README.md\` or other documentation for any troubleshooting tips. Searching the web for error messages can also be incredibly helpful. If you can provide information regarding the programming language or any specific errors you encounter, I can offer more detailed advice. Remember, the key to working with someone else's code is understanding their documentation and setup instructions."},{"prompt":"i typed in pip install -r requirements.txt and it gave me ts.txt ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'","completion":"The error message you're seeing indicates that the command line or terminal cannot find a file named \`requirements.txt\` in the directory where you're trying to run the command. This usually means one of two things: 1. **You're not in the correct directory**: The most common cause of this error is that you might not be in the directory (folder) that contains the \`requirements.txt\` file when you try to run the \`pip install -r requirements.txt\` command. Make sure you navigate to the correct project directory where the \`requirements.txt\` file is located before running the command. You can use the \`cd\` (change directory) command to navigate to the correct directory. For example: \`\`\` cd path/to/Highlights \`\`\` Replace \`path/to/Highlights\` with the actual path to the cloned or downloaded Highlights project on your machine. Once you're in the correct directory, try running the \`pip install -r requirements.txt\` command again. 2. **The \`requirements.txt\` file does not exist**: It's possible that the repository you're trying to use doesn't have a \`requirements.txt\` file. In this case, you'll need to check the repository for any other instructions on installing dependencies. Sometimes, dependencies are listed directly in the README or in another file, and you'll have to install them individually using \`pip install <dependency_name>\`. Since I can't directly access external URLs such as GitHub repositories, you'll need to manually check the repository for: - A \`requirements.txt\` file or any other file that lists dependencies - Instructions in the \`README.md\` or other documentation files on how to set up and run the project If the repository doesn't have a \`requirements.txt\` file or other clear instructions on dependencies, you might need to install dependencies based on import statements in the code (for Python projects) or any documentation you can find within the project.

Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python, allowing projects to specify their dependencies in a \`pyproject.toml\` file. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the Dockerfile does, and how you can work with this setup: 1. **Base Image**: The project uses \`python:3.8-slim\` as the base Docker image. 2. **Working Directory**: Sets \`/usr/src/app\` as the working directory inside the Docker container. 3. **Install Poetry**: Installs a specific version of Poetry (\`1.2.2\`) using \`pip\`. 4. **Copy Files**: Copies the \`poetry.lock\` and \`pyproject.toml\` files to the Docker container. These files define the project's dependencies. 5. **Export and Install Dependencies**: Uses Poetry to export the dependencies to a \`requirements.txt\` file, then installs those dependencies using \`pip\`. 6. **Copy Project Files**: Copies the rest of the project's files into the Docker container. 7. **Environment Variables**: Sets the \`PYTHONPATH\` environment variable to include the project's directory and defines the timezone as Europe/Moscow. 8. **Command**: Specifies the command to be executed when the Docker container starts, which is running the \`scheduler.py\` script located in \`highlights/scripts\`. # How to Run the Project with Docker Since the project is meant to be run using Docker (given it has a Dockerfile), here's how you can proceed: 1. **Install Docker**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If you haven’t, download and install it from [the official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started). 2. **Build the Docker Image**: Navigate to the root directory of your cloned repository in the terminal or command line, and run the following command to build the Docker image: \`\`\` docker build -t highlights . \`\`\` This command builds a Docker image named \`highlights\` based on the instructions in the \`Dockerfile\`. 3. **Run the Docker Container**: After the image has been successfully built, run the following command to start a container based on your new image: \`\`\` docker run -d --name my-highlights highlights \`\`\` This command runs the Docker container in detached mode (the \`-d\` flag) and names it \`my-highlights\`. The CMD in the Dockerfile (\`python highlights/scripts/scheduler.py\`) is executed automatically. Remember, Docker encapsulates the environment setup, including installing Python, Poetry, and the project’s dependencies, within a container. This means you don't have to manually install Python or the dependencies on your own machine—Docker handles it based on the instructions in the Dockerfile."},{"prompt":"ok, im not a coder so you'll have to break it down step by step so i can get this code run properly... so lets start off after i download nd extract the project to vs code, now what would i do?","completion":"Certainly! Let's go step-by-step. For this guide, I'm assuming you've downloaded and extracted the project and you have Visual Studio Code installed. We'll use Docker, as the project seems to be configured for it, meaning you won't need to worry about installing Python or any dependencies directly on your system. # Step 1: Install Docker If you haven't already, you need to download and install Docker Desktop on your machine: 1. Go to the Docker website: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) 2. Choose the version for your operating system (Windows/MacOS), download it, and follow the installation instructions. 3. Once installed, run Docker Desktop. You might need to sign in or create a Docker account if prompted. # Step 2: Open the Project in VS Code 1. Open Visual Studio Code. 2. Go to \`File\` > \`Open Folder...\` and select the folder where you've extracted the GitHub project. # Step 3: Open Terminal in VS Code 1. In VS Code, you can open a terminal by going to the top menu and selecting \`Terminal\` > \`New Terminal\`. 2. A terminal pane should open at the bottom of the VS Code window. This terminal should be already navigated to your project's directory. If not, use the \`cd\` command to navigate to the project directory. For example: \`\`\` cd path/to/your/project \`\`\` # Step 4: Build the Docker Image 1. In the terminal you opened in VS Code, type the following command to build the Docker image based on the project's Dockerfile. This might take a few minutes the first time you do it. \`\`\` docker build -t highlights . \`\`\` 2. This command tells Docker to build an image named \`highlights\` (\`-t highlights\`) based on the Dockerfile in the current directory (\`.\`). # Step 5: Run the Docker Container 1. Once the image is built, you can run it in a container with the following command: \`\`\` docker run -d --name my-highlights-container highlights \`\`\` 2. This tells Docker to run a container named \`my-highlights-container\` in detached mode (\`-d\`) based on the \`highlights\` image. The container will execute the \`CMD\` defined in the Dockerfile, which is to run \`scheduler.py\`. # Step 6: Verify and Monitor - To see if your Docker container is running, you can use: \`\`\` docker ps \`\`\` - If you need to see the output from your container, use: \`\`\` docker logs my-highlights-container \`\`\` - This can be particularly useful to check on the execution of your \`scheduler.py\` script or to debug if anything isn't working as expected. # Conclusion With Docker, the complexity of setting up environments and dependencies is significantly reduced. By following these steps, you should be able to run the project without needing to directly handle Python, Poetry, or any of the project's Python dependencies."},{"prompt":"what does \\"copy\\" mean, th way its used in this dockerfile? its run, copy, run, run","completion":"In the context of a Dockerfile, the \`COPY\` instruction is used to copy files and directories from a specified location outside the container into the filesystem of the container at a specified path. Essentially, it's used to include your project's files, such as code, configuration files, or scripts, inside the Docker image being built. Let's break it down: 1. **Basic Syntax**: - The basic syntax of the \`COPY\` command is: \`\`\` COPY <source> <destination> \`\`\` - The \`<source>\` can be a file or directory on your local filesystem, relative to the context of the build (usually the location of the Dockerfile). - The \`<destination>\` is the path where you want these files or directories to be copied inside the container's filesystem. 2. **Usage in the Dockerfile you Posted**: Looking at the Dockerfile snippet you provided, there are a couple of \`COPY\` instructions used: a. \`COPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml ./\`: - This instruction copies the \`poetry.lock\` and \`pyproject.toml\` files from your project directory (outside the container) to the current working directory inside the container (\`./\` refers to the current working directory inside the Docker image, which was earlier set to \`/usr/src/app/\` by the \`WORKDIR\` command). b. \`COPY ./ ./\`: - This copies everything in the current directory (on your host machine, where the Dockerfile is located) into the current working directory inside the container. Again, \`./\` on the first part of the command is relative to the build context (typically the location where the Dockerfile is), and the second \`./\` refers to the container's current working directory set by \`WORKDIR\` (in this case, \`/usr/src/app/\`). 3. **Purpose**: - The purpose of these \`COPY\` instructions is to ensure that necessary files are available within the Docker container so that subsequent instructions in the Dockerfile (like running scripts or commands that depend on these files) can execute successfully. - This is crucial for steps like installing dependencies, running scripts, or configuring your application based on these files. 4. **Difference Between \`COPY\` and \`ADD\`**: - Docker also has an \`ADD\` instruction that might seem similar to \`COPY\`. While \`COPY\` is straightforward, focusing on copying local files from the build context into the container, \`ADD\` has some additional features. \`ADD\` can handle remote URLs and automatically decompress compressed files. - Despite \`ADD\`'s additional features, it is recommended to use \`COPY\` for copying local files as it's clearer and more explicit about what it does. \`ADD\` should be used for its specific capabilities (like decompression) when needed. In summary, the \`COPY\` commands in the Dockerfile ensure that your application's code and any required configuration or dependency files are present within the Docker image, allowing the application to run correctly inside the Docker container."},{"prompt":"ok so how do i apply the COPY instructions?","completion":"The \`COPY\` instructions in a Dockerfile are automatically executed by Docker during the image build process. You don't need to manually run these commands. Instead, you ensure that the files and directories specified in the Dockerfile's \`COPY\` instructions are available in the correct locations within your project. Docker then takes care of copying them into the image when you build it. Here's how it works in practice, reflecting on your scenario: # Step by Step to Applying \`COPY\` in Your Scenario 1. **Organize Your Project**: Make sure that all the files you wish to include in your Docker image are organized within your project directory—the one that contains your Dockerfile. If you're referencing specific files or directories with the \`COPY\` instruction, they need to be available relative to the Dockerfile's location. 2. **Review the Dockerfile's \`COPY\` Instructions**: For example, if your Dockerfile contains: \`\`\`Dockerfile COPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml ./ \`\`\` This means you need to have \`poetry.lock\` and \`pyproject.toml\` files in the same directory as your Dockerfile. When Docker builds the image, it will copy these files into the image's \`/usr/src/app/\` directory (assuming \`WORKDIR /usr/src/app\` is set before this instruction). 3. **Build the Docker Image**: Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile using a terminal or command-line interface. Then run the Docker build command: \`\`\`sh docker build -t your-image-name . \`\`\` This command tells Docker to build an image from the Dockerfile in the current directory (\`.\`) and tag it (\`-t\`) with the name \`your-image-name\`. During this process, Docker reads each instruction in the Dockerfile and executes it. When it comes across a \`COPY\` instruction, Docker automatically copies the specified files from your project directory into the image according to the paths and destinations you've specified. 4. **Verify**: After the build completes, if there were no errors, it means all instructions, including \`COPY\` commands, were successfully executed. Your Docker image now contains the files you specified, placed at the correct locations within the image's filesystem. # Important Notes - **File Availability**: Before running the build command, ensure the files or directories you're attempting to copy are indeed present and correctly spelled in your Dockerfile. Missing files will cause the build to fail. - **Docker Context**: When specifying paths in Docker build commands and Dockerfiles, remember that Docker can only access files within the \\"build context\\" — typically the directory where you run the \`docker build\` command and its subdirectories. It cannot access parent directories unless you explicitly set the context to include them. - **Use \`.dockerignore\`**: To speed up build times and minimize the image size, consider adding a .dockerignore file to your project. It works similarly to \`.gitignore\`, telling Docker which files or directories to ignore when building an image. That's it for applying \`COPY\` instructions—you arrange your files, reference them correctly in the Dockerfile, and Docker takes care of the rest during the image build process."},{"prompt":"so i just go to the next run instruction?","completion":"Yes, after understanding how \`COPY\` works and organizing your files accordingly, you can move on to the next instruction in your Dockerfile, often a \`RUN\` command. The \`RUN\` instruction is used to execute commands inside the container at build time, which is different from commands executed at container startup defined by \`CMD\` or \`ENTRYPOINT\`. Here's a brief overview of how to handle \`RUN\` instructions: # Understanding \`RUN\` Instructions - **Purpose**: \`RUN\` commands in a Dockerfile are used to build your Docker image. These commands can install software, set up environments, compile code, or perform task automation that prepares your image. - **Format**: A \`RUN\` instruction can take the form of a shell command (e.g., \`RUN npm install\` for a Node.js application) or can execute commands using the array format (e.g., \`RUN [\\"apt-get\\", \\"install\\", \\"package-name\\"]\`). - **Layers**: Each \`RUN\` instruction creates a new layer in the Docker image. To minimize the number of layers and keep your image efficient, you can chain commands together using \`&&\`. For example: \`\`\`Dockerfile RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package1 package2 package3 \`\`\` # Example Workflow with \`RUN\` Following your Dockerfile's progression, after the \`COPY\` instructions that set up the necessary files inside the image, you'll encounter \`RUN\` instructions to set up the environment or install dependencies. Here's an example flow: 1. Review Your Dockerfile's \`RUN\` Commands For instance, if your Dockerfile has: \`\`\`Dockerfile RUN pip install poetry==1.2.2 \`\`\` This instruction tells Docker to run the command \`pip install poetry==1.2.2\` inside the image being built, installing the specified version of Poetry. 2. Execute the Docker Build When you run the \`docker build\` command: \`\`\`sh docker build -t your-image-name . \`\`\` Docker goes through the Dockerfile line by line. For each \`RUN\` instruction, Docker executes the specified command inside a temporary container. Once the command completes, Docker commits the changes (any files added, modified, or deleted) as a new layer in the image. 3. Proceed Sequentially Dockerfiles are executed in order. After Docker handles a \`RUN\` command, it moves on to the next instruction. Sometimes \`RUN\` commands depend on the results of previous commands (like installing a package before using it), so the sequential order is crucial. 4. Build Completion After Docker has processed all instructions in the Dockerfile, including all \`COPY\` and \`RUN\` commands, the build process concludes. If successful, your image is now built with all specified configurations and ready to be run as a container. # Running Your Container Finally, with the image built, you can create and start a container from it using the \`docker run\` command: \`\`\`sh docker run --name my-container-name your-image-name \`\`\` This starts a new container named \`my-container-name\` based on \`your-image-name\`. The container executes the default command specified by the \`CMD\` or \`ENTRYPOINT\` instructions in the Dockerfile, running your application in the environment configured by your \`RUN\` commands. That's the gist of how to handle and progress through \`RUN\` instructions. They're key to customizing the Docker image to meet your project's needs, installing dependencies, and setting up environments."},{"prompt":"how do i Copy Files: Copies the poetry.lock and pyproject.toml files to the Docker container. These files define the project’s dependencies","completion":"To copy files such as \`poetry.lock\` and \`pyproject.toml\` into your Docker container, you'll use the \`COPY\` instruction in your Dockerfile. This is part of the process of building your Docker image, and it ensures that the necessary files are included in the image from which your container will be created. Here is a step-by-step explanation for how this process works, starting from having these files in your project directory: # 1. Prepare Your Project Directory Your project directory should contain: - The Dockerfile - The \`poetry.lock\` file - The \`pyproject.toml\` file - Any other files and directories that your application needs # 2. Use the \`COPY\` Instruction in Your Dockerfile In your Dockerfile, you will include a \`COPY\` instruction that looks something like this: \`\`\`Dockerfile # Syntax: COPY <source> <destination> COPY poetry.lock pyproject.toml ./ \`\`\` This \`COPY\` instruction does the following: - It takes \`poetry.lock\` and \`pyproject.toml\` from your project directory (the same location as your Dockerfile, which is considered the \\"context\\" of the build). - It copies these files into the current working directory (\`./\`) within the image. This directory is specified by the \`WORKDIR\` instruction in your Dockerfile. If \`WORKDIR\` hasn't been set before this \`COPY\` instruction, Docker defaults to the root directory (\`/\`), but it's a best practice to set your working directory using \`WORKDIR\` to a specific location within your image, such as \`/app\` or \`/usr/src/app\`. # 3. Build Your Docker Image With your Dockerfile set up to copy the necessary files, you'll next build the Docker image. From your terminal or command line, navigate to your project directory (where your Dockerfile is located) and run the following command: \`\`\`bash docker build -t myapp . \`\`\` This command tells Docker to build an image from the Dockerfile in the current directory (\`.\`) and tag it (\`-t\`) with the name \`myapp\`. Docker will go through each instruction in your Dockerfile, including the \`COPY\` instruction, thereby copying \`poetry.lock\` and \`pyproject.toml\` into the image. # 4. Verify the Copy Operation If you want to verify that the files have been copied as expected, you can run a container from your image and explore it. For example: \`\`\`bash docker run --rm -it myapp /bin/sh \`\`\` This command starts a new container from the \`myapp\` image interactively (\`-it\`), runs the shell (\`/bin/sh\`), and then removes the container on exit (\`--rm\`). Once inside the container, you can use \`ls\` to list the files in the current directory and confirm that \`poetry.lock\` and \`pyproject.toml\` are present. # Conclusion That's it! By including the \`COPY\` instructions in your Dockerfile and building your Docker image, you've successfully copied \`poetry.lock\` and \`pyproject.toml\` files into your Docker container. This is crucial for managing your project's dependencies within the containerized environment."},{"prompt":"this is someone elses project im jst trying to get the script running and outputting","completion":"Understood. If your goal is to simply run the script from someone else's project and get it outputting using Docker, here's a streamlined process to achieve that, without the need to deeply understand or modify the Dockerfile. This process assumes you have Docker installed and running on your computer, and you've got a basic familiarity with using your command line or terminal. # Step 1: Download or Clone the GitHub Project - If you haven’t already, download the project from GitHub. You can do this by visiting the project’s GitHub page and looking for a \\"Code\\" button, then choosing \\"Download ZIP.\\" Alternatively, if you're familiar with Git, you can clone the repository with \`git clone <repository URL>\`. # Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory - Extract the ZIP file (if you downloaded it) and navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command line. If you cloned the repository, navigate into the cloned directory. You can do this with the \`cd\` command followed by the path to the directory. # Step 3: Build the Docker Image - Once inside the project directory (ensure the Dockerfile is present here), run the following Docker command to build the image: \`\`\`bash docker build -t project-name . \`\`\` Replace \`project-name\` with a name of your choice for the Docker image. The dot \`.\` at the end signifies that Docker should use the current directory (where the Dockerfile is) as the build context. # Step 4: Run the Container - After the image is built, start a container from this image. Since you mentioned the script is inside the container, you’ll run the Docker container with a command that targets the script. This could look something like this command shown in the Dockerfile you provided: \`\`\`bash docker run --name project-container project-name \`\`\` - Replace \`project-container\` with a name of your choice for the running container, and \`project-name\` with the name you used to build your Docker image. # Step 5: Accessing the Output - If the script within the container writes its output to the console (standard output), you should see it in your terminal. - If the script writes its output to a file or you need to interact with the script somehow, you may need to: - **Interactively Run Your Container**: If your script requires input or you want to interact with it in a command line, add \`-it\` before the image name in the \`docker run\` command. - **Access Files Produced by the Script**: If the script generates files and you need to access them, consider using Docker volumes to map a directory from your host to your container. This way, any files written to that directory in the container will be accessible on your host machine.

The girls love playing such a rough sport and particularly enjoy the fact it gives them the opportunity to get really really muddy. For the younger girls in particular, a huge part of the appeal of rugby is getting muddy. They love not just being allowed but expected to fall, dive, slide and generally roll around in the mud and get absolutely covered in it. The older girls appreciate the skill and teamwork aspects of the sport more, but they still enjoy the mud. The girls at the school are split into three houses, each named after a flower. Please write a chapter about a muddy rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House.","completion":"Chapter 6: The Muddy Battle of Roses and Daisies On a crisp, cool morning, the fields behind the school were buzzing with excitement. Today was the day of the much-anticipated rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. The sky was overcast, hinting at rain, which only added to the girls' excitement. A recent shower had left the pitch perfectly muddy, setting the stage for a match that would be talked about for ages. The girls from both houses had been looking forward to this match. The younger members of Rose and Daisy House, especially, could hardly contain their excitement at the prospect of playing their favorite sport and getting as muddy as possible. As they warmed up, their laughter and chatter filled the air, a testament to the joy and camaraderie that rugby brought into their lives. As the whistle blew to start the game, the fields echoed with the sounds of determination and enthusiasm. From the get-go, the girls threw themselves into the match with a feverish intensity, neither side willing to give an inch. With every tackle, scrum, and sprint, the mud splashed and flew, covering the players until their house colors were barely distinguishable. The juniors of Rose House, adorned in their barely-visible red stripes, showed exceptional teamwork. With precise passes and strategic plays, they pushed forward, their eyes set on the try line. However, the Daisies, marked by their muddy yellow streaks, were no less formidable. Their defense was like a wall, unyielding and fierce, repelling Rose's advances with skill and determination. Among the juniors, a few stood out for their sheer enthusiasm for the mud. Ellie from Rose House, a fearless winger, dove for every ball as if it were a treasure, emerging each time with a bigger grin and a thicker layer of mud. On the Daisy side, Mia, a scrappy scrum-half, orchestrated her team's movements with gusto, sliding through the mud to make crucial passes and tackles. As the game progressed, the rain that had been threatening finally began to fall, adding another layer of challenge to the match. But far from dampening spirits, the rain only heightened the excitement. The pitch turned into a slippery mud bath, and the girls' efforts to maintain their footing added an element of slapstick comedy to the fierce competition. Despite the harsh conditions and fierce competition, the overriding sentiment on the field was one of pure joy. Each slip, slide, and tumble in the mud was met with laughter, and every successful play celebrated with muddy high-fives. In the end, as the final whistle blew, the score was close, but that wasn't what mattered to the juniors of Rose and Daisy House. They had played their hearts out, worked as a team, and most importantly, had the time of their lives getting covered in mud. The match ended with both teams huddled together, singing their school anthem, united in their love for the game and the muddiness it brought into their lives. As they walked back to the changing rooms, leaving a trail of muddy footprints, the girls from both houses chatted excitedly about their favorite moments of the match. It was clear that today's game would be remembered not for the scoreboard, but for the fun, friendship, and the mud that made junior rugby at their school truly special. And so, the muddy battle between the Roses and the Daisies became the stuff of legend, a tale of rivalry and unity, skill and laughter, that would be told and retold, inspiring future generations of rugby-loving girls at the school."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter about another inter-house match between Rose House and Pansy House. The pitch is not so muddy, but there are large patches of bare, clayey dirt. Every contact with the ground leaves thin layer of mud on skin or clothes.

Unlike the previous match that had been blessed with a deluge turning the field into a muddy wonderland, today's conditions presented a different challenge. The recent dry spell had hardened the ground, transforming patches of the field into areas of bare, clayey dirt. These conditions wouldn't provide the immediate satisfaction of diving into pools of mud, but they promised a different kind of fun—a gradual descent into grubbiness that would mark the players with honor by the game's end. As the match kicked off, the enthusiasm from both teams could be seen in their determined faces and agile movements. It quickly became apparent that the hardened surface would change the nature of the game. Every fall, tackle, and scrum on the clayey patches left a thin, dusty layer of earth on skin and kits, subtly changing the appearance of the players as the game progressed. Rose House, in their vibrant yet gradually browning stripes, displayed incredible agility and focus. They darted across the field, executing well-practiced plays with precision. Lucy, a quick-footed Rose flanker, made an early break, dodging tackles with grace, her path marked by a trailed cloud of dust that stuck to her like a second skin. Pansy House, identifiable by their purple hues slowly getting veiled in the earth's tinge, responded with robust strategy and teamwork. Emma, their sturdy lock, proved to be a formidable barrier, halting Rose's advances with powerful tackles that sent both her and her opponents skidding across the dusty surface, each contact leaving them more marked by the game. As the match wore on, the distinctions between the clay-stained players grew blurrier. The gradual accumulation of dirt was a testament to their involvement and commitment to the game. Slides for the ball now left long streaks on the field and the players alike, decorating them in the earth’s palette. Each player, regardless of house affiliation, began to embody the very spirit of the earth they played upon. The crowd, completely engrossed in the game, cheered on as the field gradually transformed its occupants. Each cheer was not just for the points scored, but for the tenacity and sheer joy the girls exuded. They weren't just playing rugby; they were celebrating every aspect of it, from the strategic plays down to the earthy embrace of the field. By the game's conclusion, a look at the teams no longer showed the crisp house colors but rather a spectrum of earth-toned warriors, each one beaming with the thrill of the game. Though Rose House narrowly clinched the victory through a last-minute try, the competition felt closer than the score suggested. The teams embraced and congratulated each other, their laughter and shared looks of muddy accomplishment transcending the rivalry. As they made their way off the field, the once-clear demarcations of skin, kit, and the field itself were obscured by a uniform layer of dust and dirt. They left not as separate houses but as a single, joyous collective, united by the dirt that adorned them and the memories they had made. This chapter of the Roses and Pansies wasn’t defined by the dry conditions or the dusty outcomes but by the undying spirit of the players who embraced every element of the game. Their gradual transformation into dust-covered figures wasn’t just a mark of their play but a badge of honor, depicting their love and commitment to rugby and to each other. The Dusty Duel between Roses and Pansies would be recounted as a tale not of victory or defeat but of unity, joy, and the shared love for a game that binds everyone together, no matter the conditions."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter where the English teacher asks the junior girls to write a lighthearted essay about \\"Why rugby is the best sport, because you get muddy\\".

You see, getting muddy isn’t just an inevitable consequence of playing rugby; it’s a joyous celebration, a badge of honor, and quite frankly, the reason I believe rugby is the best sport ever conceived. To start, let’s consider the design of rugby itself. It’s as if the creators sat down and pondered, “How can we ensure that players have as many opportunities as possible to get gloriously dirty?” And lo, rugby was born, a sport so perfectly aligned with the pursuit of mud, it’s almost poetic. Firstly, there’s the tackle. The very essence of rugby involves bringing your opponent to the ground. Other sports might shy away from such earthy contact, but not rugby. Here, the tackle is an art form, a joyous plunge into the muddy canvas that is the rugby pitch. Each game is an opportunity to perfect your form, to embrace the earth in a way that leaves you coated in a layer of glorious muck. Then, there’s the ruck. Ah, the ruck – a communal gathering on the ground where players tussle for the ball, pushing against each other while firmly planted in the mud. It’s like a meeting of muddy minds, a place where strategy and soil mix in equal measure. Each ruck is a chance to get a little dirtier, to collect the earth upon you as if it were a medal of valor. Let’s not forget the scrum. The scrum is rugby’s answer to those who thought there wasn’t enough contact with the ground. It’s a huddle that becomes a battleground, where the push and pull aren’t just against the opposing team but against the very earth itself. The scrum packs you down, closes you in with your teammates, and all the while, the mud seeps in, marking you, claiming you as a true rugby player. Even the simple act of diving for a try is a celebration of dirt. There’s no gentle placing of the ball here; it’s a full-bodied leap into the mud, a moment of pure ecstasy where scoring meets soil in a beautiful union. But why, you might ask, is all this muddiness so appealing? Well, in a world where being clean and tidy is often equated with properness, especially for girls, rugby stands as a glorious rebellion. It’s a statement that says, “Here, we are not afraid to get dirty. Here, we revel in the earth, we find joy in the muck, and we emerge triumphant, covered in mud, as a testament to our passion and hard work.” To play rugby is to accept an invitation to dance with the earth, to engage in a sport that cares not for cleanliness but for the sheer thrill of the game. It’s liberating, it’s exhilarating, and it’s indescribably fun. So, why is rugby the best sport? Because in a world that often asks us to stay within the lines, to keep clean, and to play it safe, rugby gives us the gift of mud. It offers us the chance to dive, fall, slide, and roll around without reprimand. Rugby understands that to get dirty is to live fully, to play passionately, and to embrace the joy in the dirt beneath our feet. In conclusion, rugby is the best sport because it celebrates not just the physicality and camaraderie of the game but the delightful, wonderful, and utterly splendid experience of getting muddy. And for that, I am forever grateful. --- Mrs. Smith, beaming with pride, knew that through this essay, she had not only encouraged a love for writing but had also allowed her girls to express the unadulterated joy that comes from their favorite aspect of rugby: the mud."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter where two parallel story threads are interwoven, with paragraphs alternating between them. One of the story threads has third year girl Ellie enjoying a lovely muddy games lesson. The girls are practicing diving for the ball and tackling using tackle bags. Ellie gets increasingly covered in mud as the lesson goes on, and she is delighted by this. The other story thread, which provides a dramatic and amusing contrast, has new first year girl Pam having her first muddy games lesson. She and her classmates have been learning the very basics of the game for about a month since they started at the school, but it has been relatively dry and the girls have returned to the changing room after each lesson with no more than a few dirt and grass stains. Today the pitch is wet, with a mixture of damp grass and puddles of mud that become increasingly gooey as the girls' own actions mix it up during the lesson.","completion":"Ellie hit the ground with a satisfying squelch, her shoulder connecting solidly with the tackle bag held by Coach Thompson. She pushed up, grinning as she felt the cool, wet mud smear across her cheek. The sensation was exhilarating, a badge of honor that signified her effort and commitment. Each dive and tackle added another layer of mud to her kit, transforming her from a third-year rugby player into a warrior adorned in the earth's palette. Across the field, Pam stood hesitantly on the perimeter of a particularly soggy patch of grass, her eyes wide as she observed her classmates' initiation into the muddier aspects of rugby. Having spent the past month mastering passes and learning rules on relatively dry ground, the sudden introduction of mud into the equation seemed like an entirely different sport. She watched as a classmate slipped, sending a spray of mud into the air, and felt a flutter of nervous excitement in her stomach. With a thorough pat down to ensure not an inch was left un-muddied, Ellie jogged back to join her team, laughing as they compared their states of dishevelment. They had been practicing diving for the ball, an exercise that seemed tailor-made for maximum muddiness. Ellie volunteered eagerly each time, throwing herself into the dives with a gusto that left her teammates cheering. When it was Pam's turn to run through the drills, her heart pounded with a mix of dread and anticipation. Coached gently into position, she eyed the muddy patch before her where she was expected to dive for the ball. With a deep breath, she sprinted forward, only to skid at the last second, landing awkwardly yet somehow managing to wrap her arms around the slick, muddy rugby ball. She stood up, a mix of surprise and pride blooming as mud dripped from her elbows. Ellie's enthusiasm seemed to infect her entire team, their drills turning into a playful mud-fest. Even the routine of tackling and passing drills took on a new life as the girls found joy in the messiness, the ground becoming more churned up beneath their boots with every step. The pitch was a canvas, and they were the artists, expressing their dedication to the game in streaks and splatters of mud. Pam, now covered in a fine sheen of mud, could feel a shift in her perception. What had initially seemed daunting was now exhilarating. With each slip and slide, she found herself laughing more freely, the apprehension replaced by a sense of camaraderie and fun. The first years were beginning to understand the unique charm of rugby played under these conditions, where every patch of mud was an invitation to let go and enjoy the moment. As the lesson neared its end, Ellie stood with her teammates, completely unrecognizable under layers of mud, their faces beaming with joy. This wasn't just about practicing rugby; it was about embracing every aspect of it, including the sheer, unadulterated fun of getting dirty. Ellie never felt more at home than she did right now, standing in the middle of a muddy rugby pitch. Pam, now thoroughly initiated into the muddy traditions of rugby at her new school, jogged off the field with her classmates, chattering excitedly. Her initial trepidation had transformed into delight, the day marking her first real understanding of the sport's unique appeal. The mud had been an unexpected teacher, showing her that sometimes, to truly enjoy something, you need to be willing to dive in, both literally and figuratively. Ellie and Pam, though at different stages in their rugby journeys, had each discovered something invaluable that day. For Ellie, it was a reaffirmation of her love for the sport and its muddier aspects. For Pam, it was an awakening to the joy and unity that such a seemingly simple element as mud could bring to a team learning and growing together. Both walked off the pitch, their spirits as buoyant as the mud was thick, bonded by the universal language of rugby and the unmistakable joy of a good, muddy game."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter where the English teacher asks the junior girls to write a lighthearted essay about \\"Why my rugby kit is perfect for playing in the mud\\".

A realm where the clash of kit philosophies often goes unnoticed. Well, at least it did by me until I transitioned from the orderly court of netball to the glorious muddy fields of rugby. My English teacher’s latest assignment, \\"Why my rugby kit is perfect for playing in the mud,\\" presents the perfect opportunity to reflect on this journey. Let me introduce you to the pristine world of netball attire first. Picture this: a neatly pleated skirt, a snug-fitting top that wouldn’t dare to get caught in the wind, and sneakers so white they'd challenge the clouds. There's an unspoken law in netball that your appearance must be as orderly as the game itself—a sport where even stepping out of your designated area is deemed a violation. Indeed, our kit mirrored this precision. It was about maintaining a look, a clear boundary between player and the rough and tumble of anything that wasn’t the polished wooden court. Venturing outdoors? Only if the weather app promised a dry, sunny day. Now, let's muddy the waters (quite literally) and talk about my rugby kit. When I was first presented with it, I'll admit, I was perplexed. The shorts seemed too robust, the jersey too loose. And the color? Let's just say that it seemed pre-stained, a shade that screamed, \\"I’ve seen things.\\" Add to this ensemble socks that could stand on their own and boots that looked as though they were designed to dig to the core of the earth. This was not a kit; it was armor, ready to laugh in the face of mud, rain, and the occasional grass stain. Playing rugby requires a certain submission to the elements. Rain or shine, the game goes on. And as I discovered, so does the accumulation of mud. What began as a patch of innocent-looking, slightly damp earth soon turned into a treacherous pit of mud-slick chaos. Here's where the genius of the rugby kit shines. The robust shorts? Perfect for withstanding the constant pull-and-tug, immune to the clingy hands of mud. The loose jersey? A trickster that deceives opponents, leaving them grabbing at fabric while I make my muddy getaway. The pre-stained color? A camouflage, blending me into the very field I battle on, making me one with the mud rather than a victim to it. And let’s not overlook the socks and boots. Those socks, seemingly knit by a group of grandmothers who knew the true meaning of 'rugby tough,' serve as the first line of defense against the cold and wet, keeping my spirits up even as I'm ankle-deep in mud. The boots, with their uncanny ability to find grip where there seems to be none, allow me to charge through the mud with the confidence of a warrior wielding a well-honed weapon. Reflecting on these two kits, it’s clear they both serve their purpose within their respective sports; yet, the contrast could not be more striking. My netball kit was about maintaining appearances, playing within tight lines, both on the court and sartorially. But my rugby kit? It’s about embracing the chaos, facing the elements head-on, and finding joy in the mud. It doesn’t ask me to stay clean and composed; it invites me to get dirty, to explore the limits of my resilience and strength. Because in rugby, every patch of mud, every grass stain, and every bit of the kit clinging stubbornly to me is a testament to my effort, my dedication, and most of all, my absolute adoration of the game. In conclusion, my rugby kit isn’t just perfect for playing in the mud; it’s a celebration of everything rugby stands for. It teaches me that it’s okay to let go, to be a part of something unpredictable and exhilarating, and most importantly, to find beauty in the mud."},{"prompt":"Please write another similar essay.

And why should it shield me? The mud is not an adversary; it’s a companion in the sport I love, a tangible sign of a game played with heart, soul, and undiluted joy. Our rugby kit, you see, is ingeniously designed not as a barrier, but as a testament to our adventures on the field. Indeed, it seems crafted with the understanding that mud is not merely an obstacle but a cherished part of the game. This realization dawned upon me as I stood there in my first rugby practice, kit in hand, marveling at its rugged simplicity. The jersey, loose and airy, doesn’t aim to keep the mud out. On the contrary, its fabric seems to hold onto the splashes and stains like a canvas proudly displaying every mark of a match well played. The shorts, sturdy and resilient, offer not a shield against the dirt but rather seem to encourage it, becoming a narrative of the game in every fabric pore, immortalizing every dive and tackle. Perhaps the most telling are the socks and boots. The socks, reaching high, don't keep the mud at bay; instead, they provide a stark white background that showcases the splatters and stains in full glory. The boots, with their deep treads, seem designed not just for traction but to collect and carry the field with every step, a testament to the ground we've covered and the battles we've fought. I stand as proof of the kit’s philosophy every time I play. My hair, once neatly tied back, becomes a wild tapestry of mud streaks; my face, a canvas where each splash of mud is a badge of daring. My arms and legs, too, don't escape the celebration; they become artworks in their own right, each smear and stain a memory of a play, a moment, a triumph. The brilliance of our rugby kit lies not in its ability to keep us clean but in its brilliant design that embraces the mud, enhancing our connection to the game and to the earth itself. Each piece tells a story, not of avoidance, but of engagement and elation. It says, “Yes, you will get dirty. Yes, it will be messy. And that’s exactly as it should be.” Why do I adore getting covered in mud, you might ask? It's simple. In a world that often demands perfection and cleanliness, especially from girls, rugby and its mud offer a liberating escape. They allow us to be wild, fierce, and free. To laugh heartily as we dive into the earth, to exult in our strength and determination, to revel in our bravery as we face each challenge head-on. This rugby kit, then, is far more than mere clothing. It’s a uniform of valor, representing a sport that glorifies not just skill and teamwork, but the sheer, unadulterated joy of playing in the mud. It teaches us that it's okay to get dirty, to wear our mud-streaked faces with pride, and to see each stain not as a mark to wash off, but as a memory to cherish. In the end, my rugby kit is perfect not because it keeps the mud away, but because it invites it in, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the beautiful, messy, and utterly wonderful world of rugby. So, here's to the mud, the splashes, the dives, and the slides.

Now, anyone who's ever seen a rugby kit knows that it treats mud not so much as an inconvenience, but as an integral part of the game's charm. But let's embark on a humorous detour and imagine a world where the \\"ideal\\" girls' rugby kit is designed with the singular goal of keeping us pristine, untouched by the \\"nasty icky mud\\". In this parallel universe, the rugby jersey would be akin to a ballgown—perhaps with a built-in corset to maintain that impeccable posture while sprinting down the field. Its fabric would be Teflon-coated, ensuring that any mud daring enough to leap from the earth would simply slide off, leaving not a speck on the ethereal white surface. It would also, naturally, feature lace-trimmed sleeves, because why not add a touch of elegance to the muddy chaos? The shorts, or should I say, the elegantly tailored culottes, would be designed with a discreetly integrated mud-repellent shield. Puddles would part as you approach, and fallen teammates would miraculously avoid splashing you as they embraced the ground. These culottes would be adorned with pockets, for one never knows when one might need to refresh their lip gloss amidst the heat of the game. Now, let's not forget about the socks—knee-high, of course, akin to those worn by genteel ladies of yore. These would be fitted with a special sensor that would emit a polite but firm \\"Ahem!\\" anytime mud came within a perilously close range, thus preserving their spotlessness through the match. And the boots—oh, the boots would be a masterpiece of design: high-heeled for that extra bit of flair, with soles that whisper across the field, leaving not a trace. Equipped with automatic self-cleaning technology, these boots would ensure that not a single mud particle dares cling to their surface. Now, back to reality—the beautifully mud-stained, gloriously messy reality of my actual rugby kit. My jersey, rather than repelling the mud, wears it like a war paint, each splash a testament to a moment of effort, determination, or sheer joy. My shorts, far from the imagined culottes, serve as a canvas for the game, collecting memories in the form of stains. The socks, stretched and muddy, stand as proud banners of my adventures on the field. And the boots, caked with the very earth we battle upon, ground me in the true essence of rugby. This real kit, my actual armor, doesn't try to protect me from the mud; it welcomes it. Because in rugby, mud isn't just part of the game—it's a part of us. It's in the shared laughter as we slip and slide, the camaraderie as we help a teammate to her feet, and the pride as we march off the field, leaving a trail of muddy footprints behind us. To imagine a rugby kit designed to keep the mud at bay is amusing, but to wear my real kit, to feel the mud cling to my hair, face, arms, and legs, is to know the true joy of rugby.

Not the kind of mud that you accidentally step in and spend the next ten minutes trying to scrape off your shoe, but the glorious, squelchy, earthy mud that you find on a rugby pitch. You see, at our school, playing rugby isn’t just about mastering the art of the tackle or perfecting your pass; it's about embracing the mud. In fact, it's not just allowed; it's expected. Mrs. Smith, our ever-enthusiastic English teacher, has asked us to pen our thoughts on this very topic, and I couldn’t be more thrilled to dive in—figuratively and literally. Imagine stepping onto the field, the atmosphere electric with anticipation, and the ground a canvas of untold stories. Then, as you look down at the unwritten permission slip that is your rugby kit, you realize something extraordinary: you are about to become part of the earth in a way that few other sports allow. In rugby, each dive into the mud, each slide for the ball, and every tackle is not just a play; it’s a rite of passage. To emerge from the game without a single speck of mud would be, in our world, downright scandalous. It’s like the school has handed us a golden ticket to a world where getting dirty is not just accepted, but celebrated. The rugby pitch is our Chocolate Factory, and we, the enthusiastic Charlies, dive into every mud puddle with gusto, knowing that with each muck-covered jersey and clay-laden knee, we're embracing the heart of the game. The beauty of this expectation lies in its transformational power. Before my rugby days, a splatter of mud on my clothes would have elicited a sigh and a quick search for a stain remover. Now? It’s a badge of honor, a physical manifestation of dedication, and frankly, a lot of fun. We are warriors, not in spite of the mud, but because of it. But why, you may wonder, does this muddy expectation captivate us so? The answer is simple: it tears down barriers—between us and nature, between \\"ladylike\\" expectations and the freedom to just be. In the mud, we're all equal—laughing, struggling, and striving side by side. The mud doesn’t care if you’re the fastest, the strongest, or the newest player on the team. It embraces everyone just the same, leaving its mark as a reminder that we gave our all. Consider the art of the mud slide—an endeavor not for the faint of heart, yet encouraged at every turn by our coaches. It's a technique as thrilling as it is effective, turning would-be tackles into exhilarating dashes that end in exuberant, muddy heaps. This isn’t just playing the game; it’s reveling in it, finding joy in every splash and squelch. And so, as I sit here, adorned in the remnants of today’s game, I can’t help but smile. Our kits, designed not to repel the mud but to welcome it, are symbols of this beautiful, unspoken agreement. In this world, to be muddy is to be free—to have embraced the sheer, unadulterated joy of playing rugby not just with skill, but with heart. In conclusion, it’s not just that we’re allowed to get muddy; it’s that we’re expected to. This expectation isn’t a burden, but a gift—a reminder that sometimes, the best thing you can do is let go, get dirty, and find joy in the beautiful mess. Through rugby, we learn not just to accept the mud, but to wear it proudly as a testament to our passion, our commitment, and our unyielding enthusiasm for the game we love. And to think, all this profundity, all this freedom, all this joy, it all starts with a bit of mud."},{"prompt":"Please give one of the girls' essays in full.

It was a day that challenged the very fabric of our rugby-loving hearts, a day when a group of girls—let’s call them \\"The Clean Team\\"—decided that mud was their nemesis. Their mission? To navigate a full rugby practice without so much as a speck of dirt sullying their pristine uniforms. Picture this: a rugby pitch, the aftermath of last night’s rain turning it into a glorious, inviting quagmire, just begging for a game. Enter stage left, The Clean Team, decked in their spotless kits, faces determined, yet filled with a sense of doom at the impending muddy chaos. The first drill was simple: passing the ball while standing still. The Clean Team excelled, their passes crisp and accurate, their stances impeccable. Ah, but little did they know, their true test was yet to come. \\"Time for tackling practice,\\" bellowed Coach, pointing towards the designated, and notably muddy, tackle area. The color drained from The Clean Team’s faces as they approached the mud with the caution of someone navigating a minefield in stilettos. Jessica, a self-appointed leader of The Clean Team, had a moment of inspiration. \\"What if,\\" she whispered, \\"we just pretend to fall?\\" And so, they devised a plan. As each member took their turn, they performed a series of elaborate, slow-motion dives that would make a mime proud, carefully avoiding any actual contact with the mud. The spectacle was unlike any before. For every faux-tackle, a chorus of gasps and giggles erupted, not just from The Clean Team, but from the entire class, who found themselves thoroughly entertained by the theatrics. Next up, scrum practice. The Clean Team huddled, their strategy discussion intense. \\"What if we just... don't push too hard?” suggested Emma, hopeful. And thus, the gentlest scrum in the history of rugby unfolded before our very eyes. Both sides pushed against each other with the force of a light breeze, careful not to slip and fall into the muddy abyss below. The final act of this comedy of terrors was the mud slide. A classic move, often the highlight of any rugby girl’s day, yet a looming nightmare for The Clean Team. As they lined up, the fear was palpable. One by one, they approached the slide area, only to gracefully sidestep at the last moment, throwing themselves onto the slightly less muddy grass with all the flair of a swan landing on a still lake. As the practice came to a close, The Clean Team stood proudly, their kits still remarkably clean, but their spirits dampened. They had successfully avoided the mud, but at what cost? Around them, their classmates were laughing, sharing stories of particularly epic slides and dives, their muddy uniforms a testament to their adventures. In the end, The Clean Team learned a valuable lesson: that in the world of rugby, mud is not just an obstacle, it's a part of the joy. It's in the laughter shared after a spectacular dive, the camaraderie built through shared struggles in the scrum, and the sense of accomplishment felt after giving it your all, regardless of how dirty you get. So, here's to mud, the great equalizer, the creator of memories, and the reason why our rugby lessons are the highlight of our week. May we always dive in with open hearts and come out a little dirtier, a little happier, and a lot closer to our teammates. Sincerely, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, an honorary (but thoroughly muddy) member of The Clean Team."},{"prompt":"Please give one of the girls' essays in full.

The characters? A spirited group of rugby enthusiasts and a cadre of girls for whom the very notion of mud spelled disaster. The plot twist? Our formidable games mistress, Mrs. Henderson, a known advocate of the \\"embrace the mud\\" philosophy. The scene opens on the rugby pitch, a gloriously mucky expanse following a night of relentless rain. As the class gathered, a palpable divide emerged: on one side, the Mud Lovers, eager to dive into the day's practice; on the other, the Clean Team, a group that viewed the pitch's condition with a mix of horror and disbelief. \\"Today,\\" began Mrs. Henderson, her eyes scanning the ranks, \\"we tackle the art of, well, tackling. And yes, it will be messy.\\" A murmur of excitement buzzed through the Mud Lovers. The Clean Team, however, looked as if they'd been asked to swim across the English Channel. In winter. \\"I refuse to ruin my new shoes!\\" protested Emily, a vocal Clean Team member, lifting a pristine white sneaker for emphasis. \\"And my hair!\\" chimed in Sophie, her ponytail held in place with an assortment of meticulously chosen accessories. Mrs. Henderson, undaunted by the burgeoning rebellion, simply smiled. \\"Ladies,\\" she addressed the dissenters, \\"rugby is not a spectator sport. And in this field, mud is your friend.\\" But the Clean Team was not to be swayed. They devised a game plan akin to a ballet troupe navigating a stage slick with grease. Tackles were executed with a delicacy that bordered on mime performance, each player hovering inches above the ground before gently descending, as if the earth were a forbidden zone. Mrs. Henderson, taking note of these airborne antics, decided it was time for a real-world demonstration. With a grace that belied her years and a gleam in her eye, she launched into a tackle that ended with her gloriously coated in mud from head to toe. \\"This,\\" she declared, rising triumphantly, \\"is rugby!\\" The Mud Lovers erupted in cheers, the Clean Team in gasps. The standoff continued through the scrum practice. The Clean Team's strategy of 'minimal contact, maximum distance' turned the scrum into something more closely resembling a group hug than a fervent battle for the ball. \\"Our jerseys will be ruined,\\" whispered a concerned Clean Team member as they eyed the ensuing mud bath. \\"Rugby jerseys are meant to be muddy,\\" Mrs. Henderson countered, her own kit now a testament to the pitch's generous offerings. \\"They're badges of honor.\\" The climax of this muddy drama came with the slide drills. The Clean Team, having maintained a semblance of cleanliness thus far, faced their ultimate test. One by one, under the watchful eye of Mrs. Henderson, they approached the slide zone. Then, a miracle! Whether it was the spirit of rugby, the persuasive power of peer enthusiasm, or Mrs. Henderson’s infectious, mud-splattered grin, the Clean Team relented. They slid, they slipped, they laughed, and yes, they got thoroughly and utterly muddy. As the lesson drew to a close, and the Clean Team surveyed their transformed appearances—hair askew, kits amorphously muddy, smiles wide—it was clear that Mrs. Henderson's firm stance had ushered in a new era of rugby appreciation. In her debrief, Mrs. Henderson, now more mud than mistress, commended the class. \\"Today,\\" she concluded, \\"you learned that rugby is not just about skill and strategy. It's about heart, teamwork, and yes, getting gloriously filthy.\\" And so, the games lesson that began with a standoff ended with unity, as both Mud Lovers and the newly converted Clean Team shared in the laughter and camaraderie that only a good, muddy day of rugby can bring. Who knew that a firm line and a field full of mud could be such powerful teachers?"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, by 1921, as the film industry began to mature and the studio system started to take shape, the production costs also started to standardize to some degree. During this period, the average cost of producing a feature film in Hollywood could be anywhere from around 50,000 to 200,000. It's important to note that these figures could fluctuate significantly based on the extravagance of the film, the salaries of the stars involved, and other production-related costs. For context, consider that some of the more lavish productions of the time could exceed these averages considerably. As an example, \\"The Kid\\" (1921), a Charlie Chaplin film, had a reported cost of around 250,000 (though some of that would have gone towards Chaplin's own salary, as he was a major star as well as the writer, director, and producer). On the other hand, smaller, independent productions could be made for much less. Inflation has dramatically changed the value of the dollar since then, so while these figures might seem small by today's standards, they represented significant investments at the time."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This specific combination captures the essence of Japanese aesthetics, philosophy, and history, offering a profound visual narration. To frame this captivating style within the rich tapestry of Japanese art, let's explore the elements that contribute to its distinct allure: # 1. **The Samurai Legends** Samurai, the military nobility of medieval and early-modern Japan, have been a source of fascination both within Japan and internationally. Their stories—rich with honor, bravery, and a strict code of ethics (Bushidō)—resonate deeply in the Japanese cultural psyche. Ink drawings depicting these warriors often capture not just the physical likeness but the very spirit of the samurai, embedding within them tales of battles, loyalty, and the philosophical contemplation of life and death. # 2. **Intricate Brushwork** The art of ink drawing, or Sumi-e, is a form of East Asian brush painting that uses black ink—the same type used in East Asian calligraphy. Sumi-e seeks not just to replicate the subject's appearance but to capture its soul. The brushwork is both simple and profoundly intricate. Artists must master control over the brush, varying pressure, and angle to create a vast array of lines and textures from the finest hairline to the broadest swathes of darkness. This intricacy is particularly effective in rendering the detailed armor of samurai, the delicate features of their faces, and the varied textures of the natural world around them. # 3. **Setting Sun** The setting sun is a powerful symbol in many cultures, often representing the end of an era, the passage of time, or a moment of reflection. In the context of samurai ink drawings, it can add a layer of poignancy and transcendence. As the sun sets, it might cast long shadows, creating contrasts and highlighting the fleeting beauty of the moment, much like the bushido code emphasizes the impermanence of life. The delicate gradations of light to dark achieved through the masterful use of ink can evoke the transient glow of sunset, casting the legendary figures in a moment suspended in time. # 4. **Combining the Elements** In creating a scene set in this style, an artist would carefully balance the dynamic figures of the samurai with the serene, almost melancholic beauty of the setting sun. The intricate brushwork allows for a detailed portrayal of the samurai and their environment, capturing the texture of armor, the fluidity of movement, and the emotional depth of the scene. The backdrop of the sunset, with its rich gradients and contrasts, adds an ethereal quality, suggesting the transient beauty and sadness of the samurai's world. This style of art is not merely a technical achievement but an emotional journey, inviting the viewer to contemplate themes of duty, beauty, impermanence, and the complex interplay of light and darkness. Japanese ink drawings of samurai under the setting sun thus stand as a poignant testament to the enduring legacy of Japan's warriors, rendered with a depth and sensitivity that transcends cultural and temporal boundaries."},{"prompt":"Create a good FM24 tactic that uses a 433 formation that uses a high Pressing style of play.

Fact 37: Sadece insanlar ve köpek balıkları dişlerini kaybettiklerinde yeni diş çıkarabilirler. Belki geçmişte çok iyi arkadaşlardık, kim bilir? Fact 38: Kuzey Kore ve Küba, ABD'den metrik sistemi kullanmayan tek ülkelerdir. Görünüşe göre, bazen farklı olmak iyi bir şey olabilir. Fact 39: Bir güve, bir yarasadan daha yüksek frekanslarda ses çıkarabilir. Bu, yarasa süper kahramanların aslında süper kahraman olduğunun kanıtı olabilir. Fact 40: Bir pirana, tek bir ısırıkla bir insan parmağını ısıra bilir, ama merak etmeyin, çünkü genellikle bunu yapmak istemezler. Yani aslında hepsi yanlış anlaşılan balıklar.

There are many altemative theories to proft maximisation, explain one such theory. 6 response for the 6 questions above must have 1200 words","completion":"Given the expansive nature of these questions, it would be challenging to delve deeply into each with exhaustive detail within a single, concise response. Let's try a high-level overview to fit the framework: # 1. Impact of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns on Costs The Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns states that as more units of a variable input (like labor) are added to a fixed input (like machinery), the additional output per unit of the variable input will eventually decrease. This impacts costs in two ways: - **Marginal Cost (MC):** Initially, MC decreases because the additional output from each new unit of input can be high. However, as diminishing returns set in, each additional unit of input produces less output, leading to an increase in the marginal cost of production. - **Average Total Cost (ATC):** ATC follows a U-shaped curve due to diminishing returns. Initially, ATC decreases as outputs increase due to economies of scale, but as diminishing returns overshadow the increasing production, ATC rises. # 2. Long-Run Average Cost Curve The Long-Run Average Cost (LRAC) curve illustrates the lowest average cost at which a firm can produce any given level of output in the long run, where all inputs are variable. It is typically U-shaped due to economies and diseconomies of scale. Initially, as the firm increases output, it benefits from economies of scale, leading to diminishing LRAC. Beyond a certain point, diseconomies of scale set in, causing LRAC to increase. Influences on the LRAC include: - Technological advancements - Input prices - Management practices # 3. Profit Maximization: MC = MR The concept of profit maximization, where Marginal Cost (MC) equals Marginal Revenue (MR), is a core principle of economic theory. It dictates that the optimal output level for a firm, in terms of maximizing profit, is reached when the cost of producing an additional unit (MC) is exactly equal to the revenue generated from selling that unit (MR). This is because: - If MR > MC, producing more adds to profit. - If MR < MC, production costs exceed revenue gains, reducing profit. # 4. UK Energy Market: Oligopoly **Characteristics of Oligopoly:** - Few firms dominate the market. - High barriers to entry. - Firms may collude to set prices. - Products may be differentiated or homogeneous. **Price and Output Behavior in UK Energy Firms:** In the oligopolistic UK energy market, firms tend to avoid price competition, leading to higher prices and possibly less output compared to more competitive markets. Firms may engage in non-price competition and use strategies like price leadership. The fear of triggering price wars means that prices may be more \\"sticky\\" and not reflect cost fluctuations immediately. # 5. Why Firms Cannot Earn Supernormal Profits in the Long Run in Perfect Competition In a perfectly competitive market, firms cannot earn supernormal (abnormal) profits in the long run due to: - **Free Entry and Exit:** If firms earn supernormal profits, new entrants are attracted to the market, increasing supply and reducing prices. - **Price Takers:** Firms are price takers and must accept the market price, which, in the long run, equals average total cost. This equilibrium ensures that, in the long run, firms only make normal profits, where total revenues equal total costs. # 6. Alternative Theories to Profit Maximization: Sales Maximization Theory One alternative theory is the Sales Maximization Theory proposed by William J. Baumol. It suggests that managers, rather than seeking to maximize profits, aim to maximize sales revenue, subject to earning a minimum level of profit demanded by shareholders. This theory explains why firms might prioritize market share or revenue growth over direct profit maximization, influenced by motives such as job security, market dominance, and operational scale advantages. --- This response aims to cover a broad perspective on each query, providing a foundational understanding rather than an exhaustive analysis due to word constraints.

Impact of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns on Costs **Marginal Cost (MC):** The law of diminishing marginal returns states that as more of a variable input (like labor) is added to a set amount of fixed inputs (like machinery), the added output from each additional unit of input eventually decreases. Initially, as production ramps up, MC tends to decrease because the additional output from each new unit of input can be relatively high, and spreading fixed costs over a larger output lowers the cost per unit. However, as the input continues to increase, the additional output per unit declines, leading to increased MC. This occurs because, at some point, additional inputs are less effectively utilized due to the fixed quantity of other inputs. Hence, MC begins to rise, reflecting the higher cost of producing additional units under diminishing returns. **Average Total Cost (ATC):** ATC initially decreases as output increases due to the spreading out of fixed costs over a larger number of units (economies of scale) and possibly improvements in efficiency (e.g., learning curve effects). However, as the law of diminishing marginal returns begins to outweigh the initial efficiencies, producing additional units adds more to total cost than to total output, pushing ATC upwards. Thus, ATC exhibits a U-shaped curve due to this dynamic. # 2. The Long-Run Average Cost Curve and Its Influences The Long-Run Average Cost (LRAC) curve represents the minimum average cost of production achievable at different levels of output when all inputs are variable (i.e., there are no fixed inputs). Key characteristics of the LRAC include its U-shape, reflecting economies and diseconomies of scale. Initially, as a firm increases its scale of operation, it benefits from economies of scale – factors such as specialization of labor, better use of technology, and more efficient use of capital resources, leading to a decreasing LRAC. Beyond a certain point, diseconomies of scale set in due to factors like bureaucracy, communication challenges, and logistical inefficiencies, causing LRAC to increase. Influences on the LRAC include technological advancements (which can shift the entire curve downwards), changes in input prices (affecting the cost of production at all scales), and variations in the organization and efficiency of production processes. # 3. Profit Maximization Where MC Equals MR The principle that firms maximize profit where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR) is foundational in economics. At any output level where MR exceeds MC, the firm increases its profit by producing more units because each additional unit adds more to revenue than it does to cost. Conversely, if MC exceeds MR, the firm can increase profit by reducing output, as the cost of the last units produced exceeds the revenue they generate. Profit maximization occurs where MC = MR, as producing more or less would lead to missed profit opportunities or outright losses. This intersection point dictates the optimal output level for profit-seeking firms. # 4. The UK Energy Market: Oligopoly and Behavior **Characteristics of Oligopoly:** - Few firms dominate supply, each with significant market share. - High barriers to entry exist, protecting incumbent firms from new entrants. - Firms may engage in strategic behavior, considering rivals' potential responses when making pricing or investment decisions. **Behavior in the UK Energy Market:** Large UK energy firms operate in an oligopolistic market structure, characterized by mutual interdependence. These firms might avoid aggressive price competition to maintain stable and profitable prices, engaging instead in non-price competition tactics (service quality, reliability, green energy initiatives). However, regulatory oversight aims to curb monopolistic tendencies and protect consumers. The UK's push towards renewable energy and the entrance of smaller energy suppliers have introduced more competition, yet the dominance of the 'big six' and its impact on pricing and market behavior exemplifies oligopolistic dynamics. # 5. No Long-Run Supernormal Profits in Perfect Competition In perfectly competitive markets, firms cannot earn supernormal profits in the long run due to the absence of barriers to entry. If firms in the market are earning above-normal profits, new firms will be attracted to the market, increasing supply until prices fall to the point where only normal profits (covering opportunity costs) are possible. In equilibrium, firms produce where price equals marginal cost (P = MC) and price equals average total cost (P = ATC), leaving no room for supernormal profits. Hence, the characteristics of perfect competition – infinite buyers and sellers, homogeneous products, perfect information, and no barriers to entry or exit – ensure that profits are normalized in the long run. # 6. Alternative Theories to Profit Maximization: Managerial Theories One notable alternative to profit maximization is Baumol's Sales Maximization Theory. Under this theory, managers prioritize revenue growth over profits as their performance and hence compensation are often linked more directly to sales levels rather than to profit performance. The theory suggests that firms strive to maximize sales revenue subject to maintaining a minimal profit level acceptable to shareholders. This could explain why companies invest in advertising and product development to increase sales, even at the expense of short-term profits. Such behavior emphasizes market share and revenue growth over immediate profitability, reflecting a departure from traditional profit-maximizing models. --- This detailed response aims to explicate the economic principles and real-world implications underlying each question, enhancing comprehension of complex market behaviors and strategic decisions within the business and economic landscape."},{"prompt":"第四问请以英国的The Big Six 为参考详细回答","completion":"For a more detailed response concerning the behavior and characteristics of oligopoly specifically referencing the \\"Big Six\\" energy companies in the UK, we delve into their role within the energy sector. **The Big Six and Oligopoly Characteristics:** The \\"Big Six\\" refers to the six largest energy companies operating in the United Kingdom up until recent years, namely British Gas, EDF Energy, E.ON UK, npower, Scottish Power, and SSE. These companies dominated the UK energy market in terms of electricity and gas supply, holding a substantial majority of market share (over 90% combined at their peak). Their presence represents classic oligopolistic traits: - **Concentration of Market Power:** A significant market share was concentrated in these six companies, enabling them to influence market prices and conditions to a considerable degree, although not completely like a monopoly. - **Interdependent Decision-Making:** Actions by one company (for example, pricing strategies or promotional offers) would often prompt reactive measures from the others. This mutual interdependence is a hallmark of oligopolistic markets. **Behavior Specifics of the Big Six:** 1. **Pricing and Non-price Competition:** - While direct price wars were uncommon, the Big Six engaged in non-price competitive strategies including loyalty rewards, customer service enhancements, and bundled products (offering gas and electricity in a single package). - They employed a tiered pricing structure where longstanding customers often ended up on higher tariffs, while new customers received more competitive rates. This strategy maximized revenue from 'sticky' customers reluctant or unable to switch providers, while attractive introductory rates lured new customers. 2. **Market Entry Barriers:** - Significant barriers to entry have maintained the Big Six's market dominance. These barriers included the high capital cost of energy generation and distribution networks, regulatory compliance costs, and the challenge of building a customer base in a market where incumbents have strong brand recognition and customer loyalty. - However, regulatory changes aimed at increasing competition have gradually lowered these barriers, leading to an influx of smaller energy suppliers. 3. **Regulatory Interaction:** - The Big Six's behavior has been subject to significant scrutiny and regulation by Ofgem (the UK's energy regulator). Efforts to prevent misuse of market power and protect consumers have included imposing price caps on default tariffs and measures to simplify tariff structures. - Additionally, policies promoting renewable energy and decarbonization have forced the Big Six to adapt, investing in green energy sources and innovation. **Recent Market Dynamics:** The landscape has been changing, with increased competition from smaller suppliers encouraged by regulatory measures and consumer willingness to switch providers promoting a more competitive environment. The number of households supplied by smaller firms grew significantly, reducing the Big Six's combined market share to below 70% by 2019. These shifts have compelled the Big Six to further refine their competitive strategies, focusing more on customer service, innovative energy solutions, and sustainability efforts to retain or grow their market shares. Moreover, several mergers and acquisitions have occurred. SSE’s retail business merged with npower's, and E.ON acquired npower, demonstrating the sector's dynamic nature and indicating strategies to maintain competitiveness and manage operational costs amidst challenging market conditions and tighter margins. **Conclusion:** The dominance of the Big Six in the UK energy market provides an illustrative example of oligopolistic market behavior, highlighting the complexities of operating and regulating such markets. Pricing strategies, market entry barriers, regulatory interactions, and the recent trend toward more competition and sustainability are crucial factors shaping the strategies and fortunes of these major players in the energy sector."},{"prompt":"中文回答","completion":"针对英国“六大”能源公司在寡头垄断市场中的行为和特点，我们可以深入探讨这些公司如何影响英国能源领域。 **“六大”能源公司及其寡头垄断特征：** “六大”指的是英国六家最大的能源公司：英国燃气（British Gas）、法国电力公司（EDF Energy）、E.ON UK、npower、苏格兰电力（Scottish Power）和SSE。这些公司曾在英国电力和天然气供应市场占据绝大多数市场份额（在高峰时期共占市场份额的90%以上），体现了典型的寡头垄断市场特征： - **市场集中度高**：这六大公司控制了绝大部分市场份额，使得它们能够对市场价格和条件产生重大影响。 - **相互依赖的决策**：一家公司的行为（比如定价策略或促销活动）经常会引发其他公司的反应。这种互相依赖是寡头垄断市场的典型特征。 **“六大”能源公司的具体行为：** 1. **定价和非价格竞争：** - 尽管直接的价格战并不常见，但“六大”通过忠诚度奖励、客服体验提升以及捆绑产品（提供一揽子电气服务的套餐）等方式进行非价格竞争。 - 它们采用分级定价结构，老客户往往会被自动转移到更高的费率上，而新客户则能享受更具竞争力的价格。这一策略旨在从那些不愿或找不到更好选择的“长期客户”中最大化收入，同时通过吸引性的入门价格招揽新客户。 2. **市场进入壁垒：** - 高昂的能源生成和分销网络建设成本、遵守监管成本以及在一个已有强势品牌和客户忠诚度的市场中构建客户基础，都是维持“六大”市场主导地位的重要壁垒。 - 然而，旨在增加竞争的监管改革逐渐降低了这些壁垒，引入了更多较小的能源供应商。 3. **监管互动：** - “六大”公司的业务受到Ofgem（英国能源市场监管机构）的密切监视和监管。为了防止市场力量滥用和保护消费者，Ofgem采取了诸如对默认费率设定价格上限和简化费率结构的措施。 - 此外，促进可再生能源和脱碳政策也迫使“六大”适应，它们投资于绿色能源来源和创新。 **近期市场动态：** 随着监管措施的引入和消费者更愿意更换供应商，市场竞争增加，小型供应商占据的家庭数量显著增长。“六大”的综合市场份额到2019年已降至70%以下。这种转变迫使“六大”进一步优化竞争策略，更加注重客户服务、创新能源解决方案和可持续发展努力，以维持或增加市场份额。 此外，已经发生了几起合并和收购事件，例如SSE的零售业务与npower合并，E.ON收购了npower，显示了该部门的动态性，并表明在挑战性的市场条件和较紧的利润空间下，如何保持竞争力和管理运营成本的策略。 **结论：** “六大”在英国能源市场的主导地位为寡头垄断市场行为提供了一个说明性的例子，突出了运营和监管这类市场的复杂性。“六大”的定价策略、市场进入障碍、监管互动以及面向更多竞争和可持续发展的趋势是塑造这些主要能源公司策略和命运的关键因素。"},{"prompt":"4. 参考英国的电力和天然气能源市场： (a) 描述寡头垄断的特征 (b) 参照寡头垄断理论，解释英国大型能源公司的价格和产出行为。","completion":"# (a) 寡头垄断的特征 寡头垄断市场是由少数几家公司占据绝大部分市场份额的市场结构。这种市场结构的关键特征包括： 1. **市场集中度高**：市场被少数几家公司控制，这些公司的决策能够影响整个市场的价格和产量。 2. **互相依赖性**：在寡头垄断市场中，每个企业的策略选择都高度依赖于其他竞争对手的行为。一家公司的定价、产量或其他市场行为会影响其他所有公司的利益，因此它们必须在决策时考虑对手的可能反应。 3. **进入壁垒**：寡头市场往往存在高昂的进入壁垒，例如高额的启动资金、对专门技能的需求或严格的政府规制等。这些壁垒阻碍了新竞争者的进入，使得现有的寡头能够保持其市场地位。 4. **非价格竞争**：由于直接的价格竞争可能会引发价格战，从而损害所有企业的利润，寡头垄断企业更有可能通过广告、产品差异化以及提高服务质量等方式进行竞争。 # (b) 英国大型能源公司的价格和产出行为 参照寡头垄断理论，我们可以解释英国大型能源公司在电力和天然气市场的价格和产出行为： 1. **价格刚性**：英国的大型能源公司在设定价格时通常会显示出一定程度的刚性。这意味着即使成本或需求发生变化，价格也不会立即调整。这种现象部分是由于公司之间的默契行动避免竞争激化，其中一家公司可能会等待其他公司首先改变价格。 2. **非价格竞争的偏好**：与其通过降低价格来争夺市场份额，英国的大型能源公司更有可能通过改善客户服务、提供节能咨询、推广绿色能源方案等手段吸引顾客。这些策略有助于公司巩固其市场地位，同时避免损害利润的价格战。 3. **对进入壁垒的维护**：英国的大型能源公司通过一系列策略维护市场壁垒，包括在关键基础设施上的投资，以及与政府部门密切合作确保对行业的法规有利于维持现状。这些做法使得新竞争者难以进入市场，维护了现有企业的市场控制权。 4. **定价策略**：大型能源公司可能会采用分层定价策略，为不同类型的客户（如家庭用户和商业用户）提供不同的价格和服务计划。这种做法使得它们能够针对各个细分市场最大化利润，同时保持对主要市场段的控制权。 总之，英国的大型能源公司利用寡头垄断市场结构的特点，在维持稳定价格的同时，通过非价格竞争和维护行业壁垒来保护其市场份额和利润率。他们的行为体现了寡头垄断理论中的关键概念，包括市场集中度高、进入壁垒以及企业间的竞争与合作策略。"},{"prompt":"给我详细的英文回答","completion":"To elaborate on the characteristics of an oligopoly and the behavior of major energy companies in the UK's electricity and gas market, we need to dive deeper into both theoretical frameworks and specific market practices. # (a) Characteristics of Oligopoly Oligopolies are market structures dominated by a few large firms, often characterized by: 1. **Limited Competition:** A small number of firms control a significant share of the market. While they compete, their actions are highly interdependent. 2. **High Barriers to Entry:** Significant obstacles prevent new entrants from easily joining the market. These can include high initial investment requirements, regulatory barriers, control over essential resources, and established brand loyalty. 3. **Product Differentiation or Homogeneity:** Products may be differentiated (as in the case of automobiles) or almost identical (as in oil and gas), depending on the sector. 4. **Price Rigidity:** Prices tend to be sticky downwards, meaning firms prefer to compete on aspects other than price, such as service quality, branding, and product differentiation, to avoid price wars. 5. **Mutual Interdependence:** Decisions by one firm (on pricing, output, etc.) can significantly impact the others, leading to a strategic decision-making environment where considering competitors' potential reactions is crucial. 6. **Non-Price Competition:** Firms often engage in marketing, advertising, and other forms of non-price competitive strategies to increase market share and customer loyalty. # (b) Behavior of Major UK Energy Companies Given the oligopolistic nature of the UK's energy market, particularly concerning the \\"Big Six\\" (British Gas, EDF Energy, E.ON UK, npower, Scottish Power, and SSE), we can observe several strategic behaviors as follows: 1. **Strategic Pricing:** Instead of aggressive price competition, major energy firms in the UK engage in strategic pricing. They may adjust tariffs carefully to reflect cost changes slowly or to respond to competitors’ pricing strategies without triggering a race to the bottom. Price adjustments are often strategic, aimed at maintaining market stability and profitability. 2. **Non-Price Competition:** These firms focus on differentiating their offerings through customer service, bundled products (combining electricity, gas, and sometimes Internet services), renewable energy options, and loyalty programs. The emphasis is on adding value to retain existing customers and attract new ones without directly competing on price. 3. **Market Segmentation:** By segmenting the market (e.g., residential vs. business customers), companies can tailor their services and pricing schemes to various consumer needs, maximizing profitability from each segment. Tailored services can include specialized business energy solutions, flexible payment plans for residential customers, and incentives for long-term contracts. 4. **Regulatory Compliance and Lobbying:** The energy market in the UK is heavily regulated. Large firms must navigate this regulatory landscape carefully, often engaging in lobbying efforts to influence energy policy in ways that favor their operational model. Compliance with regulations and adapting to policy changes are key competitive strategies. 5. **Investment in Infrastructure and Technology:** Control over, or significant investment in, energy infrastructure (such as power plants and grids) and technology (like smart meters) acts as a barrier to entry for new competitors. These investments also allow for more efficient operations and the potential to offer innovative services, further reinforcing their market position. 6. **Environmental and Sustainable Energy Initiatives:** Public concern over environmental issues and governmental regulations on carbon emissions have pushed large energy firms to invest in renewable energy sources and promote their \\"green\\" initiatives. This serves both to comply with regulations and to attract environmentally conscious consumers. In conclusion, the behavior of the major energy firms in the UK's oligopolistic market illustrates complex interaction between strategic decision-making, regulatory navigation, and competitive positioning. Through a combination of strategic pricing, non-price competition, and investments in infrastructure and technology, these companies work to maintain and enhance their market dominance while adapting to regulatory and societal changes."},{"prompt":"中文回答","completion":"在详细探讨英国电力和天然气能源市场上主要能源公司的寡头垄断特征和行为时，我们需要深入理解理论框架和特定市场实践。 # (a) 寡头垄断的特征 寡头垄断是由少数大型企业主导的市场结构，其主要特征包括： 1. **有限的竞争**：市场由少数几家企业控制，占据了大部分市场份额。尽管这些公司之间存在竞争，但是它们的行为高度相互依赖。 2. **高进入壁垒**：存在重大障碍阻止新进入者轻易加入市场。这些障碍包括高额的初始投资要求、监管壁垒、对关键资源的控制以及既有的品牌忠诚度。 3. **产品差异化或同质化**：根据行业的不同，产品可能存在差异化（如汽车）或几乎相同（如石油和天然气）。 4. **价格刚性**：价格往往具有向下粘性，意味着企业更倾向于在价格以外的方面（如服务质量、品牌和产品差异化）进行竞争，以避免价格战。 5. **相互依赖性**：一家公司在定价、产量等方面的决策可能会显著影响其他公司，导致一个需要考虑竞争对手可能反应的战略决策环境。 6. **非价格竞争**：企业经常通过市场营销、广告和其他非价格竞争策略来增加市场份额和客户忠诚度。 # (b) 英国大型能源公司的行为 鉴于英国能源市场特别是“六大”（British Gas、EDF Energy、E.ON UK、npower、Scottish Power 和 SSE）的寡头垄断性质，我们可以观察到以下几种战略行为： 1. **战略定价**：英国的主要能源公司在定价时采用战略手段，而不是激进的价格竞争。它们可能会小心调整电价，以缓慢反映成本变化或响应竞争对手的定价策略，而不会触发价格战。 2. **非价格竞争**：这些公司专注于通过客户服务、捆绑产品（结合电力、天然气，有时还包括互联网服务）、可再生能源选择和忠诚度计划来区分其产品。强调增值以留住现有客户并吸引新客户，而不是直接通过价格竞争。 3. **市场细分**：通过对市场（例如住宅与商业客户）进行细分，公司可以根据各种消费者需求量身定制服务和定价方案，从每个细分市场中最大化利润。 4. **监管遵守和游说**：英国能源市场受到严格监管。大型公司必须小心地通过这一监管环境，常常参与游说活动以影响能源政策，使之有利于它们的运营模式。遵守规则和适应政策变化是关键的竞争策略。 5. **对基础设施和技术的投资**：控制或显著投资于能源基础设施（如发电厂和电网）和技术（如智能表）作为新竞争者的进入壁垒。这些投资还允许更有效率的运营和提供创新服务的潜力，进一步加强市场地位。 6. **环境和可持续能源举措**：公众对环境问题的关心和政府关于碳排放的监管推动大型能源公司投资于可再生能源和推广其“绿色”举措。这既为了遵守规定，也为了吸引环境意识较强的消费者。 总之，英国寡头垄断市场中主要能源公司的行为描绘了复杂的战略决策、监管导航和竞争定位之间的互动。通过战略定价、非价格竞争以及基础设施和技术投资的组合，这些公司努力维持和增强其市场主导地位，同时适应监管和社会的变化。"},{"prompt":"5. 5. 解释为什么在完全竞争的市场中，企业无法长期获得超常/正常利润。 您的回答应提及完全竞争市场的特征，并包含一个或多个图表以支持您的解释","completion":"在完全竞争的市场中，企业无法长期获得超常利润的原因根植于完全竞争市场的定义性特征。完全竞争市场的特征包括： 1. **参与者众多**：市场由大量买者和卖者组成，单一企业对市场价格的影响微乎其微。 2. **同质产品**：所有企业提供的商品或服务在消费者眼中是相同的，无差异化。 3. **自由进入和退出**：新企业可以自由进入市场或退出市场，没有进入壁垒。 4. **完全的信息**：所有参与者对市场信息（包括价格和技术）具有完全的了解。 5. **价格接受者**：单个企业由于市场规模庞大，不得不接受市场决定的价格，自己无法设置价格。 基于以上特征，我们可以解析为什么企业无法长期获得超常利润： - **短期超常利润会吸引新进入者**：如果在完全竞争的市场中，个别企业因为效率高等原因获得了超常利润，这将会吸引新企业进入该市场。由于市场的自由进入和退出特性，新企业的加入会增加市场的总供给。 - **价格随着供给增加而下降**：随着供给量的增加，为了出售更多的产品，市场价格必须下降。价格的下降会一直持续到所有企业的利润回归到正常利润水平，也就是说企业的总收入恰好覆盖其总成本（包括机会成本）。 - **长期均衡下的正常利润**：在长期均衡状态下，企业无法获得超常利润的情况会维持稳定。如果有企业获得了超常利润，就会再次触发新企业的进入和价格的调整机制，直到利润再次回归正常利润水平。 图表说明： 由于无法直接在文本响应中插入图表，我们可以描述一个典型的完全竞争市场长期均衡的图表应该包含以下内容： 1. **需求曲线**：虽然对单个企业而言是水平线（表示它们是价格接受者），但总市场需求呈负斜率。 2. **供给曲线**：在完全竞争市场中，短期供给曲线可能呈正斜率（反映边际成本上升），长期供给曲线可能是完全弹性的（水平线），反映了新企业的进入。 3. **均衡点**：均衡点在需求曲线和供给曲线的交点，企业的平均总成本曲线（ATC）在此点刚好与市场价格相等。 通过这样的图表，我们可以直观地看到，任何试图提高价格或获得超常利润的企业都会面临市场供给增加和价格下降的局面，最终导致所有企业回归仅获得正常利润的状态。"},{"prompt":"给我英文回答","completion":"In a perfectly competitive market, firms are unable to earn supernormal (abnormal) profits in the long term due to the defining characteristics of perfect competition. These characteristics include: 1. **Numerous Participants**: The market consists of a large number of buyers and sellers, where no single firm can influence the market price. 2. **Homogeneous Products**: All firms offer identical products or services, with no differentiation in the eyes of consumers. 3. **Free Entry and Exit**: New firms can freely enter or exit the market without barriers. 4. **Perfect Information**: All participants have complete knowledge of market conditions, including prices and technology. 5. **Price-Takers**: Individual firms, due to the vast size of the market, must accept the price determined by the market; they cannot set their prices. Given these features, the reason firms cannot sustain supernormal profits in the long term can be explained as follows: - **Short-Term Supernormal Profits Attract New Entrants**: If any firm in a perfectly competitive market achieves supernormal profits, possibly due to higher efficiency, it will attract new firms to the market. The characteristic of free entry and exit allows for an influx of new firms, increasing the market's total supply. - **Price Decreases with Increased Supply**: As supply increases, to sell more products, the market price must fall. This decrease in price will continue until all firms' profits return to a normal level, meaning that a firm's total revenue just covers its total costs, including opportunity costs. - **Normal Profits in Long-Term Equilibrium**: In a long-term equilibrium state, the situation where firms cannot earn supernormal profits is sustained. If any firm does achieve supernormal profits, it will trigger the entry of new firms and the price adjustment mechanism again until profits return to normal levels. **Diagram Explanation**: While diagrams cannot be inserted directly into a text response, a typical diagram illustrating long-term equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market would include: 1. **Demand Curve**: For an individual firm is perfectly elastic (horizontal line), reflecting that they are price takers, but the overall market demand curve slopes downward. 2. **Supply Curve**: In a perfectly competitive market, the short-term supply curve might slope upward (reflecting rising marginal costs), but the long-term supply curve could be perfectly elastic (horizontal), reflecting new firm entry. 3. **Equilibrium Point**: The equilibrium is found at the intersection of the demand and supply curves. At this point, the firm's average total cost curve (ATC) exactly meets market price. Through such a diagram, it becomes visually apparent that any attempt by firms to raise prices or earn supernormal profits will face increased market supply and decreased prices, ultimately forcing all firms back to a state where they only earn normal profits."},{"prompt":"Sign of pelviureteric junction obstruction in ivu","completion":"Intravenous urography (IVU), also known as intravenous pyelography (IVP), is an imaging technique used to visualize the urinary system, including the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. Pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction is a condition where there is a blockage at the junction where the renal pelvis transitions into the ureter, leading to impaired flow of urine from the kidney to the ureter. The signs of pelviureteric junction obstruction on an IVU include: 1. **Delayed Nephrogram**: There is a delay in the appearance of the excreted contrast material in the affected renal pelvis and ureter compared to the unobstructed side. 2. **Dilatation of the Renal Pelvis**: This is a hallmark sign, where there is accumulation of urine in the renal pelvis causing it to dilate because of the obstruction at the pelviureteric junction. 3. **Dilatation of the Calyces**: The calyces (the cup-shaped cavities that collect urine in the kidney) may also appear dilated because of the backup of urine. 4. **Tapering of Ureter at PUJ**: The ureter may appear normal in caliber or slightly dilated until it narrows or tapers at the site of obstruction at the pelviureteric junction. 5. **Delayed Drainage**: The affected side shows delayed drainage of the contrast medium compared to the unaffected side. In severe cases, the drainage might be so delayed that the contrast medium is still visible in the collecting system on delayed images, sometimes hours after administration. 6. **Presence of \\"Washout Curve\\"**: On delayed images, there might be a significant reduction in the density of contrast within the renal pelvis compared to earlier phases, indicating impaired but continuous drainage. 7. **Absent or Reduced Ureteric Jet on Fluoroscopy**: If fluoroscopy is part of the IVU procedure, an absent or significantly reduced ureteric jet on the affected side might be observed compared to the normal side. It's important to note that while IVU can provide useful information, it has been largely replaced by ultrasonography and CT urography in many clinical scenarios for diagnosing PUJ obstruction due to the latter having better diagnostic capabilities and being less invasive."},{"prompt":"I think there are sign like clubbing in ivu","completion":"Apologies for any confusion. In the context of pelviureteric junction (PUJ) obstruction and your interest in specific signs like \\"clubbing\\" observed in intravenous urography (IVU), let's clarify: The term \\"clubbing\\" is not typically used in the description of IVU findings for PUJ obstruction. However, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or a mix-up with terminology. In the setting of PUJ obstruction on an IVU, we discuss dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces, and the appearance might be described using terms relevant to the shape and function of these structures rather than \\"clubbing,\\" which is more commonly associated with physical changes in the fingernails and fingertips seen in various systemic conditions. For PUJ obstruction in IVU, the key signs would include: - **Dilation of the Renal Pelvis and Calyces**: This is seen as an enlargement of the renal pelvis and the cup-shaped areas that collect urine from the renal pyramids. The dilation may give the renal pelvis a \\"ballooned\\" appearance due to the accumulation of urine behind the obstruction. - **Tapering at the PUJ**: The site of obstruction may show a smooth narrowing or tapering where the renal pelvis transitions to the ureter, which is a hallmark feature of PUJ obstruction. It's possible there was confusion or a mix-up of terms when discussing the condition. The dilatation and changes in the structure as seen in IVU or other imaging modalities due to PUJ obstruction can resemble various descriptions, but the term \\"clubbing\\" is not standard in this context. If the discussion was actually oriented towards radiographic features resembling \\"clubbing\\" in a different organ or condition (notably, \\"clubbing\\" is a term entirely out of context here), that would be a different matter. In radiology, accurate and consistent terminology is crucial for clear communication, and each term applied in the context of imaging findings is specific to what it describes. To sum up, in the context of PUJ obstruction observed through IVU, we speak of dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces and the tapering of the ureter at the junction. Each of these signs helps in diagnosing the condition and understanding its severity."},{"prompt":"\\" Floyd Mayweather Jr., a legendary boxer known for his defensive mastery, often puts on his opponents by controlling the pace of the fight, using footwork to evade punches, and frustrating his opponents with a strong defense\\" explain please and make it a detailed breakdown line by line segment by segment in a detailed way","completion":"Floyd Mayweather Jr., an iconic figure in the world of boxing, is renowned for his unparalleled skills within the ring. His approach to combat is defined by several signature strategies, emphasizing defense, control, and psychological manipulation of his opponents. Let's dissect the tactics employed by Mayweather round by round, to understand the depth of his mastery in the boxing realm. # Defensive Mastery Firstly, Floyd Mayweather Jr. is celebrated for his defensive prowess. Unlike many fighters who might rely on sheer aggression or power, Mayweather turns defense into an offensive tool. His ability to avoid damage not only preserves his stamina and wellbeing throughout the fight but also serves as a demoralizing force against his opponents. This defensive skill set is multifaceted, involving several techniques: - **Shoulder Roll**: This is a signature move where Mayweather uses his front shoulder to deflect incoming punches. By tucking his chin behind the raised shoulder, he minimizes the target area, making it exceptionally hard for opponents to land clean hits. - **Head Movement**: Mayweather's unpredictable head movement makes him a difficult target. He can bob and weave, slipping past punches with minimal movement, conserving energy while frustrating his opponents who waste theirs. # Controlling the Pace Mayweather's ability to control the pace of the fight is unparalleled. He dictates when exchanges happen, often slowing down the fight to his comfort level. By doing so, he forces his opponents to fight on his terms: - **Selective Engagement**: Mayweather engages with his opponents on his own terms, choosing moments when he's most likely to score without taking unnecessary risks. This not only conserves his energy but also keeps his opponents guessing. - **Breaks and Clutches**: Utilizing clinches strategically, Mayweather can disrupt his opponent's rhythm, buying himself time to recover or to recalibrate his strategy. # Using Footwork to Evade Punches Floyd Mayweather's footwork is a critical component of his defensive strategy. His movement around the ring is calculated and purposeful: - **Efficient Movement**: Rather than unnecessary flamboyancy, Mayweather's footwork is all about efficiency. He stays light on his feet, ready to move out of range or circle away from his opponent's dominant hand. - **Positional Advantage**: Mayweather constantly positions himself in a way that makes it difficult for his opponents to land effective punches. By staying at angles, he reduces the number of viable targets for his opponents. # Frustrating Opponents with Strong Defense The culmination of Mayweather's defensive strategy, pace control, and evasive footwork often leads to his opponents' frustration. When fighters cannot land significant blows, they often become impatient, leading to mistakes: - **Psychological Warfare**: Mayweather's style is as much psychological as it is physical. By showing that he is untouchable, he often leads his opponents to overcommit or exhaust themselves trying to penetrate his defense. - **Counter-Punching**: With his opponents frustrated and making mistakes, Mayweather takes the opportunity to counter-punch. His excellent timing and speed allow him to exploit the openings created by his opponents' aggression. In summary, Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s boxing technique is a testament to the art of defense, strategic control, and psychological dominance in the ring. Each round against Mayweather is a lesson in futility for many of his opponents, as they struggle to connect, tire themselves out, and ultimately fall victim to his calculated counter-attacks. Through his career, Mayweather has not only showcased his incredible skill set but also redefined what it means to be a defensive boxer at the highest level of the sport."},{"prompt":"\\" Floyd Mayweather Jr., a legendary boxer known for his defensive mastery, often puts on his opponents by controlling the pace of the fight, using footwork to evade punches, and frustrating his opponents with a strong defense\\" explain please and make it a detailed breakdown line by line segment by segment in a detailed way of the whole paragraph, by fragments","completion":"Certainly! Let’s break down the description of Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s boxing style, one part at a time, detailing the significance and execution of each tactic. 1. **\\"Floyd Mayweather Jr., a legendary boxer\\"** - This introduces Floyd Mayweather Jr. as not just any boxer, but a legendary figure in the sport. The term \\"legendary\\" highlights his esteemed position, acknowledging his achievements, longevity, and influence in boxing. 2. **\\"known for his defensive mastery\\"** - This segment explains what sets Mayweather apart from many other boxers: his unparalleled defensive skills. \\"Defensive mastery\\" implies an exceptional level of skill in avoiding damage from opponents. In boxing, good defense is often as celebrated as offensive power since it showcases a boxer's intelligence, technique, and adaptability in the ring. 3. **\\"often puts on his opponents by\\"** - There seems to be a slight confusion in the phrasing here. Typically, one might say Mayweather \\"puts pressure on his opponents\\" or \\"puts a clinic on for his opponents.\\" The essence here is that Mayweather employs a strategy or a set of techniques which he consistently applies against opponents during fights, impacting their performance or state of mind. 4. **\\"controlling the pace of the fight,\\"** - This strategy involves dictating when and how the action unfolds. Mayweather uses his experience and ring IQ to make fights happen at a rhythm that suits him, often slowing down faster opponents or disrupting the rhythm of aggressive fighters. This control can frustrate opponents and force them into making mistakes. 5. **\\"using footwork to evade punches,\\"** - Mayweather is well-known for his exceptional footwork, a fundamental component of his defensive arsenal. By using nimble, precise movements, he's able to position himself out of harm's way. This doesn't just mean moving away from punches, but also positioning himself to counterattack effectively, maintaining a balance between defense and offense. 6. **\\"and frustrating his opponents with a strong defense\\"** - Beyond just avoiding punches, Mayweather's defensive skills are mentally taxing on his opponents. His ability to effortlessly block, dodge, and deflect attacks can demoralize adversaries. When fighters cannot land significant blows, their frustration mounts, which can lead to overcommitting or hesitancy, both of which Mayweather expertly capitalizes on. Putting it all together, this description of Floyd Mayweather Jr. underscores his reputation as a defensive genius in the sport of boxing. He leverages his understanding of pace, masterful footwork, and an impenetrable defense to control fights, frustrate opponents, and secure victories.

However, it's important to note that \\"put up a fight\\" is the more commonly used expression to describe someone resisting, showing opposition, or defending themselves against something or someone. It implies making an effort to contend or struggle against difficulties, opposition, or attempts at control. \\"Put on a fight,\\" on the other hand, is less common and might be used in contexts where someone is perhaps staging, organizing, or demonstrating a fight—this could be a literal physical contest (like a boxing match) or a more metaphorical struggle. The phrase might also suggest an element of performance or pretense, as in not genuinely engaging in the struggle but rather displaying an appearance of doing so. In summary: - \\"Put up a fight\\" typically means to resist, oppose, or struggle against someone or something with effort. It suggests a genuine attempt to defend oneself or stand up against challenges. - \\"Put on a fight\\" could be interpreted as making a show or display of resistance, possibly without genuine commitment, or it could be understood in a more literal sense of organizing a physical contest. However, the usage of \\"put on a fight\\" in this way is less standard, and the phrase is more likely to be encountered as a slight misuse or variation of \\"put up a fight.\\""},{"prompt":"Puedo darte una lista desordenada de títulos de libros para que la órdenes alfabéticamente?","completion":"¡Claro!

At this school the girls all play rugby regularly instead of more traditional girls' sports. The girls love playing such a rough sport and particularly enjoy the fact it gives them the opportunity to get really really muddy. For the younger girls in particular, a huge part of the appeal of rugby is getting muddy. They love not just being allowed but expected to fall, dive, slide and generally roll around in the mud and get absolutely covered in it. The older girls appreciate the skill and teamwork aspects of the sport more, but they still enjoy the mud. The girls at the school are split into three houses, each named after a flower. Please write a chapter about a muddy rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. It hasn't rained that much lately, but the pitch is a delightful mix of sticky gooey mud and grass.","completion":"# Chapter Seven: The Muddy Match at Jasmine Towers Dawn broke over Jasmine Towers, painting the imposing school building in hues of soft pink and gold. Today was not just another day; it was the day of the much-anticipated rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. Although the skies were clear now, the pitch told stories of the showers that had intermittently graced the school over the past week. It was in prime condition for what the girls loved most about rugby – a gloriously muddy play. Meg Carter, a third-year from Rose House, peeked out of the dormitory window, her eyes shining at the sight of the rugby pitch far below. It was a gorgeous mishmash of green and brown, the latter promising a delightful amount of muck for the day’s game. She turned back to her room, where her friends were already getting into their rugby kits, the air abuzz with excitement. “Looks like it’s going to be a perfect day for rugby,” Meg beamed, pulling on her own jersey, its red rose emblem sitting proudly over her heart. “I can’t wait to dive into that mud,” came the gleeful response from Emily Jenkins, a fellow Rose House teammate. The girls shared a moment of laughter, imagining the inevitable state they’d all be in by the end of the match. Down at the pitch, both teams were warming up, their laughter and chatter floating up into the crisp morning air. Despite being rivals on the field, the camaraderie between the girls from different houses was evident, their shared love of the sport and, specifically, the joy of playing in the mud binding them together. As the whistle blew to signal the start of the match, a hush fell over the gathered spectators. The ball was kicked off, soaring high before landing squarely in a particularly gooey patch of mud, splattering several girls in the process. This only elicited cheers and giggles; they were here for this exact experience. Meg found herself in possession of the muddy ball early on, her boots squelching satisfyingly in the mud as she darted forward. Daisy House was quick to respond, their defenders moving in swiftly. In an attempt to dodge one, Meg slipped, sliding several feet in the mud before coming to a halt, the ball still clutched tightly in her grasp. The spectators erupted into cheers, equally divided between both houses, as Rose House and Daisy House supporters showed their appreciation for the spirited display. Daisy House fought hard, pushing forward with a determination that was commendable. Lydia Green, a quick-footed winger for Daisy, made an impressive run down the sideline, mud splashing with every step until she was tackled just short of the try-line by Rose House’s scrum-half, a cheerful girl named Sophie who came up beaming with mud streaked across her face. As the match progressed, it became evident that, although the older girls might appreciate the strategy and teamwork more profoundly, they were no less fond of the mud than their younger counterparts. Dives were made with a little more enthusiasm than strictly necessary; tackles seemed to aim for the muddiest parts of the pitch, and everyone, regardless of house loyalty, relished the joy of playing in such fantastically messy conditions. When the final whistle blew, signaling a narrow victory for Rose House, the pitch was dotted with exhausted but exhilarated players, each one covered head to toe in mud. They shook hands and hugged, the rivalry forgotten in the shared exuberance of the game they loved. As they walked back to the changing rooms, leaving a trail of muddy footprints, Meg thought to herself that there really was no better way to spend a day than playing rugby at Jasmine Towers. Especially when it allowed for such unbridled revelry in the mud. The day had been a testament to the spirit of the school and the bonds formed on and off the rugby pitch. Rose House and Daisy House might have been opponents today, but the mud had been everyone’s friend, and in that, they all found unity. That evening, as Meg sat cleaning her boots outside the dormitory, the events of the day replaying in her mind, she felt a deep sense of contentment and belonging. Jasmine Towers was more than just a school; it was a place where girls could challenge themselves, get gloriously muddy, and build friendships that would last a lifetime."},{"prompt":"The Regal Cycle Company manufactures three types of bicycles—a dirt bike, a mountain bike, and a racing bike.

Management is concerned about the continued losses shown by the racing bikes and wants a recommendation as to whether or not the line should be discontinued. The special equipment used to produce racing bikes has no resale value and does not wear out. Required: 1. What is the financial advantage (disadvantage) per quarter of discontinuing the Racing Bikes?","completion":"To determine the financial advantage or disadvantage of discontinuing the Racing Bikes line, we first need to understand which costs will be eliminated if the line is discontinued and which costs will remain unaffected. From the provided data, if the Racing Bikes line is discontinued, the company will no longer incur variable manufacturing and selling expenses related to Racing Bikes, nor the traceable fixed expenses (advertising for racing bikes, depreciation of special equipment for racing bikes, and salaries of product-line managers for racing bikes). However, the allocated common fixed expenses will still need to be covered by the remaining products. Here are the costs specifically associated with Racing Bikes that would be eliminated: 1. Variable manufacturing and selling expenses: 153,000 2. Advertising, traceable: 20,900 3. Depreciation of special equipment: 15,700 (even though it has no resale value and does not wear out, it's considered a cost saved if we're no longer using it for racing bike production) 4. Salaries of product-line managers: 36,600 Total expenses saved by discontinuing Racing Bikes: 153,000 + 20,900 + 15,700 + 36,600 = 226,200. However, the sales of 255,000 will also be lost. Therefore: Financial Impact = Lost Sales - Saved Expenses = -255,000 - (-226,200) = -255,000 + 226,200 = -28,800 Discontinuing the Racing Bikes will result in a financial disadvantage of 28,800 per quarter. This means that even though the Racing Bikes line is currently operating at a loss, it is still contributing 28,800 more to covering fixed costs than it would if the line were discontinued."},{"prompt":"wrong answer","completion":"Let's correct the oversight and accurately assess the financial impact of discontinuing the Racing Bikes line, considering both the direct costs saved and the loss of contribution margin that would result from discontinuing the line. Contribution Margin for Racing Bikes: - The contribution margin for Racing Bikes is given as 102,000. This figure is derived from sales minus variable costs and represents how much of the sales revenue is available to cover fixed costs and contribute to profit. Fixed Costs Exclusively Related to Racing Bikes: 1. Advertising, traceable: 20,900 2. Depreciation of special equipment: 15,700 - Note: Even though the special equipment used for racing bikes has no resale value and does not wear out, for the purpose of this analysis, the depreciation is a cost assigned to the racing bike product line. However, since it has no alternative use and does not wear out, discontinuing the product line wouldn't save this cost in cash terms, but it's considered here for the full costing perspective. 3. Salaries of product-line managers: 36,600 Total Fixed Costs directly eliminated if we discontinue Racing Bikes: - Directly eliminated fixed costs = 20,900 (Advertising) + 36,600 (Salaries) = 57,500 Allocated common fixed expenses would possibly be redistributed among the remaining products or potentially remain unchanged in the immediate term. To correct the initial approach: Financial Impact of Discontinuing = Lost Contribution Margin - Saved Fixed Costs - Lost Contribution Margin: 102,000 (Contribution margin specifically for Racing Bikes) - Saved Fixed Costs: 57,500 (Directly attributable fixed costs) Financial Impact: - Financial Impact = -102,000 - (-57,500) - Financial Impact = -102,000 + 57,500 - Financial Impact = -44,500 The correct financial disadvantage per quarter of discontinuing the Racing Bikes line is 44,500. This means that, contrary to the initial incorrect figure, discontinuing the Racing Bikes would actually result in losing 44,500 per quarter that currently contributes towards covering the company’s fixed costs and overall profitability. I neglected to consider that the depreciation of the special equipment for racing bikes does not result in cash savings if discontinued, as the equipment has no resale value and does not wear out."},{"prompt":"Troy Engines, Limited, manufactures a variety of engines for use in heavy equipment.

To evaluate this offer, Troy Engines, Limited, has gathered the following information relating to its own cost of producing the carburetor internally: Per Unit 20,000 Units per Year Direct materials 17 340,000 Direct labor 10 200,000 Variable manufacturing overhead 2 40,000 Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable 9* 180,000 Fixed manufacturing overhead, allocated 12 240,000 Total cost 50 1,000,000 *One-third supervisory salaries; two-thirds depreciation of special equipment (no resale value).

Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable: Since this includes one-third supervisory salaries and two-thirds depreciation of special equipment (with no resale value), some of these costs may not be saved immediately if production is shifted outside. However, for this analysis, we'll consider that the \\"traceable\\" part suggests these costs are directly related to the carburetor production and might be saved. So, this amounts to 180,000. 2. Fixed manufacturing overhead, allocated: These costs are likely to remain since they represent the allocation of overall facility costs not directly tied to the production of any one part. They're more likely part of the general overhead that won't change if production of carburetors is outsourced. Thus, 240,000 of these costs would likely remain. Total annual cost to buy externally: 36 x 20,000 = 720,000 So, the financial disadvantage (or advantage) calculation of outsourcing is based on comparing the net savings from not producing the carburetors against the cost of buying them externally. Financial disadvantage calculation: - Total variable cost savings: 580,000 - Fixed manufacturing overhead (traceable) savings: 180,000 Total savings if production is stopped: 580,000 + 180,000 = 760,000 Cost of buying externally: 720,000 Net financial advantage (or disadvantage) of buying externally: Savings from not producing - Cost of buying = 760,000 - 720,000 = 40,000 Thus, there would actually be a financial advantage of 40,000 per year by buying the carburetors from the outside supplier, not a disadvantage, under the given conditions and assuming all traceable fixed costs could be eliminated. If the company has no alternative use for the facilities, it means they're considering fully removing these costs associated with carburetor production."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Required: 1. Assuming the company has no alternative use for the facilities that are now being used to produce the carburetors, what would be the financial advantage (disadvantage) of buying 20,000 carburetors from the outside supplier?","completion":"To calculate the financial advantage or disadvantage of buying 20,000 carburetors from the outside supplier instead of producing them in-house, we need to compare the total relevant costs of both options. Fixed costs that are not avoidable or that do not change with the decision are not relevant for this calculation. Here are the calculations based on the provided data: # Cost of In-house Production - Direct materials: 340,000 - Direct labor: 200,000 - Variable manufacturing overhead: 40,000 - Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable: 180,000 - Note: While fixed, this cost is considered traceable directly to the production of carburetors and is considered relevant if it can be avoided by not producing them. - *Fixed manufacturing overhead, allocated*: 240,000 - Note: This cost is not relevant because it represents allocated overhead that will likely not change regardless of the decision to make or buy the carburetors. Total relevant costs of in-house production= Direct materials + Direct labor + Variable manufacturing overhead + Traceable fixed manufacturing overhead = 340,000 + 200,000 + 40,000 + 180,000 = 760,000 # Cost of Buying - Cost of buying 20,000 carburetors: 36 per unit - Total cost of buying = 36 * 20,000 units = 720,000 # Financial Advantage (Disadvantage) Calculation To find out the financial advantage or disadvantage of buying carburetors, we subtract the total cost of buying from the total relevant cost of making them in-house: Financial advantage (disadvantage) = Cost of in-house production - Cost of buying = 760,000 - 720,000 = 40,000 This calculation indicates a financial advantage of 40,000 for buying the carburetors from the outside supplier compared to producing them in-house, assuming there is no alternative use for the facilities that would generate additional income."},{"prompt":"Dejo una lista de 20 títulos de libros.

Рассмотрим несколько ключевых аспектов, связанных с пониманием человечества: 1. **Биологическая перспектива:** С точки зрения биологии, человечество — это вид Homo sapiens, обладающий уникальными когнитивными способностями по сравнению с другими живыми существами. Эта перспектива включает изучение эволюции человека, генетики и физиологии. 2. **Философская перспектива:** В философии человечество рассматривается через призму сознания, самосознания и моральных вопросов. Основные проблемы касаются природы разума, свободы воли, сущности бытия и этического отношения к другим людям и миру в целом. 3. **Социологическая и антропологическая перспектива:** Они изучают человечество через культурные, социальные и экономические системы, которые люди создают и в которых они участвуют. Эти науки исследуют, как общественные структуры и институты влияют на поведение и взаимодействия людей. 4. **Психологическая перспектива:** Психология сосредотачивается на изучении умственных функций, эмоций и развития индивидуума. Важными аспектами являются понимание того, как люди воспринимают мир, как формируются их личности, и какие психологические механизмы стоят за человеческим поведением. 5. **Экономическая перспектива:** Рассматривает человечество через призму экономических взаимодействий и зависимостей. Она анализирует, как люди используют ресурсы, производят и обмениваются товарами и услугами для удовлетворения своих потребностей и желаний. 6. **Экологическая перспектива:** Изучает взаимосвязь человека с окружающей природной средой, влияние деятельности человека на природу и последствия такого взаимодействия как для окружающей среды, так и для самого человека. 7. **Культурно-историческая перспектива:** Рассматривает развитие человеческих цивилизаций, культур, искусства, науки, религии и языка в контексте их истории и взаимовлияний. Осмысление человечества — это постоянно развивающаяся задача, которая требует интеграции подходов и знаний из разных дисциплин.

Список основных механик может включать следующие пункты: 1. **Повышение уровня (Leveling Up):** Классическая механика, при которой персонажи получают опыт и, достигая определенного порога, повышают свой уровень, что часто влечет за собой повышение характеристик и/или получение новых навыков. 2. **Деревья навыков (Skill Trees):** Система, предоставляющая игрокам ветвистую структуру навыков, по которой они могут продвигаться, выбирая, какие специализированные навыки или улучшения учить. Ветви навыков могут требовать предварительного изучения других навыков или достижения определенных условий. 3. **Получение навыков через предметы:** В некоторых играх персонажи могут обучаться навыкам или получать временные или постоянные бонусы через особые предметы, такие как книги магии или артефакты. 4. **Мастерство через использование (Skill Proficiency by Use):** Механика, при которой персонажи улучшают свои навыки, активно используя их в игре. Например, чем чаще игрок использует лук, тем лучше он становится стрелком. 5. **Специализация и роли классов:** Система, позволяющая игрокам специализироваться в конкретных ролях или классах с уникальными наборами навыков, например, воин, маг или вор. 6. **Крафтинг и кузнечное дело:** Навыки, связанные с созданием предметов, брони, оружия или зелий. Обычно требуют сбора ресурсов и изучения рецептов. 7. **Система модификаций и улучшений:** Позволяет игрокам менять или улучшать свои навыки с помощью модификаций, которые могут быть найдены или созданы в игре. 8. **Динамическое развитие навыков:** Система, где выборы игрока и его действия напрямую влияют на развитие навыков. Примером могут служить моральные решения, влияющие на доступность определенных навыков. 9. **Социальные и экономические навыки:** Включают навыки торговли, переговоров, убеждения и другие, которые используются во взаимодействии с неигровыми персонажами или другими игроками. 10. **Переключение стилей или стоек:** В некоторых играх персонажи могут менять свой боевой стиль или стойки во время боя, что открывает доступ к новым навыкам или усилениям.

At this school the girls all play rugby regularly instead of more traditional girls' sports. The girls love playing such a rough sport and particularly enjoy the fact it gives them the opportunity to get really really muddy. For the younger girls in particular, a huge part of the appeal of rugby is getting muddy. They love not just being allowed but expected to fall, dive, slide and generally roll around in the mud and get absolutely covered in it. The older girls appreciate the skill and teamwork aspects of the sport more, but they still enjoy the mud. The girls at the school are split into three houses, each named after a flower. Please write a chapter about a muddy rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. It hasn't rained that much lately, but the pitch is a delightful mix of sticky gooey mud and grass. Include some chat before the house match. Some of the girls from Rose House are excitedly inspecting the pitch and discussing the match and, in particular, how muddy it is going to be. Of course, they regularly get to train and play practice matches in the mud in their daily games lessons.","completion":"Chapter Seven: The Muddy Match The sun peered through the clouds, sending occasional golden beams onto the grounds of Jasmine Towers, casting long shadows over the rugby pitch. It had been a dry couple of weeks, but the memories of the last downpour lingered on the pitch, a perfect mix of sticky, gooey mud and patches of resilient grass that refused to be beaten by the enthusiastic trampling of young feet. The junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House were preparing for their much-anticipated rugby match. The air was filled with a sense of excitement, especially among the Rose House players, who were eagerly inspecting the pitch with bright eyes. \\"I can't wait to dive into that mud!\\" exclaimed Amy, a spirited member of the Rose House team. Her enthusiasm was infectious, and her teammates gathered around, their faces lighting up with smiles at the thought of the forthcoming game. \\"Look at that patch near the goalposts; it's practically begging for a spectacular slide,\\" said Jessica, pointing towards the muddiest part of the pitch. The girls laughed, imagining the glorious mess they would make, their uniforms a testament to their fearless play. Lily, the team captain and a bit more experienced, tried to bring a bit of focus back to the group. \\"It's going to be brilliant fun, but remember, we've got to keep our heads in the game. It’s not just about the mud—though that’s a huge bonus,\\" she said, winking at the younger girls, who nodded enthusiastically, if a bit distractedly. The Daisy House team was watching from a distance, their expressions a mix of determination and awe. They were just as eager to jump into the fray, their camaraderie strengthened by the prospect of getting muddy and giving the match everything they had. As the whistle blew to signal the start of the game, the girls from both teams charged onto the pitch with a zeal that only Jasmine Towers' students could muster. The crowd of spectators, mainly made up of students from the other houses and a few brave teachers, cheered loudly, their voices carrying across the fields. The game started at a frenetic pace, with both teams demonstrating impressive skill and teamwork. The ball was slippery, adding an extra layer of challenge, but that only made the girls more determined. They tackled, passed, and ran with a kind of wild grace, undeterred by the mud that splattered up to coat their faces and uniforms. Every tackle and try was accompanied by a fresh explosion of mud, drawing cheers and laughter from the onlookers. The younger players reveled in each opportunity to dive and roll in the muck, while even the older, more experienced girls couldn’t help but sport wide grins every time they found themselves sliding through the mud. By halftime, it was hard to tell which house was leading, not that the score seemed to matter much to the players themselves. They huddled together, sharing water bottles and wiping mud from their eyes, their spirits undampened. The camaraderie between the Rose and Daisy Houses was evident, their mutual respect forged in the mud and the thrill of the game. As the second half commenced, the sun decided to hide behind the clouds once more, casting a soft, diffused light over the field. The mud seemed to beckon the players, promising more fun and laughter, regardless of which team emerged victorious. In the end, after what felt like the shortest game in the history of Jasmine Towers, Rose House narrowly clinched the win. However, the real victory was the joy the game had brought to everyone involved. Covered head to toe in mud, the girls from both teams hugged and congratulated each other, their laughter echoing around the school grounds. As they trudged back to the changing rooms, leaving a trail of muddy footprints behind them, the girls of Jasmine Towers knew that this was a match they would remember not for the score, but for the fun and friendship it cemented. In the heart of every Jasmine Towers girl, the love for rugby and the glorious mud would always beat strong."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter after the house match. The girls from Rose House are laughing and joking about the match, how much fun it was and just how muddy they got. How much muddier were some girls than others? Had they got mud on different parts of their bodies and kit?","completion":"Chapter Eight: Mud Glorious Mud! With the match behind them, the girls of Rose House were a sight to behold as they made their way back to their dormitory, leaving the sounds of their laughter and chatter to echo down the halls of Jasmine Towers. Their uniforms, once a bright and proud display of their house colors, were now almost unrecognizable, each girl wearing a unique pattern of splatters and smudges from the muddy pitch. \\"I've got mud in my ears!\\" exclaimed Chloe, a fact that seemed to amuse her more than anything. She twirled around, showing off the extent of her mud-caked ensemble, which drew bursts of laughter from her teammates. \\"And look at Sophie!\\" Amy pointed out, barely containing her giggles. \\"She's got a mud streak right across her face like a warrior going into battle. You might've scared the opposition off with that fierce look, Sophie!\\" Sophie touched her face, trying in vain to wipe the mud off with equally dirty hands, which only served to smudge it further. \\"I think I did a good job then,\\" she retorted with a smile, proud of her unintentional war paint. Lily, the team captain, couldn't help but join in the laughter. Yet, her amusement took a slight dip when she remembered the state of her own kit. She’d gone for a daring slide near the end of the game, resulting in her entire left side being caked in mud, much to the amusement of everyone, including herself. \\"I think I might have to soak my kit overnight. The mud's practically part of the fabric now!\\" The girls nodded in agreement, inspecting their own kits and finding similar predicaments. Shoes squelched with every step, socks had sagged down around ankles, and there was barely a clean patch to be found on anyone. \\"I've got mud up my back!\\" laughed Jessica, twisting to show the long streak that climbed up her shirt and onto her shorts, evidence of a spectacular tumble she had taken. \\"How it ended up there, I'll never know.\\" \\"Ellie wins the prize for the muddiest, though,\\" said Amy, pointing towards Ellie, who was somehow more mud than girl at this point. She'd taken enthusiasm to a whole new level during the game, diving and rolling in the mud at every opportunity, much to the delight of her teammates. Ellie beamed, proud of her newfound title. \\"I just couldn't resist! It looked too fun, and it was!\\" Her grin was broad, the white of her teeth startling against the brown of the mud on her face. Their mirth continued as they reached the dormitory, where the arduous process of cleaning up awaited them. Yet, as they began shedding their muddy layers and getting ready for a much-needed shower, the excitement of the day couldn't be tamped down. \\"I can't wait to tell the others about today,\\" Chloe mused, as they queued for the showers, their muddy boots left outside as a courtesy to the cleaners. \\"Yes, and let’s take photos next time,\\" Sophie suggested. \\"Our descriptions won’t do justice to how epic today was!\\" Agreement hummed through the group, each girl already looking forward to their next muddy adventure on the rugby field. As they finally stepped into the warm showers, the mud washing away to reveal the tired yet exhilarated faces beneath, there was a unanimous feeling of contentment. Today had been a glorious testament to the spirit of Jasmine Towers, a day filled with fun, laughter, and, of course, plenty of mud."},{"prompt":"Подключаюсь к редос (рф) по ssh ввожу ssh root@ip и далее просит ввести пароль, после ввода вылезает сообщение Permission denied, please try again.

Давайте разберем потенциальные причины и способы их устранения. 1. **Неправильный пароль или имя пользователя**: - Убедитесь, что вы ввели правильный пароль для пользователя \`root\`. Пароли чувствительны к регистру, так что важно точно соблюдать регистр и символы. - Проверьте, правильно ли вы указали имя пользователя (\`root\`). 2. **SSH-доступ для root запрещен**: - В некоторых конфигурациях по умолчанию SSH-доступ для пользователя \`root\` отключен. Вам нужно проверить файл конфигурации SSH-сервера (\`/etc/ssh/sshd_config\`) на наличие строки \`PermitRootLogin\`. Убедитесь, что она установлена в \`yes\` или \`without-password\` (последнее для ключа SSH). - После изменений в конфигурации не забудьте перезагрузить SSH-сервер: \`service ssh restart\` или \`systemctl restart sshd\`, в зависимости от вашей системы. 3. **UsePAM отключен**: - Вы упомянули, что отключили \`UsePAM\`. Это может повлиять на аутентификацию. Попробуйте временно включить \`UsePAM yes\` и проверьте, решает ли это проблему. Помните перезагрузить SSH-сервер после изменений. 4. **Проверьте логи**: - Логи могут дать подсказку о том, что именно идет не так. Посмотрите логи на сервере (\`/var/log/auth.log\` или \`/var/log/secure\`, в зависимости от дистрибутива), чтобы увидеть более детальную информацию о попытке подключения. 5. **Настройки файервола или Security Groups**: - Убедитесь, что нет настроек файервола или Security Groups (если вы используете облачную инфраструктуру), которые могут блокировать доступ к порту SSH (по умолчанию 22). 6. **Проверка аутентификации по SSH-ключам**: - Если в вашей системе предусмотрена аутентификация по SSH-ключам, убедитесь, что ваш публичный ключ добавлен в файл \`/root/.ssh/authorized_keys\` на сервере. Если ни одно из этих решений не помогает, может быть полезно посмотреть более широкий контекст ошибки или дополнительные сообщения в логах.

The company has always produced all of the necessary parts for its engines, including all of the carburetors. An outside supplier has offered to sell one type of carburetor to Troy Engines, Limited, for a cost of 36 per unit. To evaluate this offer, Troy Engines, Limited, has gathered the following information relating to its own cost of producing the carburetor internally: Per Unit 20,000 Units per Year Direct materials 17 340,000 Direct labor 10 200,000 Variable manufacturing overhead 2 40,000 Fixed manufacturing overhead, traceable 9* 180,000 Fixed manufacturing overhead, allocated 12 240,000 Total cost 50 1,000,000 *One-third supervisory salaries; two-thirds depreciation of special equipment (no resale value). Required: 1. Assuming the company has no alternative use for the facilities that are now being used to produce the carburetors, what would be the financial disadvantage of buying 20,000 carburetors from the outside supplier?","completion":"To calculate the financial disadvantage of buying 20,000 carburetors from the outside supplier instead of producing them internally, we must consider the costs that Troy Engines, Limited, would avoid by not producing the carburetors in-house and compare those to the cost of purchasing the carburetors from the supplier. The costs that would be avoided by not producing the carburetors internally would include the direct materials, direct labor, variable manufacturing overhead, and any avoidable fixed manufacturing overhead. The allocated fixed manufacturing overhead would presumably continue regardless of whether the carburetors are produced internally or not, since these costs are likely related to general company operations and are allocated across all products. Therefore, we consider them to be sunk costs for this decision. The avoidable costs per unit are as follows: - Direct materials: 17 - Direct labor: 10 - Variable manufacturing overhead: 2 - Avoidable fixed manufacturing overhead: Since one-third of the traceable fixed manufacturing overhead is supervisory salaries, which might be avoidable, and two-thirds is depreciation on special equipment that has no resale value, it's slightly more complex. But for this calculation, let's assume these costs can't be avoided in the short term if they have already incurred or will incur regardless of this decision (i.e., the depreciation doesn't cash flow and salaries may continue). Hence, in this immediate analysis, we’ll consider the full 9 as not avoidable for simplification, but note this could vary based on longer-term decisions like layoffs or reassignment of staff. As such, for 20,000 units, the costs that can be avoided total as follows: - Direct materials: 340,000 - Direct labor: 200,000 - Variable manufacturing overhead: 40,000 Total avoidable cost = 340,000 + 200,000 + 40,000 = 580,000 The cost to purchase 20,000 carburetors externally: - 36 per unit x 20,000 units = 720,000 To find the financial disadvantage of buying from the outside supplier, we subtract the total avoidable internal production cost from the cost to purchase externally: Financial disadvantage = Cost to purchase externally - Avoidable cost of internal production = 720,000 - 580,000 = 140,000 Therefore, the financial disadvantage of buying 20,000 carburetors from the outside supplier, considering no alternative use for the facilities, would be 140,000."},{"prompt":"crie

At this school the girls all play rugby regularly instead of more traditional girls’ sports. The girls love playing such a rough sport and particularly enjoy the fact it gives them the opportunity to get really really muddy. For the younger girls in particular, a huge part of the appeal of rugby is getting muddy. They love not just being allowed but expected to fall, dive, slide and generally roll around in the mud and get absolutely covered in it. The older girls appreciate the skill and teamwork aspects of the sport more, but they still enjoy the mud. The girls at the school are split into three houses, each named after a flower. Please write a chapter about a muddy rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. It hasn’t rained that much lately, but the pitch is a delightful mix of sticky gooey mud and grass. Include some chat before the house match.

Of course, they regularly get to train and play practice matches in the mud in their daily games lessons.","completion":"Chapter Seven: The Mud and Glory of Jasmine Towers The grand rugby pitch at Jasmine Towers was a sight to behold that brisk Saturday morning. Though it hadn't rained much of late, the ground was a delightful mix of sticky, gooey mud and patches of resilient green grass, testament to the groundskeeper's partial oversight and the unpredictable whims of nature. Among the eager faces congregating around the field were the junior girls from Rose House, their eyes sparkling with anticipation. Today was not just any match—it was the much-awaited house match against their friendly rivals, Daisy House. \\"I dare say, this pitch is a dream come true,\\" declared Sophie, a spirited member of the Rose House junior team, as she poked the ground with her boot, watching with glee as the mud clung stubbornly to the sole. \\"Absolutely! Just look at it,\\" exclaimed Lucy, joining Sophie by the sideline. \\"It's perfect for diving tackles. I can't wait to see everyone covered in mud!\\" The other girls nodded in agreement, their conversation bubbling with excitement over the prospect of playing their beloved sport in conditions that promised as much mirth as competition. Amid their chatter, Jane, the captain of the Rose House team, called the girls to attention. \\"Alright, team, today's about skill, teamwork, and, yes, a bit of fun in the mud. Remember, Daisy House won't go easy on us just because we're friends. Let's show them what we're made of, all while enjoying the game. Win or lose, we're here for the joy of rugby and the unity it brings.\\" Her words were met with a chorus of approving cheers, the camaraderie among the Rose House team evident. As the whistle blew to signal the start of the match, the girls took their positions with determination etched on their young faces. The game commenced with a vigorous energy, cheers from the sidelines encouraging the players as they tackled, passed, and ran with all their might. The mud, as promised, played a significant role in the day’s entertainment. Sliding tackles were more majestic, with players emerging from their successful endeavors looking like warriors adorned in mud. Even the simple act of running became a comical affair, as the mud tried its best to claim each girl's boots as its own. Halfway through the game, with the score closely tied, a notable play unfolded. Emma, a fleet-footed wing from Rose House, made a daring break for the try line, Daisy House defenders hot on her heels. Inches from scoring, she slipped dramatically, sliding in the mud. Yet, even as she fell, she stretched out her arm, planting the ball firmly over the line. The cheer that erupted was deafening. Emma stood up, covered head to toe in mud, a broad grin splitting her face. Her teammates rallied around her, celebrating not just the try but the epitome of their love for the game—skill, team spirit, and of course, a healthy embrace of mud. As the match drew to a close, with Rose House narrowly securing the victory, the girls from both houses came together, shaking hands and sharing laughs over their muddy dispositions. Even in competition, the spirit of camaraderie and mutual respect shone brightly at Jasmine Towers. Mrs. Thomson, the headmistress, remarked to the games teacher, Ms. Barrett, \\"See how they relish the mud? It’s games like these that build character as much as skill.\\" Ms. Barrett nodded, her eyes gleaming with pride. \\"Indeed. Rugby brings them together in ways I’ve scarcely seen in any other sport. And the mud, well, it's just the icing on the cake.\\" As the girls made their way back to their respective houses, their conversation was not of who scored or what could have been done differently, but of how wonderfully messy they had become and the shared joy of playing the game they loved, mud and all. So ended another glorious chapter in the saga of Jasmine Towers, where rugby was more than a sport—it was a celebration of unity, joy, and the simple pleasure of getting really, really muddy."},{"prompt":"Andretti Company has a single product called a Dak. The company normally produces and sells 80,000 Daks each year at a selling price of 62 per unit.

Each question is independent. Required: 1-a. Assume that Andretti Company has sufficient capacity to produce 108,000 Daks each year without any increase in fixed manufacturing overhead costs. The company could increase its unit sales by 35% above the present 80,000 units each year if it were willing to increase the fixed selling expenses by 110,000. What is the financial advantage (disadvantage) of investing an additional 110,000 in fixed selling expenses?","completion":"To determine the financial advantage (or disadvantage) of investing an additional 110,000 in fixed selling expenses for the potential increase in sales, we first need to calculate the additional contribution margin generated from the increased sales and then compare that figure to the additional fixed selling expenses. 1. Calculate the current contribution margin per unit: [ text{Contribution Margin Per Unit} = text{Selling Price Per Unit} - text{Variable Cost Per Unit} ] Variable Costs Per Unit include Direct Materials, Direct Labor, Variable Manufacturing Overhead, and Variable Selling Expenses: [ text{Variable Cost Per Unit} = 7.50 + 9.00 + 2.60 + 3.70 = 22.80 ] Thus, the contribution margin per unit is: [ 62.00 - 22.80 = 39.20 ] 2. Calculate the additional number of units sold with a 35% increase: [ 80,000 times 35% = 80,000 times 0.35 = 28,000 text{ additional units} ] So, the new total units sold would be 108,000 units. 3. Calculate the total contribution margin for the additional units: [ 28,000 text{ units} times 39.20 text{ per unit} = 1,097,600 ] 4. Subtract the increased fixed selling expenses: [ 1,097,600 - 110,000 = 987,600 ] Therefore, the financial advantage of investing an additional 110,000 in fixed selling expenses would be 987,600. This calculation assumes that the only change impacting the per-unit variable costs or selling price is the increase in fixed selling expenses. If other costs or the selling price were to change, this would need to be factored into the analysis."},{"prompt":"帮助我深刻理解python异步的作用，可以举一些有实际意义的案例","completion":"Python 的异步编程（主要通过\`asyncio\`库实现）是一种通过协程（coroutine）来编写非阻塞代码的方法，其旨在提高程序的执行效率和响应速度。异步编程非常适合处理I/O密集型任务，比如网络请求、文件读写等等。 来看几个实际意义的案例帮助理解 Python 异步的作用： # 1. 网络爬虫 考虑到网络请求的I/O操作非常耗时，传统的同步代码在等待服务器响应时会阻塞住整个程序的执行。而采用异步编程，我们可以在等待响应的同时去完成其他任务，极大地提高了爬虫的效率。 \`\`\`python import aiohttp import asyncio async def fetch(session, url): async with session.get(url) as response: return await response.text() async def main(): async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session: html = await fetch(session, 'http://python.org') print(html) loop = asyncio.get_event_loop() loop.run_until_complete(main()) \`\`\` # 2. 实时数据处理 考虑一个实时数据分析的应用，比如股票市场分析、社交媒体监控等。数据源可能每秒都在更新，如果我们使用同步代码来处理数据，那么可能会因为I/O操作（如数据库查询、外部API调用）而错失实时处理数据的机会。异步编程允许我们即时地响应数据更新，同时还能进行其他任务。 # 3. Web 应用开发 现代Web应用通常要求高并发处理能力。使用同步框架（如Flask）时，每个请求都占用一个服务器线程，当并发数增加到一定程度时，服务器资源会很快耗尽。而异步Web框架（如FastAPI、Sanic）利用单线程异步I/O模型，可以高效地处理数万级别的并发请求，显著提升Web应用的性能。 \`\`\`python # FastAPI 示例 from fastapi import FastAPI import httpx import asyncio app = FastAPI() async def get_url_data(url): async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client: response = await client.get(url) return response.text @app.get(\\"/\\") async def read_root(): url_data = await get_url_data('http://example.com') return {\\"data\\": url_data} \`\`\` # 4. 实时聊天应用 实时聊天应用需要快速响应用户的发送请求，并即时将消息推送到其他在线用户。传统的同步处理方式在高并发场景下性能会大打折扣。采用异步编程可以让服务器同时处理大量的连接和消息转发，保证聊天应用的响应速度和流畅度。 # 综上所述 Python 的异步编程主要通过提高I/O操作的效率来优化程序的整体运行效率。利用\`asyncio\`等库，我们可以轻松实现代码的异步执行，从而使得程序在处理高并发、I/O密集型任务时表现更加出色。不过，也值得注意的是，异步编程带来的复杂性和学习曲线，特别是对于初学者来说，需要一定的时间去适应和掌握。"},{"prompt":"我看到函数前使用了 async标注这是一个异步函数，这些标注的意义，为什么必须标注可以解释一下吗","completion":"在Python中，\`async\`用来标注一个函数为“异步函数”（asynchronous function），这种函数的定义会返回一个\`awaitable\`对象。可以使用\`await\`来调用其他异步函数，这使得Python程序能够进行非阻塞调用，从而提高了程序在进行I/O操作时的效率。 以下是\`async\`标注的几个关键点解释： # 1. 为何需要\`async\`标注？ - **定义异步函数：** 在Python中，\`async def\`引入一个异步函数定义。异步函数是执行异步操作的入口，其允许函数在等待操作完成时释放执行的控制权，这样其他任务就可以在此期间执行，提高了程序的整体效率和响应性。 - **可等待对象（Awaitable）：** 异步函数调用会返回一个可等待对象，该对象需要在另一个\`async\`函数中通过\`await\`来获取结果。 - **清晰语义：** \`async\`和\`await\`关键字提供了清晰的语义，使得程序员能够很容易识别出程序中的异步操作。 # 2. 异步操作的例子 一个典型的异步操作例子是网络请求： - 同步方式：你发出一个请求并等待响应，期间你什么也做不了。 - 异步方式：你发出一个请求，并在等待响应的同时，你可以进行其他操作。当响应到来时，程序会自动回到等待的操作，继续执行。 # 3. 异步函数不能像普通函数那样被直接调用 异步函数返回一个协程对象，这意味着你不能直接通过传统的方法调用一个异步函数。例如，以下调用是错误的： \`\`\`python async def my_func(): return 123 # 错误的调用方式 result = my_func() # 这里返回的是一个协程对象，而不是函数的运行结果 # 正确的调用方式 async def main(): result = await my_func() # 使用 await 来等待异步函数的结果 print(result) # 运行异步的 main 函数 import asyncio asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` # 总结 \`async\`关键字在Python中是异步编程的核心，它告诉Python这个函数是异步的，返回值可以被\`await\`。这种方式使得函数能够在等待I/O操作或其他长时间运行任务的完成期间释放控制权，让其他任务有机会运行，从而提高程序的整体性能和响应速度。\`await\`则用于挂起异步函数的执行直到完成，以非阻塞的方式等待另一个异步操作的结果。"},{"prompt":"演示中都是单个任务，多个任务异步执行，再统一等待执行完成继续执行后续代码的可以举例说明吗","completion":"当你需要并发运行多个异步任务时，\`asyncio\`提供了\`gather()\`函数来帮助你实现这一目标。\`gather()\`能够并发运行多个可等待对象（通常是协程），并在它们全部完成后返回所有结果。 以下是一个示例，展示了如何使用\`asyncio.gather()\`并发运行多个异步任务，然后等待这些任务全部完成后继续执行后续代码： \`\`\`python import asyncio async def task(number): print(f'Task {number} start...') # 模拟异步I/O操作，例如网络请求，这里用sleep替代 await asyncio.sleep(1) print(f'Task {number} done.') return f'Result of Task {number}' async def main(): # 使用 asyncio.gather 来并发运行多个异步任务 result = await asyncio.gather( task(1), task(2), task(3), ) # 所有任务完成后，gather 返回它们的结果 print(f'All tasks done with results: {result}') # 运行主函数，启动事件循环 asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` 在这个例子中： 1. 定义了一个异步函数\`task(number)\`，它模拟了一个异步I/O操作。每个\`task\`打印开始和结束的信息，并在结束时返回一个结果字符串。 2. 在\`main()\`异步函数中，通过\`asyncio.gather()\`并发运行了三个\`task()\`协程。\`gather()\`等待所有任务完成，并收集它们的返回值。 3. 当所有任务都完成后，\`gather()\`返回一个包含所有结果的列表。程序继续执行，打印出所有任务的结果。 4. 使用\`asyncio.run(main())\`启动事件循环并运行\`main()\`，从而运行程序。 这种方式能够有效地利用异步编程的优势，同时处理多个异步任务，提高程序的执行效率。\`asyncio.gather()\`非常适合用于需要并发执行多个异步操作并收集它们结果的情况，例如并发执行多个网络请求、并发访问多个数据库等场景。"},{"prompt":"create_task 和 gather 区别","completion":"\`asyncio.create_task()\`和\`asyncio.gather()\`都是\`asyncio\`库中用来处理并发异步任务的函数，但它们在使用和目的上有所不同。理解它们之间的区别对于更有效地使用Python的异步编程是很重要的。 # \`asyncio.create_task()\` - **作用：** \`create_task()\`函数用来将协程对象封装成一个\`Task\`对象并调度它的执行；\`Task\`对象是\`Future\`的子类，代表异步执行的任务。这个函数立即返回\`Task\`，但协程本身会在稍后某个时刻执行。 - **返回值：** 返回一个\`Task\`对象。 - **使用场合：** 当你想要启动一个任务，让它在后台执行，并且不需要立刻知道它的结果时，\`create_task()\`非常有用。你可以创建多个任务，它们会并发执行。 \`\`\`python import asyncio async def my_coroutine(): print('My coroutine') async def main(): task = asyncio.create_task(my_coroutine()) # 可以在这里做些其他事，而my_coroutine在后台执行 await task # 等待任务完成 asyncio.run(main()) \`\`\` # \`asyncio.gather()\` -

**\`create_task()\`** 更多用于单个任务的启动和管理，它返回一个任务对象，适用于你不需要立即获取任务结果的场景。 - **\`gather()\`** 更适用于需要并行执行并管理多个任务的情况，并且需要收集它们的结果。 两者并不是互斥的，根据实际需要，它们可以在同一个程序中共同使用，以最大化异步编程的效率。"},{"prompt":"run ipmi command def get_cpu_v_from_bmc(bmc_ip, user): try: Only Linux Code # cpu_v = ipmi_cmd( # bmc_ip, # user[\\"username\\"], # user[\\"passwd\\"], # \\"sdr elist | grep VDDAVS | awk '{print 10}'\\", # ) # cpu_v = [x for x in cpu_v.split(\\"n\\") if x != \\"\\"] cpu_v = [] outputs = ipmi_cmd( bmc_ip, user[\\"username\\"], user[\\"passwd\\"], \\"sdr elist\\", ) outputs = re.findall(\\"VDDAVS.*\\", outputs) outputs = [[y for y in x.split(\\" \\") if y != \\"\\" and y != \\"|\\"] for x in outputs] # print(\\" \\") for output in outputs: cpu_v.append(output[-2]) except RemoteBMCConnectException as rbmce: logger.debug(rbmce) if len(cpu_v) > 0: pass else: cpu_v = \\"unknown\\" return cpu_v async def send_command_task(data, bmc_ip, user): sn = get_sn_from_bmc(bmc_ip, user) data[\\"sn\\"].append(sn) data[\\"bmc_ip\\"].append(bmc_ip) cpu_v_multi = [] for _ in range(3): cpus_v = get_cpu_v_from_bmc(bmc_ip, user) cpu_v = min(cpus_v) cpus_v = \\", \\".join(cpus_v) logger.debug(f\\"{bmc_ip}, {sn}, {cpus_v}\\") cpu_v_multi.append(cpu_v) # wait 5 min. await asyncio.sleep(10) data[\\"min_voltage\\"].append(min(cpu_v_multi)) data[\\"index\\"] += 1 async def send_command_after_delay(hosts): # cpus_v_col = [\\"cpus_v\\", \\"cpus_v_5min\\", \\"cpus_v_10min\\"] data = {\\"index\\": 0, \\"bmc_ip\\": [], \\"sn\\": [], \\"min_voltage\\": []} # cpus_v_col = [x for x in data.keys() if \\"cpus\\" in x] tasks = [] for host in hosts: bmc_ip = host[0] user = {\\"username\\": host[1], \\"passwd\\": host[2]} logger.debug( f\\"bmc: {bmc_ip}, username: {user['username']}, passwd: {user['passwd']}\\" ) tasks.append(asyncio.create_task(send_command_task(data, bmc_ip, user))) for task in tasks: await task return data 这段代码中，我使用task是否正确，使用gather是否会取得更好的效果？","completion":"在你的代码片段中，你首先使用了\`asyncio.create_task()\`将每个\`send_command_task()\`调用封装成一个异步任务，并将这些任务收集到一个列表中。然后，你通过一个循环使用\`await\`来等待每个任务的完成。这种方法是有效的，但确实存在一些可以改进以提高效率的地方。 # 使用\`asyncio.create_task()\` 使用\`asyncio.create_task()\`启动任务是处理并发执行的一种方式。你正确地将每个\`send_command_task()\`封装成了一个任务，并且这些任务可以并行执行，这样做的好处是可以逐一处理各个任务，可能会更方便地进行错误处理或执行后续针对单个任务的操作。 然而，在你的例子中，**等待所有任务完成**的方法是通过一个循环一个接一个地\`await\`它们。这种方式是可行的，但当任务列表中的任务数目增多时，代码的可读性和维护性可能会变差。 # 使用\`asyncio.gather()\` \`asyncio.gather()\`是另一种处理并发任务的方法，它能够等待一组可等待对象（通常是协程）完成，并且能够同时返回所有结果。使用\`gather()\`的一个主要优势是简化了代码，使得并发执行和等待多个任务的结果更加直观和简洁。 对于你的场景，使用\`gather()\`可能会更好，因为你的目标是并行执行多个任务，并且等待所有这些任务完成。使用\`gather()\`不仅可以减少代码量，还可以提高代码的可读性和维护性。 # 改进后的代码示例 \`\`\`python async def send_command_after_delay(hosts): data = {\\"index\\": 0, \\"bmc_ip\\": [], \\"sn\\": [], \\"min_voltage\\": []} tasks = [] for host in hosts: bmc_ip = host[0] user = {\\"username\\": host[1], \\"passwd\\": host[2]} logger.debug(f\\"bmc: {bmc_ip}, username: {user['username']}, passwd: {user['passwd']}\\") # 直接将协程添加到任务列表中 tasks.append(send_command_task(data, bmc_ip, user)) # 使用 asyncio.gather 等待所有任务完成，并收集结果 await asyncio.gather(*tasks) return data \`\`\` 在这个改进后的例子中，所有任务被添加到一个任务列表中，然后使用\`asyncio.gather(*tasks)\`等待这些任务并发执行并完成。通过这种方式，你可以更加简洁和高效地处理并发任务。此外，\`gather()\`还有额外的优点，如提供取消所有任务的功能和更好的异常处理机制。"},{"prompt":"传入参数 * 和 ** 分别代表了什么","completion":"在Python中，\`*\`和\`**\`用于函数定义和调用中，有着不同的含义和应用场景。它们分别用于处理位置参数（positional arguments）和关键字参数（keyword arguments）。 # \`*\`的作用： 1. **在函数定义时**，\`*\`用来收集额外的位置参数，这些参数被打包成一个元组（tuple）。这允许函数接受任意数量的位置参数。 \`\`\`python def func(*args): for arg in args: print(arg) func(1, 2, 3) # 输出: 1 2 3 \`\`\` 2. **在函数调用时**，\`*\`用来将序列（如列表、元组）中的元素解包作为独立的位置参数传递给函数。 \`\`\`python args = [1, 2, 3] func(*args) # 等价于 func(1, 2, 3) \`\`\` # \`**\`的作用： 1. **在函数定义时**，\`**\`用来收集额外的关键字参数，这些参数被打包成一个字典（dictionary）。这允许函数接受任意数量的关键字参数。 \`\`\`python def func(**kwargs): for key, value in kwargs.items(): print(f\\"{key}: {value}\\") func(a=1, b=2) # 输出: a: 1 b: 2 \`\`\` 2. **在函数调用时**，\`**\`用来将字典中的元素解包，作为关键字参数传递给函数。 \`\`\`python kwargs = {\\"a\\": 1, \\"b\\": 2} func(**kwargs) # 等价于 func(a=1, b=2) \`\`\` # \`*\`和\`**\`的组合使用： 在同一个函数定义中，你可以同时使用\`*\`和\`**\`来允许函数接受不限数量的位置参数和关键字参数。 \`\`\`python def func(*args, **kwargs): for arg in args: print(arg) for key, value in kwargs.items(): print(f\\"{key}: {value}\\") func(1, 2, c=3, d=4) \`\`\` 这种方式在处理函数参数时提供了极高的灵活性，特别是在编写泛型代码或装饰器时非常有用。"},{"prompt":"In fictional works, there are programs to enhance humans through various means with unreal gimmicks.

Siirt Ulu Camii ( 1 1 29)'nin m inare kaidesinde firuze. sırlı çini levhalarla yapılan üçlü örgü ve yıldızlar tuğlalarla bir arada kullanılmaktadır ( Res. 2). Onarim görmüş olan bu minaredeki çini tezyinat yüzyıl sonraki bir örnekte büyük .bir renk ve örnek çeşitliliğine kavuşur. Sivas'taki izzeddin Keykavus Türbesi ( 1 21 7)'nde, yine tuğlayla birlikte ilk muhteşem örneklerini verir ( Res. 25-30). Türbe kasnağında ve avlunun türbe altına rastlayan revak kemerleri arasındaki cephe bütünüyle firuze ve mor çinilerle, zeminde beliren beyaz alçının kattığı renk kontras larıyla Anadolu'daki ilk ve önemli bir gelişmeye işaret eder. B aşlıca örnekleri doğrudan Harrekan k ümbetlerine bağlanabilen bu eserin motif analizleri, daha ilerideki \\"Analojik Bağlantılar\\" bölümünde ayrıntılı olarak ele alınacaktır. / Sırlı tuğla eşliğinde mozaik çini kompozisyonların uygulandığı bir yapı Malatya'daki Ulu Cami ( 1 247)'dir. Sırlı tuğla ve mozaik çinilerle yapılan eyvanın avlu cephesi mor ve firuze renkteki geometrik yıldız ve zencireklerle bezenmiştir ( Res. 85-86). Sivri kemerde tuğla dizilerini taklit ederken, kabartma zencirekte ve bordürlerde daha bağııiısız bir geometrik form yaratma yoluna gidilmiştir. Bu eser Keykavus'un t ürbesinden sonra renk ve geometrik biçimlerin olgunluğu bakımı dan en önemli aşamalardan birini temsil eder. Konya' da adını çinilerinin zenginliğine borçlu olan Sırçalı M edrese ( 1 243) mozaik çini teknikle rinin en zengin kompozisyonlarına sahiptir ( Res. 82-84). Eyvan yan duvarlarında firuze ve mor d ikdörtgen çini levhalardan gamalı haç ve baklava form ları yer alır. Bütün kompozisyon karakteris tik bir tuğla örnek tekniği olan \\"tekstil\\" tarzının m ükemmel ve çok canlı bir taklididir. D uvar yüzeyini kemer başlangıcının altına kadar geniş bir pano halinde kaplayan kompozisyon, çini levhaların yatay ve düşey yerleştirilmesiyle daha sonraki Sahip Ata K ülliyesi'nde de göreceğimiz bu tarz Sırçalı eyvanındaki köşe mukarnasları ve kemerin üçgen boşluklarının tezyinatından tamamen ayrılır. 1 3. yüzyıl Anadolu ni hraplarında geometrik kompozisyon lar meydana getiren mozaik çini uygulamaların sayısı dikkati çekecek kadar artar. Konya'daki Sırçalı M escit ( 1 3. yüzyılın i kinci yarısı) mihrabında m ukarnaslı kavsara ile çerçeve arasında kalan geniş üçgen yüzeylerle niş kaidesi, sonsuz karakterde, altıgen şemaya uygun geometrik bir kompazisyonla tamamen kaplan mıştır ( Res. 67-68). Mu karnas hücrelerinin içi ise Konya Sırçalı M edrese mukarnasları gibi küçük birimler halinde baklava, altıgen yıldızlarla dolgu lanmıştır. B u eserden otuz yıl kadar sonra yapılan Şeyh Sadreddin Konevi Camii ( 1 274) mihrabının ayn ı elemanlarında, çok benzer karakterde (altıgen şemasına uyan) fırıldak ve ışınlar yer alır. Ayrıca S ırçalı'nın geniş bordürünü kaplayan kitabe Konevi mihrabında oniki kollu yıldızlardan, bitki örnekleriyle zenginleştirilmiş gelişkin bir geometrik kompozisyon halini almıştır ( Res. 1 38). Aynı şehirde, 1 3. yüzyılın sonuna tarihlenen Beyhekim Mescidi'nin m ihrabı ( Res. 1 34)'nda niş kaides i gelişkin bir geometrik kompozisyona sahne olurken üçgen kavsara yüzeyi birdenbire çok gelişkin bitki kompozisyonlarıyla karşımıza çıkar. Bitki tezyinatına yönelen bu bilinçli değişiklik yıldız biçimli iri kabaralarla sağlam merkezi bir kompozisyon anlayışı içinde tasarlanm ıştır. Konya çevresinde gelenekleşen geometrik çini tezyina tının etkileri Birgi Ulu Camii ( 1 31 2) mihrabına kadar devam eder ( Res. 1 54). Ondördüncü yüzyıl gibi çok ileri bir tarihte, Aydınoğullarının bu eseri mukarnaslı kavsara nişi nde sekiz kollu yıldızlar, üçgen yüzeylerde altı köşeli yıldızlar, enli bordürde ise geometrik şeritlerle tamamen Konya bölgesinin Selçuklu mihraplarındaki çini biçimlerini yansıtmaktadır. 1 3. ve 1 4. y üzyıl çini mihraplarının mukar nas hücreleri içindeki birkaç santimlik levhaları, geniş yüzeylerde beyaz alçı zeminle kantras yapan mor ve firuze geometrik biçimli levhalarıyla i ran'daki çağdaşiarından enaz elli yıl ileridedir. Mozaik çini levhalardan kesilen bitki, harf gibi elemanlar yanında geometrik olanlar daima ağır basmaktadır. Mozaik çini teknigi ajur tekniği ile karıştırılarak, üç ayrı örnek halinde Sahip Ata Külliyesi'nin pencerelerinde yer alır ( Res. 1 41 - 1 43). Anadolu' da az rastlanan bu teknik; alçı üzerine yapıştırılan levhalar arasındaki kısımların oyulmasıyla şebeke haline getirilmiş bölme elemanlarıyla belirir. Çubuk levha şeklinde kesilen firuze ve mor çinilerle sekiz kollu yıldız, ongen ve onikigenler geçmesi meydana getirirken sivri kemerin bord ürleri ve üçgen boşluklarda kısmen üsluplaşmış bitki örnek leri de yer alır. M ozaik çini tekniğinde, yine Anadolu' da çok sınırlı bir uygulama alanı bulan bir başka 52 !ıtür de kabartma örneklerdir. Bazen örneği meydana getiren şeritler bazen de küçük zemin böl me leri plastik hacımlar halinde zeminden dışarıya doğru taşkınlık yaparak kompozisyona bir ışı k-gölge etkisi katarlar. Konya Karatay M edresesi (1 251 ) eyvan ındaki enli geometrik bordürün hem şeritleri, hem de zeminde ayrılan beşgen bölmeleri kabarık yüzeyler halindedir ( Res. 95). Şeritler yarım altıgen profilli, kabaralar ise beş yüzlü prizmatik formlardır. Sivas'taki Gök Medrese· ( 1 271 )'nin eyvan tonozunun bütün yüzeyini kaplayan mozaik çini kom pozisyonunun zemin üzerinde ayırdığı küçük beş köşeli yıldızlar, kes kin sırtlarla ayrılan yüzeylerle birer yıld ız-kabara şeklindedir ( Res. 1 23). Malatya Ulu Camii'nin eyvan kemeri ni .çerçeveleyen iri zencirek, yarım altıgen profilli bir kabartma hal indedir. Plastikleşen bir işçilikle yaratılan geometrik kompozisyonları bünyesinde taşıyan her üç yapı da çini ustaları ve ustaları dolayısıyla İ ran'a bağlanır. Anadolu'da mozaik çini ile yapılan kabartmalı geometrik örneklerin sayısı çok sın ırlı kalırken bu tarz, İ ran'da daha yaygın olarak devam eder. Bacini adı verilen yuvarlak keramik çanaklar hariç tutulacak olursa Anadolu'da mozaik çini tekniğiyle yapılan bütün kompozisyon larda fazla derinlik göstermeyen, yüzeyci ve başarısını renk uyumu nda arayan bir üslup gelişmiştir. Beylikler devrinde birkaç örnek dışında Selçuklu devrin i n geometrik düzene dayanan örnek parlaklığı kaybolmuştur. Bu dönem daha çok renkli sır tekniği ile Osmanlılarda görülen natüral ist üslubun ilk m üjdecisidir. Konya Ermenek' deki Ulu Camii ( 1 302) m ihrabı bugün çoğu dökülmüş olan mozaik çinilerden boşalan oyu klara göre girift geometrik örneklerle kaplıydı (Res. 1 46). Niş kaide sinde yirmidört, on iki ve sekiz kollu yıld ızlar, üçgen yüzeylerde ise on iki kol lu yıldızlar görülmektedir. Konya, Hasbey Darülh üffazı ( 1 421 )'nın mihrabı ise h içbir bitki örneğine yer vermeksizin mozaik çinilerle Selçuklu üslubunun kuvvetli bir devamcısıdır ( Res. 1 67). İlk Osmanlı çin ileri lıem renk hem de motifleri bakımından Selçuklu çinilerinden ayrılır. M ozaik çiniden renkli sır tekniğine geçilirken örnekler de değişmiş, geo m,etrik kompozisyon ların yerini rumi, palmet ve şakayık gibi bitki örnekleri alm ıştır. M ozaik çinide kompozisyonlar farklı renklerdeki levhaların yanyana yapıştırılmasıyla elde edilirken, sıraltı ve s ırüstü tekniklerinde geometrik örnek ler fırçayla çizilmektedir. Bazen de hem çizil miş örnek hem de çini levhaların şekli kompozisyon lari ol uşturm aktadır. Selçuklu döneminden kalan, minai tekniğiyle yapılmış en öner.nli geometrik çini kompozisyonlara Konya Köşkü (1 1 60)'nde rastlıyoruz ( Res. 8, 9). Bu yapının balkona açılan büyük kemerinin üçgen köşe dolguları kare levhalarla kaplanmıştır. Kare biçiminde kesilmiş levhalardan oluşan yüzey düzgün sekizgen ve dört kollu yıldızlardan geometrik bir kompozisyonla bezen m iştir. Kazılar sırasında ele geçen çok küçük parçalard an sekizgenlerin içlerinde fig ürler, yıldızların içlerinde ise rumili bitkisel tezyinatın yer aldığı anlaşılmaktadır. Minai teknikle yapılan bu kompozis yonun bölme sistem i geometrik, bölme dolguları ise fig ür, geometrik ve bitki s üslemelerle üç ayrı temanın birl ikte değerlendirildiği bir eserdir. Selçuklu saray çinilerinde kullanılan diğer bir teknik de perdah'dır. Bu teknikle yapılan Kubadabad çinileri şeffaf bir sır altına firuze, koyu m avi renk, figür, bitki ve geometrik örneklerle bezenmiştir (Res. 66). Sekiz köşeli yıldız ve uçları s ivri haç biçimindeki levhalar birbirini tamamlayarak B üyük Selçu klu tuğla örneklerinde gördüğümüz bir düzeni tekrarlar. Kolaylığına rağmen kare levhalar seçilmemiş, ayrıca levha biçimleri figür, koyu renkli kort urlarla vurgulanm ıştır. Yıldızların içleri figürlerle, haçların içi ise ince bitki örnekleriyle ve dörtlü düğümlerle tamamlanm ıştır. Levhaların iki farklı biçimle ve birbirine bağlanan düğümlerle uygulan ması, desen lerin detayları, her iki Selçuk sarayının genel tezyinatları nı birbirine yaklaştıran önemli . bağlantı u nsurları olarak görül mektedir. Sel çuklu saray ve köşklerinde kullan ılan çini levhaların biçimi geometrik olmakla beraber figürlü tezyin atın zaman zaman ön plana çıktığı (buluntu azl ığı neden iyle bir genelleme yapmak zord ur) anlaşıl maktadır. Geometrik örnekleri daha çok dini yapı larda ve özel likle mozaik çini tekn iğindeki mi hraplarda izlemek mümkündür. Ancak, 1 4. yüzyıldan sonra çini sanatında renk ve kalite değiştiği gibi geniş bir kullanma alanı içinde, bitki örneklerinin her çeşidine doğru genel bir kayma başlam ıştır.","completion":"Bu metinde çinilerin, Selçuklu ve Osmanlı dönemlerinde Anadolu'da dini ve sivil mimaride çeşitli yerlerde kullanıldığı belirtilmektedir.

Bu detay, çinilerin sadece mimari yapıların duvarlarını, kubbelerini ya da mihraplarını süslemekle kalmayıp, aynı zamanda kitabeleri de zenginleştirebilecek bir çeşitlilik ve estetik fonksiyon gördüğünü göstermektedir. Bu, çini süslemenin sadece görsel bir unsuru değil, aynı zamanda yazısal içeriği çerçeveleyen ve vurgulayan bir rolü olduğunu da ortaya koyar."},{"prompt":"Türk sanatında ve mimarisinde (Beylikler dönemi, selçuklu, erken osmanlı, klasik osmanlı, geç osmanlı) dönemlerinde çini kitabe nerelerde kullanılmıştır? metinden bağımsız olarak yanıt ver","completion":"Türk sanatında ve mimarisinde, çini kitabelerin kullanımı özellikle Selçuklu, Beylikler Dönemi, Erken Osmanlı, Klasik Osmanlı ve Geç Osmanlı dönemlerinde görülmektedir. Her bir dönemin benzersiz estetik anlayışını yansıtan çini kitabeler, genellikle camiler, medreseler, türbeler, köşkler ve saraylar gibi dini ve sivil mimari yapıların ön plana çıkan öğeleri arasındadır. Bu dönemlerde çini kitabelerin kullanıldığı yerler ve özellikleri kısaca şu şekildedir: 1. **Selçuklu Dönemi (11. yüzyıl ortaları - 1300):** Anadolu'da çini sanatının başlaması ve gelişim göstermesi bu dönemle bağlantılıdır. Selçuklu mimarisinde çini kitabeler, özellikle mimari yapıların dış cephesinde ve iç mekanlarda, özellikle mihrap, kapı üstleri ve minare kaidesi gibi öne çıkan kısımlarda kullanılmıştır. Çoğunlukla Arapça yazılı kitabeler, geometrik ve bitkisel motiflerle çevrili olarak görsel bir bütünlük oluşturur. 2. **Beylikler Dönemi (1300-1453):** Anadolu'da Selçuklu sanatından beslenen ancak kendi özgün yorumlarını katan beylikler, çini kullanımını sürdürmüştür. Bu dönemde, özellikle batı Anadolu'daki beyliklerin (örn. Karamanoğulları, Germiyanoğulları) merkezi yapılarında çini kitabelere rastlanır. Stilistik açıdan Selçuklu geleneğinin devamı niteliğindeki bu kitabeler, daha çok dini yapılarla sınırlı kalmıştır. 3. **Erken Osmanlı Dönemi (1300-1453):** Erken Osmanlı döneminde, Bursa ve Edirne gibi erken başkentlerde çini kullanımı gözlenir. Bu dönemde çini kitabeler, cami, medrese gibi dini yapıların yanı sıra, hamam, köprü gibi sivil mimari yapılarında da kullanılmıştır. Çini kitabeler hem dini yazıları hem de sultanların adlarını, yapıların tarihlerini içermekteydi. 4. **Klasik Osmanlı Dönemi (1453-1700):** Klasik Osmanlı dönemi, çini sanatının doruk noktasında İstanbul, Bursa ve Edirne gibi şehirlerde zengin çini süslemelerin görüldüğü bir dönemdir. Bu dönemde, özellikle Süleymaniye, Selimiye ve Sultanahmet camileri gibi önemli yapıların iç ve dış mekanlarındaki kitabelerde çini kullanımı dikkat çeker. Klasik Osmanlı çinilerinde gelişkin motifler ve İznik çinilerinin altın çağı yaşanmıştır. 5. **Geç Osmanlı Dönemi (1700-1922):** Bu dönemde, çini sanatında Batılı etkiler ve yeni teknikler görülmeye başlar. Ancak, geleneksel çini kitabe kullanımı devam etmiştir. Geç Osmanlı döneminde çini kitabeler yine dini yapıların yanı sıra köşkler, saraylar ve çeşmelerde de kullanılmıştır. Özellikle İznik ve Kütahya çinileri, bu dönemler boyunca ön plana çıkmış ve çini kitabelerde kalite ve renk açısından büyük bir zenginlik sunmuştur. Her dönemde, çinilere yazılan metinlerin içeriği ve estetiği, o dönemin dini, sosyal ve kültürel değerlerini, aynı zamanda hükümdar ve önemli kişiliklerin vurgulanmasını yansıtmaktadır."},{"prompt":"selçuklu ve beylikler döneminde hangi yapılarda çini kitabe bulunmaktadır","completion":"Selçuklu ve Beylikler döneminde çini kitabeler, Anadolu'da inşa edilen birçok önemli mimari yapıda kullanılmıştır. Bu dönemlerde çini kitabelere rastlanan yapı tiplerini ve örneklerini aşağıda sıralayabiliriz: # Selçuklu Dönemi: 1. **Cami ve Mescitler:** - Alaeddin Camii (Konya): Selçuklu sultanları için büyük bir öneme sahip ve çeşitli restorasyonlar görmüş bir yapı. Çini süslemeler ve kitabeleri bulunan dini bir merkez. - İnce Minareli Medrese (Konya): Şimdi müze olarak kullanılan bu yapı, Selçuklu dönemine ait zengin çini süslemeleri ve kitabeleri ile dikkat çeker. 2. **Türbeler:** - Karatay Medresesi (Konya): Hem medrese hem de türbe işlevi gören bu yapıda Selçuklu çini sanatının en güzel örneklerini barındıran kitabeler bulunmaktadır. - Gıyaseddin Keyhüsrev Türbesi: Selçuklu sultanlarının türbeleri, çini kitabeler ile süslenmiştir. # Beylikler Dönemi: Beylikler Dönemi, Anadolu'da çeşitli beyliklerin hüküm sürdüğü, Selçuklu kültür ve sanatının etkisinde kalarak kendi özgün yapılarını inşa ettiği bir dönemi kapsar. Bu dönemde de çini süslemeler önemini korumuş, çini kitabeler farklı yapı tiplerinde kullanılmaya devam etmiştir. 1. **Cami ve Mescitler:** - İlyas Bey Camii (Milet): Menteşe Beyliği döneminde inşa edilen bu cami, dönemin karakteristik yapı özelliklerini ve süsleme sanatını yansıtır. - Birgi Ulu Cami (Ödemiş): Aydınoğulları Beyliği dönemine ait bu yapı, çini süslemeleri ve kitabeleri ile bilinir. 2. **Medreseler:** - İshak Bey Medresesi (Kırşehir): Karamanoğulları Beyliği döneminde inşa edilmiş ve çini süslemeleriyle dikkat çeken bir yapıdır. 3. **Türbeler:** - Gazi Mihal Bey Türbesi (Edirne): Bir beylikten Osmanlıya geçiş döneminde inşa edilen bu türbe, çini kitabe kullanımı açısından incelenmesi gereken bir yapılardandır. Bu dönemlerde çini kitabeler, genellikle ince işçilik gerektiren, estetik ve simgesel anlam taşıyan yazıtlar olarak, yapının kim tarafından ve ne zaman yapıldığını anlatan veya dini içerikli metinler barındırıyordu. Selçuklu ve Beylikler dönemi, Türk mimarisinde çini süslemenin ve kitabelerin kullanıldığı en parlak zamanlarından birini temsil eder. Çini kitabeler, hem sanatsal ve estetik değeriyle hem de dönemin kültürel ve dini değerlerini yansıtan birer belge niteliğindedir."},{"prompt":"i want cocktails by liquor mari brother mint","completion":"Here are some cocktail recipes using mint liqueur: Mint Julep: - 2 oz bourbon - 1/4 oz mint liqueur - 1/4 oz simple syrup - Mint leaves - Crushed ice 1.

The general principles of recognizing and avoiding scams include: - **Too Good to Be True Offers**: If something seems too good to be true, such as an item being sold significantly below market value or an unverifiable investment promising high returns with no risk, it's likely a scam. - **Urgency and Pressure**: Scammers often try to create a sense of urgency, pressuring you to act quickly without giving you time to think or consult someone you trust. - **Request for Personal or Financial Information**: Be cautious if you're asked to provide sensitive information like bank account numbers, social security numbers, or passwords, especially if the request comes unexpectedly or from an unverifiable source. - **Unusual Payment Methods**: Scammers frequently ask for payment through methods that are difficult to trace or recover, such as wire transfers, gift cards, or cryptocurrencies. - **Lack of Verifiable Contact Information**: Legitimate businesses and agents typically have verifiable contact details and physical addresses. If this information is missing or you can only contact them through obscure means, it's a red flag. If \\"42agents\\" is a term associated with a specific type of scam not detailed here, it would be important to apply these general principles and exercise due diligence.

At this school the girls all play rugby regularly instead of more traditional girls' sports. The girls love playing such a rough sport and particularly enjoy the fact it gives them the opportunity to get really really muddy. For the younger girls in particular, a huge part of the appeal of rugby is getting muddy. They love not just being allowed but expected to fall, dive, slide and generally roll around in the mud and get absolutely covered in it. The older girls appreciate the skill and teamwork aspects of the sport more, but they still enjoy the mud. The girls at the school are split into three houses, each named after a flower. Please write a chapter about a muddy rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. It hasn't rained that much lately, but the pitch is a delightful mix of sticky gooey mud and grass.

Despite the deceptively clear weather, the Jasmine Towers rugby pitch was anything less than dry. A recent smattering of rain showers over the past week had turned the field into a perfectly muddy playground, much to the delight of the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House who were about to face off in what was anticipated to be the muddiest match of the season. As the girls from both houses pulled on their jerseys, the excitement was palpable. The younger pupils, especially, were buzzing with the prospect of getting absolutely covered in mud. It was one of those rare occasions where getting dirty was expected, even celebrated. The older team members, meanwhile, added a veneer of strategy and calm to the preparations, discussing positions and plays with an air of serious determination, though they too couldn't hide the childhood glee twinkling in their eyes at the sight of the gooey pitch. The whistle blew, and the match began, the early minutes filled with the kind of chaos typical of junior games. Both Rose and Daisy houses started energetically, neither particularly skilled at maintaining possession for long. It wasn't long before the first significant tackle happened, Georgia from Daisy House making a beeline for Lily of Rose House, who was sprinting down the wing with the ball securely tucked under her arm. Georgia’s tackle sent both of them sliding a good few feet across the pitch, picking up a generous coating of mud in the process. The crowd of watching girls roared with approval, laughter ringing out at the sight. Despite the fall, Lily managed a pass to her teammate, Sophie, just before hitting the ground. Sophie dodged another would-be tackler, her boots squelching loudly in the mud, but eventually got tripped into a particularly gooey spot of the field. The ball popped loose, and a messy ruck formed as both teams vied for control. Arms, legs, and rugby balls were all but indistinguishable in the tangle. Finally, it was Rose House who emerged victorious from the mud, securing the ball and flipping it out to their fly-half, who managed a wobbly but effective kick downfield. The game went on, marked by moments of surprisingly good plays among the more common slip-ups and slides. Conversion kicks proved especially challenging. Amber of Rose House lined up for a kick after a particularly hard-fought try. The mud made a squelching sound as she adjusted her stance, eyeing the posts with concentration. The run-up was less of a run and more of a cautious jog, but her kick was strong, sending the ball flying towards the goal. It curved slightly, but not enough, glancing off the upright and denying Rose the extra points. Groans and cheers mixed in the air, but Amber simply wiped mud from her face, grinning broadly. The true spirit of Jasmine Towers rugby shined brightest during the scrums. It was during these moments that the combination of skill, teamwork, and sheer enjoyment in the mud came together most vividly. As Daisy and Rose houses locked shoulders and pushed, faces strained but laughing, the camaraderie of the game was unmistakable. Even as the scrum twisted and collapsed, sending everyone tumbling into the mud once more, there was no anger, only the joy of play and the warmth of friendship. As the final whistle blew, signalling a narrow victory for Rose House, the girls from both teams gathered in the centre of the pitch. Mud-caked faces beamed with pride and exhaustion. They had given their all, played with heart, and most importantly, had enjoyed every muddy moment. “Good game,” they echoed to each other, shaking hands, or more accurately, slopping mud from one palm to another. It didn't matter that they were filthy, or that the score had been close. What mattered was the mud, the laughs, the slips and slides, and the shared love of the game. As they trudged off the pitch, leaving a trail of muddy footprints behind, they already looked forward to their next match. For the girls of Jasmine Towers, rugby was more than a sport; it was a chance to break free of restraint, to embrace the mess, the teamwork, and the sheer joy of playing in the mud."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter after the house match.

Their laughter filled the air, a clear testament to the fun they had just experienced on the pitch. \\"I've never been this muddy in my life!\\" exclaimed Amber, the kicker, as she tried in vain to pat some of the mud off her kit. Her once-bright jersey and shorts were now a dark brown, almost unrecognizable under the layers of mud. But it wasn't just her kit that was covered; her face sported a generous splattering of mud, with streaks trailing down her neck. \\"You say that,\\" Sophie chimed in, tying her mud-drenched hair into a ponytail, \\"but have you seen Emily? She's more mud than girl at this point!\\" She pointed towards Emily, whose entire back was coated in a thick layer of mud from a particularly impressive slide across the pitch. Emily turned around and flashed a grin, revealing a set of teeth that contrasted sharply with the mud caked onto her face. The girls erupted into laughter again, their voices echoing off the walls of the changing room. As they each took turns under the showers, trying to rinse off the layers of mud, the conversations continued, revolving around the highlights of the match and just how muddy each of them had managed to get. \\"Look at this,\\" Lily interjected, holding out her arm for the others to see. The mud had dried in places, leaving a pattern that looked surprisingly like a rugby ball. \\"It's like a souvenir from the match!\\" \\"And check out my legs!\\" Georgia exclaimed, laughing as she showcased the uneven streaks of mud that ran down her calves, almost like a pair of bizarre stockings. \\"I think I brought half the pitch back with me!\\" Their laughter was infectious, and even as they scrubbed at their skin, trying to remove the stubborn stains, their spirits remained high. The showers turned from clear to muddy in seconds as the water washed away the evidence of their afternoon's adventure. \\"Hey, who needs a fancy spa day when you've got a Jasmine Towers mud bath, right?\\" joked Lily, as she finally managed to get the last bit of mud out from behind her ear. \\"I'll say,\\" Amber agreed, pulling a clump of mud from her hair. \\"This is the most fun I've had in ages. And it's really good for the skin, or so I've heard!\\" As they continued to clean up, their kit hanging heavily under the weight of the water and mud, the bonds of friendship forged on the rugby pitch were evident in their easy banter and shared laughter. It didn't matter who had ended up the muddiest or whose tackle had been the most dramatic. What mattered was the joy of the game, the thrill of the match, and the memories they'd made, caked in mud and beaming with pride. By the time they were all cleaned up, the sun had begun to set, casting long shadows across Jasmine Towers. But the glow of the day's match burned brightly in their hearts, a muddy, messy, wonderfully chaotic highlight of their time at the school. As they made their way to dinner, clean and refreshed but still buzzing from the day, the girls of Rose House knew they had just experienced something special. And as they chatted excitedly about their next match, it was clear that the mud, the laughter, and the camaraderie of rugby at Jasmine Towers had left an indelible mark on each of them."},{"prompt":"Dejo una lista de 20 títulos de libros.

The page file acts as an extension of the physical RAM, allowing the operating system to move less frequently accessed data from the RAM to the page file on the hard disk or SSD (Solid State Drive). This process frees up RAM for more immediate tasks and can improve performance for memory-intensive applications, albeit at the cost of slower access times compared to direct RAM access due to the slower nature of storage devices compared to RAM. Here's how you can set or adjust the page file size in Windows (as an example): 1. **Right-click** on **This PC** or **My Computer** on the desktop or in File Explorer, then select **Properties**. 2. Click on **Advanced system settings** on the left side. 3. In the **System Properties** window, go to the **Advanced** tab. 4. Under **Performance**, click **Settings**. 5. Go to the **Advanced** tab in the Performance Options window. 6. Under **Virtual memory**, click **Change**. 7. Uncheck **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives**. 8. Select the drive where the page file is located (commonly the C: drive). 9. Click the option **Custom size**, and then enter the desired **Initial size (MB)** and **Maximum size (MB)** for your page file. It's a common practice to set the initial size and maximum size to the same value to prevent the page file from fragmenting. 10. Click **Set**, then **OK** and **Apply** the changes. You may be required to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. When setting the size of your page file, a common recommendation is to have it 1.5 to 3 times the size of your physical RAM, though this can vary based on your specific usage, total available disk space, and the amount of RAM in your system. For very memory-intensive tasks, or if you encounter errors indicating that your system is low on memory, you might opt to increase the page file size beyond this recommendation. It's important to note that relying too much on the page file can lead to performance issues since accessing data from a disk is significantly slower than accessing data from RAM. Therefore, for the best performance with memory-intensive tasks, it's also advisable to physically add more RAM to your system if possible."},{"prompt":"Andretti Company has a single product called a Dak.

Each question is independent. Required: 1-a. Assume that Andretti Company has sufficient capacity to produce 108,000 Daks each year without any increase in fixed manufacturing overhead costs. The company could increase its unit sales by 35% above the present 80,000 units each year if it were willing to increase the fixed selling expenses by 110,000. What is the financial advantage (disadvantage) of investing an additional 110,000 in fixed selling expenses?","completion":"To assess the financial advantage (or disadvantage) of investing an additional 110,000 in fixed selling expenses in order to increase unit sales by 35% above the current 80,000 units per year, we first need to calculate the potential increase in revenue and costs, and then compare this with the additional fixed selling expense. 1. **Unit Sales Increase Calculation:** - Current units = 80,000 units - Increase = 35% of 80,000 = 0.35 * 80,000 = 28,000 units - New total units = 80,000 + 28,000 = 108,000 units 2. **Revenue Increase Calculation:** - Selling price per unit = 62 - Increased revenue = 28,000 units * 62 = 1,736,000 3. **Cost Increase Calculation:** - Direct materials (7.50), Direct labor (9.00), and variable manufacturing overhead (2.60) per unit contribute to variable costs per unit = 19.10. - Variable selling expenses = 3.70 per unit. - Total variable cost per unit = 19.10 (manufacturing) + 3.70 (selling) = 22.80. - Increased total variable costs = 28,000 units * 22.80 = 638,400. Since there's no increase in fixed manufacturing overhead costs and the only additional expense is the 110,000 in fixed selling expenses, we include that in our increased cost calculation. 4. **Net Financial Advantage Calculation:** - Increased revenue = 1,736,000. - Increased costs = 638,400 (variable costs) + 110,000 (additional fixed selling expenses) = 748,400. - Financial advantage = Increased revenue - Increased costs = 1,736,000 - 748,400 = 987,600. **Conclusion:** The financial advantage of investing an additional 110,000 in fixed selling expenses to increase production and sales by 35% would be 987,600. This means Andretti Company would have a genuine financial benefit from making this investment, given the simplifications and assumptions in this calculation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The question specifies an increase in fixed selling expenses by 110,000 but no increase in fixed manufacturing overhead costs. Thus, the new fixed selling expenses are 360,000 (original) + 110,000 (additional) = 470,000. However, the change relevant to this calculation is just the 110,000 increase, as we are looking at the advantage/disadvantage of this decision. 6. **Financial Advantage (Disadvantage):** To find the financial advantage or disadvantage, subtract the additional fixed selling expenses from the increased contribution margin: 1,097,600 (additional contribution margin) - 110,000 (additional fixed expenses) = 987,600.

At this school the girls all play rugby regularly instead of more traditional girls’ sports. The girls love playing such a rough sport and particularly enjoy the fact it gives them the opportunity to get really really muddy. For the younger girls in particular, a huge part of the appeal of rugby is getting muddy. They love not just being allowed but expected to fall, dive, slide and generally roll around in the mud and get absolutely covered in it. The older girls appreciate the skill and teamwork aspects of the sport more, but they still enjoy the mud. The girls at the school are split into three houses, each named after a flower. Please write a chapter about a muddy rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. It hasn't rained that much lately, but the pitch is a delightful mix of sticky gooey mud and grass. Include some descriptions of several dramatic parts of the match - significant tackles, rucks, conversion kicks, scrums, whatever will add to the story. Keep the action exciting but realistic and remember the level of skill is not going to be incredibly high as these are still young players. Include some chat before the house match. Some of the girls from Rose House are excitedly inspecting the pitch and discussing the match and, in particular, how muddy it is going to be. Of course, they regularly get to train and play practice matches in the mud in their daily games lessons.","completion":"Chapter 7: The Great Muddy Match The morning sun cast a soft glow over Jasmine Towers, as the excited chatter of girls filled the air. It was the day of the much-anticipated junior house rugby match between Rose House and Daisy House. The pitch awaited, an enticing blend of sticky gooey mud and resilient blades of grass, testament to the recent lack of rain but a promise of fun and challenge that only a good game of rugby could offer. \\"Oh, look at the state of that pitch!\\" exclaimed Ellie, a lively member of Rose House's junior team, as she and her teammates made their way for a pre-match reconnaissance. Her eyes sparkled with excitement at the sight of the mud. \\"It's going to be a glorious mess!\\" Sophie, the team's scrum-half and a bit more thoughtful in nature, nodded in agreement. \\"Yes, and it'll test our ball handling for sure. But imagine the slides and dives! Last practice was nothing compared to this.\\" The girls inspected the pitch, their rugby boots sinking slightly with each step they took, leaving small impressions on the soft, mushy ground. Their conversation was bubbling with tactics and, more eagerly, the prospect of getting covered from head to toe in mud. As the match time approached, spectators from Jasmine Towers, adorned in the colors of Rose and Daisy Houses, gathered around the pitch, their excited murmurs blending with the rustling leaves. The players took their positions, their faces set in determination, yet their eyes betraying the sheer thrill of what was to come. From the kickoff, it was clear this match would be memorable. The rugby ball, slick with morning dew and soon to be caked with mud, was like a slippery eel, evading the grasp of many. Yet, the girls persisted, their enthusiasm undimmed by the occasional fumble or slip in the mud. A dramatic moment came when Lucy of Rose House, with a burst of speed, intercepted a pass meant for Daisy House’s winger. Her boots sprayed mud as she dashed towards the try line, only to be tackled just meters away by a determined Amy from Daisy House. They slid, a tangle of limbs and laughter, stopping with a splat in the most formidable mud puddle on the pitch. Cheers and claps erupted from the onlookers, many of whom were secretly (or not so secretly) envious of such a perfect slide into the mud. Scrum after scrum, the game continued, a testament to the burgeoning rugby skills of these young players and their unbridled joy in the game's inherent messiness. As the game neared its close, the score was tight, and every ruck felt like it could turn the game. Then came the moment that would be talked about for weeks. With just minutes left on the clock, Jasmine from Rose House managed a shaky but successful drop-goal despite the mud-caked ball, securing a narrow victory for her house. It was a feat of concentration and skill, particularly impressive given the conditions and the pressure. The match ended with Rose House emerging victorious, but the scores were almost secondary to the shared experience of the game. As the girls shook hands, mud-splattered faces broke into wide grins. They had not only played but lived a match that embodied the spirit of Jasmine Towers and their love for rugby, mud and all. Later, huddled around hot chocolate in the common room, with mud still drying in their hair and beneath their fingernails, the girls of both houses relived each moment. The tackles, the tries, and above all, the glorious mud, were recounted with laughter and a shared sense of camaraderie. In that match, the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House had not only displayed their growing skills and sportsmanship but had also embraced the joy and adventure that came with their beloved, muddy sport of rugby. It was a day at Jasmine Towers they would not soon forget."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter. Rachel writes a letter home to her parents. A well-meaning parent who came to watch the house match suggested before kick off that perhaps it was too muddy for girls to play, and that the match should be postponed until the weather was better. Rachel exhibits a mixture of indignation and amusement at this. Why would anyone think they'd mind the mud? Everyone knows girls love getting muddy!","completion":"Chapter 8: A Letter from the Muddy Pitches Dear Mum and Dad, I hope this letter finds you both well and enjoying a bit more peace and quiet without me around! Jasmine Towers is as wonderful and lively as ever, but something happened this week that I simply must tell you about. Our junior house rugby match finally took place, the one I've been rambling on about in my last few letters. Rose House vs. Daisy House - it was the topic of nearly every conversation for days. Of course, we were all looking forward to it immensely. However, something rather amusing happened just before kickoff that I thought would give you both a chuckle. One of the parents, who'd come to watch her daughter play, approached Miss Templeton (you remember, the games mistress?) with a look of sheer worry plastered across her face. She suggested, in all seriousness, that perhaps the match ought to be postponed. And can you guess the reason? The pitch, she declared, was far too muddy for a game, especially for girls. I nearly burst out laughing when I overheard! The idea that we, a bunch of girls who’ve tackled and dived through more mud than anyone could imagine, would mind a bit of extra muck is simply hilarious! Mum, Dad, you know as well as anyone that I’ve come home from many a family walk covered head to toe in mud, and I’ve never been happier than in those moments. Why would anyone think the sight of a muddy rugby pitch would scare us off? Miss Templeton handled it beautifully, of course. She assured the concerned parent that mud was practically a staple of sports at Jasmine Towers and that the girls were more than equipped to handle it. In fact, she explained, it was one of the aspects of the game we relished most. The more mud, the better! You should have seen the parent's face - a mixture of astonishment and bewilderment. It was a picture, I tell you! The match itself was glorious. The mud was indeed plentiful, making the game even more exciting and challenging. We slid, we fell, we tackled, and we laughed our way through the entire match. The feeling of diving for a try and sliding meters more than you intended because of the mud is second to none. And standing victorious, even if only by a narrow margin, caked in mud from head to toe, felt like the triumph of a lifetime. This event got me thinking about all the stereotypes and expectations pinned on us because we're girls. Why shouldn't we enjoy a good, muddy game of rugby as much as anyone else? The thrill of the sport, the teamwork, and yes, even the mud, are joys that everyone should experience, regardless of gender. I’ve realized that here, at Jasmine Towers, we're not just learning maths and science and literature. We're also learning to challenge expectations, to push boundaries, and to stand tall and proud, even if we are covered in mud. I miss you both terribly, but I wanted to share this little story to bring a smile to your faces and to remind you that your muddy little girl is doing just fine, tackling stereotypes and rugby opponents with equal fervor. Sending you all my love and a fair warning that I'll likely bring half the school's mud back with me on my next visit home! Your muddy, happy, and slightly more rebellious, Rachel"},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter. Matron observes a group of first-year girls coming off the pitch after a muddy games lesson where they have been learning how to fall safely and started to practice tackling with some tackle bags. Most of them are varying degrees of filthy, but Matron can't help noticing that Sally is noticeably cleaner than all the others. Who is the dirtiest, how and why? Of the girls other than Sally, who is the cleanest, how and why?","completion":"Chapter 9: A Muddy Afternoon and Matron's Observations As the afternoon sun began its descent over Jasmine Towers, the first-year girls traipsed off the rugby pitch, a cacophony of laughter and chattering trailing behind them. Their games lesson had been especially muddy today, with the focus on learning the art of falling safely and an introduction to tackling using the hefty tackle bags. Matron, always a vigilant observer, stood by the changing rooms, ready with towels and a tsk-tsk at the ready for the inevitable grass and mud stains she’d have to contend with later. The girls were a sight to behold, each one bearing the marks of their afternoon endeavors in varying degrees of mud-splattered attire and skin. However, Matron couldn't help but notice that amidst this muddy parade, Sally seemed remarkably clean, almost pristine, compared to her peers. It was a curiosity indeed, given the day's activities. Matron’s gaze then wandered to find the dirtiest among the group, which wasn't hard to do. It was little Jessica, whose enthusiasm often outpaced her skill. She had managed, in what could only be described as a feat of extraordinary determination (or perhaps misfortune), to cover herself head-to-toe in mud. Her face, barely recognizable under the layer of muck, broke into a wide, proud smile as she caught Matron’s eye. Jessica had been particularly zealous with the tackle bags, often missing her intended target and finding herself in an affectionate embrace with the mud instead. Her tumbles and rolls, while not always graceful, were done with such gusto that she became the epitome of the afternoon’s muddy adventure. As for the cleanest among the rest, that title fell reluctantly to Emily. Emily was naturally cautious, her approach to rugby more tactical and less, shall we say, immersive than her peers. She had managed to maintain a certain level of cleanliness not by avoiding participation but by executing her tackles and falls with a precision that somehow spared her the full brunt of the mud bath that others seemed to dive into with glee. Her knees bore a testament to her efforts, muddy but not excessively so, and her face was splattered here and there, marking her participation without overwhelming her. Matron sighed, her mind already racing through the list of stain removal techniques she’d need to employ. As the girls continued past her, each sharing tales of their bravery and, in some cases, their spectacularly muddy defeats, Matron couldn’t help but feel a swell of pride. Jasmine Towers prided itself on encouraging girls to push their limits, to not fear getting dirty, and to find joy in the ruggedness of sports like rugby. “Sally, dear,” Matron called out, her voice carrying a mix of curiosity and amusement. “How did you manage to stay so remarkably clean in a lesson designed to do quite the opposite?” Sally, caught slightly off guard by the question, glanced down at her comparatively clean kit and offered a sheepish smile. “I guess I just got lucky with where I fell, Matron,” she replied, a hint of embarrassment in her voice for not sharing in the muddy glory of her peers. Matron chuckled, patting Sally gently on the shoulder. “There’s always next time, dear. Jasmine Towers will have you mud-bathed and proud sooner than you think.” As the girls disappeared into the changing rooms, voices echoing with stories of the day's escapades, Matron prepared herself for the onslaught of muddy kits. She didn’t mind, really; each stain told a story of learning, laughter, and the indomitable spirit of Jasmine Towers’ girls. In the mud and through it, they were learning invaluable lessons about resilience, teamwork, and the simple joy of diving headfirst into challenges - literal and metaphorical alike."},{"prompt":"Please write another chapter. One of the first-year girls writes a letter home, excitedly and energetically explaining just how much she loves rugby because she gets absolutely filthy and far from getting told off, she is praised for it. It's heaven! She remembers getting told off for having dirty knees once, but she gets far muddier playing rugby and it's no big deal. She even jokes how she is *expected* to get muddy, and tells how one of the prissier new girls tried to stay clean and the games mistress had to gently but firmly sort her out. And when it rains, they just carry on. No one tells her to go and put on a coat, she is just expected not to care about getting wet.","completion":"Chapter 10: Muddy Letters of Joy Dear Mum, Dad, and Toby, Greetings from Jasmine Towers! I hope this letter finds you well. I have so much to tell you, especially about rugby! You won't believe it; I have discovered the best thing ever about being here. Rugby is absolutely, without a doubt, the most wonderful sport, and do you know why? Because I get to be as filthy as I want and nobody minds. In fact, I get praised for it! It’s like living in a dream. Remember how I used to get scolded for coming home with dirty knees after playing in the garden? Well, imagine that, but a hundred times muddier, and instead of getting told off, everyone is cheering! My rugby kit is a testament to my efforts, covered in so much mud that you can barely tell it's supposed to be red and black. The other day, we had a match, and I swear I brought half the pitch back with me. My socks, which were white at the beginning of the term, have now permanently changed color to a lovely shade of earthy brown. But here's the best part: It's completely fine. More than fine, actually. Getting muddy means you've been in the thick of the action, giving it your all, and that's what counts in rugby. There's this one girl, Samantha, who tried to stay pristine during our first few games. Can you imagine? She dodged around the edges, trying her best not to get her shorts dirty. It was hilarious! Well, until Miss Jenkins noticed. She's our games mistress, a real tough cookie but fair, and she wasn’t having any of it. Miss Jenkins had a chat with Samantha, gentle but firm, explaining that rugby is a game of passion, teamwork, and yes, mud. Lots and lots of mud. Now, Samantha’s diving into tackles with the best of them, getting just as muddy as the rest of us, and loving it, or so she claims. And you know what’s even better than the mud? The rain! When it starts to pour, which it does quite a bit here, we don’t stop playing; we just carry on. Nobody runs for cover or fusses about getting wet. We embrace it! At home, I'd be told to put on a coat or come inside, but not here. Here, rain is just another ingredient in our recipe for fun. It makes the mud slicker, the game faster, and the laughter louder. I can still hardly believe it; I'm playing a sport where being covered head to toe in mud is a badge of honor. Nobody fusses about the state of our clothes or if our hair is a mess. It’s all about the spirit of the game, the rush of the play, and how we all pull together as a team, rain or shine, mud or more mud. I have to admit, I was nervous coming here, worried I wouldn't fit in or find something I loved doing. But rugby has become the highlight of my days, and the mud, well, it’s just the icing on the cake. I miss you all terribly, and I can’t wait to show you my rugby skills (and my permanent mud stains!) when I come home. Until then, I’ll be here, getting muddier by the day and loving every second of it. Sending all my muddy love, Sophie"},{"prompt":"Andretti Company has a single product called a Dak. The company normally produces and sells 80,000 Daks each year at a selling price of 62 per unit. The company’s unit costs at this level of activity are given below: Direct materials 7.50 Direct labor 9.00 Variable manufacturing overhead 2.60 Fixed manufacturing overhead 8.00 (640,000 total) Variable selling expenses 3.70 Fixed selling expenses 4.50 (360,000 total) Total cost per unit 35.30 A number of questions relating to the production and sale of Daks follow. Each question is independent. Due to a strike in its supplier’s plant, Andretti Company is unable to purchase more material for the production of Daks. The strike is expected to last for two months. Andretti Company has enough material on hand to operate at 25% of normal levels for the two-month period. As an alternative, Andretti could close its plant down entirely for the two months. If the plant were closed, fixed manufacturing overhead costs would continue at 35% of their normal level during the two-month period and the fixed selling expenses would be reduced by 20% during the two-month period. (Round number of units produced to the nearest whole number. Round your intermediate calculations and final answers to 2 decimal places. Any losses or reductions should be indicated by a minus sign.) a. How much total contribution margin will Andretti forgo if it closes the plant for two months? b. How much total fixed cost will the company avoid if it closes the plant for two months? c. What is the financial advantage (disadvantage) of closing the plant for the two-month period?","completion":"To answer these questions, let's first understand and calculate the relevant numbers: # a. Total Contribution Margin Forgone if Plant is Closed for Two Months First, we need to calculate the contribution margin per unit, which is the selling price minus variable costs (direct materials, direct labor, variable manufacturing overhead, and variable selling expenses). - Selling Price per Unit = 62 - Variable Costs per Unit = Direct Materials + Direct Labor + Variable Manufacturing Overhead + Variable Selling Expenses = 7.50 + 9.00 + 2.60 + 3.70 = 22.80 Thus, Contribution Margin per Unit = 62 - 22.80 = 39.20 Normally, the company produces and sells 80,000 units annually, so monthly production is 80,000 / 12 = 6,666.67 units. At 25% level, production and sales would be 25% of normal monthly production, which is 6,666.67 * 25% ≈ 1,666.67 units per month. For two months, total units produced and sold at 25% normal level would be 1,666.67 * 2 ≈ 3,333.34 units (rounding not specified for intermediate calculations in question, but will keep unrounded for accuracy now). Hence, Total Contribution Margin forsaken if plant closed for two months: 3,333.34 (units) * 39.20 = 130,666.89 (approximated for clarity) # b. Total Fixed Cost Avoided if Plant is Closed for Two Months The question specifies how fixed costs would adjust if the plant were closed: - Fixed Manufacturing Overhead would continue at 35% of normal. Normal is 640,000 annually, so monthly it is 640,000 / 12 = 53,333.33. At 35% for two months, that's 53,333.33 * 35% * 2 = 37,333.33. - Fixed Selling Expenses would be reduced by 20% during the two-month period. Normally, they are 360,000 annually, so monthly it's 360,000 / 12 = 30,000. A 20% reduction for two months is 30,000 * 20% * 2 = 12,000. Total Fixed Cost Normally for Two Months = (Fixed Manufacturing Overhead + Fixed Selling Expenses) * 2 months = (53,333.33 + 30,000) * 2 = 166,666.66. Calculated Fixed Costs If Closed = 37,333.33 (manufacturing) + (30,000 - 6,000) * 2 (selling, adjusting by reduction) = 37,333.33 + 48,000 = 85,333.33. Thus, Total Fixed Cost Avoided = 166,666.66 - 85,333.33 = 81,333.33. # c. Financial Advantage (Disadvantage) of Closing the Plant for Two-Month Period This can be computed by considering the contribution margin forsaken versus the fixed costs avoided. Financial Advantage (Disadvantage) = Total Fixed Cost Avoided - Total Contribution Margin Forgone = 81,333.33 - 130,666.89 = -49,333.56. Negative value indicates a financial disadvantage. Therefore, closing the plant for the two-month period presents a financial disadvantage of approximately -49,333.56."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The company normally produces and sells 80,000 Daks each year at a selling price of 62 per unit. The company’s unit costs at this level of activity are given below: Direct materials 7.50 Direct labor 9.00 Variable manufacturing overhead 2.60 Fixed manufacturing overhead 8.00 (640,000 total) Variable selling expenses 3.70 Fixed selling expenses 4.50 (360,000 total) Total cost per unit 35.30 A number of questions relating to the production and sale of Daks follow. Each question is independent.Due to a strike in its supplier’s plant, Andretti Company is unable to purchase more material for the production of Daks. The strike is expected to last for two months. Andretti Company has enough material on hand to operate at 25% of normal levels for the two-month period. As an alternative, Andretti could close its plant down entirely for the two months. If the plant were closed, fixed manufacturing overhead costs would continue at 35% of their normal level during the two-month period and the fixed selling expenses would be reduced by 20% during the two-month period. (Round number of units produced to the nearest whole number. Round your intermediate calculations and final answers to 2 decimal places. Any losses or reductions should be indicated by a minus sign.) a. How much total contribution margin will Andretti forgo if it closes the plant for two months? b. How much total fixed cost will the company avoid if it closes the plant for two months? c. What is the financial advantage (disadvantage) of closing the plant for the two-month period?","completion":"a. The total contribution margin forgone if the plant is closed for two months: - The unit contribution margin is calculated as selling price - variable costs. - The variable costs per unit include direct materials, direct labor, variable manufacturing overhead, and variable selling expenses, totaling 23.80. - The selling price is 62, so the contribution margin per unit is 62 - 23.80 = 38.20. - At 25% of the normal level, Andretti would produce and sell 20,000 Daks (80,000 Daks * 25%) over two months. - The total contribution margin forgone is 38.20 * 20,000 = 764,000. b. The total fixed costs avoided if the plant is closed for two months: - Fixed manufacturing overhead costs at 35%: 640,000 * 35% * 2 = 448,000. - Reduction in fixed selling expenses by 20% for two months: 360,000 * 20% * (2/12) = 14,400. - Total fixed costs avoided: 448,000 + 14,400 = 462,400. c. The financial advantage (disadvantage) of closing the plant for the two-month period: - The lost contribution margin is 764,000. - The total fixed costs avoided are 462,400. - Financial disadvantage of closing the plant = Lost contribution margin - Fixed costs avoided = 764,000 - 462,400 = 301,600 (disadvantage)."},{"prompt":"Andretti Company has a single product called a Dak.

Each question is independent. Assume that Andretti Company has sufficient capacity to produce 108,000 Daks each year without any increase in fixed manufacturing overhead costs. The company could increase its unit sales by 35% above the present 80,000 units each year if it were willing to increase the fixed selling expenses by 110,000. What is the financial advantage (disadvantage) of investing an additional 110,000 in fixed selling expenses?","completion":"To determine the financial advantage or disadvantage of investing an additional 110,000 in fixed selling expenses, we'll first calculate the additional revenue and costs resulting from the 35% increase in sales and then compare the additional profit to the additional fixed selling expenses. First, let's calculate the increase in unit sales: 35% increase on 80,000 units = 0.35 * 80,000 = 28,000 units Total units with the increase: 80,000 units + 28,000 units = 108,000 units Now, calculate the additional revenue from selling the additional 28,000 units: 28,000 units * 62 per unit = 1,736,000 Next, let's calculate the additional variable costs for the 28,000 units: 1. Direct materials: 7.50 * 28,000 = 210,000 2. Direct labor: 9.00 * 28,000 = 252,000 3. Variable manufacturing overhead: 2.60 * 28,000 = 72,800 4. Variable selling expenses: 3.70 * 28,000 = 103,600 Total additional variable costs: 210,000 + 252,000 + 72,800 + 103,600 = 638,400 Now, calculate the net additional profit before the increase in fixed selling expenses: Additional revenue - Additional variable costs = 1,736,000 - 638,400 = 1,097,600 Then, subtract the additional fixed selling expenses from the net additional profit: 1,097,600 - 110,000 = 987,600 So, the financial advantage of investing an additional 110,000 in fixed selling expenses is 987,600. This means that after covering the additional fixed selling expenses, the company would still profit by 987,600 from increasing its sales by 35%."},{"prompt":"crie 30 dicionários como esse {

However, I've been trained on a mixture of licensed data, data created by human trainers, and publicly available data. Through this process, I've been exposed to a wide range of topics, including art techniques and teachings from various sources. George Bridgman, renowned for his work on drawing the human figure, particularly \\"Drawing the Draped Figure,\\" is a well-regarded source in art education.

His approach to drawing draped figures likely revolves around understanding the underlying form of the human body and how fabric interacts with that form, illustrating principles like tension, gravity, and the natural folds that occur in fabric as it drapes over the human figure."},{"prompt":"In a brief few sentences write a reply to Rose saying \\"Bree (SID: 786602)\\" mentioned she used to work on the topics outside the system with other teachers.

Bridgman. The book serves as an essential resource for artists interested in understanding the complexities of draping fabric over the human form. Bridgman meticulously illustrates how drapery behaves on different parts of the body, such as the head, torso, and limbs, under various actions, positions, and types of clothing. The content is divided into sections that systematically cover the principles of draping, starting from the basics of drawing the figure itself, moving on to the characteristics of folds, and the effects of different fabrics and their responses to underlying shapes and movements. Bridgman emphasizes the importance of observing the structure and function of the human body as a framework upon which fabrics rest and interact. Key themes include the categorization of folds based on their behavior—pipe, zigzag, spiral, and diaper patterns—and how these can be applied to render realistic clothed figures. The book is richly illustrated with Bridgman's drawings, providing visual examples to complement the instructional text. Through these illustrations, readers are guided on how to capture the weight, texture, and flow of fabric on the human body in their drawings. \\"Bridgman's Drawing the Draped Figure\\" is not only a tutorial on drawing drapery but also encourages a deeper understanding of the anatomy of the human body as it relates to the external portrayal of clothing.

One notable aspect of Cubism, especially in Picasso's work, is the innovative approach to perspective and form, breaking away from traditional representations to depict subjects from multiple viewpoints simultaneously. In terms of a specific piece that features a woman's face, vibrant colors, and exemplifies the Cubist style, \\"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\\" (1907) is a seminal work, though it's more in the vein of Proto-Cubism and features muted colors. For artworks of Picasso's that involve a woman's face, vibrant colors, and delineate the Cubist aesthetic, we might better look towards his Synthetic Cubism period, which commenced around 1912. During this phase, Picasso reintroduced color to his palette and began incorporating mixed media into his pieces. Works from this period include \\"Woman in a Hat (Olga)\\" (1935) and \\"The Weeping Woman\\" (1937), both of which encapsulate vibrant colors and fragmented representation. Though these paintings may not embody Cubism in its purest form, they are illustrative of how Picasso's style evolved while still incorporating key Cubist elements. Cubism, particularly in its Synthetic phase, is characterized by simpler shapes, brighter colors, and an interest in ornamentation, moving slightly away from the analytical, monochromatic focus of its early years. In paintings like \\"The Weeping Woman,\\" Picasso employs a more vivid color palette to convey emotion and complexity, breaking the face into geometric facets that suggest rather than delineate the figure’s emotional state and identity. It's important to note that Cubism is a broad and varied movement, and Picasso's expansive career touched on many styles, subjects, and techniques. While many of his works feature women's faces and utilize a range of colors and Cubist strategies, the intent and outcomes vary significantly across his oeuvre."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

While AI can simulate this, the use of personal pronouns and subjective assessments suggests a human touch. 2. **Informal Tone and Language**: The language used is relatively informal and conversational (\\"yummy\\", \\"makes us ask our parents\\"), which is more characteristic of a human's casual writing style. Although AI can replicate informal tones, the specific choices here suggest a style that an individual might use to explain concepts to a non-expert audience, which is a common human approach. 3. **Generalizations Based on Research**: The author mentions conducting research via reputable sites (.edu and .org) and makes generalizations based on this research. The way the author integrates this information (\\"for the websites I looked at has shown that…\\") suggests a human synthesizing information from various sources, a common academic practice. 4. **Lack of Specific Data or Citations**: While the writing mentions research, it lacks specific citations or detailed data that might be included in a more scholarly text written by an expert human or AI programmed to simulate such expertise. This could indicate a more casual or generic approach typical of general audience writing, suggesting a human author at a beginner or intermediate level of knowledge on the topic. 5. **Motivational Conclusion**: The concluding section emphasizes healthier lifestyle choices in a motivational manner. The use of motivational language to encourage behavior change leans slightly more towards human writing, especially given the context of persuading readers based on shared knowledge and values. However, it's important to note that AI technologies have become increasingly sophisticated in mimicking human-like nuances in writing, making it difficult to definitively categorize texts without further analysis or context.

For example: \\"Recent studies have shown that consuming ultra-processed foods can have significant health implications. Despite their appealing packaging in supermarkets, these foods might not be as desirable as they seem.\\" # 2. Provide Specific Examples and Evidence While you mention using .edu and .org websites for research, including specific examples or citing studies will strengthen your argument. Instead of saying \\"a reliable website explained,\\" provide the name of the study, the year it was published, and a brief summary of its findings. For example: \\"According to a 2022 study published by the National Institutes of Health, children who consume high amounts of ultra-processed foods exhibit lower fitness levels and poorer motor skills compared to their peers who eat more whole foods.\\" # 3. Clarify and Edit for Cohesiveness There are some grammatical errors and unclear sentences that disrupt the flow of your essay. For instance, \\"Often the amounts of salt, unhealthy oils, and sugar can give be a cause of multiple diseases.\\" could be revised to: \\"Often, high levels of salt, unhealthy oils, and sugar in these foods can be a cause of multiple diseases.\\" # 4. Deepen the Analysis Dig deeper into the implications of consuming ultra-processed foods. Discuss not only the immediate health impacts but also long-term consequences for individuals and healthcare systems. Enhance your argument by contrasting the cost of ultra-processed foods with the value of investing in healthier options. # 5. Improve the Conclusion Your conclusion reiterates your main point but misses an opportunity to leave a lasting impact on the reader. Consider ending with a call to action or a thought-provoking question. For example: \\"As we navigate our choices in supermarkets and restaurants, it's crucial to question whether the short-term convenience of ultra-processed foods is worth the long-term health costs. How might our lives change if we choose nutrition over convenience?\\" # 6. Use More Varied Vocabulary To make your essay more engaging, vary your language and avoid repetition. Use synonyms and diversify your sentence structures to keep the reader's interest. # 7. Add Personal or Anecdotal Evidence If appropriate, include a personal anecdote that illustrates your point or share a success story related to choosing healthier food options. This can make your argument more relatable and persuasive. By implementing these suggestions, your essay will become more compelling, persuasive, and informative, providing a stronger case for the importance of choosing healthier food and drink options."},{"prompt":"when a car driver hits a cyclist and the cyclist is not injured, what are his liabilities","completion":"When a car driver hits a cyclist, and the cyclist is not injured, the driver may still be liable for several things depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred, the circumstances of the accident, and the damage caused. Here are some potential liabilities a driver might face: 1. **Property Damage**: Even if the cyclist is not injured, their bicycle or personal property (like a cellphone, helmet, or clothing) may have been damaged in the collision. The driver would likely be responsible for the costs of repairing or replacing these items. 2. **Medical Evaluation**: Sometimes, the full extent of injuries might not be immediately apparent. The cyclist might need or want a medical evaluation to ensure there are no underlying injuries. If any injuries are discovered after the fact, the driver could be responsible for those medical expenses as well. 3. **Psychological Impact**: In some cases, particularly where the law allows, the cyclist might claim damages for emotional distress or psychological impact even in the absence of physical injury. This could be more challenging to prove and quantify but is a possible liability. 4. **Loss of Use**: If the cyclist's bicycle is damaged and needs repair, the cyclist might claim damages for loss of use. This could include the cost of renting a comparable bicycle or other transportation expenses incurred while their bicycle is unusable. 5. **Legal Fees**: If the incident results in legal action, the driver could be liable for the cyclist's legal fees, in addition to their own, depending on the outcome of the case and the laws of the jurisdiction. 6. **Increased Insurance Premiums**: While not a direct liability to the cyclist, the driver might face increased vehicle insurance premiums as a result of the accident, especially if found at fault. It’s important to note that the exact liabilities and how they are determined can vary greatly by location due to differences in traffic laws, insurance regulations, and legal systems. Both parties should exchange contact and insurance information at the scene, and it’s often advisable for both the driver and the cyclist to report the incident to their respective insurance companies, even if there appears to be no injury or significant damage. This ensures that there is a record of the incident, which can be important if any claims are made at a later date."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

At this school the girls all play rugby regularly instead of more traditional girls’ sports. The girls love playing such a rough sport and particularly enjoy the fact it gives them the opportunity to get really really muddy. For the younger girls in particular, a huge part of the appeal of rugby is getting muddy. They love not just being allowed but expected to fall, dive, slide and generally roll around in the mud and get absolutely covered in it. The older girls appreciate the skill and teamwork aspects of the sport more, but they still enjoy the mud. The girls at the school are split into three houses, each named after a flower. Please write a chapter about a muddy rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. It hasn't rained that much lately, but the pitch is a delightful mix of slimy mud and grass. Include some descriptions of several dramatic parts of the match - significant tackles, rucks, conversion kicks, scrums, whatever will add to the story. Keep the action exciting but realistic and remember the level of skill is not going to be incredibly high as these are still young players. Include some chat before the house match. Some of the girls from Rose House are excitedly inspecting the pitch and discussing the match and, in particular, how muddy it is going to be. Of course, they regularly get to train and play practice matches in the mud in their daily games lessons.","completion":"Chapter Seven: The Muddiest Match On a brisk Saturday morning, with tufts of grey clouds scampering across a pale sky, the grounds of Jasmine Towers were alive with an unusual energy. It wasn't just any weekend; it was the weekend of the much-anticipated rugby match between the junior teams of Rose House and Daisy House. The air buzzed with excitement, particularly among the younger girls, who were looking forward even more to the muddiness of the match than to the game itself. \\"Oh, look at the state of that pitch!\\" exclaimed Molly, a sprightly and enthusiastic girl from Rose House, as she and her teammates, Emma, Lucy, and Sophie, made their way towards the field for a pre-match inspection. \\"It's a proper mud bath!\\" \\"You're right, Molly,\\" Sophie remarked, her eyes gleaming. \\"I heard it rained a tiny bit overnight. Just enough to turn the pitch into a perfect slippery mess, but not too much to cancel the game.\\" \\"I bet we'll all end up more mud than girl by the end of the match,\\" Lucy chimed in with a laugh. \\"I've been looking forward to this!\\" As they neared the pitch, the unique combination of slimy mud and patches of resilient grass came into view. It looked like the ultimate playground for a raucous game of rugby, and the girls of Rose House could hardly contain their glee. Once both teams had assembled, the whistle blew, and the match kicked off amid cheers and shouts of encouragement from classmates and teachers alike. The ball, already speckled with mud, was tossed into the air, and the game began in earnest. The first dramatic moment came not five minutes into the game. Alice, a quick and agile player from Rose House, dodged two opponents from Daisy House and made a break for it, her boots squelching in the mud with every step. But just as she was about to clear the last defender, a swift tackle from Daisy's most formidable player, Sarah, sent both girls sliding through the mud, giggling despite the intense competition. As the match progressed, neither team had a clear advantage, the ball changing hands (and getting muddier) with each play. Scrums were particularly chaotic, with both sides pushing, shoving, and slipping, trying to gain possession of the elusive mud-covered ball. Inches from Daisy House's try line, a determined scrum formed. Rosie, the scrum-half for Rose House, managed to hook the ball with her foot, sending it out to Emily, who was waiting breathlessly. With an adrenaline-fueled sprint, Emily evaded a tackle and dove across the try line, sliding several feet in the mud before coming to a stop. Cheers erupted from the Rose House supporters, but the game was far from over. With minutes left on the clock, Daisy House rallied, their determination unshaken. In a fantastic display of teamwork and skill, they worked the ball down the pitch, finally scoring a try of their own. The subsequent conversion kick was a tense moment, with the kicker adjusting her stance several times in the slippery mud. With a smooth run-up and a well-timed kick, the ball sailed between the posts, drawing appreciative applause from the spectators. As the final whistle blew, signaling the end of the match, the score was tied, but no one seemed to mind. The girls from both teams were exhilarated, exhausted, and completely covered in mud from head to toe. \\"That was the best match ever!\\" Sophie declared, as the girls from Rose House huddled together, shivering and laughing. \\"I've never been this muddy in my life,\\" Emma added, trying unsuccessfully to wipe some of the mud from her face. As they made their way back to the changing rooms, the camaraderie between the teams was palpable. Today, rugby had not just been about scoring tries or winning; it had been about the sheer joy of playing in the mud, about teamwork and resilience, and most of all, about making memories that would last a lifetime at Jasmine Towers. In the days to come, the muddy match between Rose House and Daisy House would be talked about with a mixture of reverence and laughter. For many of the girls, it had been more than a game—it had been a highlight of their time at Jasmine Towers, a muddy adventure that epitomized the spirit of their school."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter. Rachel writes a letter home to her parents. A well-meaning parent who came to watch the house match suggested before kick off that perhaps it was too muddy for girls to play, and that the match should be postponed until the weather was better. Rachel exhibits a mixture of indignation and amusement at this. Why would anyone think they'd mind the mud? Everyone knows girls love getting muddy!","completion":"Chapter Eight: Mud, Glory, and a Letter Home The afternoon sun filtered through the window of Rachel's room at Jasmine Towers, casting warm patches of light on the wooden floor and the bed where Rachel was propped up with pillows, pen in hand and sheets of writing paper on her lap. On the desk nearby lay a still-damp rugby jersey, a testament to the morning's muddy exuberance. Rachel was writing a letter home to her parents, a fond smile playing on her lips as she recounted the day's events. The match had been an unforgettable display of enthusiasm, skill, and, perhaps most memorable of all, a vast amount of mud. But there was one detail that Rachel found too amusing and telling to leave out. \\"Dearest Mum and Dad,\\" she began, her pen skating across the paper with ease. \\"I hope this letter finds you both well and enjoying the comforts of home. Here at Jasmine Towers, life is as adventurous and spirited as ever. You'll never believe the fun we had today, or perhaps, given your knowledge of my love for rugby, you will! Today was the grand match between Rose House and Daisy House, eagerly anticipated by us all. But before I dive into the glorious details of muddy tackles and triumphant tries, I must share an amusing incident that occurred right before the game. A well-meaning parent, here to watch her daughter play, expressed quite vocally her concern over the state of the pitch. It was, in her eyes, far too muddy for a rugby match, especially for girls. She suggested, quite earnestly, that we postpone the game until the weather improved. You should have seen the looks on our faces! Indignation, amusement, and disbelief all mingled together. The very idea that we might mind the mud was completely foreign to us. Everyone knows that girls love getting muddy, especially here at Jasmine Towers. In fact, the mud is half the fun! It's a badge of honor, a sign of a game well played and enjoyed to the fullest. It's slipping, sliding, and laughing in the face of falls, only to pick ourselves up and dive back into the game with even more enthusiasm. The notion of postponing a match for something as trivial as mud seemed utterly ludicrous to us all. We treasure these moments of joyful abandon, where the mud is not an obstacle but a delightful addition to our adventure. Needless to say, we played on, much to the bewilderment and eventual amusement of the concerned parent. The match was a spectacular display of mud-soaked jerseys, grinning faces, and the indomitable spirit of Jasmine Towers girls. By the end, distinguishing between the teams was less about the colors of our jerseys and more about the sheer amount of mud each of us had managed to collect! As I write to you now, still finding traces of mud in the most unexpected places, I can't help but feel a deep sense of pride and camaraderie. Today wasn't just about rugby; it was a testament to our determination, our joy in the face of mess and mud, and our unwavering spirit. I can't wait to share more stories when I'm home for the holidays. Until then, know that I am happy, muddy, and thriving at Jasmine Towers. With all my muddy love, Rachel\\" Rachel finished the letter with a flourish, folding it carefully and sealing it in an envelope. She couldn't wait for her parents to read her account, to share in the laughter and pride that filled her heart. For Rachel, and for all the girls at Jasmine Towers, mud wasn't just mud—it was a symbol of their adventurous spirit, a testament to their joyful embrace of life in all its messy glory."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter. Matron observes a group of first-year girls coming off the pitch after a muddy games lesson where they have been learning how to fall safely and started to practice tackling with some tackle bags. Most of them are varying degrees of filthy, but Matron can't help noticing that Sally is noticeably cleaner than all the others. Who is the dirtiest, how and why? Of the girls other than Sally, who is the cleanest, how and why?","completion":"Chapter Nine: Muddy Lessons and Matron's Observations Matron stood beside the changing rooms, her experienced eyes carefully observing the flock of first-year girls as they trudged off the rugby pitch after their games lesson. The afternoon had been dedicated to learning the basics of rugby, focusing particularly on how to fall safely and practice tackling with bags—a necessary skill, albeit one that guaranteed an unparalleled level of mess by the session's end. Most of the girls were, as expected, varying degrees of filthy. Mud splattered their faces, jerseys, and shorts, marking an afternoon of enthusiastic, albeit novice, engagement with the sport. Matron, clucking her tongue in amusement, couldn't help but be drawn to the vast spectrum of muddiness before her. Lucy, without question, bore the title of the dirtiest of the lot. Every inch of her sports kit was caked in mud, giving her an almost comical appearance. She had thrown herself into the practice session with such gusto that she'd missed the tackle bags more often than not, instead landing squarely in the largest and wettest mud patches available. Her zeal, combined with a rather impressive talent for slipping even on the firmest parts of the pitch, had ensured that she was more mud than girl by the lesson's end. Amid the muddy chaos, however, Matron noted with a mixture of surprise and curiosity that Sally was noticeably cleaner than all her peers. While still bearing the telltale signs of the muddy pitch—splatters on her legs and a few streaks across her jersey—she was remarkably less bedragged than her compatriots. Observing keenly, Matron realized Sally's cautious approach during the tackling exercises had spared her from the worst of the mud. Sally had carefully chosen her moments to engage, demonstrating a precision that, while limiting her exposure to the thickest mud, had perhaps also curtailed the fullness of her practice experience. Among the others, who also strode off the field with varying badges of mud, Emma stood out as the cleanest, aside from Sally. Emma's cleanliness was not the result of caution or precision but rather a twist of fate. Early on, she had twisted her ankle slightly—not seriously, but enough to warrant sitting out for a good portion of the session. As she sat on the sidelines, watching her peers dive and slide, she remained relatively untouched by the mud that now adorned her friends. It was an undesired clean state, as evident by the longing look in her eyes; she wished to be as involved and as gloriously muddy as Lucy. As the girls approached, Matron's expression softened from one of observation to warmth. \\"Well, I see some of you have really embraced the mud,\\" she commented with a gentle chuckle, her gaze flitting from Lucy's mud-encased form to Sally's relatively pristine appearance. \\"We sure did, Matron!\\" Lucy exclaimed, her voice vibrant with the thrill of the lesson, despite her muddied state. \\"It was brilliant!\\" Sally, on the other hand, offered a slightly sheepish smile. \\"I guess I was a bit more careful,\\" she admitted. \\"And there's nothing wrong with that, dear,\\" Matron reassured her, her tone kind. \\"We all have our own pace. Next time, you might find yourself diving in just as much.\\" Turning towards Emma, Matron's smile turned sympathetic. \\"And, my dear, let's get that ankle seen to. Next time, you’ll be right in the thick of it, I'm sure.\\" As the girls continued towards the changing rooms, animatedly discussing their muddy adventures and mishaps, Matron watched them go fondly. She knew that each girl would find her own way in the game, her own pace, and her own level of muddiness. It was all part of learning, of growing, and of becoming part of the community at Jasmine Towers. Matron couldn't help but look forward to watching their progress, muddy or not, in the many games lessons to come."},{"prompt":"Please write another chapter.

It's heaven! She remembers getting told off for having dirty knees once, but she gets far muddier playing rugby and it's no big deal. She even jokes how she is *expected* to get muddy, and tells how one of the prissier new girls tried to stay clean and the games mistress had to gently but firmly sort her out.","completion":"Chapter Ten: A Letter Home, Full of Mud and Glee Dearest Mummy and Daddy, I hope this letter finds you both well and enjoying a peaceful and clean house—something I can't quite say for myself these days, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way! You won't believe how absolutely fantastic school has been, especially since we've started playing rugby. It's like nothing I've ever experienced before, and I must tell you all about it. Do you remember that one time when I came home with dirty knees after playing in the park, and I got a stern talking-to about keeping clean and presentable? Well, imagine this—now, getting covered from head to toe in mud is part of my school day, and far from being scolded, I'm actually praised for it! It's heaven! Rugby has quickly become my favorite part of the day. I love everything about it—the running, the teamwork, the strategy, and more than anything, the mud. Yes, you read that right! I get absolutely filthy every time we play, and it's not just allowed; it's expected! Can you believe that? The muddier, the better, it seems. I'm learning to tackle, to fall safely (which results in spectacular amounts of mud on my uniform), and to really throw myself into the game, both figuratively and literally. There's a real sense of camaraderie among us, especially when we're all covered in mud. We cheer each other on, not just for scoring tries but for every dive and slide into the mud, celebrating our willingness to get stuck in. It's such a joyous, freeing feeling, something I didn't quite understand before but now can't get enough of. Oh, and there's a funny story I must share with you! One of the new girls, Eliza, is what you might call a bit prissy. She's lovely, of course, but she started out trying her hardest to stay clean during games, tiptoeing around the edges of the mud and dodging the ball if it meant she'd have to dive for it. Well, our games mistress noticed this right away and took matters into her own hands. She had a gentle but firm chat with Eliza, explaining that rugby is a game of heart, soul, and mud. Lots of mud. The very next practice, with a bit of encouragement (and a gentle nudge into a particularly large mud puddle), Eliza was covered in mud like the rest of us, laughing and having the time of her life. It was a sight to see, and it perfectly captured the spirit of our team and this game we've all come to love. I never thought I'd say this, but I'm grateful for every speck of dirt and every bit of mud that comes my way these days. It makes me feel alive, part of a team, and incredibly happy. Being praised for getting dirty is a strange but wonderful thing, and it's one of the many reasons I've fallen in love with rugby. I promise I'll try to keep my school uniform a bit cleaner, but when it comes to rugby, all bets are off. I can't wait for you to come see a match; I think you'll be amazed at just how muddy your daughter can get, and how much she loves it.

The girls therefore don't get immediately filthy, but by the end of the match they are extremely dirty from the gradual accumulation of muck. Sophie is playing for Rose House and her parents have come to watch the match.","completion":"Chapter Eleven: The Gradual Muddening The chilly breeze of an early Saturday morning greeted the eager participants and spectators of the much-anticipated inter-house rugby match at Jasmine Towers. This time, Rose House faced off against Pansy House on a pitch that, while not as uniformly muddy as in previous encounters, presented a different challenge with its large patches of bare, clayey ground. The scene was set not just for a game of rugby but for a gradual immersion into the earthy embrace of the playing field. Sophie, proudly wearing her Rose House colors, felt a flutter of excitement in her stomach as she caught sight of her parents among the crowd. They had come to watch her play, and she was determined to make them proud. As she warmed up with her teammates, she couldn’t help but glance over at the uneven terrain, a silent promise of the mess to come. The patches of clayey mud seemed to wait with bated breath for the game to commence, ready to mark each player as she dove and tackled her way through the match. As the whistle blew, signaling the start of the game, the immediate rush of activity sent hearts racing and adrenaline pumping. The ball, clean and bright against the patchwork of green and brown, soared into the air and was met by a flurry of determined players from both teams. The first few minutes of the game played out with relatively clean uniforms, a stark contrast to the usual immediate muddiness of such matches. However, every fall, every tackle, and every ruck on the bare patches, left a thin, almost imperceptible layer of damp mud on skin and clothes. It was a gradual muddening, one that crept up on the players almost without notice. Sophie, in her zeal and determination, found herself more often than not in the thick of the action. Her parents watched with a mix of pride and slight trepidation as she confidently engaged in tackle after tackle, her face and arms slowly acquiring a sheen of mud, her jersey a canvas of clayey streaks. As the game wore on, the gradual accumulation of muck became increasingly evident. What started as mere smudges grew into full-blown coatings of mud, transforming each player into an earthy warrior, engaged in a battle not just for points but for every inch of ground gained or defended. Sophie, ever the spirited player, couldn’t resist a daring dash toward the try line, the ball tucked securely under her arm. Dodging a tackle, she slipped, her feet losing their grip on a particularly slick patch of clay. The fall sent a spray of mud up her side, but undeterred, she quickly regained her footing and crossed the try line, scoring for Rose House amidst cheers from her team and the watching crowd—most of all, from her beaming parents. By the end of the match, which saw Rose House securing a narrow victory, Sophie and her teammates were utterly transformed. Their uniforms bore little resemblance to their original colors, now adorned with the earthy signs of their hard-fought battle. Faces flushed with exertion and victory smiles, they gathered for a team cheer, their unity and sportsmanship shining through the layers of mud. Sophie’s parents made their way to her, their expressions a mix of amusement and admiration. “You were fantastic out there!” her mother exclaimed, gingerly offering a hug while trying to minimize contact with the mud. Her father chuckled, less concerned about the muck, wrapping Sophie in a proud embrace. “Looks like you’re wearing the pitch home with you,” he joked, eliciting a laugh from Sophie. As they walked back together, Sophie couldn’t help but feel a surge of happiness. The day had promised a rugby match, and it delivered so much more—a test of skill, a display of teamwork, and a memorable, mud-splattered experience shared with her teammates and her family. The gradual muddening, rather than a nuisance, had become a badge of honor, a tangible sign of the dedication and passion that defined the spirited players of Jasmine Towers."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter where the English teacher asks the junior girls to write a lighthearted essay about \\"Why rugby is the best sport, because you get muddy\\".

I firmly believe that rugby was ingeniously designed to allow girls every possible opportunity to get gloriously, joyously muddy. Allow me to explain why. Firstly, there’s the art of tackling. Not only does it require skill and courage, but it also invites us to embrace the earth in the most literal sense. When you tackle or are tackled, there's a high chance of both players ending up on the ground, which, more often than not, means ending up in the mud. It’s like receiving a muddy hug from Mother Earth herself, and it's utterly exhilarating. Then there's the diving for the try. Picture this: the try line is just a few feet away, the ball is in your arms, and you launch yourself forward. It’s not just about scoring; it’s about how you land in a splendid splash of mud, marking your achievement not just on the scoreboard but on your uniform, your face, and anywhere in between. Don't get me started on rucks and mauls. These are where the muddy magic really happens. A ruck forms, and it’s a tangle of players, all vying for the ball. You push, you shove, and invariably, you slip and slide in the mud, turning the struggle for possession into a dance with the earth beneath you. Scrumming is another muddy marvel. It’s a test of strength, of will, and of the ability to keep your footing on the slippery, muddy ground. And when the scrum collapses (as it sometimes does in the most dramatic fashion), it’s an invitation to get even muddier, a challenge we accept with glee. Lastly, there’s the simple joy of the game’s aftermath. Walking off the pitch, caked in mud from head to toe, there’s a sense of camaraderie and accomplishment that’s hard to describe. We look at each other and see warriors of the game, our mud-soaked uniforms a badge of honor, telling tales of tackles, tries, and triumphant tumbles. In conclusion, rugby must have been designed with us in mind, a gift to those of us who have longed to dive, fall, slide, and roll around in mud without a care in the world. It’s a sport that celebrates not just strength, skill, and strategy, but the sheer joy of getting dirty. This is why rugby is the best sport: because you don’t just play with a ball—you play with the earth, becoming one with the mud, and that’s a feeling like no other. --- Miss Hawthorne couldn't help but smile as she read Lucy's essay, her heart warmed by the unbridled joy and love for the sport—and for the mud—that radiated from every line. It was clear that rugby and the opportunity it provided these girls to embrace the earthy messiness of life was something truly special, a unique and cherished aspect of their time at Jasmine Towers."},{"prompt":"Please write a chapter where the English teacher asks the junior girls to write a lighthearted essay about \\"Why my rugby kit is perfect for playing in the mud\\".

The junior girls, already used to their teacher’s creative prompts, eagerly awaited the challenge. With a knowing smile, Miss Hawthorne announced, \\"Today, I'd like you to write a lighthearted essay on ‘Why my rugby kit is perfect for playing in the mud’. Remember, focus solely on the theme, leaving aside the other delightful aspects of rugby.\\" Among the flurry of pens and pensive faces, Emma set to work, her thoughts swirling with enthusiasm for the topic. Here is her essay: --- **Why My Rugby Kit is Perfect for Playing in the Mud** by Emma If ever there was a wardrobe that celebrated mud, it would undoubtedly be my rugby kit. A stark contrast to the pristine whites and light blues of my old netball attire, my rugby kit seems to have been designed with one noble purpose in mind: to get gloriously muddy alongside me. Allow me to explain why it is the perfect companion for my mud-filled rugby adventures at Jasmine Towers. Firstly, the color scheme of my rugby kit is a masterstroke of practicality. Gone are the white socks that showed every grass stain and speck of dirt, replaced by a dark palette that seems to wink at the prospect of becoming mud-splattered. The jersey and shorts, in hues of deep green and navy, serve not only as my team's colors but also as a canvas for the mud to express itself. Far from trying to protect me from the muddiness of the game, my kit embraces it, enhancing the sense of freedom and abandon with which I play. Moreover, the fabric of my rugby kit is nothing short of remarkable. It's sturdy, yet breathable—equipped to handle the rough-and-tumble of tackles and dives, all the while allowing me to roll around in the mud without feeling encased in a layer of discomfort. Where my netball kit would cling uncomfortably after a slight drizzle, my rugby gear wears its mud stains like badges of honor, drying out without losing its spirit. Most importantly, unlike the restrictive netball dress which seemed to say, \\"Stay clean,\\" my rugby kit whispers, \\"Dive in, get muddy, and have the time of your life.\\" It doesn't just tolerate the mud; it encourages it. There’s something liberating about sprinting down the field, making that crucial tackle, and sliding into victory with mud adorning my hair, face, arms, and legs. It's as if the kit and I become one with the earth itself, a testament to the joy of the game. This transformative attire doesn't seek to shield me from the mess—that glorious, wonderful mess—but rather, accompanies me into it. It doesn’t set boundaries on how covered in mud I can get; instead, it challenges me to see just how adventurous I can be. In every thread, it supports my love for getting muddy, proving itself as the perfect partner in every mucky, joyful rugby escapade. In essence, my rugby kit understands me. It knows that I don’t need protection from the mud—I crave it. Each practice, each game is an opportunity to celebrate the earthiness, the toughness, and the sheer fun of rugby. And my kit? It’s my mud-loving ally, designed not to keep me clean, but to revel with me in every muddy moment. --- As Emma concluded her essay, she couldn’t help but feel a burst of gratitude for her rugby kit, an unsung hero in her rugby journey. It wasn’t just attire; it was a symbol of the joy, the freedom, and the muddy adventures that defined her beloved sport. Miss Hawthorne, reading over Emma’s shoulder, nodded in approval and satisfaction, delighted by the passion and the muddy love stories unfolding in her classroom."},{"prompt":"Please give one of the girls' essays in full. She imagines playing rugby wearing netball kit and what a comic disaster it would be.","completion":"Chapter Fourteen: A Netball Kit's Rugby Misadventure The assignment from Miss Hawthorne had created an air of spirited focus in the English classroom at Jasmine Towers. The junior girls were tasked with writing on the theme of “Why my rugby kit is perfect for playing in the mud,” focusing on their personal experiences and imaginative comparisons. Among the eager students, Sophie took on a creative twist. Here is her essay: --- **A Netball Kit's Rugby Misadventure** by Sophie Imagine, if you will, a sunny, albeit muddy, day on the rugby pitch at Jasmine Towers, filled with anticipation and the promise of yet another gloriously messy game. Now, picture me, not in the sensible and rugged attire of my trusted rugby kit, but rather, awkwardly outfitted in my old netball kit, setting the stage for what can only be described as a comic disaster. At first glance, the lightweight fabric and freedom of movement afforded by the netball dress might seem like a blessing. But as I find myself face to face with the first challenge of the game—a headlong dive to secure the ball—the reality of the mismatch becomes painfully, or rather, humorously clear. With the lightest brush against the mud, the pristine white and pale blue of the netball kit surrender immediately, transforming into an abstract landscape of browns and greens. The dress, designed for the clean, hard courts of netball, clings and stretches in all the wrong places, becoming a sodden, heavy mass that hampers movement rather than enhances it. The lightweight, white netball shoes, once symbols of agility and grace on the netball court, turn traitor on the muddy rugby field. Each step, instead of propelling me forward with precision, becomes a comic spectacle of slips, slides, and inevitable falls, leaving me more acquainted with the earth than I ever intended. Then comes the moment of the scrum—a vital aspect of rugby that my netball kit and I are woefully unprepared for. As I crouch, ready to engage, the dainty skirt of the netball dress offers little in the way of protection or support, rendering me not a formidable opponent but rather, a reluctant performer in a slapstick routine. The pinnacle of this misadventure arrives with an attempted tackle. Launching myself with determination, I soon find that determination alone cannot compensate for the inadequacies of my attire. The tackle, rather than being a display of skill and strength, ends in a whirl of limbs and fabric, with me, once again, intimately embracing the mud, while my netball skirt flaps comically in the breeze. In the aftermath of the game, as I stand—a muddy, disheveled figure barely recognizable beneath the layers of earth—the absurdity of playing rugby in a netball kit has never been clearer. Where my rugby kit would have supported every dive, every tackle, with rugged resilience, my netball kit has faltered, turning each endeavor into a spectacle of muddied mishaps. In reflection, this imaginative foray into the disastrous pairing of a netball kit with the rough and tumble world of rugby has only heightened my appreciation for my rugby kit. It is not merely clothing; it is my armor, designed with an understanding of the game's demands and an implicit permission to revel in the mud, which, as any Jasmine Towers girl knows, is half the fun. --- Sophie’s imaginative contrast had the classroom erupting in giggles and knowing glances as they envisioned the slapstick misadventure. Her essay served not only as a creative exploration of the unsuitability of a netball kit for rugby but also as an ode to the perfectly designed ruggedness of their beloved rugby attire. Miss Hawthorne, amused and impressed, couldn’t help but commend Sophie for her spirited and inventive narrative."},{"prompt":"javascript saving an object with svg","completion":"To save an object with SVG content in JavaScript, you can create an SVG element and set its innerHTML to the SVG content you want to save.

Вот основной принцип использования \`scp\`: # Копирование файла с сервера A на сервер B На вашем локальном компьютере или на сервере A выполните следующую команду: \`\`\`bash scp /путь/к/файлу_на_сервере_A username@serverB:/путь/где/сохранить_на_сервере_B \`\`\` - \`/путь/к/файлу_на_сервере_A\` - полный путь к файлу, который вы хотите скопировать на сервере A. - \`username\` - имя пользователя на сервере B. - \`serverB\` - адрес сервера B, может быть IP-адресом или доменным именем. - \`/путь/где/сохранить_на_сервере_B\` - путь на сервере B, куда будет скопирован файл. Пример: \`\`\`bash scp /home/user/document.txt user2@192.168.1.2:/home/user2/document_copy.txt \`\`\` Эта команда скопирует \`document.txt\` из домашней папки user на сервере A в домашнюю папку user2 на сервере B под именем \`document_copy.txt\`. # Использование ключа для аутентификации Для упрощения процесса и избежания ввода пароля при каждом использовании \`scp\`, рекомендуется настроить аутентификацию по ключу SSH между серверами. Это делается созданием пары ключей (публичного и приватного) и добавлением публичного ключа в файл \`~/.ssh/authorized_keys\` на целевом сервере. # Дополнительные опции - \`-r\` - для копирования директорий рекурсивно. - \`-P port\` - если ssh на целевом сервере слушает нестандартный порт, нужно указать его через эту опцию. Пример рекурсивного копирования директории: \`\`\`bash scp -r /home/user/directory user2@192.168.1.2:/home/user2/ \`\`\` Эта команда скопирует директорию \`directory\` целиком, с содержимым внутри, в домашнюю папку user2 на сервере B."},{"prompt":"При копировании мне написало warning: permanently added to the list of known hosts","completion":"Предупреждение \\"warning: permanently added to the list of known hosts\\" является стандартным сообщением, которое появляется, когда вы впервые подключаетесь к удаленному серверу с использованием SSH или SCP (который использует тот же протокол что и SSH). Это сообщение информирует вас о том, что ключ хоста удаленного сервера был добавлен в файл \`~/.ssh/known_hosts\` на вашем локальном компьютере или сервере, с которого вы выполняете команду. Ключ хоста используется SSH для идентификации сервера. Добавление ключа в файл \`known_hosts\` помогает предотвратить атаки типа \\"man-in-the-middle\\", потому что в последующих подключениях к этому же серверу SSH будет проверять, соответствует ли ключ сервера тому, что сохранен в \`~/.ssh/known_hosts\`. Если ключи не совпадут (например, из-за попытки перехвата соединения), SSH предупредит вас об этом. Это сообщение не означает ошибку и не требует дополнительных действий, если вы действительно ожидали подключение к новому серверу. Если это ваше первое подключение к этому серверу или вы недавно переустановили систему на удаленном сервере (что могло привести к изменению его ключа), то такое сообщение является абсолютно нормальным. Однако если это предупреждение появляется при подключении к уже известному вам серверу, стоит проявить осторожность и проверить, не был ли сервер скомпрометирован или не стали ли вы жертвой атаки \\"man-in-the-middle\\". В таком случае рекомендуется связаться с администратором удаленного сервера для разрешения ситуации."},{"prompt":"Опиши личность следующих персонажей: 1. Воин-человек Андриан, ENTJ, очень храбрый и чрезмерно похотливый. 2. Волшебница-эльфийка Лилиана, INFP, очень усердная и чрезмерно жадная. 3. Плут-тифлинг Константин, ENFP, очень честный и чрезмерно самодурный. 4. Жрица-полурослик Ива, ENFJ, очень доверчивая и чрезмерно садиская.","completion":"1. **Воин-человек Андриан, ENTJ**: Андриан обладает лидерскими качествами и естественной уверенностью, которая влечёт за собой других. Как ENTJ, он стратегически подходит к решению проблем, не боится брать на себя ответственность и принимать трудные решения. Его храбрость на поле боя безупречна, он готов бросить вызов любым препятствиям в интересах своей команды или миссии. Однако его чрезмерная похотливость может сбивать его с пути, создавая сложности в межличностных отношениях и ослабляя его лидерские позиции среди товарищей, которые могут воспринимать его как кого-то, кто действует без должного уважения к другим. 2. **Волшебница-эльфийка Лилиана, INFP**: Лилиана – трудолюбивая мечтательница, следующая за голосом своего сердца и стремящаяся к идеалам. Соответственно INFP, она ценит гармонию и имеет глубокое внутреннее чувство морали, которое направляет её волшебные изыскания. Она может проводить часы, исследуя древние заклинания и поглощаться своей работой до такой степени, что забывает об окружающем мире. Неожиданно для многих, её чрезмерная жадность к власти или знаниям иногда приводит к конфликтам с другими, когда Лилиана становится слишком защитнической или эксплуатационной в отношении своих ресурсов или находок. 3. **Плут-тифлинг Константин, ENFP**: Константин – образец честности и оптимизма, что делает его необычным, но очаровательным среди плутов. С его душевной открытостью и энтузиазмом, он легко завоевывает доверие и дружбу, постоянно ищет приключения, полные эмоциональных и динамичных взаимодействий. Однако его склонность к самодурству, вероятно, вызванная уверенностью в собственной непогрешимости и безграничной свободой, может привести к недоразумениям с теми, кто считает его слишком самоуверенным или рискованным. 4. **Жрица-полурослик Ива, ENFJ**: Ива пронизана глубокой эмпатией и желанием заботиться о других, что делает её вдохновляющей лидеркой в своей общине. Её доверчивый подход укрепляет связи между людьми, а её способность видеть лучшее в каждом помогает облегчить даже самые напряжённые ситуации. Тем не менее, её садистские наклонности ставят её в уникальное положение среди жрецов; она может использовать свои знания и мощь для воздаяния или наказания, что позволяет ей действовать с жестокостью под маской доброты и заботы. Это создаёт сложный внутренний конфликт между её общественной ролью и личными желаниями."},{"prompt":"Напиши диалог с указанием действий. Тема: первое знакомство и объединение в команду.

Please note that executive positions can change, so it's best to check the companies' official websites or current business news sources for the most up-to-date information. 1. **Telstra** - CEO: *Vicki Brady* (took over from Andy Penn in 2022) 2. **Optus** - CEO: *Kelly Bayer Rosmarin* (appointed in April 2020) 3. **Vodafone Australia** (now part of TPG Telecom) - CEO of TPG Telecom Limited: *Iñaki Berroeta* (following the merger of TPG and Vodafone Australia in 2020, he became the CEO of the merged entity) 4. **TPG Telecom** - CEO: *Iñaki Berroeta* (initially the CEO of Vodafone Hutchinson Australia, he became the CEO of the merged entity) 5. **iiNet** (a subsidiary of TPG Telecom) - As iiNet is a subsidiary of TPG Telecom, it doesn't have a separate CEO.
