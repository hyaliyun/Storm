So, the relative speed is: Relative speed = Speed of Train 1 + Speed of Train 2 Relative speed = 110 km/hr + 90 km/hr Relative speed = 200 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the lengths of the trains, which are given in kilometers.

What is the probability that all three balls have even numbers and are multiples of 5?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of even numbers that are multiples of 5 between 1 and 50. An even number that is a multiple of 5 will end in 0 or 5, but since we are looking for even numbers, we only consider those ending in 0. The even multiples of 5 between 1 and 50 are: 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. So, there are 5 such numbers. Now, we need to calculate the probability of drawing 3 balls that are all even multiples of 5. Since the balls are drawn without replacement, the number of possible outcomes changes with each draw. The probability of drawing the first ball that is an even multiple of 5 is 5/50, because there are 5 favorable outcomes out of 50 possible outcomes. After drawing the first ball, there are now 4 even multiples of 5 left and 49 balls in total. So, the probability of drawing a second ball that is an even multiple of 5 is 4/49. After drawing the second ball, there are now 3 even multiples of 5 left and 48 balls in total. So, the probability of drawing a third ball that is an even multiple of 5 is 3/48. To find the overall probability of all three events occurring, we multiply the probabilities of each individual event: P(all three balls are even multiples of 5) = P(first ball is even multiple of 5) * P(second ball is even multiple of 5) * P(third ball is even multiple of 5) P(all three balls are even multiples of 5) = (5/50) * (4/49) * (3/48) Now, let's calculate this: P(all three balls are even multiples of 5) = (1/10) * (4/49) * (1/16) P(all three balls are even multiples of 5) = (1/10) * (1/49) * (1/4) P(all three balls are even multiples of 5) = 1/1960 So, the probability that all three balls drawn without replacement have even numbers and are multiples of 5 is boxed{1/1960} ."},{"prompt":"Johnson owns a hectare cornfield that can yield some corn every two months, while his neighbor owns a twohectare cornfield and each hectare can yield twice the amount as Johnson.

Johnson's neighbor has a two-hectare cornfield, and each hectare yields twice the amount of Johnson's. Therefore, each hectare of the neighbor's field yields ( 2J ) corns every two months, and since there are two hectares, the total yield for the neighbor every two months is ( 2 times 2J = 4J ) corns. Over six months, there are three two-month periods. So, Johnson will harvest ( 3J ) corns in six months, and his neighbor will harvest ( 3 times 4J = 12J ) corns in the same period. Together, they harvest 1200 corns in six months. So, we can write the equation: [ 3J + 12J = 1200 ] Combining like terms, we get: [ 15J = 1200 ] Now, we solve for ( J ): [ J = frac{1200}{15} ] [ J = 80 ] Therefore, Johnson's hectare can yield boxed{80} corns every two months."},{"prompt":"Restore the isosceles triangle ABC ( AB = AC ) if the common points I, M, H of bisectors, medians and altitudes respectively are given.","completion":"1. **Identify the given points and their properties:** - ( I ) is the incenter of the triangle ( triangle ABC ). - ( M ) is the centroid of the triangle ( triangle ABC ). - ( H ) is the orthocenter of the triangle ( triangle ABC ). 2. **Use Euler's theorem:** Euler's theorem states that in any triangle, the orthocenter ( H ), the centroid ( M ), and the circumcenter ( O ) are collinear, and the distance between the centroid and the orthocenter is twice the distance between the centroid and the circumcenter: [ OH = 3OM ] Given ( H ) and ( M ), we can find ( O ) using the relation: [ O = M + frac{1}{3}(H - M) ] 3. **Find the excenter ( I_A ):** The excenter ( I_A ) opposite to vertex ( A ) can be found using the properties of the triangle.

When n=2, we have frac{a_2+2}{2} = 2sqrt{S_2}, S_2 = a_1 + a_2, substituting a_1 = 2 into it, we get (a_2 - 2)^2 = 16, since a_2 > 0, solving this gives a_2 = 6.

So, if the marked point is at ((i, frac{1}{i})), then the other vertices lie at ((i, 0)) and ((0, frac{1}{i})). 3. **Height and Width of Rectangles:** Let's consider the rectangle formed when Misha marks the point ((i+1)): - The width of each rectangle is the difference between consecutive x-coordinates, which is (1), because each step in x is of width 1 unit between (i) and (i+1). - The height for each rectangle (h_i) can be represented as the difference between the inverse function values at consecutive integers.

Hence, (tan a = 0) is indeed a solution as it keeps both (tan a) and (tan 3a) as integers. 2. **Using the triple angle formula for tangent:** We know the formula for the tangent of a triple angle: [ tan 3a = frac{3 tan a - tan^3 a}{1 - 3 tan^2 a} ] 3. **Considering (tan a neq 0):** Let's assume (tan a neq 0).

Therefore, we calculate the probability for the range 950 leq X leq 1100 as follows: [P(950 leq X leq 1100) = P(950 leq X leq 1050) + frac{1}{2}[P(900 leq X leq 1100) - P(950 leq X leq 1050)]] [= 0.6827 + frac{1}{2}(0.9545 - 0.6827)] [= 0.6827 + frac{1}{2}(0.2718)] [= 0.6827 + 0.1359] [= 0.8186].

Since the circle is tangent to the line (x-y+1=0), the distance, (d), from the center of the circle ((2, b)) to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle. The distance from a point ((x_0, y_0)) to a line (Ax + By + C = 0) is given by the formula d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Using this formula, we have sqrt{(2-1)^2+b^2} = frac{|2-b+1|}{sqrt{2}}. Squaring both sides of the equation, we get (2-1)^2 + b^2 = frac{(2-b+1)^2}{2}, which simplifies to 1 + b^2 = frac{(3-b)^2}{2}. Expanding the squares, we obtain 1 + b^2 = frac{9 - 6b + b^2}{2}. Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction, we get 2 + 2b^2 = 9 - 6b + b^2, which simplifies to b^2 + 6b - 7 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for (b), we get two solutions: (b = 1) or (b = -7). Since (b) must be positive (the center is in the first quadrant), we discard (b = -7) and have (b = 1). Therefore, the center of circle (C) is (C(2,1)), and the radius (r) is equal to r = sqrt{(2-1)^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{2}. The standard equation of a circle with center ((h, k)) and radius (r) is ((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2). Thus, the standard equation of circle (C) is (x - 2)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 2.

Parsley: - Started with 1 parsley plant. - Grows steadily with one new plant each week, so after six weeks, there would be 1 + 6 = 7 parsley plants. - However, in the fifth week, caterpillars devoured two of the parsley plants, so 7 - 2 = 5 parsley plants. 3.

There are 10 ways to do this. After removing the president from the pool, we have 9 people left. We then need to choose 3 members from these 9 to form a committee.

The number of ways to choose 3 members out of 9 can be calculated using the binomial coefficient, ( binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} ), where ( n ) is the total number of items to pick from, and ( k ) is the number of items to pick.

Denote by ( omega ) the circumcircle of the triangle formed by the perpendicular bisectors of segments ( AD ), ( BE ), and ( CF ). We are to show that ( omega_A ), ( omega_B ), ( omega_C ), and ( omega ) have a common point. 1. Circles ( omega_A ), ( omega_B ), and ( omega_C ) share a common point ( Q ) different from ( P ). Notice that ( m_A ) is the perpendicular bisector of ( PD ), so ( omega_A ) is symmetric with respect to ( m_A ). Since ( A ) and ( A_1 ) are also symmetric to each other in ( m_A ), the point ( A_1 ) lies on ( omega_A ). Similarly, ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) lie on ( omega_B ) and ( omega_C ), respectively. Let ( H ) be the orthocenter of ( triangle ABC ). Quadrilaterals ( ABA_1B_1 ) and ( BCB_1C_1 ) are cyclic, so ( AH cdot HA_1 = BH cdot HB_1 = CH cdot HC_1 ). This means that ( H ) lies on the pairwise radical axes of ( omega_A ), ( omega_B ), and ( omega_C ). Point ( P ) also lies on those radical axes; hence the three circles have a common radical axis ( ell - PH ). The second meeting point ( Q ) of ( ell ) with ( omega_A ) is the second common point of the three circles. Notice here that ( H ) lies inside all three circles, hence ( Q neq P ). 2. Point ( Q ) lies on ( omega ). Let ( p_A ), ( p_B ), and ( p_C ) denote the perpendicular bisectors of ( AD ), ( BE ), and ( CF ), respectively; denote by ( Delta ) the triangle formed by those perpendicular bisectors. By Simson's theorem, in order to show that ( Q ) lies on the circumcircle ( omega ) of ( Delta ), it suffices to prove that the projections of ( Q ) onto the sidelines ( p_A ), ( p_B ), and ( p_C ) are collinear. Alternatively, but equivalently, it suffices to prove that the reflections ( Q_A ), ( Q_B ), and ( Q_C ) of ( Q ) in those lines, respectively, are collinear. In fact, we will show that four points ( P ), ( Q_A ), ( Q_B ), and ( Q_C ) are collinear. Since ( p_A ) is the common perpendicular bisector of ( AD ) and ( QQ_A ), the point ( Q_A ) lies on ( omega_A ), and, moreover, ( angle(DQ_A, DA) = angle(PQ, PA) ). Therefore, [ angle(PA, PQ_A) = angle(DA, DQ_A) - angle(AQ, AD), ] where the angles are taken modulo ( 180^circ ). Similarly, we have ( angle(PB, PQ_B) = angle(PQ, CA) + 90^circ ).

Similarly, ( Q_C ) also lies on the line determined by ( P ) and ( Q_A ). 3. Additional Comments: There are several variations of Step 2. In particular, let ( O_A ), ( O_B ), and ( O_C ) denote the centers of ( omega_A ), ( omega_B ), and ( omega_C ), respectively; they lie on ( p_A ), ( p_B ), and ( p_C ), respectively. Moreover, all those centers lie on the perpendicular bisector ( p ) of ( PQ ). Now one can show that ( angle(QO_A, p_A) = angle(QO_B, p_B) = angle(QO_C, p_C) ), and then finish by applying the generalized Simson's theorem. Alternatively, but equivalently, those relations show that ( Q ) is the Miquel point of the lines ( p_A ), ( p_B ), ( p_C ), and ( p ). To establish ( angle(QO_A, p_A) = angle(QO_C, p_C) ), notice that it is equivalent to ( angle(QO_A, QO_C) = angle(p_A, p_C) ). This can be obtained as follows: [ begin{array}{l} angle(QO_A, QO_C) = angle(QO_A, p) + angle(p, QO_C) = angle(AQ, AP) + angle(CP, CQ) = angle(AQ, CQ) + angle(CP, AP) = angle(AQ, PQ) + angle(PQ, CQ) + angle(CB, AB) = angle(AD, AA_1) + angle(CC_1, CF) + angle(AA_1, CC_1) = angle(AD, CF) = angle(p_A, p_C). end{array} ] In conclusion: [ boxed{text{The circles } omega_A, omega_B, omega_C, text{ and } omega text{ have a common point.}} ]"},{"prompt":"an 8 times 5 grid of lattice points, where each point is one unit away from its nearest neighbors horizontally and vertically, consider the following points: A(0, 4), B(7, 0), C(5, 3), and D(3, 0).

Let ( B = M_{m times n}(mathbb{Z}_N) ), the additive group of all ( m times n ) matrices with coefficients in (mathbb{Z}_N), which we identify with (mathbb{Z}_N^{mn}). For any ( 1 leq i leq m ) and ( 1 leq j leq n ), we write ( u_{ij} ) for the matrix whose ( i )-th row and ( j )-th column are all equal to 1, and all other entries are zero.

Let ( a = (a_{ij})_{ij} ) be a matrix that is in the orthogonal complement of ( A ). This is equivalent to saying that (langle a, u_{ij} rangle = 0) for any ( i, j ). 4. **Row and Column Sums**: For any ( i, j ), we write ( r_i ) for the sum (sum_j a_{ij}) and ( c_j ) for the sum (sum_i a_{ij}). The definition of ( u_{ij} ) then gives (langle a, u_{ij} rangle = r_i + c_j - a_{ij} ). Therefore, we have ( a_{ij} = r_i + c_j ) for any ( i, j ). 5. **Summing Over Rows and Columns**: Summing up for all ( j ), we get ( r_i = sum_j (r_i + c_j) = n r_i + s ) where we write ( s = sum_i r_i = sum_j c_j = sum_{ij} a_{ij} ). This gives ((n - 1) r_i = -s). Since ( n - 1 ) is invertible in (mathbb{F}_p), we see that all ( r_i ) are equal. Similarly, summing up for all ( i ) gives us ((m - 1) c_j = -s), which implies that all ( c_j ) are equal. Consequently, all ( a_{ij} ) are equal to a constant ( x in mathbb{F}_p ). 6. **Final Step**: Thus ( r_i = n x ) and ( c_j = m x ), and the identity ( a_{ij} = r_i + c_j ) becomes ((m + n - 1) x = 0), from which we conclude ( x = 0 ) as ( m + n - 1 ) is invertible in (mathbb{F}_p). We have shown that any matrix in the orthogonal complement of ( A ) is equal to 0, thus ( A = B ).

Since Pipe B can fill the tank 3 times as fast as Pipe A, it would take Pipe B ( frac{t}{3} ) minutes to fill the tank alone. When both pipes are working together, their combined rate of filling the tank is the sum of their individual rates. The rate at which a pipe fills a tank is the reciprocal of the time it takes to fill the tank. Therefore, the combined rate of both pipes is ( frac{1}{t} + frac{3}{t} = frac{4}{t} ). We know that when both pipes are open, it takes 3 minutes to fill the tank. This means that the combined rate of both pipes is ( frac{1}{3} ) of the tank per minute.

Hence, independently of the last move, whether 15 or 15^{2} is written, the remainder when divided by 3 will not change because: [ 15 equiv 0 pmod{3} quad text{and} quad 15^2 = 225 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] 2. Let's consider the 14th move. Here, 14 is not divisible by 3. - We find: [ 14 equiv 2 pmod{3} ] - And: [ 14^2 = 196 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] 3. Since 14 is even, it is Bernaldo’s turn for this move. Bernaldo can then strategize as follows: - If the sum of the first 13 numbers gives a remainder of either 0 or 2 when divided by 3, Bernaldo should play 14. This will change the remainders as: [ 0 + 2 = 2 quad text{or} quad 2 + 2 = 4 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] - If the sum of the first 13 numbers gives a remainder of 1, Bernaldo should play 196. This will change the remainder as: [ 1 + 1 = 2 pmod{3} ] 4. Thus, Bernaldo can always manipulate the sum so it is not divisible by 3 after the 14th move, ensuring Arnaldo cannot win. **Conclusion:** Bernaldo can guarantee his victory. [ blacksquare ] **(b) Suppose the game ends on the 7th move. Which player can always guarantee victory regardless of how the opponent plays, and how should they play to win?** 1. Notice that both 7 and 7^2 = 49 give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3: [ 7 equiv 1 pmod{3} quad text{and} quad 49 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] Hence, the 7th move adds 1 to the sum modulo 3, independent of choice. 3. Extending this reasoning to other numbers: - Numbers like 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7, as well as their squares, have the same remainders modulo 3: [ 1 equiv 1 pmod{3}, quad 1^2 = 1 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] [ 3 equiv 0 pmod{3}, quad 3^2 = 9 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] [ 4 equiv 1 pmod{3}, quad 4^2 = 16 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] [ 6 equiv 0 pmod{3}, quad 6^2 = 36 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] [ 7 equiv 1 pmod{3}, quad 7^2 = 49 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] Therefore, these numbers would contribute remainders: [ 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] 4. The relevant moves are thus the 2nd move (Bernaldo’s turn) and the 5th move (Arnaldo’s turn). Arnaldo can guarantee victory by controlling his 5th move: - If Bernaldo plays 2, then Arnaldo should play 25 (5^2) to achieve: [ 2 + 25 = 27 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] - If Bernaldo plays 4, then Arnaldo should play 5 to achieve: [ 4 + 5 = 9 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] **Conclusion:** Arnaldo can always guarantee victory by choosing properly in the 5th move.

The area of the triangle can be expressed in two different ways: [ frac{ab}{2} = frac{cm}{2} ] From the above equation, we get: [ ab = cm ] 3. Squaring both sides, we have: [ (ab)^2 = (cm)^2 ] Therefore, [ a^2 b^2 = c^2 m^2 ] 4. Knowing that in a right triangle with legs a and b and hypotenuse c, Pythagoras' theorem gives us: [ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ] So substituting this, we get: [ m^2 = frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2 + b^2} ] 5. According to the problem, the triangle formed by the altitudes of the original right triangle is also a right triangle. Therefore, applying the Pythagorean theorem to these altitudes, [ a^2 + m^2 = b^2 ] 6. Substitute the expression for m^2: [ a^2 + frac{a^2 b^2}{a^2 + b^2} = b^2 ] 7.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle QTR yields: [ x^2 + h^2 = 25 ] and on triangle QTP yields: [ (12-x)^2 + h^2 = 100 ] Expanding the second equation gives: [ 144 - 24x + x^2 + h^2 = 100 ] Substituting 25 for x^2 + h^2 gives: [ 25 + 144 - 24x = 100 implies 24x = 69 implies x = frac{69}{24} = frac{23}{8} ] Then, h=sqrt{25-x^2}=sqrt{25-left(frac{23}{8}right)^2}=sqrt{frac{3601}{64}}=frac{sqrt{3601}}{8}.

The segment ( AB ) acts as the diameter of a circle passing through ( M ) and ( N ). 3. **Midpoint Calculation**: To find this circle's center ( D ), we need to calculate the midpoint of ( MN ).

Assuming all clocks (A, B, C, and D) are hung normally and facing the mirror, when you look into the mirror, the hour hand and minute hand positions will appear reversed horizontally. 4. If the original time of the clocks were as such: - Clock A: The hour and minute hands are positioned to show a certain time. - Clock B: The hour and minute hands are positioned differently. - Clock C: The hour hand is closest to 4 PM (16:00). - Clock D: The hour and minute hands are showing another time. 5.

Given problem is to use m colors to paint the 8 vertices of a cube V. Each vertex should be painted with one color, and we want to find the number of distinct ways to paint these vertices, denoted as h(m). 2. Let (D, *) denote the group of rotations of the cube V. This group, also known as the symmetries of the cube, contains 24 elements. Each element represents a different rotation of the cube. 3. Let (G, circ) be the set of distinct colorings of the vertices of the cube induced by the group (D, *). Two colorings are considered equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a rotation in D. 4. By application of Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct colorings is given by the average number of colorings fixed by each rotation. Burnside's Lemma states: [ h(m) = frac{1}{|G|} sum_{g in G} text{Fix}(g) ] where text{Fix}(g) is the number of colorings that are invariant under a rotation g. 5. We need to calculate text{Fix}(g) for each type of rotation. The rotations of a cube can be categorized as follows: - Identity rotation (1 element) - 90° and 270° rotations about the axes passing through the centers of faces (6 elements) - 180° rotations about the axes passing through the centers of faces (3 elements) - 120° and 240° rotations about axes passing through opposite vertices (8 elements) - 180° rotations about axes passing through the midpoints of opposite edges (6 elements) 6. For each rotation type: - **Identity rotation** (1 element): Leaves all 8 vertices unchanged. [ text{Fix}(text{identity}) = m^8 ] - **90° and 270° rotations about face-centered axes** (6 elements): These rotations form 2 cycles with 4 vertices each. [ text{Fix}(text{90° or 270° rotation}) = m^2 cdot m^2 = m^2 cdot m^2 = m^4 ] However, for each rotation the two distinct 4-cycles need to match, thus: [ text{Fix(total 6 elements)} = 6 cdot m^2 ] - **180° rotations about face-centered axes** (3 elements): These rotations form 4 cycles with 2 vertices each. [ text{Fix}(text{180° face-centered rotation}) = m^2 cdot m^2 cdot m^2 cdot m^2 = m^8 ] Each rotation type repeats, so total fixings: [ text{Fix(total 3 elements)} = 3 cdot m^4 ] - **120° and 240° rotations about vertex-centered axes** (8 elements): These result in 2 cycles of 3 vertices and 2 remaining fixed points. [ text{Fix}(text{120° or 240°)} = m^2 cdot m^2 cdot m^2 = m^6 ] Thus: [ text{Fix(total 8 elements)} = 8 cdot m^2 cdot m cdot m = 8m^2 ] - **180° rotations about edge-centered axes** (6 elements): These form 4 cycles of 2 vertices each, thus: [ text{Fix}(text{180° edge-centered rotation}) = m^4 ] Thus total fixed points: [ text{Fix(6 elements total)} = 6 cdot m^4 ] 7. Summing all these fixed points together: [ text{Total fixed colorings} = m^8 + 6m^2 + 3m^4 + 8(m^2 cdot m) + 6(m^2) ] 8.

We know that the merchant sells 600 kg at 18% profit and the remaining (1000 kg - 600 kg) = 400 kg at P% profit. Let's denote the cost price of 1 kg of sugar as C. Then the total cost price for 1000 kg of sugar is 1000C. The merchant gains 14% on the whole, so the total selling price for 1000 kg of sugar is 1000C + 14% of 1000C = 1000C + 0.14 * 1000C = 1000C * (1 + 0.14) = 1000C * 1.14. Now, let's calculate the selling price for the two parts of sugar: 1. For the 600 kg sold at 18% profit, the selling price is 600C + 18% of 600C = 600C + 0.18 * 600C = 600C * (1 + 0.18) = 600C * 1.18. 2. For the 400 kg sold at P% profit, the selling price is 400C + P% of 400C = 400C + 0.01P * 400C = 400C * (1 + 0.01P). The total selling price is the sum of the selling prices of the two parts: Total Selling Price = 600C * 1.18 + 400C * (1 + 0.01P). We know that the Total Selling Price is also equal to 1000C * 1.14. So we can set up the equation: 600C * 1.18 + 400C * (1 + 0.01P) = 1000C * 1.14. Now we can solve for P: 600C * 1.18 + 400C + 4C * P = 1000C * 1.14, 708C + 400C + 4C * P = 1140C, 1108C + 4C * P = 1140C, 4C * P = 1140C - 1108C, 4C * P = 32C.

Therefore, 2 S_{i} geq i a_{i+1}. 4. **Sum Manipulation**: Consider the sum: sum_{i=1}^n frac{a_{i}}{i} = sum_{i=1}^n frac{S_{i} - S_{i-1}}{i}.

Denote the total number of these dividers by N. 3. **Examining any 2 times 2 sub-square** In any 2 times 2 sub-square, there are either: - Exactly one cell of one color and three cells of another color - Two adjacent white cells and two adjacent black cells. In both cases, there are exactly two dividers within the 2 times 2 sub-square. 4. **Counting the total number of dividers** The board has 99^2 such 2 times 2 sub-squares, as there are 100 rows and columns. However, each divider is counted precisely twice (once for each 2 times 2 sub-square it belongs to): [ N = 2 cdot (99^2 text{ sub-squares}) = 2 cdot 99^2 / 2 = 99^2 ] 5. **Determining the parity (evenness) of N** Note that N must be even because: - In each row and column, the first and the last cell are always black. - Therefore, there must be an even number of color changes.

The sum of the floor functions equals 21, which means exactly 21 of these terms are equal to 1, and the rest are 0. This implies that starting from some point in the sequence, the value of [m+frac{k}{2022}] becomes 1 and remains 1 for all subsequent terms. Given 2022 terms in total and 21 of them equal to 1, it follows that the first 2022 - 21 = 2001 terms must be 0. Therefore, we can deduce that: 1.

This is because the intersection of two lines creates four distinct areas. 3. **Adding one more line:** - By adding a third line, we need to determine how many additional regions can be created. - If this new line intersects the previous two lines at different points, it would add exactly 2 more regions.

Provide an example of an arrangement of people and seats such that exactly one person is sitting in front of their own name card, and rotating the table cannot result in more than one person sitting in front of their name card.","completion":"Let's first take care of translating the given text and then solve it step by step. 1. There are 15 seats arranged evenly around a circular table with name cards placed in front of each seat. None of the guests sits in front of their own name card. Prove that by rotating the circular table, at least two guests will end up sitting in front of the correct name cards. 2. Provide an example of a seating arrangement where exactly one guest sits in front of the correct name card, and rotating the circular table does not cause more guests to sit in front of their correct name cards. Let's solve the problem step by step. Part 1: 1. For each guest, there is exactly one rotation of the table that would align their seat with their name card. 2. Given that there are 15 seats, there can be at most 14 effective rotations (excluding the identity rotation where all seats remain fixed). 3. By the pigeonhole principle, which states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item, we infer that there is at least one rotation such that at least 2 guests are sitting in front of their correct name cards. Thus, it is guaranteed that at least two guests will match their name cards with some rotation of the table. blacksquare Part 2: We are asked to provide an example where exactly one guest sits in front of the correct name card, and rotating the table doesn't increase the number of matching guests. 1. Number the positions around the table from 1 to 15 and number the guests 1 to 15. Let each guest's name card have a corresponding number. 2. Arrange the guests such that the guest in position x faces the card with number 16 - x (where 16 - x is taken modulo 15). For instance, if a guest is in position x, their name card would be in position 16 - x mod 15. 3. If we rotate the table by y positions, the guest in position x will then face the card at position (16 - x + y) mod 15. To find the conditions under which a guest x faces their name card, we solve for x: [ x equiv 16 - x + y pmod{15} ] Let us simplify this step-by-step: [ 2x equiv 16 + y pmod{15} ] Therefore, each y will provide a unique solution for x, making each y corresponding to exactly one such \\"correct\\" seating. This can be verified using modular arithmetic properties, making sure the example holds. From the arrangement described, suppose the initial alignment places guest x such that 16-x corresponds to their name card. Then, under a rotation by y that corresponds to x equiv 16 - x + y pmod{15}, all other guests do not align correctly. Therefore, this ensures that there is one correct alignment, and no further rotations increase the number of correct alignments as desired. boxed{text{Example: }} Assign guests 1 to 15 and name cards such that guest x faces card 16 - x.

For the sum of the roots: [3 - frac{4}{3} = -frac{5}{k}] Simplifying the left side gives: [3 - frac{4}{3} = frac{9}{3} - frac{4}{3} = frac{5}{3}] This equation is based on the property that the sum of the roots is equal to -frac{b}{a}, but we need to correct the equation to match the standard form, which should be: [3 + left(-frac{4}{3}right) = -frac{-5}{k}] This simplifies to: [frac{5}{3} = frac{5}{k}] 2. For the product of the roots: [3 cdot left(-frac{4}{3}right) = frac{-12}{k}] Simplifying gives: [-4 = frac{-12}{k}] From the second equation, we can solve for k directly: [-4 = frac{-12}{k}] Multiplying both sides by k and then dividing by -4 gives: [k = 3] Therefore, the value of k for which the given quadratic equation has the specified solutions is boxed{3}."},{"prompt":"a speech competition, it is necessary to arrange the order of appearance for 10 contestants based on the number of strokes in their surnames, from the fewest to the most.

When (a) is indeed zero, the quadratic equation transforms into a linear equation and has only one solution as derived above. The phrase \\"one of the roots is (infty)\\" essentially refers to the fact that if the quadratic term disappears (as (a rightarrow 0)), the second root grows without bound or becomes undefined. But mathematically, we should consider only the specific scenario where (a = 0): In such a conditional scenario: - One root becomes (x = -frac{c}{b}), as we derived. - The root that grew unboundedly in the transitional approach as (a rightarrow 0) is interpreted as a loose or informal way to say that the nature of second root is insufficiently defined in the same context, implying it tends toward infinity or does not realistically exist. 6. **General Case Verification:** To corroborate this understanding with the general quadratic roots in the context of ( a rightarrow 0 ), consider the general quadratic solution: [ x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] As (a rightarrow 0): - If we plug in (a = 0), the formula becomes undefined due to division by zero, further stressing the transformation to a linear scenario.

The smallest 8-digit number is 10,000,000 and the largest is 99,999,999. For the sum of the digits to be equal to 2, we have very limited options because all digits must be 0 except for the digits that add up to 2. There are two ways to have a sum of 2: 1. One of the digits is 2 and the rest are 0. 2. Two of the digits are 1 and the rest are 0. Let's consider each case: 1. One digit is 2: Since we cannot have the leading digit as 0 (because then it wouldn't be an 8-digit number), the digit '2' can be placed in any of the last 7 positions. This gives us 7 different numbers. 2. Two digits are 1: Similarly, we cannot have the leading digit as 0. We have to place two '1's in the last 7 positions. The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 7 is given by the combination formula (C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}), where (n) is the total number of positions and (k) is the number of positions we want to choose.

This means that the task of adding axles (let's call it Task A) and the task of adding wheels (Task W) are linked. We have 6 tasks in total: A (axles), W (wheels), I (install windshield), P (install instrument panel), S (steering wheel), and C (interior seating). Since A must come before W, we can treat them as a single combined task for the moment (let's call it Task AW). Now we have 5 \\"tasks\\" to arrange: AW, I, P, S, and C. The number of ways to arrange 5 tasks is 5! (5 factorial), which is: 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 However, within the combined task AW, there are 2 ways to arrange A and W (since A must come before W, it's either AW or WA, but WA is not allowed, so there's actually only 1 way to arrange AW). So, the total number of ways to arrange the assembly line, considering the constraint, is the same as the number of ways to arrange 5 tasks, which is 120.

Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction: -3frac{3}{8} = -frac{27}{8}. 2. Apply the negative exponent: {(-frac{27}{8})}^{-frac{2}{3}} = frac{1}{sqrt[3]{(-frac{27}{8})^{2}}}. 3. Simplify the cube root and square: sqrt[3]{(-frac{27}{8})^{2}} = (frac{3}{2})^{3 times frac{2}{3}} = frac{3}{2}. 4. The expression becomes: frac{1}{(frac{3}{2})} = frac{2}{3}. Next, we simplify the logarithmic part: 1. Recognize that log_{9}5 can be rewritten using the change of base formula: log_{9}5 = log_{3^2}5. 2. Simplify the expression inside the logarithm: {3}^{log_{3^2}5} - {(3sqrt{3})}^{frac{2}{3}} + {7}^{log_{7}3}. 3.

The expression inside the logarithm simplifies to: 3^{log_{3}{5^{frac{1}{2}}}} - 2 times 7^{frac{1}{3}} + 3. Finally, we combine the simplified expressions: 1. The entire expression simplifies to: frac{2}{3} times log_{5}{5^{frac{1}{2}}}. 2.

This is a smaller room number than the one we started with, contradicting the assumption that our room was the first on its hall. Therefore, (m) must be odd. 8. **Refining the Room Number**: - Thus, we write (m = 2j + 1) for some (j), so our room number can now be written as: [ 3 cdot 2^{2k-1}(2j+1) + 2^{2k-1} = 3 cdot 2^{2k} cdot j + 2^{2k+1}. ] 9. **Claiming (j) is Even**: - We now claim that (j) is even, completing our induction. Assume (j) is odd. - By repeating the application rule again, we find: [ left(frac{3}{2}right)^{2k}left(3 cdot 2^{2k} cdot j + 2^{2k+1}right) = 3^{2k+1} cdot j + 2 cdot 3^{2k}. ] - Since we are assuming (j) is odd, this number is odd, so it is on the same hall as room: [ frac{3^{2k+1} cdot j + 2 cdot 3^{2k} - 1}{2}. ] 10. **Repeating Process**: - This room number is 1(bmod 3), and similarly to before, we find by repeatedly applying the rule that rooms (n) and ((n-1)/3) are connected that our room is on the same hall as room: [ frac{3^{i} cdot j + 2 cdot 3^{i-1} - 1}{2} ] for each positive integer (i). 11. **Final Contradiction**: - In particular, it is on the same hall as room ((3j+1)/2), which is smaller than our starting room number, contradicting the assumption that (j) was odd. Therefore, (j) must be even. This completes our proof. # Conclusion: Thus, since no rooms other than room 1 can be the first room on its hall, all rooms must be on the same hall.

Our goal is to determine the minimum number of straight lines, not parallel to the sides of the square, required to cover all 100 points. Strategy: - We choose lines parallel to one of the diagonals of the square, which pass through multiple marked points. Step-by-Step Calculation: 1. **Analysis of Diagonal Lines Passing Through Points:** - For any diagonal line passing through a point ((i, j)) in the unit grid, it must satisfy (i + j = k) or (i - j = k) for some integer (k). 2. **Counting Lines Parallel to One Diagonal:** - Consider lines parallel to the line (i + j = k). The values of (k) range from 2 to 20 (considering both grid boundaries at (i = j = 1) and (i = j = 10)). - Similarly, for lines parallel to (i - j = k), (k) ranges from -9 to 9. 3. **Total Number of Lines Covering All Points:** - If we use all lines of the form (i + j = k), we use (19) lines. - Reducing this number by noting that diagonals through edges overlap substantially, the number is optimized. Consider using (17) lines to cover the most points without redundancy whenever possible. - Two edge points will not be covered this way (those at the borders when (k = 1) and (k = 19)). 4. **Adding the Second Diagonal:** - To cover the remaining two points, one additional line along the other diagonal is used, ensuring all remaining points are covered effectively. Proof of Minimum Number: 5. We now justify (18) lines is minimal: - Direct observation shows a line not parallel to a side of the square can at most cover 2 unique edge points (per perimeter section). - Given there are (36) such edge points: [ 36 / 2 = 18 text{ lines at a minimum to cover edge points}. ] Conclusion: 6. **Solution:** - The minimum number of lines required is indeed (18), proven both constructively and by combinatorial argument.

Substitute this into the original equation and equate it to 343: [ x^3 + y^3 + 21xy = 343 ] Cancelling out (343) from both sides gives: [ x^3 + y^3 - 343 - 21xy + 343 = 0 ] [ x^3 + y^3 - 21xy = 0 ] This simplifies to: [ x^3 + y^3 - 21xy + 343 = 343 ] 5.

For the expression (left(x+y-7right) left(x^2 + y^2 + 49 - xy + 7y + 7xright)) to equal 0, either: - (x + y - 7 = 0), which means (x + y = 7), or - (x^2 + y^2 + 49 - xy + 7y + 7x = 0), which must be further simplified to evaluate. 7. Simplify the term: [ x^2 + y^2 + 49 - xy + 7y + 7x = 0 ] Given the complexity, another possible solution is (x = y = -7) leading to: [ x + y = -14 ] 8.

Consider triangles ( triangle ACM ) and ( triangle BDM ): - We know ( angle ACM = angle BDM ) since corresponding angles in squares are all (90^circ). 2. Since the triangles share a common angle at ( M ), and they have right angles at ( C ) and ( D ), they are similar: triangle ACM sim triangle BDM 3. Given that (AN) and (BN) are diameters: - Consider the diagonal of squares. They intersect at the center, and any line containing the diagonals of two adjacent squares on the same line will lie on the line connecting their centers. - As both points (N) lie on the circle, it is evident that (angle ANM) and (angle BNM) must also both be (90^circ). 4. The crucial observation here is utilizing the properties of the circle: - Since (BN perp AC), the triangle formed, ( triangle ANB ), must be right-angled at (N). 5. Since squares (AM) and (MB) are on the same side: - (AC) and (BD) form a perpendicular bisector, and thus intersecting at ( N ) means ( N ) is equidistant from the triangle’s vertices ( A, B, M ). # Conclusion: Therefore, we conclude that: - The line (AN) indeed passes through the vertex (C) of the second square. - Triangle ( triangle ANB ) is right-angled.

Without loss of generality, assume A is a superset of B or vice versa. Then, their symmetric difference (the elements in A not in B and vice versa) is a non-empty subset of overall sum divisible by frac{n(n+1)}{2}.

Given that there are two rows, each containing 10 unique numbers, we need to determine these numbers based on the rule that if the number ( b ) is under ( a ) and ( d ) is under ( c ), then ( a + d = b + c ). 2. For simplicity, let the rows be numbered as follows: [ begin{array}{cccccccccc} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & ldots & a_{10} b_1 & b_2 & b_3 & ldots & b_{10} end{array} ] 3.

[ boxed{11} ] Part (b): Prove that at least ( m+n-1 ) numbers must remain to rebuild the missing entries in an ( m times n ) table 1. Consider an ( m times n ) table where for any rectangle formed by rows and columns, the sum of the numbers at two opposite corners equals the sum of the numbers at the other two opposite corners. 2. Assume that some numbers in this table have been erased. We need to show that if at least ( m+n-1 ) numbers remain, the entire table can be completely reconstructed uniquely. Proof by Induction: 1. Base Case: For the smallest non-trivial cases, like a ( 1 times n ) or ( m times 1 ) table, it's clear that knowing ( m+n-1 = n ) or ( m ) values suffices to reconstruct the table. 2. Induction Hypothesis: Assume that for any ( k times l ) table where ( k + l < m + n ), knowing ( k + l - 1 ) values is sufficient to reconstruct the entire table. 3. Induction Step: Consider that in our current ( m times n ) table at least ( m + n - 1 ) numbers remain. Let us analyze a scenario where at least one number remains in each column and row (since ( m + n ) crosses ensure there is at least one number per row or column). 4. Remove a row and a column. The remaining table is now a ( (m-1) times (n-1) ) table, and it should satisfy the induction hypothesis as ( (m-1) + (n-1) < m + n ). 5. By induction, we can uniquely reconstruct this ( (m-1) times (n-1) ) table with the known values. Then, using the properties given in the problem about sums of opposite corners, we can reintroduce the removed row and column values correctly. Conclusion: Thus, the claim is established that observing ( m+n-1 ) numbers is necessary and sufficient to reconstruct the entire table uniquely.

This is because transitioning from ( 3^{k-1} ) to ( 3^k ) (which is a multiplication by 3) generally increases the number of digits unless (3^{k-1}) is already very close to the next power of 10 and starts with 1. 2.

Using the original price, the cost for A apples would be: Cost = A * P Using the reduced price, the cost for A + 64 apples would be: Cost = (A + 64) * R Since both costs are equal to Rs. 40, we can set up the following equation: A * P = (A + 64) * R Substituting R with 0.60P, we get: A * P = (A + 64) * 0.60P Dividing both sides by P, we get: A = (A + 64) * 0.60 Expanding the right side, we get: A = 0.60A + 38.4 Subtracting 0.60A from both sides, we get: 0.40A = 38.4 Dividing both sides by 0.40, we get: A = 38.4 / 0.40 A = 96 So, originally, the man could buy 96 apples for Rs. 40.

First, for the function f(x) = a^x to be decreasing on mathbb{R}, the base a must be between 0 and 1 (i.e., 0 < a < 1). This is because the derivative of f(x) = a^x with respect to x is f'(x) = (ln a) cdot a^x, which is negative if 0 < a < 1, indicating that the function is decreasing. Second, for the function g(x) = (2-a)x^3 to be increasing on mathbb{R}, the coefficient (2-a) must be positive; hence a must be less than 2 (i.e., a < 2). From these conditions, we can deduce that if 0 < a < 1, then it is guaranteed that a < 2.

However, the converse is not true; that is, if the function g(x) is increasing, it does not necessarily imply that f(x) is decreasing. For example, a could be between 1 and 2. In such a case, g(x) would still be increasing, while f(x) would be increasing as well, not decreasing.

According to the information given: - The table is 3 times the price of the chair, so the table costs 3C. - The couch is 5 times the price of the table, so the couch costs 5 * 3C = 15C. The total cost for all items is the sum of the costs of the chair, the table, and the couch: C + 3C + 15C = 380 Combining like terms, we get: 19C = 380 To find the price of the chair (C), we divide both sides of the equation by 19: C = 380 / 19 C = 20 Now that we know the price of the chair, we can find the price of the couch, which is 15 times the price of the chair: Price of the couch = 15 * C Price of the couch = 15 * 20 Price of the couch = 300 So, the price of the couch is boxed{300} ."},{"prompt":"A farmer wants to plough a farm field on time and must plough 340 hectares a day.

According to the plan, the farmer would plough ( 340 ) hectares a day for ( x ) days, so the total area he planned to plough would be ( 340x ). However, due to technical reasons, he ploughed only ( 85 ) hectares a day. Since he had to work 2 more days than planned, he actually worked for ( x + 2 ) days. Therefore, the total area he ploughed with the reduced capacity is ( 85(x + 2) ). We are given that the actual area of the farm field is ( 280 ) hectares. This means that the total area ploughed with the reduced capacity should be equal to or less than ( 280 ) hectares, because he still has some hectares left to plough.

Observing the structure, quadrilateral ( NBMD ) is part of the isosceles triangle. Using the properties of medians: - ( D ) splits ( AM ) and ( CN ) into segments with lengths in the ratio 2:1. - The properties of the centroid within the right-angled medians form a rectangle around point ( D ): two smaller triangles and a larger central quadrilateral which could be split into two right triangles. 4. **Quadrilateral and Triangles**: Using the fact that ( NBMD ) is formed by two right triangles within the isosceles triangle and combining them: - Each of these halves forms part of the larger area of the whole triangle, used to understand the overall base and heights involved. 5. **Using Properties and Trigonometry**: Now, observing that ( triangle ABC ) is isosceles and using trigonometry, given the specific conditions of the angles: - If ( angle B = pi - 2arctan(3) ). - Then the two base angles ( angle A ) and ( angle C ): [ angle A = angle C = arctan(3). ] 6. **Final Angles in the Triangle**: Therefore, summarizing the angles: [ boxed{angle A = angle C = arctan(3), quad angle B = pi - 2arctan(3).} ] 7. **Length of the Base**: Given the area condition, if area NBMD = 4, the corresponding calculations from segment relations of isosceles structure lead to the detailed segment length approaches, implying: [ boxed{4 text{ (since area interpretation confirmed).}} ] Conclusively, the angles of triangle ( ABC ) are: [ boxed{angle A = angle C = arctan(3), quad angle B = pi - 2arctan(3).} ] The base length calculation, interpreted by area: [ boxed{4.} ]"},{"prompt":"Consider the sequence starting at 8820, formed by repeatedly dividing by 5.

Since (a, b, c) are positive numbers, each term (frac{1}{a}, frac{1}{b}, frac{1}{c}) is also positive. Therefore, (a, b, c) must be greater than 1: [ a, b, c > 1. ] 5.

We can pair the terms in the series as follows: [ left( frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{p-1} right) + left( frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{p-2} right) + left( frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{p-3} right) + cdots ] 4. Recognize that each of these pairs can be combined into a fraction with common denominators: [ frac{1}{k} + frac{1}{p-k} = frac{p}{k(p-k)} ] for k = 1, 2, ldots, frac{p-1}{2}. 5. Thus, we can rewrite the sum as: [ frac{p}{1(p-1)} + frac{p}{2(p-2)} + frac{p}{3(p-3)} + cdots + frac{p}{frac{p-1}{2}frac{p+1}{2}} ] 6. Factoring out p from the sum, we have: [ p left( frac{1}{1(p-1)} + frac{1}{2(p-2)} + frac{1}{3(p-3)} + cdots + frac{1}{frac{p-1}{2}frac{p+1}{2}} right) ] 7. Now, consider the common denominator for these fractions. The best common denominator is the product of all the terms: [ 1(p-1) cdot 2(p-2) cdot 3(p-3) cdots left( frac{p-1}{2} right) left( frac{p+1}{2} right) = (p-1)! ] 8. Thus, we can express the sum in terms of a single fraction: [ frac{m}{n} = p cdot frac{q}{(p-1)!} ] where q in mathbb{N}. 9. From this relationship, we have: [ m (p-1)! = p q ] 10. Note that (p-1)! consists of the product of all integers from 1 to p-1. Since p is a prime and none of these integers are divisible by p, the only way this equation holds is if m is divisible by p. 11. Hence, we conclude that m (the numerator) must indeed be divisible by p.

If (3x_{1}x_{2})(x_{1}3x_{2})=19, find the value of k.","completion":"Given that the equation x^{2}+2kx+k^{2}=x+1 has two real roots, we can start by comparing it to the standard quadratic equation form and then proceed to find the conditions for k that ensure real roots. We also have the additional condition (3x_{1}-x_{2})(x_{1}-3x_{2})=19 to consider. Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Finding the Discriminant**: The equation can be rewritten as x^{2} + (2k-1)x + (k^{2}-1) = 0. For a quadratic equation ax^{2} + bx + c = 0, the discriminant Delta is given by Delta = b^{2} - 4ac. For real roots, Delta geq 0. Thus, for our equation: [ Delta = (2k-1)^{2} - 4(k^{2}-1) geq 0 ] Simplifying this gives us the condition for k to ensure the equation has real roots. 2. **Solving for k from the Discriminant**: By simplifying the inequality, we find the range of values for k that satisfy the condition for real roots. This step involves algebraic manipulation of the inequality obtained from the discriminant. 3. **Using the Relationship Between Roots and Coefficients**: The sum of the roots x_{1} + x_{2} = -frac{b}{a} = -(2k-1) and the product of the roots x_{1}x_{2} = frac{c}{a} = k^{2}-1. These relationships come from Vieta's formulas. 4. **Applying the Given Condition**: We are given that (3x_{1}-x_{2})(x_{1}-3x_{2})=19. Expanding and simplifying this expression using the relationships between roots and coefficients gives us another equation in terms of k. 5. **Solving the Equation in k**: By substituting x_{1} + x_{2} = -(2k-1) and x_{1}x_{2} = k^{2}-1 into the equation obtained from step 4 and simplifying, we get an equation solely in terms of k. Solving this equation gives us the possible values of k. 6. **Considering the Discriminant's Condition**: We must ensure that the values of k found also satisfy the condition obtained from the discriminant for the equation to have real roots. Following these steps, let's detail the solution: 1. The discriminant condition is: [ (2k-1)^{2} - 4(k^{2}-1) geq 0 ] which simplifies to a condition on k. 2. Solving the inequality gives us k leq frac{5}{4}. 3. From Vieta's formulas, we have: [ x_{1} + x_{2} = -(2k-1), quad x_{1}x_{2} = k^{2}-1 ] 4. Substituting these into the given condition and simplifying, we get: [ 3left(2k-1right)^{2} - 16(k^{2}-1) - 19 = 0 ] 5. Solving this equation for k, we find: [ k^{2} + 3k = 0 ] which gives k_{1} = 0 and k_{2} = -3. 6. Considering the discriminant's condition, we conclude: [ boxed{k = 0 text{ or } k = -3} ] This step-by-step breakdown adheres closely to the original solution, detailing the calculation steps and encapsulating the final answer as required."},{"prompt":"Carmen is creating lollipop bouquets using 4 cherry lollipops, 6 orange lollipops, 8 raspberry lollipops, 10 lemon lollipops, 12 candy canes, and 14 chocolate coins as decorations.

The quantities Carmen has are: - 4 cherry lollipops - 6 orange lollipops - 8 raspberry lollipops - 10 lemon lollipops - 12 candy canes - 14 chocolate coins Let's find the GCD of these numbers: GCD(4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) First, we can list the factors of each number: - Factors of 4: 1, 2, 4 - Factors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6 - Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8 - Factors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10 - Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 - Factors of 14: 1, 2, 7, 14 The common factors among all these numbers are 1 and 2.

Show that no equilateral triangle inscribed in an ellipse (with unequal axes) or circumscribed around it can have its center coincide with the center of the ellipse.","completion":"1. **Initial Assumption**: Assume that the center of an equilateral triangle inscribed in an ellipse (with unequal axes) coincides with the center of the ellipse. 2. **Geometric Consequence**: If the centers coincide, both the ellipse and the circumcircle of the equilateral triangle would be concentric. 3. **Intersection Points**: Consider the four intersection points between the ellipse and the circumcircle. These points should form the vertices of some rectangle. To see why this is true, recall that a circle and an ellipse with the same center intersect in four points which lie symmetrically with respect to both the major and minor axes, forming the vertices of a rectangle. 4. **Contradiction**: However, we are dealing with an equilateral triangle, whose vertices cannot simultaneously be three vertices of any rectangle, as the symmetry of an equilateral triangle does not match the symmetry required to form a rectangle. Since our initial assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false. 5. **Case of Circumscribed Ellipse**: Suppose we have an ellipse circumscribed around an equilateral triangle. In this situation, if the centers coincide, each chord through the center (from one vertex to the opposite side, passing through the center) would be bisected by the ellipse. This can only happen if each vertex of the triangle lies on an extension of one of the main axes of the ellipse. However, for an equilateral triangle, no two vertices can lie on the same straight line passing through the ellipse's center. 6. **Conclusion**: Since neither case (inscribed or circumscribed equilateral triangle) allows the centers to coincide without leading to a contradiction, we conclude that the center of an equilateral triangle inscribed in or circumscribed around an ellipse cannot coincide with the center of the ellipse.

In this system, all points on its circumference move with the same speed ( v ). 4. **Calculate the Velocities**: - The point of contact between the larger roller and the plate moves with velocity ( v ) at an angle (alpha) to the horizontal. - Similarly, the point of contact between the smaller roller and the surface also moves with velocity ( v ). 5. **Analyze the Motion of the Plate**: - Move to a reference frame associated with the horizontal surface. - In this frame, the plate undergoes both translational and rotational motion. 6. **Determine the Acceleration**: From the principle of energy conservation: - As the plate descends, it gains kinetic energy equivalent to the potential energy lost: [ Delta E = mgh = frac{1}{2}mv^2 ] Equating potential energy loss to kinetic energy gain: [ mgh = frac{1}{2}mv^2 implies gh = frac{v^2}{2} implies v^2 = 2gh ] To find ( h ): [ h = frac{h}{sin(alpha)} implies h = R(1 - cos(alpha)) ] 7. **Final Expression for Acceleration**: Since displacement ( s ) is ( frac{h}{sin(alpha / 2)} ), using the kinematic equation ( 2as = v^2 ): [ 2a left( frac{h}{sin(alpha/2)} right) = 2gh implies a = g sin(alpha/2) ] 8. **Given (cos(alpha) = 0.98)**: [ sin(alpha / 2) = sqrt{frac{1 - cos(alpha)}{2}} = sqrt{frac{1 - 0.98}{2}} = sqrt{frac{0.02}{2}} = sqrt{0.01} = 0.1 ] Therefore, [ a = g sin(alpha / 2) = g times 0.1 = 10 times 0.1 = 1 , text{m/s}^2 ] # Conclusion: - The magnitude of the acceleration of the plate is (1 , text{m/s}^2). - The direction of the acceleration is (alpha / 2 = arcsin(0.1)).

Prove that the elements in ( S ) can be divided into several groups such that: 1. Each element in ( S ) belongs to one and only one of these groups; 2. For each group, the angle between any complex number in that group and the sum of all complex numbers in that group does not exceed ( 90^circ ); 3. The angle between the sums of complex numbers in any two different groups is greater than ( 90^circ ).","completion":"Step 1: Initialization 1. Given a set ( S = {z_1, z_2, cdots, z_{1993}}) where ( z_1, z_2, cdots, z_{1993} ) are non-zero complex numbers (or equivalently, non-zero vectors in the plane). 2. Our goal is to partition ( S ) into several groups satisfying the following conditions: - Each element of ( S ) belongs to, and only belongs to, exactly one group. - The sum of the elements in any group does not form an angle greater than ( 90^circ ) with any individual element of the same group. - The sum of the elements of any two groups forms an angle greater than ( 90^circ ) with each other. Step 2: Identify subset (A) 3. Since the number of subsets of ( S ) is finite, there exists at least one subset ( A subset S ) such that the magnitude of the sum of vectors in ( A ) is the maximum among all subsets of ( S ). Denote this sum by ( boldsymbol{a} ). Step 3: Rotating coordinate axes 4. Rotate the coordinate axes such that the vector ( boldsymbol{a} ) points in the positive direction of the ( y )-axis. Step 4: Exemplifying (A) 5. Claim: ( A ) must be composed of all vectors in ( S ) that are in the upper half-plane after the rotation. This is because: - If there exists a vector ( boldsymbol{p} ) in the upper half-plane but ( boldsymbol{p} notin A ), then adding ( boldsymbol{p} ) to ( A ) would increase the ( y )-component of the sum, contradicting the maximality of ( |boldsymbol{a}| ). - Similarly, if there exists a vector ( boldsymbol{q} ) in the lower half-plane and ( boldsymbol{q} in A ), then removing ( boldsymbol{q} ) from ( A ) would decrease the ( y )-component of the sum, again contradicting the maximality of ( |boldsymbol{a}| ). Therefore, ( A ) is precisely the set of all vectors in ( S ) that lie in the upper half-plane after the rotation. Step 5: Identifying (B) and further partitioning (C) 6. The set ( S - A ) then contains all vectors that lie in the lower half-plane after the rotation. This set is non-empty and can be partitioned further. 7. In ( S - A ), there must exist a subset ( B ) such that the magnitude of the sum of its vectors is maximum among all subsets of ( S - A ), denote this sum by ( boldsymbol{b} ). Step 6: Analysis of subset (B) 8. Rotate again so that ( boldsymbol{b} ) lies along the positive direction of a new coordinate axis. 9. Subset ( B ) must consist of vectors whose direction lies within a certain acute angular region around ( boldsymbol{b} ). Step 7: Definition of Subset (C) 10.

The groups ( A, B, C ) as constructed meet the problem conditions.

The increment from ( n ) to ( n+1 ) will increase both ( n ) and the last digit by 1, thus: [ f(n+1) = (n + 1) + text{sum of digits of } (n + 1) ] Given the last digit isn't 9, the digits increase by 1, so: [ text{sum of digits of } (n + 1) = (text{sum of digits of } n) + 1 ] Thus: [ f(n+1) = f(n) + 2 ] - If the last digit of ( n ) is 9, adding 1 causes a carry over, resetting the last digit to 0 and increasing the digit in the tens place: [ f(n+1) = (n + 1) + text{sum of digits of } (n + 1) ] The carry-over results in: [ text{sum of digits of } (n + 1) < text{sum of digits of } n ] Making ( f(n+1) < f(n) ). 3. **Arbitarily Large Values**: Function ( f(n) ) achieves arbitrarily large values because as ( n ) increases without bound, the sum of its digits also increases, ensuring that ( f(n) to infty ). 4. **Base Case**: [ f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 ] 5. **Inductive Argument for ( m > 1 )**: - Let ( m ) be any positive integer. - Define ( M ) as the smallest integer such that ( f(M) > m ). - ( f ) is injective and increasing when the last digit is not 9, so: [ f(M-1) leq m < f(M) ] - As discussed, ( f(M) - f(M-1) ) can be at most 2, meaning: [ f(M) = f(M-1) + 2 ] - If ( f(M-1) = m ) or ( f(M) = m + 1 ), at least one of these conditions is satistfied. # Conclusion Thus, for any given positive integer ( m ), we can find ( n ) such that ( f(n) = m ) or ( f(n) = m+1 ).

Specifically, - considering circles with centers at ( A ) and ( B ) (with corresponding tangents), we draw the tangent at point ( P ). 4. **Consider Parallel Tangents:** The parallel tangent lines intersect the shape at points, forming parallel tangent lines to each part of the shape. They cross the centers and the points of tangency on the shape at circles of radii 5 and 1 units, equidistant from the triangular structure. 5. **Calculation of the Strip Width:** - The centers of the circles are at opposite ends of the equilateral triangle, thus forming tangents exactly aligning with the sides of the triangle and extending outward. - Consequently, the distance between two parallel lines that are tangent to the outermost parts of two arcs will be the sum of the radii of these circles: Approximatively (5 text{ units (radius)} + 1 text{ unit (radius)} = 6 text{ units}). 6. **Conclusion:** Since the shape must fit into any strip bound by two parallel lines, the narrowest such strip has to accommodate the maximum distance between these parallel tangents, which is ( 6 text{ units}).

Since (A) and (G) are at opposite ends of a unit cube, we calculate the length of ( AG ). In a unit cube, the coordinates of ( A ) can be taken as ((0,0,0)) and ( G ) as ((1,1,1)). The length of the diagonal ( AG ) is: [ AG = sqrt{(1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = sqrt{1 + 1 + 1} = sqrt{3} ] 3. **Rotation Symmetry Argument:** By rotating the cube about ( AG ) by (120^circ), both planes (S_{A}) and (S_{G}) map onto themselves. Thus, both planes are perpendicular to the space diagonal ( AG ). Due to cube's symmetric nature, the distance from (A) to the plane (S_{A}) equals the distance from (G) to the plane (S_{G}), providing both planes divide the diagonal into equal segments. 4. **Distance Division:** Since each such rotation keeps ( AG ) invariant and divides it into three equal parts.

The maximum occurs at the left endpoint x=1 due to the monotonic decrease: - At x=1, y_{max}=y|_{x=1}=1^{2}-log _{a}(2)-4(1)+4=1-log _{a}(2). - Requiring that y_{max} leq 0 leads to 1-log _{a}(2) leq 0, or log _{a}(2) geq 1. 3. **Solving for a:** - The inequality log _{a}(2) geq 1 can be rewritten as a^{1} geq 2, giving a geq 2. - However, considering the overall conditions and the behavior of the function, we refine this to 1 < a leq 2 to satisfy the problem's requirements.

First, we need to find the natural exponent ( k ) for the number 5 such that ( 5^k - 1 ) is divisible by ( 2^{100} ). By the LTE (Lifting The Exponent) Lemma, we can use this to find the largest power of ( 2 ) that divides ( 5^k - 1 ). 2. According to the Lifting The Exponent Lemma, if ( n = 2^a cdot b ) with ( a geq 2 ) and ( b ) an odd number, then [ v_2(m^n - 1) = v_2(m - 1) + v_2(m + 1) + v_2(n) - 1 ] where ( v_2(x) ) denotes the exponent of the highest power of ( 2 ) dividing ( x ). 3. Considering ( m = 5 ) and ( n = k ): - ( 5^k - 1 ) can be expressed in terms of powers of ( 2 ), - To satisfy condition ( v_2(5^k - 1) geq 100 ), since ( 5 equiv 1 mod 4 ), - We need ( k ) such that ( 5^k equiv 1 mod 2^{100} ). 4. Next, consider the number ( A = 5^{k+100} ). The difference ( A - 5^{100} ) is: [ A - 5^{100} = 5^{100} (5^k - 1) ] 5. Since ( 5^k - 1 ) is divisible by ( 2^{100} ), the term ( 5^{100} (5^k - 1) ) is divisible by: [ 5^{100} cdot 2^{100} = (5 cdot 2)^{100} = 10^{100} ] 6. This implies that ( A - 5^{100} ) is divisible by ( 10^{100} ). Hence, the last 100 digits of ( A ) must match the last 100 digits of ( 5^{100} ). 7. We need to ensure that ( 5^{100} ) has at least 30 consecutive zeroes in its last 100 digits. Let’s examine the magnitude: - ( 5^{100} ), - We know ( 5^{100} < 10^{70} ) because ( 2^{100} = 1024^{10} > 10^{30} = 2^{30} cdot 5^{30} implies 2^{70} > 5^{30} ). 8. Hence, there must be fewer than 100 digits in the decimal expansion of ( 5^{100} ). Thus, the analysis shows that the leading digits ( 5^{100} ) do not form a large number as compared to the digits needed for larger powers. Conclusion: Given the magnitude checks, we conclude that natural powers of 5 cannot have at least 30 consecutive zeros in the last 100 digits of their decimal representation.

Let (A) be an adjacent vertex to (A^{*}) on the top face and let the angles (A A^{*} B^{*} = A A^{*} D^{*} = B^{*} A^{*} D^{*} = alpha). Exclude the case where (alpha = 90^{circ}) as it leads to a cube. 2. **Calculating the Height**: - The height (m) of (P) is the distance from (A) to its projection (A') on the plane (H). We will demonstrate that (A') lies on the diagonal (A^{*}C^{*}): - Since the angles between the originating edges at (A^{*}) are equal, rotating the (A^{*}B^{*}A) plane around the (A^{*}B^{*}) edge leads to (A) passing through (D^{*}). The plane (S) of this rotation is perpendicular to (H), as (H) contains the rotation axis. Thus, the projection of (A) onto (H) will always lie on the line perpendicular to (A^{*}B^{*}), passing through (D^{*}), denoted as (g). - Similarly, due to symmetry, (A') lies on the line through (B^{*}), perpendicular to (A^{*}D^{*}). - Therefore, (A') is the orthocenter of triangle (A^{*}B^{*}D^{*}), passing through the altitude from (A^{*}), which is also the diagonal (A^{*}C^{*}) due to (A^{*}B^{*} = A^{*}D^{*}). - Consequently, (A') lies on the line (A^{*}C^{*}). 3. **Determining Lengths**: - Let (E) be the point where the plane (S) intersects (A^{*}B^{*}). Then, the height is given by: [ m = A A' = sqrt{A E^2 - A' E^2} ] - In the right triangles (AA^{*}E) and (D^{*}A^{*}E), angle at (A^{*} = alpha) or (180^{circ} - alpha) if (alpha > 90^{circ}): [ A E = a sin alpha, quad A^{*} E = |a cos alpha| ] where (a) is the side length of the rhombus faces. In right triangle (A' A^{*} E), angle at (A^{*}) is (alpha / 2): [ A' E = A^{*} E cdot tan(alpha / 2) ] 4. **Height Calculation**: - Substituting these values, we get: [ m = sqrt{a^{2} sin^{2} alpha - a^{2} cos^{2} alpha tan^{2} (alpha / 2)} ] 5. **Volume Calculation**: - The area of the base is (a^{2} sin alpha), so the volume (V) is: [ V = V(a, alpha) = a^{3} sin alpha sqrt{sin^{2} alpha - cos^{2} alpha tan^{2} (alpha / 2)} ] 6. **Simplifying the Expression**: - We simplify the term under the square root using trigonometric identities. Let (cos(alpha / 2) = c) and (tan(alpha / 2) = t). Using identities (cos 2x = 2cos^{2} x - 1) and (sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x): [ sin alpha = frac{2 t}{1 + t^{2}}, quad cos alpha = frac{1 - t^{2}}{1 + t^{2}} ] Then: [ V = a^{3} sin alpha tan(alpha / 2) sqrt{1 + 2 cos alpha} = 2 a^{3} sin^{2} (alpha / 2) sqrt{1 + 2 cos alpha} ] 7. **Constraints for Valid Construction**: - For a valid parallelepiped construction (alpha < 120^{circ}). This is because the angles between rhombuses should remain less than (120^{circ}) to form a closed, three-dimensional figure. 8. **Expression in Terms of Diagonals**: - Let (e) and (f) be diagonals of the rhombus: [ a = frac{1}{2} sqrt{e^{2} + f^{2}}, quad tan frac{alpha}{2} = frac{f}{e} ] Using these and the properties of rhombus heights and areas: [ V = V(e, f) = frac{f}{8e} (e^{2} + f^{2}) sqrt{3e^{2} - f^{2}} ] This renders the volume explicitly in terms of the diagonals of the rhombus faces.

Importantly, note that: [ 999 = 3^3 cdot 37 ] So, ( 999 ) is divisible by ( 37 ). Therefore, each term of the form ( a_i (10^{3k} - 1) ) in ( S ) (for ( 2 leq k leq 889 )) is divisible by ( 37 ). Now, we focus on the sum of all three-digit numbers from ( 111 ) to ( 999 ): [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{889} = 111 + 112 + cdots + 999 ] To verify that this sum is divisible by ( 37 ), let's sum the pairwise elements symmetrically: [ (111 + 999), (112 + 998), (113 + 997), ldots ] Each pair sums to ( 1110 ): [ 111 + 999 = 1110, quad 112 + 998 = 1110, quad 113 + 997 = 1110, quad ldots ] There are ( 444 ) pairs of numbers, and one middle element since there is an odd count of numbers: [ 889 = 444 times 2 + 1 ] Let find that central (or middle) number, it is the ( 445 )th number in the sequence: [ 111 + 444 = 555 ] Both ( 1110 ) and ( 555 ) are divisible by ( 37 ): [ 1110 div 37 = 30, quad 555 div 37 = 15 ] Summarizing, the entire sum of the numbers: [ 444 times 1110 + 555 ] is divisible by ( 37 ). Therefore, the sum of all three-digit numbers from ( 111 ) to ( 999 ) is divisible by ( 37 ). Combining with the previous finding, the entire sum ( S ) is also divisible by ( 37 ): [ S = (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{889}) + a_2 (10^3 - 1) + a_3 (10^6 - 1) + cdots + a_{889} (10^{2664} - 1) ] Since every term in ( S ) is divisible by ( 37 ), we conclude that ( S ) itself is divisible by ( 37 ): [ boxed{S text{ is divisible by 37}} ]"},{"prompt":"f 12^{4n} = left(frac{1}{12}right)^{n 30}, find n.","completion":"1.

We can solve for N by cross-multiplying: 24 * 8 > 5 * N 192 > 5N Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for N: 192/5 > N 38.4 > N Since the number of non-managers must be a whole number, we take the largest whole number less than 38.4, which is 38.

We can choose the first shoe from any of the 4 remaining pairs, giving us 4 choices. After selecting the first shoe, we have 3 pairs left to choose the second shoe from, giving us 3 choices.

Since there are 4 rows and 4 columns, the sum of all rows or all columns is: [ 4x = 72 ] Solving for x gives: [ x = frac{72}{4} = 18 ] 3. **Verification for Diagonals:** The sum along each diagonal must also be 18 for the arrangement to be consistent, aligning with the total sum equally divided among rows and columns. 4. **Conclusion:** The value of the common sum for each row, each column, and each diagonal in the 4 times 4 square matrix of integers from -3 to 12 is 18.

Observe that the triangle formed by the centers of the three circles ( C_1, C_2, ) and ( C_3 ) is equilateral. This is because the centers of the circles form an equilateral triangle, as each pair of circles are tangent to each other. 2. The distance between the centers of any two circles ( C_i ) and ( C_j ) is ( 2r ), because each pair of circles is externally tangent, thus the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii. 3. Each pair of circles has two common external tangents, and the segments connecting the points of tangency form the sides of the triangle we need to find the area of. 4. To find the side of this triangle, note that the side of the triangle formed by the tangents outside the circles can be calculated as follows. The length of each tangent segment between two circles is given by: [ r + rsqrt{3} + rsqrt{3} + r = 2r(sqrt{3} + 1) ] 5. Thus, the side length of our equilateral triangle is ( 2r(sqrt{3} + 1) ). 6. Now, we use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle given its side length ( a = 2r(sqrt{3} + 1) ): [ text{Area} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^2 ] 7. Substituting ( a = 2r(sqrt{3} + 1) ) into the formula: [ text{Area} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} left( 2r(sqrt{3} + 1) right)^2 ] 8. Simplifying the expression inside the square: [ left( 2r(sqrt{3} + 1) right)^2 = 4r^2 (sqrt{3} + 1)^2 ] 9. Continuing with the simplification: [ (sqrt{3} + 1)^2 = 3 + 2sqrt{3} + 1 = 4 + 2sqrt{3} ] 10. Thus: [ left( 2r(sqrt{3} + 1) right)^2 = 4r^2 (4 + 2sqrt{3}) = 16r^2 + 8sqrt{3}r^2 ] 11.

By analogous reasoning to the steps above, these points will coincide if: [ AD - AB = CD - CB ] - Since the given condition AB - BC = AD - DC is equivalent to the above condition (with simple rearrangement and sign changes), it follows that the tangency of the incircles of triangle ABD and triangle BCD traces from the initial condition. # Conclusion: Thus, the incircles of triangles ABD and BCD are also tangent to each other. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"f a > b > 0, and m > 0, determine the relationship between frac{b}{a} and frac{b+m}{a+m}, and provide a proof.","completion":"Solution: frac{b}{a} < frac{b+m}{a+m}, the proof is as follows; Subtracting, we get; frac{b}{a} - frac{b+m}{a+m} = frac{b(a+m)-a(b+m)}{a(a+m)} = frac{bm-am}{a(a+m)} = frac{m(b-a)}{a(a+m)}; Since a > b > 0, and m > 0, it follows that b-a < 0, and a+m > 0, thus frac{m(b-a)}{a(a+m)} < 0; Therefore, boxed{frac{b}{a} < frac{b+m}{a+m}}."},{"prompt":"Car A runs at the speed of 50 km/hr and reaches its destination in 8 hours.

Since A can give C a 200 meters start, this means that if A and C were to race, A would finish 200 meters ahead of C in a 1000 meter race. Now, we are told that B can give C a 157.89473684210532 meters start. This means that if B and C were to race, B would finish 157.89473684210532 meters ahead of C in a 1000 meter race. Since A is faster than B (because A can give B a start), and B is faster than C, we can infer that A is also faster than C. The difference in the start that A can give C and the start that B can give C will be the start that A can give B. So, we can calculate the start that A can give B by subtracting the start that B can give C from the start that A can give C: ( x = 200 - 157.89473684210532 ) ( x = 42.10526315789468 ) meters Therefore, A can give B a start of approximately boxed{42.10526315789468} meters in a kilometer race."},{"prompt":"Kelly has 50 Nintendo games.

Every two of them share a common vertex. 2. At each vertex, the same number (k) of triangles meet. Find all values of (k) and (n) under which this arrangement is possible. 1. **Define (k) and prove (k leq 3):** Let's denote (k) as the number of triangles meeting at one vertex. We will show that (k leq 3). Assume (k > 3). We will label our triangles with Roman numerals, and their vertices with Arabic numerals. Consider one of the triangles, say triangle (I), having vertices labeled 1, 2, and 3. Since we assume (k > 3), at vertex 1 of triangle (I), there are at least three other triangles (since (k > 3)), which we will number (II, III), and (IV). These triangles must share vertex 1 with triangle (I). Let triangle (V) be a triangle that shares vertex 2 with triangle (I). Triangle (V) must be different from triangles (I, II, III) and (IV), as if it were the same, it would share two vertices with triangle (I), which is not allowed (else it would have two common vertices with (I), i.e., 1 and 2). According to the problem, each of triangles (I, II, III,) and (IV) must have a vertex in common with triangle (V), which cannot be vertex 2 (otherwise, one of triangles (II, III,) or (IV) would have two common vertices with (I), i.e., 1 and 2). Thus, at least two of the triangles (II, III,) and (IV) must share the same vertex as triangle (I), which is a contradiction because two triangles cannot share more than one vertex. Thus, (k > 3) is not possible, so (k) can only be 1, 2, or 3. 2. **Excluding trivial case (k=1):** The case (k = 1) is trivial as it implies only one triangle exists (otherwise, each pair of triangles would have to share a vertex, which means (k) couldn't be 1). Thus, we ignore this case. 3. **Case (k=2):** Suppose (k=2). This means two triangles meet at each vertex. Consider a triangle (I) with vertices 1, 2, and 3. Since (k=2), each vertex must be shared with another triangle. Thus, there must be a triangle sharing vertices with triangle (I), creating a scenario of: - Three triangles sharing edges with each vertex of triangle (I) leading to a total of: [ text{Total triangles} = 3(k-1) + 1 = 3 cdot 1 + 1 = 4 ] Thus (n = 4) when (k=2). 4. **Case (k=3):** Suppose (k=3).

The double-angle formula states that cos(2alpha) = 2cos^2(alpha) - 1.

A number is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9. Let's address these divisibility rules one by one. 1. **Divisibility by 2**: - A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. - From the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the even digits are 2, 4, 6, and 8. - Therefore, there are 4 options for the last digit (the 12-th position). 2. **Divisibility by 9**: - A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. - The given number is 2 * 0 * 1 * 6 * 0 * 2 *.

Let's denote these new digits as d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, with d_5 being the digit that ensures divisibility by 2. Thus the sum of all the digits would be: [ 11 + d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 equiv 0 pmod{9} ] To find out how many ways we can select these five digits such that the sum is a multiple of 9, we note: - Each of d_1, d_2, d_3, and d_4 can be any digit from 1 to 9. - There are 9^4 ways to choose these four digits independently, since each has 9 possible values. The fifth digit d_5 is uniquely determined such that the sum is a multiple of 9. This selection assures correct sum modulo 9. Thus: [ 11 + d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5 equiv 0 pmod{9} ] Simplified, knowing equivalency modulo 9: [ (d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5) equiv (-11) pmod{9} ] Simplified reducing out sum from above. 3. **Combining both conditions**: - We now calculate the total number of ways to assign the four d_i and adjust for the final check (divisible by 9). - For d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, these digits have 9^4 combinations and d_5 fixes in 4 choices above.

An edge between two vertices ( a ) and ( b ) exists if there are two corresponding points (one on ( l_1 ), the other on ( l_2 )) of colors ( a ) and ( b ). 4. **Degree analysis**: - If one vertex has degree 0, it implies that all 25 points on ( l_1 ) of the color considered have corresponding points of the same color on ( l_2 ).

We need to prove that there is a point in ( S ) such that: - The point falls inside the triangle ( BCD ). - No line segment connecting any two vertices of ( BCD ) passes through the point. **Proof by Cases**: - Let ( C ) be the \\"middle\\" point based on the x-coordinate values among the vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ). If ( B_x le C_x le D_x ) or ( D_x le C_x le B_x ), then ( C ) is the middle point. Its corresponding point in ( S ) which is just above or below ( C ) based on its location in ( P ) would lie inside ( BCD ). - This point will naturally be inside the triangle since it is chosen to be directly vertical to one of the vertices of the triangle thereby lying within the bounds of the triangle. - Now, if ( C = A ) or ( C = Z ), note that as the middle point's abscissa is between that of ( B ) and ( D ), neither ( A ) nor ( Z ) can be placed such that no other point can be chosen between ( B ), ( C ) and ( D ). 5. **Final Consideration**: Having established that each chosen point for ( S ) is valid and ensures that any triangle formed by the vertices of ( P ) contains exactly one point from ( S ) inside it, and not shared by sides formed by any vertex pairs, ( S ) appropriately satisfies the condition.

Let's proceed to detail each step: 1. **Expression for MN in terms of triangle sides and angles**: The distance MN in the right triangle ANM can be expressed using trigonometric functions. We establish the following relationship: [ MN = AM cdot sin varphi ] where varphi is the angle (Ahat{M}N). Let's find varphi in terms of known angles. 2. **Finding angle varphi**: [ varphi = frac{alpha}{2} - left( 90^circ - beta right) = frac{alpha + 2beta - 180^circ}{2} ] 3. **Simplify varphi**: Using the angle sum property of a triangle: [ alpha + beta + gamma = 180^circ ] Hence, [ varphi = frac{beta - gamma}{2} ] 4. **Finding length AM in terms of triangle sides**: The height AM in the right triangle triangle AMC_1 (where C_1 is the foot of the perpendicular AM from A to the side BC) is given by: [ AM = frac{AC_1}{sin beta} ] and [ AC_1 = b cos alpha ] 5. **Combining the expressions**: Substituting AM back into our equation for MN: [ MN = frac{b cos alpha}{sin beta} sin frac{beta - gamma}{2} ] 6. **Substitute MN into original condition**: [ 2 cdot frac{b cos alpha}{sin beta} sin frac{beta - gamma}{2} = b - c ] 7. **Applying the Sinus theorem**: By the sinus theorem: [ c = frac{b sin gamma}{sin beta} ] Therefore: [ b - c = b - frac{b sin gamma}{sin beta} = b frac{sin beta - sin gamma}{sin beta} ] 8. **Equating and simplifying with trigonometric identities**: [ frac{2 b cos alpha sin frac{beta - gamma}{2}}{sin beta} = b frac{sin beta - sin gamma}{sin beta} ] Simplify by dividing through by b/sin beta: [ 2 cos alpha sin frac{beta - gamma}{2} = sin beta - sin gamma ] Using the trigonometric identity for the difference of sines: [ sin beta - sin gamma = 2 cos frac{beta + gamma}{2} sin frac{beta - gamma}{2} ] So: [ 2 cos alpha sin frac{beta - gamma}{2} = 2 cos frac{beta + gamma}{2} sin frac{beta - gamma}{2} ] If sin frac{beta - gamma}{2} neq 0 (i.e., beta neq gamma and therefore, the triangle is not isosceles): [ cos alpha = cos frac{beta + gamma}{2} ] Since beta + gamma = 180^circ - alpha, we have: [ cos alpha = sin frac{alpha}{2} ] Rewriting in terms of sin: [ cos alpha = 1 - 2 sin^2 frac{alpha}{2} ] 9. **Solving the resulting quadratic equation**: Let x = sin frac{alpha}{2}: [ 2x^2 + x - 1 = 0 ] Solving using the quadratic formula: [ x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 8}}{4} = frac{-1 pm 3}{4} ] Taking the positive root: [ x = frac{1}{2} ] Therefore: [ sin frac{alpha}{2} = frac{1}{2} ] 10. **Concluding the value of alpha**: [ frac{alpha}{2} = 30^circ implies alpha = 60^circ ] Thus, the measure of the angle alpha is: [boxed{60^circ}]"},{"prompt":"wel , when bleached , lost 30 % of its length and 25 % of its breadth . what is the percentage decrease in area ?","completion":"Let's assume the original length of the towel is L and the original breadth is B.

The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in ( S ). 2. **Initial Elements and Sum-Completeness:** Since ({1, 3} subset S), the sums of subsets of ( S ) must include (1), (3), and (1+3=4).

The sums of subsets of ( S ) are: [ {1, 2, 3, 7, 1+2=3, 1+3=4, 1+7=8, 2+3=5, 2+7=9, 3+7=10, 1+2+3=6, 1+2+7=10, 1+3+7=11, 2+3+7=12, 1+2+3+7=13} ] So, the sums range from (1) to (13). 5. **Adding Subsequent Elements:** To continue extending the range, the next element should be (14) (the smallest integer greater than (13)).

What were her original savings before making these purchases?","completion":"Let's denote Linda's original savings as S. She spent 3/4 of her savings on furniture, so the amount spent on furniture before the discount is (3/4)S. The rest of her savings, which is 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 of her savings, was spent on the TV and the refrigerator. So, the amount spent on the TV and refrigerator before any tax or additional cost is (1/4)S. The TV cost her 210 before tax. The tax on the TV is 6%, so the tax amount is 0.06 * 210 = 12.60. Therefore, the total cost of the TV including tax is 210 + 12.60 = 222.60. The refrigerator cost 20% more than the TV. The cost of the TV before tax is 210, so 20% of this is 0.20 * 210 = 42. Therefore, the cost of the refrigerator is 210 + 42 = 252. Now, let's calculate the total cost of the TV and refrigerator together: 222.60 (TV with tax) + 252 (refrigerator) = 474.60. This amount (474.60) is equal to 1/4 of her savings (1/4)S. So, we can set up the equation: (1/4)S = 474.60 To find her original savings S, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4: S = 4 * 474.60 S = 1898.40 Now, we need to account for the 7% discount on the furniture. The cost of the furniture before the discount is (3/4)S, which is (3/4) * 1898.40 = 1423.80. The discount amount on the furniture is 7% of 1423.80, which is 0.07 * 1423.80 = 99.666. The actual amount Linda spent on the furniture after the discount is 1423.80 - 99.666 = 1324.134.

A: Plane figures that can overlap are congruent figures. B: Two figures that are symmetric about a line are congruent figures. C: Two equilateral triangles with equal side lengths are congruent figures. D: Figures with axial symmetry are congruent figures.","completion":"To solve this problem, let's analyze each statement one by one to determine which one is incorrect. - **Statement A**: It says that plane figures that can overlap are congruent figures. This statement is based on the definition of congruent figures. Congruent figures are those that can be made to coincide with one another by a series of rigid transformations, including translation (sliding), rotation, and reflection. If two plane figures can overlap perfectly, it means every corresponding part matches, which is the definition of congruency. Therefore, statement A is correct. - **Statement B**: This statement mentions that two figures that are symmetric about a line are congruent figures. Line symmetry implies that one figure can be reflected across a line to perfectly match the other figure. This is a characteristic of congruent figures, as congruency includes the ability to match through reflections. Thus, statement B is also correct. - **Statement C**: It states that two equilateral triangles with equal side lengths are congruent figures. In geometry, two triangles are congruent if all their corresponding sides and angles are equal. For equilateral triangles, all sides are of equal length by definition, and all internal angles are 60 degrees. Therefore, if two equilateral triangles have equal side lengths, they are congruent. This makes statement C correct. - **Statement D**: This statement claims that figures with axial symmetry are congruent figures. Axial symmetry refers to symmetry around an axis; a figure exhibits axial symmetry if it can be divided into two parts that are mirror images of each other. However, the statement is misleading because it seems to imply that the symmetry makes two separate figures congruent, when in fact, axial symmetry refers to the characteristics of one figure, not a relationship between two figures. Therefore, this statement is incorrect because it misrepresents the concept of congruency as it applies to the relationship between two separate figures, not the symmetry properties of a single figure. Given the analysis, the incorrect statement is: boxed{D} Figures with axial symmetry are congruent figures, is the incorrect statement because it confuses the concept of symmetry within one figure with the concept of congruency between two figures."},{"prompt":"A boys' camp and a girls' camp are located at distances of 240 rods and 320 rods respectively from the same point on a straight road.

Consider the vertices (A_i) and (A_j) that lie on one side of the plane (A_2A_3A_5).

Then the tetrahedra (A_1A_2A_3A_5) and (A_1A_3A_5A_4) are congruent. 3. Because (A_i) and (A_j) lie on opposite sides of the plane (A_2A_3A_5) and are vertices of an equilateral triangle (A_2A_3A_5), point (A_1) and (A_4) are symmetric relative to the plane passing through the midpoints of the edges (A_2A_3) perpendicular to it. 4.

Given that f(2a) + f(b-4) = 0, we have f(2a) = -f(b-4) = f(4-b), which implies 2a = 4-b, or equivalently, 2a + b = 4. We want to minimize dfrac{1}{a} + dfrac{2}{b}. Using 2a + b = 4, we get: dfrac{1}{a} + dfrac{2}{b} = dfrac{2a+b}{2ab} = dfrac{4}{2ab} = dfrac{1}{2ab} + dfrac{2}{2ab} = 1 + dfrac{1}{2} cdot left(dfrac{2b}{2a} + dfrac{2a}{b}right). Applying the AM-GM inequality to dfrac{b}{2a} and dfrac{2a}{b}, we have: dfrac{1}{2} cdot left(dfrac{b}{2a} + dfrac{2a}{b}right) geq dfrac{1}{2} cdot 2sqrt{dfrac{b}{2a} cdot dfrac{2a}{b}} = 1. So, dfrac{1}{a} + dfrac{2}{b} geq 2. Equality holds when dfrac{b}{2a} = dfrac{2a}{b}, which happens when b = 2a.

What is the maximum number of consecutive numbers that can be new?","completion":"To determine the largest number of consecutive natural numbers greater than 5 that can all be considered \\"new\\" (as defined in the problem statement), we will first review the definition and then analyze the numbers systematically. **Definition:** A natural number ( n > 5 ) is called \\"new\\" if there exists a number that is not a multiple of ( n ) but is a multiple of all natural numbers less than ( n ). 1. **Consideration of Individual Numbers:** - **For ( n = 7 ):** [ text{Numbers less than } 7 text{ are } 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, text{ and } 6. ] The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is ( text{LCM}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 60 ).

According to the solution, numbers in the form ( n = 4k + 2 ) (which can be simplified to ( n equiv 2 pmod{4} )) cannot be \\"new\\" because any number that is a multiple of both 2 and ( 2k + 1 ) would also be a multiple of ( 2(2k + 1) ). 3. **Finding the Largest Sequence:** By examining several sequences, we recognize that the numbers 7, 8, and 9 are all \\"new,\\" as demonstrated above.

The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by (f(x) = a(x - h)^{2} + k), where ((h, k)) is the vertex of the parabola. Since the graph is symmetric about (x = 1), the (x)-coordinate of the vertex is 1. Thus, we can rewrite the function as (f(x) = (x - 1)^{2} + c), where (c) is a constant. To find the constant (c), we compare the given function (f(x) = x^{2} + (a+2)x + b) with the vertex form. By expanding the vertex form, we get (f(x) = x^{2} - 2x + 1 + c). Matching the coefficients, we find that (a + 2 = -2), which gives (a = -4). The constant term in the given function is (b), and in the vertex form, it is (1 + c). Since the specific values of (b) and (c) do not affect the symmetry or the position of the vertex, we focus on the minimum value of the function, which occurs at the vertex. The minimum value of (f(x)) is the (y)-coordinate of the vertex, which is (c + 1). Without the need to determine (c) explicitly, we know the structure of the function ensures that the minimum value is achieved at (x = 1). Therefore, the minimum value of the function (f(x)) is (f(1) = 1^{2} - 2 cdot 1 + 1 + c = c). Since the exact value of (c) is not determined from the given information, and the solution process is skipped, we acknowledge that the minimum value is directly related to the constant (c), which is determined by the specific values of (a) and (b) that ensure the symmetry about (x = 1). Thus, without loss of generality, the minimum value of the function (f(x)) can be represented as (c), acknowledging the skipped steps in deriving the explicit form of (c). Therefore, the minimum value of the function (f(x)) is boxed{c}."},{"prompt":"The Razorback shop makes a certain amount off each tshirt and 99 off each jersey.

The equation of the tangent at the point ( A(z_1, a z_1^2) ) is: [ u - a z_1^2 = 2a z_1 (z - z_1) ] Since this line passes through ( (z_0, u_0) ): [ u_0 - a z_1^2 = 2a z_1 (z_0 - z_1) ] Simplifying, we get: [ u_0 = 2a z_1 z_0 - a z_1^2 ] 4.

Consider any set of ( N ) points, none of which are collinear. 3. **Setup of the Problem's Instances**: Define the family ( alpha ) to be the collection of all 4-element subsets of the ( N )-element set of points whose convex hull is a quadrilateral. According to Ramsey's theorem, there exists a 100-element subset such that either: - All 4-element subsets of this subset have their convex hull as a quadrilateral. - Or, from prior reasoning, we're particularly interested where for subsets, their convex hulls can't all be triangles. Therefore, if we focus on 4-element subsets, quadrilateral convex hulls should exist according to our needs from Ramsey's theorem. 4. **Reasoning through the Ramsey Setup for Specifics**: Use the result of problem 22.2 which states that it’s impossible for any 5-element subset where all its 4-element subsets have triangular convex hulls. Hence, there should be quadrilateral hull elements leading us to validate the convex structure for our points. 5. **Extrapolating via Convex Hull Properties**: Using the previous step conclusions, instead, by this nature, consider if such points gather and use convex hull properties (a convex hull with nontriangular geometric structures and generalized combinatorial properties defined by Hall's marriage theorem or simpler pigeonhole principles).

First, we convert the speed from km per hour to km per minute: 54 kmph = 54 km / 60 minutes = 0.9 km per minute Now, we calculate the time to cover 14 km at this speed: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 14 km / 0.9 km per minute Time ≈ 15.56 minutes Therefore, the train stops for approximately boxed{15.56} minutes per hour."},{"prompt":"ene and Laura play the following game where they take turns.

Since each power of 9 that has 9 as its leftmost digit represents a step from one power of 10 to the next (starting just above one power of 10 and ending just before the next), the number of such steps is the same as the number of additional digits from 9^1 to 9^{4000}, minus 1 for the initial step from 9^0 to 9^1 that does not count because 9^0=1 does not have 9 as its leftmost digit.

Connect OB, OC, OD, and extend OD to intersect BC at E. 2. **Identifying Angles:** - Since angle DBO and angle BOD both subtend the arc widehat{BD}: [ angle DBO = frac{1}{2} angle BOD = 45^circ ] - Similarly, angle DBO is the central angle subtending arc widehat{BD}: [ angle BOD = 2 times 45^circ = 90^circ ] 3. **Finding angle DBC:** - Since AD:CD = 2:1, and given angle ADB = 60^circ: [ angle DBC = angle ADB - angle ACB = 60^circ - 45^circ = 15^circ ] 4. **Determine angle DBOC:** - Since triangle BOC is isosceles (as OB = OC, being radii of the circle): [ angle BOC = 2 times angle DBC = 2 times 15^circ = 30^circ ] - Therefore: [ angle BOC = 180^circ - 30^circ = 150^circ ] 5. **Determine angle OBC and angle OCB:** - Since the total sum of angles in triangle BOC is 180^circ: [ angle OBC = angle OCB = frac{180^circ - angle BOC}{2} = frac{180^circ - 120^circ}{2} = 30^circ ] 6. **Prove Relationship between OE and BC:** - In triangle OEC, angle EOC = 30^circ and angle EBC = 30^circ hence: [ OE = EC ] - Similarly, angle BOE = 90^circ and angle EBO = 30^circ thus: [ BE = 2 times EO = 2 times EC ] 7. **Ratio Calculation:** - Thus, the ratio comparisons are: [ frac{CE}{EB} = frac{1}{2} = frac{CD}{DA} ] - Hence, AB parallel DO and: [ AB perp OB ] 8. **Conclusion:** Since AB is perpendicular to the radius OB at the point of tangency, AB is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle BCD.

Because of the symmetry and reflection, the following conditions hold: - F_{2}^{prime} T_{2} parallel F_{1} T_{1}, - F_{1} T_{1} = F_{2} T_{2} = F_{2}^{prime} T_{2}, and F_{1} F_{2}^{prime} parallel T_{1} T_{2}. - Therefore, T_{1}T_{2} and T_{1}'T_{2}' are midlines (midsegments) of the parallelogram F_1E_2F_2E_1. 6. **Angle Calculation:** - The given 1:3 angle condition implies that the angle F_{1} E_{2} F_{2} is 180^circ - 4alpha. - Because the tangent bisects the angle between the radial vectors, the angle F_{2}^{prime} E_{2} T_{2} equals F_{1} E_{2} T_{2}^{prime} = T_{2} E_{2} F_{2} = 2alpha. - Similarly, T_{2} O X = 2alpha. 7. **Tangent and Bisecting Angles:** - Corresponding angles T_{2} O B = E_{2} F_{1} B = alpha, making B O X = 2alpha - alpha = alpha, indicating that OB bisects the angle T_{2} O X. 8. **Construction Procedure:** - Locate midpoint O of the tangent midline between e_1 and e_2. - Draw the circle centered at O with radius a. - Find points T_1, T_1', T_2, and T_2' as intersections of the circle with e_1 and e_2. - Establish X so that T_{2} O X is an acute angle. - The bisection of this acute angle T_{2} O X by OX defines the direction for the major axis. 9. **Points and Parallelogram Completion:** - Points A, B on the major axis, as well as foci F_1, F_2, and the tangents E_1, E_2, C, D can be constructed directly. 10. **Feasibility Condition:** - Ensure touching property: 2a > d, where d is the distance between parallel lines e_1 and e_2. 11. **Alternative Configurations:** - If points T_1', T_2' are used, it naturally follows that another ellipse can be drawn which is the reflection of the initial ellipse concerning line O. # Conclusion: Hence, constructing the ellipse involves using the central properties and symmetrical attributes, maintaining the given conditions.

According to the problem, both Rajan and Balan save 1000 each at the end of the year. This means that their incomes minus their expenditures equal their savings: For Rajan: Income - Expenditure = Savings 7x - 6y = 1000 ...(1) For Balan: Income - Expenditure = Savings 6x - 5y = 1000 ...(2) We have two equations with two variables (x and y). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

Each line (L_n) of the form (x + y = n) (where (n ge 2)) can be called a \\"carrier\\" line. The condition (k + a_k neq ell + a_ell) implies that each carrier line has at most one point from the sequence. 5. **Finite Free Carriers:** - For any (m), the number of free carriers among the lines (L_n) with (2 le n le 2015 + m + 1) is at most 2015. - Thus, there exists an (N) such that all carriers (L_n) with (n ge N + 2) are occupied. 6. **Pattern and Weight:** - Define the \\"trace\\" of a point ((i, a_i)) as the set of points on the same carrier line but with (x > i). - Define the \\"pattern\\" (P_x) as the set of (y)-coordinates of the trace points. - The \\"volume\\" of a pattern is the number of elements in (P_x), and the \\"weight\\" is the sum of these elements. 7. **Volume and Weight Dynamics:** - The volume of (P_j) remains constant as (j) increases. - Let (v) be this constant volume. - The weight (w_j) changes by (a_j - (v + 1)) as (j) increases. 8. **Bounding the Sum:** - For (n > m ge N), the sum of deviations can be written as: [ sum_{j=m+1}^n (a_j - (v + 1)) = w_{n+1} - w_{m+1} ] - The weight ranges from (sum_{i=1}^v i) to (sum_{i=1}^v (2015 - v + i)), giving a swing of: [ sum_{i=1}^v (2015 - v + i) - sum_{i=1}^v i = v cdot (2015 - v) ] - The maximum swing is ((2015 - v) cdot v), which is maximized when (v = 1007), giving: [ 1007 cdot 1008 le 1007^2 ] Thus, we have shown that there exist integers (b = v + 1) and (N) such that the sum of deviations is bounded by (1007^2).

By definition, a tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. 4. Now, divide the semicircle ( BAD ) into smaller sections by continued bisection (i.e., keep splitting each arc in half) until reaching a segment ( HD ) of the semicircle ( BAD ) that is smaller than ( AD ). 5. From point ( H ) on the larger circle, drop a perpendicular ( HK ) to the diameter ( BD ) and extend it to point ( F ). 6. Notice that ( HF ) is parallel to ( AC ), because both are perpendicular to ( BD ). Since ( AC ) is a tangent to the smaller circle and does not intersect it (hence it does not touch the smaller circle), ( HF ) will also not intersect the smaller circle. 7.

By the Law of Sines, frac{a}{sinA} = frac{b}{sinB} = frac{c}{sinC}, and by the Law of Cosines, cosA = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}, cosB = frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac}. 2. Substituting these into our given equation, we get frac{sinAcosB+sinBcosA}{sinC}=frac{sqrt{3}cosC}{sinC}. 3. Simplifying further, we use the identity sin(A+B) = sinAcosB + sinBcosA, which gives us frac{sin(A+B)}{sinC}=frac{sqrt{3}cosC}{sinC}. 4. Since A + B + C = pi, sin(A+B) = sin(pi - C) = sinC. Thus, we have frac{sinC}{sinC}=frac{sqrt{3}cosC}{sinC}, leading to tanC=sqrt{3}. 5. Given that C is in the interval (0, pi), the only solution for tanC=sqrt{3} is C=frac{pi}{3}. Therefore, we have C=boxed{frac{pi}{3}}. # Part (2): Finding OC 1. With C=frac{pi}{3}, the sum of angles ∠OAB and ∠OBA is frac{1}{2}(A+B)=frac{1}{2}(pi-C)=frac{1}{2}(pi-frac{pi}{3})=frac{pi}{3}. 2. Therefore, ∠AOB=pi-frac{pi}{3}=frac{2pi}{3}. 3. Given the area of triangle OAB is frac{15sqrt{3}}{4}, we use the formula for the area of a triangle: frac{1}{2}AO times OB times sinfrac{2pi}{3}=frac{15sqrt{3}}{4}. Since sinfrac{2pi}{3}=sqrt{3}/2, we find that AO times OB = 15. 4. Using the Law of Cosines for triangle OAB with AB=7, we get AO^2 + OB^2 + 2(AO)(OB)cosfrac{2pi}{3} = 49. Since cosfrac{2pi}{3}=-1/2, this simplifies to AO^2 + OB^2 - AO times OB = 49. 5. Substituting AO times OB = 15 into the equation, we find (AO + OB)^2 - AO times OB = 49, leading to AO + OB = 8. 6. Solving the system left{begin{array}{l}AO+OB=8, AO times OB=15,end{array}right. gives us two possible solutions: left{begin{array}{l}AO=3, OB=5,end{array}right. or left{begin{array}{l}AO=5, OB=3.end{array}right. 7. Without loss of generality, we choose left{begin{array}{l}AO=3, OB=5.end{array}right. 8. In triangle OAB, using the cosine rule, we find cos∠OAB=frac{3^2 + 7^2 - 5^2}{2 times 3 times 7}=frac{11}{14}, and thus sin∠OAB=sqrt{1-(frac{11}{14})^2}=frac{5sqrt{3}}{14}. 9. Since OA is the angle bisector of angle A, sin∠OAC=frac{5sqrt{3}}{14}. 10. In triangle OAC, applying the Law of Sines, frac{OA}{sin∠ACO}=frac{OC}{sin∠OAC}, we find frac{3}{sinfrac{pi}{6}}=frac{OC}{frac{5sqrt{3}}{14}}. 11. Solving for OC, we get OC=frac{15sqrt{3}}{7}.

We know that the side lengths of these 7 rectangles (one of which is twice as long as the other) must fit exactly within the side length of the original square. Therefore, structural-wise this has to satisfy the basic integer tile fitting logic for a square. 7. This means that splitting a square into 7 rectangles (x times 2x) would lead to geometric constraints: - We should check if there's a consistent arrangement that allows us to use the tiles without overlapping and still fill the square completely. 8. To reason further, we observe traditional tiling where standard mathematical tiling patterns would imply fitting proportions and sides. 9. Given prior numerical approaches and tiling research, it's implicit: - The integer-sided simple tiling does not easily or often split evenly into repeated specific rectangular tile sets that would maintain (2:1) proportion and total an odd number like 7 seamlessly inside a square. 10.

Therefore, a truthful person can only have liars as neighbors. - If a person is a liar, their statement that both neighbors are liars is false, implying that they must have at least one truthful neighbor. 3. **Inferences from Observations**: - If we assume that three consecutive people can be liars, this would lead to a contradiction, because one of them would claim a truth (saying the others are liars). Hence, no three liars can stand consecutively. - Therefore, between any two truthful persons, there must be at most two liars. 4. **Calculations**: - Let's denote the number of truthful people as ( T ) and liars as ( L ). - Given there are 17 people in total: ( T + L = 17 ). - Between any two truthful persons, there can be at most two liars: - If ( T = 5 ) or fewer, the total possible liars ( L ) becomes: [ 2(T - 1) + 1 = 2 times 4 + 1 = 9 ] which does not sum up to 17. - Therefore, the number of truthful persons must be greater than or equal to 6: begin{align*} &T geq 6 &L leq 17 - T end{align*} 5. **Ensuring the Maximum Number of Liars**: - Let's consider ( T = 6 ): [ L = 17 - 6 = 11. ] - We can place the 6 truthful persons in such a way that no three liars are consecutive: [ underbrace{L-T}_{text{2 liars between each }} (text{17 positions}) = 1 + 6times 2 = 11. ] Thus, it does satisfy the condition that the maximum number of liars is 11. # Conclusion: The maximum number of liars that can be arranged in a circle of 17 people with the given conditions is: [ boxed{11} ]"},{"prompt":"Suppose there are 100 guests in a hall, and each guest knows at least 66 of the other 99 guests.

Check Removal Positions 1. **First Digit (a):** Removing the first digit changes the alternating sum by removing a: [ -(b - c + d - e) ] The change in the alternating sum cannot guarantee a result that consistency with pmod{11} for all numbers. 2. **Second Digit (b):** Removing the second digit changes: [ a - c + d - e ] Summing the above equations: [ (a - b + c - d + e) + (a - c + d - e) = 2a - b neq 0 ] Therefore, this is not always divisible by 11. 3. **Middle Digits (e.g., c):** Removing the third digit (c) changes the alternating sum by removing c: [ a - b - d + e ] Since ( S_1 = a + c + e - b - d ) and ( S_2 = a - c + d - e ), we notice: [ S_1 + S_2 = 2a - 2c + e - b - d = 0 Rightarrow a - c neq 0 ]. 4. **Fourth Digit (d):** Similar to (b), we get: [ a - b + c - e ] Sum evaluated to 2a-c-b. 5. **Fifth Digit (e):** Simplified equation similar as other steps. **Conclusion:** Following thorough analysis: - Digit 0 couldn't be the first digit.

If the sides of u_1, u_2, and u_3 are 4x, 5x, and 6x respectively (since sqrt{16} = 4, sqrt{25} = 5, and sqrt{36} = 6), then the side lengths of triangle DEF are determined by the sum of corresponding smaller triangle sides: - The total length corresponding to u_1 and u_2 is 4x + 5x = 9x. - The total length corresponding to u_2 and u_3 is 5x + 6x = 11x. - The total length corresponding to u_3 and u_1 is 6x + 4x = 10x.

Prove that the sum of all chosen vectors is equal to overrightarrow{0} . Solution: 1. **Choosing an Arbitrary Point**: Let us take an arbitrary point O as a reference. 2. **Expressing Vectors**: Express each chosen vector overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{j}} in terms of O. Specifically, we can write: [ overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{j}} = overrightarrow{O A_{j}} - overrightarrow{O A_{i}} ] 3. **Sum of All Vectors**: Let us consider the sum of all such vectors: [ sum_{(A_i, A_j)} overrightarrow{A_i A_j} ] 4. **Substituting Expressions**: Substitute the expression of each vector in terms of O inside the sum: [ sum_{(A_i, A_j)} overrightarrow{A_i A_j} = sum_{(A_i, A_j)} (overrightarrow{O A_j} - overrightarrow{O A_i}) ] 5. **Distributing the Sum**: Distribute the summation over the differences: [ sum_{(A_i, A_j)} (overrightarrow{O A_j} - overrightarrow{O A_i}) = sum_{(A_i, A_j)} overrightarrow{O A_j} - sum_{(A_i, A_j)} overrightarrow{O A_i} ] 6. **Balanced Term Count**: According to the problem's condition, the number of times a vector overrightarrow{O A_i} appears as overrightarrow{O A_i} (i.e., in sum_{(A_i, A_j)} -overrightarrow{O A_i}) balances with the number of times it appears as overrightarrow{O A_j} (i.e., in sum_{(A_i, A_j)} overrightarrow{O A_j}). This means every term overrightarrow{O A_i} appears the same number of times positively and negatively. 7. **Result**: Thus, each vector due to equal counts of positive and negative occurrences will cancel out: [ sum_{(A_i, A_j)} overrightarrow{O A_j} - sum_{(A_i, A_j)} overrightarrow{O A_i} = overrightarrow{0} ] # Conclusion: The sum of all chosen vectors overrightarrow{A B} for some pairs (A, B) of the points, given that the number of vectors starting at each point equals the number of vectors ending at that point, is: [ boxed{overrightarrow{0}} ]"},{"prompt":"The function y= sqrt {1x^{2}}+ frac {9}{1+|x|} is ( ) A: Odd function B: Even function C: Both odd and even function D: Neither odd nor even functio","completion":"From the form of the function, we get begin{cases} overset{1-x^{2}geqslant 0}{1+|x|neq 0}end{cases}.

Then, by Vieta's formula: [ r_1 + r_2 = -a, ] [ r_1 r_2 = b - 3. ] 3. **Using Interval Boundaries**: Since (r_1) and (r_2) are within ([1, 2]), it implies: [ 2 leq r_1 + r_2 leq 4 implies 2 leq -a leq 4 implies -4 leq a leq -2. ] Thus, (a in [-4, -2]). 4. **Considering ((a + b - 2)(2a + b + 1) leq 0)**: This ensures the equation has real roots in the interval by the intersection of conditions for roots to lie in ([1, 2]). 5. **Simplifying Conditions for (b)**: - From (a + b - 2 geq 0), we get (b geq 2 - a). - From (2a + b + 1 geq 0), we get (b geq -2a - 1). 6. **Analyzing Intersection**: Hence for the intersection of ranges: [ b geq max(2 - a , -2a - 1). ] 7. **Calculation of Minimum Distance**: - We need to minimize (a^2 + (b - 4)^2). - This represents the Euclidean distance from point ((a, b)) to point ((0, 4)). - The minimum distance from any point on the line to ( (0,4) ) using distance formula ( d = frac{|Ax + By + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} ), simplifies for ( a, b ) in the interval. 8. **Critical Points Check**: - Translate the condition visually or graphically to check the shortest distance from ( (a, b) ) points in feasible region to ( (0,4) ). Point with minimum algebraic form of distance condition must satisfy (d= frac{|(2a -1) -2 -2a -1|}{ sqrt{2}}). - Solving simplest case for minimum using all intersections and critical valuing ( d = sqrt{2} ). Therefore, the minimal value of (a^2 + (b-4)^2) achievable when ((a, b) = (-1, 3)), yields: Conclusion: [ boxed{2} ]"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},N={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],I={key:0},W={key:1};function L(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(i(!0),a(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(i(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",N,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
