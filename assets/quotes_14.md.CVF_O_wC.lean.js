This is a statement of Schur's theorem. 2. **Introduction to Ramsey Numbers:** Consider the Ramsey number for (n) colors, denoted (R_{n}(3, 3, ldots, 3)), abbreviated as (R). By definition, (R) is the smallest number such that any (n)-coloring of the edges of a complete graph (K_R) (a graph with (R) vertices where each pair of vertices is connected by an edge) will contain a monochromatic triangle. 3. **Setup of the Graph (K_R):** Consider the complete graph (K_R) where: - The vertices are numbered (0, 1, 2, ldots, R-1). - The edges between these vertices are colored using (n) colors, denoted (C_1, C_2, ldots, C_n). 4. **Edge Coloring Rule:** Color each edge ((i, j)) with the color (C_k) determined by the condition that (|i - j| in P_k). Specifically, for vertices (i < j), the color of edge ((i, j)) is (C_k) if (|i - j| in P_k). 5. **Application of Ramsey's Theorem:** By the definition of (R) as a Ramsey number, the complete graph (K_R) must contain at least one monochromatic triangle. Without loss of generality, assume this monochromatic triangle is colored with color (C_1). Let the vertices of this triangle be (i < j < k). 6. **Monochromatic Triangle Implication:** Since the triangle with vertices (i, j, k) is monochromatic in color (C_1): - The edges ((i, j)), ((j, k)), and ((i, k)) are all colored with (C_1). - Using our edge coloring rule, this implies (|i - j| in P_1), (|j - k| in P_1), and (|i - k| in P_1). 7. **Conclusion with Set Membership:** Let (x = |j - i|), (y = |k - j|), and (z = |k - i|). So: - (x in P_1) since (|j - i| in P_1). - (y in P_1) since (|k - j| in P_1). - (z in P_1) since (|k - i| in P_1). - Additionally, (x + y = z), and since all quantities are in (P_1), it follows that (x + y = z in P_1). # Conclusion: Thus, there exists a subset (P_1) and elements (x, y in P_1) such that (x + y in P_1), proving Schur’s theorem as required.

[ 3^s - 1 quad text{cannot be a power of 2 for } s > 2 ] If ( s ) is odd, ( 3^s - 1 ) is greater than 8 and not divisible by 8, as its remainder when divided by 8 is 2. If ( s = 2k ), ( 3^s - 1 ) is divisible by ( 3^k + 1 ), which is not a power of 2. Hence, ( 9^s - 1 ) is a power of 2 only when ( s = 1 ). Next, we consider the remainders of the powers of 9 modulo 11: ( 9, 4, 3, 5, 1 ), and they repeat cyclically. Since ( x ) is divisible by 11, ( n ) must be a multiple of 5. Thus, ( x = 9^{5m} - 1 ). Let ( m = 1 ): 5. [ x = 9^5 - 1 = 59048 = 2^3 cdot 11^2 cdot 61 ] This ( x ) fits the condition given in the problem. To prove that ( m > 1 ) gives no other solutions, consider the following cases: 6. Case 1: ( m ) is odd. By the formula for the sum of a geometric series: [ x = p cdot q, quad text{where} quad p = 9^m - 1 quad text{and} quad q = 1 + 9^m + 9^{2m} + 9^{3m} + 9^{4m} ] We need to prove that ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime. Suppose ( r ) divides both ( p ) and ( q ): [ 1 + 9^m + 9^{2m} + 9^{3m} + 9^{4m} - left( 9^m - 1 right) - left( 9^{2m} - 1 right) - left( 9^{3m} - 1 right) - left( 9^{4m} - 1 right) = 5 ] Since ( 9^{km} - 1 ) is divisible by ( p ) and ( r ), ( r ) must divide 5. But ( p ) is not divisible by 5 when ( m ) is odd, hence ( r = 1 ). If ( p ) is divisible by 11, ( m ) should be a multiple of 5 meaning ( m = 5k ). For ( k > 1 ), consider the prime factorizations, showing at least three distinct odd prime divisors. 7. Case 2: ( m ) is even. Let ( n = 2k ) for ( k geq 5 ): [ x = (9^k - 1)(9^k + 1) = (3^k - 1)(3^k + 1)(9^k + 1) ] The factors on the right-hand side are coprime and none of them is a power of 2. Hence, ( x ) has at least three distinct odd prime divisors, which is impossible for the conditions given in the problem. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the only suitable ( x ) that fits all conditions given in the problem is: [ boxed{59048} ]"},{"prompt":"John weighs 220 pounds when he starts exercising.

To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds. So, the train's speed in m/s is: 25 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = (25 * 1000) / 3600 m/s = 25000 / 3600 m/s ≈ 6.944 m/s Now, we know that the train takes 52 seconds to cross the man.

However, for f(x) to have local min and max at x=x_{1} and x=x_{2} with x_{1} < x_{2}, the condition contradicts the behavior of f'(x) and f''(x) for a > 1. 4. **Analysis of f''(x) for 0 < a < 1**: - For 0 < a < 1, f''(x) is monotonically increasing and then decreasing on mathbb{R}. - If there exists x_{0} such that f''(x_{0}) = 0, then f'(x) is monotonically increasing on (-infty, x_{0}) and monotonically decreasing on (x_{0}, +infty), with x_{0} = log_{a}left(frac{e}{(ln a)^{2}}right). 5. **Condition for Local Min and Max**: - For f(x) to have local minimum and maximum points at x=x_{1} and x=x_{2} respectively, with x_{1} < x_{2}, it is necessary that f'(x_{0}) > 0. This leads to the inequality: [frac{e}{ln a} > log_{a}left(frac{e}{(ln a)^{2}}right) Rightarrow a^{frac{1}{ln a}} < frac{e}{(ln a)^{2}}.] - Simplifying the inequality, we get: [ln a^{frac{1}{ln a}} < lnleft(frac{e}{(ln a)^{2}}right) Rightarrow frac{1}{ln a}ln a < 1-ln(ln a)^{2}.] 6. **Solving the Inequality**: - Solving the above inequality gives the range of values for a as dfrac{1}{e} < a < e.

If both the numerator and denominator are reduced by 19, the resulting fraction simplifies to (frac{1}{5}). We need to find the original fraction. 1. Let the numerator be ( x ) and the denominator be ( y ). We know that: [ x + y = 122 ] 2. After reducing the numerator and denominator by 19, the fraction becomes: [ frac{x-19}{y-19} = frac{1}{5} ] 3. Cross-multiplying to clear the fraction, we have: [ 5(x - 19) = y - 19 ] 4. Expanding and simplifying this equation: [ 5x - 95 = y - 19 ] 5. Rearrange it to solve for ( y ): [ 5x - y = 76 ] 6.

We have 3 minutes and 15 seconds, which is 3 minutes plus 15 seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 15 seconds is 15/60 minutes, which is 0.25 minutes. So the total time in minutes is 3 + 0.25 = 3.25 minutes. The subway is moving at a speed of 1.6 kilometers per minute. To find out how far the subway traveled in 3.25 minutes, we multiply the speed by the time: Distance traveled = Speed × Time Distance traveled = 1.6 km/min × 3.25 min Distance traveled = 5.2 km Since the distance between the previous station and this station is 4.85 km, and the subway traveled 5.2 km in the time it took to pass the station completely, the difference between these two distances is the length of the subway. Length of the subway = Distance traveled - Distance between stations Length of the subway = 5.2 km - 4.85 km Length of the subway = 0.35 km To convert the length of the subway from kilometers to meters, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 km = 1000 m): Length of the subway in meters = 0.35 km × 1000 m/km Length of the subway in meters = 350 m Therefore, the subway is boxed{350} meters long."},{"prompt":"John drinks 2 energy drinks. 1 of them is a 12ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.

Consider the plane section of the pyramid through the vertex P and midpoints K and L of sides AB and CD respectively. This section forms an isosceles triangle PKL with KL = a and height PM = a. 2. We focus on finding the radius r of the circle inscribed in the isosceles triangle PKL. Let's explore several methods to solve this problem: First Method: 2. Using the right-angled triangle PKM, we compute the tangent of the angle beta: [ tan beta = tan angle PKM = frac{PM}{MK} = frac{a}{frac{a}{2}} = 2 ] 3. Since KO is the angle bisector in triangle PKM, we can use the tangent half-angle formula: [ tan left(frac{beta}{2}right) = t ] Solving the equation [ 2 = frac{2t}{1-t^2} ] we get [ t = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} ] 4. Using the relationship for the radius r in terms of a and t: [ r = frac{a}{2} cdot tan left( frac{beta}{2} right) = frac{a(sqrt{5} - 1)}{4} ] Second Method: 5. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle PKM, we find the hypotenuse PK: [ PK = sqrt{MK^2 + PM^2} = sqrt{left( frac{a}{2} right)^2 + a^2} = frac{a sqrt{5}}{2} ] 6. Using the property of angle bisectors in triangles: [ frac{KP}{KM} = sqrt{5}, quad text {or } frac{a - r}{r} = sqrt{5} ] Solving for r, we get: [ r = frac{a}{sqrt{5} + 1} cdot (sqrt{5} - 1) = frac{a(sqrt{5} - 1)}{4} ] Third Method: 7. Let Q be the point of tangency of the inscribed circle with PK, then: [ KQ = MK = frac{a}{2}, quad text{and } PQ = PK - KQ = frac{a sqrt{5}}{2} - frac{a}{2} = frac{a (sqrt{5} - 1)}{2} ] 8. By similar right triangles PQO and RKM, we have: [ frac{PQ}{r} = frac{PM}{MK} = 2, quad text{or } r = frac{a(sqrt{5} - 1)}{4} ] Fourth Method: 9. Let p be the semiperimeter of triangle PKL and S be its area, then: [ p = frac{PK + KL + PL}{2} = frac{a sqrt{5}}{2} + frac{a}{2} = frac{a(1 + sqrt{5})}{2} ] Using the area formula for the triangle: [ S = frac{1}{2} KL cdot PM = frac{1}{2} a cdot a = frac{a^2}{2} ] 10. The radius r can then be computed using: [ r = frac{S}{p} = frac{a^2}{2} cdot Big/ frac{a(1 + sqrt{5})}{2} = frac{a(sqrt{5} - 1)}{4} ] **Conclusion:** All methods confirm that the radius r of the inscribed sphere in the regular quadrilateral pyramid is: [ boxed{frac{a (sqrt{5} - 1)}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let Delta ABC be a triangle with an inscribed circle centered at I .

First, note that each face of the cube can be thought of as a plane that extends infinitely in all directions. However, for our purposes, we're only interested in the portion of the space that is relevant to the cube. 2. The cube has 6 faces, and each face's plane will divide space into two parts - the space on one side of the plane and the space on the other. 3. Now, let's think about how these planes intersect. Initially, we have the space outside the cube which is one part. As we add the first plane (or the first face of the cube), it divides the space into two parts. 4. As we add the second plane, there are a few possibilities. If it is parallel to the first, it wouldn't intersect with the first, and we would just have two more parts (one on either side of the new plane). However, the planes on a cube are perpendicular to each other. So, when the second plane corresponds to the second face of the cube, it will intersect the first plane along a line and divide each of the existing parts into two, resulting in four parts so far. 5. As we continue this process with the third plane (the third face of the cube that is perpendicular to the other two), the situation becomes three-dimensional. The third plane would intersect the first two planes along two lines, creating intersections in space and further dividing each part into two. This gives us a total of 8 parts before considering the interior of the cube. 6. Thus far, we've only considered the outer space of the cube. However, there is one part of the space that is inside the cube, which we must add to our count. 7. Additionally, each face of the cube not only divides external space but also intersects with the other faces to partition the interior of the cube. Each edge of the cube creates a new section within the cube, and each corner where three faces meet creates even smaller sections. 8. To conclude, we need to add all the sections created by these intersections, both external and internal to the cube: - 1 part inside the cube. - 6 parts directly outside each face of the cube. - 12 parts around the edges of the cube (each edge has one part outside the cube that isn't directly adjacent to any face). - 8 parts around the vertices of the cube (each corner has one part that is outside all of the faces and edges). Adding them up yields 1 (inner) + 6 (faces) + 12 (edges) + 8 (vertices) = 27 parts in total.

Given the regularity of polygon B_{1} B_{2} ldots B_{n}, each side A_{i-1}A_{i} of the original polygon A_{1}A_{2}ldots A_{n} must intersect the extensions of O B_{i-1} and O B_{i}. 8. Since each angle formed between O A_{i} and O A_{i+1} is frac{360^circ}{n} and each segment O B_{i} is equal, it follows that the ratio of lengths is consistent: [ frac{O A_{1}}{O A_{2}} = frac{O A_{2}}{O A_{3}} = ldots = frac{O A_{n}}{O A_{1}} = k ] 9. This implies that: [ O A_{2} = k O A_{1} ] [ O A_{3} = k O A_{2} = k^2 O A_{1} ] Continuing in this manner, we get: [ O A_{n} = k^{n-1} O A_{1} ] 10. For the polygon to close (i.e., O A_{n} = O A_{1}), we must have: [ k^{n} O A_{1} = O A_{1} ] Therefore: [ k^n = 1 ] 11. The only real solution is k = 1, meaning O A_{i} are all equal for all i. So, polygon A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{n} must be a regular polygon. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Polygon } A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{n} text{ is a regular polygon.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a function f(x) = frac{1}{3}x^{3} + ax + b (a, b in mathbb{R}), it has a minimum value of frac{4}{3} at x = 2.

Firstly, we find the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = x^2 + a Since f(x) has a local minimum at x = 2, the derivative at this point must be zero: f'(2) = 2^2 + a = 0 Solving for a, we get: a = -4 Next, using the fact that f(2) = -frac{4}{3}, we substitute x = 2 and a = -4 into the original function to find b: f(2) = frac{1}{3}(2)^3 - 4(2) + b = -frac{4}{3} From this equation, we find that b = 4. Therefore, the function f(x) is: f(x) = frac{1}{3}x^{3} - 4x + 4 (2) To find the range of m such that the inequality holds for all x in [-4, 3], we need to find the maximum value of f(x) on that interval.

Each coin has two possible outcomes (heads or tails), and since the flips are independent, the total number of outcomes is calculated by multiplying the number of outcomes for each coin. This gives us: [2 times 2 times 2 times 2 = 2^4 = 16] Next, we need to calculate the number of outcomes that result in at least 15 cents worth of coins coming up heads. We can break this down into two cases: 1. **The quarter comes up heads**: Since the quarter alone is worth 25 cents, any outcome where the quarter is heads will satisfy the condition of having at least 15 cents worth of coins coming up heads. With the quarter fixed as heads, the other three coins (penny, nickel, and dime) can each come up either heads or tails, giving us: [2 times 2 times 2 = 2^3 = 8] possible outcomes. 2. **The quarter comes up tails**: In this case, to have at least 15 cents in heads, both the nickel and the dime must come up heads (since together they are worth 15 cents), leaving the penny as the only variable coin. The penny can come up either heads or tails, giving us: [2] possible outcomes. Adding the outcomes from both cases gives us the total number of successful outcomes: [8 + 2 = 10] Finally, the probability of getting at least 15 cents worth of coins coming up heads is the ratio of the number of successful outcomes to the total number of outcomes: [dfrac{10}{16} = dfrac{5}{8}] Therefore, the probability that at least 15 cents worth of coins come up heads is boxed{dfrac{5}{8}}."},{"prompt":"John bought a shirt on sale for 25% off the original price and another 25% off the discounted price.

Each edge in the graph connects two vertices. Therefore, each edge is counted twice when we consider it from the perspective of each of its two endpoints. Let ( E ) be the set of edges in the graph. The total number of these pairs is: [ 2 times |E| ] Since ( 2 times |E| ) is clearly an even number (as it is a multiple of 2), we can conclude that this total count is even. 2. **Calculate the sum of degrees of all vertices:** Next, we represent the sum of the degrees of all vertices. The degree of a vertex is defined as the number of edges incident to it. Let ( V ) be the set of vertices in the graph, and let ( deg(v) ) denote the degree of a vertex ( v ). The sum of the degrees of all vertices is: [ sum_{v in V} deg(v) ] By the Handshaking Lemma (a fundamental result in graph theory), this sum is exactly twice the number of edges: [ sum_{v in V} deg(v) = 2 times |E| ] Thus, (sum_{v in V} deg(v) ) is also even because ( 2 times |E| ) is even. 3. **Relate to the degrees of specific vertices:** Consider the vertices of the graph whose degree is odd. The degree sum calculated in the previous step can be partitioned into contributions from vertices of odd degree and even degree. Let (V_{text{odd}} subseteq V) be the subset of vertices with odd degree and ( V_{text{even}} subseteq V) be the subset of vertices with even degree. The overall degree sum can then be written as: [ sum_{v in V} deg(v) = sum_{v in V_{text{odd}}} deg(v) + sum_{v in V_{text{even}}} deg(v) ] Since the overall sum is even, the sum ( sum_{v in V_{text{even}}} deg(v) ) is also even (as it is a sum of even numbers). 4. **Sum of odd degrees is even:** Consequently, for the even sum ( sum_{v in V} deg(v) ) to be satisfied, the sum of the degrees of vertices in ( V_{text{odd}} ) must be even (since the sum of an even number plus another even number is even). Each vertex in ( V_{text{odd}} ) contributes an odd number to the sum. A sum of odd numbers can only be even if there is an even number of them. This is a basic property of numbers: if you add an even number of odd numbers, the result is even. 5. **Conclusion:** Hence, the number of vertices with an odd degree in any graph must be even.

The length of the train is 100 meters, and the speed of the train is 100 km/hour. First, we need to convert the speed from km/hour to m/second to match the units of the length of the train. Speed in m/s = (Speed in km/hour) × (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 100 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 100,000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 27.78 (rounded to two decimal places) Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the pole using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance to be covered is equal to the length of the train, which is 100 meters.

We multiply both sides of the inequality by 3(a + 1)b to avoid division by zero and to simplify the expression: [ 3(a + 1)bleft(frac{4}{a + 1} + frac{1}{b}right) = 3(4b + (a + 1)) = 12b + 3a + 3 ] Since a + 1 + b = 3, we can rewrite the left-hand side as: [ frac{1}{3}(a + 1 + b)left(frac{4}{a + 1} + frac{1}{b}right) = frac{1}{3}(5 + frac{4b}{a + 1} + frac{a + 1}{b}) ] By the AM-GM inequality, we know that frac{4b}{a + 1} + frac{a + 1}{b} geqslant 2sqrt{frac{4b}{a + 1} cdot frac{a + 1}{b}} = 2sqrt{4} = 4. Therefore, we have: [ frac{1}{3}(5 + frac{4b}{a + 1} + frac{a + 1}{b}) geqslant frac{1}{3}(5 + 4) = 3 ] Hence, frac{4}{a + 1} + frac{1}{b} geqslant 3, with equality holding only when frac{4b}{a + 1} = frac{a + 1}{b}, which happens when a = b = 1. boxed{frac{4}{a + 1} + frac{1}{b} geqslant 3}"},{"prompt":"There are 2,000 kids in camp.

According to the problem, when x=0, y=192, and when x=22, y=48. By substituting these values into the function y = e^{kx+b}, we can solve for k and b. Then, we can substitute x=33 into the function to obtain the preservation time at 33^circC. Step 1: Substitute the given values into the function: When x=0, y=192, we have e^b = 192. When x=22, y=48, we have e^{22k+b} = 48. Step 2: Solve for k and b: From the first equation, we have b = ln 192. Substitute b into the second equation, we have e^{22k +ln 192} = 48, which implies e^{22k} = 48/192 = 1/4. Thus, 22k = ln (1/4), and k = ln (1/4) / 22.

Consider the characteristics of a knight and a liar: - A knight always tells the truth. - A liar always tells lies. 2. Based on the problem, you are a normal person, meaning you are neither a knight (who always tells the truth) nor a liar (who always tells lies). 3. To prove your innocence, you need a statement that neither a knight nor a liar could say. 4. Let’s analyze the statement: \\"I am a liar.\\" - If a knight says, \\"I am a liar,\\" it would be a contradiction because knights always tell the truth. Hence, a knight cannot say this statement. - If a liar says, \\"I am a liar,\\" it would also be a contradiction because liars never tell the truth. Hence, a liar cannot say this statement either. 5. Therefore, the statement \\"I am a liar\\" is something that neither a knight nor a liar can assert. 6. Since the problem states that neither a knight nor a liar can make such a statement, but you, being a normal person, can, it follows that declaring \\"I am a liar\\" will demonstrate that you do not fit into either category of knight or liar. 7.

This means ( n ) is relatively prime to ( m! ). 3. **Sum of Squares Function:** We define a function ( f(n) ) such that: [ f(n) = begin{cases} n^2 & text{if } gcd(n, m!) = 1 0 & text{if } gcd(n, m!) > 1 end{cases} ] Then, (mathcal{S}_k) can be written as: [ mathcal{S}_k = sum_{i=1}^{m!} f(i) ] 4. **Using Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** Let ( x = m! ) and let ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) be the prime factors of ( x ). The sum of the squares of all positive integers ( n leq x ) such that (gcd(n, x) = 1) can be found using the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion (PIE): [ S(x) = sum_{i=1}^x i^2 - sum_{1 leq i leq k} sum_{j=1}^{x/p_i} (jp_i)^2 + sum_{1 leq i leq j leq k} sum_{h=1}^{x/p_ip_j} (hp_ip_j)^2 - cdots ] 5. **Simplifying the Sum:** Define the function: [ g(x) = frac{sum_{i=1}^x i^2}{x^2} ] Using the well-known formula for the sum of squares: [ sum_{i=1}^x i^2 = frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6} ] We get: [ g(x) = frac{x(x+1)(2x+1)}{6x^2} = frac{2x^3 + 3x^2 + x}{6x^2} = frac{1}{3}x + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{6x} ] 6. **Applying Inclusion-Exclusion:** [ frac{S(x)}{x^2} = g(x) - sum_{1 leq i leq k} gleft(frac{x}{p_i}right) + sum_{1 leq i leq j leq k} gleft(frac{x}{p_ip_j}right) - cdots ] Substituting ( g(x) ): [ frac{S(x)}{x^2} = frac{1}{3} left( x - sum_{1 leq i leq k} frac{x}{p_i} + sum_{1 leq i leq j leq k} frac{x}{p_ip_j} - cdots right) + frac{1}{2} left( 1 - k + binom{k}{2} - cdots right) + frac{1}{6} left( frac{1}{x} - sum_{1 leq i leq k} frac{p_i}{x} + sum_{1 leq i leq j leq k} frac{p_ip_j}{x} - cdots right) ] 7. **Simplifying the Terms:** Let the three terms be (alpha, beta, gamma) respectively.

Hence, by induction, it is possible in the city of Zurbagan to introduce one-way traffic on all streets while ensuring that passage from any point to any other remains feasible. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

These segments should be chosen so that when they are joined, they form equilateral triangles. 3. **Set up coordinates for calculation:** Consider one of the front faces of the cube. Let’s label two points on this face as ( M ) and ( N ) and a point on an adjacent face as ( P ). To simplify calculations, we can place the origin ( O ) at one of the vertices of the cube and align the axes along the edges of the cube such that: - ( M ) and ( N ) lie on the front face. - ( P ) lies on the adjacent side face. We assume the length of the edge of the cube to be ( a ). Coordinates are then set as: - ( N left(frac{a}{2}, 0, frac{a - m}{2}right) ) - ( P left(a, frac{a - m}{2}, frac{a}{2}right) ) 4. **Calculate the distance ( |NP| ):** We need the distance between the points ( N ) and ( P ) to be equal to ( m ).

The goal is to determine for which values of (m) and (n) one can remove all the cards from the board by a sequence of allowed moves. 1. **Base Observation**: - We can remove all cards unless both (m) and (n) are even. 2. **Odd Number Case**: Suppose (m) or (n) (or both) are odd and consider a sequence of moves: - If there is a row with an odd number of cards, and initially, all these cards are showing black. - We can remove cards from odd-numbered columns first. Each card in an even-numbered column will be turned over twice, thereby remaining black. - After removing the odd-column cards, we can then remove the even-column cards. 3. **Row by Row Removal**: - If there are an odd number of columns, start by removing cards from the top row, which leaves all cards in the second row black. - Remove cards in the second row, continuing similarly on each subsequent row. - By similar reasoning, if there is an odd number of rows, we can interchange rows and columns and perform the removal in a similar sequence. 4. **General Case for Odd**: - So, if (m) and (n) are not both even, we can remove all the cards using a sequence of the described moves. 5. **Both (m) and (n) Even Case**: - Suppose (m) and (n) are both even. - Start with (N = 0), where (N) tracks the count of cards which share an edge with the cards already removed. 6. **Contribution to (N)**: - The first card removed contributes (0) to (N) since no neighboring card has been removed yet. - Each subsequent card (initially white) must turn black before it is removed. This requires an odd number of neighboring black cards (as flipping occurs when a neighboring card is removed). - Thus, removing a card changes (N) by adding an odd number. 7. **Sum of Odd Numbers**: - If cards are removed, we are adding an odd number of odd numbers to (N), making (N) itself odd by the end of the process. 8. **Edge-Sharing Pairs**: - Calculate the total number of pairs of squares sharing an edge: [ m(n-1) + n(m-1) ] - The term (m(n-1)) counts the pairs along rows. - The term (n(m-1)) counts the pairs along columns. - Since both (m) and (n) are even, (m(n-1) + n(m-1)) results in an even number (as the sum of products involving at least one even factor). 9. **Final Value Contradiction**: - Since each pair contributes once to (N) when the second member of the pair is removed, the final (N) must equal the number of pairs, resulting in an even value. - Contradiction arises because the required final (N) from allowed removals must be odd, while the number of pairs confirms the final (N) should be even. # Conclusion: We conclude that it is possible to remove all the cards from the board by a sequence of moves if and only if not both (m) and (n) are even.

We can rewrite the inequality (lnfrac{x_{1}}{x_{2}} < a(x_{1}-x_{2})) as (ln x_{1} - ln x_{2} < ax_{1} - ax_{2}) by properties of logarithms and distributing (a). 3. Further simplification gives us (ln x_{1} - ax_{1} < ln x_{2} - ax_{2}). This implies that when (x_{1} < x_{2}), (F(x_{1}) < F(x_{2})), where (F(x) = ln x - ax). 4. Now, let's define (F(x) = ln x - ax) for (x in [1,e]). The inequality (F(x_{1}) < F(x_{2})) suggests that (F(x)) is monotonically increasing on the interval ([1,e]). 5.

We need to prove that the shortest path from (A) to (B) requires the bug to travel a distance at least (frac{AB}{2}) in one direction (along the edges of the hexagons). Furthermore, we need to determine the number of edges the bug traverses if it travels exactly (frac{AB}{2}) in one direction. 1. **Coordinate Framework:** Vertices in the hexagonal lattice can be partitioned into two sets (let’s denote them as (circ) and (cdot)). Each set forms a skewed lattice with axes at 60 degrees. 2. **Directional Vectors:** Let's define the three basic directions in the hexagonal grid: - Direction 1: ((1, 0)) - Direction 2: ((1, frac{sqrt{3}}{2})) - Direction 3: ((0, sqrt{3})) 3. **Pathing Constraints:** Any path from ( A ) to ( B ) must alternate between the two lattices ((circ) and (cdot)). Thus, if (B) is on the same lattice as (A), we can coordinate (B) relative to (A) using the coordinates ((m, n)). 4. **Calculating Distances:** The shortest path from a lattice point ((m, n)) in the direction: - From ((m, n)) to the next point east is one edge in direction 3 followed by an edge in direction 2. - From ((m, n)) to the next point northeast is one edge in direction 1, followed by direction 2. For (B), if it is on the same lattice as (A), then the coordinates ((m, n)) correspond to: - Distance east apparent as ( sqrt{3}left(m + frac{n}{2}right) ) - Distance north as ( frac{3n}{2} ) Therefore, (AB = sqrt{3left(m + frac{n}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{3n}{2}right)^2}). 5. **Proof and Calculation:** - We need to show for any ( m ) and ( n ), the path includes (frac{AB}{2}) in at least one direction. The calculation for a lattice point ((m, n)) shows that the total distance is expressed openly: [ AB^2 = 3left(m + n/2right) + left(frac{3n}{2}right)^2 ] [ Rightarrow AB^2 = 3m^2 + 3mn + frac{3n^2}{4} ] Dividing this distance by 2: [ left(frac{AB}{2}right)^2 = frac{3m^2 + 3mn + frac{3n^2}{4}}{4} ] This shows that the manipulation fits the symmetrical properties. By partitioning and directional separation, having (m) and (n) equal (or opposite shift where they are 1 or 0), the bug's travel turns back to equidistant hops, showing (frac{AB}{2}). 6. **Special Case Calculation:** - For (m = 1) and (n = 0) or (n = 1) and (m = 0), which makes the distance exactly 2 units. Thus, if the bug ends up travelling exactly (frac{AB}{2}) in one direction: - The choice of hopping 2 hexagons crossing thus 3 basic traversals. This shows a final count as predicates all consistent statements verifying our assumptions. Therefore, when the bug exactly matches (frac{AB}{2}) travel, vertices count and lattice cut through shows an efficient coverage of three(hexagon movement edges). **Conclusion:** [ boxed{3} ]"},{"prompt":"The smallest integer in the set A={xinmathbb{R} mid |x2|leq5} is ____.","completion":"Given A={xinmathbb{R} mid |x-2|leq5}, from |x-2|leq5, we get -5leq x-2 leq5, thus -3leq x leq7, therefore, the smallest integer in the set A={xinmathbb{R} mid |x-2|leq5} is -3.

Preliminary Observations:** Let's recall the fundamental properties of the hexagonal grid: - The angles in a regular hexagon are (120^circ). - Thus, each node (vertex) connects to 3 other vertices through edges (unit line segments), forming a set of directions corresponding to 0, 4, and 8 o'clock, which we'll denote as type (C_0) nodes. Conversely, the directions opposite to these are 6, 10, and 2 o'clock, and we'll denote these nodes as type (C_6) nodes. - Each node of type (C_0) is connected to neighboring nodes of type (C_6), and vice versa. **2. Task:** Prove that if there is no path shorter than 20 units between points (A) and (B), the bug must have moved in the same direction for at least half of that path. **3. Step-by-Step Proof:** **Step 1: Analyze Path Properties** - Suppose the bug travels a path (U: A ldots C D E F ldots G H J K ldots B). - Within this path, if we find two parallel segments (DE) and (HJ) where the bug travels in opposite directions, then (D) and (J) are the same type and so are (E) and (H). **Step 2: Reflection and Parallel Line Analysis** Consider the quadrilateral (DEHJ): - (D) and (J) are both the same type,(C_0) or (C_6). - The lengths (DE = JH), forming the quadrilateral (DEHJ) as a parallelogram. - Reflect part of the path from (E) to (H) over the axis of symmetry of (DEHJ). This modification results in a new path: [A ldots C D G' ldots F' J K ldots B] where the bug's path is shortened by 2 units due to the reflection. It contradicts the hypothesis that the shortest path is 20 units unless the movements between these segments maintain a consistent direction. **Step 3: Verify Short Long Directions** Assign directional vectors corresponding to 'hour' positions on a clock face: - Directions from nodes can shift in 3 different sets: one set originating from type (C_0) nodes, and the reverse directions for type (C_6) nodes. - For the bug to travel 20 units, it must alternate between types. This ensures that the movement directions must repeat due to node-type alternations (finite vectors are involved). Given that the chosen path is minimal and contains no contradictory pairs of opposite-directed parallel segments, it ensures no other redirection to short path could fit. **Conclusion:** Hence, in traveling from ( A ) to ( B ), which spans an even number of steps due to the node alternation property, at least one-half of the path has been consistently oriented in one direction. Therefore, the visited path ensures the bug moved in the same direction for at least 10 units consistently. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"The sum of the ages of Mrs Bai and her daughter Jenni is a certain number.

To investigate whether Buratino has made an error, we need to examine the adjacency condition on the faces of the cube. Each face is divided into 2 times 2 = 4 smaller squares. 2. **Examining the Given Configuration**: To satisfy the condition stipulated by Malvina, each small square on the cube's faces should be adjacent to two 'X' squares and two 'O' squares along its edges. Let us analyze whether the configuration seen in the given illustration adheres to this rule. 3. **Determine Violation on Lower Face**: By inspecting the provided illustration, let us consider the lower face of the cube, which is not visible in the illustration.

This means that for larger values of x, we get larger values of y. For the inverse variation function y=frac{2}{x}, as x increases, y decreases because y is inversely proportional to x. This means that for larger values of x, we get smaller values of y. Therefore, option A does not describe a common characteristic of both functions. - **Option B: The graph intersects with the coordinate axes.** For the direct variation function y=2x, its graph passes through the origin (0,0), which means it intersects both the x-axis and the y-axis at the origin. For the inverse variation function y=frac{2}{x}, its graph does not intersect the y-axis because there is no value of x that makes y equal to 0.

After taking these jewels, the dragon had ( J - 3 + 6 ) jewels, which equals ( J + 3 ) jewels. We are told that the dragon owned 24 jewels in the end, so we can set up the equation: [ J + 3 = 24 ] Solving for ( J ), we get: [ J = 24 - 3 ] [ J = 21 ] The dragon originally had 21 jewels, and it gained 6 new jewels from the king's crown. The ratio of the number of new jewels to the number of jewels the dragon owned before is: [ frac{text{New Jewels}}{text{Original Jewels}} = frac{6}{21} ] To simplify the ratio, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3: [ frac{6}{21} = frac{6 div 3}{21 div 3} = frac{2}{7} ] So, the ratio of the number of new jewels to the number of jewels the dragon owned before is ( boxed{frac{2}{7}} )."},{"prompt":"Let g:(0,infty) rightarrow (0,infty) be a differentiable function whose derivative is continuous, and such that g(g(x)) = x for all x> 0 .

Given that ( g: (0, infty) rightarrow (0, infty) ) is a differentiable function with a continuous derivative and satisfies ( g(g(x)) = x ) for all ( x > 0 ). We need to prove that ( g ) must be strictly decreasing if it is not the identity function. 2. Differentiate both sides of the equation ( g(g(x)) = x ) with respect to ( x ): [ frac{d}{dx} [g(g(x))] = frac{d}{dx} [x] ] Using the chain rule on the left-hand side, we get: [ g'(g(x)) cdot g'(x) = 1 ] This holds for all ( x > 0 ). 3. Since ( g'(g(x)) cdot g'(x) = 1 ), it follows that ( g'(x) neq 0 ) for any ( x > 0 ). If ( g'(x) = 0 ) for some ( x ), then the equation would imply ( 0 = 1 ), which is a contradiction. 4. Therefore, ( g'(x) ) must be either always positive or always negative for all ( x > 0 ). Suppose ( g'(x) > 0 ) for all ( x > 0 ). This would mean that ( g ) is strictly increasing. 5. Since ( g ) is not the identity function, there exists some ( h > 0 ) such that ( g(h) neq h ). 6. Consider the two possible cases: - If ( g(h) < h ), then applying ( g ) to both sides, we get: [ g(g(h)) = h implies h < g(h) < h ] This is a contradiction. - If ( g(h) > h ), then applying ( g ) to both sides, we get: [ g(g(h)) = h implies h > g(h) > h ] This is also a contradiction. 7. Since both cases lead to contradictions, the assumption that ( g'(x) > 0 ) for all ( x > 0 ) must be false. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that ( g'(x) < 0 ) for all ( x > 0 ), meaning ( g ) is strictly decreasing.

After the first player makes their move, the number of stones in the heap is ( m ). 6. **Analysis after the First Move**: - The number ( m ) after the first move is ( 2004! - k ), where ( k ) is the number of stones taken by the first player. Since ( k ) is permissible, it cannot be a multiple of ( l ). - Therefore, ( m ) is not divisible by ( l ). 7. **Strategy for the Second Player**: - The second player can always ensure that the remaining stones are divisible by ( l ) after their turn by taking a number of stones ( r ) such that ( r = m bmod l ). - This ensures that ( m - r ) will be some multiple of ( l ). 8. **Continuation**: - If the second player always takes stones according to the strategy described, the heap will alternate between states divisible and not divisible by ( l ). - This pattern continues until the number of stones left is small enough that the second player can force a win by taking the last stones. 9. **Conclusion**: By always ensuring that the heap is divisible by ( l ) (a multiple of the smallest non-allowed number), the second player would have control over the game and will ultimately win.

Given the scores, 9 appears four times, which is more than any other number. Therefore, the mode a = 9. - For scenic spot B, the median is given as 9.5. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. Since there are 10 scores, the median is the average of the 5^{text{th}} and 6^{text{th}} scores. Given that the median is 9.5, we have frac{9 + x}{2} = 9.5. Solving for x gives: [ 9 + x = 19 implies x = 10 ] - To find the average b of scenic spot B, we use the formula for the average, which is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. With x=10, the scores for scenic spot B are 10, 10, 8, 7, 6, 6, 10, 10, 9, 10. The sum of these scores is 86, and there are 10 scores, so the average b is: [ b = frac{86}{10} = 8.6 ] Therefore, the values are a = 9, x = 10, and b = 8.6. Part 2: Recommendation for Xiaoming Based on the data provided, the recommendation for Xiaoming would be to visit scenic spot B. The reasoning is as follows: - The average score for scenic spot B (8.6) is higher than that for scenic spot A (8.2). - The mode for scenic spot B (10) is higher than that for scenic spot A (9). - The median for scenic spot B (9.5) is higher than that for scenic spot A (9). Given that all three statistical measures (average, mode, and median) are higher for scenic spot B, it indicates that the overall evaluation of scenic spot B is higher than that of scenic spot A. Therefore, scenic spot B is recommended for Xiaoming. Final answers: - (1) a = 9, x = 10, b = 8.6 - (2) Recommend scenic spot B for Xiaoming.

To find the elements of T, we look for natural numbers x such that frac{6}{x - 2} is an integer.

They sit randomly around a round table with 9 chairs. What is the probability that each representative has at least one representative from another country sitting next to them?","completion":"# Problem: There are 9 representatives from different countries, 3 people from each country. They are randomly seated around a round table with 9 chairs. What is the probability that each representative has at least one representative from a different country seated next to them? 1. **Determine the total number of possible seating arrangements.** Since there are 9 representatives, the total number of arrangements of 9 distinct people around a circular table is given by (9-1)! = 8!. However, since we have 3 groups of 3 people (from the same country), the total number of arrangements is divided by the arrangements within each group. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange these representatives is: frac{9!}{3! times 3! times 3!} = frac{362880}{6 times 6 times 6} = 1680. 2. **Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion (PIE) to find the number of arrangements where at least one country’s representatives sit together.** Let A be the set of seating arrangements where all representatives of country 1 sit together. Define B and C similarly for countries 2 and 3. Using PIE, we have: |A cup B cup C| = (|A| + |B| + |C|) - (|A cap B| + |A cap C| + |B cap C|) + |A cap B cap C|. 3. **Calculate the sets individually:** - **|A|**: Choose any chair for the first representative of country 1. The two adjacent chairs are then automatically chosen for the other members of country 1. This leaves 6 chairs, which are to be filled by representatives of countries 2 and 3, providing binom{6}{3} times 3! times 3! = 20 times 6 times 6 = 720 arrangements. Since the block can be placed in any of the 9 positions around the table, |A| = 9 times frac{6!}{3! times 3!} = 9 times 20 = 180. - **|A cap B|**: Choose chairs for the 3 representatives from country 1 and the 3 representatives from country 2, ensuring they sit together. The block for country 1 could be placed starting at any of 9 positions, and for each, the block for country 2 can be in any 4 non-overlapping positions: |A cap B| = 9 times 4 = 36. - **|A cap B cap C|**: All countries sit together, essentially treating each “block” of 3 as one unit: |A cap B cap C| = 9 times 2 = 18. 4. **Summing up using PIE:** |A cup B cup C| = 3|A| - 3|A cap B| + |A cap B cap C| = 3 times 180 - 3 times 36 + 18 = 540 - 108 + 18 = 450. 5. **Finding the desired probability:** Finally, the number of favorable seating arrangements where no three representatives from the same country sit together is: 1680 - |A cup B cup C| = 1680 - 450 = 1230.

Let’s call these groups (G_1) and (G_2), respectively. 4. **Connectivity within Groups**: Each city in (G_1) is connected to at least 7 other cities. Similarly, each city in (G_2) is connected to at least 7 other cities. Since City A cannot reach City B, all the connections of any city in (G_1) must be within (G_1) itself, and similarly for (G_2). 5. **Counting the Cities: Insight**: Since there are 15 cities in total, the split between (G_1) and (G_2) must cover all these cities. Let (n_1) be the number of cities in (G_1) and (n_2) be the number of cities in (G_2), so (n_1 + n_2 = 15). 6. **Minimum Degree Constraint**: Each city in (G_1) is connected to at least 7 other cities within (G_1). Thus, (n_1 geq 8) since there must be at least 7 other cities in (G_1) for any city in (G_1).

This is a contradiction since we only have 15 cities in total (i.e., (n_1 + n_2 = 15)). 8. **Conclusion from Contradiction**: Therefore, our assumption that there are two cities (such as City A and City B) which cannot reach each other by any sequence of roads must be false. This means that the initial assumption was incorrect. Consequently, each city must be reachable from any other city, possibly through other cities.

However, this configuration is not possible for all vertices due to the total number of vertices and the need to use all numbers from 1 to 20. - Similarly, if n = 20, the neighbors must be 17, 18, 19 to avoid a difference greater than 3, which is also not possible for all vertices. 5. **General Case**: - For any number n assigned to a vertex, the neighbors must be chosen from the remaining 19 numbers. - If we try to avoid a difference greater than 3, the neighbors must be within the range [n-3, n+3]. - This range includes 7 numbers (if all are available), but since each vertex has 3 neighbors, and there are 20 vertices, it is impossible to maintain this range for all vertices without overlap or repetition. 6. **Conclusion**: - Given the constraints and the total number of vertices, it is inevitable that at least one pair of adjacent vertices will have a difference greater than 3. - This conclusion follows from the pigeonhole principle and the structure of the graph, which forces some vertices to have neighbors with a difference greater than 3.

There are 5 red pegs, so we need to place them in the remaining 5 rows and columns that do not already have a yellow peg. We continue this pattern for the green, blue, and orange pegs. For each color, the number of ways to place the pegs is determined by the number of available spots, which decreases as more pegs are placed.

Let these primes be ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_ell ). 2. **Minimal Set of Primes**: Consider the set of all choices of primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_ell ) and distinct integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots ) such that every prime divisor of any ( a_i a_j a_k - 1 ) is contained in ( {p_1, ldots, p_ell} ). Pick such a choice with minimal ( ell ). 3. **Residue Occurrence**: For any prime ( p_t ), we can assume each residue modulo ( p_t ) occurs infinitely often or no times at all. If not, we can throw away all instances of that residue, which contradicts the minimality of ( ell ). 4. **Residue Cubes**: For any prime ( p_t ) and a residue ( r pmod{p_t} ), we have ( r^3 equiv 1 pmod{p_t} ). If not, we can select only ( a_i ) congruent to ( r ) modulo ( p_t ) and use ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{t-1}, p_{t+1}, ldots, p_ell ) as the set of primes, contradicting the minimality of ( ell ). 5. **Single Residue**: For any prime ( p_t ), only one residue ( r pmod{p_t} ) needs to occur for the ( a_i ). If not, we can throw away any other residue, which contradicts the minimality of ( ell ). 6. **Monotonic Sequence**: Define ( f_p(a) ) to be ( nu_p(a^3 - 1) ). We can throw away ( a_i ) to ensure that the sequence ( f_{p_1}(a_i) ) is monotonically increasing. This is done by taking ( a_2 ) to be the next ( a_i ) with ( f_{p_1}(a_i) ge f_{p_1}(a_1) ) and so on. If this algorithm runs out of terms, throw away all ( a_i ) taking on the maximal value of ( f_{p_1}(a_i) ) and start over.

This ensures that each sequence of ( f_{p_i}(a_j) ) is constant or unbounded. 8. **Bounded Sequence**: For every prime ( p_i ), the sequence of ( nu_{p_i}(a_1 a_2 a_j - 1) ) for ( j ge 3 ) is bounded above. If ( nu_{p_i}(a_j) ) is unbounded, suppose that the sequence ( nu_{p_i}(a_1 a_2 a_j - 1) ) is unbounded as well for contradiction. Let ( a_j ) be large and ( t = min(k, ell) ) where ( ell = f_{p_i}(a_j) ) and ( k = nu_{p_i}(a_1 a_2 a_j - 1) ). Then [ frac{1}{a_1^3 a_2^3} equiv a_j^3 equiv 1 pmod{p_i^t}. ] This occurs if and only if ( p_i^t mid a_1^3 a_2^3 - 1 ). But ( s = nu_{p_i}(a_1^3 a_2^3 - 1) ge t ), so ( t ) is bounded.

We need to find all ( n ) such that ( x_n = 1995 ). 1. **Prime Factorization of 1995:** - First, factorize 1995 into its prime factors. - Dividing by smallest prime (3): ( 1995 div 3 = 665 ) - Dividing 665 by smallest prime (5): ( 665 div 5 = 133 ) - Dividing 133 by smallest prime (7): ( 133 div 7 = 19 ) - Lastly, 19 is a prime number. - Hence, ( 1995 = 3 times 5 times 7 times 19 ). 2. **Understanding ( p(x) ):** - ( p(x) ) is defined as the least prime that does not divide ( x ). 3. **Understanding ( q(x) ):** - ( q(x) ) is the product of all primes less than ( p(x) ). 4. **General Progression of ( x_n ):** - By induction and the problem definition, all ( x_n )'s are square-free. - Assign a unique code to each ( x_n ) according to which primes divide it. 5. **Binary Representation of ( x_n ):** - The pattern indicates that if the code for ( x_n ) is treated as a binary number, ( f ) acts as an addition of 1. - Thus, ( f(x_n) = x_{n+1} ) effectively means transforming the binary code of ( x_n ) by adding 1. 6. **Binary Code for 1995:** - Determine the position of 1995 in the sequence using binary representation. - The prime factor representation of 1995 includes the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 19. - Convert ( 1995 = 3 times 5 times 7 times 19 ) to binary based on prime positions. - Excluding 2: - 3 = prime 1 - 5 = prime 2 - 7 = prime 3 - 19 = prime 8 - This translates to ( 1995 ) being represented by the binary code ( 10001110_2 ). 7. **Binary to Decimal Conversion:** - Convert ( 10001110_2 ) to a decimal. - The conversion yields ( 1 cdot 2^7 + 0 cdot 2^6 + 0 cdot 2^5 + 0 cdot 2^4 + 1 cdot 2^3 + 1 cdot 2^2 + 1 cdot 2^1 + 0 cdot 2^0 = 128 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 142 ). # Conclusion: Thus, the sequence ( x_n ) corresponding to 1995 is at ( n = 142 ).

How much time does it take for the train to cross a tree?","completion":"To find the time it takes for the train to cross a tree, we need to determine the speed of the train. When the train passes the platform, it covers the combined length of the train and the platform. The total distance covered when passing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform: Total distance = Length of train + Length of platform Total distance = 1200 m + 1200 m Total distance = 2400 m The train takes 240 seconds to cover this distance. To find the speed of the train, we use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Speed of train = Total distance / Time taken to pass the platform Speed of train = 2400 m / 240 s Speed of train = 10 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train, we can calculate the time it takes to cross a tree. When crossing a tree, the train only needs to cover its own length, which is 1200 m. Using the speed we found, we can calculate the time it takes to cross the tree: Time = Distance / Speed Time to cross a tree = Length of train / Speed of train Time to cross a tree = 1200 m / 10 m/s Time to cross a tree = 120 s Therefore, it takes the train boxed{120} seconds to cross a tree."},{"prompt":"Mrs. Lopez and her family are going to the movie theatre.

Using the side length information in a creative way (though it's not an isosceles triangle), let's state angle YZX = 2x due to their opposite proportions to the sides YZ and XY respectively.

How can the line be constructed on the sheet that connects a given point on the sheet with one of the intersection points of the circles?","completion":"# Problem: On a sheet, two arcs from circles are given, but their intersection points cannot fit on the paper. How can you construct the line on the sheet that connects a given point on the sheet to one of the intersection points of the circles? I. Solution 1. Let the given point be (P), and let the circles with centers (O_1) and (O_2) be (k_1) and (k_2), respectively. We need to connect point (P) with one of the intersection points, (M), of (k_1) and (k_2). Our goal is to construct the line (P M). 2. Select 3 points each from the arcs (k_1) and (k_2) that lie on the paper. Using these points, reduce the scale of the circles by half from point (P). If we cannot fit the reduced circles on the paper because their centers do not lie on the paper, or if the intersection point of the reduced circles still does not fit on the paper, reduce the scale further by half. Continue this process until the reduced circles (k_1') and (k_2') have their intersection point (M') fitting on the paper. This process will terminate after a finite number of steps because the radius of the circles and their distance from (P) halve with each step. 3. The reduced circles (k_1') and (k_2') have point (P) as their center and are homothetic to circles (k_1) and (k_2). Therefore, point (M) (the intersection in the original circles) can be obtained by scaling (M') from (P). Thus, points (P), (M'), and (M) are collinear, meaning the line (P M') is the desired line (P M). # Conclusion: Therefore, the line (P M') is the line that connects (P) with the intersection point (M) of the circles. [ boxed{PM'} ] II. Solution 1. Draw a circle (k) which entirely lies on the sheet and encloses point (P) and the arcs of the circles (k_1) and (k_2). 2. Invert the plane with respect to this new circle (k). Let’s denote the center of (k) by (O). The inversion will map points outside (k) to inside it and vice versa. 3. Chose three points on each original circle (k_1) and (k_2), invert these points, and the circumcircle of these three inverted points will be the inverted image of circles (k_1) and (k_2). 4. Because point (P) and original circles (k_1) and (k_2) are outside circle (k), their images after inversion, including the intersection points (A') and (B') of the inverted circles, will be inside circle (k). 5. If the inverted point (P'), the intersection (A'), and the center (O) are collinear, then the desired line is (OA'). Inverting (OA') yields the desired line. 6. If points (A', P', O) are not collinear, then find the circumcircle of triangle (A'P'O). This circle’s inverse will be a line that is the desired line (PM). 7. If the circumcircle of (A'P'O) does not completely fit on the paper, reduce the radius of circle (k) and repeat the inversion process until the circumcircle fits on the paper. 8. If the circumcircle of (A'P'O) intersects (k), the line through these intersection points is the desired line. 9. If circumcircle (c) lies entirely within (k), continue looking for another point on (c) invertible onto the paper until you have successfully inverted a point back onto the paper. Conclusion: The line obtained after successful inversion and intersection fitting processes is the desired line connecting point (P) with one of the intersection points of circles (k_1) and (k_2).

First, we understand that the equation 10x - 4.9x^2 = 5 has two roots, which means there are two distinct times at which the ball's height is exactly 5m above the ground. These times are x_1 approx 0.88 seconds and x_2 approx 1.16 seconds. Option A suggests the height of the ball is 5m after approximately 1.02s, which is not directly related to either of the roots, making it incorrect. Option B states the ball reaches a height of 5m above the ground after approximately 0.88s. This interpretation directly corresponds to one of the roots (x_1), indicating that it is a correct interpretation of one of the times the ball reaches 5m in height. Option C suggests the ball reaches 5m at 1.16s and will continue to rise, which is incorrect because at 1.16s, the ball is actually starting to descend after reaching its peak height. Option D states the time interval between the ball reaching a height of 5m above the ground twice is approximately 0.28s.

The logic behind this is that m is perpendicular to every line in plane alpha, and since plane alpha is parallel to plane beta, every line in alpha has a corresponding parallel line in beta.

Therefore, the coordinates of the cube’s vertices are in the form (x, y, z) where x, y, and z independently take values in {0, 3}. 2. **Diagonal Movement Analysis** When moving diagonally across a small square within a face, one coordinate remains constant while the other two coordinates change by pm 1. This movement results in a change in the sum of the coordinates by an even number (either +2 or -2). 3. **Parity Considerations** To create a connected path across the diagonals, only vertices whose sum of coordinates have the same parity can be used. Each small square’s diagonal connects two vertices that have the same parity of their coordinate sum. 4. **Traversal Constraints** To create a closed non-self-intersecting broken line, each vertex corresponding to the sum of coordinates having the same parity must be visited. However, the extreme vertices of the cube (corners) will have mixed parity. Specifically: - Vertices (0, 0, 0), (0, 3, 3), (3, 0, 3), and (3, 3, 0) have even coordinate sums. - Vertices (0, 0, 3), (0, 3, 0), (3, 0, 0), and (3, 3, 3) have odd coordinate sums. Each of these vertices is shared by three small squares. Visiting a vertex implies crossing at least two diagonals of the small squares which share that vertex, thereby blocking the third diagonal and precluding further movement. 5. **Conclusion** Thus, it is impossible to draw a closed non-self-intersecting broken line such that each small square of the Rubik's cube has one of its diagonals included. This proof also implies that even an open broken line following the same rules would necessitate precisely four end points, rendering such a line impossible.

Find the least possible positive integer n with the following property: no matter how the points are coloured, there is always a triangle with area n that has its 3 vertices with the same colour.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that no matter how we color the points on the plane with integer coordinates using three colors (red, green, blue), there will always be a triangle with area ( n ) whose vertices are all the same color. 2. **Area of a Triangle with Integer Coordinates:** The area ( A ) of a triangle with vertices at ((x_1, y_1)), ((x_2, y_2)), and ((x_3, y_3)) can be calculated using the determinant formula: [ A = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right| ] Since the coordinates are integers, the expression inside the absolute value is an integer. Therefore, the area ( A ) is either an integer or a half-integer. For ( A ) to be an integer, the expression inside the absolute value must be even. 3. **Pigeonhole Principle:** Consider a large enough grid of points. By the pigeonhole principle, if we color these points with three colors, there will be many points of the same color. We need to ensure that among these points, we can always find a triangle with the desired area. 4. **Finding the Smallest ( n ):** We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that any coloring of the plane will result in a monochromatic triangle with area ( n ). 5. **Constructing Triangles:** Let's consider small values of ( n ) and check if we can always find a monochromatic triangle with that area. - For ( n = 1 ): Consider the points ((0,0)), ((2,0)), and ((1,1)). The area of the triangle formed by these points is: [ A = frac{1}{2} left| 0(0 - 1) + 2(1 - 0) + 1(0 - 0) right| = frac{1}{2} left| 0 + 2 + 0 right| = frac{1}{2} times 2 = 1 ] We need to check if we can always find such a triangle regardless of the coloring. 6. **Generalizing the Argument:** For any ( n ), we need to ensure that there is no way to color the points such that all triangles of area ( n ) are not monochromatic. This involves considering larger grids and ensuring that the pigeonhole principle forces a monochromatic triangle of the desired area. 7. **Conclusion:** After considering various configurations and applying the pigeonhole principle, we find that the smallest ( n ) that guarantees a monochromatic triangle of area ( n ) is ( n = 1 ).

We can calculate the volume of the box by multiplying these dimensions together: Volume = Length x Width x Height We know the volume is 3120, and we are given the width as 16 and the height as 13. We need to find the length (L): 3120 = L x 16 x 13 To find the length, we divide the volume by the product of the width and height: L = 3120 / (16 x 13) L = 3120 / 208 L = 15 So, the length of the box is boxed{15} units."},{"prompt":"We will call the diagonal of a convex 101gon a main diagonal if it has 50 vertices on one side and 49 vertices on the other side. Several main diagonals, which do not share endpoints, have been selected. Prove that the sum of the lengths of these diagonals is less than the sum of the lengths of the remaining main diagonals. (I. Bogdanov, S. Berlov)","completion":"We are given a convex 101-gon, and we need to show that the sum of lengths of selected \\"main diagonals\\" that do not share any endpoints is less than the sum of lengths of the remaining \\"main diagonals\\". Definitions: A **main diagonal** of a polygon with an odd number of sides (2n+1) is a segment (A_i A_{i+n}). Here, we use cyclical numbering of vertices so that (A_{i+2n+1} = A_i). Induction Base Case: For (n = 1), the polygon in question is a triangle, where each \\"main diagonal\\" is one of its sides. The inequality directly follows from the triangle inequality stating that for any triangle (ABC), (AB + BC > AC). Induction Hypothesis: Assume the statement is true for a convex polygon with (2n+1) sides. That is, for a polygon (K) with vertices (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2n+1}), the sum of the lengths of any set of chosen main diagonals, not sharing endpoints, is less than the sum of lengths of the remaining main diagonals. Inductive Step: Consider a convex polygon (K) with (2(n+1)+1 = 2n+3) vertices. Select a main diagonal (A_1 A_{n+3}). By definition of \\"main\\", this diagonal splits the polygon into two parts, one with vertices (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{n+3}) and the other up to (A_{2n+3}). 1. **Non-selected Main Diagonals**: Diagonals such as (A_1 A_{n+2}) and (A_2 A_{n+3}) are non-selected and intersect at some point (P). From the triangular inequality in the triangle (A_1 P A_{n+3}), [ A_1 A_{n+3} + A_2 A_{n+2} < A_1 P + P A_{n+3} + A_2 P + P A_{n+2} = A_1 A_{n+2} + A_2 A_{n+3} ] 2. **Adjusted Polygons**: Consider now the polygon (M) with vertices (A_2, ldots, A_{n+2}, A_{n+4}, ldots, A_{2n+3}). The main diagonals for (M) include (A_2 A_{n+2}) and extend as described. 3. **Applying Induction Hypothesis**: By induction hypothesis, the sum of lengths of the main diagonals chosen in (M) (excluding (A_1 A_{n+3})) satisfies: [ (s_1 - A_1 A_{n+3}) < (s_2 - A_1 A_{n+2}) - A_2 A_{n+2} ] 4. **Combining Inequalities**: Adding the non-selected diagonal inequality to the above: [ s_1 - A_1 A_{n+3} < s_2 - A_1 A_{n+2} - A_2 A_{n+2} + A_2 A_{n+2} ] We simplify to get: [ s_1 < s_2 - A_1 A_{n+2} ] Since the lengths of the diagonals (A_1 A_{n+2}) and (A_2 A_{n+3}) satisfy the conditions laid out, we can conclude as desired: [ s_1 < s_2 ] Hence, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for any polygon with (2n+1) sides. # Conclusion: We have shown that the sum of lengths of any chosen main diagonals of a considered (2n+1)-gon is less than the sum of lengths of the remaining main diagonals.

This indicates that the difference between consecutive terms is non-decreasing. Since it is given that a_{1} > a_{2}, we have a_{2}-a_{1} < 0. To satisfy these conditions, we can choose the first four terms of a sequence {a_{n}} as follows: - a_{1}=2 - a_{2}=1 - a_{3}=7 - a_{4}=15 These terms satisfy the given condition because the differences between consecutive terms increase, starting from a negative difference (a_{2}-a_{1} < 0). Part (1)(ii) Given a_{n+1}-a_{n}geqslant a_{n}-a_{n-1} for all ngeqslant 2, we can write a series of inequalities: - a_{n}-a_{n-1}geqslant a_{n-1}-a_{n-2} - a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}geqslant a_{n-2}-a_{n-3} - ... - a_{4}-a_{3}geqslant a_{3}-a_{2} - a_{3}-a_{2}geqslant a_{2}-a_{1} Summing these inequalities, we get a_{n}-a_{2}geqslant (n-2)(a_{2}-a_{1}).

Then swapping (a_1) and (b_1) would increase the number of cross roads, contradicting the maximal property of the partition (A, B). 4. **Existence of neighbors:** Thus, such two cities do not exist.

The equation of the parabola C is y^2 = 8x, and its focus F is at (2, 0) since the focal length (p) is 2 and the parabola opens to the right (x=p for the focus of a parabola y^2 = 4px). The directrix of the parabola is a vertical line to the left of the focus, and its equation is x = -p, thus for our parabola x = -2. The distance |FM| can be expressed as the horizontal distance from M to the focus, which is x_0 - 2. Thus, we have the inequality: |FM| = x_0 - 2 > 4 Solving for x_0, we get: x_0 > 4 + 2 x_0 > 6 But since the circle with radius |FM| must intersect the directrix at x = -2, the actual distance |FM| must be greater than the distance from F to the directrix, which is 2+2=4.

Therefore, we set: [ 1990n + frac{1990 times 1989}{2} = m ] We solve for ( n ): [ 1990n = m - frac{1990 times 1989}{2} ] [ 1990n = m - 995 times 1989 ] [ 1990n = frac{2m - 1990 cdot 1989}{2} ] [ 1990n = frac{2 cdot 5^{10} cdot 199^{180} - 1990 cdot 1989}{2} ] To make sure ( n ) is an integer, it must be of the form: [ n = frac{5^9 cdot 199^{179} - 1989}{2} ] Thus, by choosing ( n = frac{5^{9} cdot 199^{179} - 1989}{2} ), we can confirm: [ m = 1990n + frac{1990 cdot 1989}{2} ] This completes part (a). 2. **(b) There are exactly 1990 different ways to write ( m ) as the sum of consecutive integers:** Consider writing: [ m = n + (n+1) + cdots + (n+k) ] The sum of these ( k+1 ) terms is given by: [ m = (k+1)n + frac{k(k+1)}{2} ] This can be rearranged into: [ 2m = (k+1)(2n + k) ] Given ( m = 5^{10} cdot 199^{180} ), we express this as: [ 2m = 2^{1} times 5^{10} times 199^{180} ] We require factor pairs of ( 2m ). The prime factorization yields: [ 2m = 2^1 times 5^{10} times 199^{180} ] Among these factors, ( 2m ) has ( 2 times 11 times 181 = 3982 ) factors in total. Removing the pairs where ( b = a ), we get: [ frac{3982}{2} = 1991 ] However, ignoring the pair ((1, 2m)), we find ( 1990 ) different pairs ((a, b)) where each pair generates a unique pair of ( k ) and ( n ). Given that ( b > a ), set ( k = a - 1 ) and ( n = frac{b - a + 1}{2} ) ensuring ( n ) is a natural number. Therefore, we've shown forming exactly ( 1990 ) such sums. **Conclusion:** Thus, ( m ) can be expressed as the sum of 1990 consecutive integers in exactly 1990 different ways.

According to the problem, there are 10 people who play kabadi. This includes people who play only kabadi and those who play both games. Similarly, there are 35 people who play only kho kho. Since some people play both games, they are being counted twice in the total of 45 players. Once in the kabadi count and once in the kho kho count. To find the number of people who play both games, we need to subtract the number of people who play only one game from the total number of players. The total number of players who play kabadi, kho kho, or both is 45. This total is made up of three groups: 1. People who play only kabadi 2. People who play only kho kho 3. People who play both We can express this total as: Total players = Only kabadi + Only kho kho + Both games We know that: Only kabadi = 10 - x (since x people play both, they are not included in the \\"only kabadi\\" count) Only kho kho = 35 (given in the problem) Both games = x (the number we want to find) So, the equation becomes: 45 = (10 - x) + 35 + x Now, let's solve for x: 45 = 10 - x + 35 + x 45 = 45 + x - x (since x - x cancels out) 45 = 45 Since the x terms cancel out, it means that the number of people who play only kabadi is equal to the number of people who play both games.

At x = 2, g'(x) = 0, suggesting a potential extremum. For x in (2, +infty), g'(x) > 0, indicating that g(x) is increasing.

We find the minimum value of g(x) at this point: [ g(2) = frac{e^2}{2^2} = frac{e^2}{4}. ] Since for x > 0, g(x) is always greater than its minimum: [ g(x) geq frac{e^2}{4} > 1, ] which implies that: [ f(x) = g(x) cdot x > 1 cdot x = x. ] Thus, we have proved that f(x) > x for x > 0.

Since (AM = BE = 3), we can use the properties of medians and centroids to deduce that (triangle ABC) is isosceles. 2. **Centroid Properties:** The centroid (O) divides each median into a ratio of (2:1). Therefore, (AO = frac{2}{3}AM) and (BO = frac{2}{3}BE). Since (AM = BE), it follows that (AO = BO). 3. **Congruence of Triangles:** By the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Congruence Theorem, (triangle AOM cong triangle BOM) because: - (AO = BO) - (OM) is common - (angle AOM = angle BOM) (since (O) is the centroid and divides the medians equally) Hence, (triangle AOM cong triangle BOM). 4. **Isosceles Triangle:** Since (triangle AOM cong triangle BOM), it follows that (AM = BM). Therefore, (triangle ABC) is isosceles with (AC = BC). 5. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:** Given that points (O, M, E, C) lie on one circle, we can use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. Specifically, opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to (180^circ). 6. **Angle Chasing:** Let (angle A = angle B = angle CEM = angle CME).

Consider the set M = {1, 2, ldots, 2n} and we need to find the smallest integer k such that every k-element subset of M contains four distinct elements whose sum is 4n + 1. 2. Start by considering the subset P = {n-1, n, n+1, ldots, 2n}, which contains n + 2 elements. We will check if this subset meets the condition. 3. In subset P, consider any four distinct elements a, b, c, d. To check if their sum is at least 4n + 1, note: [ min(P) = n-1, quad max(P) = 2n. ] Therefore, [ text{Sum of the smallest 4 elements} = (n-1) + n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 4n + 1. ] This implies that any subset of P with four distinct elements will have a sum (geq 4n + 1), meaning subsets of size n + 2 from M meet the condition of the problem. Consequently, we need at least n + 2 elements to guarantee such a subset sum condition, suggesting k geq n + 3. 4.

Pair elements in M into (n) distinct pairs as follows: [ B_i = (i, 2n+1-i) quad text{for } 1 leq i leq n. ] There are (n) such pairs. 6. Any subset (A) of size (n + 3) from (M) must have (n + 3 > n) elements, ensuring at least one pair (B_i) repeats in the subset. This guarantees at least three pairs ((B_{i_1}, B_{i_2}, B_{i_3})) within (A). Thus, choose pairings so each B_i is split among (A). 7. Additionally, for subset (A), ensure (A) includes at least one more distinct pair from the remaining elements set: [ C_i = (i, 2n - i) quad text{for } 1 leq i leq n-1. ] Subset (A) being (n + 3) implies having elements to form the pair (C_{i_4}) adding to previous selection. 8. Finally, such construction ensures that the fourth pair does not repeat elements of the previous three pairs, giving four distinct elements whose sum is (2n + 1 + 2n = 4n + 1).

Given that there are 100 boxes numbered from 1 to 100, the key is to ensure that each possible location of the prize corresponds uniquely to a different set of answers. 1. **Understand the nature of questions and answers**: Each question needs to have a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" answer which helps narrow down the location of the prize. The unique answers to all questions should differentiate each box. 2. **Determine the criteria for the number of questions needed**: Since each box must be uniquely identified, the combination of \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" answers must be able to produce at least 100 different outcomes. 3. **Use the binary search principle**: In binary terms, we need a sequence of bits (\\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" answers) to create at least 100 unique sequences. Mathematically, this can be expressed using the formula for the number of different combinations of binary sequences of length k: [ 2^k geq 100 ] Solving for k: [ k geq log_2(100) ] Calculating the value: [ log_2(100) approx 6.644 ] Hence, ( k ) must be at least 7 (since the number of questions must be an integer). 4. **Practical number of questions needed**: With 7 questions, you can theoretically have ( 2^7 = 128 ) different answers, which is more than enough to uniquely identify 100 boxes. However, this solution needs fewer because all items are sorted and questions do not reduce the sample space perfectly.

We will use mathematical induction on n. Base Case: Let's consider n = 1. For n = 1, the graph should have 2n = 2 vertices. We need two vertices both of which have degree 1. These two vertices can simply be connected by an edge. - Let the vertices be v_1 and v_2, and connect them by an edge (v_1, v_2). - In this case, deg(v_1) = 1 and deg(v_2) = 1. This forms a simple graph with 2 vertices having the degrees 1, 1. Therefore, the base case holds. Induction Step: Assume the statement is true for some integer n = k; that is: - There exists a graph G_k with 2k vertices where the degrees of vertices are 1, 1, 2, 2, ldots, k, k. We need to show that there exists a graph with 2(k + 1) = 2k + 2 vertices where the degrees of these vertices are 1, 1, 2, 2, ldots, k, k, k+1, k+1. 1. **Start with the graph G_k** defined for 2k vertices. 2. **Add two new vertices**, let's name them A and B. 3. Connect the vertex A to: - One existing vertex of each degree from 1 to k. - Vertices connected to A: v_1, v_2, ldots, v_k. 4. **Degree adjustment**: - Vertices v_i (1 leq i leq k) originally having degrees 1, ldots, k will now have degrees 2, ldots, k+1 respectively after being connected to A. - The vertex A will now have degree k because it's connected to k vertices. 5. **Connect remaining new vertex** B to only A to ensure: - Vertex A now finally gets an additional degree making its total degree k+1. - Vertex B gets degree 1 by connecting only to A. Thus, the degrees of the vertices in the new graph G_{k+1} will be: - 1, 1, 2, ldots, k-1 from the original vertices unchanged. - 2, ldots, k, k+1 from the original vertices updated after connecting to A. - Additional k+1 from vertex A and 1 from the vertex B. So the graph now contains 2(k + 1) = 2k + 2 vertices, with the necessary degrees 1, 1, 2, 2, ldots, k, k, k+1, k+1. Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.

If not, explain why she would refuse such an offer.","completion":"Let's address the problem in a detailed, step-by-step manner. We will differentiate between parts (a) and (b) as given. Part (a): First, we should find the maximum amount Maria Ivanovna can donate each month. Below are the assumptions and steps that need to be clarified. 1. The various elements of her day are: - She sleeps 9 hours. - She works L_i hours as a tutor. - She spends 2L_i hours on her hobby of knitting. - She spends k_i hours on rest and household chores. - The total daily hours are always 24. By balancing these, we have: [ L_i + 2L_i + k_i + 9 = 24 ] Here, (L_i) represents the number of hours she works on a given day (i) and (k_i) represents the number of hours she spends on rest and household chores. Simplifying: [ 3L_i + k_i = 15 ] This can be rearranged as: [ k_i = 15 - 3L_i ] 2. Her earnings from tutoring each day can be expressed as: [ text{Daily earnings} = 2L_i text{(in thousand rubles)} ] 3. The daily donations are given by: [ text{Daily donation} = frac{k_i}{3} text{(in thousand rubles)} ] Using the substitution (k_i = 15 - 3L_i): [ text{Daily donation} = frac{15 - 3L_i}{3} = 5 - L_i ] 4. Maria Ivanovna has a passive investment income of 30 thousand rubles per month and spends a fixed amount of 60 thousand rubles per month, excluding donations. Hence, the monthly equation is: [ 30 + sum_{i=1}^{20} 2L_i = 60 + sum_{i=1}^{20} frac{k_i}{3} ] Combining the equations: [ 30 + 2L_1 + 2L_2 + cdots + 2L_{20} = 60 + frac{k_1 + k_2 + cdots + k_{20}}{3} ] Using the substitution for (k_i): [ 30 + 2L_1 + 2L_2 + cdots + 2L_{20} = 60 + frac{(15 - 3L_1) + (15 - 3L_2) + cdots + (15 - 3L_{20})}{3} ] Simplifying the sum components: [ sum_{i=1}^{20} k_i = 20 cdot 15 - 3sum_{i=1}^20 L_i = 300 - 3sum_{i=1}^{20} L_i ] Thus, the equation becomes: [ 30 + 2sum_{i=1}^{20} L_i = 60 + frac{300 - 3sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i}{3} ] [ 30 + 2sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i = 60 + 100 - sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i ] [ 30 + 2sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i - 100 + sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i = 60 ] [ 3sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i = 130 ] [ sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i = frac{130}{3} approx 43.33 ] Summarizing the months: [ text{Total monthly donation} = frac{300 - 3L - 3sum_{i=1}^{20}L_i}{3} = frac{300 - 3 times frac{130}{3}}{3} = frac{170}{3} approx 56.67 ] Therefore, Maria Ivanovna can donate: [ boxed{56.67} text{thousand rubles per month} ] Part (b): Parents are proposing additional tutoring hours at an increased rate ( A ), where Maria has to make a decision whether the extra pay compensates for her time spent on rest and hobbies. To ensure she accepts, the additional pay ( A ) must satisfy that she is not foregoing her personal and donation time. Therefore, ( A ) should be: Each additional hour ((L_{text{extra}})): [ text{Earnings per extra working hour} = 2 times text{previous rate} = 2 times 2 = 4 text{To make it acceptable, the increment must exceed this extra pay rate or } boxed{A geq 4} ] Hence, it must be: [ boxed{4} text{thousand rubles per hour} ]"},{"prompt":"Solve for n: |n + 4| = 3 n.","completion":"We solve for n by considering the absolute value operation.

Solving for n, we add n to both sides and subtract 3: 2n + 4 = 3, 2n = -1, n = -frac{1}{2}. Since -frac{1}{2} geq -4, this solution is valid. **Case 2:** n + 4 < 0, i.e., n < -4. Here, the equation transforms to: -(n + 4) = 3 - n. Simplifying this, we have: -n - 4 = 3 - n. This leads to a statement where all n terms cancel out: -4 = 3, which is clearly false.

It is known that for any natural number ( n ), there exist exactly ( n ) cards on which the divisors of this number are written.

For any natural number ( n ), there exist exactly ( n ) cards, each marked with a divisor of ( n ). We aim to prove that every natural number appears at least on one card. 2. **Understanding the Divisors**: Given a natural number ( n = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_k^{alpha_k} ), where ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) are distinct prime numbers and ( alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_k ) are their respective positive powers.

Each such divisor ( d ) of ( n ) is also a divisor of some [ frac{n}{p_i} text{ for } i = 1, 2, ldots, k. ] 4. **Use of Set Notation**: Define ( A_i ) as the set of cards on which a divisor of ( frac{n}{p_i} ) is written. Hence, we define: [ A_i = { text{cards with divisors of } frac{n}{p_i} }. ] 5. **Intersection of Sets**: - ( A_{i_1} cap A_{i_2} cap ldots cap A_{i_l} ) is the set of cards where divisors of (frac{n}{p_{i_1} p_{i_2} cdots p_{i_l}} ) are written. 6. **Cardinality of Sets**: - According to the problem definition, we have: [ |A_{i_1} cap A_{i_2} cap cdots cap A_{i_l}| = frac{n}{p_{i_1} p_{i_2} cdots p_{i_l}} ] where (|A|) denotes the cardinality of set (A). 7. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: - Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of cards where divisors of ( n ) less than ( n ) are written can be computed as: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} |A_i| - sum_{1 le i < j le k} |A_i cap A_j| + sum_{1 le i < j < l le k} |A_i cap A_j cap A_l| - cdots + (-1)^{k+1} |A_1 cap A_2 cap cdots cap A_k| ] - Substituting the values of (|A_{i_1} cap A_{i_2} cap cdots cap A_{i_l}|), we have: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} frac{n}{p_i} - sum_{1 le i < j le k} frac{n}{p_i p_j} + cdots + (-1)^{k+1} frac{n}{p_1 p_2 cdots p_k} ] 8. **Simplification**: - The aforementioned expression is equivalent to the total number of ways to choose non-empty subsets of ( { p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k } ): [ n left( sum_{i=1}^{k} frac{1}{p_i} - sum_{1 le i < j le k} frac{1}{p_i p_j} + cdots + (-1)^{k+1} frac{1}{p_1 p_2 cdots p_k} right) = n (1 - 1) = 0 ] Therefore, the number of cards with divisors of ( n ) less than ( n ) totals to ( n - 1 ). 9. **Conclusion**: - This means there are ( n - 1 ) cards where the divisor written is less than ( n ). Hence, there must be exactly one card where the divisor is ( n ) itself. Thus, each natural number appears on at least one card, which concludes the solution.

Specifically, for large ( n ), ( F_n ) is approximately: [ F_n approx frac{phi^n}{sqrt{5}} ] where ( phi = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ) is the golden ratio. Step 3: Approximate the term for large ( k ). For large ( k ), ( F_{2k+1} ) grows exponentially, so we can approximate: [ F_{2k+1}^2 gg 1 ] Thus, the term simplifies to: [ frac{4F_{2k+1}}{F_{2k+1}^2 + 1} approx frac{4F_{2k+1}}{F_{2k+1}^2} = frac{4}{F_{2k+1}} ] Step 4: Sum the series.

Therefore, the series: [ sum_{k=1}^infty frac{4}{F_{2k+1}} ] also converges to a finite value. Step 6: Conclude the limit.

To prove f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty), we find its derivative: [f'(x) = e^{x-1} + frac{1}{x} - 2.] We define g(x) = e^{x-1} + frac{1}{x} - 2 to analyze the sign of f'(x). The derivative of g(x) is: [g'(x) = e^{x-1} - frac{1}{x^2}.] Both components of g'(x), y = e^{x-1} and y = -frac{1}{x^2}, are increasing functions on (0, +infty). Therefore, g'(x) is monotonically increasing on this interval. Since g'(1) = 0, it implies g(x) is decreasing on (0, 1) and increasing on (1, +infty).

Thus: [ PA > k, quad PB > k, quad PC < k, quad PD < k ] 4. **Consider Points ( Q ) on the Ellipse:** For any point ( Q ) on the ellipse, consider the expression ( PQ - k ): - At points ( A ) and ( B ), ( PQ - k ) is positive. - At points ( C ) and ( D ), ( PQ - k ) is negative. By continuity and the intermediate value theorem, there must be points on the ellipse where ( PQ = k ) and ( PQ ) is stationary, meaning ( PQ ) is normal to the ellipse. 5. **Identify Relevant Points:** - There must be a point ( A' ) near ( A ) where ( PA' ) is a local maximum and hence ( PA' > k ). - Similarly, a point ( B' ) near ( B ) where ( PB' > k ). - A point ( C' ) near ( C ) where ( PC' < k ). - A point ( D' ) near ( D ) where ( PD' < k ). 6. **Assume Point ( P ):** Assume ( P ) is in the quadrant ( AOC ) and not on either axis. Consider the reflection ( D'' ) of ( D' ) in the line ( AB ): [ PD'' = PD' quad (D'' text{ lies near } C') ] - Since ( PC' ) is a minimum, we have ( PD'' geq PC' ).

Let's denote the number of bronze rubles by x, the number of silver coins (worth 9 rubles each) by y, and the number of gold coins (worth 81 rubles each) by z. We are given the following conditions: - There are a total of 23 coins: [ x + y + z = 23 ] - The total sum is less than 700 rubles: [ x + 9y + 81z < 700 ] 2. First, we establish the maximum number of gold coins possible: - The maximum total value if all coins were gold is: [ 81z < 700 implies z < frac{700}{81} approx 8.64 ] - Since z must be an integer, the maximum value for z is 7. 3. Given z leq 7, we now determine the minimum number of bronze and silver coins: - Maximum possible value for z: [ z = 7 ] - Substitute z = 7 into the total coin equation: [ x + y = 23 - 7 = 16 ] 4. Next, let's examine the feasible combinations for x and y.

Solving f'(x) = 0 gives x = 0. - When a > 0, + If x > 0, then e^(ax) > 1, so f'(x) > 0. + If x < 0, then e^(ax) < 1, so f'(x) < 0. - When a < 0, + If x > 0, then e^(ax) < 1, so f'(x) > 0. + If x < 0, then e^(ax) > 1, so f'(x) < 0. Therefore, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval [0, +∞) and decreasing on the interval (-∞, 0). 2. Proof: From part 1, we know that if f(x) has two zeros, then x_{1} < 0 < x_{2} and f(0) = e^{0} - a(0 + 2) < 0, so a > frac{1}{2}. Let e^{ax_{1}} = t_{1} and e^{ax_{2}} = t_{2}. Then ax_{1} = ln t_{1} and ax_{2} = ln t_{2}. So, t_{1} and t_{2} are the two roots of the equation t - ln t - 2a = 0. Let g(t) = t - ln t - 2a. Then, t_{1} and t_{2} are the two zeros of g(t), and 0 < t_{1} < 1 < t_{2}. Therefore, g(2 - t_{1}) - g(t_{2}) = g(2 - t_{1}) - g(t_{1}) = 2 - t_{1} - ln(2 - t_{1}) - 2a - (t_{1} - ln t_{1} - 2a) = 2 - 2t_{1} - ln(2 - t_{1}) + ln t_{1}. Let h(t_{1}) = 2 - 2t_{1} - ln(2 - t_{1}) + ln t_{1}, where t_{1} in (0, 1). Then, h'(t_{1}) = -2 + frac{1}{2 - t_{1}} + frac{1}{t_{1}} = frac{2(t_{1} - 1)^{2}}{(2 - t_{1})t_{1}} > 0. So, h(t1) is strictly increasing on (0, 1), hence h(t_{1}) < h(1) = 0. Therefore, g(2 - t_{1}) - g(t_{2}) < 0, i.e., g(2 - t_{1}) < g(t_{2}). Since g'(t) = 1 - frac{1}{t} = frac{t - 1}{t}, g(t) is strictly increasing when t in (1, +infty). As (2 - t_{1}), t_{2} in (1, +infty), we have 2 - t_{1} < t_{2}, so t_{1} + t_{2} > 2.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Establish Initial Values and First Few Terms:** Calculate the first few terms for both sequences: [ begin{aligned} a_0 &= 2, a_1 &= 14, a_2 &= 14 cdot 14 + 2 = 198, a_3 &= 14 cdot 198 + 14 = 2786, a_4 &= 14 cdot 2786 + 198 = 39202. end{aligned} ] [ begin{aligned} b_0 &= 2, b_1 &= 14, b_2 &= 6 cdot 14 - 2 = 82, b_3 &= 6 cdot 82 - 14 = 478, b_4 &= 6 cdot 478 - 82 = 2786. end{aligned} ] Observing the initial terms: [ begin{aligned} a_0 &= 2, a_1 &= 14, a_2 &= 198, a_3 &= 2786, a_4 &= 39202, a_5 &= 551614, a_6 &= 7761798, a_7 &= 109216786. end{aligned} ] [ begin{aligned} b_0 &= 2, b_1 &= 14, b_2 &= 82, b_3 &= 478, b_4 &= 2786, b_5 &= 16238, b_6 &= 94642, b_7 &= 551614. end{aligned} ] 2. **Identify Matching Values in Both Sequences:** From the calculated terms we observe: - a_0 = b_0 = 2 - a_1 = b_1 = 14 - a_3 = b_4 = 2786 - a_5 = b_7 = 551614 - a_7 = b_{10} = 109216786 3. **Deriving the Patterns in Sequences:** We have the following sequences extracted from a_n and b_n that match: [ left(a_{2k+1}right) implies 14, 2786, 551614, 109216786, ldots ] [ left(b_{3k+1}right) implies 14, 2786, 551614, 109216786, ldots ] Both left(a_{2k+1}right) and left(b_{3k+1}right) have the same initial terms. 4. **Use of Lemmas:** **Lemma 1:** - This lemma states that if x_n satisfies a homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order d, then the subsequence left(x_{tm+r}right) also satisfies a homogeneous linear recurrence relation of order d. **Lemma 2:** - If two sequences satisfy homogeneous linear recurrence relations of the same order d and match in the first 2d terms, then they match for all n geq 0. Applying Lemma 1 to both a_{2k+1} and b_{3k+1}, we conclude that both subsequences also satisfy linear recurrence relations of order 2. Since both subsequences have the same first four matching initial terms and satisfy linear recursions, Lemma 2 guarantees that the sequences will be equal for all indices. # Conclusion: We have shown that the subsequences left(a_{2k+1}right)_{k ge 0} and left(b_{3k+1}right)_{k ge 0} are identical by confirming their first few matching values and using the established lemmas.

According to the information given, the sale price of the dress was 68. Therefore, we can write the equation: [ 0.85P = 68 ] Now, let's solve for ( P ): [ P = frac{68}{0.85} ] [ P = 80 ] So the original price of the dress was 80. The difference between the original price and the final price is 5, which means the final price is ( P - 5 ), or 80 - 5, which equals 75. Now, we need to find out by what percentage the store raised the new price from 68 to 75. The increase in price is ( 75 - 68 = 7 ).

Since ( S(9) = 9 ), we have ( S(f(9)) = f(9) ). - This implies ( f(9) ) is a single-digit number. - Given that ( f ) is strictly increasing and maps positive integers to positive integers, ( f(n) geq n ).

We are given that among 100 numbers, there exist both positive and negative numbers. The problem requires underlining each positive number as well as each number where the sum with the next number is positive. 1. **Notation and Representation:** - Let ( a ) represent a negative number that is highlighted because its sum with the next number is positive. - Let ( b ) be the next number after ( a ). By the problem's condition, ( b ) should be positive, and the sum ( a + b ) must also be positive, i.e., ( a + b > 0 ). 2. **Highlighting Rule:** - Positive numbers are highlighted individually. - Negative numbers that, when added to the next number, give a positive sum are highlighted. This means any highlighted negative number ( a ) is followed by a positive number ( b ) such that ( a + b > 0 ). 3. **Breaking Down the Series:** - To find out if the sum of all highlighted numbers can be negative or zero, we separate the series into: - Pairs where a negative number is highlighted along with its following positive number. - All other positive numbers that are highlighted individually. 4. **Summation Analysis:** - Consider a pair ((a, b)) where ( a ) is negative and ( b ) is positive. [ a + b > 0 ] - The sum of this pair is positive by definition. - Now, consider all positive numbers ([p_1, p_2, ldots]) which are highlighted individually.

When a=1, the inequality f(x) > 1 becomes log_2(frac{1}{x} + 1) > 1. Thus, we have frac{1}{x} + 1 > 2, which simplifies to frac{1}{x} > 1. Solving for x, we get 0 < x < 1. After verification, this satisfies the condition. Therefore, the solution set for the inequality is (0, 1). 2. The equation f(x) + log_2(x^2) = 0 is equivalent to log_2(frac{1}{x} + a) + log_2(x^2) = 0. Therefore, (frac{1}{x} + a)x^2 = 1, which simplifies to ax^2 + x - 1 = 0. If a=0, the equation becomes x - 1 = 0, which has a solution x = 1. Upon verification, this satisfies the condition that there is exactly one solution in the solution set. If a neq 0, let the discriminant Delta = 1 + 4a = 0. Solving for a gives a = -frac{1}{4}, and we find x = 2. Upon verification, this also satisfies the condition with exactly one element in the solution set. In summary, a = 0 or a = -frac{1}{4}. 3. Since a > 0, for any t in [frac{1}{2}, 1], the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval [t, t+1]. Therefore, log_2(frac{1}{t} + a) - log_2(frac{1}{t+1} + a) leq 1.

Hence, g(t) is monotonically decreasing on the interval [frac{1}{2}, 1]. At t = frac{1}{2}, g(t) attains its maximum value, g(frac{1}{2}) = frac{2}{3}. Therefore, a geq frac{2}{3}.

That is, if a region inside the circle was colored with the first color, we now color it with the second color, and vice versa. c. **Verification:** To verify that this procedure results in a valid coloring: - Consider two regions that share a boundary and lie entirely inside the added circle. Originally, these regions were colored differently (by induction hypothesis). After inversion, their colors remain different because we switched both regions' colors simultaneously. - Consider two regions that share a boundary and lie entirely outside the added circle. These regions' colors were not changed, so, by our induction hypothesis, they are colored differently. - Consider regions that share a boundary where one is inside and the other outside the circle. Before adding the new circle, these regions were part of the same larger region and hence had the same color. After adding the new circle and inverting the color inside, one region will have its color changed, so these two regions will now have different colors. By this process, we have shown that the plane can be colored using two colors for (n+1) circles such that adjacent regions have different colors. Conclusion: By the principle of mathematical induction, the result holds for any integer (n geq 0).

Thus, the i-th term of the sequence can be expressed as: [ a_i = a_1 + (i-1)d, ] where d is the common difference of the sequence. 1. **Sum of the Arithmetic Series**: The sum of the terms from a_{n+1} to a_{2n+1} for an arithmetic sequence is given by: [ sum_{i=n+1}^{2n+1} a_{i} = frac{(n+1)}{2} (a_{n+1} + a_{2n+1}). ] 2. **Expressing the Terms with the Common Difference**: To substitute back into this formula, we realize: [ a_{n+1} = a_1 + nd, ] [ a_{2n+1} = a_1 + 2nd. ] Hence, the sum becomes: [ sum_{i=n+1}^{2n+1} a_{i} = frac{(n+1)}{2} (a_{n+1} + a_{2n+1}). ] Simplifying the terms inside the sum: [ a_{n+1} + a_{2n+1} = (a_1 + nd) + (a_1 + 2nd) = 2a_1 + 3nd. ] Therefore, [ sum_{i=n+1}^{2n+1} a_{i} = frac{(n+1)}{2} (2a_1 + 3nd). ] 3. **Applying the Given Condition**: Given ( a_1^2 + a_{n+1}^2 leq frac{2}{5} ), we use the identity ( a_{n+1} = a_1 + nd ). Substitute ( nd = a_{n+1} - a_1 ) back, the required term simplifies to: [ 2a_1 + 3nd = 2a_1 + 3(a_{n+1} - a_1) = 3a_{n+1} - a_1. ] Thus, we get: [ sum_{i=n+1}^{2n+1} a_{i} = frac{(n+1)}{2} (3a_{n+1} - a_1). ] 4. **Bounding the Expression**: We need to bound this expression. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the given condition: [ (3a_{n+1} - a_1)^2 leq (3^2 + 1^2)(a_{n+1}^2 + a_1^2). ] Simplifying: [ (3a_{n+1} - a_1)^2 leq 10(a_{n+1}^2 + a_1^2). ] Given ( a_1^2 + a_{n+1}^2 leq frac{2}{5} ): [ 10(a_{n+1}^2 + a_1^2) leq 10 times frac{2}{5} = 4. ] Hence, [ (3a_{n+1} - a_1)^2 leq 4. ] Taking the square root on both sides: [ |3a_{n+1} - a_1| leq 2. ] Therefore, [ frac{(n+1)}{2} |3a_{n+1} - a_1| leq frac{(n+1)}{2} cdot 2 = n+1. ] 5. **Final Conclusion**: [ sum_{i=n+1}^{2n+1} a_{i} leq n+1. ] Thus, the inequality is proven. boxed"},{"prompt":"f nheartsuit m=n^2m^3, what is frac{2heartsuit 4}{4heartsuit 2}? textbf{(A)} frac{1}{2}qquadtextbf{(B)} 1qquadtextbf{(C)} 2qquadtextbf{(D)} 4qquadtextbf{(E)} 8","completion":"1. **Define the operation heartsuit:** Given n heartsuit m = n^2 m^3, we need to evaluate frac{2 heartsuit 4}{4 heartsuit 2}. 2. **Calculate 2 heartsuit 4:** [ 2 heartsuit 4 = 2^2 cdot 4^3 = 4 cdot 64 = 256. ] 3. **Calculate 4 heartsuit 2:** [ 4 heartsuit 2 = 4^2 cdot 2^3 = 16 cdot 8 = 128. ] 4. **Form the ratio frac{2 heartsuit 4}{4 heartsuit 2}:** [ frac{2 heartsuit 4}{4 heartsuit 2} = frac{256}{128} = 2. ] 5. **Conclusion:** The value of frac{2 heartsuit 4}{4 heartsuit 2} is 2.
