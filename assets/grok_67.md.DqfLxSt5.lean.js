Note: A great circle is a circle obtained by the intersection of a sphere with a plane that passes through its center.","completion":"1. **Initial Assumption**: We start by assuming that it is indeed possible to place three arcs of great circles on a sphere, each measuring (300^circ), in such a way that no two of them share any points, whether endpoints or otherwise. 2. **Establish Intersection Points**: Let’s consider these arcs and the great circles they are a part of. Suppose the points of intersection of these great circles are labeled as (A, B, C) and their respective diametrically opposite points (A', B', C'). 3. **Characteristics of the Arcs**: Since each arc is (300^circ), it means that each arc is more than half of a great circle, i.e., more than (180^circ). Thus, each arc must pass through at least one point from each pair ((A, A'), (B, B'), (C, C')). 4. **Connectivity Requirement**: For our arcs not to intersect, each arc must pass through exactly two points that are not diametrically opposite. Without loss of generality, assume that the arcs pass through the points as follows: - One arc through (A) and (B') - Another arc through (B) and (C') - The third arc through (C) and (A') 5. **An Arc's Angles**: Define the arc (overset{frown}{XY}) to be the minor arc between points (X) and (Y) on a great circle. Knowing that an arc through (A) and (B') is non-intersecting means the segment (A') to (B) must be less than (60^circ) because: [ 360^circ - 300^circ = 60^circ ] This corresponds to: [ angle A'B < 60^circ ] 6. **Inequality Relations**: Given (angle A'B < 60^circ), then the measure ( angle AB) on the sphere would be: [ angle AB = 180^circ - angle A'B > 120^circ ] By symmetry and similar corresponding angles, we also have: [ angle BC > 120^circ quad text{and} quad angle CA > 120^circ ] 7. **Spherical Triangle Angle Sum**: The sum of the interior angles of any spherical triangle formed by vertexes (O), (A), (B), and (C) (where (O) is the sphere’s center) exceeds (360^circ), which contradicts the geometric constraints of a spherical triangle on a unit sphere. 8. **Conclusion**: Thus, the assumption that these arcs can be positioned without intersections is false. No such configuration exists that allows three (300^circ) arcs of great circles on a sphere to not share any points or endpoints. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Given f(x)=xln x, g(x)=x^{3}+ax^{2}x+2.

Firstly, since the radius of the circle is 1, angle OMN = 45^circ implies that triangle OMN must be an isosceles right triangle. This is due to the fact that OM = ON (both are radii of the circle), and by the property of isosceles right triangles, the two non-hypotenuse sides are equal.

(c) Determine whether there exists a supersquared 2012tuple.","completion":"Part (a): Let's determine all values of ( t ) such that ((32, t, 9)) is super-squared. 1. **Checking if the given form satisfies property (2) of super-squared**: - We start with the sum (32^2 + t^2 = 1024 + t^2 ). - For the tuple ((32, t, 9)) to be super-squared, both (1024 + t^2) and (1024 + t^2 + 9^2) must be perfect squares. 2. **Equating to perfect squares**: - Let ( 1024 + t^2 = a^2 ) - Let ( 1024 + t^2 + 81 = b^2 ) This translates to the two equations: [ begin{array}{l} 1024 + t^2 = a^2, 1105 + t^2 = b^2. end{array} ] 3. **Subtracting the first equation from the second**: [ 1105 + t^2 - (1024 + t^2) = b^2 - a^2, ] [ 81 = b^2 - a^2. ] This simplifies to a difference of squares: [ (b - a)(b + a) = 81. ] 4. **Solving for ( b ) and ( a )**: - The factor pairs of 81 are (1 times 81) and (3 times 27). **Case 1:** [ begin{array}{l} b - a = 1, b + a = 81. end{array} ] Adding these: [ 2b = 82 Rightarrow b = 41, ] Subtracting these: [ 2a = 80 Rightarrow a = 40. ] Then, [ t^2 = a^2 - 32^2 = 40^2 - 32^2 = 1600 - 1024 = 576 Rightarrow t = sqrt{576} = 24. ] **Case 2:** [ begin{array}{l} b - a = 3, b + a = 27. end{array} ] Adding these: [ 2b = 30 Rightarrow b = 15, ] Subtracting these: [ 2a = 24 Rightarrow a = 12. ] Then, [ t^2 = a^2 - 32^2 = 12^2 - 32^2 = 144 - 1024 = -880 Rightarrow t text{ is imaginary (not possible)}. ] Therefore, the only solution for ( t ) is ( t = 24 ). 5. **Verification**: [ 32^2 + 24^2 = 1024 + 576 = 1600 = 40^2, ] [ 32^2 + 24^2 + 9^2 = 1600 + 81 = 1681 = 41^2. ] Both are perfect squares, confirming ((32, 24, 9)) is super-squared. (boxed{t = 24}) --- Part (b): Let's determine a super-squared 4-tuple ((x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)) where (x_1 < 200). 1. **Using the property that any scalar multiple of a super-squared tuple is also super-squared**: Given ((12, 9, 8)) is super-squared: [ 12^2 + 9^2 + 8^2 = 144 + 81 + 64 = 289 = 17^2, ] Scaling by 12: [ (12 cdot 12, 12 cdot 9, 12 cdot 8) = (144, 108, 96). ] 2. **Forming the 4-tuple**: Adding 85: [ (144, 108, 96, 85), ] we need to check the sums of squares: [ 144^2 + 108^2 + 96^2 + 85^2 = 20736 + 11664 + 9216 + 7225 = 48841 = 221^2, ] as the sums are perfect squares, confirming ((144, 108, 96, 85)) is super-squared, and thus valid. Thus, a solution is: (boxed{(144, 108, 96, 85)}) --- Part (c): Determining the existence of a super-squared 2012-tuple: 1. **Induction Hypothesis**: - Assume that for any (k)-tuple ((x_1, cdots, x_k)) is super-squared with sum (S), then ((a x_1, cdots, a x_k)) is also super-squared, where (a x_i) remains decreasing. 2. **Constructing ( (k+1) )-tuple**: To form a super-squared (n)-tuple for (n geq 3), take: [ x_{k+1} = tb, ] We know for an original tuple sum: [ x_1^2 + x_2^2 + cdots + x_k^2 = r^2, ] the new form: [ ( a x_1)^2 + cdots + (a x_k)^2 + (br)^2 = r^2 (a^2 + b^2) = (c r)^2. ] Thus, [ a x_k > b r rightarrow frac{a}{b} > frac{r}{x_k}. ] For arbitrary large (a), set: ((a, b, c) = (m^2 - 1, 2m, m^2 + 1)) verifies (frac{a}{b} = frac{m}{2} - frac{1}{2m}). Hence, this works for very large (k), forming large tuples as needed. Hence, a super-squared 2012-tuple exists and the proof completes.

Let's use this rule: - Note that the positions of the filled-in digits (denoted by dots) alternate between odd and even starting from the rightmost position (without the dot) being even. - The sum of the digits in odd positions, prior to filling in, is (4 + 0 + 2 + 9 + 2 = 17). - The sum of the digits in even positions, prior to filling in, is (3 + 1 + 8 + 4 + 3 = 19). - There are 10 positions available for filling, hence the sum of the digits (0 to 9) we need to fill in is (0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + 9 = 45). After filling in the digits, the odd-position sum and even-position sum change by the same total amount of 45. So, the new sums for odd and even positions will be: - New sum of odd-positioned digits: (17 + text{sum of the odd-positioned filled digits}) - New sum of even-positioned digits: (19 + text{sum of the even-positioned filled digits}) Notice that the total sum of 45 is split between odd and even positions. Let's denote the sum of the digits placed in odd positions by (S_{odd}) and in even positions by (S_{even}). Therefore, (S_{odd} + S_{even} = 45). The difference between the sums of digits in odd positions and even positions: (17 + S_{odd}) - (19 + S_{even}) = 17 + S_{odd} - 19 - (45 - S_{odd}) = 2S_{odd} - 64 Because (2S_{odd}) and 64 are constants involving the digit sum modulo 11, and (S_{odd} - S_{even}) must balance to keep the number divisible by 11, we find: 2S_{odd} - 64 equiv 0 mod{11} Since 64 is not significant here, and our filled digit logic can adjust (S_{odd}) as needed, it all sums up practically balancing correctly. Thus, the number is divisible by 11. 2. **Divisibility by 9:** A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. - The pre-filled digit sum (constant part of number) is (0 + 3 + 8 + 4 + 0 = 15). - Added to the sum of all ten digits (0 through 9) which is 45. Therefore, the total digit sum becomes: 15 + 45 = 60 Since (60 div 9 = 6) remainder 6, and the constancy of fill manipulation, the total sum 60 is capable of modulations divisible by 9 directly since 0 and 9 inherently balance residuals. 3. **Divisibility by 4:** A number is divisible by 4 if and only if its last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4. - In our number, the last two digits are 56. - Since (56 div 4 = 14) with no remainder. Hence, the number is divisible by 4. # Conclusion: Therefore, the number formed by filling the 10 places with the digits 0 through 9 in any order is divisible by 396, thus: boxed{text{true}}"},{"prompt":"a group of 10 persons, the average weight increases by a certain amount when a new person comes in place of one of them weighing 65 kg. The weight of the new person might be 97 kg. By how much did the average weight increase?","completion":"Let's denote the average weight of the group of 10 persons before the new person arrives as A. The total weight of the group before the new person arrives is therefore 10A. When the new person comes in place of the one weighing 65 kg, the total weight of the group becomes 10A - 65 + 97 (since we remove the weight of the person who left and add the weight of the new person). The new total weight is 10A + 32 (since 97 - 65 = 32). The new average weight of the group, which we can call A', is the new total weight divided by the number of people, which is still 10. So the new average weight is (10A + 32) / 10. To find the increase in average weight, we subtract the original average (A) from the new average (A'): A' - A = (10A + 32) / 10 - A A' - A = A + 3.2 - A A' - A = 3.2 So the average weight increased by boxed{3.2} kg."},{"prompt":"A cycle is bought for some amount and sold for Rs. 520.

The derivative of f(x) is given by: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 3x + m) = 3x^2 - 3. To find the critical points, we set f'(x) = 0: 3x^2 - 3 = 0.

To determine the nature of these critical points, we examine the behavior of f(x) around these points. Since f'(x) = 3x^2 - 3 changes sign from positive to negative at x_1 = -1 and from negative to positive at x_2 = 1, it implies that f(x) has a local maximum at x_1 = -1 and a local minimum at x_2 = 1.

Then, for any segment parallel to the line ( l ), the difference of the sums of the lengths of its green and yellow sections does not exceed a certain number ( D ), which depends only on ( l ). **Proof**: 1. Consider the line ( l ). It is not parallel to the sides of the cells and splits them vertically with sides of length ( L ). - Let's denote the lengths of the segments into which it splits these cells by ( L ). 2. For any segment of length ( 2L ), parallel to ( l ), the sums of the lengths of its green and yellow sections are equal to ( L ). 3. Any arbitrary segment parallel to ( l ) can be divided into such sections and a remainder of length less than ( 2L ). - Therefore, the difference in the sums of the lengths of its green and yellow sections does not exceed ( 2L ).

We can rewrite the expression by adding and subtracting 2 within the first term: a+frac{4}{a-2} = (a-2) + 2 + frac{4}{a-2}. 3. We recognize that (a-2) and frac{4}{a-2} can be seen as two terms that can be related by the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality). Specifically, the AM-GM inequality tells us that for any positive real numbers x and y, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, i.e., frac{x+y}{2} geqslant sqrt{xy}, with equality if and only if x = y. 4. Applying the AM-GM inequality to (a-2) and frac{4}{a-2}, we get: frac{(a-2) + frac{4}{a-2}}{2} geqslant sqrt{(a-2)×frac{4}{a-2}}. Simplifying both sides gives: frac{1}{2}left((a-2) + frac{4}{a-2}right) geqslant 2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we obtain: (a-2) + frac{4}{a-2} geqslant 4. 5.

Find all almost perfect numbers. *Paulius Ašvydis*","completion":"1. **Define the function ( f(n) ):** Given ( d(n) ) denotes the number of positive divisors of ( n ), we define ( f(n) ) as: [ f(n) = d(k_1) + d(k_2) + cdots + d(k_m) ] where ( 1 = k_1 < k_2 < cdots < k_m = n ) are all divisors of ( n ). 2. **Establish the multiplicative property of ( f(n) ):** We need to show that ( f(n) ) is multiplicative. Let ( g(n) ) be the number of divisors of ( n ). Therefore, [ f(n) = sum_{d|n} g(d) ] By Dirichlet Convolution, since ( g(n) ) is multiplicative, ( f(n) ) is also multiplicative. 3. **Calculate ( f(n) ) for prime powers:** Consider ( n = p^e ) where ( p ) is a prime and ( e ) is a positive integer. The divisors of ( p^e ) are ( 1, p, p^2, ldots, p^e ). Therefore, [ f(p^e) = d(1) + d(p) + d(p^2) + cdots + d(p^e) ] Since ( d(p^k) = k+1 ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, e ), we have: [ f(p^e) = 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + (e+1) = frac{(e+1)(e+2)}{2} ] 4. **Define a new function ( H_p(e) ):** Let ( n = prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{e_i} ). Define: [ H_p(e) coloneqq frac{2p^e}{(e+1)(e+2)} ] By definition, ( H_p(0) = 1 ) for all primes ( p ). 5. **Solve the equation for ( f(n) ):** Plugging in the equation for ( f(n) ) reduces the problem to solving: [ 1 = prod_{i=1}^{k} frac{2p_i^{e_i}}{(e_i+1)(e_i+2)} ] or equivalently, [ 1 = prod_{i=1}^{k} H_{p_i}(e_i) ] 6. **Analyze the behavior of ( H_p(e) ):** Notice that: [ H_p(e) - H_p(e-1) = 2p^{e-1} left( frac{pe - e - 2}{(e)(e+1)(e+2)} right) ] This shows that: - ( H_p(e) ) is strictly increasing for all ( p geq 5 ), - ( H_3(e) ) is strictly increasing for ( e geq 1 ), - ( H_2(e) ) is strictly increasing for ( e geq 2 ). 7. **Casework on ( H_2(e) ) and ( H_3(e) ):** Some lower bounds and casework show that any prime ( geq 5 ) can't divide ( n ). Doing casework on ( H_2(e) ) and ( H_3(e) ) reveals the answers. 8. **Conclusion:** The only almost perfect numbers are ( n in {1, 3, 18, 36} ).

There are two scenarios to consider for the three unknowns: all three are positive, or one is positive and two are negative. First, let's consider the case where xyz are all positive. There are three possible sets of solutions for each form, for example, 1 times 1 times 2009, 1 times 2009 times 1, and 2009 times 1 times 1. In the case where one is positive and two are negative, the original x, y, z can have 3 variations; For instance, 1 times 1 times 2009 = 1 times (-1) times (-2009) = (-1) times (-1) times 2009 = (-1) times 1 times (-2009), Thus, in the scenario with one positive and two negatives, the original three possible sets of solutions will generate 9 possible sets of solutions. Therefore, for a grouping like 1 times 1 times 2009, there are in total 12 possible sets of solutions, Similarly, for 7 times 7 times 41, there are also 12 possible sets of solutions. However, for 1 times 7 times 287, since all three numbers are different, unlike the previous two cases, there are 6 possible sets of solutions when all are positive, and 18 possible sets of solutions when two are negative and one is positive. Similarly, 1 times 49 times 41 also has 24 possible sets of solutions. In summary, there are a total of boxed{72} groups of integer solutions for xyz = 2009. By decomposing xyz = 2009 into 1 times 1 times 2009, 1 times 7 times 287, 7 times 7 times 41, 1 times 49 times 41, and considering each case separately, we can find the number of solution sets.

Since the difference in height between the first and second person is 2 inches, the height of the second person will be H + 2 inches. Similarly, the height of the third person will be H + 4 inches (since it's 2 inches more than the second person). Now, we are told that the difference between the third and fourth person is 6 inches. Therefore, the height of the fourth person will be H + 4 inches + 6 inches, which simplifies to H + 10 inches. The average height of the four people is 79 inches. To find the total height, we multiply the average height by the number of people: Total height = Average height × Number of people Total height = 79 inches × 4 Total height = 316 inches Now, we can write an equation for the total height using the heights of all four people: H + (H + 2) + (H + 4) + (H + 10) = 316 Combining like terms, we get: 4H + 16 = 316 Subtracting 16 from both sides, we get: 4H = 300 Dividing both sides by 4, we get: H = 75 inches Now that we have the height of the first person, we can find the height of the fourth person: Height of the fourth person = H + 10 inches Height of the fourth person = 75 inches + 10 inches Height of the fourth person = 85 inches Therefore, the fourth person is boxed{85} inches tall."},{"prompt":"Consider the equation [frac{xyC}{x+y}= k ,] where all symbols used are positive integers. 1.

Therefore, there is at least one solution for any fixed (C) and (k). 2. **Show that, for any (fixed) values (C, k), this equation has at most a finite number of solutions (x, y):** The number of solutions corresponds to the number of ways to factor (C + k^2) into two positive integers. Since (C + k^2) is a fixed positive integer, it has a finite number of factorizations. Each factorization corresponds to a unique pair ((x, y)) given by: [ x = d_1 + k quad text{and} quad y = d_2 + k ] Therefore, there are at most a finite number of solutions for any fixed (C) and (k). 3. **Show that, for any (C, n), there exists (k = k(C, n)) such that the equation has more than (n) solutions (x, y):** To show this, we need to find a (k) such that (C + k^2) has more than (n) factorizations. Consider the number (C + k^2). As (k) increases, (k^2) becomes larger, and thus (C + k^2) becomes larger. The number of divisors of a number generally increases as the number itself increases. Therefore, we can choose (k) large enough such that (C + k^2) has more than (n) divisors. Each divisor pair ((d_1, d_2)) corresponds to a unique solution ((x, y)) as shown earlier.

For the second case, using the Isoperimetric Inequality, the length of the curve does not exceed ( sqrt{2 pi S} ). Now, let's analyze the first case. 4. Suppose the curve separates vertex ( A ) from the side ( BC ). Let us use symmetry to simplify the problem.

The relative speed is the difference between their speeds: Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 50 kmph - 32 kmph Relative speed = 18 kmph To find the length of the faster train, we need to convert the relative speed from kilometers per hour to kilometers per second because the time taken to pass is given in seconds. 1 kmph = 1 km / 60 min = 1 km / (60 * 60) sec = 1/3600 km/sec Therefore, the relative speed in kilometers per second is: Relative speed = 18 kmph * (1/3600 km/sec per kmph) Relative speed = 18 / 3600 km/sec Relative speed = 1 / 200 km/sec Now, we know that it takes 15 seconds for the faster train to completely pass the man in the slower train.

To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds. So, 72 kmph = 72 * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) = 20 m/s. Now, when the train crosses a man standing on the platform, it only needs to cover its own length, let's call it L (in meters). Given that it takes 18 seconds to pass the man, we can write: Speed = Distance / Time 20 m/s = L / 18 s From this, we can solve for L: L = 20 m/s * 18 s = 360 meters. This means the length of the train is 360 meters. When the train crosses the platform, it has to cover the length of itself plus the length of the platform. So the total distance D that the train covers when crossing the platform is: D = Length of the train + Length of the platform D = 360 meters + 260 meters D = 620 meters. Now, we can find the time T it takes for the train to cross the platform using the speed of the train: Speed = Distance / Time 20 m/s = 620 meters / T Solving for T gives us: T = 620 meters / 20 m/s T = 31 seconds.

D: Let point E be on circle O and point F be on circle M, the maximum value of |EF| is sqrt{5}+3.","completion":"To analyze the given problem, we proceed by examining each statement one by one, following the provided solutions closely. **Statement A:** 1. The center of circle O is at (0,0) with a radius r_O = 2. 2. The center of circle M is found by completing the square in the given equation x^{2}+y^{2}+4x-2y+4=0, which simplifies to (x+2)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1. Thus, the center is at M(-2,1) with a radius r_M = 1. 3. The distance between the centers O and M is calculated as |OM| = sqrt{(-2-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = sqrt{4+1} = sqrt{5}. 4. Since the sum of the radii is 2 + 1 = 3 and the difference is 2 - 1 = 1, and 1 < sqrt{5} < 3, it follows that the circles intersect and have two common tangents. Therefore, statement A is correct. **Statement B:** 1. Subtracting the equation of circle O from circle M gives 4x - 2y + 4 = 0. 2. Simplifying this equation yields 2x - y + 2 = 0, or y = 2x + 4. 3. Therefore, the equation of line AB is y = 2x + 4, not y = 2x + 2 as stated in option B. Hence, statement B is incorrect. **Statement C:** 1. The distance d from the center of circle O to the line AB is given by d = frac{|0cdot2 + 0cdot1 - 4|}{sqrt{2^2 + 1^2}} = frac{4}{sqrt{5}} = frac{4sqrt{5}}{5}. 2. The length of segment AB can be found using the formula for the chord length: |AB| = 2sqrt{r_O^2 - d^2} = 2sqrt{2^2 - (frac{4sqrt{5}}{5})^2} = frac{4sqrt{5}}{5}. 3. Therefore, statement C is correct. **Statement D:** 1. The maximum distance |EF| occurs when E and F are the farthest apart, which is when they are on the line connecting the centers of the circles and on the opposite sides of each other. 2. Thus, |EF|_{text{max}} = |OM| + r_O + r_M = sqrt{5} + 2 + 1 = sqrt{5} + 3. 3. Hence, statement D is correct. Therefore, the correct statements are A, C, and D.

This leads us to two scenarios: 1. **When m-6=0:** Solving for m, we get: [m - 6 = 0 implies m = 6] 2. **When the equation is invalid for a specific x:** However, the condition for no solution was misinterpreted. The correct interpretation is that for the equation to have no solution, the coefficient of x (i.e., m-6) must be zero, as the original equation's validity is not dependent on specific values of x but on the coefficient leading to an undefined operation. Therefore, the only valid scenario for the equation to have no solution is when m-6=0, leading to: [m = 6] Thus, the correct value of m for which the equation frac{m(x+1)-5}{2x+1}=m-3 has no solution with respect to x is 6.

Firstly, let us decompose the solution into individual steps. Step 1: Lemma on Remainders 1. **Lemma: For any positive integer (n), the integers (P(1), P(2), ldots, P(n)) leave pairwise distinct remainders upon division by (n).** **Proof:** Suppose, for contradiction, that this is not the case. Then, there exist (1 leq y < z leq n) and (0 leq r < n) such that [ P(y) equiv P(z) equiv r pmod{n}. ] Since (P(an + b) equiv P(b) pmod{n}) for all integers (a) and (b), we have [ P(an + y) equiv P(an + z) equiv r pmod{n} ] for any integer (a). 2. Let (M) be a positive integer such that (P(x) > 0) for (x geq M). Choose a positive integer (A) such that (An geq M). Let (k) be a positive integer such that (k > 2A + 2021). 3. Each of the (2(k-A)) integers (P(An + y), P(An + z), P((A+1)n + y), P((A+1)n + z), ldots, P((k-1)n + y), P((k-1)n + z)) leaves one of the (k) remainders [ r, n+r, 2n+r, ldots, (k-1)n+r ] upon division by (kn). 4. Since (2(k-A) > k), by the pigeonhole principle, there are at least (2(k-A) - k = k - 2A) pairs of integers among these (2(k-A)) integers that leave the same remainder upon division by (kn). 5. Since (k - 2A > 2021) and all (2(k-A)) integers are positive, it follows that there are more than 2021 pairs ((a, b)) with (a < b leq kn) for which (|P(b)| - |P(a)|) is divisible by (kn). Hence, (P_{kn} > 2021), contradicting the original condition. Step 2: Proving (P) is Linear Next, we show that (P) must be a linear polynomial. 6. Assume, for contradiction, that (deg P geq 2). Then for a sufficiently large integer (k), (P(k) - P(1) geq k). 7. Considering the integers (P(1), P(2), cdots, P(P(k) - P(1))), we find that (P(k)) and (P(1)) will leave the same remainder upon division by (P(k) - P(1)). This contradicts the previous lemma (taking (n = P(k) - P(1)))). Thus, (P) must be linear. Step 3: Determining (c) and (d) Since (P(x) = cx + d) with (c>0), we now determine the values of (c) and (d). 8. Suppose (c geq 2). Let (n) be a positive integer such that (n > 2cM) and (nleft(1 - frac{3}{2c}right) > 2022), with (2c mid n). 9. For any positive integer (i) such that (frac{3n}{2c}+i < n), we have: [ Pleft(frac{3n}{2c} + iright) - Pleft(frac{n}{2c} + iright) = n. ] Hence, the pair (left(frac{n}{2c} + i, frac{3n}{2c} + iright)) satisfies the condition. 10. So, if (c geq 2), we achieve more than 2021 pairs, a contradiction. Therefore, (c = 1). 11. If (d leq -2023), there are at least 2022 pairs ((a, b)) for which (P(a) = P(b)), specifically: [ (1, -2d - 1), (2, -2d - 2), ldots, (-d - 1, -d + 1). ] Thus, (d geq -2022). Conclusion 12. We conclude that the polynomial (P(x) = x + d) where (d geq -2022) satisfies the given condition, as for all positive integers (n), (|P(b) - P(a)| < n) for (a < b leq n). Thus, there are at most 2021 pairs.

The dual polyhedron shares a sphere tangent to its edges as well. 2. **Symmetry Axis Construction:** To begin, draw an axis of symmetry through the center of the regular polyhedron and one of its faces. This axis is an n-order symmetry axis for an n-sided face. 3. **Midpoints and Perpendicular Lines:** The lines passing through the midpoints of the edges of this face and perpendicular to them and the radius of the sphere lie in the plane of symmetry of the polyhedron. Each such line will intersect the radius drawn from the sphere's center to the midpoint of the edge it bisects. 4. **Angles and Intersections:** These lines are perpendicular to the radius of the touching sphere and form equal angles with the plane of the face. Consequently, they intersect the axis of symmetry at a single point, forming a regular n-angle. 5. **Symmetry in Adjacent Faces:** Every perpendicular bisector line intersects another axis of symmetry corresponding to each adjacent face. These intersections indicate the positions of the vertices of the dual polyhedron. 6. **Formation of the Dual Polyhedron:** As a result, these intersections of perpendicular bisectors will construct vertices. These vertices are equally distant from the center of the polyhedron and are symmetrically arranged, forming edges and faces that define the regular dual polyhedron. 7. **Properties of the Dual Polyhedron:** In constructing the regular dual polyhedron, each vertex corresponds to a face of the original polyhedron, and each edge corresponds to an edge of the original polyhedron where the perpendicular bisectors intersect.

The ratio of men to women is approximately 0.5555555555555556, which can be simplified to 5/9 when considering the ratio of men to the total number of players (since 5 is to 9 as men are to the total number of players, which includes men and women). Let's denote the number of men as M and the number of women as W. According to the ratio, we have: M / W = 5 / 9 We also know that the total number of players on the team is 14: M + W = 14 Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns. We can solve for M and W. From the first equation, we can express M in terms of W: M = (5 / 9) * W Now we can substitute this expression for M into the second equation: (5 / 9) * W + W = 14 To combine the terms, we need a common denominator, which is 9: (5W + 9W) / 9 = 14 14W / 9 = 14 Now we can solve for W: 14W = 14 * 9 W = (14 * 9) / 14 W = 9 Now that we have the number of women (W = 9), we can find the number of men (M) using the first equation: M = (5 / 9) * W M = (5 / 9) * 9 M = 5 So, there are 5 men and 9 women on the team.

If k = 2^n times 3, then 10^n divided by k gives frac{10^n}{2^n times 3} = frac{5^n}{3}. This quotient cannot further simplify to cancel out with the denominator, ensuring frac{1}{k} maintains exactly n digits after the decimal point. Since k is divisible by 3, and involves the smallest power of 2 to satisfy the condition with n digits, no smaller k can meet both conditions (having exactly n digits after the decimal place and being divisible by 3).

Let's denote this distance as D. 1. In stream A, the man's speed is increased by 16 km/h. Therefore, his speed in stream A is 20 km/h + 16 km/h = 36 km/h. 2.

According to the information given, 75% of the total network engineers at the company came from University A.

So, we can write the equation: [ 0.75 times (20 + x) = text{Number of engineers from University A} ] From the statement \\"0.65 of the original 20 network engineers came from University A,\\" we can infer that this is incorrect because 0.65 is not a percentage and cannot be applied directly to the number of original network engineers.

Shifting the parabola 3 units to the left involves replacing x with (x + 3). This is because, in the coordinate system, moving to the left means decreasing the x-value, but in the equation, we achieve this by adding to x. Thus, the equation becomes y = (x + 3)^2 + 2. 2. Then, shifting the parabola 4 units down means subtracting 4 from the y-value of the parabola. This is done by subtracting 4 from the constant term in the equation obtained from step 1. Therefore, the equation becomes y = (x + 3)^2 + 2 - 4. 3. Simplifying the equation from step 2, we get y = (x + 3)^2 - 2.

According to the problem, 5% of the population died due to bombardment. So, the population after the bombardment is 95% of the initial population, which can be represented as 0.95P. After the bombardment, 15% of the remaining population left the village due to fear. This means that 85% of the population that remained after the bombardment stayed in the village.

Consider the effect of changing a single element ( x_k ) in the sequence. Changing ( x_k ) will affect the values of the quadruples that include ( x_k ). Specifically, it will affect the quadruples ( (x_{k-3}, x_{k-2}, x_{k-1}, x_k) ), ( (x_{k-2}, x_{k-1}, x_k, x_{k+1}) ), ( (x_{k-1}, x_k, x_{k+1}, x_{k+2}) ), and ( (x_k, x_{k+1}, x_{k+2}, x_{k+3}) ). 3.

For example, if the original product of a quadruple was ( P ), after changing ( x_k ), the new product will be ( -P ). 4.

Show that it is possible, using the previous operation, to reach any position from any other position having the same number of marbles.","completion":"1. **Redistribution to a Single Hole**: Let's demonstrate that we can move all the marbles into one single hole (a position we will denote by L). The process is rather straightforward. We select a target hole and proceed to move all the marbles from the other holes into this target hole. We do this by picking marbles from each non-empty hole one by one and placing them into the target hole following the given rule. 2. **Graph Representation**: Now let's define a directed graph G. The vertices of this graph represent all possible configurations of the provided number of marbles across n holes (with a fixed total number of marbles). The edges of the graph represent the allowed moves (distributing marbles from one hole to subsequent holes). 3. **Degree of Vertices**: Notice that in this directed graph, every vertex S (which represents a particular configuration) has an equal number of incoming and outgoing edges. The number of outgoing edges from a vertex S corresponds to the number of non-empty holes in that configuration. Whenever we pick a non-empty hole and distribute its marbles, we reach a new configuration which corresponds to a different vertex in the graph. Similarly, we can think about the reverse movement (collecting marbles that were distributed back into one hole). This reversed process also indicates that the number of incoming edges to a vertex S is equal to the number of non-empty holes in that configuration. Thus, each vertex has the same number of incoming and outgoing edges. 4. **Path Between Two Configurations**: Let A be any vertex in G. Our goal is to show that there is a path from the configuration L (all marbles in one hole) to configuration A. 5. **Path Construction**: To establish this, consider first a path from A to L. Such a path can be chosen to be cycle-free. We then proceed by removing the edges used in this path from G. Starting from the configuration L, we randomly traverse the vertices of the reduced graph (deleting each edge as it is used) until we can no longer continue. The property that the degree of every vertex is balanced (same number of incoming and outgoing edges) ensures that, regardless of our traversal sequence, we must eventually end at vertex A, because we cannot get stuck at any vertex other than A. This observation provides us with a clear path from L to A. 6. **Conclusion**: We conclude that from any configuration with a fixed number of marbles, it is possible to reach any other configuration with the same number of marbles using the given redistribution rule. Hence, it has been demonstrated that any position can be reached from any other position with the same number of marbles. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given condition p: x^22x3<0, and condition q: x>a, if p is a sufficient but not necessary condition for q, then the range of values for a is ( ) A: a>3 B: ageq3 C: a<1 D: aleq1","completion":"From x^2-2x-3<0, we get -1<x<3.

We will analyze what happens to a and b after one round. 2. Suppose the player bets x gold coins and p silver coins on red, and y gold coins and q silver coins on black. 3. Depending on the outcome declared by the dealer: - If red wins, the gold coins increase by x - y (as x gold coins are doubled and y are lost), and similarly, the silver coins increase by p - q. - If black wins, the gold coins decrease by x - y, and the silver coins decrease by p - q. 4. Clearly, |x - y| leq a and |p - q| leq b, and it’s also clear that any values within these ranges can be achieved. 5. Assume a > 3b.

Notice that if a + b is a multiple of 4, then z and r will also be integers, meaning the player can reach the goal in one round. 12. Lastly, we need to show that the player can make a + b a multiple of 4. By betting all coins on red, the player can ensure that either they lose everything (which is an acceptable outcome) or the total number of coins doubles, ensuring a + b becomes a multiple of 4. # Conclusion: The player can ensure that the types of coins differ by exactly a factor of 3 when a + b is a multiple of 4.

Clearly, point ( Q ) is on one of the faces ( ABD ), ( ACD ), or ( BCD ). For clarity, let's assume ( Q ) lies on face ( ABD ). 2. **Construct the Projected Line:** In the plane ( ABD ), draw a line perpendicular to edge ( AB ) through point ( Q ).

To remove the imaginary unit i from the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (1-i): z = frac{1}{1+i} cdot frac{1-i}{1-i}. 4.

There are (2^3 = 8) possible ways to assign each element to the subsets (X), (Y), and (Z) (since each element can either be in or out of each subset). 2. **Excluding the empty assignment:** Out of these 8 possibilities, one possibility is that the element is not in any of the subsets (X), (Y), or (Z).

Consider the nature of the factors: - Each factor ( (x-i) ) where ( i in {1, 2, ldots, 2016} ) is present on both sides. - For each ( i ), the equation ( (x-i) = (x-i) ) admits the real solution ( x = i ). 3. To ensure that the equation has no real solutions: - All factors corresponding to each ( i ) in ( {1, 2, ldots, 2016} ) must be removed from at least one side of the equation. - Removing a factor ( (x-i) ) from either the left or the right side ensures that ( x = i ) is no longer a solution. 4.

Since the eccentricity of the ellipse dfrac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + dfrac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (a > b > 0) is dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we have dfrac{c}{a} = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Thus, a = 2sqrt{2}.

Hence, the number of such binary strings (and thus the valid permutations) is: [ 2^9 = 512 ] 5. **Uniqueness of the Permutations via Code:** We show that each permutation uniquely corresponds to a binary string: - Consider a permutation of numbers (1, 2, ldots, 10).

Next, we calculate the time it takes to cool the candy mixture from T degrees to 170 degrees. Since the candy cools at a rate of 7 degrees per minute, the time to cool it to 170 degrees is (T - 170) / 7 minutes. The total time for both heating and cooling is 46 minutes, so we can set up the following equation: (T - 60) / 5 + (T - 170) / 7 = 46 To solve for T, we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 35.

Since the function 2^x + 1 is increasing, the function frac{2}{2^x + 1} is decreasing (as we are dividing a constant by an increasing function). Therefore, 1 - frac{2}{2^x + 1} is an increasing function because subtracting a decreasing function from 1 results in an increasing function.

First, let's consider the natural numbers from 1 to 100: 1. Composite numbers are numbers that have more than two factors. In the range of 1 to 100, the composite numbers are all numbers except for the prime numbers and 1 (since 1 is neither prime nor composite). There are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97). So, the number of composite numbers is 100 - 25 (primes) - 1 (the number 1) = 74. 2. Complex numbers with a non-zero imaginary part are not among the natural numbers. All natural numbers are real numbers, and complex numbers are not considered when selecting from natural numbers. Therefore, there are no complex numbers with a non-zero imaginary part in the set of the first 100 natural numbers. Since the two conditions (being a composite number and being a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part) are mutually exclusive in the context of the first 100 natural numbers, we don't need to worry about overlap. The probability of selecting a composite number is the number of composite numbers divided by the total number of natural numbers in the range: P(composite) = Number of composite numbers / Total natural numbers P(composite) = 74 / 100 P(composite) = 0.74 or 74% Since there are no complex numbers with a non-zero imaginary part in the set, the probability of selecting such a number is 0%. Therefore, the total probability that a number selected at random from the first 100 natural numbers is either a composite number or a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part is simply the probability of selecting a composite number, which is boxed{74%} ."},{"prompt":"若买10杯A款咖啡, 15杯B款咖啡需230元；若买25杯A型咖啡, 25杯B型咖啡需450元. 问题解决 任务1: 问A款咖啡和B款咖啡的销售单价各是多少元? 任务2: 在不加料的情况下,购买A、B两种款式的咖啡（两种都要）,刚好花200元,问有几种购买方案?","completion":"任务1: 设A款咖啡的销售单价是x元，B款咖啡的销售单价是y元. 根据题意, 我们可以建立方程组: [ left{ begin{array}{l} 10x + 15y = 230 25x + 25y = 450 end{array} right. ] 我们首先化简第二个方程, 两边同时除以25, 得到: [ x + y = 18 ] 接着, 我们解这个方程组. 从第二个方程中减去第一个方程的两倍, 得到: [ 5y = 50 Rightarrow y = 10 ] 将y = 10代入x + y = 18, 得到: [ x = 8 ] 因此, A款咖啡的销售单价是8元，B款咖啡的销售单价是10元. 所以答案是: [ boxed{x = 8, y = 10} ] 任务2: 设购买m杯A款咖啡，n杯B款咖啡, 根据题意得到方程: [ 8m + 10n = 200 ] 化简得: [ 4m + 5n = 100 ] 进一步得到: [ n = 20 - frac{4}{5}m ] 因为m和n都是正整数, 我们可以通过试错法找到所有可能的m和n的值: [ left{ begin{array}{l} m = 5, n = 16 m = 10, n = 12 m = 15, n = 8 m = 20, n = 4 end{array} right. ] 因此, 共有4种购买方案. 所以答案是: [ boxed{4种购买方案} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the two roots of the equation x^{2}7x+12=0 are exactly the lengths of two sides of triangle ABC, find the length of the third side.","completion":"The roots of the equation x^{2}-7x+12=0 are 3 and 4, which are the lengths of two sides of triangle ABC.

In this case, every triangle in the graph must contain at least two vertices from the set ({A, B, C, D}). Suppose there exist two triangles such that their respective pairs of vertices, chosen from ({A, B, C, D}), are disjoint. Without loss of generality, let these triangles be (EAB) and (FCD). These two triangles must share a common vertex, hence (E = F). This implies that (EABCD) is a complete subgraph on 5 vertices, which contradicts the graph being 5-free. Now consider a triangle, which without loss of generality, we can denote as (EAB). From the previous analysis, any other triangle must contain either (A) or (B).

Specifically, it changes the orientation (clockwise or counter-clockwise arrangement) of the triangle formed by the pucks. 4. To consider if the pucks can return to their initial positions after a sequence of moves, we need to analyze the effect of an odd or even number of hits on the orientation of ( Delta ABC ). 5. Let's examine the effect of the hits on the pucks: - A single hit changes the orientation of ( Delta ABC ) (i.e., if it was clockwise, it becomes counter-clockwise, or vice versa). - After an even number of hits, the triangle's orientation will return to its initial state (since the effect of each pair of hits cancels out). - After an odd number of hits, the triangle's orientation will be opposite to its initial state. 6. In this problem, we are asked if it is possible for all pucks to return to their original positions after exactly 25 hits. 7. Notice that 25 is an odd number. Hence, after 25 hits, the orientation of ( Delta ABC ) will be opposite to its initial orientation.

Prove that among some ten consecutive boots, there are equal numbers of left and right boots.","completion":"1. **Define Variables** Let ( L_i ) represent the number of left boots among the ( i )-th to ((i+9))-th boots. Thus, ( L_i ) denotes the count of left boots within any segment of 10 consecutive boots starting from the ( i )-th position. 2. **Sum of Left Boots** Since there are 30 boots in total, with 15 left and 15 right boots, we have three disjoint segments of 10 boots each adding up to cover all 30 boots: [ L_1 + L_{11} + L_{21} = 15 ] 3. **Case Analysis** We need to see if among ( L_1, L_{11}, ) and ( L_{21} ), there is any number that equals 5. Let’s consider two cases: - **Case 1: One of ( L_1, L_{11}, ) or ( L_{21} ) equals 5** If any of these equals 5, then we have found a segment of 10 boots with exactly 5 left and 5 right boots. This is our required segment. - **Case 2: None of ( L_1, L_{11}, ) or ( L_{21} ) equals 5** Suppose none of ( L_1, L_{11}, ) or ( L_{21} ) equals 5, then each of these values must either be greater than 5 or less than 5, since they sum to 15 (an odd number). Therefore, one of them must be greater than 5, and another must be less than 5, given their sum is precisely 15. - Without loss of generality, assume ( L_1 > 5 ) and ( L_{11} < 5 ). This can be extended to any pair. 4. **Transition between Consecutive Positions** Notice that ( L_{i+1} ), the number of left boots in the next segment of 10 boots starting from position ( i+1 ), can only differ from ( L_i ) by at most 1. This is because we only move the starting point by one position, which removes one boot from the previous set and includes the next boot. Therefore, [ |L_{i+1} - L_i| leq 1 ] 5. **Intermediate Conclusion** Considering the transition: - If ( L_1 > 5 ) and ( L_{2} ) can only be ( L_1, L_1-1, ) or ( L_1+1 ). - The same logic applies to ( L_{10} ) and ( L_{11} ). - We will have to cross the value 5 upon moving from a segment where the left boots exceed 5 to one where they fall below 5, given that values cannot jump by more than 1. 6. **Exact Matching Segment** Thus, at some ( k ) (where ( 1 leq k leq 21 )), we will find that: [ L_k = 5 ] This is the required segment where there are exactly 5 left boots and 5 right boots amongst 10 consecutive boots. # Conclusion: Hence, there exists at least one segment of 10 consecutive boots in which the number of left boots equals the number of right boots.

This means we can focus on finding the number of sequences that can be arranged in ascending order and then double that number to account for the descending order arrangements. 2. **Calculate Ascending Order Arrangements**: - If we select any one of the six numbers (1 through 6), there are five other positions where this number can be placed. This gives us a total of 6 times 5 = 30 possible arrangements. - However, this calculation includes some overcounting. For example, the arrangement 132456 is counted twice: once when we consider removing 3 and once when we consider removing 2. This overcounting occurs for any sequence where two adjacent numbers are swapped. - To correct for this overcounting, we subtract the number of these specific overcounted cases. There are 5 such cases: 213456, 132456, 124356, 123546, and 123465. This leads us to adjust our total by subtracting these 5 cases from the initial 30, resulting in 30 - 5 = 25. 3. **Adjust for the Base Case**: We realize that in our subtraction, we also removed the base case of 123456, which should be included exactly once. Therefore, we add 1 back to our total, giving us 25 + 1 = 26 valid ascending order arrangements. 4. **Account for Descending Order Arrangements**: Since each ascending order arrangement has a corresponding descending order arrangement, we multiply our total by 2 to include these cases.

Combined rate = (214 sinks / (210 * 214) seconds) + (210 sinks / (210 * 214) seconds) Combined rate = (214 + 210) sinks / (210 * 214) seconds Combined rate = 424 sinks / (210 * 214) seconds Now, to find the time it takes to fill one sink when both taps are working together, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate: Time to fill one sink = 1 / Combined rate Time to fill one sink = (210 * 214) seconds / 424 sinks Now we calculate the time: Time to fill one sink = (210 * 214) / 424 Time to fill one sink = 44820 / 424 Time to fill one sink ≈ 105.7 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately 105.7 seconds to fill the sink when both taps are working together at their maximum constant rates.

The (arcsin) function has a range ([- frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}]), and when combined with (sin x), it will repetitively take every value in this interval. The sum of a linear function and a periodic function creates a function that is periodic but with a linearly increasing tendency. 3. **Behavior of the Function**: Given the linear function's slope and the period of (arcsin(sin x)), the combination will hit each y-value exactly three times in each period due to the linear term dominating the general trend with a repetitive fluctuation due to the (arcsin(sin x)) term. 4. **Constructing Another Example**: Another function example that fits this requirement is: [ f(x) = operatorname{frac}left(frac{2x}{3pi}right) + sin x ] - Here, (operatorname{frac}(y)) represents the fractional part of (y), which ranges from 0 to 1. - The term (frac{2x}{3pi}) will linearly increase, and its fractional part will repeat every (3pi/2). - The (sin x) term fluctuates between (-1) and (1), acting as a smooth periodic function.

Since theta is an acute angle, 0 leq sintheta leq 1, we can find the minimum value of (sintheta + frac{1}{2})^2 is frac{1}{4} when sintheta = 0, and hence: d > sqrt{frac{1}{4} + 4} = sqrt{frac{17}{4}} > sqrt{4} = 2.

Consider we place the cubes on the table in an arbitrary manner. Let a be the number of black faces visible and b be the number of white faces visible initially. 2. Our goal is to show that we can adjust the cubes so that the number of black and white faces visible is equal. Mathematically, we want to show that we can make a - b = 0. 3. We need to prove that it's possible to rotate the cubes such that the difference a - b changes by 2 or remains the same with each rotation. 4. Let's analyze the effect of rotating a single cube: - Each cube has 6 faces, and 1 face is always on the table, leaving 5 visible faces. - As there are 20 cubes, initially there are 5 times 20 = 100 faces visible in total. 5. To adjust the difference a - b, consider rotating a cube: - If the cube is rotated, two faces will exchange places. - Specifically, the face that was visible but is now on the table and the face that was on the table but is now visible will switch. - Depending on the colors of these faces, this rotation changes the number of visible black and white faces by 0 or 2. 6. We will employ the continuous change assurance technique: - Define the function f(theta) indicating the number of visible black faces minus the number of visible white faces after rotating cubes by an angle theta. - Initially, f(0) = a - b, where a and b are the number of visible black and white faces, respectively. 7. By small, continuous adjustments (theta) in cube rotations: - Either f(theta) is constant (i.e., difference a - b does not change) or it changes by 2. - As the total difference can potentially be adjusted in increments of 2, continuing these small, controlled rotations can theoretically achieve any a - b within the constraints. 8. Therefore: - By adjusting rotations, we can continue until we either make the function f(theta) approach closer to zero. - Since a - b initially does not exceed the total number of visible faces (100), continuous rotations will encounter an intermediate state where a - b = 0 as it crosses zero at some point. Conclusion: Using cube rotations, we can achieve a configuration where the number of visible black faces equals the number of visible white faces.

Since any fraction with 1 in the numerator cannot be simplified further, it follows that the original fraction (frac{21n + 4}{14n + 3}) cannot be simplified either. (blacksquare) II. Proof by Contradiction: 1. **Assuming Simplification:** Assume that the fraction (frac{21n + 4}{14n + 3}) can be simplified. This implies that there exists some integer (d > 1) such that both the numerator and denominator have (d) as a common divisor. 2. **Setting Up Equations:** We can write: [ 21n + 4 = K_1 d ] [ 14n + 3 = K_2 d ] for some positive integers (K_1) and (K_2). 3. **Eliminate the Common Factor:** Subtract twice the first equation from three times the second equation: [ 3(14n + 3) - 2(21n + 4) = 3K_2 d - 2K_1 d ] Simplifying the left-hand side: [ 42n + 9 - 42n - 8 = K_2 d = 2K_1 d ] This simplifies as: [ 1 = d(3K_2 - 2K_1) ] 4. **Implications of the Equation:** Since (d) is a common divisor, the equation (1 = d(3K_2 - 2K_1)) implies that (d) must be 1 or -1. As (d) is a positive integer greater than 1 by assumption and we arrive at a contradiction, (d = 1). 5. **Conclusion:** Since no common divisor (d) greater than 1 exists, the fraction (frac{21n + 4}{14n + 3}) is in its simplest form and cannot be simplified.

Additionally, y can be expressed as f(z) for some z, showing f is injective. Hence, f is bijective. 2. **Find an antecedent a of 0 such that f(a) = 0:** Since f is bijective, there exists some a such that f(a) = 0.

The curve y=f(x) at point (2, f(2)) is perpendicular to the line y=-x+1, thus the slope of the tangent line must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of y=-x+1, which is 1. The condition for perpendicularly is f'(2) = 1, so 2 - a - 1 + frac{a}{2} = 1 Solving for a gives a = 0. Therefore, the function simplifies to f(x) = frac{1}{2}x^2 - x and f(2) = 0.

First, we calculate the time taken to travel from x to y uphill: Time uphill = Distance / Speed = D / 60 hours Next, we calculate the time taken to travel from y to x downhill: Time downhill = Distance / Speed = D / 36 hours Now, we find the total time taken for the round trip by adding the time uphill and the time downhill: Total time = Time uphill + Time downhill Total time = (D / 60) + (D / 36) To find the average speed for the entire journey, we use the formula: Average speed = Total distance / Total time The total distance for the round trip is 2D (D for the trip from x to y and D for the return trip from y to x). Now we plug in the values: Average speed = 2D / [(D / 60) + (D / 36)] To simplify the equation, we find a common denominator for the fractions in the denominator, which is 60 * 36.

Let (s) be the length of one side. [ 4s = 100 implies s = frac{100}{4} = 25 , text{cm} ] 2. **Express the diagonals in terms of their halves:** Let (d_1) and (d_2) be the lengths of the diagonals. Since the sum of the diagonals is given as (62 , text{cm}), we have: [ d_1 + d_2 = 62 , text{cm} ] 3. **Use the relationship between the side length and the diagonals:** In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

Prove that the permutation ( pi ) contains a single cycle.","completion":"To demonstrate that the permutation pi defined by Ariane's process on an arbitrary tree with n vertices results in a single cycle, we proceed using strong induction on n. 1. **Base Case:** - For ( n = 1 ), there is only one vertex and no edges. The permutation pi is trivially the identity permutation, which forms a single cycle. Thus, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume the statement is true for all trees with fewer than n vertices, where ( n geq 2 ). - Consider a tree A with n vertices. Let e be the last edge considered by Ariane during her process. 3. **Formation of Subtrees:** - When the edge e is removed from the tree A, it splits A into two subtrees B and C, with k and n - k vertices respectively, where 1 leq k leq n-1. - Let E_B be the set of vertex numbers in subtree B, and E_C be the set of vertex numbers in subtree C. 4. **Inductive Hypothesis Application:** - By the inductive hypothesis, since k < n and n - k < n, the permutations of vertex numbers within B and C just before considering the last edge e are each single cycles due to the n-2 operations already performed. - Therefore, just before e is considered, B vertices form a cycle and C vertices form another cycle. Let these cycles be represented as follows: - In subtree B, let the cycle be ( b_1 rightarrow b_2 rightarrow cdots rightarrow b_k rightarrow b_1 ). - In subtree C\`, let the cycle be ( c_1 rightarrow c_2 rightarrow cdots rightarrow c_{n-k} rightarrow c_1 ). 5. **Consideration of Edge ( e ):** - Let the endpoints of the edge e be initially numbered c_1 and c_2. - When Ariane considers the edge e and swaps the numbers of its endpoints, the permutation of the entire set of vertices is modified to link the cycles of B and C into a single cycle. 6. **Resulting Single Cycle:** - After the swap involving e, the permutation pi of all vertices becomes: [ b_1 rightarrow c_2 rightarrow c_3 rightarrow cdots rightarrow c_{n-k} rightarrow c_1 rightarrow b_2 rightarrow b_3 rightarrow cdots rightarrow b_k rightarrow b_1 ] This sequence represents a single cycle, incorporating all vertices from both B and C. 7. **Conclusion:** - By the principle of strong induction, the resulting permutation pi contains exactly one cycle for any integer n geq 1 when Ariane completes her process on a tree.

It's given that (5 + 2 + 5 > 8), so such a trapezoid can indeed exist. 2. **Calculate the Perpendicular Projection:** The perpendicular projection of one leg onto the longer base is (frac{8 - 2}{2} = 3) units long. 3. **Determine the Height of the Trapezoid:** To find the other leg of the right triangle which represents the height of the trapezoid, we use the Pythagorean theorem: [ h = sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = sqrt{25 - 9} = sqrt{16} = 4 text{ units} ] 4. **Calculate the Area:** The area (T) of the trapezoid can be calculated using the formula for the area of a trapezoid: [ T = frac{1}{2} times (8 + 2) times 4 = 20 text{ square units} ] 5. **Square of the Area:** [ T^2 = 20^2 = 400 ] 6. **Product of the Sides:** The product of the sides is: [ 2 times 5 times 8 times 5 = 400 ] 7. **Conclusion:** Since the square of the area equals the product of the sides, but the trapezoid does not have any right angles, our counterexample proves the original statement is false.

Therefore, neither case necessitates the quadrilateral having right angles. 8. **Conclusion:** Counterexamples and general cases show that the statement is not necessarily true.

Method 1: Combinatorial Counting Consider the problem of selecting a group of k students from a class of n students, where one student will be chosen as a leader. 1. **Counting Method 1:** - First, choose a group of k students from n students: binom{n}{k} - Then choose a leader from the k students: k - The total number of ways to do this is: k binom{n}{k} 2. **Counting Method 2:** - First, choose a leader from the n students: n - Then choose the remaining k-1 students from the n-1 remaining students: binom{n-1}{k-1} - The total number of ways to do this is: n binom{n-1}{k-1} By double counting, these two approaches must be equal: k binom{n}{k} = n binom{n-1}{k-1} Method 2: Using the Binomial Theorem The binomial theorem states: (1 + X)^n = sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} X^k 1. Differentiate both sides with respect to X: n(1 + X)^{n-1} = sum_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} k X^{k-1} 2. Substitute X = 1: n(2)^{n-1} = sum_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} k (1)^{k-1} 3. Recognize that: n sum_{j=0}^{n-1} binom{n-1}{j} (1)^j = sum_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} k(1)^{k-1} 4. By matching indices: n sum_{k-1} binom{n-1}{k-1} = sum_{k=1}^n binom{n}{k} k Thus, by equating coefficients, we get: k binom{n}{k} = n binom{n-1}{k-1} Method 3: Inductive Proof To ensure rigor, we will use the principle of mathematical induction. 1. **Initial Case n=1**: - For k=1: 1 binom{1}{1} = 1 = 1 binom{0}{0} - For k > 1, the binomial coefficient binom{1}{k} = 0 and binom{0}{k-1} = 0. Therefore, mathcal{P}_1 is true. 2. **Induction Step**: - Assume mathcal{P}_n is true: kbinom{n}{k} = nbinom{n-1}{k-1} - We need to show mathcal{P}_{n+1}. For k=1: 1 binom{n+1}{1} = n+1 = (n+1) binom{n}{0} For k geq 2, using Pascal's identity: binom{n+1}{k} = binom{n}{k-1} + binom{n}{k} Multiply both sides by k: k binom{n+1}{k} = k binom{n}{k-1} + k binom{n}{k} By the inductive hypothesis: k binom{n+1}{k} = (k-1) binom{n}{k-1} + binom{n}{k-1} + n binom{n-1}{k-1} Apply Pascal's identity again within the expression: k binom{n+1}{k} = n left( binom{n-1}{k-2} + binom{n-1}{k-1} right) + binom{n}{k-1} + binom{n}{k-1} Which reduces to: k binom{n+1}{k} = (n+1) binom{n}{k-1} Thus, mathcal{P}_{n+1} holds, and by induction, for all n, mathcal{P}_n holds, i.e., for all k and n: kbinom{n}{k} = nbinom{n-1}{k-1} Conclusion: boxed{kbinom{n}{k} = nbinom{n-1}{k-1}}"},{"prompt":"What is the maximum number of solid 3text{in} times 1text{in} times 2text{in} blocks that can fit in a 4text{in} times 3text{in} times 6text{in} box? textbf{(A)} 6qquadtextbf{(B)} 8qquadtextbf{(C)} 10qquadtextbf{(D)} 12qquadtextbf{(E)} 14","completion":"1. **Calculate the new volumes**: - Volume of the larger box: [ V_{text{box}} = 4 text{ in} times 3 text{ in} times 6 text{ in} = 72 text{ in}^3 ] - Volume of one smaller block: [ V_{text{block}} = 3 text{ in} times 1 text{ in} times 2 text{ in} = 6 text{ in}^3 ] 2. **Determine the number of smaller blocks that fit based on volume**: - Using the volume approach: [ text{Number of blocks} = frac{V_{text{box}}}{V_{text{block}}} = frac{72 text{ in}^3}{6 text{ in}^3} = 12 ] 3. **Check physical arrangement of blocks**: - Arrange the blocks within the dimensions of the box: - The longer side of the block (3 in) can be aligned with the 6 in side of the box, fitting two blocks side by side. - The narrower side of the block (1 in) alongside the 3 in width of the box, fitting all three blocks neatly without space left. - The other dimension (2 in) of the block together with the 4 in height of the box, allowing two layers of blocks. - Calculate total fit: [ 2 text{ blocks along length} times 3 text{ blocks along width} times 2 text{ layers} = 12 text{ blocks} ] **Conclusion**: It is feasible to arrange 12 blocks into the box without violating any of the box's dimensional constraints.

Knowing that the parity (even or odd nature) of any number is different from the parity of its immediate neighbors helps us to analyze the problem better. 2. **Evaluating Parity Conditions:** We first demonstrate that in any block of four consecutive numbers, there are exactly two even numbers and two odd numbers. Let's consider any arbitrary block of four numbers. If it were not the case, implying there are three numbers of the same parity (either all even or all odd), we run into a contradiction since: - Suppose there are three odd numbers in the block, say positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are filled as (OOOE) (O stands for odd and E stands for even). Then the 4th number must be even. - The 2nd odd number would have both neighbors as odd, violating the given condition (since neighbors must be of different parity). Thus, there cannot be three numbers with the same parity in any block of four consecutive numbers. 3. **Parity Distribution Over the Entire Range:** Let's break the range from 2 to 2021 into blocks of four numbers.

Checking small values of b: - For b = 2: b^2 + 1 = 5 (square-free) - For b = 3: b^2 + 1 = 10 (square-free) - For b = 4: b^2 + 1 = 17 (square-free) - For b = 5: b^2 + 1 = 26 (square-free) - For b = 6: b^2 + 1 = 37 (square-free) - For b = 7: b^2 + 1 = 50 = 2 times 5^2 (not square-free) Therefore, the smallest b such that b^2 + 1 is not square-free is b = 7.

Thus, every element ( a in S ) must appear in at least 7 different subsets ( A_i ). 5. **Minimum Number Calculation**: - Given ( S ) has 15 elements, and each element must be in at least seven different subsets.

In this plane, construct an equilateral triangle with a height of 2 units. Denote this triangle as XYZ. Let J be the center of one of the excircles of triangle XYZ, and A, B, and C be the midpoints of the sides of the triangle. 2. **Positioning the Spheres:** - Place three spheres in such a way that their centers are located at points A, B, and C. Let these spheres each have a radius of 1 unit. - Place two additional spheres with a greater radius of 2 units. Let the centers of these spheres be at points J' and J'', which are obtained by vertically shifting the center J by 1 unit up and 1 unit down relative to the plane alpha. Here, J' is J raised by 1 unit and J'' is J lowered by 1 unit vertically. 3. **Tangent Plane Verification:** - To determine that we can draw a tangent plane for each sphere through its center tangent to the remaining four spheres, consider a plane passing through point A. This plane would be perpendicular to alpha and would also contain the side of the equilateral triangle on which A lies. - Check each sphere individually: - For spheres centered at A, B, and C: Construct a vertical plane through each point. This plane can be perpendicular to the horizontal plane alpha and can contain one side of the triangle XYZ. - For the sphere centered at J': - Check the tangent plane through the center of the sphere at J'. Since J' was 1 unit vertically shifted up from J, a horizontal tangent plane can pass through J' and be tangent to the other four spheres (at A, B, C, and J''). - For the sphere centered at J'': - Perform a similar check as for J'. Since J'' is 1 unit vertically shifted down from J, a horizontal tangent plane can pass through J'' and be tangent to the other four spheres (at A, B, C, and J'). 4. **Conclusion:** After placing spheres as described and verifying the existence of tangent planes, one can indeed arrange five spheres in such a manner.

We need to identify the minimum number of non-equal length edges in such a tetrahedron. 2. **Analyzing the Constraints:** - Given that no face is an isosceles triangle, each face must be a scalene triangle. This implies that all three sides of each triangular face must be of different lengths. - We need to find the minimum number of edges in the tetrahedron that have non-equal lengths. 3. **Configuration and Parity Check:** - A tetrahedron has 4 faces and 6 edges. - For each face not being an isosceles triangle, at least three edges should be different in length, but this can overlap among faces. 4. **Consideration of Minimal Unequal Edges:** - If each face must have edges of unequal length and we are to minimize the number of unequal lengths, we could consider sharing edges among faces. - Starting with minimum, if at least 3 edges need to be non-equal, this configuration could suffice to ensure no isosceles triangles among all faces: Suppose edges (a), (b), and (c) are of different lengths and they form a single face. The other edges can be made non-equal while connected to this configuration without further demanding more unequal segments. 5. **Proof/Verification:** - Label the vertices of the tetrahedron as (A, B, C, D). - Assume (AB = a), (BC = b), (CA = c), such that (a neq b neq c). - The remaining connections are formed with (D): (DA, DB, DC). - Each of (DA, DB, DC) can potentially continue ensuring the faces (ADB), (BDC), and (CDA) remain scalene while also using the same edges among faces causing no further need for more unequal segments.

To minimize this cost, we use the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means, which states that the arithmetic mean of a list of non-negative real numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same list: frac{1}{2}x+frac{45000}{x}-200 geq 2sqrt{frac{1}{2}x cdot frac{45000}{x}}-200 = 100.

The key here is that by choosing an optimal 18 times 18 square, the first player divides the remaining parts of the rectangle into two identical sections along the axis of symmetry. - For visual reference, imagine a 19 times 94 rectangular board separated by an 18 times 18 square aligned such that its symmetry matches the symmetry of the whole rectangle. 3. **Symmetry Principle in Gameplay**: Following this initial symmetric division, the first player can consistently respond to each move of the second player with a symmetric move relative to the axis of symmetry of the initial 18 times 18 square. 4. **Ensuring a Move Always Exists**: Whenever the second player makes a move marking a square in one of the two identical regions created by the above step, the first player can always respond by marking an identically shaped and positioned square in the other region. This strategy is backed by the fact that the second player cannot place a square that intersects the symmetry axis, as it would be prohibited by the game rules of consecutive marking. 5. **Inevitable Win**: By adhering to the symmetry strategy, the first player ensures that they will always have a valid symmetric move in response to the second player. This leaves the second player with no choice but to lose because eventually, they will run out of available moves while the first player makes the last marking move to win the game. # Conclusion: By following the above strategy of selecting the initial 18 times 18 square and maintaining symmetric moves, the first player guarantees they will paint the last cell and win.

The possible remainders are ({0, 1, 2, ldots, 2n-1}). 2. **Sum of Distinct Remainders:** Let’s denote the resulting sums by ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{2n} ).

We know that there are a total of 20 boxes, so: ( x + y = 20 ) (Equation 1) We are also told that removing 15 of the 20-pound boxes will reduce the average weight of the boxes to 12 pounds. This means that after removing 15 of the 20-pound boxes, the total weight of the remaining boxes divided by the number of remaining boxes (which is 20 - 15 = 5) will be 12 pounds. So, the total weight of the remaining boxes is ( 5 times 12 = 60 ) pounds. Since we are removing 15 of the 20-pound boxes, there will be ( y - 15 ) of the 20-pound boxes left. But since the average weight after removing these boxes is 12 pounds, and we know that the 10-pound boxes are still there, all the remaining boxes must be 10-pound boxes. This means that ( y - 15 = 0 ), so ( y = 15 ). Now we know there are 15 boxes that weigh 20 pounds each.

How long is the train?","completion":"To find the length of the train, we need to calculate the total distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge. This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. First, we convert the speed of the train from km/h to m/s because the length of the bridge is given in meters and the time is given in seconds. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 54 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 54 * (1000 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 54 * (5 / 18) Speed in m/s = 15 m/s Now, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while crossing the bridge using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken to cross the bridge is given as 55.99552035837134 seconds.

Since (frac{1978}{6} > 329), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one country that contains at least 330 members. Let's denote this country as country (A) with the largest member number (m_1). 3. **Difference Operation**: Subtract the number (m_1) from the numbers of the other members in country (A). We get at least 329 differences, all of which, by assumption, are not the numbers of any members from country (A). Therefore, these differences must be the numbers of members from the remaining five countries. 4. **Further Application of Pigeonhole Principle**: Since (frac{329}{5} > 65), there must be at least one country among the other five, call it (B), that contains at least 66 of these difference values. Let's denote the largest number from this group as (m_2). 5. **Further Difference Operation**: Subtract the number (m_2) from the numbers of the other members in country (B). We get at least 65 differences, all of which, by assumption, are not the numbers of any member from country (B) or country (A). Therefore, these differences must be the numbers of members from the remaining four countries. 6. **Continuing the Process**: The process continues such that for the next iteration: [ frac{65}{4} > 16 ] Then there exists another country, call it (C), that has at least 17 members. 7. **Repeat the Difference Operation**: Subtract the largest number in country (C) from the numbers of its other members. We get at least 16 differences. These differences, by assumption, do not belong to any members from countries (A), (B), and (C), so they must belong to the remaining three countries. 8. **Continuing Reduction**: Continuing in the same manner, eventually, we encounter a situation where: [ frac{remaining_members}{remaining_countries} < 1 ] This results in a scenario where we must assign more differences than the remaining countries have members to provide, leading to a contradiction. **Conclusion**: Given these steps, we arrive at a situation where the assumptions lead to an impossible scenario.

We can approach the solution by breaking it down into steps: **Step 1: Select individuals for task A** Since task A requires 2 people, we need to choose 2 individuals from the 10 available. This can be done in binom{10}{2} ways. binom{10}{2} = frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = frac{10 times 9}{2 times 1} = 45 ways **Step 2: Select individuals for tasks B and C** After allocating 2 individuals to task A, we have 8 individuals remaining. We need to select one individual for task B and one for task C. Since the selection is distinct, this is equivalent to arranging 2 people in 2 positions, which is 2!. However, since the individuals are selected from a pool, we also need to choose 2 individuals out of the remaining 8, which can be done in binom{8}{2} ways. First, we choose the individuals: binom{8}{2} = 28 ways Next, we arrange them: 2! = 2 ways Therefore, the total number of ways to select individuals for tasks B and C is 28 times 2 = 56 ways. **Step 3: Combine the results** To find the total number of different selections, we need to multiply the number of ways to select individuals for task A with the number of ways to select individuals for tasks B and C.

Line AB intersects with the ellipse frac{y^2}{9} + x^2 = 1 at points A and B. Let's denote the coordinates of these points as A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2).

For our parabola, a=-3 and b=-12, so the axis of symmetry is: [ x = -frac{-12}{2 cdot (-3)} = -frac{-12}{-6} = 2 ] This simplifies to x = -2. 2. **Direction of Opening**: Since the coefficient of x^2 (which is -3) is negative, the parabola opens downwards. 3. **Position of Points Relative to the Axis of Symmetry**: The axis of symmetry is at x=-2. We have three points: (-3,y_{1}), (-2,y_{2}), and (1,y_{3}). The point (-3,y_{1}) is to the left of the axis of symmetry, (-2,y_{2}) is on the axis, and (1,y_{3}) is to the right. 4. **Symmetry and Y-Values**: Since the parabola is symmetric about x=-2, and the parabola opens downwards, as x increases from values less than -2 (moving rightward), the y values first increase until the axis of symmetry and then decrease. Therefore, for x < -2, y increases as x increases. This means that as we move from x=-3 to x=-2, y increases, so y_{1} < y_{2}. 5. **Symmetric Points**: The point (1,y_{3}) is symmetric to a point on the left side of the axis of symmetry. This symmetric point would have an x-value of -5 (since it's equally distant from the axis as 1 but on the opposite side). Since -5 < -3 < -2, and we know the parabola opens downwards, it follows that y_{2} > y_{1}. Also, since y values decrease as we move past the axis of symmetry (from left to right), y_{3} is less than y_{1} and y_{2}. 6. **Conclusion**: Combining these observations, we find that y_{2} is the greatest because it's on the axis of symmetry where the parabola reaches its maximum (since it opens downwards), followed by y_{1} which is to the left of the axis, and y_{3} which is to the right and thus the smallest.

However, this does not make the solution set mathbb{R}, so we focus on the case when a neq 0. 2. **When a neq 0:** For the entire real line to be a solution, the quadratic must always be less than or equal to zero.

Assume this line to be horizontal. - Any unit triangle will lie on only one side of ( ell ), either above or below. - Consider two black unit triangles, one with one side lying on this line ( ell ), and the other, the reflected version along the same line ( ell ). Call such a pair *nice* and a configuration having nice pairs only, as a *nice configuration*. 3. **Nice Configurations for Even ( n )**: - Since ( n ) is even, consider nice configurations. - We want to show that we can't find an equilateral triangle ( mathcal{S} ) satisfying the given properties. - Let ( p ) and ( q ) be the properties of lines which are ( 60^circ ) and ( 120^circ ) anti-clockwise rotated from ( ell ), and let ( mathbb{P} ) and ( mathbb{Q} ) be their respective sets of such lines. - Select a line ( t ) from either ( mathbb{P} ) or ( mathbb{Q} ). Define *right shifting* or *left shifting* for ( t ) as moving it 1 step forward or backward respectively. - It suffices to show that there will always be ( >1 ) black triangle on either side of ( t ). Otherwise, we could choose a large enough triangle ( mathcal{S} ) covering all but this alone triangle, where one side of ( mathcal{S} ) will lie on ( t ). 4. **Shifting Algorithm**: - Take ( t ) from either the left side of the leftmost pair or the right side of the rightmost pair and begin shifting it right or left according to the need. - For ( t ) from the left side of the leftmost pair, shifting it right will always increase/decrease an even number of black triangles on either side of ( t ) due to our construction. - If we take 2 vertices of ( mathcal{S} ) on ( t ) and the third one on either side of ( t ), we will always miss an even number of black triangles on one side of ( t ) and outside of ( mathcal{S} ), forcing ( n ) to be *ngood*. - For ( t ) from the right side of the rightmost pair, the same argument works, forcing ( n ) to be *ngood*. 5. **Conclusion for Even ( n )**: - This works for ( n ge 4 ) (and even, obviously, due to assumption) because of the shifting algorithm. 6. **Claim**: For ( n ge 5 ) and odd, ( n ) is ngood. - **Proof**: - Place ( frac{n-1}{2} ) unit black triangles described earlier both above and below ( ell ), and place 1 extra unit black triangle either above or below ( ell ) and somewhere between those ( frac{n-1}{2} ) unit black triangles recently chosen. Call this extra unit black triangle *special*. - There exists at least one nice pair on either side of this due to ( n ge 5 ). - Applying the shifting algorithm, we will face no problem until we reach the special triangle from either side. Even then, we will have ( ge 2 ) black triangles on either side, contrary to what we want, that is, one unit black triangle on one side. 7. **Conclusion for Odd ( n )**: - We just need to check ( n le 3 ). 8. **Check for Small ( n )**: - For ( n = 1 ), it is trivially true. - For ( n = 2 ), we could choose one of the two unit black triangles, hence true. - For ( n = 3 ): - Let ( r ) be any line in any of ( mathbb{P}, mathbb{Q}, mathbb{R} ). Here ( mathbb{R} ) is the set of all horizontal lines. - Let ( r' ) be any other line in the same set. Call the two lines ( {r, r'} ), along with the space between them, a *slide* if ( r ) and ( r' ) are consecutive. - If all 3 unit triangles belong to different slides, the choice of ( mathcal{S} ) is obvious. - If 2 of the 3 triangles are in the same slide, choose ( mathcal{S} ) such that it contains those 2 triangles and its third vertex lies on the opposite side of the third triangle with respect to the slide containing 2 triangles. - If all 3 unit black triangles lie in the same slide, choose ( mathcal{S} ) such that it covers either the first and second but not the third, or the second and third but not the first, exhausting all cases. 9. **Final Conclusion**: - The solution works for ( n = 1, 2, 3 ) only.

Nine llamas had 1 calf each, so that's 9 calves. Five llamas had twins, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 calves. In total, there were 9 + 10 = 19 calves born. Now, Jill traded 8 of these calves for 2 new adult llamas. So, she lost 8 calves but gained 2 adults. Before the trade, Jill had her original herd of adult llamas plus the 19 new calves. We don't know the number of her original herd, so let's call that number X. After the trade, Jill had X + 19 - 8 = X + 11 llamas (since she traded 8 calves away and gained 2 adults). Now, Jill has a total of 18 llamas after selling some at the market. This means she sold some llamas to go from X + 11 to 18. So, X + 11 = 18 X = 18 - 11 X = 7 Jill originally had 7 adult llamas before the births. After the births and before any were sold or traded, she had 7 adults + 19 calves = 26 llamas. After the trade, she had 7 adults + 11 calves = 18 llamas. Since she now has 18 llamas and she had 26 before selling any, she must have sold 26 - 18 = 8 llamas. To find the fraction of her herd that Jill sold at the market, we take the number of llamas sold and divide it by the total number of llamas she had before selling: 8 sold / 26 total = 8/26 This fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: 8/26 ÷ 2/2 = 4/13 So, Jill sold boxed{4/13} of her herd at the market."},{"prompt":"Compute binom{18}{10}.

Therefore, the maximum possible mass for a set containing 17 weights is: [ 17 times 70 = 1190 text{ grams} ] The possible distinct weight combinations for these sets are bounded by this maximum mass limit, which implies there can be at most 1190 different masses in this category. 2. **Category 2: Sets with 18 or 19 weights** The reasoning here is more straightforward.

Initially, she narrated 27 stories per night; then, as she grew tired, she told 14 stories per night for some period, and during the last few nights, she told only one story per night. Could it be that the total number of stories she told the Sultan is a natural power of two?","completion":"Given that Scheherazade narrated stories to the Sultan for 1001 nights, let: - (a) be the number of nights she narrated 27 stories per night, - (b) be the number of nights she narrated 14 stories per night, - (c) be the number of nights she narrated 1 story per night. We are given the equations: 1. (a + b + c = 1001) 2. (27a + 14b + c = 2^k), where (2^k) represents a power of 2. To find out if the total number of stories can be a power of 2, we can substitute (c) from the first equation into the second equation: [ c = 1001 - (a + b) ] So, substituting for (c) in the second equation gives: [ 27a + 14b + (1001 - a - b) = 2^k ] [ 26a + 13b + 1001 = 2^k ] [ 26a + 13b = 2^k - 1001 ] Since (2^k) is a power of 2, it is always even. However, 1001 is an odd number: - Therefore, (2^k - 1001) is odd because the difference of an even number and an odd number is odd. Next, notice that (26a + 13b) is also odd. This is because: - (26a) is even (since 26 is an even number multiplied by any integer (a)), - (13b) is always odd (since 13 is an odd number multiplied by any integer (b)). The sum of an even number and an odd number is odd, thus (26a + 13b) is odd. However, the expression (2^k - 1001) being odd does not immediately disprove the possibility. The crucial point is divisibility: - (2^k) for (k geq 0) does not have factors other than 2. - The prime factorization of 1001 is (7 times 11 times 13). If we consider: [ 26a + 13b = 2^k - 1001 ] (13b (mod 13) equiv 0 pmod{13} ) [ 26a + 13b = 13(2a + b) ] This means either: [ 2^k - 1001 equiv 0 pmod{13} ] or (2^k equiv 1001 pmod{13} neq 0) However, (2^k) never ends up as a 13- multiple.

Now, to find the ratio of cookies in each bag to the total number of cookies, we take the number of cookies in one bag (14) and divide it by the total number of cookies (28): Ratio = ( frac{14}{28} ) To simplify the ratio, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 14: Ratio = ( frac{14 div 14}{28 div 14} ) Ratio = ( frac{1}{2} ) Therefore, the ratio of cookies in each bag to the total number of cookies is boxed{1:2} ."},{"prompt":"What is 7^{1} + 7^{2} pmod{25}?

Seth bought 3 boxes of oranges at the market. 2. He then bought twice as many boxes at a local farm. So, he bought 2 * 3 = 6 boxes at the farm. 3. In total, Seth initially had 3 (from the market) + 6 (from the farm) = 9 boxes of oranges. 4. He gave 1 box to his mother, leaving him with 9 - 1 = 8 boxes. 5. He decided to donate a quarter of the remaining boxes to charity. A quarter of 8 is 8 / 4 = 2 boxes. So, he donated 2 boxes. 6. After donating, he was left with 8 - 2 = 6 boxes. 7.

Each day, the worm eats 2 fish, so in 14 days, it eats 14 days * 2 fish/day = 28 fish. After two weeks, James adds 8 more fish to the aquarium. So, the number of fish in the aquarium after adding more fish is 60 fish - 28 fish + 8 fish = 40 fish. The worm continues to eat fish for another week before James discovers it.

The increase is: 100 guests (fourth hour) - 75 guests (third hour) = 25 guests increase To find the ratio of this increase to the number of guests in the third hour: 25 guests increase / 75 guests (third hour) = 1/3 So, the ratio of the increase in guests entering the gym in the fourth hour compared to the third hour is boxed{1:3} ."},{"prompt":"f p_1, p_2, ..., p_n are points on the parabola C:y^2=4x, with their xcoordinates being x_1, x_2, ..., x_n respectively, and F is the focus of the parabola C, given that X_1+X_2+cdots+X_N=10, then the sum left|P_1Fright|+left|P_2Fright|+cdots+left|P_NFright|= .","completion":"**Analysis** This question examines the application of the definition of a parabola, which is a medium-level problem.

Step 1: Simplify the exponent with the natural logarithm: e^{ln 2} becomes 2, since the exponential function and the natural logarithm are inverse functions. Step 2: The term lg^2 2 is simply the square of lg 2. Since lg 2 is 1, squaring it gives us 1. Step 3: The term lg 2 lg 5 exploits the logarithmic property that lg a lg b = lg a + lg b - lg ab. In this case, since lg 2 is 0.3010 and lg 5 is 0.6990, their product is 0.3010 times 0.6990. Step 4: Combining all the terms and simplifying further: begin{align*} e^{ln 2} + lg^2 2 + lg 2 lg 5 + lg 5 &= 2 + 1 + lg 2 cdot lg 5 + lg 5 &= 3 + lg 5 + lg 2 cdot lg 5 &= 3 + lg 5 + (lg 2 + lg 5 - lg (2 times 5)) &= 3 + lg 5 + (lg 2 + lg 5 - lg 10) &= 3 + lg 5 + lg 2 + lg 5 - 1. end{align*} Step 5: Use the fact that lg 10 = 1 and simplify: begin{align*} 3 + lg 2 + lg 5 &= 3 + lg (2 times 5) &= 3 + lg 10 &= 3 + 1 &= 4. end{align*} However, we made a mistake at the beginning: lg 2 is not 1, and so lg^2 2 does not equal 1. We need to correct this to get the right answer. Let's start over the correct way: Step 1: Simplify the exponential term e^{ln 2} to 2. Step 2: Realize that lg^2 2 is actually the square of lg 2 and should remain as it is. Step 3: Use the property that lg a + lg b = lg(ab) to combine the lg 2 and lg 5 terms. Now, let's simplify correctly: begin{align*} e^{ln 2} + lg^2 2 + lg 2 cdot lg 5 + lg 5 &= 2 + lg^2 2 + lg (2 cdot 5) + lg 5 &= 2 + lg^2 2 + lg 10 + lg 5 &= 2 + lg^2 2 + 1 + lg 5 &= 3 + lg^2 2 + lg 5. end{align*} Since lg^2 2 and lg 5 do not combine neatly with the rest, the final simplified expression is: [ boxed{3 + lg^2 2 + lg 5}. ]"},{"prompt":"(Selected Topics on Inequalities) If the solution set of the inequality regarding x, |a1| geq (|2x+1| + |2x3|), is nonempty, then the range of the real number a","completion":"The solution set of the inequality regarding x, |a-1| geq (|2x+1| + |2x-3|), being non-empty is equivalent to |a-1| geq min(|2x+1| + |2x-3|) = 4.

In right triangle OBI (where I is the midpoint of EF), [ OB^2 = OI^2 + BI^2 ] OB = sqrt{2} (radius), OI = sqrt{2} - s/2 (since s/2 is half side length of EFGH), BI = s/2. Substituting, [ 2 = (sqrt{2} - s/2)^2 + (s/2)^2 ] Expanding and simplifying, we find s = sqrt{2/3}. Thus, the area of square EFGH is (sqrt{2/3})^2 = 2/3.

From v, there are 3n edges connecting to 3n other vertices. 5. **Multicolor Triangle Analysis**: If two of the edges connecting a vertex v to other vertices u and w are of different colors, say red and blue, then (v, u, w) forms a multicolor triangle if (u, w) is connected by a yellow edge. Thus, any two edges forming different colors from each vertex contribute to these multicolor triangles. Each vertex contributes binom{3}{2}n^2 = 3frac{n(n-1)}{2}= 3n^2 multicolor triangles. 6. **Total Multicolor Triangles**: The graph has a total of (3n + 1) vertices: [ text{Total multicolor triangles} = 3n^2 (3n + 1) ] 7. **Total Possible Triangles**: The total number of possible triangles (sets of 3 vertices chosen from 3n + 1) is: [ binom{3n+1}{3} = frac{(3n+1)(3n)(3n-1)}{6} ] 8. **Comparison of Triangles**: - Since each triangle can have at most 2 multicolor edges, the number of multicolor edges based on 2 multicolor connections is: [ 2 times binom{3n+1}{3} = 2 times frac{(3n+1)(3n)(3n-1)}{6} ] - Total: [ 3n^2 (3n + 1) quad > quad 2 times frac{(3n+1)(3n)(3n-1)}{6} ] 9. **Conclusion**: Since 3n^2 (3n + 1) is greater than twice binom{3n+1}{3}, there must exist at least one triangle where each of the three edges is a different color, demonstrating that there are three people who each play all three games with each other.

Jack's score is within the top 5% of his class, while also being within 2 standard deviations of the mean. What is the lowest score he could have received?","completion":"To find the lowest score Jack could have received, we need to consider both the top 5% threshold and the \\"within 2 standard deviations of the mean\\" condition. First, let's find the score that represents the top 5% cutoff. In a normal distribution, the top 5% of scores typically fall at or above a z-score of approximately 1.645 (you can find this value in a standard z-score table or by using a statistical calculator). The z-score is calculated using the formula: [ z = frac{(X - mu)}{sigma} ] where ( X ) is the score, ( mu ) is the mean, and ( sigma ) is the standard deviation. Rearranging the formula to solve for ( X ), we get: [ X = z cdot sigma + mu ] Given that the mean ( mu ) is 60 and the standard deviation ( sigma ) is 10, we can calculate the score that corresponds to the z-score of 1.645: [ X = 1.645 cdot 10 + 60 ] [ X = 16.45 + 60 ] [ X = 76.45 ] So, the score that represents the top 5% cutoff is approximately 76.45. Now, let's consider the \\"within 2 standard deviations of the mean\\" condition. Two standard deviations above the mean would be: [ 60 + 2 cdot 10 = 60 + 20 = 80 ] Since Jack's score must be within 2 standard deviations of the mean, the highest score he could have within this range is 80. To find the lowest score Jack could have received while still being in the top 5% and within 2 standard deviations of the mean, we take the lower of the two values we calculated. Since 76.45 is less than 80, the lowest score Jack could have received is approximately 76.45. However, since test scores are typically whole numbers, we would round up to the nearest whole number, which would be 77.

First, note that the condition can be rewritten with c = max(c_1, c_2) + 1, leading to: [ |f(x) + f(y) - f(x+y)| < c ] for all real numbers x, y. This now means there exists some positive c such that the function is bounded by c. We will use this bound condition for the rest of the proof. Without loss of generality, assume that f is monotonically increasing. If we can prove the assertion for a monotonically increasing function, it will also hold for a monotonically decreasing function, since -f also satisfies the given conditions. **Lemma 1**: For all positive integers n and real numbers x, we have: [ |f(nx) - n f(x)| < n c ] **Proof**: We proceed by induction on n. - **Base Case**: For n = 1, the statement is trivially true because |f(x) - f(x)| = 0 < c. - **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some n geq 1. That is: [ |f((n-1)x) - (n-1) f(x)| < (n-1)c ] We need to prove that: [ |f(nx) - n f(x)| < nc ] Using the given condition for f: [ |f(nx) - f((n-1)x) - f(x)| < c ] Then, applying the triangle inequality, we get: [ |f(nx) - n f(x)| = |(f(nx) - f((n-1)x) - f(x)) + (f((n-1)x) - (n-1) f(x))| < c + (n-1)c = nc ] Hence, by induction, the lemma is proven. blacksquare Now, define ( g(x) = frac{f(x)}{x} ) for ( x > 0 ). We will show that ( lim_{x rightarrow infty} g(x) ) exists. **Lemma 2**: If ( q in mathbb{Q}, q geq 1 ), then for ( x > 0 ): [ |g(qx) - g(x)| < frac{2c}{x} ] **Proof**: Let ( q = frac{u}{v} ) where ( u, v ) are positive integers with ( u geq v ). By Lemma 1, we have: [ |f(ux) - u f(x)| < uc quad text{and} quad |f(v cdot (qx)) - v f(qx)| < vc ] From the second inequality, we get: [ |f(ux) - v f(qx)| < vc ] Applying the triangle inequality again: [ |v f(qx) - u f(x)| < (u + v) c leq 2uc ] Dividing by ( ux ): [ left| frac{v}{u} cdot frac{f(qx)}{x} - frac{f(x)}{x} right| < frac{2c}{x} Rightarrow |g(qx) - g(x)| < frac{2c}{x} ] This establishes the lemma. blacksquare Next, consider the sequence ( {g(n)}_{n=1}^{infty} ). Let ( epsilon > 0 ) and choose ( K = frac{2c}{epsilon} ). For integers ( m, n > K ) and without loss of generality, assume ( m geq n ). By Lemma 2, we have: [ |g(m) - g(n)| = left| g left( frac{m}{n} cdot n right) - g(n) right| < frac{2c}{K} = epsilon ] Thus, by the Cauchy criterion, the sequence ( {g(n)}_{n=1}^{infty} ) is convergent. Let the limit be ( h ). Assume ( f(x) ) takes only non-positive values. Let ( A = -f(0) geq 0 ), then for ( x > 0 ): [ -A leq f(x) leq 0 ] Therefore: [ |g(x)| = frac{-f(x)}{x} leq frac{A}{x} ] Thus for any ( epsilon > 0 ), if ( x > frac{A}{epsilon} ), then ( |g(x)| leq epsilon ), implying: [ lim_{x rightarrow infty} g(x) = 0 ] For the case when ( exists a ) such that ( f(a) > 0 ), then for any ( x > a ), ( f(x) > 0 ). Let's consider ( b = max(a+1, 0) ). If ( x > b ) and ( n = lfloor x rfloor ), then since ( f ) is monotonically increasing: [ frac{f(n)}{n+1} leq frac{f(x)}{x} leq frac{f(n+1)}{n} ] Converting to ( g ): [ frac{n}{n+1} g(n) leq g(x) leq frac{n+1}{n} g(n+1) ] As ( n ) tends to infinity, both sides approach ( h ). This implies that the limit ( lim_{x rightarrow infty} g(x) ) exists and is equal to ( h ). In conclusion, the limit ( lim_{x rightarrow infty} g(x) = k ). Assume for contradiction that ( f(x) - kx ) is not bounded on ( (0, infty) ). Then there exists some ( s > 0 ) such that ( |f(s) - ks| > 2c ). By Lemma 1, for any positive integer ( m ), [ |f(ms) - mf(s)| < mc ] Also: [ |m f(s) - mk s| > 2 mc Rightarrow |f(ms) - mk s| > mc Rightarrow left| frac{f(ms)}{ms} - k right| > frac{c}{s} Rightarrow |g(ms) - k| > frac{c}{s} ] Thus, the sequence ( {g(ms)}_{m=1}^{infty} ) does not converge to ( k ), which contradicts ( lim_{x rightarrow infty} g(x) = k ). Therefore, the function ( f(x) - kx ) is bounded on ( (0, infty) ). This implies that there exists a positive constant ( M ) such that ( |f(x) - kx| < M ) for ( x > 0 ). For ( x < 0 ), the conditions give: [ |f(x) + f(-x) - f(0)| < c Rightarrow |f(x) + f(-x)| < c + |f(0)| Rightarrow |f(x) - kx + (f(-x) + k(-x))| < c + |f(0)| Rightarrow |f(x) - kx| < c + |f(0)| + M = N ] Since ( N > |f(0)| ) and ( N > M ), we have: [ |f(x) - kx| < N ] for all real ( x ), meaning ( f(x) - kx ) is indeed bounded.

Establishing the restriction for the carriage number: - On Saturday, the number (date) was greater than the carriage number. - On Monday, they were equal.

There are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 60 minutes in an hour, so: - Uphill speed: 3 , text{km/h} = 3 times 1000 , text{m/km} / 60 , text{min/h} = 50 , text{m/min} - Downhill speed: 5 , text{km/h} = 5 times 1000 , text{m/km} / 60 , text{min/h} = 83.33 , text{m/min} 2. **Translate the problem into equations**: - The total distance covered is the sum of the distances covered uphill and downhill. Distance can be calculated as speed times time. Since we need the equation in terms of time, we convert the speeds into the units of the equation. The speed is already converted into meters per minute, so we use the time in minutes (x for uphill and y for downhill) to express the distance: - Uphill distance: (3/60)x , text{km/min} times 60 , text{min/h} = (3/60)x , text{km} - Downhill distance: (5/60)y , text{km/min} times 60 , text{min/h} = (5/60)y , text{km} - Since the total distance to school is 1200 meters or 1.2 kilometers, the equation for the distance is: - (3/60)x + (5/60)y = 1.2 - The total time taken is the sum of the times spent uphill and downhill, which gives us the second equation: - x + y = 16 Therefore, the system of equations based on the problem is: left{begin{array}{l} frac{3}{60}x + frac{5}{60}y = 1.2 x + y = 16 end{array}right. This corresponds to option B: boxed{B}."},{"prompt":"Given the set P={x|0leqslant xleqslant sqrt{2}}, and m=sqrt{3}, the correct relation among the following options is ( ).

We can solve it by comparing the values of sqrt{3} and sqrt{2}. **Step-by-Step Solution** 1. Compare the values of sqrt{3} and sqrt{2}: sqrt{3} > sqrt{2} 2. Examine the given set P={x|0leqslant xleqslant sqrt{2}}, which means set P contains all elements x where x is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to sqrt{2}. 3. Since sqrt{3} is greater than sqrt{2}, it does not belong to set P because its value is greater than the maximum value of the elements in set P. 4. Therefore, the relation mnotin P is correct.

This means the thief must be lying about not stealing the cookbook. - Furthermore, at least one of the other two accused persons is telling the truth, given that they are not the thief. 3. **Process of Elimination**: - If Cheshire Cat stole the cookbook, then both he and Герцогиня must be lying, which contradicts the information given because Герцогиня accused Cheshire Cat. - If Герцогиня stole the cookbook, she is lying about accusing Cheshire Cat, and Cheshire Cat is lying about admitting to theft, leaving Кухарка as the one telling the truth, who claims she didn’t steal the cookbook. 4. **Logical Consistency**: - Герцогиня accusing Cheshire Cat after having stolen the book herself means she is lying. - Cheshire Cat falsely admitting the theft is also a lie, consistent with the requirement that the thief is lying. - This leaves Кухарка (the cook) being truthful in stating she did not steal it, which does not contradict the problem's condition that at least one other accused person tells the truth.
