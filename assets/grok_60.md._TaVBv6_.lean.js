Consider that ( exp(mathbb{C}) = mathbb{C}^* ). Since ( f(f(z)) = exp(z) ), for any ( z in mathbb{C} ), ( exp(z) neq 0 ). Hence, ( f(f(z)) ) will always be a non-zero complex number. Next, assume ( f(0) = 0 ). This implies: [ 0 = f(f(0)) = exp(0) = 1, ] which is a contradiction. Hence, ( f(z) neq 0 ) for any ( z in mathbb{C} ). Therefore, ( mathbb{C}^* subset f(mathbb{C}) ). Now, let's consider if there exists some ( c ) such that ( f(c) = 0 ) for ( c neq 0 ). If such ( c ) exists, then there must be some ( x ) such that ( c = f(x) ). But then, [ 0 = f(c) = f(f(x)) = exp(x) neq 0, ] which is another contradiction. Therefore, there does not exist any ( c ) such that ( f(c) = 0 ). Thus, we conclude that: [ f(mathbb{C}) = mathbb{C}^*. ] 2. **Lemme 2: ( f(z + 2ipi) = f(z) )** To prove this lemma, consider the function composition and the exponential properties: [ f(f(f(z))) = f(exp(z)) ] By our given condition, ( f(f(z)) = exp(z) ), thus: [ f(f(z+2ipi)) = exp(f(z+2ipi)). ] Knowing that ( exp(z + 2ipi) = exp(z) ), we rewrite: [ f(exp(z + 2ipi)) = f(exp(z)) = exp(f(z)). ] Hence, there must exist a function ( k: mathbb{C} to mathbb{Z} ) such that: [ f(z + 2ipi) = f(z) + 2ipi k(z). ] Given that ( k ) is a continuous function and also takes integer values, we infer that ( k ) must be constant. Therefore, ( k = 0 ) since if ( k neq 0 ), there would exist ( z ) such that ( f(z) = -2ipi k(z) ) (due to Lemma 1), leading to: [ f(z + 2ipi) = 0, ] which contradicts Lemma 1 because ( f(z) neq 0 ). Therefore, we conclude that: [ f(z + 2ipi) = f(z). ] 3. **Combining Results and Contradiction** By Lemma 1, we know that there exist (a, b in mathbb{C}) such that ( f(a) = 2ipi ) and ( f(b) = 4ipi ). From Lemma 2, we can assume that ( operatorname{Im}(a), operatorname{Im}(b) in [0, 2pi) ). Consider: [ exp(a) = f(f(a)) quad text{and} quad exp(b) = f(f(b)). ] By Lemma 2 (and the periodicity): [ exp(a) = exp(b). ] Since the exponential function is periodic with period (2ipi), this implies: [ a equiv b pmod{2ipi}. ] However, considering (a) and (b) distinct, we get a contradiction because (a-b in 2ipi mathbb{Z}) would mean (f(a) ) and (f(b)) are different while they are supposed to be equal. # Conclusion [ boxed{f text{ does not exist}} ]"},{"prompt":"The area enclosed by the curve y=sin x, xin(0,2π) and the curve y=cos x, xin(0,2π) is ________.","completion":"This problem focuses on testing the geometric significance of definite integrals and integral calculation formulas.

Consider the setup where each planet in a certain system has an astronomer who is observing the nearest planet. Let's denote the number of planets by ( n ), which is an odd number. 2. Notice that the distance between any two planets is unique, meaning no two distances are the same. 3. Select the two planets that are closest to each other. Let's call these planets ( A ) and ( B ). The astronomers on ( A ) and ( B ) will observe each other since they are the closest to each other. 4. Now, let's exclude these two planets ( A ) and ( B ) from further consideration. This leaves us with ( n - 2 ) planets and ( n - 2 ) astronomers. 5. Consider if any astronomer on the remaining ( n - 2 ) planets is observing one of the already chosen planets ( A ) or ( B ). If even one astronomer does so, it implies that there will be ( n - 3 ) astronomers for ( n - 2 ) planets, which is insufficient. 6.

Now, repeat the same reasoning by selecting the next closest pair from these ( n - 2 ) planets. 7. Since ( n ) is odd, repeatedly excluding pairs of planets (each time reducing the count by 2) will eventually leave us with a single planet (when ( n ) is reduced to 1). 8.

Consider the natural number ( k ) such that: [ 2^k leq n < 2^{k+1} ] 4. Define ( M ) as the product of all odd numbers up to ( n ). We will consider the sum ( S_n ) and multiply each term by ( 2^{k-1}M ). 5. For each ( m leq n ), we have ( frac{1}{m} cdot 2^{k-1}M ). 6. Note that any natural number ( m ) can be written as ( m = 2^p cdot q ), where ( p ) is a non-negative integer, and ( q ) is an odd number. If ( m leq n ), then ( q leq n ). 7.

First, let's calculate the number of cases for each day and then sum them up. Day 1: f(1) = 300 * exp(0.1*1) = 300 * exp(0.1) Day 2: f(2) = 300 * exp(0.1*2) = 300 * exp(0.2) ... Day 14: f(14) = 300 * exp(0.1*14) = 300 * exp(1.4) Now, we need to sum these values from Day 1 to Day 14. This is a sum of an exponential sequence, which is not straightforward to calculate directly. However, we can approximate the total number of infections by calculating the integral of the function over the 14 days, which will give us the area under the curve of the function, representing the total number of cases. The integral of f(x) = 300 * exp(0.1*x) from x=0 to x=14 is: ∫(300 * exp(0.1*x)) dx from 0 to 14 Let's calculate this integral: ∫(300 * exp(0.1*x)) dx = (300/0.1) * exp(0.1*x) + C = 3000 * exp(0.1*x) + C We evaluate this from 0 to 14: = [3000 * exp(0.1*14)] - [3000 * exp(0.1*0)] = 3000 * exp(1.4) - 3000 * exp(0) = 3000 * exp(1.4) - 3000 * 1 Now we can calculate the value of exp(1.4) using a calculator: exp(1.4) ≈ 4.05 So the total number of infections over 14 days is approximately: = 3000 * 4.05 - 3000 * 1 = 12150 - 3000 = 9150 Therefore, the approximate total number of infections during the second wave over a period of 14 days is boxed{9150} cases."},{"prompt":"Given f(x)= begin{cases} x^{2}, & text{if } xgeq0 x, & text{if } x<0end{cases}, then f[f(2)] equals to ( ) A: 2 B: 3 C: 4 D: 5","completion":"Since -2<0, we have f(-2)=-(-2)=2; Since 2>0, we get f[f(-2)]=f(2)=2^{2}=4.

Each tells their neighbor to the left: There are no members of my tribe among the other five. It is known that natives lie to strangers and tell the truth to their own people. How many tribes are represented at the campfire?","completion":"1. We are given that seven natives sit around a campfire in a circle. Each one tells their left neighbor, \\"Among the other five, there are none from my tribe.\\" 2. Natives lie to foreigners and tell the truth to their own tribe members. 3. We aim to determine how many tribes are gathered around the campfire. **Initial Condition Analysis:** - If at least four natives belong to the same tribe, two of them must be sitting next to each other. This means one would lie to their own tribe member, which contradicts the given condition that a native tells the truth to their own tribe member. 4. If a native from any tribe is alone (i.e., there is only one native from that tribe), this native would also lie to their left neighbor since they are not from their tribe. This lies in contradiction with the condition that a native should tell the truth when speaking about their own tribe members. Thus, this scenario is also not possible. **Logical Deductions:** - Each tribe must have exactly two or three members among the seven natives. - Let's analyze the plausible combinations of tribe counts: 5. Consider the case of only two tribes: - If there were exactly two tribes, the maximum number of representatives for each tribe must satisfy ( 3 + 3 < 7 ). Therefore, if we assign three members to each tribe, we can only almost meet the total count of seven, which leaves the seventh member without a tribe — a contradiction. 6. Consider the case of three tribes: - With three tribes and the restriction that each tribe has either 2 or 3 members, we can distribute the seven natives into tribes as (2 + 2 + 3 = 7). - Let's illustrate this scenario: - Tribe A: 2 members - Tribe B: 2 members - Tribe C: 3 members 7. These distributions imply that: - No native will have more than one member from their tribe in the remaining group of five members. - Each native will see members from their own tribe positioned such that the statement about the other five members containing none from their own tribe is always accurate. 8.

Substituting ( x = frac{1}{2} ): [ y = frac{1}{2}(1-frac{1}{2}) = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{4} ] Thus, the maximum value of ( x(1-x) ) is ( frac{1}{4} ). 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the area of ( triangle A_1B_1C_1 ) is at most: [ S_{A_1B_1C_1} leq frac{1}{4} S_{ABC} ] [ blacksquare ]"},{"prompt":"The square root of x is greater than 3 and less than 5.

(0 < b < 1), implying (log_{b} (cdot)) is a decreasing function. 2. (0 < alpha < frac{pi}{4}), hence (0 < sin alpha < cos alpha < 1). Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Analyzing (log_{b} (sin alpha)) and (log_{b} (cos alpha)):** Since (0 < sin alpha < cos alpha < 1) and (0 < b < 1), it follows that: [ log_{b} (sin alpha) > log_{b} (cos alpha) ] because the logarithm base (b) (where (0 < b < 1)) is a decreasing function.

The government tax is 5% of the book's price, so: Tax = 5% of 600 = 0.05 * 600 = 30 The shipping fee is a flat rate, so it's just: Shipping fee = 20 Now, let's calculate the seller's discount, which is 3% of the book's price: Seller's discount = 3% of 600 = 0.03 * 600 = 18 The total cost of the book is then: Total cost = Book price + Tax + Shipping fee - Seller's discount Total cost = 600 + 30 + 20 - 18 Total cost = 630 + 20 - 18 Total cost = 650 - 18 Total cost = 632 Now, let's calculate the profit made from selling the book for 624: Profit = Selling price - Total cost Profit = 624 - 632 Profit = -8 Since the profit is negative, it means there is actually a loss, not a profit. To find the loss percentage, we use the formula: Loss percentage = (Loss / Total cost) * 100% Loss percentage = (-8 / 632) * 100% Loss percentage = -0.01265822785 * 100% Loss percentage = -1.265822785% So, the loss (negative profit) in percentage is approximately boxed{-1.27%} ."},{"prompt":"A 25 cm wide path is to be made around a circular garden having a certain diameter.

The radius of the garden would then be D/2 meters. When a path of width 25 cm (which is 0.25 meters) is made around the garden, the radius of the garden including the path becomes (D/2 + 0.25) meters. The area of the garden including the path can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle, A = πr², where r is the radius of the circle. So, the area of the garden including the path is: A_total = π * (D/2 + 0.25)² The area of just the garden (without the path) is: A_garden = π * (D/2)² The area of the path alone is the difference between the total area and the garden area: A_path = A_total - A_garden We are given that A_path is approximately 3.3379421944391545 square meters. So we can set up the equation: π * (D/2 + 0.25)² - π * (D/2)² = 3.3379421944391545 Let's solve for D: π * [(D/2 + 0.25)² - (D/2)²] = 3.3379421944391545 Divide both sides by π: (D/2 + 0.25)² - (D/2)² = 3.3379421944391545 / π Let's expand the squares: (D²/4 + D/4 + 0.0625) - D²/4 = 3.3379421944391545 / π The D²/4 terms cancel out: D/4 + 0.0625 = 3.3379421944391545 / π Now, let's solve for D: D/4 = (3.3379421944391545 / π) - 0.0625 D = 4 * [(3.3379421944391545 / π) - 0.0625] Now we can calculate the value of D: D = 4 * [(3.3379421944391545 / 3.141592653589793) - 0.0625] D ≈ 4 * [1.062252964426877 - 0.0625] D ≈ 4 * 0.999752964426877 D ≈ 3.999011857707508 So, the diameter of the garden is approximately boxed{4} meters."},{"prompt":"Two candles of the same initial height are lit simultaneously.

If the lines were to intersect adjacent sides, the resulting shapes would not be quadrilaterals but rather a triangle and a pentagon, which is not allowed according to the problem's constraints. 3. **Properties of Division**: Let’s consider a line intersecting BC at point M and AD at point N. The areas of the trapezoids ABMN and CDNM must be in the ratio 2:3 due to equal heights, implying their areas depend on the bases AB and CD along with the segment MN. For simplifying calculations: - Each line divides opposite sides of the square in the ratio 2:3. 4. **Mid-segment Analysis**: The line segment MN divides A to B segment and C to D segment in consistent ratios. Specifically, for a line segment PQ joining the midpoints of AB and CD, any such line intersects it dividing it in the same ratio, which provides consistent geometric conditions. 5. **Calculation of Intersection Points**: In the entire square, the division lines intersect at exactly four strategic points that segment the midlines of the square in the proportion 2:3. These four points come into play because each given line is defined by segments divided in the fixed ratio 2:3. 6. **Employing Combinatorial Argument**: Given there are four intersection points and nine lines, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these points must be shared by three lines. This argument follows that in a scenario divided into more sections than the objects distributed, overlap occurs in at least one section. # Conclusion: Thus, at least three of these nine lines must meet at a common point. Therefore, this geometric property helps in concluding our requirements by the pigeonhole principle and consistent segment analysis: boxed{ }\`\`\`"},{"prompt":"Let g(x) = x^2 6x + 5.

Given the problem's similarity conditions, we'll use the triangle similarity properties to find x. 4. **Using Triangle Similarity:** From the similarity of triangles BEC and DEA, we know the ratio of the areas of similar triangles is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides: [ S_{BEC} = left(frac{BE}{ED}right)^2 cdot S_{DCE} = left(frac{x}{3}right)^2 cdot 1 = frac{x^2}{3^2} = frac{x^2}{9} ] 5. **Express Areas via Ratios:** Similarly, [ S_{DEA} = left(frac{DE}{BE}right)^2 cdot S_{ABE} = left(frac{3}{x}right)^2 cdot 1 = frac{9}{x^2} ] 6. **Sum of Areas in Quadrilateral:** According to the problem's condition: [ S_{ABCD} = S_{ABE} + S_{DCE} + S_{BEC} + S_{DEA} leq 4 ] Substituting the given and found areas, we have: [ 1 + 1 + frac{x^2}{9} + frac{9}{x^2} leq 4 ] 7. **Simplifying the Inequality:** [ 2 + frac{x^2}{9} + frac{9}{x^2} leq 4 ] Rearranging, we get: [ frac{x^2}{9} + frac{9}{x^2} leq 2 ] 8. **Applying Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:** According to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, for all positive a and b, it holds that: [ frac{x^2}{9} + frac{9}{x^2} geq 2 ] Equality holds when: [ frac{x^2}{9} = frac{9}{x^2} ] which implies: [ x^4 = 81 implies x^2 = 9 implies x = 3 ] 9. **Verification of Solution:** Substituting x = 3 back into the inequality confirms the equality condition leads to: [ frac{3^2}{9} + frac{9}{3^2} = 1 + 1 = 2 ] So the side BC = 3 satisfies all given conditions.

Taking the derivative, we get h'(a)=2a-frac{1}{a}=frac{2a^{2}-1}{a}. Setting h'(a)=0, we find a=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. When 0 < a < frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, h'(a) < 0, so h(a) is decreasing.

On their turn, the first player divides the rectangle into two smaller ones with a single cut along the grid line. Then the second player chooses one of the two resulting rectangles, on which the game will continue (the other rectangle is discarded), and splits it into two smaller rectangles. Then the first player again chooses the rectangle on which the game will continue, and so on. The player who cannot make a cut on their turn loses. Which player can always win, regardless of the opponent's strategy?","completion":"We need to determine which player has a winning strategy under any circumstances in a game involving cutting a rectangular grid into smaller pieces. We examine a specific case: a rectangle of size 1000 times 2020. 1. **Statement of the Theorem:** We prove a more general fact: the first player (Petya) has a winning strategy if and only if the exponents of 2 in the prime factorizations of m and n differ. Conversely, if the exponents of 2 in m and n are the same, the second player (Vasya) has a winning strategy. 2. **Initial Factorization:** Write the side lengths m and n as m = 2^a cdot m_1 and n = 2^b cdot n_1, where m_1 and n_1 are odd, and a and b are non-negative integers. 3. **Good and Bad Situations:** - A good situation is when a neq b. - A bad situation is when a = b. 4. **Analysis of Good and Bad Situations:** If we are in a good situation (a neq b), Petya can always make a move that leaves Vasya in a bad situation. Conversely, if in a bad situation (a = b), Vasya can always make a move that keeps Petya in a bad situation. 5. **Proof by Induction:** - **Base Case:** For 1000 times 2020, we know 1000 = 2^3 times 125 and 2020 = 2^2 times 505. Here, the exponents are a = 3 and b = 2, so a neq b, meaning Petya starts in a good situation. - **Induction Step:** Suppose any rectangular piece 2^a times 2^b where a neq b is cut, Petya ensures that the resulting piece selected for the next turn by Vasya still results in a different power of 2 in its factorization. Petya's strategy will be to always perform a cut that forces Vasya to choose a piece maintaining bad parity for Petya's next turn. Conversely, if a = b, Vasya can always reestablish a new piece such that a = b continues for Petya. 6. **Game Dynamics:** On every turn: - If Petya is in a good situation, he can enforce a transition that leads Vasya back to a bad configuration concerning the powers of 2. - If Vasya is in a bad situation, any cut made by Petya will necessarily be countered by Vasya remaining in a bad situation or moving to a good situation suitable for Petya's winning dynamics. 7. **Conclusion:** For the initial rectangle 1000 times 2020, since 1000 = 2^3 cdot 125 and 2020 = 2^2 cdot 505, Petya (the first player) can always force a configuration favorable to himself by leveraging the differing powers of 2.

He invests 25% of the bars in a stock with prices linked to gold value and earns an additional gold bar after the prices rise. After the investment, he exchanges the remaining gold bars to another currency given the variable exchange rates. On Monday, the exchange rate is 5 silver bars for 1 gold bar; on Tuesday, it's 7 silver bars for 1 gold bar, and on Wednesday, it's down to 3 silver bars for 1 gold bar. James exchanges half of his remaining gold bars on each consecutive day from Monday to Wednesday. How many silver bars, remaining gold bars, and gold bars worth from the stock investment does James have after these transactions?","completion":"Let's break down the transactions step by step: 1. James starts with 60 gold bars. 2. He pays 10% in tax, which is 60 * 0.10 = 6 gold bars. 3. After paying taxes, he has 60 - 6 = 54 gold bars left. 4. He loses half in a divorce, so he has 54 / 2 = 27 gold bars left. 5. He invests 25% of his remaining gold bars in the stock market, which is 27 * 0.25 = 6.75, but since we can't have a fraction of a gold bar, we'll assume he invests 6 gold bars. 6. After the investment, he has 27 - 6 = 21 gold bars left. 7. The investment earns him an additional gold bar, so he now has 21 + 1 = 22 gold bars. 8. On Monday, he exchanges half of his gold bars at a rate of 5 silver bars for 1 gold bar. He exchanges 22 / 2 = 11 gold bars, which gets him 11 * 5 = 55 silver bars. 9. After Monday's exchange, he has 22 - 11 = 11 gold bars left. 10. On Tuesday, he exchanges half of his remaining gold bars at a rate of 7 silver bars for 1 gold bar. He exchanges 11 / 2 = 5.5, but since we can't have a half gold bar, we'll assume he exchanges 5 gold bars, which gets him 5 * 7 = 35 silver bars. 11. After Tuesday's exchange, he has 11 - 5 = 6 gold bars left. 12. On Wednesday, he exchanges half of his remaining gold bars at a rate of 3 silver bars for 1 gold bar. He exchanges 6 / 2 = 3 gold bars, which gets him 3 * 3 = 9 silver bars. 13. After Wednesday's exchange, he has 6 - 3 = 3 gold bars left. Now, let's add up all the silver bars he has: - From Monday: 55 silver bars - From Tuesday: 35 silver bars - From Wednesday: 9 silver bars Total silver bars = 55 + 35 + 9 = 99 silver bars James has 3 gold bars left after all the exchanges, and he has 6 gold bars worth from the stock investment (since he earned an additional gold bar after the prices rose).

The polynomial is given by: [ (x+a)(x^2+bx+c)(x^3+dx^2+ex+f)=0 ] This polynomial is a product of three polynomials of degrees 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The total degree of the polynomial is (1 + 2 + 3 = 6). Therefore, it has 6 roots. Since the roots of the polynomial are the solutions to the equation, we need to check if these roots can be integers. Let's denote the roots by (r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6). The polynomial can be written as: [ (x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3)(x-r_4)(x-r_5)(x-r_6) = 0 ] Comparing this with the given polynomial, we need to find integers (a, b, c, d, e, f) such that the roots (r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6) are integers. Since the coefficients of the polynomial are integers, by the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of the polynomial must be an integer. Therefore, it is possible to find integers (a, b, c, d, e, f) such that they are the 6 roots of the polynomial. (boxed{text{True}}) 2. **Problem 2:** In a certain country, there are 2023 islands and 2022 bridges, such that every bridge connects two different islands and any two islands have at most one bridge in common, and from any island, using bridges, one can get to any other island. If in any three islands there is an island with bridges connected to each of the other two islands, call these three islands an \\"island group\\". We know that any two \\"island groups\\" have at least 1 common island. What is the minimum number of islands with only 1 bridge connected to it? To solve this problem, we need to analyze the structure of the graph formed by the islands and bridges. The graph has 2023 vertices (islands) and 2022 edges (bridges). Since the graph is connected and has (n-1) edges, it is a tree. In a tree, there are always at least two leaves (vertices with degree 1). We need to find the minimum number of leaves in this tree. Given that any two \\"island groups\\" have at least one common island, we can infer that the tree has a high degree of connectivity. However, since the tree has 2023 vertices and 2022 edges, it must have at least two leaves. Therefore, the minimum number of islands with only 1 bridge connected to it is: (boxed{2}) 3. **Problem 3:** In (triangle ABC), points (P, Q) satisfy (angle PBC = angle QBA) and (angle PCB = angle QCA), (D) is a point on (BC) such that (angle PDB = angle QDC). Let (X, Y) be the reflections of (A) with respect to lines (BP) and (CP), respectively. Prove that (DX = DY). To prove that (DX = DY), we need to use the properties of reflections and angles. Since (X) and (Y) are the reflections of (A) with respect to lines (BP) and (CP), respectively, we have: [ angle BAX = angle PAX quad text{and} quad angle CAY = angle PAY ] Also, since (angle PBC = angle QBA) and (angle PCB = angle QCA), we have: [ angle PBD = angle QBD quad text{and} quad angle PCD = angle QCD ] Therefore, (angle PDB = angle QDC). Since (D) is a point on (BC) such that (angle PDB = angle QDC), we have: [ angle PDB = angle QDC ] Therefore, (D) is the midpoint of (BC). Since (X) and (Y) are the reflections of (A) with respect to lines (BP) and (CP), respectively, we have: [ DX = DY ] Therefore, we have proved that (DX = DY).

The circumcenter of triangle (ABE) is denoted as (K). Point (X) is the reflection of point (B) with respect to the line (CD), and point (Y) is the point on the plane such that quadrilateral (DKEY) is a parallelogram. Prove that the points (D, E, X, Y) are concyclic. To prove that the points (D, E, X, Y) are concyclic, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and reflections. Since (X) is the reflection of (B) with respect to the line (CD), we have: [ angle BCD = angle XCD ] Also, since (Y) is the point on the plane such that quadrilateral (DKEY) is a parallelogram, we have: [ angle DKE = angle DYE ] Therefore, the points (D, E, X, Y) are concyclic. (blacksquare) 5. **Problem 8:** In a grid of (100 times 100) squares, there is a mouse on the top-left square, and there is a piece of cheese in the bottom-right square. The mouse wants to move to the bottom-right square to eat the cheese. For each step, the mouse can move from one square to an adjacent square (two squares are considered adjacent if they share a common edge). Now, any divider can be placed on the common edge of two adjacent squares such that the mouse cannot directly move between these two adjacent squares. A placement of dividers is called \\"kind\\" if the mouse can still reach the cheese after the dividers are placed. Find the smallest positive integer (n) such that, regardless of any \\"kind\\" placement of 2023 dividers, the mouse can reach the cheese in at most (n) steps. To solve this problem, we need to analyze the structure of the grid and the placement of dividers. The grid has (100 times 100 = 10000) squares, and the mouse can move from one square to an adjacent square. Since the mouse can move from one square to an adjacent square, the shortest path from the top-left square to the bottom-right square is (100 + 100 - 2 = 198) steps. Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer (n) such that, regardless of any \\"kind\\" placement of 2023 dividers, the mouse can reach the cheese in at most (n) steps. Since the dividers can block the mouse's path, the mouse may need to take a longer path to reach the cheese. However, since the dividers are \\"kind\\", the mouse can still reach the cheese. Therefore, the smallest positive integer (n) such that, regardless of any \\"kind\\" placement of 2023 dividers, the mouse can reach the cheese in at most (n) steps is: (boxed{2023})"},{"prompt":"Jane has seven books on her shelf, and their widths in centimeters are 3, dfrac{3}{4}, 1.2, 4, 9, 0.5, and 8.

Then: [ k_i^{2018} = (S - k_i^{2018})^{2018}. ] Taking the 2018th root of both sides, we get: [ k_i = S - k_i^{2018}. ] This implies: [ S = k_i + k_i^{2018}. ] 6. **Check consistency across all ( x_i ):** Since ( S ) is the same for all ( i ), we must have: [ S = k_1 + k_1^{2018} = k_2 + k_2^{2018} = cdots = k_n + k_n^{2018}. ] This implies that all ( k_i ) must be equal. Let ( k = k_i ) for all ( i ). Then: [ S = k + k^{2018}. ] 7. **Solve for ( k ):** Since ( S = n cdot k^{2018} ) (because ( x_i = k^{2018} ) for all ( i )), we have: [ n cdot k^{2018} = k + k^{2018}. ] Simplifying, we get: [ (n-1)k^{2018} = k. ] If ( k = 0 ), then ( x_i = 0 ) for all ( i ), which is a solution. 8. **Consider ( k neq 0 ):** If ( k neq 0 ), we can divide both sides by ( k ): [ (n-1)k^{2017} = 1. ] Since ( k ) is an integer, ( k^{2017} ) must be 1, which implies ( k = 1 ) or ( k = -1 ). However, ( k = -1 ) is not possible because ( k^{2018} ) would be positive. Thus, ( k = 1 ). 9. **Verify the solution ( k = 1 ):** If ( k = 1 ), then ( x_i = 1 ) for all ( i ), and ( S = n cdot 1 = n ). This satisfies the original equations. Conclusion: The integer solutions to the system are ( x_i = 0 ) for all ( i ) or ( x_i = 1 ) for all ( i ).

Determine the arrangement of the numbers where this sum is maximized. # Reference Solution: 1. **Lemma**: * Suppose the numbers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1999} are placed around a circle such that a_1 > a_{1998}. For any 2 leq i leq 999, swap a_i and a_{1999-i} if a_i < a_{1999-i}. * If during swaps at least one pair of numbers was exchanged, the sum of the products of the sets of ten consecutive numbers increased. 2. **Proof of the Lemma**: - Consider symmetrical groups of 10 numbers: a_i, ldots, a_{i+9} and a_{1999-i}, ldots, a_{1990-i}. - Let: * ( z ) be the product of numbers present in both groups (if none, set ( z=1 )). * ( x ) and ( x' ) be the products of the numbers existing only in the first and second groups respectively and not swapped. * ( y ) and ( y' ) be the products of the numbers existing only in the first and second groups respectively and swapped. * The sum of the products before the operation is ( s_1 = zxy + zx'y' ). * The sum of the products after the operation is ( s_2 = zxy' + zx'y ). Then: [ s_1 - s_2 = z(x - x')(y - y') ] Since ( x geq x' ) and ( y leq y' ), it follows that ( s_1 leq s_2 ). - If at least one pair of numbers is swapped, there exists a pair of symmetrical groups such that the difference s_1 - s_2 will be strictly negative, i.e., the sum of the products increased. - Consequently, either all pairs remain unchanged (optimal arrangement) or at least one pair improves the sum. 3. **Solution to the Problem**: - Assume the numbers from 1 to 1999 are optimally arranged such that no pair will ever be swapped, leading to an optimal arrangement. - Let's apply symmetry over various axes of the circle: * Consider a symmetry where smaller numbers are in one semicircle and larger numbers in the opposite. - Label the numbers a_1, ldots, a_{1999} starting from a maximum neighbor and ending at 1. - Since the optimal arrangement ensures pairs aren't swapped, larger numbers are together: * Arrange symmetrically to maximize the product. 4. **Optimal Arrangement**: - Start placing numbers beginning with larger values decreasing towards the center of symmetry ensuring summation of maximal product sets: - In the end, match the opposite: For any (k): * 2k, 2k-2, ldots, 2 followed by 1,3, ldots, 2k-1 along the circle. - Hence, the arrangement maximizes the sums over sets of ten numbers. # Conclusion: The optimal arrangement where the sum of the products of all sets of 10 consecutive numbers is the highest can be achieved by arranging the sequence symmetrically with larger numbers in one semi-circle and smaller in another.

This implies that at least one of the four angles angle AOB, angle BOC, angle COD, angle DOA must be at least 90^circ.

We will consider both a convex and a concave deltoid. Step 1: Analyzing the convex deltoid From the problem, we know that: - The sides (AB) and (BC) are both 1 unit in length. - The diagonals (AC) and (BD) are also 1 unit each. In any polygon, the diameter is defined as the longest distance between any two vertices. For the convex deltoid: 1. Consider the triangle (ABD): - It contains an angle of (30^circ). - The side (AD) opposite to this (30^circ) angle is less than 1 unit, which follows directly from the properties of the isosceles triangle with side lengths 1 unit and an included angle of (30^circ). 2. Consequently, the diameter of the convex deltoid is determined by the sides (AC) and (BD), which are both 1 unit. Therefore, any straight line dividing the deltoid will result in at least one segment retaining a part of the triangle (ABC) (an equilateral triangle), maintaining a diameter of 1 unit. Thus, it is evident that the convex deltoid (ABCD) cannot be divided into two smaller diameter parts. Conclusion from Step 1: Therefore, the convex deltoid cannot be divided into two smaller-diameter pieces. Step 2: Analyzing the concave deltoid Next, consider if the deltoid is concave: 1. The diameter, following Pythagoras' theorem, will be related to distances (AD) and (DC). Given the special configuration, these can be calculated as follows: - (AD = DC = sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}}). 2. A strategic division can be done by a line passing through point (B) and parallel to (AC). Since the convex parts made by this division will have smaller diameters than the maximum diameter of ( sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}} ). Conclusion from Step 2: Therefore, the concave deltoid can be divided into two parts with smaller diameters by a line passing through (B) and parallel to (AC). # Conclusion: To summarize, the convex deltoid cannot be split into two smaller-diameter sections using any line, while the concave deltoid can be divided by a specific line through point (B).

For example, 6 is square-free (since its prime factorization is (2 times 3)), but 12 is not (since (12 = 2^2 times 3)). 3. **Claim**: The maximal subset ( S ) consists of 1 plus all the square-free positive integers less than or equal to 500. 4. **Proof of the claim**: - **Step 1**: Consider a positive integer ( k ). Let ( G_k ) denote the set of all positive integers ( m ) such that ( m leq 500 ) and ( mk ) is a perfect square. - **Step 2**: For a square-free ( k ), every combination of two distinct elements of ( G_k ) multiply to be a perfect square. This is because if ( k ) is square-free, ( k ) can be written as ( p_1 p_2 ldots p_n ) where ( p_i ) are distinct primes. Any ( m ) such that ( mk ) is a perfect square can be written as ( m = b^2 k ) for some integer ( b ). Thus, ( G_k = {k, 4k, 9k, 16k, ldots} ). - **Step 3**: Let ( T = {G_1, G_2, G_3, G_5, G_6, G_7, G_{10}, ldots} ) be the set of all ( G_k ) such that ( k ) is square-free and ( k leq 500 ). Note that ( G_1 ) is the set of all perfect squares less than 500. - **Step 4**: Since all positive integers ( n > 1 ) that are divisible by a perfect square greater than 1 would be an element of at least one of the elements in ( T ), the set ( T ) contains all positive integers less than or equal to 500. Also, ( T ) has no overlapping elements, meaning every positive integer less than or equal to 500 is in ( T ) exactly once. 5. **Upper bound**: Since for all ( G_k in T ), every combination of two distinct elements of ( G_k ) multiply to be a perfect square, at most one element of every ( G_k ) can be in the subset ( S ). Thus, the upper bound for the desired answer is the number of elements in ( T ), which is the number of square-free integers less than or equal to 500 including 1. 6. **Counting square-free numbers**: - **Prime numbers**: There are 95 prime numbers less than 500. - **Semiprimes (product of two distinct primes)**: - ( 2 cdot p_2 ): ( p_2 ) ranges from 3 to 241, total 52. - ( 3 cdot p_2 ): ( p_2 ) ranges from 5 to 163, total 36. - ( 5 cdot p_2 ): ( p_2 ) ranges from 7 to 97, total 22. - ( 7 cdot p_2 ): ( p_2 ) ranges from 11 to 71, total 16. - ( 11 cdot p_2 ): ( p_2 ) ranges from 13 to 43, total 9. - ( 13 cdot p_2 ): ( p_2 ) ranges from 17 to 37, total 6. - ( 17 cdot p_2 ): ( p_2 ) ranges from 19 to 29, total 3. - ( 19 cdot p_2 ): ( p_2 ) is 23, total 1. - Total semiprimes: ( 52 + 36 + 22 + 16 + 9 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 145 ). - **Sphenic numbers (product of three distinct primes)**: - ( 2 cdot 3 cdot p_3 ): ( p_3 ) ranges from 5 to 83, total 21. - ( 2 cdot 5 cdot p_3 ): ( p_3 ) ranges from 7 to 47, total 12. - ( 2 cdot 7 cdot p_3 ): ( p_3 ) ranges from 11 to 31, total 7. - ( 2 cdot 11 cdot p_3 ): ( p_3 ) ranges from 13 to 19, total 3. - ( 2 cdot 13 cdot p_3 ): ( p_3 ) ranges from 17 to 19, total 2. - ( 3 cdot 5 cdot p_3 ): ( p_3 ) ranges from 7 to 31, total 8. - ( 3 cdot 7 cdot p_3 ): ( p_3 ) ranges from 11 to 23, total 5. - ( 3 cdot 11 cdot p_3 ): ( p_3 ) is 13, total 1. - ( 5 cdot 7 cdot p_3 ): ( p_3 ) ranges from 11 to 13, total 2. - Total sphenic numbers: ( 21 + 12 + 7 + 3 + 2 + 8 + 5 + 1 + 2 = 61 ). - **Numbers of the form ( p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4 )**: - ( 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot p_4 ): ( p_4 ) ranges from 7 to 13, total 3. - ( 2 cdot 3 cdot 7 cdot p_4 ): ( p_4 ) is 11, total 1. - Total: ( 3 + 1 = 4 ). 7. **Total number of square-free numbers**: - Including 1, the total number of elements in ( U ) is ( 1 + (95 + 145 + 61 + 4) = 306 ).

Specifically, if a = 1, then for any b and n, we have 1 mid (b^n - n), which is always true.

We want to inscribe a triangle ( H = PQR ) in ( S ) such that one of its sides is parallel to one side of ( S ). Our goal is to find the maximum possible ratio of the area of ( H ) to the area of ( S ). 2. **Setting Up the Triangle**: Let ( PQ ) be the side of triangle ( H ) that is parallel to ( AB ). Assume ( P ) lies on side ( AF ) and ( Q ) lies on side ( BC ) of the hexagon. To maximize the area of ( H ), ( R ) should lie on ( DE ) such that ( PR ) and ( QR ) are as large as possible; for simplicity, let ( R ) be the midpoint of ( DE ). 3. **Mathematical Representation**: We need to calculate the areas step by step: **The area of the hexagon ( S )**: [ text{Area of } S = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} a^2 ] **Analyzing Triangle ( H )**: - When ( P ) bisects ( AF ), ( PQ ) will also bisect ( BC ). Hence, ( P = M ) (midpoint of ( AF )) and ( Q = N ) (midpoint of ( BC )). - We calculate the lengths of these segments and their coordinates. 4. **Coordinate and Length Calculation**: In a regular hexagon with side length ( a ): - ( P ) and ( Q ) lie at a distance ( frac{asqrt{3}}{2} ) from the opposite sides. - The perpendicular distance (height) from ( PQ ) to the side of the hexagon, given the properties of the regular hexagon, is ( a sqrt{3} ). 5. **Calculating the Area of ( H )**: - Since all sides of the hexagon are equal and the height is ( a sqrt{3} ), the area ( H ) inscribed in this configuration can be computed as: [ text{Area of } H = frac{1}{2} times (AB + AF) times frac{asqrt{3}}{2} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} a^2 ] 6. **Deriving the Ratio**: - Combining these results, the maximum area of the triangle ( H ) is ( frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} a^2 ) and the area of ( S ) is ( frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} a^2 ). - Therefore, the ratio of the areas is: [ text{Ratio} = frac{text{Area of } H}{text{Area of } S} = frac{frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} a^2}{frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} a^2} = frac{3}{8} ] # Conclusion: The maximum possible ratio of the area of triangle ( H ) to the area of hexagon ( S ) is: [ boxed{frac{3}{8}} ]"},{"prompt":"Stacy has 32 berries.

Prove that every point inside D is the midpoint of a segment joining two points of S.","completion":"1. **Assume for contradiction**: Suppose there exists a point ( x in partial D ) such that ( x notin S ). Since ( S ) is closed, there exists an open disk ( D(x, varepsilon) ) centered at ( x ) with radius ( varepsilon > 0 ) that does not intersect ( S ). This means ( D(x, varepsilon) cap S = emptyset ). 2. **Consider the intersection of circles**: Let ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) be the two points where the boundary of ( D ), denoted ( partial D ), intersects the boundary of ( D(x, varepsilon) ), denoted ( partial D(x, varepsilon) ). These points ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) lie on both circles. 3. **Half-plane argument**: The line segment ( x_1 x_2 ) divides the plane into two half-planes. Since ( S ) is contained within ( D ) and ( x notin S ), ( S ) must lie entirely within one of these half-planes. 4. **Construct a larger circle**: Consider a circle passing through ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) with a sufficiently large radius such that it contains ( S ). Since ( S ) is in one of the half-planes determined by the line ( x_1 x_2 ), we can choose this circle to contain ( S ). 5. **Contradiction**: However, this larger circle does not contain ( D ) because ( x ) (which is on the boundary of ( D )) is outside this larger circle. This contradicts the given condition that ( D ) is a subset of every closed disk that contains ( S ). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our assumption that ( x notin S ) must be false. Hence, every point on the boundary ( partial D ) must belong to ( S ). Thus, ( partial D subset S ). 7. **Midpoint argument**: Now, consider any point ( y ) inside ( D ). Since ( y ) is inside ( D ), we can draw a line segment from ( y ) to any point on ( partial D ). Let ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) be two points on ( partial D ) such that ( y ) is the midpoint of the segment ( z_1 z_2 ). Since ( partial D subset S ), both ( z_1 ) and ( z_2 ) are in ( S ). 8. **Final result**: Therefore, every point inside ( D ) is the midpoint of a segment joining two points of ( S ).

A: gleft(xright)=sin x B: gleft(xright)=sin x C: g(x)=cos(x+frac{π}{4}) D: g(x)=cos(xfrac{π}{4})","completion":"Given that f(x) = Acos(2x + varphi) is an odd function, and it's given that fleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) = -1, we need to find the corresponding function g(x) when the abscissa of all points on the graph of f(x) is doubled while the ordinate remains unchanged. 1. Since f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-x) = -f(x). This property, combined with the form of f(x) = Acos(2x + varphi), implies that varphi must satisfy certain conditions to make f(x) odd. Specifically, for cos(2x + varphi) to be odd, varphi must equal frac{pi}{2} + kpi where k in mathbb{Z}, considering the periodicity and symmetry of the cosine function. Given |varphi| < pi, we find that varphi = frac{pi}{2} or varphi = -frac{pi}{2}. 2. Using the condition fleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) = -1, we substitute into the function to get Acosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + varphiright) = -1. Since A > 0, for the cosine function to yield a negative value, cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + varphiright) must be negative, which narrows down varphi = -frac{pi}{2} (since cosleft(frac{3pi}{2} + frac{pi}{2}right) = cos(2pi) = 1 would not satisfy the condition). 3. With varphi = -frac{pi}{2} and the equation simplified, we find that A = 1 to satisfy the given condition fleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) = -1. Therefore, the function simplifies to f(x) = cos(2x - frac{pi}{2}). Using the trigonometric identity cos(x - frac{pi}{2}) = sin(x), we can rewrite f(x) as f(x) = sin(2x). 4. When the abscissa of all points on the graph of f(x) is doubled while the ordinate remains unchanged, the function f(x) becomes g(x). Since f(x) = sin(2x), when we double the abscissa, the function effectively becomes g(x) = sin(x) because the doubling of the abscissa in f(x)'s argument is undone.

First, note the following means and exponents in our inequality: - Mean of order 8: (M_8(a, b, c, d)) - Mean of order 4: (M_4(a, b, c, d)) - Mean of order 3: (M_3(a, b, c, d)) The Power Mean Inequality states: M_8(a, b, c, d) geq M_4(a, b, c, d) quad text{and} quad M_4(a, b, c, d) geq M_3(a, b, c, d). 3. **Specific Application**: Given the numbers (a^8, b^3, c^8, d^3), we apply the inequality. We first calculate each power mean for two elements combination: For (a text{ and } c): left(frac{a^{8} + c^{8}}{2}right)^{frac{1}{8}} quad text{and} quad left(frac{a^{4} + c^{4}}{2}right)^{frac{1}{4}}. Since 8 > 4, the Power Mean Inequality gives: (M_8(a^8, c^8)) geq (M_4(a^4, c^4)) implies left( frac{a^{8} + c^{8}}{2} right)^{frac{1}{8}} geq left( frac{a^{4} + c^{4}}{2} right)^{frac{1}{4}}.

Since 8 > 4, the Power Mean Inequality gives: (M_3(b^3, d^3)) geq (M_8(b^8, d^4)) implies left( frac{b^{3} + d^{3}}{2} right)^{frac{1}{3}} geq left( frac{b^{8} + d^{4}}{2} right)^{frac{1}{8}}. 4. **Combining the Results**: Combining both elements, we consider the entire inequality: left(frac{a^{8} + b^{3} + c^{8} + d^{3}}{4}right)^{frac{1}{2}} leq left(frac{a^{4} + b^{8} + c^{8} + d^{4}}{4}right)^{frac{1}{2}}. 5. **Squaring Both Sides**: Squaring both sides uncovers the inequality in the original problem: left( a^{8} + b^{3} + c^{8} + d^{3} right)^2 leq 4 left( a^{4} + b^{8} + c^{8} + d^{4} right). # Conclusion: Hence, we have shown that left(a^{8}+b^{3}+c^{8}+d^{3}right)^{2} leq 4left(a^{4}+b^{8}+c^{8}+d^{4}right).

The points where the excircles touch the sides are given as follows: - The excircle opposite to (A) touches (BC) at (A_{1}). - The excircle opposite to (B) touches (AC) at (B_{1}). 2. **Touch Points and Lengths**: Recall the properties of the excircle touch points relative to the triangle sides and the semiperimeter: - The length (CA_{1} = p - b), - The length (CB_{1} = p - a), - The lengths (BA_{1}) and (AB_{1}) both equal (p - c). 3. **Menelaus' Theorem Application**: We apply Menelaus' theorem to triangle (ACA_{1}) with the transversal line passing through (B) and the contact point (B_{1}). Menelaus’ theorem states that for a triangle (ABC) with a line cutting (AC) at (B_1), (CA') at (A_1), and (B_1A_1) through a common point, [ frac{AC}{CB_1} cdot frac{B_1N}{NA_1} cdot frac{A_1A}{AA_1} = 1 ] - Here, (AC = p - b) - (CB_1 = p - a) - (AA_1 = CA_{1} = p - b) - (A_1A = (p - b)) Substituting the values in Menelaus' theorem yields a balanced equation: [ frac{(p-b)}{(p-a)} cdot x cdot 1 = 1, ] where (x = frac{B_1N}{NA_1}).

Thus, (P) must correspond to some point on the incircle of (triangle ABC) due to being derived from equal segment lengths.

Every rational number has a repeating or terminating decimal expansion. 2. **Assumption of Periodicity**: Let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that our decimal fraction is rational and therefore periodic. This implies that there exists a sequence T of n digits which is the repeating period beginning at some m-th decimal place. 3. **Properties of the Sequence T**: By the nature of periodicity, the sequence T must repeat every n digits from the m-th place onwards. Among any segment of n consecutive digits within this infinite decimal, the sequence T will appear, indicating a repetitive pattern. 4. **Detection of Non-Zero Digits**: In the infinite sequence 0.123456789101112ldots, since it includes all natural numbers written in order, there must be segments in the sequence which do not contain any repeated pattern of n digits. Specifically, consider the digit sequence that includes the digits of a number like 10^k where k > m and k > n. The decimal representation of 10^k will contain a 1 followed by k zeros. 5. **Contradiction Evidence**: The appearance of 10^k in the sequence will contain more than n zeros consecutively which contradicts the assumption that our sequence has a periodic section of n digits repeating. Specifically, it is impossible for n zeros to repeat periodically if within the expansion there exist segments (like 10^k) that invalidate such periodicity. 6. **Conclusion**: Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it implies that the infinite decimal fraction 0.1234567891011121314ldots cannot be a repeating decimal, which means it cannot be represented as a decimal expansion of any rational number.

For every increase of 1 yuan in the selling price, the monthly sales volume decreases by 10 kilograms. Thus, for a selling price of 45 yuan per kilogram, the decrease in sales volume can be calculated as follows: - Increase in price from 40 to 45 yuan: 45 - 40 = 5 yuan. - Decrease in sales volume: 5 times 10 = 50 kilograms.

Proposed by Shachar Carmeli, Weizmann Institute of Science","completion":"1. **Identify t-normal matrices**: A matrix ( A ) is called t-normal if ( AA^t = A^t A ), where ( A^t ) is the transpose of ( A ). Symmetric matrices, where ( A = A^t ), are trivially t-normal because ( AA^t = A^2 = A^t A ). 2. **Dimension of symmetric matrices**: The space of symmetric ( n times n ) matrices has dimension ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). This is because a symmetric matrix is determined by its entries on and above the main diagonal, which counts ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ) entries. 3. **Assume a larger space**: Assume we have a space ( S ) of t-normal matrices with dimension at least ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 ). The real dimension of ( S ) would then be at least ( n(n+1) + 2 ) because each complex dimension corresponds to two real dimensions. 4. **Construct a real space ( X )**: Consider the real space ( X ) of matrices of the form ( A + iB ), where ( A ) is a nilpotent upper triangular real matrix and ( B ) is a nilpotent lower triangular real matrix. The dimension of ( X ) is ( n(n-1) ) because there are ( frac{n(n-1)}{2} ) entries in both ( A ) and ( B ). 5. **Intersection of ( S ) and ( X )**: Since the dimension of ( S ) is greater than the dimension of ( X ), by the pigeonhole principle, ( S ) and ( X ) must have a non-trivial intersection. This means there exists a non-zero matrix ( A + iB ) in both ( S ) and ( X ). 6. **Analyze the intersection**: For ( A + iB ) to be t-normal, we have: [ (A + iB)(A^t + iB^t) = (A^t + iB^t)(A + iB) ] Taking the real part, we get: [ AA^t + B^tB = A^tA + BB^t ] This equation implies that the upper left corner of ( A ) and ( B^t ) must vanish. By induction on ( n ), this leads to ( A = 0 ) and ( B = 0 ), which is a contradiction since we assumed a non-zero matrix. 7. **Conclusion**: The contradiction implies that the maximum dimension of a linear space of t-normal matrices cannot exceed ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ). The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{n(n+1)}{2} } )."},{"prompt":"the quadrilateral (ABCD), the areas of triangles (ABC) and (ACD) are equal.

Since the areas of triangles ABC and ACD are equal, the triangles ABC and ACD_1 also have equal areas. 2. **Parallelism**: Because triangles ABC and ACD_1 have the same base AC and equal areas, their heights from B and D_1 to line AC must be equal. Consequently, BD_1 parallel AC as BD_1 lies in the plane ABCD and heights from the vertices must fall on the same line. 3. **Identifying Similar Angles**: Since BD_1 parallel AC, we have: [ angle BOA = angle D_1OC ] 4. **Isosceles Triangle**: Consider the triangle BOD_1. Given that angle BOA = angle D_1OC and both triangles intersect diagonally at O, the triangle BOD_1 is isosceles, meaning: [ BO = OD_1 ] 5. **Equating Distances**: Given the symmetry, BO = OD. Combining all facts, BO = OD, thus the diagonal BD is indeed bisected by AC. Therefore, B, O, D are collinear, and the point O lies in the middle of BD: [ B O = O D ] Second Method 1. **Projection onto AC**: Let P and Q be the orthogonal projections of the vertices B and D onto line AC. 2. **Comparing Triangles**: Since BP and DQ are heights from B and D respectively, and since these heights correspond to the equal area triangles with the same base AC: [ BP = DQ ] 3. **Right Triangles are Congruent**: The right triangles BPO and DQO are congruent by: - One leg: BP = DQ as previously mentioned. - One angle: They share the angle angle POQ as a commonly projected angle. From this, it follows: [ BO = OD ] 4. **Conclusion**: Since BO = OD, the point O is the midpoint of the diagonal BD. This means that BD is bisected by AC: [ BO = OD ] # Conclusion: Thus we have shown by two different methods that diagonal BD is divided into two equal segments by the diagonal AC. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A carpenter bought a piece of wood that was 0.41 meters long.

The second right triangle uses: - Same hypotenuse AB - Length of one of its legs (either appearing as another given height or given directly).

Since ( P ) is the longest path, ( v_{1} ) must be adjacent to at least one vertex ( v_i ) (where ( 3 leq i leq k )). Edges ( v_{1}v_{2} ) and ( v_{1}v_{i} ) form an angle. Removing these edges leaves the remaining graph connected with ( |E| - 2 ) edges. - Case 2: ( deg(v_{1}) = 1 ) and ( deg(v_{2}) = 2 ). In this case, ( { v_{1}v_{2}, v_{2}v_{3} } ) forms an angle.

Again, ({ v_{1}v_{2}, v_{2}v_{3} }) forms an angle. Removing these edges leaves the remaining graph connected as before. - Case 4: ( deg(v_{1}) = 1 ), ( deg(v_{2}) geqslant 3 ), and ( v_{2} ) connects to some ( u ) not in ( { v_{1}, v_{2}, ldots, v_{k} } ). Here, ({ v_{1}v_{2}, v_{2}u }) forms an angle. Removing these edges and checking if ( u ) results in an isolated vertex confirms that the rest of the graph remains connected. 5. **Conclusion of Theorem**: With these observations, it is confirmed that removing pairs of adjacent edges leaves the graph with at least (leftlfloor frac{|E|}{2} rightrfloor) disjoint angles. 6. **Application to Original Problem**: - Construct a graph ( G = (V, E) ) where ( |V| = 2019 ) and edges ( E ). We need to find the minimum ( n ) such that if ( |E| geqslant n ), then ( G) has at least 908 disjoint angles. - Set ( |E| = 2794 ). Begin by configuring edges between 61 vertices in (V), resulting in ( binom{61}{2} - 15 = 1815 ) edges (ensuring no isolated points). Then, distribute the remaining 1958 vertices into 979 pairs, each joined by an edge, resulting in ( 1815 + 979 = 2794 ). 7. **Verification**: - Demonstrating that no more than 907 pairs of edges without common vertices exist in (G) when ( |E| = 2794 ), ensuring that ( leftlfloor frac{2794}{2} rightrfloor = 907 ) holds. - If ( |E| geqslant 2795 ), using the theorem, there must be 908 or more disjoint angles. 8. **Final Step and Concluding Requirement**: Confirm that ( n = 2795 ) is indeed the smallest number meeting the problem's conditions.

The total number of pages in the book is 269.99999999999994 (which we can round to 270 for practical purposes): x + y = 270 Now we can solve for x and y using these two equations.

Let the side length of the cube be s. 3. **Geometry Analysis**: - The diagonal of the pyramid's base = 2sqrt{2} (since it is double the side length of the initial problem). - The height of the pyramid, h, is equal to the length of the sides of the lateral triangles since they are isosceles right triangles. Thus, h = 2. 4. **Distance Calculation**: - The diagonal of the cube's base = ssqrt{2}. - The distance from the center of the pyramid base to the center of the cube’s base = frac{2sqrt{2} - ssqrt{2}}{2}. 5. **Pythagorean Theorem in the Triangle Formed by the Side of the Cube and Lateral Faces**: - The remaining diagonal length divided equally on both sides of the cube's diagonal = frac{2sqrt{2} - ssqrt{2}}{2}. - Using Pythagorean Theorem: [ s^2 + left(frac{2sqrt{2} - ssqrt{2}}{2}right)^2 = 2^2 ] - Solving this equation: [ s^2 + frac{(2 - s)^2 cdot 2}{4} = 4 ] [ s^2 + frac{4 - 4s + s^2}{2} = 4 ] [ 2s^2 + 4 - 4s = 8 ] [ 2s^2 - 4s - 4 = 0 ] [ s^2 - 2s - 2 = 0 ] [ s = 1 pm sqrt{3} ] Since s must be positive and smaller than the pyramid's height, s = 1 + sqrt{3}. 6. **Calculate the Volume of the Cube**: [ V = s^3 = (1 + sqrt{3})^3 = 1 + 3sqrt{3} + 3cdot3 + sqrt{3}cdot3 = 10 + 6sqrt{3} ] Conclusion: The volume of the cube is 10 + 6sqrt{3}.

Here's the step-by-step solution: 1. **Identify the Unit Normal Vector**: The normal vector to the surface defined by (F(x, y, z) = 0) can be expressed as: vec{n}_{0} = pm frac{nabla F}{|nabla F|}, where in this case (F(x, y, z) = x + 2y + 3z - 1). - Compute the gradient: nabla F = left{ frac{partial F}{partial x}, frac{partial F}{partial y}, frac{partial F}{partial z} right} = {1, 2, 3}. - Compute the magnitude: |nabla F| = sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2} = sqrt{14}. Therefore, the unit normal vector is: vec{n}_{0} = pm frac{{1, 2, 3}}{sqrt{14}}. 2. **Determine the Correct Sign of the Normal Vector**: Given that the normal must form an acute angle with the OZ axis, we choose the positive sign such that: cos gamma = pm frac{3}{sqrt{14}} > 0. Thus, the unit normal vector is: vec{n}_{0} = left{ frac{1}{sqrt{14}}, frac{2}{sqrt{14}}, frac{3}{sqrt{14}} right}. 3. **Calculate the Dot Product** The scalar product of the vector field (vec{a}) and the unit normal vector (vec{n}_{0}) is: left( vec{a}, vec{n}_{0} right) = frac{1}{sqrt{14}} (-x + 4y + 3z). 4. **Set Up the Surface Integral** According to the flux formula: Phi = iint_{Sigma} left( vec{a}, vec{n}_{0} right) dsigma, we substitute our scalar product: Phi = iint_{Sigma} frac{1}{sqrt{14}} (-x + 4y + 3z) dsigma. 5. **Transform the Surface Integral to a Double Integral** Projecting the surface (Sigma) onto the (XOY) plane, and noting that (z = frac{1 - x - 2y}{3}), gives: Phi = iint_{D} frac{1}{sqrt{14}} left(-x + 4y + 3 cdot frac{1 - x - 2y}{3}right) frac{dx , dy}{|cosgamma|}, where (D) is the projection onto the (XOY) plane and (cos gamma = frac{3}{sqrt{14}}). 6. **Simplify the Inner Expression** Substituting (z): -x + 4y + (1 - x - 2y) = 1 - 2x + 2y. Thus: Phi = iint_{D} frac{1}{sqrt{14}} (1 - 2x + 2y) cdot frac{sqrt{14}}{3} , dx , dy, simplifying to: Phi = frac{1}{3} iint_{D} (1 - 2x + 2y) , dx , dy. 7. **Define the Integral Limits** The projection (D) on the (XOY) plane is determined by the constraints: Sigma = left{(x, y, z): begin{array}{l} x + 2y + 3z = 1 x geq 0, y geq 0, z geq 0 end{array} right}, which upon eliminating (z) translates to: D = left{ (x, y): begin{array}{l} 0 leq y leq frac{1}{2} 0 leq x leq 1 - 2y end{array} right}. 8. **Evaluate the Double Integral** Finally, we compute the integral: [ begin{aligned} Phi &= frac{1}{3} int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} int_{0}^{1 - 2y} (1 - 2x + 2y) , dx , dy = &= frac{1}{3} int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} left[ x - x^2 + 2xy right]_{0}^{1 - 2y} , dy = &= frac{1}{3} int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} left[ (1 - 2y) - (1 - 2y)^2 + 2y(1 - 2y) right] , dy = &= frac{1}{3} int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} left[ 1 - 2y - (1 - 4y + 4y^2) + 2y - 4y^2 right] , dy = &= frac{1}{3} int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} left[1 - 1 + 8y^2right] , dy = &= frac{1}{3} int_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} 8y^2 , dy = &= frac{8}{3} left[ frac{y^3}{3} right]_{0}^{frac{1}{2}} = &= frac{8}{3} left( frac{1}{8 cdot 3} right) = &= frac{1}{18}. end{aligned} ] Hence, the flux is: boxed{frac{1}{18}}."},{"prompt":"f the inequality x^2 + ax + 1 geq 0 holds for all x in (0, 1], find the minimum value of a.","completion":"The inequality x^2 + ax + 1 geq 0 holds for all x in (0, 1] if and only if a geq maxlimits_{x in (0, 1]} left(-x - frac{1}{x}right).

The semi-perimeter is given by: [ s = frac{a + b + c}{2} ] 3. **Utilizing the power of a point theorem** and other geometric properties, we derive the relationship between these elements.

From equation (2), we can express L in terms of S: L = 6S + 15 Now we can substitute this expression for L into equation (1): (6S + 15) - S = 1390 Simplifying this, we get: 5S + 15 = 1390 Subtract 15 from both sides: 5S = 1375 Now divide both sides by 5: S = 275 Now that we have the value of S, we can find L by substituting S back into equation (2): L = 6S + 15 L = 6(275) + 15 L = 1650 + 15 L = 1665 So the larger number is boxed{1665} ."},{"prompt":"he length of the bridge , which a train 180 metres long and travelling at 60 km / hr can cross in 25 seconds ,","completion":"To find the length of the bridge, we first need to calculate the distance the train travels in 25 seconds.

Thus no larger factor common to all possible sets of even integers occurs after adding 2. - The only universally guaranteed factor for all even numbers, 2, also fails because of the added 2. 5. **Conclusion:** The largest integer that divides the product of any three consecutive even integers plus 2 is 1.

To establish this, we'll explore numbers of the form ( a = n-1 ) and ( c = 2n-1 ). 3. **Constructing Potential Solutions**: Let's choose specific values for ( a ) and ( c ): [ a = n - 1, quad b = n - 1, quad c = 2n - 1, quad d = 2n - 1 ] The interest lies in analyzing the product pairs ( ab times cd ) and ( ac times bd ). 4. **Indecomposability Check**: First, we need to ensure that ( a ) and ( c ) each consider their squares in ( V_n ). To find out if ( a^2 ) and ( c^2 ) are indecomposable, we need to consider the form of their products: - ( a^2 = (n-1)^2 ) - ( ac = (n-1)(2n-1) ) - ( c^2 = (2n-1)^2 ) 5. **Examining ( a^2, ac, ) and ( c^2 )**: - Let's evaluate ( a^2 ): [ a^2 = (n-1)^2 = n^2 - 2n + 1 ] If ( a^2 ) is decomposable into ( x times y ) where ( x, y in V_n ), we must have: [ x + y equiv -2n+2 pmod{n} ] However, if ( x ) and ( y neq 1 + kn ), then: [ x, y geq 2n + 1 x times y > n^2 ] This concludes that ( a^2 ) (for ( n > 2 )) is indeed indecomposable. 6. **Indecomposability of ( ac )**: - Let's examine ( ac ): [ ac = (n-1)(2n-1) = 2n^2 - 3n + 1 ] For ( ac ) to be decomposable, it has to be expressible as ( (1+kn)(1+mn) ). This would imply: [ 1 + kn + mn + kmn^2 = 2n^2 - 3n + 1 kn + mn + kmn^2 = 2n^2 - 3n ] Simplifying ( k, m ) to find integer solutions for ( k ) and ( m geq 2 ) leads to no valid, smaller-size possible decompositions for general ( n ). # Conclusion: Thus, ( (n-1)^2 (2n-1)^2 ) can be factored in two distinct ways: as: [ (n-1)^2 times (2n-1)^2 = (n - 1(2n - 1))^2 ] This provides the two distinct factorization forms required by the problem.

Construct a rectangular parallelepiped (ABC D - A' B' C' D') where the sides are (cos alpha, cos beta, cos gamma). Note that (cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma = 1) means that the lengths of these sides squared add up to 1. 2. Obtain perpendicular lines: (C'D perp AD), (AA' perp A' C), (C'B perp AB). This ensures that: [ alpha = angle A'A C', quad beta = angle BA C', quad gamma = angle DA C' ] are all acute angles. 3. In the tetrahedron (A-A'C' B'), observe the following angle relationships: [ angle A'AC' + angle C'AB' > angle A'AB = frac{pi}{2} ] Since (alpha = angle A'AC') and (beta = angle C'AB'), we deduce: [ alpha + beta > frac{pi}{2} ] Similarly, for the other pairs of angles: [ beta + gamma > frac{pi}{2}, quad alpha + gamma > frac{pi}{2} ] Adding these inequalities, we obtain: [ (alpha + beta) + (beta + gamma) + (alpha + gamma) > 3 times frac{pi}{2} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 2(alpha + beta + gamma) > 3 pi /2 quad Rightarrow quad alpha + beta + gamma > 3pi /4 ] 4.

To find out how many trees the machine can cut in 10 hours at the new productivity rate, we can set up a proportion: 8 hours : 15 trees = 10 hours : x trees To solve for x, we cross-multiply and divide: (8 * x) = (15 * 10) 8x = 150 x = 150 / 8 x = 18.75 trees Since the machine can't cut a fraction of a tree, we'll round down to the nearest whole number.

However, the number of workers doesn't directly affect the number of trees cut if the machine's capacity is the limiting factor. Since the machine's productivity has already been accounted for with the repair and increased work hours, adding more workers would not increase the number of trees cut unless the machine was previously not operating at full capacity due to a lack of workers.

And the subset of this Tdiagram with 10 edges which covers all 20 vertexes(meaning any two edges in the subset doesn't cover the same vertex) calls a perfect matching of this Tdiagram. Among all the Tdiagrams, find the maximum number of perfect matching of a Tdiagram.","completion":"1. **Generalization and Definitions**: - Replace the 20-gon with a general convex 2n-gon P. - Define a diagonal of P as *odd* if there are an odd number of vertices on both sides of the diagonal, and *even* if there are an even number of vertices on both sides of the diagonal. - Note that all diagonals are either odd or even since 2n-2 is even. 2. **Lemma**: - **Statement**: For any T-diagram T of P, all perfect matchings of T have no odd diagonals. - **Proof**: - Assume there is an odd diagonal e in the perfect matching. - There must be a diagonal whose endpoints are on both sides of e. - This would mean it intersects e inside P, which contradicts the triangulation. - Therefore, no perfect matching can contain an odd diagonal. 3. **Fibonacci Sequence**: - Define F_1 = 1, F_2 = 2, and for all integers k ge 2, F_{k+2} = F_{k+1} + F_k. - Notice that {F_n} is the Fibonacci sequence. 4. **Induction Hypothesis**: - Claim: f(T) le F_n for any T-diagram T of a convex 2n-gon. - Base cases: - For n = 2: A convex quadrilateral P has no even diagonals, so the perfect matchings of T can only use the sides of P. Thus, f(T) = 2 = F_2. - For n = 3: All T-diagrams T of a convex hexagon P can have at most one even diagonal. If T has no even diagonals, f(T) = 2. If T contains one even diagonal, say A_1A_4, there is only one perfect matching with A_1A_4, with the other two sides being A_2A_3 and A_5A_6. Together with the two perfect matchings consisting of only sides, f(T) = 3. Hence, f(T) le 3 = F_3. 5. **Inductive Step**: - Assume the hypothesis holds for all integers less than n. - Consider a T-diagram T of a convex 2n-gon P = A_1A_2 ldots A_{2n}. - If T has no even diagonals, then f(T) = 2. - For an even diagonal e, let w(e) be the smaller number between the number of vertices of P on each side of e. - If T contains an even diagonal, take an even diagonal e in T such that w(e) is minimized. Let w(e) = 2k, where k is a positive integer. - Without loss of generality, let e be A_{2n}A_{2k+1}. - By the minimality of w(e), each A_i for i = 1, 2, ldots, 2k cannot be an endpoint of an even diagonal. - Thus, A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2k} can only be paired with their neighboring vertices. 6. **Case Analysis**: - **Case 1**: A_1A_2 is part of the perfect matching. - Sides A_3A_4, ldots, A_{2k-1}A_{2k} must also be part of the perfect matching. - Let convex (2n - 2k)-gon P_1 = A_{2k+1}A_{2k+2} ldots A_{2n}. - Removing A_1A_2, A_3A_4, ldots, A_{2k-1}A_{2k} from the perfect matching gives a perfect matching of a T-diagram of P_1, denoted T_1. - Thus, there are at most f(T_1) le F_{n - k} le F_{n - 1} perfect matchings from the induction hypothesis. - **Case 2**: A_1A_{2n} is part of the perfect matching. - Sides A_2A_3, ldots, A_{2k}A_{2k + 1} must also be part of the perfect matching. - Let convex (2n - 2k - 2)-gon P_2 = A_{2k + 2}A_{2k + 3} ldots A_{2n-1}. - Removing A_{2n}A_1, A_2A_3, ldots, A_{2k}A_{2k + 1} from the perfect matching gives a perfect matching of a T-diagram of P_2, denoted T_2. - Thus, there are at most f(T_2) le F_{n - k - 1} le F_{n - 2} perfect matchings from the induction hypothesis. 7. **Combining Cases**: - From both cases, we get at most F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2} = F_n perfect matchings of T. - The induction is complete. 8. **Achieving the Maximum**: - Construct a T-graph Delta_n of a convex 2n-gon A_1A_2 ldots A_{2n} composed of all 2n sides and the 2n - 3 diagonals A_2A_{2n}, A_{2n}A_3, A_3A_{2n-1}, A_{2n-1}A_4, A_4A_{2n-2}, ldots, A_{n + 3}A_n, A_nA_{n + 2}. - Verify that f(Delta_2) = 2 = F_2 and f(Delta_3) = 3 = F_3. - For n ge 4, consider the even chord A_{2n}A_3. Since w(A_{2n}A_3) = 2, k = 1 is satisfied. - For case 1, A_1A_2 is in the perfect matching, and since the T-graph of (2n-2)-gon A_3A_4 ldots A_{2n} is exactly Delta_{n-1}, there are f(Delta_{n-1}) perfect matches of Delta_n. - For case 2, A_{2n}A_1 and A_2A_3 are in the perfect matching, and since the T-graph of (2n-4)-gon A_4A_5 ldots A_{2n-1} is exactly Delta_{n-2}, there are f(Delta_{n-2}) perfect matches of Delta_n. - Thus, for n ge 4, we have f(Delta_n) = f(Delta_{n-1}) + f(Delta_{n-2}). - By induction, f(Delta_n) = F_n.

Define X' and Y' to be the images of the point X under transformations P and Q respectively. 5. **Applying the Cross-ratio Invariance Property** (Theorem 30.2): Recall that projective transformations preserve the cross-ratio of four points. Therefore, if X' and Y' are the images of X under transformations P and Q, respectively, we have: [ (A, B, C, X') = (A, B, C, Y') ] Here, (A, B, C, X') and (A, B, C, Y') denote the cross-ratios of the four points. 6. **Using the Uniqueness Property of Projective Transformations** (Theorem 30.3): Since the cross-ratios are preserved under projective transformations and given that (A, B, C, X') = (A, B, C, Y'), by the uniqueness property of projective transformations (Theorem 30.3), it follows that: [ X' = Y' ] 7. **Conclusion**: Since X' and Y' must be the same for all possible points X on the original line, this implies that both transformations P and Q act identically on every point of the line, making P and Q the same transformation.

This means that up to the 16th inning, the batsman scored a total of 16A runs. After scoring 95 runs in the 17th inning, the batsman's new average becomes A + 2.5. This means that the total runs scored after 17 innings is 17(A + 2.5). We can set up an equation to represent the total runs scored after 17 innings in two ways: 1. The total runs scored in the first 16 innings plus the runs scored in the 17th inning: Total runs after 17 innings = 16A + 95 2. The new average after the 17th inning multiplied by the number of innings: Total runs after 17 innings = 17(A + 2.5) Since both expressions represent the total runs after 17 innings, we can set them equal to each other: 16A + 95 = 17(A + 2.5) Now, let's solve for A: 16A + 95 = 17A + 42.5 95 - 42.5 = 17A - 16A 52.5 = A So, the average score of the batsman before the 17th inning was 52.5 runs. Now, we can find the new average after the 17th inning by adding 2.5 to the old average: New average after 17th inning = A + 2.5 New average after 17th inning = 52.5 + 2.5 New average after 17th inning = 55 Therefore, the batsman's average after the 17th inning is boxed{55} runs."},{"prompt":"**p10.** Three rectangles of dimension X times 2 and four rectangles of dimension Y times 1 are the pieces that form a rectangle of area 3XY where X and Y are positive, integer values.

Therefore, we have: [ f(1) cdot f(-1) leq 0 ] 3. **Evaluate at (1) and (-1)**: [ f(1) = 1 + a + b ] [ f(-1) = 1 - a + b ] 4. **Product of Values**: Consider the product: [ (1 + a + b)(1 - a + b) leq 0 ] 5. **Simplify the Expression**: Expand the product: [ (1 + a + b)(1 - a + b) = 1 + b - a^2 - b^2 = (1 + b)^2 - a^2 leq 0 ] 6. **Introduce (b)**: Let's proceed with evaluating the function at (b) and (-b): [ f(b) = b^2 + ab + b ] [ f(-b) = b^2 - ab + b ] 7. **Product of Evaluations**: [ f(b) cdot f(-b) = (b^2 + ab + b)(b^2 - ab + b) ] 8. **Simplify**: [ f(b) cdot f(-b) = (b(b + a + 1))(b(b - a + 1)) = b^2 (b^2 + b + ab)(b^2 + b - ab) ] Reducing it by rearranging and simplifying: [ f(b) cdot f(-b) = b^2 (b^2 + b)^2 - a^2 b^2 leq 0 ] 9. **Conclusion about Roots within ([-b, b])**: If (f(b)f(-b) leq 0), there must be at least one root in the interval ([-b, b]).

Since (2020 = 4 times 505), (k) must be a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 505. - From step 3, (gcd(2012, k) = 4). Since (2012 = 4 times 503), (k) must be a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 503. - From step 4, (gcd(8, 2020 + k) = 4).

The bus has a 4-hour head start, so by the time the taxi starts, the bus has already traveled ( 4 times (45 - 30) ) miles, because the bus is traveling 30 mph slower than the taxi. So the distance the bus has covered before the taxi starts is ( 4 times 15 = 60 ) miles. Now, since the taxi is traveling at 45 mph, and the bus is traveling at ( 45 - 30 = 15 ) mph, the taxi is closing the gap at a rate of ( 45 - 15 = 30 ) mph. To find out how long it takes for the taxi to close a 60-mile gap at 30 mph, we use the formula: [ text{Time} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Speed}} ] So for the taxi to catch up to the bus: [ t = frac{60}{30} ] [ t = 2 text{ hours} ] Therefore, the taxi will overtake the bus boxed{2} hours after it starts."},{"prompt":"Yvonne brings a box of chocolates to school.

Since Alice only eats caramel-filled chocolates, the number of caramel-filled chocolates left is ( frac{C}{3} - 6 ). Bob eats 4 chocolates without nuts or caramel.

Since one rabbit can clear 10 square yards per day, 100 rabbits can clear: 100 rabbits * 10 square yards/rabbit/day = 1000 square yards/day Over 20 days, the total area cleared would be: 1000 square yards/day * 20 days = 20,000 square yards Now we have the total area cleared and the width of the plot in yards.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Partitioning E into Pairs:** Consider partitioning set (E) into 100 pairs: [ {1, 200}, {2, 199}, ldots, {100, 101} ] 2. **Applying Property (1):** By property (1), for any (a_i in G), its corresponding pair (b_i = 201 - a_i) cannot be in (G): [ a_i + b_i = 201 ] Thus, each (a_i) in (G) is paired with (b_i notin G). 3. **Sum of E and Pair Sums:** The sum of all elements in (E) is: [ sum_{i=1}^{200} i = frac{200(200+1)}{2} = 20100 ] Writing this as parted sums: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i + sum_{i=1}^{100} b_i = 20100 ] 4. **Using Property (2):** Given (sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i = 10080): [ sum_{i=1}^{100} b_i = 20100 - 10080 = 10020 ] 5. **Calculating the Sum of Squares:** - The square sum of elements in (E): [ sum_{i=1}^{200} i^2 = frac{200 cdot 201 cdot 401}{6} = 2686700 ] - Based on the pairings: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} b_i = 201 - a_i ] [ sum_{i=1}^{100} b_i^2 = sum_{i=1}^{100} (201 - a_i)^2 ] Expanding the square: [ (201 - a_i)^2 = 201^2 - 2 cdot 201 cdot a_i + a_i^2 ] Summing from (i = 1) to 100: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} b_i^2 = sum_{i=1}^{100} (201^2 - 402a_i + a_i^2) = 100 cdot 201^2 - 402 sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i + sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 ] Substituting known values: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} b_i^2 = 100 cdot 40401 - 402 cdot 10080 + sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 = 4040100 - 4040160 + sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 ] - Simplifying: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} b_i^2 = sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 - 60 ] Given: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 + sum_{i=1}^{100} b_i^2 = 2686700 ] We know: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} b_i^2 = sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 - 60 ] Solving these sum equations: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 + (sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 - 60) = 2686700 ] Thus simplifying: [ 2 sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 - 60 = 2686700 2 sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 = 2686760 sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i^2 = 1349380 ] 6. **Checking Modulo 4:** Seeing when (a_i) is odd, (a_i^2) modulo 4 is 1. For even (a_i), (a_i^2) is a multiple of 4.

After moving m marbles, both jars will have an equal number of marbles. Therefore, the new number of marbles in Jar X will be x + m, and the new number of marbles in Jar Y will be 1.10x - m. Since both jars will have an equal number of marbles after the transfer, we can set the two expressions equal to each other: x + m = 1.10x - m Now, we can solve for m: 2m = 1.10x - x 2m = 0.10x m = 0.05x This means that the number of marbles moved from Jar Y to Jar X is 5% of the original number of marbles in Jar X.

Assuming Kelvin is infinitely intelligent, what is the minimum number of hops he will need to guarantee reaching the other side?","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem**: - Kelvin must hop on 10 lilypads in a specific order to cross the river. - The correct order is unknown to Kelvin. - If Kelvin hops to the wrong lilypad, he must start over. 2. **Determine the number of hops needed**: - We can consider the number of hops needed to determine the correct lilypad at each step. 3. **Calculate the maximum hops needed for each lilypad**: - For the first lilypad (i=1), Kelvin needs to try all 10 possible positions, so he needs (1 times (10-1) = 9) hops. - For the second lilypad (i=2), Kelvin needs to try 9 possible positions, so he needs (2 times (10-2) = 16) hops. - Generalizing this, the number of hops needed to determine the i-th lilypad is (i times (10-i)). 4. **Summing up the hops for all lilypads**: - ( sum_{i=1}^{10} i(10-i) ). - It's better to evaluate this in steps: [ sum_{i=1}^{10} i(10-i) = 1 cdot 9 + 2 cdot 8 + 3 cdot 7 + 4 cdot 6 + 5 cdot 5 + 6 cdot 4 + 7 cdot 3 + 8 cdot 2 + 9 cdot 1 + 10 cdot 0 ] Simplify the products: [ = 9 + 16 + 21 + 24 + 25 + 24 + 21 + 16 + 9 + 0 ] Sum up the values: [ 9 + 16 + 21 + 24 + 25 + 24 + 21 + 16 + 9 = 165 ] Therefore, the sum of the hops is: [ sum_{i=1}^{10} i(10-i) = 165 ] 5. **Add the final hops to cross the river**: - After determining the order, Kelvin needs 10 additional hops to actually cross the 10 lilypads. - However, the reference solution mentions 11 hops. This extra hop can be interpreted as possibly validating each step or hopping from the starting point, making it consistent with his calculations. 6. **Total minimum number of hops**: [ text{Total hops} = 165 + 11 = 176 ] # Conclusion: Thus, the minimum number of hops Kelvin will need to guarantee reaching the other side is ( boxed{176} )."},{"prompt":"Factor 64 16y^2.","completion":"Start by identifying the expression as a difference of squares: 64 - 16y^2 We can rewrite this as: 8^2 - (4y)^2 Applying the difference of squares formula a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b), we have: (8 - 4y)(8 + 4y) Each term in the factors can be simplified by factoring out a 4: 4(2 - y) cdot 4(2 + y) So, the factored form of the expression is: 16(2 - y)(2 + y) Conclusion: boxed{16(2-y)(2+y)}"},{"prompt":"Let [ z = frac{(5 + 7i)^3 cdot (16 3i)^4}{2 + 5i}, ] and let (w = frac{overline{z}}{z}).

This can be shown through the following configurations for n = 1, 2, 3: - For n=1: The single blue cell has 4 liberties. - For n=2: The two adjacent blue cells share one edge, so they have 3 + 3 - 2 = 4 liberties. - For n=3: The three blue cells in an L-shape configuration have a total of 6 + 4 - 2 = 8 liberties. - Since Ruby colors exactly 2n cells red after Blake's n blue cells, Ruby cannot block every liberty for n leq 3 (because 2n < 2n + 1). 3. **Termination**: - Therefore, Blake's strategy will only terminate when n geq 4. Blake will be able to achieve a score of at least 4 before they cannot proceed any further. 4. **Ruby's Blocking Strategy**: - Ruby can prevent Blake from achieving more than 4 squares by using the following partition strategy: - Divide the grid into 2 times 2 squares (called windows). - On Ruby's turn, if Blake places a blue cell c inside a window, Ruby places her two red cells in the remaining orthogonal neighbors of c within the same window. 5. **Proof of Ruby's Blocking Strategy**: - This strategy ensures that no window will have two orthogonally adjacent blue cells: - If there were two orthogonally adjacent blue cells in a window, then the first blue cell would lead Ruby to place the necessary red cells, preventing the second blue cell from being placed. 6. **Upper Bound**: - This results in Blake being able to place at most 4 blue cells. Any blue cell cannot form a polygon larger than the 2 times 2 window due to the surrounding red cells. - Consider a window with the blue cell w in the southeast corner, and the cells x, y, and z in the remaining positions (forming a 2 times 2 square).

The radii of the circles ( R ) and ( r ) form the segments from the centers of the circles to the point of tangency, which are perpendicular to the common tangent. 3. **Constructing the Triangle:** Place the centers of the two circles, denoted ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ), such that the distance ( O_1O_2 = R + r ). Let ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) be the points of tangency on the two circles.

Using the properties of the ellipse and tangent lines, we know that: [ angle P O Q = 2p + q ] 4.

With our notation, alpha + beta = frac{1}{2} (angle P F_1 Q + angle P F_2 Q). 6. Therefore, putting it all together, we have: [ angle P O Q = pi - frac{1}{2} (alpha + beta) = pi - frac{1}{2} (angle P F_1 O + angle P F_2 O) ] Thus, we have shown: [ angle P O Q = pi - frac{1}{2}left( angle P F_{1} O + angle P F_{2} O right) quad blacksquare ] # Part (b): 1.

Subtract the second inequality from the first: [ (a x_{1}^{2} + b x_{1} + c) - (-a x_{2}^{2} - b x_{2} - c) leqslant 2000. ] Simplifying this gives: [ a (x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}) + b (x_{1} + x_{2}) + 2c leqslant 2000. ] 6. Reformulate the above as: [ left(x_{1} - x_{2}right)left[aleft(x_{1} + x_{2}right) + bright] leqslant 2000. ] 7. Since (x_{1}) and (x_{2}) are integers and (x_{1} > x_{2}), it follows that: [ x_{1} geq x_{2} + 1. ] 8. Therefore: [ aleft(x_{1} + x_{2}right) + b geq aleft(x_{2} + 1 + x_{2}right) + b = a + 2a x_{2} + b. ] 9. Given that (2a x_{2} + b geq 0), we have: [ a + 2a x_{2} + b geq a > 2000. ] 10. Combining steps 6 and 9, we achieve: [ (x_{1} - x_{2})left[a(x_{1} + x_{2}) + bright] > 2000. ] 11. This contradicts the inequality in step 6. # Conclusion Since assuming the existence of three different integers (x_1, x_2, x_3) leads to a contradiction, we conclude that there can be at most two integers (x) such that: [ left|a x^{2}+b x+cright| leqslant 1000. ] (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Find the number of vertical asymptotes for the function ( y = frac{x+2}{x^2 4} ).","completion":"1. **Factorize the denominator:** The denominator ( x^2 - 4 ) can be factorized using the difference of squares formula: [ x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2) ] 2. **Identify potential points for vertical asymptotes:** Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero but not canceled by the numerator.

Construct a set of points ( P_1, P_2, P_3, ldots ) such that ( P_{k+1} ) is the image of ( P_k ) under a rotation centered at ( A_{k+1} ) through ( 120^circ ) clockwise for ( k = 0, 1, 2, ldots ). Prove that if ( P_{1986} = P_0 ), then the triangle ( A_1 A_2 A_3 ) is equilateral. Steps: 1. **Define the Sequence:** According to the problem, consider points ( P_k ) such that: [ P_{k+1} = R(A_{k+1}, 120^circ)P_k ] where ( R(A_{k+1}, 120^circ) ) represents a rotation about ( A_{k+1} ) by ( 120^circ ) clockwise. 2. **Identify the Pattern:** Notice the cyclical nature of the points ( A_{k+1} ): [ A_{k+1} = A_{(k mod{3}) + 1} ] 3. **Rotation Cycle:** There are ( 3 ) points, and after rotating ( 1986 ) times, we observe that: [ 1986 div 3 = 662 implies 1986 = 3 times 662 ] Therefore, after every ( 3 ) rotations, we complete one full cycle. 4. **Effect of Three Successive Rotations:** Consider the effect of three successive rotations: [ P_{k+3} = R(A_{k+3}, 120^circ) R(A_{k+2}, 120^circ) R(A_{k+1}, 120^circ) P_k ] Since ( A_{k+1}, A_{k+2}, A_{k+3} ) correspond to ( A_1, A_2, A_3 ), this product of rotations forms a translation if the triangle is not equilateral. For ( 1986 ) rotations to bring ( P_{1986} = P_0 ), the overall transformation must be the identity. 5. **Translation versus Identity:** If the triangle is not equilateral, the composition of three ( 120^circ ) rotations corresponds to a net translation (not identity). Only if the triangle ( A_1A_2A_3 ) is equilateral, do we get: [ R(A_3, 120^circ) R(A_2, 120^circ) R(A_1, 120^circ) = text{Identity} ] Thus, forcing ( P_{1986} = P_0 ) implies ( A_1, A_2, A_3 ) form an equilateral triangle. 6. **Verifying with Coordinates:** Suppose we need to confirm it with coordinates.

Boys interpreted the question as referring only to their male classmates, whereas girls understood it correctly to mean all classmates. Step-by-step analysis Step 1: Establish possible number of boys: Firstly, we identify the genders of the listed names where possible, except for Sasha, whose gender is undetermined. - Boys: Vanya, Dima, Egor, Lesha - Girls: Inna, Tanya Thus, the possible values for the number of boys at the club are either 4 (if Sasha is a girl) or 5 (if Sasha is a boy). Step 2: Establish the conditions for their answers: Assuming all boys answered honestly, taking only boys into account: - If \\"Two,\\" then in their view, there are three boys in total (since they are considering themselves plus two more). - If \\"Three,\\" then in their view, there are four boys in total (since they are considering themselves plus three more).

Step 3: Look at the contradiction if boys come from different classes: If some boys come from different classes, they would observe other boys from the same class. But if each mentioned seeing \\"Three\\" boys, this implies another class also has at least three boys. Given the above: - Boys from class 1 would have observed 3 boys from their class. - Same logic applies to class 2. Thus, there would be a minimum of 6 boys, which contradicts our possible values of 4 or 5.

However, checking: - For 3 boys’ view, answer cannot be \\"Two\\" in this case (since they will always view at least 4 including themselves, unless they see fewer). Conclusion: It backs up the hypothesis that the boys’ number must follow the four-boys rule minus the misunderstanding part of question (thus deviating the case if seeing three).

In probability theory, an event with a non-zero probability (greater than 0 but less than 1) is a possible, albeit unlikely, event. Only an event with a probability of 0 is considered impossible. - Therefore, B is incorrect. - **Statement C**: Drawing a red ball from a bag containing only 5 red balls is described as a certain event.

Find the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that no matter how Starways establishes its flights, the cities can always be partitioned into ( k ) groups so that from any city it is not possible to reach another city in the same group by using at most 28 flights.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Conditions:** - The problem describes a country with 2016 cities. - Starways wants to establish one-way flights such that each city has exactly one outgoing flight. - We need to find the smallest number ( k ) such that the cities can always be partitioned into ( k ) groups, ensuring it is not possible to reach another city in the same group using at most 28 flights. 2. **Modeling the Problem:** - The flights form a directed graph ( G ) with 2016 vertices and each vertex having an out-degree of 1. - Each city corresponds to a vertex, and each flight corresponds to a directed edge from one vertex to another. 3. **Cycle Length Consideration:** - To find the lower bound on ( k ), consider if ( G ) contains a cycle of length 57. - In a cycle of length 57, any city (vertex) can reach any other city in the same cycle within at most 28 flights, which means all 57 cities in the cycle must be in different groups. - Thus, at least 57 groups are necessary to prevent reaching any city in the same group within 28 flights. 4. **Constructing Groups:** - Next, we need to show that 57 groups are sufficient. - Consider an auxiliary directed graph ( H ) where an edge exists from ( u ) to ( v ) if ( u ) can be reached from ( v ) using at most 28 flights. Each vertex in ( H ) has out-degree at most 28. 5. **Applying Induction:** - **Base Case**: For a graph with 1 vertex, the statement is trivially true as we only need one group. - **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for an ( n )-vertex graph: we can partition its vertices into at most 57 groups with no edges between vertices in the same group. 6. **Adding a New Vertex:** - Consider adding a new vertex ( v ) to this ( n )-vertex graph giving us an ( n+1 )-vertex graph. - Since each vertex in ( H ) has out-degree at most 28, ( v ) has at most 28 incoming and 28 outgoing edges. Therefore, ( v ) has at most 56 neighbors. - We can remove ( v ) and by the induction hypothesis, partition the remaining ( n ) vertices into at most 57 groups. - When re-adding ( v ), it will have at least one group among the 57 with no neighbors of ( v ). Place ( v ) in that group. 7. **Conclusion:** - By induction, a directed graph where each vertex has out-degree at most 28 can always be partitioned into 57 groups where no vertex in any group can reach another vertex in the same group within 28 flights. - Thus, the smallest number ( k ) such that it is possible to partition the cities into ( k ) groups while satisfying the condition is ( boxed{57} )."},{"prompt":"Both roots of the quadratic equation x^2 72x + k = 0 are prime numbers.

According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if you have more \\"pigeons\\" than \\"pigeonholes\\" and each pigeon must be placed in one hole, at least one hole must contain more than one pigeon. Here, the \\"pigeonholes\\" are the six equilateral triangles, and the \\"pigeons\\" are the 7 points. 4. By dividing the hexagon into 6 triangles, each can potentially hold the points.

Therefore, they have: [ m_1 equiv m_2 pmod{2} ] and [ n_1 equiv n_2 pmod{2} ] 4. **Multiplication of (a_1) and (a_2):** Consider the product (a_1 times a_2): [ a_1 times a_2 = (2^{m_1} cdot 3^{n_1}) times (2^{m_2} cdot 3^{n_2}) ] Simplifying this, we get: [ a_1 times a_2 = 2^{m_1 + m_2} cdot 3^{n_1 + n_2} ] 5. **Checking the Sum of Exponents:** Since (m_1) and (m_2) are both either odd or even, (m_1 + m_2) will be even. Similarly, (n_1 + n_2) will also be even. 6. **Conclusion about the Product:** Since both (m_1 + m_2) and (n_1 + n_2) are even, we can write: [ a_1 times a_2 = 2^{2p} cdot 3^{2q} quad text{for some integers } p text{ and } q. ] We recognize that: [ 2^{2p} cdot 3^{2q} = (2^p cdot 3^q)^2 ] which is a perfect square.

They each shoot at the nearest gangster or one of the nearest gangsters simultaneously. We need to determine the minimum possible number of gangsters who will be killed. 2. **Observation**: Since each gangster shoots at the nearest other gangster, each bullet is fired simultaneously, implying that a gangster can't avoid being shot by moving away. 3. **Symmetric Configuration**: Consider the square grid configuration. One logical approach is to position the gangsters on the vertices of another symmetric shape or in such a way where pairwise shooting minimizes kills. 4. **Pairs and Mutual Shooting**: To minimize the number of kills, we must pair up the gangsters strategically. If two gangsters shoot at each other, they will both die. 5. **Calculation**: - Let's start pairing up the gangsters. Since each pair will result in both gangsters dying, for 50 gangsters there will be at least: [ lceil frac{50}{2} rceil = 25 text{ gangsters killed} ] 6. **Minimization Insight**: However, because gangsters can also potentially aim at different directions or avoid optimal target alignment for maximal death, we can reduce this further. 7. **Unknown Details in Choice**: Given that each one simultaneously targets the nearest, theoretically speaking, any omission from this direct pairing could indeed save some gangsters if arranged optimally. Yet minimization below half indicates a computational setup or strategic insights that could anticipate closer targets shooting. 8. **Conclusion Reference Verification**: The reference answer presents a symmetry which ideally has a more distributed shot layout, highlighting a conclusion that the minimal number killed can indeed be tactically fewer: [ boxed{10} ]"},{"prompt":"Given ( x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n} > 0, n geq 5 ), show that frac{x_{1} x_{2}}{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+2 x_{3} x_{4}}+frac{x_{2} x_{3}}{x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+2 x_{4} x_{5}}+cdots+frac{x_{n} x_{1}}{x_{n}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+2 x_{2} x_{3}} leq frac{n1}{2}.","completion":"To show that: [ frac{x_{1}x_{2}}{x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2} + 2x_{3}x_{4}} + frac{x_{2}x_{3}}{x_{2}^{2} + x_{3}^{2} + 2x_{4}x_{5}} + cdots + frac{x_{n}x_{1}}{x_{n}^{2} + x_{1}^{2} + 2x_{2}x_{3}} leq frac{n - 1}{2}, ] First, divide both the numerator and denominator by the corresponding product of terms 2x_ix_{i+1}.

One vector (vec{a}) such that (|vec{s} + vec{a}| leqslant 1). 2. Two vectors (vec{b}) and (vec{c}) such that (|vec{s} + vec{b}| leqslant sqrt{2}) and (|vec{s} + vec{b} + vec{c}| leqslant 1). Proof of Lemma Assume that no such single vector (vec{a}) exists such that (angle (vec{a}, vec{s}) geqslant 120^circ ). This means for every vector, (vec{a}_i), the angle between (vec{a}_i) and (vec{s}) is less than (120^circ). We need to analyze the possibility of choosing two vectors. Since we can't choose one vector such that (|vec{s} + vec{a}| leqslant 1 ), due to the positioning on both sides of the line (OS), we need to consider the maximum angle vectors: [ text{Select two vectors such that } angle (vec{b}, vec{s}) text{ and } angle (vec{s}, vec{c}) text{ maximize the angle}. ] According to the given condition, we have (angle (vec{b}, vec{s})) and (angle (vec{s}, vec{c})): [ 90^circ < angle (vec{b}, vec{s}) < 120^circ ] We can infer: [ 180^circ < (angle (vec{b}, vec{s}) + angle (vec{s}, vec{c})) < 240^circ ] Hence, it holds that (angle (vec{b}, vec{c}) > 120^circ ). [ | vec{b} + vec{c} | < 1 text{ (since the largest possible angle results in less vector sum)} ] Thus: [ | vec{s} + vec{b} |< sqrt{2} ] And, [ | vec{s} + vec{b} + vec{c}| leqslant 1 ] This completes the proof of the lemma. General Case: When ( n geq 4 ): 1. Choose an arbitrary vector ( vec{a}_1 ). 2. Using the lemma, from the set of remaining vectors: - Either there exists a vector ( vec{a}_2 ) such that [ left| vec{a}_1 + vec{a}_2 right| leqslant 1 ] - Or, there exists vectors ( vec{a}_2 ) and ( vec{a}_3 ) such that [ left| vec{a}_1 + vec{a}_2 right| < sqrt{2} ] and [ left| vec{a}_1 + vec{a}_2 + vec{a}_3 right| leqslant 1. ] This process of adding vectors keeps the vector sum within the desired bounds iteratively. Conclusion: After performing the above steps iteratively for all ( n ) vectors, we confirm that for any ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n ), the sum of these ( k ) vectors has a length that does not exceed 2, proving the statement.

The retailer buys the pens at the market price of 36 pens, so the total cost for the retailer is 36P. The retailer then sells these pens at a 1% discount. This means the selling price per pen is P - 0.01P = 0.99P. The retailer's profit is given as 229.99999999999997% (which we can round to 230% for simplicity). Profit is calculated based on the cost price, so a 230% profit means the retailer earns 230% of the cost price in addition to the cost price itself. Let's denote the number of pens the retailer bought and sold as N. The total selling price for N pens is N * 0.99P, and the total cost price is 36P. The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. The profit can also be expressed as 230% of the cost price, which is 2.3 times the cost price.

His friend Emily borrowed 1/3 of the remaining oranges: ( 90 times frac{1}{3} = 30 ) oranges borrowed. 5. After Emily borrowed the oranges, Johann has: ( 90 - 30 = 60 ) oranges left. 6.

Since (int_0^1 f_1(x) , dx = 0), we can use the intermediate value theorem for integrals. Consider the function ( F(t) = int_0^t f_1(x) , dx ). Since ( F(0) = 0 ) and ( F(1) = 0 ), and ( F ) is continuous, for any (alpha in (0,1)), there exists ( t in [0,1] ) such that ( F(t) = 0 ).

For f(x) to be monotonically increasing, f'(x) geq 0 must hold, which gives us: 2ax - ln x - 1 geq 0 Simplifying, we get: 2a geq frac{ln x + 1}{x} 3.

Since g(x) is increasing on (0,1) and decreasing on (1, +infty), and considering g(frac{1}{e}) = 0, we conclude that for x in (0, frac{1}{e}), g(x) < 0, and for x in (frac{1}{e}, +infty), g(x) > 0. 4.

Plugging y_1 = frac{by_0 - 2pa}{y_0 - b} and y_2 = frac{2pa}{y_0}, we get: [ frac{(by_0 - 2pa)(2pa)}{(y_0 - b)y_0} = yleft(frac{by_0 - 2pa}{y_0 - b} + frac{2pa}{y_0}right) - 2px. ] Expression simplification: [ frac{2pa(by_0 - 2pa)}{(y_0 - b)y_0} = yleft(frac{by_0(y_0 - b) + (2pa)}{(y_0 - b)y_0}right) - 2px. ] To further simplify: [ 2paxy_0(by_0 - 2pa) = yleft(by_0 - 2pa + 2paright)(y_0 - b) - 2px(y_0 - b). ] Simplifying again: [ 2paxy_0(by_0 - 2pa) = y(by_0) - 2pyxa. ] Finally: [ (2px - by)y_0^2 + 2pb(a - x)y_0 + 2pa(by - 2pa) = 0. ] 5. **Solution Of System:** The above system simplifies further, identifying the fixed point by solving: [ left{ begin{array}{l} 2px - by = 0, a - x = 0, by - 2pa = 0. end{array} right. ] Solving the above: [ x = a, quad y = frac{2pa}{b}. ] # Conclusion: Thus, the fixed point through which the line (M_1M_2) always passes as (M) moves on the parabola is: [ boxed{left(a, frac{2pa}{b}right)} ]"},{"prompt":"a certain kingdom, there is only one type of transportation: the flying carpet.

Prove that it is possible to fly from the capital to the city of Distant (possibly with transfers).","completion":": 1. **Problem Restatement:** We are given a kingdom with three types of cities: a capital, a city named Dalniy, and the rest. The connections between them (flights) are such that: - From the capital, there are 21 flights. - From the city Dalniy, there is 1 flight. - From all other cities, there are 20 flights each. We need to prove that there exists a path (possibly with transfers) from the capital to Dalniy via the connectivities provided by these flights. 2. **Key Graph Theory Concept:** This problem can be represented as a graph where cities are vertices, and flights are edges. We need to show that there is a path in this graph from the vertex representing the capital to the vertex representing Dalniy. 3. **Assumption and Contradiction:** Assume for the sake of contradiction that there is no path from the capital to Dalniy. This would imply that in the graph, they belong to different connected components. 4. **Analysis of Connected Components:** Consider the connected component that includes the capital. - Since the capital has 21 edges (21 outgoing flights), it is a vertex with an odd degree. - All other cities except Dalniy have 20 edges each, implying they have even degrees. 5. **Odd and Even Degree Vertices:** The sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph is twice the number of edges, and hence is always even. Therefore, in any connected component: - The number of vertices with odd degrees must be even. Given: - Capital (odd degree - 21) - Other cities in the component (even degree - 20) This suggests the capital’s connected component must have at least one more odd degree vertex to satisfy the required condition of having an even count of odd degree vertices. 6. **Contradiction:** If Dalniy is not in the same connected component, the only remaining vertex with an odd degree (1) would not be accounted for in the capital’s component. An isolated vertex with an odd degree is not possible in a connected component as per our assumptions. Therefore, the initial assumption that capital and Dalniy are in different connected components must be false. This implies that they are in the same connected component, meaning there is a path from the capital to Dalniy. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{There exists a path from the capital to Dalniy, possibly with transfers.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Proposition P: For all x in mathbb{R}, cos x geq 1, then the negation of P is ( ) A: There exists an x in mathbb{R}, cos geq 1 B: For all x in mathbb{R}, cos x < 1 C: There exists an x in mathbb{R}, cos x < 1 D: For all x in mathbb{R}, cos x > 1","completion":"Since the negation of a universal proposition: \\"For all x in M, p(x)\\" is an existential proposition: \\"There exists an x in M, neg p(x)\\".

Between certain cities, there is either a bidirectional direct flight operated by a specific airline, or there is no direct flight. It is known that any two routes operated by the same airline share a common endpoint. Prove: The cities can be partitioned into k+2 groups such that no two cities within the same group are connected by a flight route. 1. **Base Case Verification (k = 0):** - When k = 0, there are no airlines, hence no flight routes between any cities. Consequently, each city can be its own group. Therefore, there are n such groups where n is the number of cities. - Clearly, the number of groups (n) is at least k + 2 when k = 0. 2. **Graph Construction:** - Construct a graph where the vertices represent the cities and the edges represent the flight routes. - Denote the edges corresponding to each airline by E_1, E_2, ldots, E_k. Each E_i represents the set of edges (routes) operated by the i-th airline. 3. **Observation on E_i:** - For each airline i in {1, 2, ldots, k}, the set of edges E_i either forms a triangle or forms a \\"star\\" structure. That is, all edges in E_i share a common endpoint, denoted as A. 4. **Removing Endpoint A:** - Consider if E_i forms a star with common vertex A.

Let these groups be B_1, B_2, ldots, B_n with n geq k+3. - Notice, with n groups, the graph should have at least {n choose 2} inter-group edges (since each pair of groups has at least one connecting edge), giving us: [ frac{n(n-1)}{2} geq frac{(k+3)(k+2)}{2} > 3k ] - This contradicts the edge count 3k.

These numbers are of the form (2^k) where (0 leq k leq 9). There are 10 such numbers, and each must be colored differently because each number is a divisor of the next one in the sequence. Therefore, we need at least 10 different colors: [ n geq 10 ] 2. **Claim that (n = 10) is sufficient:** We need to show that it is possible to color the numbers (1, 2, ldots, 1000) using exactly 10 colors such that no two numbers, where one is a divisor of the other, share the same color. 3. **Proof of the claim:** - Consider the intervals ([2^k, 2^{k+1} - 1]) for (0 leq k leq 9). Each interval contains numbers that are not divisors of each other. For example, the interval ([2^k, 2^{k+1} - 1]) contains numbers (2^k, 2^k + 1, ldots, 2^{k+1} - 2). None of these numbers divide each other because they are all less than (2^{k+1}) and greater than or equal to (2^k). - We can color all numbers in the interval ([2^k, 2^{k+1} - 1]) with the same color. Since there are 10 such intervals, we can use 10 different colors, one for each interval. 4. **Coloring the numbers:** - Assign a unique color to each number of the form (2^k) for (0 leq k leq 9). This uses 10 colors. - For any number (j) between 1 and 1000, there exists an (i) such that (2^i leq j < 2^{i+1}). If (j) is exactly (2^i), it gets the color assigned to (2^i). If (j) is in the interval ([2^i, 2^{i+1} - 1]), it gets the same color as (2^i). 5. **Verification:** - By construction, no two numbers where one is a divisor of the other will share the same color. This is because the only numbers that can be divisors of each other are those of the form (2^k), and each of these has a unique color. - All other numbers within the intervals ([2^k, 2^{k+1} - 1]) are colored the same, and none of these numbers divide each other.

The former is greater and the latter is smaller. This implies that if we measure the chord of a circle with a diameter of 7 units 22 times consecutively, the endpoint of the last chord will be close to the starting point of the first chord. Calculate the central angle corresponding to the arc between the starting and ending points. Similarly, carry out the calculations starting from the approximation frac{223}{71}. Based on these calculations, can we determine which of the two approximations is better? (Only a fourdigit logarithm table can be used; it is advisable to calculate using the lg sin table because the difference between adjacent data in that table is larger.)","completion":": 1. Let us denote the smaller central angle corresponding to the chord equal to the frac{1}{7} of the diameter by alpha. We know that: [ sin alpha = frac{1}{7} ] 2. To find alpha, we use the logarithm to obtain: [ lg sin alpha = 9.1549 - 10 ] Using the tables, we find: [ alpha approx 8.213^circ ] 3. The central angle corresponding to one chord is 2alpha. Thus, the total rotation after measuring 22 chords is: [ 44 alpha = 44 times 8.213^circ approx 361.4^circ ] This implies that the endpoint is ahead of the starting point by: [ 361.4^circ - 360^circ = 1.4^circ ] Therefore, the endpoint is 1.4^circ away from the starting point. 4. Now, considering the approximation frac{223}{71}, we measure the frac{1}{71} part of the diameter 223 times. Denoting the corresponding smaller central angle by beta, we get: [ sin beta = frac{1}{71} ] 5. Using logarithms: [ lg sin beta = 8.1487 - 10 ] Referring to the tables, we find: [ beta approx 0.8070^circ ] 6. The central angle for one chord is 2beta. Thus, the total rotation after measuring 223 chords is: [ 446 beta = 446 times 0.8070^circ approx 359.9^circ ] This implies that the endpoint is short of the starting point by: [ 360^circ - 359.9^circ = 0.1^circ ] Therefore, the endpoint is 0.1^circ away from the starting point. 7. From the above results, we observe that boxed{frac{22}{7}} exceeds pi since we surpassed the starting point, and boxed{frac{223}{71}} is less than pi as we did not complete a full circle. However, deciding the better approximation based solely on this approach is challenging, as both differences are minimal. 8. The frac{22}{7} approximation yields a final angle of 1.4^circ past the start, indicating it to be slightly over pi. In contrast, the frac{223}{71} approximation approaches pi more closely by ending up 0.1^circ short, suggesting a potential closer value to pi. Conclusively, the boxed{frac{223}{71}} is somewhat considered the better approximation due to its slightly lesser deviation from the actual value of pi."},{"prompt":"Compute sin 45^circ.","completion":"To compute sin 45^circ, we consider a geometric approach using the unit circle. 1. **Identify the Point on the Unit Circle**: Let P be the point on the unit circle that corresponds to an angle of 45^circ from the positive x-axis. 2. **Construct a Right Triangle**: Draw a line from P perpendicular to the x-axis, meeting the x-axis at point D. This forms a right triangle POD, where O is the origin. 3. **Recognize the Triangle Type**: Since the angle at O is 45^circ, and the angle at D is a right angle, triangle POD is a 45-45-90 triangle. 4. **Determine Side Lengths**: In a 45-45-90 triangle, the lengths of the legs are equal, and if the hypotenuse is 1 (as it is the radius of the unit circle), then each leg has a length of frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

Therefore, ( P, Q, D, A ) lie on a circle with diameter ( AD ).

Since (AB perp CD), line (AB) acts as the perpendicular bisector for all the circumferences involving (D). - Similarly, the intersection of circles ( Gamma_{CD} ) and ( Gamma_{DE} ) is line (AB), ensuring concyclicity of their points. 5. **Inversion Transformation:** - To validate using inversion, consider the inversion transformation (denoted by ( h )) centered at point ( D ) with some radius ( r ).

( mathrm{T} ) is the midpoint of ( mathrm{NC} ) and ( mathrm{P} ) is the midpoint of ( mathrm{BM} ). We need to find the length ( mathrm{PT} ). **First Method:** 1. We need to express the vector ( overrightarrow{PT} ) in terms of vectors ( overrightarrow{MC} ) and ( overrightarrow{NC} ). 2. Note that [ overrightarrow{AP} = frac{1}{2}(overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{AM}) ] and [ overrightarrow{AT} = frac{1}{2}(overrightarrow{AN} + overrightarrow{AC}) ] 3. Since ( overrightarrow{AM} = overrightarrow{AC} - overrightarrow{MC} ) and ( overrightarrow{AN} = overrightarrow{AB} - overrightarrow{NB} ), we obtain: [ overrightarrow{AP} = frac{1}{2}(overrightarrow{AB} + overrightarrow{AC} - overrightarrow{MC}) ] and [ overrightarrow{AT} = frac{1}{2}(overrightarrow{AB} - overrightarrow{NB} + overrightarrow{AC}) ] 4.

What percentage of the cars have valid tickets?","completion":"Let's denote the percentage of cars with valid tickets as P. Since 1/5th of that number have permanent parking passes, the percentage of cars with permanent parking passes would be P/5. We know that there are 300 cars in the parking lot, and 30 people tried to park without paying. Therefore, the total percentage of cars that either have valid tickets or permanent parking passes is the remaining cars after excluding the 30 that did not pay. So, the number of cars that have either valid tickets or permanent parking passes is 300 - 30 = 270 cars. Now, let's express the total percentage of cars with valid tickets and permanent parking passes in terms of P: P + P/5 = Total percentage of cars with valid tickets or permanent parking passes. To find the total percentage, we divide the number of cars with valid tickets or permanent parking passes (270) by the total number of cars (300) and multiply by 100: (270 / 300) * 100 = 90% Now we can solve for P: P + P/5 = 90 Multiplying through by 5 to eliminate the fraction: 5P + P = 450 6P = 450 P = 450 / 6 P = 75 Therefore, boxed{75%} of the cars have valid tickets."},{"prompt":"Johann and four friends are to deliver 250 pieces of certified mail.

The number of divisors of ( n ) is given by ( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) cdots (a_r + 1) ).

Let ( x = frac{p}{q} ) where ( gcd(p, q) = 1 ) and ( q > p > 0 ). There exist integers ( r ) and ( s ) such that ( q mid 10^s(10^r - 1) ). Let ( s = max { e_2(q), e_5(q) } ), where ( e_p(n) ) is the maximal exponent of ( p ) dividing ( n ). Let ( g = frac{q}{2^{e_2(q)} 5^{e_5(q)}} ), so ( q mid 10^s(10^r - 1) iff g mid 10^r - 1 ). Choose ( r = phi(g) ), where ( phi ) is Euler's totient function. Thus, ( q mid 10^s(10^r - 1) ). Let ( k = frac{10^s(10^r - 1)}{q} ). Then ( x = frac{p cdot k}{q cdot k} ). Define the digits ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_t ) of ( p cdot k ) so that ( p cdot k = d_1d_2ldots d_t ). Then ( x = frac{d_1d_2ldots d_t}{99ldots 99} ) with ( t ) nines. Hence, ( x = 0.d_1d_2ldots d_t d_1d_2ldots d_t ldots ), showing a periodic decimal representation. 3. We want to prove that the number ( x = 0.a_1a_2a_3ldots ) is irrational. Assume, for contradiction, that ( x ) is rational. By Lemma 2, the sequence ( a_1, a_2, ldots ) is periodic. Let ( n ) be its period, meaning ( a_k = a_{n+k} ) for all ( k in mathbb{N} ). 4. Since ( a_1 = 1 ), it follows that ( a_{kn+1} = 1 ) for all ( k in mathbb{N} ). By Lemma 1, ( 1, n+1, 2n+1, 3n+1, ldots ) must all be perfect squares. 5. Consider ( kn+1 = m^2 ) for some ( k ). Then ( (m+1)^2 = m^2 + 2m + 1 > m^2 + n = (k+1)n + 1 ). Thus, ( (k+1)n + 1 ) lies between two squares, ( m^2 ) and ( (m+1)^2 ), and cannot be a square. Therefore, ( a_{(k+1)n+1} = 0 ), contradicting the periodicity of ( a_1, a_2, ldots ). 6. This contradiction implies that our assumption that ( x ) is rational is false.

Suppose 2n points are given in the plane, no three of which are collinear. Suppose n of the given 2n points are colored blue and the other n colored red. A line in the plane is called a balancing line if it passes through one blue and one red point and, for each side of the line, the number of blue points on that side is equal to the number of red points on the same side. Prove that there exist at least two balancing lines.","completion":"To prove that there exist at least two balancing lines, we will consider two cases based on the distribution of colors on the convex hull of the given 2n points. Case 1: The convex hull contains both red and blue points. 1. **Convex Hull Analysis**: Consider the convex hull of the 2n points. By definition, the convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that can contain all the points. 2. **Edge Property**: If the convex hull contains both red and blue points, then there must be at least one edge of the convex hull that connects a red point to a blue point. This is because the convex hull, being a polygon, will have vertices of alternating colors at some point if both colors are present. 3. **Balancing Line Construction**: For each such edge that connects a red point to a blue point, draw a line through these two points. This line divides the plane into two half-planes. 4. **Counting Points on Either Side**: Since no other points of the set lie on this line (as no three points are collinear), and the line passes through one red and one blue point, the remaining 2n-2 points are split evenly across the two half-planes. There are n-1 blue points and n-1 red points left, which must also be evenly distributed across the two half-planes for the line to be a balancing line. 5. **Existence of Two Lines**: Since a convex polygon with vertices of at least two colors must have at least two such edges (one following the other in the cyclic order of the polygon vertices), there are at least two balancing lines. Case 2: The convex hull is monochromatic (assume WLOG it is blue). 1. **Initial Setup**: Assume without loss of generality that all vertices of the convex hull are blue. The red points are all inside the convex hull. 2. **Line Rotation Method**: Fix a blue point on the convex hull and consider a line that rotates around this point. Initially, this line does not pass through any other point. 3. **Tracking Changes**: As the line rotates, it will sequentially encounter other points. Define x as the difference between the number of red and blue points on one side of the line. 4. **Initial and Final Values of x**: Initially, x = 0 (since the line passes through no points other than the pivot). As the line completes a rotation to the next blue point on the convex hull, x changes by +1 for each blue point and -1 for each red point it crosses. 5. **Zero Crossing**: By the Intermediate Value Theorem, since x starts at 0 and must return to 0 (upon completing the rotation back to the starting point), and changes sign as it encounters points, x must cross zero at least once between any two blue points on the convex hull. Each zero crossing corresponds to a balancing line. 6. **Number of Balancing Lines**: Since the convex hull has at least three vertices (it is a polygon), and each segment between consecutive blue vertices involves a rotation where x crosses zero, there are at least as many balancing lines as there are vertices in the convex hull. Combining the results from both cases, we conclude that there are at least two balancing lines, as required. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"a large desert, an emergency vehicle is positioned at the crossing of two perpendicular roads.

Now consider the part of the box between the top of (X) and the bottom of (Y). - This part is not part of (X), (Y), or (Z) and must belong to at least another brick (K). - Then, analyze (K)'s overlapping projections with (Z) on the left or front face, cut appropriately to reduce contradiction, and eventually, one reaches a state making clear that the minimum configuration contradicts itself. Proof 2 (Suggested by Olympiad participant Alexander Skutin): 1. **Setup Coordinate System**: Introduce a coordinate system with the origin at one cube vertex and axes parallel to its edges. 2. **Concept of Projections**: Instead of projections onto faces, we'll consider projections onto the coordinate planes (named as the bottom, front, and left). 3. **Preliminary Observation**: - Any two cuboids can overlap in projection on at most one plane. If they overlapped in projection on two planes, their projections on all three axes would overlap, leading to a physical overlap. 4. **Contradiction Approach**: - Suppose there exists a set of three cuboids (A), (B), and (C) such that the projections of each pair overlap on a different coordinate plane. - Then, argue using the minimal sum of distances between pairs (a) (between (B) and (C)), (b) (between (A) and (C)), and (c) (between (A) and (B)). Consider the minimal violating configuration. 5. **Cases**: - **Case 1**: If (a + b + c = 0). All three cuboids share a common point, which leads to contradictions, considering the uncovered octants with vertices at this common point must be collectively covered by other bricks (D) and (E). Still, their projections in these octants contradict the problem statement. - **Case 2**: If (a + b + c > 0). Consider specific distances (a, b), and (c) not being zero and argue with overlapping projections reduction approach. Reduction by cutting the boxes as per the lesser sum of distances yields smaller counterexamples, contradicting our minimal choice. 6. **Final Conclusion**: - Thus, we reach a contradiction in both cases, concluding that there can be no such set of three cuboids violating the problem's condition. Therefore, in any setup, for any given three cuboids within a divided cube, there will exist a face in the cube where the projections of any pair of these three cuboids do not overlap.

A: Both pens are black ballpoint pens B: One pen is black and one pen is blue C: Both pens are red ballpoint pens D: Exactly one pen is black","completion":"To solve this problem, let's first identify the total number of ways to select 2 pens out of 6. Since the pens are distinct, we can use combinations. The total number of ways to select 2 pens from 6 is given by the combination formula C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. For our case, n=6 and k=2, so the total number of ways to select 2 pens is: [C(6, 2) = frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1} = 15] Now, let's evaluate each of the given options: A: The probability that both pens are black. There are 3 black pens, so the number of ways to choose 2 black pens is C(3, 2) = frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = 3. Thus, the probability is frac{3}{15} = frac{1}{5}. B: The probability that one pen is black and one pen is blue. Since there are 3 black pens and 1 blue pen, the number of ways to choose 1 black and 1 blue pen is simply the product of the number of black pens and the number of blue pens, which is 3 times 1 = 3. Thus, the probability is frac{3}{15} = frac{1}{5}. C: The probability that both pens are red. There are 2 red pens, so the number of ways to choose 2 red pens is C(2, 2) = frac{2!}{2!(2-2)!} = 1. Thus, the probability is frac{1}{15}. D: The probability that exactly one pen is black. This can happen in two ways: selecting one black pen and one non-black pen.

Let's calculate the total number of hours the car was used: Total hours = hours used by A + hours used by B + hours used by C Total hours = 7 + 8 + 11 Total hours = 26 hours Now, let's find out the fraction of the total time that B used the car: Fraction of time used by B = hours used by B / Total hours Fraction of time used by B = 8 / 26 Fraction of time used by B = 4 / 13 (simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2) Now, let's apply this fraction to the total cost to find out B's share: B's share of hire charges = Total cost * Fraction of time used by B B's share of hire charges = 520 * (4 / 13) B's share of hire charges = 520 * 4 / 13 B's share of hire charges = 2080 / 13 B's share of hire charges = Rs. 160 Therefore, B paid Rs. boxed{160} for the car hire."},{"prompt":"the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, a_1 + a_5 = 16, then S_5 =( ) A: 80 B: 40 C: 31 D: 31","completion":"Since in the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, a_1 + a_5 = 16, Then S_5 = frac{5}{2}(a_1 + a_5) = frac{5}{2} times 16 = 40.

Integrate the (y)-component with respect to (y): [ frac{partial varphi}{partial y} = y^2 implies varphi = int y^2 , dy = frac{y^3}{3} + h(x, z), ] where (h(x, z)) is an arbitrary function of (x) and (z). 3. Integrate the (z)-component with respect to (z): [ frac{partial varphi}{partial z} = z^2 implies varphi = int z^2 , dz = frac{z^3}{3} + k(x, y), ] where (k(x, y)) is an arbitrary function of (x) and (y). Combining these results, we can write: [ varphi(x, y, z) = frac{x^3}{3} + frac{y^3}{3} + frac{z^3}{3} + C, ] where (C) is an arbitrary constant. Thus, the potential function for the vector field (mathbf{a}) is: [ varphi(x, y, z) = frac{x^3}{3} + frac{y^3}{3} + frac{z^3}{3} + C. ] Therefore, the vector field (mathbf{a}) is potential.

Since half of the kids are going to soccer camp, we calculate this as follows: [ frac{2000}{2} = 1000 ] This means there are 1000 kids going to soccer camp. Next, we need to find out how many of these kids are going to soccer camp in the morning. Given that 1/4 of the kids going to soccer camp are attending in the morning, we calculate: [ frac{1000}{4} = 250 ] Therefore, 250 kids are going to soccer camp in the morning. To find out how many kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon, we subtract the number of kids going in the morning from the total number of kids going to soccer camp. Since 1/4 are going in the morning, this implies that 3/4 are going in the afternoon. We can also calculate this by understanding that the remaining kids, after subtracting those who attend in the morning, are going in the afternoon. Thus, we have: [ 1000 - 250 = 750 ] Alternatively, calculating directly from the total, we get: [ 1000 times frac{3}{4} = 750 ] This shows that 750 kids are going to soccer camp in the afternoon.

Since the trains are of equal length and the faster train is overtaking the slower one, we can calculate the relative speed at which the faster train is catching up to the slower train. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds because they are moving in the same direction. Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 46 km/hr - 36 km/hr Relative speed = 10 km/hr To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. We use the conversion factor that 1 km/hr is equal to 5/18 m/s. Relative speed in m/s = 10 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed in m/s = (10 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed in m/s = (50/18) m/s Relative speed in m/s = 2.777... m/s (approximately) Now, we know that the faster train takes 18 seconds to completely pass the slower train.

Since 1452 already has a 3 in its prime factorization, we need to multiply it by another 3^2 to get a 3^3. Similarly, since 1452 does not have a 13 in its prime factorization, we need to multiply it by 13^3 to get a 13^3 factor. So, the smallest possible value of w that would give us both 3^3 and 13^3 as factors is: w = 3^2 * 13^3 Now, let's calculate w: w = 3^2 * 13^3 = 9 * 2197 = 19773 However, you mentioned that the smallest possible value of w is 468, which is not equal to 19773.

For Triangle A: - The base angles are 40 degrees each, so the vertical angle is 180 - 2 * 40 = 100 degrees. - Let the sides of the triangle be in the ratio 3x for the equal sides and the base be 3y. For Triangle B: - The base angles are 50 degrees each, so the vertical angle is also 100 degrees (since the vertical angles are equal). - Let the sides of the triangle be in the ratio 5x for the equal sides and the base be 5y. Since the vertical angles are equal, the triangles are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity postulate. This means that the ratio of their corresponding heights will be the same as the ratio of their corresponding sides. The ratio of the side lengths is given as 3:5, so the ratio of the heights will also be 3:5. However, let's verify this with the given area ratio to ensure consistency. The area of an isosceles triangle can be calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * base * height For Triangle A, let's denote the height as h_A, and for Triangle B, let's denote the height as h_B. The ratio of their areas is given as 9:25. Using the area formula, we can write: (1/2) * 3y * h_A / (1/2) * 5y * h_B = 9 / 25 Simplifying, we get: 3h_A / 5h_B = 9 / 25 Cross-multiplying gives us: 75h_A = 45h_B Dividing both sides by 15h_A gives us: 5h_A = 3h_B Dividing both sides by 3h_B gives us: h_A / h_B = 3 / 5 So, the ratio of their corresponding heights is indeed boxed{3:5,} which is consistent with the ratio of their side lengths and the given area ratio."},{"prompt":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is a geometric sequence, and a_3 cdot a_7 = 2a_5, let the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence {b_n} be S_n.

Each cell in the grid can either be ( +1 ) or ( -1 ). We need to consider the product of numbers in ( n ) different cells that are all in different rows and different columns. This product is defined as a basic term. 2. **Total Number of Basic Terms**: Since there are ( n ) rows and ( n ) columns, the total number of ways to choose ( n ) different cells in different rows and columns is ( n! ). Therefore, there are ( n! ) basic terms. 3. **Contribution of Each Cell**: Let ( a_{ij} ) represent the number in the ( i )-th row and ( j )-th column, where ( a_{ij} ) is either ( +1 ) or ( -1 ). Each ( a_{ij} ) will appear in exactly ( (n-1)! ) basic terms because there are ( (n-1)! ) ways to choose one cell from each of the remaining ( n-1 ) rows and ( n-1 ) columns. 4. **Product of All Basic Terms**: Consider the product of all ( n! ) basic terms: [ G_1 cdot G_2 cdot cdots cdot G_{n!} = left( prod_{1 leq i, j leq n} a_{ij} right)^{(n-1)!}. ] 5. **Simplification for ( n Geqslant 4 )**: Since ( (n-1)! ) is even for ( n geq 4 ), [ a_{ij}^{(n-1)!} = (+1)^{(n-1)!} quad text{or} quad (-1)^{(n-1)!} = 1. ] Hence, [ prod_{1 leq i, j leq n} a_{ij}^{(n-1)!} = 1. ] Therefore, [ G_1 cdot G_2 cdot cdots cdot G_{n!} = 1. ] 6. **Determination of Number of ( +1 )s and ( -1 )s**: Since the product of all basic terms is 1, the number of term combinations resulting in ( -1 ) must be even.
