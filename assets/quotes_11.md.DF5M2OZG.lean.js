Assume that ( C ) is a ( c )-gon (a polygon with ( c ) vertices). 2. **Case 1: Lines Not Containing Vertices of ( C ):** - If one of the lines in ( P ) contains none of the vertices of ( C ), then ( c = 2x ) is even (since the line must divide the vertices of ( C ) into two equal sets). - Each line that goes through a vertex ( A ) must also go through another vertex ( B ), with exactly ( x-1 ) vertices of ( C ) between ( A ) and ( B ) along the boundary of ( C ). Thus, there is at most one line through ( A ) and this line is the same as the one through ( B ). Therefore, there are at most ( x ) lines through the vertices of ( C ). - Each line ( Delta ) that does not contain a vertex of ( C ) must go through the interior of two opposite sides of ( C ), say ([AB]) and ([MP]), and ( Delta ) is their common perpendicular bisector. Thus, there are at most ( x ) such lines. Additionally, the other vertices of ( C ) can be paired such that ( Delta ) is the perpendicular bisector of each pair. Therefore, there are at most ( 2x leq n ) lines in ( P ). If equality occurs, then ( S = C ) (since ( 2x = n )), and the ( n ) points must be the vertices of a regular ( n )-gon. In this case, ( P ) is the set of all axes of symmetry of ( S ). 3. **Case 2: Lines Containing Vertices of ( C ):** - If each of the ( m ) lines contains at least one vertex of ( C ), then each line divides the ( n ) points into two sets with the same number of points. Thus, each vertex of ( C ) belongs to at most one of the lines. Therefore, there are at most ( c leq n ) lines in ( P ). If equality occurs, then ( S = C ) and each line contains exactly one of the points (otherwise, two points would define the same axis, and there would be fewer than ( n ) lines). Thus, ( n ) is odd. For each pair of vertices ( A ) and ( B ), there is exactly one vertex ( M ) such that the arcs ( AM ) and ( BM ) along the boundary of ( C ) contain the same number of vertices.

From this, we can find the radius of tank B: [ r_B = frac{10}{2pi} ] Now, let's substitute ( r_B ) into the equation for the capacities: [ pi r_C^2 cdot 10 = 0.8 cdot pi left(frac{10}{2pi}right)^2 cdot 8 ] Simplify the equation: [ r_C^2 = 0.8 cdot left(frac{10}{2pi}right)^2 cdot frac{8}{10} ] [ r_C^2 = 0.8 cdot frac{100}{4pi^2} cdot frac{4}{5} ] [ r_C^2 = frac{0.8 cdot 100 cdot 4}{4pi^2 cdot 5} ] [ r_C^2 = frac{0.8 cdot 100}{pi^2 cdot 5} ] [ r_C^2 = frac{80}{pi^2} ] Now, we can find ( r_C ): [ r_C = sqrt{frac{80}{pi^2}} ] [ r_C = frac{sqrt{80}}{pi} ] The circumference of tank C is ( 2pi r_C ): [ 2pi r_C = 2pi cdot frac{sqrt{80}}{pi} ] [ 2pi r_C = 2sqrt{80} ] [ 2pi r_C = 2sqrt{16 cdot 5} ] [ 2pi r_C = 2cdot 4sqrt{5} ] [ 2pi r_C = 8sqrt{5} ] So, the circumference of tank C is ( boxed{8sqrt{5}} ) meters."},{"prompt":"Consider the propositions p and q, where p: For all x in mathbb{R}, |x| + x geq 0, q: The equation x^2 + mx + 1 = 0 has real roots.

When x < 0, |x| = -x, thus |x| + x = -x + x = 0. In both cases, |x| + x geq 0. Therefore, proposition p is true and its negation is false.

For a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 to not have real roots, its discriminant must be negative: Delta = b^2 - 4ac < 0. In this case, b = m, a = 1, and c = 1, so our discriminant is: Delta = m^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 1 < 0, which simplifies to: m^2 - 4 < 0. Solving for m, we get: -2 < m < 2.

Define the function: [ f(x) = 2^{x} - arccos(x) ] 3. We observe that f(x) is an increasing function on the interval left( -frac{1}{2}, 1 right]. This is due to the properties of the functions (2^x) and (arccos(x)), where (2^x) is increasing, and (arccos(x)) is decreasing on this interval. 4. Therefore, the inequality (2^{x} - arccos(x) > a) implies that the smallest value of (f(x)) on the interval (left( -frac{1}{2}, 1 right]) must be greater than (a). 5.

We are given that C1 = Rs. 280. Since the total cost of both books is Rs. 480, we can find C2 by subtracting C1 from the total cost: C2 = Total cost - C1 C2 = Rs. 480 - Rs. 280 C2 = Rs. 200 We are also given that the second book was sold at a gain of 19%. Therefore, the selling price of the second book (SP2) can be calculated as follows: SP2 = C2 + (Gain% of C2) SP2 = C2 + (19/100 * C2) SP2 = C2 * (1 + 19/100) SP2 = Rs. 200 * (1 + 0.19) SP2 = Rs. 200 * 1.19 SP2 = Rs. 238 Since each book was sold at the same price, the selling price of the first book (SP1) is also Rs. 238.

Part 1: **If sqrt{(a-d)^{2}+4bc} is not extractable in p-arithmetic, then x_{p+1} = x_{0}** This part deals with the nature of the quadratic equation's discriminant. 1. We start with the given recursive function: [ x_{k} = f(x_{k-1}) = frac{ax_{k-1} + b}{cx_{k-1} + d} ] 2. Finding fixed points: A fixed point x must satisfy ( x = f(x) ). So, we solve: [ x = frac{ax + b}{cx + d} ] Rearrange this to form a quadratic equation: [ cx^2 + (d-a)x - b = 0 ] 3. The discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation is: [ Delta = (d-a)^2 + 4bc ] 4. If sqrt{(a-d)^2 + 4bc} is not extractable, it generally implies there are no real roots for the equation in a p-arithmetic context (i.e., the roots are imaginary or complex). 5. By Theorem 148: * If the function (f(x)) has no fixed points, the other points form cycles of equal length. 6. The length of any cycle must divide p + 1 per Task 150. 7. As there are no real ((p)-arithmetic) fixed points due to the non-extractability of the square root, each cycle must be of length p + 1. Thus, we conclude: [ x_{p+1} = x_0 ] Part 2: **If (a-d)^{2}+4bc=0, then x_{p}=x_{0}** 1. Given: ( (a-d)^2 + 4bc = 0 ) 2. This implies the discriminant Delta = 0, leading to repeated roots in the quadratic equation. 3. In this case, the function (f(x)) has exactly one fixed point ( x = frac{a-d}{2c} ). 4. According to Task 81: * The function forms cycles whose lengths divide ( p ). 5. Since Delta = 0, each point in the sequence results in a fixed cycle of length dividing p. Thus, we conclude: [ x_{p} = x_{0} ] Part 3: **If (a-d)^{2}+4bc neq 0 and sqrt{(a-d)^{2}+4bc} extractable in p-arithmetic, then x_{p-1}=x_{0}** 1. Assume ( (a-d)^2 + 4bc neq 0 ) but the square root is extractable. 2. The discriminant Delta is non-zero and extractable, hence the quadratic equation (cx^2 + (d-a)x - b = 0) has two distinct real fixed points. 3. These roots result in each point forming cycles of a specific length. 4. From Theorem 148: * Cycles of the function will have lengths dividing ( p - 1 ). Thus, we conclude: [ x_{p-1} = x_{0} ] In each scenario, the conclusion is derived from the discriminant of the quadratic equation formed by setting (x = f(x)) and the nature of fixed points. The cycle lengths are indicated by the divisors of (p+1), p, or (p-1) based on earlier results that rely on counting fixed points and their behavior.

Therefore, if all gnomes were truthful, the total number of hands raised would be equal to the number of gnomes, which is 10. 3. Each lying gnome, however, would raise their hand twice, because they lie about two flavors, claiming to like flavors different from their actual preference. 4. According to the problem, Snow White observes the following: - All gnomes raise their hands for the cream-flavored ice cream: 10 hands. - Half of the gnomes raise their hands for the chocolate-flavored ice cream: 5 hands. - Only one gnome raises their hand for the fruit-flavored ice cream: 1 hand. Therefore, the total number of hands raised is: [ 10 + 5 + 1 = 16 ] 5. Comparing this with the scenario where all gnomes were truthful (10 hands raised), we see there are 6 more hands raised than if all gnomes were truthful: [ 16 - 10 = 6 ] 6. Since each lying gnome raises one additional hand (compared to a truthful gnome), the 6 extra hands raised must come from lying gnomes: [ L = 6 ] 7.

This helps us understand the movement constraints for consecutive numbers. 2. **Consecutive numbers are adjacent**: Since consecutive numbers are adjacent along a row or a column, we can think of this as a walk around the chessboard where each step moves to an adjacent square. 3. **Diagonal elements**: We need to find the minimum sum of the numbers along the main diagonal of the 8 times 8 array. The main diagonal consists of the elements at positions (1,1), (2,2), ldots, (8,8). 4. **Parity of diagonal elements**: Notice that the numbers on the diagonal have the same parity. This is because the sum of the row and column indices for each diagonal element is always even (e.g., (1+1), (2+2), ldots, (8+8)). 5. **Minimum sum calculation**: To minimize the sum of the diagonal elements, we should place the smallest possible numbers on these positions. The smallest numbers with the same parity are the first eight odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15. 6. **Sum of the first eight odd numbers**: The sum of the first n odd numbers is given by the formula n^2. For n = 8: [ 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 8^2 = 64 ] 7. **Verification**: We need to ensure that these numbers can be placed consecutively in the array while maintaining the adjacency condition.

The goal is to move the knight from square ((1,1)) to square ((n,n)). 2. **Sum of Coordinates**: Observe that each knight move changes the sum (x + y) by (pm 3).

The prime factorization of 12 is 2^2 * 3^1. This means that the combinations of (a+1), (b+1), and (c+1) must multiply to give us 12. The possible combinations are: 1.

However, if a were 0, then x^a would be 1, and it would not contribute to the number of divisors since 1 is not a prime number. Therefore, we must look for the next smallest value for (a+1) that is greater than 1. The next smallest value for (a+1) is 2, which means the power of x in the product is a = 2 - 1 = 1.

Since a face of a cube is a square, each face has 4 vertices. The value of each face will also be ( pm 1 ) because the product of four ( pm 1 ) numbers is ( pm 1 ). 3. **Summing Values:** We need to sum the values of the 8 vertices and the 6 faces. Thus, we sum 14 numbers where each number is ( pm 1 ). 4. **Maximum Sum Calculation:** The maximum possible value of the sum is when all the values are ( +1 ).

Therefore, Ravi's efficiency is 70% (100% - 30%) of Sakshi's efficiency. Ravi's efficiency = 0.70 * (1/25) = 0.70/25 = 7/250 of the work per day. Combined efficiency of Sakshi, Tanya, and Ravi: To find the combined efficiency, we add the efficiencies of all three. Combined efficiency = Sakshi's efficiency + Tanya's efficiency + Ravi's efficiency Combined efficiency = (1/25) + (1/20) + (7/250) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 25, 20, and 250 is 250. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 250. Sakshi's efficiency = (1/25) = (10/250) Tanya's efficiency = (1/20) = (12.5/250) = (12.5 * 2)/(250 * 2) = (25/500) = (5/100) = (5 * 2.5)/(100 * 2.5) = (12.5/250) Ravi's efficiency = (7/250) Now, we can add them up: Combined efficiency = (10/250) + (12.5/250) + (7/250) Combined efficiency = (10 + 12.5 + 7) / 250 Combined efficiency = 29.5 / 250 Now, to find the number of days they would take to complete the work together, we take the reciprocal of the combined efficiency. Number of days = 1 / (Combined efficiency) Number of days = 1 / (29.5 / 250) Number of days = 250 / 29.5 Number of days ≈ 8.47 So, Sakshi, Tanya, and Ravi working together would take approximately boxed{8.47} days to complete the same piece of work."},{"prompt":"Determine all functions ( f: mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N} ) such that for every natural number ( n ), [ f(f(n)) = n + 2017 ]","completion":"1.

According to the problem, each segment of the line must intersect with some other segment, and those intersections must be mutually perpendicular. This inherently implies a symmetric structure. - Furthermore, if the closed polygonal line is symmetric, the number of segments (let's denote it as (N)) must be even. This is because symmetry around an axis would divide the line into two equal parts. 2. **Parity and Modulo Property**: - Upon closer inspection of the criteria and the nature of such a symmetrical shape, we need (N) to also not be divisible by 4. The reasoning behind this stems from the intersection requirement. If (N) were divisible by 4, arranging the segments such that every segment intersects another at right angles while maintaining symmetry would be inherently impossible due to geometric constraints. 3. **Verification Against 315 Segments**: - Given (N = 315), we check its properties: - 315 is odd. - 315 is not divisible by 4. - Since 315 is odd, it immediately violates the requirement for symmetry, which mandates (N) be even. 4. **Construct Examples**: - To further cement this understanding, one can attempt to construct such a polygonal line using smaller values for (N). For instance, attempting to construct lines with (N = 6) or (N = 14) can provide insight into how the intersections and symmetry play out. - For (N = 6): - If you attempt to draw a symmetrical closed six-segment line where each segment intersects another at a right angle, it becomes geometrically infeasible. - For (N = 14): - Similar geometric attempts will show that maintaining the intersection and perpendicularity constraints fails as the structure cannot sustain those many right-angled intersections without violating the closed nature or symmetry. 5. **Conclusion**: - Hence, a closed polygonal line of 315 segments that meets all given criteria cannot exist. By systematically analyzing the geometric and algebraic constraints, we can conclude that a closed polygonal line consisting of 315 segments, where each segment intersects another at right angles and forms a symmetric shape, cannot be constructed.

Part (a): 1. **Expression for the Number with 100 Twos:** - Consider the power tower (2^{2^{2 cdots{ }^{2}}}) with 100 twos. This can be denoted as (T_{100}). - Let's compare (T_{100}) with 3. 2. **Growth of Power Towers:** - The expression (2^{2^{2 cdots{ }^{2}}}) (with 100 twos) grows extremely rapidly. - Even with a few layers of the power tower, the value becomes unimaginably large. - For example: (T_1 = 2,) (T_2 = 2^2 = 4,) (T_3 = 2^{2^2} = 2^4 = 16.) - Successive values of (T_n) become exponentially larger due to the exponentiation. 3. **Conclusion for Part (a):** - Clearly, no matter how large the exponentiation structure with 100 layers of twos is, it will be much larger than 3. - Therefore, the number (2^{2^{2 cdots{ }^{2}}}) with 100 twos is significantly larger than 3.

The base increase from 3 to 4 significantly increases the value. - For example: (3^{3^{3}}...) compared to (4^{4^{4}}...) 3. **Conclusion for Part (b):** - (P_{100} > Q_{99}) because adding another layer of 3 results in an enormous increase. - (R_{99}) which uses base 4 instead of base 3 will generally outgrow the same height tower with base 3. - Therefore, (3^{3^{3 cdots{3}}}) with 100 layers of threes is larger as compared to 99-any other configuration listed (towers with 4).

Initially, each player ( P_i ) wins against all lower-rated players, so we initialize ( W_i = i + n ). 2. **Adjusting Win-Counts:** The condition that ( k ) games had the lower-rated player beat the higher-rated player means that we pick ( k ) distinct pairs ( (i, j) ) with ( i < j ), and set: [ W_i := W_i + 1 ] [ W_j := W_j - 1 ] This represents ( P_i ) beating ( P_j ). 3. **Defining ( d ):** Let ( d = leftlceil sqrt{2k} rightrceil - 1 ).

Mathematically, we express this condition as: [ O_1M^2 - r_1^2 = O_2M^2 - r_2^2 ] Plugging in the coordinates and using the distance formula: [ left( (x + x_1)^2 + y^2 right) - r_1^2 = left( (x - x_2)^2 + y^2 right) - r_2^2 ] 3. **Simplify the Equation**: Since (y^2) appears on both sides, subtract it: [ (x + x_1)^2 - r_1^2 = (x - x_2)^2 - r_2^2 ] 4. **Expand the Squares**: Expanding the squares on both sides gives: [ x^2 + 2xx_1 + x_1^2 - r_1^2 = x^2 - 2xx_2 + x_2^2 - r_2^2 ] 5. **Cancel the Common Terms**: The (x^2) terms on both sides cancel each other: [ 2xx_1 + x_1^2 - r_1^2 = -2xx_2 + x_2^2 - r_2^2 ] 6. **Solve for x**: Rearrange the terms to solve for x: [ 2xx_1 + 2xx_2 = x_2^2 - x_1^2 + r_1^2 - r_2^2 ] Factor out 2x from the left side: [ 2x(x_1 + x_2) = x_2^2 - x_1^2 + r_1^2 - r_2^2 ] Finally, solve for x: [ x = frac{1}{2(x_1 + x_2)} left( r_1^2 - r_2^2 + x_2^2 - x_1^2 right) ] 7. **Conclusion**: The above equation shows that x is a constant value, which means the solution is a line perpendicular to the x-axis. Hence, the radical axis of the two circles is a vertical line.

Between 1500 and 3000 feet, there is an upward current slowing the diver's descent by 20 feet per minute. Below 3000 feet, the diver resumes the normal descending speed. Additionally, the diver must make two decompression stops, one at 1800 feet for 5 minutes and another at 3600 feet for 8 minutes. The lost ship is located at a depth of 4000 feet below sea level. Considering these factors, how long will it take the diver to reach the lost ship?","completion":"To calculate the total time it will take the diver to reach the lost ship, we need to consider the different rates of descent and the decompression stops. 1. From the surface to 1500 feet: The diver descends at a rate of 80 feet per minute, but with the downward current, the speed increases by 30 feet per minute. So the diver descends at a rate of 80 + 30 = 110 feet per minute. To descend 1500 feet at this rate, it will take 1500 / 110 ≈ 13.64 minutes. 2. From 1500 to 3000 feet: The diver faces an upward current, which slows the descent by 20 feet per minute. So the diver descends at a rate of 80 - 20 = 60 feet per minute. To descend the next 1500 feet at this rate, it will take 1500 / 60 = 25 minutes. 3. From 3000 to 4000 feet: The diver resumes the normal descending speed of 80 feet per minute. To descend the final 1000 feet at this rate, it will take 1000 / 80 = 12.5 minutes. Now, we need to add the time for the decompression stops: - The first stop at 1800 feet for 5 minutes. - The second stop at 3600 feet for 8 minutes. The total time for the decompression stops is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes. Adding up all the times: 13.64 (from surface to 1500 feet) + 25 (from 1500 to 3000 feet) + 12.5 (from 3000 to 4000 feet) + 13 (decompression stops) = 13.64 + 25 + 12.5 + 13 = 64.14 minutes. Therefore, it will take the diver approximately boxed{64.14} minutes to reach the lost ship."},{"prompt":"a certain school, there are 2400 students in total across the first, second, and third years of senior high.

This is because for any right triangle, the midpoint of the hypotenuse is the circumcenter. - Reflecting (C) across (BD) means (D) is equidistant from (C) and (C_1). Thus, (C_1) lies on the circumscribed circle of triangle (ABC). 3. **Use Circle Properties**: - Since (D) is the center of the circumcircle and (C_1) is on this circle, both triangles (ABC) and (AB C_1) share the same circumcircle. This means (AC_1) forms the same angle with the hypotenuse via the circle property. 4. **Calculate (angle AC_1B)**: - By symmetry and reflection properties, the reflected triangle maintains the angles relative to the hypotenuse. - Specifically, (angle BDC_1 = angle BDC = 90^circ) since (D) is a right-angle midpoint. - Therefore, (angle AC_1B) formed by the line from (A) through (C) to (C_1) involves a right turn plus the angle (alpha) between (B) and the reflected line (C_1). 5. **Display and Summarize the Result**: - Breaking the steps apart, we recognize: [ angle AC_1B = angle ACA_1 text{ (the right angle at the reflection)} + alpha. ] - Thus, [ angle AC_1B = 90^circ + alpha. ] # Conclusion: The required angle (angle AC_1B) is [ boxed{90^circ + alpha} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a quadrilateral (ABCD) into which a circle can be inscribed, prove that the two circles inscribed in triangles (ABC) and (ADC) touch the diagonal (AC) at the same point.","completion":"Given a quadrilateral (ABCD) in which a circle can be inscribed, we need to prove that the two circles inscribed in triangles (ABC) and (ADC) are tangent to the diagonal (AC) at the same point. 1. **Definition of Tangency at a Single Point**: When a circle is inscribed in a triangle, it is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. For two inscribed circles in different triangles to be tangent to a common line at the same point, this implies a common tangency point on that line. 2. **Properties of Tangent Circles in Inscribed Quadrilaterals**: Let the quadrilateral (ABCD) be such that it admits an inscribed circle.

Specifically, set the common tangent distances in such a way that: [ AP_1 + PR = AR = AP_2 + PR text{ and } CR + RCQ_1 = ACQ = CR + CRQ_2. ] This ensures that the length from (A) to the tangency point on ( AC ) will be equal when considering triangles (ABC) and (ADC), establishing the shared tangency at ( R ). 6. **Conclusion**: From the properties of tangency and the given conditions, we have shown that the shared tangency point of the inscribed circles on the diagonal ( AC ) is indeed the same point ( R ). Therefore, the two circles inscribed in triangles (ABC) and (ADC) are tangent to the diagonal (AC) at the same point.

We need to determine (D Z). Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Identify the Parallelogram (C_1 X Z Y):** - Given the description, lines (C_{1} Y) and (Z X) lie in the parallel planes (B B_{1} C_{1} C) and (A A_{1} D_{1} D), meaning they do not intersect. - Since these lines are in the same plane (C_{1} X Y Z), they must be parallel. - Similarly, lines (Y Z) and (C_{1} X) are parallel. - Therefore, quadrilateral (C_{1} X Z Y) is a parallelogram by definition. 2. **Translate Problem to Simplified Figure:** - We can observe that (A D = B C) and (A D = B_1 C_1 = 14). - On (A D), we lay off a segment (A T) such that (A T = B Y = 3). - Hence, quadrilateral (B Y T A) becomes a parallelogram, implying segments (Y T) and (B A) are parallel and equal. 3. **Calculate Lengths within the Parallelogram:** - Since (D_1 C_1 Z X) forms another parallelogram: [ D_1 C_1 = X Z ] - Given (A_1 X = 5), (B_1 C_1 = 14), and (Y Z = C_1 X = 14). 4. **Establish Relationship and Find (D Z):** - We recognize the vectors and resultant segments involved: [ begin{aligned} D Z &= Z T + A D - A T &= X D_1 + B_1 C_1 - B Y &= (A_1 D_1 - A_1 X) + B_1 C_1 - B Y end{aligned} ] - Substitute the given lengths: [ begin{aligned} D Z &= (14 - 5) + 14 - 3 &= 9 + 14 - 3 &= 20 end{aligned} ] Conclusion: Thus, the length (D Z) is (20).

Hence, no column can be fully empty. Next, we argue that even two adjacent empty cells cannot exist. Suppose there were two such cells, say one above the other. We travel through empty cells until we hit a domino piece on one side (say, on top). If this domino cannot be moved downwards, it means the domino piece is horizontal, and there must be another domino piece covering the cell adjacent to the first domino. This scenario would imply that the domino can be moved sideways into the group of empty cells, contradicting the immobility condition. Consequently, this reasoning implies that an empty cell cannot end up on the boundary of the rectangle. If it would, one of the three (or two, in the case of a corner cell) neighboring domino pieces could be moved into the empty cell. Next, let's subdivide the entire rectangle into 2 times 2 squares, possibly leaving one or two rows or columns of width 1 along the edges. In these edge rows or columns, there are no empty cells, and in each 2 times 2 square, there can be at most one empty cell. Therefore, the number of empty cells is less than or equal to frac{mn}{4}. Thus, we can conclude that: [ text{the number of empty cells is less than } frac{mn}{4}. ] [ boxed{frac{mn}{4}} ] b): From part a), we have already established that each empty cell is surrounded by four adjacent domino pieces. However, two empty cells (let’s call them (a) and (b)) separated by one cell cannot both be surrounded by domino pieces simultaneously. This means such adjacent empty cells cannot exist. Now, adding to each empty cell its four neighboring cells forms a cross shape of five cells around each empty cell. These crosses cannot intersect or extend beyond the boundary of the board. But these crosses do not cover corner cells, so their number (i.e., the number of empty cells) must be less than ( frac{mn}{5} ).

Let's verify that the given recurrence relation holds following detailed steps: 1. **Understanding the Set of Paths E_n**: - Consider paths from (0, 0) to (n, n) that stay below the line y = x. Let E_{n} be the set of such paths. - We can partition these paths according to the abscissa of their first intersection with the diagonal (excluding the origin). 2. **Partitioning E_n by the First Intersection**: - Let A_k be the set of paths in E_n that intersect the diagonal for the first time at (k, k), where 1 le k le n. - Clearly, E_n can be written as a disjoint union of A_k for k = 1, 2, ldots, n. 3. **Decomposing Paths in A_k**: - A path in A_k consists of two subpaths: 1. **From (0, 0) to (k, k-1)**: This subpath must remain entirely below the line y = x. 2. **From (k, k) to (n, n)**: This subpath must also remain entirely below the line y = x. - The first subpath corresponds to a path in E_{k-1}. - The second subpath corresponds to a path in E_{n-k}. 4. **Counting the Subpaths**: - Using the properties of the paths in Catalan numbers, the number of paths in E_{k-1} is mathcal{C}_{k-1}. - Similarly, the number of paths in E_{n-k} is mathcal{C}_{n-k}. 5. **Bijective Correspondence**: - There is a bijective correspondence between the set A_k and the Cartesian product E_{k-1} times E_{n-k}. - This implies left| A_k right| = left| E_{k-1} right| times left| E_{n-k} right| = mathcal{C}_{k-1} mathcal{C}_{n-k}. 6. **Summing Over All Possible First Intersections**: - Summing the size of each A_k over all k from 1 to n: left| E_n right| = sum_{k=1}^{n} mathcal{C}_{k-1} mathcal{C}_{n-k} - Making a variable substitution m = k-1 for convenience: mathcal{C}_{n} = sum_{k=1}^{n} mathcal{C}_{k-1} mathcal{C}_{n-k} = sum_{m=0}^{n-1} mathcal{C}_{m} mathcal{C}_{n-1-m} Which matches the desired recurrence relation: mathcal{C}_{n} = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} mathcal{C}_{k} mathcal{C}_{n-k-1} # Conclusion: [ mathcal{C}_{n} = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} mathcal{C}_{k} mathcal{C}_{n-k-1} ] blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Mary is baking a cake.

Can the baron's words be true?","completion":"1. **Initial Structure of the Castle:** - The grandfather built a square castle and divided it into 9 square halls. This means we have a large square divided into a 3x3 grid of smaller squares. 2. **Father’s Modification:** - The father of Baron Münchhausen further divided each of the 8 remaining halls (excluding the central one) into 9 equal square halls. This converts the 3x3 grid into a more complex grid where each of the 8 outer halls is further divided. 3. **Considering the New Division:** - Each of the 8 halls is divided into a 3x3 grid. Thus, we went from having (8 + 1 = 9) halls to having (8 times 9 + 1 = 72 + 1 = 73) halls in the modified structure. This includes the central hall that remains unchanged. 4. **Final Structure by the Baron:** - The baron further divides the 64 free halls into 9 equal square rooms, thus each hall hereafter into a 3x3 grid. 5. **Counting Living Rooms:** - For each hall among the 64 free ones, it is further divided into 9 rooms. Thus, we now have (64 times 9 = 576) individual rooms. 6. **Central Placement in Rooms:** - In each of these new grids of 9 rooms (which make up 1 hall), the center is made into a swimming pool. This leaves (9 - 1 = 8) rooms as living spaces per hall. 7. **Total Number of Living Rooms:** - With 64 halls and each having 8 living rooms, we now calculate the total number of living rooms: [ 64 times 8 = 512 ] 8. **Baron’s Claim:** - The baron claims to have managed to walk through all the living rooms, visiting each one exactly once, and then return to the starting room. This is equivalent to finding a Hamiltonian cycle (a path that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex) in a specific grid graph. 9. **Mathematical Feasibility:** - A Hamiltonian cycle is a well-known concept in graph theory, and if we visualize the halls as graph vertices and the doors between rooms (each room has a door to each of its four edges allowing movement), it becomes a problem of traversability. - Hamiltonian cycles in rectangular grid graphs are possible with certain conditions and given the constraints fit within these types, it’s conceivable. The presence of doors between all adjacent living rooms makes this path theoretically possible. # Conclusion The detailed explanation and consideration for each of the structural modifications show that it is reasonable to believe that the baron's claim could be valid given the specific structure and connections he described.

Let O be the center of the sphere inscribed in the pyramid SABCD E. Define H as the point where the sphere is tangent to the base of the pyramid, and P as the point where the sphere is tangent to one of the lateral faces, say SAB. 2. Since O is the center of the sphere, the radius OH is perpendicular to the plane of the base of the pyramid. Hence, OH is perpendicular to AB, the common edge between the base and the lateral face SAB. [ OH perp AB quad text{and} quad OP perp text{plane } SAB rightarrow OP perp AB ] 3. Thus, the plane POH is perpendicular to AB. Let's denote the intersection of this plane with AB as point M. Therefore, we have: [ MP perp AB quad text{and} quad MH perp AB ] 4. Moreover, MP = MH since they are tangents to the sphere from the same point M. 5. If we rotate the face SAB around the edge AB to lie in the plane of the base, the segment MP will coincide with MH, and the point P will move to the point H. This proves that if all lateral faces of the pyramid are rotated similarly around their corresponding edges, the tangency points with the sphere will coincide at H. Second Assertion: 6. For the second claim, consider another tangency point Q where the sphere is tangent to a different lateral face, such as SBC. Similarly, QS and PS would be equal since they are tangents drawn from the same point S to the sphere: [ PS = QS ] 7. Given that all lateral faces have been rotated to coincide with the plane of the base, it follows that all vertices of the lateral faces must lie on a circumference centered at H.

However, the key idea is to check when other constraints are satisfied without increasing the number of objects. 6. **Consider constraints to support consistency:** - If Petya drew all possible yellow bananas (since all bananas are yellow and there must be a subset of them in the (15) yellow objects), and to satisfy the (13) edible objects, some of the balls can indeed be of any color including yellow. 7. **Example check with constraints all in place:** - (18) round objects all being balls, - (13) edible objects includes some other than balls, under the assumption the balls aren't categorized strictly as edible, e.g., assuming certain number split into (13 - excluding ) bananas or tomatoes. 8. **Conclusion:** - Since the constraints allow for all (18) counted round objects to be balls, with color variation not contradicting, hence, the maximum possible number of balls Petya could draw is therefore: [ boxed{18} ]"},{"prompt":"was given two twodigit natural numbers.

Let’s denote this common last digit as (a). 2. **Analysis of conditions:** - The product of the rounded numbers ends in 0 (being multiples of 10). The product of the original numbers ends in 6 because we need 16 ((4 times 4 = 16)) or 36 ((6 times 6 = 36)). - The second condition states that the product of rounded numbers is 184 larger, which means the rounded numbers must end in 6.

Given the rectangle dimensions are 2 units by 4 units, the circle's radius must be 1 unit. 2. **Equation of the Circle**: As the circle is centered at the origin and has a radius of 1, its equation is: [ x^2 + y^2 = 1 ] 3. **Equation of the Diagonal**: One diagonal of the rectangle extends from one corner to the opposite corner.

Select an arbitrary vertex A from the triangulated polygon. 2. Choose any vertex B. 3. Observe that there can be multiple paths from vertex A to vertex B. Each path can be characterized by a certain number of edges, or \\"steps\\". 4. According to the problem's conditions, the polygon is properly two-colored, which implies that the number of steps taken along any correctly colored path from A to B will have the same parity. Specifically, the remainder when divided by 3 will be the same for all paths from A to B. This is due to the fact that the colors alternate and cycle every three steps. 5. Now assign the number corresponding to this remainder modulo 3 to the vertex B. For instance, if B can be reached in k steps from A, the number assigned to B will be k mod 3. These numbers will be 0, 1, or 2. 6. Repeat the process for every other vertex in the triangulated polygon, assigning numbers based on the same rule. 7. To prove that any two neighboring vertices receive different numbers: - Let B_1 and B_2 be two adjacent vertices. - Let’s say there is an edge (color boundary) between B_1 and B_2. - Assume B_1 is reached from A in p steps, so B_1's assigned number is p mod 3. - Moving to B_2 from B_1 takes exactly one additional step, so the number of steps from A to B_2 is p+1. 8. Calculate the residue modulo 3 for B_2: - The residue for p+1 when divided by 3 will be different from the residue for p unless p+1 is equivalent to p modulo 3, which is impossible as they differ by 1. - Therefore, the residues (numbers) for p and p+1 give different values in set {0, 1, 2}. 9.

Let (2^k) be the highest power of two that divides any of the chosen numbers. 3. **Neighboring Numbers Differ by (2^k):** If at least two of the chosen numbers are divisible by (2^k), then two such neighboring numbers differ by (2^k). This means one of these numbers must also be divisible by (2^{k+1}). However, since (2^k) is the highest power of two considered in our list, this scenario is impossible. Hence, exactly one number in the list is divisible by (2^k). 4. **Least Common Multiple (LCM) Relationship:** - The least common multiple (LCM) of a group containing this number must be divisible by (2^k). - The LCM of the remaining group will not be divisible by (2^k). 5. **Sum Analysis:** Therefore, the sum of these two LCM values will not be divisible by (2^k).

This is a nontrivial observation that we will use. 3. **Counting Good Circles**: - The total number of such circles can be considered modulo 2. The number of ways to choose 3 points out of ( 2n+1 ) is given by: [ binom{2n+1}{3} ] - Since each good circle is counted three times (once for each of its three points), the number of good circles is: [ frac{1}{3} binom{2n+1}{3} pmod{2} ] - Simplifying the binomial coefficient: [ binom{2n+1}{3} = frac{(2n+1)(2n)(2n-1)}{6} ] - Modulo 2, the expression simplifies to: [ frac{(2n+1)(2n)(2n-1)}{6} equiv n pmod{2} ] 4. **Proof of the Key Observation**: - Consider two points ( P ) and ( Q ) in ( S ). Divide the remaining ( 2n-1 ) points into two groups based on which side of the line ( PQ ) they lie. - Label the points on one side as ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_m ) and the points on the other side as ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_p ) where ( m + p = 2n-1 ). - Let the angles ( angle PA_1Q, ldots, angle PA_mQ ) be ( alpha_1, ldots, alpha_m ) respectively, and the angles ( angle PB_1Q, ldots, angle PB_pQ ) be ( pi - beta_1, ldots, pi - beta_p ) respectively. - Assume ( alpha_1 > alpha_2 > cdots > alpha_m ) and ( beta_1 > beta_2 > cdots > beta_p ). 5. **Transformation and Parity Preservation**: - Consider a transformation where we replace ( A_i ) with ( A'_i ) such that ( alpha'_i = beta_j ) and replace ( B_j ) with ( B'_j ) such that ( pi - beta'_j = pi - alpha_i ). - This transformation changes the order of angles but preserves the parity of the number of good circles. 6. **Final Configuration**: - After repeated transformations, we achieve a configuration where ( beta'_1 > beta'_2 > cdots > beta'_p > alpha'_1 > cdots > alpha'_m ). - In this configuration, if ( m ge n ), there is exactly one good circle ( PQA_i ) when ( i = n ). - If ( p ge n ), there is exactly one good circle ( PQB_j ) when ( j = p + 1 - n ). - Since ( m + p = 2n - 1 ), exactly one of ( m ge n ) or ( p ge n ) holds, ensuring exactly one good circle in this configuration. 7. **Conclusion**: - The number of good circles has the same parity as ( n ).

This is because any integer can be factored into primes, and the only primes that divide 10 are 2 and 5. 2. **Using Euler's Theorem:** By Euler's Theorem, for any integer ( c ) such that ( gcd(c, 10) = 1 ), we have: [ c mid 10^{varphi(c)} - 1 ] where ( varphi ) is the Euler's totient function. 3. **Divisibility by powers of 10:** Also, since ( 2^a ) and ( 5^b ) are powers of 2 and 5 respectively, we have: [ 2^a 5^b mid 10^{max{a, b}} ] This is because ( 10^{max{a, b}} ) is a power of 10 that is at least as large as the highest power of 2 or 5 in ( k ). 4. **Constructing ( n ):** Let: [ n = (10^{varphi(c)} - 1) cdot 10^{max{a, b}} ] We need to show that ( k mid n ).

When squared, the sum of the digits of ( n ) and ( n^2 ) should remain the same because squaring a number consisting of nines and zeros (with appropriate shifts) does not change the sum of the digits. 6. **Verification:** For any nonnegative integer ( m ), we have: [ Q(10^{2m} - 2 cdot 10^m + 1) = Q(10^m - 2) + 1 = Q(10^m - 1) ] This shows that the sum of the digits of ( n ) and ( n^2 ) are equal.

Therefore, the conclusion regarding the mode is correct. **Option B:** For the 8 students in Group A, the calculation of the average score bar{x}_{A} and variance s_{A}^{2} is as follows: - **Average Score bar{x}_{A} Calculation:** [ bar{x}_{A} = frac{3}{8} times 60 + frac{2}{8} times 65 + frac{3}{8} times 70 = frac{180 + 130 + 210}{8} = frac{520}{8} = 65 ] - **Variance s_{A}^{2} Calculation:** [ s_{A}^{2} = frac{3}{8} times (60 - 65)^2 + frac{2}{8} times (65 - 65)^2 + frac{3}{8} times (70 - 65)^2 ] [ = frac{3}{8} times 25 + frac{2}{8} times 0 + frac{3}{8} times 25 = frac{75 + 0 + 75}{8} = frac{150}{8} = frac{75}{4} ] So, the variance calculation aligns with the provided answer. **Option C:** For all 20 students, the average score overline{x} is calculated as follows: [ overline{x} = frac{3}{20} times 60 + frac{2}{20} times 65 + frac{3}{20} times 70 + frac{5}{20} times 75 + frac{4}{20} times 80 + frac{2}{20} times 85 + frac{1}{20} times 90 ] [ = frac{180 + 130 + 210 + 375 + 320 + 170 + 90}{20} = frac{1475}{20} = frac{295}{4} ] Therefore, the conclusion about the average being 75 is incorrect, as the actual average is frac{295}{4}. **Option D:** Since 20 times 25% = 5, the 25% percentile falls between the 5th and 6th scores when arranged in ascending order. Given the scores distribution, this percentile is calculated as the average of the 5th and 6th scores, which are 65 and 70, respectively. Hence, the 25% percentile is: [ frac{65 + 70}{2} = 67.5 ] Therefore, the conclusion regarding the 25% percentile being 65 is incorrect.

Therefore, the area S = frac{1}{2} cdot 2c cdot b = cb. 2. Using Heron's formula: The sides of the triangle are 2c, a, and a. The semi-perimeter of the triangle is frac{1}{2}(2c + a + a) = c + a.

The radius of this circle is frac{b}{3}, and it touches all three sides of the triangle. Therefore, the distance from the center of the circle to each side is equal to the radius. In particular, the distance from the center to the base (2c) is frac{b}{3}. Using the formula for the distance from a point to a line, we find that: frac{b}{3} = frac{b cdot 2c}{2 sqrt{c^2 + b^2}} Simplifying, we get: c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} Substituting this expression for c into the previous equation, we get: a^2e^2b^2 = a^3e(e + 1) Dividing both sides by a^2e, we obtain: b^2e = a(e + 1) Now, recall that the eccentricity e is given by: e = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}} Squaring both sides and substituting b^2 = a^2(1 - e^2), we get: a^2e^2 = a^2(1 - e^2) Rearranging terms, we find: e^2 + e - 1 = 0 Solving this quadratic equation for e, we obtain two possible values: e = -1 and e = frac{1}{2}.

Begin with the expression for (z): [ z = n^4 + 4k^4 ] 2.

The given condition can be restated as: for the maximum of f(x) to be less than the maximum of g(x), which is 2, we require f(x)_{text{max}} < g(x)_{text{max}} = 2. - When a geq 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing over (0, +infty) and its range is mathbb{R}, which is not consistent with the condition. For instance, we find that f(e^3) = ae^3 + 3 > 2, so this case is not possible. - When a < 0, f(x) is increasing on (0, -frac{1}{a}) and decreasing on (-frac{1}{a}, +infty). Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) is at the critical point x = -frac{1}{a}, so we calculate f(-frac{1}{a}) = -1 + ln(-frac{1}{a}) = -1 - ln(-a). To meet the condition, we have 2 > -1 - ln(-a), which yields a < -frac{1}{e}. Therefore, we can write the range of a as: [ boxed{a < -frac{1}{e}} ]"},{"prompt":"Circles S and T intersect at P and Q , with S passing through the centre of T .

The line ( PA ) meets circle ( T ) again at ( D ). We need to prove that ( |AD| = |PB| ). To prove this, we will use the properties of the angles and congruent triangles: 6. Consider the angles ( angle ADO ) and ( angle APO ). Since ( D ) lies on circle ( T ), ( angle ADO ) is an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc as ( angle APO ). Therefore, ( angle ADO = angle APO ). 7. Similarly, ( angle AQO ) is an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc as ( angle APO ). Therefore, ( angle AQO = angle APO ). 8. Since ( angle ADO = angle AQO ), we have ( angle DAO = 180^circ - angle PAO = angle PQO = angle QPO = angle QAO ). 9. Therefore, ( angle AOD = angle AOQ ). 10.

The formula for the estimator is: N = (C1 * C2) / R where: N = total population size C1 = number of individuals caught and tagged in the first catch C2 = total number of individuals caught in the second catch R = number of recaptured tagged individuals in the second catch However, in this scenario, we have multiple captures and taggings, so we need to adjust our calculations accordingly. First Capture: C1 = 50 (number of fish initially caught and tagged) Second Capture: C2 = 100 (30 tagged fish recaptured + 70 new fish caught and tagged) R = 30 (number of tagged fish recaptured) Using the formula, we can estimate the population after the second capture: N1 = (C1 * C2) / R N1 = (50 * 100) / 30 N1 = 5000 / 30 N1 = 166.67 This is the estimated population size after the second capture. However, we need to consider the third capture.

Here is the full detail of how we arrive at the answer. 1. **Understanding the Problem**: - There are 500 cyclists in a race. - The race consists of 15 stages. - Cyclists' positions are determined by their total time across all stages. - No cyclists have identical times, either on individual stages or in total. - Vasya finishes 7th in every stage. 2. **Key Observation**: - If a cyclist ( A ) has a better (lower-numbered) rank than cyclist ( B ), it means ( A ) must have finished ahead of ( B ) in at least one stage. 3. **Implication for Vasya**: - Vasya, finishing 7th in all 15 stages, is therefore overtaken by 6 cyclists in each stage. - Hence, across all 15 stages, a total of ( 6 times 15 = 90 ) different cyclists must have finished ahead of Vasya. 4. **Maximum Possible Rank for Vasya**: - Since Vasya is overtaken by 90 different cyclists, the highest rank Vasya can attain is when these 90 cyclists all finish ahead of him. This implies that there could be at most 90 cyclists with a better (lower-numbered) total time than Vasya. - Therefore, Vasya can potentially finish right after these 90 cyclists, giving him the rank: [ 1 + 90 = 91 ] Hence, Vasya’s worst possible rank (highest number) is 91, meaning there cannot be more than 90 cyclists above him; otherwise, there would be not enough distinct cyclists overtaking Vasya consistently. 5. **Example of Achieving Position 91**: - To verify that 91st place is possible for Vasya, consider the following: - If in each stage, the 6 cyclists finishing ahead of Vasya are different, we then have 90 distinct cyclists who consistently finish ahead of him. - Assume these 90 cyclists have all different total times just ahead of Vasya. - The remaining 409 cyclists finish behind Vasya in every stage and thus have worse total times than him. - If Vasya's total time is consistently ( T_7 ) per stage, and assume ( T_7 ) is in the middle range as described. Thus, there's a concrete scenario where Vasya can end up at exactly the 91st rank, and no ties or inconsistencies occur amongst the other positions. # Conclusion: By the logical deduction and the specific construction of finish times, the lowest possible rank (highest number rank) Vasya can achieve, given his consistent 7th place in each stage among the 500 cyclists, is indeed: [ boxed{91} ]"},{"prompt":"The Shouters are coached by Coach Loudso.

It is given that every triangle formed by any three of these 9 points has at least one red edge.

By assumption, every triangle formed by any three points contains at least one red edge. We need to show that there exist four points such that every pair of points among these four is connected by a red line. 2. **Pigeonhole Principle Application**: Since each point connects to 8 other points, each with either a red or blue line, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one point (A) must be connected to at least 4 points with lines of the same color. Assume without loss of generality this color is blue. [ A text{ is connected to } x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 text{ with blue lines}. ] 3. **Red Line Requirement in Triangles**: Since there cannot be a triangle with all blue edges, the lines connecting ({x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4}) must be red to avoid forming an all-blue triangle. Therefore, the set ({x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4}) has all red edges among them, satisfying our requirement. 4. **Considering Five Red Lines**: Suppose no point is connected via exactly 5 red lines, otherwise our argument above can be applied similarly for the red lines. 5. **Avoiding Non-Integral Solutions**: If each point connected with exactly 5 red lines, the total number of red lines would be: [ frac{9 times 5}{2} = 22.5 text{ lines, which is not an integer}. ] Thus, not all points can be connected by exactly 5 red lines, ensuring the existence of at least one point connected by at least 6 red lines. 6. **Addressing Six Red Connections**: Let (B) be a point connected to six other points with red lines: [ B text{ is connected to } y_1, y_2, ldots, y_6 text{ with red lines}. ] 7. **Further Examination of Colorings**: Observing the 5 lines connected to (y_1), at least 3 of these must be of the same color by another application of the pigeonhole principle. Suppose these are (y_1y_2, y_1y_3, y_1y_4). - If all these lines are blue, then ( {B, y_2, y_3, y_4 }) has all red connections. - If these lines are red, consider any subset forming a triangle like (triangle y_2y_3y_4), which can't be an all-red triangle, implying at least one red edge. 8. **Constructing a Red Complete Subgraph**: Either way, this shows that (B, y_1, y_2, y_3) form a group where every pair of points shares a red line ensuring that the solution is covered. # Conclusion Hence, we have shown the existence of such four points connected entirely by red lines as required.

Since D_2E parallel LE, we have triangle D_2LE sim triangle D_2ED. - Therefore, frac{LE}{ED} = frac{D_2E}{D_2D}. 6. **Harmonic Division**: - Since EDD_1D_2 is a harmonic division, we have frac{D_1E}{D_1D} = frac{D_2E}{D_2D}. - Therefore, frac{KE}{ED} = frac{LE}{ED}, which implies KE = LE. 7. **Perpendicularity**: - Since K and L are such that EK = EL, the line KL is the perpendicular bisector of E. - Therefore, KL is perpendicular to the bisector of angle ABC. 8. **Parallelism**: - We have frac{KI_2}{I_2D} = frac{KE}{ED} = frac{LE}{ED} = frac{LI_1}{I_1D}. - Hence, I_1I_2 parallel KL. 9. **Conclusion**: - Since KL is perpendicular to the bisector of angle ABC, it follows that I_1I_2 is also perpendicular to the bisector of angle ABC. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A 500 meter long train crosses a man standing on the platform in 3 seconds.

These are arranged counterclockwise typically. - The complex numbers assigned to the edges are then: [ frac{z_2}{z_1}, frac{z_3}{z_2}, ldots, frac{z_m}{z_{m-1}}, frac{z_1}{z_m} ] - The product over a cycle: [ frac{z_2}{z_1} cdot frac{z_3}{z_2} cdot cdots cdot frac{z_m}{z_{m-1}} cdot frac{z_1}{z_m} = 1 ] 7. **Conclusion:** - Hence, the product of all complex numbers around any polygonal shape in the MO soccer ball equals 1.

Introduction and Setup:** - We need to prove that any connected graph with at most two vertices of odd degree has an Eulerian path, also called an Eulerian walk. **2. Understanding the Problem:** - An Eulerian path is a trail in a graph that visits every edge exactly once. - According to Euler's Theorem for undirected graphs, a connected graph will contain an Eulerian path if it has exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. **3. Reference to Problem 22.4:** - From Problem 22.4, the graph can be imagined as a combination of non-intersecting cycles and possibly one non-intersecting path. **4. Consideration of the Graph Components:** - If a graph comprises only a non-intersecting path or exclusively cycles, the conclusion is straightforward: - A cycle itself is an Eulerian path. - A single path is already the path we are seeking. **5. Complex Graphs with Additional Cycles:** - Assume the graph contains some additional cycles beyond a selected path or cycle. - Due to the connectedness of the graph, any additional cycle shares at least one vertex with the existing non-intersecting path (or selected cycle). **6. Removing an Additional Cycle:** - Suppose there is a non-intersecting path and some additional cycles: - Consider a vertex that belongs to this non-intersecting path and one additional cycle. - If we exclude this additional cycle, the remaining portion of the graph still satisfies the conditions of connectedness and having zero or two vertices of odd degree. **7. Applying Induction:** - By induction hypothesis, if the derived (smaller) graph has an Eulerian path, so does the original graph. - To construct the Eulerian path for the original graph, traverse the obtained smaller graph up to the shared vertex, follow the additional cycle, and then continue with the initial path. **8. Constructing the Complete Eulerian Path:** - Start from a vertex in the derived graph with the Eulerian path. - Traverse the graph until you reach the common vertex belonging to both the derived path and the additional cycle. - Complete the traversal of the additional cycle. - Return to continue along the remaining derivation of the initial path. In conclusion, the original graph, given the constraints, indeed has an Eulerian path. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Find the point in the plane ( 4x 3y + 6z = 24 ) that is closest to the point ( (2,1,4) ).","completion":"Let ( A = (2,1,4) ), and let ( P ) be the point in the plane which is closest to ( A ).

Let's denote the total number of soldiers by n. 2. According to the problem, every new recruit looks either at the back of their neighbor's head or directly at their face, except for the two soldiers on the edges, who can also look at the poles. 3. After the first command, if a soldier looks at their neighbor's back, then after turning, that neighbor will look back at them. Therefore, the number of soldiers looking at the back doesn't change. 4. However, after a turn, the edge soldiers' behavior might change: - If an edge soldier was looking at a pole, they will not be doing so after turning. - Conversely, if they weren't looking at a pole, they will look at the pole after turning. 5. Hence, the number of soldiers looking at the poles may stay the same (if it was 1 and remains 1 after) or may increase/decrease by 2 (from 0 to 2 or 2 to 0). 6. As the total number of soldiers is constant, the number of soldiers looking directly at each other will change similarly – it may stay the same, increase by 2, or decrease by 2. 7. Initially, the number of soldiers looking each other in the eye was one-sixth (frac{1}{6}) of the number looking at the back of heads. Afterwards, it becomes one-seventh (frac{1}{7}). 8. Thus, the number of soldiers looking directly at each other must decrease (since it changes from frac{1}{6} to frac{1}{7} of the number of soldiers looking at the back). Specifically, it clearly decreases by 2 since 2 (frac{1}{6} and frac{1}{7} close values both rounded of six) was the difference. 9. The decrease equates to the difference between the fractions frac{1}{6} and frac{1}{7} of the constant number of soldiers looking at the backs. 10. Finding this difference we get: [ frac{1}{6} - frac{1}{7} = frac{7 - 6}{42} = frac{1}{42} ] 11.

Each vertex ( u_i in V ) corresponds to a mathematician, and an edge ( (u_i, u_j) in E ) exists if and only if ( u_i ) and ( u_j ) are friends. Let ( n = |V| ) be the number of mathematicians and ( e = |E| ) be the number of edges. 2. **Define the degree of a vertex:** The degree ( deg(u_i) ) of a vertex ( u_i ) is the number of friends that mathematician ( u_i ) has. Since every mathematician has at least one friend, ( deg(u_i) geq 1 ) for all ( u_i in V ). 3. **Assume the contrary:** Suppose the statement is not true. This means that for every mathematician ( u_i in V ), the average number of friends of their friends is less than the average number of friends in the whole group.

Once we have the sets (A) and (B), we arrange the squares in these sets along two parallel diagonals, thus ensuring that no two squares from sets (A) or (B) touch each other except possibly at their vertices. 5. Now we incorporate the four largest squares along two perpendicular diagonals to complete the arrangement: - One diagonal has squares with side lengths (n) and (n-3), - The other diagonal has squares with side lengths (n-1) and (n-2). 6. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1:** The sum of the side lengths of squares in (A) is 1 unit larger than the sum of the side lengths of the squares in (B). - Attach the squares with side lengths (n-3) and (n-1) to the (A)-diagonal, and attach the squares with side lengths (n) and (n-2) to the (B)-diagonal. - **Verification:** [ left(sum_{i} a_i right) sqrt{2} + frac{(n-3 + n-1)sqrt{2}}{2} = left(sum_{j} b_j + 2 right) sqrt{2} + frac{(n + n-2)sqrt{2}}{2} ] This verifies that the arrangement works for this case. - **Case 2:** The sum of the side lengths of squares in (A) is 2 units larger than the sum of the side lengths of the squares in (B). - Attach the squares with side lengths (n-3) and (n-2) to the (A)-diagonal, and attach the squares with side lengths (n) and (n-1) to the (B)-diagonal. - **Verification:** [ left(sum_{i} a_i right) sqrt{2} + frac{(n-3 + n-2)sqrt{2}}{2} = left(sum_{j} b_j + 1 right) sqrt{2} + frac{(n + n-1)sqrt{2}}{2} ] This verifies that the arrangement works for this case as well. 7. **Distance Analysis:** - The distance between the diagonals where sets (A) and (B) are arranged: [ frac{((n-3) + n) sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{(2n - 3)sqrt{2}}{2} ] - Since for any (i, j), (a_i, b_j leq n-4), [ frac{(a_i + b_j)sqrt{2}}{2} < frac{(2n - 4)sqrt{2}}{2} < frac{(2n - 3)sqrt{2}}{2} ] This ensures that the (A)- and (B)-diagonals do not overlap. 8. **Splitting the Squares into Sets (A) and (B):** - We present a way to split the squares of side lengths (1) through (n-4) into two sets (A) and (B) as required: - **Direct Construction:** 1.

Handle the remaining numbers as follows: - If one number remains, put it in (A), - If two numbers remain, put the larger number in (A) and the smaller in (B), - If three numbers remain, place two in (A) and one in (B) to maintain the required difference, - If four numbers remain, split them such that the difference in the sums remains 1 or 2. - **Indirect Construction:** 1. Start with two empty sets (A) and (B), 2. Add squares from length (n-4) to (2) to either set minimizing the difference in sums at each step by induction, 3. Finally, add the square of side length 1 to either (A) or (B) to achieve the final required difference of 1 or 2. # Conclusion: Since we have verified that it is always possible to split and arrange (1, 2, ldots, n) squares such that every square touches exactly two other squares without overlap, we conclude that (boxed{text{It is possible.}})"},{"prompt":"Let S_{n} be the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}.

If we delete a non-trailing zero, the resulting number has an odd number of trailing zeroes and is not a square. If we delete a trailing zero, the resulting number has an even number of trailing zeroes and is not a square. Thus, only deleting non-trailing zeroes can yield a square. - Assume ( N ) does not have trailing zeroes. 2. **Considering Large ( N ):** - Suppose ( N ) has ( d > 1000 ) digits. Let ( a_i ) be the number formed by deleting the ( i )-th digit from the left. - If ( a_i ) is a square, the next square must differ by at least ( 10^{d-5} ).

Thus, ( y in {0, -x} pmod{2^{k-2}} ), giving two values for ( y pmod{2^{k-10}} ). - If ( 5^k mid y(x + y) ), then either ( y equiv 0 pmod{5^{k/2-10}} ) or ( x + y equiv 0 pmod{5^{k/2-10}} ), yielding at most two values for ( y pmod{5^{k/2-10}} ). - Combining these, we get at most four values for ( y pmod{2^{k-10}5^{k/2-10}} ). The claim holds similarly if ( 5 nmid x ). 4. **Bounding the Number of Squares:** - Consider ( i ) such that ( a_i ) is a square.

Determine the set of all nice integers.","completion":"To determine the set of all \\"nice\\" integers, we analyze the given problem and the provided solution. Below is a step-by-step detailed explanation and extension of the solution. 1. **Definition and Interpretation**: The problem defines a \\"nice\\" integer ( n ) which is odd and ( n geq 3 ). An integer ( n ) is \\"nice\\" if there exists a permutation ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) of the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) such that the sums [ y_k = a_k - a_{k+1} + a_{k+2} - cdots + a_{k+n-1} ] for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n ) are all positive. Note that the indices in the sums are taken modulo ( n ). 2. **Rewriting the Sums**: We express the sums ( y_k ) in a general form: [ y_k = a_k - a_{k+1} + a_{k+2} - a_{k+3} + cdots + a_{k+n-1} ] where indices wrap around, i.e., ( a_{k+n} = a_k ). 3. **Important Observation**: Let’s consider the sums pairwise: [ y_1 + y_{2} = (a_1 - a_{2} + a_3 - a_4 + cdots + a_{n-1} + a_n) + (a_2 - a_{3} + a_4 - a_5 + cdots + a_{n} + a_1) ] Simplifying, we get: [ y_1 + y_{2} = a_1 + a_1 = 2a_1 ] Similarly, for ( y_2 + y_3 ): [ y_2 + y_3 = 2a_2 ] This pattern holds for all other pairwise sums: [ y_k + y_{k+1} = 2a_k ] 4. **Case Analysis**: We consider two cases for ( n ): ( n = 4k-1 ) and ( n = 4k+1 ). - **Case 1**: ( n = 4k-1 ) Since ( y_k ) values must be even (because they are sums of even numbers of terms involving both additions and subtractions of all odd numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, n )), the sums being positive and even implies each ( y_k geq 2 ). However, if sum ( y_t + y_{t+1} = 2a_t ) and ( a_t = 1 ), then ( 2a_t = 2 ) suggests that ( y_t + y_{1} = 2 ) can be potentially problematic under divisors of permutation sums, failing the positivity/harmony. Thus, ( 4k-1 ) integers cannot be \\"nice\\". - **Case 2**: ( n = 4k+1 ) Let's consider an example permutation for ( n = 4k+1 ): [ 2, 4, 6, ldots, 4k, 4k+1, 4k-1, ldots, 3, 1 ] In this arrangement: [ y_1 = y_{4k+1} = 1, quad y_2 = y_{4k} = 3, quad ldots, quad y_{2k} = y_{2k+2} = 4k-1, quad y_{2k+1} = 4k+1 ] Each ( y_k ) is positive, thus ( n = 4k+1 ) integers are possible to form \\"nice\\" integers. 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we conclude that the set of all \\"nice\\" integers includes all integers of the form ( n = 4k+1 ) where ( k ) is a natural number.

Let A be the intersection of the internal tangents to odot G_1 and odot G_2 with the chord of G. Let B and C be the endpoints of the external tangents from G_1 and G_2 to point W. To show that W is the incenter of triangle ABC, follow the steps: 1. **Determine the Intersection Points and Lengths**: - Let D be the intersection point of AW and BC. - Let E and F be the intersection points of odot G_1 and odot G_2 with BC respectively. - Denote the lengths as follows: - BE = x - CF = y - BD = k - CD = h - AD = d 2. **Express DE and DF**: DE = k - x DF = h - y 3. **Use the Property of Equal Line Segments**: Since DE = DW = DF, we have: k - x = h - y Thus, k - x = h - y AW = d - k + x = d - h + y 4. **Use the Radical Axis Theorem**: For point A and circle odot G_1, we can express the relation of the intersecting points: (A, odot G_1) = d - k + x Similarly, we can write for other segments: (A, B) = c (A, C) = b (odot G_1, B) = x (odot G_1, C) = a - x (B, C) = a 5. **Apply the Generalized Ptolemy's Theorem**: Applying the theorem to [A, odot G_1, B, C], we get: (d - k + x) cdot a + b cdot x = c cdot (a - x) 6. **Solving for x**: Setting p = frac{1}{2}(a + b + c), we deduce: x = frac{a}{2p}(k + c - d) 7. **Using BC, odot G_2 and A**: By symmetry, we get: y = frac{a}{2P}(h + b - d) 8. **Setting k - x = h - y**: k - frac{a}{2p}(k + c - d) = h - frac{a}{2p}(h + b - d) Simplifying: (b + c) cdot k - a cdot c = (b + c) cdot h - a cdot b (b + c)(k - h) = a cdot (c - b) 9. **Express BD + DC = BC**: k + h = a Consequently: (b + c)(k - h) = (k + h)(c - b) Thus, c cdot h = b cdot k Therefore: frac{k}{h} = frac{c}{b} 10. **Angle Bisector Proportion**: This implies: frac{BD}{CD} = frac{AB}{AC} Hence, AD bisects angle BAC. 11. **Values of k and h**: k = frac{ac}{b + c} h = frac{ab}{b + c} 12. **Solving for x**: k - x = frac{ac}{b + c} - frac{a}{2p}left(frac{ac}{b + c} + c - d right) = frac{ad}{2p} 13. **Calculating Ratios**: Therefore: frac{d}{k - x} = frac{d}{frac{ad}{2p}} = frac{2p}{a} = frac{a + b + c}{a} Then: frac{AW}{DW} = frac{AD}{DW} - 1 = frac{d}{k - x} - 1 = frac{a + b + c}{a} - 1 = frac{b + c}{a} = frac{c}{frac{ac}{b + c}} = frac{BA}{BD} Consequently: - Since BW bisects angle ABC, point W is indeed the incenter of triangle ABC.

We need to determine whether the line (a) is perpendicular to the plane (alpha). 2. **Visualize the Geometry:** - Consider a cylindrical surface with the axis along the line (a). - The plane (alpha) intersects this cylinder. Depending on the orientation of (alpha), the intersection can be different shapes (e.g., an ellipse if not perpendicular). 3. **Cross-Section Analysis:** - Let’s focus on the cross-section of the cylinder by the plane (alpha). - If plane (alpha) is not perpendicular to the axis (line (a)), then the intersection creates a set of lines within (alpha) that are tangents to the cylindrical cross-section. 4. **Tangents to the Cylinder:** - The tangents to the cylinder represent the lines within (alpha) that are equidistant from the axis (a). - The distance between the axis (line (a)) and any tangent line to the cylinder is the radius of the cylinder. 5. **Number of Tangents:** - For a plane intersecting a cylinder, the number of tangents depends on the properties of the intersection curve. - If we have exactly 2011 lines within (alpha) that are equidistant from line (a) (i.e., tangents to the cylinder), 6. **Checking Perpendicularity:** - If the plane (alpha) were perpendicular to the line (a), the intersection would be a circle, and an infinite number of tangents could be drawn from any external point around the circle. - The fixed number 2011 strongly suggests that the plane (alpha) is not oriented to provide simple circular cross-section, thus it is not perpendicular. 7. **Conclusion:** Given the analysis and geometric properties of the cylinder intersected by plane (alpha): [ boxed{text{No, the line } a text{ is not perpendicular to the plane } alpha.} ]"},{"prompt":"Given propositions p and q: Proposition p: The graph represented by the equation frac{{x}^{2}}{2m} + frac{{y}^{2}}{m1} = 1 is a hyperbola with foci on the yaxis.

Additionally, arrangements that can be obtained by rotation are considered identical. 2. **Applying Burnside's Lemma:** To count the number of distinct arrangements, we use Burnside's Lemma, which helps in counting the number of orbits of a group action. Here, the group action is the cyclic group (C_9) generated by (frac{2pi}{9}) counter-clockwise rotation. According to Burnside's Lemma, the number of distinct arrangements is given by: [ frac{1}{|G|} sum_{g in G} text{Fix}(g) ] where (|G| = 9) is the order of the group, and (text{Fix}(g)) is the number of arrangements fixed by the group element (g). 3. **Calculating Fixed Points:** - For the identity rotation (0 degrees), all (frac{9!}{3!^3}) arrangements are fixed. - For rotations by (frac{2pi}{9}) and (frac{4pi}{9}), no arrangement is fixed because no student can sit next to another student from the same country. - For rotations by (frac{6pi}{9}) and (frac{8pi}{9}), no arrangement is fixed for the same reason. - For rotations by (frac{2pi}{3}) and (frac{4pi}{3}), there are 6 fixed arrangements each. - For rotations by (pi), there are 6 fixed arrangements. Therefore, the total number of fixed points is: [ text{Fix}(text{identity}) + text{Fix}(frac{2pi}{3}) + text{Fix}(frac{4pi}{3}) + text{Fix}(pi) = frac{9!}{3!^3} + 6 + 6 + 6 ] 4. **Applying Burnside's Lemma:** [ frac{1}{9} left( frac{9!}{3!^3} + 6 + 6 + 6 right) = frac{1}{9} left( frac{362880}{6 times 6 times 6} + 18 right) = frac{1}{9} left( 280 + 18 right) = frac{298}{9} = 188 ] 5. **Classifying Patterns:** - Type R (Regular): Patterns with symmetry under (frac{2pi}{3}) rotation. There are 2 such patterns. - Type I (Irregular): Patterns without such symmetry. There are (188 - 2 = 186) such patterns. 6. **Counting Student Arrangements:** - For type I patterns, each pattern can be assigned (3!^3) ways. - For type R patterns, each pattern can be assigned (frac{3!^3}{3}) ways due to the symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct student arrangements is: [ 186 times 3!^3 + 2 times frac{3!^3}{3} = 186 times 216 + 2 times 72 = 40176 + 144 = 40320 ] The final answer is (boxed{40320})."},{"prompt":"My friend Sarah only likes numbers that are divisible by 8, such as 16, or 3,024.

According to the problem, F = 25 and B = 10% of D. B = 0.10 * D B = 0.10 * 70 B = 7 The number of diplomats who speak neither French nor Russian is 20% of D. Neither = 0.20 * D Neither = 0.20 * 70 Neither = 14 Now, let's use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of diplomats who do not speak Russian (let's denote this number as NR). NR = D - R We know that the total number of diplomats who speak at least one of the languages (French or Russian) is the sum of those who speak French, those who speak Russian, and subtracting those who speak both (since they are counted twice). Diplomats who speak at least one language = F + R - B We also know that the number of diplomats who speak neither language is Neither. So, the total number of diplomats is the sum of those who speak at least one language and those who speak neither. D = (F + R - B) + Neither Substitute the known values: 70 = (25 + R - 7) + 14 70 = 32 + R - 7 + 14 70 = R + 39 Now, solve for R: R = 70 - 39 R = 31 So, 31 diplomats speak Russian. Now, to find the number of diplomats who do not speak Russian (NR), we subtract the number of diplomats who speak Russian (R) from the total number of diplomats (D): NR = D - R NR = 70 - 31 NR = 39 Therefore, boxed{39} diplomats do not speak Russian."},{"prompt":"The instructor assigned grades on a scale from 0 to 100. The academic department can change the upper limit of the scale to any other natural number, recalculating the grades proportionally and rounding to the nearest integer. When rounding, if the fractional part is exactly 0.5, the direction of rounding can be chosen by the academic department independently for each grade. (For example, a grade of 37 on a scale of 100, when converted to a scale of 40, becomes 37 cdot 40 / 100 = 14.8 and will be rounded to 15.) Students Petya and Vasya received grades a and b, respectively, which are different from 0 and 100.

Similarly, b text{ out of } 100 as frac{b}{100}. Grades 0 and 100 will be called extreme points, represented as frac{0}{n} and frac{n}{n} respectively. Lemma 1: If the grading scale is sequentially reduced as 100 rightarrow 99 rightarrow 98 rightarrow ldots rightarrow 3 rightarrow 2, then any non-extreme grade frac{a}{100} will transform to frac{1}{2}. **Proof:** Consider the sequential reduction of scales: 1. Start with grade frac{a}{100}, where 0 < a < 100 (a non-extreme grade). 2. As the scale reduces from 100 to 99, the grade frac{a}{100} maps to frac{a cdot 99}{100}. This new value is approximated to the nearest whole number on the new scale. 3. Continuing this process, since we never hit extreme points during sequential reduction (0 or maximum), all intermediate grades remain non-extreme. 4. Eventually, the value gets rounded repeatedly and converges down to frac{1}{2} when reaching the grade scale of 2. By keeping the process distant from extreme grades, non-extreme grades stabilize at frac{1}{2} in the 2-point scale.

Lemma 3: Any odd value of the form frac{2r+1}{256} can map correctly within the interval left(a/100 - 1/200, a/100 + 1/200right) after scaling adjustments. **Proof:** Given frac{2r+1}{256} is a closer fraction in any viable scale range of transient changes: - Such fractional form fits into intervals as necessary. - Because the interval length 1/100 exceeds the consecutive span frac{1}{128} of our intermediary points, a contradiction implies that each value indeed aligns. Proof of Main Statement: - Initially, transform both a and b to frac{1}{2} on the 2 scale using Lemma 1. - With generated frac{1}{2}, use Lemma 2 to convert back to intermediary grades p/256 text{ and } q/256 respectively. - By precision and structure assured in Lemma 3, revert through scales verifying final grades a and b meet requirements on the initial scale.

The remaining two roles (etiquette and driving) can be assigned to any two of the remaining three volunteers (Xiao Li, Xiao Luo, Xiao Wang), which gives us binom{3}{2} = 3 ways to choose the two volunteers and 2! = 2 ways to assign the two roles to them.

Xiao Zhang can take either the translation or tour guide role. The remaining three roles can be filled by the three remaining volunteers (from Xiao Li, Xiao Luo, Xiao Wang), which gives us 3! = 6 ways to assign the roles.

Among any four mutually different numbers from this set, it is possible to form a geometric progression. We are required to prove that among these numbers, n of them must be equal. 2. Let's begin by assuming the contrary hypothesis that there are more than four pairwise different numbers among them. We will proceed to show a contradiction. 3. Consider grouping identical numbers together and then selecting one representative number from each group. Let's represent these selected numbers in a descending order as: [ a > b > c > d > e > ldots ] 4. According to the problem statement, the four largest numbers, a, b, c, and d, must form a geometric progression. Let’s analyze the implications. 5. In a geometric progression with terms (a), (b), (c), (d): - We must have ratios such that ( frac{b}{a} = frac{c}{b} = frac{d}{c} ). - This implies that ( a, b, c, d ) follows the properties of geometric progression in which [ ad = bc ] 6. Let’s test the consistency of this condition ( ad = bc ) considering the inequalities derived from their magnitudes and the initial assumption that they are all mutually distinct. 7. Note that for a, b, c, d forming a geometric progression: - Given ( a > b ), ( a > c ), ( a > d ) - ( b > c ), ( b > d ) - ( c > d ) 8. With these inequalities, let's consider product combinations: - Since ( a > b, c > d ), we see that ( ab > cd ) and ( ac > bd ). 9. Therefore, the condition ( ad = bc ) must hold. Considering this, any arrangement beyond this conflicts unless we pair similar groups maintaining ( ad = bc ), so rearrangement naturally confines to the same solution without increasing unique elements count beyond a specific limit. 10. Extending similar logic: [ e = frac{bc}{a} ] must hold as well due to the defined progression conditions. 11. Consequently, we find that for additional values holding true to same segmentations and progressions, the formulated constraint ( ad = bc ) logically extends. 12. Thus for original hypothesis failing larger distinct: - At least ( n ) values must bear redundancy for (4n) positive integer series to hold true under given progression and pairwise logic extensions. # Conclusion: By contradiction and logical consistency within geometric properties constraints derivation, we confirm among (4n) elements, (n) values necessarily repeat.

The total number of valid votes (V) is the sum of the votes for candidate X and candidate Y, so: V = 0.40V + (0.40V + 3000) Combining like terms, we get: V = 0.80V + 3000 Subtracting 0.80V from both sides, we get: 0.20V = 3000 Dividing both sides by 0.20, we find: V = 3000 / 0.20 V = 15000 So, there were 15000 valid votes cast.

When the bamboo pole is placed diagonally, it is exactly equal to the diagonal of the door. What are the height, width, and diagonal length of the door? If the length of the diagonal of the door is denoted as x feet, then the equation can be written as () A: (x4)^{2}+x^{2}=left(x+2right)^{2} B: x^{2}left(x2right)^{2}=left(x4right)^{2} C: (x+4)^{2}x^{2}=left(x2right)^{2} D: x^{2}+left(x+2right)^{2}=left(x+4right)^{2}","completion":"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the given conditions and translating them into mathematical expressions: 1. The bamboo pole is 4 feet longer than the width of the door. If the width of the door is w feet, then the length of the bamboo pole is w + 4 feet. 2. The bamboo pole is 2 feet longer than the height of the door. If the height of the door is h feet, then the length of the bamboo pole is also h + 2 feet. 3. When the bamboo pole is placed diagonally, it matches the diagonal of the door. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the diagonal of the door can be expressed as sqrt{w^2 + h^2} feet. Given that the length of the diagonal of the door is x feet, we can express the width and height of the door in terms of x: - The width of the door is x - 4 feet. - The height of the door is x - 2 feet. Now, we use the Pythagorean theorem to express the relationship between the width, height, and diagonal of the door: [x^2 = (x - 4)^2 + (x - 2)^2] Expanding the squares and simplifying, we aim to find the equation that matches the given options: [x^2 = (x^2 - 8x + 16) + (x^2 - 4x + 4)] Simplifying further: [x^2 = 2x^2 - 12x + 20] Rearranging the terms to find an equation that matches the given options: [x^2 - (x^2 - 4x + 4) = (x - 4)^2] This equation can be rewritten to match one of the given options: [x^2 - (x - 2)^2 = (x - 4)^2] Therefore, the correct option that represents the relationship between the width, height, and diagonal of the door, based on the given conditions, is: [boxed{B: x^2 - (x - 2)^2 = (x - 4)^2}]"},{"prompt":"For which values of the parameter ( a ) does the equation [ (a+1)(|x2.3|1)^{2}2(a3)(|x2.3|1)+a1=0 ] have exactly two distinct solutions?","completion":"Given the equation: [ (a+1)(|x-2.3|-1)^{2}-2(a-3)(|x-2.3|-1)+a-1=0 ] 1. *Set up a substitution*: Let ( t = |x-2.3|-1 ). Consequently, the given equation transforms into: [ (a+1) t^{2} - 2(a-3) t + a-1 = 0 ] 2. *Analyze the new equation in terms of ( t )*: Observe that: - When ( t < -1 ), the value ( |x-2.3|-1 ) is not possible, meaning there are no solutions for ( x ). - When ( t = -1 ), we have ( |x-2.3|-1 = -1 implies |x-2.3| = 0 implies x = 2.3 ). This presents one distinct solution for ( x ). - When ( t > -1 ), the absolute value expression corresponds to two different values of ( x ), thus providing two different solutions for ( x ). Hence, the equation ( (a+1) t^{2} - 2(a-3) t + a-1 = 0 ) can yield between zero to four solutions for ( x ). 3. *Determine the conditions for exactly two distinct values*: To have exactly two distinct solutions for the quadratic equation, one of the following three cases must hold: - The quadratic equation in ( t ) is linear (i.e., ( t ) equation has a single root greater than (-1)), - The quadratic equation has a double root (i.e., the discriminant ( D ) is zero) and ( t = text{double root} > -1 ), - The quadratic equation has two distinct roots, one of which is greater than (-1) and one less than (-1). 4. *Examine each case in detail*: **Case 1: Linear case (Single root greater than -1):** If the quadratic term equals zero, then: [ a+1 = 0 implies a = -1 ] Thus the equation simplifies to: [ 2(-1-3)t + (-1) - 1 = 0 implies -8t - 2 = 0 implies t = -frac{1}{4} ] Here, ( t = -frac{1}{4} > -1 ), hence ( a = -1 ) fits. **Case 2: Double root (discriminant ( D = 0 )) and ( t ) is greater than -1:** The discriminant ( D ) of the quadratic equation: [ D = [2(a-3)]^2 - 4(a+1)(a-1) = 4(a-3)^2 - 4(a^2-1) ] Simplifying, we get: [ 4(a^2 - 6a + 9) - 4(a^2 - 1) = 4a^2 - 24a + 36 - 4a^2 + 4 = -24a + 40 ] Setting ( D = 0 ): [ -24a + 40 = 0 implies a = frac{5}{3} ] The single root is: [ t = frac{a-3}{a+1} = frac{frac{5}{3} - 3}{frac{5}{3} + 1} = frac{-frac{4}{3}}{frac{8}{3}} = -frac{1}{2} ] As ( t = -frac{1}{2} > -1 ), ( a = frac{5}{3} ) fits. **Case 3: Two distinct roots ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ), one greater than -1 and the other less than -1:** Given the roots: [ t = frac{2(a-3) pm sqrt{D}}{2(a+1)} ] The quadratic roots formula becomes a necessity: [ t_1 t_2 = frac{a-1}{a+1} ] Let’s consider the conditions where the roots must be on separate signs from -1.

Prove that Andrey can write 10 consecutive integers on the board, then erase one of them, so that the sum of the remaining nine equals Ekaterina's number.","completion":"**Step 1:** Start by considering the sum of the first nine consecutive integers. Let's take an example starting from 1: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 ] Next, add 1 to the largest number (which was 9), and remove the largest number: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 10 = 46 ] **Step 2:** Continue this process by adding 1 to the next largest number and removing the next largest number each time. For instance, adding 1 to 8 and removing it: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 = 47 ] **Step 3:** We can keep doing this until all numbers in the range have been incremented by 1: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 48 ] [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 49 ] and so forth, up to: [ 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 54 ] **Step 4:** We observe that every time, we add 1 to a different number and eliminate the largest number that was added. Thus we can iterate through all natural numbers in this manner: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 11 = 55 ] **Step 5:** Notice the resulting sum will traverse all natural numbers. We could then reverse this process by subtracting 1 from numbers in sequence starting from the smallest number: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 ] **Conclusion:** Therefore, any integer number ( M ) that Ekaterina tells Andrey can be achieved by this method. Now, let’s prove this using a general solution: **Step 1:** Denote Ekaterina's number by ( M ). Let ( n ) be the smallest value in the series of 10 consecutive numbers written by Andrey: [ n, n+1, n+2, ldots, n+9 ] **Step 2:** The sum of these numbers is: [ S = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + cdots + (n+9) ] This sums up to: [ S = 10n + (0+1+2+cdots+9) = 10n + 45 ] **Step 3:** Andrey can erase any one number, say ( n+k ) where ( 0 leq k leq 9 ), so the resulting sum of the 9 remaining numbers is: [ S' = 10n + 45 - (n + k) = 9n + 45 - k ] **Step 4:** For ( S' = M ), we have: [ M = 9n + 45 - k implies M - 45 + k = 9n ] **Step 5:** We can always find such ( k ) that makes ( M - 45 + k ) divisible by 9. Essentially, we select ( k ) to be the remainder of 9 minus the remainder when ( M ) is divided by 9. Further, ( n ) will be an integer: [ n = frac{M - 45 + k}{9} ] **Conclusion:** This demonstrates that for any integer ( M ), Andrey will always find suitable ( k ) and ( n ) such that the sum of 9 remaining numbers equals ( M ).

According to the definition of the symmetric points, the orthocenter ( H ) of ( Delta ABC ) lies on this perpendicular bisector because ( A' ) is equidistant from ( H ) and ( B' ). - Similarly, draw the perpendicular bisector of the line segment ( A'C' ) and extend it.

Summing over (i), where there is 1 monic polynomial for (i = 0) besides ((p-1)p^{i-1}) monic polynomials for (i ne 0), gives us: [ |S_n| = 1 + sum_{i=1}^n (p-1)p^{2i-1} ] 4. **Equate and Solve for (d_i):** Set the two expressions for (|S_n|) equal and solve: [ sum_{i=0}^n d_i p^{n-i} = 1 + sum_{i=1}^n (p-1)p^{2i-1} ] Similarly, for (n+1): [ sum_{i=0}^{n+1} d_i p^{n+1-i} = 1 + sum_{i=1}^{n+1} (p-1)p^{2i-1} ] Subtract the two: [ sum_{i=0}^n d_i p^{n+1-i} - sum_{i=0}^n d_i p^{n-i} = p + (p-1)sum_{i=1}^n p^{2i} ] Simplify to: [ d_{n+1} = 1 - p + (p-1) sum_{i=1}^{2n+1} (-1)^{i+1} p^{i} ] 5. **Simplify the Expression for (d_{n+1}):** The expression simplifies via summation properties and the difference of sums: [ d_{n+1} = (p-1)^2 left( frac{p^{2n+2} - 1}{p^2 - 1} right) = frac{(p-1)(p^{2n+2} - 1)}{p + 1} ] 6. **Final Summation:** To find (sum_{i=0}^n d_i): [ begin{aligned} sum_{i=0}^n d_i = 1 + frac{p-1}{p+1} sum_{i=1}^n left( p^{2i} - 1 right) = 1 + frac{p-1}{p+1} left( -n + p^{2} cdot frac{p^{2n} - 1}{p^2 - 1} right) = 1 - n frac{p-1}{p+1} + frac{p^2 (p^{2n} - 1)}{(p+1)^2} end{aligned} ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{1 - n frac{p-1}{p+1} + frac{p^2 (p^{2n} - 1)}{(p+1)^2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Find all integer values of x and y that satisfy the equation ((2 x + 5 y + 1)left(2^{|x|} + x^{2} + x + yright) = 105).","completion":"We start with the equation: [ (2x + 5y + 1)left(2^{|x|} + x^2 + x + y right) = 105 ] Step 1: Analyze parity of both factors Considering that 105 is an odd number, both factors ((2x + 5y + 1)) and ((2^{|x|} + x^2 + x + y)) have to be odd numbers (since the product of two odd numbers is odd). Step 2: Determine the parity of ( y ) Since ( (2x + 5y + 1) ) is odd and ( 2x ) is always even, ( 5y + 1 ) must also be odd. For ( 5y + 1 ) to be odd, ( y ) must be even because the product of an odd number (5) and an even number (y) is even, and adding 1 makes it odd. Thus, ( y ) is even. Step 3: Analyze the expression ( 2^{|x|} + x^2 + x + y ) Notice that for ( 2^{|x|} + x^2 + x + y ) to be odd, ( 2^{|x|} ) and ( x^2 + x + y ) must together yield an odd number. Let's examine these components: - ( x^2 + x ) is always even for any integer ( x ), as it's the product of consecutive integers. - Since ( y ) is even, ( x^2 + x + y ) is even. - Therefore, ( 2^{|x|} ) must be odd to ensure the sum ( 2^{|x|} + x^2 + x + y ) is odd. Step 4: Identify ( x ) for which ( 2^{|x|} ) is odd The only value for ( x ) that makes ( 2^{|x|} ) odd is ( x = 0 ), because ( 2^0 = 1 ), which is odd. Step 5: Substitute ( x = 0 ) into the equation Substituting ( x = 0 ) into the original equation, we get: [ (2(0) + 5y + 1)(2^{|0|} + 0^2 + 0 + y) = 105 ] which simplifies to: [ (5y + 1)(1 + y) = 105 ] Step 6: Factorize and solve the reduced equation We need to find integer ( y ) such that the product ( (5y + 1)(y + 1) = 105 ).

This means each hectare of the neighbor's field can yield: [ 80 times 2 = 160 text{ corns every two months.} ] 3. **Total Yield for Neighbor's Two-Hectare Cornfield**: Since the neighbor has two hectares, and each hectare yields 160 corns every two months, the total yield for the neighbor's field every two months is: [ 160 times 2 = 320 text{ corns.} ] 4. **Combined Yield of Johnson and His Neighbor Every Two Months**: To find out how much corn they can harvest together every two months, we add Johnson's yield to his neighbor's yield: [ 80 + 320 = 400 text{ corns.} ] 5. **Total Harvest After Six Months**: Since there are three two-month periods in six months, the total corn they can harvest together after six months is: [ 400 times 3 = 1200 text{ corns.} ] Therefore, the total amount of corn they can harvest altogether after six months is boxed{1200} corns."},{"prompt":"Given that (f(x)) is an odd function defined on (mathbb{R}), and when (x < 0), (f(x) = x^2 2x + 1), represent the solution set of the inequality (f(x^2 3) > f(2x)) as an interval.","completion":"According to the problem, since (f(x)) is an odd function defined on (mathbb{R}), we have (f(0) = 0). When (x < 0), (f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x - 1)^2), which is a decreasing function. Therefore, when (x > 0), (f(x)) is also a decreasing function. Combining the above, we can conclude that (f(x)) is a decreasing function on (mathbb{R}). If (f(x^2 - 3) > f(2x)), then we have (x^2 - 3 < 2x). Solving this, we get (-1 < x < 3).

The semiperimeter s is given by s = frac{a + b + c}{2}. - Let X and Y be the projections of I and I_a on AB. Then, AX = s - a and AY = s. 4. **Relate the projections to the homothety ratio:** - From the projections, we have frac{AX}{AY} = frac{AI}{AI_a} = frac{s - a}{s}. - Using the fact that AI + II_a = AI_a, we get frac{II_a}{AI_a} = frac{a}{s - a}. 5. **Combine the ratios:** - From the homothety ratio r = frac{II_a}{AI_a}, we get r = frac{a}{s - a}. - Substituting this into the homothety ratio r = frac{BC}{MN}, we get frac{BC}{MN} = frac{a}{s}. 6. **Solve for MN:** - Since BC = a, we have frac{a}{MN} = frac{a}{s}, which simplifies to MN = s.

The dimensions of the unpainted part form a rectangular block with dimensions ((m-2) times (n-2) times (r-2)). 2. **Establish the Equation**: Given the block is completely painted initially and then cut into unit cubes, the problem states: [ m cdot n cdot r = 2 cdot (m-2) cdot (n-2) cdot (r-2) ] Let's rewrite this equation for further simplification. 3. **Simplify the Equation**: Divide the equation by (m cdot n cdot r): [ frac{m cdot n cdot r}{m cdot n cdot r} = frac{2 cdot (m-2) cdot (n-2) cdot (r-2)}{m cdot n cdot r} ] Simplifies to: [ 1 = frac{2 cdot (m-2)}{m} cdot frac{(n-2)}{n} cdot frac{(r-2)}{r} ] Rearranging: [ frac{1}{2} = frac{(m-2)}{m} cdot frac{(n-2)}{n} cdot frac{(r-2)}{r} ] 4. **Assume (m leq n leq r)**: This assumption allows us to analyze the inequality: [ left(frac{m-2}{m}right)^3 leq frac{(m-2)}{m} cdot frac{(n-2)}{n} cdot frac{(r-2)}{r} = frac{1}{2} < frac{(m-2)}{m} ] So: [ frac{1}{2} < frac{(m-2)}{m} leq sqrt[3]{frac{1}{2}} ] 5. **Range for m**: From the inequality: [ frac{1}{2} < frac{m-2}{m} < 1 ] This can be transformed into: [ m-2 > frac{m}{2} implies 2m - 4 > m implies m > 4 ] and, [ frac{1}{2} < frac{m-2}{m} leq sqrt[3]{frac{1}{2}} implies m < frac{m}{2} times sqrt[3]{frac{1}{2}} ] Therefore, we must have: [ 4 < m < 10 ] 6. **Fixing ( m ) and Solving for ( n ) and ( r )**: For each fixed integer ( m ) within the range ( 4 < m < 10 ), the equation: [ frac{m}{2(m-2)} = frac{n-2}{n} cdot frac{r-2}{r} ] must hold.

Let's break down the solution step by step. # I: 1. **Define the Variables**: Let the number of members in the group be (n). Since we are talking about a social group, (n geqq 2). 2. **Range of Possible Acquaintances**: Each member in the group can have anywhere from 0 to (n-1) acquaintances within the group. Therefore, the range of possible number of acquaintances for any given individual is: [ {0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1} ] 3. **Impossible Scenarios**: Note that it is impossible for one member to have 0 acquaintances and another to have (n-1) acquaintances at the same time. To understand why, consider if someone has (n-1) acquaintances, meaning they know everyone else in the group. Hence, no one in the group can have 0 acquaintances because everyone knows this person. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle**: Since there are (n) people in the group and at most (n-1) different numbers of acquaintances possible (considering the above argument), by the Pigeonhole Principle at least two people must have the same number of acquaintances. The Pigeonhole Principle states that if (n) items are put into (m) containers, with (n > m), then at least one container must contain more than one item. 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there exist at least two individuals in the group who have the same number of acquaintances.

This would mean every number from the set ({0, 1, ldots, n-1}) is utilized. This assumption is crucial because it sets up a contradiction. 4. **Removing a Member with 0 Acquaintances**: If one member has 0 acquaintances, removing this person from the group means the remaining (n-1) individuals have acquaintances numbered without 0. This set of numbers would then range from [ {1, 2, ldots, n-1} ] 5. **Contradiction**: However, removing a member who has 0 acquaintances, suggests that within the remaining (n-1) members, there should also be someone with 0 acquaintances as they now can’t know the removed member. Hence, this iterative removal strategy proves that there must be a duplication of acquaintance numbers among the group originally. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our assumption that each person has a distinct number of acquaintances is false.

According to the negation form of a universal proposition, we can write out the negation of the proposition. This problem tests the negation of propositions. The key to solving the problem is to master and understand the method rules for writing proposition negations. The negation of a universal proposition is a particular proposition, and the negation of a particular proposition is a universal proposition. Pay attention to the change of quantifiers when writing."},{"prompt":"polar coordinates, the point left(5, frac{pi}{3}right) corresponds to what other point in the standard polar coordinate representation? Provide your answer in the form (r, theta), where r > 0 and 0 leq theta < 2pi.","completion":"To find the equivalent point for left(-5, frac{pi}{3}right), we initially consider the negative radius which means reflecting through the origin. For a radius of -5 at an angle frac{pi}{3}, this reflection through the origin in polar coordinates results in changing the radius to positive and adding pi to the angle: 1. Change the radius to positive: r = -(-5) = 5 2. To find the new angle, add pi to frac{pi}{3}: [ theta' = frac{pi}{3} + pi = frac{pi}{3} + frac{3pi}{3} = frac{4pi}{3} ] Therefore, the point left(-5, frac{pi}{3}right) in polar coordinates transforms to boxed{(5, frac{4pi}{3})}."},{"prompt":"Consider the quadratic equation 8z^2 + 4iz m = 0, where z is a complex variable, i is the imaginary unit, and m is a complex constant.

[ r_1 + r_2 = frac{-4i}{8} = -frac{i}{2} ] [ r_1 r_2 = frac{-m}{8} ] Step 2: General form of roots Since r_1 + r_2 = -frac{i}{2} is purely imaginary, the real parts of r_1 and r_2 must be equal and opposite. Let’s express as: [ r_1 = a + bi quad text{and} quad r_2 = -a + (c - 0.5)i ] Step 3: Product of the roots Substituting the forms of r_1 and r_2: [ r_1 r_2 = (a + bi)(-a + (c-0.5)i) = -a^2 + a(c-0.5)i - abi - b(c-0.5)i^2 ] [ r_1 r_2 = -a^2 + b^2(c-0.5) + (ac - 0.5a - ab)i ] Equating to frac{-m}{8}: [ text{Real: } -a^2 + b^2(c-0.5) = text{Re}left(frac{-m}{8}right) ] [ text{Imaginary: } ac - 0.5a - ab = text{Im}left(frac{-m}{8}right) ] Step 4: Analyze for different m - If m is purely real, text{Im}left(frac{-m}{8}right) = 0 Rightarrow ac - 0.5a - ab = 0. Factorization gives potential relations. If m is real and negative, a and b must adjust to keep the real part of the product positive. - If m is purely imaginary, the real part equation indicates a contradiction unless a = 0 and b adjusts. Then roots are indeed purely imaginary. Conclusion: If m is a pure imaginary number, both roots are purely imaginary. The correct choice is text{D}.

We avoid numbers like 111, 222, ..., 999, as these don't fulfill the criteria (hundreds equals tens equals ones). Now, we focus on numbers where the hundreds place, tens place, and units place digits are strictly decreasing from left to right. For each digit in the hundred’s place h (1 to 9), we have choices for tens place t (from 0 to h - 1, excluding h itself) and further choices for the unit’s place u from (0 to t - 1, excluding t itself). Calculate the total: - for h=1, no valid t and u - for h=2, t=1 has u=0 - for h=3, t=1 has u=0, t=2 has u=0, 1 - ... - for h=9, count all valid (t, u) pairs This can be formalized with summation: [ sum_{h=2}^9 sum_{t=1}^{h-1} t ] Solving the nested summation, we calculate each t sequence: - when h=2, one option - when h=3, three options (t=1 gives 1, t=2 gives 2) - ... - when h=9, sum of 1 + 2 + ... + 7 + 8 = 36 Summing these, we get: [ 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15 + 21 + 28 + 36 = 120 ] Thus, there are boxed{120} three-digit numbers where each digit is strictly less than the preceding one."},{"prompt":"Linda throws seven identical darts.
