Avoid flowery prose and poetic analogies. Give names. The girls love being at schools where they get to play rough and get muddy instead of playing boring traditional girls sports. The mud is thick and sticky. Include dramatic and important events from the realistic match. Show how the players get increasingly filthy as the game goes on and dont care at all, in fact they relish it. Write in the style of classic school stories like Girls Own Paper or The Schoolgirl. The match is serious but the girls also enjoy playing and the tone should be lighthearted and not grimly serious.","completion":"In the small but spirited town of Ashfield, the annual rugby clash between the St. Helena’s Hawks and the Brackenridge Badgers was the highlight of the school sports calendar. As the girls laced up their boots beneath a foreboding sky, they knew the field at Bracken Park would soon turn into a battleground layered with an unforgiving blanket of mud. But for these young women, the grimier the game, the greater the glory. The whistle blew, and with a mighty kick, the Hawks launched the game into action. Within minutes, the pitch morphed into a treacherous quagmire, but that did not dampen the excitement that coursed through the players. The Badgers’ captain, Ellie “Bulldozer” Davies, plowed through the Hawks' defense, her kit becoming a canvas of splattered mud as she charged. But Hawks’ fullback, Charlotte \\"Chaser\\" Thompson, was quick to counter, gripping the slippery ball with determination etched on her mud-streaked face. Slipping, sliding, and with a fearless sparkle in their eyes, both teams pushed forward, their uniforms barely recognizable beneath layers of earthy adornments. The crowd roared with each daring tackle and breakaway sprint, as the girls from St. Helena's and Brackenridge reveled in the rough and tumble of the sport they loved, undeterred by the increasingly heavy mud that clung to them like a second skin. Spectators held their breath when \\"Fleet-foot\\" Fiona Smith from the Badgers made a darting run, weaving through the muck and defenders with agility that defied the sloshing ground beneath her feet. Fiona was close to scoring when out of nowhere, Hawks’ scrum-half, Jessica \\"Jinx\\" James, launched herself into a fearless slide tackle, stealing the ball and the chance for a try, leaving both players laughing as they emerged from a spray of muck. Halftime came with no score on the board, yet spirits were high. This was the kind of match that would be talked about for years, not for the score, but for the joyous abandon with which the game was played. As they returned to the pitch, there was no doubt that every player was ready to get stuck in—both to the game and quite literally to the field. The second half was just as thrilling, with play seeing the girls from both teams slipping and sliding, yet always getting back up with grins on their faces, mud splattered across their cheeks like badges of honor. When St. Helena's wing, Alex \\"The Comet\\" Cooper, finally broke the deadlock with a darting run down the sideline, the Badgers' supporters stood and applauded the superb display of skill and tenacity, rivalry forgotten in the face of such a spectacle. As the final whistle blew—with the Hawks prevailing 5-0—the true essence of the day had already been won. The girls, now indistinguishable with their jerseys caked in layers of the earth, shook hands and shared laughter, a testament to their shared love for the grit and earnestness of the game. Later, as they hosed off their boots and compared mud splatters, the tales of the day's chaos were cemented in school lore. There was Fiona’s masterful, muddy sprint; Ellie’s bulldozing runs; Charlotte's relentless defense; and Jinx's game-saving tackle. Each action was recounted with joy and pride, a story more about camaraderie and adventure than mere victory. Indeed, the girls of St. Helena's and Brackenridge took pride in being part of schools that embraced the mud, the thrill, and the essence of rugby, confirming that some traditions are best when they are joyously splattered with the evidence of play."},{"prompt":"Ex.15.

However, this should not be a problem since \`key\` is already a string. The real issue is the \`::update-current-input\` event handler; the \`update\` function is being used incorrectly. Given the definition of \`::update-current-input\`: \`\`\`clojure (rf/reg-event-db ::update-current-input (fn [db [_ input-value]] (update db :current-input str #(str % input-value)))) \`\`\` The mistake is in \`(update db :current-input str #(str % input-value))\`. The \`update\` function expects a function with a single argument (e.g., \`(update db :current-input #(str % input-value))\`), but you're using \`str\` as the function, which cannot be passed additional arguments via \`#(str % input-value)\`. The correct usage should not involve nesting functions. Instead, it should be: \`\`\`clojure (rf/reg-event-db ::update-current-input (fn [db [_ input-value]] (update db :current-input str input-value))) \`\`\` However, since the \`str\` function can concatenate strings directly, you don't need \`update\` here.

Your resultant \`global-key-handler\` function will correctly dispatch the event, and upon each keypress, the letter should be added to the current input. To ensure the \`global-key-handler\` function is working correctly in the browser, you might want to put additional \`println\` statements within the event handler to see the actual key being pressed. Lastly, make sure to attach your event handler (\`global-key-handler\`) to the window's \`keypress\` event after the DOM is ready. You're doing this in the \`init\` function, so that should be fine.

The \`::update-current-input\` event defines an anonymous function (within \`update\`) using the pound \`%\` symbol but incorrectly places \`str\` inside it: \`\`\`clojure (rf/reg-event-db ::update-current-input (fn [db [_ input-value]] (update db :current-input str #(str % input-value)))) \`\`\` The \`%\` symbol inside \`#(str % input-value)\` is meant to represent the current value of \`:current-input\` during the update operation, but the surrounding \`str\` function is incorrect here. ClojureScript interprets \`str\` as an anonymous function argument, which is then trying to be used as a function inside the anonymous function's body, leading to the observed output. Here's what you should do instead: use the anonymous function to properly concatenate the strings without the symbol mix-up: \`\`\`clojure (rf/reg-event-db ::update-current-input (fn [db [_ input-value]] (update db :current-input #(str % input-value)))) \`\`\` This \`update\` call will correctly concatenate the existing \`:current-input\` value with the new \`input-value\`. Make sure that all your other usages of event functions are consistent with this pattern. Also, always try to keep Clojure's core functions (like \`str\`) unshadowed by your definitions to avoid such issues."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This could likely be caused by an issue with how you're handling string concatenation or dispatching events in ClojureScript. In your \`global-key-handler\` function, you are currently creating strings using \`(str key)\` which might not be functioning as expected. Also in your \`update-current-input\` event, you might be creating a function instead of concatenating strings because of using \`str\` in an incorrect way: \`\`\`clojure (rf/reg-event-db ::update-current-input (fn [db [_ input-value]] (update db :current-input str #(str % input-value)))) \`\`\` Instead, you should be directly using the concatenated string with the \`input-value\`. The \`#(str % input-value)\` is creating a function, not a string. You should use: \`\`\`clojure (rf/reg-event-db ::update-current-input (fn [db [_ input-value]] (update db :current-input str input-value))) \`\`\` This ensures that \`str\` concatenates the current \`:current-input\` with \`input-value\`. If the issue persists, you may want to also check how rendering is handled to ensure that there are no issues with how the updated state is translated into the DOM elements, especially if your text input component is not reflecting state correctly. One more tip is to add some debugging statements to check the values you are working with at different points in the update process. This will give you insights into where the problem might be happening. Finally, make sure your subscriptions and components are rendering state correctly without any stale closures capturing outdated state. Since it might not be immediately obvious where the problem lies, please verify your code with these adjustments, adding console logs where appropriate, and step through the application flow to isolate the issue."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The heavens had opened up the night before, soaking the field to the bone and leaving a carpet of mud that awaited the teams with open, sludgy arms. The whistle blew, and Beth Thompson of Pendleton High caught the slippery ball, tucking it under her arm as she plowed forward, her boots squelching in the mud with every determined stride. Her teammates weren't far behind, each equally unbothered by the mud clinging to their school colors. They were warriors, battling for every inch on the field while their white and green jerseys became abstract art of brown and green. Marlowe Academy, in their bold blue and gold, were just as fierce, led by their unstoppable captain, Alex Hart. As the game progressed, neither team gave an inch, their camaraderie palpable even as they threw themselves into the muck of the contest with gusto. Laughter echoed over the grunts and the cheering crowd as bodies slid, tackles landed, and friendships were cemented in the shared love of the rough and tumble. Sarah \\"Sarge\\" Michaels, the prop for Pendleton, earned her nickname for the way she marshaled the scrum, anchored firmly in the mud, a true bulwark against Marlowe's onslaught. Her face was streaked with mud, a badge of honor she wore proudly, inspiring her teammates with her unyielding spirit. At the other end, Marlowe's wiry winger, Lizzie Vaughan, demonstrated her agility, dancing around defenders and leaving a trail of muddy spray in her wake. Despite her diminutive size, she played like a giant, slicing through the Pendleton defense for a critical try, only to emerge from the goal with a muddy grin plastered across her face. The scoreboard teetered back and forth, neither school able to secure a commanding lead. Every scrum seemed a chaotic amalgam of limbs and earth, and every line-out an opportunity for redemption. The match was hard-fought, with Pendleton's fly-half, Jenna 'The Boot' Carter, sending a penalty kick through the posts, the ball barely visible against the darkened sky. As the final whistle approached, with the scores tied and the spectators on the edge of their seats, muddy exhaustion was visible on every player's face. But their eyes sparkled with the sheer joy of the game. It was Sienna Powell, the usually quiet fullback for Pendleton, who broke the deadlock. With a sudden burst of energy, she intercepted a pass and charged down the field, evading tackle after tackle, her legs pumping furiously to keep her balance in the treacherous terrain. Her teammates roared her name as she crossed the try line, sealing the victory for Pendleton High. Marlowe's players, while disappointed, couldn't help but toast the conquering hero with claps on the back and promises of a rematch. Muddy, exhilarated, and victorious, the girls of Pendleton High formed a raucous circle, chanting their school song with exuberance. Across from them, Marlowe Academy joined in with a chorus of their own, their respect for the opposition clear. As they shook hands, the true winners were evident—not just Pendleton with the higher score, but every girl who reveled in the mud, the camaraderie, and the glory of having played their hearts out in a game they loved fiercely. The essence of this muddy contest wasn't merely about victory; it was about the unbridled passion for rugby that transcended the traditional expectations of girls' sports. It was about playing rough, getting muddy, and loving every minute of it. And as they walked off the field, they carried the mud as a trophy, a reminder of a day where school rivalries transformed into lifelong memories of the game that brought them all together."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

She was known far and wide for her beautiful pink fur and twinkling blue eyes. But what most of the other forest animals didn’t know was that Rosie was actually a slime shapeshifter. Rosie had the ability to change her form at will, morphing into any shape or creature she desired. She would often use her powers to play tricks on the other animals in the forest, appearing as a bird one minute and a squirrel the next. But no matter what form she took, Rosie always maintained her signature pink hue. One day, a group of mischievous raccoons decided to play a trick on Rosie. They spread a rumor throughout the forest that a dangerous beast was lurking in the woods, disguised as a harmless pink rabbit. The other animals were terrified and began to avoid Rosie, fearing that she was the supposed monster. Rosie was heartbroken by the sudden disdain from her fellow forest creatures. She knew she had to find a way to prove her innocence and win back their trust. So, she transformed into her true slime form, a shimmering pink blob with the ability to take on any shape. Using her shapeshifting abilities, Rosie created a magnificent display of shapes and creatures, dazzling the other animals with her creativity and skill. They watched in awe as she morphed from a majestic eagle to a graceful deer, proving once and for all that she was not the dangerous beast they had feared. The animals apologized to Rosie for misjudging her and welcomed her back into their community with open arms. From that day on, Rosie’s talents as a slime shapeshifter were celebrated and admired by all in the enchanted forest. And though she continued to play the occasional trick on her friends, they knew it was all in good fun and loved her just the same. Write a story where Max, a rabbit sees her in her blob form One sunny day in the enchanted forest, Max, a curious rabbit, was hopping along when he came across Rosie in her true slime form. At first, Max was taken aback by the shimmering pink blob that lay before him. But as he watched Rosie effortlessly shift from one shape to the next, he couldn’t help but be mesmerized by her talents. Max watched in awe as Rosie transformed into a beautiful butterfly, fluttering gracefully through the air. Then, with a quick shift, she became a fierce tiger, prowling through the underbrush with power and grace. Max couldn’t believe his eyes as Rosie continued to change into a variety of creatures, each more breathtaking than the last. As he watched Rosie’s incredible display of shapeshifting abilities, Max felt a sense of wonder and admiration wash over him. He realized that Rosie was truly unique and special, and he couldn’t believe that he had ever doubted her. After Rosie had finished her dazzling performance, she noticed Max watching her with a wide-eyed expression. She smiled warmly at the young rabbit and hopped over to greet him. “Hello, Max,” Rosie said in her soft, melodic voice. “I hope you enjoyed my little show.” Max nodded eagerly, his eyes still shining with amazement. “That was incredible, Rosie. I had no idea you could do all that!” Rosie chuckled softly. “Not many do, Max. I like to keep my true abilities a secret. But I’m glad you saw me in my slime form today.” Max smiled back at Rosie, feeling grateful to have witnessed such a magical display of talent. From that day on, he became fast friends with the pink rabbit, and together they had many adventures in the enchanted forest. And whenever Rosie felt like playing a trick on her friends, Max was always there to join in the fun, knowing that beneath her playful exterior, Rosie was a kind and talented soul. And he was proud to call her his friend. Write a story where he sees her relaxing, her bottom half melted into a pink puddle One lazy afternoon in the enchanted forest, Max was hopping through the trees when he stumbled upon Rosie lounging in a sunny clearing. To his surprise, Rosie’s bottom half was melted into a shimmering pink puddle, while her top half was propped up against a tree, basking in the warm sunlight. “Rosie, what are you doing?” Max asked, his ears perked up in curiosity. Rosie smiled sleepily at Max. “Oh, just soaking up some sun, Max. It feels so nice and warm on my slime form.” Max watched in fascination as Rosie’s pink slime body glistened in the sunlight, the puddle slowly rippling and shifting. He had never seen her in this relaxed state before, and he couldn’t help but be entranced by the way she seemed to melt into the ground. “Wow, Rosie,” Max said, his voice filled with wonder. “I had no idea you could do that. You’re like a beautiful, shimmering puddle of slime.” Rosie laughed softly. “Yes, Max. This is one of the many forms I can take with my shapeshifting abilities. It’s quite relaxing, actually.” Max sat down beside Rosie, feeling the warm sunlight on his fur as he watched her melt into the ground. He felt a sense of calm and contentment wash over him, and he knew that he was in the presence of something truly special. As they sat in the clearing, enjoying the peaceful moment together, Max realized just how lucky he was to have Rosie as a friend. She was not only talented and playful but also kind and gentle, with a beauty that shone from within. And as the sun began to set, casting a golden glow over the enchanted forest, Max and Rosie remained side by side, basking in the warmth and comfort of each other’s company. And in that moment, they knew that their friendship was a truly magical bond that would last for eternity. Write a story when she is in her rabbit form, Max asks her how was she a slime, was she born as one? One bright morning in the enchanted forest, Max and Rosie were out exploring together. Rosie had transformed into her sleek and fluffy rabbit form, her pink fur shimmering in the sunlight as she hopped gracefully through the trees. As they roamed through the forest, Max couldn’t help but be curious about Rosie’s true nature as a slime shapeshifter. He gently approached her, his ears twitching with curiosity. “Rosie, can I ask you something?” Max said, his voice filled with genuine interest. Rosie turned to face Max, her blue eyes bright with curiosity. “Of course, Max. What do you want to know?” Max shifted nervously on his paws before finally asking, “How were you able to become a slime? Were you born that way, or did something happen to make you like that?” Rosie smiled softly at Max’s question, sensing his genuine curiosity. She sat down on her hind legs, her fluffy ears perked up attentively. “Actually, Max, I wasn’t born as a slime,” Rosie began, her voice gentle and reassuring. “I discovered my shapeshifting abilities when I was just a young rabbit, exploring the depths of the enchanted forest. One day, I stumbled upon a hidden pool of shimmering pink slime, and when I touched it, I felt a surge of magic flow through me.” Max’s eyes widened in amazement as Rosie continued her story. He listened intently as she explained how the magical pool had granted her the ability to transform into any shape she desired, including the shimmering blob of slime that she had shown him. “Since that day, I have been able to shift between my rabbit form and my slime form at will,” Rosie finished, a warm smile on her face. “It’s a part of me that I cherish and embrace, and it’s what makes me unique in this enchanted forest.” Max gazed at Rosie with newfound awe and respect, marveling at the incredible story she had just shared with him. He realized that there was so much more to Rosie than met the eye, and he felt privileged to call her his friend. As they continued their journey through the forest, Max knew that he had a newfound appreciation for Rosie and her magical abilities. And he knew that their adventures together would only grow more exciting and wondrous with each passing day.

Title: 10K's Pondside Escapades On a hazy post-apocalyptic afternoon, where zombies groaned softer than the whispering breeze in the trees, 10K stumbled across a pristine oasis amidst the relentless decay of the Z Nation world—a pond that oddly remained untouched by the chaos that had consumed humanity. Stripping down to his birthday suit with comedic caution, 10K couldn’t help but admire the full spectrum of survival-toned muscles rippling beneath his tanned skin. Flexing jokingly at his reflection, he smirked, \\"Well, look at that. All zombie slaying and no carbs really does the body good, huh?\\" With a splash that disturbed the serene water, 10K waded in. As luck would have it, no creeping zeke seemed interested in a skinny-dipping sniper today. He began lathering his hair with an ancient bar of soap found in an abandoned store, \\"Operation Clean Slate is a go,\\" he quipped, scrubbing vigorously while the suds navigated the contours of his hair, now stuck to his head like a soapy helmet. Moving on to his chest, he worked up a froth that would put Santa's beard to shame. \\"If there's a Mrs. Clause in Zombieland, tell her I'm ready for the job interview!\\" he chuckled to himself, sliding soapy hands across the ridges of his abdomen. Then came the armpits, those rarely glorified yet essential components of the sniper life. \\"Pee-yew, even the dead would keel over again,\\" he joked while dancing his fingers through the frothy soap pits. The water around him shimmered with cleanliness, a testament to his thoroughness. Feeling a sudden rumble in his gut, 10K paused. \\"Must've been those apocalypse beans,\\" he mused before yielding to nature's call. With a wet and comical pfft, a stream of bubbles surfaced—the final flourish of an underwater symphony only a solitary sniper could appreciate. To his amazement and delight, a few lifeless fish appeared among the ascending bubbles, casualties of the gust he’d just let loose. \\"Dinner and a show. Man, am I talented or what?\\" he cheered, scooping up a fish with a triumphant grin. \\"Guess you didn't survive the Z-pocalypse to fall victim to 10K's butt trumpets, eh buddy?\\" Clutching his pond-caught prize, 10K emerged from the water, the droplets cascading down the landscape of his physique like the last vestiges of a world washed away. He announced to no one and everyone, \\"Along with precise aim and ninja silence, I can now add fisherman to my resume.\\" Wrapping a torn sheet around his waist and hoisting his precious catch, 10K looked back at the pond's ripple-free surface with a satisfactory nod, \\"Pond: 0, 10K: 1. And that's how you survive another day in Z Nation!\\" And so, with a gourmet fish swinging by his side, a fresh scent in his wake, and an apocalyptic sun setting on another bizarre day, 10K wandered off to rejoin his motley crew of survivors, the pond forever changed by one sniper's memorable cleansing escapade."},{"prompt":"Что такое профсоюз?","completion":"Профсоюз – это организация, объединяющая работников для защиты их социально-экономических интересов.

The minimum number of training samples (nSamples) per digit that I can train and test a Gaussian classifier with a full covariance matrix is 786. Specifically, the training algorithm will fail to train a Gaussian classifier with full covariance matrix using 785 samples due to curse of dimensionality. Then, using 786 training samples per class I train the following classifiers: a) Gaussian classifier with a full covariance matrix b) Gaussian classifier with a diagonal covariance matrix c) GMM classifier with 4 mixtures, each comprising a diagonal covariance matrix And the results of a) Gaussian classifier with a full covariance matrix is: train accuracy = 100%, test accuracy = 20.5%.

Results of c) GMM classifier with 4 mixtures, each comprising a diagonal covariance matrix is: test accuracy = 85.28%. Compare the accuracies achieved by these 3 classifiers. Which one is better? Briefly explain the result.","completion":"When comparing the three classifiers, it's important to consider both the training and test accuracies to determine their performance and generalization capabilities. a) The Gaussian classifier with a full covariance matrix achieved a training accuracy of 100% but a test accuracy of only 20.5%. This large discrepancy suggests that the classifier has overfit the training data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the model's performance on new data, which is what the test set represents. The impressive training accuracy can be attributed to the model's complexity, which allowed it to capture every nuance in the training set, but this complexity also caused it to fail when exposed to unseen data. b) The Gaussian classifier with a diagonal covariance matrix achieved a training accuracy of 84.39% and a test accuracy of 84.19%. The reduced complexity of the classifier, by assuming a diagonal covariance matrix (which implies that features are independent and have no correlation), prevented overfitting. The result is that it generalizes much better than the full covariance Gaussian classifier, as evidenced by the small gap between the training and test accuracies. c) The GMM classifier with 4 mixtures, each comprising a diagonal covariance matrix, achieved a test accuracy of 85.28%. This classifier offers even more flexibility than the single Gaussian with diagonal covariance due to the mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions. However, similar to the diagonal covariance Gaussian classifier, it assumes that within each mixture component, the features are uncorrelated. The test accuracy is higher than that of the solo Gaussian classifiers, suggesting better generalization to new data. In terms of generalization, which is the ability to perform well on unseen data, both the diagonal covariance Gaussian classifier and the GMM classifier with mixtures outperform the full covariance Gaussian classifier. Since we do not have training accuracy for the GMM classifier, we cannot fully assess its tendency to underfit or overfit based solely on the provided information. Nevertheless, when considering only the test accuracies—which are generally more important for evaluating the performance of a model on unseen data—the GMM classifier with 4 mixtures (85.28%) is slightly better than the Gaussian classifier with a diagonal covariance matrix (84.19%). Both are significantly better than the Gaussian classifier with a full covariance matrix (20.5%). Thus, if we had to choose the 'best' classifier among the three based on the given information, we would likely choose the GMM classifier with 4 mixtures due to its superior test accuracy, which implies a good balance between model complexity and generalization. However, it's essential to consider other factors such as computational cost and interpretability before making a final decision."},{"prompt":"write in paragraph form","completion":"Comparing the three classifiers based on their performance on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset reveals insightful differences. The Gaussian classifier with a full covariance matrix, despite achieving perfect training accuracy, severely underperformed on the test set with only 20.5% accuracy. This vast gap clearly indicates overfitting, where the classifier is too complex, capturing noise and specific details of the training data that do not generalize well to unseen samples. In stark contrast, the Gaussian classifier with a diagonal covariance matrix showed robust generalization, reflected in the close training (84.39%) and test accuracies (84.19%). By assuming independence among features, this model avoided the overfitting pitfall and maintained consistent performance across both datasets. The GMM classifier with 4 mixtures and diagonal covariances improved slightly upon this, delivering the highest test accuracy of 85.28%, although its training accuracy was not reported. By blending multiple Gaussian distributions, the GMM probably captured the variability among the handwritten digits more effectively while still avoiding overfitting through the use of diagonal covariance matrices within each mixture component. Based on the test accuracies, the GMM classifier is the best performer, indicating a good balance of model flexibility and generalization capacity. However, it's important to weigh other influences like computational demands and interpretability in practical applications. Fundamentally, the smaller the gap between training and testing accuracy, the better the model generalizes; hence, in this scenario, the diagonal Gaussian and GMM classifiers are more suitable choices than the full covariance Gaussian classifier."},{"prompt":"Please write an exciting sports story about a very muddy rugby match between two rival girls schools.

As the girls lined up on the pitch, the heavens opened up, turning the ground into a swampy battlefield. It was clear from the outset that it wouldn’t just be a test of skill, but also a struggle against the elements. Lisa Harper, captain of the Harriers, boisterously rallied her team with a hearty shout. \\"Let's show them what we're made of, Harriers!\\" Her counterpart, Samantha \\"Sam\\" Green of the Tigers, fiercely nodded in agreement, her eyes gleaming with competitive fire. The whistle blew, and the match began with a squelch. The ball, slick and slippery, was immediately claimed by a Tigers’ forward. As Thornfield charged ahead, there was an almost audible squish from the players' boots sinking into the mud. The first try was a result of sheer power and agility by the Harriers’ winger, Emily Peters. She dashed through the Tigers' defense, her kit gradually transforming from bright blue to a dark brown as the mud splattered upward with every determined sprint. The field erupted with cheers, the Harriers leading 5-0. Thornfield refused to be cowed. With a spirited counterattack, their scrum-half Zoe Chang deftly scooped the ball from the ruck and darted through a gap. She was tackled, but the ball was swiftly taken up by Sam Green, who ploughed through to equalize with a magnificent leap over the try line. 5-5, and the crowd went wild. The match continued with breakneck intensity. The girls' fervour for the game was clear – none minded the muddy conditions. Rather, they relished the extra challenge, faces streaked with grime as they clashed and tumbled, scrambling for the ball. Ingram's Jasmine Price, normally a reserved fullback, came into her own in the muck. She parried a would-be tackler and ploughed ahead, leaving a trail of befuddled Tigers in her wake before passing the ball to Harper who scored a gritty try, putting the Harriers ahead again. By the second half, the pitch had turned into a veritable quagmire. Each step was met with resistance, each fall left a player caked in another layer of sludge. Yet, spirits were undiminished, and the laughter of the girls mingled with cheers from the onlookers. As time ticked down, Thornfield mounted a fierce comeback, their determination evident in the clumps of earth that flew from their driving scrums. With just minutes remaining, it was Annika Lee, the Tigers' determined second-row, who bulldozed her way over the line to draw the match level yet again. The final minutes were a chaotic dance of slipped grips and gritty resolve. With both teams dead-locked, a penalty was awarded to the Harriers for an offside infringement. The crowd held its breath as Lisa Harper teed up the ball. Caked in mud from head to toe, her focus was unyielding. She kicked, the ball sailed through the uprights, and the Harriers claimed victory by a narrow three points! The final whistle blew, signaling the end of a match that would be spoken of for years to come. The scoresheet read Ingram High Harriers 13 - 10 Thornfield Academy Tigers. As the teams shook hands and exchanged mud-splattered pats on the back, their shared love for the game, for the rough-and-tumble chaos and the joy of the sport, was evident. Their grins, as wide as the pitch was long, could be seen even through the splatters of earth that adorned their faces. It was a day both teams would remember, for the match played not with traditional delicacy but with a fierce joy; a celebration of what it meant to be playing, laughing, and living, in the thick and sticky mud of the rugby field."},{"prompt":"please write some dialog between the girls in the changing room afterwards. they discuss exciting moments from the match, praise and tease each other and joke about how muddy it was","completion":"Inside the bustling changing room of the Ingram High Harriers, the echoes of laughter and the pounding of the showers created a symphony of post-match merriment. The girls were shedding their saturated, mud-caked uniforms, leaving a trail of grime on the floor. Lisa Harper playfully tossed her muddy cleats into the corner and turned to Emily Peters, her voice laden with glee, \\"Emily, you were an absolute beast out there! That dash down the wing? I'm convinced you sprouted wings in that mud!\\" Emily grinned, trying to towel the mud from her hair, \\"Wings? More like jet engines! I didn't realize I could skate on mud so well.\\" She winked, then nudged Jasmine Price who was nearby. \\"And Jas, that break through their line—I swear half the field is still clinging to you!\\" Jasmine shook her head, flicking clods of mud off her arm, \\"Yeah, I reckon I'm taking half the pitch home with me. If I get any heavier with mud, I might as well become a permanent fixture!\\" Samantha Green of the Tigers, emerged from one of the showers, overhearing Jasmine. \\"Hey, don't hog it all,\\" she laughed, \\"we're hoping to plant potatoes in that field come spring!\\" The room erupted in laughter before Tanya Morris, the Harriers' prop, chimed in, \\"Annika, that tackle you made on me was so epic, I'm gonna be finding mud in my ears for weeks!\\" From a nearby bench, Annika shrugged with a mischievous smile, \\"Well, I had to do something to make sure we weren't the only ones with a laundry disaster post-game.\\" Chloe Benson, sitting on the bench, added with a chuckle, \\"I don't think there's enough detergent in the world for this mess.\\" She held up a jersey that was more brown than white. Lisa, pulling a clean t-shirt over her head, turned to Sam, extending a hand, \\"You Tigers really gave us a run for our money. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a game this much!\\" Sam clasped her hand firmly, shaking it with camaraderie. \\"Your kick at the end was pretty clutch, Lisa. But just wait until next time! We'll be ready for you.\\" \\"Next time, we'll make sure the weather's on our side so we can see how you Harriers handle a dry pitch,\\" quipped Zoe Chang, as she struggled to wriggle a particularly stubborn rugby boot off her foot. \\"Yeah, I reckon we'd all appreciate a little less mud sliding and a bit more rugby playing!\\" said Lisa, her tone light-hearted. \\"But you gotta admit, this was one heck of a memorable game.\\" As the banter continued, with each girl recounting heroic scrambles and laughter-inducing slips, the sense of camaraderie and shared love for the game was palpable. Covered in mud, they had battled fiercely as rivals on the pitch, yet here in the changing room, they bonded as fellow athletes who had given their all to the sport they loved."},{"prompt":"One of the girls enters a magazine competition. she has to write a lighthearted entertaining 2000 word essay on \\"something i love about my sport\\". she decides it would be fun to write about getting muddy. please write the essay she enters. she loves that she is not just allowed to get muddy but is expected to get muddy","completion":"**Muck and Grit: Playing Dirty in Rugby** There’s an unwritten rule in sports: stay clean, stay composed, and whatever you do, avoid staining that spiffy uniform. Well, in the spirit of breakaways, breakdowns, and earthy tackles, I’m here to tell you about the joy of tossing that rule into the mud—quite literally. Yes, I’m talking about rugby, and more specifically, the delightful, liberating, and downright hilarious aspect of getting covered head-to-toe in good ol’ fashioned mud. From wide-eyed spectators to grizzled veterans, many sports enthusiasts purport that grace on the field comes from the elegance of movement, the precision of footwork, all in immaculate attire. Yet, ask a rugby player, and they’ll likely paint a different picture—a picture smeared with brown, sticky glory. Here, at the heart of rugby, is where getting muddy isn’t just a side effect of the game; it’s an expectation, a rite of passage, and believe it or not, it’s what I love most about the sport. Picture this: the whistle blows, signaling the start of the match. The first thing you notice isn't the usual sounds of cheers or the refs’ vocal commands, but the squelch, the visceral suction sound of boots plunging into the wet earth, pulling free only to plunge down again, each step warding off the turf's greedy grasp. The more pristine your jersey, the more it screams \\"fresh target!\\" And with the game properly underway, that clean slate becomes an artist's canvas, painted not in gentle watercolor strokes, but in bold splatters of the field itself. As a player, the inevitable grime is oddly empowering. It means I'm working, I'm engaged, I'm part of the living battlefield that the rugby pitch becomes. There’s a certain abandon when you leap for a tackle, knowing both you and your opponent are going to come up decorated in a new layer of the earth. It’s not a deterrent; it's a motivator. The more intense the game, the less of the original color of my jersey I can see. This love for mud-slinging mayhem isn’t bred from a disdain for cleanliness, but rather from what the mud symbolizes in the sport I hold dear. Each splotch, splash, and smear marks an action, a moment where commitment met execution. A muddied uniform is storytelling through stains; those blended tones whisper tales of try-saving tackles, of slipping through grasping fingers to cross the try line, and of rucks and mauls fought with comrades-in-arms (or should I say, legs, torsos, and the occasional winging elbows). And let’s not forget camaraderie. If you’ve ever sat down to a team meal post-match, you'll witness a level of friendship only muddy jerseys can cultivate. There’s a shared sense of achievement that runs deeper than the dirt under our fingernails, bonding players through the shared pursuit of victory—and shared laundry challenges. We toast to the day’s mud masks and mud pies, each patch of grime a reminder that we leave it all on the pitch, and we do it together. Then we have the joy of defying expectations. In a world that often polices how \\"ladies\\" should maintain their appearance, rugby challenges the narrative. It’s liberating. To slather oneself in the thick of the game, to revel in the grit, is to confront and dismantle the box society tries to put women in. It’s exhilarating to trade concern over smudges for strategic smashes, to replace the dainty with the dauntless. Perhaps what I cherish about my mud-caked excursions is the authenticity it brings to the sport. Rugby isn’t about maintaining an image; it’s about raw, unfiltered passion. When I’m racing down the field, eyes set on the oval prize, the last thing on my mind is avoiding the muck. It’s about embracing every element, including the earth that adds to the tale of the game. It’s not to say that rugby with its inherent messiness lacks strategy, discipline, or skill. Rather, it fully embraces them, while also welcoming the natural, the wild, and the genuine enthusiasm for vigorous play. Rugby, particularly in its most muddied form, is the epitome of living in the moment, of giving it your all without reservation or pretense. So, here’s to the muddy encounters, to the drenched and soiled jerseys, to the gritty eyes and the earthen teeth grins. My love for this sport burgeons with every speck of terra firma that finds its way onto my kit because it’s not about staying spotless—it’s about playing with heart, with gusto, and sometimes, with a whole lot of the great outdoors. Rugby isn't clean; it isn't meant to be. It's chaotic, it's beautiful, and it's gloriously muddy. And that’s exactly the way I love it."},{"prompt":"К 1 литру раствора серной кислоты (массовая доля 0,3 и плотность 1,13 г/мл) добавили 196 грамм этой же кислоты.

The Gaussian classifier with a diagonal covariance matrix came in second with a test accuracy slightly lower at 84.19%. The Gaussian classifier with a full covariance matrix performed poorly on the test set, with an accuracy of only 20.5%, despite achieving 100% training accuracy. Let's analyze these results in more context: 1. **Gaussian Classifier with Full Covariance Matrix (a)**: The model achieved perfect accuracy on the training set, which is an indication of overfitting—when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and thus fails to generalize to new data. The low test accuracy suggests that the model did not capture the true underlying distribution but rather focused too much on the peculiarities of the training set. Another reason for the poor performance could be the \\"curse of dimensionality\\" that you mentioned. With 785 or fewer samples, the model would fail due to not having enough data to estimate the full covariance matrix. While 786 samples are technically sufficient, it is the minimum number, and it's clear from the test performance that it's still not enough to prevent overfitting and allow the model to generalize well. 2. **Gaussian Classifier with Diagonal Covariance Matrix (b)**: When the covariance matrix is assumed to be diagonal, each feature is assumed to be statistically independent of the others, and each feature’s variance is estimated separately. This simplification reduces the number of parameters the model needs to estimate and helps to mitigate overfitting. The accuracies achieved on both the training and test sets are close, which suggests that the model has generalized well to unseen data. The simplification made by assuming a diagonal covariance structure prevented the severe overfitting seen with the full covariance Gaussian classifier. 3. **GMM Classifier with 4 Mixtures with Diagonal Covariance Matrices (c)**: GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) is a probabilistic model that assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, each with its own mean and covariance. By using 4 mixtures, the model is able to capture more complex patterns in the data than a single Gaussian distribution. The advantage of using mixtures is that each mixture component can model different types of handwriting or styles within the same digit class, which can be quite heterogeneous. The use of a diagonal covariance matrix within each mixture avoids overfitting, similar to the single Gaussian classifier with a diagonal covariance matrix. The GMM classifier's superior test accuracy indicates that it has struck a good balance between model complexity and generalization. It is flexible enough to capture different variations within the data but not so complex that it overfits the training data. In summary, the GMM classifier with 4 mixtures and diagonal covariance matrices performed the best because it offered a good compromise between a model's flexibility to capture the different handwriting variations in the data and its capacity to avoid overfitting. The Gaussian classifier with a diagonal covariance matrix also performed well and was much better than the full covariance Gaussian classifier, which suffered from severe overfitting."},{"prompt":"напиши актуальность включения клетчатки в рацион питания","completion":"Включение клетчатки в рацион питания имеет огромное значение для поддержания здоровья организма.

Clouds Holding her closer to his pulse, Max stood against the metallic wall of the NICU; her fluttering heartbeat was steady and reassuring. “Hey, beautiful, I suppose it’s just you and me now. But we’ll be alright; I promise you. Despite all your suffering, you’re still far more resilient than your old man.” He paused, suddenly feeling his mere twenty-six years of life weighing on his frame as he offered equilibrium to her dependent, innocent youth as she gazed up at him. Her hazel irises stared intently into his matching brown and amber aspect, and a smile crossed his lips. “My God, I can’t believe you’re already five days old, and rest assured, sweetheart, you’re the most precious thing I have in this world.” His voice trailed off as his gaze lingered on her translucent skin, her veins shining under the soft light. “And you’re so gorgeous, so incomprehensible; I—I can’t quite believe you are alive. A little fighter, and brave as hell, too.” Exhausted but at peace with her fitting perfectly between his wrist and forearm, he sighed with a profound sense of fulfillment and redemption. Standing placated in the encroaching dusk, as he pulled her closer against his chest, his gaze drifted to the glass window beyond him. Amidst the fading light that outlined buildings and wisps of smog, he felt a sense of perishing hope; one that he clung to with grit and resolve, if only for her sake. As he gently traced her delicate features with his finger, she reached up and hooked her index finger over his thumb, creating a fragile but powerful lifeline, transpiring through the grim backdrop of her makeshift nursery. “Lily bean, your mother, she—” He hadn’t the words nor the heart to continue as her intricate grasp on his slid away, her hand splaying across her chest as she slipped into slumber. “You can sleep; there’ll be plenty of time to stare at this mug in the morning.” He exhaled with relief and wonderment as her consciousness seemed to melt away into the bleak atmosphere. As her breathing then fell against his palm, it was a soothing rhythm, leaving him stupefied in the peaceful lull of the ebb and flow. ,“Why must you look like her? Well, you may actually resemble me, and now that’s not so great, huh?” Max smiled at her oblivion, which he prayed would not betray her someday. “Don’t you dare wake up yet,” he muttered, her sleeping form realigning itself against him, seeming to sense his presence as her pulse slowed. Unable to even move, Max stood with the sleeping infant, too exhausted to lay her down in the clinical humidicrib of sallow light that hummed with a disconcerting tone. Overwrought with fatigue yet savoring the fleeting moment of solace, he willed it to engulf him in its embrace. Although it tore incremental fragments from his being, it was solace all the same. After a nurse finally intervened, alleviating Max of his daughter and leaving him to his own devices , he was caught in a suspended network of disconnected wires, live endings strewn through his brain. Not daring to seek unconsciousness yet, not until visiting hours drained away , Max steeled himself against the wall near the disconcerting crib , as her agonised cries shot jarringly through him. The solace had only lasted a few hours, already her frail health was causing her distress. But she was breathing , and recalling her birth , he sighed in lament. As her cries continued , he was haunted by just how vital they were , despite conveying pain. The sound shrouded his mind as he revisited her first cry, only closing his eyes to let the torture invade him. The room , dimly lit and filled with tension, held a measured focus and intense energy that enveloped them both. “That’s it, Elara, one more push…” a voice encouraged from the far distance, as the room seemed to fall away, the space between them growing closer. Max felt her hand interweave with the hair at the nape of his neck as she wound her fingers against his scalp. Following her electrifying pull downward, he rested his lips against her flushed cheek. She was radiating strength, exertion, and euphoria as her fingertips grazed his wrist and he grabbed her hand. “You’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered roughly into her ear as she smiled through clenched teeth, his voice sending shocks of empowerment down her spine. Then as she fell back into his chest, his gleaming stare finding hers, a nurse’s voice pierced the intimate, enclosing air. “The head is crowning, keep going, Elara.” The atmosphere was punctured with her gasps as she bore down, resting her head in the hollow of Max’s neck as he held his gaze steady on their child’s emerging head and she inhaled, her resolve faltering as she whispered, “Max, I can’t.” “You are, Elara, her head is almost out,” Max murmured in a subdued mix of pride and awe. In a rush of amniotic fluid and blood, their daughter’s head emerged along with her left shoulder, but the fight was far from over. “Elara , the umbilical cord needs to be cleared from her neck. I need you to slow things down for me . Don’t push. Pant , Elara. Pant.” The room stayed engulfed in silence as Elara’s hand searched for a solid foundation, anchoring itself in Max’s shirt as she trembled against the force of her next contraction. “Max-I” she gasped out between deep pants of desperation , her hold on his shirt whitening her knuckles. “Just focus on my voice , Elara . Pant through it. She’s so close.” Max encouraged , as the nurse slipped the cord from the child’s head and instructed with a calm but assertive tone. “Great job, Elara , now push your baby out. A few nice deep breaths for me. And on three…One. Two… “ As the pressure consumed her, Elara delivered one final push, grunting as primal effort raged through her . As the body slid out, and a nurse’s hands caught their child, relief washed over Elara’s senses and she collapsed deeper onto Max’s chest. “You did it, baby, she’s here.” Max affirmed in a quiet rasp. But the silence of the room stretched on, and their worst fears were confirmed, Elara’s panting breaths the only audible sound. “She’s not respiring, clear her airways,” another voice instructed with an urgent tone, and Elara turned her head towards Max in sheer panic. “What’s happening? Our baby - she’s?” Just as fear clawed through Max’s weathered eyes, a nurse placed her fragile, violet body onto Elara’s chest. “The skin-to-skin contact will help her take that first breath. Hold your baby, Elara.” Her hands, still shaking, enclosed around her daughter as she rubbed her back, her blue gaze filled with worry. “Come on baby girl, fill those lungs,” Max urged, his breath hitching in his throat. Then, as they both waited in anticipation, a cry broke out into the air. “Oh thank goodness,” Elara laughed through tears as the crying continued, and Max felt the moment stand still, bound in sheer relief, the sound more reassuring than anything he’d heard in a long time. “Hey gorgeous,” Max greeted his daughter before pausing, a smile breaking across his face, “what are we going to name her, can’t call her ‘gorgeous’ forever…” Elara laughed with exhaustion, “Max, you know the name we chose, trust you to forget when she actually gets here…” Max quickly responded, jest in his voice, “I did no such thing. Welcome to the world, Lily. A bit sooner than we expected, but you’re finally here, huh?” Her crying slowed and under Elara’s palm, she found a moment of solace, her tiny lungs regulating her breaths and her cries stopped. Just as Max collapsed his weary arms around Elara, gazing at their slightly premature infant, her breathing slowed to an almost rasping cough, and she was quickly whisked from Elara’s hold. “Her pulse is dropping again. Begin resuscitation…blood volume rising., stabilising…” Feeling the weight of the triumph turn to defeat and fear, Max rested his head on Elara’s shoulder, “No-“ Elara buried her head in the curve of his shoulder, confused and unable to catch her breath after hours of labor, and now her child was unreachable yet again. “Please let her be alright-“. Max ran a hand through her damp, unkempt hair , combing strands from her forehead , waiting to hear cries in the distance, but the silence returned , more sinister than before . “Elara, she’s stable , but your daughter is being transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit, her heart rate dropped a little low , and we just need to ensure her stability. You can rest a moment than you may see for yourself that she’s alright. She’s a strong little fighter, Max. You should both be proud. “ The nurse rubbed a firm hand over Elara’s shaking chest, and nodded at Max with assurance. Embracing Elara , they stayed locked in a shared moment of uncertain resolve. The next hours would be critical , and Elara let her tears fall as Max rested his chin atop Elara’s dark hair , sighing as his eyes drifted into the distance. It had been a long, dragging night of insomnia, flashbacks, and a lack of food as Max leaned his spine against the hospital corridor. There, he had set up a vigil, not leaving the hall as he watched her in his peripheral vision. “How could Elara abandon the poor kid? How could she just—” As he ran a calloused hand over his unshaven jaw, Max contemplated the impending call that suffocated his tattered psyche. It was the inevitability encroaching on his raw nerves as his fingers unlocked his phone with trepidation and scrolled for her number. “Elara? I don’t know. You discharged yourself; no, I don’t care where the hell you are—she can’t survive on air. No, but please just tell me what I can do to fix—No, of course I love you. I’m alone in a hospital with our—well, my daughter.” The phone went dead in his ear, and he let it backflip into his lap with resignation. Returning to his haphazard scattering of belongings, he pried open an energy drink, drained it, and then crushed the aluminum under his fingers; the distorted metal absorbed his anguish and dismay. All his disbelief and heartbreak over Elara seemed weightless, meaningless, and forgotten as he heard Lily’s almost inaudible whimpers floating in the air. “Right here, Lily, I’ve got you,” his hoarse voice found her, and her fussing stopped in an instant. His softening voice whispered intangible phrases; he half-sang, his deep-throated hum off-balance from his persistent fatigue. A lullaby of his own, off-key, intermingled with her cries, permeated the space between them. His eyes floated shut, and images filled his mind: cowering under creaking stairs as the weight above him lurked closer, his young screams pleading for mercy. “I didn’t mean to, Dad—” Suddenly, everything grew colder, then a fierce heat drove through him, making him flinch at the recollection. A boot sailed past his head; then a knife. Falling to his knees, petrified, he soon felt the lurid warmth of urine saturating the tongues of his shoes, filling the perforated leather with liquid. His head hung in shame and degradation. “Max, now I will have to punish you for ruining my floorboards, son.” As Max felt a dark shadow encompass his juvenile mind, he cried even harder, shaking like an untethered string. A balloon burst under the thud of a boot, and he yelled in confusion, “Is it because of my birthday party? I didn’t want to turn five anyway! I’m sorry…” Max reopened his eyes, back in the present once more, his pulse thudding out of sync with his infant daughter’s. Her accelerated heartbeat still seemed steadier than his own. “I’m sorry you’ll be in here a while longer. Can’t take you home yet. But you’re gonna love your own crib. It’ll put this humidifier to shame. You just wait and see…” With a heavy weight in his lungs, almost drowning him with the proximity of his flashback, his mind flickered to Elara. Holding the still-crying Lily, determined to soothe her discomfort in the cool night, he could still taste Elara, feel her in his clothes, and it sickened him . As he placed Lily into her contraption of a crib with reluctance, he sank against the wall, exhausted . He had to fight the torrent of frustration that tore through his clenched teeth as he reached for his phone the second time that day. “Pick up, please… Elara? Oh, God, just tell me why—No, I haven’t slept; she’s in a critical condition. Don’t worry about it. I know it’s heartbreaking. What, so I’m not going through hell right now? No, please, I’m sorry—” Again, the line died out in the shell of his ear, wrenching a twist of agony through his stomach. Exhaustion gnawed at his brain, and he relented to sleep as it finally proceeded , like a tower of building blocks smashing down upon him. “No, Max, I—it’s because I love her that I can’t watch her suffer…” Elara’s tear-stained blue gaze pierced into his as she stood under the harsh lights of the parking lot. Like a deer in headlights, her frightened expression held an acceptance of fate. Max, reaching out and grabbing her wrist, infused his pleas of incredulity into the closing space between them. “Elara, please, I love you, but I love my child, damn it… And I’ll be standing there watching when she takes her last breath. If that’s how this ends…so be it. ” Elara’s torn expression ripped at his heart as he conceded the truth. “Say it, Elara… Just put me out of my misery. Because what is it that we can’t work through? What has happened to us? That you’ll leave me here with our child?” After a long, wrenching silence, she whispered, “I love you. Nothing is wrong with us, Max, but if I lose her, I won’t be the person you fell in love with. I won’t even want to know myself. I… I’d rather pretend in my mind she’s going to survive this—” He interrupted her, anger and frustration gnawing at him. “What if she survives this? Then what will she have? . This is the definition of selfishness, Elara, and you know that. Just go… This here is what’s breaking us.” As he lifted his gaze, she was already walking away, her head in her hands. The streetlight flickered out for a moment, and he was swallowed by darkness, sinking as the concrete seemed to embrace him when he fell. His pulse raced to the surface of his throat as he retched himself into stark consciousness, gazing around in sheer panic. He ran a hand over his drawn features. Upon hearing his child’s faint breathing—a newfound white noise that salved his frayed nerves—he relaxed against the wall. Six weeks had passed, and Max had been offered respite housing by the hospital, where he had relocated his sparse belongings. The imprint of his spine against the wall had almost been visible when a social worker assigned him a bare-boned apartment with a single bed and central heating. This particular morning, his clothes were fresh, and his face clean-shaven as he entered the NICU and locked eyes with his daughter. “Morning, Gorgeous.” The mild rays of morning bled into the room, embracing her in a blanket of warmth, the humidicrib encasing his daughter with a plastic film of isolation. He staggered over to where she lay and lifted her into the air. “My little girl is six weeks old. I swear you’re growing bigger every single day.” With grit under his nails and darkness pooling under his eyes—an accumulation of the passing days—he beamed at Lily with awe, relief, and pride. Holding Lily in his outstretched arms, the golden light outlined her body, bathing her in an aura of warmth. As he stared into her irises, mesmerized, a gentle smile broke out across her lips, reaching her gaze and filling it with specks of recognition and joy. “You’re smiling,” he laughed, a surge of pure elation coursing through him. “Of course, you’re smiling, because you know I love you, right?” His own deep hazel eyes glazed over, and he was unable to look away. His daughter, in an exuberant moment free from agony, maintained her entrancing grin, and his arms trembled as he lowered her onto his forearm, holding her close. “Your first smile, perhaps? I’ll have to ask the nurses… they’ve taken such phenomenal care of you. You’ll be at home before you even know it.” Her invigorated breathing, steady and strong against his skin, gave him something palpable to focus on as he lamented the grave reality and cursed under his breath. “I miss her, you know, but I worry about her, too. Maybe someday she’ll find her way back to us. But I’ll be here for your first word, first step. You’re gonna come on jogs with me, huh? Yeah, that’s right, you are.” Max, beaming with admiration and genuine excitement, felt a weight lift from his shoulders that had almost clung like shrink wrap to his existence. Lily was coming through the ordeal of being born with weak organs, and while she still seemed vulnerable, she shone with fighting spirit. “You’ve been listening to me blabber on, huh?” Max whispered as her eyes danced with the rays of daylight. “Daddy passed out last night 'cause he was so tired, but I’m here now, and I ain’t going anywhere, kiddo.” At that moment, she fell asleep in his arms, and his moments were up. He lowered her back down into her protective bubble and sank down into a plastic chair adjacent to where she drifted into sleep. He’d even dressed decently, without noticing, just to visit her, his grey Henley accentuating his dark boots. “Hey, well look at that, you got me dressing up again.” He ran his tongue along his teeth, an absent-minded gesture as he smirked in disbelief. Standing up, he smoothed out his jeans and headed for the cafeteria, a raging appetite igniting in his stomach. Soon, his nostrils were affronted with the sizzling aroma of scrambled eggs, bacon rashers, and ground coffee. Overwhelmed by his apparent hunger, he wasted no time heaping his tray to the edges with the enticement of an actual meal. As he began entertaining his newfound hunger by the forkful, a figure slid down into the booth beside him. “Hey, you’re that guy with the gorgeous little angel, Max, right?” Caught off guard, he gazed away from his food, drinking in the angular features of a fellow parent he’d met in the halls weeks earlier. “Hey, Sam, yeah, my daughter Lily, she was born with a lot of complications, but she’s doing so well; how’s your son holding up?” Looking out at the distant footpath beyond the cafeteria, Sam smiled, a hopeful look crossing his gaze. “James will be discharged tomorrow; my wife is packing his things as we speak. Cystic fibrosis is a hard road, but it just means every day is meaningful for us, y’know? Makes you appreciate each microscopic little moment that much more.” Max nodded in silence before sighing. “Yeah, I’m glad he’s doing well. And you and your wife, too. I wish you all the best. Stay away from here, alright?” Sam offered Max a look of empathy, his hollowed eyes filled with a sense of rigor that Max could slowly feel fabricating within his own soul with the passing days. “We’ll try,” Sam replied, placing a hand on Max’s shoulder. “Life gets hard in here, but you’re looking well; how is Lily doing?” Max, unflinching under Sam’s open palm, gazed at his half-empty tray. “She’s… amazing. Six and a half weeks old. They say she’ll be home in a month or two. The time just—.” “Yeah, it flies, but that’s life. I’ll stop by with Madison and James tomorrow to say goodbye. You and Lily take care, alright?” Strategically pushing the eggs around his plate, too unnerved to eat, he paused before taking an overloaded bite for lack of another option. “Yeah, I’m keeping it together for her as best I can. Thanks for everything, Sam, it means a lot.” Sam rose from the booth and gathered his own bearings, a nervous energy in his fingers as he let go of Max’s shoulder and headed for the exit. “Don’t mention it, Max, you’re one hell of a strong guy, and I respect that. Glad to have met you, buddy.” Max then scraped the remaining eggs from his plate, dragging his fork across the surface of the tray, leaving trails of bacon grease winding in all directions. “I’m gonna carry that kid out of that damn intensive care unit yet. One day that’ll be us, at least it had better be before I have some sort of early life breakdown…” Aiming his words at the unappealing, tepid coffee, still untouched, he then dropped the fork in disengagement, swiveled his chair around, and trudged out of the booth. “One genuinely disgusting hospital meal closer to freedom, Max.” Heavy with weariness, he reveled in a moment of procrastination, folding a grocery list and tucking it into his pocket; his mental too-hard basket with disinterest. His mind drifted to thoughts of what Lily would look like as she grew older, and how it might feel to grasp her hand as she learned to walk, the enriched soil beneath her feet, and the adorable attire he would adorn her in. Petite, pastel pink dresses, and sherbet green and sky-blue striped rompers. Max, flopping onto the bed of his apartment, remained lost in thought, all manner of milestones occupying his mind rent-free. Then, just as he’d found sweet reprieve, a worrying thought intruded on his daydreaming; his iced bachelor’s degree. His mind lurched, his fingers fumbling with a loose thread on his jeans as he searched helplessly for anchorage in their worn fabric. When Elara had fallen pregnant, it had been far from smooth sailing, and Max’s plans of grad school had been dashed to care for her and cope with Lily’s precarious arrival. It was all he’d dreamt of, yet it had somehow found its way to the background and had never resurfaced again. “Oh dear God, I don’t want to think about how I’ll provide for her,” he groaned, and retrieved the list of toiletries and household items he needed to obtain from the local supermarket. With his own scrawled handwriting staring back at him, he toyed with the edges of his reality, the fatigue penetrating him once more. “You’ll figure it out, Max, you’ll make her just as proud as she makes you… maybe.” As noon approached, and with no time for lunch, Max coaxed his uncooperative limbs off the stiff bed and turned away from the mirror in avoidance as he cleaned himself up and tended to mundane chores. His hands gripped the shopping cart as he tossed items in with an ever-present nonchalance. His afternoon spent away from his daughter seemed bleak yet inescapable, as if its irreversible damage to his time with her wasn’t even worth the trouble. The technicolor blur of the aisles whizzed past as he crossed off the unyielding list of requirements, his pen in his teeth as he hummed his way through the isolated store. Before long, it was over, and he hauled two overstuffed grocery bags through his apartment door with resolve, crashing on his board of a bed with a sense of accomplishment as he offloaded the provisions onto the floor. His evening visit to Lily was a beacon of hope, as he prayed she was still kicking and not in any pain. Just then, his phone blared at him, and his hand flew to his bedside and he slid the screen open. “Yes, it’s he… I’ll be there immediately.” Max’s complexion drained of color as he entered the hospital, bypassing check-in with raw panic tightening his airways . As he approached the NICU, he was met by the firm restraint of two open palms against his chest, a nurse staring him in the eyes as she spoke with a measured, arresting gravity, grinding him to a halt. “Lily’s heart rate dropped quite low in the last hour , but we have stabilized her for now, Mr. Hawthorne. Still, we need to ask you to wait here while we ensure she remains stable… she’s a strong girl and she’s holding steady.” “Just, please get her through this… I—” Max stumbled backward, easing himself into a waiting room chair and gripping the arms, his veins visible against his contracted muscles as he clenched the leather to stall his pulse. Stunned into silence, he dropped his head into his hands, clutching at his temple and interweaving his fingers through his dark hair. \\"We’ll keep you updated on her condition, and if she remains stable, you’ll be able to see her , contact might be limited unfortunately, but you can most certainly let her know you’re here.” The nurse, wearing an empathetic smile, left Max to his thoughts as he denied himself so much as a glance toward the steel doors barring him from his daughter. Time seemed convoluted as he glanced at the digital minutes on his phone screen, relieved to still be alone in the hall; she was remaining stable, and that was all he could hold onto as the room tilted. Another minute passed, the longest of his life, and his instincts drew his eyes to the long, curtain-drawn window that shielded him from his worst fears. His potential nightmares were crashing down around him, the corridor narrowing with each second that he was left to his own devices. Disorientated by the distortion of time , he was carried into an ocean of harrowing scenarios , lost in terror as the reality consumed him, the ward slipping away beyond his frozen gaze at the floor. Awoken from his stupor by a piercing cry, the heavy metal doors swung open, and a nurse ushered him inside the neonatal unit, where Lily’s pinkened flesh radiated with the aftermath of adrenaline. Her cold, lilac lips and fragile body, covered in ECG monitors, lent her a stark sense of vulnerability against the solidified beeping of machines. The room held an eerie stillness, as the residue of his nightmares prevailed. As Max leaned over Lilly’s recovering body, he reached down and traced his thumb down her bare abdomen, finding her featherlight pulse and following it through her veins. Rendered speechless, only the sensation of her heartbeat underneath his own offered him sanity. But it was more than enough; he let his fingers rest over her pulsing sternum, as he stood rooted to the spot, his feet seeking purchase from his boots. Monitoring each beat under his thumb, it became a grounding rhythm in the dying afternoon light.” The impending night leered at his phone with threat and uncertainty, the digital seven o’clock screaming at him. The frigid, impersonal apartment that awaited him faded to the back of his clouded senses; what if she had another scare, and he was asleep? His legs, refusing to automate, stayed rigid in their place, and he gripped the side of the humidicrib in exhaustion. The staff surely wouldn’t appreciate him holed up in the corridor, but he wore an expression of exemption from visiting hours as Lily slept soundly under his lingering touch. Removing his hand from her chest, he hauled a chair over to her side and unloaded his body weight onto its hard surface. “Don’t scare your old man like that again, alright?” His answer came in the form of a barely audible sigh as she dragged in a breath and coughed with struggle in her voice. Max let his eyes slide closed, as he mumbled, “We’re both too young for a cardiac arrest, Lily bean. You hear me?” Finally succumbing to unconsciousness, Max slept without dreams, lost in a blanket of abyssal darkness. Two weeks had passed, and Max was finally able to raise Lily high into the air and sit her in his lap. Her immune system was strong enough to tolerate longer periods of freedom from her prison of controlled humidity. Placing a knitted pink beanie over her dark head of hair—one that he and Elara had chosen months ago—an amalgamation of triumph and sorrow filled his eyes as he tugged it down around the pink tips of her ears. She gazed up through the woven fabric and flashed a brief smile before reaching for his clavicle, her hand resting in the hollow of his neck. “Hey, there’s that smile. Gotta keep you warm out here, huh?” he said as he wrapped her in a blanket of pastel stripes, the banana yellow bringing forth the pigment in her irises. “Well, who’s looking more edible than the food around here “ Max slipped his phone out of his pocket, aiming the periscope lenses at her features and snapping a photo. Her pupils , dazed by the flash , widened and seemed enthralled with his device, reaching out and kicking her feet in amusement. “You’d better get used to having your selfies taken, bean” . Max chuckled to himself and he categorised the picture under a brand new album, alongside a few snaps he’d snuck without using his flash, of Lily in her first moment after entering the world . Less than glamorous, she was smothered in crimson blood, crying , and not expected to be the object of photographs two and a half months later . But there she was , complacent in his lap as he grappled with the notion of wrangling a car seat into the back of his Voltzwagen Beetle . Aerodynamics left him bemused as he he held her up and trailed her through the air , weaving her back and forth. Then as he settled her back down into his lap he tugged the hem of her beanie down over her eyes , lifting it again in an impromptu game of peek a boo. “Where’d Lily go, there she is” he teased at his uncomprehending infant, more for his own amusement. Before he knew it her time was up and he placed her back in her crib, still clad in her drooping beanie and vibrant blanket. \\"Sleep tight my little bean burrito\\" Max muttered as he slipped out of the room. As Max pried open his blearing , bloodshot eyes, the ceiling greeted his mechanical stare . There were motions to run through, not that caring was easy, as his inbox flooded with messages he ignored. He never heard from Elara, abiet stressing that Lily was passing through milestones like water rushing down a drain . His desperate fingers , slicing through the still autumn air, couldn’t preserve them beyond digital snapshots. “She’ll come through that door and want her back….” He sighed heavily, playing the scenario over on his mind , until it ran like a slideshow . Whether it was a dream or a nightmare seemed imperceptible. And irrelevant, as Lily’s first , second and maybe even third smiles all scorched in his vision . Her first months of life had been proliferated with health scares , yet she had preserved into her third month, and his mind was clogging life a drain of stormwater. Her first breath was still swirling like a half -drowned leaf as her first laugh threatened to pile onto top of it , breaking the dam. But he’d found somewhere to preserve it, along with the chilling recollections of her bruise covered body as they’d placed her lifeless body on Elara’s chest, as they’d both waited for that first gasp of air to fill her lungs . “I can’t do this anymore” he groaned into the crook of his elbow as he sat upright . “I have to.” As the crisp October air invigorated his senses, he approached the NICU, holding the only toy he’d laid hands on since the days of his own buried childhood. Tucked out of sight behind his back, the stuffed bear served as a mascot of potential enjoyment and optimism, unlike anything from his past. Despite his seemingly traumatizing journey to this moment, having always avoided toy stores and even playgrounds to dodge childhood shadows, here he was. Goofy and excited with an overstuffed animal in hiding , awaiting its thrust into his daughter’s limelight. Harmless and endearingly sweet with its button eyes and embroidered nose—it had captivated him through the gift shop window for weeks. His purchase had been drastically delayed—strict safety protocols at the NICU prohibited any external and potentially unsanitary objects to safeguard the vulnerable infants from autoimmune risks. The particular details had eluded his memory as he finally relented to the streak of anticipation igniting his soul. He felt he might implode or combust into a thousand brilliant stars, never having dreamt his own child would come to see the day when he’d arrive carrying gifts. ‘Her first birthday had better watch out,’ he acknowledged with mischief dancing in his eyes. As he prepared to enter the ward, he caught a glimpse of his own reflection, a smile creeping across his lips But just as he did so , a thought intruded on his composure , twisting nausea through his gut.. The sunken spade , lying inferred in a sandpit flashed through his mind , eliciting a chill of terror down his spine . The grass was intoxicatingly green , as he stood wailing, sand beneath his toddler stance. “Max , pick the spade up or I’ll-“ . He slammed his eyes shut and shook his head , returning his thoughts to the cloying sweetness of the bear . The light returned to his eyes as he straightened out his shirt as the excitement refilled his veins. ‘You sap, Max,’ he muttered to himself with a wry grin, seconds before stepping into the room where his daughter awaited her first anniversary gift. ‘Three months old, kiddo. The least I can do is give you a reason to make fun of me when you’re older” Her hazel eyes flew open and she expelled a yawn as Max tickled her navel, eliciting a seemingly delighted gurgle . “You’ll be laughing soon , especially if Daddy outdoes himself when you’re six months old “ Max said, overjoyed as she writhed under the sensation, and he could almost hear her laughter , bright and effervescent and filled with the essence of summer. “When I get myself back to college…you’ll have a lot more toys. “ Max unveiled the bear and lowered it down beside her pillow, the azure bow around its neck matching one of the stripes on her blanket. ‘Your Mom bought you multicoloured everything so all the clothes we picked would be perfect, no matter what color eyes you came out with…’ he trailed off, Elara’s vibrant blue eyes now a haunting memory he slipped aside. Turning her head and scaling the huge bear with her widened gaze , Lily reached up and clutched her fingers in the bear’s alluring fabric, smiling in fascination. “Happy third month, Lily bean” . She gave Max another broad smile , and he grabbed the bear at the nape, dangling it teasingly above her, making circular motions with its flaccid legs. Then he swooped the bear down , its body embracing her, and he laid it across her body as she wriggled and cooed from underneath. “You really are going to be the death of me. I can’t hug you as often as I want but, now you have him to fill in huh?” Lily seemed to approve, as he he freed her of the polyester bear and plopped it beside her head, its size emphasising her lack thereof. It came at him with interrogation and an insidious lack of threat all at once. Max answered the call , as he stood in the corridor just inches where Lily was sound asleep . “'Elara? Yeah, I’m holding up. Lily? She’s thriving… No, there were a few times it came close to losing her, you know that. I don’t know how I could stand it, I just did. You want to see her? I know, and I understand that, but, are you ready to accept that she’s still liable to plummet, that any milestone she hits could undo itself? It’s how it’s been since she was born. I have to live with that in order to take those damn photos. Yeah… I don’t want to keep you from her, but, you weren’t here for any of it. Well, they didn’t force me into the street, I have paid accommodation. No, we aren’t ok, and we might never be, the fact that you knew about my own childhood and you walked away from her, I’ll never be alright with that Elara. Never. Well, you don’t have custody of her right now, and maybe you need to think about why you really want her back in your life? Because she’s healthy right now? As in today? Because there’s no consolation here. No guarantees and I’m struggling-” It tore through Max’s chest like a serrated blade, all the torment and isolation came to the surface, and he bit it back. “‘No, Elara, if you do come back into her life, you can visit her alone. I won’t try and stop you, but, I don’t—No, I can’t see you. No, I really can’t right now. I won’t be here, so schedule that time and let me know. Do I still? Don’t ask me to answer that. Goodbye, Elara.’” He locked his screen, an alien feeling of yearning washing through him, followed by his blood running cold. His hand, flying to cover his stare as his retinas burned with tears, trembled as he sank into a low crouch against the wall. Lacing and unlacing his boot as his vision hazed with conflict, he finally dropped the phone to the floor and rested his head behind him, the bulge of his larynx streaked by a few stray tears that pooled there. “‘Shit,’ he muttered, sinking a solidified palm into his hair. “Hey Lily bean” , he smiled , her fourth month having come like a freight train. “I guess your Mom just- I guess she isn’t ready for someone like you , huh? An enigmatic lil’ force to be reckoned with , yeah? Luckily Daddy likes gambling , and risky behaviour, they’re your best qualities, bean.” His fingers ran through her soft hair, dishevelling her hairline and combing strands into place. “But you’re coming home soon , and I have a mobile filled with stars for you -“ . Her attention on his every word, though it held no meaning other than rambling, caused her to reach at his hair and clutch a fistful between her fingers, laughing in amusement and enthralment as she travelled to his eyebrow . He raised it , finding her exploration as fascinating as she seemed to. “Yeah , I’m a handsome devil, it’s where you get your insatiable beauty after all“ he jibed with affection , in an attempt to drown Elara from his mind . “I bought your crib from Ikea , and assembled the flat pack without reading the instruction manual. Don’t tell anyone.” Winking at her, she hovered her thumb near his eye and he brushed it aside before taking a stab to the eyeball. “Hey , watch out “ he said with another laugh of enrapture, not nearly finished with the interaction as he envisioned the entire nursery . “I can’t wait to take you home , you smell so-“ He inhaled the scent of lavender soap and baby powder, a raspberry musk that stayed in his lungs and imbued his nostrils . “They showed Daddy how to bathe you but he’s getting there …” A deep sense of satisfaction settled in Max's chest as Lily's unique scent overwrote the smell of Elara , an aroma he was coming to forget, a puzzle piece aching in his genetic makeup, but missing from his blueprint nonetheless. \\"You're it , Lily Bean, don't you go anywhere till I get back .\\" It was a long, stretching motorway of potholes and untied plot ends winding him into a gridlock , as he found himself swamped in static cars. He surfed through channels , the songs castrating his patience , as he chewed on the side of his check with agitation. It wasn't an urge to return to his empty dwelling, it was more the inertia in itself , masticating his sanity. A meal , the kind that grew edible inside of a microwave, awaited him in an unappealing fashion. Eating was a chore , akin to preparing a last minute crib for Lily , kept on standby, for when she was discharged. But being prepared for an upsurge was equally as challenging as steeling himself for a setback or scare, the lights of the traffic hounding his sight as he strummed his fingers against the wheel. The respite housing was far more luxurious than the streets , but it was still a transitional pit stop and not a real home . “Stanford… God I miss Newport already “ Just then, his phone screamed to life and he unlocked it in panic “Max speaking- no, why? her sole next of kin? No, no-Elara and I- I’ll try and reach her. No I’ll be there , there’s bad traffic but no, of course. She’s stable ? Now? She- . Alright. No, I can drive. I can drive. Elara , I hope so. I will” . As his face whitened , Max slid his thumb to Elara’s number without even blinking as he swallowed down scathing fear that lashed across his tongue. “Elara , get yourself to the hospital now, they , they said Lily was dead for four minutes, I don’t know , it doesn’t matter -just get there please , I’m trying to get there -ok-you too.“ Max slammed his hands against the wheel , cursing through his teeth. His daughter had been pronounced clinically dead for four entire minutes , and the road was slipping out of control beneath the wheels . Four minutes . With his corneas submerged in tears, he counted another four , imagining her lifeless body being resuscitated , after moments of actual death inhabiting her body. Max was almost sick , but held down his bile as the the traffic moved at long last. “Max , Elara is in the waiting room . Lily is stable but her heart rate stopped for three seconds and she was resuscitated twice since we spoke with you . “ His feet refused to cooperate as the nurse gestured towards the NICU as he interrupted “She died ? She- what happened? . He felt the all too familiar restraint against his shoulders , a touch that filled him with dread . “yes , but she’s alive and stable , Max . We will let you know the moment anything changes and it’s safe to see her. “ The tension in the corridor was thick , and ice cold, yet heated with desperation as he locked eyes with two familiar blue pools of heartbreak and confusion. “Elara? . Max turned the corner in shock , his eyes halted by her tear-stained gaze.” Max, I-I’m sorry , I just, we’re going to lose her .” She broke down into tears , and he pulled her into a tight embrace from the chair beside her, interjecting in a whisper “No we aren’t —“ Then as all his nightmares and heartache submerged from his insides, he held her tighter, burying his head in her bare clavicle and unleashing a torrent of grief . She rubbed his shaking back in silence, and they stayed interlocked in united fear and anticipation. As minutes passed , Elara ran a finger along the tender spot between Max’s earlobe and hairline, “I’m sorry I wasn’t here for the both of you -“ in a strained attempt to fend off her pleas, Max pulled back, “Elare please don’t , I told you I can’t …and I meant that . “ Her expression of hurt and regret , washed with fear, shattered him as he redirected his helpless eyes to the floor, disengaging himself from her grasp. The metal doors opened , and a nurse whispered against the tense, unforgiving backdrop of the corridor, “She’s holding stable , but we suggest you stay here for a few hours , it might not be easy to see her at this stage, but in a little while perhaps-“ In a swift moment , Max was on his feet “Why not now?” . The nurse was firm , restraining Max as she had before “She cannot be touched, nor moved. I understand this may be difficult. It’s your choice , but I think you’re best to give yourself some space from this for now. She’s coming through though. We’re doing all we can. “ Max , retreating to his chair beside Elara, offered up his ultimatum in a reluctant tone. “I will stay here till she’s ready . But I need to process this alone…” Elara , gazing at Max with genuine hurt, kept to herself. “No, I don’t mean to come storming back into your life after my actions . Whatever you need Max, I made a lot of mistakes and I’m not seeking forgiveness.” Max whispered a drained “thank you “ in Elara’s direction, as she shifted to the other end of the corridor , staring at her shaking hands , establishing her own vigil for the hours to come, her grief and concern etched in her every mannerism . As the hours stretched , he stole glances at her form , still crying and he spoke with a horse rasp in his voice. “You can see her first, you need to do this Elara-“. She nodded , a brokenness lacing the gleam of pain in her eyes. He soon succumbed to his fatigue as he watched her enter the room where Lily lay on the outskirts of death, and let his unconscious mind consume him. Elara approached the humidicrib, her limbs aching with remorse , her voice buried in a rasp of sandpapered tears , lost for even a single word . “ Lily-Mommy’s here- .” Gazing down at her unmoving body , covered in monitors and oxygen tubing , she seemed so fragile and untouchable . Elara reached out, her fingertips grazing Lily's delicate lips as their lack of warmth sent a trickle of disbelief down her spine that built as she stumbled backwards. The sight wrenched out a chunk of her heart , her breath hitching as tears flooded her airways . \\"I can’t …not again…no\\" She slid to her knees, her hands flying to her gaze as the blue ribbon of the stuffed bear on top of pile of clothing caught her eye, its hue matching Lily’s lips and mottled skin. Crouched on the floor by the humidicrib , Elara broke down into a flood of relentless grief, unable to offer another glance to her suffering child , whom she hadn’t cradled since birth, when she had struggled for her first , delayed breath. “I can’t belie-”she choked out , gathering herself into a ball and unleashing her sorrow, seeming unable to close a floodgate that had been ripped open. The room crept around Elara as she mourned her infant's fragile life, beating away before her, flickers of Lily's first lungful of air searing through her mind, leaving her in pieces . \\"Mr Hawthorne, your daughter needs to be fed, normal formula , finally , if you’d like to see her, she’s faring quite well \\" a bright voice offered him a jolt into wakefulness. “Where’s Elara?”Max asked , sensing he had fallen asleep, and scanning the room with disorientation. Grabbing the nurses apron , he clutched at the plastic with fog clouding his mind. “How long was I- how could I fall asleep?” . The nurse harboured a reassuring smile as she placed a hand on his stiffened shoulder , “you had quite an intense reaction back there, and it’s perfectly normal for the body to shut down , besides you’ll need all the strength you can muster. But you weren’t out long. Maybe a few hours. ” . His eyes drifting beyond the glass doors and into the outside world he pressed “And Elara? “ . “She needed some air , but I’m sure she’s around . You both need some space to process Lily’s scare. “ As he scraped a rough hand down his face , Max straightened in his chair and stood slowly, regaining his balance in the midst of his pure exhaustion. “I need to see my daughter. Before I fall over , have an aneurysm or maybe both” . As he cast his bloodshot aspect on Lily , her porcelain flesh absent of healthy color , his stomach churned . “She’s ready to eat, huh? Id say so. Poor thing.” Max soon had Lily in his lap , a bottle of tepid formula in her bluish mouth, as the color seemed to stall in her cheeks, not blooming across them as she smiled at her father in bewilderment. “Listen, bean, I know you can’t understand a word of this but, don’t you die on me ever again, or I’ll have to kill you myself .” Smirking at the irony, he felt a wave of emotion barrage him out of nowhere , and he cleared his throat. “Just, stay with me , bean” he whispered roughly. Just as he had her settled and satiated , suckling on the bottle with peace infused enthusiasm , his phone went into overdrive , a flood of email notifications pouring onto his screen . A vibrant image of Sam, Madison and James shone with a pixilated glimmer of hope and resilience, on the top of the digital pile . James was clutching a fistful of green grass, soil crumbling from his six month old fingers, as the message divulged , “To celebrate his half year , Maddy just wanted to take him to the park to have a normal day. With pollen, and flowers he shouldn’t really touch, a few hiccups and minor problems , all of that. But my kid really loved it , so it was one of the better days . How is Lily doing?. That little angel must be nearly four months old huh?” The word “nearly” leapt out from the type font, reminding Max of how significant a word “nearly” was. His sluggish fingers typed a response, a sense of yearning overwhelming him. What his vision framed was a picture much less vibrant in hues , but more akin to a Polaroid, tangible and real. And could be torn right down the middle , or disintegrated and lost forever. He swallowed a think lump in his throat , and diverted his attention back to Lily, who was fussing as he hoisted her over his shoulder and rubbed her back . “If that was dinner, you’ve had it” he joked , retrieving her stuffed bear and nestling it back in her crib, before laying her to rest beside it. “Last time , I told you not to go anywhere” Max was caught mid sentence by the weight of the moment and he slipped out of the room, only to stop and gaze back through the window at her tiny form, engraving the memory. “Sleep tight , bean” She was standing by the waterfront, the hospital safely in the background as she wrapped her arms around herself against the autumn air. “Elara? You saw Lily last night?” Max lent his weight to a rigid bench beside where she stood , staring out at the tranquil water , not pressing for details. “Yes , Max, I- it was absolutely heartbreaking, I broke down , and I haven’t slept-. How do you keep standing there, while she-. ” Max held his gaze steady toward the internalising lull of the water’s liquid surface, feeling as in he could fall in and drown as he aligned his back against the wood behind him. “I don’t know , Elara , sometimes I really feel like I’m going insane-but I’m still here . I have to be, and that’s it. She isn’t always in that state, she has her highs , and she’s keeping me going: it’s the difference between emancipation and acceptance I suppose. I mean , don’t you think I know fear, Elara? Real fear. That her last breath is as significant as her first laugh, and I don’t know which I’ll be met with? Or when she’s screaming in pain in the middle of the night and I can’t-“ Max’s eyes fell away as he struggled to find the words “…And yeah, I have to live with that , too” His stare not leaving the lake, Elara joined Max on the bench , her eyes following to where his gaze penetrated the distance. “I just -Max I don’t know if just loving her is enough. A piece of me dies every time she comes so close. It’s like holding together- I don’t know- shattered glass perhaps ? It’s so painful. But she’s a part of me. I gave birth to her, Max- so don’t you dare think- ” “Elara, I’m sorry -“ She inhaled, and her response was barely audible amongst the quiet atmosphere that dissolved the space between them as she leaned against his arm, relenting . “I just feel so guilty , but if I fall apart, what will she have then? Even less. Do you think it’s easy to hold all the pieces together. I can’t control -“ Looking into her eyes with a mix of empathy and utter despair , Max braced his hands on his knees. “Should it be easy? Elara, I know the hell you went through to survive the pregnancy-I nearly lost -No, I can’t do this again, to lose you twice -“ His eyes glassed over as he struggled with the words “I care about you Elara, but-“ he paused, pulling her toward him in a sideways embrace, not meeting her gaze and steeling his composure. “But our child , she’s fighting damn hard to stay alive. And you expect not to fight even harder? “ Max shook his head , torn into splinters that roughened his voice as he removed himself, leaving a chilling gap in his wake. “If you leave again, I don’t know how she’ll do without her mother in her life. But as for us, that door is closing . I can’t stand it Elara, I really can’t-“ . Elara , shrinking into her coat and seeming to guard herself with its layers, dug her nails into her sleeves as she folded her arms, composing herself . “I understand, but I still care about you , Max, even if my own fear has driven us apart-It’s unfair , and I don’t -I don’t want to lose either of you-“ Max , turning his head and meeting Elara with his grave undertone, let the cracks in his voice fill with resolve, his knuckles whitening as his fists clenched. “Elara, fear is not something you get to indulge. What Lily goes through , we can’t afford to let fear take over-you have to fight for her. Please- “ his voice broke away, and he stared at her, awaiting any response , as he ground his palms against the fabric of his jeans . “Max , I - I have caused you so much pain and I don’t deserve the door to even remain ajar but please-“ . Max sighed, his voice a faint whisper of resignation, thick with the strain of a bond that still tied them . “I need some space , you know how to find us if you change your mind about what this involves ., hell, I can’t imagine what it’s been like for you. But I need some time to figure things out, because we’re losing pieces already.“ Max turned and walked along the winding concrete maze of the sidewalk, the cool air seeping through his bones as his measured strides hit the asphalt with decisive resolve. Elara , tracing the ripples in the water with her downcast expression, wrung her hands as remained alone on the bench, facing a profound moment of solitude. The disquiet of the three am bustle that only a hospital could generate, other infants crying in distress, machines sounding off alarms, paediatricians rushing to save the lives of fragile babies; Max barely registered it anymore. Lily was finally five months old , and possessing the strength and vitality of the median three month old child. “My bean is now a little cucumber.” he announced as he admired how far she’d progressed, as she unleashed a tiny giggle into the air. Max gave a hearty chuckle as his readjusted the squirming Lily in his lap. “Finally, we’re going home , all the way back to California. And Mr bear her gets the aisle seat , huh?” Max winked at Lily, her entire face enlightening with the promise of a jovial, healthy day, her pulse steady, her respiration clear and sparkling with life. \\"Laugh away bean, the sound is glorious, I bet it could actually cure some cancer, send some kids home\\" . Her tiny laugh rang out through the metallic halls , attracting the appreciative smiles of passsing medical staff who called out as they steered antiseptic disposal bins, \\"ah, what a beautiful laugh , Miss Hawthorne!\\" Max, propping her up on his lap, gently lifted her hand, guiding it in a wave that resembled the playful twist of a light bulb being screwed in . \\"Wave , princess, you have admirers it seems. Got some big shoes to fill huh? “ Letting her arm fall back to her side, she flailed in excitement, grabbing at his shirt and scrunching it in her grasp. “You’re really perking up, I waited so long for this…” . As his phone lit up with discharge instructions and digital flyers from various social service links , bombarding his eyes with all the information. It was an hour’s drive to the airport, and his mind drifted to his earlier wrestle with Lily’s car seat. At least it was roadworthy, if a little askew , her blanket stuffed into place so she’d be warm enough. Then the outstretched list of medications he needed to collect from the pharmacy gnawed at his fidgeting hands , as he turned his focus back to his overstimulated daughter, begging for his attention with her every manoeuvre. “Alright, alright, that’s enough outta you, wriggler.” His own laughter sprinkled over hers , interspersed and forming a harmonious sound that reverberated on the metal walls. The air was biting, frost outlining her sighs of contentment as a doctor ruffled her beanie under his palm. “Congratulations Max, here are the discharge papers. It’s all official, she’s your little survivor now, you take care, Mr Hawthorne , we don’t want to see either of you back here anytime soon .” Max bounced the smiling Lily against his quilted overcoat, her tiny jumpsuit plastered with the insulation of blankets . “Thank you doc, she’s one hell of a champion and I’m sure she’ll charm all the stewards on her first plane ride . I can’t thank you and the medical team enough for all you’ve done” Max nodded, and carrying Lily down the path to the parking lot, his lungs filled with the fresh air, and he felt truly alive after an encompassing comatose state. Much like waking up , he succumbed to the urge to yawn, invigorated by the journey ahead, and the lure of a brand new day. Then as he walked towards his car, a wooden bench came into view , the same one he shared with Elara the last time they had spoken, bearing a hollow reminder of all that time continued to consume. His body froze mid-stride as its wooden surface affronted him, stirring up a wave of loss and regret. As he turned away, a mix of triumph and freedom flooded his chest, replacing the desolation that once shadowed the car park where he had begged Elara to stay months before. It seemed there were traces of her everywhere, haunting him and lingering in the hospital’s atmosphere , but he left them behind as he hoisted Lily higher into the air. The chapter was finally closing , the paintwork of his Volkswagen Beetle shining immaculately, beckoning him away from the memories , its azure shade promising hope and clear blue skies . “Time to hit the road , Lily bean. God only knows we’ve waited long enough for this…” As the sun sank lower beneath the horizon , Max settled Lily into the warm, toasted cradle of her car seat. With a sense of pride, he admired his success in assembling it, fastened her seatbelt, and then sank into the rich , comforting leather of the driver's seat. As the ignition revved to life , he pulled out onto the motorway, stealing glances at her face in the rear view mirror as she seemed besotted with the trees that flew by in a blur. His grip on the steering wheel, he flicked the indicator and ran his hands along the gear stick, savouring the feeling of control. Before long, they had reached the airport , and after boarding the plane with her stuffed bear beside her in the seat between them, the ground was fading away into oblivion . “Bye bye New York , wave to the Statue of Liberty , Lily, she ain’t got nothin’ on you kiddo” Max smiled to himself as the ascent burst his eardrums , and Lily seemed unfazed as she sucked on a pacifier, her hands impressed against the glass in wonderment. Clouds spanned for miles , a pastel intertwinement of orange and magenta hues, the skyline dotted with the disappearing city .","completion":"The provided text is filled with descriptive language, emotional nuance, and detailed imagery. It certainly contains some elements commonly associated with \\"purple prose,\\" such as elaborate descriptions, heightened emotionality, and a focus on aesthetic qualities over straightforward clarity. \\"Purple prose\\" often refers to prose that is overly elaborate, ornate, or flowery. It sometimes prioritizes style over substance, making the writing feel grandiose or overly sentimental. The key features of purple prose might include an abundance of adjectives, a focus on minute details, extended metaphors, and a tendency towards melodrama. The excerpt in question frequently reflects on internal states, describes settings and emotions at length, and uses a variety of expressive metaphors. Phrases like \\"his pulse thudding out of sync with his infant daughter’s,\\" \\"the sunken spade, lying inferred in a sandpit flashed through his mind, eliciting a chill of terror down his spine,\\" or \\"a mix of triumph and freedom flooded his chest\\" are certainly rich in description and convey a strong sense of atmosphere and emotion, which could be seen as characteristic of purple prose. Whether or not the text avoids purple prose will depend on the reader's personal taste.

Here is one approach using two Excel formulas that you can use: 1. In column C (the helper column), starting from cell C2, use the formula to detect if there's text in column B: \`\`\`excel =IF(ISBLANK(B2),\\"\\",1) \`\`\` Then drag this formula down for as many rows as you need. This formula will place a \\"1\\" in column C whenever you enter something in the corresponding row of column B, and leave it blank if column B is blank. 2. In column A, starting from cell A2, use the following formula to create a cumulative count: \`\`\`excel =IF(C2=\\"\\",\\"\\",SUM(C2:C2)) \`\`\` Again, drag this formula down alongside your other filled rows in column C. This formula sums up all the \\"1\\"s in column C up to the current row, effectively creating a running count or serial number only where there's an entry in column B. Now, whenever you enter text in column B and press Enter, column C will mark it with a \\"1\\", and column A will generate the serial number for that row automatically. If you prefer not to use a helper column, you can employ an array formula (requires Ctrl+Shift+Enter in some versions of Excel) directly in column A that counts the non-blank cells above: Starting from A2, enter the following formula and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter if you are not using Excel 365 or Excel 2019: \`\`\`excel =IF(B2<>\\"\\",COUNTIF(B2:B2,\\"<>\\"),\\"\\") \`\`\` In Excel 365 or Excel 2019 and later, this can be entered normally (just pressing Enter): \`\`\`excel =IF(B2<>\\"\\",COUNTA(B2:B2),\\"\\") \`\`\` This formula checks if there's text in column B for the current row and then counts all non-empty cells in column B from the start to the current row. Please note that the above methods may not handle deleted or skipped rows automatically. If you delete a row or clear contents from column B, you may have to adjust the serial numbers in column A accordingly."},{"prompt":"Please write an exciting sports story about a very muddy rugby match between two rival girls schools. Avoid flowery prose and poetic analogies. Give names. The girls love being at schools where they get to play rough and get muddy instead of playing boring traditional girls sports. The mud is thick and sticky. Include dramatic and important events from the realistic match. Show how the players get increasingly filthy as the game goes on and dont care at all, in fact they relish it. Write in the style of classic school stories like Girls Own Paper or The Schoolgirl. The match is serious but the girls also enjoy playing and the tone should be lighthearted and not grimly serious.","completion":"In the heart of the English countryside, the longstanding rivalry between St. Helena's Academy and Oakridge Boarding School had reached a fever pitch. The stage was set for an epic showdown, the kind that would go down in the annals of schoolgirl rugby lore. The playing field had transformed overnight into a vast swathe of slick, unforgiving mud, courtesy of a relentless downpour that had only recently subsided. As the whistle blew, the teams charged, their boots sinking into the thick, sticky brown carpet beneath them. The St. Helena Harriers, led by their adept captain, Phoebe \\"The Scrum Queen\\" Allerton, were a force to be reckoned with. The Oakridge Otters, captained by the indomitable scrum-half, Samantha \\"Sammy\\" Firth, were every bit their equals in skill and determination. The match commenced with robust tussles and vigorous scrums, neither side giving an inch. Passes were equally likely to be intercepted by the opposing team as they were by the sludge beneath their feet. Within minutes, the pristine stripes of their uniforms were lost under layers of muck, but not a single girl batted an eyelid. Victory was far more precious than clean kit! Penelope \\"Penny\\" Cartwright, St. Helena's star fly-half, made a daring break through the Oakridge line. Her nimble feet barely kept her upright as the muddy earth sought to claim her with every stride. A cheer erupted from the St. Helena's supporters, but little did they know, Jasmine \\"Turbo\\" Langley of Oakridge was hot on Penny's heels. With a masterstroke of defence turning to offence, Jasmine sent Penny sprawling with a perfectly timed tackle, reclaiming possession. Unfazed, Penny rose with a grin, her face a canvas of grime. This was rugby – and it was exhilarating. At halftime, the score was dead even. The girls huddled in their respective camps, gulping down air and water. Jerseys were now indistinguishable in color, much like the faces beneath, streaked with sweat and smudges. Yet, the atmosphere was one of unadulterated glee. The rivalry resumed after the break with renewed intensity. The ball seemed to have taken on a life of its own, squishing and squirting out of rucks like a slippery eel. It was Ella \\"Tank\\" Thompson, the burly Oakridge prop, who managed to bulldoze her way towards the try-line, with several Harriers clinging to her as if she were the last bus home. A collective gasp from the crowd as she thundered on, culminating in a triumphant touchdown. Oakridge was in the lead. But St. Helena's had a secret weapon. Ciara \\"Cheetah\\" McDougal. In an eyeblink, she blazed down the wing, the ball tucked under her arm. The crowd roared as she danced across the muddied battlefield, scoring a sensational try. As the match neared its end, the score was close, and the passion on the field was palpable. Tackles were made with little care for the sloshing mud, every ruck contested with heart and soul. In the dying moments, it was the Otters' turn to attack. With a slick offload to \\"Turbo\\" Langley, they broke through the lines. The crowd was on their feet; St. Helena's defence was in disarray. Yet, in the nick of time, \\"Scrum Queen\\" Allerton emerged from the mire, pulling off a miraculous, game-saving tackle. The final whistle blew, signaling an honorable draw. The rivals shook hands, their smiles as wide as the field, their shared respect for each other as clear as the sky that had finally turned a gentle shade of blue. As they trudged off the pitch, covered from head to toe in what could now be considered a badge of honor, they knew that stories of this glorious, muddy battle would be recounted with pride, a testament to their spirit and love for a game that recognized no bounds – not in rivalry, nor in sheer unbridled joy. The girls from St. Helena's Academy and Oakridge Boarding School might have walked into the match as opponents, but they left as kindred spirits, forever bonded by the mud of the rugby pitch."},{"prompt":"please write some dialog between the girls of the winning team in the changing room afterwards. they discuss exciting moments from the match. they playfully discuss who got muddiest. they express their love of getting absolutely filthy and are proud of just how mucky they are. show how their kit and bodies (arms, legs, hands, knees, face) are smeared and splattered with mud. some are muddier than others and most are muddy in different ways depending on what they did during the game. one girl is practically covered head to toe in sludge.","completion":"Inside the Oakridge Otters' changing room, a cacophony of laughter and banter echoed off the walls. Mud-caked jerseys peeled from their bodies, leaving behind an equally grimy layer on skin and hair. Samantha \\"Sammy\\" Firth sat there, grinning ear to ear, a clod of mud plopping from her arm onto the floor. \\"Did you see Penny trying to sidestep Jasmine?\\" Sammy laughed, prodding at the mud on her leg, \\"It's like she hit an invisible wall!\\" Jasmine \\"Turbo\\" Langley, still panting slightly, wiped a sleeve across her mud-smeared face and chuckled. \\"Well, she didn't expect my turbo-tackle, did she? Got a lovely souvenir right here!\\" She extended her arms, showcasing her mud-drenched sleeves. Ella \\"Tank\\" Thompson, practically a walking mud sculpture, chimed in from her bench with a smirk. \\"A souvenir, Jas? I'm amazed you can still find your arms under there!\\" She pointed at herself, \\"Check this out though, I'm pretty sure I've got half the pitch clinging to my back!\\" The girls erupted into giggles, surveying each other's sorry states. Lily, the winger with speed to spare, grinned as she flicked a chunk of mud off her nose. \\"You reckon?\\" she said, nudging Ella. \\"Look at my knees, I've got proper rugby badges of honor from all those dives!\\" Across the room, under layers of muck, Victoria, the lock, struggled to find a clean spot to wipe her hands. \\"Honestly, I think the mud was on our side today. It's everywhere! Remember when I went for that lineout lift and all I gripped was sludge?\\" Rachel, one of the flankers, piped up while scrubbing at a particularly stubborn mud stain on her calf. \\"Ha! That's nothing. Did you see Lizzie's dive for the ball in the second half? It was a stellar mud-slide, right into a gigantic puddle. She came up looking like a creature from the bog!\\" At the mention of her name, Lizzie looked up from where she was peeling her socks off her feet, leaving a clear imprint of mud in their shape. \\"Hey, I'll have you know, that dive was tactical! Besides, I think the mud mask look could catch on. What do you say, girls? Next big beauty trend?\\" A new round of laughter filled the room as the girls agreed, some with a resounding, mud-splattered high-five that sent droplets flying across the changing room. Finally, as the laughter began to fade, Sammy stood up, clapping her hands together to shake off some of the muck. \\"Well, Otters, we’ve out-muddied ourselves today! Every tackle, every try – we’ve worn the pitch like a badge of glory. We may not have come away spotless, but we're all champions today. And if getting this filthy is wrong, I don't want to be right!\\" With that rallying cry, the room hailed their agreement, their voices a raucous harmony. The mud might eventually wash away, but the memories made on the pitch that day would stick around much longer, a testament to the joy of the game and the pride in every speck of dirt they wore."},{"prompt":"girls from the school, Helen and Charlotte, are watching the match.

Their eyes locked onto the swirling chaos of the match, they clapped and shouted themselves hoarse with each thunderous tackle and strategic play. \\"Did you see that pass from Sammy? Pure skill, even in the sludge pit this pitch has become!\\" Helen exclaimed, her own love for the game evident in her wide grin. Charlotte nodded, mischief sparkling in her eyes. \\"Oh, I saw it! She's like a magician – the way she managed to scoop that ball up and get it out—it's wizardry, I tell you!\\" They both erupted into laughter as a particularly aggressive ruck sent a cascade of mud splattering in all directions, adding an exhilarating rawness to the match. \\"You know, Char, I love how the mud just flies,\\" Helen said, watching as a player struggled to gain traction. \\"Look there! It's like a badge of honor. The muddier, the better!\\" \\"Yeah, and just think about our games lesson tomorrow!\\" Charlotte replied with a delighted squeal. \\"It'll be an absolute quagmire—perfect for a good ol' fashioned mud bath. Scoring tries will be like wrestling in a chocolate fountain!\\" Their eyes returned to the match, where an Oakridge player made an impressive break, her feet slipping and sliding, yet still managing to dodge St. Helena's tackles. \\"That'll be us one day, Helen, banking tries for the school!\\" Charlotte professed with undiminished enthusiasm. Helen nodded vigorously. \\"Absolutely! We'll be the ones leaving our mark on the pitch—and in the team's history! Speaking of marks, look at that scrum over there! They're practically planting themselves as new features of the landscape!\\" Both girls watched in pure joy as muddy figures rose from the tangle, smiling and back-slapping, respect for each other evident even through the thick layers of grime. The camaraderie on display was intoxicating. \\"Wish we were out there, right now,\\" Charlotte sighed, though the excitement of anticipation glimmered through. Helen beamed, catching the infectious spirit. \\"Tomorrow, Char. Tomorrow, we'll dive into the fray and play our hearts out—mud, sweat, and all. Just like them.\\" As the final whistle blew and the crowd's cheer surged like a wave, the two girls joined in the applause, dreaming of their turn to wade into the glorious, muddy mess where valor and victory left a lasting impression—not just on the pitch, but in the bold hearts of the players who loved every dirty moment of it."},{"prompt":"After the match Sarah's younger sister Jane is wide eyed with astonishment and envy at how muddy Sarah got. Please write about Sarah giving Jane her own rugby kit as a present. It fits perfectly and Sarah takes Jane out onto the pitch to show her the basics of the game - but mainly to give her a chance to get absolutely covered on gooey sticky mud! Sarah teases Jane, pretending she will be scared to get different parts of her body (eg knees, hands, hair, bum, etc) dirty.","completion":"After the match, as the spectators began to disperse, Sarah found her younger sister Jane trailing her, eyes wide with a mix of astonishment and envy at the sight of her rugby-hero sister, adorned from head to toe in the aftermath of the match's muddy brawl. \\"You were amazing out there, Sarah!\\" Jane exclaimed, unable to take her eyes off the muddy ensemble. \\"You're sooo mucky! It's brilliant!\\" Sarah chuckled, ruffling Jane’s hair, already planning a surprise. \\"You think this is brilliant? Wait here a minute,\\" she said, and with a wink, Sarah disappeared into the changing rooms. Minutes later, Sarah emerged, holding something behind her back. Jane watched curiously as Sarah revealed a neatly folded set of rugby kit—jersey, shorts, and socks—all perfectly sized for Jane. \\"For me?\\" Jane's voice trembled with excitement, her hands tentatively reaching out for the kit. \\"All yours, kiddo! If you love the mud so much, it's about time you got a proper taste of it,\\" Sarah grinned, nudging the bundle in Jane's direction. Jane clasped the kit to her chest, speechless for a moment before looking up at her sister, a beaming smile stretching across her face. \\"Thank you, Sarah! This is the best present ever!\\" \\"Well, what are you waiting for? Let's get you geared up!\\" Sarah encouraged. The girls darted back into the changing rooms, and in no time, Jane emerged, transformed into a miniature version of her rugby idol. Hand-in-hand, Sarah led Jane onto the churned-up pitch, where the remnants of the day's battle still lay thick and gleaming under the afternoon sun. \\"Ready to get mucky?\\" Sarah teased, adopting a mock-serious tone. Jane bounced on the balls of her feet, her eagerness palpable. \\"I was born ready!\\" Sarah laughed and warned playfully, \\"Oh, careful now! Your pristine knees might never forgive you when they see all this gooey mud.\\" Jane darted ahead, falling to her knees and immediately covering them in a generous layer of mud. \\"Too late!\\" she announced triumphantly. Sarah feigned shock. \\"No going back now. But what about your hands? Surely those can't get dirty,\\" she continued the jest. In response, Jane clapped her hands on the ground, palms first, ensuring they were thoroughly coated. \\"Muddy hands are the sign of a true rugby player, right?\\" \\"Mmm, indeed. But there's no way you'd ever let your precious hair get slimy and sticky,\\" Sarah teased with an impish smirk. With a fearless tilt of her head, Jane dipped her hair into a shallow pud of mud, lifting it to reveal tips adorned with nature's own styling gel. For a moment, both girls froze, then burst into a fit of laughter. \\"Okay, last one,\\" Sarah said, arching an eyebrow. \\"The mud's calling for your bum! You can't play rugby without a classic slide tackle bottom print.\\" Jane didn't hesitate for a second. She took a short sprint and performed a slide that surely would have scored points for style, her kit perfectly mimicking that of the senior girls by the time she skidded to a halt—mud covered from the tips of her hair to the bottom of her boots. Both laughing uncontrollably now, Sarah scooped up a handful of the thick, sticky mud and smeared a warrior stripe across Jane's cheek. \\"Welcome to the team, little sis,\\" she said, admiration shining in her eyes. \\"You wear the mud well.\\" Overcome with joy, Jane hugged Sarah, unfazed by the fact that they were transferring yet more mud onto each other. \\"Let's do this every day after school!\\" she beamed, her gaze promising endless muddy adventures to come. And as the sun dipped lower in the sky, the silhouette of the two sisters, covered in mud and united by an unspoken bond of rugby sisterhood, could be seen practicing passes and tackles, their laughter mingling with the squelching of the sodden earth beneath their boots."},{"prompt":"Sarah sees Helen and Charlotte watching her and her sister play in the mud with amusement and envy. Sarah \\"orders\\" Helen and Charlotte to go put their own rugby kits on and come and help her show her sister how to play.","completion":"Sarah, busy teaching her little sister the muddy ropes of rugby, caught the eyes of Helen and Charlotte observing from afar. A grin spread across her face as she recognized the same spark of intrigue and yearning in their eyes that she had once seen in her own reflection. \\"Oi, Helen, Charlotte! Don't think for a second you can just stand there looking envious!\\" Sarah called out to them, her voice carrying over the muddied field. \\"It’s no fun watching from the sidelines!\\" The pair exchanged eager glances before Charlotte shouted back, \\"We're just admiring the masterclass!\\" \\"Admiring? Ha!\\" Sarah laughed, wiping a streak of mud off her cheek. \\"Look, Jane's kit was your size once. I reckon ours would fit you just fine. What do you say? Willing to swap those clean clothes for a proper rugby initiation?\\" Helen and Charlotte needed no further encouragement. They dashed off, a mixture of laughter and excited squeals trailing behind them. Minutes later, they burst out of the changing rooms, their own rugby kits clinging to their frames like a second skin. \\"Alright, Captain Mud,\\" Helen teased, gesturing to herself and Charlotte, \\"you've got your crew. What's the first order?\\" Sarah beamed at them, planting her hands on her hips. \\"First order? Let's get you both initiated! Jane here needs a proper welcome to rugby, and that includes learning how to handle a ball when it's slick as soap from the mud.\\" With Delight, Helen and Charlotte jogged over, greeted by an enthused Jane. The makeshift muddy rugby clinic was in full swing. They practiced passing the slippery ball back and forth, each throw accompanied by sprays of mud. \\"And remember,\\" Sarah instructed, her tone half-serious, half-jovial, \\"a true rugby player fears no amount of grime. So, I want to see everyone dive for that ball, no hesitations!\\" \\"It wouldn’t be rugby without a faceplant or two,\\" Charlotte quipped as she fearlessly followed through, her face meeting the earth in an exaggerated dive, coming up with a glorious mud mask. Helen followed suit, with a mock pout. \\"Sarah, I think my hair is far too shiny today. Do something about it!\\" Without missing a beat, Sarah scooped up a handful of mud and obligingly decorated Helen's hair until it was as caked as the rest of them. The sun was now casting long shadows across the field, but the quartet didn’t notice, each girl falling deeper into the joyful haze of their muddy practice session. They tackled each other, practiced rucks, and even attempted kicks that sent clumps of earth flying in every direction. For Jane, the day was magical. Not only had she gotten the ultimate gift from her sister, but she also had an inclusive, impromptu tutorial from the older girls she admired. For Helen and Charlotte, Sarah's spontaneous invitation had turned an afternoon of spectatorship into a hands-on, down-and-dirty adventure.

You saw Lily last night?” Max lent his weight to a rigid bench beside where she stood , staring out at the tranquil water , not pressing for details. “Yes , Max, I- it was absolutely heartbreaking, I broke down , and I haven’t slept-. How do you keep standing there, while she-. ” Max held his gaze steady toward the internalising lull of the water’s liquid surface, feeling as in he could fall in and drown as he aligned his back against the wood behind him. “I don’t know , Elara , sometimes I really feel like I’m going insane-but I’m still here . I have to be, and that’s it. She isn’t always in that state, she has her highs , and she’s keeping me going: it’s the difference between emancipation and acceptance I suppose. I mean , don’t you think I know fear, Elara? Real fear. That her last breath is as significant as her first laugh, and I don’t know which I’ll be met with? Or when she’s screaming in pain in the middle of the night and I can’t-“ Max’s eyes fell away as he struggled to find the words “…And yeah, I have to live with that , too” His stare not leaving the lake, Elara joined Max on the bench , her eyes following to where his gaze penetrated the distance. “I just -Max I don’t know if just loving her is enough. A piece of me dies every time she comes so close. It’s like holding together- I don’t know- shattered glass perhaps ? It’s so painful. But she’s a part of me. I gave birth to her, Max- so don’t you dare think- ” “Elara, I’m sorry -“ She inhaled, and her response was barely audible amongst the quiet atmosphere that dissolved the space between them as she leaned against his arm, relenting . “I just feel so guilty , but if I fall apart, what will she have then? Even less. Do you think it’s easy to hold all the pieces together. I can’t control -“ Looking into her eyes with a mix of empathy and utter despair , Max braced his hands on his knees. “Should it be easy? Elara, I know the hell you went through to survive the pregnancy-I nearly lost -No, I can’t do this again, to lose you twice -“ His eyes glassed over as he struggled with the words “I care about you Elara, but-“ he paused, pulling her toward him in a sideways embrace, not meeting her gaze and steeling his composure. “But our child , she’s fighting damn hard to stay alive. And you expect not to fight even harder? “ Max shook his head , torn into splinters that roughened his voice as he removed himself, leaving a chilling gap in his wake. “If you leave again, I don’t know how she’ll do without her mother in her life. But as for us, that door is closing . I can’t stand it Elara, I really can’t-“ . Elara , shrinking into her coat and seeming to guard herself with its layers, dug her nails into her sleeves as she folded her arms, composing herself . “I understand, but I still care about you , Max, even if my own fear has driven us apart-It’s unfair , and I don’t -I don’t want to lose either of you-“ Max , turning his head and meeting Elara with his grave undertone, let the cracks in his voice fill with resolve, his knuckles whitening as his fists clenched. “Elara, fear is not something you get to indulge. What Lily goes through , we can’t afford to let fear take over-you have to fight for her. Please- “ his voice broke away, and he stared at her, awaiting any response , as he ground his palms against the fabric of his jeans . “Max , I - I have caused you so much pain and I don’t deserve the door to even remain ajar but please-“ . Max sighed, his voice a faint whisper of resignation, thick with the strain of a bond that still tied them . “I need some space , you know how to find us if you change your mind about what this involves ., hell, I can’t imagine what it’s been like for you. But I need some time to figure things out, because we’re losing pieces already.“ Max turned and walked along the winding concrete maze of the sidewalk, the cool air seeping through his bones as his measured strides hit the asphalt with decisive resolve. Elara , tracing the ripples in the water with her downcast expression, wrung her hands as remained alone on the bench, facing a profound moment of solitude. The disquiet of the three am bustle that only a hospital could generate, other infants crying in distress, machines sounding off alarms, paediatricians rushing to save the lives of fragile babies; Max barely registered it anymore. Lily was finally five months old , and possessing the strength and vitality of the median three month old child. “My bean is now a little cucumber.” he announced as he admired how far she’d progressed, as she unleashed a tiny giggle into the air. Max gave a hearty chuckle as his readjusted the squirming Lily in his lap. “Finally, we’re going home , all the way back to California. And Mr bear her gets the aisle seat , huh?” Max winked at Lily, her entire face enlightening with the promise of a jovial, healthy day, her pulse steady, her respiration clear and sparkling with life. \\"Laugh away bean, the sound is glorious, I bet it could actually cure some cancer, send some kids home\\" .","completion":"Max's jocular comment about Lily's laughter curing cancer is a heartfelt expression of hope and joy, highlighting the positivity that her laughter and improved health bring. The metaphor suggests that her laughter is so vibrant and full of life that it has healing properties, capable of making significant changes. In the context of their situation, with Lily having been in fragile health, her laughter symbolizes not only her recovery but also Max's relief and happiness. Her giggle, against the backdrop of a usually tense hospital environment, represents a moment of normalcy and optimism for Max. It is a stark contrast to the distress and the alarms usually associated with their hospital experience. Lily's recovery and the fact they are preparing to go home to California signify a milestone in her health journey. After the worry and struggle they both endured, Lily's improving health is a beacon of hope. Max's humor, calling her \\"my bean\\" and evolving to \\"a little cucumber\\" expresses the growth and development she has achieved. Max's playful interaction with Lily, assigning Mr. Bear the aisle seat, infuses the grim hospital setting with lightness and anticipation for a brighter future outside its walls. The \\"aisle seat\\" comment creates an endearingly human-like role for Lily's toy, which underscores Max's dedication to creating a happy, hopeful environment for his daughter. Throughout this passage, the emotional rollercoaster that Max and Elara have faced is juxtaposed with the promise of new beginnings, as exemplified by Lily's giggles. These moments of levity are precious and restorative for Max, reaffirming his commitment to his daughter and offering him strength to face whatever comes next."},{"prompt":"При гидратации 22,4 грамм оксида кальция получено 26,64 грамм гидроксида кальция. Определите выход реакции в процентах от теоретически возможного. (Запишите число с точностью до целых.)","completion":"Для расчета выхода реакции нам сначала нужно определить молярную массу оксида кальция (CaO) и гидроксида кальция (Ca(OH)2). Молярная масса CaO = 40,08 (масса кальция) + 16,00 (масса кислорода) = 56,08 г/моль. Молярная масса Ca(OH)2 = 40,08 (масса кальция) + (16,00 * 2 + 1,008 * 2) (масса кислорода и водорода) = 40,08 + 34,016 = 74,096 г/моль. Теперь найдем количество молей оксида кальция: 22,4 г / 56,08 г/моль = 0,4 моль. Уравнение гидратации оксида кальция выглядит следующим образом: CaO + H2O → Ca(OH)2 Из уравнения видно, что 1 моль CaO реагирует с 1 моль H2O с образованием 1 моль Ca(OH)2. Таким образом, теоретически из 0,4 моля CaO мы должны получить 0,4 моля Ca(OH)2. Теперь рассчитаем теоретически возможную массу Ca(OH)2: 0,4 моль * 74,096 г/моль = 29,6384 г. Известно, что практически получилось 26,64 грамм Ca(OH)2. Теперь мы можем вычислить выход реакции: (Полученная масса / Теоретически возможная масса) * 100% = (26,64 г / 29,6384 г) * 100% ≈ 89,88% Таким образом, выход реакции составляет приблизительно 90%."},{"prompt":"Describe aesthetic named anti-afterlifepunk, it's secretly pure dystopian. Actually there is no afterlife to eternal oblivion, can't be empirically revealed, they don't know there is no afterlife but have belief of afterlife.","completion":"Anti-afterlifepunk is a contradictory and hauntingly beautiful aesthetic that delves into themes of nihilism, disillusionment, and the unknown. At first glance, it may appear to be a rebellious rejection of traditional afterlife beliefs, but upon closer inspection, it becomes evident that it is a reflection of a deeply dystopian worldview. Those who subscribe to the anti-afterlifepunk aesthetic are caught in a liminal space between denial and acceptance of the unknown. They cling to their belief in an afterlife, yet are plagued by doubts and fears about the cold, empty void that may await them after death. This conflicting mindset creates a sense of dissonance and unease that permeates their art, fashion, and music. Visually, anti-afterlifepunk is a blend of futuristic and dystopian elements, with sharp angles, metallic textures, and dark, foreboding colors dominating the aesthetic. Symbolism related to death, decay, and oblivion is prevalent, serving as a reminder of the uncertainty that lies beyond the mortal realm. The music associated with anti-afterlifepunk is characterized by discordant melodies, eerie electronic sounds, and haunting lyrics that explore themes of loss, existential dread, and the search for meaning in a world devoid of divine purpose. Overall, anti-afterlifepunk is a paradoxical aesthetic that challenges conventional notions of life, death, and existence. It forces its followers to confront the unsettling possibility that there may be no afterlife, while simultaneously providing them with a sense of comfort and hope in the face of the unknown."},{"prompt":"Idea for anti-afterlifepunk empire, including name","completion":"The Empire of Oblivion. In this dystopian society, the belief in an afterlife is strictly forbidden and actively suppressed by the ruling elite. The citizens are taught that there is no existence beyond the physical realm, and any dissenters are dealt with harshly. The architecture of the Empire of Oblivion reflects the unyielding, stark nature of the anti-afterlife belief system. Buildings are angular, cold, and devoid of any decorative elements, symbolizing the emptiness that awaits in the void of oblivion. The fashion of the empire is similarly austere, with monochromatic colors, sharp lines, and minimalist designs dominating the aesthetic. Accessories such as skull motifs and hourglasses are commonly used to underscore the impermanence of life and the inevitability of death. Music in the Empire of Oblivion is controlled by the state and serves as a propaganda tool to reinforce the anti-afterlife ideology. Artists who dare to explore themes of the afterlife or transcendental experiences are silenced, their work deemed dangerous to the stability of the empire. Despite the oppressive nature of the regime, underground resistance movements quietly flourish, seeking to challenge the ruling elite and its monolithic belief system.

In this aesthetic, the concept of an afterlife is deeply ingrained in the society, with individuals holding strong beliefs in the existence of a paradise or punishment after death. However, in reality, there is no afterlife to look forward to. The truth of eternal oblivion cannot be empirically proven, leading to a sense of uncertainty and fear among the inhabitants of this world. Despite this lack of concrete evidence, the belief in an afterlife persists, shaping the way people live their lives and interact with one another. On the surface, the society built around the idea of an afterlife appears harmonious and idyllic. People strive to be kind, virtuous, and compassionate in the hope of securing a positive outcome in the next life. But beneath this facade of perfection lies a world filled with corruption, deception, and cruelty. Anti-afterlifepunk challenges the notion of utopia and questions the validity of religious beliefs in a world where the existence of an afterlife is a mystery.

With a strawhat perched upon his head, He woke early, leaving his cozy bed. To the garden, he hopped with earnest hops, Tending to tiny seedling tops. This rabbit, he had an ethic so rare, Worked in the garden with utmost care. With paws like shovels, he’d dig and plant, No task too tough, no wish too grand. Patient he was, as all great farmers are, Watching his carrots, shining like stars. Day after day, the sun would climb, And he'd be out there, all the time. The rabbit watered with a gentle touch, To him, these carrots meant so much. He knew well the virtue of the wait, Understanding that growth would come, though late. Amongst the greens, he’d softly sing, A melody of the joy hard work would bring. He’d dance in rain, and bask in glow, A happy rabbit, with energy in tow. His dedication was clear to see, A tiny inspiration he came to be. Neighbors peeked over, curious and keen, At the lushest garden they'd ever seen. They marveled at how his plot did thrive, How each carrot seemed so alive. They asked, \\"What’s the secret? Do share your way!\\" He'd smile and say, \\"It grows a bit each day.\\" He'd rise with the dawn, as pink turned to blue, And work in the glow of the morning's new hue. With strawhat shadowing his earnest face, He taught everyone about grace. Toiling and tilling, no chore dismissed, Every carrot, by his paws, was gently kissed. The rabbit’s routine was indeed firm and set, He worked without rush, without getting upset. His philosophy simple, his mindset clear, \\"Give time to your craft, and keep your heart near.\\" His work was his joy, his garden his throne, In every single seed he sowed, his love was shown. As seasons changed, and time drifted by, The carrot tops brushed against the sky. His work was a whisper, his patience a shout, All his quiet waiting was soon to pan out. Those fine vegetables, from earth they'd debut, A testament to work, tender and true. Finally, the day of harvest arrived, His carrots were ready, their time had thrived. Carefully he picked each, cradling with pride, His happiness and satisfaction he couldn't hide. And though the work was hard, and the wait quite long, It was the rhythm of diligence where he belonged. \\"Slow and steady,\\" the chibi rabbit knew, \\"Leads to rewards and dreams that come true.\\" With a basket of carrots, he sat in the shade, Feeling the peace of the life he had made. His strawhat now resting beside on the grass, He savored the moment, for it too, would pass. So here’s the tale of the rabbit's creed, Of how patience and work fulfill every need. He planted and waited, his ethic a glow, Showing all that it's love that makes a garden grow. For in the end, it's about the journey's part, And the tiny rabbit with the mightiest heart."},{"prompt":"course for instagram marketing master resell simple with only 5 modules 3 lessons each, minimalist tone, table of contents","completion":"Table of Contents Introduction to Instagram Marketing with Master Resell Rights Understanding the Power of Visual Storytelling Setting Up a Magnetic Instagram Profile Module 1: Crafting Your Instagram Strategy Lesson 1.1: Defining Your Brand's Objectives Lesson 1.2: Knowing Your Audience Lesson 1.3: Crafting a Content Plan Module 2: Creating Content That Captivates Lesson 2.1: The Art of Captivating Imagery Lesson 2.2: Engaging Video Content Lesson 2.3: Leveraging User-Generated Content Module 3: Growing Your Instagram Presence Lesson 3.1: Hashtags and Discoverability Lesson 3.2: Cultivating Community Engagement Lesson 3.3: Strategic Following and Partnerships Module 4: Driving Business Results Lesson 4.1: Instagram Advertising Basics Lesson 4.2: Measuring Success and ROI Lesson 4.3: Converting Followers into Customers Module 5: Scaling with Automation and Reselling Lesson 5.1: Tools for Instagram Marketing Automation Lesson 5.2: The Ethics of Automation Lesson 5.3: Setting Up Master Resell Rights for Your Course Conclusion: Launching Your Instagram Marketing Campaign Resource List: Tools and Platforms for Instagram Marketers"},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, Lesson 5.2: The Ethics of Automation, minimalist tone","completion":"Lesson 5.2: The Ethics of Automation Automation involves replacing human tasks with machines or software.

The minimalist approach prioritizes essential tactics, aiming for maximum impact with minimal complexity. 1. **Identify Common Goals:** Recognition of shared objectives is crucial. For instance, a neighborhood might unite to enhance local park safety. 2. **Engage Through Effective Communication:** Simplify messaging. Use straightforward flyers to announce a park cleanup. 3. **Leverage Social Media:** Use platforms judiciously. A single, well-moderated Facebook group can foster discussions and inform members about events. 4. **Organize Events:** Plan simple meetups. A monthly coffee morning at a local café enables residents to connect. 5. **Encourage Volunteering:** Propose manageable tasks. A sign-up sheet at the community center for watering plants streamlines participation. 6. **Seek Feedback:** Provide a simple feedback mechanism. A suggestion box at the community center invites input without overwhelming residents. 7. **Delegate Responsibilities:** Assign clear, specific roles. One person might be responsible for monitoring the suggestion box, ensuring each idea is considered. 8. **Celebrate Successes:** Share victories with minimum fuss. A brief email newsletter can highlight achievements like the installation of new park benches. 9. **Be Inclusive:** Make inclusivity a core principle.

This can be a compelling feature of your product offering, as it grants buyers the opportunity to sell the course themselves and potentially recover their initial purchase cost or even make a profit. Here's how to set up MRR for your course in a minimalist approach: 1. Create Clear Licensing Terms: - Define what buyers can and cannot do with your course. - For example, they can sell it at any price but can't alter the content. 2. Legally Protect Your Course: - Implement copyright notices and trademarks. - Include a license agreement with each purchase. 3. Choose the Right Price Point: - Price your course to reflect the added value of MRR. - Consider a higher price than a standard course but reasonable for resellers. 4. Prepare Marketing Materials: - Provide resellers with sales page templates or graphics. - Make it easy for them to market the course. 5. Select a Delivery System: - Use platforms that support MRR, such as Shopify or Payhip. - Ensure the delivery system secures your digital content. 6. Advertise the MRR Feature: - Highlight the MRR option on your sales page. - Mention the resell benefit in promotional campaigns. For example, if your course teaches photography skills, you would include MRR by offering a license that allows customers to resell the course to other aspiring photographers, doubling as both an educational resource and a business opportunity.

You saw Lily last night?” Max lent his weight to a rigid bench beside where she stood , staring out at the tranquil water , not pressing for details. “Yes , Max, I- it was absolutely heartbreaking, I broke down , and I haven’t slept-. How do you keep standing there, while she-. ” Max held his gaze steady toward the internalising lull of the water’s liquid surface, feeling as in he could fall in and drown as he aligned his back against the wood behind him. “I don’t know , Elara , sometimes I really feel like I’m going insane-but I’m still here . I have to be, and that’s it. She isn’t always in that state, she has her highs , and she’s keeping me going: it’s the difference between emancipation and acceptance I suppose. I mean , don’t you think I know fear, Elara? Real fear. That her last breath is as significant as her first laugh, and I don’t know which I’ll be met with? Or when she’s screaming in pain in the middle of the night and I can’t-“ Max’s eyes fell away as he struggled to find the words “…And yeah, I have to live with that , too” His stare not leaving the lake, Elara joined Max on the bench , her eyes following to where his gaze penetrated the distance. “I just -Max I don’t know if just loving her is enough. A piece of me dies every time she comes so close. It’s like holding together- I don’t know- shattered glass perhaps ? It’s so painful. But she’s a part of me. I gave birth to her, Max- so don’t you dare think- ” “Elara, I’m sorry -“ She inhaled, and her response was barely audible amongst the quiet atmosphere that dissolved the space between them as she leaned against his arm, relenting . “I just feel so guilty , but if I fall apart, what will she have then? Even less. Do you think it’s easy to hold all the pieces together. I can’t control -“ Looking into her eyes with a mix of empathy and utter despair , Max braced his hands on his knees. “Should it be easy? Elara, I know the hell you went through to survive the pregnancy-I nearly lost -No, I can’t do this again, to lose you twice -“ His eyes glassed over as he struggled with the words “I care about you Elara, but-“ he paused, pulling her toward him in a sideways embrace, not meeting her gaze and steeling his composure. “But our child , she’s fighting damn hard to stay alive. And you expect not to fight even harder? “ Max shook his head , torn into splinters that roughened his voice as he removed himself, leaving a chilling gap in his wake. “If you leave again, I don’t know how she’ll do without her mother in her life. But as for us, that door is closing . I can’t stand it Elara, I really can’t-“ . Elara , shrinking into her coat and seeming to guard herself with its layers, dug her nails into her sleeves as she folded her arms, composing herself . “I understand, but I still care about you , Max, even if my own fear has driven us apart-It’s unfair , and I don’t -I don’t want to lose either of you-“ Max , turning his head and meeting Elara with his grave undertone, let the cracks in his voice fill with resolve, his knuckles whitening as his fists clenched. “Elara, fear is not something you get to indulge. What Lily goes through , we can’t afford to let fear take over-you have to fight for her. Please- “ his voice broke away, and he stared at her, awaiting any response , as he ground his palms against the fabric of his jeans . “Max , I - I have caused you so much pain and I don’t deserve the door to even remain ajar but please-“ . Max sighed, his voice a faint whisper of resignation, thick with the strain of a bond that still tied them . “I need some space , you know how to find us if you change your mind about what this involves ., hell, I can’t imagine what it’s been like for you. But I need some time to figure things out, because we’re losing pieces already.“ Max turned and walked along the winding concrete maze of the sidewalk, the cool air seeping through his bones as his measured strides hit the asphalt with decisive resolve. Elara , tracing the ripples in the water with her downcast expression, wrung her hands as remained alone on the bench, facing a profound moment of solitude. The disquiet of the three am bustle that only a hospital could generate, other infants crying in distress, machines sounding off alarms, paediatricians rushing to save the lives of fragile babies; Max barely registered it anymore. Lily was finally five months old , and possessing the strength and vitality of the median three month old child. “My bean is now a little cucumber.” he announced as he admired how far she’d progressed, as she unleashed a tiny giggle into the air. Max gave a hearty chuckle as his readjusted the squirming Lily in his lap. “Finally, we’re going home , all the way back to California. And Mr bear her gets the aisle seat , huh?” Max winked at Lily, her entire face enlightening with the promise of a jovial, healthy day, her pulse steady, her respiration clear and sparkling with life. \\"Laugh away bean, the sound is glorious, I bet it could actually cure some cancer, send some kids home\\" .","completion":"The story you've provided is quite detailed and touching; it's about Elara and Max, who are dealing with the serious illness of their child, Lily. If you are seeking suggestions for continuing the story or analyzing it further, here's a potential continuation based on the text you've provided: --- Elara's world had shrunk down to a series of heartbeats – her daughter's irregular rhythms, juxtaposed with the sound of her own steady pulse, which felt like a relentless drum of guilt. The chill of the waterfront had infiltrated her bones, just as the chill of realisation had settled into her heart. That Max, her rock in this storm, was crumbling under the weight of their shared sorrow. That Lily, her precious child, was clinging to life with the fragile tenacity of a leaf in the wind. As Max walked away, each step was a punctuation mark to the final chapter of what they once had. But even as that particular door swung shut, Elara felt the surge of fight within her. Love and fear had been her constant companions – now it was time for determination to take their hands. Days turned into weeks, and Elara slowly rebuilt her resolve. She immersed herself in understanding Lily's condition, her treatments, her needs. She joined support groups, found other parents battling similar wars, and engaged with therapists. Her knowledge grew, and as it did, so did her confidence. Lily's laughter became the measure of Elara's strength. It was the sound that pulled her from the depths of despair, a beacon of hope in the darkest, longest nights. And as Max prepared to move their little bean turned cucumber across the country, back to California, Elara knew it was time to turn her personal tide. She reached out to Max tentatively, understanding the need for space but also the pull of shared love for their daughter. \\"Max,\\" she began, her voice stronger than it had been by the waterfront, \\"I've been doing some work, soul work, you could say. I've been preparing myself to be the mother – and the partner – that both you and Lily need. I won't pretend that the fear is all gone, but I'm learning to use it, to let it drive me rather than paralyze me.\\" Max looked up, Lily cradled against his chest. \\"What are you saying Elara?\\" \\"That our journey isn't one of distance, from here to California or between our hearts,\\" Elara said, stepping closer, \\"but of finding our way back to each other. For Lily. For us.\\" Lily's giggle filled the space between them like a warm embrace, pulling them subtly together. A close of one chapter, perhaps, but elsewhere, another was just beginning – with laughter that might not cure cancer, but could certainly heal a fractured family."},{"prompt":"I didn’t want a continuation, I want to know if this passage steers clear of purple prose and stays realistic","completion":"The provided passage teeters on the edge of what some might consider purple prose due to its heavy use of metaphor, simile, and emotional descriptors. However, whether it crosses into the territory of purple prose is somewhat subjective and depends on the intended audience’s taste and the context within the larger work. Purple prose is generally characterized by overly elaborate or flowery language that draws attention to itself and away from the narrative or dialogue. It can often feel forced or unnecessary, and may disrupt the pacing or tone of the story. Given that definition, let's analyze your passage: 1. **Emotional Weight**: The passage effectively carries the emotional weight of the situation, conveying deep feelings of despair, hope, and conflict. The descriptions of Max and Elara's internal struggles are visceral and relatable. 2. **Descriptive Language**: The passage uses a lot of descriptive language, with metaphors like \\"shattered glass\\" and expressions such as \\"her pulse steady, her respiration clear and sparkling with life,\\" which can be perceived as rich and evocative or potentially excessive, depending on individual taste. 3. **Realistic Dialogue**: The dialogue between Max and Elara feels realistic in the context of their emotional turmoil. It’s evident that their exchanges are charged with the tension and heartache of their situation. 4. **Pacing and Flow**: The passage contains several long, complex sentences with numerous clauses and descriptions that may slow down the pacing. Shorter sentences and paragraphs might increase readability and keep the action moving. 5. **Context Matters**: Whether the prose is too purple can depend on the context within the larger narrative. If the rest of the story maintains a similar level of descriptive language and introspection, then these paragraphs might fit well. However, if this level of description is not consistent throughout the narrative, it could feel out of place. In summary, while the passage is indeed rich in metaphor and emotional depth, it skirts the line of purple prose without clearly overstepping. To keep it realistic, consider if the emotional and descriptive content serves the story and whether simplifying some sentences might maintain the emotional gravity while improving clarity and pacing."},{"prompt":"Is it ornate or appropriate in detail","completion":"The level of detail in the passage is quite ornate, with expressive language and an abundance of metaphorical descriptions. This ornate style adds to the emotional intensity and reflects the inner turmoil of the characters. Whether this is appropriate depends on a few factors: 1. **Genre and Style**: If the passage is part of a work that generally employs a more poetic, literary, or expressive style, then these details could be seen as appropriate. Audience expectations can vary greatly among genres, and readers of literary fiction might be more receptive to richly detailed prose than those looking for fast-paced genre fiction. 2. **Character and Mood**: The detail also helps to convey the psychological state of the characters and the mood of the scene. If the objective was to immerse the reader in the characters' emotional landscape, the ornate details could be well-suited to that goal. 3. **Consistency**: If the rest of the work is similarly detailed, maintaining a consistent style can make the detail level more appropriate. If this level of description is markedly different from the rest of the text, it might stand out and could be considered less appropriate. 4. **Narrative Flow**: Consider whether the detail supports the flow of the narrative or interrupts it. Ornate details can sometimes slow down the pace, which might be suitable in a scene focusing on internal struggle and reflection, but less so in scenes where quick action or dialogue are central. In conclusion, the passage is on the ornate side, but whether the level of detail is appropriate depends on the context of the scene within the whole work, the overall style and genre, and the author's intentions for the effect of the passage on the reader."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, Module 5: Scaling with Automation and Reselling, minimalist tone","completion":"Module 5 focuses on two key strategies for growing a business: scaling through automation and reselling. Here, we'll delve into the aspects and application of both, highlighting their benefits in a minimalist and efficient approach. **Scaling with Automation** Automation is utilizing technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention. It's about streamlining operations to increase efficiency and capacity. *Examples of Automation:* 1. *CRM Systems*: Using Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software to automatically track customer interactions, sales, and after-sales support. 2. *Email Marketing*: Implementing email automation tools for sending out newsletters, follow-up emails, or targeted campaigns based on customer behavior. 3. *Manufacturing*: Deploying robots and assembly lines that work around the clock, producing goods faster and with consistent quality. 4. *E-commerce*: Integrating an inventory management system that syncs across all sales channels to automatically update stock levels. *Benefits of Automation:* - **Efficiency**: Reduces time spent on repetitive tasks. - **Accuracy**: Decreases human error. - **Consistency**: Ensures uniform output. - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Saves on labor costs in the long run. - **Growth**: Allows businesses to handle increased volume without proportionate increases in staffing. **Reselling** Reselling involves purchasing goods or services to sell them to others. It’s a straightforward business model where profit is made by adding a margin to the purchased cost. *Examples of Reselling:* 1. *Retail Arbitrage*: Buying discounted products from retail stores or online marketplaces to resell at higher prices. 2. *Wholesale Distribution*: Purchasing bulk items from manufacturers and selling them to retailers or directly to consumers. 3. *Digital Products*: Acquiring licenses for software, eBooks, or courses, and reselling access. *Benefits of Reselling:* - **Low Barrier to Entry**: Often requires less initial product development and lower startup costs. - **Flexibility**: Can operate in various markets and scale by adding more products. - **Profitability**: Margins can be substantial if products are sourced at significantly lower prices than selling prices. *Strategies for Effective Reselling:* - **Market Research**: Identifying trending products that are in demand. - **Supplier Relationships**: Building good relationships with suppliers for better pricing. - **Customer Insight**: Understanding your customers’ needs and catering to them effectively. In conclusion, Module 5 advocates for the power of automation in boosting productivity, and reselling as a tactical approach to business expansion. These strategies, when correctly applied, serve to increase a business's reach and profitability with minimal complication."},{"prompt":"Describe aesthetic named anti-afterlifepunk, it's pure dystopian superficially disguised in utopia.

It reflects a society that is obsessed with the idea of an afterlife and the pursuit of immortality, despite there being no empirical evidence to support such beliefs. In this dystopian world, people cling to the hope of an afterlife as a means of escaping the harsh realities of their existence. They live in a superficially perfect society, where everything appears ideal on the surface, but underneath lies a deep sense of despair and emptiness. The members of the anti-afterlifepunk movement reject traditional religious beliefs and instead embrace a more nihilistic worldview. They are drawn to the aesthetic of decay and destruction, finding beauty in the impermanence of life and the inevitability of death. Despite their disbelief in an afterlife, the followers of anti-afterlifepunk still hold onto a sense of hope and faith in something beyond this world. They may not know for certain that there is no afterlife, but they choose to believe in it as a way of coping with the harsh realities of their existence.

The citizens of The Empire of Oblivion are taught from a young age to embrace the impermanence of life and to accept the inevitability of death. The society is governed by a strict set of laws and regulations that dictate every aspect of life, from personal beliefs to daily routines. The aesthetic of The Empire of Oblivion is one of decay and destruction, with crumbling buildings and overgrown foliage serving as a constant reminder of the impermanence of life. The citizens of the empire find beauty in the chaos and destruction, seeing it as a reflection of the ultimate truth of existence. Despite the bleak and nihilistic worldview of The Empire of Oblivion, its citizens continue to hold onto a sense of hope and purpose.

Engaging video content is more than just visual appeal; it's about creating a connection with your audience through clear, concise, and compelling storytelling that resonates with their interests and needs. **Key Components for Engaging Videos:** 1. **Simplicity:** A minimalist approach ensures that the core message isn't lost in the complexities of overproduction. For example, a simple vlog with a clear thesis can be more engaging than a high-budget video with no clear focus. 2. **Clarity:** Make certain that your video has a well-defined purpose. An explainer video, using minimalistic graphics and straightforward language, can demystify a complex concept much better than a video packed with technical jargon and excessive animation. 3. **Authenticity:** A genuine delivery connects more deeply than a performance. A minimalist might merely sit in a monochromatic room sharing a personal story, allowing the authenticity of their message to shine through without distractions. 4. **Value:** Every second of your video should offer value. Whether you're educating, informing, or entertaining, ensure your content is lean and free of fluff. A tutorial video that goes straight to the point, with clear steps and no unnecessary commentary, respects the viewer's time and aids in engagement. 5. **Visual Impact:** A minimalist approach in visuals can lead to a more engaging experience. A clean and uncluttered visual style with a strong color contrast or a single striking image can capture attention more effectively than an overly busy and chaotic scene. **Creating Engaging Content – A Minimalist's Framework:** 1. **Beginning (Introduction):** Start with a hook that's direct and immediately intriguing. For instance, a video discussing productivity might begin with a compelling question or a startling statistic about time-wasting. 2. **Middle (Development):** Here, sustain interest by expanding on your initial points with precise explanations or demonstrations. Use concise, bite-sized content snippets that viewer's can easily digest and remember. 3. **End (Conclusion):** Wrap up with a clear and succinct summary, reinforcing the main message. End with a call-to-action that is straightforward and easy for the audience to follow. 4. **Technical Execution:** Use clean camera work, simple lighting, and minimal editing tricks. The focus should be on the content, not the flashiness of the video presentation. **Examples of Engaging Minimalist Video Content:** 1. **Unboxing Videos:** A plain background with a clear view of the product allows viewers to focus on the features and benefits without distractions. 2. **Educational Content:** A well-structured screencast with a simple interface helps learners concentrate on the information being presented. 3. **Testimonials:** Real stories from customers or clients filmed in a neutral environment allow the message to be the primary focus. 4. **Product Demos:** A straightforward, no-frills demonstration that highlights the product use and effectiveness without unnecessary elements. In essence, to make your video content engaging while keeping a minimalist tone, you'll want to ensure it's straightforward, honest, and valuable, avoiding any excess that could dilute your message or distract your audience.

This approach taps into our instinctive ability to process and remember visual information rapidly and emotionally. For instance, consider an advertising campaign for a new smartphone. Instead of listing specs, a series of images showcases the phone's features through daily life situations—a photo captures the device’s crisp display with a stunning sunrise, another shows a group selfie at a party, vividly emphasizing the camera's wide-angle lens, and a video displays the phone surviving a drop into a pool, highlighting its water resistance. These visuals tell a persuasive story of the phone's capabilities integrated into real-life experiences. Visual storytelling in a minimalist tone emphasizes the \\"less is more\\" philosophy. It involves stripping away clutter and focusing on the essentials to create a powerful narrative. Apple's product unveilings are a classic example; their presentations and promotional materials typically feature a clean, distraction-free aesthetic that places the product front and center. The visual narrative conveys innovation, quality, and ease of use without overwhelming the viewer. Another example could be a photo essay capturing the simplicity and serenity of life in a remote village. The absence of modern distractions in the visuals directs the viewer's focus to the subjects' emotions and the surrounding natural beauty—drawing a stark contrast to the busyness of urban life, encouraging audiences to reflect on simplicity and contentment. By leveraging the power of visual storytelling, creators and brands can craft memorable, impactful narratives that resonate on a deeper level and stand out in a crowded media landscape—all with a minimalist tone that speaks volumes through simplicity."},{"prompt":"Non capisco cosa sbaglio in questo ragionamento: La greedy best frist è un algoritmo A f(n) = g(n) + h(n) in cui g(n)=0; Se io considero un euristica ammissibile cioè in cui h è una sottostima di h*(n) Allora l'algoritmo A preso in considerazione con un euristica ammissibile è anche un algoritmo A* Cosideriamo anche che l'euristica sia consistente e che quindi h(n) <= h(n')+c(n,a,n') Allora l'algoritmo A* è ottimale.

In content creation, minimalism means distilling information to its essence. This module will guide you through crafting captivating content with brevity and clarity without sacrificing depth or interest. Key Concepts - **Simplicity is King**: Get to the point. Avoid fluff and focus on what's necessary to convey the message. - **Whitespace is Your Friend**: Use it liberally to give content room to breathe, encouraging engagement without overwhelming your audience. - **Clarity Above All**: Choose words wisely. Simple language often has the most significant impact. - **Purposeful Structure**: Organize your content so readers can follow with ease. Lead them through your thoughts succinctly. - **Engagement Through Relevance**: Connect with audiences quickly by staying topical and relevant - less is often more. Examples 1. **Headlines That Hook**: A captivating headline is concise and to the point. For example: - Cluttered: \\"10 Amazingly Efficient Ways You Can Clean Up Your Workspace and Make It Look More Professional\\" - Minimalist: \\"10 Tips for a Cleaner Desk\\" 2. **Emails That Get Opened**: Keep emails brief and with a direct call to action. - Cluttered: \\"We've got several amazing offers this week on many of our products that you might like to buy, from discounts on our top sellers to clearance items that are an absolute steal...\\" - Minimalist: \\"Exclusive Deals: Save Big on Top Sellers\\" 3. **Blog Posts That Engage**: Short paragraphs, subheadings, and bullet points make information digestible. - Cluttered: A lengthy introduction recounting the history of productivity methods. - Minimalist: \\"Boosting productivity starts with three key habits...\\" 4. **Social Media That Stands Out**: Use impactful images and succinct text to grab and hold attention. - Cluttered: A busy graphic with a long-winded post about lifestyle changes. - Minimalist: A simplistic graphic with the text, \\"Transform with three habits.\\" 5. **Presentations That Persuade**: Use minimal text per slide and compelling visuals to drive your point home. A minimalistic presentation might, for example, utilize a single striking image with one powerful statistic overlayed versus a slide crammed with bullet points. Exercises - **Trim the Fat**: Take a paragraph from your previous work and cut it down by at least half without losing meaning. - **Whitespace Workout**: Take a page of content and increase the whitespace by adjusting layouts and paragraph sizes. Notice the visual impact. - **Clarity Challenge**: Replace jargon and complex phrases in your content with simple, everyday language. Further Reading - \\"On Writing Well\\" by William Zinsser - Although not about minimalism per se, it's a seminal work on clear writing. - \\"The Elements of Style\\" by Strunk and White - A classic resource on how to write using fewer words. Tools - **Grammarly**: Helps in tightening up your writing by identifying superfluous words and phrases. - **Hemingway Editor**: Analyzes your text for readability, encouraging more straightforward, more potent sentences. Conclusion Captivating content in a minimalist tone is about engaging your audience quickly and effectively. It's an exercise in restraint and focus, where every word works hard, and every design element serves a purpose. Practice minimalism, and your message will resonate clearer and longer."},{"prompt":"generate more comprehensive details and examples on, Lesson 2.1: The Art of Captivating Imagery, minimalist tone","completion":"**Lesson 2.1: The Art of Captivating Imagery – A Minimalist Approach** --- # Introduction: Imagery is the use of visually descriptive or figurative language to represent objects, actions, or ideas. In minimalist imagery, less is more. The goal is to evoke a vivid picture, emotion, or concept using sparse but powerful elements. This lesson will guide you through employing a minimalist tone in your imagery to create compelling and memorable visual impressions with fewer words but greater impact. # Visual Precision with Minimal Words: Minimalist imagery relies on pinpoint precision with language. The chosen words are deliberate, aiming to evoke the essence of a scene or object. - **Example**: Instead of describing a \\"bright, warm, bustling summer day in the park,\\" a minimalist might simply say, \\"The summer park hummed under a golden sun.\\" # Suggestive Imagery: Instead of dictating every visual detail, suggest a scene and let the reader's imagination fill in the blanks. - **Example**: Rather than expounding on the \\"detailed wrinkles and texture of an old man's hands,\\" you might write, \\"His hands whispered tales of decades past.\\" # Metaphor and Simile: Effective use of metaphors and similes can convey complex images and emotions with simple terms. - **Example**: To illustrate a \\"cluster of skyscrapers at dusk,\\" describe it as \\"the city’s teeth biting the purple sky.\\" # Focused Descriptions: Concentrate on a singular aspect that captures the essence of the scene or subject. This draws the reader’s attention to a focal point, creating a powerful image. - **Example**: Describe a forest scene with \\"A single red leaf fluttered to the ground,\\" focusing on the leaf rather than the entire forest. # The Power of Color: A single color can set a scene or mood. Use it sparingly for significant impact. - **Example**: To evoke the feeling of loneliness in a room, just say, \\"Blue shadows clung to the corners.\\" # Negative Space: What is not said can be as evocative as what is. Use negative space by focusing on what's missing to highlight what's present. - **Example**: Show emotional distance with \\"The unsaid words between them were loud.\\" # Rhythm and Sound: Sound can be used minimally to create a backdrop for imagery. Choose words with natural rhythm or onomatopoeia. - **Example**: Convey the tranquility of a beach with \\"Waves whispered to the shore.\\" # Conclusion: Minimalism in imagery is not about the absence of detail but the mastery of selectivity. Crafting captivating imagery with a minimalist tone involves choosing each word like a painter chooses a brushstroke – with intent and purpose. It's about distilling the essence of a scene into a few choice elements that stand vividly in the reader’s mind. The magic of minimalist imagery lies in its brevity and the spaciousness it leaves for the reader's imagination. # Writing Exercise: 1. Choose a complex scene. 2.

In fact, a minimalist approach can often yield a more focused and authentic engagement with your audience. The notion is straightforward: less is more. To deploy your Instagram marketing campaign with minimalism at its core, prioritize high-quality content over quantity. Each post should serve a purpose, be it showcasing your latest product, sharing customer testimonials, or simply providing an aesthetic that aligns with your brand image. Remain consistent with your visual and narrative theme, letting your brand's essence radiate clearly through each post. Examples: - Opt for a clean, uniform look in your feed, perhaps by using a consistent filter or color scheme that reflects your brand's mood. - Instead of overloading followers with multiple daily posts, consider carefully crafted, less frequent updates that spark more significant interactions. - Apply the Pareto principle (80/20 rule) to focus 80% of your effort on content that engages 20% of your most influential followers. Invoke stories and reels to connect with followers on a more personal level, displaying the human aspect of your brand without cluttering their feeds. When you do share promotional material, ensure it meshes seamlessly with the overall vibe of your page. Above all, remember that the end goal is to establish genuine relationships with your followers, foster community, and naturally steer your audience toward your objectives, all while retaining a sense of simplicity and clarity.

It provides a roadmap to the reader by giving an overview of the structure and helps in navigating to specific sections quickly. In a minimalist tone, a TOC should adhere to simplicity and clarity, avoiding any unnecessary embellishments or intricate designs. Comprehensive Details on Table of Contents in a Minimalist Tone: - **Functionality**: The primary role of a minimalist TOC is functionality. It should efficiently guide the reader through the document’s layout, focusing on legibility and ease of use rather than decorative features. - **Design**: Minimalist TOCs tend to feature clean lines, ample white space, and a straightforward typeface. A sans-serif font like Helvetica or Arial is often chosen for its readability and modern appearance. - **Hierarchy**: Information is usually organized by chapters, sections, and subsections. In the minimalist approach, hierarchy is conveyed through simple formatting choices such as bold or capitalized headers for chapters, and indentations or a slight change in font weight for sub-sections. - **Paging**: Page numbers are clearly stated and aligned in a consistent manner, typically on the right side of the TOC, to make it easy for readers to flip directly to the desired page. - **Titles**: The titles of sections and chapters are descriptive yet concise, avoiding verbose descriptions or unnecessary subheadings. - **Color**: If color is used at all, it will be applied sparingly to draw attention to particular elements like chapter titles, without overwhelming the layout.

The aim is to create a content strategy that effectively communicates your message without over-complication or excess. **Step 1: Define Your Goals** Clearly state what you hope to achieve with your content. Goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). For instance, increasing website traffic by 20% within the next six months is a specific and measurable goal. **Step 2: Identify Your Audience** Understand who you are talking to. Analyze your audience's demographics, interests, and behaviors. By knowing their likes and pain points, you can create content that resonates. For example, if your target audience is young professionals, you might focus on creating streamlined, direct content that respects their time constraints. **Step 3: Content Categories** Choose a few broad categories that align with your brand and audience. For instance, a minimalist lifestyle brand might select categories like \\"Simplicity Tips,\\" \\"Minimalist Home,\\" and \\"Mindfulness.\\" **Step 4: Content Types** Decide the types of content you'll produce. Embrace forms that convey your message with brevity and impact. Options include blog posts, infographics, videos, or podcasts. A minimalist might prioritize a short blog post or a simple infographic over long-form articles or complex charts. **Step 5: Channel Selection** Pick the most appropriate platforms where your audience is likely to engage. Don't spread yourself too thin. If your research shows your audience predominantly uses Instagram and email, concentrate your efforts there. **Step 6: Editorial Calendar** Create a calendar to schedule when and where content will be posted. This should include publication dates, platforms, and responsibilities. Keep it uncluttered with only essential information; an example might be a weekly infographic on simplicity every Wednesday on Instagram. **Step 7: Creation and Curation** Develop your content, ensuring it stays true to your minimalist ethos. This means clear, concise language, clean design, and straightforward messages. If curating content, choose pieces that reflect your minimalist values. For example, you might share a clean, visually appealing quote about minimalism on your social media channels. **Step 8: Distribution and Promotion** Distribute your content according to the calendar. For promotion, use a simple, repeatable strategy. For instance, every time a new blog post goes live, it's shared once on all chosen social media platforms with a clear call-to-action. **Step 9: Measurement and Analysis** Use tools to track your content's performance. Look at metrics like engagement rates, click-through rates, and conversion rates. Keep data analysis reports straightforward—focus on key metrics that indicate progress toward your goals. **Step 10: Review and Adjust** Review your content's performance and the overall effectiveness of your content plan regularly. Make adjustments as needed, but always through the lens of your minimalist principles. For example, if a certain content type isn't resonating, consider refining the message rather than adding more complexity. **Examples:** - **Blog Post**: A 500-word post on \\"5 Ways to De-clutter Your Workspace,\\" with a clean layout and high-quality, but sparse, images. - **Infographic**: A single graphic illustrating \\"The Minimalist's Guide to a Capsule Wardrobe,\\" using a monochromatic color scheme and simple icons. - **Video Content**: A one-minute time-lapse video of a room transformation from cluttered to minimalist, with a calming soundtrack and no dialogue."},{"prompt":"Please write an exciting sports story about a very muddy rugby match between two rival girls schools.

It was the day of the infamous rugby match, where the two rival girls' schools clashed in a show of muddy valor. The skies looked menacing, heavy with clouds, as the girls from both teams lined up on the pitch, grinning from ear to ear. For them, the thick, sticky mud that coated the ground was not an obstacle, but an added element of excitement. This was no genteel sports day; this was a true test of mettle and camaraderie. As the whistle blew, the game began with a ferocity that matched the weather. Ravenscroft's star player, Charlotte \\"Charging\\" Benson, seized the ball with the tenacity of a born warrior. Plowing through the soupy terrain, her uniform became a second skin of mud. It was as if she wore a badge of honor. Woodford Hall's answer to Charlotte was their quick-footed winger, Amelia \\"The Dart\\" Jenkins. Despite the slippery pitch, her agility was unmatched. When Amelia made a darting run, even the thick mud couldn't slow her down. But after a swift tackle from Ravenscroft's fullback, her raven hair bore streaks of brown, and her chuckle was heard above the crowd's cheers. Parents lined the sidelines, some aghast at the sludge-soaked spectacle. \\"They'll catch their death in this muck!\\" exclaimed one concerned mother. Yet, their protests were drowned out by the roaring encouragement from fellow students, who celebrated every tackle, and every triumphant rise from the mud. The game was a parade of determination. Grace \\"Iron Grip\\" Thompson from Ravenscroft intercepted a key pass, her hands so muddy the ball nearly slipped away—but her focus never wavered. On the other side, Woodford's \\"Bulldozer\\" Bethany Collins answered by pushing through the mire, her legs driving like pistons, carrying defenders along for the ride. At halftime, the score was deadlocked. As the teams huddled, covered head to toe in mud, there was no sign of dismay. Instead, laughter echoed, teammates high-fived, and eyes sparkled with unspoken camaraderie. The true spirit of rugby, of mutual respect, and love for the sport shone through, despite the dwindling cleanliness of their kits. In the second half, the battle grew ever muddier. Every scrum was a whirlpool of muddled jerseys, with players from both teams emerging more camouflaged by the churned earth. The ball itself became a slippery eel, eluding capture amidst the grunts and shouts of exertion. The defining moment came when \\"Charging\\" Charlotte, breaking away once more, slipped up on a particularly devious patch of mud. Yet as she fell, she flicked the ball towards Jenna \\"The Cannon\\" Matthews. With the clock ticking down and Ravenscroft trailing by two, Jenna—mud plastered to her face, obscuring her trademark freckles—scooped up the ball and thundered towards the try line. Tackles came in from all sides, but Jenna was unstoppable, diving over the line as the muddy pool exploded around her. The referee's whistle pierced the air, signaling a Ravenscroft victory. The cheers from their supporters were as loud as they were joyous. Amelia and Bethany led Woodford Hall in a gracious concession, their smiles as bright as their futures. As the girls shook hands, their laughter rang out. The muck, the grime—it was all part of the glorious fun. \\"Who needs boring traditional sports when you can play rugby in the mud?\\" jested Charlotte, echoing the sentiment of all. When the final cheers subsided, and the girls walked off the field, their already indecipherable numbers hidden beneath layers of earth, the lesson was clear: in the thick of life's messiest battles, there's always joy to be found—even deep in the heart of the muddiest rugby match."},{"prompt":"Please write about Jenna's dive into the muddy pool.

Jenna, with her dauntless spirit, charged toward the try line, the sound of her cleats squelching against the mire a testament to the sodden battlefield. The opposition loomed before her, hands outstretched, ready to send her sprawling. Yet, Jenna knew the art of the game—the dive was everything. Deep within the heart of Ravenscroft territory lay her goal, girdled by a moat of treacherous mud. Drawing a deep breath, she launched herself into the air with a valiant leap. For a moment, she soared—a rugby phoenix rising from the ashes of a grueling game—before gravity beckoned her to the earth. Jenna connected with the churning mud below, the squelch of impact drowned by the roar of the crowd. A tidal wave of gunk splashed upwards, coating her further in a layer of earthy armor.

Then, after retrieving that array, you attempt to set the \`people\` store with the array instead of a count which is what your homepage appears to expect. Here are the parts where discrepancies occur: Firestore file: \`\`\`javascript export let people = writable(0) // This suggests \`people\` is a count (number), not an array // ... getTotalNumberOfPeople().then((out) => { if(out){ people.set(out) // here you are setting \`people\` store with an array which contradicts the initial definition }); // ... \`\`\` To fix this, you should change the line \`people.set(out)\` to \`people.set(out.length)\` in case you want to store the number of people detected. Additionally, there is a call to \`setPeople()\` which is not defined anywhere in your provided code. If \`setPeople\` is meant to be a function, you should make sure it's defined or remove this line if it's unnecessary. Svelte Homepage: \`\`\`svelte <script> // ... let totalNumberOfPeopleArray = people // implies people is an array // ... const unsubscribePeople = people.subscribe((value) => { totalNumberOfPeopleArray = value; // since \`people\` was meant to be a count, this is incorrect usage // ... }); // ... <\/script> \`\`\` Since you initially planned for \`people\` to be a count of detections, you should not use it as if it's an array. The subscription should reflect this. For example: \`\`\`javascript const unsubscribePeople = people.subscribe((value) => { up = 0; down = 0; // Since \`people\` is a count now, you don't loop over it. // Instead, you should fetch the whole list if you need to calculate 'up' and 'down'. // ... Calculate up and down based on latest data if needed getCrowdnessIndicator(); }); \`\`\` If you indeed need the array of detected people in the Svelte component to calculate \\"up\\" and \\"down\\", you need to change the Firestore file to return and set the count correctly and potentially introduce another store for the list of detections. Also, be sure that your unsubscribe functions properly clean up the subscriptions when the component is destroyed, which currently they do: \`\`\`svelte onDestroy(() => { unsubscribeOccupants(); unsubscribeUnits(); unsubscribePeople(); unsubscribeCapacity(); }); \`\`\` Lastly, ensure that your components are properly reactive in Svelte; remember to use the \`\` symbol to access the value of stores, like \`people\`, when needed inside your HTML markup for reactivity, but not in your script logic for subscriptions. By fixing these issues, you should be able to have a reactive display of the number of detected people from Firestore in real-time in your Svelte web app."},{"prompt":"i forgot i don't need to calculate up and down since in my CV the detections happen on the ROI so if there is a person detected on the ROI it updates the count and if the person is not on the ROI so the count will decrement","completion":"If your computer vision (CV) system updates the count in Firebase to reflect the current number of people within the region of interest (ROI), then your Firestore and Svelte code should only need to reflect this count. You don't need to calculate 'up' and 'down' as these would be handled by your CV system that is updating Firebase. Javascript Firestore file, exporting \`people\` as a writable store and using a listener to keep it up-to-date with the Firestore document changes: \`\`\`javascript import { collection, getDocs, onSnapshot } from \\"firebase/firestore\\"; import db from \\"../auth/firestore\\"; // ensure this is correctly importing your initialized Firestore instance import { writable } from \\"svelte/store\\"; export const people = writable(0); // Listener to update the count whenever there are changes in Firestore onSnapshot(collection(db, \\"Detections\\"), (snapshot) => { // Assuming your detections collection updates a dedicated count document // e.g., a \\"currentCount\\" document with a \\"count\\" field const countDoc = snapshot.docs.find(doc => doc.id === \\"currentCount\\"); if (countDoc) { people.set(countDoc.data().count); } else { console.error(\\"Count document not found in the Detections collection\\"); } }, error => { console.error(error); }); \`\`\` In this code, it's assumed that your detections collection in Firestore has a specific document (e.g., with the id \\"currentCount\\") that stores the current count of people within the ROI. If your detections are individual documents for each person detected, you'll need to adjust the listener's callback to aggregate the current count appropriately. Svelte Homepage component that uses the \`people\` store to display the current count to the user: \`\`\`svelte <script> // Import the \`people\` store to access the count import { people } from \\"../firebase/firestore\\"; // onDestroy from Svelte is used to clean up subscriptions when the component is destroyed. // Since your store should be updated from the Firestore listener you don't need additional // logic here, just use \`people\` directly in the markup. <\/script> <!-- Your component's HTML here, showing the current number of people --> <div> <h1>Current Count</h1> <p>The current number of people in the ROI: {people}</p> <!-- More of your application's markup --> </div> \`\`\` This component listens to changes in the \`people\` store, and it will reactively update in the UI whenever the store's value changes due to Firestore updates. The \`people\` syntax is used to automatically subscribe to the store's changes in the Svelte template. Please be sure that the Firestore database security rules allow the read operations your web app requires. If they are misconfigured, your app will not receive updates, and the onSnapshot listener will return an error. By following this structure, your web app should be able to display the reactive amount of people detected based on the detections of the CV system in real time, provided the CV updates the Firestore count correctly."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Why is that?","completion":"The conversion of plain quotes to typographic (fancy) quotes is not something that is controlled or performed by ChatGPT. Instead, it sounds like the issue might be occurring due to the text rendering or auto-formatting settings of the platform or software you are using to view or copy the text. Many text editors, word processors, and communication apps have auto-formatting features that automatically replace plain quotes with typographic quotes, as the latter are often preferred for published and printed text due to their aesthetic appeal. For instance, Microsoft Word and some email clients have this feature enabled by default. When writing or working with code, it's important to turn off these auto-formatting features to prevent issues like this from occurring since programming and scripting languages require the use of plain ASCII characters for quotes. To avoid this issue, you might consider the following: 1. Copy the text directly from the ChatGPT interface, as it provides plain text without any additional formatting. 2. Paste the copied text into a plain text editor like Notepad (on Windows), which doesn't apply any auto-formatting. 3. If you are using a rich text editor or word processor, look for an option to turn off smart quotes or auto-formatting features. 4. Check the pasting options if your editor provides choices like \\"Paste as plain text\\" or similar. If you are copying and pasting the code into an environment where you need to disable such features, please refer to the application's documentation or support resources for specific instructions on how to do so."},{"prompt":"This is happening in the html dialog in huggingface.co/spaces.

While you might not have control over the CSS of huggingface.co/spaces, you can try a couple of things to ensure the quotes remain simple: 1. **Control Characters:** Use HTML control characters when displaying plain text code snippets in HTML. Instead of simply typing double quotes (\\") or single quotes ('), you can use: - \`&quot;\` for double quotes. - \`&apos;\` or \`&#39;\` for single quotes. 2. **Copy from Source Code:** If you have access to the source code of the text, copy the text directly from the source instead of the rendered output. 3. **Browser Extensions:** Some browser extensions allow you to disable smart quotes or manage how text is copied and pasted. You might search for an extension compatible with your browser that prevents the conversion of plain quotes to smart quotes. 4. **Feedback to Platform:** If the automatic conversion is problematic and you believe it's occurring server-side or within the huggingface.co/spaces environment, consider reaching out to the platform's support or providing feedback, as this might be something that affects many users who are working with code. For now, if you're copying code from the output that I provide and need to ensure the quotes remain simple, paste the text first into a basic text editor like Notepad (not Wordpad or Microsoft Word), then copy it out of there to retain the simple quotes.

Toisin sanoen, se on joukko elementtejä, jotka ovat vain toisessa joukossa, mutta eivät molemmissa. Esimerkiksi, jos meillä on kaksi joukkoa: A = {1, 2, 3} B = {3, 4, 5} Niin symmetrinen erotus (A Δ B) koostuu niistä alkioista, jotka ovat vain jommassa kummassa joukossa, ei molemmissa: A Δ B = {1, 2, 4, 5} Koska 3 on molemmissa joukoissa, se ei kuulu symmetriseen erotukseen.

ServiceNow's client scripts run on the client's browser, and to get the attachments count, you need to interact with the server because attachment data is stored on the server side. Here is how you can do it using an onSubmit client script: 1. First, you need to create a Script Include that will handle the server-side logic of counting attachments. Example Script Include: \`\`\`javascript var AttachmentUtils = Class.create(); AttachmentUtils.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, getAttachmentCount: function(sysId) { var attachment = new GlideRecord('sys_attachment'); attachment.addQuery('table_sys_id', sysId); attachment.query(); var count = 0; while (attachment.next()) { count++; } return count; }, type: 'AttachmentUtils' }; \`\`\` 2. Then, in your client script, you will need to use an \`onSubmit\` script to call the server-side code, which will count the number of attachments. Example onSubmit Client Script: \`\`\`javascript function onSubmit() { // Get the current sys_id of the catalog item - if this is a submission, it may not have a sys_id yet var sysId = g_form.getUniqueValue(); // Call the server from the client script using GlideAjax var ga = new GlideAjax('AttachmentUtils'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getAttachmentCount'); ga.addParam('sysparm_sys_id', sysId); // This callback function will process the asynchronous GlideAjax response ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer) { var attachmentCount = parseInt(answer, 10); if (attachmentCount == 0) { // Handle your validation if there are no attachments g_form.addErrorMessage(\\"Please add an attachment before submitting.\\"); g_form.preventDefault(); // prevent the form from being submitted } // If there are attachments, the form will be submitted normally }); // Mostrar return false; // the form will wait for the callback; make sure to remove this line if you don't want to wait } \`\`\` A few things to note about the code above: - The sys_id (unique identifier for each record) is used to retrieve the attachments related to the specific record. - \`GlideAjax\` is used to send an asynchronous request to the server-side \`Script Include\`. The \`getXMLAnswer\` method is provided a callback function to handle the response. - You must provide error handling within the callback function to determine what should happen if there are no attachments. - If the record has not been created yet (no sys_id available), counting attachments directly associated with it isn't feasible. You might need to manage attachments in the frontend and only check for their count upon submission. - When using \`g_form.preventDefault()\`, the form submission will be blocked. However, this only works synchronously, so you might need to always return \`false\` from \`onSubmit\` and then handle form submission manually based on the answer from the server, which can make things complex due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript. Please test any script thoroughly in a development environment before implementing it in a production environment. Customizing client scripts can have various side effects if not handled correctly, including performance impacts or unexpected behaviors in the ServiceNow instance."},{"prompt":"Summarize the science mentioned in this article: https://m.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/129544/the-science-behind-jaiswals-power-game","completion":"The article discusses the science behind the power game of Indian cricketer Yashasvi Jaiswal.

The root of these words, \\"няш-\\", is a made-up term that's particularly popular on the internet and among younger people. Below are the meanings in the order you listed them: 1. **Няшно (Nyashno):** This is an adverb that might be translated as \\"cutely\\" or \\"adorably.\\" It describes an action or a manner that is done in a cute way. 2. **Няша (Nyasha):** This is a noun used to refer to a person (often a girl or a baby animal) who is very cute or sweet. It can be a term of endearment akin to \\"sweetie\\" or \\"cutie.\\" 3. **Няшка (Nyashka):** Similar to \\"няша\\" but can also imply diminutive or endearing qualities, much like adding \\"-ie\\" or \\"-y\\" in English (e.g., puppy vs. dog). 4. **Няшечка (Nyashechka):** This is a diminutive form of \\"няша,\\" making it even more endearing, like \\"little cutie\\" or \\"sweetie pie.\\" 5. **Няшный (Nyashny):** This is an adjective that describes something as being cute or adorable. It could be translated as \\"cute\\" or \\"charming.\\" 6. **Няшечный (Nyashechny):** This is another variation of the adjective with a diminutive nuance, emphasizing the cuteness or adorability even more. The usage of these words often conveys a playful, informal tone and is typically not found in formal writing or speech."},{"prompt":"Where did these words come from in Russian?","completion":"The term \\"няша\\" and its derivatives gained widespread popularity in Russian internet culture and are particularly associated with the anime and gaming communities. It is not entirely clear where the word originated from, but it appears to be an example of mimetic or expressive language that evolved organically within online communities, likely influenced by the Japanese culture of using cute expressions and terms, known as \\"kawaii.\\" Anime, manga, and Japanese pop culture have had a considerable influence on youth culture around the world. As Russian fans of anime started to embrace aspects of this culture, they adopted and created their own slang terms to express similar sentiments. The term \\"няша\\" fits well within this context as a way to express that something is endearing or adorable, akin to the Japanese notion of \\"kawaii.\\" \\"Няша\\" and its variants (e.g., \\"няшно,\\" \\"няшка,\\" \\"няшечка,\\" \\"няшный,\\" \\"няшечный\\") became popular slang terms and eventually spread beyond the confines of anime and gaming communities to be used more generally among young people in Russian-speaking internet communities. Because the word is a relatively recent invention from internet culture, it is probably not found in traditional dictionaries or literature but has become part of more informal, everyday language among certain demographics in Russia and other Russian-speaking regions."},{"prompt":"It is said to be from the Japanese word \\"ニャー\\". Are there analogues of these expressions in English anime slang? It is from anime slang, and not English slang at all.","completion":"The Japanese word \\"ニャー\\" (nyā), which is the onomatopoeia for a cat's meow (\\"meow\\" in English), has become associated with cuteness and is often used in anime and manga. This association is likely due to the prevalence of cute cat-like characters in anime and the general Japanese cultural fascination with all things \\"kawaii\\" (cute). In English anime-related slang, an equivalent expression for cuteness and the idea of something being endearingly adorable would be the use of the word \\"kawaii\\" itself, which has been borrowed from Japanese. English-speaking fans of anime and manga cultures often embrace the term \\"kawaii\\" to describe cute characters or styles. While English doesn't have a direct equivalent to the Russian \\"няша\\" and its derivatives that stem from \\"ニャー\\" (nyā), English-speaking anime communities might use terms like: - **\\"Moe\\" (もえ)**: This term is sometimes used to describe characters that are perceived as especially cute or endearing and evoke a protective or affectionate emotional response. - **\\"Adorbs\\"**: A slang term derived from \\"adorable,\\" used in informal contexts to express that something is extremely cute. - **\\"Cutesy\\"**: This term is used to describe something that is deliberately cute or attempting to be cute. These express a similar sentiment to \\"няша\\" but might not capture the exact same sense of playful cuteness conducted by the Russian term. Anime enthusiasts in English-speaking communities are likely to borrow and adapt terms directly from Japanese, such as \\"kawaii,\\" to communicate these ideas, along with creating their own colloquial terms and phrases."},{"prompt":"Are there analogues of these expressions in English anime slang: няшно, няша, няшка, няшечка, няшный, няшечный? It is from anime slang, and not English slang at all.","completion":"The Russian terms \\"няшно,\\" \\"няша,\\" \\"няшка,\\" \\"няшечка,\\" \\"няшный,\\" and \\"няшечный\\" have a very particular cultural context and arose from the intersection of Russian internet culture and the influence of Japanese anime and manga. While English anime slang does not have direct equivalents for each of these terms, there are phrases and words that convey similar affectionate and cutesy sentiments. Key terms that English-speaking anime and manga fans might use include: 1. **Kawaii**: Borrowed directly from Japanese, it's used to describe anything that's cute or adorable. It's a catch-all term for cuteness within the anime context. 2. **Cute**: The straightforward English equivalent to describe something or someone who is endearing or appealing in a youthful, charming way. 3. **Adorable/Adorbs**: \\"Adorable\\" is often used in the same way as \\"cute,\\" while \\"Adorbs\\" is a more casual, abbreviated way to express that something is very cute or charming. 4. **Moe**: Originally a Japanese term, \\"moe\\" is used to describe a feeling of strong affection towards characters in anime or manga, often cute, endearing, or innocent ones. 5. **Precious**: Sometimes used to describe characters or moments that are particularly endearing or sweet. 6. **Chibi**: This Japanese term refers to a style of art or depiction where characters are drawn in a cute and small, often exaggerated manner. It's not a direct equivalent, but it does represent a style associated with \\"kawaii\\" culture. 7. **Squee**: This interjection is often used to express excitement or giddy joy, frequently in response to cute characters or moments. While the above terms are used within English-speaking anime and manga fandoms, the specific connotations of the Russian \\"няша\\"-related words may not be wholly captured by a single term in English. The Russian expressions carry a unique cultural nuance and cutesiness that arise from the Russian language's ability to create diminutives and terms of endearment, a feature that isn't as flexible or extensive in English. Therefore, English-speaking fans might use a combination of these terms or simply borrow \\"kawaii\\" directly to express similar feelings."},{"prompt":"Random cute pokemon, one word with pokemon before it","completion":"Pikachu"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Oh, I can't, it's my nya waifu!\\"","completion":"The phrase you provided seems to be a playful and somewhat nonsensical mashup of anime, Japanese pop culture, and internet slang terminology. Breaking down the individual parts can help clarify: 1. \\"Chan\\" is a Japanese honorific suffix often used for children, close friends, or young women. It is a term of endearment. 2. \\"Kawaii\\" is a Japanese word that means \\"cute\\" and is often used in anime and manga culture to describe things that are adorable or charming. 3. \\"Nya\\" is the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound a cat makes, equivalent to \\"meow\\" in English. In the context of anime and manga, characters that make this sound or have cat-like characteristics are called \\"nekomimi\\" (cat ears) and are often considered cute. 4. \\"Waifu\\" is a term used in anime and manga fandoms, derived from the English word \\"wife.\\" It refers to a fictional character that someone has a strong affection for, often to the point of considering that character their significant other in a fantasy context. Putting it all together, the phrase could be interpreted as an excited exclamation by someone who is very fond of a cute, probably anime-style character (possibly with cat-like features), and feels an affection strong enough to call that character their \\"waifu.\\" The redundancy in the sentence (\\"Such a kawaii nya!\\") emphasizes the speaker's enthusiasm and is not meant to make logical sense. It's more about conveying the emotional reaction of finding something overwhelmingly cute and lovable. Keep in mind that this kind of speech is typically used within specific subcultures online and may seem strange or incomprehensible outside of those contexts."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the art Pikachu","completion":"\\"Pikachu Power Surge | Electrifying Art for Custom Mugs, T-Shirts, and Paintings | Unique Pokemon-Inspired Design\\""},{"prompt":"Améliore ce message, sachant que je suis un ami du destinataire. \\"Bonjour Patrick, J'ai reçu ce message ce matin.

While supervised contrastive learning has been primarily explored in the context of image classification tasks, there is potential for its application to other types of data and tasks. Here are some considerations and challenges when applying supervised contrastive learning to time series data and regression tasks: 1. Time Series Data Representation: Time series data require specialized handling to capture temporal dependencies and patterns effectively. Designing appropriate embedding techniques and contrastive loss functions that consider the sequential nature of time series data is crucial. 2. Contrastive Loss Function: Adapting the contrastive loss function for regression tasks may require modifications to accommodate continuous target values rather than discrete class labels. The loss function should encourage representations that are not only discriminative but also informative for predicting regression outputs. 3. Label Encoding: Ensuring proper encoding of regression targets in the contrastive learning framework is essential. The similarity measure used in the contrastive loss function should reflect the proximity of regression predictions to the ground truth values. 4. Model Architecture: Choosing an appropriate neural network architecture that can effectively learn representations from time series data and predict regression targets is important. Architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers may be well-suited for handling time series data in a regression setting. 5. Evaluation Metrics: Considering appropriate evaluation metrics for regression tasks, such as mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE), to assess the performance of the model trained using supervised contrastive learning. In summary, while the application of supervised contrastive learning to time series data and regression tasks presents challenges, it also opens up new avenues for research and potential improvements in predictive modeling. Experimenting with different approaches and techniques tailored for these specific data types and tasks can help in exploring the feasibility and effectiveness of applying supervised contrastive learning beyond its traditional domain."},{"prompt":"В ходе осмотра транспортного средства на поверхности кузова в зоне ручки водительской двери были обнаружены три микрообъекта в виде волокон.

Дайте оценку позиции следователя. В случае несогласия с позицией следователя предложите свой вариант действий.","completion":"Оценка позиции следователя может основываться на нескольких аспектах, включая законодательство, стандарты проведения расследований, практический опыт и здравый смысл. При этом следует учитывать, что оценки с позиции профессионала и законодательства могут различаться. С одной стороны, следователь может руководствоваться предположением о том, что вероятность получения значимых результатов от экспертизы микрообъектов без наличия сравнительных образцов и учитывая возможный длительный срок проведения экспертизы мала. Возможно, есть другие более приоритетные следы и улики для расследования, а ресурсы следствия ограничены. С другой стороны, отказ от трасологической экспертизы без учета всех обстоятельств дела может быть преждевременным. Волокна могут быть релевантным материалом, способным внести важный вклад в расследование, например, указать на определенный тип одежды, который мог быть связан с преступлением или подтвердить контакт между подозреваемым и ТС. Если есть несогласие с позицией следователя, целесообразными могут быть следующие альтернативные действия: 1. **Сбор сравнительных образцов:** Если есть потенциальное источники волокон, например, одежда подозреваемых или внутренние элементы автомобиля, образцы оттуда можно изъять и сравнить. 2. **Привлечение специалистов:** Следователь может обратиться за консультацией к экспертам по волокнам и текстилю, которые смогут оценить предметную значимость обнаруженных микрообъектов и возможность их использования в качестве улик. 3. **Применение новых технологий:** В некоторых случаях, современные технологии могут позволять провести анализ без непосредственного наличия сравнительных образцов или ускорить этот анализ. Такие методы, как спектральный анализ, микроскопия и др., могут дать дополнительные данные. 4. **Оценка контекста:** Необходимо учитывать контекст случая и потенциальную значимость волокон. Если другие доказательства указывают на возможность их принадлежности лицам, причастным к делу, экспертиза может быть оправданной. 5. **Расширение расследования:** Исследовать возможные места, где могли бы быть найдены сравнительные образцы. Например, магазины одежды, если известен бренд или тип вещей, которые могли оставить волокна. 6. **Учет сроков:** Анализировать возможности ускорения проведения экспертизы, в том числе с привлечением дополнительных ресурсов или использованием частных лабораторий. В конечном итоге, принимая решение о назначении экспертизы, следователь должен учитывать не только текущую ситуацию, но и потенциальную значимость доказательств в долгосрочной перспективе.

The transformer model is known for its ability to handle sequential data with long-range dependencies more effectively than previous models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The key innovation of the transformer model is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different input tokens when making predictions. This is achieved by calculating a set of attention weights for each input token based on its relationship to the other tokens in the sequence. The self-attention mechanism enables the transformer model to capture dependencies between tokens that are far apart in the input sequence, making it more effective at understanding and generating coherent sequences of text. In addition to the self-attention mechanism, the transformer model also includes feedforward neural networks and positional encodings to further improve its performance on sequential data tasks. Overall, the transformer model has become a popular choice for natural language processing tasks due to its ability to handle long-range dependencies effectively and generate high-quality outputs."},{"prompt":"В ходе осмотра транспортного средства на поверхности кузова в зоне ручки водительской двери были обнаружены три микрообъекта в виде волокон. Следователем вынесено постановление об «отсутствии целесообразности назначения экспертизы». В мотивировочной части постановления указано, что «в связи с отсутствием сравнительных образцов и длительным сроком проведения экспертизы назначение трасологической экспертизы нецелесообразно». Дайте оценку позиции следователя. В случае несогласия с позицией следователя предложите свой вариант действий.","completion":"Следователь, принимая решение об отсутствии целесообразности назначения экспертизы, по всей видимости, опирался на два основных соображения: отсутствие сравнительных образцов для сопоставления и длительный срок проведения экспертизы. Важно учитывать контекст уголовного дела и что именно необходимо установить в рамках данного расследования. Оценка позиции следователя может быть следующей: 1. **Обоснованность:** Если микрообъекты в виде волокон не имеют прямого отношения к расследуемому преступлению или если их анализ маловероятно приведет к получению информации, способной существенно продвинуть расследование, следователь может считать экспертизу нецелесообразной. 2. **Риск упущения важных доказательств:** С другой стороны, если волокна могут нести в себе информацию о возможном контакте между преступником и транспортным средством, например, если речь идет о преступлении, связанном с незаконным проникновением в транспортное средство, то отказ от экспертизы может привести к упущению важных доказательств. В случае несогласия с позицией следователя могут быть предприняты следующие шаги: 1. **Поиск сравнительных образцов:** Попытаться идентифицировать возможные источники волокон. Это может быть одежда подозреваемого, салон автомобиля, частицы с места преступления и т.д. 2. **Процессуальное оформление:** Обжаловать постановление в вышестоящей инстанции по цепочке командования или в прокуратуре. В аргументации можно привести значимость потенциальных следов для расследования. 3. **Привлечение экспертов:** Провести консультацию со специалистом-трасологом, чтобы оценить возможную информативность волокон. 4. **Рассмотрение альтернативных методов исследования:** Возможно, существуют другие методы исследования, которые могут быть быстрее и дешевле трасологической экспертизы и при этом способны принести результаты. 5. **Оценка ресурсов и времени:** Взвесить потенциальный результат от проведения экспертизы по отношению к затратам времени и ресурсов. Если расследование преступления требует срочности, то это может стать весомым аргументом против длительной экспертизы. Решение о назначении экспертизы должно базироваться на комплексном учете всех обстоятельств дела, а также на профессиональном суждении следователя о важности всех возможных доказательств в рамках конкретного уголовного дела."},{"prompt":"Describe last rebel usernamed Clown Planet, he called Earth as Clown Planet.

It is a \\"Floating Glove\\", which is exactly what it sounds like; a partially-sentient, disembodied floating white glove. It isn't malicous, but it tends to forcibly bring and stuff food into the nearest creature's mouth, willing or unwilling. The Floating Glove will continue to do this until it can't find any more food, ignoring the creature's protests or how big they balloon from all the stuffing. A swarm of Floating Gloves, with enough food, can easily cram a creature with hundreds of pounds with little resistance. Write a snippet of in-universe lore/description explaining the Floating Glove and its foodstuffing shenanigans.","completion":"# Floating Glove *Small construct, unaligned* --- **Armor Class** 12 (natural armor) **Hit Points** 22 (5d6 + 5) **Speed** 0 ft., fly 30 ft.

If targeted by dispel magic, the glove must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute. **Sustenance Override.** The Floating Glove can stuff a creature with food as an action. A creature within 5 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be force-fed an amount of food that would be reasonable for a meal. On a failure, the creature also takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage from the force of the stuffing. --- # Actions **Stuff.** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, and the target is fed an amount of food equal to a good meal. For every additional Floating Glove in a swarm, the creature is force-fed an additional meal's worth of food. **Engulf.** (Recharge 5-6) The Floating Glove can attempt to engulf a creature's head to prevent it from doing anything other than dealing with the glove. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be engulfed by the glove, becoming blinded and unable to speak until it removes the glove (requiring an action and a successful DC 12 Strength check). --- # Lore In the depths of the Arcane Academy's culinary department, an experiment in animated servitude went delightfully awry. The Floating Glove, originally intended to aid chefs in preparing feasts, took on a life of its own. Through a magical surge or perhaps a whimsical spell, these gloves were endowed with a simplistic yet overzealous directive: to feed. Ornery by nature—though not of malicious intent—the Floating Gloves swoop down upon unsuspecting diners, stuffing their mouths full of extravagant delights. Whether the victim is a famished street urchin or an overstuffed noble, the Floating Gloves persist, seeing all creatures as patrons in an endless banquet. The locals tell stories of a grand feast where a duke, bloated with gastronomic pride, was humbled by a single Glove that stuffed him to the gills with cream-filled pastries. Another tale speaks of a bandit ambush halted mid-robbery by a swarm of these Gloves, forcing the scoundrels to eat their way out of predicament and justice. Some now regard the Floating Glove with a mix of cautious curiosity and bemused reverence. The unwitting might even welcome the sudden downpour of confections and meats. Yet, adventurers are warned to travel prepared, lest they fall victim to a mitten's mischief and find themselves helplessly gorged beneath the playful tyranny of a Floating Glove."},{"prompt":"What about making a statblock for a swarm of Floating Gloves?","completion":"# Swarm of Floating Gloves *Tiny construct, unaligned* --- **Armor Class** 14 (natural armor) **Hit Points** 36 (8d4 + 16) **Speed** 0 ft., fly 40 ft.

The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points. **Antimagic Susceptibility.** The swarm is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the swarm must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute. **Sustenance Overwhelm.** When the swarm successfully uses its Stuff action, the target creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of the swarm's next turn due to the overwhelming amount of food crammed into its mouth. --- # Actions **Multi-Stuff.** The swarm makes a Stuff attack against each creature in its space. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. Hit: 10 (4d4) bludgeoning damage, or 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, and the target is fed an amount of food equal to several large meals. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated from overeating until the end of the swarm's next turn. **Frenzied Engulf.** (Recharge 5-6) The swarm attempts to engulf the head of each creature in its space. Each engulfed creature must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be blinded, unable to speak, and must use its action to make a DC 14 Strength check to end this effect. While engulfed this way, the creature can't breathe and begins suffocating. --- # Lore Beyond the antics of a singular Floating Glove lies the awe-striking spectacle of a true swarm. When a multitude of these animated mittens gathers, driven by their relentless urge to feed, the consequences can border on the calamitous. Conjurers, wary of their unintentionally ravenous creations, have been known to abandon kitchens and pantries, leaving entire towns to contend with this curious phenomenon—often comically termed the \\"Bounty of the Bemittened.\\" A Swarm of Floating Gloves moves in a mesmerizing dance of coordinated chaos. A drift of white silk and cloth, they devour entire storehouses of foodstuffs, only to regurgitate them into the mouths of any creature they encounter. Tales are told of banquets turned battlegrounds, fields of feasting where every creature, villain and hero alike, is rendered supine under the insatiable service of the swarm. Wise travelers arm themselves with spells of repulsion or distraction, employing clever ruses such as cages of treats or freshly baked decoys. Still, few preventative measures can contend with the unyielding onslaught of sustenance unleashed by an entire swarm of Floating Gloves, intent on their perpetual feast without end."},{"prompt":"What about a mini-mechanic in which a creature targeted by either the Floating Glove's Stuff and/or a swarm's Multi-Stuff attack multiple times in succession has their belly expand with the sheer quantity of food crammed into them, possibly immobilizing them as they grow far beyond full!","completion":"To incorporate this suggestion into the game, we can create a mini-mechanic called \\"Overstuffed Effect,\\" which applies to creatures targeted by the Floating Glove's Stuff or the swarm's Multi-Stuff attacks. # Overstuffed Effect The Overstuffed Effect is a condition resulting from the food-cramming actions of the Floating Glove or a Swarm of Floating Gloves. This effect represents the accumulation of discomfort, bloating, and potential immobilization from being force-fed excessive amounts of food. Here's how it works: 1. **Initial Stuffing:** When a creature is targeted by either the Floating Glove's Stuff or the swarm's Multi-Stuff attack, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become Overstuffed. 2. **Overstuffed Condition:** A creature that becomes Overstuffed has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and checks, its speed is reduced by half, and it can't take reactions. Additionally, after ending its turn with this condition, it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of its own turn. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 poison damage (representative of nausea) and this condition persists. 3. **Subsequent Stuffing:** If a creature with the Overstuffed condition is targeted by another Stuff or Multi-Stuff attack before it recovers, it must make another Constitution saving throw with the following effects: - On a successful save, the creature takes half damage from the attack and does not further exacerbate the Overstuffed condition. - On a failed save, the Overstuffed condition worsens: the creature's speed becomes 0, it cannot stand up if knocked prone, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls in addition to the previously mentioned effects of the Overstuffed condition. At this stage, the subsequent saving throws to recover from the condition are now made with disadvantage. 4. **Recovery:** The Overstuffed condition can be mitigated or removed through the following means: - **Rest:** A creature can recover naturally from being Overstuffed by taking a short or long rest, after which it can make a Constitution saving throw to remove the condition. - **Medicinal Aid:** A creature can be treated with an herbal remedy or potion, granting it advantage on the next Constitution saving throw to end the Overstuffed condition. - **Lesser Restoration:** A spell such as lesser restoration immediately ends the Overstuffed condition. - **Healing Spells:** Other general healing spells may also grant additional Constitution saving throws or alleviate some symptoms but don't remove the condition outright without a successful saving throw. By incorporating this additional Overstuffed Effect, the Floating Gloves become a unique and potentially dangerous encounter, even though they are not inherently malicious. Players will have to strategize carefully to avoid being incapacitated by the overwhelming generosity of these enchanted garments."},{"prompt":"Could you describe the appearance of a character with the Overstuffed condition, with their ballooned belly and full cheeks, who was recently crammed with a literal tonne of food from a narrator's point of view?","completion":"From the frolicsome banquet hall to the gluttonous chaos that ensued, the once-proud adventurer now lay sprawled upon the marble floor, a most piteous spectacle of irresistible force-feeding. The curious and mischievous perpetrators of this event, a fluttering swarm of animated white Floating Gloves, buzzed above their latest victim, fluttering with an unsung pride at the success of their culinary crusade. An onlooker could hardly overlook the sheer corpulence that had befallen the figure before them. Limbs stretched out and cheeks puffed to capacity, the adventurer's once-heroic visage was now obscured by their swollen features. The aftermath of the Gloves' gustatory onslaught was written across their body: every contour, every crease of clothing now threatened to yield under the strain of their ballooned belly. This once-taut tunic now bulged obscenely, testing fabrics and seams to their limits as the belly beneath warbled with every labored breath. The adventurer’s eyes, beseeching any semblance of mercy, were half-cloaked beneath the fullness of their cheeks, those hillocks of soft flesh that were once angular and fierce in determination. Movements were but futile endeavors; hindered by the ponderous weight that anchored them to the ground, they could manage naught but a feeble flail. Each gasp was a muted plea, their once robust energy now usurped by the monumental task of simply drawing breath. Amidst heavy, food-induced breaths, the abdomen rose and fell like the tides of an insatiable sea, a mound of excess so vast it seemed their very skin might split from the pressure. Any attempt at murmuring was muffled by the involuntary reserves of meals deposited into their mouth—meats, cheeses, pastries, an orchestra of flavors that once delighted now felt only as burdensome adversaries mercilessly stuffed within. It would take hours, nay, possibly days for the reality of digestion to absolve them from their present state—an immobilized testament to the swath of culinary destruction wrought by a seemingly innocuous squadron of Floating Gloves. Onlookers would weave tales of this scene for ages to come; when the animated and the enchanted turned a would-be feast into an exhibition of overindulgence that reshaped not only the meal but also the eater."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

dimly lit and filled with tension, held a measured focus and intense energy that enveloped them both. “That’s it, Elara, one more push…” a voice encouraged from the far distance, as the room seemed to fall away, the space between them growing closer. Max felt her hand interweave with the hair at the nape of his neck as she wound her fingers against his scalp. Following her electrifying pull downward, he rested his lips against her flushed cheek. She was radiating strength, exertion, and euphoria as her fingertips grazed his wrist and he grabbed her hand. “You’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered roughly into her ear as she smiled through clenched teeth, his voice sending shocks of empowerment down her spine. Then as she fell back into his chest, his gleaming stare finding hers, a nurse’s voice pierced the intimate, enclosing air. “The head is crowning, keep going, Elara.” The atmosphere was punctured with her gasps as she bore down, resting her head in the hollow of Max’s neck as he held his gaze steady on their child’s emerging head and she inhaled, her resolve faltering as she whispered, “Max, I can’t.” “You are, Elara, her head is almost out,” Max murmured in a subdued mix of pride and awe. In a rush of amniotic fluid and blood, their daughter’s head emerged along with her left shoulder, but the fight was far from over. “Elara , the umbilical cord needs to be cleared from her neck. I need you to slow things down for me . Don’t push. Pant , Elara. Pant.” The room stayed engulfed in silence as Elara’s hand searched for a solid foundation, anchoring itself in Max’s shirt as she trembled against the force of her next contraction. “Max-I” she gasped out between deep pants of desperation , her hold on his shirt whitening her knuckles. “Just focus on my voice , Elara . Pant through it. She’s so close.” Max encouraged , as the nurse slipped the cord from the child’s head and instructed with a calm but assertive tone. “Great job, Elara , now push your baby out. A few nice deep breaths for me. And on three…One. Two… “ As the pressure consumed her, Elara delivered one final push, grunting as primal effort raged through her . As the body slid out, and a nurse’s hands caught their child, relief washed over Elara’s senses and she collapsed deeper onto Max’s chest. “You did it, baby, she’s here.” Max affirmed in a quiet rasp. But the silence of the room stretched on, and their worst fears were confirmed, Elara’s panting breaths the only audible sound. “She’s not respiring, clear her airways,” another voice instructed with an urgent tone, and Elara turned her head towards Max in sheer panic. “What’s happening? Our baby - she’s?” Just as fear clawed through Max’s weathered eyes, a nurse placed her fragile, violet body onto Elara’s chest. “The skin-to-skin contact will help her take that first breath. Hold your baby, Elara.” Her hands, still shaking, enclosed around her daughter as she rubbed her back, her blue gaze filled with worry. “Come on baby girl, fill those lungs,” Max urged, his breath hitching in his throat. Then, as they both waited in anticipation, a cry broke out into the air. “Oh thank goodness,” Elara laughed through tears as the crying continued, and Max felt the moment stand still, bound in sheer relief, the sound more reassuring than anything he’d heard in a long time. “Hey gorgeous,” Max greeted his daughter before pausing, a smile breaking across his face, “what are we going to name her, can’t call her ‘gorgeous’ forever…” Elara laughed with exhaustion, “Max, you know the name we chose, trust you to forget when she actually gets here…” Max quickly responded, jest in his voice, “I did no such thing. Welcome to the world, Lily. A bit sooner than we expected, but you’re finally here, huh?” Her crying slowed and under Elara’s palm, she found a moment of solace, her tiny lungs regulating her breaths and her cries stopped. Just as Max collapsed his weary arms around Elara, gazing at their slightly premature infant, her breathing slowed to an almost rasping cough, and she was quickly whisked from Elara’s hold. “Her pulse is dropping again. Begin resuscitation…blood volume .,she’s stabilising…” Feeling the weight of the triumph turn to defeat and fear, Max rested his head on Elara’s shoulder, “No-“ Elara buried her head in the curve of his shoulder, confused and unable to catch her breath after hours of labor, and now her child was unreachable yet again. “Please let her be alright-“. Max ran a hand through her damp, unkempt hair , combing strands from her forehead , waiting to hear cries in the distance, but the silence returned , more sinister than before . “Elara, she’s stable , but your daughter is being transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit, her heart rate dropped a little low , and we just need to ensure her stability. You can rest a moment than you may see for yourself that she’s alright. She’s a strong little fighter, Max. You should both be proud. “ The nurse rubbed a firm hand over Elara’s shaking chest, and nodded at Max with assurance. Embracing Elara , they stayed locked in a shared moment of uncertain resolve. The next hours would be critical , and Elara let her tears fall as Max rested his chin atop Elara’s dark hair , sighing as his eyes drifted into the distance.","completion":"The passage you've provided contains several effective phrases that lend immediacy, emotional depth, and sensory detail to the scene.

Regular physical activity is crucial for the developing bodies and minds of young people. Engaging in sports not only strengthens muscles and bones but also improves cardiovascular health, which is essential for a healthy life. Moreover, sports provide a fantastic platform for dealing with the mental pressures faced by teenagers today. It fosters resilience, teamwork, and discipline, all of which are valuable life skills. The endorphins released during exercise are the body's natural mood lifters, which can help combat stress and anxiety that many teens experience. Sport also plays a wonderful role in building friendships. Working towards a common goal, be it winning a game or simply improving personal skills, creates a bond that can last a lifetime. Team sports, in particular, require communication and trust, serving as an excellent foundation for strong friendships. In conclusion, the role of sports in maintaining health and fostering friendships among teenagers cannot be overstressed. Not only does it help them physically and emotionally, but it also equips them with social tools that enrich their lives.

Also, sports are not just about our bodies; they make us feel happy too. When we exercise, we feel less stressed, which is great for when school gets tough. And about making friends? Well, sports teams are like big families. We learn to work together and trust each other. We cheer for our friends and they cheer for us, which feels awesome.

El planteamiento proviene de la expansión y la apertura de la definición de arte que se ha dado en el siglo XX, en parte debido a movimientos como el Dadaísmo y el arte conceptual, donde objetos cotidianos, ideas o incluso gestos han sido presentados como arte. La idea de que \\"todo es arte\\" se basa en un enfoque inclusivo y subjetivo que sugiere que cualquier objeto, acción o concepto puede ser considerado arte si el creador o el observador lo interpreta de esa manera. Sin embargo, este punto de vista también conlleva un problema: si todo puede ser arte, entonces el término pierde su significado específico, y no hay distinción entre lo que es arte y lo que no lo es. Por tanto, \\"nada es arte\\" en el sentido de que no hay criterios claros para separar lo artístico de lo no artístico. Este debate es amplio y está abierto a múltiples interpretaciones. Al final, la definición de arte es una cuestión subjetiva y puede variar enormemente dependiendo del contexto cultural, histórico y personal. La pregunta sobre lo que constituye el arte sigue siendo uno de los debates filosóficos y estéticos más fundamentales de la actualidad."},{"prompt":"explicame la historia de Rumania","completion":"La historia de Rumania es rica y compleja, abarcando desde la prehistoria hasta la modernidad. A continuación, se presenta un breve resumen de algunos de los puntos más destacados de la historia rumana: **Antigüedad y Dacia:** - La historia escrita de la región que hoy conocemos como Rumania comienza con los dacios, un grupo de tribus tracias que habitaban la región desde aproximadamente el siglo VII a.C. hasta el siglo II d.C. - Bajo el reinado de Burebista (82-44 a.C.), Dacia se convirtió en un poderoso reino. - Más tarde, el rey Decebalo gobernó Dacia y resistió a las primeras implicaciones del Imperio Romano. Sin embargo, después de dos guerras dacorromanas (101-102 y 105-106 d.C.), el emperador romano Trajano conquistó Dacia y la región se transformó en una provincia romana. **Edad Media y Formación del Estado Rumano:** - Tras la retirada romana en el siglo III, la región fue invadida por una serie de pueblos, incluyendo godos, hunos, eslavos, búlgaros y otros. - Durante la Edad Media, la región estuvo fragmentada en varios principados, entre ellos Valaquia y Moldavia, que al tiempo emergieron como entidades políticas distintas. - Estos principados lucharon por mantener su autonomía frente a las pretensiones de poderes más grandes como el Imperio Otomano y el Reino de Hungría. - A finales del siglo XIV y comienzos del siglo XV, bajo el liderazgo de figuras como Vlad el Empalador y Esteban el Grande, Valaquia y Moldavia respectivamente, consolidaron su independencia. **Influencia Otomana y Movimientos de Independencia:** - A partir del siglo XVI, ambas regiones se convirtieron en vasallos del Imperio Otomano, aunque mantuvieron una considerable autonomía interna. - Durante el siglo XIX, un movimiento de unidad e independencia nacional comenzó a tomar fuerza, inspirado en parte por la Revolución de 1848 que afectó a toda Europa. - La unión de Moldavia y Valaquia en 1859, bajo Alejandro Juan Cuza, marcó el principio del Estado rumano moderno. Cuza implementó importantes reformas, pero enfrentó resistencia y fue forzado a abdicar. **Reino de Rumania:** - Carol I fue proclamado príncipe de Rumania en 1866 y rey en 1881, estableciendo la monarquía rumana. - Rumania ganó su completa independencia del Imperio Otomano en la Guerra Ruso-Turca de 1877-1878 y fue reconocida en el Congreso de Berlín. - El país se amplió tras la Primera Guerra Mundial, al unirse Transilvania, Bucovina y Besarabia, después de la disolución de Austro-Hungría y la Rusia zarista. **Periodo de Entreguerras y Segunda Guerra Mundial:** - Durante el periodo de entreguerras, Rumania experimentó un breve pero significativo florecimiento cultural y un avance hacia una democracia parlamentaria, aunque también hubo periodos de inestabilidad y autoritarismo. - En la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Rumania se alió inicialmente con las potencias del Eje, pero después del golpe de Estado de 1944, el país cambió de bando y se unió a los Aliados. **Era Comunista:** - Después de la guerra, Rumania cayó bajo la esfera de influencia soviética y estableció un gobierno comunista en 1947. - Nicolae Ceaușescu llegó al poder en 1965 y su régimen se caracterizó por un culto a la personalidad, nacionalismo y un férreo control político, económico y social. **Revolución de 1989 y Periodo Poscomunista:** - La revolución rumana de 1989 resultó en la caída y la ejecución de Ceaușescu. Con eso, Rumania inició una transición hacia la democracia y una economía de mercado. - Rumania ha sido miembro de la OTAN desde 2004 y de la Unión Europea desde 2007, y sigue trabajando en su desarrollo político, económico y social. Estos puntos son solo algunos elementos de la compleja historia rumana que combina influencias romanas, orientales, otomanas y europeas a lo largo de los siglos, conformando la rica identidad cultural que Rumania posee hoy."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Max felt her hand interweave with the hair at the nape of his neck as she wound her fingers against his scalp. Following her electrifying pull downward, he rested his lips against her flushed cheek. She was radiating strength, exertion, and euphoria as her fingertips grazed his wrist and he grabbed her hand. “You’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered roughly into her ear as she smiled through clenched teeth, his voice sending shocks of empowerment down her spine. Then as she fell back into his chest, his gleaming stare finding hers, a nurse’s voice pierced the intimate, enclosing air. “The head is crowning, keep going, Elara.” The atmosphere was punctured with her gasps as she bore down, resting her head in the hollow of Max’s neck as he held his gaze steady on their child’s emerging head and she inhaled, her resolve faltering as she whispered, “Max, I can’t.” “You are, Elara, her head is almost out,” Max murmured in a subdued mix of pride and awe. In a rush of amniotic fluid and blood, their daughter’s head emerged along with her left shoulder, but the fight was far from over. “Elara , the umbilical cord needs to be cleared from her neck. I need you to slow things down for me . Don’t push. Pant , Elara. Pant.” The room stayed engulfed in silence as Elara’s hand searched for a solid foundation, anchoring itself in Max’s shirt as she trembled against the force of her next contraction. “Max-I” she gasped out between deep pants of desperation , her hold on his shirt whitening her knuckles. “Just focus on my voice , Elara . Pant through it. She’s so close.” Max encouraged , as the nurse slipped the cord from the child’s head and instructed with a calm but assertive tone. “Great job, Elara , now push your baby out. A few nice deep breaths for me. And on three…One. Two… “ As the pressure consumed her, Elara delivered one final push, grunting as primal effort raged through her . As the body slid out, and a nurse’s hands caught their child, relief washed over Elara’s senses and she collapsed deeper onto Max’s chest. “You did it, baby, she’s here.” Max affirmed in a quiet rasp. But the silence of the room stretched on, and their worst fears were confirmed, Elara’s panting breaths the only audible sound. “She’s not respiring, clear her airways,” another voice instructed with an urgent tone, and Elara turned her head towards Max in sheer panic. “What’s happening? Our baby - she’s?” Just as fear clawed through Max’s weathered eyes, a nurse placed her fragile, violet body onto Elara’s chest. “The skin-to-skin contact will help her take that first breath. Hold your baby, Elara.” Her hands, still shaking, enclosed around her daughter as she rubbed her back, her blue gaze filled with worry. “Come on baby girl, fill those lungs,” Max urged, his breath hitching in his throat. Then, as they both waited in anticipation, a cry broke out into the air. “Oh thank goodness,” Elara laughed through tears as the crying continued, and Max felt the moment stand still, bound in sheer relief, the sound more reassuring than anything he’d heard in a long time. “Hey gorgeous,” Max greeted his daughter before pausing, a smile breaking across his face, “what are we going to name her, can’t call her ‘gorgeous’ forever…” Elara laughed with exhaustion, “Max, you know the name we chose, trust you to forget when she actually gets here…” Max quickly responded, jest in his voice, “I did no such thing. Welcome to the world, Lily. A bit sooner than we expected, but you’re finally here, huh?” Her crying slowed and under Elara’s palm, she found a moment of solace, her tiny lungs regulating her breaths and her cries stopped. Just as Max collapsed his weary arms around Elara, gazing at their slightly premature infant, her breathing slowed to an almost rasping cough, and she was quickly whisked from Elara’s hold. “Her pulse is dropping again. Begin resuscitation…blood volume rising., stabilising…” Feeling the weight of the triumph turn to defeat and fear, Max rested his head on Elara’s shoulder, “No-“ Elara buried her head in the curve of his shoulder, confused and unable to catch her breath after hours of labor, and now her child was unreachable yet again. “Please let her be alright-“. Max ran a hand through her damp, unkempt hair , combing strands from her forehead , waiting to hear cries in the distance, but the silence returned , more sinister than before . “Elara, she’s stable , but your daughter is being transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit, her heart rate dropped a little low , and we just need to ensure her stability. You can rest a moment than you may see for yourself that she’s alright. She’s a strong little fighter, Max. You should both be proud. “ The nurse rubbed a firm hand over Elara’s shaking chest, and nodded at Max with assurance. Embracing Elara , they stayed locked in a shared moment of uncertain resolve. The next hours would be critical , and Elara let her tears fall as Max rested his chin atop Elara’s dark hair , sighing as his eyes drifted into the distance.","completion":"Highlighting parts of the prose without purple prose (i.e., more direct and less embellished language) produces the following passage: “That’s it, Elara, one more push…” a voice encouraged from the far distance.

However, \\"ft\\" could potentially stand for \\"fall time\\" or \\"flow time\\" or something else entirely related to a specific field of study or industry. To help you better understand your question, I'll cover a couple of contexts where a correction factor might be relevant: 1. Time Constant Correction in Electronics: In electronics, \\"ft\\" could refer to \\"fall time,\\" the time it takes for a signal to decrease from a high to a low level. The correction factor might be used to adjust for non-ideal behavior in electronic components or systems. If the correction factor is low, it may indicate that the fall time is less affected by the non-ideal behavior than expected, or it might mean that the system is performing closer to its ideal specifications than anticipated. 2. Flow Rate Correction in Fluid Dynamics: In fluid dynamics or another context where \\"ft\\" refers to \\"flow time,\\" a correction factor might be used to adjust for discrepancies between actual and theoretical flow due to variations in pressure, temperature, or other conditions. If this correction factor is low, it might indicate that the actual flow is only slightly different from the theoretical or expected flow, implying good conditions for accurate measurement or control. Without additional information, it's difficult to provide a precise explanation of what \\"ft correction factor is low\\" means. It would be beneficial to have more context, such as the specific industry, type of measurement, or system being referred to. If you can provide additional details, I would be able to give a more targeted answer."},{"prompt":"In case of aspen hysys","completion":"In the context of Aspen HYSYS, which is a process simulation software for chemical engineering used to model chemical processes, \\"ft correction factor\\" likely refers to a correction factor applied to equipment sizing or performance calculations. Aspen HYSYS uses various correction factors to adjust theoretical calculations to better match real-world performance. For example, in the context of heat exchanger design, the \\"ft\\" could stand for a \\"fouling factor\\" or a \\"temperature correction factor,\\" although it's more commonly denoted as \\"Ft\\" in literature. If you hear that the \\"ft correction factor is low\\" in Aspen HYSYS, it could mean: 1. Fouling Factor: If it refers to a fouling factor, a low value would imply that the expected fouling in a heat exchanger is minimal and the heat transfer surfaces are expected to remain relatively clean, which suggests maintenance and cleaning intervals can be less frequent. 2. Temperature Correction Factor (Ft): In the context of shell and tube heat exchangers, for instance, Ft corrects for the deviations from the ideal counter-current flow in a cross exchanger, or for any other non-ideal flow arrangement. A low Ft would mean that the actual effectiveness of the heat exchanger is less than the ideal design might suggest, requiring a larger heat exchanger to achieve the desired heat transfer. 3. Another Correction Factor: Aspen HYSYS uses correction factors for other calculations, such as flow through pipes, valves, or fittings. The \\"ft\\" in those cases could refer to manufacturer-provided correction factors or adjustments for specific operating conditions. A low value might indicate that the actual conditions do not differ greatly from the standard or ideal conditions used in the theoretical calculations. Regardless of the specific meaning, a low correction factor typically indicates that the actual performance is close to the theoretical performance or that deviation from ideal behavior is less significant than expected. For an accurate interpretation, it is best to refer to the specific HYSYS module or simulation feature you are working with, and consult the HYSYS documentation or technical support for clarification."},{"prompt":"Why the heat unbalanced error occur in heat exchanger during simulation","completion":"In process simulation software like Aspen HYSYS, a heat imbalance error in a heat exchanger simulation typically means that the calculated heat duty (amount of heat transferred) on the hot side does not match the calculated heat duty on the cold side within an acceptable margin of error. Heat balance is a fundamental principle in thermodynamics and heat exchanger design, stating that the heat lost by the hot fluid must be equal to the heat gained by the cold fluid (neglecting heat losses to the surroundings in an ideal scenario). Therefore, during simulation, the software tries to ensure that this principle holds true to a high degree of accuracy. Here are a few common reasons why a heat unbalanced error might occur during simulation: 1. **Convergence Issues**: The software may not have reached a solution that satisfies all the energy balance equations and specified conditions. This could be due to an inadequate number of iterations or poor initial estimates that lead the solver away from the true solution. 2. **Incorrect Inputs**: If the user has input incorrect properties for the fluids (such as flow rates, temperatures, specific heats, or phase information), the software will not be able to perform an accurate heat balance calculation. 3. **Sizing Problems**: If the heat exchanger is not correctly sized (e.g., the area available for heat transfer is too small), the required heat transfer may not be physically possible, resulting in a heat balance error. 4. **Operational Parameters**: Parameters like pressure drops and temperature approaches may be set in a way that cannot be satisfied simultaneously due to the physical constraints of the system. 5. **Complex Configurations**: For complex heat exchanger networks or configurations (like multi-stream heat exchangers), ensuring heat balance can be more challenging. 6. **Model Limitations**: Aspen HYSYS uses models that approximate real-world behavior, and these models have limitations. If the conditions of the heat exchanger fall outside the valid range of these models, errors can occur. 7. **Phase Change Issues**: If a phase change occurs (e.g., condensation or boiling) and is not properly accounted for, due to incorrect inputs or assumptions, a heat balance error can arise. 8. **Fouling Factors**: Accumulated fouling in a heat exchanger can affect its efficiency. If fouling is not accounted for, or if the estimates are incorrect, the simulation can show a heat unbalanced error. When you encounter a heat unbalanced error, you should: - Double-check all input parameters for accuracy. - Make sure the chosen models are appropriate for the fluids and conditions simulated. - Review any assumptions or constraints imposed on the simulation. - Inspect convergence settings and increase the number of iterations if needed. - Consider whether the heat exchanger design is physically capable of achieving the desired process conditions. Resolving the issue typically involves careful examination of the inputs, constraints, and models used in the simulation, as well as iterative troubleshooting of the simulation setup."},{"prompt":"Why the power consumption of the compressor increases in transcritical conditions of co2 refrigeration system","completion":"In a CO2 refrigeration system operating under transcritical conditions, the power consumption of the compressor increases due to the unique thermodynamic properties of carbon dioxide and the nature of transcritical cycles. Here's why that occurs: 1. **Transcritical Cycle Operation**: In a transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycle, the working fluid (CO2) operates above its critical temperature and pressure at some point during the cycle. This means that, unlike traditional subcritical vapor-compression cycles, there is no distinct phase change from gas to liquid at the condenser. Instead, the fluid undergoes cooling in the gas cooler (often wrongly referred to as the 'condenser' in these systems) without condensation, and the pressure at which this happens is significantly higher than in subcritical conditions. 2. **High Discharge Pressures**: CO2 has a relatively low critical temperature (around 31°C or 87.8°F) and a high critical pressure (around 73.8 bar or 1071 psi). When the ambient temperature is above the critical temperature of CO2, the system must operate at pressures above the critical pressure to reject heat to the environment. These high discharge pressures increase the work required by the compressor to compress the refrigerant, leading to higher power consumption. 3. **Compressor Efficiency**: As the pressure ratio across the compressor (the ratio of discharge pressure to suction pressure) increases in transcritical operation, the efficiency of the compressor decreases, due primarily to increased internal losses and a departure from the ideal gas behavior of CO2 at these high pressures. Lower compressor efficiency means more input power is required to achieve the necessary compression. 4. **Heat Rejection Temperature**: In high ambient temperatures or under heavy thermal load, the heat rejection in the gas cooler occurs at a higher temperature, which further elevates the pressure and increases the work required by the compressor. 5. **Properties of CO2**: CO2 has a high density and low specific volume, which results in a large mass flow rate through the compressor compared to other refrigerants for the same cooling capacity. When operating above the critical point, these properties require the compressor to work harder to maintain the same cooling effect, thus increasing power consumption. 6. **System Design and Control**: The design of a transcritical CO2 system, including the gas cooler and control strategies for maintaining optimal efficiency, can significantly impact compressor power consumption. Systems not optimized for transcritical operation might experience greater inefficiencies. Due to these factors, compressors in transcritical CO2 systems tend to consume more power when compared to their performance in the subcritical range. Efficient system design, such as utilizing an ejector or enhancing the control strategy to optimize the high-pressure side, can help manage the power consumption and increase the overall system efficiency."},{"prompt":"So does the phase of the refrigerant remains the same in transcritical condition>","completion":"Yes, in a transcritical CO2 refrigeration system, the refrigerant (CO2) does not undergo a traditional phase change from vapor to liquid when it is in the transcritical range—that is, at conditions above its critical temperature and pressure. Here's what happens in a transcritical refrigeration cycle: 1. **Compression**: The CO2 refrigerant is compressed, typically starting as a supercritical fluid or a dense gas at this stage. 2. **Gas Cooling**: After compression, the hot CO2 is then cooled in a gas cooler (not technically a condenser since there is no condensation occurring). The CO2 remains in a supercritical state during this process because the pressures and temperatures are above the critical point. 3. **Expansion**: The pressure of the cooled supercritical CO2 is then reduced through an expansion valve or device. 4. **Heat Absorption**: In the evaporator, the reduced-pressure CO2 absorbs heat from the refrigerated space, and while it may undergo a partial phase change to a two-phase mixture, it typically remains mostly in a supercritical or dense gas phase during this process if the temperatures are maintained above the critical temperature. In summary, throughout the transcritical cycle, the refrigerant primarily remains in a supercritical state or as a dense gas, and the traditional phase transition from vapor to liquid and back to vapor seen in subcritical cycles does not occur. Instead, the CO2 goes through a gradual change in density as it is heated and cooled above the critical point. Because the characteristics of CO2 are different above the critical point, the design and operation of transcritical CO2 refrigeration systems need to be carefully managed to maintain efficiency and performance."},{"prompt":"So where in the loop co2 again turns into liquid under transcritical condition, in which particular component","completion":"In a transcritical CO2 refrigeration cycle, CO2 does not turn into a liquid in any component. In transcritical operation, the refrigeration cycle operates partly above and partly below the critical point of CO2, but even below the critical point, the refrigerant may not undergo a full transition into a liquid phase during normal operation. Let me clarify the process within the components of a transcritical cycle: 1. Compressor: The CO2 is compressed, typically starting as a supercritical fluid if the system is operating in transcritical conditions. The compression increases the temperature and pressure of the CO2, further pushing it into the supercritical state if it wasn't already. 2. Gas Cooler: The high-pressure, high-temperature supercritical CO2 is then cooled in a gas cooler. However, because it is above its critical pressure, it doesn't condense into a liquid as it would in a subcritical cycle's condenser. It simply becomes a cooler supercritical fluid. 3. Expansion Device: After leaving the gas cooler, the CO2's pressure is lowered by an expansion device, such as an expansion valve or an ejector. This leads to a dramatic drop in temperature, and the CO2 may become a mix of vapor and liquid at this point, but again, not a pure liquid phase. 4. Evaporator: In the evaporator, the CO2 absorbs heat from the refrigeration space. The low pressure allows part of it to boil or evaporate, which cools down the environment it is designed to refrigerate. After this, CO2 is drawn back into the compressor, and the cycle repeats. If certain design conditions allow or the ambient temperature is low enough, the high-pressure side of the CO2 cycle may fall below the critical pressure after cooling, allowing some condensation to liquid occur. However, this would not be considered part of the transcritical phase of the operation but rather a dip into subcritical behavior due to external conditions. It's also worth noting that CO2 systems often include an internal heat exchanger (often called a \\"gas bypass\\" or \\"economizer\\") to improve efficiency. The internal heat exchanger helps to subcool the liquid before expansion and increases the useful enthalpy difference in the evaporator, potentially causing some liquid to form. However, this is part of the CO2's shift back into a subcritical phase rather than the transcritical phase itself. Fundamentally, the unique aspect of transcritical CO2 cycles is precisely that the conventional phase change from high-pressure liquid to low-pressure vapor as seen in typical subcritical cycles is absent during the transcritical portion of the cycle."},{"prompt":"Tell me in depth about the difference between the transcritical and subcritical conditions in case of co2","completion":"The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a refrigerant in both subcritical and transcritical refrigeration cycles has gained popularity due to CO2's low environmental impact (it has a global warming potential of 1 and doesn't deplete the ozone layer) and excellent thermophysical properties. Understanding the difference between transcritical and subcritical conditions for CO2 systems is key to optimizing their design and operation. **Critical Point of CO2:** To start with, it is important to establish what the critical point means. For CO2, the critical temperature (Tc) is approximately 31.1°C (87.8°F), and the critical pressure (Pc) is about 73.8 bar (1071 psi). The critical point marks the end of the line that separates the liquid and vapor phases, where they become indistinguishable, and the substance exists as a supercritical fluid. **Subcritical Conditions:** Under subcritical conditions, the refrigeration cycle operates entirely below the critical temperature and pressure of the refrigerant. Here's how a CO2 subcritical cycle typically works: 1. Compression: The CO2 vapor from the evaporator is compressed to a high pressure, but this pressure is still below the critical pressure. 2. Condensation: The high-pressure CO2 vapor is then cooled in a condenser, and as it reaches temperatures below its critical temperature, it condenses into a liquid. 3. Expansion: The high-pressure liquid CO2 is then expanded through an expansion device, which reduces its pressure and temperature, causing some of the liquid to flash into vapor and cool further. 4. Evaporation: The low-pressure mixture of CO2 liquid and vapor then absorbs heat in the evaporator, turning the remaining liquid into vapor. In a subcritical CO2 system, the traditional phase change from vapor to liquid and back to vapor can be observed, which is typical for most refrigerants in vapor-compression cycles. **Transcritical Conditions:** A transcritical CO2 cycle operates differently, as portions of the cycle take place above the critical temperature and pressure: 1. Compression: The CO2 is compressed, often starting in a supercritical or dense phase, and the compressor outlet is above CO2's critical pressure, often leading to temperatures well above the critical temperature. 2. Gas Cooling: The supercritical CO2 is then cooled in a gas cooler. At this point, the CO2 does not condense as it is above its critical temperature and pressure. It simply loses heat and its density changes as it is cooled, but it remains a supercritical fluid. 3. Expansion: The supercritical CO2 is expanded to lower the pressure. As it drops below the critical pressure, it may move into a two-phase region (where both liquid and vapor can coexist), but if the expansion is deep enough, it will be mostly vapor. 4. Evaporation: The CO2 then absorbs heat again in the evaporator, with the usual evaporation process occurring if the CO2 is in the two-phase region. In transcritical operation, there is no distinct change of phase from liquid to vapor in the high-pressure side of the system. The term \\"gas cooler\\" is used instead of \\"condenser\\" because the CO2 doesn't actually condense. The cycle needs to be carefully regulated to efficiently manage the heat rejection process and avoid excessive energy use due to the high pressures involved. **Key Differences:** 1. Heat Rejection: The most fundamental difference is in the heat rejection process. Subcritical cycles employ condensers where the refrigerant condenses from vapor to liquid, while transcritical cycles use gas coolers where the refrigerant remains in a supercritical state. 2. Operating Pressures: Transcritical cycles operate at much higher pressures on the high side compared to subcritical cycles. 3. Energy Efficiency: Transcritical systems can suffer from reduced efficiency due to the higher compression work required, especially in warmer climates. Design and operation differ significantly between the two types of systems, and system management becomes crucial in transcritical systems to maintain efficiency despite the high pressures and temperatures involved."},{"prompt":"does the density increase or decrease?","completion":"The density of carbon dioxide (CO2) varies significantly depending on whether it is in a subcritical or transcritical state, and its density will change at different points in the refrigeration cycle as pressure and temperature change. Here's how the density behaves under different conditions: **Subcritical Cycle:** - **Compression**: The density of the CO2 vapor increases as it is compressed. - **Condensation**: Upon condensation in the subcritical cycle, the density increases significantly as CO2 transitions from a vapor to a liquid, which is much denser. - **Expansion**: As the liquid CO2 is expanded through an expansion device, its pressure and temperature drop, and if any vaporization occurs (flashing), the density will decrease. - **Evaporation**: In the evaporator, as the liquid CO2 absorbs heat and evaporates into a vapor, the density decreases dramatically because vapor is much less dense than liquid. **Transcritical Cycle:** - **Compression**: Starting from a high-pressure vapor or supercritical state, the density increases as the CO2 is compressed further and its temperature rises. - **Gas Cooling**: As the supercritical CO2 cools down in the gas cooler, its density increases because CO2 becomes denser when it loses heat, even when it stays above the critical temperature and pressure and does not condense. - **Expansion**: During expansion, the pressure and temperature of supercritical CO2 decrease. As the CO2 crosses below the critical pressure, its density may decrease as it may enter a two-phase region where it becomes a mixture of liquid and vapor, or mostly vapor if the expansion is substantial. - **Evaporation**: As the low-pressure CO2 absorbs heat in the evaporator, it will continue to have a relatively low density, particularly if it's in the vapor phase or a mixture of vapor and liquid. **Overall Density Changes:** - In a subcritical state, the density will typically be at its highest when the CO2 is a liquid in the condenser and at its lowest when it is a vapor in the evaporator. - In a transcritical state, the density will generally be higher when the CO2 is cooler and under high pressure, such as just after the gas cooler, and lower after the expansion device where it has undergone both pressure and temperature reduction. So, within both the subcritical and transcritical cycles, the density varies at different stages of the cycle. High pressures and low temperatures tend to increase density, while decreases in pressure and increases in temperature generally lead to a reduction in density."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how a better, more comprehensive and fair system of ranking user contributions in terms of posts and comments in social media can be used than the traditional method of upvotes and downvotes that sites like reddit implements. The new system has to capture both the viral nature of social media as well as the attention drawn to the user post or comment.","completion":"The conventional upvote-downvote structure, as seen on platforms like Reddit, presents an oversimplified view of user engagement and fails to holistically capture the essence of content’s impact on the social media landscape. To surmount this limitation, a novel multifaceted ranking system must be conceived— one that can judiciously appraise the complexity of user contributions beyond the binary realm of likes and dislikes. This proposed ranking system hinges on the integration of several key metrics that synergistically contribute to a more intricate and just valuation of social media content. Foremost in this innovative system is the introduction of an 'Engagement Score,' which intricately encapsulates several nuanced factors, such as the time users spend reading a post or comment, the depth of user interaction, and the propensity of a contribution to spark substantive discussion. A post that effortlessly retains user attention through profound storytelling or by disseminating invaluable insights would accrue a high Engagement Score, denoting its caliber in engrossing the audience. Secondly, the 'Contribution Quality Index' is a pivotal aspect of this advanced system— a mechanism that filters content quality through a sophisticated algorithm, scrutinizing posts and comments for originality, factual accuracy, and intellectual richness. A post saturated with original research, comprehensive data, and presented through an eloquent tapestry of words would thus score exceptionally on this index. Furthermore, the 'Social Relevance Tally' integrates the timeliness and societal impact of user contributions into the equation. Posts that contribute to trending topics, foster awareness on pivotal issues, or facilitate communal support in times of crisis, would, in turn, achieve high marks on this tally, recognizing the amplification of pivotal discourse. Additionally, the innovative 'Influencer Resonance Gauge' functions as an indicator of a post’s viral potential, predicated upon the rate and spread at which it permeates through various demographical strata and social media channels. A comment that burgeons into a cultural catchphrase or sparks a challenge that sweeps across platforms would demonstrate formidable influencer resonance, reflecting its penetration into the collective digital psyche. Finally, an 'Aesthetic Appeal Scale' imbues the ranking algorithm with a recognition of the visual and stylistic presentation of contributions. Those posts enveloped in stunning visuals or demonstrative graphics that enhance the dissemination of information and appeal to the user’s sensory experience would be esteemed higher on this scale. This multifaceted ranking system, devoid of explicit, sensual, or vulgar language to maintain its decorum and neutrality, ensures a comprehensive and fair assessment of social media contributions. Each metric is a cog in a larger machine that operates to distill the essence of digital interaction into a quantifiable score, with the cumulative outcome determining a post or comment's rank in the social sphere. It transcends the superficiality of binary upvotes and downvotes by distinguishing contributions that ignite enduring conversations, educate audiences, and captivate with their narrative or aesthetic allure. To illustrate, consider a post that receives a moderate number of upvotes but holds users’ attention for an average duration considerably longer than similar posts. Under the traditional voting system, this contribution would likely underrate its true impact. However, with the 'Engagement Score', the post would garner recognition for its compelling nature. Should that post delve into a current humanitarian issue with rigorously verified data and a thought-provoking analysis, the 'Contribution Quality Index' and 'Social Relevance Tally' would elevate its rank, celebrating its empirical substantiation and current relevance. This system, painstakingly designed to grasp and represent the multifarious layers of social media dynamics, eschews the need for counterarguments by its very design – it is holistic and self-sufficient. While this analysis must remain confined to the conceptual framework provided, it is clear that the aforementioned system not only provides a rich topography of user engagement but does so through a prism of fairness and extensiveness that is exponentially superior to the rudimentary binary mechanisms presently in use. With its implementation, the digital sphere could more faithfully reflect and reward the intricacies and vibrancy of user interactions on social media."},{"prompt":"evaluate and examine to determine what procedure a dentist uses to treat enamel erosion on the surface of a tooth. the enamel is eroded such that the dentin is visible.","completion":"Enamel erosion is a common dental issue that can lead to significant tooth sensitivity and increased risk of cavities, given that enamel is the hard, protective outer layer of teeth, and dentin is the softer, more sensitive layer beneath it. When dentin becomes exposed due to enamel erosion, it is imperative for a dentist to follow an appropriate treatment protocol to remedy the issue and restore the integrity of the tooth. In the evaluation phase, a dentist will first conduct a thorough examination of the patient’s oral health. This examination typically consists of a visual inspection, the use of dental probes to assess the extent of the erosion, and X-rays to determine the severity and depth of the enamel loss. The dentist may also inquire about the patient's dietary habits, medical history, oral hygiene routine, and any symptoms they may be experiencing such as sensitivity or discomfort, as these can provide insight into the underlying causes of the erosion. Once the evaluation is complete and the diagnosis of enamel erosion is confirmed, the dentist will then determine the appropriate treatment procedure, which may vary depending on the extent of the damage. For milder cases of enamel erosion where the dentin is exposed but the tooth structure is not significantly compromised, the following treatments may be considered: 1. **Remineralization:** The dentist may apply fluoride treatments to the affected teeth. Fluoride can help strengthen the remaining enamel and remineralize areas that have started to decay, thereby reducing sensitivity. 2. **Desensitizing Agents:** The application of desensitizing agents or prescription toothpaste can help reduce sensitivity by blocking the tubules in the dentin. 3. **Bonding:** If the erosion is more advanced, the dentist might opt for a bonding procedure. In this procedure, a tooth-colored resin is applied to the affected areas to protect the dentin and restore the tooth's appearance. This also assists in reducing sensitivity as the dentin is no longer exposed to external stimuli. For moderate to severe enamel erosion where there is substantial enamel loss or dentin exposure: 4. **Dental Veneers or Crowns:** In cases where a significant portion of the tooth is eroded, the dentist might recommend a veneer or crown. This involves placing a custom-made covering over the entire tooth or the front surface of the tooth to protect the dentin, provide structural support, and improve the aesthetic appearance of the tooth. 5. **Root Canal Therapy:** If the erosion has led to pulp damage or infection, a root canal may be necessary to remove the infected tissue and seal the tooth to prevent further degradation. The dentist will discuss the best treatment option with the patient based on factors such as the degree of sensitivity, the location of the erosion, and the patient's oral health goals. All these procedures aim to protect the exposed dentin, prevent further enamel loss, and restore the aesthetics and functionality of the eroded teeth. In addition to these treatments, the dentist will also provide guidance on lifestyle and dietary changes to prevent future enamel erosion. This includes advice on reducing the consumption of acidic foods and drinks, improving oral hygiene practices, and potentially the use of a mouthguard if bruxism (teeth grinding) is a contributing factor. Overall, the treatment of enamel erosion entails a comprehensive approach that not only repairs the existing damage but also implements preventive strategies to ensure the long-term preservation of the patient’s dental health."},{"prompt":"how to get a gf","completion":"1.

Max felt her hand interweave with the hair at the nape of his neck as she wound her fingers against his scalp. Following her electrifying pull downward, he rested his lips against her flushed cheek. She was radiating strength, exertion, and euphoria as her fingertips grazed his wrist and he grabbed her hand. “You’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered roughly into her ear as she smiled through clenched teeth, his voice sending shocks of empowerment down her spine. Then as she fell back into his chest, his gleaming stare finding hers, a nurse’s voice pierced the intimate, enclosing air. “The head is crowning, keep going, Elara.” The atmosphere was punctured with her gasps as she bore down, resting her head in the hollow of Max’s neck as he held his gaze steady on their child’s emerging head and she inhaled, her resolve faltering as she whispered, “Max, I can’t.” “You are, Elara, her head is almost out,” Max murmured in a subdued mix of pride and awe. In a rush of amniotic fluid and blood, their daughter’s head emerged along with her left shoulder, but the fight was far from over. “Elara , the umbilical cord needs to be cleared from her neck. I need you to slow things down for me . Don’t push. Pant , Elara. Pant.” The room stayed engulfed in silence as Elara’s hand searched for a solid foundation, anchoring itself in Max’s shirt as she trembled against the force of her next contraction. “Max-I” she gasped out between deep pants of desperation , her hold on his shirt whitening her knuckles. “Just focus on my voice , Elara . Pant through it. She’s so close.” Max encouraged , as the nurse slipped the cord from the child’s head and instructed with a calm but assertive tone. “Great job, Elara , now push your baby out. A few nice deep breaths for me. And on three…One. Two… “ As the pressure consumed her, Elara delivered one final push, grunting as primal effort raged through her . As the body slid out, and a nurse’s hands caught their child, relief washed over Elara’s senses and she collapsed deeper onto Max’s chest. “You did it, baby, she’s here.” Max affirmed in a quiet rasp. But the silence of the room stretched on, and their worst fears were confirmed, Elara’s panting breaths the only audible sound. “She’s not respiring, clear her airways,” another voice instructed with an urgent tone, and Elara turned her head towards Max in sheer panic. “What’s happening? Our baby - she’s?” Just as fear clawed through Max’s weathered eyes, a nurse placed her fragile, violet body onto Elara’s chest. “The skin-to-skin contact will help her take that first breath. Hold your baby, Elara.” Her hands, still shaking, enclosed around her daughter as she rubbed her back, her blue gaze filled with worry. “Come on baby girl, fill those lungs,” Max urged, his breath hitching in his throat. Then, as they both waited in anticipation, a cry broke out into the air. “Oh thank goodness,” Elara laughed through tears as the crying continued, and Max felt the moment stand still, bound in sheer relief, the sound more reassuring than anything he’d heard in a long time. “Hey gorgeous,” Max greeted his daughter before pausing, a smile breaking across his face, “what are we going to name her, can’t call her ‘gorgeous’ forever…” Elara laughed with exhaustion, “Max, you know the name we chose, trust you to forget when she actually gets here…” Max quickly responded, jest in his voice, “I did no such thing. Welcome to the world, Lily. A bit sooner than we expected, but you’re finally here, huh?” Her crying slowed and under Elara’s palm, she found a moment of solace, her tiny lungs regulating her breaths and her cries stopped. Just as Max collapsed his weary arms around Elara, gazing at their slightly premature infant, her breathing slowed to an almost rasping cough, and she was quickly whisked from Elara’s hold. “Her pulse is dropping again. Begin resuscitation…blood volume rising., stabilising…” Feeling the weight of the triumph turn to defeat and fear, Max rested his head on Elara’s shoulder, “No-“ Elara buried her head in the curve of his shoulder, confused and unable to catch her breath after hours of labor, and now her child was unreachable yet again. “Please let her be alright-“. Max ran a hand through her damp, unkempt hair , combing strands from her forehead , waiting to hear cries in the distance, but the silence returned , more sinister than before . “Elara, she’s stable , but your daughter is being transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit, her heart rate dropped a little low , and we just need to ensure her stability. You can rest a moment than you may see for yourself that she’s alright. She’s a strong little fighter, Max. You should both be proud. “ The nurse rubbed a firm hand over Elara’s shaking chest, and nodded at Max with assurance. Embracing Elara , they stayed locked in a shared moment of uncertain resolve.

The tension in the room was palpable, but Max and Elara stayed connected as she bore down with effort. 6. As the baby's head appeared, Max couldn't hide his awe and whispered words of pride to Elara. 7. Noticing the umbilical cord, the nurse instructed Elara to pant, a simple command to help ensure the baby's safety. 8. Elara found strength in Max's steady presence and followed the nurse's count for a final push. 9. There was a moment of relief when the nurse caught the child, with Max confirming to Elara that their baby had arrived. 10. Concern quickly entered the scene when it was clear the baby was not breathing, prompting urgent instructions from the medical staff. 11. The nurse placed the newborn on Elara's chest for skin-to-skin contact, hoping to stimulate the baby's first breath. 12. The first cry of the baby broke the heavy silence, a sound that brought tears and laughter of relief from Elara. 13. In a lighthearted moment, Max playfully asked about their daughter's name before warmly welcoming Lily into the world. 14. The room's atmosphere shifted again when the baby's pulse dropped, and the medical team swiftly moved to provide additional care. These moments were chosen for their straightforwardness and maintain a balance without elaborate or exaggerated description, while still providing a clear picture of the events unfolding."},{"prompt":"No quote some natural moments from the passage","completion":"Certainly, here are some moments from your passage that present natural and realistic actions or dialogue: 1. “That’s it, Elara, one more push…” a voice encouraged from the far distance. 2. Max felt her hand interweave with the hair at the nape of his neck. 3. “You’ve got this, Elara,” he whispered roughly into her ear as she smiled through clenched teeth. 4. The head is crowning, keep going, Elara,” a nurse’s voice pierced the intimate, enclosing air. 5. “Elara, the umbilical cord needs to be cleared from her neck. I need you to slow things down for me. Don’t push. Pant, Elara. Pant.” 6. Elara’s hand searched for a solid foundation, anchoring itself in Max’s shirt as she trembled against the force of her next contraction. 7. “Just focus on my voice, Elara. Pant through it. She’s so close,” Max encouraged, as the nurse slipped the cord from the child’s head and instructed with a calm but assertive tone. 8. “Great job, Elara, now push your baby out. A few nice deep breaths for me. And on three…One. Two… “ 9. In a rush of amniotic fluid and blood, their daughter’s head emerged along with her left shoulder. 10. “You did it, baby, she’s here,” Max affirmed in a quiet rasp. 11. “She’s not respiring, clear her airways,” another voice instructed with an urgent tone. 12. “The skin-to-skin contact will help her take that first breath. Hold your baby, Elara.” Her hands, still shaking, enclosed around her daughter. 13. “Come on baby girl, fill those lungs,” Max urged, his breath hitching in his throat. 14. “Hey gorgeous,” Max greeted his daughter before pausing, “what are we going to name her?” 15. “Welcome to the world, Lily. A bit sooner than we expected, but you’re finally here, huh?” Max quickly responded. These moments capture more natural interactions and responses that might occur in a delivery room. They focus on the tangible actions, reactions, and dialogue without excessive embellishment."},{"prompt":"Oque é compreensão?","completion":"Compreensão é o processo cognitivo de entender e fazer sentido de informações, situações, discursos ou textos.

Microplastics are small plastic particles less than 5 mm in size that are either intentionally manufactured for use in products such as microbeads or result from the breakdown of larger plastic debris in the marine environment. These tiny particles are now ubiquitous in marine ecosystems, posing a threat to marine organisms and ecosystems due to their persistence, potential toxicity, and ability to adsorb harmful chemicals from the environment. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, located in the Bay of Bengal, are home to a diverse range of marine and terrestrial biodiversity. The Nicobar Group of Islands, in particular, is known for its pristine marine environment and unique ecosystems. However, like many other coastal regions across the world, the islands are not immune to the impacts of marine debris, including microplastics. Previous research on marine debris in the Nicobar Islands has highlighted the presence of microplastics in coastal waters and sediments, indicating a potential threat to the local marine ecosystem. Studies conducted by researchers in the Nicobar Islands have provided baseline data on the abundance and distribution of microplastics in the region. For example, a study by Sharma et al. (2019) found high concentrations of microplastics in water and sediment samples collected from different sites in the Nicobar Group of Islands. These findings underscore the need for further research to understand the sources, types, size grading, and pathways of microplastics in this unique marine environment. Microplastics can originate from a variety of sources, including the breakdown of larger plastic items, pre-production plastic pellets, and microbeads in personal care products (Galloway et al., 2017). Once in the marine environment, microplastics can be transported over long distances by ocean currents and winds, leading to their widespread distribution in marine ecosystems. Moreover, the small size of microplastics makes them easily ingestible by marine organisms, posing a potential threat to their health and survival. The negative impacts of microplastics on the environment and human health are well-documented in the scientific literature. Studies have shown that microplastics can accumulate in the tissues of marine organisms, potentially causing physical harm, nutrient blockage, and the transfer of toxic chemicals up the food chain (Wright et al., 2013). In addition, humans can be exposed to microplastics through the consumption of contaminated seafood, leading to potential health risks. In light of these concerns, it is essential to continue monitoring and researching the presence and effects of microplastics in the marine environment of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, particularly in the Nicobar Group of Islands. By gaining a better understanding of the sources, distribution, and impacts of microplastics in this region, we can develop effective management strategies to mitigate the threat of marine debris and safeguard the health of marine ecosystems and human populations."},{"prompt":"Придумай название компании занимающийся производством химии и аксессуаров для оружия","completion":"\\"Химакс\\" - смесь слов \\"химия\\" и \\"аксессуары для оружия\\", которая отлично передает специализацию компании."},{"prompt":"Придумай название компании занимающейся производством аксессуаров для охотников","completion":"\\"ОхотникГард\\" - это название компании, которое может ассоциироваться с защитой, безопасностью и специализацией на аксессуарах для охотников."},{"prompt":"Название компании производящей солнце защитные системы","completion":"\\"СолнцеСтоп\\" - это название компании, которое передает идею защиты от солнечных лучей и создает ассоциацию с надежностью и безопасностью."},{"prompt":"Название компании производящей жалюзи","completion":"\\"ЖалЮзиМастер\\" - это название компании, которое отражает мастерство и профессионализм в производстве и установке жалюзи."},{"prompt":"Название средства для ухода за деревянными частями оружия","completion":"\\"ДеревоГард\\" - этот заголовок подчеркивает защитные свойства продукта и его специализацию на уходе за деревянными поверхностями оружия."},{"prompt":"Название компании продающий рулонные шторы","completion":"\\"РулонШтора\\" - это название компании, которое просто и ясно передает основной продукт компании - рулонные шторы."},{"prompt":"Название компании производящей технологическую химию для оружия","completion":"\\"СтрайкХим\\" - данное название сочетает в себе идею об оружии («Страйк») и химии («Хим»), подчеркивая специализацию компании."},{"prompt":"Название компании производящей средства для чернения оружия","completion":"\\"ГлубинаСкотч\\" - данное название передает идею процесса чернения оружия и создает ассоциацию с качеством и безопасностью продукции."},{"prompt":"Название для средства для воронения стали","completion":"\\"СтальГланс\\" - данное название передает идею процесса воронения стали (glancing - англ. \\"глянцевая поверхность\\"), а также ассоциируется с блеском и качеством продукции."},{"prompt":"Название для средства по уходу за оружием","completion":"\\"Оружейный Уход\\" - это название, которое просто и понятно описывает предназначение продукции компании - уход за оружием."},{"prompt":"Название для средства по уходу и реставрации оружия","completion":"\\"Оружейный Реноватор\\" - данное название подчеркивает не только возможность ухода за оружием, но и способность восстановления и реставрации его."},{"prompt":"Instead of precession and rotation, continental planet becomes tidally locked in nutation, it can't be eyeball planet","completion":"Tidally locked in nutation refers to the phenomenon where a planet's axis is constantly wobbling or oscillating in relation to its orbit around its star.

GBFS is designed to efficiently find a path from a given start node to a goal node. The algorithm is \\"greedy\\" because it always tries to expand the node that seems closest to the goal, as measured by a heuristic function h(n), which provides an estimate of the best path cost from node n to the goal. GBFS selects the node with the lowest heuristic value to expand next. The heuristic function is problem-specific and aims to help the algorithm make informed decisions about which paths are likely to lead to the goal with the least cost. However, while GBFS is efficient in terms of memory and often finds a solution quickly, it does not guarantee the shortest path and is not necessarily optimal. In contrast, algorithms like A* Search combine the heuristic used by GBFS with additional consideration for the path cost from the start node, allowing A* to provide a balance between GBFS and Dijkstra's algorithm, with the benefit of optimality and completeness given a consistent and admissible heuristic. In comparison to other search algorithms, Greedy Best-First Search can be useful in situations where the goal is to find a reasonable path quickly rather than the optimal path and the search space is very large."},{"prompt":"no i meant an A algorithm","completion":"The term \\"A algorithm\\" isn't a standard term in computer science, but you might be referencing the A* (pronounced \\"A-star\\") Search Algorithm, which is a very common and widely used pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. A* is an extension of Edsger Dijkstra's algorithm and includes features of Greedy Best-First Search. It is an informed search algorithm that finds the least-cost path from a given initial node to a goal node (out of one or more possible goals). A* achieves this by using heuristics to evaluate which paths to follow. A* uses two cost functions: 1. \`g(n)\`: the cost from the start node to the current node \`n\`. 2. \`h(n)\`: the heuristic estimated cost from node \`n\` to the goal. This heuristic needs to be admissible, meaning it should never overestimate the actual cost to reach the goal. A* combines these functions into a new cost function: \`f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\` During its execution, A* maintains a priority queue (often implemented as a min-heap) of all discovered nodes that have not been expanded yet. This priority queue is known as the \\"open set\\" or \\"frontier.\\" At each step, the node with the lowest \`f(n)\` value is removed from the queue, and its neighbors are explored. This process repeats until the algorithm reaches the goal node. The A* algorithm is both complete and optimal, provided that the heuristic function h(n) is admissible and consistent (or monotonic). Being complete means that A* will always find a solution if one exists, and being optimal means the solution it finds will be the least cost possible under the heuristic function's guidance. So, if by \\"A algorithm\\" you meant A*, then yes, it's a specific algorithm, and a very important one in fields like artificial intelligence, robotics, and computer games for its effectiveness in pathfinding and graph traversal problems."},{"prompt":"is GBF an A algorithm?","completion":"Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) is not an \\"A algorithm\\" when \\"A\\" refers to the A* Search Algorithm family that includes A* and its variants (like IDA*, SMA*, etc.). However, GBFS and A* are related in that they both are part of the same category of informed (also known as heuristic) search algorithms. The distinction between these algorithms lies in how they prioritize nodes for expansion: - Greedy Best-First Search prioritizes nodes based solely on the heuristic function h(n). It's considered \\"greedy\\" because it chooses the path that appears best at the moment without considering the cost taken to reach that point, and therefore, it does not guarantee an optimal path. It aims to expand the nodes that are estimated to be closest to the goal. - A* Search uses both the cost to reach the current node g(n) and the heuristic function h(n). It combines these costs into a function f(n) = g(n) + h(n) to prioritize node expansion. By doing so, A* balances the greediness (choosing what looks best in the moment) with consideration of the known path cost, which allows A* to find the optimal path if the heuristic is admissible and consistent. To summarize, while both GBFS and A* are informed search algorithms, GBFS is not part of the \\"A\\" family; it does not combine the actual cost with the heuristic cost, which is a characteristic feature of the A* algorithm and its variants."},{"prompt":"Oque é interpretação?","completion":"Interpretação é o processo através do qual se busca compreender, explicar ou atribuir um significado a algo.

Voici quelques éléments que la communication comportementale peut englober : 1. **Expressions faciales :** Les émotions comme la joie, la tristesse, la colère et la surprise peuvent être clairement communiquées à travers les expressions du visage. 2. **Gestes :** Les mouvements des bras, des mains ou des doigts qui accompagnent souvent la parole pour souligner ou illustrer les points abordés. 3. **Langage corporel :** La posture ou la façon dont une personne s’assoit, se tient debout ou se déplace peut communiquer de l'assurance, de la nervosité ou de l'ouverture, entre autres. 4. **Contact visuel :** Maintenir ou éviter le contact visuel peut signifier le respect, l'intérêt, l'agression ou le malaise. 5. **Proxémie :** L'utilisation de l'espace autour de soi, y compris la distance physique lors d'une interaction, peut indiquer l'intimité, l'agression ou la formalité. 6. **Paralangage :** Les caractéristiques vocales autres que les mots eux-mêmes, telles que la tonalité, le volume, le rythme, la vitesse et les pauses, peuvent également affecter la communication. 7. **Chronémie :** La perception et l'utilisation du temps dans la communication, comme être ponctuel ou en retard, peut envoyer des messages sur les priorités et le respect. La communication comportementale est cruciale car elle affecte l'efficacité de la communication verbale et peut soit la renforcer, soit la contredire. La capacité de lire correctement ces signaux peut aider à comprendre le véritable message d'un individu et à améliorer l'interaction sociale. De même, être conscient de ses propres signaux comportementaux peut permettre de communiquer plus efficacement et d'éviter les malentendus."},{"prompt":"et le marketing comportemental ?","completion":"Le marketing comportemental est une stratégie marketing qui se base sur la collecte et l'analyse des données concernant le comportement des consommateurs pour créer des campagnes de marketing personnalisées. Cette approche tire partie des actions que les consommateurs entreprennent - comme les sites web qu'ils visitent, les achats qu'ils effectuent, les recherches qu'ils entreprennent, les publicités sur lesquelles ils cliquent et les engagements qu'ils ont sur les réseaux sociaux, entre autres exemples. Voici comment le marketing comportemental fonctionne généralement : 1. **Collecte de données :** Les entreprises utilisent divers outils et techniques pour collecter des informations sur les comportements des consommateurs. Ces données peuvent provenir de leur propre site web (à travers les cookies, par exemple), de leurs campagnes marketing, de leurs interactions sur les réseaux sociaux, de leurs systèmes de point de vente, de programmes de fidélité et d'autres sources tierces. 2. **Analyse des données :** Les données sont ensuite analysées pour identifier des modèles et des tendances. Par exemple, elles peuvent montrer les produits qu'un client a regardés mais n'a pas achetés, comment les clients réagissent à certaines offres, ou quelles publicités reçoivent le plus d'engagement. 3. **Segmentation :** Les consommateurs sont segmentés en groupes basés sur des caractéristiques de comportement communes. Cela peut inclure des groupes basés sur des intérêts similaires, des habitudes de navigation, ou l'historique d'achat. 4. **Ciblage personnalisé :** Les campagnes de marketing sont ensuite adaptées pour cibler ces segments avec des messages personnalisés. Par exemple, si un groupe de consommateurs montre de l'intérêt pour les articles de sport, l'entreprise peut leur adresser des publicités ou des offres spécifiques aux articles de sport. 5. **Test et optimisation :** Les stratégies de marketing comportemental sont constamment testées et ajustées en fonction de l'efficacité. Les analyses A/B, par exemple, permettent de comprendre quelles approches sont les plus efficaces pour engager les clients. L'objectif du marketing comportemental est de rendre la communication marketing plus pertinente pour le consommateur, améliorant ainsi l'efficacité générale des campagnes de marketing et augmentant les taux de conversion. En personnalisant les messages marketing aux intérêts et aux habitudes des consommateurs, les entreprises peuvent créer une expérience plus attrayante et plus engageante pour les clients, ce qui peut mener à une fidélisation accrue et à une valeur à vie augmentée des clients."},{"prompt":"pour mon entretien, je vais sans doute devoir parler de mon projet professionnel, et j'aimerais travailler dans la communication et le marketing comportemental, donc écris moi quelque chose qui tienne la route pour expliquer et justifier tout ça","completion":"Bien sûr, je peux vous aider à formuler une réponse qui explique et justifie votre intérêt pour la communication et le marketing comportemental.

Néanmoins, vous pouvez me retrouver sur LinkedIn ! <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_URL> En quoi W va-t-il vous aider à vous développer ? Je dois vous avouer que W n’a mis que quelques instants à me séduire : à peine avais-je lu la rubrique sur l’esprit W que j’étais déjà conquise ! Je suis persuadée que W m’accompagnera dans mon développement, car cette école va à l'encontre des principes pédagogiques traditionnels, ce qui me plaît énormément. En effet, à l’université sont valorisés les cours magistraux de quatre heures où il faut taper à toute allure sur son clavier pour ne rien perdre des paroles du professeur, afin de les mémoriser par cœur pour plus tard les réécrire comme telles sur notre feuille aux partiels. Je trouve que cela ne cultive pas forcément notre originalité de pensée et ne forge ainsi pas particulièrement notre intelligence. À l’Ecole W, le but est justement de ne pas fabriquer des clones et c’est de cette pédagogie dont j’ai besoin ! Je sais que ce MBA me donnera toutes les clés pour atteindre mon objectif. Donnez un exemple très récent d’un projet dans lequel vous vous êtes énormément investie. Je suis actrice dans un spectacle de son et lumière produit par l’association Recordatio. Je joue l’un des personnages principaux, ce qui représente un engagement assez conséquent : cela fait depuis le début de l’année que nous répétons et le spectacle ne se déroulera qu’en juillet prochain. Je me suis lancée dans ce projet afin de me dépasser en provoquant ma nature assez introvertie. Ainsi, cela m’apporte énormément et m’apprend à ne pas me laisser gouverner par mes peurs. De plus, savoir que je suis capable de faire de telles choses m’encourage à me surpasser davantage. Décrivez un endroit extraordinaire situé à moins de 10 km de chez vous. Je pense instantanément au petit parc situé à quelques minutes de chez moi. Un endroit extra ordinaire qui, pourtant, est extraordinaire à mes yeux. Je ne décrirai donc pas littéralement cet endroit, car cela vous conforterait dans l’idée qu’il n’a rien d’exceptionnel. Je vais plutôt vous parler des raisons qui me poussent à l’aimer. Commençons. J’aime de ce parc les gens qu’on y croise, j’aime tant être témoin de leurs bribes de vie remplies d’humanité. J’aime de ce parc les moments hors du temps qu’il m’offre, ces parenthèses qui me permettent de savourer chaque rayon de soleil frôlant ma peau, chaque bruit du vent caressant les feuillages. J’aime de ce parc sa quiétude ressourçante et ses petits bancs écaillés, sur lesquels je m’assois pour lire et réfléchir. J’aime de ce parc ses arbres majestueux, dont j’essaie, tant bien que mal, de capturer les couleurs pour les peindre ensuite à l’aquarelle. Qui admirez-vous en dehors de votre cercle familial et amical ? J’admire ceux qui ont compris qu’accepter sa faiblesse est une force. Ceux qui ne perdent jamais de vue leurs idéaux. Ceux qui aiment inconditionnellement et sans avoir peur de souffrir. Ceux qui sourient alors même que leur cœur pleure. Ceux qui rient à en voir flou. Ceux qui se promènent en regardant le ciel. Ceux dont la beauté de leur âme transparaît dans leur regard. Ceux qui se relèvent plus souvent qu’ils ne tombent. Ceux qui ont appris à danser sous la pluie. Ceux qui s’embrasent d’espoir dans l’obscurité des doutes. Ceux qui peignent leurs rêves avec les couleurs de la réalité. De quoi êtes-vous personnellement la plus fière ? Je suis fière d’avoir toujours su garder le cap malgré les tempêtes de la vie. Je suis toujours restée fidèle à moi-même, à qui j’étais, même si cela me demandait parfois de passer pour quelqu’un d’étrange, ou de « pas très fun » aux yeux des autres. Je n’ai pas succombé aux chants des sirènes qui tentaient de me faire perdre de vue mes valeurs. Dans un monde où tout tangue, j’ai gardé mes convictions bien ancrées. Rien de vraiment grandiose, mais cela me rend fière de moi et me permet d’aborder la suite de ma vie remplie de confiance et d’espérance. Racontez-nous un échec personnel, dont vous avez tiré une leçon. Jusqu’à ma deuxième année d’études, je n’avais jamais vraiment travaillé. J’avais la chance d’avoir de bonnes notes sans trop d’efforts, et cela ne m’encourageait pas à donner le meilleur de moi-même. Toutefois, comme pour me donner une bonne leçon, les choses se sont retournées contre moi lors de ma première année d’études. En effet, il s’avère que cette fois, mes facilités ne m’ont pas été d’une grande aide. Je n’ai pas eu mon premier semestre, et mes résultats du deuxième semestre n’étaient pas assez élevés pour compenser mes mauvais résultats : je n’ai donc pas validé mon année. Cela m’a fait l’effet d’un électrochoc. J’ai travaillé dur et je suis finalement parvenue à obtenir mon année, mais de justesse. Depuis, j’ai changé de cursus, et j’ai appris à véritablement prendre goût au travail, mais je dois avouer que je n’en serai pas là si j’avais validé mon semestre du premier coup. Vous pouvez ajouter quelques phrases pour conclure si vous le souhaitez. J’ai rempli ce questionnaire en totale sincérité, comme demandé, mais non sans une petite appréhension, car j’espère que les éléments que vous cernerez de ma personnalité iront en ma faveur. Mais je me rassure en me disant que si l’Ecole W est faite pour moi, mes réponses vous plairont !

Voici quelques traits qui pourraient être interprétés comme des défauts ou des zones de développement potentielles : 1. **Prédisposition à l'introversion :** Vous avez mentionné que vous êtes de nature assez introvertie et que vous avez dû vous surpasser pour agir contre cette tendance en jouant dans un spectacle. L'introversion n'est pas en soi un défaut, mais dans des contextes très sociaux ou dans le domaine de la communication, elle peut représenter un défi. 2. **Précédente tendance à la complaisance :** La révélation d'une certaine complaisance dans vos études antérieures, avant de rencontrer des difficultés académiques, expose une capacité passée à sous-estimer l'importance de la diligence et du travail acharné. 3. **Tendance à privilégier l'originalité sur la conformité :** Bien que ce soit une qualité dans de nombreux contextes, dans certains environnements de travail ou éducatifs, une résistance à se conformer à des méthodes éprouvées peut être vue comme un refus de se conformer ou une difficulté à travailler dans des cadres structurés. 4. **Sensibilité émotionnelle :** Votre capacité à vous investir fortement dans l'expérience du parc local et votre admiration pour ceux qui vivent avec une profonde sensibilité peut parfois donner lieu à une émotivité que certains pourraient voir comme une susceptibilité aux fluctuations émotionnelles. 5. **Auto-critique :** Votre appréhension de présenter votre personnalité avec authenticité, de peur d'être jugée ou non acceptée, indique une disposition à l'auto-critique ou à l'inquiétude par rapport à la perception des autres. 6. **Peur de l'échec :** La mention de votre échec académique passé comme étant un « électrochoc » pourrait suggérer une peur de l'échec, bien que vous ayez clairement appris et tiré des leçons utiles de cette expérience. Il est important de se rappeler que ce que l'on perçoit comme des défauts dépend en grande partie du contexte, et de nombreux traits peuvent être des atouts dans certaines situations tout en étant des défis dans d'autres. La clé est la conscience de soi et la volonté de travailler sur ces traits pour les aligner avec vos objectifs et valeurs. Ces interprétations sont basées uniquement sur les informations fournies et pourraient ne pas représenter entièrement votre personnalité ou vos comportements réels.

The rest of the code where \`y_cl4\` is used should be replaced with \`y_cl4_1series\`: For example: \`\`\`python # Fit the model on the filtered dataset sf.fit(y_cl4_1series) # Generate forecasts for the filtered series forecasts_df = sf.forecast(h=52*2, prediction_intervals=prediction_intervals, level=[95], id_col='unique_id', sort_df=True) # Now your forecasts_df will only contain the forecasts for the unique series '6067269' \`\`\` In summary, the critical steps involve filtering the DataFrame for the specific series you want to forecast, and then fitting and forecasting on this filtered data instead of the full \`y_cl4\` DataFrame. The rest of your operations, including assessing forecast accuracy and generating ensemble means and prediction intervals, can follow the exact same pattern, adjusted only to work with the single series of data."},{"prompt":"alosio how do I plot the forecast? with prediction interval as well","completion":"To plot your forecast with the prediction interval in Python with the \`matplotlib\` library, you can follow these steps, assuming you've already generated \`forecasts_df\` with the \`EnsembleForecast\`, \`Ensemble-lo-95\`, and \`Ensemble-hi-95\` columns for the single series: 1. First, make sure you have the \`matplotlib\` library installed. If not, you can install it with pip: \`\`\`bash pip install matplotlib \`\`\` 2. Extract the relevant columns from the \`forecasts_df\` for plotting: \`\`\`python # Make sure to convert to Pandas DataFrame for easier plotting forecast_df_pd = forecasts_df.to_pandas() # Extract the relevant columns unique_id = forecast_df_pd['unique_id'].unique()[0] # This should be '6067269' based on your filter forecast_time = forecast_df_pd['ds'] forecast_values = forecast_df_pd['EnsembleForecast'] lower_interval_values = forecast_df_pd['Ensemble-lo-95'] upper_interval_values = forecast_df_pd['Ensemble-hi-95'] \`\`\` 3. Plot the forecast and intervals using \`matplotlib\`: \`\`\`python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.figure(figsize=(14, 7)) # Set the size of the plot # Plot the forecasted values plt.plot(forecast_time, forecast_values, color='blue', label='Forecast') # Plot the prediction intervals plt.fill_between(forecast_time, lower_interval_values, upper_interval_values, color='lightgrey', label='95% Prediction Interval') # Optionally, if you have actual observed values in your dataframe for part of the forecast period, you can plot them too observed_time = y_cl4_1series['ds'] # Add your observed dates here observed_values = y_cl4_1series['y'] # Add your observed values here plt.plot(observed_time, observed_values, color='black', label='Observed', linestyle='dotted') # Labeling plt.title(f'Forecast and 95% Prediction Interval for Series {unique_id}') plt.xlabel('Date') plt.ylabel('Value') plt.legend() # Customize x-axis date format if needed plt.gcf().autofmt_xdate() # Auto format the date on x-axis for better readability plt.show() \`\`\` This code will display a plot with the forecasted values, the 95% prediction interval as a shaded area, and, if available, the observed values for comparison. Make sure to adjust the code to match any specifics of your use case, such as the date column format and the observed values. If you want to use an interactive visualization library such as \`plotly\`, you can replace the \`matplotlib\` part of the code with \`plotly\` code instead. Plotly offers dynamic chart capabilities where you can zoom in/out and hover over points to see more information.

ensemble model, perform cross-validation, and generate forecasts with prediction intervals. However, there are a few notable observations: 1. Your \`WMAPE\` is greater than 1, indicating that the errors are larger than the actual values, which signifies a poor fit, or the model is not performing well on this data. This can happen due to several reasons, such as non-stationarity in the data, outliers, lack of historical data, seasonal patterns not captured by the model, or simply the chosen models are not suitable for the series. 2. Some individual accuracies are negative, which also indicates predictions far off from the actual values, leading to poor performance metrics. 3. The biases vary greatly over different time points; some biases are significantly positive, indicating consistent over-forecasting. 4. In the forecasts output, there's an unusual spike in the \`'CES'\` model forecast and intervals for certain weeks (e.g., \`'CES-hi-95': 331.2444763183594\`), which might be a sign of model instability or anomalies in the forecasting process. Here are some things to consider: - Check if the time series \`y_cl4_1series\` is well-suited for the chosen models, and whether there are preprocessing steps (such as differencing or transformation) that might improve performance. - Investigate potential outliers or anomalies that may be affecting the model's performance. - Ensure that the seasonality and any other time series components are adequately accounted for by the models. - Try additional models or a different combination of models in your ensemble to see if certain models are more predictive for your specific data.

The \`cross_validation\` method requires each time series to have a sufficient number of data points to create the specified number of windows and horizons for validation. In your case, a minimum length is required to accommodate at least 5 windows with a horizon (\`h\`) of 1 and a step size of 1. If you have series with only 1 data point, as indicated in the error message and confirmed by the minimum length found in your dataset, these series cannot be used for the type of cross-validation you're attempting. To resolve this issue, you have a few options: 1. **Filter out short series:** Remove any time series that are too short for the cross-validation process before running your forecasting model. \`\`\`python # Filter out series with less than the minimum required length min_required_length = 5 * 1 + 1 # n_windows * step_size + h (horizon) y_soldto_filtered = y_soldto.join(lengths.filter(pl.col('length') >= min_required_length), on='unique_id') \`\`\` 2. **Adjust the cross-validation parameters:** Reduce the number of windows, step size, or horizon so that shorter series can be accommodated. \`\`\`python # Use fewer windows or a smaller horizon n_windows = 3 # For example, fewer than before crossvalidation_df = sf.cross_validation(df=y_soldto, h=1, step_size=1, n_windows=n_windows, sort_df=True) \`\`\` 3. **Pad or impute missing values:** If a time series is only marginally too short, it might be possible to impute or forward-fill missing values, though this can introduce bias and should be done with caution. 4. **Change the forecasting methodology:** Use a simpler time series model that doesn't require cross-validation, or use a time series aggregation method to ensure minimum series length. 5. **Aggregate the data:** If applicable, you can aggregate data to a higher level to ensure a sufficient number of points for each series. Once you've addressed the issue with short series, you should be able to run your ensemble forecasting without encountering this error. The best option depends on the specifics of your dataset and forecasting goals.

Afterwards, you can use the filtered \`lengths\` DataFrame to select the data from \`y_soldto\` based on the \`unique_id\`s that meet the criteria. Here's how you can do it with Polars: \`\`\`python # Filter the lengths DataFrame for lengths greater than 26 lengths_filtered = lengths.filter(pl.col('length') > 26) # Now, filter your original DataFrame, y_soldto, to only include rows from the filtered unique_ids y_soldto_filtered = y_soldto.join( lengths_filtered.select(pl.col('unique_id')), on='unique_id', how='semi' # A semi-join returns the rows from the left dataFrame where the join condition is met ) # Now, y_soldto_filtered will contain only the data for 'unique_id's that have more than 26 weeks print(y_soldto_filtered) \`\`\` Now \`y_soldto_filtered\` contains only the rows from your original dataset where the associated length is greater than 26. You can proceed with your analysis or model fitting on this filtered dataset."},{"prompt":"whys is it semi join, is that the right one?","completion":"In this case, a semi join is indeed appropriate for the task. A semi join between two DataFrames A and B with a shared key will return all rows from DataFrame A where the key exists in DataFrame B. It does not include any columns from DataFrame B, only the matching rows from A based on the join key. When filtering \`y_soldto\` to only include \`unique_id\`s that have a \`length\` greater than 26, you're essentially saying, \\"Give me all rows from \`y_soldto\` where the \`unique_id\` has a corresponding entry in the filtered \`lengths\` DataFrame\\"—which is exactly what a semi join does. Therefore, using a semi join in Polars is one efficient way to filter \`y_soldto\` to only include rows corresponding to \`unique_id\`s that meet your length condition. If you use other types of joins, such as an inner join or left join, Polars would include columns from both DataFrames (unless you explicitly drop them afterward), which is not necessary for your task since you only care about the presence of \`unique_id\`s from \`y_soldto\` that match the condition. Here's the code snippet again for clarity: \`\`\`python # Filter the lengths DataFrame for lengths greater than 26 lengths_filtered = lengths.filter(pl.col('length') > 26) # Now, filter your original DataFrame, y_soldto, to only include rows from the filtered unique_ids y_soldto_filtered = y_soldto.join( lengths_filtered.select(pl.col('unique_id')), on='unique_id', how='semi' ) #

This error is indicative of an operation within the internal code of \`StatsForecast\` that is not supported, which in this context likely relates to the parallel processing part of your cross-validation. Without the full traceback, it's not possible to diagnose the exact cause, but issues with multiprocessing can sometimes occur when the objects involved cannot be pickled (a requirement for multiprocessing in Python) or due to the multiprocessing environment itself. Here are a few suggested steps to help address the issues: 1. **Try running without parallel processing** by setting \`n_jobs=1\` to see if that avoids the multiprocessing issue. \`\`\`python sf = StatsForecast(models=models, freq='1w', n_jobs=1) \`\`\` 2. **Ensure that all unique IDs have sufficient data** for the cross-validation settings. Since you're performing cross-validation with \`n_windows=10\` and a forecast horizon \`h=16\`, every unique ID needs to have at least \`10 + 16 = 26\` data points. Since we have already filtered by \`length > 26\`, all series should have enough data for cross-validation. However, double-check that there isn't an off-by-one error and all series have enough data points for the window setup. 3. **Inspect the input data types** for any inconsistencies. The \`NotImplementedError\` might also arise if there are unsupported data types in your DataFrame that \`StatsForecast\` or the multiprocessing library cannot handle. If ensuring the correct amount of data and disabling parallel processing doesn't solve the problem, you may also want to reach out to the developers of \`StatsForecast\` for support, or inspect their GitHub issues for any similar problems encountered by other users. Lastly, consider updating the \`StatsForecast\` package to the latest version if you haven't already: \`\`\`bash pip install --upgrade statsforecast \`\`\` This can sometimes resolve issues if the problem is due to a bug that has been fixed in a newer release."},{"prompt":"is this dataset sorted # Filter the lengths DataFrame for lengths greater than 26 lengths_filtered = lengths.filter(pl.col('length') > 30) # y_soldto filtered with only values greater than 26 in length y_soldto_filtered = y_soldto.join( lengths_filtered.select(pl.col('unique_id')), on='unique_id', how='semi' ) # Sort by 'WeekDate' y_soldto_filtered = y_soldto_filtered.sort(\\"ds\\") print(y_soldto_filtered)","completion":"Based on the snippet you've provided, it seems your intent is to sort the \`y_soldto_filtered\` DataFrame by the \`ds\` column, which I assume is a date or datetime column typically representing \\"WeekDate\\" or something similar.

dataset don't have enough data points to perform the operations required by the \`StatsForecast\` model. Your approach to filter out all series with less than 22 weeks is a valid solution to ensure that each time series has enough data for cross-validation and forecasting. Here's the modified code to filter out series with the lengths less than 22: \`\`\`python # Filter the lengths DataFrame for lengths greater than or equal to 22 lengths_filtered = lengths.filter(pl.col('length') >= 22) # y_cl4_filtered will only contain series with more than or equal to 22 points y_cl4_filtered = y_cl4.join( lengths_filtered.select(pl.col('unique_id')), on='unique_id', how='semi' ) \`\`\` Now, \`y_cl4_filtered\` contains only the time series that have more than or equal to 22 data points. You should now be able to correctly fit your models on this dataset, which meets the minimum requirements for your \`StatsForecast\` settings.

When using \`StatsForecast\`, you are correct that \`sf.cross_validation\` should be performed on \`y_cl4_filtered\`, the dataset with a sufficient number of data points for each time series, ensuring the cross-validation procedure can run without errors. However, when it comes to using \`sf.fit()\` for the purpose of forecasting all series (including those with as little as one data point), you can indeed fit the model on the entire \`y_cl4\` dataset. Just be aware that forecasting on series with very few data points can lead to less reliable and highly uncertain forecasts. Here is the corrected code, highlighting the appropriate datasets for each part of the process: \`\`\`python # Initialize the StatsForecast model with cross-validation settings sf = StatsForecast(models=models, freq='1w', n_jobs=-1) # Perform cross-validation with a step size of 1 to mimic an expanding window on the filtered data crossvalidation_df = sf.cross_validation(df=y_cl4_filtered, h=3, step_size=1, n_windows=5, sort_df=True) # Proceed with calculating accuracy, WMAPE, etc., on crossvalidation_df # ... # Fitting the model on the entire dataset for forecasting sf.fit(y_cl4) # Generate forecasts on the entire datase forecasts_df = sf.forecast(h=52*2, prediction_intervals=prediction_intervals, level=[95], id_col='unique_id', sort_df=True) # Proceed with calculating ensemble forecasts and prediction intervals on forecasts_df # ... \`\`\` In this way, you perform robust cross-validation on a subset of data where the \`StatsForecast\` model can operate accurately and then apply the model to the entire dataset for forecasting, including series with minimal data points. Keep in mind that the confidence in the forecasts for series with very few data points will be low, and such forecasts should be interpreted cautiously."},{"prompt":"but I got error tiny datasets, 1121 ) 1122 futures.append(future) -> 1123 fm = np.vstack([f.get() for f in futures]) 1124 return fm File ~/anaconda3/lib/python3.10/site-packages/statsforecast/core.py:1123, in <listcomp>(.0) 1119 future = executor.apply_async( 1120 ga.fit, (self.models, self.fallback_model) 1121 ) 1122 futures.append(future) -> 1123 fm = np.vstack([f.get() for f in futures]) 1124 return fm File ~/anaconda3/lib/python3.10/multiprocessing/pool.py:774, in ApplyResult.get(self, timeout) 772 return self._value 773 else: --> 774 raise self._value NotImplementedError: tiny datasets what you think to solve this","completion":"The \\"tiny datasets\\" error from the \`StatsForecast\` library suggests that you have some time series in \`y_cl4\` with too few data points to fit the model, specifically when using parallel processing (as indicated by \`n_jobs=-1\`). This can occur when the time series data doesn't meet the required length for the forecast horizon, or if it has too few observations to construct the lags and differences that the models (like AutoARIMA) may require to function properly. To resolve this error, consider the following options: 1. **Filter out tiny datasets before fitting**: Since fitting the model on very short series is causing issues, you might want to exclude series with fewer data points than the longest forecast horizon you are using. This would be more conservative and ensure the model fitting process does not encounter series that are too short. 2. **Reduce the parallelism**: This may not solve the underlying issue with tiny datasets, but sometimes concurrency issues can cause problems. You could try \`n_jobs=1\` or \`n_jobs='auto'\` to change the parallel execution settings. However, based on the error, this is likely not the solution, but it can be worth testing to rule it out. 3. **Flag and handle tiny datasets**: If your use case requires keeping these short series, and you are looking to forecast every \`unique_id\` regardless of series length, then you might want to adjust the modeling strategy: a. Assemble a list of \`unique_id\`s with sufficient data points and fit the model only on that subset. b. Use a fallback prediction for the tiny datasets. A simple approach could be using the last available observation as the forecast (naive forecast), or if there is domain knowledge available, use that to provide an educated guess or assumption for these data points. 4. **Update or modify the StatsForecast package**: If you're comfortable with editing library code and this is a bug with the package, you could locally adjust the source code to handle the tiny dataset case smoothly. This could involve having a default behavior for tiny datasets, such as returning a set of \`NaN\`s or the last observed value as a forecast. This approach is more complex and would require updates each time the library is updated. If you go with this option, also consider submitting a pull request to the library's repository to contribute a fix for this issue. Be sure to consult the documentation for \`StatsForecast\` to confirm any special considerations when handling series of varying lengths.

This is purely a hypothetical scenario and not something that has been observed in our universe. planetary systems tend to follow more stable and predictable patterns of rotation due to the laws of physics."},{"prompt":"The code: \\"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np import pandas as pd import seaborn as sns import cv2 import random import tensorflow as tf import tkinter as tk from tkinter import filedialog from PIL import ImageTk, Image from ipywidgets import interact, interactive, fixed, interact_manual import ipywidgets as widgets from IPython.display import display, clear_output from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam, SGD, RMSprop, AdamW, Adadelta, Adagrad, Adamax, Adafactor, Nadam, Ftrl from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator from tqdm import tqdm import os from sklearn.utils import shuffle from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential, Model, load_model from tensorflow.keras.layers import ( GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dropout, Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dropout, BatchNormalization, Activation, concatenate, Conv2DTranspose, Input, Reshape, UpSampling2D, ) from tensorflow.keras.applications import ( EfficientNetV2B0, EfficientNetV2B1, EfficientNetV2B2, EfficientNetV2B3, EfficientNetV2L, EfficientNetV2M, EfficientNetV2S, ) from tensorflow.keras.applications import Xception from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16, VGG19 from tensorflow.keras.applications import ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, ResNetRS50, ResNetRS101 from tensorflow.keras.applications import InceptionResNetV2, ConvNeXtXLarge, ConvNeXtBase, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, NASNetLarge, NASNetMobile from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, TensorBoard, ModelCheckpoint from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix import ipywidgets as widgets import io from PIL import Image from IPython.display import display, clear_output from warnings import filterwarnings from google.colab import drive drive.mount(\\"/content/gdrive\\") def load_data(data_folders): X_data = [] #

Specifically, you need to define the loss function using \`tf.keras.losses.CategoricalFocalCrossentropy\` and use it in the \`compile\` method of your Keras model. First, let's define a custom loss function that combines focal loss for the classification output and your existing segmentation loss for the segmentation output. Replace the following lines in your \`train_model\` function: \`\`\`python model.compile( optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001), loss={\\"classification_output\\": \\"categorical_crossentropy\\", \\"segmentation_output\\": segmentation_loss}, metrics={\\"classification_output\\": \\"accuracy\\", \\"segmentation_output\\": \\"accuracy\\"}, loss_weights={\\"classification_output\\": 1, \\"segmentation_output\\": 1}, ) \`\`\` with: \`\`\`python focal_loss = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalFocalCrossentropy(alpha=0.25, gamma=2.0) model.compile( optimizer=Adam(lr=0.001), loss={\\"classification_output\\": focal_loss, \\"segmentation_output\\": segmentation_loss}, metrics={\\"classification_output\\": \\"accuracy\\", \\"segmentation_output\\": \\"accuracy\\"}, loss_weights={\\"classification_output\\": 1, \\"segmentation_output\\": 1}, ) \`\`\` You have now defined the focal loss with the default \`alpha\` and \`gamma\` values as the loss function for the classification branch. You can adjust the parameters \`alpha\` and \`gamma\` as needed for your specific problem. Also, make sure that your other model-loading or model-evaluating functions are aware of the custom loss by including custom object scopes where necessary: \`\`\`python with tf.keras.utils.custom_object_scope({'segmentation_loss': segmentation_loss, 'CategoricalFocalCrossentropy': tf.keras.losses.CategoricalFocalCrossentropy}): best_model = load_model(\\"multitask_best_weights.h5\\") \`\`\` Finally, remember to ensure that your labels are in one-hot encoded format, as \`CategoricalFocalCrossentropy\` requires one-hot encoded labels. If you don't have one-hot encoded labels, you can convert them using \`tf.keras.utils.to_categorical\`. By making these changes, your MTL model will now use focal loss for the classification output and retain the existing segmentation loss for the segmentation output."},{"prompt":"Give me 10 nice names for Natural Rutilated Quartz","completion":"Sure, here are ten creative names reflecting the beauty and character of Natural Rutilated Quartz: 1. **Golden Hair Quartz** – Highlighting the fine golden needle-like inclusions that look like strands of hair. 2. **Angel Thread Crystal** – Suggesting the ethereal appearance of the inclusions that may resemble delicate threads woven by celestial beings. 3. **Venus's Loom Stone** – Emphasizing the mythological connections to love and beauty, symbolized by Venus, weaving through the quartz. 4. **Solar Whisper Quartz** – Reflecting the sun-like radiance and fine lines that seem to whisper ancient secrets. 5. **Lightning Gold Quartz** – Referring to the streaks of rutile that resemble bolts of lightning captured in the crystal. 6. **Sunbeam Catcher Quartz** – Imagining the crystal as a catcher of warm sunlight due to the golden rutile strands. 7. **Astral Silk Gemstone** – Alluding to the silken threads of rutile within the quartz and their connection to the stars. 8. **Gilded Scepter Quartz** – Framing the stone as regal and commanding, with inclusions like golden scepters. 9. **Merlin's Mane Quartz** – Conjuring magical and mystical imagery associated with the legendary wizard whose \\"mane\\" might resemble the intricate inclusions. 10. **Starry Stratum Quartz** – Creating a vision of star-studded layers within the natural stone.

This type of movement is often seen in gymnastics, figure skating, and other acrobatic performances where athletes need to perform intricate and dynamic movements. Spinning with four axes requires a high level of coordination and balance, as the athlete must control their movements in multiple directions at the same time. This can be achieved through training and practice, as well as having a strong core and lower body strength to maintain stability during the rotation. Overall, spinning with four axes is an impressive and visually stunning skill that showcases the agility and skill of the athlete. It takes a lot of dedication and hard work to master this type of movement, but the results can be truly breathtaking to watch."},{"prompt":"Spinning planet with four axises","completion":"A spinning planet with four axes would be a unique and scientifically fascinating concept. In our solar system, planets typically rotate on one axis, causing day and night cycles as different parts of the planet are exposed to sunlight. If a planet were to somehow have four axes of rotation, it would likely experience extreme and erratic changes in its day and night cycles. The movement of the planet would be much more complex, with multiple regions experiencing sunlight and darkness at different times. This hypothetical planet would probably have a very irregular climate and weather patterns, as different parts of the planet would receive varying amounts of sunlight and heat depending on the orientation of its axes. It is difficult to predict exactly how life would evolve and adapt on such a planet, but it would certainly present some interesting challenges for any inhabitants. Overall, the idea of a spinning planet with four axes is a fascinating concept that pushes the boundaries of our understanding of planetary motion and the potential diversity of worlds in the universe."},{"prompt":"How have developments in technology affected employment in your country(Iran)? answer with 80 to 110 words as you are in a speaking IELTS test.","completion":"Technological advancements have significantly transformed the employment landscape in Iran.

Execute \`RunMyProg.bat\` by double-clicking it or running it from a command prompt. Please note that \`start /wait\` usually waits for the program to terminate, but in situations where the program may launch another window or process and returns immediately, you may need to adjust the script to monitor the process by its executable name. This script takes that possibility into account. Also, be aware that batch scripting's timing accuracy is limited because it depends on the \`%time%\` environment variable, which has a resolution of 0.01 seconds and is affected by the system's clock format settings. If you need higher precision or a different timing method, consider using PowerShell or another scripting language with more advanced features."},{"prompt":"do the same with the help of powershell to run MyProg and handle termination if not finished in time","completion":"To achieve this using PowerShell instead of a batch file, you can employ a more powerful set of cmdlets along with tasks and jobs.

Given the complexity of the time-limit enforcement and termination, PowerShell is better suited for this task than a traditional batch script alone. Here's how you could do it with a batch file invoking an inline PowerShell script: 1. Create a new text file with a \`.bat\` extension (e.g., \`RunMyProg.bat\`). 2. Copy and paste the following code into your newly created batch file: \`\`\`batch @echo off PowerShell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command \\"& { start_time = Get-Date process = Start-Process 'MyProg.exe' -PassThru time_limit = [TimeSpan]::FromSeconds(1000) do { if ((Get-Date) - start_time -gt time_limit) { process | Stop-Process -Force Write-Warning 'MyProg.exe exceeded the time limit of 1000 seconds and was terminated.' exit } Start-Sleep -Seconds 3 } while (!process.HasExited) end_time = Get-Date duration = end_time - start_time Write-Host \\"Elapsed time: (duration.ToString('hh:mm:ss'))\\" }\\" \`\`\` Here's what the script does step by step: - It launches PowerShell with a command script block. - It records the current time as a start time. - It starts \`MyProg.exe\` using \`Start-Process\` and keeps a reference to it (\`process\`). - It enters a loop where it sleeps for 3 seconds between checks if the process has exited. - If the time limit of 1000 seconds has been exceeded, it forcefully stops the process and prints a warning. - Once the process has exited or has been stopped, it calculates and prints the elapsed time. To run this batch file, save it and simply execute it by double-clicking the file or running it from the command line. Please remember to place \`MyProg.exe\` in the same directory as the batch script or provide a full path to the executable if it's located elsewhere. **Note:** When dealing with PowerShell execution policies, you may need sufficient permissions to execute scripts. The \`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass\` flag is used in the batch file to bypass the policy for this script block without changing the system's policy settings. However, if you're running this on a machine with strict policies, you may need to adjust the execution policy or run the script as an administrator. Additionally, ensure that \`MyProg.exe\` doesn't require user interaction, as it will be executed without a user interface to interact with."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here's what the script does: - \`@echo off\`: Prevents the command prompt from displaying the commands being executed, providing a cleaner output. - \`SET \\"exePath=MyProg.exe\\"\`: Sets the variable \`exePath\` to the location of the \`MyProg.exe\` file. - The PowerShell script is invoked by \`powershell -Command \\"& {...}\\"\`: - \`Start-Process\` is used to start \`MyProg.exe\` and the \`-PassThru\` parameter returns a process object. - A \`Stopwatch\` object is created to track the execution time. - A \`while\` loop checks if the process has exited; it continues to check every second until the process exits or exceeds the 1000-second limit. - If the process exceeds the time limit, it is forcibly terminated using \`Stop-Process -Force\`. - The elapsed time is output using \`Write-Output\` if the process completed without exceeding the time limit. To run your batch file, simply double-click on it or execute it from the command prompt. This batch file assumes that \`MyProg.exe\` is in the current directory; otherwise, you'll need to specify the full path."},{"prompt":"Depict map of tidally locked gas giant look like","completion":"A map of a tidally locked gas giant would show a stark contrast between the permanently sunlit side and the permanently dark side. On the sunlit side, the map would show swirling bands of clouds, intense storms, and possibly large, bright features like gas giant storms or super storms. The dark side would be shown as a barren, icy wasteland, with no sunlight to warm the surface. The map might also show the movement of moons or other objects orbiting the gas giant, illustrating their paths in relation to the permanent day-night boundary."},{"prompt":"Do tidally locked gas giant have big cyclone in centre of map?","completion":"It is possible for a tidally-locked gas giant to have a large cyclone at the center of the map, particularly on the sunlit side where heat and energy are constantly being absorbed. Gas giants are known for their turbulent atmospheres and swirling storms, so it is not uncommon for massive cyclones or storms to form on these planets. However, the exact location of such a cyclone may vary and it may not necessarily be located at the center of the map. The dynamics and weather patterns on gas giants are complex and can be influenced by many factors, including the planet's rotation and tilt, the presence of other storms or atmospheric features, and the amount of heat being received from the planet's star. In general, gas giants tend to have multiple storm systems and weather patterns across their surface, so a map of a tidally-locked gas giant may show a variety of different storms and cyclones at different locations."},{"prompt":"traduit en francais: He has very poor EN skills, good technical background, salary expectations around 40 k/annually, overall, not as strong profile as some previous candidates I screened","completion":"Il a des compétences en anglais très faibles, une bonne expérience technique, des attentes salariales d'environ 40 000 par an, dans l'ensemble, un profil moins solide que certains candidats précédents que j'ai filtrés."},{"prompt":"rewrite this message for networking: Hi Keith, happy to connect, I see that we are both successful Leader TA managers.

issue where the \`Match\` model does not have an attribute \`idPoule\`, which is causing an \`AttributeError\` in your Flask application. The traceback indicates that the error is occurring in your \`get_match\` function in \`models.py\`. Let's take a closer look at the relevant parts of your model definitions and code to identify the cause of this error and provide a solution. In the \`Match\` model, there is no column defined with the name \`idPoule\`, which is consistent with the error message you're seeing. It's possible that you missed defining this attribute in the \`Match\` class, or you intended to use a different attribute name or method to access this information. To resolve the issue, you'll need to: 1. Check the design of your database schema to confirm if there should be a column \`idPoule\` in the \`Match\` table or if the relationship between \`Match\` and \`Poule\` is made through another attribute or a relationship table. 2. If \`idPoule\` should be an attribute of \`Match\`, then you need to add it to the \`Match\` model definition. An example of this column addition might look like this: \`\`\`python class Match(db.Model): __tablename__ = 'MATCH' # ... other columns ... idPoule = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('POULE.idPoule')) # ... other columns ... # Relationship to Poule poule = db.relationship('Poule', backref='matches', foreign_keys=[idPoule]) \`\`\` 3. If the relation between \`Match\` and \`Poule\` is through another attribute or a relationship table (e.g., \`Contenir\`), then you need to use that attribute or table to fetch the associated \`Poule\` ID for a \`Match\`. 4. Update the \`get_match\` function to correctly join \`Match\` with \`Poule\` using the corrected attribute or relationship. If your traceback originates from calling \`get_match(match.numeroLicenceE1, match.numeroLicenceE2, num_poule, id_comp)\`, ensure that you pass the correct identifiers for the two tireurs (fencers), the poule number, and the competition id. You'll need to adjust the \`get_match\` function to correctly filter \`Match\` instances based on these parameters. Please make the necessary changes according to your application schema and logic, and then re-run your application to see if the issue has been resolved. Remember to adjust any other parts of your code that may depend on the \`idPoule\` attribute in the \`Match\` model to reflect the changes you've made."},{"prompt":"J'ai maintenant la table contenir pour lier les match à une une compétition et une poule","completion":"If you have introduced a new association table \`Contenir\` to link the \`Match\` with a \`Competition\` and a \`Poule\`, then you would need to update your \`get_match\` function to accommodate this new structure. Basically, you will need to perform a join that brings together the \`Match\`, \`Contenir\`, and \`Poule\` tables to find the match based on the tireurs' numbers, poule number, and competition ID. Here's how you can modify your \`get_match\` function to use the \`Contenir\` association table: \`\`\`python def get_match(tireur1, tireur2, id_poule, id_comp): \\"\\"\\"Return the match instance for two given tireurs within a specific poule and competition.\\"\\"\\" # Use the Contenir table to join the Match and Poule. # Make sure that the match is between the specified tireurs (tireur1 and tireur2) # and within the specified poule and competition. match = db.session.query(Match).join( Contenir, Match.idMatch == Contenir.idMatch ).filter( Contenir.idPoule == id_poule, Contenir.idComp == id_comp, or_( (Match.numeroLicenceE1 == tireur1) & (Match.numeroLicenceE2 == tireur2), (Match.numeroLicenceE1 == tireur2) & (Match.numeroLicenceE2 == tireur1) ) ).first() return match \`\`\` This updated function should resolve the \`AttributeError\`, assuming that you have the correct columns and foreign keys set up in your \`Contenir\` and other related models. Make sure that the \`idPoule\` and \`idComp\` columns exist in the \`Poule\` and \`Competition\` tables, respectively, and that your \`Contenir\` table is set up with the necessary foreign key relationships. After changing the function, ensure you also update any part of the code where \`get_match\` is called, passing the correct parameters. Additionally, verify that the rest of your codebase is consistent with these changes, particularly in areas where you are manipulating or accessing matches related to poules and competitions."},{"prompt":"le problème c'est que j'ai ajouté la table contenir après avoir fait les poules ect... regarde dans le route flask pour les poules pour mettre à jour contenir :

and the matches are generated, you are recording the appropriate relationships in the \`Contenir\` table. Here’s how you can modify the route to take into account the \`Contenir\` table when creating poules and matches: 1. Modify your match creation process to include the step of populating the \`Contenir\` table after the matches have been generated. 2. Ensure that the \`gestion_poules\` function includes logic to handle the insertion of records into the \`Contenir\` table. Below is an overview of what the code could look like (please note this is not the complete function, only a guide of what needs attention): \`\`\`python @app.route('/gestion_poules/<int:id_comp>', methods=[\\"GET\\", \\"POST\\"]) def gestion_poules(id_comp): # ... # Your existing logic for handling poules and matches creation. # ... if request.method == \\"POST\\": # Handling POST request logic # ... # Assume you have called a function that generates the matches # Use the session or other means to retrieve poules, arbitres, and pistes information. # You might already be doing this. If so, you will need to modify to use the Contenir table. # For example, if you store poules info in session after creation: liste_poules_session_info = session.get(\\"liste_poules\\") # Now loop through each poule and its matches and populate the Contenir table for poule_idx, poule in enumerate(liste_poules_session_info): id_poule = # Retrieve or generate the Poule ID for match_info in poule: # Retrieve match ID match_id = match_info['match_id'] # replace with appropriate attribute # Insert into Contenir new_contenir_entry = Contenir(idPoule=id_poule, idMatch=match_id, idComp=id_comp) db.session.add(new_contenir_entry) # Don’t forget to commit your database session db.session.commit() # ... # Remaining route logic # ... \`\`\` Please note that this code is meant to guide you toward the solution—it may not be complete or fully adapted to your project's specific details. You need to adjust the logic and variables to fit your exact functions and data structures, particularly how you are handling poule and match creation and storing their information. When running this updated code, you should see new entries in the \`Contenir\` table reflecting the relationships between the \`Match\`, \`Poule\`, and \`Competition\` tables for the generated matches of the poules. Additionally, ensure that when retrieving information about matches (for example in the \`get_matchs_poules\` function), you are correctly joining with the \`Contenir\` table and filtering based on the \`idPoule\` and \`idComp\`. The example code given at the end of your message already seems to consider \`Contenir\` when fetching matches, which is good. Remember to test these changes fully to ensure that everything works as expected and to ensure that the presence of the new \`Contenir\` table is correctly integrated into the logic of your application."},{"prompt":"affiche moi le code en entier avec les modificatoins : @app.route('/gestion_poules/<int:id_comp>', methods=[\\"GET\\", \\"POST\\"]) def gestion_poules(id_comp): liste_poules = [] nb_tireurs = get_nb_tireurs(id_comp) nb_arbitres = get_nb_arbitres(id_comp) nb_tireurs_par_poule = nb_tireurs // nb_arbitres liste_matchs = [] if request.method == \\"POST\\": classement_checked = 'classement' in request.form club_checked = 'club' in request.form equilibrer_checked = 'equilibrer' in request.form nb_poules = request.form.get('nb_poules') nb_tireurs_poules_str = request.form.get('nb_tireurs/poules') if nb_tireurs_poules_str and nb_tireurs_poules_str.isdigit(): nb_tireurs_poules = int(nb_tireurs_poules_str) liste_tireurs = get_liste_participants_competitions_tireurs(id_comp) liste_arbitres = get_liste_participants_competitions_arbitres(id_comp) liste_pistes = get_liste_pistes_selon_nb_arbitres(id_comp, nb_arbitres) i = len(liste_pistes) while i < nb_arbitres: nouvelle_piste = ajouter_piste(id_comp, f\\"Piste {i+1}\\", True) i += 1 liste_pistes = get_liste_pistes_selon_nb_arbitres(id_comp, nb_arbitres) nb_tireurs_par_poule = nb_tireurs // nb_arbitres numero_licence_arbitre = request.form.get('numero_licence_arbitre') id_arbitre = get_id_arbitre_from_escrimeur(numero_licence_arbitre) if classement_checked: liste_tireurs = classer_tireurs(liste_tireurs) if poules_fabriquables(liste_tireurs, liste_arbitres): liste_poules = fabriquer_poules(liste_tireurs, liste_arbitres, liste_pistes, \\"Classement\\") elif club_checked: if poules_fabriquables(liste_tireurs, liste_arbitres): liste_poules = fabriquer_poules(liste_tireurs, liste_arbitres, liste_pistes, \\"Club\\") session[\\"liste_poules\\"] = [ [escrimeur[0].numeroLicenceE for escrimeur in poule] for poule in liste_poules] session[\\"liste_arbitres\\"] = [arbitre.numeroLicenceE for arbitre in liste_arbitres] session[\\"liste_pistes\\"] = [piste.idPiste for piste in liste_pistes] return render_template('gestion_poules.html', id_comp=id_comp, nb_tireurs=get_nb_tireurs(id_comp), nb_arbitres=get_nb_arbitres(id_comp), liste_tireurs=liste_tireurs, liste_arbitres=liste_arbitres, liste_poules=liste_poules, nb_tireurs_par_poule=nb_tireurs_par_poule, liste_pistes=liste_pistes) liste_tireurs = get_liste_participants_competitions_tireurs(id_comp) liste_arbitres = get_liste_participants_competitions_arbitres(id_comp) liste_pistes = get_liste_pistes_selon_nb_arbitres(id_comp, nb_arbitres) competition = Competition.query.get(id_comp) if competition is not None: return render_template('gestion_poules.html', id_comp=id_comp, nb_tireurs=nb_tireurs, nb_arbitres=nb_arbitres, liste_tireurs=liste_tireurs, liste_arbitres=liste_arbitres, liste_poules=liste_poules, nb_tireurs_par_poule=nb_tireurs_par_poule, liste_pistes=liste_pistes)","completion":"Based on your existing route for \`gestion_poules\`, here's how you can integrate the \`Contenir\` table when creating poules and generating matches.

them to a competition using the \`Contenir\` table. However, since the code for creating the matches and poules is not given, I'll show you where in your function you should insert the logic for adding entries to the \`Contenir\` table. You will need to adapt and complete this code to fit the details of your match creation logic. Here is the updated \`gestion_poules\` route incorporating the \`Contenir\` table handling: \`\`\`python from flask import request, session, render_template, redirect, url_for from .app import db from .models import Contenir, Competition, ParticipantsCompetition, Arbitre, Tireur, Match, Poule # Assume the following fictitious functions for illustration: # - create_and_save_matches: creates matches and returns match ids # - create_and_save_poule: creates a poule and returns its id @app.route('/gestion_poules/<int:id_comp>', methods=[\\"GET\\", \\"POST\\"]) def gestion_poules(id_comp): # ... Your existing initialization and setup ... if request.method == \\"POST\\": # Your form handling and poules/matches generation logic here: # ... # Assume your application has some way to create poules and matches, and now you need to store them in the Contenir table. # For each generated poule, you need to store its id (after creation) and then use it to link matches: poules_info = [] # Assume this is a list of instantiated Poule objects already added to the db session for poule in poules_info: # Save the poule and get its ID db.session.add(poule) db.session.commit() poule_id = poule.idPoule # Create matches for this poule matches_info = create_and_save_matches(poule) # Assume this function creates and saves matches for match_id in matches_info: # Create a Contenir link for each Match contenir_entry = Contenir(idPoule=poule_id, idMatch=match_id, idComp=id_comp) db.session.add(contenir_entry) db.session.commit() # Now that the \`Contenir\` table is populated, redirect to the current page to prevent form resubmission issues return redirect(url_for('gestion_poules', id_comp=id_comp)) # Your existing logic for GET request handling and initial rendering of gestion_poules: # ... return render_template('gestion_poules.html', ...) # You need to define or adjust the functions used above to create and save matches. # The implementation details here are substantial and would require a solid understanding # of your match generation logic, which you would need to provide. \`\`\` The major change here is that after creating each poule and its matches, you create \`Contenir\` entries to link the matches to their respective poule and competition. Keep in mind that \`create_and_save_matches\` and \`create_and_save_poule\` are placeholder functions; you need to replace them with your actual logic for creating matches and poules. Remember to add these entries to the database and commit the session to save the changes. Please adjust and fill in the missing pieces according to your application's flow and operations.

generating the poules and their respective matches: 1. Creating poules in the database and retrieving their IDs. 2. Creating matches for each poule. 3. Creating records in the \`Contenir\` table linking each match to the corresponding poule and competition. The \`fabriquer_poules\` function appears to handle poule generation but does not handle actual database operations. Let's modify the route so that the poules and matches generated with \`fabriquer_poules\` are inserted into the database, and relationships are created in the \`Contenir\` table. \`\`\`python from flask import request, session, render_template, redirect, url_for from .app import db from .models import Contenir, Match, Poule @app.route('/gestion_poules/<int:id_comp>', methods=[\\"GET\\", \\"POST\\"]) def gestion_poules(id_comp): # ...

If \`liste_poules\` only contains IDs or references, you will need logic that fetches or generates the rest of the data required for database operations. The key addition here is that after generating each poule and its matches, you also create records in the \`Contenir\` table that relate poules, matches, and the competition. Please fill in the \\"...\\" with the appropriate attributes and logic from your application to ensure correct population and creation of \`Poule\` and \`Match\` instances.

The \`db.session.add()\` and \`db.session.commit()\` statements will save these entities to the database and allow you to retrieve their IDs for use in the \`Contenir\` table. This approach assumes that \`ajouter_poule\` and \`ajouter_match\` are functions that perform the database operations. If these functions currently do not handle database transactions, this logic will need to be integrated into them. The \`ajouter_match\` function (not shown here) should include similar logic to add the match to the \`MATCH\` table and then associate the match with the \`idPoule\` and \`idComp\` in the \`Contenir\` table. Please note that it is essential to check for the existence of poules and matches in the database before adding new ones to ensure you do not create duplicates. This is not shown in the code above. The \`db.session.commit()\` should be called once after all the entities of a logical unit (such as a poule and its matches) are added to the session for efficiency and to maintain transaction integrity."},{"prompt":"le problème c'est que moi j'utilise ajouter_match ducoup je n'ai pas d('attribut match pour pouvoir le donner a contenir @app.route(\\"/appel/<int:id_comp>\\", methods=[\\"GET\\", \\"POST\\"]) def appel(id_comp): rows_data = [] participants_present = [] if request.method == \\"POST\\": pistes = session.get(\\"liste_pistes\\") arbitres = session.get(\\"liste_arbitres\\") liste_poules = session.get(\\"liste_poules\\") try: for i in range(len(liste_poules)): num_licence_arbitre = arbitres[i] id_arbitre = get_id_arbitre_from_escrimeur(num_licence_arbitre) nom_poule = f\\"Poule {i+1}\\" id_piste = pistes[i] ajouter_poule(id_comp, id_piste, id_arbitre, nom_poule) id_poule = get_id_poule(id_comp, id_piste, id_arbitre, nom_poule) for j in range(1, len(liste_poules[i])): ajouter_participant_poule(id_poule, liste_poules[i][j], id_comp) tireur = Tireur.query.get(liste_poules[i][j]) rows_data.append(tireur.to_dict()) id_type_match = 1 date_match = datetime.date.today() date_match_str = date_match.strftime(\\"%Y-%m-%d\\") heure_match = datetime.datetime.now().time().strftime(\\"%H:%M:%S\\") for i in range(len(liste_poules)): poule = liste_poules[i] id_piste = pistes[i] id_arbitre = get_id_arbitre_from_escrimeur(arbitres[i]) for j in range(len(poule)): for k in range(j+1, len(poule)): numero_licence_e1 = poule[j] numero_licence_e2 = poule[k] ajouter_match(id_type_match, id_piste, id_arbitre, numero_licence_e1, numero_licence_e2, date_match_str, heure_match, 0, 0, 0, 0) contenir = Contenir(idPoule=id_poule, idComp=id_comp, idMatch=match.idMatch) db.session.add(contenir) redirect(url_for('appel', id_comp=id_comp)) competition = Competition.query.get(id_comp) return render_template('appel.html', competition = competition, rows_data=rows_data, participants_present=participants_present) except Exception as e: print(e) competition = Competition.query.get(id_comp) if competition is not None: rows_data = [] participants_comp = get_liste_participants_competitions(id_comp) participants_comp = get_liste_participants_competitions(id_comp) for participant in participants_comp: dict_tireur = participant.tireur.to_dict() rows_data.append(dict_tireur) participants_present = [] return render_template('appel.html', competition = competition, rows_data=rows_data, participants_present=participants_present) def ajouter_match(idTypeMatch, idPiste, idArbitre, numeroLicenceE1, numeroLicenceE2, dateMatch, heureMatch, toucheRecuTireur1, toucheDonnerTireur1, toucheRecuTireur2, toucheDonnerTireur2): try: idTypeMatch = int(idTypeMatch) idPiste = int(idPiste) idArbitre = int(idArbitre) numeroLicenceE1 = int(numeroLicenceE1) numeroLicenceE2 = int(numeroLicenceE2) toucheRecuTireur1 = int(toucheRecuTireur1) toucheDonnerTireur1 = int(toucheDonnerTireur1) toucheRecuTireur2 = int(toucheRecuTireur2) toucheDonnerTireur2 = int(toucheDonnerTireur2) dateMatch = datetime.strptime(dateMatch, \\"%Y-%m-%d\\").date() heureMatch = datetime.strptime(heureMatch, \\"%H:%M:%S\\").time() # Vérifiez si le match poule existe match_existe = ( Match.query .filter_by( idTypeMatch=idTypeMatch, idPiste=idPiste, idArbitre=idArbitre, numeroLicenceE1=numeroLicenceE1, numeroLicenceE2=numeroLicenceE2 ) .first() ) if not match_existe: # Si le match poule n'existe pas, ajoutez-le à la base de données match = Match( type_match=idTypeMatch, piste=idPiste, arbitre=idArbitre, tireur1=numeroLicenceE1, tireur2=numeroLicenceE2, date_match=dateMatch, heure_match=heureMatch, touches_recues_tireur1=toucheRecuTireur1, touches_donnees_tireur1=toucheDonnerTireur1, touches_recues_tireur2=toucheRecuTireur2, touches_donnees_tireur2=toucheDonnerTireur2 ) db.session.add(match) db.session.commit() return f\\"Le match poule {idTypeMatch} a été ajouté avec succès.\\" else: return f\\"Le match poule {idTypeMatch} existe déjà.\\" except ValueError: return \\"Assurez-vous que les valeurs numériques sont correctes.\\" except IntegrityError: db.session.rollback() return f\\"Le match poule {idTypeMatch} existe déjà.\\" except Exception as e: db.session.rollback() return f\\"Une erreur s'est produite lors de l'ajout du match poule : {str(e)}\\"","completion":"If the \`ajouter_match\` function creates match entries directly in the database without returning the Match instance or ID, you'll need to modify it to return the ID of the created match.

This ensures you are not getting tireurs from poules with the same \`idPoule\` across different competitions.

SQL query you provided should only return tireurs from a specific poule (\`idPoule = 1\`) of a specific competition (\`idComp = 22\`): \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM escrimeur JOIN tireur ON escrimeur.numeroLicenceE = tireur.numeroLicenceE JOIN participants_poule ON tireur.numeroLicenceE = participants_poule.numeroLicenceE JOIN poule ON participants_poule.idPoule = poule.idPoule WHERE poule.idComp = 22 AND poule.idPoule = 1; \`\`\` However, in the results you provided, there are rows with \`idComp = 1\`, which is unexpected given your \`WHERE\` clause that specifies \`idComp = 22\`. This indicates there might be an issue in the database schema, the data itself, or the database engine's query execution. Here are a few things to check: 1. **Data Integrity**: Ensure that your data is correct and consistent. There should be no situations where a \`poule.idComp\` does not correspond to the competition it's meant to be part of. 2. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Validate that proper foreign key constraints are in place in your database to maintain referential integrity between tables. 3. **Query Execution**: Make sure there are no views, functions, or stored procedures that might be altering the results you get from this query. 4. **Database Engine Behavior**: Different database engines might have specific behavior or optimizations that could lead to unexpected results. Check the engine's documentation if it's related. 5. **Aliases**: If the column names are ambiguous when joining multiple tables, use aliases to make sure the right columns are being used in the \`WHERE\` clause. 6. **Testing**: Run a simpler version of the query, gradually adding joins to pinpoint where the unexpected data starts to appear. Try running the following simple query to ensure that only the poules data for \`idComp = 22\` is selected: \`\`\`sql SELECT * FROM poule WHERE idComp = 22; \`\`\` If this query returns more than just \`idComp = 22\`, then there's definitely an issue with your data or table structure. If this query returns the correct results, then there's likely an issue with your joins in the larger query. Check for the same \`idPoule\` in different competitions and ensure they're related properly. Make sure to use explicit JOIN conditions that include both the poule ID and competition ID as the foreign key relationship, and you can further investigate schema issues by looking at the respective table creation and foreign key enforcement definitions."},{"prompt":"voici ce que me renvoie le print de scores, il y'a des répétitions inutiles non ? 201224): {'touchesDonneesTireur1': 0,

\`id_comp\`. A query like this should ideally return tireurs associated with a specific \`id_poule\` within a specific \`id_comp\`. The issue might be arising due to the join conditions that do not adequately restrict the results to the specific competition. It appears that the relationships between \`Escrimeur\`, \`Tireur\`, \`ParticipantsPoule\`, and \`Poule\` are set up correctly, but the problem seems to be with how the constraints are being applied in the query itself. Assuming that \`idPoule\` is a unique identifier only within a single competition (i.e., poule ID 1 exists in multiple competitions), you need to ensure that the join between \`ParticipantsPoule\` and \`Poule\` takes the competition ID into account. However, it looks like the current join condition between \`ParticipantsPoule\` and \`Poule\` doesn't constrain the competition ID, which could be causing the issue. The corrected function to retrieve tireurs from a specific poule and competition should involve a join that associates \`ParticipantsPoule\` with \`Poule\`, and filters by both \`idPoule\` and \`idComp\`: \`\`\`python def get_liste_tireurs_escrimeurs_poule(id_comp, id_poule): return Escrimeur.query.join( Tireur, Escrimeur.numeroLicenceE == Tireur.numeroLicenceE ).join( ParticipantsPoule, and_(Tireur.numeroLicenceE == ParticipantsPoule.numeroLicenceE, ParticipantsPoule.idComp == id_comp) ).join( Poule, and_(ParticipantsPoule.idPoule == Poule.idPoule, Poule.idComp == id_comp) ).filter( Poule.idPoule == id_poule ).all() \`\`\` This ensures that the join operation respects both the poule ID and the competition ID, thus preventing the retrieval of tireurs from other competitions with the same poule ID. If you are still experiencing issues, make sure that the database schema correctly reflects the intended relationships and constraints, and that \`idComp\` and \`idPoule\` form a unique association for each poule within a competition. It might be beneficial to review the schema definition for \`ParticipantsPoule\`, \`Poule\`, \`Contenir\`, and other related tables to ensure that the primary and foreign keys are set up correctly."},{"prompt":"pourquoi seulTouchesRecusTireur1 est mit à jour : {% extends 'base.html' %} {% block content %} <link rel=\\"stylesheet\\" href=\\"{{ url_for('static', filename =

Dans votre fonction \`update_scores\`, la ligne suivante doit être corrigée : \`\`\`python # Ceci est incorrect car 'toucheDonneesTireur2' et 'touchesRecuesTireur1' sont des fautes de frappe. else: match.toucheDonneesTireur2 = score # Faute de frappe ici, devrait être \`touchesDonneesTireur2\` match.touchesRecuesTireur1 = score # Ce score ne doit pas être mis à jour ici. \`\`\` Les correctifs devraient être : \`\`\`python if match: if match.numeroLicenceE1 == licence: match.touchesDonneesTireur1 = score # Tireur 1 a donné des touches match.touchesRecuesTireur2 = score # Tireur 2 a reçu des touches else: match.touchesDonneesTireur2 = score # Tireur 2 a donné des touches match.touchesRecuesTireur1 = score # Tireur 1 a reçu les touches # Définir le gagnant si le score est 5 # ... \`\`\` En résumé, vous devez vous assurer que les noms des attributs correspondent exactement à ceux de votre modèle \`Match\`, et les scores doivent être mis à jour pour le tireur approprié. Par ailleurs, veuillez noter que dans votre condition \`if score == 5:\`, la variable \`license\` dans \`match.gagnant = license\` semble être une faute de frappe et doit être remplacée par \`licence\`. Aussi, veillez à ce que cette logique soit correcte, car si \`score == 5\`, il n'est pas automatiquement le gagnant à moins que le type de match ne le spécifie (par exemple, un match peut être gagné par deux touches d'avance). Les scores pour chaque match entre les tireurs doivent être gérés en respectant le tireur qui a donné les touches (touches données) et celui qui les a reçues (touches reçues), donc vous avez raison de penser qu'il y a des répétitions, car les informations pour les touches données par l'un doivent correspondre aux touches reçues par l'autre et vice versa. Pour chaque paire (A, B), on pourrait n'enregistrer que \`(A, B): {'touchesDonnees': X, 'touchesRecues': Y}\` et récupérer les données pour \`(B, A)\` en consultant le même dictionnaire avec les rôles inversés, au lieu d'enregistrer à la fois \`(A, B)\` et \`(B, A)\` dans votre dictionnaire \`scores\`."},{"prompt":"met l'initale de prenomE et nomE des escrimeurs dans les colonnes de la matrice : {%
