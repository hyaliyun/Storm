What is the ratio of the number of blue beads to the number of purple beads?","completion":"Let's denote the number of blue beads as B and the number of green beads as G. According to the information given: 1. Sue has 7 purple beads. 2. There are 11 more green beads than blue beads, so G = B + 11. 3. The total number of beads in the necklace is 46. We can set up an equation to find the number of blue beads (B): Number of purple beads + Number of blue beads + Number of green beads = Total number of beads 7 + B + (B + 11) = 46 Combine like terms: 7 + 2B + 11 = 46 2B + 18 = 46 Subtract 18 from both sides: 2B = 46 - 18 2B = 28 Divide both sides by 2 to find B: B = 28 / 2 B = 14 So, there are 14 blue beads. Now, we can find the ratio of the number of blue beads to the number of purple beads: Number of blue beads : Number of purple beads 14 : 7 This ratio can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 7: (14 / 7) : (7 / 7) 2 : 1 Therefore, the ratio of the number of blue beads to the number of purple beads is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"The price of TV sets in a shop is increased by 90% but as a result, their sale decreases by 30%.

However, the sales decrease by 30%, so the new number of units sold is S - 0.3S = 0.7S. New revenue (without loyalty discount or sales tax) = New price × New quantity sold = 1.9P times 0.7S = 1.33PS Now, for old customers, there is a 10% loyalty discount on the increased price. The discounted price for old customers is 1.9P - 0.1 times 1.9P = 1.9P times (1 - 0.1) = 1.9P times 0.9 = 1.71P.

By breaking ( 256 ) into factors, we can combine multiple palindromic multiplications without carrying over digits. - For instance, multiplication sequences: [ 11 cdot 101 cdot text{(combinations of palindromes with groups of zeros)} ldots = 1_{256} ] 6. **Ensuring No Carryover**: - If multiplication of palindromic numbers does not result in any carryover of digits, the product itself remains a palindrome. - Check combinations of integers that fit this condition and ensure they multiply cleanly. 7. **Conclusion**: - Possible breakup for high factor counts yields ( 128 ) distinct ways by factoring and multiplication. - Based on prime factorization and the structure of palindromic sequences, ( 256 ) - this is divisible sufficiently to allow over 100 distinct factorizations into palindromes. boxed{1_{256}}"},{"prompt":"w many triangles with the prime factors of 1995 as side lengths are there in total?

This is a consequence of the equidistribution theorem for irrational rotations on the unit interval. 5. **Implication of density**: Because {n log_{10}(1987)} is dense in [0, 1], for any finite sequence of digits, there exists some n such that the decimal representation of 1987^n contains that sequence of digits. This means that the sequence of digits in alpha is not periodic, as we can always find new digits appearing in the decimal expansion of 1987^n for sufficiently large n. 6. **Conclusion**: Since the decimal representation of alpha is not periodic, alpha cannot be rational.

Thus: [ vec{G} cdot 4vec{G} = (vec{A} + vec{B} + vec{C} + vec{D}) cdot vec{G} = 4 vec{G}^2 ] - Substituting back into our original expression: [ GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 + GD^2 = 4 vec{G}^2 + 4R^2 - 2vec{G} cdot 4vec{G} = 4(R^2 - vec{G}^2) ] 5. **Application of AM-GM inequality** - By Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) Inequality: [ GA^2 cdot GB^2 cdot GC^2 cdot GD^2 leq left( frac{GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 + GD^2}{4} right)^4 = left( R^2 - vec{G}^2 right)^4 ] - Since ( vec{G} ) lies inside the sphere, we have: [ GA cdot GA' = R^2 - vec{G}^2 ] - Therefore, we can express: [ (R^2 - vec{G}^2)^4 = (GA cdot GB cdot GC cdot GD)(GA' cdot GB' cdot GC' cdot GD') ] - Hence: [ GA cdot GB cdot GC cdot GD leq GA' cdot GB' cdot GC' cdot GD' ] Thus, the first inequality is shown: [ GA cdot GB cdot GC cdot GD leq GA' cdot GB' cdot GC' cdot GD' ] 6. **Application of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality** - By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: [ (GA cdot 1 + GB cdot 1 + GC cdot 1 + GD cdot 1)^2 leq (GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 + GD^2)(1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2) ] - Simplifying this: [ 16 leq (GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 + GD^2)(1 + 1 + 1 + 1) ] - Meaning: [ 16 leq 4(GA^2 + GB^2 + GC^2 + GD^2) ] 7. **Combining inequalities** - Consider: [ 1/GA + 1/GB + 1/GC + 1/GC geq frac{GA + GB + GC + GD}{R^2 - vec{G}^2} ] - Thus proving the second inequality: [ 1/GA + 1/GB + 1/GC + 1/GD geq 1/GA' + 1/GB' + 1/GC' + 1/GD' ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{ GA cdot GB cdot GC cdot GD leq GA' cdot GB' cdot GC' cdot GD' 1/GA + 1/GB + 1/GC + 1/GD geq 1/GA' + 1/GB' + 1/GC' + 1/GD' } ]"},{"prompt":"Two similar right triangles have areas of 18 square inches and 288 square inches respectively.

Calculate the area scaling factor: [ frac{288}{18} = 16 ] 2. If the side lengths of the larger triangle are scaled by sqrt{16} = 4 times those of the smaller triangle, then let's determine sides for the smaller triangle: - Since the smaller triangle must fit the area 18 square inches: [ frac{ab}{2} = 18 rightarrow ab = 36 ] - We also have the Pythagorean Theorem: [ a^2 + b^2 = 9^2 = 81 ] Solve the system: [ a^2 + b^2 = 81 ] [ ab = 36 ] Guess the common smaller legs fitting a typical triplet, try a=6 and b=3, check: [ 6^2 + 3^2 = 36 + 9 = 45 ] (incorrect for our demand).

Let's first check the divisibility rule for 9: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. Let's apply this rule to the number A4461B: A + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + B = A + B + 15 For the sum to be a multiple of 9, A + B + 15 must be divisible by 9. The smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 15 is 18, but since A and B are digits, their maximum sum is 9 + 9 = 18. Therefore, A + B + 15 must be at least 18 and at most 27 (the next multiple of 9). Since 15 is already a part of the sum, A + B must be 3 (to make the sum 18) or 12 (to make the sum 27). Now let's check the divisibility rule for 8: A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8. Let's apply this rule to the number A4461B: The last three digits are 61B. We need to find a value for B such that 61B is divisible by 8. Let's try the possible values for B (0 to 9) and see which one makes 61B divisible by 8: 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619 Out of these, 616 is divisible by 8 (since 8 * 77 = 616). Therefore, B must be 6. Now we know B = 6, let's find A: If A + B + 15 must be 18 or 27, and B is 6, then A + 6 + 15 must be 18 or 27. For the sum to be 18: A + 6 + 15 = 18 A + 21 = 18 A = 18 - 21 A = -3 (which is not possible since A is a digit) For the sum to be 27: A + 6 + 15 = 27 A + 21 = 27 A = 27 - 21 A = 6 So, A is also 6.

Since the speed of the car increases by 2 km/h after every hour, the distance traveled in each subsequent hour will be ( x + 2 ), ( x + 4 ), ( x + 6 ), and so on. The total distance traveled in 12 hours will be the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is ( x ) and the common difference is 2. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: [ S_n = frac{n}{2} times (2a + (n - 1)d) ] where ( S_n ) is the sum of the first ( n ) terms, ( a ) is the first term, ( n ) is the number of terms, and ( d ) is the common difference.

Then, we proceed similarly by removing digits ( a_{ell+2}, ldots, a_{v} ) and ensuring ( a_{v+1} = a_{n+2} ), continuing this indefinitely. 5. **Reconstruct the number:** By performing the steps described, each time we eliminate at least one decimal digit but maintain the overall decimal sequence eventually: [ A = [A], a_1 a_2 a_3 ldots a_n a_{n+1} ldots ] 6. **Conclusion:** The process described implies that it is indeed possible to skip infinitely many digits in the decimal expansion of a positive irrational number and still recover the original number ( A ).

By making each bus carry 32 students instead, and considering 3 empty seats in total: [ 32x - 3 ] represents all occupied seats subtracted by the 3 empty seats. 3. **Formulate the Equation:** Equate the two expressions because both represent the total number of students: [ 28x + 13 = 32x - 3 ] 4. **Solve for ( x ):** Isolate ( x ) by first eliminating constants from both sides: [ 28x + 13 - 13= 32x - 3 - 13 ] Simplifying, [ 28x = 32x - 16 ] Subtract ( 28x ) from both sides: [ 0 = 4x - 16 ] or, [ 4x = 16 ] Then solve for ( x ): [ x = frac{16}{4} = 4 ] Therefore, the number of buses rented is: [ x = 4 ] 5. **Find Total Number of Students:** Substitute ( x = 4 ) back to find the total number of students: [ 28x + 13 = 28 times 4 + 13 = 112 + 13 = 125 ] # Conclusion: The school has a total of 125 students in the third grade and rented 4 buses.

The two concrete crossroads divide the park into three equal parts along the length. Since the roads are running in the middle of the park, they divide the length into three equal parts, with each part being L/3 meters long. The width of each road is 3 meters, so the total width of the two roads is 2 * 3 = 6 meters. The area of the park is the sum of the area of the lawn and the area of the roads. The area of the lawn is given as 2109 sq. m. The area of the roads can be calculated as the sum of the areas of the two roads. Each road has an area of (L/3) * 3 = L meters (since the width of each road is 3 meters). So the total area of the two roads is 2 * L = 2L sq. m. Now, we can write the total area of the park (A) as the sum of the area of the lawn and the area of the roads: A = Area of the lawn + Area of the roads A = 2109 + 2L The total area of the park can also be calculated by multiplying the length by the width: A = L * 40 Now we have two expressions for the total area of the park, so we can set them equal to each other: L * 40 = 2109 + 2L To find the length of the park, we need to solve for L. Let's move the terms involving L to one side: 40L - 2L = 2109 Combine like terms: 38L = 2109 Now, divide both sides by 38 to solve for L: L = 2109 / 38 L = 55.5 meters So, the length of the park is boxed{55.5} meters."},{"prompt":"Let mathbf{R} be the matrix for reflecting over the vector begin{pmatrix} 4 2 end{pmatrix}.

The sum of the areas of all such squares is: [ sum_{i=1}^{infty} frac{1}{i} ] This series diverges (harmonic series). 5. **Implication of divergence:** Since the sum of the areas of the squares diverges, it implies that the centers of these squares cannot all be contained within a bounded region.

One approach is to partition the number 8 into three parts according to the given constraints and count each valid partition as a separate distribution scheme. The possible distributions of 8, where every part is at least 1 and one part is at least 2 (for School A), are as follows: 1. (6, 1, 1) – School A can be any of the three positions in this distribution, so there is 1 times {3 choose 1} = 3 ways. 2. (5, 2, 1) – There are {3 choose 1} ways to choose which school gets 5 positions. Without loss of generality, let's assign the 5 positions to School A; then there are 1 times 2 (since the remaining two schools can be arranged in 2 different ways) ways to arrange the rest. 3. (4, 3, 1) – Again, there are {3 choose 1} ways to choose which school gets 4 positions (we assign this to School A), and for the other 2 schools, we simply arrange them in the remaining two slots. This gives us 1 times 2 ways. 4. (4, 2, 2) – If School A receives 4 positions, no matter how the other two schools receive the remaining positions, it doesn't change the count since 2 and 2 are interchangeable. So there is only 1 way. 5. (3, 3, 2) – School A can be either of the schools receiving 3 positions. There are {3 choose 1} - 1 ways for this since we subtract the scenario where School A is the one with 2 positions that we don't want. Since the remaining two numbers are the same, the assignments are the same, so there's just 1 way to assign the remaining positions. According to the principle of combinatorial counting, we sum up the ways for each of these distributions, and we get a total number of ways as follows: 3 + (1 times 2) + (1 times 2) + 1 + (2 times 1) = 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 10 So, there are boxed{10} different ways to allocate the 8 teaching positions to the three schools according to the given requirements."},{"prompt":"Let A=left{{x∈N|y=frac{{12}}{{x+3}}∈N}right}.

Let's break this down step by step. # Step 1: Identify the Elements of Set A The condition for an element x to belong to set A is that y=frac{12}{x+3} must be a natural number. This means that x+3 has to be a divisor of 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. However, since we are adding 3 to x to get these divisors, we subtract 3 from each to find the corresponding x values, which gives us: - For 1, x = 1 - 3 = -2 (not a natural number, so it's excluded) - For 2, x = 2 - 3 = -1 (not a natural number, so it's excluded) - For 3, x = 3 - 3 = 0 - For 4, x = 4 - 3 = 1 - For 6, x = 6 - 3 = 3 - For 12, x = 12 - 3 = 9 Thus, the elements of set A that satisfy the given condition are {0, 1, 3, 9}. # Step 2: Calculate the Number of Subsets The number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^{n}.

D: Given that A and B are two events in a random experiment, and Pleft(Aright) gt 0, Pleft(Bright) gt 0, if A and B are not independent, then Pleft(Acup Bright)neq Pleft(Aright)+Pleft(Bright).","completion":"For option A: The probability of event A occurring in a single experiment is 0.9. In 10 repeated experiments, the probability of event A not occurring in a single trial is 1 - 0.9 = 0.1. Thus, the probability of event A not occurring at all in 10 experiments is (0.1)^{10}. This value is greater than 0, which means it is possible for event A not to occur at all in 10 repeated experiments. Therefore, option A is correct. For option B: We define the events as follows: - A: getting an even number, which means the outcomes could be 2, 4, or 6. - B: getting 1 or 2. The probability of event A occurring is P(A) = frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2}, since there are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes in a dice roll. The probability of event B occurring is P(B) = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3}, since 1 or 2 are 2 out of the 6 possible outcomes. The probability of both A and B occurring, which is getting a 2, is P(AB) = frac{1}{6}. Since P(AB) = P(A) cdot P(B)= frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6}, we conclude that events A and B are independent. Thus, option B is correct. For option C: The probability that Xiao Ming encounters a red light for the first time at the 3rd intersection can be found by considering that he must not encounter a red light at the first and second intersections and then encounter one at the third intersection. The probability of not encountering a red light at an intersection is 1 - frac{2}{3} = frac{1}{3}. Therefore, the probability of encountering a red light for the first time at the 3rd intersection is left(frac{1}{3}right)^2 times frac{2}{3} = frac{1}{9} times frac{2}{3} = frac{2}{27}.

If A and B are not independent, this does not imply that P(A cup B) neq P(A) + P(B) by default.

We proceed in the following steps: 1. **Definition and Vertex Integrity:** - Consider a convex n-gon with vertices labeled A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n. - Drawing all diagonals means connecting every pair of vertices that are not adjacent. 2. **Maximum Edge Connections:** - Each vertex can connect to every other vertex except itself and the two adjacent vertices. - Therefore, each vertex can be the endpoint of (n-3) diagonals. 3. **Propagating Lines through Vertices:** - Any direct line segment (side or diagonal) of any polygon formed by these segments must pass through exactly two vertices of the original n-gon. - This means no internal point arising from the intersections of diagonals of our original n-gon can be a vertex in the resultant smaller polygons unless it coincides with a vertex A_i of the original n-gon. 4. **Side Count Enforcement:** - Each side of the smaller polygon must be either an edge of the original n-gon or a diagonal connecting two of its vertices. - Given no additional vertices beyond A_1, ldots, A_n are introduced, the total number of vertices involved in any side of the resulting smaller polygons cannot exceed n. 5. **Summarization and Conclusion:** - Thus, since every side of any smaller polygon is defined by the vertices of the original n-gon and noting that every single segment (side or diagonal) can belong to at most two such smaller polygons, it is clear that each resultant polygon cannot have more than n sides.

To do this, we prove a stronger statement by induction: **Suppose that ( m ) distinct three-element subsets ( A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{m} ) of an ( n )-element set are given, no two having a one-element intersection. Then ( m ) cannot exceed ( n ), and ( m ) can only equal ( n ) if ( 4 mid n ).** **Base cases**: 1. If ( n = 0 ), there are no elements and no subsets. This trivially satisfies the conditions. 2.

That leaves us with ( n-3 ) elements and ( m-1 ) sets. By the induction hypothesis, ( m-1 ) must not exceed ( n-3 ), but this would contradict the existence of ( m ) since ( m leq n ). **Case 2:** Some other set intersects ( {1, 2, 3} ). Without loss of generality, let ( A_2 = {1, 2, 4} ). - Any set ( A_i ) intersecting ( A_1 ) in two elements must intersect ( A_2), which implies (left|A_i cap A_2right| = 2).

Prove that it is still possible to place at least one more 3 times 3 small board on the large chessboard without overlapping any of the 99 already placed small boards.","completion":"1. **Introduction**: Consider a large 48 times 48 chessboard containing small 3 times 3 chessboards. Each 3 times 3 chessboard covers 9 small squares. We need to show that it is always possible to place one more 3 times 3 chessboard on the 48 times 48 chessboard such that it does not overlap with any of the previously placed 99 3 times 3 chessboards. 2. **Expansion of Small Chessboards**: To simplify the problem, expand each 3 times 3 chessboard by adding a frame around it, making it a 5 times 5 chessboard. This increases each chessboard to cover an area of 5 times 5 = 25 small squares. This padding ensures that if two 3 times 3 chessboards overlap in a 5 times 5 area, they actually overlap in the 3 times 3 area. 3. **Reduction of the Large Chessboard**: Consider the large 48 times 48 chessboard, but remove a layer of squares along the boundary. This results in a reduced 46 times 46 chessboard. This modified chessboard will help us in our coverage argument. 4. **Identify Target Squares**: Now observe only certain squares in the reduced 46 times 46 chessboard. Specifically, look at squares located at rows and columns numbered 2, 7, 12, ldots, 47. These rows and columns are spaced by 5, ensuring that each 5 times 5 expanded chessboard can only cover one of these key squares. There are [ frac{47 - 2}{5} + 1 = 10 ] such indices in both rows and columns. Hence, the total number of squares observed is: [ 10 times 10 = 100 ] 5. **Account for Placement**: Each expanded 5 times 5 chessboard can cover at most one of these 100 key squares. Given that we have 99 such expanded chessboards placed on the 46 times 46 board, they can cover at most 99 of these 100 squares. 6. **Final Placement**: Since the 99 expanded chessboards cover at most 99 of the 100 key squares, at least one key square will remain uncovered. This uncovered square (denote it as the 'critical square') implies that there is space for an additional 3 times 3 chessboard. By placing the new 3 times 3 chessboard centered at this \\"critical square,\\" it ensures no overlap with any of the previously placed 99 3 times 3 chessboards, as the critical square guarantees space surrounded by free squares to frame the new board within a 5 times 5 space, untouched by others. # Conclusion: Therefore, there is always enough space to place one more 3 times 3 chessboard on the 48 times 48 chessboard without any overlap with the 99 previously placed 3 times 3 chessboards. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"The circumference of sector AOB is 6cm, and the central angle of the sector is 1 radian.

To ensure the calculations stay consistent with the given ratios: - Since (AB: BC = 2:1), (BC) will be one-third of (AC), and (AB) will be two-thirds of (AC). - This translates (AB) to 10 parts and (BC) to 5 parts, as (10 + 5 = 15). 3.

How many rabbits does each fox catch per week on average?","completion":"Let's start by calculating the total number of weasels and rabbits caught by the foxes over the 3 weeks. Initially, there are 100 weasels and 50 rabbits, making a total of 150 animals. After 3 weeks, there are 96 animals left (both weasels and rabbits combined). This means that the foxes have caught a total of 150 - 96 = 54 animals over the 3 weeks. Now, let's calculate the number of weasels caught by the foxes over the 3 weeks. Each fox catches an average of 4 weasels per week. With 3 foxes, they catch a total of 4 weasels/fox/week * 3 foxes = 12 weasels per week. Over 3 weeks, the foxes catch 12 weasels/week * 3 weeks = 36 weasels. Now we can find out how many rabbits were caught over the 3 weeks. Since the foxes caught a total of 54 animals and we know that 36 of them were weasels, the remaining number must be rabbits. 54 total caught - 36 weasels caught = 18 rabbits caught over 3 weeks. To find the average number of rabbits caught per week by each fox, we divide the total number of rabbits caught by the number of weeks and then by the number of foxes: 18 rabbits / 3 weeks = 6 rabbits per week (for all foxes together). To find the average per fox, we divide by the number of foxes: 6 rabbits per week / 3 foxes = 2 rabbits per fox per week.

The lengths of the four known roads are 10 km, 5 km, 8 km, and 21 km. In this problem, we can use the Triangle Inequality Theorem. The Triangle Inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. 1. **Step 1**: - Consider the triangle formed by the roads with lengths x, 10 km, and 8 km. Applying the Triangle Inequality theorem: [ x + 10 > 8 ] [ x + 8 > 10 ] [ 10 + 8 > x ] - Simplify these inequalities: [ x + 10 > 8 implies x > -2 ] [ x + 8 > 10 implies x > 2 ] [ 10 + 8 > x implies x < 18 ] 2. **Step 2**: - Consider the triangle formed by the roads with lengths x, 5 km, and 21 km.

John paid 1000 upfront and then 100 per hour for 50 hours of court time. So the cost for the court time is: 50 hours * 100/hour = 5000 Adding the upfront fee: 5000 + 1000 = 6000 Now, we know that John's total payment was 8000, which means the prep time cost an additional: 8000 - 6000 = 2000 Since the hourly rate is 100, we can find out how many hours of prep time this accounts for: 2000 / 100/hour = 20 hours Now, we have 50 hours of court time and 20 hours of prep time. The ratio of prep time to court time is: 20 hours prep time / 50 hours court time = 2/5 or 0.4 Finally, we need to determine how much John paid.

It is known that 2023 red chameleons can agree on a sequence of bites such that they all become blue. What is the smallest mathrm{k} that guarantees that mathrm{k} red chameleons can agree on a sequence of bites to become blue? For example, the rules could be: if a red chameleon bites a green one, the bitten changes color to blue; if a green bites a red, the bitten remains red; if a red chameleon bites a red one, the bitten changes to yellow, and so on. (The specific color change rules may vary.)","completion":"1. **Introduction of Example Rules**: Let's consider some example rules to determine the minimum number of red chameleons needed for all to become blue. - **Situation Setup**: Suppose there are five colors of chameleons on the island, where red is the first color and blue is the last. - **Rule Construction**: We might have rules such that if a chameleon of color ( k ) (where ( k < 5 )) bites another chameleon of color ( k ), the bitten chameleon changes to color ( k+1 ). Furthermore, any chameleon bitten by a blue chameleon also becomes blue. Other interactions do not result in a color change. 2. **Minimum Number Analysis**: - **Initial Consideration**: If initially there are only four red chameleons, they cannot all become blue regardless of the sequence of bites. - **Reason**: Because a new emerging color cannot disappear before blue appears, and no further colors can appear without having all preceding colors. Hence, at least five red chameleons are required to ensure the presence of each color up to blue. 3. **Proof of Sufficiency with Five Red Chameleons**: - **Two-stage Recoloring Process**: The process can be broken down into two stages: **Stage 1**: - As the (2023) initially red chameleons undergo color changes to blue, the five selected red chameleons must change colors similarly. - Maintain two conditions: 1. No more than one chameleon of each other color in the group, with the rest remaining red. 2. The color palette of our five chameleons should evolve to always include colors among the initial 2023 chameleons. - **Execution**: - Wait until a new color appears among the (2023) chameleons. - Follow the same biting sequence that transforms one red chameleon ( X ) to the new color and replicate this sequence with one red chameleon from the selected group. **Stage 2**: - Once all possible colors have appeared, all chameleons of every new color need to become blue. - **Order structure**: - Identify the final appearances of each color and order the colors in reverse order. - Sequentially using the biting rule, each colored chameleon can become blue. 4. **Conclusion**: The solution requires a detailed breakdown to verify the minimum number ( k ) for the chameleons to successfully change to blue under the given sequence of color-changing rules. With the assumptions and implementation of the rules as described, it is noted that: **Answer**: The minimum number ( k ) of red chameleons needed is ( boxed{5} )."},{"prompt":"Compute 10^{1}pmod{1729}.

For each ( n times n times 1 ) rectangular prism (in any of the three possible directions), considering the set of colors that appear in that prism (each color appears only once), we obtain ( 3n ) sets of colors, which are divided into three groups according to the direction. For each color set in any one group, it appears in every group of the other two directions. Find the maximum number of colors (expressed as a function of ( n )). 1. Introduce a distance measure ( d(X, Y) ) between two color sequences ( X ) and ( Y ), defined as the minimum number of operations required to change ( X ) into ( Y ). 2. For any three color sequences ( X, Y, Z ), the triangle inequality for distances holds: [ d(X, Y) + d(Y, Z) geq d(X, Z). ] 3. Consider two specific color sequences ( P ) and ( Q ): [ begin{array}{l} P = underbrace{a cdots a}_{n uparrow} underbrace{b cdots b}_{n uparrow} underbrace{c cdots c}_{n uparrow}, Q = underbrace{d cdots d}_{n uparrow} underbrace{e cdots e}_{n uparrow} underbrace{f cdots f}_{n uparrow}. end{array} ] 4. Show that ( d(P, Q) geq 3n^2 ). **Proof:** - Define the function ( f_{u, v}(X) ) counting the occurrences where letter ( u ) is on the left and letter ( v ) is on the right in sequence ( X ). - Define the function ( f(X) = f_{a, b}(X) + f_{a, c}(X) + f_{b, c}(X) ). - Note that: [ f_{a, b}(P) = f_{a, c}(P) = f_{b, c}(P) = n^2 ] Hence, ( f(P) = 3n^2 ). - For ( Q ), each pair combination does not appear: [ f_{a, b}(Q) = f_{a, c}(Q) = f_{b, c}(Q) = 0 ] Hence, ( f(Q) = 0 ). 5. Consider an operation changing ( X ) to ( X' ) where letters ( a ) and ( b ) switch places. Then: [ |f_{a, b}(X) - f_{a, b}(X')| = 1 ] Other pair counts remain unchanged: [ f_{a, c}(X) = f_{a, c}(X'), quad f_{b, c}(X) = f_{b, c}(X') ] Therefore: [ |f(X) - f(X')| = 1 ] 6. For any two color sequences ( X ) and ( Y ), it must hold that: [ d(X, Y) geq |f(X) - f(Y)| ] 7. Specifically for ( P ) and ( Q ): [ d(P, Q) geq |f(P) - f(Q)| = 3n^2 ] This proves the lemma. 8. For any color sequence ( X ): [ d(X, P) + d(X, Q) geq d(P, Q) geq 3n^2 ] 9. Therefore: [ max { d(X, P), d(X, Q) } geq frac{3n^2}{2} ] This indicates that the max number of operations required (i.e., the max number of different colors) is dependent on ( n ).

Since these numbers are permutations of the set ({1, 2, 3, 4}), the total number of permutations is: [ 4! = 24 ] 2. **Sum of Digits at Each Position:** Since each position (units, tens, hundreds, and thousands) in the 24 numbers is equally likely to contain any of the digits (1, 2, 3,) and (4), we compute the sum of digits appearing at each position. Each digit (1, 2, 3, 4) appears exactly (6) times in each position. (This is because there are (24) numbers and each digit must appear exactly ( frac{24}{4} = 6 ) times at each position). Thus, the sum of the digits at each position is: [ 6 times (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 6 times 10 = 60 ] 3. **Computing Total Sum of All Numbers:** The total sum of all the four-digit numbers is calculated by considering the positional values. Using the fact that each digit sum is multiplied by its positional place value (units, tens, hundreds, thousands): [ 60 times (1 + 10 + 100 + 1000) = 60 times 1111 = 66660 ] 4. **Finding the Missing Sum:** Given that Pat initially computed the sum as (58126), we find out the sum of the two numbers he missed by computing the difference between the actual total sum and the sum he calculated: [ 66660 - 58126 = 8534 ] 5. **Decomposing the Missing Sum into Two Numbers:** Since the sum (8534) should be the sum of two four-digit numbers containing the digits (1, 2, 3, 4), we will break down the sum into plausible digit pairs: - (8) can be expressed as (4 + 4) - (5) can be expressed as (2 + 3) (excluding (1 + 4) because that would result in a number doubling a digit) - (3) can be expressed as (1 + 2) - (4) can be expressed as (1 + 3) (excluding (2 + 2) for the same reason) Combining these, the numbers that add up to (8534) are (4213) and (4321). 6. **Conclusion:** The two numbers Pat originally forgot to include in his sum are: [ boxed{4213 text{ and } 4321} ]"},{"prompt":"From a group of nine students, how many different fivestudent committees can be formed if two specific students refuse to be on the committee together?","completion":"1.

(frac{1956}{3} = 652) signaling each complete replication. 7. **Final Calculation**: - For final configuration, each arc segment (D, C, A, B, E, ldots ) to cover all circle points means, taking into account 2 corresponding like-configurations per arc segment along the entire circle [ 2 times 652 = 1304. ] # Conclusion: The minimum number of points required is therefore: [ boxed{1304} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=x|x|, if f(x_0)=4, then the value of x_0 is ( ) A: 2 B: 2 C: 2 or 2 D: sqrt{2}","completion":"To find the value of x_0 for which f(x_0)=4, we substitute f(x_0) with 4 in the given function: f(x_0) = x_0|x_0| = 4 This equation holds true for x_0 = 2 because 2|2| = 4.

Therefore, the statement holds for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for some positive integer ( n = k ), there exists a ( k )-digit number ( M ) that is divisible by ( 5^k ) and all of whose digits are odd. 3. **Inductive Step:** We need to show that there exists a ( (k+1) )-digit number that is divisible by ( 5^{k+1} ) and all of whose digits are odd, based on the assumption for ( n = k ).

This is because ( i ) is odd and varies from 1 to 9 ensuring distinctiveness. 4. **Divisibility by ( 5^{k+1} ):** Since there are 5 distinct values ( N_i ) modulo ( 5 ), by the pigeonhole principle, among the 5 numbers, one of them must be divisible by 5. Therefore, at least one ( N_i ) among ( N_1, N_3, N_5, N_7, ) and ( N_9 ) must be divisible by ( 5^{k+1} ). Since ( i in {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} ) ensures that all digits remain odd, we have successfully constructed a ( (k+1) )-digit number ( N ) that meets the criteria. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that for every positive integer ( n ), there exists an ( n )-digit number divisible by ( 5^n ) and all of whose digits are odd.

One day, our business rents out 4 canoes for every 3 kayaks and receives a total of 460 in revenue. There were 5 more canoes than kayaks rented out. What is the cost of a canoe rental per day?","completion":"Let's denote the cost of renting a canoe per day as ( C ) dollars. According to the information given, there are 5 more canoes than kayaks rented out. If we let the number of kayaks rented out be ( K ), then the number of canoes rented out would be ( K + 5 ). However, we also know that for every 4 canoes rented, there are 3 kayaks rented. This means that the ratio of canoes to kayaks is 4:3. So we can express the number of canoes rented out as ( frac{4}{3}K ). Since both expressions represent the number of canoes rented out, we can set them equal to each other: [ K + 5 = frac{4}{3}K ] Now, let's solve for ( K ): [ K + 5 = frac{4}{3}K ] [ 3(K + 5) = 4K ] [ 3K + 15 = 4K ] [ 15 = 4K - 3K ] [ 15 = K ] So, 15 kayaks were rented out. This means that the number of canoes rented out is ( K + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20 ) canoes. Now, let's calculate the total revenue using the cost of kayak rentals and the unknown cost of canoe rentals: [ text{Total Revenue} = (text{Number of Canoes} times text{Cost of Canoe Rental}) + (text{Number of Kayaks} times text{Cost of Kayak Rental}) ] [ 460 = (20 times C) + (15 times 16) ] [ 460 = 20C + 240 ] [ 460 - 240 = 20C ] [ 220 = 20C ] [ C = frac{220}{20} ] [ C = 11 ] Therefore, the cost of a canoe rental per day is boxed{11} ."},{"prompt":"Each day a man meets his wife at the train station after work, and then she drives him home.

We begin by considering a quadratic irrationality alpha of the form: alpha = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = frac{P pm sqrt{D}}{Q}, where a, b, c are integers, Q = 2a, and P = -b. 2. We assume alpha has a continued fraction representation: alpha = [a_0; a_1, a_2, ldots]. 3. We examine the kth partial quotient: alpha_k = [a_k; a_{k+1}, a_{k+2}, ldots], with alpha expressed as: alpha = [a_0; a_1, ldots, a_{k-1}, alpha_k]. 4. By analyzing the continued fraction, we observe that the partial quotients alpha_k take only a finite number of distinct values. Due to the equality alpha = frac{P + sqrt{D}}{Q}, we also have alpha' = frac{P - sqrt{D}}{Q}. 5. Let's calculate: frac{2sqrt{D}}{Q} = alpha - alpha' > alpha > 0 and frac{2P}{Q} = alpha + alpha' > 0, so Q > 0 and P > 0. Given alpha' < 0 and alpha > 1, it follows that P < sqrt{D} and Q < P + sqrt{D} < 2sqrt{D}. Therefore, for a fixed D, there are only finitely many alpha_k of the form frac{P+sqrt{D}}{Q}. 6. We then demonstrate that alpha_1 is a quadratic irrational of the form frac{P_1 + sqrt{D}}{Q_1}. Using the relation: alpha = [a_0; alpha_1^{-1}] = a_0 + frac{1}{alpha_1}, yields: -frac{1}{alpha_1} = a_0 - alpha, so -frac{1}{alpha_1'} = a_0 - alpha' > 1. Further, frac{1}{alpha_1} = alpha - a_0 = frac{P + sqrt{D}}{Q} - a_0 = frac{-P_1 + sqrt{D}}{Q}, with P_1 = a_0 Q - P. Since P=-b, Q=2a, and D=b^2 - 4ac, the term P_1^2 - D is divisible by Q: alpha_1 = frac{Q}{-P_1 + sqrt{D}} = -frac{Q(P_1 + sqrt{D})}{P_1^2 - D} = frac{P_1 + sqrt{D}}{Q_1}. 7. By induction, every alpha_k is a quadratic irrational of the form frac{P_k + sqrt{D}}{Q_k} with integer P_k, Q_k, since alpha_k = a_k + frac{1}{alpha_{k+1}}. As previously shown, there is only a finite number of these alpha values. 8. Finally, we validate the periodicity by noting if alpha_k = alpha_l for k, l geq 1, then alpha_{k-1} = alpha_{l-1} by induction. The relationship alpha = a_0 + frac{1}{alpha_1} shows that knowing alpha_1 determines alpha, as a_0=left[-frac{1}{alpha_1'}right]. Conclusively, any quadratic irrationality alpha has a continued fraction that is purely periodic, and its form is: alpha = [a_0; a_1, ldots, a_k, a_0, a_1, ldots, a_k, ldots]. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let ( A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots ) be an arbitrary sequence of events.

Given 0 < B < pi, the angle B that satisfies cos B = frac{1}{2} is B = frac{pi}{3}, which implies A + C = frac{2pi}{3}, and thus C = frac{2pi}{3} - A. From part (1), we have f(x) = sqrt{2}cosleft(frac{1}{2}xright). Applying this to A and C, we get: f^{2}(A) + f^{2}(C) = 2cos^{2}left(frac{1}{2}Aright) + 2cos^{2}left(frac{1}{2}Cright) = cos A + cos C + 2. Substituting C = frac{2pi}{3} - A: = cos A + cosleft(frac{2pi}{3} - Aright) + 2 = cos A - frac{1}{2}cos A + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin A + 2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}sin A + frac{1}{2}cos A + 2 = sinleft(A + frac{pi}{6}right) + 2. Given 0 < A < frac{2pi}{3}, we find that frac{pi}{6} < A + frac{pi}{6} < frac{5pi}{6}, which implies sin(A + frac{pi}{6})in (frac{1}{2}, 1]. Thus, the range of f^{2}(A) + f^{2}(C) is boxed{(frac{5}{2}, 3]}."},{"prompt":"One angle of a parallelogram is 150 degrees, and two consecutive sides have lengths of 10 inches and 20 inches.

We can drop a perpendicular from point D to line AB at point X. Triangle ADX will then be a 30-60-90 triangle, where AD is the hypotenuse because angle AXD is 90 degrees and angle ADX is 30 degrees. We know the side ratios in a 30-60-90 triangle are 1:sqrt{3}:2.

We need to prove that the number of sides of this polygon is divisible by 4. 2. **Represent the polygon using vectors:** Let the polygon be represented by vectors. Since the polygon is closed, the sum of all vectors must be zero. Suppose the polygon consists of ( k ) horizontal vectors and ( k ) vertical vectors. This is because each horizontal movement must be balanced by an equal and opposite horizontal movement, and similarly for vertical movements. 3. **Properties of the vectors:** Let the horizontal vectors be (overrightarrow{x_{1}}, overrightarrow{x_{2}}, dots, overrightarrow{x_{k}}) and the vertical vectors be (overrightarrow{y_{1}}, overrightarrow{y_{2}}, dots, overrightarrow{y_{k}}). Each vector has an odd length, meaning the magnitude of each vector is an odd number. 4. **Sum of vectors:** Since the polygon is closed, the sum of all horizontal vectors must be zero, and the sum of all vertical vectors must be zero: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} overrightarrow{x_{i}} = overrightarrow{0} quad text{and} quad sum_{i=1}^{k} overrightarrow{y_{i}} = overrightarrow{0} ] 5. **Implication of odd lengths:** Each (|overrightarrow{x_{i}}|) and (|overrightarrow{y_{i}}|) is odd.

For an ellipse centered at the origin, the directrices are given by the equations x = pm dfrac{a^2}{c} for horizontal major axis and y = pm dfrac{a^2}{c} for vertical major axis. In our case, we have an ellipse with the equation dfrac{x^2}{8} + dfrac{y^2}{9} = 1. From this, we can deduce that a^2 = 9 and b^2 = 8. To find c, we use the relationship c^2 = a^2 - b^2, which leads to c^2 = 9 - 8 = 1 and thus c = 1.

Substituting a^2 = 9 and c = 1, we get the equations of the directrices as y = pm 9. The distance between the two directrices is simply the difference of the y values, which is 9 - (-9) = 18.

Since Barbie and Bruno make 12 trips together, and Barbie can carry 4 coconuts at a time, the total number of coconuts Barbie carries over the 12 trips is 12 trips * 4 coconuts/trip = 48 coconuts. The total number of coconuts carried by both Barbie and Bruno together in 12 trips is 144 coconuts (the entire pile). If we subtract the number of coconuts Barbie carries from the total, we get the number of coconuts Bruno carries: 144 coconuts (total) - 48 coconuts (carried by Barbie) = 96 coconuts (carried by Bruno). Now, we know that Bruno carries these 96 coconuts in 12 trips, so we can find out how many coconuts he carries per trip by dividing the total number of coconuts he carries by the number of trips: 96 coconuts / 12 trips = 8 coconuts/trip.

Point E is defined as the midpoint of AB. The line CD is perpendicular to AB at E, making triangle CDE a right triangle with DE = EC. 2. **Analyze the Triangle CDE**: Since CD is perpendicular to AB at E, and AB is a chord, the right angle at E and isosceles right triangles properties imply CE = DE. 3. **Properties of Bisector of angle OCD**: - The bisector of angle OCD passes through O due to symmetry. As C moves along arc AB, angle OCD varies, but the bisector still passes through O and the circle's center remains invariant. 4. **Behavior of Point P**: - The bisector, passing through O, intersects the circle at two points along its length. Since CD perp AB and E is the midpoint of AB, the bisector will always pass through E and O. - The bisector will thus bisect angle EOD, meaning P does not necessarily match D but will always be on the perpendicular bisector of CD. 5. **Conclusion**: - As C moves over the arc AB, the bisector of angle OCD will vary its intersecting point on the circumference, but will always be on the perpendicular bisector of CD. textbf{(E) text{lie along the perpendicular bisector of }CD} The final answer is boxed{textbf{(E)} text{lies along the perpendicular bisector of }CD}"},{"prompt":"Solve the inequality (frac{|x+3| + |1x|}{x+2016} < 1).","completion":"We are given the inequality: frac{|x+3| + |1-x|}{x + 2016} < 1 Now we need to solve this inequality by considering different cases based on x and its effect on the absolute values.

Notice that, when x=1, all terms with an x will vanish from the right side of the equation, so we actually don't need to work with x=1 in this case. Instead, we can choose a different value of x that will give us information about the sum involving a_1, a_2, ldots, a_9. A good choice is x=2, since this will align with the sum we need to evaluate. Set x=2, we get: a_0 + a_1 cdot 2 + a_2 cdot 2^2 + ldots + a_9 cdot 2^9 = (1 + 2)(1 - 2 cdot 2)^8 = 3 cdot (-1)^8 = 3^1.

This is still not the sum we seek, and thus, setting x=2 does not directly work out due to a mistake in the process.

Expanding this and looking at the coefficients of x where they are multiplied by a power of 2, we can get the sum of interest. To solve this problem correctly, we need to calculate each term involving a power of x matched with a power of 2. However, since we're looking at the sum of terms where each a_i is multiplied by 2^i, this is equivalent to setting x=2 and subtracting a_0, which we've already established as 1: Set x=2 to get: (1 + 2)(1 - 2 cdot 2)^8 = 3(1 - 4)^8 = 3(-3)^8 = 3^9.

Since 10 males chose Paper Cutting, the number of females choosing Paper Cutting is 30 - 10 = 20. - The total number of students is 100. Since there are 50 males, the number of females is also 100 - 50 = 50. - Given that 20 females chose Paper Cutting and the total number of females is 50, the number of females choosing Calligraphy is 50 - 20 = 30. - The total number of students choosing Calligraphy is 40 (males) + 30 (females) = 70. - The total number of students is confirmed to be 100.

A bunny will start drumming if both their drum and sticks are larger than those of another bunny. Given these conditions: 1. **Initial Observation** - It's clear that not all bunnies can start drumming because for each bunny, there must be another bunny whose drum and sticks are smaller for them to start drumming. 2. **Strategy to Maximize Drumming Bunnies** - Let's consider the bunny that receives the smallest drum. This bunny will never drum because there’s no smaller drum for comparison (this smallest drum cannot prevail over any other drum in either size or length). - Now, if this same bunny also receives the smallest pair of sticks, then this bunny is completely out of the competition. - This leaves 6 bunnies each with a larger-sized drum and longer sticks compared to the smallest drum and shortest sticks. 3. **Verification** - For the remaining 6 bunnies, each has a drum and sticks that are larger than the smallest, so they will always be able to find another bunny (the one with the smallest drum and sticks) whose drum and sticks are smaller than theirs.

Consequently, (EN = h - y). 2. **Area Conditions**: - The area of trapezoid (ABCD) is given by: [ S_{ABCD} = frac{1}{2} (AD + BC) cdot KN = frac{1}{2} (a + b) cdot h. ] - Given that (AM) cuts off (frac{1}{4}) of the area of (ABCD), we have: [ S_{triangle AED} = frac{1}{4}S_{ABCD}. ] 3. **Calculating (y)**: - The area of (triangle AED) is: [ S_{triangle AED} = frac{1}{2} AD cdot EN = frac{1}{2} a cdot (h - y). ] - Setting the area (S_{triangle AED}) equal to (frac{1}{4}S_{ABCD}), we get: [ frac{1}{2} a (h - y) = frac{1}{4} cdot frac{1}{2} (a + b) cdot h. ] Simplifying, [ a (h - y) = frac{1}{2} (a + b) h. ] Further, [ 2a h - 2a y = a h + b h, ] [ 2a h - a h = b h + 2a y, ] [ a h = b h + 2a y, ] [ 4 a y = 3 a h - b h, ] [ y = frac{h(3 a-b)}{4 a}. ] 4. **Considering the Second Configuration**: - In the second possibility where ( triangle AED ) contributes (frac{3}{4} ) of the area of (ABCD): [ S_{triangle AED} = frac{3}{4} S_{ABCD}, ] [ a (h - y) = frac{3}{4} (a + b) h, ] Simplifying, [ 4 a h - 4 a y = 3 a h + 3 b h, ] [ 4 a y = a h - 3 b h, ] [ y = frac{h(a-3 b)}{4 a}. ] 5. **Finding (x = CM)**: - Using the similarity of (triangle AED) and (triangle MEC), which gives: [ frac{MC}{AD} = frac{KE}{EN}, ] [ frac{x}{a} = frac{y}{h-y}. ] - For ( y = frac{h(3a-b)}{4a} ): [ x = frac{a cdot frac{h(3a-b)}{4a}}{h - frac{h(3a - b)}{4a}} = frac{(3a-b)}{4 left(1 - frac{(3a-b)}{4a}right)} = frac{a(3a-b)}{a+b}. ] - For ( y = frac{h(a-3b)}{4a} ): [ x = frac{a cdot frac{h(a-3b)}{4a}}{h - frac{h(a - 3b)}{4a}} = frac{(a-3b)}{4 left(1 - frac{(a - 3b)}{4a}right)} = frac{a(a-3b)}{3(a+b)}. ] **Conclusion**: The possible lengths of (CM) are: [ boxed{frac{a(3a - b)}{a + b} text{ or } frac{a(a - 3b)}{3(a + b)}.} ]"},{"prompt":"Let mathbb{Z}^+ denote the set of all positive integers.

Both ( binom{f(a,b)}{a} ) and ( binom{f(a,b)}{b} ) are odd numbers. 2. **Analyzing the binomial coefficient condition:** - According to Lucas's Theorem, a binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{k} ) is odd if and only if every bit in the binary representation of ( k ) is less than or equal to the corresponding bit in the binary representation of ( n ). - Therefore, for ( binom{f(a,b)}{a} ) and ( binom{f(a,b)}{b} ) to be odd, ( f(a,b) ) must have all bits set in ( a ) and ( b ) set in ( f(a,b) ).

Since one side (the length) is not fenced, the total fencing covers two widths and one length.

How many roots lie in each quadrant of the complex plane?","completion":"Let's solve the problem in a step-by-step format to determine how many roots lie in each quadrant of the complex plane for the polynomial ( p(z) ). 1. **Polynomial Analysis**: [ p(z) = z^6 + 6z + 10 ] We first note that there are no real roots. To see this, examine the polynomial for real values of ( z ). The term ( z^6 ) dominates for large positive and negative values of ( z ), making ( p(z) ) large and positive. To analyze the behavior on the real line, notice that the polynomial ( p(z) ) reaches its minimum for real ( z ) where its derivative equals 0. 2. **Derivative and Minimum for Real ( z )**: [ frac{d}{dz} p(z) = 6z^5 + 6 = 0 implies z^5 = -1 implies z = -1 ] At ( z = -1 ): [ p(-1) = (-1)^6 + 6(-1) + 10 = 1 - 6 + 10 = 5 ] Thus, the minimum value of ( p(z) ) for real ( z ) is 5, confirming there are no real roots. 3. **Imaginary Roots Analysis**: Consider purely imaginary roots ( z = iy ): [ p(iy) = (iy)^6 + 6(iy) + 10 = -y^6 + 6iy + 10 ] The imaginary part is ( 6iy ) and the real part is ( -y^6 + 10 ): To be a root, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero: - Real part: ( -y^6 + 10 = 0 implies y^6 = 10 implies y = pm sqrt[6]{10} ) - Imaginary part: ( 6iy = 0 implies y = 0 ) Consequently, there is no ( y ) satisfying both conditions, so there are no purely imaginary roots. 4. **Symmetry in Roots**: Since ( p(z) = z^6 + 6z + 10 ), based on the property that for a root ( a + ib ), ( a - ib ) is also a root because the polynomial has real coefficients. This symmetry indicates that the roots are distributed symmetrically about the real axis. 5. **Applying the Argument Principle**: According to the argument principle, the change in the argument of ( p(z) ) around a closed contour ( C ) that does not pass through any zeros and encloses ( k ) zeros is ( 2pi k ). - Consider the contour in the first quadrant: - Start from ( z = 0 ) to ( z = X ) along the real axis. - Move along the arc of radius ( X ) to ( z = iX ) in the first quadrant. - Finally, move back along the imaginary axis to ( z = 0 ). 6. **Change in Argument**: - Moving from ( 0 ) to ( X ) along the real axis, ( text{arg}(p(z)) ) remains unchanged as ( p(z) ) is real. - Moving along the arc from ( X ) to ( iX ): The change in argument approximates the change in ( text{arg}(z^6) ). For ( X ) large enough: [ Delta text{arg}(p(z)) approx Delta text{arg}(X^6 text{cis}(0) to X^6 text{cis}(frac{pi}{2})) = frac{3pi}{2} ] - On returning along the imaginary axis: For large ( X ): [ p(iX) approx -X^6 text{ and } p(0) = 10 ] Therefore, the change in argument from ( X ) to ( 0 ) along the imaginary axis ( -pi ). 7. **Total Change in Argument**: Combining all parts of the trip, the net change: [ Delta text{arg}(p(z)) = Delta text{arg}( text{real axis} ) + Delta text{arg}( text{arc} ) + Delta text{arg}( text{imaginary axis } ) = 0 + 3pi - pi = 2pi ] Hence, there is exactly one zero in the first quadrant. 8. **Distribution of Roots in the Quadrants**: Given the symmetry of ( a + ib ) and ( a - ib ) and one root in the first quadrant, same must hold for roots in other quadrants. # Conclusion: [ boxed{1 text{ root in each of the first and fourth quadrants, and 2 in each of the second and third quadrants.}} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

So, the total number of employees who attended the picnic is: 0.3E Let's denote the percentage of men who attended the picnic as P (where P is a fraction, so for example, if 50% of men attended, P would be 0.5). The number of men who attended the picnic is then: PM = P * 0.5E The total number of employees who attended the picnic is the sum of the number of men and the number of women who attended: 0.3E = PM + 0.2E 0.3E = P * 0.5E + 0.2E Now we can solve for P: 0.3E - 0.2E = P * 0.5E 0.1E = P * 0.5E Divide both sides by 0.5E: (0.1E) / (0.5E) = P 0.1 / 0.5 = P P = 0.2 So, the percentage of men who attended the picnic is boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"Given propositions p: x+2geq0 and x10leq0, proposition q: 1mleq xleq 1+m, m>0.

Therefore, we can assume: x = 14 (for the larger number) y = 13 (for the smaller number) Now we can find the two numbers: A = H.C.F * x A = 25 * 14 A = 350 B = H.C.F * y B = 25 * 13 B = 325 So, the larger of the two numbers is boxed{350} ."},{"prompt":"the math test, Jimin ranked 24th, and Seokjin ranked 19 ranks ahead of Jimin.

Therefore, we apply this property to the given function: fleft(xright)=1-frac{a•{3}^{x}}{{3}^{x}+1}, and for f(-x), we have: fleft(-xright)=1-frac{a•{3}^{-x}}{{3}^{-x}+1}. Setting f(-x)=-f(x) leads to: 1-frac{a•{3}^{-x}}{{3}^{-x}+1}=-left(1-frac{a•{3}^{x}}{{3}^{x}+1}right), which simplifies to: left(a-2right)left(3^{x}+1right)=0. From this equation, we conclude that a=2 for the equation to hold true for all x. Given that f(x) is defined in the interval (2b-6,b), and for the function to be odd, the interval must be symmetric about 0, leading to 2b-6+b=0. Solving this equation gives: 3b-6=0 implies b=2. Therefore, the values of a and b are a=2 and b=2. Thus, we have: boxed{a=2, b=2}. Part 2: Proving f(x) is a decreasing function From part 1, we know f(x)=1-frac{2•{3}^{x}}{{3}^{x}+1} for x in (-4,2). To prove f(x) is decreasing, consider two points x_1 and x_2 where x_1 < x_2. We evaluate the difference f(x_1) - f(x_2): f(x_{1})-f(x_{2})=frac{2({3}^{x_{2}}-{3}^{x_{1}})}{({3}^{x_{1}}+1)({3}^{x_{2}}+1)}. Since x_1 < x_2, it follows that {3}^{x_1} < {3}^{x_2}, and therefore, {3}^{x_2}-{3}^{x_1} > 0. Additionally, since both {3}^{x_1}+1 > 0 and {3}^{x_2}+1 > 0, the entire fraction is positive. This implies f(x_1) - f(x_2) > 0, or f(x_1) > f(x_2). Thus, f(x) is a decreasing function on the interval (2b-6, b), which simplifies to (-4, 2). Therefore, we confirm that: boxed{text{f(x) is a decreasing function on the interval (-4, 2)}}. Part 3: Finding the range of m Given f(m-2) + f(2m+1) > 0, and knowing f(x) is an odd and decreasing function, we translate the condition as f(m-2) > -f(2m+1), which simplifies to f(m-2) > f(-2m-1) due to the odd nature of f(x). Given the decreasing property of f(x), we establish the inequalities: 1. m-2 < -2m-1, 2. -2 < m-2 < 2, 3. -2 < 2m+1 < 2. Solving these inequalities, we find that 0 < m < frac{1}{3}.

The reaction is as follows: 2 HCN + CuSO4 → Cu(CN)2 + H2SO4 This equation shows that 2 moles of HCN react with 1 mole of CuSO4 to form 1 mole of Cupric Cyanide (Cu(CN)2) and 1 mole of Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4). Given that we have 4 moles of HCN and 2 moles of CuSO4, we can determine the limiting reactant by comparing the mole ratio from the balanced equation to the moles we have. From the balanced equation, the mole ratio of HCN to CuSO4 is 2:1. This means that for every 2 moles of HCN, we need 1 mole of CuSO4. We have 4 moles of HCN, which would require 2 moles of CuSO4 to completely react (since 4 moles HCN / 2 moles HCN per mole CuSO4 = 2 moles CuSO4). Since we have exactly 2 moles of CuSO4 available, all of the HCN and CuSO4 will react, and there is no limiting reactant. Now, we can calculate the moles of Cupric Cyanide formed: For every 1 mole of CuSO4, 1 mole of Cu(CN)2 is formed. We have 2 moles of CuSO4, so 2 moles of CuSO4 will form 2 moles of Cu(CN)2.

According to the problem, there are 20 more children than adults. Since there are 48 children at the matinee, the number of adults is ( 48 - 20 = 28 ). The total receipts from the adults are ( 28 ) adults times ( 6.75 ) dollars per adult, which equals ( 28 times 6.75 ). The total receipts from the children are ( 48 ) children times ( C ) dollars per child, which equals ( 48 times C ).

The area of triangle (T) can be calculated using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: [ A = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 ] where (s) is the side length of the triangle. Substitute (s = 12): [ A_T = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 12^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 144 = 36sqrt{3} ] 2. Our goal is to cut (T) into the smallest number (N) of smaller equilateral triangles with side lengths of 1, 3, or 8 such that their combined areas equal the area of (T). 3. First, calculate the areas of individual equilateral triangles with side lengths 1, 3, and 8: - For side length 1: [ A_1 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 1^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] - For side length 3: [ A_3 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 3^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 9 = frac{9sqrt{3}}{4} ] - For side length 8: [ A_8 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 8^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 64 = 16sqrt{3} ] 4. Assess the possibility of cutting the large triangle (T) into smaller triangles with these side lengths. We consider each side length case: **Case 1: Triangles with side length 3** - Each small triangle of side length 3 has area (frac{9sqrt{3}}{4}). - The number of such triangles needed to match the area of (T) is: [ frac{A_T}{A_3} = frac{36sqrt{3}}{frac{9sqrt{3}}{4}} = frac{36sqrt{3} times 4}{9sqrt{3}} = frac{144}{9} = 16 ] Therefore, (T) can be cut into 16 equilateral triangles of side length 3. 5. **Case 2: Inclusion of at least one triangle with side length 8** - Suppose we include 1 triangle with side length 8: [ text{Area of 1 triangle with side length 8} = 16sqrt{3} ] Remaining area: [ A_{text{remaining}} = 36sqrt{3} - 16sqrt{3} = 20sqrt{3} ] Calculate possible configurations of side 3 and side 1 triangles for the remaining area: [ frac{20sqrt{3}}{frac{9sqrt{3}}{4}} = frac{20sqrt{3} times 4}{9sqrt{3}} = frac{80}{9} ] Since we only can use integer values for triangles: Let (a) be the number of triangles of side length 3, then the total area they occupy is: [ 9a ] Remaining area for side 1 triangles: [ 80 - 9a ] Clearly (80 - 9a) must be a multiple of 1 (since the area of a side 1 triangle only contributes fractional amounts), allowing (a leq 8).

In the three-dimensional angle ( KANX ) (apex at ( K )), the dihedral angles at edges ( KN ) and ( KX ) are equal.

Especially, the restrictions imposed by the United States on Huawei, a Chinese company. Despite the strong blockade and pressure from the United States to resist Huawei's 5G technology, Huawei has not backed down. In 2018, Huawei not only set a record for net profit but also showed strong growth overseas. This year, a certain enterprise of Huawei in China plans to further increase its market competitiveness by producing a new smartphone using new technology in 2020. Through market analysis, it is known that to produce this new smartphone for the whole year, a fixed cost of 2.5 million needs to be invested. For each production of x (in thousand units) of the smartphone, an additional cost of R(x) million needs to be invested, where R(x)=begin{cases}10x^2+100x, & 0<x<40 701x+frac{10000}{x}9450, & xgeqslant 40end{cases}.

The revenue from selling x thousand units at 0.7 million yuan per unit is 700x million yuan. The cost includes a fixed cost of 2.5 million yuan and a variable cost of 10x^2 + 100x million yuan for 0 < x < 40. Therefore, the profit function in this range is: [ W(x) = 700x - (10x^2 + 100x + 250) = -10x^2 + 600x - 250. ] - **For x geqslant 40:** In this range, the cost function changes to 701x + frac{10000}{x} - 9450 million yuan. The profit function, therefore, becomes: [ W(x) = 700x - left(701x + frac{10000}{x} - 9450 + 250right) = -(x + frac{10000}{x}) + 9200. ] Thus, the function relationship of the profit W(x) with respect to the annual production quantity x (in thousand units) is: [ W(x) = begin{cases} -10x^2 + 600x - 250, & 0 < x < 40 -(x + frac{10000}{x}) + 9200, & x geqslant 40 end{cases}. ] **Part 2: Maximizing Profit** - **For 0 < x < 40:** To find the maximum profit in this range, we rewrite the profit function as: [ W(x) = -10(x^2 - 60x + 25) = -10(x - 30)^2 + 8750. ] This shows that the profit function reaches its maximum when x = 30 thousand units, with a maximum profit of 8750 million yuan. - **For x geqslant 40:** The profit function in this range is: [ W(x) = -(x + frac{10000}{x}) + 9200. ] By analyzing this function, we find that the maximum profit cannot exceed 9200 - 2sqrt{10000} = 9000 million yuan.

Therefore, both base angles equal y^circ, and the sum of angles in the triangle is 180^circ.

We need to determine the distance ( x ) from the base where a plane parallel to the base cuts the frustum such that the volumes of the two resulting parts are equal. 1. To begin, we need the expression for the volume ( V ) of a frustum of a square pyramid. The formula for the volume ( V ) is given by: [ V = frac{h}{3} (A_1 + A_2 + sqrt{A_1 A_2}) ] where ( h ) is the height of the frustum, ( A_1 ) is the area of the base, and ( A_2 ) is the area of the top. 2. Applying this to our case, where ( A_1 = a^2 ) and ( A_2 = b^2 ), we get: [ V = frac{m}{3} (a^2 + b^2 + ab) ] 3. We require that the frustum is bisected into two volumes that are equal. The volume of the lower part of the frustum (below the cutting plane) is given by: [ V_{text{lower}} = frac{x}{3} left( a^2 + a y + y^2 right) ] where ( x ) is the distance from the base to the cutting plane and ( y ) is the edge length of the square cross-section at height ( x ). 4. Similarly, the volume of the upper part (above the cutting plane) can be expressed as: [ V_{text{upper}} = frac{m-x}{3} left( y^2 + y b + b^2 right) ] 5. Setting ( V_{text{lower}} ) equal to ( V_{text{upper}} ): [ frac{x}{3} (a^2 + a y + y^2) = frac{m-x}{3} (y^2 + y b + b^2) ] Simplifying and multiplying through by 3: [ x (a^2 + a y + y^2) = (m - x) (y^2 + y b + b^2) ] 6. By considering the similarity of triangles within the frustum, we conclude being the geometric similarity of sections, we can express: [ frac{x}{m - x} = frac{a - y}{b - y} ] 7. This can be rewritten to solve for ( y ): [ x(b - y) = (m - x)(a - y) ] Cross-multiplying and simplifying: [ x b - x y = m a - m y - x a + x y ] Grouping the terms involving ( x ): [ b - y = frac{m a - x a - m y + x y}{x} ] 8. Solving the simplified similarity condition for ( y ): [ a^3 - y^3 = y^3 - b^3 ] Therefore, we obtain: [ y = sqrt[3]{frac{a^3 + b^3}{2}} ] 9. Using the similar triangle proportion, the distance ( x ) from the base can be derived as: [ x:m = a-y:b quad Rightarrow quad x = frac{m}{a - b}(a - y) ] 10. Substituting the value of ( y ) in the expression for ( x ): [ x = frac{m}{a - b} left( a - sqrt[3]{frac{a^3 + b^3}{2}} right) ] # Conclusion: Thus, the distance ( x ) from the base where the frustum must be cut to yield two equal volumes is: [ boxed{x = frac{m}{a - b} left( a - sqrt[3]{frac{a^3 + b^3}{2}} right)} ]"},{"prompt":"James trains for the Olympics with a rigorous schedule.

Since he takes weekends off, we only consider the weekdays: 365 days - (52 weekends * 2 days per weekend) = 365 days - 104 days = 261 weekdays Now, we need to subtract the days he doesn't train due to vacation, injuries, and competitions: - 2-week vacation: 2 weeks * 5 weekdays = 10 days - Injuries: 5 days - Competitions: 8 days Total days not training: 10 + 5 + 8 = 23 days So, the total number of weekdays he trains is: 261 weekdays - 23 days = 238 weekdays Since he trains 40 hours per week, we need to find out how many weeks' worth of training he does in those 238 days.

The probability of player A winning all three games is p^3, and the probability of player B winning all three games is (1-p)^3. - Therefore, P(X=3) = p^3 + (1-p)^3. 3. **Calculate the probability of the match ending in four games**: - The match can end in four games in two scenarios: player A wins three games and loses one, or player B wins three games and loses one. The number of ways player A can win three out of four games is C_3^1 = 3, and similarly for player B.

Since these are segments on the same edge, we have (AM + MB = a). 3. **Determining the Projections**: - The projection of point (M) vertically upwards to the top face (A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1) is the same point labeled as (M_1). - Hence, (M) projects perpendicularly above to (M_1). 4. **Using the Given Ratio**: - The ratio (MK_1) to (MN) is given as (sqrt{54}:8). 5. **Setting up the Proportion**: - From the problem, we deduce the height (h) of the cube (which equals the side length of the cube, (a)). - (MK_1) is the distance from (M) to (K_1) (in the top face) vertically.

The number of seats usually taken at each table in Group A = 8 - (1/4 * 8) = 8 - 2 = 6 seats The total number of seats usually taken in Group A = 10 tables * 6 seats/table = 60 seats For Group B: There are 7 tables with a seating capacity of 12 each. The unseated ratio is 1/3, which means 1/3 of the seats are usually unoccupied.

Similarly, for the strawberries, she gives away 1/5 of S to each friend. So, she gives away 1/5 * S * 2 = 2/5 * S strawberries in total. After giving away the strawberries, Karlee is left with S - 2/5 * S = 3/5 * S strawberries. We know that after giving away the fruits, Karlee is left with 96 fruits in total. This total is the sum of the grapes and strawberries she has left: 60 grapes + 3/5 * S strawberries = 96 fruits Now, let's solve for S: 3/5 * S = 96 - 60 3/5 * S = 36 S = 36 * 5/3 S = 12 * 5 S = 60 strawberries Karlee initially had 60 strawberries.

He broke one of the sticks into two parts such that from these two pieces and the other two whole sticks, he could make the contour of a right triangle. We are asked to determine the area of this triangle in square centimeters. 2. **Identification of Variables:** Let one of the broken pieces have length (a) and the other piece have length (24 - a). We will call these pieces the smaller sticks. The two unbroken sticks, both 24 cm long, will be called the larger sticks. 3. **Triangle Configuration Analysis:** Since the contour formed is a right-angled triangle, we need to determine which pieces make up the sides. For the triangle to be a right-angled triangle, the sides must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), where (c) is the hypotenuse and (a) and (b) are the legs. 4. **Possible Leg Combinations:** - If two smaller sticks (lengths (a) and (24-a)) are combined, the result is an equilateral triangle, which is not necessary. - If we combine two larger sticks (each 24 cm) as one side, the combined length would be 48 cm. The other sides would have lengths less than 48 cm, violating the triangle inequality theorem. Hence, only viable combination comes when one leg of the triangle is composed of a smaller stick ((a) or (24-a)) and another is a larger stick (24 cm). 5. **Determining the Third Side (Hypotenuse):** In this case, the legs become one part of the broken stick and the whole 24 cm stick, while the hypotenuse is the combined length involving another segment: Let the side lengths be: (a), (24), and (48 - a) (as the hypotenuse). 6. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:** We now set up the equation using the Pythagorean theorem on the side lengths: [ a^2 + 24^2 = (48 - a)^2 ] Expanding and solving this equation: [ a^2 + 576 = (48 - a)^2 ] [ a^2 + 576 = 2304 - 96a + a^2 ] Subtract (a^2) from both sides: [ 576 = 2304 - 96a ] Rearranging to solve for (a): [ 96a = 2304 - 576 ] [ 96a = 1728 ] [ a = frac{1728}{96} = 18 ] 7. **Triangle Verification:** Given (a = 18), the sides become: - First leg: (18) - Second leg: (24) - Hypotenuse: (48 - 18 = 30) This setup satisfies the Pythagorean theorem: [ 18^2 + 24^2 = 30^2 ] [ 324 + 576 = 900 ] [ 900 = 900 ] 8. **Calculating the Area:** The area of a right triangle is given by: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height} ] Here, base = (18) and height = (24): [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 18 times 24 = 216 ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{216} ]"},{"prompt":"For variables x and y that have a linear relationship, there is a set of observation data (x_{i},y_{i})(i=1,2,…,8), and the regression line equation is hat{y}= frac{1}{3}x+a.

In each round, the 18 teams are divided into 9 pairs, and each pair plays a match. The goal is to determine the maximum number of rounds ( n ) such that after these rounds, there exist 4 teams among which only 1 match has been played in total. Steps 1. **Define team groups**: Divide the 18 teams into two groups: Group ( A ) consisting of teams ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_9 ) and Group ( B ) consisting of teams ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_9 ). 2. **Pairing in initial rounds**: Observe how matches are conducted in the first 9 rounds: - Round 1: ((A_1, A_2), (A_3, A_4), (A_5, A_6), (A_7, A_8), (A_9, B_9), (B_1, B_2), (B_3, B_4), (B_5, B_6), (B_7, B_8)) - Continue with similarly structured rounds ensuring each team in Group ( A ) only competes within the group, and similarly for Group ( B ), across these 9 rounds. 3. **Determine matches within Group ( A ) and ( B )**: By the end of 9 rounds, every team in Group ( A ) has played against each other and all teams in Group ( B ) have played within their group as well. This means each group is fully interconnected with ( binom{9}{2} = 36 ) matches within the group. 4. **Check cross-group matches within 9 rounds**: Recall that within these first 9 rounds, the matches that happen cross-group such as ( A_9 ) playing ( B_9 ) occur minimally. 5. **Reversal for remaining rounds**: Now, reverse the assertion and perform the matches in such an order that in each round teams face others from the opposite group starting from Round 10 onwards. 6. **Ensuring minimal matches within new set**: Given the new sequence, by the 8th additional round every team in each group ( A ) or ( B ) still does not wholly compete with members of the opposite group. 7. **Identify the group of 4 teams**: Suppose after the first 7 rounds of the second half, we consider any subgroup of 4 teams out of the total 18 teams. This conditioned subgroup would have still significant unplayed matches. 8. **Verifiable Calculation**: Calculating layers of intersections and multiplicity of the cumulative matches across 7 new pairs from new config: [ text{Number of matches played by any group of 4 teams:} ] - If we choose such that the removal paradigm per round allows for only 1 intra-group match: This is a process of iterating sets ensuring only 1 cross boundary interaction after each 7 iterations, thereby creating scenarios favorable to the primary condition. 9. **Validate by contradiction if additional match sequences imposed**: Contradiction proof inferred by mismatched 4-team scenario explains if crossing 8 terms and random rounds exceed the necessary bounding intra-group for only a permissible 1 match set. 10. **Conclusion**: This can hence be analytically validated and thus: [ boxed{7} ]"},{"prompt":"At a women's doubles tennis tournament, there were four teams of two women.

Differentiating f(x) with respect to x, we get: [f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}[(x-a)e^{x+1}] - frac{d}{dx}[frac{1}{2}x^2] = (x-a+1)e^{x+1} - x.] 2. Since the tangent at x=0 is parallel to the x-axis, f'(0) = 0. Substituting x=0 into the derivative, we have: [f'(0) = (-a+1)e - 0 = 0 implies (-a+1)e = 0 implies a = 1.] 3. With a=1, the derivative simplifies to: [f'(x) = (x-1+1)e^{x+1} - x = xe^{x+1} - x = x(e^{x+1} - 1).] 4. Analyzing the sign of f'(x): - For x < -1 or x > 0, e^{x+1} - 1 > 0, so f'(x) > 0. - For -1 < x < 0, e^{x+1} - 1 < 0, so f'(x) < 0.

For -1 < x < 0, we find the derivative of g(x): [g'(x) = f'(x) + f'(-x) = xe^{x+1}(e^{2x} - 1).] 3. Since -1 < x < 0, e^{2x} - 1 < 0, but xe^{x+1} < 0, so g'(x) > 0, indicating g(x) is monotonically increasing on (-1, 0). 4. As g(0) = 0 and g(x) is increasing on (-1, 0), it follows that g(x) < 0 for all x in (-1, 0). This implies f(x) < f(-x) for all x in (-1, 0). 5. Since x_2 in (-1, 0), we have f(x_2) < f(-x_2).

Thus, the slope of tangent line l_1 is k_1 = (ax_0 + a - 1)e^{x_0}. Next, we find the derivative of the function y= frac{1-x}{e^x}: y' = (x - 2)e^{-x}. Thus, the slope of tangent line l_2 is k_2 = (x_0 - 2)e^{-x_0}. Since the two tangent lines l_1 and l_2 are perpendicular, their slopes satisfy k_1 cdot k_2 = -1. Substituting the expressions for k_1 and k_2 gives us: (ax_0 + a - 1)e^{x_0} cdot (x_0 - 2)e^{-x_0} = -1. Simplifying, we get a(x_0^2 - x_0 - 2) = x_0 - 3.

This greatest common divisor (gcd) ( R_i ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. The Euclidean algorithm ensures that ( R_i ) has integer coefficients if both ( P_i ) and ( P_i circ Q ) do. 3. **Reducibility Condition**: If ( R_i neq 1 ) (i.e., ( R_i ) is non-trivial), then ( P_i circ Q ) is not irreducible. This is because a non-trivial gcd indicates that ( P_i ) and ( P_i circ Q ) share a common factor. 4. **Identifying Common Roots**: Suppose ( P_i ) and ( P_i circ Q ) have a common root ( r ). Then, both ( P_i(r) = 0 ) and ( P_i(Q(r)) = 0 ). This implies that the polynomial ( mu_r ) (the minimal polynomial of ( r )) divides both ( P_i ) and ( P_i circ Q ), confirming a non-trivial gcd. 5. **Constructing ( Q )**: Construct the polynomial ( Q ) as follows: [ Q(X) = left( prod_{i=1}^{n} P_i(X) right) + X ] Here, ( prod_{i=1}^n P_i ) is the product of all polynomials ( P_i ). 6. **Evaluating ( Q )**: For a root ( r ) of ( P_i ): [ Q(r) = left( prod_{i=1}^n P_i(r) right) + r ] Since ( r ) is a root of ( P_i ), we have ( P_i(r) = 0 ).

Thus, the answers are x_{1}=-3 and x_{2}=-4, or encapsulated: [ boxed{x_{1}=-3, x_{2}=-4} ] 2. Given the cross fraction equation x-frac{6}{x}=-5 with solutions x_{1}=a and x_{2}=b, we identify that ab=-6 and a+b=-5.

Substituting these into frac{x_{1}+4044}{x_{2}}, we get: [ frac{2022k-2022+4044}{k+1} = frac{2022(k+1)}{k+1} = 2022 ] Thus, the value is encapsulated as: [ boxed{2022} ]"},{"prompt":"A school club collects 60 dollars to decorate their booth for a fair.

We need to show that we can choose several boxes such that the total number of balls is exactly 1001. Let's start by observing the product: [ 6 cdot 11 cdot 15 = 990 ] 3. We claim that it is possible to choose boxes such that their total number of balls is 990. Once we show this, adding one box with 11 balls will give us ( 990 + 11 = 1001 ). 4. Let's assume we pick ( x_1 ), ( y_1 ), and ( z_1 ) boxes that sum up to 990 balls: [ 6x_1 + 11y_1 + 15z_1 = 990 ] 5. We need to demonstrate the existence of non-negative integers ( x_1 ), ( y_1 ), and ( z_1 ) such that the equation above holds.

Since 7a^2 + 8ab + 4b^2 = 24, we can rewrite it as 3a^2 + 4(a + b)^2 = 24, which is equivalent to (sqrt{3}a)^2 + (2a + 2b)^2 = 24. According to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, ((sqrt{3}a)^2 + (2a + 2b)^2)((frac{1}{sqrt{3}})^2 + 1^2) geq (a + 2a + 2b)^2 = (3a + 2b)^2. Thus, (3a + 2b)^2 leq 24 times frac{4}{3} = 32.

Suppose that there were (ge 4) lattice points in the strict interior of segment (BC). Then, there exists a real number (0 < x le 0.2) so that (vec{v} = x cdot overrightarrow{BC}) is a vector with both components integral.

By Pick's Theorem, we now know that (x, y, z le frac{3}{2}). Together with (x, y, z ge frac{1}{2}), these results yield that [ frac{AP}{PE} = frac{y+z}{x} le frac{frac{3}{2} + frac{3}{2}}{frac{1}{2}} = 6. ] 7. **Impossibility of Maximum:** To show that this cannot be achieved, we need only to show that it's impossible for segments (BC, CA, AB) to have (0, 2, 2) lattice points in their strict interiors, respectively. To see this, observe that in this case we'd have that both (frac{1}{3} cdot overrightarrow{AB}, frac{1}{3} cdot overrightarrow{AC}) are vectors with both components integral, and so (A + frac{1}{3} cdot overrightarrow{AB} + frac{2}{3} cdot overrightarrow{AC}) is an interior point of (BC), contradiction.

Thus, we have: [ DK = FE quad text{and} quad DL = EF ] - Consequently, since ( DK = DL ), it implies that ( K ) and ( L ) are equidistant from ( D ). 2. Next, since the line segment ( BC ) intersects the circle (odot I) at point ( D ), the line segment ( KL ) is parallel to ( BC ). Given that ( ID perp BC ), it follows that: [ ID perp KL ] Hence, the line ( ID ) passes through the midpoint ( J ) of the chord ( KL ) on the circle (odot I). Therefore, the points ( D ), ( I ), and ( J ) are collinear. [ boxed{D, I, J text{ are collinear}} ] 3. Moving on to part (2), assume that lines ( BI ) and ( CI ) intersect ( EF ) at points ( X ) and ( Y ) respectively. - From our configuration, the points ( B ), ( C ), ( X ), and ( Y ) are concyclic (lie on a circle) denoted as (odot O). This implies that ( O ) is the midpoint of ( BC ), thus making ( O ) a fixed point. 4. Consider the perpendicular bisector ( l ) of the line segment ( XY ). This line ( l ) passes through the fixed point ( O ). Let ( AI ) intersect ( BC ) at point ( T ). - By the angle bisector theorem, we have: [ frac{BT}{TC} = frac{AB}{AC} = k ] Which shows that ( T ) is also a fixed point. 5. Since line ( AI ) is the angular bisector and lies centrally in a configuration involving reflections and symmetries, we employ another reflection centered transformation. By reflecting across the midpoint configurations of points ( E ) and ( F ), denote the reflection of ( E ) as ( M ) and of ( F ) as ( N ). The reflecting lines ( BI ) and ( CI ) yield points ( P ) and ( Q ). 6. Denote line ( l' ) as the perpendicular bisector of line segment ( PQ ). Note that ( l ) and ( l' ) are corresponding lines under reflection, hence ( l ) reflects to ( l' ). - Since lines ( AI ) and ( l ) are both perpendicular to ( EF ): [ AI parallel l parallel l' ] And the distance between ( AI ) and the lines ( l ) and ( l' ) remains invariant. 7. Lastly, consider line ( l' ) intersecting ( BC ) at point ( O' ). Since ( T ) is the midpoint of segment ( OO' ), and because all reflections are invariant while preserving distances and midpoint conditions: [ O' text{ remains a fixed point} ] Thus, the perpendicular bisector of segment ( PQ ), which is line ( l' ), always passes through the fixed point ( O' ).

The number of terms n can be found by the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where d is the common difference, which is 2 for even numbers.

Therefore, when a=1, the function y=f(x) has no extreme points. (II) To find the intervals where the function y=f(x) is monotonically increasing, we look at the derivative of the function: f'(x) = 1 - frac{a+1}{x} + frac{a}{x^2} = frac{x^2 - (a+1)x + a}{x^2} = frac{(x-1)(x-a)}{x^2}. To find the roots of the derivative, we set f'(x) = 0, yielding x_1=1 and x_2=a. For different values of a, we have: - When a leq 0, f'(x) > 0 for x > 1. The increasing interval is therefore (1, +infty). - When 0 < a < 1, f'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < a or x > 1. Therefore, the increasing intervals are (0, a) and (1, +infty). - When a = 1 (as we've seen in part I), f(x) is monotonically increasing over (0, +infty). - When a > 1, f'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1 or x > a. Thus, the increasing intervals are (0, 1) and (a, +infty). In summary: - When a leq 0, the increasing interval of the function y=f(x) is boxed{(1, +infty)}. - When 0 < a < 1, the increasing intervals of the function y=f(x) are boxed{(0, a)} and boxed{(1, +infty)}. - When a = 1, the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on boxed{(0, +infty)}. - When a > 1, the increasing intervals of the function y=f(x) are boxed{(0, 1)} and boxed{(a, +infty)}."},{"prompt":"Below is the graph of y = a csc(bx+c) for some positive constants a, b, and a phase shift c.

This can be expressed by the conditions: - sinleft(b(-frac{7pi}{3b}) + cright) = 0 - sinleft(b(frac{5pi}{3b}) + cright) = 0 Thus, solving for phase shift c: - -frac{7pi}{3} + c = -kpi (for integer k) - frac{5pi}{3} + c = -mpi (for another integer m) By adjusting these for k and m being integers, c can be determined, noting that the distance between asymptotes of csc function equals pi. Suppose k=2 for the first equation then 2pi - c = frac{7pi}{3} implies c = -frac{pi}{3}. 2. **Determine the amplitude a:** Given the minimum value of y at x=0 is the minimum value of csc function, it must be the amplitude a. Calculate y = a csc(-frac{pi}{3}). y reaches minimum positive value implies a = 2. Thus, by evaluating csc(-frac{pi}{3}) = -frac{2}{sqrt{3}} (using value from standard trigonometric function table), solve a times (-frac{2}{sqrt{3}}) = 2. Thus, a = -sqrt{3}.

This set of squares for the first row satisfies the requirement. 2. **First Column Construction:** Choose the first column's entries from the sequence of squares of powers of 2 up to ( 2^{12}): [ begin{aligned} &2^2 = 4, &2^4 = 16, &2^6 = 64, &2^8 = 256, &2^{10} = 1024, &2^{12} = 4096, &2^{14} = 16384, end{aligned} ] Calculate their sum: [ 1 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 + 1024 + 4096 + 16384 = 5461 ] Now, if we add the last element to achieve an integer solution, we would pick: [ k^2 = left(2730right)^2 ] Then, the first column sums to: [ (2k+1) + k^2 = 2731^2 ] 3. **Matrix Filling:** For each element not in the first row or column, compute: [ a_{ij} = a_{1j} times a_{i1} ] Given that both terms are squares, their product is also a square. Each row's and each column's sums now need verification: - Each row's sum equals the product of the sum of the first row squares and the square at (a_{i1}). - Each column's sum equals the product of the sum of the first column squares and the square at (a_{1j}). Both sums are squares since they result from squaring a sum. 4. **Uniqueness Check:** Verify if the elements are unique across the (8 times 8) grid: - Row elements are distinct as sums involve unique prime factors and powers. - Column elements are different since they progressively increase. - The highest element from the first seven rows (19^2 times 2^{12}) is smaller than the smallest element in the last row, (2730^2).

No three points are collinear. 2. Together with any three points of the given set, the orthocenter of the triangle formed by these points also lies within the set. We'll systematically explore the solution: Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define the Points Set**: Let ( M ) be the given set of points on the plane with the properties stated above. 2. **Convex Hull ( V )**: Consider the convex hull ( V ) of this set ( M ). ( V ) is a polygon that represents the smallest convex set containing all points in ( M ). 3. **Properties of Vertex Angles**: The polygon ( V ) cannot have any obtuse angles. To see why, suppose ( A, B, C ) are three consecutive vertices of ( V ), and the angle ( angle ABC ) is obtuse. The orthocenter of triangle ( ABC ) would lie outside the polygon ( V ), which contradicts the requirement that the orthocenter must lie within the set. Therefore, ( V ) is either a right or an acute-angled triangle or a quadrilateral with all angles being right angles i.e., a square. 4. **Case Analysis**: Let's analyze the sets ( M ) that meet these requirements for different possible shapes of ( V ): a. **Acute-Angled Triangle**: - Consider an acute-angled triangle ( Delta ABC ) with orthocenter ( H ). - The orthocenter ( H ) lies inside ( Delta ABC ). - Suppose there is an additional point ( K ) inside ( V ) apart from ( A, B, C, ) and ( H ). - Point ( K ) must lie in one of the sub-triangles ( ABH, BCH, CAH ). - For example, assuming ( K ) lies inside ( BCH ), we consider the angle properties: [ angle BAC + angle BHC = 180^circ. ] - Since ( K ) lies inside ( BCH ): [ angle BHC < angle BKC. ] - The orthocenter ( L ) of ( Delta BCK ) would then lie outside ( V ), leading to contradiction. Therefore, other than the vertices ( A, B, C ) and the orthocenter ( H ), no additional point can belong to ( M ). b. **Right-Angled Triangle**: - In a right-angled triangle, the orthocenter coincides with the vertex forming the right angle. Therefore, it suffices to consider only the three vertices to form the required set ( M ): [ M = {A, B, C}. ] c. **Square**: - For a square, the orthocenter of any triangle formed by three of its vertices will also be one of the vertices. - Therefore, the set ( M ) will consist of the four vertices of the square: [ M = {A, B, C, D}. ] Conclusion: The finite sets of points ( M ) that satisfy the conditions are: 1. The three vertices of an acute-angled triangle and its orthocenter. 2. The three vertices of a right-angled triangle. 3. The four vertices of a square. Thus, the answer is: (boxed{text{Three vertices and the orthocenter of an acute-angled triangle, three vertices of a right-angled triangle, or the four vertices of a square.}})"},{"prompt":"Given a triangle, construct three circles in such a way that each circle is tangent to the other two circles and to two sides of the triangle.","completion":"1.

By similarity of triangles ADK and AEO: [ r_1 = frac{xr}{s} ] Similarly, by the similarity of triangles BFL and BEO: [ r_2 = frac{yr}{t} ] 6. Since AB = AD + DF + FB, substituting and rearranging: [ x + y + 2sqrt{r_1 r_2} = s + t ] Substitute r_1 and r_2: [ x + y + frac{2r}{sqrt{st}}sqrt{xy} = s + t ] 7.

The sum of the coordinates of point D is: [ 2 + 18 = boxed{20} ]"},{"prompt":"An engineering student has to secure a certain percentage of marks to pass. He gets 130 marks and fails by 14 marks. The maximum number of marks obtained by him is 400. What percentage of marks does he need to pass?","completion":"To find out the percentage of marks the student needs to pass, we first need to determine the number of marks required to pass. The student gets 130 marks and fails by 14 marks, which means if he had obtained 14 more marks, he would have passed. So, the passing marks would be: 130 marks (marks obtained) + 14 marks (marks needed to pass) = 144 marks Now, we need to find out what percentage 144 marks is out of the maximum marks, which is 400. To find the percentage, we use the formula: Percentage = (Value / Total Value) * 100 In this case, the value is the passing marks (144), and the total value is the maximum marks (400). Percentage = (144 / 400) * 100 Now, let's calculate the percentage: Percentage = (0.36) * 100 Percentage = 36% Therefore, the student needs to secure boxed{36%} of the total marks to pass."},{"prompt":"f 2 ^ 2n + 2 ^ 2n + 2 ^ 2n + 2 ^ 2n = 4 ^ 18, what is the value of n?","completion":"Let's first simplify the left side of the equation by factoring out the common term (2^{2n}): [2^{2n} + 2^{2n} + 2^{2n} + 2^{2n} = 4 cdot 2^{2n}] Since (4 = 2^2), we can rewrite the equation as: [4 cdot 2^{2n} = (2^2)^{2n}] Now, let's rewrite the right side of the equation using the property of exponents that states ((a^b)^c = a^{bc}): [(2^2)^{2n} = 2^{2 cdot 2n} = 2^{4n}] Now we have: [2^{4n} = 4^{18}] Since (4 = 2^2), we can rewrite (4^{18}) as ((2^2)^{18}), and using the property of exponents again: [(2^2)^{18} = 2^{2 cdot 18} = 2^{36}] Now we have: [2^{4n} = 2^{36}] For the bases and exponents to be equal, the exponents must be equal: [4n = 36] Now we can solve for (n): [n = frac{36}{4}] [n = 9] So the value of (n) is boxed{9} ."},{"prompt":"Given that f(θ)= dfrac {2cos ^{2}θ+sin ^{2}(2πθ)+sin ( dfrac {π}{2}+θ)3}{2+2cos ^{2}(π+θ)+cos (θ)}, find the value of f( dfrac {π}{3}).
