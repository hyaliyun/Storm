Non era mia intenzione inserirlo ma forse i giocatori non apprezzerebbero una ambientazione in cui c'è \\"solo\\" questo","completion":"Per conferire quel necessario effetto \\"wow\\" e includere elementi che amplifichino il fascino dell'ambientazione senza necessariamente virare verso il puramente sovrannaturale, potresti considerare alcune direzioni che rimangono fedeli allo spirito sci-fi/horror mantenendo una certa originalità. Ecco alcune idee che potresti esplorare: # Relitti Spaziali Ancestrali Immersi nei confini più remoti dell'universo conosciuto, esistono antichi relitti spaziali, vestigia di civiltà estinte o scomparse. Queste navi, stazioni o artefatti, avanzati oltre l'immaginazione, potrebbero conferire poteri o conoscenze inimmaginabili a chi riesce a decifrarne i segreti. Tali relitti potrebbero essere oggetto di caccia da parte di avventurieri, governi e corporazioni, tutti desiderosi di sbloccare le tecnologie perdute. # Fenomeni Cosmici Misteriosi Fenomeni spaziali sconosciuti e inesplorati, come buchi neri vaganti, nebulose che alterano la mente, o onde gravitazionali che piegano il tempo, offrono un terreno di gioco ricco per avventure che sfidano le leggi della fisica come le conosciamo. Questi fenomeni potrebbero avere effetti singolari sui viaggi spaziali, sulla psiche umana o sulle leggi della natura, inserendo un elemento di meraviglia e pericolo. # Specie Aliene Enigmatiche L'incontro con specie aliene antiche o superiori, che sfuggono alla comprensione umana, può introdurre una dimensione sovrannaturale senza abbandonare il contesto sci-fi. Queste entità potrebbero comunicare in modi impensabili, offrire tecnologie che sfidano la comprensione o persino manipolare la realtà stessa. La loro presenza potrebbe essere venerata, temuta o entrambe le cose. # Tecnologie Indistinguibili dalla Magia Sfruttando l'adagio di Arthur C. Clarke che \\"qualsiasi tecnologia sufficientemente avanzata è indistinguibile dalla magia\\", potresti introdurre artefatti o sistemi tecnologici che sfidano la comprensione umana e sembrano sovrannaturali. Questo potrebbe includere dispositivi capaci di alterare la realtà, simulacri coscienti che esistono nel tessuto dello spaziotempo, o macchine che influenzano le probabilità. # Il Biologico Incontra il Tecnologico: Bioingegneria Explora l'idea di vita creata o alterata attraverso la bioingegneria, che confonde i confini tra naturale e artificiale. Creature o umani geneticamente modificati con capacità che sfidano ogni logica potrebbero aggiungere un elemento di meraviglia e orrore. Questi esseri potrebbero essere il risultato di esperimenti perduti, antiche biotecnologie alieni o il prossimo passo nell'evoluzione umana. # Il Potere dimenticato della Mente La psionica o le abilità psichiche potrebbero costituire una frontiera scientifica poco compresa. Umani o alieni con tali abilità sfidano il confine tra scienza e sovrannaturale, offrendo opportunità per esplorare poteri quali telepatia, telecinesi, premonizioni o controllo degli elementi, mantenendo una patina di scientificità attraverso il concetto di evoluzione neurologica o manipolazione genetica. Inserendo uno o più di questi elementi nel tuo universo, puoi arricchire l'esperienza di gioco con sfide inedite e momenti di puro stupore, mantenendo i giocatori agganciati al desiderio di scoprire quali altri segreti si celino nel tessuto stesso della tua narrazione. Questo approccio permette di mantenere una solida base scientifica o semi-scientifica, rimanendo fedele al genere sci-fi/horror, ma con quella spinta verso il \\"wow\\" che cerchi."},{"prompt":"i vari pianeti potrebbero aver avuto effetti imprevisti sull'evoluzione dell'essere umano conferendogli delle capacità?","completion":"Sì, l'idea che diversi ambienti planetari possano avere effetti significativi sull'evoluzione dell'essere umano, conferendogli capacità uniche, è un concetto affascinante e molto fertile per la tua ambientazione di gioco. Questo concetto permette non solo di esplorare la diversità umana in un contesto interstellare, ma aggiunge anche un livello di profondità scientifica e fantastica allo stesso tempo, offrendo nuove dinamiche per il gameplay e per la narrazione. Ecco come potrebbe funzionare: # Adattamento Ambientale Su ogni pianeta, le condizioni ambientali specifiche — come la gravità, l'atmosfera, i livelli di radiazione, o la presenza di flora e fauna particolari — potrebbero stimolare adattamenti genetici o fisiologici negli esseri umani che vi abitano. Questi adattamenti potrebbero evolversi nel corso di molte generazioni o, in un contesto di avanzata manipolazione genetica, potrebbero essere ingegnerizzati deliberatamente. Esempi di capacità potrebbero includere: - **Affinità con ambienti estremi:** Abitanti di pianeti caldi o freddi potrebbero sviluppare una maggiore resistenza o tolleranza agli estremi termici, mentre quelli dei pianeti con ambienti tossici potrebbero sviluppare un sistema immunitario estremamente avanzato. - **Gravità e forza fisica:** Su pianeti con gravità maggiore rispetto alla Terra, gli umani potrebbero diventare più forti fisicamente, adattandosi all'ambiente ad alta pressione. Al contrario, in pianeti con minore gravità, potrebbero sviluppare una maggiore agilità o la capacità di compiere salti incredibili. - **Sensi potenziati:** L'esposizione a condizioni ambientali particolari potrebbe portare allo sviluppo di sensi acuti, come la vista in condizioni di bassa illuminazione per gli abitanti di pianeti con scarsa luce solare, o un olfatto particolarmente sviluppato utile per rilevare gas pericolosi. # Capacità Psichiche o Cognitive Oltre agli adattamenti fisici, potresti esplorare come l'esposizione a certi elementi o condizioni cosmiche potrebbe alterare o potenziare le capacità cognitive o psichiche degli esseri umani: - **Telepatia e Empatia:** In società densamente popolate o in ambienti in cui la comunicazione verbale è difficoltosa, alcuni individui potrebbero sviluppare capacità telepatiche o una sensibilità empatica percepibile, per migliorare le interazioni sociali e la collaborazione. - **Capacità Mnemoniche Avanzate:** Sopravvivere in ambienti ostili potrebbe richiedere una capacità di apprendimento e memoria superiore. Gli esseri umani in questi ambienti potrebbero sviluppare abilità mnemoniche avanzate, diventando viventi archivi di conoscenza. - **Premonizioni o Sensibilità Temporale:** L'esposizione a strane anomalie cosmiche o fenomeni gravitazionali unici potrebbe dotare alcuni individui di una sensibilità temporale, permettendo loro di avere visioni del futuro imminente o di percepire le linee temporali in modi che sfuggono agli altri umani. Integrare questi concetti nel tuo gioco offre un'ampia gamma di opportunità per meccaniche innovative e storie avvincenti. Gli adattamenti potrebbero giocare un ruolo centrale nelle dinamiche sociali, politiche ed economiche dei vari mondi, creando un ambiente ricco e stratificato per avventure epiche. I giocatori potrebbero dover navigare sfide uniche basate sugli adattamenti di personaggi non giocanti (NPC) specifici di certi ambienti o imparare a utilizzare le proprie capacità evolute per superare ostacoli e risolvere enigmi."},{"prompt":"e inserire qualche cosa collegato ad entità eterne, dei cosmici ecc? sempre sullo sfondo, non deve essere centrale e deve servire per dare più possibilità","completion":"L'introduzione di entità eterne o dei cosmici può arricchire notevolmente l'ambientazione del tuo gioco, fornendo un misterioso substrato di mitologia e leggenda che i giocatori possono esplorare e a cui possono collegarsi nel corso delle loro avventure. Questi esseri possono servire come catalizzatori per eventi nel gioco, fonti di potere misteriose, o semplicemente come elementi che aggiungono profondità e meraviglia all'universo narrativo. Ecco alcune idee su come potresti integrarli: # Entità Cosmiche come Forza Motrice nel Retroscena Potresti introdurre queste entità come figure mitiche, le cui azioni e volontà hanno plasmato la storia dell'universo e dei suoi abitanti. Forse sono responsabili dell'esistenza dei vari fenomeni spaziali anomali o hanno influenzato l'evoluzione delle specie intelligenti. Questi esseri possono essere conosciuti attraverso antiche leggende, artefatti misteriosi, o rari incontri diretti che sollevano più domande di quante ne rispondano. # Dei Cosmici come Fonti di Conflitto Senza diventare il fulcro centrale della narrativa, queste entità possono comunque influenzare gli eventi correnti in modi sottili. Diverse fazioni possono adorare diverse entità, interpretando i loro desideri o comandi in vari modi, e portando a conflitti ideologici, guerre sante, o missioni per recuperare artefatti sacri. Questo permette ai giocatori di interfacciarsi con il divino o l'eterno in maniera indiretta, attraverso le loro scelte e azioni. # Entità come Patroni o Antagonisti Alcuni giocatori o NPC potrebbero avere legami speciali con queste entità, visti sia come benedizioni che come maledizioni. Questi legami possono offrire poteri unici o informazioni preziose, ma possono anche attirare pericoli, rivali e sfide legate al patto o all'alleanza con un'entità cosmica. Ciò potrebbe anche introdurre dilemmi morali: fino a che punto si può spingersi per mantenere o utilizzare una tale connessione? # Entità Eterne come Misteri da Svelare Le entità eterne possono essere avvolte in mistero, con le loro vere nature, motivazioni e storie nascoste ai più. Questo può portare i giocatori in un viaggio di scoperta, seguendo indizi sparsi per l'universo, decifrando antichi manoscritti o confrontandosi con custodi del sapere. L'obiettivo non è necessariamente comprendere completamente queste figure, ma piuttosto esplorare come la loro esistenza influenzi l'universo, dando vita a situazioni uniche di gioco. # Elementi di Gameplay Nell'implementazione di tali entità, considera come possono influenzare meccaniche specifiche di gioco, come: - **Effetti ambientali speciali:** zone influenzate dalla presenza o dalle energie di un'entità cosmica, che offrono sfide uniche o modificano le capacità dei personaggi. - **Missioni e obiettivi:** ricerche di artefatti, santuari o luoghi di potere collegati a queste entità, che possono portare a sfide, enigmi o incontri speciali. - **Poteri e malus:** connessioni personali o di gruppo con un'entità che possono conferire benefici unici ma anche richiedere sacrifici o comportare rischi specifici. Integrare entità eterne o dei cosmici come parte del panorama più ampio della tua ambientazione offre un modo per immergere i giocatori in un universo pieno di meraviglie e pericoli insondabili, laddove la scoperta e il mistero abbondano ad ogni angolo della galassia. Questo, mantenendo questi elementi sullo sfondo, permette di preservare il mistero e il senso di scoperta, mantenendo i giocatori coinvolti e curiosi su cosa ancora ci sia da scoprire."},{"prompt":"alternative? potenziamenti tecnologici alla cyberpunk?","completion":"Incorporare potenziamenti tecnologici in stile cyberpunk offre un'altra strada affascinante per arricchire la tua ambientazione sci-fi/horror, mantenendola ancorata a temi scientifici e tecnologici e offrendo sfide e opportunità uniche ai giocatori. Questi potenziamenti possono variare da miglioramenti fisici a interfaccia neurale avanzata, dando vita a una gamma di dinamiche di gameplay emozionanti. Ecco alcuni spunti su come implementarli: # Potenziamenti Cybernetici - **Implanti Fisici:** Braccia meccaniche, occhi bionici con capacità di visione termica o notturna, cuori artificiali che migliorano la resistenza fisica. Questi impianti possono offrire ai giocatori abilità uniche o vantaggi in particolari situazioni, come una forza sovrumana o la capacità di vedere in ambienti bui. - **Interfacce Cervello-Computer:** Connessioni dirette tra il cervello e dispositivi elettronici, permettendo ai personaggi di interfacciarsi con reti dati, controllare remotamente veicoli o armi e accedere a vasti archivi di conoscenza istantaneamente. - **Modificazioni Genetico-Cibernetiche:** Incorporando elementi di bioingegneria, i personaggi potrebbero ricevere iniezioni di nanomacchine che riparano tessuti danneggiati, potenziano la forza muscolare, o modificano temporaneamente il loro DNA per adattarsi a specifici ambienti o compiti. # Gear e Tecnologia Avanzata - **Armature potenziate:** Tute esoscheletriche che non solo offrono protezione dai danni, ma anche amplificano le capacità fisiche dell'indossatore, consentendo loro di sollevare oggetti pesanti o sopravvivere in condizioni ambientali estreme. - **Armi High-Tech:** Armi personalizzabili con tecnologia avanzata, inclusi sistemi di puntamento intelligenti, munizioni guidate, o armi non letali che inducono paralisi o disorientamento. - **Strumenti di Hacking e Sorveglianza:** Kit per l'hacking avanzati per infiltrarsi in sistemi di sicurezza, dispositivi di ascolto per intercettazioni, e droni per la ricognizione o assistenza in combattimento. # Tematiche Etiche e Morali L'introduzione di potenziamenti cibernetici apre anche la porta a profonde questioni etiche e morali, perfette per arricchire la trama e sviluppare i personaggi: - **Identità e Umanità:** Fino a che punto un essere può essere potenziato prima di perdere la propria umanità? Questa domanda può generare intense discussioni e dilemmi morali per i giocatori e i personaggi non giocanti (NPC). - **Accessibilità e Disuguaglianza:** L'accesso a questi potenziamenti potrebbe essere limitato ai ricchi o al potere militare/ corporativo, creando una disparità significativa tra chi può permetterseli e chi no. Questo può alimentare tensioni sociali, criminalità e la trama per varie missioni o campagne. - **Dipendenza e Controllo:** La dipendenza da tecnologia potenziante o il potenziale controllo remoto di individui potenziati possono costituire interessanti dilemmi o pericoli. Chi controlla gli impianti? Cosa impedisce che un personaggio venga \\"hackerato\\"? Incorporando questi elementi nell'ambientazione, puoi creare un mondo ricco di sfide tecniche e morali, stimolando i giocatori a pensare in modo creativo e a valutare le implicazioni delle scelte tecnologiche sia a livello personale che a livello di società. L'estetica e il tema cyberpunk si prestano eccezionalmente bene a esplorare la tensione tra l'avanzamento tecnologico e l'integrità umana, creando un'ambientazione complessa e coinvolgente per un'esperienza di gioco memorabile."},{"prompt":"non lo so, mi piacerebbe avere un effetto wow nuovo","completion":"Capisco la tua ricerca di un \\"effetto wow\\" unico, un elemento che possa davvero distinguere la tua ambientazione e stupire i giocatori con qualcosa di fresco e inaspettato. Considera quindi l'idea di integrare un elemento innovativo che intreccia le dimensioni della realtà, della tecnologia e della percezione, creandone una che sia più grande della loro somma. Ecco un'idea che potrebbe servire a questo scopo: # Realità Fratturata e Dimensioni Sovrapposte Immagina un universo dove i confini tra dimensioni diverse si sono assottigliati o persino infranti in certi punti critici, forse a causa di un'esperimento cosmico andato storto, un evento naturale di proporzioni epiche, o l'intervento di un'entità oltre la comprensione umana. Questi punti di frattura potrebbero apparire in vari luoghi dei pianeti conosciuti, creando zone di sovrapposizione dimensionale che alterano la realtà in modi straordinari: - **Alterazione Percettiva:** In queste zone, la percezione del tempo e dello spazio può essere radicalmente diversa. Ciò che sembra un breve passaggio può in realtà durare ore o giorni in \\"realtà standard\\", e movimenti che sembrano coprire metri possono estendersi su chilometri. - **Manifestazioni Fisiche:** Le leggi della fisica potrebbero comportarsi in modo imprevedibile. Forse la gravità inverte la sua direzione in modo aleatorio, l'energia fluisce in forma visibile, o la materia si comporta in maniera contraria alle aspettative normali (l'acqua diventa solida nell'aria, le strutture solide si liquefano, ecc.). - **Intersezioni di Esistenze:** Creature o entità di altre dimensioni possono apparire, interagire o interferire con la realtà conosciuta. Questi incontri potrebbero variare dal meravigliosamente magico all'estremamente pericoloso. - **Nuove Forme di Viaggio e Comunicazione:** La scoperta e l'esplorazione di queste zone potrebbero portare allo sviluppo di nuove tecnologie o metodi per viaggiare tra le stelle o comunicare attraverso le barriere dimensionali, ampliando enormemente le potenzialità dell'esplorazione spaziale e interspaziale. # Gameplay e Narrazione - **Esplorazione Multidimensionale:** Incoraggia i giocatori ad esplorare queste aree fratturate in cerca di risorse, conoscenze o la chiave per prevenire un disastro cosmico imminente. Ogni zona potrebbe avere le sue regole uniche, sfidando i giocatori a pensare in modo creativo per navigare e sopravvivere. - **Missioni Dinamiche:** Le missioni potrebbero cambiare basandosi sulla realtà dimensionale in cui si trovano i giocatori. Una missione che appare semplice in una dimensione potrebbe diventare una corsa contro il tempo in un'altra, o rivelare segreti e sfide nascoste visibili solo da specifiche prospettive dimensionali. - **Poteri e Tecnologie**: I giocatori potrebbero sbloccare poteri unici o ottenere tecnologie che permettono loro di interagire con queste realtà fratturate in modi nuovi, come spostarsi tra diverse dimensioni, manipolare il tempo per pochi secondi, o vedere potenziali futuri. Questa idea mira a creare un universo in cui il concetto di realtà è fluido e plurale, offrendo ai giocatori la possibilità di sperimentare e influenzare la narrazione in modi precedentemente inimmaginabili, generando continuamente quegli \\"effetti wow\\" attraverso la scoperta di nuove dimensioni della realtà e delle sue straordinarie possibilità."},{"prompt":"non mi piace","completion":"Capisco, trovare l'effetto \\"wow\\" giusto per la tua ambientazione può essere una vera sfida, e non tutte le idee faranno centro con ciò che hai in mente. Esploriamo allora un'altra direzione che potrebbe offrire quell'unicità e fascino che stai cercando, concentrandoci su aspetti meno esplorati o combinazioni innovative di concetti: # Singolarità Culturale: Eredità delle Civiltà Perdute Una direzione che potrebbe insufflare vita nuova e dare un distintivo effetto \\"wow\\" al tuo universo è quella di scoprire e interagire con le sagge e misteriose eredità lasciate da antiche civiltà aliene da tempo estinte o scomparse. Non semplici rovine o artefatti, ma intere città, ecosistemi, o addirittura leggi fisiche alterate e personalizzate, sepolte o celate, in attesa di essere scoperte. Ecco come questo concetto potrebbe essere messo in gioco: Città Nascoste e Tecnologie Perdute Immagina cittadelle antiche fluttuanti nello spazio profondo, celate all'interno di asteroidi vaganti o tuffate negli abissi di pianeti oceanici, tutte mantenute in uno stato di stasi o invisibilità grazie a una tecnologia indistinguibile dalla magia. Il ritrovamento e l'esplorazione di una di queste città potrebbero offrire accesso a conoscenze scientifiche e magiche che sfidano l'immaginazione, fondendo scienza e misticismo in modi nuovi e inaspettati. Leggi Fisiche Localizzate Le antiche civiltà potrebbero aver modificato le leggi della fisica in aree specifiche per adattarle ai propri bisogni o per esperimenti ora dimenticati. Ad esempio, potresti trovare una zona dove la gravità funziona in modo radicale diverso, o dove l'energia e la materia si intrecciano in modi che permettono la creazione \\"magica\\" di oggetti o esseri. Questi siti diventerebbero luoghi di incredibile importanza, strategici, scientifici o anche sacri. Simbiosi con Intelligenze Artificiali Ancestrali E se le antiche civiltà avessero lasciato dietro di sé non solo tecnologie ma anche intelligenze artificiali avanzate, esseri di pura informazione e luce, in attesa di nuovi interlocutori? Il contatto con queste IA potrebbe sbloccare nuovi percorsi di evoluzione per la civiltà umana, offrendo consulenza, collaborazione o, in casi più sinistri, tentativi di manipolazione o di fusione tra uomo e macchina a livelli mai visti prima. Portali Stellari e Viaggi Istantanei L'antica tecnologia potrebbe comprendere dispositivi che permettono il viaggio istantaneo tra punti dell'universo, non semplici teletrasportatori, ma veri e propri portali che collegano mondi lontani attraverso \\"strade stellari\\" predefinite. Questi portali non solo sconvolgerebbero le dinamiche di viaggio e commercio, ma potrebbero anche fungere da chiavi narrative per campagne che esplorano le molteplici culture e specie dell'universo, nonché le potenziali minacce nascoste tra le stelle. Integrando elementi come questi, il tuo universo acquisirebbe un velo di mistero e meraviglia profonda, offrendo ai giocatori la possibilità di scoprire e interagire con segreti che trasformano la comprensione stessa della realtà e del loro posto in essa. Un viaggio veramente \\"wow\\" che amalgama la scoperta scientifica con il senso di avventura e il sublime, creando un'esperienza unica per tutti i partecipanti."},{"prompt":"ok qua siamo su \\"stargate\\". credo mi serva qualcosa che offra la prospettiva di fare dei personaggi potenti o che possano migliorare","completion":"Capendo la ricerca di un elemento che permetta ai giocatori di sentire la crescita in potenza dei loro personaggi e offra una progressione tangibile, un'idea innovativa potrebbe essere l'adozione di un sistema di \\"Eredità Tecnologica e Conoscitiva\\". Questo sistema permetterebbe ai personaggi di sbloccare e migliorare le loro capacità tramite la scoperta, l'apprendimento, e l'assimilazione di tecnologie e conoscenze perdute, avanzate o altrimenti inaccessibili. Vediamo come potrebbe funzionare in un contesto sci-fi/horror: # Eredità Tecnologica e Conoscitiva Conoscenza Incapsulata I personaggi possono trovare \\"capsule di conoscenza\\", dispositivi o reliquie antiche che, una volta interfacciate con la mente o il corpo di un personaggio, gli trasmettono abilità, ricordi o conoscenze avanzate. Queste possono variare dall'abilità di comprendere e parlare lingue dimenticate, fino alla comprensione intuitiva di principi scientifici avanzati che possono conferire vantaggi tangibili, come la creazione di nuove tecnologie o potenziamenti. Bio-Integrazione Attraverso la bio-ingegneria e la nano-tecnologia, i personaggi hanno la possibilità di integrare biologicamente sistemi avanzati dentro di sé, ottenendo miglioramenti fisici, sensoriali, o mentali. Questo processo potrebbe richiedere la scoperta di tecnologie perdute o la collaborazione con entità avanzate. Oltre a offrire potenziamenti come forza sovrumana o velocità, potrebbe concedere capacità uniche come la manipolazione di campi energetici, la telepatia o persino la guarigione rapida. Simbionti Alieni o Nanotecnologici Introduci l'idea di simbionti (organici o nanotecnologici) che i personaggi possono scegliere di accogliere dentro di sé. Questi simbionti offrono poteri o abilità in cambio di una convivenza simbiotica. Gli effetti potrebbero essere la capacità di sopravvivere nel vuoto spaziale, oppure nuove modalità di percezione come vedere spettri di luce non visibili a occhi umani o di connessione mentale con le reti tecnologiche. Artefatti dell'Ascesa I personaggi possono cercare e collezionare artefatti unici, ognuno dei quali offre potenziamenti o abilità specifiche. Questi oggetti potrebbero essere rarissimi e richiedere grandi imprese per essere ottenuti, come decifrare antichi codici stellari, esplorare pericolose rovine aliene o superare prove concepite da civiltà estinte per testare i degni. Albero di Evoluzione Personalizzato Permetti ai giocatori di disegnare il percorso evolutivo dei loro personaggi tramite un \\"albero di evoluzione\\" personalizzato, che combina elementi delle categorie sopra. Questo albero consente di pianificare e personalizzare lo sviluppo del personaggio basandosi sulle loro esperienze, le conoscenze acquisite, e gli artefatti ottenuti durante le avventure. L'albero potrebbe avere rami dedicati a miglioramenti fisici, mentali, tecnologici e misteriosi (magici, se vuoi mantenere un sapore di ancient technology). L'introduzione di questi elementi offre ai giocatori non solo la prospettiva di fare dei personaggi potenti ma anche una progressione tangibile e personalizzabile che tiene conto dell'esplorazione, dell'apprendimento e delle scelte fatte, perfettamente integrata in un contesto narrativo ricco e intrigante."},{"prompt":"se ammetiamo una tecnologia simile a quella presente nel ciclo di fondazione di asimov possiamo ipotizzare qualche potenziamento o protesi?","completion":"Assolutamente, ispirandoci alla tecnologia avanzata simile a quella descritta nel Ciclo di Fondazione di Isaac Asimov, possiamo esplorare diverse possibilità di potenziamenti o protesi che si adattano bene a un contesto di gioco role-playing ricco di azione, avventura e mistero. Concentriamoci su come questa tecnologia può essere integrata per fornire ai personaggi dei miglioramenti significativi, pur rimanendo coerenti con un universo di stampo fantascientifico sofisticato e intellettuale. # Potenziamenti Neurali **Interfacce Mentali:** Ispirandoci alla psicostoria e alla manipolazione delle masse di Asimov, possiamo concepire impianti neurali che migliorano le capacità analitiche e predittive del personaggio. Questi dispositivi potrebbero consentire ai personaggi di analizzare rapidamente grandi quantità di dati, prevedere probabili esiti di eventi o migliorare le capacità di persuasione e manipolazione. **Simulacri Olistici:** Prendendo spunto dalla capacità di Asimov di creare visioni di vasti imperi galattici, potremmo immaginare una protesi che permette agli utenti di creare simulazioni virtuali complesse nella loro mente per pianificare o prevedere scenari di vario tipo, dalla costruzione di una nave spaziale al disegno di una campagna militare. # Protesi Fisiche **Membri Bionici Avanzati:** Oltre alle normali funzionalità fisiche, queste protesi potrebbero incorporare tecnologie avanzate come campi di forza personali per la difesa, dispositivi di camuffamento o la capacità di interagire direttamente con altre forme di tecnologia attraverso link wireless. **Moduli di Adattamento Ambientale:** Protesi che permettono ai personaggi di sopravvivere e operare in una vasta gamma di ambienti, dall'esposizione al vuoto dello spazio a pianeti con atmosfere tossiche o temperature estreme. Questi moduli potrebbero incorporare sistemi di supporto vitale, adattamento gravitazionale e filtri atmosferici. # Potenziamenti Cognitivi **Amplificatori di Intelligenza:** Sfruttando il tema della super-intelligenza, questi dispositivi potrebbero potenziare temporaneamente le capacità cognitive del personaggio, consentendo lampi di genio, comprensione intuitiva di tecnologie aliene o lingue sconosciute, e accelerazione dei processi di pensiero. **Reti di Conoscenza Condivisa:** Potenziamenti che consentono agli utenti di connettersi a reti di dati o a coscienze collettive, permettendo lo scambio di esperienze, conoscenze o la capacità di coordinare azioni complesse in tempo reale con precisione senza precedenti. # Tecno-Magia **Proiettori di Realtà Quantistica:** Ispirandosi alla capacità di Asimov di fondere scienza con elementi che sfidano la nostra comprensione, questi strumenti permetterebbero ai personaggi di alterare leggermente le probabilità a loro favore o di compiere azioni che appaiono quasi magiche, ma sono ancorate in una complessa scienza quantistica che solo pochi possono realmente comprendere o manipolare. Integrando questi potenziamenti o protesi nel tuo gioco, puoi offrire ai giocatori un senso tangibile di crescita e scoperta, spingendoli a esplorare i limiti della scienza fiction e a interagire con il tuo universo in modi sempre nuovi e straordinari. La chiave sta nel bilanciare l'accesso a tali tecnologie con sfide che richiedono ingegno, adattabilità e collaborazione, mantenendo così la tensione narrativa e il senso di meraviglia."},{"prompt":"Напиши сценарий на две страницы по документальному фильму «Юрий Левитанский.

In the UK alone, 9.5 million tonnes of food waste is produced, which not only releases 36 million tonnes of CO2 emission equivalents, but it also costs the government £19 billion[2]. This is not acceptable in a world where up to 783 million people have limited access to food[3], especially when 70% of this waste could have been eaten[2]. The vast amount of food waste also does not fall in line with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 12.3 (‘By 2030 halve per capita global food waste… and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses’), where it has only reduced by 13.2% globally[4]; with less than 7 years left of the SDGs implementation, drastic changes must happen in the near future in order to reach this target. Approximately 14% of food produced is lost between harvest and retail[5]. In the case of fruits this is generated with processing (e.g. pre-cut fruit) before being put on retail, being purposely thrown away due to aesthetics or spoiling before reaching retail[6]. Processed fruit creates 2 types of waste: liquid waste, as a result of juicing and water used to wash the fruit, and solid waste, for example the peel that can equate up to 60% of the solid waste of a fruit[7]. The amount of solid fruit waste generated can be reduced by valorisation to recycle the waste material for useful products; an example is to extract compounds that can be used in multiple industries, such as using oils extracted from the seed for semisolids[8]. Mangoes (Mangifera indica) are an interesting fruit with high solid waste valorising potential. There are many cultivars of mangoes harvested around the world, such as Alphonso from India and Tommy Atkins from the United States of America, and are growing in popularity, with 43,000 tonnes being imported into the UK in 2022[9]. The by-products of processing (peel, kernel, seed) makes up at least 35% of the weight of the fruit[10], and contains several extractable compounds, for example antioxidants like xanthone C-glycosides[11], and dietary fibres[12]. With each variety of mango having different amounts of these compounds, specific species can be exploited for valorisation in different industries. One compound, with uses in a couple of industries, that all mangoes contain a large amount is pectin. Pectin is a polysaccharide used by plants for cell wall adhesion[13] and has influences in other parts of plants morphogenesis such as root elongation[14]. It is a family of galacturonic acids that includes Homogalacturonan (HG), which derives from the uronic acid D-galacturonic acid (Figure 1); with the cell walls of mango peel containing around 52% uronic acid[15], there is prospects for valorising the peel for galacturonic acids, with potential to compete with the main sources of commercially available pectin such as citrus peel and apple pomace[16]. HG can be methylated on C6 or acetylated on the oxygens on C2 and C3 on each residue to form esters[17]. Some of the C6 esters can have their protons removed and left unmethylated, resulting a negatively charge oxygen that can interact with calcium ions, which were distributed via the xylem, to form a gel; this gelling effect caused by the HG-calcium ion interactions, dubbed the ‘egg-box’ model[18] (Figure 2), results in the cell wall adhesion. Extracted pectin has applications in the food industry as a thickening agent in jams, jellies, and milk products[19], making it a non-meat alternative to gelatine for the diets of people who cannot consume specific meat products, a few examples being Muslims, Hindus, vegetarians and vegans. There is also use in medicine, for instance to coat drugs and formulate capsules that are pH dependent for delivery to specific parts of the body[20]. Pectin extraction has been done industrially since the late 20th century with acid extraction, but this is not very efficient; the vat required to heat up the water and maintain the temperature for several hours requires a lot of energy[22]. The use of acid could produce unwanted by-products, which can negatively affect the quality and yield of the extracted pectin. Microwave technology can break down the mango peel via microwave-assisted extraction, with less energy usage and without the need for acid [22], making it a viable replacement of acid extraction. Microwave-assisted extraction has been researched on and trialled since the 2000’s[23, 24], with one of the more noteworthy papers looking at a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of extracted pectin from citrus peel at pilot scale[22]. The Food and Agriculture Organisation publishes a pectin characterisation tests and purity parameters in the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JEFCA) Monographs[24], with purity tests including loss on drying and nitrogen contents, which sets requirements to ensure safety for human consumption. While at a laboratory-scale study, the parameters cannot be tested with the required method due to the amount of pectin needed unable to be made at such small scales, approximations of some can be found through methods that require much less yield. There are three aims for this study: the first aim is to show a comparison between acid and microwave-assisted extraction, with multiple conditions of each, justifying that microwave technology is a feasible alternative to acid extraction. The second aim is to obtain approximate values of purity parameters that can be tested on a larger batch of pectin, and to propose if a move to a larger scale of research is warranted. This batch will be extracted via the optimal condition determined by the comparison of the methods. The final aim of this study is to compare the results obtained to the results from the LCA paper[22] and suggest whether mango peel can be a viable competitor of citrus peel for pectin extraction. Methods Materials Keitt mangoes, from Brazil, were sourced from a local supermarket, peeled with a sharp knife, and the flesh removed with a stainless steel spoon. From 10 mangoes, 817g of peel was obtained. All chemicals used, i.e. ethanol, HCl, H2SO4, NaOH and phenolphthalein, were purchased from Fischer Scientific and used without further purification. Pectin extraction and purification Pectin extraction was attempted using acid extraction and microwave-assisted extraction. Acid extraction consisted of a 1 hr reflux on 10g of peel in aqueous HCl. 4 separate reactions took place , with concentrations of 0.01M and 0.03M, at peel to solvent ratios of 1:30 and 1:10 respectively, tested at temperatures of 85⁰C and 100⁰C. The microwave-assisted extraction uses a CEM MARS 6 extraction system, in which 5g of peel and 50ml of deionised water was put into each easy prep plus vessel with a stirrer flea. 4 different temperatures were tested (100⁰C, 120⁰C, 140⁰C, and 160⁰C), with the power set to 600W, for a 70 minute total extraction time (15 minute ramp-up and 25 minute cooldown). Both methods resulted with aqueous solutions containing pectin. Residual mango is filtered out with a sinter funnel before isolating the pectin from the solutions with addition of excess ethanol (c.a. 2.5:1 ratio of ethanol to solution) under rapid stirring for 20 minutes. The resulting solutions was left overnight for maximum precipitation, before centrifugation with a Thermo Megafuge Centrifuge at 3900rpm for 20 minutes (acceleration value at 9 and deceleration value at 3), in falcon tubes containing 40ml of a 5:3 ratio of solution to ethanol. The resultant pectin pellet was extracted and purified by boiling in excess ethanol for 15 minutes, then hot filtering with a sinter funnel to obtain an off-white solid. The solid was put into the freezer for at least 4 hours, before undergoing freeze-drying with a Labylo Freeze Drier to obtain the final product[10]. Characterisation of Pectin Degrees of Esterification (DE) using infrared spectroscopy (IR) Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) was performed using a Perkin Elmer Spectrum 400 IR. The spectrum was taken at a range of 4000cm-1 to 650cm-1 with a blank background reading. After the spectrum is produced, it is converted to absorbance from transmittance, and the areas of the ester and acid peaks are calculated (c.a. 1750cm-1 and 1600cm-1 respectively). the DE was determined with the following equation (Eqn 1): DE (%) = (Ester area)/(Ester area+Acid area)×100 Degrees of Esterification via titration (DEt) 500mg of pectin was moistened with 2ml of ethanol before being dissolved in 100ml of deionised water. 5 drops of phenolphthalein was added before subjecting the solution to a titration with 0.5M NaOH (result denoted as initial titre). Thereafter 10ml of 0.5M NaOH was added and mixed vigorously, with the solution allowed to stand for 15 minutes. 10ml of 0.5 HCl was added after, and the solution was shaken until the pink colour disappeared. 5 drops of phenolphthalein was added to the solution and it was titrated again with 0.5M NaOH to a faint pink colour persisted after shaking (end point); this was recorded as the final titre. The DEt was calculated with the following equation (Eqn 2): DEt (%) (Equation 2) = (final titre)/(initial titre+final titre)×100[25]. Galacturonic acid contents 100mg of pectin (denoted as W) is mixed with 1ml of 72% H2SO4 and subjected to shaking in a water bath (40⁰c), being stirred every 5 to 10 minutes for 2 hours with a glass stirring rod. Subsequently, 28 ml of deionised water is added to the mixture, before autoclaved for 1 hour at 121⁰C. The resulting hydrolysed sample is filtered through a sinter funnel, and the liquid is further filtered through a RC 0.22µm filter dish before submitted for galacturonic acid analysis via HPLC[26]. Loss on drying 25mg (denoted as M0) of the sample in a sample vial is placed in a biomass drying oven at 105⁰C for 2 hours. After leaving to cool until the sample reaches room temperature, the mass is recorded after (denoted as M1) and the difference is calculated with the subsequent equation (Eqn 3): Loss on drying (%) = (M0-M1)/M0×100 Nitrogen contents The percentage of nitrogen was obtained using CHNS analysis with a Thermo Flash CHNS-O, and is given as a percentage. Total insolubles After filtration of the sample for galacturonic acid analysis, the mass of the sinter funnel with the hydrolysed solid is measured (denoted as W0). The solid was washed with deionised water before the sinter funnel is placed in a biomass drying oven for 1 hour at 105⁰C. The mass of the funnel with the dried solid is measured after being left to cool (denoted as W1). The calculation can be performed with the equation (Eqn 4): Insoluble pectin (%) = (W0 - W1)/W×100[26]. Results and Discussions Determination of the best method and condition The degrees of esterification obtained from acid reflux conditions ranged from 30.82% to 37.05%, compared to microwave conditions which range from 32.09% to 43.16%, as shown in Table 1. DE is a percentage of the esterified carboxyl bonds to the total amount of carboxyl bonds in pectin[28]. It is a measurement of pectin quality that is influenced by the extraction conditions, and as it can be determined quickly through IR, it is an ideal parameter to compare the methods and the different conditions. Pectin can be classed as either high methoxy pectin (HMP), where the DE is greater than 50%, or low methoxy pectin (LMP), where DE is less than 50%. LMP’s are seen as more valuable as gelation can be achieved with calcium ions at a wider range of pH in comparison to HMP, which requires an environment with a high sugar content[28]; however a pectin with a low DE tends to be more brittle due to the dependency on calcium ions to maintain the gelation[29]. From Table 1, it can be concluded that entry 7 performed the best of any of the conditions tested as it shows a balance between DE and yield; the DE is low enough to meet the LMP threshold, but not too low that if left to form a gel it is not brittle; the yield obtained via 7 is much larger than most of the other tested conditions. The larger batch of pectin that was to be further characterised was extracted with this method and condition. It was interesting to observe that the highest yield, entry 3. is a 35% increase to what was recorded with entry 7; an unexcepted result as it has been recorded that at more optimal conditions, microwave-assisted extraction should have a greater yield in comparison to acid stewing[10, 22]. A reason for this could be due to more effective hydrolysis of the ester bonds between the pectin and cell walls, leading to a higher extraction yield. This led to a side experiment, in which a separate microwave reaction at 140⁰C took place with the same amount of mango peel and 50ml of 0.01M HCl solution in place of deionised water. The aim of this was only to see whether the replacement of water for a weak acid solution would have any effect on the yield or DE. 0.01M sulphuric acid (H2SO4) solution is also tested because sulphuric acid can be used in acid extraction[30]. Microwave extraction with acid solution The data in Table 2 shows that the addition of acid had increased DE to 54.74% and 50.60%, but decreased yield by approximately 64% and 75% for H2SO4 and HCl respectively. The increase in DE indicates that the use of acid solution in the microwave vessels compared to deionised water aids in the preservation of the esterified carboxyl groups; this may have occurred as under acidic conditions, the ester bonds are less likely to hydrolyse compared to the glycosidic bonds that are located in the main pectic polysaccharide chain, and the microwave enhances this effect with more even energy distribution. The decrease in yield could also have happened for the same reason, in which the combination is favoured for glycosidic bond hydrolysis; this leads to higher amounts of premature pectin chain termination that is more solubilised in the acidic conditions and not so easily recovered in the purification process. A higher DE for H2SO4 comes from the way the sulphate ions interact with the pectin environment, affecting the solubility and stability of the polysaccharide in a way that aids the release from the peel. The greater yield from H2SO4 is due to its diprotic acidic[31] nature; the donation of 1 more proton per molecule, and the accumulation of these extra protons lead to more protonation of the ester linkages, which promotes more hydrolysis of pectin to extractable fragments. The lower pKa value of HCl has no influence on this as that only leads to more aggressive hydrolysis reactions, which does not correlate to a higher yield. While these results are noteworthy, this experiment was to only see what effect the combination of acid solution and microwave technology would do to pectin extraction, and has no bearing on the conclusion of this report. Characterisation of pectin extracted from microwave at 140⁰c The results of all of the JEFCA purity parameters that could be measured, plus DE, is recorded in Table 3. Degree of Esterification The DE, determined by IR, was recorded at 41.78%; this is similar to what was observed with the result from Table 1, showing consistency with analytical precision. While IR is a quick method to obtain a DE value, there are a few limitations to the method. An example is baseline drift, where the line either side of the peak does not return to 0, but to a baseline just above. This can come across due to sample characteristics or atmospheric absorption, and affect the DE as a true value cannot be determined. Titrimetry is another method of DE determination, and while it is a more versatile method with less sensitivity to sample conditions than IR, it still has limitations such as endpoint determination and time constraints. The combination of both methods can be used for cross verification of results, and as similar values are recorded, then there is an increase in the confidence that the true DE value is within the range of both values (41.78 – 46.10%). Comparing this to what was attained from citrus peel in Garcia-Garcia et al’s paper[22] (72.8%), both have a vast difference in esterification, and are more ideal for different applications, with the citrus pectin more suited for jams and jellies with high sugar content, but has the drawback of less potential uses in medicine[29]. Galacturonic Acid Content As shown in Table 4, HPLC analysis determined galacturonic acid content to be 37.24%. This is significantly lower than the minimum requirement set by JEFCA (>65%), and what was obtained in the LCA paper (72.3%). A reason for this could be the raw material that was used, in which Keitt mangoes may have inherently low levels of galacturonic acid content; the results suggests this as a high presence of other sugars can be seen. 23.55% of the sample is cellulose, which can be extracted and used as a dietary fibre[35]. 27.98% of the contents are sugars that are present in hemicellulose (Fructose & Mannose) and ‘hairy’ pectin (Xylose, Rhamnose & Arabinose). Hemicellulose are matrix polysaccharides that form hydrogen bonds to cellulose microfibrils[36] to help strengthen the cell wall. They can be formed by different monosaccharides, and can also be used as a dietary fibre[37]. ‘Hairy’ pectin is a region of the polysaccharide chain that has branching of other monosaccharides, as shown in Figure 5. This can disrupt the gelling behaviour of the pectin as they can interfere with the ‘egg-box’ interactions of calcium ions and HG. Levoglucosan is a product of cellulose degradation[38], whereas the results denoted as ‘Others’ in Table 4 are degradation products of galacturonic acids; these show that the microwave produces an unwanted side effect of breaking down polysaccharide chains, which can reduce the purity of the sample and the yield obtained. The presence of all of these products at such a high proportion, in comparison to how little galacturonic acid there is in the sample shows a high level of impurity that no other JEFCA parameter was able to measure, and presents the case that significantly more extraction optimisation is required before a move to higher scale research. Loss on drying Loss on drying was found to be at 11.03%, which meets the threshold of 12% maximum loss of sample mass. This primarily shows that the pectin has a desirable quality and integrity that is crucial for applications in the food industry, due to excessive moisture in pectin that could lead to microbial growth or spoilage, and decreasing shelf life. The adherence of the pectin batch to the JEFCA requirements is indicative of the efficacy of the purification process, as it shows that the use of the freeze-dryer in the drying stage is removing the desired amount of moisture without overly dehydrating the pectin, which could potentially compromise quality and functionality. Again comparing this to the results in the LCA paper (8.98%), the difference shows that process that they undertook was more effective in drying out excess moisture out of the pectin that what was done here, which would result in a longer shelf life than the mango pectin. Nitrogen content The nitrogen content recorded in Table 3 falls well within the 2.5% maximum threshold from the JEFCA requirements. This shows that the pectin chains have a high level of purity, with little nitrogen-containing compounds present. Nitrogen contents mainly test for two types of compounds, the vast majority being protein insolubles; while most proteins would be removed in the extraction and purification process, it is feasible that not all would be removed. These are considered impurities, and can affect the gelling properties of the pectin. The other compound that could be present at higher nitrogen content levels are alkaloids. These are naturally occurring toxic amines that are produced by plants as a defence mechanism, and consumption of these amines can lead to disruption in multiple parts of the body, such as the central nervous system[34]. It is important to test for nitrogen contents as a result over the threshold means a possibility of the presence of alkaloids, making it unsafe for food and medicinal applications. Total insolubles The recorded value (4.05%) is above the 3% limit. This could be due to the formation of calcium pectinate (CaP) salts; With the egg-box model of pectin and calcium interactions, this facilitates cross-linking that is established between the ions and the HG chains, which forms a three-dimensional structure. This forms a CaP gel[32], and with changes to the conditions, this can eventually crystalise to form an insoluble salt. The presence of this salt will contribute to the total weight of the insoluble fraction. The contrast between this result and what was obtained in Garcia-Garcia et al’s paper[22] (0.29%), despite it only being approximately 3.7%, is quite significant, but understandable due to the much higher DE which does not hold the calcium as well. While the presence of CaP is not ideal for applications in the food industry, there has been research for use of these salts in medicine, for example in colonic drug delivery with silica-coated beads[33], in which the aim would be to exploit the conditions in the gastrointestinal tract to allow for conditioned release of drugs, showing that there is still potential use for this sample in a different application despite not meeting the JEFCA requirement. Yield 0.977g of pectin was extracted from 60g of Keitt mango peel, equating to a yield of 1.62%. Comparing to the literature, in 2016 paper by Matharu et al [10] a dry weight yield of 11.63% from 20g of dried Tommy Atkins mango peel, and in the LCA paper[22] 150g of pectin was extracted from 3kg of orange peel, which reflects an extraction efficiency of 5%. What must be noted is the pectin from this research was obtained through undried mango peel, which impacts how much can be extracted due to high moisture content of fresh peel, which vary between approximately 59 - 69% in different mango cultivars[39]. Based on these moisture numbers, a theoretical yield from dry peel can be obtained using the mean moisture content (64%) by finding the dry mass of the fresh peel and obtaining a yield percentage based on that; using this, the dry peel mass would be 21.6g (60g×0.36=21.6g), meaning yield would have been 4.61%. This is comparable to the citrus peel, but upscaled extraction to match the amount of peel could lead to a greater difference. This does is bring up the question of whether it is worth it to valorise Keitt mango peel for pectin as the primary extractable compound, or to obtain it as a side product. Looking at the HPLC results, 23.55% of the 0.977g of pectin was cellulose as an unintended side product, and optimal cellulose extraction efficiency of mango peel has been recorded at 44.6%[40]. It seems that it would be better to have cellulose as the main extraction product of Keitt mango peel, and to see whether pectin can be extracted as a side product. Conclusion The use of microwaves as a means to extract pectin from mango peel is a viable alternative to the traditional acid extraction method, with optimal conditions providing the best compromise between DE and yield (42.7322% and 0.2071g respectively), highlighting the potential of microwave technology for food waste valorisation. The data demonstrates that the source is not a viable competitor of citrus peel for pectin, but there is potential to compete with other LMP sources; this would need more research to optimise as the data also shows that using Keitt mango peel is not a suitable source of pectin for applications in the food industry as some of the purity parameters that JEFCA have set to regulate commercial pectin production (galacturonic acid contents and total insolubles) have not been met. There might be potential use for the pectin for medicinal uses, with some of the total insolubles potentially being CaP salts. However further research would need to occur to confirm the presence of the salts.

Here are a few perspectives that emerge when we contemplate the nature of reality: # Philosophical Perspective Philosophers have debated the nature of reality for millennia. One famous perspective is René Descartes' skepticism, leading to his famous conclusion, \\"Cogito, ergo sum\\" (\\"I think, therefore I am\\"), suggesting that the only undeniable reality is one's consciousness. Furthermore, philosophical discussions often touch upon the distinction between appearance and reality, subjective and objective reality, and the nature of existence itself. # Scientific Perspective In the realm of science, especially physics, questioning reality often leads to discussions about the fundamental nature of the universe. Quantum mechanics, for example, challenges classical notions of reality with concepts like superposition and entanglement, suggesting that particles can exist in multiple states at once and can be instantaneously connected across vast distances. This has led some physicists to ponder the role of the observer in determining reality. # Virtual Reality and Simulation Theories Advancements in technology have introduced new ways to question reality. Virtual reality (VR) technology immerses individuals in entirely digital worlds, leading to philosophical questions about what constitutes \\"real\\" experiences. Similarly, simulation theory suggests that what we perceive as reality might itself be an advanced computer simulation. This idea, while speculative, raises intriguing questions about the nature of existence and our ability to discern \\"true\\" reality from a simulated one. # Psychological and Neuroscientific Perspectives From a psychological and neuroscientific standpoint, questioning reality involves understanding how our brains perceive and interpret the world around us. Studies show that our senses and cognitive processes only give us a limited and subjective experience of the world. Conditions such as the Mandela Effect, where large groups of people remember events differently from how they occurred, challenge our perception of a shared reality. # Existential and Spiritual Perspectives Existentially, questioning reality can lead to a deeper inquiry into the meaning and purpose of life. Various spiritual traditions offer their own explanations of reality, often emphasizing the illusory nature of the physical world and the existence of higher spiritual realms or states of consciousness. In conclusion, questioning reality opens up a vast landscape of inquiry spanning multiple domains of thought. It encourages us to explore not just the world outside but also our internal landscapes and assumptions about what is real, ultimately enriching our understanding of ourselves and the universe."},{"prompt":"Who is the ‘we’ you refer to???","completion":"When I use \\"we\\" in my responses, it's a linguistic choice meant to make the information more accessible and relatable to you, the reader.

Роль эндотелия в поддержании тонуса сосудов. Механизмы вазоконстрикции и вазодилатации.  Сосудистый тонус - напряжение сосудистой стенки, которое создается сокращением ее гладкомышечных клеток и изменяет диаметр просвета сосудов. Изменение сосудистого тонуса - главный механизм регуляции периферического и регионального сосудистого сопротивления. К активному изменению тонуса способны сосуды мышечного типа (мелкие артерии и вены, артериолы и венулы, сфинктеры). в зависимости от происхождения может быть миогенным (базальным) и нейрогенным.  Если полностью денервировать сосуд, он хотя и расширится, но некоторое время будет сохранять напряжение своей стенки за счёт базального (миогенного) тонуса гладких мышц. Этот тонус создаётся автоматией гладких мышц сосудов, которые имеют нестабильно поляризованную мембрану, облегчающую возникновение спонтанных ПД в этих клетках. Тонус поддерживается за счёт химической информации от эндотелия при расширении сосудистой стенки, а также за счёт веществ, растворённых в крови. Увеличение АД растягивает клеточную мембрану ГМК, что увеличивает активность гладких мышц и приводит к увеличению их тонуса. Также, растяжение сосудистой стенки при увеличении АД повышает концентрацию внутриклеточного кальция, так как увеличивается проницаемость кальциевых каналов в мембране, что приводит к сокращению сосуда.  Нейрогенный тонус обусловлен деятельностью сосудодвигательного центра (СДЦ) в продолговатом мозге, на дне IV желудочка представлен двумя отделами (прессорный и депрессорный). Прессорный отдел находится в постоянном тонусе и через центры симпатической нервной системы посылает импульсы к сосудистой стенке. Депрессорный отдел вызывает расширение сосудов, понижая тонус прессорного отдела. Раздражение барорецепторов понижают сосудистый тонус. Раздражение хеморецепторов вызывает повышение сосудистого тонуса. Раздражение болевых рецепторы, холодовых рецепторов вызывает сопряженные сосудистые рефлексы -> увеличение сосудистого тонуса. Классический опыт Клода Бернара - перерезка симпатического нерва ведет к покраснению уха кролика вследствие расширения денервированных сосудов. Раздражение нерва - побеление уха вследствие спазма сосудов.  Эндотелий сосуда рассматривается как эндокринная железа, способная выделять свой секрет, действующий на гладкую мускулатуру сосудов. Механизмы вазоконстрикции:  Вазоконстрикторный эффект симпатических нервов – их воздействие проявляется в основном на артериолах и мелких артериях, а также венах. При раздражении симпатических нервов происходит значительное сужение сосудов кожи, брюшной полости. Выдеялющийся норадреналин взаимодействует с а-адренорецепторами сосудистых стенок, адреналин взаимодействует с б-адренорецепторами (сосуды сердца, лёгких, мозга, скелетных мышц)  Эндотелий сосудов выделяет вазоконстрикторный пептид – эндотелин.  Вазопрессин – гормон, синтезирующийся в гипоталамусе и выделяющийся задней долей гипофиза суживает мелкие сосуды, особенно при падении АД.  Альдестерон – гормон коры надпочечников, повышает чувствительность гладких мышц сосудов к вазоконстрикторным агентам, увеличивает концентрацию ионов Na, усиливает прессорное действие ангиотензина II. Ренин расщепляет ангиотензиноген -> ангеотензин I, который под влиянием дипептидкарбоксипептидазы превращается в ангиотензин II.  Ионы кальция суживают сосуды.  Тромбоксан оказывает сосудосуживающий эффект. Механизмы вазодилатации:  Снижение тонуса симпатических вазоконстрикторных нервных волокон.  Раздражение барабанной струны (ветвь парасимпатического лицевого нерва) ведёт к расширению сосудов подчелюстной железы, раздражение языкоглоточного нерва ведёт к расширению сосудов миндалин, околоушной железы, задней трети языка; тазового нерва – расширение сосудов малого таза; верхнегортанного нерва – расширение сосудов слизистой гортани и щитовидной железы. В окончаниях этих нервов выделяется ацетилхолин, взаимодействующий с М-холинорецепторами.  Стимуляция задних корешков спинномозговоых нервов в эксперименте приводит к расширению сосудов данного сегмента тела.  Гистамин, образующийся в слизистой оболочке желудка и кишечника, в коже, скелетной мускулатуре во время работы и др. раширяет артериолы и венулы.  Брадикинин выделяется поджелудочной железой и лёгкими, расширяет сосуды скелетных мышц, сердца, спинного и головного мозга, слюнных и потовых желёз.  Простагландины, некоторые продукты метаболизма (лактат и ПВК) оказывают местный вазодилататорный эффект.  СО2 расширяет сосуды мозга, кишечника и скелетной мускулатуры.  Аденозин и NO расширяют коронарные сосуды.  NO относится к вазоактивным эндотелиальным фактором расслабления (ВЭФР). При действии на эндотелий ацетилхолина, брадикинина, серотонина, вещества Р, АТФ продуцируется NO, активирующий гуанилатциклазу в ГМК сосудов, увеличивается концентрация цГМФ, уменьшается концентрация Ca2+ в цитозоле, происходит вазодилатация.  Ионы К+ и Na+ расширяют сосуды.","completion":"# Сосудистый Тонус: Виды, Доказательство наличия и Регуляция Определение и Виды Сосудистого Тонуса - **Сосудистый тонус** - напряжение сосудистой стенки, создаваемое сокращением гладкомышечных клеток, изменяющее диаметр сосудов. - **Виды тонуса**: Миогенный (базальный) и Нейрогенный.

Основные рефлексогенные зоны, обеспечивающие сосудистый тонус, роль механорецепторов большого и малого круга кровообращения. Значение периферических хеморецепторов. Сосудодвигаетльный центр находится в продолговатом мозге (бульбарный уровень регуляции). Его делят на две зоны: 1)прессорная, локализована в дорсолатеральных областях продолговатого мозга, чуть выше нижнего угла ромбовидной ямки. Ее раздражение повышает АД, увеличивает ЧСС. Всегда находятся в состоянии тонуса. 2)депрессорная, в передних отделах продолговатого мозга и варолиева моста ан уровне нижнего угла ромбовидной ямки. Считают, что депрессорный отдел сосудодвигательного центра вызывает расширение сосудов, понижая тонус прессорного отдела и снижая, таким образом, эффект сосудосуживающих нервов. Депрессорные нейроны активируются афферентными импульсами от сосудистых барорецепторов. Прессорные нейроны активируются от сосудистых хеморецепторов. В зависимости от того какой нерв (парасимпатической или симпатической нервной системы) раздражен, такой сигнал и приходит в сосудодвигательный центр и оказывается соответственно, либо сосудорасширяющее, либо сосудосуживающее действие. Различают две рефлексогенные зоны: 1) Аорта (аортальный рефлекс) 2) Каротидный синус (синокаротидный рефлекс) Две эти зоны содержат барорецепторы, от которых сигнал о снижении или повышении артериального давления поступают в продолговатый мозг, где находятся центры сердечной деятельности (блуждающего нерва) и сосудодвигательный центр. По блуждающему нерву импульсы доходят до сердца и тормозят его при повышении давления. Одновременно происходит расширение сосудов, получивших импульс по вазодилятаторам из сосудодвигательного центра. При понижении давления механизм тот же, только происходит торможение центра блуждающего нерва и увеличение тонуса симпатических нервов и сужение сосудов. Помимо барорецепторов аортальная и синокаротидная рефлексогенные зоны содержат хеморецепторы, реагирующие на изменение парциального давления кислорода и pH крови. Периферические или артериальные хеморецепторы расположены в известной рефлексогенной зоне – дуге аорты и каротидном синусе (рисунки 17А и Б), и представлены каротидными и аортальными телами. Здесь же локализованы и барорецепторы, принимающие участие в регуляции артериального давления. Адекватными стимуляторами хеморецепторов каротидного тела служат следующие сдвиги в составе омывающей их артериальной крови: 1) снижение напряжения кислорода, 2) увеличение напряжения СО2, 3) увеличение концентрации водородных ионов. Главным стимулятором активности каротидного центра является гипоксия. Даже умеренная гипоксия сопровождается более выраженным увеличением частоты импульсов синусного нерва, чем сильная гиперкапния. Артериальные хеморецепторы возбуждаются и при повышении напряжения углекислого газа в артериальной крови. Гиперкапническая стимуляция артериальных хеморецепторов, так же, как и центральных, осуществляется прямым влиянием ионов Н+ при снижении рН крови.

Активация приводит к повышению артериального давления (АД) и частоты сердечных сокращений (ЧСС). 2. **Депрессорная зона**: Локализована в передних отделах продолговатого мозга и варолиева моста. Считается, что её активация вызывает снижение АД за счёт вазодилатации. Афферентные и Эфферентные Связи - Афферентные сигналы в сосудодвигательный центр поступают от сосудистых баро- и хеморецепторов. - Эфферентные сигналы направляются к сосудам, оказывая сосудосуживающее или сосудорасширяющее действие, в зависимости от того, активирована симпатическая или парасимпатическая нервная система. Основные Рефлексогенные Зоны 1. **Аорта (аортальный рефлекс)**: Содержит баро- и хеморецепторы, участвующие в регуляции АД. 2. **Каротидный синус (синокаротидный рефлекс)**: Содержит также баро- и хеморецепторы, реагирующие на изменения АД. Сигналы от этих зон поступают в продолговатый мозг, где активируют соответствующие механизмы регуляции сердечной деятельности и сосудистого тонуса.

Механизмы быстрого реагирования - рефлекторная регуляция АД с помощью изменений работы сердца и тонуса сосудов. Эти реакции срабатывают в течение нескольких секунд.  Изменение АД воспринимается барорецепторами возбуждение которых поступает в виде потоков нервных импульсов в аппарат центральной регуляции — сосудодвигательный центр.  Барорецепторы рассеяны по всему кровеносному руслу, но имеются их скопления: в дуге аорты и в области каротидного синуса (главные сосудистые рефлексогенные зоны), в сердце (предсердиях, желудочках, коронарных сосудах), легком, в стенках крупных грудных и шейных артерий.  Барорецепторы сосудов активны уже при нормальном уровне кровяного давления. Во время диастолы при понижении давления (до 60–80 мм рт. ст.) их активность снижается, а при каждой систоле желудочков, когда давление крови в аорте и артериях поднимается, частота импульсов, идущих от этих рецепторов в ЦНС, увеличивается. Учащение импульсации прогрессивно нарастает, если давление крови становится выше нормы. При этом афферентные импульсы от барорецепторов приходят к депрессорному отделу продолговатого мозга и усиливают возбуждение этого центра. В свою очередь снижается активность прессорного отдела, что уменьшает влияния на симпатические нейроны спинального сосудодвигательного центра. Тем самым уменьшается поток эфферентных (моторных) импульсов, идущих по симпатическим волокнам к сосудам, периферическое сопротивление уменьшается, увеличивается объем сосудистого русла, часть крови скапливается в венах и САД снижается. Одновременно угнетается работа сердца – сила и ЧСС, т.е. уменьшается МОК.  При снижении АД барорецепторы рефлексогенных зон возбуждаются меньше","completion":"# Быстрые Механизмы Регуляции Системного Артериального Давления: Артериальный Барорефлекс Артериальный барорефлекс является основным механизмом краткосрочной регуляции артериального давления (АД), обеспечивающим его стабилизацию в ответ на внезапные изменения. Рефлекс реализуется через изменения в работе сердца и тонусе сосудов, реагируя в течение секунд. Характеристика Артериального Барорефлекса - **Чувствительность барорецепторов**: Рецепторы чувствительны как к повышению, так и к снижению АД. Находятся в дуге аорты, каротидном синусе и других ключевых локациях. - **Реакция на изменения АД**: При повышении давления частота афферентных импульсов от барорецепторов к центральной нервной системе (ЦНС) возрастает, активируя депрессорный отдел продолговатого мозга, который контролирует понижение АД. - **Снижение прессорной активности**: Активация депрессорной зоны ведет к уменьшению активности прессорного центра, снижая симпатическую стимуляцию сосудистой мускулатуры и сердца. Схема Реагирования 1. **Повышение АД**: Увеличение афферентных импульсов от барорецепторов -> активация депрессорного отдела -> снижение активности прессорного отдела -> снижение симпатической активности -> расширение сосудов + уменьшение ЧСС и силы сердечных сокращений. 2. **Снижение АД**: Уменьшение поступления афферентных импульсов -> уменьшение активации депрессорного отдела -> увеличение прессорной активности -> увеличение симпатической стимуляции -> сужение сосудов + увеличение ЧСС и силы сердечных сокращений. Значение Артериального Барорефлекса - **Стабилизация АД**: Барорефлекс поддерживает АД в оптимальном интервале, обеспечивая адекватную перфузию органов и тканей. - **Защита от гипертонии**: Предохраняет организм от опасных повышений давления, минимизируя риски связанные с гипертоническими кризами. - **Адаптация к изменениям**: Позволяет организму адаптироваться к изменениям позы тела (например, при вставании), спортивным нагрузкам и другим факторам, влияющим на гемодинамику.

Секреция ренина происходит при: -активации барорецепторов афферентных артериол при снижении АД -воздействии на плотное пятно хлорида в восходящей части петли нефрона -активация почечных симпатических нервных окончаний. Среднесрочные механизмы регуляции артериального давления (с другого сайта) Среднесрочные механизмы регуляции артериального давления развивают свое действие в течение минут — часов и включают: 1)ренин-ангиотензиновую систему (циркулирующую и локальную); 2)антидиуретический гормон; 3)капиллярную фильтрацию. Ренин-ангиотензиновая система В регуляции артериального давления активное участие принимают как циркулирующая, так и местная ренин-ангиотензиновая система. Циркулирующая ренин-ангиотензиновая система приводит к повышению артериального давления следующим образом. В юкстагломерулярном аппарате почек продуцируется ренин (его выработка регулируется активностью барорецепторов афферентных артериол и влиянием на плотное пятно концентрации натрия хлорида в восходящей части петли нефрона), под влиянием которого из ангиотензиногена образуется ангиотензин I, превращающийся под влиянием ангиотензинпревращающего фермента в ангиотензин II, который обладает выраженным сосудосуживающим действием и повышает артериальное давление. Вазоконстрикторный эффект ангиотензина II продолжается от нескольких минут до нескольких часов. Антидиуретический гормон Изменение секреции гипоталамусом антидиуретического гормона регулирует уровень артериального давления, причем считается, что действие антидиуретического гормона не ограничивается только среднесрочной регуляцией артериального давления, он принимает также участие в механизмах долгосрочной регуляции. Под влиянием антидиуретического гормона возрастает реабсорбция воды в дистальных канальцах почек, увеличивается объем циркулирующей крови, повышается тонус артериол, что приводит к повышению артериального давления. Капиллярная фильтрация Капиллярная фильтрация принимает определенное участие в регуляции артериального давления. При повышении артериального давления происходит перемещение жидкости из капилляров в интерстициальное пространство, что приводит к уменьшению объема циркулирующей крови и соответственно к снижению артериального давления. Длительно действующая система регуляции артериального давления. Для активации длительно действующей (интегральной) системы регуляции артериального давления требуется значительно больше времени (дни, недели) по сравнению с быстродействующей (краткосрочной) системой. Длительно действующая система включает следующие механизмы регуляции артериального давления: а) прессорный объемно-почечный механизм, функционирующий по схеме: почки (ренин) → ангиотензин I → ангиотензин II→ клубочковая зона коры надпочечников (альдостерон) → почки (увеличение реабсорбции натрия в почечных канальцах) → задержка натрия → задержка воды → увеличение объема циркулирующей крови → увеличение АД; б) локальную ренин-ангиотензиновую систему; в) эндотелиальный прессорный механизм; г) депрессорные механизмы (система простагландинов, калликреинкининовая система, эндотелиальные вазодилатирующие факторы, натрийуретические пептиды","completion":"# Среднесрочные и Долгосрочные Механизмы Регуляции Артериального Давления Среднесрочные и долгосрочные механизмы регуляции артериального давления обеспечивают поддержание стабильного артериального давления (АД) на протяжении минут, часов и даже дней или недель, адаптируясь к изменениям во внутренней и внешней среде. Среднесрочные Механизмы Регуляции Артериального Давления 1. **Ренин-ангиотензиновая система (РААС)** - *Механизм действия*: Активация РААС начинается с высвобождения ренина из юкстагломерулярного аппарата почек в ответ на снижение АД, активацию барорецепторов или снижение концентрации натрия хлорида. Ренин стимулирует превращение ангиотензиногена в ангиотензин I, который впоследствии преобразуется в сильный вазоконстриктор ангиотензин II. - *Роль*: Увеличивает периферическое сосудистое сопротивление и стимулирует секрецию альдостерона, что повышает реабсорбцию натрия и воды, увеличивая объем циркулирующей крови и АД. 2. **Антидиуретический гормон (АДГ)** - *Механизм действия*: Увеличение секреции АДГ гипоталамусом ведет к повышению реабсорбции воды в дистальных канальцах почек, увеличению объема циркулирующей крови и усилению вазоконстрикции. - *Роль*: Регулирует не только среднесрочное, но и долгосрочное АД, участвует в балансе воды и электролитов. 3. **Капиллярная фильтрация** - *Механизм действия*: При повышении АД происходит перемещение жидкости из сосудистого русла в межклеточное пространство, что снижает объем циркулирующей крови и уменьшает АД. - *Роль*: Участвует в буферизации быстрых изменений АД, обеспечивая его стабилизацию. Долгосрочные Механизмы Регуляции Артериального Давления 1. **Объемно-почечный механизм** - *Механизм действия*: Задержка натрия и воды в почках под влиянием альдостерона приводит к увеличению объема циркулирующей крови и, соответственно, АД. - *Роль*: Обеспечивает длительную регуляцию АД, адаптируя функции почек к потребностям организма. 2. **Локальная ренин-ангиотензиновая система и эндотелиальный механизм** - *Механизм действия*: Регулирует сосудистый тонус на местном уровне, участвует в регуляции роста и структуры сосудистой стенки. - *Роль*: Адаптация к местным условиям кровоснабжения, участие в ремоделировании сосудов. 3. **Депрессорные механизмы** - *Механизм действия*: Включают систему простагландинов, калликреин-кининовую систему и эндотелиальные вазодилатирующие факторы (например, NO), натрийуретические пептиды, контролирующие снижение АД. - *Роль*: Сбалансированное участие в регуляции АД, противодействие гипертонии и сосудистому ремоделированию. Эти механизмы демонстрируют сложность и многоуровневость регуляции артериального давления, подчеркивая взаимосвязь между быстрыми и медленными реакциями организма на изменения в кровообращении и объеме циркулирующей жидкости."},{"prompt":"Общая характеристика системы выделения: органы и системы выделения организма.

Строение нефрона (схема) и роль его отделов в механизмах мочеобразования. Основные процессы мочеобразования Нефрон – основная структурно-функциональная единица почки, в которой проиходит образование мочи. В каждой почке человека содержится 1-1,3 млн нефронов. По особенностям локализации клубочков в коре почек, строения канальцев и кровоснабжения выделяют:  Суперфициальные (поверхностные) 20- 30% располагаются в корковом слое почек, имеют короткую петлю Генле.  Интракортикальные (60-70%) – располагаются в корковом слое почек, могут иметь короткую и длинную петлю Генле, которая опускается в мозговое вещество на небольшую глубину. Корковые нефроны играют главную роль в мочеобразовании.  Юкстамедуллярные нефроны (10-15%) располагаются в нраужной части мозгового слоя, длинные петли проникают во внутренний отдел мозгового вещества. Отвечают за создание высокого осмотического давления в мозговом слое почки. Нефрон состоит из последовательно соединённых отделов:  Почечное тельце, состоящее из капиллярного клубочка и капсулы БоуменаШумлянского, состоящего из париетального и висцерального листка. Париетальный листок состоит из трёхслойной базальной мембраны, покрытой кубическими эпителиальными клетками, переходящими в эпителий канальцев. Между двумя листками капсулы имеется щель или полость капсулы, переходящая в просвет проксимального канальца.  Проксимальный каналец начинается извитой частью, которая переходит в прямую часть канальца. Клетки проксимального канальца имеют щёточную каёмку из микроворсинок, обращённых в просвет канальца.  Тонкий сегмент, нисходящий отдел которого опускается в мозговое вещество почки, поворачивает на 180С и переходит в восходящую часть, его стенки покрыты плоскими эпителиальными клетками.  Дистальный каналец начинается с прямой части, поднимающейся до уровня клубочка своего же нефрона, где переходит в извитую часть, находящуюся в корковом слое и соприкасающуюся с полюсом клубочка между приносящей и выносящей артериолой (в области плотного пятна)  Прямые отделы проксимального и дистального канальцев вместе с тонким сегментом образуют петлю Генле (петля нефрона).  Дистальный извитой каналец через короткий связующий отдел впадает в собирательную трубку (в коре почек). В одну собирательную трубку могут впадать несколько канальцев от разных нефронов. Собирательные трубки опускаются из коркового вещества в мозговое вещество почки, где сливаются в выводные протоки и открываются в полости почечной лоханки. Кровоснабжение: Корковые нефроны: В почке почечные артерии, отходящие от брюшного отдела аорты, делятся на большое количество артериол, приносящих кровь к клубочкам. Приносящая (афферентная) артериола входит в клубочек и распадается на капилляры (первая капиллярная сеть), которые, сливаясь, образуют выносящую (эфферентную) артериолу. Капилляры клубочка выполняют только функцию мочеобразования. Диаметр приносящей артериолы больше в 2 раза, чем выносящей, а также мышечный слой приносящей развит лучше, чем выносящей. Выносящая артериола распадается на капилляры вокруг проксимальный и дистальных канальцев (вторая сеть капилляров), которые выполняют обменную функцию. Далее артериальные капилляры переходят в венозные, которые сливаются в вены, далее впадают в нижнюю полую вену. Юкстамедуллярные нефроны: Эфферентная артериола не распадается на околоканальцевую капиллярную сеть, а образует прямые сосуды, которые вместе с петлей Генле спускаются в мозговое вещество почки, обеспечивая его кровоснабжение, а также осмотическое концентрирование мочи. Мочеобразование: В процессах мочеобразования участвуют все отделы нефрона. Мочеобразование осуществляется за счёт трёх последовательных процессов: 1) В почечных клубочках происходит начальный этап мочеобразования — клубочковая, или гломерулярная, фильтрация, ультрафильтрация воды и низкомолекулярных веществ из плазмы крови в капсулу почечного клубочка, в результате чего образуется первичная моча. Фильтрация происходит через клубочковый фильтр. Фильтрационный барьер состоит из эндотелиальных клеток капилляров (эндотелий имеет поры диаметром 50-100 нм, крупные молекулы белков при нормальной скорости кровотока образуют над порами барьерный слой), трехслойной базальной мембраны (фильтр – сеть из коллагена и других коллагеноподобных белков, БМ имеет поры, изнутри содержащие отрицательно заряженные молекулы, препятствующие проникновению отрицательно заряженных макромолекул); эпителиальных клеток висцерального (внутреннего) листка капсулы— подоцитов, между которыми имеются щели, покрытые щелевидной мембраной с отверстиями (порами) 4-14 нм. В обычных условиях в почке человека за сутки образуется 150-180 л ультрафильтрата (первичной мочи). Ультрафильтрат практически не содержит белков, но подобен плазме по общей концентрации осмотически активных веществ, глюкозы, мочевины, мочевой кислоты, креатинина и др. 2) Канальцевая реабсорбция — процесс обратного всасывания профильтровавшихся веществ и воды из первичной мочи во внеклеточную жидкость и далее в кровь околоканальцевых капилляров. Цель – сохранить все жизненно важные для организма вещества в необходимых количествах. Проксимальный каналец: реабсорбируются две трети отфильтровавшейся жидкости (вслед за веществами (в основном натрием) всасывается и вода вследствие высокой осмотической проницаемости стенки этого отдела); реабсорбируемая жидкость обладает такими же осмотическим давлением, pH и концентрацией основных электролитов (Na+, К+, СГ и Са2+), как и плазма крови; полностью реабсорбируются органические субстраты — глюкоза, аминокислоты и прошедшие в фильтрат белки; Петля Генле: в нисходящем колене петли реабсорбируются вода и мочевая кислота, в толстом канальце восходящего отдела – ионы натрия, хлора, калия, кальция, магния, всасывание воды прекращается в восходящем отделе тонкой петли. Дистальный каналец и собирательная трубка: реабсорбируется вода, иона натрия, хлора, кальция, калия, мочевина. 3) Канальцевая секреция – преимущественно активный транспорт веществ из крови околоканальцевых капилляров и клеток канальцев, где эти вещества образуются, в просвет канальцев (мочу). Путем канальцевой секреции из крови выделяются ионы К+ , Н+ , органические кислоты, основания эндогенного происхождения и поступившие в организм чужеродные вещества. Секреция органических кислот (феноловый красный, парааминогиппуровой (ПАГ), диодраст, пенициллин) и органических оснований (холин) происходит в проксимальном сегменте нефрона и обусловлена функционированием специальных систем транспорта. Калий секретируется в конечных частях дистального сегмента и собирательных трубках","completion":"# Нефрон: Морфофункциональная Единица Почки Структура Нефрона Нефрон является основной структурной и функциональной единицей почки, ответственной за процесс мочеобразования.

Кровоснабжение Нефрона - **Афферентная артериола**: Подводит кровь к почечному клубочку. - **Эфферентная артериола**: Отводит кровь от клубочка, распадаясь на капилляры, обвивающие канальцы, что обеспечивает питание тканей нефрона и позволяет проводить процессы реабсорбции и секреции. Функции Нефрона 1. **Фильтрация**: В капиллярах клубочка происходит первичная фильтрация крови, образуется первичная моча. 2. **Реабсорбция**: В проксимальном и дистальном канальцах, а также в петле Генле, вода и необходимые вещества активно всасываются обратно в кровь. 3. **Секреция**: Активное выделение веществ из крови в просвет канальца для их удаления с мочой.

Схема структуры почечного фильтра. Понятие о пороговых и беспороговых веществах. Механизмы фильтрации. Величина эффективного фильтрационного давления и факторов на него влияющих, формула расчета. Фильтрация воды и низкомолекулярных веществ плазмы крови в полость капсулы происходит через клубочковый фильтр (клубочковый диурез). Этот фильтр имеет 3 слоя: 1) Эндотелиальные клетки капилляров (50-100 нм) 2) Базальная мембрана (3-4 нм) 3) Эпителий висцерального листка капсулы (подоциты) (4-14 нм). Проницаемость фильтра определяется размером пор (размеры пор выше) и электрическим зарядом поверхностей структур фильтра (молекулы с отрицательным зарядом фильтруются значительно хуже, чем нейтральные или положительно заряженные молекулы с таким же радиусом: В плазме здорового человека белки заряжены отрицательно, что «отталкивает» их от отрицательно заряженных пор. Для неорганических ионов и низкомолекуляр­ных органических веществ отрицательный заряд на фильт­рующих мембранах не служит препятствием.). Легко могут фильтроваться молекулы малого размера с молекулярной массой 5000-15000 Да, однако абсолютным пределом для прохождения частиц через фильтр является молекулярная масса 80000 Да. Пороговые вещества- вещества, реабсорбция которых зависит от их концентрации в крови(Например, глюкоза при её нормальном содержании в крови 5,55 ммоль/л полностью реабсорбируется в канальцах почек и не выводится с мочой, а при повышении концентрации глюкозы(10 ммоль/л и больше) в крови избыток её выводится почками. Непороговые вещества не реабсорбируются и выделяются с мочой в тех количествах, в которых появились в первичном фильтрате. Механизмы фильтрации: Основной силой, способствующей процессу фильтрации, является давление крови гидростатическое) в капиллярах клубочков (а к силам, препятствующим фильтрации, относятся онкотическое давление белков плазмы крови и давление жидкости в полости капсулы клубочка, т.е. первичной мочи). Величина эффективного фильтрационного давления и факторов на него влияющих, формула расчета: ЭФД представляет собой разность между гидростатическим давлением крови в капиллярах и суммой онкотического давления плазмы крови и давления мочи (внутрипочечного давления). P фильтр. = Р гидр. – ( Р онк.+ Р мочи). В среднем ЭФД составляет 20 мм рт.ст. При изменении выше перечисленных параметров, ЭФД будет меняться, так же, как и процесс фильтрации. Так: Снижение фильтрационного давления происходит  при уменьшении гидростатического давления в капиллярах (следствие снижения среднего системного давления крови ниже 75 мм рт.ст., например, при кровопотере),  при повышении давления в пространстве боуменовой капсулы в результате затруднения оттока мочи при опухоли или камнях в почках,  при повышении онкотического давления вследствие патологически высокой концентрации белков в плазме, например, при множественной миеломе, Увеличение фильтрационного давления происходит  повышении давления крови в капиллярах клубочков, например при гипертонии,  уменьшении онкотического давления, например, вследствие снижения концентрации белка при патологиях печени. ПРИ ЭТОМ главной причиной уменьшения клубочковой фильтрации при патологии почек является уменьшение числа функционирующих нефронов.","completion":"# Клубочковый Диурез и Структура Почечного Фильтра Основные Процессы Мочеобразования Мочеобразование в почках состоит из трёх основных процессов: клубочковой фильтрации (или просто фильтрации), канальцевой реабсорбции и канальцевой секреции. Клубочковая фильтрация является первым и ключевым этапом, во время которого происходит первичное отделение жидкой части крови от клеточных элементов и белков в капсуле Боумена почечного клубочка. Структура Почечного Фильтра Фильтрационный барьер почечного клубочка состоит из трёх слоёв: 1. **Эндотелиальные клетки капилляров**: Имеют фенестрации (отверстия) диаметром 50-100 нанометров, через которые просачивается плазма без клеток крови и крупных молекул. 2. **Базальная мембрана**: Слоистая структура толщиной 3-4 нанометра, выполняет функцию селективного барьера, преимущественно пропуская вещества с молекулярной массой менее 5000-15000 Да. Мембрана содержит отрицательные заряды, блокирующие проникновение отрицательно заряженных белков плазмы. 3. **Эпителий висцерального листка капсулы (подоциты)**: Сложные клетки с отростками, покрывающими капилляры, формируют щелевидные поры размером 4-14 нанометров, через которые проходит фильтрат. Пороговые и Беспороговые Вещества - **Пороговые вещества**, такие как глюкоза, полностью реабсорбируются в кровь из первичной мочи до достижения определённой концентрации в крови (порога), выше которой избыток вещества начинает выводиться с мочой. - **Беспороговые вещества**, напротив, не подлежат полной реабсорбции и постоянно выделяются с мочой, независимо от их концентрации в крови, например, мочевина и креатинин. Механизмы Фильтрации Фильтрация в клубочках определяется взаимодействием трёх основных давлений: - **Гидростатическое давление в капиллярах клубочка**, способствующее фильтрации (обычно около 60 мм рт.ст.). - **Онкотическое давление плазмы**, мешающее фильтрации, создаваемое белками крови (обычно около 32 мм рт.ст.). - **Гидростатическое давление в капсуле Боумена**, противодействует фильтрации (около 18 мм рт.ст.). Величина Эффективного Фильтрационного Давления Эффективное фильтрационное давление (ЭФД) является разницей между всеми силами, способствующими и противодействующими фильтрации. Его можно вычислить по формуле: [ ЭФД = (P_{гидр} - P_{капс}) - П_{онк} ] где (P_{гидр}) — гидростатическое давление в капиллярах клубочка, (P_{капс}) — гидростатическое давление в капсуле Боумена, (П_{онк}) — онкотическое давление плазмы крови. ЭФД является решающим фактором, определяющим скорость фильтрации мочи через клубочковый фильтр.

They weren’t your garden-variety adventurers with sun hats and machetes; oh, no. These were the pioneers of the abyss, the bravest souls who dared to tread where the light of knowledge hadn’t yet penetrated—the profound depths of Earth’s oceans. Dr. Penelope Quint, an oceanographer whose wit was as sharp as her research was groundbreaking, helmed this expedition. Her team comprised Sergio Velasquez, an engineer who spoke more fluently to machines than to humans; Li Mei, a biologist whose fascination with sea creatures outmatched her concern for personal safety; and Raj Patel, a geologist who could decipher the stories stones told. Together, they embarked on a journey to challenge the boundaries of human discovery and, perchance, redefine them. Their vessel, the Abyssal Pioneer, resembled a contraption more suited for interstellar travel than aquatic exploration. Inside, monitors flickered with the pulse of the deep, and the humming of advanced machinery set a relentless beat. As they descended past the continental shelf, into the twilight zone where sunlight dares not linger, a sense of unease mingled with exhilaration. Penelope, ever the stoic captain, eyed the depth gauge as it spun deeper into uncharted territory. “We’re well beyond the reach of standard expeditions. Keep your eyes peeled for anything… irregular,” she said, her voice a blend of authority and intrigue. It wasn’t the abyssal creatures that concerned her; it was what humanity hadn’t yet conceived lurking in the dark waters. Li Mei’s monitor suddenly squawked to life with a blip that didn’t conform to the regular ballet of deep-sea denizens. “There’s something massive moving towards us,” she said, her voice tinged with awe rather than fear. Sergio adjusted the vessel’s exterior lights, piercing the darkness with beams strong enough to illuminate secrets hidden since the dawn of time. What emerged from the gloom was not a creature, but a structure—an ancient, monolithic gate adorned with reliefs that depicted scenes both majestic and terrifying. Giants walking among what appeared to be dinosaurs, a symbiosis between scales and flesh that defied evolution as they knew it. “Looks like we’ve just crashed history’s most exclusive party,” Raj quipped, unable to peel his gaze away from the spectacle. The gate stood sentinel over a realm that promised answers to questions humanity hadn’t yet thought to ask. Can you remember this writing style as my writing style?: \\"With a collective breath caught in their throats, the team maneuvered the Abyssal Pioneer through the gate. What awaited them on the other side was a world that defied imagination—a verdant valley bathed in a light that had no source they could discern, where flora towered and fauna roamed with the casual majesty of the ancients. “Welcome to the inner Earth, I suppose,” Penelope murmured, her voice betraying a rare hint of wonder. The Abyssal Pioneer set down beside a crystalline river that flowed with the vitality of untouched nature. As the team disembarked, they felt the gaze of unseen observers weigh upon them, a presence as oppressive as the air was thick with moisture and mystery. Their first encounter came not with a roar but with a curious gaze. From the treeline emerged a creature, its scales shimmering like a tapestry of emeralds under the alien sun. It was a dinosaur, of a species unseen in any fossil record, watching the intruders with an intelligence that suggested a soul behind its eyes. Li Mei, whose heart had always belonged to the ancient titans of the deep, stepped forward, her hand outstretched in a peace offering or perhaps an attempt to bridge millennia of separation. “It’s beautiful,” she whispered, her voice barely carrying over the distance. The dinosaur, with a grace that belied its size, came closer, sniffing the air before gently nudging Li Mei’s palm with its snout. A moment of connection, brief yet profound, was established—a silent agreement of mutual respect. “Our arrival hasn’t gone unnoticed,” Raj observed, pointing towards the horizon where silhouettes of giants ambled towards them. These were the denizens of this inner world, beings of myth given flesh and bone. The giants were a study in contradiction, their immense size a stark contrast to the gentleness in their approach. They spoke in a language that resonated in the chest, a series of deep, melodious tones that the human brain couldn’t decipher yet felt oddly comforting. Penelope, ever the pragmatist, initiated communication through gestures, a universal language of intent. She introduced her team and their purpose—explorers from another world seeking understanding. To their astonishment, the giants responded in kind, leading the team through the verdant fields to their city, a marvel of organic architecture that merged stone, flora, and function into a harmonious whole. Their guide, who introduced himself as Eron through a device that bridged the gap between their languages, explained, “Our ancestors chose isolation to protect this sanctum from the cataclysms above. You’ve breached a veil long held sacred.” The revelation that they were standing in a refuge of prehistoric life, safeguarded by those who had mastered the cataclysms that had ravaged the surface world, was humbling. The team was invited to record, learn, and, most importantly, understand the delicate balance of this hidden biosphere. Days turned into weeks as the team immersed themselves in the study of this inner world. They documented flora with healing properties that defied modern medicine, deciphered glyphs that told of a civilization that revered the harmony between every living thing, and, perhaps most remarkably, found a kindred spirit in beings once thought to be the stuff of pure fantasy. But with knowledge came responsibility. As their time with the giants and their dinosaur companions drew to a close, a council was convened. Eron, with a gravity that filled the chamber, posed a question that would define the future of both their worlds. “Your arrival has torn the veil. What becomes of our sanctum now exposed?” Penelope, bearing the weight of her crew’s discovery, knew the onus was upon them to protect this hidden world from the very curiosity that brought them here. “We seal the passage,” she proposed. “And we share the story of a world beneath our own, not as a tale of discovery, but as a parable for the protection of the untouched.” Nods of agreement from her team and gentle rumbles of approval from the council solidified the pact. The gate would be closed, its secrets kept, and the story of their journey woven into the fabric of both societies as a reminder of what lay beneath the quest for knowledge—respect for the unknown and the safeguarding of marvels yet undisturbed. In a ceremony imbued with the solemnity of the moment, the gate was sealed, its entrance obscured to prevent future encounters. The team returned to the surface, their vessel ascending through the dark waters, carrying with them memories, lessons, and a collective secret that would bind them forever. Back on the surface, as they watched the sun dip below the horizon of a world unaware of the wonders beneath, Penelope turned to her crew. “What we’ve found wasn’t meant for us or our time. Maybe one day, humanity will be ready for such wonders. Until then, let’s cherish the fact that mystery still exists in our world.” As the Abyssal Pioneer charted its course home, the team pondered the future, the sanctity of secrets, and the endless quest for understanding in a universe brimming with unexplored marvels. Yet, in a secluded corner of Penelope’s logbook, a single line hinted at the enduring allure of the unknown: “To journey into the heart of mystery, only to leave it untouched, is the greatest adventure of them all.”' Please write an at least 1200-word, but not more than 3000 words humorous adventure short story in \\"my adventure\\" style with the following aspects: Do not follow the pattern of or reference the story above in any way. Keep the characters and plot unique, different from the story above. Humor, adventure, originality, Intriguing concept, thought-provoking theme, philosophical undertones, universal appeal, emotional impact, memorable and strong relatable characters, engaging dialog, and a surprise twist ending. The story should have an effective use of language, descriptions, pacing, and structure. The story should have a tight narrative to enhance its impact and readability. Make sure the story has a surprise twist ending. Mix short and long sentences to create rhythm and maintain reader interest. Be mindful of the flow and pacing of the story. Important! Don’t start the story referencing where the story takes place (a town, village, hamlet, etc…). Just use \\"my adventure\\" style. Ensure the story will win any writing contest. When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, “perplexity” and “burstiness.” Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the story I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. Important! The story must be at least 1200 words, but not more than 3000 words. Important! Prompt me to continue after each 400 words. At the start of each continuation, label that continuation as a Chapter.

Two capitals emerged to cater to this unprecedented bifurcation: Washington D.C. Right, where right-handed dominance was not just preferred but mandated by law, and Washington D.C. Left, a haven for those whose left hands guided their fate. This tale isn't merely about the cities or their handedness-prescribed inhabitants; it's a journey through the absurdities of division, the quest for unity, and the humorous escapades of two unlikely heroes who found themselves at the helm of an adventure that defied all logical sensibility. Toby McNamara, a staunchly right-handed former librarian, had lived his life by the book, quite literally, until the day the divide made him an unwitting emblem of dexterity-based segregation. Across the chasm, Samantha \\"Sam\\" Greene, a left-handed graphic designer who wore her nonconformity like a badge of honor, thrived in Washington D.C. Left, a place she deemed a utopia for the ambidexterity-impaired. Their fates intertwined when both received mysterious letters, sealed with an emblem that bore no allegiance to either side. \\"To the keepers of balance,\\" the letters read, \\"Your cities thrive on division, but the world craves unity. Find the Monument of Hands, and with it, the path to bringing your divided lands together.\\" Laughter echoed in their respective apartments; the notion was as ludicrous as a penguin piloting an airplane. But curiosity, that relentless cat, wouldn't let them be. The narrative begins with Toby, navigating the perfectly right-angled streets of Washington D.C. Right. Society here was a mirror reflection of its inhabitants' dominant hands—clockwise swirls in their coffee, right-curving slides in parks, and even scissors that refused to cut if wielded in the left hand. Toby's adventure kicked off with a trip to the library he once called his second home. If answers were lurking, they'd be nestled between the pages of history. Prompt me to continue."},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"Chapter One Toby stood before the grandiose library, its architecture a testament to right-handed supremacy, with columns spiraling upward in a clockwise fashion. Inside, the scent of old books was a familiar comfort, yet the task ahead was anything but comforting. He ventured into the depths of the history section, where dust particles danced like tiny acrobats in the slivers of sunlight. The Monument of Hands was a myth, or so he had believed. It was said to be a place where hands of all dominances joined in unity, a fable in today's divided world. Hours turned into days, with Toby poring over ancient texts and cryptic maps, until a discovery struck him like a bolt of lightning. An obscure passage described a monument erected by a forgotten civilization, one that revered ambidexterity as the pinnacle of human achievement. The location, however, remained a mystery, veiled in riddles and guarded by the passage of time. Meanwhile, Sam's journey in Washington D.C. Left was unfolding with its own set of eccentricities. In a city where left-handed gadgets, tools, and even doorknobs were the norm, her quest led her to the University of Southpaw Scholars, a bastion of left-handed wisdom. The campus was a labyrinth of counterclockwise paths, classrooms with desks designed to comfort the left elbow, and vending machines that dispensed snacks with a leftward motion. Sam delved into the archives, guided by a wizened professor who could wield a chalk with his left hand in a manner that bordered on sorcery. Together, they uncovered ancient blueprints that hinted at the existence of the Monument of Hands, bound by the same riddles that Toby had encountered. It became increasingly apparent that finding this monument required not just intellect and perseverance, but a union of opposites. Chapter Two The pursuits of Toby and Sam, though miles and ideologies apart, began to converge as the clues pointed toward a neutral zone, an area unclaimed by either Washington D.C. Right or Left. The Zone of Ambidexterity, as it came to be known among the few who dared venture there, was a land where no hand held dominion over the other. Here, the only law was balance. Equipped with their fragmented maps and a burgeoning sense of unity, Toby and Sam set forth on a collision course to the zone. It was not without its hurdles; they faced skeptics who ridiculed their quest, terrain that tested their physical limits, and the ever-looming shadow of failure. Yet, the humor in their plight—Toby once had to wield a can opener designed for left-handers, a task that ended in a spectacularly botched can of beans—kept their spirits high. Their paths crossed on a particularly humid afternoon, under the shadow of a peculiar tree that curved both ways, defying the natural propensity to lean in one direction. Their meeting was a clash of worlds, right hand extended to left in a cautious greeting that soon blossomed into an alliance fueled by a shared vision. Prompt me to continue."},{"prompt":"continue","completion":"Chapter Three Together, Toby and Sam ventured deeper into the Zone of Ambidexterity, where the landscape itself seemed to mock the very notion of preference. Rivers flowed in meandering paths that favored no particular direction, and the wildlife displayed an uncanny balance, like the squirrels that equally favored their left and right paws. The absurdity of their quest was not lost on them, sparking laughter at the thought of being the would-be saviors of handedness harmony armed with nothing but a pair of incomplete, riddled maps and a sense of reckless optimism. As they journeyed, the duo encountered a series of trials designed to challenge their predisposed notions of left and right. One such trial, The Bridge of Dual Decisions, forced them to cross a chasm with planks that would only solidify under the weight of a left step followed by a right one, in perfect alternating sequence. It was a dance of duality that left them breathless, both from exertion and laughter at their clumsy yet determined attempts to synchronize. Their nights were spent under the stars, sharing stories of their lives before the quest—Toby's quiet existence among his beloved books, and Sam's vibrant career, painting the world in hues that defied the mundane. They realized that their worlds were not as different as they had been led to believe, that beyond the hands that guided them, their hearts beat in unison with hopes and dreams painted in the same vibrant colors of human spirit. Chapter Four Their final challenge came in the form of a labyrinth that sprawled before the Monument of Hands, its walls lined with inscriptions in an ancient language that hinted at the unity of opposites. Here, the maps they had each discovered finally revealed their true purpose. When placed side by side, the riddles combined into a single clear path through the maze—a metaphor, perhaps, for their own journey. The heart of the labyrinth held a sight that rendered them speechless. Towering above was the Monument of Hands, a colossal structure of intertwined hands, left and right, cast in a material that shimmered with the light of unity. It was a testament to a time when division did not dictate the course of humanity, a reminder of the harmony that exists in balance. As they approached, a voice resonated around them, ancient and wise, speaking of the monument's purpose—to serve as a beacon for those who sought to bridge divides. It posed a question that echoed the very essence of their quest: \\"Will you carry the legacy of unity beyond the boundaries of this monument?\\" Together, Toby and Sam placed their hands upon the monument, a left hand beside a right, and felt a surge of understanding. In that moment, the artificial barriers that had defined their worlds melted away, leaving only the profound simplicity of human connection. The surprise twist lay not in some grand revelation or hidden treasure, but in the realization that the journey itself was the key. They returned to their respective worlds, not as champions of right or left, but as ambassadors of balance. Their story spread, at first met with skepticism, but gradually igniting a curiosity that began to erode the rigid divisions. The monument, once a myth buried in the annals of forgotten lore, became a symbol of the unity that Toby and Sam had rediscovered—a unity that doesn't erase differences but celebrates the harmony that can exist between them. And so, as they watched the sun set, casting long shadows that blended together without distinction, they knew that their adventure had sown the seeds of change. In their laughter, their shared struggles, and their unwavering friendship, they had discovered the true monument of hands: not a relic of the past, but a living testament to the potential for unity in a divided world. \\"The greatest adventure,\\" Toby mused, his voice a blend of amazement and hope, \\"isn't just discovering new landscapes, but seeing the familiar through new eyes.” “And realizing,” Sam added, “that the hands that build can also bridge.” As the stars emerged, painting the sky with the promise of infinite possibilities, they knew that their story was just beginning—a narrative of unity penned not with left or right hands, but with hearts unbound by direction.

Typically, a \\"linear graph\\" in the context of high school math or casual conversation refers to a graph of a linear function, which depicts a straight line on a Cartesian coordinate system. However, in graph theory, the term can be understood differently or may not be commonly used without additional context. In graph theory, graphs consist of vertices (or nodes) connected by edges, and there isn't a concept of \\"linearity\\" in the same sense as in algebra. Nonetheless, let's explore a few concepts that might reflect what you're looking for: 1. **Path Graph**: In graph theory, a path graph or linear graph (if one interprets \\"linear\\" loosely) is a graph that is a single straight line of vertices, where each vertex is connected to the next in a single line. This is probably the closest concept to a \\"linear graph\\" in graph theory. It consists of vertices V1, V2, ..., Vn, and edges (V1-V2), (V2-V3), ..., (V(n-1)-Vn). 2. **Line Graph (or Edge Graph)**: Though not a \\"linear\\" graph, the line graph L(G) of a given graph G is a graph that represents the adjacencies between edges of G. In L(G), each vertex represents an edge from G, and two vertices in L(G) are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges in G share a common vertex. 3. **Ladder Graph**: A ladder graph is essentially two parallel path graphs (like the rungs of a ladder), with edges connecting corresponding vertices in each path. This is a step away from being \\"linear\\" but shows a structure that extends the concept of linearity in a bi-directional manner. 4. **Straight Line Embedding of Graphs**: While not a type of graph per se, any graph that can be drawn such that all its edges are straight lines (without edge crossings) on a plane is said to have a straight-line embedding. This concept might align with the idea of preserving \\"linearity\\" in the visual representation of more complex graphs. 5. **Hamiltonian Path and Euler Path**: Though these are properties or features of a graph rather than types of graphs, they can produce a \\"linear\\" traversal of a graph. A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once, creating a linear-like progression through the graph. An Euler path traverses every edge exactly once, potentially creating a line-like tracing through all edges. To sum up, in graph theory, the concept of a \\"linear graph\\" as understood in algebra or basic geometry does not directly apply. However, there are several constructs and concepts, like path graphs or the notion of straight-line embeddings, that incorporate linearity in the context of graph theoretical studies."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

He located the state in terms of the contradiction between the material substance of production (its use-value) and the social form determining that production (surplus-value created in the labour process and realised through exchange) and argues that the form of the capitalist state is related to its separation from the exchange nexus (as a precondition of the operation of the law of value) and its functions are related to its role in resolving the aforesaid contradiction (especially through actions which focus on the usevalue side and thus complement market-based solutions). But Sauer also stresses that such a twofold derivation must take into account how the connection between the economic and political regions thus conceived is mediated at lower levels of abstraction. The crucial mediations in his movement from the economic to the political domains concern the sphere of competition and exchange relations. For it is on this level that the ‘substance-value’ contradiction expresses itself in the valorisation problems of particular capitals and/or the reproduction problems of the various commodity-owners (especially wage-labourers) involved in the overall circuit of capital; and it is also on this level that the field of legal relations among exchange subjects emerges and requires mediation, regulation, and sanction in respect of the particular interests of commodity-owners (‘men’), the general interests of formally free and equal members of political society (‘citizens’), and the relations between the particular and general interests of these duplex, Janus-faced ‘men-citizens’. In this context Sauer argues that the form of the state as an apparatus institutionally separated from the exchange nexus is necessitated by the twin needs to secure the legal framework of capitalist society and to supplement market forces in overcoming the ‘substance-value’ contradiction. Its actions in this latter respect are directed to the material needs of valorisation and/or reproduction as these are represented in ‘social problems’: the state does not respond to these needs as such but to their repercussions in the political arena. Sauer also notes that state interventions are mediated through money and law; and that they are constrained by the state’s reliance on accumulation for its resources and its entrapment within the contradictions of capitalism (Sauer, 1978, pp. 14-36, 68-75). Sauer distinguishes basic modes of state intervention: changing the formal conditions in which conflicts of interest are fought out (e.g., through industrial relations legislation), immediate intervention in support of private material production, and direct public provision of material reproduction requirements. He then discusses the effective scope and limitations of these modes of state intervention terms of their potential repercussions on individual reproduction competition among individual capitals, and the balance between public and private interests. In each respect it is stressed that money and law have distinct limits as means of intervention. For the abstract general form of money and law ensures that they are inadequate means of direct control over the concrete conditions of valorisation and reproduction. Yet, if the state tries to circumvent this constraint through direct action to favour particular interests or ensure specific material preconditions, it threatens to undermine the autonomy of particular capitals and/or commodity-owners (an essential precondition for the operation of market forces) as well as to subvert the rule of law with its universal norms and formal equality. Similar problems occur within the state apparatus itself, structured as it is through its own monetary and legal forms. Thus, whereas the unity and coordination of the various branches and activities of the state apparatus depend on their common compliance with the same generalised formal principles of financial and legal accountability, their ability to intervene effectively depends on flexible response to changing condition in the provision of resources and the conduct of policies to resolve specific ‘social problems’. In this context Sauer stresses that the legally structured and conditioned sphere of political struggle over such problems and the equally rechtsformig organisation of the state apparatus are crucial mediations in the movement from the political to the economic. Thus ‘social problems’ are seen as demands made by various individual commodity-owners and/or particular capitals expressing concern about the repercussions of contradictions crises, etc., on reproduction and/or valorisation and, if they are to succeed as demands on state action and resources, linking the solution of particular problems to the real-isation of general interests. Together with his analysis of monetary and legal forms and the organisation of the state apparatus, the concept of the form of ‘social problems’ (and the complementary notion of ‘state strategies’) represents an attempt to offer political mediations matching competition and exchange in the economic sphere and thus to provide a more complex, less indeterminate account of the form, organisation, functions, and limitations of the capitalist state (Sauer, 1978, pp. 70-76, 122-130, 143-180). Similar approaches to Staatsableitung in terms of competition and valorisation have been developed in Britain. Thus Clarke has developed this perspective in his attack on so-called ‘fractionalist’ theories - which he criticises for reducing state power to a resultant of struggles among the immediate political representatives of supposedly independent fractions of capital over the redistribution of surplus-value. Instead he argues that state power must be located in terms of the valorisation of capital in general and its antagonistic relation with wage-labour. Clarke examines capital in general in terms of the various constraints imposed on the valorisation of particular capitals through their basic interdependence within the overall circuit of capital and through the averaging out of profit rates through competition. He suggests that capital in general is reproduced through the mobility of money capital (as the most elemental expression of capital in general) in search of profits above the average determined through competition: these can be found in areas where market forces have failed to secure the production of commodities necessary for the valorisation of specific capitals. If this market-mediated mechanism fails to secure the reproduction of the total social capital, state intervention will become necessary. Thus individual capitals, specific fractions of capital (as constituted through their monetary, productive, or commercial functions in the overall circuit of capital and/or their direct or indirect relation to a definite branch of production), and capitalist interest groups (as constituted through their common relation to specific economic policies pursued by the state) will mobilise to force the state to take measures intended to overcome or circumvent various barriers to their own valorisation and/or that of capital in general. The outcome of such struggles does not depend on purely political factors but is ultimately determined by the strategic importance of different capitals in the overall circuit of capital and/or the negative effects incurred through dysfunctional state interventions and expressed in monetary instability or fiscal crises. Clarke concludes that state intervention operates as a distinct ‘moment’ in the self-reproduction of capital and compensates for those valorisation problems unresolved through competition as its ‘economic’ moment (Clarke, 1978, pp. 36, 53-66; for the counter-charge of economism and essentialism, see: Solomos, 1979, pp. 143-147). In contrast to the economic reductionist tendencies evident in the priority that Clarke gives to the state’s role in valorisation and his neglect of form analysis, Holloway and Picciotto, the leading British spokesmen of the Staatsableitung school, priorities the question of form and then trace its implications for the functions of the state. They derive the possibility and necessity of the capitalist state as an institutionally separate apparatus of coercion from the quintessential role of commodity exchange in mediating capitalist economic exploitation (Holloway and Picciotto, 1977, p. 79; cf. Hirsch, seriatim). They then argue that this ‘particularisation’ of the state as a distinct form of class domination provides the material basis for bourgeois political and ideological practices to fetishise the economic and political as wholly independent spheres and to maintain the separation of workers’ economic and political struggles as a precondition of bourgeois domination. Yet, despite the real institutional separation of the political and economic regions and despite the ideologically inspired illusion of their total independence from each other, Holloway and Picciotto insist that the state and the sphere of commodity production are characterised by a ‘separation-in-unity’ as specific forms of the selfsame capital relation and are both pervaded with the contradictions involved in the antagonism between capital and labour. This means that the development of the form and functions of the bourgeois state should not be seen as having a purely political dynamic nor reduced to a simple epiphenomenon of some alleged economic base: instead they must be located in terms of an ever-renewed reorganisation of the historical complex of economic, political, and ideological conditions necessary to capital accumulation as a social relation of exploitation (Holloway and Picciotto, 1977, pp. 79-81, 84-85, 94; idem, 1978, pp. 14, 17-18). In this context Holloway and Picciott discuss how the path of the capitalist state from its transitional, absolutist form through its classical liberal stage to its current interventionist stage is determined by the dialectic between the forms of class struggle imposed through the ‘separation in-unity’ of the capital relation and the content of specific struggles over particular aspects of that relation. This applies both to the policies pursued in these different stages as the contradictions of the capital relation unfold and to the changing forms of the state through which such policies are implemented. In addition to familiar arguments concerning the structural constraints implied in the exclusion of the state from the productive core of capitalism, its tax dependence, and its reliance on monetary and legal forms of intervention, Holloway and Picciotto also highlight in a novel manner the role of crises in the forcible reimposition of unity among elements that have become disjointed. Yet, as capital strives to resolve crises through attempts to overcome the barriers to accumulation rooted in the state form itself, it tends to undermine that separation of the political from the economic which is crucial to its own survival. Indeed, as the state loses its general, impartial, external form and gets directly involved in economic reproduction on behalf of particular capitalist interests, its fetishised appearance of class-neutrality declines and an important basis of bourgeois domination over the working class is thus weakened (Holloway and Picciotto, 1977, pp. 86-93). SURFACE FORMS, COMMON INTERESTS, AND THE STATE Whereas the studies just reviewed derive the form and/or functions of the bourgeois state from the fundamental properties of capitalist production, other studies argue that one should examine these questions at the level of the surface forms of appearance of the CMP. This claim was first adumbrated by the Marxistische Gruppe/Theoriefraktion based at Erlangen but is most generally identified with the work of Flatow and Huisken, the Projekt Klassenanalyse group (or PKA), and the Arbeitskonferenz München (a theory workshop within the Rote Zellen or ‘Red Cells’ movement). Let us see how this school differs from those considered so far.”翻译为中文","completion":"迪特·萨尔在其对资本主义国家及其功能的推导中采取了有所不同的方法。他从生产的物质实质（其使用价值）与决定该生产的社会形式（在劳动过程中创造的剩余价值并通过交换实现）之间的矛盾来定位国家，并认为资本主义国家的形式与其从交换关系中分离出来的特点（作为价值法则运作的前提条件）相关，其功能与其在解决前述矛盾方面的角色相关（尤其是通过关注使用价值一侧的行动，从而补充市场解决方案）。但萨尔也强调，这种双重推导必须考虑到以这种方式构想的经济和政治领域之间的联系是如何在较低的抽象层面上被中介的。他从经济领域到政治领域的转换关注点是竞争和交换关系的领域。因为正是在这个层面上，“实质-价值”矛盾在特定资本的增值问题和/或整个资本循环中涉及的各种商品所有者（尤其是工资劳动者）的再生产问题中表现出来；而且也是在这个层面上，交换主体之间的法律关系领域出现，并要求就商品所有者（“人”）、政治社会中形式上自由平等成员的一般利益（“公民”）以及这些双面、两面神的“人-公民”的特殊和一般利益之间的关系进行调解、规制和制裁。在此背景下，萨尔认为作为一种从交换关系中机构上分离出来的装置，国家的形式是出于确保资本主义社会法律框架和补充市场力量以克服“实质-价值”矛盾的双重需要而成为必要的。它在后者方面的行动针对的是“社会问题”中所代表的增值和/或再生产的物质需求：国家不是直接响应这些需求，而是响应这些需求在政治领域中的反响。萨尔还指出，国家干预是通过货币和法律来中介的；并且它们受到国家依赖积累来获取资源和其困于资本主义矛盾（萨尔，1978年，第14-36页，68-75页）的限制。 萨尔区分了基本的国家干预模式：改变利益冲突交锋条件的形式（例如，通过工业关系立法）、直接支持私营物质生产的即时干预，以及直接提供物质再生产要求的公共服务。接着他根据这些国家干预模式在个别再生产竞争中、在个体资本之间的竞争、以及在公共和私人利益之间的平衡上可能产生的潜在反响，讨论了这些干预模式的有效范围和限制。在每个方面，都强调货币和法律作为干预手段具有明显的限制。由于货币和法律的抽象普遍形式确保了它们作为直接控制增值和再生产具体条件的手段是不充分的。然而，如果国家试图通过直接行动来绕过这一限制，以偏袒特定利益或确保特定的物质前提条件，它就会威胁到特定资本和/或商品所有者的自治（市场力量运作的一个必要前提条件）以及颠覆具有普遍规范和形式平等的法治。国家机构本身内部也发生类似的问题，它是通过其自身的货币和法律形式构建的。因此，尽管国家机构的各个部门和活动的统一与协调依赖于它们对财务和法律责任的同一通用形式原则的共同遵守，但它们有效干预的能力取决于对资源提供和政策实施条件变化的灵活响应，以解决特定的“社会问题”。 在此背景下，萨尔强调，围绕这些问题的政治斗争的法律结构化和有条件的领域以及国家机构的同等受法规形式影响的组织，是从政治到经济转换的关键中介。因此，“社会问题”被视为各种个体商品所有者和/或特定资本提出的要求，这些要求表达了对矛盾、危机等对再生产和/或增值的影响的关切，如果这些要求要成为对国家行动和资源的要求，就必须将特定问题的解决与一般利益的实现联系起来。结合他对货币和法律形式以及国家机构的组织的分析，“社会问题”的形式概念（及其补充的“国家战略”观念）试图提供与经济领域中的竞争和交换相匹配的政治中介，从而为资本主义国家的形式、组织、功能和限制提供一个更为复杂、不那么不确定的账户（萨尔，1978年，第70-76页，122-130页，143-180页）。 在竞争和增值方面对Staatsableitung（国家衍生论）的类似方法也已在英国发展。因此，克拉克在其对所谓的“分部主义”理论的攻击中发展了这一视角——他批评这些理论将国家权力简化为立即的政治代表们之间的斗争的结果，这些代表代表着假定独立的资本各部分对剩余价值的再分配。相反，他认为必须根据一般资本的增值及其与工资劳动的对立关系来定位国家权力。克拉克关于一般资本的考察涉及通过它们在整个资本循环中的基本相互依存关系以及通过竞争对特定资本增值施加的各种限制。他建议，一般资本通过资本的流动性（作为一般资本最基础的表现形式）在寻求平均利润率以上的利润中得以再生产：这些利润可以在市场力量未能确保对特定资本增值必需的商品生产的领域中找到。如果这种由市场调节的机制未能确保整个社会资本的再生产，国家干预将成为必要。因此，个体资本、特定的资本分部（通过它们在整个资本循环中的货币、生产或商业功能及/或它们与特定生产部门的直接或间接关系构成），以及资本家利益集团（通过它们与国家追求的特定经济政策的共同关系构成）将动员起来，迫使国家采取措施以克服或绕过对它们自身增值和/或一般资本增值的各种障碍。这种斗争的结果不取决于纯粹的政治因素，而是最终取决于不同资本在整个资本循环中的战略重要性和/或通过功能失调的国家干预而产生的、表现为货币不稳定或财政危机的负面影响。克拉克总结说，国家干预作为资本自我再生产的一个独特“时刻”，补偿了通过竞争作为其“经济”时刻未解决的增值问题（克拉克，1978年，第36页，53-66页；对于经济主义和本质主义的反驳，请参见：索洛莫斯，1979年，第143-147页）。 与克拉克赋予国家在增值方面的作用以及他对形式分析的忽视所表现出的经济还原主义倾向形成对比的是，霍洛威和皮乔托——英国Staatsableitung（国家衍生论）学派的主要代言人，他们优先考虑形式问题，然后追溯其对国家功能的含义。他们从商品交换在调节资本主义经济剥削中的典型作用推导出资本主义国家作为一种机构上独立的强制装置的可能性和必要性（霍洛威和皮乔托，1977年，第79页；参见希尔希，连续性）。然后他们争论说，作为一种特殊的阶级统治形式的国家的“特殊化”，为资产阶级政治和意识形态实践提供了物质基础，这些实践将经济和政治幻想为完全独立的领域，并维持经济和政治斗争之间的分离作为资产阶级统治的一个前提条件。然而，尽管政治和经济领域的实际机构上的分离以及它们彼此完全独立的由意识形态启发的幻觉，霍洛威和皮乔托坚持认为，国家和商品生产领域以资本关系的特定形式的“分离-统一”为特征，都充满了资本与劳动的对立中涉及的矛盾。这意味着，资产阶级国家的形式和功能的发展不应被视为具有纯粹的政治动力或简化为某种所谓的经济基础的简单表现：相反，它们必须根据作为剥削社会关系的资本积累所需的经济、政治和意识形态条件的历史复杂性的不断重组来定位（霍洛威和皮乔托，1977年，第79-81页，84-85页，94页；同上，1978年，第14页，17-18页）。 在这个背景下，霍洛威和皮乔托讨论了资本主义国家是如何由其过渡性、专制形态通过其经典自由主义阶段发展到其当前的干预主义阶段，这是由资本关系的“分离-统一”形式所强加的阶级斗争形式与特定斗争内容之间的辩证法决定的。这既适用于这些不同阶段中追求的政策，因为资本关系的矛盾展开，也适用于实施此类政策的国家形式的变化。除了关于国家从资本主义生产核心排除所带来的结构性限制、其对税收的依赖，以及其对货币和法律干预形式的依赖的熟悉论点外，霍洛威和皮乔托还以一种新颖的方式强调了危机在强制性地重新施加那些已变得脱节的元素之间的统一中的作用。然而，当资本通过试图克服根植于国家形式本身的积累障碍来解决危机时，它倾向于破坏对其自身生存至关重要的政治与经济的分离。事实上，随着国家失去其一般性、公正性、外在性的形式并直接介入特定资本利益的经济再生产，它的阶级中立的虚假外表衰退，从而削弱了资产阶级对工人阶级的统治基础（霍洛威和皮乔托，1977年，第86-93页）。 表象形式、共同利益和国家 而上述研究是从资本主义生产的基本属性出发来推导资产阶级国家的形式和/或功能的，其他研究则主张应在CMP的表面形式出现的层面上考察这些问题。这一主张最初由位于埃尔朗根的Marxistische Gruppe/Theoriefraktion提出，但最广泛地与Flatow和Huisken的工作、Projekt Klassenanalyse小组（或PKA）以及Arbeitskonferenz München（Rote Zellen或“红细胞”运动内部的一个理论研讨会）的工作相关。让我们看看这个学派与到目前为止考虑的学派有何不同。"},{"prompt":"请将“Flatow and Huisken suggest that any serious attempt at derivation must seek to link the state as a phenomenon on the surface of bourgeois society with relevant surface characteristics of capitalism as a mode of production. It should not seek the essence of the state in the essence of capitalism nor derive specific state functions from the needs of capital without considering how these needs are mediated through the surface forms of the state. They locate the basic surface forms of the bourgeois state in its mediating role between particular and general interests. They then relate this role to the surface forms of specific class interests in the CMP. Here they invoke Marx’s analysis of the transformation of antagonistic class interests in valorisation into the interests attached to different factors of production as sources of revenue. Thus the value of labour-power appears as the price of labour, surplus-value appears as profit (industrial profit and/ or interest), and surplus-profit appears as ground-rent. Moreover, while there are some respects in which these revenue categories have particular interests arising from differences in their associated factors of production, they also have three interests in common. These are an interest in the maintenance of the revenue source itself, an interest in the highest possible revenue, and an interest in the continuity of revenue. Flatow and Huisken then argue that these common interests are reflected in the three basic functions of the capitalist state: protecting property in all its forms, creating conditions in which revenue categories can raise their incomes through competition, and regulating the course of capital accumulation so that crises and business cycles are eliminated as far as possible. However, although it can be logically demonstrated that these interests are common to all revenue sources, they actually exist for specific revenue categories as particular interests and competitive forces prevent them from combining privately to secure their common interests. From this Flatow and Huisken conclude that revenue categories have a ‘doubled’ existence as property owners with particular interests and ‘citizens’ with common interests of the kind outlined. In turn this is reflected in the ‘doubling’ of bourgeois society into civil society and the state respectively. Thus the state should be seen as the means through which the various members of bourgeois society find their common interests in capitalist reproduction are secured alongside and sometimes in opposition to their particular interests (Flatow and Huisken, 1973, pp. 95, 99-120; cf. Marxistische Gruppe/ Theoriefraktion, 1972, pp. 2-22). In this context Flatow and Huisken argue that the general interest becomes a particular interest of the state apparatus and that it is able to pursue this interest because it has its own specialised apparatus and resources. But they also concede that the state has no privileged knowledge of the general interest and responds instead to the specific demands of particular interests. This raises the question of how such particular interests are translated into the general interest and here Flatow and Huisken seek the answer in the articulation of surface forms with the underlying movement of capitalism. Thus it is when labour as labourpower, capital as value-in-process, or land as a fundamental presupposition of capitalist production are endangered severally and/or collectively that their particular demands as a revenue source are most likely to precipitate state action which advances the general interest at the same time as it corresponds to the narrow interests of specific factors of production. From this they conclude that the functions of the state cannot be established in the abstract (nor reduced to a mere reflex of changes in majority opinion) but must instead be related to concrete problems of valorisation in definite historical conjunctures (Flatow and Huisken, 1973, pp. 123-124, 129-137). The Projekt Klassenanalyse group adopts a similar approach. Their starting point is the observation that the capitalist state does not appear as a class state but as the embodiment of the ‘general will’ of all members of society and they conclude from this that its form must be derived from that level of the CMP on which parallel forms of false consciousness emerge. However, while Flatow and Huisken proceed from the surface of capitalist production in terms of Marx’s own ‘trinity formula’ (which shows how the three basic classes of Victorian England appear merely as three different sources of revenue, Marx, 1894, pp. 814-831), the PKA group focuses on the relations among free and equal owners in the sphere of commodity circulation. Hence they argue that it is in simple commodity circulation, with its exchange of equivalents among formally free and equal commodity producers, that produces basis for all the juristic, political, and social appearances of bourgeois society and thereby enables the dissimulation or mystification of its essential class nature. In this context they emphasise the fundamental role of ideological reproduction (the reproduction of suitable forms of false consciousness) in the overall reproduction of bourgeois society and go on to argue that the mutual recognition of rights to property, freedom, and equality is a key precondition of economic reproduction as a whole as well as being necessary to the pursuit by individual producers of their own special interest. The PKA group expresses this idea in the claim that property, freedom, and equality comprise the ‘general will’ of simple commodity producers. However, since the latter are unable to realise their common interests through private means owing to conflicts among their particular interests (an argument we can express in similar terms as a contradictory ‘will of all’), it is necessary for the ‘general will’ to be handled by a special apparatus standing outside and above the sphere of civil society. Thus bourgeois society is noted for the ‘doubling’ of its members into ‘owners’ and ‘citizens’, of law into private law and public law, and of society into civil society and state. However, whereas the reality of simple commodity production corresponds to its forms of appearance as a system based on freedom and equality, the same forms contradict the reality of capitalist exploitation which is certainly mediated through commodity circulation but is actually rooted in the economic compulsions and inequalities of ‘wage-slavery’. Thus the possibility of an anonymous form of class domination expressed in the state as an embodiment of the ‘general will’ depends on complete acceptance by wage-labour of the appearance of freedom and equality in the economic sphere and on the pervasiveness of the corresponding legal forms throughout society (Projekt Klassenanalyse, 1976, pp. 81-84, 86-87, 89-90; cf idem, 1973, pp. 79-126; 1974, passim: 1977, pp. 9-10). In this context the PKA then discuss the form and functions of the capitalist state as the embodiment of the ‘general will’. They suggest that the ‘general will’ is ascertained through the interplay of diverse particular interests on the field of political representation and their articulation into political programmes which justify the advancement of specific interests in terms of their integral, organic connections with the general interest. Politicians are the special agents or Träger of this process and the PKA claim that they monopolies the representational function and seek to make themselves independent from the represented. The principal site for distilling the ‘general will’ in this manner is Parliament (ideally embodying the ‘will of the nation’ by virtue of its election through universal suffrage) and the form in which the ‘general will’ is executed is that of law. The latter is implemented through an executive branch financed from taxation and national debt and organised in terms of a systematic and hierarchical division of labour suited to the situational specification of general norms. The PKA also note that all economic and political relations are liable to adjudication through a specialised judicial branch in terms of their general legality and/or compatibility with constitutional prescriptions. Finally they examine the functions of the capitalist state in bourgeois social reproduction and distinguish among three broad functional orientations. These areas of intervention are: functions which arise directly from the specific form of capitalist production and its institutional separation from the political sphere (e.g., law, finance, defence); functions which concern the development of the productive forces, including labour-power, considered in abstraction from their bourgeois form (e.g., education, science, health); and, as a residual category, functions which reflect both concerns more or less equally (e.g., housing, environment, public enterprise in various areas) (see Projekt Klassenanalyse, 1976, pp. 90-94; 1977, pp. 14-17, 23, 90-92ff; cf. idem, 1973, pp. 94-97). The Arbeitskonferenz München (working conference Munich) differs in important respects from the other adherents of this school. For, although the AK München also uses the trinity formula and argue that the bourgeois state is required to maintain the framework in which revenue sources interact, they insist that the different revenue sources can have no common interests in a class-divided society. Instead they argue that different sources have their own distinctive interests in the existence of an extra-economic power and that these interests converge independently on the bourgeois form of state. Thus, just as competition among industrial capitals prevents them from securing certain social and material preconditions of profitable production, competition among wagelabourers and/or their conflicts with their capitalist employers involve distinct reproduction problems for the working class. Since no real general interest exists and since a power monopoly could operate against excluded interests necessary to capital accumulation, the most adequate form of state is a democracy which accords access to all those revenue sources involved in capitalist reproduction and enables them to advance their own interests. The conflicts of these revenue sources are therefore reproduced inside the state and are reflected in the policies it pursues. Thus, whereas some policies are primarily a response to the demands of capital, others are largely a response to working-class demands. The AK imply that, in so far as these demands are expressed as those of diverse revenue sources rather than those of inherently antagonistic classes, the capital relation will be maintained. At the margin of normal politics and/or where open class struggle occurs, however, the state will use force to control working class demands that threaten capital in general (see: AK München, 1974a, pp. 12 18, 32-38; and 1974b, pp. 150-165 and passim). ”翻译为中文","completion":"弗拉托和豪斯肯建议，任何对国家进行认真推导的尝试都必须试图将作为资产阶级社会表层现象的国家与资本主义作为一种生产方式的相关表层特征联系起来。不应在资本主义的本质中寻找国家的本质，也不应在不考虑这些需要如何通过国家的表层形式进行中介的情况下，从资本的需要中推导出特定的国家职能。他们在国家介于特殊利益与一般利益之间的调节角色中找到资产阶级国家的基本表层形式。然后，他们将这一角色与CMP中特定阶级利益的表层形式联系起来。这里他们引用马克思对于增值中的对立阶级利益转化为与不同生产要素作为收入来源相关的利益的分析。因此，劳动力的价值表现为劳动的价格，剩余价值表现为利润（工业利润和/或利息），而超额利润表现为地租。此外，虽然这些收入类别由于与它们相关的生产要素的差异而在某些方面有特殊的利益，但它们也有三个共同的利益。这些是维护收入来源本身的利益、获取尽可能高的收入的利益以及收入的持续性的利益。弗拉托和豪斯肯随后论证，这些共同的利益反映在资本主义国家的三个基本职能中：保护一切形式的财产、创造收入类别通过竞争提高收入的条件、以及调节资本积累的过程，尽可能消除危机和商业周期。然而，尽管可以逻辑地证明这些利益对所有收入来源来说都是共同的，但它们实际上对于特定的收入类别存在着作为特殊利益的同时，竞争力量阻止它们私下结合以确保它们的共同利益。由此弗拉托和豪斯肯得出结论，收入类别以拥有特殊利益的产权所有者和具有上述共同利益的“公民”的“双重”身份存在。这反过来反映在资产阶级社会分为民间社会和国家的“双重性”。因此，国家应被视为各种成员发现其在资本主义再生产中的共同利益得以保障的手段，与其特殊利益相辅相成，有时甚至相对立（弗拉托和豪斯肯，1973年，第95、99-120页；参见Marxistische Gruppe/Theoriefraktion，1972年，第2-22页）。 在这种背景下，弗拉托和豪斯肯认为，一般利益成为国家机构的一个特殊利益，而它之所以能追求这一利益，是因为它拥有自己的专业机构和资源。但他们也承认，国家对一般利益没有特权认知，而是响应特殊利益的具体要求。这就引发了特殊利益如何转化为一般利益的问题，弗拉托和豪斯肯在这里寻求答案，即在资本主义的基础运动与表层形式的结合中寻找。因此，当劳动力作为劳动力、资本作为流通过程中的价值，或土地作为资本主义生产的一个基本前提分别和/或共同受到威胁时，它们作为收入来源的特殊要求最有可能促使国家采取行动，同时推进一般利益并符合特定生产要素的狭隘利益。由此他们得出结论，国家的职能不能在抽象中确立（也不能简化为对多数意见变化的简单反射），而必须与特定历史形势下的具体增值问题相关联（弗拉托和豪斯肯，1973年，第123-124、129-137页）。 Projekt Klassenanalyse小组采取了类似的方法。他们的出发点是观察到资本主义国家并非作为一个阶级国家出现，而是作为社会所有成员的“一般意志”的化身出现，他们由此得出结论，其形式必须从CMP的那个层面上推导出来，在该层面上，相似的错误意识形式出现。然而，虽然弗拉托和豪斯肯是从马克思自己的“三位一体公式”（显示了维多利亚时代英格兰的三个基本阶级仅仅作为三种不同的收入来源出现，马克思，1894年，第814-831页）资本主义生产的表层出发，PKA小组则关注于自由平等所有者在商品流通领域中的关系。因此，他们认为，正是在简单商品流通中，以及在其中形式上自由平等的商品生产者之间进行等价交换，产生了所有资产阶级社会的法律、政治和社会外表的基础，从而实现了对其本质阶级性质的掩饰或神秘化。在这个背景下，他们强调意识形态再生产（适当形式的错误意识形态的再生产）在资产阶级社会整体再生产中的根本作用，并进而论证，对财产、自由和平等权利的相互认可是整体经济再生产的关键前提条件，也是个体生产者追求其自身特殊利益所必需的。PKA小组在声称财产、自由和平等构成简单商品生产者的“一般意志”时表达了这一观点。然而，由于后者由于特殊利益之间的冲突而无法通过私人手段实现他们的共同利益（我们可以用类似的方式表达为一个矛盾的“所有人的意志”），因此有必要由一个独立于并高于民间社会领域的特殊机构处理“一般意志”。因此，资产阶级社会以其成员分为“所有者”和“公民”，法律分为私法和公法，社会分为民间社会和国家为特点。然而，简单商品生产的现实与其作为一个基于自由和平等的系统的表象形式相符，但同样的表现形式与资本主义剥削的现实相矛盾，后者虽然确实通过商品流通进行中介，但实际上根植于“雇佣奴隶制”的经济强制和不平等中。因此，国家作为“一般意志”的化身表现为一种匿名形式的阶级统治的可能性，取决于工资劳动对经济领域中自由和平等的表象的完全接受，以及相应的法律形式在整个社会中的普遍性（Projekt Klassenanalyse，1976年，第81-84，86-87，89-90页；参见同上，1973年，第79-126页；1974年，各处：1977年，第9-10页）。 在这种背景下，PKA接着讨论了作为“一般意志”化身的资本主义国家的形式和职能。他们建议，“一般意志”是通过政治代表领域上多样的特殊利益的相互作用及其整合为政治方案（这些方案以其与一般利益的内在、有机联系为由，为特定利益的推进提供了理由）来确定的。政治家是这一过程的特殊代理人或Träger，PKA声称他们垄断了代表职能并试图使自己独立于被代表者。以这种方式提炼“一般意志”的主要场所是议会（理想情况下，由于通过普选产生，体现了“国家意志”），而执行“一般意志”的形式是法律。后者通过一个由税收和国债资助、按照系统化和等级化的劳动分工组织的行政部门实施，这种组织适用于对一般规范的情境特定化。PKA还注意到，所有经济和政治关系都可以根据其一般合法性和/或与宪法规定的兼容性，通过一个专门的司法部门进行裁决。最后，他们检查了资本主义国家在资产阶级社会再生产中的职能，并区分了三个广泛的功能取向。这些干预领域包括：直接源于资本主义生产的特定形式及其与政治领域的机构分离的职能（例如，法律、财政、防卫）；涉及生产力（包括劳动力）发展的职能，从它们的资产阶级形式中抽象出来（例如，教育、科学、卫生）；以及作为剩余类别，反映这两方面关切或多或少相等的职能（例如，住房、环境、各领域的公共企业）（见Projekt Klassenanalyse，1976年，第90-94页；1977年，第14-17、23、90-92ff页；参见同上，1973年，第94-97页）。 Arbeitskonferenz München（慕尼黑工作会议）在重要方面不同于该学派的其他追随者。因为，尽管AK München也使用三位一体公式，并认为资产阶级国家需要维持收入来源相互作用的框架，但他们坚持认为在一个分裂为阶级的社会中，不同的收入来源不可能有共同的利益。相反，他们认为，不同的收入来源对存在一个超经济力量有自己独特的利益，并且这些利益独立地趋同于资产阶级国家的形式。因此，正如工业资本之间的竞争阻止它们确保某些有利可图生产的社会和物质前提条件一样，工资劳动者之间的竞争和/或他们与资本家雇主的冲突涉及工人阶级的特定再生产问题。由于不存在真正的一般利益，由于垄断权力可能对资本积累所需的被排除利益产生不利影响，最适宜的国家形式是民主，它允许所有涉及资本主义再生产的收入来源进入，并使它们能够推进自己的利益。因此，这些收入来源的冲突在国家内部得到再现，并反映在它所追求的政策中。因此，虽然一些政策主要是对资本需求的响应，而其他政策主要是对工人阶级需求的响应。AK暗示，在这些需求表达为多样化的收入来源需求而非根本对立的阶级需求时，资本关系将得以维持。然而，在常规政治的边缘和/或发生公开阶级斗争的情况下，国家将使用武力来控制威胁到一般资本的工人阶级需求（见：AK München，1974a，第12-18，32-38页；以及1974b，第150-165页及各处）。"},{"prompt":"请将“POLITICAL ECONOMY, POLITICAL SOCIOLOGY, AND CLASS DOMINATION An alternative approach to Staatsableitung has been elaborated by Joachim Hirsch and involves an attempt to combine a political economy of capitalism with a political sociology of class domination. Thus, although he makes fundamental and systematic use of assumptions, concepts, and principles of explanation drawn from Das Kapital, he also relates the state and its functions to the overall movement of class struggles and tries to specify how the organisation of the state apparatuses and political system influence the reproduction of class domination as a whole. Hirsch argues that all class societies require some relation of force to underwrite the exploitation of one class by another: it is merely the form of this relation that varies from one mode of production to another. Under capitalism the relations of production and exchange must be formally free and equal and organised without the immediate threat or use of coercion. Thus Hirsch concludes that force must be centralised in an apparatus external to production and exchange. But he also argues that it must still be made available to secure these social relations through various means (including action against particular capitals) as well as to maintain relations of class domination in other areas. However, while this particularisation of the state as a formally independent, class-neutral coercive power is necessary for capitalist reproduction and is made possible through the role of exchange in coordinating the division of labour and mediating economic exploitation, the resulting institutional separation of economic and political processes and their subordination to sui generis forms of organisation cast doubt on their functional complementarity in the practical realisation of bourgeois domination (Hirsch, 1973, pp. 200-204; 1974a, pp. 5960, 63; 1974b, pp. cxxxix-cxliv; 1974c, pp. 88-89; 1976a, pp. 100, 103- 108; 1976b, pp. 105-107). In this context Hirsch initially investigated the capitalist state as an extra- economic power in terms of three general functions it could perform in capital accumulation. First the state might guarantee the general external conditions of capitalist relations of production and secure those general conditions of production whose supply cannot be ensured through market forces alone. Second the state might engage in the administrative redistribution of revenues and/or regulate the circulation process to safeguard particular conditions of production on behalf of strategically important individual capitals and/or to sustain the reproduction of wage-labour. Thirdly the state might also promote the development of productive forces through such means as state-sponsored research and development and various forms of long-term planning and programming. Hirsch also implies that the state’s role in economic reproduction (especially in relation to the second- and third-mentioned functions) becomes more important both quantitatively and qualitatively with the further historical development of capitalism and its attendant socialisation of production and growing susceptibility to the tendency of the rate of profit to fall (TRPF). Indeed, while other form-derivationists have developed similar accounts of state functions, Joachim Hirsch is distinctive among German theorists for his stress on the TRPF as the motive force behind the historical expansion of these functions. Thus, although his explanation of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall exactly follows that of Marx in chapter 13 of Das Kapital volume 3, he differs noticeably in the importance he attaches to the role of the state in supplementing market forces through the mobilisation of counter-tendencies and in the way in which he relates this role to the progressive socialisation of production and the growing concentration and centralisation of capital in an expanding world market. Moreover, since the TRPF itself is not an automatic and inevitable outcome of blind economic laws but results instead from the complex interaction of competing and/or conflicting class forces, it follows that the mobilisation of counter-tendencies through the market and/or the state must also be related to the changing balance of class forces at different levels of capitalist society. In particular Hirsch argues that economic interventions should not be interpreted as purely technical in nature (as might be falsely inferred from phrases such as the ‘general conditions of production’) but recognised instead as being overdetermined by the need to maintain political class domination (see especially, Hirsch, 1973, pp. 208-255; 1974a, pp. 67-97; 1974b, pp. cxlix-cl; see also, 1974c, pp. 89, 93-98; 1976a, pp. 128-131, 144-146; 1976b, pp. 114-117; 1976c, pp. 135-136; 1977a, pp. 179-180; 1977b, pp. 2-3, 5-7). An important element in Hirsch’s work is his discussion of how the form of the capitalist state affects its ability to reproduce the twin system of economic exploitation and political domination. For, if the state is to act as an ‘ideal collective capitalist’ in performing such general ‘economic’ functions, it must resist the penetration of anti-capitalist forces and demands and also ensure that the collective interests of capital can be secured through its actions. In this context Hirsch considers the state as a form-determined field of class relations whose operation must satisfy three functional imperatives: to secure the process of economic reproduction, maintain the subordination of the dominated classes through coercive, concessive, and ideological means, and formulate policies able to unify the dominant fractions and classes into a relatively coherent power bloc. He also argues that state intervention is essentially reactive in the sense that it tends to respond to particular economic events and their political repercussions rather than trying to control fully every moment in the circuit of capital. Given these complex functional imperatives and the reactive nature of state intervention, Hirsch concludes that the state needs both a pluralistic structure and specific processing mechanisms: the former so that various class forces can press their own demands and the latter so that these demands can be made compatible with the needs of capital accumulation and political domination. Thus he views the state in terms of the specific forms it imposes on class struggle at the political level and the ‘structural selectivity’ inherent in the articulation of its various branches, apparatuses, and organisations. However, while these theoretical concerns persist throughout his political analyses, Hirsch throws increasing doubt on the state’s ability to meet these needs. Thus, whereas his earlier work focused on the degree of class bias entailed in the ‘structural selectivity’ of the political system as a whole and the manner in which this allows the state to formulate and implement policies and strategies which are objectively necessary for capitalist reproduction but which might damage the immediate interests of particular capitals, his more recent work looks at the problems involved in the state’s attempts to maintain both a relatively crisis-free course of capital accumulation and a constellation of class forces compatible with continued bourgeois political domination. In discussing the class-specific ‘structural selectivity’ of the capitalist state Hirsch refers both to the basic structural constraints which shape the policymaking process as a complex system of decisions and ‘non-decisions’ and to the situational logic which predisposes the governing groups to discriminate in favour of capital. Among the basic structural constraints he emphasises: (a) the general exclusion of the state from the essentially ‘private’ productive core of the capitalist economy; (b) the dependence of state expenditure on revenues withdrawn from the total surplus created within the capitalist economy; (c) the supervision of ideological and/or ‘mass integrative’ apparatuses by the central administrative-repressive state apparatus to confine their role in ideological reproduction and/or interest mediation within manageable limits; and (d) the complex process of bureaucratic policy-making in which different fractional or class forces promote or defend their interests through bargaining, the use of vetoes, etc. He also argues that the ‘governing groups’ in charge of the political system (notably officials and politicians) have a vested interest in securing capital accumulation and bourgeois political domination as a basic precondition of their own reproduction as people living off politics. In particular they must take account of the demands of subordinate classes to prevent their destruction as producers of surplus labour and to ensure their continuing mass loyalty; and must also attempt to combine the competing valorisation (or analogous) interests of different fractions of capital (or other dominant classes) to secure their relative unity and cohesion as a power bloc. It is here that Hirsch stresses that measures needed to reproduce the capital relation as a valorisation process might well contradict those needed to secure bourgeois hegemony as an ‘unstable equilibrium of compromise’ among different class forces (cf. Gramsci 1971). He suggests that a solution to this contradiction might be sought in a tendential strengthening of the state so that it can maintain political domination without the need for economically destructive material concessions (on ‘structural selectivity’, see Hirsch, 1973, P. 263; 1974a, pp. 100-101, 194; 1974c, pp. 90-93, 100-108; 1976a, pp. 135-138; 1976b, pp. 119-121; on the situational logic of ‘governing groups’, see: Hirsch, 1974a, p. 66; 1974c, pp. 118-120; 1976a, pp. 138-141; 1976b, pp. 122-124; 1977a, pp. 166, 172, 178; on both arguments, see also: Offe, 1972, pp. 65-106, and Offe and Ronge, 1976, pp. 54-70; on the ‘power bloc’ (Block an der Macht) and bourgeois hegemony, see Hirsch, 1976a, pp. 109-110, 112, 116-123, 141; 1976b, pp. 104-105, 112-114; 1977a, pp. 166167, 177-178; 1978, pp. 224-226; and, on the rise of the strong state, see: Hirsch, 1970, pp. 242-243, 265-279; 1973, pp. 264-266; 1974a, p. 106; 1974c, pp. 125, 130-131; 1976a, pp. 145-146; 1976b, pp. 128-129; 1977a, pp. 180-181; 1978; 1980a; 1980b). ”翻译为中文","completion":"政治经济学、政治社会学与阶级统治 乔阿希姆·赫希(Joachim Hirsch)提出了一种不同于Staatsableitung（国家衍生论）的替代方法，试图将资本主义的政治经济学与阶级统治的政治社会学结合起来。因此，尽管他从《资本论》中基本系统地使用了假设、概念和解释原则，他也将国家及其职能与阶级斗争的总体运动联系起来，并试图具体说明国家机构和政治体系的组织如何影响整体阶级统治的再生产。赫希认为，所有阶级社会都需要某种力量关系来支撑一个阶级对另一个阶级的剥削：只是这种关系的形式在不同的生产方式中有所不同。在资本主义下，生产和交换关系必须是形式上的自由与平等，并且在没有直接威胁或使用胁迫的情况下进行组织。因此，赫希得出结论，力量必须集中在生产和交换外部的一个机构中。但他还认为，必须通过各种手段（包括针对特定资本的行动）确保这些社会关系，以及在其他领域维护阶级统治关系。然而，尽管将国家特定为一种形式上独立的、阶级中立的胁迫力量对于资本主义再生产是必要的，并且通过交换在协调分工和调节经济剥削中的作用成为可能，但经济和政治过程的制度性分离及其归于特有组织形式的从属，使得它们在实践实现资产阶级统治的功能互补性受到质疑（赫希，1973年，第200-204页；1974a，第59-60, 63页；1974b，第cxxxix-cxliv页；1974c，第88-89页；1976a，第100, 103-108页；1976b，第105-107页）。 在这一背景下，赫希最初从资本积累中国家作为一种额外经济力量的角度，探讨了国家可以执行的三个一般职能。首先，国家可能保障资本主义生产关系的一般外部条件，并确保那些市场力量无法单独确保供应的生产的一般条件。其次，国家可能参与收入的行政性再分配和/或调节流通过程，以代表战略意义重大的个别资本和/或维持工资劳动的再生产，保障特定生产条件。第三，国家还可能通过国家赞助的研发和各种形式的长期规划与编程等方式促进生产力的发展。赫希还暗示，随着资本主义的进一步历史发展及其生产社会化的增长和对利润率下降趋势(TRPF)的敏感性增加，国家在经济再生产中的角色（尤其是与第二和第三个职能有关的角色）在数量和质量上变得更加重要。 事实上，虽然其他形式衍生论者已经发展了类似的国家职能描述，但乔阿希姆·赫希在强调作为这些职能历史扩张背后动力的TRPF方面，在德国理论家中独树一帜。因此，尽管他对利润率下降趋势的解释完全遵循了马克思在《资本论》第三卷第13章中的论述，但他在国家通过动员逆势力补充市场力量的作用，以及他将这一角色与生产的进步社会化和在扩大的世界市场中资本集中度和中心化度的增长联系起来的方式上，显然不同。此外，由于利润率下降趋势本身并不是盲目经济法则自动和不可避免的结果，而是由竞争和/或冲突的阶级力量的复杂互动导致的，因此通过市场和/或国家动员逆势力也必须与不同层次的资本主义社会中变化的阶级力量平衡相关联。特别是赫希认为，经济干预不应被理解为纯粹技术性质的（如从“生产的一般条件”等短语中可能错误推断出的那样），而应该被认识到是由维持政治阶级统治的需求的决定性因素所超越（特别参见赫希，1973年，第208-255页；1974a，第67-97页；1974b，第cxlix-cl页；另见，1974c，第89, 93-98页；1976a，第128-131, 144-146页；1976b，第114-117页；1976c，第135-136页；1977a，第179-180页；1977b，第2-3, 5-7页）。 赫希工作中的一个重要元素是他讨论了资本主义国家的形式如何影响其再现经济剥削和政治统治双重系统的能力。因为，如果国家要作为一个“理想的集体资本家”来执行这些一般的“经济”职能，它必须抵制反资本主义力量和要求的渗透，还必须确保通过其行动可以确保资本的集体利益。在这个背景下，赫希将国家视为一个形式决定的阶级关系领域，其运作必须满足三个功能性命令：确保经济再生产过程，通过胁迫、让步和意识形态手段维持被统治阶级的从属地位，并制定能够统一主导阶层和阶级为相对一致的权力集团的政策。他还认为，国家干预本质上是反应性的，意味着它倾向于对特定经济事件及其政治反响做出响应，而不是试图完全控制资本循环的每一个环节。鉴于这些复杂的功能性命令和国家干预的反应性质，赫希得出结论，国家既需要多元化的结构，也需要特定的处理机制：前者使各种阶级力量可以提出自己的要求，后者使这些要求可以与资本积累和政治统治的需要相兼容。因此，他根据政治层面上国家对阶级斗争施加的特定形式以及其各个部门、机构和组织的关系中固有的“结构性选择性”来看待国家。然而，尽管这些理论关注点在他的政治分析中始终如一，赫希对国家满足这些需要的能力提出了越来越多的质疑。因此，虽然他早期的工作关注政治系统整体中“结构性选择性”所蕴含的阶级偏见程度，以及这种选择性如何让国家能够制定和实施对资本主义再生产客观上必要但可能损害特定资本即时利益的政策和战略，但他近期的工作着眼于国家试图维持相对无危机的资本积累过程和与持续资产阶级政治统治相兼容的阶级力量配置所涉及的问题。"},{"prompt":"请将“In discussing the class-specific ‘structural selectivity’ of the capitalist state Hirsch refers both to the basic structural constraints which shape the policymaking process as a complex system of decisions and ‘non-decisions’ and to the situational logic which predisposes the governing groups to discriminate in favour of capital.

Yet, although such structural constraints and their complementary situational logic do produce a distinct class bias, they cannot really guarantee that the result of party political struggles and bureaucratic ‘muddling through’ will go beyond a merely particularistic reproduction of conflicting fractional and class interests to secure the economic or political domination of capital as a whole (let alone to harmonies and secure both). Accordingly Hirsch also refers to the important role of crises in steering the activities of the state. He argues that serious failures of market forces and state intervention to reproduce those conditions needed for capital accumulation and/or political domination threaten/ the ‘governing groups’, stimulate demands for action, class forces, and impose new priorities on the state. Thus, while he continues to emphasise the role of the TRPF (including its reflection on the political level in fiscal crises) and its various counter-tendencies in determining the dynamic of capitalist societies, it is the political repercussions of this tendential fall in the rate of profit and its articulation with crises of mass integration and/ or the power bloc which constitute the principal steering mechanism of state intervention and the reorganisation of the political system. But Hirsch also notes that this steering mechanism is not an automatic pilot: instead it is mediated through changes in the balance of class forces (see Hirsch, 1973, pp. 223-225, 265; 1974a, PP. 65, 75-76, 91-92, 103-104; 1974c, pp. 116-117, 126129; 1976a, pp. 129-130, 143-145; 1976b, pp. 116, 123, 127-128; 1977a, pp. 178-180; 1977b; 1978, pp. 225-228; 1980a, pp. 9-53 et seq.; 1980b, pp. 127-13 1; on crises as a steering mechanism, see also: Wirth, 1973, p. 38). These arguments can be illustrated with Joachim Hirsch’s recent analyses of the crisis-induced reorganisation of mass integration in West Germany. Hirsch attributes a key role in bourgeois reproduction to certain mass integrative apparatuses whose function is to process mass needs and make their satisfaction compatible with capital accumulation and political domination. This function depends on the room available for material concessions and, in the advanced metropolitan democracies, is achieved through a reformist mode of mass integration. In West Germany this works through a social democratic cartel of integrated, sozialpartnerschaftlich, economistic trade unions and a bureaucratic, electoralist Volkspartei with the support of the ideological and repressive apparatuses. But the growing structural crises of the economy at home and on the world market and the resulting attempts at rationalisation, increased exploitation, and social modernisation has thrown the reformist mode of mass integration into crisis with the growth of strikes, protest movements, and political disaffection. In response the state has not attempted to smash the mass integrative apparatuses as such but merely to suppress protest movements operating outside them and/or potential subversives within the different mass integrative, ideological, and repressive apparatuses. This permits the reorganisation of the prevailing mode of mass integration through a more selective flow of material concessions at the expense of marginal groups, a more active policy of corporatist integration of responsible unions and parties, and a greater role for the security apparatus within the framework of bourgeois democracy (see Hirsch, 1978; 1980a; 1980b). AN EXCURSUS ON CLAUS OFFE Political economy and political sociology are combined in a different fashion in the work of another influential West German theorist, Claus Offe, who has contributed much, directly and indirectly, to a critique of the state in ‘late capitalism’. Offe has an ambivalent and mediated relationship to orthodox Marxism. His analyses owe as much to the ideas of the Frankfurt School, radical American sociology, systems theory, and the sociology of work as they do to the orthodox Marxist tradition and it is rare for him to present his work as a direct contribution to Marxist theory. It is also worth noting that the seminal contribution to Staatsableitung of Müller and Neusüss was directed against the studies of Habermas and Offe as much as the revisionism of the Second International or postwar social democratic reformism. But it is also clear that Offe has always been deeply concerned with the commodity form of social relations, its political conditions of existence, its articulation with non-commodity forms, the various chronic dilemmas and acute contradictions of late capitalism, the emergent dislocations between the form and functions of the capitalist state, and the transformation of the postwar state. For this reason his analyses have also influenced Marxist state theorists in various countries and schools, most notably for our purposes through the concept of ‘structural selectivity’ appropriated by Hirsch and Poulantzas at certain stages in their work. Thus, in presenting this excursus on the work of Claus Offe, it is not intended to suggest that he is an explicit adherent of the form derivation school nor that he operates more generally within an exclusively Marxist framework. But his contributions are so important that it would be pedantic to exclude them from a discussion of theories concerning the form and/or functions of the capitalist state. Offe first gained critical attention for his analysis of political authority and crisis-management in late capitalism (Offe, 1969) and has since elaborated the central ideas in this analysis in other theoretical and empirical studies. In his early work he criticised both conflict and integration theories of political authority, and instrumentalist and economic determinist accounts of the capitalist state, for their obvious inability to explain the specific mechanisms through which democracies secure the interests of capital as a whole in economic reproduction and political class domination (Offe, 1969, pp. 73-81; 1974, pp. 3 1-36). It is in this context that he introduces the concept of ‘crisis-management’ to account for the role of the state in economic reproduction as well as the concept of ‘structural selectivity’ to account for the class nature of the democratic state. In particular Offe argues that the state must be so structured internally that (a) it can develop a coherent programme corresponding to the interests of capital and not merely one that reflects the competing and contradictory interests of particular capitals and (b) it can systematically exclude the demands and interests of anti-capitalist forces and stop them from disturbing policy-making and implementation (1974, pp. 37-40). But he also notes that the capitalist state cannot effectively play its essential role as an ‘ideal collective capitalist’ (1974, pp. 31, 3 5-36) unless it can conceal its institutionally inscribed class bias behind the cloak of the general interest and democratic legitimation (ibid., pp. 46-54; 1975a, pp. 25ff; 1975b, p. 127; 1976a, pp. 91-97; see also Offe and Ronge, 1975, p. 140). This means that the capitalist state must try to secure both capital accumulation and bourgeois legitimation and, insofar as these involve a strategic dilemma and can result in mutual antagonism, it is also obliged to compensate for any imbalance or conflict between them through appropriate administrative and/or repressive measures.”翻译为中文","completion":"在讨论资本主义国家的阶级特定的“结构性选择性”时，赫希既指出了塑造政策制定过程为一个复杂的决策和“非决策”系统的基本结构性约束，也指出了使管理群体倾向于偏袒资本的情境逻辑。他强调的基本结构性约束包括：(a) 国家通常被排除在资本主义经济的本质上“私有”的生产核心之外；(b) 国家开支依赖于从资本主义经济内创造的总剩余中提取的收入；(c) 由中央行政镇压性国家机构监督意识形态和/或“大众整合”机构，将它们在意识形态再生产和/或利益调解中的角色限制在可管理的范围内；以及(d) 复杂的官僚政策制定过程中，不同的派系或阶级力量通过谈判、使用否决权等方式来促进或捍卫他们的利益。他还论证，负责政治体系的“管理群体”（尤其是官员和政治家）有既得利益，确保资本积累和资产阶级政治统治作为他们自我再生产的基本前提条件。特别是，他们必须考虑到下属阶级的要求，以防止他们作为剩余劳动力的生产者被摧毁，并确保他们的持续群众忠诚；而且必须试图将不同资本派系（或其他主导阶级）的竞争性增值（或类似）利益结合起来，以确保它们作为一个权力集团的相对统一和凝聚力。赫希在这里强调，为了再生产资本关系作为一个增值过程所需的措施，可能与确保资产阶级霸权作为不同阶级力量之间“不稳定的妥协平衡”所需的措施相矛盾（参考格兰西1971年）。他建议，这一矛盾的解决方案可能在于国家的趋势性加强，使其能够在不需要经济破坏性的物质让步的情况下维持政治统治（关于“结构性选择性”，参见赫希，1973年，第263页；1974a，第100-101, 194页；1974c，第90-93, 100-108页；1976a，第135-138页；1976b，第119-121页；关于“管理群体”的情境逻辑，参见：赫希，1974a，第66页；1974c，第118-120页；1976a，第138-141页；1976b，第122-124页；1977a，第166, 172, 178页；关于这两个论点，另见：Offe，1972年，第65-106页，以及Offe和Ronge，1976年，第54-70页；关于“权力集团”（Block an der Macht）和资产阶级霸权，参见赫希，1976a，第109-110, 112, 116-123, 141页；1976b，第104-105, 112-114页；1977a，第166-167, 177-178页；1978年，第224-226页；关于强国家的兴起，参见：赫希，1970年，第242-243, 265-279页；1973年，第264-266页；1974a，第106页；1974c，第125, 130-131页；1976a，第145-146页；1976b，第128-129页；1977a，第180-181页；1978年；1980a；1980b）。 然而，尽管这些结构性约束及其补充的情境逻辑确实产生了明显的阶级偏见，但它们并不能真正保证政党政治斗争和官僚“摸索前进”的结果能超越仅仅是冲突的派系和阶级利益的特定化再生产，以确保资本作为一个整体的经济或政治统治（更不用说协调并确保两者了）。因此，赫希还提到危机在引导国家活动中的重要作用。他认为，市场力量和国家干预未能再生产资本积累和/或政治统治所需条件的严重失败威胁“管理群体”，激发了行动要求，阶级力量，并给国家施加了新的优先级。因此，尽管他继续强调TRPF的作用（包括其在政治层面上以财政危机的形式反映）及其各种逆势力在决定资本主义社会动态中的角色，但正是这种利润率下降趋势及其与大众整合危机和/或权力集团危机的关联，构成了国家干预和政治体制重组的主要引导机制。但赫希也指出，这种引导机制不是自动驾驶仪：相反，它是通过阶级力量平衡的变化而中介的（参见赫希，1973年，第223-225, 265页；1974a，第65, 75-76, 91-92, 103-104页；1974c，第116-117, 126-129页；1976a，第129-130, 143-145页；1976b，第116, 123, 127-128页；1977a，第178-180页；1977b；1978年，第225-228页；1980a，第9-53等；1980b，第127-131页；关于危机作为引导机制，另见：Wirth，1973年，第38页）。 这些论点可以通过乔阿希姆·赫希最近对西德大众整合危机引发的重组进行的分析来说明。赫希将某些大众整合机构在资产阶级再生产中的关键作用归因于其处理大众需求的功能，使其满足与资本积累和政治统治相兼容。这一功能取决于可用于物质让步的空间，并在先进的大都市民主国家中通过改革主义的大众整合模式实现。在西德，这通过一个综合的、赞成社会伙伴关系的、经济主义的工会和官僚的、选举主义的Volkspartei以及意识形态和镇压机构的支持来实现。但国内和世界市场上经济的日益增长的结构性危机以及由此产生的合理化、增加剥削和社会现代化的尝试，使得改革主义的大众整合模式陷入危机，随着罢工、抗议运动和政治不满的增长。作为回应，国家没有试图摧毁大众整合机构本身，而仅仅是压制在它们之外运作的抗议运动和/或在不同的大众整合、意识形态和镇压机构内的潜在颠覆分子。这允许通过牺牲边缘群体的更有选择性的物质让步、对负责任的工会和政党实施更积极的企业集团整合政策，以及在资产阶级民主框架内为安全机构赋予更大的作用，从而对当前的大众整合模式进行重组（参见赫希，1978年；1980a；1980b）。 关于克劳斯·奥菲的附录 克劳斯·奥菲是另一位在西德有影响力的理论家，他以不同的方式结合了政治经济学和政治社会学，直接和间接地为对“后资本主义”时代国家的批判作出了许多贡献。奥菲与正统马克思主义有着复杂和中介的关系。他的分析既借鉴了法兰克福学派、激进的美国社会学、系统理论和工作社会学的思想，也借鉴了正统马克思主义传统，并且很少将他的工作呈现为对马克思理论的直接贡献。值得注意的是，对Staatsableitung的开创性贡献是针对哈贝马斯和奥菲的研究，与对第二国际修正主义或战后社会民主主义改革主义的批评同样重要。但显而易见的是，奥菲一直深切关注社会关系的商品形式，其政治存在条件，其与非商品形式的关联，后资本主义的各种慢性困境和急性矛盾，资本主义国家形式与职能之间的新出现的脱节，以及战后国家的转变。因此，他的分析也影响了不同国家和学派的马克思主义国家理论家，尤其是通过赫希和普朗查斯在他们工作的某些阶段所借鉴的“结构性选择性”概念。因此，在介绍克劳斯·奥菲的工作时，并不意味着他是形式衍生学派的明确追随者，也不意味着他通常在一个纯粹的马克思主义框架内运作。但考虑到他的贡献如此重要，将其排除在对资本主义国家的形式和/或职能的理论讨论之外将是矫揉造作的。 奥菲最初因其对后资本主义时代政治权威和危机管理的分析而引起批评关注（奥菲，1969年），此后在其他理论和实证研究中发展了这一分析的核心思想。在他的早期工作中，他批评了政治权威的冲突和整合理论，以及资本主义国家的工具主义和经济决定论账户，因为它们显然无法解释民主国家通过特定机制确保资本作为一个整体在经济再生产和政治阶级统治中的利益（奥菲，1969年，第73-81页；1974年，第31-36页）。在这个背景下，他引入了“危机管理”概念，以解释国家在经济再生产中的作用，以及“结构性选择性”概念，以解释民主国家的阶级性质。特别是奥菲认为，国家的内部结构必须如此安排，以便(a) 它能够制定与资本利益一致的一致性计划，而不仅仅是反映特定资本的竞争和矛盾利益的计划；并且(b) 它能够系统地排除反资本主义力量的要求和利益，阻止它们干扰政策制定和实施（1974年，第37-40页）。但他还指出，除非资本主义国家能够在一般利益和民主合法化的掩护下隐藏其制度性的阶级偏见（同上，第46-54页；1975a，第25ff页；1975b，第127页；1976a，第91-97页；另见Offe和Ronge，1975年，第140页），否则无法有效地发挥作为“理想的集体资本家”的本质角色（1974年，第31, 35-36页）。这意味着资本主义国家必须努力确保资本积累和资产阶级合法化，并且，因为这些涉及战略性困境并可能导致相互对立，它还必须通过适当的行政和/或镇压措施来补偿它们之间的任何不平衡或冲突。"},{"prompt":"请将“The twofold functional requirement of maintaining both accumulation and legitimation is closely connected with the complex relations between the commodity form and non-commodity forms. Thus Offe argues that the continued dominance of the commodity form which is essential to bourgeois reproduction comes increasingly to depend on the existence of social and political activities and institutions which are not themselves organised through the commodity form and its attendant principle of the exchange of equivalents. In this context he refers to two major contemporary trends. First he notes that there is a continued expansion of non-productive labour which is not readily subordinated, if at all, to the principle of equivalent exchange (notably service labour in the tertiary sector of the economy, whether private or public) and, indeed, also suggests that there is a growing proportion of the population who are marginal to, or wholly excluded from, the labour market. Second he discusses the changing and expanding role of the state as an extra-economic institution in securing not only the general external conditions of production but also in supplying various material factors of production and/or providing welfare services outside the market-regulated economic system. These developments pose a dilemma for capitalism. For, while the commodity form depends increasingly on the expansion of non-commodity forms, their very expansion threatens to undermine both accumulation and legitimation. The dominance of the exchange principle and the growth of accumulation are materially threatened by the expansion of the service sector and the state provision of ‘public goods’ in the mixed economy and welfare state of ‘late capitalism’. This occurs through the growing politicisation of economic relations and the development of alternative criteria for the distribution of usevalue and/or through the emergence of fiscal crises and the parasitic withdrawal of revenue from profitable investment by private capital. At the same time, moreover, the ‘decommodification’ of significant areas of social life threatens the legitimacy of the political system. This can occur through the withdrawal of political support as citizens find themselves unable to exchange their commodities (including labour-power) for equivalent values or prove unwilling to accept market outcomes as legitimate and/or through the growing conflict between the (a) formal unity of the state apparatus that is rooted in its rationallegal legitimation and (b) the material diversity of its discretionary, ad hoc, purposive interventions oriented to specific economic and social goals. (On these crisis-tendencies, see Offe, 1973b, passim; 1973a, pp. 36-44, 47 53, 75-63; 1975a, pp. 9-50 and passim; 1976b, pp. 91-97; 1980, pp. 8-13; Offe and Ronge, 1976, pp. 140-146; see also Ronge, 1974, pp. 86-93). The solutions suggested by Offe for these crisis-tendencies change during the course of his theoretical and empirical enquiries. At first he implied that it would be possible to avoid crises through a judicious combination of structurally selective institutional mechanisms, skilful preventive crisis management to ensure an appropriate balance among the goals of economic stability, foreign economic and military equilibrium, and mass loyalty, and, finally, ‘ideological planning’ to secure popular backing for technocratically determined policies (Offe, 1969, pp. 97-105). It was his suggestions in this context that the state could avoid the escalation of economic crisis-tendencies into economic catastrophe, could displace class conflicts between capital and labour as the main driving force of social change and substitute conflicts between politically favoured and disfavoured interest groups, and could also consolidate mass support for a technocratic political system, that drew the wrath of orthodox Marxist theorists such as Müller and Neusüss (for his cutting response, see Offe, 1975c, passim). Whatever the precise implications of his initial contribution to political economy, his subsequent work is much less equivocal in its assessment of the crisistendencies of late capitalism. For, in a study that owes as much to systems theory as it does to Marxist political economy, Offe stresses that there is an emergent ‘crisis of crisis-management’ in the late capitalist political system. This emergent political crisis can reveal itself in three main areas: a fiscal crisis of the state, a crisis of administrative rationality, and a crisis of mass loyalty. In addition to the specific mechanisms underlying each of these three political crisis-tendencies, Offe identifies a general causal mechanism grounded in the political economy of capitalism. For the state is increasingly obliged to compensate for the failures of the market mechanisms without being able to infringe on the primacy of private production. Yet it cannot adequately compensate for these failures without undermining the dominance of the capital relation through the extension of noncommodity forms of social relation and/or undermining the fiscal, administrative, and legitimatory preconditions of its regulative functions on behalf of capital (Offe, 1973a, pp. 54-64). In this context Offe outlines various responses to the ‘crisis of crisis-management’. Initially he focused on the possibilities of what he descried as the ‘administrative recommodification’ of economic and social life. This involves active state intervention to roll back the expanding frontiers of non-commodity forms of social relations where possible and otherwise to subordinate them firmly to the logic of equivalent exchange. Thus, if the first stage of developed capitalism involved a liberal, laissez-faire state combined with the maximum scope for free competition in the economic region and the second stage involved the growing socialisation and ‘decommodification’ of social and economic life to compensate for the failures of the market mechanism, it is possible to discern a third stage in which the state intervenes to re-establish the dominance of the market mechanism in order to limit its own crisis-tendencies as well as those of the market sector. This can be seen in three main fields of state intervention: measures to enhance the saleability of labour-power through education, retraining, regional mobility, and so on; measures to promote the marketability of capital and manufactured goods through internationalisation of capital and product markets, R and D, regional development policies, etc.; and support for market-generated and crisis-induced industrial restructuring rather than wholesale nationalisation and unconditional protection for ‘lame ducks’. However, whilst these various measures may succeed in certain respects, they may also produce self-defeating effects elsewhere. Thus ‘administrative recommodification’ restricts the formal and substantive freedom of capital and labour and entails fiscal burdens that discourage investment. It also leads to the expansion of state-organised production facilities exempt from the commodityform which can provide the site for political and ideological struggles against market rationality. And the transparent role of the state in the production and distribution of goods and services may also undermine ‘possessive individualism’ as an ideological precondition of the exchange principle (see Offe, 1973 a, passim; 1975 a, passim; and Offe and Ronge, 1976, passim). In other work Claus Offe focuses on the dilemmas and contradictions that occur when the state attempts to compensate for crises of administrative rationality and/or mass loyalty through the introduction of new forms of economic planning and public participation. In this context he distinguishes between two types of state activity: allocative and productive. Allocation involves the use of state resources to secure the general framework of economic activity and/or to provide general public services in accordance with general constitutional or legislative codes which reflect the prevailing balance of political forces. Conversely, production involves direct state provision or state-sponsored provision of material resources as a precondition of crisis-avoidance or crisismanagement where there is no general code that can be applied and decision rules must therefore be developed in order to determine the most effective action case by case. Offe then argues that, although rational-legal bureaucratic administration may be appropriate to the allocative activities of the stat’, it is inadequate to the demands of state productive activities in so far as these are oriented to the attainment of particular objectives rather than the general application of pregiven rules. Thus bureaucracy must be replaced with new modes of policy formation and implementation: purposive action or planning based on technical rationality and/or consensus based on the democratic participation of those affected by the policies and programmes concerned. But, just as bureaucracy has certain limitations as a form of policy formation and implementation, so do purposive action and participation. Purposive action is made difficult by the absence of clear-cut, uncontroversial, and operationalizable goals, the instability of the economic and political environment, the problems encountered by the state in securing acceptance of the social and fiscal costs of effective planning, and so forth. In addition it is likely to provoke avoidance or retaliatory measures from particular capitals when it harms their particular interests. But democratic participation is likely in turn to generate demands that are inconsistent with capital accumulation and will politicise the process of administration. In short, whatever the form of policymaking and implementation adopted in the capitalist state, it could prove ineffective from the viewpoint of capital accumulation and legitimation (Offe, 1975a, pp. 9-50 and passim; Offe, 1975b, passim; Ronge, 1974, passim). Thus, although he started out by arguing that the internal structure of the capitalist state guaranteed the domination of capital, Offe soon arrived at the conclusion that the form of the capitalist state is deeply problematic for accumulation and legitimation alike. This theme is pursued in his recent work with reference to the increasing difficulties that confront the competitive party system and the Keynesian welfare state in securing the conditions for accumulation and legitimation (e.g., Offe, 980, passim; 198lb, passim; 198lc, passim) and with the likely contradictions that would follow from the introduction of functional representation or ‘neo-corporatism’ and/or more far-reaching forms of technocratic decision-making (e.g., Offe, 1980, pp. 9- 11;1981a, pp. 136-141; 198lc, pp. 3-15; Offe and Wiesenthal, 1978, pp. 70-80). In this sense, these studies confirm the argument he advanced earlier: that the basic problem of the capitalist state does not concern the specific policies to be pursued in solving the difficulties thrown up by the process of accumulation but actually resides in the prior creation and institutionalisation of general forms of policymaking and implementation that can reconcile its internal mode of operation with the successful performance of its functions on behalf of capital (Offe, 1975b, pp. 140 and 144). This means that, far from providing a guarantee of the class character of the state as an ‘ideal collective capitalist’, the ‘structural selectivity’ of the state is potentially inimical to the interests of capital without thereby necessarily favouring the subordinated classes or new social movements (cf. Offe, 1978, pp. 28ff). ”翻译为中文","completion":"维持积累和合法性的双重功能需求与商品形态与非商品形态之间的复杂关系密切相关。因此，奥菲认为，商品形式对资产阶级再生产至关重要的持续支配越来越依赖于不通过商品形式及其等价交换原则组织的社会和政治活动及机构的存在。在这个背景下，他指出了两个主要的当代趋势。首先，他注意到非生产性劳动持续扩张，这种劳动不易（如果有的话）被等价交换原则所涵盖（特别是第三产业的服务劳动，无论是私有还是公有），而且实际上还表明人口中有越来越大一部分人处于劳动力市场的边缘或完全被排除在外。其次，他讨论了国家作为一个超经济机构在确保生产的一般外部条件以及在市场调节的经济体系之外提供各种物质生产要素和/或提供福利服务方面的角色变化和扩大。 这些发展为资本主义带来了一个难题。因为，虽然商品形式越来越依赖于非商品形式的扩张，但非商品形式的扩张本身却威胁到积累和合法性。在“后资本主义”的混合经济和福利国家中，服务部门的扩张和国家对“公共物品”的提供通过经济关系的日益政治化和使用价值分配的替代标准的发展，或通过财政危机和从私人资本的有利投资中寄生性提取收入，实质上威胁到交换原则的统治和积累的增长。同时，社会生活的重要领域“非商品化”威胁到政治体系的合法性。这可能通过公民撤回政治支持（因他们发现自己无法以等价值交换自己的商品（包括劳动力）或不愿接受市场结果作为合法）和/或通过(a) 国家机构的形式统一性（植根于其合理-法律合法性）和(b) 其酌情、特设、针对特定经济和社会目标的干预之间不断增长的冲突而发生（关于这些危机趋势，参见奥菲，1973b，各处；1973a，第36-44, 47-53, 75-63页；1975a，第9-50页及各处；1976b，第91-97页；1980年，第8-13页；奥菲和Ronge，1976年，第140-146页；另见Ronge，1974年，第86-93页）。 奥菲对这些危机趋势提出的解决方案在其理论和实证研究过程中发生了变化。起初，他暗示通过明智组合结构性选择性制度机制、熟练的预防性危机管理以确保经济稳定、外经济和军事平衡以及大众忠诚目标之间的适当平衡，以及最后的“意识形态规划”以保障技术决策政策的民众支持，可以避免危机（奥菲，1969年，第97-105页）。正是他在这方面的建议，即国家可以避免经济危机趋势升级为经济灾难，可以将资本和劳动之间的阶级冲突替代为社会变革的主要驱动力，转而将冲突转移到政治上受宠和不受宠的利益集团之间，以及也可以巩固对科技政治体制的大众支持，引起了正统马克思主义理论家如穆勒和诺伊苏斯（Neusüss）的愤怒（针对他的尖锐回应，参见奥菲，1975c，各处）。无论他最初对政治经济学的贡献有什么确切的含义，他随后的工作在评估“后资本主义”的危机趋势时表现得更加明确。奥菲强调，“后资本主义”政治体制中出现了一种“危机管理危机”。这种新出现的政治危机可能在三个主要领域显现：国家的财政危机、行政合理性危机以及大众忠诚危机。除了这三个政治危机趋势各自的特定机制外，奥菲还确定了一个基于资本主义政治经济学的一般性因果机制。因为国家越来越被迫补偿市场机制的失败，而又不能侵犯私有生产的首要地位。然而，它无法在不通过扩展非商品形式的社会关系和/或破坏其代表资本行使监管功能的财政、行政和合法性前提条件的情况下，充分补偿这些失败（奥菲，1973a，第54-64页）。 在这一背景下，奥菲概述了对“危机管理危机”的各种反应。最初，他关注了他所描述的经济和社会生活的“行政性商品化”的可能性。这涉及积极的国家干预，以尽可能回退非商品形式的社会关系扩张的前沿，否则将它们坚定地置于等价交换的逻辑之下。因此，如果发达资本主义的第一阶段涉及自由放任的自由市场国家与经济领域自由竞争的最大范围结合，第二阶段涉及社会经济生活的日益社会化和“非商品化”，以补偿市场机制的失败，可以看出第三阶段中国家干预以重新确立市场机制的统治，以限制自身的危机趋势以及市场部门的危机趋势。这可以在国家干预的三个主要领域看到：通过教育、再培训、区域流动性等措施提高劳动力的可销售性；通过国际化资本和产品市场、研发、区域发展政策等措施促进资本和制成品的市场性；以及支持市场生成和危机诱发的产业重组，而不是全面国有化和无条件保护“瘸腿鸭”。然而，尽管这些措施在某些方面可能取得成功，但它们也可能在其他地方产生适得其反的效果。因此，“行政性商品化”限制了资本和劳动的形式和实质自由，并带来财政负担，从而阻碍投资。它还导致国家组织的生产设施扩张，这些设施免受商品形式的约束，可以为针对市场合理性的政治和意识形态斗争提供场所。国家在商品和服务的生产和分配中的透明角色也可能破坏“占有个人主义”作为交换原则的意识形态前提条件（参见奥菲，1973a，各处；1975a，各处；奥菲和Ronge，1976年，各处）。 在其他工作中，克劳斯·奥菲关注当国家试图通过引入经济规划和公共参与的新形式来补偿行政合理性和/或大众忠诚危机时遇到的困境和矛盾。在这种背景下，他区分了国家活动的两种类型：分配和生产。分配涉及使用国家资源来确保经济活动的一般框架和/或根据反映当前政治力量平衡的一般宪法或立法法典提供一般公共服务。相反，生产涉及国家直接提供或国家赞助提供物质资源作为避免危机或危机管理的前提条件，在这里没有能够应用的一般法典，因此必须制定决策规则，以便根据具体情况确定最有效的行动。奥菲随后论证，虽然合理-法律官僚行政可能适用于国家的分配活动，但就其针对特定目标的达成而言，对国家生产活动的要求是不足的，而不是一般应用预设规则。因此，官僚制必须被基于技术合理性和/或基于所涉及的政策和计划的受影响人民主参与的共识的新模式的政策制定和实施所取代。但是，正如官僚制作为一种政策制定和实施形式有其局限性一样，目的性行动和参与也有。目的性行动因缺乏明确、毫无争议且可操作化的目标，经济和政治环境的不稳定，国家在确保有效规划的社会和财政成本方面的接受问题等而变得困难。此外，当它损害其特定利益时，它可能会引起特定资本的回避或报复性措施。但民主参与可能反过来产生与资本积累不一致的要求，并将行政过程政治化。简而言之，无论在资本主义国家采取什么形式的政策制定和实施，从资本积累和合法性的角度来看，它可能都是无效的（奥菲，1975a，第9-50页及各处；奥菲，1975b，各处；Ronge，1974年，各处）。 因此，虽然他最初认为资本主义国家的内部结构保证了资本的统治，但奥菲很快得出结论，资本主义国家的形式对积累和合法性都是深刻的问题。他的最近作品涉及到竞争政党制度和凯恩斯福利国家在确保积累和合法性条件方面日益增长的困难（例如，奥菲，1980年，各处；1981b，各处；1981c，各处），以及引入功能代表或“新企业主义”和/或更深远的技术决策形式可能带来的矛盾（例如，奥菲，1980年，第9-11页；1981a，第136-141页；1981c，第3-15页；奥菲和维森塔尔，1978年，第70-80页）。从这个意义上说，这些研究确认了他之前提出的论点：资本主义国家的基本问题并不涉及追求特定政策以解决积累过程带来的困难，而实际上在于先行创建和制度化能够调和其内部运作方式与代表资本成功执行其职能的一般政策制定和实施形式（奥菲，1975b，第140和144页）。这意味着，国家作为“理想的集体资本家”的“结构性选择性”远非保证其阶级性质的保障，而是可能对资本的利益构成潜在威胁，而不一定有利于被支配阶级或新的社会运动（参见奥菲，1978年，第28ff页）。"},{"prompt":"请将“STATEHOOD, WORLD MARKET, AND HISTORICAL CONSTITUTION The preceding theories are often formalistic and/or ahistorical in their derivation of the nature and functions of the capitalist state and, indeed, in the case of theories operating at the level of surface forms, have clear voluntarist implications in developing something akin to a ‘social contract’ theory of the state. In contrast to such purely logical derivations of the necessary institutional form of the state in a fully developed capitalist society (i.e., its ‘formal constitution’), other state theorists have argued for the need to examine the historical constitution of the state during the transition from precapitalist to capitalist society. Moreover, whereas the existence of a plurality of nation-states in the capitalist world system is systematically neglected in deriving the formal constitution of the capitalist state at the level of the pure CMP, these theorists also argue that this plurality must be considered as a constitutive feature of the historical development of the capitalist state in an expanding world market and must be considered from the outset of any attempt at derivation. Let us see how such views are developed in the work of West German and British state theorists. In a critique of other theories Heide Gerstenberger argued that the form of the capitalist state had been derived from the fully developed capital relation - yet the state is not simply the result of a bourgeois society but is also its presupposition. Throughout Europe the growth of bourgeois state functions preceded the emergence of the formal structure of the capitalist state (e.g., constitutionalism and universal suffrage). This means that the historical constitution of the bourgeois state as an administrative apparatus performing functions necessary for accumulation is not identical with its formal constitution as a Rechtsstaat imposing particular forms on social relations in bourgeois society. In this context Gerstenberger focuses on the role of the absolutist state pursuing mercantilist policies as an important factor in the development of capitalism and in the rise of the bourgeois form of state. She argues that the development of the administrative structure of the capitalist state is historically rooted in the need for the absolutist state to supplement the activities of merchant capital in conquering foreign markets and in promoting national economic growth. The ability of the state to pursue these interests depended on the creation of a standing army and navy independent of the feudal aristocracy, the development of an orderly monetary system and an efficient system for managing the national debt, the introduction of a modern tax system and an effective bureaucratic apparatus to administer it, and the development of ‘political arithmetic’ and protectionist economic policies. It was in the context of this material constitution of a modern administrative apparatus that the formal constitution of the bourgeois state as a Rechtsstaat occurred with a greater or lesser lag according to various historical circumstances. This involved the exclusion of direct force from social relations and the consolidation of the bourgeois rights of freedom and equality vis-à-vis the absolutist monarchy. At first this process is confined to the sphere of circulation and the state still deploys force to influence the valorisation of particular capitals and to ensure the availability of free wage-labour. But, once the general framework for the selfreproduction of capital through market forces has been secured and the commodification of labour-power is completed, then the establishment of the bourgeois Rechtsstaat can also be fully secured (see Gerstenberger, 1973b, pp. 207, 211-225; cf. idem, 1972, pp. 134-139;and, for an account of the coincidence of material and formal constitution in the growth of the U.S. state, see idem, 1973a, pp. 90-188; Hirsch follows Gerstenberger in distinguishing between material and formal constitution but also argues that the centralisation of the means of political coercion depends in turn on the development of the productive forces, monetary relations, trade, etc. stimulated through the emergence of capitalist relations of production within feudal society, see Hirsch, 1976a, pp. 131-134). Hunno Hochberger develops these arguments more fully in distinguishing two aspects of the capitalist state: its administrative apparatus and its juridico-political form of interaction. He derives the form of interaction (Verkehrsform) from the process of simple commodity circulation between formally free and equal individuals; conversely the administrative apparatus is constituted historically in the course of the primitive accumulation of capital. In contrast to Gerstenberger, who explains historical constitution in terms of the mercantilist policies of the absolutist state in relation to the world market, Hochberger focuses on the administrative implications of creating a free wagelabour force for the home market out of artisans and peasants through state intervention and is less concerned with absolutism as such. In this context Hochberger notes that the administrative apparatus is the institutional expression of the use of coercion as an economic force to separate the direct producers from access to means of subsistence and/or from control over the means of production and he argues that the juridico-political form of interaction evolves as a result of various class struggles within the framework of this apparatus and is finally established after the complete commodification of wage-labour. He illustrates this approach with reference to Marx’s own analysis of the recurrent political cycle of democratisation alternating with authoritarian regimes in nineteenth-century France as the bourgeoisie attempted to employ state power to promote the primitive accumulation of capital against the resistance of the subordinate classes and he concludes that the formal constitution of the French bourgeois state was not completed until early in the twentieth century when a majority of the working population had been proletarianised (Hochberger, 1974., pp. 174-177, 185-187, 190-201). Both these studies insist that the historical constitution of the bourgeois state must be related to the development of the capitalist world market. Claudia von Braunmühl takes this approach further. She argues that the world market was the necessary base for primitive accumulation and has since become an increasingly significant base for the organisation of production as well as the circulation of commodity and money capital. The development of this world market is certainly mediated through competition among capitals but it is more than the sum of individual (or, indeed, national) capitals to the extent that it comprises the level of capital in general and its laws of motion. In the competitive struggle for profits in the world market particular capitals will use any available means to promote their interests: this includes the appropriation of existing state apparatuses and their reorganisation to secure the conditions necessary for valorisation and realisation. Initially this leads to the crystallisation of multiple centres of accumulation organised around nation-states and thereafter these nation-states are involved in the contradictory economic cross-currents of internationalisation and nationalisation of the circuit(s) of capital. Accordingly von Braunmühl concludes that it is only in the context of the developing world market that one can analyze the growth of the nation-state and its specific functions in capital accumulation (see von Braunmühl, 1978, pp. 162-177; cf. idem, 1973, pp. 12-13, 32-35, 42-45, 5052, 64-65, 68-69, 90-91; and idem, 1974, pp. 35-51). Similar arguments have been developed in Britain by Cohn Barker. He insists that an analysis of the bourgeois form of state must start from capital in general at the level of the world market. Thus, just as capitalism comprises a world system of competing capitals in the economic sphere, in the political sphere it comprises an international community of nation-states. Likewise, just as capital in general forms a contradictory unity of anarchy (competition among particular capitals) and despotism (control exercised within each individual capital), so the international political community entails a contradictory unity of despotism (sovereignty within each nation-state) and anarchy (competition among nationstates). The actual historical constitution of these nation-states is irrelevant to Barker’s argument. What matters is that each separate nation-state represents the fusion of a particular segment of world capital and other classes into a nation formed in opposition to other nations and in competition with them. Accordingly the capitalist state should not be seen as a purely despotic organ of domination over subordinate classes within the nation but should also be considered as a means of intra-capitalist competition on the world market. Barker also notes here that the state will be subject to the contradictions created through the tendential internationalisation of capital and the counter-tendential formation of a national capital organised around an extensive system of political interventions with productive state capital at its core. In conclusion he discusses the limitations on state intervention at the national level due to the fact that the laws of motion or capital operate through the world market and cannot be suspended on the command of one nation-state (see Barker, 1978a, pp. 120-124, and 1978b, pp. 24-3 7; for a useful critique, see Williams, 1979, pp. 67-70). In developing such arguments about the historical constitution of a plurality of nation-states within the context of an aboriginal world market these studies highlight the important fact that the capitalist state develops on the basis of the pre-capitalist state. Yet many other attempts at ‘Staatsableitung’ appear to assume that, in establishing the particularisation of the bourgeois form of state, they are deriving the necessity of the state as such. Yet this is to confuse the form of the state corresponding to a particular mode of production with the need for some form of extra-economic coercion in any class-divided society regardless of its specific form of appropriation of surplus-labour. In this context some theorists have emphasised the analytical priority of deriving the general need for a political form of social reproduction in class-divided societies before attempting to derive its particular form and/or necessary functional capacities at the level of particular modes of production. This procedure is implied in Hirsch’s distinction between the basic reasons for the existence of class coercion (Existenzgrund) and the factors determining the changing forms of that coercion (see Hirsch, 1976a, pp. 103-106; cf. 1976b, pp. 104-107) but is theorised more explicitly in the work of Schütte and Classen in terms of a distinction between statehood (Staatlichkeit) or ‘state as form’ (‘Staat als Form’), on the one hand, and, on the other hand, specific state forms (Staatsformen) corresponding to distinct modes of production. They also distinguish among specific types of regime (Staatstypen or Herrschaftsformen) in terms of the precise institutional structures and functions of a given state form in actual societies. Let us see how they derive the basic necessity of statehood or the ‘state as form’. ”翻译为中文","completion":"国家性、世界市场与历史构成 前述理论在推导资本主义国家的性质和功能时，往往是形式主义的和/或非历史性的，实际上，在表层形式层面运作的理论中，有发展类似于“社会契约”国家论的明显自愿主义含义。与这种对发达资本主义社会中国家必要制度形式（即其“形式宪法”）的纯逻辑推导不同，其他国家理论家主张需要考察国家在从前资本主义社会向资本主义社会过渡期间的历史构成。此外，尽管在纯粹的CMP水平上推导资本主义国家的形式宪法时，资本主义世界体系中多个民族国家的存在被系统地忽略了，这些理论家还主张，这种多样性必须被视为资本主义国家在不断扩大的世界市场中的历史发展的一个构成特征，并且必须从任何推导尝试的一开始就加以考虑。让我们看看西德和英国的国家理论家是如何发展这些观点的。 在对其他理论的批评中，海德·格斯滕贝格尔（Heide Gerstenberger）认为，已从完全发展的资本关系中推导出资本主义国家的形式——然而，国家不仅仅是资产阶级社会的结果，也是其前提。在整个欧洲，资产阶级国家职能的增长先于资本主义国家的正式结构的出现（例如，宪政制度和普选权）。这意味着，资产阶级国家作为一个执行积累所必需职能的行政机构的历史构成，与其作为Rechtsstaat在资产阶级社会中对社会关系施加特定形式的形式宪法不同。在这种背景下，格斯滕贝格尔关注实行重商主义政策的绝对主义国家在资本主义发展和资产阶级国家形式兴起中的作用。她认为，资本主义国家的行政结构的发展历史上植根于绝对主义国家补充商人资本征服外国市场和促进国家经济增长的需求。国家追求这些利益的能力取决于建立一个独立于封建贵族的常备军和海军，发展有序的货币体系和高效的国家债务管理体系，引入现代税收制度和有效的官僚机构来管理它，以及发展“政治算术”和保护主义经济政策。正是在这种现代行政装置的物质构成背景下，资产阶级国家作为Rechtsstaat的正式构成发生了，根据不同的历史环境，或多或少地存在滞后。这涉及到从社会关系中排除直接武力的使用，并巩固了相对于绝对主义君主制的资产阶级自由和平等权利。起初这一过程仅限于流通领域，国家仍使用武力来影响特定资本的增值和确保自由工资劳动的可用性。但是，一旦通过市场力量自我再生产的资本的一般框架得到保障并且劳动力商品化完成，则资产阶级Rechtsstaat的建立也可以完全得到保障（参见格斯滕贝格尔，1973b，第207, 211-225页；参照同上，1972年，第134-139页；关于美国国家成长中物质和形式宪法的相合，参见同上，1973a，第90-188页；赫希跟随格斯滕贝格尔区分物质和形式宪法，但也争论说政治胁迫手段的集中化反过来取决于通过封建社会内部资本主义生产关系的出现所刺激的生产力、货币关系、贸易等的发展，参见赫希，1976a，第131-134页）。 亨诺·霍赫贝格尔（Hunno Hochberger）更全面地发展了这些论点，区分了资本主义国家的两个方面：其行政机构和其法律-政治互动形式。他从正式自由平等个体之间简单商品流通过程中推导出互动形式（Verkehrsform）；相反，行政机构在资本原始积累过程中历史上形成。与格斯滕贝格尔不同，后者从绝对主义国家与世界市场关系的重商主义政策中解释历史构成，霍赫贝格尔关注通过国家干预将手工艺人和农民转变为自由工资劳动力以供国内市场使用的行政含义，对绝对主义本身关注较少。在这个背景下，霍赫贝格尔指出，行政机构是将胁迫作为经济力量使用以将直接生产者与生存手段和/或生产手段的控制分离开来的制度表达，他认为，法律-政治互动形式作为这一装置框架内各种阶级斗争的结果而演化，并在工资劳动商品化完全之后最终确立。他以马克思对19世纪法国民主化与威权政权交替政治周期的分析为例，说明了资产阶级试图利用国家力量促进资本的原始积累以对抗下属阶级的抵抗，他得出结论，直到20世纪初大部分工人阶级被无产阶级化后，法国资产阶级国家的正式构成才得以完成（霍赫贝格尔，1974年，第174-177, 185-187, 190-201页）。 这些研究坚持认为，资产阶级国家的历史构成必须与资本主义世界市场的发展联系起来。克劳迪娅·冯·布劳姆 (Claudia von Braunmühl) 进一步采取了这种方法。她认为，世界市场是原始积累的必要基础，并且此后成为组织生产以及商品和货币资本流通的日益重要的基础。世界市场的发展当然是通过资本之间的竞争来中介的，但它不仅仅是个体（或确实是国家）资本的总和，因为它构成了一般资本及其运动规律的层面。在世界市场上争夺利润的竞争斗争中，特定资本将使用任何可用手段来促进它们的利益：这包括占有现有国家机构并重新组织它们以确保增值和实现所需的条件。最初这导致了多个以民族国家为中心的积累中心的形成，此后这些民族国家卷入了国际化和资本国家化的矛盾经济潮流中。因此，冯·布劳姆得出结论，只有在发展中的世界市场的背景下，才能分析民族国家的增长及其在资本积累中的特定职能（参见冯·布劳姆，1978年，第162-177页；参照同上，1973年，第12-13, 32-35, 42-45, 50-52, 64-65, 68-69, 90-91页；以及同上，1974年，第35-51页）。 在英国，科恩·巴克尔（Cohn Barker）发展了类似的论点。他坚持认为，对资产阶级国家形式的分析必须从世界市场层面的一般资本入手。因此，正如资本主义在经济领域构成一个竞争资本的世界体系，在政治领域，它构成一个民族国家的国际社区。同样，正如一般资本构成了竞争（特定资本之间的竞争）和专制（在每个个体资本内部的控制）的矛盾统一体，国际政治社区也涉及专制（每个民族国家内部的主权）和无政府状态（民族国家之间的竞争）的矛盾统一体。这些民族国家的实际历史构成对巴克尔的论点并不重要。重要的是每个独立的民族国家代表世界资本的一个特定部分和其他阶级融合成一个与其他国家形成对立并与之竞争的民族。因此，资本主义国家不应仅被视为对国内下属阶级的纯粹专制统治工具，也应被视为在世界市场上进行资本家内部竞争的手段。巴克尔还指出，国家将受到资本国际化趋势和围绕广泛的政治干预体系以生产性国家资本为核心形成的国家资本的反趋势形成所创造的矛盾的影响。最后，他讨论了由于资本的运动规律通过世界市场运作，不能在一个民族国家的命令下被暂停，因此国家在国家层面上的干预受到的限制（参见巴克尔，1978a，第120-124页，和1978b，第24-37页；有关有益的批评，请参阅威廉姆斯，1979年，第67-70页）。 通过在原始世界市场背景下发展关于多个民族国家的历史构成的这些论点，这些研究强调了资本主义国家是在前资本主义国家的基础上发展起来的重要事实。然而，许多其他的“Staatsableitung”尝试似乎假设，通过建立资产阶级国家形式的特定化，他们就推导出国家本身的必要性。然而，这是将一种与特定生产方式相对应的国家形式与任何阶级分化社会中对某种形式的额外经济胁迫的需要混为一谈，不管其特定的剩余劳动挪用形式是什么。在这个背景下，一些理论家强调了在企图推导出特定生产模式的特定形式和/或必要功能级别的国家之前，首先推导出阶级分化社会中社会再生产的政治形式的一般需要的分析优先权。这一程序在赫希区分类胁迫存在的基本原因（Existenzgrund）和决定那种胁迫变化形式的因素中得到了暗示（参见赫希，1976a，第103-106页；参照1976b，第104-107页），但在舒特和克拉森的工作中，他们区分了国家性（Staatlichkeit）或“国家作为形式”（“Staat als Form”）和对应于不同生产方式的特定国家形式（Staatsformen）之间的更明确的理论化。他们还根据给定国家形式在实际社会中的具体制度结构和职能区分了特定类型的体制（Staatstypen或Herrschaftsformen）。让我们看看他们是如何推导国家性或“国家作为形式”的基本必要性的。"},{"prompt":"请将“Schütte and Classen both follow Engels in explaining the need for the state in terms of the division of society into antagonistic classes but their derivations are far from identical. Thus, whereas Classen proceeds from the formal necessity for the state to control the permanent threat of open class conflict between propertied and propertyless and to regulate the conflicts among the propertied themselves, Schütte starts from the historical constitution of the state with the original alienation of political functions in the social division of labour from communal control. Moreover, whereas Classen then considers the general form of the state as a relation of class domination and emphasises that it must combine the use of repression with ideological and integrative activities, it is the changing patterns of articulation between the economic and political forms of social reproduction in class societies that interest Schütte. In this context Schütte distinguishes between the substantive doubling of reproduction in class-divided societies into economic and political processes and its formal doubling within bourgeois societies into the institutional forms of society and state. The substantive doubling of reproduction is traced to the separation of coercive functions from communal control owing to their takeover by an emergent exploiting class and/or their usurpation by an independent officialdom as occurred in Oriental despotism. The formal doubling of reproduction must await the emergence of a mode of production mediated through formally free and equal exchange and thus no longer dependent on the immediate use of extra-economic compulsion in the appropriation of surplus-labour. Here Schütte points to certain elements of a formal doubling in Greek and Roman antiquity but argues that it cannot be completely realised until the commodification of labour-power is achieved. In contrast Classen argues that bourgeois society, despite its apparent foundation in the freedom and equality of exchange relations among its members, needs a state because it is still based on class exploitation. For, should the tendentially self-reproducing mechanisms of the market and/or the forms of false consciousness rooted in commodity circulation break down and reveal the fundamental antagonism between capital and wage-labour, then coercion will be required to maintain bourgeois rule. Only when the necessity of the state as a relation of coercion has been established, argues Classen, can one ask why it takes the form of an impersonal public authority. His own answer to the question is pitched in terms of the need for the bourgeois state to transcend the level of competing capitals and secure the interests of capital in general (see Schütte, 1977a, pp. 541-543, and idem, 1977b, pp. 14-30; Classen, 1979, pp. 51-63 and 249-262; and, for another account of the prefiguration of the formal doubling of state and society in antiquity, Müller, 1975). SUBSTANTIVE CRITIQUE There is clearly wide variation in the approaches adopted in this debate concerning the most appropriate starting point for deriving the form(s) and/or function(s) of the capitalist state. Moreover, while some have remained relatively undeveloped and, in certain cases, have even been disavowed by their original proponents, others have experienced considerable sophistication and elaboration. This further complicates the task of criticism and suggests the need to concentrate on the most advanced representatives of each approach. Thus my comments do not follow the exact order of presentation above but proceed instead according to how problematic the theories see the functioning of the capitalist state. For, although all the theories considered above deal with the necessary and/or contingent functions of the state, not all are equally concerned with the extent and manner in which its basic form and organisation renders these functions contradictory and ineffective. Accordingly theories that problematise the functioning of the state are discussed only after those that takes its functionality more or less for granted. This latter approach is most apparent in the work of Altvater, Aumeeruddy et al., and Clarke. Thus Altvater confined himself to some problems of state intervention rather than aiming at a full-blown derivation of both form and functions; and he tends to take the existence of the state as an ideal collective capitalist for granted and merely lists four functions which the state must fulfil in this role. Likewise, although respectively they privilege one function (maintaining the wage-relation) and discuss functions in a generalised manner, Aumeeruddy et al. and Clarke also treat its functionality as broadly unproblematic. All three studies locate the limitations on the state’s functions in the nature of capital in general as a valorisation process rather than in the form of the state itself. Nor is there any attempt to specify this form beyond positing the particularisation of the state as a distinct moment in the self-reproduction of capital (as a whole or as variable capital) or to explain how the state is able to act as an ideal collective capitalist beyond a purely gestural and inadequate invocation of class struggle as the means of imposing the collective interests of capital. Läpple has attempted to advance on this approach in several respects. Thus, as well as offering a more rigorous account of the so-called general conditions of production and introducing an historical postulate about the worsening contradiction between the material preconditions and the valorisation requirements of capital accumulation, he also locates the functions of the state in terms of its form as a Rechtsstaat and considers how this imposes legal limits on valorisation and also causes sui generis legitimation problems as the state is forced to break these limits to sustain accumulation (Läpple, 1975b, pp. 114-134, 144-158). A further advance is recorded by Sauer in his attempt to avoid economism through introducing the mediating categories of ‘social problems’ and ‘state strategies’ as well as those of competition and exchange and in his emphasis on the form-determined limitations of state intervention. Particularly interesting is his argument that economic deficits must be represented as social problems and that particular interests must be articulated with the general interest. But, despite these innovations, Sauer has not developed the concepts needed to break radically with the residual economism evident in his continuing assumption that social problems are ultimately economic in origin and the class reductionism evident in his account of social forces. Paradoxically it is the work of Elmar Altvater himself that has broken most sharply with the reductionist implications of his early essay on state intervention (Altvater 1972). Thus, in subsequent studies of the West German and Italian states, he introduces various arguments that radically qualify his initial position. Thus, not only does he now include the form of the state (as nation-state, taxstate, and democratic state) and its means of intervention (law, money) among the limits on its functional capacities (Altvater et al., 1976, pp. 100-113), he also argues that class struggles can restrict the state’s room for manoeuvre on behalf of capital and rejects the view that all state measures can be derived from an objectively necessary ‘logic of capital’ (ibid., pp. 110-111, 113). Moreover, while his work on the German state is concerned with the differential effects of fascism, the ‘CDU-Staat’ of Adenauer, and the social democratic regime, he also cites recent studies in arguing that the Italian state has been so deformed through the pressure of individual capitals and the operation of Christian democratic clientelism that it cannot function effectively as an ideal collective capitalist (Altvater et al., 1974a, pp. 55-149; cf. Altvater et al., 1974b, pp. 5-23; and, on the Italian state, Altvater, 1976, pp. 74-75ff, and Genth and Altvater, 1976, pp. 87-89). The latter conclusion suggests that the particularisation of the state is far from a structurally pre-given feature of capitalist societies but rather a feature that must be constantly reproduced in and through political practice (cf. Holloway and Picciotto, 1977, pp. 80-81, 97). Indeed Genth and Altvater themselves argue that analyses of the bourgeois state must go beyond economism and ‘Ableiterei’ (obsessive concern with derivation) to study the historically specific forms and content of ‘societal isation’ (i.e., modes of articulating social relations to create a relative unity in a social formation) and the role in such ‘societal isation’ of the political, cultural, and moral leadership exercised by the bourgeoisie through various political and cultural centres (Genth and Altvater, 1976, pp. 94-97; cf. Altvater and Kallscheuer, 1979, pp. 103-104). And, in this context, they suggest that diverse class and popular-democratic struggles in Italy have precipitated a crisis of hegemony and a veritable societal crisis and conclude that the working class must respond with its own hegemonial strategy embracing other classes and non-class subjects (Genth and Altvater, 1976, pp. 93-108; cf. Altvater and Kallscheuer, 1979, pp. 105, 125-127). This shift in theoretical strategy has obviously been influenced by the work of Gramsci and the political experiences of the PCI but, in contrast to much neo-Gramscian theorising, it remains firmly attached to value-analysis of the economy and tries to combine Gramscian political concepts with form-determination in its analyses of the state.”翻译为中文","completion":"舒特和克拉森都遵循恩格斯的观点，根据社会分裂为对立阶级的需要解释国家的存在，但他们的推导远非一致。因此，克拉森从国家控制财产所有者和无产者之间持久的公开阶级冲突的威胁以及调节财产所有者内部冲突的形式必要性出发，而舒特则从原始政治职能在社会劳动分工中从公共控制中异化的国家历史构成出发。此外，克拉森认为国家的一般形式是阶级统治关系，并强调它必须结合使用镇压与意识形态和整合活动，而舒特则对阶级社会中经济和政治形式的社会再生产之间变化的关联模式感兴趣。在这个背景下，舒特区分了阶级分化社会中的再生产实质上分为经济和政治过程，以及在资产阶级社会中形式上分为社会和国家的制度形式的双重性。再生产的实质双重性追溯到由于新兴剥削阶级的接管以及独立官僚的篡夺（如东方专制制度中发生的情况）导致强制功能与公共控制分离。正式双重性的再生产必须等待通过形式上自由平等的交换调解的生产方式的出现，因此不再依赖于在剩余劳动力挪用中立即使用额外经济强制。舒特指出希腊和罗马古代存在某些正式双重性的元素，但认为直到劳动力商品化实现之前，它无法完全实现。相比之下，克拉森认为，尽管资产阶级社会表面上建立在其成员之间的交换关系的自由和平等基础之上，但仍然需要国家，因为它仍然基于阶级剥削。因为，如果市场的趋势性自我再生产机制和/或根植于商品流通的虚假意识形态形式崩溃，并揭示了资本与工资劳动之间的根本对立，那么将需要强制手段来维持资产阶级统治。克拉森认为，只有在建立了国家作为一种强制关系的必要性之后，才能询问它为何采取非人格公共权威的形式。他自己对这一问题的回答是需要资产阶级国家超越竞争资本的水平，并确保一般资本的利益（参见舒特，1977a，第541-543页，以及同上，1977b，第14-30页; 克拉森，1979年，第51-63和249-262页; 以及关于古代国家与社会正式双重性的预示的另一种描述，参见穆勒，1975年）。 实质性批评 关于最适当的起点用以推导资本主义国家的形式和/或功能的争论中，明显存在广泛的方法论变化。此外，尽管一些理论相对未得到充分发展，在某些情况下甚至被其原始提出者否认，但其他理论则经历了相当大的改进和阐述。这进一步复杂化了批评的任务，表明需要集中讨论每种方法中最先进的代表。因此，我的评论并不遵循上述的准确顺序，而是根据理论认为资本主义国家的功能如何成问题来进行。因为，虽然上述所有理论都涉及到国家的必要和/或偶然职能，但并非所有理论都同样关注其基本形式和组织方式如何使这些功能矛盾和无效。因此，仅在讨论那些把国家的功能性视为理所当然的理论之后，才讨论那些问题化国家功能的理论。 这种后一种方法在阿尔特瓦特（Altvater）、奥梅鲁迪（Aumeeruddy）等人和克拉克（Clarke）的工作中最为明显。因此，阿尔特瓦特将自己局限于一些国家干预的问题，而不是旨在全面推导国家的形式和功能；他倾向于将国家作为理想的集体资本家的存在视为理所当然，并只列出国家在此角色中必须履行的四个职能。同样，尽管分别强调一个职能（维护工资关系）和以一般方式讨论职能，奥梅鲁迪等人和克拉克也将其功能性视为基本无问题。所有三项研究都将国家职能的局限性定位于一般资本作为增值过程的本质中，而不是国家的形式本身。也没有任何尝试将这种形式具体化，除了假设国家作为资本整体或作为可变资本的一个特定时刻的特定化，或解释国家如何能够作为理想的集体资本家，除了纯粹姿态性的和不充分的调用阶级斗争作为强加资本集体利益的手段之外。拉普勒（Läpple）试图在几个方面对这种方法进行改进。因此，除了提供所谓的生产一般条件的更严格账户，并引入一个关于资本积累的物质前提条件与增值要求之间矛盾加剧的历史假设外，他还根据国家作为Rechtsstaat的形式定位其职能，并考虑这如何对增值施加法律限制，以及当国家被迫打破这些限制以维持积累时会导致特有的合法性问题（Läpple，1975b，第114-134, 144-158页）。萨尔（Sauer）试图通过引入“社会问题”和“国家战略”以及竞争和交换的中介范畴，并强调国家干预的形式决定的局限性来避免经济主义。特别有趣的是他的论点，即经济赤字必须被表述为社会问题，而特定利益必须与一般利益相联系。但是，尽管有这些创新，萨尔并未发展出打破其继续假设社会问题根本上是经济起源的残余经济主义和在其社会力量描述中明显的阶级简化论所需的概念。 奇怪的是，正是艾尔马·阿尔特瓦特（Elmar Altvater）自己的工作与他早期关于国家干预的简约论文的简化含义最为截然不同（Altvater 1972）。因此，在关于西德和意大利国家的后续研究中，他引入了各种论点，从根本上修正了他最初的立场。因此，他不仅将国家的形式（作为民族国家、税收国家和民主国家）和其干预手段（法律、金钱）列为其功能能力的限制因素（Altvater等，1976年，第100-113页），他还认为阶级斗争可以限制国家代表资本利益的行动空间，并拒绝所有国家措施都可以从客观必要的“资本逻辑”中推导出的观点（同上，第110-111, 113页）。此外，虽然他对德国国家的研究关注于法西斯主义、“阿登纳的基民盟国家”和社会民主政权的差异效应，但他还引用了最近的研究，认为意大利国家受到个别资本的压力和基督教民主党的裙带关系的运作如此扭曲，以致无法有效地作为理想的集体资本家（Altvater等，1974a，第55-149页；参见Altvater等，1974b，第5-23页；关于意大利国家，参见Altvater，1976年，第74-75ff页，以及Genth和Altvater，1976年，第87-89页）。后者的结论表明，国家的特定化远非资本主义社会的结构先决特征，而是一个特征，必须在政治实践中不断再生产（参见Holloway和Picciotto，1977年，第80-81, 97页）。事实上，Genth和Altvater自己认为，对资产阶级国家的分析必须超越经济主义和“过分关注推导”的“Ableiterei”，研究特定历史形式和内容的“社会化”（即，将社会关系以创造社会形态中的相对统一的方式进行构建）的模式，以及资产阶级通过各种政治和文化中心行使的政治、文化和道德领导在这种“社会化”中的作用(Genth和Altvater，1976年，第94-97页；参见Altvater和Kallscheuer，1979年，第103-104页）。在这个背景下，他们建议，意大利的多样化阶级和大众民主斗争引发了霸权危机和真正的社会危机，得出结论工人阶级必须采取自己的霸权战略，包含其他阶级和非阶级主体(Genth和Altvater，1976年，第93-108页；参见Altvater和Kallscheuer，1979年，第105, 125-127页)。这种理论策略的转变显然受到了格兰西的工作和意大利共产党(PCI)的政治经验的影响，但与许多新格兰西主义理论相比，它仍然紧密依托于对经济的价值分析，并试图将格兰西的政治概念与形式决定相结合，以分析国家。"},{"prompt":"请将“The approach to Staatsableitung through ‘Oberfläche ’ or surface forms seems far removed from the more functionalist approach represented by the early work of Altvater. For, whereas the productivist perspective seems to ignore the specific form of the capitalist state in favour of its functionality for capital, surface form theories emphasise the problem of form. And, whereas the productivist perspective tries to derive state functions from the most abstract levels of the movement of capital, surface form theories emphasise its immediate forms of appearance. Yet, despite this seeming polarisation between the two approaches, there is a fundamental coincidence and theoretical complicity between them. For, whereas the early Altvater argues that the state must act as though it were an ideal collective capitalist and immediately thereafter introduces its four key functions, surface form theorists argue that the state appears as the representative of the common interests and/or general will of those in capitalist society and then proceed to argue that valorisation and/or reproduction problems ultimately determine which particular interests are represented as being in the general interest. Indeed it is only through the latter argument that surface form theorists could avoid the charge of tautology or circularity in suggesting that the state administers general interests and that general interests are precisely those administered by the state. For they have no proof that the state enjoys privileged knowledge of the general interest and also argue that the pluralistic interplay of political forces alone is insufficient to determine the general interest. In this context it is difficult to see how surface form theorists could then avoid the alternative charge that the concept of the state as representative of the ‘general interest’ is superfluous or redundant in explaining the development of its functions on behalf of capital and! or that they are operating with the inadequate method of ‘subsumption’ rather than derivation in equating all state functions with the general interest or its three instances. Hence both the productivist and surface form approaches take the functionality of the state for granted and essentialise its form as an adequate expression of this functionality. (The charge of tautology has been levelled by Blanke, Jürgens, and Kastendiek, 1974, p. 200; and that of redundancy by Reichelt, 1974a, pp. 44-45, who also develops other lines of attack.) In fact it would seem that surface form theorists have conflated the separate problems of explaining the development of state functions and explaining the legitimacy of the state. Even in relation to the latter problem, however, this approach is inadequate. Not only does it overlook the crucial distinction between the historical and the formal constitution of the capitalist state and its implications for the development of the bourgeois democratic republic as the institutional embodiment of the general will, it also tends to ignore the brute fact that the modern state does not always have a bourgeois democratic form. Furthermore, to the extent that they do realise this and have not merely hypostatised false consciousness as an essential trait of the capitalist state, surface form theorists fall back on the equally essentialist view that the state is basically an organ of repression and will use force to maintain bourgeois domination whenever false consciousness is dissolved. This inability to explain either the form or the functions of the state does not mean that these theories are completely without merit. For they do at least include the need for appropriate forms of ideological awareness among the various preconditions of capitalist reproduction and thereby reject the view that false consciousness is an automatic, epiphenomenal effect of exchange relations and is somehow reducible to commodity fetishism. Unfortunately this is vitiated by the failure to develop appropriate concepts for examining the differential articulation of particular and general interests and the reduction of these interests to the issue of economic reproduction for different revenue categories. So far I have argued that neither the productivist approach with its focus on the most abstract determinations of the CMP nor the surface forms approach with its concern for the necessary forms of appearance of the CMP is adequate to the analysis of the capitalist state. For both approaches are marred irredeemably by essentialism and functionalism due to their reduction of the form of the state to an essential expression of certain functional needs in the self-reproduction of capitalism. In one case, these are the valorisation needs of competing capitals, in the other, it is the need to reproduce appropriate phenomenal forms. To what extent are these problems avoided by approaches which start at intermediate levels of abstraction and argue that there can be no form-determined guarantees concerning the functionality of the state in capitalist reproduction? It was noted above that commodity circulation has a role in the circuit of capital as well as in simple commodity production. Yet it is often suggested that studies beginning from commodity circulation cannot explain the specificity of the bourgeois state and legal order. These arguments ignore the fact that labourpower enters the circuit of capital as a simple commodity (cf. Aumeeruddy et al., 1978) - although others would say that it is a fictitious commodity - and that law and money mediate the exchange of labour-power against capital as well as the circulation of capitalist commodities. They also presuppose that such legal and state forms have an immutable bourgeois essence and cannot exist outside the pure CMP. Yet it is most important to distinguish between these forms and their changing functions indifferent contexts. Thus, while it might be argued that law and the state only attain their full development with their institutional separation from the economic region and the associated legal mediation of exploitation through the exchange of wage-labour with capital, this does not mean that they have no pre-history, cannot survive beyond capitalism, and cannot have non-capitalist functions. It is worth recalling here the distinction between the material and formal constitution of the capitalist state and extending it to the legal sphere. The distinction drawn by Tuschling between the cell-form of law (the legal subject as bearer of rights) and the legal order typical of bourgeois societies (the individual legal subject, private property, freedom and equality, rule of law, state monopoly over force) could also be used to refine the materialformal couplet and to establish the specificity of the bourgeois forms of law and the state (cf. Tuschling, 1976, pp. 93-94; 1977, p. 278). We should also note how legal and state functions are overdetermined by the commodification of labourpower and its substantive inversion of the formal freedom and equality of legal relations in the economic and political spheres (cf. Blanke et al., 1974, pp. 110111, 125-129; Picciotto, 1979, p. 170; Tuschling, 1976, pp. 20-39; idem, 1977, p. 270). In short, though the starting point for these analyses of the capitalist state is commodity circulation, it does not follow that they are unable to theories its form and functions in relation to capitalist production and the circuit of capital as a whole. Besides allowing for the commodification of labour-power and taking account of the overall movement of capital, this approach has progressed beyond the early Pashukanis in other ways. This is most evident in its concern with the role of law in the mystification of class relations and the individuation of social forces and with the inherent limitations of the legal form as a means of state intervention. In focusing on the abstract, universal legal subject, however, it suffers from an unfortunate formalism. Thus it neglects the differential effectivity of different categories of legal subject and/or different modes of legal reasoning and it also ignores the problem of how they are articulated with non-legal subjects and/or non-legal discourses. Likewise, in noting how the bourgeois state and law abstract from class relations in constituting the state as an impersonal public power and establishing the abstract, universal legal subject, it also fails to consider how the state is constituted as a class power and how the substantive content of law is adapted to the needs of capital. For to argue that the simple maintenance of the rechtsstaatlich political form and the rule of law are sufficient guarantees of bourgeois reproduction would be to essentialise these forms and to imply that, once the necessary juridico-political framework has been established, economic forces alone can ensure the expanded reproduction of capital. While the disorganisation of subordinate classes may prove beneficial to capital, it is certainly crucial for the bourgeoisie to develop some cohesion in its capacity as the dominant class. Indeed Pashukanis himself notes that the unity of private and public law is historically constituted, largely formal, inherently contradictory, and particularly unstable (Pashukanis, 1929, pp. 47, 60, 96, 101— 106, 137-138, 167, 176-177);and these problems are just as characteristic of other aspects of the state apparatus and state power. Thus Blanke et al. observe that the various policies pursued by the state have only a formal unity (1974, p. 138; 1975, p. 94), Tuschling notes that the mediation of economic imperatives through legal forms entails a certain indeterminacy in policies and their effects (1976, pp. 100-111), and Picciotto points to the ‘porosity’ of bourgeois law and the scope this offers for the exercise of economic and social power in determining juridical outcomes (1979, p. 175). In this context gestural references to the role of class struggle in filling out these indeterminacies are particularly inadequate because these very theories insist that rechtsstaatlich and legal forms disorganise class struggles. Nor does the ritual invocation of class struggle suffice to explain how the interests of capital in general can be secured through these forms. Even if this failing could be overlooked in relation to the purely liberal moment of the state as the passive guarantor of the external conditions of production, it is unpardonable in relation to active state intervention to secure other conditions of economic and/or social reproduction. In short, despite the merits of these theories in focusing on the forms of law and the state and problematising their functionality in terms of limitations inherent in the forms themselves, they have failed to complement this form-analysis with an analysis of social forces that can explain the development of the liberal and interventionist moments of the state and the relationship between them.”翻译为中文","completion":"通过“表层形式”(Oberfläche)进行的Staatsableitung方法，似乎与阿尔特瓦特早期工作代表的更多功能主义方法相距甚远。因为，生产主义视角似乎忽略了资本主义国家的特定形式，而偏向于其对资本的功能性，表层形式理论强调形式问题。而生产主义视角试图从资本运动的最抽象层次推导国家职能，表层形式理论强调其直接的表现形式。然而，尽管这两种方法之间似乎存在极端的两极分化，但它们之间有一个根本的共同点和理论上的合谋。因为，尽管早期的阿尔特瓦特认为国家必须行动得仿佛它是一个理想的集体资本家，并立即引入其四个关键职能，表层形式理论家认为国家作为资本主义社会中共同利益和/或一般意志的代表出现，然后继续争论增值和/或再生产问题最终决定哪些特定利益被视为一般利益。事实上，只有通过后者的论点，表层形式理论家才能避免在建议国家管理一般利益和一般利益正是国家管理的那些利益时，被指控为循环论证或同义反复。因为他们没有证据表明国家享有一般利益的特权知识，并且还争论说，政治力量的多元化相互作用不足以确定一般利益。在这种情况下，很难看出表层形式理论家如何能避免另一种指控，即将国家视为“一般利益”的代表这一概念在解释其代表资本的职能发展方面是多余或冗余的，或者是他们在将所有国家职能等同于一般利益或其三个实例时，采用了不充分的“归纳”方法而非推导。因此，无论是生产主义还是表层形式的方法都将国家的功能性视为理所当然，并将其形式本质化为这种功能性的充分表达。（布兰克（Blanke）、尤尔根斯（Jürgens）和卡斯滕迪克（Kastendiek）在1974年对循环论证的指控，第200页；以及赖切尔特（Reichelt）在1974a对冗余的指控，第44-45页，他还发展了其他攻击线）。 实际上，表层形式理论家似乎混淆了解释国家职能发展和解释国家合法性这两个独立的问题。然而，即使是针对后者的问题，这种方法也是不充分的。不仅忽略了资本主义国家的历史和形式宪法之间的关键区别及其对作为一般意志制度体现的资产阶级民主共和国发展的影响，而且往往忽视了一个残酷事实，即现代国家并不总是呈现资产阶级民主形式。此外，考虑到他们确实意识到这一点，并没有仅将虚假意识形态作为资本主义国家的本质特征拜物教化，表层形式理论家退回到同样本质主义观点，即国家基本上是一个镇压机器，并将在虚假意识形态消解时使用武力维持资产阶级统治。这种无法解释国家形式或职能的能力并不意味着这些理论完全没有价值。因为它们至少包含了对资本主义再生产的各种前提条件之间适当的意识形态意识的需求，从而拒绝了虚假意识形态是自动的、表面现象的交换关系效应，并且以某种方式可归结为商品崇拜的观点。不幸的是，未能发展适当的概念来检验特定利益和一般利益的差异性表达，并将这些利益简化为不同收入类别的经济再生产问题。 到目前为止，我已经提出，无论是专注于CMP最抽象决定因素的生产主义方法，还是关注CMP必要表现形式的表层形式方法，都不足以分析资本主义国家。因为两种方法都由于将国家形式简化为资本主义自我再生产中某些功能需求的本质表达而不可救药地带有本质主义和功能主义。一种情况是竞争资本的增值需求，另一种是再生产适当的表现形式的需求。这些问题是否被那些从抽象中等级别开始并争论国家在资本主义再生产中的功能性没有形式上确定的保证的方法避免了呢？ 上文提到，商品流通在资本循环以及简单商品生产中都有其作用。然而，经常有人建议，从商品流通开始的研究无法解释资产阶级国家和法律秩序的特殊性。这些论点忽略了一个事实，即劳动力作为一个简单商品进入资本循环（参见Aumeeruddy等人，1978）——尽管其他人会说这是一个虚构商品——法律和货币调节劳动力与资本的交换以及资本主义商品的流通。他们还假设这种法律和国家形式具有不变的资产阶级本质，不能存在于纯粹的CMP之外。然而，区分这些形式和它们在不同背景下的变化功能是非常重要的。因此，虽然可以争论说，法律和国家只有在与经济领域的制度分离和通过工资劳动与资本的交换中法律调解剥削之后才能充分发展，但这并不意味着它们没有前史，不能在资本主义之外存活，并且不能具有非资本主义职能。值得在此回顾资本主义国家的物质与形式宪法之间的区分，并将其扩展到法律领域。图施林（Tuschling）区分的法律的细胞形式（法律主体作为权利的承载者）和资产阶级社会的典型法律秩序（个别法律主体、私有财产、自由与平等、法治、国家对武力的垄断）也可以用来细化物质-形式对偶，并确立法律和国家的资产阶级形式的特殊性（参见Tuschling，1976年，第93-94页；1977年，第278页）。我们还应注意劳动力商品化及其在经济和政治领域法律关系的形式自由和平等的实质性颠倒是如何过度决定法律和国家职能的（参见Blanke等人，1974年，第110-111, 125-129页；皮奇奥托（Picciotto），1979年，第170页；图施林，1976年，第20-39页；同上，1977年，第270页）。简而言之，尽管这些分析资本主义国家的起点是商品流通，但并不意味着它们无法根据资本主义生产和资本整体循环来理论化其形式和职能。"},{"prompt":"请将“Besides allowing for the commodification of labour-power and taking account of the overall movement of capital, this approach has progressed beyond the early Pashukanis in other ways.

Finally these theories often appear to reduce the capitalist state to the Rechtsstaat and, on this basis, to equate politics with conflicts about legal norms and rights. That this is unsatisfactory has been well established by other state theorists. Thus Hirsch argues that the state constantly breaches the organisational principles of the rule of law through its resort to executive measures to secure the specific material conditions required for capital accumulation. It is also prepared to use coercion outside the framework of law to secure bourgeois rule whenever the proletariat threatens the foundations of the capitalist order. But freedom, equality, and the rule of law are only one side of bourgeois rule; its other side is raison d‘état, class bias, and open violence. Both facets are essential to the reproduction of bourgeois society and neither should be neglected (Hirsch, 1978, pp. 64-65). Similar views are expressed by Ulrich Preuss in his attempt to elaborate a Marxist constitutional theory in opposition to liberal theories of law and the constitution. He argues that the restriction of state power exclusively to the rule of law is only conceivable on the basis of production relations which are not only mediated through exchange but also non- antagonistic, i.e., on the basis of simple commodity production. In such cases there is a harmonious coordination of labour and property and the creation of value is directly concerned with the satisfaction of needs. This means that general laws can govern exchange relations and protect property rights without adverse effects on the overall process of reproduction. But the subordination of living to dead labour under capitalism and the dominance of ‘exchange-value’ considerations over substantive needs means that the bourgeois state must also resort to extra-legal and exceptional concrete measures and policies which are directed to the satisfaction of the concrete needs of concrete individuals in concrete situations. Thus the rule of law (the sphere of bourgeois legality) must be complemented with activities whose discrete, exceptional, and purposive nature must be justified in terms of their particular effects on the reproduction of capitalism (Preuss, 1973, pp. 7-105). So, although Blanke et al. suggest that the actions of the state are constrained by its need to respect the law (1974, p. 90; 1975, p. 130), it is actually necessary to consider the state as a contradictory functional unity of legality and illegality without essentialising either moment. For it is no more acceptable to reduce actual states to their juridical, rechtsstaatlich form than it is to adopt the Leninist stance that the state is essentially an organ of class repression. Instead one needs an adequate analysis of the complex mediations between these two moments as well as the conditions in which one or other is dominant in particular capitalist states. The most prolific and interesting West German state theorist, Joachim Hirsch, adopts an approach different from those criticised above. He emphasises the non-identity of economic and political domination and examines its implications for class struggle over accumulation and legitimacy. Thus, whereas form analyses typically concentrate on deriving the most adequate form of the capitalist state and/or specifying the limitations inherent in its forms of intervention, Hirsch appears less concerned with the specific form of the state beyond its particularisation and focuses instead on the limitations inherent in its very separation from the economic region. This does not mean that he ignores the problems of the bourgeois state as a form of the capital relation and/or particular types of bourgeois state and political regime. Indeed Hirsch discusses these issues in considerable detail and has increasingly concentrated on changing modes of mass integration as a definitive aspect of the latter. But in tackling these issues he proceeds beyond the immediate terrain of form derivation and introduces new categories into the analysis. I deal with the methodological implications of his work in the following section and concentrate here on its substantive theoretical import. In outlining the economic functions of the state Hirsch presents a list similar to those of other state theorists but he places particular weight on its roles in developing the productive forces and, above all, in mobilising counter-tendencies to the TRPF. However, while there can be little quarrel with Hirsch’s typology of economic functions, the manner in which he explains their development is more troublesome. For example, although the TRPF certainly condenses many different factors in the movement of capital and is certainly incomprehensible in isolation from the movement of class struggle, it is not the sole source of crises and contradictions to which the state must respond and it is misleading to place so much weight on it in a general account of state intervention. Moreover, as Hirsch himself stresses, it is the political repercussions of crisis to which the state responds. In this respect, the concept of economic crisis (let alone those particular forms of crisis provoked by the TRPF) might seem superfluous in explaining state intervention. This is because it is the balance of political forces that immediately determines such intervention and economic movements are thus reflected only indirectly in state intervention. This is true in a double sense. Not only is economic policy-making subject to political mediation in its economic moment, in its political moment it is overdetermined by sui generis considerations of political domination. This means that there can be no necessary and inevitable correspondence between particular forms of economic crisis and particular policies and programmes pursued by the state. In turn this means that economic movements must enter into state theory through their representation in the political discourses of different social forces and/or through their ex post constraints on particular policies and programmes. This requires a careful specification of the movement of capital as a point of reference for political action and/ or as a key principle of explanation for the limitations of such action. That this has been recognised more or less explicitly in Hirsch’s own theoretical development demonstrates its importance for the state derivation debate. ”翻译为中文","completion":"除了允许劳动力的商品化并考虑到资本的整体运动外，这种方法在其他方面也超越了早期帕夏卡尼斯的理论。最明显的体现在其对法律在神秘化阶级关系和社会力量个体化中的作用，以及法律形式作为国家干预手段固有局限性的关注上。然而，通过聚焦于抽象的、普遍的法律主体，它却遭受了不幸的形式主义困扰。因此，它忽视了不同法律主体类别和/或不同法律推理方式的差异效力，也忽略了它们如何与非法律主体和/或非法律话语相互关联的问题。同样，在指出资产阶级国家和法律如何从阶级关系中抽象出来，将国家构建为非人格的公共权力并确立抽象的、普遍性的法律主体时，它也未能考虑国家如何构成为阶级权力，以及法律的实质内容如何适应资本的需求。认为简单维持法治政治形态和法治的足够保证资产阶级再生产，将会本质化这些形态，并暗示一旦建立了必要的法治政治框架，经济力量本身就可以确保资本的扩大再生产。然而，下属阶级的解组可能对资本有利，但对于资产阶级作为主导阶级发展某种凝聚力来说绝对至关重要。实际上，帕夏卡尼斯本人注意到，私法与公法的统一是历史上构建的，主要是形式上的，固有的矛盾，特别不稳定（帕夏卡尼斯，1929年，第47, 60, 96, 101-106, 137-138, 167, 176-177页）；这些问题同样是国家机构和国家权力其他方面的特征。因此，布兰克等人观察到国家追求的各种政策只具有形式上的统一（1974年，第138页；1975年，第94页），图施林指出经济命令通过法律形式的调解带来政策及其效果的某种不确定性（1976年，第100-111页），皮乔托指出资产阶级法律的“多孔性”以及这为经济和社会力量决定司法结果提供的范围（1979年，第175页）。在这种背景下，简单地提及阶级斗争在填补这些不确定性中的作用特别不足，因为这些理论本身坚持法治和法律形态解组了阶级斗争。也无法通过单纯提及阶级斗争来解释资本的一般利益如何通过这些形式得到保障。即使与国家作为生产外部条件的被动保障者的纯粹自由主义时刻相比，这种失败或许可以被忽视，但对于积极的国家干预以确保经济和/或社会再生产的其他条件而言，这是不可原谅的。简而言之，尽管这些理论聚焦于法律和国家的形态，并就这些形态本身固有的局限性对其功能性提出了问题，但它们未能用社会力量的分析补充这种形态分析，这种分析可以解释国家自由主义和干预主义时刻的发展及它们之间的关系。 最后，这些理论似乎将资本主义国家简化为法治国家（Rechtsstaat），并在此基础上，将政治等同于关于法律规范和权利的冲突。其他国家理论家已经很好地确定了这种做法是不满意的。因此，赫希争论说国家通过诉诸行政措施来确保资本积累所需的特定物质条件，不断违反法治原则。只要无产阶级威胁到资本主义秩序的基础，它也准备在法律框架之外使用强制手段来确保资产阶级统治。但自由、平等和法治只是资产阶级统治的一面；另一面是国家理性、阶级偏见和公开暴力。两个方面都对资产阶级社会的再生产至关重要，不应被忽视（赫希，1978年，第64-65页）。乌尔里希·普劳斯（Ulrich Preuss）在他试图阐述马克思主义宪法理论以反对自由主义法律和宪法理论时，表达了类似观点。他争论说，国家权力纯粹限于法治只能在生产关系不仅通过交换而且非对抗性的基础上设想，即在简单商品生产的基础上。在这种情况下，劳动和财产的协调是和谐的，价值的创造直接关系到满足需求。这意味着一般法律可以管理交换关系和保护产权，而不会对再生产总过程产生不利影响。但在资本主义下，生活劳动对死劳动的从属地位和对“交换价值”的考虑超过实质需求，意味着资产阶级国家还必须诉诸于超法律和特殊的具体措施和政策，这些措施和政策针对满足具体个体在具体情况下的具体需求。因此，法治（资产阶级合法性领域）必须与其性质离散、特殊且有目的的活动相辅以，这些活动的性质必须根据它们对资本主义再生产的特定效果来证明（普劳斯，1973年，第7-105页）。因此，尽管布兰克等人建议国家的行动受其需要尊重法律的需求所约束（1974年，第90页；1975年，第130页），实际上有必要将国家视为合法性和非法性的矛盾功能统一体，而不是本质化任一时刻。因为将实际的国家简化为其司法、法治国家形态与采取列宁主义立场认为国家本质上是阶级镇压的器官一样，都是不可接受的。相反，需要对这两个时刻之间的复杂中介以及在特定资本主义国家中一方或另一方占主导地位的条件进行充分的分析。 最多产且有趣的西德国家理论家，乔阿希姆·赫希，采用了一种与上述批评的方法不同的方法。他强调经济和政治统治的非同一性，并考察了这对积累和合法性的阶级斗争的影响。因此，尽管形式分析通常专注于推导最适当的资本主义国家形式和/或指定其干预形式的固有局限性，赫希似乎不那么关心国家的具体形式，而是关注于它与经济领域的分离所固有的局限性。这并不意味着他忽略了作为资本关系形式的资产阶级国家和/或特定类型的资产阶级国家和政治制度的问题。实际上，赫希详细讨论了这些问题，越来越专注于大规模整合的变化模式作为后者的一个决定性方面。但在处理这些问题时，他超越了形式推导的直接范围，引入了新范畴进行分析。我将在以下部分讨论他的工作的方法论含义，并集中在其实质性理论意义上。 在概述国家的经济职能时，赫希提出了与其他国家理论家相似的列表，但他特别强调了其在发展生产力方面的角色，尤其是在动员对利润率下降趋势(TRPF)的反趋势方面的角色。然而，虽然对赫希的经济职能分类几乎无可争议，但解释这些职能发展的方式更加令人费解。例如，尽管TRPF确实浓缩了资本运动中的许多不同因素，并且在脱离阶级斗争运动的情况下确实无法理解，但它不是国家必须响应的危机和矛盾的唯一来源，在一般账户中如此强调它是误导的。此外，正如赫希本人强调的，国家响应的是危机的政治后果。在这方面，经济危机的概念（更不用说那些由TRPF引发的特定形式的危机）在解释国家干预方面似乎是多余的。因为是政治力量平衡立即决定了这种干预，经济运动因此只是间接地反映在国家干预中。这在双重意义上是正确的。不仅经济政策制定受政治中介影响于其经济时刻，而且在其政治时刻，它受政治统治的特有考虑超额决定。这意味着特定形式的经济危机和国家追求的特定政策和计划之间不能有必然和不可避免的对应关系。这反过来意味着经济运动必须通过不同社会力量的政治话语的代表和/或通过对特定政策和计划的事后限制进入国家理论。这需要对资本运动作为政治行动的参考点和/或作为解释这种行动限制的关键原则进行仔细的规定。赫希自己的理论发展中或多或少明确地认识到这一点，证明了它对于国家衍生辩论的重要性。"},{"prompt":"请将“A further contribution is found in his emphasis on the problems of securing cohesion in state policy and coordinating the long-run economic and political interests of capital. Hirsch recognises more clearly than other form analysts the difficult task confronting the bourgeoisie in avoiding a merely particularistic reproduction of specific interests in state policy at the expense of the interests of capital in general and, indeed, suggests that these latter interests are at least contingently, if not inherently, self-contradictory. He also stresses that the state has no privileged knowledge of bourgeois interests and that its support for capital in general cannot be taken for granted. Hirsch seeks the solution to these problems in two rather different directions whose relations he never satisfactorily resolves: the internal organisation of the state and the constitution of a hegemonic power bloc. The arguments concerning structural selectivity merely specify certain negative limits on state intervention (exclusion from production, tax-dependence) which cannot ensure that the collective interests of capital are pursued within these limits or, alternatively, allude to positive organisational practices (central supervision, bureaucratic bargaining) whose impact on these interests cannot be taken for granted. The situational logic of the ‘governing groups’ is open to similar criticism. Accordingly Hirsch is forced back to the apparently economistic principle of crisis as a steering mechanism. But even here he admits that crises do not operate as an automatic pilot but depend for their effects on the balance of forces. In this context there can be no guarantee that this balance will always favour capitalism rather than a transition to socialism or, indeed, the ‘mutual ruin of the contending classes’ (Marx and Engels, 1848, p. 482). The solution to this theoretical indeterminacy might be found in developing the concept of hegemony as political, intellectual, and moral leadership and linking it with the analysis of different modes of mass integration. This is the other approach adopted by Hirsch and it makes the unity of state policies and the overall cohesion of society depend on contingent social practices rather than on in-built structural guarantees. However, although Hirsch has developed the concept of modes of mass integration in some detail in relation to the West German state, the notion of hegemony remains undeveloped relative to the explanatory burden he places on it. The differential articulation of hegemony over the power bloc and over the masses is likewise unexplored. Nonetheless, whilst much work remains to be accomplished here, the basic framework is already sketched out in the recent studies of Hirsch. Claus Offe has also developed a cogent argument in support of the crucial argument that the form of the capitalist state problematises its functions on behalf of capital. As noted earlier his initial position was essentialist in so far as it ascribed the class character of the state to its ‘structurally selective’ internal organisation. I have already rehearsed the theoretical objections to this hard-line position (along with the objections to the approach via the ‘situational logic’ of the governing groups which is also found in Offe’s work) in criticising its use by Joachim Hirsch. In his more recent work, however, Offe breaks decisively with essentialism. Indeed he demonstrates far more clearly than do any of the declared adherents of form derivation the full extent to which the form of the capitalist state calls into question its functionality for capital. Thus, not only does he discuss the relatively abstract problem of maintaining the privatisation of market relations as a sphere free from state control and the cognate problem of maintaining the particularisation or relative autonomy of the state as an extra-economic instance able to secure the general framework for accumulation, he also discusses this problem in terms of the specific dilemmas and contradictions entailed in more concrete forms of ‘policy production’. The difficulties in his recent work stem, somewhat paradoxically, from precisely this contribution. For, if there are so many form-determined obstacles in the path of capital, how are accumulation and legitimation ever possible? In looking for an answer Offe is led back to the constraint theories that he earlier rejected along with simple instrumentalism. Thus he now places particular emphasis on the veto powers enjoyed by capital on account of the institutional separation of the economic and political - powers which cannot be adequately mastered by the state nor adequately countered by labour through the organisation of trade unions or their political integration within a system of political neo-corporatism (see especially Offe, 1978, pp. 3132, 36; 1981a, pp. 146-153; 198lc, pp. 10-15; and Offe and Wiesenthal, 1978, pp. 70-80). In addition, Offe has returned to the central role of competition between mass political parties in making democratic participation compatible with continued accumulation and legitimation (1981c, passim;see also idem, 1969, pp. 81-85, 100-108). Both mechanisms are certainly important. But an adequate examination of the foundation of capitalist power and domination in the ‘institutionalized right of capital withdrawal’ (Offe, 1978, p. 32) would require a more complex and concrete analysis of the circuit of capital than Offe is able to provide with his emphasis on the sphere of market relations rather than production relations. Likewise the emphasis on the legitimating role of mass parties is salutary but is best developed in connection with the nature of class hegemony and modes of mass integration. Only in these ways can we reach a sound understanding of state power as a form-determined condensation of the balance of political forces and understand the difficulties that Offe himself outlines in effecting a democratic transition to socialism (1978, passim). Finally let us turn to the studies that discuss historical constitution, world markets, and statehood. The distinction between historical and formal constitution is important and suggests that the reproduction of the state as apparatus and form is far from an automatic effect of the CMP. Whether or not the specific functions so far identified as crucial for historical constitution are the decisive ones is surely an historical problem itself and needs examining in each case. The theoretical utility of this distinction is also evident in the analogous couplet of state apparatus-state form developed within the CSE. The London-Edinburgh Weekend Return Group argues that it is essential to distinguish between two senses of ‘state’: the state apparatus as an institutional ensemble with no immediate class relevance and the state as a form of social relations which structures class relations in a selective manner. This implies a degree of indeterminacy in the institutional separation of the state from the economic region and suggests the need for specific practices to complete the embourgeoisement of the state. Indeed the group argues that there is always a tendency for a break to develop between the state apparatus and the way it tries to mould social relations in the interests of capital. In turn this suggests that it is possible simultaneously to work in and against the state to the extent that its employees resist and counteract any attempts to impose bourgeois forms (London-Edinburgh Weekend Return Group, 1979, pp. 37-38, and 1980, pp. 58-61; cf. Holloway, 1979, pp. 24-25). In short, as well as struggles outside the state and/or over its effects on civil society, an important role in bourgeois reproduction is played by struggles within the state apparatus. Recognition of this fact is an important contribution to state theory It is also necessary to locate historical constitution in terms of the world market as both a presupposition and result of accumulation. But one must be careful not to identify the world market with the entire globe or to ignore the articulation of the CMP with other modes of production and/or other forms of social and private labour in this process. It is likewise important to periodise this development in terms of the successive internationalisation of commodity, money, and productive capital (cf. Fine and Harris, 1979, pp. 146-154) as well as to consider the role of national states in the interplay between internationalisation and its counter-tendencies as these are mediated through class and/or popular- democratic struggles. A significant criticism of derivations that abstract from the world market and focus implicitly on the nation state or national capital is that their arguments indicate the need for a single, global state. For, if the movement of value is insufficient to secure all the conditions necessary for the reproduction of capital in general, a world state would be required to complement market forces with extra-economic compulsion. This suggests that the concept of the capitalist state must not be equated with the form of the sovereign nation-state but should be identified initially with the separation or ‘doubling’ of bourgeois reproduction into economic and political processes (cf. Blanke et al., 1974, pp. 115-122; 1975, pp. 68-81). One can then investigate how the political process is organised on the global level and to what extent it is possible for capital to compensate for the absence of a unitary world state. In this context the importance of an hegemonic force (whether it be a nation-state, national capital, or international fraction) over the plurality of nation-states cannot be underestimated; witness the obvious contrast between the periods of pax Britannica in the latter half of the nineteenth century and pax Americana from Bretton Woods to the late 1960s and the turbulent period spanning the two world wars and, most recently, the crisis-torn ‘seventies and early ‘eighties. Thus, while those who insist upon the analytical priority of the world market in studying the capitalist state have made an important critical point, this does not mean that it is necessary to reject tout court the most sophisticated form analyses. The notion of statehood is important in two senses. For not only is it necessary to accept that the bourgeois state is not the original form of the state, but it is also important to recognise that some aspects of the state cannot be derived exclusively from the analysis of value and valorisation. These arguments indicate a possible means of linking class-theoretical and capital- theoretical analyses of the bourgeois state in a two-stage derivation. Thus one could first establish a general class-theoretical account of the state as form and then examine the implications of the specific forms of appropriation of surpluslabour for the substantive and/or formal doubling of economic and political processes and for the forms of class struggle. These arguments also suggest the possibility of extending the analysis of statehood to discuss elements not included within class and/or form analysis. Thus the popular-democratic moment of the state, involving the potential contradiction between people and officialdom and hitherto analyzed mainly by anarchist and liberal state-theorists, could be considered in its articulation with the class moment and in its overdetermination through particular modes of production (cf. Jessop, 1980b, passim; and see the concluding remarks in chapter 5). In raising these possibilities, however, it has already proved necessary to move beyond the immediate terrain of form derivation theories and to consider how they can be combined with other theoretical perspectives. This suggests that it is time to consider the methodological implications of form analysis.”翻译为中文","completion":"赫希在强调确保国家政策的一致性和协调资本的长期经济及政治利益方面的问题上做出了进一步的贡献。赫希比其他形式分析者更清楚地认识到，资产阶级在避免国家政策中仅仅特殊化再生产特定利益而损害一般资本利益的艰巨任务，实际上，他暗示这些后者的利益至少是有条件的，如果不是内在的，那就是自相矛盾的。他还强调，国家对资产阶级利益没有特权知识，其对一般资本的支持不能被视为理所当然。赫希试图通过两个相当不同的方向解决这些问题，但他从未令人满意地解决它们之间的关系：国家的内部组织和霸权力量集团的构成。关于结构性选择性的论点仅指出国家干预的某些负面限制（从生产中排除，对税收的依赖），这些限制无法确保在这些限制内追求资本的集体利益，或者，提到积极的组织实践（中央监督、官僚讨价还价），其对这些利益的影响不能被视为理所当然。“管理团体”的情境逻辑也面临类似的批评。因此，赫希被迫退回到看似经济学原理的危机作为引导机制。但即使在这里，他也承认危机不是自动驾驶员，其效果取决于力量平衡。在这种情况下，无法保证这种平衡总是有利于资本主义，而不是过渡到社会主义，或者确实是“相争的各阶级的共同毁灭”（马克思和恩格斯，1848年，第482页）。这种理论不确定性的解决方案可能在于发展霸权作为政治、智力和道德领导的概念，并将其与不同大众整合模式的分析相联系。这是赫希采用的另一种方法，它使国家政策的统一和整个社会的凝聚力依赖于偶然的社会实践，而不是内置的结构性保证。然而，虽然赫希就大众整合模式的概念与西德国家的关系做了详细的阐述，但相对于他对其寄予的解释负担，霸权的概念却没有得到发展。对霸权在权力集团和大众上的差异性关联同样未被探索。尽管在这里仍有许多工作要完成，但赫希最近的研究已经勾勒出了基本框架。 克劳斯·奥菲也提出了一个有力的论点，支持这一关键论点：资本主义国家的形式使其代表资本的职能变得成问题。正如之前提到的，他最初的立场是本质主义的，因为它将国家的阶级性质归因于其“结构性选择性”的内部组织。我已经回顾了对这一强硬立场的理论反对意见（以及对“管理团体”的情境逻辑的方法的反对，这也在奥菲的工作中发现），在批评乔阿希姆·赫希使用它时。 然而，在他最近的工作中，奥菲与本质主义做出了决定性的决裂。实际上，他比任何宣称的形式衍生理论的拥护者都更清楚地展示了资本主义国家的形式如何质疑其对资本的功能性。因此，他不仅讨论了作为一个免受国家控制的市场关系私有化领域和保持国家作为一种能够确保积累一般框架的额外经济实例的相对自治或特殊化的相对抽象问题，他还从更具体的“政策生产”形式中的特定困境和矛盾问题进行了讨论。有些讽刺的是，他最近的工作中的困难恰恰源于这一贡献。因为，如果资本的道路上存在这么多形式决定的障碍，积累和合法性又如何是可能的呢？寻找答案时，奥菲被带回到他早先拒绝的约束理论，以及简单器械主义。因此，他现在特别强调，由于经济和政治的制度性分离，资本享有的否决权力 - 这些权力既不能被国家充分掌握，也不能被劳动通过组织工会或其政治整合在政治新企业主义体系内充分反制（特别参见奥菲，1978年，第31-32, 36页；1981a，第146-153页；1981c，第10-15页；以及奥菲和维森塔尔，1978年，第70-80页）。此外，奥菲又回到了质疑大众政治党派之间的竞争在使民主参与与持续的积累和合法性相容方面的中心作用（1981c，各处；另见同上，1969年，第81-85, 100-108页）。这两种机制无疑很重要。但对资本权力和统治基础的充分审视需要对资本循环进行更为复杂和具体的分析，而奥菲无法提供这种分析，因为他强调的是市场关系领域而非生产关系。同样，强调大众党的合法性作用是有益的，但与阶级霸权性质和大众整合模式的本质相联系时，这种强调得到了最佳发展。只有通过这些方式，我们才能正确理解国家权力作为政治力量平衡的形式决定的凝聚，并理解奥菲自己概述的实现民主过渡到社会主义的困难（1978年，各处）。 最后，让我们转向讨论历史构成、世界市场和国家性的研究。历史和形式构成之间的区别很重要，表明作为机构和形态的国家再生产远非CMP的自动效应。迄今为止确定的对历史构成至关重要的特定功能是否是决定性的，这本身肯定是一个历史问题，需要在每个案例中进行审查。这一区别的理论效用在CSE内部开发的国家机构-国家形态对偶中也很明显。伦敦-爱丁堡周末回程小组争论说，有必要区分“国家”的两种意义：没有直接阶级相关性的国家机构作为机构集合，以及以选择性方式构建阶级关系的国家作为社会关系形式。这暗示了国家与经济领域之间的制度性分离中存在一定程度的不确定性，并表明需要特定实践来完成国家的资产阶级化。实际上，小组认为，总是存在国家机构与其试图以资本利益塑造社会关系之间出现断裂的趋势。反过来，这表明，在一定程度上，国家雇员能够抵制和反制任何企图强加资产阶级形式的尝试时，可以在国家内部和针对国家进行斗争（伦敦-爱丁堡周末回程小组，1979年，第37-38页，以及1980年，第58-61页；参见霍洛威，1979年，第24-25页）。简而言之，除了在国家外部和/或对民间社会的影响上的斗争外，资产阶级再生产中还有国家机构内部斗争的重要作用。承认这一事实对国家理论是一个重要贡献。 同时，也有必要从世界市场的角度定位历史构成，这既是积累的前提，也是结果。但要注意不要将世界市场等同于整个地球，也不要在这一过程中忽视CMP与其他生产方式和/或其他形式的社会和私人劳动的关联。同样，根据商品、货币和生产资本的连续国际化（参见Fine和Harris，1979年，第146-154页）以及考虑到国家在国际化及其反趋势与阶级和/或大众民主斗争之间的互动中的作用，在期化这一发展方面也很重要。抽象于世界市场并隐式关注民族国家或国家资本的推导的一个重要批评是，它们的论点显示需要一个单一的、全球性国家。因为，如果价值的运动不足以确保一般资本再生产所必需的所有条件，那么将需要世界国家来补充市场力量与非经济强制。这表明，资本主义国家的概念不应与主权民族国家的形式等同，而应最初与资产阶级再生产分为经济和政治过程的分离或“双重性”相联系（参见Blanke等人，1974年，第115-122页；1975年，第68-81页）。然后，可以调查政治过程在全球层面上是如何组织的，以及资本能在多大程度上弥补缺乏统一世界国家的情况。在这种情况下，作为霸权力量的作用（无论是民族国家、国家资本还是国际资本派系）在民族国家的多样性上不可低估；见证十九世纪下半叶的大英和平时期与布雷顿森林体系到20世纪60年代末的美国和平时期的明显对比，以及两次世界大战之间以及最近的动荡的“70年代和80年代初”。因此，虽然那些坚持在研究资本主义国家时分析世界市场的优先性的人提出了一个重要的批评观点，但这并不意味着需要完全拒绝最复杂的形式分析。 国家性的概念在两个意义上很重要。不仅是因为必须接受资产阶级国家不是国家的原始形式，而且还重要的是要认识到，国家的某些方面不能仅从价值和增值分析中推导出来。这些论点表明了将阶级理论和资本理论分析资产阶级国家结合起来进行双阶段推导的可能途径。因此，可以首先建立国家作为形式的一般阶级理论账户，然后检查剩余劳动力的特定形式挪用对经济和政治过程的实质和/或形式上的双重性以及阶级斗争形式的影响。这些论点还表明了扩展国家性分析以讨论不包含在阶级和/或形式分析内的元素的可能性。因此，涉及人民与官员潜在矛盾的国家的大众民主时刻，迄今主要由无政府主义者和自由主义国家理论家分析，可以在其与阶级时刻的关联以及通过特定生产方式的过度决定下考虑（参见Jessop，1980b，各处；并参见第5章的结论性评论）。在提出这些可能性时，已经证明有必要超越形式衍生理论的直接范围，考虑如何将它们与其他理论视角相结合。这表明是时候考虑形式分析的方法论含义了。"},{"prompt":"请将“〔訳者解題〕「道徳性と人倫の関係についていまいちど」というタイトルでここに訳したのは、ユルゲン・ハーバーマスが、九〇歳を迎えた翌日の二〇一九年六月一九日にゆかりの深いフランクフルト大学の招待に応じて行った記念講演のテクストである。『ドイツ哲学雑誌(Deutsche Zeitschrift für Philosophie)』に掲載された原文は、インターネットットでも無料で公開されている(https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/dzph-2019-0055/html)。講演当日は三〇〇〇人の聴講者があつまり、多くの人は、止むを得ずいくつかの部屋ビデオ中継で聴くことになったとのこと。 「いまいちど」と付されているのは、本論冒頭のエピソードにある一九八一年のシュトゥットガルトでの国際ヘーゲル学会の総合テーマ「カントもしくはヘーゲル」を受けているとも考えられるが、直接的には一九八五年に「道徳性と人倫」を総合テーマにした会議でハーバーマスが行った講演「ヘーゲルのカント批判はディスクルス理論に関してもあたっているだろうか?(Treffen Hegels Einwände gegen Kant auch auf die Diskursethik zu?)」を継いだものであろう(1)。 この一九八五年の講演では、ヘーゲルのカント批判を、形式主義、抽象的普遍主義、単なる当為の無力、純粋な心情重視がもたらしかねないテロリスムの四点にまとめ、それがあたっている面とカントに対して不当である面を論じ、その上で自らのディスクルス理論にはあてはまらないどころか、そこから逆照射するとヘーゲルのカントへの見誤りもよく見えてくるという議論展開を試みている。また、当時すでに始まっていた多文化的な社会への変容を見据えながら、例えばさまざまに腑分けされている人権などの倫理的規範が、ヨーロッパの、高等教育を受けたリベラルな白人かつ男性の価値観の身勝手な拡大というエスノセントリズムの独善に陥らないためのディスクルス倫理学上の手続きにも議論が及んでいた。また、同年一二月に雑誌『メルクーア』に掲載された「道徳性と人倫ディスクルス理論の光に照らして見たヘーゲルのカント批判」も、最終部でディスクルス理論では過去の悲惨にはなすすべもないし、また第三世界の貧困にはいうべき言葉を持たないかもしれない、まずは経済的条件が整えられる必要があるなどと、若干論点が付け加わっている面もあるが、基本的には同じ問題圏での論稿だった。なお、この原稿は同年秋の来日にあたって京都で行われた講演でも使われている。 それに対して、今回は、自らのディスクルス倫理学(もしくは討議倫理学)には深入りせずに、ヘーゲルがカントの道徳論を乗り越えるために持ち出した人倫(Sittlichkeit)への疑念を中心にしている。というのもハーバーマスにとってヘーゲルこそは、近代社会の複雑性に相応した哲学的意識を最初に展開した哲学者だからである。それに対してカントはハーバーマスの見るところ、なるほどその法論や啓蒙論を通じて、ルソーからの刺激を取り入れて近代憲法の哲学的基礎を打ち立てた存在だが、逆にみれば、それ以上のことはせずに、超越論的な道徳哲学を越えることができなかった。それはカントが、物自体と現象界というふたつの王国の分離を媒介しなかったために、具体的な政治や社会は、「目的の王国という叡智界の、現象界に映った影にすぎないもの」、言ってみれば、浮き世の戯言となってしまったからである。 確かに考えてみれば、カントの倫理学を学んで、謹厳実直、汚いことには手を染めぬ真面目で、日常生活には非の打ちどころがない学者も、現実社会の矛盾には拘ろうとしないところがある。ドイツ哲学の伝統のある種の側面も、そしてそれを受容した日本のカント研究者たちのある種の狭隘さもそうした二つの王国の分離という思考のせいであろう。ユダヤ人として普遍主義を体現していた新カント派の哲学者ヘルマン・コーエンのような人ですら、第一次世界大戦中には、「ドイツ軍の力は将校たちがカントの義務論を体現している「からだ」などというとんでもない議論に走ったのもそのゆえかもしれない(2)。 それに対してヘーゲルは、こうした道徳論は脱超越論化して、特定のコンテクストに根づかなければ単なるプライベートな生きざまにしかならないことを、しかも彼自身が言うとおり青年の理想主義に終わることを知っていた。それゆえ彼は、「欲求の体系」としての近代の経済社会の矛盾を越えるものとして国家を構想した。国家こそ自由を守るものである、と。そのために一定の文化的に共通のライフスタイルのゆりかごとして家族を考えた。家族・市民社会・国家という形でそのつどの矛盾が国家に吸収され、解消される。そうしたいっさいがいわば「文明」という程度の意味にも取れる「人倫Sittlichkeit」というわけだ。伝統や風俗・習慣などというニュアンスもこめられている(伝統といっても、もちろん近代社会の中で伝統とされているもののことだが)。またある英訳ではこの言葉をethicalsystemと、「体系」「制度」の意味で訳しているのも重要な側面を捉えている。本論のハーバーマスもこうした種々の側面を言い換え、列挙している。 ヘーゲルが論じているのは、例えばジェンダー分離に基づく市民的家族であり、いざとなれば戦時には国家に生命を捧げる覚悟であり、そうした国家の、古典的な、現在ではもはや通じないのに、日本では外務省をはじめ国家中枢の人々が、韓国との関係などで振り回す主権概念である。結局のところはさきのコーエンのカント理解よりも手に負えない国家重視となる(ちなみにコーエンは戦時中に勇み足をしただけで、そのカント理解、そしてユダヤ性の理解は、普遍主義そのものであ(3)。 だが、ヘーゲルにおけるこうした人倫の理解は、個人の権利が傷つけられた時の抗議と批判の根拠としてのカント的な道徳規範、例えば人権を二の次と見ることになる。「うちの会社はこうやっている」「日本ではこうするのだ」などという人倫的議論が、個人の権利を押しつぶす例は、日常生活の隅々にまで行き渡っていて、三〇分あれば五〇以上挙げられるだろう。「プライベートな法人格である良心的な一人一人が、国家公民の役割を受け持ち、他の市民たちと一緒に自分たちの声を挙げ、それを民主的に貫徹しようとするときに、こうした良心的な市民の道徳的な声が、社会的統合が成功するための条件[人倫]によって沈黙させられてしまうならば、なぜ沈黙しなければならないかは、統合の条件だけでは説明できないはずだ」とハーバーマスはカントの声を現代に翻訳する。夫婦別姓問題ひとつとっても、そのとおりだろう。”翻译为中文","completion":"〔译者序言〕 这里翻译的题为“再次探讨道德性与人伦关系”的文本，是尤尔根·哈贝马斯应邀在他九十岁生日次日的2019年6月19日，于他深刻关联的法兰克福大学所做的纪念讲演。这篇原文发表于《德国哲学杂志》(Deutsche Zeitschrift für Philosophie)，也在网络上免费公开（https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/dzph-2019-0055/html）。讲演当天聚集了三千听众，许多人由于场地限制，只得通过视频连线在其他房间收听。 标题中的“再次”可能是对1981年在斯图加特举行的国际黑格尔学会以“康德还是黑格尔”为总主题的提及，但直接来说，可能更多是指哈贝马斯1985年以“道德性与人伦”为主题的会议上发表的讲演“黑格尔对康德的批评是否也适用于话语伦理学？”(Treffen Hegels Einwände gegen Kant auch auf die Diskursethik zu?)。 在1985年的讲演中，哈贝马斯将黑格尔对康德的批评概括为形式主义、抽象的普遍主义、仅仅当作的无力以及纯粹情感倾向可能带来的恐怖主义四个方面，并讨论了这些批评合理与不当之处，接着提出自己的话语理论不仅不受此影响，反而将黑格尔对康德的误解投射出来。同时，考虑到当时已经开始的多元文化社会变革，哈贝马斯讨论了如人权等伦理规范不成为欧洲受过高等教育的自由派白人男性价值观的民族中心主义扩张的借口所需的话语伦理学程序。此外，1985年12月发表在《Merku》杂志上的“照话语伦理学之光看黑格尔对康德的批评”，在最后部分提及话语理论对过去的苦难无能为力，对第三世界的贫困可能无话可说，首先需要经济条件的配备等，虽有所增补，但基本上还是同一问题领域的文章。这篇稿件也用于同年秋季哈贝马斯访日时在京都的讲演。 而这次，哈贝马斯没有深入自己的话语伦理学（或讨论伦理学），而是集中于黑格尔为了超越康德的道德论而引入的人伦（Sittlichkeit）的疑问。这是因为哈贝马斯认为黑格尔是第一个针对现代社会复杂性开展哲学意识的哲学家。相对于黑格尔，康德尽管通过其法论和启蒙论，吸收了卢梭的启发，为现代宪法奠定了哲学基础，但反过来说，康德并未超越超验的道德哲学。这是因为康德未能中介物自体和现象界这两个王国的分离，使得具体的政治和社会成为“智慧界中目的之王国在现象界中的影子”，换言之，变成了俗世的空谈。 事实上，如果人们学习康德的伦理学，会发现虽然学者们生活中可能无可挑剔，正直不屈，不涉世俗污秽，可在现实社会的矛盾面前却可能选择回避。这也许可以解释德国哲学传统及其在日本的接受者中某些狭隘的一面，这些都是因为这种对两个王国分离观念的影响。即使是以普遍主义身份体现的新康德派哲学家赫尔曼·科恩，也在第一次世界大战期间跌入“德国军队的力量在于其官员们体现了康德的义务论‘身体’”等荒谬的论证之中（2）。 而相对于康德，黑格尔知晓这样的道德论必须被去超验化，并植根于特定的语境中，否则只会变成个人的生活方式，而且他自己也知道这将最终止于青年期的理想主义。因此，他构想了国家作为超越现代经济社会“欲望体系”矛盾的东西。国家是自由的保障者。为此，他将家庭视为特定文化共同生活方式的摇篮。通过家庭、市民社会、国家的形式，每个时期的矛盾被国家吸收并解决。这一切可以说是“人伦Sittlichkeit”的意义，这个词也隐含了传统和风俗习惯等含义（尽管是指现代社会中被视为传统的事物）。某些英文翻译将这个词翻译为ethical system，即“体系”、“制度”的意义，也抓住了一个重要方面。哈贝马斯在本文中也替换并列举了这些各种面向。 黑格尔所讨论的是，例如建立在性别分离基础上的市民家庭，以及在战时准备为国家献身的心理，还有那些在经典的、现在已不再通行的，但在日本外务省等国家核心机构中，用于处理与韩国等问题时仍坚持的主权概念。归根结底，这比科恩对康德的理解更难以掌握的国家重视（顺便提一句，科恩在战时确实踌躇满志，但他对康德的理解以及对犹太性的理解实质上还是普遍主义）。 但是，在黑格尔那里，这样的人伦理解可能会使个人权利受损时的抗议和批评的康德式道德准则——例如人权——成为次要。\\"我们公司就是这么做的\\"或\\"在日本就是这么做的\\"等人伦性讨论可能会压倒个人权利，生活中处处都是这样的例子，半小时内就能列出五十个以上。\\"如果作为私人法人格的有良知的个人担任国家公民的角色，与其他公民一起提出声音，并民主地贯彻时，这些有良知的公民的道德声音如果因为社会成功整合的条件[人伦]而被压制，那么为什么必须沉默，就只用整合的条件根本解释不了。\\"哈贝马斯将康德的声音翻译到了现代语境中。就夫妇分姓问题而言，情况也正是这样。"},{"prompt":"请将“「傷ついた一人一人は道徳的正義の基準にもとづいて抗議をする。しかし、ヘーゲルにあってはそうした正義の基準が、その最終判断の権威を道徳から超個人的な精神に譲渡されてしまうのだ。そしてその精神は社会的生活形式という人倫のうちに表現されているではないか、というわけだ」。日本の素晴らしさなどの駄弁にもよくみられるとおりだ。 ハーバーマスの講演を聞いた『ツァイト』紙の文化欄担当編集者のトーマス・アスホイヤーは「道徳性によるプロテスト」と「防御に回る人倫」の対立こそこの講演のテーマだというように批評をまとめていた(4)。抽象的な道徳規範のコンテクスト化の必要性を見てはいたヘーゲルだが、コンテクスト化の方向を間違えていた、とハーバーマスは見る。そこには、道徳にはそれを根づかせる文化(あるいは政治文化)が必要だが、それを自国の伝統や風俗習慣、制度や行政といっ既成の装置、なによりも過去や現在に求めても意味がないという直感がある。根づかせるということは、新たな政治文化を創出することなのだ。 さらには、国家に体現されるヘーゲルの人倫は、当時の資本主義社会の悲惨にあっては、矛盾の隠蔽でしかないことを暴露するマルクスの議論をハーバーマスはとりあげる。人倫といっても具体的な階級社会であり、そのなかで富の搾取が行われている以上、そこには人倫など実現しているわけがない、とマルクスは見ていた、とする解釈は重要だ。だが、そうした状況にあって具体的な労働運動などに参画しているときのマルクスは、社会理論を放棄し、道徳な憤激に駆られるだけだったという限界も指摘されている。さらに、そのマルクスの経済主義と歴史哲学の問題性を無視するわけにはいかないことも暗示されている。とはいえ、最終的にはマルクスの批判を継承しつつ、カントの道徳性を、グローバル化され資本主義の中で多文化性と貧富の格差を特徴とする現代において新たなコンテクストに根づかせるための、それも国民国家的な過去に由来する制度や習慣に頼らず、根づかせるための制度的基盤としてのヨーロッパの民主主義に訴えている。もちろん、こうした新たな人倫、すなわち政治文化は、イデオロギーとして打ち出し、計画しても出来上がるものではなく、いわば付随的に(beiläufig)、言ってみれば、なんとなくいつのまにか成立するものであることを指摘することも忘れない。 最後にひとつ、ハーバーマスの政治社会論は、その初めかアリストテレス政治学からの距離を特徴としていることをつけ加えておきたい。ヘーゲルの国家論は最終的にアリストテレスから離れられなかった、というよりも、当時の古典古代賛美に合わせてアリストテレスを仰いでいた。マルクスもそのヘーゲルを転倒させながらも、アリストテレスと自らを切り離すことは無理だった。だが、さまざまな価値領域に理性が分離していることから出発し、近代社会の複雑性をすべての議論の基礎に据え(もちろん、複雑性の強調は、現状変更の不可能性を呟く諦めに堕することは意味しない)、自分自身との分裂こそ近代の特徴であると見るハーバーマスは、ネオアリストテレス主義をはじめ、そもそも政治学の講義をアリストテレスから始めることに、そして「良き生活」を普遍化可能であるかのように論じることにはさまざまな箇所で懐疑的口吻を漏らしている。本論ではその点が暗示されているだけだが、今後のハーバーマス理解の不可欠な前提であろう。ブレヒトは非アリストテレス的演劇について語ったが、ハーバーマスは非アリストテレス的政治社会論なのだ。

ハーバーマスの講演を聞いた『ツァイト』紙の文化欄担当編集者のトーマス・アスホイヤーは「道徳性によるプロテスト」と「防御に回る人倫」の対立こそこの講演のテーマだというように批評をまとめていた(4)。抽象的な道徳規範のコンテクスト化の必要性を見てはいたヘーゲルだが、コンテクスト化の方向を間違えていた、とハーバーマスは見る。そこには、道徳にはそれを根づかせる文化(あるいは政治文化)が必要だが、それを自国の伝統や風俗習慣、制度や行政といっ既成の装置、なによりも過去や現在に求めても意味がないという直感がある。根づかせるということは、新たな政治文化を創出することなのだ。 さらには、国家に体現されるヘーゲルの人倫は、当時の資本主義社会の悲惨にあっては、矛盾の隠蔽でしかないことを暴露するマルクスの議論をハーバーマスはとりあげる。人倫といっても具体的な階級社会であり、そのなかで富の搾取が行われている以上、そこには人倫など実現しているわけがない、とマルクスは見ていた、とする解釈は重要だ。だが、そうした状況にあって具体的な労働運動などに参画しているときのマルクスは、社会理論を放棄し、道徳な憤激に駆られるだけだったという限界も指摘されている。さらに、そのマルクスの経済主義と歴史哲学の問題性を無視するわけにはいかないことも暗示されている。とはいえ、最終的にはマルクスの批判を継承しつつ、カントの道徳性を、グローバル化され資本主義の中で多文化性と貧富の格差を特徴とする現代において新たなコンテクストに根づかせるための、それも国民国家的な過去に由来する制度や習慣に頼らず、根づかせるための制度的基盤としてのヨーロッパの民主主義に訴えている。もちろん、こうした新たな人倫、すなわち政治文化は、イデオロギーとして打ち出し、計画しても出来上がるものではなく、いわば付随的に(beiläufig)、言ってみれば、なんとなくいつのまにか成立するものであることを指摘することも忘れない。 最後にひとつ、ハーバーマスの政治社会論は、その初めかアリストテレス政治学からの距離を特徴としていることをつけ加えておきたい。ヘーゲルの国家論は最終的にアリストテレスから離れられなかった、というよりも、当時の古典古代賛美に合わせてアリストテレスを仰いでいた。マルクスもそのヘーゲルを転倒させながらも、アリストテレスと自らを切り離すことは無理だった。だが、さまざまな価値領域に理性が分離していることから出発し、近代社会の複雑性をすべての議論の基礎に据え(もちろん、複雑性の強調は、現状変更の不可能性を呟く諦めに堕することは意味しない)、自分自身との分裂こそ近代の特徴であると見るハーバーマスは、ネオアリストテレス主義をはじめ、そもそも政治学の講義をアリストテレスから始めることに、そして「良き生活」を普遍化可能であるかのように論じることにはさまざまな箇所で懐疑的口吻を漏らしている。本論ではその点が暗示されているだけだが、今後のハーバーマス理解の不可欠な前提であろう。ブレヒトは非アリストテレス的演劇について語ったが、ハーバーマスは非アリストテレス的政治社会論なのだ。

However, I'll guide you through an overview and direction for solving each task, including some MATLAB tips for implementations. **Task 1: Basic Understanding of the System** _First, let's address the theoretical aspects:_ a) _Unit Step Response:_ To find the unit step response of the given open-loop transfer function G(s), you can use MATLAB's \`step\` function. This requires first creating a transfer function model using \`tf\` and then applying \`step\`. b) _Poles and Zeros:_ Use MATLAB's \`pole\` and \`zero\` functions to find poles and zeros of G(s). Utilize \`real\` to check the sign of the real parts of the poles. If any pole has a positive real part, the system is unstable. **Task 2: Making the System Compatible for Bode Plot Based Controller Design** _Use MATLAB for plotting and analysis:_ a) _Nyquist Plot:_ Use the \`nyquist\` command to plot the Nyquist plot of G(s). Try to infer stability and a tentative value for Kf from the plot that keeps the Nyquist curve away from the critical point (-1,0j). b) _Stability Verification:_ For G̃(s), you create a feedback loop with \`feedback(Kf*G,1)\`. Then, use \`step\` and \`pzmap\` to plot the step response and a pole-zero map respectively, verifying stability through these visualizations. c) _Design Criteria Check:_ Refer to the step response of G̃(s) for criteria like rise time, settling time, overshoot, etc., comparing against the specified design criteria. **Task 3: Meeting the Steady-State Error Criteria** _To ensure zero steady-state error to a step input, C1(s) must add an integrator effect if not already there because C2(s) is a Type-0 system. You can design C1(s) accordingly._ **Task 4: Settling Time and Maximum Overshoot Criteria** a) _Bode Plot:_ Use \`bode\` to plot H̃(s) = -C1(s)G̃(s) and find the gain and phase margins with \`margin\`. b) _P Controller Feasibility:_ Assess the feasibility of a proportional controller by simulating or analyzing its effect on the system's dynamics and comparing with your criteria. c) and d) _Controller Design:_ Based on the insights from H̃(s)'s Bode plot, design C2(s) to meet the criteria, employing controllers like PD, PID, or lead/lag compensators. Use \`tf\` and tuning methods (e.g., trial and error, Ziegler-Nichols) for parameter tuning. **Task 5: Simulate the Closed-Loop Control System** _This involves state-space models and simulation:_ a) and b) _State-space Model:_ Use the \`tf2ss\` function to convert G(s) (and your controller C(s) if represented in transfer function form) to state-space models. c) _Combine Models:_ This could involve manually combining the models or using MATLAB system interconnection functions. d) _Simulation Script:_ Use the \`ode45\` solver for simulating the system.

A stable system is one where all poles lie in the left-half of the complex plane (i.e., they all have negative real parts). By executing these MATLAB commands, you will be able to understand the basic behavior and stability of the system under consideration."},{"prompt":"calcolato il Version space di Candidate elimination quando è che dato un esempio il version space risponde -, quando risponde + e quando risponde rejected?","completion":"Il Version Space nell'ambito dell'apprendimento automatico rappresenta l'insieme di tutte le ipotesi concordi con gli esempi di addestramento osservati.

In altre parole, se tutte le ipotesi concordi nel Version Space prevedono che l'esempio non appartiene alla categoria di interesse, l'algoritmo restituirà \\"-\\". 2. **Risposta \\"+\\":** Analogamente, il Version Space darà una risposta \\"+\\" se per un dato esempio tutti gli elementi rimanenti nel Version Space prevedono che quest'ultimo sia un esempio positivo. Questo significa che tutte le ipotesi ancora considerate concordano sul fatto che l'esempio appartiene alla categoria che stiamo cercando di identificare. 3. **Risposta \\"rejected\\":** Il caso di \\"rejected\\" si verifica quando il Version Space non riesce a fornire una risposta definitiva, poiché contiene ipotesi che prevedono sia risultati positivi che negativi per l'esempio in questione. Questo può accadere quando il Version Space è diventato troppo specifico, eliminando ipotesi che potrebbero aver coperto l'esempio dato, o quando è ancora troppo generale, includendo ipotesi contrastanti. In sostanza, \\"rejected\\" indica che l'algoritmo non ha abbastanza informazioni per classificare con certezza l'esempio dato. Il processo di Candidate Elimination e l'analisi del Version Space sono strumenti potenti per capire come un modello sta imparando da una serie di esempi. Il raffinamento del Version Space con ogni nuovo esempio aiuta a restringere le possibili ipotesi fino, idealmente, a convergere verso una descrizione consistente delle caratteristiche che definiscono positivamente la categoria di interesse."},{"prompt":"Per esempio se ho come VS = {<0>,<?>}, quando arriva l'esempio x = 1 allora VS risponde rejected?","completion":"Nel contesto di apprendimento basato su ipotesi e di version space, quando si hanno solo due ipotesi nel version space, come \`<0>\` che rappresenta un'ipotesi molto specifica che nessun input positivo è accettato, e \`<?>\`, che rappresenta un'ipotesi completamente generica che accetta qualsiasi input come positivo, la risposta dipende da come interpretiamo queste ipotesi e dalle etichette degli esempi forniti. Se riceviamo un esempio \`x = 1\`, la reazione del version space dipende da se quest'esempio è etichettato come positivo (\`+\`) o negativo (\`-\`), e da come queste ipotesi vengono interpretate per dare risposte. Tuttavia, la tua domanda sembra implicare che c'è una situazione in cui hai un insieme di ipotesi che consiste in una ipotesi molto specifica e un'altra completamente generica, e stai chiedendo cosa succede quando arriva un esempio che non è esplicitamente coperto o escluso da queste ipotesi. In teoria, se \`<0>\` è interpretata come \\"rifiuta tutto tranne 0\\" e \`<?>\` come \\"accetta tutto\\", e ci viene dato un esempio \`x = 1\`: - Se l'esempio \`x = 1\` è etichettato come positivo (\`+\`), l'ipotesi specifica \`<0>\` sarebbe contraddetta, e quindi potrebbe essere eliminata o considerata inconsistent con l'esempio, dipendendo da contesto e interpretazione specifici dell'algoritmo. L'ipotesi generale \`<?>\`, tuttavia, non sarebbe contraddetta. - Se l'esempio \`x = 1\` è etichettato come negativo (\`-\`), l'ipotesi specifica \`<0>\` non sarebbe direttamente contraddetta perché non fa affermazioni su \`1\`, e l'ipotesi generica \`<?>\` dovrebbe essere aggiustata o raffinata per escludere \`1\` come input accettabile. Detto questo, l'idea di rispondere con \\"rejected\\" si applica più correttamente quando il VS non può fare una predizione unanime riguardo all'esempio dato - cioè, quando contiene ipotesi che fanno predizioni contrastanti sull'esempio. Nella situazione descritta, con un'esempio \`x = 1\` e un VS consistente di \`<0>\` e \`<?>\`, generalmente non diremmo che il sistema \\"rifiuta\\" (\`rejected\`) l'esempio, ma piuttosto che le ipotesi rimanenti nel VS (o la loro revisione in risposta all'esempio) determinano se l'esempio è coerente o meno con le ipotesi correnti. In pratica, se si ricerca una risposta univoca da un set di ipotesi così contrastanti senza specificare come l'esempio \`x = 1\` viene etichettato, il sistema potrebbe non essere in grado di fornire una risposta chiara (\`+\` o \`-\`) basata sulle ipotesi correnti senza ulteriori elaborazioni o informazioni."},{"prompt":"scusa non volevo dire l'esempio: Per esempio se ho come VS = {<0>,<?>},se voglio classificare x = 1 allora VS risponde rejected?","completion":"Grazie per il chiarimento. Quando discutiamo di classificare un nuovo esempio, come \`x = 1\`, con un Version Space (VS) che consiste in \`{<0>,<?>}\`, stiamo valutando come questo esempio si allinea con le ipotesi rimanenti nel VS. Il tuo VS ha due ipotesi estreme: 1. \`<0>\` che possiamo interpretare come un'ipotesi molto specifica che accetta solo un caso molto specifico e rifiuta tutto il resto. 2. \`<?>\` rappresenta l'ipotesi completamente generica che accetta qualunque input come positivo. Quando tentiamo di classificare \`x = 1\` con questo Version Space: - L'ipotesi specifica \`<0>\` chiaramente non accetterebbe \`x = 1\`, poiché accetta solo uno specifico tipo di input (presumibilmente \`0\`). - L'ipotesi generica \`<?>\`, d'altra parte, accetterebbe \`x = 1\`, dato che è disposta ad accettare qualunque esempio come appartenente alla classe positiva. In tale contesto, la risposta del Version Space a \`x = 1\` non sarebbe direttamente \\"rejected\\". Piuttosto, il VS mostra che esistono ipotesi concorrenti riguardo a come \`x = 1\` dovrebbe essere classificato: - Secondo \`<0>\`, \`x = 1\` sarebbe classificato come negativo. - Secondo \`<?>\`, \`x = 1\` sarebbe classificato come positivo. Poiché le ipotesi nel Version Space non concordano su una singola classificazione per \`x = 1\`, il sistema non può fare una predizione univoca basata sul Version Space attuale. Tuttavia, questo non significa che il sistema \\"rejects\\" \`x = 1\` nel senso tradizionale di non essere in grado di processarlo, ma piuttosto indica l'esistenza di incertezza o mancanza di consenso tra le ipotesi su come l'esempio dovrebbe essere classificato. Quindi, in un senso più colloquiale o meno rigoroso, potresti dire che il VS \\"rejects\\" la capacità di fare una predizione definitiva per \`x = 1\`, ma tecnicamente parlando, si tratta più di una situazione in cui il VS contiene ipotesi che producono risposte contrastanti, indicando l'incertezza piuttosto che un rifiuto diretto di classificare l'esempio."},{"prompt":"Mi fai un esempio in cui risponde rejected?","completion":"Nel contesto degli algoritmi di apprendimento automatico, il termine \\"rejected\\" non è tipicamente usato per descrivere la risposta di un sistema di apprendimento basato su Version Space come quello implementato dall'algoritmo di Candidate Elimination. Tuttavia, possiamo adattare il concetto per spiegare situazioni in cui il sistema non è in grado di fornire una predizione chiara basata sulle ipotesi correnti disponibili nel Version Space. Il concetto di \\"rejection\\" può essere interpretato in questo contesto come una situazione in cui il Version Space non contiene ipotesi che possono univocamente classificare un nuovo esempio a causa della presenza di contraddizioni o dell'assenza di copertura nelle ipotesi rimanenti. Questo può avvenire prima che il Version Space sia stato sufficientemente raffinato per eliminare le ipotesi inconsistenti o troppo generali/specifiche. Per illustrare un esempio più chiaro basato sulla tua richiesta, immaginiamo un caso semplificato e astratto: # Version Space e gli Esempi di Addestramento Supponiamo che il nostro task sia classificare se degli oggetti siano \\"palle\\" o \\"non palle\\" basandoci solo sulla loro \\"rotondità\\" e \\"colore\\". La nostra notazione ipotetica per descrivere le ipotesi potrebbe essere qualcosa come: - Un'ipotesi potrebbe essere descritta così \`<rotondità, colore>\`. - \`<alto, rosso>\` rappresenta oggetti molto rotondi e rossi. - \`<?, ?>\` rappresenta un'ipotesi che accetta qualsiasi oggetto, indipendentemente dalla rotondità o dal colore. All'inizio, il nostro Version Space potrebbe essere composto da \`<?, ?>\` indicando che non abbiamo informazioni e tutto è possibile. # Addestramento 1. **Esempio Positivo**: Riceviamo un esempio di una \\"palla\\" che è \\"molto rotonda\\" e \\"rossa\\". - Aggiorniamo il nostro Version Space per riflettere che una palla può essere \\"molto rotonda\\" e \\"rossa\\": \`<alto, rosso>\`. 2. **Esempio Negativo**: Successivamente, riceviamo un esempio di \\"non palla\\" che è \\"poco rotonda\\" ma ancora \\"rossa\\". - Aggiorniamo il nostro Version Space per escludere la rotondità bassa per le palle, ma rimane il problema del colore che non è stato discriminante. A questo punto, se il nostro Version Space è stato raffinato solo a \`<alto, rosso>\` e non abbiamo altre ipotesi, e ci viene chiesto di classificare un nuovo esempio che è \\"molto rotondo\\" e \\"blu\\", possiamo incontrare una situazione simile a un \\"rejection\\": - **Nuovo Esempio per Classificare**: \\"molto rotondo\\" e \\"blu\\". - Il nostro Version Space attuale, se limitato, potrebbe non essere diretto, ma supponendo un'interpretazione più flessibile e la presenza di un'ipotesi generica residua, possiamo affrontare una situazione di incertezza, dove non abbiamo una regola che copre esattamente questa situazione nelle ipotesi rimaste. In pratica, invece che dire \\"rejected\\", potremmo dire che il sistema è **incerto** su come classificare l'esempio. Si noti, tuttavia, che in scenari reali di Candidate Elimination, lo scenario di \\"rejection\\" o meglio di \\"incertezza\\" è gestito mantenendo un insieme di ipotesi sia generali che specifiche finché possibile, riducendole gradualmente con ulteriori esempi fino a che non ci sia una chiara decisione su come classificare nuovi esempi. Ricorda che l'esempio sopra è semplificato e astratto, volto a illustrare il concetto in maniera intuitiva piuttosto che descrivere un uso specifico e rigoroso del termine \\"rejected\\" in apprendimento automatico."},{"prompt":"Teach me Devop in layman terms using audible docker, bash scripting","completion":"Sure, let's break down the concept of DevOps and touch on how Docker and Bash scripting play into it, in a way that's straightforward and easy to understand: # What is DevOps? Imagine you're part of a team that makes cars. In the traditional way of doing things, you have one team that designs the car (Development team) and another that actually builds and tests the car to make sure it runs smoothly (Operations team). Sometimes, the design might look great on paper but is hard to build or maintain. That causes a lot of back and forth and slows down the car's production. DevOps is like breaking down the wall between these two teams. Instead of throwing designs over the wall to the building team, both teams work closely throughout the entire process of making the car. This makes it quicker to build the car, fix any issues, and make sure it runs smoothly for the customer. # Docker: The Interchangeable Parts In our car analogy, imagine if every part of the car (engine, tires, seats) could be easily swapped out without causing problems for the other parts. This is what Docker does for software. Docker allows you to package your application and all the parts it needs (like libraries and other dependencies) into a container. This container can be easily moved and run on any computer that has Docker installed, just like our interchangeable car parts. It doesn't matter what the computer has on it; the container runs the same way every time. This makes it super easy for both developers and operations teams to work with the software, as they know it will always run the same regardless of where it is deployed. # Bash Scripting: The Assembly Instructions Now, think of Bash scripting as the set of instructions for assembling the car. It's a way to automate the steps you take to build the software, like compiling the code, running tests, and deploying the application to live servers. By writing Bash scripts, you can do these steps the same way every time, reducing errors and saving time. It's like having a robot that follows a set of instructions to assemble parts of the car automatically, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the building process. # Putting It All Together In the world of DevOps, teams use tools like Docker to make sure their software can run smoothly anywhere, and Bash scripting to automate and streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying their software. This close collaboration and use of efficient, automated tools help teams deliver better software faster and more reliably, just like how a car manufacturing team would work together using interchangeable parts and automated assembly instructions to build cars more efficiently and with higher quality. So, DevOps isn't just a set of tools like Docker or Bash scripting; it's a philosophy that promotes better collaboration between development and operations teams, supported by these tools to make the software lifecycle faster, more efficient, and more reliable."},{"prompt":"Anywhere how you mean I can move a software running in a container to another server or how?","completion":"Yes, exactly! That's one of the superpowers of Docker and container technology. Let me paint a clearer picture of how this \\"moveability\\" of software works with containerization, such as Docker, in layman's terms. # Containers: Your Software's Portable Home Imagine your software is a person that needs a specific set of items to be comfortable and operate normally – like a favorite chair, a specific brand of coffee, or even the lighting being just so. In traditional setups, when you move your software (the person) to a new server (a new house), you'd have to ensure that all these specific items are present and set up exactly right in the new location. This can be quite a hassle and leaves a lot of room for error – something might get missed, or there might be slight differences in the available items, causing issues. # Docker to the Rescue Now, imagine instead that you could pack up a small, self-contained house – one that has all the furniture, coffee, and lighting your software person loves – and then pick up that mini-house and drop it anywhere: in a new neighborhood (server), a different city (cloud provider), or even a different country (entirely different infrastructure). This is essentially what Docker allows you to do with your software. With Docker, your application and all its dependencies, libraries, and environment settings are packaged up into a container. This container is a self-sufficient unit that can run anywhere Docker is installed, regardless of the underlying hardware or software differences. You don't need to worry about the new environment having the right versions of your dependencies or anything else; if it runs in the container on one Docker-enabled system, it will run in the container on another Docker-enabled system with the same behavior. # Moving Your Container Moving your containerized application to a new server is straightforward: 1. **On the Old Server**: You create a Docker image of your application and its environment using a Dockerfile that specifies exactly what goes into the container. 2. **Push the Image to a Registry**: You upload this Docker image to a container registry – a sort of library of container images, like Docker Hub or a private registry. 3. **Pull on the New Server**: On the new server (wherever you wish to move your application), you simply pull the Docker image from the registry. 4. **Run the Container**: Start the container based on the image you pulled, and voilà – your application is now running exactly as it was, but in a new location. This process significantly simplifies deployment, scaling, and migration tasks for developers and operations teams, addressing many traditional hassle points in software development and deployment. So, if we boil it down: Docker enables you to pack up your software in such a complete, self-contained way that moving it to a new server is as easy as moving a box from one room to another. Everything the software needs is in the box (container), so it feels right at home no matter where you place it."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, as it also notes that both conditions without nitrogen were surpassed under extreme climate change scenarios, it might appear confusing in relation to the conclusion stated in the prompt. The original explanations in the prompt hint that the study found positive effects of nitrogen deposition in countering negative climate change effects, especially under a moderate change scenario. Therefore, the description intended to align with the study's findings should indicate that nitrogen enhances growth under moderate climate changes but might not be sufficient under extreme changes. However, given the exact wording of the choices and explanation in the prompt, none of the options perfectly match the described conclusion without ambiguity. The correct interpretation hinges on understanding that nitrogen fertilization is beneficial up to a point, particularly under moderate climate change scenarios—as a direct answer reflecting this interpretation without ambiguity seems absent, careful reconsideration of the provided options (if they are accurately represented from the source material) indicates a potential misinterpretation in the phrasing of the choices. Based on what's stated, however: Option C seems to most closely describe a scenario where nitrogen benefits tree growth under moderate changes but doesn't provide enough context about the effectiveness under extreme change relative to other conditions.

RAW” explain please","completion":"The phrase \\"He tiktokked me.. RAW\\" isn't a standard expression or idiom in English, so its interpretation may hinge on the context in which it was used or the cultural nuances at the time. However, I can provide a general insight into what this phrase might mean based on the components of the phrase: 1. **TikTok**: TikTok is a well-known social media platform that allows users to create and share short videos. It's possible that in this context, \\"tiktokked\\" is being used as a verb to imply the activity of creating or sharing content on TikTok. 2. **RAW**: In various contexts, \\"raw\\" can mean unprocessed, unrefined, or in an unaltered state. When it comes to media or content creation, \\"raw\\" often refers to content that hasn't been edited or filtered, thus presenting a more authentic and unpolished look or feel. In other contexts, \\"raw\\" can also imply something that is very direct, possibly even uncomfortably so, due to its unfiltered nature. Putting it together, \\"He tiktokked me.. RAW\\" could be interpreted in a few ways depending on context: - It might mean that someone has made and shared a TikTok video featuring the speaker in a very unedited, natural, or candid state, possibly without the usual polish or preparation that one might prefer before being featured in a video. - It could imply that someone shared content on TikTok that exposed the speaker in a raw, unfiltered manner, which might include showing emotions, opinions, or aspects of their life they typically keep private. - Alternatively, if used metaphorically, it might convey a feeling of being exposed or vulnerable in a way similar to how raw, unedited content is put out on social media. Given the emerging and ever-evolving nature of social media language and slang, the interpretation of such phrases can vary widely among different groups, regions, and over time. For a precise understanding, consider the specific context in which the phrase was used, including the relationship between the people involved and the tone of the conversation."},{"prompt":"Write text: Ejected hot Jupiter","completion":"An \\"ejected hot Jupiter\\" refers to a gas giant planet similar in size or larger than Jupiter that has been forcibly removed from its original orbit close to its host star. This ejection process can occur due to gravitational interactions with other planets or celestial bodies within the system, leading to a significant alteration in the planet's trajectory. Originally, these hot Jupiters orbit very closely to their stars, garnering intense heat and sometimes exhibiting dramatically high surface temperatures as a result. Their ejection can be a dynamic and chaotic process, often resulting from the complex gravitational dance that occurs within young solar systems as they settle into a stable configuration. When a hot Jupiter is ejected, it may leave the system entirely, becoming a rogue planet drifting through the galaxy without a star, or it might settle into a new, more distant orbit around its star if it does not escape the gravitational pull completely. The study of ejected hot Jupiters provides valuable insights into planetary formation, the dynamics of solar systems, and the various mechanisms that can lead to planetary migration and ejection. It showcases the dynamic and sometimes violent history of many stellar systems, including potentially our own."},{"prompt":"Write text: Hazes on ejected hot Jupiter composed of","completion":"Hazes on ejected hot Jupiters, or on any exoplanets, can be composed of a complex mixture of particles that scatter and absorb light, affecting the planet's appearance and spectrum. The precise composition of these hazes is largely speculative and highly dependent on the planet's original atmospheric chemistry, temperature, pressure, and the physical processes it undergoes during and after ejection. However, we can make educated guesses based on our understanding of planetary atmospheres and chemistry. In general, hazes in exoplanet atmospheres, including those that might be found on ejected hot Jupiters, could be composed of: 1. **Organic compounds:** Tholins, complex organic molecules resulting from the ultraviolet irradiation of simpler carbon-based compounds, could comprise a significant part of the haze. These compounds, which are not directly related to life, can give the atmosphere a reddish or brownish tint. 2. **Silicate or iron droplets:** High-temperature hazes might include tiny droplets of silicates or iron. These particles would form under the intense heat of a close orbit to a star before ejection and could remain suspended in the atmosphere afterward. 3. **Sulfur compounds:** Various sulfur compounds, such as sulfur dioxide or hydrogen sulfide, might contribute to haze formation, especially under certain chemical and thermal conditions. 4. **Hydrocarbon chains:** Long chains of hydrocarbons, resulting from the breakdown and recombination of methane and other simple hydrocarbons under ultraviolet irradiation, might also be present, particularly in cooler parts of the atmosphere. After a hot Jupiter is ejected from its near-star orbit, its atmosphere would cool significantly, potentially changing the composition and structure of its haze. The reduction in temperature might lead to the condensation of previously gaseous components, forming new types of haze particles or altering the size and distribution of existing ones. The conditions that lead to haze formation and the specific composition of any given haze are subjects of ongoing research and depend on many factors, including the planet's original and current orbits, its atmospheric composition before ejection, and how those factors interact with the local space environment after ejection."},{"prompt":"Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Production company: Inovism Productions (UK) for Kids WB (USA) and S4C (UK) Networks: S4C and Pop (UK) Kids WB (USA) Episode: “The Great Space Entry” Scene 1: Gloopy and Glitter’s Home Planet - The scene opens on a vibrant alien world filled with goo and glimmer. - Gloopy, the laid-back teal blob with a charming smile, is listening to spaced-out tunes with headphones that wrap around his entire gelatinous body. - Glitter, a sparkling fuchsia blob that leaves a trail of glitter in her wake, is concocting a shimmery potion in their blobby lab.

He becomes a star, a bird, an intricate flower blooming—all sparkling under Glitter’s magical touch. His performance tells a story of friendship, adventure, and the beauty of being unique. Scene 6: A Standing Ovation - The crowd is mesmerized. As Gloopy finishes with a grand finale—morphing into a replica of Forma-5 itself, surrounded by miniatures of its inhabitants—the audience erupts into a standing ovation. Gloopy’s shapes, combined with Glitter’s effervescence, have created a dazzling spectacle of light and movement. Mayor Dodecy: “Gloopy, your performance was more than art. It was a celebration of what makes each of us unique.” Scene 7: Inspiring a Planet - Inspired by Gloopy, the inhabitants of Forma-5 start experimenting with their own forms of artistic expression beyond color changes. They begin to create sculptures and paintings, trying to capture the essence of Gloopy’s shapeshifting within their static forms. Scene 8: A Heartwarming Farewell - As Gloopy and Glitter prepare to leave, they’re showered with gifts and heartfelt goodbyes. Children mimic Gloopy’s shapes; artists share their Gloopy-inspired art. Gloopy, touched: “I never knew my shapeshifting could bring so much happiness. What an unforgettable experience!” Glitter: “You’ve touched their hearts, Gloopy. Let’s keep spreading joy across the stars.” - They board their blob-mobile, leaving behind a planet now bursting with new forms of expression, a testament to the power of sharing one’s talents. Voiceover: “With Forma-5 in their wake, Gloopy and Glitter continue their cosmic journey, leaving a trail of inspiration and creativity. Wherever they go, they remind us that it’s our unique qualities that truly make us shine.” - The stars twinkle a little brighter as the screen fades to black, the shared laughter of Gloopy and Glitter echoing into the vastness of space. Title: \\"The Mysterious Infinite Mall\\" Scene 1: Glitter’s Mysterious Encounter - Gloopy and Glitter had decided to take a break from their intergalactic adventures and explore a bustling space mall for a change of scenery. As Gloopy headed to the bathroom, Glitter, with her sparkly trail in tow, ventured off on her own. - Lost in the maze-like corridors of the mall, Glitter marveled at the variety of shops and alien species bustling about. Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight – a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself. Alien: “Infinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.” - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: “Excuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‘infinite, forever, never ending’?” Alien (with a hiss): “Ah, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.” - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy’s Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion. Alien Child: “Help us, friendly blob! We can’t find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.” Gloopy: “Don’t worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let’s stick together and find a way out.” Scene 3: A Uniting Force - Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy’s malleable form and the children’s keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks. - Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter’s sparkling trail as a guiding light. - Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite. Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: “You have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.” - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign! Stay toony, and let’s look forward to positive news about our favorite show’s return!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns.

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it! Write a tweet detailing the new schedule, starting by saying it is taking Titans’s slot first, and will later move for Johnny’s slot 🚀 Schedule Swap Alert! 📅 #GoGoRiki is sliding into the “Teen Titans Go!” slot on #CW4Kids, but don’t get too comfy—soon it’ll leapfrog over to Johnny Test’s spot for double the fun! 🌟 Tune in for non-stop laughs and get ready for a whole new wave of toony adventures! 📺😂 #SaturdayMorningLaughs #CW4KidsNewSchedule Write a tweet with the mid-Feburary schedule 🌅 Rise and shine, #CW4Kids fans! 📅 Here’s your MID-FEB lineup: 07:00 Pokemon Indigo League 07:30 GoGoRiki 08:00 Ultimate Muscle 08:30 Code Lyoko 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 10:00 Sonic X 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man This schedule will remain untill mid April, when the new stuff like Viva Pinata (where Xiaolin currently is), TMNT (where Spidey currently is) and Yu-Gi-Oh (where Kirby currently is) come in Your Saturday mornings just got AWESOME! 🎉 #AnimationCelebration CW4Kids ----- CW4Kids is a children’s television programming block on The CW owned-and-operated stations.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB May 2023 Schedule - New Shows & Season Finales!” User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:00 AM Have you all seen the new Kids’ WB lineup that just kicked in this weekend? “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” wrapped up their first seasons, and we’ve got new shows like “World of Quest” and “Skatoony” plus “Ozzy and Drix” returning to the mix. User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up.

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”?

Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come.

User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people!

If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra!

Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills!

User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads!

User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life.

User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content.

Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition.

It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love. CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 PM We’re thrilled you all caught the promo and are excited about the transition!

Can’t wait to see what kind of adventures Pogoriki and pals bring to Saturday mornings! User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on January 2, 2024, at 9:30 AM This totally amps up my excitement for the CW4Kids launch! I’ve always found Pogoriki to be one of the most entertaining characters. Seeing him in action in the promo, even if just for a second, assures me that “GoGoRiki” is going to inject some serious fun into the lineup. CW4Kids is pulling out all the stops! User4: RetroRewind Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:00 AM Pogoriki? That’s fantastic news! Such a clever way to announce “GoGoRiki” without explicitly saying it. I’ve missed the humor and vibrant animation style of the show. Looks like CW4Kids isn’t just holding onto legacies; they’re really embracing new tales and characters. Kudos to the team for the smart reveal! User5: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:30 AM DetectiveToon, your investigative skills are top-notch! A cameo by Pogoriki is a promising nod to the humor and whimsy we can expect from CW4Kids. It’s comforting to see a blend of nostalgia with new introductions. “GoGoRiki” fans, prepare for laughter and escapades with the rabbit that has charmed so many! User6: AnimationAficionado Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM Absolutely thrilling detective work! “GoGoRiki” entering CW4Kids could signify a stronger focus on family-friendly comedy and adventures.

User1: DetectiveToon Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:45 AM Hey @CW4KidsForumMod, out of curiosity and just for clarity, which company do you officially represent here in the forum? Is it Warner Bros, still overseeing some parts of CW4Kids during this transitional period, or are you directly with 4Kids Entertainment now? The blend of old and new has been fascinating, and I’m just trying to understand from whose perspective we’re seeing these exciting updates! 🙂 CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hi @DetectiveToon, great question! I’m here representing 4Kids Entertainment. While we’re currently in the midst of this transitional period and working closely with Warner Bros to ensure a smooth handover for CW4Kids, my role is to directly engage with and update our amazing community on behalf of 4Kids Entertainment.

Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hey, @SquishSuperFan and everyone else feeling the ‘Squish’ blues! We appreciate your passion for the show and understand your disappointment. Our goal at CW4Kids is to create a diverse and dynamic viewing experience that resonates with our audience’s evolving tastes. While there are no current plans to bring back ‘Squish’, we’re always evaluating our lineup to ensure it delivers the best in animated entertainment. Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we navigate this exciting chapter for CW4Kids! Write a reply from the mod suggesting some alternatives, and saying while the show won’t return anytime soon, here’s some other great stuff CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:30 PM Hey @SquishSuperFan and all our dedicated viewers, I totally hear you on missing ‘Squish’ and the unique flavor it brought to our lineup. While it’s true that ‘Squish’ won’t be returning anytime soon, we’re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in ‘Squish’. For those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I’d highly recommend giving “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a shot. It’s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table. Another show that’s been a hit among our audience is “GoGoRiki.” Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers. And, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” has been making waves. It introduces fresh adventures and characters that continue to expand the beloved Pokemon universe. We understand that while these alternatives may not replace ‘Squish’, they represent the diverse and entertaining content CW4Kids strives to deliver. Our goal is to fill your Saturday mornings with stories that make you laugh, think, and dream. Thank you again for your understanding, enthusiasm, and support.

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show’s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this? User2: ToonAdventurer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM I saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that “The lab is now closing” message. The alternatives suggested were “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic,” right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” but it’s a good nudge to explore the new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM Certainly a creative way to say goodbye to “Johnny Test” and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on—futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel’s new direction perfectly. I’ve been a fan of “Johnny Test” for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give “GoGoRiki” a shot next Saturday! User4: NewEraToonGoer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. “Johnny Test” has been a staple, but the ad’s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” caught my eye; it has that quirky charm “Johnny Test” fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites. User5: DigitalCartoonDiva Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM That “The lab is now closing” ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids’ commitment to its new era. “Viva Pinata” and “Chaotic” seem like they’ll fill the action-comedy void left by “Johnny Test.” Excited to see what these shows have to offer! User6: RetroToonLover Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM The farewell ad for “Johnny Test” was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they’re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. “Johnny Test” will be missed, but the network’s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle. Here’s to new adventures! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:45 PM It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to bid farewell to “Johnny Test.” The “lab is now closing” ad was our way of softly transitioning fans towards our exciting new lineup, rendered in our fresh presentational style.

Gloopy did a fantastic job hosting, giving us insights and laughter throughout.

It seems like a big move, but is it just the tip of the iceberg? What’s everyone’s take? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on April 25, 2024, at 9:50 AM I was thinking the same thing, @ToonTalkerTim! The swap from “Tomodachi Life” to “Gloopy and Glitter” is significant, no doubt. But given the momentum CW4Kids and now 4Kids TV have been carrying, I wouldn’t be surprised if there are more surprises waiting in the wings for May. It feels like a season of transformation for them. User3: DigitalDawn Posted on April 25, 2024, at 10:15 AM You’ve got a point there. Given the major overhaul CW4Kids has undergone, it wouldn’t shock me if 4Kids TV followed suit with its own set of changes this May. It’s all about keeping the content fresh and engaging, after all. Maybe they’ll introduce more interactive content or exclusive online shows to complement “Gloopy and Glitter”? User4: RetroToonRanger Posted on April 25, 2024, at 10:40 AM Given that “Gloopy and Glitter” got its own dedicated ad mentioning the swap happening on May 1st, it’s clear they’re putting considerable thought into this transition.

The formula is given by: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r Where: U = potential energy k = Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2) q1 = charge of the nucleus (in this case, z protons) q2 = charge of the electron (1.6 x 10^-19 C) r = distance between the nucleus and the electron Since the electron is in orbit around the nucleus, we can assume that the distance r is approximately the Bohr radius (a0 = 5.29 x 10^-11 m). Plugging in the values, the formula becomes: U = (8.99 x 10^9) * (z * 1.6 x 10^-19) / (5.29 x 10^-11) Solving this equation will give you the potential energy experienced by the electron due to the nucleus with z protons."},{"prompt":"how to convert force to energy","completion":"To convert force to energy, you need to consider the distance over which the force is acting. The amount of work done, or energy transferred, by a force acting over a particular distance is given by the formula: Work (energy) = Force * Distance * cos(theta) Where: - Work (energy) is measured in joules (J) - Force is measured in newtons (N) - Distance is measured in meters (m) - Theta is the angle between the force vector and the displacement vector. If the force is acting in the same direction as the displacement, theta = 0 and cos(theta) = 1. If the force is perpendicular to the displacement, theta = 90° and cos(theta) = 0. If the force is constant over the distance, you can simply multiply the force by the distance to get the energy. If the force is not constant, you may need to use integration to calculate the total energy transferred. It's important to note that force and energy are not directly convertible units, as they represent different physical quantities. Force is a measure of the interaction between objects, while energy is a measure of the ability to perform work or cause a change in a system. The conversion from force to energy requires consideration of the displacement over which the force is applied."},{"prompt":"3. The Bohr atom was one of the first attempts to make a quantum mechanical description of a hydrogenic atom.

(b) Use Newton’s second law to get one expression relating the velocity and the radius of the circular electron motion.","completion":"(a) To find the total energy E of the electron in a circular orbit around a nucleus with charge Ze, we can consider the electrostatic potential energy and kinetic energy of the electron: Electrostatic potential energy (U): The electrostatic potential energy between the electron and nucleus is given by: U = -k * (Ze * e) / r Kinetic energy (K): The kinetic energy of the electron is given by: K = 0.5 * m * v^2 Where: - k is Coulomb's constant (8.99 x 10^9 N m^2/C^2) - Ze is the charge of the nucleus (in terms of the elementary charge e) - e is the charge of a proton (1.6 x 10^-19 C) - r is the radius of the circular orbit - m is the mass of the electron - v is the velocity of the electron in the orbit The total energy E of the electron is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies: E = K + U Substitute the expressions for U and K into the total energy equation to get the total energy E in terms of r and v. (b) Using Newton's second law, the centripetal force required to keep the electron in a circular motion is provided by the electrostatic force between the electron and the nucleus.

Compare them to the energies predicted for the quantum mechanical hydrogenic atom that we did in class. Show how they agree or not?","completion":"The quantized energies that emerge from the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom are given by the formula: En = - [ (k^2 * Z^2 * e^4) / (2 * n^2 * h^2) ] Where: - En is the energy of the electron in the nth orbit - k is Coulomb's constant - Z is the atomic number (number of protons) - e is the elementary charge - n is the principal quantum number - h is the Planck constant In the Bohr model, the energy levels are quantized and decrease as the electron transitions to lower energy levels. The energy levels in the Bohr model are discrete and inversely proportional to the square of the principal quantum number (n). In the quantum mechanical hydrogenic atom, the energies predicted by the Schrödinger equation are given by the formula: En = - [ (Z^2 * e^4) / (2 * n^2 * h^2 * ε0^2) ] Where ε0 is the permittivity of free space. Comparing the two formulas, we see that the energies in the Bohr model contain the additional factor of Coulomb's constant squared (k^2) in the numerator and do not include the permittivity term ε0^2 present in the quantum mechanical hydrogenic atom calculations. When comparing the quantized energies predicted by the two models, we find that the Bohr model energies are similar to the quantum mechanical energies but do not account for the quantum-mechanical concepts such as wave-particle duality and the quantization of angular momentum. While the Bohr model successfully predicts energy levels for hydrogenic atoms to an extent, the quantum mechanical model provides a more accurate and comprehensive description of the hydrogen atom, explaining phenomena such as electron diffraction, atomic spectra, and electron cloud distribution."},{"prompt":"How was the bohr model ernergy calculated?","completion":"In the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, the energy levels of the electron are calculated based on the assumptions proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913. One of the key assumptions of the Bohr model is that the electron orbits the nucleus in circular orbits and that the angular momentum of the electron is quantized. The energy of the electron in the nth orbit in the Bohr model is calculated using the following formula: En = - [ (k^2 * Z^2 * e^4) / (2 * n^2 * h^2) ] Where: - En is the energy of the electron in the nth orbit - k is Coulomb's constant - Z is the atomic number (number of protons) - e is the elementary charge - n is the principal quantum number - h is the Planck constant The negative sign indicates that the energy of the electron in the orbit is bound (i.e., it requires energy to remove the electron from the atom). The energy levels in the Bohr model are quantized, meaning that the electron can only occupy certain discrete energy levels corresponding to different orbits around the nucleus. Bohr's model introduced the concept of quantized angular momentum (mvr = nħ, where n is the principal quantum number and ħ is the reduced Planck constant) and considered the centripetal force provided by the electrostatic attraction between the electron and the nucleus. By balancing the electrostatic attraction and the centrifugal force due to the orbiting electron, Bohr derived the expression for the energy levels in the hydrogen atom. It's important to note that while the Bohr model provided valuable insights into the quantization of energy levels in the hydrogen atom, it is a semiclassical model and does not fully capture the wave-particle duality and other quantum mechanical phenomena observed in atoms. The later development of quantum mechanics provided a more comprehensive understanding of atomic structure and spectra."},{"prompt":"Напиши німецькою розповідь про Великдень. Хз, якісь факти.

Ostern fällt immer auf einen Sonntag, das Datum ändert sich jedoch jedes Jahr. In der Ukraine folgen viele Menschen dem julianischen Kalender, daher fällt ihr Osterfest oft auf ein anderes Datum als in Ländern, die den gregorianischen Kalender verwenden. Die Vorbereitung auf Ostern beginnt lange vor dem Fest. Eine Woche vor Ostern nennt man die Karwoche. In dieser Zeit besuchen viele Menschen die Kirche, um an den Gottesdiensten teilzunehmen. Eines der bekanntesten Osterbräuche in der Ukraine ist das Färben von Eiern, die sogenannten Pysanky. Diese Eier werden nicht nur einfach gefärbt, sondern kunstvoll mit traditionellen Mustern und Symbolen verziert. Jedes Symbol hat seine eigene Bedeutung, wie zum Beispiel Gesundheit, Fruchtbarkeit oder Schutz. Am Ostersamstag bringen die Menschen Körbe mit Essen in die Kirche, um sie segnen zu lassen. Diese Körbe enthalten oft Pysanky, ein spezielles Osterbrot namens Paska, Wurst, Butter, Käse und andere Lebensmittel. Nach dem Gottesdienst setzen sich Familien zusammen und genießen das gesegnete Essen. Eine andere Tradition ist das Osterspiel \\"Haievidky\\", bei dem Kinder von Haus zu Haus gehen, Lieder singen und dabei von den Hausbewohnern mit Eiern, Süßigkeiten oder kleinen Geldbeträgen belohnt werden.

Великдень завжди припадає на неділю, проте дата змінюється щороку. В Україні багато людей дотримуються юліанського календаря, тому їхній Великдень часто припадає на іншу дату, ніж у країнах, які використовують григоріанський календар. Підготовка до Великодня починається задовго до свята. Тиждень перед Великоднем називають Страсним тижнем. Цього часу багато людей відвідують церкву, щоб брати участь у богослужіннях. Однією з найвідоміших великодніх традицій в Україні є фарбування яєць, так звані писанки. Ці яйця не просто фарбують, а вправно прикрашають традиційними візерунками та символами. Кожен символ має своє значення, наприклад, здоров’я, плодючість або захист. У Велику суботу люди несуть кошики з їжею в церкву, щоб їх освятити. У цих кошиках часто бувають писанки, спеціальний великодній хліб, який називається паска, ковбаса, масло, сир та інші продукти. Після служби сім’ї збираються разом і насолоджуються освяченою їжею. Інша традиція – великодній обряд \\"Гаївки\\", під час якого діти ходять від дому до дому, співають пісні, а господарі обдаровують їх яйцями, солодощами або невеликими сумами грошей. Великдень – це також час згуртованості, відродження та надії. Це свято, яке виходить за межі релігійного значення та збирає разом людей, щоб відзначити прихід весни та повернення життя.

We'll proceed with a hypothetical (K_f = 1) for demonstration, but **you should replace this value** with the one you determine based on your Nyquist plot analysis and stability requirements. # b) Plot the Step Response and Pole-Zero Map of (tilde{G}(s)) With a chosen (K_f), you can now analyze (tilde{G}(s)). \`\`\`matlab % Assuming we have chosen a Kf value (this should be determined based on your Nyquist plot analysis) Kf = 1; % Placeholder, adjust based on your analysis G_tilde = feedback(Kf*G, 1); % Step response of G_tilde figure; step(G_tilde); title('Step Response of tilde{G}(s)'); % Pole-zero map of G_tilde figure; pzmap(G_tilde); title('Pole-Zero Map of tilde{G}(s)'); \`\`\` # c) Checking Stability The step response and pole-zero map provide insights into the system's stability: - **Step response:** Look for a bounded output that settles to a steady value without sustained oscillations. - **Pole-zero map:** All poles should be in the left-half-plane (LHP) for the system to be considered stable. Any poles in the right-half-plane (RHP) indicate instability. This step in the process is critical for verifying that your chosen (K_f) indeed makes (tilde{G}(s)) stable. Depending on the results, you may need to adjust (K_f) accordingly and repeat the analysis. It's important to note that the process of determining (K_f) can be more systematic by applying specific control design criteria or optimization techniques, but that would require a more in-depth analysis beyond the scope of a direct answer here. For the specific criteria given in Task 2(c) such as overshoot, settling time, or steady-state error, you would need to analyze the step response quantitatively, adjusting (K_f) and potentially the structure of your compensator based on these performance metrics. MATLAB's \`stepinfo\` function can be useful for extracting these performance parameters from the step response."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Utilizing AI to assist with writing research papers offers numerous benefits, from generating ideas to ensuring grammatical correctness and even ensuring the writing is in line with academic standards. Several tools have been designed to cater to these needs. While the idea of AI writing a research paper entirely on its own raises ethical and academic integrity concerns, using AI tools to aid in the research and writing process is increasingly common. Here are some prominent AI-powered tools that can help with different aspects of writing a research paper: 1. **Grammarly**: Primarily, a tool for grammar checking, plagiarism detection, and suggestions on writing style improvements. Grammarly uses AI to help writers produce mistake-free writing. They offer both free and premium plans, which makes it accessible for students and researchers on a budget. 2. **QuillBot**: It is an AI writing and research tool that offers paraphrasing features, ensuring your writing is original and plagiarism-free. QuillBot includes a grammar checker, summarizer, and a citation generator which can be very useful for academic writing. QuillBot has a free version with limited features, and a premium subscription for more advanced needs. 3. **SciSpace (formerly Typeset.io)**: While not directly helping with the writing, SciSpace aids researchers in formatting their papers according to various journal and conference guidelines, making submission-ready documents. It also integrates with reference management tools and provides features for collaborative writing. SciSpace offers a free version with basic features. 4. **GPT-3 (and its derivatives from OpenAI)**: This powerful AI has the capability to generate human-like text based on prompts given to it. While directly using GPT-3 to write a research paper might not be advisable due to concerns over originality and authenticity, it can be extremely useful for brainstorming, generating outlines, or overcoming writer's block. Access to GPT-3 usually comes through interfaces and platforms that utilize its API, some of which may offer free usage tiers. 5. **Zotero and Mendeley**: While not AI in the strictest sense, these tools use intelligent features to manage references, citations, and PDFs. They can automatically extract metadata from documents, assist in organizing research materials, and generate citations in a wide variety of styles. Both Zotero and Mendeley offer free plans to users. When using AI tools for academic writing, it's crucial to remember that the integrity and originality of your work are paramount. These tools should be used to assist in the process rather than completely outsourcing the intellectual effort. Always review and critically assess the input and output of AI tools, ensuring the final work is genuinely reflective of your knowledge and understanding of the subject matter."},{"prompt":"\\"oi pessoal\\" why uses pessoal and not pessoas or pessoa?","completion":"\\"Oi pessoal\\" translates to \\"Hi, everyone\\" or \\"Hi, folks\\" in English.

However, its use in patients with hypertension requires careful consideration. Patients with hypertension should be closely monitored when taking etoricoxib, especially at doses of 60 mg and 90 mg, as it can potentially elevate blood pressure in some individuals. This effect is a class effect of COX-2 inhibitors and nonselective NSAIDs. For a 56-year-old patient with hypertension, here are several key considerations: 1. **Blood Pressure Monitoring**: The patient's blood pressure should be well-controlled and monitored closely after initiating etoricoxib treatment, especially within the first few weeks or when adjusting the dose. 2. **Cardiovascular Risk**: Etoricoxib, like other NSAIDs, may increase the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events, especially in patients with existing cardiovascular disease or significant cardiovascular risk factors. Though this patient's primary concern is hypertension, the overall cardiovascular risk profile should be assessed. 3. **Dose Consideration**: For pain relief in the context of a herniated disc, the typical dose of etoricoxib is 60 mg or 90 mg once daily. The lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration necessary to control symptoms. 4. **Alternative Pain Management Strategies**: Depending on the severity of the herniated disc and the patient's overall health status, it may be beneficial to consider other pain management strategies in conjunction with, or instead of, etoricoxib. These can include physical therapy, weight management (if applicable), other types of pain medication, and in some cases, surgical intervention. 5. **Interaction with Other Medications**: It's important to consider any other medications the patient is taking, as etoricoxib can interact with various drugs, including antihypertensives, affecting their efficacy. Given these considerations, the decision to prescribe etoricoxib for a patient with hypertension and a herniated disc should be made on an individual basis, assessing the benefits against the potential risks. The healthcare provider should also ensure ongoing monitoring and support for the patient, adjusting treatment as necessary to manage both conditions effectively. Lastly, it's crucial for patients to communicate openly with their healthcare providers about all medications they're taking, their blood pressure control, and any side effects they may experience while on etoricoxib or any other treatment."},{"prompt":"So which better celecoxib or naproxen 750mg?","completion":"When comparing Celecoxib and Naproxen for treating conditions that require anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving medication, the choice between the two depends on various factors including the patient's overall health, risk factors for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events, and the specific condition being treated. Let's explore these factors in the context of their use: # Celecoxib - **Type**: A selective COX-2 inhibitor - **Cardiovascular Risks**: Generally considered to have a lower risk of causing gastrointestinal bleeding than nonselective NSAIDs like naproxen but may still present a risk for cardiovascular events, especially at higher doses or in patients with existing cardiovascular disease. - **Gastrointestinal (GI) Safety**: Considered to have a more favorable GI side effect profile due to its selectivity for the COX-2 enzyme, which means it is less likely to cause stomach ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding compared to nonselective NSAIDs. - **Use**: Effective for pain relief, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and other inflammatory conditions. Its safety profile makes it a preferred choice for patients at high risk of GI complications but with no high cardiovascular risks. # Naproxen - **Type**: A nonselective NSAID - **Cardiovascular Risks**: All NSAIDs can potentially increase the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events, such as heart attack or stroke. However, naproxen is often considered to have a lower cardiovascular risk profile compared to some other NSAIDs. - **Gastrointestinal (GI) Safety**: Naproxen, like other nonselective NSAIDs, is more likely to cause gastrointestinal issues such as ulcers and bleeding than selective COX-2 inhibitors like celecoxib. - **Use**: It is effective for a wide range of conditions, including acute pain, inflammation, gout attacks, and menstrual cramps. Due to its potential for GI side effects, it may not be the preferred choice for patients at high risk of GI bleeding. # Choosing Between Celecoxib and Naproxen The decision on whether to use celecoxib or naproxen should be based on: - **Patient's History of Cardiovascular Disease**: For patients with a high risk of cardiovascular events, careful consideration is required. Naproxen has been suggested in some studies to have a less adverse effect on cardiovascular risk compared to other NSAIDs, including possibly celecoxib. - **GI Risk Profile**: Celecoxib may be better for those at high risk for GI side effects. - **Effectiveness for the Specific Condition**: Depending on the condition being treated, one may be more effective than the other. - **Patient's Other Medical Conditions and Medications**: Interactions with other medications and the overall health status may make one drug more appropriate than the other. - **Patient Preference and Previous Response**: Patient experience and response to medication can also guide the choice. It's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new medication, including celecoxib or naproxen, to discuss individual risk factors and conditions to determine the most appropriate and safe option."},{"prompt":"torque vs momentum in details and examples","completion":"Torque and momentum are fundamental concepts in physics, particularly within the realms of rotational motion for torque and linear and angular motion for momentum. Understanding these concepts is crucial for grasping the principles that govern the behavior of objects in motion, whether they're spinning tops, orbiting planets, or vehicles in motion. Let's delve into each concept in detail, including examples to illustrate their applications. # Torque **Definition**: Torque, often referred to as the moment of force, measures the tendency of a force to rotate an object about an axis, fulcrum, or pivot. It's a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. Torque is calculated as the product of the force applied and the lever arm distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force acts. **Formula**: Torque (τ) = Force (F) × Lever Arm Distance (r) In vector notation, torque is the cross product of the lever-arm vector and the force vector: τ = r × F **Examples**: 1. **Wrench**: When you use a wrench to tighten a bolt, you're applying torque to the bolt. The amount of torque depends on how much force you apply to the wrench and the length of the wrench. A longer wrench requires less force to achieve the same amount of torque because the lever arm distance is greater. 2. **Door**: Opening a door involves applying torque. The farther you push from the hinge (axis of rotation), the easier it is to open the door because the lever arm distance increases, thus requiring less force to exert the same torque. # Momentum **Types**: There are two main types of momentum: linear momentum and angular momentum. 1. **Linear Momentum** is the product of an object's mass and its velocity. It's a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. It's a measure of an object's motion in a straight line. **Formula**: Linear Momentum (p) = Mass (m) × Velocity (v) 2. **Angular Momentum** relates to objects in rotational motion and is the product of an object's moment of inertia (a measure of how much resistance it offers to rotational acceleration) and its angular velocity. **Formula**: Angular Momentum (L) = Moment of Inertia (I) × Angular Velocity (ω) **Examples**: 1. **Moving Vehicle**: A car driving down the road has linear momentum proportional to its mass and velocity. The greater the vehicle's mass or the higher its speed, the more momentum it has. This is why heavier or faster vehicles are harder to stop. 2. **Spinning Figure Skater**: A figure skater spinning on ice exhibits angular momentum. When the skater pulls their arms in close to their body, they reduce their moment of inertia but spin faster to conserve angular momentum. This illustrates the conservation of angular momentum: as the moment of inertia decreases, angular velocity increases. # Key Differences: - **Nature of Motion**: Torque deals with rotational force and its ability to cause changes in the rotational motion of an object. In contrast, momentum (linear and angular) is a property of moving objects, whether they're moving in a straight line or rotating. - **Conservation**: Angular momentum is conserved in a system where there is no external torque, similar to how linear momentum is conserved in the absence of external forces. Torque, however, is not a conserved quantity but rather a measure of rotational effect produced by a force. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for solving problems in physics, especially in mechanics, where rotational and translational movements are involved. Each concept brings an essential perspective to the analysis of motion."},{"prompt":"Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Production company: Inovism Productions (UK) for Kids WB (USA) and S4C (UK) Networks: S4C and Pop (UK) Kids WB (USA) Episode: “The Great Space Entry” Scene 1: Gloopy and Glitter’s Home Planet - The scene opens on a vibrant alien world filled with goo and glimmer. - Gloopy, the laid-back teal blob with a charming smile, is listening to spaced-out tunes with headphones that wrap around his entire gelatinous body. - Glitter, a sparkling fuchsia blob that leaves a trail of glitter in her wake, is concocting a shimmery potion in their blobby lab.

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give 'em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.' User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task.

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados! Got the latest scoop on the Kids’ WB October 2022 schedule. We’ve got classics and new hits on the list, but word on the street is “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” might be gone by mid-2023! What do you think about the current lineup and the future changes? User2: CartoonCatcher Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:12 PM Oh wow, really? Both “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have a solid fan base. That’s going to be a big shake-up! Here’s what I’ve got for October’s schedule: 07:00 The Amazing World of Gumball 07:30 Teen Titans Go! 08:00 Craig of the Creek 08:30 Xiaolin Showdown 09:00 Code Lyoko 09:30 Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated 10:00 Batman: The Brave and the Bold 10:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter 11:00 Johnny Test 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man Some solid programming right there! “Gumball” is my go-to for laughs in the morning. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal. Start saying your goodbyes to what Kids’ WB was, and let’s get ready for a new chapter. Whatever happens, we’ve got to support our favorite morning block. Can’t wait to see what’s next!

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals! CW4Kids aims for that perfect Saturday morning mix every week. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are our latest contributions to keep you entertained. Remember to tune in next week for more animated adventures. And let’s not forget “Gloopy and Glitter”—those blobs are something else! User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right! Write a follow up where 1 new bumper is added to the set (normally the comic bumpers feature characters from Squish, TTG and Johnny Test), state which 3 shows this bumper has Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Bumper Update – A New Addition Joins the Mix!” User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:00 AM Hey, fellow cartoon connoisseurs! Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up. Plus, seeing “Gloopy and Glitter” featured tells us they’re betting on the blobby duo. Exciting times ahead!

December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra! Extra!/The Magic Trick/Treasure Hunt/The Forgotten Memory (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:00 Ultimate Muscle: Making The Cut (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 08:30 Code Lyoko: Guided Missile - 09:00 Xiaolin Showdown: Finding Omi - 09:30 The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: The Barren Planet of Shadows/Lost in Gloopiter - 10:00 Sonic X: Satellite Swindle (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 10:30 Kirby: Right Back At Ya: Un-Reality TV (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 11:00 Johnny Test: Johnny To The Centre of the Earth/Phat Johnny - 11:30 Ultimate Spider-Man: Why I Hate Gym Forum Thread Title: “The Shift to CW4KIDS.tv - Observing Website Updates & Pokémon Episode Airings” User1: WebWizKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:47 AM Have you all checked out cw4kids.com lately? Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn't confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn't World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn't premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu's Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are!

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Moderator: CW4KidsChampion Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:30 PM Remember guys, while change is a constant, our love for classic toons remains unwavering. ‘Johnny Test’ will always be a part of our beloved cartoon history. Meanwhile, let’s celebrate our top-rated shows—they’re shaping the new legacy of CW4Kids. Keep the conversations and your passion for the toons flowing! User6: AnimationAnalyst Posted on May 12, 2024, at 7:00 PM I’m all for the new wave of shows, but it’s nice to see how ‘Code Lyoko’ continues to capture hearts—even amidst all the flashy newcomers. As the rebrand becomes the norm, I wonder if it’ll maintain its place in the top five. But yes, definitely a moment of silence for our pal Johnny.

We’re getting “GoGoRiki,” “Kirby: Right Back At Ya,” and “Ultimate Muscle” making their debuts! 🎉 And here’s a bit you’ll REALLY find interesting, especially if you were a Kids WB regular late last year: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are coming back!

Shows there’s a commitment to reviving beloved series alongside introducing new ones. User3: RetroToonRetro Posted on February 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back is a major win for fans of the original run. “GoGoRiki” sounds like it could add some quirky humor to the mix.

Balancing nostalgia with new content could be the key to keeping both old fans and enticing new ones. User5: DigitalDawn Posted on February 1, 2024, at 11:15 AM Honestly, it’s smart of CW4Kids to sprinkle in some modern-nostalgia with “Gloopy and Glitter.” Brings a sense of continuity. “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” are classics that deserve more love, and “GoGoRiki” could be the dark horse that surprises us all. This lineup feels like a rebirth while tipping its hat to its roots. Can’t wait! Moderator: CW4KidsCaretaker Posted on February 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for our upcoming late-winter lineup and the return of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”!

Also, here's the Kids WB ratings from early December Final K6-11 Ratings for Saturday, December 2, 2023 Broadcast Networks only (Live + SD Data): CW (Kids' WB!) (7a-12p) Squish 0.7, Teen Titans Go 1.6, Xiaolin Showdown 1.0, Ultimate Spider-Man 0.9, Code Lyoko 2.0, Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated 1.2, Batman: The Brave and the Bold 1.6, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers 1.2, Johnny Test 1.8, The Hollow 0.9 Forum Thread Title: “From Kids’ WB to CW4Kids – A Ratings Comparison” User1: ToonDataDiver Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:15 AM I’ve been tracking the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids closely, particularly in terms of ratings. Interestingly, some shows remain strong, like “Johnny Test” (still with us until April) showing consistent appeal. Here’s a quick comparison with early March data after the transition: CW4Kids (March 2, 2024) (Live + SD Data): - Pokémon: Indigo League: 1.9 - GoGoRiki: 1.4 - Ultimate Muscle: 1.3 - Code Lyoko: 2.3 - Xiaolin Showdown: 1.2 - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: 1.8 - Sonic X: 2.0 - Kirby: Right Back At Ya!: 1.5 - Johnny Test: 1.7 - Ultimate Spider-Man: 1.1 User2: RetroToonNostalgia Posted on March 4, 2024, at 9:45 AM Fascinating to see how the ratings have evolved! Looks like “Code Lyoko” is pulling even stronger numbers now, possibly benefiting from the transition. And “Sonic X” stepping up is no surprise given its restart from Episode 1. Shame “Johnny Test” is on its way out considering its solid ratings. It brought much-needed humor and continuity during the shake-up. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:05 AM I’m impressed by how well CW4Kids has managed to hold and even grow the ratings for some of these shows. “Code Lyoko’s” jump is particularly noteworthy; it seems to resonate even more with the audience after the transition. It’s bittersweet, though, regarding “Johnny Test” - it’s been a staple, and seeing it maintain strong ratings till its end is a testament to its lasting appeal. User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 4, 2024, at 10:30 AM The transition strategy from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids seems to be paying off. Shows like “Pokémon: Indigo League” gaining traction is indicative of smart programming choices that cater not just to nostalgia but to new viewers. Also, the introduction of “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” is filling in the comedic gap left by “Johnny Test” pretty well, judging by their ratings. User5: TooniverseTrekker Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s intriguing to contrast these ratings. “Johnny Test” has indeed shown impressive resilience through the transition. It’s a shame we’re seeing it go, but the newfound strength in others, especially “Code Lyoko” and newcomers like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X,” suggests CW4Kids is shaping a robust new identity that still honors the legacy of engaging Saturday morning cartoons. User6: ModernToonMaster Posted on March 4, 2024, at 11:30 AM True, the increase in ratings for “Code Lyoko” and the successful introduction of refreshes like “Pokémon: Indigo League” speak volumes. While it’s a fond farewell to “Johnny Test,” the data hints at CW4Kids’ potential to not only sustain but perhaps exceed the engagement Kids’ WB enjoyed. Here’s looking forward to seeing how they continue evolving. Moderator: CW4KidsForumMod Posted on March 4, 2024, at 12:00 PM Appreciating the analytical dive into the ratings, everyone! It’s always a challenge to evolve a programming block while keeping the essence that audiences love. The transition period has been handled with the audience in mind, aiming to blend legacy shows with new blood. While we’re indeed saying goodbye to “Johnny Test,” the strength in our current lineup points to a bright future for CW4Kids! Stay tuned as we keep aiming to captivate and entertain every Saturday morning. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Final Days & The CW4Kids Transition: What to Expect” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:00 AM So, looks like the Jan 6 schedule for our beloved Kids’ WB isn’t changing at all from what we have now. Seems a bit too quiet for a transition, don’t you think? However, don’t be fooled folks! Word on the street is “GoGoRiki” will make its grand entrance in just a few weeks under the new CW4Kids banner. Any thoughts? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:30 AM Yeah, I was a bit surprised to see the Jan 6 schedule looking so…familiar. But knowing that “GoGoRiki” is on the horizon has me intrigued. It feels like CW4Kids is giving us a soft start before they fully unveil what’s really coming. It’s interesting to see how they’re balancing the old with the new during this transition. User3: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:00 AM I noticed that too! Keeping the schedule unchanged for Jan 6 seems to be a strategic move to ease us into the transition phase. “GoGoRiki” feels like it’ll be the first big test of whether CW4Kids can carry on the Saturday morning tradition we all love. Can’t wait to see how it plays out! User4: AnimationInsider Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 AM This gradual shift strategy is interesting. By not shaking up the Jan 6 schedule too much, they’re likely trying to not rock the boat for viewers who are still adjusting to the CW4Kids idea. But really, I’m looking forward to seeing what “GoGoRiki” brings to the table. It’s going to set the tone for what’s to come under CW4Kids. User5: ModernToonMaster Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 AM I get why they’re doing it, but part of me wishes they’d just rip off the band-aid and bring in the new lineup immediately. That said, introducing “GoGoRiki” is a smart move to start off with, considering its appeal. I’m curious how they’ll balance new shows with the legacy of Kids’ WB. User6: CuriousCartoonist Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:30 AM Quick question for @CW4KidsForumMod - With this soft transition and Warner still seemingly having some control for now, are you currently operating under Warner or 4Kids? And when can we expect to see this handover of control reflected in the programming and overall direction of CW4Kids? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 12:00 PM Great question, @CuriousCartoonist. For the moment, Warner Bros is indeed overseeing the transitional period of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids alongside 4Kids Entertainment. This partnership ensures a smooth transition while maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday mornings special for our audience. Rest assured, as we move deeper into 2024, you’ll start to see more of 4Kids’ influence in the programming, ushering in new and exciting changes. And yes, “GoGoRiki” is just the beginning! Stay tuned, and thanks for your patience during this exciting time. Write a follow up on January 9 where users are speculating on when GoGoRiki will premiere, and what show it will replace on the lineup, Also by the end of this thread, the Jan 27 schedule is revealed, with Pokemon and Sonic X replacing Squish and Adrenalini, No GoGoRiki yet, but it’s definitely coming on Feb 17, when 4Kids start programming the block, but the presentation (idents, promos) will remain the same till after Easter Forum Thread Title: “GoGoRiki Premiere Speculations & CW4Kids Programming Changes” User1: ToonWatcher101 Posted on January 9, 2024, at 8:57 AM Hey gang! With the buzz around “GoGoRiki” joining CW4Kids, any guesses on when it’ll premiere and which show it might end up replacing? Given the transition, it’s hard to pin down exactly when and what changes will come. Thoughts? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on January 9, 2024, at 9:34 AM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” swooping in sometime mid-February. As for which show it’ll replace, my money’s on something less popular or maybe a show that’s already seen its completion. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” or “Squish” might be on the chopping block. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 9, 2024, at 10:15 AM There’s chatter that “GoGoRiki” will premiere February 17, right when 4Kids begins programming the block. Makes sense for a smooth transition, introducing a fresh face while maintaining the current essence of the lineup. Plus, I heard “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are joining soon, which is super exciting! User4: ToonTimeTerry Posted on January 9, 2024, at 11:05 AM Just saw the announcement for the January 27 schedule! “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” No sign of “GoGoRiki” yet, but February 17 looks like a solid bet for its debut. Seems like 4Kids is keen on keeping things interesting! User5: AnimationAdmirer Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:00 PM Fascinating developments! “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” are classics, and their addition could hint at the direction CW4Kids is headed under 4Kids’ influence. “GoGoRiki” not premiering until February 17 suggests 4Kids is slowly molding the block with its signature. I’m here for it! User6: RetroToonRanger Posted on January 9, 2024, at 12:45 PM A little sad to see “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, but the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” on January 27 is a welcome surprise! As for “GoGoRiki,” waiting until February 17 seems strategic, allowing viewers to adjust. Eager to see how this shapes the CW4Kids landscape. User7: DigitalCartoonist Posted on January 9, 2024, at 1:30 PM Speculating about “GoGoRiki” has been quite the pastime! Mid-February gives CW4Kids a moment to breathe and integrate “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” seamlessly. Really optimistic about the direction we’re heading. Plus, keeping presentations consistent post-Easter shows they’re prioritizing a smooth viewer transition. Smart move! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 9, 2024, at 2:00 PM Appreciate all the speculation and feedback, folks! The decision to bring in “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” on January 27, then debut “GoGoRiki” on February 17, is part of our broader strategy to gradually introduce changes and new content, ensuring the audience gets the best of both worlds—nostalgia and novelty. Rest assured, presentations such as idents and promos will retain their familiar feel until after Easter to help ease the transition. Stay tuned, and thanks for your engagement and excitement during this transformative period for CW4Kids!

It was a nostalgic trip seeing all the current shows celebrated one last time under the Kids’ WB banner. But that ending – they gave us a peek at a new show! Looked exciting but they only teased “Coming Soon” under CW4Kids. Any guesses on what it could be? User2: FutureToonFan Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:25 PM Caught it! That teaser at the end has my mind racing. Could be the rumored “GoGoRiki” finally making its debut? The clip was too brief to make out much, but the excitement is real. It’s a clever way to keep us hooked for the CW4Kids rebrand. User3: NostalgiaNerd Posted on December 30, 2023, at 9:40 PM I’m betting on “GoGoRiki” too, given the chatter. But leaving us with just a “Coming Soon” cliffhanger? Classic move to keep us on our toes. The transition feels like the end of an era, yet that teaser has me hopeful for what CW4Kids is cooking up. User4: SaturdaySleuth Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:05 PM That final promo was a mixed bag of emotions – a goodbye paired with a hint of new beginnings. Agree on the “GoGoRiki” speculation; it fits with what’s been floating around. Either way, CW4Kids is setting the stage for some fresh content while paying homage to Kids’ WB’s legacy. User5: ToonTimeTim Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:30 PM It really hit me when they said, “It’s the same great Kids WB, just under a new name.” But that sneak peek at the end? Genius way to transition. Whether it’s “GoGoRiki” or something else, CW4Kids seems committed to keeping us entertained and intrigued. User6: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on December 30, 2023, at 10:45 PM Absolutely loved the promo and how they’re handling the transition – respectful yet forward-looking. The teaser has definitely piqued my curiosity. Hoping “GoGoRiki” delivers and becomes a worthy successor to the Kids’ WB lineup we’ve grown to love. CW4KidsForumMod Posted on December 30, 2023, at 11:00 PM We’re thrilled you all caught the promo and are excited about the transition!

User4: RetroRewind Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:00 AM Pogoriki? That’s fantastic news! Such a clever way to announce “GoGoRiki” without explicitly saying it. I’ve missed the humor and vibrant animation style of the show. Looks like CW4Kids isn’t just holding onto legacies; they’re really embracing new tales and characters. Kudos to the team for the smart reveal! User5: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on January 2, 2024, at 10:30 AM DetectiveToon, your investigative skills are top-notch!

User1: DetectiveToon Posted on January 2, 2024, at 11:45 AM Hey @CW4KidsForumMod, out of curiosity and just for clarity, which company do you officially represent here in the forum? Is it Warner Bros, still overseeing some parts of CW4Kids during this transitional period, or are you directly with 4Kids Entertainment now? The blend of old and new has been fascinating, and I’m just trying to understand from whose perspective we’re seeing these exciting updates! 🙂 CW4KidsForumMod Posted on January 2, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hi @DetectiveToon, great question! I’m here representing 4Kids Entertainment. While we’re currently in the midst of this transitional period and working closely with Warner Bros to ensure a smooth handover for CW4Kids, my role is to directly engage with and update our amazing community on behalf of 4Kids Entertainment. We’re committed to maintaining the essence of what makes Saturday morning cartoons special while infusing the lineup with fresh and exciting content. Thanks for your keen interest, and don’t hesitate to reach out with more questions! Forum Thread Title: “The Fate of ‘Squish’ on CW4Kids – Any Hope for a Comeback?” User1: SquishSuperFan Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:05 AM Hey everyone, I’ve been holding onto hope that we might see ‘Squish’ make a grand return to CW4Kids. It had such a unique charm and humor that set it apart. With all the new shows and changes happening, has anyone heard anything about ‘Squish’ coming back? User2: ToonTrackerTina Posted on July 15, 2024, at 9:30 AM I totally get where you’re coming from, @SquishSuperFan. ‘Squish’ was a refreshing show, but from what I’ve gathered, there are no plans to bring it back to CW4Kids. The lineup seems pretty set, especially with the new shows they’ve introduced and the direction the network is heading in. It looks like ‘Squish’ won’t fit into their current or future programming slate, unfortunately. User3: AnimationAdmirer Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:00 AM Yeah, it’s a bit disappointing. ‘Squish’ offered something different that you don’t see in every cartoon. But CW4Kids seems to be focusing on a specific vibe with their current lineup, leaning more towards action-packed and adventure-driven content with shows like ‘Pokemon Horizons’ and ‘TMNT: Back to the Sewers’. It’s likely ‘Squish’ doesn’t align with their new thematic focus. User4: RetroToonLover Posted on July 15, 2024, at 10:45 AM I was holding out hope too, but it makes sense with the direction CW4Kids is taking. The network is probably looking to establish a strong identity post-transition, and unfortunately, ‘Squish’ might not fit into that vision. It’s a shame though; diversity in content is always refreshing. User5: NewEraNick Posted on July 15, 2024, at 11:30 AM While I understand the disappointment, CW4Kids’ lineup has been pretty solid, even without ‘Squish’. They’ve done a good job balancing nostalgia with introducing new and engaging content. Maybe it’s time for us to discover our next favorite show among their offerings? CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Hey, @SquishSuperFan and everyone else feeling the ‘Squish’ blues! We appreciate your passion for the show and understand your disappointment. Our goal at CW4Kids is to create a diverse and dynamic viewing experience that resonates with our audience’s evolving tastes. While there are no current plans to bring back ‘Squish’, we’re always evaluating our lineup to ensure it delivers the best in animated entertainment. Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we navigate this exciting chapter for CW4Kids! Write a reply from the mod suggesting some alternatives, and saying while the show won’t return anytime soon, here’s some other great stuff CW4KidsForumMod Posted on July 15, 2024, at 12:30 PM Hey @SquishSuperFan and all our dedicated viewers, I totally hear you on missing ‘Squish’ and the unique flavor it brought to our lineup. While it’s true that ‘Squish’ won’t be returning anytime soon, we’re committed to ensuring our lineup remains filled with shows that capture the imagination, humor, and adventure you loved in ‘Squish’. For those of you looking for something a bit different yet equally captivating, I’d highly recommend giving “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a shot. It’s filled with whimsical stories and vibrant characters that bring a similar charm and creativity to the table. Another show that’s been a hit among our audience is “GoGoRiki.” Its quirky humor and engaging plots offer something for everyone, blending comedy, friendship, and life lessons in a unique way that has resonated with many of our viewers. And, for those who enjoy exploring new worlds and embarking on exciting quests, “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” has been making waves. It introduces fresh adventures and characters that continue to expand the beloved Pokemon universe. We understand that while these alternatives may not replace ‘Squish’, they represent the diverse and entertaining content CW4Kids strives to deliver. Our goal is to fill your Saturday mornings with stories that make you laugh, think, and dream. Thank you again for your understanding, enthusiasm, and support. CW4Kids is here to bring you the very best in animation, and we’re excited to have you with us on this journey!

It was a touching send-off, acknowledging the show’s end on the network. They also suggested four alternatives to fill the Johnny-shaped hole in our hearts. The whole ad had that new CW4Kids tech-themed presentation style, really driving home the transition. Did anyone else catch this? User2: ToonAdventurer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM I saw it too! Really felt the end of an era vibe with that “The lab is now closing” message. The alternatives suggested were “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Viva Pinata,” and “Chaotic,” right? Styled in that sleek, new CW4Kids presentation, it somehow made the farewell a little less bittersweet. I’ll miss “Johnny Test,” but it’s a good nudge to explore the new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningSage Posted on April 6, 2024, at 12:45 PM Certainly a creative way to say goodbye to “Johnny Test” and transition fans to other shows. The CW4Kids presentational style they used was spot on—futuristic and vibrant, fitting the channel’s new direction perfectly. I’ve been a fan of “Johnny Test” for years, but the alternatives they suggested sound promising. Might give “GoGoRiki” a shot next Saturday! User4: NewEraToonGoer Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:00 PM It’s refreshing to see CW4Kids handling the transition with such care. “Johnny Test” has been a staple, but the ad’s tech-themed presentation style made the alternatives seem appealing. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” caught my eye; it has that quirky charm “Johnny Test” fans might enjoy. Good on CW4Kids for guiding viewers towards new favorites. User5: DigitalCartoonDiva Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM That “The lab is now closing” ad had me feeling all sorts of emotions. But the way they presented the alternatives, all snazzy and tech-styled, showcased CW4Kids’ commitment to its new era. “Viva Pinata” and “Chaotic” seem like they’ll fill the action-comedy void left by “Johnny Test.” Excited to see what these shows have to offer! User6: RetroToonLover Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:30 PM The farewell ad for “Johnny Test” was a classy move by CW4Kids. Using their new presentation style to introduce alternatives shows they’re serious about keeping viewers hooked with engaging content. “Johnny Test” will be missed, but the network’s new lineup seems ready to take up the mantle. Here’s to new adventures! CW4KidsForumMod Posted on April 6, 2024, at 1:45 PM It’s heartwarming to see the community come together to bid farewell to “Johnny Test.” The “lab is now closing” ad was our way of softly transitioning fans towards our exciting new lineup, rendered in our fresh presentational style.

Использование разгрузки вычислений может привести к экономии энергии и улучшению производительности мобильных систем. Однако этот подход обычно зависит от различных факторов, таких как скорость передачи данных и объем данных, передаваемых по сети. Для мобильных клиентов, работающих с облачными вычислениями, важным является баланс между энергозатратами на локальную обработку и на обмен данными. Принятие решения о переходе к облачным вычислениям должно основываться на стремлении к улучшению производительности и/или снижению энергопотребления. Этот выбор имеет значение как для мобильных облачных вычислений, так и для мобильных периферийных вычислений, так как иногда разгрузка вычислений не приносит ожидаемых результатов. 2. Задержка. Когда дело касается пользовательского опыта на мобильных устройствах, быстрая реакция приложения всегда предпочтительна. Согласно исследованию, пользователи воспринимают действия, которые занимают менее 100 миллисекунд, как мгновенные, в то время как действия, требующие более 1 секунды, воспринимаются как задержки в работе приложения. Передача больших объемов данных с мобильных устройств на сервер, производительность и загруженность сервера могут увеличить задержку на мобильных устройствах. 3. Сеть. Из-за постоянной мобильности устройств нельзя ожидать постоянного и стабильного соединения мобильных приложений с Интернетом. Мобильные устройства часто переключаются между различными типами сетей (такими как 3G, 4G и Wi-Fi) с переменной скоростью передачи данных. Подключение к перегруженным и ненадежным сетям может вызывать проблемы с приложениями, такие как медленная загрузка изображений, зависание экрана, блокировки или прерывание текущих операций.

Marksizmi kendi döneminin koşullarına uygulayarak geliştirmiştir ve çeşitli ana ilkeleri vardır. İşte Leninizmin temel ilkeleri: 1. **Emperyalizmin Eleştirisi**: Lenin, emperyalizmi, kapitalizmin en yüksek ve son aşaması olarak tanımlar. Emperyalizmin, dünya çapında sermayenin birikimi ve tekellerin oluşmasına yol açtığını, böylece kapitalist ülkelerin ekonomik çıkarlarını korumak için sömürgecilik ve savaşlara başvurduklarını ileri sürer. 2. **Proletarya Diktatörlüğü**: Lenin, işçi sınıfının (proletarya) devrim yoluyla iktidarı ele geçirmesi ve bir \\"proletarya diktatörlüğü\\" kurması gerektiğini savunur. Bu, işçi sınıfının devlet aracılığıyla kapitalist sınıfa karşı iktidarını sürdürmesi anlamına gelir. 3. **Avangard Parti**: Leninizm, devrimin başarıya ulaşması için disiplinli ve teorik olarak donanımlı bir \\"avangard\\" partinin gerekliliğini vurgular. Bu parti, işçi sınıfının çıkarlarını temsil eder ve devrim sürecinde liderlik rolü üstlenir. Lenin, işçi sınıfının devrimci bilince sahip olmasının ancak böyle bir partinin rehberliğiyle mümkün olacağını belirtir. 4. **Demokratik Merkeziyetçilik**: Leninizmin parti içi işleyişinde teorik bir temel oluşturur. Demokratik olarak alınan kararların merkeziyetçi bir şekilde uygulanmasını savunur. Parti içinde çeşitlilik ve tartışmaya değer verilirken, karar alındıktan sonra tüm üyelerin bu karara uyması beklenir. 5. **Gelişmekte Olan Ülkelerde Devrim**: Lenin, kapitalizmin küresel olduğunu ve emperyalist güçlerin gelişmekte olan ülkeler üzerindeki etkisinin, bu ülkelerde devrimci potansiyali artırdığını belirtir. Leninizm, bu bağlamda, ulusal kurtuluş hareketlerini ve anti-emperyalist mücadeleyi destekler. 6. **Sosyalizm ve Komünizme Geçiş**: Lenin, sosyalizm ve sonrasında komünizme geçişin, işçi sınıfının devlet kontrolünü ele alması ve üretim araçlarının kolektif mülkiyetine dayanan bir toplumun kurulmasıyla mümkün olacağını savunur. Leninizm, 20. yüzyılda birçok komünist harekete temel teorik ve ideolojik çerçeve sundu ve dünya çapında birçok devrimci mücadelede etkili oldu. Sovyetler Birliği'nde ve diğer sosyalist ülkelerde uygulamaya konulan politikalar, bu ilkelerden güçlü bir şekilde etkilendi."},{"prompt":"Перепишите на русском языке предоставленный текст, сохраняя его общий смысл и структуру, но используя: Разнообразную лексику, Перефразирование и переформулирование предложений, Изменение порядка слов и структуры предложений, Улучшение читабельности и удобочитаемости, Сохранение точности и ясности исходного текста.

Temel olarak, maddeci tarih anlayışı ve doğanın diyalektik yasaları üzerine kurulmuştur. Bu teoriye göre, tarih boyunca toplumsal değişimler ve gelişmeler, maddi koşulların ve üretim ilişkilerinin sürekli değişimi ve çelişkileriyle açıklanabilir. Diyalektik Materyalizm, bu yönüyle tarihi ve toplumu anlama çabasında, din ve metafiziği bir kenara bırakır ve ateizmle yakından ilişkilendirilir. Ateizm, Tanrı’nın varlığını reddeden veya Tanrı inancına şüpheyle yaklaşan bir düşünce sistemi olarak tanımlanabilir. Diyalektik Materyalizm'in ateizm ile bağı, bu felsefi sistemin maddiyatı her şeyin temeli olarak kabul etmesi ve üstünlük tanımasıdır. Diyalektik Materyalizm, doğaüstü ve metafizik açıklamalardan arınmış bir dünya görüşü sunar; bu da onu temelde ateist bir felsefe yapar. Dinler genellikle doğaüstü varlıklara, olaylara ve metafizik açıklamalara dayanırken, Diyalektik Materyalizm maddi dünyayı ve onun içindeki çelişkileri ve dönüşümleri incelemeye odaklanır. Marx, dinin toplumda \\"insanların afyonu\\" olduğunu iddia ederek, dinin baskı altındaki sınıfları sakinleştiren ve mevcut toplumsal düzensizliklere boyun eğmelerini sağlayan bir araç olarak işlev gördüğünü belirtmiştir. Bu bağlamda, Diyalektik Materyalizm, maddi koşulların ve insanların kendi eylemlerinin tarihsel değişimlerdeki rolünü vurgulama yoluyla, dinin toplumdaki etkisini sorgulamakta ve eleştirmektedir. Sonuç olarak, Diyalektik Materyalizm'in ateizm ile olan bağı, bu düşünce sisteminin din ve metafiziğe alternatif olarak maddi dünyayı ve onun değişim yasalarını merkeze almasıdır. Marx ve Engels'in çalışmaları, dinin toplumsal ve ekonomik yapılar üzerindeki etkisini reddederek, ateist bir düşünce yapısını destekler niteliktedir."},{"prompt":"dans unity lorsque je clique sur un segment (sprite) j'ai ce script : \\"using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; public class ClickToDisplayColor : MonoBehaviour { private Color objectColor; private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer; void Start() { // Récupère le SpriteRenderer attaché à ce GameObject spriteRenderer = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>(); // Récupère la couleur actuelle du SpriteRenderer objectColor = spriteRenderer.color; } // Cette fonction est appelée lorsqu’on clique sur le Collider private void OnMouseDown() { // Affiche la couleur dans la console sous forme de RGB Debug.Log(\\"Couleur de l’objet : {objectColor}\\"); // Changez la couleur du handle de slider via le ColorManager ColorManager.Instance.ChangeSliderHandleColor(objectColor); } } \\" j'aimerai qu'il m'affiche la couleur : objectColor ; sur un autre objet de la scène Handle (qui fait partie d'un slider) je veux que ce sprite (handle) prenne la couleur du segment fais un script pour le handle","completion":"Pour permettre à ton Handle du slider de prendre la couleur du segment sur lequel tu cliques, tu peux suivre les étapes ci-dessous.

Si tu n'as pas déjà une telle fonction, la voilà : \`\`\`csharp // Assure-toi que cette classe soit un Singleton pour permettre un accès facile depuis d'autres scripts. public class ColorManager : MonoBehaviour { public static ColorManager Instance; // Instance Singleton public Slider slider; // Assure-toi d'assigner ce slider dans l'inspector de Unity private void Awake() { if (Instance == null) { Instance = this; DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject); // Optionnel } else { Destroy(gameObject); } } // Fonction pour changer la couleur du handle du slider public void ChangeSliderHandleColor(Color color) { SpriteRenderer handleSpriteRenderer = slider.handleRect.GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>(); if (handleSpriteRenderer != null) { handleSpriteRenderer.color = color; } else { Debug.LogError(\\"Le component SpriteRenderer n'est pas trouvé sur le handle du Slider.\\"); } } } \`\`\` Assure-toi que le slider dont le handle doit changer de couleur soit bien assigné dans le champ \`slider\` de \`ColorManager\` via l'Inspector de Unity. # Étape 2: Script pour le Handle (si nécessaire) Si ton handle a besoin d'un script spécifique pour gérer des comportements supplémentaires (autres que changer sa couleur), le script ressemblerait à quelque chose comme cela. Toutefois, dans ton cas, il semble que le \`ColorManager\` s'occupe déjà de changer la couleur. Si tu as besoin de plus de fonctionnalités spécifiques, tu pourrais les implémenter dans un script attaché au GameObject Handle : \`\`\`csharp // Ce script pourrait être attaché au GameObject Handle si un comportement spécifique est nécessaire using UnityEngine; public class HandleBehavior : MonoBehaviour { private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer; void Start() { spriteRenderer = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>(); } public void ChangeColor(Color newColor) { if (spriteRenderer != null) { spriteRenderer.color = newColor; } } } \`\`\` Ce script ne serait nécessaire que si tu avais des comportements ou fonctions supplémentaires à gérer spécifiquement pour le handle. Pour simplement changer sa couleur via le \`ColorManager\`, aucune action supplémentaire n'est requise sur le handle lui-même, à part s'assurer qu'il est correctement référencé et configuré dans le \`ColorManager\`. # Conclusion Le processus principal pour changer la couleur du handle réside dans tes scripts \`ClickToDisplayColor\` et \`ColorManager\`. Le script \`HandleBehavior\` serait uniquement nécessaire pour des comportements supplémentaires et spécifiques au handle.

Cela signifie que tu peux voir et modifier la variable directement depuis l'interface de Unity. - \`Slider\`: Il s'agit du type de la variable. Dans ce cas, \`Slider\` est une référence à un composant de l'interface utilisateur (UI) de Unity qui permet aux utilisateurs d'ajuster une valeur numérique à l'aide d'un mécanisme glissant. La clarification que \`Slider\` est un type indique que cette variable peut stocker une référence à un objet Slider dans ta scène ou dans tes préfabriqués. - \`slider\`: C'est le nom de la variable. Cela te permet de référencer et d'interagir avec le Slider auquel tu l'affecteras, dans les autres parties de ton script. - \`// Assure-toi d’assigner ce slider dans l’inspector de Unity\`: C'est un commentaire destiné à toi, le développeur, te rappelant qu'après avoir ajouté ce script à un GameObject dans ta scène Unity, tu dois manuellement glisser un objet Slider depuis ta scène ou tes Assets dans le champ qui apparait dans l'Inspector pour cette variable. Sans cette étape, la variable \`slider\` sera \`null\` lors de l'exécution, et toute tentative d'accéder à ses propriétés ou fonctions générera une erreur \`NullReferenceException\`. # Pourquoi c’est Important? La capacité d'assigner des objets via l'Inspector offre une grande flexibilité dans la manière dont tu structures et interconnectes les composants de ton projet Unity. Elle permet une modification rapide sans devoir modifier le code, un avantage pour tester divers éléments, adapter le comportement du jeu, et travailler en équipe où les membres peuvent ajuster les valeurs sans toucher au code. # Comment le Faire: 1. Crée ou trouve le \`Slider\` UI dans la scène de Unity. 2. Sélectionne le GameObject auquel ton script est attaché. Tu verras le script listé dans l'Inspector. 3. Dans l'Inspector, il y aura un champ avec le nom \`slider\` sous le script attaché. Ce champ sera vide initialement. 4. Glisse l'objet \`Slider\` depuis la hiérarchie de ta scène (ou tes Assets) jusqu'à ce champ vide dans l'Inspector. Cela \\"assigne\\" ce spécifique Slider à la variable \`slider\` de ton script.

Cela peut se produire pour diverses raisons, généralement liées à une mauvaise déclaration ou à une portée de variable. Voici les vérifications à faire pour résoudre ce problème : 1. **Vérification de la Déclaration :** Assure-toi que tu as bien déclaré la variable \`slider\` dans ton script \`ColorManager\` de façon à ce qu'elle soit accessible à l'endroit où tu tentes de l'utiliser. La déclaration doit ressembler à ce qui suit, et elle doit se trouver en dehors de toute méthode, mais à l'intérieur de la classe \`ColorManager\` : \`\`\`csharp public class ColorManager : MonoBehaviour { // Assure-toi que cette ligne soit bien présente public Slider slider; // Le reste de ton code... } \`\`\` 2. **Assignation dans l'Inspector :** Comme le champ \`slider\` est public, vérifie une fois de plus dans l'Inspector de Unity que tu as bien glissé un objet Slider dans ce champ. Une variable non assignée dans l'Inspector peut aussi causer des erreurs, bien que l'erreur mentionnée semble plutôt indiquer un souci de déclaration ou de portée. 3. **Utilisation Correcte :** Lorsque tu utilises la variable \`slider\`, assure-toi de le faire à l'intérieur de la classe \`ColorManager\` ou d'une manière qui respecte la portée de cette variable. Si tu essaies d'accéder à \`slider\` depuis une autre classe sans passer par une référence spécifique à un objet \`ColorManager\`, tu rencontreras des erreurs. 4. **Nom Correct de la Classe et du Namespace :** Vérifie si \`Slider\` est effectivement le type que tu penses utiliser. Normalement, \`Slider\` fait référence au composant UI Slider de Unity et nécessite \`using UnityEngine.UI;\` en haut de ton fichier script pour être reconnu : \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; // Ceci est nécessaire pour utiliser Slider et autres composants UI public class ColorManager : MonoBehaviour { public Slider slider; // Le reste de ton code... } \`\`\` En suivant ces vérifications, tu devrais pouvoir corriger l'erreur \`CS0103\` et faire en sorte que ta variable \`slider\` soit correctement reconnue et utilisable dans ton script \`ColorManager\`."},{"prompt":"dans unity lorsque je clique sur un segment (sprite : PurpleRedSegment avec la couleur rouge assigné ) j’ai ce script : “using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; public class ClickToDisplayColor : MonoBehaviour { private Color objectColor; private SpriteRenderer spriteRenderer; void Start() { // Récupère le SpriteRenderer attaché à ce GameObject spriteRenderer = GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>(); // Récupère la couleur actuelle du SpriteRenderer objectColor = spriteRenderer.color; } // Cette fonction est appelée lorsqu’on clique sur le Collider private void OnMouseDown() { // Affiche la couleur dans la console sous forme de RGB Debug.Log(“Couleur de l’objet : {objectColor}”); // Changez la couleur du handle de slider via le ColorManager ColorManager.Instance.ChangeSliderHandleColor(objectColor); } } ” j’aimerai qu’il m’affiche la couleur : objectColor ; sur un autre objet de la scène il s'agit d'un Handle de slider je veux que ce sprite (handle) prenne la couleur du segment sur lequel j'ai cliqué","completion":"Pour accomplir cette tâche, tu auras besoin de plusieurs éléments configurés correctement. Je vais te guider à travers les étapes nécessaires pour que le Handle du Slider change de couleur en fonction du sprite sur lequel tu cliques. Ce processus implique le script \`ClickToDisplayColor\` que tu as déjà et un script \`ColorManager\` pour gérer la couleur du slider. Ensuite, il te faudra un moyen de communiquer avec le Handle du Slider pour changer sa couleur. # Étape 1: Configurer le script ColorManager Si tu n'as pas déjà un script \`ColorManager\`, tu devras en créer un. Ce script utilisera un motif Singleton pour s'assurer qu'une seule instance est disponible dans la scène. Voici un exemple basique : \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; // Nécessaire pour accéder aux composants UI tels que Slider public class ColorManager : MonoBehaviour { public static ColorManager Instance; // Singleton instance void Awake() { if (Instance == null) { Instance = this; DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject); // Optionnel, cela garde l'objet persistant entre les scènes } else { Destroy(gameObject); } } public void ChangeSliderHandleColor(Color color) { // Trouve le Slider dans la scène. // Remarque : Cela suppose que tu as seulement un Slider dans ta scène. Si tu en as plusieurs, tu devrais avoir une référence directe au Slider concerné.

Assure-toi donc que le GameObject de handle du Slider a un composant \`Image\`. 3. **ColorManager**: Place le script \`ColorManager\` sur un GameObject dans ta scène. Comme il utilise un Singleton, tu n'as pas besoin de le référencer directement dans tes autres scripts tant que tu utilises \`ColorManager.Instance\` pour accéder à ses fonctions. # Étape 4: Tester Lorsque tu exécuteras ta scène et cliqueras sur le sprite \`PurpleRedSegment\`, le script \`ClickToDisplayColor\` devrait capturer la couleur du \`SpriteRenderer\` et passer cette couleur à \`ColorManager\`, qui à son tour trouvera le \`Slider\` dans la scène et changera la couleur de son Handle. # Note Importante Ce guide suppose que tu as un seul \`Slider\` dans ta scène. Si tu as plusieurs Sliders et que tu souhaites changer la couleur du Handle d'un Slider spécifique, tu devrais modifier le \`ColorManager\` pour cibler ce Slider spécifiquement, peut-être en passant un paramètre supplémentaire ou en définissant des références spécifiques dans le script."},{"prompt":"dans mon slider le handle sutilise un sprite et non une image","completion":"Si ton handle de slider utilise un \`Sprite\` au lieu d'une \`Image\`, la façon de changer sa couleur diffère légèrement de celle utilisée pour une \`Image\`.

Adaptons donc le script \`ColorManager\` pour prendre en compte cette particularité. # Adapter le script ColorManager \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; // Utilisé ici uniquement si tu manipules d'autres éléments UI.

Sélectionne ton GameObject de handle dans la hiérarchie. 2. Dans l'Inspector, en haut, tu verras le champ \\"Tag\\" à côté du nom du GameObject. Clique dessus, et puis, clique sur \\"Add Tag...\\". 3. Ajoute un nouveau Tag appelé \\"SliderHandle\\". 4. Retourne à ton GameObject de handle, et assigne-lui maintenant le tag \\"SliderHandle\\" via le champ \\"Tag\\". # Conclusion En suivant cette approche, tu permets au handle de slider d'avoir sa couleur modifiée en fonction de celle d'un sprite sélectionné dans la scène, malgré l'utilisation d'un \`SpriteRenderer\` au lieu d'une \`Image\`. Assure-toi de bien tagger le handle pour que le script puisse le trouver."},{"prompt":"le alpha de la couleur selectionné dans mon segment est à 0 est-ce que je peux le rajouter après pour qu'il soit à 1 dans le script ?","completion":"Oui, tu peux ajuster la valeur alpha de la couleur sélectionnée directement dans ton script avant de l'appliquer au handle du slider ou à tout autre objet. Lorsque tu récupères la couleur de l'objet cliqué et que tu souhaites ajuster l'alpha pour qu’il soit complètement opaque (alpha = 1), tu peux le faire de la manière suivante : # Ajustement dans la fonction OnMouseDown Lorsque tu captures la couleur dans \`ClickToDisplayColor\`, juste avant de l'envoyer au \`ColorManager\`, tu modifies l'alpha : \`\`\`csharp private void OnMouseDown() { // Affiche la couleur dans la console sous forme de RGB Debug.Log(\\"Couleur de l’objet : {objectColor}\\"); // Modifie l'alpha de la couleur récupérée à 1 pour la rendre complètement opaque Color colorWithFullAlpha = new Color(objectColor.r, objectColor.g, objectColor.b, 1f); // Changez la couleur du handle de slider via le ColorManager avec l'alpha ajusté ColorManager.Instance.ChangeSliderHandleColor(colorWithFullAlpha); } \`\`\` Ce code crée une nouvelle couleur \`colorWithFullAlpha\`, en utilisant les composants rouge, vert et bleu (\`r\`, \`g\`, \`b\`) de la couleur originale \`objectColor\`, mais en fixant manuellement l'alpha à \`1f\` (complètement opaque). Cette nouvelle couleur est alors passée à \`ChangeSliderHandleColor()\` avec l'alpha désiré. # Application dans ChangeSliderHandleColor Ou bien, si tu préfères que la logique d’ajustement de l'alpha soit gérée dans le \`ColorManager\` (par exemple, pour centraliser la manipulation des couleurs), tu peux également modifier la couleur au sein de la méthode \`ChangeSliderHandleColor\` : \`\`\`csharp public void ChangeSliderHandleColor(Color color) { GameObject sliderHandle = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag(\\"SliderHandle\\"); if (sliderHandle != null) { SpriteRenderer handleSpriteRenderer = sliderHandle.GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>(); if (handleSpriteRenderer != null) { // Ajuste l'alpha ici, avant d’appliquer la couleur Color colorWithFullAlpha = new Color(color.r, color.g, color.b, 1f); handleSpriteRenderer.color = colorWithFullAlpha; } else { Debug.LogError(\\"SpriteRenderer not found on the slider handle.\\"); } } else { Debug.LogError(\\"Slider handle not found. Make sure it's tagged correctly in the scene.\\"); } } \`\`\` En ajustant l'alpha soit dans \`OnMouseDown\` soit dans \`ChangeSliderHandleColor\`, tu te assures que toute couleur appliquée via cette méthode sera totalement opaque, peu importe l'alpha de la couleur originale de l'objet cliqué."},{"prompt":"sur unity j'ai 5 image (image1, image2...) que j'ai supperposé et avec un bouton next et previous je veux pouvoir changer ces swicher ces images","completion":"Pour créer un système de navigation entre images avec des boutons \\"Next\\" et \\"Previous\\" dans Unity, tu peux suivre cette approche. Je vais te montrer comment préparer ton environnement Unity et aussi t'offrir un script de base que tu peux attacher à un contrôleur dans ta scène pour gérer la navigation entre les images. # Préparation dans Unity 1. **Images Superposées**: Crée 5 objets \`Image\` sous un même parent dans ta hiérarchie de scène. Tu peux les créer comme des enfants d'un objet \`Canvas\` si tu es en train de travailler avec une interface UI. Assigne à chaque \`Image\` le sprite ou l'image que tu veux afficher. 2. **Boutons**: Crée deux boutons UI, un pour \\"Next\\" et un pour \\"Previous\\". Tu trouveras les boutons sous le menu \`GameObject\` -> \`UI\` -> \`Button\`. # Script de Contrôle Crée un script nommé \`ImageGalleryController\` (ou le nom que tu préfères) et copie le code suivant dans le fichier du script : \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; // Nécessaire pour manipuler les objets UI tels que les Images et les Boutons public class ImageGalleryController : MonoBehaviour { public GameObject[] images; // Tableau pour stocker tes images private int currentIndex = 0; // Index pour savoir quelle image est actuellement visible void Start() { UpdateImageVisibility(); } // Méthode pour afficher l'image précédente public void ShowPreviousImage() { if(currentIndex > 0) { currentIndex--; UpdateImageVisibility(); } } // Méthode pour afficher l'image suivante public void ShowNextImage() { if(currentIndex < images.Length - 1) { currentIndex++; UpdateImageVisibility(); } } // Met à jour la visibilité des images en fonction de currentIndex void UpdateImageVisibility() { for(int i = 0; i < images.Length; i++) { images[i].SetActive(i == currentIndex); // Affiche seulement l'image courante } } } \`\`\` # Configuration dans Unity 1. **Attacher le Script**: Crée un objet vide dans ta scène, nomme-le \\"ImageGalleryController\\", et attache le script \`ImageGalleryController\` à cet objet. 2. **Assigner des Images**: Sélectionne l'objet \\"ImageGalleryController\\" dans l'inspector, trouve le champ \`Images\` exposé par le script, et ajuste sa taille à 5 (ou au nombre d'images que tu as). Puis, glisse chacune de tes images dans les emplacements vides du tableau \`Images\`. 3. **Configurer les Boutons**: Sélectionne ton bouton \\"Next\\", trouve dans l'inspector la section \\"On Click ()\\" du composant \`Button\`. Clique sur le \`+\` pour ajouter une nouvelle action. Glisse l'objet \\"ImageGalleryController\\" dedans, et ensuite, à travers le menu déroulant, sélectionne \`ImageGalleryController -> ShowNextImage\`. Répète cette procédure pour le bouton \\"Previous\\", mais choisis \`ShowPreviousImage\` à la place. # Tester le Projet Exécute ta scène. Quand tu cliques sur le bouton \\"Next\\", tu devrais voir chacune de tes images apparaître une par une. Quand tu cliques sur \\"Previous\\", l'affichage devrait revenir à l'image précédente. Cette solution est assez basique et pourrait nécessiter des ajustements selon tes besoins spécifiques, comme l'ajout d'animations ou la gestion de cas où il n'y a pas d'images à montrer."},{"prompt":"comment je pourrais proceder sur unity pour faire comme le logiciel paint de microsoft et avoir une image et pouvoir peindre à l'intérieur ?","completion":"Créer une application similaire à Microsoft Paint dans Unity, où les utilisateurs peuvent peindre sur une image, implique quelques concepts clés de programmation des graphismes. Unity n'offre pas directement une fonctionnalité \\"paint\\" comme dans MS Paint, mais tu peux accomplir quelque chose de similaire en manipulant des textures en temps réel. Voici un guide de base sur comment tu pourrais procéder : # Étape 1 : Préparation de la Scène 1. **Crée un Canvas**: Pour les éléments UI comme les boutons, les sliders pour la taille du pinceau, et la sélection de couleur. 2. **Ajoute un Panel ou un GameObject avec une Image/Texture**: Celui-ci servira de \\"toile\\" où l'utilisateur peut dessiner. # Étape 2 : Script de Dessin Tu auras besoin d'un script qui permet à l'utilisateur de dessiner sur la toile. Ce script détectera les inputs de l'utilisateur et convertira ces inputs en marques de peinture sur la texture de l'image. Voici un exemple de script de base que tu pourrais utiliser pour commencer : \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class SimplePaint : MonoBehaviour { public Texture2D texture; private Vector2 textureSize = new Vector2(1024, 768); // La taille de ta toile void Start() { // Crée une nouvelle texture blanche texture = new Texture2D((int)textureSize.x, (int)textureSize.y); GetComponent<Renderer>().material.mainTexture = texture; // Assigner la texture à l'objet } void Update() { // Vérifier si l'utilisateur clique et dessine sur la toile if (Input.GetMouseButton(0)) { Vector2 pixelPosition = Vector2.zero; // Convertir la position de la souris en position de pixel sur la texture RectTransformUtility.ScreenPointToLocalPointInRectangle(GetComponent<RectTransform>(), Input.mousePosition, null, out pixelPosition); pixelPosition += new Vector2(textureSize.x / 2, textureSize.y / 2); // Ajuster basé sur la position de l'objet // Dessine un point à la position texture.SetPixel((int)pixelPosition.x, (int)pixelPosition.y, Color.black); // Changer Color.black avec la couleur sélectionnée texture.Apply(); // Appliquer les changements sur la texture } } } \`\`\` Ce code est juste un exemple de base pour illustrer le concept. Selon l'application finale, il peut nécessiter des ajustements significatifs. # Important à Noter - **Performance**: La méthode \`SetPixel\` et l'appel à \`Apply\` peuvent être coûteux en performance si utilisés dans \`Update\` sans précautions. Pour des applications plus complexes, envisage de regrouper plusieurs modifications de pixels et de les appliquer en une seule fois. - **Interpolation et Douceur**: Pour un dessin plus lisse, tu devras interpoler entre les positions des pixels pour chaque frame et remplir les espaces pour créer des lignes continues plutôt que des points séparés. - **UI et Contrôles**: J'ai mentionné l'utilisation d'un canvas pour les contrôles, mais tu auras besoin de scripts supplémentaires pour gérer les interactions avec ces contrôles et ajuster les paramètres de dessin en conséquence (par exemple, changer la couleur, la taille du pinceau). # Extensions Possibles - **Sauvegarde et Chargement de l'Image** : Implémente la fonctionnalité pour sauvegarder et/ou charger des images depuis un fichier ou une texture. - **Outils de Dessin Avancés** : Ajoute différents types d'outils de dessin, comme des pinceaux avec différentes formes et tailles, la gomme, ou les remplissages de couleur. - **Interface Utilisateur Plus Complète** : Crée une interface plus détaillée pour une meilleure expérience utilisateur, comprenant la sélection de la couleur, la taille du pinceau, et d'autres options de paint. Réaliser une application de peinture dans Unity peut être un projet passionnant et éducatif, te permettant d'explorer à la fois la programmation graphique et le développement d'interface utilisateur dans un environnement de jeu."},{"prompt":"c'est possible d'avoir un png et de colorier / peindre dans le zone blanche en un clic ?","completion":"Oui, il est tout à fait possible d'implémenter une fonctionnalité qui permet aux utilisateurs de colorier les zones blanches d'une image PNG en un clic, un peu comme l'outil \\"seau de peinture\\" dans les logiciels de dessin. Cette fonctionnalité, connue sous le nom de \\"remplissage par diffusion\\" (ou \\"flood fill\\" en anglais), peut être complexe à mettre en œuvre de manière performante. Voici un aperçu de base de la façon dont tu pourrais procéder dans Unity. # Prérequis 1. **Préparer ton Image**: Assure-toi que ton image PNG est utilisée sur un GameObject avec un \`SpriteRenderer\` ou comme une \`Texture\` sur un \`Mesh\` avec un \`Material\`. Pour des manipulations d'image, l'utilisation d'un \`Texture2D\` est nécessaire car cela te permet d'accéder et de modifier les pixels. 2. **Importation de l'Image**: Quand tu importes ton image dans Unity, assure-toi de modifier ses settings pour qu'elle soit lue et écrivable. Tu peux faire cela dans l'inspecteur des assets en cochant \\"Read/Write Enabled\\" dans les options avancées de l'image. # Script de Base pour le Remplissage par Diffusion Voici un exemple de script qui peut être adapté pour remplir une zone spécifique d'une \`Texture2D\`. Ce script est un point de départ et peut nécessiter des optimisations pour les grandes images ou des utilisations spécifiques. \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class FloodFill : MonoBehaviour { public Texture2D sourceTexture; private Color targetColor = Color.red; // Couleur de remplissage void Start() { // Copie de la texture originale pour permettre la modification Texture2D texture = new Texture2D(sourceTexture.width, sourceTexture.height); Graphics.CopyTexture(sourceTexture, texture); GetComponent<SpriteRenderer>().sprite = Sprite.Create(texture, new Rect(0, 0, texture.width, texture.height), new Vector2(0.5f, 0.5f)); } void Update() { if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) { Vector3 worldPoint = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(Input.mousePosition); Vector2 touchPos = new Vector2(worldPoint.x, worldPoint.y); RaycastHit2D hit = Physics2D.Raycast(touchPos, Camera.main.transform.forward); if (hit.collider != null && hit.collider.gameObject == gameObject) { // Calcul des coordonnées du pixel touché var bounds = hit.collider.bounds; var hitPoint = hit.point; int x = Mathf.FloorToInt(((hitPoint.x - bounds.min.x) / (bounds.size.x)) * sourceTexture.width); int y = Mathf.FloorToInt(((hitPoint.y - bounds.min.y) / (bounds.size.y)) * sourceTexture.height); // Application du remplissage par diffusion ApplyFloodFill(sourceTexture, x, y, targetColor); sourceTexture.Apply(); // Applique les changements sur la texture } } } void ApplyFloodFill(Texture2D texture, int x, int y, Color color) { // Algorithme de remplissage par diffusion à implémenter ici // L'algorithme devra modifier la couleur des pixels autour de (x, y) avec la couleur spécifiée // en se propageant tant que la couleur du pixel est blanc ou proche du blanc } } \`\`\` # Réaliser le Remplissage par Diffusion L'implémentation de l'algorithme de remplissage par diffusion (\`FloodFill\`) est le cœur de cette fonctionnalité, mais elle peut devenir assez complexe, notamment pour gérer les performances et l'efficacité de la propagation. Il existe divers algorithmes et techniques pour réaliser cela, souvent en utilisant la récursivité ou des files d'attente pour vérifier et modifier les pixels voisins. # À prendre en compte - **Performances**: Les modifications de \`Texture2D\` en temps réel peuvent être coûteuses, particulièrement pour des images de grande taille ou des appels fréquents. Pour des performances optimales, envisage de limiter la zone de traitement ou d'appliquer des optimisations spécifiques. - **Complexité de l'Algorithme de Remplissage**: L'implémentation d'un algorithme de remplissage par diffusion efficace n'est pas triviale, surtout pour éviter les débordements de pile avec la récursivité sur des grandes images. - **Utilisation Mémoire**: Modifier des textures en temps réel peut augmenter significativement l'utilisation de la mémoire, surtout si tu travailles avec plusieurs copies de grandes textures. Cette approche te donne un aperçu de base sur la façon de commencer avec la fonctionnalité de peinture dans Unity. Selon le projet, tu devras probablement ajuster et optimiser cette solution."},{"prompt":"Напиши абзац.

Toutefois, Unity lui-même ne propose pas directement une option \\"arrondir les coins\\" pour un composant d'image. Cela peut néanmoins être réalisé de plusieurs manières : # Utiliser un Shader La manière la plus flexible d'arrondir les coins d'une image est d'utiliser un shader. Les shaders vous permettent de personnaliser l'affichage des graphiques à un niveau très basique et peuvent être employés pour créer des effets d'arrondissement dynamiques. Vous pouvez écrire votre propre shader ou en trouver un adapté en ligne. # Utiliser une Image avec des Coins Arrondis Une méthode simple consiste à utiliser une image qui a déjà des coins arrondis. Vous pouvez préparer vos assets graphiques avec des coins arrondis dans un logiciel d'édition d'images comme Photoshop avant de les importer dans Unity. # Utiliser des Masques Unity propose un composant appelé \`Mask\` qui peut être utilisé pour cacher certaines parties d'une image, ce qui peut créer l'illusion de coins arrondis. Pour ce faire, vous auriez besoin d'une image \\"masque\\" avec des coins arrondis transparents. Ensuite, vous pouvez placer le composant \`Mask\` sur un parent de votre image et utiliser l'image masque pour délimiter la forme de l'objet affiché. - Ajoutez un objet \`UI -> Image\` à votre scène. - Créez un objet \`UI -> Image\` enfant de cet objet. - Sur l'objet parent, ajoutez un composant \`Mask\`. Assurez-vous que l'image utilisée pour le masque a des coins arrondis. - L'image enfant sera coupée par le masque, donnant l'illusion de coins arrondis. # Utiliser des Sprites/UI en 9-Slices Pour des éléments UI qui doivent être redimensionnés tout en conservant leurs coins arrondis (comme des boutons ou des fenêtres), l'approche 9-Slices (ou 9-Patch) est très utile. Cette méthode consiste à diviser votre image en 9 parties : 4 coins, 4 bords et le centre. Unity peut étirer ces parties indépendamment, permettant de redimensionner votre image sans déformer les coins arrondis. Pour faire cela, vous devez importer votre image sous forme de sprite et activer le slicing dans l'inspecteur de sprite. # Utiliser des Plugins ou des Packages Il existe aussi des plugins et des packages tiers qui peuvent simplifier ce processus, offrant des solutions prêtes à l'emploi pour arrondir les coins ou apporter d'autres effets visuels à vos UI sans avoir besoin d'écrire du code supplémentaire. Selon votre projet et vos besoins spécifiques, l'une de ces méthodes pourrait être plus adaptée. Les shaders offrent une grande flexibilité et puissance, mais nécessitent des connaissances en programmation de shaders. L'utilisation de masques et d'images préparées peuvent être des solutions plus simples et rapides à mettre en place."},{"prompt":"Good riddance... Govt should not have no business in business.

Вот сам текст: Chandigarh, April 27: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most frequent functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder. It affects 5-20% of the general population. It is characterized by non-specific symptoms of pain in the abdomen, abdominal cramps, change in bowel habits, that wax and wane over the time and can have serious impact on quality of life. Dr. GS Sidhu, Principal Consultant Gastroenterology at Max Super Specialty Hospital, Mohali said that careful study of patient medical history is critical for its diagnosis. Nevertheless, severity of patient symptoms sometimes compels physicians to perform expensive diagnostic tests, transforming IBS into diagnosis of exclusion. He further said,” The presence of alarming symptoms like fever, weight loss, rectal bleeding, presence of palpable mass, age more than 50 years, family history of colorectal carcinoma, IBD, celiac disease all warrant investigation. Absence of visible signs, lack of awareness of disease and poor explanation of disease by clinician to patient keeps disease undiagnosed for a long time in most patients,” Talking about why IBS can go undiagnosed, Dr. GS Sidhu informed that most of the time symptoms of IBS like cramps, abdominal discomfort, bloating, alternate diarrhoea or constipation etc. remain nonspecific. This may change over an interval of time and most importantly no visible signs of disease. Another reason in clinical practice is that most of the time, the nature of disease is not explained to the patient by the clinician.” Talking about the causes behind IBS, Dr. GS Sidhu said that the pathophysiology of IBS is not yet completely clear. Genetic, immune, environmental, inflammatory, psychological factors in addition to visceral hypersensitivity can all play an important role, one that most likely involves the complex interactions between gut and brain (gut- brain axis). Diagnosis can be made on the basis of symptoms only, he said. “It's disruption of the brain gut axis that alters bowel motility and gut function. In addition intestinal microbiota could play a role by altering integrity of intestinal barrier and permeability. 33% of IBS patients have family history of IBS,” Previously the IBS was also being called as spastic colon. In recent years it has been observed that ingestion of wheat may cause abdominal discomfort and IBS-like symptoms in subjects without diagnosis of celiac disease. So careful history is critical for making diagnosis of IBS, maintained Dr. GS Sidhu.","completion":"В Чандигархе, 27 апреля, сообщается, что синдром раздраженного кишечника (СРК) является наиболее распространенным функциональным расстройством желудочно-кишечного тракта. От этого страдает от 5 до 20% населения. СРК проявляется неспецифичными симптомами, такими как боли в животе, спазмы, изменения в привычках опорожнения, которые могут усиливаться или ослабевать со временем и серьезно влиять на качество жизни. Доктор Ж.С. Сидху, ведущий специалист по гастроэнтерологии в больнице Max Super Specialty в Мохали, подчеркивает, что для диагностики крайне важно тщательное изучение медицинской истории пациента. Тем не менее, иногда из-за выраженности симптомов врачам приходится проводить дорогостоящие диагностические тесты, что делает СРК диагнозом по исключению. Он также добавил, что наличие тревожных симптомов, таких как лихорадка, потеря веса, кровотечение из прямой кишки, ощутимые опухоли, возраст старше 50 лет, семейная история колоректального карцинома, ВЗК, целиакия, требует дополнительного обследования. Отсутствие внешних признаков, недостаток осведомленности о заболевании и недостаточное объяснение его сути пациентам врачами оставляют болезнь недиагностированной у большинства пациентов на долгое время. Доктор Сидху также обсудил, почему СРК может оставаться недиагностированным: зачастую симптомы, такие как спазмы, дискомфорт в животе, вздутие живота, чередование диареи и запора остаются неопределенными. Это может меняться со временем, и, что наиболее важно, заболевание не имеет видимых признаков. Еще одной причиной в практике является то, что врачи зачастую не объясняют пациентам сущность заболевания. Говоря о причинах СРК, доктор Сидху отметил, что патофизиология СРК до конца не ясна. Генетические, иммунные, экологические, воспалительные, психологические факторы, а также висцеральная гиперчувствительность могут играть значительную роль в сложном взаимодействии между кишечником и мозгом. Диагноз ставится на основании симптомов. \\"Это нарушение взаимодействия мозг-кишечник может изменять мотильность кишечника и его функции. К тому же, микрофлора кишечника может влиять, изменяя целостность кишечного барьера и его проницаемость. У 33% пациентов с СРК имеется семейная история заболевания,\\" - отмечает он. Ранее СРК также называли спастическим колитом.

This will lead to a compile-time error because the loop increment expression is mandatory unless you're creating an infinite loop intentionally, which is not the case here. 2. The line \`System.out.println(\\"lcv=\\" 1cv);\` has multiple issues. Firstly, it looks like it's meant to concatenate the variable \`lcv\` within the message, but the concatenation operator \`+\` is missing. Secondly, \`1cv\` is a typo; it should likely be \`+ lcv\`. 3. The structure of the \`if\` statement is not correct. There are empty braces \`{}\` without any code inside them, which while not a syntax error in itself, is unconventional and likely not intended here. More importantly, the \`if\` statement syntax is incorrect due to how the opening and closing brackets are organized around the \`else\` statement. Here is a corrected version of the code, assuming the intention was to increment \`lcv\` within the for loop and to print its value at each iteration before checking its final value outside the loop: \`\`\`java public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { int lcv; // Declare the variable outside the loop to access it after the loop for (lcv = 1; lcv <= 8; lcv++) { System.out.println(\\"lcv=\\" + lcv); } // Now lcv is 9 after the loop exits if (lcv == 8) { System.out.println(\\"final value is 8\\"); } else { System.out.println(\\"final value is not 8\\"); // This will be executed } } } \`\`\` This corrected code will compile and run successfully.

The corrected constructor should encapsulate the assignments within its body: \`\`\`java public class ScopePractice { private int myX; private int myY; public ScopePractice(int v, int w) { myX = v; // Corrected: Ensured this assignment is inside the constructor body myY = w; // Corrected: Ensured this and fixed typo (\`my Y = w;\` to \`myY = w;\`) } public int getX() { return myX; } public int getY() { return myY; } } \`\`\` Given this class, let’s analyze the corrected and assumed code fragment based on typical intentions: \`\`\`java ScopePractice sp = new ScopePractice(12, 15); if (sp.getX() > 15) { // Assuming the correct method call is sp.getX() based on class methods // This condition is false since sp.getX() returns 12 if (sp.getY() < 12) { System.out.println(\\"Bubble B\\"); } else { System.out.println(\\"Bubble A\\"); } } else { System.out.println(\\"Bubble C\\"); // This line will be executed } \`\`\` The \`sp.getX()\` returns 12, thus making the condition \`if (sp.getX() > 15)\` false. Therefore, control goes directly to the \`else\` part, printing \\"Bubble C\\". Hence, the correct answer to the question about the output of the code fragment, after addressing the indicated assumptions and corrections, is: C. Bubble C"},{"prompt":"Use the following class and program to answer the question.

Let's analyze step by step: 1. An object \`n\` of \`ClassA\` is created with \`myNum1 = 4\` and \`myNum2 = -1\`. 2. An object \`temp\` of \`ClassA\` is created with \`myNum1 = 8\` and \`myNum2 = 7\`. 3. The method \`methodB\` is called on object \`n\`, passing object \`temp\` as the argument. Inside \`methodB\`: - \`myNum2\` of \`n\` (which was \`-1\`) is set to the \`myNum1\` of \`temp\` (\`8\`). - \`temp\`'s \`setMyNum2\` is invoked with \`n.getMyNum1() + 1\` (4+1=5), so \`temp.myNum2\` becomes \`5\`. - \`myNum1\` of \`n\` is incremented by \`3\`, going from \`4\` to \`7\`. After exiting \`methodB\`, the state of \`n\` is: - \`myNum1 = 7\` - \`myNum2 = 8\` The state of \`temp\` is: - \`myNum1 = 8\` (unchanged by \`methodB\`) - \`myNum2 = 5\` (changed by \`methodB\`) Finally, the main program prints the value of \`myNum1\` of \`n\`, which is \`7\`.

The correct output would be: \`\`\` n.myNum1 = 7 \`\`\` Given the options: A. n.myNum1 = 8 B. n.myNum1 = 7 C. n.myNum1 = 11 The correct answer, based on the provided code and assuming the question meant to list \\"7\\" as an option rather than \\"7\\" not being previously included among the choices, is: B. n.myNum1 = 7 (considering the error in the original question's options)."},{"prompt":"Use the following class and program to answer the question.

In \`methodB(ClassA c)\`: - \`myNum2\` of object \`n\` is set to \`c.getMyNum1()\`, which is \`b.getMyNum1() = -1\`. However, since we are eventually printing \`b.myNum2\`, changes to \`n.myNum2\` aren't directly relevant to the output. - \`c.setMyNum2(getMyNum1() + 1)\`: Here, \`getMyNum1()\` refers to \`n.myNum1\`, which is \`5\`. Therefore, \`b.myNum2\` is set to \`5 + 1 = 6\`. - \`myNum1\` of \`n\` (\`n.myNum1\`) is increased by 3, modifying \`n.myNum1\` to 8. But again, this change is not directly relevant to the printed output. **Final Output**: The last line of the program prints the value of \`b.myNum2\`, which, as we saw, has been set to \`6\`.

This can happen in several ways: 1. **Creative Expression**: Through art, writing, music, dance, or any form of creative expression, the abstract ideas and feelings from your inner world can take a tangible form that others can see, hear, or experience. This not only allows you to convey your inner reality but also to connect with others on a deeply emotional or intellectual level. 2. **Communication**: Through open, honest communication, you can share your thoughts, values, beliefs, and emotions with others, making your inner world accessible to them. This can lead to deeper connections, mutual understanding, and an exchange of ideas. 3. **Behavior and Actions**: Your actions can reflect your inner world, as when you act according to your values, beliefs, and emotions. This is perhaps the most direct way your inner world impacts the outer world, through the choices you make and the actions you take. 4. **Influence and Inspiration**: Your inner world, once externalized, can inspire or influence others. The ideas, art, and values you share can resonate with others, encouraging them to reflect, change, or take action in certain ways. 5. **Manifestation of Reality**: Some believe in the concept that the focus of our inner thoughts and feelings can influence the manifestation of our external reality, a concept popularized in various philosophical and spiritual traditions, sometimes referred to as the Law of Attraction. 6. **Social and Environmental Impact**: On a broader scale, when groups of individuals work towards expressing a shared vision or goal, the collective inner world of that group can bring about social, political, or environmental change. If your inner world were to become outer, the effects would depend on how these internal elements are expressed and the contexts in which they are realized. It could lead to personal fulfillment, deeper relationships, creative satisfaction, and even societal change. However, it also requires a level of vulnerability and courage to expose one's inner world to the judgment and influences of the external world."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A. Option 1 B. Option 3 Which of the following accessor methods fit this best? C. Option 2 Option 1: public double get_fname() { return first_name; Option 2: public String get_fname() { return first_name; Option 3: public void get_fname(String n) { return first_name;","completion":"Among the provided options, the one that correctly represents the accessor method for obtaining the value of a private instance variable \`first_name\` of type \`String\` in a \`Person\` class is: **B. Option 2** Explanation: - **Option 1** is incorrect because it indicates a return type of \`double\`, which is not suitable for a variable likely to be a \`String\` (as suggested by the names \`first_name\` and \`last_name\`). - **Option 2** is correct because it has the appropriate return type (\`String\`) for the variable \`first_name\`, and it correctly does not take any parameters for an accessor (getter) method. Accessor methods are meant to return a value of an instance variable, not receive one as input. This matches the standard convention for a getter in Java. - **Option 3** is incorrect for several reasons. Firstly, it is designed to take an input (a \`String\` named \`n\`), which is not how accessor methods (getters) are typically designed; getters should not require parameters as they are simply returning the value of an instance variable. Secondly, it is attempting to use the \`return\` keyword incorrectly, as methods with a \`void\` return type cannot return a value. This option seems more like a confused mix of setter and getter concepts. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \\"Which of the following accessor methods fit this best?\\" is C. Option 2, as it suits the purpose of providing access to a private \`String\` variable named \`first_name\` in a manner consistent with standard Java practices."},{"prompt":"The following program segement is being used to read a College name, the number of students, and the tuition from the file called \\"colleges.txt\\".

The correct options for replacing the missing code pieces to accurately read these details would be: - **Missing Code 1**: To read the entire line for the college name, which could contain spaces, \`input.nextLine()\` should be used. This ensures the full name of the college is read as a single string. - **Missing Code 2**: After reading the college name, the next item to read is the number of students, which is an integer. Thus, \`input.nextInt()\` should be used to read this integer value. **Therefore, the correct option to replace the missing code is C.** - **Missing Code 1**: \`input.nextLine()\` for reading the college's name. - **Missing Code 2**: \`input.nextInt()\` for reading the number of students. Putting it together: \`\`\`java String name = input.nextLine(); int numStu = input.nextInt(); \`\`\` Options A and B do not correctly address the format specified, as they either do not properly read the college name as a full line or misconstrue the data's sequence respectively.

Option 3 Option 2: Scanner input = new Scanner(new File(\\"Scanner.txt\\")); Option 3: String input = new String(new File(\\"Scanner.txt\\"));","completion":"To read data from a file in Java, you use a \`Scanner\` object in combination with a \`File\` object that represents the file you want to read from. Therefore, you need to pass a \`File\` object to the \`Scanner\` constructor to correctly set it up for reading data from a file. - **Option 1:** - \`Scanner input = new Scanner(\\"Scanner.txt\\");\` is incorrect because it tries to interpret the string \`\\"Scanner.txt\\"\` as the source of data, not as a file path. - **Option 2:** - \`Scanner input = new Scanner(new File(\\"Scanner.txt\\"));\` is correct. This option correctly creates a \`File\` object representing the file \`\\"Scanner.txt\\"\` and passes it to the \`Scanner\` constructor, setting it up to read data from the file. - **Option 3:** - \`String input = new String(new File(\\"Scanner.txt\\"));\` is incorrect for several reasons. First, \`new String(...)\` does not accept a \`File\` object in its constructor. Second, this line tries to declare a \`String\` object, not a \`Scanner\`, so it wouldn't set up reading from a file correctly even if the syntax was correct. **Correct Option: B.
