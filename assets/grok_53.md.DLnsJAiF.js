Check for new prime factors or higher powers: - 26 = 2 cdot 13 (covered). - 27 = 3^3 (covered). - 28 = 2^2 cdot 7 (covered). - 29 = 29 introduces a new prime. - 30 = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 (covered). - 31 = 31 introduces a new prime. - 32 = 2^5 introduces a higher power of 2. - 33 = 3 cdot 11 (covered). - 35 = 5 cdot 7 (covered).

Let's denote the geometric mean of (a_n) and (b_n) by (c_n): [ c_n = sqrt{a_n b_n}. ] 3. By the definition of (a_{n+1}) and (b_{n+1}), we have: [ a_{n+1} b_{n+1} = left( frac{2a_n b_n}{a_n + b_n} right) left( frac{a_n + b_n}{2} right) = a_n b_n. ] Therefore, [ c_{n+1} = sqrt{a_{n+1} b_{n+1}} = sqrt{a_n b_n} = c_n. ] This implies that (c_n) is constant for all (n), so: [ c_n = c_0 = sqrt{a_0 b_0}. ] 4. Next, let's examine the difference (d_n) between (b_n) and (a_n): [ d_n = b_n - a_n. ] 5.

To show convergence, we note: [ d_{n+1} leq frac{d_n^2}{2(a_n + b_n)} leq frac{d_n^2}{2c_0}. ] Since (a_n leq c_0) and (b_n geq c_0), it ensures that the series (b_n) is monotonic decreasing, and (a_n) is monotonic increasing. Given this, we can write: [ d_{n+1} leq frac{d_n^2}{4c_0}, ] which implies that each subsequent (d) term is getting smaller exponentially. 7. Using induction, we show: [ d_n leq frac{d_0}{2^n}. ] This confirms that (d_n to 0) as (n to infty). 8. From the above, it follows that: [ 0 leq c_0 - a_n leq d_n, quad 0 leq b_n - c_0 leq d_n. ] Therefore, as (d_n to 0), both (a_n) and (b_n) converge to (c_0). 9.

In the hexagon (KLMNPQ), pairs of opposite sides are parallel (because they are the intersections of the plane with pairs of parallel planes). The distance between parallel lines (QK) and (MN) is at least the distance between the faces (ADD_1A_1) and (BCC_1B_1), which is (a). 4. Similarly, the distances between parallel sides (KL) and (NP), and (LM) and (PQ) are not less than the length of one of the edges of the parallelepiped, thus also at least (a). 5. To show that the projection of the hexagon (KLMNPQ) onto any straight line lying in the plane of the hexagon is not less than (a), note that since opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, the projection onto a line (l) will coincide with the projection of one of the segments (KN, LP, MQ).

We eliminate the second case, because if angle ABQ = angle APD, then angle ADP is an external angle of triangle CDQ, and hence angle ADP = angle DCQ + angle DQC > angle AQB which is not possible. 4. Thus, we conclude angle ABC = angle ADC. 5. Since quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in a circle, opposite angles are supplementary. Therefore, angle ABC + angle ADC = 180^circ. 6.

Applying the 10% discount, we get: [ y_{A} = left(10 times 30 + 3 times 10xright) times 0.9 = 270 + 27x ] So, we have y_{A} = 27x + 270 for x geqslant 2. - For supermarket B, the cost of 10 pairs of dance shoes is 10 times 30.

The distributions can be categorized into distinct cases: (5,0,0), (4,1,0), (3,2,0), (3,1,1), and (2,2,1). We calculate the number of arrangements for each case. 1. **Case (5,0,0)**: All 5 balls are in one box. Since the boxes are indistinguishable, there is only 1 way to arrange this. 2. **Case (4,1,0)**: Four balls in one box and one ball in another. The number of ways to choose the 4 balls is binom{5}{4} = 5. 3. **Case (3,2,0)**: Three balls in one box and two in another. The number of ways to choose the 3 balls is binom{5}{3} = 10. 4. **Case (3,1,1)**: Three balls in one box and one ball in each of the other two. The number of ways to choose the 3 balls is binom{5}{3} = 10. The remaining two balls are automatically distributed among the two boxes, and since the boxes are indistinguishable, we do not multiply further. 5. **Case (2,2,1)**: Two balls in one box, two in another, and one in the last. First, we choose 2 balls for one box in binom{5}{2} = 10 ways, then choose 2 out of the remaining 3 balls for another box in binom{3}{2} = 3 ways. Since the two boxes with two balls each are indistinguishable, we've counted each arrangement twice, necessitating a division by 2, resulting in dfrac{10 times 3}{2} = 15 arrangements. Adding the arrangements from all cases, we get the total number of arrangements as 1 + 5 + 10 + 10 + 15 = 41. Therefore, the total number of ways to put 5 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes is boxed{41}. textbf{Alternate solution:} If we initially consider the boxes as distinguishable, there are 3^5 = 243 ways to distribute 5 distinguishable balls among 3 boxes. However, in our specific problem, we must adjust this count to account for the indistinguishability of the boxes. - For the case where all balls are in one box, this arrangement is counted 3 times in the total of 243. Removing the overcount leaves us with 240 arrangements. - For the remaining arrangements, since the contents of each box differ, each arrangement is counted 3! = 6 times due to permutations of the boxes. To correct for this overcount, we divide the 240 arrangements by 6, resulting in 40 unique arrangements. - Adding back the single case where all balls are in one box, we get a total of 40 + 1 = 41 distinct arrangements. Thus, by the alternate solution as well, the total number of ways to put 5 distinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes is boxed{41}."},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are denoted as a, b, and c respectively.

(AC = 2 times BC).","completion":"We must determine the perimeter of triangle ABC, knowing that BC = 1 and two out of the provided four statements are true while the other two are false. Steps to analyze each possible pair of statements: Step 1: Check if statements III and IV are true. 1. If statements III and IV are true, then: - AB = 2BC = 2 - AC = 2BC = 2 Hence, ABC would be an isosceles triangle with AB = AC = 2 and BC = 1. 2. In this case, ABC is not a right triangle because there are no right angles formed by the sides, thus, statement I is false. 3. Using the calculations for triangle: - The altitude of the triangle (perpendicular to the base BC) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: [ text{height} = sqrt{AB^2 - left(frac{BC}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{2^2 - left(frac{1}{2}right)^2} = sqrt{4 - 0.25} = sqrt{3.75} ] 4. Since sin(alpha) neq sin(30^{circ}), alpha neq 30^circ, therefore statement II is false as well. Hence, III and IV being true make statements I and II false. Step 2: Check if statements II and III are true. 1. If statements II and III are true, then: - angle A = 30^{circ} - AB = 2BC = 2 2. Draw triangle ABC with A at 30^circ. Measure AB = 2 and draw a circle centered at B with radius 1 (since BC = 1). The intersection of this circle with line AB extended forms point C. 3. For angle BAC to be 30^circ, it can be shown that ABC forms a right-angle triangle at C, angle BCA = 90^circ contradicting the problem statement. Therefore, this configuration does not work. Step 3: Check if statements II and IV are true. 1. If statements II and IV are true, then: - angle A = 30^{circ} - AC = 2BC = 2 2. Following similar constructions, this configuration satisfies similar contradictions as before and fails. Step 4: Check if statements I and III are true. 1. If statements I and III are true, then: - ABC is a right triangle. - AB = 2BC = 2 2. Choosing B as the right-angle vertex: - Hence angle ABC = 90^circ 3. Calculate AC using the Pythagorean theorem: [ AC = sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = sqrt{2^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{4 + 1} = sqrt{5} ] 4. The perimeter of triangle ABC is: [ P = AB + BC + AC = 2 + 1 + sqrt{5} = 3 + sqrt{5} ] Step 5: Check if statements I and IV are true. 1. If statements I and IV are true, then: - ABC is a right triangle. - AC = 2BC = 2 2. Placing a right angle at C provides similar calculations: - For B acting as the non-right-angle, angle ABC = 60^circ, impossible due to given corpus dimensions, thus forms a conflicting statement to being a right triangle at C.

This ratio is assumed to be representative of the ratio of tagged fish to the total fish population in the pond. So, we can set up the following proportion to solve for N: (Tagged fish in the second catch) / (Total fish in the second catch) = (Total tagged fish) / (Total fish in the pond) 2/80 = 80/N Now, we solve for N: 2N = 80 * 80 2N = 6400 N = 6400 / 2 N = 3200 Therefore, the approximate number of fish in the pond is boxed{3200} ."},{"prompt":"f sqrt{x3} is meaningful within the real number range, then the range of real number x is ____.","completion":"To ensure that sqrt{x-3} is meaningful within the real number range, the expression under the square root, x-3, must be greater than or equal to 0.

The new cost will then be C + (X/100)C. The selling price remains constant, so it's still S. The new profit, when the cost increases, is the selling price minus the new cost: New Profit = S - (C + (X/100)C) New Profit = S - C - (X/100)C New Profit = 4.2C - C - (X/100)C New Profit = 3.2C - (X/100)C We are told that this new profit is approximately 66.67% of the selling price.

Substituting the expression for x from the first condition into the second condition, we get: (82k + 5) + n = 41m + 22 Now, let's solve for n: n = 41m + 22 - (82k + 5) n = 41m + 22 - 82k - 5 n = 41m - 82k + 17 Since 82 is 2 times 41, we can simplify the equation by factoring out 41: n = 41(m - 2k) + 17 Now, we need to find the value of n that satisfies the condition that when x + n is divided by 41, the remainder is 22. We already have the remainder as 17 in the equation, so we need to add 5 to make the remainder 22 (because 22 - 17 = 5). Therefore, the number added to x before dividing by 41 is boxed{5} ."},{"prompt":"A secretive society has encrypted their message as 2534_7.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get: [ F_{2k+2}(F_{2k+2} - F_{2k+1}) - F_{2k+1}^2 = -1 ] Using the Fibonacci recurrence relation, we know: [ F_{2k+2} - F_{2k+1} = F_{2k} ] Therefore, the equation becomes: [ F_{2k+2}F_{2k} - F_{2k+1}^2 = -1 ] This is exactly the Fibonacci identity for (n = 2k+1): [ F_{2k+1-1}F_{2k+1+1} - F_{2k+1}^2 = (-1)^{2k+1} = -1 ] 6.

Can Petya prevent him from achieving this?","completion":"Let's break down the problem and analyze how Petya can ensure that Vasya cannot achieve a sum that is a natural number. First, we'll develop a lemma needed to understand the main proof. Lemma: Any number ( a ) can be represented as a sum of ( k ) fractions of the form ( frac{1}{n} ) in a finite number of ways (if it can be represented at all). **Proof of the Lemma:** 1. **Base Case:** For ( k = 1 ), the statement is trivially true because ( a = frac{1}{a} ) if ( a ) is an integer. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for ( k = l-1 ). We need to show that it holds for ( k = l ). Let's consider the largest fraction ( frac{1}{n} ) in the decomposition. This largest fraction cannot be smaller than ( frac{a}{k} ), otherwise, the sum of all fractions would be less than ( a ). Therefore, the denominator of this fraction ( n ) must be at most ( frac{k}{a} ), which means we have a finite set of possible values for ( n ). 3. For each possible value of the largest fraction, the remaining sum, which must be expressed as a sum of ( l-1 ) fractions, is also fixed. By the induction hypothesis, these remaining sums have finitely many representations. 4. Because there are finitely many choices for the largest fraction and each choice allows a finite number of representations for the remaining sum, the total number of representations of ( a ) as a sum of ( l ) fractions of the form ( frac{1}{n} ) is finite. Thus, the statement holds for ( k = l ), completing the inductive proof. # Main Proof: Now, let's use this lemma to show that Petya can prevent Vasya from making the sum of fractions on the board a natural number after any move. 1. **Initial Analysis:** Let ( S ) be the sum of all fractions on the board before Petya’s move. Vasya moves next, and he plans to add ( k ) fractions where ( k ) increases by 1 with each turn. 2. **Bound on Sum After Vasya's Move:** After Vasya’s move, the sum can increase by up to ( S + k ). Let’s denote the target sum and the numbers that should make this sum a natural number. 3. **Finite Representations:** Using our lemma, we know there is only a finite number of ways to generate these natural number sums because each potential sum involves a finite number of fractions. 4. **Petya’s Strategy:** Petya should look at the sum ( S ) before his move and find a fraction ( frac{1}{m} ) that is not part of any finite representation that Vasya could use to achieve a natural sum. Petya writes this fraction ( frac{1}{m} ) on the board. By writing a fraction that does not contribute to forming a natural number sum, Petya effectively blocks all of Vasya's potential moves resulting in a natural sum. Hence, Petya can always make a move such that Vasya will never achieve a sum that is a natural number. # Conclusion: Petya can indeed prevent Vasya from making the sum on the board a natural number after any of his turns.

First, we convert the flow rate from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per minute (m/min): 4 kmph = 4,000 meters per hour Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide by 60 to get the flow rate per minute: 4,000 meters per hour ÷ 60 minutes per hour = 66.67 meters per minute Now we have the flow rate in meters per minute, we can calculate the volume of water flowing per minute using the cross-sectional area of the river and the flow rate. The cross-sectional area of the river (A) is given by the width (W) multiplied by the depth (D): A = W × D A = 75 m × 7 m A = 525 m² The volume of water (V) flowing per minute is the cross-sectional area (A) multiplied by the flow rate (R): V = A × R V = 525 m² × 66.67 meters per minute V = 35,001.75 m³ per minute Therefore, boxed{35,001.75} cubic meters of water runs into the sea per minute."},{"prompt":"For what real value of ( x ) is the expression ( 3x^2 18x + 7 ) minimized?","completion":"We start by writing the given quadratic expression and completing the square: [ 3x^2 - 18x + 7 = 3(x^2 - 6x) + 7. ] To complete the square in the parentheses: [ x^2 - 6x = (x^2 - 6x + 9) - 9 = (x - 3)^2 - 9. ] Substituting this back into the original expression: [ 3x^2 - 18x + 7 = 3((x - 3)^2 - 9) + 7 = 3(x - 3)^2 - 27 + 7 = 3(x - 3)^2 - 20. ] The minimum value of ( (x - 3)^2 ) is zero, as a square of a real number is never negative.

Since this is 10% of the already reduced price, we calculate 10% of 0.91P: 0.91P - 0.10 * 0.91P = 0.91P - 0.091P = 0.819P On the third day, the price is reduced by an additional 15%.

Similarly, O_2O_3 passes through B, O_3O_4 passes through C, and O_4O_1 passes through D. 3. **Use the property of tangency:** For two circles that are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii.

However, since 2a^{2} and a^{3} are not like terms (they have different exponents), they cannot be combined in the way suggested. Therefore, option A is incorrect. **Option B: a^{3}div a=a** Using the rules of exponents, when we divide two powers with the same base, we subtract the exponents: a^{3}div a = a^{3-1} = a^{2}.

Since theta is an angle in the third quadrant, we know that both sintheta and costheta are negative. We can rearrange the equation by subtracting costheta from both sides: [x^2 + y^2 sintheta - costheta = 0.] This equation does not immediately resemble the form of a conic section. However, we can compare this to the standard forms of the equations for an ellipse and a hyperbola: - Ellipse: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 with a, b > 0. - Hyperbola: frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 or frac{y^2}{b^2} - frac{x^2}{a^2} = 1 with a, b > 0. Here are the steps to transform our given equation into one of these forms: 1. Recognize that costheta is a constant. Call this constant C. Therefore, x^2 + y^2 sintheta - C = 0. 2. Since sintheta is negative, y^2 sintheta will be negative for any y neq 0. This is similar to a hyperbolic equation. 3. We can write y^2 (-|sintheta|) = y^2/b^2 for some positive b, where b^2 = frac{1}{|sintheta|}. 4. Let x^2 = x^2/a^2 where a^2 = 1. Once we set these equalities, the equation becomes frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = -C. To convert it to the standard form of a hyperbola, we divide everything by -C and get frac{x^2}{-Ca^2} - frac{y^2}{-Cb^2} = 1. Since both -Ca^2 and -Cb^2 are positive because C is negative, the equation is that of a hyperbola. The key distinction between choices C and D lies in the placement of the foci. In our case, since a^2 and b^2 are essentially \\"multipliers\\" of x^2 and y^2, and the x^2 term has a positive coefficient, the foci of the hyperbola are on the y-axis.

Martin's budget for both items is 1,500. 2. The TV is offered at 150 less than his budget for the TV. Since we don't know the original budget for the TV, let's call it T. So the TV is offered at T - 150. 3. The TV also has an additional 20% off. So the price of the TV after the discount is (T - 150) - 20% of (T - 150) = (T - 150) * (1 - 0.20) = (T - 150) * 0.80. 4. The sound system has a 15% discount. Let's call the original price of the sound system S. So the price after the discount is S - 15% of S = S * (1 - 0.15) = S * 0.85. 5. The store applies an 8% tax on the final price of both items. So the final price with tax for both items is [(T - 150) * 0.80 + S * 0.85] * 1.08. Now, we need to find out how much lower the final price is compared to Martin's budget of 1,500. Let's assume that Martin decided to spend exactly half of his budget on each item, so T = S = 750 (since 1,500 / 2 = 750). The price of the TV after the discount and before tax would be: (T - 150) * 0.80 = (750 - 150) * 0.80 = 600 * 0.80 = 480. The price of the sound system after the discount and before tax would be: S * 0.85 = 750 * 0.85 = 637.50. The combined price before tax would be: 480 + 637.50 = 1,117.50. Now, let's apply the 8% tax: 1,117.50 * 1.08 = 1,206.90. Finally, let's find out how much lower this is compared to Martin's budget of 1,500: 1,500 - 1,206.90 = 293.10.

He bought yellow balls three times the number of red balls he lost, so he bought 3 * 6 = 18 yellow balls. After all the transactions, Jamie had 74 balls in total. This includes the red, blue, and yellow balls. We don't count the green balls since he gave them away and they were not part of his initial collection. So, the total number of balls he has is the sum of the red, blue, and yellow balls: 10 (red) + 32 (blue) + 18 (yellow) = 60 balls. However, this total (60 balls) does not match the final total of 74 balls. It seems there might be a mistake in the calculation or the information provided.

The pencil is 12 centimeters long. 2. The pen is shorter than the pencil by 2 centimeters, so the pen is 12 - 2 = 10 centimeters long. 3. The pen is longer than the rubber by 3 centimeters, so the rubber is 10 - 3 = 7 centimeters long. 4. The ruler is 3 times the length of the rubber, so the ruler is 3 * 7 = 21 centimeters long. 5. The ruler is also 20% longer than the pen. Since the pen is 10 centimeters long, 20% of 10 centimeters is 2 centimeters. However, we already found the ruler to be 21 centimeters long, which is consistent because 21 centimeters is indeed 20% longer than 10 centimeters (20% of 10 centimeters is 2 centimeters, and 10 + 2 = 12 centimeters, but the ruler is 21 centimeters as previously calculated). 6. The marker is the average length of the pen, the rubber, and the pencil. So the marker's length is (10 + 7 + 12) / 3 = 29 / 3 = 9.67 centimeters. 7. The marker's length is half the length of the ruler. Since the ruler is 21 centimeters long, half of that is 10.5 centimeters. However, we already calculated the marker to be 9.67 centimeters long. There seems to be a discrepancy here, so let's re-evaluate the marker's length based on the information that it is half the length of the ruler. The marker should be 21 / 2 = 10.5 centimeters long. 8. A pair of scissors is 75% the length of the pencil. Since the pencil is 12 centimeters long, the scissors are 0.75 * 12 = 9 centimeters long. Now, let's add up the lengths of all the items: - Rubber: 7 centimeters - Pen: 10 centimeters - Pencil: 12 centimeters - Marker: 10.5 centimeters (based on the ruler's length) - Ruler: 21 centimeters - Scissors: 9 centimeters Total length = 7 + 10 + 12 + 10.5 + 21 + 9 = 69.5 centimeters So, the total length of the rubber, the pen, the pencil, the marker, the ruler, and the pair of scissors altogether is boxed{69.5} centimeters."},{"prompt":"For how many positive integers n less than or equal to 30 is n! evenly divisible by 1 + 2 + cdots + n?

Clearly, the maximum sum, ( S ), should satisfy ( S leq 140 ) since ( 10 times 14 = 140 ). 2. **Consider the Upper Bound**: Let’s assume ( S geq 134 ). We can denote ( S = 134 + m ) where ( 0 leq m leq 6 ). 3. **Ranking the Numbers**: We can choose eight numbers equal to 8, ( m ) numbers equal to 10, and ( 14 - m ) numbers equal to 9. At this stage, the total sum is ( 134 + m ). 4. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: For these 15 numbers, at least eight of them must sum up within a single group. The smallest sum of these eight numbers can be evaluated as follows: [ 1 times 8 + m times 9 + (7 - m) times 10 = 78 - m geq 72 ] This shows a contradiction since the minimum sum cannot be less than 72. 5. **Verifying for ( S leq 133 )**: We now demonstrate that if ( S leq 133 ), any sum ( S ) composed of numbers no greater than 10 can always be partitioned to meet the conditions.

Find the maximum possible value of k .","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Example:** - We are given 2021 points on a circle, each colored with one of ( k ) colors. - We need to find the maximum possible value of ( k ) such that for every color ( 1 leq r leq k ), there exists an arc where at least half of the points on it are colored with ( r ). - Example: If ( k = 2 ), we can color the points alternately with two colors, say 1 and 2. This configuration works because any arc containing half the points will have at least half of them colored with either color 1 or color 2. 2. **Proof that ( k leq 2 ):** - Assume for contradiction that ( k geq 3 ). - By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be a color that appears at most ( leftlceil frac{2021}{3} rightrceil = 674 ) times. Let this color be color 1. - The number of points not colored by 1 is at least ( 2021 - 674 = 1347 ). 3. **Definition of Arc ( Y_i ):** - For each point ( a_i ) not colored by 1, define ( Y_i ) as the shortest arc containing ( a_i ) such that at least half of the points on it are colored by 1. 4. **Claim 1: One endpoint of ( Y_i ) is ( a_i ):** - Suppose the contrary, and let the endpoints of ( Y_i ) be ( m ) and ( n ). - Let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( m ) and ( a_i ) (excluding ( a_i )), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1. - Similarly, let ( t_1 ) be the number of points between ( n ) and ( a_i ) (excluding ( a_i )), and ( t_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1. - We know ( z_2 < frac{z_1 + 1}{2} ) (otherwise, the arc from ( m ) to ( a_i ) would be shorter and suitable for ( a_i )). - Thus, ( z_2 leq frac{z_1}{2} ). - Similarly, ( t_2 leq frac{t_1}{2} ). - Therefore, ( z_2 + t_2 leq frac{z_1 + t_1}{2} ). - However, we also know ( z_2 + t_2 geq frac{z_1 + t_1 + 1}{2} ), leading to a contradiction. 5. **Claim 2: The second endpoint of ( Y_i ) is colored by 1:** - Suppose the contrary, and let the second endpoint of ( Y_i ) be ( m ), which is not colored by 1. - Let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( m ) and ( a_i ) (both included), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1. - We know ( z_2 geq frac{z_1}{2} ). - Removing ( m ) from the arc ( Y_i ) results in a shorter arc, and since ( z_2 > frac{z_1 - 1}{2} ), the new arc still satisfies the condition, leading to a contradiction. 6. **Claim 3: Exactly half of the points on ( Y_i ) are colored by 1:** - Suppose the contrary, and let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( a_i ) and ( b_i ) (both included), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1. - If ( z_2 > frac{z_1}{2} ), then ( z_2 geq frac{z_1 + 1}{2} ). - Removing ( b_i ) from the arc ( Y_i ) results in a shorter arc, and since ( z_2 - 1 geq frac{z_1 - 1}{2} ), the new arc still satisfies the condition, leading to a contradiction. 7. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:** - For each arc ( Y_i ), consider the point ( b_i ). All ( b_i ) points are colored by 1 (Claim 2). - There are at most 674 points colored by 1 and at least 1347 arcs. - By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least 3 arcs with the same endpoint. - WLOG, let ( Y_m, Y_n, Y_p ) have the same endpoint ( b_1 ). - These arcs are on the same circle and end at the same point, so there must be 2 arcs where one covers the other. - WLOG, let ( Y_m ) cover ( Y_n ). Let ( a_m ) and ( a_n ) be their starting points. - Let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( a_m ) and ( a_n ) (excluding ( a_n )), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1. - Let ( t_1 ) be the number of points between ( a_n ) and ( b_1 ) (both included), and ( t_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1. - By Claim 3, ( t_2 = frac{t_1}{2} ) (arc ( Y_n )) and ( z_2 + t_2 = frac{z_1 + t_1}{2} ) (arc ( Y_m )). - Thus, ( z_2 = frac{z_1}{2} ). - Consider the arc starting at ( a_m ) and ending just before ( a_n ) (arc ( Y_m - Y_n )). - On this arc, there are ( z_1 ) points and ( z_2 ) of them are colored by 1. - Since ( z_2 = frac{z_1}{2} ), this arc is suitable for ( a_m ), contradicting the assumption that ( Y_i ) was the shortest arc suitable for ( a_m ). 8. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, ( k leq 2 ).

If ( overrightarrow{A'C'} ) and ( overrightarrow{B'C'} ) are identical, it means ( A' = B' ).

Initially, ( V_{text{juice}} = 1 ) liter. 3. **First Pour Calculation**: - After pouring out 0.5 liters, the remaining juice in the 1-liter bottle is: [ V_{text{juice}} = frac{V_{text{juice}}}{2} = frac{1}{2} , text{liter} ] - Then he adds 0.5 liters of water, resulting in a total liquid volume of 1 liter again, but the orange juice part is ( frac{1}{2} ). 4. **Repetition of Operations**: - The process is repeated ( 10 ) times. Each time, the amount of orange juice left in the 1-liter bottle after mixing is halved again after pouring out half of it. After the second operation, the amount of orange juice becomes: [ V_{text{juice}} = frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} = left( frac{1}{2} right)^2 = frac{1}{4}, text{liter} ] After the third operation: [ V_{text{juice}} = left( frac{1}{2} right)^3 = frac{1}{8}, text{liter} ] And so on. 5. **General Formula**: - For ( n ) operations, the amount of orange juice left after each operation follows the exponential decay formula: [ V_{text{juice}} = left( frac{1}{2} right)^n ] After ( 10 ) operations, the volume of orange juice left is: [ V_{text{juice}} = left( frac{1}{2} right)^{10} = frac{1}{2^{10}} = frac{1}{1024}, text{liter} ] 6. **Final Calculation**: - After 10 operations, Illya pours the remaining content of the 1-liter bottle into the 19-liter bottle.

We need to show that there exist ( a, b in A ) such that ( ab > 1994 ). 2. **Prime factorization and size constraints:** Each integer in ( A ) can be expressed as a product of prime factors. Since ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ) for all ( x, y in A ), each integer in ( A ) must be composed of distinct sets of prime factors. 3. **Bounding the product:** Consider the largest possible product of two distinct integers in ( A ). Since ( gcd(x, y) = 1 ), the product ( ab ) will be the product of all the prime factors of ( a ) and ( b ). 4. **Prime number constraints:** The product of the first 16 prime numbers is extremely large.

However, with 16 integers, it is impossible to choose 16 distinct integers such that all pairs have a product less than or equal to 1994 without some pairs sharing common prime factors. 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, there must exist at least one pair of integers ( a ) and ( b ) in ( A ) such that ( gcd(a, b) > 1 ).

We need to show that we can place ( k-1 ) points such that every interval contains at least one of those points. 2. **Base case for induction:** For ( k = 2 ), the problem reduces to Helly's theorem, which states that for a finite collection of intervals, if every pair of intervals has a non-empty intersection, then there is a common point that intersects all intervals. Thus, for ( k = 2 ), we can place 1 point that intersects all intervals. 3. **Inductive hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for ( k-1 ).

Here, a is a fixed number within the range 0 to 6. The problem then translates to ensuring that for any k when we place the lamp in the plug, there is at least one contact matching its correctly numbered hole. 3. **Converting to Modular Arithmetic**: The problem involves modular arithmetic since we are working with circular ordering (modulo 7).

Note that multiplying any number by 2 modulo 7 cycles through all possible residues modulo 7 because 2 and 7 are coprime (i.e., gcd(2,7) = 1). Therefore, for each a, there exists a residue k such that: [ k equiv frac{a}{2} pmod{7} ] 5. **Verifying Solution**: When k takes all values from 0 to 6, 2k will span all values from 0 to 6 modulo 7 as k does.

A) Horizontal line at r followed by an upward linear segment. B) Horizontal line at r followed by a downward linear segment. C) Downward slope from a height above r to r followed by an upward slope. D) Continuous wavelike pattern.","completion":"1. **Circular Path from A to B via D**: The ship starts at A, moves to D, and returns to B (which is the same as A). Throughout this path, the distance from the ship to Island X is constantly r because the ship remains on the edge of the circle centered at X. 2. **Distance Representation for A to B**: As the ship moves along the circle, the distance to Island X remains constant, so this part of the graph is represented by a horizontal line at height r. 3. **Travel from B to C**: Upon leaving the circular path, the ship travels in a straight line from B to C. During this segment, the ship initially moves away from Island X. Assuming the path is a direct line away from the island, the distance increases linearly from B to C. 4. **Graph Representation for BC**: The graph from B to C will be a linear upward slope, starting from r and increasing as the ship moves away from Island X. 5. **Complete Graph Analysis**: The full graph will show a horizontal line from A to B at height r, followed by a rising line from B to C.

What is the minimum number of pairs of acquainted residents in Beryozovka?","completion":"Let's proceed step-by-step to solve this problem which is about finding the minimum number of pairs of acquainted residents in a village, given certain acquaintance constraints. 1. **Initial Assumption and Setup**: Given there are 200 residents in Berezovka, we need to determine the minimum number of pairs of acquainted residents such that any six of them can be seated in a round table where each resident knows their immediate neighbors on both sides. 2. **Literary Digression to Pigeonholes**: Suppose there exists a resident, call him Vasya, who does not know at least four other residents. Consider selecting a group of six people consisting of Vasya, those four people he does not know, and one random additional person. In this scenario, it is impossible to arrange them around a round table such that Vasya knows both his neighbors, because at least one of those four will end up next to Vasya. 3. **Disproof of Non-compliance**: Since the above assumption contradicts the given condition (that any six residents can be seated as described), it means that every resident must know all but at most three other residents. Therefore, each resident is acquainted with at least (200 - 4 = 196) people. 4. **Calculation**: We calculate the minimum number of pairs of acquainted residents using the formula for counting pairs: [ frac{200 times 196}{2} = 19600 ] 5. **Verification by Example**: Let's now illustrate that exactly 19600 pairs of acquainted residents are possible.

Denote the residents as (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{200}). 6. **Detailed Verification**: Let's take any group of 6 residents, say (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6). Given that no pair of residents differ by exactly 99, 100, or 101, all residents in this group are acquainted with their neighbors on the circle: - Verify that (A_i) is friends with (A_{i-1}) and (A_{i+1}) for each (i). - Check their adjacency using the metric mentioned (that they're not strangers to those who differ by 99, 100, or 101). 7. **Proof Conclusion**: By setting the seating arrangement of 200 residents in a large circle and ensuring each knows every other person except the three abrupt exceptions, we prove that the minimum number of pairs can be precisely 19600, while still fulfilling the seating arrangement condition mentioned.

We need to show that the line ( l(S, PQR) ) contains the point [ Z = frac{P + Q + R + S}{2}. ] We denote the feet of the perpendiculars from ( S ) to the sides ( QR ), ( RP ), and ( PQ ) by ( P' ), ( Q' ), and ( R' ) respectively. 2. **Representation of Perpendicular Foot (P'):** Since ( P' ) lies on ( QR ), we have: [ frac{P' - Q}{R - Q} = overline{left( frac{P' - Q}{R - Q} right)}, ] which implies [ (P' - Q)(overline{R - Q}) = (overline{P'} - overline{Q})(R - Q). ] 3. **Perpendicularity Condition:** Because ( SP' ) is perpendicular to ( QR ), the ratio [ frac{P' - S}{R - Q} ] is purely imaginary. Thus: [ (P' - S)(overline{R - Q}) = -(overline{P'} - overline{S})(R - Q). ] 4. **Eliminating (overline{P'}):** By substituting the unit circle property, (overline{X} = frac{1}{X}), we eliminate (overline{P'}) from the equations and solve to find [ P' = frac{Q + R + S - frac{QR}{S}}{2}. ] Similarly, [ Q' = frac{P + R + S - frac{PR}{S}}{2}, ] and [ R' = frac{P + Q + S - frac{PQ}{S}}{2}. ] 5. **Point ( Z ) and Collinearity:** Let's compute the differences involving ( Z ): [ Z - P' = frac{P + QR / S}{2}, quad Z - Q' = frac{Q + PR / S}{2}, quad Z - R' = frac{R + PQ / S}{2}. ] Each difference shows that the ratios are real because ( x + x^{-1} = 2 , text{Re}(x) ) is real for all ( x ) on the unit circle.

This is because, in the simplest case, if there is 1 high-value box and 1 other box, the chance of picking the high-value box is 1/2. Extending this logic, if there are 7 high-value boxes, there should be 7 other boxes left to maintain the 1/2 probability. 3. **Calculate the number of boxes to eliminate:** Initially, there are 26 boxes in total. If we need to end up with 7 high-value boxes and 7 other boxes, that's a total of 14 boxes that must remain.

This ensures the largest possible difference between numbers at subsequent stages. 3. **Implementation**: - **First move**: Player 1 crosses out 512 numbers. A reasonable strategy could be crossing out every second number. Thus, only odd or even numbers remain, creating a difference of at least 2 between each remaining neighbor. - **Subsequent moves**: Continue this pattern by crossing out numbers to maintain the spread. For instance: - **Second move**: Player 1 crosses out 128 numbers, maintaining an increasing minimum difference between adjacent numbers. - **Third move**: Cross out 64 numbers, and so on. Let's demonstrate mathematically: - After the 1st move, remaining numbers' difference between any two neighbors is at least 2. - After the 2nd move, it's at least 4. - After the 3rd move, it's at least 8. - Continue in this pattern until the 5th move, where the difference will be at least 32.

Player 2's (Second Wise Man) Strategy: 1. **Objective**: Player 2 aims to minimize the payment, i.e., the difference between the final two numbers. 2. **Method**: At each step, Player 2 should aim to keep the numbers as close as possible, focusing on crossing out the extreme numbers in the range left. 3. **Implementation**: - **First move**: Player 2 crosses out numbers beyond a central point (e.g., all numbers greater than 512 or less than 512). This ensures that the remaining range is halved. - **Subsequent moves**: Continuously reduce the spread by keeping numbers within a smaller range. For instance: - **Second move**: Focus on a smaller central range within [0, 256] or [768, 1024], reducing the spread to a smaller interval. - Continue this pattern until after 5 moves, the numbers will be confined to an interval with a difference of at most 32. Through this strategy: - After the 1st move, reduce the potential maximum difference to 512. - After the 2nd move, reduce it further to 256. - Continue reducing at each subsequent step until, by the 5th move, the difference is constrained to no more than 32. Conclusion: If both players follow their optimal strategies, - Player 1 ensures the difference between the two final numbers is no less than 32 by spreading out numbers at every move. - Player 2 ensures the difference between the two final numbers is no more than 32 by confining numbers to progressively smaller intervals.

This problem primarily tests understanding of the definition and properties of arithmetic sequences and the judgement of the triangular shape. It is a moderate-difficulty question. **Step-by-step solution** Given triangle ABC, we have 2b = a + c (equation 1), and 2sqrt{b} = sqrt{a} + sqrt{c} (equation 2).

If we assume all squares to be colored like this, then all vertices that are part of the chain must be of one color (say black). 6. **Vertex and diagonal count**: In the cube setup, there are certain vertices of the entire cube that will be used by the diagonal chain: - A (3 times 3 times 3) cube has vertices of degree 3 (inner vertices in our diagonal cross-chain model). - Let's count vertex usage in terms of the cube where each face alignment will have the diagonally connected vertices using the vertices of the (3 times 3) grid within the large cube's faces. 7. **Odd vertices contradiction**: Consider that among the vertices where our hypothetical black vertices are the diagonals' endpoints, four of these vertices belong to the corners of the cube, forming vertices with three edge connections each (odd degree). Having four such vertices while the rest have even degrees creates a contradiction because according to graph theory, an Eulerian path (path that visits every edge exactly once) requires exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. **Conclusion**: This leads us to a contradiction. Therefore, it is **not possible** to fully cover the (3 times 3 times 3) cube's surface with 54 unit squares arranged in a single chain. [ boxed{text{No}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let ( k > 1 ) be an integer.

Number the people such that these four liars have the first four positions, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4. - According to the first liar (position 1), among the next 11 people (positions 2-12), there should be at least 9 liars. - Since we know there are at most 3 knights in any group of 12 consecutive people and here positions 2-4 are liars, there must be exactly 3 knights among positions 5-12. - Similarly, observe the group from positions 5 to 16.

To prove this, we can use **Ptolemy's Theorem**, which states: For any cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD), AC cdot BD = AB cdot CD + AD cdot BC. We now apply **Ptolemy's Theorem** to the cyclic quadrilateral (APQR): 1. **Applying Ptolemy’s Theorem:** [ AP cdot RQ + AR cdot QP = AQ cdot PR. ] 2. **Identifying similar triangles:** We know that ( angle ACB = angle RAQ ) and ( angle RPQ = angle BAC ) since both pairs are subtended by the same arc in the cyclic quadrilateral. Next, observe that [ angle RQP = 180^circ - angle PAR = angle ABC. ] Hence, triangles ( triangle RQP ) and ( triangle ABC ) are similar by the criteria ( angle RQP = angle ABC ), ( angle RPQ = angle BAC ). 3. **Establishing similarity ratios:** From the similarity, [ frac{RQ}{QP} = frac{AB}{BC}. ] 4. **Comparing lengths:** Note that in the parallelogram (ABCD), (BC = AD). That is, [ frac{RQ}{QP} = frac{AB}{AD}. ] 5. **Concluding the equalities:** The similar triangles imply a constant ratio of segment products at points (P), (Q), and (R).

Let (O) be the center of mass of this system of points. 2. **Center of Mass Calculation:** Consider the system of three point masses of 1 unit each placed at (A), (B), and (C). The center of mass (O), by definition, is the point that satisfies: [ vec{O} = frac{vec{A} + vec{B} + vec{C}}{3} ] 3. **Median from Vertex (A):** To show that the medians intersect at (O) and divide it in the ratio (2:1), consider the median from (A) to the midpoint (A_1) of the side (BC). Since (A_1) is the midpoint of (BC), we have: [ vec{A_1} = frac{vec{B} + vec{C}}{2} ] 4. **Two-Point System (A) and (A_1):** Consider the system consisting of point (A) with mass 1 and point (A_1) with mass 2 (the combined mass of points (B) and (C)). The center of mass (O) of this two-point system is given by: [ vec{O} = frac{1cdot vec{A} + 2 cdot vec{A_1}}{1+2} = frac{vec{A} + 2 cdot frac{vec{B} + vec{C}}{2}}{3} = frac{vec{A} + vec{B} + vec{C}}{3} ] which means: [ vec{O} = frac{vec{A} + vec{B} + vec{C}}{3} ] 5. **Dividing the Median Segment:** Since (vec{O}) is consistent with the center of mass of the triangle (ABC), it must lie on the median (AA_1). Moreover, the ratio in which (O) divides (AA_1) can be calculated by the distances. Let (G) (the centroid) divide (AA_1) in such a way that: [ AG:GA_1 = 2:1 ] This is a textbook definition of the centroid in a triangle. 6. **Repeating the Process for Other Medians:** The same reasoning applies for the medians from (B) to (B_1) (midpoint of (AC)) and from (C) to (C_1) (midpoint of (AB)). The center of mass (O) is the same for these configurations and it divides each median in the same ratio **2:1**. Conclusion: Hence, it is proved that the medians of a triangle intersect at a single point, called the centroid, which divides each median in the ratio (2:1) from the vertex.

Thus, there are 10 lattice points on side OB (excluding point O but including point B). - On side AB: The equation of line AB is y = -x + 30. For 0 < x < 20 and x an integer, y is also an integer. Therefore, there are 19 lattice points on side AB (excluding endpoints). Combining these, we find L = 31 + 10 + 19 = 60. 2. **Finding the area S of triangle ABO:** The area S can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle, S = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. Here, the base is 20 (the length from O to B) and the height is 30 (the length from O to A), so S = frac{1}{2} times 30 times 20 = 300. 3. **Applying Pick's theorem to find N:** Substituting the values of S and L into Pick's theorem, we get 300 = N + frac{1}{2} times 60 - 1. Solving for N, we find: [ N = 300 - frac{1}{2} times 60 + 1 = 300 - 30 + 1 = 271. ] Therefore, the number of lattice points inside triangle ABO is boxed{271}, which corresponds to choice boxed{C}."},{"prompt":"A sequence of figures is formed using tiles.

Because the line is closed: [ mathbf{a} + mathbf{b} + mathbf{c} + mathbf{d} + mathbf{e} + mathbf{f} = mathbf{0} ] 2. **Grouping Perpendicular Vectors:** Rearrange the vectors such that each pair of perpendicular vectors appears adjacent to each other.

Consider a sequence of four consecutive coins. We need to check the validity of the constraints: - In four consecutive coins, there can: - Be at most one 3-kopek coin (since there must be at least three coins between any two 3-kopek coins). - Be at most two 2-kopek coins (since there must be at least two coins between any two 2-kopek coins). - There can be three 1-kopek coins, but at least one other coin to ensure a coin between two 1-kopek coins.

Given the isosceles trapezoid properties, we can denote the relationships involving segments intersecting at (O): [ 2(AO + OB) = AC + BD < 2(BC + AD) ] 3. **Applying Similarity of Triangles:** - Due to the similarity of the isosceles triangles (BOC) and (AOD), derived from the angle bisectors and equal lengths in the trapezoid, we analyze the segment relationships: [ BO < BC ] - This inequality arises from the fact that (BOC) is a smaller segment lying within (BC) as diagonals intersect at (O). 4. **Angle Analysis in Triangle (BOC):** - In triangle (BOC), we are to find the largest angle. Since (BO < BC), the triangle properties and segment relationships lead us to identify that the angle formed at (O), (angle BOC), is greater than 60 degrees. - By triangle properties and internal angle relations, the angles adjust accordingly to this relationship. 5. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, from the established inequalities and triangle properties within the trapezoid, we conclude: [ angle BOC > 60^circ ] Thus, [ boxed{angle BOC > 60^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"What least number should be added to some number, so that the sum is completely divisible by 23? The answer is 6. What is the original number?","completion":"Let's call the original number \\"x\\". We are told that when we add 6 to x, the result is completely divisible by 23. This means that: x + 6 = 23k where k is some integer because the sum is divisible by 23. To find the original number x, we need to find a value of k such that x + 6 is a multiple of 23. Since we don't have the exact multiple, we can express x in terms of k: x = 23k - 6 Now, we need to find the smallest non-negative value of k such that x is also a non-negative integer. Since 6 is the least number to be added, it implies that before adding 6, the remainder when x was divided by 23 was 23 - 6 = 17. Therefore, the original number x, when divided by 23, left a remainder of 17. This means that x is of the form: x = 23k + 17 To find the smallest non-negative k that satisfies this, we can start with k = 0 and increase k until we find a value that makes x + 6 divisible by 23. For k = 0: x = 23(0) + 17 = 17 Now, let's check if 17 + 6 is divisible by 23: 17 + 6 = 23 23 is divisible by 23, so k = 0 is the correct value.

We need to find and prove the nature of an initial grid configuration that can be transformed, through a finite number of operations, so that all numbers in the grid become zero. 1. **Coloring the Grid:** Color the grid in a checkerboard pattern, where black cells alternate with white cells. Notice that any operation involving two adjacent cells always involves one black cell and one white cell. 2. **Defining the Sum:** Let ( M ) be the sum of the numbers in the black cells and ( N ) be the sum of the numbers in the white cells. Define ( S = M - N ). 3. **Invariant Property:** Observe that each time an operation is performed, both ( M ) and ( N ) increase by the same value.

This procedure will turn all numbers in the first row to zero. - Continue this procedure for the second row paired again in the adjacent column pairs, converting the second row to zeros, keeping all previously zeroed rows unaffected. - Proceed similarly for all subsequent rows until all rows except the last one are zero. 6. **Following with the Last Row:** - Now, continue with the last row, pairing the first and second columns, the third and fourth columns, etc., to bring the first ( n-1 ) cells to zero. - Given ( S = 0 ) and the invariant property, when all cells except the last cell turn zero, the sum of black cells and white cells being equal (both zero implies that the last cell must also be zero). Therefore, we have shown both: - The necessity: ( S = 0 ) is needed for all cells to become zero. - The sufficiency: given ( S = 0 ), a finite series of operations will make all cell values zero.

Additionally, each vertex of the column should have columns of three different colors converging. We need to check the feasibility of this for ( n = 1995 ) and ( n = 1996 ). 1. **Case ( n = 1995 ):** - **Step 1:** We first paint the upper and lower edges of a column. Given that ( 1995 ) is divisible by ( 3 ) (since ( 1995 = 3 cdot 665 )), we can assign the colors cyclically: (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ldots). - **Step 2:** Then, we paint the lower edges such that they match the colors of the corresponding upper edges. - **Step 3:** Once the upper and lower edges are painted, each face of the column would have unique colors on its three sides.

Suppose there was a way to color such that all lower and upper edges and side edges meet the requirements, there would be a necessity to ensure the cyclic color pattern is preserved. - **Step 4:** Since this is not divisible into equal cycles, and distinct colors at each vertex are required, we will find at least one color repeating incorrectly in any attempt to loop through ( 1996 ) edges, breaking required conditions.

This intersection point lies inside the circle (and not at the vertices). 4. **Counting Unique Intersections:** The number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of ( n ) vertices is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{4} ).

We need to show that there is always a way to move a marble if (k < 2024). 3. **Free Rows and Columns:** - Since there are fewer than 2024 marbles, there will be rows and columns without any marbles, called **free** rows and columns. - Let (p) be the number of free columns and (q) be the number of free rows. Without loss of generality, assume (p geq q). 4. **Claim 1: No Two Free Rows are Adjacent:** - If there were two adjacent free rows, there must be a marble adjacent to this block. Moving this marble into the block would create a valid arrangement, contradicting the assumption. 5. **Claim 2: The Leftmost Column is Not Free:** - If the leftmost column were free, moving a marble from the next column to the leftmost column would create a valid arrangement, contradicting the assumption. 6. **Marbles in Non-Free Columns:** - For each free column, the column immediately to the left contains a marble. If a marble is at ((x, y)), there must be another marble at ((x+2, y)) to prevent moving the marble to ((x+1, y)). 7. **Counting Marbles and Rows:** - There are (p) free columns, so there are at least (p) pairs of marbles with a distance vector ((2, 0)). These pairs use up (p) rows. - The remaining (2024 - n - 2p) marbles can use at most (2024 - n - 2p) rows. - Therefore, at most (p + (2024 - n - 2p) = 2024 - n - p) rows have marbles, implying at least (p + n) rows are free. 8. **Contradiction:** - Since (p geq q), the number of free rows (q) must be at least (p + n), which is a contradiction. Thus, the largest value of (k) such that for all arrangements of (k) marbles, we can move one marble to a neighboring cell and still satisfy the conditions is (k = 2023).

Let’s consider the possible moves: - Doubling 2017 would yield ( 2 times 2017 = 4034 ), which makes the player lose because 4034 is not less than 4000. - Subtracting 1000 from 2017 gives ( 2017 - 1000 = 1017 ). 4. **Determine next potential moves**: - Starting at 1017, we again verify the possible moves: - Doubling 1017 results in ( 2 times 1017 = 2034 ), which is within the safe range (1000, 4000). - Subtracting 1000 from 1017 gives ( 1017 - 1000 = 17 ), resulting in a loss because 17 is not greater than 1000. 5. **Backtrack and verify all remaining possibilities**: - If we continue with 2034: - Doubling 2034 results in ( 2 times 2034 = 4068 ), which is not within the safe range. - Subtracting 1000 from 2034 results in ( 2034 - 1000 = 1034 ), still within the safe range. 6. **Conclusion from the analysis**: - Players can switch between the safe intervals by alternating the operations, ensuring they avoid the critical boundary numbers (1000 and 4000). - Since ( x = 2000 ) is an unique critical point and their operation moves can revert them back to another safe interval without ever hitting 2000 due to divisibility, it keeps the game going indefinitely.

The probability of drawing the first red marble is frac{4}{15}, since there are 4 red marbles out of a total of 15 marbles. After drawing one red marble, there are now 14 marbles left, and 3 of them are red. Thus, the probability of drawing a second red marble is frac{3}{14}. Similarly, after drawing two red marbles, there are 13 marbles left, with 2 of them being red, making the probability of drawing a third red marble frac{2}{13}.

Therefore, the two other roots are: x_2 = 2 + sqrt{4 - m}, and x_3 = 2 - sqrt{4 - m}. Since these three roots must form the sides of a triangle, with x_2 being the longest side, the triangle inequality theorem must be satisfied: x_1 + x_3 > x_2. Substituting the values we get: 2 + (2 - sqrt{4 - m}) > 2 + sqrt{4 - m}, which simplifies to: 4 - sqrt{4 - m} > sqrt{4 - m}. Upon squaring both sides: (4 - sqrt{4 - m})^2 > (sqrt{4 - m})^2, yielding: 16 - 8sqrt{4 - m} + 4 - m > 4 - m, that is: 16 - 8sqrt{4 - m} > 0, and finally: sqrt{4 - m} < 2.

It cannot be 0, so we actually require: 0 < sqrt{4 - m}, which gives us m < 4.

The total earnings over the 19 weeks can be calculated by summing up the earnings for each week.

This contradicts our assumption. Hence, (0 notin X). 3. **Induction base cases**: - For (n = 1): The set (X) has (n + 2 = 3) elements, each of absolute value at most 1. The possible elements are ({-1, 1}). Clearly, there must be a repetition, and thus (a + b = c) for some (a, b, c in X). - For (n = 2): The set (X) has (n + 2 = 4) elements, each of absolute value at most 2. The possible elements are ({-2, -1, 1, 2}).

Utilizing widehat{OAB} = widehat{OBA}, denote this common angle by alpha. Thus: widehat{BOA} + 2alpha = 180^circ. Therefore: widehat{BOA} = 180^circ - 2alpha. 5. **Use the theorem of the central angle:** - By the theorem of the central angle and inscribed angle, the angle subtended by the arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the remaining part of the circle: widehat{BCA} = frac{1}{2} widehat{BOA} = frac{1}{2} (180^circ - 2alpha) = 90^circ - alpha. 6. **Considering the orthocenter and altitude AD:** - At the orthocenter H, the altitude AD is perpendicular to BC; therefore: widehat{HAC} = widehat{DAC}. Now, widehat{DAC} is the complement of widehat{DCA} since they are angles of right triangle ADC. 7. **Relationship with widehat{DCA} and widehat{BCA}:** - Therefore, we have: widehat{DAC} = 90^circ - widehat{DCA}. Noticing that widehat{DCA}, as an exterior angle at A in triangle ABC, is equal to widehat{BCA} (since D lies on BC), we write: widehat{DCA} = widehat{BCA}. 8. **Expressing widehat{BCA} in terms of alpha:** - From earlier, we have: widehat{BCA} = 90^circ - alpha. 9. **Deriving widehat{HAC}:** - Hence: widehat{HAC} = 90^circ - widehat{DCA} = 90^circ - (90^circ - alpha) = alpha. 10. **Summary and conclusion:** - Finally, alpha = widehat{BAO}, so: widehat{BAO} = alpha.

First, let's denote the areas of the triangles: [ S_{triangle CDF} = 3, quad S_{triangle BCD} = 7, quad S_{triangle BDE} = 7 ] 2. Since the heights from D to lines CF and BC in triangles triangle CDF and triangle BCD are equal, the ratio of their areas corresponds to the ratio of segments FD and DB.

Based on this, we can examine the options: - The imaginary part of z is indeed 4i, but the option A is not correctly formulated to match our finding. - The conjugate of z is 1 - 4i, which matches option B. - To find |z|, we would calculate sqrt{1^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{17}, so option C is incorrect. - Since the real part of z is positive and the imaginary part is also positive, z lies in the first quadrant, not the second, making option D incorrect.

It is forbidden to write a number that has already been written. Petya starts. If after a player's move there are three numbers on the board that form an arithmetic progression, that player wins. Who has a strategy to guarantee a win? # Steps: 1. **First Step Analysis**: - Consider the situation after the third move (when three numbers are written). - If nobody has won after the third move, Vasya wins with the next move. It is sufficient for him to identify two written numbers of the same parity and write their arithmetic mean on his turn, ensuring the arithmetic mean is an integer. 2. **Observation**: - Note that if three integers from the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 2018}) form an arithmetic progression, their common difference is at most (frac{2018}{2} = 1009). This is because the largest difference would break the sequence constraint given the number range. 3. **Winning Strategy for Vasya**: - Suppose on the first move, Petya writes the number (a). - If (a leqslant 1009), Vasya should write one of 2017 or 2018, choosing the one whose parity is different from (a). Let's denote this number as (b). - After this move, there are two numbers of different parities written. Hence, they cannot be the first and third terms of an arithmetic progression of integers. - Moreover, since (b - a geq 1009), they also cannot be consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression, preventing Petya from creating a progression by the third move. - Thus, Petya cannot win on his third move, and Vasya, with his next move, guarantees a win by completing the needed progression. 4. **Adjusting for (a geq 1010)**: - If (a geqslant 1010), Vasya should then write either 1 or 2, depending on the parity of (a), picking the number with the opposite parity. - The reasoning follows similar lines as in the previous case—ensuring Petya cannot form an arithmetic progression by his third move.

Prove that the area of quadrilateral ABCD is equal to (AB cdot CD + BC cdot AD) / 2.","completion":"1. Consider quadrilateral (ABCD) which is inscribed in a circle and has perpendicular diagonals. Let the diagonals intersect at point (O). 2. We need to show that the area of (ABCD) is given by the formula: [ text{Area of } ABCD = frac{AB cdot CD + BC cdot AD}{2} ] 3. First, construct a point (D') on the circle such that line segment (DD') is parallel to diagonal (AC). Since (DD') is parallel to (AC) and they are both chords of the circle, it follows that (DD') is a perpendicular bisector to (BD). 4. Because (DD') is perpendicular to (BD), this means (BD') is a diameter of the circle. Therefore, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, (angle D'AB = 90^circ) and (angle D'CB = 90^circ). 5. Using the fact that (D') is a reflection of (D) about point (O), the diagonals (AC) and (BD') split the quadrilateral (ABCD') into four right triangles: (triangle ABD', triangle D'BC, triangle BCO, triangle OAD). 6. The area of quadrilateral (ABCD') can be found by summing the areas of these triangles: [ S_{ABCD'} = S_{triangle ABD'} + S_{triangle D'BC} + S_{triangle BCO} + S_{triangle OAD} ] 7. In the right triangle (triangle ABD'), the area is: [ S_{triangle ABD'} = frac{1}{2} cdot AB cdot AD' ] 8.

Consider the given problem where M is the midpoint of the arc AB of the circumcircle of triangle ABC that does not contain point C, and N is the midpoint of the arc BC of the circumcircle of triangle ABC that does not contain point A. 2. By definition, midpoints of arcs in the circumcircle of a triangle have significant symmetrical properties. Notably, these points are associated with the Lemma on the Three-leaf Clover (Lemmas o Trilistnike), which states that special centers such as the circumcenter, incenter, excenters, and arc midpoints of a triangle form isosceles triangles with respect to each other. 3. Let us denote by O the circumcenter of triangle ABC. Note that O is equidistant from A, B, and C. Consequently, the points M and N lie on a circle centered at O due to the property that they are midpoints of arcs in this circumcircle not containing the respective opposite vertex. 4. Now, center O also implies that the line segment from the center O to the midpoint of an arc is perpendicular to the chord connecting the endpoints of the arc.

This implies P and Q are situated critical distances maintaining perpendicularity. 7. Similarly, according to the construction and symmetrical properties, the segment MN which connects these midpoints also holds perpendicularity to BI, because triangles formed, such as MBI and NBI, are isosceles with shared base BI. 8.

Focus on a specific color and note that each cell of this color must have an arrow pointing in one of the four directions (top, bottom, left, or right) to indicate the direction where there isn't another cell of the same color. 4. For cells along the boundary of the grid: - Each boundary cell, except for the corner cells, can have at most one arrow indicating a missing same-colored cell. - Each corner cell can have at most two arrows since such a cell is bound by only two edges. 5. There are 4n - 4 boundary cells in a grid of size n times n, where n = 50 in this case. 6. Given that there are four colors, the number of cells of each color can be roughly distributed equally, resulting in no more than 4n boundary cells per color. 7. Another way to quantify this: - Each internal cell of the grid contributes to the count where same-colored adjacent cells might exist. - Overall, you would need more than just the boundary arrow considerations to satisfy the assumption without violating the coloring criteria. 8. Mathematically, the total requirement for satisfying the assumption (every cell having at least one non-same color neighbor) results in the inequality: [ n^2 leq 4 cdot 4n ] 9. For n = 50, we have: [ 50^2 leq 4 cdot 4 cdot 50 ] 10. Simplify the inequality: [ 2500 leq 800 ] 11. Clearly, the inequality 2500 leq 800 is false.

Let's consider a square with vertices ((0, 0)), ((1, 0)), ((1, 1)), and ((0, 1)). 2. **Cardinality of the Unit Interval:** According to problem 39.21, the set of all points on the unit interval ([0,1]) has the cardinality of the continuum. This set can be shown to be equinumerous with the set of infinite sequences (a_1, a_2, ldots) where (a_i = 0) or (1). Formally, we can express points on ([0, 1]) in terms of binary expansions. For example, each number (x in [0, 1]) can be written as: [ x = 0.a_1a_2a_3ldots quad text{where } a_i in {0, 1}. ] 3. **Cartesian Product of the Unit Interval:** A point in the square can be represented by a pair ((x, y)) where (x) and (y) are points in ([0, 1]). Given that ([0,1] times [0,1]) forms the square, we need to show that this Cartesian product has the cardinality of the continuum. 4. **Cardinality of Ordered Pairs of Sequences:** We know from set theory that the set of all ordered pairs ((x, y)) where (x) and (y) are each points in ([0,1]) also has the cardinality of the continuum. To see why, consider pairs of binary sequences ( (a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots) ) and ( (b_1, b_2, b_3, ldots) ). We can interleave these sequences to form a new sequence as follows: [ c = (a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3, ldots). ] 5. **Establishing a Bijection:** The interleaved sequence (c) uniquely represents the pair of sequences ((a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots)) and ((b_1, b_2, b_3, ldots)). Because each infinite binary sequence corresponds to a real number in ([0, 1]), there is a bijection between the set of pairs of sequences and the set of real numbers in ([0, 1] times [0, 1]). This bijection establishes that the set of points in the square ([0, 1] times [0, 1]) has the same cardinality as the set of points in ([0, 1]). # Conclusion: Therefore, the set of all points in a square indeed has the power of the continuum.

The time to complete the remaining distance after speeding up is calculated as follows: text{Time} = frac{text{Remaining Distance}}{text{Speed after speeding up}} = frac{180 - x}{1.5x} = frac{360 - 2x}{3x} text{ h} Therefore, the time it takes to complete the remaining distance after speeding up, directly in terms of x, is boxed{frac{360-2x}{3x} text{ h}}. Part (2): Finding the Actual Time for the Entire Journey According to the problem, the car arrives 40 minutes (frac{40}{60} hours) earlier than planned. The equation that represents the time difference is: frac{180-x}{x} - frac{360-2x}{3x} = frac{40}{60} Solving this equation for x: x = 60 text{ km/h} To find the actual time it takes for the car to complete the entire journey, we substitute x = 60 km/h into the equation: frac{180}{x} - frac{40}{60} = frac{180}{60} - frac{2}{3} = frac{7}{3} text{ h} Therefore, the actual time it takes for the car to complete the entire journey is boxed{frac{7}{3} text{ h}}. Part (3): Comparing t_{1} and t_{2} For the return journey, we have two scenarios: - t_{1}: Driving half the distance at a km/h and the other half at b km/h. - t_{2}: Driving half the time at a km/h and the other half at b km/h. Calculating t_{1} and t_{2}: t_{1} = frac{90}{a} + frac{90}{b} = frac{90(a+b)}{ab} t_{2} = frac{360}{a+b} Comparing t_{1} and t_{2}: frac{90(a+b)}{ab} - frac{360}{a+b} = frac{90(a-b)^{2}}{ab(a+b)} Since a and b are positive and a neq b, we have: (a-b)^{2} > 0 quad text{and} quad ab(a+b) > 0 Therefore, it follows that: frac{90(a-b)^{2}}{ab(a+b)} > 0 This implies that t_{1} > t_{2}, meaning the time taken when driving half the distance at different speeds is greater than when driving half the time at different speeds.

( f(x) + g(x) + f(x) + g(x) ) is an even function. Among these statements, which one is correct?","completion":"1. To determine if option (A) is correct, we need to check if (f(x) + g(x)) is a periodic function. Let the periods of (f(x)) and (g(x)) be (T_1) and (T_2) respectively. For (f(x) + g(x)) to be periodic, there must exist a common period which is the least common multiple (LCM) of (T_1) and (T_2). Hence, ( frac{T_1}{T_2} ) must be a rational number for (f(x) + g(x)) to be periodic. Since no such condition is given, we cannot guarantee that (f(x) + g(x)) is periodic. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect. 2. Next, consider option (B): [ f(x) + g(x) - |f(x) - g(x)| = begin{cases} 2g(x), & text{if } f(x) geq g(x), 2f(x), & text{if } f(x) < g(x) end{cases} = 2 min {f(x), g(x)} ] Given that both (f(x)) and (g(x)) are strictly increasing on the interval ([-1, 1]), the function ( min { f(x), g(x) } ) will also be strictly increasing on ([-1, 1]). Since (2) is a positive constant, multiplying it by (min { f(x), g(x) }) will preserve the strictly increasing nature. Therefore, ( f(x) + g(x) - | f(x) - g(x) | ) is strictly increasing on ([-1, 1]). Thus, option (B) is correct. 3. For option (C), we are asked whether (f(g(x))) is strictly increasing on the interval ([-1, 1]): Since (g(x)) is strictly increasing on ([-1, 1]), it maps ([-1, 1]) to some interval ([a, b]). We are not given explicit information about the range of (g(x)) and the domain of (f(x)). However, for (f) to apply, (g(x)) must map into the domain of (f(x)), which cannot be certain lies within ([-1,1]). To claim that (f(g(x))) is strictly increasing, we need the strictly increasing nature of (f) and (g) to align within the relevant intervals strictly, which is not guaranteed. Hence, option (C) is incorrect. 4. Finally, analyze option (D): We need to determine whether (f(x) + g(x) + f(-x) + g(-x)) is an even function. A function (h(x)) is even if ( h(x) = h(-x)) for all (x) in its domain.

(The answer should be an integer, without spaces or units of measure.)","completion":"To determine the price at which Oleg should sell each kettle, we need to consider both the variable and fixed costs and ensure that the revenue covers these costs plus the desired profit. Let ( p ) be the selling price per kettle.

Therefore, there are 4 times 4 times 4 = 64 points in total in this three-dimensional grid. 2. **Line Formation**: A line in three-dimensional space can be uniquely determined if we know two distinct points through which the line passes. However, the problem specifies that the line must pass through four distinct points. This implies that these points must be collinear and equally spaced along the line. 3. **Direction Vectors**: The direction of a line can be described by a vector (a, b, c), where a, b, c are integers that describe how we move from one point to another along the line. For the points to be within the bounds of our grid (1 to 4 in each dimension), a, b, c must be chosen such that the line does not extend beyond this range when moving from one point to another. 4. **Finding Valid Vectors**: We need to find all vectors (a, b, c) such that moving from any point (i, j, k) to (i+a, j+b, k+c) stays within the grid and hits exactly four distinct points. The maximum step size for each component of the vector should be such that the fourth point (i+3a, j+3b, k+3c) is still within the grid. This restricts a, b, c to values in {-1, 0, 1} (since larger steps would exceed the grid boundary when considering four points). 5. **Counting Distinct Lines**: Each vector (a, b, c) where a, b, c in {-1, 0, 1} and not all zero, gives a potential direction for lines. However, we must ensure that the line passes through exactly four distinct points.

We need to account for this by ensuring that we do not double-count lines. 7. **Calculation**: We calculate the number of valid lines by iterating over all possible starting points and directions, ensuring that the resulting points are within the grid and adjusting for any symmetrical redundancies.

However, this equation gives k = frac{3}{2}, which is not an integer and thus, cannot be used since k must be an integer in the binomial expansion. - **Scenario 2**: When the term comes from the multiplication of ax with a term from the expansion of ({x+frac{1}{x}})^6, we set 6-2k = 2 (since multiplying by ax increases the exponent by 1). Solving 6-2k = 2 gives k = 2. 3. **Calculate the Coefficient**: - Using k = 2 from Scenario 2, we find the coefficient of the x^3 term to be a{C}_{6}^{2}. Since {C}_{6}^{2} = 15, the coefficient is 15a. 4. **Solve for a**: - Given that the coefficient of the x^3 term is 30, we set 15a = 30 and solve for a. This gives a = frac{30}{15} = 2.

The red balls must either occupy the positions 1, 3, 5, ldots, 19 (the odd positions) or the positions 2, 4, 6, ldots, 20 (the even positions). Therefore, there are two scenarios to consider: - Scenario 1: Red balls in odd positions. - Scenario 2: Red balls in even positions. 2. In each scenario, we need to arrange 5 green balls and 5 blue balls in the remaining 10 positions which alternate with the red balls. 3. The number of ways to arrange 5 green and 5 blue balls in 10 positions with equal total of either color can be calculated using the binomial coefficient: [ binom{10}{5} = frac{10!}{5! cdot 5!} = 252 ] 4. Since there are 2 scenarios (odd positions and even positions) for placing the red balls, the total number of ways for this case is: [ 2 times 252 = 504 ] Case 2: A green ball and a blue ball are adjacent to each other 1. We treat a green-blue pair as a single unit. After placing this pair, the sequence still needs to ensure no two adjacent balls are of the same color. 2. The red balls will occupy the non-adjacent positions relative to the green-blue pairs. We need to calculate the number of ways to place the green-blue pairs and then arrange the remaining green and blue balls. 3.

The remaining number of green and blue balls to be placed will each be 4 (as one pair was used): [ binom{8}{4} = frac{8!}{4! cdot 4!} = 70 ] 6.

Thus, the winning outcomes are: [ { mathrm{HHH}, mathrm{TTT} } ] There are 2 winning outcomes. 3. **Calculate the Probability of Winning:** The probability of an event is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

Let's calculate the probability of drawing a red or blue marble: Total probability = Probability of white + Probability of green + Probability of red + Probability of blue Since we want to find the combined probability of red or blue, we can group them together: Total probability = Probability of white + Probability of green + Probability of (red or blue) We know that the total probability is 1 (certainty), so: 1 = 1/4 (white) + 1/3 (green) + Probability of (red or blue) To combine the fractions, we need a common denominator, which in this case is 12: 1 = 3/12 (white) + 4/12 (green) + Probability of (red or blue) Now, we can add the fractions for white and green: 1 = 7/12 (white and green combined) + Probability of (red or blue) To find the probability of red or blue, we subtract the combined probability of white and green from 1: Probability of (red or blue) = 1 - 7/12 To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator, which we already have: Probability of (red or blue) = 12/12 - 7/12 Now, subtract the numerators: Probability of (red or blue) = (12 - 7)/12 Probability of (red or blue) = 5/12 So, the probability that the marble drawn will be either red or blue is boxed{5/12} ."},{"prompt":"A man's speed with the current is 15 km/hr and the speed of the current is 2.5 km/hr.

So, the equation representing the total number of dimes and quarters she has left is: 350 (number of dimes) + (3/5)Q (number of quarters left) = 392 (total number of dimes and quarters) Now, let's solve for Q: (3/5)Q = 392 - 350 (3/5)Q = 42 To find Q, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (3/5), which is (5/3): Q = 42 * (5/3) Q = 14 * 5 Q = 70 So, Gloria originally had 70 quarters.

These trees have a strange property: from any coniferous tree, if you take two trees skipping one tree in between, one of them is coniferous and the other is deciduous; and from any coniferous tree, if you take two trees skipping two trees in between, one of them is coniferous and the other is deciduous. How many birches are planted around the house?","completion":"1. **Understand the Problem:** The problem states that there are 96 trees planted in a circle around a house in an old estate. The trees are of three types: pines, firs, and birches. There is an important property regarding the arrangement of these trees: - From any coniferous tree (pine or fir), when you skip one tree, the tree found there must be a birch if the other skipped tree is coniferous. - Similarly, from any coniferous tree, when you skip three trees, the tree found there must also be a birch if the other skipped tree is coniferous. 2. **Simplify the Problem:** We reduce the problem by considering half of the trees due to the symmetry and cyclic nature of the arrangement: - There are 96/2 = 48 trees to consider initially. Reduce further by noting the repetitive cycle every second tree: - For half of these trees (48 trees), we have periodic properties. 3. **Examine the Pattern:** Consider one of the coniferous trees and label it as Tree 1. Assume the cycle around the tree numbering from 1 to 48. - The properties of the tree arrangement indicate that the trees adjacent to any coniferous tree (every second tree) should form repetitive patterns. 4. **Determine the Repetitive Pattern:** Start examining from Tree 1, assume it to be a coniferous tree: - Tree 2 must then be a birch. Tree 3 must be coniferous due to the same adjacent property. Tree 4 must be coniferous, and Tree 5 must be a birch, Tree 6 and Tree 7 be coniferous, repeating every third tree: - We can see a pattern forming ( text{Birch, Coniferous, Coniferous} ). 5. **Count the Birches:** Since we have the pattern ([Birch, Coniferous, Coniferous]) repeating through the 48 trees: - The cycle is repeated 48 / 3 = 16 times per array of trees. - Thus the pattern ( text{Birch, Coniferous, Coniferous} ) for each set implies that one out of every three trees is a birch. 6. **Extend to the Complete Circle:** Extending back to the full set of 96 trees: - The same pattern will apply, thus repeating twice (16 + 16 = 32).

Since the vertices of Pi_1 and Pi_2 divide the segment equally, the x-coordinate of the vertex of Pi_1, 11.5, is half the x-coordinate of the vertex of Pi_2: [ 11.5 = frac{a}{2} quad Rightarrow quad a = 2 cdot 11.5 = 23 ] 4. **Find the Second Intersection Point of Parabola Pi_2:** - Pi_2 intersects the x-axis at x=13 (given) and at another point, which we'll denote by t. - The x-coordinate of the vertex of Pi_2 is the midpoint of these two intersection points: [ frac{13 + t}{2} = 23 ] - Solving for t: [ 13 + t = 46 quad Rightarrow quad t = 46 - 13 = 33 ] Therefore, the second point where parabola Pi_2 intersects the x-axis is at x = 33.

Such an ( r ) exists by the Chinese Remainder Theorem because ( 2009 ) and ( 2010 ) are coprime. This scaling ensures that the exponent of ( p ) in ( S ) becomes divisible by ( 2009 ) while not affecting the product condition (since ( r equiv 0 pmod{2010} )). 6. **Repeat for All Primes**: Repeat the above adjustment for all primes ( p ) dividing ( S ).

This can be done by checking if the determinant of the matrix formed by their components is non-zero. The determinant is calculated as 1times 2-2times (-2) = 2 + 4 = 6 neq 0. Since the determinant is not equal to zero, overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are not collinear and hence can serve as a basis for a plane.

We note that the function y=2^{t} is always increasing for all real numbers because the base of the exponent, 2, is greater than 1. Therefore, the monotonic behavior of f(x) on the interval left(-infty ,6right) depends solely on the behavior of the exponent t=x^{2}+4ax+2. 2. **Analyzing the Exponent t:** We let t=x^{2}+4ax+2 and recognize that the monotonicity of f(x) is determined by the monotonicity of t. For f(x) to be decreasing, t must be decreasing as well, because a decreasing exponent with a base greater than 1 will result in a decreasing function. 3. **Determining the Interval of Decrease for t:** The quadratic function t=x^{2}+4ax+2 is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of x^2 is positive). This parabola is decreasing on the interval left(-infty, -2aright] because -2a is the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, and to the left of this vertex, the function decreases. 4. **Relating the Intervals:** For f(x) to be monotonically decreasing on left(-infty ,6right), it is necessary that left(-infty ,6right)subseteq left(-infty ,-2aright].

Let us define what constitutes a \\"good\\" number. A natural number is considered \\"good\\" if its decimal representation consists only of the digits 0 and 1. 2. Suppose we have two good numbers ( A ) and ( B ). Consider their product ( A cdot B ). For the product to also be a good number, each term in the expansion of this product must be a power of 10. This is because each digit in the product must be 0 or 1, and terms from the expansion should not interfere with each other. 3. Let's take specific good numbers for ( A ) and ( B ): [ A = 10^2 + 10^4 + 10^8 + cdots + 10^{1024} ] [ B = 10^{N-2} + 10^{N-4} + 10^{N-8} + cdots + 10^{N-1024} ] where ( N ) is a large even number (e.g., one million). 4. Expanding the product ( A cdot B ), we get terms of the form: [ left(10^aright) cdot left(10^{N-b}right) = 10^{a + N - b} ] 5. For the product ( A cdot B ) to result in another good number, each term ( 10^{a + N - b} ) in the expansion should be distinct. If there were any repeated terms, they would sum and potentially result in non-good numbers (values other than digits 0 and 1). 6. To ensure that ( a + N - b ) is distinct for different pairs of terms ( (a, b) ): [ a + N - b = x + N - y implies a + y = b + x ] Since ( a, b, x, ) and ( y ) are powers of 2, this equation holds only if ( a = b ) and ( x = y ). 7. If the terms are distinct, the sum of the digits of the resulting product should also adhere properly to the good number property. However, if any terms repeat, the resulting number can have combined digits violating the 0 and 1 rule, making our product not wholly good in some cases. 8. Therefore, given the nature of our specific example with powers of 10, the resulting product can, indeed, fail to maintain the sum of digits requirement as equal to the product of the sums of individual digits of the factors. When multiple terms align correctly as ( 10^N ), the addition provides us with a number whose digits' sum might not match exactly a single digit.

The masses of any two neighboring pears differ by no more than 1 gram. Prove that all the pears can be paired into identical bags and the bags can be lined up in such a way that the masses of any ...","completion":"1. **Initial Assumption:** Let's assume we have an even number of pears, and the mass difference between any two adjacent pears is at most 1 gram. 2. **Arranging the Pears:** Arrange the pears in non-decreasing order of their masses. Suppose the pears are arranged as a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n} such that a_1 leq a_2 leq ldots leq a_{2n}. 3. **Contradiction Step:** Let's assume that our claim is false, i.e., there exists at least one pair of adjacent pears such that the mass difference is more than 1 gram. Mathematically, this means there exists an index i such that a_i > a_{i-1}+1. 4. **Color Coding:** Color the pears with mass leq a as green and those with mass > a+1 as yellow. According to our assumption, there must be at least one pair of adjacent green and yellow pears: - For example, if a_{k} is green and a_{k+1} is yellow then, by our assumption, the mass difference of a_{k+1} and a_k should be more than 1. 5. **Absurdity Check:** Since our initial problem states that the mass difference between any pair of adjacent pears is at most 1 gram, this leads to a contradiction. Hence, no such pair exists. 6. **Pairing the Pears:** We can now pair the pears as follows: - Pair the first pear with the last pear, the second with the second-last, and so on. Specifically, the pairing will be (a_1, a_{2n}), (a_2, a_{2n-1}), etc. - This means each pair will be (a_i, a_{2n-i+1}) for i = 1, 2, ldots, n. 7. **Sum of Each Pair:** Check the mass of these pairs. Since the series is in non-decreasing order and adjacent pears differ by at most 1 gram: - For any i, |a_{i} - a_{i+1}| leq 1. - Thus, for pairs (a_i, a_{2n-i+1}) and (a_{i+1}, a_{2n-i}), the total mass difference would be within acceptable limits. 8. **Conclusion:** By arranging pears in pairs such that (a_i, a_{2n-i+1}), and since each pair satisfies the mass difference constraint, it is possible to arrange the pairs satisfying the required conditions.

Elmo's clone goes first, and we are interested in understanding the outcome for any given n geq 3. 1. **Base Case Analysis:** - For n = 3 or n = 4: The game is trivial because for n = 3, only one triangle is possible, and for n = 4, the game can be analyzed by simple case checks. The player making the first move always wins since they can force the game condition to indicate no further moves for the other player. 2. **Winning Strategy for General Case (n geq 5):** - We describe an inductive strategy that shows the first player (Elmo's clone) always has a winning move irrespective of n. The strategy involves picking a specific type of triangle initially and then using a copying strategy. 3. **Initial move for n geq 6:** - The choice of the first triangle is crucial. If n is even, choose an isosceles triangle with its base cutting off exactly one point on either side (left or right) of the base. If n is odd, choose an isosceles triangle whereby the base cuts off zero points. 4. **Copying Strategy:** - Once the first triangle is correctly chosen, the first player (Elmo's clone) can adopt the strategy-stealing method. The steps are: - Every time the second player makes a valid move, the first player mirrors this move relative to the setup that results in previously dismissed triangle configurations. - Copying ensures that the second player can never force an exclusive win condition onto the first player without mirroring it back. 5. **Strategy analysis:** - The stealing strategy implies that no matter what move the second player makes, the first player can always mimic it using the remaining points to force a valid counter-triangle. 6. **Conclusion:** - Because the first player can always make a valid move when it's their turn by copying the opponent's previous move, they will never be the first to run out of moves.

Consider the trapezoid (ABCD) with bases (AB) and (CD). Let the diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect at point (O). 2. Draw a line through (O) parallel to the bases (AB) and (CD). Let this line form angles (alpha) and (beta) with the diagonals (AC) and (BD), respectively. 3. For any point (P) on this line, let (d_1) and (d_2) be the distances from point (P) to the diagonals (AC) and (BD), respectively. 4. The distance from a point to a line can be expressed in terms of the distance to a parallel line and the angles formed by these lines. In this case, the distances (d_1) and (d_2) are proportional to the sines of angles (alpha) and (beta): [ d_1 propto sin alpha quad text{and} quad d_2 propto sin beta ] Hence, we have: [ frac{d_1}{d_2} = frac{sin alpha}{sin beta} ] 5.

This follows from the properties of similar triangles and the fact that the height from the base to the opposite vertex must be the same for both triangles. 2. **Application of Lemma 01**: We apply this lemma to the problem by proving the crucial claim. **Claim 01**: ( A_1 C_1 ) is a line passing through the midpoint of ( BD ) and parallel to ( AC ). **Proof**: Denote the midpoint of ( BD ) as ( M_1 ). Without loss of generality, assume ( M_1 ) lies inside ( [ACD] ). Notice that ([ABCM_1] = [AM_1CD] = frac{1}{2}[ABCD]).

The probability that event A occurs exactly 6 times in 10 trials can be calculated using the binomial formula.

The problem states that we have a regular n-gon (a polygon with n equal sides and angles), centered at O. We denote by vec{v}_1, vec{v}_2, ldots, vec{v}_n the vectors originating from O and pointing to the vertices of the polygon. These vectors are numbered sequentially. 2. We need to prove that if a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_n are some real numbers, then the vector sum a_1 vec{v}_1 + a_2 vec{v}_2 + ldots + a_n vec{v}_n is non-zero. 3. First, recall an essential property of regular polygons concerning their vertices. If we sum all the vectors from the center to the vertices, the result is the zero vector: [ vec{v}_1 + vec{v}_2 + ldots + vec{v}_n = 0. ] 4. Using the given numbers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n, we can express the vector sum as: [ a_1 vec{v}_1 + a_2 vec{v}_2 + ldots + a_n vec{v}_n. ] 5. To prove that this sum is non-zero, we transform the given expression: [ a_1 vec{v}_1 + a_2 vec{v}_2 + ldots + a_n vec{v}_n = a_1 (vec{v}_1 + vec{v}_2 + ldots + vec{v}_n) + (a_2 - a_1) vec{v}_2 + (a_3 - a_2) vec{v}_3 + ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) vec{v}_n. ] 6. Since vec{v}_1 + vec{v}_2 + ldots + vec{v}_n = 0, the term a_1 (vec{v}_1 + vec{v}_2 + ldots + vec{v}_n) equals zero, simplifying the equation: [ 0 + (a_2 - a_1) vec{v}_2 + (a_3 - a_2) vec{v}_3 + ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) vec{v}_n. ] 7. Note that all coefficients (a_2 - a_1), (a_3 - a_2), ldots, (a_n - a_{n-1}) are positive because a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_n. 8. Each term can be written as: [ c_2 vec{v}_2 + c_3 vec{v}_3 + ldots + c_n vec{v}_n, ] where c_i = a_i - a_{i-1} for i = 2, 3, ldots, n are positive constants. 9. Given that the vectors vec{v}_2, vec{v}_3, ldots, vec{v}_n are distinct and directionally equally spaced around the center O, the linear combination of these vectors with positive coefficients cannot sum to the zero vector. This argument holds because the vectors point to different directions and the magnitudes (positive coefficients) do not allow Full symmetry which would result in zero summation. 10. Therefore, the resultant vector: [ (a_2 - a_1) vec{v}_2 + (a_3 - a_2) vec{v}_3 + ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) vec{v}_n ] is non-zero. # Conclusion: The vector sum a_1 vec{v}_1 + a_2 vec{v}_2 + ldots + a_n vec{v}_n is non-zero. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Simplify the expression dfrac{1 + sin x}{cos x} cdot dfrac{sin 2x}{2 cos^2left(dfrac{pi}{4} dfrac{x}{2}right)}.","completion":"First, we apply the trigonometric identities sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x and cosleft(dfrac{pi}{2} - xright) = sin x to rewrite the expression as dfrac{1 + sin x}{cos x} cdot dfrac{2 sin x cos x}{2 cos^2left(dfrac{pi}{4} - dfrac{x}{2}right)} = dfrac{1 + sin x}{cos x} cdot dfrac{2 sin x cos x}{1 + sin x}.

In the world of paper folding, there is a saying cannot fold more than 8 times. To verify this saying, someone conducted an experiment using a square paper with a side length of 4 kilometers, folded it up to 13 times at most. Let the thickness of the paper after the first fold be a_{1}, after the second fold be a_{2}, and so on.

This means if the thickness of the paper is a millimeters initially, after the first fold, the thickness becomes 2a millimeters. 2. **Defining the Sequence**: We can define a sequence {a_{n}} where a_{n} represents the thickness of the paper after n folds. According to the folding process, we have a_{1} = 2a (after the first fold). 3. **Identifying the Pattern**: Since each fold doubles the thickness of the paper, we have a_{n+1} = 2a_{n}. This relationship shows that the sequence of thicknesses forms a geometric sequence with the first term a_{1} = 2a and a common ratio of 2. 4. **Calculating the Thickness After 13 Folds**: To find the thickness after 13 folds, we use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, a_{n} = a_{1} times r^{(n-1)}, where a_{1} is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number. Substituting a_{1} = 2a, r = 2, and n = 13, we get: [ a_{13} = 2a times 2^{(13-1)} = 2a times 2^{12} = 2^{13}a ] Therefore, the thickness of the paper after 13 folds is 2^{13}a millimeters.

This means that if the bus were moving for a full hour without stopping, it would cover 60 km. However, since the bus is only moving for 3/4 of an hour, we need to calculate the distance it would cover in that time at the speed of 60 km/hr. Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 60 km/hr × (3/4) hr Distance = 60 × 0.75 Distance = 45 km So, the bus covers 45 km in the 3/4 hour it is moving.

If both pipes are applied to fill the pool, how many hours will it take?","completion":"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of rates. Let's denote the rate at which the first pipe fills the pool as R1 and the rate at which the second pipe fills the pool as R2. The first pipe fills the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is: R1 = 1 pool / 8 hours The second pipe fills the pool in 12 hours, so its rate is: R2 = 1 pool / 12 hours When both pipes are working together, their rates add up. So the combined rate, R_combined, is: R_combined = R1 + R2 Substituting the values we have: R_combined = (1 pool / 8 hours) + (1 pool / 12 hours) To add these rates, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 12 is 24, so we convert the rates to have the same denominator: R_combined = (3 pools / 24 hours) + (2 pools / 24 hours) Now we can add the rates: R_combined = (3 pools + 2 pools) / 24 hours R_combined = 5 pools / 24 hours This means that together, the pipes can fill 5 pools in 24 hours. But we are interested in filling just one pool, so we need to find out how long it takes to fill 1 pool with this combined rate. We can set up a proportion: (5 pools / 24 hours) = (1 pool / x hours) To solve for x, we cross-multiply: 5 pools * x hours = 1 pool * 24 hours 5x = 24 Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for x: x = 24 / 5 x = 4.8 hours So, it will take boxed{4.8} hours for both pipes to fill the pool when working together."},{"prompt":"Catherine has 18 bottle caps and 19 blocks.

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that ( f(x) ) is reducible.

Therefore, for each ( i ), we have: [ g(a_i) + h(a_i) = 0. ] 4. **Polynomial Root Implications**: Since ( g(a_i) + h(a_i) = 0 ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ) and all ( a_i ) are distinct, the polynomial ( g(x) + h(x) ) has ( n ) distinct roots. 5. **Degree Comparison**: However, ( deg(g + h) leq max(deg(g), deg(h)) ). Since both ( deg(g) < n ) and ( deg(h) < n ), we have ( deg(g + h) < n ). 6. **Contradiction Through Degree**: A polynomial with degree less than ( n ) cannot have ( n ) distinct roots. This contradiction shows that our initial assumption – that ( f(x) ) can be factored into polynomials of lower degree in ( mathbf{Z}[x] ) – must be false. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, ( f(x) ) is irreducible in ( mathbf{Z}[x] ).
