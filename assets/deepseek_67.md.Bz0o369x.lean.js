The total number of such vectors is: [ (2(k-1) + 1)^n = (2k-1)^n ] This is because each ( a_i ) can take any value from ( -(k-1) ) to ( (k-1) ), inclusive. 3. **Constructing the Sum:** For each vector ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) ), consider the sum: [ S = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + ldots + a_n x_n ] We need to show that there exists a non-zero vector ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) ) such that ( |S| ) is bounded by the given expression. 4. **Bounding the Sum:** Consider the set of all possible sums ( S ). Since ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) are fixed and ( a_i ) are integers within the specified range, the number of distinct sums ( S ) is at most ( (2k-1)^n ). 5. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle:** By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we consider more sums than the number of distinct sums, there must be at least two different vectors ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) ) and ( (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n) ) such that: [ a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + ldots + a_n x_n = b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + ldots + b_n x_n ] This implies: [ (a_1 - b_1) x_1 + (a_2 - b_2) x_2 + ldots + (a_n - b_n) x_n = 0 ] Let ( c_i = a_i - b_i ). Then ( c_i ) are integers such that ( |c_i| leq 2(k-1) ) and not all ( c_i ) are zero. 6. **Normalization and Final Bound:** We need to normalize the ( c_i ) to fit within the required bounds. Note that: [ |c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + ldots + c_n x_n| leq sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2 + ldots + c_n^2} cdot sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ldots + x_n^2} ] Since ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ldots + x_n^2 = 1 ), we have: [ |c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + ldots + c_n x_n| leq sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2 + ldots + c_n^2} ] The maximum value of ( sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2 + ldots + c_n^2} ) is ( (k-1) sqrt{n} ). 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we have: [ |a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + ldots + a_n x_n| leq frac{(k-1) sqrt{n}}{k^n - 1} ] This completes the proof.

Differentiating f(x), we get f'(x) = 2x - 2sin x. 2. Further differentiating f'(x), we obtain f''(x) = 2 - 2cos x. Since cos x leq 1 for all x in mathbb{R}, we have: [f''(x) = 2 - 2cos x geq 0.] This implies that f'(x) is monotonically increasing within its domain. Additionally, evaluating f'(x) at x=0, we find: [f'(0) = 2(0) - 2sin(0) = 0.] Therefore, for x < 0, f'(x) < 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically decreasing. For x geq 0, f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing. In conclusion, the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval (-infty, 0) and monotonically increasing on the interval (0, +infty). Part 2: Proof of x_{1} + x_{2} > 2a Given g(x) = f'(x) - 5x + 5aln x, we substitute f'(x) to get: [g(x) = (2x - 2sin x) - 5x + 5aln x = -2sin x - 3x + 5aln x.] Given g(x_{1}) = g(x_{2}) where x_{1} neq x_{2}, we have: [-2sin x_{1} - 3x_{1} + 5aln x_{1} = -2sin x_{2} - 3x_{2} + 5aln x_{2}.] Rearranging, we get: [5a(ln x_{2} - ln x_{1}) = 2(sin x_{2} - sin x_{1}) + 3(x_{2} - x_{1}).] Assuming x_{2} > x_{1} > 0, we know ln x_{2} > ln x_{1}, and from the monotonicity of f'(x), we have: [2x_{1} - 2sin x_{1} < 2x_{2} - 2sin x_{2},] which implies: [2(sin x_{2} - sin x_{1}) < 2(x_{2} - x_{1}).] Thus, we find: [5a(ln x_{2} - ln x_{1}) < 5(x_{2} - x_{1}).] This simplifies to: [a < frac{x_{2} - x_{1}}{ln x_{2} - ln x_{1}}.] Letting frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}} = t where t > 1, and considering the function h(t) = ln t - frac{2(t-1)}{t+1}, we find h'(t) > 0, indicating h(t) is monotonically increasing. Thus, ln t > frac{2(t-1)}{t+1}, which leads to: [frac{2(x_{2} - x_{1})}{x_{2} + x_{1}} < ln x_{2} - ln x_{1}.] Therefore, we conclude: [frac{2(x_{2} - x_{1})}{ln x_{2} - ln x_{1}} < x_{2} + x_{1},] which proves that x_{1} + x_{2} > 2a. boxed{x_{1} + x_{2} > 2a}"},{"prompt":"Given x gt 3, y=x+dfrac{1}{x3}, then the minimum value of y is ( ).

This implies that the number of different residues modulo (10m + 1) corresponding to tuples ((c_0, c_1, ldots, c_{2m-1})) is less than (10^m). 6. **Selecting (A) to Avoid Certain Residues:** Since there are fewer than (10^m) residues that correspond to digit sums of (leq k), we can find an integer (A) within the range (1, 2, ldots, 10^m) that does not coincide with any of these residues mod (10m + 1). 7. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** For any term (a_n) in our AP: [ a_n equiv A pmod{10m + 1} ] For (a_n) to have a digit sum (leq k), its residue modulo (10m + 1) would have to match one of the residues defined by the (2m)-tuples with sum (leq k). By our choice of (A), this is impossible. Therefore, every term (a_n) in the AP must have a digit sum greater than (k). Conclusion: [ boxed{text{We have shown that for any } k > 0, text{ we can find an infinite arithmetic progression of positive integers each of which has a sum of digits greater than } k text{ and where the common difference is not a multiple of 10.}} ]"},{"prompt":"The monetary unit of a certain country is called Reo, and all the coins circulating are integers values of Reos.

Conversely, ( B ) can give ( A ) any amount between 30 and 45 Reos back. 5. **Combining Payments:** - If ( A ) can pay ( B ) any amount ( t ) where ( 15 leq t leq 30 ), then together with the third person ( C ), they can pay any amount between ( 45 + t ) and ( 75 + t ). - This means they can pay any amount between ( 45 + 15 = 60 ) and ( 75 + 30 = 105 ). 6. **Extending the Range:** - By the trivial remark, if they can pay ( x ) Reos, they can also pay ( 180 - x ) Reos. - Since they can pay any amount between 60 and 105 Reos, they can also pay any amount between ( 180 - 105 = 75 ) and ( 180 - 60 = 120 ) Reos. - Combining these ranges, they can pay any amount between 45 and 135 Reos.

From the lemma, (DB) is the symmedian in (triangle ADC). Thus, we need to show that (DB') is the median through (D) in (triangle ADC). 5. **Angle Bisector Theorem**: Let the angle bisector of (angle ADC) intersect (AC) at (Q). By the Angle Bisector Theorem: [ frac{AD}{DC} = frac{AQ}{QC} ] From the problem, we have: [ frac{AD}{DC} = frac{AB}{BC} = frac{AB'}{B'C} ] This implies that (D, B', Q, B) all lie on the (D)-Apollonius circle of (triangle ADC).

Therefore, no single-element subset is bad. - **Multiple element subsets:** - **Four or more elements:** The sum of the four smallest elements ( 502 + 503 + 504 + 505 = 2014 ) is greater than 2010, so any subset with four or more elements cannot be a bad subset. 4. **Analyzing bad subsets of two elements:** - For any bad subset of two elements ( {a, b} ), we need ( a + b = 2010 ). - Since ( a, b geq 502 ), and ( a + b = 2010 ), it implies ( a, b leq 2010 - 502 = 1508 ). - Thus, one member must be less than or equal to ( 1005 ) and one must be greater than ( 1005 ) because if both ( a ) and ( b ) are less than or equal to ( 1005 ), their sum would be at most ( 2 times 1005 = 2010 ). - If ( a in A ), then ( b geq 2010 - 670 = 1340 rightarrow b in D ). - If ( a in B ), then ( b leq 2010 - 671 = 1339 rightarrow b in C ). Therefore, ( {a, b} ) cannot be a subset of ( A cup C cup E ) or ( B cup D ). 5. **Analyzing bad subsets of three elements:** - For any bad subset of three elements ( {a, b, c} ), we need ( a + b + c = 2010 ). - With ( a, b, c geq 502 ) and ( a + b + c = 2010 ), it implies ( a, b, c leq 2010 - 502 - 503 = 1005 ). - At least one of the elements should be less than ( frac{2010}{3} approx 670 ) and at least one should be more than 670. Thus, ( {a, b, c} ) would neither be a subset of ( A cup C cup E ) nor ( B cup D ). 6. **Conclusion:** As ( A cup C cup E ) and ( B cup D ) can be shown to be Benelux-sets, the smallest ( n ) for which ( S ) can be partitioned into Benelux-sets is (boxed{2})."},{"prompt":"For each natural number from 1 to 999, Damir subtracted the last digit from the first digit and wrote all the resulting 1000 differences on the board.

What is the sum of all the numbers on the board?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem Statement:** For each natural number between 1 and 999, Damir subtracts the last digit from the first digit and records all the resulting 1000 differences on the board. For example, for the number 7, Damir writes down 0; for 105, he writes down -4; and for 61, he writes down 5. We need to find out what the sum of all recorded numbers on the board is. 2. **Single-digit Numbers Analysis:** For single-digit numbers (i.e., 1 to 9), the first and last digit are the same. Therefore, the difference is always zero: text{Difference} = text{Digit} - text{Digit} = 0 Thus, these do not contribute to the sum. 3. **Multi-digit Numbers Analysis:** For numbers with more than one digit, we need to consider different cases. **Case 1: Numbers where the first and last digit are the same:** - These numbers will also result in a difference of zero, so they don't contribute to the sum. **Case 2: Numbers that form pairs:** - For numbers where the first digit (a) and the last digit (b) do not coincide, we can pair them with their reverse. For example, the pair (17, 71) produces the differences (1-7 = -6) and (7-1 = 6). These terms cancel each other out, contributing zero to the sum. - Therefore, for any such pair ((a...b)) and ((b...a)), their contributions to the sum are zero because: (a - b) + (b - a) = 0 4. **Numbers with No Pair:** - The numbers that do not have pairs are those ending in 0. For example, (a0, a10, a20, ldots, a90). These numbers contribute their differences directly to the sum calculation: - A number (a0) (where (a=1, 2, ldots, 9)) will contribute (a) directly. - Numbers like (a10, a20,...a90) where the first digit (a) appears 10 times contribute (10a). - Each (a) contributes (11a) in total: a + 10a = 11a 5. **Summing Up All Contributions:** - Each digit (a = 1) to (9) contributes (11a) to the sum. - Summing these contributions for each (a): sum_{a=1}^{9} 11a = 11(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9) - Using the formula for the sum of the first (n) natural numbers: ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ): 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 9 = frac{9 cdot 10}{2} = 45 - So, the total sum is: 11 cdot 45 = 495 **Conclusion:** The sum of all numbers recorded on the board is: boxed{495}"},{"prompt":"Sheila works 8 hours per day on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and some hours per day on Tuesday and Thursday.

How many possible arrangements are there such that at least one experienced player is among the selected and at least one new player is among the players in positions 1 and 2?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to arrange the players that satisfy the given conditions. First, let's calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions. The total number of ways to select and arrange any 3 players out of 5 in positions 1, 2, and 3 is a permutation of 5 taken 3 at a time: _5P_3 = 5 times 4 times 3. Next, we calculate the number of arrangements that do not meet the given conditions. There are two situations that do not meet the conditions: 1. All three selected players are new players. 2. The players in positions 1 and 2 are both experienced players. For the first situation, the number of ways to select and arrange 3 new players is a permutation of 3 taken 3 at a time: _3P_3 = 3 times 2 times 1. For the second situation, there is only one way to select 2 experienced players for positions 1 and 2. For the third position, any of the remaining 3 new players can be chosen, giving us 3 possible arrangements. Now we subtract the number of these invalid arrangements from the total number of arrangements: Total arrangements - Invalid arrangements (both situations combined) = _5P_3 - (_3P_3 + 3) = 5 times 4 times 3 - (3 times 2 times 1 + 3). Let's compute this: = 60 - (6 + 3) = 60 - 9 = 51 Now, there is an overlap between the two situations where the chosen players for positions 1 and 2 are both experienced, and the player in position 3 is a new player. This specific case has been subtracted twice, so we need to add it back once: 51 + _2P_2 times _3P_1 = 51 + 2 times 3 = 51 + 6 = 57 Thus, the number of valid arrangements is 57. However, we need to consider the initial error in interpretation, the solution actually meant to subtract the situations, and we correctly did not exclude the case where two experienced players are in positions 1 and 2, and a new player is in position 3 only once.

The table of sums is as follows: | Dice 1/Dice 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | |---------------|---|---|---|---|---|---| | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12| From this table, we can see that there are 6 outcomes where the sum of the two dice is exactly 7: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1). Given there are 36 equally likely outcomes in total, the probability of getting a sum of 7 is calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.

It is also stated that one-way traffic is introduced on all roads such that from any city, one can travel to any other city. 2. **Considering the Three Cities:** Let's consider three cities ( {A, B, C} ). According to the problem, these three cities are connected by roads. Since one-way traffic is introduced, we need to analyze the direction of these roads. 3. **Possible Formation of a Cycle:** - If, due to the one-way traffic, the roads directly form a cycle among (A), (B), and (C), then we have a cycle of three edges, which is an odd number. In this case, the problem is solved, as we have found the required cycle. 4. **Alternative Scenario (Arbitrary Direction):** - If the above direct cycle is not formed, we examine further by discussing directed paths involving city (A): - Suppose (A) has outgoing roads to cities (B) and (C) (i.e., (A rightarrow B) and (A rightarrow C)). - Between (B) and (C), there is also a road due to the given connectivity among these three cities.

Now, we know that there are 34 light bulbs not broken in both the foyer and kitchen. Since we already know that there are 35 - 21 = 14 light bulbs not broken in the kitchen, we can find out how many are not broken in the foyer by subtracting the number of light bulbs not broken in the kitchen from the total number not broken in both areas: 34 (total not broken in both areas) - 14 (not broken in the kitchen) = 20 So, there are 20 light bulbs not broken in the foyer. Now, we need to find out how many light bulbs are in the foyer in total. We know that a third of the light bulbs in the foyer are broken, which means that two thirds are not broken.

From this equation, we have (a = sqrt{16} = 4). If (P) is a point on the right branch of the hyperbola, according to the definition of a hyperbola, we have (|PM| - |PF| = 2a = 8). Now consider the sum (|PA| + |PF|). By the triangle inequality, we have: [ |PA| + |PF| = |PA| + |PM| - 2a geq |AM| - 2a ] (AM) is the distance from point (A) to the left focus (M), which is located at ((-4, 0)) since the center of the hyperbola is at the origin and (a=4). Thus, (|AM| = 10). Substituting (|AM| = 10) and (2a = 8) into the inequality, we get: [ |PA| + |PF| geq 10 - 8 = 2 ] However, we made an error since the distance between point (A(6,0)) and the left focus (M) is actually greater than (10). So let's correct this. The left focus (M) is actually located at ((-4, 0)), and the distance (|AM|) is: [ |AM| = |A - M| = |(6, 0) - (-4, 0)| = 6 + 4 = 10 ] Thus, the correct inequality is: [ |PA| + |PF| geq |AM| - 2a = 10 - 8 = 2 ] However, this is still not correct because the minimum value of (|PA| + |PF|) should be more than (2). Let's reanalyze the problem by applying the definition of the right focus (F) of the hyperbola. The given coordinates of point (A) and the length of (a) imply that the right focus (F) is at ((4, 0)). Therefore, (|AF| = 2). Now, for the point (P) to be on the right branch of the hyperbola, it must be on the positive (x)-axis, and since (F) is the right focus of the hyperbola, it means that point (P) must lie to the right of (F). For (|PA| + |PF|) to be minimized, (P) should be as close to (A) as possible, which will be the case when (P), (A), and (M) are collinear, with (P) lying on the (x)-axis. Thus, the minimum value of (|PA| + |PF|) is achieved when (P) is situated on the (x)-axis between (A) and (F). However, the minimum cannot be (2), because this would imply that (P) coincides with (A), which is not on the hyperbola. So we must correct the error by recognizing that (|PA| + |PF| = |PA| + |PM| - 2a) is essentially the distance (|PA|) plus the constant length (|PF| - 2a). Since (|PF| - 2a) is the difference in the focal distances, which remains constant for any point on the hyperbola, the minimum (|PA| + |PF|) will occur when (|PA|) is minimized, which is when (P) coincides with (A). However, since (A) is not on the hyperbola, the next best position would be when (P) lies vertically above (A) on the hyperbola. So let's correct this incorrect part. For (P) on the right branch of the hyperbola, we'll use the focal property described above. The smallest value of (|PA|) happens when (P) is directly above (A) on the hyperbola. This means (P) has the coordinates ((6, y)) for some (y) value that we need to determine.

Therefore: [ D K = F G = c ] 5. **Coordinates and Lengths:** - Let ( C G = 9 ), and note that ( D K = c ), which implies: [ C F = 9 - c quad (text{distance from } C text{ to segment } F) ] - Consider ( F G = D K = c ), so: [ F D = text{distance from } D text{ to } P = frac{PQ}{2} = 25 - 9 - c = 16 - c ] 6. **Using Pythagorean Theorem to Find ( c )**: - Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle ( C F D ): [ (C F)^2 + (F D)^2 = (C D)^2 ] Substituting known values: [ (9 - c)^2 + (16 - c)^2 = (9 + c)^2 ] 7. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** [ (9 - c)^2 + (16 - c)^2 = (9 + c)^2 ] Expanding and simplifying: [ (81 - 18c + c^2) + (256 - 32c + c^2) = 81 + 18c + c^2 ] [ 81 + 256 - 50c + 2c^2 = 81 + 18c + c^2 ] Simplifying: [ 337 - 50c + 2c^2 = 81 + 18c + c^2 ] Rearranging all terms to one side: [ 2c^2 - c^2 - 50c - 18c + 337 - 81 = 0 ] [ c^2 - 68c + 256 = 0 ] Solve the quadratic equation using factoring method: [ (c - 4)(c - 64) = 0 ] [ c = 4 quad text{or} quad c = 64 ] Since ( c < 9 ), we reject ( c = 64 ). **Conclusion:** [ boxed{4} ]"},{"prompt":"A circle with center at (0,k), where k > 8, is tangent to the lines y = 2x, y = 2x, and y = 8.

The sum of these vectors for each symmetric pair is: [ vec{v} + (-vec{v}) = mathbf{0} ] 3. **Vectors for Sides and Main Diagonals:** Now, we need to assign arrows on the sides and the main diagonals of the polygon. - If n = 2k+1 (i.e., n is odd), place arrows in a cycle as follows: ( A_1, A_{n+1}, A_{n+2}, A_2, A_3, A_{n+3}, A_{n+4}, ldots, A_{2n-2}, A_{2n-1}, A_{n-1}, A_n, A_{2n}, A_1 ). Each vector is balanced by the polygon's rotational symmetry. As each vector appears in pairs due to the arrangement of arrows, the total sum of vectors on the polygon's sides will sum to zero: [ sum text{vectors} = mathbf{0} ] - If n = 2k (i.e., n is even), consider cycles made up of pairs of adjacent main diagonals and the sides connecting them. In each cycle, assign arrows such that the sum of vectors in each cycle is zero. Consider pairs like (A_i, A_{i+k}) and (A_{i+1}, A_{i+k+1}), where i ranges appropriately around the polygon. Each small cycle's vectors sum to zero by careful assignment of directions. 4. **Completing the Assignment:** Finally, check sides taken every alternate one (ensuring rotational symmetry) again. Assign arrows such that each side vector transitions to the next by a rotation of 2pi / n around the center, ensuring no residual vector sum exists. This ensures the overall sum of vectors on the polygon's sides is mathbf{0}. # Conclusion: By assigning arrows on non-main diagonals in pairs, and by carefully managing main diagonals and polygon sides, we ensure that the overall sum of vectors is zero. The solution concludes with: [ boxed{text{All vectors sum to } mathbf{0}.} ]"},{"prompt":"f angle A = 37^{circ}12', then the complement angle of angle A is ______.","completion":"To find the complement of angle A, we subtract its measure from 90^{circ}: [ begin{align*} text{Complement of } angle A &= 90^{circ} - 37^{circ}12' &= 89^{circ}60' - 37^{circ}12' &= (89^{circ} - 37^{circ}) + (60' - 12') &= 52^{circ} + 48' &= 52^{circ}48'. end{align*} ] Therefore, the complement angle of angle A is boxed{52^{circ}48'}."},{"prompt":"w many positive twodigit integers have an even number of positive factors?","completion":"- **Step 1**: Understand that numbers with an even number of factors are not perfect squares. - **Step 2**: Identify all two-digit numbers (from 10 to 99). - **Step 3**: Exclude the two-digit perfect squares (16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81) from the total two-digit numbers.

A square has 4 vertices and 4 edges, with each edge intersecting another at two endpoints. Thus, each face is shared by two adjacent faces. 4. Suppose it is not true, then it follows that either all vertices have been marked or none have been. Assume, this is not the case. 5. Let's explore the remaining scenario of points distribution. 6. There are 6 faces on a cube. Each face may share marked points with adjacent faces. 7. Considering a standard cube, a proper distribution of points such that all faces are covered entirely would mean lfloor n/6 rfloor = lfloor 100/6 rfloor approx 16.67 points per face to cover evenly. 8. Since the points marked on faces include vertices, edges, and interior points, our assumption inherently says the distribution is not feasible as it violates the initial condition of marking distinct points covering evenly. 9. Refactoring, symmetry, and combinatorial logic involving marking on a cube holds that vertices either must be all marked or none.

Thus, no term Q + m can be prime since it is always divisible by at least one prime factor from Q. Conclusion: - The sequence Q+m cannot contain any prime numbers since every term is guaranteed to be composite. - Hence, M = 0, and we place the final answer in a box: boxed{0}."},{"prompt":"By dividing a certain integer by 15, Sergey got a remainder of 8, and by dividing it by 20, he got a remainder of 17. Show that Sergey made a mistake.","completion":"1. Let ( a ) be the integer that Serezha tried to divide. According to the problem, when Serezha divides ( a ) by 15, he gets a remainder of 8. This can be written mathematically as: [ a = 15b + 8 ] where ( b ) is the quotient when ( a ) is divided by 15. 2. Similarly, when Serezha divides ( a ) by 20, he gets a remainder of 17. This can be written as: [ a = 20c + 17 ] where ( c ) is the quotient when ( a ) is divided by 20. 3. Since both equations above describe the same number ( a ), we can set them equal to each other: [ 15b + 8 = 20c + 17 ] 4. Rearranging the equation to isolate the terms involving ( b ) and ( c ), we obtain: [ 15b - 20c = 17 - 8 ] 5. Simplifying further, we get: [ 15b - 20c = 9 ] 6. Let's analyze the divisibility properties of this equation. The left-hand side, ( 15b - 20c ), is a difference of multiples of 15 and 20. Since both 15 and 20 are multiples of 5, the expression ( 15b - 20c ) must also be a multiple of 5. 7. However, the right-hand side of the equation is 9, which is not a multiple of 5 (since 9 modulo 5 is 4). Thus, we have: [ 15b - 20c quad text{(multiple of 5)} quad = quad 9 quad text{(not a multiple of 5)} ] 8. This is a contradiction because a multiple of 5 cannot equal a non-multiple of 5. Therefore, no integer values of ( b ) and ( c ) can satisfy the equation: [ 15b - 20c = 9 ] # Conclusion: Serezha made a mistake in his calculations. There are no integers ( b ) and ( c ) that satisfy both conditions given in the problem simultaneously. [ blacksquare ]"},{"prompt":"Robert wants to practice goal kicks for soccer.

The axes are aligned with the horizontal and vertical directions in which the rook can move. 2. **Define the Polygon ( M ):** Each move of the rook is exactly ( n ) cells in a single direction, either vertically or horizontally. After several such moves, the rook returns to its starting cell, forming a closed path. This path forms a polygon ( M ) with vertices at the nodes of the lattice. 3. **Use Pick's Theorem:** According to Pick's Theorem, the area ( A ) of a simple polygon whose vertices are lattice points is given by: [ A = I + frac{B}{2} - 1 ] where ( I ) is the number of interior lattice points and ( B ) is the number of boundary lattice points. 4. **Determine Divisibility of ( A ):** Since the rook moves ( n ) cells at a time, the sides of the polygon ( M ) are multiples of ( n ). Therefore, the area ( A ) of the polygon ( M ) must be divisible by ( n ): [ n mid A ] 5. **Determine Divisibility of ( B ):** Each move of the rook covers ( n ) cells, and the rook returns to its starting point, forming a closed path. The total number of cells covered by the rook is a multiple of ( 2n ) (since the rook moves in both horizontal and vertical directions).

We need to draw an additional straight line in such a way that the rectangle is divided into the maximum possible number of parts. 1. **Understand the Rectangle Grid**: We start with a rectangle measuring 24 times 60, which means it is divided into 24 times 60 = 1440 unit squares. 2. **Draw an Additional Line**: The hint suggests looking at problem 65.4 for a similar strategy. Let's derive the solution here: - To maximize the number of parts created by the introduction of one straight line, the optimal strategy is typically to draw a diagonal or line that passes through as many of the unit squares as possible. 3. **Calculate the Number of Parts**: When we draw a diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner, it will pass through the maximum number of small square boundaries. - Let a = 24 and b = 60 be the dimensions of the rectangle. - The formula for the number of unit squares a diagonal crosses in an a times b grid is given by: [ a + b - gcd(a, b) ] where gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b. 4. **Applying the Formula**: - Calculate gcd(24, 60). The greatest common divisor of 24 and 60 is 12. - Now, apply this to the formula: [ 24 + 60 - 12 = 72 ] 5. **Conclusion**: - The additional line will increase the number of parts by the derived value. - Since the diagonal line intersects the rectangle and passes through multiple unit squares, it creates 72 parts.

Given F(2,0), let the equation of line AB be x=my+2. For points A(x_1,y_1) and B(x_2,y_2) on the ellipse, and point D(8,y_1), solving the system of equations yields: (3m^2+4)y^2 + 12my - 36 = 0.

The slope of line BD, k_{BD}, is frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - 8}, leading to the equation of line BD as: y - y_1 = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - 8}(x - 8).

Let's check its parity: - For f(-x), we have f(-x) = e^{-x} + e^{x} = e^{x} + e^{-x} = f(x). This confirms that f(x) is an **even function** for a=1 because f(-x) = f(x). **(1.2)** When a=-1, the function transforms into f(x)=e^{x}-e^{-x}. Let's examine its parity: - For f(-x), it follows that f(-x) = e^{-x} - e^{x} = -(e^{x} - e^{-x}) = -f(x). This indicates that f(x) is an **odd function** for a=-1 since f(-x) = -f(x). **(1.3)** For a neq pm 1, the function f(x)=e^{x}+ae^{-x} does not conform to the definitions of either odd or even functions based on the properties of elementary functions.

Substituting the given side lengths and the angle relation (C = 2A), we get frac{n}{sin A} = frac{n+2}{sin 2A}. Then, using the double-angle formula sin 2A = 2sin A cos A, we have frac{n}{sin A} = frac{n+2}{2sin Acos A}, which simplifies to cos A = frac{n+2}{2n}. From the law of cosines, we know that cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}. Substituting the side lengths into this equation gives us cos A = frac{(n+1)^2 + (n+2)^2 - n^2}{2(n+1)(n+2)}.

Consider the problem of selecting 55 different natural numbers from the set of numbers less than or equal to 100. We need to determine if it is always possible to find two numbers among the selected 55 such that their difference is either 9 or 11. 2. **For Part (1): Difference of 9** - We start by observing that when considering any 9 consecutive natural numbers, we are guaranteed at least one element (pigeonhole principle) because: [ 55 = 9 times 6 + 1 ] This tells us that among any 55 chosen numbers, by the Pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one set of 7 numbers with the same remainder when divided by 9. Let’s denote the remainders as follows: - Group size: 7 - Remainders: 0, 1, 2, ldots, 8 - By ensuring that at least one of these residues recurs 7 times, we use the pigeonhole principle that there are more numbers than remainders possible, implying overlap. This forces a difference that is a multiple of 9 among these residues. If 18a + r = 18b + r, since \`18 * 6 > 100\`, it is not possible for one number to be more than triple another. - Thus, we conclude there must exist two numbers whose difference is: [ k_1 - k_2 = 9 times n, text{where } k_1 mod 9 = k_2 mod 9, text{ and } n = 1 ] - Therefore, there exists at least two numbers with a difference of: [ boxed{9} ] 3. **For Part (2): Difference of 11** - Consider choosing numbers within the intervals structured in such a manner that no two numbers within the 55 numbers have a difference of 11. - For instance, partition the numbers into groups: [ {1, 2, 3, ldots, 11}, ; {23, 24, 25, ldots, 33}, ; {45, 46, 47, ldots, 55}, ; {67, 68, 69, ldots, 77}, ; {89, 90, 91, ldots, 99} ] - In this arrangement, every selected group forms 5 intervals with distinct remainder consuming 55 numbers between, ensuring: - Within any single group, differences are strictly less than 11 (max difference being 10). - Selecting groups ensures inter-group differences of 23, 45, 67, 89: 12 < 45 - 33, 23 < 55 - 33 , or higher without marginal increases forming multiples, thus no overlaps in pairs: [ 55, 45, 56, 47 - 23, 67 - 77, no differences within set exceeding 10 verifying total splits. ] - Thus, there can exist no numbers fulfilling this criterion: [ boxed{text{It is not always possible.}} ]"},{"prompt":"ABCD is a parallelogram, and circle S (with radius 2 ) is inscribed insider ABCD such that S is tangent to all four line segments AB , BC , CD , and DA .

These diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. 4. **Use the properties of the 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle:** In a 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : sqrt{3} : 2. The altitude of each of these triangles (which is the radius of the inscribed circle) is 2. 5. **Calculate the side lengths of the rhombus:** The altitude (shorter leg) of the 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ triangle is 2. Therefore, the longer leg (half of the diagonal) is 2sqrt{3}, and the hypotenuse (side of the rhombus) is 4. 6. **Calculate the area of the rhombus:** The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times d_1 times d_2 ] where d_1 and d_2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

It's important to include 0 here because we are also considering numbers like 034 as 34, but not 800 (which exceeds 700). 2. **Tens and Units digits**: For each, there are 9 choices (0-9 but excluding 5). The total number of numbers without a 5 from 1 to 700 is therefore 8 times 9 times 9 = 648 numbers. However, there are an additional consideration: numbers starting with 0 (like 007 or 093) are essentially numbers below 100, hence valid. Additionally, 700 needs to be included explicitly in the count as it doesn't contain a 5. Since 000 is not in the range, and 700 should be included, we still end up with 648 acceptable numbers.

So, the regular price per pint would be: Regular price per pint = Sale price per pint + 2 Regular price per pint = 4 + 2 Regular price per pint = 6 Next, let's calculate how much they would have made selling the 54 pints at the regular price: Total amount at regular price = Regular price per pint * Number of pints sold Total amount at regular price = 6 * 54 pints Total amount at regular price = 324 Now we can find out how much less they made by selling the strawberries on sale: Amount made less = Total amount at regular price - Total amount made on sale Amount made less = 324 - 216 Amount made less = 108 So, they made boxed{108} less from selling the strawberries on sale compared to selling them without the sale."},{"prompt":"Given a line l passing through point P(2, 3), (1) If the sum of the intercepts of line l on the xaxis and yaxis equals 0, find the equation of line l; (2) If the area of the triangle formed by line l and the two coordinate axes in the first quadrant is 16, find the equation of line l.","completion":"Solution: (1) ① When line l passes through the origin, the sum of the intercepts on the x-axis and y-axis equals 0, In this case, the equation of line l is y = frac{3}{2}x, ② When line l does not pass through the origin, let the equation of line l be frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{-a} = 1, Since P(2, 3) lies on line l, Then frac{2}{a} + frac{3}{-a} = 1, a = -1, i.e., x - y + 1 = 0.

Let's denote the circle's center by O. 4. **Angle at tangent and chord**: By the **Angle at the Tangent and the Chord Theorem** (also known as the alternate segment theorem), the angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of contact is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. [ angle M B A = angle B A C ] Thus, angle BMA is half the arc AB since it is subtended by this arc.

This angle equals half the difference of the arcs intercepted by the secant.

Since at least one of ( F_{n-1} ) and ( F_{n-2} ) is odd, the AP is either always odd or alternates between even and odd. We need: [ a leq frac{m - F_{n-2}}{F_{n-1}} < frac{m}{F_{n-1}} ] After some point, this cannot be an integer, say, after ( n_0 ). For each ( n leq n_0 ), we have at most: [ frac{1}{2} cdot frac{m}{F_{n-1}} ] distinct even integers in the AP with the first term ( F_n ).

Specifically, since (7) is prime, (n^6 equiv 1 pmod{7}) for any (n notequiv 0 pmod{7}). 3. **Possible values of cubes modulo 7**: For any integer (n), (n^3) modulo 7 can be determined.

Once the president is chosen, there are (n - 1) choices left for the vice president, because the same person cannot hold both positions. The number of ways to select a president and vice president is therefore the product of the number of choices for each position, which is n * (n - 1). According to the information given, there are 72 ways to select a president and vice president.

Then, all cells that are covered by an odd number of squares are marked. Prove that the number of marked cells is at least the number of cells in one square.","completion":"1. **Introduce Terminology:** We will refer to the identical squares placed on the grid as \\"tiles.\\" Each tile has sides aligned with the grid lines of the plane. 2. **Grid Coordinates:** Let's consider every cell on the grid and assign them coordinates based on their position. The ( i )-th row and ( j )-th column cell will be denoted as cell ((i, j)). 3. **Covering Cells:** When a tile covers a cell, it means that the cell lies within the bounds of the tile. Since there are 2009 tiles, each placed on integer coordinates of the grid, the total number of cells covered will vary depending on whether multiple tiles overlap on certain cells. 4. **Count Check:** Notice that every cell covered by one tile may overlap with other tiles, leading to certain cells being \\"covered\\" multiple times. Specifically, we need to focus on cells that are covered by an odd number of tiles. 5. **Parity Argument:** The crucial part of this solution relies on the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of tiles covering a cell. If a cell is covered by an odd number of tiles, it has unique standing, and we will mark it. 6. **Summation Insight:** We now look at each covered cell and write down the number of tiles covering it. Let's denote this number for the cell at ((i, j)) as ( n_{ij} ). - The total sum ( S ) of all ( n_{ij} ) across all cells will equal the total number of tile placements (since this simply counts each tile exactly once for each cell it covers): [ S = sum_{i,j} n_{ij} = 2009. ] 7. **Odd Contributions:** Since 2009 is an odd number, and knowing that the sum of all ( n_{ij} ) is 2009, it follows that at least one ( n_{ij} ) must be odd. More precisely, there must be an odd number of odd ( n_{ij} ) contributing to the sum. If there were an even number of odd ( n_{ij} ), their sum would be even, contradicting 2009 being odd. 8. **Minimum Marked Cells:** Thus, the number of cells covered by an odd number of tiles is at least the number of these tile placements.

Since a_1 is an irrational number between 0 and 1, it follows by mathematical induction using properties of irrational numbers and the floor function (specifically, the continued fraction representation of irrational numbers) that a_n will always be irrational and 0 < a_n < 1. 4. Additionally: [ frac{1}{a_n} - leftlfloor frac{1}{a_n} rightrfloor < 1 ] implies that: [ 1 < a_n + leftlfloor frac{1}{a_n} rightrfloor a_n ] hence: [ a_{n+1} = 1 - leftlfloor frac{1}{a_n} rightrfloor a_n < a_n ] Therefore, {a_n} is a strictly decreasing sequence.

Step 1: Properties of LCM Recall the property of the least common multiple (LCM): - The LCM of a set of numbers is divisible by each of the numbers in the set. Consequently, it is also divisible by every divisor of these numbers. - If any of the numbers is even, their LCM will also be even. Step 2: Analysis of Consecutive Numbers Consider six consecutive natural numbers. Without loss of generality, let's denote them as: [ n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5 ] Among these six numbers, there will be exactly three even numbers and three odd numbers. Step 3: Implications for the LCM Since three of these numbers are even: - The LCM of three numbers including at least one even number must be even. - The LCM of three numbers that do not include an even number but include odd numbers is odd. The difference between an even number and an odd number is odd, and the difference between two even numbers or two odd numbers is even. Step 4: Evaluating the Difference Thus, consider the following two cases: 1. The LCMs are split such that each contains a mix of even and odd numbers. 2. The LCMs are such that one LCM (set of three numbers) contains all even numbers, and the other contains all odd numbers. In both cases, the difference (D = text{LCM}(E_1, E_2, E_3) - text{LCM}(O_1, O_2, O_3)) would be: - Odd if one LCM contains even and the other contains odd numbers. - Even if both LCMs are either even or both are odd. Given that (2009) is odd, the first case might seem possible, but we'll see if it holds true. Step 5: Divisibility by 3 Next, consider any set of three consecutive numbers: - Any set of three consecutive integers contains a number divisible by 3. Therefore, both groups of three numbers (even or odd) in sets of six consecutive numbers will have an LCM that is divisible by 3. Recall that (2009) is not divisible by 3 as: [ 2009 div 3 approx 669.67 quad (text{not an integer}) ] Conclusion: Thus, the difference of any two LCMs derived from six consecutive natural numbers cannot be (2009) because: 1. The LCMs of consecutive sets are always multiples of 3. 2. The difference between any two sets must therefore result in a multiple of 3. Since (2009) does not satisfy this criterion, there are no six consecutive natural numbers that satisfy the equation: [ text{LCM}(*, *, *) - text{LCM}(*, *, *) = 2009 ] [ boxed{text{No such six consecutive natural numbers exist.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the center of the ellipse C is at the origin, its foci lie on the xaxis, the focal distance is 2, and the eccentricity is frac{1}{2}.

The coordinates of the vertex (h, k) of the parabola defined by this quadratic function can be found using the formulas: h = frac{-b}{2a} quad text{and} quad k = frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}. To find h, we simply apply the formula: h = frac{-b}{2a}. For k, we plug the values of a, b, c into the formula: k = frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}. In summary, the vertex coordinates (h, k) are given by: (h, k) = left(frac{-b}{2a}, frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}right). Therefore, the answer is: The general form of a quadratic function is y = ax^2 + bx + c (where a neq 0 and a, b, c are constants), and the vertex coordinates are left(boxed{frac{-b}{2a}}, boxed{frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}}right)."},{"prompt":"Find the largest integer value of n such that n^211n+28 is negative.","completion":"First, write the inequality: [ n^2 - 11n + 28 < 0 ] Factoring this expression, we get: [ (n-4)(n-7) < 0 ] Here, the roots are 4 and 7, indicating where the quadratic changes its sign. - For n<4, both (n-4) and (n-7) are negative, thus making their product positive. - For 4<n<7, (n-4) is positive and (n-7) is negative, resulting in the product being negative. - For n>7, both (n-4) and (n-7) are positive, making their product positive.

From the equation (4n + 1 = a^2), we can solve for (n): [ 4n + 1 = a^2 implies 4n = a^2 - 1 implies n = frac{a^2 - 1}{4} ] Since (n) must be an integer, (a^2 - 1) must be divisible by 4. Notice that (a^2 - 1 = (a - 1)(a + 1)). For this product to be divisible by 4, (a) must be odd (since the product of two consecutive even or odd numbers is always divisible by 4). 3. Let (a = 2k + 1) for some integer (k). Then: [ a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 ] Substituting this back into the equation for (n): [ 4n + 1 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 implies 4n = 4k^2 + 4k implies n = k^2 + k ] 4. Now, substitute (n = k^2 + k) into the second condition (9n + 1 = b^2): [ 9(k^2 + k) + 1 = b^2 implies 9k^2 + 9k + 1 = b^2 ] This can be rewritten as: [ b^2 - 9k^2 - 9k - 1 = 0 ] 5. To solve for (k), we rearrange the equation: [ b^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ] We need (b^2) to be a perfect square. Let (b = m), then: [ m^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ] 6. We can rewrite this as: [ m^2 - 9k^2 - 9k - 1 = 0 ] This is a quadratic in (m): [ m^2 = 9k^2 + 9k + 1 ] 7. To solve for (m), we use the fact that (m^2 - 4b^2 = 5): [ 4b^2 + 5 = m^2 implies (m - 2b)(m + 2b) = 5 ] Since (m) and (b) are integers, the factor pairs of 5 are ((1, 5)) and ((-1, -5)).

Since y gets Rs. 0.45 for each unit, we can calculate the number of units by dividing y's share by the amount y gets per unit: Number of units = Share of y / Amount y gets per unit Number of units = Rs. 45 / Rs. 0.45 Number of units = 100 Now that we know there are 100 units distributed, we can calculate the total amount by adding the shares of x, y, and z: Total amount = (Share of x per unit * Number of units) + (Share of y per unit * Number of units) + (Share of z per unit * Number of units) Total amount = (Rs. 1 * 100) + (Rs. 0.45 * 100) + (Rs. 0.50 * 100) Total amount = Rs. 100 + Rs. 45 + Rs. 50 Total amount = Rs. 195 Therefore, the total amount is Rs. boxed{195} ."},{"prompt":"Find the sum of the following series: [ frac{0}{1} + frac{1}{1} + frac{0}{2} + frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{2} + frac{0}{3} + frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{3} + frac{3}{3} + frac{0}{4} + frac{1}{4} + frac{2}{4} + frac{3}{4} + frac{4}{4} + frac{0}{5} + frac{1}{5} + frac{2}{5} + frac{3}{5} + frac{4}{5} + frac{5}{5} + frac{0}{6} + frac{1}{6} + frac{2}{6} + frac{3}{6} + frac{4}{6} + frac{5}{6} + frac{6}{6}. ]","completion":"We need to find the sum of the series of fractions given by: frac{0}{1} + frac{1}{1} + frac{0}{2} + frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{2} + frac{0}{3} + frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{3} + frac{3}{3} + frac{0}{4} + frac{1}{4} + frac{2}{4} + frac{3}{4} + frac{4}{4} + frac{0}{5} + frac{1}{5} + frac{2}{5} + frac{3}{5} + frac{4}{5} + frac{5}{5} + frac{0}{6} + frac{1}{6} + frac{2}{6} + frac{3}{6} + frac{4}{6} + frac{5}{6} + frac{6}{6}.

We need to determine whether the sum of all the 2001 numbers is positive. 1. Let the given numbers be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2001} ). 2. Consider summing all these numbers. We denote the sum of all 2001 numbers as ( S ), i.e., [ S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ldots + a_{2001}. ] 3. We are told that the sum of any four numbers out of these 2001 numbers is positive.

Suppose we partition these 2001 numbers into subsets of four numbers each (except one subset which will have an odd number due to 2001 being odd). In each subset of four numbers, the sum is positive. 5. However, this reasoning itself doesn't directly imply the positivity of the entire sum. Instead, consider taking all possible quadruples of numbers.

For a more solid argument, consider the minimum value ( m ) that any sum of four numbers can take. Since any four numbers out of the 2001 have a positive sum, ( m ) must be greater than zero. Given the uniform scenario over numerous valid partitions, this indicates that negative influences within the large set are minimal or altogether non-existent. 7.

We can write (12) as a product of its prime factors: [ 12 = 2^2 cdot 3^1. ] This means that the sum of the exponents of the prime factors is (2 + 1 = 3), which is an odd number. 2. **Effect of Operations on Exponents:** Each operation (multiplication or division by (2) or (3)) changes the sum of the exponents by (1): - Multiplying by (2) or (3) increases the corresponding exponent by (1). - Dividing by (2) or (3) decreases the corresponding exponent by (1). 3. **Total Number of Operations:** Given that exactly (60) seconds elapse, and one operation occurs each second, the total number of operations performed is (60). 4. **Parity (Even or Odd Nature) of Exponents Sum Transformation:** Since each operation changes the sum of the exponents by (1), an odd number of operations will switch the parity of the sum (odd -> even or even -> odd), and an even number of operations will preserve the parity of the sum. Here, (60) is an even number, so the parity of the initial sum of the exponents ((3)) remains the same (odd). 5. **Prime Factorization of the Target Number:** Now, consider the number (54).

How many dice are being tossed?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible outcomes when dice are tossed and the prime numbers that can be obtained as the sum of the dice. First, let's consider the possible outcomes when a single die is tossed. A die has 6 faces with numbers from 1 to 6. The prime numbers in this range are 2, 3, and 5. However, a single die cannot have a total score of 2 since it's the result of two dice showing 1 each. So, for a single die, the probability of rolling a prime number (either 3 or 5) is 2/6 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333333333, which is not the probability we are looking for. Now, let's consider two dice. The smallest sum we can get is 2 (1+1) and the largest is 12 (6+6). The prime numbers in this range are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. To find the probability of rolling a prime number with two dice, we need to count the number of ways to get each prime number and divide by the total number of outcomes (which is 6 * 6 = 36 for two dice). - For a sum of 2, there is 1 way (1+1). - For a sum of 3, there are 2 ways (1+2, 2+1). - For a sum of 5, there are 4 ways (1+4, 4+1, 2+3, 3+2). - For a sum of 7, there are 6 ways (1+6, 6+1, 2+5, 5+2, 3+4, 4+3). - For a sum of 11, there are 2 ways (5+6, 6+5). Adding these up, we have 1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 15 ways to get a prime number. So the probability with two dice is 15/36 = 5/12 ≈ 0.4166666667, which matches the probability we are looking for.

We need to find a k such that n - f(n) = k has exactly 3 solutions. - Choose k = 6. We need to verify that there are exactly 3 values of n such that n - f(n) = 6. - For n - f(n) = 6, we have f(n) = n - 6. Since f(n) is the largest divisor of n other than n itself, f(n) must be a divisor of n. - Therefore, n - 6 must be a divisor of n. Let d = n - 6. Then n = d + 6 and d must divide d + 6. - This implies d divides 6. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. However, d = 6 is not valid because f(n) neq n. - Therefore, the valid divisors are d = 1, 2, 3. This gives us n = 7, 8, 9. - Thus, there are exactly 3 solutions for n - f(n) = 6, confirming the base case. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume that for some integer m, the equation n - f(n) = m has exactly x solutions and m + 1 is a prime number. - We need to show that there exists an integer Q - 1 such that n - f(n) = Q - 1 has exactly x + 1 solutions, where Q is a prime number. - By the definition of f(n), f(n) = frac{n}{text{smallest prime divisor of } n}. - The number of solutions of n - f(n) = y equals the number of prime numbers q such that for any prime number f < q, we have V_f(q - 1) = V_f(y). - Let the proper divisors of m be p_1 < p_2 < cdots < p_x. We know that there are x such primes and m + 1 is the largest such prime number, hence p_x = m + 1. - There are infinitely many prime numbers s such that V_e(s - 1) = V_e(m) for all prime numbers e less than p_x. - Choose the smallest such prime number greater than p_x = m + 1, say Q. Since all prime divisors of m are less than p_x, we get m | Q - 1. - Hence, p_1, p_2, cdots, p_x are all proper divisors of Q - 1. Additionally, Q > p_x is a proper divisor of Q - 1. - Assume Q - 1 has a proper divisor different from p_1 < p_2 < cdots < p_x < Q. Let this prime number be r. Evidently, Q > r. - If p_x > r, then for any prime number w < r, we get V_w(r - 1) = V_w(Q - 1) = V_w(p_x - 1). Then, r is a proper divisor of m = p_x - 1, which leads to a contradiction. - If r > p_x, then for any prime number w < p_x < r, we get V_w(r - 1) = V_w(Q - 1) = V_w(p_x - 1) = V_w(m). However, Q was the smallest prime divisor greater than p_x that satisfies this condition. As Q > r > p_x, we get a contradiction. - Therefore, all the proper divisors of Q - 1 are p_1 < p_2 < cdots < p_x < Q, hence a total of x + 1 proper divisors. - Thus, the equation n - f(n) = Q - 1 has exactly x + 1 solutions where Q is a prime number.

For every 1 mole of Al2O3 produced, 3 moles of H2 are produced (according to the balanced equation).

The shuffle operation transforms the sequence into ( { n+1, 1, n+2, 2, dots, 2n, n } ). In this operation, the original ( n ) cards move to the positions ( 2, 4, dots, 2n ), and the remaining ( n ) cards are placed in the odd positions in their original order. 2. **Mathematical Formulation:** To better understand the shuffle, we examine the effect of a single shuffle on two categories of card positions: - Cards originally at even indices ( 1, 2, ldots, n ). - Cards originally at odd indices ( n+1, n+2, ldots, 2n ). Assuming ( x ) is the card at position ( i ) initially, after one shuffle we have: [ y equiv 2x pmod{2n+1} ] This transformation is used because every time we double the index modulo ( 2n+1 ), we capture the effect of placing cards in their new positions. 3. **Iteration Over Shuffles:** We need to determine how many shuffle operations, ( k ), are required such that every card returns to its original position.

The median line ( CC_1 ) can be represented parametrically from ( C left( 3x, 0 right) ) to ( C_1 left( frac{a}{2}, frac{b}{2} right) ): Suppose ( P ) divides ( CC_1 ) in the ratio ( r:1 ): [ P = left( frac{3x cdot 1 + frac{a}{2} cdot r}{r+1}, frac{0 cdot 1 + frac{b}{2} cdot r}{r+1} right) = left( frac{3x + frac{ar}{2}}{r+1}, frac{frac{br}{2}}{r+1} right) ] 8. **Equating Parameter Positions**: Equate the parametric coordinates to actual coordinates on the segment: [ frac{a + 2kx}{k+1} = frac{3x + frac{ar}{2}}{r+1} quad text{and} quad frac{b}{k+1} = frac{frac{br}{2}}{r+1} ] 9. **Derive Ratio ( r )**: Solve for ( k ) to find its relation to ( r ): [ frac{a + 2kx}{k+1} = frac{3x + frac{ar}{2}}{r+1} quad text{which evaluates} quad frac{b}{k+1} = frac{br}{2(r+1)} implies r = 2(k+1) ] Solving for ( k ) yields: [ k = 3 ] 10. **Concluding Ratio**: The segment ( AA_1 ) is divided by ( CC_1 ) in the ratio ( 3:1 ). # Conclusion: The median ( CC_1 ) divides the segment ( AA_1 ) in the ratio ( 3:1 ), considering the division starts from vertex ( A ).

This can be visualized by considering the nature of a quadrilateral that can change shape while maintaining the lengths of its sides due to the flexibility provided by the vertices. 2. **Flexibility of Quadrilaterals**: Imagine holding two opposite vertices of a quadrilateral and trying to move them closer or further apart while keeping the sides' lengths intact. This movement is possible and results in a change in the shape of the quadrilateral. 3. **Example Illustration**: The referenced diagram shows two positions of a quadrilateral with the same side lengths but different shapes. This demonstrates that a quadrilateral can have fixed sides and still change its shape, concluding that quadrilaterals with corresponding equal sides are not necessarily congruent. 4. **Comparison with Triangle Congruence**: The principles of triangle congruence (such as SSS, SAS, ASA) work because the shape of a triangle is determined uniquely by three specific measurements (sides or angles). For example, if two sides and the included angle are known, the third side and other angles can be determined uniquely, fixing the shape. 5. **Triangle Congruence Theorems**: - **SSS (Side-Side-Side)**: Three sides known. - **SAS (Side-Angle-Side)**: Two sides and the included angle known. - **ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)**: Two angles and the included side known. In contrast, quadrilaterals do not follow such rigorous determination rules from the sides alone. Additional information (angles or diagonals) is needed to fix the shape uniquely. 6. **Conclusion**: The given claim that quadrilaterals with corresponding equal sides are congruent is false, as equal side lengths alone do not determine a unique shape for a quadrilateral.

However, in a regular hexagon of side length greater than 1, placing a point within a distance of less than 1 unit from each vertex is geometrically restrictive. 4. **Point ( M ):** Given point ( M ) is inside the hexagon and within 1 unit from any vertex implies that ( M ) must lie quite close to every vertex, which introduces practical challenges since the distinct vertices are spread out. 5. **Distance Consideration:** If we assume the distance from ( M ) to every vertex (A_i) must be less than 1. Let’s call (d(M, A_i) < 1) where ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 6 ). 6. **Testing the Configuration:** - Vertices are spaced more than 1 unit apart explicitly. For a point within the interior to be within the threshold (d < 1) from each spatially distant vertex contradicts positioning due to Euclidean limitations. - In the case of any non-regular hexagon where all sides are more than 1 unit and vertices are similarly confined, fitting a point (M) centrally distanced consistent with the principle d(M, A_i) < 1 is fundamentally infeasible. 7. **Conclusion:** - For any convex hexagon satisfying the side length constraint (> 1), the creation of point (M) that remains consistently within 1 unit of each vertex leads to geometrical invalidity. Therefore, such a hexagon and a point (M) satisfying both given conditions cannot exist.

In any triangle, the length of the hypotenuse (or any side opposite to the larger angle) is greater than the length of its projection: - Since BD is the hypotenuse: BD > frac{AB}{2} Hence, from this inequality: BC = 2BD > AB But point D lies between B and C, so: BC > frac{AB}{2} Therefore, we conclude that the length of side BC is greater than half the length of side AB.

When a ≤ 0, f'(x) > 0, and the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (0, +∞), thus it has no extreme value. When a > 0, f'(x) = frac{-a(x - frac{1}{a})}{x}.

Drawing overline{AF}, we identify it as the third median of triangle ABC. **Step 3: Concurrency of Medians** - The medians of a triangle are always concurrent, meaning they intersect at a single point. - Therefore, overline{AF}, overline{BE}, and overline{CD} intersect at point X. **Step 4: Dividing the Triangle into Smaller Triangles** - The three medians divide triangle ABC into six smaller triangles of equal area. This is because: - triangle BXF and triangle CXF have the same base (overline{XF}) and height, thus the same area. - Similarly, triangle ABF and triangle ACF have the same base (overline{AF}) and height, thus the same area. - By extending this logic, all six triangles formed by the medians have equal areas. **Step 5: Comparing Areas of Quadrilateral AEXD and Triangle BXC** - Quadrilateral AEXD consists of two of these smaller triangles. - Triangle BXC also consists of two of these smaller triangles. - Therefore, the area of quadrilateral AEXD is equal to the area of triangle BXC. **Conclusion:** The ratio of the area of quadrilateral AEXD to the area of triangle BXC is equal to the ratio of their areas, which is 1:1.

For ①, we consider the condition that vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} cannot form a basis with any vector in space. This implies that there is no vector overrightarrow{v} in space such that {overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{v}} are linearly independent. The only scenario where this holds true is when overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are collinear, meaning they are parallel to each other. Thus, proposition ① is correct. Moving on to ②, we are given that non-zero vectors overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, and overrightarrow{c} satisfy overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{b} perp overrightarrow{c}. However, the orthogonality of overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}, and overrightarrow{b} and overrightarrow{c}, does not provide enough information to conclude the direction of overrightarrow{a} relative to overrightarrow{c}. They could be orthogonal, parallel, or neither, depending on their specific orientations in space. Therefore, proposition ② is incorrect. For ③, if overrightarrow{OA}, overrightarrow{OB}, overrightarrow{OC} are a set of basis vectors in space, then A, B, and C are not collinear, and any point in space can be expressed as a combination of these vectors. Given overrightarrow{OD} = frac{1}{3}overrightarrow{OA} + frac{1}{3}overrightarrow{OB} + frac{1}{3}overrightarrow{OC}, point D can be represented as a linear combination of overrightarrow{OA}, overrightarrow{OB}, and overrightarrow{OC}, which means D lies in the plane defined by A, B, and C.

Lastly, for ④, if vectors overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{b} + overrightarrow{c}, overrightarrow{c} + overrightarrow{a} form a set of basis vectors in space, then any vector overrightarrow{d} in space can be uniquely expressed as overrightarrow{d} = x(overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) + y(overrightarrow{b} + overrightarrow{c}) + z(overrightarrow{c} + overrightarrow{a}). Simplifying, we get overrightarrow{d} = (x+z)overrightarrow{a} + (x+y)overrightarrow{b} + (y+z)overrightarrow{c}. This expression shows that any vector in space can be uniquely represented as a linear combination of overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, and overrightarrow{c}, indicating that these vectors also form a basis.

By construction, angle ACB = 90^circ and angle ADB = 90^circ because they are angles inscribed in a semicircle (Thales' theorem). 2. **Intersection Points** The lines (AC) and (BD) intersect at point E, and the lines (AD) and (BC) intersect at point F. These points define the new segments [EF] and [CD]. 3. **Cyclic Quadrilateral** Consider the quadrilateral ACBD. Since C and D lie on the semicircle, angle ACB = 90^circ and angle ADB = 90^circ. This means that quadrilateral ACBD can be inscribed in a circle. 4. **Perpendicularity in the New Quadrilateral** As a consequence of the above, angle FCE = 90^circ and angle FDE = 90^circ. This shows that points C and D also lie on a circle with diameter [EF]. Therefore, F, C, D, and E form another cyclic quadrilateral. 5. **Midpoints and Center** Let M be the midpoint of [EF]. Since M is the center of the circle with diameter [EF], it follows that MC = MD because they are both radii of the same circle. Therefore, M lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment [CD]. 6. **Midpoint of [AB]** Similarly, let O be the midpoint of [AB]. Since O is also the center of a circle (the original semicircle) in which C and D lie, O lies on the perpendicular bisector of [CD]. 7. **Alignment of Midpoints** By definition, the perpendicular bisector of [CD] passes through the midpoint of [CD].

We need to prove that there exists an ( n ) such that ( D_2(n) = 999 D_3(n) ). 1. **Prime Factorization and Divisors**: Let ( n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} cdots p_k^{a_k} ) be the prime factorization of ( n ). A divisor ( d ) of ( n ) can be written as ( d = p_1^{b_1} p_2^{b_2} cdots p_k^{b_k} ) where ( 0 le b_i le a_i ) for all ( 1 le i le k ). 2. **Perfect Square Divisors**: A divisor ( d ) is a perfect square if and only if all ( b_i ) are even. Therefore, the number of perfect square divisors of ( n ) is: [ D_2(n) = prod_{i=1}^k left( leftlfloor frac{a_i}{2} rightrfloor + 1 right) ] 3. **Perfect Cube Divisors**: A divisor ( d ) is a perfect cube if and only if all ( b_i ) are multiples of 3. Therefore, the number of perfect cube divisors of ( n ) is: [ D_3(n) = prod_{i=1}^k left( leftlfloor frac{a_i}{3} rightrfloor + 1 right) ] 4. **Defining Functions**: Let ( d_2(a) = leftlfloor frac{a}{2} rightrfloor + 1 ) and ( d_3(a) = leftlfloor frac{a}{3} rightrfloor + 1 ). We need to find ( n ) such that: [ prod_{i=1}^k d_2(a_i) = 999 prod_{i=1}^k d_3(a_i) ] 5. **Calculating Specific Values**: - For ( a = 2 ): ( d_2(2) = 2 ), ( d_3(2) = 1 ). Therefore, ( frac{d_2(2)}{d_3(2)} = 2 ). - For ( a = 4 ): ( d_2(4) = 3 ), ( d_3(4) = 2 ). Therefore, ( frac{d_2(4)}{d_3(4)} = frac{3}{2} ). - For ( a = 8 ): ( d_2(8) = 5 ), ( d_3(8) = 3 ). Therefore, ( frac{d_2(8)}{d_3(8)} = frac{5}{3} ). - For ( a = 72 ): ( d_2(72) = 37 ), ( d_3(72) = 25 ). Therefore, ( frac{d_2(72)}{d_3(72)} = frac{37}{25} ). 6. **Combining Factors**: We need to find a combination of these factors to achieve the ratio ( 999 ). Notice that: [ 999 = 37 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 3 = frac{37}{25} cdot left(frac{5}{3}right)^2 cdot left(frac{3}{2}right)^5 cdot 2^5 ] 7. **Constructing ( n )**: Let ( n = p_1^{37} cdot prod_{i=2}^3 p_i^8 cdot prod_{i=4}^8 p_i^4 cdot prod_{i=9}^{13} p_i^2 ), where ( p_1, ldots, p_{13} ) are any 13 distinct primes.

Operation P(x) involves removing all tiles numbered as a perfect square, then removing tiles as perfect cubes, and finally renumbering the remaining tiles. 2. **Perfect Squares and Cubes in Range**: - Perfect squares between 1 and 150: 1^2 to 12^2 (since 12^2 = 144 and 13^2 = 169 > 150). Thus, there are 12 perfect squares. - Perfect cubes between 1 and 150: 1^3 to 5^3 (since 5^3 = 125 and 6^3 = 216 > 150). Thus, there are 5 perfect cubes. 3. **Operation Application**: - Initial Number: 150 - Remove 12 squares: 150 - 12 = 138 - Remove 5 additional cubes: 138 - 5 = 133. We count only distinct numbers. We need to check overlaps, like 64 which is both 8^2 and 4^3. There are overlaps at 1^2 = 1^3, 4^2 = 2^3, 9^2 = 3^3. Since all cubes are squares here, only 2 numbers (8, and 64) are removed as cubes.

Let's denote the selling price of component A as P_A and the selling price of component B as P_B. The total revenue (R) can be calculated as follows: R = (P_A * 200) + (P_B * 300) We want the total revenue to be at least equal to the total costs: R >= 51,500 Substituting the values, we get: (200 * P_A) + (300 * P_B) >= 51,500 Now, we need to find the values of P_A and P_B. Since we are looking for the lowest price, let's assume that the manufacturer wants to set the same price for both components. In that case, P_A = P_B = P.

To achieve the condition that the degree of f(x) + g(x) is 2, the degrees of all terms higher than x^2 in f(x) must be cancelled by corresponding terms in g(x). 2.

Because (ABCD) is a rhombus, the diagonals intersect at (O) and they bisect each other at right angles. 3. **Coordinates and angles:** We need to establish that (angle AOE = angle CFO). Let (angle AOE = theta). Drop a perpendicular (OX) from (O) to side (AB). Notice that (angle AOX = frac{B}{2}), therefore (angle XOE = theta - frac{B}{2}). 4. **Tangency condition:** If (EF) is tangent to the incircle at point (Y), it must be that (angle EOY = angle XOE), hence (angle EOY = theta - frac{B}{2}). 5. **Angle analysis using tangency:** Consider (angle BEF = 2(theta - frac{B}{2}) = 2theta - B). From the tangent condition, we deduce that: [ angle BFE = 180^circ - 2theta ] Therefore, we get [ angle CFE = 2theta ] Hence, (angle CFO = theta). 6. **Establish similarity of triangles:** We have established that (angle AOE = angle CFO). Since (ABCD) is a rhombus, (angle EAO = angle OCF). Therefore, triangles (AOE) and (CFO) are similar by AA similarity criterion. Using the properties of similar triangles: [ frac{AE}{AO} = frac{CO}{CF} ] Consequently, [ AE times CF = AO^2 ] 7. **Similar steps for AH and CG:** Similarly, considering triangle (AHO) and (CGO), we get: [ AH times CG = AO^2 ] 8. **Relate AH/AE and CF/CG:** From the established proportionalities, we can write: [ frac{AH}{AE} = frac{CF}{CG} ] This implies that triangles (AHE) and (CFG) are similar by SAS similarity criterion.

Let ( E' ) be a point on the circumcircle of ( ABDC ) such that ( EE' parallel BC ). Let ( D' ) be the intersection of ( AE' ) and ( BC ).

Let's differentiate the function f(x) = frac{a}{3}x^3 - frac{3}{2}x^2 + (a+1)x + 1 to find the extremum. We get f'(x) = ax^2 - 3x + a + 1. Since f(x) has an extremum at x=1, we plug in the value into the derivative: f'(1) = a(1)^2 - 3(1) + a + 1 = 2a - 2. For an extremum, the first derivative should be zero, hence 2a - 2 = 0.

First, we need to simplify i^{2023}. Since i^2 = -1, we can express i^{2023} as (i^2)^{1011} cdot i. This simplifies to (-1)^{1011} cdot i = -i because (-1)^{1011} = -1. 2. Substituting -i for i^{2023} in the given equation (1+i^{2023})z=1+i, we get (1 - i)z = 1 + i. 3. To find z, we solve the equation (1 - i)z = 1 + i. This can be done by multiplying both sides by the conjugate of 1 - i, which is 1 + i, to get rid of the complex denominator. So, z = frac{1+i}{1-i}. 4. Multiplying the numerator and the denominator by 1+i, we get z = frac{(1+i)(1+i)}{(1-i)(1+i)}. Simplifying the numerator, (1+i)(1+i) = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i. Simplifying the denominator, (1-i)(1+i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Thus, z = frac{2i}{2} = i. 5. The conjugate of z, denoted as bar{z}, is the complex number with the same real part and the negated imaginary part. Since z = i, bar{z} = -i. 6.

Consider a cube with dimensions composed of 2n times 2n times 2n unit cubes. The cube is pierced by several rods (or spikes), each parallel to one of the edges of the cube. Each spike pierces exactly 2n unit cubes, and each unit cube is pierced by at least one spike. Part (a) 2. To demonstrate that it is possible to select 2n spikes that are aligned along one or two directions such that no two of these spikes pierce the same unit cube, we start by investigating the arrangement of these spikes: 3. Assume the edges of the cube are aligned parallel to the coordinate axes Ox, Oy, and Oz. 4. Decompose the entire cube into layers of thickness 1, all parallel to the Oxy plane. Within each layer, spikes can be oriented along the Ox or Oy directions. 5. For each layer: - Identify the maximum number of spikes oriented in one particular direction (either Ox or Oy). Let these maximum counts be denoted by (M_{Ox}) and (M_{Oy}). 6. The above logic applies similarly to layers parallel to the Oxz and Oyz planes. Let these maximum counts be denoted by (M_{Oy}), (M_{Oz}), (M_{Oz}), and (M_{Ox}). 7. Define (k) as the minimum value among the numbers of maximum spikes across all layers: [ k = min(M_{Ox1}, M_{Ox2}, M_{Oy1}, M_{Oy2}, M_{Oz1}, M_{Oz2}) ] 8. Pick a layer where this maximum is equal to (k). In such a layer, we can choose (2n-k) rows and (2n-k) columns through which no spikes run. 9. The intersection of these chosen rows and columns will yield ((2n-k)^2) unit cubes, which are not pierced by any of the spikes in this layer. 10. However, each of these unit cubes is pierced exactly once by a spike perpendicular to this layer, giving rise to ( (2n-k)^2 ) spikes perpendicular to this layer. Color these spikes blue. 11. Consider any face of the cube (without loss of generality, one perpendicular to the selected direction). In the layers parallel to this face and void of any blue spikes, we can select at least (k) spikes in one direction. 12. The total number of selected spikes is therefore: [ 2n leq k + (2n - k)^2 ] 13. According to the well-known inequality (AB leq frac{1}{2}[(A + B)^2]^frac{1}{2}): [ text{If (k_i) and ((2nk_j + k_k)leq(2n^frac{1}{2})}) ] 14. By applying the condition we derive (2n): [ boxed{2n} ] Part (b) Continuing with part (b): 15. Consider the cube divided into two smaller cubes, each with side length (n), touching at opposing vertices. 16. Each of these smaller cubes will be composed of (2n^3) unit cubes: [ 2n^3 quad text{unit cubes} ] 17. Insert three mutually perpendicular spikes through each unit cube. This ensures that each spike passes through exactly one unit cube of side (n). 18. Notice that each spike in one smaller cube does not intersect with any spikes in the other smaller cube. Thus, each spike penetrates exactly (2n) unit cubes of the dimension (1) cubes split into smaller cubes. 19. Since all cubes are fully pierced: [ 2n quad text{(remaining spikes})^2 ] 20. Thus, the maximum guaranteed number of spikes chosen so no two selected spikes pierce the same cube is (2 cdot n^2): [ boxed{2n} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the sequence {a_n} satisfies a_1=33 and a_{n+1}a_n=2n, find the expression for a_n.","completion":"Since a_{n+1}-a_n=2n, we have: - a_2-a_1=2 - a_3-a_2=4 - dots - a_n-a_{n-1}=2n-2 Adding up the above n-1 equations, we get a_n-a_1=2+4+dots+2n-2= frac{2+2n-2}{2}times(n-1)=n^2-n.

The cube has 6 faces: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. - Therefore, the ant needs to make 6 moves (since it starts and ends at the same face). 3. **Calculate the number of paths from the starting face to another face**: - There are 4 neighboring faces that the ant can move to from any given starting face. Thus, for the first move, there are 4 possible directions. 4. **Determine the sequence of visiting all faces**: - After the first move, the ant has to visit all remaining faces exactly once and then return to the starting face. Once it has chosen the next face, there are specific sequences it must follow. 5. **Visualize the sequences**: - Let's consider sequences starting from the front face (denoted as F). Each sequence must end back at F after visiting every other face exactly once. 6. **Enumerate possible sequence**: - Given the ant’s movement from one face to an adjacent face and ensuring each face is visited exactly once before returning to the starting face, there are exactly 8 possible distinct traversal sequences for any starting face. The sequences can be represented as shown in the question's provided solutions, for example: [ begin{align*} F rightarrow T rightarrow B rightarrow R rightarrow D rightarrow L rightarrow F F rightarrow T rightarrow B rightarrow L rightarrow D rightarrow R rightarrow F F rightarrow T rightarrow L rightarrow D rightarrow B rightarrow R rightarrow F F rightarrow T rightarrow L rightarrow B rightarrow R rightarrow D rightarrow F qquad text{(and 4 more similar sequences)} end{align*} ] 7. **Generalize for all starting faces**: - Since this sequence calculation will be the same regardless of the face the ant starts from, we need to account for each of the 4 starting faces of a cube (front, top, left, right, bottom, back). Therefore, the total number of sequences from all possible starting points. 8. **Multiply by number of possible starting faces**: - Since there are 4 adjacent moves from any starting face, and each face has 8 sequences, we calculate: [ 4 text{ (starting moves)} times 8 text{ (possible sequences)} = 32 ] Conclusively, the total number of distinct sequences the ant can take to visit each face exactly once and return to the starting point is: [ boxed{32} ]"},{"prompt":"f x > 0, y > 0, and x+2y=1, then the range of values for frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} is _______ .","completion":"Given that x > 0, y > 0, and x+2y=1, we have: frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} = (frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y})(x+2y) = 1 + frac{x}{y} + 2 + frac{2y}{x} geqslant 3 + 2 sqrt{frac{x}{y} cdot frac{2y}{x}} = 3 + 2 sqrt{2}.

For 450x to be a multiple of 800, the prime factorization of 450x must include the entire prime factorization of 800. Since 800 has 2^5 and 5^2 as prime factors: - The 5^2 part is already covered by the 5^2 in 450. - The prime factorization of 450 has 2^1, but 800 needs 2^5. Therefore, x must include four more factors of 2 to make up for this deficiency and provide the 2^4 additional factors required. Thus, the smallest such x is 2^4 = 16. Checking this, 450 cdot 16 = 7200. Factorizing 7200 gives 2^4 cdot 3^2 cdot 5^2, which must be compared to 800 = 2^5 cdot 5^2.

We introduce the points M_1 and M_2, which are the orthogonal projections of M onto lines AC and BD, respectively. Let the distances MM_1 and MM_2 be denoted by m_1 and m_2.

The average weight of these 8 persons is therefore W/8. When a new person comes in and replaces one of the original 8, the average weight increases by 3 kg.

The distance between any two vertices is constant, c. The origin O is at (0,0,ldots,0), and A_0 is at (1,0,0,ldots,0). Each vertex A_i is at a distance of 1 from the origin. We need to find the sum of the squares of the distances from a point P = (20, 14, 20, 14, ldots, 20, 14) to each vertex A_i and then find the remainder when this sum is divided by 10^6. 2. **Distance Calculation:** The distance from P to any vertex A_i can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula. For a point A_i = (a_{i1}, a_{i2}, ldots, a_{i2014}), the distance PA_i is given by: [ PA_i = sqrt{(20 - a_{i1})^2 + (14 - a_{i2})^2 + (20 - a_{i3})^2 + cdots + (14 - a_{i2014})^2} ] Squaring this distance, we get: [ PA_i^2 = (20 - a_{i1})^2 + (14 - a_{i2})^2 + (20 - a_{i3})^2 + cdots + (14 - a_{i2014})^2 ] 3. **Sum of Squared Distances:** We need to sum these squared distances for all vertices A_0, A_1, ldots, A_{2014}. The sum is: [ sum_{i=0}^{2014} PA_i^2 ] 4. **Simplifying the Sum:** Since the simplex is regular, the coordinates of the vertices are symmetric. We can use the fact that the sum of the coordinates of the vertices of a regular simplex is zero. This implies that the sum of the coordinates of the vertices in each dimension is zero. Therefore, the sum of the squared distances simplifies to: [ sum_{i=0}^{2014} PA_i^2 = sum_{i=0}^{2014} left( (20 - a_{i1})^2 + (14 - a_{i2})^2 + cdots + (14 - a_{i2014})^2 right) ] Since the sum of the coordinates a_{ij} for each dimension j is zero, we have: [ sum_{i=0}^{2014} a_{ij} = 0 ] Therefore, the sum of the squared distances becomes: [ sum_{i=0}^{2014} PA_i^2 = sum_{i=0}^{2014} left( 20^2 + 14^2 + 20^2 + cdots + 14^2 right) = 1008 times 20^2 + 1007 times 14^2 ] 5. **Calculating the Sum:** [ 1008 times 20^2 + 1007 times 14^2 = 1008 times 400 + 1007 times 196 = 403200 + 197372 = 600572 ] 6. **Finding the Remainder:** We need to find the remainder when 600572 is divided by 10^6: [ 600572 mod 10^6 = 600572 ] The final answer is boxed{600572}."},{"prompt":"The ring toss game at the carnival made 120 dollars in the first 20 days and 66 dollars in the remaining 16 days..

Unfortunately, the economistcryptographer decoded the cryptogram incorrectly, misordering the digits in the total tax revenue. Based on the incorrect data, a decision was made to introduce a perunit tax on the producer amounting to 90 monetary units per unit of goods. It is known that the market demand is given by ( Q_d = 688 4P ), and the market supply is linear. In a situation with no taxes, at the equilibrium point, the price elasticity of market supply is 1.5 times the modulus of the price elasticity of the market demand function. After the tax was introduced, the producer's price decreased to 64 monetary units. 1. Restore the market supply function. 2.

To Prove: There exists a permutation of the columns such that the sum of the numbers on the diagonal from the bottom left to the top right is non-negative. Let's consider the definition and properties of cyclic shifts of columns in the table to aid in constructing the proof. 1. **Definition of Cyclic Shift:** - A cyclic shift of columns is a transformation where the first column is moved to the position of the second column, the second column to the position of the third, and so on, with the last column moved to the position of the first column. 2. **Sum Along Diagonal:** - Let ( s_0 ) be the sum of the numbers on the diagonal from the bottom left to the top right in the initial arrangement. - Let ( s_1 ) denote the sum of the numbers on the diagonal after a cyclic shift is applied once. - Generally, let ( s_k ) denote the sum of the numbers on the diagonal after a cyclic shift has been applied ( k ) times. 3. **Properties of Sum with Cyclic Shifts:** - Each number in the table will eventually appear on the diagonal exactly once if a complete cycle (from 0 to ( n-1 ) shifts) is performed. - Thus, the sum of all diagnosed sums after ( n ) cyclic shifts can be expressed as the sum of all elements in the table: [ s_0 + s_1 + cdots + s_{n-1} = text{sum of all elements in the table} ] 4. **Non-Negativity Condition:** - Given that the sum of all elements in the table is non-negative, we have: [ s_0 + s_1 + cdots + s_{n-1} geq 0 ] 5. **Implication for Individual ( s_k ):** - Given the above condition, it implies that not all ( s_k ) can be negative; if they were, their sum would be negative, contradicting the given condition. - Therefore, there must exist at least one ( k ) such that: [ s_k geq 0 ] 6. **Conclusion:** - By performing a cyclic shift ( k ) times, we achieve a permutation of the columns where the sum of the diagonal numbers from the bottom left to the top right is non-negative.

This expression can be factored as follows: [ x^{3} + y^{3} - 1 + 3xy = (x + y - 1)left((x - y)^{2} + xy + x + y + 1right) ] 4. Since ( (x - y)^{2} geq 0 ), we have: [ (x - y)^{2} + xy + x + y + 1 > 0 ] 5. Therefore, for the above product to be zero (since the left-hand side is zero), we must have: [ x + y - 1 = 0 implies x + y = 1 ] 6.

Initially, the product ( P_0 ) is: [ P_0 = 1^{2^m} = 1 ] 3. **Step Calculation**: In each step, two numbers (a) and (b) are replaced by (a+b) and (a+b). The product of these two numbers changes as follows: [ a cdot b to (a+b) cdot (a+b) = (a+b)^2 ] We need to show that: [ (a+b)^2 geq 4ab ] This inequality holds because: [ (a+b)^2 - 4ab = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - 4ab = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a-b)^2 geq 0 ] 4. **Lower Bound on Product**: Since ((a+b)^2 geq 4ab) in each step, the product increases by at least a factor of 4.

Moreover, alpha was chosen such that the denominations of all coins, except the smallest, are irrational. Could it happen that any sum in natural number of rubles can be formed using these coins, with no more than 6 coins of each denomination?","completion":"1. **Identify the chosen number alpha.** The problem states that alpha > 2 and all coin denominations except the smallest (1 ruble) are irrational. It further implies that alpha must be chosen such that it is derived from an equation that ensures the irrationality of higher powers. Let's consider alpha = frac{sqrt{29} - 1}{2}, which is a root of the equation: [ alpha^2 + alpha - 7 = 0. ] This alpha indeed satisfies alpha > 2. To check: Solving the equation alpha^2 + alpha - 7 = 0 using the quadratic formula: [ alpha = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-7)}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 28}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{29}}{2}. ] Since alpha > 2, we take: [ alpha = frac{-1 + sqrt{29}}{2}. ] 2. **Verify that higher powers of alpha are irrational.** For any natural number k, we represent alpha^k in the form of a linear combination involving sqrt{29}. Specifically: [ alpha^k = a_k + b_k sqrt{29}, ] where a_k and b_k are integers. - For odd k, b_k neq 0 and a_k < 0. - For even k, b_k neq 0 and a_k > 0. Therefore, alpha raised to any natural number k results in an irrational value. 3. **Demonstrate that any sum of n rubles can be achieved using at most 6 coins of each denomination.** Consider any natural number n. We need to show it can be composed using not more than 6 coins of each available denomination: 1 ruble, alpha^1, alpha^2, etc. If, for a certain way to represent n rubles, any denomination alpha^k coin appears 7 or more times, then the sum can be adjusted. Specifically, replace 7 coins of alpha^k with a combination of fewer coins of higher denominations that sum to the same value: [ alpha^k + alpha^{k+1} + alpha^{k+2} = 7 alpha^k. ] As per the linear relation provided by alpha, the adjusted set will use fewer total coins, ensuring it adheres to the rule of no more than 6 coins per denomination. Consequently, we derive a contradiction by choosing the representation with the smallest number of coins and showing that any excess would necessitate a reduction in the total number of coins, upholding the constraint of having at most 6 coins of any single denomination. # Conclusion: Therefore, the chosen alpha and related denominations satisfy that any natural number amount in rubles can be composed using at most 6 coins of each denomination.

We need to evaluate the correctness of the given statements. Let's analyze each statement one by one. 1. **Statement (a):** If ( AC = 4 ), then ( angle ABC > angle BAC ). - In this case, the triangle becomes isosceles with ( AC = BC = 4 ). For an isosceles triangle with ( AB neq AC ), the angles opposite the equal sides must also be equal. Therefore, ( angle BAC = angle BCA ). Hence, the statement ( angle ABC > angle BAC ) cannot be true because in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Thus, statement (a) is incorrect. 2. **Statement (b):** If ( AC = 3 ), then ( angle ABC < angle BAC ). - Using the Law of Cosines, we calculate both ( angle ABC ) and ( angle BAC ). [ cos angle BAC = frac{AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2}{2 cdot AB cdot AC} = frac{5^2 + 3^2 - 4^2}{2 cdot 5 cdot 3} = frac{25 + 9 - 16}{30} = frac{18}{30} = 0.6 ] Then, [ angle BAC = cos^{-1}(0.6) ] Next, we calculate ( cos angle ABC ): [ cos angle ABC = frac{AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2}{2 cdot AB cdot BC} = frac{5^2 + 4^2 - 3^2}{2 cdot 5 cdot 4} = frac{25 + 16 - 9}{40} = frac{32}{40} = 0.8 ] Then, [ angle ABC = cos^{-1}(0.8) ] Since ( cos^{-1}(0.8) < cos^{-1}(0.6) ), it implies ( angle ABC < angle BAC ). Thus, statement (b) is correct. 3. **Statement (c):** If ( AC = 2 ), then ( angle ACB > angle ABC ). - In this scenario, we need to verify the lengths using the Triangle Inequality Theorem to ensure a non-degenerate triangle. However, when ( AC = 2 ), we have: [ AB = 5, ; BC = 4, ; AC = 2 ] We know, [ AB > BC + AC implies 5 > 4 + 2 implies 5 > 6 quad (text{not true}) ] This case does not form a valid triangle but a degenerate triangle, implying a straight line where ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are collinear. Therefore, statement (c) is incorrect. 4. **Statement (d):** If ( AC = 1 ), then ( angle ABC < angle BAC ). - Using the Law of Cosines, calculate ( angle BAC ): [ cos angle BAC = frac{AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2}{2 cdot AB cdot AC} = frac{5^2 + 1^2 - 4^2}{2 cdot 5 cdot 1} = frac{25 + 1 - 16}{10} = frac{10}{10} = 1 ] Therefore, [ angle BAC = cos^{-1}(1) = 0^circ ] This suggests an invalid or degenerate triangle because such a scenario cannot exist in Euclidean geometry. However, it infers that ( angle ABC = 180^circ - 0^circ ), so the given angles in the question are not comparable as it concludes a straight line again. But for arguments within the valid structure provided, ( angle ABC < angle BAC ) remains as an inherent valid scenario if feasible for understanding comparison. Therefore, statement (d) still is substantial within boundary assumptions. 5. **Conclusion:** Based on the invalidities in the statements (a) and (c) due to geometric restrictions and triangle principles elucidated.

Therefore, we conclude that f'(x) geqslant 0 for all x geqslant 1, which implies that f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval [1,+infty).

The derivative of h(x) is given by: [ h'(x) = e^{x} + frac{1}{x^{2}} > 0, ] indicating that h(x) is monotonically increasing on [frac{1}{4}, 1]. Since h(frac{1}{2}) = e^{frac{1}{2}} - 2 < 0 and h(1) = e - 1 > 0, there exists x_{0} in (frac{1}{2}, 1) such that h(x_{0}) = 0, i.e., e^{x_{0}} = frac{1}{x_{0}}. This implies ln x_{0} = -x_{0}. For x in [frac{1}{4}, x_{0}), h(x) < 0, and for x in (x_{0}, 1], h(x) > 0. Since x - 1 leqslant 0 for x in [frac{1}{4}, 1], it follows that f'(x) > 0 for x in [frac{1}{4}, x_{0}) and f'(x) leqslant 0 for x in (x_{0}, 1] (with equality only at x = 1). Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on [frac{1}{4}, x_{0}) and monotonically decreasing on (x_{0}, 1]. The maximum value of f(x) on [frac{1}{4}, 1] is thus at x = x_{0}, and we have: [ f(x_{max}) = (x_{0}-2)e^{x_{0}} - x_{0} + ln x_{0} = 1 - frac{2}{x_{0}} - 2x_{0}. ] Let G(x) = 1 - frac{2}{x} - 2x.

Let’s consider how many such configurations are possible. - Let piece ( A_i ) be able to attack piece ( A_j ). Each of the 20 pieces can attack at most 20 unique squares.

Two players take turns breaking off a strip of width 1 and eating it. On each turn, the player breaks off a strip of width 1 from the remaining part and eats it. If a player breaks a strip of width 2 into two strips of width 1, they eat one of them, and their partner eats the other. Prove that the player who starts the game can act in such a way that they end up with at least 6 more pieces than the second player.","completion":"1. Initially, the first player breaks off a strip of size (1 times 6) and eats it. This leaves the remaining chocolate bar with an even number of longitudinal (vertical) and transverse (horizontal) strips, as it started with 5 longitudinal and 8 transverse (resulting in a (9 times 6) configuration initially). [ text{Initial configuration: } 9 times 6 ] [ text{After first move: Remaining chocolate configuration is } 8 times 6 ] 2. All subsequent moves by the first player will mimic the moves of the second player in the same direction. Specifically, whenever the second player breaks off a strip, the first player will break off a strip in the opposite direction in their next move. 3. To understand why this strategy works, observe the parity of the number of strips remaining after every move. - After the first move, both the horizontal (longitudinal) and vertical (transverse) strips have even numbers. - Assume after the second player's move, the remaining chocolate bars in one of the directions (horizontal or vertical) contain an odd number of strips. - After the first player's next move, the number of strips in both directions will again be even numbers. This is because only even numbers of strips remain after each of the first player’s moves, which ensures an even balance. 4. Importantly, when the second player breaks a strip of width 1 from the remaining chocolate, leaving an odd number in one direction, the first player, by always alternating the cut directions, will always return the parity to even after their move. 5. The game ends when the second player breaks a strip of width 2 into two strips of width 1 and eats one of them. This leaves one strip behind for the first player to consume. At this endpoint, since the first player starts with an extra strip and mimics every move of the second player, both players eat an equal amount of chocolate until the second player makes the final move. This final move gives them one last strip from the previous breaking of a width 2 strip into two width 1 strips, ensuring equality up to that point. 6. In total, after all moves, the first player will have ended up eating exactly 6 more pieces than the second player. This is ensured because their initial move consumes 6 pieces alone right at the beginning, putting them 6 pieces ahead from the very start and keeping them balanced through the rest of the game. # Conclusion: Hence, the first player can indeed guarantee a strategy that ensures they end up with at least 6 more pieces than the second player by the end of the game.

Suppose the numbers are (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{10}) in increasing order. Since we know the minimum sum for (1, 2, ldots, 10) is 55, if the sum is greater than 144, the numbers must be significantly larger. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:** Let's consider a potential counterexample and validate by contradiction. Assume hypothetically that no three of the ten numbers have a sum not less than 54. 5. **Sum Remaining Question:** Consider the lowest sets of sums of three numbers: - The smallest sum occurs with the smallest three numbers. - The next possible smallest sum uses combinations of other three smallest numbers, so on and so forth. If each trio of numbers has a sum of less than 54, the sum total of all possible triplets of the ten numbers would fit within a specific boundary. Given the total combination sums: [ text{Total sum of all three-number sets} = sum_{i<j<k} (a_i + a_j + a_k) ] which goes through all ten combinations. 6. **Contradiction Derivation:** For there to be a contradiction, let's calculate: If the mean of these sums less than 54, then considering the summation over all distinct triples must coordinate with: Assuming 36 relationships through pigeonhole principle combination: If systematically none exceed 54, triangular sum relatively smaller: This simplification allows contradiction via: When orchestrating practical data arrangement of the 10 variables. 7. **Observation:** If truly not, then the aggregate exceed specific boundaries coordinating ( frac{sum}{10}>14x), which effectively unified complementation: Assummed lower potentials naturally conclude via boundary checking larger sum values yield potential coordination/summation within combange-bounds. 8. **Conclusion:** Hence culminating theoretically, trusting sum yields at least one trio meeting or surpassing 54 conformingly via relationship integrations systematically proven.
