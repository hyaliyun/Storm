The vertex of this parabola is at (2, h), which means the highest point on the graph is at x=2. 2. Point A has coordinates left(-frac{1}{2}, y_{1}right).

Let's break down the solution step by step. # Step 1: Analyzing the Linear Function The linear function given is y=(a-1)x+a-8. For the graph of this function to pass through the first, third, and fourth quadrants, we need to ensure two conditions are met: 1. The slope of the line, a-1, must be positive. This is because a positive slope indicates the line goes upwards as it moves from left to right, which is necessary for it to pass through the specified quadrants. 2. The y-intercept, a-8, must be negative. This ensures that the line crosses the y-axis below the origin, which is again necessary for it to pass through the specified quadrants. Mathematically, these conditions can be expressed as: - a-1 > 0 Rightarrow a > 1 - a-8 < 0 Rightarrow a < 8 Combining these, we get the first range for a as: [1 < a < 8] # Step 2: Solving the Fractional Equation Given the fractional equation frac{y-5}{1-y}+3=frac{a}{y-1}, we aim to solve it in terms of y. To eliminate the denominators, we can multiply through by (1-y), which gives us: [y-5+3(1-y)=-a] Simplifying this, we find: [y-5+3-3y=-a] [-2y=-a+2] [y=frac{a-2}{2}] # Step 3: Applying the Condition on the Solution The condition that the solution of the fractional equation is greater than -3 can now be applied to our expression for y: [frac{a-2}{2} > -3] Solving for a, we get: [a-2 > -6] [a > -4] Additionally, we must ensure that y neq 1 to avoid division by zero in the original equation.

The weight of the lightest weight and the heaviest weight differ by 9 grams. One of these weights is missing, and the total weight of the remaining weights is 2022 grams. We need to find the weight of the missing weight. 1. Let ( x ) be the weight of the lightest weight. The weights can therefore be represented as ( x, x+1, x+2, ldots, x+9 ) since there are 10 different weights with a difference of 9 grams. 2. The weight of the missing weight is denoted as ( x + y ) where ( 0 < y < 9 ). 3. The total weight of all 10 weights can be calculated using the sum of an arithmetic series: [ text{Sum} = x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + cdots + (x + 9) ] 4. This simplifies to: [ text{Sum} = sum_{i=0}^{9} (x + i) = 10x + (0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + 9) ] 5. The sum of the first 9 natural numbers is ( frac{9 cdot 10}{2} = 45 ).

Let (G^*) be a graph such that (m(G^*)=m_0). Show that there exists a way to color the edges of (G^*) using 4 colors, such that no monochromatic triangle (a triangle where all three edges are the same color) is formed.","completion":"1. **Problem Understanding and Setup**: We are given a set ( P = {P_1, P_2, cdots, P_{1994}} ) of 1994 points in a plane such that no three points are collinear. These points need to be partitioned into 83 groups, each containing at least 3 points. Once partitioned, every two points within the same group will be connected by a line segment, forming a graph ( G ). Our goal is to minimize the number of triangles ( m(G) ) formed in this graph and subsequently prove that there exists a coloring scheme using 4 colors in such a way that no monochromatic triangle forms in ( G^* ), the graph with the minimum number of triangles ( m_0 ). 2. **Mathematical Formulation**: Let's denote the partition groups by ( X_1, X_2, cdots, X_{83} ), where ( X_i ) represents the set of points in group ( i ) and ( x_i = |X_i| ). Thus, the sum of the sizes of all groups equals the total number of points: [ x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_{83} = 1994 ] The number of triangles in ( G ) for this partition is given by: [ m(G) = sum_{i=1}^{83} binom{x_i}{3} ] 3. **Minimization by Balancing Group Sizes**: If we assume there exist two groups ( X_i ) and ( X_j ) with sizes such that ( |x_i - x_j| geq 2 ), suppose ( x_i > x_j ). By redistributing one point from ( X_i ) to ( X_j ) (decreasing ( x_i ) by 1 and increasing ( x_j ) by 1), we form a new graph ( G' ) and can show that this operation decreases the total number of triangles: [ m_0 = sum_{i=1}^{83} binom{x_i}{3} ] Reducing this difference lowers the total number of triangles: [ begin{aligned} m_0 - m_1 &= binom{x_i}{3} + binom{x_j}{3} - binom{x_i-1}{3} - binom{x_j+1}{3} &= frac{1}{6} [x_i(x_i-1)(x_i-2) + x_j(x_j-1)(x_j-2) - (x_i-1)(x_i-2)(x_i-3) - (x_j+1)x_j(x_j-1)] &= frac{1}{2} [(x_i-1)(x_i-2) - x_j(x_j-1)] > 0, end{aligned} ] showing that a balanced partition minimizes the number of triangles. 4. **Deriving the Minimum Number**: For 1994 points divided into 83 groups as evenly as possible, we consider: [ 1994 = 83 times 24 + 2 = 81 times 24 + 2 times 25 ] Hence, 81 groups will have 24 points each and 2 groups will have 25 points each: [ m_0 = 81 binom{24}{3} + 2 binom{25}{3} ] Calculating binomial coefficients: [ binom{24}{3} = frac{24 cdot 23 cdot 22}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 2024 ] [ binom{25}{3} = frac{25 cdot 24 cdot 23}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 2300 ] Thus, [ m_0 = 81 times 2024 + 2 times 2300 = 168544 ] 5. **Finding Coloring Scheme**: For graph ( G^* ) with minimum triangles, use exactly 4 colors to color the edges such that no single-color triangle exists. Divide each group, say those with 25 points, into five groups of 5: [ X_1 = M_1 cup M_2 cup M_3 cup M_4 cup M_5 ] where ( |M_i| = 5 ). Color each edge in group ( X_1 ) with different colors ensuring the groups don't form monochromatic triangles.

Suppose d > 100. Consider integers in the interval ([a + 100^2, a + 100^2 + 100]).

The goal is to show that the variance of the random variable X is bounded by the square of half the difference between its maximum and minimum values, specifically: [ D(X) leq [(b - a) / 2]^2. ] 2.

The maximum possible value for Y is (b - a) / 2 so: [ Mleft[Y^2right] leq left(frac{b - a}{2}right)^2, ] because the expectation of Y^2 cannot exceed the square of its maximum possible deviation value. 8.

The length of each altitude is calculated as follows: [ text{Altitude} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times text{Side Length} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} times 2 = sqrt{3} ] 3.

Let these roots be ( a ) and ( b ).

We need to show that all such circles pass through a common point. 4. **Using the Power of a Point theorem:** According to the Power of a Point theorem, for a point ( P ) outside a circle, the power of the point is the product of the lengths of the segments of any line through ( P ) that intersects the circle. For the point ( (0, 1) ), we need to show that the power of this point with respect to the circle is the same for all such circles. 5. **Calculate the power of the point ( (0, 1) ):** The power of the point ( (0, 1) ) with respect to the circle passing through ( (a, 0) ), ( (b, 0) ), and ( (0, q) ) is given by: [ text{Power} = (0 - a)(0 - b) - (1 - 0)(1 - q) ] Simplifying, we get: [ text{Power} = ab - (1 - q) ] 6. **Relate the roots to the coefficients:** From the quadratic equation ( x^2 + px + q = 0 ), we know that the product of the roots ( a ) and ( b ) is given by: [ ab = q ] 7. **Substitute ( ab = q ) into the power equation:** [ text{Power} = q - (1 - q) = q - 1 + q = 2q - 1 ] 8. **Verify the power of the point ( (0, 1) ):** For the point ( (0, 1) ) to lie on the circle, the power must be zero: [ 2q - 1 = 0 implies q = frac{1}{2} ] 9. **Conclusion:** Since ( q ) is not necessarily ( frac{1}{2} ) for all parabolas, we need to re-evaluate our approach.

Recall that two triangles are congruent if and only if their corresponding sides and angles are equal. [Delta ABC cong Delta DEF] 2. When two triangles are congruent, each side of one triangle has a corresponding side in the other triangle that is of equal length. This means that the sides (a, b,) and (c) of triangle ( Delta ABC ) must correspond to the sides (d, e,) and (f) of triangle ( Delta DEF ). 3. However, the problem specifies that none of the sides (a, b, c) of triangle (Delta ABC) are equal to the sides (d, e, f) of triangle (Delta DEF) directly, i.e., (a neq d), (b neq e), (c neq f). 4. This seems contradictory at first, but the key is understanding that each side in one triangle corresponds to a side of equal length in the other triangle, without necessarily having the same label. 5. For the triangles to be congruent, their sides must be in a one-to-one correspondence, but the correspondence might not be (a = d), (b = e), (c = f). Instead, it could be some permutation of these sides. 6. For instance, it could be that (a) corresponds to (e), (b) corresponds to (f), and (c) corresponds to (d).

This implies that when x < 0, f(x) is increasing, while g(x) is decreasing. We can use the properties of odd and even functions to deduce the behavior for x > 0.

We need to reconsider the arrangement or use Euler's formula for polyhedra, V - E + F = 2, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces. Given F = 12 + 8 + 6 = 26, and assuming each edge is shared by two faces, we can estimate E and solve for V. However, without additional information, we proceed with the assumption that each vertex is counted once per face type, leading to 48 vertices. 2. **Calculate the total number of segments**: Each vertex can connect to any other vertex forming a segment. The total number of ways to choose 2 vertices from 48 is given by the combination formula binom{48}{2} = frac{48 times 47}{2} = 1128. 3. **Exclude segments along edges or faces**: - Each vertex connects to 3 other vertices on the same square, 5 on the same hexagon, and 7 on the same octagon. - However, each vertex is shared between a square, hexagon, and octagon, so we need to exclude the shared vertices to avoid double-counting. Each vertex shares 1 vertex with each adjacent face type (square-hexagon, square-octagon, hexagon-octagon). - Total vertices to exclude per vertex = (3 + 5 + 7) - 3 = 12. Thus, the number of segments that do not lie along an edge or face from one vertex is 47 - 12 = 35. Multiplying by the total number of vertices and dividing by 2 to account for double-counting (since a segment from A to B is the same as from B to A), we get: [ frac{48 times 35}{2} = 840 ] 4. **Conclusion**: The number of segments joining vertices of the polyhedron that lie in the interior of the polyhedron rather than along an edge or a face is boxed{840}."},{"prompt":"What is the simplified value of frac{5}{9}daggerfrac{4}{6}, if the operation dagger is defined as frac{m}{n}daggerfrac{p}{q} = (m^2)(p)(frac{q}{n})?","completion":"Given the definition frac{m}{n}daggerfrac{p}{q} = (m^2)(p)(frac{q}{n}), we apply this to frac{5}{9}daggerfrac{4}{6}: 1.

This means that the amount of work x did in 8 days plus the amount of work y did in 28 days equals the total work. Let's assume the total work is 1 unit. The work done by x in one day is 1/D_x and by y is 1/D_y. The work done by x in 8 days is 8/D_x and the work done by y in 28 days is 28/D_y. Since the total work is completed when both have worked, we can write the equation: 8/D_x + 28/D_y = 1 We know D_y = 35, so we can substitute that into the equation: 8/D_x + 28/35 = 1 Now, we simplify the second term: 8/D_x + 4/5 = 1 Subtract 4/5 from both sides to isolate the term with D_x: 8/D_x = 1 - 4/5 8/D_x = 1/5 Now, we solve for D_x: D_x = 8 / (1/5) D_x = 8 * 5 D_x = 40 So, x takes boxed{40} days to complete the work."},{"prompt":"The contact points of the inscribed circle in triangle ( ABC ) on its sides are ( A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1} ).

Therefore, we can construct a square using pieces of A. Since tiling a square with rectangles is easier due to the nature of rational dimensions, we can use these squares to construct a larger rectangle similar to B. Thus, by repeatedly tiling with A, we can indeed fill a rectangle similar to B with copies of A. This works because the rational ratio allows for a periodic and consistent tiling pattern. # Conclusion If a rectangle similar to A can be tiled with copies of B, then under both considerations of rationality and irrationality, a rectangle similar to B can be tiled with copies of A, as shown through logical deducements and tiling arguments.

If we intersect this cylinder with a plane inclined at an angle (alpha) to the base of the cylinder, the intersection curve on the lateral surface of the cylinder must be determined. 2. **Mapping the Cylindrical Surface:** When we unfold the lateral surface of the cylinder to a plane, we map it to a rectangle with width equal to the circumference of the base of the cylinder, which is ( 2pi R ), and height ( H ). Let's define a coordinate system where the ( x )-axis corresponds to the horizontal distance along the unwrapped cylinder, and the ( y )-axis corresponds to the vertical distance. 3. **Equation of the Inclined Plane:** The inclined plane intersects the cylinder such that in cylindrical coordinates ( (r, theta, z) ): [ z = rcot(alpha) sin(theta) + z_{0} ] where ( z_0 ) is some constant height offset. 4. **Transformation to Cartesian Coordinates:** When unwrapping the cylinder, ( theta ) translates to ( x ) according to: [ x = Rtheta ] Hence, the coordinates transform to ( (Rtheta, z) ). The transformed equation of the intersection line becomes: [ z = R cot(alpha) sinleft(frac{x}{R}right) + z_0 ] 5. **Simplification:** Since ( R cot(alpha) ) is a constant, let it be ( A ): [ z = A sinleft(frac{x}{R}right) + z_0 ] This equation represents the sinusoidal form of the section line in the ( (x, z) )-plane after the cylindrical surface is unwrapped. 6. **Conclusion:** Thus, the intersection of the cylinder with the inclined plane, when unrolled, forms a sinusoidal curve: [ z = A sinleft(frac{x}{R}right) + z_0 ] Hence, by proving the transformation of coordinates, we validate that the intersection line follows sinusoidal behavior when the surface is developed into a plane.

These cuts will map to parallel lines running across the entire larger square. 5. **Counting the Parts**: - Each vertical cut through the midpoint of the (1 times 1) squares will logically create (9) equally spaced vertical sections (the additional sections generated by cutting across the lines). 6. **Conclusion**: - Since cutting through all layers simultaneously separates the entire square into (9) vertical strips, these strips represent the number of parts the initial (8 times 8) square breaks into when unfolded.

Given that each side is 150 sqft, this seems to be a mistake because \\"sqft\\" stands for square feet, which is a unit of area, not length. Assuming that each side is actually 150 feet in length, we can calculate the perimeter as follows: Perimeter of the square = 4 × side length Perimeter = 4 × 150 feet Perimeter = 600 feet Now, if a pole is laid every 30 feet, we can calculate the number of poles needed by dividing the perimeter by the distance between poles: Number of poles = Perimeter / Distance between poles Number of poles = 600 feet / 30 feet Number of poles = 20 However, since we are fencing a square, we need to ensure that there is a pole at each corner. When we place poles every 30 feet, we will have poles at the corners, but we need to check if the last pole on each side coincides with the corner pole or not.

The projection of O onto any plane containing the height of the pyramid forms another square, with O remaining equidistant from the vertices.

This assumption allows us to express the equation in terms of a perfect square: [ 2^n + 2^{2k} = a^2 ] where ( a ) is a natural number. 3. Factor out ( 2^{2k} ) from the left-hand side: [ 2^n + 2^{2k} = 2^{2k}(2^{n-2k} + 1) = a^2 ] 4. Since the right-hand side is a perfect square, and ( 2^{2k} ) is also a perfect square, then ( 2^{n-2k} + 1 ) must also be a perfect square: [ 2^{n-2k} + 1 = b^2 ] where ( b ) is a natural number. 5.

Therefore, ( k leq 13 ). 2. **Verify if ( k = 13 ) is possible:** - Consider the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 11, 12, 22} ). The sum of these numbers is: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 11 + 12 + 22 = frac{11 cdot 12}{2} + 12 + 22 = 66 + 12 + 22 = 100 ] This satisfies the condition of having 100 stones. Additionally, any partition of one of these piles into two smaller piles will result in at least two piles having the same number of stones. Therefore, ( k = 13 ) is possible. 3. **Verify if ( k = 10 ) is possible:** - Consider the set ( {1, 3, 5, ldots, 19} ). The sum of these numbers is: [ 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 100 ] This satisfies the condition of having 100 stones.

Therefore, ( k = 10 ) is possible. 4. **Show that ( k < 10 ) does not work:** - Suppose there is no 1-stone pile. If there is a pile with ( n ) stones, there must be one with ( n-1 ) stones because ( n = (n-1) + 1 ). Therefore, if ( n ) is the number of stones in the biggest pile, the total number of stones is: [ n + (n-1) + ldots + 2 = frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 ] This cannot be 100. Hence, there must be a pile with just 1 stone. 5. **Analyze the case when the biggest pile has ( 2m+1 ) stones:** - At least one of the pairs ( (1, 2m), (2, 2m-1), ldots, (m, m+1) ) must be present. Therefore, there are at least ( m+1 ) piles in total. 6. **Analyze the case when the biggest pile has ( 2m ) stones:** - There are at least ( m ) piles. 7. **Show that ( k leq 8 ) does not work:** - If ( k leq 8 ), the biggest pile has at most ( 2k = 16 ) stones. The total number of stones is: [ 1 + 16 + 15 + ldots + 10 = 92 < 100 ] This is a contradiction. Therefore, ( k geq 9 ). 8. **Analyze the case when ( k = 9 ):** - The biggest pile has at most 18 stones. Consider the smallest pile greater than 10. By the previous analysis, there are at least 5 piles less than or equal to 10. If the biggest pile has 17 or fewer stones, the total number of stones is: [ 1 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 = 97 < 100 ] This is a contradiction. Therefore, the biggest pile must have 18 stones. However, the smallest pile greater than 1 can be at most 4.

However, the standard solution states this as incorrect, likely due to a misunderstanding. The correct interpretation should be that if a - b + c = 0, then x = -1 is a root, but the solution mistakenly states ① as incorrect. # Statement ②: If the equation ax^{2}+c=0 has two distinct real roots, then the equation ax^{2}+bx+c=0left(aneq 0right) must have two distinct real roots. - For ax^2 + c = 0 to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant must be greater than 0, which means 0 - 4ac < 0 Rightarrow ac > 0. - For ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is b^2 - 4ac.

Let's follow the steps to check this hypothesis. 1. **Vertex Edge Intersections:** Assume at a vertex A of the polyhedron, an even number m of edges meet. The plane cuts across these edges. If we consider a parallel plane that starts and passes through A, it slices through an m-gon that detaches vertex A from the rest of the polyhedron. By design, m is even, as each time we move the plane through a vertex, the number of intersected edges changes. 2. **Family of Parallel Sections:** Take a plane pi and consider a family of planes parallel to it, each cutting through no more than one vertex of the polyhedron at a time. As the plane (pi) slides through the polyhedron, the number of sides intersected (i.e., forming the cross-section) changes only when the plane crosses a vertex. 3. **Parity Change:** Let's examine the change in the number of sides of a cross-section as the plane moves through a vertex where k edges intersect (with k being odd by design). If before crossing, the plane intersects s of the k edges, then after crossing it intersects s-k edges. Here, since k is odd: - Before crossing: Plane intersects s edges. - After crossing: Plane intersects s - k edges. Since s and k are integers and k is odd: [ s - k text{ (as an integer)} quad(text{odd} - text{odd}) = text{even - odd} = text{odd or even} ] 4. **Odd Section Invariance Contradiction:** If we started with a polygon of the number of sides n (an odd number as per hypothesis), after crossing a vertex, the resulting number of sides must be either n + 1 - 2k (even number), generating a polygon with an even number of sides. This presents a contradiction, as it implies a shifted plane developed an even-sided polygon. Therefore, our assumption that a convex polyhedron exists such that any section by a plane not passing through a vertex forms a polygon with odd sides is proven wrong due to resulting in sections with even sides occasionally. # Conclusion: There is no such convex polyhedron where every plane section that doesn't pass through a vertex forms a polygon with an odd number of sides. boxed{text{Not exist}}"},{"prompt":"Find the largest positive integer n for which n! can be expressed as the product of n 5 consecutive positive integers.","completion":"The product of n - 5 consecutive integers can be represented as frac{(n - 5 + b)!}{b!} for some integer b.

Therefore, any section of the cube by a plane passing through its center is a centrally symmetric polygon, having no more than six sides. 2. **Cube Rotation Around Diagonal**: When a cube is rotated around its diagonal by 120^circ, 240^circ, and 360^circ, it maps onto itself. This is because the diagonal of the cube is an axis of symmetry of order three (i.e., it maps onto itself under these rotations). 3. **Mixin of Symmetry and Sides**: Given that the cube's diagonal is symmetrically positioned relative to each face of the three-faced corner (where it passes through a vertex), the central plane section must map onto itself under rotations of 120^circ and 240^circ. 4. **Polygon Characteristics**: Thus, the section must be a centrally symmetric polygon that maps onto itself when rotated around its center by angles 120^circ and 240^circ. Also, by definition of central symmetry, the polygon also maps onto itself when rotated 180^circ around the center. 5. **Calculation of Additional Rotational Symmetry**: By considering central symmetry and rotational properties, it will also map onto itself under a rotation of 180^circ + 240^circ = 420^circ = 360^circ + 60^circ. Thus, the polygon maps onto itself under rotations by 60^circ, 120^circ, 180^circ, 240^circ, 300^circ, and 360^circ. This implies that each side of the polygon transitions to other sides in sequence during these rotations, so the number of sides of the polygon must be exactly six (since symmetry makes more sides impossible). 6. **Conclusion**: All sides and angles of this polygon must be equal due to their rotational symmetry, making it a regular hexagon. 7. **Further Implication**: Due to the symmetry of the cube's positioning, such a section must pass through the midpoints of six edges of the cube, which do not run through the cube's diagonal vertices. Thus, the section of the cube by a plane passing through its center and perpendicular to its diagonal is a regular hexagon.

They cannot account for all possible cases of a geometrical figure. - Therefore, reliance on these measurements would lead to conclusions that are only valid within the small margin of error allowed by the measuring instruments. 5. **Proof vs. Empirical Verification**: - Geometrical proofs provide exact and universally valid conclusions through logical reasoning and deductive arguments based on axioms and established theorems. - Instrumental measurements provide empirical verification that can demonstrate a specific case but cannot serve as rigorous proof for all cases. 6. **Conclusion**: - It is impossible to justify general geometrical propositions using instrumental measurements alone because they lack the precision and universality required for rigorous mathematical proofs.

Now we calculate the value of b: b = 5^{-frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{sqrt{5}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}. Since sqrt{5} is slightly greater than 2 but less than 3, this means b = frac{sqrt{5}}{5} < frac{1}{2}.

Since points P and Q are symmetric with respect to the origin and lie on the ellipse, and the distance |PQ| equals the distance between the foci |F_1F_2|, we can deduce that the quadrilateral PF_1QF_2 forms a rectangle. This is because the only way for P and Q to be symmetric and for |PQ| to equal |F_1F_2| while all points lie on or within the ellipse is if P and Q are at the ends of the minor axis. Let's denote |PF_1| = m and |PF_2| = n.

We can square both sides to facilitate further calculations, yielding m^2 + 2mn + n^2 = 64. This equation represents the square of the sum of the distances. Given that the distance between the foci |F_1F_2| = 2c, and using the relationship c^2 = a^2 - b^2, we find that |F_1F_2|^2 = 4c^2 = 4(a^2 - b^2).

Therefore, without specifying that the three points must be non-collinear, statement A is too general and can be incorrect. - **Statement B**: A line consists of infinitely many points extending in two directions. When you add a point that is not on this line, it ensures that we are not dealing with a collinear situation. This configuration will always determine a unique plane because there is only one plane that can contain both the line and the point outside it.

This does not uniquely determine a plane since there are infinitely many planes that can contain this line.

The total number of arrangements is the product of the permutations within each group and the arrangement of groups: [ 7! times (6! times 5! times 2!) ] Calculating the factorial values: - 7! = 5040 - 6! = 720 - 5! = 120 - 2! = 2 Then, the total number of arrangements is: [ 5040 times (720 times 120 times 2) = 5040 times 172800 = 871,219,200 ] Thus, the total number of ways Mr. Reader can arrange his comic books into these stacks is boxed{871,219,200}."},{"prompt":"Let x_1, x_2, x_3, dots, x_{50} be positive real numbers such that x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + dots + x_{50}^2 = 2.

We can eliminate 1 point and check the remaining configurations, each leading to the conclusion that a square's vertices must be present. 2. **Considering a larger subset of 12 points:** If we consider the first three columns of the 4x4 grid, i.e., points ((i, j)) where (0 leqslant i leqslant 3) and (0 leqslant j leqslant 2), any selection of 9 points out of these 12 must include four points forming a square: - **Reasoning:** If we exclude 3 points out of these 12, at least one excluded point will be from the first or last column as selecting 9 necessitates removing points from the middle to avoid a square since excluding only from sides would still not avoid the formation of a square, confirming at least one square exists. 3. **General Argument:** Removing any 5 points from the 16 does not avoid the formation of at least one square: - By symmetry and repetitions, whether points are removed from edges or the middle, the remaining will always ensure that at least one set of vertices form a square.

Solution: (1) Let the standard equation of the ellipse E be frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > b > 0), From |PF_1| + |PF_2| = 4, we get 2a = 4, therefore a = 2, Since point P(1,frac{3}{2}) is on the ellipse, therefore frac{1}{4} + frac{9}{4b^2} = 1 therefore b = sqrt{3}, The standard equation of the ellipse E is frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1; (2) According to the problem, quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram, therefore S_{ABCD} = 4S_{Delta OAB}, Let the equation of line AB be x = my - 1, and A(x_1,y_1), B(x_2,y_2), From begin{cases} x = my - 1 frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1 end{cases}, we get (3m^2 + 4)y^2 - 6my - 9 = 0, therefore y_1 + y_2 = frac{6m}{3m^2 + 4}, y_1y_2 = -frac{9}{3m^2 + 4}, S_{Delta OAB} = S_{Delta OF_1A} + S_{Delta OF_1B} = frac{1}{2} |OF_1| cdot |y_1 - y_2| = frac{1}{2} |y_1 - y_2|, = frac{1}{2} sqrt{(y_1 + y_2)^2 - 4y_1y_2} = 6sqrt{frac{m^2 + 1}{(3m^2 + 4)^2}}, Let m^2 + 1 = t, then t geqslant 1, S_{Delta OAB} = 6sqrt{frac{t}{(3t + 1)^2}} = 6sqrt{frac{1}{9t + frac{1}{t} + 6}}, Since g(t) = 9t + frac{1}{t} is monotonically increasing on [1,+infty), therefore g(t) geqslant g(1) = 10, therefore the maximum value of S_{Delta OAB} is frac{3}{2}, so the maximum value of S_{ABCD} is boxed{6}. B. Solution: (1) The domain of the function f(x) is (0,+infty), f'(x) = frac{a(1-ln x)}{x^2}, Since the equation of the tangent line to the graph of the function at point (1,f(1)) is y = x - 1, So begin{cases} f'(1) = a = 1, f(1) = frac{aln 1}{1} + b = 0, end{cases}, Solving, we get a = 1, b = 0. Therefore, f(x) = frac{ln x}{x}, so f'(x) = frac{1-ln x}{x^2}. Let f'(x) = 0, we get x = e, When 0 < x < e, f'(x) > 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing, When x > e, f'(x) < 0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing. Therefore, the monotonic increasing interval of the function f(x) is (0,e), and the monotonic decreasing interval is (e,+infty). (2) When f(x_1) = f(x_2) (x_1 neq x_2), x_1 + x_2 > 2e. Proof: Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing for x > e and f(x) = frac{ln x}{x} > 0, And f(1) = 0, when 1 < x < e, f(x) is monotonically increasing and f(x) > 0. If f(x_1) = f(x_2) (x_1 neq x_2), then both x_1, x_2 must be greater than 1, and one must be less than e and the other greater than e. Assume 1 < x_1 < e < x_2, when x_2 geqslant 2e, it must be that x_1 + x_2 > 2e. When e < x_2 < 2e, f(x_1) - f(2e - x_2) = f(x_2) - f(2e - x_2) = frac{ln x_2}{x_2} - frac{ln (2e - x_2)}{2e - x_2}, Let g(x) = frac{ln x}{x} - frac{ln (2e - x)}{2e - x}, e < x < 2e, Then g'(x) = frac{1-ln x}{x^2} - frac{-1+ln (2e - x)}{(2e - x)^2} = frac{4e(e - x)(1-ln x) - x^2ln (-x^2 + 2ex) + 2x^2}{x^2(2e - x)^2} = frac{4e(e - x)(1-ln x) + x^2{2-ln [- (x - e)^2 + e^2]}}{x^2(2e - x)^2}. Since e < x < 2e, e^2 - (x - e)^2 in (0,e^2), so 2-ln [-(x - e)^2 + e^2] > 0. And 4e(e - x)(1-ln x) > 0, so g'(x) > 0. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval (e,2e). So g(x) > g(e) = frac{1}{e} - frac{1}{e} = 0. Therefore, f(x_1) > f(2e - x_2). Since 1 < x_1 < e and e < x_2 < 2e, so 0 < 2e - x_2 < e, And since f(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval (0,e), so x_1 > 2e - x_2, i.e., x_1 + x_2 > 2e.

This means that in 0.7407 hours, the train covers a distance of: Distance covered = Effective speed * Effective time moving Distance covered = 40 kmph * 0.7407 hours Now, the actual speed of the train excluding stoppages (S) would cover this same distance in 1 hour (since we are looking for the speed per hour). Therefore, we can set up the equation: S kmph * 1 hour = 40 kmph * 0.7407 hours Solving for S: S = 40 kmph * 0.7407 S = 29.628 kmph Therefore, the speed of the train excluding stoppages is approximately boxed{29.63} kmph."},{"prompt":"A line passing through the point (0, 1) intersects the hyperbola x^2y^2=1 at exactly one point.

If proposition q is true (the function y=f(x) is a monotonic function), then it implies proposition p must be true (the function y=f(x) is not an even function). This is because a function can be even and monotonic, for instance, f(x)=|x| is even and monotonic. However, for a function to be even, it does not necessarily have to be monotonic; a counterexample can be provided. Let's take the function f(x) = (x - 1)^2 as an example. This function is not even because f(-x) = (-x - 1)^2 neq (x - 1)^2 = f(x). However, this function is not monotonic over the entire real line mathbb{R}, as it has a minimum at x = 1 and increases on both sides from this point.

This implies: 1. a + b > c 2. a + c > b 3. b + c > a From these inequalities, we can deduce the sign of each expression inside the absolute value functions: - For a-b-c, we rearrange the third inequality to get b+c-a>0, which implies a-b-c<0. - Similarly, for b-a-c, rearranging the second inequality gives us a+c-b>0, implying b-a-c<0. - For c-a+b, rearranging the first inequality gives us a+b-c>0, which means c-a+b>0.

For the number to be as large as possible, we aim for the hundreds digit to be 9, the largest digit possible. This approach ensures that any number we find will be larger than any number with a hundreds digit less than 9. Next, we consider the common ratio r of the geometric sequence. To keep the digits distinct and maximize the size of the other digits, we want the common ratio to be as small as possible. This is because the ones digit is determined by the formula frac{9}{r^2}, where r is the common ratio. Initially, one might think to choose r=3, leading to a sequence that could give us a number like 931. However, a smaller common ratio would allow for larger digits in the tens and ones places. Thus, we consider r=frac{3}{2}, which is smaller than 3 and still results in distinct digits. Using r=frac{3}{2}, the digits of our number would be 9 for the hundreds place, frac{9}{frac{3}{2}}=6 for the tens place, and frac{9}{(frac{3}{2})^2}=4 for the ones place, forming the number 964. Therefore, the largest three-digit integer whose digits are distinct and form a geometric sequence is boxed{964}.

[ N' = 1 times 10^n + N ] Here: - ( 10^n ) can be written as ( 2^n times text{odd} ) because it is not divisible by ( 2^{n+1} ). - Therefore, ( N' = 2^n times text{odd} + 2^n times text{odd} = 2^n times (text{odd} + text{odd}) ). - Since the sum of two odd numbers is even, ( text{odd} + text{odd} ) is even, and thus ( N' ) is divisible by an additional factor of 2. - Consequently, ( N' ) is divisible by ( 2(n+1) ). 6. **Conclusion:** - By induction, it is proved that for every ( n ) there exists an ( n )-digit number composed entirely of the digits 1 and 2 which is divisible by ( 2n ).

According to the problem, when N is diminished by x, it is divisible by 8, 14, 26, and 28, and the result is 746. First, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 8, 14, 26, and 28 to determine the number that is divisible by all of them. - The prime factors of 8 are 2^3. - The prime factors of 14 are 2 x 7. - The prime factors of 26 are 2 x 13. - The prime factors of 28 are 2^2 x 7. The LCM of these numbers will be the product of the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in any of the numbers: LCM = 2^3 x 7 x 13 = 8 x 7 x 13 = 56 x 13 = 728. However, 728 is not the LCM we are looking for because 728 is not divisible by 26. We need to include the factor of 13 only once, but we need to include the factor of 2 three times and the factor of 7 at least once to cover all the numbers. The correct LCM should be: LCM = 2^3 x 7 x 13 = 8 x 91 = 728. Now, we know that N - x = 746 and N - x must be a multiple of 728. The smallest number N that satisfies this condition would be the first multiple of 728 that is greater than 746. Since 728 is less than 746, the first multiple of 728 that is greater than 746 is 728 + 746 = 1474. Therefore, the smallest number N is 1474, and the number x by which it is diminished to get a result of 746 is: N - x = 746 1474 - x = 746 x = 1474 - 746 x = 728.

The wizard has 2n cards; for each i = 1, ..., n, there are two cards labeled i. Initially, the wizard places all cards face down in a row, in unknown order. You may repeatedly make moves of the following form: you point to any k of the cards. The wizard then turns those cards face up. If any two of the cards match, the game is over and you win. Otherwise, you must look away, while the wizard arbitrarily permutes the k chosen cards and turns them back facedown. Then, it is your turn again. We say this game is textit{winnable} if there exist some positive integer m and some strategy that is guaranteed to win in at most m moves, no matter how the wizard responds. For which values of n and k is the game winnable?","completion":"Case I: n > k We first prove that the game is winnable whenever n > k by demonstrating a winning strategy in this case. 1. **Strategy Description**: On the i-th move, choose the k cards in positions i through i+k-1. Assuming that you do not win on any earlier move, repeat this for 1 leq i leq 2n-k+1. 2. **Assumption of No Win**: Assume that you did not win on any of the first 2n-k+1 moves, as described above. Let j be an integer such that 1 leq j leq 2n-k. On the j-th move, the wizard revealed the cards in positions j through j+k-1, so you know the labels of all these cards (just not necessarily in the right order). 3. **Overlap Analysis**: Then, on the (j+1)-th move, the wizard revealed the cards in positions j+1 through j+k. This means that you get to see all of the cards that were moved to positions j+1 through j+k. This means that you can uniquely determine the label on card j, since you knew all of the labels from j through j+k-1, and the card in position j could not have moved anywhere else since your last move. 4. **Conclusion of Card Knowledge**: It follows that, after the sequence of 2n-k+1 moves described above, you know the labels on the first 2n-k cards. Since n > k, we have 2n-k geq n+1, so there must be a pair of cards with matching labels in this group of 2n-k cards, by the Pigeonhole Principle. 5. **Winning Move**: On your next move, you can pick a group of k cards that includes that pair of matching cards, and you win. 6. **Final Strategy Evaluation**: We have created a strategy that is guaranteed to win in at most m = 2n-k+2 moves. Thus, the game is winnable for all n > k. boxed{text{The game is winnable for } n > k.} Case II: n = k We now prove that the game is not winnable if n = k. 1. **Initial State Description**: Suppose that the game is in a state S if your knowledge about the card labels is of the following form: There exists a group of n cards for which you know that those n cards have all of the labels 1, 2, ..., n (i.e., you know that they have all distinct labels) in some order, but you know nothing about which of those n cards have which labels. (Call this group of cards Group A). 2. **Analysis of Moves**: - If you pick all of the cards from Group A or all of the cards from Group B (the other n cards), then you clearly will not get a matching pair. The wizard will then arbitrarily permute those cards. - If you pick x cards from Group A and n-x cards from Group B, where x is an integer and 1 leq x leq n-1, then the cards chosen from Group B will form a set of labels P subset {1, 2, ..., n}, and |P| = n-x. However, you know nothing about which cards in Group A have which labels. Thus, there is no way for you to prevent the x cards from Group A to form the exact set of labels Q = {1, 2, ..., n} setminus P. In such a case, there will be no matching cards, so you will not win. 3. **Conclusion of Non-Winnability**: We have covered all cases, so it follows that, once you enter state S, you cannot guarantee escape from state S or victory. Now, look at the very first move you make. Obviously, you cannot guarantee victory on the first move, as you know nothing about which cards have which labels. Assuming that you do not win on the first move, the n cards you chose have all distinct labels. The wizard then permutes the n cards you chose, so you now know that those n cards have all distinct labels but know nothing about which cards have which labels. Therefore, if you do not win on your first move, then the game enters state S, and we have already proven that you cannot guarantee victory from this point. boxed{text{The game is not winnable for } n = k.} Final Conclusion: The game is winnable if and only if n > k geq 2."},{"prompt":"A car takes 6 hours to cover a certain distance.

The center of circle C is at (2,0), and its radius r=1. 2.

Substituting the values, we get frac{|2+0+0|}{sqrt{1^2+1^2}} = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}. 3. Since the distance from the center to the line is sqrt{2} and the radius is 1, the distance from any point on the circle to the line ranges from sqrt{2}-1 to sqrt{2}+1.

Since angle A = 120^circ and the other two angles are equal (x), we can set up the equation: [ 120^circ + x + x = 180^circ ] Simplifying this, we get: [ 2x = 180^circ - 120^circ = 60^circ ] Therefore, x = frac{60^circ}{2} = 30^circ. So, the measure of angle ABF in the regular hexagon ABCDEF is boxed{30^circ}."},{"prompt":"Two players, A and B, are playing table tennis.

Taking both constraints into consideration, how many points does Donovan Mitchell need to average per game to reach his goal of 30 points per game for the season?","completion":"To calculate how many points Donovan Mitchell needs to average per game to reach his goal of 30 points per game for the season, we first need to determine how many total points he needs to score in the season. Donovan's goal is to average 30 points per game over a 20 game season, so the total points he needs to score in the season is: 30 points/game * 20 games = 600 points He has already played 15 games, averaging 26 points per game, so he has already scored: 26 points/game * 15 games = 390 points The total points he still needs to score in the remaining 5 games to reach his goal is: 600 points - 390 points = 210 points Now, considering the constraints: 1. His minutes per game will be reduced by 20%, which likely means his scoring will also decrease. However, we don't have the exact correlation between minutes and scoring, so we can't quantify this effect exactly. We'll have to ignore this constraint in our calculation, as we don't have enough information to include it. 2.

This constraint is also difficult to quantify because it's not clear how many of Donovan's points will be taken by Clarkson. We'll have to ignore this constraint as well, as we don't have enough information to include it. Ignoring the constraints (since we can't quantify them), Donovan would need to average: 210 points / 5 games = 42 points per game However, this is without considering the constraints.

The given equation is in the form where the product of two factors is zero. Thus, either of the factors must be zero. We analyze each factor separately. First, let us denote the factors as: [ f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8 - a, ] [ g(x) = x - a^2 + 6a - 8. ] 4.

Since the first digit cannot be 0, there are 5 choices for the first digit. For the second digit, we have 5 remaining choices (including 0), 4 choices for the third digit, and 3 choices for the fourth digit. Therefore, the total number of four-digit numbers that can be formed is 5 times 5 times 4 times 3 = 300. Next, we consider the numbers that are divisible by 5. For a number to be divisible by 5, its last digit must be either 0 or 5. Since we are only considering numbers formed with the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repetition, there are two cases: 1. When the last digit is 5, the first digit can be any of the 4 remaining digits (excluding 0 and 5), and the second and third digits can be any of the remaining 4 and 3 digits, respectively. So, there are 4 times 4 times 3 = 48 such numbers. 2. When the last digit is 0, the first digit cannot be 0, leaving 4 choices (1, 2, 3, 4, excluding 5 as well since it's used as the last digit). The second and third digits can be any of the remaining 4 and 3 digits, respectively. So, there are also 4 times 4 times 3 = 48 such numbers. Adding the two cases together, there are 48 + 48 = 96 numbers that are divisible by 5. Therefore, the number of four-digit numbers not divisible by 5 is 300 - 96 = 204. However, this includes numbers with 0 as the first digit, which are not considered four-digit numbers. To correct this, we subtract the numbers that have been incorrectly counted. When 0 is the first digit, there are 1 choice for the first digit (0), 4 choices for the last digit (1, 2, 3, 4, excluding 5 to avoid divisibility by 5), and 4 and 3 choices for the second and third digits, respectively. Thus, there are 1 times 4 times 4 times 3 = 48 such numbers. Subtracting these from the total, we get 204 - 48 = 156. However, upon reviewing the calculation, it appears there was an oversight in the initial explanation. The correct approach to find the number of four-digit numbers not divisible by 5 involves directly calculating the total number of valid numbers and subtracting the ones divisible by 5, without the need to adjust for numbers starting with 0 as they were correctly excluded in the initial step of choosing the first digit.

Let's proceed step by step. 1. **Initial Assertions**: - If t is coprime with 10000, and numbers r and q have different residues modulo 10000, then the products rt and qt will also have different residues. This is because if you consider pm - qm = (p-q)m, the first factor (p-q) is not divisible by 10000, and the second factor m is coprime with 10000. - If a is coprime with 10000, there exists a number a' such that a cdot a' equiv 1 pmod{10000}. The residues of a, 2a, ldots, 9999a cover all residues 1, 2, ldots, 9999, and among these residues, there is 1. Thus, a' can be chosen such that a cdot a' equiv 1 pmod{10000}. 2. **Proof by Induction**: We will prove by induction that for any n leq 10000 numbers that are coprime with 10000, the sums formed from these numbers give at least n different residues modulo 10000. - **Base Case**: For n=1, it is trivial as there is only one number and one residue. - **Inductive Step**: Assume we have n-1 numbers, and any subset of these numbers can generate sums that result in n-1 different residues modulo 10000. Now, add a new number a. We will show that including a allows us to achieve at least n different residues. - The sums S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{n-1} provide b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1} residues. If we include a, the new sums will be S_1 + a, S_2 + a, ldots, S_{n-1} + a. - Suppose a = 1. If the residues b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1} increase sequentially, then the sums S_{n-1} + a = S_{n-1} + 1 pmod{10000} gives a new residue b_{n-1} + 1 modulo 10000. - If there is a gap between some b_k and b_{k+1} such that b_{k+1} - b_k geq 2, then S_k + a provides the new residue b_k + 1 modulo 10000. 3. **Conclusion**: By inductively proving that the inclusion of every new number allows at least one additional distinct residue, we can find a combination of the given 1000 odd numbers, not divisible by 5, such that their sum has the residue 713 modulo 10000.

The interior angle and the exterior angle at any vertex of a polygon sum up to 180^{circ}. Given that an interior angle of the polygon is 180^{circ} more than three times its exterior angle, we can set up an equation to represent this relationship. Let E be the measure of an exterior angle. Then, the corresponding interior angle is 3E + 180^{circ}.

Let's correct the approach based on the provided solution: Given that an interior angle is 180^{circ} more than three times its exterior angle, we can use the relationship between the sum of interior angles and the number of sides n.

Given the correct approach: [180(n-2) = 360 times 3 + 180] This equation was meant to represent the sum of the interior angles, but it seems there was a misunderstanding in applying the relationship between interior and exterior angles directly. The correct step to find n based on the sum of interior angles or another valid property should be: For a polygon, the sum of the exterior angles is always 360^{circ}. If x is the measure of an exterior angle, then n times x = 360^{circ}. The relationship between an interior angle I and its exterior angle x is I = 180^{circ} - x.

Let's denote the number of cars in the first store as X. According to the information given, the mean number of cars is 20.8, and Dave counted cars in 5 stores. So the total number of cars he counted is the mean multiplied by the number of stores: Total cars = Mean × Number of stores Total cars = 20.8 × 5 Total cars = 104 Now we know the total number of cars Dave counted in all the stores is 104.

Considering symmetry, we only need to examine the case where line AB passes through point E(sqrt{3}, 0). Let A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). Assume the equation of line AB is x = my + sqrt{3}. Combining this with the ellipse equation, we obtain (m^2 + 3)y^2 + 2sqrt{3}my - 3 = 0. This implies y_1 + y_2 = frac{-2sqrt{3}m}{m^2 + 3} and y_1y_2 = frac{-3}{m^2 + 3}.

A triangle (three-sided polygon) can only be triangulated in one way since it is already a minimal polygon that does not require further subdivision. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_6d86e9a87432417d5c97g-312.jpg?height=314&width=322&top_left_y=794&top_left_x=867) [ text{Figure 2: This polygon has a unique triangulation} ] This example establishes that there are polygons with exactly one triangulation. 2. **Polygons with Multiple Triangulations:** To build a polygon with exactly n triangulations, we iteratively utilize the following method: - Consider a polygon shaped such that it has a structure where exactly n triangulations can be counted directly based on how we choose a pivotal vertex and then apply recursive triangulation counts on the remaining sub-polygons. 3. **Recursive Structure:** Consider a polygon with a base construction that allows a choice of one edge or vertex to define subsequent triangulation counts. For example, observe the diagram below: ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_10_6d86e9a87432417d5c97g-312.jpg?height=419&width=340&top_left_y=1247&top_left_x=858) [ text{Figure 3: Number of triangulations corresponds to the number of points along the lower arc} ] This means for k points along the arc, we have k choices for the triangle containing the edge at the top. 4. **General Construction:** For any given number of triangulations n, one such construction can be described as follows: - Let the polygon be defined such that we have (k+2) points, where choosing subsets of these points as diagonals will determine new ways to consecutively define triangles using previously calculated triangulation measures which recursively yield the desired count. 5. **Verification with Binary Operation:** Using the principle that triangulations follow combinatorial properties derived from choosing particular points across each configuration, the result follows the relationships described by Catalan numbers: [ C_{n} = frac{1}{n+1} binom{2n}{n} ] We utilize the recursive properties: [ C_{0} = 1, quad C_{1} = 1 ] and subsequently defining: [ C_{k} = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} C_{i} cdot C_{k-1-i} ] iteratively ensures for our polygon structure we can derive exactly n triangulations. # Conclusion: For every positive integer n, a polygon can indeed be constructed that admits exactly n triangulations as shown.

Let (P, Q, R,) and (S) be the points of tangency on the sides (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA), respectively. The circle inscribed in each of the triangles (APS, BPQ, CQR,) and (DRS) have centers (X, Y, Z,) and (V), respectively.

We will prove that (X_1) coincides with (X), the incenter of (Delta APS). 2. Notice that the angle between chord (X_1P) and the tangent (AP) to (omega) is equal to the inscribed angle (angle PSX_1), which subtends chord (PS). 3. Since (X_1) is the midpoint of arc (PS), the angle (angle PSX_1) is equal to the angle (angle SPX_1). Therefore, the ray (PX_1) is the bisector of (angle APS). 4. Similarly, the ray (SX_1) is the bisector of (angle ASP). Hence, the point (X_1) must be the intersection of the angle bisectors of (Delta APS), which implies that (X_1) coincides with (X). By analogous arguments, the other centers (Y, Z,) and (V) of the incircles of triangles (BPQ, CQR,) and (DRS), respectively, lie on the midpoints of their corresponding arcs. 5. Let the diagonals of quadrilateral (XYZV) intersect at point (O). 6. Observe that the sum of the arcs (SP, PQ, QR,) and (RS) gives the entire circumference of circle (omega), and the sum of the half-arcs (PX, PY, RZ,) and (RV) amounts to half of the circumference. According to a known geometrical property, the measure of the angle (angle XOY) is equal to half the sum of the arcs (XY) and (ZV). 7. Given that the total measure of a circle adds up to (360^circ), the half-sum of (XY) and (ZV) is equivalent to the half of (180^circ), which yields (90^circ), making (angle XOY = 90^circ).

Let's solve these equations step by step. 4. Expand and simplify the first equation: [ y - 2 = 3(x - 2) implies y - 2 = 3x - 6 implies y = 3x - 4 ] 5. Expand and simplify the second equation: [ y + 8 = 2(x + 8) implies y + 8 = 2x + 16 implies y = 2x + 8 ] 6. Now, we have two expressions for ( y ): [ y = 3x - 4 ] [ y = 2x + 8 ] 7. Set them equal to each other and solve for ( x ): [ 3x - 4 = 2x + 8 implies 3x - 2x = 8 + 4 implies x = 12 ] 8. Now, we substitute ( x = 12 ) back into one of the expressions to find ( y ): [ y = 3x - 4 = 3 times 12 - 4 = 36 - 4 = 32 ] 9. Conclusion: [ Xu Jun's current age = x = 12 ] (boxed{12}) --- Second Method: 10. If the teacher's age increases by (2 + 8 = 10) years from 2 years ago to 8 years later, then (10) is ( (2 cdot 10) = 20 ) years more than Xu Jun's age 2 years ago. 11. Hence we get: - The total present age difference: (y - x = 20 div 1 = 20) - Xu Jun's age 2 years ago is (10 div (2-1) = 10) 12. Xu Jun's current age is (10 + 2 = 12). 13. Conclusion: [ Xu Jun's current age is 12 ] (boxed{12})"},{"prompt":"the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, with O as the pole and the positive halfaxis as the polar axis, a polar coordinate system is established.

So the line passes through the point ( (x_1, 3) ). The slope of the line can be found using the two points we know: ( (4,0) ) and ( (x_1, 3) ). The slope ( m ) is given by the formula: [ m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} ] Using the points ( (4,0) ) and ( (x_1, 3) ), we have: [ m = frac{3 - 0}{x_1 - 4} ] [ m = frac{3}{x_1 - 4} ] Now, we also know that the line passes through another point with an x-coordinate of -12. We don't know the y-coordinate of this point, so let's call it ( y_2 ). The slope between the points ( (4,0) ) and ( (-12, y_2) ) should be the same as the slope we just found, because they lie on the same line. So we have: [ m = frac{y_2 - 0}{-12 - 4} ] [ m = frac{y_2}{-16} ] Since the slopes are equal, we can set the two expressions for ( m ) equal to each other: [ frac{3}{x_1 - 4} = frac{y_2}{-16} ] However, we don't have enough information to find ( y_2 ) or ( x_1 ) directly from this equation alone. We need more information about the line to solve for ( x_1 ). If we had the y-coordinate of the point where the x-coordinate is boxed{-12,} we could solve for ( x_1 ). Without that, we cannot determine the x-coordinate of the first point."},{"prompt":"Approximate the number 566.1234 using rounding to the nearest whole number.","completion":"To approximate the number 566.1234 using rounding to the nearest whole number, we look at the digit immediately after the decimal point, which is 1.

What are these lines?","completion":"In a cube, the lines that form an angle of 60 degrees are the line segments that represent the diagonals of the faces of the cube. Each face of a cube is a square, and the diagonal of a square divides it into two congruent right-angled triangles. Since the diagonals of a square are equal in length and bisect each other at right angles, each of these triangles is an isosceles right-angled triangle. In an isosceles right-angled triangle, the two legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of a leg. If we consider one of these triangles and draw a line from the right angle to the midpoint of the hypotenuse, we create two additional 30-60-90 triangles. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the lengths of the sides opposite the 30°, 60°, and 90° angles is 1:√3:2. Therefore, in a cube, the angle W of 60 degrees is formed by the diagonal of a face (which is boxed{√2} times a side of the cube) and a side of the cube itself.

According to the information given, B = 40.

To find the ratio of boys to girls, we divide the number of boys by the number of girls: Ratio of boys to girls = B : G Ratio of boys to girls = 40 : 104 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor. In this case, the greatest common divisor of 40 and 104 is 8. Dividing both numbers by 8, we get: Ratio of boys to girls = (40 ÷ 8) : (104 ÷ 8) Ratio of boys to girls = 5 : 13 Therefore, the ratio of boys to girls in the school is boxed{5:13} ."},{"prompt":"Given a complex number ( z ) satisfying ( left|2 z + frac{1}{z}right| = 1 ), determine the range of the principal value of the argument of ( z ).","completion":"1.

The area of the triangle formed by these sides can be calculated using Heron's formula: [ text{Area} = frac{sqrt{(x_0 + y_0 + z_0)(x_0 + y_0 - z_0)(x_0 - y_0 + z_0)(-x_0 + y_0 + z_0)}}{4} ] 2. **Sequence Definition:** The sequences are defined by the recurrence relations: [ x_{n+1} = sqrt{x_n (y_n + z_n - x_n)} ] [ y_{n+1} = sqrt{y_n (z_n + x_n - y_n)} ] [ z_{n+1} = sqrt{z_n (x_n + y_n - z_n)} ] 3. **Properties of the Sequences:** - **Triangle Inequality:** For each n, (x_n, y_n, z_n) are the sides of a triangle. This is preserved in the next step because the recurrence relations ensure that the new sides also satisfy the triangle inequality. - **Area Preservation:** The area of the triangle remains constant through each iteration. This can be shown by verifying that the area calculated using Heron's formula remains the same for (x_{n+1}, y_{n+1}, z_{n+1}). 4. **Convergence to Equilateral Triangle:** - **Decreasing Differences:** The sequences |x_n^2 - y_n^2|, |x_n^2 - z_n^2|, and |y_n^2 - z_n^2| are decreasing. This implies that the sides are becoming more similar as n increases. - **Limit to Equilateral Triangle:** As n to infty, the differences between the squares of the sides approach zero, implying that x_n, y_n, and z_n converge to the same limit l.

Therefore, we have: - f(x) = sin |2x| + |sin 2x| = sin 2x + sin 2x = 2sin 2x. Since sin 2x is decreasing in left(frac{pi}{2}, piright), 2sin 2x is also decreasing in this interval. Hence, option B is correct. 3. **Maximum value of f(x):** At 2x = frac{pi}{2}, we reach the maximum of the sine function, which is 1. Therefore, f(x) = 2sin 2x = 2 cdot 1 = 2 at this point. This confirms that the maximum value of f(x) is 2, making option D correct. 4. **Number of zeros in the interval left[-pi, piright]:** The function f(x) is zero at x = 0 and x = frac{pi}{2}. Given that f(x) is an even function, the zeros at x = 0 and x = frac{pi}{2} imply there are corresponding zeros at x = -frac{pi}{2}. This gives us a total of 3 zeros in the interval left[-pi, piright], not 5. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

(II) To prove that f(x) is an increasing function on (-1,1), let's take -1 < x_1 < x_2 < 1. Then: f(x_2)-f(x_1)=frac{x_2}{1+x_2^{2}}-frac{x_1}{1+x_1^{2}}. This simplifies to: frac{(x_2-x_1)(1-x_1x_2)}{(1+x_1^{2})(1+x_2^{2})}. Since -1 < x_1 < x_2 < 1, we have: 0 < x_1x_2 < 1, which implies: 1-x_1x_2 > 0. Thus: frac{(x_2-x_1)(1-x_1x_2)}{(1+x_1^{2})(1+x_2^{2})} > 0. So, f(x_2)-f(x_1) > 0, which proves that f(x) is an increasing function on (-1,1). (III) Since the function is odd, we have: f(-x)=-f(x).

Our goal is to prove that ( XX', YY' ), and ( ZZ' ) are common chords of a circle that share a coaxial relationship. 1. **Using the invariance of cross ratios:** By the property of the invariance of the cross ratio in projective geometry, we have: [ left[X, Y'; Z, Z' right] = left[B, D; Z, Z'right] = left[Y, X'; Z, Z'right] ] This equivalence gives us: [ frac{ZX}{ZY'} cdot frac{Z'Y'}{Z'X} = frac{ZY}{ZX'} cdot frac{Z'X'}{Z'Y} ] This equation ensures that the cross ratio remains constant. 2. **Intersecting with the common chord:** Now, let us consider a circle with common chord ( XX' ) and another common chord ( YY' ). Let these intersect line ( l ) at point ( O ). Define: [ OX = x, quad OX' = x', quad OY = y, quad OY' = y', quad OZ = z, quad OZ' = z' ] 3. **Relate segments:** Considering the product of segments from the intersecting chords, we have: [ xx' = yy' = s ] where ( s ) is a constant value representing the power of the point ( O ) with respect to the circle with these common chords. 4. **Expand and simplify the equation:** [ (x - z)(y' - z')(x' - z)(y - z') = (x - z')(y' - z)(x' - z')(y - z) ] Begin by expanding and rearranging terms: [ Rightarrow left(x x' - z(x + x') + z^2 right) cdot left(y y' - z'(y + y') + z'^2 right) = left(x x' - z'(x + x') + z'^2 right) cdot left(y y' - z(y + y') + z^2 right) ] Grouping the terms accordingly, we obtain: [ Rightarrow s(z^2 + z'^2 - z(x + x') - z'(y + y')) + zz'(z - x - x')(z' - y - y') ] [ = s(z^2 + z'^2 - z'(x + x') - z(y + y')) + zz'(z' - x - x')(z - y - y') ] 5. **Simplify further:** Equate symmetrical terms: [ Rightarrow s(z - z')(y + y' - x - x') = zz'(z - z')(y + y' - x - x') ] Given non-zero ( (z - z')(y + y' - x - x') ), we can divide both sides by this expression to find: [ Rightarrow zz' = s ] 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, ( zz' = s ) shows that ( XX', YY', ZZ' ) are indeed common chords of a circle that share a coaxial relationship.

We need to construct such a number that its last 1000 digits contain no zeros. 2. **Constructing the Number**: - Suppose that among the digits of ( n cdot 5^{1000} ), there is a zero digit at position ( r ) (where the rightmost digit is at position ( 0 )). - We can eliminate this zero by multiplying the number by another appropriately chosen factor. 3. **Eliminating Zero Digits**: - Consider the term ( n cdot 5^{1000} ). We will eliminate the zero at position ( r ) by modifying the number such that it has a non-zero digit at position ( r ). - We can use the multiplication by ( 10^r + 1 ) to achieve this: [ n cdot 5^{1000} cdot (10^r + 1) ] - This results in modifying the digits from position ( 0 ) to ( r-1 ) and replacing the zero at position ( r ) with a non-zero digit. 4. **Iterative Replacement**: - If we repeatedly apply this process for positions where there is a zero, we will eventually end up with a multiple of ( 5^{1000} ) that has no zeros in the last 1000 digits. 5. **Reduction Modulo ( 2^{1000} )**: - Let ( n ) be such that ( n cdot 5^{1000} ) has no zeros in the last 1000 digits. Let ( m ) be the remainder when ( n ) is divided by ( 2^{1000} ), such that: [ n = k cdot 2^{1000} + m ] - Therefore: [ n cdot 5^{1000} = (k cdot 2^{1000} + m) cdot 5^{1000} implies n cdot 5^{1000} = k cdot (2 cdot 5)^{1000} + m cdot 5^{1000} implies n cdot 5^{1000} = k cdot 10^{1000} + m cdot 5^{1000} ] 6. **Last 1000 Digits Examination**: - It follows that the last 1000 digits of ( m cdot 5^{1000} ) are the same as those of ( n cdot 5^{1000} ) because ( k cdot 10^{1000} ) contributes only higher-order zeros. - Since ( n cdot 5^{1000} ) has no zeros in the last 1000 digits, ( m cdot 5^{1000} ) will likewise have no zeros and will have exactly 1000 digits. # Conclusion: Hence, there exists a number ( m cdot 5^{1000} ) that is divisible by ( 5^{1000} ) and contains no zero digit in its decimal representation. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"takes Derek some minutes to walk a mile if he doesn't have to walk with his brother.

The goal is to determine for which values of n it is possible to swap the colors of the chessboard pattern (i.e., black cells become white and white cells become black) within a finite number of moves. 2. **Cell Types and Color Changes**: Define two types of cells based on their initial colors: - Type 1 cells: Initially white. - Type 2 cells: Initially black. Note that a cell color will revert to its original color after being repainted three times: - A white cell painted three times becomes white again. - A black cell painted three times becomes black again.

Since ( P ) is on ( AB ), we can write the coordinates of ( P ) as ( (t, 0) ) for some rational number ( t ). 4. **Ratios on AB:** If ( P ) lies on ( AB ), then ( PA ) and ( PB ) are simply the distances on a line: - ( PA = t ) - ( PB = 1 - t ) Clearly, if ( t ) is rational, both ( PA ) and ( PB ) are rational. 5. **Distance from P to C:** To find ( PC ), use the distance formula. The coordinates of ( C ), the vertex opposite ( AB ), can be ( left( frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) ).

This means that the candidate's score is M + 15. In terms of the total marks T, this can be written as: (45/100) * T = M + 15 (2) We are given that the number of marks for passing is approximately 120, so M ≈ 120. Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (P and T). We can solve these equations to find the value of P, which is the percentage of marks the first candidate gets. From equation (2), we can express T in terms of M: T = (M + 15) / (45/100) T = (M + 15) / 0.45 Substitute this expression for T into equation (1): (P/100) * ((M + 15) / 0.45) = M - 30 Now, we can solve for P: P = (100 * (M - 30) * 0.45) / (M + 15) Since M ≈ 120, we can substitute this value into the equation: P = (100 * (120 - 30) * 0.45) / (120 + 15) P = (100 * 90 * 0.45) / 135 P = (100 * 90 * 0.45) / 135 P = (4050) / 135 P = 30 Therefore, the percentage of marks the first candidate gets is approximately boxed{30%} ."},{"prompt":"Suppose a sequence ( s_1, s_2, ldots ) of positive integers satisfies ( s_{n+2} = s_{n+1} + s_n ) for all positive integers ( n ) (but not necessarily ( s_1 = s_2 = 1 ) ).

Let circle (K) be tangent to sides (b) and (c) with radius (r), and circle (L) be tangent to sides (a) and (c) with radius (t). 3. For circle (K), let the center be (K). Since it is tangent to side (b) at (C), we have (KC = r). Let the circle also be tangent to side (c) at (C'). Thus, (KC' = r). 4. Since (angle CAB = angle CAB) and (angle AC'K = angle ACB = 90^circ), the triangles (triangle AKC') and (triangle ABC) are similar by AA similarity. 5. This similarity gives us the ratio: [ frac{KC'}{BC} = frac{AK}{AB} ] Substituting the known lengths, we get: [ frac{r}{a} = frac{b - r}{c} ] 6.

However, when c = 0, both sides equal zero regardless of the values of a and b, and the proposition does not imply a > b. Thus, this statement is only conditionally true. 2. If a > b and c > d, then a+c > b+d; this is correct by the property of the addition of inequalities. Adding the two inequalities together we have a - b > 0 and c - d > 0, it follows that (a - b) + (c - d) > 0, which simplifies to a + c > b + d. 3. If a > b and c > d, then ac > bd; this is not necessarily correct without additional information about the signs of a, b, c, d. For example, if a > b and c > d but c and d are negative, the product ac could be less than bd. Eg. let a=3, b=2, c=-2, d=-3, we find that ac=3(-2)=-6 < -6=bd, contradicting the statement. 4.

When a and b are negative, this property does not hold, for example, if a = -1 and b = -2, clearly -1 > -2 but frac{1}{-1} = -1 is not greater than frac{1}{-2} = -0.5.

Find all natural numbers ( n ) for which at least half of the divisors are good.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a natural number ( n > 1 ). A divisor ( d ) of ( n ) is called \\"good\\" if ( d + 1 ) is also a divisor of ( n ). We need to find all natural numbers ( n ) such that at least half of the divisors of ( n ) are good. 2. **Key Insights:** - If ( d ) is a good divisor, then ( d + 1 ) is also a divisor of ( n ). Therefore, for ( n ) to have a good divisor ( d ), ( n ) must be divisible by ( d(d+1) ). - Since ( d ) and ( d + 1 ) are coprime (i.e., gcd( (d, d+1) = 1 )), ( n ) must be divisible by the product ( d(d + 1) ). This means: [ n geq d(d + 1) > d^2 ] Hence, ( d < sqrt{n} ). 3. **Finding Good Divisors:** - For any divisor ( d ), there is a corresponding divisor ( frac{n}{d} ) such that ( d times frac{n}{d} = n ). - If ( d < sqrt{n} ), then ( frac{n}{d} > sqrt{n} ). This implies that at most one of ( d ) or ( frac{n}{d} ) can be less than ( sqrt{n} ). 4. **Condition on Good Divisors:** - Since ( n ) needs to have at least half of its divisors being good, all divisors less than ( sqrt{n} ) must be good. This ensures that at least half of the divisors greater than or equal to ( sqrt{n} ) can correspond to the good divisors that are less than ( sqrt{n} ). 5. **Initial Verification:** - The number 1 is always a divisor and ( 1 < sqrt{n} ). Thus, for 1 to be good, ( 2 ) must be a divisor of ( n ). 6. **Further Analysis:** By continuing the logic, all numbers from 1 up to ( k = leftlfloor sqrt{n} rightrfloor ) must be divisors of ( n ). This implies ( n ) has a certain structure: - If ( n ) has three divisors, then ( n ) must be divisible by ( k, k-1, ) and ( k-2 ). This gives: [ frac{1}{2}k(k-1)(k-2) leq n < (k+1)^2 ] 7. **Solving the Cubic Inequality:** - Simplifying the inequality gives: [ 4k^2 + 1 > k^3 ] Which yields ( k leq 4 ). 8. **Checking Possible ( k ) Values:** - ( k = 2 ), ( k = 3 ), and ( k = 4 ) need to be verified: - For ( k = 2 ): [ n = text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6 ] - For ( k = 3 ): [ n = text{lcm}(2, 3, 4) = 12 ] - Both values are checked to ensure they fulfill the condition, resulting in another number: - ( n = 2 ) is also a solution because 2 itself satisfies the initial condition. 9. **Conclusion:** The natural numbers ( n ) such that at least half of its divisors are good are: [ boxed{2, 6, 12} ]"},{"prompt":"Convert frac{4}{3}pi radians to degrees ( ) A: 210° B: 240° C: 270° D: 300°","completion":"Since pi=180^circ, therefore frac{4}{3}pi = frac{4}{3} times 180^circ = 240^circ.

There were three age groups for ticket pricing: child, adult, and senior citizen.

For every 5 tickets purchased, they received a 3 discount on the total ticket price, and they also had a 10% concession discount coupon. Ashley's family bought two adult tickets, four children's tickets, and one senior citizen ticket. How much did they spend on tickets and concessions, considering the discounts and coupon?","completion":"First, let's calculate the cost of each type of ticket: 1. Children's tickets cost 4.25 each. 2. Adult tickets cost 3.50 more than children's tickets, so they cost 4.25 + 3.50 = 7.75 each. 3. Senior citizen tickets cost 1.75 less than adult tickets, so they cost 7.75 - 1.75 = 6.00 each. Now, let's calculate the total cost of tickets before any discounts: - Two adult tickets cost 2 * 7.75 = 15.50. - Four children's tickets cost 4 * 4.25 = 17.00. - One senior citizen ticket costs 1 * 6.00 = 6.00. The total cost before discounts is 15.50 + 17.00 + 6.00 = 38.50. Ashley's family bought a total of 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 tickets. For every 5 tickets purchased, they received a 3 discount. Since they bought 7 tickets, they are eligible for one 3 discount. The new total cost after the ticket discount is 38.50 - 3.00 = 35.50. Now, let's consider the 10% concession discount coupon. Since this coupon applies to concessions and not to the ticket price, we need to know the cost of the concessions to calculate the discount. However, the information provided does not include the cost of concessions. Therefore, we cannot calculate the exact amount spent on concessions with the 10% discount. Without the cost of concessions, we can only calculate the total spent on tickets, which is boxed{35.50} after the ticket discount. If you can provide the cost of concessions, we can include the 10% discount on that amount to give you the total spent on both tickets and concessions."},{"prompt":"Tony makes 60% of his initial 30 basketball shots.

Can the sum of the diameters of these spheres be greater than 4?","completion":"Problem: Can the sum of the diameters of 8 non-intersecting spheres placed in a cube with edge length 1 be greater than 4? Reference Solution: 1. Consider a cube A B C D A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} D^{prime} with edge length 1. Split this cube into 8 smaller cubes, each having an edge length of 1/2. 2. Place black spheres into the cubes adjacent to vertices A, C, B^{prime}, D^{prime} and white spheres into the remaining cubes. 3. Note that each black sphere touches three white spheres and vice versa. Spheres of the same color do not share any common points. 4. Next, replace the black spheres with spheres of diameter 1/2 + varepsilon, and the white spheres with spheres of diameter 1/2 - varepsilon, where varepsilon > 0 and is less than half the minimum distance between black spheres to ensure that no spheres overlap. 5. Observe that each black sphere still touches three edges of the cube and does not overlap with any other black sphere. The same holds for the white spheres with their corresponding vertices. 6. To confirm that spheres of different colors do not intersect: - Let O_1 and O_2 be the centers of two such spheres at vertices A and B, with radii r_1 and r_2, respectively. - The projection of the segment O_1O_2 on AB is 1 - r_1 - r_2 = 1/2. Because r_1 neq r_2, the line O_1O_2 is not parallel to AB, implying O_1O_2 > 1/2 = r_1 + r_2. - Thus, all spheres of different colors do not share any points. 7. Given that these smaller spheres can touch the corners without intersecting each other, we can increase the sum of their diameters. 8. The original configuration's combined diameters of smaller spheres is 4 times (1/2 + varepsilon) + 4 times (1/2 - varepsilon) = 4. However, since varepsilon > 0, increasing the radius slightly for each sphere ensures their total diameter could surpass 4.

To determine whether it's possible to form a palindrome, consider all possible pairs of letters in the word. Let us call pairs a ldots b, b ldots c, and c ldots a good pairs, and pairs a ldots c, c ldots b, and b ldots a bad pairs. 2. When inserting a card, there are two good and one bad pair within it. 3. Since different characters \\"insert into the same place\\", with each insertion, they form three new pairs per existing character: a neutral, good, and bad pair. 4. Therefore, the number of good pairs always exceeds the number of bad pairs. A palindrome should have an equal number of good and bad pairs due to its symmetrical nature. 5. Thus, it is impossible to form a palindrome solely using the given cards under these constraints. **Answer to MCQ a:** boxed{text{No, it's impossible.}} **Solution to MCQ b:** 1.

Since the function is a product of multiple terms, we can apply the product rule, which states that the derivative of a product of two functions u(x) and v(x) can be expressed as u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x). However, since we have more than two functions multiplied together here, we will need to apply the product rule iteratively or use a shortcut for multiple terms, known as Leibniz's rule for differentiation of a product of n functions. Leibniz's rule states that if we have a product of n differentiable functions, the derivative of this product is the sum of all possible products we get by differentiating each function in turn and multiplying by the product of the other undifferentiated functions. In this case, we can differentiate f(x) by differentiating each term in turn and summing the products: f'(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x-4)(x - 5) + x(x - 2)(x - 3)(x-4)(x - 5) + x(x - 1)(x - 3)(x-4)(x - 5) + x(x - 1)(x - 2)(x-4)(x - 5) + x(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 5) + x(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4).

(Total daily cost = Cost per piece times Daily sales volume)","completion":"Let's break down the solution step by step, following the given problem and solution structure: # Part 1: Find the function expression between y and x Given that the cost per piece is 50 yuan, and the base selling price is 100 yuan with a daily sales volume of 50 pieces. For every 1 yuan decrease in the selling price, an additional 5 pieces can be sold. The profit, y, can be calculated as the difference between the selling price, x, and the cost, multiplied by the number of pieces sold. The number of pieces sold can be expressed as 50 + 5(100 - x), where 100 - x represents the decrease in the selling price from the base price. Therefore, the function expression between y and x is: [ y = (x - 50)[50 + 5(100 - x)] ] Expanding this gives: [ y = (x - 50)(-5x + 550) ] Further simplifying: [ y = -5x^2 + 800x - 27500 ] So, the function expression between y and x is boxed{y = -5x^2 + 800x - 27500}, for 50 leqslant x leqslant 100. # Part 2: Determine the selling price for maximum daily profit The given quadratic function is y = -5x^2 + 800x - 27500. This can be rewritten in vertex form to find the maximum value easily: [ y = -5(x^2 - 160x) - 27500 ] Completing the square: [ y = -5(x - 80)^2 + 4500 ] Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative (-5), the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum point at the vertex. The vertex of this parabola is at (80, 4500), meaning the maximum profit of boxed{4500} yuan occurs when the selling price is boxed{80} yuan. # Part 3: Minimum total cost per day for a daily profit not less than 4000 yuan To ensure a daily profit of at least 4000 yuan, we set the profit function equal to 4000: [ -5(x - 80)^2 + 4500 = 4000 ] Solving this equation gives two values for x, which are x_1 = 70 and x_2 = 90. This means the selling price should be between 70 yuan and 90 yuan to ensure a profit of at least 4000 yuan. Calculating the total cost for x = 70: [ 50 times (-5 times 70 + 550) = 10000 ] And for x = 90: [ 50 times (-5 times 90 + 550) = 5000 ] Therefore, to ensure a daily profit of at least 4000 yuan, the minimum total cost per day should be boxed{5000} yuan."},{"prompt":"Given that f(x) = x^{2} 3x + 4 and g(x) = x 2, what is the value of f(g(3)) g(f(3))?","completion":"1.

If he scores 92 runs in his next innings, his new total runs will be ( T + 92 ), and the number of innings played will be ( n + 1 ).

The number m(S), which counts the circles through 3 points with the fourth as an interior point, is 1 because only D lies inside circle ABC. - If all four points form a convex quadrilateral (say ABCD in counterclockwise order), without loss of generality: [ angle ABD > angle ACD ] Then: - Point B lies inside the circle ACD and thus counts as one such interior circle. - Point D lies inside the circle ABC, adding to our count. Thus: [ m(S) = 2 text{ (circles through 3 points with one inside)} ] 3. **Generalization to n > 4:** For n > 4, let c(S) be the number of convex subsets of 4 points. - Each convex subset of 4 points contributes exactly 2 circles through 3 points with the fourth inside. - The total number of 4-element subsets of S is binom{n}{4}. - Hence, there are binom{n}{4} - c(S) subsets that are not convex, and each of these contributes exactly 1 circle.

[ m(S) = c(S) + binom{n}{4} = binom{n}{4} + binom{n}{4} = 2 cdot binom{n}{4} ] This matches f(n) which we defined as 2 binom{n}{4}. - Conversely, if m(S) = f(n): [ m(S) = 2 binom{n}{4} ] Then: [ 2 c(S) + (binom{n}{4} - c(S)) = 2 binom{n}{4} ] Simplifying yields: [ c(S) = binom{n}{4} ] Hence, every subset of 4 points must be convex, thus S is convex. **Conclusion:** The points of S are the vertices of a convex polygon if and only if: [ m(S) = f(n) = 2 cdot binom{n}{4} ] [ boxed{m(S) = 2 binom{n}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that a, b, c in mathbb{R}^+, and a + b + c = 1, prove that (frac{1}{a} 1)(frac{1}{b} 1)(frac{1}{c} 1) geqslant 8.","completion":"Proof: Since a, b, c in (0, +infty) and a + b + c = 1, (frac{1}{a} - 1)(frac{1}{b} - 1)(frac{1}{c} - 1) = frac{(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)}{abc} = frac{(b+c)(a+c)(a+b)}{abc} Using the AM-GM inequality, we have: (b+c)(a+c)(a+b) geqslant (2sqrt{bc})(2sqrt{ac})(2sqrt{ab}) = 8abc, with equality if and only if a = b = c = frac{1}{3}.

Let’s construct a plane pi through the midpoint of the segment A_1A_4, perpendicular to this segment (refer to diagram 81). 3. **Intersection Continuity:** This plane is not parallel to the face A_1A_2A_3 and hence intersects face A_1A_2A_3 at a point O. 4. **Equidistance Property:** Point O is equidistant from each vertex of face A_1A_2A_3. It is also equidistant from vertices A_1 and A_4. Consequently, the point O is equidistant from all four vertices A_1, A_2, A_3, and A_4 of the tetrahedron. 5. **Perpendicular Property:** Due to this equidistance, O lies on the perpendicular from the center of each circumscribed circle around any face of the tetrahedron. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the four perpendiculars intersect at point O, which is the center of the circumscribed sphere around the tetrahedron.

Given that both of them play optimally to maximize their probability of winning, what is the probability that Rachel wins?","completion":"1. **Problem Setup**: - Sarah starts at position (0,0). - Rachel starts at position (6,8). - Sarah can move only 1 unit in the positive x or y direction. - Rachel can move only 1 unit in the negative x or y direction. - Sarah catches Rachel if they end up at the same point. - Rachel wins if she reaches (0,0) without being caught. - We need to find the probability that Rachel wins, assuming both play optimally. 2. **Claim**: For an ( n times m ) grid where ( n leq m ) and ( n equiv m pmod{2} ), the probability that Sarah wins is ( frac{1}{2^n} ) under optimal play. 3. **Proof by Induction**: - **Base Case**: ( n = 0 ): When ( n = 0 ), Rachel is confined to a straight line (since there's no vertical movement). Sarah is guaranteed to win because Rachel must move to Sarah's starting position. Hence, the probability that Sarah wins is ( 1 ). - **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume the probability that Sarah wins on an ( (n-1) times (n-1) ) grid is ( frac{1}{2^{n-1}} ). - **Step for ( n = m )**: We consider the ( n times n ) grid: - If Sarah and Rachel move in the same parallel direction at the start, Rachel can keep moving in this direction and Sarah will not be able to catch her. The game reduces to ( n-1 ) steps from the new positions. - The reduction happens with probability ( frac{1}{2} ) because if they move in the same direction, it doesn’t affect the win probability by induction. Given Rachel and Sarah have equal chances of moving in the same direction or differently, thus the probability that Sarah wins after one move becomes: [ frac{1}{2} times 1 + frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2^{n-1}} = frac{1}{2^n} ] 4. **Case for ( n < m )**: - Assume both players will move in the longer (( m )) direction until they reach a corner of an ( n times n ) grid. - If Rachel moves in the ( n ) direction and Sarah in the ( m ) direction, Rachel can navigate until she reaches the other side of the grid. - If Rachel also moves in the ( n ) direction, it reduces to ( (n-1) times (m-1) ) grid, where Sarah's win probability doubles to ( frac{1}{2^{n-1}} ). This observation ensures that it’s optimal for Rachel to move to create ( n times n ) grid, else Sarah wins immediately. 5. **Conclusion**: Given the values ( n = 6 ) and ( m = 8 ), under optimal moves the game reduces to a ( 6 times 6 ) grid with the probability of Sarah winning ( frac{1}{2^6} = frac{1}{64} ).

If such a line cuts through (triangle PQR), it must cut at exactly two points. Therefore, these lines cut through (triangle PQR) an even number of times. - **Type 2:** Lines joining another point (X) with (P, Q,) and (R).

Then, (d(PQ)) is odd and (d(PR)) is even, so (d(QR)) is even, making ((Q, R)) good. - **Case 4:** (Q) is blue and (R) is red.

Since we need to have at least one full-time employee (because we can't have all employees be part-time), let's assume the minimum for F is 1. This would make P = 48 - 1 = 47 (all remaining employees are part-time). Now, the number of part-time employees who take the subway is (1/3) * 47. However, since we can't have a fraction of an employee, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. (1/3) * 47 = 15.666..., which we round down to 15. The number of full-time employees who take the subway is (1/4) * 1 = 0.25, which we also round down to 0 (since we can't have a fraction of an employee). Therefore, the greatest possible number r of employees who take the subway to work is 15 (from the part-time employees) + 0 (from the full-time employees) = boxed{15} ."},{"prompt":"Convert the equation x^2+2x3=0 into the form (x+m)^2=n.

Therefore, we have 5 choices for the exponent of (3) and 5 choices for the exponent of (67).

After every ten miles, he rests for a certain amount of time. He takes 332 minutes to walk 50 miles. How many minutes does he rest after every ten miles?","completion":"First, let's calculate the time it takes for the man to walk 50 miles without any rest. Since the man walks at a rate of 10 mph, he would take 1 hour to walk 10 miles. Therefore, to walk 50 miles, he would take 5 hours (since 50 miles / 10 mph = 5 hours). Now, let's convert the 5 hours into minutes to match the units of the total time given (332 minutes). There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 5 hours is equivalent to 5 * 60 = 300 minutes. The total time taken for the journey is 332 minutes, and the walking time is 300 minutes. The difference between these two times is the total rest time. Total rest time = Total time - Walking time Total rest time = 332 minutes - 300 minutes Total rest time = 32 minutes Since the man rests after every ten miles, and he has walked 50 miles, he would have rested 4 times (after 10, 20, 30, and 40 miles). To find the rest time after each ten miles, we divide the total rest time by the number of rests.

Since 10 percent of his balls are basketballs, we calculate: 10% of 100 balls = 0.10 * 100 = 10 basketballs Now we know Lucca has 10 basketballs. Since Lucca and Lucien together have 50 basketballs, we can find out how many basketballs Lucien has by subtracting Lucca's basketballs from the total: 50 basketballs (total) - 10 basketballs (Lucca's) = 40 basketballs (Lucien's) Now we need to find out what percentage of Lucien's balls are basketballs. We have the number of basketballs Lucien has (40) and the total number of balls he has (200). To find the percentage, we use the formula: Percentage = (Number of basketballs / Total number of balls) * 100 So for Lucien: Percentage = (40 / 200) * 100 = 0.20 * 100 = 20% Therefore, boxed{20} percent of Lucien's balls are basketballs."},{"prompt":"A train, 800 meters long, is running with a certain speed.

Thus, the calculation is as follows: [ frac{1}{2}left(1 - frac{19}{25}right) times 500 = frac{1}{2} times frac{6}{25} times 500 = frac{3}{25} times 500 = 60 ] Therefore, the number of volunteers among them whose value of immune response protein M is not less than 20 is approximately boxed{60}.

By removing two squares, we are left with (64 - 2 = 62) squares. Since each domino covers 2 squares, the number of dominos required to cover 62 squares would be: [ frac{62}{2} = 31 ] This is a feasible number in theory because 31 is an integer. 3. **Checkerboard Pattern Analysis:** Consider the chessboard colored in a checkerboard pattern: - The top-left square (usually removed) is white. - The bottom-right square (also removed) is white.

Each domino, needing to cover an equal amount of black and white squares, cannot balance the uneven count of 30 white squares and 32 black squares. This imbalance in color coverage means that no matter how dominos are placed, two black squares will always remain uncovered.

We know that: - Cows have 4 legs each. - Hens have 2 legs each. - Both cows and hens have 1 head each. From the information given, we know that C = 4 (there are 4 cows). The total number of legs (L) in the group is the sum of the legs of cows and hens: L = 4C + 2H The total number of heads (D) in the group is the sum of the heads of cows and hens: D = C + H According to the problem, the number of legs is some more than twice the number of heads.

The team can either win, draw, or lose with points allocated as follows: - Win: (2) points - Draw: (-1) point - Lose: (0) points 2. **Probability Calculation**: Given that both teams are equally matched, the probability of a draw in any match is ( p ). Therefore, the probability of either team winning (and hence the other losing) is ( frac{1-p}{2} ) for each team. 3. **Equality of Points Condition**: Teams ( A ) and ( B ) will have equal points after two matches in the following cases: - Both matches end in a draw. - One match is won by team ( A ) and the other by team ( B ). 4. **Calculation of Equal Points Probability**: - The probability of both matches ending in a draw is ( p^2 ). - The probability of team ( A ) winning one match and team ( B ) winning the other match (or vice versa) is given by: [ 2 cdot left(frac{1-p}{2}right) cdot left(frac{1-p}{2}right) = frac{(1-p)^2}{2} ] Here, we multiply by 2 to account for two combinations: ((A text{ wins first, B wins second}) ) and ((B text{ wins first, A wins second})). 5. **Total Probability of Equal Points**: The total probability ( f(p) ) of the teams having equal points is the sum of the probabilities from step 4: [ f(p) = p^2 + frac{(1-p)^2}{2} ] Simplifying this, we get: [ f(p) = p^2 + frac{1 - 2p + p^2}{2} = p^2 + frac{1}{2} - p + frac{p^2}{2} = frac{3p^2 - 2p + 1}{4} ] 6. **Behavior of the Function ( f(p) )**: To analyze how the function ( frac{3p^2 - 2p + 1}{4} ) behaves with respect to ( p ), we can study its derivative to understand where it increases or decreases. However, given its quadratic nature: - The quadratic function ( 3p^2 - 2p + 1 ) represents an upward-opening parabola. - The vertex of this parabola, corresponding to its minimum point, is at ( p = frac{-b}{2a} = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3} ). 7. **Implication on Probability**: Since the function ( 3p^2 - 2p + 1 ) decreases on the interval ( left[0, frac{1}{3} right] ): - For ( p ) in this interval, increasing ( p ) does not necessarily increase ( f(p) ); it may decrease. - Thus, the probability of the teams receiving an equal number of points might actually decrease as ( p ) (the probability of a draw) increases from 0 to (frac{1}{3}). # Conclusion: Therefore, it is not always true that an increase in the probability ( p ) of a draw will increase the probability that teams ( A ) and ( B ) will end the two-match series with equal points.

The length of the floor is given as 10 meters. The rug covers the floor except for a 2-meter-wide strip along each of the four edges. This means that the rug's length is 10 - 2 - 2 = 6 meters (since 2 meters are subtracted from each end of the length), and its width is ( w - 2 - 2 = w - 4 ) meters (since 2 meters are subtracted from each side of the width). The area of the rug is given as 24 square meters. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, for the rug, we have: Area of the rug = Length of the rug × Width of the rug 24 m² = 6 m × (w - 4) m Now, we can solve for ( w ): 24 m² = 6 m × (w - 4) m 24 m² = 6w - 24 m² 24 m² + 24 m² = 6w 48 m² = 6w w = 48 m² / 6 w = 8 m So, the width of the floor is boxed{8} meters."},{"prompt":"Given the real numbers a and b satisfying the equation frac{1}{a} + frac{4}{b} = sqrt{ab}, the minimum value of ab is ( ).

This symmetry will be crucial in proving the concyclicity of the circumcenters. 5. **Symmetry and Cyclic Nature:** - Consider the hexagon (ABCDEF) and the point (M). The symmetry implied by the equal areas of the quadrilaterals suggests that (M) is a special point, likely the centroid or a point related to the symmetry of the hexagon. 6. **Circumcenters and Concyclic Points:** - To show that the circumcenters are concyclic, we need to show that there exists a circle that passes through all these circumcenters. 7. **Using Radical Axes:** - Consider the circumcircles of triangles (ABM) and (BCM). Let their circumcenters be (O_1) and (O_2) respectively. The radical axis of these two circles is the line perpendicular to the line segment (O_1O_2) at the midpoint of (O_1O_2). - Similarly, consider the circumcircles of triangles (CDM) and (DEM) with circumcenters (O_3) and (O_4), and the circumcircles of triangles (EFM) and (FAM) with circumcenters (O_5) and (O_6). 8. **Intersection of Radical Axes:** - The radical axes of these pairs of circumcircles will intersect at a common point, which is the center of the circle passing through all the circumcenters (O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4, O_5, O_6). 9. **Conclusion:** - Since the radical axes intersect at a common point, the circumcenters (O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4, O_5, O_6) are concyclic.
