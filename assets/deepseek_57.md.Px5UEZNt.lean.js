Since a_{3}=a_{1}+2d, we also know that 2a_{3}=14, leading to a_{3}=7. 4. **Geometric Sequence Condition**: The condition that a_{2}-1, a_{3}+1, a_{4}+7 form a geometric sequence gives us left(a_{3}+1right)^{2}=left(a_{2}-1right)left(a_{4}+7right). Substituting a_{3}=7 into this equation yields left(7+1right)^{2}=left(a_{1}+d-1right)left(a_{1}+3d+7right). 5. **Solving for d**: Simplifying the equation gives us 64=left(6-dright)left(14+dright). Solving this quadratic equation for d, we find d=2 or d=-10. 6. **Monotonically Increasing Sequence**: Since the sequence is increasing, d>0, which means d=2.

We know that 230 students study numeric methods, 423 study automatic control of airborne vehicles, and 134 study both. To find the total number of second-year students who study at least one of these subjects, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion because the 134 students who study both subjects are included in both the 230 and the 423 counts. So, the number of second-year students who study at least one of the subjects is: 230 (numeric methods) + 423 (automatic control) - 134 (both) = 230 + 423 - 134 = 519 students.

The distance between the observation point and the point directly below the cloud on the lake surface is x. From the elevation angle of 30°, we have tan 30° = frac{H - h}{x}. Since tan 30° = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}, we get x = (H - h)sqrt{3}. From the depression angle of 45° to the reflection of the cloud, we know the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Thus, the depression angle to the actual cloud is also 45°, which means tan 45° = 1 = frac{H + h}{x}. Substituting x from the previous equation, we get H + h = (H - h)sqrt{3}. Solving this equation for H, we find H = h(sqrt{3} + 1) = 10(sqrt{3} + 1) approx 27.3 m. Therefore, the height of the cloud above the lake surface is H = 27.3 m.

This simplifies to x for x geq 0, because squaring the square root of x returns x itself, but only when x is non-negative. - The comparison reveals that f(x) = |x| and g(x) = x for x geq 0. Since f(x) accounts for both positive and negative x through its absolute value, while g(x) only equals x for non-negative values, they do not represent the same function. **Option B:** - For f(x), we have f(x) = 1.

By factoring x^2 - 1 as a difference of squares, g(x) simplifies to frac{(x + 1)(x - 1)}{x - 1}, which further simplifies to x + 1 for x neq 1. - Though f(x) and g(x) have the same expression for x + 1, g(x) is undefined at x = 1 due to division by zero.

Mathematically, if we regard the sequence of numbers as (a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{37}), we have: [ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 29, ] [ a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 = 29, ] and so on, up to [ a_{32} + a_{33} + a_{34} + a_{35} + a_{36} + a_{37} = 29. ] 2. **Sum of First 36 Numbers**: From the previous step, we see that each set of six consecutive numbers sums to 29. To find the sum of the first 36 numbers, we can see that there are 6 such groups: [ (a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6) + (a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7) + cdots + (a_{31} + a_{32} + a_{33} + a_{34} + a_{35} + a_{36}). ] Since each group of six numbers sums to 29 and each number (a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{36}) is counted six times within these overlapping groups, the sum of the first 36 numbers (counting each number five times for the first five and one more for the last 31 numbers), adds up to: [ text{Sum of the first 36 numbers} = 6 cdot 29 = 174. ] 3. **Sum of Last 36 Numbers**: Similarly, the sum of the last 36 numbers can be calculated in a similar fashion to the sum of the first 36.

We need to prove that it is possible to organize the sports activities of this society in the described manner. 2. **Step 1 - Initialization**: Select one member of this society, say X. We arbitrarily choose: - n tennis partners for X: label them as T_1, T_2, ldots, T_n, - n chess partners for X: label them as S_1, S_2, ldots, S_n, - n pingpong partners for X: label them as P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n. 3. **Step 2 - Assigning Games for Remaining Pairs**: For any pair of members that do not include X, the sports game they play is determined as follows: - If both members are tennis partners of X (both are in {T_1, T_2, ..., T_n}), then they play tennis with each other. - If both are chess partners of X (both are in {S_1, S_2, ..., S_n}), then they play chess with each other. - If both are pingpong partners of X (both are in {P_1, P_2, ..., P_n}), then they play pingpong with each other. - If they are partners of X in different games (one in {T_1, T_2, ..., T_n}, another in {S_1, S_2, ..., S_n}, or {P_1, P_2, ..., P_n}), then they play the third game with each other (i.e., not tennis, not chess). 4. **Step 3 - Verification**: By following this assignment, we need to verify that each member indeed has exactly n partners for each game. - Consider T_1, one of X's tennis partners: - T_1 has X as a tennis partner. - T_1 will have T_2, T_3, ..., T_n as additional n-1 tennis partners (ensuring that T_1 has n tennis partners). - T_1 will have S_1, S_2, ..., S_n as chess partners (ensuring that T_1 has n chess partners). - T_1 will have P_1, P_2, ..., P_n as pingpong partners (ensuring that T_1 has n pingpong partners). By symmetric arguments, each member of the society follows the same pattern—each having n partners for tennis, n partners for chess, and n partners for pingpong. # Conclusion: Thus, we have arranged the sports activities such that the required condition (each member having exactly n partners for each game) is satisfied.

This can be transformed using the identity sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x), but more directly here, we'll use another approach involving the cosine function and the angle sum identity. 3. By recognizing that sin(2θ+frac{π}{6}) = cos(frac{π}{3}-2θ), we can apply the double angle formula for cosine, cos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x). Therefore, cos(2x) = cos 2(frac{π}{6}-θ) translates directly into an expression involving the known sine value. 4. Substitute sin(frac{π}{6}-θ) = -frac{1}{3} into the formula cos(2x) = 1 - 2sin^2(x) to get cos 2(frac{π}{6}-θ) = 1 - 2(-frac{1}{3})^2. 5.

Observe that points B_{1} and C_{1} lie on a circle with diameter AH.

Each color should appear in frac{binom{n}{2}}{n} = frac{n-1}{2} triangles. - This formula implies that every color class spans frac{n-1}{2} edges. 3. **Existence conditions for even and odd n**: - When n is even (n=2m), frac{n-1}{2} is not an integer, so a valid coloring is not possible. Hence, no such coloring exists for even n. - For odd n=2m+1, frac{n-1}{2} is an integer, so we explore this possibility further for valid colorgings. 4. **Constructing a valid coloring for odd n**: - Define the vertices of the n-gon, P, in a cyclic order, A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2m+1}. - Assign colors to the edges.

We need to find the minimum value of k that satisfies these conditions. 1. **Step 1:** Representing the vertices and edges: - Consider a vertex ( A ). Assign it the sequence of all zeros: ((0, 0, ldots, 0)). - For any vertex ( B ) different from ( A ), assign a sequence ((b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k)) where each ( b_i ) is defined as follows: - ( b_i = 0 ) if the edge ( AB ) is colored with color ( i ), - ( b_i = 1 ) if the edge ( AB ) is not colored with color ( i ). 2. **Step 2:** Consider vertex ( C ) different from ( A ) and ( B ). There are two cases for element ( i ) in the sequence associated with ( C ): - If ( c_i = b_i ), then color ( i ) is either present on both edges ( AB ) and ( AC ) or on neither. Since every color in the triangle ( ABC ) must appear an odd number of times (due to Condition 3), color ( i ) must also appear on edge ( BC ). - If ( c_i neq b_i ), then color ( i ) appears in exactly one of ( AB ) or ( AC ), meaning it does not appear in ( BC ). 3. **Step 3:** Using the sequences: - For condition 3 to hold for every triangle, color ( i ) appears on exactly one or three edges of ( ABC ). Thus, ( c_i = b_i ) for two of the vertices must imply ( a_i = 0 ), making one edge different in their assignment. - This means across any edges ( XY ), ( i )-th elements of their sequences are the same if and only if color ( i ) is present on edge ( XY ). 4. **Step 4:** Ensure sequences are distinct and not complements: - Condition 2 demands no two vertices can have the same sequence. - Condition 1 demands that no two vertices have sequences that are bitwise complements of each other. - Given ( k ) bit sequences, there are ( 2^k ) possible sequences, and because complements are forbidden, we consider half of these: ( 2^{k-1} ). 5. **Conclusion:** - We need at least ( 2^{k-1} ) unique sequences to ensure all ( n ) vertices are properly assigned: [ 2^{k-1} geq n ] - Rearranging for ( k ): [ k geq leftlceil log_2 n rightrceil + 1 ] Thus, the minimum number of colors ( k ) required to satisfy all given conditions is: [ boxed{leftlceil log_2 n rightrceil + 1} ]"},{"prompt":"a rectangular coordinate system, what is the number of units in the distance from the origin to the point (12, 5), and identify the type of triangle formed with this point, the origin, and the point (12, 0)?","completion":"We use the distance formula: [ sqrt{(12-0)^2 + (-5-0)^2} = sqrt{144 + 25} = sqrt{169} = boxed{13}. ] Next, consider the triangle formed by the points (0,0), (12,0), and (12, -5).

What is the minimum number of knights that could be among these 80 residents?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** There are 80 islanders, each wearing a uniquely numbered t-shirt (from 1 to 80). These islanders belong to two categories: - Knights, who always tell the truth. - Liars, who always lie. Each islander makes one of the following statements: - \\"Among us, there are at least 5 liars with a t-shirt number greater than mine.\\" - \\"Among us, there are at least 5 liars with a t-shirt number less than mine.\\" Our goal is to determine the minimum possible number of knights among the 80 islanders. 2. **Assumption and Initial Calculation:** Suppose there are at least 11 liars. We will prove that this leads to a contradiction. Let's arrange the islanders in ascending order of their t-shirt numbers. Let the liar with the 6th highest t-shirt number among the liars make his/her statement. Since they lie, their statement must be false. He must say: \\"There are at least 5 liars with a t-shirt number less than mine.\\" Since this statement is false, it means there are fewer than 5 liars with a t-shirt number less than his. This implies there must be fewer than 11 liars, as there can't be 5 liars before him. Therefore, the assumption of having at least 11 liars contradicts the lying behavior. Hence, the maximum possible number of liars is 10, meaning there are at least 80 - 10 = 70 knights. 3. **Example Construction:** Now, let’s demonstrate that having exactly 70 knights is feasible: - Knights wear t-shirts numbered from 1 to 70. - Liars wear t-shirts numbered from 71 to 80. Considering the statements: - Knights (with numbers 1 to 70) say whichever of their statements, they will be true. - Liars with t-shirt numbers 76 to 80 can state: \\"There are at least 5 liars with a t-shirt number greater than mine.\\" As there are exactly 5 liars with t-shirt numbers , 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, this statement is actually true when coming from a liar (hence a lie). This ensures these liars are consistent. - Liars with t-shirt numbers 71 to 75 can state: \\"There are at least 5 liars with a t-shirt number less than mine.\\" While there are exactly 5 liars with t-shirts 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, their statement should be false. Given there are not more than these 5, their statement should function as intended (lie). 4. **Conclusion:** From this construction, we see that it is possible to have exactly 70 knights and 10 liars, satisfying all conditions described.

In how many different ways is it possible to add somewhere on the boundary of this cube a 1times 1times 1 cube in such a way that the new shape can be filled in with 1times 1times k shapes, for some natural number k , kgeq 2 ?","completion":"1. **Define the Problem and Initial Setup:** We are given a cube of side length (2021). We need to determine the number of ways to add a (1 times 1 times 1) cube to the boundary of this cube such that the resulting shape can be filled with (1 times 1 times k) cuboids for some natural number (k geq 2). 2. **Partition the Cube:** Partition the (2021 times 2021 times 2021) cube into (2021^3) unit cubes. Assign to each unit cube with coordinates ((x, y, z)) the number (omega^{x+y+z}), where (omega) is a primitive (k)-th root of unity. This number is called the *value* of the unit cube. 3. **Symmetry and Value of the Solid:** Let ((a, b, c)) be the coordinates of the added unit cube. Note that if ((a, b, c)) is (k)-good, then ((2020-a, b, c)) is also (k)-good due to symmetry. 4. **Lemma on Value of Cuboids:** **Lemma:** The value of any (k times 1 times 1) cuboid is (0). *Proof:* Since (omega) is a (k)-th root of unity, if the coordinates of the cubes the cuboid consists of are ((m+i, n, p)) for (i in {0, 1, ldots, k-1}), then: [ sum_{i=0}^{k-1} omega^{m+i+n+p} = omega^{m+n+p} sum_{i=0}^{k-1} omega^i = 0, ] as desired. (blacksquare) 5. **Condition on (k):** **Claim:** (k mid 2022). *Proof:* The value of the whole (2021 times 2021 times 2021) cube is: [ left(sum_{i=0}^{2020} omega^iright)^3, ] and by our Lemma, we must have: [ left(sum_{i=0}^{2020} omega^iright)^3 = -omega^{a+b+c}. ] Note that: [ sum_{i=0}^{2020} omega^i = frac{1-omega^{2021}}{1-omega}, ] and since (|omega^{a+b+c}| = |omega|^{a+b+c} = 1), we must have (|1-omega^{2021}| = |1-omega|). 6. **Using De Moivre's Theorem:** Let (omega = cos frac{2pi}{k} + i sin frac{2pi}{k}). Then, using De Moivre's formula: [ |1-omega^{2021}| = |(1-cos frac{2021 cdot 2pi}{k}) + i sin frac{2021 cdot 2pi}{k}|, ] and: [ |1-omega| = |(1-cos frac{2pi}{k}) + i sin frac{2pi}{k}|. ] Therefore: [ (1-cos frac{2021 cdot 2pi}{k})^2 + (sin frac{2021 cdot 2pi}{k})^2 = (1-cos frac{2pi}{k})^2 + (sin frac{2pi}{k})^2, ] which simplifies to: [ cos frac{2021 cdot 2pi}{k} = cos frac{2pi}{k}. ] Thus: [ frac{2021 cdot 2pi}{k} = 2ellpi pm frac{2pi}{k}, ] for some integer (ell). Therefore: [ 2020 = ell k quad text{or} quad 2022 = ell k, ] and so (k mid 2020) or (k mid 2022). 7. **Divisibility Condition:** Note that (k) must divide (2021^3 + 1), the total number of unit cubes in the new solid. If (k mid 2020), then (k mid 2), and so (k mid 2). However, if (k mid 2), then trivially (k mid 2022). Thus, we may suppose that (k mid 2022). 8. **Sum of Roots of Unity:** Since (k mid 2022), we infer that: [ sum_{i=0}^{2021} omega^i = 0, ] and so: [ omega^{a+b+c} = -left(sum_{i=0}^{2020} omega^iright)^3 = omega^{3 cdot 2021}. ] Therefore: [ k mid (a+b+c) - 3 cdot 2021, ] and since (2021 equiv -1 pmod{k}), we obtain: [ a+b+c equiv -3 pmod{k}. ] 9. **Symmetry and Final Conditions:** Hence, if ((a, b, c)) is (k)-good, then (a+b+c equiv -3 pmod{k}). Since ((2020-a, b, c)) is (k)-good too, we obtain: [ 2020-a+b+c equiv -3 pmod{k}, ] and so: [ b+c-a equiv -1 pmod{k}, ] hence: [ 2a equiv -2 pmod{k}. ] 10. **Specific Cases for (k):** WLOG, assume the added unit cube is at the bottom of the initial cube, so (c = -1). Therefore: [ 2a equiv -2 pmod{k} quad text{and} quad b equiv a pmod{k}. ] Note that if a triple ((a, b, c)) is (k)-good, then it is also (p)-good for any prime (p mid k). Thus, it suffices to consider (k in {2, 3, 337}). 11. **Counting the Pairs:** For (k = 2), the conditions imply (a equiv b pmod{2}). For (k in {3, 337}), the conditions imply (a equiv b equiv -1 pmod{k}). 12. **Proof of Sufficiency:** - For (k = 2), if we remove the bottom (2021 times 2021 times 1) square of unit cubes plus the added cubelet, the remainder is a (2021 times 2021 times 2020) solid, which can be covered with (2 times 1 times 1) cuboids. The removed solid can be covered by placing a (2 times 1 times 1) cuboid covering the added unit cube and the cube exactly above it, leaving a (2021 times 2021) square with one unit square removed, which can be covered with (2 times 1) dominoes. - For (k in {3, 337}), we can use a similar construction, covering a (2021 times 2021 times (2022-k)) solid, then using a (k times 1 times 1) cuboid to cover the added unit cube and the (k-1) unit cubes above it, leaving (k-1) copies of a (2021 times 2021) square with one square removed, which can be covered as described before. 13. **Final Computation:** We need to count the number of pairs ((a, b)) such that (0 leq a, b leq 2020) and either (a equiv b pmod{2}), or (a equiv b equiv -1 pmod{3}), or (a equiv b equiv -1 pmod{337}).

Define three rotations: - mathcal{R}_M: a rotation of 120^circ centered at M; - mathcal{R}_N: a rotation of 120^circ centered at N; - mathcal{R}_P: a rotation of 120^circ centered at P. Note that 120^circ + 120^circ + 120^circ = 360^circ, so the composition of these three rotations is a translation (which, geometrically, can be understood as a rotation of 0^circ centered at infinity). 2. **Effect of the rotations:** Examine the effect of these rotations on points and sides of triangle ABC: - mathcal{R}_M sends B to C. - mathcal{R}_N sends C to A. - mathcal{R}_P sends A to B. The composition mathcal{R}_P circ mathcal{R}_N circ mathcal{R}_M must then send B to A, A to C, and C to B. Given that their combined effect results in an identical transformation, this sequence must collectively map B back to B. Therefore, the combination of these three rotations results in the identity transformation. 3. **Considering points M, N, and P during rotation:** - Point M is invariant under mathcal{R}_M because M is the center of this rotation. - Let M' = mathcal{R}_N(M). This means under the second rotation mathcal{R}_N, point M gets mapped to M'. - Since the composition of the three rotations is the identity, mathcal{R}_P(M') = M. Therefore, M', after a further rotation mathcal{R}_P, returns to M. 4. **Properties of triangles MNM' and M'PM:** By the definition of rotations: - triangle MNM' is isosceles with angle NMN' = 120^circ since N is the center of the rotation taking M to M'. - Similarly, triangle M'PM is isosceles with angle PNM' = 120^circ because P is the center of the rotation taking M' back to M. 5. **Symmetry and equilateral triangle conclusion:** Since both triangles MNM' and M'PM have 120^circ angles at N and P, respectively, the perpendicular bisector of MM' serves as the symmetry axis and angle bisector of angle MNM' and angle M'PM.

Hence, segments must end at an interior node. 3. **Estimate the Minimum Number of Triangles:** - Suppose there is at least one interior node, denoted as A. From A, at least 5 edges must extend because the full angle around A must be divided into acute angles. - Not all of these edges can end at square vertices. One edge must terminate at another interior node or an interior point of a side. 4. **Necessity of a Second Interior Node:** - If there were no other interior nodes, we would need a node on a side of the square. A segment starting from this node would create an additional segment initiating new nodes to keep the divisions into acute angles. 5. **Minimum Interior Nodes and Triangles:** - Two interior nodes are necessary. Each of these must connect to at least 5 triangle vertices. - This results in at least 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 triangles (since not all edges can be shared). 6. **Proving the Existence of an 8-Triangle Division:** - Construct a diagram that divides the square into 8 acute triangles (shown via Thales circles and appropriate intersection points). 7. **Graph Theory Approach:** - Suppose the division has a nodes on the sides and b interior nodes. - Total vertices c = 4 + a + b (including square corners). - Total edges e must be calculated knowing the triangular division. - Applying Euler's formula for planar graphs (c + ell = e + 1 where ell is the number of regions and ell = e + 1 - c). 8. **Verification:** - With triangles (ell) yielding 2e = 3 ell + 4 + a. - For triangulation with acute angles, necessary conditions enforce that 2e geq 4(3) + a(4) + b(5) must be met. - Simplify to show that b geq 2, confirming two interior nodes. 9. **Conclusion:** - At least 8 triangles form when complying with constraints to ensure all triangles have acute angles.

According to the problem, the area covered only by the left strip is 27, and the area covered only by the right strip is 18. 3.

The goal is to flip the 12 cards such that all of them are face down, leaving exactly one card face up. 3. **Avoiding Deadlocks:** We need to ensure that we never reach a position where fewer than two cards are left face up as the process continues. This is critically important as it means our strategy should be systematic to avoid such deadlocks. 4. **Flipping Strategy:** For the first card flip, which can be any from 13 choices, each subsequent flip allows for two possibilities - either a clockwise or a counterclockwise adjacent card being flipped. 5. **Combinatorial Counting:** Given the constraint of selecting between two options (clockwise or counterclockwise) for each step after the first card flip: - There are 13 initial choices for the first card to flip. - Each subsequent card flip (of which there are 11 more to reach a situation where exactly one card remains face up) has 2 possibilities (clockwise or counterclockwise). 6.

Thus, the final configuration as described is impossible to achieve. (boxed{text{No}})"},{"prompt":"A cup is filled with a salt solution at a concentration of 15%.

When the small ball is submerged, 10% of ( V ) overflows. Thus, the overflow volume due to the small ball is ( 0.1V ). 3. **Determine Volume of Each Ball**: - Given the volume ratios, let the volume of the large ball be ( 10x ), the medium ball be ( 5x ), and the small ball be ( 3x ). 4. **Relate Overflow to Ball Volumes**: - According to the problem, the small ball's volume ( 3x ) matches the 10% overflow, giving ( 3x = 0.1V ). Solving this, we find ( V = 30x ). 5. **Calculate Total Overflow**: - When the small ball is submerged, the overflow is ( 3x = 0.1V = 0.1 times 30x = 3x ). - Next, we submerge the medium ball. Its volume causes an overflow of ( 5x ). - Finally, submerging the large ball causes an overflow of ( 10x ). 6. **Total Volume Exclusion**: - After all submersion operations, the total volume overflowed equals: [ 3x + 5x + 10x = 18x ] 7. **Adjust Volume of Remaining Saltwater**: - Initially, the total saltwater volume is ( 30x ). - The remaining volume after all overflows is: [ 30x - 18x = 12x ] 8. **Calculate Final Concentration**: - The initial salt concentration was 15%, and the initial volume of salt is: [ 0.15 times 30x = 4.5x ] - After the overflows, we pour pure water to refill it back to ( 30x ) volume. Therefore, the concentrated salt remains ( 4.5x ) in the new volume ( 30x ). 9. **Determine Final Salt Concentration**: - Final concentration: [ frac{4.5x}{30x} = frac{4.5}{30} = 0.15 = 15 % ] - Therefore, the final concentration of the saltwater in the cup is: [ boxed{10 %} ] This detailed calculation provides a precise understanding of the transformations leading to the final concentration after all specified operations."},{"prompt":"A circle with its center on the line y=x, and tangent to the line y=1+2x at the point M(1,1), has the standard equation ______.","completion":"Given that the center of the circle lies on the line y=-x, we can denote the coordinates of the center as (a,-a). The circle is also tangent to the line y=1+2x at the point M(-1,-1). To find the radius of the circle, which is the distance from the center (a,-a) to the point of tangency M(-1,-1), we use the distance formula. Simultaneously, we also know that the perpendicular distance from the center to the tangent line y=1+2x must equal this radius for the circle to be tangent to the line at M. The distance d from the center (a,-a) to the line y=1+2x can be calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line: [d = frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}] where Ax + By + C = 0 is the standard form of the line equation, and (x_1, y_1) are the coordinates of the point. For the line y=1+2x, we can rewrite it as -2x + y - 1 = 0, thus A=-2, B=1, and C=-1. Plugging in the coordinates of the center (a,-a), we get: [d = frac{|-2a + (-a) - 1|}{sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|-3a - 1|}{sqrt{5}}] The distance from the center to M using the distance formula is: [d = sqrt{(a+1)^2 + (-a+1)^2}] Equating the two expressions for d, we have: [frac{|-3a - 1|}{sqrt{5}} = sqrt{(a+1)^2 + (-a+1)^2}] Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root and simplify, we get: [frac{(-3a - 1)^2}{5} = (a+1)^2 + (-a+1)^2] Solving this equation for a, we find that a=3.

Kids wearing only socks = Total kids wearing socks - Kids wearing both socks and shoes Kids wearing only socks = 12 - 6 Kids wearing only socks = 6 Kids wearing only shoes = Total kids wearing shoes - Kids wearing both socks and shoes Kids wearing only shoes = 8 - 6 Kids wearing only shoes = 2 Now, let's add the number of kids wearing only socks to the number of kids wearing only shoes, and then add the number of kids wearing both to find out how many kids are wearing some form of footwear. Total kids with footwear = Kids wearing only socks + Kids wearing only shoes + Kids wearing both Total kids with footwear = 6 + 2 + 6 Total kids with footwear = 14 Finally, we subtract the number of kids with footwear from the total number of kids in the classroom to find out how many are barefoot.

To start, we can employ a useful trigonometric identity related to the cosines of angles separated by (frac{2 pi}{3}). 1. **Express each term in simpler form using trigonometric identities:** Recall the identity for cosines of angles separated by (frac{2pi}{3}): cos (alpha + frac{2pi}{3}) = -frac{1}{2} cos alpha - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin alpha and cos (alpha - frac{2pi}{3}) = -frac{1}{2} cos alpha + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin alpha. 2. **Cube each cosine term:** We first need to cube the cosine terms using the identity for powers of a sum.

We use the fact from trigonometric sum formulas for evenly spaced angles. 4. **Simplify using the symmetry property:** Since we determined that (a + b + c = 0), cos^3 alpha + cos^3 left(alpha + frac{2pi}{3}right) + cos^3 left(alpha - frac{2pi}{3}right) = 3cos alpha cos left(alpha+frac{2pi}{3}right) cos left(alpha-frac{2pi}{3}right). 5. **Calculate the triple product of cosines:** Let's calculate (cos alpha cos (alpha + frac{2pi}{3}) cos (alpha - frac{2pi}{3})): cos left(alpha + frac{2pi}{3}right) = -frac{1}{2} cos alpha - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin alpha, cos left(alpha - frac{2pi}{3}right) = -frac{1}{2} cos alpha + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin alpha. The product is: cos alpha left(-frac{1}{2} cos alpha - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin alpha right) left(-frac{1}{2} cos alpha + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin alpha right). 6. **Combine terms and simplify:** Use the product of these cosines: = cos alpha left(-frac{1}{4} (cos^2 alpha - 3 sin^2 alpha) right) = -frac{1}{4} cos alpha (cos^2 alpha - 3 (1 - cos^2 alpha)) = -frac{1}{4} cos alpha(4 cos^2 alpha - 3). 7. **Connect back to ( cos 3alpha ):** Recall: cos 3alpha = 4cos^3 alpha - 3 cos alpha. Thus, -frac{1}{4} cos alpha (4 cos^2 alpha - 3) = frac{3}{4} cos 3 alpha.

We can express the weekly sales volume y as a function of the selling price per unit x (in yuan) as follows: 1. Let the increase in price from 90 yuan be x - 90. 2. For every 1 yuan increase, the number of shirts sold decreases by 10, so the decrease in shirts sold is 10 times (x - 90). 3. Therefore, the function expressing the relationship between y and x is y = 600 - 10 times (x - 90). Simplifying the expression: [ y = 600 - 10x + 900 = -10x + 1500 ] Thus, the function expression is: [ boxed{y = -10x + 1500} ] Part 2: Setting the Selling Price for a Weekly Profit of 8250 To achieve a weekly profit of 8250, we use the profit formula: [ text{Profit} = (x - 80)(-10x + 1500) ] Setting the profit to 8250: [ (x - 80)(-10x + 1500) = 8250 ] Solving this equation: 1. Expand and rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation. 2. Solve the quadratic equation to find the values of x. The solutions are x_1 = 95 and x_2 = 135. Since x_2 = 135 is not feasible (the selling price must not be less than 90 yuan and not exceed 110 yuan), we discard it. Therefore, the selling price should be set at: [ boxed{95 text{ yuan}} ] Part 3: Maximizing Weekly Sales Profit To maximize the weekly sales profit without exceeding a selling price of 110 yuan, we express the profit w as: [ w = (x - 80)(-10x + 1500) = -10(x - 115)^2 + 12250 ] Given that -10 < 0, the profit function opens downwards, indicating a maximum value at the vertex of the parabola. Since the selling price must not exceed 110 yuan, we find the maximum profit when x = 110: [ w_{text{max}} = -10(110 - 115)^2 + 12250 = 12000 ] Thus, to maximize the weekly sales profit: [ boxed{text{The selling price is } 110 text{ yuan, and the maximum profit is } 12000 text{ yuan.}} ]"},{"prompt":"57°cos27°cos57°sin27°=（ ） A: frac {1}{2} B: frac {1}{3} C: frac { sqrt {3}}{2} D: frac { sqrt {3}}{3}","completion":"The solution is as follows: sin57°cos27°-cos57°sin27°=sin（57°-27°）=sin30° = boxed{frac {1}{2}}.

Assume we have two adjacent cards ( A ) and ( B ), where ( A ) is immediately clockwise from ( B ). Assign the number 1 to all cards except ( B ), which is assigned the number 2. 3. **Operation Analysis**: - If Vasya removes any card other than ( A ) first, he will continue removing cards in a clockwise manner. - When he reaches ( B ), the number 2 on ( B ) will cause him to skip ( A ) and continue removing the next card. - This skipping ensures that ( A ) is never removed until all other cards are removed. 4. **Ensuring Distinct Numbers**: To satisfy the condition that all numbers on the cards are distinct, we can add distinct multiples of ( 1000! ) to each card. This ensures that: - The relative order of removal remains unchanged because adding multiples of ( 1000! ) does not affect the counting process modulo 1000. - Each card will have a unique number since ( 1000! ) is a very large number, and adding distinct multiples of it will ensure distinctness. 5. **Conclusion**: By assigning numbers in this manner, we ensure that card ( A ) will always be the last remaining card, regardless of which card Vasya starts with.

Let's break down this problem step-by-step. 1. **Visualizing the Hexagons**: - Consider a regular hexagon with side length ( s ). - Within this hexagon, cut out a smaller, concentric hexagon whose side length is ( frac{s}{2} ). 2. **Calculation of Areas**: - The area of a regular hexagon with side length ( a ) is given by the formula: [ A = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} a^2 ] - For the larger hexagon (side length ( s )): [ A_{text{large}} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 ] - For the smaller hexagon (side length ( frac{s}{2} )): [ A_{text{small}} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} left( frac{s}{2} right)^2 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{s^2}{4} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} s^2 ] - The area of the annular region is then: [ A_{text{annulus}} = A_{text{large}} - A_{text{small}} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 - frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} s^2 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} times 3 s^2 = frac{9sqrt{3}}{8} s^2 ] 3. **Cutting the Annular Shape**: - Divide the annular region into pieces that can be reassembled into a regular hexagon. - One method for achieving this is to cut the annular shape into 6 identical rhombuses. Each rhombus can then be rearranged to form a regular hexagon. 4. **Forming the Rhombuses**: - Cut the outer hexagon along lines connecting each vertex of the outer hexagon to the corresponding vertex of the smaller, inner hexagon. - This can be achieved by drawing lines from each vertex of the outer hexagon to the closest vertex of the inner hexagon. - This results in 6 identical rhombuses, each having angles of ( 120^circ ) and ( 60^circ ). 5. **Reassembling the Pieces**: - Take these identical rhombuses and rearrange them to form a new regular hexagon. - Since the rhombuses are identical and each pair of adjacent rhombuses fits perfectly along a side, they form a regular hexagon. # Conclusion: Therefore, the method to cut the annular region formed by the outer and inner hexagons is to draw lines connecting the vertices of the inner and outer hexagons, producing 6 identical rhombuses that can be rearranged to form a regular hexagon. boxed{text{Use 6 identical rhombuses to form a regular hexagon.}}"},{"prompt":"The minimum value of the function f(x)=x2sin x on the interval left[0,pi right] is A: 0 B: pi C: frac{π}{3}sqrt{3} D: frac{π}{6}1","completion":"To find the minimum value of the function f(x)=x-2sin x on the interval left[0,pi right], we first compute its derivative to understand its behavior. The derivative of f(x) is given by: [f'(x)=frac{d}{dx}(x-2sin x)=1-2cos x.] We analyze the sign of f'(x) to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing: 1. For xin [0,frac{π}{3}), we have cos x > frac{1}{2}, which implies 1-2cos x < 0. Therefore, f'(x) < 0 and the function is decreasing in this interval. 2. For xin (frac{π}{3},pi], we have cos x < frac{1}{2}, which implies 1-2cos x > 0. Therefore, f'(x) > 0 and the function is increasing in this interval.

We start with the equation given in the problem: [ N + 25 = M^2 ] This implies: [ N = M^2 - 25 = (M+5)(M-5) ] Since (N) has only prime divisors 2 and 5, both (M+5) and (M-5) must be products of powers of 2 and 5. 2. Consider the case where (5 nmid M). In this case, both (M+5) and (M-5) must be powers of 2. However, the difference between two powers of 2 is never 10 (since (M+5 - (M-5) = 10)). Therefore, (5 mid M). 3. Let (M = 5K). Then: [ N = (5K+5)(5K-5) = 25(K+1)(K-1) ] Since (N) has only prime divisors 2 and 5, ((K+1)(K-1)) must also be a product of powers of 2 and 5. 4. Consider the case where (5 nmid (K+1)(K-1)). This implies that both (K+1) and (K-1) are powers of 2. Let (K-1 = 2^a) and (K+1 = 2^b) with (b > a). Then: [ 2^b - 2^a = 2 ] This simplifies to: [ 2^a(2^{b-a} - 1) = 2 ] Since (2^a) must be a power of 2, (a = 1) and (2^{b-a} - 1 = 1), so (b-a = 1). Therefore, (a = 1) and (b = 2), giving (K-1 = 2) and (K+1 = 4), so (K = 3). Thus: [ N = 25(K+1)(K-1) = 25 cdot 4 cdot 2 = 200 ] 5. Now consider the case where (5 mid (K+1)(K-1)). We have two subcases: - (5 mid K+1): Let (K+1 = 5m). Then (K-1 = 5m - 2). Since (K-1) is a power of 2, let (K-1 = 2^a). Then: [ 5m - 2 = 2^a ] and: [ K+1 = 5m ] Substituting (K = 5m - 1), we get: [ 5m - 1 - 1 = 2^a implies 5m - 2 = 2^a ] Since (5m - 2) is a power of 2, let (5m - 2 = 2^a). Then: [ 5m = 2^a + 2 ] For (a = 3), (2^a + 2 = 10), so (m = 2). Thus (K = 9), and: [ N = 25(K+1)(K-1) = 25 cdot 10 cdot 8 = 2000 ] - (5 mid K-1): Let (K-1 = 5n). Then (K+1 = 5n + 2).

Then: [ 5n + 2 = 2^b ] and: [ K-1 = 5n ] Substituting (K = 5n + 1), we get: [ 5n + 1 + 1 = 2^b implies 5n + 2 = 2^b ] Since (5n + 2) is a power of 2, let (5n + 2 = 2^b).

Calculate the number of equilateral triangles that can be formed such that their three vertices are vertices of the cube.","completion":"To determine the number of equilateral triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a cube, we need to identify the possible side lengths of such triangles and count how many triangles can be constructed with each possible side length. Here are the detailed steps: 1. **Identify Possible Distances Between Vertices:** In a cube, there are three distinct possible distances between any two vertices: [ AB = ell, quad AR = ell sqrt{2}, quad text{and} quad PD = ell sqrt{3} ] 2. **Examine Triangles with Side Length (ell):** If an equilateral triangle has a side length of (ell), each side must coincide with an edge of the cube. However, in a cube, any two edges that meet at a vertex are always perpendicular, and hence cannot form an equilateral triangle with three equal ( ell )-length sides. Thus, there are no equilateral triangles with side length (ell). 3. **Examine Triangles with Side Length (ell sqrt{3}):** The pairs of vertices that are (ell sqrt{3}) apart are: [ {A, Q}, {B, R}, {S, C}, {P, D} ] Each pair of vertices (ell sqrt{3}) apart are on opposite corners of the cube. To form an equilateral triangle, we need three vertices that are mutually (ell sqrt{3}) apart. As there are no two (ell sqrt{3}) pairs sharing a common vertex, it is impossible to form an equilateral triangle of this side length. Thus, there are no equilateral triangles with side length (ell sqrt{3}). 4. **Examine Triangles with Side Length (ell sqrt{2}):** We now check the feasibility of forming equilateral triangles with side length (ell sqrt{2}). Consider a vertex, e.g., (A). The vertices (ell sqrt{2}) away from (A) are (P), (R), and (C). These vertices form a set of 3 potential pairs: [ {(A, P, R), (A, P, C), (A, R, C)} ] Therefore, from vertex (A), there are 3 such triangles. Since this scenario is symmetric for each vertex of the cube, and each vertex forms similar sets of equilateral triangles: [ text{Total triangles} = text{Number of vertices} times text{Triangles per vertex} = 8 times 3 = 24 ] However, each triangle is counted three times (once at each vertex of the triangle). Thus, to find the distinct number of triangles, we divide by 3: [ text{Distinct equilateral triangles} = frac{8 times 3}{3} = 8 ] 5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the number of equilateral triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a cube and having a side length of (ell sqrt{2}) is: [ boxed{8} ]"},{"prompt":"The probability of getting rain on any given day in July in Rivertown is frac{1}{5}.

Raising 4 to the power of both sides to remove the logarithm: 4^{frac{y}{2}} - 2 leq 4^{frac{1}{2}}. Simplifying further: 4^{frac{y}{2}} - 2 leq 2. Add 2 to both sides: 4^{frac{y}{2}} leq 4. Since the base is positive and less than 4: frac{y}{2} leq 1. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: y leq 2. Now, since y = f(x) and by definition of the inverse function, the variable on the left should be x: x leq 2. Additionally, it's important to notice that because f(x) = log_2(4^x + 2) maps real numbers to real numbers and 4^x + 2 > 1 for all x: x > 1. Combining the two conditions, we have: 1 < x leq 2.

This strategy ensures that the magician can identify the five additional coins in their correct state, even though the assistant cannot communicate directly to the magician when he enters. 3. **Step 3: Divide the Problem into Smaller Parts** - Divide the 27 coins into 9 groups of 3 coins each (a triplet). [ 27 text{ coins} = 9 times 3 text{ triplets} ] 4. **Step 4: Analyze the Distribution of Coin States Within Triplets** - In each triplet, there will be a mixture of heads and tails.

The assistant will then leave one coin uncovered from each of these five triplets which predominantly show heads. - Example configuration where heads dominate: - ( {H, H, T} ) - covering any of (H,H) - ( {H, T, H} ) - covering any of (H,H) - and so on for five triplets. 6. **Step 6: The Determined Communication** - The trick lies in how the assistant decides which specific coin in each triplet to leave uncovered: - Define a rule. For instance, if the leftmost two coins in a triplet are heads, the assistant uncovers the left coin. This specific pattern will inform the magician about the positioning of heads within that triplet. - Possible rules for assistant: - Two leftmost heads: uncover the leftmost coin. - Two rightmost heads: uncover the middle coin. - Left and right heads: uncover the rightmost coin. - These rules allow the magician to infer the specific hidden heads coins in the other triplets based on the position of the uncovered coin. 7. **Step 7: The Magician’s Task** - When the magician enters, he sees the five uncovered coins and remembers the agreed pattern. - With the predetermined pattern, the magician deciphers the exact combination of heads positions in each triplet and thus guesses correctly which other five coins (still covered) will show heads. # Conclusion This combination and hidden message deciphering complete the focus trick successfully.

The number of ways to choose these four cards is: [ 63 times 62 times 61 times 60 ] 3. **Determining the Fifth Card**: To complete the selection ensuring that each dot appears an even number of times, the fifth card must be such that it balances out the dots appearing in even quantities. 4. **Counting Specific Cases**: - **Case 1: The Fifth Card Makes Each Dot Even Without Causing Duplicates or Emptiness**: This would typically just be the remaining card that ensures each dot appears an even number of times. - **Case 2: The Fifth Card is Empty**: For the fifth card to be effectively empty, the first four cards already need to balance out each dot to appear an even number of times. The calculation: [ 63 times 62 times 60 ] This counts how many ways to pick two cards, avoid one, and pick the third card ensuring even counts without the fourth balancing out. - **Case 3: The Fifth Card is a Duplicate Within the First Four**: This means one of the four cards is chosen again as the fifth card. This involves first selecting three cards that create such an even condition: [ text{Number of ways to choose 2 cards} = 63 times 62 ] - We pick slots for a duplicate: (4) ways. - Choosing the duplicate: (60) remaining cards for the duplicate. The total for this step: [ 63 times 62 times 4 times 60 ] 5. **Total Combinations and Adjusting for Overcounts**: We subtract the cases where the fifth card is empty or a duplicate: [ 63 times 62 times 61 times 60 - 63 times 62 times 60 - 63 times 62 times 4 times 60 ] 6. **Final Calculation**: Now, for the valid ordered combinations, we divide by the fact that order does not matter in selection of five cards. Hence, we divide by (5!) or (120): [ frac{63 times 62 times 61 times 60 - 63 times 62 times 60 - 63 times 62 times 4 times 60}{120} ] 7. **Simplify**: [ frac{63 times 62 times (61 - 1 - 4)}{2} = frac{63 times 62 times 56}{2} = 63 times 31 times 56 ] 8. **Final Multiplication to Get the Answer**: [ 63 times 31 times 56 = 109368 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{109368} ]"},{"prompt":"f x is 75 percent greater than 150, then x =","completion":"To find x, which is 75 percent greater than 150, you can calculate it as follows: First, find 75 percent of 150: 75% of 150 = 0.75 * 150 = 112.5 Then, add this value to the original 150 to find x: x = 150 + 112.5 = 262.5 So, x = boxed{262.5}"},{"prompt":"Let ( A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}, A_{2}B_{2}C_{2} ), and ( A_{3}B_{3}C_{3} ) be three triangles in the plane.

Choose an appropriate coordinate system and find the equation of the line describing the road in this coordinate system; determine the type of the line.","completion":"1. **Set Up the Coordinate System:** Let's choose a rectangular coordinate system, ( XOY ). Place the concrete slab factory at the origin ( O ) of this coordinate system, and let the ( OX ) axis run along the power transmission line (PTL). By setting this up as follows, we simplify the calculations: the PTL corresponds to the line ( y = d ) if the distance between the factory and the PTL is ( d ). 2. **Distance Calculations:** Consider an arbitrary point ( M(x, y) ) on the road that we are constructing. The distance from ( M ) to the factory, ( O ), is given by: [ MO = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} ] The distance from ( M ) to the PTL (the line ( y = d )) is: [ d_{PTL} = |y - d| ] 3. **Equating the Distances:** For the road to be equidistant from the factory and the PTL, these two distances must be equal: [ sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = |y - d| ] To simplify the problem, we square both sides: [ (sqrt{x^2 + y^2})^2 = (|y - d|)^2 ] This yields: [ x^2 + y^2 = (y - d)^2 ] 4. **Expand and Simplify:** We expand the right-hand side equation: [ x^2 + y^2 = y^2 - 2dy + d^2 ] Next, we remove the ( y^2 ) terms: [ x^2 = d^2 - 2dy ] Solving for ( y ), we rearrange the equation: [ x^2 + 2dy = d^2 ] [ 2dy = d^2 - x^2 ] [ y = frac{d^2 - x^2}{2d} ] This can be more compactly written as: [ y = frac{d}{2} - frac{x^2}{2d} ] 5. **Conclusion:** This equation represents a parabola.

We need to prove that this set can be divided into three parts such that the diameter of each part does not exceed 1. 1. **Case 1: The diameter of ( S ) is at least ( sqrt{3} ).** Let ( A ) and ( B ) be points in ( S ) such that ( AB geq sqrt{3} ). Consider the unit circles ( omega_A ) and ( omega_B ) centered at ( A ) and ( B ), respectively. Let ( omega ) denote the (closed) intersection of ( omega_A ) and ( omega_B ). Since ( AB geq sqrt{3} ), the region ( omega ) is either empty or has a diameter at most 1. We claim that all points of ( S ) in ( omega_A setminus omega ) have a diameter at most 1. Suppose not, then there exist points ( P_1, P_2 in (omega_A setminus omega) cap S ) such that ( P_1P_2 > 1 ). This would mean that ( P_1, P_2, B ) form a set of three points where the distance between ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) exceeds 1, contradicting the given condition. Similarly, the points in ( S cap (omega_B setminus omega) ) also have a diameter at most 1. Therefore, we can partition ( S ) into three parts: ( S cap (omega_A setminus omega) ), ( S cap (omega_B setminus omega) ), and ( S cap omega ), each with a diameter at most 1. 2. **Case 2: The diameter of ( S ) is at most ( sqrt{3} ).** For any three points ( A, B, C ) in ( S ) such that ( AB, BC, CA leq sqrt{3} ), there exists a unit circle covering ( triangle ABC ). This can be shown by considering whether ( triangle ABC ) is acute or obtuse. If acute, the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) will suffice. If obtuse, the circle with the longest side of ( triangle ABC ) as its diameter will suffice. By Helly's Theorem, the set of unit circles centered at the points in ( S ) all have a common point, say ( P ). This implies that the entire set ( S ) is contained within the unit circle centered at ( P ). Let ( Q in S ) be the point furthest from ( P ), and let ( PQ = r leq 1 ). Let ( omega_P ) denote the circle centered at ( P ) with radius ( r ); note that ( S subset omega_P ). Let ( omega_Q ) denote the unit circle centered at ( Q ). The set of points in ( S ) contained in ( omega_P setminus omega_Q ) has a diameter at most 1, as otherwise, we would have a contradiction with two points being more than 1 unit apart from ( Q ). Finally, the region ( omega_P cap omega_Q ) can be split into two sets of diameter at most 1 by bisecting it along the line ( PQ ). Thus, we can partition ( S ) into three parts, each with a diameter at most 1. Since we have covered all possible cases, the proof is complete.

To Prove: - If we can form a triangle with any three consecutive sticks. - We can also form a triangle using sticks of the same color. # Steps: 1. **Label the Sticks:** Let's denote the 6 sticks as (a, b, c, d, e, f), and for simplicity, assume: - (a, c,) and (e) are blue. - (b, d,) and (f) are yellow. 2. **Length Representation:** The lengths of the sticks are also denoted by the same letters: (a, b, c, d, e, f). 3. **Assume Arrangement:** Suppose the largest blue stick is (a) and the largest yellow stick is adjacent to it, let that be (b). 4. **Condition for a Triangle using Alternating Sticks:** By assumption, since alternating sticks form a valid triangle, we have: [ d + c > b ] 5. **Proof by Contradiction:** Assume that we cannot form a triangle with all yellow sticks. Thus, we would need: [ b > d + f ] 6. **Comparison of Stick Lengths:** If (a) is the largest blue stick and the above inequality holds, (c > f). Given that sticks alternate in colors and form triangles: [ e + f > a ] and since (c > f): [ e + c > a ] 7. **Conclusion:** From the above reasoning, (e) and (c) together exceed (a), satisfying the triangle inequality for blue sticks. Hence, we can form a triangle using the blue sticks. To extend the argument: Suppose the largest yellow stick does not lie adjacent to (a) but rather, let it be (d). Then the inequalities: [ b + f > a ] and [ a geq d ] lead us to the conclusion that the triangle inequalities for (b, f,) and (d) (yellow sticks) are satisfied: [ b + f > d ] Therefore the triangle formation condition is met for the yellow sticks too: [ b + f > d ] Thus, we've shown both blue and yellow sticks can form triangles.

Let's call this amount \\"x.\\" The fee is 10% of x, so the amount Darrel receives is 90% of x, which is 27.

This can be done in {C}_{5}^{2} ways. The combination formula is used here because the order in which we select the volunteers for the group does not matter. 3. **Calculating {C}_{5}^{2}**: The formula for combinations is {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}. Applying this formula, we get {C}_{5}^{2} = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10 ways. 4. **Arranging the Groups**: After forming the first group, we are left with 4 groups (including the first group and the remaining 3 volunteers, each considered as a separate group). These 4 groups need to be assigned to the 4 projects. This can be done in {A}_{4}^{4} ways, where {A}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}. Since r = n in this case, {A}_{4}^{4} = 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24 ways. The arrangement formula is used here because the order in which we assign the groups to the projects matters. 5. **Calculating the Total Number of Ways**: To find the total number of allocation schemes, we multiply the number of ways to form the first group by the number of ways to arrange the groups among the projects. This gives us 10 times 24 = 240 ways. Therefore, the total number of different allocation schemes is boxed{240} ways, which corresponds to option C."},{"prompt":"Determine the smallest possible perimeter of a scalene triangle where: 1.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Setting Up the Problem:** Let the cardinality of set X be n, i.e., |X| = n. 2. **Assuming Contradiction:** Assume there exists an A_i in triangle where all elements are of the same color. Since A_i is an r-element subset of X, every element of A_i would either be all red or all black. 3. **Counting Possible Colorings:** There are 2^n possible ways to color the set X, as each element in X can be either red or black independently. 4. **Bounding the Same Color Subsets:** The expected number of r-element subsets A_i that are monochromatic (all red or all black) can be bounded. Note that there are precisely 2 times 2^{n-1} = 2^n ways to color the set X such that a specific r-element subset A_i is monochromatic: either A_i is entirely red or entirely black. 5. **Using the Given Constraint:** The provided constraint t leq 2^{-1} implies that t is very small, essentially tending to zero for large n. 6. **Ensuring Non-Monochromatic Sets:** Given there are 2^n total coloring ways and each A_i would be counted twice in the monochromatic case (once for all red, once for all black), the probability of each A_i being monochromatic is extremely small. 7. **Conclusion Based on Coloring:** Since there are 2^n ways to color the set X and not all colorings can ensure that all subsets A_i are monochromatic (due to the bound t leq 2^{-1} being strictly stringent), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must exist a coloring in which each A_i is not monochromatic.

To solve this, let's follow these detailed steps: 1. **Starting Assumption**: Assume there exists an appropriate point (P) inside the quadrilateral such that the areas of triangles (ABP), (BCP), (CDP), and (DAP) are all equal. This implies: [ t_{ABP} = t_{BCP} = t_{CDP} = t_{DAP} ] 2. **Equal Areas and Distance Properties**: From ( t_{ABP} = t_{DAP} ), it follows that the line (AP) is equidistant from points (B) and (D). Hence, line (AP) bisects the diagonal (BD), such that (AP) intersects the midpoint of (BD). This also implies: [ BM_1 = DM_2 ] Therefore, the right-angle triangles (BM_1F) and (DM_2F) are congruent, indicating that: [ BF = DF ] Hence, (AP) bisects the diagonal (BD). Similarly, from ( t_{BCP} = t_{CDP} ), the line (CP) also bisects diagonal (BD). 3. **Intersection Point of (AP) and (CP)**: Assuming (AP) and (CP) intersect at a single point, this point must be the midpoint of diagonal (BD). Therefore, point (P) is the midpoint of (BD). 4. **Distances to Midpoint**: Due to the equal area criteria ( t_{ABP} = t_{BCP} ) and ( t_{ADP} = t_{CDP} ), the lines (BP) and (DP) are equidistant from points (A) and (C) respectively. Since (B), (P), and (D) are collinear, the line (BD) must be equidistant from (A) and (C), which implies that (BD) bisects segment (AC). 5. **Conclusion for Diagonal Bisectors**: Therefore, if there exists a point (P) such that all four triangle areas are equal, then one of the quadrilateral's diagonals must bisect the other. 6. **Reverse Situation**: Conversely, if one diagonal bisects the other in the quadrilateral, we can use the midpoint of the non-bisected diagonal as (P), ensuring the triangles (ABP), (BCP), (CDP), and (DAP) have equal areas. Due to the equal segments and heights, the quadrilateral satisfied the equal area condition (as described using Figure 2). 7. **Proof Through Trigonometry**: Considering the trigonometric identities for the sine of the angles involved, we have: [ ab sin alpha = bc sin beta = cd sin gamma = da sin delta ] [ sin alpha sin gamma = sin beta sin delta ] By using product-to-sum formulas of sines, we obtain: [ sin alpha sin gamma = frac{cos(alpha - gamma) - cos(alpha + gamma)}{2} ] [ sin beta sin delta = frac{cos(beta - delta) - cos(beta + delta)}{2} ] Therefore: [ frac{sin alpha sin gamma}{sin beta sin delta} = frac{cos (alpha - gamma) - cos (alpha + gamma)}{cos (beta - delta) - cos (beta + delta)} = 1 ] Knowing that (alpha + beta + gamma + delta = 360^circ), we derive: [ cos (alpha + gamma) = cos (beta + delta) ] Since (cos (x)) is an even function: [ cos (alpha - gamma) = cos (beta - delta) ] Hence: [ alpha - gamma = beta - delta quad text{or} quad alpha - gamma = delta - beta ] Assume (alpha - gamma = beta - delta), this returns: [ alpha + delta = beta + gamma = 180^circ ] Events we computed induce the conclusion as inspected in Figure 4.

We are given that: 1. The batsman's batting average is 62 runs, so ( T = 62n ). 2. The difference between his highest and lowest score is 150 runs, so ( H - L = 150 ). 3. His average excluding the two innings with the highest and lowest scores is 58 runs. If we remove these two innings, the number of innings becomes ( n - 2 ), and the total runs scored in these innings is ( T - H - L ). Therefore, the average for these innings is ( frac{T - H - L}{n - 2} = 58 ). 4. His highest score is 225 runs, so ( H = 225 ). Now, let's use these equations to find the number of innings ( n ). From equation 2, we know that ( L = H - 150 ), so ( L = 225 - 150 = 75 ). From equation 3, we can express the total runs scored in the ( n - 2 ) innings as: ( T - H - L = 58(n - 2) ). Substituting ( T = 62n ), ( H = 225 ), and ( L = 75 ) into the equation, we get: ( 62n - 225 - 75 = 58(n - 2) ). Simplifying the equation: ( 62n - 300 = 58n - 116 ).

First, we convert the reduced speed from km/hr to m/s: Reduced speed of train in tunnel = 60 km/hr = 60 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 16.6667 m/s (approximately) The time taken for the train to pass through the tunnel is the length of the train plus the length of the tunnel divided by the reduced speed: Time to pass through tunnel = (Length of train + Length of tunnel) / Reduced speed Time to pass through tunnel = (1200 m + 500 m) / 16.6667 m/s ≈ 102.00 seconds Finally, the total time taken for the train to completely cross the man and exit the tunnel is the sum of the time to cross the man and the time to pass through the tunnel: Total time = Time to cross the man + Time to pass through tunnel Total time ≈ 50.24 seconds + 102.00 seconds ≈ 152.24 seconds Therefore, the train will take approximately boxed{152.24} seconds to completely cross the man and exit the tunnel from the moment it starts to cross the man."},{"prompt":"Prove that if p and q are two prime numbers, such that p+p^2+p^3+...+p^q=q+q^2+q^3+...+q^p, then p=q .","completion":"1.

Therefore: [ p(p^q - 1)(q - 1) equiv 0 pmod{p} ] This implies: [ q(q^p - 1)(p - 1) equiv 0 pmod{p} ] 6. By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( q^p equiv q pmod{p} ).

Consider a tetrahedron ABCD. We denote the midpoint of edge AB as E and the midpoint of edge CD as G, hence E and G connect two opposite edges of the tetrahedron. 2. Examine the plane passing through points E and G. This plane is called the plane CEG. We first show that this plane divides the tetrahedron into two equal-volume parts. 3. Since E is the midpoint of AB, and G is the midpoint of CD, lines CE and EG cut triangles ABC and BCD into two equal areas respectively. 4. The tetrahedron AECD and EBCD have the same base area when considering triangles AEC and BEC. Furthermore, they also share the same height from vertex D perpendicular to the base plane ABC. 5. Therefore, the volumes (V_{AECD}) and (V_{EBCD}) are equal, since the volume of a tetrahedron is given by: [ V = frac{1}{3} times (text{Base Area}) times (text{Height}) ] 6. Now, let’s consider a rotation of the plane CEG around the line EG. This plane intersects the tetrahedron along a quadrilateral EFGH. We next argue that the rotated plane will also divide the tetrahedron into two parts of equal volume. 7. To illustrate this, focus on tetrahedron EBCD. Rotating the plane CEG yields a new plane slicing off pyramid EGHD and adding pyramid EGFC to EBCD instead. 8. By construction and symmetry around EG, triangle EGH is congruent to triangle EGF because points F and H are equidistant from the line EG. Thus, the areas of these triangles are equal. 9. Since G is the midpoint of CD, both C and D are at equal distances from the plane EFGH, ensuring that the heights of the pyramids EGHD and EGFC are the same. 10. Consequently, the volumes of pyramids EGHD and EGFC are equal, which implies that the rotated plane also divides the tetrahedron into two regions of equal volume. 11. To observe dynamically, as the plane rotates around GE, point F moves along the segment CA towards A. When F coincides with A, the rotating plane becomes ABG, lying on the original plane. 12. Continuing rotations around GE will further repeat the conditions described, ensuring that all intermediate planes formed during the rotation divide the tetrahedron into equal volumes. # Conclusion: Thus, any plane passing through the midpoints of two opposite edges of a tetrahedron always divides the tetrahedron into two equal volumes.

Therefore, either: [ p^{2n} mid x quad text{or} quad p^{2n} mid x + 1 ] 2. **Case Analysis:** i. **Case 1:** If (p^{2n} mid x): [ x = k p^{2n} quad text{for some integer } k ] ii. **Case 2:** If (p^{2n} mid x + 1): [ x + 1 = k p^{2n} quad text{for some integer } k ] 3. **Bounding (x):** Notice that in both cases, since (x) or (x + 1) is divisible by (p^{2n}), we have: [ x + 1 geq p^{2n} quad text{or} quad x geq p^{2n} - 1 ] 4. **Equation Transformation:** Consider the original equation: [ p^{2n} y(y + 1) = x(x + 1) ] This can be rearranged as: [ x(x + 1) = p^{2n} left(y(y + 1)right) ] To proceed, observe a pattern involving (p) and substitute the properties of (x) and (x + 1). 5. **Rewriting and Contradiction:** Rewrite the equation using symmetrical properties: [ p^{2n}-1 = left(p^n (2y + 1) + (2x+1)right)left(p^n (2y + 1) - (2x + 1)right) ] From the factorization, note that both terms on the right side must be integers. Hence, we get: [ p^{2n} - 1 geq p^n (2y + 1) + (2x + 1) > 2x + 1 ] 6. **Deriving a Contradiction:** Combining inequalities: [ p^{2n} > 2(x + 1) ] However, we have (x + 1 geq p^{2n}).

This point D' is such that it is on the extension of OD and is twice as far from O as D. - The points F and E, where the bisectors of the internal and external angles at vertex A intersect BC, will map to F' and E' respectively.

Since AB is not a bridge, B must have some other neighbor in R on the other side from A, say E. Then, we must have some other path from A to E that is not through B. In that case, the path either goes around C or around D.

If k = 2, then R is a unit square and so G is a single vertex. If G is a bridge, then R can be split into R_1, R_2 with perimeters P_1, P_2 and adjacency graphs G_1, G_2. Then, [ operatorname{diam} G leq operatorname{diam} G_1 + operatorname{diam} G_2 + 1 leq frac{P_1}{2} - 2 + frac{P_2}{2} - 2 + 1 = frac{P+2}{2} - 3 = k-2 ] indeed.

We claim now that the grid squares T_1, ldots, T_m are all in R. For 1 leq i leq m-1, T_i in R follows from Lemma 1 since S_i, S_{i+1} are both in R but the square above S_i is not. For i = m, note that S_{m-1}, S_m are in R but the square above S_m is not. Thus, if R' is R with the S_i's removed, then R' is still a snorlax. Furthermore, R''s perimeter is 2(k-1). Finally, if R' has adjacency graph G', then [ begin{aligned} operatorname{diam} G &= maxleft(operatorname{diam} G', m-1, max_{substack{v in G' 1 leq i leq m}} d(v, S_i)right) &leq maxleft(operatorname{diam} G', m-1, max_{substack{v in G' 1 leq i leq m}} d(v, T_i) + 1right) &leq maxleft(operatorname{diam} G', m-1, operatorname{diam} G' + 1right) &= operatorname{diam} G' + 1 end{aligned} ] where we note that operatorname{diam} G' geq m-1 since d(T_1, T_m) = m-1.

Let S_t be the set of squares flooded on the t-th turn. Then, d(O, A) = t (as vertices of G) for any A in S_t. In particular, suppose you win on your n-th turn. Then, the enclosed region R has perimeter at most 2n. Furthermore, [ R supset S_0 cup S_1 cup cdots cup S_{n-1}, ] and S_{n-1} is nonempty. So, operatorname{diam} G geq n-1 since d(O, A) = n-1 for A in S_{n-1}, while R's perimeter is at most 2n, contradicting Lemma 2.

This is because the direction of the normal vector determines the orientation of the plane. Therefore, if two normal vectors are parallel, their corresponding planes do not intersect and are parallel to each other. 2. **Statement ②**: overrightarrow{n_1} is perpendicular to overrightarrow{n_2} Leftrightarrow alpha is perpendicular to beta. - Similar to the reasoning for statement ①, if the normal vectors of two planes are perpendicular to each other, it means the planes are oriented at a right angle to each other, making the planes perpendicular.

Let's break down the steps involved: 1. **Understanding the Function ( S(m) ):** We start by noting that: leftlfloor frac{m}{k} rightrfloor represents the largest integer less than or equal to ( frac{m}{k} ). Summing these floor functions from ( k = 1 ) to ( k = m ) gives us ( S(m). ) 2. **Behavior of ( S(m) ):** It’s known that ( S(m) ) can be approximated by the harmonic series: S(m) approx m log m but we need a more precise approximation. More precisely, we have: S(m) = sum_{k=1}^{m} leftlfloor frac{m}{k} rightrfloor = m left(log m + gamma - 1right), where ( gamma ) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. 3. **Relating ( S(m) = n^2 + a ):** We need to examine when: n^2 + a = sum_{k=1}^{m} leftlfloor frac{m}{k} rightrfloor We rewrite the equation: S(m) - a = n^2 4. **Finding Pairs ((m, n)) Satisfying the Equation:** To analyze this, we need to determine the behavior and range of values that ( S(m) ) can take. As mentioned earlier, ( S(m) ) tends to grow like ( m log m ), hence ( S(m) ) is strictly increasing as ( m ) increases. 5. **Checking if More Than ( 10^6 ) Solutions Exist:** For large ( m ): S(m+1) - S(m) approx log m + gamma which is positive. Therefore, ( S(m) ) can take arbitrarily large values. 6. **Resulting Number of Solutions:** If we consider ( n = k sqrt{S(m) - a} ), then there are many potential values for ( m ) and ( n ). For a fixed ( a ), you can find various pairs ((m, n)) that satisfy this equation. The key point is that ( S(m) ) can be tuned by choosing appropriate ( m ) to yield ( S(m) = n^2 + a ). Conclusion: Since ( S(m) to infty ) as ( m to infty ), and given the structure of ( S(m) ), there exist many integer pairs ((m, n)) for which ( S(m) - a = n^2 ).

To do this, we find a common multiple for b in the first two ratios and for c in the last two ratios. For b, the common multiple of 4 (from a:b) and 7 (from b:c) is 28 (since 4 * 7 = 28). For c, the common multiple of 9 (from b:c) and 5 (from c:d) is 45 (since 9 * 5 = 45).

Let’s analyze this step by step. 1. **Petya's First Move:** - Let Petya set the constant term (free term) of the equation to zero. This will make the modified equation: [ x^3 + ax^2 + bx = 0. ] Setting the constant term to zero ensures that one root of the equation is (0). 2. **Vasya's Move:** - Next, Vasya will modify either the (a) or (b) coefficient.

Let's denote these roots by (r_1) and (r_2), with (r_2 = r_1 + 2014). 4. **Setting the Coefficients:** - By Vieta's formulas for (x^2 + ax + c = 0), the sum of roots (r_1) and (r_2) is equal to (-a). Therefore: [ r_1 + r_2 = -a implies r_1 + (r_1 + 2014) = -a implies 2r_1 + 2014 = -a implies a = -(2r_1 + 2014). ] - The product of roots (r_1) and (r_2) is equal to (c). Therefore: [ r_1 cdot r_2 = c implies r_1 cdot (r_1 + 2014) = c implies r_1^2 + 2014r_1 = c. ] - Petya can always choose (a) and (c) to be rational (since (r_1) is rational by choosing (r_1) appropriately), ensuring that the roots (0, (r_1), and (r_1 + 2014)) meet the condition. 5. **Alternative Approach:** - Consider Petya assigns (x = -t^2) first where (t = 1007). This modifies the equation to: [ x^3 + ax^2 - 1007^2 x + c = 0. ] - Depending on Vasya’s move, Petya can then fix the remaining term to: [ c = -at^2 = -a(1007^2). ] In both methods, the careful assignment of rational numbers as coefficients ensures the difference between the non-zero roots equals 2014.

Understanding the number of possible sequences: Firstly, let's denote a sequence of ( n ) natural numbers as ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). Each two consecutive numbers within the sequence differ by at most 1. This condition on the sequence elements implies that the difference sequence ( b_i = a_{i+1} - a_i ) can only take values from the set ({-1, 0, 1}) for ( 1 leq i leq n-1 ). Thus, the total number of such difference sequences of length ( n-1 ) is ( 3^{n-1} ) (since each of ( n-1 ) differences can be (-1, 0), or ( 1)). 2. Counting the sequences that meet requirements: To find the desired sequences that include the number 3 at least once, we need to exclude those that do not include the number 3. 3. Exclusion of sequences not containing the number 3: If a sequence does not contain the number 3, then all its elements must either be all less than 3 or all greater than 3, since they can only differ by at most 1. Sequences made from numbers all less than 3 (using 1 and 2) can be calculated by considering sequences formed from just two numbers: - These sequences of length ( n ) (formed from 1 and 2 only) amount to ( 2^n ), as each position in the sequence can independently be either 1 or 2. 4. Combining the results: As derived above, the number of sequences of length ( n ) containing elements less than or equal to 3 is ( 3^{n-1} ). Consequently, the number of sequences containing at least one 3 is given by subtracting the number of sequences composed of only 1 and 2 from the total. Therefore, the total number of valid sequences is ( 3^n - 2^n ). 5. Specific Calculation for ( n = 100 ): Plugging in ( n = 100 ), [ S = 3^{100} ] and the number of sequences with numbers only 1 and 2 is [ 2^{100} ].

Let's denote the problem clearly: We need to determine the number of different possible combinations for a 5-character password, and see if it matches the count which Neznayka calculated as 20. 2. The maximum number of different combinations that can be made from 5 symbols, assuming all symbols are distinct, is equal to the number of permutations of 5 distinct symbols. This can be computed using the factorial function. The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is given by: [ n! = n times (n-1) times (n-2) times cdots times 1 ] So, [ 5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120 ] 3. If there are repeated symbols, the number of unique permutations where the repetition occurs needs to be divided by the factorial of the count of each repeated group of symbols. This is given by: [ frac{n!}{k_1! times k_2! times cdots times k_r!} ] where ( k_1, k_2, ldots, k_r ) are the counts of each repeated symbol. 4. Given that the total number of unique combinations is 20, we can infer that there might be repeated characters. We need to find ( k ) for which the equation: [ frac{5!}{k!} = 20 ] holds true for some integer ( k ). 5. Solve the equation to find ( k ): - We know ( 5! = 120 ), thus: [ frac{120}{k!} = 20 ] - Simplifying this, we get: [ k! = frac{120}{20} = 6 ] - The value of ( k ) that satisfies ( k! = 6 ) is: [ k = 3 quad text{since} quad 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6 ] Therefore, the configuration of symbols that fits this scenario is that there are 3 identical symbols of one type and the other two symbols are unique. For instance, if the given symbols are 'e', 'r', 'o', 'r', 'r', this configuration has one 3 repetitions of 'r' and 2 unique symbols 'e' and 'o'. 6.

Therefore, the degree d_y for such a point y must be at least 2. - Given that the union of the circles is connected, each circle x must intersect with at least another circle, hence the degree of circle x, noted as d_x, gives the total number of distinct points shared between circle x and other circles. - Consider the relationship: [ d_{x} geq d_{y} ] This simplifies our counting since each circle contributes at least once for each shared point. 5. **Re-arranging the Summations**: - By re-arranging the summation from individual points to the circles, we get: [ sum_{(x, y), x sim y} frac{1}{d_{y}} geq sum_{(x, y), x sim y} frac{1}{d_{x}} ] Since sum_{y in Y} frac{1}{d_y} counts each edge weighed by the reciprocal of the degree of the point, and sum_{x in X} frac{1}{d_x} counts each edge weighted by the reciprocal of the degree of the circle, the inequality holds because each circle intersects other circles at exactly distinct points. 6. **Summing Over Circles**: - This leads to: [ sum_{(x, y), x sim y} frac{1}{d_{x}} = sum_{x in X} 1 = n ] This result follows because each circle x in X contributes to at least one intersection. 7. **Conclusion**: - Combining the inequalities, we have: [ |S| = sum_{y in Y} 1 geq sum_{(x, y), x sim y} frac{1}{d_{y}} geq sum_{x in X} 1 = n ] Thus, the inequality |S| geq n is verified.

This is because, for any a in the domain, looking at |a| considers both the mirrored side (if a is negative) and the actual value (if a is positive). - **Translating Inequality to Domain Range**: The condition fleft(|a|right)leqslant fleft(2right) under the function's behavior implies |a| geqslant 2. This is because, as the function is decreasing on the positive side past 0, a larger |a| means a is either far to the left (negative) or far to the right (positive) of the axis to satisfy the inequality under the function's behavior. - **Determining the Range of a**: The inequality |a| geqslant 2 simplifies to two conditions: a leqslant -2 or a geqslant 2. This covers both sides of the axis, respecting the even function's symmetry and the inequality given. Thus, the range of the real number a that satisfies fleft(aright)leqslant fleft(2right) under these function conditions is a leqslant -2 or a geqslant 2.

The response follows from the general fact: let the number of cards be ( n ), where ( 2^{k-1} leq n < 2^k ) (for natural numbers ( n ) and ( k )); then ( k ) empty boxes are required.

Calculate the ratio: [ frac{x_1 + x_2}{x_1 cdot x_2} = frac{frac{2p}{k}}{frac{2pa}{k^2}} = frac{2p}{2pa} = frac{1}{a} ] This shows that the ratio [ frac{x_1 + x_2}{x_1 cdot x_2} ] is indeed a constant (frac{1}{a}) regardless of the value of (k). Part (2): Given the parabolic equation [ y^2 = 2p(x - a), ] where ( a > 0 ). Let ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) be two lines passing through the origin which intersect the parabola at two pairs of points ( {A, B} ) and ( {C, D} ) respectively. 1. Let the equations of the lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) be: [ y = k_1 x, quad y = k_2 x ] where ( k_1, k_2 neq 0 ) and ( k_1 neq k_2 ). 2. Substituting ( y = k_1 x ) into ( y^2 = 2p(x - a) ), we get: [ (k_1 x)^2 = 2p(x - a) ] [ k_1^2 x^2 = 2p x - 2pa ] [ k_1^2 x^2 - 2px + 2pa = 0 ] 3. Similarly, substituting ( y = k_2 x ) into ( y^2 = 2p(x - a) ), we get: [ k_2^2 x^2 - 2px + 2pa = 0 ] 4. According to Vieta's formulas: - For ( l_1 ), the sums and products of the roots (intersections ( A(x_1), B(x_2) )) are: [ x_1 + x_2 = frac{2p}{k_1^2}, quad x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{2pa}{k_1^2} ] - For ( l_2 ), the sums and products of the roots (intersections ( C(x_3), D(x_4) )) are: [ x_3 + x_4 = frac{2p}{k_2^2}, quad x_3 cdot x_4 = frac{2pa}{k_2^2} ] 5. Note the relationship by Part (1): [ frac{x_1 + x_2}{x_1 x_2} = frac{1}{a} quad text{and} quad frac{x_3 + x_4}{x_3 x_4} = frac{1}{a} ] 6. For lines passing through points ( A ) and ( D ), represented by ( l_3 ): - ( l_3: y - k_1 x_1 = frac{k_1 x_1 - k_2 x_4}{x_1 - x_4} (x - x_1) ) - Setting ( x = 0 ) (to find the y-intercept): [ y = frac{(k_2 - k_1) x_1 x_4}{x_1 - x_4} ] 7. For lines passing through points ( B ) and ( C ), represented by ( l_4 ): - ( l_4: y - k_1 x_2 = frac{k_1 x_2 - k_2 x_3}{x_2 - x_3} (x - x_2) ) - Setting ( x = 0 ) (to find the y-intercept): [ y = frac{(k_2 - k_1) x_2 x_3}{x_2 - x_3} ] 8. Thus, the y-intercepts [ OP = left| frac{(k_2 - k_1) x_1 x_4}{x_1 - x_4} right| ] [ OQ = left| frac{(k_2 - k_1) x_2 x_3}{x_2 - x_3} right| ] 9. Since [ frac{x_1 x_4}{x_1 - x_4} = frac{x_2 x_3}{x_3 - x_2}, ] it follows that [ |OP| = |OQ|. ] Therefore, [ |OP| = |OQ| ] (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"At a university, the division of sciences consists of three departments: physics, chemistry, and biology.

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information: 1. Each set of type A souvenirs costs 20 yuan more than each set of type B souvenirs, which gives us the equation x = y + 20. 2. One set of type A souvenirs and two sets of type B souvenirs together cost 200 yuan, leading to the equation x + 2y = 200. We can solve this system of equations as follows: - From the first equation, we have x = y + 20. - Substituting x from the first equation into the second equation, we get (y + 20) + 2y = 200. - Simplifying the equation, we find 3y + 20 = 200. - Solving for y, we get 3y = 180, so y = 60. - Substituting y = 60 back into the first equation, we find x = 60 + 20 = 80.

The total profit from selling type A souvenirs, denoted as w, can be calculated as w = m(n - 80) = (-frac{1}{2}n + 90)(n - 80). Simplifying this expression, we get w = -frac{1}{2}(n - 130)^2 + 1250. Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative, the graph of this function is a downward-opening parabola, which means the maximum value of w occurs at the vertex of the parabola. Given the range 80 leqslant n leqslant 120, the maximum profit occurs at the upper limit of this range, which is when n = 120.

Consider the two types of sets in ( S_{n+1} ): - Sets ( A in S_{n+1} ) that do not contain ( n+1 ). - Sets ( A in S_{n+1} ) that contain ( n+1 ). 5. **Mapping between sets**: - For sets in ( S_{n+1} ) that do not contain ( n+1 ), we have ( A in S_n ). - For sets in ( S_{n+1} ) that contain ( n+1 ), define a function ( f ) which maps such sets ( A ) to ( B ) as follows: - Remove ( n+1 ) from ( A ) and reduce each remaining element by 1. This gives a set ( B ) in ( S_{n-1} ). - The function ( f ) is bijective, as each set ( A ) in ( S_{n+1} ) that contains ( n+1 ) can be uniquely mapped to a set ( B ) in ( S_{n-1} ) and vice versa. 6. **Summing contributions**: - Therefore, each minimal selfish set in ( S_{n+1} ) either is in ( S_n ) or can be mapped to ( S_{n-1} ). - Thus, we obtain the recurrence relation: [ u_{n+1} = u_n + u_{n-1} ] 7. **Initial values**: - For ( n=2 ), the minimal selfish sets of ({1, 2}) are ({2}), so ( u_2 = 1 ). - For ( n=3 ), the minimal selfish sets of ({1, 2, 3}) are ({2, 3}) and ({1, 2}), so ( u_3 = 2 ). 8. **Fibonacci sequence**: - Given the recurrence relation ( u_{n+1} = u_n + u_{n-1} ) with initial values ( u_2 = 1 ) and ( u_3 = 2 ), we identify ( u_n ) as the Fibonacci sequence shifted by one index (starting from ( u_2 )). - Hence, the number of minimal selfish sets for ({1, 2, ..., n}) is given by the (n−1)-th Fibonacci number. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The number of minimal selfish subsets of } N text{ is the } (n-1)text{-th Fibonacci number.}} ]"},{"prompt":"A fenced, rectangular field measures 30 meters by 60 meters.

Draw the altitude AH of triangle ABC. We need to prove that the intersection point N of lines PQ and P'Q' lies on this altitude. 4. First, note that SP and SQ are two chords of the circle Gamma that meet at S. Therefore, SP = SQ and angle SIP = angle SPQ = angle SQP. 5. Since SQ is a chord of Gamma_0 intersecting BC, then SQ satisfies the power of a point theorem: SQ^2 = SB cdot SC. 6.

The distance between the center of the ellipse and each focus is c, where c^2 = a^2 - b^2. In this problem, a^2 = 25 and b^2 = 4, so c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{25-4} = sqrt{21}. Given the distance between A and B as |AB| = 8, we use the property of an ellipse that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to 2a. Hence, for this ellipse, that sum is 2 cdot 5 = 10. Therefore, for points A and B, we have: |AF_1| + |AF_2| = |BF_1| + |BF_2| = 10. Since A, F_2, and B are collinear and A and B lie on the ellipse, the segment F_2B is part of the sum of distances AF_1 + AF_2. In other words, the segment AB lies between A and F_2, and as such, when we sum up the lengths of AF_1, AF_2, and BF_1, we are essentially double-counting the length of AB. Thus, we can write: |AF_1| + |AF_2| + |BF_1| = |AF_1| + |AB| + |BF_1| = 2a + |AB| = 2 cdot 5 + 8 = 18. However, since we have double-counted |AB|, we need to subtract it once to get the original sum: |AF_1| + |BF_1| = 18 - 8 = 10. Upon observation of the answer choices, we can see that none of the options match 10, which means that there might be a mistake in either the original problem or the solution. Let's examine the process again: we established that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is 2a = 10 not 2 cdot 5 = 10.

Rachel picked twice as many blueberries as Christine, so she picked 2 * 8 pounds = 16 pounds of blueberries. Rachel picked half as many raspberries as Christine, so she picked 0.5 * 20 pounds = 10 pounds of raspberries. Now, let's add the berries picked by both Christine and Rachel to find the total amount of each type of berry they have: Total strawberries = Christine's strawberries + Rachel's strawberries Total strawberries = 10 pounds + 20 pounds = 30 pounds Total blueberries = Christine's blueberries + Rachel's blueberries Total blueberries = 8 pounds + 16 pounds = 24 pounds Total raspberries = Christine's raspberries + Rachel's raspberries Total raspberries = 20 pounds + 10 pounds = 30 pounds Now, let's calculate how many pies of each type they can make: Strawberry Pies = Total strawberries / Strawberries per pie Strawberry Pies = 30 pounds / 3 pounds per pie = 10 pies Blueberry Pies = Total blueberries / Blueberries per pie Blueberry Pies = 24 pounds / 2 pounds per pie = 12 pies Raspberry Pies = Total raspberries / Raspberries per pie Raspberry Pies = 30 pounds / 4 pounds per pie = 7.5 pies Since they can't make half a pie, they can make 7 Raspberry Pies.

From the given line equation xcos α - ysin α + frac{1}{2} = 0 and circle equation (x - cos β)^2 + (y + sin β)^2 = frac{1}{2}, we can derive an expression for the distance d from the circle center to the line. Then, using the vectors overset{⇀}{m} = (2cos α, 2sin α) and overset{⇀}{n} = (3cos β, 3sin β), we can calculate the value of d and compare it to the circle radius to find the answer. First, we find the circle center and radius: The circle's equation is (x - cos β)^2 + (y + sin β)^2 = frac{1}{2}. Thus, the circle center coordinates are (cos β, -sin β), and the radius is frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Next, we find the distance d from the circle center to the line: The distance d is given by | cos α cos β + sin α sin β + frac{1}{2} | = | cos(α - β) + frac{1}{2} |. Now, we use the given vectors and their angle: overset{⇀}{m} = (2cos α, 2sin α) and overset{⇀}{n} = (3cos β, 3sin β) have an angle of 60^{circ} between them. Thus, 2 cdot 3 cdot cos 60^{circ} = 6 cos α cos β + 6 sin α sin β. This simplifies to cos α cos β + sin α sin β = frac{1}{2}. So, d = |frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2}| = 1.

This was a grand sports event presented by China to the world and a new chapter jointly written by the people of Asia. In a table tennis match with a bestoffive games format where the first player to win three games wins the match, player A has a probability of frac{2}{3} of winning each game against player B. Assuming the outcomes of each game are independent, find: (1) The probability that player A wins exactly four games in the match. (2) Let X be the total number of games played in the match. Find the probability distribution and the expected value of X. (3) If a match can be played with either a bestofthree games format with two wins required or a bestoffive games format with three wins required, which format should player B choose for their advantage? Provide the chosen format directly.","completion":"# Solution: Part (1): Probability that player A wins exactly four games in the match. To win the match in exactly four games, player A must win two of the first three games and then win the fourth game. The probability of this happening can be calculated as follows: - The probability of winning two out of the first three games is given by the combination formula C_3^2 times the probability of winning two games (frac{2}{3})^2 and losing one game frac{1}{3}. - Then, player A must win the fourth game, which has a probability of frac{2}{3}. Therefore, the probability P is calculated as: P = C_3^2 times {(frac{2}{3})^2} times frac{1}{3} times frac{2}{3} = 3 times frac{4}{9} times frac{1}{3} times frac{2}{3} = frac{8}{27} Thus, the probability that player A wins exactly four games in the match is boxed{frac{8}{27}}. Part (2): Probability distribution and expected value of X. - For X=3, the match ends in three games if player A wins all three games or loses all three games. Thus, P(X=3) = {(frac{2}{3})^3} + {(frac{1}{3})^3} = frac{8}{27} + frac{1}{27} = frac{1}{3}. - For X=4, the match ends in four games if player A wins three out of the first four games. This can happen in two scenarios: winning the first three and losing one, or losing the first and winning the next three. Thus, P(X=4) = C_3^2 times {(frac{2}{3})^2} times frac{1}{3} times frac{2}{3} + C_3^2 times {(frac{1}{3})^2} times frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{3} = frac{10}{27}. - For X=5, the match ends in five games if all previous outcomes are not met, thus P(X=5) = 1 - P(X=3) - P(X=4) = 1 - frac{1}{3} - frac{10}{27} = frac{8}{27}. The distribution of X is: | X | 3 | 4 | 5 | |-----|-----|-----|-----| | P | frac{1}{3} | frac{10}{27} | frac{8}{27} | The expected value E(X) is calculated as: E(X) = 3 times frac{1}{3} + 4 times frac{10}{27} + 5 times frac{8}{27} = frac{107}{27} Therefore, the expected value of X is boxed{frac{107}{27}}. Part (3): Best format for player B's advantage. - In the best-of-three games format, the probability of player B winning is calculated by considering the scenarios where player B wins two games. This gives P_1 = {(frac{1}{3})^2} + C_2^1 times frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{3} times frac{1}{3} = frac{7}{27}. - In the best-of-five games format, the probability of player B winning is calculated by considering all scenarios where player B wins three games. This gives P_2 = {(frac{1}{3})^3} + C_3^1 times frac{2}{3} times {(frac{1}{3})^2} times frac{1}{3} + C_4^2 times {(frac{2}{3})^2} times {(frac{1}{3})^2} times frac{1}{3} = frac{17}{81}. Since frac{7}{27} > frac{17}{81}, i.e., P_1 > P_2, player B should choose the best-of-three games format for their advantage.

The width of each rectangle corresponds to the bin range, and the area of each rectangle represents the frequency of the data within that bin. Now, in a frequency distribution histogram, each rectangle's area is equal to the frequency of the corresponding class interval (bin) times the class width (bin width). To find the total area of all the rectangles (which represents the total frequency of the data), we need to sum the areas of all the individual rectangles. Mathematically, if A_i is the area of the i-th rectangle, f_i is the frequency (height of the rectangle), and w is the uniform class width, then we represent the area of the i-th rectangle by A_i = f_i times w Since each rectangle's area is the frequency of the dataset for that interval, the sum of the areas of all rectangles will be the sum of all frequencies, which essentially is the total number of data points (observations) in the histogram. Therefore, if we have n intervals, the total area A_{total} of all the rectangles will be A_{total} = sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i = sum_{i=1}^{n} (f_i times w) In many cases, each class interval is of equal width, so we can factor out the width w from the summation as a common factor: A_{total} = w times sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i With sum_{i=1}^{n} f_i being the total number of observations, N. Hence the total area is simply the product of the class width and the total number of observations: A_{total} = w times N Assuming the histogram has a uniform class width, the total area under the histogram is simply the total number of data points represented in the histogram.

(2) The planning team believes that there is a cheaper purchasing plan than 390 and requests the minimum total cost of purchasing the two types of green plants.","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: Finding the Number of Pots of Each Type of Green Plant Let's denote the number of pots of green lily as x and the number of pots of spider plant as y. According to the problem statement, we have two equations: 1. The total number of pots is 46: x + y = 46 2. The total cost for all pots is 390: 9x + 6y = 390 Solving these equations step by step: - Multiply the first equation by 6 to make the coefficients of y the same in both equations: 6(x + y) = 6 cdot 46 Rightarrow 6x + 6y = 276 - Subtract this new equation from the second equation to eliminate y: (9x + 6y) - (6x + 6y) = 390 - 276 Rightarrow 3x = 114 - Solve for x: x = frac{114}{3} = 38 Substitute x = 38 back into the first equation to find y: - 38 + y = 46 Rightarrow y = 46 - 38 = 8 Checking the condition that the number of green lily pots is at least twice the number of spider plant pots: - 2 times 8 = 16 < 38, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, the solution is boxed{38 text{ pots of green lily and 8 pots of spider plant}}. Part 2: Finding the Minimum Total Cost of Purchasing the Two Types of Green Plants Let the number of pots of green lily be m, then the number of pots of spider plant is (46 - m). According to the condition, we have: - m geq 2(46 - m) Solving this inequality: - m geq 92 - 2m - 3m geq 92 - m geq frac{92}{3} Since m must be an integer and m geq frac{92}{3}, the smallest integer value for m is 31. Let the total cost of purchasing the two types of green plants be w dollars, then: - w = 9m + 6(46 - m) = 3m + 276 Substituting m = 31: - w = 3 times 31 + 276 = 93 + 276 = 369 Therefore, the minimum total cost of purchasing the two types of green plants is boxed{369} dollars."},{"prompt":"Phil started his day with 40.

We need to show that any initial collection of piles can be transformed into one single pile by combining piles whose sizes are similar. 2. **Consider the Reverse Process**: Instead of starting with one pile and breaking it down, visualize the reverse process. Assume we initially have several individual piles, each containing exactly one stone. The goal is to combine these individual piles into one single pile of size ( n ), where ( n ) is the total number of stones. 3. **Combining Process**: At any step, we can combine two piles of sizes ( x ) and ( y ) (where ( x leq y )) to form a new pile of size ( x + y ). This is valid under the condition that ( x ) and ( y ) are similar sizes, i.e., ( x leq y leq 2x ). 4. **Maintaining Similar Sizes**: - Since we are starting with piles of size 1 (where all piles are similar), assume we always pick the smallest piles to combine. - Each time we combine two piles, say sizes ( x ) and ( y ) (with ( x leq y )), the resulting pile will have size ( x + y ). - The new pile size ( x + y ) must be less than or equal to ( 2y ), hence still meeting the requirement of similar sizes (as ( y leq 2x )). 5. **Inductive Argument**: - We start with ( n ) piles of size 1. - Combining pairs of piles gradually reduces the number of piles while ensuring that all resulting piles maintain the condition of similar sizes. - The process continues, maintaining the invariant that no pile will differ from the other by more than a factor of two. 6. **Reaching the Final Pile**: - This combining will eventually reduce the number of piles until only one pile remains. - Since at every stage the combined pile size respects the similar size condition, the final pile formed is of size ( n ).

Let this line intersect the sides ( CA ) and ( CB ) (or their extensions) at points ( A_2 ) and ( B_2 ) respectively. 3. Since ( AB ) is the base of the isosceles triangle, the angles subtended by the base at the top vertex ( C ) are equal, i.e., ( angle CAB = angle CBA ). 4.

The sum of six acute angles would be less than: [ 6 times 90^circ = 540^circ. ] Let (x) be the measure of the obtuse angle. The total sum must satisfy (540^circ + x = 900^circ), which indicates (x = 360^circ); this violates the obtuse range, making it impossible for six angles to be acute. 4. **Consider the case of five acute angles and two obtuse angles**: The sum of five acute angles would be less than: [ 5 times 90^circ = 450^circ. ] If we choose two obtuse angles, each ideally less than (180^circ) but more than (90^circ) to ensure all side lengths remain positive, let's set (x) for each obtuse angle. Then, (450^circ + 2x = 900^circ) implies (2x = 450^circ), so (x = 225^circ) each, which is not valid as each angle must be less than (180^circ). 5. **Consider the case of four acute angles and three obtuse angles**: If we choose four acute angles each measuring (80^circ) and three obtuse angles each measuring (160^circ), the sum would be: [ 4 times 80^circ + 3 times 160^circ = 320^circ + 480^circ = 800^circ. ] This does not satisfy the total required sum of (900^circ) for a heptagon, therefore this setup is flawed.

Consider the equation ( (x + y)^2 = (x - y)^2 + 4xy ) since ( xy = a^2 ). [ (x + y)^2 = (x - y)^2 + 4a^2 ] 4. The minimum value of ( (x + y)^2 ) occurs when ( x = y ).

Therefore, the minimum possible value of ( x + y ) is (2a), leading to the minimum possible value of the length of the rectangle being (a). **Second Method:** 7. Assume one side of the rectangle is (x). The adjacent side then is ( frac{a^2}{x} ). 8. The semi-perimeter (p) of the rectangle is given by: [ p = frac{x + frac{a^2}{x}}{2} ] 9. To find the smallest (p): [ x + frac{a^2}{x} geq 2a ] This is established from the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality): [ frac{x + frac{a^2}{x}}{2} geq sqrt{x cdot frac{a^2}{x}} = sqrt{a^2} = a ] [ x + frac{a^2}{x} geq 2a ] 10. Thus, the smallest value of (p) will be (2a) when (x = a). **Third Method:** 11. Again, if one side of the rectangle is (x), the other side is (frac{a^2}{x}). 12. The length of the semi-perimeter is ( frac{a^2}{x} + x ). 13. To show (p geq 2a): [ x + frac{a^2}{x} - 2a geq 0 ] which follows from our previous inequality. **Fourth Method:** 14. Consider a square with side length (a). The perimeter of the square is: [ 4a ] 15. Now, if we modify one side (a - m) and the other side (a + n) to keep the area constant: [ (a - m)(a + n) = a^2 ] we find: [ a(n - m) = mn ] 16. Ensuring the area remains (a^2), [ n - m geq 0 ] 17.

Given that the student has a 60% shooting accuracy and each shot is independent, we can model the number of successful shots as a binomial distribution Xsim Bleft(10,0.6right), where 10 is the number of trials (shots) and 0.6 is the probability of success (making the shot). 1. **Calculate the Expected Number of Successful Shots (E(X)):** - The expected value of a binomial distribution is given by E(X) = n times p, where n is the number of trials and p is the probability of success. - For this problem, n=10 and p=0.6, so we have: [ E(X) = 10 times 0.6 = 6 ] 2. **Calculate the Expected Score:** - Each successful shot earns 5 points, so the points from successful shots are 6 times 5. - Each missed shot deducts 1 point. Since there are 10 shots in total and 6 are successful, 4 are missed. The points deducted from missed shots are 4 times (-1). - Therefore, the expected score is the sum of points from successful shots and the deduction from missed shots: [ text{Expected Score} = 6 times 5 + (10 - 6) times (-1) = 30 - 4 = 26 ] Thus, the expected score of the student is boxed{26}.

This means that the direction vectors are negative multiples of each other, which implies that l_{1} and l_{2}, being non-coincident and having direction vectors that are scalar multiples of each other, are parallel. Therefore, option A is correct. **Option B:** Given overrightarrow{a}=(1,-1,2) and overrightarrow{u}=(6,4,-1), we want to check if l is perpendicular to alpha. For l to be perpendicular to alpha, overrightarrow{a} should be parallel to overrightarrow{u}. However, overrightarrow{a} is not a scalar multiple of overrightarrow{u}, which means l is not necessarily perpendicular to alpha. Hence, option B is incorrect. **Option C:** For the normal vectors overrightarrow{u}=(2,2,-1) and overrightarrow{v}=(-3,4,2), we compute the dot product overrightarrow{u} cdot overrightarrow{v} = (2 times -3) + (2 times 4) + (-1 times 2) = -6 + 8 - 2 = 0. A dot product equal to zero indicates that overrightarrow{u} and overrightarrow{v} are perpendicular. Since the normal vectors of planes alpha and beta are perpendicular, the planes alpha and beta themselves are perpendicular.

Which digit will appear more frequently: 1 or 2?","completion":"1. We start by understanding the given problem, which involves repeatedly summing the digits of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000,000 until we obtain one billion single-digit numbers. The task is to determine whether there are more 1s or 2s among these single-digit results. 2. A key observation here is that the sum of the digits of a number mod 9 yields the same remainder as the number itself mod 9. This is because digit sum modulo applies the properties of congruence in number theory. 3. Therefore, each final single-digit result for our numbers depends on the initial number’s residue modulo 9. A number that gives remainder (r) when divided by 9 will eventually be reduced to (r), or reduced further by this method until a single-digit (r) is obtained. 4. We should check the distribution of residues for numbers modulo 9 from 1 to 1,000,000,000: - Numbers taking remainder 1 by mod 9 are: 1, 10, 19, 28, ..., 999999991, 1000000000. - Numbers taking remainder 2 by mod 9 are: 2, 11, 20, 29, ..., 999999992. 5.

(2) Substituting the parametric equations begin{cases} x=1+tcos alpha y=tsin alpha end{cases} into the circle's equation (x-2)^2+y^2 = 4 gives: (tcos alpha-1)^2+(tsin alpha)^2 = 4.

If we denote the vertices of the rectangle by (A, B, C, D) such that (A) and (C) lie on opposite vertices, then (AC) is the diameter and can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: [ AC = sqrt{24^2 + 7^2} = sqrt{576 + 49} = sqrt{625} = 25 text{ cm} ] Thus, the radius (R) of the circle is: [ R = frac{AC}{2} = frac{25}{2} = 12.5 text{ cm} ] 2. **Find the Midpoint of One of the Larger Arcs:** Let (M) be the midpoint of one of the larger arcs (BC).

This means the units digit of m must be 4 because subtracting a number ending in 0 (which 40n does) from a number and getting 24 as a result implies the units digit of the original number (m) is 4. 3. **Units digit of 40n:** Since 40n must end in 0 (because 40 ends in 0 and multiplication by n would not change the units digit), the subtraction does not affect the units digit's calculation for m. 4. **Tens digit calculation:** The tens digit of m being 8 and the result of the subtraction being 24 implies that the tens digit of 40n must effectively be 6 because 8 - 2 = 6. This is because the subtraction results in a number where the tens digit is 2 less than the tens digit of m, making the tens digit of 40n effectively 6 when considering the subtraction and the result. 5. **Finding possible values for n:** - When n=4, 40n = 40 times 4 = 160.

By circle geometry: [ angle PMQ = 180^circ - angle PCQ ] Substituting (angle PCQ = angle PAN): [ angle PMQ = 180^circ - angle PAN ] 6. We also have from our previous findings: [ angle PMQ = angle NMq = 180^circ - angle PMN ] 7. Hence, the agreement ( angle PMQ + angle QMN = 180^circ ) implies that ( M, N, ) and ( Q ) are collinear as the sums of angles around point ( M ) equal 180 degrees. Therefore, we can conclude that points ( M, N, ) and ( Q ) indeed lie on the same straight line. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A 900 m long train crosses a platform in 39 sec while it crosses a signal pole in a certain amount of time.

How long does it take for the train to cross the signal pole?","completion":"To find out how long it takes for the train to cross the signal pole, we need to determine the speed of the train first. We can do this by using the information given about the time it takes to cross the platform. When the train crosses the platform, it covers the distance equal to the length of the train plus the length of the platform. So the total distance covered when crossing the platform is: Distance = Length of train + Length of platform Distance = 900 m + 1050 m Distance = 1950 m We are given that the train crosses this distance in 39 seconds. So, the speed of the train (Speed = Distance / Time) is: Speed = 1950 m / 39 sec Speed = 50 m/sec Now, to find out how long it takes for the train to cross the signal pole, we only need to consider the length of the train, as the signal pole can be assumed to have negligible width compared to the length of the train.
