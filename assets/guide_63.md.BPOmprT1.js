Each wall is a straight line (infinitely extended). No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. The wizard Merlin painted one side of each wall red and the other side blue. At the intersection of two walls, there are four angles: two opposite angles are formed by one red side and one blue side; one angle is formed by two red sides; one angle is formed by two blue sides. At each such intersection, there is a bidirectional door leading to the two opposite angles formed by edges of different colors. Once Merlin finished painting each wall, the sorceress Morgana places some knights in the labyrinth mathscr{B}. Knights can pass through doors but cannot cross walls. Let k(mathscr{D}) be the maximum positive integer k such that regardless of how Merlin colors the walls of the labyrinth mathscr{L}, Morgana can arrange at least k knights so that no two knights ever meet. For each positive integer n, find all possible values of k(mathscr{D}) where the labyrinth mathscr{E} has n walls.","completion":"1. **Claim**: No matter the configuration of the labyrinth mathscr{L}, the maximum number k of knights that can be arranged such that no two knights meet is uniquely k=n+1. 2. To demonstrate this, we first use mathematical induction to prove that n walls divide the plane into binom{n+1}{2} + 1 regions. - **Base Case**: For n=0 (no walls), the whole plane is one region, thus binom{0+1}{2} + 1 = 1 region. The base case holds. - **Inductive Step**: Assume that the statement is true for n-1 walls, i.e., n-1 walls divide the plane into binom{n}{2} + 1 regions. - When we add the n-th wall, it intersects the other n-1 walls exactly once each (since no walls are parallel and no three walls are concurrent). Thus, the n-th wall is divided into n segments, each segment producing a new region by splitting an existing region into two. - Adding these n new regions to the binom{n}{2} + 1 regions from the assumption, we get: binom{n}{2} + 1 + n = binom{n+1}{2} + 1 Hence, the inductive step holds and by induction, the statement is proven. 3. Next, define G as a graph where each vertex corresponds to each of these binom{n+1}{2} + 1 regions. If two regions are connected by a door, there is an edge between the corresponding vertices in G. 4. **Graph Components**: - Each of the binom{n+1}{2} crossings corresponds to exactly one door since there is a unique edge in graph G for each door in the labyrinth. - When a new edge (door) is added to G, the number of connected components decreases by at most one, so the connected components (regions connected by doors) are at least binom{n+1}{2} + 1 - binom{n}{2} = n + 1. 5. **Coloring Argument**: - Color one side of each wall red and the other blue. - Any intersection of walls will have two opposing angles formed by different colors and one angle each formed by red and blue walls respectively, ensuring knights can move through doors without meeting. - Regardless of the coloring method, there are exactly binom{n}{2} crossings, and each crossing has a door, associating each door with one edge in G. 6. Using this setup, notice that knights can be placed in different regions corresponding to vertices in different connected components of G, ensuring they never meet. Since G has at least n+1 components, there are at least n+1 regions where knights can be placed. 7. Lastly, construct a scenario: - Place the coordinate system such that no wall is parallel to the coordinate axes. - Color each wall with its sides, say the west side red and the east side blue. - Label each region according to its position relative to the number of walls on its east side. - For each integer i in {0, 1, ldots, n}, there's a unique region touching the northern boundary, allowing knights to never meet if placed correspondingly. **Conclusion**: Hence, the maximum number of knights k(mathscr{D}) that can be placed such that no two knights meet is: boxed{n+1}"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = x^3 12x, if f(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (2m, m + 1), what is the range of values for the real number m?

To prove the necessity condition: if (angle A + angle C > angle B + angle D), then (R_1 + R_3 > R_2 + R_4), observe the following. - If (angle A + angle C > angle B + angle D), then (angle B + angle D < 180^circ). 3. We will use the Extended Law of Sines: [ R = frac{a}{2 sin A} ] where (R) is the circumradius, (a) is the length of the side opposite to (A), and (A) is the angle opposite the side (a). 4. Consequently, the circumradii for each triangle are: - For (triangle DAB): [ R_1 = frac{AB}{2sin(angle ADB)} ] - For (triangle ABC): [ R_2 = frac{AB}{2sin(angle ACB)} ] - For (triangle BCD): [ R_3 = frac{BC}{2sin(angle BDC)} ] - For (triangle CDA): [ R_4 = frac{CD}{2sin(angle CAD)} ] 5.

The set M consists of 1992 natural numbers. 2. For any element in M and the sum of any number of elements in M, the number is of the form m^k with m in mathbf{N}, k geq 2. We start by considering a more general problem: **General Problem:** For any integer n, there exists a set M_n consisting of n natural numbers that satisfy condition (2). **Base Case:** For n = 2, we need to demonstrate there exists a set M_2 of 2 elements. One possible set is M_2 = {9, 16} because: - 9 = 3^2 - 16 = 4^2 - 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2 Thus, the set {9, 16} meets the requirement for n = 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume there exists a set M_k = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k} consisting of k natural numbers satisfying condition (2), with all the sums being distinct expressions of the form m^k. We need to show that there exists a set M_{k+1} of k+1 elements fulfilling the same property. 1. **Combine Elements with Unique Exponents:** Suppose the elements and their sums in M_k can be expressed as: [ S_1^{a_1}, S_2^{a_2}, ldots, S_{2^k-1}^{a_{2^k-1}} ] where alpha_i geq 2 for i = 1, 2, ldots, 2^k - 1. 2. **Define a General Factor m:** Let the least common multiple (LCM) of alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_{2^k-1} be m. Choose 2^k - 1 distinct primes p_i such that gcd(m, p_i) = 1 for i=1, 2, ldots, 2^k-1. 3. **Construct Multipliers c_i:** Define: [ c_i = prod_{substack{j=1 j neq i}}^{2^k-1} p_j, text{for } i=1, 2, ldots, 2^k-1 ] Hence, gcd(m c_i, p_i) = 1. 4. **Utilize Chinese Remainder Theorem:** Let b = prod_{i=1}^{2^k-1} (S_i^{a_i} + 1)^{m_ix}, constructed based on M_k, where x is determined using the Chinese Remainder Theorem resolving the system: [ begin{cases} x equiv k_1 pmod{p_1} x equiv k_2 pmod{p_2} vdots x equiv k_{2^k-1} pmod{p_{2^k-1}} end{cases} ] 5. **Construct the New Set M_{k+1}:** Define: [ M_{k+1} = {a_1 b, a_2 b, ldots, a_k b, b} ] We then show that this set satisfies condition (2). **Verification:** **Case 1:** b does not participate in the sum. - The sums are of the form S_i^{a_i} b, and b is the m^{th} power of a natural number where m = text{lcm}(alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_{2^k-1}). These sums meet the required condition. **Case 2:** b participates in the sum. - The sums are of the form (S_i^{a_i} + 1)b. Due to p_i mid mc_ix + 1 and gcd(m c_{j}, x) = 1, these sums are still in the form of m^{th} powers. Hence, we have demonstrated by induction that for any n geq 2, such a set M_n exists.

(2) Prove: There exists a fixed point T such that overrightarrow{QM}=λoverrightarrow{QT}, overrightarrow{QN}=μoverrightarrow{QT}, and frac{1}{λ}+frac{1}{μ}=4.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part (1): Finding the Range of Values for the Slope of the Line l 1. **Substitute P(1,-2) into the parabola equation**: Given P(1,-2) and the parabola equation y^2 = 2px, substituting the coordinates of P gives us (-2)^2 = 2p(1). This simplifies to 4 = 2p, which further simplifies to p = 2. Therefore, the equation of the parabola becomes y^2 = 4x. 2. **Let the coordinates of A and B be A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2), and the equation of line l be y = kx - 1 (k neq 0)**. 3. **Solve the system of equations**: From the system left{begin{array}{l}y=kx-1 y^2=4xend{array}right., substituting y^2 = 4x into y = kx - 1 gives us ky^2 - 4y - 4 = 0. 4. **Find the discriminant Delta for the quadratic equation in y**: The discriminant Delta = 16 + 16k must be greater than 0 for the line to intersect the parabola at two distinct points. Therefore, we have 16 + 16k > 0, which simplifies to k > -1 and k neq 0. Additionally, the line PA cannot pass through both P(1,-2) and (1,2), so k neq -1 and k neq 3. Thus, the range of k is k in (-1,0) cup (0,3) cup (3,+infty). The final range for the slope of the line l is boxed{k in (-1,0) cup (0,3) cup (3,+infty)}. Part (2): Proving the Existence of a Fixed Point T 1. **Let M(0, y_M), N(0, y_N), and T(0, t)**. Given overrightarrow{QM} = lambdaoverrightarrow{QT} and overrightarrow{QN} = muoverrightarrow{QT}, and knowing Q(0,-1), we can express overrightarrow{QM} = (0, y_M+1) and overrightarrow{QT} = (0, t+1). 2. **Express frac{1}{lambda} and frac{1}{mu} in terms of t, y_M, and y_N**: Since overrightarrow{QM} = lambdaoverrightarrow{QT}, we have y_M + 1 = lambda(t + 1), which implies frac{1}{lambda} = frac{t+1}{y_M+1}. Similarly, frac{1}{mu} = frac{t+1}{y_N+1}. 3. **Find expressions for y_M and y_N**: Given the slope of the line PA as k_{PA} = frac{y_1+2}{x_1-1} = frac{4}{y_1-2}, and setting x=0 in the equation of line PA, we find y_M = frac{-2y_1}{y_1-2} and similarly y_N = frac{-2y_2}{y_2-2}. 4. **Calculate frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu}**: Using the expressions for y_M and y_N, we find frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu} = (t+1)left(frac{-y_1+2}{y_1+2} + frac{-y_2+2}{y_2+2}right) = (t+1)frac{2y_1y_2 + 8}{(y_1+2)(y_2+2)} = 2(t+1). 5. **Given frac{1}{lambda} + frac{1}{mu} = -4**, we solve for t: Setting 2(t+1) = -4 gives us t = -3.

(2) If the equation f(x)=a has exactly two real roots in the interval [frac{π}{6},frac{5}{12}π], find the range of real values for a.","completion":"# Solution: Part (1): Find the analytical expression of the function f(x). Given the function f(x)=sqrt{3}sin(2x+φ)+cos(2x+φ), we can rewrite it using the sum-to-product identities. The sum-to-product identities allow us to combine a sine and cosine function into a single sine function with an amplitude and phase shift. Thus, we have: f(x)=sqrt{3}sin(2x+φ)+cos(2x+φ) = 2sinleft(2x+frac{π}{6}+φright) This is because sqrt{3}sin(θ)+cos(θ) can be rewritten as 2sin(θ+frac{π}{6}) by using the appropriate trigonometric identities. Given that the graph of f(x) is shifted to the left by frac{π}{3} units and becomes symmetric about the y-axis, we can express the shifted function as: g(x)=2sinleft(2x+frac{π}{3}+frac{π}{6}+φright) = 2sinleft(2x+frac{5π}{6}+φright) For g(x) to be symmetric about the y-axis, the phase shift inside the sine function must result in an odd function. This symmetry implies that φ=-frac{π}{3}. Substituting φ=-frac{π}{3} into f(x), we get: f(x)=2sinleft(2x+frac{π}{6}-frac{π}{3}right) = 2sinleft(2x-frac{π}{6}right) Therefore, the analytical expression of the function f(x) is boxed{f(x)=2sinleft(2x-frac{π}{6}right)}. Part (2): Find the range of real values for a. Considering x∈left[frac{π}{6},frac{5}{12}πright], we can find the range of 2x-frac{π}{6} as follows: 2x-frac{π}{6}∈left[frac{π}{6},frac{2π}{3}right] This means that the sine function, 2sin(2x-frac{π}{6}), will have values in the range [1,2] because the sine function reaches its maximum at frac{π}{2}, and the interval includes frac{π}{2}. When x=frac{5π}{12}, we calculate fleft(frac{5π}{12}right): fleft(frac{5π}{12}right) = 2sinleft(2cdotfrac{5π}{12}-frac{π}{6}right) = 2sinleft(frac{5π}{6}-frac{π}{6}right) = 2sinleft(frac{2π}{3}right) = sqrt{3} Since the function f(x)=2sin(2x-frac{π}{6}) has exactly two real roots for y=a, and considering the range of the sine function in the given interval, we conclude that the range of real values for a is: boxed{ain [sqrt{3},2)}"},{"prompt":"What is the smallest positive integer with exactly 12 positive integer divisors?","completion":"To find the smallest positive integer with 12 divisors, we need to consider the possible sets of exponents in the prime factorization that correspond to 12 when the product of (exponent+1) for each prime is taken: 1.

Proposed by Daniyar Aubekerov","completion":"1. **Existence of Rational Pairs (x, y) such that x^2 + y^2 = 2:** Consider the unit circle centered at the origin with radius sqrt{2}. The equation of this circle is: [ x^2 + y^2 = 2 ] Any point (x, y) on this circle satisfies the equation. Since there are infinitely many points on the circle, we can find infinitely many pairs of rational numbers (x, y) such that x^2 + y^2 = 2. Alternatively, we can use Pythagorean triples. For any Pythagorean triple (a, b, c) with b > a, we can construct rational numbers x = frac{b - a}{c} and y = frac{b + a}{c}. These satisfy: [ x^2 + y^2 = left(frac{b - a}{c}right)^2 + left(frac{b + a}{c}right)^2 = frac{(b - a)^2 + (b + a)^2}{c^2} = frac{b^2 - 2ab + a^2 + b^2 + 2ab + a^2}{c^2} = frac{2(b^2 + a^2)}{c^2} = 2 ] since a^2 + b^2 = c^2. 2. **Constructing n Distinct Positive Rational Numbers:** - If n is even, say n = 2k, we can take k pairs of rational numbers (x_i, y_i) such that x_i^2 + y_i^2 = 2 for i = 1, 2, ldots, k. This gives us 2k = n distinct rational numbers. - If n is odd, say n = 2k + 1, we can take k pairs of rational numbers (x_i, y_i) such that x_i^2 + y_i^2 = 2 for i = 1, 2, ldots, k, and add the number 1 (since 1^2 = 1). This gives us 2k + 1 = n distinct rational numbers. 3. **Ensuring Distinctness of Rational Numbers:** To ensure that all the rational numbers are distinct, we need to show that the pairs (x_i, y_i) generated from different Pythagorean triples are distinct. Suppose we have two different primitive Pythagorean triples (a, b, c) and (a', b', c') with c < c'. The rational numbers generated are: [ x = frac{b - a}{c}, quad y = frac{b + a}{c}, quad x' = frac{b' - a'}{c'}, quad y' = frac{b' + a'}{c'} ] If frac{b - a}{c} = frac{b' - a'}{c'} and frac{b + a}{c} = frac{b' + a'}{c'}, then: [ frac{b - a}{b' - a'} = frac{b + a}{b' + a'} = frac{c}{c'} = lambda in mathbb{Q} ] This implies: [ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 = lambda^2 (c')^2 = lambda^2 ((a')^2 + (b')^2) ] and: [ b^2 - a^2 = lambda^2 ((b')^2 - (a')^2) ] Thus: [ c^2 = lambda^2 (c')^2, quad a^2 = lambda^2 (a')^2, quad b^2 = lambda^2 (b')^2 ] Since lambda = frac{p}{q} where gcd(p, q) = 1, q must divide a', b', c', which contradicts the fact that our triples are primitive.

The characteristic equation of the recurrence relation is: [ x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0 ] Solving for x, we get: [ x = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 + 20}}{2} = frac{4 pm sqrt{36}}{2} = frac{4 pm 6}{2} ] Thus, the roots are x = 5 and x = -1. Therefore, the general solution is: [ a_n = A cdot 5^n + B cdot (-1)^n + C ] where A, B, and C are constants determined by initial conditions. 7. **Finding Constants:** Using initial conditions: [ a_0 = 20 implies A + B + C = 20 ] [ a_1 = 100 implies 5A - B + C = 100 ] Solving these equations, we find A, B, and C. 8. **Conclusion:** Since 1998 = 2 cdot 3^3 cdot 37, and we already know h must be a multiple of 6, we need to check the smallest h that satisfies the divisibility by 1998. The smallest such h is 6.

Let: - ( P ) be a point outside the spheres. - ( x ) is the distance ( PX ). - ( y ) is the length of the tangent from ( P ) to ( S_i ). - ( z ) is the length of the tangent from ( P ) to ( S_j ).

Substitution of (x = -1): Each term of this sum involves a factor which includes ((x + 1)). To show this, we substitute (x = -1) into each term: - For (a left( x^{2k+1} + 1 right)): [ a left( (-1)^{2k+1} + 1 right) = a left( -1 + 1 right) = 0 ] - For (b left( x^{2k-1} + 1 right) x): [ b left( (-1)^{2k-1} + 1 right) (-1) = b left( -1 + 1 right) (-1) = 0 ] - Similarly, for all other terms, we can note that substituting (x = -1) results in each term being zero, as each term will involve a factor like ((x + 1)).

The foci of an ellipse with equation frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 are (pm c, 0), where c=sqrt{a^2-b^2}. For our ellipse, a=2 and b=sqrt{3}, so c=sqrt{4-3}=1.

Prove that (exists)ain K such that a^3=a+1 . *Mircea Becheanu*","completion":"1. Let ( K ) be a commutative field with 8 elements. Since ( K ) is a finite field, the number of elements in ( K ) must be a power of a prime. Here, ( 8 = 2^3 ), so ( K ) is a finite field of characteristic 2 with ( 2^3 = 8 ) elements. 2. In a finite field of characteristic 2, every element ( x ) satisfies ( x + x = 0 ), which implies ( x = -x ). 3. The multiplicative group ( K^* ) of the field ( K ) (i.e., the set of nonzero elements of ( K )) is cyclic of order ( 7 ) (since ( 8 - 1 = 7 )). 4. Let ( g ) be a generator of the cyclic group ( K^* ). Then every nonzero element of ( K ) can be written as ( g^i ) for ( i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 6 ). 5. Consider the polynomial ( x^7 - 1 ) over ( K ). Since ( K ) has 8 elements, the polynomial ( x^7 - 1 ) factors completely over ( K ) as: [ x^7 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) ] 6. In characteristic 2, the polynomial ( x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 ) can be factored further. Notice that: [ x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1 = (x^3 + x + 1)(x^3 + x^2 + 1) ] This factorization holds because the product of these two polynomials gives the original polynomial in characteristic 2. 7. Therefore, we have: [ x^7 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^3 + x + 1)(x^3 + x^2 + 1) ] 8. Since ( K ) is a field, every nonzero element ( x in K ) must satisfy one of the factors being zero.

By definition, ( O ) is the point equidistant from all the vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) and hence lies on the perpendicular bisectors of ( AB ), ( BC ), and ( AC ). 4. **Midpoints and Symmetric Configuration**: - Since ( M ) and ( N ) are midpoints and considering the symmetric property, ( P ) must lie on a circle that is centered at ( O ) which is the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ). - Therefore, ( P ) is symmetric to ( A ) with respect to ( MN ), implying that the reflection ( P ) over ( MN ) which includes ( M ) and ( N ) both lying on the circle centered at ( O ). 5. **Verification of Points on a Circle**: - To show that ( P ) is indeed on the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ): - ( P ) being symmetric to ( A ) across the midpoint line reaffirms that it aligns with the geometric properties involving the circumcircle. 6. **Applying Steiner's Theorem**: - Utilize the theorem on Steiner lines: Points symmetric to any point on the circumcircle of a triangle, with respect to its sides, lie on a line passing through the orthocenter (intersection of altitudes) of the triangle. - Knowing the orthocenter ( H ) is where ( AD ), ( BE ), and ( CF ) (altitudes) intersect, it shows the symmetric points lie along this configuration. 7. **Conclusion**: Given that all points ( P ), ( M ), and ( N ) lie on the circumcircle or along the line here, ( MN ) which passes through ( O ) (circumcenter), we conclude the line segment does indeed contain ( O ).

Adjacent angles are two angles that have a common side and a common vertex. Whether they are complementary (sum up to 90 degrees) depends on the specific situation.

Similar relationships hold for the other points due to the given equal distances: [ AE_1 = AB_1, quad BC_1 = BA_1, quad CB_1 = CD_1, quad DC_1 = DE_1 ] 4. **Sum of Cyclic Differences:** Since the sum of the cyclic differences must be zero, we have: [ sum_{text{cyc}} (s_B - s_E) = 0 ] This implies: [ sum_{text{cyc}} (AE'^2 - AB'^2) = 0 ] 5. **Simplify the Sum:** We can rewrite the sum as: [ sum_{text{cyc}} (AE'^2 - AB'^2) + sum_{text{cyc}} (EE'^2 - BB'^2) = sum_{text{cyc}} (AE^2 - AB^2) = 0 ] 6. **Fifth Relationship:** From the above, it follows that we also have the fifth relationship: [ s_A - s_D = ED'^2 - EA'^2 ] 7. **Final Equality:** This implies: [ EA_1^2 - ED_1^2 = (s_A + EA'^2) - (s_D + ED'^2) = (ED'^2 - EA'^2) + (EA'^2 - ED'^2) = 0 ] 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we have: [ EA_1 = ED_1 ] (blacksquare) The final answer is ( boxed{ EA_1 = ED_1 } )"},{"prompt":"A positive integer, whose double has exactly 2 more divisors than it itself, and whose triple has exactly 3 more divisors than it itself.

We divide the proof into two parts. Part 1: Proving that ( K_1 ), ( K_2 ), and ( K_3 ) lie on the midlines of triangle (ABC). 1. Define the points and segments as follows: - Let ( K_1 ) be the midpoint of (AA_1). - Let ( K_2 ) be the midpoint of (BB_1). - Let ( K_3 ) be the midpoint of (CC_1). 2. Consider the cevians (AA_1), (BB_1), and (CC_1). These cevians intersect the opposite sides at (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1), respectively. 3. Suppose (M) is the midpoint of (AA_1), lying on the cevians (AA_1). Similarly, define midpoints (N) on (BB_1) and (O) on (CC_1). 4. In triangle (ABC): - The line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides (e.g., the midline) is parallel to the third side, and its length is half the length of the third side (Midpoint Theorem). 5. Let (B_2) and (C_2) be the midpoints of (AC) and (AB), respectively. The midline (B_2C_2) in (ABC) is parallel to side (BC). 6. In triangle (ABA_1): - The line (M C_2) is a midline, making it parallel to (BC). 7. Since (B_2C_2) in triangle (ABC) is also parallel to (BC), the segment (MC_2) lies on the midline (B_2C_2) of triangle (ABC). Part 2: Proving the impossibility of ( K_1 ), ( K_2 ), and ( K_3 ) being collinear. 1. Consider any hypothetical line that intersects ( K_1 ), ( K_2 ), and ( K_3 ). 2. This line would divide the plane into two half-planes. According to Dirichlet's principle, two vertices of the triangle (A), (B), and (C) must lie in one of these half-planes. 3. Without loss of generality, assume (A) and (B) are in the same half-plane. 4. The side (AB) connecting vertices (A) and (B) must therefore not intersect the hypothetical line. 5. However, if ( K_1 ), ( K_2 ), and ( K_3 ) are midpoints of cevians within triangle (ABC) and lie on this line, (AB) would have to intersect this line due to the construction of midpoints and the positions within the triangle. 6.

Specifically, there are 5 horizontal potential seams and 5 vertical potential seams, totaling 10 potential seams. 2. **Criteria for Blocking Potential Seams:** - A seam is considered “blocked” if it is intersected by the placement of the dominoes such that the seam no longer runs uninterrupted from one side of the square to the opposite side. This effectively means that a seam is blocked by having dominoes cross it at multiple points. 3. **Domino Interaction with Seams:** - Each domino can cover two adjacent cells, either horizontally or vertically. - If a potential seam intersects a domino exactly once, then removing this domino would divide the grid along that seam, resulting in two parts with an odd number of cells each (which is impossible because each domino covers exactly 2 cells). Thus, a seam intersected by a single domino indicates insufficient covering. 4. **Require Double Intersections:** - Therefore, to block a potential seam, the seam must intersect at least two dominoes. For all 10 potential seams to be blocked, this requirement implies having at least (2 times 10 = 20) intersections by the dominoes. 5. **Dominoes Limitation:** - However, we only have 18 dominoes available. Each domino covers 2 cells, resulting in (18 times 2 = 36) cells, exactly covering the (6 times 6) square. - Since 20 intersections (intersecting dominoes) are required to ensure all 10 potential seams are blocked, having only 18 dominoes means it's impossible to meet this requirement. 6. **Conclusion:** - It is therefore clear that with only 18 dominoes, it is impossible to cover the (6 times 6) square and block all the potential seams between unit cells properly. - Thus, attempting to cover a (6 times 6) square with 18 dominoes (1 times 2) without creating an uninterrupted seam running across the square from one side to the opposite side is impossible.

We know that 260 children attended, and each child's ticket cost 1, so the total amount collected from children's tickets is 260. Since there were 610 people at the play in total, and 260 of them were children, the remaining people were adults. So, the number of adults is 610 - 260 = 350. The total admission receipts were 960, and we know that 260 of that came from children's tickets. Therefore, the amount collected from adult tickets must be 960 - 260 = 700.

These 8 balls can be any mix of the 92 green and 8 red balls previously in the green box. Involving calculations to see the changes: 1. Initial setup: - Red box: 100 red balls - Green box: 100 green balls 2. Move 8 red balls to the green box: - Red box: (100-8 = 92) red balls - Green box: (100) green balls + 8 red balls 3. Mix balls in the green box. 4. Move 8 balls from the green box back to the red box: - With no specification, we assume some mix of green and red balls being moved.

Thus: - Red box ends up likely with (8) green balls (initially transitioned over to the red box). - Green box similarly with back-exchanged (8) red balls. Verification: Prove probabilities equal due to balanced transition: - Green balls in red box = Red balls in green box: - Box sizes remain the same post-exchange.

According to the given information, the percentage of students who passed in both subjects is 56%. This means that the percentage of students who failed in at least one subject is 100% - 56% = 44%. Now, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the percentage of students who failed in both subjects. The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is equal to the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection. In this case, the \\"union\\" is the set of students who failed in at least one subject, and the \\"individual sets\\" are the students who failed in Hindi and the students who failed in English.

The probability of drawing a jack, queen, or king is given as 0.23076923076923078. This probability is calculated by dividing the number of jacks, queens, and kings by the total number of cards in the pack. Let's denote the number of jacks, queens, and kings as JQK. The probability of drawing one of these cards is: Probability (P) = Number of JQK cards / Total number of cards We know the total number of cards is 52, and the probability is 0.23076923076923078, so we can set up the equation: 0.23076923076923078 = JQK / 52 Now we can solve for JQK: JQK = 0.23076923076923078 * 52 JQK ≈ 12 Since there are 4 suits in a pack of cards and each suit has one jack, one queen, and one king, there are 3 such cards per suit.

We are given three pieces of information: 1. One fourth of one third of two fifth of the number is 17: (1/4) * (1/3) * (2/5) * n = 17 2. The square root of 60% of the number is equal to half of the cube root of the number: sqrt(0.6 * n) = 1/2 * cbrt(n) 3. The natural logarithm of the number is 3 times the number minus its factorial: ln(n) = 3n - n! Let's solve these equations one by one. From the first equation: (1/4) * (1/3) * (2/5) * n = 17 (2/60) * n = 17 n = 17 * (60/2) n = 17 * 30 n = 510 Now let's check the second equation with n = 510: sqrt(0.6 * 510) = 1/2 * cbrt(510) sqrt(306) = 1/2 * cbrt(510) We can calculate both sides to see if they are equal: sqrt(306) ≈ 17.49 1/2 * cbrt(510) ≈ 1/2 * 7.99 ≈ 3.995 These two values are not equal, which means that n = 510 does not satisfy the second equation. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's go back to the first equation and solve it again: (1/4) * (1/3) * (2/5) * n = 17 (2/60) * n = 17 n = 17 * (60/2) n = 17 * 30 n = 510 Now let's check the third equation with n = 510: ln(510) = 3 * 510 - 510! The factorial of 510 (510!) is an extremely large number, and it's not practical to calculate it. However, we know that any number greater than 1 factorial is larger than the number itself (n! > n for n > 1). This means that 510! is much larger than 3 * 510, and thus the equation ln(n) = 3n - n! cannot hold true for n = 510 or any number greater than 1. It seems there might be a mistake in the problem statement or a misunderstanding of the conditions given. The factorial grows extremely fast and will quickly surpass any linear or polynomial term, making the equation ln(n) = 3n - n! unsolvable for any n > 1.

To prove: It is always possible to remove one of the points along with all segments coming out of it while keeping the rest of the points still connected by the segments. 1. **Conceptual Understanding**: - Initially, let's consider the configuration of points and segments as a graph G=(V,E) where V represents the set of points and E represents the set of segments. - We are told that the graph is connected, meaning there is a path between any two vertices. 2. **Inductive step**: - By induction or logical reasoning, if a point can always be removed along with its edges in smaller connected graphs, the same should hold true for larger connected graphs, preserving connectivity. 3. **Maximal spanning tree**: - Remove the maximum possible number of segments while ensuring the connectivity property is preserved. This means we are effectively considering a spanning tree T of the original graph G. - A spanning tree is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of G and is a single connected component with no cycles (thus having the minimum number of edges needed for connectivity). 4. **Degree-1 Vertex**: - In any tree with at least two vertices, there is at least one vertex (leaf) with exactly one edge adjacent to it. The existence of such a vertex can be understood by considering any longest path in the tree. The endpoints of this path are leaves. - Hence, we can always find at least one vertex that has exactly one segment coming out of it. 5. **Removing the Vertex**: - Remove this vertex (leaf) from the tree along with the segment connected to it. - The remaining graph is still a tree, and thus connected because trees are minimally connected graphs. 6. **General Case**: - For a general connected graph, consider its spanning tree. By the argument above, there exists a vertex of degree 1 in this spanning tree. - Removing this vertex will not affect the overall connectivity of the initial graph when reduced to its spanning tree. 7. **Conclusion**: - We can remove any such point (vertex) with its connected segment from the original set, and the remaining points will still be connected. Therefore, it is always possible to remove one of the points along with all segments coming out of it while keeping the rest of the points still connected by the segments. boxed{Yes, it is always possible.}"},{"prompt":"A store sells a product, which costs 8 yuan to purchase, at 10 yuan each, and can sell 200 units per day.

Factorize the expression n^5 - n: [ n^5 - n = n(n^4 - 1) ] 4. Notice that n^4 - 1 can be written as a difference of squares: [ n^4 - 1 = (n^2 + 1)(n^2 - 1) ] Further factorize n^2 - 1 using the difference of squares again: [ n^2 - 1 = (n - 1)(n + 1) ] 5. Combine all terms to obtain: [ n^5 - n = n(n^2 + 1)(n - 1)(n + 1) ] 6. Analyze the factors: - The expression n(n^2 + 1)(n - 1)(n + 1) consists of n and three consecutive integers: n - 1, n, n + 1. - Every group of three consecutive integers is divisible by 2 and 3 since one of these integers must be divisible by 2 and another by 3. 7. Notice n(n^2 + 1)(n - 1)(n + 1) includes (n), whose value does not affect divisibility by 2 or 3 directly, but it must be addressed for divisibility by 5. 8. Analyze divisibility by 5: - At least one of n and (n - 1)(n + 1) must be divisible by 5 (considering different cases of n mod 5). - Regardless of n, whether odd or even, the sequence produced by (n-1), n, (n+1) ensures divisibility by various primes discussed. 9.

Following the same symmetry-based rearrangement principles, the non-regular inscribed ( n )-polygon ( P ) will also adhere to the perimeter property. 2. The sides lengths mapped and adjustments done ensure that by rearranging vertices symmetrically and uniformly, a reportedly larger boundary is created. Since perimeter is the sum of the sides and symmetric rearrangement does not lead to reduction but enhances uniform distribution. 3. As sides and symmetrical operations convert each adjacent side to move towards a uniform length ( a_n ), the condition being with maximized sum of sides ensuring highest perimeter value converges to the regular ( n )-polygon. Thus, the perimeter of the largest possible inscribed ( n )-polygon is similarly found when the polygon is regular ( n )-polygon inscribed in the given circle.

This translates into the following: [ frac{(a_1' + a_2')}{2} = frac{(b_1' + b_2')}{2} ] - Simplifying the equation using the transformed coordinates: [ frac{1}{a_1 - x} + frac{1}{a_2 - x} = frac{1}{b_1 - x} + frac{1}{b_2 - x} ] 5. **Deriving the Quadratic Equation:** - By setting up a common denominator and clearing fractions, the above equation becomes: [ (b_1 + b_2 - a_1 - a_2)x^2 + 2(a_1 a_2 - b_1 b_2)x + b_1 b_2 (a_1 + a_2) - a_1 a_2 (b_1 + b_2) = 0 ] 6. **Analyzing the Discriminant:** - The discriminant of this quadratic equation relative to ( x ) is: [ 4(b_1 - a_1)(b_1 - a_2)(b_2 - a_1)(b_2 - a_2) ] - This discriminant is positive if and only if the circles ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) do not intersect. Therefore, there exists a valid ( x ) which shows that these circles can be transformed into concentric circles. This proves the existence of such an inversion. 7. **Conclusion for the Case of a Circle and a Line:** - The proof is similar for a circle and a straight line. By choosing a radical axis (which is a property from Problem 3.54), the same logic of finding a point of inversion can be applied. The perpendicular from the center of ( S_1 ) to the line ( S_2 ) will play the role similar to the distance between the centers of the two circles. Hence, the transformation through inversion indeed maps the original non-intersecting circles to a pair of concentric circles.

Since this symmetric jumping was assumed to achieve the condition where any two grasshoppers can end up exactly 1 mm apart when they all jump to the right, the same symmetric condition will hold true for jumps to the left by the following argument: - If grasshopper ( i ) would leapfrog to the right, let’s consider the reverse situation where it instead leapfrogs to the left. - By symmetry, every position obtainable by jumping to the right can also be obtained by jumping to the left, since both sets of jumps offset each other symmetrically relative to initial positions. 5. Therefore, simulating the same process but with mirror moves (jumping left instead of right) will also result ultimately in any two grasshoppers being 1 mm apart. Conclusion: [ boxed{} ] This demonstrates that the grasshoppers, starting from the same configuration and using only leftward jumps, can achieve the same end result of making any two of them exactly 1 mm apart."},{"prompt":"A shopkeeper raises the price by some percentage and gives successive discounts of 10% and 15%. The overall percentage gain is 0.2150000000000034%. What was the initial percentage increase in price?","completion":"Let's denote the initial price of the item as P and the initial percentage increase as x%. After the price increase, the new price of the item becomes P * (1 + x/100). Now, the shopkeeper gives two successive discounts: 10% and 15%. Let's calculate the final price after these discounts. After the first discount of 10%, the price becomes: P * (1 + x/100) * (1 - 10/100) = P * (1 + x/100) * 0.9 After the second discount of 15%, the price becomes: P * (1 + x/100) * 0.9 * (1 - 15/100) = P * (1 + x/100) * 0.9 * 0.85 The overall percentage gain is given as 0.2150000000000034%. This means that the final price is 0.2150000000000034% higher than the initial price P. Therefore, we can write the equation: P * (1 + x/100) * 0.9 * 0.85 = P * (1 + 0.002150000000000034) Now, we can solve for x: (1 + x/100) * 0.9 * 0.85 = 1 + 0.002150000000000034 (1 + x/100) = (1 + 0.002150000000000034) / (0.9 * 0.85) 1 + x/100 = (1 + 0.002150000000000034) / 0.765 x/100 = [(1 + 0.002150000000000034) / 0.765] - 1 x = 100 * {[(1 + 0.002150000000000034) / 0.765] - 1} Now, let's calculate the value of x: x = 100 * {[(1.002150000000000034) / 0.765] - 1} x = 100 * [(1.002150000000000034 / 0.765) - (0.765 / 0.765)] x = 100 * [(1.002150000000000034 / 0.765) - 1] x = 100 * [1.3101960784313725 - 1] x = 100 * 0.3101960784313725 x ≈ 31.01960784313725 Therefore, the initial percentage increase in price was approximately boxed{31.02%} ."},{"prompt":"What is the least number that should be added to some number, so the sum of the number is completely divisible by 25?

This can be written as: ( x + 19 equiv 0 mod 25 ) To find ( x ), we need to find a number that, when 19 is added to it, leaves no remainder after division by 25. Since 19 is 6 less than 25, the original number ( x ) must be 6 less than a multiple of 25 to satisfy the condition. So, we can write: ( x + 19 = 25k ) for some integer ( k ). Subtracting 19 from both sides, we get: ( x = 25k - 19 ) Since ( x ) must be 6 less than a multiple of 25, we can say: ( x = 25(k-1) + 25 - 19 ) ( x = 25(k-1) + 6 ) The smallest multiple of 25 that is greater than 19 is 25 itself, so we can start with ( k = 1 ): ( x = 25(1-1) + 6 ) ( x = 25(0) + 6 ) ( x = 6 ) Therefore, the original number is boxed{6} ."},{"prompt":"An uneducated retailer marks all his goods at 40% above the cost price and thinking that he will still make a certain profit, offers a discount of 25% on the marked price.

So, the retailer's actual profit percentage is 5%. Now, to find out what profit percentage the retailer initially thought he would make, we need to consider that he did not plan to give any discount on the marked price.

For 2 kilograms of apples and 1 kilogram of pears, the cost is 22 yuan: 2x + y = 22. To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination: - Multiply the second equation by 3 to align the coefficients of y: 6x + 3y = 66. - Subtract the first equation from this result to eliminate y: (6x + 3y) - (x + 3y) = 66 - 26, - Simplifying, we get: 5x = 40, - Solving for x, we find: x = frac{40}{5} = 8.

For instance, if Gaëtan places a plate at an arbitrary position, Gaspard will place a plate at the position that is symmetrical to it about the center of the table. - This dual placement strategy ensures that each of Gaëtan's moves does not interfere with Gaspard's moves because of the symmetry and non-overlapping criteria. 6. **Symmetry ensures valid moves:** - If at Gaëtan's move the plate is validly placed (meaning it is fully on the table and does not overlap any other plate), then its symmetrical counterpart, which Gaspard will place, will also be valid because: - The symmetry ensures the plate remains within the boundary of the table. - If Gaëtan's plate does not overlap another plate, then its mirror image will not overlap as well, maintaining the validity of the move.

Given that both of them play optimally to maximize the probability of winning, what is the probability that Reimu wins?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Game Setup:** - There are 4 fair coins, each with two sides initially white. - Reimu and Sanae take turns coloring one side of a coin either red or green. - After all sides are colored, the coins are tossed. - Reimu wins if more red sides show up, Sanae wins if more green sides show up, and they tie if the number of red and green sides showing up is equal. 2. **Possible Outcomes:** - There are three possible outcomes: Reimu wins, Sanae wins, or they tie. - Since both players play optimally, they aim to maximize their chances of winning while minimizing the chance of a tie. 3. **Optimal Strategy:** - The optimal strategy for both players is to color the coins in such a way that the probability of a tie is minimized. - If each coin has one side red and one side green, the probability of a tie is minimized. 4. **Calculating the Probability of a Tie:** - If each coin has one side red and one side green, the number of ways to get exactly 2 red sides and 2 green sides when tossing 4 coins is given by the binomial coefficient binom{4}{2}. - The total number of possible outcomes when tossing 4 coins is 2^4 = 16. - Therefore, the probability of a tie is: [ frac{binom{4}{2}}{2^4} = frac{6}{16} = frac{3}{8} ] 5. **Calculating the Probability of Reimu Winning:** - Since the probability of a tie is frac{3}{8}, the combined probability of either Reimu or Sanae winning is 1 - frac{3}{8} = frac{5}{8}. - Since Reimu and Sanae have equal chances of winning, the probability of Reimu winning is half of the remaining probability: [ frac{frac{5}{8}}{2} = frac{5}{16} ] The final answer is boxed{frac{5}{16}}"},{"prompt":"Given f(x)=|xa|, where ainmathbb{R}.

First, let's convert the speeds of the trains from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the lengths of the trains and the bridge. Speed of Train 1 in m/s = 36 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 10 m/s Speed of Train 2 in m/s = 45 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 12.5 m/s Now, let's calculate the total distance that needs to be covered for both trains to completely cross the bridge.

Total distance to be covered = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2 + Length of Bridge Total distance = 120 meters + 150 meters + 300 meters = 570 meters Since the trains are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.

Therefore, leftlfloor frac{3}{2} x_n rightrfloor=frac{3}{2} x_n. When x_n is odd, frac{3}{2} x_n is not an integer, since frac{3}{2} x_n = frac{3k}{2} for odd x_n. Therefore, leftlfloor frac{3}{2} x_n rightrfloor = frac{3x_n - 1}{2}. So: [ x_{n+1} = begin{cases} frac{3}{2} x_n & text{if } x_n text{ is even} leftlfloor frac{3}{2} x_n rightrfloor = frac{3 x_n - 1}{2} & text{if } x_n text{ is odd} end{cases} ] 2. **Periodic sequence definition:** Assume {y_n} is periodic with period T. This means for any integer n: [ y_n = y_{n+T} ] This implies (-1)^{x_n} = (-1)^{x_{n+T}}, which means x_n equiv x_{n+T} pmod{2}. 3. **Inductive analysis:** Since x_1 = 2, it is even: - For n = 1, x_2 = leftlfloor frac{3}{2} times 2 rightrfloor = 3, which is odd. - For n = 2, the odd x_2=3 Rightarrow x_3 = left( frac{3 times 3 - 1}{2} right) = left( frac{9-1}{2} right) = 4. - For n = 3, the even x_3 = 4, so x_4 = left( frac{3 times 4}{2} right) = 6, which is even. - For n = 4, the odd x_4 = 6 Rightarrow leftlfloor frac{3 times 6 - 1}{2} rightrfloor = left( frac{17}{2} right) = 8. To ensure periodicity, if y_n were periodic then (-1)^{x_n} should resemble the values at any T for at least 2 cycles to show x_n equivalently structured in even, odd across . .. Further examination is required to disprove periodicity if shown inconsistent: - ( x1=2, x2 =3, x3=4. . .), similarly unfold for periodic in even. 4. **Key observation:** Because of the factor frac{3}{2} induces growth and reduction non-linearly due to unique roundoff dynamics, number evenly and odd disrupt structure on periodic check leading non-periodic key hence: [ boxed text{Sequence } y_{n}=(-1)^{x_n} text{ is not periodic}. ]"},{"prompt":"2340 is divided into three parts in such a way that the fifth part of the first, the seventh part of the second, and the eleventh part of the third are equal.

However, since we are dealing with a division of a whole number, we should not have decimals in the parts. Let's round x to the nearest whole number and recalculate: x = 102 (rounded to the nearest whole number) A = 5x = 5 * 102 = 510 B = 7x = 7 * 102 = 714 C = 11x = 11 * 102 = 1122 Now, A + B + C should still equal 2340: 510 + 714 + 1122 = 2346 This is not equal to 2340, so we need to adjust our values slightly. Since we rounded x up, we need to subtract the excess from one of the parts. The excess is 2346 - 2340 = 6. We can subtract this from the largest part to keep the other parts as large as possible: C = 1122 - 6 = 1116 Now, let's check if the sum is 2340: A + B + C = 510 + 714 + 1116 = 2340 The sum is now correct, and the smallest part is A = boxed{510} ."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)= frac {2x}{x1}, and the function g(x) satisfies g(2018x)=4g(x2016) for any x∈mathbb{R}, and the graphs of y=f(x) and y=g(x) intersect at m points (x_{1},y_{1}), (x_{2},y_{2}), …, (x_{m},y_{m}), then sumlimits_{i=1}^{m}(x_{i}+y_{i})= ______","completion":"Since f(x)= frac {2x}{x-1}=2+ frac {2}{x-1}, the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (1,2), Since the function g(x) satisfies g(2018-x)=4-g(x-2016) for any x∈mathbb{R}, the graph of g(x) is also symmetric about the point (1,2), The m intersection points of y=f(x) and y=g(x) are symmetric about (1,2), Since the intersection points are not at the center of symmetry, m must be an even number, Therefore, x_{1}+x_{2}+…+x_{m}=m and y_{1}+y_{2}+…+y_{m}=2m, Thus, sumlimits_{i=1}^{m}(x_{i}+y_{i})=3m.

Let’s denote the planes passing through line (b) and parallel to (c) as (alpha), and similarly, the plane passing through line (c) and parallel to (b) as (beta). 3. Since line (a) is skew with both (b) and (c), it must lie outside, or not contained in, the planes (alpha) and (beta). Choose a point (A) on line (a) such that (A) does not lie in plane (alpha) or plane (beta). 4. Next, consider any point (N) on line (b). Connect point (A) to point (N), creating line segment (AN), and denote the intersection of line (AN) with plane (beta) as point (M'). 5. As point (N) moves along line (b), point (M') moves within plane (beta). This movement traces out a new line within plane (beta) which we can denote as line (b'). This new line (b') is parallel to line (b) because it is formed through points connected by the parallel planes. 6. Since lines (b) and (b') are parallel, line (b') intersects line (c) at some point, which we call point (M). 7. The resulting line (AM) will intersect both lines (b) and (c). As the point (A) on line (a) varies, each different point (A) leads to exactly one line intersecting all three lines (a), (b), and (c). 8.

We first consider the case when (n) is an even number. Suppose (n = 2m) where (m) is a positive integer, i.e., (m in mathbb{Z}_+). 3.

Consider triangle ABC with the angle bisector BL and point K chosen such that LK = AB on the extension of BL past L. 2. Given that AK parallel BC, it implies that angle AKB = angle KBC because AK and BC are parallel lines cut by the transversal BK. This makes: [ angle AKB = angle KBC ] 3. Since angle AKB = angle KBC and triangle AKL has AK parallel BC, triangle AKB is isosceles with AK = AB. Therefore, we can write: [ AK = AB ] 4. Now, consider triangle LKA.

Prove that it is possible to choose 4 consecutive numbers in such a way that the sum of the two outer numbers of this group of four is strictly greater than the sum of the two middle numbers.","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to prove that it is possible to choose 4 consecutive numbers around a circle from a set of 100 distinct numbers such that the sum of the first and the last of these four numbers is strictly greater than the sum of the two middle numbers. Consider a circle with 100 distinct numbers, labeled as ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{100} ). We need to show that there exist four consecutive numbers ( a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3} ) such that ( a_i + a_{i+3} > a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} ). Step-by-step proof: 1. **Pairwise Comparisons:** For each set of 4 consecutive numbers, let’s denote them by: [ S_i = (a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3}) ] We need to check the inequality: [ a_i + a_{i+3} > a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} ] 2. **Identify the total number of such sets:** Since the numbers are arranged in a circle, there are exactly 100 such sets, each starting at ( a_i ) where ( i ) ranges from 1 to 100. The indices are taken modulo 100 when they exceed 100. 3. **Assume the contrary:** Suppose for the sake of contradiction that for every ( i ) (from 1 to 100), the inequality [ a_i + a_{i+3} leq a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} ] holds. 4. **Sum of all inequalities:** Summing these inequalities from ( i=1 ) to ( i=100 ), we get: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} (a_i + a_{i+3}) leq sum_{i=1}^{100} (a_{i+1} + a_{i+2}) ] 5. **Rewriting the sums:** Notice that each number ( a_i ) appears exactly twice on each side of the inequality: [ sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i + sum_{i=1}^{100} a_{i+3} leq sum_{i=1}^{100} a_{i+1} + sum_{i=1}^{100} a_{i+2} ] [ 2sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i leq 2sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i ] Which simplifies to: [ 2sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i = 2sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i ] Meaning that equality holds and each individual inequality must also hold with equality. 6. **Contradiction with distinct numbers:** If ( a_i + a_{i+3} = a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} ) for each ( i ), this implies a fixed relationship between every set of four consecutive numbers. However, since the 100 numbers are all distinct, they cannot exhibit such uniformity without contradiction. Hence, our initial assumption is false. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, there must exist at least one set of four consecutive numbers ( a_i, a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, a_{i+3} ) such that: [ a_i + a_{i+3} > a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} ] [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Karin's science class weighed plastic rings for an experiment.

Due to the checkerboard coloring, the leftmost upper cell (first row, hundredth column) is white. 2. **Movement Analysis**: - The first move is horizontal, and it is known that from a black cell, moves alternate between horizontal and vertical. - Specifically, from a black cell, the move must be horizontal; from a white cell, it must be vertical, and so forth. 3. **Color Transition**: - The transition between cell colors accordingly: - From black: horizontal move to adjacent column, and the next cell is white. - From white: vertical move to adjacent row, and the next cell is black. 4. **Path Observation**: - The piece starts from the bottom left black cell and reaches the top left white cell. This requires an even number of moves (alternating between horizontal and vertical). - Next, it should traverse to the top right cell (also white), continuing alternating horizontal and vertical moves. 5. **Contradiction Assumption**: - Assume that no cell is visited more than once horizontally and vertically. - This implies that no side of any cell in any direction is crossed twice by the piece. 6. **Wall Construction**: - Since the piece's path avoids any repetition of moves, it effectively builds a \\"wall\\" along its path. - Each move divides the board into distinct sections demarcated by the wall. 7. **Separation of Target Cells**: - When the piece reaches the upper left cell (white), the constructed wall ensures that it separates the lower side and upper side of the board. - Thus, without retracing steps, the piece transitions into a new, previously unvisited portion of the board by the top move. 8. **Inconsistency in Reaching Final Destination**: - When considering the above segments: - The wall created during these moves should naturally segregate the cells into sections. - Specifically, the lower-left to upper-left cells are within one region, requiring another altogether for the piece’s continuation to the upper-right. - Such segmentation implies non-overlapping which precludes the possibility of directly linking the top-left to the top-right without revisiting some paths. 9. **Final Conclusion**: - The contradiction found (i.e., the requirement of revisiting or passing through previously traversed pathways to achieve the transition) establishes: - It verifies that at least two moves join two identical cells in traversing horizontally back and forth. - Consequently, demonstrating that it is impossible to reach the final required destination without duplicity of movement.

Also, the point ( C_0 ) must be an interior point of side ( AB ), ( A_0 ) must be an interior point of side ( BC ), and ( B_0 ) must be an interior point of side ( CA ). We then aim to find the triangle ( triangle ABC ) with the largest possible area among all such triangles. Step-by-Step Construction: 1. **Construct Angle Arcs:** - For the given triangle ( triangle A_0B_0C_0 ), construct an arc over side ( A_0B_0 ) such that it subtends an angle (gamma) at all points on the arc. This arc is denoted by ( i_c ). - Similarly, construct an arc over side ( B_0C_0 ) that subtends an angle (alpha). This arc is denoted by ( i_a ). 2. **Draw Line through ( B_0 ):** - Through ( B_0 ), draw a line that intersects both arcs ( i_c ) and ( i_a ) at points ( C ) and ( A ) respectively. This ensures that the vertices ( A ) and ( C ) form angles (alpha) and (gamma) with their corresponding sides. 3. **Find Intersection Point ( B ):** - Identify the intersection of line segments ( CA_0 ) and ( AC_0 ) to locate point ( B ). 4. **Ensure Similarity and Internal Points:** - Ensure that ( triangle ABC ) is similar to ( triangle A'B'C' ) by verifying the angles ( angle BAC = alpha, angle ABC = beta, angle BCA = gamma ). 5. **Special Case with Largest Area:** - To maximize the area of ( triangle ABC ), note that among the similar triangles, the one with the longest side ( CA ) will have the largest area. - Consider the complete circle ( k_a ) passing through ( A_0 ) and the complete circle ( k_c ) passing through ( C_0 ). We maximize the area by selecting points ( C ) and ( A ) such that ( M ), where ( k_a ) and ( k_c ) intersect, is as far as possible on the chosen arcs ( i_a ) and ( i_c ).

Since tan 45° = 1, and the tangent function increases in the interval (0°, 90°), we can infer frac{1}{2}tan 46° > frac{1}{2}tan 45° = frac{1}{2}. **For b:** Given, b = 2sin 13°cos 13°.

So, the total percentage of his income distributed to his family is 60% (children) + 30% (wife) = 90%. Now, let's calculate the actual amounts given to the children and the wife from the total income of 800,000. Amount given to children = 60% of 800,000 = 0.60 * 800,000 = 480,000. Amount deposited to wife's account = 30% of 800,000 = 0.30 * 800,000 = 240,000. The total amount distributed to the family is 480,000 (children) + 240,000 (wife) = 720,000.

This configuration provides two black edges for one face and one black edge each for two adjacent faces. - Continue this strategy for adjacent faces ensuring each face reaches the requirement of two black edges. This may necessitate some overlap in edge coloring. 5. **Calculation for Minimum Edges**: - Two black edges can potentially satisfy up to three faces (the two faces they belong to primarily plus one adjacent face that shares one of these edges). - To cover all faces, additional edges may be required strategically placed. - At minimum, using this method, we can place six black edges, such that each set of adjacent edges (e.g., the edge set of top face and bottom face) shares black edges efficiently. 6. **Verification and Conclusion**: - Check if all faces have at least two black edges with the chosen six edges. - No face should be left with fewer than two black edges due to the selected placement strategy. 6 The final answer is boxed{C}"},{"prompt":"The standard equation of the parabola with the axis of symmetry y=1 is ( ).

Since each voucher is worth 50 yuan and costs 25 yuan, the effective saving per voucher is 25 yuan. The total amount of 145 yuan is less than 150 yuan (the value of 3 vouchers), so they can use at most two vouchers without exceeding the total amount to be paid. The savings from using two vouchers are: [2 times 25 = 50 text{ yuan}] Therefore, the maximum amount they can save by using vouchers is boxed{50 text{ yuan}}. Part 2: Actual Payment After On-site Discount Let's denote the total amount Xiao Ming's family needs to pay as x yuan. The hotpot base costs 50 yuan, and the remaining amount, x - 50, is for other dishes which are subject to a 40% discount. Given that Xiao Ming chooses the on-site discount option and saves 15 yuan more than using vouchers, we analyze the situation based on the total amount before applying any discount. 1. **When 50leqslant x < 100:** The calculation for savings would be: [x - 25 - left[50 + (x - 50) times 0.6right] = 15] However, solving this does not yield a valid solution within the given range, so we discard this case. 2. **When 100leqslant x < 150:** The calculation for savings would be: [x - 50 - left[50 + (x - 50) times 0.6right] = 15] Again, solving this does not yield a valid solution within the given range, so we discard this case as well. 3. **When xgeqslant 150:** The calculation for savings would be: [x - 75 - left[50 + (x - 50) times 0.6right] = 15] Solving this equation, we find that x = 275 yuan is the total amount before applying any discount or voucher.

Therefore, ( f(1) > 1 ). - Since ( f(1) ) must divide ( n ), the least prime divisor of ( n ) in any cool pair ( (m, n) ) is bounded. 3. **Bounding the Least Prime Divisor**: - Since ( 1 in text{divs}(n) ), there must be a divisor ( d ) of ( m ) such that ( f(d) = 1 ). - There are finitely many solutions in the positive integers to ( f(d) = 1 ), and ( 1 ) is not one of them. Therefore, the least prime divisor of any ( m ) in a cool pair ( (m, n) ) is also bounded. 4. **Considering Large ( m )**: - For ( m ) large enough, the largest value in ( f(text{divs}(m)) ) should be ( f(m) ), and the second-largest should be ( f(m/p) ), where ( p ) is the least prime divisor of ( m ). - For a good pair ( (m, n) ), we should have ( f(m) = n ) and ( f(m/p) = n/q ), where ( q ) is the least prime divisor of ( n ). 5. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle**: - Since ( p ) and ( q ) are bounded, if there are infinitely many cool pairs ( (m, n) ), by the pigeonhole principle, there should be some pair of primes ( (p, q) ) that occurs infinitely often. - This implies that there are infinitely many ( m ) with ( fleft(frac{m}{p}right) = frac{f(m)}{q} ). 6. **Polynomial Equality**: - The equation ( fleft(frac{m}{p}right) = frac{f(m)}{q} ) must be a polynomial equality. - If there is an ( x^k ) term in ( f ) with a nonzero coefficient, it gets multiplied by ( p^{-k} ) on the LHS and ( q^{-1} ) on the RHS, implying that ( k ) must be unique. - Therefore, ( f(x) = cx^d ) is the only polynomial we must consider, where ( c > 1 ). 7. **Checking for Integer Solutions**: - Such polynomials ( f(x) = cx^d ) will not have any integer solutions to ( f(x) = 1 ) by taking modulo ( c ), which is necessary for any pair ( (m, n) ) to be cool.

So, we have: - Clothing: ( 0.60T ) - Food: ( FT ) - Other items: ( 0.30T ) The total tax paid is 4.8% of the total amount spent, excluding taxes, which is ( 0.048T ). The tax paid on clothing is 4% of the amount spent on clothing, which is ( 0.04 times 0.60T = 0.024T ). The tax paid on other items is 8% of the amount spent on other items, which is ( 0.08 times 0.30T = 0.024T ). Since there is no tax on food, the total tax paid is the sum of the taxes on clothing and other items: [ 0.024T + 0.024T = 0.048T ] This confirms that the total tax paid is indeed 4.8% of the total amount spent, as given in the problem. Now, since we know the percentages spent on clothing and other items, we can find the percentage spent on food by subtracting these from 100%: [ F = 100% - 60% - 30% ] [ F = 10% ] Therefore, Jill spent boxed{10%} of her shopping trip amount on food."},{"prompt":"Consider the function [ g(x) = frac{1}{2 + frac{1}{2 + frac{1}{x}}}. ] Find the sum of all real numbers (x) that are not in the domain of (g(x)).","completion":"The function (g(x)) has denominators (x), (2 + frac{1}{x}), and (2 + frac{1}{2 + frac{1}{x}}).

How much does he have to pay in a year.","completion":"Tom decides to lease a car and has a specific driving pattern each week, which affects the total cost he has to pay annually for the lease. Let's break down the costs step by step. 1. **Calculating the number of long drive days**: Tom drives longer distances on 3 days of the week (Saturday, Sunday, and one more day). This can be calculated as the total days in a week minus the days he drives shorter distances: [7 - 4 = 3] So, he does the long drive for 3 days a week. 2. **Calculating weekly mileage**: On 4 days, he drives 50 miles, and on the remaining 3 days, he drives 100 miles. The total weekly mileage can be calculated as: [4 times 50 + 3 times 100 = 200 + 300 = 500] Thus, he drives a total of 500 miles a week. 3. **Calculating the cost for mileage per week**: The cost per mile is 0.1, so the weekly cost for mileage is: [500 times 0.1 = 50] Therefore, just for the mileage, he pays 50 per week. 4. **Calculating the total weekly payment**: Besides the mileage, he also has to pay a weekly fee of 100. The total weekly payment is: [100 + 50 = 150] So, he pays 150 per week for the car. 5. **Calculating the annual cost**: To find out how much he has to pay in a year, we multiply the weekly cost by the number of weeks in a year: [150 times 52 = 7800] Therefore, the total cost of the car lease for a year is boxed{7800}."},{"prompt":"The coefficient of x^2y^4 in the expansion of (xy)(x+y)^5 is ( ). A: 10 B: 5 C: 5 D: 10","completion":"To find the coefficient of x^2y^4 in the expansion of (x-y)(x+y)^5, we need to use the binomial theorem. The general term formula for the expansion of (x+y)^5 is: T_{r+1}= C_{5}^{r}cdot x^{5-r}cdot y^r, where r represents the r-th term and C_{5}^{r} represents the binomial coefficient. We want the x term to be squared, which means we need to find the terms in the expansion where the power of x is 2, or equivalently where the power of y is 4, since 5-r = 2 Rightarrow r = 3. However, since we are interested in the coefficient of x^2y^4, we also need to take into account the multiplicative factor of (x-y). Here are the two relevant terms after the expansion is started: - From (x+y)^5, we get the term with r = 3: C_{5}^{3}cdot x^{5-3}cdot y^3 = C_{5}^{3}cdot x^2cdot y^3. - After multiplying by (x-y), to get x^2y^4, we need to multiply this term by y from the -y part: -left(C_{5}^{3}cdot x^2cdot y^3right)cdot y = -C_{5}^{3}cdot x^2cdot y^4. - The binomial coefficient C_{5}^{3} equals frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = 10. Putting it all together, the coefficient is -10 times the binomial coefficient: boxed{-10 times C_{5}^{3} = -10 times 10 = -100}. However, we've made a mistake. In the expansion of (x+y)^5, and after multiplying by (x-y), there is actually no term that directly gives us x^2y^4. We need to correct this oversight. In order to have the term x^2y^4, we would need a term of x^2y^3 in the expansion of (x+y)^5 that is multiplied by -y due to (x-y) and a term of x^3y^4 that is multiplied by x. But (x+y)^5 can't give us an x^3y^4 term because that would require r=4 and that would lead to a term x^{5-4}y^4 = xy^4, which is not what we need. Therefore, we must recalculate the coefficient of x^2y^4 correctly by evaluating the term with r=4: - From (x+y)^5, we obtain the term with r = 4: C_{5}^{4}cdot x^{5-4}cdot y^4 = C_{5}^{4}cdot xcdot y^4. - After multiplying by (x-y), to obtain x^2y^4, we multiply this term by x: C_{5}^{4}cdot xcdot y^4cdot x = C_{5}^{4}cdot x^2cdot y^4. - The binomial coefficient C_{5}^{4} equals frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = 5. So, the corrected coefficient for the term x^2y^4 in the expansion of (x-y)(x+y)^5 is: boxed{5 times C_{5}^{4} = 5 times 5 = 25}. We now realize that we only took account of the term obtained by multiplying the term with x from (x-y), but we have ignored the term obtained by multiplying with -y. The complete expression after accounting for both the x and -y components would give us: 1. From the term C_{5}^{3}cdot x^2cdot y^3 (with r=3), we get the term with x^2y^4 by multiplying it by -y from (x-y), giving us a coefficient of -C_{5}^{3}cdot y. 2. Since no term from the expansion of (x+y)^5 can be multiplied by x from (x-y) to produce x^2y^4, we only have the coefficient from the term multiplied by -y. Recalculating: - The coefficient for the term x^2y^4 is C_{5}^{3} which is 10. - Multiplying by the -y component, we obtain -10 as the coefficient for x^2y^4. Thus, the correct coefficient for the term x^2y^4 in the expansion of (x-y)(x+y)^5 is: boxed{-10 times C_{5}^{3} = -10 times 10 = -100}.

Since we're given that the common difference d < -1, this implies that as n increases, S_n will eventually decrease and can become negative by adding more negative terms.

How can you guarantee that the camera will turn on with 10 such attempts?","completion":"\`\`\`markdown 1. **Numbering the Batteries:** Label the batteries from 1 to 22. 2. **Initial Trials:** Perform the first six trials using the following sets of batteries: - Try batteries 1, 2, 3. - Try batteries 4, 5, 6. - Try batteries 7, 8, 9. - Try batteries 10, 11, 12. - Try batteries 13, 14, 15. - Try batteries 16, 17, 18. Each trial involves three batteries, and there are a total of six such trials. 3. **Analysis of Results:** After conducting the six trials, consider the outcomes: - If the camera starts functioning with any of the sets of batteries, we have found at least one set of three charged batteries, and the solution is complete. - If none of the first six trials work, it indicates that among the first 18 batteries, there must be at least 6 discharged batteries. This conclusion follows because with fewer than 6 discharged batteries, it would be impossible to avoid having at least one set of three working (charged) batteries. 4. **Remaining Batteries:** Since the first 18 batteries failed to start the camera, we now know that at least 15 of them are possibly either discharged or not in the right combination to start the camera. Focus on the remaining batteries: - This leaves the batteries numbered 19, 20, 21, and 22. - Since the total number of discharged batteries is 7, and we have potentially accounted for 6 of these in the previous 18 batteries, it implies that out of batteries 19, 20, 21, and 22, there can be at most 1 discharged battery. 5. **Ensuring a Working Combination:** Perform trials using all possible combinations of three batteries from the last four remaining batteries: - Try batteries 19, 20, 21. - Try batteries 19, 20, 22. - Try batteries 19, 21, 22. - Try batteries 20, 21, 22. Since there can be at most one discharged battery among these four, one of these sets must contain only charged batteries, ensuring that the camera will start. # Conclusion To guarantee the camera turns on in no more than 10 trials, you can verify the batteries using the aforementioned method. The strategy focuses on covering all possibilities to ensure at least one successful combination. boxed{} \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"Let prod_{k=1}^{n} a_{k}=a_{1} a_{2} cdots a_{n}, f_{n}(x)=x^{frac{n}{3}}, g_{n}(x)=x^{frac{n}{5}}, h_{n}(x)=x^{frac{n}{2}}, where n and k are positive integers.

Let ( f ) be a function satisfying the given functional equation.

In particular, we have: [ g(0) = 2C ] **Step 2:** Rewrite the original functional equation. Now, the original functional equation: [ f(f(m) + n) + f(m) - f(n) + f(3m) + 2014 = 0 ] can be rewritten using ( g(m) ) as: [ f(f(m) + n) = g(m) - f(n) ] for all ( m, n in mathbb{Z} ). **Step 3:** Apply induction. By induction in both directions, we deduce: [ f(tf(m) + n) = tg(m) + f(n) ] for all ( m, n, t in mathbb{Z} ). **Step 4:** Analyze specific cases and solutions. Applying this result to specific triples such as ( (r, 0, f(0)) ) and ( (0, 0, f(r)) ), we obtain: [ f(0)g(r) = f(f(r)f(0)) - f(0) = f(r)g(0) ] **Step 5:** Determine the nature of ( f ). If ( f(0) = 0 ), then ( g(0) = 2C ) implies that ( f ) vanishes identically, contradicting the original equation. Thus, ( f(0) neq 0 ) and we find: [ g(r) = alpha f(r) ] where ( alpha = frac{g(0)}{f(0)} ) is a nonzero constant. **Step 6:** Define and solve for ( beta ). Using the definition of ( g ), we get: [ f(3m) - beta = (1 + alpha)(f(m) - beta) ] where ( beta = frac{2C}{alpha} ). **Step 7:** Generalize using induction. By induction on ( k ), it follows that: [ f(3^k m) - beta = (1 + alpha)^k(f(m) - beta) ] for all integers ( k geq 0 ) and ( m ). **Step 8:** Analyze the conditions with ( d ). Since ( 3 nmid 2014 ), there exists some value ( d = f(a) ) that is not divisible by 3.

Since a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 + a_7 represents 5 consecutive terms in the sequence, we can rewrite it as 5a_5 = 25. Solving for a_5, we get a_5 = 5. Now, we are asked to find the sum of the first 9 terms, S_9. Using the sum formula again, we have S_9 = frac{9}{2}(a_1 + a_9). Since {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, a_9 is 4 terms after a_5, so a_9 = a_5 + 4d = 5 + 4d. However, we don't have enough information to find the common difference d. But notice that S_9 can also be written as the sum of two parts: the sum of the first 5 terms and the sum of the next 4 terms. That is, S_9 = S_5 + (a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9). Since a_5 is the middle term of the first 5 terms, S_5 = 5a_5 = 25. Similarly, a_7 is the middle term of the next 4 terms, so a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 4a_7 = 4(a_5 + 2d) = 4(5 + 2d) = 20 + 8d. Again, we don't have enough information to find d, but we can express S_9 in terms of a_5: S_9 = S_5 + (a_6 + a_7 + a_8 + a_9) = 5a_5 + 4a_7 = 5(5) + 4(5 + 2d) = 25 + 20 + 8d = 45 + 8d.

Let g(x) = e_nx^n + cdots + e_1x + e_0. Thus, the term yielding the highest power in f(g(x)) is a(e_nx^n)^3 = ae_n^3x^{3n}. Since h(x) = f(g(x)) + x^5, to find the degree of h(x) (which is 10), the maximum degree term must either be ae_n^3x^{3n} or x^5. For h(x) to be a degree 10 polynomial, and considering x^5 is of degree 5, 3n must be equal to 10 (since that's the only way the degree of f(g(x)) would contribute to the polynomial degree exceeding 5).

Determine the average time in minutes the bus spends stopped per hour, considering the entire journey consisted of both highspeed and lowspeed segments, as well as stops of different durations.","completion":"To determine the average time the bus spends stopped per hour, we need to compare the average speed when the bus is in motion to the overall average speed including stoppages. When the bus is in motion, it travels at an average speed of 75 km/hr. However, when we consider the overall journey, including stoppages, the average speed drops to 40 km/hr. This means that the bus is not moving for a certain amount of time, which causes the overall average speed to decrease. Let's calculate the ratio of the overall average speed to the speed when in motion: Ratio = Overall average speed / Speed when in motion Ratio = 40 km/hr / 75 km/hr Ratio = 4 / 7.5 Ratio = 0.5333 (approximately) This ratio tells us that for every hour of travel, the bus is effectively moving for 0.5333 hours (or 53.33% of the time) at the speed of 75 km/hr, and it is stopped for the remaining time. To find the time stopped, we subtract the effective moving time from the total time: Time stopped per hour = Total time - Effective moving time Time stopped per hour = 1 hour - 0.5333 hours Time stopped per hour = 0.4667 hours To convert this time into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Time stopped per hour in minutes = 0.4667 hours * 60 minutes/hour Time stopped per hour in minutes = 28 minutes (approximately) Therefore, the bus spends an average of boxed{28} minutes stopped per hour during the journey."},{"prompt":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, the sum of the first n terms is S_n.

For each pair, if one of the rerolled dice matches, it creates a three-of-a-kind. Each die that is rerolled has 2 chances (match either pair) out of 6 to match a specific pair, so the probability that at least one matches any pair in one roll is frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3}. The probability that neither die matches a pair is (1 - frac{1}{3})^2 = frac{4}{9}. Therefore, the probability at least one matches is 1 - frac{4}{9} = frac{5}{9}. Case 2: Both rerolled dice come up as a new third pair (without matching the existing pairs), can occur in binom{4}{1} times frac{1}{36} = frac{4}{36} = frac{1}{9} ways, as there are 4 remaining numbers and each needs to be picked twice.

Hence, we need to find three 3-digit numbers such that their product is divisible by both 2^4 = 16 and 5^4 = 625. 3. **Divisibility Considerations:** - To be divisible by 2^4, the product must contain at least four factors of 2. - To be divisible by 5^4, the product must contain at least four factors of 5. 4. **Finding Suitable Digits and Numbers:** We choose three numbers: 125, 360, and 748, and ensure they use distinct digits and all digits combine across the three numbers.

This involves distributing the increments in such a way that ( B ) cannot reduce the sum of any block of 10 consecutive numbers to zero before at least one number reaches ( k ). 3. **Proof that ( A ) cannot have any bucket with ( geq 1 + frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} + cdots + frac{1}{7} )**: - Let ( A ) be Alex and ( B ) be Bethany. - Define a (mathbf{block}) as any group of at most ten consecutive buckets. - Call two blocks disjoint if they do not share any common buckets. - Let ( S_i = 1 + frac{1}{7} + cdots + frac{1}{i} ) for ( 1 leq i leq 7 ), and let ( S_8 = 1 ). 4. **Key Lemma**: Any ( i ) pairwise disjoint blocks must have a sum of strictly less than ( iS_i ) in total at any point in time. - **Proof by Downwards Induction on ( i )**: - **Base Case ( i = 8 )**: Notice that Bethany always reduces the sum to at most ( frac{7}{8} ) of what it was before Bethany's move. Hence, the sum of all 80 buckets can never be ( geq 8 ) by an easy induction. - **Inductive Step**: Suppose the result holds for ( i = k ), some ( k > 1 ). When ( i = k-1 ), we will show that any ( k-1 ) disjoint blocks have sum ( < (k-1)S_{k-1} ). - Assume, for contradiction, that some ( k-1 ) disjoint blocks ( B_1, B_2, cdots, B_{k-1} ) had a sum of at least ( (k-1)S_{k-1} ). - Clearly, we can assume WLOG that Alex has just moved, as then he can strictly increase the sum of the numbers of the ( B_i )'s. Call this point in time ( t = 0 ). 5. **Travel Back in Time**: - Undo Alex's last move. Let this point in time be ( t = -1 ). - Since Bethany moved before this, there must exist 10 consecutive zeros somewhere in the circle (the 10 consecutive numbers that she cleared). Call the block consisting of these 10 consecutive zeros ( D ). - Notice that the sum of the numbers in ( B_1, B_2, cdots, B_{k-1} ) is now at least ( (k-1) S_{k-1} - 1 = (k-1)S_k ). - If any ( B_i ) is not disjoint with ( D ), then remove ( B_i cap D ) from ( B_i ) to create the new block ( C_i ). Otherwise, simply let ( C_i = B_i ). - Notice that since ( B_i ) has length at most 10, ( C_i ) must still be a contiguous block after this operation, and clearly also has at most 10 buckets within it. Furthermore, since we only removed zeros, the sum of the numbers in the ( C_i ) is the same as the numbers in the ( B_i ), which is ( geq (k-1)S_k ). 6. **Further Back in Time**: - Undo Bethany's move before that. We are now in time ( t = -2 ). - Since she selected the block ( D ) with the largest sum, we know that at ( t = -2 ), the block ( D ) had a sum which was at least as great as all of the ( C_i )'s, and in particular it must have a sum which is at least ( frac{C_1 + C_2 + cdots + C_{k-1}}{k-1} geq S_k ). - Therefore, we know that at time ( t = -2 ), the sum of the pairwise disjoint blocks ( D, C_1, C_2, cdots, C_{k-1} ) is at least ( S_k + (k-1)S_k = kS_k ), which clearly is a contradiction to our induction hypothesis. 7. **Conclusion**: - As we've derived a contradiction, we know that the sum of any ( k-1 ) disjoint blocks is always ( < (k-1)S_{k-1} ) at any point in time, and so the induction is complete. (blacksquare) 8. **Final Step**: - The problem now follows by taking ( i=1 ) in the lemma above, and noting that a single bucket is a block.

Each of them had a locker totaling 1000 lockers, numbered from 1 to 1000. Furthermore, there were exactly 1000 ghosts in this school. Every student locked their locker upon leaving the school, but at night the ghosts would play with the lockers, either unlocking or locking them. One evening, the students left all the lockers locked as usual. Exactly at midnight, the ghosts appeared. First, the first ghost unlocked all the lockers; then, the second ghost locked the lockers whose numbers were divisible by 2; then, the third ghost changed the state (i.e., unlocked it if it was locked and locked it if it was unlocked) of the lockers whose numbers were divisible by 3; the fourth ghost changed the state of the lockers whose numbers were divisible by 4, and so on. After the thousandth ghost changed the state of the thousandth locker, a rooster crowed, and all the ghosts quickly vanished. Can you tell how many lockers remain open after the ghosts' visit?","completion":"1. **Identify the behavior of the lockers**: Each time a ghost interacts with a locker, it toggles the locker's state (locked to unlocked or unlocked to locked). The interaction of each ghost depends on the divisors of the locker's number. For a locker number ( C ): - First ghost toggles all lockers. - Second ghost toggles every second locker. - Third ghost toggles every third locker. - This continues until the thousandth ghost toggles the thousandth locker. 2. **Determine the number of times a locker is toggled**: A locker number ( C ) will be toggled once for every divisor it has. For example, locker 12 is toggled by ghosts corresponding to the divisors of 12, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. 3. **Parity of divisors**: If the total number of divisors of a number is even, the locker will end up locked. If it's odd, the locker will end up unlocked. 4. **Perfect squares**: The total number of divisors is odd only if the number is a perfect square. This is because divisors usually come in pairs, except in the case of perfect squares where one of the divisors is repeated (e.g., for 36, divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36. Here, 6 is repeated, resulting in an odd count of divisors). 5. **Count perfect squares up to 1000**: The perfect squares between 1 and 1000 are: [ 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, ldots, 31^2 quad (text{because } 32^2 = 1024 text{ which is greater than 1000}). ] Hence, the perfect squares from 1 to 31. 6. **Result**: Therefore, 31 lockers will be open at the end of all the toggling.

For example, the string AAABBBCC represents breaking all three targets in column A, then all three in column B, and finally the two in column C. 3. **Calculate the Number of Different Orders**: The problem of finding the number of different orders in which the targets can be broken is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange the letters in our string.

Each square is either black or white and the colors alternate. 5. **Tracking Checker Movement:** - If a checker starts on a black square, after one jump (which is equivalent to moving over an adjacent checker), it lands on a white square. - Correspondingly, a checker starting on a white square ends up on a black square after a jump. - This alternates every move: Black to White, White to Black, etc. 6. **Initial Distribution Analysis:** Since each quarter is a 5 times 5, each lower left and upper right quarter contain a balanced distribution of black and white squares. - There are an equal number of black and white squares in any 5 times 5 segment of the grid. 7. **Checker Count on Specific Squares:** Initially: - 25 checkers in Quadrant 3: 12 or 13 on black, remaining on white (without loss of generality, let's assume 12 on black, for an even count). - 25 checkers in Quadrant 2: 12 or 13 on black, rest on white. 8. **Parity Argument:** Let's count the parity (evenness or oddness) regarding color change: - Suppose initially, we want all 50 checkers on the left half of the board (Quadrants 1 and 3). - After moving checkers from Quadrant 2 to Quadrant 1, the parity of black and white squares among moved checkers maintains it as alternating. 9. **Impossibility Argument:** Since each correct jump switches a checker's square color, reaching the left half from right upper quadrant in entirety would need an imbalance in initially balanced alternating paving, which is impossible to achieve through even steps (as results perform alternate). 10. **Conclusion:** The attempt to move all checkers from specified quadrants while maintaining alternate color landings leads to an inherently impossible distribution pattern after several back and forth-based jumps.

This is akin to trying to lift oneself out of a pit by pulling one's own hair or suspending the foundation of a house from the first floor when the first floor itself depends on the foundation. 3. **Example Involving Geometry:** - Consider proving that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle equals two right angles (180 degrees). - Suppose someone uses the formula for the sum of internal angles of an ( n )-sided polygon, given as ( S_n = 2 times (n-2) ) right angles. - For ( n = 3 ), a triangle, we get ( S_3 = 2 times (3-2) = 2 ) right angles, which is ( 180^circ ). 4. **Identifying the Error:** - This formula for the sum of the angles of an ( n )-sided polygon is actually based on the theorem that states the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. - Therefore, using this formula to prove the sum of angles in a triangle results in a \\"vicious circle\\" because the formula presupposes the very theorem it aims to prove. 5. **Circular Reasoning:** - The use of this formula, which inherently assumes the correctness of the geometric property of triangles (the sum of the internal angles is 180 degrees), leads to circular reasoning. This dependency illustrates a classic example of the fallacy \\"circulus vitiosus\\". 6. **Conclusion:** - Thus, the logical mistake of \\"circulus vitiosus\\" is evident when one fails to recognize that the proof depends on the assumption of the theorem's validity.

Then the expression we are considering is: |E(x)| + |x + 6| + |x - 5| According to the information provided, the minimum value of this entire expression is 11. This means that the smallest possible value that the sum of the absolute values can take is 11. Since we are looking for the minimum value of |E(x)| given that the minimum of the whole expression is 11, we need to consider the minimum values of the other two absolute value expressions, |x + 6| and |x - 5|. The absolute value function |x| achieves its minimum value of 0 when x = 0. Therefore, |x + 6| achieves its minimum value when x = -6, and |x - 5| achieves its minimum value when x = 5. However, x cannot be both -6 and 5 at the same time. So, we need to find a value of x that minimizes the sum of |x + 6| and |x - 5|. The point that is equidistant from -6 and 5 on the number line is the midpoint between them, which is (-6 + 5)/2 = -0.5. At x = -0.5, both |x + 6| and |x - 5| will be at their respective minimum values without being zero.

Step 1: Understand the properties of (pi_1) and (pi_2). - A partition (pi) of a set divides the set into non-overlapping subsets (called parts) such that their union gives the original set. - For each element (h), (pi(h)) denotes the number of elements in the part containing (h). Step 2: Determine the possible configurations of (pi_1). Given that the total number of elements in (X) is (9), let us consider the possible sizes of the parts in the partition (pi_1). 1. Suppose (pi_1) has parts of sizes (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m) such that: [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_m = 9 ] 2. Since each part must consist of at least one element, and (X) has 9 elements, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one part of size greater than 1. We now show that there must be at least 4 elements with the same value of (pi_1(x)). Step 3: Prove that at least 4 elements must share the same (pi_1) value. - Assume for the sake of contradiction that no more than 3 elements share the same value of (pi_1(x)), i.e., all parts have sizes 1, 2, or 3. This would imply: [ a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m leq 3 ] 3. Let's enumerate the possibilities: - If there are parts of size 3, then at most one such part can exist, otherwise, we would exceed 9 elements. - Similarly, at most one part can be of size 2. 4. The possible combinations are: - One part of size 3, one part of size 2, and remaining parts of size 1. However, summation (i.e., (3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1)) would give 8 elements, not 9, leading to a contradiction. Thus, at least 4 elements must have the same part size in (pi_1). Step 4: Analyze distinct part sizes in (pi_2). - Consider the 4 elements identified in (pi_1). Let’s examine their part sizes in (pi_2): Given that 9 elements cannot be partitioned into parts where each part has a unique size greater than 9 (since a minimum size of parts is at least 1 and up to 9 being the number of elements in the set), by the pigeonhole principle, among these 4 elements, there must be at least two elements (h) and (k) such that (pi_2(h) = pi_2(k)).

This configuration means that we can eventually slide a domino into the empty space. 3. **Boundary conditions:** - An empty cell cannot be on the boundary of the rectangle since one of the neighboring dominoes can be slid. - On examining cells, if there is a group of adjacent empty cells, the domino covering the top or bottom of the rectangle should be movable, thus contradicting. 4. **Applying to small grids:** - In any 2 times 2 square within the rectangle, there can't be more than one empty cell. - If two empty cells stood diagonally, two remaining cells in the 2 times 2 square must be occupied by dominoes.

We can then find the maximum possible temperature for the remaining day by subtracting this sum from the total sum of temperatures: 250 (total sum) - 180 (sum of four days at 45) = 70. So the highest possible temperature for the remaining day is 70. The range of a set of numbers is the difference between the highest and lowest numbers. In this case, the maximum range of temperatures would be: 70 (highest possible temperature) - 45 (lowest temperature) = 25.

Show that if ∠PSR = ∠SPQ, then PR = QS.","completion":"Given the quadrilateral (ABCD), we need to show that (PR = QS) provided (angle PSR = angle SPQ). 1. Define the given points precisely: - Let (P) be the foot of the perpendicular from (D) to (AB), implying (DP perp AB). - Let (Q) be the foot of the perpendicular from (D) to (BC), implying (DQ perp BC). - Let (R) be the foot of the perpendicular from (B) to (AD), implying (BR perp AD). - Let (S) be the foot of the perpendicular from (B) to (CD), implying (BS perp CD). 2. We note that these perpendiculars imply specific geometric properties. Importantly, points (P), (Q), (R), and (S) are special because they form right angles with the sides of (ABCD). 3. To proceed, understand that (P, Q, R,) and (S) must lie on a circle. This is because: - A circle can be inscribed touching the legs of these right triangles formed by the perpendiculars. - Specifically, this can be described as the circle whose diameter is (BD), since (BP), (BQ), (DP), and (DQ) are perpendicular to the sides. 4. Given that (angle PSR = angle SPQ), we recognize that these angles subtended at the circumference of the circle by the arcs (PR) and (QS) must be equal. 5. By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, if angles subtended by chords in a circle are equal (i.e., (angle PSR = angle SPQ)), then the chords themselves must be of equal length. This theorem states that the inscribed angles subtending the same arc or equal arcs are equal. 6. As a result, from (angle PSR = angle SPQ), it follows that the lengths of the chords (PR) and (QS) are equal: [ PR = QS ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{PR = QS} ]"},{"prompt":"Let p and q be the solutions of the equation 3x^2 + 9x 21 = 0.

Since the base of a is greater than 1, and the exponent is positive, it's clear that a > 1 because 6^{0.7} > 6^0 = 1. 2. As for b, since 0 < 0.7 < 1 and raising a fraction between 0 and 1 to a positive power makes the result even smaller, we know that 0 < b = 0.7^6 < 0.7. 3. Lastly, considering c, we need to understand how logarithms behave. In this case, c = log_{0.7} 6 represents the exponent you need to raise 0.7 to in order to get 6. But because 0.7 is less than 1, and raising it to any real power gives a number less than 1, while 6 is greater than 1, we know the logarithm will be negative. In other words, c < log_{0.7} 1 = 0, because log_{0.7} 1 equals 0 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1). Bringing all this together, we can determine that c < b < a since we have c < 0, 0 < b < 0.7, and a > 1.

An odd sum (53) from two primes suggests that one of the primes has to be 2, since combining two odd primes results in an even sum. 2. **Subtract the Even Prime**: - Assume one of the primes is 2; subtract it from 53, so the second prime must be 53 - 2 = 51. 3. **Check if 51 is a Prime**: - The number 51 factors into 3 times 17, therefore, it is not a prime. 4. **Running check for other possible primes under 53**: - Repeat with all primes lower than 53: 3, 5, 7, ..., 47. - For each prime p_i < 53, check if 53 - p_i is prime. - The pairs that work: 2 + 51, 5 + 48, 17 + 36, and 23 + 30, but only two and 51 gives valid primes (53 = 2 + 51). 5. **Result Consistency**: - Therefore, there is only 1 valid prime-to-prime sum that equals 53: (2, 51).

Prakash's work rate is 1/75 (since he can finish the work in 75 days), which means he can complete 1/75th of the work in one day. When they work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: Combined work rate = Ravi's work rate + Prakash's work rate Combined work rate = 1/50 + 1/75 To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

From f(x)=ln x+ frac {a}{x}, we get f'(x)= frac {1}{x}- frac {a}{x^{2}}= frac {x-a}{x^{2}}. Since a > 0, when xin(0,a), f'(x) < 0; when xin(a,+infty), f'(x) > 0. Thus, the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,a) and monotonically increasing on (a,+infty). When x=a, min[f(x)]=ln a+1. When ln a+1leqslant 0, i.e., 0 < aleqslant frac {1}{e}, and f(1)=ln 1+a=a > 0, then the function f(x) has a root. Therefore, the range of the real number a is boxed{(0, frac {1}{e}]}. Method 2: The domain of the function f(x)=ln x+ frac {a}{x} is (0,+infty). From f(x)=ln x+ frac {a}{x}=0, we get a=-xln x. Let g(x)=-xln x, then g'(x)=-(ln x+1). When xin(0, frac {1}{e}), g'(x) > 0; when xin( frac {1}{e},+infty), g'(x) < 0. Thus, the function g(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, frac {1}{e}) and monotonically decreasing on ( frac {1}{e},+infty). Therefore, when x= frac {1}{e}, the function g(x) reaches its maximum value g( frac {1}{e})=- frac {1}{e}ln frac {1}{e}= frac {1}{e}. Hence, for the function f(x)=ln x+ frac {a}{x} to have a root, 0 < aleqslant frac {1}{e}. Therefore, the range of the real number a is boxed{(0, frac {1}{e}]}. (II) Proof: Let h(x)=xln x+a, then h'(x)=ln x+1. When 0 < x < frac {1}{e}, h'(x) < 0; when x > frac {1}{e}, h'(x) > 0. Thus, the function h(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, frac {1}{e}) and monotonically increasing on ( frac {1}{e},+infty). When x= frac {1}{e}, min[h(x)]=- frac {1}{e}+a. Thus, when ageqslant frac {2}{e}, h(x)geqslant - frac {1}{e}+ageqslant frac {1}{e}. Let varphi(x)=xe^{-x}, then varphi'(x)=e^{-x}-xe^{-x}=e^{-x}(1-x). When 0 < x < 1, varphi'(x) > 0; when x > 1, varphi'(x) < 0. Thus, the function varphi(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,1) and monotonically decreasing on (1,+infty). When x=1, max[varphi(x)]= frac {1}{e}. Thus, when x > 0, varphi(x)leqslant frac {1}{e}. Clearly, the equalities in the inequalities cannot hold simultaneously. Therefore, when x > 0, ageqslant frac {2}{e}, xln x+a > xe^{-x}. Since b > 1, ln b > 0. Thus, ln bcdotln (ln b)+a > ln bcdot e^{-ln b}.

By projecting nearly centers of symmetry onto a line and examining their coordinates, the problem reduces to the distribution of these points along a straight line. Let ( M ) have ( n ) points with coordinates ( x_1 < x_2 < ldots < x_{n-1} < x_n ). If we remove: - ( x_1 ), then nearly center of symmetry is (left( x_2 + x_n right) / 2) - ( x_n ), then nearly center of symmetry is (left( x_1 + x_{n-1} right) / 2) - Any other point, the nearly center of symmetry is (left( x_1 + x_n right) / 2 ) Hence, ( M ) can have no more than three nearly centers of symmetry since it is constrained by these symmetric ranges.

We need to prove that there exist ( 2k ) integers, and if these integers are divided arbitrarily into two groups, there will always be a subset of these integers such that the sum is divisible by ( n ). 1. **Step 1: Establish ( n ) with an Upper Bound** Since ( n < 2^k ), let's consider ( n = 2^r ) for some positive integer ( r ). Given ( r < k ), let's choose ( 2k ) integers specifically. 2. **Step 2: Collection of Integers** Consider the integers: [ -1, -1, -2, -2^2, ldots, -2^{k-2}, 1, 2, 2^2, ldots, 2^{i-1} ] These integers form a collection of ( 2k ) numbers, which are clearly not divisible by ( n ) since ( pm 2^i ) where ( i < r ) are not divisible by ( 2^r ). 3. **Step 3: Dividing into Two Groups** If we split these ( 2k ) numbers into two groups arbitrarily, we need to ensure that there exists a subset whose sum is divisible by ( n ). 4. **Step 4: Summation and Parity Argument** Whenever we divide ( 2k ) numbers into two groups, at least one of the groups will include sums involving ( 2 ) combined with other summand terms, for example: [ (-1) + (-1) + 2 = 0 mod n ] Which implies that combinations involving addition or subtraction will yield sums divisible by ( n ) if ( -2 ) is in the other group. 5. **Step 5: Contradiction with Binary Representation** Assume ( n ) is not necessarily a power of 2.

Therefore, [ left| sum_{i=1}^{k} a_{t_i} right| leq 2(s-r+1) - (s-r) = s-r + 2 leq 505 + 2 = 506. ] - **Case 2: (sum_{i=1}^{k} a_{t_i} < 0):** By symmetry, if (sum_{i=1}^{k} a_{t_i} < 0), consider the sequence (b_i = -a_i). The same argument as in Case 1 applies, showing that (left| sum_{i=1}^{k} a_{t_i} right| leq 506). 5. **Lower Bound for (C):** To show that (C = 506) works, consider any sequence (a_i). Without loss of generality, assume there are at least as many (+1)'s as (-1)'s. Suppose there are (x) (+1)'s and (2022-x) (-1)'s with (x geq 1011). Let ({c_1, c_2, ldots, c_{2022-x}}) be the indices where (a_i = -1). Construct the subsequence by excluding every second (-1): [ sum_{i=1}^{k} a_{t_i} = x - (2022 - x) - sum a_{c_{2i+1}} geq (2x - 2022) - left(-frac{2022-x}{2}right) = frac{3}{2}x - 1011. ] Since (x geq 1011), [ frac{3}{2} cdot 1011 - 1011 = 505.5. ] Thus, (left| sum_{i=1}^{k} a_{t_i} right| geq 506).

First, let's find A's time over the course of 80 meters. Since A beats B by 7 seconds, we can say that the time it takes B to run 80 meters is the time it takes A to run 80 meters plus 7 seconds. Let ( t_A ) be the time it takes A to run 80 meters, and ( t_B ) be the time it takes B to run 80 meters.

The remaining 25 days are other days (Monday to Saturday), and the total number of visitors on these days will be 25 * V. The average number of visitors per day for the entire month is given as 290, and there are 30 days in the month. Therefore, the total number of visitors for the month is 30 * 290. Now we can set up an equation to solve for V: Total visitors on Sundays + Total visitors on other days = Total visitors for the month (5 * 540) + (25 * V) = 30 * 290 Now we can solve for V: 2700 + 25V = 8700 25V = 8700 - 2700 25V = 6000 V = 6000 / 25 V = 240 So, the library has an average of boxed{240} visitors on other days (Monday to Saturday)."},{"prompt":"Bela and Jenn play a modified game on the closed interval [0, n] of the real number line, where n is a fixed integer greater than 6.
