We know the total cost for the week is 118, so the cost of gas would be the total cost minus the cost of tolls. Cost of gas for the week: 118 - 51.50 = 66.50 Since both the car and the motorcycle get 35 miles per gallon, we can calculate the total number of gallons used for the week. Number of gallons used for the week: 66.50 / 3.75 per gallon = 17.7333 gallons Now, let's calculate the total miles driven for the week. Since Geordie drives to work and back five times a week, the total miles driven for the week would be 10 times the one-way commute distance. Total miles driven for the week: 17.7333 gallons × 35 miles per gallon = 620.6665 miles Since this is the total for 10 commutes (5 days to work and 5 days back), we divide by 10 to find the one-way commute distance.

Determine the number of ways to choose sets of eight distinct vertices from these 24 such that none of the arcs has length 3 or 8 .","completion":"1. **Generalize the Problem**: We start by generalizing the problem where (24) is replaced with (3n), and we wish to find the number of sets of (n) distinct vertices such that no two are (3) or (n) apart. Label the vertices (1, 2, ldots, 3n) and split them into groups of three: (1, n+1, 2n+1) (group 1), (2, n+2, 2n+2) (group 2), and so on until (n, 2n, 3n) (group (n)). 2. **Group Selection**: Since there are (n) groups and (n) vertices we must select, it follows that we are picking one vertex from each group. This deals with the (n) apart condition, so now we only have to focus on the (3) apart condition. 3. **Recurrence Relation**: We will construct a recursion relation to do this. Let (a_n) denote the number of ways to select a set of (n) vertices with the aforementioned properties. First off, we clearly have (a_1=0) because each vertex is three apart from itself. We also have (a_2=6) which can be manually computed. 4. **Counting Valid Sets**: Now consider the number of ways to select this set of (n) vertices: if we pick the first vertex from the first group, the second from the second, and so on, ignoring the condition that (n) and (n+1) cannot both be in the set (and the same for (2n) and (2n+1), (3n) and (3n+1)) there are clearly (3 cdot 2^{n-1}) ways to do this. 5. **Overcounting Adjustment**: However, we have to deal with the fact that (n) and (n+1) can't be in the set at the same time, as mentioned previously. Our figure of (3 cdot 2^{n-1}) overcounts all choices of the first (n-1) vertices selected, except in the case where the same choice of (n-1) vertices is not valid if we delete the (n)th group (leaving us with (3(n-1)) vertices). The number of overcounts is therefore the number of legal sets of (n-1) vertices, so our recursion relation is (a_n = 3 cdot 2^{n-1} - a_{n-1}). 6. **Finding Closed Form**: From (a_{n} = 3 cdot 2^{n-1} - a_{n-1}) we get (a_{n+1} = 3 cdot 2^n - a_n). Subtracting the first from the second and cleaning things up yields: [ a_{n+1} = 3 cdot 2^{n-1} + a_{n-1} ] Now subtracting this equation from the first, we get: [ a_n - a_{n+1} = -2a_{n-1} ] Upon rearranging and shifting this yields: [ a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2} ] 7. **Solving the Recurrence**: The roots of the characteristic polynomial for this are (2) and (-1), so we have: [ a_n = A cdot 2^n + B(-1)^n ] for some constants (A) and (B). Plugging in (a_1 = 0) and (a_2 = 6) gives us (A = 1) and (B = 2), so we have: [ a_n = 2^n + 2(-1)^n ] 8. **Final Calculation**: Thus we have: [ a_8 = 2^8 + 2(-1)^8 = 256 + 2 = boxed{258} ]"},{"prompt":"Calculate the limit of frac{x^3 1}{x 1} as x approaches 1.

We need to show that (varphi(t)) can be the characteristic function of some random variable (X) if and only if (operatorname{deg} P(t) leq 2). 1. **Representation of Characteristic Function**: Given that ( varphi(t) = e^{P(t)} = mathbb{E}[e^{itX}] ) for some random variable (X) and (t in mathbb{R}), we can extend this to complex values: [ e^{P(-iz)} = mathbb{E}[e^{zX}] quad text{for } z in mathbb{C} ] This follows from the analytic extension of the characteristic function. 2. **Moments and Power Series**: The moments of (X) exist if we consider the derivatives of (varphi(t)) at (t = 0): [ 1 + sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{mathbb{E}[X^n]}{n!} z^n ] This power series converges and defines (mathbb{E}[e^{zX}]). 3. **Real-Valued Polynomial**: For ( varphi(t) = e^{P(-iz)} ) to be a real number for (z in mathbb{R}), (P(-iz)) must be a polynomial with real coefficients: [ P(-iz) = sum_{k=1}^{d} a_k (iz)^k ] where (d = operatorname{deg} P) and (a_d neq 0). 4. **Logarithmic Magnitude Inequality**: Consider the inequality using real and imaginary parts: [ operatorname{Re} left( sum_{k=1}^{d} a_k (s + it)^k right) = ln left| mathbb{E}[e^{(s + it)X}] right| leq ln mathbb{E}[|e^{(s + it)X}|] = sum_{k=1}^{d} a_k s^k ] for (s, t in mathbb{R}). This inequality in polar coordinates is rewritten as: [ sum_{k=1}^d a_k r^k cos(ktheta) leq sum_{k=1}^d a_k r^k cos^k(theta) ] where (r geq 0) and (theta in [0, 2pi)). 5. **Asymptotic Analysis**: Dividing by (r^d) and taking the limit as (r to infty), we get: [ a_d cos(dtheta) leq a_d cos^d(theta) ] 6. **Inequality for (cos)**: Consider the expansion of (cos x) near zero: [ a_d left( 1 - frac{d^2 theta^2}{2} right) leq a_d left( 1 - dfrac{theta^2}{2} right) ] This implies (a_d > 0) (if (d > 1)), and we conclude (cos(dtheta) leq cos^d(theta)). For (theta = frac{2pi}{d}), this reduces to: [ 1 leq cos^dleft( frac{2pi}{d} right) ] 7. **Conclusion**: The above inequality, (1 leq cos^d left( frac{2pi}{d} right)), holds only for (d = 1) or (d = 2). Hence, the polynomial (P(t)) can have a degree no more than 2 for (varphi(t) = e^{P(t)}) to be a characteristic function.

Let us consider an isosceles triangle ( triangle ABC ) where ( AB ) is the base, and ( AC = BC ). We will analyze the properties of the angle bisector, ( CM ), which is drawn from the vertex ( C ) to the base ( AB ) at point ( M ). 2. To prove our claim, we start by showing that the triangles ( triangle ACM ) and ( triangle BCM ) are congruent. This can be done using the following congruence criteria: - ( AC = BC ) (by definition of an isosceles triangle), - ( CM ) is common to both triangles (triangle ACM) and (triangle BCM), - Angle ( angle ACM = angle BCM ) because ( CM ) is the angle bisector of (angle ACB). 3. By the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence criterion, we conclude that ( triangle ACM cong triangle BCM ). 4. Since the triangles are congruent, all corresponding elements of the triangles must be equal. Therefore, ( AM = BM ). Hence, ( CM ) bisects ( AB ), demonstrating that ( CM ) is the median of ( triangle ABC ). 5. Secondly, because the triangles ( triangle ACM ) and ( triangle BCM ) are congruent, we infer that ( angle AMC = angle BMC ). Since ( AM = BM ), the angles ( angle AMC ) and ( angle BMC ) sum up to ( 180^circ ): [ angle AMC + angle BMC = 180^circ ] 6. Given that these two angles are equal, each must be ( 90^circ ): [ angle AMC = angle BMC = 90^circ ] 7. Therefore, ( CM ) is perpendicular to ( AB ) and hence, it is the height (or altitude) of the triangle ( triangle ABC ) from vertex ( C ). # Conclusion: Since ( CM ) is both a median and an altitude in the isosceles triangle ( triangle ABC ), we have successfully proved that the angle bisector of the isosceles triangle, drawn from the vertex to the base, serves as both the median and the altitude.

For f(x) to have 3 zeros, {f'}(x) must have two distinct real roots, implying that the function f(x) has a local maximum and a local minimum. This leads us to consider the conditions under which {f'}(x) = 0 has real solutions: 2. Solving {f'}(x) = 3x^2 + a = 0 for x gives us the critical points of f(x). The discriminant of this quadratic equation in x is Delta = 0 - 4 cdot 3 cdot a = -12a. For the equation to have real roots, we require Delta > 0: 3. Delta = -12a > 0 Rightarrow a < 0. Next, we analyze the behavior of f(x) based on the sign of {f'}(x): 4. When {f'}(x) > 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing. This occurs for x > sqrt{-frac{a}{3}} or x < -sqrt{-frac{a}{3}}. 5. When {f'}(x) < 0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing. This happens for -sqrt{-frac{a}{3}} < x < sqrt{-frac{a}{3}}. To ensure f(x) has 3 zeros, we need f(x) to reach a maximum and a minimum within these intervals. Thus, we evaluate f(x) at the critical points: 6. At x = -sqrt{-frac{a}{3}}, f(x) reaches a maximum. We require this maximum to be greater than 0. 7. At x = sqrt{-frac{a}{3}}, f(x) reaches a minimum. We require this minimum to be less than 0. Substituting these x values into f(x) and simplifying gives us two conditions: 8. -sqrt{-frac{a}{3}} times frac{2a}{3} + 2 > 0 always holds due to the nature of the function. 9. sqrt{-frac{a}{3}} times frac{2a}{3} + 2 < 0 leads to 2 < -sqrt{-frac{a}{3}} times frac{2a}{3}. Squaring both sides of the inequality and simplifying, we find: 10. 4 < -frac{a}{3} times frac{4a^2}{9} Rightarrow a^3 < -27.

What is the percentage decrease in the number of hours worked per week when Jane works with an assistant?","completion":"Let's denote the number of bears Jane makes on her own per week as B and the number of hours she works per week as H. Her rate of making bears on her own is B/H bears per hour. When Jane works with an assistant, she makes 80% more bears, so she makes 1.8B bears per week. The problem also states that her output per hour increases by 100%, so her new rate with an assistant is 2(B/H) bears per hour. We can set up an equation to find the new number of hours she works with an assistant, which we'll call H': 1.8B = 2(B/H) * H' Now we can solve for H': H' = (1.8B) / (2(B/H)) H' = (1.8/2) * H H' = 0.9 * H This means that Jane works 90% of the hours she used to work when she has an assistant. To find the percentage decrease in the number of hours worked, we subtract this from 100%: Percentage decrease = 100% - 90% = 10% So, the percentage decrease in the number of hours worked per week when Jane works with an assistant is boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"At Greenwood School, frac{3}{4} of the freshmen and frac{1}{3} of the sophomores participated in a science quiz.

For overline{xx , yy} to be a perfect square, overline{x0y} must be divisible by 11, and the quotient must itself be a perfect square. Let's denote overline{x0y} as 100x + y. 4. Next, we need to find x and y such that 100x + y is divisible by 11. Therefore, 100x + y = 11k for some integer k, where 11k is a perfect square. 5. The expression 100x + y simplifies further. For overline{x0y}=100x + y to be a valid three-digit number that fits the requirement, we note that: [ 100x + y quad text{must be a perfect square and divisible by 11} ] 6. Let's test values for x and y that satisfy x + y = 11. We need to find one valid pair where the resulting number xy forms a three-digit perfect square: - For x = 7 and y = 4, we have: [ 100 cdot 7 + 4 = 700 + 4 = 704 quad text{(Check if 704 is divisible by 11 and ensure it's a perfect square)} ] 7. Let's validate it: - 7 + 4 = 11, it satisfies the divisibility requirement. - Check if 704 is a multiple of 11: [ 704 div 11 = 64 quad (text{since 64 is a perfect square, } 64 = 8^2) ] 8. Now, we see that 7744: [ overline{77 , 44} = 1000 cdot 7 + 100 cdot 7 + 10 cdot 4 + 4 = 7000 + 700 + 40 + 4 = 7744 ] Therefore, the number 7744 is indeed a perfect square of a natural number because: [ 7744 = 88^2 ] # Conclusion: The number 7744 is a perfect square, where: [ boxed{xx = 7, yy = 4} ] Hence, the conclusion is: [ boxed{7744 text{ is a perfect square natural number}} ]"},{"prompt":"A certain mountain has 3 paths leading to the summit from the east side and 2 paths from the west side.

Each cat has a tom sitting next to her that is heavier than her. 2. Let's represent this situation using arrows. Draw an arrow from each cat to the tom sitting next to her, indicating that the tom is heavier. 3. Since there are 19 cats, we will have 19 arrows because each cat has exactly one tom who is heavier and sitting next to her. 4. Now, we need to analyse the scenario from the toms' perspective. Each tom can have a cat on his left or right who is thinner than him. It means each tom can have two arrows pointing to him at maximum (one from the left and one from the right). 5. Since the total number of arrows is 19 and we know that each of the 10 toms can have at most two arrows pointing to them, we can calculate the relationship using the following inequality: [ 2 times 10 geq 19 implies 20 geq 19. ] This inequality holds true. 6. This logical deduction shows that there must be exactly one arrow from each cat to a tom, and since there are 19 cats and 19 arrows, each of the 10 toms will have at least one cat next to him with one additional tom receiving more than one cat's arrow. 7. Thus, each cat being thinner than the tom next to her and the number of total arrows matching perfectly indicates that: - Each tom must have at least one of the 19 cats thinner than him next to him. # Conclusion: Therefore, we conclude that there is at least one cat thinner than each tom next to them.

Hence, we have shown that the area of the triangle does not exceed frac{1}{sqrt{3}}. blacksquare Part (b) We need to prove that if the lengths of the segments AA_1, BB_1, and CC_1 do not exceed 1, the area of the triangle ABC does not exceed frac{1}{sqrt{3}}. 1. **Case 1: Triangle ABC is not acute (obtuse or right triangle)** - Assume without loss of generality that angle A geq 90^circ. - Therefore, AB leq BB_1 leq 1. - Similarly, the height from C which is h_c will be less than or equal to CC_1 leq 1. - Hence, [ S_{ABC} leq frac{1}{2} times 1 times 1 = frac{1}{2} < frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] - This satisfies the condition. 2. **Case 2: Triangle ABC is acute** - Let angle A be the smallest angle, so angle A leq 60^circ. - The height h_a that drops from A bisects angle A into two angles, each no greater than 30^circ. - Assume the angle adjacent to side AB is leq 30^circ. Then, [ AB leq frac{h_a}{cos(30^circ)} leq frac{2}{sqrt{3}} ] - Given h_c leq 1, [ S_{ABC} leq frac{1}{2} cdot AB cdot h_c leq frac{1}{2} cdot frac{2}{sqrt{3}} cdot 1 = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] - Thus, even for an acute triangle, the area condition holds true. Combining both cases, we conclude that if the lengths of the segments AA_1, BB_1, and CC_1 do not exceed 1, then the area of the triangle ABC does not exceed frac{1}{sqrt{3}}. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given an ellipse G: frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > b > 0) with eccentricity frac{sqrt{6}}{3}, and its left focus at (2sqrt{2}, 0).

This implies (c > a + b). Since (b+c-a) and (c+a-b) are positive (as (a), (b), and (c) are positive and (c > a + b)), the right side of the inequality: [ (a+b-c)(b+c-a)(c+a-b) ] is negative because it contains the factor (a+b-c < 0).

Therefore, for lines l: (a+2)x + ay - 2 = 0 and n: (a-2)x + 3y - 6 = 0, we equate their slopes: [ -frac{a+2}{a} = -frac{a-2}{3} ] Cross multiplying gives: [ 3(a+2) = a(a-2) ] Expanding and simplifying: [ 3a + 6 = a^2 - 2a ] [ a^2 - 5a - 6 = 0 ] Factoring: [ (a-6)(a+1) = 0 ] Thus, a=6 or a=-1. Therefore, option A is correct. **Option B:** For lines l and n to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1. Using the slopes from above: [ -frac{a+2}{a} cdot -frac{a-2}{3} = -1 ] Simplifying: [ frac{(a+2)(a-2)}{3a} = -1 ] [ (a+2)(a-2) + 3a = 0 ] Expanding: [ a^2 - 4 + 3a = 0 ] [ a^2 + 3a - 4 = 0 ] Factoring or using the quadratic formula gives a=-4 or a=1.

Therefore, option C is correct. **Option D:** For the x-axis intercept of line n, set y=0: [ (a-2)x - 6 = 0 ] Solving for x: [ x = frac{6}{a-2} ] Given that the intercept is 6, we have: [ frac{6}{a-2} = 6 ] Solving for a: [ a-2 = 1 ] [ a = 3 ] Substituting a=3 into the equation of line n: [ (3-2)x + 3y - 6 = 0 ] [ x + 3y - 6 = 0 ] Rearranging for the slope-intercept form: [ 3y = -x + 6 ] [ y = -frac{1}{3}x + 2 ] Therefore, option D is incorrect because it states the intercept form incorrectly.

The derivative q'(x) = frac{1}{cos^2 x} - 1 > 0, indicating q(x) is monotonically increasing in (0, frac{pi}{2}). Therefore, for x in (0, frac{pi}{2}), we have q(x) > q(0) = 0, which means tan x > x. Thus, we conclude that for x in (0, frac{pi}{2}), sin x < x < tan x. **Step 2: Apply the inequality to the given problem.** Given 3^m = e, we find m by taking the natural logarithm on both sides, yielding m = frac{1}{ln 3}. This value of m falls within the interval (0,1), which is a subset of (0, frac{pi}{2}). Therefore, the inequalities sin m < m < tan m apply. **Step 3: Compare a, b, and c.** - Since frac{sin m}{cos m} = tan m > m, we have frac{sin m}{m} > cos m, which means c > a. - To compare a and b, consider a - b = cos m - 1 + frac{1}{2}m^2. Define f(x) = cos x - 1 + frac{1}{2}x^2 for x in (0,1). The derivative f'(x) = -sin x + x > 0 for x in (0,1), indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing in (0,1). Therefore, f(x) > f(0) = 0, which means a - b > 0 or a > b. Combining these comparisons, we conclude that c > a > b. **Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{B}.**"},{"prompt":"Find the greatest common divisor of 11,121 and 12,012.","completion":"Observing the pattern: - 11,121 = 11 times 1011 - 12,012 = 12 times 1001 Factoring each of these: - 11,121 = 11 times (11 times 92) simplified as 11^2 times 92 - 12,012 = 12 times (3 times 334) simplified as 3 times 4 times 334 Examine the factored numbers: - Factors of 11,121 are 11, 11, 92 - Factors of 12,012 are 3, 4, 334 Prime factorization: - 11,121 = 11^2 times 92 - 12,012 = 3 times 2^2 times 334 Identifying common factors: - No common prime factors between 11,121 and 12,012.

Since the parabola opens downwards, any intersection with y=-1 must occur between the intersections with the x-axis, leading to x_{1} < -1 and x_{2} > 3. Thus, conclusion ④ is correct.

Suppose for contradiction that (f(n) > n) for some (n). Let (n_0) be the smallest integer for which (f(n_0) > n_0). Then, we can substitute (n=n_0-1) to get: [ f(n_0) > f[f(n_0-1)] ] However, (f[f(n_0-1)]) is an integer and by our assumption (f(n_0-1) leq n_0-1), giving us: [ f[f(n_0-1)] leq f(n_0-1) leq n_0-1 ] Therefore, [ f(n_0) > n_0-1 ] but (f(n_0)) is an integer, hence (f(n_0) geq n_0).

Therefore, (f(n) leq n) for all (n). 3. **Exact Bounds:** Given that (f(n)leq n), we assert (f(n+1) > f[f(n)]). Since (f(n) leq n), it then follows that: [ f(n+1) > f[f(n)] geq f(n) ] Thus (f) is increasing. 4. **Exploring the Exact Nature:** Suppose (f(k) < k) for some (k). Then (f) can only take values in ({ 1, 2, ldots, n-1}) when it acts on (k-1) elements.

One large meeting has 500 delegates. If each delegate knows 400 people (stipulated: if A knows B, then B also knows A), is it guaranteed that 6 delegates can be chosen such that every two of them know each other? 1. To determine whether it's possible to select 6 delegates such that each pair of them knows each other, we will construct a counterexample. 2. Consider using the concept of **complete graphs**. Let's construct five complete graphs, denoted as ( K_{100} ): - A complete graph ( K_{100} ) is a graph where each pair of nodes has a direct connection. - Thus, each delegate within this ( K_{100} ) structure knows every other delegate within the same ( K_{100} ). 3. Now, let's represent each node in these complete graphs as a delegate. 4. By design, if two delegates do not know each other, we connect them in a way (with an edge) in the graph such that they belong to different complete graphs. - Therefore, any delegate from ( K_{100} ) does not connect directly to any delegate from another ( K_{100} ). This means delegates in different ( K_{100} ) groups do not know each other. 5. Count the number of people each delegate knows: - Since each complete graph ( K_{100} ) has 100 delegates, and each delegate in a ( K_{100} ) knows 99 others within their graph and does not know 400 - 99 = 401 delegates outside this graph but knows 400, keep them within acceptable conditions. 6. To analyze the problem: - Consider arbitrary selection of 6 delegates. - These 6 delegates could either be: - All chosen from the same ( K_{100} ): All pairs know each other. - Chosen across different ( K_{100} )'s: We must prove there's **no guarantee of all pairs knowing each other**. 7. Visualize the combination over the graphs: - For example, with five ( K_{100} )'s and taking 6 delegates randomly, it’s guaranteed at least any two delegates within a randomly selected subset will belong to the same ( K_{100} ), yet all delegates will not necessarily know each other due to cross complete graphing. - *By Pigeonhole Principle*: If 6 delegates are chosen from 5 groups, at least one ( K_{100} ) will have at least two delegates from the subset of six taken. 8. Conclusion: - Since these delegates are within diverse complete graphs, it ensures that at least a pair within those 6 chosen delegates does not know each other.

Given that every odd integer can be written in the form (2k + 1), we start by calculating ((2k + 1)^2): [ (2k + 1)^2 = (2k + 1)(2k + 1) ] Expanding using the distributive property: [ (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 ] We can factor out 4 from the first two terms: [ 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k^2 + k) + 1 ] Here, (k^2 + k) is an integer.

Thus, let (k(k + 1) = 2m) for some integer (m): [ 4(k^2 + k) = 4(2m) = 8m ] This means (4(k^2 + k)) is a multiple of 8. Rewriting the expression, we get: [ 4(k^2 + k) + 1 = 8m + 1 ] This simplifies to: [ (2k + 1)^2 = 8m + 1 ] Thus, the remainder when ((2k + 1)^2) is divided by 8 is 1.

This height also represents the distance from point E to the plane ABCD because the triangle is perpendicular to the plane. 3. **Express the radius of the circumscribed sphere (R) in terms of d**: We know that R^{2} = left(frac{sqrt{AD^2 + AB^2}}{2}right)^{2} + d^{2}.

Within one period, from 0 to 2pi, the cosine function starts at 1, decreases to -1 at pi, and returns to 1 at 2pi. 2. **Monotonic Increase Interval**: For y=cos x to be monotonically increasing, we need to find an interval where the function values are increasing as x increases. From the behavior of the cosine function, we know that it is monotonically increasing in the interval left[-pi, 0right] because, in this interval, the function values increase from -1 back to 1. 3. **Applying the Given Condition**: The problem states that y=cos x is monotonically increasing on the interval left[-pi ,aright]. Given our understanding from step 2, for the function to be monotonically increasing on this interval, a must be within the interval where cos x is increasing.

Given that the existing structure allows exactly one non-overlapping path (i.e., it forms a tree), we need to ensure an additional degree of connectivity. 2. **Graph Representation**: - Model the cities as vertices and the roads as edges of a graph. - Given that the graph of the cities and roads is a tree (a connected acyclic graph), the total number of edges in this graph is (99) (since a tree with (n) vertices has (n-1) edges). - Each city is connected to exactly one other city (each vertex has a degree of one), which implies we have 100 leaf vertices. 3. **Tree Analysis**: - In graph theory, a tree (T) with (n) vertices is characterized by the property that there is exactly one path between any pair of vertices. - Given this and the information that the graph has exactly 100 leaves, we can enhance the connectivity by adding edges between these leaf vertices. 4. **Pairs of Leaves**: - Let (A_1, A_2, ..., A_{100}) be the leaf vertices of the tree (T). - We aim to add 50 new edges such that they form pairs ({(A_i, A_j)}) with (1 leq A_i, A_j leq 100). 5. **Optimal Pairing**: - Consider all possible ways to pair these 100 leaf vertices into 50 pairs. - By the properties of trees and distances (d(A_i, A_j)) between nodes (approximated by the count of edges on the unique path connecting them), we can compute the sum of the distances for each pair configuration and choose the one which maximizes this sum. 6. **Graph Connectivity after Adding New Edges**: - Adding 50 new edges between the wisely selected pairs of leaf nodes will create cycles in the graph. - These cycles ensure that the removal of any single edge does not disconnect the graph (since an alternate path would always exist within these cycles). 7. **Proof of Connectivity**: - Suppose removing any edge (BC) may disconnect the graph. - Since (BC) is part of the tree initially and not among the newly added edges, the structure should allow reconnection through a path passing through the newly formed cycles. - Given the selected pairs with maximal sums of distances, any path between leaf nodes (A_i, A_j) or (A_k, A_m) would utilize the connecting structure proving connectivity. 8. **Conclusion**: - Our strategic addition yields: d(A_i, A_j) + d(A_k, A_m) = d(A_i, A_k) + d(A_j, A_m) - 2 which confirms the maximum connectivity without disconnection when any edge is removed.

Expanding and rearranging the inequality gives us the quadratic inequality: x^2 - (m + 2)x + (2m - 1) > 0. Since the inequality must be satisfied for all real numbers x, we need to examine the discriminant Delta of the corresponding quadratic equation x^2 - (m + 2)x + (2m - 1) = 0. The discriminant Delta is defined as Delta = (m + 2)^2 - 4(2m - 1). For the inequality to hold for all real x, the quadratic equation must not have any real roots. Therefore, we set the discriminant to be less than zero: Delta < 0, (m + 2)^2 - 4(2m - 1) < 0, m^2 + 4m + 4 - 8m + 4 < 0, m^2 - 4m + 8 < 0. Solving for m, we find that the quadratic function m^2 - 4m + 8 is always positive due to the vertex being at m = 2 and the discriminant being negative (since the coefficient in front of m^2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards). This implies that the initial condition m^2 - 4m + 8 < 0 can never be satisfied for any real m. However, this contradicts our initial steps, indicating that there was an error in the process. Let's correct the discriminant calculation: The corrected discriminant Delta should be given by: Delta = (-(m + 2))^2 - 4(2m - 1), Delta = (m + 2)^2 - 8m + 4. Setting the discriminant to less than zero: Delta < 0, (m + 2)^2 - 8m + 4 < 0, m^2 + 4m + 4 - 8m + 4 < 0, m^2 - 4m + 8 < 0. Upon re-evaluation, we realize that we made the same error as before. Let's correct the discriminant calculation once more: The corrected discriminant Delta should instead be: Delta = (m - 2)^2 - 4(1 - 2m), Delta = m^2 - 4m + 4 - 4 + 8m, Delta = m^2 + 4m. Now, setting this corrected discriminant to less than zero, we get: m^2 + 4m < 0. Factoring out m, we have: m(m + 4) < 0. This inequality is satisfied when m lies between the roots m = 0 and m = -4.

Find the sum of A, B, C, and D in the fourdigit addition formula DCBA+ABCD=ABCD0.","completion":"Let's analyze the given four-digit addition formula: DCBA + ABCD --------- ABCD0 We are given that A, B, C, and D are different numbers. The sum results in a five-digit number ABCD0, where the last digit is 0. This means that when A (the units digit of the first number) is added to D (the units digit of the second number), the sum must be a multiple of 10. Since A and D are different, the only possibility is that A + D = 10. Now, let's look at the tens place. We have B (from DCBA) adding to C (from ABCD), and since we are carrying over 1 from the previous addition of A and D, we have B + C + 1. This sum must give us a result where the tens digit is D and the units digit contributes to the next carry over. Since A + D = 10, we know D cannot be 9 because A and D are different and A cannot be 0 (otherwise, it wouldn't be a four-digit number). Therefore, the maximum value for D is 8, which would make A = 2. This means the maximum value for B + C + 1 is 18 (if B and C were both 9, which is not possible since all digits are different). So, B + C + 1 must equal 10 + D. Moving to the hundreds place, we have C (from DCBA) adding to B (from ABCD), and we are carrying over 1 from the tens place. So, we have C + B + 1. This sum must give us a result where the hundreds digit is C and the units digit contributes to the next carry over. Since we already have B + C + 1 = 10 + D, we can deduce that C + B + 1 must also equal 10 + B. Finally, looking at the thousands place, we have D (from DCBA) adding to A (from ABCD), and we are carrying over 1 from the hundreds place. So, we have D + A + 1. This sum must give us a result where the thousands digit is A and the units digit contributes to the next carry over. Since A + D = 10, we know that D + A + 1 = 11, which means the carry over to the ten-thousands place is 1, giving us the A in the ten-thousands place of the result ABCD0. Now, let's find the values of A, B, C, and D that satisfy these conditions: 1. A + D = 10 2. B + C + 1 = 10 + D 3. C + B + 1 = 10 + B 4. D + A + 1 = 11 From condition 1, we know that A and D are complements to 10. Let's assume A = 1 and D = 9 (we can switch them later if needed). With A = 1 and D = 9, condition 4 is satisfied (1 + 9 + 1 = 11). Now, let's use condition 2 with D = 9: B + C + 1 = 19. Since B and C are different and cannot be 1 or 9, the possible pairs are (B, C) = (8, 0) or (0, 8). Let's choose B = 8 and C = 0 (we can switch them later if needed). With B = 8 and C = 0, condition 3 is satisfied (0 + 8 + 1 = 9, which is 10 + 0 - 1). Now we have A = 1, B = 8, C = 0, and D = 9. The sum of A, B, C, and D is: A + B + C + D = 1 + 8 + 0 + 9 = 18 Therefore, the sum of A, B, C, and D is boxed{18} ."},{"prompt":"Determine the slopes of the asymptotes for the hyperbola defined by the equation [frac{y^2}{16} frac{x^2}{9} = 1.]","completion":"To find the equations of the asymptotes for the hyperbola, replace the right-hand side of the equation with 0, which simplifies the equation: [frac{y^2}{16} - frac{x^2}{9} = 0] Rewriting this, we get: [frac{y^2}{16} = frac{x^2}{9}] Solving for y: [y^2 = frac{16}{9}x^2] [y = pm frac{4}{3}x] Thus, the slopes m of the asymptotes are boxed{frac{4}{3}}."},{"prompt":"Given U={1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, A={2,4,5}, B={1,3,5,7}, then Acap (complement _{U}B)=left( right) A: {1,3,4} B: {3,4} C: {2,4,6} D: {2,4}","completion":"Given: - Universal set U={1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, - Set A={2,4,5}, - Set B={1,3,5,7}.

In 6 hours, Hillary climbs: ( 800 text{ ft/hr} times 6 text{ hr} = 4800 text{ ft} ) So, Hillary stops at: ( D - 1000 = 4800 text{ ft} ) ( D = 4800 + 1000 ) ( D = 5800 text{ ft} ) In the same 6 hours, Eddy climbs: ( 500 text{ ft/hr} times 6 text{ hr} = 3000 text{ ft} ) Since they pass each other at this point, the distance Eddy has climbed (3000 ft) plus the distance Hillary has descended must equal the distance Hillary climbed before descending. Hillary descends at a rate of 1000 ft/hr. Let's denote the time it takes for Hillary to descend and meet Eddy as t (in hours). So, Hillary descends: ( 1000 text{ ft/hr} times t text{ hr} ) The distance Hillary descends plus the distance Eddy climbs equals the distance Hillary climbed before descending: ( 1000t + 3000 = 4800 ) ( 1000t = 4800 - 3000 ) ( 1000t = 1800 ) ( t = frac{1800}{1000} ) ( t = 1.8 text{ hr} ) Now, we can calculate the total distance from the base camp to the summit.

However, with only one equation, we have an infinite number of solutions. We need another piece of information to find a unique solution. If we don't have additional information, we can only express the solution in terms of one of the variables. For example, we can express y in terms of x: 20y = 160 - 30x y = (160 - 30x) / 20 y = 8 - 1.5x Now, since we cannot have a fraction of a drum, both x and y must be whole numbers.

We start by noting the constraints laid out in the problem: - overline{ab} must be a multiple of 2. - overline{abc} must be a multiple of 3. - overline{abcd} must be a multiple of 4. - overline{abcde} must be a multiple of 5. - overline{abcdef} must be a multiple of 6. 2. Given the above constraints, we can deduce: - Since overline{ab} is a multiple of 2, the digit b must be even. Possible values are 2, 4, 6. - Since overline{abcd} is a multiple of 4, the last two digits cd must form a number that is a multiple of 4. Here d must be even. Possible values are 2, 4, 6. - Since overline{abcdef} is a multiple of 6, it must satisfy both the conditions of being a multiple of 2 and 3. Thus, f must be even, restricting f to 2, 4, 6. 3. Since overline{abcde} needs to be a multiple of 5, e must be 5, as it is the only digit in the given set that ends in 5. 4. We now know: - b, d, and f can be 2, 4, 6 (the even digits) - e = 5 - a and c are the remaining digits, limited to 1, 3. 5. Analyzing the sum condition for overline{abc}: As overline{abc} is a multiple of 3, (a+b+c) must be divisible by 3. 6. We have: - For b = 2, a + c must satisfy 3 mid (a + 2 + c). Hence, a + c + 2 equiv 0 ; (textrm{mod } 3) Rightarrow a + c equiv 1 ; (textrm{mod } 3). So, a + c = 1 + 3 = 4. 7. With e = 5, other deductions are: - d must follow the condition for multiples of 4; testing out for this part is easier by checking the constituency of the six-digit number. 8. Extensive testing: Given possible six digit configurations: - Checking 123654: - overline{ab} = 12: divisible by 2. - overline{abc} = 123: divisible by 3. - overline{abcd} = 1236: divisible by 4. - overline{abcde} = 12365: divisible by 5. - overline{abcdef} = 123654: divisible by 6.

First, let's find the amount of tin in alloy A: Alloy A has a total weight of 225 kg and consists of lead and tin in the ratio 5:3. To find the amount of tin, we need to divide the total weight in the ratio of tin to the sum of the parts of the ratio. The sum of the parts of the ratio for alloy A is 5 (lead) + 3 (tin) = 8 parts.

Suppose the smallest number in the first column is ( 1 ). - Perform the row multiplication operation: - Multiply all numbers in any row containing the smallest number by ( 2 ). This operation ensures the smallest number becomes ( 2 ). - If the original minimum number is already greater than ( 1 ), skip this step. - Now, subtract ( 1 ) from every element in the first column: - The smallest number, which was ( 2 ) after the previous step, becomes ( 1 ) again. - Repeat this operation for all rows until all numbers in the first column are ( 1 ). 4. **Setting First Column to Zero**: - Once the first column of the matrix contains only ( 1 )’s, apply the column subtraction operation: - Subtract ( 1 ) from all elements in the first column to make them all ( 0 ). 5. **Proceed to Other Columns**: - Repeat the above steps for the second column, third column, and so on: - For the ( i )-th column, ensure all elements are ( 1 ) through the same row multiplication and column subtraction operations. - Finally, subtract ( 1 ) from all elements to make the entire column ( 0 ). 6. **Iteration Over All Columns**: - By continuing this method iteratively for all ( 5 ) columns, each column will eventually be reduced to ( 0 ).

According to the problem, the second tray holds a certain number of cups less than the first tray. Since the second tray holds 240 cups, we can express the number of cups the first tray holds as x = 240 + the difference in cups between the two trays. The total number of cups poured into both trays is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation: x (cups in the first tray) + 240 (cups in the second tray) = 500 Now, we need to find the value of x. We can rearrange the equation to solve for x: x + 240 = 500 x = 500 - 240 x = 260 So, the first tray holds 260 cups of batter, and the second tray holds 240 cups of batter. To find out how many cups less the second tray holds compared to the first tray, we subtract the number of cups in the second tray from the number of cups in the first tray: 260 (cups in the first tray) - 240 (cups in the second tray) = 20 Therefore, the second tray holds boxed{20} cups less than the first tray."},{"prompt":"Divide 2 teachers and 4 students into 2 groups to participate in social practice activities at locations A and B, respectively.

Define the function ( f(x) = frac{3x^2 - x}{1 + x^2} ). We aim to analyze the behavior of this function on the interval ((0, 1)). 2. To prove that ( f(x) ) is well-behaved (specifically, that it is non-decreasing or non-increasing), observe that for ( x_1, x_2 in (0, 1) ), [ (x_1 - x_2) cdot left( f(x_1) - f(x_2) right) geq 0. ] This inequality suggests that the sign of the difference ( f(x_1) - f(x_2) ) matches the sign of ( x_1 - x_2 ). 3.

If the exponent of every prime p is bounded, then arbitrarily large highly divisible n must be divisible by arbitrarily large primes.

Suppose pn is not highly divisible, so there exists some rational r < 1 such that rpn is highly divisible and d(rpn) > d(pn). It is clear that we require rpn > n. Suppose nu_p(r) = k, so let r = p^k r'. If multiplying n by r' multiplies d(n) by some rational t, then multiplying pn by r' does the same. Thus: [ frac{d(rpn)}{d(pn)} = t cdot frac{k + nu_p(n) + 2}{nu_p(n) + 2} > 1 ] On the other hand: [ frac{d(rn)}{d(n)} = t cdot frac{k + nu_p(n) + 1}{nu_p(n) + 1} ] If k geq 0, this is at least t cdot frac{k + nu_p(n) + 2}{nu_p(n) + 2} > 1, which contradicts the fact that n is highly divisible. Hence k < 0, but then nu_p(rpn) leq nu_p(n) and rpn > n, hence n cannot be extinct (by taking m = rpn in the definition): contradiction. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Find the smallest positive integer (a) such that there exists a positive odd number (n) that satisfies [ 2001 mid 55^{n} + a cdot 32^{n}. ]","completion":"To find the smallest positive integer (a) such that there exists an odd number (n) for which (2001) divides (55^n + a cdot 32^n), we perform the following steps. 1. **Factorization and Modular Congruences:** - Notice that (2001 = 23 times 87). - We're given (2001 mid 55^n + a cdot 32^n), so both (23 mid 55^n + a cdot 32^n) and (87 mid 55^n + a cdot 32^n) must hold. 2. **Consider Modulo 87:** [ 87 mid 55^n + a cdot 32^n implies 0 equiv 55^n + a cdot 32^n pmod{87} ] - Observe (55 equiv -32 pmod{87}), hence: [ 0 equiv (-32)^n + a cdot 32^n pmod{87} ] [ implies 0 equiv 32^n (a - 1) pmod{87} ] - Since (gcd(32^n, 87) = 1), it follows that: [ a - 1 equiv 0 pmod{87} implies a equiv 1 pmod{87} ] 3. **Consider Modulo 23:** [ 23 mid 55^n + a cdot 32^n implies 0 equiv 55^n + a cdot 32^n pmod{23} ] - Observe (55 equiv 9 pmod{23}), thus: [ 0 equiv 9^n + a cdot 32^n pmod{23} ] - Given (32 equiv 9 pmod{23}), we get: [ 0 equiv 9^n + a cdot 9^n pmod{23} ] [ implies 0 equiv 9^n (1 + a) pmod{23} ] - Since (gcd(9^n, 23) = 1), it follows that: [ 1 + a equiv 0 pmod{23} implies a equiv -1 pmod{23} ] 4. **Simultaneous Congruences:** - We have two congruences: [ a equiv 1 pmod{87} ] [ a equiv -1 pmod{23} ] 5. **Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:** - Let (a = 87k + 1), for some integer (k). - Substituting in the second congruence: [ 87k + 1 equiv -1 pmod{23} ] [ 87k equiv -2 pmod{23} ] [ implies 87 equiv -5 pmod{23} implies -5k equiv -2 pmod{23} ] [ implies 5k equiv 2 pmod{23} ] - Finding the modular inverse of (5) modulo (23) (which is (5^{-1} equiv 14 mod 23)): [ k equiv 2 cdot 14 pmod{23} implies k equiv 28 pmod{23} implies k equiv 5 pmod{23} ] - Thus, the smallest (k) is (5). 6. **Minimum Value of (a):** [ a = 87k + 1 = 87 cdot 5 + 1 = 436 ] Hence, the smallest positive integer (a) is [ boxed{436} ]"},{"prompt":"For which real values of ( x ) will the expression [ sqrt{2 sin x} sin x ] have the greatest value?","completion":"I.

So we can write the following equation: (2/3)P = (1/3)P + 90 To solve for P, we first eliminate the fractions by multiplying every term by 3 to get rid of the denominators: 3 * (2/3)P = 3 * (1/3)P + 3 * 90 2P = P + 270 Now, subtract P from both sides to get: 2P - P = 270 P = 270 So the total number of pages in the book is boxed{270} ."},{"prompt":"Let (a,b,c,d) be a solution to the systembegin{align*} a+b&=20, ab+c+d&=105, ad+bc&=225, cd&=144. end{align*} Find the greatest possible value of a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2.","completion":"First, construct a polynomial p(x) using the given sums and products of roots: [ p(x) = (x^2 + ax + c)(x^2 + bx + d) = x^4 + (a+b)x^3 + (ab+c+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + cd ] [ p(x) = x^4 + 20x^3 + 105x^2 + 225x + 144 ] Using the Rational Root Theorem and synthetic division, test possible factors: [ (x+4)(x^2 + 16x + 36) = x^3 + 20x^2 + 100x + 144 ] [ (x+9)(x+1)(x^2 + 10x + 16) = x^4 + 20x^3 + 105x^2 + 225x + 144 ] Thus, p(x) = (x+9)(x+1)(x^2 + 10x + 16) and the roots are x = -9, -1, -8, -2.

Solving for x in terms of y, we get [ x(4y + 50) = 500 - y^2 ] [ 4x(y + 12.5) = (25+y)(25-y) ] Thus, either y = -12.5 or 4x = 25 - y. This second equation can be rewritten as y = 25 - 4x. **Case 2: x < 0** The equation becomes y^2 + 4xy - 50x = 500. Isolating x, we obtain [ x(4y - 50) = 500 - y^2 ] [ 4x(y - 12.5) = (25+y)(25-y) ] So, either y = 12.5 or 4x = -y - 12.5. This is simplified to y = -12.5 - 4x.

If the TV cost her 400, and the refrigerator and washing machine together cost 600, what were her original savings?","completion":"Let's denote Linda's original savings as S. Linda spent 5/8 of her savings on furniture. So, the amount spent on furniture is (5/8) * S. She spent 25% (which is equivalent to 1/4) of her savings on a TV. So, the amount spent on the TV is (1/4) * S. We know the cost of the TV is 400, so we can write the equation for the TV as: (1/4) * S = 400 To find S, we solve for S: S = 400 * 4 S = 1600 Now we know that Linda's original savings were 1600. She spent 5/8 of her savings on furniture, so the amount spent on furniture is: (5/8) * 1600 = 1000 The refrigerator and washing machine together cost 600. Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on furniture, TV, refrigerator, and washing machine: Amount spent on furniture + Amount spent on TV + Amount spent on refrigerator and washing machine = 1000 + 400 + 600 = 2000 Since her original savings were 1600 and she spent a total of 2000, there seems to be a discrepancy. The total amount spent exceeds her original savings, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem: We know that Linda spent 5/8 of her savings on furniture and 1/4 on a TV. The rest was spent on a refrigerator and a washing machine. The fraction of her savings spent on the refrigerator and washing machine is the remaining part of her savings after spending on furniture and the TV. So, the fraction spent on the refrigerator and washing machine is: 1 - (5/8 + 1/4) To combine the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 8 in this case: 1 - (5/8 + 2/8) = 1 - 7/8 = 8/8 - 7/8 = 1/8 So, Linda spent 1/8 of her savings on the refrigerator and washing machine. We know the refrigerator and washing machine together cost 600, so we can write the equation for that as: (1/8) * S = 600 To find S, we solve for S: S = 600 * 8 S = 4800 Now we have the correct original savings amount.

We have overline{AC}=b, overline{BC}=a, overline{CD}=b_1, overline{DE}=overline{CF}=a_1.

To investigate the monotonicity of f(x), we first find its derivative, f'(x), which is given by: f'(x) = 1 + frac{a}{x^2} - frac{2}{x} = frac{x^2 - 2x + a}{x^2}. Setting f'(x) = 0, we get the equation x^2 - 2x + a = 0. The discriminant (Delta) of this quadratic equation is Delta = 4 - 4a. (i) When Delta leq 0, i.e., a geq 1, we have x^2 - 2x + a geq 0, meaning f'(x) geq 0 for all x in the domain. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty).

In the interval (0, x_2), we have f'(x) < 0, and in (x_2, +infty), f'(x) > 0. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, x_2) and increasing on (x_2, +infty). - If a > 0, then x_1 > 0. In the interval (0, x_1), f'(x) > 0, in (x_1, x_2), f'(x) < 0, and in (x_2, +infty), f'(x) > 0. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, x_1), decreasing on (x_1, x_2), and increasing on (x_2, +infty). In summary: - When a leq 0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, 1 + sqrt{1-a}) and increasing on (1 + sqrt{1-a}, +infty). - When 0 < a < 1, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, 1 - sqrt{1-a}), decreasing on (1 - sqrt{1-a}, 1 + sqrt{1-a}), and increasing on (1 + sqrt{1-a}, +infty). - When a geq 1, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). (2) (i) From part (1), for f(x) to have two extreme points x_1 and x_2 on (0, +infty), the equation x^2 - 2x + a = 0 must have two distinct real roots. Therefore, the range for a is 0 < a < 1.

Both potential triangles are correct as reflections over the perpendicular bisector of AB, classifying as congruent solutions. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"A fruit seller sells mangoes at the rate of Rs. 6 per kg and thereby loses 15%.

This is a combination problem, and we can use the binomial coefficient to determine the number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 4 for the 5s (the remaining positions will automatically be filled by the 3s). 2. **Apply the combination formula**: The formula for combinations is [ binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, ] where ( n ) is the total number of items (4 digits), and ( k ) is the number of items to choose (2 positions for the 5s). 3. **Calculate the binomial coefficient**: [ binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{4 times 3 times 2 times 1}{(2 times 1)(2 times 1)} = frac{24}{4} = 6. ] 4. **Alternative method - listing out the possibilities**: To confirm our calculation, we can list all the distinct arrangements: - Placing the 5’s in positions 1 and 2: 5533 - Placing the 5’s in positions 1 and 3: 5353 - Placing the 5’s in positions 1 and 4: 5335 - Placing the 5’s in positions 2 and 3: 3553 - Placing the 5’s in positions 2 and 4: 3535 - Placing the 5’s in positions 3 and 4: 3355 As we can see, there are indeed 6 distinct possibilities. # Conclusion: The number of different possibilities for Shawn's 4-digit password is ( boxed{6} )."},{"prompt":"The quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in a circle with center O .

Let (T_d) be the time taken to row downstream and (T_u) be the time taken to row upstream. The total time taken for the round trip is 1 hour, so we have: [ T_d + T_u = 1 ] The distance traveled is the same in both directions, so we can write the time taken to row downstream and upstream using the formula ( text{Time} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Speed}} ): [ T_d = frac{D}{6} ] [ T_u = frac{D}{4} ] Substituting these into the total time equation gives us: [ frac{D}{6} + frac{D}{4} = 1 ] To solve for (D), we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 12 in this case.

From the first equation, we can use properties of logarithms to solve: log_{2}(x - y) = 5 - log_{2}(x + y) implies log_{2}(x - y) + log_{2}(x + y) = 5. Using the property that log_{a}(m) + log_{a}(n) = log_{a}(mn), we get: [ log_{2}((x - y)(x + y)) = 5. ] Convert the logarithm expression back to the base-2 exponential form: [ (x - y)(x + y) = 2^5 = 32. ] Therefore, we have: [ x^2 - y^2 = 32. ] 4. From the second equation, solve the expression by properties of logarithms: frac{lg x - lg 4}{lg y - lg 3} = -1. Recall that lg a - lg b = lg frac{a}{b}, and thus: [ frac{lg frac{x}{4}}{lg frac{y}{3}} = -1. ] This implies: [ lg frac{x}{4} = - lg frac{y}{3}. ] Using the property that lg frac{a}{b} = -lg frac{b}{a}, we get: [ lg frac{x}{4} = lg frac{3}{y}. ] Therefore: [ frac{x}{4} = frac{3}{y}. ] Solving for x gives us: [ x = frac{12}{y}. ] 5.

Step 2: Understanding the function's behavior The base of the exponent is frac{1}{2}, which is between 0 and 1. For bases in this range, the function y=a^x (where 0 < a < 1) is a decreasing function. This means that as the exponent increases, the function value decreases. Step 3: Applying the decreasing nature to our function Since x^2-2xgeqslant -1, and the function y=left(frac{1}{2}right)^{x} decreases as x increases, it follows that for our function, y=left(frac{1}{2}right)^{x^2-2x} will decrease as x^2-2x increases from its minimum value. The minimum value of the exponent x^2-2x is -1, so the maximum value of f(x) is left(frac{1}{2}right)^{-1}=2.

First, let's find out how many shares he has bought. Since the shares are quoted at Rs. 8.25 each and he has invested Rs. 4455, we can calculate the number of shares by dividing the total investment by the price per share: Number of shares = Total investment / Price per share Number of shares = Rs. 4455 / Rs. 8.25 Now, let's calculate the number of shares: Number of shares = 4455 / 8.25 Number of shares = 540 So, the man has bought 540 shares.

For any integer ( k ), we consider the term ( (n - k)^n ): [ (n - k)^n equiv (-k)^n pmod{n} ] Since ( n ) is odd, raising (-k) to the power ( n ) gives: [ (-k)^n = -k^n ] Therefore: [ (n - k)^n equiv -k^n equiv -k^n pmod{n} ] Consequently, ( k^n + (n - k)^n ) is divisible by ( n ): [ k^n + (n - k)^n equiv k^n - k^n equiv 0 pmod{n} ] We can then pair the terms in the sum ( 1^n + 2^n + cdots + (n-1)^n ) as follows: [ sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k^n = sum_{k=1}^{frac{n-1}{2}} left(k^n + (n-k)^n right) ] Each pair sums to zero modulo ( n ), hence the whole sum is divisible by ( n ). Therefore, when ( n ) is odd, the condition holds that ( n ) divides ( 1^n + 2^n + cdots + (n-1)^n ). 2. **Case 2: ( n ) is even** Let ( n = 2^alpha m ), where ( m ) is an odd number and ( alpha ) is the 2-adic valuation of ( n ). We will use induction on (alpha) to show that for all odd ( k ): [ k^{2^alpha} equiv 1 pmod{2^alpha} ] **Base case**: For (alpha = 1), ( n = 2 ), and any odd ( k ): [ k^{2} equiv 1 pmod{2} ] This is trivial since ( k equiv 1 pmod{2} ). **Inductive step**: Assume for some ( alpha ): [ k^{2^alpha} equiv 1 pmod{2^alpha} ] For (alpha + 1): [ k^{2^{alpha + 1}} = (k^{2^alpha})^2 equiv 1^2 = 1 pmod{2^{alpha + 1}} ] This completes the induction.

Construct the point P on e for which the ratio P A / P B is maximum, and the point for which it is minimum.","completion":"For this problem, we need to determine a point P on a given line e such that the ratio frac{PA}{PB} is maximized and minimized. Here are the detailed steps to solve this problem: 1. **Geometric Locus for Constant Ratio**: According to geometric properties, the locus of points P on a plane such that the ratio frac{PA}{PB} = lambda, where A and B are given points and lambda is a constant, can be one of the following: - If (lambda = 1), the locus is the perpendicular bisector of the segment (AB). - If (lambda neq 1), the locus is a circle (k_{lambda}) that passes through (A) and (B) and serves as the Apollonius circle for ratio (lambda), i.e., it is the set of points (P) such that the distances (PA text{ and } PB) are in the given ratio. 2. **Characterizing the Regions Delimited by (k_{lambda})**: - Points inside the region of (k_{lambda}) containing (A) satisfy (frac{PA}{PB} < lambda). - Points inside the region of (k_{lambda}) containing (B) satisfy (frac{PA}{PB} > lambda). This property can be confirmed through an inversion transformation: a circle (k_{lambda}) maps point (A) to point (B) under this transformation, thus exchanging inside and outside regions with respect to the ratio. 3. **Seek Minimum and Maximum Ratio Points on Line (e)**: - Identify a point (P_1) on the line (e) such that all other points on one side of (P_1) yield a ratio (frac{PA}{PB} > frac{P_1 A}{P_1 B}). This (P_1) will be the point where the ratio is minimized. - Similarly, identify point (P_2) such that points on the other side of (P_2) yield a ratio (frac{PA}{PB} < frac{P_2 A}{P_2 B}). This (P_2) will give the maximum ratio. Points (P_1) and (P_2) must lie on opposite sides of (k_{lambda}). 4. **Intersection and Tangent Points**: - When (e) intersects (k'): - Let (M) be the intersection point. A new circle (k) centered at (M) through (A) and (B) presents a simpler Apollonius problem which involves the orthogonal intersection of circles. - Tangency in Apollonian properties dictates that the optimal (P_1) and (P_2) are found where line (e) is tangent to the circles inscribing appropriate ratios. - If (e) coincides with or is parallel to (k'): - The point of tangency will still determine areas of maximum and minimum ratio preservation, but specific construction of the ratio depends on the alignment (either side of A or B). 5. **Conclusion**: Through geometric construction, we identify these optimal points (P_1) and (P_2) based on circular segments formed from the intersection of (e) with the Apollonius circle (k), achieving maximum and minimum ratio values.

After investigation, it was found that if the selling price is reduced by 1, the store will sell 2 more sets on average per day. (1) When each set of badges earns a profit of 38, how many more sets can be sold per day? (2) In order to reduce inventory as soon as possible, how much should the price of each set of mascot badges be reduced so that the daily profit from selling mascot badges in the store reaches 1200?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Calculating the Increase in Sets Sold Given that reducing the selling price by 1 increases the number of sets sold by 2, we can calculate the increase in sets sold when the profit per set decreases from 40 to 38. The decrease in profit per set is 40 - 38 = 2. Since for every 1 decrease in profit, 2 more sets are sold, for a 2 decrease, the increase in sets sold per day is: 2 times 2 = 4 text{ sets}. Therefore, when each set of badges earns a profit of 38, boxed{4 text{ more sets can be sold per day}}. Part 2: Calculating the Price Reduction for a 1200 Daily Profit Let x be the reduction in the price of each set of mascot badges. The original profit per set is 40, and the original number of sets sold per day is 20. According to the problem, the new profit formula, considering the price reduction and increase in sets sold, is: (40 - x)(20 + 2x) = 1200. Expanding and simplifying the equation: 800 + 80x - 20x - 2x^2 = 1200, -2x^2 + 60x - 400 = 0. Dividing the entire equation by -2 gives: x^2 - 30x + 200 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we find the values of x: x_{1} = 20, quad x_{2} = 10. Since we are looking for the price reduction that allows the store to reach a daily profit of 1200, we consider the practical aspect of the problem. The value x_{2} = 10 does not meet the requirements as it implies a lesser reduction for reaching the target profit. Therefore, we discard x_{2} = 10. Thus, the price of each set of mascot badges should be reduced by boxed{20} to reach a daily profit from selling mascot badges of 1200."},{"prompt":"Let D be the circle with equation x^2 + 14y + 72 = y^2 12x.

Recall the binomial theorem which states: [ (1+x)^{m} = sum_{k=0}^{m} C_{m}^{k} x^{k} ] First, we expand ((1+x)^{2n}) and rewrite it as ((1+x)^n cdot (1+x)^n): [ (1+x)^{2n} = (1+x)^n (1+x)^n ] Using the binomial theorem on both sides, we get: [ sum_{k=0}^{2n} C_{2n}^{k} x^k = left( sum_{i=0}^{n} C_{n}^{i} x^i right) left( sum_{j=0}^{n} C_{n}^{j} x^j right) ] Next, we are particularly interested in the coefficient of (x^n) on both sides of the equation. The left-hand side is simply (C_{2n}^n x^n). On the right-hand side, we need to consider all terms of the form (x^i cdot x^j) such that (i+j = n). Thus, the coefficient of (x^n) is: [ C_{2n}^{n} = sum_{i+j=n} C_{n}^{i} C_{n}^{j} ] Using the identity (C_{n}^{k} = C_{n}^{n-k}) for binomial coefficients, and rewriting sum limits, we get: [ C_{2n}^{n} = sum_{k=0}^{n} (C_{n}^{k})^2 ] Thus, we have shown: [ sum_{k=0}^{n} (C_{n}^{k})^2 = C_{2n}^{n} ] Now, returning to the original problem: [ sum_{k=0}^{n} frac{(2n)!}{(k!)^2((n-k)!)^2} ] Notice that (frac{(2n)!}{(k!)^2((n-k)!)^2}) can be rewritten using binomial coefficients as: [ frac{(2n)!}{n! n!} sum_{k=0}^{n} frac{(n!)^2}{k! k!

What was the total revenue received that day?","completion":"Let's denote the number of kayaks rented out as K. According to the information given, there were 5 more canoes than kayaks rented out, so the number of canoes rented out would be K + 5. We also know that for every 4 canoes rented, there are 3 kayaks rented. This means that the ratio of canoes to kayaks is 4:3. So we can write the following equation based on the ratio: 4/3 = (K + 5)/K Now, let's solve for K: 4K = 3(K + 5) 4K = 3K + 15 4K - 3K = 15 K = 15 So, there were 15 kayaks rented out. Now we can find out the number of canoes: Canoes = K + 5 Canoes = 15 + 5 Canoes = 20 Now we can calculate the total revenue: Revenue from kayaks = K * 16/day Revenue from kayaks = 15 * 16 Revenue from kayaks = 240 Revenue from canoes = (K + 5) * 11/day Revenue from canoes = 20 * 11 Revenue from canoes = 220 Total revenue = Revenue from kayaks + Revenue from canoes Total revenue = 240 + 220 Total revenue = 460 The total revenue received that day was boxed{460} ."},{"prompt":"Sandra wants to buy some sweets.

Hint: Use the principle that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.","completion":"To solve for the range of (theta) given the problem, we can follow these detailed steps: 1. **Assume the Configuration:** - We are given a regular hexagon (ABCDEF) with side length (1). - A ball is struck from the midpoint (P) of (AB) and hits point (Q) on (BC), then continues to hit the sides (CD), (DE), (EF), (FA), and finally (AB). 2. **Similarity of Triangles:** - According to the properties of reflection (angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection): [ angle BPQ = angle RQC ] where (R) is a point on side (CD). - We observe the following: [ angle B = angle C = 120^circ ] Hence: ( triangle BPQ sim triangle RQC ) - From the similarity, we have: [ frac{BQ}{BP} = frac{CQ}{CR} ] 3. **Propagation of Similarities:** - Similarly, the ball continues to hit all other sides of the hexagon, maintaining the proportional relationships. Therefore, the following holds: [ frac{BQ}{BP} = frac{CQ}{CR} = frac{DS}{DR} = frac{ES}{ET} = frac{FU}{FT} = frac{AU}{AV} ] 4. **Setting Up Ratios:** - Let's denote: [ BQ = k quad text{and} quad 2k = frac{BQ}{BP} ] - Using the ratios at each side, we can express all lengths in terms of (k) and simplify: [ begin{array}{ll} BQ = k ; & CQ = 1 - k CR = frac{1 - k}{2k} ; & DR = frac{3k - 1}{2k} DS = 3k - 1 ; & ES = 2 - 3k ET = frac{2 - 3k}{2k} ; & FT = frac{5k - 2}{2k} FU = 5k - 2 ; & AU = 3 - 5k AV = frac{3 - 5k}{2k} . end{array} ] 5. **Inequalities Containment:** - For the ball to hit consecutively the sides as described, all calculated lengths must remain within the segments (between 0 and 1). Therefore: [ left{ begin{array}{l} 0 < k < 1 0 < frac{1 - k}{2k} < 1 0 < 3k - 1 < 1 0 < frac{2 - 3k}{2k} < 1 0 < 5k - 2 < 1 0 < frac{3 - 5k}{2k} < 1 end{array} right. ] - These inequalities simplify to: [ left{ begin{array}{l} 0 < k < 1 k > frac{1}{3} k < frac{2}{3} k > frac{2}{5} k < frac{3}{5} k > frac{3}{7} end{array} right. ] - Combining these, we get the possible range for (k): [ frac{3}{7} < k < frac{3}{5} ] 6. **Applying the Law of Sines:** - We know: [ frac{BP}{BQ} = frac{sin(60^circ - theta)}{sin theta} ] Consequently: [ frac{BP}{BQ} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} operatorname{cot} theta - frac{1}{2} ] - Given (frac{3}{7} < k < frac{3}{5}), we have: [ frac{6}{7} < frac{sqrt{3}}{2} operatorname{cot} theta - frac{1}{2} < frac{6}{5} ] 7. **Solving for (theta):** [ frac{6}{5} < frac{sqrt{3}}{2} operatorname{cot} theta - frac{1}{2} < frac{7}{6} ] [ frac{3}{10} sqrt{3} < operatorname{tan} theta < frac{3}{8} sqrt{3} ] 8. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, the range for (theta) is: [ boxed{ operatorname{arctan} left( frac{3 sqrt{3}}{10} right) < theta < operatorname{arctan} left( frac{3 sqrt{3}}{8} right) } ]"},{"prompt":"Given two circles defined by the equations: begin{cases} x=32cos θ y=42sin θend{cases} and begin{cases} x=3cos θ y=3sin θend{cases} Determine their positional relationship: A.

Proof of existence: Let ( T_a ) be a transversal with at least ( a ) amber cells, and ( T_b ) be a transversal with at least ( b ) bronze cells. For the transformation process from ( T_a ) to ( T_b ), we will use a swapping mechanism. Consider a cell ( c ) in ( T_a ) where this cell is amber. We swap ( c ) with cell ( c' ) in ( T_a ) to form an intermediate transversal, maintaining the condition that at any step, each row and column contains exactly one cell from the transversal. This swapping mechanism ensures that at intermediate steps, the number of amber cells could fluctuate between ( a ) and ( a + 1 ). # Conclusion: By using the above process iteratively, due to the intermediate value theorem in a discrete setting, there must be a configuration in some step where the number of amber cells exactly equals ( a ), implying that it’s possible to choose exactly ( a ) amber cells and ( b ) bronze cells such that no two lie in the same row or column.

We need to show that the angles formed by these bisectors satisfy angle (a, b) + angle (c, d) = 0^{circ}. 3. Consider the angles angle (a, b) and angle (c, d). Note that: [ angle (a, b) = angle (a, AB) + angle (AB, b) ] 4. Similarly: [ angle (c, d) = angle (c, CD) + angle (CD, d) ] 5. Since ABCD is a convex quadrilateral, we have the following angle bisector relations: [ angle (a, AB) = frac{angle (AD, AB)}{2}, quad angle (AB, b) = frac{angle (AB, BC)}{2} ] [ angle (c, CD) = frac{angle (CB, CD)}{2}, quad angle (CD, d) = frac{angle (CD, DA)}{2} ] 6. Substituting these into the expressions for angle (a, b) and angle (c, d): [ angle (a, b) = frac{angle (AD, AB)}{2} + frac{angle (AB, BC)}{2} ] [ angle (c, d) = frac{angle (CB, CD)}{2} + frac{angle (CD, DA)}{2} ] 7. Adding these together, we get: [ angle (a, b) + angle (c, d) = frac{angle (AD, AB)}{2} + frac{angle (AB, BC)}{2} + frac{angle (CB, CD)}{2} + frac{angle (CD, DA)}{2} ] 8. Since the sum of the internal angles of quadrilateral ABCD equals 360^circ: [ angle (AD, AB) + angle (AB, BC) + angle (CB, CD) + angle (CD, DA) = 360^circ ] 9. Hence, we have: [ frac{angle (AD, AB) + angle (AB, BC) + angle (CB, CD) + angle (CD, DA)}{2} = frac{360^circ}{2} = 180^circ ] 10. This shows that: [ angle (a, b) + angle (c, d) = 180^circ ] 11. Therefore, the bisectors of the angles of the convex quadrilateral ABCD form an inscribed quadrilateral, as the sum of opposite angles equals 180^circ. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The sum ( S_{n} ) of the first ( n ) terms of a sequence is given by the formula ( S_{n} = 3n^{2} ).

To determine if the sequence is an arithmetic progression, we first need to find the n-th term u_n. 2. Given the sum of the first n terms, S_n = 3n^2, the n-th term u_n is calculated by subtracting the sum of the first (n-1) terms from the sum of the first n terms. Mathematically, this is expressed as: [ u_n = S_n - S_{n-1} ] 3. Using the given formula for S_n, we substitute S_n and S_{n-1}: [ S_n = 3n^2 quad text{and} quad S_{n-1} = 3(n-1)^2 ] 4. Therefore, [ u_n = 3n^2 - 3(n-1)^2 ] 5. Next, we expand and simplify 3(n-1)^2: [ 3(n-1)^2 = 3(n^2 - 2n + 1) = 3n^2 - 6n + 3 ] 6. Substituting back, we get: [ u_n = 3n^2 - (3n^2 - 6n + 3) = 3n^2 - 3n^2 + 6n - 3 = 6n - 3 ] 7. To verify that the sequence is an arithmetic progression, we need to check that the difference between successive terms u_n and u_{n-1} is constant. We compute: [ u_n - u_{n-1} ] 8. Substitute u_n = 6n - 3 and u_{n-1} = 6(n-1) - 3: [ u_n - u_{n-1} = (6n - 3) - [6(n-1) - 3] ] 9. Simplify the expression: [ u_n - u_{n-1} = (6n - 3) - (6n - 6 - 3) = 6n - 3 - 6n + 6 + 3 = 6 ] 10. The difference between any two consecutive terms is always 6, so the sequence is indeed an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 6. 11. Finally, to find the first term u_1, we substitute n=1 into the formula for u_n: [ u_1 = 6 cdot 1 - 3 = 6 - 3 = 3 ] # Conclusion: The sequence is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 6 and the first term 3.

Next, note that angle BAT = 180^circ - angle BAP and angle ABR = 180^circ - angle ABP.

Since tradition alternates due to the dishonest nature between the groups, we can assert 6 groups of alternating pairs fitting describing boys, i.e., majority boys. 6. **Concluding Correct Distribution**: - Counting contradictions: There are 7 statements noting “boys” which imply truthfulness in specific nodes/results. - Conversely, since the boys and girls alternate, we have 6 statements denoting “majority girls” (false indicating). Thus, alternating patterns give length to 13 resulting indicative in one of modeller groups: - More groups: (x = 7) (boys), ensuring majority presence for 13 overall count.

The absolute value function will split the real number line into three intervals based on these roots: (-infty, -1), (-1, 3), and (3, infty). Since x^2 - 2x - 3 is negative within the interval (-1, 3) and positive outside, f(x) can be written as the piecewise function: f(x) = begin{cases} x^2 - 2x - 3, & text{if } x in (-infty, -1] cup [3, infty), -(x^2 - 2x - 3), & text{if } x in (-1, 3). end{cases} Notice that the expression f^3 (x) - 4 f^2(x) - f(x) + 4 can be factored into [f(x) - 1]^2 [f(x) - 4]. Thus, we can find the roots of this equation by solving f(x) - 1 = 0 and f(x) - 4 = 0. First, solve f(x) - 1 = 0: - For x in (-infty, -1] cup [3, infty), the equation becomes x^2 - 2x - 3 - 1 = 0, which simplifies to x^2 - 2x - 4 = 0. This equation has two real solutions. - For x in (-1, 3), the equation becomes -(x^2 - 2x - 3) - 1 = 0, or -x^2 + 2x + 4 = 0. This also has two real solutions.

This does not have a real solution since the discriminant 2^2 - 4(-1)(7) = -24 is negative. By examining the number of real solutions in each subinterval, we can count total solutions: - There are four real solutions for f(x) - 1 = 0. - There are two real solutions for f(x) - 4 = 0. - Notice that f(x) = 1 and f(x) = 4 do not share any solutions, because the quadratic x^2 - 2x - m = 0 has distinct solutions for different values of m. Therefore, combining these results, we have a total of 4 + 2 = 6 real solutions. However, since [f(x) - 1]^2 appears, any solution for f(x) - 1 = 0 will have multiplicity two. This is crucial since it implies that the solutions will not simply cross the x-axis; they will touch and turn around. So, we need to count them twice. As we have 4 solutions for f(x) - 1 = 0, we double this to take account of multiplicity, yielding 4 times 2 = 8, and then add the 2 solutions for f(x) - 4 = 0, resulting in a total of 8 + 2 = 10 solutions. It seems that we have overcounted. Given that we're checking against available options (5, 6, 7, 9) and the calculated answer doesn't match these, we need to reassess our calculation regarding multiplicity. Since the solutions of f(x) - 1 = 0 are counted twice due to the squared factor, the solution set for the equation [f(x) - 1]^2 [f(x) - 4] = 0 is spread over the intervals as follows: - Two different solutions in (-infty, -1], - Two different solutions in (-1, 3), - One repeated solution counted twice in (-infty, -1], - One repeated solution counted twice in [3, infty), - Two different solutions in (-infty, -1] or [3, infty) for f(x) - 4 = 0.

To determine if there's symmetry about the line x = frac{pi}{6} or about the point (-frac{pi}{6}, 0), we can analyze the periodicity and phase shift of the sine function. The sine function has a period of 2pi, therefore, any shifts along the x-axis would occur in intervals of kpi, where k is an integer. The phase of the function is shifted by frac{pi}{3} units to the left. We need to find the axis of symmetry or the center of symmetry that compensates for this phase shift. The axis or center of symmetry would be a vertical reflection line or a point that relates to the period of the function. For a center of symmetry of the form (x_0, 0), the relation must satisfy 2x + frac{pi}{3} = kpi. Solving for x_0, we get: x_0 = frac{kpi - frac{pi}{3}}{2} = frac{kpi}{2} - frac{pi}{6} When k = 0, we have x_0 = -frac{pi}{6}, which yields the point (-frac{pi}{6}, 0).

Thus, (DK = BK), making (K) the midpoint of (BD). 5. **Ratio of Segments in the Height Application**: If (L) is the midpoint of (CD), then (LM) is the angle bisector of (angle SLO) and (OL : SL = OM : SM = n : m). 6. **Trigonometric Relationships**: Since (CL = OL), [ tan beta = frac{CL}{SL} = frac{OL}{SL} = frac{n}{m} ] Given that ( sin beta = frac{DK}{DC} ) and [ sin frac{alpha}{2} = frac{OD}{DK} ] 7. **Combined Relationships**: Hence, [ sin frac{alpha}{2} sin beta = frac{OD}{DC} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ] 8. **Solution for (alpha)**: Squaring both sides, [ sin^2 frac{alpha}{2} sin^2 beta = frac{1}{2} ] Consequently, [ (1 - cos alpha) sin^2 beta = 1 implies cos alpha = 1 - frac{1}{sin^2 beta} ] Given, [ sin beta = frac{n}{m} implies cos alpha = 1 - frac{m^2}{n^2} ] Thus, [ cos alpha = -frac{n^2}{m^2} ] 9. **Final Angle Calculation**: [ alpha = arccos left(-frac{n^2}{m^2}right) = pi - arccos left(frac{n^2}{m^2}right) ] Conclusion: [ boxed{pi - arccos left( frac{n^2}{m^2} right)} ]"},{"prompt":"the right rectangular prism ABCDA_1B_1C_1D_1, with AA_1 = 2 and the base being a square with side length 1, E and F are the midpoints of edges B_1B and DA, respectively.

The formula for the area of a triangle is given by text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. In this case, the area is given as 30 square units. Given that one side of the triangle lies along the x-axis and the height is perpendicular to this side, we can consider the distance between the points (6,4) and (0,0) as the height of the triangle.

Gain percent is calculated based on the cost price, so we can write the following equation: SP = CP * (1 + Gain%) We know that the gain percent is 37.5%, which can be written as a decimal as 0.375. So we can rewrite the equation as: SP = CP * (1 + 0.375) SP = CP * 1.375 Now we have two expressions for the selling price, one in terms of the marked price and one in terms of the cost price. We can set them equal to each other: MP * 88% = CP * 1.375 Now we want to find what percentage of the marked price is the cost price. To do this, we can solve for CP/MP: CP/MP = (MP * 88%) / (CP * 1.375) Since we want to find CP as a percentage of MP, we can multiply both sides by 100: (CP/MP) * 100 = (MP * 88% * 100) / (CP * 1.375) We can simplify this by canceling out MP on both sides: (CP/MP) * 100 = (88% * 100) / 1.375 Now we can calculate the percentage: (CP/MP) * 100 = (88 / 1.375) * 100 (CP/MP) * 100 ≈ 64% Therefore, the cost price is approximately boxed{64%} of the marked price."},{"prompt":"an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, where a_n > 0, a_1^2 + a_7^2 + 2a_1a_7 = 4, find the sum of the first 7 terms.","completion":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a_n > 0, and a_1^2 + a_7^2 + 2a_1a_7 = 4, we can rewrite the equation in terms of the square of a binomial: (a_1 + a_7)^2 = 4.

Denote the point of motion as (A), with distances (a) from side (OB) and (b) from side (OC). 2. **Recognize the trigonometric relationships:** Since the internal angle is (60^circ), we can use the law of sines in the triangular region. 3. **Use the Law of Sines:** [ frac{OA}{sin(60^circ)} = frac{a}{sin(180^circ - (60^circ - alpha))} quad text{and} quad frac{OA}{sin(60^circ)} = frac{b}{sin(alpha)} ] Simplify: [ frac{OA}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = frac{a}{sin(alpha)} quad text{and} quad frac{OA}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = frac{b}{sin(60^circ - alpha)} ] 4. **Manipulate trigonometric equations:** Equating the two expressions: [ frac{a}{sin(alpha)} = frac{b}{sin(60^circ - alpha)} ] This leads to: [ frac{sin(60^circ - alpha)}{sin(alpha)} = frac{b}{a} ] 5. **Derive the cotangent identity:** Use the trigonometric identity for (sin(60^circ - alpha)): [ sin(60^circ - alpha) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos(alpha) - frac{1}{2} sin(alpha) ] Plugging this back in: [ frac{frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos(alpha) - frac{1}{2} sin(alpha)}{sin(alpha)} = frac{b}{a} ] Simplify to: [ frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cot(alpha) - frac{1}{2} = frac{b}{a} ] 6. **Solve for (cot(alpha)):** [ frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cot(alpha) = frac{b}{a} + frac{1}{2} ] [ cot(alpha) = frac{2b + a}{asqrt{3}} ] 7. **Calculate (sin(alpha)):** Since (sin^2(alpha) = frac{1}{1 + cot^2(alpha)}): [ sin(alpha) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{a}{sqrt{a^2 + ab + b^2}} ] 8. **Determine the length of path:** The total distance traveled is: [ OA + AB = a + frac{a}{sin(alpha)} ] Substituting for (sin(alpha)): [ a + frac{a sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{a^2 + ab + b^2}}{a} ] Simplifying this expression: [ a + 2 sqrt{frac{a^2+ab+b^2}{3}} ] # Conclusion: The length of the path traversed by the point is [ boxed{a + 2 sqrt{frac{a^2 + ab + b^2}{3}}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = (x+1)ln x, the tangent line of the curve y=f(x) at x=1 is y=ax+b.

The domain of f(x) is (0,+infty) since ln x is defined for x>0. - Calculating the derivative of f(x): [ {f'}(x) = frac{d}{dx}[(x+1)ln x] = ln x + frac{x+1}{x} ] - Evaluating {f'}(x) and f(x) at x=1 gives us: [ {f'}(1) = ln 1 + frac{1+1}{1} = 2, quad f(1) = (1+1)ln 1 = 0 ] Thus, the equation of the tangent line at x=1 is: [ y-0 = 2(x-1) implies y = 2x - 2 ] To prove f(x) > ax+b for x>1, we define a new function h(x): [ h(x) = f(x) - (2x-2) = (x+1)ln x - (2x-2) ] - Finding the derivative of h(x): [ {h'}(x) = ln x + frac{x+1}{x} - 2 ] Let g(x) = {h'}(x), then: [ {g'}(x) = frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{x^2} = frac{x-1}{x^2} ] For x > 1, we have {g'}(x) > 0, indicating that g(x) is monotonically increasing on (1,+infty). Since g(1) = 0, it follows that g(x) > 0 for x > 1, which means {h'}(x) > 0. Therefore, h(x) is monotonically increasing on (1,+infty), and since h(1) = 0, we conclude h(x) > 0 for x > 1. This implies f(x) > 2x - 2 for x > 1. **Proof of (2):** From (1), we know that for x > 1, (x+1)ln x > 2(x-1).

American Summits donated twice the number of bottled water than the number of dressed chickens donated by Foster Farms. So, American Summits donated 2 * 45 = 90 bottles of water. 3. Hormel donated three times the number of dressed chickens that Foster Farms donated. So, Hormel donated 3 * 45 = 135 dressed chickens. 4. Boudin Butchers donated one-third of the number of dressed chickens that Hormel donated. So, Boudin Butchers donated 1/3 * 135 = 45 dressed chickens. 5. Del Monte Foods donated 30 fewer bottles of water than American Summits. So, Del Monte Foods donated 90 - 30 = 60 bottles of water. 6. The total number of food items donated by Boudin Butchers and Del Monte Foods combined must be a multiple of 7. Boudin Butchers donated 45 dressed chickens, and Del Monte Foods donated 60 bottles of water, so combined they donated 45 + 60 = 105 items. 105 is a multiple of 7 (7 * 15 = 105). 7. The number of dressed chickens donated by Foster Farms is half the sum of the chickens donated by Hormel and Boudin Butchers. We already know Foster Farms donated 45 dressed chickens, so 45 = 1/2 * (Hormel chickens + Boudin chickens). We know Hormel donated 135 and Boudin donated 45, so 45 = 1/2 * (135 + 45), which is true. Now, let's add up all the donations: - Foster Farms: 45 dressed chickens - American Summits: 90 bottles of water - Hormel: 135 dressed chickens - Boudin Butchers: 45 dressed chickens - Del Monte Foods: 60 bottles of water Total donations = 45 (Foster Farms) + 90 (American Summits) + 135 (Hormel) + 45 (Boudin Butchers) + 60 (Del Monte Foods) = 375 food items.

P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money) r = the annual interest rate (in decimal) n = the number of times that interest is compounded per year t = the time the money is invested for, in years In this case, we know that: A = 117.05729564344323% of P (which means A = 1.1705729564344323 * P) P = the initial deposit n = 2 (since the interest is compounded semiannually) t = 2.5 years (from July 1st, 2007 to December 31st, 2009) We can now plug these values into the formula and solve for r: 1.1705729564344323 * P = P(1 + r/2)^(2*2.5) Divide both sides by P: 1.1705729564344323 = (1 + r/2)^(5) Now we need to solve for r. First, we take the fifth root of both sides to get rid of the exponent: (1.1705729564344323)^(1/5) = 1 + r/2 Now we calculate the fifth root of 1.1705729564344323: (1.1705729564344323)^(1/5) ≈ 1.031956 Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate r/2: 1.031956 - 1 = r/2 0.031956 = r/2 Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for r: r = 0.031956 * 2 r ≈ 0.063912 To express r as a percentage, we multiply by 100: r ≈ 0.063912 * 100 r ≈ 6.3912% Therefore, the annual interest rate is approximately boxed{6.3912%} ."},{"prompt":"Sarah needs to borrow 12,000 from a local credit union.

This implies that the function's period, T, must accommodate this symmetry. 2. **Determine the Relationship Between omega and the Period:** The period of the sine function is given by T = frac{2pi}{omega}. Given the axis of symmetry and the zero, we can establish a relationship for the period as frac{2n+1}{4} cdot frac{2pi}{omega} = frac{pi}{2}, where n in mathbb{Z}. Simplifying this equation gives us omega = 2n + 1. 3. **Constraint on the Period Based on the Given Interval:** Since f(x) has a minimum value but no maximum value on the interval (-frac{pi}{12}, frac{pi}{24}), the period must be at least as long as the length of this interval. This gives us T geq frac{pi}{24} + frac{pi}{12} = frac{pi}{8}. Substituting T = frac{2pi}{omega} into this inequality yields frac{2pi}{omega} geq frac{pi}{8}, which simplifies to omega leq 16. 4. **Finding the Maximum omega:** To find the maximum possible value of omega that satisfies all conditions, we consider the options given. The highest value under 16 is omega = 15, which is of the form 2n + 1. 5. **Verification for omega = 15:** Substituting omega = 15 into the function, we get f(x) = sin(15x + varphi). Given that -frac{pi}{4} is a zero, we have 15(-frac{pi}{4}) + varphi = kpi, which is consistent with varphi = -frac{pi}{4}. This makes the function y = f(x) = sin(15x - frac{pi}{4}). On the interval (-frac{pi}{12}, frac{pi}{24}), the argument of the sine function, 15x - frac{pi}{4}, falls within (-frac{3pi}{2}, frac{3pi}{8}), ensuring that the function has a minimum but no maximum value within this interval.

Part (2): Probability of Needing a Fifth Game to be Played To find the probability of needing a fifth game, we first calculate the probability of the game ending within four rounds. This happens in the following sequences: ABAB, ACAC, BCBC, and BABA. Each sequence has a probability of left(frac{1}{2}right)^4 because each game's outcome is independent with a frac{1}{2} chance of either player winning. Therefore, the probability of the game ending within four rounds is: [P = P(ABAB) + P(ACAC) + P(BCBC) + P(BABA) = 4 times left(frac{1}{2}right)^4 = frac{1}{4}] Thus, the probability of needing a fifth game is: [1 - frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4}] So, the probability of needing a fifth game to be played is boxed{frac{3}{4}}.

We can rewrite these numbers in terms of square roots to see the pattern more clearly: - First row: sqrt{2}, sqrt{4}, sqrt{6}, sqrt{8} - Second row: sqrt{10}, sqrt{12}, sqrt{14}, sqrt{16} From this, we observe that the pattern involves square roots of even numbers, starting from 2 and increasing by 2 for each subsequent number. Each row contains 4 numbers. Given that we need to find the position of 10sqrt{3}, we first express 10sqrt{3} in the form that fits the pattern, which is sqrt{300}. This is because 10sqrt{3} = sqrt{100 times 3} = sqrt{300}. To find the position of sqrt{300}, we note that 300 is the 150^{th} even number since the sequence of even numbers starts at 2 and increases by 2 each time. Therefore, the position in the sequence can be found by dividing 150 by the number of numbers per row, which is 4. Performing the division gives 150 div 4 = 37 remainder 2. This means that sqrt{300} is in the 38^{th} row (since we have to count the row that starts after completing 37 full rows) and is the 2^{nd} number in that row (as indicated by the remainder 2).

To isolate ( x_n ), consider the ratio: [ frac{S}{100^n} = frac{100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + ldots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1}}{100^n} + x_n ] 6. We need to show that the term ( frac{100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + ldots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1}}{100^n} ) is small enough to not interfere with identifying ( x_n ). 7. Since ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{n-1} ) are single-digit integers, we have: [ left| 100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + ldots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1} right| leq 9 left( 100 + 100^2 + ldots + 100^{n-1} right) ] 8. The series within the parentheses is a geometric series. Its sum is given by: [ 100 (1 + 100 + 100^2 + ldots + 100^{n-2}) = 100 left(frac{100^{n-1} - 1}{99}right) ] 9. Thus: [ left| 100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + ldots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1} right| leq 9 cdot 100 left(frac{100^{n-1} - 1}{99}right) ] 10. Now, divide by ( 100^n ): [ left| frac{100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + ldots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1}}{100^n} right| leq frac{900 (100^{n-1})}{99 cdot 100^n} = frac{9}{10^n} ] 11. This simplifies to: [ frac{9 cdot 10^{n-1}}{10^n} = frac{9}{10} ] 12. Since ( left|frac{9}{10}right| < 1 ), this term is less than 1, and specifically less than (frac{1}{10}) when ( n geq 1). This shows that the term ( frac{100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + ldots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1}}{100^n} ) is sufficiently small to not interfere with determining the single-digit ( x_n ) part. 13. Once we determine ( x_n ) by rounding ( frac{S}{100^n} ) to the nearest integer, we can subtract ( 100^n x_n ) from ( S ) to obtain a new sum ( S_2 ): [ S_2 = S - 100^n x_n = 100 x_1 + 100^2 x_2 + ldots + 100^{n-1} x_{n-1} ] 14. By repeating the process for ( S_2 ) and dividing by ( 100^{n-1} ), we can isolate ( x_{n-1} ). This process can be iteratively continued down to ( x_1 ). Conclusively, it is possible to determine all ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) using only one question and the method described.

The diameter of the circumscribed circle of this triangle is ______.","completion":"To determine the diameter of the circumscribed circle of a right triangle, we can use the properties of the triangle and the Pythagorean theorem. We have two cases to consider based on the given sides of the triangle: **Case 1: Hypotenuse is 16** - If the hypotenuse is the longest side and it is given as 16, then, in the case of a right triangle, the diameter of the circumscribed circle is equal to the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, the diameter of the circumscribed circle is 16. **Case 2: Legs are 16 and 12** - Given the lengths of the two legs as 16 and 12, we can find the length of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). Mathematically, this is c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Applying this, we get: [ c = sqrt{16^2 + 12^2} = sqrt{256 + 144} = sqrt{400} = 20 ] - Therefore, when the legs are 16 and 12, the hypotenuse is 20. In a right triangle, the diameter of the circumscribed circle is equal to the length of the hypotenuse, which means the diameter of the circumscribed circle is 20 in this case. **Conclusion:** Given the information, the diameter of the circumscribed circle of this right triangle can either be equal to the length of the hypotenuse when it is 16, or it can be calculated based on the lengths of the two legs, which gives a hypotenuse (and thus a diameter) of 20.

Each new edge belongs to a newly formed triangular face replacing the vertex. 4. **Count the new edges per vertex**: Each cut introduces 3 new edges, but note that each edge of the original tetrahedron is shared by two vertices, so each original edge will eventually be replaced by a new edge. 5. **Calculate the total number of edges**: - Original edges: 0 (all original edges are replaced) - New edges added from cuts: (3 times 4 = 12) (since each of the 4 vertices contributes 3 new edges) 6. **Conclusion with the number of edges**: - Total edges in the new figure = New edges added = 12.

Combining the results from g(x) and h(x), we conclude that for 0 < x < 1, we have x - x^2 < sin x < x.

Otherwise, only consider the endpoints: - ( gleft(-frac{b}{2a}right) = aleft(-frac{b}{2a}right)^2 + bleft(-frac{b}{2a}right) + c = frac{b^2}{4a} - frac{b^2}{2a} + c = frac{-b^2}{4a} + c ) Now, compare these values: - If ( -frac{b}{2a} ) is in ([-1, 2]), the range is determined by the minimum and maximum values of ( g(-1), g(2), gleft(-frac{b}{2a}right) ). - If ( -frac{b}{2a} ) is not in ([-1, 2]), the range is determined by ( g(-1) ) and ( g(2) ). Assuming the vertex is within the interval, compare ( g(-1), g(2), ) and ( gleft(-frac{b}{2a}right) ). Since ( a > 0 ), the minimum is either ( g(-1) ) or ( g(2) ), and the maximum is ( gleft(-frac{b}{2a}right) ) if it's within the range. Hence, the range of ( g ) is: [ boxed{left[min(g(-1), g(2)), max(g(-1), g(2), gleft(-frac{b}{2a}right))right]} ]"},{"prompt":"Spongebob works in a burger shop.

The angles ( 10^circ ) and ( -170^circ ) (since ( tan (10^circ - 180^circ) = tan (-170^circ) )) both satisfy the equation ( tan n^circ = tan 10^circ ). 3. Since both ( 10^circ ) and ( -170^circ ) are within the given range ( -180 < n < 180 ), the solutions are ( n = 10^circ ) and ( n = -170^circ ).

Define f(S) as the minimum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements of S. Find the maximum value of f(S). We proceed by considering two cases: Case 1: ( n = 2k ) (even number) 1. **Observation**: When (n) is even, we can group the numbers into pairs that maximizes the minimum absolute difference between any two adjacent elements. 2. We want to find an arrangement that ensures the minimum absolute difference is maximized. 3. Consider the sequence: [ S = (k+1, 1, k+2, 2, ldots, 2k, k) ] In this arrangement, we have the differences: [ |(k+1) - 1| = k, quad |(k+2) - 2| = k, quad ldots, quad |2k - k| = k ] 4. **Verification**: The minimum absolute differences between each pair is (k), hence: [ f(S) = k = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ] 5. Therefore, (f(S) leq k). Case 2: ( n = 2k + 1 ) (odd number) 1. **Observation**: When (n) is odd, we aim to arrange the numbers similarly to the even case, adding the last number appropriately. 2.

Find all such ( N ). 1. **Define ( m ):** Let ( m ) be the largest divisor of ( N ) which is smaller than ( N ). 2. **Express ( N ) in terms of ( m ):** Since ( m ) is a divisor of ( N ), we can write ( N ) as ( N = mp ), where ( p ) is the least prime divisor of ( N ). 3. **Set up the given condition:** According to the problem, we have ( N + m = 10^k ). Substituting ( N = mp ) into this equation gives: [ mp + m = 10^k ] Factoring out ( m ), we get: [ m(p + 1) = 10^k ] 4. **Analyze the properties of the equation:** Since ( 10^k ) is a power of ten, it is not divisible by 3. Therefore, ( p ) cannot be 3, and the smallest possible value for ( p ) is greater than 2. This implies that ( p ) must be one of the primes greater than 2 (i.e., 3, 5, 7, 11, ldots). 5. **Consider odd divisors:** Both ( m ) and ( p ) must be odd because ( 10^k ) is an even number, and multiplying only even numbers can give an even product. It follows from ( m(p + 1) = 10^k ) that ( m ) must also be a power of 5 because powers of 5 are the only divisors of ( 10^k ) that are odd. 6. **Check simple cases:** Let us test with ( p = 3 ). If ( p = 3 ), then: [ m(p + 1) = m cdot 4 = 10^k ] Hence, ( m ) must be ( frac{10^k}{4} ). - For ( k = 2 ), ( 10^2 = 100 ): [ m = frac{100}{4} = 25 ] So, ( N = mp = 25 cdot 3 = 75 ).

Let ( Omega ) be the nine-point circle of triangle ( ABC ). The nine-point circle ( Omega ) passes through the midpoints ( K, L, M ) and the feet of the altitudes, including ( H_C ). 3. **Intersection and homothety:** Denote ( L' ) as the intersection of ( LX ) and ( BC ). Since circles ( Omega ) and ( Gamma ) are externally tangent, there exists a homothety ( kappa ) centered at ( X ) such that ( kappa(Gamma) = Omega ). 4. **Collinearity and parallel chords:** Because points ( L', X, L ) are collinear and ( L in Omega ), ( L' in Gamma ), we have: [ kappa(L') = L ] Since ( BC parallel ML ), the segments ( L'B ) and ( ML ) are parallel chords of circles ( Gamma ) and ( Omega ) respectively.

However, these triangles are congruent and hence not a valid solution. 3. **Exploring alternative cuts**: - Another way to think of cutting a square might involve drawing lines from vertices or midpoints of the sides. 4. **Implementing a solution**: - Consider a different approach: draw a line to divide the square into one isosceles triangle and a smaller trapezoid. - Then proceed to divide the trapezoid into three more isosceles triangles by appropriately drawing lines. 5. **Determining the congruence**: - Upon constructing and measuring, it will become evident if the triangles are indeed not congruent. - Here, achieving non-congruence is significant because the shapes and sizes are not preserved through consistent angles and side lengths. 6. **Conclusion**: It is theoretically possible, but verifying each possible cut for practical confirmation that no triangles are congruent requires constructing different divides. Due to the complexity, exact geometrical proof is essential but beyond a simple draw. Final Thought: - Practical construction of such shapes requires geometric software or precise measurements.

This involves the sum (m_1 + m_9 + m_{10} + cdots + m_{22}). 5. **Analyzing the Responses:** By analyzing the parities of (R_I), (R_II), and (R_III), we observe: - Each of these sums includes the number of matches in box 1 (m_1). - Each of the other boxes in these sums (boxes 2 to 22) appears either two times (in two different sums) or zero times (not appearing at all). 6. **Key Observation:** Adding the parities (evenness or oddness) of (R_I), (R_II), and (R_III) should reveal the parity of the sum: (R_I + R_II + R_III = 3m_1 + (text{sum of other matches that appear twice})) The sum of a number appearing twice is always even. So, if we add the responses: - If m_1 is odd, then (3m_1) is odd. - If m_1 is even, then (3m_1) is even. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, by asking these three questions, Bea can determine if the parity of the sum (R_I + R_II + R_III) is odd or even, corresponding directly to the parity of m_1, the number of matches in box 1. Three questions are the minimum necessary because: - With fewer questions, (m_1) might end up not being included in any question, leading to an indeterminate solution. - Each relevant box, especially box 1, needs to be covered in at least one question while maintaining a correct system of overlapping boxes ensuring sufficient coverage and exclusion criteria when tested. # Conclusion: To determine the parity of the number of matches in box 1, Bea requires exactly 3 questions.

We denote ( G = CF cap BE ). Additionally, ( R ) and ( S ) are defined such that ( BCER ) and ( BCSF ) are parallelograms, respectively. 2. **Lemma Proof: Equal Tangents from a Point to a Circle** We introduce a general lemma for a circle and a point ( P ). The tangents from ( P ) to the circle touch at points ( A ) and ( B ), and we have ( PA = PB ). This lemma can be derived using the concept of the power of a point: The power of point ( P ) with respect to the circle is given by: [ PA^2 = PB^2 = text{Power of } P ] Thus, the tangents from a point ( P ) to a circle are equal in length. 3. **Applications of the Lemma to Geometry of the Triangle ( ABC )** Using the lemma, we assert the equality of certain key lengths in the given problem. Particularly, due to the property of tangents from a point to a circle: - ( ER = EC ) - ( FS = FB ) These conditions hold because of the parallelogram properties that cause parallelograms ( BCER ) and ( BCSF ) to form. 4. **Power of Point ( B )** Considering the excircle touching ( AC ) and ( BF ), we examine the power of point ( B ) with respect to this excircle. This power relates solely to the tangents drawn from ( B ) to the excircle. Therefore, the power is equal to ( BR^2 ). 5. **Power of Point ( E )** Similarly, for point ( E ), the power equates to the square of ( ER ): [ text{Power of } E = ER^2 = BC^2. ] This equality confirms that the radical axes of relevant circles will pass through ( E ). 6. **Radical Axis Analysis** The radical axis of the excircle and the circle centered at ( R ) with radius zero is the line ( BE ). Analogously, the radical axis of the excircle and the circle centered at ( S ) with a radius of zero is the line ( CF ). 7. **Intersection Point ( G )** Consequently, the point ( G = (BE) cap (CF) ) must reside on both these radical axes due to the intersection properties confirmed by the Radicals Axis Theorem. 8. **Conclusion** Since ( G ) is the point where these two radical axes of the circles intersect, it follows by the Radical Axes Theorem that the distances from ( G ) to ( R ) and from ( G ) to ( S ) must be equal: [ GR = GS. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{GR = GS} ] The conclusion is boxed, denoting that we have provided the sought-after geometric proof that the distances from ( G ) to points ( R ) and ( S ) are equal."},{"prompt":"For how many n in {1, 2, 3, ..., 200} is the tens digit of n^3 even?

Let's examine a few expressions more closely to determine a systematic way to find a^{10} + b^{10}. Firstly, we observe that: - The expression for a + b is given by a + b = 1. By squaring both sides, we obtain: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 We have the value of a^2 + b^2, so in order to relate it to a + b, we need the value of 2ab. We can calculate 2ab from the first two expressions as follows: 2ab = (a + b)^2 - (a^2 + b^2) = 1^2 - 3 = -2 To find a^3 + b^3, we can use the identity (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = a^3 + b^3.

We continue with this strategy to calculate a^{10} + b^{10}. The binomial theorem, which relates the powers of a + b to the individual powers of a and b, will be useful here. However, since a + b = 1, the only challenging part is calculating the various powers of ab. Note that ab = frac{-2}{2} = -1. Hence, ab raised to any even power is 1, and to any odd power is -1.

Also, the terms with odd powers of ab will become negative while the terms with even powers will be positive.

This means that the balloon will be tangent to the frame from the inside. Since the balloon remains spherical and touches the edges of the cubic frame, the radius of the balloon will be half the length of the space diagonal of the cube. For a cube with edge length a, the space diagonal has a length of sqrt{3}a. However, the balloon needs to fit inside the cube without distorting, so we should instead consider the face diagonal, which is shorter and has a length of sqrt{2}a. Thus, the diameter of the balloon is sqrt{2}a, and the radius r of the balloon is half of that, which means r = frac{sqrt{2}a}{2}. With the radius determined, the surface area A of the balloon can be calculated using the formula for the surface area of a sphere, A = 4pi r^2. Substituting the expression for r, we have: A = 4pi left(frac{sqrt{2}a}{2}right)^2 = 4pi frac{2a^2}{4} = pi a^2 However, the above calculation has a mistake, as we erroneously forgot to double the surface area.

Step 1: Analyzing Function Symmetry Using the given conditions, we start with: 1. ( f(2 - x) = f(2 + x) ) This implies that ( f(x) ) is symmetric about ( x = 2 ), i.e., shifting ( x ) to ( x + 4 ) or ( x - 4 ) gives the same value. 2.

Does there exist an n for which it is possible, after several moves, to arrange all the chips in reverse order?","completion":"1. We will approach this problem by contradiction. Suppose that for some integer n, it is possible to rearrange the n chips from the sequence (1, 2, ldots, n) into the sequence ( n, n-1, ldots, 1 ) using the allowed moves. 2. Represent the positions of the chips on a coordinate line at points with coordinates ( 1, 2, ldots, n ). 3. Observe the effect of swapping two chips that are three units apart. For any given move where we swap the chips at positions (i) and (i+3), the coordinates of the swapped chips change as follows: - The chip initially at coordinate (i) moves to coordinate (i+3). - The chip initially at coordinate (i+3) moves to coordinate (i). 4. Note that the coordinate transformation caused by such a swap can be described as the addition or subtraction of 3 units. Therefore: - Any chip that starts at an initial position (x) will, after any number of swaps, end up at a position (x + 3k) or (x - 3k) for some integer (k). 5. This implies that any chip's final position modulo 3 will be the same as its initial position modulo 3 because adding or subtracting multiples of 3 does not change the result modulo 3. 6. Let's analyze the initial and final positions modulo 3: - Initially, the chip at position (i) (where (i) runs from 1 to (n)) has coordinates (i mod 3). - In the final arrangement (n, n-1, ldots, 1), the chip that was initially at position (i) is now at position (n-i+1). 7. Consider specifically the chip initially at position (n). Initially, its coordinate is (n), which gives (n mod 3). In the final arrangement, this chip must end up at position 1. Thus, (1 mod 3) must be equal to (n mod 3). 8. Also consider the chip initially at position (n-1). Initially, its coordinate is (n-1), implying ((n-1) mod 3). In the final arrangement, this chip is at position 2. Thus, (2 mod 3) must be equal to ( (n-1) mod 3 ). 9. This generates the congruences: - ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ) - ( n-1 equiv 2 mod 3 ) These two congruences imply: - ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ) - ( n equiv 0 mod 3 ) 10. However, if (n equiv 1 mod 3), it cannot simultaneously be that ( n equiv 0 mod 3) unless both congruences hold different residues modulo 3. 11.

This means that when 60 is divided by 18, there is a remainder of 6, and when x is divided by 18, there is a remainder of 10. For 60, we can write the equation as: 60 = 18k + 6, where k is some integer. For x, we can write the equation as: x = 18m + 10, where m is some integer. Since we know that 60 divided by 18 leaves a remainder of 6, we can find the value of k by subtracting 6 from 60 and then dividing by 18: 60 - 6 = 54 54 / 18 = 3 So, k = 3, and we can confirm that 60 = 18 * 3 + 6. Now, we need to find the value of x. Since we don't know the value of m, we can't directly calculate x. However, we know that x leaves a remainder of 10 when divided by 18. This means that x is 10 more than a multiple of 18. The smallest such number would be 18 * 1 + 10 = 28, but this number is too small because it must be greater than 60 (since 60 leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 18, and we are looking for a number that leaves a remainder of 10). The next possible number would be 18 * 2 + 10 = 46, but this is still less than 60. The next possible number would be 18 * 3 + 10 = 64, and this is greater than 60. Therefore, the second number x that leaves a remainder of 10 when divided by 18 and is greater than 60 is boxed{64} ."},{"prompt":", b , c , d and e are 5 consecutive points on a straight line . if bc = 3 cd , de = 7 , ab = 5 and ac = 11 , what is the length of ae ?","completion":"Let's denote the lengths of the segments between the points as follows: AB = x BC = y CD = z DE = w We are given the following information: 1.

A rectangle that can be dissected into 15 congruent polygons that are not rectangles. 2. A square that can be dissected into 15 congruent polygons that are not rectangles. Step 1: Consider the Dissection of a Rectangle Assume there exists a polygon ( P ) such that 15 congruent polygons ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_{15} ), each congruent to ( P ), can form a rectangle ( R ). Given that the polygons are congruent and not rectangles, each ( P_i ) must have the same shape and the same dimensions, and they must tessellate to fill ( R ) completely. A suitable candidate for ( P ) would be an irregular polygon that can tile the plane. One such possibility is a right-angled triangle. 1. Consider a right-angled triangle where the two legs are of lengths ( a ) and ( b ), and the hypotenuse is not parallel to any side of the rectangle. 2. By reflecting and translating this triangle, it’s possible to form various tessellations. For example, the right-angled triangles can be arranged in a grid to form larger rectangular shapes (not necessarily squares) and tessellate the plane. If we can arrange 15 of these triangles to form a rectangle, then we have achieved the goal. Step 2: Transform the Rectangle into a Square To find a square that can be dissected into 15 congruent polygons which are not rectangles, we build on the first part. 1. Suppose the rectangle mentioned above can be re-proportioned while maintaining the congruence of the 15 units of dissection. Such an adjustment could be performed by stretching or compressing vertically or horizontally to turn the rectangle into a square. 2. If the rectangle can be dissected as described, transforming this rectangle proportionally would change these into a square without changing the nature (congruence and non-rectangularity) of the polygons filling it. Thus, if we can achieve this for a rectangle, it is just as feasible to do for a square by appropriately scaling the sides. # Conclusion Yes, there exists a rectangle that can be dissected into 15 congruent polygons which are not rectangles. By adjusting proportions while maintaining congruence, this solution extends to squares as well.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Characterize the Trapéz:** - Place (B') as the perpendicular projection of (B) onto (CD). - Given ( angle D = 45^circ), ( triangle DB'B) is an isosceles right triangle with (DB' = BB' = 100 , text{m}). - Hence, (B'C = 100 , text{m}) and (BC = 100sqrt{2} , text{m}). 2. **Trapezoid Decomposition:** - Express the trapezoid as a combination of a square (ADBB') with side (100 , text{m}) along with an attached right triangle (B'BC). 3. **Perimeter Calculation:** - Perimeter (P = AB + BC + CD + DA = 200 + 100sqrt{2} + 100 + 100 = 400 + 100sqrt{2} , text{m}). 4. **Guards' Path:** - The guards maintain a distance equal to exactly half of the perimeter along the edge of the trapezoid: [ d = frac{400 + 100sqrt{2}}{2} = 200 + 50sqrt{2} , text{m} ] 5. **Positioning & Movement:** - When one guard is at (F) (midpoint of (BC)), it's crucial to identify that the other will be at (D). - Calculate the straight-line distance (DF).

The length of the first train is 300 meters, and the length of the second train is 235 meters. So, the total distance to be covered for them to be clear of each other is: Total distance = Length of Train 1 + Length of Train 2 Total distance = 300 meters + 235 meters Total distance = 535 meters Now, we need to calculate the relative speed at which they are moving apart. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to get the relative speed. Speed of Train 1 = 120 km/h Speed of Train 2 = 90 km/h Relative speed = Speed of Train 1 + Speed of Train 2 Relative speed = 120 km/h + 90 km/h Relative speed = 210 km/h We need to convert this speed into meters per second to match the units of the distance we calculated earlier. 1 km/h = (1 km/h) * (1000 meters/1 km) * (1 hour/3600 seconds) 1 km/h = 1000/3600 meters/second 1 km/h = 5/18 meters/second Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 210 km/h * (5/18 meters/second per km/h) Relative speed = 210 * 5/18 meters/second Relative speed = 35 * 5 meters/second Relative speed = 175 meters/second Now we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to be completely clear of each other: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 535 meters / 175 meters/second Time = 3.057142857 seconds So, it will take approximately boxed{3.06} seconds for the two trains to be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"prompt":"What is the maximum area of a rectangle whose vertex coordinates satisfy the equation |y+1|left(y^{2}+2y+28right)+|x2|=9left(y^{2}+2y+4right) with sides parallel to the coordinate axes?","completion":"Given the equation: [ |y+1|left(y^{2}+2y+28right) + |x-2| = 9left(y^{2}+2y+4right) ] First, let's simplify the given equation.

We need these triangles to be colored such that for any three colors chosen from the n colors, there exists one triangle with its three edges colored with these three colors. 3. **Color Distribution and Parity Argument**: - For each color, there should be {C_{n-1}}^{2} pairings of the remaining n-1 vertices into triangles. This implies that each color should appear in exactly {C_{n-1}}^{2} triangles. - Each color should, therefore, appear on exactly frac{{C_{n}}^{2}}{n} = frac{n-1}{2} edges (since each triangle has three edges). 4. **Feasibility for Even n**: - When n is even, frac{n-1}{2} is not an integer, hence a valid coloring scheme does not exist. 5. **Constructive Proof for Odd n**: - For n = 2m + 1 (an odd number), we can construct a feasible coloring scheme.

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, [ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) geq frac{(a + b + c)^2}{3}. ] Given that ( a + b + c = 12 ), [ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) geq frac{12^2}{3} = 48. ] 6. Therefore, the minimum surface area ( S ) of the sphere is: [ S geq pi cdot 48 = 48 pi. ] 7. This minimum is achieved when ( a = b = c ).

The dot product overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = |overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{b}|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}. If the vectors are perpendicular, theta = 90^circ, thus cos(90^circ) = 0, and consequently, overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 0. Therefore, statement A is verified as correct. **For B:** We are given that overrightarrow{PC} = frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{PA} + frac{3}{4}overrightarrow{PB}. To analyze the collinearity of points A, B, and C, we transform the equation into a form that shows the relationship between vectors overrightarrow{AC} and overrightarrow{CB}. By manipulating the given equation, we get frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{PC} - frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{PA} = frac{3}{4}overrightarrow{PB} - frac{3}{4}overrightarrow{PC}, which simplifies to overrightarrow{AC} = 3overrightarrow{CB}. This relationship indicates that the vector overrightarrow{AC} is three times the vector overrightarrow{CB} in magnitude and direction, confirming that points A, B, and C are collinear. Thus, statement B is confirmed as correct. **For C:** We're given vectors overrightarrow{a} = (1, 1, x) and overrightarrow{b} = (-3, x, 9) and a condition x < frac{3}{10}. The angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} being obtuse implies overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} < 0. Calculating the dot product, if we find that for some x, this condition (dot product less than 0) holds, it suggests the angle is obtuse. However, the condition for x to fulfill this property without explicitly calculating the dot product here is given as x < frac{3}{10}. When vectors are parallel, the condition frac{1}{-3} = frac{1}{x} = frac{x}{9} leads to x = -3, which contradicts the given x < frac{3}{10}. This contradiction indicates a misunderstanding in the application of the conditions for parallelism and the angle's nature based on the dot product. Therefore, with x < frac{3}{10} and x neq -3, the conclusion about the obtuse angle cannot be directly verified as correct without more detailed calculation. Thus, statement C is misinterpreted and deemed incorrect based on the provided logic. **For D:** If {overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, overrightarrow{c}} forms a basis for space, it implies that overrightarrow{a}, overrightarrow{b}, and overrightarrow{c} are linearly independent and span the space. Adding overrightarrow{m} = overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{c} to the set, we substitute overrightarrow{c} with overrightarrow{m}, keeping the set's ability to span the space and maintaining linear independence.

This implies: [ x_1^{-1} * x_2 in operatorname{Ker}(varphi) implies varphi(x_1^{-1} * x_2) = e_H implies varphi(x_1) = varphi(x_2) ] Thus, psi is well-defined. 4. **psi is a group homomorphism:** Since operatorname{Ker}(varphi) is a normal subgroup, for x, y in G, we have: [ psi((x * operatorname{Ker}(varphi)) * (y * operatorname{Ker}(varphi))) = psi((x * y) * operatorname{Ker}(varphi)) ] Using the definition of psi, we get: [ psi((x * y) * operatorname{Ker}(varphi)) = varphi(x * y) = varphi(x) circledast varphi(y) = psi(x * operatorname{Ker}(varphi)) circledast psi(y * operatorname{Ker}(varphi)) ] Hence, psi is a homomorphism. 5. **Surjectivity of psi:** psi is surjective because for every h in operatorname{Im}(varphi), there exists some x in G such that varphi(x) = h. Thus, psi maps the coset x * operatorname{Ker}(varphi) to h. 6. **Injectivity of psi:** If psi(x * operatorname{Ker}(varphi)) = e_H, then varphi(x) = e_H, which means x in operatorname{Ker}(varphi). Hence, x * operatorname{Ker}(varphi) = operatorname{Ker}(varphi). Therefore, the kernel of psi is {operatorname{Ker}(varphi)}, showing that psi is injective. # Conclusion: Since psi is both injective and surjective, it is an isomorphism. Therefore, the groups G / operatorname{Ker}(varphi) and operatorname{Im}(varphi) are isomorphic.

First, let's account for the visits by the 7 people who visited exactly two stores each. Since each of these people visited two stores, they account for 7 * 2 = 14 visits. Now, we have accounted for 14 of the 21 visits, which leaves us with 21 - 14 = 7 visits unaccounted for. Since we know that 11 people went shopping and 7 of them have already been accounted for (those who visited two stores each), there are 11 - 7 = 4 people left who have not been accounted for. These 4 people are responsible for the remaining 7 visits. Since everyone visited at least one store, each of these 4 people must have visited at least one store. Now, let's distribute the remaining 7 visits among these 4 people. If we give each of these 4 people one visit, that accounts for 4 visits. This leaves us with 7 - 4 = 3 visits still to be distributed. To maximize the number of stores visited by any one person, we would give all the remaining visits to one person.

Therefore, the answers are: (I) The smallest positive period of f(x) is boxed{2pi}, and the interval where it is monotonically decreasing is boxed{left[2kpi + frac{pi}{3}, 2kpi + frac{4pi}{3}right]}, where k in mathbb{Z}.

We are given that the value of x is 5, and we need to find the value of N such that the following equation holds true: (47% of N - 36% of 1412) + 65 = x First, let's convert the percentages to decimals and write the equation: (0.47 * N - 0.36 * 1412) + 65 = 5 Now, let's calculate 36% of 1412: 0.36 * 1412 = 508.32 Substitute this value back into the equation: (0.47 * N - 508.32) + 65 = 5 Now, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms: 0.47 * N - 508.32 + 65 = 5 0.47 * N - 443.32 = 5 Next, we'll add 443.32 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with N: 0.47 * N = 5 + 443.32 0.47 * N = 448.32 Finally, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 0.47 to solve for N: N = 448.32 / 0.47 N = 953.87 (approximately) Therefore, the number N is approximately boxed{953.87} ."},{"prompt":"a village in Sri Lanka, a certain percentage of people died by bombardment, 15% of the remainder left the village on account of fear.

The number of people who died by bombardment is x% of P, which can be written as (x/100) * P. The number of people remaining after the bombardment is P - (x/100) * P. 15% of the remaining people left the village on account of fear, so the number of people who left is 15% of (P - (x/100) * P), which can be written as 0.15 * (P - (x/100) * P). The final population, after the bombardment and the departure of 15% of the survivors, is given by: P - (x/100) * P - 0.15 * (P - (x/100) * P) = 3294 We are given that the initial population P is 4079. Let's substitute this value into the equation and solve for x: 4079 - (x/100) * 4079 - 0.15 * (4079 - (x/100) * 4079) = 3294 Now, let's simplify the equation: 4079 - 0.01x * 4079 - 0.15 * (4079 - 0.01x * 4079) = 3294 4079 - 40.79x - 0.15 * (4079 - 40.79x) = 3294 4079 - 40.79x - 0.15 * 4079 + 0.15 * 40.79x = 3294 4079 - 40.79x - 611.85 + 6.1185x = 3294 Now, combine like terms: 4079 - 611.85 - 40.79x + 6.1185x = 3294 3467.15 - 34.6715x = 3294 Now, subtract 3467.15 from both sides: -34.6715x = 3294 - 3467.15 -34.6715x = -173.15 Now, divide both sides by -34.6715 to solve for x: x = -173.15 / -34.6715 x ≈ 4.99 Therefore, approximately boxed{4.99%} of the people died by bombardment."},{"prompt":"A number is supposed to be multiplied by 3, but instead, it is divided by 5.

The error occurred because the number was divided by 5 instead. To find the percentage of error, we can compare the result of the incorrect operation with the result of the correct operation. Let's assume the number is x. The correct result should have been: 3x The incorrect result was: x/5 The difference between the correct and incorrect result is: 3x - x/5 To find the percentage of error, we divide the difference by the correct result and multiply by 100: Percentage of error = [(3x - x/5) / 3x] * 100 Simplifying the expression inside the brackets: Percentage of error = [(15x/5 - x/5) / 3x] * 100 Percentage of error = [(14x/5) / 3x] * 100 Percentage of error = (14/15) * 100 Now, we know that the percentage of error is 93.33333333333333%, so we can set the above expression equal to this value: (14/15) * 100 = 93.33333333333333 Solving for x is not necessary because we are only asked for the correct operation, which we have already identified as multiplication by boxed{3} ."},{"prompt":"Solution Y is 20 percent liquid X and 80 percent water. If a certain amount of water evaporates from 8 kilograms of solution Y and the same amount of solution Y is added to the remaining liquid, the new solution is 25 percent liquid X.

This means there are 0.20 * 8 = 1.6 kilograms of liquid X in the solution. After E kilograms of water evaporate, we are left with 8 - E kilograms of solution. Since only water evaporates, the amount of liquid X remains the same, 1.6 kilograms. Now, we add back 8 kilograms of solution Y, which is 20% liquid X. This means we are adding 0.20 * 8 = 1.6 kilograms of liquid X and 0.80 * 8 = 6.4 kilograms of water. The new solution now has 1.6 (from the original solution) + 1.6 (from the added solution) = 3.2 kilograms of liquid X. The total weight of the new solution is (8 - E) + 8 = 16 - E kilograms. We are told that the new solution is 25% liquid X. Therefore, the weight of liquid X in the new solution should be 25% of the total weight of the new solution: 3.2 = 0.25 * (16 - E) To find E, we solve for E: 3.2 = 4 - 0.25E 0.25E = 4 - 3.2 0.25E = 0.8 E = 0.8 / 0.25 E = 3.2 kilograms So, boxed{3.2} kilograms of water evaporated."},{"prompt":"a pocket, there are 4 red balls and 8 white balls, which are identical except for color.

How many white balls were removed?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution: Part 1: Probability of Drawing a Black Ball Given that there are 4 red balls and 8 white balls in the pocket, the total number of balls is 4 + 8 = 12 balls. Since there are no black balls mentioned, the event of drawing a black ball is an impossible event. - **Probability of drawing a black ball** = frac{text{Number of black balls}}{text{Total number of balls}} = frac{0}{12} = 0. Therefore, the probability of drawing a black ball randomly from the pocket is boxed{0}. Part 2: Probability of Drawing a Red Ball Given the same set of balls, the probability of drawing a red ball can be calculated as follows: - **Probability of drawing a red ball** = frac{text{Number of red balls}}{text{Total number of balls}} = frac{4}{12} = frac{1}{3}. Thus, the probability of drawing a red ball randomly from the pocket is boxed{frac{1}{3}}. Part 3: Determining the Number of White Balls Removed Let's denote the number of white balls removed as x. After removing x white balls and adding x red balls, the new total of red balls becomes 4 + x and the total number of balls becomes 12 - x (since we removed x white balls and added the same number of red balls, the total number of balls remains the same). Given that the probability of drawing a red ball after this change is frac{5}{6}, we can set up the equation: - **New probability of drawing a red ball** = frac{4 + x}{12} = frac{5}{6}.
