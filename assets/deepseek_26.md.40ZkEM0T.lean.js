The possible numbers (two to five digits long) that can be formed are 2^2 - 2, 2^3 - 2, 2^4 - 2, and 2^5 - 2.

There are 2 ways to fill each segment (details of segment filling are combinatorially intensive and stem from valid coin placement patterns). 7. **Summarize Combinations**: - If the empty column were exactly one of the inner columns: (98 times 4 = 392) possibilities. - If the empty column is at the edge (first or very last column): (2 times 2 = 4) ways.

We can rewrite this as: [ (1-x)x = x - x^2 ] To find the maximum, we can complete the square: [ x - x^2 = -left(x^2 - xright) = -left(x^2 - x + frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{4}right) = -left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{1}{4} ] The maximum value occurs when left(x - frac{1}{2}right)^2 = 0, i.e., x = frac{1}{2}.

Denote the coordinates of the ends of the segment and the marked points as ( x_0, x_1, ldots, x_{n+1} ) such that ( x_0 = 0 ) and ( x_{n+1} = 1 ). This means our points are ordered as: [ 0 = x_0 < x_1 < ldots < x_{n+1} = 1 ] The problem's condition implies that each marked point ( x_i ) satisfies one of the conditions of the form: [ x_i = frac{1}{2}(a_i + b_i) quad text{for } i = 1, 2, ldots, n ] where each ( a_i ) and ( b_i ) is one of the numbers ( x_j ) for ( j = 0, 1, ldots, n+1 ), and we can assume ( a_i < x_i < b_i ). 2. Substitute the value of ( x_1 ) from the first equation into all other equations where ( x_1 ) appears on the right-hand side. This gives us a new set of equations (which have the same left-hand sides), but the right-hand sides no longer contain ( x_1 ). If the substitution leads to a term like ( alpha x_2 ) on the right side of the second equation, move it to the left side and divide both sides by ( 1 - alpha ) (later, we will show that ( alpha neq 1 )). The second equation now has the form: [ x_2 = beta_3 x_3 + beta_4 x_4 + ldots + beta_n x_n + beta_{n+1} ] where ( beta_i ) are some rational numbers. 3. Next, consider all the equations except the first and second. Substitute the value of ( x_2 ) from the second equation into all equations where ( x_2 ) appears on the right-hand side, then use the third equation to express ( x_3 ) in terms of ( x_4, ldots, x_n ). Repeat this process, ensuring that we never need to divide by zero at any stage. 4. By repeatedly applying these operations ( n ) times, we will end up with an equation for ( x_n ): [ x_n = gamma ] where ( gamma ) is a rational number. No unknowns are left on the right-hand side. At each step, the coefficients remain rational since we are only performing rational operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). 5. Continuing, we observe that: [ x_{n-1} ] is expressed as a rational combination of ( x_n ) and rational numbers, hence ( x_{n-1} ) is rational. Repeating this reasoning, we find that each ( x_i ) for ( i = n-1, n-2, ldots, 1 ) is rational. Therefore, all marked points are rational numbers. 6. Finally, we need to prove that at no step do we have division by zero. Every equation will have the form: [ x_i = delta_1 x_1 + delta_2 x_2 + ldots + delta_n x_n + delta_{n+1} ] where all coefficients ( delta_k ) are non-negative, and at least one coefficient ( delta_k ) with ( k > i ) is non-zero. Hence, when transferring a term ( delta_i x_i ) to the left side and dividing by ( 1 - delta_i ), all operations are valid, ensuring no division by zero.

After the third discount of 5%, the price becomes P * (1 - D1/100) * (1 - D2) * (1 - D3). We know that after all discounts, the price is Rs. 6500, so we can set up the equation: P * (1 - D1/100) * (1 - D2) * (1 - D3) = 6500 We know that D2 is 10%, so (1 - D2) = (1 - 0.10) = 0.90, and D3 is 5%, so (1 - D3) = (1 - 0.05) = 0.95.

Let's denote C for the circle's circumference, d for the diameter, r for the radius of the base of the cone, and l for the slant height (generatrix). Given the diameter d = 4, we can easily find the radius r = frac{d}{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2. Now, using the basic formula for the circumference of a circle, C = pi d = 2pi r, we have C = 2pi cdot 2 = 4pi. Next, we have to find the length of the arc in the sector that corresponds to this circumference when the cone is unfolded. This arc length will be the same as the circumference of the base of the cone, which is 4pi. The formula for the arc length in a circle is given by L = theta r, where L is the arc length and theta is the central angle in radians. To find the central angle in degrees, we need to convert radians to degrees using the relation 180^circ = pi radians. Thus, the central angle theta in degrees is theta^circ = frac{L}{r} cdot frac{180^circ}{pi}. Now using the values we've got, we find: theta^circ = frac{4pi}{2} cdot frac{180^circ}{pi} = 2 cdot 180^circ = 360^circ. However, this calculation presumes the circumference creates a full circle. For a cone, the base circumference forms a sector of a circle with a larger radius—the slant height (generatrix) of the cone (l = 6). Therefore, if the same length of arc 4pi is formed with a radius of l = 6 rather than r = 2, the angle will be smaller. Using the formula for the length of an arc L = theta l and solving for the angle theta in degrees, we get: theta^circ = frac{L}{l} cdot frac{180^circ}{pi} = frac{4pi}{6} cdot frac{180^circ}{pi} = frac{2}{3} cdot 180^circ = 120^circ.

Each class will get one group, and since there are 4 classes, this can be done in {A}_{4}^{4} ways. 3. **Calculate the Total Number of Ways**: Combining the two steps, we calculate the total number of ways to allocate the programs by multiplying the number of ways to group the programs by the number of ways to allocate these groups to classes. This gives us frac{{C}_{6}^{2}{C}_{4}^{2}}{{A}_{2}^{2}} times {A}_{4}^{4} ways. 4. **Simplify the Calculation**: - Calculate the combinations and permutations: - {C}_{6}^{2} = frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 - {C}_{4}^{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6 - {A}_{2}^{2} = 2! = 2 - {A}_{4}^{4} = 4! = 24 - Substitute these values into our formula: - frac{15 times 6}{2} times 24 = 45 times 24 = 1080 Therefore, the total number of different ways to allocate the programs is boxed{1080} ways.

We need to find non-negative integer solutions for y, z, w such that: [ 101y + 11z + 2w = 1002 ] Since 101y leq 1002, we have: [ y leq leftlfloor frac{1002}{101} rightrfloor = 9 ] Therefore, y can be 0, 1, 2, ldots, 9. However, we need to check which value of y satisfies the equation. 6. Trying y = 9: [ 101(9) + 11z + 2w = 1002 ] [ 909 + 11z + 2w = 1002 ] [ 11z + 2w = 93 ] 7.

The tangents to the parabola C at points A and B intersect at point M, and the abscissa of M is 4. Find the length of the chord |AB|=left( right) A: 16 B: 26 C: 14 D: 24","completion":"Given the focus F of the parabola C: x^{2}=-2pyleft(p > 0right) coincides with one of the foci of frac{y^2}{8}+frac{x^2}{4}=1, we start by identifying the focus F of the parabola C. The standard form of a parabola that opens downwards is x^2 = -4ay, where the focus is at (0, -a). Given that the focus F coincides with one of the foci of the ellipse and is given as F(0, -2), we can equate -a = -2 to find a = 2. Therefore, the value of p in the parabola's equation is 4, making the equation of the parabola C to be x^2 = -8y. Let's consider a line passing through the focus F and intersecting C at two distinct points A and B. We can represent the equation of this line as y = kx - 2. The points A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2) lie on both the line and the parabola, where y_1 = -frac{x_1^2}{8} and y_2 = -frac{x_2^2}{8}. The derivative of the parabola's equation, y = -frac{x^2}{8}, with respect to x gives us the slope of the tangent at any point on the parabola, which is y' = -frac{x}{4}. Therefore, the equations of the tangents at points A and B can be written as: - For point A: y - y_1 = -frac{x_1}{4}(x - x_1), simplifying to y = -frac{x_1}{4}x + frac{x_1^2}{8}, (1). - For point B: y - y_2 = -frac{x_2}{4}(x - x_2), simplifying to y = -frac{x_2}{4}x + frac{x_2^2}{8}, (2). Solving equations (1) and (2) for the point of intersection M, we find that the abscissa of M, x_M, is the average of x_1 and x_2, i.e., x_M = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}. Given that the abscissa of M is 4, we have frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 4, leading to x_1 + x_2 = 8. Substituting the equation of line AB, y = kx - 2, into the parabola's equation, we get x^2 + 8kx - 16 = 0. From this, we deduce that the sum of the roots, x_1 + x_2, is given by -8k = 8, which implies k = -1. Therefore, the sum of the ordinates of A and B, y_1 + y_2, is k(x_1 + x_2) - 4 = -1 times 8 - 4 = -12. Finally, the length of the chord |AB| can be found as |AB| = p - (y_1 + y_2) = 4 - (-12) = 16.

We need to prove that any line that does not pass through points ( A ), ( B ), or ( C ) either does not intersect any of the segments ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ), or intersects exactly two of these segments. We will proceed as follows: 1. **Define the half-planes determined by an external line** - Let ( l ) be a line that does not pass through points ( A ), ( B ), or ( C ). This line divides the plane into two half-planes. 2. **Consider positions of the points relative to the line ( l )** - There are two possible scenarios concerning the relative positions of points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) with respect to line ( l ): 1. All three points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) are on the same side of line ( l ). 2. Two points are on one side of line ( l ), and the third point is on the opposite side. 3. **Analyze the first scenario where all three points are on the same side of the line ( l )** - If ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) are all on the same side of line ( l ), then line ( l ) does not intersect any of the segments ( AB ), ( BC ), or ( CA ). Therefore, in this case, line ( l ) intersects zero segments. 4. **Analyze the second scenario where points are on different sides of line ( l )** - In this scenario, suppose without loss of generality that ( A ) and ( B ) are on one side of the line ( l ) and ( C ) is on the opposite side. Then line ( l ) must intersect the segments ( AC ) and ( BC ) but not the segment ( AB ). Therefore, line ( l ) intersects exactly two segments of the triangle. 5. **Conclusion: Summarize the findings** - From the analysis, we can conclude that any line ( l ) that does not pass through points ( A ), ( B ), or ( C ) must meet one of the two conditions: 1. It either does not intersect any of the segments ( AB ), ( BC ), or ( CA ). 2. It intersects exactly two of the segments of the triangle formed by ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given f(5^{2x1})=x2, find f(125).","completion":"First, we notice that 125 can be expressed as 5^3.

Since (a_1 - 1), (a_2 - 1), (a_3 - 1) are the first, second, and fifth terms of an arithmetic sequence, a_3 - 1 = (a_1 - 1) + 4[(a_2 - 1) - (a_1 - 1)], which simplifies to a_3 = -3a_1 + 4a_2.

We seek the term where x is to the zero power, which would make it the constant term. To find it, we set the power of x to zero: 5-2r = 0. Solving for r gives us r = frac{5}{2}, which is not an integer, therefore, it is not a valid term in this binomial expansion. Next, we look for a term where the power of x is -1, so that when multiplied by the (x+1) factor, the x terms will cancel out, leaving us with the constant term. Thus, we set 5-2r = -1. Solving for r, we get: 5-2r = -1 2r = 6 r = 3. Therefore, the term with x^{-1} in the expansion left(ax- frac{1}{x}right)^{5} is: T_{3+1} = (-1)^{3} a^{5-3} binom{5}{3} x^{-1}.

Similarly, the volume of water in the mixture is 5/11 of the total volume, so the volume of water is (5/11)V. The volume of other substances would be the remaining volume after subtracting the volumes of alcohol and water from the total volume. So, the volume of other substances is V - (3/8)V - (5/11)V. To find the ratio a:b:c, we need to express the volumes of alcohol, water, and other substances in terms of a common denominator. The common denominator for 8 and 11 is 88, so we will convert the fractions to have this common denominator. The volume of alcohol is (3/8)V = (3 * 11/11 * 8)V = (33/88)V. The volume of water is (5/11)V = (5 * 8/8 * 11)V = (40/88)V. Now, let's find the volume of other substances: V - (33/88)V - (40/88)V = (88/88)V - (33/88)V - (40/88)V = (88 - 33 - 40)/88 V = (15/88)V.

Let g(x) = x + 1 - 2ae^x, and find its derivative: g'(x) = 1 - 2ae^x. We consider two cases: (i) If a leq 0, then g'(x) > 0 for all x, implying that g(x) is strictly increasing on mathbb{R}.

When x < lnleft(frac{1}{2a}right), we have g'(x) > 0, indicating that g(x) is increasing on (-infty, lnleft(frac{1}{2a}right)). As x approaches -infty, g(x) becomes less than 0. When x > lnleft(frac{1}{2a}right), g'(x) < 0, implying that g(x) is decreasing on (lnleft(frac{1}{2a}right), +infty). As x approaches +infty, g(x) also becomes less than 0.

M does not contain any subset from the family Phi. 2. The number of elements in M is at least leftlfloor sqrt{2n} rightrfloor. Here, Phi is a family of 3-element subsets of X where any two subsets in Phi share at most one element. 1. **Existence of M:** - We initially observe that sets such as the 1-element and 2-element subsets of X do not intersect with any 3-element subset from Phi. Therefore, subsets not containing any element from Phi exist. 2. **Defining M:** - Let M be the largest subset of X such that M does not contain any subsets from Phi. This means M subset X, and for any x in X setminus M, there exists a subset B in Phi such that B subseteq M cup {x}. 3. Let |M| = r. Then |X setminus M| = n - r. 4. **Mapping elements ( x in X setminus M ) to pairs ({a, b}) with ( a, b in M )**: - Since M is maximal, for every x in X setminus M, there exists a subset A_x subseteq M with |A_x| = 2 such that {x} cup A_x in Phi. This implies that each x corresponds to a unique pair A_x = {a, b} subseteq M. 5. **Defining a mapping**: - Define a function f: X setminus M to H_2(M), where H_2(M) denotes the set of all 2-element subsets of M. 6. **Proving that f is injective**: - Assume x, y in X setminus M with x neq y. If A_x = A_y, then {x} cup A_x and {y} cup A_y would both be in Phi and contain the same pair A_x. This would mean these two 3-element sets in Phi share two elements, contradicting the property of Phi where any two subsets share at most one element. Hence, A_x neq A_y, and thus f(x) neq f(y). Therefore, f is injective. 7. **Estimating the sizes**: - Because f is injective, |X setminus M| leq |H_2(M)|. - Note that |H_2(M)| = frac{r(r-1)}{2} represents the number of 2-element subsets of M. - Thus: [ n - r leq frac{r(r-1)}{2} ] Simplifying, we get: [ r^2 + r - 2n geq 0 ] 8. **Finding the bound on (r)**: - Solving the quadratic inequality r^2 + r - 2n geq 0, the roots are: [ r geq frac{-1 + sqrt{8n + 1}}{2} ] - Define t = frac{sqrt{8n + 1} - 1}{2}, noting that t might not be an integer. We need: [ r geq leftlfloor frac{-1 + sqrt{8n + 1}}{2} rightrfloor + 1 ] 9. **Comparison**: - Given 2n = t^2 + t, we have: [ leftlfloor sqrt{2n} rightrfloor = leftlfloor sqrt{t(t+1)} rightrfloor ] - If t is an integer, leftlfloor sqrt{t(t+1)} rightrfloor = t. Hence, r geq leftlfloor sqrt{2n} rightrfloor. - When t is not an integer, we use leftlfloor t rightrfloor + 1 leq r, ensuring r geq leftlfloor sqrt{2n} rightrfloor. 10. **Conclusion**: - Combining these results, we conclude that the number of elements in M satisfies |M| geq leftlfloor sqrt{2n} rightrfloor.

Therefore, frac{a^2}{b} is larger than a. - **Case 2: a = b > c:** Then, a = b and we examine frac{b^2}{c} = frac{a^2}{c}: frac{a^2}{c} > a quad text{since} quad a = b > c implies a^2 > ac implies frac{a^2}{c} > a. Therefore, frac{a^2}{c} is larger than a. In either case, the maximum value from the set left{ a, b, c, frac{a^2}{b}, frac{b^2}{c}, frac{c^2}{a} right} is greater than the maximum value among a, b, and c. Similarly, we can examine that the minimum value in the set left{ a, b, c, frac{a^2}{b}, frac{b^2}{c}, frac{c^2}{a} right} is less than the minimum value among a, b, and c due to the form frac{x^2}{y} where x and y are different. 2. Thus, **If a, b, c are distinct numbers**, we have established at a minimum, four distinct numbers: a, b, c, maxleft(frac{a^2}{b}, frac{b^2}{c}, frac{c^2}{a}right) - Each of these terms must generate new distinct numbers due to their dependency on each other, and these cannot collapse to the same number. 3. **If a = b = c:** - In this specific case, each term frac{a^2}{b}, frac{b^2}{c}, frac{c^2}{a} would simplify to frac{a^2}{a} = a, making each number in the set the same: left{ a, a, a, a, a, a right} quad = quad {a}. - This results in all six numbers being identical. # Conclusion: Given the cases analyzed, it becomes evident that it is not possible for the set left{a, b, c, frac{a^{2}}{b}, frac{b^{2}}{c}, frac{c^{2}}{a}right} to consist of exactly three distinct numbers. The set will either have more than three distinct numbers or all numbers identical.

The total rental income in n years is 30n. The total renovation cost forms an arithmetic sequence with first term 1 and common difference 2. Thus, the total renovation cost in n years is n + frac{n(n-1)}{2} times 2 = n^2. Therefore, the profit y = 30n - (81 + n^2). Setting y > 0, we find that 3 < n < 27. Hence, the developer starts to make a net profit from the 4^{text{th}} year. 2. The profit function is y = 30n - (81 + n^2) = -(n - 15)^2 + 144. Thus, after 15 years, the total profit is 144 + 10 = boxed{154} (in 10,000 yuan). The average annual profit is W = frac{30n - (81 + n^2)}{n} = 30 - frac{81}{n} - n leqslant 30 - 2sqrt{81} = 12.

Notice that we have: - Each white square ( B ) can be reached from at most 2 white squares from the previous row, which we'll call ( B_1 ) and ( B_2 ). 3. **Recursive Formula**: - The number of paths reaching ( B ) is the sum of the paths reaching ( B_1 ) and ( B_2 ): [ text{count}(B) = text{count}(B_1) + text{count}(B_2) ] - If there is only one preceding white square ( B_1 ): [ text{count}(B) = text{count}(B_1) ] 4. **Base Case Initialization**: Start at the initial edge (let’s call it the start edge).

These observations result in a reduction of the interval count by 1 for each compared to our earlier estimate. Hence, we refine: [ 2k leq 2m + 2n - 2 ] Which simplifies to: [ k leq m + n - 1 ] Thus, the lemma is proved. 4. **Applying the Lemma to Solve the Problem**: Consider the 100 sets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{100} ), each being a union of exactly 100 non-overlapping intervals. To find the maximum number of intervals in ( A_1 cap A_2 cap cdots cap A_{100} ): 5. **Iterative Intersection Process**: We iteratively apply the lemma: - Start with ( A_1 ), having 100 intervals. - Intersect ( A_1 ) with ( A_2 ), making the intersection ( A_1 cap A_2 ) a union of at most ( 100 + 100 - 1 = 199 ) intervals. - Continue intersecting sequentially with each subsequent set ( A_3, A_4, ldots ), applying the lemma each step: [ 199 cap A_3 rightarrow 199 + 100 - 1 = 298 ] and so forth, until: [ 9802 + 100 - 1 = 9901 ] 6. **Conclusion**: The intersection ( A_1 cap A_2 cap cdots cap A_{100} ) can thus be expressed as a union of no more than 9901 non-overlapping intervals.

This subgraph is a complete directed graph ( K_4 ) with: [ binom{4}{2} = 6 ] directed edges. 5. **Existence of a Vertex with High Out-Degree in Subgraph**: Again, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one vertex in this subgraph with an out-degree of at least: [ leftlceil frac{6}{4} rightrceil = 2 ] Without loss of generality, assume this vertex is ( b ), and it has directed edges to at least two other vertices, say ( c ) and ( d ). 6. **Checking Directed Edges**: - If there is a directed edge ( overrightarrow{cd} ), then the ordered group ( (a, b, c, d) ) satisfies the condition ( a_i ) wins against ( a_j ) for any ( 1 leq i < j leq 4 ). - If the directed edge is ( overrightarrow{dc} ), then the ordered group ( (a, b, d, c) ) satisfies the condition.

Note that in the general situation, the crossratio of four conics can be assimilated to that of the four points of intersection with a fifth conic passing through three of the fixed points of the bundle.","completion":"Step 1: Transformation of the Conic Bundle to a Bundle of Circles 1. **Projection to Transform Conic Bundle:** - To transform the given bundle of conics into a bundle of circles, we need to perform an adequate projection. We will project so that two of the points of the conic bundle map onto the two cyclic points ((1 : i : 0)) and ((1 : -i : 0)). - Under this projection, all the conics in the bundle become circles passing through these two fixed points, which are the intersections of any circle in the bundle. Step 2: Concurrency of Polars 2. **Proving Concurrency of Polars Through Point (P):** - Let (P) be any point in the plane, and consider the polars (p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) of (P) with respect to four circles (Gamma_1, Gamma_2, Gamma_3, Gamma_4) with centers (O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4). - The radical axis of two circles is the locus of points with equal power with respect to both circles. Since the radical axes of any three circles from a bundle are concurrent, the point of concurrency is related to their radical center. - Fix a circle and vary the other. The radical axes of (P) with respect to each circle in the bundle are concurrent because they all pass through the same radical center. - Specifically, the radical axis of (P) and any circle passes through the midpoint of the tangents from (P) to the circle. Applying homothety centered at (P) with factor 2, this sends the radical axis to the polar (p_i) of (P) with respect to circle (Gamma_i). Step 3: Equality of Cross Ratios 3. **Perpendicularity and Equality of Cross Ratios:** - The polar of (P) with respect to (Gamma_i) is perpendicular to the line segment (PO_i). - Hence, the cross ratio of the polars (p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) is equal to the cross ratio of the lines (PO_1, PO_2, PO_3, PO_4). [ b_{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4} = b_{P O_1, P O_2, P O_3, P O_4} ] Step 4: Independence of Point (P) 4. **Projection on Symmetry Axis:** - By projecting onto the axis of symmetry of the bundle, we see that the cross ratio of lines from (P) to the centers of the circles is actually independent of (P). - Consequently, the cross ratio of the polars of (P) with respect to the circles is invariant for any point (P). - This invariance justifies the notation (b_{Gamma_1, Gamma_2, Gamma_3, Gamma_4} = b_{p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4}). [ b_{PO_1, PO_2, PO_3, PO_4} = b_{O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4} ] Step 5: Generalization to Four Conics 5. **General Case of Conic's Cross Ratio:** - Returning to the general setting, the cross ratio of four conics can be assimilated to the cross ratio of the four points of intersection with a fifth conic passing through three fixed points of the bundle. - Thus, the birapport (or cross ratio) of four conics refers to this cross ratio of four specific points, proving it’s a well-defined quantity.

Therefore, (k = 1), (5), and (6) are one-digit Anderson numbers. Of these, the only even Anderson number is (6). 2. Next, we examine two-digit Anderson numbers. Since any two-digit Anderson number (k) must end in 6 (based on one-digit Anderson numbers), we express (k) as (10c + 6). 3. We calculate (k^2) for the general form (k = 10c + 6): [ k^2 = (10c + 6)^2 = 100c^2 + 120c + 36. ] For (k) to be an Anderson number, the last two digits of (k^2) must be (c6).

So, (76) is the only even two-digit Anderson number. 5.

Therefore, (k = 376). Verification: [ 376^2 = 141376, ] which ends with 376, confirming (376) as an Anderson number. 7. For four-digit Anderson numbers, consider (k = 1000a + 376): [ k^2 = (1000a + 376)^2 = 1000000a^2 + 752000a + 141376. ] For (k) to be an Anderson number: [ 1000000a^2 + 752000a + 141376 equiv 1000a + 376 pmod{10000}. ] 8.

Can Jonathan reach a state where only three points remain on the circle, colored (clockwise): Blue, green, red?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Definitions:** - We start with a circle containing three points colored (clockwise): Green (G), Blue (B), and Red (R). - We define an **arc** as a pair of consecutive colors in the sequence. - We define the following types of arcs: GB (Green-Blue), BR (Blue-Red), and RG (Red-Green). 2. **Operations and Their Effects:** - **First Operation:** Choose two adjacent points with different colors and add a point between them with one of the two colors only. This operation does not change the sequence of arcs. - **Second Operation:** Choose two adjacent points with the same color and add a point between them with any of the three colors. This operation can change the sequence of arcs as follows: [ begin{aligned} &B rightarrow BRB, &B rightarrow BGB, &R rightarrow RBR, &R rightarrow RGR, &G rightarrow GRG, &G rightarrow GBG. end{aligned} ] - **Third Operation:** Choose three adjacent points, at least two of them having the same color, and delete the middle point. This operation can reverse the second operation: [ begin{aligned} &BRB rightarrow B, &BGB rightarrow B, &RBR rightarrow R, &RGR rightarrow R, &GRG rightarrow G, &GBG rightarrow G. end{aligned} ] 3. **Meaningful Operations:** - An operation is **meaningful** if it changes the sequence of arcs. - There are 12 possible meaningful operations: 6 additive (increasing the sequence by 2 letters) and 6 subtractive (decreasing the sequence by 2 letters). 4. **Tracking Arcs:** - Let a, b, and c be variables corresponding to the number of GB, BR, and RG arcs, respectively. - Each meaningful operation toggles the parity of precisely one of a, b, or c. 5. **Parity Analysis:** - Initially, the sequence is G, B, R, so a = 1, b = 1, and c = 1. Thus, a + b + c = 3 (odd). - The desired final state is B, G, R, so a = 1, b = 1, and c = 0. Thus, a + b + c = 2 (even). 6. **Conclusion:** - Since the number of additive and subtractive moves must be equal (to maintain the sequence length), the parities of a, b, and c must be toggled an even number of times in total. - This implies that a + b + c should have the same parity at the beginning and the end. - However, a + b + c changes from 3 (odd) to 2 (even), which is a contradiction. Therefore, Jonathan cannot reach the desired state. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A line segment of unit length moves along each of two skew edges of a cube. In which positions of the segments will the volume of the tetrahedron defined by their endpoints be maximized?","completion":"1. **Define the setup:** Consider a cube with edge length ( a ). Let ( AB ) and ( CD ) be two skew edges of the cube (where the vertices ( B ) and ( C ) are directly above each other). Let ( PQ ) be a segment of unit length on edge ( AB ), and ( XY ) be a segment of unit length on edge ( CD ). 2. **Analyze the plane and height:** By fixing ( XY ) and moving ( PQ ) along ( AB ), we can see the height of the triangle ( PQX ) as the distance between the line segment ( PQ ) and point ( X ). This distance is constant and equals the perpendicular distance between the line ( AB ) and the point ( X ) (due to point ( C ) directly above ( B )), which remains a constant value because of the symmetric properties of the cube. 3. **Evaluate the area of triangle ( PQX ):** Since the distance is constant and ( PQ ) has a fixed length, the area of triangle ( PQX ) remains constant. The triangle ( PQX ) lies within the plane formed by ( A, B, ) and ( X ). 4. **Determine the fixed volume of the tetrahedron:** As the base area of triangle ( PQX ) is constant, so is the height of tetrahedron ( PQXY ), since ( Y ) is moving along the perpendicular to the plane through point ( X ). Hence, the volume of tetrahedron remains constant no matter where ( PQ ) or ( XY ) move along their respective edges. 5. **Parameterize ( PQ ) and fix heights:** Those steps can be analogously made by fixing ( PQ ) and moving ( XY ), giving the same conclusion that the resulting tetrahedron will have the same volume property. 6. **Reconsider vertex positions for final adjustments:** If both segments ( PQ ) and ( XY ) are positioned such that point ( P ) coincides with point ( B ) and point ( X ) coincides with point ( C ), then the tetrahedron ( PQXY ) will have a consistent configuration. 7. **Conclusively compute the volume:** The base area of triangle ( PQX ) when ( P ) coincides with ( B ) and ( X ) coincides with ( C ) is [ text{Area}_{PQX} = frac{a}{2}. ] The height of tetrahedron ( PQXY ) is the length of segment ( XY ), which equals 1. 8. **Final volume calculation:** The volume ( V ) of tetrahedron is [ V = frac{1}{3} times text{base area} times text{height} = frac{1}{3} times frac{a}{2} times 1 = frac{a}{6}. ] Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{a}{6}} ]"},{"prompt":"Joe now eats four meals a day instead of three.

Show that this requirement defines a topology that is regular but not normal. *A. Csaszar*","completion":"1. **Define the topology:** The open sets in this topology are those Lebesgue-measurable sets which have density 1 at all their points. Specifically, a set ( U ) is open if for every ( x in U ), the density of ( U ) at ( x ) is 1. The density of a set ( E ) at a point ( x ) is defined as: [ lim_{r to 0} frac{lambda(E cap (x-r, x+r))}{2r} = 1, ] where ( lambda ) denotes the Lebesgue measure. 2. **Regularity:** To show that the topology is regular, we need to show that for any closed set ( F ) and a point ( x notin F ), there exist disjoint open sets containing ( F ) and ( x ). Let ( F ) be a closed set in this topology and ( x notin F ). Without loss of generality, assume ( x = 0 ). Since ( F ) is closed, its complement ( mathbb{R} setminus F ) is open and has density 1 at all its points, including 0. Construct a sequence ( (x_n) ) of positive reals converging to 0 such that the measure of ( F cap (-t, t) ) is at most ( frac{1}{n} ) times the measure of ( (-t, t) ) for all ( 0 < t leq x_n ). This is possible because ( mathbb{R} setminus F ) has density 1 around 0. Also, assume ( 2x_{n+1} < x_n ) for all ( n ). Define ( D_n ) as an open set covering ( F cap ((-x_n, x_n) setminus (-x_{n+1}, x_{n+1})) ) with measure ( leq frac{2}{n} ) times the measure of ( (-x_n, x_n) setminus (-x_{n+1}, x_{n+1}) ). The union ( D = bigcup_{n} D_n ) is an open set containing ( F ) but not 0. Its complement ( U ) has density 1 at 0. By the Lebesgue Density Theorem, we can eliminate a set of measure zero from ( U ) so that the remainder has density 1 at all its points. Thus, we have disjoint open sets containing ( x ) and ( F ). 3. **Non-normality:** To show that the topology is not normal, we need to find two disjoint closed sets that cannot be separated by disjoint open sets. Let ( A ) and ( B ) be disjoint dense ( G_delta ) sets of measure zero. Such sets can be constructed using standard techniques in measure theory. ( A ) and ( B ) are disjoint closed sets in our topology. Assume, for contradiction, that there exist disjoint open sets ( U supset A ) and ( V supset B ). For each positive integer ( n ), let ( A_n ) (resp. ( B_n )) be the subset of ( A ) (resp. ( B )) consisting of those points ( x ) with the property that the measure of ( (x-t, x+t) cap U ) (resp. ( (x-t, x+t) cap V )) is at least ( frac{2}{3} ) times the measure of ( (-t, t) ) for all ( 0 < t leq frac{1}{n} ). ( A_n ) and ( B_n ) are closed subsets of ( A ) and ( B ), respectively, and ( A = bigcup A_n ) and ( B = bigcup B_n ). By Baire's Theorem, since ( A ) and ( B ) are ( G_delta ) sets in a Polish space, we can find an ( n ) and an interval of the real line in which both ( A_n ) and ( B_n ) are dense. This leads to a contradiction because we would find two intervals of length ( frac{2}{n} ), arbitrarily close, such that ( U ) has density ( geq frac{2}{3} ) in one of them, while ( V ), which is disjoint from ( U ), has density ( geq frac{2}{3} ) in the other one.

Given f(x)=frac{1}{{12}}{x^4}-frac{m}{6}{x^3}-frac{3}{2}{x^2}, First derivative: {f'}(x)=frac{1}{3}{x^3}-frac{m}{2}{x^2}-3x, Second derivative: f''left(xright)=x^{2}-mx-3. Step 2: Apply the condition for f(x) to be a convex function. For f(x) to be a convex function on (1,3), f''left(xright) < 0 for all x in (1,3). Therefore, x^{2}-mx-3 < 0 for all x in (1,3). Step 3: Solve the inequality for m. From x^{2}-mx-3 < 0, we get m > frac{x^2-3}{x} = x - frac{3}{x}. Let g(x) = x - frac{3}{x}. Step 4: Analyze the function g(x). Finding the derivative of g(x), we get {g'}(x) = 1 + frac{3}{x^2} > 0 for all x in (1,3). This implies that g(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (1,3). Step 5: Determine the minimum value of m. Since g(x) is monotonically increasing, the minimum value of m that satisfies the condition is when x = 3. Thus, g(3) = 3 - frac{3}{3} = 2. Therefore, for all x in (1,3), m > g(x) geq g(3) = 2. Conclusion: The range of real number m for which f(x) is a convex function on the interval (1,3) is m geq 2.

What is the average wage per day paid by the contractor?","completion":"To calculate the average wage per day paid by the contractor, we need to find the total amount paid to all workers and then divide it by the total number of workers. First, let's calculate the total amount paid to each group of workers: Male workers: 20 males * Rs. 25/day = Rs. 500/day Female workers: 15 females * Rs. 20/day = Rs. 300/day Child workers: 5 children * Rs. 8/day = Rs. 40/day Now, let's find the total amount paid to all workers: Total amount paid = Rs. 500/day (male) + Rs. 300/day (female) + Rs. 40/day (child) Total amount paid = Rs. 840/day Next, we find the total number of workers: Total number of workers = 20 males + 15 females + 5 children Total number of workers = 40 workers Finally, we calculate the average wage per day: Average wage per day = Total amount paid / Total number of workers Average wage per day = Rs. 840/day / 40 workers Average wage per day = Rs. 21/day Therefore, the average wage per day paid by the contractor is Rs. boxed{21} ."},{"prompt":"Find, with proof, all nonconstant polynomials P(x) with real coefficients such that, for all nonzero real numbers z with P(z)neq 0 and P(frac{1}{z}) neq 0 we have frac{1}{P(z)}+frac{1}{P(frac{1} {z})}=z+frac{1}{z}.","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Simplification:** Given the equation: [ frac{1}{P(z)} + frac{1}{Pleft(frac{1}{z}right)} = z + frac{1}{z} ] for all nonzero real numbers ( z ) such that ( P(z) neq 0 ) and ( Pleft(frac{1}{z}right) neq 0 ). 2. **Substitution and Simplification:** Let's substitute ( z = 1 ) and ( z = -1 ) into the equation: [ frac{1}{P(1)} + frac{1}{P(1)} = 1 + 1 implies frac{2}{P(1)} = 2 implies P(1) = 1 ] [ frac{1}{P(-1)} + frac{1}{P(-1)} = -1 + (-1) implies frac{2}{P(-1)} = -2 implies P(-1) = -1 ] Thus, ( P(1) = 1 ) and ( P(-1) = -1 ). 3. **General Form of ( P(z) ):** Suppose ( P(z) = C prod_{i=1}^{n} (z - u_i) ) for some constant ( C neq 0 ). Then the given equation becomes: [ frac{P(z) + Pleft(frac{1}{z}right)}{P(z) Pleft(frac{1}{z}right)} = z + frac{1}{z} ] Cross-multiplying, we get: [ P(z) Pleft(frac{1}{z}right) left( z + frac{1}{z} right) = P(z) + Pleft(frac{1}{z}right) ] 4. **Degree Analysis:** Let's analyze the degrees of both sides. The left-hand side (LHS) has degree ( 2n + 1 ) since ( P(z) ) and ( Pleft(frac{1}{z}right) ) are both polynomials of degree ( n ). The right-hand side (RHS) has degree ( n + 2 ) plus the number of nonzero roots of ( P ). 5. **Root Analysis:** Plugging ( z = u_j ) for some ( j ) into the equation, we get: [ P(u_j) Pleft(frac{1}{u_j}right) left( u_j + frac{1}{u_j} right) = P(u_j) + Pleft(frac{1}{u_j}right) ] Since ( P(u_j) = 0 ), the RHS is zero, implying that ( u_j ) must pair with some ( u_k ) such that ( u_j u_k = 1 ). 6. **Multiplicity Analysis:** For some ( u_i = w ), let the multiplicity of ( w ) in ( P ) be ( a ) and the multiplicity of ( frac{1}{w} ) in ( P ) be ( b ). We need to show ( a = b ). Assume ( a < b ). Taking the derivative of both sides, the multiplicity of ( w ) in the derivative of the RHS is ( a + b - 1 ) or ( a + b ) if ( w = pm i ). The multiplicity of ( w ) in the derivative of the LHS is ( a - 1 ) for the first addend and ( b - 1 ) for the second addend. Since they are not equal, ( a = b ) must hold. 7. **Form of ( P(z) ):** We have shown that ( P(z) ) can be written as ( zQ(z) ) for some polynomial ( Q(z) ) such that ( Q(z) = Qleft(frac{1}{z}right) ). Plugging this into the original equation: [ frac{1}{zQ(z)} + frac{z}{Qleft(frac{1}{z}right)} = left( z + frac{1}{z} right) frac{1}{Q(z)} = z + frac{1}{z} ] This implies ( Q(z) = 1 ) for all ( z ). 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the only solution to the problem is: [ boxed{P(z) = z} ]"},{"prompt":"Carrie and her mom go to the mall to buy new clothes for school.

The total cost of the jackets is ( 2 times 60 = 120 ). The total cost of the pants is ( P times 18 ). So, the total cost of all the clothes is ( 32 + 120 + 18P ).

The slope of ON is 3, so the slope of line l is - frac {1}{3}, and the equation of l is y=- frac {1}{3}x+ frac {8}{3}. Now, |OM|=|OP|=2 sqrt {2}, and the distance from O to line l is frac {4 sqrt {10}}{5}, so |PM|= frac {4 sqrt {10}}{5}, and the area of triangle POM is boxed{frac {16}{5}}.

Calculation of probabilities of selecting each type of ball from box A: - For A_1: Since there are 4 red balls out of a total of 9 balls, P(A_1) = frac{4}{9} - For A_2: Since there are 2 white balls out of a total of 9 balls, P(A_2) = frac{2}{9} - For A_3: Since there are 3 black balls out of a total of 9 balls, P(A_3) = frac{3}{9} 2. Calculation of conditional probabilities P(B|A_i) for i=1,2,3: - If A_1 occurs first (a red ball is taken from box A and placed into box B), box B will then contain 4 red balls, 3 white balls, and 3 black balls, making a total of 10 balls.

Let x be any real number, then it can be expressed as: [ x = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + alpha, quad text{where } 0 leq alpha < 1. ] 2. Similarly, let y be any real number, then it can be expressed as: [ y = leftlfloor y rightrfloor + beta, quad text{where } 0 leq beta < 1. ] 3. Adding these two expressions, we have: [ x + y = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + alpha + leftlfloor y rightrfloor + beta = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + leftlfloor y rightrfloor + (alpha + beta). ] 4. Since 0 leq alpha < 1 and 0 leq beta < 1, we know: [ 0 leq alpha + beta < 2. ] 5. If alpha + beta < 1, then leftlfloor x+y rightrfloor = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + leftlfloor y rightrfloor. If alpha + beta geq 1, then leftlfloor x+y rightrfloor = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + leftlfloor y rightrfloor + 1. 6. Hence, in both cases, we have: [ leftlfloor x+y rightrfloor geq leftlfloor x rightrfloor + leftlfloor y rightrfloor. ] 2. leftlfloor frac{leftlfloor x rightrfloor}{n} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{x}{n} rightrfloor, where n is an integer. # First Solution: 1. Let x = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + alpha where 0 leq alpha < 1. 2. Denote leftlfloor x rightrfloor = qn + r where 0 leq r < n (i.e., q is the quotient and r is the remainder when dividing leftlfloor x rightrfloor by n). 3. So: [ frac{leftlfloor x rightrfloor}{n} = q + frac{r}{n}. ] 4. Therefore: [ leftlfloor frac{leftlfloor x rightrfloor}{n} rightrfloor = q. ] 5. Now express x as: [ x = qn + r + alpha. ] 6. So: [ frac{x}{n} = q + frac{r+alpha}{n}. ] 7. Since 0 leq r + alpha < n, it follows that: [ 0 leq frac{r + alpha}{n} < 1. ] 8. Thus: [ leftlfloor frac{x}{n} rightrfloor = q = leftlfloor frac{leftlfloor x rightrfloor}{n} rightrfloor. ] # Second Solution: 1. Consider all integers up to leftlfloor x rightrfloor that are divisible by n. The number of such integers is: [ leftlfloor frac{leftlfloor x rightrfloor}{n} rightrfloor. ] 2. Next, consider all integers up to x that are divisible by n. The number of these integers is: [ leftlfloor frac{x}{n} rightrfloor. ] 3. Since adding alpha does not introduce any new multiples of n, we conclude that: [ leftlfloor frac{leftlfloor x rightrfloor}{n} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{x}{n} rightrfloor. ] 3. leftlfloor x + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor - leftlfloor x rightrfloor 1. Consider the case when x - leftlfloor x rightrfloor < frac{1}{2}. Then: [ leftlfloor x + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor x rightrfloor. ] 2. Also: [ leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor = 2leftlfloor x rightrfloor. ] 3. Thus: [ leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor - leftlfloor x rightrfloor = 2leftlfloor x rightrfloor - leftlfloor x rightrfloor = leftlfloor x rightrfloor. ] 4. Now consider the case when x - leftlfloor x rightrfloor geq frac{1}{2}. Then: [ leftlfloor x + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + 1. ] 5. Also, since 2(x - leftlfloor x rightrfloor) geq 1, we have: [ leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor = 2leftlfloor x rightrfloor + 1. ] 6. Thus: [ leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor - leftlfloor x rightrfloor = 2leftlfloor x rightrfloor + 1 - leftlfloor x rightrfloor = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + 1. ] 7. Combining both cases, we have shown that: [ leftlfloor x + frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 2x rightrfloor - leftlfloor x rightrfloor. ] 4. (leftlfloor x rightrfloor + leftlfloor x + frac{1}{n} rightrfloor + leftlfloor x + frac{2}{n} rightrfloor + ldots + leftlfloor x + frac{n-1}{n} rightrfloor = leftlfloor nx rightrfloor) # First Solution: 1. Let x = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + alpha, where 0 leq alpha < 1. 2. The fraction alpha lies between two successive fractions of the form frac{0}{n}, frac{1}{n}, ldots, frac{n-1}{n}. 3. Suppose frac{k}{n} leq alpha < frac{k+1}{n}, then: [ alpha + frac{n - k - 1}{n} < 1, ] [ alpha + frac{n - k}{n} geq 1. ] 4. Hence: [ x + frac{n - k - 1}{n} = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + alpha + frac{n - k - 1}{n} < leftlfloor x rightrfloor + 1, ] [ x + frac{n - k}{n} = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + alpha + frac{n - k}{n} geq leftlfloor x rightrfloor + 1. ] 5. Therefore: [ leftlfloor x + frac{1}{n} rightrfloor, leftlfloor x + frac{2}{n} rightrfloor, ldots, leftlfloor x + frac{n - k - 1}{n} rightrfloor = leftlfloor x rightrfloor, ] [ leftlfloor x + frac{n - k}{n} rightrfloor, leftlfloor x + frac{n - k + 1}{n} rightrfloor, ldots, leftlfloor x + frac{n-1}{n} rightrfloor = leftlfloor x rightrfloor + 1. ] 6. There are n - k terms equal leftlfloor x rightrfloor and k terms equal leftlfloor x rightrfloor + 1. Adding these terms, we get: [ (n - k)leftlfloor x rightrfloor + k(leftlfloor x rightrfloor + 1) = nleftlfloor x rightrfloor + k. ] 7. Since nalpha = k + beta where 0 leq beta < 1, we have: [ leftlfloor nx rightrfloor = leftlfloor nleft(leftlfloor x rightrfloor + alpharight)rightrfloor = nleftlfloor x rightrfloor + k. ] 8. Therefore: [ leftlfloor x rightrfloor + leftlfloor x + frac{1}{n} rightrfloor + leftlfloor x + frac{2}{n} rightrfloor + ldots + leftlfloor x + frac{n-1}{n} rightrfloor = leftlfloor nx rightrfloor. ] # Second Solution: 1. Consider the case 0 leq x < frac{1}{n}. Then all terms x, x+frac{1}{n}, ldots, x+frac{n-1}{n} are less than 1, so: [ leftlfloor x rightrfloor = leftlfloor nx rightrfloor = 0. ] 2. Now for any arbitrary x, increasing x by frac{1}{n} shifts all terms in the sum one place to the right, and the last term leftlfloor x + frac{n-1}{n} rightrfloor becomes leftlfloor x + 1 rightrfloor which is leftlfloor x rightrfloor + 1. 3. Therefore, each such increment increases both the left-hand side and the right-hand side by 1. 4. For any x, we can find a number alpha such that 0 leq alpha < frac{1}{n} and x + alpha = frac{m}{n} for some integer m. 5. Hence the equality remains preserved for any x.

We must ensure no side has more than one match. Let's break down the solution step-by-step. 1. **Understand the Configuration**: We begin with the knowledge that we have 16 squares arranged in a 4x4 grid. These squares are surrounded by 16 matches, forming a boundary. Our task is to place 11 matches within this larger square grid. 2. **Initial Placement Strategy**: Surround the outer layer of this grid by placing matches strategically. Given the symmetry and requirements, we must distribute the matches to ensure an odd number in configuration. The idea is to create internal and external boundaries while adhering to the required count. 3. **Creating the First Layer**: Place six matches to form the outer boundary in such a way that the four outer squares are divided. Here's an illustration: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} hline _ & _ & _ & _ hline | & & & | hline | & & & | hline | & & & | hline _ & _ & _ & _ hline end{array} ] Here, each underscore (_) and vertical bar (|) represents a match. 4. **Intermediate Steps**: Follow-up by placing five more matches in the interior to isolate group four clusters of four squares. Consider clusters of four within the larger square, ensuring the distribution results in the ( 4 × 4 ) arrangement splitting as prescribed. 5. **Finalizing the Configuration**: Use a symmetrical approach to add the final set of matches. Place them to optimally surround the nested squares, ensuring four groups of four squares each maintain an odd number of total matches. 6. **Conclusion**: Once your placement successfully isolates the required clusters, recount the matches to verify they total to 11. The final configuration should visually confirm the division requested in the problem statement. Here's the satisfying 11 matches placed, delivering the intended setup: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|} hline - & - & - & | hline | & - & - & hline | & | & | & hline _ & _ & _ & | hline _ & _ & _ & _ hline end{array} ] Thus, we conclude our placement.

We can rewrite this equation as x^{3}+x-4=0 to make it easier to analyze. Let's define a function f(x) based on this equation: [f(x) = x^{3} + x - 4] Next, we need to determine the behavior of this function to understand where its roots might lie. To do this, we calculate the derivative of f(x): [f'(x) = 3x^{2} + 1] Since 3x^{2} + 1 > 0 for all real numbers x, this tells us that the derivative f'(x) is always positive. This implies that the function f(x) is monotonically increasing throughout its domain. In other words, as x increases, f(x) also increases. This is crucial because it means that if f(x) has a root (a value of x for which f(x) = 0), there can only be one such root. The function cannot decrease after increasing, so it cannot cross the x-axis more than once. To find the interval within which this root lies, we evaluate f(x) at specific points. We start by checking the value of f(x) at x=1: [f(1) = 1^{3} + 1 - 4 = -2] This calculation shows that f(1) < 0. Next, we evaluate f(x) at x=frac{3}{2}: [fleft(frac{3}{2}right) = left(frac{3}{2}right)^{3} + frac{3}{2} - 4 = frac{27}{8} + frac{3}{2} - 4 = frac{7}{8}] This result shows that fleft(frac{3}{2}right) > 0. Since f(x) is monotonically increasing and we have found that f(1) < 0 and fleft(frac{3}{2}right) > 0, the function must cross the x-axis (i.e., f(x) = 0) somewhere in the interval (1, frac{3}{2}). This means that the root of the equation x^{3} + x - 4 = 0 lies in this interval. Given that the interval is (1, frac{3}{2}) and we are looking for a value of k that is a multiple of frac{1}{2} and satisfies the condition that the root lies in the interval (k, k+frac{1}{2}), we can conclude that k=1.

The number of sets of 4 coplanar points is equal to the number of faces in a cube multiplied by the number of ways to choose 4 vertices from a single face.

The volume of the cone is V = frac{1}{3}pi R^{2}h = frac{1}{3}pi times 4^{2} times 3 = 16pi. Let the height of the molded cylinder be h' and the base radius be r. Since the clay volume remains constant, we can write: pi r^{2}h' = 16pi Rightarrow h' = frac{16pi}{pi r^{2}} = frac{16}{r^{2}}.

Part (a): Proving ( mathrm{P} geq frac{sqrt{2 sqrt{3} Delta}}{4} ) 1. Let's denote the circumradius of the tetrahedron (ABCD) by (R). 2. Utilizing the relationship involving the circumradius (R) and the facet areas (denoted as (Delta)), and recognizing that the centroid (M) of the tetrahedron coincides with the center (O) of the circumcircle of each face, we have: [ R^2_{A} + R^2_{B} + R^2_{C} + R^2_{D} = OA^2 + OB^2 + OC^2 + OD^2 = 4mathrm{P}^2 ] 3. For an equilateral tetrahedron, this relationship becomes: [ 4mathrm{P}^2 = frac{sqrt{3}Delta}{2} ] 4. Solving for (mathrm{P}), we get: [ mathrm{P}^2 = frac{sqrt{3}Delta}{8} ] 5. Taking the square root of both sides: [ mathrm{P} = sqrt{frac{sqrt{3}Delta}{8}} ] 6. We then simplify this expression to match the given form: [ mathrm{P} geq frac{sqrt{2 sqrt{3} Delta}}{4} ] Hence, the inequality in part (a) is proven and holds for all tetrahedra. The equality holds if the tetrahedron is regular. Part (b): Proving ( mathrm{P} geq frac{sqrt{6} Pi}{12} ) 1. We'll start with the volume (Pi) of the tetrahedron and the circumradius (R). 2. Using known results for regular tetrahedra: [ 4mathrm{P}^2 = frac{1}{6} Pi ] 3.

Given ( p ) is a prime number, the divisors of ( p ) are 1 and ( p ) itself.

We start by analyzing equation ( I ): y = x - 2 This equation represents a straight line with slope (1) and y-intercept (-2). 2. Next, let's analyze equation ( II ): y = frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 2} To simplify this, we perform polynomial division: [ frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 2} = frac{(x - 2)(x + 2)}{x + 2} ] When ( x neq -2 ), the expression simplifies to: [ y = x - 2 ] However, because of the division by ( x + 2 ), ( x = -2 ) is not in the domain of this function. Therefore, equation ( II ) represents a line ( y = x - 2 ) with a hole (removal) at the point ( (-2, -4) ). 3. Now, consider equation ( III ): (x + 2)y = x^2 - 4 Divide both sides by ( x + 2 ): [ y = frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 2} ] We notice this is the same equation as ( II ). So, for ( x neq -2 ): [ y = frac{x^2 - 4}{x + 2} = x - 2 ] But we also include the entire solution set without division. Thus, equation ( III ) includes both the line ( y = x - 2 ) for ( x neq -2 ) and the line ( x = -2 ) where ( y ) is undefined (vertical asymptote). # Conclusion: The graphical representations of the equations are different: - Equation ( I ): A straight line ( y = x - 2 ). - Equation ( II ): A straight line ( y = x - 2 ) with a hole at ( (-2, -4) ). - Equation ( III ): Combination of line ( y = x - 2 ) and line ( x = -2 ).

To show that the described procedure correctly determines the ellipse axes, we first consider Rytz's standard construction. This method uses a pair of conjugate semi-diameters to find the axis directions and lengths, which is theoretically proven valid. 2. We begin by rotating point D around point O by 90^{circ}. This results in a new point P. - Denote the midpoint of segment PC by Q. - The circle with center Q and radius QO intersects CP at points R and S. - According to Rytz's method, the axis directions of the ellipse are given by the lines OR and OS, with half-axis lengths of PR(=CS) and PS(=CR). 3. By examining the steps of both procedures in parallel: - OCFP and OECQ form parallelograms, ensuring Q is the midpoint of the diagonal OF, and OE parallel CP. - Utilizing the isosceles triangle property of triangle OQR: [ angle FOR = angle QOR = angle QRO = angle EOR, ] confirming that OR corresponds to one bisector of the angle formed by OE and OF. 4. OS (the perpendicular to OR by Thales' theorem) bisects the other angle between OE and OF. If OE > OF: [ GH = frac{GE}{2} = frac{OE - OG}{2} = frac{CP - OF}{2} = CQ - OQ = CQ - RQ = CR, ] [ OH = OG + GH = OF + CR = RS + CR = CS. ] 5.

First Conclusion: [ boxed{} ] Second Solution: 1. From textbook knowledge, the parametric equations for a quarter ellipse segment defined by semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b are x = a cos alpha, and y = b sin alpha. 2.

Given conjugate semi-diameters OC and OD, the endpoints correspond to parameters differing by 90^{circ}. The half-circle tangent lines at these points are parallel: Point C(a cos t, b sin t) and Point D(-a sin t, b cos t), due to properties cos (t+90^{circ}) = -sin t, and sin(t+90^{circ}) = cos t. 4.

It is known that if any one spotlight is turned off, the arena will still be fully illuminated, but if any two spotlights are turned off, the arena will not be fully illuminated. For which ( n ) is this possible?","completion":": 1. We begin by noting that each projector illuminates a convex shape on the arena. 2. The problem states: - If any one projector is turned off, the arena remains fully illuminated. - If any two projectors are turned off, the arena is no longer fully illuminated. 3. To solve this, we need to understand the relationship between the projectors and the areas they illuminate. First, let's consider every possible pair of projectors. Since there are n projectors, the total number of different pairs of projectors is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] This number represents the number of different ways we can choose 2 out of n projectors. 4. Let's place a regular k-gon (polygon with k equally spaced vertices) in the center of the arena, where k = frac{n(n-1)}{2}, representing the total number of pairwise combinations of the n projectors. 5. Each side of this k-gon can be seen as corresponding to one specific pair of projectors. Thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the segments (sides) of the k-gon and the pairs of projectors. 6. Now, assign each projector to illuminate the entire arena and additionally ensure that each projector illuminates the regions (segments of the k-gon) corresponding to the pairs it includes. This setup ensures that: 7. If we switch off any one projector, its corresponding segments (sides of the k-gon) will still be illuminated by other projectors, since each segment is illuminated by exactly two projectors (one from each pair). 8. On the other hand, if we switch off any two projectors, there will be unique segments (sides of the k-gon) that will no longer be illuminated, as those segments correspond uniquely to those two projectors. This configuration implies that the arena will be fully illuminated if and only if all but one projector are working. Furthermore, the arena will not be fully illuminated if precisely two projectors are turned off, satisfying the given conditions. # Conclusion: Thus, such a setup is possible for any n geq 2.

We are given that the man swims 54 km downstream in 3 hours, so we can write the equation for downstream: [ (v_m + v_s) times 3 = 54 ] [ v_m + v_s = frac{54}{3} ] [ v_m + v_s = 18 ] (Equation 1) Similarly, we are given that the man swims 18 km upstream in 3 hours, so we can write the equation for upstream: [ (v_m - v_s) times 3 = 18 ] [ v_m - v_s = frac{18}{3} ] [ v_m - v_s = 6 ] (Equation 2) Now we have two equations with two unknowns. We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of ( v_m ) (the speed of the man in still water). Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2: [ (v_m + v_s) + (v_m - v_s) = 18 + 6 ] [ 2v_m = 24 ] [ v_m = frac{24}{2} ] [ v_m = 12 ] So, the speed of the man in still water is boxed{12} km/h."},{"prompt":"Let (x_1,x_2,dots,x_{100}) be a permutation of (1,2,...,100) .

To find the median of any triplet {x_i, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}}, we need to sort the triplet and pick the middle value.

Since each person paid 25.48 and there were 6 people, we can calculate the total amount paid as follows: Total amount paid = 25.48 per person * 6 people Total amount paid = 152.88 Now we know the total amount paid by the group was 152.88, which includes the original dining bill of 139.00 plus the tip. To find the amount of the tip, we subtract the original bill from the total amount paid: Tip amount = Total amount paid - Original dining bill Tip amount = 152.88 - 139.00 Tip amount = 13.88 Now we have the tip amount of 13.88. To find the percentage of the tip, we divide the tip amount by the original dining bill and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: Tip percentage = (Tip amount / Original dining bill) * 100 Tip percentage = (13.88 / 139.00) * 100 Tip percentage ≈ 9.99% Therefore, the percentage of the tip they added was approximately boxed{9.99%} ."},{"prompt":"a railway car compartment, there are two sofas facing each other, each with five seats.

Denote the three passengers who are indifferent about where they sit as ( A, B, ) and ( C ). First, we need to find the total number of ways to arrange all 10 passengers: - The 4 passengers who want to face the engine can sit in [ 5! ] (i.e., 120) ways because they have 5 possible seats. - The 3 passengers who want to sit with their backs to the engine can also be arranged in [ 5! ] (i.e., 120) ways since they also have 5 possible seats. - The 3 passengers who don’t care can be seated in any of the remaining seats.

We need to determine if there are any two-digit numbers overline{ab} and overline{cd} such that their product equals overline{abcd}, where overline{abcd} is a four-digit number formed by concatenating overline{ab} and overline{cd}. 2. Let's denote: [ overline{ab} = 10a + b ] [ overline{cd} = 10c + d ] 3. The concatenation of overline{ab} and overline{cd} gives us: [ overline{abcd} = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ] 4. According to the problem statement, we must have: [ overline{ab} cdot overline{cd} = overline{abcd} ] 5. Substituting the expressions we have for overline{ab} and overline{cd}, we obtain: [ (10a + b) cdot (10c + d) = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ] 6.

So, the equation becomes: [ 100ac + 10ad + 10bc + bd = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d ] 8. For this equation to hold, we equate coefficients of powers of 10 on both sides. We notice: - The coefficient of 1000a on the right side does not have a corresponding term on the left side. - Similarly, the coefficient of 100b on the right side does not have corresponding terms on the left side.

Show that there is a rectangle whose vertices all have the same color. Generalize.","completion":"To solve the problem for (n) colors, follow these steps: 1. **Initial Proposition**: We need to show that for any coloring of the plane in (n) colors, there exists a monochromatic rectangle (i.e., a rectangle whose vertices are all the same color). 2. **Set Up the Grid**: Consider a rectangle with width (n) and length (n^{n+1}). This rectangle can be divided into (1 times 1) squares, leading to an arrangement of the grid. 3. **Counting Segments**: Each horizontal segment of length (n+1) constitutes (n+1) points. The number of such segments in a grid of dimension (n times n^{n+1}) is (n^{n+1} + 1). 4. **Applying Pigeonhole Principle**: There are (n) colors available to color the points along each horizontal segment. By the pigeonhole principle, because the number of horizontal segments (n^{n+1} + 1) is greater than the number of possible colorings of (n+1) points using (n) colors ((n^{n+1})), there must be at least two horizontal segments that are colored identically, i.e., all points on these segments have the same color configuration. 5. **Investigating the Identically Colored Segments**: Consider two such identically colored segments. Each contains points numbered (1) through (n+1). Since the colors must repeat (given the (n+1) choices and (n) discrete colors), each segment must contain at least one color that appears more than once within the segment. 6. **Finding the Monochromatic Rectangle**: Let’s denote the identical segments as (S_1) and (S_2). At least one color will appear at least twice in each segment, say color (c). Let ((i_1, j_1)) and ((i_2, j_2)) be two such points in (S_1) where color (c) appears and likewise, ((i_1', j_1)) and ((i_2', j_2')) in (S_2) with the same coordinates. Setting aside all notations, these points form the vertices of a rectangle with color (c): - ( (i_1, j_1) ) from (S_1) - ( (i_1', j_1) ) from (S_2) - ( (i_2, j_2) ) from (S_1) - ( (i_2', j_2')) from (S_2).

Since this is a parabola that opens upwards (positive leading coefficient), the inequality (x-1)(x-3) < 0 holds between the roots. Therefore, B = {x mid 1 < x < 3}. ① For the intersection A cap B, we need the values of x that are greater than 2 (from set A) and simultaneously between 1 and 3 (from set B). Clearly, this will be the interval from just above 2 to 3, not including 3 since B does not include 3: A cap B = {x mid 2 < x < 3} ② The complement of B with respect to the universal set U, which includes all real numbers, is the set of all real numbers that are not between 1 and 3.

An octagon (i.e., an 8-sided convex polygon) would be our initial assumption since it corresponds to the maximum boundary length on an 8x8 board. However, given the constraints of the chessboard, observe that to maximize the number of vertices while maintaining the convexity, one can place 13 checkers at specific positions such that they form the required convex shape. These positions can be to ensure large spread and avoidance of unnecessary complexity in layout. But practically, placing more than 13 checkers would result in some of the checkers becoming internal and thus not forming the vertex of the convex polygon. So, this intricate manipulation of checker placement reveals that 13 is the maximum feasible number of checkers that can achieve forming the vertices of a convex polygon, adhering to the boundaries and constraints of an 8x8 chessboard. # Conclusion: Hence, the maximum number of checkers that can be arranged on a standard chessboard such that they form the vertices of a convex polygon is (boxed{13})."},{"prompt":"Prove that all numbers in the sequence frac{107811}{3}, frac{110778111}{3}, frac{111077781111}{3}, ldots are perfect cubes.","completion":"1.

Notice that in each operation, we add 1 to a black vertex and 1 to an adjacent white vertex simultaneously. This means the sum of numbers at black vertices and the sum at white vertices both increase by 1 with each operation. 4. Thus, after any number of operations, the difference between the sum of numbers at black vertices and the sum of numbers at white vertices will always be 1. 5. For all numbers at the vertices to be multiples of 3, both the sum of the black vertices and the sum of the white vertices must be multiples of 3.

Let's apply these conditions: 1. **Sum divisible by 3**: Start with a sum of digits that is also the smallest possible sum divisible by 3, which is 12, and then work upwards if needed. 2. **Two even, two odd digits**: Let's initially place smaller digits at the front to minimize the number. 3. **Last two digits divisible by 4**: To be divisible by 4, the number formed by the last two digits must end in a number like 00, 04, 08, 12, ..., 96. Testing the smallest combinations: - Try the smallest four-digit number: thousands digit as 1, hundreds digit as 0 (minimize the number). - Sum = 12, even and odd distribution: Possible pairs for the sum of 11 (needed if the thousand and hundred digits are 1 and 0) could be (2, 9) or (4, 7). However, (2, 9) does not end in a number divisible by 4, while (4, 7) does not as well. - Next, increase the thousands digit to 1 and hundreds digit to 2: Need a sum of 9 from the last two digits with one even and one odd. Possible pairs are (3, 6) but do not end in a number divisible by 4. The other feasible pair is (1, 8), which is perfect as 18 is divisible by 4.

Each of these spheres also touches the inscribed sphere with the center (O) inside the fourth cone, at points ( B, C, ) and ( D ) respectively. 5. Hence, the distances from ( A ) (the common vertex) to the points ( B, C ), and ( D ) are all equal, let’s denote this distance as ( R ). Therefore, points ( B, C ), and ( D ) lie on a sphere centered at ( O). 6. Since ( angle AOB ) (between the cone axis and generating line in the axis plane) is equal to half the vertex angle in the fourth cone, it is equal to the angle between ( AO ) and the generating lines in the axis planes of the original two identical cones, whose magnitudes we are solving for. 7.

Recognizing ( AH = AB ) (tangents from ( A ) to the sphere centered at (O_1)): [ cos 2alpha cos beta + sin 2alpha sin beta = cos beta - tan alpha sin beta Longleftrightarrow cos beta (1-cos 2alpha) = sin beta (tan alpha + sin 2alpha) ] 9.

The remainder when x + 7 is divided by 41 is 12. What is the remainder when x is divided by 82?","completion":"Let's denote the remainder when x is divided by 82 as R. So we can write: x = 82k + R, where k is some integer and 0 ≤ R < 82. Now, we are given that when x + 7 is divided by 41, the remainder is 12. We can write this as: x + 7 = 41m + 12, where m is some integer. Since 82 is exactly twice 41, we can see that if x has a remainder R when divided by 82, then x will have a remainder of either R or R - 41 when divided by 41, depending on whether R is less than 41 or greater than or equal to 41. Given that x + 7 has a remainder of 12 when divided by 41, we can deduce that: R + 7 = 12 or R + 7 = 12 + 41 (since adding 41 to the remainder would still give a valid remainder upon division by 41, as 41 is a divisor of 82). From the first equation, we get R = 12 - 7 = 5. From the second equation, we get R = 12 + 41 - 7 = 46. Both 5 and 46 are less than 82, so they are both valid remainders when x is divided by 82. However, we need to determine which one is the actual remainder for x. Since x + 7 has a remainder of 12 when divided by 41, and 41 * 2 = 82, we can see that if we subtract 7 from x + 7, we should get a number that is a multiple of 41 (since 12 - 7 = 5, which is a remainder when divided by 41). Therefore, the remainder when x is divided by 82 must be 5, because if it were 46, subtracting 7 would give us 39, which is not a multiple of 41. Thus, the remainder when x is divided by 82 is boxed{5} ."},{"prompt":"Which of the following objects' orthographic projections (top, front, and side views) are independent of the object's orientation? A: Cube B: Regular tetrahedron C: Regular triangular pyramid D: Sphere","completion":"**Analysis of the problem**: When looking at orthographic projections, we consider the shape and size of the object as seen from the top, front, and side. For a **sphere**, no matter how you rotate it, the orthographic projections will always be circles that are the largest when cut through the center of the sphere. Therefore, the top, front, and side views are all identical and show the same circle. For the other three options (**cube**, **regular tetrahedron**, and **regular triangular pyramid**), their orthographic projections change with the orientation of the object. If you rotate these shapes, the size and shape of their projections on any of their faces will vary. These shapes do not have isotropic views like the sphere. As such, their appearances in orthographic projection depend on how they are positioned relative to the projection planes. In summary, the orthographic projections of a cube, a regular tetrahedron, and a regular triangular pyramid are dependent on the orientation of the object when it is placed for viewing. Only the sphere maintains the same projection regardless of orientation. **Enhanced Solution**: - A **Cube** has square faces, and the number of visible faces and relative sizes in its orthographic projections depend on its orientation to the viewer. - A **Regular Tetrahedron** has equilateral triangle faces, and the orthographic projection can show anything from a single triangle to a composite shape depending on the viewing angle. - A **Regular Triangular Pyramid** also has triangular faces, but with a square base. Its projections change based on how the pyramid is turned towards the projection planes. - A **Sphere** however, remains consistent in its orthographic view regardless of how it's turned because all surface points are equidistant from the center, creating a consistent circular projection on any plane.

Consider two even composite numbers such as 4, 6, 8, etc. - 10 = 4 + 6 - 12 = 6 + 6 - 14 = 8 + 6 - Therefore, any even number greater than 8 can indeed be expressed as the sum of two composite numbers. 3. **Reasoning for Odd Numbers:** - Consider the case of odd numbers. - Any odd number greater than 12 can be expressed as the sum of 9 and an even composite number. - For example: - 13 = 9 + 4 - 15 = 9 + 6 - 17 = 9 + 8 - Thus, any odd number greater than 12 can be represented as the sum of a composite number 9 (which itself is 3 (times) 3) and another composite number. 4. **Direct Verification for Smaller Numbers:** - We need to directly verify the smallest numbers to check if they fit the description: - 9: Not possible because 9 is itself a composite number and the smallest composite is 4 (9 - 4 = 5 which is prime, and 9 - 6 = 3 which is prime). - 10: Possible as 4 + 6. - 11: Direct check: - 11 cannot be represented as a sum of two composite numbers since 11 is prime. - Any pair of numbers (4, 7), (6, 5), etc., cannot satisfy the sum being 11 as one of them ends up being non-composite. 5. **Conclusion:** - Based on the above observations and direct checks, the largest natural number which cannot be represented as the sum of two composite numbers is ( 11 ).

Since the train is 150 m long, the relative speed between the train and the man is the distance covered by the train divided by the time it takes to cover that distance. Relative speed = Distance / Time Relative speed = 150 m / 6 s = 25 m/s The relative speed is the sum of the speeds of the train and the man because they are moving in opposite directions.

That means ( A ) and ( B ) are midpoints of line segments ( C_1D_1 ) and ( C_2D_2 ), respectively, where ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) belong to ( F ) and ( D_1 ) and ( D_2 ) belong to ( G ). We need to prove that the entire line segment ( AB ) lies within ( H ). Clearly, the line segments ( C_1C_2 ) and ( D_1D_2 ) belong to ( F ) and ( G ) respectively. The set of midpoints of line segments with endpoints on ( C_1C_2 ) and ( D_1D_2 ) forms a parallelogram with diagonal ( AB ). This geometric result follows from the fact that the set of midpoints of line segments, where one point is fixed (say ( C )) and the other moves along ( D_1D_2 ), forms the midline of a triangle ( CD_1D_2 ). 2. **Number of sides ( H ) can have:** Consider two convex polygons ( F ) and ( G ) with ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) sides respectively. The convex hull formed by the midpoints of line segments connecting vertices of ( F ) and ( G ) will have sides depending on how many supporting sets of ( F ) and ( G ) are simultaneously sides and not vertices. The number of sides of ( H ) can range from the largest between ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) up to ( n_1 + n_2 ). This is due to the possibility of overlapping sides reducing the total count. 3. **Perimeter of ( H ):** To determine the perimeter of ( H ), we project an arbitrary axis ( OX ) on the plane. The supporting set of a polygon with respect to the axis ( OX ) is defined as the set of points whose projections on this axis have the maximum value. For convex polygons ( F ) and ( G ) with perimeters ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) respectively, if their supporting sets (with respect to a chosen axis) are line segments of lengths ( a ) and ( b ), then the supporting set of ( H ) (projected on the same axis) will be a line segment with length ( (a+b)/2 ). Here ( a ) and ( b ), the lengths of segments ( a ) and ( b ), account for distances projected on the axis. Hence, the perimeter of ( H ) equals: [ frac{P_1 + P_2}{2} ] In summary: - The number of sides ( H ) can have is any value from the larger of ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) up to ( n_1 + n_2 ). - The perimeter of ( H ) is ( frac{P_1 + P_2}{2} ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{left( frac{P_1 + P_2}{2} right)} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a complex number z = (a+2i)(1bi), where i is the imaginary unit.

Thus, the total number of students 3n = 2a - 1, where a is Andrea's rank. 4. **Solving for Andrea's rank**: We know 2a - 1 equiv 0 pmod{3}, which simplifies to 2a equiv 1 pmod{3}. Solving this congruence, we find a equiv 2 pmod{3}.

We are told that the arithmetic mean of the numbers in the first part equals some natural number ( n ), the second part equals ( 2n ), the third part equals ( 3n ), and so on. Our task is to determine for which values of ( n ) this is possible. 1. **Consideration of Contiguous Natural Numbers**: Suppose we have a contiguous subset of natural numbers. If the number of elements, ( k ), in this subset is even, then the subset can be divided into pairs, each with an odd sum. Since the sum is odd, their average is not an integer. Therefore, ( k ) must be odd for the average to be an integer. 2. **Odd Number of Elements**: If ( k ) is odd, the arithmetic mean of the numbers from 1 to ( k ) corresponds to the middle number in the set.

Moreover, ( f(text{evens}) ) are all odd. We need to find all ( f: mathbb{Z}/16mathbb{Z} to mathbb{Z}/8mathbb{Z} ) since the equation modulo 16 implies the same equation modulo 8. 3. **Case 1: ( f(text{odds}) ) are all even**: - Let ( P(a, b) ) denote the assertion ( f(a)^2 + f(b)^2 + f(a pm b)^2 equiv 1 + 2f(a)f(b)f(a pm b) pmod{16} ). - Suppose ( f(2n+1) ) are all even.

Then ( P(2m+1, 2n+1) ) gives ( 4 + f(2m+2n+2)^2 equiv 1 pmod{16} ), a contradiction since ( -3 ) is not a quadratic residue. - Thus, either ( f(text{odds}) in {2, 6} ) for all odds, or ( f(text{odds}) in {0, 4} ) for all odds. 5. **Further analysis**: - Take ( P(4n+2, 4n+2) ).

Then ( P(a, b) ) gives ( 2 + f(4n)^2 equiv 1 + 2f(4n) ), or ( f(4n) equiv 1 pmod{4} ). - Take ( 4n = a + b ) with ( a, b ) odd. Then ( P(a, b) ) gives ( 8 + f(4n)^2 equiv 1 + 8f(4n) ), or ( f(4n)^2 equiv 1 ). - Thus, ( f(4n) = 1 ) for all ( n ). 8. **Number of solutions for Case 1**: - ( f(2n+1) in {0, 4} ) for all ( n ) or ( f(2n+1) in {2, 6} ) for all ( n ). - ( f(4n+2) = 1 ) for all ( n ) or ( 7 ) for all ( n ). - ( f(4n) = 1 ) for all ( n ). - Total solutions: ( 2 cdot 2^8 cdot 2 = 2^{10} ). 9. **Case 2: ( f(text{odds}) ) are all odd**: - If ( f(x) ) is odd, then ( f(2x) equiv 1 pmod{4} ). - Thus, ( f(text{evens}) equiv 1 pmod{4} ). 10. **Consistency check for Case 2**: - For ( x, y, z ) odd, ( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 equiv 1 + 2xyz pmod{16} iff (x+4)^2 + y^2 + z^2 equiv 1 + 2(x+4)yz pmod{16} ). - Suppose ( f(a) = 1 ) and ( f(b) = 3 ) where ( a, b ) are odd. Then ( f(a+b) = 1 ), so ( 1^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 equiv 1 + 2 cdot 1 cdot 1 cdot 3 ), which is false. - Thus, either ( f(text{odds}) = 1 ) or ( f(text{odds}) = 3 ) for all odds. 11. **Number of solutions for Case 2**: - ( 2 ) for whether ( f(text{odds}) ) is ( 1 ) or ( 3 ). - ( 2^{16} ) for the two solutions mod 8 for each solution mod 4. - Total solutions: ( 2 cdot 2^{16} = 2^{17} ). 12. **Final calculation**: - Total solutions: ( 2^{10} + 2^{17} = 2^{10}(1 + 2^7) = 2^{10} cdot 129 = 2^{10} cdot 129 ). - ( 2^{26} + 2^{33} equiv 2^{26} + 2^{26} cdot 128 equiv 2^{26}(1 + 128) equiv 2^{26} cdot 129 pmod{2017} ). - Calculate ( 2^{26} mod 2017 ): [ 2^{26} equiv 793 pmod{2017}. ] - Thus, ( 2^{26} cdot 129 equiv 793 cdot 129 equiv 793 pmod{2017} ).

Observe that the angles formed by these perpendiculars are ( angle AMB = angle BMC = angle CMA = 120^circ ). This directly follows from the properties of equilateral triangles and the fact that each line drawn perpendicularly from the vertices of ( triangle ABC ) to the sides of ( triangle DEF ) forms these angles. 4. From this configuration, point ( M ) is the intersection point of the perpendiculars and it lies at the center of a circle that can be constructed such that each angle subtended by the circle's segments is ( 120^circ ). 5.

Let this common perimeter be ( p ). 2. **Equating areas as per the given conditions:** - Since the areas of ( triangle PAB ), ( triangle PBC ), and ( triangle PCA ) are equal, using the formula for the area of a triangle, we can say: [ text{Area}(triangle PAB) = text{Area}(triangle PBC) = text{Area}(triangle PCA) ] 3. **Using the properties of medians:** - For ( triangle PAB ) and ( triangle PBC ) to have the same area, ( BP ) must be in such a way that it acts as a median with respect to the segment ( AC ). - Assume ( M ) is the midpoint of (overline{AC}).

As a result, if ( PACB ) is a parallelogram, with ( overline{PB} parallel overline{AC} ) and vice versa, it follows that it is a rectangle. - Hence, ( angle ACB ) must equal ( 90^circ ). # Conclusion: 1.

Let ( p ) be the price per liter of ordinary gasoline in francs. 2. **Set up the System of Equations**: - The total capacity of the fuel tanks is given by: [ x + X = 70 ] - The cost to fill the small car’s tank is: [ x cdot p = 45 ] - The cost to fill the large car’s tank is: [ X cdot (p + 0.29) = 68 ] 3. **Solve for ( p ) from the second equation**: [ p = frac{45}{x} ] 4. **Substitute ( p ) into the third equation**: [ X left( frac{45}{x} + 0.29 right) = 68 ] Simplify this equation: [ X cdot frac{45}{x} + 0.29X = 68 ] [ frac{45X}{x} + 0.29X = 68 ] Multiply through by ( x ) to clear the fraction: [ 45X + 0.29Xx = 68x ] 5. **Use the first equation to express ( X ) in terms of ( x )**: [ X = 70 - x ] 6. **Substitute ( X = 70 - x ) into the equation obtained after clearing the fraction**: [ 45(70 - x) + 0.29x(70 - x) = 68x ] Simplify and distribute: [ 3150 - 45x + 20.3x - 0.29x^2 = 68x ] Combine like terms: [ 3150 - 24.7x - 0.29x^2 = 68x ] Bring all terms to one side of the equation to set it to zero: [ 0.29x^2 + 68x - 24.7x - 3150 = 0 ] Simplify: [ 0.29x^2 + 43.3x - 3150 = 0 ] Multiply through by 100 to clear decimals: [ 29x^2 + 4330x - 315000 = 0 ] 7. **Solve the quadratic equation**: Note that the quadratic can be factored if we recognize that: [ (x - 30)(2x + 1050) = 0 ] - Setting each factor to zero gives: [ x - 30 = 0 implies x = 30 ] [ 2x + 1050 = 0 implies x = -525 quad (text{not feasible as x must be positive}) ] 8. **Determine the values for ( X )**: Using ( x = 30 ): [ X = 70 - x = 70 - 30 = 40 ] # Conclusion Thus, the capacity of the small car's fuel tank is 30 liters, and the capacity of the large car's fuel tank is 40 liters.

First, let's examine the statement alpha: \\"integer n is divisible by 2\\". If we pick a specific example, say n=2, this satisfies alpha since 2 is divisible by 2. However, n=2 is not divisible by 6, which means that satisfying alpha (being divisible by 2) does not necessarily imply that n will satisfy beta (being divisible by 6). This shows that alpha does not imply beta. Next, we consider the statement beta: \\"integer n is divisible by 6\\". If an integer is divisible by 6, then it must inherently be divisible by 2, because 6 itself is divisible by 2. This means that every number that satisfies beta will also satisfy alpha. Therefore, beta implies alpha. From these observations, we conclude that alpha (divisibility by 2) is a necessary condition for beta (divisibility by 6), because without alpha, beta cannot be true.

This must hold for any combination of three indices with a fourth different index. 2. **Identifying the Tuple Structure**: - Consider there are nine numbers and we are picking any four to sum up to 100. - That means every group of four must sum to 100. This implies that each element in the tuple is most likely very similar if not the same. 3. **Exploring Simpler Examples**: - Suppose we have nine numbers which are all equal, say (a_1 = a_2 = cdots = a_9 = x).

The equation representing the butterfat before and after mixing is: 0.40x (from the 40% milk) + 1.6 (from the 10% milk) = 0.20(x + 16) Now we solve for x: 0.40x + 1.6 = 0.20x + 3.2 Subtract 0.20x from both sides: 0.20x + 1.6 = 3.2 Subtract 1.6 from both sides: 0.20x = 1.6 Divide both sides by 0.20: x = 1.6 / 0.20 x = 8 So, you would need 8 gallons of the 40% butterfat milk to mix with the 16 gallons of 10% butterfat milk to obtain a mixture that is boxed{20%} butterfat."},{"prompt":"The modulus of the complex number z=(3+2i)i (where i is the imaginary unit) is ______.","completion":"Given: z=(3+2i)i=3i-2, Therefore, |z|= sqrt{(-2)^2+3^2}= sqrt{13}.

Since 35% of the crayons are new, we can calculate this number as follows: Number of new crayons = 35% of 500 Number of new crayons = 0.35 * 500 Number of new crayons = 175 Now, we know that the number of new crayons is three times the number of broken crayons. Let's denote the number of broken crayons as B. Therefore: Number of new crayons = 3 * Number of broken crayons 175 = 3 * B B = 175 / 3 B = 58.333... Since we can't have a fraction of a crayon, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. However, since the number of broken crayons is a percentage of the total, we don't need to round at this stage. We'll keep the exact value for the calculation and denote the percentage of broken crayons as x%. x% of 500 = 58.333... x = (58.333... / 500) * 100 x = 11.666...% Now, let's find the percentage of slightly used crayons. We know that the total percentage must add up to 100%, so: Percentage of slightly used crayons = 100% - (Percentage of new crayons + Percentage of broken crayons) Percentage of slightly used crayons = 100% - (35% + 11.666...%) Percentage of slightly used crayons = 100% - 46.666...% Percentage of slightly used crayons = 53.333...% Therefore, approximately boxed{53.33%} of the crayons are slightly used."},{"prompt":"Find a point ( M ) inside an arbitrary triangle ( ABC ) such that when circles are constructed on segments ( MA ), ( MB ), and ( MC ) as diameters, the lengths of their common chords will be equal.","completion":"1. **Label the Points of Intersection:** To start, let's define the points of intersection of the circles constructed on segments ( M A ), ( M B ), and ( M C ).

Therefore, the angles ( angle A P M ) and ( angle B P M ), each subtended by the diameters ( M A ) and ( M B ) respectively, are right angles. 3. **Solution on ( P ):** Since ( angle A P M ) and ( angle B P M ) are both right angles, it follows that: [ angle A P M + angle B P M = 90^circ + 90^circ = 180^circ ] Therefore, ( P ) must lie on the line segment ( AB ) and ( P ) is the foot of the perpendicular from ( M ) to ( AB ). 4. **Critical Points ( Q ) and ( R ):** Similarly, point ( Q ) lies on line segment ( BC ) and is the foot of the perpendicular from ( M ) to ( BC ), and point ( R ) lies on line segment ( CA ) and is the foot of the perpendicular from ( M ) to ( CA ). 5. **Equal Distance from Sides:** Since ( M ) lies on the perpendiculars drawn to all three sides (( AB ), ( BC ), and ( CA )), it is equidistant to all three sides of the triangle ( ABC ). 6. **Conclusion:** The only point in any triangle that is equidistant from all three sides is the incenter of the triangle, which is the point at which the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.

A parallelepiped has three pairs of parallel faces, and each pair contributes four edges to the structure, totaling twelve edges. When a line is drawn on a face, there are two edges on that face that are not collinear with the drawn line. The face opposite to this also has two edges. These do not count towards the edges not coplanar with the drawn line since they lie in the parallel planes to the plane containing the drawn line. There are two cases to consider for the remaining eight edges: - If the drawn line does not intersect any edge of the parallelepiped, then all the remaining eight edges (two on each of the other four faces) are not coplanar with the line. - If the drawn line intersects an edge of the parallelepiped, then one of the remaining edges on that face (not including the one intersected) will be coplanar with the line. The same applies to the opposite face. In this scenario, there are six edges that remain not coplanar with the line on the other faces. So, depending on the orientation of the line drawn, the possible number of edges of the parallelepiped that are not coplanar with this line can be 8 (if the line does not intersect an edge) or 6 (if the line does intersect with one edge). If the line intersects two non-adjacent edges (which occurs when one endpoint of the line is on one vertex, and the other endpoint is on the vertex diagonally across on the same face), then the parallelogram formed by two other edges on the same face is collapsed, and those two edges are now co-linear and coplanar with the line. This means the remaining number of edges not coplanar would be seven. To summarize, the number of edges of the parallelepiped not coplanar with the line could be: - 8 edges (the line does not intersect any edge), - 7 edges (the line intersects two non-adjacent edges), - 6 edges (the line intersects one edge).

The hundreds of thousands place (the first digit) can only be filled with the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. For the remaining places - ten thousands, thousands, hundreds, tens, and units - any of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 can be used, provided they are not repeating. The sum of all the six-digit numbers formed is therefore the sum of all possible values at each place, which can be calculated as: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) cdot A_5^5 cdot 10^5 + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 0) cdot A_4^4 cdot 10^4 + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 0) cdot A_4^4 cdot 10^3 + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 0) cdot A_4^4 cdot 10^2 + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 0) cdot A_4^4 cdot 10 + (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 0) cdot A_4^4. Since 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 and A_5^5 = 5! = 120 and A_4^4 = 4! = 24, we can simplify this to: 15 cdot 120 cdot 10^5 + 15 cdot 24 cdot (10^4 + 10^3 + 10^2 + 10 + 1). The term (10^4 + 10^3 + 10^2 + 10 + 1) can be factored out as 11111, so we have: 15 cdot 120 cdot 10^5 + 15 cdot 24 cdot 11111 = 15 cdot (120 cdot 10^5 + 24 cdot 11111).

Remember that the square of a negative number is positive. (-3)^{2} = (-3) * (-3) = 9 2. Compute sqrt{4}: The square root of 4 is the number that, when squared, equals 4. There are two numbers that can satisfy this condition: 2 and -2.

For tangerines, we are 2 short, so we need to add 2 to the total to find the number that can be evenly distributed: 268 + 2 = 270 tangerines. For mangoes, we have 120 mangoes with 12 left over, so the number that can be evenly distributed is 120 - 12 = 108 mangoes. Now, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these three numbers (162, 270, and 108) to determine the maximum number of trucks that can be used to evenly distribute the fruits. Let's find the GCD: GCD of 162 and 270: 162 = 2 × 3^4 × 1 270 = 2 × 3^3 × 5 The common factors are 2 and 3^3 (which is 27), so the GCD of 162 and 270 is 2 × 27 = 54. Now, let's find the GCD of 54 and 108: 54 = 2 × 3^3 108 = 2^2 × 3^3 The common factors are 2 and 3^3 (which is 27), so the GCD of 54 and 108 is 2 × 27 = 54. Since the GCD of all three numbers is 54, this means that the fruits can be evenly distributed into 54 trucks. However, since we are looking for the maximum number of trucks, we need to divide each of the adjusted fruit totals by 54 to see if they all divide evenly. 162 ÷ 54 = 3 (evenly distributed) 270 ÷ 54 = 5 (evenly distributed) 108 ÷ 54 = 2 (evenly distributed) Since all three numbers divide evenly by 54, the maximum number of trucks that can be used to evenly distribute the fruits is boxed{54} ."},{"prompt":"Given left(a+bright)^{2}=m, left(abright)^{2}=n, find ab in terms of m and n.","completion":"Given the equations left(a+bright)^{2}=m and left(a-bright)^{2}=n, we aim to find ab in terms of m and n.

Given that Carl is exactly 3 years old today, we have (C = 3). Alice is 2 years older than Bob, hence (A = B + 2). 2. **Understand the condition for Bob's age**: It's mentioned that today starts the first of 4 occasions when Bob's age (B) will be a multiple of Carl's age (C). This implies (B) and (B + n) must be multiples of (C) and (C + n) respectively for (n = 0, 1, 2, 3). 3. **Analyze the condition for multiple ages**: Since (C = 3), (B) must be a multiple of 3 today. Given that this is one of 4 such occasions, the differences between (B - C = B - 3) must align adequately with certain multiples. 4. **Consider the minimum cases with 4 specific multiples**: Let (B = 3k) for minimum (k) satisfying the conditions explained. The simplest value for (k) that allows for three more multiples within a small range is (k = 1), thus (B = 3). Therefore, (A = B + 2 = 5). 5. **Calculate Alice's age when her age is a multiple of Carl's age**: For Alice's age (A = 5) and Carl's age (C = 3), the next multiple of Carl’s age considering Alice’s start point of 5 years would likely be when (C) multiplies to exceed or meet (A). (A) progressing to next multiple of 3 other than 3 would be 6. To reach (6), (A) needs 1 year, hence (C = 3 + 1 = 4). 6. **Calculate future ages and sum the digits**: (A) at the time of next multiplicative condition would be (6), and the sum of the digits is (6).

Since he can walk 3 dogs at once and 6 dogs need 60-minute walks, he will do 6 / 3 = 2 sets of 60-minute walks per day. Each 60-minute walk earns him 20, so for the 2 sets per day, he earns 2 * 20 = 40 per day from 60-minute walks. Now, let's calculate how much he earns from 60-minute walks in a week (5 days): 40 per day * 5 days = 200 per week from 60-minute walks. Since Johnny makes 1500 in a week, we need to find out how much he makes from the 30-minute walks: 1500 total weekly earnings - 200 from 60-minute walks = 1300 from 30-minute walks. Now, let's calculate how many 30-minute walks he does in a week. Each 30-minute walk earns him 15, so: 1300 / 15 per walk = 86.67, which we'll round down to 86 walks (since he can't do a fraction of a walk). Now we need to find out how many 30-minute walks he does per day. Since he works 5 days a week: 86 walks / 5 days = 17.2, which we'll round down to 17 walks per day (since he can't do a fraction of a walk in a day). So, Johnny does 17 30-minute walks per day. Since he can walk 3 dogs at once, he does 17 / 3 = 5.67, which we'll round down to 5 sets of 30-minute walks per day (since he can't walk a fraction of a set). Now, let's calculate the total number of hours Johnny works per day. He does 2 sets of 60-minute walks and 5 sets of 30-minute walks: 2 sets * 60 minutes/set + 5 sets * 30 minutes/set = 120 minutes + 150 minutes = 270 minutes per day.

We can similarly deduce for the last as it is symmetrical. - For the second row, there are two choices: either the first square or the second square can be marked. - Once the choice in the second row is made, the choice in each subsequent row is determined uniquely, as no marked squares can be in adjacent columns. - Hence, there are 2 possibilities for marking the squares when the first row is empty. - Similarly, there are 2 possibilities for marking the squares if the last row is empty. - Therefore, there are ( 2 + 2 = 4 ) possible configurations if either the first or the last row is empty. - **Case 2:** The empty row is neither the first nor the last row. - There are eight positions for the empty row (from the second to the ninth row). - Each block of marked rows, divided by the empty row, behaves similarly to the first case where the configuration is determined by the choice in the first row of the block. - Each block of filled rows has two configurations (either the first column is marked or the second column is marked in the initial row). - Thus, for each empty row there are ( 2 times 2 = 4 ) configurations of the blocks around it. - Hence, there are ( 8 times 4 = 32 ) configurations for this case. 4. **Total Configurations:** Adding the number of configurations from both cases, we get: [ 4 quad (text{first or last row empty}) + 32 quad (text{any other row empty}) = 36 ] In conclusion, the total number of ways to mark the grid such that no two marked squares are adjacent is: [ boxed{36} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle (ABC), it is known that (AB = a) and (BC = b).

Let the incircle of the triangle be tangent to the sides (BC), (CA), and (AB) at points (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1), respectively. 2. **Equal Tangents Theorem:** From the properties of the circle, we know that the tangents from any external point to a circle are equal. Hence, [ CA_1 = CB_1 ] Since (CA_1) and (CB_1) are the tangents from (C) to the incircle. 3. **Sum of Tangents:** For the tangents to be equal: [ CA_1 + CB_1 = 2CA_1 ] We know the sum of all tangents: [ 2CA_1 = a + b - c ] 4. **Relation with ( varrho ):** The length (CA_1) can also be expressed using the radius ( varrho ) of the incircle. Using the cotangent function (cotangent of the half-angle), we have: [ CA_1 = varrho cdot cot frac{gamma}{2} ] 5. **Equating Expressions:** From the above two expressions, we get: [ a + b - c = 2CA_1 = 2 varrho cdot cot frac{gamma}{2} ] 6. **Generalization:** Similarly, by considering other pairs of tangents, we include: [ a + c - b = 2 varrho cdot cot frac{beta}{2} ] and [ b + c - a = 2 varrho cdot cot frac{alpha}{2} ] 7. **Special Case for Right-Angle Triangle:** When (gamma = 90^circ), we have (cot frac{90^circ}{2} = cot 45^circ = 1). Thus, [ a + b - c = 2 varrho ] This recovers the specific property for right-angled triangles. # Conclusion: By the derived equations, we have successfully generalized the given property for any triangle (ABC): [ a + b - c = 2 varrho cdot cot frac{gamma}{2} ] [ a + c - b = 2 varrho cdot cot frac{beta}{2} ] [ b + c - a = 2 varrho cdot cot frac{alpha}{2} ] Where ( varrho ) is the radius of the incircle and ( alpha ), ( beta ), and ( gamma ) are the angles opposite the sides ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ).

The number of triangles that can be formed from these 4 points is ( binom{4}{3} = 4 ). However, at most 3 out of these 4 triangles can be acute. - This result can be understood by examining the properties of quadrilaterals. In a convex quadrilateral, at least one diagonal must be an external angle to at least one triangle, thus making it obtuse. 4. **Extending to 5 Points**: - Consider any subset of 5 points. The number of triangles formed is ( binom{5}{3} = 10 ). - For these 5 points, applying our understanding from the prior step, we know each set of 4 points forms at most 3 acute triangles. - To avoid overcounting, we calculate as follows: - Each subgroup of 4 can form at most 3 acute triangles. We select these with 5 points taken at a time as: - [ frac{binom{5}{4} cdot 3}{binom{5}{3}} = frac{5 cdot 3}{10} = frac{15}{10} = 1.5 ] - This shows that among any 5 points, at most ( 7 ) out of the ( 10 ) possible triangles can be acute.
