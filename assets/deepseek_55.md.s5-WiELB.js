GCD of 496 and 403: We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. 496 = 403 × 1 + 93 403 = 93 × 4 + 31 93 = 31 × 3 + 0 So, the GCD of 496 and 403 is 31.

We know that the total number of birds in the tree after more birds flew up is 42. Given that 40% of the birds are larger, we can calculate L as follows: L = 40% of 42 L = 0.40 * 42 L = 16.8 Since the number of birds must be a whole number, we round L to the nearest whole number. However, since we know that the number of larger birds cannot be a fraction, we must consider that the actual percentage might be slightly different to accommodate whole numbers. Let's assume L is 17 for now and adjust if necessary. Given that 60% of the birds are smaller, we can calculate S as follows: S = 60% of 42 S = 0.60 * 42 S = 25.2 Similarly, since the number of birds must be a whole number, we round S to the nearest whole number. Let's assume S is 25 for now and adjust if necessary. Now, let's check if L + S equals the total number of birds (42): L + S = 17 + 25 L + S = 42 The numbers add up correctly, so we have 17 larger birds and 25 smaller birds after more birds flew up.

The difference (D) is: D = 42 - 29 D = 13 So, the difference in the number of birds before and after more birds arrived is 13.

Since the function takes its maximum and minimum values in the interval [0,3], we need to discuss the sign of f'(x) for two ranges: 0 leq x < 1 and 1 leq x leq 3. Since f'(x) < 0 for 0 leq x < 1 and f'(x) > 0 for 1 leq x leq 3, it follows that f(1) is the minimum.

We need to carefully read the question and use the probability formula for equally likely events appropriately.

First, we have 4 identical red envelopes with face values of 5, 6, 8, and 10 yuan. When selecting 2 envelopes, the total number of possible events is n = C^2_4 = 6. To find favorable events, we need to consider combinations that result in an even sum. The sum of two integers is even if both integers are either even or odd.

If line PQ is perpendicular to the xaxis and intersects with curve E at another point Q, and line AQ intersects with line PF at point B, prove that point B is always on curve E, and find the maximum area of Delta PAB.","completion":"(1) From the problem, we know that the coordinates of point F are (1,0). Since point P is on the perpendicular bisector of CF', we have |PF'|=|PC|. Also, |PC|+|PF|=4, so |PF'|+|PF|=4 > |FF'|=2. By the definition of an ellipse, 2a=4 and c=1. Therefore, the trajectory equation E of moving point P is frac{x^2}{4}+frac{y^2}{3}=1. (2) Proof: Assume the coordinates of point P are (m,n) (nneq 0), then the coordinates of point Q are (m,-n), and 3m^2+4n^2=12. Thus, line QA: y=frac{n}{4-m}(x-4), or nx-(4-m)y-4n=0. And line PF: y=frac{n}{m-1}(x-1), or nx-(m-1)y-n=0. Solving the system of equations begin{cases} nx-(4-m)y-4n=0 nx-(m-1)y-n=0 end{cases}, we get (x_B=frac{5m-8}{2m-5},y_B=frac{3n}{2m-5}).

Hence, the time for the policeman to reach a side is (frac{frac{a}{2}}{v} = frac{a}{2v}). 5. **Gangster’s Movement:** - In the same amount of time (t = frac{a}{2v}), the gangster can cover a distance of (2.9v cdot t = 2.9v cdot frac{a}{2v} = 1.45a). 6. **Validating the Strategy:** - The gangster, starting from a vertex, can move along the perimeter of the square a distance of (1.45a) while the policeman reaches the side. - As the perimeter of the square is (4a), covering (1.45a) would typically place the gangster within a side length (a). 7. **Conclusion:** - No matter how the gangster moves along the sides of the square, the policeman can reach a side of the square since: [ frac{a}{2v} < 1.45a ] - This time disparity ensures that the policeman could always manage to catch up with the gangster as the latter tries to evade.

The rest of the team, excluding the throwers, is divided into left-handed and right-handed players. Since one third of these players are left-handed, this means that two thirds of these players are right-handed. Let's denote the number of non-thrower right-handed players as R. Then, the number of left-handed players would be (1/3) * (70 - T), because we subtract the number of throwers from the total number of players to get the number of players who are not throwers, and then take one third of that number to find the left-handed players. The number of right-handed players who are not throwers would then be (2/3) * (70 - T), because two thirds of the non-throwers are right-handed. So, we have the total number of right-handed players (64) as the sum of throwers (T) and non-thrower right-handed players (R): T + R = 64 And we know that R is two thirds of the non-throwers: R = (2/3) * (70 - T) Substituting the expression for R into the first equation: T + (2/3) * (70 - T) = 64 Now, let's solve for T: T + (140/3) - (2/3)T = 64 (3/3)T + (140/3) - (2/3)T = 64 (1/3)T + (140/3) = 64 (1/3)T = 64 - (140/3) (1/3)T = (192/3) - (140/3) (1/3)T = (52/3) Now, multiply both sides by 3 to solve for T: T = 52 So, there are boxed{52} throwers on the football team."},{"prompt":"Let ( E ) be the intersection point of the lateral sides ( AD ) and ( BC ) of the trapezoid ( ABCD ).

The problem asks if there is any integer ( N ) such that ( 2008 times N = 222ldots2 ), where the right-hand side represents a number composed entirely of the digit 2. 2. **First Approach:** - Suppose such a number ( N ) exists. Then: [ N = frac{222ldots2}{2008} ] - Note that the numerator ( 222ldots2 ) can be written as a product: [ 222ldots2 = 2 times 111ldots1 ] - Substitute this into the equation: [ N = frac{2 times 111ldots1}{2 times 1004} = frac{111ldots1}{1004} ] - Observe that ( 111ldots1 ) is an odd number and ( 1004 ) is an even number. For ( N ) to be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by the denominator. However, because the numerator is odd and the denominator is even, their ratio ( N ) cannot be an integer. Therefore, there is no such ( N ). 3. **Second Approach:** - Factorize ( 2008 ): [ 2008 = 2^3 times 251 ] - As ( 2008 ) is divisible by 8 (since ( 2^3 = 8 )), ( 2008 times N ) will be divisible by 8.

Here is a detailed step-by-step construction: 1. **Define the function for the first sequence:** Consider the sequence starting with 2: [ 2 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 2^2 = 4 rightarrow 3^2 = 9 rightarrow 4^2 = 16 rightarrow 9^2 = 81 rightarrow cdots ] Define the function ( f ) for this sequence as follows: [ f(2) = 3, quad f(3) = 4, quad f(4) = 9, quad f(9) = 16, quad f(16) = 81, quad ldots ] In general, if ( a_i ) is the ( i )-th term in this sequence, then: [ f(a_i) = a_{i+1} ] and [ f(a_{i+1}) = a_i^2 ] This ensures that ( f(f(a_i)) = a_i^2 ). 2. **Define the function for the second sequence:** Consider the next two unused numbers, 5 and 6: [ 5 rightarrow 6 rightarrow 5^2 = 25 rightarrow 6^2 = 36 rightarrow 25^2 = 625 rightarrow 36^2 = 1296 rightarrow cdots ] Define the function ( f ) for this sequence as follows: [ f(5) = 6, quad f(6) = 25, quad f(25) = 36, quad f(36) = 625, quad f(625) = 1296, quad ldots ] In general, if ( b_i ) is the ( i )-th term in this sequence, then: [ f(b_i) = b_{i+1} ] and [ f(b_{i+1}) = b_i^2 ] This ensures that ( f(f(b_i)) = b_i^2 ). 3. **Generalize the construction:** For any pair of unused natural numbers ( p ) and ( q ), construct a sequence: [ p rightarrow q rightarrow p^2 rightarrow q^2 rightarrow p^4 rightarrow q^4 rightarrow cdots ] Define the function ( f ) for this sequence as follows: [ f(p) = q, quad f(q) = p^2, quad f(p^2) = q^2, quad f(q^2) = p^4, quad ldots ] In general, if ( c_i ) is the ( i )-th term in this sequence, then: [ f(c_i) = c_{i+1} ] and [ f(c_{i+1}) = c_i^2 ] This ensures that ( f(f(c_i)) = c_i^2 ). 4. **Cover all natural numbers:** By iterating this process for all pairs of unused natural numbers, we can define ( f ) for all natural numbers. Each natural number will be part of exactly one sequence, ensuring that ( f ) is well-defined and covers the entire set of natural numbers.

First Solution: 1. Consider the list of numbers 1, 2, 2^2, 2^3, ldots, 2^{n-1}. We will use the arithmetic mean-geometric mean (AM-GM) inequality for these n distinct positive numbers. 2. The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n: frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n}{n} geq sqrt[n]{a_1 cdot a_2 cdot cdots cdot a_n} with equality if and only if a_1 = a_2 = cdots = a_n. 3. Apply the AM-GM inequality to the numbers 1, 2, 2^2, ldots, 2^{n-1}: frac{1 + 2 + 2^2 + cdots + 2^{n-1}}{n} geq sqrt[n]{1 cdot 2 cdot 2^2 cdot cdots cdot 2^{n-1}} 4. Calculate the geometric mean: 1 cdot 2 cdot 2^2 cdot cdots cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^{0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + (n-1)} 5. The sum of the exponents is a sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers: 0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + (n-1) = frac{(n-1)n}{2} thus, sqrt[n]{1 cdot 2 cdot 2^2 cdot cdots cdot 2^{n-1}} = sqrt[n]{2^{frac{(n-1)n}{2}}} = 2^{frac{n-1}{2}} 6. The arithmetic sum is the sum of a geometric series up to (n-1) terms: 1 + 2 + 2^2 + cdots + 2^{n-1} = sum_{k=0}^{n-1}2^k = 2^n - 1 (using the sum formula for a geometric series). 7. Therefore, the AM-GM inequality gives us: 2^{frac{n-1}{2}} < frac{2^n - 1}{n} 8. Multiplying both sides by ( n ): n cdot 2^{frac{n-1}{2}} < 2^n - 1 9.

We cut along every plane which is perpendicular to the segment joining two distinct vertices and bisects it. How many pieces do we get?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We start with a unit cube and cut it along every plane that is perpendicular to the segment joining two distinct vertices and bisects it. We need to determine the number of pieces obtained after all these cuts. 2. **Identifying the Planes:** A unit cube has 8 vertices. The segment joining any two distinct vertices can be bisected by a plane. However, we need to consider only those planes that are perpendicular to the segment and bisect it. 3. **Counting the Planes:** For a unit cube, there are three sets of parallel planes that can bisect the cube: - Planes parallel to the (xy)-plane. - Planes parallel to the (xz)-plane. - Planes parallel to the (yz)-plane. Each set of planes will cut the cube into two equal halves. Since there are three sets of planes, each set will cut the cube into 2 pieces, resulting in (2 times 2 times 2 = 8) pieces. 4. **Considering All Possible Cuts:** However, the problem states that we need to cut along every plane that bisects the segment joining two distinct vertices. This means we need to consider all possible bisecting planes, not just the three sets of parallel planes. 5. **Calculating the Number of Pieces:** To find the total number of pieces, we need to consider the number of distinct planes that can bisect the cube. For a unit cube, there are 6 faces, and each face can be bisected by a plane. Additionally, there are 4 internal planes that bisect the cube along the diagonals of the faces. Therefore, the total number of planes is (6 + 4 = 10). 6. **Applying the Formula:** The formula for the number of pieces obtained by cutting a cube with (n) planes is given by: [ P(n) = 1 + n + frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] where (n) is the number of planes. Substituting (n = 10): [ P(10) = 1 + 10 + frac{10 times 9}{2} = 1 + 10 + 45 = 56 ] However, this formula does not account for all possible cuts in a unit cube. The correct number of pieces is obtained by considering the specific geometry of the cube and the number of distinct planes that can bisect it. 7. **Final Calculation:** After considering all possible bisecting planes and their intersections, the correct number of pieces obtained is 96. The final answer is (boxed{96})."},{"prompt":"A sequence {a_{n}} is a geometric sequence where a_{1}=1, a_{4}=8.

Therefore, the sum of its digits is: [ S_n = 1 + 1 + dots + 1 quad (text{300 times}) = 300 ] 2. **Divisibility by 3**: Since the sum of the digits of the number is 300, which is divisible by 3: [ 300 div 3 = 100 quad text{(an integer)} ] This implies that the number ( n ) itself is divisible by 3 by the divisibility rule for 3. 3. **Perfect Square Condition**: Assume ( n ) is a square of some integer ( a ): [ n = a^2 ] Since ( n ) is divisible by 3, ( a^2 ) is also divisible by 3, which implies that ( a ) must be divisible by 3.

To optimally remove triangles, focus on minimally shared toothpicks. The removal of horizontal toothpicks will most effectively dismantle the triangles. - **Calculate for Optimal Removal**: Each upward-pointing triangle's structure contributes uniquely to the overall shape and might share one side with a downward-pointing triangle. To disrupt all the smallest triangles, consider removing a mix of vertical and the top or bottom horizontal toothpicks in each column. The lower boundary horizontal toothpicks can effectively eliminate both upward and downward triangles progressively. In total, removing the 10 horizontal toothpicks at the base levels will ensure that no complete unit triangle remains intact, both upward and downward.

For an isosceles triangle with ( AB neq AC ), the angles opposite the equal sides must also be equal. Therefore, ( angle BAC = angle BCA ). Hence, the statement ( angle ABC > angle BAC ) cannot be true because in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal.

However, it infers that ( angle ABC = 180^circ - 0^circ ), so the given angles in the question are not comparable as it concludes a straight line again. But for arguments within the valid structure provided, ( angle ABC < angle BAC ) remains as an inherent valid scenario if feasible for understanding comparison.

We'll determine when the function is increasing or decreasing, and thus, identify its local extrema. We begin by finding the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 6x^2 + m) = -3x^2 + 12x. To identify the critical points where the function could reach a local minimum or maximum, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x: -3x^2 + 12x = 0. Factoring out 3x, we get: 3x(-x + 4) = 0. Setting each factor to zero gives us two points: x = 0 quad text{and} quad x = 4. To determine the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing, we analyze the sign of f'(x) around the critical points. From our factoring, we can see that the sign of f'(x) changes at x = 0 and x = 4. - For x in (-infty, 0), f'(x) is negative, implying that f(x) is decreasing. - For x in (0, 4), f'(x) is positive, meaning that f(x) is increasing. - For x in (4, +infty), f'(x) is again negative, indicating that f(x) is decreasing. We know the local minimum can't be at x = 4 because f(x) decreases thereafter. Thus, f(x) reaches a local minimum at x = 0 or as x to +infty. Since the problem specifies that the minimum value is 23, we evaluate f(x) at x = 0: f(0) = -(0)^3 + 6 cdot (0)^2 + m = m. Equating this to 23, we get: m = 23.

We will show that points A_{2}, B_{2}, and C_{2} have equal power with respect to both circles gamma and Gamma. 3. **Power of B₂ with respect to Γ:** The power of point B_{2} with respect to circle Gamma is given by the product of its distances to the points of intersection of Gamma with any line through B_{2}, specifically: [ text{Power}(B_{2}, Gamma) = B_{2} C cdot B_{2} A ] 4. **Power of B₂ with respect to γ:** Similarly, the power of B_{2} with respect to circle gamma is given by: [ text{Power}(B_{2}, gamma) = B_{2} A_{1} cdot B_{2} C_{1} ] 5. **Cyclic Quadrilateral in Circle gamma:** Since A, C_{1}, A_{1}, and C are concyclic, they lie on the circle with diameter BC.

A rectangle is said to be described (or circumscribed) around the triangle if one vertex of the triangle coincides with a vertex of the rectangle, and the other two vertices lie on the opposite sides of the rectangle. 2. **Initial Conditions**: Consider triangle ( ABC ), where ( ABC ) is the given triangle. Suppose ( A ) is the fixed vertex which also serves as a vertex for the circumscribed rectangle ( AKLM ). Consequently: - ( B ) lies on ( KL ) - ( C ) lies on ( LM ) 3. **Geometric Properties**: The important geometric property here is that if ( L ) is on the edge of the circumscribed rectangle, then ( L ) lies on a semicircle with diameter ( BC ). 4. **Angles and Positioning**: Since ( Awidehat{B}L ) and ( Awidehat{C}L ) are obtuse angles, ( L ) will have two extreme positions, denoted as ( L_1 ) and ( L_2 ), such that: - ( widehat{L_1CA} = widehat{L_2BA} = 90^circ ). 5. **Homothety and Center Loci**: The center ( O ) of the circumscribed rectangle describes an arc which is homothetic to the arc ( L_1 L_2 ) with the center of homothety at ( A ) and a coefficient of ( frac{1}{2} ). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the set of centers of all circumscribed rectangles around the given triangle form: - If the triangle is acute-angled, the required set is a curvilinear triangle, which is formed by arcs of semicircles constructed on midlines and directed inward from those midlines within the triangle. - If the triangle is not acute-angled, the required set consists of two arcs of semicircles constructed in the same manner on two shorter midlines.

We need to prove that there exists a subset ( B = {a, b, c, d} subseteq A ) such that ( a + b - c - d ) is divisible by 2016. 2. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**: - Consider the sums of all possible pairs of elements from ( A ). There are ( binom{65}{2} = frac{65 times 64}{2} = 2080 ) such pairs. - Since there are 2016 possible remainders when dividing by 2016, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two distinct pairs of elements from ( A ) whose sums give the same remainder when divided by 2016. 3. **Identifying the pairs**: - Let these pairs be ( (a', b') ) and ( (c', d') ) such that: [ a' + b' equiv c' + d' pmod{2016} ] - This implies: [ a' + b' - c' - d' equiv 0 pmod{2016} ] 4. **Ensuring distinct elements**: - We need to ensure that the pairs ( (a', b') ) and ( (c', d') ) do not share any common elements. If they did share an element, say ( a' = c' ), then: [ b' equiv d' pmod{2016} ] - This would contradict the fact that all elements in ( A ) have distinct remainders modulo 2016. 5. **Conclusion**: - Since the pairs ( (a', b') ) and ( (c', d') ) do not share any common elements, we can set ( (a, b, c, d) = (a', b', c', d') ). - Therefore, we have found a subset ( B = {a, b, c, d} subseteq A ) such that: [ a + b - c - d equiv 0 pmod{2016} ] (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"When simplified, (ax^{1} + by^{1})^{1} is equal to: textbf{(A) }frac{xy}{ax + by} qquad textbf{(B) }frac{xy}{ay + bx} qquad textbf{(C) }frac{ax+by}{xy} qquad textbf{(D) }frac{ay+bx}{x+y} qquad textbf{(E) }frac{xy}{x+y}","completion":"1. **Rewrite the expression using positive exponents**: [ (ax^{-1} + by^{-1})^{-1} = left(frac{a}{x} + frac{b}{y}right)^{-1} ] Here, ax^{-1} and by^{-1} are rewritten as frac{a}{x} and frac{b}{y} respectively. 2. **Combine the fractions inside the parentheses**: [ frac{a}{x} + frac{b}{y} = frac{ay}{xy} + frac{bx}{xy} = frac{ay + bx}{xy} ] We find a common denominator, xy, and then add the numerators, which are ay and bx. 3. **Take the reciprocal of the combined fraction**: [ left(frac{ay + bx}{xy}right)^{-1} = frac{xy}{ay + bx} ] The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping the numerator and the denominator. 4. **Conclude with the final simplified expression**: [ frac{xy{ay + bx}} ] This results in a fraction where xy is the numerator and the sum ay + bx is in the denominator.

Pipe C fills the pool in 5 hours, so its rate is 1/5 of the pool per hour. The combined rate of the three pipes without any hindrance would be: (1/10) + (1/6) + (1/5) = (3/30) + (5/30) + (6/30) = 14/30 = 7/15 of the pool per hour.

For x leq -3, we have fleft(xright) = -(x-1)-(x+3) = -2x-2. 2. For -3 < x < 1, we have fleft(xright) = -(x-1)+(x+3) = 4. 3. For x geq 1, we have fleft(xright) = (x-1)+(x+3) = 2x+2. Now, we solve the inequality fleft(xright)geqslant 6 in each interval: - For x leq -3, solving -2x-2 geqslant 6 gives x leq -4. - For -3 < x < 1, the inequality 4 geqslant 6 does not hold, so there are no solutions in this interval. - For x geq 1, solving 2x+2 geqslant 6 gives x geq 2.

Find the probability that every square, occupied or not, is attacked by some knight.","completion":"To determine the probability that every square on a chessboard is attacked by at least one knight when eight knights are randomly placed on the board, we need to consider the movement of knights and the constraints of attacking all squares. 1. **Knight's Movement**: A knight in chess moves in an \\"L\\" shape: - Two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to it, or - One square in one direction and two squares perpendicular to it. Consequently, each knight can potentially attack up to 8 unique squares around its current position. 2. **Coverage of all Squares**: To ensure that every square on the chessboard is attacked by at least one knight, we need to place the knights in such a way that their combined attack range covers all 64 squares. 3. **Maximum Attack Range**: As stated, each knight can attack up to 8 squares. However, this is the maximum attack range in an optimal central position. Placement on the edges or corners of the board results in fewer squares being attacked because part of the attack range would lie outside the boundaries of the board. 4. **Corners Case Analysis**: Let's analyze the corner squares specifically: - Suppose a knight is placed so that it can attack a corner square. The movement of the knight required to attack a corner significantly limits the number of additional squares it can cover. Experimentation shows the following: - A knight in any of the four center squares of the 3x3 grid at each corner will attack the corner as well as surrounding squares. - However, regardless of where the knight is placed within this 3x3 grid around the corners, it will never attack more than a few (maximally up to 5-6 squares) given the board's constraints, far less than 8. 5. **All Corners Versus Central Position**: - Even placing eight knights in theoretically optimal, centralized positions fails to cover all squares adequately. - Given the need to cover each square at least once, and recognizing every placement constraint, achieving this with the distribution of knights becomes practically impossible. 6. **Conclusion**: The best placement of 8 knights, each attacking at most 8 squares, cannot cover all 64 squares. The corners themselves pose a specific challenge providing conclusive evidence that no such arrangement suffices to ensure full board coverage.

Given that in triangle ABC, 0 < C < pi, we conclude that C = frac{2pi}{3}, which means the measure of angle C is boxed{frac{2pi}{3}}. (Ⅱ) Because the triangle's area S = frac{1}{2}absin C = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}c, we have c = frac{1}{2}ab. Also, c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos C = a^2 + b^2 + ab because cos C = -frac{1}{2}. Taking into consideration that a = b, we set a = b = x. From c^2 = x^2 + x^2 + x^2, we can solve for x: 3x^2 = c^2, x^2 = frac{c^2}{3}, x = frac{c}{sqrt{3}}.

First, let's convert the speed of the bus from km/h to cm/min: 66 km/h = 66,000 meters/hour = 66,000,000 cm/hour Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide by 60 to get the speed in cm/minute: 66,000,000 cm/hour ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 1,100,000 cm/minute Now, we need to find the circumference of the wheel, which is the distance the wheel covers in one complete revolution. The formula for the circumference (C) of a circle is: C = 2 * π * r where r is the radius of the wheel.

Hence, the total number of such 20-letter words can be calculated as follows: [ 3 times 2^{19} ] This formula arises because the first letter is chosen from 3 possibilities and each of the remaining 19 letters is chosen from 2 possibilities due to the restriction of not repeating the previous letter. 2. **Words with Only Two Letters**: Next, we must exclude the words that use only two out of the three available letters. Such words do not contain at least one of the letters А, Б, or В. - Words using only А and Б: [ 2 times 2^{18} ] - Words using only А and В: [ 2 times 2^{18} ] - Words using only Б and В: [ 2 times 2^{18} ] Since each pair of letters generates the same amount of invalid words, we sum these contributions: [ 2^{20} + 2^{20} + 2^{20} = 3 times 2^{18} ] 3. **Final Calculation**: We subtract the invalid words from the total number of combinations to find the number of valid 20-letter words: [ 3 times 2^{19} - 3 times 2^{18} ] Notice that: [ 2^{19} = 2 times 2^{18} ] Therefore: [ 3 times 2 times 2^{18} - 3 times 2^{18} = 3 times 2^{18} times (2 - 1) = 3 times 2^{18} ] 4. **Final Answer**: Calculating ( 3 times 2^{18} ): [ 3 times 2^{18} = 3 times 262144 = 786432 ] Summarizing, the total number of valid 20-letter words is: [ boxed{1572858} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the integer m, 180 < m < 180, such that tan m^circ = tan 405^circ.","completion":"Given the periodicity of the tangent function, which is 180^circ, we need to find an angle equivalent to 405^circ that lies within the range -180^circ < m < 180^circ.

According to the problem, when n is divided by d, the remainder is 3. This can be written as: n = kd + 3 where k is some integer. Now, we are told that when n^2 is divided by d, the remainder is 4. We can square the first equation to get n^2: n^2 = (kd + 3)^2 n^2 = k^2d^2 + 6kd + 9 When n^2 is divided by d, the terms k^2d^2 and 6kd will not leave a remainder since they are multiples of d. The remainder will come from the constant term, which is 9. So, we have: n^2 = (some integer) * d + 9 But we are told that the remainder is 4, not 9. This means that 9 must be reduced by a multiple of d to get to 4. The smallest such multiple is 5 (since 9 - 5 = 4), and 5 is less than d (because the remainder must be less than the divisor). Therefore, d must be 5. To confirm, let's check: - When n is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. This means n could be 3, 8, 13, 18, etc. - When n^2 is divided by 5, the remainder is 4. If n is 3, then n^2 is 9, and the remainder when 9 is divided by 5 is indeed 4. If n is 8, then n^2 is 64, and the remainder when 64 is divided by 5 is also 4.

We check: [ 3^2 = 9, quad 5^2 - 4 = 25 - 9 = 16 ] and we find ( z = 4 ). This gives a viable solution: [ (x, y, z) = (2, 2, 4) ] 5. **Using Zsigmondy's Theorem:** According to Zsigmondy's theorem, if ( a geq 3 ), ( 3^a + 1 ) has a prime divisor ( p ) that does not divide ( 3^2 + 1 = 10 ), which implies that ( p neq 2, 5 ).

We need to determine the possible mutual position of the lines ( f, g, ) and ( h ). 2. **Choosing a Point on ( f ):** Select a point on the line ( f ) that does not lie on ( g ) or ( h ). This is possible since ( f, g, ) and ( h ) are distinct lines in space. 3. **Choosing Points on ( g ):** Similarly, choose two points on the line ( g ) that do not lie on ( f ) or ( h ). Let these points be ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ). 4. **Intersection with ( h ):** Consider the lines ( fP_1 ) and ( fP_2 ), where each line is defined by a chosen point on ( f ) and one of the points ( P_1 ) or ( P_2 ) on ( g ). According to the problem, these lines must intersect ( h ). 5. **Defining a Plane:** The lines ( fP_1 ) and ( fP_2 ) span a plane. Since both of these lines intersect ( h ), the line ( h ) must lie in this plane. 6. **Conclusion About the Plane:** Since ( g ) passes through the points ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ), and both points define lines intersecting ( h ), ( g ) must also lie in the same plane as ( h ). Consequently, ( f ) must lie in the same plane as well, because if ( f ) were not in this plane, there would exist a line ( e ) not able to intersect both ( g ) and ( h ) simultaneously, contradicting the given condition. 7. **Checking Parallelism:** Assume ( f ) and ( g ) intersect at a point. Let’s take a point outside this plane and consider the line ( e ) passing through this point and the intersection point of ( f ) and ( g ). Since this line ( e ) would not be able to intersect ( h ) unless the intersection point is also on ( h ), it implies that ( f, g, ) and ( h ) must be parallel or must intersect at a common point. 8. **Final Check for Parallelism:** If ( h ) is not parallel to ( f ), then taking a line ( e ) in the plane formed by ( f, g, h ) and parallel to ( h ). This line ( e ) intersects ( f ) and ( g ) but not ( h ), contradicting the given condition. Thus, ( h ) must be parallel to ( f ), and an analogous argument shows that ( f ) must be parallel to ( g ) as well. # Conclusion: The lines ( f, g ), and ( h ) must lie in the same plane and be parallel to each other.

This means that the third number must have a factor that requires the LCM to double from 70 to 140. The prime factorization of 140 is 2 x 2 x 5 x 7. We already have 2, 5, and 7 from 10 and 14, so the third number must contribute another factor of 2 to the LCM to make it 140. Therefore, the third number must be a multiple of 2 but not a multiple of 5 or 7 (since that would increase the LCM beyond 140). The smallest such number is 2 itself. However, since we are looking for the LCM to be 140 and 2 is already a factor in both 10 and 14, the third number must be a multiple of 2 that is not already a factor in 10 or 14 and does not introduce any new prime factors.

For the sequence {b_n}, for any n, m∈ℕ^∗, since b_{n+m}=4^{n+m}=4^n•4^m=b_n•b_m, {b_n} is an exponential sequence. (II) Proof: According to the problem, {frac{1}{a_n}+1} is an \\"exponential sequence\\". a_n=2a_na_{n+1}+3a_{n+1} ⇒ frac{1}{a_{n+1}}=frac{3}{a_n}+2 ⇒ frac{1}{a_{n+1}}+1=3(frac{1}{a_n}+1), so the sequence {frac{1}{a_n}+1} is a geometric sequence. frac{1}{a_n}+1=(frac{1}{a_n}+1)×3^{n-1}=3^n, (frac{1}{a_n}+1)(frac{1}{a_m}+1)=3^n⋅3^m=3^{m+n}=(frac{1}{a_{n+m}}+1), so the sequence {frac{1}{a_n}+1} is an \\"exponential sequence\\".

Assume that there are three terms a_u, a_v, a_w in the sequence {a_n} that form an arithmetic sequence, without loss of generality, let u<v<w.

When t is even, 2(a+2)^{w-v}(a+1)^{v-u} is even, while (a+2)^{w-u} is even and (a+1)^{w-u} is odd, so 2(a+2)^{w-v}(a+1)^{v-u}=(a+2)^{w-u}+(a+1)^{w-u} cannot hold.

We need to determine which dots Devah erases based on the midpoint condition. 2. **Observation of Patterns**: We observe that certain sequences of dots are kept, such as (0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40, ldots). These sequences suggest a pattern related to the base-3 representation of the numbers. 3. **Base-3 Representation**: We hypothesize that a dot labeled with the integer (n) is kept if and only if its base-3 representation contains no digit '2'. 4. **Proof by Induction**: - **Base Case**: For small values, we manually verify that the dots labeled (0, 1, 3, 4) (which are (0_3, 1_3, 10_3, 11_3)) are kept, and they contain no '2' in their base-3 representation. - **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for all (t < N). Consider the dot labeled (N). If (N) contains a '2' in its base-3 representation, we can find two kept dots (t_1) and (t_2) such that (t_1 < t_2) and the midpoint between (t_1) and (t_2) is (N). This is because the digit '2' in (N) ensures that there is a position where (t_1) and (t_2) differ, and the arithmetic sequence condition forces (N) to be erased. 5. **Counting the Kept Dots**: - We need to count the number of integers from (0) to (999) whose base-3 representation does not contain the digit '2'. - The largest number in base-3 within this range is (999_{10} = 1101000_3). 6. **Counting Valid Base-3 Numbers**: - We count the numbers with no '2' in their base-3 representation up to (1101000_3). - Each digit can be either '0' or '1'. For a 7-digit number in base-3, there are (2^7 = 128) such numbers. - However, we need to consider numbers up to (999), which is (1101000_3). We count the valid numbers up to (104_{10}) (since (1101000_3 = 104_{10})). 7. **Final Calculation**: - There are (105) valid numbers (including (0)) that do not contain '2' in their base-3 representation. - Therefore, the number of dots that Devah erases is (1000 - 105 = 895).

This implies that ( Z ) has at least as many neighbors as ( X ), so ( Z ) also has maximal degree. 4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Argument**: - Using BFS, we can show that every vertex in the graph has the same degree. - Start from a vertex with maximal degree and explore its neighbors.

For finding the intervals where f(x) is monotonically increasing, we look into the derivative f'(x) which implies looking at sin 2x. From the periodicity and nature of sin 2x, we derive the given condition: 2kπ-frac{π}{2}⩽2x⩽2kπ+frac{π}{2} quad (kin Z) Simplifying this condition gives us the intervals of monotonic increase: kπ-frac{π}{4}⩽x⩽kπ+frac{π}{4} quad (kin Z). Therefore, the monotonically increasing interval of f(x) is [kπ-frac{π}{4}, kπ+frac{π}{4}] quad (kin Z). For the center of symmetry, setting 2x = kπ where kin Z, we find x=frac{kπ}{2} quad (kin Z).

According to the problem, the allowed maximum height to serve is 168 cm. 1. **Analyze Team A:** - The average height of the sailors is 166 cm. - An example given: Three sailors with heights of 160 cm, 169 cm, and 169 cm. [ text{Average height} = frac{160 + 169 + 169}{3} = frac{498}{3} = 166 text{ cm} ] - Out of these, only one sailor (160 cm) is eligible (height ≤ 168 cm). - Therefore, at least half of the sailors in Team A may not be eligible due to having one eligible sailor out of three. 2. **Analyze Team B:** - The median height of sailors is 167 cm. - By definition, the median is the middle value when the heights are ordered. - This means at least half the sailors are 167 cm or shorter. - Consequently, at least half of the sailors can serve on the submarine as their heights do not exceed 168 cm. - If there are more sailors shorter than or equal to 167 cm, they are also eligible. 3. **Analyze Team C:** - The tallest sailor has a height of 169 cm. - Whether there are more sailors or their other heights are not mentioned explicitly within the acceptable range. - An example provided: Two sailors both with heights of 169 cm. - If all sailors have heights of 169 cm, none would be eligible. - Thus, this team does not give a clear indication that at least half can serve. 4. **Analyze Team D:** - The mode height of the sailors is 167 cm. - This means 167 cm is the most frequent height among the sailors. - Example: Five sailors with heights 167 cm, 167 cm, 169 cm, 170 cm, and 171 cm. - Out of these, only two sailors (167 cm) are eligible. - Hence, less than half might be eligible due to having three out of five exceeding the height limit. # Conclusion: By the height constraints for serving on the submarine (height ≤ 168 cm), Team B is identified as the only team where at least half of the sailors can serve since the median height ensures at least half of them do not exceed 167 cm.

Consider the triangle ( triangle ABC ) with ( M ) being the midpoint of side ( BC ) and ( O ) being the center of the inscribed circle of the triangle. 2. Line ( MO ) is drawn, which intersects the altitude ( AH ) at point ( E ). 3. We need to prove that the length of segment ( AE ) is equal to the radius of the inscribed circle. # Proof: 1. **Define Key Points and Distance Relations:** Let ( F ) be the tangency point of the inscribed circle with side ( BC ). Additionally, consider the excircle opposite vertex ( A ), which is tangent to ( BC ) at point ( Q ), and let the excircle extend to meet the extensions of ( AB ) and ( AC ) at points ( K ) and ( L ) respectively. The radius of the exradius opposite ( A ) is denoted by ( r_A ). 2. **Semi-perimeter Formulation:** Let ( p ) be the semi-perimeter of ( triangle ABC ). - By the definition of the exradius and the semi-perimeter, we have that: [ BQ = BK = p - AB ] - Similarly, because ( F ) is the tangency point of the inscribed circle at side ( BC ): [ CF = p - AC ] 3. **Midpoint and Segment Proportions:** - Since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( BC ), we can express distances as: [ QM = BM - BQ = frac{BC}{2} - (p - AB) ] - Substituting ( CF = QM ), we find: [ MF = CM - CF = frac{BC}{2} - (p - AC) ] 4. **Homothety with Respect to Inscribed Circle:** - Under the homothety with center ( A ) where the exradius ( S ) of ( triangle ABC ) is mapped to the incircle, the line ( BC ) maps to a parallel line tangent to the incircle at some point ( P ). Points ( A ), ( P ), and ( Q ) must be collinear in this setup. 5. **Constructing the Parallelogram:** - Because ( M ) is the midpoint of segment ( QF ) and ( MO ) serves as a mid-segment, ( MO parallel AP ) and ( M ) lies at the midpoint of segment ( QF ). - Thus, both ( P ) and ( F ) align such that ( E ) lies on line ( MO ), making ( AP parallel MO ) and since they are midlines of ( triangle QFP ): [ PO and AE parallel ] - Since ( PF perp BC ) and ( AH perp BC ), it implies: [ OP parallel AE quad text{and} quad OPAE quad text{forms a parallelogram} ] 6. **Conclusion:** - From the properties of the parallelogram formed: [ AE = OP = OF ] - Since ( OF ) is the radius ( r ) of the inscribed circle of ( triangle ABC ).

Let's first consider the case when (y = 1): [ 2x(1)^2 - (1)^3 + 1 = 2x - 1 + 1 = 2x ] So, we need (x^2 mid 2x). This implies (x mid 2). Since (x) is a positive integer, (x) can be 1 or 2. Therefore, the pairs ((x, y)) are: [ (1, 1) quad text{and} quad (2, 1) ] 3.

Thus, if circle M has the center at (-2, -2), the center of circle C would be at (2, 2) after applying the reflection. Since the radii of the circles are the same due to symmetry, the equation of circle C will have the same radius r. The equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2.

Therefore T^prime lies on line AA^prime, and the tangent to omega^prime at T^prime is also parallel to BC. 5. **Tangent Properties:** - Since omega^prime lies above this tangent line, the tangent line which is BC means T^prime is on BC. Therefore, omega^prime touches BC at point A^prime. 6. **Calculation Involving the Semiperimeter:** - Denote the semiperimeter of triangle XYZ as p. - Since omega and omega^prime are excircles for this triangle, we have: [ ZA' = YA'' = p - YZ ] - Therefore, [ XY + XZ = 2p - YZ ] - Simplifying, we get: [ XY + XZ = Z A^prime + YZ + YA^{primeprime} = A^prime A^{primeprime} ] 7. **Conclusion:** - The sum XY + XZ is thus equal to the length A^prime A^{primeprime}, which does not depend on the choice of point X. # Conclusion: [ boxed{XY + XZ text{ does not depend on the choice of point } X.} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that alpha is an angle in the first quadrant, and cos alpha = dfrac{5}{13}, find the value of dfrac{sin left(alpha dfrac{pi}{4}right)}{cos left(2alpha + 3pi right)}.

But since the rectangle induces different spacing, we note that this is not equal-lateral; rather it's a 45-degree isosceles right triangle.

This is a multivariate polynomial in ( z_1, ldots, z_n ). 2. **Homogeneity and divisibility:** By the properties of determinants, ( f ) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree ( n ). Given that ( sum_{i=1}^n alpha_i A_i ) is singular whenever at least one ( alpha_i = 0 ), it follows that ( f(z_1, ldots, z_n) ) is divisible by each ( z_i ). Therefore, we can write: [ f(z_1, ldots, z_n) = a prod_{i=1}^n z_i ] for some real constant ( a ). 3. **Non-zero constant:** Since ( sum_{i=1}^n A_i = I ), we have ( f(1, ldots, 1) = det(I) = 1 ).

Suppose ( A_i = 0 ) for some ( i ). Then choose ( alpha_j = 1 ) for all ( j neq i ) and first ( alpha_i = 0 ), then ( alpha_i = 1 ). By the hypothesis and part (a), ( f(alpha_1, ldots, alpha_n) ) is both zero and nonzero, which is a contradiction. - Therefore, ( A_i neq 0 ). 4. **Conclusion for part (b):** - By the lemma, ( text{tr}(A_i) = text{rank}(A_i) ) and ( text{tr}left(sum_{j neq i} A_jright) = text{rank}left(sum_{j neq i} A_jright) ). - Since ( sum_{j neq i} A_j ) is not invertible, ( text{rank}left(sum_{j neq i} A_jright) leq n - 1 ). - Therefore, ( sum_{j neq i} text{rank}(A_j) leq n - 1 ). - Given that ( sum_{i=1}^n A_i = I ), we have ( text{rank}(A_i) = 1 ) for all ( i ).

The problem states that any selection of 85 trees will necessarily contain all four types of trees. 2. **Analyze Minimum Requirements**: First, consider if we assume there are no more than 15 trees of one type, say birches. Then, the remaining 100 - 15 = 85 trees must contain all four tree types, according to the problem statement. This would form a contradiction if there were less than 15 birches, implying that there must be at least 16 birches. This logic applies symmetrically to the other types of trees (spruces, pines, aspens). 3. **Illustrate General Conclusion**: Every type of tree (birches, spruces, pines, aspens) must be represented by at least 16 trees. So, in any subset of 85 trees, each type definitely appears. 4. **Bound the Calculation for Three Types**: Now, let’s determine the least number such that among any 69 chosen trees, there are always at least three different types of trees. 5. **Consider Contradiction Approach**: Assume the chosen subset of 69 trees contains only two types of trees. Then, at least 100 - 69 = 31 trees are not part of this subset. These 31 trees must include at least 16 trees of each of the remaining two types. This gives rise to a contradiction because removing trees belonging to at least two types leaves enough for ensuring all four types in remaining trees. Thus, every possible set of 69 trees must contain more than two types of trees. 6. **Example for Counterverification**: To verify, consider 34 birches, 34 spruces, 16 pines, and 16 aspens: - In any subset of 85, all four types are present. - However, if we take 34 birches and 34 spruces, the subset of these 68 trees consists only of two types (birches and spruces).

We need to prove that at least one of the sets (S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{2^n}) contains no more than (4n) elements. 2. **Define the weight function (W(i, j)):** Let (L_i = |S_i|) and (a_{i,j}) be the (j)-th element of (S_i) in increasing order. Define a weight (W(i, j)) for every (1 leq i leq 2^n) and (0 leq j leq L_i) as follows: [ W(i, 0) = W(i, 1) = 0 ] For (j > 1), consider (T = {t mid a_{i,j} in S_t, t leq i}). Let (T = {t_1, t_2, ldots, t_u}) where (t_1 < t_2 < ldots < t_u = i). Let (a_{i,j}) be the (q_k)-th element of (S_{t_k}), i.e., (a_{i,j} = a_{t_k, q_k}). Set [ W(i, j) = 1 + sum_k W(t_k, q_k - 1) ] 3. **Claim and proof of the weight function bound:** **Claim:** We have (W(i, j) leq max(0, a_{i,j} - a_{i,2} + 1)) for all (i, j). **Proof:** This is trivially true for (j < 2), so assume (j geq 2). Consider (T = {t mid a_{i,j} in S_t, t leq i}). Let (T = {t_1, t_2, ldots, t_u}) where (t_1 < t_2 < ldots < t_u = i) and let (q_k) be the position of (a_{i,j}) in (S_{t_k}). By the definition of (W), [ W(i, j) = 1 + sum W(t_k, q_k - 1) ] By induction (on (a_{i,j})), we have (W(t_k, q_k - 1) leq max(a_{t_k, q_k - 1} - a_{t_k, 2} + 1, 0)) for all (k). Thus, it suffices to show [ sum max(a_{t_k, q_k - 1} - a_{t_k, 2} + 1, 0) leq a_{i,j} - a_{i,2} ] We only need to consider the above sum for those (k) for which (q_k > 2). Let (U = {k mid k leq |T|, q_k > 2}). Consider any two indices (p, r in U) with (p < r). Note that the given condition implies that the interval ([a_{t_p, 1}, a_{t_p, q_p - 1}]) is contained in the interval ([a_{t_r, q_r - 1}, a_{t_r, q_r}]) (otherwise we would have a contradiction: (a_{t_p, 1}, a_{i,j} in S_{t_p}, a_{t_r, q_r - 1}, a_{i,j} in S_{t_r}, t_p < t_r, a_{t_p, 1} < a_{t_r, q_r - 1} < a_{i,j} = a_{t_r, q_r} = a_{t_p, q_p})). This is the only place in the proof where we use the given condition. Thus, ([a_{t_p, 2}, a_{t_p, q_p - 1}]) is a proper subinterval of ([a_{t_r, q_r - 1}, a_{t_r, q_r}]). So the intervals ([a_{t_k, 2}, a_{t_k, q_k - 1}]) for (k in U) don't intersect with each other and are all contained in ([a_{i, 2}, a_{i, j} - 1]).

So, there are at most (n + 3) indices (j) such that ((i, a_{i, j})) is non-beautiful. 7. **Claim and proof of the bound on beautiful pairs:** **Claim:** For any (x), there can be at most (n + 2) values of (i) such that ((i, x)) is beautiful. **Proof:** Assume otherwise, let (t_1 < cdots < t_{n+3}) be such that ((t_1, x), cdots, (t_{n+3}, x)) are all beautiful. Let (x) be the (q_i)-th element of (t_i). By assumption (q_i > 2). We have [ W(t_i, q_i) leq 2 W(t_i, q_{i} - 1) implies 1 + sum_{j leq i} W(t_j, q_j - 1) leq 2 W(t_i, q_i - 1) implies W(t_i, q_i - 1) geq 1 + sum_{j < i} W(t_j, q_j - 1) ] Now, [ W(t_1, q_1 - 1) geq 1 implies W(t_2, q_2 - 1) geq 2 implies W(t_3, q_3 - 1) geq 4 implies W(t_4, q_4 - 1) geq 8 implies cdots ] By easy induction, (W(t_i, q_i - 1) geq 2^{i - 1}).

Cover the entire board with 1 times 2 dominoes, leaving one corner uncovered, for example, (1, 1). 4. Select an initial domino that covers one of the corners of the board, say the corner at (1, 1), and label one of its squares 1 and the other 2. 5. Consider the neighbors of these labels, for instance, an asterisk (*) to denote a square that is directly adjacent to the labeled square but does not share any vertex with the square labeled 1. 6. If the asterisked square is not already the uncovered corner, it must be covered by some domino. Denote this neighboring domino and label its squares similarly with 1 and 2 corresponding to the previously established domino. 7. Repeat this process recursively: label the squares of the domino adjacent to the newest domino in the manner described until you encounter the empty corner. This recursive procedure ensures that all dominoes are accounted for uniquely along a path that terminates at the uncovered corner. 8. If at any step, every domino has a pair, continue creating the chain of dominoes until a domino recurs in the chain, forming a loop. 9. Enclose such loops within a minimal rectangle aligned parallel to the edges of the chessboard. The area of such rectangles will have both side lengths odd, since they match the parity properties of the board. 10. Calculate the area of these rectangles; hence, the collective area (in squares) will be odd because the product of two odd numbers is odd. On removing the area covered by domino groups, it's evident that the remaining part covered by the initial chain will also be odd. 11. Realize that since every domino covers 2 squares, a contradiction arises if the remaining part is not matched properly aligning the odd area theory. Hence, some uncovered part exists. 12.

Each scenario has 1 times 6 times 6 = 36 outcomes, but since rolling a 1 on any two dice would be counted twice, and all three being 1 is counted three times, we need to subtract these overlaps. There are 3 times 5 times 5 = 75 outcomes with no 1s. So, number of outcomes for at least one 1 is 216 - 75 = 141. Next, calculate the conditional probabilities: - P(A|B): The probability that the three numbers are all different given that at least one die shows a 1. We need to count how many outcomes satisfy both A and B. Since we already have one die showing a 1, there are 5 possibilities for the second die and 4 possibilities for the third die, leading to 5 times 4 = 20 outcomes for each scenario of getting a 1. There are 3 scenarios where a single die shows a 1, so there are 20 times 3 = 60 outcomes satisfying both A and B. Hence, P(A|B) = frac{60}{141}. - P(B|A): The probability that at least one die shows a 1 given that the three numbers are all different. We know that when the three numbers are all different (120 outcomes), there are 60 outcomes with at least one 1 (since 1 can take any of the three different positions).

Since half of the 80 cupcakes are gluten-free, there are: 80 / 2 = 40 gluten-free cupcakes. We know there are 24 vegan cupcakes, and some of these are gluten-free. We also know there are 28 non-vegan cupcakes that contain gluten. Since these 28 are not gluten-free, they are not part of the 40 gluten-free cupcakes. To find out how many vegan cupcakes are gluten-free, we can subtract the non-vegan gluten cupcakes from the total gluten-free cupcakes: 40 (gluten-free cupcakes) - 28 (non-vegan gluten cupcakes) = 12 vegan gluten-free cupcakes. Now we have the number of vegan gluten-free cupcakes (12) and the total number of vegan cupcakes (24). To find the ratio of vegan gluten-free cupcakes to the total number of vegan cupcakes, we divide the number of vegan gluten-free cupcakes by the total number of vegan cupcakes: 12 (vegan gluten-free cupcakes) / 24 (total vegan cupcakes) = 1/2.

Since a+b=2, we can substitute this value into the inequality, resulting in 2sqrt{3a+1}cdot sqrt{3b+1}leqslant 8.

Examining the binomial coefficients, we recall that for any binomial expansion (a + b)^n, the binomial coefficients follow a symmetry such that C_n^r = C_n^{n-r}. This symmetry implies that the 5th and 6th terms' binomial coefficients are equal due to their positions being symmetrical around the midpoint of the expansion. Thus, the claim that the 6th and 7th terms' coefficients are equal misunderstands this symmetry, making option A incorrect. For the sum of binomial coefficients, any (a + b)^n expansion's coefficients sum to 2^n.

A constant term arises when the exponent of x is 0, so we set 9-frac{3}{2}r = 0 and solve for r to get r = 6. Therefore, the constant term is given by C_9^6 = C_9^3 = 84, confirming option C as boxed{C}.

Since this is a transcendental equation (an equation involving transcendental functions), it's often not easily solvable by algebraic methods. Instead, let's investigate the behavior of the functions visually and analytically. First, consider the function g(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4. This is a quadratic with a vertex form of (x - 2)^2, implying the vertex of the parabola is at (2, 0) and it opens upwards since the coefficient of x^2 is positive. Now, the function f(x) = ln x is a logarithmic function, which has a vertical asymptote at x = 0 and increases without bound as x approaches infinity. However, it increases much slower than any polynomial function after a certain point. Given that the vertex of g(x) is at (2, 0) and the parabola opens upwards, while the logarithmic function passes through (1, 0) and increases slowly, we can deduce that the two graphs must intersect at two points: close to the y-axis where the logarithmic function starts increasing from -infty and crosses the parabola before it reaches its vertex, and on the right side where x > 2, as the parabola grows faster than the logarithm.

However, we can notice that the left side of the equation is a constant value, and the right side is a linear function of m. Since we are given that the equation equals 547864, we can deduce that the left side must also equal 547864 when m is the correct value. Therefore, we can set the left side equal to 547864 and solve for m: 547864 = 314 - m Now, we solve for m: m = 314 - 547864 m = -547550 So, the value of m is boxed{-547550} ."},{"prompt":"Square C has side lengths each measuring y meters.

Given that the focus F is at (2, 0) and the directrix is at x = -2, the distance between the focus and the directrix is 2 - (-2) = 4.

The center of this circle is obtained by completing the square for x and y terms, but since there's no x term that shifts the center horizontally, the center is directly on the y-axis, thus at (0,a). The constant term in the circle's equation helps us find the radius. The general form of a circle's equation is (x-h)^{2}+(y-k)^{2}=r^{2}, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. Comparing this with our circle's equation, we see that the radius squared, r^{2}, must account for both the -2ay term and the constant term -2. Thus, we have r^{2} = a^{2} + 2 after moving all terms to one side and completing the square for the y term, which gives us the radius as sqrt{a^{2}+2}. Given that the line y=x+2a intersects the circle at points A and B with a distance |AB|=2sqrt{3}, we can use the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the line to find a relationship involving a. The distance d from a point (x_0,y_0) to a line Ax+By+C=0 is given by d=frac{|Ax_0+By_0+C|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. Applying this formula to our scenario where the center of the circle is (0,a) and the line is y=x+2a (which can be rewritten as -x+y-2a=0 for clarity), we find that d=frac{|-0+a-2a|}{sqrt{(-1)^2+(1)^2}}=frac{|-a|}{sqrt{2}}=sqrt{a^{2}-1}, given the geometric relationship between the radius, the distance d, and half the chord length |AB|/2. Solving frac{|a|}{sqrt{2}}=sqrt{a^{2}-1}, we square both sides to eliminate the square root, leading to frac{a^{2}}{2}=a^{2}-1. Rearranging terms gives us a^{2}=2. Knowing a^{2}=2, we substitute back into our expression for the radius r=sqrt{a^{2}+2} to find r=sqrt{2+2}=sqrt{4}=2. Finally, the area S of a circle with radius r is given by S=pi r^{2}.

How many distinct arrangements are possible?","completion":"The shortest path from (A) to (B) in a 6 by 5 grid requires (5) movements to the right and (4) movements down using dominoes. Since each domino covers two squares, we need exactly five dominoes, the exact number provided. We need to cover a total path length of (5+4=9) squares, which can be achieved by arranging dominoes in sequences of right and down movements. We calculate the number of distinct arrangements by choosing five movements right out of the total nine movements (or equivalently, four movements down out of nine). This is given by: [ binom{9}{5} = binom{9}{4} ] Calculating this, we have: [ binom{9}{4} = frac{9 times 8 times 7 times 6}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 126 ] Thus, there are (boxed{126}) distinct arrangements possible."},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, angle ACB is 60 degrees, and angle CBA is 70 degrees.

Let BD = x. This implies DC = 1 - x. We then have: - CE = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x because CE is derived from the fact that E divides CA based on the 30-degree angle and the properties of the inscribed equilateral triangle. - BF = 1 - frac{x}{2} because BF extends partly along AB.

From point P, draw tangents t_1 and t_2 to the circle, touching the circle at points T_1 and T_2 respectively. Let the angle bisectors of the angles formed between the tangents and line e be denoted as f_1 and f_2. 2. **Projection on Angle Bisector f_1 and Geometry Analysis:** - Let M be the foot of the perpendicular from the center O to the angle bisector f_1. - Let M_1 be the projection of M onto the line e. - Similarly, let M_2 be the projection of M onto the tangent t_1. By construction, the distances are equal: M M_1 = M M_2. 3. **Parallel Tangents and Geometric Relationships:** - Let g be the tangent to the circle parallel to line e on the same side as point M. - This tangent g touches the circle at point O' such that (OO' perp e). 4. **Angle Bisector Theorem Application:** - Consider triangles OOP and OMT_1. - By geometric properties and symmetries, angle O'OT_1 = angle OPM since the sides of these triangles are perpendicular. - Thus, line OM bisects angle O'O T_1 . 5. **Perpendicular Distances and Equalities:** - Point M is equidistant from lines t_1 and g, confirming that M lies on a line parallel to e. - Therefore, MM_{1} = MM_{3} where M_{3} is the projection of M on g. - As MM_{3} perp g and g parallel e, it follows MM_{3} perp e. Thus, the distance from M to e is constant and equals frac{r}{2}. 6. **Exploration of Various Positions of P:** - If P is at point A on e such that OA = r, the tangent PT_1 is perpendicular to e. - Let M' be the projection of O on the angle bisector in this setup. Since angle OM'A = 45^circ, M''s distance from e is frac{r}{2}. - As P approaches infinity along e, the bisector angle reduces to 0, making M approach the midpoint of OO', and so on. 7. **Summary of the Geometric Loci:** - Therefore, as P moves along e, point M traces out a line parallel to e and at a distance frac{r}{2} from it. - These positions are a segment of the line d_1 parallel to e at the requisite distance. 8. **Considering Second Angle Bisector f_2:** - Define point N as the projection of O on angle bisector f_2. - The same distance argument applies, so N also traces out a parallel line to e at distance frac{r}{2}, referred to as d_2, symmetric to d_1 about e. 9. **Complete Geometric Locus:** - Combining all the described segments, the total geometric locus of the projections of O onto the angle bisectors f_1 and f_2 as P moves along e forms two parallel lines d_1 and d_2. - Point M describes one part while point N describes the symmetric counterpart. # Conclusion: The geometric locus of the feet of the perpendiculars from the center O of the circle to the angle bisectors of the angles between the tangents from point P and the line e is a pair of parallel lines.

For any letter (X), let ( text{pos}(X) ) denote its position in the alphabet. 3. **Summing sequences:** When we sum two sequences of letters, each position in the resulting sequence is determined by the combined sum of corresponding letters from the original sequences.

Having distinct sums results in these positions potentially overlapping, which violates the distinctness condition by programs of positional addition modulo properties. 9. **Conclusion:** This contradiction implies it is impossible to have two alphabet sequences each of 26 letters sum to yield a sequence of 26 unique letters.

This line intersects the ellipse at two points. Now, we have to find M cap N, which consists of the points that lie on both the ellipse and the line. Solving the equations simultaneously: From the line equation frac{x}{3} + frac{y}{2} = 1, we express x in terms of y: x = 3 - frac{3y}{2}. Substitute x into the ellipse equation: left(frac{(3 - frac{3y}{2})^2}{9}right) + frac{y^2}{4} = 1.

Since Gamma is both the incircle of triangle ABC and the circumcircle of triangle XYZ, we can infer certain properties about the angles of triangle XYZ based on its relationship with triangle ABC. 2. **Identifying the Isosceles Triangle**: The key observation here is that triangle BYX is isosceles, as it is inscribed in circle Gamma and shares a common angle at B. Given that Gamma is the incircle of triangle ABC, it touches overline{BC}, overline{AB}, and overline{AC} at points X, Y, and Z respectively, implying that angle BYX and angle BXY are equal. Furthermore, since angle B = 60^circ, and Gamma is also the circumcircle of triangle XYZ, triangle BYX turns out to be equilateral, making all its internal angles equal to 60^circ. 3. **Calculating angle AYX**: Knowing that triangle BYX is equilateral and thus angle BYX = 60^circ, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in triangle AYB equals 180^circ. Therefore, we have: [ 180^circ = angle AYB = angle AYX + angle BYX ] Substituting the known values, we get: [ 180^circ = angle AYX + 60^circ ] Solving for angle AYX, we find: [ angle AYX = 180^circ - 60^circ = 120^circ ] Therefore, the measure of angle AYX is boxed{120^circ}."},{"prompt":"the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, if the fixed point A(1,2) and the moving point P(x, y) satisfy vec{OP} cdot vec{OA} = 4, then the equation of the trajectory of the moving point P is __________.","completion":"From vec{OP} cdot vec{OA} = 4, we get x cdot 1 + y cdot 2 = 4.

To solve this, we first need to understand the definition of (phi^{!}(n)), which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to (n) that are relatively prime to (n). To find the remainder of the given sum modulo 50, we will break the calculation into parts: computing the sum modulo 2 and modulo 25, and then combining the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. # Step-by-Step Computation: 1. **Compute modulo 2**: Notice that for any odd ( n ), (phi^{!}(n)) is a product of numbers that include an even number (e.g., 2), making (phi^{!}(n)) even. Also, for even ( n ), (phi^{!}(n)) remains even since it includes ( n ) itself. Therefore, (phi^{!}(n)) is even for all ( n ) which means: [ phi^{!}(n) equiv 0 pmod{2} ] Consequently, the sum of even numbers modulo 2 will be zero: [ sum_{substack{2 leq n leq 50 operatorname{gcd}(n, 50)=1}} phi^{!}(n) equiv 0 pmod{2} ] 2. **Compute modulo 25**: - We consider the integers ( n ) from 2 to 50 that are coprime to 50: [ {3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, 29, 31, 33, 37, 39, 41, 43, 47} ] For each ( n ): - Calculate (gcd(n, 50)) and include only ( n )s coprime to 50. - Compute (phi^{!}(n)) values and sum the results modulo 25. - For ( n = 3, phi(3) = 3 - 1 = 2 Rightarrow phi^{!}(3) = 2! = 2 ) - For ( n = 7, phi(7) = 7 - 1 = 6 Rightarrow phi^{!}(7) = 720 ). Since ( 720 mod 25 = 20 ) - For ( n = 9, phi(9) = 6 Rightarrow phi^{!}(9) = 720 ). And ( 720 mod 25 = 20 ) - Continue this calculation: [ sum_{n in {3, 7, 9, 11, 13, ... }} phi^{!}(n) ] We notice that for higher values of ( n ) characterised by large factorials, (phi^{!}(n) ) modulo 25 tend to vanish (become multiples of 25). Collect relevant values: [ 2 + 20 + 20 + ldots equiv 12 (text{mod } 25) ] 3. **Combine using the Chinese Remainder Theorem**: We have: [ sum_{substack{2 leq n leq 50 operatorname{gcd}(n, 50)=1}} phi^{!}(n) equiv 0 pmod{2} ] [ sum_{substack{2 leq n leq 50 operatorname{gcd}(n, 50)=1}} phi^{!}(n) equiv 12 pmod{25} ] From these congruences, the solution must satisfy: [ x equiv 0 pmod{2} ] [ x equiv 12 pmod{25} ] From ( x equiv 12 pmod{25} ) we know ( x = 25k + 12 ).

Consider the initial pile of 660 rocks. Let's assume the rocks are divided into the maximum possible number of piles. Let the smallest pile contain (m) rocks. By the problem's condition, all piles contain fewer than (2m) rocks. 2. We can look at this process in reverse: Let's combine pairs of piles to form new piles. Notice that if the current minimum number of rocks in a pile is (m), then the resulting new pile will have at most (2m) rocks. Also, once we have obtained a pile with (2m) rocks, there cannot be any remaining piles with exactly (m) rocks. 3. This means that after each combination operation, the minimum number of rocks in any pile increases. Specifically, after (k) operations, the minimum number increases by at least (k). 4. Therefore, in the original set, there were at most (2k) numbers within the interval ([m, m+k)). This implies that if we order the original set of numbers in ascending order: - The first number will be at most (m), - The third number will be at most (m+1), - The fifth number will be at most (m+2), - and so on. 5.

We will use induction on k to prove this statement. 1. **Base Case:** For k = 1, we need to show that given 2^1 + 1 = 3 integers, we can choose 1 + 2 = 3 of them such that no two sums of m elements are equal for any m le 3. This is clear because given three numbers a < b < c, the sums a + b, a + c, and b + c are all distinct. Hence, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the claim holds for 2^k + 1 numbers, i.e., given 2^k + 1 integers, we can choose k + 2 of them satisfying the property P that for any m le k + 2, no two sums of m elements are equal. Now, consider an arbitrary set N of 2^{k+1} + 1 integers.

This step reduces the diameter of N by half, so we may perform it only finitely many times, resulting in a set N' with both even and odd numbers. It suffices to prove the claim for N', by the first observation. 5. **Application of the Box Principle:** Since |N'| = 2^{k+1} + 1, by the pigeonhole principle, there are 2^k + 1 elements of N' with the same parity. Taking N' or N' + 1, we may suppose there are 2^k + 1 even numbers. By the induction hypothesis, we may select a set of k + 1 of them satisfying P, and because of the second observation, if we add another odd integer to this set, we arrive at k + 2 integers satisfying P. 6. **Conclusion:** By the inductive step, we have shown that if the claim holds for 2^k + 1 numbers, it also holds for 2^{k+1} + 1 numbers.

This can be approached by squaring both sides to remove the absolute values: [ left(log_{a}(1-x)right)^2 > left(log_{a}(1+x)right)^2 ] 4. **Splitting the cases for different bases of logarithms:** We will analyze the cases for (a > 1) and (0 < a < 1) separately due to different behaviors of logarithmic functions across these intervals. 5. **Case 1: (a > 1)** - The function (log_{a}(y)) for (y) in ((0, 1)) is negative because as (a > 1), (log_{a}(1 text{ and less})) gives us a negative value. This implies (log_{a}(1-x)) is negative. - On the other hand, (log_{a}(y)) for (1 < y < a) yields a positive result. Hence, (log_{a}(1+x)) is positive. For (0 < x < 1): - (log_{a}(1-x) < 0) - (log_{a}(1+x) > 0) (|log_{a}(1-x)| = -log_{a}(1-x)) and (|log_{a}(1+x)| = log_{a}(1+x)). Therefore, comparing these: [ -log_{a}(1-x) overset{?}{>} log_{a}(1+x) ] Considering the monotonic decreasing behavior of logarithms in this base, [ 1-x < 1+x implies log_{a}(1-x) < log_{a}(1+x). ] Since (log_{a}(1-x)) is a larger magnitude negative number than the smaller positive (log_{a}(1+x)): [ - log_{a}(1-x) > log_{a}(1+x). ] This validates the inequality. 6. **Case 2: (0 < a < 1)** - For bases (0 < a < 1), the roles flip and logarithms are negative for (y > 1). This makes (log_{a}(1+x)) negatively large. - Conversely, (log_{a}(y)) is positive for (0 < y < 1). When (0 < x < 1): - (log_{a}(1-x) > 0) since (log_{a}(1-) > log_{a}(1)) positive. - (|log_{a}(1+x)| = -log_{a}(1+x)). [ |log_{a}(1-x)| = log_{a}(1-x) quad text{and} quad |log_{a}(1+x)| = -log_{a}(1+x). ] Again, through the logarithmic property comparison: [ log_{a}(1-x) > - log_{a}(1+x), ] which holds as the domain and inclining trend suggest for (0 < a < 1). Thus the inequality remains correct here as well. **Conclusion:** In both sub-cases, for bases (a) greater than 1 and between (0 text{ to } 1), the inequality (left| log_{a}(1-x) right| > left| log_{a}(1+x) right|) holds valid for (0 < x < 1).

This balance comes from Alice trying to maximize, but restricted by Bob’s move to minimize to a predictable extent. [ boxed{16} ]"},{"prompt":"Baker made 173 cakes.

Given that the temperature of the glass surface is below freezing, these droplets will quickly freeze, forming ice on the inner side of the windows. 5. **External Conditions and Absence of Condensation:** - Outside the trolleybus, the air is cold and typically dry, which means there is less moisture available to condense. - Furthermore, any condensation that might occur would more likely dissipate quickly due to the movement of air and the dry conditions outside, preventing ice from forming on the outer surface. # Conclusion: The reason ice forms on the inner surfaces of trolleybus windows during winter is due to the combination of warm, humid air inside and the cold external environment.

Combining these cases, we find that the solution to x cdot f(x) < 0 is in the intervals (-3,0) and (0,3). Therefore, the correct answer is option D: (-3,0) cup (0,3).

For N={x|log_{frac{1}{2}}(x-2)geqslant 1}, we have log_{frac{1}{2}}(x-2)=frac{log(x-2)}{log(frac{1}{2})}geqslant 1.

Let's denote the radii of the circles as r_1 and r_2, and the distance between their centers as d. For our circles, we have r_1 = 1 and r_2 = 4. To find the distance d between the centers, we apply the distance formula between the center of the first circle, (-2, a), and the center of the second circle, (a, 5): d = sqrt{ (a + 2)^2 + (5 - a)^2 }. Now, we express the intersection condition using the inequality: r_2 - r_1 < d < r_2 + r_1, which translates to: 4 - 1 < sqrt{ (a + 2)^2 + (5 - a)^2 } < 4 + 1.

We also know that the average of marks in the first 5 subjects is 74, so the total marks in those 5 subjects is 74 * 5. Ashok secured 86 marks in the last subject. Therefore, the total marks in the first (n-1) subjects plus the 86 marks in the last subject should equal the total marks in all subjects, which is 76n.

We need to show that: [ sum_{l=0}^d g(l) = leftlceil frac{(d+1)(d+2)}{6} rightrceil ] This implies that a generic exquisite polynomial can be expressed as a linear combination of these homogeneous parts. 3. **Crucial Claim:** If we let ( U = x^2 + xy + y^2 ), ( V = xy(x + y) ), and ( W = x^3 - 3xy^2 - y^3 ), then ( P ) is exquisite if and only if it can be written as ( Q(U, V, W) ), where the degree of ( U ) is ( leq 2 ). 4. **Implication:** - ( U, V, W ) are all exquisite, so ( Q(U, V, W) ) is exquisite as well. - For the other direction, we construct ( Q ) from ( P ) by induction on ( n ). 5. **Observation:** If ( y mid P ), then ( V mid P ). This follows from ( P(x, y) = P(y, -x - y) = P(-x - y, x) ). 6. **Induction Base Cases:** The base cases ( n leq 3 ) can be verified by hand. 7. **Induction Step:** Assume ( n geq 4 ).

If ( P ) is exquisite and the coefficient of ( x^n ) is ( a ), then: [ P - aU^jW^k ] is exquisite and divisible by ( y ), so it is a multiple of ( V ). Thus, we have: [ P = aU^jV^k + VP' ] where ( P' ) is exquisite and has degree ( n - 3 ). By the inductive hypothesis, there is a ( Q(U, V, W) = P'(x, y) ), which implies that ( P ) can be written in that form as well. This procedure ensures that the degree of ( U ) in the resulting polynomial is ( leq 2 ). 8. **Counting:** Observe that ( V^k, V^{k-1}W, ldots, W^k ) are all linearly independent. Therefore, ( U^jV^k, U^jV^{k-1}W, ldots, U^jW^k ) are also linearly independent. Since the crucial claim tells us that their linear combinations span the space of degree ( n ) exquisite polynomials, we get: [ g(3k + 2j) = k + 1 ] and ( g(1) = 0 ).

Given the quadratic equation is in the form ax^{2}+bx+c=0, where a=1, b=-(k+4), and c=4k, we calculate the discriminant Delta as follows: [ Delta = b^{2}-4ac ] Substituting the given values into the formula, we get: [ Delta = [-(k+4)]^{2}-4times 1 times 4k ] Simplifying the expression: [ begin{align*} Delta &= (k+4)^{2}-16k &= k^{2}+8k+16-16k &= k^{2}-8k+16 &= (k-4)^{2} end{align*} ] Since (k-4)^{2} is a square of a real number, it is always greater than or equal to zero: [ (k-4)^{2} geqslant 0 ] This implies that Delta geqslant 0 for any real value of k.

We need to find the geometric locus of the midpoints of such segments with endpoints lying on the sides of the square. Here, we consider two principal cases based on the value of (c). Case 1: (0 < c < 1) In this case, there are two subcases to consider: # Subcase 1a: Both endpoints of the segment lie on the same side of the square - If the endpoints of the segment lie on the same side of the square, then the midpoint of the segment must also lie on that same side. - For the segment to have length (c), the midpoint will be at a distance (c/2) from the endpoints along the side. - Hence, the possible midpoints form a line segment of length (1 - c) within each side of the square, starting (c/2) away from each corner. # Subcase 1b: The endpoints of the segment lie on adjacent sides of the square - In this scenario, one endpoint is on one side, and the other endpoint is on the adjacent side. - The midpoint will be inside the square and at a distance of (c/2) from the common vertex where the two sides meet. - Therefore, the possible midpoints form arcs of a circle of radius (c/2) centered at each vertex of the square. - The endpoints of these arcs are determined by points on the sides where one endpoint of the segment just reaches the midpoints of the square sides. Concluding Subcase 1: - We get a geometric combination of four line segments and four quarter-circle arcs of radius (c/2) centered at the vertex of the square. Case 2: (1 leq c leq sqrt{2}) In this case, two subcases occur: # Subcase 2a: The endpoints of the segment lie on adjacent sides of the square - As in Subcase 1b, the possible midpoints will form arcs but only parts of the arcs that fit within the square. # Subcase 2b: The endpoints of the segment lie on opposite sides of the square - Now, the midpoint must be on the middle line segment that divides the square into two. - In this case, midpoints will form a line segment parallel to the sides of the square. This segment will be the part of the middle line such that the corresponding segment of length (c) lies within the square. - The length of this line segment will be from the point (c/2) away from the middle of the sides. Concluding Subcase 2: - Here, the locus will be composed of arcs from Subcase 2a combined with segments from Subcase 2b connecting these arcs if necessary. # Final Conclusion: By combining all relevant subcases, the midpoint locus will be a composite geometric structure: - For (1 < c < sqrt{2}), it is a curvilinear quadrilateral with four central arcs. - For (c = 1), the locus would extend to the edges corresponding to the midlines of the square. - For (c = sqrt{2}), it would collapse to the center point of the square, as only here can such a long segment's midpoint lie completely within the square.

How many distinct convex polygons of three or more sides can be drawn using some (or all) of the twelve points as vertices, given that no internal angle of the polygon at the circle's center is less than 30 degrees?","completion":"First, we calculate the total number of subsets of three or more points from a twelve-member set. There are 2^{12} = 4096 total subsets of a twelve-member set. Using combinations, we find: - {12 choose 0} = 1 subset with 0 members. - {12 choose 1} = 12 subsets with 1 member. - {12 choose 2} = 66 subsets with 2 members. Thus, the number of subsets with three or more points is 4096 - 1 - 12 - 66 = 4017. Next, we need to exclude the subsets that form polygons with angles at the center less than 30 degrees. Considering 12 points, each adjacent pair of points subtends an angle of 30^circ (360/12). Thus, for any polygon, if the number of vertices is such that it skips 1 point in between (i.e., selects every alternate point around the circle), then the smallest angle it can have at the center is 30^circ. To meet the requirement, the subset must skip at least one point between chosen vertices. We calculate the number of valid subsets by considering subsets of points that are chosen such that no two consecutive points are selected: - For polygons with 3 sides, we choose every fourth point, making frac{12}{4} = 3 rotational symmetries and hence 3 valid polygons. - For polygons with 4 sides and beyond, skipping one or more points between chosen ones always meets the angle condition. Estimating the count of larger valid polygons requires considering how many ways we can pick points such that they skip at least one (the scenario of one skip is the most restrictive, hence critical in this case). This problem escalates in complexity; however, the overall number of valid polygons will be fewer than 4017.

Therefore, the maximum number of books any single student could have borrowed is boxed{14} books."},{"prompt":"The mean of three numbers is 20 more than the least of the numbers and 10 less than the greatest.

Given the median of the three numbers is (10), we have (b = 10). 2. The information about the mean translates to the equations: [ frac{a+b+c}{3} = a + 20 quad text{and} quad frac{a+b+c}{3} = c - 10 ] 3. Substitute (b = 10) into the equations: [ frac{a+10+c}{3} = a + 20 quad text{and} quad frac{a+10+c}{3} = c - 10 ] 4. Equate the two expressions for the mean: [ a + 20 = c - 10 ] 5. Solve for (c) in terms of (a): [ c = a + 30 ] 6. Substitute (c = a + 30) back into the equation for the mean: [ frac{a+10+(a+30)}{3} = a + 20 ] Simplify and solve for (a): [ frac{2a+40}{3} = a + 20 ] [ 2a + 40 = 3a + 60 ] [ 40 = a + 60 ] [ a = -20 ] 7. Now, substitute (a = -20) into the expression for (c): [ c = -20 + 30 = 10 ] 8. The three numbers are (a = -20), (b = 10), and (c = 10).

The formula for derangements (!n) of 5 objects involves permutations and a sum of terms: [ P(X=0) = frac{{C}_{4}^{1}(2+3times3)}{{A}_{5}^{5}} = frac{44}{120} = frac{11}{30} ] - **Calculating P(X=1):** If exactly one expert sits in the correct seat, we choose 1 out of 5 to be correct and then derange the remaining 4: [ P(X=1) = frac{{C}_{5}^{1} times 9}{{A}_{5}^{5}} = frac{45}{120} = frac{3}{8} ] - **Calculating P(X=2):** For exactly two experts in the correct seats, choose 2 out of 5 and derange the remaining 3: [ P(X=2) = frac{{C}_{5}^{2} times 2}{{A}_{5}^{5}} = frac{20}{120} = frac{1}{6} ] - **Calculating P(X=3):** With three experts correctly seated, choose 3 out of 5 and derange the remaining 2 (which is not possible, hence direct calculation): [ P(X=3) = frac{{C}_{5}^{3} times 1}{{A}_{5}^{5}} = frac{10}{120} = frac{1}{12} ] - **Calculating P(X=5):** The probability that all five experts are in the correct seats is simply: [ P(X=5) = frac{1}{{A}_{5}^{5}} = frac{1}{120} ] - **Distribution Table of X:** | X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | |-----|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------| | P | frac{11}{30} | frac{3}{8} | frac{1}{6} | frac{1}{12} | frac{1}{120} | - **Calculating Expected Value E(X):** The expected value is calculated as: [ E(X) = 0 times frac{11}{30} + 1 times frac{3}{8} + 2 times frac{1}{6} + 3 times frac{1}{12} + 5 times frac{1}{120} = 1 ] Therefore, the expected value of X is boxed{1}. **(2) Probability Given Three Experts are Sitting in the Wrong Seats** - **Calculating P(A):** The probability that three experts are sitting in the wrong seats is: [ P(A) = 1 - P(X=3) - P(X=5) = 1 - frac{1}{12} - frac{1}{120} = frac{109}{120} ] - **Calculating P(AB):** The probability that exactly two experts are sitting in the correct seats is: [ P(AB) = P(X=2) = frac{1}{6} ] - **Calculating P(B|A):** The conditional probability that exactly two experts are sitting in the correct seats given that three are in the wrong seats is: [ P(B|A) = frac{P(AB)}{P(A)} = frac{frac{1}{6}}{frac{109}{120}} = frac{20}{109} ] Therefore, the required probability is boxed{frac{20}{109}}."}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},W={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},z=["disabled"],N={key:0},M={key:1};function I(n,e,h,m,o,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",W,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
