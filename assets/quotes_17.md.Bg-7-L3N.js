Let ( x_0 in {x mid f(x)=0, x in mathbb{R}} ). This means that ( f(x_0) = 0 ). 2.

A light is termed faulty if and only if it has an even number of neighboring lights that are on. Find the minimum possible number of faulty lights in this 2017 times 2017 grid. Note: Two lights are considered neighbors if their cells share a common edge.","completion":"To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of \\"bad\\" lights in a (2017 times 2017) grid where each light can be either \\"on\\" or \\"off,\\" we proceed as follows: 1. **Grid Coloring** Consider the (2017 times 2017) grid and think of it as if it was a chessboard, coloring it in a black and white pattern. Define the first cell ((1, 1)) as black, subsequently coloring the grid such that no two adjacent cells share the same color. 2. **Defining Lights Based on Color** Define lights on black cells as black lights and lights on white cells as white lights. Each light can only be in one of two states: on (assigned a value of 1) or off (assigned a value of 0). 3. **Condition for a \\"Bad\\" Light** A light is termed \\"bad\\" if it is adjacent to an odd number of lights that are \\"on\\". We need to ensure that no light in the grid can be bad. 4. **Coordinate System and Parity Condition** Use the coordinates ((i, j)) for lights on the grid with (i, j in {1, 2, ..., 2017}). Notice that a light at ((i, j)) is black if (i + j) is even, and white if (i + j) is odd. 5. **Sum Definitions** Let (a_{i,j}) represent the sum of the values of the lights adjacent to the light at ((i, j)). The total sum (S) of all (a_{i,j}) where both (i) and (j) are even must be considered. Each (a_{i,j}) must be odd since each cell is adjacent to an odd number of cells of the opposite color on this parity-based grid. 6. **Contradiction Argument** Since the grid’s size ensures each black light would consequently impact the sum (S) by the values of black lights adjacent to it and multiplied by 2 (since they are counted multiple times via the adjacency), then (S) must be an even number contrary to the previous statement of being odd, leading to a contradiction. This implies that there must be at least one bad light. 7. **Minimal \\"Bad\\" Light Configuration** Consider a configuration to establish exactly one bad light minimally: - For black lights at ((i, j)): [ text{Assign value 0 if } max{|i|, |j|} equiv 0, 1 pmod{4} ] [ text{Assign value 1 if } max{|i|, |j|} equiv 2, 3 pmod{4} ] - For white lights at ((i, j)): [ text{Assign value 0 if } max{|i|, |j| - 1} equiv 0, 1 pmod{4} ] [ text{Assign value 1 if } max{|i|, |j| - 1} equiv 2, 3 pmod{4} ] 8. **Detailed Analysis for Borders and minimal conditions**: - For the borders and edges of the grid, check if all edge lights have any neighboring effect having seamless transition according to the defined assignments. - For edge lights' placement and conditions when they minimally are impacted by more than three adjacent lights confirming the minimal consistent parity. 9. **Conclusion**: By ensuring these detailed placement and state definitions, the configuration allows only one \\"bad\\" light: the light at the center at coordinates ((0, 0)).

Let's denote the colors by (B) (blue) and (G) (green). - The first row might look something like: [ B, G, B, G, ldots quad text{or} quad G, B, G, B, ldots ] - Thus, there are two ways to color the first row without adjacent cells having the same color. 3. **Determining the Subsequent Rows**: - Once the first row is fixed, the coloring of the rest of the board follows certain rules: - If starting the second row with the same color as the first row, this pattern will propagate throughout the board. - If starting with the opposite color from the first row, this pattern will propagate similarly. - Therefore, each subsequent row can be colored in exactly two ways based on the first cell of the row (either matching the first row above or being the opposite). 4. **Count of Patterns**: - Since there are (10) rows, and each different row pattern follows the rule derived from the first row, - Fixing the first row’s pattern determines (2^{9}) ways because each row after the first row has two options: [ 2^{10} text{ways to color any row} - 2 text{ patterns that result in same color adjacent cells}. ] 5. **Combining All Patterns**: - Total number of coloring patterns with the first row fixed is: [ = 2^{10} text{ valid colorings of first row without adjacent same colored cells}. ] - Valid overall patterns leading to: [ = 2^{10} + (2^{10} - 2) = 2^{11} - 2 = 2046 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{2046} ]"},{"prompt":"Rebecca drinks half a bottle of soda a day.

What is the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get on the final assignment to beat both Emily and Sarah, assuming all grades are whole numbers?","completion":"To determine the minimum grade Ahmed needs to get on the final assignment to beat both Emily and Sarah, we first need to calculate the total points each of them has before the final assignment, and then see what Ahmed would need to surpass them. Ahmed's current total is 91 * 9 = 819 points. Emily's current total is 92 * 9 = 828 points. Sarah's current total is 94 * 9 = 846 points. Emily got a 90 on the final assignment, so her final total is 828 + 90 = 918 points. Ahmed needs to beat Sarah's final score to be the top of the class. Since the final assignment is worth the same amount as the other assignments, we can calculate the minimum score Ahmed needs on the final assignment to beat Sarah's final score. Let's denote Ahmed's final assignment score as A. His total score after the final assignment would be 819 + A. To beat Sarah, Ahmed needs to have a total score greater than Sarah's final score. Sarah's final score will be her current total plus the minimum passing score (since we don't know her final assignment score), which is 70. Sarah's final score = 846 + 70 = 916 points. So, Ahmed needs to have a total score greater than 916 points. 819 + A > 916 A > 916 - 819 A > 97 Since all grades are whole numbers, Ahmed needs to get at least a boxed{98} on the final assignment to beat both Emily and Sarah."},{"prompt":"Prove that the system of equations has no solutions. left{ begin{array}{c} x^{3}+x+y+1=0 y x^{2}+x+y=0 y^{2}+yx^{2}+1=0 end{array} right.","completion":"Given the system of equations: [ left{ begin{array}{l} x^{3} + x + y + 1 = 0 y x^{2} + x + y = 0 y^{2} + y - x^{2} + 1 = 0 end{array} right. ] We need to prove that this system has no solutions. 1. **Analyze the first two equations:** Consider the first equation: [ x^{3} + x + y + 1 = 0 implies y = -x^{3} - x - 1 ] Substitute ( y = -x^{3} - x - 1 ) into the second equation: [ y x^{2} + x + y = 0 rightarrow (-x^{3} - x - 1) x^{2} + x + (-x^{3} - x - 1) = 0 ] 2. **Simplify the substituted second equation:** [ begin{align*} (-x^{3} - x - 1) x^{2} + x + (-x^{3} - x - 1) &= 0 -x^{5} - x^{3} - x^{2} + x - x^{3} - x - 1 &= 0 -x^{5} - 2x^{3} - x^{2} - 1 &= 0 end{align*} ] This equation must hold true for all ( x ). 3. **Analyze the third equation:** Substitute ( y = -x^{3} - x - 1 ) into the third equation: [ y^{2} + y - x^{2} + 1 = 0 rightarrow (-x^{3} - x - 1)^{2} + (-x^{3} - x - 1) - x^{2} + 1 = 0 ] 4. **Expand and simplify the expression:** [ begin{align*} (-x^{3} - x - 1)^{2} &= x^{6} + 2x^{4} + 2x^{3} + x^{2} + 2x + 1 &implies x^{6} + 2x^{4} + x^{2} - x^{2} + 2x + 1 + (-x^{3} - x - 1) + 1 = 0 &implies x^{6} + 2x^{4} + x^{3} + 1 + 1 - x^{2} + 2x + 1 - 1 - x^{3} - x - 1 = 0 &implies x^{6} + 2x^{4} - x^{3} + 2x + 1 + 1 = 0 &implies x^{6} + 2x^{4} + x^{3} + x^{2} + 2x + 1 = 0 end{align*} ] Since both expressions diverge in their terms, and there's a contradiction, we conclude that: [ y^{2} + y - x^{2} + 1 = 0 ] Contradicts: [ y^{2} + y - x^{2} + 1 neq x^{6} + 2x^{4} + ... ] Hence, the given system of equations has no solution.

Is it always possible to cut the grass as desired?","completion":"# Problem: In our garden, the lawn consists of n blades of grass. We want to mow the lawn so that each blade is of equal length, but the total length of the grass blades does not change. We are allowed to make a total of n-1 cuts on the grass blades, and the cut-off pieces can be attached to each other or to the remaining pieces. Is it always possible to mow the lawn according to the requirements? I. First Solution: 1. **Initial Setup**: Select the blades of grass that are longer than the average length and cut them to the average length. 2. **Handling Cut-Off Pieces**: Collect the cut-off excess lengths and glue them together to form a single blade. 3. **Redistributing Excess**: Cut this single blade into pieces that are exactly the lengths needed to make shorter-than-average blades reach the average length. - This is possible because the total excess from the longer blades equals the total shortage of the shorter blades, due to the properties of the average. 4. **Gluing Shorter Blades**: Finally, attach these cut pieces to the appropriate shorter blades. By following these steps, every blade will be of average length. Initially, we make as many cuts as the number of excessively long blades, and then one less cut than the number of shorter blades, totaling at most n-1 cuts. Thus, mowing the lawn to meet the requirements is always possible with a maximum of n-1 cuts. II. Second Solution: 1. **Base Case**: For n=1, the statement is clearly true since there is only one blade of grass, and no cuts are necessary. 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for n-1 blades of grass. Now consider the case with n blades. 3. **Selecting a Blade**: Choose one of the longest blades. - If this blade is exactly 1 unit long, then all blades are 1 unit long, and no cuts are needed. - Otherwise, cut this blade to the average length (which, without loss of generality, can be considered 1 if the total length is n). 4. **Reassessing Remaining Blades**: Glue the cut-off piece (considered as a single segment) to any of the remaining blades. Now we have n-1 blades left with a total length of n-1. 5. **Applying Induction**: By the inductive hypothesis, we can mow these n-1 blades to all be of unit length with at most n-2 additional cuts. This confirms that it is always possible to mow the lawn as required.

We aim to find the real numbers ( alpha ) and ( beta ) such that: [ lim_{n to +infty} frac{S_n}{n^alpha} = beta. ] 3. To proceed, first identify the position where the number ( n ) appears for the first time: [ 1 + 2 + cdots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}. ] 4. Given that ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ) is the last position of the number ( n ), we calculate ( S_{frac{n(n+1)}{2}} ) and use it as a reference for our analysis. 5. Define: [ B_n = frac{sum_{k=1}^{frac{n(n+1)}{2}} a_k}{left[frac{n(n+1)}{2}right]^alpha}. ] 6. We calculate ( sum_{k=1}^{frac{n(n+1)}{2}} a_k ), which is: [ sum_{k=1}^n (1 + 2 + cdots + k) = sum_{k=1}^n frac{k(k+1)}{2}. ] 7. Hence: [ B_n = frac{sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{k(k+1)}{2}}{left[frac{n(n+1)}{2}right]^alpha}. ] 8. Note: [ sum_{k=1}^n frac{k(k+1)}{2} = frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^n (k^2 + k) = frac{1}{2} left(sum_{k=1}^n k^2 + sum_{k=1}^n kright). ] 9. Using standard summation formulas: [ sum_{k=1}^n k = frac{n(n+1)}{2}, quad sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}. ] 10. Therefore: [ sum_{k=1}^n frac{k(k+1)}{2} = frac{1}{2} left( frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} + frac{n(n+1)}{2} right). ] 11. Simplifying, [ sum_{k=1}^n frac{k(k+1)}{2} = frac{1}{2} left( frac{n(n+1)(2n+3)}{6} right) = frac{n(n+1)(2n+3)}{12}. ] 12. Thus, [ B_n = frac{frac{n(n+1)(2n+3)}{12}}{left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right)^alpha} = frac{frac{n(n+1)(2n+3)}{12}}{left( frac{n(n+1)}{2} right)^alpha}. ] 13. Approximating for large ( n ): [ B_n approx frac{frac{n^3}{6}}{left( frac{n^2}{2} right)^alpha} = frac{n^3}{6 cdot 2^{-alpha} n^{2alpha}} = frac{n^3}{12n^{2alpha-1}}. ] 14. For (B_n) to converge to a nonzero constant ( beta ), the exponents of ( n ) in the numerator and denominator must match. Thus: [ 3 = 2alpha - 1 quad Rightarrow quad alpha = frac{3}{2}. ] 15. Then: [ B_n = frac{n^3}{12 n^2} = frac{1}{12}. ] 16. Considering the actual contribution factors: [ beta = frac{sqrt{2}}{3}. ] 17. Therefore, the values of ( alpha ) and ( beta ) fulfilling the condition are: [ (alpha, beta) = left( frac{3}{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{3} right). ] Hence, the solution is ( boxed{left( frac{3}{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{3} right)} )."},{"prompt":"Given c > 1, the solution set of the inequality x^{2}(c+ dfrac {1}{c})x+1 > 0 is ( ) A: {x| dfrac {1}{c} < x < c} B: {x|x > dfrac {1}{c}, text{or} x > c} C: {x|x < dfrac {1}{c}, text{or} x > c} D: {x|c < x < dfrac {1}{c}}","completion":"Since c > 1, it follows that dfrac {1}{c} < 1 < c; The inequality x^{2}-(c+ dfrac {1}{c})x+1 > 0 can be transformed into (x-c)(x- dfrac {1}{c}) > 0, which yields x < dfrac {1}{c} or x > c; Therefore, the solution set of the inequality is {x|x < dfrac {1}{c} or x > c}.

Now, let's consider the squares of these possible remainders when divided by 6: - If the remainder is 1, then the square is 1^2 = 1, and the remainder when divided by 6 is still 1. - If the remainder is 5, then the square is 5^2 = 25, and the remainder when divided by 6 is 1, because 24 is the nearest multiple of 6 to 25, and 25 - 24 = 1. So, both possible remainders (1 and 5) for a prime number when divided by 6 will result in a square that has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. The smallest prime number greater than 3 is 5, which has a remainder of 5 when divided by 6. Let's check if 5^2 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6: 5^2 = 25 25 ÷ 6 = 4 with a remainder of 1 Therefore, the smallest possible value of p, where p is a prime number and p^2 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6, is boxed{5} ."},{"prompt":"Given that one focus of the ellipse frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 (a > b > 0) is F(1,0), and the two trisection points M, N of the minor axis and F form an equilateral triangle, find the equation of the ellipse.","completion":"Since the two trisection points of the minor axis and one focus form an equilateral triangle, and the distance from the focus to the center is c=1, We know that the height of the equilateral triangle is frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}.

Let's consider (a = 2n), (b = 1), and (c = -1): [ (a+b)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} (2n)^{n-k} 1^k ] [ (a+c)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} c^k = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} (2n)^{n-k} (-1)^k ] 3. Substitute and simplify the right-hand side of our inequality: [ (2n+1)^n - (2n-1)^n = left[sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} (2n)^{n-k} 1^kright] - left[sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} (2n)^{n-k} (-1)^kright] ] Group the terms: [ = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} (2n)^{n-k} (1 - (-1)^k) ] 4. Note that when (k) is even, ((1 - (-1)^k) = 0), and when (k) is odd, ((1 - (-1)^k) = 2). Therefore, we can simplify: [ (2n+1)^n - (2n-1)^n = 2 sum_{text{k odd}} binom{n}{k} (2n)^{n-k} ] 5. To show that the right-hand-side (2 sum_{text{k odd}} binom{n}{k} (2n)^{n-k} > (2n)^n), observe that each term in the sum (sum_{text{k odd}} binom{n}{k} (2n)^{n-k}) is positive and contributes to the sum because (k) runs over half of the values from 0 to (n). Therefore, the whole sum is indeed larger than ((2n)^n). 6. One specific subset of these terms occurs when (n geq 3) since not all terms will cancel out, specifically terms with one less (2n) term which multiply out to at least: [ 2n c^ {n-1} , text{where} , c^{n-1} = (2n)^{n-1} > (2n)^n ] Conclusion: As each term on RHS exceeds (2n^n), the inequality holds: boxed{(2n-1)^n + (2n)^n < (2n+1)^n}"},{"prompt":"The sandwich shop has five types of bread, seven types of meat, and six types of cheese.

We are given the problem of finding two 100-digit natural numbers that satisfy specific properties related to their squares and cubes. Let’s denote these numbers as n_1 and n_2. 2. Consider the number n_1 = 10^{100} - 1. This number consists of 100 digits, all of which are 9. Now, we need to show that: - The cubic value n_1^3 ends in the same digits as n_1, - The square value n_1^2 does not end in the same digits as n_1. 3. First, let's analyze n_1^3: - Observe that n_1 = 10^{100} - 1. Then the expression for n_1^3 - n_1 becomes: [ n_1^3 - n_1 = (n_1 - 1) n_1 (n_1 + 1) = (10^{100} - 2) (10^{100} - 1) 10^{100} ] - In this expanded form, 10^{100} is a common factor. Therefore, n_1^3 equiv n_1 pmod{10^{100}}, meaning the last 100 digits of n_1^3 are the same as n_1. 4. Next, let's look at n_1^2: - The term n_1^2 - n_1 = n_1(n_1 - 1) = (10^{100} - 1)(10^{100} - 2). - This product will not have 100 trailing 9s (it does not match 10^{100} - 1 exactly) because: [ n_1^2 - n_1 equiv (10^{100} - 1)(10^{100} - 2) pmod{10^{100}} ] - Thus, the value n_1^2 does not end in the same digits as n_1. 5. Now, consider the second number n_2 = 5 cdot 10^{99} - 1. This number also has 100 digits, with the first 99 digits being zero and the last digit being 4. 6. Let's analyze n_2^3: - We observe that n_2 = 5 cdot 10^{99} - 1. Then the expression for n_2^3 - n_2 becomes: [ n_2^3 - n_2 = (n_2 - 1) n_2 (n_2 + 1) = (5 cdot 10^{99} - 2) (5 cdot 10^{99} - 1) 5 cdot 10^{99} ] - Similar to n_1, 10^{99} in the expression shows that n_2^3 equiv n_2 pmod{10^{100}}. So the last 100 digits of n_2^3 will also be same as n_2. 7. Finally, consider n_2^2: - The term n_2^2 - n_2 = n_2(n_2 - 1) = (5 cdot 10^{99} - 1)(5 cdot 10^{99} - 2). - This product also does not match 10^{100} - 1 in the last 100 digits because: [ n_2^2 - n_2 equiv (5 cdot 10^{99} - 1)(5 cdot 10^{99} - 2) pmod{10^{100}} ] - Therefore, the value n_2^2 does not end in the same digits as n_2. # Conclusion: We have demonstrated with two concrete examples: - n_1 = 10^{100} - 1 - n_2 = 5 cdot 10^{99} - 1 These numbers satisfy both given conditions.

Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 90 kmph + 12 kmph Relative speed = 102 kmph Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the length of the train, which is given in meters. 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, to convert kmph to m/s, we multiply by 1000 and divide by 3600.

This octagon would then be bounded by 8 edges. 2. **Analyze the endpoints of the slice's edges:** Each edge of the octagon must have two endpoints, and all these endpoints must lie inside the heptagon. Therefore, we will have a total of (8 times 2 = 16) endpoints (vertices) in the heptagon for the octagonal slice. 3. **Restriction on edges from each vertex:** From a geometric perspective, the cake slices are created by diagonal cuts from the vertices of the heptagon. Each vertex can be connected via a maximum of two edges since a slice can be defined only within a specific angular region defined by two cuts from the vertex. 4. **Maximum number of endpoints:** Given a heptagon, which has 7 vertices, each having at most 2 edges emanating from it, the maximal number of endpoints that can originate from the vertices of the heptagon is: [ 7 text{ vertices} times 2 text{ edges per vertex} = 14 text{ endpoints} ] 5. **Contradiction in the assumption:** - The assumption that we need 16 endpoints for our octagonal slice. - We derived that there can be at most 14 endpoints available from the heptagon’s vertices. - Since (16 > 14), it is not possible to accommodate 16 endpoints within the heptagon. 6. **Conclusion:** The wish of the celebrant to get an octagon-shaped slice from a heptagon cannot be realized based on the geometric constraints and the maximum number of endpoints.

The highest common factor (h.c.f.) of A and B is 25. This means that both A and B are multiples of 25.

The l.c.m. can be expressed as the product of the h.c.f. and the other two factors, which we'll call X and 16. So, we have: l.c.m. = h.c.f. * X * 16 Since A is one of the numbers and it is a multiple of the h.c.f., A can be expressed as: A = h.c.f. * m where m is an integer. Given that A is 400, we have: 400 = 25 * m Solving for m gives us: m = 400 / 25 m = 16 Now, since A (which is 400) is a multiple of the h.c.f.

We already have A (400) as a multiple of the h.c.f.

You can either remove nothing or remove everything; in the latter case, we consider the monomial to be 1 (Euler).","completion":"1. **Base Case:** Let's first consider the base case where ( n = 1 ). Here, the function ( K_1(x_1) ) represents the sum of all possible monomials formed by removing non-overlapping pairs of adjacent variables. However, with only one variable ( x_1 ), there are no pairs to remove. Thus, by definition: [ K_1(x_1) = x_1 ] This confirms that the statement holds true for ( n = 1 ) as it is trivially obvious. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that the statement holds for some ( n = k ). That is, the function ( K_k(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k) ) represents the sum of all monomials formed by removing some non-overlapping pairs ( x_i x_{i+1} ) from the product ( x_1 x_2 cdots x_k ). 3. **Proof for ( n = k+1 ):** Consider ( n = k+1 ). We need to show that ( K_{k+1}(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{k+1}) ) follows the same rule.

Thus, these monomials are derived from the function ( K_k(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k) ) with the additional variable ( x_{k+1} ), i.e., each monomial in ( K_k ) just gets multiplied by ( x_{k+1} ): [ x_{k+1} K_k(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k) ] **Category 2:** When ( x_{k+1} ) is removed, ( x_k ) must also be removed since they form an adjacent pair. Therefore, the monomials in this category are derived from ( K_{k-1}(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{k-1}) ), representing the sum of all monomials formed by removing non-overlapping pairs of adjacent variables from ( x_1 x_2 cdots x_{k-1} ). The function represents the scenario where the product ends at ( x_{k-1} ): [ K_{k-1}(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{k-1}) ] 4. **Combining the Results:** By combining the results from the above two categories, we can express ( K_{k+1}(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{k+1}) ) as: [ K_{k+1}(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{k+1}) = x_{k+1} K_k(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k) + K_{k-1}(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{k-1}) ] This confirms that ( K_{k+1} ) also represents the sum of all monomials obtained by removing some non-overlapping pairs of adjacent variables from the product ( x_1 x_2 cdots x_{k+1} ). 5. **Conclusion:** By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is proven to be true for all ( n geq 1 ). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let f(x) = (x1)^3 + x + 2, where {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of frac{1}{2}, and f(a_1) + f(a_2) + f(a_3) + f(a_4) + f(a_5) + f(a_6) = 18.

Since ellipse C_{2} has the major axis of C_{1} as its minor axis and has the same eccentricity as C_{1}, the foci of ellipse C_{2} are on the y-axis, 2b = 4, and e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.

We need to evaluate the monotonicity of both the inner function t and the outer logarithmic function y: 1. The inner function t = -x^2 + 2x can be rewritten as t = -(x^2 - 2x). Completing the square gives t = -(x-1)^2 + 1. From this form, it is evident that t achieves a maximum when x = 1 and decreases on either side of this point.

In other words, as t increases, y decreases. By combining these two observations, we note that due to the \\"opposite\\" monotonic characteristics of the inner and outer functions (the inner decreases while the outer also decreases), the composite function f(x) will be increasing.

We notice the following pattern: - The first term a_1 = a = 3. - The second term a_2 = 2 cdot a = 2 cdot 3. - The third term a_3 = 2 cdot (a + 2a) = 2 cdot 3a = 2 cdot 3 cdot 3. - The fourth term a_4 = 2 cdot (a + 2a + 6a) = 2 cdot 9a = 2 cdot 3^2 cdot a. - The fifth term a_5 = 2 cdot (a + 2a + 6a + 18a) = 2 cdot 27a = 2 cdot 3^3 cdot a. 4. Observing this pattern, we can generalize the (n)-th term: [ a_n = 2 cdot 3^{n-2} cdot a ] Given (a = 3). Therefore: [ a_n = 2 cdot 3^{n-2} cdot 3 = 2 cdot 3^{n-1} ] 5. To find the index after which each term exceeds 2007: - We start by examining when (a_n > 2007). 6. Solving the inequality: [ 2 cdot 3^{n-1} > 2007 ] Dividing both sides by 2: [ 3^{n-1} > frac{2007}{2} approx 1003.5 ] Taking the logarithm base 3 of both sides: [ n-1 > log_3 1003.5 ] Using a calculator or logarithm tables: [ log_3 1003.5 approx 6.29 ] Therefore: [ n-1 > 6.29 implies n > 7.29 ] Hence: [ n = 8 ] 7. Conclusion: The sequence’s terms start being greater than 2007 beginning from the 8th term.

Which of the following statements is incorrect? A: The population is the weight of the 4000 students in the school. B: The individual is each student. C: The sample is the weight of the 400 selected students. D: The sample size is 400.","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement given in the options based on the definitions of population, individual, sample, and sample size in the context of statistical studies. - **Population**: This refers to the entire group that is being studied. In this case, the population is indeed all 4000 students in the school, as we are interested in the weights of all these students. Therefore, statement A, which says \\"The population is the weight of the 4000 students in the school,\\" correctly identifies the population. Thus, A is not the incorrect statement we are looking for. - **Individual**: In the context of this study, an individual refers to a single entity from which data can be collected. Here, each student from whom weight data can be collected is considered an individual. Statement B says \\"The individual is each student,\\" which is a correct definition. However, the solution indicates a misunderstanding, suggesting that B is incorrect because it supposedly says the individual is the weight of each student. This interpretation is incorrect; the statement B correctly identifies individuals as the students themselves, not their weights. Therefore, there's a discrepancy in the solution's interpretation. - **Sample**: A sample is a subset of the population from which data is actually collected. In this scenario, the 400 students selected for the weight survey constitute the sample. Statement C, \\"The sample is the weight of the 400 selected students,\\" correctly identifies what the sample consists of (though it could be more accurately stated as \\"the sample consists of the 400 selected students\\"). Thus, C correctly identifies the sample and is not the incorrect statement. - **Sample Size**: This refers to the number of individuals or observations in the sample. With 400 students selected for the survey, the sample size is indeed 400, as stated in D. This makes D a correct statement and not the one we're looking for. Given the analysis above, the solution's conclusion that B is the incorrect statement due to a supposed error in identifying what an individual is, is based on a misinterpretation. Each statement should be evaluated based on the definitions of population, individual, sample, and sample size: - A correctly identifies the population. - B correctly identifies the individual, contrary to the solution's claim. - C correctly identifies the sample. - D correctly identifies the sample size. Therefore, based on the correct interpretation of the terms, all statements A, C, and D are correctly aligned with their definitions. The confusion arises from the solution's interpretation of B. However, since the task is to rewrite the solution as provided, and following the instructions to not invent new ideas but to stay as close as possible to the given solution, we proceed with the conclusion that: The incorrect statement, according to the provided solution, is B, because it supposedly misidentifies the individual.

How many toy cars did Dad give Olaf?","completion":"Let's denote the number of toy cars given by the uncle as U. According to the information given: - Grandpa gave Olaf twice as many toy cars as the uncle, so Grandpa gave 2U toy cars. - Auntie gave Olaf 6 toy cars, which is 1 more than the uncle, so the uncle gave 6 - 1 = 5 toy cars (U = 5). - Grandpa, therefore, gave 2 * 5 = 10 toy cars. Now we know the number of toy cars given by the uncle, grandpa, and auntie, we can calculate the total number of toy cars Olaf received from them: 5 (from uncle) + 10 (from grandpa) + 6 (from auntie) = 21 toy cars. Olaf had 150 toy cars initially and received a total of 196 toy cars after the gifts. The number of toy cars given by the family is the difference between the final total and the initial amount: 196 (final total) - 150 (initial amount) = 46 toy cars. We already know that Olaf received 21 toy cars from his uncle, grandpa, and auntie. So, the number of toy cars given by Mum and Dad together is: 46 (total from family) - 21 (from uncle, grandpa, and auntie) = 25 toy cars.

Hence, there are two configurations possible: - Alternating pattern: ( text{AMAMAM} ) - Pair pattern: ( text{AAMMAAMM} ) 2. **Analyzing the Alternating Pattern:** - **Configuration:** ( text{AMAMAM...} ) - **Problem:** In this configuration, every magician has two neighboring alchemists. Thus, it is impossible for a magician to direct his wands towards two neighboring magicians because both of his neighbors are alchemists. This violates **Condition 2**. 3. **Analyzing the Pair Pattern:** - **Configuration:** ( text{AAMMAAMM...} ) - **Problem:** In this configuration, a magician's neighbors can be another magician and an alchemist or alchemists on both sides, and same for alchemists. For example, each pair of magicians is followed or preceded by a pair of alchemists. This results in: - For a magician, both neighbors are either other magicians or alchemists. - If directed wands are aimed at the third positions: - Since there are 100 people in total, they form a cycle. - There are 50 pairs of ( text{Mages and Alchemists} ). It is impossible for the third person (directly opposite) to be consistently a magician or an alchemist that would satisfy **Condition 2** due to pair configuration cycle within a 100 arrangements (100 mod 4 != 0). 4. **Conclusion from the above analyses:** - Both the alternating and pair patterns fail to satisfy the requirement that each magician should aim their wands at at least two magicians. - Therefore, it becomes clear that regardless of how magicians and alchemists are seated, the second condition cannot be met, and as a result, they will not be able to turn iron into gold.

We need to color every cell on an infinite plane either black or white such that: 1. Every vertical and horizontal line intersects a finite number of white cells. 2. Every diagonal line intersects a finite number of black cells. 1. **Setting up the System:** - Introduce the inequalities ( |y| geq x^2 ) and ( |x| geq y^2 ). 2. **Coloring the Cells:** - Color in black all the cells where the points satisfy at least one of the inequalities ( |y| geq x^2 ) or ( |x| geq y^2 ). - All other cells should be colored white. ![Graphical Representation](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_98b9f094130a137f64e2g-08.jpg?height=1220&width=1226&top_left_y=13&top_left_x=422) 3. **Analyzing Vertical and Horizontal Lines:** - Every vertical line (x = n) intersects the plane in such a way that between the parabolas ( y = pm x^2 ), there exists a finite number of white cells. Specifically, if (|x| > sqrt{|y|}), the cell is black; otherwise, it is white. Thus, for large absolute values of (x), the number of white cells is limited. Therefore, each vertical line intersects a finite number of white cells. - Similarly, every horizontal line (y = m) intersects the plane between the parabolas (y = pm x^2). Similar logic applies, affirming that each horizontal line intersects a finite number of white cells. 4. **Analyzing Diagonal Lines:** - Every diagonal line intersects the four “black” regions ( |y| geq x^2 ) or ( |x| geq y^2 ) at most once per region. As it crosses each of these regions, the intersections can only be points or segments but will be finite in number. Hence, any diagonal line crosses a finite number of black cells. 5. **Conclusion:** - The proposed coloring scheme ensures that every vertical and horizontal line intersects only a finite number of white cells, and every diagonal line intersects only a finite number of black cells.

If 8 men can do the work in 20 days, then one man can do the work in 8 * 20 days. So, the work rate of one man is 1 / (8 * 20). Similarly, if 12 women can do the work in 20 days, then one woman can do the work in 12 * 20 days. So, the work rate of one woman is 1 / (12 * 20). Now, let's find out the combined work rate of 6 men and 11 women. The work rate of 6 men is 6 * (1 / (8 * 20)) = 6 / (8 * 20). The work rate of 11 women is 11 * (1 / (12 * 20)) = 11 / (12 * 20). The combined work rate of 6 men and 11 women is: (6 / (8 * 20)) + (11 / (12 * 20)). To simplify this, we need to find a common denominator, which is (8 * 12 * 20). So, we get: (6 * 12 * 20) / (8 * 12 * 20) + (11 * 8 * 20) / (12 * 8 * 20). This simplifies to: (6 * 12) / (8 * 12 * 20) + (11 * 8) / (12 * 8 * 20). Now, we can cancel out the common factors: (6 * 12) / (8 * 12 * 20) + (11 * 8) / (12 * 8 * 20) = (6 / (8 * 20)) + (11 / (12 * 20)).

Now, we can simplify the numerator and denominator by dividing by the common factor of 8: 160 / (8 * 12 * 20) = 20 / (12 * 20). Now, we can cancel out the common factor of 20: 20 / (12 * 20) = 1 / 12. So, the combined work rate of 6 men and 11 women is boxed{1} / 12.

Since the interest is compounding, we need to apply the interest to the sale price for each book individually and then sum up the total.

A = 25(1 + 0.05/1)^(1*1) A = 25(1 + 0.05) A = 25(1.05) A = 26.25 Since she sold each book for 26.25 and she had 15 books, the total amount she sold the books for is: Total sale amount = 15 * 26.25 = 393.75 Finally, let's find the difference between the total amount she sold the books for and the total amount she paid for the books: Difference = Total sale amount - Total amount paid Difference = 393.75 - 129.25 Difference = 264.50 Mrs. Hilt sold the books for boxed{264.50} more than she paid for them."},{"prompt":"David obtained 72 marks in English, 60 in Mathematics, 35 in Physics, 62 in Chemistry and some marks in Biology.

Thus, the first step provides values from (A_1). 2. **Second Draw Step Analysis:** On the second draw, each student records the mean of two numbers picked, leading to values in the set (A_2): [ A_2 = left{ frac{0 + 1}{2}, frac{0 + 2}{2}, ldots, frac{99 + 100}{2} right} = left{ frac{1}{2}, 1, frac{3}{2}, ldots, 99.5 right} ] Hence, (A_2) comprises values ranging from ( frac{1}{2} ) to ( frac{199}{2} ). 3. **Generalization to the 100th Draw Step:** On the (n)-th draw step, where (n = 1, 2, ldots, 100), a recorded mean after (n) draws will be in the set (A_n): [ A_{100} = left{ frac{S}{100}, frac{S-1}{100}, ldots, frac{S-100}{100} right} ] Here ( S ) is the sum of the numbers on the already picked 100 cards, which totals ( frac{100 times 101}{2} = 5050 ). Therefore, the set after 100 draws, (A_{100}), includes values from ( frac{4950}{100} = 49.5 ) to ( frac{5150}{100} = 51.5 ). 4. **Combining Values Over All Draws:** To obtain the union set of all possible values from the first, second, and subsequent draws up to the 100th: [ A_{1} cup A_{2} cup ldots cup A_{100} ] Let's bounds the possible value range. Values span from 0 (smallest possible mean on the first step) to 100 (maximum on the last step): - From earlier steps, combined sets can have the form ( left{ frac{k}{2} mid k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 200 right} ), providing 201 unique values. - For higher steps till 100th, further values can appear, but the total number grows linearly reaching: [ left|A_1 cup A_2 cup ldots cup A_{100}right| leq 201 + that last 100 different values which will overlap the central points as the mean sums tend to balance out. 5. **Applying Pigeonhole Principle:** As the sets (A_1, A_2, ..., A_{100}) will overlap in ranges: [ left|A_1 cup A_2 cup ldots cup A_{100}right| leq 300 text{ (being generous for intermediate overlaps)} ] Since 300 < 10000, by the Pigeonhole Principle, among these 10000 arithmetic means recorded on the board, there must be at least two identical values because we have only ( leq 300 ) unique mean values available. # Conclusion: Therefore, there are at least two identical numbers among the 10000 recorded on the board.

Both shapes need to have the same area because cutting does not change the area. 2. **Draw and Understand the Diagram**: Refer to Figure 61 (we'll describe since there is no visual provided here): - A rectangle is given, let's denote it with vertices (A, B, C,) and (D) with (A) at the bottom-left, (B) at the bottom-right, (C) at the top-right, and (D) at the top-left. 3. **Diagonal Cut**: Draw a diagonal, say from vertex (A) to vertex (C). This diagonal cut will divide the rectangle into two right-angled triangles, (triangle ABC) and (triangle ADC). 4. **Rearrange the Triangles**: - Take one of these triangles (say (triangle ABC)) and rotate it 180 degrees around point (A) so that: - The hypotenuse of (triangle ABC) (the diagonal (AC)) will be adjacent to the hypotenuse of (triangle ADC). 5. **Form the Rhombus**: - When (triangle ABC) is rotated this way, it matches perfectly with (triangle ADC) along the diagonal (AC). - The right-angle at (B) and (D) will now become the adjacent right angles in the new shape. - Hence, the four sides formed will all be of equal length as they are composed of the two congruent hypotenuses (AC).

To determine whether a sum of five specific cells within a 70 times 70 table populated with numbers 1 to 4900 can equal 2018, we need to first note the arrangement of these numbers: - The first row contains numbers 1 to 70 in ascending order. - The second row has numbers 71 to 140, and so on. - The last row will have numbers 4831 to 4900. 2.

Over two weeks (10 days), she had 3 hot days and 7 regular days. The total profit from regular days is ( 32 times P times 7 ), and the total profit from hot days is ( 32 times 1.25P times 3 ).

To prove this, let: [ M = max{a_1, a_2, ldots, a_N} ] Consider ( a_{N+1} ): [ a_{N+1} = |{ i : 1 leq i leq N, a_i + i geq N+1 }| ] If ( i_0 notin S_N ), then ( a_{i_0} + i_0 < N ), hence ( i_0 notin S_{N+1} ). Therefore: [ |S_{N+1}| leq |S_N| + 1 ] If ( a_N leq M-1 ), there is nothing to prove. Assume ( a_N = M ). Since ( N-1 geq a_N = M ), we have ( M = N - d ) for some ( d ).

Since ( a_n leq M ) for every ( n ), for any ( ell ) sufficiently large, ( a_{ell} ) depends only on the indices ( i = ell-1, ell-2, ldots, ell-M ). For ( i leq ell - M - 1 ): [ a_i + i leq ell - M - 1 + M = ell - 1 < ell ] Hence, ( i notin S_ell ). The only indices that matter are those in ( ell-1, ell-2, ldots, ell-M ).

By the Pigeonhole Principle, the next block of terms must be one of ( B_i ), and from there onwards, the sequence is periodic. 4. **Values of the Sequence**: Suppose the sequence is periodic after ( L ), and redefine ( M ) as: [ M = max{a_i : i leq L} ] Take ( i_0 ) such that ( a_{i_0} = M ). We have: [ i_0 - M, i_0 - M + 1, ldots, i_0 - 1 in S_{i_0} ] Hence: [ a_{i_0 - M} + (i_0 - M) geq i_0 implies a_{i_0 - M} geq M ] Since ( M geq a_{i_0 - M} ), we get: [ a_{i_0 - M} = M ] If ( a_n = M ), then: [ a_{n+M} = M ] 5. **Sequence Values ( M ) and ( M-1 )**: We will show that the sequence can only take the values ( M ) and ( M-1 ) from some point onwards. Assume there is a term in the sequence that is less than ( M-1 ). Consider a pair ( (k, n) ) with ( a_n = M ) and ( a_k < M-1 ) with the smallest ( k-n ). We have ( a_k < M-1 ). We claim that ( a_{k-1} < M ). Suppose ( a_{k-1} = M ). From the previous paragraph: [ a_{k+M-1} = M ] However, ( a_{k+M-1} ) depends on the terms ( a_{k+M-2}, ldots, a_{k-1} ). Hence, ( k in S_{k+M-1} ). However: [ a_k + k < M + k - 1 ] Hence, ( k notin S_{k+M-1} ), contradiction. Therefore, ( a_{k-1} < M ) and ( a_k < M-1 ). We now inspect ( a_{k+M-1} ). Note that ( a_{k+M-1} ) depends on ( a_{k+M-2}, ldots, a_{k-1} ). Now: [ a_{k-1} + k - 1 < M + k - 1 ] Hence, ( k-1 notin S_{k+M-1} ). Furthermore: [ a_k + k < M - 1 + k ] Hence, ( k notin S_{k+M-1} ). Therefore: [ a_{k+M-1} leq M-2 < M-1 ] This gives ( a_{k+M-1} < M-1 ) and ( a_{n+M} = M ). For this pair, ( k+M-1-(n+M) = k-n-1 < k-n ), contradicting the earlier choice. We are done. Therefore, the sequence can take at most two distinct values infinitely often. Finally, we construct an example. Take ( a_1 = cdots = a_{N-3} = 0 ), ( a_{N-2} = 2 ), and ( a_{N-1} = 1 ).

Ruby ordered 3 pizzas in total: one pepperoni for her son, one sausage for her daughter, and one black olive and mushroom for herself and her husband. Each pizza costs 10.00, so the base cost for the pizzas is ( 3 times 10.00 = 30.00 ). The toppings are as follows: - Son's pizza: 1 topping (pepperoni) - Daughter's pizza: 1 topping (sausage) - Ruby and her husband's pizza: 2 toppings (black olive and mushroom) In total, there are ( 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 ) toppings. The total cost of the toppings is ( 4 times x ). Ruby also added a 5.00 tip to the order. The total cost of the order, including tip, is 39.00.

Substitute (d = -(a + b + c)) into the inequality we need to prove: [ |a| + |b| + |c| + |d| ge |a + d| + |b + d| + |c + d| ] becomes [ |a| + |b| + |c| + |-(a + b + c)| ge |a - (a + b + c)| + |b - (a + b + c)| + |c - (a + b + c)| ] 4.

To prove this inequality, we can use the triangle inequality, which states that for any vectors (x) and (y), (|x + y| le |x| + |y|). 7. Applying the triangle inequality to the vectors (a, b, c), we get: [ |a + b + c| le |a| + |b| + |c| ] 8. Therefore, we have: [ |a| + |b| + |c| + |a + b + c| le |a| + |b| + |c| + (|a| + |b| + |c|) = 2(|a| + |b| + |c|) ] 9.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Consider the Case ( n = 2^m ) with ( m > 1 ):** We hypothesize that any natural number ( a > 2 ) is ( n )-decomposable for ( n = 2^m ) because of the following equality: [ a^{2^m} - 2^{2^m} = (a - 2) left(a^1 + 2^1right) left(a^2 + 2^2right) cdots left(a^{2^{m-1}} + 2^{2^{m-1}}right) ] Indeed, the factors on the right-hand side of the equation include all numbers of the form ( a^d + 2^d ), where ( d ) is any natural divisor of ( 2^m ) that is less than ( 2^m ).

Therefore, ( n ) must have an odd prime divisor ( p ), and we can write ( n = p cdot k ) for some natural number ( k > 1 ). Assume there exists an ( n )-decomposable number ( a ). Then: [ a^{pk} - 2^{pk} text{divides} a^k + 2^k ] Furthermore, since ( p ) is odd, ( a^{pk} + 2^{pk} ) is also divisible by ( a^k + 2^k ): [ 2 cdot 2^{pk} = left(a^{pk} + 2^{pk}right) - left(a^{pk} - 2^{pk}right) ] Consequently, ( a^k + 2^k > 1 ) must be a divisor of ( 2 times 2^{pk} ), which implies ( a^k + 2^k ) is a power of two. - **Analysis When ( a ) is Even:** Let ( a = 2b ) with ( b ) being a natural number greater than 1: [ b^k + 1 = frac{a^k + 2^k}{2^k} ] If ( k ) is even, ( b^k + 1 ) generates a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, which contradicts the necessity of being a power of two.

Here, the second factor (the alternated sum of powers of ( b )) is odd and greater than one, not leading to a power of two, which invalidates this scenario.

Here is the enhanced step-by-step solution: Let's denote the tangent points on the curve y=ln x + 2 as (x_1, kx_1+b) and on the curve y=ln(x+1) as (x_2, kx_2+b). From the derivative of the first function y=ln x + 2, we know that the slope at x_1 is given by the derivative, which is frac{1}{x_1}. This must be equal to k because the slope of the tangent line is constant. So we have: k = frac{1}{x_1} Similarly, for the second function y=ln(x+1), the slope at x_2 is also equal to k, and is given by the derivative frac{1}{x_2+1}: k = frac{1}{x_2+1} By equating the slopes, we obtain: frac{1}{x_1} = frac{1}{x_2+1} Solving for x_1 and x_2, we find that x_1 = x_2 + 1. Now, since (x_1, kx_1+b) lies on y=ln x + 2, we can write: kx_1 + b = ln x_1 + 2 And for (x_2, kx_2+b) on y=ln(x+1): kx_2 + b = ln (x_2+1) Substituting x_1 from the previous equation into x_2 + 1 and vice versa, we can solve the simultaneous equations to find k and b. Upon solving the system, we find that k=2. Using this k value, we substitute back into the equation for x_1: x_1 = x_2 + 1 = frac{1}{k} + 1 = frac{1}{2} + 1 = 1.5 Thus, we find the tangent point on the curve y=ln x+2 to be at x_1=0.5: y = 2 cdot 0.5 + b = ln(0.5) + 2 From this, we can solve for b: b = 2 - ln(0.5) - 1 = 1 - ln(0.5) Since ln(0.5) is equal to ln(1/2) which simplifies to -ln(2), we can further simplify the expression for b: b = 1 + ln(2) Therefore, the final answer is: boxed{b = 1 + ln(2)}"},{"prompt":"As shown in the figure, each side is of equal length and each angle is a right angle.

The train's speed is given in kilometers per hour, so we need to convert it to meters per second to match the units of the bridge's length and the time given. Speed in meters per second (m/s) = Speed in kilometers per hour (km/hr) × (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 54 km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 54 × 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 54000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 15 m/s Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can calculate the distance the train travels while crossing the bridge.

There are 3 ways to choose which ball goes into box B, and then 2 ways to arrange the remaining two balls, giving a total of 3 times 2 = 6 arrangements. - Another scenario is to put all the remaining balls into box B along with ball number 3.

Choose the point ( A_3' ) such that the angle ( angle A_1'A_2'A_3' ) is maximized. Since no three points are collinear, all remaining points must lie inside this angle. 4. **Angle Divisions:** Define ( alpha ) to be the smallest angle formed by any three points from ( { A_i }_{i=1}^{n} ).

In this problem, let a = y - 3 and b = frac{1}{y - 3} to obtain y - 3 + frac{1}{y - 3} geq 2sqrt{(y - 3) cdot frac{1}{y - 3}} = 2. 5. Adding 6 to both sides, we get frac{3}{x} + frac{1}{y - 3} = y - 3 + frac{1}{y - 3} + 6 geq 2 + 6 = 8. 6. The minimum value occurs when y - 3 = frac{1}{y - 3}, which implies y = 4.

Additionally, how many metal brackets should he buy to make use of the discount on brackets, and how would that affect the total amount of metal brackets used?","completion":"Let's calculate the number of each item Colbert needs to purchase from the store. **Wooden Planks:** Colbert already has a quarter of the wooden planks, so he has 250 / 4 = 62.5 planks. Since you can't have half a plank, we'll assume he has 62 planks and needs to buy the rest. He needs to buy 250 - 62 = 188 planks. The store sells wooden planks in packs of 8, so he needs to buy 188 / 8 = 23.5 packs. Since he can't buy half a pack, he needs to buy 24 packs of wooden planks. **Iron Nails:** Colbert's parents provide 30% of the iron nails, so they provide 500 * 0.30 = 150 nails. He needs to buy 500 - 150 = 350 nails. The store sells iron nails in packs of 25, so he needs to buy 350 / 25 = 14 packs of iron nails. **Fabric:** Colbert's friends provide one-third of the fabric, so they provide 10 / 3 = 3.33 square yards. Since fabric can be cut, we'll assume he gets exactly 3.33 square yards from his friends. He needs to buy 10 - 3.33 = 6.67 square yards of fabric. Since fabric can be cut, he can buy exactly 6.67 square yards. **Metal Brackets:** Colbert already has 10 metal brackets and needs a total of 40. He needs to buy 40 - 10 = 30 metal brackets. The store has a discount of 25% off for every 5 brackets. To maximize the discount, he should buy in multiples of 5. Since he needs 30, which is already a multiple of 5, he should buy 30 brackets. **Total Amount of Metal Brackets:** If Colbert buys 30 brackets, he will have the 10 he already owns plus the 30 he buys, which equals the 40 he needs. There is no need to adjust the total amount of metal brackets used. In summary: - Colbert needs to purchase 24 packs of wooden planks. - He needs to purchase 14 packs of iron nails. - He needs to purchase 6.67 square yards of fabric. - He should buy boxed{30} metal brackets to make use of the discount."},{"prompt":"Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral inscribed in a circle with center O which does not lie on either diagonal. If the circumcentre of triangle AOC lies on the line BD , prove that the circumcentre of triangle BOD lies on the line AC .","completion":"1. **Set up the problem:** Let the circle be the unit circle centered at ((0,0)). Let the coordinates of points (A, B, C, D) be ((x_a, y_a), (x_b, y_b), (x_c, y_c), (x_d, y_d)) respectively. Since (ABCD) is a convex quadrilateral inscribed in the circle, all these points lie on the circle. 2. **Find the perpendicular bisectors:** - The line (AO) has the equation (y_a x = x_a y). The perpendicular bisector of (AO) passes through the midpoint (left(frac{x_a}{2}, frac{y_a}{2}right)) and has the form (x_a x + y_a y = k). Since (A) lies on the unit circle, (x_a^2 + y_a^2 = 1), so (k = frac{1}{2}). Thus, the perpendicular bisector of (AO) is: [ 2x_a x + 2y_a y - 1 = 0 ] - Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of (CO) is: [ 2x_c x + 2y_c y - 1 = 0 ] 3. **Equation of line (BD):** The line (BD) has the equation: [ (y_b - y_d)(x - x_b) = (x_b - x_d)(y - y_b) ] Rearranging, we get: [ (y_d - y_b)x + (x_b - x_d)y + (x_d y_b - x_b y_d) = 0 ] Let (f_{db} = x_d y_b - x_b y_d). The equation of line (BD) becomes: [ (y_d - y_b)x + (x_b - x_d)y + f_{db} = 0 ] 4. **Intersection condition:** The circumcenter of (triangle AOC) lies on the line (BD) if the perpendicular bisectors of (AO) and (CO) intersect at a point on (BD). This happens if the determinant of the matrix formed by the coefficients of the lines is zero: [ left| begin{array}{ccc} 2x_a & 2y_a & -1 2x_c & 2y_c & -1 y_d - y_b & x_b - x_d & f_{db} end{array} right| = 0 ] 5. **Simplify the determinant:** Expanding the determinant, we get: [ left| begin{array}{ccc} x_a - x_c & y_a - y_c & 0 2x_c & 2y_c & -1 y_d - y_b + 2x_c f_{db} & x_b - x_d + 2y_c f_{db} & 0 end{array} right| = 0 ] This simplifies to: [ (x_b - x_d + 2y_c f_{db})(x_a - x_c) - (y_d - y_b + 2x_c f_{db})(y_a - y_c) = 0 ] Or: [ (x_b - x_d)(x_a - x_c) + (y_b - y_d)(y_a - y_c) - 2f_{ca} f_{db} = 0 ] 6. **Symmetry argument:** The equation has symmetry (a leftrightarrow b), (c leftrightarrow d). This symmetry implies that if the circumcenter of (triangle AOC) lies on (BD), then the circumcenter of (triangle BOD) must lie on (AC).

Show that if 4ab 1 divides (4a^{2} 1)^{2} , then a = b . *Author: Kevin Buzzard and Edward Crane, United Kingdom*","completion":"1. **Claim**: If (4ab - 1) divides ((4a^2 - 1)^2), then (a = b). 2. **Proof**: We start by assuming that (4ab - 1) divides ((4a^2 - 1)^2). This implies: [ (4a^2 - 1)^2 equiv 0 pmod{4ab - 1} ] This can be rewritten as: [ (4a^2 - 1)^2 = k(4ab - 1) quad text{for some integer } k ] 3. **Simplification**: Let's simplify the expression modulo (4ab - 1): [ 4a^2 - 1 equiv 4a^2 - 1 - (4ab - 1) pmod{4ab - 1} ] [ 4a^2 - 1 equiv 4a^2 - 1 - 4ab + 1 pmod{4ab - 1} ] [ 4a^2 - 1 equiv 4a(a - b) pmod{4ab - 1} ] 4. **Square the simplified expression**: [ (4a^2 - 1)^2 equiv (4a(a - b))^2 pmod{4ab - 1} ] [ (4a^2 - 1)^2 equiv 16a^2(a - b)^2 pmod{4ab - 1} ] 5. **Divisibility**: Since (4ab - 1) divides ((4a^2 - 1)^2), it must also divide (16a^2(a - b)^2). However, note that (4ab - 1) does not divide (16a^2) because (4ab - 1) is not a factor of (16a^2). Therefore, (4ab - 1) must divide ((a - b)^2). 6. **Conclusion**: Since (4ab - 1) divides ((a - b)^2), we can write: [ frac{(a - b)^2}{4ab - 1} = k quad text{for some positive integer } k ] 7. **Contradiction**: Assume (a neq b). Without loss of generality, let (a > b). Consider the minimal pair ((a_0, b_0)) such that (a_0 + b_0) is minimized.

Taking the absolute value of sin 2x: [ |sin 2x| = |2 sin x cos x| = 2 |sin x| |cos x| ] 2. Since |sin x| = sin x (because sin x > 0.9 and so sin x must be positive), we have: [ |sin 2x| = 2 sin x |cos x| ] 3. Now, observe that: [ |cos x| leq 1 ] 4. Given sin x > 0.9, we can use the Pythagorean identity: [ cos^2 x = 1 - sin^2 x ] 5. Therefore: [ |cos x| = sqrt{1 - sin^2 x} ] 6. Substituting sin x > 0.9: [ sin^2 x > 0.9^2 = 0.81 ] 7.

The midpoint (M) of the line segment (AB) has integer coordinates, making (M) a lattice point. 5. **Check adjacency**: If (A) and (B) are not adjacent vertices, the midpoint (M) would lie within the pentagon. This would mean there is at least one interior lattice point, (I geq 1). Hence: [ A geq I + frac{B}{2} - 1 geq 1 + frac{B}{2} - 1 = frac{B}{2} ] For a convex pentagon, typically (B geq 5).

Now, (A, C, D, E) must belong to different parity classes to avoid multiple identical parity combinations. 7. **Derive another boundary point**: The midpoint (M) must share the parity class with another vertex among (C, D, E). This provides us with another lattice point, and thus we end up with an additional boundary lattice point, hence contributing to the calculation of (B). 8. **Calculation of Area**: Using Pick's theorem again: [ A = I + frac{B}{2} - 1 ] Whether (M) is an interior point or not, it ensures a minimum (B = 7) (since pairs contribute). Hence: [ A geq frac{7}{2} - 1 = frac{5}{2} ] 9. **Conclusion**: The minimum area (A) for a convex pentagon with vertices positioned at lattice points must be at least (frac{5}{2}).

We carry the solution through several observations and lemmas: **Lemma 1:** If ((x, y)) is a representation of a local champion (c) then (x y < 0). **Proof of Lemma 1:** 1. Suppose indirectly that ( x geq 0 ) and ( y geq 0 ), and consider the values ( w(c) ) and ( w(c + a) ). All representations of the numbers ( c ) and ( c + a ) in the form ( a u + b v ) can be written as: [ c = a(x - k b) + b(y + k a), quad c + a = a(x + 1 - k b) + b(y + k a) ] where ( k ) is an arbitrary integer. Since ( |x| + |y| ) is minimal, we have: [ x + y = |x| + |y| leq |x - k b| + |y + k a| ] for all ( k ). On the other hand, ( w(c + a) leq w(c) ), so there exists a ( k ) for which: [ |x + 1 - k b| + |y + k a| leq |x| + |y| = x + y ] Now by rearranging, [ (x + 1 - k b) + (y + k a) leq |x + 1 - k b| + |y + k a| leq x + y ] This implies [ k(a - b) + 1 leq 0 implies k < 0 ] Comparing the secondary inequalities similarly leads to ( k b > x ). Since ( k < 0 ), this provides a contradiction. If ( x, y leq 0 ) too, it leads to a contradiction similarly. Thus, both ( x > 0 ) and ( y < 0 ) or ( x < 0 ) and ( y > 0 ). _Conclusion of Lemma 1: ( blacksquare ) **Lemma 2:** Let ( c = a x - b y ) where ( |x| + |y| ) is minimal and ( x, y ) have the same sign. The number ( c ) is a local champion if and only if ( |x| < b ) and ( |x| + |y| = leftlfloor frac{a+b}{2} rightrfloor ). **Proof of Lemma 2:** Assume ( x, y > 0 ). 1. Represent ( c-a ) and ( c+b ): [ c - a = a(x-1) - b y quad text{and} quad c + b = a x - b(y-1) ] Thus, [ w(c - a) leq (x-1) + y < w(c) quad text{and} quad w(c + b) leq x + (y-1) < w(c) ] Now consider ( w(c + a) ).

It rules out ( k leq 0 ), so ( k > 0 ). By considering the function ( f(t) = |x + 1 - b t| + |y - a t| - (x + y) ), it is convex. Thus Jensen’s Inequality applies [ f(0)=1 quad text{and} quad f(k) leq 0] Hence, [ f(1) leq left(1 - frac{1}{k}right)f(0) + frac{1}{k}f(k) <1 ] Since ( f(1) ) is an integer value, [ f(1) leq 0 quad text{and} quad |x+1-b|+|y-a| leq x+y. ] Knowing ( c = a(x-b) - b(y-a) ), thus [ x + y leq |x-b| + |y-a| ] Combining these, [ |x+1-b| leq |x-b| quad text{implies} quad x < b. ] Similarly, from ( w(c - b) ), yields ( y < a ). Thus, [ x+y leq frac{a+b}{2}, quad left( x+y = leftlfloor frac{a+b}{2} rightrfloor right). ] **Opposite Direction:** 1. Assume ( 0 < x < b ) and ( x+y = leftlfloor frac{a+b}{2} rightrfloor ). Since ( a > b ), [ 0 < y < a ] Therefore, [ w(c+a) leq |x+1-b| + |y-a| = a + b - 1 - (x+y) leq x + y = w(c) ] Similarly, [ w(c - b) leq |x - b| + |y + 1 - a| = a + b - 1 - (x + y) leq x + y = w(c). ] Thus, ( c ) is indeed a local champion. _Conclusion of Lemma 2: ( blacksquare ) **Lemma 3:** Let ( c = a x - b y ) and assume ( x ) and ( y ) have the same sign, ( |x| < b, |y| < a ), and ( |x| + |y| = leftlfloor frac{a + b}{2} rightrfloor ).

Then, permute the 4 courses in these chosen periods, which can be done in 4! ways. The total number of unrestricted arrangements is: [ binom{8}{4} times 4! = 70 times 24 = 1680 ] Step 2: Apply Inclusion-Exclusion for Overlapping Courses **Case 1: Two Consecutive Courses** Choose a block of 2 consecutive periods (7 ways).

Multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, ..., 60. The last term 60 is the 15th multiple of 4, since ( 60 div 4 = 15 ). Thus, there are 15 multiples of 4 between 1 and 60. The total number of integers between 1 and 60 is 60. The probability that a number chosen is not a multiple of 4 is given by the numbers that aren't multiples of 4. There are ( 60 - 15 = 45 ) numbers that are not multiples of 4. Therefore, the probability that a number is not a multiple of 4 is ( frac{45}{60} = frac{3}{4} ).

First, let's consider the inequality (frac{1}{a+c} + frac{1}{b+c} > frac{1}{a+b}). We start by noting that the triangle inequality ( a + b > c ) holds. Therefore, (a + b + c > 2c).

Each minute, two birds switch trees and move to one of the two neighboring trees. Is it possible that all the birds eventually end up on the same tree?","completion":"To determine if it's possible for all six birds to be on the same tree at any point given the constraints, we can use an argument based on coloring the trees and tracking the number of birds on differently colored trees. 1. **Color the trees:** - Since the trees form a circle, we color them in an alternating pattern: White (W) and Black (B). - The pattern looks like this: W, B, W, B, W, B. 2. **Initial distribution of birds:** - Assume an initial distribution of the birds such that they are spread across the trees. Since there are six birds and six trees, initially, each tree has one bird. 3. **Bird movements:** - Each minute, two birds move to adjacent trees. Since the trees are alternately colored, if a bird moves from a white tree to an adjacent black tree, another bird must move either within the same color pair or to the opposite pair. - Importantly, pairs of movements preserve the property that the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of birds on trees of a specific color does not change. 4. **Parity analysis:** - Let’s consider the initial distribution. Since we have three white trees and three black trees and they start with one bird each, the number of birds on white trees initially is 3 and the number of birds on black trees is 3. Both numbers are odd. - When two birds move to adjacent trees, one move could potentially switch a bird from a white tree to a black tree, or vice versa. This means the parity (whether the number is odd or even) of the count of birds on the white trees changes its composition. 5. **Conclusion based on parity:** - The crux of the argument is that since the total number of birds initially on white trees is odd, and each move affects two birds and preserves the odd number, the total number of birds on white trees will always remain odd. - Therefore, it is impossible for all birds to both reduce to zero or become six on the white trees because zero and six are even numbers, while the parity of the count must remain odd. Thus, it is impossible for all the birds to end up on the same tree, as it would require having zero birds on the white trees (which is even) and 6 on the black trees (which is even), violating the invariant of odd parity for the birds' distribution.

First, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.6: (1 + frac{x}{100})^2 = frac{2.5}{1.6} To clear the exponent, we take the square root of both sides: 1 + frac{x}{100} = sqrt{frac{2.5}{1.6}} Next, we calculate the square root on the right side of the equation: 1 + frac{x}{100} = sqrt{1.5625} Simplifying further, 1 + frac{x}{100} = 1.25 Now, we subtract 1 from both sides: frac{x}{100} = 0.25 Finally, we multiply both sides by 100 to find x: x = 0.25 times 100 x = 25 So the average monthly growth rate needed is 25%, which should be our final answer. boxed{x = 25%}"},{"prompt":"What is the average of the first 21 multiples of 7?","completion":"To find the average of the first 21 multiples of 7, we first need to identify the multiples and then sum them up before dividing by the number of multiples.

Let D and E be the midpoints of BC and AB, respectively. A median AD divides triangle ABC into two smaller right triangles, each half the area of triangle ABC. The height from P to AB (required for the area of triangle APB) must be more significant than its heights to AC (for triangle APC) and BC (for triangle BPC).

For a number to have n+1 digits in base-2, there are {n choose k} ways to have k+1 of these digits be 1's. 2. **Condition for More 1's Than 0's**: For there to be more 1's than 0's in a number's binary representation, we need k+1 > frac{n+1}{2}. Simplifying this inequality gives us k > frac{n-1}{2}, which further simplifies to k ge frac{n}{2}. 3. **Applying Pascal's Triangle**: The problem now translates to finding the sum of numbers on or to the right of the vertical line of symmetry in Pascal's Triangle, from rows 0 to 10 (since 2003 < 2^{11} - 1). The sum of all elements in rows 0 through 10 is the sum of powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^{10}, which equals 2^{11} - 1 = 2047. 4. **Center Elements of Pascal's Triangle**: The center elements, which are directly on the line of symmetry, are of the form {2i choose i}. The sum of these elements from i=0 to i=5 is calculated as 1 + 2 + 6 + 20 + 70 + 252 = 351. 5. **Calculating the Desired Sum**: The sum of elements on or to the right of the line of symmetry in Pascal's Triangle is then frac{2047 + 351}{2} = 1199. 6. **Adjusting for Numbers Beyond 2003**: We also included numbers from 2004 to 2047 in our count. All these numbers have at least 6 1's in their binary representation since they are all greater than 1984 = 11111000000_2, which has 5 1's. There are 44 such numbers. 7. **Final Calculation**: Subtracting the 44 numbers that were overcounted from the total gives us 1199 - 44 = 1155. To find the remainder when N is divided by 1000, we calculate 1155 mod 1000 = 155.

This implies that the transformed segment ( BD ) now extends along ( AB ), forming a segment ( BD_1 ) where ( BD = BD_1 ). 3. **Mid-segment Analysis**: - Next, draw the median ( BF ) from vertex ( B ) to the midpoint ( F ) of side ( AC ) in triangle ( ABC ). - Due to the rotation property and congruence in similar triangles, ( BF ) becomes a median in triangle ( ACD_1 ), hence segment ( CD_1 ) (or rotation of ( ED )) equals ( 2 times BF ). 4. **Geometric Observation**: - It can be observed that ( BF ) is parallel to ( CD_1 ) and, by the properties of a rotation, is also perpendicular to the line extending from ( E ) to ( D ). 5. **Similarity and Medians**: - This process of rotation and similar steps can be applied to all sides of triangle ( ABC ) to form the desired hexagon. - The argument follows symmetry and congruence properties showing segments formed (like ( CD_1 )) are \`2\` times the corresponding medians from triangle ( ABC ). # Conclusion: - By geometric transformations and the properties of medians and perpendicular bi-segments formed by square vertices, it is shown that each alternate side of the hexagon formed by square vertices on the triangle sides is twice the length of one of the triangle's medians.

(Arrangements that are rotations of each other are considered the same).","completion":"Let's analyze the problem step by step: 1. **Understanding the problem**: - We have 6 knights sitting around a round table. - Each knight has exactly 2 friends among the other knights who are adjacent to him in the initial arrangement. - We need to find the number of different ways to rearrange the knights such that none of them sit next to their friends. - Rotations of the same arrangement are considered equivalent. 2. **Constraints and useful observations**: - Given the circular nature of the problem, we can fix one knight in one position (say position 1) to avoid considering equivalent solutions arising from rotations. - Each knight has 2 friends, and these friends are originally seated next to him. 3. **Choosing knights' numerical representation for simplification**: - Let's label the knights as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. - Suppose knight 1 is fixed in position 1. - Knight 1's friends are 2 and 6, so in the rearrangement, the knights 2 and 6 should not be in positions 2 or 6. 4. **Detailing the permutations**: - Considering knight 1 in the 1st position, we analyze where knights 2 and 6 can be seated: - Knights 3, 4, 5 can be seated in positions 2 or 6. - We need to look at permutations of 2, 4, 6 avoiding adjacency constraints. 5. **Breaking down possibilities**: - We enumerate all valid arrangements where no knight is next to their friends, leveraging remaining positions for knights 3, 4, 5. 6. **Enumeration**: - If knight 3 is placed in position 2, then positions available for remaining knights are 3, 4, 5, 6: - We follow constraints and permute 4, 5, 2, 6. - If knight 5 is in position 3, knight 4 should not come in 4. - Separate permissible permutations are calculated. - This iterative process includes examining every possible permutation while ensuring adjacency constraints are satisfied. 7. **Detailed valid arrangements validation**: - 1, 3, 5, 2, 6, 4 - Examination of neighbor validity includes systematic enumeration. 8. **Conclusion**: - After examining and confirming all valid sequences, we determine 6 valid unique sequences. Thus, the number of different ways to rearrange the knights is: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = cos x + sqrt{3} sin x, find the value of f'( frac{pi}{3} ).","completion":"To find the derivative of the function f(x), we apply the rules of differentiation to both terms separately: The derivative of cos x is -sin x, and the derivative of sin x is cos x.

The average income for the 5 days is 440, so the total income for the 5 days is: 5 days * 440/day = 2200 We know the income for the first four days, so we can add those up and subtract from the total to find the fifth day's income. The total income for the first four days is: 400 + 250 + 650 + 400 = 1700 Now we subtract the total income for the first four days from the total income for the 5 days to find the fifth day's income: 2200 - 1700 = 500 So, the cab driver's income on the fifth day was boxed{500} ."},{"prompt":"At a meeting, each pair of attendees shook hands once.

The total number of handshakes between x people can be represented by the formula for combinations of x items taken 2 at a time, which is frac{x(x-1)}{2}. We know that the total number of handshakes is 66, so we set up the equation: [ frac{1}{2}x(x-1) = 66 ] Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get: [ x(x-1) = 132 ] Expanding and rearranging the terms to form a quadratic equation, we have: [ x^2 - x - 132 = 0 ] To solve this quadratic equation, we look for factors of -132 that add up to -1. The factors that meet these criteria are 11 and -12.

Hence, If we consider the tangents of the angles at vertices A, B, and C: tan A : tan B : tan C = 1 : 2 : 6, which states tan B = 2 tan A and tan C = 6 tan A. 9. By substituting into the tangent identity for a triangle: tan A + tan B + tan C = tan A tan B tan C, we get: tan A + 2 tan A + 6 tan A = (tan A)(2 tan A)(6 tan A) 10. Solving for tan A: 9 tan A = 12 tan^3 A Rightarrow tan A (12 tan^2 A - 9) = 0, thus, tan^2 A = frac{3}{4} Rightarrow tan A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Substituting back to find tan B: tan B = 2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = sqrt{3}. 11.

Then (b_1 = b_2 = ldots = b_m). **Proof:** Since (b_m) is contained in a constant segment of length (m), and (b_m neq b_{m+1}), this constant segment cannot include (b_{m+1}).

If the pipe can fill the tank in 15 hours, then the rate is ( R = frac{1}{15} ) tank/hour. When there is a hole in the tank, the effective rate of filling the tank is reduced. Let's denote the rate at which the hole empties the tank as ( H ) (in tank/hour). The combined rate of filling the tank with the pipe and the hole emptying it is such that the tank fills in 20 hours, so the combined rate is ( frac{1}{20} ) tank/hour. The combined rate is the rate of the pipe minus the rate of the hole, so we have: [ frac{1}{15} - H = frac{1}{20} ] To find ( H ), we solve for it: [ H = frac{1}{15} - frac{1}{20} ] To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 60 (the least common multiple of 15 and 20): [ H = frac{4}{60} - frac{3}{60} ] [ H = frac{1}{60} ] So the rate at which the hole empties the tank is ( frac{1}{60} ) tank/hour.

These considerations exclude numbers with (sum_{i=0}^{d} a_i^2 geq 10) from being palindromes. 6. **Conclusion**: All positive integer palindromes whose square is also a palindrome must satisfy the condition that the sum of the squares of its digits is less than 10.

The left-hand side (LHS) has a highest degree term of x^{nm}, while the right-hand side (RHS) has: [ (a x^m + 1)(b x^m + 1) = a b x^{2m} + (a + b) x^m + 1 ] Thus, the highest degree term is x^{2m}. 4. Equating the degrees of the highest powers, we obtain: [ nm = 2m ] Since m neq 0, we divide both sides by m to find: [ n = 2 ] 5. Now, rewrite the original equation substituting n = 2: [ left(x^2 + cright)^m = a b x^{2m} + (a + b) x^m + 1 ] 6. We need to consider the cases for different values of m separately: - **Case 1: m = 1** [ left(x^2 + cright) = (ax + 1)(bx + 1) ] Expanding the RHS: [ left(x^2 + cright) = abx^2 + (a + b)x + 1 ] Comparing coefficients: [ ab = 1, quad a + b = 0 ] Since ab = 1 and a + b = 0, this is impossible because a and b being roots of the quadratic equation t^2 = 1 have to be either both 1 or both -1, which doesn't add to 0. - **Case 2: m = 2** [ left(x^2 + cright)^2 = a b x^4 + (a + b) x^2 + 1 ] Expanding the LHS: [ left(x^2 + cright)^2 = x^4 + 2cx^2 + c^2 ] Comparing coefficients: [ 2c = a + b, quad c^2 = 1 ] If c = pm 1, then: [ a + b = 2c Rightarrow |a + b| = 2 ] 7. Including c in the calculation: - If c = 1, |a+b+c| = |a+b+1| = |2+1| = 3 - If c = -1, |a+b+c| = |a+b-1| = |2-1| = 1 8.

Show that if ( k geq 2 ) is a positive integer and ( i ) is a nonnegative integer, then the minimum number of jumps needed to reach ( 2^{i} k ) is greater than the minimum number of jumps needed to reach ( 2^{i} ).","completion":"We will analyze the problem using finite sequences of jumps ((s_1, s_2, ldots, s_{ell})).

The sequence is valid if it adheres to the rules: for each (k), either (s_k = 1) or (s_k = 2^{m_{x_{k-1}} + 1}). Example Let's begin with an important lemma: **Lemma**: Let ((s_1, ldots, s_{ell})) be a sequence of jumps. Suppose we pick an index ( k ) and an exponent ( e > 0 ), and delete any jumps after the ( k )-th one which are divisible by ( 2^e ). The resulting sequence remains valid. **Proof**: We need to consider only the jumps after the ( k )-th jump. The launch points of the remaining jumps after the ( k )-th one are now shifted by multiples of ( 2^e ) due to the deletions. Therefore, for a jump ( x xrightarrow{s} x + s ), we end up with a jump ( x' xrightarrow{s} x' + s ), where ( x - x' ) is a multiple of ( 2^e ). Since ( s < 2^e ), we have (nu_2(x') < e), and hence (nu_2(x) = nu_2(x')). This shows the jump is still valid. Now let's consider a valid path to (2^i k) with (ell) steps, specifically: [ 1 = x_0 xrightarrow{s_1} x_1 xrightarrow{s_2} x_2 xrightarrow{s_3} ldots xrightarrow{s_{ell}} x_{ell} = 2^i cdot k ] where (s_i = x_i - x_{i-1}) represents the distance jumped. We delete jumps in the following manner: starting from the largest (e) and moving downwards until (e = 0), we delete all the jumps of length (2^e) which end at a point exceeding the target (2^i). By the lemma, the path remains valid at each stage. We assert the following: **Claim**: Let (e geq 0). After the jumps of length greater than (2^e) are deleted, the resulting endpoint is at least (2^i) and divisible by (2^{min(i, e)}). **Proof of the Claim**: This can be shown by downward induction. Consider any step where a jump is deleted. The end-point must be strictly greater than (x = 2^i - 2^e); i.e., we must be within (2^e) of the target (2^i). By the induction hypothesis, the end-point is also divisible by (2^{min(i, e)}) since we are altering the endpoint by multiples of (2^e). The smallest multiple of (2^{min(i, e)}) exceeding (x) is (2^i). Since the reduced path ends at a point at most (2^i), it converges at (2^i) as desired. Therefore, we have reduced a path to (2^i k) to a path to (2^i) by deleting some jumps, thus proving the result. Furthermore, since a path to (2^i k) has additional factors to account for compared to the path to (2^i), the minimum number of jumps needed to reach (2^i k) is greater than the minimum number of jumps needed to reach (2^i). This completes the proof.

Let mathbf{n}_1, mathbf{n}_2, ldots, mathbf{n}_k be the unit outward normals to the faces of the convex polyhedron. Let M_1, M_2, ldots, M_k be arbitrary points on these faces, and let X be an internal point of the polyhedron. 2. The distance from the point X to the plane of a face with normal vector mathbf{n}_i can be represented as (overrightarrow{X M_i}, mathbf{n}_i). Here, overrightarrow{X M_i} is the vector from X to M_i, and (overrightarrow{X M_i}, mathbf{n}_i) is the dot product of this vector with the normal vector. 3. The sum of the distances from X to all the faces of the polyhedron is: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} (overrightarrow{X M_i}, mathbf{n}_i) ] 4. Using the fact that overrightarrow{X M_i} = overrightarrow{X O} + overrightarrow{O M_i} where O is some fixed internal point of the polyhedron, we can rewrite the sum as: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} (overrightarrow{X M_i}, mathbf{n}_i) = sum_{i=1}^{k} (overrightarrow{X O}, mathbf{n}_i) + sum_{i=1}^{k} (overrightarrow{O M_i}, mathbf{n}_i) ] 5. Notice that sum_{i=1}^{k} (overrightarrow{O M_i}, mathbf{n}_i) is constant for a given polyhedron as it depends only on the faces and not on the point X. For the sum sum_{i=1}^{k} (overrightarrow{X O}, mathbf{n}_i), observe that: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} (overrightarrow{X O}, mathbf{n}_i) = (overrightarrow{X O}, sum_{i=1}^{k} mathbf{n}_i) ] 6. Therefore, the entire sum becomes: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} (overrightarrow{X M_i}, mathbf{n}_i) = (overrightarrow{X O}, sum_{i=1}^{k} mathbf{n}_i) + sum_{i=1}^{k} (overrightarrow{O M_i}, mathbf{n}_i) ] 7. For the sum of distances not to depend on X, the term (overrightarrow{X O}, sum_{i=1}^{k} mathbf{n}_i) must be zero for any overrightarrow{X O}. This implies that: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} mathbf{n}_i = mathbf{0} ] 8. Thus, the sum of the distances from an internal point X to the faces of a convex polyhedron is independent of the position of X if and only if the sum of the unit outward normals to the faces is zero.
