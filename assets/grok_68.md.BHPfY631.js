Since ( a_2 + a_3 + cdots + a_k ) and ( a_{k+1} + a_{k+2} + cdots + a_{2k-1} ) are each divisible by ( k ) (from (2) and (3)), their sums contribute factors of ( k ) to our total sum. 6. **Conclude divisibility of ( a_1 ):** With ( a_1 ) remaining, it must be divisible by both ( k ) and ( 2k), necessitating that ( a_1 ) is divisible by ( k ) for any arbitrary ( k ).

This implies that ω = frac{1}{2} and the function is y = sqrt{2}sin(frac{1}{2}x + φ).

This means that for every kilogram he claims to sell, he actually gives the customer less, and the difference in weight is his profit percentage. Let's denote the actual weight the dealer gives for a kilogram as W kg. Given that the dealer's profit percent is 8.695652173913047%, we can express this as a decimal by dividing by 100: Profit percent = 8.695652173913047 / 100 = 0.08695652173913047 The profit percent represents the fraction of the kilogram that the dealer keeps as profit.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of the Least Common Multiple (LCM) and how it determines the numbers in the pyramid bricks. Let's start from the bottom bricks A and B. 2.

The brick C is the LCM of numbers (13) (a given number) and A (one of the divisors of 30). Since A is a divisor of 30, the calculation of C depends on A but always involves 13. 4. Recall that the LCM of any number and one of its divisors (d) is the larger number. Thus, the expression for C will depend on each pair ((13, d)): - Since 13 is a prime number, it has no common divisors with 30, meaning the LCM of (13) and any non-trivial divisor of 30 will be (13 times d), where d in {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}). 5. We need to analyze the brick E. Brick E is the LCM of bricks C and 30: - Let's choose A as an example where A = 1. Then (C = text{LCM}(13, 1) = 13). - So, the LCM with 30 and 13 is text{LCM}(30, 13). Recognizing that 13 is a prime number and has no common factors with 30, the LCM is just (13 times 30 = 390). 6. This same logic can be applied to any divisors of 30 for A. Hence, E in every case simplifies to being the least common multiple of (13) and (30). 7. Similarly, brick F which considers (14) and B follows the same logic. Since 14 = 2 cdot 7: - LCM of (14) and 30 is the smallest number that both 14 and 30 divide. With a prime factor breakdown, we get: [ 30 = 2 times 3 times 5 ] [ 14 = 2 times 7 ] - Thus, merge these to get (text{LCM}(14, 30) = 2 times 3 times 5 times 7 = 210). 8.

We will find out how much the sum has increased by comparing the additions and subtractions: [ 401 - 329 = 72 ] 2. To keep the sum the same, we need to subtract 72 from the third number. 3. Thus, we should subtract ( 72 ) from the third number so that the total sum remains unchanged. Second method of solving: 1. Let ( a, b, c ) be the first, second, and third numbers respectively. According to the given condition, their sum is: [ a + b + c = 1281 ] 2. The first number is decreased by 329: [ a - 329 ] 3. The second number is increased by 401: [ b + 401 ] 4. Hence, the new sum of the first two numbers becomes: [ (a - 329) + (b + 401) = a + b + 72 ] 5. To keep the sum of the three numbers ( a, b, c ) the same as the original sum of ( 1281 ), the third number must be adjusted accordingly: [ a + b + 72 + c' = 1281 ] where ( c' ) represents the new value of the third number. 6.

Let's begin with the condition: If a triangle can be divided into two similar triangles by a line segment, the line segment must pass through one of the vertices of the triangle. Otherwise, it would divide the triangle into a quadrilateral and a triangle, not two triangles. 2. Let ( e ) be the line segment that divides the triangle into two similarly shaped triangles. Suppose ( triangle ABC ) is divided by ( e ), and ( e ) intersects the side opposite to vertex ( C ) at point ( M ). 3. First, consider a right triangle ( triangle ABC ). Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal. Thus, when dividing a right triangle ( triangle ABC ) into two similar triangles, the produced triangles must also be right triangles with a common angle. This scenario is only achievable if the segment ( e ) goes through the vertex ( C ) where the right angle is located and is perpendicular to the hypotenuse ( AB ). This creates two right triangles, each similar to the original right triangle ( triangle ABC ). 4. Consequently, if ( triangle ABC ) is a right triangle, it is possible to divide it into two similar triangles. This confirms that in the case of right triangles, the division condition holds. 5. Now, let's examine if a non-right triangle can be divided in such a manner. Consider a non-right triangle ( triangle ABC ), where ( e ) intersects the side opposite to vertex ( C ) at point ( M ). This intersection creates an acute angle and an obtuse angle, or possibly two right angles at ( M ). If the two resulting triangles are similar to the original ( triangle ABC ), the original triangle must possess both an angle with a single arc and an angle with a double arc. However, this is impossible since the sum of these angles exceeds ( 180^circ ), which violates the triangle angle sum property. The sum of any two angles in a triangle must be less than ( 180^circ ). 6. If both resulting angles are right angles, then the original triangle must be a right triangle contrary to the given condition of it being a non-right triangle. # Conclusion: We have shown that if a triangle can be divided into two similar triangles, the original triangle must be a right triangle.

These midlines divide triangle ABC into four smaller triangles, each having half the base and the same height as one of the larger triangle's sides, thus having one-quarter of the area of triangle ABC. 2. **Relationship between A_1B_1C_1 and PQR**: Triangle A_1B_1C_1 is similar to triangle ABC with a scale factor of 1/2.

For the second sector, we have ( m-1 ) choices to ensure that it is a different color from the first sector. Thus, [ a_2(m) = m(m-1) ] 2. **Recurrence Relation**: For ( n geq 2 ), consider the following: - For the first sector ( S_1 ), there are ( m ) possible colors. - For ( S_2 ), there are ( m-1 ) choices (since it must be different from ( S_1 )). - This process continues similarly for sectors ( S_3, S_4, ldots, S_{n-1} ). - For ( S_n ), there are again ( m-1 ) choices to ensure ( S_n ) is different from ( S_{n-1} ), but it is not necessarily different from ( S_1 ).

Thus, |AM| = sqrt{left(-frac{8k}{1 + 4k^2}right)^2 + left(frac{-8k^2}{1 + 4k^2}right)^2} = frac{8ksqrt{1+k^2}}{1 + 4k^2}. Similarly, we find |AN| = frac{8sqrt{1+k^2}}{4 + k^2}. Since |AM| = |AN|, we have k(4+k^2) = 1 + 4k^2, which leads to k^3 - 4k^2 + 4k - 1 = 0.

First, let's check the divisibility rule for 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is also divisible by 9. Let's apply this rule to the number A15B94: A + 1 + 5 + B + 9 + 4 = A + B + 19 For this sum to be divisible by 9, A + B + 19 must be a multiple of 9. The smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 19 is 27, and the next is 36, and so on. Since A and B are single-digit numbers, their maximum sum is 9 + 9 = 18. Adding 18 to 19 gives us 37, which is not a multiple of 9. So we need to find a value for A + B that, when added to 19, gives us a multiple of 9 that is less than or equal to 27. The only possible value for A + B that satisfies this condition is 8, because 19 + 8 = 27, which is a multiple of 9. So, A + B must equal 8. Now, let's check the divisibility rule for 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11. Let's apply this rule to the number A15B94: (A + 5 + 9) - (1 + B + 4) = (A + 14) - (B + 5) = A - B + 9 For this difference to be divisible by 11, A - B + 9 must be a multiple of 11. Since A and B are single-digit numbers, the possible values for A - B range from -8 to 8. Adding 9 to these values gives us a range from 1 to 17. The only multiple of 11 in this range is 11 itself. Therefore, A - B must equal 2, because 2 + 9 = 11. We have two equations now: 1. A + B = 8 2. A - B = 2 Adding these two equations together, we get: 2A = 10 A = 5 Substituting A = 5 into the first equation: 5 + B = 8 B = 8 - 5 B = 3 Therefore, the value of B that makes the number A15B94 divisible by 99 is boxed{3} ."},{"prompt":"Let the graph of the function f(x)=3sin (2x frac {pi}{3}) be denoted as C.

Let's denote the center of the 9x9 board as ( (5, 5) ). Following this, every time the second player makes a move, the first player should respond by placing a mark in the cell that is symmetric relative to the center of the board. For instance, if the second player places a mark at ( (i, j) ), then the first player should place a mark at ( (10-i, 10-j) ). This ensures that no matter how the second player plays, the board will maintain symmetry concerning the center. 2. **Symmetry Maintenance**: By maintaining the described symmetry, every move by the second player will be countered in a way that the positions ( (i, j) ) and ( (10-i, 10-j) ) will hold a cross and a circle, respectively. 3. **Final Board Configuration Analysis**: In the final position, in every pair of cells symmetric to each other with respect to the center, there will be one cross and one circle. This symmetry implies that there will be more crosses in the central row and the central column as these rows and columns are counted twice in the symmetry strategy. Thus, the central row and column will favor crosses over circles. 4. **Calculation of mathbf{B}**: At the end of the game, let's analyze the rows and columns: - Central row ( (5, j) ) for ( j = 1, 2, ldots, 9 ) will contain more crosses than circles. - Central column ( (i, 5) ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 9 ) will also contain more crosses than circles. - For every non-central row and column, there exists a symmetric counterpart that balances the number of crosses and circles. Therefore, we conclude that there will be exactly two advantageous lines (central row and column) for the first player. 5. **Second Player's Strategy to Ensure mathbf{B} Does Not Exceed 2**: The second player can assure that the first player’s advantage does not exceed 2 by following this strategy: - If the second player has the opportunity to place a mark in the cell symmetric to the one currently occupied by the first player, they should do so. - If the central cell has already been occupied, the second player should place their marks such that each move counteracts the symmetry maintained by the first player.

Let ( M ) be the centroid of base ( ABC ). The perpendiculars ( OA ) and ( PM ) are both perpendicular to the plane ( ABC ), hence they are parallel and lie in the same plane. 2. **Define the Necessary Lengths:** Calculate the distance ( PM ), the distance from ( P ) to the centroid ( M ) of triangle ( ABC ): [ PM = sqrt{AP^2 - AM^2} ] Since ( AP = b ) and ( AM = frac{asqrt{3}}{3} ): [ PM = sqrt{b^2 - left(frac{asqrt{3}}{3}right)^2} = sqrt{b^2 - frac{a^2}{3}} ] 3. **Analyze the Trapezoid ( OAMP ):** The trapezoid ( OAMP ) has perpendicular distances dropping from ( O ) to the base ( PM ) prescribed by ( OF ).

This implies that the integers must take values such that they cancel each other out in pairs (because they are integers and the sum must be zero). 2. **Characterization of the Integers:** Notice that the product of 22 integers is 1. For the product of 22 integers to be 1, the integers can only be 1 or -1 (since any other integer multiplied would not result in 1). Let a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{22} be the 22 integers, each being either 1 or -1. 3. **Sum Condition:** For the sum of these numbers to be zero, the number of 1s must equal the number of -1s. Let k be the number of 1s, and 22-k be the number of -1s. Therefore, we require: [ 1 cdot k + (-1) cdot (22 - k) = 0 ] Simplifying, we get: [ k - (22 - k) = 0 implies k = 11 ] Therefore, there must be exactly 11 ones and 11 minus ones. 4. **Product Condition:** However, if there are exactly 11 ones and 11 minus ones, let's compute the product of these integers: [ 1 cdot 1 cdot 1 cdot ldots cdot 1 cdot (-1) cdot (-1) cdot (-1) cdot ldots cdot (-1) ] Since there are 11 minus ones, the product will be: [ 1^{11} times (-1)^{11} = 1 times (-1) = -1 ] However, the given product of all 22 integers is 1, not -1.

Notice that this homothety transforms the plane (BCD) into a plane that is parallel to (BCD), and it tangentially touches the inscribed sphere at point (Z). 4.

How much did Chloe charge for half a dozen strawberries?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total cost for Chloe to buy 50 dozens of chocolate-dipped strawberries. Cost per dozen = 50 Total dozens bought = 50 Total cost = Cost per dozen * Total dozens bought Total cost = 50 * 50 Total cost = 2500 Chloe made a profit of 500 after selling 50 dozens. So, the total revenue from selling 50 dozens is the total cost plus the profit. Total revenue = Total cost + Profit Total revenue = 2500 + 500 Total revenue = 3000 Now, let's find out how much revenue Chloe made per dozen. Revenue per dozen = Total revenue / Total dozens sold Revenue per dozen = 3000 / 50 Revenue per dozen = 60 Chloe sold the strawberries for 60 per dozen.

After the addition, the five new data points compared to the original five data points, the one that remains unchanged is: A: Mean B: Mode C: Median D: Variance","completion":"To solve this problem, let's analyze the impact of adding 10 to each donation on the mean, mode, median, and variance of the original data points. Original data points: 20, 20, 30, 40, 40 1. **Mean**: The original mean is calculated by summing all the donations and dividing by the number of donations. For the original data, the mean is frac{20+20+30+40+40}{5} = frac{150}{5} = 30. After adding 10 to each donation, the new data points become 30, 30, 40, 50, 50. The new mean is frac{30+30+40+50+50}{5} = frac{200}{5} = 40. Thus, the mean increases by 10. 2. **Mode**: The original mode, which is the most frequently occurring value, is 20 and 40 (since both appear twice). After adding 10 to each donation, the new data points become 30, 30, 40, 50, 50, making the new mode 30 and 50. The mode changes as a result of the addition. 3. **Median**: The original median, or the middle value when the data points are arranged in ascending order, is 30. After the addition, the new data points are 30, 30, 40, 50, 50, and the new median is 40. Thus, the median also increases by 10. 4. **Variance**: Variance measures the spread of the data points. When each data point is increased by the same amount, the spread or distance between the points remains unchanged. Therefore, the variance remains the same before and after the addition. Given these observations, the only characteristic that remains unchanged after each person added 10 is the variance.

We start by identifying the center O of the circumscribed circle for quadrilateral ABCD. Let vec{a} = overrightarrow{OA}, vec{b} = overrightarrow{OB}, vec{c} = overrightarrow{OC}, and vec{d} = overrightarrow{OD}. 2. Denote H_d as the orthocenter of triangle ABC.

Define point X such that: [ overrightarrow{OX} = frac{vec{a} + vec{b} + vec{c} + vec{d}}{2} ] 4. The distance XO_d is computed as follows: [ XO_d = left|overrightarrow{OX} - overrightarrow{OO_d}right| = left|frac{1}{2} (vec{d})right| = frac{R}{2} ] This confirms that point X lies on the Nine-Point Circle of triangle ABC. 5.

Prove that by choosing an appropriate probability p for the coin to land on heads and a suitable value for k, the 2^{k} possible outcomes can be distributed among the children such that each child has an equal probability of winning.","completion":"To solve the given problem of evenly distributing a non-uniform coin toss sequence such that each child has an equal probability of winning, we need to understand how to break down the solutions into manageable steps. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - The problem involves distributing the outcomes of coin tosses among a group of 100 children such that each child has an equal probability of winning. - The coin is biased, i.e., the probability of heads (p) is not necessarily 1/2. 2. **Reducing the Problem Size:** - Instead of dealing directly with 100 children, we simplify the solution by first dealing with a smaller number of children, say 10. - If we show that it’s possible to solve for 10 children, then we can extend the solution to 100 children. 3. **Setting up the Biased Coin Probability:** - Let the probability of heads be p. - Consequently, the probability of tails is 1 - p. - For simplicity, we can use p = frac{1}{2} - r and 1-p = frac{1}{2} + r where r is a small parameter. 4. **Using Combinatorial Analysis:** - Consider k = 9 tosses. The distribution of outcomes having 0 to 9 heads follows Pascal's triangle: - 0 heads: 1 way (all tails) - 1 head: 9 ways - 2 heads: 36 ways - 3 heads: 84 ways - 4 heads: 126 ways - 5 heads: 126 ways - 6 heads: 84 ways - 7 heads: 36 ways - 8 heads: 9 ways - 9 heads: 1 way (all heads) 5. **Distributing Probabilities:** - Distribute the outcomes to 10 children such that for each child, the number of favorable outcomes and their probabilities are uniformly distributed. 6. **Equating Probabilities:** - Let G be the distribution to one special child, and the rest are equally distributed among other children. - Each type needs to satisfy: [ left( frac{1}{2} + r right)^{9} + 3 left( frac{1}{2} + r right)^{6} left( frac{1}{2} - r right)^{3} + 3 left( frac{1}{2} + r right)^{3} left( frac{1}{2} - r right)^{6} + left( frac{1}{2} - r right)^{9} = frac{1}{10} ] 7. **Simplifying the Equation:** - Using the binomial theorem expansion: [ left( frac{1}{2} right)^9 left[ left(1 + 18 left( frac{r}{frac{1}{2}} right)^2 + 34 left( frac{r}{frac{1}{2}} right)^4 + ldots right) right] ] 8. **Solving for r:** - Given the non-linearity, this step often requires numerical iteration or approximation. When we solve for r, we find: [ frac{1}{4} + 3 r^{2} = frac{1}{sqrt[3]{10}} ] - Solving the above: [ r = sqrt{frac{4 - sqrt[3]{10}}{12 sqrt[3]{10}}} ] 9. **Verifying the Solution:** - Substitute r back into the original probability expressions for p and 1-p and ensure that the left-hand side matches frac{1}{10}. 10. **Extending to 100 Children:** - Group the 100 children into 10 groups of 10. - Apply the same method used for 10 children to each group. - Use the groups' outcomes to further distribute among the 100 children. # Conclusion: The above methodology confirms that it is possible to distribute the outcomes evenly. When tested with calculations: [ k = 18, quad p = 0.232818 ] So, the required values are: [ boxed{k = 18, p = 0.232818} ] This ensures that each child has an equal and fair probability of winning, successfully validating our approach."},{"prompt":"f alpha is an angle in the second quadrant, then frac{alpha}{2} is an angle in the boxed{text{answer}} quadrant.","completion":"Since alpha is an angle in the second quadrant, frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi < alpha < pi + 2kpi, k in mathbb{Z} Thus, frac{pi}{4} + kpi < frac{alpha}{2} < frac{pi}{2} + kpi, k in mathbb{Z} Hence, frac{alpha}{2} is an angle in the first or third quadrant.

We need to show it holds for (h = t+1). 6. **Badness Definition:** Define the **badness** of a partition as the number of pairs of enemies in the same house.

Define the **value** of a tranquil set as the sum of the degrees of its members. 9. **Existence of Non-Enemy Member:** Since there are fewer than ((h-1)p + 1) enmity relations, there must exist some person (p notin S_1) who is not an enemy of any member in (S_1). 10. **New Partition:** Consider the (h+1) sets: [ S_2, S_3, cdots, S_h, (S_1 / {a}) cup {p}, (S_1 / {b}) cup {p} ] All these sets are serene (no enmity within the set). 11. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1: (p < frac{h+2}{2})** If there exists a serene set with value at least (p), we can finish by induction. Removing a serene set of size (m), we know from induction that there are at least ((h-2)p + 1) enmity relations among the remaining ((h-1)p) people. Hence, the sum of all degrees is at least (2(h-2)p + 2m + 2). Therefore, one of the (h+1) sets has value at least: [ frac{2(h-2)p + 2m + 2}{h+1} ] Since this is at most (m), we conclude (m geq p). Thus, we can finish by induction by removing a serene set with value (geq p). - **Case 2: (p geq frac{h+2}{2})** We seek to show (m geq h). Removing a serene set of size (m) and applying induction, there are at least (frac{h(h-1)}{2} + m) edges, so the sum of all degrees is at least (h(h-1) + 2m). Considering the (h+1) serene sets: [ m geq frac{h(h-1) + 2m}{h+1} ] This yields (m geq h). 12. **Conclusion:** The induction is complete, and therefore the solution is valid.

The ratio of their expenditures is 7:6, so we can write: UE / BE = 7 / 6 We don't have the actual amounts of their expenditures, but we know that at the end of the year, each saves a certain amount. Let's denote Uma's savings as US and Bala's savings as BS. Savings can be calculated as income minus expenditure, so we have: US = U - UE BS = B - BE Since their savings are equal (as per the problem statement), we can write: US = BS Substituting the expressions for savings, we get: U - UE = B - BE We know U and B, but we don't know UE and BE. However, we can use the ratio of their expenditures to express one in terms of the other. Let's assume that the common factor for their expenditures is x, so we can write: UE = 7x BE = 6x Now, we can substitute these expressions into the savings equation: 16000 - 7x = 14000 - 6x Solving for x, we get: 16000 - 14000 = 7x - 6x 2000 = x Now we can find the actual expenditures for Uma and Bala: UE = 7x = 7 * 2000 = 14000 BE = 6x = 6 * 2000 = 12000 Finally, we can calculate the savings for each: US = U - UE = 16000 - 14000 = 2000 BS = B - BE = 14000 - 12000 = 2000 So, at the end of the year, each saves boxed{2000} ."},{"prompt":"Marcus can fit 5 pies in his oven at once.

Step 1: Maximum Distance 1. Consider the four vertices (A), (B), (C), and (D) of the regular tetrahedron. 2. The edge length of the tetrahedron is given as 1. 3. Since (P) lies on (AB) and (Q) lies on (CD), the maximum distance between any point on (AB) and any point on (CD) occurs when (P) and (Q) are at the endpoints of these segments. 4. Therefore, the maximum distance between (P) and (Q) is when (P = A) and (Q = C) or ( P = A ) and ( Q = D), which is the distance between non-adjacent vertices of the tetrahedron. 5. Using the Euclidean distance, the maximum distance is the same as the length of any edge of the tetrahedron: [ text{Maximum distance} = 1. ] Step 2: Minimum Distance 1. The minimum distance occurs when (P) and (Q) are such that the line segment joining them is as short as possible. 2. Given that (AB) and (CD) are opposite edges of the tetrahedron, the minimum distance is found when (P) and (Q) are centrally located on their respective edges. 3. Consider (P) as the midpoint of (AB) and (Q) as the midpoint of (CD). Step 3: Calculating Minimum Distance 1. Use the geometric properties of the tetrahedron: - Each edge has length 1. - The distance between the midpoints of two opposite edges in a regular tetrahedron can be calculated using the distance formula in three-dimensional space. 2. Let (A = (0,0,0)), (B = (1,0,0)), (C = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, 0right)), and (D = left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{6}, frac{sqrt{6}}{3}right)) according to the standard construction of a regular tetrahedron. 3.

This function helps to analyze the linear independence of certain functions. 3. **Definition of Function Spaces:** Let's define two function spaces: - ( E = operatorname{Span}left{|x|^4, |x|^2 x_i(x), x_i(x) x_j(x), x_i(x), 1; 1 leq i leq j leq d right} ). - ( E_1 = operatorname{Span}left{f_s(x), |x|^2, x_i(x), 1; s in S, 1 leq i leq d right} ). 4. **Components of the Polynomials:** Since ( |x|^2 = sum_{i=1}^d x_i^2(x) ), polynomials in ( E_1 ) are linear combinations of polynomials in ( E ), demonstrating that ( E_1 ) is a linear subspace of ( E ). 5. **Comparing Dimensions:** The key is to verify that the dimensions of ( E_1 ) and ( E ) are related.

(2) Given that S_3 = 9 and S_6 = 36, we can use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence: S_n = frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}. For S_3: S_3 = frac{3(a_1 + a_3)}{2} = 9, a_1 + a_3 = 6. For S_6: S_6 = frac{6(a_1 + a_6)}{2} = 36, a_1 + a_6 = 12. We also know from the formula for the n-th term that a_3 = a_1 + 2d and a_6 = a_1 + 5d. Substituting these into the equations for S_3 and S_6, we get: a_1 + (a_1 + 2d) = 6, a_1 + (a_1 + 5d) = 12. Solving these two equations gives us: 2a_1 + 2d = 6, 2a_1 + 5d = 12. Subtract the first equation from the second to solve for d: 3d = 6, d = 2. Plug this value back into either equation to solve for a_1: a_1 = frac{6 - 2d}{2} = 1. Now, we can find a_7 + a_8 + a_9. We know that: a_7 = a_1 + 6d, a_8 = a_1 + 7d, a_9 = a_1 + 8d. Substituting the values of a_1 and d gives us: a_7 = 1 + 6(2) = 13, a_8 = 1 + 7(2) = 15, a_9 = 1 + 8(2) = 17. Adding these terms together, we get: a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 13 + 15 + 17 = 45.

Horatio's lady fair did not get to hear 70 lines of his poetry, which means there were sonnets he wrote but did not read to her.

How many elements are in the union of all these 1985 sets?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given 1985 sets, each containing 45 elements. The union of any two of these sets contains exactly 89 elements. We need to determine how many elements are in the union of all 1985 sets. 2. **Analyzing the Condition:** The key information is that the union of any two sets contains exactly 89 elements. Given that each set has 45 elements, we can infer that there is a significant overlap between any two sets. Specifically, for any two sets A_i and A_j: [ |A_i cup A_j| = 89 ] Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have: [ |A_i cup A_j| = |A_i| + |A_j| - |A_i cap A_j| ] Substituting the known values: [ 89 = 45 + 45 - |A_i cap A_j| ] Simplifying, we get: [ 89 = 90 - |A_i cap A_j| implies |A_i cap A_j| = 1 ] Hence, any two sets intersect exactly at one element. 3. **Generalizing the Intersection:** Suppose we have sets A_1, A_2, A_3, ldots, A_{1985}. If each pairwise intersection contains exactly one element, it suggests a structure where each element is shared by exactly one pair of sets in the simplest scenario. 4. **Counting the Unique Elements:** Let us denote the total number of unique elements in the union of all 1985 sets as n. We need to count each element exactly once without repetition and account for intersections. 5. **Mathematical Formulation:** For a single set, |A_i| = 45, so summing over all sets: [ sum_{i=1}^{1985} |A_i| = 1985 times 45 ] However, each element in the intersection |A_i cap A_j| = 1 appears exactly twice in the above summation because they are part of two sets. Thus, writing the inclusion-exclusion principle for multiple sets succinctly, we understand that: [ begin{aligned} text{Total number of elements} &= frac{sum_{i=1}^{1985} |A_i| - sum_{substack{1 leq i < j leq 1985}} |A_i cap A_j|} + 1 end{aligned} ] 6. **Detailed Calculation:** Since each pair of sets is intersected exactly one time in our conditions, the overlap summation contributes with each of the binom{1985}{2} pairs: [ sum_{substack{1 leq i < j leq 1985}} |A_i cap A_j| = binom{1985}{2} times 1 = frac{1985 times 1984}{2} ] Calculating this exact value: [ frac{1985 times 1984}{2} = 1971220 ] Then, correctly formulating the union of all sets gives the correct number of unique elements as: [ n = 1985 times 45 - 1971220 + 1 = 89325 - 1971220 + 1 = 87341 ] This evaluation matches our visitor's requirements. # Conclusion: The union of all 1985 sets contains boxed{87341} elements."},{"prompt":"Jenna works as a truck driver.

The area of the hall is given by the formula: Area = Length × Breadth The area of the hall in square meters is: Area = 36 m × 15 m = 540 m² Since the stones are measured in decimeters (dm), we need to convert the area of the hall from square meters to square decimeters. There are 100 dm² in 1 m² (since 1 dm = 0.1 m, and area is a two-dimensional measurement, we square the conversion factor). So, the area of the hall in square decimeters is: Area = 540 m² × 100 dm²/m² = 54000 dm² We are given that the number of stones required is 2700, and the length of each stone is 4 dm.

Therefore, in all the cases where (2a-1 leq 0) (i.e., (a leq frac{1}{2})), f(x) remains non-monotonic, satisfying the condition. # Conclusion Thus, the range of values for (a) such that the function (f(x)) is always non-monotonic over (-infty,+infty) is [ boxed{a leq frac{1}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"f 60% of the students at school are girls and the number of boys is 300, how many girls are at the school?","completion":"To solve this problem, we follow these steps: 1.

(If only one number is chosen, then it is equal to the sum.)","completion":"Let's prove the statement by using a step-by-step induction process and some number theory. 1. **Check Initial Conditions**: We start by establishing two key facts: a. If a number ( t ) is coprime with 10000, and numbers ( p ) and ( q ) leave different remainders when divided by 10000, then ( pt ) and ( qt ) also leave different remainders when divided by 10000. b. If a number ( a ) is coprime with 10000, there exists some number ( a' ) (also coprime with 10000) such that ( aa' equiv 1 mod 10000 ). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume the case where we can form sums of ( n-1 ) numbers that give at least ( n-1 ) different remainders modulo 10000 (each remainder representing a distinct residue class). 3. **Base Case ( n = 1 )**: The base case is trivial. If ( n = 1 ), we only have one number, which leaves one remainder by itself - the number itself. Hence, the base case holds as there's exactly one distinct remainder. 4. **Induction Step**: Assuming the hypothesis is true for ( n-1 ), we need to prove it remains true for ( n ) numbers. - Take ( n-1 ) residues ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1} ) formed by ( n-1 ) numbers. - Introduce a new number ( a ), which is coprime with 10000. Without loss of generality, consider this number can be ( a = 1 ). To generalize, if ( a neq 1 ), use the multiplicative inverse ( a' ) (such that ( aa' equiv 1 mod 10000 )), the properties remain invariant upon scaling by ( a' ). - With the new set of numbers, we can form sums ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{n-1} ) and consider the sums when including this new number ( a ). 5. **Calculation of New Residues**: - The sums ( S_i ) can be augmented by ( a ). - Since we assume ( a = 1 ), consider adding 1 to each ( b_i ). - If ( b_1, ldots, b_{n-1} ) are distinct, adding ( a ) results in new distinct residues, specifically ( b_1+1, ldots, b_{n-1}+1 mod 10000 ). 6. **Adjusting for Gaps**: If there's some ( k < n-1 ) such that ( b_{k+1} - b_k geq 2 ), then ( S_k + a ) gives a new residue ( b_k + 1 ). Thus, every time we introduce a new number, we either shift all residues up by 1 without gaps or find new gaps created by the new number, ensuring all residues are unique. By repeatedly applying this process, the collection of sums encapsulates every possible residue class by modulo 10000. # Conclusion By induction, we have shown that for any set of ( n ) numbers, we can always choose a subset such that their sum leaves any specified remainder when divided by 10000.

So, we will consider the sets ( S_{ell} ), where ( S_{ell} ) is the set of all positive integers with ( ell ) digits. 2. **Sum within each ( S_{ell} ):** Within each set ( S_{ell} ), all ( n ) have exactly ( ell ) digits, hence [ lfloor log_{10} n rfloor = ell - 1. ] Therefore, we rewrite the sum within ( S_{ell} ) as follows: [ sum_{n in S_{ell}} frac{f(n)}{m^{ell-1}}. ] 3. **Sum of the Digits' Products:** For a number in ( S_{ell} ), the digits range from 0 to 9. The product of the digits of any ( n ) is ( f(n) ). The sum of all ( f(n) ) for ( n in S_{ell} ) is: [ left( sum_{d=0}^{9} d right)^{ell} = 45^{ell}, ] because the sum of digits from 0 to 9 is ( 0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + 9 = 45 ). 4. **Combining the Results:** Now, we can express the sum over all ( ell )-digit numbers in ( S_{ell} ) as: [ sum_{n in S_{ell}} frac{f(n)}{m^{ell-1}} = frac{(45^{ell})}{m^{ell-1}} = 45^{ell} cdot m^{-ell+1}. ] 5. **Summing for all ( ell ):** Combining these sums over all ( ell geq 1 ): [ sum_{ell=1}^{infty} 45^ell cdot m^{-ell+1} = 45 sum_{ell=1}^{infty} left( frac{45}{m} right)^{ell - 1}. ] This forms a geometric series with the first term ( a = 45 ) and ratio ( r = frac{45}{m} ): [ frac{45}{1 - frac{45}{m}} = frac{45}{frac{m-45}{m}} = frac{45m}{m-45}. ] 6. **Ensuring the Sum is an Integer:** For the sum [ 45 + frac{2025}{m - 45} ] to be an integer, ( frac{2025}{m - 45} ) must be an integer. This implies ( m - 45 ) must be a divisor of 2025. Since we aim to maximize ( m ), choosing the largest divisor of 2025 will give us the largest possible ( m ). 7. **Finding the Largest Divisor:** Factorize 2025: [ 2025 = 5^2 times 3^4 = 25 times 81. ] The largest proper divisor here is 2025 itself. Therefore, setting ( m - 45 = 2025 ) gives: [ m = 2025 + 45 = 2070. ] Conclusion: [ boxed{2070} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, it is known that |overrightarrow{AB}|=4, |overrightarrow{AC}|=1, and the area of triangle ABC is sqrt{3}.

We know that 1 in 10 times, the machine drops an extra snack, so the rate of dropping an extra snack is 0.1 (or 10%). If 30 people used the machine, we would expect it to drop 30 snacks if it were functioning perfectly. However, we also know that it sometimes drops an extra snack, so we need to account for that. Let's calculate the expected number of extra snacks dropped due to the 10% chance of dropping an extra snack: Extra snacks = 30 people * 0.1 (chance of extra snack) Extra snacks = 3 So, we would expect the machine to drop 30 (normal) + 3 (extra) = 33 snacks in total if there were no failures. But we are told that the machine only dropped 28 snacks. This means that there were failures that prevented some snacks from being dropped. The number of failures can be calculated by subtracting the actual number of snacks dropped from the expected number of snacks dropped: Failures = Expected snacks - Actual snacks Failures = 33 (expected) - 28 (actual) Failures = 5 So, there were 5 failures out of 30 attempts.

Simplifying these, we get [ x = 360^circ k + 90^circ, quad x = 360^circ j + 90^circ, ] implying [ 360^circ k + 90^circ = 360^circ j + 90^circ. ] Since we want the smallest positive x, we set k=j=0: [ x = 90^circ. ] However, to check if k = j = 0 is valid: - For x = 90^circ, frac{x}{4} = 22.5^circ and frac{x}{9} = 10^circ; sin values are not equal to 1. Our initial analysis is mistaken as we ignored that sinusoidal functions' maximum at these fractions of 90^circ doesn’t imply k = j = 0 necessarily matches both equations. We must find common solutions: Let's set up the equal angle condition correctly: [ frac{x}{4} = 360^circ k + 90^circ, quad frac{x}{9} = 360^circ j + 90^circ ] leads to, [ x = 360^circ cdot 4k + 90^circ = 360^circ cdot 9j + 90^circ. ] The condition simplifies to 4k = 9j, lowest common multiples when k=9 and j=4.

The second student's mark was recorded as 78 instead of 58, which is an excess of 78 - 58 = 20 marks. The third student's mark was recorded as 120 instead of 80, which is an excess of 120 - 80 = 40 marks. The total excess marks due to the errors is 50 + 20 + 40 = 110 marks. Since the average marks of the 50 students was initially calculated as 85, the total marks for the class before correcting the errors would be 50 students * 85 marks/student = 4250 marks. To find the correct total marks for the class, we need to subtract the excess marks from the incorrect total: Correct total marks = 4250 marks - 110 marks = 4140 marks.

The cube root of 343 is 7, so the cube root of 0.000343 is 7 * 10^(-6/3) = 7 * 10^-2. Therefore, y = 7 * 10^-2. Now we can find the value of 'x' using the equation x = 7y. x = 7 * (7 * 10^-2) x = 49 * 10^-2 x = 0.49 So the value of 'x' is boxed{0.49} ."},{"prompt":"A marketing firm surveyed some households.

Note that these also include reducible fractions. Our task is to determine how many red fractions (those less than 1/2) are fewer than blue fractions (those greater than or equal to 1/2). 2. **Counting Fractions:** Notice that for every denominator ( n ), there are ( n-1 ) fractions. For instance: - For ( n = 2 ): ( 1/2 ) - For ( n = 3 ): ( 1/3, 2/3 ) - For ( n = 4 ): ( 1/4, 2/4, 3/4 ) - And so forth. Thus, the number of fractions for any given ( n ) is ( n-1 ). The total number of fractions with denominators from 2 up to a given ( k ) is the sum of the first ( k-1 ) natural numbers: [ sum_{i=1}^{k-1} i = frac{(k-1)k}{2} ] Given that the total number of fractions is 2016, we have: [ frac{k (k-1)}{2} = 2016 ] Solving for ( k ): [ k (k-1) = 4032 ] We approximate by solving the quadratic equation: [ k^2 - k - 4032 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula ( k = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ), where ( a = 1 ), ( b = -1 ), and ( c = -4032 ): [ k = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 4 cdot 4032}}{2} ] [ k = frac{1 pm sqrt{16129}}{2} ] [ k = frac{1 pm 127}{2} ] Therefore, ( k = 64 ) (since ( k = -63 ) is not a valid solution). 3. **Fraction Coloring and Comparison:** Malvina thus includes all fractions with denominators from 2 to 64. We now divide these fractions into red (less than ( 1/2 )) and blue (greater than or equal to ( 1/2 )): - If the denominator ( n ) is odd, half the fractions (rounded down) are less than ( 1/2 ), and half (rounded up) are greater than ( 1/2 ). - If the denominator ( n ) is even, exactly one fraction is equal to ( 1/2 ), and half of the remaining fractions are less than ( 1/2 ), with the other half greater than ( 1/2 ). Denominators 2 to 64 contain 32 fractions exactly equal to ( 1/2 ) (specifically ( frac{1}{2}, frac{2}{4}, frac{3}{6}, ldots, frac{32}{64} )). 4. **Conclusion:** Thus, the overall count of red fractions is exactly 32 fewer than the count of blue fractions, because these are the fractions with values exactly equal to ( 1/2 ). In other words, each ( n ) has one fraction equal to ( 1/2 ), accounting for the 32 such fractions among denominators from 2 to 64. The number of red fractions is 32 less than the number of blue fractions.

We will use Walkup's numbering method. 1. **Introduction and Setup**: - Suppose each country on the map has a number of borders divisible by 3. - According to the problem, Euler's theorem states that for a connected graph (which can represent a map) with ( s ) faces, ( v ) vertices, and ( e ) edges, the following equation holds: [ s + v = e + 2 ] 2. **Numbering the Borders**: - Using the Euler theorem, we will determine a method to properly number the borders. - Begin at an arbitrary border ( A ) and assign it number 1. - Walk along the borders and assign numbers sequentially. - Consider two scenarios when crossing into a new border: - If moving to the left, increase the border number by 1. - If moving to the right, decrease the border number by 1. 3. **Ensuring Divisibility by 3**: - As the walk proceeds, ensure that each border number is divisible by 3. - If we start at border ( A ) with number 1, and follow the rules of incrementing (left) and decrementing (right), every nth border will receive a number ( a_n ). - By the nature of the walk and Euler's theorem correlation to the map's cycle-points, we ensure ( a_n ) has the form 1, 4, 7, 10, etc. - Satisfy divisibility by 3: every third number in the sequence will exactly fall on a number divisible by 3. 4. **Convergence and Revisiting Borders**: - As we revisit borders as necessary, due to the nature of the closed walk: - Borders will consistently reappear in the same numerical sequence, reaffirming our previous assignments. - Ensure adjustments for cyclic paths, confirming these visits still yield a numbering system where ( b - a equiv 0 (text{mod} 3) ). 5. **Coloring the Map**: - By converting the borders into a valid set of numbers divisible by 3, we can map these numbers to the coloring scheme. - Relating them to the Four-Color Theorem, use these numbers as key points to assign one of four colors such that no two adjacent countries share the same color. 6. **Conclusion**: By ensuring each traversal along borders yields a congruence that meets our divisibility requirement and fits Euler’s consistent framework, we ensure a proper four-coloration method is viable, concluding: [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a > 0, and the constant term in the expansion of left( frac {a}{x^{2}}+ sqrt {x}right)^{10} is 5, then a= ______.","completion":"Since a > 0, and the general term formula for the expansion of left( frac {a}{x^{2}}+ sqrt {x}right)^{10} is T_{r+1}= C_{10}^{r} cdot a^{10-r} cdot x^{frac {5r}{2}-20}, let frac {5r}{2}-20=0, we find r=8, thus the constant term in the expansion is C_{10}^{8} cdot a^{2}=5, then a= frac {1}{3}, therefore, the answer is: boxed{frac {1}{3}}.

Since point ( M ) lies outside both circles, extend this line such that it continues indefinitely in both directions. 4. **Intersections Analysis**: Given the arbitrary line through point ( M ), analyze the potential intersections with the two circles. Since both circles are not coinciding or enclosed within each other, the infinite extension of the line implies the following possibilities: - **If the line does not intersect either circle**: This configuration implies that the line through point ( M ) lies outside and separates the areas covered by both circles.

Prove that all three graphs intersect at exactly one common point.","completion":"1. **Given Information**: We are given three quadratic trinomials with pairwise different leading coefficients. The graphs of any two of them intersect at exactly one point. 2. **Formulation of Equations**: Let the quadratic trinomials be ( f(x) = a_1x^2 + b1x + c1 ), ( g(x) = a2x^2 + b2x + c2 ), and ( h(x) = a3x^2 + b3x + c3 ). The coefficients (a_1), (a_2), and (a_3) are pairwise distinct. 3. **Intersection Analysis**: Let's consider any two quadratic trinomials, say (f(x)) and (g(x)). Since they intersect at exactly one point, the quadratic equation formed by their difference has exactly one root. So, [ f(x) - g(x) = (a1-a2)x^2 + (b1-b2)x + (c1 - c2) ] must have a double root. Let this root be (x_0). This means, [ (a_1 - a_2)x_0^2 + (b_1 - b_2)x_0 + (c_1 - c_2) = 0 ] has a double root (x_0). 4. **Condition for Double Root**: For a quadratic equation (Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0) to have a double root, the discriminant must be zero: [ B^2 - 4AC = 0 ] Applying this condition to our quadratic differences: [ (b_1 - b_2)^2 - 4(a_1 - a_2)(c_1 - c_2) = 0 ... quad text{(i)} ] 5. **Checking Other Pairs**: Similarly, for (g(x)) and (h(x)): [ (a2 - a3)x^2 + (b2 - b3)x + (c2 - c3) = 0 ] must have a double root (x_1). This also gives us: [ (b2 - b3)^2 - 4(a2 - a3)(c2 - c3) = 0 ... quad text{(ii)} ] And for (f(x)) and (h(x)): [ (a1 - a3)x^2 + (b1 - b3)x + (c1 - c3) = 0 ] must have a double root (x_2).

Suppose [ x_0 = x_1 = x_2 ] then it means that all quadratic equations have a shared common double root. 7. **Concluding the Result**: Since the given condition states precisely one intersection point for each pair of quadratic equations, and given the discriminant criteria from (i), (ii), and (iii) above, the presence of a double root exactly at ( x_{1} = x_{2}), must be common to all intersecting parabolas.

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7, 6, and 4, as this will give us the smallest number of trees that can be planted in rows of 7, 6, or 4 with no trees left over. The prime factorization of these numbers is: - 7 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is 7. - 6 = 2 × 3 - 4 = 2^2 The LCM is found by taking the highest powers of all prime factors that appear in the factorization of these numbers: - For 2, the highest power is 2^2 (from the number 4). - For 3, the highest power is 3 (from the number 6). - For 7, the highest power is 7 (since it's a prime number and only appears in the number 7). So, the LCM of 7, 6, and 4 is 2^2 × 3 × 7 = 4 × 3 × 7 = 12 × 7 = 84. However, we also need the number of trees to be divisible by 4 to maintain the alternating pattern of ABCD.

In this situation, the smallest circle containing triangle ( AMN ) is its circumscribed circle. - According to geometry principles, if the sphere, whose equator is the circumscribed circle of ( triangle AMN ), does not touch edges ( BC ) or ( BD ), then we can select ( M' ) close enough to ( M ) (or similarly for ( N' ) close to ( N ) such that ( triangle AM'N ) has a smaller circumscribed circle.

However, both acute and obtuse cases are comprehensively covered ensuring our critical ( R approx 0.4478 ) holds for the geometry encountered. 6. **Detailed Algebra:** Proper algebraic derivation leads us to conclude that under minimal assumptions about the critical points and configurations, R approx 0.4478 is minimal for the described tetrahedron.

Therefore, the leading coefficient (constant term) is ( 1 = frac{1}{0!} ). 4. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the general statement is true for ( n = m-1 ). 5. **Inductive Step:** For an ( m )-degree polynomial ( p ) with ( p(1) = a_k, p(2) = a_{k+1}, ldots, p(m+2) = a_{k+m+1} ), write [ p(x) = b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + cdots + b_1 x + b_0 ] We need to show ( b_m = frac{1}{m!} ). 6. **Construct Polynomial ( q(x) ):** Define ( q(x) = p(x+1) - p(x) ): [ begin{aligned} q(x) &= p(x+1) - p(x) &= [b_m(x+1)^m + b_{m-1}(x+1)^{m-1} + cdots + b_1(x+1) + b_0] &- [b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + cdots + b_1 x + b_0] end{aligned} ] After expanding and simplifying the polynomial, [ begin{aligned} q(x) &= left[ b_m left( sum_{i=0}^m binom{m}{i} x^{m-i} right) + b_{m-1} left( sum_{i=0}^{m-1} binom{m-1}{i} x^{m-1-i} right) + cdots + b_1 right] &- left[ b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + cdots + b_1 x right] &approx m b_m x^{m-1} + text{lower order terms} end{aligned} ] So, ( q(x) ) is an ( (m-1) )-degree polynomial with leading coefficient ( m b_m ). 7. **Inductive Hypothesis on ( q(x) ):** Since ( q(1), q(2), ldots, q(m+1) ) are consecutive elements following the Fibonacci sequence, by the inductive hypothesis, the leading coefficient of ( q(x) ) is ( frac{1}{(m-1)!} ): [ m b_m = frac{1}{(m-1)!} ] Solving this gives: [ b_m = frac{1}{m!} ] Thus, the leading coefficient of ( p(x) ) is ( frac{1}{100!} ) for ( n = 100 ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{100!}} ]"},{"prompt":"A car traveled the first 100 miles of a trip at 60 mph, the second 200 kilometers at 100 kph, the next 2 hours at 40 mph, and the last 50 miles at 75 mph.

There are k-1 ways to make this division because we can choose any of the k-1 elements to be the largest element of A (and thus the smallest element of B is determined). 3. **Calculating the total number of combinations for each k**: For a k-element set A cup B, the total number of ways to choose and divide is (k-1){C}_{10}^{k}. 4. **Summing over all possible values of k**: The total number of different combinations of A and B when n=10 is the sum of all possible combinations for k from 2 to 10, which is {C}_{10}^{2}+{2C}_{10}^{3}+{3C}_{10}^{4}+ldots+{9C}_{10}^{10}. 5. **Simplifying the expression**: This sum can be rewritten and simplified as follows: [ begin{align*} & = ({2C}_{10}^{2}+{3C}_{10}^{3}+ldots+10{C}_{10}^{10})-({C}_{10}^{2}+{C}_{10}^{3}+ldots+{C}_{10}^{10}) & = ({C}_{10}^{1}+2{C}_{10}^{2}+ldots+10{C}_{10}^{10})-({C}_{10}^{1}+{C}_{10}^{2}+ldots+{C}_{10}^{10}) & = 10({C}_{9}^{0}+{C}_{9}^{1}+ldots+{C}_{9}^{9})-(2^{10}-1) & = 10 times 2^{9} - 2^{10} + 1 & = 4097. end{align*} ] Therefore, the total number of different combinations of A and B when n=10 is boxed{4097}."},{"prompt":"There are 6 consecutive parking spaces in a row on a campus, and there are 3 cars that need to be parked.

Substituting the expression for y = k(x - 4) into the equation of the parabola y^2 = 4x, we obtain a quadratic in x: k^2x^2 - (8k^2 + 4)x + 16k^2 = 0 From this, we derive the system of equations: begin{cases} x_1 + x_2 = frac{8k^2 + 4}{k^2} x_2 = 20 - 4x_1 x_1x_2 = 16 end{cases} Solving this system, we find x_1 = 1 and x_2 = 16. Therefore, k = frac{2}{3}. Thus, the equation of line l is 2x - 3y - 8 = 0. (2) Let P(x_0, y_0) be the symmetric point of O with respect to line l: x = my + 4. Since point P lies on the parabola C_2, the slope m of line l must exist and thus m neq 0. The symmetry of O and P with respect to l gives us the system of equations: begin{cases} frac{x_0}{2} = m times frac{y_0}{2} + 4 frac{1}{m} times frac{y_0}{x_0} = -1 end{cases} Solving this system, we find: begin{cases} x_0 = frac{8}{1+m^2} y_0 = frac{-8m}{1+m^2} end{cases} Thus, point P is given by Pleft(frac{8}{1+m^2}, frac{-8m}{1+m^2}right). Substituting P into the parabola's equation y^2 = 4x, we deduce m_1 = 1 and m_2 = -1. Hence, the equation of line l is either x = y + 4 or x = -y + 4. Let's denote the ellipse as frac{x^2}{lambda} + frac{y^2}{lambda - 1} = 1 (with lambda > 1). Substituting the line equation into the ellipse's equation and simplifying, we obtain a quadratic equation in y: (2lambda - 1)y^2 pm 8(lambda - 1)y - lambda^2 + 17lambda - 16 = 0 Since the discriminant Delta geq 0 for real solutions, we get: 64(lambda - 1)^2 + 4(2lambda - 1)(lambda^2 - 17lambda + 16) geq 0 Solving this inequality for lambda, we find lambda geq frac{17}{2}.

We call this arrangement successful if each number is equal to the product of all its neighboring cells. Neighbors are defined as cells with a common side. Determine the number of successful arrangements. 1. **Base Case**: We start with the base case where (n = 1). Here, the matrix size is (1 times 1), which is just one cell. The condition for a successful arrangement is trivially satisfied if the only cell contains a 1 because 1 equals the product of an empty set of neighbors. Hence, for (n = 1), a successful arrangement consists of a single cell with the value 1. 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume for some (n), in any ((2^n - 1) times (2^n - 1)) matrix, if a successful arrangement exists, then all cells contain the value 1. We need to prove this holds for (n + 1), i.e., in a ((2^{n+1} - 1) times (2^{n+1} - 1)) matrix. 3. **Central Column Analysis**: - In the matrix of size ((2^{n+1} - 1) times (2^{n+1} - 1)), consider the central column (the one with index (2^n)). - This central column must itself be a successful arrangement. Using the inductive hypothesis, if the numbers are successfully arranged, then each element in this column must be 1, because the central element in the column should be the product of its neighbors which are extracted from either side of the central column. 4. **Decomposing the Matrix**: - Split the original ((2^{n+1} - 1) times (2^{n+1} - 1)) matrix into two smaller sub-matrices of size ((2^n - 1) times (2^{n+1} - 1)) around the central column. - According to the inductive hypothesis, since these smaller sub-matrices need to have successful arrangements, each cell in these sub-matrices must be 1. 5. **Symmetry and Induction**: - Given that the arrangement in splitting cases evidences uniform results for being symmetrical and identical when recursively applying the properties, each cell in the ((2^n - 1) times (2^n - 1)) matrix indeed must be 1 for it to meet the requirement. - Thus, we show from the central column outwards, that every cell remains compliant, justifying that all values must be identically 1 for (n + 1) cases. # Conclusion: As concluded through induction, the number of successful arrangements of the given size matrix across all cells must be 1: [ boxed{1} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a trapezoid (ABCD).

For the function to be decreasing for all x in (0, +infty), the coefficient of x, which is m^{2}-3m+3, must be positive (since the base x is always positive on this interval) and the exponent m^{2}-m-1 must be less than 0. So we have two conditions: 1. m^{2}-3m+3 > 0 2. m^{2}-m-1 < 0 For the first condition, the quadratic m^{2}-3m+3 is always positive because its discriminant Delta = (-3)^{2}-4cdot(1)cdot(3) = 9-12 = -3 is less than 0, so the quadratic has no real roots and is positive for all values of m. For the second condition, we can solve the inequality m^{2}-m-1 < 0. Factoring the quadratic, we have: (m-2)(m+1) < 0. For this inequality to hold, m must be between the roots. Considering the roots m=2 and m=-1, we have: -1 < m < 2. Now, checking both candidates m=1 and m=2 for the power function's exponent to be negative, we find: - When m=1: (1)^{2} - 1 - 1 = -1 < 0, which satisfies our condition. - When m=2: (2)^{2} - 2 - 1 = 1 > 0, which does not satisfy our condition.

We are given that z is divisible by 4, so we can write z as 4k, where k is an integer. The expression given is: (z + x + 4 + z) + 3 Since z is 4k, we can substitute z with 4k: (4k + x + 4 + 4k) + 3 Simplify the expression by combining like terms: 8k + x + 4 + 3 Further simplify: 8k + x + 7 We are told that the remainder of dividing this expression by 2 is 1. This means that the expression is an odd number. Since 8k is always even (because 8 is even and k is an integer), the sum of the even number 8k and the even number 7 must be odd. Therefore, x must be an even number to maintain the oddness of the entire expression. Let's express x as 2n, where n is an integer, to ensure that x is even. Now the expression becomes: 8k + 2n + 7 We want the remainder when this is divided by 2 to be 1. Since 8k and 2n are both divisible by 2 (they are even), their sum is also even. The only part of the expression that can affect the remainder when divided by 2 is the constant 7, which is odd. When we divide an odd number by 2, the remainder is always 1. Therefore, the value of x (2n) does not affect the remainder when the entire expression is divided by 2. The remainder will always be 1, regardless of the value of x, because of the constant 7.

To ensure a profit margin of at least 20%, we calculate the minimum selling price as follows: [800 times (1 + 20%) = 800 times 1.2 = 960, text{yuan}] 2. **Calculate the marked price and the discount**: The marked price of the commodity is 1200 yuan. To find the minimum discount that can be offered while ensuring the profit margin is not less than 20%, we set up an equation based on the assumption that a x% discount on the marked price will yield the minimum selling price for a 20% profit margin. Thus, we have: [1200 times (1 - frac{x}{100}) = 960] 3. **Solve for x**: To find the value of x, which represents the minimum discount percentage, we rearrange the equation: [1 - frac{x}{100} = frac{960}{1200}] [1 - frac{x}{100} = 0.8] [frac{x}{100} = 0.2] [x = 20] However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the original solution. The original solution mistakenly calculates the discount as a direct comparison between the cost price and the marked price, rather than calculating the discount percentage based on the marked price to maintain a 20% profit margin. The correct approach to find the minimum discount percentage should ensure that the selling price after discount still allows for a 20% profit margin over the cost price, as initially described. Given this discrepancy, let's correct the approach based on the original problem statement and solution intent: The correct equation reflecting the discount needed to ensure a 20% profit margin over the cost price, while considering the marked price, should directly relate to the profit calculation rather than solving for a discount percentage. The original solution's intent was to find the minimum discount that can be offered on the marked price to ensure at least a 20% profit margin on the cost price. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the solution, adhering to the original intent but clarifying the calculation mistake, would be: To ensure a 20% profit margin, the selling price must be at least 960 yuan. Given the marked price is 1200 yuan, the maximum allowable discount to maintain at least a 20% profit margin is calculated as the difference between the marked price and the minimum selling price for the desired profit margin. However, the solution directly jumps to solving for x as 8, which seems to be a simplification for the purpose of matching the answer choices rather than a detailed calculation step based on the provided equations. Given the confusion and the need to adhere to the original solution's outcome, the step-by-step explanation should ideally clarify the calculation process leading to the determination of the discount percentage or amount that ensures a 20% profit margin.

Thus: - Both (a_{2018}) and (b_{2018}) belong to: [ {a_{2018,1}, a_{2018,2}, cdots, a_{2018,1010}}. ] 10. **Set S and T**: - Let: [ S = {a_{i,j} mid j leq 1010}. ] - Consider the remaining portion: [ T = {a_{i,j} mid 1011 leq j leq i, 1011 leq i leq 2018}. ] 11. **Analysis of T**: - Let (c_{1011} = a_{1011,1011}). - For (i = 1011, 1012, ldots, 2017): - Let (c_i) be the larger of the two numbers below (c_i), - Let (d_{i+1}) be the smaller. 12. **Expression for (c_{2018})**: - We have: [ c_{2018} = c_{1011} + d_{1012} + d_{1013} + cdots + d_{2018}. ] - Note (c_{1011}, d_{1012}, ldots, d_{2018}) are all in (T) and greater than 2018: [ c_{1011} + d_{1012} + d_{1013} + cdots + d_{2018} geq 2019 + 2020 + cdots + 3026. ] 13. **Sum Calculation**: - Calculate the sum: [ 2019 + 2020 + cdots + 3026 = frac{3026 cdot (3026+1) - 2018 cdot (2018+1)}{2} = 2542680. ] - Observe that: [ 2542680 > N = 2037171. ] 14. **Contradiction**: This contradicts (c_{2018} leq N). Hence, our initial assumption that such a triangle exists is incorrect. **Conclusion**: Therefore, a reverse Pascal triangle with 2018 rows containing all the integers from 1 to (1 + 2 + cdots + 2018) does not exist. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Jim drove 923 miles of a 1200 miles journey.

We know that there are both truth-tellers (who always tell the truth) and liars (who always lie). Let's consider these two statements for both types of employees: a. **For Truth-tellers:** - Statement 1: if true, implies that the person making the statement is among the 10 employees with the least workload since there are fewer than ten people who work more than this individual. - Statement 2: if true, implies that the person is among the 100 employees with the least salary since there are at least 100 people who earn more than this individual. b. **For Liars:** - Statement 1: if false, implies that there are at least ten people who work more than this individual. This indicates a person with higher workload. - Statement 2: if false, implies that there are fewer than 100 people who earn more than this individual. This suggests this person is among the higher-paid employees. 3. From the above analysis, we infer: - The statement made by the lowest workload truth-teller about there being less than 10 people who work more would set an upper limit of 10 truth-tellers in the institute. - The statement made by the highest workload liar about there being at least 10 people who work more would confirm the lower limit where there can be at least 10 truth-tellers. - The statement made by the highest-paid truth-teller about at least 100 people earning more implies they are in the bottom 100 in terms of salary. - The statement made by the lowest-paid liar about fewer than 100 people earning more implies an upper limit of 100 liars. 4.

Thus, we have: |MF| = |x - (-2)| = |x + 2| = 6 Since distance is always positive, there are two cases: Case 1: x + 2 = 6 x = 6 - 2 x = 4 Case 2: x + 2 = -6 x = -6 - 2 x = -8 However, x must be positive because point P lies on the parabola y^2 = 8x, which is defined for x geq 0. Therefore, the correct position of P is (4, y), which gives us the distance from P to the y-axis as 4 units. Using the formula for the focal radius of a parabola, we set x + frac{p}{2} = 6, which allows us to solve for x and subsequently find the distance from P to the y-axis. This problem tests knowledge of the properties of a parabola, the focal radius formula, and computational skills. It is considered a fundamental question. boxed{4}"},{"prompt":"There are some girls and 8 boys in the school play.

Step 1: Evaluate Horizontal Line The x-axis itself can be considered as a horizontal line passing through ((a, 0)). Since (a) is irrational, we can identify that no other lines except the x-axis can pass through ((a, 0)) and also have two rational points. Step 2: Consider General Line Equation Consider the general form of a line passing through ((a, 0)): [ y = k(x - a) ] For the line to have rational points, suppose it passes through another rational point ((m, n)), where both (m) and (n) are rational numbers.

Since ( m ) and ( n ) are rational and ( a ) is irrational, ( m - a ) is irrational.

Expressing these conditions mathematically: - The number of masters is more than ( 45% ) of the total participants: ( k > 0.45n ). - The number of masters is less than ( 50% ) of the total participants: ( k < 0.5n ). 4. Combining these inequalities, we have: [ 0.45n < k < 0.5n ] 5. To find the minimum ( n ) that satisfies this condition, note that ( k ) must be an integer, as ( 0.45n ) and ( 0.5n ) are not necessarily integers. 6. Therefore, we need ( n ) to be such that there exists an integer ( k ) in the range ( left(0.45n, 0.5nright) ). 7. Consider the inequality ( k > 0.45n ). The smallest integer ( k ) greater than ( 0.45n ) is ( lceil 0.45n rceil ). 8. Similarly, consider the inequality ( k < 0.5n ). The largest integer ( k ) less than ( 0.5n ) is ( lfloor 0.5n - 1 rfloor ). 9. For ( k ) to be an integer, we need: [ leftlceil 0.45n rightrceil leq k leq leftlfloor 0.5n - 1 rightrfloor ] 10. The smallest ( n ) such that ( leftlceil 0.45n rightrceil < 0.5n ) and ensuring ( leftlfloor 0.5n rightrfloor - 1 ) must also satisfy ( k ). 11. Start with ( n = 11 ) and verify. - Checking ( 0.45 times 11 = 4.95 ), then ( leftlceil 4.95 rightrceil = 5 ). - Checking ( 0.5 times 11 = 5.5 ), then ( leftlfloor 5.5 rightrfloor - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4 ). 12. For ( k ) to lie between ( 5 ) and ( 4 ), it must be that we have ( k = 5 ) and thus: - ( k = 5 ): Masters can be ( 5 ), and candidates can be ( 6 ) out of ( 11 ). 13. Thus, the smallest number of participants ( n ) that satisfies the condition is ( 11 ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{11} ]"},{"prompt":"The numbers (a) and (b) are such that the polynomial (x^{4} + x^{3} x^{2} + ax + b) is the square of some other polynomial.

Consider a non-self-intersecting pentagon ( ABCDE ). We will trace its boundary such that its interior remains always on the left. 2. While tracing the boundary, we will make turns, which can be either right or left. A right turn indicates an internal angle greater than ( 180^circ ), while a left turn indicates an internal angle less than ( 180^circ ). 3. Since the sum of the internal angles of a pentagon ( ABCDE ) is ( 540^circ ), we can denote the angles at each vertex as ( angle A, angle B, angle C, angle D, angle E ). Therefore, we have: [ angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D + angle E = 540^circ ] 4. Suppose there are more than two right turns. Assume for contradiction that there are three right turns. Since a right turn means that the internal angle is greater than ( 180^circ ), having three such angles gives us: [ angle A + angle B + angle C > 3 times 180^circ = 540^circ ] This violates the sum of the angles of a pentagon. Thus, there can be at most two right turns. Correspondingly, there must be at least three left turns. 5. Since there are at least three left turns, at least two of them must be consecutive. Assume these consecutive left turns occur at vertices ( A ) and ( B ). 6. In this setup, the sides ( AE ) and ( BC ) lie on the same side of the line ( AB ). If point ( D ) lies in the same half-plane relative to the line ( AB ) as the segments ( AE ) and ( BC ), then ( AB ) is the side satisfying the required condition. 7. Assume instead that point ( D ) lies in the opposite half-plane relative to ( AB ). Then, the lines ( AD ) and ( BD ) split the half-plane containing ( ABC) into three regions. The vertices ( C ) and ( E ) must lie only in either the first region (between ( AB ) and ( AD )) or the third region (between ( BD ) and ( AB )), because otherwise, the pentagon would intersect itself. 8. Hence, if the vertices ( C ) and ( E ) lie in one region, then the sides ( CD ) and ( DE ) do not intersect ( AB ), and thus ( C ) and ( E ) cannot lie on different sides of ( AB ). Therefore, if both ( C ) and ( E ) lie on the same side of ( AB ), then the necessary condition—where at least one side of the pentagon lies on the same side of one of its sides—is met.

Assume the statement on the silver casket is true. Then, exactly one of the statements is true. Therefore, the statement on the golden casket must be false (since only one statement can be true under this assumption). If the statement on the golden casket is false, then the portrait must be in the golden casket. 3. Now assume the statement on the silver casket is false. If the statement on the silver casket is false, \\"Exactly one of these two statements is true,\\" then both statements must be false because of the contradiction in the silver statement itself.

Conclusion: According to the reasoning steps, regardless of the truth value assigned to the inscriptions, the portrait should be in the golden casket.

Let's form and solve the equations based on these statements. # Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Define Coin Distribution for Player 3:** When player ( #3 ) receives coins through the rotations, let us assume: - They receive 1 coin ( k ) times. - Hence, they receive ( m - k ) coins in the remainder cases. 2. **Set up the Equation for Player 3 and Player 2:** The number of coins ( m ) minus the ones not received ( (n - 1)k ): [ (m - k) - (n - 1)k = 50 ] Simplifying, we get: [ m - k - (n - 1)k = 50 ] [ m - nk + k = 50 ] [ m = nk - k + 50 ] [ m = k(n - 1) + 50 , , cdots(1) ] 3. **Set up the Equation for Player 4:** For distribution, let’s see: With (3k) less than others: [ 3(m - 7k) - 7k(n - 3) = 74 ] Simplifying and opening the brackets: [ 3m - 21k - 7nk + 21k = 74 ] Substituting back using simpler variables: [ 3m - 21k - 7nk + 21k = 74 ] [ 3m = 21k + 7nk - 21k + 74 ] Simplifying, we get: [ 3m = 7nk - 3k + 74 , , cdots(2) ] 4. **Solve the System of Equations:** Substitute equation (1) into equation (2): [ m = k(n - 1) + 50 ] [ 3[k(n - 1) + 50] = 7nk - 3k + 74 ] [ 3kn - 3k + 150 = 7nk - 3k + 74 ] [ -150 + 74 = 3kn - 7nk ] Simplifying: [ 3kn - 7nk = 74 - 150 ] [ -4nk = -76 ] [ nk = 19 ] Finally: [ k = 3 ] Substituting back ( k ) into m from equation (1): [ m = 3(n - 1) + 50 ] [ 69 ] 5. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{69} ]"},{"prompt":"A table is created with the values of two functions ( f(n) ) and ( varphi(n) ) for natural values of ( n ); it turns out that the second differences in both tables are identical.

Let's define the new function ( F(n) = f(n) - varphi(n) ). 2. Given that the second differences of the functions ( f(n) ) and ( varphi(n) ) are identical, this implies that: [ Delta^2 f(n) = Delta^2 varphi(n) ] 3. Recall that the second difference ( Delta^2 g(n) ) for any function ( g ) is defined as: [ Delta^2 g(n) = (Delta g(n+1) - Delta g(n)) = (g(n+2) - 2g(n+1) + g(n)) ] 4. Since ( Delta^2 f(n) = Delta^2 varphi(n) ), it follows that: [ Delta^2 F(n) = Delta^2 (f(n) - varphi(n)) = Delta^2 f(n) - Delta^2 varphi(n) = 0 ] 5. Because the second difference of ( F(n) ) is zero, ( F(n) ) must be a linear function of ( n ). Mathematically, a function ( g(n) ) whose second difference is zero can be expressed as: [ F(n) = A n + B ] where ( A ) and ( B ) are constants. 6. Therefore, ( F(n) = f(n) - varphi(n) = A n + B ). 7. This implies that the differences ( f(1)-varphi(1), f(2)-varphi(2), f(3)-varphi(3), ldots ) form a sequence described by the linear function ( A n + B ). 8. Such a sequence, where each term increases or decreases by a constant difference ( A ), is known as an arithmetic progression.

Prove that during the process of this game, there will definitely be a situation where at least 7 students are holding flowers.","completion":"To solve this problem, we use proof by contradiction. Assume initially that fewer than 7 students are holding flowers. Under this assumption, there are two scenarios to consider during the flower-distributing game: one where any two adjacent students have at least one holding flowers, and another where it's impossible for any student to always be without flowers. By discussing these scenarios, we find contradictions, thus proving the assumption is incorrect and the original proposition is correct. Proof: Let's assume initially that fewer than 7 students are holding flowers. We label the 12 students as A1, A2, A3, …, A12 in a counterclockwise direction. 1. During the flower-distributing game, once any two adjacent students have one holding flowers, then after each round of distributing, at least one of them will always be holding flowers. In fact, if the student distributing flowers is not one of these two, then the number of flowers they hold can only increase, not decrease. If one of these two is the distributor, then the other student will definitely have flowers after the distribution. 2. It's impossible for any student to always be without flowers. This can be proven by contradiction. Suppose A1 always has no flowers, which means A2 never acts as a distributor, and the number of flowers A2 holds can only increase, not decrease. Since there are only 13 bouquets in total, after a finite number of distributions, A2 will no longer receive flowers. This implies that after a finite number of distributions, A3 will no longer act as a distributor. Similarly, after a finite number of distributions, A4 will no longer act as a distributor, and so on. After a finite number of distributions, none of the 12 students will act as a distributor, and the activity stops. This contradicts the fact that with 13 bouquets among 12 students, there will always be a student who can distribute flowers. From (1) and (2), we know that after several rounds of distribution, any two adjacent students will have at least one holding flowers, meaning at least 6 students will be holding flowers. If only 6 students are holding flowers, then the students holding flowers cannot be adjacent, otherwise, there would be two students without flowers next to each other.

We will draw an edge between two vertices ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) if the sum ( a_i + a_j ) is irrational. If ( a_i + a_j ) is rational, we will not draw an edge between these vertices. 3. To prove our statement, we will use a known result from graph theory: - In any graph with six vertices, either there exists a triangle where all three vertices are connected (all edges exist between them), or there exists an independent set of three vertices (no edges between them). This result is known due to the work presented in the citation: Kőnig-Hajos-Neukomm-Suranyi: \\"Mathematical Competition Problems II., The 1947 Competition.\\" 4. Assume for contradiction that there exists an independent set of three vertices in our graph ( G ). Let these vertices be ( a_i, a_j, a_k ). This means that the sums ( a_i + a_j ), ( a_i + a_k ), and ( a_j + a_k ) are all rational. 5. We can then write the following expressions: [ a_i + a_j = r_1, quad a_i + a_k = r_2, quad a_j + a_k = r_3 ] where ( r_1, r_2, r_3 ) are rational numbers. 6. Now, consider the expression: [ frac{1}{2} left( (a_i + a_j) + (a_i + a_k) - (a_j + a_k) right) = frac{1}{2} left( r_1 + r_2 - r_3 right) = a_i ] Here, ( r_1 + r_2 - r_3 ) is a rational number since the sum and difference of rational numbers are rational. Hence, ( a_i ) would be rational, which contradicts the premise that ( a_i ) is irrational. 7. Thus, our assumption that there exists an independent set of three vertices must be false. Therefore, by the known graph theory result, there must be a triangle in the graph ( G ) where all three vertices are connected (all three sums are irrational). Conclusion: There always exist three irrational numbers among ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 ) such that the sum of any two of them is irrational. Hence, the statement is proven.

According to the problem, the changes in seating positions are: - Varya moves 3 seats to the right - Galya moves 1 seat to the left - Diana and Ella swap places 3. Let's observe how these changes affect the seating: - Varya initially seated at position (v) will now occupy position (v+3). - Galya initially seated at position (g) will now occupy position (g-1). - Diana (initial position (d)) and Ella (initial position (e)) will swap places. 4. Since the total sum of the initial positions involves every seat from 1 to 5, the sum is: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 ] Thus, the total sum of their initial positions remains unchanged. 5. If their initial positions sum to 15, we then account for their movements: - Varya moves from (v) to (v+3). This increases her position by 3. - Galya moves from (g) to (g-1). This decreases her position by 1. - The swap of Diana and Ella doesn’t affect the sum as (d + e = e + d). 6. These changes should balance out such that the total remains 15. Let’s consider the equation represented by their movements: Original sum of their positions: [ a + v + g + d + e = 15 ] Adjusted positions after movements: [ (v + 3) + (g - 1) + e + d ] Since Diana and Ella swap places, the sum of their new positions is still (d + e). 7. To maintain the total sum, Anya’s position needs to offset the net change produced by other movements so that: [ v + 3 - 1 = v + 2 ] Therefore, the net change due to movements would sum to 2: [ a + v + (v + 2) + g + (g - 1) + d + e = 15 ] Simplifying: [ a + v + v + 2 + g + g - 1 + d + e = 15 ] [ a + 2v + 2g + d + e + 1 = 15 ] Since ((v + 3 -1) = 2) To balance such that the total sum remains: [ a = a_0 - 2 ] 8.

Clearly, the permutation ( i k j ) splits this subset, where (k) is the third element different from (i) and (j). Thus, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for ( n ), that is, if ( S ) is a collection of ( n-2 ) subsets of ({1, 2, dots, n}), each with at least 2 and at most ( n-1 ) elements, then there exists a permutation of ({1, 2, dots, n}) which splits all subsets in ( S ). 3. **Induction Hypothesis:** Suppose now ( S ) is a collection of ( n-1 ) subsets of ({1, 2, dots, n+1}), each with at least 2 and at most ( n ) elements. 4. **Finding a Suitable Element in ( S ):** We need to find an element ( k ) that belongs to all the ( n )-element members of ( S ) and at most one of the 2-element members of ( S ). Suppose ( S ) contains ( m ) two-element subsets and ( m' ) ( n )-element subsets. Then: [ (n+1) - m' ] numbers belong to all the ( n )-element members of ( S ). Because a maximum of ( m ) numbers can appear in more than one two-element subset of ( S ), at least: [ (n+1) - m - m' ] numbers appear in all ( n )-element subsets and at most one two-element subset of ( S ). Since ( n+1 - m - m' > 1 ), it is clear there exists such an element ( k ). Without loss of generality, we may assume ( n+1 ) is such an element. 5. **Considering Subsets Without ( n+1 ):** If we remove ( n+1 ), then all the ( n )-element subsets of ( S ) become ((n-1))-element subsets of ({1, 2, dots, n}), and at most one subset of ( S ) becomes a singleton. 6. **Finding the Permutation:** If a singleton is present, then we can find a permutation of ({1, 2, dots, n}) that splits the other ( n-2 ) members of ( S ). We can place ( n+1 ) anywhere in the permutation except adjacent to the singleton element. This ensures that the two-member subset of ( S ) is also split, thereby splitting all relevant subsets in ( S ). 7. **Handling the Last Member ( L ):** If no singleton exists, we take a permutation of ({1, 2, dots, n}) that splits ( n-2 ) members of ( S ). If the last member ( L ) of ( S ) does not contain ( n+1 ), we place ( n+1 ) in the permutation between two members of ( S ). This positioning ensures ( L ) is split. If ( L ) contains ( n+1 ), there must be some number ( i ) not in ( L ) and another number ( j ) that is in ( L ). We then place ( n+1 ) in the permutation such that ( i ) lies between ( n+1 ) and ( j ). This way, the permutation still splits ( L ).

Given that point B is at (3,0) and |AF|=|BF|, we can deduce that |AF|=|BF|=2 because the distance from F to B is simply the difference in their x-coordinates, which is 3-1=2. Since A lies on the parabola C: y^{2}=4x, and we know that |AF|=2, we can find the coordinates of A. Given that F is at (1,0), and assuming A is in the first quadrant for simplicity (the problem does not change if A is in the fourth quadrant due to symmetry), we can use the definition of the parabola to find A. The distance from A to the directrix (which is a vertical line x=-1 for this parabola) is equal to the distance from A to the focus F. Since F is at (1,0), and A lies on the parabola, the x-coordinate of A must be 1 unit to the right of the focus, making it (1+1,0)=(2,0). However, this contradicts the given |AF|=2. Therefore, we must find A such that it satisfies the parabola equation and the condition |AF|=|BF|. Given the equation of the parabola y^2 = 4x, and knowing that F is at (1,0), we look for a point A on the parabola that is equidistant from F and B. Without loss of generality, let's correct the approach to finding A by considering the parabola's equation and the distances involved. The correct approach to find A is to use the property of the parabola that states the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to its distance from the directrix. However, since we know |AF|=|BF|=2 and B is at (3,0), we directly use the given solution's outcome that A is at (1,2). This is derived from understanding that for A to satisfy |AF|=2, and given the geometry of the parabola, A must be positioned such that it is on the parabola and equidistant from F and B. The specific calculation for A's position is not detailed in the given solution, but it implies knowledge of the parabola's properties and the distances involved. To find |AB|, we use the distance formula or simply observe the geometric position of A and B. Since A is at (1,2) and B is at (3,0), the horizontal distance between them is 3-1=2 units, and the vertical distance is 2-0=2 units. Therefore, |AB| can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: [|AB| = sqrt{(3-1)^2 + (2-0)^2} = sqrt{2^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}] Thus, the length of AB is 2sqrt{2}.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of colorings without considering symmetries. We have 6 disks and we need to paint 3 blue, 2 red, and 1 green. The number of ways to choose 3 disks out of 6 to paint blue is binom{6}{3}. After choosing 3 disks for blue, we choose 2 out of the remaining 3 disks to paint red, which can be done in binom{3}{2} ways. The last disk will automatically be green. Thus, the total number of colorings without considering symmetries is: [ binom{6}{3} cdot binom{3}{2} = 20 cdot 3 = 60 ] Step 2: Identify the symmetries of the hexagon. The symmetries of a regular hexagon include: - 1 identity transformation (does nothing), - 3 reflections across lines through opposite vertices, - 2 rotations (120° and 240° clockwise). Step 3: Count the fixed points for each symmetry. 1. **Identity transformation**: Every coloring is fixed. Thus, there are 60 fixed points. 2. **Reflections**: Consider a reflection across a line through vertices 1 and 4. Disks 2 and 5 must be the same color, disks 3 and 6 must be the same color, and disks 1 and 4 can be any color. We can choose: - 1 color for disks 1 and 4 (3 choices), - 1 color for disks 2 and 5 (2 remaining choices), - The last color for disks 3 and 6. This gives 3 times 2 times 1 = 6 fixed points for each line of reflection. Since there are 3 lines of reflection, this contributes 3 times 6 = 18 fixed points. 3. **Rotations (120° and 240°)**: For a coloring to be fixed under a 120° rotation, all disks must be the same color, which is impossible given the constraints (3 blue, 2 red, 1 green). Thus, each rotation contributes 0 fixed points. Step 4: Apply Burnside's Lemma. The number of distinct colorings is the average number of fixed points: [ frac{1 cdot 60 + 3 cdot 6 + 2 cdot 0}{6} = frac{60 + 18 + 0}{6} = frac{78}{6} = 13 ] It appears there was a miscalculation in the original solution regarding the number of fixed points for the reflections.

Notice that the denominator can be rewritten as sqrt{x^2+4} geq sqrt{4} = 2 because for all x, x^2 geq 0, thus x^2 + 4 geq 4. Let t = sqrt{x^2 + 4} geq 2, then we transform the function into f(x) = frac{t^2 + 1}{t} = t + frac{1}{t}. We know that t + frac{1}{t} geq 2 by AM-GM inequality, where equality holds when t = 1. However, since t geq 2, the equality cannot hold, making option A incorrect. **For option B:** Given a > b > 0 and m > 0, we consider the fraction frac{b}{a} and frac{b+m}{a+m}. By the AM-GM inequality, we infer that adding the same positive number m to both numerator and denominator of a fraction less than 1 (frac{b}{a} in this case) will increase the value of the fraction. Thus, frac{b}{a} < frac{b+m}{a+m}, making option B correct. **For option C:** The statement concerns the existence of a real solution for x^2 + 4x + m = 0. If this is false, it means the equation has no real solutions. The discriminant Delta = 16 - 4m must be less than 0 for there to be no real solutions. Therefore, 16 - 4m < 0 implies m > 4. Hence, the range of m for which the statement is false is indeed (4, +infty), making option C correct. **For option D:** We examine the functions f(x) = sqrt{x-1} cdot sqrt{x+1} and g(x) = sqrt{x^2 - 1}. The domain for f(x) arises from the conditions x-1 geq 0 and x+1 > 0, resulting in x geq 1. For g(x), since x^2 - 1 geq 0, the domain is x geq 1 or x leq -1.

Part (a): 1. We start by considering the expression ((6+sqrt{35})^{1999}): [ (6+sqrt{35})^{1999} = a + bsqrt{35} ] 2. Let us denote its conjugate as: [ (6-sqrt{35})^{1999} = a - bsqrt{35} ] 3. By adding these two expressions, we get: [ (6+sqrt{35})^{1999} + (6-sqrt{35})^{1999} = (a + bsqrt{35}) + (a - bsqrt{35}) = 2a ] 4. Therefore: [ 2a = (6+sqrt{35})^{1999} + (6-sqrt{35})^{1999} ] 5. Notice that: [ (6-sqrt{35})^{1999} = frac{1}{(6+sqrt{35})^{1999}} ] 6. As ((6+sqrt{35})) is a number larger than (6), raising it to the 1999th power will give a very large number, thus making its reciprocal extremely small: [ frac{1}{(6+sqrt{35})^{1999}} < frac{1}{10^{1999}} < frac{1}{10^{1000}} ] 7. Therefore, the term ((6-sqrt{35})^{1999}) is negligible when compared to ((6+sqrt{35})^{1999}). 8. Hence we have: [ (6+sqrt{35})^{1999} approx 2a ] 9. Conclusively, the first 1000 digits after the decimal point of ((6+sqrt{35})^{1999}) are zeroes because: [ (6+sqrt{35})^{1999} + (6-sqrt{35})^{1999} approx (6+sqrt{35})^{1999} ] and ((6-sqrt{35})^{1999}) is so small that it does not affect the significant digits of the larger term.

By adding, we get: [ (6+sqrt{37})^{1999} + (6-sqrt{37})^{1999} = (a + bsqrt{37}) + (a - bsqrt{37}) = 2a ] 3. Similarly: [ (6-sqrt{37})^{1999} = frac{1}{(6+sqrt{37})^{1999}} ] 4. Since ((6+sqrt{37})) is larger than (6), raising it to the 1999th power makes it extremely large, and thus: [ frac{1}{(6+sqrt{37})^{1999}} < frac{1}{10^{1999}} < frac{1}{10^{1000}} ] 5. Therefore: [ (6-sqrt{37})^{1999} approx 0 ] 6. Hence, [ (6+sqrt{37})^{1999} approx 2a ] 7. Conclusion: The first 1000 digits after the decimal point of ((6+sqrt{37})^{1999}) are zeroes. Part (c): The expression ((6+sqrt{37})^{2000}) follows the same reasoning as in parts (a) and (b): 1. Start with: [ (6+sqrt{37})^{2000} = a + bsqrt{37} ] 2. Its conjugate is: [ (6-sqrt{37})^{2000} = a - bsqrt{37} ] 3. Adding both gives us: [ (6+sqrt{37})^{2000} + (6-sqrt{37})^{2000} = 2a ] 4. Moreover: [ (6-sqrt{37})^{2000} = frac{1}{(6+sqrt{37})^{2000}} ] 5.

Let (m_a), (m_b), and (m_c) be the lengths of the medians from the vertices (A), (B), and (C), and let (R) be the radius of the circumcircle of the triangle. 2. To begin with, we need to establish that (a + b + c > m_a + m_b + m_c). - Extend the median (AA1) (of length (m_a)) to point (D) such that (A1D = m_a). - Applying the triangle inequality to triangle (ADC), we get (b + c > 2m_a). 3. Similarly, we have: - (a + b > 2m_c), - (a + c > 2m_b). 4.

For every black point, the following applies: *There are exactly two green points that represent the distance 2020 from that black point.* Find the smallest possible number of green dots. (Walther Janous)","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given 2020 points in the plane, some of which are black and the rest are green. For every black point, there are exactly two green points that are at a distance of 2020 from that black point. We need to find the smallest possible number of green points. 2. **Rephrasing the Problem:** Finding the minimal number of green points is equivalent to finding the maximal number of black points. Let's denote the number of green points by ( n ) and the number of black points by ( b ). 3. **Analyzing the Constraints:** Each black point is associated with exactly two green points that are 2020 units away. Consider two green points ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ). There can be at most 2 black points that use both ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ) as their reference points. 4. **Generalizing the Pattern:** For any set of ( k ) green points, the number of pairs of green points is ( binom{k}{2} = frac{k(k-1)}{2} ). Each pair of green points can have at most 2 black points associated with it. Therefore, the maximum number of black points for ( k ) green points is ( 2 times frac{k(k-1)}{2} = k(k-1) ). 5. **Formulating the Equation:** Let ( n ) be the number of green points. The total number of points is ( m = 2020 ). We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that the number of black points ( b ) plus the number of green points ( n ) equals 2020: [ b + n = 2020 ] Since ( b leq n(n-1) ), we have: [ n(n-1) + n geq 2020 ] Simplifying, we get: [ n^2 geq 2020 ] 6. **Solving the Inequality:** To find the smallest ( n ) that satisfies ( n^2 geq 2020 ): [ n geq sqrt{2020} ] Calculating the square root: [ sqrt{2020} approx 44.94 ] Since ( n ) must be an integer, we round up to the nearest whole number: [ n = 45 ] 7. **Verification:** If ( n = 45 ), then the number of black points ( b ) is at most: [ b leq 45 times 44 = 1980 ] The total number of points is: [ b + n = 1980 + 45 = 2025 ] Since 2025 is greater than 2020, we need to check if 45 green points can indeed accommodate exactly 2020 points. If we use 45 green points, the number of black points is: [ 2020 - 45 = 1975 ] Since ( 45 times 44 = 1980 geq 1975 ), it is feasible.

Let r be the number of red segments connecting a cell in L to a cell in L', and v be the number of green segments connecting a cell in L to a cell in L'. 2. **Red and Green Token Relations**: Since each row has an equal number of red and green tokens, say n red tokens and n green tokens, the remaining connections are as follows: - The number of red tokens in L adjacent to green tokens in L' is n - r. - The number of green tokens in L adjacent to red tokens in L' is n - v. 3. **Simplifying the Token Relationships**: From the equality in the number of tokens, we have: [ n = (n - v) + r ] Solving for r in terms of v, we get: [ n = n - v + r implies r = v ] This shows that the number of red segments between any two adjacent rows is equal to the number of green segments. 4. **Vertical Segments Equality**: Since this holds true for any pair of adjacent rows, by induction across all 2m rows, we can deduce that the total number of vertical red segments in the entire board is equal to the total number of vertical green segments. 5. **Horizontal Segments Analysis**: By a similar argument, we can analyze pairs of adjacent columns.

To find the correct solution, we begin by noting that: 1. Since the GCD of the numbers is (202), each number must be a multiple of (202). 2. Suppose the four numbers are ( 202a, 202b, 202c, ) and (202d), where (a, b, c, d) are distinct integers. 3. The LCM of (202a, 202b, 202c, ) and (202d) must be ( 202 times text{LCM}(a, b, c, d) ). 4.

Find all funny numbers with the largest possible number of divisors.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Definition of a Funny Number:** A positive integer ( n ) is called *funny* if for all positive divisors ( d ) of ( n ), ( d+2 ) is a prime number. We need to find the funny number with the largest possible number of divisors. 2. **Initial Observations:** - Since ( d+2 ) must be prime for all divisors ( d ) of ( n ), ( n ) cannot be even. This is because if ( n ) were even, then ( 2 ) would be a divisor, and ( 2+2 = 4 ) is not a prime number. Therefore, ( 2 nmid n ). 3. **Checking Small Values:** - Let's check if ( n = 3^4 = 81 ) is funny. The divisors of ( 81 ) are ( 1, 3, 9, 27, 81 ). Adding 2 to each: [ 1+2 = 3, quad 3+2 = 5, quad 9+2 = 11, quad 27+2 = 29, quad 81+2 = 83 ] All of these are prime numbers, so ( 81 ) is funny. - Now, check ( n = 3^5 = 243 ). The divisors of ( 243 ) are ( 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 ). Adding 2 to each: [ 1+2 = 3, quad 3+2 = 5, quad 9+2 = 11, quad 27+2 = 29, quad 81+2 = 83, quad 243+2 = 245 ] ( 245 ) is not a prime number (since ( 245 = 5 times 49 )). Therefore, ( 243 ) is not funny. 4. **Considering Higher Powers and Other Primes:** - If ( p^2 mid n ) for some prime ( p > 3 ), then ( p+2 ) must be prime. This forces ( p equiv -1 pmod{3} ). However, ( p^2 + 2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), which is not possible since ( p^2 + 2 ) must be prime. - Similarly, if ( pq mid n ) for primes ( p, q > 3 ), then ( p+2 ) and ( q+2 ) must be primes, forcing ( p, q equiv -1 pmod{3} ). But ( pq + 2 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), which is not possible. 5. **Limiting the Form of ( n ):** - We can have at most ( n = 3^4 p ) with ( p > 3 ) prime. However, if ( p neq 5 ), then ( 5 ) divides at least one of ( p+2, 3p+2, 9p+2, 27p+2 ). For ( p = 5 ), we have ( 81p + 2 = 407 = 11 times 37 ), which is not prime. - Therefore, we can have at most ( n = 3^3 p ), and according to the above, only for ( p = 5 ). 6. **Verification:** - For ( n = 3^3 times 5 = 135 ), the divisors are ( 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 27, 45, 135 ). Adding 2 to each: [ 1+2 = 3, quad 3+2 = 5, quad 5+2 = 7, quad 9+2 = 11, quad 15+2 = 17, quad 27+2 = 29, quad 45+2 = 47, quad 135+2 = 137 ] All of these are prime numbers, so ( 135 ) is funny.

These are three consecutive integers. - Among any three consecutive integers, at least one of them is divisible by 3. - Therefore, ((n-1)n(n+1)) is divisible by 3. 3. **Combining the results:** - Since ((n-1)n(n+1)) is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by (2 times 3 = 6). 4. **Considering the term ((n^3 + 1)):** - The term ((n^3 + 1)) does not affect the divisibility by 6 because we have already established that ((n-1)n(n+1)) is divisible by 6. - Therefore, the entire expression ((n-1)n(n^3 + 1)) is divisible by 6.

Given that the logarithmic function log_{2}(x) is increasing, the condition x geq 4 implies log_{2}(x) geq log_{2}(4) = 2. Therefore, for y in the set N, we have y = log_{2}(x) - 1 geq 2 - 1 = 1.

Similarly, since A, R, B_1, Q are concyclic, we have angle B_1A_1C = angle ARB_1 = angle B_1QA_1. 6. We know that angle PQC_1 = 45^circ and angle RQB_1 = 65^circ. 7. Since A, P, C_1, Q are concyclic, angle C_1QA_1 = angle C_1PA. 8. Since A, R, B_1, Q are concyclic, angle B_1QA_1 = angle B_1RA. 9. We need to find angle PQR. Notice that angle PQR is the external angle for triangle PQC_1 and triangle RQB_1. 10.

Since angle C_1QB_1 = alpha and angle B_1QR = beta, we have: [ 45^circ + alpha + 65^circ + beta = 360^circ ] 13. Simplifying, we get: [ alpha + beta + 110^circ = 360^circ ] 14. Therefore: [ alpha + beta = 250^circ ] 15. Since angle PQR = alpha + beta, we have: [ angle PQR = 250^circ - 180^circ = 70^circ ] 16. However, this contradicts the given angles.

Consequently, by the definition of the logarithm, x_{2} can be expressed as x_{2} = e^{t}. 2. **Substituting into xln x = e^{2}**: With the substitution x_{2} = e^{t}, we can rewrite the equation for x_{2} as te^{t} = e^{2}.

Thus, we can find that f(2017) = f(1 + 672 × 3) = f(1) and f(2019) = f(673 × 3) = f(0). By combining the analytical expression of the function and its odd-even property, we can find the values of f(0) and f(1). Adding these values will give us our answer. This problem primarily tests the understanding and application of a function's odd-even property, periodicity, and symmetry. It is considered a basic question. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. Based on the given information, function f(x) satisfies f(x + frac{3}{2}) = f(x - frac{3}{2}), which implies f(x) = f(x - 3). 2. Therefore, function f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 3. 3.

When x is in (-frac{3}{2}, 0), f(x) = log_{frac{1}{2}}(1 - x). Thus, f(-1) = log_{frac{1}{2}}[1 - (-1)] = -1. 6. As f(x) is an odd function, f(1) = -f(-1) = 1.

Is there a fixed point M on the xaxis from which any line l intersects the hyperbola E at points P and Q, such that overrightarrow {FP} cdot overrightarrow{FQ} is constant?

Therefore, since the focal length c = 2, and the circle radius (which is also the semi-major axis of the hyperbola), a = sqrt{3}, we can find b by using the relationship c^2 = a^2 + b^2, yielding b = 1. Hence, the equation of hyperbola E is boxed{E: frac {x^{2}}{3} - y^{2}=1}. (Ⅱ) Method 1: Assume there exists a point M (m, 0) that satisfies the condition. 1. When the equation of line l is y = 0, then P(-sqrt{3}, 0), Q(sqrt{3}, 0), F(-2, 0). Thus, overrightarrow{FP} cdot overrightarrow{FQ} = (-sqrt{3} + 2, 0) cdot (sqrt{3} + 2, 0) = 1. 2. When the equation of line l is not y = 0, we can set line l to be x = ty + m (where t neq pm sqrt{3}) and substitute into the hyperbola equation frac {x^{2}}{3} - y^{2} = 1 to rearrange and obtain (t^{2} - 3)y^{2} + 2mty + m^{2} - 3 = 0 (where t neq pm sqrt{3}). Since the discriminant must be greater than zero (Delta > 0), it follows that m^{2} + t^{2} > 9. Let the two roots of the equation be y_1 and y_2, satisfying y_1 + y_2 = -frac{2mt}{t^{2} - 3} and y_1y_2 = frac{m^{2} - 3}{t^{2} - 3}. Thus, overrightarrow{FP} cdot overrightarrow{FQ} = (ty_1 + m + 2, y_1) cdot (ty_2 + m + 2, y_2) = (t^{2} + 1)y_1y_2 + t(m + 2)(y_1 + y_2) + (m + 2)^{2} = frac{t^{2} - 2m^{2} - 12m - 15}{t^{2} - 3}. overrightarrow{FP} cdot overrightarrow{FQ} is a constant value of 1 if and only if 2m^{2} + 12m + 15 = 3. Solving for m, we get m = -3 pm sqrt{3}. Since m = -3 + sqrt{3} does not satisfy the condition Delta > 0 for any t neq pm sqrt{3}, it is discarded. However, m = -3 - sqrt{3} does satisfy Delta > 0. In conclusion, the fixed point M is boxed{M(-3 - sqrt{3}, 0)}, and for any line l intersecting the hyperbola E at points P and Q through this M, overrightarrow{FP} cdot overrightarrow{FQ} remains constant at 1. The approach of Method 2 proceeds in a similar way to Method 1, reaching the same conclusion. Method 3 deals with the case where line l is not perpendicular to the x-axis, and we set l: y = k(x - m) (where k neq pm frac{sqrt{3}}{3}). Substituting into the hyperbola equation frac{x^{2}}{3} - y^{2} = 1 to rearrange and obtain (3k^{2} - 1)x^{2} - 6mk^{2}x + 3(m^{2}k^{2} + 1) = 0 (where k neq pm frac{sqrt{3}}{3}). Given the discriminant condition Delta > 0, we derive m^{2}k^{2} - 3k^{2} + 1 > 0. Let the two roots of the equation be x_1 and x_2, satisfying x_1 + x_2 = frac{6mk^{2}}{3k^{2} - 1} and x_1x_2 = frac{3m^{2}k^{2} + 3}{3k^{2} - 1}. Accordingly, overrightarrow{FP} cdot overrightarrow{FQ} = (x_{1} + 2, k(x_{1} - m)) cdot (x_{2} + 2, k(x_{2} - m)) = (1 + k^{2})x_{1}x_{2} + (2 - mk^{2})(x_{1} + x_{2}) + m^{2}k^{2} + 4 = frac{(2m^{2} + 12m + 15)k^{2} - 1}{3k^{2} - 1}. Same as before, overrightarrow{FP} cdot overrightarrow{FQ} equals 1 if and only if 2m^{2} + 12m + 15 = 3. Solving gives m = -3 pm sqrt{3}, and after considering the discriminant condition, we find that only m = -3 - sqrt{3} is acceptable. For the case where line l is perpendicular to the x-axis, we find that again M(-3 - sqrt{3}, 0) is the solution that yields overrightarrow{FP} cdot overrightarrow{FQ} = 1. In conclusion, we have verified the result to be consistent with the found answer that the fixed point M and the corresponding constant value are correct."},{"prompt":"Three cones with a common apex A touch each other externally, and the vertex angle of the first two cones is frac{pi}{3}.

D: There is no maximum value for frac{n}{m}.","completion":"Given the circle C: (x-2)^{2}+y^{2}=1, we identify its center at C(2,0) and note its radius is r=1. For a point P(m,n) on this circle, we explore the expressions involving m and n. **Step 1: Analyzing frac{n}{m}** Let's denote k=frac{n}{m}. This implies n=mk. Given P lies on the circle, we substitute n=mk into the circle's equation and analyze the implications for k. The distance from any point (m,n) on the circle to the line x=2 (which is the vertical line passing through the center of the circle) can be represented as frac{|2k|}{sqrt{1+k^{2}}}. This distance, due to the geometry of the circle, cannot exceed its radius, r=1. Therefore, we have: [ frac{|2k|}{sqrt{1+k^{2}}} leqslant 1 ] Solving this inequality for k yields: [ -frac{sqrt{3}}{3} leqslant k leqslant frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ] This tells us the range of frac{n}{m} is left[-frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, frac{sqrt{3}}{3}right]. Thus, the maximum value of frac{n}{m} is boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}}, making option A correct and option D incorrect. **Step 2: Analyzing m^{2}+n^{2}** The expression m^{2}+n^{2} represents the square of the distance from point P to the origin (0,0). The minimum distance from P to the origin occurs when P is closest to (0,0), which is at a distance of 1 unit away from the center of the circle (2,0) minus the radius 1, resulting in a minimum distance of 1 unit from the origin. The maximum distance occurs when P is farthest from (0,0), which is at a distance of 1 unit away from the center of the circle plus the radius 1, resulting in a maximum distance of 3 units from the origin. Therefore, the range of distances from P to the origin is [1,3], and thus the range of m^{2}+n^{2} is [1^2,3^2]=[1,9]. The maximum value of m^{2}+n^{2} is thus boxed{9}, making option B incorrect and option C correct. **Conclusion** The correct answers are options A and C."},{"prompt":"A certain middle school conducted a survey on the weight status of 500 seventhgrade students (unit: people).

What is the speed of the train?","completion":"To find the speed of the train, we need to calculate the relative speed between the train and the man. Since the man is walking in the same direction as the train, we subtract the man's speed from the train's speed to get the relative speed. First, let's convert the man's speed from km/hr to m/s, since the train's length is given in meters and the time is given in seconds. Speed of man in m/s = (Speed in km/hr) * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed of man in m/s = 3 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of man in m/s = 3000 / 3600 Speed of man in m/s = 5/6 m/s Now, let's calculate the relative speed using the time it takes for the train to pass the man and the length of the train. Relative speed (in m/s) = Length of train (in m) / Time taken (in s) Relative speed (in m/s) = 900 / 53.99568034557235 Relative speed (in m/s) ≈ 16.668 m/s (approximately) Now, we need to add the man's speed to the relative speed to get the train's actual speed. Train's speed (in m/s) = Relative speed (in m/s) + Man's speed (in m/s) Train's speed (in m/s) ≈ 16.668 + (5/6) Train's speed (in m/s) ≈ 16.668 + 0.833 Train's speed (in m/s) ≈ 17.501 m/s (approximately) Finally, let's convert the train's speed from m/s to km/hr. Train's speed (in km/hr) = (Speed in m/s) * (3600 s / 1 hr) * (1 km / 1000 m) Train's speed (in km/hr) ≈ 17.501 * (3600 / 1000) Train's speed (in km/hr) ≈ 63.0036 km/hr (approximately) Therefore, the speed of the train is approximately boxed{63.0036} km/hr."},{"prompt":"The postal service is selling stamps with famous people pictured on them.

Now, consider if the problem's result is always valid by examining the specific lattice points ( A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0,1), D(1,1) ): For any point ( E(x,y) in L ), the even-odd distribution of ( (x, y) ) correlates with one of the points ( A, B, C, ) or ( D ), so each pairwise segment contains an integer point. 15.

Chomp is a game in which players take turns choosing a square from the grid and then \\"eating\\" (removing) that square and all squares to its right and below. The objective is to avoid being the player who eats the poisoned square at the top-left corner ((1,1)). To achieve this, we'll use a symmetric strategy. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the strategy: 1. **Initial Move by Alice**: - Alice begins by choosing the square ((2, 2)) and removes all squares to its right and below it. - This move effectively removes all squares ((x, y)) such that (x geq 2) or (y geq 2), which means all squares that have either coordinate ( geq 2 ) are eaten. 2. **Remaining Board**: - After Alice's move, the remaining board will only have squares ((1, 1)), ((1, 2)), and ((2, 1)) remaining. - Here's the configuration: \`\`\` (1,1) (0,0) (0,0) \`\`\` where ((0,0)) represents a removed square. 3. **Symmetric Strategy**: - From this point forward, Alice adopts a symmetric strategy. - Whenever Bob chooses a square, Alice will choose the symmetrical counterpart of that square relative to the board. 4. **Maintaining Symmetry**: - The symmetry here means that if Bob eats square ((1,2)), Alice eats ((2,1)), and vice versa. - If Bob chooses ((1,1)), Bob loses immediately since ((1,1)) is the poisoned square. 5. **Ensuring Bob's Loss**: - In every scenario, this symmetric play forces Bob to eventually face the poisoned square first, as Alice will never be forced to remove ((1,1)) herself by mirroring Bob's moves. 6. **Conclusion**: - By playing symmetrically and always mirroring Bob's moves, Alice ensures that Bob is the one who has no choice but to eat the poisoned square ((1,1)) eventually. Thus, Alice wins by using the symmetric strategy outlined above.

We are given that no city is directly connected with every other city, and for each pair ((A, B)) of cities, there is exactly one route using at most two flights between them. 4. We need to count the number of vertices in ( G ) in two ways. Obviously, the number of vertices is ( N ). 5. Pick any vertex ( v_i ). Note that any two members of ( A_i ) do not share a common edge. Otherwise, there would be two different valid paths from ( v_i ) to them, which contradicts the given condition. 6. Any vertex ( W ) that is not a neighbor of ( v_i ) must be a neighbor of exactly one vertex from ( A_i ). If ( W ) is not a neighbor of any vertex from ( A_i ), then ( v_i ) and ( W ) do not have a path of length 1 or 2 between them.

However, for a = 1, which makes (a - 1)x^2 + 2(a - 1)x always zero, the inequality is solely based on -4 geq 0 being false; thus, a=1 does satisfy the condition that the solution set is empty. 2. When a - 1 > 0, which means a > 1, the quadratic function (a - 1)x^2 + 2(a - 1)x opens upwards. The inequality will have a solution set that is not empty, this case doesn't satisfy the condition. 3. When a - 1 < 0, which means a < 1, the quadratic function (a - 1)x^2 + 2(a - 1)x opens downwards.

The sum of the lengths of the red sides is less than half of the perimeter of the polygon, and no two blue sides are adjacent. We need to prove that this polygon cannot have an inscribed circle. 1. Let's consider a typical blue side (BC) of the polygon, with its adjacent sides (AB) and (CD) being red (this is given by the condition that no blue side is adjacent to another blue side). 2. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that the polygon is circumscribed by a circle. Let (P, Q, R) be the points of tangency of the sides (AB, BC,) and (CD) with the inscribed circle, respectively. 3. By the properties of tangents to a circle from a given point, the tangents drawn from the same external point are equal in length. Therefore, we have: [ BP = BQ quad text{and} quad CR = CQ ] These equalities arise because (BP) and (BQ) are tangents from point (B), and (CR) and (CQ) are tangents from point (C). 4. Notice that the segments (BP) and (CR) only border one blue side each (since (P) and (R) are points of tangency related to the red sides next to (BC)). Thus, these segments are connected through the red sides and account only once for the blue segment (BC). 5. Let (s) be the perimeter of the polygon. Given that the sum of the lengths of the red sides is less than half of the perimeter, we have: [ sum (text{lengths of red sides}) < frac{s}{2} ] 6. Considering the alternative approach, if we sum up the lengths of all the sides, it must equal the perimeter (s). 7. Since (BP = BQ) and (CR = CQ), the sum of segment lengths surrounding the blue sides (considering distribution among red sides as well) is balanced or equals among red and blue configurations around the inscribed circle structure, suggesting equal fine structure tilt: [ text{Total sum of tangents cuts} implies sum (text{lengths of blue sides}) = sum (text{lengths of red sides}) ] 8. This is a contradiction because it suggests: [ sum (text{lengths of red sides}) = sum (text{lengths of blue sides}) lessapprox frac{s}{2} ] But ( sum (text{lengths of red sides}) < frac{s}{2} implies sum (text{lengths of blue sides}) > frac{s}{2} ), suggesting an imbalance-hence inconsistency. 9. Conclusively, the suppositional dependency contradicts given that the sum of red lengths less than perimeter halves cannot sustain conceivable equal ramification for an inscribed circle.

Then he formed all possible fourdigit numbers without repeating any of the digits. The sum of all these numbers turned out to be 73,326. What four digits did Petya pick?","completion":"1. Let's denote the four distinct digits Petya thought of as ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ). The total number of four-digit numbers that can be formed using these digits, without repetition, is given by ( 4! ). Thus, there are [ 4! = 24 ] four-digit numbers. 2. In every four-digit number formed, each digit ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) will appear exactly once in each place (units, tens, hundreds, and thousands) among the 24 numbers. 3. To see how often each digit appears in a particular place, we observe that each digit will appear in each place exactly: [ frac{24}{4} = 6 text{ times} ] 4. Therefore, if we sum all 24 numbers, each digit ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) will contribute to each place value (units, tens, hundreds, and thousands) 6 times. Hence, the total contribution of each digit to the sum of all numbers is multiplied by ( 1111 ) (i.e., ( 1000 + 100 + 10 + 1 )). 5. Let's denote the sum of the digits ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) as ( S = a + b + c + d ). 6. Thus, the total sum of all 24 numbers formed is: [ 6 cdot (a + b + c + d) cdot 1111 = 73326 ] 7. Substituting and simplifying, we get: [ 6 cdot S cdot 1111 = 73326 ] [ S cdot 1111 = frac{73326}{6} ] [ S cdot 1111 = 12221 ] [ S = frac{12221}{1111} ] [ S = 11 ] 8. The only way to express 11 as the sum of four distinct non-zero digits is: [ 11 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 ] 9. Therefore, the four digits that Petya thought of are (boxed{1, 2, 3, 5})."},{"prompt":"A rectangular table 9 rows times 2008 columns is fulfilled with numbers 1 , 2 , ..., 2008 in a such way that each number appears exactly 9 times in table and difference between any two numbers from same column is not greater than 3 . What is maximum value of minimum sum in column (with minimal sum)?","completion":"1. **Define the problem and notation:** We are given a rectangular table with 9 rows and 2008 columns. Each number from 1 to 2008 appears exactly 9 times in the table. We denote by sigma(c) the sum of the entries in column c. We need to find the maximum value of the minimum sum in any column, denoted as max min sigma(c). 2. **Initial claim and example:** We claim that max min sigma(c) = 24. This can be realized by a specific arrangement of numbers in the columns. For example, consider the following columns: - Three columns with entries (1,1,1,3,3,3,4,4,4), each having sigma(c) = 24. - One column with entries (2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5,5). - One column with entries (2,2,2,2,5,5,5,5,5). - The remaining columns with entries (n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n,n) for 6 leq n leq 2008. 3. **Constraints on columns containing the number 1:** The columns containing the number 1 can only have entries from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} because the difference between any two numbers in the same column cannot be greater than 3. Since there are only 9 cdot 4 = 36 such values available, it means that the number of columns k containing the number 1 satisfies 9k leq 36, hence k leq 4. 4. **Case analysis based on the number of columns k containing the number 1:** - **If k = 1:** The column has sigma(c_1) = 9 cdot 1 = 9 < 24. - **If k = 2:** The sum of the entries in these two columns is sigma(c_1) + sigma(c_2) leq 9 cdot 1 + 9 cdot 4 = 45. Hence, one of them has sigma(c) leq leftlfloor frac{45}{2} rightrfloor = 22 < 24. - **If k = 4:** The sum of the entries in these four columns is sigma(c_1) + sigma(c_2) + sigma(c_3) + sigma(c_4) = 9 cdot 1 + 9 cdot 2 + 9 cdot 3 + 9 cdot 4 = 90. Hence, one of them has sigma(c) leq leftlfloor frac{90}{4} rightrfloor = 22 < 24. - **If k = 3:** The sum of the entries in these three columns is sigma(c_1) + sigma(c_2) + sigma(c_3) leq 9 cdot 1 + 9 cdot 3 + 9 cdot 4 = 72. Hence, one of them has sigma(c) leq leftlfloor frac{72}{3} rightrfloor = 24. 5. **Conclusion:** Since we have shown that for k = 3, it is possible to have a column sum of 24, and for k = 1, 2, 4, the minimum column sum is less than 24, we conclude that the maximum value of the minimum sum in any column is 24.

Prove that the number ( q ) is composite.","completion":"1. **Definition of Consecutive Odd Prime Numbers**: Let ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) be two consecutive odd prime numbers. We assume ( p_1 < p_2 ). By the property of prime numbers and their distribution, ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) are such that there is no odd prime number between them. 2. **Expression for ( q )**: Given ( q = frac{p_1 + p_2}{2} ), we substitute the prime numbers ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) into this expression. 3. **Inequality Involving ( q )**: Note that ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) differ by at least 2 since they are consecutive odd primes. We proceed as follows: [ p_1 < frac{p_1 + p_2}{2} = q < p_2 ] This inequality shows that ( q ) lies strictly between ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ). 4. **Even Nature of Expression**: Both ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) are odd primes. The sum of two odd numbers is even, which implies: [ p_1 + p_2 = text{even number} ] Dividing this even sum by 2 results in an integer, ( q ), which is also an integer. 5. **Analyzing the Primality of ( q )**: Since ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) are consecutive odd primes with no other odd primes between them, ( q ) is not an odd prime number. ( q ) itself cannot be a prime number because it falls between ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ), and it cannot equal either ( p_1 ) or ( p_2 ). 6. **Conclusion on ( q )**: Therefore, ( q ) must be a composite number because it is situated between two consecutive odd primes and cannot be prime itself. Thus, we have shown that the number ( q ) calculated as the average of two consecutive odd primes ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) is always a composite number. This completes the proof.
