First, we prove that if ( f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) and ( f circ f = f ), then the range of ( f ) is either ( mathbb{R}, [a, infty), (-infty, b], [a, b], {ell} ). If ( f ) is constant, the range is a singleton, which is not interesting. Assume ( f ) is non-constant. Since ( f ) is continuous, it must have the Intermediate Value Property (IVP). If ( f(a) < k < f(b) ), then every such ( k ) is in the range of ( f ). This means the range of ( f ) is of the form ( (m, M), (m, M], [m, M), [m, M] ), where ( M ) is the supremum and ( m ) is the infimum of the set. Now, ( M ) can be ( +infty ) and ( m ) can be ( -infty ). Assume ( m ) and ( M ) are finite. We show that if both are finite, they both get achieved. For some ( delta > 0 ), let ( x_{delta} in mathbb{R} ) such that ( f(x_{delta}) = m + delta ). By ( f circ f = f ), we have ( f(m + delta) = m + delta ). Taking the limit as ( delta rightarrow 0^{+} ): [ lim_{delta rightarrow 0^{+}} f(m + delta) = lim_{delta rightarrow 0^{+}} (m + delta) implies f(lim_{delta rightarrow 0^{+}} (m + delta)) = m implies f(m) = m ] So ( m ) is in the range. Similarly, for ( M ), taking ( lim_{delta rightarrow 0^{-}} f(M - delta) ) shows ( M ) is in the range. Hence, the range of ( f ) is either ( mathbb{R}, (-infty, a], [b, infty), [a, b] ). Now, since ( f ) is non-constant, ( f'(x) neq 0 ) for all ( x ). From the relation ( f'(f(x)) = 1 ), if the range of ( f ) is not ( mathbb{R} ), one of the extremum gets achieved. W.L.O.G, say the maximum is ( b ), then ( f(b) = b ). Since the range of ( f ) is ( mathbb{R} ), ( b ) would be an interior point.

Hence, the range of ( f ) must be ( mathbb{R} ). 3. **Part (c):** If ( g ) satisfies ( g circ g circ g = g ), then ( g ) is onto.

Since ( g circ g = x ), the inverse of ( g ) exists, making ( g ) injective. A continuous injective function is strictly monotone, so ( g ) is strictly monotone. If ( g ) is strictly increasing, assume ( x < g(x) ). Then: [ g(g(x)) = x < g(x) < x ] This is a contradiction.

Consequently, n must be an odd number since 2k+1 is always odd. The integers n have to be less than 150, therefore (2k+1) < 150 gives k < 74.5. Since k is an integer, k can be at most 74, giving potential candidate values for n as all odd numbers from 1 to 149, i.e., there are frac{149-1}{2} + 1 = 75 possible values for n.

Consider the angles (angle D_1AD_2) and (angle B_1BB_2): - Both are right angles because (D_1D_2) and (B_1B_2) are each perpendicular to (l_1) and (l_2). 8. Therefore, the triangles (D_1AD_2) and (B_1BB_2) are also congruent by the HL Congruence Theorem: - (AD_1 = BB_1) - (AD_2 = BB_2) - (angle D_1AD_2 = angle B_1BB_2 = 90^circ). 9. Since the triangles are congruent and their respective measuring angles are (90^circ), it follows that: [ B_1B_2 perp D_1D_2. ] Also, because of the congruent triangle's property, [ B_1B_2 = D_1D_2. ] # Conclusion: The segments (B_1B_2) and (D_1D_2) are equal and perpendicular to each other.

We aim to show that the cardinality of set ( A ) is greater than or equal to that of set ( B ). 5. Note that the numbers in ( A ) and ( B ) are not divisible by ( 2 ) or ( 5 ).

The smallest square we can make will have a side length that is a common multiple of both 12 cm and 15 cm. The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 15 is the smallest number that is a multiple of both numbers. We can find the LCM by listing the multiples of each number until we find a common one: Multiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, ...

These cuts effectively remove portions of (P_{text{outer}}). 3. **Impact of cuts**: - Each cut made to isolate and remove the inner polygon (P_{text{inner}}) corresponds to reducing the perimeter of the remaining part of (P_{text{outer}}). - More specifically, any edge along which a cut is made contributes to reducing the overall perimeter. 4. **Comparison of perimeters**: - As the cuts along the sides of (P_{text{outer}}) reduce the perimeter step by step, the cumulative effect of these cuts means that the final perimeter of (P_{text{inner}}) must be less than the initial perimeter of (P_{text{outer}}). - If the perimeter of (P_{text{inner}}) were not smaller, then the cuts would not have reduced the perimeter, which contradicts the iterative reduction effect seen from making these cuts.

Since the total number of students is still 300 (because we are only redistributing the students, not adding or removing any), we can write: G = (x/100) * (300) (4) Now, let's use equations (1) and (2) to express B and G in terms of x and y: From equation (2), we can write B as B = (x/y) * G. Substituting this into equation (1), we get: (x/y) * G + G = 300 G * (x/y + 1) = 300 G = 300 / (x/y + 1) G = 300y / (x + y) (5) Now, let's substitute G from equation (5) into equation (4): 300y / (x + y) = (x/100) * 300 y / (x + y) = x/100 100y = x(x + y) 100y = x^2 + xy (6) Now, we need to find the value of z.

The next two smaller boxes contained within it are boxes of rank n-1, and so on down to boxes of rank 1, which contain the coins.

The defect is defined as the difference between the number of heads and tails within that box. Specifically, for a box of rank n, we denote this defect by d. 3. **Initial Condition**: Initially, the absolute value of the defect (|d|) for the largest box is at most 2^n because there are 2^n coins in total. 4. **Key Idea**: To solve the problem, we need to ensure that we can always find a box whose flipping reduces the absolute value of the defect by at least half. We aim to show that for any initial configuration, we can achieve this reduction in no more than n moves. 5. **Consider d > 0**: Assume initially that d > 0. To find a contradiction, assume that it is impossible to find such a box whose flipping would halve the defect. 6. **Effect of Flipping a Box**: When flipping a box with a defect d_1, the defect changes by subtracting 2d_1 from d. So, the new defect would be (|d - 2d_1|). 7. **Contradiction**: According to our assumption of impossibility, we must have [ |d-2d_1| > frac{d}{2}. ] This inequality can only hold if either d_1 < frac{d}{4} or d_1 > frac{3d}{4}. 8. **Hierarchical Defect Analysis**: - Each box of rank 1 cannot have a defect more than 1, which is less than frac{d}{4}. - Consequently, each box of rank 2 also must have a defect less than frac{d}{4} since its content is made up of boxes of rank 1 whose defects sum to less than half of the box of rank 2's total defect. - Continuing this reasoning, we propagate upwards through the hierarchy of boxes. - Finally, we conclude that even the defect of the largest box must be less than frac{d}{2}, which contradicts the assumption that it is initially d and can only be halved or greater. 9. **Conclusion**: This contradiction shows that our initial assumption—that it is impossible to find a box whose flipping would reduce |d| by at least half—cannot hold. 10. **Final Steps**: This argument holds irrespective of the specific initial configuration or the specific n. Since |d| leq 2^n initially, and flipping reduces |d| by at least half, we can achieve a d=0 configuration in at most n steps.

Task 2: Calculating the Yield - To find the number of plants per square meter that makes the yield of crop A per square meter 4.8 kg, we set up the equation: [ (2+x)(1.2-0.1x) = 4.8 ] Simplifying this equation, we get: [ 2.4 + 1.2x - 0.2x - 0.1x^2 = 4.8 implies x^2 - 10x + 24 = 0 ] Solving the quadratic equation, we find: [ x_1 = 4, quad x_2 = 6 ] Therefore, to achieve a yield of 4.8 kg per square meter, the number of plants per square meter should be either 6 or 8 (since x+2=6 or x+2=8). - The answer is: boxed{6 text{ plants or } 8 text{ plants per square meter}}.

The 7-notebook pack offers the best value, followed by the 4-notebook pack, and then the single notebooks. We should prioritize buying the 7-notebook packs, then 4-notebook packs, and single notebooks if necessary.

We have 6 periods and need to choose 3 of them for the math courses. This can be done in binom{6}{3} ways. After choosing the periods, we can arrange the 3 courses in 3! ways. Therefore, the total number of unrestricted arrangements is: [ binom{6}{3} times 3! = 20 times 6 = 120 ] Step 2: Use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE) to exclude invalid arrangements We need to exclude cases where two or more math courses are scheduled in consecutive periods. **Case 1: Two consecutive courses** - Consider two consecutive periods as a single \\"block.\\" There are 5 possible positions for this block (periods 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6). - Choose 2 courses to place in this block, which can be done in binom{3}{2} times 2! = 3 times 2 = 6 ways (choose 2 courses and arrange them). - Place the remaining course in one of the remaining 4 periods, which can be done in 4 ways. - Total for this case: 5 times 6 times 4 = 120 ways. **Case 2: Three consecutive courses** - Consider three consecutive periods as a block.

We need to correct the overcounting in Case 1, where each arrangement of two consecutive courses is counted multiple times if there are multiple ways to form consecutive blocks. **Correction for overcounting in Case 1:** - Each specific arrangement of two consecutive courses is counted three times (once for each possible remaining period for the third course that could also form a consecutive block).

Therefore, the total cost of operation for n workers in an 8-hour workday is the sum of the maintenance fee and the wages paid to all workers, which can be expressed as: [500 + 8(15n).] Each worker produces 5 widgets per hour, and each widget is sold for 3.10.

Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing in (-infty, 1) and monotonically increasing in (1, +infty). When a < 0, setting f'(x) = 0 yields x = 1 and x = ln (-a). (i) If a < -e, for x in (-infty, 1), we have f'(x) > 0. For x in (1, ln (-a)), we have f'(x) < 0, and for x in (ln (-a), +infty), we have f'(x) > 0.

Define h(x) = (x-1)e^{x} + x - 1 - k, and its first derivative is h'(x) = xe^{x} + 1. For x geqslant 0, since h'(x) = xe^{x} + 1 > 0, h(x) is monotonically increasing.

So the time it takes him to walk back with the wind against him is ( 1.25T ). Given that it takes him 7 minutes with the wind against him, we can write: [ 1.25T = 7 ] [ T = frac{7}{1.25} ] [ T = 5.6 text{ minutes} ] However, this is not possible because the time it takes with the wind against him should be longer than the time with the wind in his favor, not shorter. There seems to be a mistake in the information provided. Let's re-evaluate the information given. If it takes Dante 15 minutes to go to Hidden Lake with the wind in his favor, and it takes him 7 minutes to walk back to the Park Office with the wind against him, the total time spent walking is ( 15 + 7 = 22 ) minutes. Since he has been gone for 32 minutes altogether, the time he spent walking to the Lake Park restaurant must be ( 32 - 22 = 10 ) minutes. However, this 10 minutes includes the time with the wind in his favor, which is a 20% reduction of the time it would take without any wind. Let's denote the time it takes to walk to the Lake Park restaurant without any wind as ( R ). So we have: [ 0.8R = 10 ] [ R = frac{10}{0.8} ] [ R = 12.5 text{ minutes} ] Therefore, the walk from the Park Office to the Lake Park restaurant without any wind would take Dante boxed{12.5} minutes."},{"prompt":"Five coins, labeled ( A, B, C, D, ) and ( E ), are stacked flat on a table.

Let's analyze the situation step-by-step. 1. **Understanding the probabilities when there is one advisor**: - With one advisor, say with a probability (p) of being correct, King Arthur will follow the correct advice with probability (p). 2. **Understanding the probabilities when there are two advisors**: - If both advisors give the same answer, they are either both correct or both incorrect. - Both advisors are correct: This occurs with probability (p^2) because each advisor has a probability (p) of being correct. - Both advisors are incorrect: This occurs with probability (q^2) where (q = 1 - p). 3. **Probability distribution for different outcomes**: - Both advisors give the correct answer: The king follows their advice with certainty (p^2 times 1). - Both advisors give the incorrect answer: The king follows their incorrect advice with certainty (q^2 times 1). - One advisor gives a correct answer and the other gives an incorrect answer: This occurs with probability (2pq).

Therefore, one can be fired without affecting the decision-making accuracy of King Arthur. 8. **Considering Merlin’s strategic answer**: - Merlin must consider the impact of his response on his job security. Persifal is honest and would say the optimal solution is to fire one of them because it doesn’t decrease the probability of making correct decisions. - Merlin, thinking about minimizing his chance of being fired, would realize his optimal strategy aligns with being honest, as the correct answer is evident. 9. **Likelihood of being fired**: - Since Merlin would say the same as Persifal (to fire one), the chance of Merlin being the one fired would be based on a coin flip if King Arthur decides to follow through with the dismissal.

This implies that these 5 friends must each have 6 friends (since friendship is mutual and any two friends have different numbers of friends). - Conversely, if there are students with 6 friends, these friends must each have 5 friends. 3. **Construct a Minimum Class Size:** - Suppose we divide the class into two groups: one group of students with 5 friends and the other group with 6 friends. - Consider the group of students with 5 friends. Let the number of such students be ( x ). Each of these students can only be friends with students from the other group. - Similarly, let ( y ) be the number of students in the group with 6 friends. - Since mutual friendships are between a group of 5 friends and a group of 6 friends, a student with 5 friends must have all their friends in the ( y ) group and vice versa. 4. **Balance the Group Sizes:** - Let's denote ( x = 5 ) (each having exactly 5 friends). - Consequently, ( y = 6 ) (each having exactly 6 friends). - This results in: [ text{Total students} = x + y = 5 + 6 = 11 ] 5. **Verification:** - To ensure this configuration works: - Each of the 6 students has 5 friends (which are the 5 students in the other group) and vice versa. - Each of the 5 students has 6 friends (which are the 6 students in the other group). 6. **Conclusion:** - The smallest number of students in the class that satisfies all given conditions is 11.

Point M is chosen arbitrarily on arc AD (not containing points B and C) of the circumcircle of the trapezoid. We need to prove that the feet of the perpendiculars dropped from vertices A and D on the segments BM and CM lie on the same circle. 1. Denote K, L, N, and S as the feet of the perpendiculars from A and D to BM and CM respectively (see figure). 2. Since angle AKM = angle ANM = 90^circ, points A, K, N, and M lie on a circle. This is because any quadrilateral where a pair of opposite angles are right angles is inscribed in a circle. 3. Similarly, since angle DLS = angle DSM = 90^circ, points D, L, S, and M lie on a circle. 4. Next, consider the equality of the inscribed angles angle AMB and angle DMC based on the congruence of sides AB and CD. Specifically: [ angle AMB = angle DMC ] since the angles subtend the same arcs respectively on the circumcircle of the trapezoid. 5. Consequently, considering angle AKM = angle ANM = 90^circ and angle DLS = angle DLM = 90^circ, both sets of points (A, K, N, M) and (D, L, S, M) lie on respective circles. 6. To conclude, by considering the relationship between these inscribed angles and the perpendiculars drawn from A and D, we find: [ angle KNL = angle LSM = 90^circ ] 7.

Steven has 55 acres in total, with 15 acres on hilly terrain. This leaves 40 acres of flat and dry farmland. At a rate of 10 acres per day, it would take him: 40 acres / 10 acres per day = 4 days to plow the flat and dry farmland. Now, let's calculate the time it takes to plow the hilly terrain. His efficiency drops by 30% on hilly terrain, so he can only plow 70% of the 10 acres he can usually plow on flat terrain. 70% of 10 acres = 0.7 * 10 = 7 acres per day. So, for the 15 acres of hilly terrain, it would take him: 15 acres / 7 acres per day = 2.14 days. Since he can't work a fraction of a day, we'll round up to the nearest whole day, which means it will take him 3 days to plow the hilly terrain. Now, let's calculate the time it takes to mow the grassland. Steven can mow 12 acres per day in sunny weather. He has 30 acres of grassland to mow, with 5 days of rain during the mowing period. First, let's calculate the mowing on rainy days. On rainy days, his efficiency decreases by 40%, so he can only mow 60% of the 12 acres he can usually mow in sunny weather. 60% of 12 acres = 0.6 * 12 = 7.2 acres per day (which matches the given information).

Each subsequent number in the sequence is 3 more than the previous (since they are all divisible by 3). So, to find the 33rd number, we can multiply 32 by 3 and add it to 102: 32 * 3 = 96 Now, add this to the first number in the sequence: 102 + 96 = 198 So, the 33rd number that is divisible by 3 after 102 is 198.

Since the total percentage must equal 100%, we can find the percentage of sales in the stationery section by subtracting the total percentage of the other sections from 100%: 100% - 75% = 25% Now that we know the stationery section makes up 25% of the sales, we can calculate the number of sales in that section.

If we set sqrt{x} - 1 = t (Note that t geq -1 since sqrt{x} geq 0), we have: f(t) = t^{2} + 4t + 3. Now substitute t back with sqrt{x} - 1 to get: f(sqrt{x} - 1) = (sqrt{x} - 1)^{2} + 4(sqrt{x} - 1) + 3. Since t = sqrt{x} - 1, we have sqrt{x} = t + 1. Therefore, x = (t+1)^{2}.

We need to prove that: [ sum_{(a,b) in S} a = frac{1}{2} sum_{(a,b) in S} b. ] 2. **Existence and uniqueness of ( b ) for a given ( a ):** Since ( 2017 ) is a prime congruent to ( 1 mod 4 ), there exists an integer ( k ) such that ( k^2 equiv -1 pmod{2017} ).

This ensures ( a^2 + b^2 equiv 0 pmod{2017} ). 3. **Uniqueness of ( b ):** Assume there are two such ( b ), say ( b_1 ) and ( b_2 ). Then: [ b_1^2 equiv b_2^2 pmod{2017}. ] This implies: [ 2017 mid (b_1 - b_2)(b_1 + b_2). ] Since ( 0 < b_1 + b_2 < 2017 ), it must be that ( 2017 mid b_1 - b_2 ), hence ( b_1 = b_2 ). This proves the uniqueness of ( b ) for each ( a ). 4. **Define the set ( S_a ):** Let: [ S_a = {a mid exists b : (a, b) in S}. ] We will show that the map ( a rightarrow b - a ) is a bijection from ( S_a ) to itself. 5. **Bijection proof:** Note that: [ (b - a)^2 + (b + a)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2) equiv 0 pmod{2017}. ] If ( a + b > frac{p-1}{2} ), then ( 0 < 2017 - (a + b) leq frac{p-1}{2} ).

Then: [ b_1^2 + a_1^2 - 2a_1b_1 = b_2^2 + a_2^2 - 2a_2b_2. ] This implies: [ a_1b_1 equiv a_2b_2 pmod{2017}. ] Since ( b_1 equiv pm ka_1 ) and ( b_2 equiv pm ka_2 pmod{2017} ), we have: [ ka_1^2 equiv pm ka_2^2 pmod{2017}. ] If ( a_1^2 equiv -a_2^2 pmod{2017} ), then ( 2017 mid a_1^2 + a_2^2 ), and by uniqueness, ( b_1 = a_2 ) and ( b_2 = a_1 ), which gives ( a_1 = a_2 ). If ( a_1^2 equiv a_2^2 pmod{2017} ), then ( 2017 mid a_1^2 - a_2^2 ), and ( a_1 = a_2 ). This proves injectivity. 7. **Conclusion:** Since the map ( a rightarrow b - a ) is injective and maps from a finite set to itself, it is also a bijection. Therefore, the sums can be rewritten as: [ sum_{(a,b) in S} a = sum_{(a,b) in S} (b - a). ] By the above, it follows that both sides equal: [ sum_{a in S_a} a. ] This solves the problem.

Rotation is defined as the transformation of a figure by turning it around a point O through a certain angle. Therefore, the motion of a moving car's wheels is rotational. This question primarily tests the understanding of shape rotation and translation. The similarities between rotation and translation are that the position changes, the size remains the same, the shape remains the same, and they both occur in the same plane. The difference is that in translation, the direction of motion remains constant, while in rotation, the motion occurs around a point or axis in a circular path."},{"prompt":"Let PQRST be a convex pentagon with PQ parallel ST, QR parallel PS, PT parallel QS, angle PQR=150^circ, PQ=4, QR=6, and ST = 18.

(2) At what price per kilogram should the supermarket set the selling price so that the profit from selling the rice reaches 1800? (3) At what price per kilogram should the selling price be set to maximize the daily profit? What is the maximum profit?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Function Relationship Between y and x Given the linear relationship between the quantity of rice sold per day y (in kilograms) and the selling price per kilogram x (in dollars), we can express this relationship as y = kx + b. We have two conditions: 1. When x = 5, y = 950. 2. When x = 6, y = 900. Plugging these conditions into the linear equation gives us two equations: - 5k + b = 950 - 6k + b = 900 Subtracting the second equation from the first gives: - (5k + b) - (6k + b) = 950 - 900 - -k = 50 - k = -50 Substituting k = -50 into 5k + b = 950: - 5(-50) + b = 950 - -250 + b = 950 - b = 1200 Therefore, the function relationship between y and x is y = -50x + 1200 for 4 leq x leq 7. Part 2: Selling Price for 1800 Profit Given the profit per kilogram is (x - 4) dollars and the quantity sold is y = -50x + 1200, the total profit equation is: - (x - 4)(-50x + 1200) = 1800 Expanding and solving for x: - -50x^2 + 1200x + 200x - 4800 = 1800 - -50x^2 + 1400x - 6600 = 0 - Dividing by -50: - x^2 - 28x + 132 = 0 Solving this quadratic equation, we find that x_1 = 22 (which we discard since it's outside the price range) and x_2 = 6. Therefore, the supermarket should set the selling price at boxed{6} dollars per kilogram to achieve a profit of 1800 per day. Part 3: Maximum Daily Profit The profit W is given by: - W = (x - 4)(-50x + 1200) - Simplifying, W = -50x^2 + 1400x - 4800 - Further simplification, W = -50(x^2 - 28x + 96) - Completing the square, W = -50(x - 14)^2 + 5000 Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative (-50), the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum value at the vertex. The vertex occurs at x = 14, but since the selling price must be between 4 and 7, we consider the maximum value within this range at x = 7. Substituting x = 7 into the profit equation: - W_{text{max}} = -50(7 - 14)^2 + 5000 - W_{text{max}} = -50(-7)^2 + 5000 - W_{text{max}} = -50(49) + 5000 - W_{text{max}} = -2450 + 5000 - W_{text{max}} = 2550 Therefore, to maximize the daily profit, the selling price should be set at boxed{7} dollars per kilogram, resulting in a maximum profit of boxed{2550} dollars."},{"prompt":"A man can row a boat at 9 kmph in still water.

Should the radius be increased or decreased to reduce the difference in the sums, while keeping the number of intersected squares constant?","completion":"To solve this problem, we have been given a situation where a circle of radius ( r = 1.9 ) units is drawn in the middle of an inner square on a chessboard with unit-length sides. We need to determine whether to increase or decrease the radius to balance the length of the arcs that fall on light and dark squares, while ensuring the number of such squares intersected remains unchanged. I. First Solution: 1. **Establish the Circle's Geometric Properties**: Select the center O of our circle to be the center of a light square. The circle intersects 16 squares, alternating between light and dark. 2. **Consider Symmetry**: By symmetry, any arc within one dark square can be mirrored to cover all similar such intersections, thanks to the chessboard's periodic structure. Thus, analyze one such intersection. 3. **Circle Segments and Distance Constraints**: The circle does not intersect adjacent dark squares because their farthest vertices from O would be at ( sqrt{1.5^2 + 0.5^2} = sqrt{2.5} < 1.6 < 1.9 ). However, the circle crosses into four nearby light squares and then into the adjacent dark squares, given the distance to the fourth vertex is ( sqrt{1.5^2 + 1.5^2} = sqrt{4.5} > 2 > 1.9 ). 4. **Angular Analysis**: Denote the entry and exit points in a dark square as A and B, and the angles ( alpha ) and ( beta ) that lines ( OA ) and ( OB ) make with the horizontal through O. Hence, the arc in the dark square subtends an angle ( beta - alpha ). Summing over all 8 dark arcs, their total central angle is ( 8(beta - alpha) ), implying the light arcs’ total angle is ( 360^circ - 8(beta - alpha) ). 5. **Comparing Angles**: To check ( beta - alpha ): [ cos beta = frac{1.5}{1.9} = 0.7895 quad text{(approximated)}, ] [ sin alpha = frac{0.5}{1.9} = 0.2632 quad text{(approximated)}. ] Taken frounding direction ensures smaller ( beta ) and larger ( alpha ), leading to: [ beta > 37^circ 51' quad text{and} quad alpha < 15^circ 16'. ] Therefore: [ beta - alpha > 37^circ 51' - 15^circ 16' = 22^circ 35'. ] 6. **Implication**: Since ( beta - alpha ) is greater than ( 22.5^circ ), the dark arcs (sums) are longer. To balance the lengths, decrease ( r ) so ( cos beta ) increases and ( beta ) decreases while ( sin alpha ) and ( alpha ) increase. Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Decrease } r} ] II. Second Solution: 1. **Find Critical Radius**: Use the angle requirement ( beta - alpha = 22^circ 30' ): [ sin (beta - alpha) = sin beta cos alpha - cos beta sin alpha = sin 22^circ 30' = sqrt{frac{1 - cos 45^circ}{2}} = sqrt{frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{4}}. ] 2. **Reformulate in Terms of ( r )**: Let ( sin alpha = frac{1}{2r} = z ). Then ( cos beta = 3z ), yielding: [ sqrt{1 - 9z^2} cdot sqrt{1 - z^2} - 3z^2 = sqrt{frac{2 - sqrt{2}}{4}}. ] 3. **Solve Quadratic Relationship**: Arriving at: [ 1 - 10z^2 = frac{2- sqrt{2}}{4} + 3sqrt{2 - sqrt{2}} z^2, ] results in: [ r^2 = frac{1}{2}(2 - sqrt{2})(10 + sqrt{18 - sqrt{162}}). ] 4. **Calculate and Validate**: Using tables or calculators and four significant digits: [ r = 1.898 ] showing ( r < 1.9 ).

Solving this inequality, we find frac {8}{5}leqslant y_{0}leqslant 2 Rightarrow 0leqslant x_{0}leqslant frac {6}{5}. Now let's enhance the solution with a more detailed explanation: 1. Consider a point P outside the circle O, and a moving point Q on the circle. The angle ∠OPQ reaches its maximum value when PQ is tangent to the circle. 2. If OP becomes longer, the maximum value that ∠OPQ can achieve becomes smaller. This is because sin ∠OPQ= frac {Q0}{PO}, and QO is a constant (the radius of the circle). As PO increases, sin ∠OPQ decreases, and consequently, ∠OPQ also decreases since ∠OPQ∈(0, frac {π}{2}). 3. When ∠OPQ=60^{circ} and PQ is tangent to the circle, we know that PO=2. Conversely, when PO > 2, no matter where Q moves on the circle, ∠OPQ < 60^{circ} always holds true. 4. Therefore, the range of P is POleqslant 2, meaning that as long as POleqslant 2, there will always exist a point Q such that ∠OPQ=60^{circ}. Otherwise, such a point Q would not exist. 5.

Also, let (omega) be the circle centered at (M) tangent to (AB) and (AC). 2. **Identify the Properties of (M):** (M) is the center of (omega), so (M) has equal distances to (AB) and (AC). 3. **Introduce the Point (D):** Redefine (D) as the reflection of (A) across the perpendicular bisector (l) of (BC). By the definition of a reflection, (D) lies on the perpendicular bisector (l). 4. **Establish Symmetry and Equal Tangents:** By symmetry, (omega) is centered on the line (l), hence tangents drawn from (B) and (C) to (omega) are symmetric with respect to (l). Therefore, (DB) and (DC) are tangents to (omega). 5. **Use Ptolemy's Theorem:** By Ptolemy's Theorem for the cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD), we have: [ AB cdot DC + AC cdot BD = AD cdot BC ] Since (DB) and (DC) are tangents from the same point (D) to the circle (omega), (DB = DC). 6. **Express (DC) and Substitute in Ptolemy's Theorem:** Let (DC = DB = x).

The pedal triangle of a point (P) with respect to a given triangle (ABC) is the triangle formed by the perpendiculars from (P) to the sides of (ABC). 3. **Circumcircle and Intersection**: Consider the circumcircles of the triangles (AB'C'), (BC'A'), and (CA'B'). For any arbitrary triangle (A'B'C'), these circumcircles intersect at a point (P). 4. **Projections and Pedal Triangle**: Let (A''), (B''), and (C'') be the projections of (P) on (BC), (CA), and (AB) respectively. Angles are crucial: [ angle A'PB' = angle A''PB'' = 180^circ - angle C ] This helps us establish that: [ angle A''PA' = angle B''PB' = angle C''PC' ] Thus, the triangle (A''B''C'') is obtained from (A'B'C') by a homothety (similarity transformation) with a coefficient less than 1, indicating (A''B''C'') is smaller. 5. **Optimal Point (T)**: Consider a point (T) for which the pedal triangle is equilateral and prove that for any other point (P) the pedal triangle's sides are longer.

Let's denote the vertices of a tetrahedron by ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ). 2. **Barycenter of the System:** Let ( O ) be the center of mass (centroid) of the entire tetrahedron. The centroid ( O ) of a system of masses positioned at the vertices ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) is given by the average of their coordinates if we assume coordinates. 3. **Centroid of Faces:** Let ( A_1 ) be the centroid of the face opposite vertex ( A ), which is the face formed by vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ). Similarly, let ( B_1, C_1, ) and ( D_1 ) be the centroids of the faces opposite vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ) respectively. 4. **Combined Masses Approach:** Consider the face opposite ( A ). The masses at vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ) can be thought of as combined at their centroid ( A_1 ). 5. **Finding the Overall Centroid:** Since the centroid ( A_1 ) is the average position of the unit masses at ( B, C, ) and ( D ), the tetrahedron's overall centroid ( O ) can be located by considering the weighted average of mass placed at ( A ) and the combined mass at ( A_1 ). This is done according to the principle of the lever (or weighted averages). 6. **Lever Rule Application:** Using the lever rule, we determine that centroid ( O ) lies on the segment ( AA_1 ) such that the ratio of ( AO ) to ( OA_1 ) is 3:1. Mathematically: [ AO = 3 times OA_1. ] 7. **Intersection of All Segments at O:** By symmetry and the definition of the centroid, repeating similar steps for the vertices ( B, C, ) and ( D ) implies that all four segments ( AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, ) and ( DD_1 ) intersect at the same point ( O ). 8. **Conclusion of Proof:** Therefore, the center of mass of the tetrahedron ( O ) lies on each of the segments connecting each vertex to the centroid of the opposite face. Additionally, each segment is divided by ( O ) in the ratio ( 3:1 ), counting from the respective vertex.

But we can calculate the expected value for each draw based on the initial probabilities. For the first marble, the probability of getting a marble of other colors is 0.4. Since the friend is taking five marbles, we can calculate the expected number of marbles of other colors for each draw and sum them up.

Our goal is to divide these numbers into groups such that the difference between any two numbers in each group is a prime number. 1. **Dividing Numbers Not Multiples of 5**: Let's denote the set of numbers not divisible by 5 from 1 to 2020 as ( S ). Hence, (|S| = 1616). 2. **Smallest Group Division**: To ensure that the differences between any two numbers in a group are always prime, we examine compositions of different group sizes. We start investigating the smallest groupings where this condition holds: - **Groups of 2**: - The pairs can be (odd, even), e.g., (1, 2). The difference (1 - 2 = 1) is not a prime number. This implies we cannot always satisfy the condition for every pair. - **Groups of 3 and 4**: - Consider the group ({1, 3, 6, 8}): - The differences are: [ begin{align*} 3 - 1 &= 2 quad (text{Prime}) 6 - 1 &= 5 quad (text{Prime}) 8 - 1 &= 7 quad (text{Prime}) 6 - 3 &= 3 quad (text{Prime}) 8 - 3 &= 5 quad (text{Prime}) 8 - 6 &= 2 quad (text{Prime}) end{align*} ] - This configuration shows that 4 numbers can be grouped while ensuring the differences are all prime numbers. 3. **Justifying Group of Four**: Suppose a group contains 5 numbers, i.e., ({A, B, C, D, E}). Express adjacent differences: [ begin{align*} X_1 &= B - A X_2 &= C - B X_3 &= D - C X_4 &= E - D end{align*} ] In the sequence (X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4), due to placement, at least one pair will sum to a composite number (sum greater than 2 and even), hence proving such grouping can't universally comply with the prime difference condition. 4. **Maximizing Group Sizes**: From 1 to 2020, where (404) groups are the numbers that are not multiples of 5, we can create groups: - The representatives could be ({1, 3, 6, 8}, {2, 4, 7, 9}, {11, 13, 16, 18} ) - Constructed sequentially.

This is a fundamental property of polygons that does not depend on the number of sides. Therefore, the statement that the sum increases with the number of sides is incorrect. Mathematically, for any polygon, if n is the number of sides, the sum of exterior angles is: [ sum text{Exterior Angles} = 360^{circ} ] This shows that the sum is constant and does not increase with n. **Statement B:** According to the exterior angle theorem in triangles, the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. This is a correct statement and a well-established theorem in geometry. For a triangle with interior angles A, B, and C, if D is an exterior angle adjacent to C, then: [ D = A + B ] This confirms the correctness of statement B. **Statement C:** In a right triangle, there are indeed three altitudes, but they do not all intersect at the right angle vertex. One altitude is the segment from the right angle vertex perpendicular to the hypotenuse, and the other two are the legs themselves, which are perpendicular to each other.

In March, the car salesman earned 2000. This includes his base salary (B) plus the commission from the cars he sold. Let's denote the number of cars he sold in March as C. So, the total earnings for March can be represented as: B + 200 * C = 2000 In April, he needs to sell 15 cars to double his March earnings. Doubling his March earnings would be 2000 * 2 = 4000. The earnings for April, including the base salary and commission from selling 15 cars, would be: B + 200 * 15 = 4000 Now we can solve for B using the equation for April's earnings: B + 200 * 15 = 4000 B + 3000 = 4000 B = 4000 - 3000 B = 1000 So, the base salary per month for the car salesman is boxed{1000} ."},{"prompt":"A lamp is put on one corner of a square plot of side 50 m. Its light reaches 21 m. What is the area of the plot that is lit by the lamp?","completion":"To determine the area of the plot that is lit by the lamp, we need to consider the shape of the lit area. Since the lamp is placed at the corner of the square plot, the lit area will be a quarter-circle with a radius equal to the distance the light reaches, which is 21 m. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. Since we only have a quarter-circle, we need to divide the area of the full circle by 4. So, the area of the lit portion of the plot is: A_lit = (π * r^2) / 4 A_lit = (π * 21^2) / 4 A_lit = (π * 441) / 4 A_lit = (441π) / 4 Now, we can calculate the numerical value: A_lit ≈ (441 * 3.14159) / 4 A_lit ≈ 1385.44259 / 4 A_lit ≈ 346.3606475 Therefore, the area of the plot that is lit by the lamp is approximately boxed{346.36} square meters."},{"prompt":"What is the domain of the function v(x) = frac{1}{x^2 + sqrt{x}}~?

For interval (T_n) and extra pieces A's and B's: - Move the 2 times 4 pieces using the initial steps of T_4: [ A , overrightarrow{A , A} , A(A , A , cdots , A , B , B , cdots , B) , B, B, B, B rightarrow A , square , square , A(A , A , cdots , A , B , B , cdots , B) , overleftarrow{B , B} , B , B , A, A rightarrow A , B , B , A(A , A , cdots , A , B , B , cdots , B) , square , square , B, B , A, A ] - We then perform n operations inside the interval (block): [ A , B , B , A , square , square , (B , A , B , A cdots B , A) , B , B , A, A rightarrow A , B(B , A cdots) rightarrow (alternating arrangement). ] 6. **Conclusion:** Following such structured operations, it can be concluded that the pieces are rearranged into a perfectly alternating sequence without any gaps. To conclude our proof, we rely on the prior steps ensuring that our operations efficiently realize the transition to the alternate arrangement satisfying the given condition.

For a step-by-step distribution: - If a wise man starts in car \`k neq 1\`, he checks car \`k+2\` for controllers and moves accordingly to car \`k+3\` or \`k+4\` if deemed safe. - In car 1: - If a controller is found in car 2, the wise man uses analogous moves as described above. - If a controller is in car 3 or unseen cars, subsequent steps determine the next safe car movement. For wise men in cars 3, 4, and so on: [ k = 1 Rightarrow text{Move to } k+3 text{ if k+2 is not safe} ] 5. **General Case During Controllers' Moves:** - Define active and passive controllers and ensure wise men continue to observe and move strategically. - If necessary, wise men wait for controllers to move and get to safe cars in the following turns. 6. **Conclusion:** - Ideally, we distribute wise men into different cars, ensuring no car has more than the safe number. - With the keen observation and appropriate moves, wise men can ensure the maximum uncaught number of them.

The sum of its digits is ( 1 + 8 = 9 ), and ( 18 div 9 = 2 ), so ( 18 ) is divisible by its sum of digits. - For ( n = 3 ), consider the number ( 189 ). The sum of its digits is ( 1 + 8 + 9 = 18 ), and ( 189 div 18 = 10.5 ), so we need a different example. Instead, consider ( 198 ). The sum of its digits is ( 1 + 9 + 8 = 18 ), and ( 198 div 18 = 11 ), so ( 198 ) is divisible by its sum of digits. 2. **General Case for Larger ( n ):** - For ( n leq 17 ), we can construct numbers where the sum of digits is a multiple of 9. For example, the number ( 111...111 ) (with ( n ) ones) has a sum of digits equal to ( n ). If ( n ) is a multiple of 9, then ( 111...111 ) is divisible by ( n ). If ( n ) is not a multiple of 9, we can adjust the digits slightly to make the sum a multiple of 9. - For ( n > 17 ), we can use the hint provided. For example, for ( n = 20 ), consider the number ( 33333444444444133312 ). The sum of its digits is ( 3 cdot 5 + 4 cdot 8 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 15 + 32 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 57 ). We need to ensure that the sum of digits is a divisor of the number. We can construct such numbers by ensuring the sum of digits is a power of 2 or 3 or a combination of these. 3. **Constructing the Number:** - For any ( n ), we can construct a number ( z ) such that its sum of digits is a divisor of ( z ). For example, for ( n = 20 ), the number ( 33333444444444133312 ) has a sum of digits ( 64 ), and ( 33333444444444133312 ) is divisible by ( 64 ). 4. **General Construction:** - For any ( n ), we can construct a number ( z ) by ensuring the sum of its digits is a divisor of ( z ). This can be done by choosing digits such that their sum is a power of 2 or 3 or a combination of these, ensuring divisibility. Therefore, for every positive integer ( n ), there exists an ( n )-digit number ( z ) with none of its digits being ( 0 ) and such that ( z ) is divisible by its sum of digits.

Recall that inversion with respect to a circle with center ( O ) and radius ( R ) maps a point ( A ) to a point ( A' ) such that ( OA cdot OA' = R^2 ). 3. **Analyze the result of the inversion**: - The circles that touch at point ( P ) are tangent to the inversion circle, which means they will map to each other under the inversion. - The original given circle will map to itself because it is orthogonal to the inversion circle at their points of tangency. Orthogonality in the context of circles under inversion preserves the circles' structure. 4. **Implications of the inversion**: - Since the original circle remains invariant and maps to itself, all the tangents from ( X ) to the original circle have the same length. - Hence, the distance ( XP ) equals the radius of the inversion circle and also equals the tangent segment from ( X ) to the given circle. 5. **Determine the locus of ( X )**: - Because ( X ) is a point from which equal-length tangents are drawn to the given circle, ( X ) must lie on the radical axis of point ( P ) and the given circle. The radical axis is the locus of points that have equal power with respect to the two circles defined by their radii and center distances. 6. **Conclusion**: Any point ( X ) satisfying the above properties must lie on the line known as the radical axis of the given circle and point ( P ). This is because this line represents points that have equal tangents' lengths to both the original circle and the inversion circle. Thus, the geometric locus of the points of intersection of the external tangents to these pairs of circles is the **radical axis of the point ( P ) and the given circle**.

To find out how much he spent on oranges, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent: 68 - 54.50 = 13.50 Since each orange costs 4.50, we divide the amount spent on oranges by the cost per orange to find out how many oranges he bought: 13.50 / 4.50 = 3 oranges Joe bought boxed{3} oranges."},{"prompt":"Find the polynomial ( q(x) ), with real coefficients, such that [ q(x^3) q(x^3 3) = [q(x)]^2 18 ] for all real numbers ( x ).","completion":"Let ( q(x) = b_m x^m + b_{m-1} x^{m-1} + cdots + b_1 x + b_0 ), where ( b_m neq 0 ).

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. First, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hour to m/s, since the length of the bridge is given in meters and the time is given in seconds. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/hour * (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 54 * (1000 / 1) * (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 54 * 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 54000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 15 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the total distance covered by the train while passing the bridge using the formula: Distance = Speed * Time The time taken to pass the bridge is given as 33.333333333333336 seconds.

By the definition of an ellipse, 2a = |QF_{1}| + |QF_{2}| = frac{7}{2} + frac{5}{2} = 6, thus a = 3, and since c = 1, we get b^{2} = a^{2} - c^{2} = 8, therefore the equation of the ellipse is frac{x^{2}}{9} + frac{y^{2}}{8} = 1. (II) Clearly, k neq 0, m neq 0. By eliminating x from the system begin{cases} y = kx + m y^{2} = 4x end{cases}, we get ky^{2} - 4y + 4m = 0, from the condition Delta = 16 - 16km = 0, we find km = 1, by eliminating y from the system begin{cases} y = kx + m frac{x^{2}}{9} + frac{y^{2}}{8} = 1 end{cases}, we get (9k^{2} + 8)x^{2} + 18kmx + 9m^{2} - 72 = 0, where Delta_{2} = (18km)^{2} - 4(9k^{2} + 8)(9m^{2} - 72) > 0, simplifying gives 9k^{2} - m^{2} + 8 > 0, since k = frac{1}{m}, we get m^{4} - 8m^{2} - 9 < 0, solving this gives 0 < m^{2} < 9, let A(x_{1}, y_{1}), B(x_{2}, y_{2}), then x_{0} = frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} = -frac{9}{9k^{2} + 8} < 0, since k^{2} = frac{1}{m^{2}} > frac{1}{9}, we get x_{0} > -1, therefore the range of values for x_{0} is boxed{(-1, 0)}."},{"prompt":"For what positive value of t is |{3+ti}| = 3sqrt{5}?","completion":"Given the complex number -3 + ti, we need to find the positive value of t such that its magnitude equals 3sqrt{5}. 1.

Given a rectangle (ABCD) with integral coordinates of its vertices on the coordinate plane and (O) as its center, we need to consider the angle (alpha) between its diagonals. 2. First, note that the angle (alpha) can be expressed as (alpha = angle COD) and (frac{alpha}{2} = angle CAD). Part (a) Determining if (cos alpha) is rational: 3. According to the properties of a rectangle, its diagonals are equal and bisect each other at the center (O). 4. By the definition of the cosine of an angle in a right triangle, we can examine the triangle formed by half-diagonals. Since (A) and (D) have integral coordinates, so do their midpoints. 5. The formula for the cosine of half the angle in a right triangle is: [ cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} = frac{(AD)^2}{(AC)^2} ] where (AD) and (AC) represent the length of the rectangle's sides. 6. Because (AD) and (AC) are integers (the distances between points with integer coordinates), ((AD)^2) and ((AC)^2) are rational. Hence, (cos^2 frac{alpha}{2}) is rational. 7. Using the double angle formula for cosine, we get: [ cos alpha = 2 cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} - 1 ] Since ( cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} ) is rational, ( cos alpha ) must also be rational. Part (b) Determining if (sin alpha) is rational: 8. Now, we consider the tangent of the angle (alpha). 9. Since (alpha) is the angle between lines with rational slopes (as the slopes of the diagonals of a rectangle with integral coordinates are rational), the tangent of the angle (alpha) is rational: [ tan alpha = frac{k_1 - k_2}{1 + k_1 k_2} ] where (k_1) and (k_2) are the slopes of the diagonals of the rectangle. 10. Recall the relationship between tangent and sine: [ sin alpha = cos alpha cdot tan alpha ] Since (cos alpha) is rational (from part (a)) and (tan alpha) is rational (by definition of slopes and angle relationships), the product (cos alpha cdot tan alpha) is also rational. # Conclusion: - (boxed{text{a) yes}}, cos alpha) is rational. - (boxed{text{b) yes}}, sin alpha) is rational."},{"prompt":"What is the smallest positive integer that has eight positive odd integer divisors and sixteen positive even integer divisors?","completion":"Let's analyze and solve this problem following the foundations laid out: 1. **Total number of divisors analysis**: Given that the number must have exactly 8 odd divisors and 16 even divisors, it implies the total number of divisors is 8 + 16 = 24. 2. **Factorization of divisors**: The number of divisors of a number n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2}...p_k^{e_k} is given by (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)...(e_k + 1). Thus, for n to have 24 divisors, potential factorizations in integers would include combinations that multiply to 24. Since 24 = 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 or 24 = 4 times 2 times 3, and so forth. 3. **Deduction based on even and odd divisors**: - **For odd divisors:** The odd divisor count discards any power of 2's effect. An odd number with exactly 8 divisors can be represented as p_1^7, p_1^3p_2, or p_1p_2p_3. - The smallest p_1^7 is 3^7 = 2187. - The smallest p_1^3p_2: 3^3 cdot 5 = 135. - The smallest p_1p_2p_3: 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 105. - **For even divisors:** Including the smallest power of 2 to get 16 even divisors while maintaining eight odd divisors means looking at n = 2^k cdot m where m is the smallest product having 8 odd divisors. Calculate k as 16 = (k + 1) times 8, so k = 1 because 2 times 8 = 16. Therefore, n = 2^1 cdot 105 = 210. 4. **Calculation and solution check**: Verify 105 = 3cdot 5cdot 7 gives 8 odd divisors, and multiplying by 2^1 gives total 24 divisors (8 odd, 16 even), matching our criteria.

This is because: - A positive slope (k > 0) ensures the line rises from left to right, allowing it to pass through the second and first quadrants. - A positive y-intercept (2-k > 0) ensures the line crosses the y-axis above the origin, which is necessary for it to extend into the second and third quadrants. 2. **Setting Up Inequalities:** Based on the above understanding, we set up the following conditions: - For a positive slope: k > 0. - For a positive y-intercept: 2-k > 0. 3. **Solving the Inequalities:** - The first condition directly gives us k > 0. - To solve the second condition, 2-k > 0, we rearrange it to find k < 2. 4. **Combining the Conditions:** Since k must satisfy both conditions simultaneously, we combine them to get the range of k: 0 < k < 2.

Recall from step 1 that sin α - cos α = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, so we can rewrite the denominator as frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(sin α + cos α) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(1), as sin α + cos α = 1 (add cos α to both sides of the equation in step 1). 5. Simplify the expression further: frac{cos^2 α - sin^2 α}{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(1)} = frac{2cos^2 α - 1}{sqrt{2}}. 6. Since we know sin α - cos α = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, square both sides to get sin^2 α - 2sin α cos α + cos^2 α = frac{1}{2}. Rearrange to get 2cos^2 α - 1 = -sin α cos α. 7.

For example, the permutation (1423) indicates: girl 1 has doll 1, girl 2 has doll 4, girl 3 has doll 2, and girl 4 has doll 3. 2. **Understanding Swaps (Transpositions):** - Each swap between a pair of girls is a transposition. - Starting with the identity permutation (12 ldots n), we make (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) transpositions. 3. **Parity of Permutations:** - If ( n equiv 2 pmod{4} ) or ( n equiv 3 pmod{4} ), then (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) is odd, which means the final result after the transpositions must be an odd permutation. - The identity permutation (12 ldots n) is even. - Therefore, ( n equiv 0 pmod{4} ) or ( n equiv 1 pmod{4} ) is a necessary condition for each girl to end up with her own doll. 4. **Proof for ( n equiv 0 pmod{4} ) and ( n equiv 1 pmod{4} ) being sufficient (Part 1):** - We first verify for small ( n ) using examples. - For ( n = 4 ): - Swaps: ( AB, CD, AC, BD, AD, BC ) - Positions: ( Ab Ba Cc Dd, Ab Ba Cd Dc, Ad Ba Cb Dc, Ad Bc Cb Da, Aa Bc Cb Dd, Aa Bb Cc Dd ) - This shows that ( n = 4 ) allows each girl to end up with her own doll. - Generalization shows we can construct swaps for ( n equiv 1 pmod{4} ). 5. **Induction Hypothesis:** - Suppose we have a solution for ( 4n ). - Add 4 girls ( A, B, C, D ), and use transpositions such as ( (A1)(B2)(A2)(B1) ) to effectively create smaller cycles within these 4 girls. - This leads to a solution for ( 4n + 4 ). 6. **Induction Step for ( n equiv 1 pmod{4} ):** - Suppose we have a solution for ( 4n + 1 ). - Adding 4 girls ( A, B, C, D ) and employing similar logic as above, using the solution for 5-girls can construct a path to the identity position for ( 4n + 5 ). 7. **Part 2: Case ( n = 3 ):** - It is impossible since it requires an even permutation, but the result of 3 transpositions (or any odd number) must be an odd permutation. 8. **Part 2: For all other ( n ):** - Constructing permutations systematically for other values. - For ( n ) even: [ (12), (13), ldots, (1n) text{ induces } n-1 rightarrow n, ldots, 2 rightarrow 1. ] - For ( n equiv 1 pmod{4} ): [ (1 n), (2 n), ldots, (n-1 n) text{ results in } n 1 2 ldots (n-1) ] 9. **Conclusion:** For ( (1) ) each girl ending with her own doll: [ boxed{n equiv 0 pmod{4} text{ or } n equiv 1 pmod{4}} ] For ( (2) ) each girl having another's doll: [ boxed{text{Possible for all } n text{ except for } n = 3} ]"},{"prompt":"Let ( a, b, c, d ) be distinct integers such that [ (xa)(xb)(xc)(xd) 4 = 0 ] has an integer root ( r ).

This means that if the altitudes have a certain ratio, the sides of the triangle will have the inverse of that ratio. Let's analyze each option step by step. **Option A: 1:1:2** Given the ratio of the altitudes is 1:1:2, the inverse ratio for the sides would be the reciprocal of these, which gives us the sides' ratio as 1/1:1/1:1/2 = 2:2:1. This satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 2:2:1 does exist. **Option B: 1:2:3** For the ratio of the altitudes 1:2:3, the inverse ratio for the sides would be 1/1:1/2:1/3 = 6:3:2 after finding a common denominator and taking the reciprocal. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for any two sides of a triangle, the sum must be greater than the third side. However, in this case, 3+2 is not greater than 6, which violates the triangle inequality theorem. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 6:3:2 cannot exist. **Option C: 2:3:4** Given the ratio of the altitudes as 2:3:4, the inverse ratio for the sides would be 1/2:1/3:1/4 = 6:4:3 after finding a common denominator and taking the reciprocal. This ratio satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, as 4+3 is greater than 6, 6+3 is greater than 4, and 6+4 is greater than 3. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 6:4:3 does exist. **Option D: 3:4:5** For the ratio of the altitudes 3:4:5, the inverse ratio for the sides would be 1/3:1/4:1/5 = 20:15:12 after finding a common denominator and taking the reciprocal. This ratio also satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, as 15+12 is greater than 20, 20+12 is greater than 15, and 20+15 is greater than 12. Therefore, a triangle with sides in the ratio 20:15:12 does exist. Based on the analysis above, the only option that does not satisfy the conditions for a triangle's sides is option B.

Combining these two steps, the total number of ways is binom{8}{2} times 3 = 28 times 3 = 84. However, we must consider that each student can be admitted by either one of the two universities or both. This doubles the number of ways for each student, leading to 2^3 = 8 possibilities for how the 3 students can be admitted by the 2 universities. Therefore, the final answer is 84 times 8 = 672. However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the calculation. The correct approach should be as follows: First, choose 2 universities from the 8, which can be done in binom{8}{2} = 28 ways. Then, since exactly 3 students are admitted by exactly these 2 universities, and each student must be admitted by one of the two (not both), there are 2^3 = 8 ways to assign the students to the two universities, considering each student has 2 choices (either of the two universities). Therefore, the correct calculation is binom{8}{2} times 2^3 = 28 times 8 = 224. Upon reviewing, the correct interpretation is that each of the 3 students has exactly 2 choices (either of the two selected universities), without the possibility of being admitted by both at the same time. Thus, the correct number of ways is indeed binom{8}{2} times 2^3 = 28 times 8.

We can check for divisibility by other small prime numbers such as 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. Let's check for divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 18887 is 1 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 32.

Similarly, the sum of the even-positioned terms is: [ a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + a_{10}. ] Since the even terms form an arithmetic sequence with the first term (a_2 = 2) and common difference (d_2), we can write: [ a_4 = a_2 + 2d_2 = 2 + 2d_2, ] [ a_6 = a_2 + 4d_2 = 2 + 4d_2, ] [ a_8 = a_2 + 6d_2 = 2 + 6d_2, ] [ a_{10} = a_2 + 8d_2 = 2 + 8d_2. ] Therefore, the sum of the even-positioned terms is: [ a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + a_{10} = 2 + (2 + 2d_2) + (2 + 4d_2) + (2 + 6d_2) + (2 + 8d_2). ] Simplifying, we get: [ 5a_2 + (2+4+6+8)d_2 = 5(2) + 20d_2 = 10 + 20d_2. ] 7. Combining the sums of the odd and even terms, we have: [ S_{10} = (5 + 20d_1) + (10 + 20d_2) = 75. ] 8. Simplifying the equation, we get: [ 15 + 20(d_1 + d_2) = 75. ] Subtracting 15 from both sides: [ 20(d_1 + d_2) = 60. ] Dividing by 20: [ d_1 + d_2 = 3. ] 9. Given that (a_n < a_{n+1}), consider the scenarios (n=2k-1) and (n=2k): For (n = 2k-1): [ a_1 + (k-1)d_1 < a_2 + (k-1)d_2. ] Simplifying: [ 1 + (k-1)d_1 < 2 + (k-1)d_2, ] [ (k-1)(d_1 - d_2) < 1. ] For (n = 2k): [ a_2 + (k-1)d_2 < a_1 + kd_1. ] Simplifying: [ 2 + (k-1)d_2 < 1 + kd_1, ] [ (k-1)(d_1 - d_2) > 1 - d_1. ] 10. For the inequalities ((k-1)(d_1 - d_2) < 1) and ((k-1)(d_1 - d_2) > 1 - d_1) to hold for any (k in mathbf{N}^{*}), [ d_1 = d_2. ] Substituting (d_1 = d_2 = 3). 11. Therefore, we have: [ d_1 = d_2 = 3. ] 12.

Consider the given polynomial: [ left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 + 1 ] 2. Assume that this polynomial can be factorized into the product of two polynomials with integer coefficients: [ left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 + 1 = p(x) q(x) ] where ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) are polynomials with integer coefficients. 3. At each ( x = a_i ) (where ( 1 le i le n )), the polynomial (left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2) evaluates to zero, thus: [ left(a_i - a_1right)^2 left(a_i - a_2right)^2 ldots left(a_i - a_nright)^2 + 1 = 1 ] 4. Since ( p(a_i) q(a_i) = 1 ) for all ( i ), each ( p(a_i) ) and ( q(a_i) ) must be either ( 1 ) or ( -1 ). 5. If there exists at least one ( p(a_i) = 1 ) and ( q(a_i) = -1 ) (or vice versa), then ( p(x) ) must change signs between these points as it moves from +1 to -1 or -1 to +1. This would imply that: [ p(x) text{ or } q(x) text{ should have a root between } a_i text{ and } a_j ] for ( a_i ne a_j ). However, this is not possible, since (left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 ge 0) and the sum with +1 ensures the polynomial is always greater than or equal to 1, never zero. 6. Thus, ( p(a_i) ) and ( q(a_i) ) must be consistently ( 1 ) or (-1) (either all 1's or all -1's) at each ( a_i ). 7. Let's assume: [ p(a_i) = 1 text{ and } q(a_i) = 1 text{ for all } i ] 8. Then the polynomials ( p(x) - 1 ) and ( q(x) - 1 ) must both have ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) as roots: [ p(x) - 1 = left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) ] and similarly for ( q(x) - 1 ). 9. Therefore: [ p(x) = left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) + 1 ] and [ q(x) = left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) + 1 ] 10. Multiplying these together, we get: [ p(x)q(x) = left[left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) + 1right]^2 ] [ p(x)q(x) = left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 + 2left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) + 1 ] 11. Compare this with the original polynomial: [ left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right)^2 ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 + 1 ] 12. The term ( 2left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) ) must be zero for the equality to hold. This implies: [ left(x - a_1right)left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright) equiv 0 ] which is impossible since ( x ) is a variable and ( a_i )'s are distinct non-zero integers. 13. Therefore, the assumption that ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) can have such values is false. 14. Similarly, (p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) cannot both be (-1 ) at each ( a_i ). 15. Thus, it is impossible to factorize: [ left(x - a_1right)^2 left(x - a_2right) ldots left(x - a_nright)^2 + 1 ] into products of two polynomials with integer coefficients.

For positive integers ( a, b, c ), we need to determine if there exists a positive integer ( m ) such that ( a-1 ), ( ab-12 ), and ( abc-2015 ) belong to ( P_m ). This translates to finding ( m ) such that: [ a-1 = m^x, quad ab-12 = m^y, quad abc-2015 = m^z ] for some non-negative integers ( x, y, z ). 2. **Analyze the divisibility conditions:** From the given conditions, we have: [ m^x + 1 mid m^y + 12 mid m^z + 2015 ] We need to analyze the implications of these divisibility conditions. 3. **Claim 1: At least one of ( x, y, z ) must be zero.** - **Proof:** Assume ( x, y, z > 0 ). Consider the numbers ( m^x + 1 ), ( m^y + 12 ), and ( m^z + 2015 ). - If ( m ) is odd, then ( m^x + 1 ) is even, ( m^y + 12 ) is odd, and ( m^z + 2015 ) is even. This contradicts the divisibility condition since an even number cannot divide an odd number. - If ( m ) is even, then ( m^x + 1 ) is odd, ( m^y + 12 ) is even, and ( m^z + 2015 ) is odd. This also contradicts the divisibility condition. Therefore, at least one of ( x, y, z ) must be zero. 4. **Claim 2: ( z = 0 ).** - **Proof:** - If ( y = 0 ), then ( m^x + 1 ) must be 1 or 13. This implies ( m = 12 ) and ( x = 1 ), but this would mean ( 13 = m^y + 12 ) which does not divide ( 12^z + 2015 ), leading to a contradiction. - If ( x = 0 ), then ( m^y + 12 ) must be even. Thus, ( m ) must be even (since ( y neq 0 )). This implies ( m^z + 2015 ) must be even, hence ( z = 0 ). Therefore, ( z = 0 ). 5. **Count the number of solutions:** - **Case 1: ( x = 0 ).** [ 2 mid m + 12 mid 2016 ] The number of even divisors of 2016 is the number of solutions. The prime factorization of 2016 is ( 2^5 cdot 3^2 cdot 7 ). The total number of divisors is ( (5+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 36 ). Half of these are even, so there are 18 even divisors. - **Case 2: ( x = 1 ).** [ m + 1 mid m + 12 implies m mid 11 ] This does not satisfy the problem's condition. - **Case 3: ( x > 1 ).** Since ( m ) must be even, ( m^x + 1 ) must be odd and thus divides 63.

The normal vectors of the given planes are: [ overrightarrow{n_{1}} = (6, -7, -1) ] [ overrightarrow{n_{2}} = (1, 7, -4) ] 4. We find the direction vector (vec{s}) using the cross product of (overrightarrow{n_{1}}) and (overrightarrow{n_{2}}): [ vec{s} = overrightarrow{n_{1}} times overrightarrow{n_{2}} = begin{vmatrix} mathbf{i} & mathbf{j} & mathbf{k} 6 & -7 & -1 1 & 7 & -4 end{vmatrix} ] 5. Compute the cross product: [ begin{aligned} vec{s} &= mathbf{i}left(-7 cdot -4 - (-1) cdot 7right) - mathbf{j}left(6 cdot -4 - (-1) cdot 1right) + mathbf{k}left(6 cdot 7 -(-7) cdot 1right) &= mathbf{i}(28 + 7) - mathbf{j}(-24 + 1) + mathbf{k}(42 + 7) &= 35mathbf{i} + 23mathbf{j} + 49mathbf{k} end{aligned} ] Thus: [ vec{s} = (35, 23, 49) ] 6. Next, we need to find a point on the line. Let (z_0 = 0). Then we solve for (x_0) and (y_0): [ begin{cases}{} 6x_0 - 7y_0 - 2 = 0 x_0 + 7y_0 - 5 = 0 end{cases} ] Solving the first equation for (x_0): [ x_0 = frac{7y_0 + 2}{6} ] Substitute (x_0) into the second equation: [ frac{7y_0 + 2}{6} + 7y_0 - 5 = 0 ] Multiply through by 6: [ 7y_0 + 2 + 42y_0 - 30 = 0 ] Combine like terms: [ 49y_0 - 28 = 0 ] [ 49y_0 = 28 ] [ y_0 = frac{28}{49} = frac{4}{7} ] Substitute (y_0) back to find (x_0): [ x_0 = frac{7 cdot frac{4}{7} + 2}{6} = frac{4 + 2}{6} = 1 ] 7. Therefore, the point ((x_0, y_0, z_0)) is: [ left(1, frac{4}{7}, 0right) ] 8.

This is derived from the fact that: (a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) geq 3(ab + bc + ca), since (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 geq ab + bc + ca) by the AM-GM inequality. 2. **Apply the obtained inequality**: Using the inequality above, we have: 1 + frac{3}{ab + bc + ca} geq 1 + frac{9}{(a + b + c)^2}. 3. **Simplify the right-hand side**: Next, we show that: 1 + frac{9}{(a + b + c)^2} geq frac{6}{a + b + c}.

This ensures that the interval (L-epsilon, L+epsilon) does not intersect [a, b]. 5. **Consequences of the epsilon-choice**: For this chosen epsilon, there exists an integer N such that for all n geq N, x_n in (L-epsilon, L+epsilon).

When a=-2e, the derivative f'(x) is: f'(x) = 2x - frac{2e}{x} = frac{2x^2 - 2e}{x} = frac{2(x^2 - e)}{x} To find the critical points, we set f'(x) = 0, which gives us x^2 - e = 0. The critical point is x = sqrt{e}. Analyzing the sign of f'(x), we observe that: - For 0 < x < sqrt{e}, the sign of f'(x) is negative, so f(x) is decreasing; - For x > sqrt{e}, the sign of f'(x) is positive, so f(x) is increasing. Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on the interval (0, sqrt{e}) and increasing on the interval (sqrt{e}, +infty).

The ratio of marbles distributed is 5:6:7:8:9:10:11:12:13. Let's add up all the parts of the ratio: 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 = 81 parts Let's denote the value of each part as \\"x.\\" This means that the first friend gets 5x marbles, the second friend gets 6x marbles, and so on, up to the ninth friend who gets 13x marbles. Since Zack has 27 marbles left after distributing them, we can express the total number of marbles he initially had as the sum of the marbles given away plus the 27 marbles left. The total number of marbles given away is 81x (since there are 81 parts in total). So the equation representing the total number of marbles initially is: Total marbles = 81x + 27 We don't know the exact number of marbles each friend received, but we do know that the number of marbles each friend received must be a whole number since you can't give away a fraction of a marble. Therefore, x must be a whole number. Since 27 is also a multiple of 9 (27 = 9 * 3), and there are 9 friends, it's likely that x is also a multiple of 9 to keep the distribution in whole numbers. Let's find the smallest possible value for x that is a multiple of 9. Since 27 is the smallest multiple of 9 greater than 0, let's try x = 3: Total marbles = 81x + 27 Total marbles = 81(3) + 27 Total marbles = 243 + 27 Total marbles = 270 So, if x = boxed{3,} Zack initially had 270 marbles. This satisfies the condition that each friend receives a whole number of marbles, and Zack has 27 marbles left after distribution. Therefore, Zack initially had 270 marbles."},{"prompt":"Can three circles have a single common point? Two common points? Three common points? Four common points?","completion":"# Problem: Can three circles have: 1. One common point? 2. Two common points? 3. Three common points? 4. Four common points? To answer this question, we need to analyze the geometric properties of circles and their intersections. 1. Can three circles have one common point? Yes, three circles can intersect at a single common point. This is because the intersection of circles does not necessarily have to be symmetrical, and it is possible for all three circles to pass through a single point in the plane. Example: Consider three circles centered at different points but all passing through a single common point. Let's denote the circles by (C_1, C_2,) and (C_3). If the equations of these circles are: - (C_1: (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = r_1^2) - (C_2: (x - c)^2 + (y - d)^2 = r_2^2) - (C_3: (x - e)^2 + (y - f)^2 = r_3^2) If these three circles intersect precisely at one point ((x_0, y_0)), then we have: - ((x_0 - a)^2 + (y_0 - b)^2 = r_1^2) - ((x_0 - c)^2 + (y_0 - d)^2 = r_2^2) - ((x_0 - e)^2 + (y_0 - f)^2 = r_3^2) 2. Can three circles have two common points? Yes, three circles can intersect at exactly two common points. For this to happen, the three circles must overlap at two distinct points. Example: Consider two circles (C_1) and (C_2) intersecting at two points. If a third circle (C_3) passes through both points of intersection, then all three circles intersect in two points. 3. Can three circles have three common points? No, three circles cannot have exactly three common points. To understand why this is impossible, we must analyze the locus of intersection points. Explanation: - If two circles intersect, they intersect at most in two points. - A third circle intersecting with these two will pass through at most two of these points but cannot create another independent intersection point that is common to all three. Thus, having exactly three common points is geometrically impossible. 4. Can three circles have four common points? No, three circles cannot have exactly four common points. To see this, consider the properties of circle intersections again: - Any two circles intersect at most in two points. - Thus, the number of points where all three circles intersect cannot exceed two. Therefore, the maximum number of common intersection points for three circles is two. # Conclusion: Based on the above analysis: 1. Three circles can intersect at one common point. 2. Three circles can intersect at two common points. 3. Three circles cannot intersect at three common points. 4. Three circles cannot intersect at four common points.

(2) Calculate sin frac{25pi}{6} + cos frac{26pi}{3} + tanleft(frac{25pi}{4}right).","completion":"(1) Since tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} = -frac{4}{3}, we can express sin alpha in terms of cos alpha as sin alpha = -frac{4}{3}cos alpha. Now, using the Pythagorean identity sin^2alpha + cos^2alpha = 1, we substitute sin alpha: left(-frac{4}{3}cos alpharight)^2 + cos^2alpha = frac{16}{9}cos^2alpha + cos^2alpha = frac{25}{9}cos^2alpha = 1, which simplifies to cos^2alpha = frac{9}{25}. Since alpha is in the fourth quadrant where cosine is positive, cos alpha = frac{3}{5}. Now, we can find sin alpha: sin alpha = -frac{4}{3}cos alpha = -frac{4}{3} times frac{3}{5} = -frac{4}{5}. Therefore, sin alpha = -frac{4}{5} and cos alpha = frac{3}{5}. (2) To calculate sin frac{25pi}{6} + cos frac{26pi}{3} + tanleft(-frac{25pi}{4}right), we use the properties of trigonometric functions to simplify the expression: sin frac{25pi}{6} can be simplified by subtracting multiples of 2pi to find an equivalent angle in the fundamental period: frac{25pi}{6} = 4pi + frac{pi}{6}. Since sin (2pi k + theta) = sin theta, we have sin frac{25pi}{6} = sin frac{pi}{6}. Similarly, cos frac{26pi}{3} can be simplified by subtracting multiples of 2pi: frac{26pi}{3} = 8pi + frac{2pi}{3}. Thus, cos frac{26pi}{3} = cos frac{2pi}{3}. Finally, for the tangent function, tanleft(-frac{25pi}{4}right) = -tan frac{25pi}{4} = -tan (6pi + frac{pi}{4}) = -tan frac{pi}{4} because tangent has a period of pi. Combining these results, the expression simplifies to: sin frac{25pi}{6} + cos frac{26pi}{3} + tanleft(-frac{25pi}{4}right) = sin frac{pi}{6} + cos frac{2pi}{3} - tan frac{pi}{4} = frac{1}{2} + left(-frac{1}{2}right) - 1 = -1.

For this to be a perfect square, (2 cdot 3^n + 1 equiv 2 cdot 3^n + 1 pmod{4}). Since (3 equiv -1 pmod{4}), we have (2 cdot (-1)^n + 1 equiv 2(-1)^n + 1 pmod{4}).

However, for (n > 2), (2^{3^{n-1}} > 3^n), which is not possible.

The p-adic valuation ( v_p(A_n) ) is the exponent of the prime ( p ) in the prime factorization of ( A_n ). We aim to show that ( v_p(A_n) ) is at least ( v_p(n!) ), where ( v_p(n!) ) is the p-adic valuation of ( n! ). 3. **Legendre's Formula**: Using Legendre's formula for the p-adic valuation of a factorial, we have: [ v_p(n!) = leftlfloor frac{n}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^3} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^4} rightrfloor + cdots ] Each term ( leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} rightrfloor ) represents the largest integer ( m ) such that ( p^k m leq n ), thus: [ leftlfloor frac{n}{p^k} rightrfloor leq frac{n}{p^k} ] Summing these terms: [ v_p(n!) leq frac{n}{p} + frac{n}{p^2} + frac{n}{p^3} + cdots = frac{n}{p-1} ] 4. **Evaluating ( v_p(A_n) )**: Consider ( A_n ): [ A_n = prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (2^n - 2^k) ] For ( p = 2 ): [ A_n = prod_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k (2^{n-k} - 1) ] Each term ( 2^k ) contributes to the 2-adic valuation.

The mid-perpendicular plane of the height from vertex (D) ((DD')) will be the reflection of the plane (ABC) about the center (O) of the circumscribed sphere.

We need to prove that all ( n ) points can be covered by a single circle of radius 1. 1. **Consider the smallest circle containing all the points:** Let ( R ) be the radius of the smallest circle that contains all ( n ) points. Gradually reduce the radius of this circle until it is no longer possible to reduce it further. This smallest circle will have radius ( R ) and will necessarily have at least two points on its boundary. 2. **Case 1: Exactly two points on the boundary:** Let's denote these two points on the boundary as ( A ) and ( B ). Clearly, ( A ) and ( B ) are diametrically opposite points of the circle. Consider a third point ( C ). The smallest circle that contains points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) must have a radius ( R ). Since ( R ) is the radius of this smallest circle and any three points can be covered by a circle of radius 1, we deduce that ( R leq 1 ). 3. **Case 2: Exactly three points on the boundary:** Now, consider the scenario where there are exactly three points ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) on the boundary of the smallest circle. In this case, the triangle ( triangle ABC ) must be acute-angled, because if it wasn't, we could decrease the radius of the circle containing ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). So, the minimal radius ( R ) of the circle containing ( A, B, ) and ( C ) must again be ( R leq 1 ). 4. **Case 3: At least four points on the boundary:** Suppose now there are four or more points on the boundary of the smallest circle. Let ( alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_n ) be the angular measures of consecutive arcs between these points. If the sum of the angular measures of any two consecutive arcs is no greater than ( 180^circ ), then their common point can be removed. Assume for contradiction that each pair of consecutive arcs ( alpha_i ) and ( alpha_{i+1} ) (considering ( alpha_{n+1} = alpha_1 )) sums to more than ( 180^circ ): [ alpha_1 + alpha_2 > 180^circ, alpha_2 + alpha_3 > 180^circ, ldots, alpha_n + alpha_1 > 180^circ ] Adding these inequalities, we obtain: [ 2 (alpha_1 + alpha_2 + ldots + alpha_n) > n cdot 180^circ ] Given that the total sum of angles around a circle is ( 360^circ ): [ 2 cdot 360^circ > n cdot 180^circ implies 720^circ > n cdot 180^circ implies 4 > n ] This is a contradiction since ( n geq 4 ). Thus, such ( alpha_i )’s cannot exist, therefore, there must be at least one pair of consecutive arcs with the sum of angular measures no greater than ( 180^circ ).

Congruence between two triangles means that they have exactly the same size and shape, which includes having corresponding sides of equal length. Therefore, two equilateral triangles with different side lengths are not congruent, even though they are similar in shape. For example, an equilateral triangle with side length 1 unit is not congruent to an equilateral triangle with side length 2 units because their sides are not of equal length.

Since O and O_1 are the centers of the inscribed and excircle respectively, we note that the hypotenuse BC is the common internal tangent to these two circles. The centers O and O_1 lie on the bisector of the right angle. 2. **Form Relationships** The distance from the vertices B and C to the bisector (where O and O_1 are located) provides the basis to determine further details: - The distance from a vertex to the incenter along the bisector is equal to the radius r of the inscribed circle. - The radius R of the excircle gives the distance from the vertex to the excircle center. 3. **Find Centers Coordination** Using the similarity of triangles OEK and O_1FK: [ frac{OE}{O_1F} = frac{OK}{KO_1} = frac{r}{R} ] Find K by proportioning OO_1 as r:R, where OK: KO_1 = r:R. 4. **Construct the Common Tangent (Hypotenuse)** With point K determined, the next step is to draw the tangent from K to one of the circles.

To calculate the smallest number of socks one must draw to ensure 15 pairs, consider the worst-case scenario: 1. **Worst-case Scenario**: To achieve at least 15 pairs of socks, we must consider drawing the maximum variety of socks without completing 15 pairs. 2. **Calculating the Limit**: Draw one sock of each type (5 socks total) plus additional socks to almost complete 15 pairs: - Taking 14 pairs of socks, we need ( 2 times 14 = 28 ) socks of a single color. - Once we have 28 socks of one color, picking any more socks of the same color will exceed the 14 pairs mark, so one will ensure 15 pairs. - Drawings from other colors can lead up to just below two socks of the 15th pair (14 pairs + 4 single socks). 3. **Avoiding Completing 15 Pairs**: Draw up to 4 additional socks that aren't of the color where we're about to get the 15th pair to maximize sock count before ensuring 15 pairs. Thus, ( 5 + 28 + 4 ). Therefore, to guarantee at least 15 pairs in the worst-case scenario, you would need ( 5 + 28 + 4 = 37 ) socks selected before you can ensure you'd cross into having 15 pairs.

The radius of the circular piece of paper will be the radius of the base of both cones and will remain unchanged. Let the radius of the paper (and the cones' base) be r.

Let's denote the number of ballpoint pens Vlad bought by ( x ) and the number of gel pens by ( y ). Let the price of each ballpoint pen be ( b ) and the price of each gel pen be ( g ). 2.

According to the problem, if all the pens were gel pens, the amount paid would be four times the actual amount: [ (x + y)g = 4T ] Substituting ( T ): [ (x + y)g = 4(xb + yg) ] 4. If all the pens were ballpoint pens, the amount paid would be half of the actual amount: [ (x + y)b = frac{1}{2}T ] Substituting ( T ): [ (x + y)b = frac{1}{2}(xb + yg) ] 5. Next, from the two equations obtained, let's solve for ( g ) in terms of ( b ). From: [ (x + y)g = 4(xb + yg) ] We can simplify this equation to: [ (x + y)g = 4xb + 4yg ] Subtracting ( (x+y)g ) from both sides: [ 0 = 4xb + 4yg - (x + y)g ] Simplifying further: [ 0 = 4xb + 3yg - xg ] Isolating ( xg ): [ xg = 4xb + 3yg ] Dividing the whole equation by ( x ): [ g = 4b + 3yg / xg ] 6. Now, let's solve the second equation: From: [ (x + y)b = frac{1}{2}(xb + yg) ] We can simplify this equation to: [ (x + y)b = frac{1}{2}xb + frac{1}{2}yg ] Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction: [ 2(x + y)b = xb + yg ] Subtracting ( xb ) from both sides: [ 2x b + 2y b - x b = yg ] Simplifying: [ x b + 2y b = yg ] 7.

According to the given information, P(A or B) is 18 times P(A and B), so we can write: P(A or B) = 18 * P(A and B) Substituting the expressions for P(A or B) and P(A and B), we get: P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B) = 18 * P(A) * P(B) Now, substitute P(A) = 2P(B) into the equation: 2P(B) + P(B) - (2P(B) * P(B)) = 18 * (2P(B) * P(B)) 3P(B) - 2P(B)^2 = 36P(B)^2 Move all terms to one side: 2P(B)^2 + 36P(B)^2 - 3P(B) = 0 Combine like terms: 38P(B)^2 - 3P(B) = 0 Factor out P(B): P(B)(38P(B) - 3) = 0 This gives us two possible solutions: P(B) = 0 or P(B) = 3/38. Since the probability that event A occurs is greater than 0, P(B) cannot be 0 (because P(A) is twice P(B), and if P(B) were 0, P(A) would also be 0). Therefore, we take the second solution: P(B) = 3/38 Now, we can find P(A) since P(A) is twice P(B): P(A) = 2 * (3/38) = 6/38 = 3/19 Therefore, the probability that event A occurs is boxed{3/19} ."},{"prompt":"Kelly puts string cheeses in her kids lunches 5 days per week.

Given: - 99 snowballs with masses ranging from 1 kg to 99 kg. - Three snowballs construct a snowman, where the mass of one ball must be at least half the mass of the one above it. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Constraints Analysis**: - Snowballs ranging from 50 kg to 99 kg: - If we take any two snowballs from this range, their mass does not allow them to be stacked on top of each other as the constraint specifies one must be at least half the other's mass. For example, 50 kg cannot be 1/2 of any mass in 51 to 99 kg. 2. **Concept of the Upper Bound**: - Since any two snowballs within the range 50 to 99 kg cannot be in the same snowman, there will always be at least two snowballs from the range 1 kg to 49 kg in each valid snowman. 3. **Numerical Calculation**: - Snowballs in range 50 kg to 99 kg are 50 in total. - Each snowman must have at least one snowball from the higher mass range (50-99 kg), thus the maximum number of snowmen will be limited by the number of such snowballs. - Each snowman needs to be paired with exactly 2 snowballs from the lower mass range (1-49 kg). 4. **Determination of Maximum Snowmen**: - Since the limiting factor is the number of snowballs from the 50 - 99 kg range, there can be at most: [ text{No. of snowmen} = 49 quad text{snowmen} ] 5. **Greedy Approach to Validate**: - We could try constructing a snowman with combinations like (96 kg, 48 kg, 24 kg) and then check for other combinations. - For example; [ 96 geq 2 times 48 quad text{(valid)} ] [ 48 geq 2 times 24 quad text{(valid)} ] 6. **Conclusion**: - Number of snowballs usable for 24 valid snowmen is supported by the upper bound considerations and combinatorial assembly.

A fixed point of a function ( f(x) ) is a point ( c in mathbf{R} ) such that ( f(c) = c ). Our task is to evaluate two statements about the fixed points of odd and even functions. Statement 1: **Theorem**: If ( f(x) ) is an odd function, the number of fixed points of ( f(x) ) is odd. 1. **Definition and Setup**: [ text{When } f(x) text{ is odd: } f(-x) = -f(x) ] Therefore, for ( x = 0 ): [ f(0) = -f(0) implies f(0) = 0 ] Thus, ( 0 ) is a fixed point of ( f(x) ). 2. **Nonzero Fixed Points**: Suppose ( c neq 0 ) is a fixed point of ( f(x) ).

We then differentiate F(x) with respect to x to find its derivative: [ F'(x) = frac{d}{dx}[f(x)e^{x}] = f'(x)e^{x} + f(x)e^{x} = [f'(x) + f(x)]e^{x} ] Given that f(x) + f'(x) = xln x, we substitute this into our expression for F'(x): [ F'(x) = xln x cdot e^{x} ] To analyze the behavior of F(x), we look for the critical points by setting F'(x) = 0: [ xln x cdot e^{x} = 0 ] This equation has a critical point at x = 1, since ln(1) = 0. This means that F(x) changes its behavior at x = 1. For x < 1, F'(x) < 0, indicating that F(x) is decreasing, and for x > 1, F'(x) > 0, indicating that F(x) is increasing. **For Option A:** Given 0 < frac{1}{e} < 1, F(x) is decreasing on this interval, so Fleft(frac{1}{e}right) > F(1). This translates to: [ fleft(frac{1}{e}right)e^{frac{1}{e}} > f(1)e ] Dividing both sides by e gives: [ fleft(frac{1}{e}right)e^{frac{1}{e}-1} > f(1) ] Therefore, Option A is correct. **For Option B:** Given e > 1, F(x) is increasing on this interval, so F(e) > F(1).

Differentiating h(x) with respect to x gives: [ h'(x) = F''(x) - F'(x) = (ln x + 1)e^{x} ] Setting h'(x) = 0 gives x = frac{1}{e}. This indicates that h(x) is decreasing for x < frac{1}{e} and increasing for x > frac{1}{e}. Since hleft(frac{1}{e}right) = 0, we conclude that F'(x) geq F(x) for all x in the domain, implying that f'(x) geq 0. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (0,+infty), making Option C correct. **For Option D:** From the analysis above, since f(x) is always increasing, it does not have a minimum value.

First, let's analyze the function g(x). We have: [g(x) = frac{4x}{x + 1} = 4 - frac{4}{x + 1}] This function is monotonically increasing on (-1, a) because the denominator x + 1 increases, making the fraction frac{4}{x + 1} decrease, and thus g(x) increases.

Now, let's consider two cases based on the value of a: 1. **Case 1: -1 < a < 1 + sqrt{2}** In this range, f(x) < f(1) = 1 for x in (-1, a). Since there must exist x_2 in (-1, a) such that f(x_1) leq g(x_2), we get: [1 leq frac{4a}{a + 1}] Solving this inequality for a gives: [a geq frac{1}{3}] Thus, in this case, the range of a is frac{1}{3} leq a < 1 + sqrt{2}. 2. **Case 2: a geq 1 + sqrt{2}** Here, f(x) < f(a) = a^2 - 2a for x in (-1, a).

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2), we obtain (a_{n+2}^2 - a_{n+1}^2) + 2(a_{n+2} - a_{n+1}) = a_{n+1} - a_n, which simplifies to (a_{n+2} - a_{n+1})(a_{n+2} + a_{n+1} + 2) = a_{n+1} - a_n. Since a_n > 0, (a_{n+2} - a_{n+1}) and (a_{n+1} - a_n) have the same sign. As (a_2 + 1)^2 = a_1 + 3 = 5, we have a_2 = sqrt{5} - 1, and (a_2 - a_1) = sqrt{5} - 3 < 0. Thus, a_{n+1} - a_n < 0, which means the sequence {a_n} is strictly decreasing. (II) From a_{n+1}^2 + 2a_{n+1} = a_n + 2, we get (a_{n+1} + 3)(a_{n+1} - 1) = a_n - 1. This implies that |a_{n+1} - 1| = frac{|a_n - 1|}{a_{n+1} + 3}. Since (a_{n+1} + 3)(a_{n+1} - 1) = a_n - 1, it is evident that (a_{n+1} - 1) and (a_n - 1) have the same sign. Given that a_1 - 1 = 1 > 0, we have a_n - 1 > 0, which means a_n > 1. As a result, (a_{n+1} + 3) > 4, and frac{1}{a_{n+1} + 3} < frac{1}{4}. Thus, |a_{n+1} - 1| < frac{1}{4} |a_n - 1|.

If (O) is projected onto a line (L_i), the result is a point (P_i) on (L_i). 2. **Subsequent Projections**: Each subsequent projection follows the same process; for a point already on one of the lines, its projection onto another line follows the orthogonal projection rule. 3. **Geometric Considerations**: Given (n) lines are pairwise non-parallel, they span a three-dimensional space. Therefore, the process of repeated projections spans points in three dimensions. 4. **Sphere Existence Proof**: We need to prove that all these projections are contained within a sphere centered at (O). - **Distance Bound**: For each point (P_i) obtained from a projection, it lies on the line (L_i), which means its distance to (O) can be controlled. Since each (L_i) is non-parallel and there are only finitely many lines, all points (P_i) lie within a bounded distance from (O). - **Covering all Projections**: A projection onto any line will bring the point closer to (O), or lie within a fixed distance from (O). As there are fixed criteria and a finite number of lines, every projection is within a fixed, finite distance from (O). 5. **Conclusion**: If the set of initial points obtained by projecting (O) onto the (n) lines is finite and each projection after that is bounded within a distance from (O), a sphere centered at (O) containing all these points can be found.

For the given parabola, which opens upwards, the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is y + dfrac{p}{2}, where p is the focal distance. To solve the problem, let's designate the points of intersection as A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}). By solving the simultaneous equations of the line and the parabola, we obtain the quadratic equation 3y^{2}-10y+3=0. Solving this equation, we find y_{1}=3 and y_{2}=dfrac{1}{3}, with y_{1} > y_{2}. Since |AF| > |BF|, this means point A is farther from the focus than point B. Therefore, A corresponds to y_1 and B to y_2. Using the definition of a distance to the focus of a parabola, we can write the ratio of the distances as follows: begin{equation} dfrac{|AF|}{|BF|} = dfrac{y_{1}+dfrac{p}{2}}{y_{2}+dfrac{p}{2}} end{equation} Given that the parabola's equation is x^{2}=4y, we see that 4y represents 4p, where p=1.

Since ( P ) is inside the square, the sum of these areas is equal to the area of the square, which we can normalize to 1 for simplicity: [ A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 = 1 ] 2. **Identify the largest and smallest areas:** Without loss of generality, assume ( A_1 geq A_2 geq A_3 geq A_4 ).

The golden ratio ( phi ) is given by: [ phi = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ] This ratio arises because it is the most balanced way to divide the square into triangles such that the ratio of the largest to the smallest area is minimized. 6. **Verify the golden ratio:** If we assume ( frac{A_1}{A_4} = phi ), then: [ frac{A_1}{A_4} = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ] This ensures that the ratio of the largest to the smallest area is within the interval (left[frac{1}{phi}, phiright]).

This property indicates that the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (2,0). Therefore, we can immediately conclude that option B is correct. 2. **Rearranging the given properties:** Given f(2+x)=-f(2-x), we can rearrange this to express -f(-x) in terms of f(4+x), yielding -f(-x)=f(4+x). Additionally, from the property f(3+x)=f(3-x), we can rearrange to find f(x)=f(6+x). This implies that f(6+x)=-f(4+x), which can be further rearranged to show that f(x+2)=-f(x).

Let's denote their coordinates as C(x_{1}, x_{1}^{2}) and D(x_{2}, x_{2}^{2}). Assuming x_{1} < x_{2} for simplicity. Given that CD is parallel to AB and both lie on lines with slopes, we can equate the slopes of these lines. For the line AB which lies on y=2x-17, the slope is 2. The slope of the line through C and D can be found using the derivative of y=x^2, which gives 2x at any point x.

Specifically, any box that originally contained ( n_1 ) cakes will be empty and thus not contribute any more cakes for Seryozha to record. 4. **Consider the next number ( n_2 ):** For the remaining boxes (those that initially contained more than ( n_1 ) cakes), the new smallest number of cakes in any box is more than ( n_1 ). The exact count of these boxes is given by ( N_2 ), where: [ N_2 = text{number of boxes with originally more than } n_1 text{ cakes} ] This number ( N_2 ) will be recorded ( n_2 ) times by Seryozha. 5. **Continue with subsequent rounds:** Repeating this argument, ( n_3, n_4, ldots, n_k ): - Each of these numbers will be similarly taken out of the boxes. - Each ( n_i ) corresponds to the count of boxes that originally had more than ( n_{i-1} ) but not more than ( n_i ) cakes, ensuring that each distinct number of cakes recorded by Alyosha appears exactly once as the count of boxes recorded by Seryozha. 6. **Conclude the equality:** Given that every ( n_i ) count of cakes is systematically removed and recorded by Seryozha in sequence, the distinct numbers recorded by both Alyosha and Seryozha remain equivalent in their unique preparations. # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the number of distinct numbers recorded by Alyosha is equal to the number of distinct numbers recorded by Seryozha.

Prove that your answer is correct.","completion":"To determine the maximum number of diagonals that can be drawn in a convex n-gon such that each diagonal intersects every other one strictly in the interior, follow these steps: 1. **Case Analysis for Even n:** - If ( n ) is even, say ( n = 2k ), consider drawing diagonals from each vertex to the vertex ( k ) vertices away. - For each vertex ( v_i ), the diagonal ( v_iv_{i+k} ) will be drawn. - Since these diagonals are evenly spaced around the ( n )-gon, each diagonal will intersect every other diagonal exactly once in the interior of the polygon. - The number of such diagonals is exactly ( frac{n}{2} = k ). 2. **Example for Even ( n = 6 ):** - In a hexagon (( n = 6 )): - Connect vertex 1 to vertex 4, - Connect vertex 2 to vertex 5, - Connect vertex 3 to vertex 6. - Each of these 3 diagonals intersect exactly once with each of the others. 3. **Case Analysis for Odd ( n ):** - If ( n ) is odd, say ( n = 2k + 1 ), we can effectively remove one vertex to create a ( (2k) )-gon and apply the even case result. - This results in ( k ) diagonals being drawn in the ( (2k+1) )-gon. - Like the even case, each of these diagonals will intersect every other one strictly in the interior. 4. **Example for Odd ( n = 7 ):** - In a heptagon (( n = 7 )): - Pretend vertex 7 doesn't exist and consider the remaining 6 vertices as forming a hexagon. - Draw 3 diagonals as described in the even case for the hexagon. - These 3 diagonals will intersect every other one strictly in the interior. 5. **Proof of Optimality:** - Consider any given diagonal partitioning the ( n )-gon into two parts. The two parts will have ( n-2 ) vertices remaining. - One part must have at most ( lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor - 1 ) vertices. - It's impossible to draw more than ( lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor ) such diagonals intersecting all others strictly in the interior, as any additional diagonal would not have enough distinct vertices remaining to intersect all others in the required manner without sharing endpoints. 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, the maximum number of diagonals that can be drawn in a convex ( n )-gon, ( n geq 4 ), such that each diagonal intersects every other strictly in the interior, is ( lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor ).

Substituting b = 1 and c = 1 gives a^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2, so a = sqrt{2}. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is: frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1.

Given M(0,1) and F(1,0), and knowing that F is the orthocenter, we deduce that the slope of PQ must be 1 (since one of the altitudes in an isosceles right triangle is along the line y = x). - The equation of line l can be written as y = x + m.

We will apply Pascal's Theorem to our configuration: - Consider points A, M, N, D, C, B which lie on the circle S. - Pascal's Theorem states that the intersection points of the extensions of (AM cap DC), (MN cap CB), and (ND cap AB) should be collinear. 5. **Verify the intersections**: - The intersection of AM and DC is point E. - The intersection of ND and AB is point F. - The intersection of MN and BC is point K, which we need to find. 6. **Conclude using Pascal's theorem**: According to Pascal's theorem, since A, M, N, D, C, B lie on a circle, the points E, K, and F are collinear.
