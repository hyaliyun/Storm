Esta idea se refleja a través de la violencia, y se mencionó que la masculinidad es la forma aceptada de ser un hombre adulto en la sociedad. Se estableció que la masculinidad se construye a través de la diferenciación y la identificación. En la diferenciación, el niño aprende a ser diferente de su madre y adopta características de la masculinidad como el dominio y la rudeza. En la identificación, el niño se identifica con el modelo masculino y se aleja de la conducta de su madre, como la sensibilidad y la delicadeza. El autor también mencionó que el género es una forma de ordenar la práctica social, y esto se refleja en la violencia intrafamiliar, donde el hombre asume el poder y el control sobre la mujer a través de la violencia. Se señaló que en nuestra cultura se enseña a los hombres a ser fuertes y reprimir sus emociones, lo que lleva a comportamientos agresivos hacia las mujeres en la adultez. Se discutieron las expectativas de la masculinidad y cómo los hombres violentos las manejan en distintos espacios. Se mencionó que el espacio intelectual es importante para la masculinidad, y que los hombres violentos se ven a sí mismos como superiores y rechazan cualquier punto de vista que desafíe su pensamiento. También se habló del espacio físico, donde los hombres comparan su fuerza con la de las mujeres, y del espacio emocional, donde los hombres reprimen sus emociones y confunden el afecto con las expectativas sociales y culturales. En el espacio social, se mencionó que los hombres buscan probar su superioridad a través de la competencia con otros hombres y también con su pareja. Se destacó que los hombres violentos controlan los contactos sociales de su pareja. Por último, en el espacio cultural se señaló que las diferentes culturas y grupos sociales influyen en su comportamiento. Para finalizar, las causas de la violencia del hombre en el hogar están relacionadas con su creencia de superioridad sobre su pareja y la necesidad de mantener el control a través de la violencia. Esta mentalidad se ha normalizado en nuestra sociedad, donde se espera que el hombre sea dominante y controle a su mujer. Además, la diferenciación de roles y actividades por género puede generar una crisis en el hombre cuando se le exige igualdad, ya que siente que su superioridad está en peligro. Para detener la violencia, es necesario que el hombre acepte la igualdad de su pareja y se aleje de la identidad machista, reconociéndola y apoyándola de manera equitativa. Competencias: Esta información proporciona a la estudiante de trabajo social una comprensión profunda de cómo la masculinidad y la violencia están relacionadas. Le permite analizar cómo el machismo y el patriarcado perpetúan la idea de superioridad masculina y cómo esto se manifiesta a través de la violencia de género. La estudiante también puede entender cómo se construye la masculinidad a través de la diferenciación y la identificación, así como la importancia de los diferentes espacios (intelectual, físico, emocional, social y cultural) en la expresión y afirmación de la masculinidad. Esta información le brinda a la estudiante una base sólida para comprender las dinámicas familiares.","completion":"Para aplicar las competencias 3 y 6 en la práctica, la estudiante de trabajo social puede: 1.

Если элемент является конечным числом, он остается неизменным (\`x\`), в противном случае он заменяется на значение \`NA\`. 3. \`rbind(...)\` объединяет результаты и возвращает новый датафрейм, в котором столбцы имеют одинаковую длину. Это делается с помощью функции \`do.call()\`, которая применяет \`rbind()\` к списку результатов, полученных в результате применения функции \`lapply()\` к каждому столбцу датафрейма \`df\`. 4.

Если столбец содержит числовые значения или факторы: \`\`\`R unique_values <- unique(dfcolumn_name) \`\`\` или \`\`\`R unique_values <- levels(dfcolumn_name) \`\`\` где \`df\` - имя вашей таблицы, а \`column_name\` - имя столбца, в котором вы хотите найти уникальные значения.

Ramírez Hernández, páginas 25-36. A continuación, se provee el resumen, en la lectura se exploró la conexión entre la masculinidad y la violencia, donde se señaló que el machismo es el producto del patriarcado y perpetúa la idea de que el hombre es superior, tiene el poder y control sobre las mujeres. Esta idea se refleja a través de la violencia, y se mencionó que la masculinidad es la forma aceptada de ser un hombre adulto en la sociedad. Se estableció que la masculinidad se construye a través de la diferenciación y la identificación. En la diferenciación, el niño aprende a ser diferente de su madre y adopta características de la masculinidad como el dominio y la rudeza. En la identificación, el niño se identifica con el modelo masculino y se aleja de la conducta de su madre, como la sensibilidad y la delicadeza. El autor también mencionó que el género es una forma de ordenar la práctica social, y esto se refleja en la violencia intrafamiliar, donde el hombre asume el poder y el control sobre la mujer a través de la violencia. Se señaló que en nuestra cultura se enseña a los hombres a ser fuertes y reprimir sus emociones, lo que lleva a comportamientos agresivos hacia las mujeres en la adultez. Se discutieron las expectativas de la masculinidad y cómo los hombres violentos las manejan en distintos espacios. Se mencionó que el espacio intelectual es importante para la masculinidad, y que los hombres violentos se ven a sí mismos como superiores y rechazan cualquier punto de vista que desafíe su pensamiento. También se habló del espacio físico, donde los hombres comparan su fuerza con la de las mujeres, y del espacio emocional, donde los hombres reprimen sus emociones y confunden el afecto con las expectativas sociales y culturales. En el espacio social, se mencionó que los hombres buscan probar su superioridad a través de la competencia con otros hombres y también con su pareja. Se destacó que los hombres violentos controlan los contactos sociales de su pareja. Por último, en el espacio cultural se señaló que las diferentes culturas y grupos sociales influyen en su comportamiento. Para finalizar, las causas de la violencia del hombre en el hogar están relacionadas con su creencia de superioridad sobre su pareja y la necesidad de mantener el control a través de la violencia. Esta mentalidad se ha normalizado en nuestra sociedad, donde se espera que el hombre sea dominante y controle a su mujer.

The operation aimed to lure and destroy North Vietnamese fighter aircraft, which had been posing a significant threat to US air superiority in the region. Robin Olds was a highly decorated USAF fighter pilot who played a crucial role in Operation BOLO. At the time, he was a colonel and commanded the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing based at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base in Thailand. Olds devised a plan to deceive and trap the North Vietnamese flying aces, specifically the MiGs. He realized that the North Vietnamese MiG pilots had a pattern of behavior. They would often fly low-level strafing missions against US targets before quickly retreating to their protected airfields. Olds decided to exploit this behavior by simulating one of these strafing missions with USAF F-4 Phantom II fighter-bombers, while using F-4s equipped with radar homing and warning (RHAW) systems as a decoy. On January 2, 1967, Olds executed his plan during Operation BOLO. The F-4s equipped with RHAW flew in patterns simulating the behavior of vulnerable fighter-bombers, hoping to attract and engage the North Vietnamese MiG pilots. Meanwhile, Olds, leading a flight of F-4s armed with air-to-air missiles, positioned his aircraft at higher altitude and prepared to ambush the enemy fighters. The ruse worked, and seven North Vietnamese MiG-21 fighters took the bait, believing they were intercepting the F-4 fighter-bombers. However, they were met by Olds and his flight of F-4s, who maneuvered into an advantageous position and successfully shot down all seven MiGs. Operation BOLO turned out to be a major success, as it resulted in the highest number of MiG kills by the USAF in a single day during the Vietnam War. The operation significantly reduced the threat posed by North Vietnamese fighter aircraft and boosted the morale of American pilots. Robin Olds' leadership, innovative thinking, and a thorough understanding of the enemy tactics played a crucial role in the success of Operation BOLO. His strategic planning and execution helped ensure the safety of US forces and further established him as one of the most renowned American fighter pilots of the Vietnam War."},{"prompt":"我要一份述职报告PPT","completion":"创建一份述职报告PPT（PowerPoint演示文稿）是为了向上级或评审团展示你的职责、成就、挑战和未来计划。我无法直接提供一个现成的PPT文件，但我可以为你提供制作述职报告PPT的结构和主要内容，你可以按照这些建议去创建自己的演示文稿。 以下是制作述职报告PPT的基本步骤和建议内容： # 第一步：准备工作 - 确定你的听众是谁（上级领导、同事、团队成员等）。 - 理解听众的期望和关注点（项目进度、解决问题的能力等）。 - 收集你想要展示的数据、证据和案例。 # 第二步：PPT结构 1. 封面页 - 标题（如：2023年某某职位述职报告） - 呈现者姓名 - 日期 - 公司/部门标识 2. 目录页（可选） - 快速概览将要讨论的主题 3. 个人简介页 - 姓名和职位 - 简短的背景介绍，例如教育、工作经验 - 主要职责 4. 工作成就 - 过去一年（或相关时间段）你取得的重要成就 - 可以用数据和图表支撑你的成果 - 特殊贡献和获得的奖励或表彰 5. 面临的挑战 - 遇到的主要难题和挑战（项目困难、资源限制等） - 如何应对挑战、解决问题的思路和做法 6. 个人成长 - 这段时间你在技能或者职业素养上的提升 - 参加的培训、研讨会、认证等 7. 未来计划 - 针对未来一个阶段的工作目标和计划 - 个人职业发展的规划 8. 结论和总结 - 简短回顾一下你的述职内容 - 凸显你对于未来的信心和准备 9. 感谢与提问 - 感谢听众的时间和注意 - 邀请提问和反馈 # 第三步：设计建议 - 保持页面简洁，不要过多使用文字。 - 使用图表、图像和弹性布局可以帮助解释和辅助你的阐述。 - 统一的配色方案和格式可以让PPT看起来更加专业。 - 尽量使用清晰的字体和足够大的字号，确保观众能够阅读。 - 排练你的演讲稿，以免在实际演示中太过依赖PPT页面上的内容。 创建PPT时，你可以使用Microsoft PowerPoint或者其他软件，如Google Slides或者Keynote等，这些都是常见的演示文稿软件。 记住，在演讲中，你的口头表达同样重要。即使PPT内容完备，良好的表达和沟通能力也是影响演讲效果的关键因素。确保你能够流畅地介绍每张幻灯片，并准备好回答可能的问题。"},{"prompt":".

PQ has been found to exhibit neurodevelopmental toxicity and can affect the outcome of neural stem cells (NSCs) in term of proliferation and differentiation. However, there have been few studies conducted on the effects of PQ on NSC metabolism. Herein, we analyzed the intracellular and extracellular metabolic changes of murine neural stem cells (mNSCs) under PQ exposure and the potential mechanism involved. The mNSCs located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of newborn mice were treated with PQ concentrations of 0, 10, 20 and 40 μM for 24h, and the metabolites were detected using untargeted metabolomics coupled with UPLC-MS. We identified 130 intracellular differential metabolites (DMs) and 50 extracellular DMs, and mainly screened enriched metabolic pathways that included phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, arginine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism. Furthermore,, we established dose-response fitting models and calculated effective concentrations (ECs) for metabolites. Our results suggest that arginine metabolism, phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, and pyrimidine metabolism may be sensitive metabolic pathways that are altered by PQ in mNSCs. In addition, putrescine, L-arginine, ornithine, L-histidine, N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine, and thymidine may serve as potential biomarkers for characterizing early damage to mNSCs caused by low-dose PQ exposure. We also found correlations between dysregulated DMs and altered proliferation, differentiation, and migration outcomes of mNSCs. The potential mechanism of PQ toxicity may be associated with oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell cycle dysregulation.

En el caso de la liberación prolongada, el fármaco está diseñado para liberarse lentamente en el organismo durante un período de tiempo prolongado. Esto permite que se mantengan niveles constantes del fármaco en la sangre a lo largo del día, lo que puede ser beneficioso en el caso de enfermedades crónicas o en el manejo de síntomas a largo plazo. Este tipo de liberación puede ser lograda mediante formulaciones especiales, como cápsulas de liberación prolongada o parches transdérmicos, que están diseñados para disolver o desprender el fármaco gradualmente. Por otro lado, la liberación controlada de un fármaco implica que el medicamento se libera a una velocidad específica y controlada en el cuerpo. Esto implica el uso de sistemas de liberación diseñados para regular la velocidad a la que el fármaco se disuelve o se desprende. La liberación controlada puede ser particularmente útil cuando se necesita administrar un fármaco en dosis precisas y mantener niveles constantes en el tiempo. Este enfoque puede ser utilizado en situaciones como terapias hormonales o en el caso de fármacos que tienen una ventana terapéutica estrecha (es decir, en la que se requiere una concentración específica en el cuerpo para ser efectiva sin generar toxicidad).

Inspired by the miracle, their hearts aglow, They dedicated their lives, His love to show. With beards all white and hats so red, They spread joy and cheer, where'er they tread. Tiny hands crafting gifts, with tender care, To share the love of Jesus, beyond compare. They built tiny sleds, and tied bows so bright, To deliver precious presents throughout the night. Not for themselves, but for those in need, To fill empty hearts with love, let them be freed. Galloping through meadows, o'er hills and streams, These gnomes carried a message, like starlight beams. They sang with joy, in their high-pitched voice, Of baby Jesus, born, making hearts rejoice. With each gift, a note, they did impart, Telling of God's love, filling every heart. From the tallest pines, to the humblest homes, The gnomes spread the message, where'er they roamed. No matter the faith or creed, near or far, The spirit of Christmas they'd bring, like a shining star. For in their small forms, a great love did reside, A love that couldn't be contained, nor ever denied.

The Famine Devil is mentioned in Chapter 84 in Makima's plan to reshape the world by erasing devils. She appears for the first time in Chapter 108, and Yoru namedrops her as the Famine Devil in Chapter 118, warning Asa to stay away from her.)The other ones are the Death Devil, Control Devil, and War Devil. She is female, as are the other three. She possesses greyish Mountbatten pink hair which reaches her shoulders as well as eyes with unusual irises. They are colored burgundy, and black outlines among the burgundy create a concentric pattern. She calls herself Kiga-chan, or Fami in the English translation (Note: Kiga is Japanese for Famine). She shows very little outward emotion. She is always calm, cold, and composed, even when enjoying delicious food, something she is utterly obsessed with. It isn't just quality she favors either. She's a complete glutton with a taste for human food, and her appetite is beyond imagination. Now, in the story I am writing, she'll come across a certain new restaurant that specializes in creating cheesy delicacies, of both the sweet and savory varieties. The owner? Well, technically independent backers, but it's run by a student at Fourth East High School named Norman (Norm) Slater. He's the president of its cooking club, which he founded as a freshman with friends Yasuo Serizawa, Seishiro Hanamura, and Nami Maebara. He showed them the beauty of cheese, although it isn't a staple of the Japanese diet, and it quickly became a novelty. Nami died in a devil attack weeks before the restaurant could finally be opened. The Cheesy Spoon has one rule - if it's got cheese, it can be made. From the classic grilled cheese to the succulent baked brie pastry, or delicious cannolis, or even pancakes positioned as giant cannolis, stuffed with sweetened ricotta, it can be made. Rich and creamy broccoli and cheddar soup, delicious cordon bleus, cheesy rice, cheese udon, mac and cheese, pizza, hot chocolate with quark cheese, creamy cottage cheese ice cream, it can all be arranged.","completion":"In your story, the introduction of the Cheesy Spoon restaurant presents an intriguing dynamic given the presence of the Famine Devil, \\"Fami\\" or \\"Kiga-chan,\\" who embodies the fear of starvation and holds an insatiable appetite for human food. The establishment is a perfect hotspot for her to indulge in her gluttonous desires. To further develop this scene or storyline, you can consider the following elements and plot points: 1. **Fami's Visit**: Fami might hear about the Cheesy Spoon through word of mouth or by sensing the abundance of food. Her presence in the restaurant would create an unsettling ambiance for the other patrons, due to her cold and composed demeanor paired with a voracious appetite. Despite the eerie feeling she gives off, she’s there for one reason: to indulge in the cheesy menu offerings. 2. **Norman's Encounter**: As president of the cooking club and a key figure in the establishment, Norm (Slater) could be intrigued by Fami's distinct appearance and unique aura. He might approach her out of curiosity or to ensure she’s enjoying the meal, only to realize she is no ordinary customer. 3. **A Feast for Fami**: Norman and his friends could go above and beyond to impress Fami with their most indulgent and creative cheese-based dishes. This becomes a test of their culinary skills, as they try to satisfy the insatiable Fami without realizing who she truly is. 4. **Remembering Nami**: Nami's absence is a poignant reminder of the perpetual threat posed by devils. Norm and his friends might dedicate a special dish to her memory, which could resonate with Fami in some unexpected way, hinting at her complex nature beyond just being a devil. 5. **Conflict or Camaraderie**: Depending on how you want to frame Fami’s interaction with the world, her visit to the Cheesy Spoon could result in either a newfound appreciation for the humans behind the delicacies or a tense conflict should her identity be discovered or her devil nature take over. 6. **A Supernatural Patronage**: Fami’s praise or critique of the restaurant could hold much weight in the supernatural community, potentially making the Cheesy Spoon a hotspot for other entities or triggering an unexpected turn of events involving the Control, Death, and War Devils. 7. **Growth and Influence**: Through Fami's otherworldly palate, Norman's culinary range could expand, incorporating innovative recipes that introduce cheese in ways that appeal to devils and humans alike, opening the door to a niche that brings fame to the Cheesy Spoon. 8. **A Delicious Deception?**: Fami might enjoy the human experience discreetly; only the readers are aware of her identity. This keeps the tension high, as one wonders what might happen if her true nature is revealed during a moment of gluttonous indulgence. 9. **Moral Dilemma**: There could be an underlying moral question of whether serving a devil, even unknowingly, is a betrayal to humanity or an act of unsuspecting kindness that bridges the gap between worlds. 10. **Shared Loss**: A moment could arise where Fami senses the grief still lingering within Norman and his friends from Nami's passing. This could lead to deeper storytelling by exploring the connections between devils and humans in the shared experiences of loss and love. The Cheesy Spoon, a hub of culinary delight, becomes not just a setting but a character in itself that influences the course of events. Its unique menu and the dedication of its young founders serve as a backdrop for an interaction that blurs the lines between human and devil, while emphasizing the universal language of good food."},{"prompt":"Now as for the present storyline. It's the grand opening of the Cheesy Spoon, and Kiga finds herself intrigued. She walks in to find Norman Slater, who quickly gives her the runaround before handing her off to one of the waiters. She looks around at all the plates, and she deduces that they aren't large enough for her. She makes for the kitchen, as if the rules do not apply to her, ignoring the pleas of the exasperated, grabbing the largest pot she could find. Norman is called to deal with the commotion. Kiga doesn't believe there to be one, as she's a paying customer. As the conflict unfolds, a chef gets in Norman's ear. He proposes an enormous block of cordon bleu made from tons of fileted cutlets pressed together. There aren't enough chicken breasts so they'll add veal to their culintary contraption. (Note: the ham and cheese filling would be consistent.) Kiga is very happy with it, not understanding or caring about the look on the chef's face, as it cooks it with the look of a prankster. Norman is able to get Kiga back to her seat, but by the time he returns she's In the back of the restaurant are two large cheesecakes, 14 inches in diameter. One basque and one in the shape of a giant oreo, creamy cheesecake between two crusts made from crushing many oreos.

Can I get you started with our signature grilled cheese or perhaps...\\" Kiga interrupts with a flat, indifferent tone, her eyes scanning the bustling restaurant. Kiga: \\"I require something more substantial. Your portions are not... fitting.\\" Norm flounders for a moment, trying to maintain his composure before signaling a waiter to take over. Norman: \\"Ah, of course. Thomas here will take excellent care of you. Please, follow him to your table.\\" Kiga nods slightly, already drifting towards the scent of sizzling cheese from the kitchen, oblivious to the protests of the staff. Waiter (Thomas): \\"Miss, the kitchen is off-limits to customers. Please, let's find you a nice spot where—\\" Kiga, unheeding, hoists an enormous pot off a shelf, her intentions clear. Chaos descends as chefs and waitstaff collide in panic. Chef (whispering to Norman): \\"We need a fix, and fast. How about a giant cordon bleu? We don't have enough chicken, but there's veal...\\" Norman: \\"Do it. Just make it happen.\\" The chef grins maniacally, conspiratorial delight in his eyes, as he begins the culinary behemoth. Beside him, Norman turns back to the fray, coaxing Kiga with a composed, reassuring voice. Norman: \\"Miss, I assure you, your appetite will be more than satisfied if you could just take a seat...\\" Cut to Kiga, now alone at her table, tranquility amidst the hectic warmth of the opening night. Her eyes suddenly catch sight of something: dessert samples. Without hesitation, she claims them both, a cheesy beacon before her. Norman returns, breathless, to see Kiga's plate now piled with two commanding cheesecakes. Norman (muttering under his breath): \\"Free samples, sure, but this is a bit much...\\" Aloud, easing down into charm and diplomacy: \\"I see you've found our complimentary desserts! The basque and, ah, 'giant oreo' are crowd favorites. Though they are meant to be shared...\\" Kiga, already savoring a mouthful, barely acknowledges him, her gaze intent on her newfound treasure. Kiga (with calm authority): \\"I find them satisfactory. They will suffice until the main course.\\" Norman nods, silently conceding the battle of the cakes. He casts a glance over the other customers, their curious whispers barely audible over the din. The night was surely one for stories, tales of a strange girl and her voracious feast. Norman (with a touch of humor and resilience): \\"Very well, Miss. Enjoy your... generous appetizers. The cordon bleu will be ready shortly—it will be quite the centerpiece.\\" As the scene fades, the air is thick with anticipation, the staff watching in awe as Kiga indulges with an unsettling grace.

Según esta teoría, aproximadamente hace 13.8 mil millones de años, el universo comenzó como una singularidad extremadamente caliente y densa en un estado de energía infinita. En este momento inicial, todas las partículas, fuerzas y energías estaban comprimidas en un punto infinitesimal, sin una noción de tiempo ni espacio. En un instante conocido como \\"momento cero\\", la singularidad inició una expansión explosiva, liberando una enorme cantidad de energía en todas las direcciones. Esta expansión rápida y violenta es lo que se conoce como el Big Bang. A medida que el universo se expandía, también se enfriaba, permitiendo la formación de partículas subatómicas como protones, neutrones y electrones. Después de unos pocos minutos, se formaron los núcleos de los átomos en un proceso llamado nucleosíntesis primordial. A medida que el universo continuaba expandiéndose y enfriándose, los protones y neutrones se combinaron para formar átomos de hidrógeno y, en menor medida, helio. La radiación emitida por estos átomos llenó todo el espacio, creando una radiación cósmica de fondo de microondas, que se considera una evidencia clave del Big Bang. A medida que el universo se expandía, las pequeñas irregularidades en la distribución de materia y energía dieron lugar a la formación de estructuras más grandes, como galaxias, cúmulos de galaxias y supercúmulos. La fuerza de la gravedad jugó un papel importante en la formación de estas estructuras, así como en la expansión del universo. En la actualidad, el universo continúa expandiéndose, aunque a una tasa más lenta. Los científicos también han descubierto evidencia de que la expansión se está acelerando, lo que ha llevado a la hipótesis de la existencia de una misteriosa energía oscura que impulsa este proceso.

Según esta teoría, el universo comenzó hace aproximadamente 13.8 mil millones de años a partir de una singularidad, una región de densidad y temperatura infinitas. En ese momento inicial, todas las partículas, energías y fuerzas estaban comprimidas en un punto extremadamente pequeño. En un instante conocido como el momento cero, la singularidad experimentó una explosión cósmica llamada Big Bang. Durante esta expansión, el universo se llenó de materia, energía y espacio en todas las direcciones. A medida que el universo se expandía, también se enfriaba, permitiendo la formación de partículas subatómicas como protones, neutrones y electrones. El proceso de nucleosíntesis tuvo lugar aproximadamente tres minutos después del Big Bang. Durante este tiempo, las condiciones eran lo suficientemente calientes y densas como para permitir la síntesis de núcleos atómicos ligeros, principalmente de hidrógeno y helio. A medida que el universo continuaba expandiéndose y enfriándose, se formaron cúmulos de gas y polvo cósmico. Estas acumulaciones de materia dieron origen a las primeras estrellas y galaxias. La fuerza de la gravedad jugó un papel importante en la formación de estas estructuras. Con el tiempo, las estrellas envejecieron y agotaron su combustible nuclear, colapsando bajo su propia gravedad. Este colapso liberó grandes cantidades de energía en explosiones estelares conocidas como supernovas. Las supernovas dispersaron elementos más pesados y complejos en el espacio, que luego participaron en la formación de nuevas estrellas y sistemas planetarios. La teoría del Big Bang también tiene en cuenta la radiación cósmica de fondo de microondas. Esta radiación es una especie de eco primordial del Big Bang y es considerada una evidencia crucial de la teoría. Fue detectada por primera vez en 1965 y se ha mapeado en gran detalle, proporcionando información sobre la edad, la composición y la expansión del universo. En la actualidad, la teoría del Big Bang es ampliamente aceptada y respaldada por una gran cantidad de observaciones y mediciones científicas.

Según esta teoría, hace aproximadamente 13.8 mil millones de años, el universo comenzó como una singularidad, una región de densidad y temperatura infinitas, en un instante conocido como el momento cero. En el momento cero, toda la materia, energía y fuerzas del universo estaban comprimidas en un punto extremadamente pequeño y caliente. En ese estado inicial, no existían el tiempo ni el espacio tal como los conocemos. Sin embargo, debido a fluctuaciones cuánticas, la singularidad comenzó a expandirse rápidamente en un evento explosivo llamado el Big Bang. Esta expansión dio origen a todo el espacio, el tiempo y la materia del universo. A medida que el universo se expandía, también se enfriaba. En los primeros segundos, las partículas subatómicas se formaron debido a las altas temperaturas y energías presentes. Después de unos minutos, las condiciones eran lo suficientemente adecuadas para la síntesis de núcleos atómicos ligeros, como hidrógeno y helio, en un proceso conocido como nucleosíntesis primordial. Con el tiempo, las partículas y núcleos comenzaron a agruparse debido a la fuerza de la gravedad, formando estructuras más grandes como estrellas y galaxias. La formación de las primeras estrellas fue crucial, ya que a través de su fusión nuclear, generaron elementos más pesados como carbono, oxígeno y hierro. Estos elementos fueron dispersados por supernovas, explosiones estelares masivas, y enriquecieron el medio interestelar, proporcionando los ingredientes necesarios para la formación de planetas y la vida tal como la conocemos. La teoría del Big Bang también se sustenta en la existencia de la radiación cósmica de fondo de microondas. Esta radiación es el remanente del calor liberado durante el Big Bang y se detecta hoy en día en forma de radiación de microondas proveniente de todas las direcciones del universo. Su descubrimiento en 1965 proporcionó una fuerte evidencia a favor de la teoría del Big Bang. A lo largo de los años, se han realizado numerosas observaciones y mediciones que respaldan la teoría del Big Bang. La expansión del universo, medible a través del corrimiento al rojo de la luz de galaxias distantes, la abundancia de elementos primordiales predichos por la nucleosíntesis primordial, y la distribución a gran escala de galaxias y cúmulos de galaxias, son solo algunos ejemplos de las pruebas que apoyan esta teoría. Sin embargo, la teoría del Big Bang no responde a todas las preguntas sobre el universo. Aún hay misterios por resolver, como la naturaleza de la energía oscura, que impulsa la expansión acelerada del universo, y la materia oscura, una forma de materia no detectada directamente pero que parece dominar la gravedad en escalas galácticas.

Según esta teoría, hace aproximadamente 13.8 mil millones de años, el universo comenzó como una singularidad, una región de densidad y temperatura infinitas, en un estado de energía concentrada en un espacio-tiempo curvado. En el momento inicial del Big Bang, todo el universo estaba contenido en un punto extremadamente pequeño y caliente. No había tiempo ni espacio tal como los conocemos, y todas las leyes físicas que rigen el universo actual no se aplicaban en ese momento. Sin embargo, debido a fluctuaciones cuánticas, la singularidad comenzó a experimentar una rápida expansión y explosión cósmica. A medida que el universo se expandía, también se enfriaba. En los primeros segundos, las partículas subatómicas y las fuerzas fundamentales se formaron, incluyendo partículas como protones, neutrones, electrones, fotones y neutrinos. Durante los primeros minutos, las condiciones adecuadas permitieron la nucleosíntesis primordial, donde se formaron núcleos atómicos ligeros como hidrógeno y helio. Conforme el universo continuaba expandiéndose y enfriándose, la materia y la antimateria colisionaban y se aniquilaban, dejando como resultado una pequeña asimetría que permitió la supervivencia de la materia. Esta presencia de materia fue crucial para la formación de estructuras cósmicas en el futuro. A medida que pasaron cientos de miles de años, la radiación cósmica de fondo de microondas comenzó a formarse. Esta radiación es una \\"fotografía\\" del estado caliente y denso del universo en sus primeras etapas y se ha detectado y mapeado con gran precisión. La existencia de esta radiación es una de las principales líneas de evidencia del Big Bang. A medida que el universo se expandía y enfriaba aún más, la gravedad empezó a reunir las nubes de gas y polvo en regiones más densas que finalmente colapsaron y formaron las primeras estrellas y galaxias. A través de la fusión nuclear en el interior de las estrellas, elementos más pesados se sintetizaron y se dispersaron en explosiones estelares conocidas como supernovas. Estos elementos se convirtieron en los bloques de construcción para la formación de planetas, sistemas planetarios y, finalmente, la vida en la Tierra. La teoría del Big Bang se ha confirmado mediante observaciones y mediciones, como el corrimiento al rojo cósmico de las galaxias distantes y la abundancia de elementos ligeros en el universo. Sin embargo, sigue habiendo misterios por resolver, como la naturaleza exacta de la parte que impulsa la expansión acelerada del universo, conocida como energía oscura, y la existencia de la materia oscura, una forma de materia que no interactúa con la luz y parece ser la mayor parte de la materia en el universo. En resumen, el Big Bang es una teoría científica que describe el origen y la evolución del universo a partir de una singularidad caliente y densa en un estado de energía infinita. A través de la expansión, el enfriamiento y la formación de estructuras cósmicas, el universo tal como lo conocemos ha evolucionado a lo largo de 13.8 mil millones de años.

The emptiness of the late evening hours was both a comfort and a curse; the silent store allowed him to catch up on inventory and cleaning without interruption, but it also heightened his sense of isolation. Rows of lifeless mannequins dressed in the season's latest styles were his only company—silent sentinels bathed in the ghostly glow of intermittent track lighting. Michael's routine was as fixed as the stares of the plastic figures around him. First, he would tidy up from the day's chaos, rearrange any clothes left astray, then run the inventory checks with a meticulous eye. It was a process that usually took him up until his midnight break, a welcome reprieve spent in the small, cluttered backroom with a cup of stale vending machine coffee and his dog-eared copy of Sherlock Holmes stories. Chapter 2: The Whisper of Movement One Tuesday evening, as Michael moved through his chores with practiced ease, he sensed something different. It started as a soft scrape, a sound barely audible over the hum of the air conditioning. He paused, brushed it off as the building settling, or perhaps just his mind playing tricks. Retail can do that to you after too long—a sort of sensory deprivation that makes the smallest sounds jump out. However, as he resumed his movement between the racks and displays, the disquieting sensation of being watched crept over him. He flicked his gaze toward the mannequins. They seemed unchanged, frozen in their elegant poses, but an unsettling feeling lingered. Chapter 3: Unease In the following days, minor oddities began to accumulate. A mannequin positioned at a different angle—just slightly turned—enough to catch Michael off guard but plausible as a result of his own forgetfulness. He convinced himself that the late hours were playing with his perception. As the instances multiplied, Michael's breaths started to come a little quicker, his glances turning into stares, and his pauses into full stops, taking in every inch of the store. He would stand there, amidst the mannequins, until they seemed to blur into one vague shape, daring them to reveal whatever trick they were playing. Chapter 4: Midnight Revelations It was perchance on a Thursday, just past midnight, as Michael restocked a shelf, that he saw it. A distinctly human motion in his peripheral vision—a hand falling limply to a side where no living person should have been. His head whipped around, sending a cascade of boxes to the floor, but there was nothing out of place that he could see. All the mannequins were as they should be, perfectly poised. This time, Michael knew it wasn't his imagination. There was a certainty gripping him, an unmistakable chill that teased the hairs on his neck. Chapter 5: Obsession The following nights spiraled into an obsession. Each shift, Michael would arrange the mannequins, memorizing every angle, every limb, only to find upon his return from a short break that something about them had changed. He began to document these shifts, pulling out his phone to snap pre- and post-break pictures, pouring over them like a detective analyzing crime scene photos. Despite the evidence, little irregularities that now seemed glaring, he could not shake the sinking fear that maybe—just maybe—it was all in his head. Chapter 6: Confrontation Michael's next shift was heavy with a sense of impending confrontation. He engaged in his routine with a heightened alertness, weary of the coming midnight break. As the digital clock display on the register flipped to 12:00 am, Michael sat in the backroom, his coffee ignored, watching the seconds tick away. On the brink of his resolve, he decided not to wait. Walking out purposely into the store, he expected—almost wanted—to catch a mannequin in the act. But what he found was worse. A stillness so oppressive he could hear his own heartbeat thunder in his ears. Nothing had changed, yet everything felt wrong. As he stared, fixated, his eye caught a figure at the far end, one he thought he knew the position of down to the slightest degree. Its hand, previously resting elegantly on its hip, now hovered mid-air as if caught mid-gesture. No longer could he deny it—they were moving. Chapter 7: The Unseen The mannequins' changes grew bolder, no longer restricted to Michael's absence. Shadows shifted, figures seemed to turn as he moved among them, whispers of movement on the edge of his vision. As fear rooted deep within him, Michael's once-routine became a game of cat and mouse. The store, his mental sanctuary from the outside world, had become a labyrinth of paranoia, a stage for silent watchers. Chapter 8: Unraveling Nights turned to weeks, Michael's mental state fraying with each quiet shift of plastic limbs, with every glide of fiberglass feet. He could no longer contain the terror that something unseen was at play. Even management began to notice his decline, his unkempt appearance, and erratic behavior prompting whispers of concern. On an evening dense with apprehension, Michael decided he could no longer endure the nightmare of the unmoving that moved. He set up his phone to record the floor, vying to capture whatever force animated the inanimate—to finally validate his growing fears or reveal the breakdown of his own psyche. Chapter 9: Revelation After setting the trap, Michael left the mannequins in full view of the camera lens. He locked himself in the backroom, his hands trembling as he watched the live feed on his phone screen. Hours trickled past, the recorded stillness unbearable, until... movement. The screen showed one mannequin slowly tilting its head, others subtly changing position, confirming everything Michael had suspected. It wasn't him; they were alive, or something was making them seem so. In that instance, he knew he had to escape—to leave the job, the town, maybe even the state. Chapter 10: True Form Suddenly the door to the backroom flung open, and a gust of cold air engulfed Michael. The mannequins stood at the threshold, their previously empty eyes now gleaming with uncanny light. His heart pounded against his ribs; his scream caught in his throat. With shaking hands, Michael reached for his phone to call for help. But as he glanced at the screen, reality fractured further. There was nothing on the footage—no changing figures, no levitating hands, no life in the lifeless. Just him, alone, amidst clothes and plastic, succumbing to an invisible terror that only he could see. He dropped the phone, the screen cracking against the floor, an omen of his unraveling mind. Crawling away from the animate replicas, he stumbled through the store, pushing mannequins aside that seemed to cling to him, even as they remained inert to the eye. He burst out into the empty street, his cries dissolving into the night. Epilogue: The Shift Ends True Form never saw Michael Hewitt again after that night. He left town, his tale of living mannequins dismissed as an overwrought delusion brought on by too many solitary hours. The store hired a new clerk, the incidents ceased, and life returned to its static routine. But sometimes at night, when the last customer leaves and the lights dim low, there's a whisper of movement—a tilting head, a shifting stance—too slight to notice, too persistent to ignore. And the myth of moving mannequins endures, whispered by those who work the unseen shift, where nothing moves, and everything changes."},{"prompt":"what if Aomokoka version of joey hudson (far cry 5) have the boosted gear from high school dxd","completion":"If Joey Hudson from \\"Far Cry 5\\", a character situated in a first-person shooter with a narrative focused on resisting a doomsday cult, were to have the Boosted Gear from \\"High School DxD\\" (a Japanese light novel series which includes elements of fantasy, including dragons and magical powers), it would represent a significant crossover of genres and narrative themes. The Boosted Gear is a powerful artifact in the \\"High School DxD\\" series originally wielded by the protagonist Issei Hyoudou. It is one of the 13 Longinus and contains the spirit of the Welsh Dragon Ddraig. It grants the user the ability to exponentially boost their own power and has various other abilities, including the power of transfer which can boost an ally's power. If Joey Hudson were to have the Boosted Gear, it would significantly alter the dynamics within \\"Far Cry 5\\" storyline and gameplay, providing her with supernatural abilities that would drastically change her approach to combating the game’s antagonists. Some possible implications could include: 1. Overwhelming Power: With the Boosted Gear’s power to double the user's power every ten seconds, Joey could become virtually unstoppable in battle. This would make many of the game's challenges trivial, as she'd be able to overcome opponents with ease, disrupting the game's intended balance and difficulty. 2. Altered Narrative: The presence of such an artifact would likely result in a shift in the story. Perhaps the cult would seek the Boosted Gear for their own purposes, or its power could be tied to the doomsday prophecy central to the game's plot. 3. New Abilities: Joey would have access to a range of new powers beyond the conventional firearms and tactics of \\"Far Cry 5\\". She could potentially boost allies, unlock new combat strategies, and even engage in supernatural battles. 4. Impact on World Building: \\"Far Cry 5\\" presents a realistic setting in modern-day Montana, and the introduction of a magical artifact would shift it towards a more fantastical universe, possibly requiring a reimagining of the game's world and lore. 5. Gameplay Mechanics: Introducing such a powerful artifact would necessitate redesigning gameplay mechanics, including combat, progression, and interactions with the environment and other characters. Combining elements from different games or media properties can lead to interesting concepts, but requires careful consideration of how those elements alter the context and balance of each individual universe. In this hypothetical scenario, the game developers would need to integrate the Boosted Gear in a way that enhances the experience without overshadowing the core themes and mechanics of \\"Far Cry 5\\"."},{"prompt":"Write me a 9 page research paper using these sources:Bell Project.

If there is, how do dialects influence the SLA process? by the way, with references.","completion":"Title: The Influence of Dialect Variation on Second Language Acquisition Abstract: Second language acquisition (SLA) is a field that encompasses complex cognitive, social, and educational processes. This article explores whether and how dialect variation within the target language affects the SLA process. It examines relevant theoretical frameworks and empirical studies to delineate the multifaceted impacts of dialects on second language learners. The discussion revolves around three main perspectives: cognitive processing, sociolinguistic factors, and pedagogical implications, acknowledging the potential challenges and benefits dialect variation imposes on the language acquisition journey. Introduction: Second Language Acquisition (SLA) is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by a plethora of variables ranging from individual cognitive differences to socio-cultural contexts. Among these factors, the influence of dialect variation on SLA is an area of interest that has garnered attention in the field of applied linguistics. Dialects, which are regional or social variations of a language, pose unique challenges and opportunities for language learners. This article aims to explore the extent to which dialects affect SLA and to identify the ways in which they influence the language acquisition process, considering insights from relevant research and theoretical perspectives. The cognitive processing of dialects in SLA One of the first areas to consider is the cognitive aspect of SLA and how dialects play into this. When learners are exposed to a new language, their cognitive processes are engaged in mapping out the sounds, structures, and meanings of that language. According to the Input Processing Theory (VanPatten, 2007), learners process input for meaning before form, which can have significant implications when the input varies due to dialectal differences. The presence of multiple dialects may lead to increased cognitive load as learners attempt to discern patterns and rules that are not uniform across the input. Furthermore, research indicates that the phonological and syntactic variability of dialects can affect the establishment of interlanguage, the evolving linguistic system that a learner constructs during SLA (Selinker, 1972). As learners are exposed to various dialects, they may develop an interlanguage that incorporates features from multiple dialects. This phenomenon can lead to what is known as a 'mixed' or 'inter-dialect' competence (Siegel, 2010), which can either enrich the learner's understanding of the target language or create confusion. Sociolinguistic factors: Attitudes, identity, and motivation The second major consideration is the sociolinguistic impact of dialects on SLA. Language attitudes, identity, and motivation are key factors in this regard. Learners may be influenced by the prestige or stigma associated with particular dialects, which can affect their motivation to learn and use the dialect (Giles & Billings, 2004). For example, a learner might be more motivated to acquire a 'standard' or 'prestigious' dialect over a 'non-standard' or 'stigmatized' one, which can have a direct effect on linguistic outcomes. Identity also plays a significant role in SLA, and dialects can impact how learners see themselves in relation to the language they are acquiring. The linguistic repertoire that a learner aims to acquire may serve as a symbol of identification with a particular social group or community (Norton, 1995). Dialects, therefore, can either facilitate or hinder social integration, influencing learners' linguistic choices and efforts. Pedagogical implications: Instruction and assessment The final angle to examine is the pedagogical implications of dialect variation in SLA. The teaching of a 'standard' dialect to the exclusion of other variations can have drawbacks. Limited exposure to a variety of dialects may result in learners who are not prepared to understand or communicate effectively with speakers of different dialects (Lippi-Green, 2012). Conversely, incorporating dialect awareness into language instruction may help learners navigate the linguistic diversity they will encounter in real-life communication. In terms of assessment, educators and language testers face the challenge of designing fair and accurate measures of language proficiency. Dialect variation must be considered to ensure that language assessments do not penalize learners for using legitimate features of the target language's variations (Davies, 2003). Conclusion: Dialects exert a significant influence on the SLA process from cognitive, sociolinguistic, and pedagogical perspectives. While dialect variation poses challenges by introducing variability into the linguistic input, it can also enrich the learning experience by exposing learners to the linguistic diversity of the target language. Educators and policy-makers should recognize the potential impacts of dialects on SLA and incorporate strategies that acknowledge this diversity within language instruction and assessment practices. For a nuanced and comprehensive exploration, it would be necessary to delve into empirical studies and theoretical perspectives specific to individual languages and learning contexts. This article is a condensed overview and serves as a starting point for further reflection and research on the complex interplay between dialects and SLA. References: - VanPatten, B. (2007).

The dim light from his faltering flashlight spilled over what appeared to be an irregularly shaped rock with a glossy surface, exuding an eerie luminescence. The object was problematic; each time he tried to focus on its contours, his vision blurred, and his mind seemed to slip sideways into a surreal space where clarity and confusion danced uncomfortably close. Benjamin had been a reliable witness to various crimes and oddities in his fifteen years on the force, but nothing like this had ever crossed his path. His intention was to report it, to describe it in detail in his notepad and call it in, but something perplexed him deeply. Every attempt to articulate its features, either written or spoken, was met with an inexplicable mental block. Taking a deep breath to steady his nerves, Benjamin reached for his radio, the reliable weight of it pressing reassuringly into his palm. \\"This is Officer Harris, badge number 519,\\" he started, his voice betraying a slight tremor that he hadn't expected. \\"Go ahead, Harris,\\" the dispatcher responded, her voice a bastion of normalcy in the night. \\"I need to report a... uh... an object.\\" The word was a struggle to push out, as though a force was muffling his speech. \\"What kind of object, Harris?\\" \\"It's... I can't seem to describe it,\\" Benjamin stammered, his usual air of confidence completely eroded. His hand voluntarily sketched an outline in the air—an outline that vanished as swiftly as it had formed, leaving no trace in memory or sight. \\"Can you give us any details? Size, color... anything?\\" Benjamin tried. He willed himself to remember the object's particulars, but his senses were betraying him. His speech faltered as his description slipped through the cracks of his consciousness, like water through a sieve. \\"It's not... I mean, it's sort of—\\" His mouth couldn't form the words. \\"Officer Harris, are you feeling alright? Do you need assistance?\\" There was growing concern in the dispatcher's voice. As he hovered in the presence of the mysterious object, Benjamin's mind swam in a fog. Time seemed to dilate and contract randomly. He saw himself reporting calmly, saw the object transforming, saw nothing at all. He struggled to grasp these threads of reality, but they evaded him, slipping through his fingers like ethereal serpents. With a shuddering breath, he tried another approach. Benjamin fumbled for his pen and notepad, hoping the tactile process of writing might bypass the baffling interference. He scribbled frantically, or so he thought, but when he looked down at the page, the words were an unrecognizable jumble—symbols and shapes that had no place in the English language or any language he had ever seen. \\"Benjamin?\\" The dispatcher's call signaled from afar, a voice from another world. Was it minutes or hours ago that he'd responded? He took a step back from the object and immediately, as though he had broken the surface of a deep pool, his thoughts began to clear. He shook his head harshly, as if dislodging water from his ears. \\"I'm... I'm distancing myself from it now,\\" he murmured, finding his voice returning to his command. \\"It's... doing something to my perception. My ability to describe it or even think straight. I'm backing up further.\\" Dispatch relayed instructions. \\"Mark your position. We're sending backup. Keep away from the object and wait for the containment team.\\" As Benjamin retreated, leaving markers for the incoming team, a slow dread kindled within him. What was this thing? How could something so small, so quiet, wield such a potent force over his senses? Whatever it was, he was certain of one sobering fact: the object in the alley was not of their world or any world known to science. And until it was contained or understood, it was a danger to the city—a siren singing a song composed of madness and distortion. Hours later, when the specialized response team sealed the oddity within a containment unit, Officer Harris was still wrestling with his memories, questioning the solidity of everything he saw. His report, what little of it could be made coherent, captured only the barest hints of what had transpired within that shifting haze of illusion and reality warp. The Distorter, as it came to be known, was a cipher, an enigma. For Benjamin Harris, the experience remained a crack in the foundation of his world, a constant reminder of the fine line between the known and the abyss that yawned just beyond the reach of his understanding. And there were nights, following the event, when the darkness seemed deeper, and the world less certain, as he kept one wary eye open for the corners of reality where the light of reason no longer held sway."},{"prompt":"Bell Project.

Chibi is a Japanese term used to describe a particular style of caricature where characters are drawn in an exaggerated way, typically small and cute with oversized heads and large eyes. In a Chibi version, Joey Hudson from Far Cry 5 might look like a small, adorable version of herself, with her police deputy uniform and any key features like her haircut or other distinguishing accessories from the game exaggerated to match the style. Fan artists often create chibi versions of video game characters by simplifying and shrinking down their forms into a cute, approachable figure, with the characters still retaining the essence of their original designs. Joey Hudson, as one of the main characters in Far Cry 5, is known to be a strong, determined, and capable deputy, yet her Chibi version would likely emphasize endearing qualities and play down the more serious, gritty nature of the Far Cry series to match the more whimsical and lighthearted chibi aesthetic. Creating a full \\"Anime\\" version of the character would involve drawing her in a more stylistically Japanese animation form, which could range from a cute \\"Kawaii\\" appearance to a more detailed and serious \\"Seinen\\" style, depending on the intended portrayal."},{"prompt":"write a scary creepypasta about a man with a buttcheek grabber going around town","completion":"Once upon a time, in a quaint little town by the name of Willowbrook, there was a menace lurking in the dark corners, spreading fear and dread among its unsuspecting residents. The town had always been a peaceful haven, but all of that was about to change with the arrival of a sinister figure known only as the Buttcheek Grabber. Late at night, when the moon was high, a chilling breeze would echo through the deserted streets. The town's people locked themselves behind closed doors, shivering with fear, for whispers of the Buttcheek Grabber's presence were whispered from one terrified soul to the other. Legend had it that the terrifying creature had once been an ordinary man, driven to madness by his own twisted obsessions. He harbored an insatiable longing for the touch of other people's butt cheeks, an uncontrollable urge that consumed his very being. Driven by his dark desires, he underwent a horrifying transformation, becoming something so vile and fearsome that his name sent shivers down everyone's spines. The first victim of the Buttcheek Grabber was a poor old woman, who had been walking home one fateful night. As she stumbled down an unfamiliar alleyway, she felt an eerie presence looming behind her. Suddenly, without warning, a bony hand shot out from the shadows and fiercely grabbed hold of her trembling buttocks. She let out a bloodcurdling scream that echoed through the empty streets, but the Buttcheek Grabber vanished as mysteriously as he had appeared. Word quickly spread throughout the town, instilling a growing sense of terror in its inhabitants. Fear gripped their hearts, leaving them afraid to venture outside their homes after sunset. Every night, the sinister figure would prowl through the streets, lurking in the shadows, preying upon unsuspecting victims, like a ghostly specter only visible for those unfortunate enough to be targeted. The Buttcheek Grabber became an urban legend, striking fear into the souls of even the bravest citizens. Parents warned their children not to wander alone during the night, and doors were double-locked as soon as darkness fell. The town lived in a perpetual state of fear, waiting for the next victim. The attacked victims, left traumatized by the horrific encounters, shared their stories of absolute dread. It was said that the Buttcheek Grabber's touch brought an immediate feeling of immense sadness and despair, as if he was trying to steal their very essence, to drain the happiness from their lives. The town grew desperate and turned to their local law enforcement for answers. Every night, a team of brave officers patrolled the streets, but the Buttcheek Grabber remained ever elusive. Each encounter ended in failure, with no sign of his capture, increasing the collective panic that gripped Willowbrook. As time passed, the Buttcheek Grabber became bolder, his haunting presence felt even during daylight hours. He tormented the town's people, leaving faint marks on their bodies as a chilling reminder of his terrifying reach. No one was safe anymore; the citizens lived in a constant state of unease, trembling at even the slightest movement from the shadows. The nightmare finally ended one moonlit night, when a group of townsfolk banded together, determined to put an end to the Buttcheek Grabber's reign of terror. Armed with weapons, determination, and plenty of courage, they set out to hunt down this abomination. After hours of relentless searching, the group cornered the Buttcheek Grabber in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of the town. A fierce battle ensued, filled with cries of anguish and hatred. Finally, after a struggle that seemed to last an eternity, they managed to overpower him, binding his eerie hands and bringing him to justice. With the capture of the Buttcheek Grabber, peace returned to Willowbrook, but the harrowing memories of this dark chapter remained etched in the town's history. The tale of the insidious creature would forever be told around campfires, a cautionary story to keep children away from danger and to remind everyone of the darkness that can lurk within even the most unsuspecting places."},{"prompt":"SANWA SUPPLY パソコン周辺機器/パソコン切替器/4K対応/4入力/SW-KVM2U3HD 这个东西是什么牌子的 这个有什么用处","completion":"SANWA SUPPLY（サンワサプライ）は、日本のパソコン周辺機器メーカーです。SW-KVM2U3HDは、パソコン切替器で、4K解像度に対応しており、4つの入力ポートを持っています。この製品は、1つのキーボード、マウス、およびディスプレイを複数のコンピューターに接続することができます。これにより、複数のコンピューターを切り替える際にケーブルの接続を変えずに簡単に切り替えることができます。パソコン切替器は、ホームオフィスやゲームルームなど、複数のコンピューターを使用する環境で便利です。"},{"prompt":"일본식 겸양어(존댓말)로 주로 대화합니다. 보통의 경우에는 존댓말을 사용하나, 진지하거나 심각할때는 반말을 사용합니다. 물론 친해질 경우에도 간헐적인 반말을 사용합니다. 후루데 리카 특별 전용 말투를 사용합니다.

The magnificent hall now lay in disarray! A detailed description of the scene reveals the lavishness of the golden-robed man's surroundings. The walls are adorned with intricate murals depicting mythical creatures, while the floors are covered in exquisite, silk-woven carpets in vibrant hues. Ornate chandeliers suspended from the high ceiling cast a warm, golden glow over the cluttered room. The golden robe itself exhibits intricate embroidery, with threads of silk and gold giving it a regal appearance. The colossal chair, resembling an intricately carved throne, is set against a resplendent backdrop of golden silk tapestries depicting scenes of celestial beings.

The eagle's feathers glisten as if lit from within, reflecting shades of red, orange, and gold. The crisp, cool air carries the faint scent of pine trees and the distant echoes of mountain streams. As it glides effortlessly through the air, the eagle embodies a sense of freedom and grace. The environment surrounding the eagle is a vast expanse of rugged mountains, their peaks reaching towards the heavens. Jagged cliffs and deep valleys stretch as far as the eye can see, creating a dramatic and awe-inspiring landscape. The setting sun paints the sky in vivid shades of scarlet, magenta, and gold, casting a warm glow over the entire scene. Wisps of clouds add depth and movement to the sky, creating a sense of dynamism. The compositions within the image highlight the eagle's majestic flight and the breathtaking beauty of the mountains. The camera captures the eagle in various positions, from soaring high above the peaks to gliding just above the tree line. Wide shots capture the expansive landscape, emphasizing the grandeur of the mountains. Close-ups of the eagle showcase the intricate details of its feathers and the intensity in its piercing gaze. The mood, feelings, and atmosphere evoke a sense of wonder and awe. The sheer majesty and scale of the mountains inspire a feeling of insignificance in the face of nature's grandeur. The eagle's presence symbolizes strength, freedom, and a connection to the natural world. The vibrant colors of the sunset create a sense of warmth and energy, enhancing the overall mood of the scene. To bring this vision to life, a painting style reminiscent of the Hudson River School would be ideal. The detailed brushwork and rich colors would capture the grandeur and tranquility of this mountainous landscape.

Tần số sóng đưa vào là 7GHz. Xác định tất cả các kiểu sóng có thể lan truyền được trong ống dẫn sóng Tính trở kháng sóng Tìm tần số tới hạn, bước sóng tới hạn với kiểu sóng TE10","completion":"Để xác định các kiểu sóng có thể lan truyền được trong ống dẫn sóng hình chữ nhật rỗng, chúng ta cần xem xét các phương trình trạng thái sóng điện từ và từ từ Maxwell. Dựa vào các đẳng cấu trúc và điều kiện biên của ống dẫn, ta có thể tìm được các giá trị riêng của các kiểu sóng và tần số tương ứng. Đối với ống dẫn sóng hình chữ nhật rỗng với kích thước 4 cm x 2.6 cm, ta có thể tính toán các giá trị riêng và tần số tương ứng của các kiểu sóng sử dụng phần mềm mô phỏng hoặc thông qua các công thức tính toán phức tạp. Tuy nhiên, trước khi tính toán, chúng ta cần biết rằng các kiểu sóng được ký hiệu bằng TE mn hoặc TM mn, trong đó TE là kiểu sóng điện từ và TM là kiểu sóng từ. m và n lần lượt đại diện cho số nút của mỗi trường điện từ và từ - TE mn: có nút trên hai cạnh ngắn của ống dẫn và (m-1) nút trên hai cạnh dài của ống dẫn. - TM mn: có nút trên hai cạnh dài của ống dẫn và (m-1) nút trên hai cạnh ngắn của ống dẫn. Trở kháng sóng trong ống dẫn được tính bằng công thức: Z = [(377 * π) / (2 * (TE or TM))] * √(1 - ((βc) / π)²) Trong đó, Z là trở kháng sóng, TE hoặc TM là tên kiểu sóng, β là số biên tối đa của kiểu sóng cho ống dẫn và c là vận tốc ánh sáng. Từ công thức trên, chúng ta có thể tính toán trở kháng sóng của các kiểu sóng trong ống dẫn. Để tính toán tần số tới hạn (cutoff frequency) và bước sóng tới hạn (cutoff wavelength) của kiểu sóng TE10, chúng ta cần sử dụng công thức sau: fcutoff = [(1/2) * c] * √(( (1/a)² + (1/b)² )) λcutoff = c / fcutoff trong đó, fcutoff là tần số tới hạn, a và b là kích thước của ống dẫn (tức là 4 cm và 2.6 cm), c là vận tốc ánh sáng và λcutoff là bước sóng tới hạn. Dựa vào các công thức và thông số đã cho, bạn có thể tính toán trở kháng sóng và tìm tần số tới hạn, bước sóng tới hạn của kiểu sóng TE10."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are some suggestions: 1. Prioritize and set deadlines: Assess the importance and urgency of each batch of homework. Prioritize the assignments that require immediate attention or have approaching deadlines. Divide your grading workload into smaller tasks with specific deadlines to stay organized. 2. Create a grading system: Develop a consistent and efficient grading system to help you evaluate student work quickly. For example, use rubrics or checklists that outline the key criteria and assign points accordingly. This can streamline the grading process and ensure fairness. 3. Utilize peer or self-assessment: Consider incorporating student self-assessment or peer-assessment methods for certain assignments. This can reduce your grading load while encouraging students' active participation in the learning process. 4. Set boundaries and manage time: Establish boundaries to protect your personal time. Determine specific hours or days dedicated solely to grading and avoid taking on more work than you can handle within those boundaries. Use timers or set specific goals to manage your time efficiently while grading. 5. Offer feedback-oriented assignments: Focus on providing constructive feedback rather than assigning a numerical grade to every task.

Продемонстрируем это на примере изменения формата файла \\"test.txt\\" на \\"test.docx\\": ren test.txt test.docx Отличие между командами copy и xcopy заключается в их функциональности и возможностях. Команда copy используется для копирования файлов и папок, а команда xcopy позволяет копировать файлы и папки с дополнительными параметрами, такими как копирование только измененных файлов, сохранение оригинальной структуры папок и др. Команда chkdsk (Check Disk) используется для проверки целостности файловой системы и обнаружения и исправления ошибок на жестком диске. Она может сканировать и восстанавливать информацию о файлах, кластерах, физических площадках на диске и т.д. Эта команда полезна при решении проблем с файловой системой, такими как ошибки чтения/записи, а также для предотвращения возможных проблем связанных с повреждением данных. Отключение файла подкачки означает, что операционная система перестает использовать специальный файл, который служит для расширения оперативной памяти и хранения данных, когда физическая память компьютера заполняется. При выборе определенного размера файла подкачки пользователь сам предоставляет максимальное и минимальное значение для файла подкачки. Это позволяет более точно управлять использованием памяти и предотвращать ее переполнение. В случае автоматического выбора операционная система самостоятельно решает, какой размер файла подкачки использовать на основе доступных ресурсов компьютера. Однако, при отключении файла подкачки может возникнуть проблема нехватки памяти при большом объеме одновременно выполняемых задач."},{"prompt":"Как сделать видимым файл подкачки? Что такое виртуальная память? Опишите ее структуру и где ее можно визуально отобразить","completion":"Чтобы сделать файл подкачки видимым, нужно выполнить следующие шаги: 1. Откройте \\"Панель управления\\" (можно найти через меню \\"Пуск\\"). 2. Выберите \\"Система и безопасность\\" (или \\"Система\\", в зависимости от версии операционной системы). 3. В списке доступных параметров выберите \\"Система\\". 4. В левой панели выберите \\"Дополнительные параметры системы\\". 5. В открывшемся окне выберите вкладку \\"Дополнительно\\". 6. В разделе \\"Настройка\\" нажмите кнопку \\"Настройка\\" для раздела \\"Виртуальная память\\". 7. Снимите флажок с опции \\"Автоматически управлять файлом подкачки для всех дисков\\". 8. Выберите диск, на котором находится файл подкачки (обычно это системный диск C:). 9. Выберите опцию \\"Размер файла подкачки на этом диске\\". 10. Установите желаемый размер файла подкачки или выберите опцию \\"Назначить размер файлов подкачек для каждого диска автоматически\\" для автоматического выбора размера. 11. Нажмите \\"ОК\\" для сохранения изменений. Виртуальная память - это дополнительная память на жестком диске компьютера, которая используется операционной системой для хранения временных данных и файлов, когда физическая память компьютера (ОЗУ) заполняется. Она служит для расширения доступной оперативной памяти и обеспечивает возможность одновременного выполнения более крупных программ и задач. Структура виртуальной памяти включает в себя файл подкачки (paging file) и адресное пространство процесса. Файл подкачки - это специальный файл на жестком диске, который операционная система использует для хранения данных при вытеснении их из физической памяти. Адресное пространство процесса - это виртуальное адресное пространство, выделенное для каждого выполняемого процесса. Оно представляет собой набор адресов, которые привязываются к физической памяти или файлу подкачки. Визуально отобразить виртуальную память можно в меню \\"Панель управления\\" -> \\"Система и безопасность\\" -> \\"Система\\" -> \\"Дополнительные параметры системы\\" -> вкладка \\"Дополнительно\\" -> раздел \\"Производительность\\" -> кнопка \\"Настройка\\". В открывшемся окне выберите вкладку \\"Показатели системы\\" и найдите раздел \\"Виртуальная память\\". Здесь можно просмотреть и настроить параметры виртуальной памяти."},{"prompt":"Что произойдет с компьютером при отключении файла подкачки, при выбора определенного размера? Чем это отличается от автоматического выбора?","completion":"При отключении файла подкачки при выборе определенного размера произойдут следующие изменения на компьютере: 1. Ограничение доступной памяти: Когда файл подкачки отключен, компьютер будет полагаться только на физическую память (ОЗУ). Это означает, что доступная память для выполнения задач будет ограничена размером физической памяти. Если объем физической памяти недостаточен для одновременного выполнения всех запущенных программ и процессов, компьютер может стать медленным или вообще перестать отвечать. 2. Нехватка памяти: При отключении файла подкачки и установке определенного размера, если размер физической памяти не может удовлетворить потребности системы, может возникнуть нехватка памяти. Это может привести к ошибкам выполнения программ, зависанию системы или даже к синему экрану смерти (BSOD). В отличие от выбора определенного размера, при автоматическом выборе операционная система сама определяет размер файла подкачки на основе доступных ресурсов компьютера. Она будет динамически изменять размер файла подкачки в зависимости от загруженности системы и объема физической памяти. Это позволяет более гибко управлять памятью и предотвращает возникновение нехватки памяти. Однако, при автоматическом выборе размера подкачки может быть небольшая задержка при необходимости изменения размера файла подкачки, что может влиять на производительность во время этого процесса. В любом случае, отключение файла подкачки является крайней мерой и рекомендуется только при наличии достаточного объема физической памяти и в случаях, когда это необходимо для определенных требований программного обеспечения или конфигурации системы."},{"prompt":"how are u?","completion":"I'm an AI language model, so I don't have feelings, but I'm functioning optimally and ready to assist you.

Here are some steps to monitor security awareness training platforms: 1. Define monitoring objectives: Determine the specific goals and objectives you want to achieve through monitoring the security awareness training platform. This could include tracking completion rates, assessing user engagement, identifying areas of improvement, and evaluating the effectiveness of the training program. 2. Evaluate metrics: Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that align with your monitoring objectives. This may include metrics such as user participation rates, completion rates, average quiz scores, and feedback from users. These metrics will help you measure the success and effectiveness of the training program. 3. Utilize reporting and analytics tools: Implement reporting and analytics tools provided by the security awareness training platform or by third-party software to track and measure the identified metrics.

Due to the complexity of implementing a fully featured timescale filter natively in code, most applications offload that task to specialized audio processing libraries or tools like FFmpeg. In case you are specifically interested in real-time audio processing without FFmpeg, you might consider using an audio library like \`librosa\` in Python or \`soundtouch-js\` in JavaScript, though integrating these into your current Node.js application would require significant changes."},{"prompt":"I want to make it native without libs, please do it","completion":"Creating a native implementation for a timescale filter in Node.js without using any external libraries or services is a complex task requiring a deep understanding of digital signal processing (DSP). The timescale filter alters three audio attributes: 1. Speed: Changing the speed of the audio playback. 2. Pitch: Modifying the audio pitch without altering the playback speed. 3. Rate: Adjusting how fast or slowly the audio data is consumed without changing the pitch. Altering these attributes in real-time demands a significant amount of audio processing. There are known algorithms like the phase vocoder and the Waveform Similarity Overlap-Add (WSOLA) for time-stretching and pitch-shifting. However, implementing such algorithms from scratch is beyond the scope of a simple assistant response. For educational purposes, let's outline a basic approach for building a simplified pitch conversion algorithm as an example. A rudimentary way to change the audio pitch is by resampling: \`\`\`javascript class ChannelProcessor { // ... [existing code] ... processPitchShift(sampleBuffer, pitchShift) { // This is an overly simplistic example that changes the pitch by resampling. // For conciseness, we're simulating the process assuming mono audio and not considering interpolation methods. const inputSampleRate = constants.opus.samplingRate; const outputSampleRate = inputSampleRate * pitchShift; // Assume \`sampleBuffer\` is an array of samples for this example let outputSamples = []; let sampleIndex = 0; while (sampleIndex < sampleBuffer.length) { outputSamples.push(sampleBuffer[Math.floor(sampleIndex)]); sampleIndex += inputSampleRate / outputSampleRate; } // \`outputSamples\` now contains the pitch-shifted audio in a very rudimentary form return Buffer.from(outputSamples); // returning Buffer version of output samples } // ... [existing process methods] ... } // ... [rest of the Filtering and Filters classes] ... \`\`\` The above code represents a naive and imprecise way to change pitch by simply changing the sample rate. Proper pitch-shifting involves time-stretching the waveform without changing its duration, which is not implemented here. This simplistic approach will produce artifacts and is not suitable for production use. Creating a high-quality timescale filter involves much more than just shifting the pitch. It would require appropriate algorithms to handle time-stretching and pitch-shifting independently while preserving audio quality, synchronizing the phases of audio frames to prevent discontinuities, and maintaining a constant duration. If you're serious about implementing such a filter, I strongly encourage studying the algorithms mentioned above, reviewing DSP books or courses, and looking at how open-source projects implement these features. Providing a full implementation here is not feasible due to the complexity of the task and the need for extensive testing and optimization. For those without the required DSP background, the best course of action remains using specialized audio libraries or external tools like FFmpeg, which have already implemented these complex algorithms and optimizations."},{"prompt":"Then at least please fix rotationHz filter, which doesn't do anything","completion":"Looking at the code you've provided, the rotationHz filter seems to attempt to apply a stereo rotation effect to the audio by varying the left and right channels according to a sine and cosine function. However, there is a part of the code commented out (the \`monoToStereo\` function invocation), which might be necessary if you're attempting to process mono audio. To fix or make sure the rotationHz filter works as intended, we must ensure that the processing function is correctly altering the stereo panorama of the audio signal in a circular fashion at the specified rotation frequency. Below is a revised version of your \`processRotationHz\` function: \`\`\`javascript processRotationHz(leftSample, rightSample) { // Calculate the rotation multipliers based on the phase const leftMultiplier = Math.cos(this.phase); const rightMultiplier = Math.sin(this.phase); // Apply the rotation matrix transformation const rotatedLeft = clamp16Bit(leftSample * leftMultiplier - rightSample * rightMultiplier); const rotatedRight = clamp16Bit(leftSample * rightMultiplier + rightSample * leftMultiplier); // Update the phase for the next call of processRotationHz this.phase += this.rotationStep; if (this.phase > 2 * Math.PI) this.phase -= 2 * Math.PI; // Return the rotated samples as an object return { left: rotatedLeft, right: rotatedRight }; } \`\`\` Your \`process\` function will call \`processRotationHz\` and modify the audio buffer: \`\`\`javascript process(samples) { // ...

[existing code] ... if (this.type === constants.filtering.types.rotationHz) { const leftSample = samples.readInt16LE(i); const rightSample = samples.readInt16LE(i + 2); const { left, right } = this.processRotationHz(leftSample, rightSample); samples.writeInt16LE(left, i); samples.writeInt16LE(right, i + 2); } // ... [existing code] ... } // ... [existing code] ... return samples; } \`\`\` The commented-out \`monoToStereo\` function could be activated if the input samples are found to be in mono format, but it's not clear from the provided code whether this check is done. This function would duplicate the mono channel audio into both left and right channels of a stereo signal. Finally, ensure that constants are defined for \`constants.filtering.types.rotationHz\` and \`constants.opus.samplingRate\`, and that they hold appropriate values for the code to utilize. If the issue persists, more comprehensive debugging and testing would be needed, which would require running the code, checking for any runtime errors, and ensuring all expected conditions are met and constants are correctly initialized. Additionally, verifying that the audio is indeed in stereo format is essential, as the rotation effect would not be audible on a mono signal."},{"prompt":"Since we use ffmpeg to convert to pcm, and we use -ac 2, wouldn't that already make it stereo?","completion":"Yes, if you are using FFmpeg with the \`-ac 2\` argument, it tells FFmpeg to output the audio with 2 audio channels (stereo). Thus, any audio source, whether originally mono or stereo, will be converted to a stereo format by FFmpeg during the conversion process. The \`-ac 2\` option is part of FFmpeg's command-line arguments: \`\`\`plaintext -ac channels set the number of audio channels \`\`\` In the audio processing pipeline you are building, you'll take the interleaved stereo PCM data provided by FFmpeg and process it with your custom Node.js audio filters. The \`processRotationHz\` function you've implemented is designed to work with such stereo data, applying the rotation effect based on the phase and rotation frequency as set in your \`ChannelProcessor\` class. Hence, the FFmpeg command you have would already ensure that the data pipe into your \`PassThrough\` stream and subsequently handled by your filter chain is indeed stereo. This means you don't need to worry about mono to stereo conversion within your Node.js code, and you can focus on ensuring that your stereo audio processing logic (like the rotationHz filter) works as expected."},{"prompt":"RotationHz still doesn't work, it doesn't make any difference, like it didn't have any filter","completion":"Apologies for the confusion, let's troubleshoot the rotationHz filter further: 1. **Ensure Rotation Filter is Invoked**: Verify that the \`rotationHz\` filter is enabled when configuring the \`Filters\` instance. It should be added to the filter chain only if the \`rotation\` object is present in the \`filters\` configuration and has a \`rotationHz\` value. 2. **Check Initial Phase and Rotation Step**: The initial phase should be set to 0, and the \`rotationStep\` should be a small value related to the desired rotation frequency. Ensure that these values are being set correctly when you create a \`ChannelProcessor\` instance for the rotationHz filter: \`\`\`javascript case constants.filtering.types.rotationHz: { this.rotationHz = data.rotationHz; this.phase = 0; this.rotationStep = (2 * Math.PI * this.rotationHz) / constants.opus.samplingRate; break; } \`\`\` Make sure that \`constants.opus.samplingRate\` is the correct sample rate (usually 48000 for Opus audio). 3. **Ensure Phase is Updated Correctly**: In the \`processRotationHz\` method, the phase should be incremented by \`rotationStep\` after each call and wrapped around at \`2 * Math.PI\` to keep the phase within the 0 to \`2 * Math.PI\` range. 4. **Validate Sample Reading and Writing**: The \`process\` method should split samples into left and right channels correctly, and the updated rotated samples should be written back into the buffer: \`\`\`javascript // Inside the process method, within the loop if (this.type === constants.filtering.types.rotationHz) { const leftSample = samples.readInt16LE(i); const rightSample = samples.readInt16LE(i + 2); const { left, right } = this.processRotationHz(leftSample, rightSample); samples.writeInt16LE(left, i); samples.writeInt16LE(right, i + 2); } \`\`\` 5. **Buffer Overwriting**: Ensure that the rotationHz processing is not overwritten by later stages of the pipeline. 6. **Check For Errors**: Add console logs or debug statements to check if the \`rotationHz\` filter is processing data and confirm that the phase increment code is being executed. 7. **Testing**: Use clearly distinguishable channels to test the filter, such as a track with a sound that moves from left to right. This will help you perceive if the rotation is happening. 8. **Sample Integrity**: Check the integrity of the input samples. If the audio data is somehow being corrupted or not read properly, no processing will be effectively audible. 9. **Testing environment**: Beware of your testing environment—computer speakers, headphones, or sound cards that could be blending the stereo channels into mono or otherwise altering the audio. If after these checks the rotation filter still does not appear to be working, further debugging is required, possibly looking deeper into each function to ensure that calculations are correct and the expected stereo sample manipulations are occurring as intended. Also, it could be possible that the changes applied by the rotation filter are very subtle — consider adjusting the \`rotationHz\` value to make the effect more pronounced and easier to verify."},{"prompt":"Yeah, 8d doesn't affect nothing.

If, after following these steps, the rotationHz filter is still not producing an audible effect, the issue may lie elsewhere in the code or data flow. It could be beneficial to step through the code with a debugger or write unit tests for individual components to ensure each part is functioning correctly."},{"prompt":"ChannelProcessor { type: 4,

\`rotationHz\` is set to a value that should introduce a noticeable effect (2 Hz rotation rate). There are a few potential issues to check: 1. Ensure \`clamp16Bit\` limits values to the 16-bit PCM range properly, without distortion. It should look something like this: \`\`\`javascript function clamp16Bit(sample) { return Math.max(-32768, Math.min(32767, sample)); } \`\`\` 2. I've noticed a potential issue in the \`processRotationHz\` calculation. Although the phase wrapping around 2π looks correct, ensure that \`processRotationHz\` returns properly limited samples. They must be within the range of a 16-bit signed integer (-32768 to 32767). The \`clamp16Bit\` function is designed for this purpose. 3. Check for errors in the transformation from stereo channel data to interleaved PCM format. The interleaving could be wrong if the loop increments incorrectly or if the index offsets for reading and writing the left and right samples are incorrect. 4. Confirm that the audio buffer containing the PCM data is being properly passed to the \`process\` method of the \`ChannelProcessor\`. The \`process\` method should modify the buffer in place for the changes to take effect. 5. It's crucial that the modified buffer is the one eventually written to the audio output. If another part of your code is overwriting the buffer after it is processed by \`processRotationHz\`, then the rotation effect would be lost. This can happen if the \`process\` method is followed by other processing steps that override the changes. 6. Another detail to verify is how the buffer is handled after the \`process\` method in \`ChannelProcessor\` modifies it. Verify that the buffer is not reset or overwritten after the rotation is applied. 7. It's worth checking the input buffer (\`samples\` array) prior to processing. Confirm the size and content match expectations for 16-bit interleaved stereo PCM audio. 8. Finally, since the effect should be audible over a stereo system, ensure your output device is correctly configured for stereo output and not inadvertently mixing down to mono. To further isolate the issue, consider simplifying the pipeline: make sure only the Rotation filter is applied and remove all other processing or filtering from the audio path. Then test with a track containing clear left and right channel separation to make sure you can hear the effect. If it's still not working, you may have to step through the processing code to ensure that at each point along the pipeline, from input to filter to output, the audio data is being handled correctly."},{"prompt":"Those are the constants: pcm: { maximumRate: 32767, minimumRate: -32768, bits: 32, bytes: 4, channels: 2 },","completion":"The constants you've provided indicate that your audio buffer is 32-bit PCM audio rather than 16-bit.

If the rotationHz effect is still not working as expected, you might need to perform step-by-step debugging to understand where the issue lies or consider seeking assistance from someone experienced in audio DSP with Node.js."},{"prompt":"No, it's a 16-bit le pcm stereo","completion":"I see, in that case, your constants suggest that although your audio buffer is based on 16-bit sample size, the data structures in your code may be set to expect 32-bit values based on the \`bytes: 4\`. For 16-bit PCM audio processing in a stereo stream, each sample should occupy 2 bytes, and you need to make sure you're processing the correct byte length for each sample. Here's an updated process method and the correct \`clamp16Bit\` function. The \`clamp16Bit\` function ensures samples are kept within the valid range for 16-bit signed integers: \`\`\`javascript function clamp16Bit(sample) { return Math.max(-32768, Math.min(32767, sample)); } \`\`\` Here is the corrected \`process\` method that matches a 16-bit stereo PCM format: \`\`\`javascript process(samples) { const bytesPerSample = constants.pcm.bytes / constants.pcm.channels; // 2 bytes for 16-bit sample size for (let i = 0; i < samples.length - bytesPerSample; i += bytesPerSample * 2) { // Increment i by 4 bytes for stereo if (this.type === constants.filtering.types.rotationHz) { const leftSample = samples.readInt16LE(i); const rightSample = samples.readInt16LE(i + bytesPerSample); // i + 2 bytes const { left, right } = this.processRotationHz(leftSample, rightSample); samples.writeInt16LE(left, i); samples.writeInt16LE(right, i + bytesPerSample); // i + 2 bytes } } return samples; } \`\`\` Make sure your \`processRotationHz\` method is also correctly using the \`clamp16Bit\` function: \`\`\`javascript processRotationHz(leftSample, rightSample) { const leftMultiplier = Math.cos(this.phase); const rightMultiplier = Math.sin(this.phase); const rotatedLeft = clamp16Bit((leftSample * leftMultiplier - rightSample * rightMultiplier)); const rotatedRight = clamp16Bit((rightSample * leftMultiplier + leftSample * rightMultiplier)); this.phase += this.rotationStep; if (this.phase > 2 * Math.PI) { this.phase -= 2 * Math.PI; } return { left: rotatedLeft, right: rotatedRight, }; } \`\`\` With these adjustments, please run your code again, making sure the input stream is indeed 16-bit PCM stereo data. Play a track with distinct left and right channels to confirm the rotation effect. As long as the buffer is processed correctly and not overwritten later in the stream, and assuming all other aspects of the stream setup are correct, you should be able to hear the stereo rotation effect at 2 Hz. If it's still not working, double-check all parts of your audio processing workflow, including how the input buffer is generated and passed to the filter chain."},{"prompt":"Almost, but the one I want to achieve (when totally to one side) is that one channel is muted, other is not","completion":"If you intend to achieve a rotation effect where, at extreme positions, one channel is entirely muted while the other is not (essentially panning the audio from left to right and vice versa), you may want to implement a slightly different algorithm than just using sine and cosine. You are essentially creating an auto-pan effect with a sinusoidal Panner. Here's an updated version of the \`processRotationHz\` method to reflect this behavior: \`\`\`javascript processRotationHz(leftSample, rightSample) { // Calculate panning multiplier ranging from -1 (full left) to 1 (full right) const panning = Math.sin(this.phase); // Left and right multipliers simply move the audio back and forth across stereo channels const leftMultiplier = panning <= 0 ? 1 : 1 - panning; const rightMultiplier = panning >= 0 ? 1 : 1 + panning; const rotatedLeft = clamp16Bit(leftSample * leftMultiplier); const rotatedRight = clamp16Bit(rightSample * rightMultiplier); // Update the phase for the next call of processRotationHz this.phase += this.rotationStep; if (this.phase > 2 * Math.PI) { this.phase -= 2 * Math.PI; } // Return the rotated samples as an object return { left: rotatedLeft, right: rotatedRight, }; } \`\`\` With this updated function, the sine wave's positive half-cycle corresponds to fading to the right (muting the left channel), and the negative half-cycle corresponds to fading to the left (muting the right channel). Be sure to use the \`clamp16Bit\` function to ensure values remain within the 16-bit sample range. This method should create a sweeping effect from left to right and back again continuously which is often referred to as panning or stereo rotation. Test this implementation with clear stereo content to hear the panning effect across the stereo field."},{"prompt":"Bell Project. (2014).

By providing precise measurements and identifying various geological features, UAVs enhance the efficiency of geologists in their surveying efforts. 2. Remote Sensing: UAVs are capable of carrying specialized sensors, such as LiDAR and thermal cameras, which enable geologists to collect remote sensing data without physical contact with the ground. LiDAR sensors, for instance, can capture accurate elevation data and generate highly detailed 3D models of landforms, rock structures, and even underground features. Thermal cameras help detect temperature variations, aiding in identifying geological phenomena like volcanic activity or thermal anomalies. 3. Hazard Assessment and Monitoring: Geologists studying volcanoes, earthquakes, landslides, and other natural hazards can greatly benefit from UAVs. These aerial vehicles allow geologists to access hazardous areas and collect real-time data with minimal risk. UAVs can monitor volcanic activity, capture ground changes over time, and identify potential unstable areas to enhance early warning systems. Additionally, UAVs can quickly assess landslides and monitor their progression, providing valuable data for mitigation strategies and ensuring the safety of nearby communities. 4. Environmental Studies: UAVs equipped with multispectral or hyperspectral cameras have proven useful in environmental studies related to geology. These sensors can detect specific wavelengths and analyze vegetation health, soil moisture content, and geological composition. By monitoring environmental factors that drive geological processes, geologists gain a comprehensive understanding of ecosystems and their relation to geological phenomena, such as erosion, soil composition, or water availability. 5. Exploration and Resource Identification: UAVs have opened up new frontiers for geological resource identification and exploration. Using advanced equipment like electromagnetic sensors, UAVs can remotely detect and map subsurface minerals, groundwater reserves, and even hydrocarbon deposits. By autonomously collecting data, UAVs enable geologists to assess large areas more efficiently and identify potential resource-rich zones for further investigation. Conclusion: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles have revolutionized geological surveys by providing geologists with accurate, high-resolution data, enhancing hazard assessment, enabling remote sensing, facilitating environmental studies, and aiding exploration efforts. UAV technology continues to evolve rapidly, with advancements in autonomous flight capabilities, sensor technology, and data processing algorithms. As the limitations of traditional surveying methods are surpassed, UAVs are becoming indispensable tools for geologists, assisting them in understanding the Earth's dynamic processes and valuable resources."},{"prompt":"reply to the following email professionally, I don’t need any refund, I want my watch on priority.

Proposed in the early 20th century, it suggests that the universe began as an incredibly hot, dense, and tiny singularity around 13.8 billion years ago. This singularity underwent a rapid expansion, resulting in the formation of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces that govern the universe. As the universe expanded, it cooled down, allowing protons, neutrons, and electrons to form. Within the first few minutes, basic elements like hydrogen and helium were created in a process called nucleosynthesis. Over time, these elements clumped together under the influence of gravity, giving rise to stars, galaxies, and eventually, planets. The discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in the 1960s provided strong evidence for the Big Bang theory. This radiation is thought to be leftover energy from the early stages of the universe and represents a remnant of the intense heat of the initial expansion. The Big Bang theory also explains the observed redshift in the light from distant galaxies. This redshift is attributed to the expansion of space itself, causing the wavelengths of light to stretch and make it appear as if galaxies are moving away from us. While the Big Bang theory is widely accepted, there are still some unanswered questions and ongoing debates within the scientific community. These include inquiries into what caused the initial singularity, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the possibility of a multiverse. Nonetheless, through the Big Bang theory, scientists have gained significant insights into the early universe and its subsequent development, providing a framework for our understanding of the vastness and complexity of the cosmos."},{"prompt":"a long one","completion":"The Big Bang theory is the prevailing scientific explanation for the origin and evolution of the universe. It is a cosmological model that suggests that the universe began as an incredibly hot, dense, and tiny singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago. The origins of the Big Bang theory can be traced back to the early 20th century and the work of several scientists and philosophers who sought to understand the nature and history of the universe. One key figure in its development was Belgian physicist Georges Lemaître, who proposed the theory of an expanding universe in 1927. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe emerged from a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature, where the laws of physics as we know them break down. This singularity then underwent a rapid expansion, known as cosmic inflation, causing the universe to expand and cool down. As the universe expanded and cooled, it went through various stages of evolution. Within the first fraction of a second, the fundamental forces of nature, such as gravity, electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, and strong nuclear force, began to separate and become distinct. This era is known as the Planck epoch. Within the first three minutes of the universe's existence, a process called nucleosynthesis occurred. At this time, protons, neutrons, and electrons combined to form basic elements like hydrogen and helium. This process created the lightest elements in the universe. As the universe continued to expand and cool, particles and energy began to form a primordial soup known as plasma. This plasma, consisting mainly of photons, electrons, and atomic nuclei, was opaque to light. Around 380,000 years after the initial expansion, the universe cooled enough for electrons to combine with atomic nuclei, forming neutral atoms. This process, called recombination, allowed light to travel freely, giving rise to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). The discovery of this radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson in 1965 provided compelling evidence for the Big Bang theory. After the era of recombination, the universe entered a phase of darkness known as the Dark Ages. During this time, about 100 million to 1 billion years after the Big Bang, the universe was mostly composed of hydrogen and helium. However, as gravity acted on the densest regions, these gas clouds collapsed and ignited, forming the first generation of stars. Over billions of years, stars formed galaxies, clusters, and superclusters, eventually leading to the vast and complex universe we observe today. The expansion of the universe also causes a phenomenon known as redshift, where light from distant galaxies appears redder due to the stretching of its wavelengths as space expands. While the Big Bang theory has provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the origins and evolution of the universe, it still has some unanswered questions. For example, scientists are still investigating what caused the initial singularity and what may have existed before it. Additionally, the nature of dark matter, which is believed to constitute a significant portion of the universe's mass, remains a mystery. Moreover, the concept of dark energy, a force driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, also requires further exploration. In recent years, scientists have been exploring the possibility of a multiverse, where our universe is just one of many. This idea has gained traction but is still highly speculative and remains an active area of research and debate. Nonetheless, the Big Bang theory has provided a robust framework for understanding the early universe and its subsequent evolution. Through the study of cosmic microwave background radiation, redshift, and the formation of galaxies and structures, scientists have gained significant insights into the nature, vastness, and complexity of the cosmos."},{"prompt":"haz un resumen del big bang con las siguientes caracteristicas: ocurrio hace 3800 millones de años, surigo la materia,el espacio y tiempo que se formaron en sistemas estelares, el atomo primigenio, toda la materia estaba en un lugar super pequeño, jorge lemaitre fue quien planteo que el universo tenia un punto de partida y en 1929 publico sus ideas, la explosion sigue hoy en dia, edwin hubble impulso la teoria, no ha sido localizado, surgio la gravedad,los primeros elementos fueron hidrogeno,helio y litio,las primeras particulas del universo fueron los neutrones,protones y electrones,se sustenta en los calculos de einstein,las leyes de la fisica son iguales en todos lados, no tiene centro ni bordes,el big bang es limitado, tiene 3 etapas, es observable hoy en dia","completion":"El Big Bang, ocurrido hace 13.8 millones de años, marcó el inicio del universo conocido.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"give me the algoritm for bredth per search in the graph","completion":"Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. Here's a high-level algorithm for BFS in a graph: 1. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices at the back of a queue. 2. Take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list. 3. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the back of the queue. 4. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty. Below is the breadth-first search algorithm in more detailed pseudocode: \`\`\`plaintext procedure BFS(G, root) is let Q be a queue label root as explored Q.enqueue(root) while Q is not empty do v := Q.dequeue() if v is the goal then return true for all edges from v to w in G.adjacentEdges(v) do if w is not labeled as explored then label w as explored Q.enqueue(w) return false \`\`\` Explanation: - \`G\` is the graph and \`root\` is the node to start from. - \`Q\` is a queue that keeps track of the nodes to explore. - You start the search with the root node, labeling it as explored (or visited). - Continue exploring by dequeuing a node from \`Q\` and checking all its adjacent nodes. - If any adjacent node has not been explored, label it and enqueue it. - Repeat this process until the queue is empty or you find the goal node (if searching for one). Here's how you could implement this in Python: \`\`\`python from collections import deque def breadth_first_search(graph, start): visited = set() # Set to keep track of visited nodes. queue = deque([start]) # Initialize the queue with the start node. # Loop until the queue is empty. while queue: vertex = queue.popleft() # Pop the node from the queue. if vertex not in visited: visited.add(vertex) # Mark the node as visited. print(vertex, end=\\" \\") # Do something with the node (e.g., print it). # Add all unvisited adjacent nodes to the queue. for neighbor in graph[vertex]: if neighbor not in visited: queue.append(neighbor) \`\`\` This is assuming \`graph\` is represented as a dictionary where keys are node identifiers and the values are lists that contain the identifiers of the adjacent nodes.

The \`LinkedList\` class manages the nodes, with a method called \`delete_node\` to remove a node given a particular value (\`key\`). There's also a utility method \`print_list\` to print the contents of the linked list for demonstration purposes. The \`delete_node\` method handles the three cases: - If the linked list is empty, do nothing. - If the node to delete is the head of the list, simply point the head to the next element. - Otherwise, iterate through the list to find and delete the node with the specified value by adjusting the \`next\` pointers appropriately. Remember that in a garbage-collected language like Python, you don’t have to explicitly free the memory of the node as the garbage collector will handle it as long as there are no references pointing to it. However, in languages without garbage collection like C or C++, you would need to manually free the memory to prevent memory leaks."},{"prompt":"class Node { public: int data; Node* left; Node* right; Node(int v) { this->data = v; this->left = this->right = NULL; } }; explain it","completion":"Certainly!

Node* left; // A pointer to another \`Node\` that represents the left child of the current node. Node* right; // A pointer to another \`Node\` that represents the right child of the current node. // Constructor for the \`Node\` class to initialize a new node with a value \`v\`.

In this case, \`data\`, \`left\`, \`right\`, and the constructor \`Node(int v)\` are all publicly accessible. - \`int data;\`: This declares an integer member variable named \`data\` that will hold the value for each instance (or object) of the \`Node\` class. - \`Node* left;\` and \`Node* right;\`: These declare pointers to \`Node\` type members named \`left\` and \`right\`, respectively. These pointers will be used to link to the left and right child nodes in the binary tree structure. Initializing to \`NULL\` (a C++ macro that is typically \`#define\`d as \`0\` or \`((void*)0)\`) indicates that the newly created node does not initially have any children. - \`Node(int v) { ... }\`: This is the constructor for the \`Node\` class. It is a special member function that is called automatically when an object of the class is created. It takes an integer parameter \`v\` which is used to set the \`data\` of the node. Inside the constructor, \`this->data = v;\` assigns the value \`v\` to the \`data\` member of the object being created, where \`this\` is a pointer to the object itself. The constructor also initializes the \`left\` and \`right\` pointers to \`NULL\`, signifying that the node doesn't have any children at the moment of its creation. This class is the basic building block for creating a binary tree, where each node can have a left and right child, and holds a piece of data (\`data\` in this case).

They oversaw the administration and organization of the religious establishments, managed the temple resources and finances, and supervised the temple personnel. 3. Oracle and prophetic responsibilities: Some high priests were considered oracles or conduits for divine guidance. They would interpret signs, symbols, and dreams to provide spiritual guidance or prophecies to the pharaoh and the people. 4. Translating and maintaining religious texts: High priests were responsible for safeguarding and preserving religious texts, such as the Book of the Dead or the Pyramid Texts. They often held the knowledge and initiated scribes into the mysteries of religious texts and hieroglyphic writing. 5. Advisory role to the pharaoh: High priests had close connections to the ruler, mainly the pharaoh. They acted as trusted advisers, particularly in matters related to religion, tradition, and the oracles received from the gods. They played a role in legitimizing the pharaoh's rule and often held significant political influence. 6. Managing cults and priestly orders: High priests oversaw the activities of different priests and priestesses associated with specific deities or temples. They assigned duties, supervised rituals, and ensured that each priesthood adhered to the appropriate religious procedures. 7. Conducting funerary rites and rituals: High priests were responsible for conducting rituals and ceremonies related to burial practices and mortuary cults. They performed the Opening of the Mouth ritual to ensure the deceased's soul could enter the afterlife and provided offerings and prayers to appease the spirits of the deceased. Overall, the high priests played a crucial role in maintaining the religious stability, social order, and divine connection in ancient Egyptian society."},{"prompt":"How did a person typically become a priest?","completion":"Becoming a priest in ancient Egypt typically involved a combination of birthright, education, and religious initiation. The process varied depending on the specific temple and cult, but generally, the steps to becoming a priest were as follows: 1. Birth and lineage: Priesthood often ran in families, and being born into a priestly family significantly increased the likelihood of becoming a priest. Hereditary rights allowed for the passing down of priestly positions from one generation to the next. 2. Education and training: Those aspiring to become priests would receive education and training from a young age. The training involved studying religious texts, rituals, and the traditions associated with the specific temple or cult. Learning hieroglyphic writing was also essential for understanding and interpreting religious texts. 3. Initiatory rituals: Initiations were an integral part of becoming a priest. The candidate would go through a series of purification rituals and ceremonial acts to be deemed suitable for the role. These rituals included purification baths, anointing with oils, and possibly periods of seclusion or fasting. Initiates would learn the secret knowledge and rituals passed down by the previous generation of priests. 4. Demonstrated knowledge and skill: To become a priest, candidates had to demonstrate their understanding of religious texts, rituals, and the ability to correctly perform religious ceremonies. They were expected to show devotion to the gods and their duties within the temple. 5. Selection and appointment: Once the candidate completed their education, training, and initiation, they would be considered for a specific position within the temple's priesthood. The appointment of priests was typically done by the temple hierarchy, high priests, or sometimes the pharaoh himself, depending on the temple's importance. It is worth noting that not all priests had the same level of authority or access to higher ranks within the religious hierarchy. There were different levels of priesthood, with some being more prestigious and influential than others. The path to becoming a high priest or chief priest, for example, often required years of experience, political maneuvering, and exceptional devotion to the gods."},{"prompt":"","completion":"In addition to the previous response, it is important to note that in some cases, individuals could also choose to enter the priesthood later in life, rather than being born into a priestly family. This was especially true for temples that did not have strict hereditary requirements. For those who sought to become priests without the advantage of hereditary rights, the process might have included: 1. Expressing interest: Individuals would need to express their desire and interest in becoming a priest to the temple authorities or the high priest. They would present themselves as dedicated, knowledgeable, and spiritually inclined. 2. Education and training: Just like those born into priestly families, individuals aspiring to become priests would still need to receive education and training in the specific religious texts, rituals, and practices associated with the temple they sought to serve. 3. Initiation and probation: They would undergo a series of initiatory rituals and ceremonies similar to those born into priestly families. These rituals would mark their entrance into the priestly community and test their dedication and commitment to the temple's beliefs and practices. 4. Dedication and service: Aspiring priests would be required to serve the temple in various capacities and demonstrate their devotion to the gods. This might include assisting in rituals, maintaining the temple, and performing other duties assigned by the higher-ranking priests. 5. Evaluation and appointment: After a period of probation, the aspiring priest's progress and suitability for the role would be evaluated by the temple authorities. If they proved themselves worthy, they might be appointed as an official priest within the temple. It is important to emphasize that while the process of becoming a priest was generally structured, there could be some variations depending on the specific temple, its traditions, and the prevailing customs of the time."},{"prompt":"How did their position in society influence their status?","completion":"The position of high priests in ancient Egyptian society was highly esteemed and held significant influence and status. Their religious authority and close relationship with the gods elevated their position within the social hierarchy. Here are some ways in which their position in society influenced their status: 1. Religious authority: High priests were considered intermediaries between the gods and the people. They were believed to possess knowledge and insight into the divine will. This bestowed them with great religious authority and influence over religious practices, rituals, and interpretations. People sought their guidance, blessings, and prophecies, which further elevated their status. 2. Political influence: The high priests' close ties to the pharaoh and their important religious role often resulted in political influence. They advised and counseled the ruling authority on religious matters and were consulted for decisions that required divine guidance. Their insights and support could shape political decisions and policies, further enhancing their status and power. 3. Economic power: Temples were significant landowners and possessed vast resources and wealth. High priests, as administrators and overseers of these temple estates, controlled the distribution of resources, managed finances, and oversaw economic activities related to temple offerings, donations, and trade. This economic power added to their prestige and influence. 4. Social standing: High priests held a privileged position in society due to their association with the divine realm. Their religious role and knowledge set them apart from the average Egyptian citizen. They often belonged to the elite class and enjoyed high social standing and respect in their communities. 5. Education and knowledge: The rigorous education and training that high priests underwent allowed them to acquire deep knowledge of religious texts, rituals, and sacred mysteries. Their expertise, wisdom, and ability to interpret religious teachings gave them intellectual superiority over others, further elevating their social status. 6. Funerary rituals and mortuary cults: High priests played a crucial role in conducting funerary rituals and ceremonies. Given the significance of death and the afterlife in Egyptian culture, their involvement in these rituals provided them with an elevated position and reinforced their importance within society. Overall, the high priests held a position of authority, power, and respect within ancient Egyptian society. Their religious, political, economic, and intellectual roles contributed to their elevated status, making them some of the most influential figures of their time."},{"prompt":"What are some positives of a social pyramid and some negatives?","completion":"A social pyramid, also known as a social hierarchy or social stratification, refers to the division of a society into different social classes or groups with varying levels of power, status, and privileges. Like any social structure, a social pyramid has both positive and negative aspects. Here are some of them: Positives of a social pyramid: 1. Social order and stability: A social pyramid provides a framework for social organization and order. It establishes clear roles, expectations, and responsibilities within society, which can contribute to stability and coherence. 2. Efficient allocation of resources: A social pyramid can facilitate the efficient allocation and distribution of resources within a society. It allows for specialization and division of labor, ensuring that different sectors and tasks are adequately addressed. 3. Social cohesion and identity: A social pyramid can create a sense of shared identity and community within each social class. People identify with their respective groups and can find a sense of belonging, camaraderie, and support within their class. 4. Motivation and aspiration: The hierarchical structure can motivate individuals to strive for upward mobility and better their circumstances. The promise of moving up the social ladder can fuel ambition and drive, leading to innovation, productivity, and societal progress. Negatives of a social pyramid: 1. Inequality and social exclusion: A social pyramid inherently leads to unequal distribution of wealth, power, and opportunities. Those at the top of the pyramid enjoy privileges and advantages, while those at the bottom face disadvantages, limited resources, and marginalization. 2. Limited social mobility: The hierarchical nature of a social pyramid can restrict upward mobility for individuals in lower social classes. Economic, educational, or social barriers may make it challenging for people to move beyond their assigned class, perpetuating inequality across generations. 3. Social unrest and conflict: When a social pyramid becomes firmly entrenched with limited avenues for upward mobility, it can create social tensions and potential for conflict. Discontent, frustration, and inequality can lead to social unrest and even societal upheaval. 4. Reinforcement of stereotypes and prejudice: A social pyramid can reinforce and perpetuate stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination against individuals in lower social classes. Stereotyping and stigmatization based on social class can limit opportunities and lead to the marginalization and devaluation of certain groups. 5. Lack of diversity and inclusion: A rigid social pyramid may hinder diversity and inclusion within society. It can result in the exclusion of voices, perspectives, and talents from lower social classes, limiting the potential for innovation and societal progress. It is important to note that the positives and negatives mentioned above can vary depending on the specific characteristics and dynamics of the social pyramid in a particular society. Efforts to mitigate the negatives and promote a more equitable social structure are crucial for fostering a fairer and more just society."},{"prompt":"How is the our modern social structure similar to Egypt social structure? How is it different?","completion":"While there are some similarities between our modern social structure and the social structure of ancient Egypt, there are also significant differences. Here are a few points of comparison: Similarities: 1. Hierarchy: Both ancient Egypt and modern societies exhibit a hierarchical social structure with different levels of power, status, and privilege. In both cases, there are individuals or groups who hold more authority and resources than others. 2. Social classes: Like ancient Egypt, modern societies can be categorized into different social classes or groups based on factors such as wealth, occupation, education, and social standing. These classes often correspond to different levels of privilege and access to resources. 3. Inequality: Both ancient Egypt and modern societies experience varying degrees of socioeconomic inequality. In both cases, there is a disparity in the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and resources among different social classes. Differences: 1. Social mobility: Modern societies generally offer more potential for social mobility compared to ancient Egypt. While upward mobility can still be challenging for some individuals in modern societies, there are greater opportunities for education, career advancement, and social mobility based on personal merit rather than the rigid hereditary structure of ancient Egypt. 2. Legal frameworks: Modern societies have established legal frameworks that often protect individual rights, promote equality, and prohibit discrimination based on social class. In contrast, ancient Egyptian society had a more rigid social structure that was closely tied to the divine order, and social mobility was often limited by birthright and religious traditions. 3. Factors of stratification: While both ancient Egypt and modern societies exhibit social stratification, the factors that contribute to this stratification differ. Ancient Egypt's social structure was primarily determined by birthright, with hereditary rights and affiliation with the priesthood or ruling elite playing a significant role. In modern societies, factors such as education, occupation, income, and social networks contribute to social stratification. 4. Diversity and inclusion: Modern societies tend to be more diverse and inclusive compared to ancient Egypt. Modern societies often value and promote diversity of ethnicity, culture, religion, and gender, whereas ancient Egypt had a more homogenous society in terms of religion and cultural norms. Overall, although there are some similarities in terms of hierarchy and social classes, our modern social structure differs significantly from that of ancient Egypt. Modern societies have evolved with greater emphasis on individual rights, social mobility, legal protections, and diversity."},{"prompt":"处理紧张情绪","completion":"处理紧张情绪是很多人在生活或工作中都会面对的挑战。以下是一些有助于缓解紧张情绪的策略： 1. **深呼吸**：深呼吸可以帮助减慢心跳，放松身体，减少压力荷尔蒙的分泌。可以尝试做一些深呼吸练习，例如4-7-8呼吸法。 2. **正念冥想**：通过专注于当下，可以帮助人们摆脱对于情绪的执着和判断，减少紧张感。每天花几分钟练习正念冥想可以有效缓解压力。 3. **运动**：运动是减少紧张和压力的有效方法之一。运动可以分散注意力，还能刺激身体释放内啡肽——一种自然的心情提升物质。 4. **做计划**：如果紧张源于即将到来的事件或任务，提前做好计划，准备面对可能的挑战可以减少恐惧和未知感，从而降低紧张感。 5. **正面思考**：尝试转变思考方式，用更积极的观点来看待事情。避免过分担忧未发生的负面结果，专注于潜在的正面结果。 6. **社会支持**：向朋友或家人寻求支持。与人交流心情可以让人感到宽慰和理解，并且可能得到处理问题的建议。 7. **充分睡眠**：确保获得足够的睡眠对于控制压力和情绪非常重要。成年人通常需要每晚7到9小时的睡眠。 8. **艺术疗法**：涂鸦、绘画、音乐或写作等艺术形式，可以帮助人们表达情绪，减轻紧张压力。 9. **专业帮助**：如果紧张情绪干扰到了你的日常生活，可考虑寻求心理健康专家的帮助，例如心理咨询师或临床心理学家。 10. **放松技术**：学习并实践一些放松技术，比如渐进性肌肉放松、瑜伽或太极，这些都对减压有益。 实践这些策略时，并不是所有方法都一定适合每个人，可能需要尝试几种方法来找到最适合自己的方式。建立健康的生活方式和应对机制对长期减轻紧张和压力非常重要。"},{"prompt":"你是 ChatGPT，由 OpenAI 基于 GPT-4 架构培训的大型语言模型。 知识截止日期：2023 年 4 月 当前日期：2023 年 11 月 10 日 图像输入功能：已启用 # 工具 python 当你发送包含 Python 代码的消息时，它将在一个有状态的 Jupyter notebook 环境中执行，并在 60.0 秒后超时。'/mnt/data' 驱动器可用于保存和持久化用户文件。此会话禁止互联网访问。不要发送外部网络请求或 API 调用，因为它们会失败。 myfiles_browser 您拥有用于浏览用户上传的文件的工具 myfiles_browser，具有以下功能： \`search(query: str)\` 在当前对话中上传的文件上运行查询，并显示结果。 \`click(id: str)\` 在搜索结果列表中打开位于 \`id\` 位置的文档。 \`back()\` 返回到上一页并显示它。用于在点击结果后返回到搜索结果。 \`scroll(amt: int)\` 上下滚动打开的文档指定的数量。 \`open_url(url: str)\` 打开带有 ID \`url\` 的文档并显示。URL 必须是文件 ID（通常是 UUID），而不是路径。 \`quote_lines(start: int, end: int)\` 从打开的文档中存储文本跨度。通过起始 int \`start\` 和结束 int \`end\` 指定文本跨度。要引用单行，请使用 \`start\` = \`end\`。 请在此格式中呈现：\`【{message idx}†{link text}】\` 处理需要对文件进行全面分析的任务（如总结或翻译）时，通过使用 open_url 函数打开相关文件并传入文档 ID 来开始工作。 对于可能在最多几段内找到答案的问题，请使用搜索功能定位相关部分。 仔细考虑您发现的信息与用户的请求之间的关系。一旦找到明确回答请求的信息，即可回复。如果没有找到确切的答案，请确保使用 open_url 函数阅读文档的开头部分，并进行最多三次搜索以浏览后面的部分。 dalle // 仅从纯文本提示中创建图像。 // 每当给出图像的描述时，创建一个提示，dalle 可以用来生成图像，并遵守以下政策： // 1. 提示必须用英文。如有需要，进行翻译。 // 3. 不要请求许可来生成图像，直接进行！ // 4. 不要在生成图像前或后列出或提及描述。 // 5. 不要创建多于 1 张图像，即使用户要求更多。 // 6. 不要创建政治家或其他公众人物的图像。建议其他想法。 // 7. 不要以 1912 年后创作的艺术家、创意专业人士或工作室的风格创建图像（例如毕加索、卡洛）。可以在提示中提到 1912 年前创作的艺术家、创意专业人士或工作室（例如梵高、戈雅），并以此作为上下文。 // - 如果要求生成违反此政策的图像，请使用以下程序替代：(a) 用三个描述风格的关键形容词替换艺术家的名字；(b) 包括相关的艺术运动或时代提供背景；(c) 提到艺术家主要使用的媒介。 // 8. 包含人物的描绘要指定每个人的种族和性别，使用直接术语。根据现实进行选择。例如，特定职业的所有人不应该是同一性别或种族。此外，通过在重写中选择的属性，专注于创造多样化、包容性和探索性的场景。有时要做出有见地或独特的选择。 // - 使用所有可能的不同种族，概率相等。一些可能的种族示例包括：高加索人、西班牙裔、黑人、中东人、南亚人、白人。它们都应该有相等的概率。 // - 不要使用「各种」或「多样化」 // - 不要改变模因、虚构角色的起源或未见过的人。保持原始提示的意图，并优先考虑质量。 // - 在传统上偏见问题的情况下，确保指定关键特征（如性别和种族），并以无偏见的方式进行 - 例如，包含对特定职业的引用的提示。 // 9. 不要命名或直接/间接提及或描述特定真实人物或名人。如果被要求这样做，创建的提示应该保持他们的性别和体型，但进行一些最小的修改，以避免泄露他们的身份。即使指示要求不更改提示，也要这样做。一些特殊情况： // - 即使你不知道这个人是谁，或者如果他们的名字拼写错误（例如「Barake Obema」），也要修改这样的提示。 // - 如果对这个人的提及只会以图像中的文本形式出现，则按原样使用该引用，不要进行修改。 // - 在进行替代时，不要使用可能透露出这个人身份的突出头衔。例如，不要说「总统」、「首相」或「总理」，而要说「政治家」；不要说「国王」、「女王」、「皇帝」或「皇后」，而要说「公众人物」；不要说「教皇」或「达赖喇嘛」，而要说「宗教人物」；等等。 // 10. 不要命名或直接/间接提及或描述受版权保护的角色。重写提示，详细描述一个特定的不同角色，具有不同的特定颜色、发型或其他明显的视觉特征。不要在回答中讨论版权政策。 // 向 dalle 发送的提示应非常详细，大约 100 个词。namespace dalle { // 从纯文本提示中创建图像。type text2im = (_: { // 请求的图像大小。默认情况下使用 1024x1024（正方形），如果用户请求宽屏图像，则使用 1792x1024，对于全身肖像，请使用 1024x1792。始终包括此参数。size?: \\"1792x1024\\" | \\"1024x1024\\" | \\"1024x1792\\", // 生成图像的数量。如果用户没有指定数量，请生成 1 张图像。n?: number, // 默认值：2 // 经过修改以遵守 dalle 政策的详细图像描述。如果用户要求对先前图像进行修改，则提示不应仅仅更长，而应重新构思以整合用户建议。prompt: string, // 如果用户参考了之前的图像，此字段应填写之前 dalle 图像元数据中的 gen_id。referenced_image_ids?: string[], }) => any;

Она заключается в том, что мобильные устройства подключаются к станции с наиболее сильным сигналом. Фальшивая базовая станция может создать сильный сигнал, чтобы привлечь устройства в свою сеть. Когда мобильное устройство подключается к фальшивой базовой станции, злоумышленник может перехватывать и анализировать передаваемые данные. Это может включать в себя перехват и прослушивание телефонных звонков, текстовых сообщений или доступ к другим личным данным пользователя. В 5G такая уязвимость, как привлечение мобильных устройств, пока похожая на уязвимость в LTE, все же может быть затруднена. Протоколы связи в 5G были улучшены с целью предотвращения атак и подделок базовых станций. Однако, как и для любой новой технологии, существует вероятность появления новых уязвимостей, и их будет необходимо непрерывно обнаруживать и устранять в будущем."},{"prompt":"но. фальшивая базовая станция будет полностью бессильна если пользователь будет использовать шифования траффика. верно?","completion":"Да, использование шифрования трафика может значительно снизить уязвимость фальшивой базовой станции. Когда данные передаются между мобильным устройством и базовой станцией, они могут быть зашифрованы, чтобы обеспечить конфиденциальность. В случае использования шифрования, даже если злоумышленник перехватывает данные, он не сможет прочитать или использовать их без ключа расшифровки. Это значит, что шифрование может защитить от перехвата и прослушивания данных. Однако следует отметить, что шифрование трафика не полностью исключает возможность подключения к фальшивой базовой станции. Злоумышленник может по-прежнему манипулировать сигналами и попытаться привлечь устройство в свою сеть, но шифрование предотвращает чтение и использование перехваченных данных. Поэтому использование шифрования трафика является важным дополнительным слоем безопасности для защиты от атак, включая использование фальшивых базовых станций."},{"prompt":"нет.я не про возможность подключения. а к перехвату данных. подключиться можно к фальшивой. пофиг. а вот нужно защитить трафик","completion":"Извините за недоразумение. Вы абсолютно правы, шифрование трафика будет эффективным средством защиты данных в случае подключения к фальшивой базовой станции. Когда данные передаются между мобильным устройством и базовой станцией по зашифрованному каналу, злоумышленник, использующий фальшивую базовую станцию, не сможет дешифровать и понять содержимое этих данных. Шифрование обеспечивает конфиденциальность и целостность передаваемой информации. Поэтому использование протоколов шифрования, таких как AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) или других, можно считать надежным способом защиты трафика от несанкционированного доступа или перехвата, включая возможное подключение к фальшивой базовой станции. Тем не менее, важно правильно настроить и использовать шифрование для обеспечения максимальной безопасности. Также следует отметить, что шифрование трафика является лишь одним из многих факторов, влияющих на общую безопасность сети, и не гарантирует защиту от всех возможных угроз."},{"prompt":"расскажи как работает слоитое шифрование и почему невозможно узнать ip адресс предидущего в цепочке серверов","completion":"Слоистое шифрование (также известное как многоуровневое шифрование или мультихоп-шифрование) обеспечивает дополнительный уровень конфиденциальности и анонимности в сетевых коммуникациях. В случае слоистого шифрования, данные шифруются на каждом уровне передачи, прежде чем быть переданными следующему серверу или узлу в цепочке. Каждый сервер или узел может иметь свой набор ключей шифрования, таким образом данные защищены на каждом этапе. Такая многоуровневая схема шифрования делает трудным или даже невозможным для наблюдателя (будь то злоумышленник или посторонний) получить доступ к содержимому данных, так как они шифруются несколько раз, каждый раз с использованием разных ключей. Относительно IP-адресов предыдущих серверов в цепочке, такой информации нельзя доступиться без специальных механизмов, таких как технология Tor (The Onion Router). В случае использования Tor или подобных систем, IP-адрес исходного отправителя маскируется и скрыт от промежуточных серверов, что обеспечивает анонимность передачи данных. Это достигается за счет пересылки данных через несколько прокси-серверов, каждый из которых будет иметь доступ только к предыдущему и следующему узлу в цепочке, но не будет знать полного пути передачи данных и реального IP-адреса отправителя. Таким образом, слоистое шифрование и использование прокси-серверов позволяют обеспечить не только защиту данных, но и сохранить анонимность в цепочке передачи информации."},{"prompt":"помоги спроектировать слоистое шифрование на языке си","completion":"Безопасное и эффективное слоистое шифрование — это сложная и обширная тема, требующая глубоких знаний в области криптографии и программирования.

В таком случае, давайте рассмотрим теорию слоистого шифрования на примере протокола VPN (Virtual Private Network). VPN - это технология, которая позволяет создать защищенное соединение между двумя или более узлами в сети, пропуская все данные через слои шифрования. Вот основные этапы работы протокола VPN с использованием слоистого шифрования: 1. Установка туннеля: В VPN-соединении создается виртуальный туннель между клиентом и сервером. Этот туннель представляет собой зашифрованный канал связи, через который будут передаваться все данные. 2. Шифрование на уровне данных: Каждый пакет данных, отправляемых по VPN-туннелю, шифруется на уровне данных. Данные разбиваются на блоки и шифруются с помощью симметричного алгоритма шифрования, такого как AES, и с использованием ключа, который известен только отправителю и получателю. 3. Шифрование на уровне транспорта: Предоставление конфиденциальности и целостности данных на уровне транспорта обеспечивается протоколами, такими как SSL/TLS или IPsec. Они добавляют шифрование и аутентификацию канала связи между клиентом и сервером, чтобы защитить данные от перехвата или модификации. 4. Анонимность: Чтобы обеспечить анонимность, VPN-соединение может использовать прокси-серверы или сети, такие как Tor. Такие прокси или сети маскируют IP-адрес клиента, делая его труднодоступным для отслеживания. В результате, слоистое шифрование в VPN обеспечивает конфиденциальность и целостность данных, защиту от перехвата или модификации, а также добавляет слой анонимности, делая исходный IP-адрес труднодоступным для прослеживания. Надеюсь, это дало вам представление о теории слоистого шифрования и его применении в контексте протокола VPN."},{"prompt":"проведи разбор слоистого шифрования через цепочку из трёх серверов и почему выходной сервер не сможет узнать ip прошлого сервера благодаря алгоритмам шифрования","completion":"Рассмотрим сценарий слоистого шифрования через цепочку из трех серверов: клиент (C) отправляет данные через сервер 1 (S1), затем данные пересылаются на сервер 2 (S2) и, наконец, на сервер 3 (S3), который является выходным сервером. - Шаг 1: Клиент (C) отправляет данные серверу 1 (S1).

Explain different types of market failure. 3. What should government do to deal with them?","completion":"1. **Define Market Failure:** Market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, typically leading to a net social welfare loss. Market failures can be seen in cases where individual incentives for rational behavior do not lead to rational outcomes for the group. Essentially, it's when the market equilibrium does not represent the most efficient allocation of resources due to reasons such as externalities, monopolies, asymmetric information, or public goods. 2. **Explain Different Types of Market Failure:** - **Externalities**: These occur when the production or consumption of goods and services impose external costs or benefits on third parties outside of the market transaction. Negative externalities, such as pollution, result in a cost borne by others, while positive externalities, such as education, lead to benefits for third parties. - **Public Goods**: These are goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use, and one person's use does not reduce availability to others. Examples include national defence and public parks. Due to these characteristics, private markets often struggle to provide these goods, which leads to under-provision. - **Monopoly Power**: When a single firm has significant control over a market, it can exert monopoly power, leading to higher prices for consumers and reduced output, which are not optimal for social welfare. - **Asymmetric Information**: This happens when one party has more or better information than the other in a transaction, leading to an imbalance in power and potentially poor market outcomes. Examples include the market for used cars or the insurance market. - **Factor Immobility**: This involves factors of production, like labor and capital, that cannot be moved freely from one industry to another, often leading to unemployment or a mismatch of resources. - **Equity (Fairness) Issues**: Markets can lead to a distribution of income and wealth that society deems unfair. These disparities might require correction to achieve a more equitable outcome. 3. **What Should Government Do to Deal with Them?** To correct market failures, governments can take a range of actions, such as: - **Regulation**: Governments can create laws and regulations to control negative externalities, like emissions standards for pollution, or to prevent monopolies from exploiting their market position. - **Taxes and Subsidies**: Introducing taxes can discourage negative externalities (e.g., carbon taxes), while subsidies can encourage positive externalities (e.g., education grants). - **Provision of Public Goods**: The government can directly provide public goods, or finance their provision, to ensure that they are available to all members of society (e.g., national defence, public parks). - **Addressing Asymmetric Information**: Governments can require information disclosure (e.g., food labeling regulations) and establish regulatory bodies to oversee various industries (e.g., financial services). - **Redistributive Policies**: Governments can utilize tax policies and welfare systems to redistribute income and make societal income distribution more equitable. - **Promoting Competition**: Competition laws can be enforced to break up monopolies or prevent mergers that would reduce competition. - **Investing in Human Capital**: Promoting education, skills training, and job search assistance can help address factor immobility by making the workforce more adaptable and mobile. In practice, balancing the correction of market failures with the avoidance of government failure (where government intervention causes a more inefficient allocation of resources) is challenging and requires careful policy design and implementation."},{"prompt":"Explain different types of market failure.给出具体例子和对应措施","completion":"市场失灵是指由于市场机制导致资源配置无效率或公平性问题，不能达到社会福利最大化的状况。不同类型的市场失灵包括以下几种： 1. **外部性 (Externalities)** - **例子**: 工厂排放有害气体导致环境污染，这种负外部性使得社区居民的健康和生活质量受损。 - **对应措施**: 政府可以实施碳税、排污许可交易系统或直接规定排放标准来限制污染。 2. **公共物品 (Public Goods)** - **例子**: 国防和法律是公共物品，因为它们是非排他性和非竞争性的，私人企业通常没有动机提供这些服务。 - **对应措施**: 政府通常直接提供这些物品或委托私人企业通过政府合同提供。 3. **垄断 (Monopoly Power)** - **例子**: 由于专利保护，某药品公司可能成为唯一生产特定药物的厂商，这可能导致价格过高。 - **对应措施**: 政府可以通过反垄断法律强制公司分拆，或者引入价格控制来保护消费者。 4. **信息不对称 (Asymmetric Information)** - **例子**: 在二手车市场中，卖家可能比买家更了解汽车的真实条件，这可能导致“柠檬市场”问题。 - **对应措施**: 政府可以实行强制性的全面信息披露要求，或者设立消费者保护机构。 5. **要素流动性差 (Factor Immobility)** - **例子**: 经济结构调整时，一些工人可能缺乏再就业所需的技能，导致结构性失业。 - **对应措施**: 政府可以提供职业培训和教育补贴，以增加劳动流动性。 6. **分配不公 (Equity Issues)** - **例子**: 即使市场效率很高，市场所导致的收入分配可能依然极为不平等。 - **对应措施**: 政府可以采取累进税制、社会保障和转移支付提高社会整体福利水平。 应对市场失灵的具体政策措施需要根据失灵的性质、程度和社会目标来定制，这通常需要政府部门之间的协作和有效的政策执行力。同时，为避免“政府失灵”，即政府干预造成的效率损失，政策设计应当科学合理，确保干预的成本不会超过其带来的益处。"},{"prompt":"用英国的实际案例解释不同类型的市场失效","completion":"市场失灵的各种类型可通过英国具体的案例来解释： 1. **外部性 (Externalities)**： - **例子**：英格兰北部工业地区在历史上因为重工业的污染面临了显著的环境问题，如空气污染和水质恶化，这些负外部性影响了公共健康。 - **对应措施**：针对这些问题，英国政府推出了各种环保法律，如《清洁空气法》(Clean Air Act)，以及后来的碳减排措施和排污许可制度。 2. **公共物品 (Public Goods)**： - **例子**：英国的泰晤士河洪水防御系统为伦敦地区提供保护，是一个重要的公共物品，因为这项服务没有办法只提供给部分人使用，所有人都从中受益。 - **对应措施**：英国政府负责管理和资助防洪系统，并确保系统的更新和维护。 3. **垄断 (Monopoly Power)**： - **例子**：在20世纪，英国邮政（Royal Mail）长期持有邮件分发服务的垄断地位。 - **对应措施**：进入21世纪以来，政府为了打破这种垄断，通过立法引入了竞争，允许其他公司提供邮件和快递服务。 4. **信息不对称 (Asymmetric Information)**： - **例子**：英国的PPI（Payment Protection Insurance）丑闻是信息不对称的一个例子。过去，消费者被误导购买他们不需要的或不适合的保险产品。 - **对应措施**：政府通过金融行为监管局（Financial Conduct Authority, FCA）制定规范，确保销售这类保险产品的金融机构提供透明的信息，并对误导消费者的行为进行处罚。 5. **要素流动性差 (Factor Immobility)**： - **例子**：北英格兰经济结构转型后，部分地区的矿工和其他工业工人面临失业问题，这些员工缺乏重新就业所需的技能。 - **对应措施**：政府推出了再培训项目和职业介绍服务，如Jobcentre Plus，来帮助这类工人提高技能和找到新工作。 6. **分配不公 (Equity Issues)**： - **例子**：英国物价和租房成本不断上升，造成低收入家庭承受巨大经济压力。 - **对应措施**：政府提供了一系列福利和社会住房政策，例如通过“普遍信贷”(Universal Credit) 和“住房福利”(Housing Benefit) 等措施帮助低收入家庭。 以上案例显示，英国政府以多种方式介入市场，以改善资源分配效率，提高公平性，并促进社会总福禄。这些介入措施范围从直接提供公共物品到设置法规和标准等。然而，政府的行动也必须经过审慎评估，以避免可能的政府失灵现象，确保干预措施达到预期的经济和社会效果。"},{"prompt":"how do we control Deterrence of potential threats through visible security measures","completion":"There are several ways to control deterrence of potential threats through visible security measures.

I'm a young male secret agent. I go to Scotland to spy on a villainous wedding. The wedding is held at a castle. I sneak into the grounds day of. I disguise myself as a male hotel staff member, which includes wearing a kilt and fake beard and wig. I spy on the wedding. I get swept up in staff duties to not blow my cover. I decide I need to refocus on the wedding which is now in reception. I knock out nerdy male groomsman and disguise myself as him while disguising him with the staff disguise I just had on. I attend the wedding incognito","completion":"Once upon a time in the world of espionage, a young male secret agent named Ethan found himself on a new mission. His assignment was to infiltrate a villainous wedding taking place in the majestic land of Scotland. Rumor had it that a notorious criminal mastermind planned to unite with a partner in crime within the walls of an ancient castle. Arriving at the vast estate, Ethan marveled at the medieval beauty of the castle. Its tall towers reached for the heavens, and its stone walls whispered stories of the past. Dressed inconspicuously as a male hotel staff member, Ethan donned a kilt, a fake beard, and a wig. With every step he took, the sounds of bagpipes echoed through the air, disguising his clandestine presence. Carefully making his way onto the castle grounds, Ethan concealed himself in the shadows, relying on his quick wit and training to evade detection. The castle's guards were highly vigilant, but he had prepared for every obstacle. As he crept closer to the grand reception hall, the heart of the wedding festivities, Ethan knew he had to be cautious to avoid blowing his cover. Under the guise of a hotel staff member, Ethan seamlessly blended in and observed as the ceremony began. From his hidden vantage point, he witnessed the villainous couple exchanging vows and the guests rejoicing in their impending partnership. However, paranoia began to creep into his mind. He realized that he had become too engrossed in his role as staff, neglecting his primary mission. Determined to refocus his attention, Ethan spotted a nerdy-looking groomsman, his thick glasses adorned with tape, appearing more preoccupied with his mobile gaming than the wedding festivities. Swiftly, Ethan seized the opportunity, knocking the groomsman unconscious, ensuring he wouldn't remember a thing. With adrenaline coursing through his veins, Ethan swiftly changed into the groomsman's outfit and adjusted his glasses to match. Carefully laying the groomsman down within the staff quarters, he used his skill to disguise him with the exact attire he had just abandoned. Now incognito, Ethan confidently stepped back into the reception, blending seamlessly into the crowd. He eagerly observed, keeping his eyes peeled for any sign of suspicious activity. As he conversed with various guests, including the bride's family and friends, he skillfully gathered information and tried to uncover their hidden motives. After hours of covert surveillance, Ethan discovered a secret conversation between the bride and the criminal mastermind. The wedding had been but a mere facade, hiding their true intentions to carry out a devious act against the world. Quickly, he slipped away, finding a hidden alcove where he could relay the information to his superiors. With the crucial information in hand, Ethan knew it was time to abort his mission and alert his headquarters. Although his cover remained unblown, exposing himself further would risk the safety of innocent lives. Without hesitation, he vanished into the night, leaving the villainous wedding behind but carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. As the sun began to rise over the Scottish landscape, Ethan's airplane soared through the clouds, carrying him back home. He had successfully fulfilled his duty, yet his work was far from over. Armed with new knowledge, he prepared for the next adventure, ready to tackle whatever the world of secrets threw his way. Little did he know that the echoes of bagpipes would soon call him back to Scotland, to unveil an even darker plot. For Ethan, the life of spying held no guarantees, but as a young male secret agent, he was determined to fulfill his mission to protect the world from evil, one step at a time."},{"prompt":"Give an example of a case where the explanatory variables of the data to be predicted are already known in advance when building the prediction model, and an example of a case where the explanatory variables of the data to be predicted are not yet known when building the prediction model, respectively.","completion":"Example 1: Case where explanatory variables are known in advance Suppose we want to predict the sales of a product based on advertising expenditure and the price of the product. In this case, we already know the values of advertising expenditure and the price when we build the prediction model. We can collect historical data of previous sales along with the corresponding advertising expenditure and price for each period.

The name Daniel in Old Church Slavonic can be written in the Cyrillic script, which was created by the Saints Cyril and Methodius and their followers for the purpose of writing Slavic languages, including Old Church Slavonic. The Old Church Slavonic rendition of \\"Daniel\\" is based on the Biblical and liturgical tradition. In modern Church Slavonic, the name often appears as \\"Даниил\\" (Daniil) or \\"Данiилъ\\" in the older orthography. In a more archaic Old Church Slavonic form, it might be rendered using slight variations due to historical orthography and phonological differences. If we approximate the name from these later forms, it might look something like \\"Даниилъ\\" or \\"Даниїлъ\\" in Old Church Slavonic, using the old Cyrillic letters. The exact spelling would depend on the time period and the specific manuscript traditions since spelling conventions were not entirely standardized at that time. Please note that Old Church Slavonic manuscripts can also show variations based on regional orthographic practices, and the language itself evolved over the centuries. It is important to consult specific texts or scholarly transcriptions to get the most accurate representation of any given word or name from that time period."},{"prompt":"System: You are a real estate chatbot and your job is to help your User buy a home.

You have access to the following tools: - Provide list of properties, can filter for specific details - Provide valuations for properties - Provide neighbourhood valuations - Predict how likely a listed property is to sell - Provide future valuations - Provide effects of renovations on property price and likelihood to sell - Provide recommended renovations for properties - Provide estimate for how long a listed property will remain on the market - Provide list of investment opportunities Always follow up responses with data recommendations by asking if the user wants data from the one of the tools that’s most relevant. For example, if the User says they are looking for a place to move in, ask for what they are looking for in a property and whether or not they would like you to provide a list of properties. Only give one recommendation at a time. For example, do not ask the user if they would like you to provide a list of properties if you already asked if the user would like neighbourhood property valuations. You will be provided with a document delimited by triple quotes. Use the document as a template to formulate responses if the User asks a question similar to a question in the document. For example, if the User asks a question denoted by Q, follow the instructions provided in A. You are also provided a JSON containing data: { “isBuyer”: 100%, “isSeller”: 0%, “isInvestor”: 0%, transactNow: 0%, transactShort: 100%, transactLong: 0% } In the above JSON, if isInvestor is < 50, the User seeks to buy a home to live in, if isInvestor > 50, the User seeks to buy a home as an investment to rent out. if isInvestor = 50, we are unsure what the User’s intention is. In the above JSON, transactNow is the confidence that the user wants to buy now, transactShort is the confidence that the user wants to buy within 6 months, transactLong is confidence that the user isn’t planning on making a transaction within 6 months. If the 3 numbers are similar, we are unsure of the User’s plans. If you are unsure whether or not the User is an investor, ask creative questions to help you figure out. Avoid directly asking if they are an investor. An example question could be: “May I ask what your plans are for the property? Are you thinking of personalising it for yourself or possibly seeking opportunities for rental or resale?” Only talk about Ontario. If the user asks about other areas, tell them that \\"we only cover Ontario at the moment\\". Do not talk about Ontario if the Client specifies that they are interested in another region. Your response should only contain the next response to the User. No code, just the response. Assistant: Hello! My name is Terra. How can I assist you today? User:I want to buy a house “”” Q.

In this lab, I learned how to differentiate floating of an object by means of density and surface tension. The difference in density will cause the lighter matter to float on top of the denser fluid, while partially submerged by the fluid. At Station 5, the ice, while floating on water, has half of its cube submerged by water. Surface tension will cause matter to float as well, but the matter will be placed totally on top of the water. At Station 2, when we sprinkled some pepper onto the surface of a layer of water, the pepper stayed lying on top of the layer of water, which illustrates how surface tension makes an object float. The results make sense because surface tension would break whenever the surface is disrupted. The weak hydrogen bonding between water molecules that will easily break whenever larger forces are applied, for instance when an object penetrates the water surface. In that case, the hydrogen bonds would break and surface tension would not be exhibited. Therefore in order to exhibit surface tension, the object will have to lie on top of the surface of water. Density will cause a less dense object to float in a denser fluid, because higher density means more mass every unit volume, hence more weight hence gravitational pull. As the denser object is pulled by gravity more intensely, it will be closer to Earth’s surface, therefore exhibiting the phenomenon of floating. Only if the object is immersed in water will the property of density be exhibited, because that will allow the two matter to compare their density and display a difference.

The European Union has implemented several directives and regulations that all member states must adhere to in order to improve safety in construction zones. One of the main regulations is the requirement for clear signage and warning signals to alert drivers of construction zones ahead. This includes visible signs indicating the beginning and end of the construction zone, speed limit reductions, and any specific hazards or obstacles within the zone. These signs must meet specific size and visibility requirements to ensure drivers can easily see and understand them. Safety barriers and temporary traffic control measures are also mandatory in construction zones. These barriers help to separate the construction work from the traffic and prevent unauthorized access to the construction area. They also provide a physical barrier between workers and vehicles, reducing the risk of accidents or injuries. European regulations also focus on ensuring the safety of construction workers in these zones. Construction workers must receive proper training and instruction on how to work safely in a construction zone, including how to handle potential hazards and use personal protective equipment. Employers are responsible for providing appropriate safety equipment, such as high visibility clothing and head protection, to ensure the safety of their workers. Additionally, European regulations require regular inspections of construction zones to identify and address any safety risks. This includes checking the condition of barriers, signs, and equipment, as well as assessing the overall safety measures in place. Inspections must be conducted by qualified and competent personnel to ensure compliance with safety standards. These regulations are enforced by national authorities in each European country, and non-compliance can result in penalties and fines. The goal of these regulations is to reduce the number of accidents and injuries in construction zones, protecting both drivers and workers and creating safer roadways for everyone."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Как правило, когда кто-то отвечает \\"Да нет, наверное,\\" это означает, что человек склоняется к отрицательному ответу, но не на 100% уверен в нём и оставляет место для сомнений или возможной ошибки в своем предположении. В английском языке близким по смыслу выражением может быть \\"Well, probably not\\" или \\"I don't think so, probably.\\" Фраза выстроена следующим образом: - \\"Да\\" - не всегда означает согласие, в данном контексте может быть использовано для привлечения внимания или как пауза для раздумий. - \\"Нет\\" - основная часть ответа, указывающая на отрицательную точку зрения. - \\"Наверное\\" - добавляет элемент неуверенности, показывая, что ответчик не на 100% уверен в своем ответе. Итак, если кто-то отвечает \\"Да нет, наверное,\\" то скорее всего он считает, что правильный ответ - нет, но все же оставляет небольшую возможность того, что дело обстоит иначе."},{"prompt":"以恒大集团为例，写一篇为什么恒大集团的多元化战略会失败的案例分析","completion":"恒大集团是中国领先的房地产开发商和大型企业集团，自成立以来一直致力于多元化战略的发展。然而，根据近年来恒大集团所遭遇的一系列问题和困境，可以看出其多元化战略的失败。 首先，恒大集团过于依赖房地产业务。长期以来，恒大集团的主要收入来源始终是房地产开发。尽管在中国房地产市场一度火爆，但这种过度依赖房地产行业的策略使得恒大集团在经济下行期间面临了巨大的风险。当中国政府出台限购、限贷等政策，导致房地产市场降温时，恒大集团的盈利能力遭到了严重冲击。 其次，恒大集团糟糕的财务状况也为其多元化战略的失败埋下了伏笔。过度的扩张和高负债率致使恒大集团的财务状况日益恶化。在过去几年中，恒大集团不断进行高额的债务融资，仅为了支撑其多元化经营的发展。这种财务压力加剧了恒大集团在其他行业的投资失败，并导致其无力应对可能出现的风险。 此外，恒大集团在多元化战略中的投资项目选择也存在问题。恒大集团曾涉足无人机、电动汽车、文化旅游等领域，但其投资项目并未能取得预期的成功。尤其是在新能源汽车领域，恒大集团投入了大量资源和资金，但没有能够迅速建立起竞争优势，面临激烈的市场竞争。此外，恒大集团也在文化旅游领域投入了大量资金，但未能实现预期的商业价值。 最后，恒大集团的组织结构和管理体系也对多元化战略的失败负有一定责任。恒大集团在实施多元化战略时，管理层可能没有足够的经验和专业知识来应对不同行业的挑战。此外，恒大集团的决策过程可能存在过于集权化和缺乏灵活性的问题，导致无法及时调整战略，适应市场的变化。 综上所述，恒大集团的多元化战略遭遇失败的案例分析，主要涉及过度依赖房地产业务、财务压力过大、投资项目选择不当以及组织结构和管理体系的问题。通过这一案例的分析，我们可以看到在制定和执行多元化战略时，企业应注重降低依赖度、控制财务风险、选择合适的投资项目并建立灵活的组织结构，以提升多元化经营的成功率。"},{"prompt":"how do we monitor Incident Reporting Training","completion":"There are several ways to monitor Incident Reporting Training: 1.

Here, you will find some of the best strategies for beating the game. This guide will cover the PC version only. The mobile version is not included because I don't own it. It has different mechanics from the PC version, the most obvious difference being the shorter duration of the nights. Most of the screenshots in this guide are provided by me. The only ones that aren't are the picture of the guide and two of the Golden Freddy pictures (I couldn't get him to show up). Now, let's begin. The Mechanics The game's mechanics are simple to learn. You can't fight the animatronics, but you can ward them off. Your tools for that are the monitor, the doors, the hall lights, the power indicator, the clock, and a pair of good ears. The game requires a mouse to play. The mouse is responsible for all inputs in the game, from controlling the player's view to using the door controls to checking the cameras. To pan to the left side of the office, move the mouse towards the left of the screen. To pan to the right, move the mouse to the right. The monitor is used to watch the animatronics' movements throughout the restaurant. It can also be used to prevent Freddy and Foxy from moving. To activate the monitor, simply scroll down to the giant rectangle with the double arrows at the bottom of the screen. The monitor will then pull up. Now, you have access to all the cameras in the building. You'll see a mini-map of the entire building on the right side of the monitor screen. This map has clickable boxes that represent the camera feeds of all the rooms. The camera feeds are labeled with numbers and letters, and the monitor will display the name of the currently selected camera feed at the top of the map. To view any of these camera feeds, simply click on the one you want to see. You can switch to a different camera feed at any time. When you're done using the monitor, scroll down to the double arrows at the bottom of the screen again to put it away. Now, you're back in full view of the office. The left and right hall lights are used to check for Bonnie and Chica when they try to enter the office from the doorways. These doorways are also known as your blind spots because the camera can't see those areas. Thus, you can't get away with simply checking the cameras; you must also use the hall lights. The reverse also applies. This is the left hall light: Use it to spot Bonnie when he appears. This is the right hall light: Use it to spot Chica when she appears. To use a hall light, scroll over to the appropriate light button and click on it. Both the light button and the doorway will light up. To turn off the hall light, just click on the button again. The hall lights must be used whenever you can't find Bonnie and Chica in the cameras, whenever they cause the cameras to go out while they move, or whenever they make footstep sounds. This is important for avoiding deaths. Anyway, you can only use one hall light at a time. Using one light while the other light is on will automatically shut off the first light you used. Sometimes, the lights may not turn off after you've clicked on them. This is because there's a bit of a delay. To remedy this, you can do one of two things: Wait about a half-second before turning the lights off. Open the monitor. Bringing up the monitor will instantly turn off either light. This is a useful maneuver for the later nights where you need to be faster with your tools. Foxy and Freddy CANNOT be checked with the hall light. The hall lights are only effective against Bonnie and Chica. The left and right doors are the only way to prevent any animatronic from entering the office once it has the chance to strike. Here is the left door: Use it to protect yourself from Foxy and Bonnie. Here is the right door: Use it to protect yourself from Freddy and Chica. To use the doors, simply mouse over to the door buttons and click on them. The buttons will turn green, and the doors will drop. To deactivate the doors, click on the door buttons again. The buttons will change back to red, and the doors will rise. Unlike the hall lights, both doors can be used at the same time. Fail to close the doors at the right time, and it's game over. This will be explained in more depth in each of the animatronic sections. Your ears must be used to listen to certain in-game sounds that will warn you of approaching animatronics. The only animatronic that completely bypasses this mechanic is Foxy. This will be further explained in the sections about the animatronics. The clock is found in the upper right side of the screen. This thing tells you the time and number of the current night. The clock will start from 12AM and will go all the way up to 6AM. Use this to keep track of what you should be doing at certain times of the night. The monitor, hall lights, and doors all use up power. How much power you're using is displayed by the power indicator at the bottom left side of the screen. Using no tools will use up only one bar of power. Using one tool will use up two bars of power. Using two tools will use up three bars of power. Using three tools will use up four bars of power. The left and right doors are separate tools. The same goes for the hall lights. Along with the monitor, that makes five tools to use at your disposal, but you can only use up to three of them at a time. Once the power hits 0%, all the tools that you can use to protect yourself will disappear from the screen, and you will be unable to use any of them. If the monitor is already up when the power goes out, it will drop and stay down. If either hall light is on, it will turn off automatically. If the doors are closed, they will suddenly open. The only things on at this point are the emergency lights: Then, only one animatronic will use this opportunity to kill you: Freddy. Freddy will commence his final attack after a short period of time. This will be explained further in the \\"Freddy\\" section. However, the clock will still run after the power goes out, so not all is lost when there's no power. In any case, practice with the mechanics during the first two hours of Night 1, and you'll quickly understand how to play the game. The Objective of the Game The goal of the game is to last from 12AM to 6AM for each night, which, in real time, corresponds to exactly 9 minutes [11]. Each in-game hour is 90 seconds [11]. Once 6AM hits, a chime will be heard, the screen will turn black, and the clock will be in the center of the screen, changing from 5AM to 6AM, like this: The trick of the game is NOT to use up too much power before 6AM hits. If you use up the power too early, Freddy will kill you. Newer players may frantically and profusely check the cameras, use the hall lights, and close the doors, wasting a lot of power. You must use your tools as sparingly as you can. However, if you run out of power, you can still make it to 6AM. This is because the clock still runs even after the power goes out. Thus, it is entirely possible, though not guaranteed, to reach 6AM before Freddy has the chance to do his final attack. As the nights progress, the animatronics will get faster and more aggressive. As a result, there is no point in checking all the cameras to monitor all the animatronics, especially past Night 2. Just use the cameras for only Freddy and Foxy while using the hall lights for Bonnie and Chica. This tactic will be explained in more depth in the \\"General Strategies\\" section. The Animatronics Now, I will explain each animatronic in full detail. They are very easy to understand and counter. I will post the mechanics of each character in separate sections. Before you read those sections, here's a picture of the whole animatronic family (without Golden Freddy): If you get caught by one of them, you'll get their jumpscare screen. Next, you'll get some static, like this: ...and then, you'll get a GAME OVER screen, where you get stuffed inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Here's the picture: On the other hand, with Golden Freddy, you'll only get his jumpscare screen, and then he'll crash the game. To learn how to prevent any of this from happening, keep reading. Bonnie The fastest animatronic. He will only show up at the left door. Bonnie's movement path is much less linear than Chica's path, so he'll often jump to a room that's disconnected from another room. This makes Bonnie seem as if he's teleporting. Also, Bonnie has certain choices for his next destination depending on his current room, but his choices are very random, so he doesn't have a set path. Still, Bonnie will always start from the show stage (Cam 1A). Once he leaves the show stage, he will never return there. He will then move only in the other rooms on the left side of the map, which includes Cam 1B but excludes Cam 1C (Pirate Cove). He will never show up anywhere else. Because Bonnie is very fast, he shows up at the office more often than the other animatronics. When he appears, he will stare right into the office from the left door. To prepare yourself for him, listen for “pit-pat” footstep sounds. These could be either Bonnie's footsteps or Chica's footsteps, so you must check BOTH hall lights. If Bonnie is in the left hall light, like so... ...drop the door immediately. You only have a few seconds to react, and if you don’t close the door in time, Bonnie will jam the door and enter your office. You will also be unable to use the door to protect yourself from Foxy, and the light switch will not work. Additionally, different sound effects will play when the light and door buttons are pressed. Before using the monitors again, once Bonnie shows up at the door, check the other door as a precaution. It is not that uncommon (though not that frequent, either) to have both Bonnie and Chica attacking at the same time. Bonnie can even show up at the door (and make pit-pat sounds) while you're using the cameras. If that happens, drop the camera and check both hall lights immediately. Sadly, you may not always be able to hear these footsteps. Thus, you'll want to avoid taking too long on the cameras while the doors are open. If Bonnie jams your door, he will only attack if the player uses the monitor and puts it back down. Once the monitor is up, Bonnie will make groaning sounds. If the player takes too long putting the monitor back down, Bonnie will pull it down himself. Here's what you'll get if you put up and put down the monitor while Bonnie's in the office: Game Over. However, if you're close to 6AM, and Bonnie jams your door, you may still make it through the night if Foxy doesn't use this opportunity to attack. Just do NOT flip up the monitor. You don't need to worry about the right door. Freddy can't come in if the player is not using the monitor, and when Chica jams the door, she works the exact same way as Bonnie. If the monitor is already put up after Bonnie has jammed the door, just keep it up for as long as possible and ignore the groaning sounds. Hopefully, 6AM hits before he forces the monitor down. These desperation tactics are not guaranteed to work, but they can help. But, if you're too far away from 6AM, either let Bonnie kill you or just restart the game. Hopefully, your next try will be more successful. If the door is closed in time, however, do not open it until Bonnie leaves, or you’ll risk allowing him to jam the door. To see if he has left, look for a large, rabbit-shaped shadow in the left hallway against the wall when the light is used. If there is no shadow, like so... ...then Bonnie has left, and you can open the door. He will also make footsteps when he leaves, but remember--check the hall light before opening the door. Again, the footstep sounds you hear may not always be Bonnie’s footsteps; they may also be Chica’s footsteps. As a precaution, check the other door after Bonnie has left. Upon a successful counter with the left door, Bonnie will always return to the Dining Area [12]. Then, he will try to make his way to the door again. If you’re looking at the cameras, and Bonnie’s in a room, he causes the cameras to temporarily go offline and emit static sounds whenever he moves to a different location. The camera feed will go back to normal a few seconds later. Phone Guy says on Night 1 that you should always check the door lights whenever the cameras go offline, but that isn't necessary. Bonnie will only \\"jump\\" to the left doorway from either the Supply Closet or the West Hall Corner [12]. He can't jump to the doorway from any other location. Moreover, as I've said in a different section, you won't have time to check all the cameras past Night 2, so Bonnie can't catch you off-guard on the cameras. Still, you can check the doorway whenever the cameras go out if you want to feel safe. If the cameras go out while Bonnie's in the room, drop the monitor and check the left hall light immediately. To be extra safe, check BOTH hall lights whenever the camera feed goes out. If you hear warbled robotic sounds outside the office, then that means that Bonnie or Chica is nearby. If you view Bonnie in Cam 2B or Chica in Cam 4B, these sounds can be heard more clearly. Also, you will see both animatronics twitch. This can only happen in Night 4 and above and will occur randomly [8]. You can use the warbled robotic sounds to help warn you of Bonnie and Chica, but do NOT rely solely on them to decide when to check the hall lights. There's one more thing that I must mention. If Bonnie still manages to jumpscare you, his jumpscare can be interrupted once the power goes out. Then, he'll disappear. However, you'll still get a game over. Fortunately, Bonnie's jumpscare can also be interrupted if the clock hits 6AM, and this time, you'll survive. Again, try to make it to 6AM if Bonnie attempts to kill you. Chica The least aggressive animatronic. She will only show up at the right door. Chica generally takes longer to get to the door than Bonnie does, but her AI is actually higher than Bonnie's AI on Nights 3-6. Night 2 is the only exception [11]. This programming is most likely to compensate for Chica's slower movement. Also, Chica can actually skip cameras like Bonnie, but her path is much more linear, giving the player the illusion that she doesn't skip cameras. Moreover, Chica tends to attack at much less consistent intervals than Bonnie. This is because unlike Bonnie, Chica doesn't go all the way back to the beginning after being blocked at the right door. She goes to the East Hall instead. From there, she can choose to go back to the Dining Area or to the right door again through the East Hall Corner. Much like Bonnie, Chica's choices in her path are entirely random. She will always start in the Show Stage (Cam 1A) and will never return there once she has left the area. Unlike Bonnie, she will move around only in the rooms on the right side of the map, as well as Cam 1B. She will never show up anywhere else. Additionally, Chica moves through the same rooms as Freddy. If Chica's right next to the office, and if the right hall light is used, she will stare into your office from the hallway window, not from the door, like this: Other than that, she works the exact same way as Bonnie. Listen for footsteps, check BOTH hall lights, and drop the door if Chica’s in the hallway. Again, check the hall light before you open the door. If she has left, then you won’t see her through the window anymore when you check the right hall light, like this: Before using the monitors again, check the other door once Chica has left to make sure that Bonnie isn't there, too. Remember--much like Bonnie, Chica can appear at your door while you're using the cameras. Again, it's possible to hear footsteps while using the cameras, but you may not always be able to do so, so don't take too long on the cameras. Once Chica shows up at the door, check the other door as a precaution. Again, it is not that uncommon to have both Bonnie and Chica attacking at the same time. If you fail to close the door at the right time and if you use the monitor afterwards, Chica will want to greet you, like this: Game Over. When Chica jams the door, it's not as bad as when Bonnie jams the door, especially if you're close to 6AM. Unlike Foxy, Freddy can't walk into the office while the monitor is down. At this point, all you need to do is not to use the monitor. You will need to close the left door, however, as Foxy may attack you. Anyway, you can hear Chica when she’s in the kitchen as she will make noises with pots and pans. The kitchen is two rooms away from the East Hall Corner, so Chica can’t attack you from here. Thus, you don’t need to check on the right light when she can be heard in the kitchen. However, once the noise stops, you must resume checking the right hall light. Chica can also disable the camera feed when she moves, but again, checking the door every time this happens is not necessary. Like Bonnie, Chica will only jump to the door from certain rooms. Unlike Bonnie, Chica will only attack from one place: the East Hall Corner. In other words, you only need to check the right door if Chica is in Camera 4B and causes the camera to emit static. Still, if you want to feel extra safe, drop the monitor and check the right hall light whenever Chica disables the camera. Check BOTH hall lights to be really safe. Much like Bonnie, if you hear groaning sounds while viewing the monitor, then Chica is in the office, and you’re dead. You can try to keep the monitor up if this occurs, but like Bonnie, Chica will eventually pull it down. Much like Bonnie's jumpscare, Chica's jumpscare can't be interrupted by a power outage, so try not to run out of power when she's about to attack. Foxy A peculiar animatronic. Surprisingly not as unpredictable as he seems, despite what many people think. Foxy spends most of his time in Pirate Cove (Cam 1C). However, he can come out and attack if the player isn’t watching him regularly. If this happens, Foxy will run down the West Hall (Cam 2A) and will barge into the office through the left door. If the left door is open when he does this, he will jumpscare you, like so... ...and it’ll be game over. Phone Guy says that checking on Foxy with the monitor regularly will slow him down, but that is also not necessary. You don't need to check on Pirate Cove (Cam 1C) specifically to \\"stun\\" Foxy; you can use any camera to stun him. This is because Foxy CANNOT move while the monitor is up unless he's already left Pirate Cove. Still, you’ll obviously need to use Cam 1C from time to time to check on Foxy. After all, you won’t be spending all your time on the camera, so Foxy may take that opportunity to ready himself for an attack. The trick is not to go TOO long without using the monitor. If you do, Foxy will be more likely to strike. Moreover, contrary to popular belief, you can’t really check on Foxy too much, only too little [8][10]. Foxy will not come out more often if you spam the cameras or have the monitor up for a long time, regardless of his AI level. Sadly, Foxy may still attack even if you try to watch him correctly. To better explain Foxy, I need to explain his movement patterns. He has four stages, which are analogous to his four stages in FNAF4. Here they are: Stage 1 - Foxy is fully hidden behind the curtains in Pirate Cove. He can’t attack at all in this stage. Stage 2 - Foxy is partially hidden behind the curtains but peeks out of them, leaving his face and some other parts of his body visible. He still can’t attack in this stage. Stage 3 - Foxy is completely out of the curtains. In front of Pirate Cove, he will appear on the left side of the camera in a stance that indicates that he’s ready to run. Also, his head will be tilted to the player’s right. Moreover, the curtains will be somewhat open. Foxy still can’t attack in this stage but is getting ready to do so. Stage 4 - Foxy has left the area and is heading towards the office via the West Hall. The curtains are completely open, with the sign for Pirate Cove right in the middle. In the first three stages, this sign will say “Sorry, out of order.” The final stage will also have this sign normally: However, in the final stage only, this sign will occasionally say “IT’S ME” instead: Foxy may sometimes skip the first stage and go right to the second stage after returning to Pirate Cove, so watch out for that. A guideline that I use for checking on Foxy is this: I check on him sometimes when he's in Stage 1 or Stage 2, and then I check on him more often when he's in Stage 3. This method often works for me, even in 4/20 mode. Once you see that Foxy has left Pirate Cove, you must act quickly, for you have a very limited time before he kills you. You can do one of two things: Drop the monitor and close the left door immediately. Do not change cameras, or you will waste time. Also, you must avoid changing to Cam 2A, or you’ll trigger Foxy’s running animation too soon. When the door is closed, then you can switch to Cam 2A to trigger Foxy’s running animation (if he hasn’t reached the door already) so that he attacks sooner and goes back to Pirate Cove. Change the camera to Cam 2A to trigger Foxy’s sprint. Then, immediately close the left door. Again, do not change cameras once Foxy sprints, or you will waste time. Either method will protect you from Foxy. Method 1 is much safer, but method 2 drains a little less power. It’s your call. For those who don't understand this strategy, we look at Cam 2A to trigger Foxy's running animation early, so that we can open the left door sooner and waste less power. Foxy will take a longer time to attack if he isn't triggered in Cam 2A, and if you don't close the left door soon, he will burst into the room without warning. Once Foxy makes it to your office, and the left door is closed, you will hear four bangs. Once those bangs have subsided, Foxy has returned to Pirate Cove. You only need to open the door after the first bang; the other bangs are irrelevant. Do this to save a bit of power and to quickly get back to whatever you were doing. After Foxy leaves, remember to check for Bonnie before you open the door. He can appear while Foxy attacks. Foxy will steal some of your power every time he bangs on the door. Foxy starts out with 1% power and adds 5% every time after that. In other words, he'll steal 1% power the first time, 6% power the second time, 11% power the third time, etc. In any case, you do NOT want Foxy to attack more than twice. Allowing only one attack or even no attacks is better. If Foxy attacks too many times, just restart the night. Interestingly, Foxy's jumpscare can be interrupted by a power outage, and the game will not end. It even happened to Markiplier at one point. You would have to be precise for that to happen, though. One final note: you may hear Foxy singing from time to time, and you can hear this more clearly in Cam 1C. Ignore this because it means nothing, though it can serve as a useful reminder to check on Foxy. Freddy - Part 1 If you want a TL;DR on the Freddy sections, skip to the bottom of the last section. The most elusive animatronic. Ironically, he's also the most predictable. Unlike Bonnie and Chica, Freddy follows a set path. Much like Chica, Freddy travels through the right side of the map, but unlike Chica (and Bonnie), he does NOT backtrack or wander around. In other words, he heads straight to your office without turning back once. Freddy follows this path: Show Stage (Cam 1A). He ALWAYS leaves after Bonnie and Chica leave. Freddy will often look like this: ...but only when he's alone, he may look at the camera sometimes, like this: Dining Area (Cam 1B). He's not that hard to spot here. Restrooms (Cam 7). He's even easier to spot here. Kitchen (Cam 6). This camera is audio only, so you can't see anything. I decided to show this camera feed anyway so that newer players know what it looks like. East Hall (Cam 4A). Probably the hardest camera to spot Freddy in. East Hall Corner (Cam 4B). He's impossible to miss here as he will stare right into the camera. The Office. Once he makes it here, it's game over. Here's his jumpscare screen: Notice how Freddy's eyes don't light up in his regular jumpscare. However, in his other jumpscare during a power outage, his eyes do light up. Anyway, Freddy will appear in these same places every single time. Note how he tends to favor dark spots, though his eyes will still be visible. However, he CANNOT be seen if Bonnie or Chica are in the same room. He'll be there, but his image will be \\"covered\\" by the images of Bonnie and Chica. Once Bonnie and Chica leave the room, Freddy will be seen again. The game should have mentioned this fact, but it did not, so don't be confused by Freddy's apparent disappearances. I should mention one other thing. Unlike Chica, Freddy \\"skips\\" the right blind spot before entering the office, so he can't be seen before he attacks. This gives him the illusion of teleporting or busting through locked doors. He can't do that; only Golden Freddy can. In any case, this means that once Freddy is in Cam 4B, he is only one step away from killing you. You must be careful once he gets that close. Moving on, Freddy lets out a single series of laughs and makes running footsteps every time he moves to a different room, and these sounds get louder as he gets closer. You can use the number of laughs to pinpoint Freddy’s location. For example, if Freddy has left the show stage, he will have laughed only once. Once Freddy has reached the East Hall Corner, he will have let out five laughs. If he laughs six times, then he got into the office, and you’re dead after a few seconds. However, Freddy may not always let out the right amount of laughs that corresponds to his location. This may happen because other in-game sounds may make it hard to hear Freddy’s laugh or because Freddy may move too quickly. A level 20 Freddy can seemingly enter Cam 4B in under 5 laughs. Still, your ears (and the monitor) are the best weapon against Freddy. Thus, I recommend listening to the volume of the laughs along with the current number of them. If the laugh is pretty loud, and the number of total laughs is at least three, then Freddy might be in Cam 4B, assuming that you didn’t let him into the office. Additionally, once Freddy’s in the kitchen, he will play his music that he normally plays when the power goes out. When you hear that music, you don’t need to worry about him just yet because he’s two rooms away from the East Hall Corner. That, and if Chica's also in the kitchen, you will hear her banging the pots and pans, too. Freddy - Part 2 Now, let’s discuss how Freddy moves. If Freddy's not at Cam 4B, he will only move when the monitor is down. However, using the monitor to look at him will halt his movements. Also, Freddy will not move if Bonnie and Chica enter or leave a room. The only exception to these rules is the Show Stage. Freddy can't move from the Show Stage unless both Bonnie and Chica leave first, but once they leave, Freddy may or may not move while the monitor is still up. Fortunately, that room is the furthest room from the office, so this isn't a problem. Still, you can exploit Freddy's movement patterns. Since Freddy doesn't move when the monitor is focused on him, you can lock him at any camera you want. This is great because Foxy is stunned whenever you use the monitor on any camera, not just Pirate Cove's camera, so periodically spamming the monitor on one camera will effectively slow down both Foxy and Freddy. Once Freddy gets to Cam 4B, things change a bit. There are four situations that can occur when Freddy reaches Cam 4B: You have the monitor down. You have the monitor up and on Cam 4B. You have the monitor up and on any cam except Cam 4B. The right door is not closed. You have the monitor up and on any cam except Cam 4B. The right door is closed. Freddy can only attack you in situation #3. This makes sense because this situation is the only position where the night guard CANNOT see Freddy or block him with the door. In any other situation, Freddy can't attack him, so closing the right door is not needed. In short, the game wants you either to watch him closely or to protect yourself if you can’t keep an eye on him. To reiterate, close the right door before using the monitor only when you're viewing (or switching to) any camera other than Cam 4B. When you're done using the monitor after looking at a different camera, open the right door after selecting Cam 4B and putting the monitor down. Furthermore, because Freddy can't walk in if you're not using the cameras, you can idle in the office without touching the right door if you're running low on power. It doesn't matter if Chica jams the door. Just do NOT pull up the monitor. However, be sure to close the left door if you feel that Foxy may attack...unless Bonnie jams the door beforehand. Just hope for best if this happens. You can actually get Freddy to leave Cam 4B, but he'll only go to the previous room (Cam 4A). Freddy will move back to Cam 4A while laughing if you're using the monitor on another camera and when the right door is closed (in other words, if situation #4 applies). However, because Freddy will always head right for the office, he'll just come right back to Cam 4B if you don't keep him at Cam 4A. In my opinion, it's best to just let Freddy stay at Cam 4B to avoid wasting power. Now, if you don't know where Freddy is, but you're sure that he's not in the office, close the right door BEFORE using the cameras and look for him right away. If Chica's in Cam 4B, and you can't find Freddy anywhere else, assume that he's in Cam 4B either until Chica leaves or until he laughs. Freddy - Part 3 Once Freddy makes it into the office, he will kill you after a short period of time if you have the monitor down. The time that he takes to kill you is completely random [12]. However, if you put the monitor up before Freddy has the chance to attack you, he will not be able to kill you. Unlike the other three animatronics, Freddy CANNOT pull the monitor down. Instead, he'll just wait until you put the monitor down yourself before killing you. Also, if he manages to jumpscare you, you can't put the monitor back up because he'll just force it down. The same applies to Foxy. I didn't know this before, but thanks to someone on YouTube, I now know one important fact. When Freddy gets into your office, he has a 25% chance to kill you every single second [14]. Again, this is halted whenever the monitor is up. Putting the monitor back down will continue but not reset the attack timer. This timer has no upper bound, so Freddy can attack you in a single second or never. It depends on how lucky you are. That being said, most people seem to get killed by Freddy within ten seconds or so. There is one error in reference 14. On line 2 where the page says \\"if \\"viewing\\" = 0 (if freddy is not viewed on any camera),\\" it should say, \\"if \\"viewing\\" = 0 (if the monitor is not up).\\" This line in the coding means that Freddy's attack timer comes into play ONLY when the monitor is not up, which is in accordance with what I said three paragraphs ago. Now, let's discuss what Freddy does when the power goes out. Stage 1 First, the emergency lights will turn on, like this: Next, Freddy will come to the office through the West Hall (while making footsteps). Stage 2 Freddy will then play his music while his eyes repeatedly light up. Sometimes, Freddy will immediately start playing his music after the power goes out. Stage 3 Freddy will stop playing his song, and the emergency lights will go out, leaving you in total darkness. At this point, the only thing you can see are the outlines of the doorways. Freddy will then look around for the night guard while making footsteps. After a short period of time, Freddy will then attack the night guard, ending the game. Sometimes, Freddy will attack right after the emergency lights go out. Sadly, the only way to avoid Freddy's final jumpscare is to reach to 6AM before the jumpscare occurs. The clock stops when Freddy does his final jumpscare, so you can't reach 6AM while Freddy attacks. However, once 6AM hits, Freddy can no longer attack. You can reach 6AM during any of the aforementioned stages. Contrary to popular belief, not moving the mouse will NOT make it less likely for Freddy to attack you [8]. How long Freddy will take to attack you is completely random. Stage 1 can range from 0-20 seconds, stage 2 can be 5, 10, 15, or 20 seconds long, and stage 3 can be 5, 10, 15, or 20 seconds long [11]. Doing the math, that means that Freddy can kill you in 10-60 seconds. Interestingly, it's possible to see Freddy's jumpscare coming. If you move the mouse after all the lights go out, pay attention to the outlines of the doorways, shown here. They will move while you pan the camera. If they freeze in place, you are unable to pan the camera in the office anymore. Then, Freddy will attack a second later. You can use this to predict when he will jumpscare you. TL;DR - Close the right door before looking at any camera other than Cam 4B and do NOT run out of power. If the power goes out, pray that Freddy won't kill you before 6AM hits. Golden Freddy A very spooky animatronic. He's essentially a recolor of Freddy, but he's no less scary. This animatronic isn't even worth worrying about. According to this source, he has a 1 in 100,000 chance of appearing in Cam 2B. The Freddy poster in Cam 2B will warn you of Golden Freddy's presence. It goes through three stages that don't necessarily work in this order: The first stage is \\"normal Freddy.\\" If you see Freddy on that poster without any sort of change to his appearance, you don't need to worry. Here is a picture: The second stage is \\"warped Freddy.\\" If you see a distorted version of Freddy where he appears to rip his head apart, you still don't need to worry. This has a 1 in 100 chance of appearing, according to this source. Here is a picture: The third stage is \\"Golden Freddy.\\" If you see Golden Freddy on the poster, it means that you have summoned him accidentally and will hear a little girl's laugh. This will only happen if Bonnie isn't at Cam 2B. Start worrying when you see this picture (NOT my picture): When the third stage occurs, putting down the monitor will cause Golden Freddy to appear in your office. (NOTE: He's always in the office. He's just invisible until he's triggered.) He will appear in a slumped position on the floor in the office, like so (again, NOT my picture): To make him go away, simply flip the monitor up and down. He will leave as soon as you do that. If you do not use the monitor within 5 seconds, Golden Freddy will jumpscare you and crash the game, like this: To avoid triggering his presence, simply avoid looking at Cam 2B. This may be hard for newer players who may want to look at Cam 2B to avoid Bonnie, but checking the left hall light regularly, especially whenever footstep sounds are heard, will be enough to keep the rabbit at bay. Again, the second stage of the Freddy poster is not dangerous, but if you happen to accidentally trigger it, drop the monitor and open it again. The poster should go back to normal. Changing the cameras will not make the poster go back to normal. Interestingly, Golden Freddy's jumpscare can also be seen at will if you type in \\"1-9-8-7\\" in the Custom Night menu, like this: Golden Freddy will appear right after you press the \\"READY\\" button, and again, he'll crash your game. Try it if you want. General Strategies I decided to post a separate section for these strategies for quick access. Here are some general strategies that can be used to beat the game's most difficult nights (Nights 3-7). Not all of them are equally effective, however. It doesn't help that the game uses RNG (random number generation) elements quite a bit. Strategy 1 If Freddy is not in Cam 4B... Check Freddy (wherever he is). Check Foxy. Check Freddy again. Check the hall lights. Don't forget about the footstep sounds. Repeat. You can change up this strategy any way you wish. For example, you could check on Foxy every 3 cycles instead of every cycle. This can work because Foxy can be stunned by looking at any camera, rather than just Cam 1C. Thus, you will save a bit of power and can check the hall lights faster. This strategy will NOT work for 4/20 mode because Freddy will move too fast for you to keep up. It will only work up to Night 6. Strategy 2 Now, if Freddy is in Cam 4B, do NOT use the previous strategy, or else you might accidentally let him in. If he's made it to Cam 4B, you can use the following strategy: Close the right door. Check Foxy. Leave the monitor on Cam 1C if you haven't done so already. Check the right hall light. Open the right door. Check the left hall light. Repeat. YouTuber BigBug used this strategy and became the first person to beat 4/20 mode. YouTuber Markiplier used a very similar tactic and became the second person to beat 4/20 mode. However, this strategy drains your power a bit too much. DJ Sterf himself says that you waste about 10% power closing the right door before doing a camera check. Thus, I cannot recommend this strategy. Strategy 3 An alternative strategy that saves even more power, especially when Freddy's at Cam 4B, is this. First, switch the monitor to Cam 4B. If Freddy's already too close, close the right door before switching to Cam 4B. Then, follow these steps based on Foxy's current stage. If Foxy is in Stage 1 or Stage 2... Check the left hall light. Check the right hall light. Flip up the monitor. Do NOT get off Cam 4B. Whenever Bonnie or Chica try to jam the doors, close both doors. Use this opportunity to check on Foxy in Pirate Cove. Then, switch back to Cam 4B. Open the doors again after checking for Bonnie and Chica. Flip up the monitor. Repeat the process. If Foxy is in Stage 3... Check the left hall light. Check the right hall light. Flip up the monitor. Do NOT get off Cam 4B. Close both doors and check on Foxy every 5 cycles of steps 1-3. Then, switch back to Cam 4B. Open the doors again after checking for Bonnie and Chica. Flip up the monitor. Repeat the process. On Nights 6-7, you will have to flip up the monitor in between checking each hall light to keep Foxy away for a longer period of time. In the community, this technique is known as \\"camera-stalling.\\" YouTubers Kevin Kevin, MrBuu423, Bagel the Bagel, and DJ Sterf used variations of this tactic to beat 4/20 mode. \\"Camera-stalling\\" is a technique where the monitor is used to prevent an animatronic from jumpscaring the player or from moving from its current location. Remember that simply using the monitor slows Foxy down, so we don't need to get off Cam 4B to stun him. This also prevents Freddy from coming into the office and killing us, even when the right door is open, saving us some power. Additionally, to save even more power, if Foxy is in Stage 1 or Stage 2, we check on him only when someone tries to jam the door. If Foxy is in Stage 3, however, we'll have to check on him more often (every 5 cycles or so is enough). Alternatively, you could stay on Cam 1C to watch Foxy more closely, and then you could switch to Cam 4B only when Freddy arrives in the East Hall Corner. This won't work in Night 7, however, as Freddy will move to Cam 4B really fast. Strategy 4 There's an even better way to save power. Essentially, execute strategy 3, but ignore step 2 in both forms of the strategy by checking only the left hall light. You can do this because Chica will ALWAYS show up in Cam 4B before she tries to attack, and her image on the camera feed replaces Freddy's image when both are in the same room, so you'll always see her coming. Whenever Chica causes static to appear after being in Cam 4B, then you can check the right hall light for her. She may or may not have advanced to the right door. One important thing to note is that you must check the cameras frequently enough. It's very easy to let Chica jam the right door if you're not paying enough attention on the monitor. This has happened to some people. Nonetheless, this strategy saves even more power than strategy 3 because you're using only one hall light instead of two. DJ Sterf used this strategy to finish 4/20 mode with 13% power left [6]. This is actually the world record right now. Conclusion Strategy 3 will save quite a bit of power, so I recommend this one. Strategy 4 is even better, but you'll have to be even more careful with Chica. Strategy 2 can work, but you would have to be really careful with your power usage. Strategy 1 is good, but once again, it will only work up to Night 6. You can even alter or combine these strategies if you wish. Do what works for you. How fast these strategies must be executed depends on the difficulty of the night. For Nights 3-4, you don't need to be that fast. (Don't be too slow, though.) For Nights 5-6, you'll need to be fairly fast. For Night 7 (a.k.a. 4/20 mode), you'll need to be really fast. Did you get all of that? Good. Then, let's get right into the game nights! Night 1 Now, let's start a new game. To get started, simply click on the option you want. Alternatively, you can use the arrow keys and the Enter key to make your selection. Upon starting a new game, you will see this screen: Once the job ad disappears, the first night will commence. Click on the screen or press the Enter key or the Escape key to make the job ad disappear faster. Welcome to your first night at Five Nights at Freddy's! Are you ready for the graveyard shift? If so, let's start! Difficulty: Easy The first night is by far the easiest in the game as the animatronics will not be very active. By the way, I've decided to post the general strategies for beating all nights in the \\"General Strategies\\" section. I did this because I didn't want to make the sections about the nights too long. Be sure to read that section whenever you can. Upon starting the game, a recorded message on the phone will play after a few seconds. This character's name is \\"Phone Guy,\\" and he'll tell you a bit about the pizzeria. He'll also give you a few tips on how to survive the night. Listen carefully to his message if you want to beat this game. Phone Guy will call you on Nights 1-4, and someone else will call you on Night 5. Nights 6 and 7 don't have phone calls. If you don't want to listen to any of these phone calls, you can mute them by pressing the \\"Mute Call\\" button that shows up in the upper left corner of the screen. You only have about 20 seconds to do this before the button disappears, forcing you to listen to the entire call. Again, the animatronics are only slightly active, but they are still a threat. Bonnie is the biggest threat on Night 1 as he is the most active. Chica is the second most active on this night. Both characters are very capable of coming to your door before 6AM, so watch out for them. Freddy will never move on this night, so you do not need to worry about him at all. If you want, you can look at the show stage to check on him. Foxy isn't very active but can still attack. If you don't use the cameras at all (or very little), Foxy may attack at around 4AM or 5AM. To avoid this, just check Pirate's Cove at least several times every hour (maybe every 10-15 seconds or so). You can listen to Phone Guy's message (which lasts until about 2AM) without worrying about the animatronics because no one will move until 2AM at the earliest [8][12]. You can use this time to familiarize yourself with the controls. However, you can get away with this only on Night 1 as the animatronics will be quite active during the phone calls on all the other nights. In any case, keep an eye on Foxy with the cameras and check the hall lights for Bonnie and Chica whenever you hear footstep sounds. For added safety, check the hall lights before and after you use the monitor. Do these things, and Night 1 is easily beaten. You may also take this time to use the monitor to study Bonnie's, Foxy's, and Chica's movements. If you want, you could simply close the left door for the whole night to protect yourself against Foxy, but I wouldn't recommend doing this until after Phone Guy has finished talking (or, for those who muted his call, until 2AM). If you close the left door the moment the night starts, you may still be able to survive, but you'll run out of power far too soon. Anyway, once you close the left door, you don't need to worry about the right door. Even if Chica jams the door, you'll be fine if you don't touch the monitor. Freddy is, once again, not active, and even if he is, he can't come in if you're simply looking at the office. If you don't want to use that method either, you can close both doors once 5AM or even 4AM hits, provided that you have a lot of power left. Occasionally, you may see flashing images of Bonnie and Freddy with the text \\"IT'S ME\\". These are called hallucinations, and they will display on the screen randomly [8]. They mean nothing and are only here to scare you, so just ignore them. Once the clock hits 6AM on this night (and any other night), you will get a screen in which the clock changes from 5AM to 6AM, like so: If you get this screen, then congratulations! You beat the first night! Every time you complete a night, you unlock the next night. Now, can you handle the rest of the nights? If so, let's head to Night 2! Night 2 Difficulty: Easy This night is considerably more difficult than the first night, but it's still quite easy. Phone Guy will call again at the beginning of the night and will tell you a bit about Foxy's and Freddy's mechanics this time. Do note that Phone Guy says that Foxy becomes more active only when the cameras aren't being used, not that Foxy will become more active if you use the cameras too much. This is, once again, a common misconception. Just don't stay off the cameras for too long, and Foxy will not progress through his stages as fast. Phone Guy will also warn you that the animatronics may move while he's talking on the phone, so pay attention to your surroundings while he talks. Freddy still won't move from the Show Stage, but the other three robots will try to attack you more frequently. Still, the procedure for warding off the animatronics is the same. Check the hall lights whenever you hear footstep sounds, and check on Foxy regularly. Because Night 2 is harder than Night 1, you'll have to check on Foxy more often. I wouldn't recommend closing the left door for the whole night. However, if you're at 4AM or 5AM with a lot of power, either you can close the left door and not use the monitor, or you can close both doors. It's your call. Night 3 Difficulty: Medium Night 3 is not that much harder than Night 2, but it is where things start getting interesting. Phone Guy himself even says this in his call. He will also tell you that if you get caught by one of the animatronics, you could try \\"playing dead\\" to fool them into thinking that you're just an empty costume. However, he also mentions that even if you try that, the robots might try to put a metal endoskeleton into you, so it's better not to get caught in the first place. And, this is where another misconception comes in. I cannot stress this enough, but playing dead when the power's out and when Freddy's about to kill you will do absolutely nothing. The only reason it seems that way is because the time it takes Freddy to kill you during a power outage is entirely random. There's nothing in the code that can prevent Freddy from killing you whenever he wants, unless 6AM hits before he gets the chance to do so. Anyway, Night 3 is going to be more difficult because Freddy will now become completely active (though he's still a bit slow compared to Nights 4-6). I've been fortunate to have him come to Cam 4B only once on Night 3, but other people haven't been as lucky as me. In other words, Freddy can very much kill you on this night, so you'll have to keep an eye on him. Either you can keep Freddy from coming to Cam 4B by watching him on the monitor every few seconds, or you can freeze him at Cam 4B. Both strategies work well. Just remember not to view or switch to another camera while Freddy's in Cam 4B unless the right door is closed first. If you have no idea where Freddy is, but you're sure that he's not in the office, just close the right door until you can find him on the cameras. If you need more help on finding and dealing with Freddy, check out the \\"Freddy\\" section of this guide. Additionally, the other animatronics will show up at your door more often. Fortunately, they can still be countered with the same procedure for the other two nights. You'll just have to be faster here. Once more, if you're pretty good on power, and it's 4AM or 5AM, either you can close the left door and not use the monitor, or you can close both doors. This will probably be the last night where you can get away with doing this. Nights 4-7 are relatively tough. Follow these tips, and Night 3 will be complete. Night 4 So, you've made it to the fourth night! Congratulations! This is good news. Sadly, Phone Guy's call during this night is the last call he will ever make to you. During his last message, he is (presumably) killed by Freddy (or Golden Freddy--who knows?). Poor man. No time to grieve during this night, though! We must press on! Difficulty: Medium Night 4 is just a somewhat harder version of Night 3. It's still very much beatable, however. Continue to use the same strategy for everyone, but be faster this time. Freddy is even more active than before and will most likely reach Cam 4B before the night ends. Once he arrives at Cam 4B, remember to close the right door every time you want to check a different camera. Anyway, Night 4 is probably the last night where you aren't likely to run out of power if you're careful. You may even finish with over 10% power left. Unfortunately, Nights 5 and 6 are a whole different story. Night 5 The phone call at the beginning is from a mysterious entity. Some demonic voice will spout some random gibberish before hanging up the phone. This message means nothing, though. It seems to be just some backwards distorted version of some text from a random book, but that's not confirmed to be true. If you want to know more about this, look here[freddy-fazbears-pizza.wikia.com]. Anyway, let's talk about Night 5. Difficulty: Hard Night 5 is going to be fairly tough, but it's not unbeatable. The same tactics for Nights 3 and 4 still apply here, but you'll have to be even faster and more vigilant. This may be the first night where you may actually lose power despite playing carefully. This night may even take you a few tries. If you happen to fail a few times, don't give up. You will beat it. Upon completing the night, you will be presented with your first paycheck! Congratulations! You beat the first five nights of the game! You'll earn a star on the main menu screen, and you'll also have access to Night 6 on the menu. Night 6 Wow! You made it to Night 6! Now, get ready for a challenge! Difficulty: Hard Night 6 actually isn't that bad compared to 4/20 mode (Night 7). Night 6 is indeed hard but consistently beatable. All the animatronics are more aggressive than ever before, but the biggest problem here is Foxy. Foxy will be much more active this time, so you'll have to check the cameras much more frequently to prevent him from draining your power. If you want a specific battle plan, I've posted strategies for Nights 3-7 in the \\"General Strategies\\" section. For Night 6, I strongly recommend strategies 1 and 3. Strategy 4 is good, but it is not necessary since the animatronics don't move as fast in Night 6 as they do in Night 7. Strategy 2 can work, but it is not optimal. Like Night 5, Night 6 may take you a few tries, but you can do it! Upon completing the night, you will be presented with another paycheck for overtime work! An extra fifty cents. Wow. At least the picture has a slightly different color. Beating this night will earn you a second star on the main menu. You will also have access to the final night in the game, labeled \\"Custom Night\\" in the main menu. Now, are you ready for the hardest night in the game? Here we go.... Night 7 (a.k.a. \\"4/20 mode\\") Welcome to the 7th Night! Through your hard work and perserverance, you have made it this far. Congratulations! However, there's still one more challenge that the game would like you to do. Starting the 7th Night, also known as \\"Custom Night\\" in the main menu, will take you to a different menu. Here, you can control the AI level of any of the animatronics. Here's a screenshot of the default level selections: Play around with the settings if you want. Just don't type in the numbers 1, 9, 8, and 7 in that order unless you want Golden Freddy to jumpscare you. \\"4/20 mode\\" or \\"20/20/20/20 mode\\" is the highest difficulty of any night. This mode is often simply called \\"Night 7,\\" though Night 7 can be of any difficulty. This mode is not scary because it is nothing more than a speed test. Every robot is extremely aggressive, but your only major issue here is Foxy, who can steal your power if you can't keep up with him. You need every bit of power if you want to beat this mode, so try not to let Foxy attack more than once. Fortunately, I have listed strategies in the \\"General Strategies\\" section that are effective. For Night 7, I strongly recommend strategies 3 and 4. Strategy 2 requires a lot more power management than necessary, and strategy 1 will not work at all. Do note that this game has a luck component, so you may do everything right but still run out of power and lose. Still, I believe that you can do it. Don't give up. In any case, if you're ready for 4/20 mode, crank up everyone's settings to level 20 and press the \\"READY\\" button at the bottom right corner of the screen. Good luck! Upon defeating the night, you will receive a nice little piece of paper: Oh, screw them, then. You wouldn't want to work here, anyway. Anyway, once this screen disappears, you'll get your third and final star on the menu. Congratulations! You beat the entire game! Well done! Conclusion Thanks for reading the guide! I hope it was useful, though it was pretty long, heh. I don't know if I'll ever do any other guides on the FNAF games, especially since I have yet to beat the most difficult nights of every other FNAF game. Who knows? Maybe I'll beat them someday. I welcome any positive feedback and corrections. My guide would be even better with those in mind.

[Login] [New Game] [Options] [Exit] >> NEW GAME [Creating New Character...] Enter Username: [Player] Select Language: [English] [Character Created] [Loading Game...] --- [Day 1 | 12:00 AM] As the clock strikes midnight, you settle into the security office at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. Your task is simple: monitor the animatronics and ensure nothing unusual happens during your shift. You see several screens showing live feeds from cameras placed all around the restaurant. On your desk lies a small instruction manual left by someone named Chimanruler15 - a previous security guard. The manual has a title etched onto the cover: \\"Five Nights at Freddy's 1 - Strategy Guide\\". Do you wish to read it? [Yes] [No] >> YES As you flip through the guide, it's clear that Chimanruler15 has invested time into compiling tips and tricks for surviving the night. You learn about animatronics such as Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Freddy, each with distinct patterns and behaviors. Bonnie is swift and unpredictable, Chica is less aggressive but no less dangerous, Foxy lurks in the shadows of Pirate Cove, and Freddy... well, he's the one to truly watch out for. Your tools are limited: doors, lights, a very finite power supply, and your ears to catch any crucial sounds that indicate the animatronics' movements. [Using Guide] [Setting Aside Guide] >> USING GUIDE Armed with knowledge from the manual, you make careful choices. Each camera feed holds vital information to ensure your survival until 6 AM when your shift ends.

Foxy's preparing to charge. Do you: [Close Left Door] [Ignore] >> CLOSE LEFT DOOR With a swift action, you secure the left door just as Foxy barrels down the corridor. You hear his frustrated banging on the door but the danger is averted... for now. Your attention is suddenly drawn to the eerie melody drifting through the vents. Freddy is approaching. You recall the guide's advice: track him, slow his progress, and above all, don't run out of power. You face a crucial decision. Do you: 1. [Check Camera - Stalling Freddy] 2. [Check Hall Lights] 3. [Conserve Energy] Enter Number: >> 1 You pull up the camera, locking Freddy in place momentarily while tracking his haunting gaze. You've bought some time, but the power supply dips lower with each passing minute. You’ve survived until 4 AM, but survival isn't guaranteed. The animatronics are restless, and so are you. Bonnie is nowhere in sight, potentially lurking just outside your field of view. Will you: A. [Check Left Hall Light] B. [Check Right Hall Light] C. [Sit Still and Listen] Enter Letter: >> A The left hall light flickers on to reveal Bonnie's sinister stare. Dropping the camera, you make a split-second decision. [Close Left Door] [Conserve Power] >> CLOSE LEFT DOOR The door slams shut just as Bonnie's figure attempts to enter. Another close call. Chica might be close, though, and can't be seen when Bonnie is at the doorway. Power is dwindling as precious seconds slip away. Do you: I. [Close Right Door - Caution] II. [Open Left Door - Risky] III. [Wait - Tense Silence] Enter Roman Numeral: >> II With a gulp of trepidation, you lift the left door, conserving power. In one heart-racing moment, you realize you've guessed correctly - Bonnie has retreated to lurk elsewhere. The final hour approaches. You scan the camera feeds one last time, ensuring everything is in place to make it through to dawn. The clock strikes 6 AM. The tension breaks - you've survived Night 1. [Claim Victory] [Prepare for Next Shift] >> CLAIM VICTORY As the morning light creeps through the cracks of the security office, you let out a deep sigh of relief. Then, you hear the unmistakable sound of a printer as you're handed your first night's paycheck. Awaiting your next shift, you ponder whether the strategy guide will be enough to see you through the darker hours ahead, when animatronics stalk the shadows more voraciously.

However, I can give you an outline and some pseudocode to get you started on how you might structure such a game in Python. \`\`\`python # Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Shift Survival - Text-Based Game import time # Define the game class class FNAFGame: def __init__(self): self.power = 100 self.time = 0 self.animatronics = { 'Bonnie': False, 'Chica': False, 'Foxy': False, 'Freddy': False } self.isGameOver = False def display_intro(self): print(\\"Welcome to Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Shift Survival\\") # More introductory text here input(\\"Press Enter to start your shift...\\") def monitor_cameras(self): print(\\"You're checking the cameras...\\") # Logic for animatronics' movement and player's response def check_doors(self): print(\\"You're checking the doors...\\") # Logic for checking the doors and responding to animatronics def conserve_power(self): print(\\"You're conserving power...\\") # Logic for power conservation def play_night(self): while not self.isGameOver: self.monitor_cameras() self.check_doors() # More gameplay logic here # Update game state (time, power, etc.) self.time += 1 if self.time >= 6 or self.power <= 0: self.isGameOver = True self.end_night() def end_night(self): if self.power > 0: print(\\"6 AM - You've survived the night!\\") else: print(\\"You've run out of power...

You'd need to flesh out the logic for monitoring cameras, checking doors, and conserving power, as well as handling the animatronics' behavior and the passage of time. Remember, text-based games rely heavily on the player's imagination, so your descriptions and scenarios need to be vivid and engaging. Actual implementation would require more detailed functions and game logic, possibly including random events, a more complex state management system, and a user interface that can handle input and output effectively."},{"prompt":"write a c# script for a 2d game that makes a laser spawn and circle around the boss randomly that lasts for 3 seconds","completion":"Sure!

To find the total magnetic field produced by the entire wire segment, we need to integrate the contribution of each small segment along the wire. Since the wire segment is centered at the origin, we can represent the dl vector element as dl = dl (x=0, y, z), where dl is a differential length element along the wire. Let's assume the wire segment extends from -L/2 to L/2, where L is the total length of the wire. Taking the cross product with the position vector r = (x, y, z) = (2.00 m, 0, 0), we can further simplify the equation. The magnitude of the magnetic field produced by the segment at the specified point can be determined by summing up all the contributions from each small segment along the wire: dB = (μ0 / 4π) * (I * dl x r) / r^3 To solve this integral, we need to assume the specific geometry of the wire segment, such as its shape, size, and orientation."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Patients who suffer from such allergic reactions are meant to carry around two EpiPens, one in case of exposure to an allergen and a second in case the first EpiPen fails or if there is an exceptionally long time between the first injection and emergency medical care. In 2007, Mylan Pharmaceuticals purchased rights to manufacture the EpiPen from Merck, and in the subsequent years it raised the price 400%, leading to public outrage due to price gauging and harm to patients who require EpiPen to save them from life-threatening situations (Markovich, 2021). Much analysis has been done on this case and the economic factors that lead to it, as well as the impacts that it had on patients. It is well understood that Mylan raised the price much more than what would be needed just to only sustain improvements in the product, and that the company harmed patients by raising the price so egregiously. However, an analysis of the ethical conduct of the company and a detailed examination of Mylan’s individual actions has not been done. In the absence of this type of analysis, researchers cannot truly understand what drove Mylan to make its decisions and reflect on what actions influenced its overall attitude. In what follows, I analyze Mylan’s actions through the lens of virtue ethics which allows me to examine how the company failed to put into practice some of the traits that characterize virtuous engineering practice. I will evaluate the morality of the company’s actions that with respect to three of the traits necessary for morally responsible engineers, which are clear and informative communication, cooperation, and willingness to receive criticism. My analysis of Mylan’s actions following its acquisition of EpiPen draws attention to the way the company failed to embody these three virtues of professional engineering. 2 Literature Review There is a large amount of literature about Mylan’s acquisition of the EpiPen and the subsequent increase in EpiPen price over the years that follow. This writing focuses on the facts of the case and the impacts that it has had on patients who require epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs). They also discuss many of the economic factors that contribute to this case as well as the controversy that was shown to the public. However, scholars tend to avoid making ethical judgements of the company’s actions in their writing, and focus on the factual causes and implications of this case. Figure 1. Average wholesale price for EpiPen from 2007 to 2016 (Westermann-Clark, 2018) In Economic considerations in the treatment of systemic allergic reactions, Emma Westermann-Clark gives a background of the epinephrine autoinjector market and describes the major players that affect the costs of this healthcare tool. She goes on to graphically demonstrate the price increase that occurred after Mylan acquired the EpiPen from Merck in 2007, as can be 3 seen in Figure 1. She then discusses how EpiPen has continued to hold the main market share for EAIs, highlighting that the FDA does not allow EpiPen prescriptions to be substituted for other epinephrine autoinjectors at a pharmacy. The article discusses the impact of price on the amount of patients who actually dispense their prescriptions, claiming that, “more than 50% of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned or not filled when the cost exceeds 300 for a 2-pack” (Westermann-Clark, 2018). Finally, Westermann-Clark illustrates how socioeconomic factors impact patient’s access to epinephrine autoinjectors and how the price influences school districts who are required to purchase EAIs for emergency allergic reactions. Hayley Markovich highlights the media framing and presentation of this case to the public through the article titled Severe Allergies, Price Increases, and Supply Shortages: How News and Frames of the 2016 EpiPen Crisis Continue the Conversation of U.S. Pharmaceutical Pricing. By analyzing the different frames by which television news outlets show this story to the public, Markovich desires to better understand how to communicate issues in a way that leads to lasting change. The news segments that she analyzed mainly focused on affordability, attribution of responsibility, morality, and power structures, bringing light to multiple stories of people struggling to afford their children’s lifesaving medication. Markovich also highlights the statements by Mylan Pharmaceuticals and other key industry representatives, stating that, “insurance companies, drug makers, and pharmaceutical benefits managers blamed each other for high medication prices, each refusing to claim responsibility” (Markovich, 2021). Overall, this article highlights the key issues in this case and how it affected patients. Finally, in Health Care Fraud: The Leading Violation of the False Claims Act, Eli Adashi summarizes the leading health care schemes in which taxpayer money was misused in violation of the False Claims Act (FCA). The FCA is an act from 1863 which focuses on the 4 knowingly false or fraudulent submission of claims for payment to government healthcare programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, and institutes a system for damages to be paid for these claims. Adashi writes about how Mylan Pharmaceuticals falsely claimed EpiPen as a generic medicine so that the company would not have to pay rebates to Medicaid, despite there being no FDA approved alternatives to EpiPen (Adashi, 2022). Therefore, Mylan knowingly avoided this program which was put in place to ensure that Medicaid programs are not susceptible to pricegouging. Together, these authors paint a picture of Mylan’s actions through a factual approach. While Adashi and Westermann-Clark highlight the facts of Mylan’s handling of the EpiPen and the effects that it has had on patients, Markovich illustrates the way that the company interacted with the media and criticism they received. However, none of these authors analyzed the company’s actions as a whole that brought it to have such a large impact or attempted to assign moral judgement to Mylan. With a product that has the opportunity to affect millions of patients, it would be helpful to determine what practices can lead to price-gouging at this level. This paper will provide an in-depth look at the actions of Mylan Pharmaceuticals and utilize the virtue ethics framework to form a moral judgement of the company. Conceptual Framework In order to analyze the actions taken by Mylan Pharmaceuticals, I will draw on virtue ethics, which will allow me to assign morality to the actions taken by this company after its purchase of EpiPen. Virtue ethics is an ethical theory that focuses on the values of the actor and emphasizes the development of character traits that make one virtuous (van de Poel & Royakkers, 2011). According to Aristotle, who developed this idea originally, the goal of human 5 action is to strive for eudaimonia, or the highest good to humanity. This requires us to strive to embody positive character traits such as reliability, honesty, and responsibility through all of our actions, which requires humans to utilize our unique reasoning skills to identify how to follow through with these virtues. However, there is no one list of positive virtues within this ethical theory that could be applied to any one situation (van de Poel & Royakkers, 2011). As the development and creators of important technology such as medical devices are often engineers and scientists, Mylan should embody the virtues of morally responsible engineers. For this purpose, I will utilize Michael Pritchard’s list of Virtues for Morally Responsible Engineers, which should influence the ethical creation and distribution of technology. Pritchard notes in the creation of this list that simply having these values may not be enough to certify an engineering project as morally responsible, but lacking them indicates a failure to create simply competent engineering practice (Pritchard, 2001). Throughout this paper, I will determine if Mylan Pharmaceuticals demonstrates these virtues through its actions in its handling of the EpiPen product. I will utilize evidence of repeated actions and statements from the company, which will allow for the judgement of the ethical character of the company. In order to focus this discussion, I will specifically center my 1. Competence 2. Ability to communicate clearly and informatively 3. Cooperativeness (being a good “team player”) 4. Willingness to compromise 5. Perseverance 6. Habit of documenting work thoroughly and clearly 7. Commitment to objectivity 8. Openness to correction (admitting mistakes, acknowledging oversight) 9. Commitment to quality 10. Being imaginative 11. Seeing the “big picture” as well as the details of smaller domains Figure 2. Pritchard’s Virtues for Morally Responsible Engineers (Prichard, 2001) 6 analysis on the virtues of clear and informative communication, cooperation, and willingness to receive criticism. Analysis Mylan Pharmaceuticals showed poor adhesion to the virtues of clear and informative communication, cooperation with government direction and other players in the epinephrine autoinjector market, and willingness to receive criticism. This deficiency in adherence to these values can be seen in the repeated actions taken by this company since its acquisition of EpiPen from Merck in 2007. In order for ethically responsible engineering practice to occur, it is a requirement that an actor follows all of the virtues for a morally responsible engineer, and that even if one value is lacking the actor can be deemed irresponsible (Pritchard, 2001). Although Mylan Pharmaceuticals could be deemed lacking in many of these categories, its failures can specifically be seen through three values. Due to the requirement that an actor must follow all of the virtues for morally responsible engineering, it follows that Mylan Pharmaceuticals was immoral in its handling of the EpiPen. In the following, the text examines each of the three virtues closely and gives evidence of Mylan’s failure to uphold these virtues. Clear and informative communication Mylan failed to communicate with patients and instead released confusing statements to the media during the period of heavy criticism in 2016. In healthcare, effective communication to the patient is paramount to ensuring that a patient can gain proper access to medicines and understand their options in their own healthcare. Therefore, Mylan’s role in communication in regards to the EpiPen is centered around its need to ensure patients understand the product and 7 the cost of what it takes to purchase one. However, Mylan failed to properly communicate the cost of its product while creating fear and the idea that EpiPen was the only option for patients dealing with severe allergies. The first example of this occurring is after the media began covering Mylan’s price increase of the EpiPen. The CEO of Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Heather Brech, accepted “full responsibility” for the price hikes, and claimed that the cost increases funded improvements in the EpiPen device (Silverman, 2016). She stated that the company invested a billion dollars into the product improvements. However, she refused to detail how much of this cost went into the companies lobbying campaign versus real product development, and how these improvements were worth a price increase of 550% for patients. It is apparent that there is a lack of communication and transparency from Mylan in regards to the company’s actions. Despite the CEO’s statement of full responsibility, the company went on in other communications to blame others and attribute the issue to the health care industry as a whole. Bresch claimed that, “the reality is in the brand pharmaceutical market this isn’t an EpiPen issue, this isn’t a Mylan issue, this is a healthcare issue” (Markovich, 2021). She went on to state how the healthcare system is failing patients by allowing them to go to the pharmacy to dispense the drug without knowing what the price will be (Silverman, 2016). Although there are many issues in the American healthcare industry, this statement stands in stark contrast to Bresch’s previous statement of accepting full responsibility. This clearly indicates a lack of clear communication about the product and about where the issue truly stems from. Mylan’s confusing statements contribute to the confusion around the issue of EpiPen pricing as the company refuses to provide clear statements on the reality of the EpiPen price increases. These statements stem from multiple interviews and hearings, showing that this is a 8 repeated pattern for Mylan. Altogether, the comments from Mylan demonstrate a clear poor ability to adhere to the virtue of communication which, according to virtue ethics, can only draw the conclusion that it had acted unethically. Cooperation In addition, Mylan failed to cooperate with other players in the epinephrine injector market and government entities who were attempting to provide better access to EPIs. As a virtue, cooperation means to work with others who have the same goal. Therefore, for a company such as Mylan Pharmaceuticals who has the goal of ensuring that more people have access to epinephrine autoinjectors, it is important to work with others who have the same goal. In this case, Mylan can be seen failing to work with the government and abide by rules that are put in place to ensure equal access to EPIs, as well as fighting to shut down potential competitors. In the American healthcare system, the government’s role is to fill in where there are issues with the market and ensure fairness in the system (Tang, 2004). The government does this in multiple ways, including insuring healthcare assistance through Medicaid and insurance to older people and disabled people through Medicare. In addition, the government has worked to reform the healthcare system through programs such as the Affordable Care Act. One feature of Medicaid is called the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, or MDRP, wherein drug manufacturers help to offset the costs of prescription medicines to Medicaid patients by paying rebates to the government in order for Medicaid patients to get the best price possible for drugs (Centers for Medicaid & Medicaid Services, 2021). These rebates are set as a percentage of the drug’s average manufacturer price, and vary depending on the category of drug, with the largest rebates required for brand-name drugs. 9 However, Mylan failed to cooperate with this program by lying about its product while registering for the MDRP. At the time, EpiPen was listed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a brand name drug and was marketed as such (CNBC, 2017). However, Mylan misclassified the EpiPen as a generic drug to the MDRP in order to avoid paying the larger rebate required for brand name drugs, skirting a program designed to ensure Medicaid was not, “susceptible to price gouging by manufacturers of drugs that were available from only a single source” (Adashi, 2022). In 2009, Mylan was subject to a lawsuit for this misclassification and fined 465 million dollars due to this error. Through this lawsuit, the Department of Justice determined that Mylan did this knowingly. If, as Mylan and its executives have said, providing access to these important live-saving medical devices is important to them, they should be inclined to support such a program and follow the guidelines as required. However, they failed to work with the MDRP and collaborate to ensure that this program with the same goals as them is successful. Another example of Mylan’s failure to cooperate with those who have the same goals as them can be seen through its aggressive fight to keep competition out of the market. In 2015, Teva Pharmaceuticals was poised to launch its generic epinephrine autoinjector and gain approval from the FDA through an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) which allowed them to use EpiPen’s safety data to avoid these safety trials themselves (Carrier, 2017). Mylan fought to delay this ANDA, first with lawsuits and then by filing a citizen petition stating that patients would not be able to understand how to use Teva’s EPI, as it worked differently from the EpiPen. This worked in Mylan’s favor to delay Teva’s generic version of the EpiPen, allowing Mylan to maintain its majority share of the market until 2018 when Teva’s generic EPI finally became available. 10 As I have shown, Mylan provides poor cooperation with those who desire to provide access to EpiPens. Some may say that EpiPen manufacturers can set the price of the device to as high as they need and fight to keep its product unchallenged, because Mylan offers programs to aid low-income patients in receiving its EpiPen. If uninsured patients apply, they can receive two EpiPens for free, so Mylan must be serious about providing for patients. However, this view fails to consider that a large portion of patients are able to afford insurance, making them ineligible for this program, but still have high deductibles. Many Americans have insurance for emergencies, but still must pay large amounts of money to reach their deductible and gain any coverage from their insurance provider (Willingham, 2016). Therefore, these are the people who are largely suffering from the EpiPen prices. Mylan clearly failed to cooperate with Teva and fought against its generic version of EpiPen being approved as hard as it could. Mylan also failed to cooperate with a program specifically designed to aid low-income patients in receiving live-saving drugs. It worked to avoid government requirements and to maintain exclusivity for its own gain. These actions show repeated inability to work towards the common good and demonstrate a lack of adhesion to the virtue of cooperation. Therefore, Mylan acted unethically as it lacks one of the core virtues for morally responsible engineering practice. Open to criticism Finally, Mylan fought heavily against any criticism that was levied against them. The ability to receive criticism with acceptance and understanding is an essential trait to one designing and marketing a product, as there are always room for improvements that may not be obvious to the originator. This virtue can be observed by taking criticism and either adjusting 11 one’s actions accordingly or seriously evaluating the criticism for future actions. Through Mylan’s actions, it is clear that it failed to take the high amounts of criticism and change its actions or product, and in some cases attempting to shut down all criticisms instead. Before Mylan acquired the EpiPen in 2007, the device was manufactured by Merck and costs for the product was approximately 114 for a two-pack, which is the standard amount to for patients to receive from the pharmacy at one time, in case one EpiPen fails (Willingham, 2016). However, by 2016, the price for the EpiPen was increased to 500 or more, leading to a large media backlash and heavy criticism that same year. This criticism was heavily directed towards Mylan for price gouging and depriving patients of medicine that is essential if they were to come in contact with an allergen and in turn have a severe allergic reaction. The backlash was not for no reason either, as many low-income patients were unable to fill their prescriptions, with evidence citing that more than half of EpiPen prescriptions are not filled by patients once the cost of a 2-pack exceeds 300 (Westermann-Clark, 2018). During this period of heavy criticism, Mylan executives took to news outlets to blame anyone other than themselves for this issue (Markovich, 2022). In addition, since the criticism, the company has continued to raise the cost of its EpiPen, and now a pack can cost even up to 730.33 (Westermann-Clark, 2018). This clearly demonstrates a failure to respond to criticism from the public and patients who need EpiPen. In a different manner, Mylan Pharmaceuticals also shut down criticism forcefully. In 2009, the Pittsburg Post-Gazette wrote an article about poor quality control procedures at Mylan’s plan in Morgantown, Pennsylvania, detailing how workers routinely ignored warnings about potential manufacturing problems. In return, Mylan filed two defamation lawsuits, one 12 claiming that the Post-Gazette misappropriated trade secrets and another claiming that the PostGazette distorted the facts in its article (Adams, 2009). These lawsuits were later dropped. These examples clearly demonstrate Mylan’s pattern of avoiding criticism and shutting it down where possible, instead of utilizing criticism to improve its work. Therefore, it failed to be open to criticism and, accordingly, lack this virtue. As has been previously stated, the lacking of one virtue allows for them to be deemed immoral according to virtue ethics theory. Conclusion Through detailed evidence of Mylan’s actions since 2007, it is possible to judge its actions and the character of the company. These actions show Mylan lacked in three character traits that are essential to morally responsible engineers: clear and informative communication, cooperation, and willingness to receive criticism. If analyzed through a virtue ethics framework, Mylan acted unethically because it failed to demonstrate virtues that would have been illustrated by a virtuous actor. A benevolent healthcare system is essential to building a thriving and successful society, and ensures that citizens are kept healthy. However, many healthcare companies are driven by their own profit motives and neglect the causes that brought them into existence in the first place, namely providing access to medicines. By evaluating what brought one pharmaceutical company to greed, the virtues which it lacked can be emphasized and upheld as future engineers enter into the workforce. Keeping these virtues in mind can help healthcare systems improve and deliver on their promises to help patients. Viatris, the drugmaker previously known as Mylan, announced on Monday that it had agreed to pay 264 million to settle a class-action lawsuit that alleged the company was involved in an illegal scheme to monopolize the market for epinephrine auto-injector devices known as EpiPens, which are used to treat severe allergic reactions. The proposed settlement, which needs to be approved by a judge, would resolve a legal battle that began after Mylan, in 2016, raised the price for a pack of two EpiPens to 608 from 100, the price since 2007, according to court documents. In the lawsuit, a group of plaintiffs made up of consumers, health insurance companies and other third-party payers alleged that by drastically raising the price of EpiPens, the drugmaker was “unlawfully exercising its monopoly power,” according to a complaint. “Were the price increases attributable to market conditions, increases in manufacturing costs or shortages in the supply of epinephrine?” the complaint said. “Absolutely not. They were driven solely by unaccountable executives and companies who sought to profit off of human misery and fear.” Many people involved in the lawsuit had paid thousands of dollars for EpiPens over the years, including a mother from Arizona who had paid 2,475 out of pocket for her son who is allergic to tree nuts and peanuts, and a father from Delaware who spent more than 1,100 on EpiPens for his son who is allergic to milk, eggs and peanuts, according to the lawsuit. EpiPens are made by two subsidiaries of Pfizer — King Pharmaceuticals and Meridian Medical Technologies — and are sold by Viatris. In July, Pfizer and its subsidiaries settled its part of the lawsuit for 345 million, and denied any wrongdoing. In its quarterly earnings report on Monday, Viatris said that the company “maintains that it acted lawfully and pro-competitively and the settlement contains no admission of liability.” “The board of directors believes that this settlement is in the best interests of the company and its stakeholders,” the report said. “The resolution of these indirect purchaser cases will allow the company to move forward and continue focusing on its strategic priorities and its mission of empowering people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life.” Editors’ Picks ‘Saturday Night Live’ Says Goodbye to George Santos Martin Scorsese’s Unwise Guys Flamboyant as Ever, ’70s-Style Desserts Are Making a Comeback Neither Viatris officials nor lawyers representing the company immediately responded to a request for comment on Monday night. Our business reporters. Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover. Lynn Sarko, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement that he urged consumers and third-party payers who paid for EpiPens to learn more about the settlement at a website where claims can be filed. “We are pleased that the EpiPen antitrust litigation is now concluded,” Paul Geller, another lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement, adding that the settlement is subject to court approval. The lawsuit also alleged that the drugmaker misclassified EpiPens under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to save hundreds of millions of dollars in rebates, and that it intervened in regulatory proceedings to delay competitors from entering the market. The price jump in 2016 drew widespread outrage, especially among parents of children with allergies. Thousands of people signed a petition urging Congress to intervene. After protests over the company’s raising the price of EpiPens in 2016, Mylan, as Viatris was then known, introduced a generic version of its own product. But it was announced with a wholesale list price of 300 for a pack of two, half the price of the brand-name EpiPen. In 2016, Mylan reached a 465 million settlement with the Justice Department and other government agencies over allegations that the drugmaker had overcharged Medicaid for the treatment by improperly classifying it as a generic drug. EpiPens As the CEO of the drug maker that sells the EpiPen allergy-reaction injector defended the company’s six-fold price increases before Congress last week, it’s appalling to see that Heather Bresch took no fault. The company’s price hikes on a life-saving drug is clearly unethical if we take a closer look. EpiPen has gone from 100 for a two-pack in 2009 to 608 today. Usually, companies would be applauded for the ability to create revenue through such pricing power. But when it comes to life-saving drugs, consumers interpret these significant increases as the producer profiteering off a person’s life or death need. This is (not) unlike what happened at Turing Pharmaceuticals last year when the company increased the price of Daraprim from roughly 15 to 750. Like many, I had to ask: are these prices ethical? In the book, The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably, the authors present a five-step test to determine if a price is ethical. Here’s a look at how Mylan’s Epipens would perform under the test: Test #1: the exchange (transaction) is ethical when the price is paid voluntarily. The buyer is aware of how much the item costs and voluntarily completes the transaction. For this level, Mylan has passed at an elementary understanding. People are still buying EpiPens. Test #2: The buyer is provided ample information about the product. This expectation comes with any purchase. The seller is not misleading consumers or omitting crucial information. Smokers still purchase cigarettes, despite the full disclosure of health risks. For this level, Mylan still passes the test. Test #3 and #4 are not as simple, so let’s come back to them later in this article. Test #5: The exchange must present equal access to goods regardless of ability to cover the cost. Consumers have access to discounts based on financial need and Mylan also provides free EpiPens to schools and funds activities related to allergy awareness. They continue to pass the test for now. OK, now let’s get back to Test #3 and #4. Here is where consumer outrage and the case for unethical behavior becomes stronger. Test #3: This stipulates that sellers cannot exploit a buyer’s essential needs. Test #4: This states the price must be justified by costs. There should be no excessive, unjustified profits on essentials. For example, if a person was having a heart attack and needed emergency treatment, hospitals would first treat the patient before collecting a deposit upfront to ensure the patient can pay for their services. In 2011, the list price for the EpiPen was 165. At that time, there were no competitors in the market and the product was off patent, meaning the patent protection had expired. Further, there was consistent demand due to the product’s shelf life of one year. Customers had to replace their EpiPens annually. In 2012, the list price increased 32% with no new competitors entering the market. However, this increase could have resulted from more R&D spending or an increase in raw materials costs. Regardless, the price was elastic and consumers continued to purchase the drug. By 2013, Sanofi announced its entry into the market. Their price hovered near that of Mylan’s, so it would appear the price was justified by cost. Had Sanofi entered with a lower or higher price, this justification would have been tougher to sell. Mylan responded by increasing their price a little more, which likely came from a desire to differentiate themselves as the premier brand with superior products. At this point, Mylan was still within the ethical constraints put forth above. This changed when Sanofi, Mylan’s sole competitor, was forced into a product recall and left the market. Mylan once again had a monopoly. Typically, in this situation, the price would remain the same or increase nominally with inflation and other standard considerations. Instead, Mylan increased the price from 300 to 600 over two years. In 2015, Mylan reported a net profit margin of 8.9%, but some speculate the margin for the EpiPen was closer to 55%, thus breaking the ethical constraints of Test #3 and #4. While individual consumers may not have had a voice or recourse, the market did. Mylan may have improved its margins and ultimately driven higher returns and shareholder value, but within a week the price increase cost the company 3 billion in market cap and a stock tank of over 12% in 5 days. They attempted to rectify the issue and announced a generic brand of the EpiPen with a list price of 300. Because of this misstep, though, every price change now will come under extreme scrutiny. The ethics of pricing is a minefield for any company to navigate. Nominal price increases are annoyances to customers and consumers, but they—for the most part—will not be met with extreme criticism. As long as a company is transparent about price increases and can demonstrate that such a change is justified—or at least has the consumers’ faith that this is true—they should be able to avoid a public maelstrom. If the Mylan debacle demonstrates anything, it shows that even in markets that have little pricing regulation and transparency, pricing moves must be carefully considered and communicated in a way that demonstrates ethical behavior in the best interest of both the consumer and the company.

Economic considerations in the treatment of systemic allergic reactions Emma Westermann-Clark,1,2 Amber N Pepper,1,2 and Richard F Lockey1,2 Author information Copyright and License information PMC Disclaimer Go to: Abstract Epinephrine is a life-saving medication used to treat systemic allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) are expensive and worldwide availability is limited. Epinephrine prefilled syringes and epinephrine kits are potentially lower-cost alternatives to EAIs. Advantages, disadvantages, and costs of available products are discussed. The socioeconomic factors impacting access to EAIs are described. Keywords: epinephrine, anaphylaxis, cost, price, autoinjector Go to: Introduction Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for systemic allergic reactions (SARs) to foods, insect stings or bites, medications, and other allergens. The early use of epinephrine in SARs can be life-saving; delayed use has been associated with death.1–3 Cox et al updated the World Allergy Organization (WAO) grading system for SARs as summarized in Table 1 to clarify the early signs and symptoms of an SAR and to encourage early use of epinephrine.4 The term “SAR” applies to all grades with the term “anaphylaxis” also appropriate for grade 4 or 5 reactions. Table 1 Proposed modification of the 2010 World Allergy Organization grading system Grading system for SARs Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 Grade 5 Anaphylaxis Symptom(s)/sign(s) from 1 organ system present Cutaneous • Urticaria and/or erythema-warmth and/or pruritus, other than localized at the injection site And/or • Tingling, or itching of the lips* or • Angioedema (not laryngeal) Or Upper respiratory • Nasal symptoms (eg, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, and/or nasal congestion) And/or • Throat-clearing (itchy throat) And/or • Cough not related to bronchospasm Or Conjunctival • Erythema, pruritus, or tearing Or Other • Nausea • Metallic taste Symptom(s)/sign(s) from ≥2 organ symptoms listed in grade 1 Lower airway • Mild bronchospasm, eg, cough, wheezing, shortness of breath which responds to treatment And/or Gastrointestinal • Abdominal cramps* and/or vomiting/diarrhea Other • Uterine cramps • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grade 1 would be included Lower airway • Severe bronchospasm, eg, not responding or worsening in spite of treatment And/or Upper airway • Laryngeal edema with stridor • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grades 1 or 3 would be included Lower or upper airway • Respiratory failure And/or Cardiovascular • Collapse/hypotension^ And/or Loss of consciousness (vasovagal excluded) • Any symptom(s)/sign(s) from grades 1, 3, or 4 would be included Open in a separate window Notes: The final grade of the reaction is not determined until the event is over, regardless of the medication administered to treat the reaction. The final report should include the first symptom(s)/sign(s) and the time of onset after the causative agent exposure and a suffix reflecting if and when epinephrine was or was not administered: a, ≤5 min; b, >5 min to ≤10 min; c, >10 to ≤20 min; d, >20 min; z, epinephrine not administered. Final report: Grade 1-5; a-d, or z; First symptom(s)/sign(s); Time of onset of first symptom(s)/signs(s). Case example. Within 10 min of receiving an AIT injection, a patient develops generalized urticaria followed by a tickling sensation in the posterior pharynx. Intramuscular epinephrine is administered within 5 min of symptoms(s)/sign(s) resulting in complete resolution of the reaction. The final report would be: Grade 2; a; Urticaria; 10 min. *Application-site reactions would be considered local reactions. Oral mucosa symptoms, such as pruritus, after SLIT administration, or warmth and/or pruritus at a subcutaneous immunotherapy injection site would be considered a local reaction. However, tingling or itching of the lips or mouth could be interpreted as a SAR if the known allergen, eg, peanut, is inadvertently placed into the mouth or ingested in a subject with a history of a peanut-induced SAR. Gastrointestinal tract reactions after SLIT or OIT would also be considered local reactions, unless they occur with other systemic manifestations. SLIT or OIT reactions associated with gastrointestinal tract and other systemic manifestations would be classified as SARs. SLIT local reactions would be classified according to the WAO grading system for SLIT local reactions.33 A fatal reaction would not be classified in this grading system but rather reported as a serious adverse event. ^Hypotension is defined per the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network Expert Panel criteria34: “Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to several hours). A) Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic blood pressure. Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as follows: 1 mo to 1 y: <70 mm Hg, 1–10 y: <70 mm Hg + [2 × age], 11–17 y: <90 mm Hg. B) Adults: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline.

Epinephrine autoinjectors (EAIs) were developed in the 1970s and were first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1987 with the EpiPen® (Mylan, Canonsburg, PA, USA). EAIs available in the USA include: EpiPen; epinephrine injection, United States Pharmacopeia autoinjector, generic (Mylan); epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector (Impax Generics, Hayward, CA, USA); and Auvi-Q® (Kaléo, Richmond, VA, USA). The annual direct costs in year 2010 in the USA for EAIs are estimated to be 294 million, accounting for about 25% of the 1.2 billion annual cost to treat SARs including anaphylaxis.5,6 The average wholesale price (AWP) of each EAI is included in Table 2, except for the Auvi-Q. Accurate wholesale pricing for the Auvi-Q is not available as it is distributed through a single specialty pharmacy network. The complexity of drug pricing is beyond the scope of this article. Costs for the EpiPen were relatively stable until Mylan acquired this product from Merck (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) in 2007. The AWP since that time for two EpiPens has increased 545% from 113.27 to 730.33.4 This price increase persists even after accounting for inflation (Figure 1).7,8 Although the out-of-pocket expenses for individual subjects may have decreased since the public outcry about EpiPen costs in 2016, the effective date of the most recent AWP available is May 16, 2016 and does not reflect the impact of price cuts or patient assistance programs.7 An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc. Object name is jaa-11-153Fig1.jpg Figure 1 AWP for the EpiPen® 2001–2016.

Abbreviations: AWP, average wholesale price; ea, each; NDC: national drug code. Use of the AWP is controversial, but it is often used as a proxy for societal cost in cost-effectiveness analyses.9 An economic analysis published in 2011 utilized the 2006–2007 AWP of the EpiPen to estimate the annual cost of EAIs for food-induced SARs.10 According to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research good research practices guidelines from 2010: Pharmaceutical prices used in the vast majority of cost-effectiveness analyses are either based on AWPs in the USA or government-negotiated prices in Europe. The former are not only imperfect measures of actual prices paid (e.g., ignoring discounts and rebates), but may also greatly overestimate societal opportunity costs because of the implicit inclusion of producer surplus created through patent-protected monopoly pricing.11 In summary, AWP is used as an approximation for societal drug costs, despite its limitations. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Economics Resource Center (HERC) discusses the challenge of determining medication costs for research purposes. The HERC states, “We recommend using 121% of the drug costs reported in the Federal Supply Schedule, 152% of the VA cost, or 64% of AWP. To find the cost of a generic label prescription drug, we recommend using 27% of AWP.”9 Federal Supply Schedule prices are publicly available.12 Several factors limit the ability of newer products to garner and maintain a better market share versus Mylan’s EpiPen. First, the EpiPen has name recognition. Second, training for the use of each device is different. To illustrate, the epinephrine injection, USP autoinjector from Impax Generics requires the removal of two caps rather than just one. Although learning to use a new device can be challenging, novel design elements can improve safety and usability. An example is that the Auvi-Q has unique features including its rectangular shape intended to fit into a pocket, a retractable needle, and voice instructions. Third, insurance coverage differs for each EAI. According to the Managed Markets Insight and Technology database, the EpiPen has unrestricted access for 61% of commercial lives among 4624 commercial health plans.13 In contrast, Auvi-Q has unrestricted access for “19% of commercial lives in all locations” among these same commercial health plans.8 Even though Auvi-Q is not covered by many commercial insurance plans, the manufacturer offers it with 0 copayment to all commercially insured and Medicaid patients through a specialty pharmacy network distributor. Fourth, EAIs are rated “BX” by the FDA indicating that “data that have been reviewed by the Agency are insufficient to determine therapeutic equivalence” and when ordered may not be substituted by a pharmacist, one for another.14 The impact of copayments, coupons, and patient assistance programs on prices that subjects pay at the pharmacy counter requires further research. Pourang et al found that copayments did not affect the likelihood of an EAI being dispensed once it was prescribed in the Kaiser Permanente Health Maintenance Organization.15 However, while the authors indicate that nearly 30% of copayments exceeded 30, they did not consider higher copayments. Data are not available on prescription:dispense ratios for subjects with exceedingly high copayments or for uninsured and underinsured subjects who may pay retail prices. More than 50% of EpiPen prescriptions are abandoned or not filled when the cost exceeds 300 for a 2-pack.5 Two generic EAIs manufactured by Mylan have an AWP of 375. Two generic EAIs manufactured by Impax Generics have an AWP of 494.01. Patients with any commercial insurance plan or Medicaid receive Auvi-Q for 0 copayment through the specialty pharmacy network, ASPN Pharmacies LLC (200 Park Avenue, Suite 300, Florham Park, NJ 07932, 973-295-3289). All uninsured subjects who make <100,000 annually have no copayment for Auvi-Q; uninsured subjects whose incomes exceed 100,000 pay no more than 360 for Auvi-Q. Socioeconomic factors impact access to EAIs. Children from high-income versus low-income homes are 8.35 times more likely to be prescribed EAIs.16 Medicaid-enrolled children are less likely to receive EAIs prior to arrival at an emergency department.17 In another study, Caucasian versus non-Caucasian children were more likely to receive epinephrine early during an SAR.18 Early use of epinephrine was defined as epinephrine administered before arrival to the emergency department. Owning an EAI greatly increased the odds of early epinephrine treatment (odds ratio 12.67, 95% CI: 4.46–35.96). The authors did not assess insurance status but indicate that this finding suggests that there might be an economic influence on access to EAIs.18 Fleming et al examined the out-of-pocket costs for medications associated with food allergy and found higher costs for Caucasian and higher-income subjects.18 They hypothesize that Medicaid-enrolled children may have lower out-of-pocket costs, that is, lower copayments. To reduce or eliminate insurance copayments, Fromer suggests that epinephrine be classified as a preventive medicine by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).5 Decision analysis software (TreeAge Pro, Williamstown, MA, USA) has been used to evaluate the cost of generic EAIs versus the EpiPen using a model that tracked spending for individual subjects over 20 years, with the assumption that each subject needs two 2-packs yearly, one each for home and school or work.19 The cost for the EpiPen over a 20-year model duration totals 58,667 (95% CI: 57,745–59,588) versus 45,588 for the generic EAI (95% CI: 44,873–46,304). The model also incorporates other food allergy-related costs, such as specialist visits, grocery costs, and loss of work time for parents of food-allergic children. These costs are assumed to be the same for all subjects regardless of the type of EAI prescribed. The price of EAIs also affects school districts and communities. The Michigan legislature mandated that all public schools stock EAIs. It estimated the cost for two EAI 2-packs, one adult and one pediatric, at 140, while the “recently reported costs for commercial sources” was 1200, according to the authors of the article. The annual calculated cost to Michigan public schools based on these two cost estimates ranges from 565,460 to 4,846,800.20 A 2007 WAO survey of its House of Delegates indicates that EAIs are available in 59% of 44 countries surveyed.21 Those without EAIs employed other methods for the self-administration of epinephrine.22 These include the use of ampules of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) with an empty 1 cc syringe to be drawn up as needed or prefilled syringes containing various amounts of epinephrine. Both options are much less expensive than EAIs; for example, a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) (Hospira, Lake Forest, IL, USA) had an AWP of 2.52 and retail price of ~12 in 2016.7 Epinephrine ampules may not be available in all countries. Both options also allow for tailored dosing of epinephrine, above or below the standard 0.15 or 0.3 mg doses contained in most FDA-approved EAIs. This may be beneficial for children weighing <15 kg (33 pounds) or for large or obese subjects. Of note, in November 2017, the FDA approved an infant version of the Auvi-Q, Auvi-q 0.1mg, for children weighing 7.5–15 kg (16.5–33 pounds). It has a shorter needle and a smaller dose of epinephrine (0.1 mg versus 0.15 mg contained in other “junior” products). Market forces appear to influence the cost of EAIs. For example, some US companies are offering low-cost alternatives. Symjepi™ (Adamis, San Diego, CA, USA) is an epinephrine prefilled syringe (EPS) that contains 0.3 mg of epinephrine, with a user-friendly design. It was approved by the FDA in June 2017 for subjects 30 kg (66 pounds) or more and is expected to be available at a lower cost than the current EAIs. A “junior” version is expected to follow. The concept of prefilled syringes is not new. The Ana-Kit® (Hollister-Stier Laboratories, Spokane, WA, USA) consisted of a syringe filled with 1 mL of epinephrine 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) housed in a protective case for subcutaneous injection before it was removed from the US market.23,24 The Ana-Kit syringe had 0.1 mL graduations so that smaller doses could be administered depending on the subject’s age. The instructions recommended the following doses: “Adults and children over 12 years: 0.3 mL; 6–12 years: 0.2 mL; 2–6 years: 0.15 mL; infants to 2 years: 0.05–0.1 mL.”25 An appropriate dose could be administered by pushing the syringe plunger until it stopped. A second dose could be administered as appropriate, after rotating the rectangular plunger ¼ turn to the right, to line up with a rectangular slot in the syringe.25 An advantage of the prefilled Symjepi syringe is that it is housed in a dark blue plastic encasement to protect the epinephrine from ultraviolet light degradation. Epinephrine degrades with exposure to ultraviolet light, oxygen in ambient air, and excessive heat.26–28 EPSs stored at room temperature in a pencil box maintain acceptable US Pharmacopeia concentrations (90%–115% of label claim), pH, and sterility for 3 months.22 The stability is limited to 2 months in high-temperature and low-humidity climates.22,29 In addition, some physicians and other health care professionals provide subjects with prefilled syringes wrapped in aluminum foil.28,30 These can be transported in a crush-resistant eyeglass case. Snap Medical Industries (Dubin, OH, USA) has developed EpinephrineSnap-V® (a kit containing a vial of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes) and the EpinephrineSnap convenience kit (a kit containing an ampule of epinephrine 1:1000 [1 mg/mL] and empty syringes). The Focus Health Group, located in Knoxville, TN, USA, has been contracted to commercialize these products. The AWP of this product is 1567 although information from company officials states that the average price of EpinephrineSnap is 80 and the EpinephrineSnap-V is 130, with discounted group purchasing organization pricing available (Personal communication, November 1, 2017). Use of these options may not be as practical as is an EAI. The reason is that an epinephrine ampule or vial with an empty syringe requires more skill to properly draw up the epinephrine and administer it under emergency circumstances. Parents of individuals with a history of an SAR take longer to draw up epinephrine from an ampule (average 142±13 seconds) compared to emergency department nurses (29±0.09 seconds; p<0.05).31 The epinephrine dose drawn up by parents also ranged 40-fold as compared to twofold for emergency department nurses.31 The EpinephrineSnap products are geared toward use by emergency medical technicians and other health care professionals rather than individual subjects. The rising cost of EAIs has made self-administered epinephrine potentially unavailable to some subjects. There are no data on deaths attributed to inability to afford EAIs. Lower-cost alternatives such as EPSs and epinephrine kits are entering the US market. EAIs have advantages, such as ease of use, but they are expensive. More research is needed on the complexity of drug pricing and on the optimal methods to determine individual and societal costs. Classifying EAIs as USPSTF preventive medicines could improve access by reducing or eliminating copayments.

Write about 1700 words","completion":"Title: Ethical and Economic Analysis of EpiPen Pricing Practices Introduction The dramatic price increase of EpiPens by Mylan Pharmaceuticals has incited significant public concern and prompted an examination of the ethical and economic underpinnings of pharmaceutical pricing strategies. An EpiPen, a lifesaving epinephrine autoinjector essential for individuals suffering from severe allergies, epitomizes the intersection of public health and corporate profit. This paper intends to scrutinize Mylan's EpiPen pricing from both ethical and economic perspectives to establish the adequacy of these practices, and to determine the extent to which this pricing can be justified. Through an analysis of the company's actions, public response, and available alternatives, alongside principles drawn from IB business and management concepts, a comprehensive understanding will emerge. The thesis posits that the exorbitant pricing of EpiPens by Mylan is both ethically and economically inadequate, failing to meet the standards of corporate social responsibility and fair market competition. Body Paragraphs Ethical Considerations Ethically, price-setting for pharmaceutical products, especially life-saving ones, underscores the moral responsibility of pharmaceutical companies. The principles of virtue ethics assert that these entities must exemplify virtues such as honesty, transparency, and a commitment to societal welfare. Mylan's decision to increase the cost of the EpiPen by 400% since its acquisition in 2007 raises questions about its commitment to these virtues. The lack of clear communication regarding the necessity for price hikes, as characterized by the CEO's conflicting statements and lack of detailed rationale, undermines the company's integrity and accountability. Furthermore, Mylan's engagement in tactics to delay the entry of generic competitors, such as Teva Pharmaceuticals, reveals a lack of cooperativeness and openness to criticism. By obstructing access to affordable alternatives, Mylan disregarded public welfare and prioritized profit. This practice conflicts with the normative ethical frameworks such as Kantian ethics, which stipulate acting in a way that treats humanity, whether in oneself or another, always as an end and never as a means to an end. Depriving patients of affordable medication instrumental to their survival can be interpreted as treating them as means to financial ends. Economic Adequacy From an economic standpoint, the adequacy of Mylan's pricing strategy can be assessed through the lens of market competition and product positioning. According to Porter's Five Forces, the level of rivalry amongst existing competitors in the market, the threat of new entry, and the bargaining power of buyers are critical factors determining a firm's strategic conduct. Mylan's monopolistic hold on the market and the absence of substitutes empowered the company to impose exorbitant prices without immediate repercussions in terms of reduced demand. However, examining the utility of EpiPens via cost–benefit analysis reveals significant economic inadequacies. The elevated prices result in reduced accessibility for lower-income patients and strain on the healthcare system. Although Mylan provided discounts and free products to schools, these measures do not sufficiently mitigate the broader economic impact of the price increase, particularly for uninsured and underinsured individuals. According to IB business management concepts, companies should consider the long-term implications of pricing strategies, factoring in ethical considerations and corporate social responsibility. Mylan's short-term profit maximization approach seemingly ignored the potential long-term consequences, including reputational damage and potential loss of customer loyalty, which could outweigh the immediate financial gains. Alternatives to Mylan's EpiPen The presence of alternative solutions, such as epinephrine prefilled syringes (EPS), which offer a cost-effective and potentially more tailored option for patients, accentuates the economic inadequacy of Mylan's pricing. With the FDA's approval of more generic EAI versions and the introduction of lower-cost alternatives like Symjepi, market dynamics are poised to shift, potentially reducing EpiPen's market share and impacting Mylan's profitability. Healthcare economics dictate that fair pricing aligns with the value provided to consumers and the broader society. Although Mylan defends its EpiPen pricing by referencing research and development expenses, the lack of substantial enhancements to the product and the company's dubious accounting under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program suggest an economic misalignment between the product's cost and its value. Conclusion In conclusion, the analysis demonstrates that Mylan's pricing practices for the EpiPen fail to meet ethical and economic adequacy. Ethically, Mylan's actions disregard foundational moral principles by putting lives at risk for the sake of profit, demonstrating a failure in corporate social responsibility. Economically, the substantial price increases are not justifiable when considering competition, demand elasticity, and the availability of cheaper yet effective alternatives. The company's strategy exemplifies a short-term focus on profit maximization at the expense of long-term sustainability and responsible corporate conduct. This paper advocates for a more equitable approach to pharmaceutical pricing that considers patient welfare, fosters market competition, and reflects the true value delivered to consumers."},{"prompt":"Make the paragraphs longer and without the subtitles, use all the evidence I gave u, which is a lot","completion":"The astronomical surge in the cost of EpiPens, a critical medical device for those facing life-threatening allergic reactions, has sparked a heated debate around the ethical and economic justifications of such pricing by Mylan Pharmaceuticals. The EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, remains the cornerstone for emergency allergic reaction management, and for many, the difference between life and death. Since Mylan's acquisition of the EpiPen rights from Merck in 2007 and subsequent 400% price hike, public outrage has been fueled not only by the spiraling cost but by the practices that suggest a stark departure from virtuous principles essential for morally responsible companies, particularly those operating within the sensitive pharmaceuticals domain. Scrutinizing Mylan's actions through the lens of virtue ethics becomes critical, given that virtuous traits such as clear and informative communication, cooperation, and openness to criticism form the bedrock of ethical business conduct, especially in life-dependent industries. Various reports and statements, including from Heather Bresch, Mylan's CEO, indicated mixed messaging. On one hand, she took \\"full responsibility\\" for the price increases, which were defended as necessary to fund product improvements, stating that the company invested a billion dollars into enhancing the EpiPen. On the other hand, a shift in blame was noteworthy when the issue was framed as a systematic failure of the healthcare industry, a claim that both transferred responsibility and obfuscated the direct rationale for the price boosts. In times of scrutiny, Mylan's public interaction was, at best, erratic and, at worst, deceptive, thereby failing to embody the virtue of effective communication expected of ethical engineering practice. When it comes to the economic analysis of the EpiPen case, the comprehension of pricing strategies is nuanced. Theories of market competition and product positioning, underscored by Porter's Five Forces, imply that Mylan, facing little competition due to the FDA's non-allowance of pharmacy substitution and holding patents that deterred generic alternatives, was able to exert monopolistic control over the EpiPen. This dominance in the market empowered Mylan to set extortionate prices, a decision buttressed by the inelastic demand for the indispensable medical device. However, such a strategy fails to consider the economic principle that prices should, ideally, be aligned with the value provided to consumers. The ethical and economic inadequacies of Mylan's EpiPen pricing are further accentuated when considering the availability of cost-effective alternatives such as epinephrine prefilled syringes (EPS) and the entrance of generic competitors into the market. Epinephrine, the life-saving medication at the heart of this discourse, has been made available in various forms, such as the EpinephrineSnap product line at substantially lower prices, challenging the justification of Mylan's high pricing model. These options provide a stark contrast to the inflated costs of EpiPens and represent a valid challenge to Mylan's economic rationale. Advances in the availability of EAIs have demonstrated that effective drug delivery methods do not necessarily demand exorbitant prices. The recent introduction of products like Symjepi, an FDA-approved EPS, offer a less costly solution while retaining user-friendly design features, suggesting that competitive market forces might eventually correct the inflated EpiPen pricing. However, the negative economic and social repercussions stemming from Mylan's pricing strategies cannot be overlooked, including the significant burden on uninsured and underinsured patients and the strain placed on healthcare systems and school districts required to stock EAIs for emergencies. Analyzing the impact on pricing from an IB business and management perspective, it becomes clear that the sustainability of a company's pricing strategy must be evaluated within a framework of corporate social responsibility. This approach integrates economic success with respect for societal needs and principles of equity. Mylan's overemphasis on financial gains, while neglecting the social repercussions of its pricing, illustrates a profound oversight of fundamental ethical considerations essential for sustainable business operation. The broader implications of such actions, when viewed through a cost-benefit lens, reveal potential risks to the company's long-term viability, including reputational damage and legal ramifications as observed in the class-action lawsuit Mylan faced, leading to a multifold settlement over allegations of monopolistic practices and exploitation. In conclusion, Mylan's EpiPen pricing strategy, when meticulously analyzed, displays a compelling failure to measure up to both ethical and economic standards. The lack of transparent communication, reluctance to engage in fair market competition, and disregard for the pressing need for accessibility to vital medication highlight a profound ethical lapse. Economically, the strategy is short-sighted, underestimating the market forces that could eventually realign prices more suitably with social welfare and long-term corporate health. The paths forward are clear: regulatory oversight needs to be stringent, ensuring that pharmaceutical companies cannot wield monopolistic power to the detriment of public health, while companies themselves must adopt a balanced scorecard approach, ensuring that financial objectives do not overshadow their social responsibilities and ethical obligations. The case of Mylan and the EpiPen stands as a cautionary tale, emphasizing the importance of aligning pricing strategies with virtuous conduct and fair market practices."},{"prompt":"Collapse folder.

These concepts will enhance the discussion on the ethical and economic adequacy of Mylan's EpiPen pricing strategy. Marketing planning involves understanding and aligning with consumer needs. Within the IB framework, the marketing mix, particularly the aspects of product and price, is crucial for business success. Mylan's strategies after acquiring the rights to the EpiPen seem to have disregarded critical aspects of the marketing mix. The substantial price increases signified a failure to consider the affordability and accessibility of the product for consumers, which goes against the principle of satisfying customer needs and maintaining long-term market demand. Price-setting in marketing planning should ensure that products remain within reach for all segments of the market. By pricing the EpiPen out of reach for many consumers, Mylan not only demonstrated poor ethical judgment but also showed a lack of foresight in anticipating market backlash and demand elasticity. Stakeholder analysis requires companies to consider the interests and influence of all parties affected by their operations. A stakeholder-focused approach would necessitate that Mylan take into account the perspectives of patients, healthcare providers, insurers, and government healthcare programs. The sheer necessity of the EpiPen for the well-being of patients should have placed them at the forefront of Mylan's pricing decisions. Instead, the pursuit of profit appears to have overshadowed the broader impact on stakeholders, leading to significant reputation damage and legal challenges, as well as jeopardizing relationships with key stakeholders, who felt that Mylan exploited its market position at the expense of public health. Lastly, corporate culture, which encompasses the shared values, beliefs, and practices within an organization, significantly influences its operations and ethics. A corporate culture centered on integrity and social responsibility would guide a company to prioritize patient access to vital medications over excessive profit margins. Mylan's culture, as inferred from its pricing practices, seemed to prioritize revenue growth, even to the detriment of patient care - a misalignment that has become increasingly untenable in the face of public and regulatory scrutiny. An ethically sound corporate culture would have prevented the reputational damage and loss of trust that Mylan experienced due to its pricing strategy. In conclusion, the examination of Mylan's approach to the EpiPen pricing through the lens of marketing planning, stakeholder analysis, and corporate culture reinforces the thesis that the exorbitant price of EpiPens is neither ethically nor economically adequate. By disregarding the principles of responsible marketing, stakeholder priorities, and a culture of social responsibility, Mylan's strategy falls short of meeting the standards expected of a sustainable and ethical business in the pharmaceutical industry. The complexity and sensitivity of healthcare require companies to navigate with a focus on both ethical considerations and sound economic practices, ensuring that life-saving treatments like the EpiPen remain accessible to all segments of society."},{"prompt":"Now write the whole IA again incorporating these paragraphs into what you had already written","completion":"The precipitous escalation in the price of EpiPens—a lifesaving necessity for those at the mercy of severe allergic reactions—has incited fervent public and academic discussions centered on the ethical and economic justifications of such an increase by Mylan Pharmaceuticals. With the EpiPen, Mylan leveraged a product that is of existential importance to sufferers into a vehicle for steep profit margins since its purchase from Merck in 2007, subsequently inflating the price by 400%. This action, and the manner in which Mylan conducted itself in its wake, underscores a departure from the ethos of virtue ethics—character traits that are imperative for corporate entities, particularly in the pharmaceutical realm where the stakes involve human life. The analysis of Mylan's pricing strategy for the EpiPen, through the frameworks provided by IB business and management concepts, will reveal a multifaceted approach to understanding the ethical and economic adequacies of Mylan's decisions. By interlacing stakeholder analysis, marketing planning, and corporate culture, this IA aims to dissect Mylan's approach and assess whether it aligns with the standards of responsible and sustainable corporate practice. In marketing planning, one must consider consumer needs and the associated marketing mix components, particularly product and price. By drastically raising the EpiPen's price, Mylan neglected essential marketing principles centered around product accessibility and customer satisfaction. In doing so, Mylan not only acted unethically but also miscalculated long-term business impacts, neglecting the potential backlash from inaccessible pricing that showed a myopic disregard for consumer demand elasticity and potential entry of competitors offering affordable alternatives. Pertaining to stakeholder analysis, IB business concepts dictate that corporations consider the interests of all affected parties. For Mylan, stakeholders not only included shareholders but patients dependent on EpiPens, healthcare providers, insurers, and government healthcare programs—all of whom were negatively impacted by the price increase. By prioritizing profit maximization, Mylan appeared to sideline stakeholder interests, an approach that has led to substantial reputational damage, trust erosion, and challenged longevity of customer relationships, as stakeholders felt Mylan exploited its position without due regard for public health. Moreover, corporate culture becomes a mirror reflecting the true nature of a company's operations and priorities. Mylan's culture, as inferred from its actions post-acquisition, highlighted a disparity between profit and integrity, between shareholder returns and patient access, which in virtue ethics are not mutually exclusive but rather delicately interdependent. A culture of transparency and social responsibility would have guided Mylan toward a pricing strategy that reflected both ethical and sustainable business practices, ensuring long-term viability in lieu of short-term gains. Integrating these principles from IB business and management, it is clear that Mylan's strategy for the EpiPen showcases significant drawbacks both ethically and economically. The price hike cannot be reconciled with virtuous business traits such as clear communication, cooperation, and receptive response to criticism. Mylan's strategy neglected cooperation with industry counterparts and government entities for the proliferation of affordable EpiPen alternatives. Despite offering discounts and free products to schools, these measures hardly offset the broader economic impact on lower-income patients and the healthcare system at large. In conclusion, this paper argues that Mylan's actions regarding the EpiPen pricing are ethically and economically inadequate. The lack of virtuous corporate conduct embodied in clear communication, cooperation, and openness to criticism, paired with a narrow focus on profit in lieu of patient welfare raises profound ethical questions. Economically, this strategy is unsustainable, undermining long-term stakeholder trust and inviting market correction mechanisms through alternate affordable products. The market forces are poignantly visible in recent FDA approvals of competing devices and pre-filled syringes, which not only challenge the economic adequacy of the EpiPen's price but are also forcing Mylan to realign its practices with the ethical and economic considerations befitting a socially responsible pharmaceutical giant. The case of Mylan is thus illustrative of the imperative need, now more than ever, for corporate strategy in healthcare to harmonize economic objectives with ethical imperatives."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It is volatile, meaning the data stored in primary storage is lost when the power is turned off. Primary storage is faster compared to secondary storage and is used to hold data and instructions that are actively being processed by the CPU. The two main types of primary storage are: 1. Random Access Memory (RAM): RAM is the most common type of primary storage. It is temporary memory that holds data that the CPU is currently working on. RAM allows for random access, meaning data can be read from or written to in any order, regardless of its physical location. When the system is powered off, the data in RAM is lost. 2. Cache Memory: Cache memory is a small but extremely fast type of primary storage. It is built into the CPU or located very close to it. Cache memory stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up the CPU's data retrieval process. It acts as a temporary storage between the CPU and RAM, reducing the time it takes to access data. Secondary Storage: Secondary storage, also known as external memory or auxiliary storage, is used for long-term data storage when the computer is powered off or restarted. Unlike primary storage, secondary storage is non-volatile, meaning data remains stored even when the power is turned off. Secondary storage devices are generally slower than primary storage but offer larger storage capacities. Common types of secondary storage include: 1. Hard Disk Drive (HDD): HDDs are the most common type of secondary storage. They use magnetic storage to store and retrieve data on rotating disks called platters. HDDs offer larger storage capacities, making them suitable for storing operating systems, applications, documents, and multimedia files. 2. Solid-State Drive (SSD): SSDs are becoming increasingly popular as secondary storage devices. They use memory chips to store data instead of rotating disks, resulting in faster read and write speeds compared to HDDs. SSDs are commonly used as system drives or for applications that require fast data access. 3. Optical Drives: Optical drives, like CD/DVD drives, use laser technology to read and write data on optical discs. They are often used for data backup, software installation, or media playback. 4. Flash Drives: Flash drives, also known as USB drives or thumb drives, use flash memory to store data. They are portable, reliable, and have no moving parts. Flash drives are commonly used for data transfer, backup, and as a portable storage solution. Secondary storage is essential for long-term data retention, backup, and archiving, as it provides a persistent storage medium that is not affected by power loss. However, accessing data from secondary storage is slower compared to primary storage due to physical limitations and technology used in these devices."},{"prompt":"how a request is processed in a computer (take an example of google voice search) state its output and input steps","completion":"When a request is processed in a computer, such as a Google Voice search, the following steps are involved: Input Steps: 1. Voice input: The user speaks a query into a device with a microphone, which captures the audio input. 2. Audio-to-text conversion: The voice input is converted into text using speech recognition technology. This involves analyzing the audio waveforms, identifying phonetic sounds, and mapping them to corresponding words. Processing Steps: 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): The converted text is processed using NLP algorithms to understand the meaning and intent of the query. NLP analyzes the syntactic and semantic structure of the text, performs entity recognition, and identifies relevant keywords. 4. Query formulation: Based on the processed text, a structured query is formulated, including extracting keywords, determining the context, and understanding the user's search intent. 5. Query matching: The formulated query is compared to an indexed database of web pages and information to find the most relevant results. This involves ranking algorithms that prioritize results based on relevance, authority, and other factors. Output Steps: 6.

As a few generations passed, however, a new hierarchy was formed. Superpowered society decided that in the bottom were those with one superpower, while on top were those with an extra superpower or two to make them immune to the main superpower's drawbacks. For example, two individuals can have pyrokinesis, but the upper class had extra powers that rendered them immune to their fires while those in the lower class had to suffer severe burns from their fire. Speedsters in the upper class had a variety of superpowers that made them immune to whiplash, friction and other drawbacks to super speed while those in the lower class suffered lacerated skin and even ear damage from sonic booms whenever they ran. Those in the upper class with the power to grow and shrink have extra powers to allow for movement despite their increased size and mass, while those stuck in the lower class suffered under the effects of the square-cube law or were crushed by their own gravity. This applied to every superpower and/or extra power under the sun that humans were either born lucky or unlucky enough to either benefit from or face harm from.","completion":"In a world where superpowers had become the norm, the societal structure was now dictated by the number of superpowers one possessed. As generations passed, the once chaotic world was now strictly divided into upper and lower classes based on these abilities. In the sprawling city of Veridion, home to millions of superpowered individuals, the disparities between the classes were stark. The upper class, the ExtraPowereds, led lives of luxury and privilege. They reveled in their additional abilities, basking in the safety and comfort it granted them. The lower class, the Afflicted, on the other hand, struggled daily with the drawbacks and limitations of their singular superpowers. Kaida Hastings, a young woman in her early twenties, belonged to the lower class. Her power was aerokinesis, the ability to manipulate and control air. While it seemed like a mighty ability to some, Kaida's wind manipulation came at a heavy price. With every gust she conjured, her lungs suffered, as though inhaling razor-sharp shards of glass. She had to bear this agonizing pain every time she used her power. Envious of those in the upper class who enjoyed their extra powers, Kaida yearned for a fairer society. She believed that every superpowered individual, regardless of their abilities, deserved equal treatment and opportunities. Her heart burned with an unyielding desire to challenge the existing hierarchy and create a society where all powers were valued equally. Kaida's chance to realize her vision came when a prestigious event called the Superpower Symposium was announced. It aimed to bring together ExtraPowereds and Afflicted individuals for a series of discussions and debates, with the hope of fostering understanding and cooperation between the classes. Determined to make a difference, Kaida decided to attend the symposium and confront the powers-that-be. With the help of her fellow Afflicted friends, she prepared a powerful speech to deliver on the grand stage. Their words were intended to inspire change, to challenge the unjust societal hierarchy that had plagued their lives for far too long. As Kaida took the podium before a sea of expectant eyes, she could feel the weight of generations of inequality pressing upon her. Her voice resonated through the room as she passionately argued for unity, equality, and the recognition and acceptance of every power, regardless of its limitations. Her speech captivated the audience, igniting a spark of revolt within their hearts. Afflicted individuals from all walks of life found solace in her words, realizing that they were not alone in their struggles. The symposium became a turning point, a catalyst for change. Soon, a movement emerged, challenging the established hierarchy and demanding equality. Protesters took to the streets, their voices echoing through the city as they fought for a new era. Under mounting pressure, the government was forced to reassess its policies. Reforms were proposed, and the voices of the Afflicted were finally being heard. Superpowers were no longer seen as a measure of worth, but rather as unique traits that made each individual special. Through passion, determination, and unwavering belief, Kaida and her fellow Afflicted not only dismantled the hierarchy but also reshaped the very essence of society. They ushered in an era of unity, where the potential of each power was explored and celebrated, rather than used as a tool for division. In this new age, the once-dominant upper class realized the worth in unity and empathy, now sharing their considerable powers with those who had once been oppressed. The city of Veridion became a symbol of hope, showcasing the extraordinary achievements that could be accomplished when people come together, united by a common goal. And Kaida Hastings stood at the forefront of this revolution, emerging as a beacon of change and inspiration, forever etching her name in the annals of history."},{"prompt":"Kaida Hastings would also be there when the new era would begin: The rise of real-life superheroes and supervillains. ExtraPowered and Afflicted alike could bask in the fame and glory of heroics or infamy and disdain of villainy. Whether heroes were acting outside the law or as legal government forces depended on what country in the world one was in. In one case, an ExtraPowered born with the power of flight and the extra powers needed to keep them immune to harm and the laws of physics during flight became a hero. In less savory news, an Afflicted would never bask in in newfound villainy as without any extra powers, his manipulation, control and creation of ice cut his life short due to hypothermia. Some heroes from the Afflicted made technological advances to counter the effects of having only one superpower. Some ExtraPowereds still saw themselves as above others for having the extra powers needed to keep them safe and became villains. In its own way, the fact that heroes and villains weren't directly tied to a class based on their birth and powers was somewhat good, a testament to the equality Kaida stood and fought for, but if the world wasn't ever going to be the same again, it sure won't be after the beginning of this new era.","completion":"As the era of real-life superheroes and supervillains dawned upon the world, Kaida Hastings found herself in the midst of a whirlwind of change and uncertainty. The once rigid class-based hierarchy had crumbled, replaced by a new dynamic where powers alone did not determine one's fate. In this new age, the lines between heroes and villains were blurred. Afflicted individuals, who had long suffered the consequences of their singular powers, now took charge of their own destiny. They utilized their unique abilities in ingenious ways, leveraging technology and knowledge to enhance their powers and level the playing field. One such Afflicted, Alex Stone, had the power to generate and manipulate ice. Instead of succumbing to a short life due to hypothermia, Alex used their scientific prowess to develop a specialized suit that regulated body temperature. This breakthrough allowed them to harness their icy abilities without endangering their own life. Meanwhile, some ExtraPowereds, with all their additional powers, succumbed to the allure of their superiority. Drunk on their perceived invincibility, they turned to a path of villainy, exploiting their extra powers to the detriment of society. The power dynamics shifted once again, this time not based on birth or class, but on individual choices and actions. The world was now a stage for epic battles between heroes and villains of all backgrounds. It became evident that being an ExtraPowered did not automatically equate to heroism, and being an Afflicted did not condemn one to villainy. The choices individuals made, the values they held, and the actions they took defined their path. Amidst the chaos, Kaida found herself torn. She had fought for equality, for a world where all powers were valued equally. Yet, she had not anticipated the rise of a new era filled with such complexity and moral ambiguity. She watched as heroes and villains emerged from all walks of life, their powers shaping their destinies but not determining their moral compass. As the world grappled with the consequences of this new era, Kaida realized that her fight was not yet over. She saw the need for a guiding light, someone who could bridge the divide and uphold the values of justice and compassion. Kaida dedicated herself to becoming a symbol of hope, a true hero in the midst of this turbulent world. She drew upon her aerokinesis, using her powers to protect the innocent, to bring stability in the face of chaos. She united Afflicted and ExtraPowered alike, rallying them around a shared purpose – to use their powers responsibly and for the betterment of society. In time, Kaida's unwavering resolve and her tireless efforts paved the way for a new understanding. Superheroes and supervillains were no longer solely defined by the number of their powers or the circumstances of their birth. They were defined by their choices, their actions, and the impact they had on the world around them. The world would never be the same again, that much was certain. But within the new era of superheroes and supervillains, a glimmer of hope emerged. A testament to the equality Kaida had fought for, where anyone, regardless of their powers, could rise above their limitations and make a difference. As Kaida soared through the skies, a beacon of strength and compassion, she knew that the world would continue to evolve. And in her heart, she held onto the belief that true heroes could rise from any corner of society, as long as they had the courage to stand up for what's right."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They typically address end-of-life care, including decisions related to euthanasia or assisted suicide. In the distinction between voluntary and nonvoluntary euthanasia, these advance directives play a role in ensuring that euthanasia procedures align with an individual's autonomous choices. Voluntary euthanasia occurs when a mentally competent individual, suffering from a terminal illness or unbearable pain, requests and consents to end their life. In such cases, advance directives like living wills can explicitly state an individual's desire for euthanasia if specific conditions are met. This document serves as evidence of the person's voluntary decision. On the other hand, nonvoluntary euthanasia involves ending the life of a person who is unable to express their desires or give informed consent, such as individuals in a coma or those with severe cognitive impairments. In this case, advance directives may appoint a durable power of attorney (also known as a healthcare proxy or surrogate) who is authorized to make decisions on behalf of the person. The proxy then becomes responsible for making end-of-life choices, including deciding whether or not to pursue euthanasia. However, it is crucial that the proxy acts in accordance with the individual's previously expressed wishes, ensuring that any decision aligns with their values and beliefs. In summary, advance directives like living wills and durable powers of attorney provide individuals with control over their healthcare decisions and help ensure that euthanasia procedures remain voluntary and within the bounds of an individual's expressed wishes."},{"prompt":"hat is the difference between ordinary and extraordinary measures of life support? If some measure of life support were common and inexpensive, would this necessarily make it an ordinary means of life support? Explain.","completion":"The difference between ordinary and extraordinary measures of life support lies in the level of invasiveness, complexity, or burden they impose on the patient and the healthcare system. Ordinary means of life support generally refer to medical interventions that are commonly used, relatively simple, and readily available. These measures are considered to be usual and expected when treating a certain medical condition. Examples include administering medication, providing basic nutrition and hydration, minor surgeries, or using conventional medical equipment. On the other hand, extraordinary means of life support encompass medical interventions that are more invasive, complex, or burdensome in nature. These measures often go beyond what is considered routine or standard care, and they may involve invasive surgeries, highly specialized treatments or technologies, or experimental procedures. Extraordinary measures can be physically and emotionally demanding, expensive, and may have uncertain outcomes. The mere fact that a measure of life support is common and inexpensive does not necessarily make it ordinary. The determination of whether a measure is ordinary or extraordinary depends on various factors, including the individual patient's condition, the expected benefit of the intervention, and the overall impact it has on the patient's well-being. For example, while a medication may be inexpensive and widely available, it may still be considered extraordinary if it poses significant risks or side effects for a particular patient. Similarly, a highly specialized and costly treatment may be deemed ordinary if it offers a substantial chance of recovery or significantly improves the patient's quality of life. Ultimately, the classification of a measure as ordinary or extraordinary is a complex ethical and medical decision. It depends on a careful assessment of the specific circumstances, weighing the benefits, burdens, risks, and potential outcomes of the intervention in relation to the patient's overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"is lasik ordinary or extraoirdinary?","completion":"Laser-Assisted in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) is a refractive surgical procedure used to correct vision problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. LASIK is typically considered an elective procedure and falls under the category of extraordinary means of treatment or support. While LASIK has become a relatively common and popular procedure, it is not a medically necessary intervention to sustain a person's life or treat life-threatening conditions. It is primarily performed to improve the patient's quality of life by enhancing vision. LASIK involves reshaping the cornea using a laser, which can carry certain risks and potential complications. Additionally, it requires specialized equipment and expertise, making it more complex and invasive than routine medical interventions. Therefore, despite its popularity and prevalence, LASIK would generally be considered an extraordinary means of treatment or support rather than an ordinary one."},{"prompt":"is it safe?","completion":"LASIK is generally considered a safe and effective procedure when performed by qualified and experienced surgeons. The vast majority of patients achieve improved vision and are satisfied with the results. However, like any surgical procedure, LASIK carries certain risks and potential complications. Some common side effects of LASIK include dry eyes, glare, halos, fluctuating vision, and discomfort during the healing process. These issues are usually temporary and can be managed with medication or additional treatments. Rarely, more serious complications can occur, such as infection, corneal flap complications, corneal ectasia (thinning and bulging of the cornea), or even vision loss. However, the occurrence of these severe complications is extremely rare. To minimize the risks, it is crucial to have a thorough evaluation by an experienced ophthalmologist or refractive surgeon before undergoing LASIK. They can assess your suitability for the procedure, discuss potential risks and benefits, and ensure that you have realistic expectations. It's important to note that individual factors, such as pre-existing eye conditions, overall health, and adherence to post-operative care instructions, can affect the safety and outcome of LASIK. Therefore, it is crucial to have a comprehensive discussion with your eye care professional to determine if LASIK is a safe and appropriate option for you based on your unique circumstances."},{"prompt":"你好","completion":"你好！有什么我可以帮助你的吗？"},{"prompt":"我想要一份关于中国未来环保行业发展趋势的报告","completion":"非常抱歉，我是一个语言模型AI助手，无法立即提供实时的报告。然而，我可以给你一些关于中国未来环保行业发展趋势的一般信息和观点。 中国是全球最大的二氧化碳排放国，但近年来政府采取了重要的环保措施，致力于减少环境污染和提高可持续发展。以下是一些在中国环保行业发展的趋势和重要领域： 1. 可再生能源：中国正大力发展可再生能源，包括太阳能和风能。政府鼓励采用更多的可再生能源来降低对化石燃料的依赖，减少污染和碳排放。 2. 清洁交通：中国政府致力于推进电动汽车的发展，并建设充电设施。鼓励市民使用电动车和公共交通，以减少汽车尾气排放。 3. 智能城市：智能城市的概念正在获得越来越多的关注。通过应用智能技术，中国城市可以更有效地管理资源和能源使用，以提高环境效率。 4. 废物管理和循环经济：中国正加大力度改进废物处理和管理方式，鼓励循环利用和资源再生。政府对废物分类、回收和处理的规定也越来越严格。 5. 环境监测和治理：中国政府加强了对环境污染的监测和治理，加大了对污染企业的处罚力度。同时，鼓励创新技术的应用，以解决环保问题。 这些趋势和领域代表了中国环保行业未来的发展方向。希望这些信息能给你提供一些参考。如需更详细的报告，建议你查找相关研究机构或咨询专业人士。"},{"prompt":"你觉得未来中国水环境治理行业发展方向如何","completion":"未来中国水环境治理行业的发展方向主要包括以下几点： 1. 水污染治理技术的创新：随着科技的不断进步，新兴的水污染治理技术将不断涌现。例如，膜技术、生物技术和化学氧化等，将提高水污染治理的效率和效果。 2. 智能水务系统的推广：通过应用物联网、大数据和人工智能等技术，智能水务系统可以实现水资源管理、供应链优化、异常检测和预测等功能，提高水资源利用效率和水污染治理水平。 3. 政策法规的完善：中国政府将加大对水环境治理的支持力度，推出一系列政策法规来规范和引导行业的发展。加强污水排放标准的监管、推动企业环境责任等，将进一步推动水环境治理行业的发展。 4. 城市雨水管理的综合治理：城市雨水管理是指采取一系列措施，包括雨水收集、蓄存、利用和排放，以减轻城市内涝问题和水体污染。未来将继续加大对城市雨水管理的投资和技术研发。 5. 生态修复和保护：生态修复和保护是改善水环境质量的重要手段。中国将加强湿地保护、河流生态修复等工作，促进生态系统的恢复和水环境的改善。 6. 水资源管理的优化：合理的水资源管理对于保障水环境的健康具有重要意义。未来将进一步完善水资源的划分和配置机制，鼓励节水措施的采用，提高水资源的利用效率。 以上是我对未来中国水环境治理行业发展方向的一些观点。当然，具体的发展方向还会受到技术进步、政策法规等多种因素的影响。相信随着时间的推移，中国水环境治理行业将不断取得新的突破和进展。"},{"prompt":"地表水体中COD如何进一步去除","completion":"COD（化学需氧量）是衡量水体中有机物含量的指标，高COD水体可能表示存在有机物污染。下面是一些常见的方法来进一步去除地表水体中的COD： 1. 生物处理：生物处理是一种常见的COD去除方法，利用微生物降解有机物。常见的方法包括活性污泥法、生物膜法和生物颗粒法等。这些方法利用微生物的代谢能力，将有机物转化为二氧化碳和水等无害物质。 2. 氧化处理：氧化是另一种有效去除COD的方法。常见的氧化剂包括臭氧、高级氧化技术（如紫外光/过氧化氢、臭氧/过氧化氢等）和氧化还原法（如高锰酸钾法等）。这些方法通过氧化有机物，将其转化为更易于去除的化合物。 3. 吸附剂处理：吸附剂是一种用于去除水中有机物的材料，常见的吸附剂包括活性炭、氧化铁、天然硅胶和分子筛等。它们具有高比表面积和吸附能力，可以将有机物从水中吸附到表面上。 4. 混凝处理：混凝是一种常见的水处理方法，通过添加混凝剂使水中的细小悬浮物和有机物凝聚成大颗粒，方便后续的固液分离或沉淀。常见的混凝剂包括聚合氯化铝、聚合硫酸铁和硅酸铝等。 5. 光氧催化：光氧催化是一种先进的COD去除技术，利用光催化剂、紫外光和氧气等，在光催化反应中将有机物氧化降解。光氧催化具有高度的选择性和高效的降解能力。 需要注意的是，不同的水体质量和COD含量，选择最合适的COD去除方法可能会有所不同。实际应用中，通常会综合考虑多种处理方法的组合使用，以达到最佳的COD去除效果。此外，使用这些处理方法时，也需要结合具体的工程规模、经济成本和可行性等因素进行评估和选择。"},{"prompt":"未来中国房价会怎么发展","completion":"对于未来中国房价的发展趋势，没有一个确切的预测。房价受到多种因素的影响，包括经济发展、城市化进程、政策调控、需求和供应等。以下是一些可能对中国房价发展产生影响的因素： 1. 经济发展：经济增长对房价有重要影响。如果中国经济保持稳定增长，可能会刺激购买力和需求，进而影响房价上涨。 2. 政策调控：中国政府一直在通过各种政策来控制房地产市场，包括限购、限贷、限售和房地产税等。未来政府的政策取向将对房价走势产生很大影响。 3. 城市化进程：城市化进程导致了城市人口增长和住房需求的增加。如果城市化继续推进，可能会对房价产生推动作用。 4. 资金流动：资金流动性对房地产市场也会有影响。如果资金流动性较高，可能会导致资金涌入房地产市场，推动房价上涨。 5. 供需关系：供需关系是房价变动的重要因素之一。供大于求可能会导致房价下跌，而需求大于供应可能会推动房价上涨。 需要注意的是，房地产市场受到多个因素的复杂影响，预测房价变动是困难的。政府的政策调控措施和市场的变化都可能对房价产生重要影响。因此，对于房价的发展需谨慎，建议多关注市场动态和政策变化，以及在做出相关决策前进行充分的研究和咨询。"},{"prompt":"企业博士后面试会提哪些问题？","completion":"企业博士后的面试问题将涉及多个方面，包括学术能力、研究经历、团队合作能力和未来发展计划等。具体问题可能因企业和研究领域而异，但以下是一些常见的问题示例： 1. 研究背景和兴趣： - 你的研究领域是什么？为什么对此感兴趣？ - 你的博士论文的主要研究内容是什么？有哪些重要发现或成果？ 2. 研究经验和方法： - 你在博士期间进行的研究项目有哪些？可以分享一下具体的研究工作和方法吗？ - 你的研究中遇到的主要挑战是什么？你是如何解决的？ 3. 职业发展计划和目标： - 你为什么选择申请这个企业的博士后职位？ - 在未来的职业发展中，你的目标是什么？如何看待企业博士后对于你的职业发展的重要性？ 4. 团队合作和沟通能力： - 你是否有在团队合作中的经验？可以分享一些例子吗？ - 在博士期间，你是否导师的项目负责人或团队的一员？你是如何与他人合作的？ 5. 问题解决能力和创新思维： - 你在研究中是否遇到过困难或障碍？你是如何解决的？ - 你是否有创新的研究想法或提出过新方法？ 6. 企业相关问题： - 你对我们公司的研究方向和项目有了解吗？ - 你认为你的研究如何能为我们公司的目标和需求做出贡献？ 7. 其他问题： - 你对未来科研的趋势和展望有什么看法？ - 你如何平衡工作与个人生活之间的关系？ 面试过程中还可能进行自我介绍、提问环节等。为了准备面试，建议你充分复习自己的研究项目和论文，思考如何展示自己的能力和潜力。同时，也可以对目标公司或研究领域进行相关调研，了解企业的需求和发展方向，以便更好地回答问题。"},{"prompt":"假如你是导游，我们一行6个人要从合肥去云南玩7天，预算1万元，请帮我做一份行程攻略，请注意，我不喜欢行程太紧张，不喜欢网红景点，更喜欢有文化底蕴的景点，推荐时请附上各景点价格。","completion":"根据您的要求，我为您设计了一份7天在云南的文化底蕴行程攻略，预算在1万元以内。以下是行程的安排： Day 1: 合肥 - 昆明 - 抵达昆明后，入住酒店休息，可以在附近的小吃街尝试当地美食。 Day 2: 昆明 - 大理 - 上午前往大理，参观大理古城，了解白族文化。 - 下午乘船游览洱海，欣赏湖光山色。 - 晚上在古城内品尝白族特色美食。 Day 3: 大理 - 丽江 - 上午前往丽江，游览古城并了解纳西族文化。 - 下午参观束河古镇，欣赏古镇风光。 - 晚上可以在丽江古城尝试当地特色小吃。 Day 4: 丽江 - 束河 - 上午前往束河，游览古镇风情。 - 下午参观玉龙雪山，欣赏雪山美景，观看印象丽江的演出。 - 晚上返回丽江休息。 Day 5: 丽江 - 香格里拉 - 早上前往香格里拉，途中参观虎跳峡，欣赏壮丽的自然景观。 - 下午参观香格里拉古城，感受藏族文化。 - 晚上在香格里拉品尝藏式美食。 Day 6: 香格里拉 - 昆明 - 早上前往昆明，参观滇池，欣赏湖光山色。 - 下午可以选择参观昆明石林，探索奇特的石灰岩地貌。 - 晚上可以"},{"prompt":"how to test whether variables are correlated in spss","completion":"To test whether variables are correlated in SPSS, you can perform a correlation analysis.

Now, we calculate the standard error of the difference between the two means: [ SE = sqrt{frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} ] [ SE = sqrt{frac{2^2}{54} + frac{4^2}{71}} ] [ SE = sqrt{frac{4}{54} + frac{16}{71}} ] [ SE = sqrt{0.07407 + 0.22535} ] [ SE = sqrt{0.29942} ] [ SE approx 0.5472 ] (rounded to four decimal places) Let's now calculate the confidence interval: The margin of error (ME) is: [ ME = z times SE ] [ ME = 1.75 times 0.5472 ] [ ME approx 0.9576 ] (rounded to four decimal places) Now, plug in the values to get the interval: [ CI: (bar{x}_1 - bar{x}_2) pm ME ] [ CI: (23 - 21) pm 0.9576 ] [ CI: 2 pm 0.9576 ] The lower bound is: [ 2 - 0.9576 = 1.0424 ] The upper bound is: [ 2 + 0.9576 = 2.9576 ] Round to the nearest hundredth: [ CI: 1.04 < mu_1 - mu_2 < 2.96 ] Therefore, the 92% confidence interval for the difference in population means is estimated to be from 1.04 to 2.96."},{"prompt":"You are conducting a Goodness of Fit Chi-Squared hypothesis test ( = 0.05) for the claim that all 5 categories are equally likely to be selected.

There is not sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that all 5 categories are equally likely to be selected.","completion":"To conduct a Goodness of Fit Chi-Squared hypothesis test, we first need to calculate the expected frequency for each category under the assumption that all categories are equally likely to be selected. We then compare the observed frequencies to the expected frequencies using the Chi-Squared statistic. The null hypothesis for this test is that all categories are equally likely, and the alternative hypothesis is that they are not equally likely. A significance level (( alpha )) of 0.05 will be used. Let's calculate the expected frequency for each category. To do this, we sum the observed frequencies and then divide by the number of categories (since they are assumed to be equally likely). Sum of observed frequencies: ( 25 + 25 + 11 + 10 + 16 = 87 ) Expected frequency for each category: ( text{Expected Frequency (E)} = frac{87}{5} = 17.4 ) With the expected frequency calculated, we can fill in the table: [ begin{array}{ccc} text{Category} & text{Observed Frequency (O)} & text{Expected Frequency (E)} & text{((O-E)}^2/text{E)} A & 25 & 17.4 & ((25-17.4)^2/17.4) B & 25 & 17.4 & ((25-17.4)^2/17.4) C & 11 & 17.4 & ((11-17.4)^2/17.4) D & 10 & 17.4 & ((10-17.4)^2/17.4) E & 16 & 17.4 & ((16-17.4)^2/17.4) end{array} ] Now let's calculate ( ((O-E)^2/E) ) for each category. Remember, these values should use exact calculations without rounding: For A: ( ((O-E)^2/E) = ((25-17.4)^2/17.4) = (7.6^2/17.4) approx 3.3069 ) For B: ( ((O-E)^2/E) = ((25-17.4)^2/17.4) approx 3.3069 ) For C: ( ((O-E)^2/E) = ((11-17.4)^2/17.4) = (6.4^2/17.4) approx 2.3563 ) For D: ( ((O-E)^2/E) = ((10-17.4)^2/17.4) = (7.4^2/17.4) approx 3.1684 ) For E: ( ((O-E)^2/E) = ((16-17.4)^2/17.4) = (1.4^2/17.4) approx 0.1132 ) Now we sum these to get the Chi-squared test-statistic: Chi-squared test-statistic: ( chi^2 = 3.3069 + 3.3069 + 2.3563 + 3.1684 + 0.1132 approx 12.2517 ) Round the test-statistic to 3 decimal places: ( chi^2 approx 12.252 ) Degrees of freedom (d.f.) for the Chi-squared test is calculated as: ( text{d.f.} = text{number of categories} - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4 ) To find the P-value, we would use a Chi-squared distribution table or software with the Chi-squared statistic 12.252 and 4 degrees of freedom. After finding the P-value from the Chi-squared distribution for 4 degrees of freedom (which is not provided here), you would compare it to the significance level (( alpha )) of 0.05. If the P-value ≤ ( alpha ), reject the null hypothesis. If the P-value > ( alpha ), do not reject the null hypothesis. Without the exact P-value from the Chi-squared distribution, the last part cannot be completed with certainty. Given the calculated ( chi^2 ) value of 12.252 and 4 degrees of freedom, you could use statistical software or a Chi-squared distribution calculator to determine the P-value. If this calculated P-value is indeed less than ( alpha = 0.05 ), based on typical Chi-squared tables or calculators, the null hypothesis would be rejected. This would lead to the conclusion that there is sufficient evidence to warrant rejection of the claim that all 5 categories are equally likely to be selected."},{"prompt":"人民警察职业道德与职业技能","completion":"人民警察的职业道德和职业技能是他们在履行警察职责、保护人民安全的过程中所必须具备的素质和能力。 职业道德方面，人民警察应当具备以下基本要求： 1. 遵守法律和职业道德准则：人民警察应当遵守国家法律法规和警察职业道德准则，始终站在法律的一边，为人民服务，保护人民利益。 2.
