Now, we can calculate the width of the box by dividing the total number of cubes by the number of cubes that fit in the length and depth: Total number of cubes = 84 Number of cubes in length = 49 inches / 7 inches per cube = 7 cubes Number of cubes in depth = 14 inches / 7 inches per cube = 2 cubes Number of cubes in width = Total number of cubes / (Number of cubes in length × Number of cubes in depth) Number of cubes in width = 84 / (7 × 2) Number of cubes in width = 84 / 14 Number of cubes in width = 6 Now that we know there are 6 cubes fitting across the width, we can find the width of the box: Width of the box = Number of cubes in width × Side length of cube Width of the box = 6 cubes × 7 inches per cube Width of the box = 42 inches Therefore, the width of the box is boxed{42} inches."},{"prompt":"For any natural number ( k ): If ( k ) is even, divide it by 2.

This result follows if we can prove that point (M) lies on the line (PQ). 1. First, since (OP) is the diameter of (W_1), point (A) lies on the circle (W_1). Hence, by the definition of a diameter, (angle OAP=90^circ). Therefore, segment (PA) is tangent to the semicircle at point (A). 2.

We start by noting that 503 is a prime number. For any integer ( n ) ranging from 0 to 502, the fraction (frac{305n}{503}) is not an integer. This is because the numerator (305n) can't divide (503) evenly (since 503 is a prime number and does not share any factors with 305). To understand the behavior of (leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor), we observe that: frac{305n}{503} + frac{305(503-n)}{503} = 305. This equation implies that the sum of the fractional parts of ( frac{305n}{503} ) and ( frac{305(503-n)}{503} ) is precisely 1. The only integers in this sum are the floor parts, so: leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{305(503-n)}{503} rightrfloor = 304. Next, we consider the sum: sum_{n=0}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor. We note that taking the sum from ( n = 0 ) to ( 502 ) covers all the pairings: left( leftlfloor frac{305 times 0}{503} rightrfloor, leftlfloor frac{305 times 503}{503} rightrfloor right), left( leftlfloor frac{305 times 1}{503} rightrfloor, leftlfloor frac{305 times 502}{503} rightrfloor right), ldots, left( leftlfloor frac{305 times 251}{503} rightrfloor, leftlfloor frac{305 times 252}{503} rightrfloor right). These pairs show symmetrical contributions. We can write: sum_{n=0}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{305 times 0}{503} rightrfloor + sum_{n=1}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor. Since ( leftlfloor frac{305 times 0}{503} rightrfloor = 0 ), this reduces to: sum_{n=0}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor = sum_{n=1}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor. Next, we can pair the terms from 1 to 251 as follows: sum_{n=1}^{502} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor = sum_{n=1}^{251} left( leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{305(503-n)}{503} rightrfloor right). From above, we know each pair adds up to 304: sum_{n=1}^{251} leftlfloor frac{305n}{503} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{305(503-n)}{503} rightrfloor = 304 cdot 251.

Define the mapping: [ f(x) = frac{x + tan beta}{1 - tan beta cdot x} ] Let ( x = tan y ).

Select ( beta ) such that ( tan (pi/5) ): 4. This ensures that ( tan y = tan(y + 5beta) ).

Assuming this speed is in kilometers per hour (km/h), we need to convert it to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the distance. Speed in m/s = Speed in km/h × (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 60 × (1000 / 1) × (1 / 3600) Speed in m/s = 60 × 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 60000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 16.67 (rounded to two decimal places) Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to completely cross the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 400 meters / 16.67 m/s Time ≈ 24 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{24} seconds for the train to completely cross the bridge."},{"prompt":"As the Kubiks head homeward, away from the beach in the family van, Jerry decides to take a different route away from the beach than the one they took to get there.

Compute lfloor drfloor .","completion":"1. Let ( a ) be the number of units north and ( b ) be the number of units west. Given that the total distance driven is 500 miles and there are exactly 300 right turns, we need to maximize the distance from the starting point, which is given by ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). 2. Since each right turn changes the direction, we can assume that ( a + b = 500 ) because any deviation from this would mean either ( a ) or ( b ) is smaller than it needs to be, reducing ( a^2 + b^2 ). 3. We need to maximize ( sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ). To do this, we first maximize ( a^2 + b^2 ). Using the identity: [ a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab ] and substituting ( a + b = 500 ), we get: [ a^2 + b^2 = 500^2 - 2ab = 250000 - 2ab ] 4. To maximize ( a^2 + b^2 ), we need to minimize ( ab ). Given the constraints ( a, b geq 150 ), we can find the minimum value of ( ab ). 5. Since ( a + b = 500 ), we can express ( b ) in terms of ( a ): [ b = 500 - a ] Thus, the product ( ab ) becomes: [ ab = a(500 - a) = 500a - a^2 ] 6. To find the minimum value of ( ab ), we take the derivative of ( 500a - a^2 ) with respect to ( a ) and set it to zero: [ frac{d}{da}(500a - a^2) = 500 - 2a = 0 ] Solving for ( a ), we get: [ 2a = 500 implies a = 250 ] Thus, ( b = 500 - 250 = 250 ). 7. However, we need to check the boundary values ( a = 150 ) and ( a = 350 ) because ( a ) and ( b ) must be at least 150: [ ab = 150 times 350 = 52500 ] 8. Substituting ( a = 150 ) and ( b = 350 ) into ( a^2 + b^2 ): [ a^2 + b^2 = 150^2 + 350^2 = 22500 + 122500 = 145000 ] 9. Therefore, the maximum distance ( d ) is: [ d = sqrt{145000} ] 10.

Using alpha = 10^circ and beta = 30^circ, we get: sin(10^circ + 30^circ) = sin 10^circ cos 30^circ + cos 10^circ sin 30^circ.

The deficit at a vertex is given by (2pi) minus the sum of the face angles at that vertex. 2. **Calculating total curvature for a cube:** For example, a cube has an angle deficit that can be calculated by considering the angles at each vertex: - Each vertex of a cube has three right angles meeting, each contributing (frac{pi}{2}). - The sum of the face angles at each vertex is (3 times frac{pi}{2} = frac{3pi}{2}). - The deficit at each vertex is (2pi - frac{3pi}{2} = frac{pi}{2}). - Since a cube has 8 vertices, the total angle deficit is (8 times frac{pi}{2} = 4pi). 3. **Analyzing the polyhedron specified in the problem:** The polyhedron considered here is a \\"rectangular pyramid\\" with four triangular faces and one square face.

If at least two vertices of the square are inside the triangle, as shown in Figure 1, then upon expanding the square, one vertex will be on the boundary of the triangle. Repeating this process, the vertices of the square will eventually be on the triangle's boundary, maximizing the square’s area. 3. **Illustrative Example**: In Figure 2, a square with three of its vertices touching the sides of a triangle, is shown. Label the points such that XY parallel BC, and assume PB leq PY and CR geq RX. Here, let PS (the side of the square) intersect BC at point D and AC at point E. Due to the assumption PB leq PY, the area of triangle PBD is not larger than the area of triangle PSY. Hence, the area of triangle CDE is smaller than that of triangle ABC. 4. **Scaling Argument**: By scaling the triangle CDE along with the square to ensure its area becomes one unit, the area of the square PQRS will increase correspondingly. This implies the largest inscribed square touches the boundary of the triangle with one of its sides. 5. **Optimal Triangle**: From the equality x: d = (x + d): BC, derived from the similarity of triangle ASR and triangle ABC, we get BC = frac{d(x+d)}{x}. Consequently, the area of the triangle becomes frac{1}{2} times frac{d}{x} times (x+d)^2. By applying the arithmetic and geometric means inequality, we estimate: [ frac{1}{2} times frac{d}{x} times (d+x)^2 geq frac{1}{2} times frac{d}{x} times (2sqrt{dx})^2 = 2d^2 ] 6. **Maximizing Area**: The term 2d^2 reaches its maximum when it matches the area of the triangle, which happens if x = d. Thus, d^2 = frac{1}{2}, giving BC = x + d = sqrt{2}. Therefore, the largest area square that can fit into the triangle is within a sqrt{2} base and sqrt{2} height non-obtuse triangle of unit area. # Conclusion: The triangle having a sqrt{2} base and sqrt{2} height, forming a unit triangle without any obtuse angles, can cover the largest possible square area. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Elizabeth wants to buy a pencil that costs 6 dollars.

Consequently, ( R ) is a fixed point. Note that ( PR < PF ) since ( P ) lies inside ( k_1 ), implying ( R ) is an interior point of the segment ( PF ). Thus, ( R ) is an internal point of both ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ). 3. **Behaviour of Points:** Points ( P ) and ( Q ) remain consistent since ( P ) lies within ( AB ) and most specifically on ( k_1 ). 4. **Dividing the Circumcircle into Arcs:** The circumcircle ( k_3 ) is divided into three arcs by points ( A, B, ) and ( Q ). Points ( C ) and ( D ) lie on the arcs ( Q A ) and ( Q B ) respectively given ( A ) and ( B ) are inside ( k_2 ) while ( Q ) is outside.

Hence, any two distinct lines cannot have more than one common point. 2. **Theorem 2:** Two distinct planes either have no common points or intersect in a line, and only in that line. **Proof:** - Let's consider two distinct planes, ( P ) and ( Q ). - If they have a point ( A ) in common, then they must intersect. - Draw two distinct points ( B ) and ( C ) in the intersection of ( P ) and ( Q ). By definition of plane intersection, ( B ) and ( C ) form a line ( l ) that lies in both planes. - Any further point common to ( P ) and ( Q ) must lie on this line ( l ), since through any point in the intersection of two planes, a unique line is determined.

Let a and b represent the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse, respectively, and let c be the distance from the center of the ellipse to a focus. By definition, the eccentricity e is the ratio c/a. For an equilateral triangle with side length b, we have the following relationships due to a vertex and the foci forming this triangle: 1.

The total runs scored after 17 matches is now 16A + 87. The new average (A + 3) is calculated by dividing the total runs by the number of matches (17), so we have: New Average (A + 3) = (Total Runs after 17 matches) / 17 A + 3 = (16A + 87) / 17 Now, we multiply both sides by 17 to get rid of the fraction: 17(A + 3) = 16A + 87 17A + 51 = 16A + 87 Next, we subtract 16A from both sides to isolate A on one side: 17A - 16A + 51 = 87 A + 51 = 87 Now, we subtract 51 from both sides to solve for A: A = 87 - 51 A = 36 So, the average score of the batsman before the 17th match was 36.

To convert km/h to m/s, we multiply by (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) and divide by (3600 seconds / 1 hour): Speed of Train 1 in m/s = 120 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 h) = 120 * 1000 / 3600 = 33.33 m/s (approximately) Speed of Train 2 in m/s = 95 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 h) = 95 * 1000 / 3600 = 26.39 m/s (approximately) Since the trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds: Relative speed = Speed of Train 1 + Speed of Train 2 Relative speed = 33.33 m/s + 26.39 m/s Relative speed = 59.72 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to be completely clear of each other: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 510 meters / 59.72 m/s Time ≈ 8.54 seconds So, it will take approximately boxed{8.54} seconds for the two trains to be completely clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"prompt":"Let T = 1 2 + 3 4 + cdots + 2021 2022.

Hence, for one group, the number of matches is binom{4}{2} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6 matches. Since there are two groups, we have 6 times 2 = 12 matches in the round-robin stage. 2.

A line through P intersects odot O_2 again at C. Line AP and BC intersect at R. We need to prove that the circumcircle of triangle PQR is tangent to both lines BP and BR. Here is a detailed step-by-step proof: 1. **Extend CP to meet AB at D, and connect AQ, PQ, RQ.** 2. We start by showing that quadrilateral ABRQ is cyclic. [ angle QAR = angle QAP ] This holds because R, Q lie on a straight line through A. 3. By the property of cyclic quadrilateral, the angles subtended by the same segment are equal: [ angle QAP = angle QPC ] Since PQ is common chord: [ angle QPC = angle QBC ] 4. From steps 2 and 3, we have: [ angle QAR = angle QBC ] Therefore, A, B, R, Q are concyclic. 5. Since quadrilateral ABRQ is cyclic, we have: [ angle BAR = angle BQR ] 6. Next, we show another cyclic property dealing with angles subtended by equal arcs: [ angle ABP = angle BQP ] 7. Therefore, considering angles in cyclic properties: [ angle BPR = angle BAR + angle ABP = angle BQR + angle BQP = angle PQR ] 8. This implies: [ BP text{ is tangent to the circumcircle of } triangle PQR. ] 9. Now we show that lines BR and BP are tangent to triangle PQR. We need: [ angle BRP = angle PQR ] 10. By angle chasing in cyclic quadrilateral BPCQ: [ angle BCP = angle PBA ] Thus: [ angle CRP = angle PAR ] Also: [ angle PAR = angle RQP ] 11. Combining the angles, we have: [ angle BRP = angle BCP + angle CPR ] Simplifying: [ angle BRP = angle PBA + angle PAD = angle PRB ] Therefore: [ BR text{ is tangent to the circumcircle of } triangle PQR ] Thus combining all the results, we conclude that the circumcircle of triangle PQR is tangent to both lines BP and BR.

The equation of the directrix for this simpler parabola can then be adjusted to find the directrix of the given parabola. 1. **Identify the parabola's symmetry and focus**: The parabola y = 8x^2 is symmetric about the y-axis, suggesting the focus is at (0,f) for some value f. Let the equation of the directrix be y = d. 2. **Equation for a point on the parabola**: Consider a point (x, 8x^2) on the parabola y = 8x^2. 3. **Distance formulas**: The distance squared from this point to the focus is PF^2 = x^2 + (8x^2 - f)^2, and the distance squared to the directrix is PQ^2 = (8x^2 - d)^2. 4. **Equating distances**: Since points on the parabola are equidistant from the focus and directrix, we have [x^2 + (8x^2 - f)^2 = (8x^2 - d)^2.] 5. **Expanding and matching coefficients**: Expanding both sides gives [x^2 + 64x^4 - 16fx^2 + f^2 = 64x^4 - 16dx^2 + d^2.] Matching coefficients, we find begin{align*} 1 - 16f &= -16d, f^2 &= d^2. end{align*} 6. **Solving for d and f**: From 1 - 16f = -16d, we deduce f - d = frac{1}{16}.

Substituting f = -d into f - d = frac{1}{16} gives -2d = frac{1}{16}, leading to d = -frac{1}{32}. 7. **Adjusting for the shift**: The directrix of y = 8x^2 is y = -frac{1}{32}. Since the given parabola y = 8x^2 + 2 is shifted upward by 2 units, the equation of its directrix is y = -frac{1}{32} + 2 = frac{63}{32}.

This is because the length of the spring changes in response to the weight of the object. Therefore, statement A accurately reflects the relationship between x and y. **Statement B**: According to the given data, for every increase of 1 kg in weight (x), the length of the spring (y) increases by 0.5 cm. Starting from 0 kg and 8 cm, when the weight is 6 kg, the length of the spring can be calculated as follows: [y = 8 + 6 times 0.5 = 8 + 3 = 11 cm] This calculation shows that statement B is accurate based on the given relationship. **Statement C**: The given data explicitly shows that for every increase of 1 kg in weight, the spring length increases by 0.5 cm.

However, the key here is that the convex hull of points involving regularly spaced vertices in multiple polygons will simplify to a convex shape with fewer vertices scalable by the overall arrangement, rather than the individual polygons. 5. **Using Euler's Theorem (Graph Theory):** - Euler's theorem for planar graphs states ( V - E + F = 2 ), where ( V ) is the number of vertices, ( E ) is the number of edges, and ( F ) is the number of faces. - For our setup, we simplify to just count vertex-wise minimal setup. 6. **Argument on Maximum Number of Vertices:** Even if we assume that all 1000 100-gons are pointy vertices for convex enclosure, realistically the arrangement of such polygons confines to not all defining the boundary. Each vertex doesn't necessitate part of the convex hull's bounds without redundancy for its specific angular offering.

Let's first consider the first pair of numbers. Let a and b be positive integers. Ondra was supposed to calculate (-a) cdot (-b), but he calculated -a - b. We know that: [ -a - b = -a cdot b ] which is equivalent to the equation: [ a + b = a cdot b ] Since a and b are positive integers, we need to find pairs (a, b) such that the equation holds. This results in: [ a + b = ab ] 2. To solve for a and b, let's rewrite ab - a - b = 0: [ ab - a - b + 1 = 1 ] which can be factored as: [ (a-1)(b-1) = 1 ] The only pair of positive integers that satisfy this equation is a-1 = 1 and b-1 = 1, leading to: [ a = 2, quad b = 2 ] Therefore, the only solution is a = 2 and b = 2. 3. Now, let's analyze the second pair of numbers. The given condition is: [ ab = (-182) cdot frac{1}{-a - b} ] which simplifies to: [ ab = 182 cdot frac{1}{a+b} ] or equivalently: [ ab(a + b) = 182 ] To solve this, we consider the prime factorization of 182, which is: [ 182 = 2 times 7 times 13 ] 4. Since a and b are integers and considering the symmetry of a and b (i.e., we can assume a leq b for simplification), let's systematically evaluate all possible factor pairs of 182: - When a = 1 and b = 182: a + b = 183, does not satisfy ab(a+b) = 182. - When a = 2 and b = 91: a + b = 93, does not satisfy ab(a+b) = 182. - When a = 7 and b = 26: a + b = 33, does not satisfy ab(a+b) = 182. - When a = 13 and b = 14: a + b = 27, does not satisfy ab(a+b) = 182. - When a = 1 and b = 13: a + b = 14 does satisfy ab(a + b) = 182: [ ab(a + b) = 1 cdot 13 cdot 14 = 182 ] Hence, a = 1 and b = 13 is a solution. 5. By symmetry, Ondra could have been given either (-1) cdot (-13) or (-13) cdot (-1). Conclusion: - Ondra received two multiplication problems as follows: [ (-2) cdot (-2) ] [ (-1) cdot (-13) quad text{or} quad (-13) cdot (-1) ] Thus, the two examples are: [ boxed{(-2) cdot (-2) quad text{and} quad (-1) cdot (-13) quad text{or} quad (-13) cdot (-1)} ]"},{"prompt":"f is a differentiable function such that f(f(x))=x where x in [0,1] .Also f(0)=1 .Find the value of int_0^1(xf(x))^{2016}dx","completion":"1. Given that ( f ) is a differentiable function such that ( f(f(x)) = x ) for ( x in [0,1] ) and ( f(0) = 1 ). We need to find the value of the integral: [ int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx ] 2. Since ( f(f(x)) = x ), ( f ) is an involution, meaning ( f ) is its own inverse. This implies that ( f ) is a bijection on ([0,1]). 3. Let us consider the substitution ( t = f(x) ). Then, ( x = f(t) ) and differentiating both sides with respect to ( t ), we get: [ dx = f'(t) , dt ] 4. Using the substitution ( t = f(x) ), the integral becomes: [ I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx = int_0^1 (f(t) - t)^{2016} f'(t) , dt ] 5. Notice that ( f ) being an involution implies ( f(f(x)) = x ). Therefore, we can write: [ I = int_0^1 (f(x) - x)^{2016} , dx ] 6. Now, consider the integral: [ I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx ] and [ J = int_0^1 (f(x) - x)^{2016} , dx ] 7. Since ( f ) is a bijection, we can change the variable in ( J ) by setting ( u = f(x) ). Then ( du = f'(x) , dx ) and the limits of integration remain the same because ( f ) maps ([0,1]) onto itself. Thus: [ J = int_0^1 (f(f(x)) - f(x))^{2016} f'(x) , dx = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} f'(x) , dx ] 8. Since ( f ) is differentiable and ( f(f(x)) = x ), we have: [ f'(f(x)) f'(x) = 1 ] This implies that ( f'(x) ) is positive and ( f'(x) = frac{1}{f'(f(x))} ). 9. Therefore, we can write: [ J = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} frac{1}{f'(f(x))} , dx ] 10. Combining the integrals ( I ) and ( J ), we get: [ I + J = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx + int_0^1 (f(x) - x)^{2016} , dx ] 11. Since ( (x - f(x))^{2016} = (f(x) - x)^{2016} ), we have: [ I + I = 2I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx ] 12. Therefore, we conclude that: [ 2I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx ] 13. Solving for ( I ), we get: [ I = frac{1}{2} int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx ] 14. Since ( I = int_0^1 (x - f(x))^{2016} , dx ), we have: [ I = frac{1}{2} I ] 15.

Notice that ( d_{s+1-i} = frac{N}{d_i} ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, s ). 2. Calculate ( d_{i+1} - d_i ). This difference is divisible by ( gcd(d_i, d_i+1) ), so ( gcd(d_i, d_{i+1}) leq d_{i+1} - d_i ). 3. Let ( r_i = (d_{i+1} - d_i) - gcd(d_i, d_{i+1}) geq 0 ). 4.

Also, from the given condition: [ gcd(d_1, d_2) + gcd(d_2, d_3) + ldots + gcd(d_{s-1}, d_s) = N - 2 ] 6.

So, for some ( k ): [ 1 = (d_{k+1} - d_k) - gcd(d_k, d_{k+1}) ] Since both sides must be divisible by ( gcd(d_k, d_{k+1}) ), we have: [ gcd(d_k, d_{k+1}) = 1 ] and: [ d_{k+1} - d_k = 2 ] 8. Both ( d_k ) and ( d_{k+1} ) must be odd since they differ by 2 and ( gcd(d_k, d_{k+1}) = 1 ). 9.

Thus, ( r_m > 0 ) is possible if and only if ( k = m ) and ( s = 2k ). 12. This implies ( d_{k+1} = frac{N}{d_k} ), and since ( N = d_k d_{k+1} ), we conclude ( N ) is odd. 13.

The center of this circle is the incenter ( I ). - From ( I ), drop perpendiculars to the sides of the triangle. Let's denote the points where these perpendiculars meet the sides as ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ), corresponding to sides ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ), respectively. - This process divides the triangle into three quadrilaterals: ( AIDF ), ( BIDE ), and ( CIEF ). 4. **Verification that each is circumscriptible and exscriptible**: - By construction, ( AIDF ), ( BIDE ), and ( CIEF ) each touch the incircle, thus they have an inscribed circle. - Since the sum of the angles around point ( I ) is ( 360^circ ) and the perpendiculars from ( I ) ensure right angles at ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ), the opposite angles sums condition for being circumscriptible holds automatically. 5. **Generalizing to 2019 quadrilaterals**: - We have shown that a triangle can be divided into 3 quadrilaterals that satisfy the properties. - To divide the triangle into 2019 such quadrilaterals, we can iteratively apply the same principle. - First, determine the number of triangles needed: [ frac{2019}{3} = 673 ] Hence, the triangle ( triangle ABC ) needs to be divided into 673 smaller triangles. 6. **Dividing the triangle into smaller triangles**: - Divide ( triangle ABC ) into 673 triangles. This can be done, for example, by drawing line segments from one vertex to appropriately defined points on the opposite sides. 7. **Final Step**: - Each of these 673 smaller triangles can be divided into 3 circumscriptible and exscriptible quadrilaterals using the method described above. 8. **Conclusion**: - Thus, the original triangle ( triangle ABC ) can be divided into ( 673 times 3 = 2019 ) quadrilaterals, each circumscribed and inscribed as required.

Yahya wants to go from his house to the Pinedale mall, which is 5 stops away. The mall is 25 kilometers away from Yahya's house. What is the average speed of the Pinedale bus line?","completion":"To find the average speed of the Pinedale bus line, we need to know the total distance and the total time it takes for the bus to travel that distance. We know that the mall is 25 kilometers away from Yahya's house and that there are 5 stops in between. Since the bus stops every 5 minutes, for 5 stops, the total stopping time will be 5 stops * 5 minutes/stop = 25 minutes. However, we need to consider that the time between the first stop (Yahya's house) and the second stop is not included in these 25 minutes, as well as the time from the last stop to the mall. Since there are 5 stops, there are actually 6 intervals of travel (from Yahya's house to the first stop, then between each of the 4 subsequent stops, and finally from the last stop to the mall). Therefore, the total travel time will be 25 minutes (for the stops) plus 5 minutes for each of the 6 intervals, which is an additional 30 minutes. So, the total travel time is 25 minutes + 30 minutes = 55 minutes. To find the average speed, we use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours since speed is typically measured in kilometers per hour (km/h). There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 55 minutes is 55/60 hours. Speed = 25 km / (55/60 hours) Speed = 25 km / (11/12 hours) Speed = 25 km * (12/11 hours) Speed = 300/11 km/h Speed ≈ 27.27 km/h Therefore, the average speed of the Pinedale bus line is approximately boxed{27.27} km/h."},{"prompt":"The students in Mr. Smith's literature class are assigned to read a 900page book.

Any prime ( p > 3 ) must satisfy ( p equiv pm 1 pmod{6} ). 3. Since ( x_4 - x_1 = 8 equiv 2 pmod{6} ), the only possible case is ( x_4 equiv 1 pmod{6} ) and ( x_1 equiv -1 pmod{6} ).

Thus, ( p_1 - q_1 equiv 0 pmod{6} ), which means ( 6 mid (p_1 - q_1) ). 5. Now consider the set ( S = {x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4} ).

This means that the retail price of the video recorder is 200 plus x% of 200. The retail price (R) can be calculated as follows: R = 200 + (200 * x/100) When the employee applies the 10% discount, they pay 90% of the retail price. So, the price the employee paid (P) is: P = 0.9 * R We know that the employee paid 216 for the recorder, so we can set up the equation: 216 = 0.9 * R Now we can substitute the expression for R from the first equation into the second equation: 216 = 0.9 * (200 + (200 * x/100)) Now we can solve for x: 216 = 180 + (180 * x/100) Subtract 180 from both sides to isolate the term with x: 36 = (180 * x/100) Now we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 180 and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage: x/100 = 36 / 180 x = (36 / 180) * 100 x = 0.2 * 100 x = 20 Therefore, the percentage markup on the wholesale cost was boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"f x text{ Y } y is defined as x text{ Y } y = x^2 3xy + y^2, find the value of 4 text{ Y } 3.","completion":"Given that x text{ Y } y = x^2 - 3xy + y^2, we need to calculate 4 text{ Y } 3: [ 4 text{ Y } 3 = 4^2 - 3(4)(3) + 3^2 ] [ = 16 - 36 + 9 ] [ = 25 - 36 ] [ = -11 ] So, (boxed{-11}) is the solution."},{"prompt":"A train travels from New York to Chicago at an average rate of 60 miles per hour and arrives in Chicago at 5:00 in the evening, Chicago time.

Given f(x)=sin 2x - cosleft(x+frac{3pi}{4}right), we can use trigonometric identities to simplify this expression. Recall that sin 2x = 2sin xcos x and cosleft(x+frac{3pi}{4}right) = -sin x - cos x (using the cosine of sum formula and the fact that sinleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) = cosleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}). Thus, we can rewrite f(x) as: [ f(x) = 2sin xcos x + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(sin x + cos x) ] Next, let t = sin x + cos x. We can express t in terms of a single trigonometric function using the identity sin x + cos x = sqrt{2}sinleft(x+frac{pi}{4}right). Therefore, t can range from -sqrt{2} to sqrt{2} because the sine function ranges from -1 to 1.

Since points A and D are aligned vertically, and Rohit moved 20 meters from B to C (which is the same distance from A to D), we know that the horizontal distance between A and E is 20 meters (the distance from A to D) plus 15 meters (the distance from D to E), which equals 35 meters.

The outflow rate is given by the function ( w = 120 sqrt{6 t} ) where ( t ) is the time in hours ( ( 0 leq t leq 24 ) ). Part (1): 1. **Establishing Definitions:** Let's denote ( m ) as the constant hourly inflow rate of water in cubic meters. We need to find ( m ) such that the total water inflow over 24 hours equals the total water outflow, ensuring the water volume remains 400 cubic meters at the next midnight. 2. **Total Inflow Calculation:** The total inflow over 24 hours would be: [ text{Total Inflow} = 24m ] 3. **Total Outflow Calculation:** The outflow rate ( w ) over 24 hours is given by integrating the function ( w ) from ( t = 0 ) to ( t = 24 ): [ text{Total Outflow} = int_{0}^{24} 120 sqrt{6 t} , dt ] 4. **Performing Integration:** Since: [ int 120 sqrt{6t} , dt ] we make the substitution ( u = 6t ) and ( du = 6 , dt ). Hence ( dt = frac{du}{6} ). [ int 120 sqrt{6t} , dt = int 120 sqrt{u} frac{du}{6} ] Simplifying, we get: [ int 120 sqrt{6t} , dt = 20 int u^{1/2} , du ] Integrating, we obtain: [ 20 int u^{1/2} , du = 20 cdot frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} = frac{40}{3} u^{3/2} ] Substituting back ( u = 6t ): [ frac{40}{3} (6t)^{3/2} = frac{40 cdot 6^{3/2}}{3} t^{3/2} = frac{40 cdot 36 sqrt{6}}{3} t^{3/2} = 480 sqrt{6} t^{3/2} ] Evaluating from 0 to 24: [ text{Total Outflow} = 480 sqrt{6} [(24)^{3/2} - (0)^{3/2}] = 480 sqrt{6} cdot 144 = 69,120 ] 5. **Balancing Inflow and Outflow:** [ 24m = 69,120 ] 6. **Solving for ( m ):** [ m = frac{69,120}{24} = 2,880 ] Thus, the inflow rate required to keep the water volume constant is: [ boxed{60 text{ cubic meters per hour}} ] Part (2): 1. **Expression for Water Volume:** Let ( y ) be the water volume at time ( t ) hours. Then: [ y = 400 + 60t - 120sqrt{6t} ] 2. **Transforming the Problem:** Let ( x = sqrt{6t} ). Thus, ( t = frac{x^2}{6} ). Substituting in the equation: [ y = 400 + 60 left( frac{x^2}{6} right) - 120 x = 400 + 10 x^2 - 120 x ] 3. **Simplifying the Quadratic Expression:** [ y = 10x^2 - 120x + 400 ] 4. **Completing the Square:** To find the minimum value, complete the square: [ y = 10(x^2 - 12x) + 400 = 10((x-6)^2 - 36) + 400 = 10(x-6)^2 - 360 + 400 = 10(x-6)^2 + 40 ] 5. **Finding the Minimum Value:** The minimum value occurs when ( (x-6)^2 = 0 ), i.e., at ( x = 6 ). Substituting back ( x = 6 ) gives ( sqrt{6t} = 6 ), thus: [ 6t = 36 implies t = 6 ] Hence, the minimum water volume is: [ y_{text{min}} = 10 cdot 0^2 + 40 = 40 ] Thus, the minimum water volume at 6 hours is: [ boxed{40} ]"},{"prompt":"here are n points on the plane,any two vertex are connected by an edge of red,yellow or green,and any triangle with vertex in the graph contains exactly 2 colours.prove that n<13","completion":"To prove that ( n < 13 ) for the given problem, we will proceed with the following steps: 1. **Initial Observation:** Suppose there are ( n ) points on the plane, and any two vertices are connected by an edge of red, yellow, or green. Any triangle formed by these vertices must contain exactly 2 colors. 2. **Contradiction with 6 Edges of the Same Color:** If one of the vertices, say ( v ), has at least 6 edges of the same color, say red, then we can form a triangle with 3 vertices connected by red edges. This triangle would not satisfy the condition of having exactly 2 colors. Hence, no vertex can have 6 or more edges of the same color. 3. **Case with 5 Edges of the Same Color:** If a vertex ( v ) has 5 edges of the same color, say yellow, let ( S ) be the set of vertices connected to ( v ) by yellow edges. Then ( G - S ) (the graph excluding ( S )) must have no yellow edges. This is because any edge from ( G - S ) to ( S ) must be yellow, which would again form a triangle with only one color (yellow), contradicting the condition. 4. **Case with ( n geq 13 ):** If ( n geq 13 ), then ( n ) must be 13, and every vertex must have 4 edges of each color (red, yellow, and green). This is because if any vertex had more than 4 edges of the same color, it would contradict the previous steps. 5. **Double Counting Argument:** We will double count the number of pairs of edges that are adjacent together at one vertex and have the same color. The total number of triangles in a complete graph with 13 vertices is given by: [ binom{13}{3} = frac{13 times 12 times 11}{6} = 286 ] Each vertex has 4 edges of each color, and we need to count the number of pairs of edges of the same color at each vertex. For each vertex, the number of ways to choose 2 edges of the same color is: [ binom{4}{2} = 6 ] Since there are 13 vertices, the total number of such pairs is: [ 13 times 3 times 6 = 234 ] This is less than 286, which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( n ) cannot be 13. Conclusion: Since ( n geq 13 ) leads to a contradiction, we conclude that ( n < 13 ).

Therefore, the theorem holds when p=2. 3. **General p > 2**: Next, we consider a prime number p greater than 2. 4. **Case n neq qp-1**: Consider the product involved in the binomial coefficient C_n^{p-1}: [ n(n-1)(n-2) cdots (n-(p-2)) ] Among these p-1 consecutive integers, at least one must be a multiple of p because p is a prime and not all p-1 integers can be coprime to p. Therefore, we can represent it as: [ (n-1)(n-2) cdots (n-(p-2)) = spA ] where A denotes the product of the remaining p-2 factors and s is an integer. Since C_n^{p-1} is an integer, it follows that: [ frac{n(n-1)(n-2) cdots (n-(p-2))}{(p-1)!} ] must also be an integer. Because p is a prime, and p does not divide any of the terms in (p-1)!, we conclude: [ (p-1)! mid spA ] Since p does not divide (p-1)!, we have: [ (p-1)! mid sA ] implying: [ p bigglvert frac{spA}{(p-1)!} ] Therefore, we have: [ C_n^{p-1} equiv 0 pmod{p} ] 5. **Case n = qp-1**: For n = qp-1, we consider the binomial coefficient: [ C_{qp-1}^{p-1} = frac{(qp-1)(qp-2) cdots ((q-1)p)}{(p-1)!} ] Here, we can express: [ (qp-1)(qp-2) cdots ((q-1)p) = f(qp) + (p-1)! ] where f(qp) is a polynomial function involving factors containing qp. Thus: [ C_{qp-1}^{p-1} = frac{f(qp) + (p-1)!}{(p-1)!} = frac{f(qp)}{(p-1)!} + 1 ] Since f(qp) involves factors containing qp, we have: [ frac{pf'(q)}{(p-1)!} + 1 quad (text{where } f'(q) = frac{f(qp)}{p}) ] Clearly: [ frac{pf'(q)}{(p-1)!} in mathbf{Z} ] Because (p, (p-1)!) = 1, we conclude: [ (p-1)! mid f'(q) ] ensuring: [ p bigglvert frac{pf'(q)}{(p-1)!} + 1 implies C_{qp-1}^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ] In summary, we have shown that: - If n neq qp-1, then C_n^{p-1} equiv 0 pmod{p}. - If n = qp-1, then C_{qp-1}^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}.

Let these solutions be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). Then: [ P_n(a_i) = n quad text{for} quad i = 1, 2, ldots, n ] This implies: [ a_i Q(a_i) = n quad text{for} quad i = 1, 2, ldots, n ] 3. **Form of ( Q(x) )**: Since ( Q(x) ) must be an integer polynomial, we can write: [ Q(x) = c(x - b_1)(x - b_2) cdots (x - b_{n-1}) ] where ( c ) is a non-zero integer and ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1} ) are distinct integers. 4. **Product of Roots**: Substituting ( Q(x) ) into the equation ( a_i Q(a_i) = n ), we get: [ a_i c (a_i - b_1)(a_i - b_2) cdots (a_i - b_{n-1}) = n ] Since ( a_i ) are distinct integers, none of them can be zero. Therefore, we have: [ n = c a_1 (a_1 - b_1)(a_1 - b_2) cdots (a_1 - b_{n-1}) ] and similarly for ( a_2, a_3, ldots, a_n ). 5. **Bounding ( n )**: For ( n geq 3 ), consider the product of ( n ) distinct integers. The smallest product of ( n ) distinct non-zero integers is: [ 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdots n = n! ] However, we need to consider the absolute value of the product of ( n ) distinct integers, which can be much larger. For simplicity, we use the inequality: [ n geq 2^{n-2} ] This inequality holds for ( n geq 3 ). Solving ( n leq 4 ) for ( n geq 3 ), we get ( n = 3 ) or ( n = 4 ). 6. **Verification for Small ( n )**: - For ( n = 1 ): [ P_1(x) = x ] This satisfies ( P_1(0) = 0 ) and ( P_1(1) = 1 ). - For ( n = 2 ): [ P_2(x) = 2 - (x-1)(x-2) ] This satisfies ( P_2(0) = 0 ) and ( P_2(1) = 2 ), ( P_2(2) = 2 ). - For ( n = 3 ): [ P_3(x) = 3 + (x-1)(x+1)(x+3) ] This satisfies ( P_3(0) = 0 ) and ( P_3(1) = 3 ), ( P_3(-1) = 3 ), ( P_3(-3) = 3 ). - For ( n = 4 ): [ P_4(x) = 4 - (x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 4) ] This satisfies ( P_4(0) = 0 ) and ( P_4(1) = 4 ), ( P_4(-1) = 4 ), ( P_4(2) = 4 ), ( P_4(-2) = 4 ).

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get: [70k + b - (60k + b) = 60 - 80] [10k = -20] [k = -2] Substituting k = -2 into the first equation: [60(-2) + b = 80] [-120 + b = 80] [b = 200] Thus, the function expression between y and x is y = -2x + 200. Therefore, we have: [boxed{y = -2x + 200}] Part 2: Determining the selling price for maximum weekly profit Let the weekly profit be w yuan. The profit for selling each kilogram of fruit is the selling price minus the cost price, which is (x - 40) yuan. The total profit is this margin multiplied by the number of kilograms sold, which gives us: [w = (x - 40)(-2x + 200)] [= -2x^2 + 280x - 8000] [= -2(x^2 - 140x + 4000)] [= -2(x - 70)^2 + 1800] Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 70. At this point, the maximum profit is 1800 yuan. Therefore, we have: [boxed{text{Selling price} = 70 text{ yuan/kg, Maximum profit} = 1800 text{ yuan}}] Part 3: Determining the range of values for m Given the new cost price increases by m yuan per kilogram, the profit function becomes: [w = (x - 40 - m)(-2x + 200)] [= -2x^2 + 2(m + 140)x - 200(m + 40)] The axis of symmetry for this quadratic function is at: [x = frac{-b}{2a} = frac{2(m + 140)}{2(-2)} = frac{m + 140}{2}] For the profit to decrease as the selling price increases beyond 76 yuan per kilogram, the axis of symmetry must be less than or equal to 76, which gives us: [frac{m + 140}{2} leq 76] [m + 140 leq 152] [m leq 12] Since m > 0, the range of values for m is 0 < m leq 12.

Since the percentage decrease is what we're looking for, we'll convert r into a percentage at the end of our calculation. Given that B receives 80 units of grain, we can express the amounts received by A and C in terms of r and the amount received by B. Since the distribution decreases proportionally, A receives more than B, and C receives less than B, following the proportional distribution ratio. 1. A receives frac{80}{1-r} units of grain because A is before B and thus receives more due to the proportional increase. 2. C receives 80(1-r) units of grain because C is after B and thus receives less due to the proportional decrease. The sum of what A and C receive is given as 164 units. Therefore, we can set up the equation: [ frac{80}{1-r} + 80(1-r) = 164 ] To solve for r, we first simplify the equation: [ 80left(frac{1}{1-r} + 1-rright) = 164 ] [ frac{80}{1-r} + 80 - 80r = 164 ] [ frac{80 - 80r + 80 - 80r}{1-r} = 164 ] [ frac{160(1-r)}{1-r} = 164 ] Since the (1-r) cancels out, we simplify the equation to find the value of r: [ 160 = 164 ] This simplification step was incorrect in our process.

Thus, the conclusion holds for the base case. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the conclusion holds for ( n ). This means any natural number ( a ) less than or equal to ( n! ) can be expressed as the sum of at most ( n ) distinct divisors of ( n! ). We need to show that the conclusion holds for ( n + 1 ). That is, any natural number ( b ) less than or equal to ( (n + 1)! ) can be expressed as the sum of at most ( n + 1 ) distinct divisors of ( (n + 1)! ). Let ( b leq (n+1)! ). We can express ( b ) in the form: [ b = (n + 1) cdot d + r ] where ( d leq n! ) and ( 0 leq r < n + 1 ). By the induction hypothesis, ( d ) can be expressed as the sum of at most ( n ) distinct divisors of ( n! ), such that: [ d = d_1 + d_2 + cdots + d_l ] where ( d_i ) are distinct divisors of ( n! ) and ( l leq n ). Substitute this expression into the equation for ( b ): [ b = (n + 1) cdot d_1 + (n + 1) cdot d_2 + cdots + (n + 1) cdot d_l + r ] Notice: - Each term ((n + 1) cdot d_i) is a divisor of ((n + 1)!) (since (d_i) is a divisor of ( n! )). - There are ( l leq n ) such terms, plus possibly an additional term ( r ). - Thus, the total number of distinct terms in the sum is at most ( l + 1 leq n + 1 ). Furthermore, since ( r < n + 1 ), ( r ) can be one of the numbers ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, n ). Thus, each term in the sum is a divisor of ((n + 1)!), and the terms are distinct. Therefore, ( b ) can be expressed as the sum of at most ( n + 1 ) distinct divisors of ((n + 1)!). Hence, by mathematical induction, for any natural number ( n ), any natural number not exceeding ( n! ) can be expressed as the sum of at most ( n ) distinct divisors of ( n! ).

In geometrical terms, the triangle must be acute-angled if this condition holds. 2. **Circumscribed Circle (Γ):** Since the triangles are formed by the vertices of a regular polygon of 2007 sides, all these triangles share the same circumscribed circle, denoted by (Gamma). This (Gamma) is the circumcircle of the regular polygon. 3. **Identifying the Unique Triangle:** - The goal is to show that there is exactly one triangle in the triangulation such that the center (O) of (Gamma) lies within the interior of this triangle. - The center (O) of (Gamma) is also the center of the regular polygon. 4. **Geometry of the Polygonal Triangulation:** - In the process of paving (triangulating) the interior of the polygon, consider that each triangle is formed by selecting three vertices of the polygon. - We need to ensure one such formed triangle contains the center (O) inside it. 5. **Uniqueness and Existence Argument:** - Take any arbitrary triangulation of the regular 2007-gon. Because the number of sides (2007) is odd, the diagonals and sides of the polygon are evenly distributed around (O). - Since no diagonal or side can pass exactly through (O) (due to the odd number of sides), such triangulation would involve (O) being strictly inside one triangle. 6. **Counting Argument:** - With 2007 vertices, the total number of triangles would be (2005) (by Euler's formula for planar graphs: (V = 2007), (E = 2007+N-1), where (N) is the number of triangles, and for a triangulation with vertices on a convex polygon, (E = 3N - k) where (k) is linear boundary segments, which simplifies to (N = V-2)). - Every vertex contributes to some triangles but only one triangle will have (O) in its interior due to the nature of (O) being within (Gamma). **Conclusion:** Therefore, by proving that (O) must be strictly inside exactly one triangle of any triangulation of the regular polygon, it is sure that exactly one triangle will have all acute angles.

We need to show that there always exist (n) non-intersecting chords such that each chord connects two points of different colors. We start by defining some terms and concepts to simplify our proof.

There is exactly one chord connecting the two points, and it clearly satisfies the condition. 5. **Inductive Step**: - Assume the hypothesis holds for (n = k), where we can find (k) non-intersecting chords connecting points of different colors. - Now, consider (n = k + 1), meaning we have (2k + 2) points: (k+1) red and (k+1) blue points. - Let (A) be a red point and (B) be a blue point which are adjacent (next to each other) on the circle. Since the configuration is circular, it's always possible to find such a pair. 6. **Reducing the Problem**: - Remove points (A) and (B) from the circle, leaving (2k) points. - According to the inductive hypothesis, among these (2k) points, we can find (k) non-intersecting chords where each chord connects a red point and a blue point. - The chord connecting (A) and (B) will also be added and it will not intersect with any of the other (k) chords found. 7. **Conclusion**: - By adding the chord (A-B) to the set of (k) non-intersecting chords in the remaining (2k) points, we have (k+1) non-intersecting chords. - Hence, for (n = k + 1), the hypothesis also holds true. 8. **Final Argument**: - By the principle of mathematical induction, the hypothesis holds for all (n in mathbb{N}). - Therefore, for any circle divided into (2n) points with (n) red points and (n) blue points, we can always find (n) non-intersecting chords each connecting a red point to a blue point.

We need to prove that: [ p_{1} p_{3} ldots p_{2n-1} = p_{2} p_{4} ldots p_{2n} ] 2. **Height in a Triangle and Relationship to Sides**: Recall a theorem for any triangle ABC inscribed in a circle with radius R: [ h_{c} = frac{ab}{2R} ] where h_{c} is the altitude from vertex C to side AB, and a, b are the lengths of sides BC and CA, respectively. 3. **Distance from Point to Side Formula**: Applying this theorem to each side of the polygon and corresponding chords, we get that the perpendicular distance from point M to A_{k}A_{k+1} is given by: [ p_{k} = frac{M A_{k} cdot M A_{k+1}}{2R} ] 4. **Product of Distances for Odd-Indexed Sides**: Calculating the product of distances p_{1}, p_{3}, ldots, p_{2n-1}, we have: [ p_{1} p_{3} ldots p_{2n-1} = left(frac{M A_{1} cdot M A_{2}}{2R}right) left(frac{M A_{3} cdot M A_{4}}{2R}right) ldots left(frac{M A_{2n-1} cdot M A_{2n}}{2R}right) ] 5.

We need to find the ratio in which the line (s) divides the side (BC). 1. **Observation**: Since the line (s) and the median from (B) divide the altitude from (C) into three equal parts, the point where the altitude intersects the median is divided into a (2:1) ratio from vertex (C). 2. **Identifying triangles**: The altitude from (C) also serves as a median in the isosceles triangle (Delta ABC) where (AC=BC). 3. **Setting up points and segments**: Let the point where the line (s) intersects the altitude (CH) be (K), and the point where it intersects the side (BC) be (P). It follows that (Delta AKB) is also isosceles. 4. **Parallel and similar triangles**: Now, consider point (M) on (BC) such that (KM) is parallel to (AB). Since (KM parallel AB), (KM) is the angle bisector of (angle BKC). 5. **Establishing similarity**: Triangles (Delta CKM) and (Delta CHB) are similar with a ratio of (3:1) because the segments on (CH) are divided into three equal parts by (K). Hence, (K) splits (Delta ABC) into similar smaller triangles. 6. **Scale factor from base**: Given the similar triangles (Delta RKM) and (Delta RAB), we find the scale factor is (6:1), indicating that (frac{RK}{KB}=1:5), leading us to (PM:MB=1:5). 7. **Ratio determination**: Define (x = CP) and (y = PM).

The shopkeeper sold the book with a 5% discount and earned a profit of 42.5%. This means the selling price (SP) after the discount is such that it includes the cost price plus 42.5% profit. First, let's calculate the selling price with the discount: Profit = Profit percentage * Cost price Profit = 42.5% of 100 Profit = 0.425 * 100 Profit = 42.50 So, the selling price with the profit included is: SP with profit = CP + Profit SP with profit = 100 + 42.50 SP with profit = 142.50 Now, this selling price is after a 5% discount. Let's denote the original selling price (before discount) as SP_original. The relationship between the discounted selling price and the original selling price is: SP with discount = SP_original - (Discount percentage * SP_original) 142.50 = SP_original - (0.05 * SP_original) 142.50 = SP_original * (1 - 0.05) 142.50 = SP_original * 0.95 Now, we solve for SP_original: SP_original = 142.50 / 0.95 SP_original = 150 So, if no discount was offered, the selling price would have been 150. Now, let's calculate the profit percentage if no discount was offered: Profit without discount = SP_original - CP Profit without discount = 150 - 100 Profit without discount = 50 Profit percentage without discount = (Profit without discount / CP) * 100% Profit percentage without discount = (50 / 100) * 100% Profit percentage without discount = 0.5 * 100% Profit percentage without discount = 50% Therefore, if no discount was offered, the percentage of profit earned would have been boxed{50%} ."},{"prompt":"Anthony has 9 pencils.

Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 60 kmph + 6 kmph Relative speed = 66 kmph Now, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to meters per second (m/s) because the length of the train is given in meters. To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s Relative speed in m/s = 66 kmph * (5/18) m/s/kmph Relative speed in m/s = 66 * 5/18 Relative speed in m/s = 330/18 Relative speed in m/s = 18.33 m/s (approximately) Now, we have the relative speed in m/s and the length of the train in meters. We can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the man using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance the train needs to cover to pass the man is equal to the length of the train, which is 240 meters.

To solve this problem, we use the following common geometric result: **Lemma**: In a rectangle, any triangle formed by three points inside the rectangle has an area not exceeding half of the area of the rectangle. Let's denote the midpoints of sides (AB, BC, CD, DA) as (E, F, H, G), respectively. The intersection of line segments (EF) and (GH) is (O). Line segments (EF) and (GH) divide the rectangle (ABCD) into four smaller rectangles.

Since these events are independent, we can multiply these probabilities to find the probability of both not passing, which gives frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{12}. The probability of at least one passing is the complement of both not passing, which we find by subtracting this probability from 1: 1 - frac{1}{12} = frac{11}{12}.

Therefore, a quadrilateral with equal diagonals is not guaranteed to be a parallelogram without additional information. This inverse proposition is not universally true. **B: The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other.** - Inverse Proposition: A quadrilateral with diagonals perpendicular to each other is a rhombus. - Analysis: While a rhombus does have perpendicular diagonals, the defining property also includes that the diagonals bisect each other. However, not every quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals is a rhombus; it could be a kite, for example. Hence, this inverse proposition is not universally true. **C: The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal.** - Inverse Proposition: A quadrilateral with diagonals that bisect each other and are equal is a rectangle. - Analysis: This inverse proposition is true. For a quadrilateral, if its diagonals bisect each other and are equal, it must be a rectangle. This is because the only quadrilateral that satisfies both conditions (diagonals that bisect each other and are equal) is a rectangle. **D: The opposite angles are equal.** - Inverse Proposition: Equal angles are opposite angles. - Analysis: While opposite angles in certain quadrilaterals (like parallelograms) are equal, not all pairs of equal angles in a quadrilateral are necessarily opposite.

Thus, the palindrome takes the form of 1bb1. - **Counting total palindromes**: As b has 10 choices (0 through 9), there are 10 palindromes of the form 1bb1. - **Palindromes containing the digit 2**: We place '2' in the b positions: - If the first b is 2: 12b1, where b can be any digit from 0 to 9 (10 possibilities). - If the second b is 2 without repeating the first case: 1b21, the b here can be any digit except 2 to avoid duplication (9 possibilities).

However, the calculation here gives a percentage greater than 100%, which is incorrect. This suggests that I double-counted some palindromes. Let's correct this: Each palindrome from the total 10 must contain the digit '2' in at least one of the b positions, and each configuration (12b1 and 1b21) is distinct since '2' appearing in either b position is considered.

The generating function for such a sequence is ( 1 + t^{p_i} + t^{2p_i} + cdots ). 3. **Express as a Geometric Series**: The generating function for a single term ( p_{i} x_{i} ) is the sum of a geometric series: [ sum_{k=0}^{infty} t^{k p_{i}} = frac{1}{1 - t^{p_{i}}} ] 4. **Combine All Terms**: The generating function for the entire system, which includes all ( p_{i} )'s simultaneously, is the product of the individual generating functions: [ f(t) = left( frac{1}{1 - t^{p_{1}}} right) left( frac{1}{1 - t^{p_{2}}} right) cdots left( frac{1}{1 - t^{p_{n}}} right) ] 5. **Find ( t^r ) Coefficient**: The coefficient of ( t^r ) in the expansion of ( f(t) ) gives ( a_r ), the number of non-negative integer solutions to the given equation. Hence, the generating function solution is: [ f(t) = frac{1}{(1 - t^{p_{1}})(1 - t^{p_{2}}) cdots (1 - t^{p_{n}})} ] To find ( a_r ), we need the coefficient of ( t^r ) in the series expansion of ( f(t) ).

Let ( B_k(x) ) be the set of all subsequences of the decimal expansion of ( x ) with ( k ) digits. We claim that if ( |B_k(x)| leq k ), then ( x ) must be rational. We will prove this by induction on ( k ). - **Base case ( k = 1 )**: If ( |B_1(x)| = 1 ), then ( x ) must be of the form ( 0.yyyldots = frac{y}{9} ) for some digit ( y ), which is rational. - **Inductive step**: Assume the statement holds for ( k ). We need to show it holds for ( k + 1 ). If ( |B_{k+1}(x)| leq k + 1 ), then ( |B_k(x)| leq |B_{k+1}(x)| leq k + 1 ). If ( |B_k(x)| leq k ), then ( x ) is rational by the induction hypothesis. If ( |B_k(x)| = |B_{k+1}(x)| = k + 1 ), then each ( k )-digit sequence uniquely determines the next digit, leading to periodicity and thus rationality of ( x ). 7. **Conclusion**: Since ( x ) is irrational, ( |B(x)| geq 7 ).

How many cups of each flavor were sold yesterday?","completion":"Let's calculate the number of cups sold for each flavor step by step. 1. Winter Melon: Winter Melon made up 35% of the total sales. Since 100 cups were sold in total, we calculate the number of Winter Melon cups as follows: 35% of 100 = 0.35 * 100 = 35 cups 2. Okinawa: Okinawa made up 1/4 of the total sales. So, the number of Okinawa cups sold is: 1/4 of 100 = 0.25 * 100 = 25 cups 3. Taro: It is given that Taro made up the remaining 12 cups. Now, let's calculate the remaining sales after accounting for Winter Melon, Okinawa, and Taro: Total sales - (Winter Melon + Okinawa + Taro) = 100 - (35 + 25 + 12) = 100 - 72 = 28 cups The remaining 28 cups are the combined sales of Chocolate and Thai flavors, which are in the ratio of 3:7. 4. Chocolate and Thai: Let's denote the number of Chocolate cups as 3x and the number of Thai cups as 7x. The total number of these two flavors is 3x + 7x = 10x, which we know is 28 cups. So, we have: 10x = 28 x = 28 / 10 x = 2.8 Now we can find the number of cups for each flavor: Chocolate = 3x = 3 * 2.8 = 8.4 cups Since we can't sell a fraction of a cup, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. However, we must keep in mind that the total must add up to 28 cups. Let's round Chocolate down to 8 cups and adjust Thai accordingly. Thai = 7x = 7 * 2.8 = 19.6 cups Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we get 20 cups for Thai. To confirm, let's add up the Chocolate and Thai cups to ensure they total 28: Chocolate (8 cups) + Thai (20 cups) = 28 cups So, the final sales distribution is: - Winter Melon: 35 cups - Okinawa: 25 cups - Chocolate: 8 cups - Thai: 20 cups - Taro: 12 cups This adds up to the total of boxed{100} cups sold."},{"prompt":"a taxi, a passenger can sit in the front and three passengers can sit in the back.

Therefore, she either calculates: - GCD or LCM of (a_1) and (a_2), - GCD or LCM of the result from the previous step and (a_3), - continuing in this manner until she processes (a_{30}). 3. **LCM Calculation Condition**: Per the problem, out of the 29 operations, Olya must calculate the LCM exactly 2 times. 4. **Analysis of Final Possible Results**: Let's analyze whether the final result can be exactly 300 under these operations. - **Case 1**: If one of the two numbers in the last steps (after LCM operations) is greater than 300. - If either number is greater than 300 and an LCM operation is performed, the result would exceed 300.

The condition states they are distinct natural numbers. 5. **Conclusion**: Upon analyzing all the possible scenarios laid above, it becomes evident that under the provided conditions, achieving the final result of exactly 300 is impossible.

A: (x3)(10x)=40 B: (x+3)(10x)=40 C: (x3)(10+x)=40 D: (x+3)(10+x)=40","completion":"To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and the steps to find the equation that represents the situation correctly. 1. Initially, when there are 3 plants per pot, the average profit per plant is 10 yuan. This means the total profit per pot with 3 plants is 3 times 10 = 30 yuan. 2. When the number of plants per pot is increased by 1, the average profit per plant decreases by 1 yuan. This implies that if x additional seedlings are added to each pot, making the total number of plants per pot 3 + x, the average profit per plant becomes 10 - x yuan. 3. The goal is to make the total profit per pot 40 yuan. Since the total profit is the product of the number of plants per pot and the average profit per plant, we can set up the equation as follows: [ (3 + x) times (10 - x) = 40 ] 4. Simplifying the equation to match the given options, we see that it already matches one of the options provided: [ (x + 3)(10 - x) = 40 ] Therefore, the equation that is consistent with the problem, based on the information given and the steps outlined, is option B: (x+3)(10-x)=40.

What is the percentage in deficit for the second side?","completion":"Let's denote the original length of the first side of the rectangle as L and the original width as W. The measured length (L') is 7% more than the actual length, so L' = L + 0.07L = 1.07L. Let's denote the percentage deficit in the width as x%. The measured width (W') is x% less than the actual width, so W' = W - x%W = W(1 - x/100). The actual area of the rectangle is A = L * W. The calculated area from the measurements is A' = L' * W' = (1.07L) * (W(1 - x/100)). The error in the area is given as 0.5800000000000001%, which means that the calculated area is 0.5800000000000001% more than the actual area. So we can write the following equation: A' = A + 0.0058A Substituting the expressions for A and A' we get: (1.07L) * (W(1 - x/100)) = L * W + 0.0058 * L * W Dividing both sides by L * W, we get: 1.07 * (1 - x/100) = 1 + 0.0058 Now we solve for x: 1.07 - 1.07x/100 = 1.0058 Subtract 1 from both sides: 0.07 - 1.07x/100 = 0.0058 Now we solve for x: 1.07x/100 = 0.07 - 0.0058 1.07x/100 = 0.0642 Now multiply both sides by 100/1.07 to solve for x: x = (0.0642 * 100) / 1.07 x = 6.42 / 1.07 x ≈ 6 Therefore, the percentage deficit for the second side is approximately boxed{6%} ."},{"prompt":"We choose 10 distinct integers between 1 and 100, denoted as ( {x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{10}} ). Show that it is possible to find two disjoint subsets with the same sum.","completion":"1. **Enumeration of subsets:** For a set of 10 distinct integers, there are 2^{10} = 1024 possible subsets. This is because each integer can either be included in a subset or not, leading to (2) choices for each of the 10 integers. 2. **Sum of subsets:** Since these integers are between 1 and 100, the sum of any subset of these integers must be in the range from 1 to (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55) to (100 + 99 + 98 + ... + 91 = 955). For simplicity, we can assume summing each integer can fall between 1 to 1000, recognizing that in this context, the tighter sum intervals noted above could be used but aren't essential for this proof. 3. **Pigeonhole Principle:** The number of distinct subset-sums is bounded by the total number of sums possible. Since there are 1024 subsets and only 955 possible sums (variable based on actual computation, but easily fewer than 1024), by the pigeonhole principle, some subset sums must repeat. Hence, there exist at least two subsets whose sum of elements is the same. Formally, the pigeonhole principle states if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. Here, the 1024 subsets are the items, and the sums (with fewer possibilities) are the containers. 4. **Disjoint sets formation:** Ensuring these subsets are disjoint, we need to consider these overlapping shared elements in any identified equal sum subsets. If two subsets are not disjoint, eliminate the common elements from each subset to form disjoint subsets. The sums still match since shared elements are canceled out from both subsets. For instance, consider two subsets ( A ) and ( B ) which contain common elements ( C ). Remove ( C) from both (A) and ( B): [ A' = A - C ] [ B' = B - C ] The sums of (A') and (B') will still equal since removing the same elements from subsets with equal sums results in the remaining parts also having equal sums. **Conclusion:** By the above steps and the pigeonhole principle, there indeed exist two disjoint subsets among any selection of 10 distinct integers from 1 to 100 which have the same sum. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Find constants A, B, and C such that [frac{8x + 1}{(x 4)(x 2)^2} = frac{A}{x 4} + frac{B}{x 2} + frac{C}{(x 2)^2}.]","completion":"Multiply both sides by (x - 4)(x - 2)^2: [8x + 1 = A(x - 2)^2 + B(x - 4)(x - 2) + C(x - 4).] To solve for A, let x = 4: [8(4) + 1 = A(4 - 2)^2,] [33 = 4A,] [A = frac{33}{4}.] To solve for C, let x = 2: [8(2) + 1 = C(2 - 4),] [17 = -2C,] [C = -frac{17}{2}.] Substitute these values back and simplify: [8x + 1 = frac{33}{4}(x - 2)^2 + B(x - 4)(x - 2) - frac{17}{2}(x - 4).] Simplify terms and separate for B: [B(x - 4)(x - 2) = 8x + 1 - frac{33}{4}(x - 2)^2 + frac{17}{2}(x - 4).] By expanding and matching coefficients, we find: [B(x^2 - 6x + 8) = 8x + 1 - frac{33}{4}x^2 + frac{33}{2}x - 33 + frac{17}{2}x - 34.] Simplify and solve for B.

By repeatedly applying these transformations, we reduce ( k ) to a smaller integer. Eventually, we reach one of the base cases: [ x_1 = 1, quad x_2 = -1, quad x_3 = 3 ] Thus, every integer ( k ) can be expressed in the form of ( x_n ) for some ( n ).

This leads to: [ frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b} = left(a+2bright)left(frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b}right) ] Applying the distributive property, we get: [ = aleft(frac{1}{a}right) + 2bleft(frac{1}{a}right) + aleft(frac{1}{b}right) + 2bleft(frac{1}{b}right) ] Simplifying further, we have: [ = 1 + frac{2b}{a} + frac{a}{b} + 2 ] Combining like terms, this simplifies to: [ = 3 + frac{2b}{a} + frac{a}{b} ] 2. **Applying AM-GM Inequality**: To find the minimum value, we apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality to the terms frac{2b}{a} and frac{a}{b}.

If such a cycle exists, then ( f^{k}(a_1) = a_1 ), meaning that after ( k ) applications of ( f ), ( a_1 ) maps to itself. This contradicts the condition that ( f^{n-2}(x) ) is a constant because the cycle would affect ( f^{n-2}(x) ) making it non-constant. Hence, cycles of length ( k ) cannot exist. 4. Moreover, ( f(x) ) cannot have two or more fixed points. If ( f(a_1) = a_1 ) and ( f(a_2) = a_2 ), then similarly ( f^{n-2}(a_1) = a_1 ) and ( f^{n-2}(a_2) = a_2 ), contradicting that ( f^{n-2}(x) ) should be constant. 5. To find how many such mappings exist, we use the Pigeonhole Principle. Consider the sequence: [ a_1, f(a_1), f^2(a_1), f^3(a_1), ldots, f^n(a_1) ] According to the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two elements in this sequence must be identical since there are ( n+1 ) elements but only ( n ) possible values. 6. However, cycles of elements cannot appear, so there must be a point where the function reaches a fixed point, say ( f^k(a_1) = a_{text{fixed}} ), that will then map to itself. Thus, there should be exactly one fixed point ( a_{text{fixed}} ). 7. Suppose ( f(a_n) = a_n ) is the unique fixed point. Consider elements ( a_i ) such that ( f(a_i) neq a_n ) for ( 1 leq i leq n-3 ). 8. The sequence ( a_i, f(a_i), f^2(a_i), ldots, f^{n-3}(a_i) ) must all be distinct (otherwise, it leads to cycles or additional fixed points, which contradicts our earlier findings). Therefore, we can permute ( n-1 ) elements out of ( n ) without the fixed element ( a_n ). 9.

Let's consider a (10 times 10) table where each cell contains a non-zero digit, i.e., a digit from 1 to 9. 2. A 10-digit number can be formed from each row and from each column of this table, 3. We are given the condition that all 10-digit numbers formed from the rows should be greater than the 10-digit number formed by the digits on the main diagonal. 4. Additionally, the number on the main diagonal should be greater than every 10-digit number formed by the columns. Let's denote: - ( a_{ij} ) as the digit in the (i)-th row and (j)-th column, - ( d_i ) as the digit on the main diagonal, (d_i = a_{ii}). Step-by-step proof: 1. **Observations on Row and Column Numbers:** - For each row, the number is formed as (N_i = a_{i1}a_{i2}...a_{i10}). - For each column, the number is formed as (M_j = a_{1j}a_{2j}...a_{10j}). - The number on the main diagonal is (D = d_1d_2...d_{10}) where (d_i = a_{ii}). 2. **Analysis of Row Numbers:** - Each digit in the row numbers (N_i) should always be greater than or equal to the corresponding diagonal digits (d_i), considering the same position. - To satisfy (N_i > D), we must have (N_i) containing at least one digit (a_{ij}) greater than (d_j) in some position (j). 3. **Analysis of Column Numbers:** - For the diagonal number (D) to be greater than every column number (M_j), the same reasoning applies where each (d_{ii}) must be at least the greatest digit in the respective positions of the columns. 4. **Contradiction Analysis:** - Assume (a_{ij} = d_j) with all digits equal on the diagonal and all row/column positions (a_{ij}). - (N_i > D) implies there is a non-diagonal digit greater than the diagonal digits, violating (a_{ij} = d_j). - If any non-diagonal digit is greater than all diagonal digits in row (i) and this is satisfied for all rows, columns contradiction must arise for (M_j < D). 5. **Conclusion:** - As a result, it's impossible for the given table to simultaneously satisfy both conditions with the construction rules imposed. - This implies we cannot construct such a (10 times 10) table where all row-formed numbers are greater than diagonal-number and diagonal-number greater than all column-formed numbers.

Substituting (40, 80) into y = kx + b gives 80 = 40k + b. Solving these equations simultaneously: - Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get -10 = 5k Rightarrow k = -2. - Substituting k = -2 into 90 = 35k + b, we get 90 = -70 + b Rightarrow b = 160.

The cost is given as 30 yuan per item, and the relationship between selling price and quantity sold is y = -2x + 160. Thus, the equation becomes: 1200 = (x - 30) cdot (-2x + 160). Expanding and solving this quadratic equation, we find that x_1 = 50 and x_2 = 60. Given the constraints that the selling price must be between 30 yuan and 54 yuan, only x = 50 is valid. Therefore, the selling price should be boxed{50 text{ yuan}}. Part 3: Maximizing Daily Profit Let the daily profit w be expressed as w = (x - 30) cdot (-2x + 160).

Also, points ( B ), ( M ), and ( N ) are collinear. We are to find the value of ( r ). 1. **Vector Notations and Proportional Points**: Let's place the regular hexagon ( ABCDEF ) in the coordinate plane with the center at the origin. This allows us to represent vectors in terms of basic unit vectors corresponding to vertices. Assume: [ overrightarrow{AC} = 2mathbf{a}, quad overrightarrow{AF} = 2mathbf{b} ] Since ( M ) divides ( AC ) in the ratio ( r ), we can write: [ overrightarrow{AM} = r cdot overrightarrow{AC} = 2r mathbf{a} ] 2. **Vector Calculations for ( BM )**: The vector ( overrightarrow{AB} ) in the coordinate plane can be derived knowing the symmetry of the hexagon: [ overrightarrow{AB} = mathbf{a} - mathbf{b} ] Therefore, the vector ( overrightarrow{BM} ) is: [ overrightarrow{BM} = overrightarrow{BA} + overrightarrow{AM} = -(mathbf{a} - mathbf{b}) + 2r mathbf{a} = mathbf{b} + (2r - 1) mathbf{a} ] 3. **Vector for ( CN )**: The vector ( overrightarrow{CE} ) can be similarly derived using the properties of the hexagon: [ overrightarrow{CE} = frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{CA} + frac{3}{2} overrightarrow{AF} = 3 mathbf{b} - mathbf{a} ] Point ( N ) divides ( CE ) in the ratio ( r ), hence: [ overrightarrow{CN} = r cdot overrightarrow{CE} = r (3 mathbf{b} - mathbf{a}) = 3r mathbf{b} - r mathbf{a} ] 4. **Vector for ( MN )**: Since ( MN ) can be found by combining ( overrightarrow{MC} ) and ( overrightarrow{CN} ): [ overrightarrow{MC} = overrightarrow{C} - overrightarrow{M} = 2(1-r) mathbf{a} ] Therefore: [ overrightarrow{MN} = overrightarrow{MC} + overrightarrow{CN} = 2(1 - r) mathbf{a} + (3r mathbf{b} - r mathbf{a}) = 3r mathbf{b} + (2 - 3r) mathbf{a} ] 5. **Collinearity Condition**: The condition for collinearity of (overrightarrow{BM}) and (overrightarrow{MN}) is that they are proportional: [ mathbf{b} + (2r - 1) mathbf{a} = k left(3r mathbf{b} + (2 - 3r) mathbf{a}right) ] Comparing coefficients of (mathbf{a}) and (mathbf{b}), we get the conditions: [ 1 = 3rk quad text{and} quad 2r - 1 = k(2 - 3r) ] Solving the first equation for ( k ): [ k = frac{1}{3r} ] Substituting in the second equation: [ 2r - 1 = left(frac{1}{3r}right)(2 - 3r) ] Multiplying both sides by ( 3r ): [ 6r^2 - 3r = 2 - 3r ] Simplifying: [ 6r^2 = 2 implies r^2 = frac{1}{3} implies r = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} ] # Conclusion [ boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":") Prove that the bisectors of the exterior angles of a triangle intersect the extensions of the opposite sides of the triangle at three points that lie on the same straight line. b) Prove that the tangents to the circumcircle of a triangle at the vertices of the triangle intersect its opposite sides at three points that lie on the same straight line.","completion":"Part (a): 1. **Prove the intersections lie on one line**: - Consider triangle (ABC) with external angle bisectors intersecting the extensions of the opposite sides. - Let the external angle bisector of (angle A) intersect (BC) at point (D), the external angle bisector of (angle B) intersect (CA) at point (E), and the external angle bisector of (angle C) intersect (AB) at point (F). 2. **Apply Menelaus' Theorem**: - Menelaus’ theorem states that for a transversal line intersecting the sides (or extensions) of triangle (ABC) at points (D), (E), and (F) respectively, we have: [ frac{BD}{DC} cdot frac{CE}{EA} cdot frac{AF}{FB} = 1 ] 3. **Set up the ratio relations**: - Use the properties of external angle bisectors that relate these divisions in terms of sides of the triangle.

Also, connect the previous result from problem 50, which states that these points of intersection lie on a straight line. 3. **Application of Menelaus' theorem** again: - Let points (D), (E), and (F) (as previously defined in the context of tangents) also satisfy: [ frac{BD}{DC} cdot frac{CE}{EA} cdot frac{AF}{FB} = 1 ] - Given by the symmetry and properties of the tangents to the circumcircle, similar relations hold.

Therefore: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a + S - x_i} leq sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{y_i}{a y_i + sum_{j neq i} y_j} ] 5. Consider (a = 1): [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a + S - x_i} leq sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{y_i}{sum_{j=1}^{n} y_i} = 1 ] Thus, when ( x_1 = x_2 = ldots = x_n = 1 ), the equality holds. Hence, ( M = 1 ). 6. For ( a > 1 ): [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a + S - x_i} leq sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{y_i}{(a-1) y_i + 1} ] 7. Using the convexity of ( f(y_i) = frac{1}{(a-1)y_i + 1} ) and Jensen's inequality (or Karamata's inequality): [ sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 - sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{(a-1)y_i + 1} leq n - frac{n^2}{(a-1) sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i + n} = n - frac{n^2}{(a-1) + n} ] 8. Simplifying: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a + S - x_i} leq frac{1}{a-1} left(n - frac{n^2}{(a-1) + n}right) = frac{n}{a-1+n} ] Therefore, ( M = frac{n}{a-1+n} ). Case 2: ( a < 1 ) 1. By applying the Sugary Water Inequality: [ frac{1}{a+S-x_i} = frac{1}{a} cdot frac{a}{a+S-x_i} leq frac{1}{a} cdot frac{1}{1+S-x_{i}} ] 2. Using the conclusion from ( a = 1 ): [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a + S - x_i} = frac{1}{a} sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{a}{a + S - x_i} leq frac{1}{a} sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{1+S-x_i} leq frac{1}{a} ] 3. When ( x_{1} = x_{2} = ldots = x_{n-1} = varepsilon ) and ( x_{n} = varepsilon^{1-n} ), and letting ( varepsilon rightarrow 0^{+} ), [ sum_{i=1}^{n} frac{1}{a+S-x_i} rightarrow frac{1}{a} ] So, ( M = frac{1}{a} ). In summary, we have: [ M = left{ begin{array}{l l} frac{n}{a-1+n} & text{if } a geq 1 frac{1}{a} & text{if } 0 < a < 1 end{array} right. ] (boxed{left{frac{n}{a-1+n},frac{1}{a}right}})"},{"prompt":"Andrew purchased 14 kg of grapes at the rate of 54 per kg and 10 kg of mangoes at the rate of 62 per kg.
