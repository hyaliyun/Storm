By the definition of a parabola, the directrix is equidistant from the focus, which implies that the directrix coincides with the left focus of the hyperbola.

This means h(x) is increasing on the interval (0,e) and decreasing on (e,+infty). Also, since h(1) = 0 and h(x) > 0 for x in (1,+infty), we can analyze the behavior of h(x) in relation to a and x. 1. For x in (0,1), if ae^{x} geq 1, then a geq frac{1}{{e}^{x}}, implying a geq 1 since x in (0,1). In this case, h(ae^{x}) geq 0 > h(x). 2. For x in (0,1), if 0 < ae^{x} < 1, then a < frac{1}{{e}^{x}}, so a < 1. If ae^{x} > x, i.e., a > frac{x}{{e}^{x}}, we analyze the function g(x) = frac{x}{{e}^{x}}. The derivative of g(x) is: [ g'(x) = frac{{e}^{x}(1-x)}{{e}^{2x}} ] For x in (0,1), g'(x) > 0, indicating that g(x) is monotonically increasing on this interval. Therefore, a geq g(1) = frac{1}{e}. Combining these observations, we conclude that a must be in the interval [frac{1}{e}, 1).

According to the information given: 1. The average monthly income of P and Q is Rs. 2050. Therefore, the sum of their incomes is 2 * 2050 = Rs. 4100. So, we have: P + Q = 4100 ... (Equation 1) 2. The average monthly income of Q and R is Rs. 5250. Therefore, the sum of their incomes is 2 * 5250 = Rs. 10500. So, we have: Q + R = 10500 ... (Equation 2) 3. The average monthly income of P and R is Rs. 6200. Therefore, the sum of their incomes is 2 * 6200 = Rs. 12400. So, we have: P + R = 12400 ... (Equation 3) Now, we can solve these equations to find the monthly income of P. First, let's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3 to eliminate Q: (P + R) - (P + Q) = 12400 - 4100 R - Q = 8300 ...

Two rats bore through the wall from opposite sides. The big rat bores through at a rate of one foot per day, and the small rat also at a rate of one foot per day. The big rat doubles its rate each day, while the small rat halves its rate each day. How many days will it take for the two rats to meet, and how much will each have bored? Given that the wall is 5 feet thick, consider the following statements: (1) The small rat bores through half a foot on the second day; (2) It takes four days for the two rats to meet; (3) If the big rat were to die after boring for two days, then the small rat would continue boring until its death. How many of these statements are incorrect? A: 0 B: 1 C: 2 D: 3","completion":"Let's analyze each statement step by step: - **Statement 1**: For the small rat, on the first day, it bores through one foot with a rate halving each day. Hence on the second day, it will bore a distance of 1 times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}, which is indeed half a foot. Therefore, statement 1 is correct. - **Statement 2**: To calculate the number of days the rats will meet, let's denote the number of days as n. Using the information given: - The big rat’s total distance bored is a geometric sequence with the first term of 1 foot and a common ratio of 2, therefore the sum of distances after n days is S_{text{big}} = 2^n - 1. - The small rat’s total distance bored is a geometric sequence with the first term also of 1 foot but with a common ratio of frac{1}{2}, therefore the sum after n days is S_{text{small}} = 2 - frac{1}{2^{n-1}}. The wall is 5 feet thick, hence S_{text{big}} + S_{text{small}} = 5. Substituting in the sums, we have: 2^n - 1 + 2 - frac{1}{2^{n-1}} = 5 implies 2^n - frac{1}{2^{n-1}} = 4 Solving for n gives 2 < n < 3, so they meet in less than 3 days. Statement 2 is therefore incorrect. - **Statement 3**: If the big rat dies after two days of boring, a total distance of 1 + 2 = 3 feet would be bored by it, and the small rat would have bored 1 + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2} feet at that point. Thus, 3 + frac{3}{2} = frac{7}{2} feet would have been bored through by both rats combined, leaving frac{10}{2} - frac{7}{2} = frac{3}{2} feet of wall remaining. Let k be the number of days needed for the small rat to bore through the remaining wall. The total distance bored by the small rat on the following days forms a geometric sequence starting with frac{1}{4} and a common ratio of frac{1}{2}. The sum of these distances must equal the remaining wall thickness of frac{3}{2} feet. However, this requires an infinite number of days as the small rat's boring rate gets infinitesimally small. Therefore, the small rat would bore until its death, making statement 3 correct. Thus, the only incorrect statement is number 2.

This simplifies to -6 = frac{b}{5}, which gives us b = -30. However, this part of the solution seems to be incorrectly interpreted from the standard solution. Correctly interpreting the standard answer should provide: - The sum of the roots equals frac{-(-5)}{a}, which simplifies to frac{5}{a} = -1, leading to a contradiction with the initial interpretation.

The correct interpretation from the standard solution is that it helps in finding the correct values of a and b when considering the general quadratic formula implications (sum of roots = -frac{b}{a} and product = frac{c}{a}). - The misinterpretation leads to reevaluating a and b based on the actual quadratic relationships: a = -5 and b = 30, based on correctly applying the formulas for sum and product of roots to the given roots and equation. # Step 3: Apply the Values to the New Inequality With the corrected values of a=-5 and b=30, substitute these into the new inequality bx^{2}-5x+a > 0: - This gives us 30x^{2}-5x-5 > 0. # Step 4: Solve the New Inequality Solving 30x^{2}-5x-5 > 0 can be done using various methods, including factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula.

We need to find the probability P(N) that at least frac{3}{5} of the green balls are on the same side of the red ball. 2. **Initial Observations:** - For N=5, all green balls must be on one side of the red ball, so P(5) = 1. - As N increases, the red ball has more positions it can occupy relative to the green balls, affecting the probability P(N). 3. **Generalizing for Any N:** - The red ball can be placed in any of the N+1 positions (considering spaces between and on the ends of the green balls). - To satisfy the condition that at least frac{3}{5} of the green balls are on one side, the red ball must be placed in such a way that either the first frac{2}{5}N positions or the last frac{2}{5}N positions are not occupied by it. - This leaves frac{3}{5}N + 1 valid positions for the red ball (since we round up the number of positions to the nearest whole number when dealing with discrete balls). 4. **Calculating P(N):** - The probability P(N) is then the ratio of the number of favorable positions to the total positions: [ P(N) = frac{leftlceil frac{3}{5}N + 1 rightrceil}{N+1} ] - Simplifying, we approximate: [ P(N) approx frac{frac{3}{5}N + 1}{N+1} ] 5. **Setting Up the Inequality:** - We need P(N) < frac{321}{400}.

Since (|z_k| = 1), we have: [ z_k^3 = (cos(theta_k) + isin(theta_k))^3 = cos(3theta_k) + isin(3theta_k) ] and [ overline{z_k} = cos(theta_k) - isin(theta_k) ] 3. **Substituting into the Given Equation:** Substitute (z_k^3) and (overline{z_k}) into the given equation: [ sum_{k=1}^n (cos(3theta_k) + isin(3theta_k)) = 4(a + (a-n)i) - 3 sum_{k=1}^n (cos(theta_k) - isin(theta_k)) ] 4. **Separating Real and Imaginary Parts:** Separate the real and imaginary parts of the equation: [ sum_{k=1}^n cos(3theta_k) + i sum_{k=1}^n sin(3theta_k) = 4a + 4(a-n)i - 3 sum_{k=1}^n cos(theta_k) + 3i sum_{k=1}^n sin(theta_k) ] Equate the real and imaginary parts: [ sum_{k=1}^n cos(3theta_k) = 4a - 3 sum_{k=1}^n cos(theta_k) ] [ sum_{k=1}^n sin(3theta_k) = 4(a-n) + 3 sum_{k=1}^n sin(theta_k) ] 5. **Using Trigonometric Identities:** Recall the trigonometric identities: [ cos(3theta) = 4cos^3(theta) - 3cos(theta) ] [ sin(3theta) = 3sin(theta) - 4sin^3(theta) ] Substitute these into the equations: [ sum_{k=1}^n (4cos^3(theta_k) - 3cos(theta_k)) = 4a - 3 sum_{k=1}^n cos(theta_k) ] [ sum_{k=1}^n (3sin(theta_k) - 4sin^3(theta_k)) = 4(a-n) + 3 sum_{k=1}^n sin(theta_k) ] 6. **Simplifying the Equations:** Simplify the real part equation: [ 4 sum_{k=1}^n cos^3(theta_k) - 3 sum_{k=1}^n cos(theta_k) = 4a - 3 sum_{k=1}^n cos(theta_k) ] [ 4 sum_{k=1}^n cos^3(theta_k) = 4a ] [ sum_{k=1}^n cos^3(theta_k) = a ] Simplify the imaginary part equation: [ 3 sum_{k=1}^n sin(theta_k) - 4 sum_{k=1}^n sin^3(theta_k) = 4(a-n) + 3 sum_{k=1}^n sin(theta_k) ] [ -4 sum_{k=1}^n sin^3(theta_k) = 4(a-n) ] [ sum_{k=1}^n sin^3(theta_k) = n - a ] 7. **Combining the Results:** Combine the results: [ sum_{k=1}^n cos^3(theta_k) + sum_{k=1}^n sin^3(theta_k) = a + (n - a) = n ] From the lemma, we know that (cos^3(theta_k) + sin^3(theta_k) leq 1).

How many gallons of fuel does the empty plane need per mile?","completion":"Let's denote the fuel needed for the empty plane per mile as F gallons. Each person on the plane increases the fuel consumption by 3 gallons per mile. Since there are 30 passengers and 5 crew members, that's a total of 35 people. Each person brought two bags, which means there are 70 bags in total. Each bag increases the fuel consumption by 2 gallons per mile. So, the total additional fuel needed per mile due to people and bags is: (35 people * 3 gallons/person/mile) + (70 bags * 2 gallons/bag/mile) This simplifies to: (105 gallons/mile) + (140 gallons/mile) = 245 gallons/mile Now, we know that the plane needs 106,000 gallons of fuel for a 400-mile trip. This includes the fuel for the empty plane and the additional fuel due to people and bags. So, the total fuel consumption per mile is: 106,000 gallons / 400 miles = 265 gallons/mile This total fuel consumption per mile includes the fuel needed for the empty plane plus the additional fuel due to people and bags.

From the given conditions, we have b = c. The equation of the line connecting a short axis endpoint and a focus can be frac{x}{c} + frac{y}{b} = 1, i.e., x + y - b = 0. By tangency between the line and the circle, we obtain |b| = sqrt{2}, so b = 2. Hence, c = 2, a^2 = b^2 + c^2 = 8, and the equation of the ellipse C is frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1. (2) The focus of the parabola E is on the positive semi-axis of x, so F(2, 0). Thus, p = 4, and the equation of the parabola E is y^2 = 8x.

Solution Method** 1. **Arrival and Assignment to Rooms**: - Consider the participants arriving one by one. Each participant checks the current occupants of Room I, Room II, and Room III and is directed to a room where they have no prior acquaintances. 2. **First Attempt Assignment**: - If a participant finds no acquaintances in Room I, they will stay in Room I. 3. **Second Attempt Assignment**: - If the participant finds acquaintances in Room I but none in Room II, they will be assigned to Room II. 4. **Third Attempt Assignment**: - If the participant finds acquaintances in both Room I and Room II but none in Room III, they will be assigned to Room III. 5. **Contradiction and Proof of Termination**: - Suppose a participant ( A ) encounters an acquaintance ( B ) in Room III. This implies ( A ) must have had acquaintances in Room I and Room II as well, hence ( A ) knew someone in Room I, someone else in Room II, and ( B ) in Room III. - ( B ), being in Room III, must have had acquaintances in Room II (( C )) and Room I (( D )). This creates the chain ( A )-( B )-( C )-( D ), contradicting the initial problem statement that no such chain should exist. - Thus, every participant can be placed without requiring a fourth room, proving that the process terminates correctly within three rooms. **II. Solution Method** 1. **Phase 1: Guests with At Least Three Acquaintances**: - Group all participants who have at least three acquaintances. None of these participants can know each other. - Each member ( E ) in this group has at least two other mutual acquaintances distinct from any given member ( F ). Therefore, if ( E ) and ( F ) knew each other, it would lead to four people forming a chain, violating our initial condition. 2. **Phase 2: Remaining Guests**: - Treat the remaining participants, each having at most two acquaintances. - Each of these participants will find a room where none of their at most two acquaintances is present. This guarantees placement within three attempts (Room I, Room II, Room III). - This method ensures all participants are accommodated without contradicting the no-four-chain requirement. 3. **Justification for Optimization**: - Each guest with up to two acquaintances is placed effectively into one of the rooms without the necessity of a fourth room since any existing acquaintances will fit into the room arrangement without forming a chain longer than three. **Conclusion**: The process validates that the given arrangement algorithm can accommodate the party participants within 3 rooms while ensuring no room has any two participants who know each other, adhering to the constraints provided.

The reference solution hints that it's impossible to achieve the correct arrangement with all 9 balls, but possible with 8 balls. 2. **Key Detail**: - Balls numbered 5 and 7 can have only one neighbor, which is ball numbered 1. - This suggests a critical constraint where both balls numbered 5 and 7 must be adjacent to the ball numbered 1. 3. **Impossibility of Arranging 9 Balls**: - If we attempt to arrange all 9 balls, the positions of balls 5 and 7 are influenced by their required adjacency to ball 1. This creates a contradiction because ball 1 can only occupy one position while trying to fulfill the neighboring requirement of two different balls (5 and 7). - Hence, it is concluded that arranging all 9 balls under the given constraints is not possible. 4. **Viable Solution with 8 Balls**: - By removing one ball, we can adjust positions more effectively. The example provided in the reference solution illustrates a possible arrangement that meets the constraints. - Removing ball 7, we can arrange the remaining 8 balls as: - (9, 3, 6, 2, 4, 8, 1, 5) 5. **Verification**: - In the provided arrangement (9, 3, 6, 2, 4, 8, 1, 5): - \`Ball 1\` is adjacent to \`ball 5\` as required. - \`Ball 7\` has been removed, thus eliminating the earlier contradiction and allowing the constraint satisfaction. - All other balls are arranged without any further constraints given in the problem, making this the correct solution configuration for 8 balls. # Conclusion: The valid configuration with the given constraints is achievable by arranging 8 balls as follows: [ 9, 3, 6, 2, 4, 8, 1, 5 ] [ boxed{9, 3, 6, 2, 4, 8, 1, 5} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the set B={xin mathbb{Z} | 3 < 2x1 < 3}, express the set B by listing its elements.","completion":"**Answer**: According to -3 < 2x-1 < 3 and xin mathbb{Z}, solve this absolute value inequality to get -1 < x < 2 and xin mathbb{Z}.

We need to find the expected number of tie moments (i.e., moments when the score is tied) during the game. # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Modeling the Game as a Random Walk**: - If the maximum total score is 2n, the game can be modeled as a random walk of length 2n. Each step of the walk either increases or decreases the score difference by 1. 2. **Indicator Variables**: - Let (I_{2k}) be an indicator variable that represents a tie (equal score) at step 2k. An indicator random variable typically takes on values in a binary manner (0 or 1), where it is 1 if the event it signifies occurs and 0 otherwise. 3. **Probability of a Tie at Step 2k**: - The probability that there is a tie at the 2k-th step can be derived using combinatorial methods.

To form an equilateral triangle, we need to choose 3 vertices such that they are not adjacent to each other in the hexagon, because if two vertices of the triangle are adjacent on the hexagon, the triangle will share more than one vertex with the hexagon, which is not allowed by the condition given. Let's label the vertices of the hexagon as A, B, C, D, E, and F in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. To form an equilateral triangle, we need to pick every second vertex. There are two distinct ways to do this: 1. Choose vertices A, C, and E. 2. Choose vertices B, D, and F. No other combination of three vertices will form an equilateral triangle without sharing more than one vertex with the hexagon. Since there are only two ways to form an equilateral triangle under the given condition, and there are no other possibilities, the probability of forming such an equilateral triangle is 2 out of the total number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 6, without any restrictions. The total number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 6 is given by the combination formula: C(n, k) = n! / [k! * (n - k)!] Where n is the total number of items (vertices in this case), k is the number of items to choose, and \\"!\\" denotes factorial. So, the total number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 6 is: C(6, 3) = 6! / [3! * (6 - 3)!] = (6 * 5 * 4) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 20 Therefore, the probability P of getting an equilateral triangle from the vertices of a regular hexagon without sharing more than one vertex with the hexagon is: P = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 2 / 20 = 1 / 10 So, the probability is boxed{1/10} or 0.1 (10%)."},{"prompt":"As of December 31, 2013, the scale of Yu'E Bao had reached 1853 billion yuan.

Prove that if a circle has at least 2061 yellow points, there exists a region whose vertices are all yellow.","completion":"Let ( n = 2018 ). To prove the assertion, consider a geometric graph ( G ) formed by ( n ) circles. We need to show that if each circle has at least 2061 yellow points, there exists at least one region entirely bounded by arcs and vertices (formed by intersections of the circles) such that all its vertices are yellow. Here are the successive steps: 1. **Definition of ( G )**: Consider the geometric graph ( G ) formed by 2018 circles. Each circle intersects with other circles creating regions. These regions are bounded by arcs formed by the intersections of the circles. 2. **Analysis of Intersection Points**: An intersection point on any circle is colored either red or blue in an alternating manner. Each intersection point is colored twice (once for each circle it is part of). If both colors assigned to an intersection point from the different circles match, the intersection point remains that color. Otherwise, it is colored yellow. 3. **Odd Intersection Points**: The problem states that each circle has an odd number of intersection points. This means: - Each circle has an odd number of yellow points. - The total number of intersection points on any circle is odd. 4. **Bounding the Number of Yellow Points**: Suppose each circle ( C ) has at most: [ n + leftlfloor sqrt{n-2} rightrfloor - 2 ] yellow points. For ( n = 2018 ), we have: [ 2018 + leftlfloor sqrt{2018-2} rightrfloor - 2 = 2018 + 44 - 2 = 2060 ] This leads to a contradiction if each circle has at least 2061 yellow points which indicates our assumption is wrong. 5. **Induced Subgraph Analysis**: Consider the induced subgraph comprising only yellow vertices. Each region of ( G ) corresponds to a connected set of vertices that are intersection points on the arcs. If every region must have at least one non-yellow vertex under the assumption, we contradict the assertion that each circle must have at least 2061 yellow points. 6. **Proof by Contradiction**: - If each region in ( G ) must have at least one non-yellow vertex, and ( G ) consists of these repeated regions, there must be an accumulation that forces more than ( 2060 ) yellow points on any circle. - Since this satisfies both the principal assumption and the result derived by contradiction, it leads us to infer that such regions must exist where all vertices are yellow. # Conclusion: By analyzing ( n = 2018 ) through its upper bounds and using a contradiction proof regarding intersection points, we confirm the theorem's validity: [ boxed{text{A region exists where all vertices are yellow iff each circle has at least 2061 yellow points}} ]"},{"prompt":"Farmer Pythagoras has a field in the shape of a right triangle.

If one player can do this but the other one cannot, the one who can is the winner; otherwise a draw is declared. Determine all possible first moves of the first player after which he has a winning strategy.","completion":"Given the structure of the problem, we need to identify the strategies that lead to a win for the first player, mathcal{F}, or the second player, mathcal{S}. Let us denote the set of cards by C_{1}, C_{2}, ldots, C_{1024}, where each card contains distinct decimal digits. We need to determine after taking cards alternately, what will the sum of the cards be for each player. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initial Definitions and Sum:** - Each card has a unique subset of decimal digits from 0 to 9. - Let sum denote the symmetric difference operator (triangle), that is A triangle B is a set containing elements that are in A or B, but not in both. - We know that each digit appears on exactly 512 cards. Therefore, the sum of all the cards (using the triangle operator) is: [ C_1 triangle C_2 triangle cdots triangle C_{1024} = varnothing ] because the symmetric difference of an even count of any element results in an empty set. 2. **Winning Condition Interpretation:** - At the end of the game, each player's cards must form a sum (C) such that they can discard a card to make the sum without that card consist of each digit appearing an even number of times. - The crucial point is that the sets of cards held by mathcal{F} and mathcal{S} must both result in a sum of cards being equal to either (the empty set) or the same nonempty card they each possess. 3. **Case Analysis – Choosing a Nonempty Card:** - Let mathcal{F} pick a nonempty card A. We need to ensure that by choosing A, mathcal{F} can force mathcal{S} into a position where mathcal{F} wins. 4. **Detailed Pair Strategy:** - All the cards can be paired according to the operation with any chosen card B: [ {X, X triangle B} text{ for each card set } X ] - Now, let B be the card mathcal{S} picks after mathcal{F}'s initial choice. - mathcal{F} then takes A triangle B. Using this approach, the sums of the cards of mathcal{F} would then be: [ (A, Atriangle B) ] and for mathcal{S}: [ (B) ] - If mathcal{S} tries to complete groups of pairs, mathcal{F} responds by picking the corresponding pair element. 5. **Winning Through Pairing and Symmetric Difference:** - By repeating this response strategy and ensuring mathcal{F} always takes the corresponding paired card, in any scenario, when mathcal{S} is forced to pick the card varnothing, mathcal{F} will have the ability to discard such that they meet the even digits condition. 6. **Conclusion for Winning Strategy:** - If mathcal{F} does not take varnothing initially, they can maintain this pairing strategy to ultimately force mathcal{S} into an unfavorable position, attaining a win.

According to the given information, the cost price of 30 books is equal to the selling price of 40 books. So we can write the equation: 30x = 40y Now, we need to find the gain or loss percentage. To do that, we need to find the relationship between the cost price and the selling price of one book.

If y > x, there is a gain. If y < x, there is a loss. From the equation y = (3x) / 4, we can see that the selling price (y) is less than the cost price (x), which means there is a loss. To find the loss percentage, we use the formula: Loss % = [(Loss) / (Cost Price)] * 100 We know that the loss on one book is (x - y), so we can substitute y with (3x) / 4: Loss = x - (3x) / 4 Loss = (4x - 3x) / 4 Loss = x / 4 Now, we can calculate the loss percentage: Loss % = [(x / 4) / x] * 100 Loss % = (1 / 4) * 100 Loss % = 25% Therefore, the loss percentage is boxed{25%} ."},{"prompt":"The period of the function y = tan(2x + frac{pi}{6}) is ( ).

(a) What is the maximum amount of money Maxim Andreevich can donate monthly to charity? (b) Since Maxim Andreevich is an excellent math teacher, the parents of the students he teaches are willing to offer him higher pay for additional lessons (beyond those he already gives daily). Maxim Andreevich has long taken care of the days when he can no longer work, so he confidently spends all the money he receives monthly. Will Maxim Andreevich agree to their offer? If yes, what should be the payment for overtime lessons so that he agrees to conduct additional lessons? If no, explain why he would refuse such an offer.","completion":"Part (a) 1. **Daily Calculation**: Each working day, Maxim Andreevich has a total of 24 hours. Out of this, he spends 8 hours sleeping. 2. **Time Distribution**: Let L_i be the number of hours per day Maxim Andreevich works as a tutor on the i-th working day, and k_i be the number of hours he spends on rest and household chores. According to the problem, he spends 2L_i hours on his engraving hobby. Therefore, [ text{Total hours} = 24 - 8 - 2L_i - k_i = 16 - 2L_i - k_i. ] 3. **Maximizing Work Hours**: Maxim Andreevich aims to balance his daily schedule such that the number of hours he works as a tutor is equal to the number of hours he spends otherwise, minus the time he dedicates to his hobby: [ 16 - 2L_i - k_i = L_i implies 3L_i = 16 - k_i implies L_i = frac{16 - k_i}{3} ] 4. **Earnings Calculation**: The daily earnings from lessons are then given by 3L_i : [ 3L_i = frac{3(16 - k_i)}{3} = 16 - k_i. ] 5. **Monthly Earnings**: The total monthly earnings, given there are 21 working days, sum up as follows: [ sum_{i=1}^{21} 3L_i = 21 times 16 - sum_{i=1}^{21} k_i = 336 - K^* ] where K^* is the total number of hours spent on rest and household chores during the month. 6. **Monthly Expenses**: Monthly expenses add up to: [ 70 + frac{K^*}{3} text{ thousand rubles}. ] 7. **Balancing Income and Expenses**: Since Maxim Andreevich spends all his earnings, including his investment income of 14 thousand rubles, we equate: [ 14 + 336 - K^* = 70 + frac{K^*}{3} ] 8. **Solving for K^***: Rearrange to solve for K^*: [ 280 - 3K^* = K^* implies 280 = 4K^* implies K^* = 70. ] 9. **Maximum Donation**: Using the time spent on rest and household chores, the maximum possible donation per month can be calculated as: [ frac{K^*}{3} = frac{210}{3} = 70 text{ thousand rubles}. ] Conclusion: [ boxed{70 text{ thousand rubles}} ] Part (b) 1. **Additional Work Hour Wage Calculation**: If offered an increased wage, let the increased wage per hour be A thousand rubles. 2. **New Distribution**: If Maxim Andreevich decides to work tilde{L} hours a month additionally, his new monthly calculation changes. Summing monthly lessons earnings: [ 3 times 42 + A times (tilde{L} - 42) = 126 + 14 times (A - 3) ] 3. **Comparing Income and Expenses**: Monthly expenses with investment earnings: [ 126 + (A-3)(112 - K^*/3) + 14 ] 4. **Maximizing K^***: Since the distribution of rest and household chores will be needed similarly, we recompute the optimal K^* as follows: [ K^* = 210 ] 5. **Comparison**: Even with a higher wage, the additional time required would not exceed the allowable work time minus rest and hobby. **Outcome**: Maxim Andreevich would still focus on a balanced schedule assigning equal weightage to rest and hobbies which means he would not prefer additional wages over his current balance of work and personal life.

Given the equation of line l as (2m+1)x+(m+1)y+m=0, we can rearrange it to isolate the terms involving m: [ (2m+1)x+(m+1)y+m=0 implies x+y+m(2x+y+1)=0 ] This rearrangement suggests that for any value of m, the line passes through a point that satisfies x+y=0 and is independent of m. To find the specific coordinates of point P, we solve the system of equations given by: [ left{begin{array}{l} x+y=0 2x+y+1=0 end{array}right. ] Solving this system, we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate y: [ (2x+y+1)-(x+y)=0 implies x+1=0 implies x=-1 ] Substituting x=-1 into the first equation gives: [ -1+y=0 implies y=1 ] Thus, the coordinates of point P are (-1,1). Given the direction vector overrightarrow{a}=(3,2) of line l', we can find the slope of line l', which is the ratio of the y-component to the x-component of overrightarrow{a}, i.e., frac{2}{3}.

A sixthgrader named Senya started to create a magic square and placed the number 1 in some cell. His younger brother Lyonya decided to help him and placed the numbers 2 and 3 in cells that are adjacent by side to the cell with the number 1. Can Senya still create a magic square after such help?","completion":"To determine if Senya can complete the 4 times 4 magic square, we need to analyze the constraints given the placement of the numbers 1, 2, and 3. 1. **Understanding the sum requirement**: The sum of all numbers in a 4 times 4 magic square is equal. Let's calculate the necessary sum for each row, column, and diagonal: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 16 = frac{16(16 + 1)}{2} = 136, ] which means the sum for each row, column, or diagonal in the 4 times 4 square should be: [ frac{136}{4} = 34. ] 2. **Analyzing possible placements for 1, 2, and 3**: We examine two cases: **Case 1**: If Lenya places the numbers 2 and 3 in the same row or column as the number 1. - Assume Lenya places the numbers as follows: in one row or column with the number 1, e.g., the first row. - These numbers sum up to [ 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. ] - The sum of the remaining numbers in this row or column must be (34 - 6 = 28). Since all numbers used in constructing the magic square are between 1 and 16, there is no number 28 within this range. Thus, constructing a magic square this way is impossible. **Case 2**: If Lenya places one of the numbers (2 or 3) in the same row and the other in the same column as the number 1. - We denote these placements as follows: - Suppose 2 is in the same row as 1. - Suppose 3 is in the same column as 1. - The sum of the row with (1) and (2) should be: [ 1 + 2 + x + y = 34 implies x + y = 31. ] - Similarly, the sum in the column with (1) and (3) should be: [ 1 + 3 + a + b = 34 implies a + b = 30. ] - For (x) and (y) to sum to 31, using the allowable numbers from 1 to 16 (excluding 1, 2, and 3), the only feasible pairs are (15) and (16). - Similarly, for (a) and (b) to sum to 30, using allowed numbers, the feasible pairs would be (14) and (16). Since we cannot have the number 16 available for both uses (in both (15, 16) and (14, 16)), achieving the necessary sums in both the row and the column is impossible given the current setup with (1) already placed. **Conclusion**: Given these constraints, Senya is unable to complete a 4 times 4 magic square correctly after Lenya's placement of 2 and 3.

The total time (T_total) it took for the 80 miles trip at an average speed of 40 mph can be calculated using the formula: T_total = Total Distance / Average Speed T_total = 80 miles / 40 mph = 2 hours Now, let's find out how long it took Tom to travel the first 30 miles at 30 mph. The time (T_first_part) it took to travel the first 30 miles can be calculated using the formula: T_first_part = Distance / Speed T_first_part = 30 miles / 30 mph = 1 hour Since the total trip took 2 hours and the first part took 1 hour, the remaining part of the trip must have taken: T_remaining_part = T_total - T_first_part T_remaining_part = 2 hours - 1 hour = 1 hour Now we know that Tom took 1 hour to travel the remaining part of the trip, which is 80 miles - 30 miles = 50 miles.

Now, equating real and imaginary parts, we get: - Real Part: x = 1 - Imaginary Part: sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - y = 2 Substituting x = 1, the imaginary part becomes sqrt{1 + y^2} - y = 2.

So, we remove 25 grams of the initial solution, which contains 2.5 grams of sugar (since 25 grams is one fourth of the initial solution, and 10% of 25 grams is 2.5 grams).

Mary can pave the entire driveway in 4 hours, so her rate is 1/4 of the driveway per hour. Hillary can pave the entire driveway in 3 hours, so her rate is 1/3 of the driveway per hour. When they work together, Mary's rate increases by 33.33%, and Hillary's rate decreases by 50%. Mary's increased rate is 1/4 + (33.33% of 1/4): 33.33% of 1/4 is 0.3333 * 1/4 = 0.083325 (approximately). So, Mary's new rate is 1/4 + 0.083325 = 0.333325 (approximately). Hillary's decreased rate is 1/3 - (50% of 1/3): 50% of 1/3 is 0.5 * 1/3 = 0.1667 (approximately). So, Hillary's new rate is 1/3 - 0.1667 = 0.1667 (approximately). Now, let's add their rates together to find the combined rate when they work together: Mary's new rate + Hillary's new rate = 0.333325 + 0.1667 = 0.500025 (approximately). The combined rate is 0.500025 of the driveway per hour. To find out how many hours it will take them to pave the entire driveway, we divide 1 (the whole driveway) by their combined rate: 1 / 0.500025 = 1.9999 hours (approximately).

This plane can be visualized as a projection plane itself. 2. **Intersection Line of the Two Planes**: - The intersection line of the two planes (let's call them Plane 1 and Plane 2) is crucial.

This will ease the calculations. Let's denote: - s_{3}^{prime} as the projection of the intersection line L in this third plane. 5. **Construct Auxiliary Perpendicular Plane**: - Consider a line B S_{1} passing through some point B on the intersection line L that is perpendicular to this projection plane. 6. **First Trace of the Plane**: - The first trace of this perpendicular plane is B S_{1}, which intersects the projected intersection line perpendicularly in point S_{1}^{prime}. 7. **Angle Construction**: - The angle between the lines B S_{1} (in the auxiliary plane) and the projection of the intersection line L gives us the desired dihedral angle. This angle can be visualized in the original plane by considering rotations and projections. 8. **Final Step**: - By rotating the auxiliary plane around the line B S_{1} and projecting it back onto the initial plane, we can measure the angle between the two planes.

The projection is thus: |vec{AB}|cos(pi - angle ABC) = 2 cos(pi - 45^{circ}) = 2 cos(135^{circ}) Since cos(135^{circ}) = -cos(45^{circ}) (using cosine of supplementary angles identity), and cos(45^{circ}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we have: 2 cos(135^{circ}) = 2 left(-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) = -sqrt{2} Therefore, the projection of vec{AB} in the direction of vec{BC} is -sqrt{2}.

How many jars of milk were good for sale that week?","completion":"To solve the problem, we start by calculating the total number of cartons delivered after 20 cartons failed to be delivered. Originally, there were 50 cartons, so the calculation goes as follows: - Initial cartons: 50 - Cartons not delivered: 20 Thus, the number of cartons delivered is 50 - 20 = 30 cartons. Next, we calculate the total number of jars in all the delivered cartons. Since each carton contains 20 jars, the total number of jars is: - Number of cartons: 30 - Jars per carton: 20 Therefore, the total number of jars is 30 times 20 = 600 jars. Now, we need to find out the number of jars that were damaged and thus not good for sale. There were 3 jars damaged in each of 5 cartons, and one entire carton was also damaged. The calculation for the jars damaged in the 5 cartons is: - Jars damaged per carton: 3 - Number of cartons with damaged jars: 5 So, the total number of jars damaged in these cartons is 3 times 5 = 15 jars. Since one entire carton was also damaged, and each carton contains 20 jars, the total number of jars damaged including this carton is: - Jars damaged in 5 cartons: 15 - Jars in the entirely damaged carton: 20 Thus, the total number of jars damaged is 15 + 20 = 35 jars. Finally, to find out how many jars were good for sale, we subtract the number of jars damaged from the total number of jars delivered: - Total jars delivered: 600 - Total jars damaged: 35 Therefore, the number of jars good for sale is 600 - 35 = 565 jars.

Note that: [ mathrm{E}[s^X] = mathrm{E}[(s-1 + 1)^X] ] By expanding ((s-1+1)^X) using the binomial theorem, we get: [ (s-1+1)^X = sum_{k=0}^{X} binom{X}{k} (s-1)^k ] Taking the expectation of both sides, we have: [ mathrm{E}[s^X] = mathrm{E}left[sum_{k=0}^{X} binom{X}{k} (s-1)^kright] ] 3. Since the expectation operator is linear, we can interchange the sum and the expectation: [ mathrm{E}[s^X] = sum_{k=0}^{n} (s-1)^k mathrm{E}[binom{X}{k} I(X geq k)] ] 4. According to the problem's given definition of binomial moments, we know: [ mathrm{E}[binom{X}{k}] = b_k ] Therefore: [ mathrm{E}[s^X] = sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k (s-1)^k ] 5. Next, we need to show that (mathrm{E}[s^X]) can also be expressed as: [ mathrm{E}[s^X] = sum_{i=0}^{n} s^i sum_{k=i}^{n} (-1)^{k-i} binom{k}{i} b_k ] 6. Start by expanding ( (s-1)^k ) using the binomial theorem: [ (s-1)^k = sum_{i=0}^{k} binom{k}{i} s^i (-1)^{k-i} ] Then the sum becomes: [ sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k (s-1)^k = sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k left(sum_{i=0}^{k} binom{k}{i} s^i (-1)^{k-i} right) ] 7. Interchanging the sums, we have: [ sum_{k=0}^{n} b_k left( sum_{i=0}^{k} binom{k}{i} s^i (-1)^{k-i} right) = sum_{i=0}^{n} s^i sum_{k=i}^{n} (-1)^{k-i} binom{k}{i} b_k ] 8. Therefore, [ mathrm{E}[s^X] = sum_{i=0}^{n} s^i sum_{k=i}^{n} (-1)^{k-i} binom{k}{i} b_k ] Conclusion: The formula for the probability ( mathrm{P}(X = i) ) or ( p_i ) is: [ p_i = sum_{k=i}^{n} (-1)^{k-i} binom{k}{i} b_k ] (boxed{})"},{"prompt":"Let ngeq 1 be an integer and let a and b be its positive divisors satisfying a+b+ab=n .

The points on l with integral x-coordinates, given l has the equation y = frac{2x}{5}, are: [(0,0), left(1, frac{2}{5}right), left(2, frac{4}{5}right), left(3, 1 + frac{1}{5}right), left(4, 1 + frac{3}{5}right), (5,2).] We observe that between each integral x-coordinate, the line crosses either the boundary of a square or a circle or both due to their sizes and positions. Specifically, each segment intersects with one square centered at the point of form (k, frac{2}{5}k) and one circle. There are frac{803}{5} = frac{323}{2} = 161 such segments. Thus, the count for each segment is 2 (1 square and 1 circle), leading to 161 cdot 2 = 322 intersections. Since the lattice points at (0,0) and (803,323) also contribute one square and one circle each, we add 4 more intersections, making the total 322 + 4 = 326.

First Solution: We will seek f(x) in the form of a linear polynomial, i.e., [ mathbf{f}(x) = d cdot x + e ] Substituting this into the given equation, we get: [ a cdot f(x-1) + b cdot f(1-x) = a cdot [d(x-1) + e] + b cdot [d(1-x) + e] ] Simplifying, we have: [ a cdot [d(x-1) + e] + b cdot [d(1-x) + e] = ad(x-1) + ae + bd(1-x) + be ] [ = adx - ad + ae + bd - bdx + be ] [ = d(ax - a + b - bx) + e(a + b) ] Grouping terms by x, we get: [ d(ax - bx) + e(a + b) = x(a - b)d + (a + b)e ] For this to match the form c cdot x, we need to equate the coefficients: [ begin{aligned} d(a - b) &= c, (a + b)e &= 0 end{aligned} ] Solving for the coefficients d and e: 1.

Now let's consider special cases: 1. **If ( a = b ):** The relationship becomes: [ a cdot [f(x-1) pm f(1-x)] = c cdot x ] By substituting x = 0 and x = 2, we get: [ a cdot [f(-1) pm f(1)] = 0 quad text{and} quad a cdot [f(1) pm f(-1)] = 2c ] This system indicates that c = 0 must hold if a neq 0.

Next, the digits are 6 and 5. For the number to be divisible by 13, the next pair (5 and the following digit) must also form one of the multiples of 13.

For the case of perfect powers, the same argument holds because the p_i-adic valuation of the sum will be 1, which is not divisible by any integer greater than 1, thus preventing the sum from being a perfect power.

According to the given information, ( v_a = frac{21}{19} v_b ). In a race, the time taken to complete the race is the same for both runners if it ends in a dead heat. The time taken to complete the race is given by the distance divided by the speed. Let's denote the length of the race as ( L ) and the head start given to b as ( H ). For a, who runs the entire length of the race, the time taken is ( frac{L}{v_a} ). For b, who gets a head start of ( H ), the time taken is ( frac{L - H}{v_b} ). Since the race ends in a dead heat, the time taken by both runners is the same: [ frac{L}{v_a} = frac{L - H}{v_b} ] Substitute ( v_a ) with ( frac{21}{19} v_b ): [ frac{L}{frac{21}{19} v_b} = frac{L - H}{v_b} ] Simplify the equation: [ frac{19L}{21 v_b} = frac{L - H}{v_b} ] Since ( v_b ) is common in both denominators, we can cancel it out: [ frac{19L}{21} = L - H ] Now, solve for ( H ): [ H = L - frac{19L}{21} ] [ H = L left(1 - frac{19}{21}right) ] [ H = L left(frac{21}{21} - frac{19}{21}right) ] [ H = L left(frac{2}{21}right) ] So, a should give b a head start of ( boxed{frac{2}{21}} ) of the length of the race to ensure the race ends in a dead heat."},{"prompt":"w many line segments in a nonagon join any two vertices that are not adjacent to each other?","completion":"A nonagon has 9 vertices. To find the number of line segments that join any two vertices that are not adjacent, we can use the following approach: First, we calculate the total number of line segments that can be formed by joining any two vertices.

However, this includes the line segments that are the sides of the nonagon, which are adjacent vertices. Since a nonagon has 9 sides, we need to subtract these from the total. 36 (total line segments) - 9 (sides of the nonagon) = 27 Therefore, there are boxed{27} line segments in a nonagon that join any two vertices that are not adjacent to each other."},{"prompt":"Alex has 6 pieces of paper, each with a different math problem.

Let us first denote the given intersecting planes by tau and sigma. 2. Note that the point A is located at the intersection of these two planes tau and sigma. 3. We aim to prove that the line passing through point A, which forms the largest angle with plane sigma, is perpendicular to the line of intersection of planes tau and sigma. To begin this proof, recall that the angle between a line and a plane is the complement of the angle between the line and the projection of the line on the plane. This follows from properties of the dihedral angle formed by the line and the plane. 4. Consider a line AC, which lies in plane tau and passes through the point A. Let AK be the line of intersection of planes tau and sigma, and suppose line AH is perpendicular to plane sigma at point H. According to the definition of the angle between a line and a plane, the angle between AC and sigma needs to be considered. 5. Utilizing the property of a tetrahedral angle (three-dimensional angle), we know: angle CAK geq angle CAH - angle KAH The equality holds if all three edges CA, AH, and AK lie within the same plane, which is exactly the condition in plane geometry. 6. To find the maximum angle of inclination, we observe: The minimum angle between the line passing through point A and the plane sigma will be obtained when AC lies in the plane formed by KAH, pivoting on the concept of dihedral angles. 7. By the properties of perpendiculars to planes, if we chose AH to be the perpendicular from A to plane sigma, then CA in plane tau will make the minimum angle when CA is perpendicular to AK. This line CA maximizes the angle with the plane sigma, because the maximum deviation from sigma will be a right angle minus the smallest angle-- the angle that CA makes with the plane sigma. 8. Therefore, to form the largest angle with plane sigma, the line should be perpendicular to AK, which is the intersection line of planes tau and sigma. # Conclusion: The line passing through point A within plane tau that makes the largest angle with plane sigma is the one perpendicular to the line of intersection of planes tau and sigma.

The task is to determine the maximum number of rooks that can end up in one of the two symmetric halves when the board is divided into two connected parts that are symmetrical to each other relative to the center of the board. 1. **Observations**: Each rook must occupy a unique row and column. 2. **Symmetry Condition**: If we divide the board symmetrically, suppose A, B, C, D represent the corner cells (clockwise starting from the top-left). For a symmetric division: - A and C must belong to different parts. - Similarly, B and D must belong to different parts. 3. **Proof for Maximum 2n - 1 Rooks in One Part**: - Assume that all 2n rooks could be placed in one part.

The sum of the divisors of ( n ) can be expressed as: [ s(n) = prod_{i=1}^k left(1 + p_i + p_i^2 + cdots + p_i^{e_i}right) ] Given that ( n ) is perfect, we have: [ prod_{i=1}^k left(1 + p_i + p_i^2 + cdots + p_i^{e_i}right) = 2n ] 3. **Assumption for contradiction**: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that ( e_1 ) is an odd number. This implies that the sum of the divisors of ( p_1^{e_1} ) is: [ 1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + cdots + p_1^{e_1} ] Since ( e_1 ) is odd, the sum ( 1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + cdots + p_1^{e_1} ) is an odd number. 4. **Divisibility argument**: Notice that ( 1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + cdots + p_1^{e_1} ) must divide ( 2n ). Since ( 2n ) is even, and ( 1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + cdots + p_1^{e_1} ) is odd, it must be that ( 1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + cdots + p_1^{e_1} ) divides ( n ). 5. **Factorization and prime constraints**: Since ( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k} ), and ( 1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + cdots + p_1^{e_1} ) divides ( n ), it must be that ( 1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + cdots + p_1^{e_1} ) is composed of the primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ). 6. **Prime factor ( p_1 + 1 )**: Consider the term ( p_1 + 1 ). Since ( 1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + cdots + p_1^{e_1} ) is odd and divides ( 2n ), ( p_1 + 1 ) must be a factor of ( 2n ). Given that ( p_1 > 1 ), ( p_1 + 1 ) must be a factor of ( n ). 7. **Prime ( p_2 ) constraint**: Since ( p_1 + 1 ) must be a factor of ( n ), and ( p_1 + 1 < p_3, p_4, ldots, p_k ), the only way for ( p_2 ) to divide ( p_1 + 1 ) is if ( p_2 = p_1 + 1 ). This implies ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ) are consecutive primes. 8. **Specific primes**: The only consecutive primes are ( (2, 3) ). Thus, ( p_1 = 2 ) and ( p_2 = 3 ). Since both 2 and 3 are prime factors, ( 6 ) must divide ( n ). 9. **Contradiction**: Consider the inequality: [ s(n) = 2n > n + frac{n}{2} + frac{n}{3} + frac{n}{6} + 1 = 2n + 1 ] This inequality is a contradiction because ( s(n) = 2n ) cannot be greater than ( 2n + 1 ). 10. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our assumption that ( e_1 ) is odd must be false. Hence, ( e_1 ) must be an even number.

Consider MVEM... arrangements continue. Cycle continuation shouldn’t repeat scenarios where forbidden sequences appear (such as VE or EM). Define patterns and use permutations: - Martian at 1, Earthling at 15. - The remaining seats are 2 to 14, which must be filled with 3 Martians, 6 Venusians, and 4 Earthlings (removing one of each for seats 1 and 15.) Break down possible patterns ensuring: - No Martians follow a Venusian directly. - No Venusians follow an Earthling directly. - Respect the new restriction at the start and end positions. Counting arrangements: - Starting at seat 2, a cycle MVEMVE... is one feasible pattern, but watch out at juncture between chair 14 and 15 where a Venusian should not immediately precede chair 15’s Earthling. Using combinatorial counting: - Place remaining Earthlings, considering no direct predecessor issue: 4 Earthlings with one fixed, the positions left are between non-Martian heads. - Permutation calculation for the free sequence, considering the chairs are numbered is a reduced combinatorial problem of 4! times 6! times 3! conforming to specific sequence rules. Calculating specifics with constraints: Computing this exactly requires enumerating acceptable sequences and permutations, especially considering the circular arrangement that complicates direct prefacing. It could be done with sophisticated inclusion-exclusion principles or computationally. Conclusion with boxed answer: Without specific enumerations, the exact solution isn't directly solvable here without further detailed breakdown, which suggests potential computational methods or deeper combinatorial analysis would be needed.

This implies that if they intersect at a point (a,b) where a neq b, they must also intersect at the point (b,a), which is the reflection of (a,b) across the line y = x. However, since it's given that there is exactly one point of intersection, this point must satisfy a = b. Therefore, the point of intersection must be of the form (a,a). Given that the point lies on the graph of y = f(x), we have a = f(a).

The total runs scored after 17 innings can be calculated as the old total plus the new score, which is 16A + 88. The new average (A + 3) is calculated by dividing the new total runs by the number of innings (17). So we have: New Average = (Total Runs after 17 innings) / 17 A + 3 = (16A + 88) / 17 Now, we solve for A: 17A + 51 = 16A + 88 Subtract 16A from both sides: A = 88 - 51 A = 37 So the average after the 16th inning was 37 runs.

The total cost of the chickens is given as Rs.500. The total cost of the goats and pigs combined is given as Rs.4000. Now, let's calculate the individual costs of the goats and pigs using their average prices: The average price of a goat is Rs.120, and there are 5 goats, so the total cost of the goats is: 5 goats * Rs.120/goat = Rs.600 The average price of a pig is Rs.180, and there are 4 pigs, so the total cost of the pigs is: 4 pigs * Rs.180/pig = Rs.720 Now, let's add the total cost of the goats and pigs to find the combined cost: Total cost of goats and pigs = Rs.600 (goats) + Rs.720 (pigs) = Rs.1320 However, we are given that the combined cost of goats and pigs is Rs.4000, which means we have made a mistake in our calculation. Let's correct that. Since the total cost of goats and pigs is Rs.4000, we don't need to calculate it individually. We can use this information directly. Now, let's calculate the total cost of all the animals: Total cost of all animals = Rs.7500 We have the total cost of chickens (Rs.500), goats, and pigs (Rs.4000), so we can find the total cost of the cows by subtracting these from the total cost of all animals: Total cost of cows = Total cost of all animals - (Total cost of chickens + Total cost of goats and pigs) Total cost of cows = Rs.7500 - (Rs.500 + Rs.4000) Total cost of cows = Rs.7500 - Rs.4500 Total cost of cows = Rs.3000 Now, we know there are three cows, so we can find the cost of one cow by dividing the total cost of cows by the number of cows: Cost of one cow = Total cost of cows / Number of cows Cost of one cow = Rs.3000 / 3 cows Cost of one cow = Rs.1000 Therefore, the cost of one cow is boxed{Rs.1000} ."},{"prompt":"At the beginning of an academic year, there were some boys in a class and the number of girls was 20% greater.

Later in the year, the number of girls doubled, so the new number of girls became 2 * 1.20B = 2.40B. Since the number of boys remained the same, the total number of students in the class after the transfer students were admitted is the sum of the number of boys and the new number of girls, which is B + 2.40B = 3.40B.

This line ( l ) is chosen to maximize the property that the napkins to its left are good sets. 3. **Application of Helly's Theorem**: By Helly's theorem, if any finite collection of convex sets in (mathbb{R}^2) has the property that every three of them have a point in common, then the whole collection has a point in common. In our context, this implies that if the green napkins to the left of ( l ) form a good set, then there must be two green napkins whose vertical projections overlap. The same applies to the blue napkins. 4. **Check the napkins to the right of ( l )**: If either the green napkins or the blue napkins strictly to the right of ( l ) form a good set, then we are done. We can choose the color of the napkins that form a good set to the right of ( l ), and the vertical line ( l ) along with any horizontal line that intersects the good set. 5. **Assume no good set to the right of ( l )**: Suppose neither the green nor the blue napkins strictly to the right of ( l ) form a good set. This means there are two green napkins ( L_1 ) and ( L_2 ) to the left of ( l ) whose vertical projections do not intersect, and two blue napkins ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ) to the right of ( l ) whose vertical projections do not intersect. 6. **Define coordinates**: Let ( L_1 ) be above ( L_2 ) and ( R_1 ) be above ( R_2 ).

Similarly, since ( R_2 ) and ( L_1 ) can be intersected by a horizontal line, we have ( r_2 ge l_1 ). This leads to: [ l_2 ge r_1 > r_2 ge l_1 ] This is a contradiction because it implies ( l_2 ge l_1 ), which contradicts ( l_1 > l_2 ). 8. **Conclusion**: The contradiction implies that our assumption that neither the green nor the blue napkins strictly to the right of ( l ) form a good set is false. Therefore, it is possible to choose a color, two horizontal lines, and one vertical line such that each napkin of the chosen color is intersected by at least one of the chosen lines.

This lemma can be proven using induction and modular arithmetic, but we will not delve into the proof here. 2. **Prime Factorization and Valuation**: We need to consider the ( p )-adic valuation ( v_p ) of both sides of the equation for primes ( p ) not dividing ( u ). Specifically, we want ( v_p(n!) = v_p(u^b - 1) ). 3. **Odd Prime Divisors**: Consider an odd prime ( p ) dividing ( u - 1 ). If there is no such prime, consider any odd prime dividing ( u^s - 1 ) for some ( s ). Let ( p^k parallel u^s - 1 ), so ( u^s = ap^k + 1 ) with ( p nmid a ). By the lemma, ( u^s ) has order ( p^{t - k} ) modulo ( p^t ). 4. **Minimal Order**: Choose ( s ) to be minimal such that ( p mid u^s - 1 ). The order of ( u mod p^n ) is ( s cdot p^{t - k} ). 5. **Valuation of Factorials**: The number of multiples of ( p ) in ( n! ) is given by: [ v_p(n!) = leftlfloor frac{n}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{p^3} rightrfloor + cdots ] For large ( n ), this is approximately ( frac{n}{p} ). 6. **Order Condition**: We need ( u^b equiv 1 mod p^{v_p(n!)} ), implying ( b ) must be a multiple of ( p^{v_p(n!) - k} ). 7. **Inequality Derivation**: We derive the inequality: [ n! = u^a(u^b - 1) > u^{p^{v_p(n!) - k}} - 1 > u^{p^{frac{n}{p} - k - 1}} - 1 ] This simplifies to: [ n^n geq u^{p^{frac{n}{p(p - 1)} - k - 1}} ] Taking logarithms, we get: [ n log(n) geq log(u) cdot p^{frac{n}{p(p - 1)} - k - 1} ] Or equivalently: [ log(u)^{-1} n^2 + (k + 1) geq n log(n) geq left( p^{frac{1}{p}} right)^n ] 8. **Polynomial vs. Exponential**: The left side of the inequality is a polynomial in ( n ), while the right side is an exponential function. Since exponential functions grow faster than polynomials, this inequality can only hold for finitely many ( n ).

What is the reduced price per kg of oil?","completion":"Let's denote the original price per kg of oil as P and the reduced price per kg of oil as R. Given that the reduction in price is 30%, we can express the reduced price as: R = P - 0.30P R = 0.70P The housewife is able to obtain 5 kgs more for Rs. 800 after the reduction in price. This means that for Rs. 800, she can now buy the original quantity of oil plus an additional 5 kgs. Let's denote the original quantity of oil she could buy for Rs. 800 as Q kgs. Then, after the reduction, she can buy Q + 5 kgs for the same amount of money. Using the original price, the amount of oil she could buy for Rs. 800 is: 800 / P = Q Using the reduced price, the amount of oil she can now buy for Rs. 800 is: 800 / R = Q + 5 Substituting R with 0.70P, we get: 800 / (0.70P) = Q + 5 Now, we can express Q in terms of P using the first equation: Q = 800 / P Substituting this into the second equation, we get: 800 / (0.70P) = (800 / P) + 5 To solve for P, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 0.70P to get rid of the denominators: 800 = 0.70 * 800 + 5 * 0.70P Simplifying, we get: 800 = 560 + 3.5P Subtracting 560 from both sides, we get: 240 = 3.5P Dividing both sides by 3.5, we get: P = 240 / 3.5 P = 68.57 (approximately) Now that we have the original price per kg (P), we can find the reduced price per kg (R): R = 0.70P R = 0.70 * 68.57 R = 48 (approximately, to the nearest whole number) Therefore, the reduced price per kg of oil is approximately Rs. boxed{48} ."},{"prompt":"w many fourdigit numbers (N) have the property that the threedigit number obtained by removing the leftmost digit is one eighth of (N)?","completion":"Let (a) denote the leftmost digit of (N) and let (x) denote the three-digit number obtained by removing (a).

There is no overlap. The initial error is that the solution incorrectly assumed these inequalities pertain to pure imaginary numbers. In fact, for z to be purely imaginary, the real part should be zero and the imaginary part non-zero. This was already covered in part (2).

Represent each of the (2n) projects as a vertex in a graph. If two projects are chosen by the same contestant, draw an edge between the corresponding vertices. Let (G) be the resulting graph, which is a (2n)-regular graph (each project is selected by exactly two contestants). By the problem's conditions, for any (k in {1,2,cdots,n-1}), no project is chosen by more than (k) contestants out of any group of (k) contestants. This gives us the property (P''): for any (k in {1,2,cdots,n-1}), any subset of (k) vertices in (G) has at most (k-1) vertices of degree more than (k). 1. **Proof by contradiction**: - Assume (G) does not contain a Hamiltonian cycle. - Let (H) be the set of all (2n)-vertex non-Hamiltonian graphs satisfying property (P). - Since (H) is not empty, there is a maximal element (G_0 in H) (i.e., (G_0) has the maximum number of edges among graphs in (H)). 2. **Non-adjacency in (G_0)**: - Since (G_0) is non-Hamiltonian, there are non-adjacent vertices (u) and (v) in (G_0). - By maximization of (G_0), adding edge (uv) to (G_0) creates a Hamiltonian graph, meaning (G_1= G_0 + uv ) has a Hamiltonian cycle containing (uv). - This implies (G_0) must have a Hamiltonian path (v_1v_2 cdots v_{2n}) with (u = v_1) and (v = v_{2n}). 3. **Degree considerations**: - From the construction, at least one of the vertices (u, v) must have a degree not greater than (n-1) because otherwise, by connectivity constraints derived from the path, both would lead to contradictions regarding maximal edges. 4. **Vertex degree analysis**: - Define (E = { v in V(G) mid d(v) leq n-1 }). - Assume there exists (v_1 in E) having maximal degree (m) in (E), (m leq n-1). 5. **Finding contradiction**: - There are at least (n+2) vertices in (G_0) with degrees not less than (n). Among these, there is a vertex that is not adjacent to (v_1). - Construct Hamiltonian paths and identify contradictions between available degrees and (P). 6. **Conclusion**: - As non-adjacency and degree properties in (G_0) contradict assumed bounds on degrees within properties of graph paths, the original assumption that (G) is not Hamiltonian must be false. Hence, (G) actually contains a Hamiltonian cycle, supporting that the (2n) projects can be grouped such that each project is chosen by exactly two contestants. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Jame has 60 bars of gold.

Let this intersection be (O). 3. **Evaluate the distance between the skew lines:** - Define the perpendicular distance (h) between the skew lines (L_1) and (L_2) which intersect at (O) after projection. 4. **Analyze a segment with endpoints on the lines:** - Assume the segment (MN) of length (d), where (M) lies on (L_1) and (N) lies on (L_2). - Since (L_1) and (L_2) are mutually perpendicular lines, (MN) forms a right triangle with the segments (OM) and (ON) such that (OM) and (ON) meet at point (O). 5. **Determine the midpoints of segments:** - The midpoint (P) of the segment (MN) can be expressed as: [ P = left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}, frac{z_1 + z_2}{2}right) ] where ((x_1, y_1, z_1)) are coordinates on (L_1) and ((x_2, y_2, z_2)) are coordinates on (L_2). 6. **Derive the radius of the circle describing midpoints:** - The set of all such midpoints forms a circle in the plane parallel to (L_1) and (L_2) with radius (R) given by: [ R = frac{1}{2}sqrt{d^2 - h^2} ] - This follows from the Pythagorean theorem where (d^2 = l_1^2 + l_2^2 + h^2) and the radius is half of the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by the distances along the skew lines and the perpendicular distance (h). # Conclusion: The geometric locus of the midpoints of line segments of given length (d), whose endpoints lie on two given perpendicular skew lines, is a circle in a plane parallel to the skew lines.

We are required to prove that ( H_{1}H = HH_{0} = H_{0}H_{2} ). 2. **Using Similarity of Triangles**: Since the centers of the inscribed circles are each the point of intersection of the angle bisectors, several triangles within ( triangle ABC ) are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) criterion due to the vertical angle and corresponding angles. 3. **Setting up Coordinates**: Without loss of generality, assume coordinates such that: - ( A = (0, 0) ), ( B = (0, b) ), and ( C = (c, 0) ). 4. **Calculating Projections**: Let’s denote the incenter of ( triangle ABC ) as ( I ), and the incenter of smaller triangles involving the inscribed circles as appropriate points. 5. **Using Known Distance Formula**: The distances ( H_{1}H ), ( HH_{0} ), and ( H_{0}H_{2} ) involve projections onto the hypotenuse ( AC ).

Consider the expression (left(1 + 4 cdot sqrt[3]{2} - 4 cdot sqrt[3]{4} right)^n). We need to expand this expression using the multinomial theorem.

However, since (sqrt[3]{4}) is a distinct term, the only way for its coefficient to be zero is if there are no terms involving (sqrt[3]{4}) at all. This implies (r = 0) for all terms in the expansion. 5. If (r = 0), then (p + q = n). The expression simplifies to: [ left(1 + 4 cdot sqrt[3]{2} right)^n = sum_{p+q=n} frac{n!}{p! q!} 4^q (sqrt[3]{2})^q ] This is a polynomial in (sqrt[3]{2}) and does not involve (sqrt[3]{4}). 6.

Let's identify and understand the given problem: The problem involves a rectanglular parallelepiped inscribed in a sphere of radius ( R ).

We need to find the area of the section formed by a plane passing through diagonal ( AC_1 ) and parallel to the diagonal ( BD ), forming an angle of ( arcsin frac{sqrt{2}}{4} ) with diagonal ( BD_1 ). 2. Begin by determining key geometric properties: Let ( O ) be the center of the sphere which is also the intersection point of the diagonals of the parallelepiped. Since ( O ) is equidistant from all vertices, it is the center. Given that the radius of the sphere is ( R ), the lengths of the diagonals ( A_1C ) and ( BD_1 ) are ( 2R ). 3. Define the base plane (ABCD): The base plane passes through the line ( BD ). Since the plane parallel to diagonal (BD) intersects, the line of intersection (I) is parallel to ( BD ). 4. Determine points of intersection: Let the intersection of the plane with lines ( BC ) and ( CD ) be points ( P ) and ( Q ) respectively. This results in line segment ( PQ ). 5. Analyze the geometry and symmetry: Because ( PB = AD ) (opposite sides in parallelogram ( ADBP )), we can deduce that ( PB = AD ). If lines ( C_1Q ) and ( DD_1 ) meet at point ( N ), and lines ( C_1P ) and ( BB_1 ) meet at point ( M ), the intersection described in the problem forms parallelogram ( AM_1N ). 6.

Area of the square: The area of a square is given by the formula: [ text{Area}_{text{square}} = text{side length}^2 ] Given the side length is 17 m, the area of the square is: [ text{Area}_{text{square}} = 17^2 = 289 text{ m}^2 ] 2. Area of the semicircle: The area of a circle is given by the formula: [ text{Area}_{text{circle}} = pi times text{radius}^2 ] Since we have a semicircle, we will take half of the area of a full circle. The diameter of the semicircle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 17 m.

One by one, every ball is selected at random without replacement. What is the probability that the fourth ball selected is black?","completion":"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of symmetry or we can calculate the probability directly. **Using Symmetry:** Since the balls are selected without replacement, the probability of selecting a black ball on the fourth draw is the same as the probability of selecting a black ball on the first draw. This is because the balls are indistinguishable in terms of probability, and the order in which they are drawn does not matter. Therefore, the probability of drawing a black ball on the fourth draw is the same as the probability of drawing a black ball on any draw. Since there are 4 black balls and 4 red balls, the probability of drawing a black ball on the first draw (or any single draw) is: [ P(text{Black ball}) = frac{text{Number of black balls}}{text{Total number of balls}} = frac{4}{4+4} = frac{4}{8} = frac{1}{2} ] So, the probability that the fourth ball selected is black is (frac{1}{2}) or 50%. **Calculating Directly:** We can also calculate the probability directly by considering all the possible outcomes for the first three draws and then the fourth draw being black. However, this method is more complex and unnecessary in this case because of the symmetry argument. The direct calculation would involve summing the probabilities of all the sequences of three draws that end with a black ball on the fourth draw, but it would ultimately yield the same result of (frac{1}{2}). Therefore, the probability that the fourth ball selected is black is boxed{(frac{1}{2})} or 50%."},{"prompt":"Find the point ( M^{prime} ) symmetric to the point ( M ) with respect to the plane.

Let ( f(x) = x + c ) for some constant ( c ). Substituting ( f(x) = x + c ) back into the original equation, we see that it satisfies: [ x + (y + c) = y + (x + c) implies x + y + c = y + x + c ] Thus, ( f(x) = x + c ) is a valid solution when ( a = 1 ). 3. **Case 2: ( a neq 1 ):** If ( a neq 1 ), then from ( f(0) = af(0) ) and ( f(0) neq 0 ), we must have ( f(0) = 0 ). Setting ( y = 0 ) in the original equation: [ x + f(0) = a(0 + f(x)) implies x = af(x) ] Solving for ( f(x) ), we get: [ f(x) = frac{x}{a} ] Substituting ( f(x) = frac{x}{a} ) back into the original equation: [ x + frac{y}{a} = a left( y + frac{x}{a} right) ] Simplifying, we get: [ x + frac{y}{a} = ay + x ] Rearranging terms, we get: [ frac{y}{a} - ay = 0 implies y left( frac{1}{a} - a right) = 0 ] Since this must hold for all ( y ), we have: [ frac{1}{a} - a = 0 implies a^2 = 1 implies a = pm 1 ] Since we are considering ( a neq 1 ), we have ( a = -1 ). For ( a = -1 ), substituting ( f(x) = -x ) into the original equation: [ x + (-y) = -1(y + (-x)) implies x - y = -y - x ] This holds true, so ( f(x) = -x ) is a valid solution when ( a = -1 ). Conclusion: The only possible values for ( a ) are ( a = 1 ) and ( a = -1 ).

Therefore, N leq 35. 4. **Showing That N = 35 is Achievable:** - Arrange 35 buses to ensure each bus travels along exactly one street per time unit without overlapping: - **Middle Loop:** - Create a central loop (e.g., hexagon or polygon enclosed by 7 streets) and place 7 buses traveling clockwise around this loop. - **Surrounding Loops:** - Surround the central configuration with smaller loops. - Create loops of sizes that accommodate the remaining 28 buses, for instance, surrounding squares (each containing 4 streets and 4 buses). Arrange 7 such squares around the central hexagon or polygon. 5. **Verifying Non-Intersection Constraint:** - Each bus is assigned a unique street at every moment in time. - Ensuring buses only move along edges designed for sequential, non-intersecting movement ensures no two buses share a street. 6. **Demonstrating Symmetry and Correctness:** - By the construction's symmetrical nature, if every bus constantly moves along its prescribed loop and starts from a non-overlapping initial configuration, no bus will ever share a street with another: demonstrating the condition for each street to be traversed by exactly one bus. # Conclusion: [ boxed{35} ]"},{"prompt":"A man sells 10 pencils for a rupee and experiences a certain percentage loss.

Set h(x_0) = 0 to find the critical point of g(x): x_0 = log_{frac{b}{a}}left(-frac{ln(a)}{ln(b)}right). Since h(x) is increasing, g'(x) < 0 for x < x_0 and g'(x) > 0 for x > x_0. Therefore, g(x) decreases on (-infty, x_0) and increases on (x_0, +infty). We observe that: a. If g(x_0) < 0, then for x < log_a 2, g(x) > 0, indicating more than one zero.

Given that the hyperbola has its center at the origin, foci on the x-axis, and eccentricity e=frac{5}{3}, we start with the standard form of the hyperbola equation: [ frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 quad (a > 0, b > 0) ] 2. We know the relationship between a, b, and the eccentricity e is given by: [ e = frac{c}{a} quad text{where} quad c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} ] Given e = frac{5}{3}, we find: [ frac{5}{3} = frac{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a} quad Rightarrow quad sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = frac{5}{3}a ] 3. Squaring both sides of the equation: [ a^2 + b^2 = left(frac{5}{3}aright)^2 = frac{25}{9}a^2 ] Solving for b^2: [ b^2 = frac{25}{9}a^2 - a^2 = frac{25a^2 - 9a^2}{9} = frac{16a^2}{9} ] Hence: [ frac{b}{a} = sqrt{frac{16}{9}} = frac{4}{3} ] Therefore, we can let: [ a^2 = 9lambda quad text{and} quad b^2 = 16lambda quad (lambda > 0) ] So the equation of the hyperbola becomes: [ frac{x^2}{9lambda} - frac{y^2}{16lambda} = 1 ] 4. Given that the hyperbola intersects the line 8x + 2sqrt{7}y - 16 = 0, we substitute this line's equation into that of the hyperbola. 5. For the intersection condition of the hyperbola and the line, we utilize the property that a line intersects a hyperbola if: [ frac{A^2}{a^2} - frac{B^2}{b^2} = C^2 ] where Ax + By + C = 0. Substituting A = 8, B = 2sqrt{7}, and C = -16, into the hyperbola's equations, we get: [ frac{64}{9lambda} - frac{28}{16lambda} = 1 ] 6.

According to Problem 10.29, we have the following inequality: [ p leq frac{3 sqrt{3} R}{2} ] 3. Substituting this result into the sum of sines identity, we get: [ sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma = frac{p}{R} leq frac{frac{3 sqrt{3} R}{2}}{R} = frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2} ] Thus, we have proved that: [ sin alpha + sin beta + sin gamma leq frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2} ] (boxed{frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}}) --- b) Now we address the inequality (cos left(frac{alpha}{2}right) + cos left(frac{beta}{2}right) + cos left(frac{gamma}{2}right) leq frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}). 1.

The sum of (cos left(frac{theta}{2}right)) for the internal angles of the triangle can be bounded similarly by observing the properties of cosine functions for angles up to (pi). 3. Thus, using analogous reasoning and known inequalities for the half-angles, we reach the same upper bound: [ cos left(frac{alpha}{2}right) + cos left(frac{beta}{2}right) + cos left(frac{gamma}{2}right) leq frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2} ] (boxed{frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2}}) --- c) We consider the inequality (operatorname{ctg} alpha + operatorname{ctg} beta + operatorname{ctg} gamma geq sqrt{3}). 1.

The goal is to determine whether it is possible to place nonoverlapping 1 times 4 rectangular tiles such that every square is covered except the central one. **Step 3:** Calculate the total number of squares that needs to be covered (all but the central one). Since 1 square is to be left uncovered, we need to cover: [ 169 - 1 = 168 text{ squares} ] **Step 4:** Understand the properties of the tiles. Each 1 times 4 rectangular tile covers exactly 4 squares. **Step 5:** Calculate the number of 1 times 4 tiles needed to cover 168 squares: [ frac{168}{4} = 42 text{ tiles} ] Thus, 42 tiles are needed to cover 168 squares if every tile is used efficiently and nonoverlappingly. **Step 6:** Now, consider how these tiles would be placed on the board and their interaction with the central square.

Color the squares such that adjacent squares have different colors. For example, color alternate squares black and white. **Step 9:** Each 1 times 4 tile will cover a combination of 2 white and 2 black squares because the chessboard is colored alternatively. **Step 10:** Calculate the distribution of colored squares on the board: [ 13 times 13 = 169 text{ squares} ] Half of these are white and half are black (with one more white square due to the odd dimension): [ 85 text{ white squares and } 84 text{ black squares} ] **Step 11:** Verify placement constraints.

To do this, we split each prime factor's exponent into half: [ sqrt{15!} = sqrt{2^{11} cdot 3^6 cdot 5^3 cdot 7^2 cdot 11^1 cdot 13^1} = 2^{5.5} cdot 3^3 cdot 5^{1.5} cdot 7 cdot sqrt{2^{0.5} cdot 5^{0.5} cdot 11 cdot 13} ] 3. To make a an integer, we take the integer parts of these factors and pull them out: [ a = 2^5 cdot 3^3 cdot 5^1 cdot 7 ] [ = 32 cdot 27 cdot 5 cdot 7 ] [ = 30240 ] 4. The remaining terms under the square root form b: [ b = frac{15!}{a^2} = frac{15!}{(2^5 cdot 3^3 cdot 5 cdot 7)^2} ] [ a^2 = (2^5 cdot 3^3 cdot 5 cdot 7)^2 = 2^{10} cdot 3^6 cdot 5^2 cdot 7^2 ] [ 15! = 2^{11} cdot 3^6 cdot 5^3 cdot 7^2 cdot 11 cdot 13 ] So, [ b = frac{2^{11} cdot 3^6 cdot 5^3 cdot 7^2 cdot 11 cdot 13}{2^{10} cdot 3^6 cdot 5^2 cdot 7^2} = 2 cdot 5 cdot 11 cdot 13 = 1430 ] Thus, [ sqrt{15!} = 30240 cdot sqrt{1430} ] 5. We are required to find the sum of all possible distinct values of ( a cdot b ): [ ab = 30240 times 1430 = 43219200 ] 6. Based on the problem statement, ( ab ) can be written in the form ( q cdot 15! ). We need to calculate ( frac{ab}{15!} ) to find ( q ): [ frac{ab}{15!} = frac{30240 times 1430}{15!} = frac{43219200}{15!} ] 7. Knowing that: [ 15! = 1,307,674,368,000 ] We find: [ q = frac{43219200}{1,307,674,368,000} = frac{1}{30347.75} = 4 ] Hence: [ boxed{4} ]"},{"prompt":"Two females with PPF (Production Possibility Frontier) M=402K.

To solve this problem, we will consider the problem of filling a right angle divided into infinitely many unit squares with natural numbers such that each row and each column contains all natural numbers exactly once. 2. Let's begin with the filling strategy: - Fill the first row with natural numbers in order: 1, 2, 3, ldots. - In each subsequent row, place the smallest possible number that hasn't yet been placed and adheres to the column constraint: it must not repeat in the column. 3. The strategy can be described step-by-step as follows: - ( R_1: 1, 2, 3, 4, ldots ) (first row) - ( R_2 ) onwards, for each cell ((i, j)) in row (i): - Pick the smallest number that is not in the first (j-1) columns and the first (i-1) rows. 4. We need to show that by this method, every natural number ( n ) will appear in the ( k )-th column. 5. For a number ( n ) to appear in the ( k )-th column (C_k): - Suppose ( n ) does not appear in ( C_k ). - This implies ( n ) must have appeared in the first ( k-1 ) columns in some row. - In the worst case, ( n ) appears in one row of each of the first ( k-1 ) columns, i.e., ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{k-1} ). - However, since there are infinite rows and we have a new row each time, this would contradict the inability to place ( n ) eventually in ( C_k ) because the opportunity is endless. 6.

To determine the relationship between the two circles, we calculate the distance between their centers, |C_{1}C_{2}|, and compare it with their radii, r_{1} and r_{2}. 1. **Distance between centers**: [|C_{1}C_{2}| = sqrt{(2-0)^{2} + (b-0)^{2}} = sqrt{4+b^{2}}] 2. **Radius differences and sums**: [r_{1} - r_{2} = 4 - 2 = 2] [r_{1} + r_{2} = 4 + 2 = 6] **Option A**: For b=1, we find |C_{1}C_{2}| = sqrt{4+1} = sqrt{5}.

Thus, option A is correct. **Option B**: Since |C_{1}C_{2}| = sqrt{4+b^{2}} geq 2 = r_{1} - r_{2} for any b in mathbb{R}, there exists a value of b for which the two circles are externally tangent. This is because the minimum distance for tangency is when |C_{1}C_{2}| = r_{1} - r_{2}. Thus, option B is correct. **Option C**: The two circles cannot be contained within each other because the minimum distance between their centers is 2 (when b=0), which is not enough for one circle to completely contain the other given their radii. Thus, option C is incorrect. **Option D**: For circle C_{2} to bisect the circumference of circle C_{1}, the line containing their common chord would need to pass through the center of C_{1}, (2,b). The equation for this line is 4x+2by-b^{2}+8=0. Substituting (2,b) into this equation gives 8+2b^{2}-b^{2}+8=0, which simplifies to 16+b^{2}=0.

After a time x, the positions of A and B will be: [ A text{ at } (a - v x) ] [ B text{ at } (b - v_{1} x) ] 2. **Distance Between A and B Over Time:** - The distance squared between the points A and B at any time x is given by: [ y^2 = (a - v x)^2 + (b - v_{1} x)^2 ] 3. **Expression for ( y^2 ) in Terms of ( x ):** - Expanding and simplifying the expression: [ y^2 = (a - v x)^2 + (b - v_{1} x)^2 ] [ y^2 = a^2 - 2avx + v^2x^2 + b^2 - 2bv_{1} x + v_{1}^2 x^2 ] [ y^2 = (v^2 + v_{1}^2)x^2 - 2(av + bv_{1}) x + a^2 + b^2 ] 4. **Finding the Minimum of ( y ):** - This quadratic expression achieves its minimum when the derivative with respect to ( x ) is zero: [ frac{d}{dx}left[(v^2 + v_{1}^2)x^2 - 2(av + bv_{1}) x + a^2 + b^2right] = 0 ] [ 2(v^2 + v_{1}^2)x - 2(av + bv_{1}) = 0 ] [ x = frac{av + bv_{1}}{v^2 + v_{1}^2} ] 5. **Calculating the Minimum Distance:** - Substitute ( x = frac{av + bv_{1}}{v^2 + v_{1}^2} ) back into the distance formula: [ y_m^2 = (v^2 + v_{1}^2)left(frac{av + bv_{1}}{v^2 + v_{1}^2}right)^2 - 2(av + bv_{1})left(frac{av + bv_{1}}{v^2 + v_{1}^2}right) + a^2 + b^2 ] - After simplifying: [ y_m^2 = a^2 + b^2 - frac{(av + bv_{1})^2}{v^2 + v_{1}^2} ] [ y_m = frac{|bv - av_{1}|}{sqrt{v^2 + v_{1}^2}} ] Now we have the minimum distance between points A and B: [ boxed{y_m = frac{|bv - av_{1}|}{sqrt{v^2 + v_{1}^2}}} ] Part 2: Distances of Points A and B from the Vertex When They are Closest 1. When they are closest, the distances of A and B from the vertex are: [ A text{ distance from vertex} = a - v left(frac{av + bv_{1}}{v^2 + v_{1}^2}right) = a - frac{a v^2 + a b v v_{1}}{v^2 + v_{1}^2} = left(frac{a v_{1}}{v^2 + v_{1}^2}right) b v ] [ B text{ distance from vertex} = b - v_{1} left(frac{a v + b v_1}{v^2 + v_{1}^2}right) = b - frac{a v v_{1} + b v_{1}^2}{v^2 + v_{1}^2} = left(frac{a v_{1}}{v^2 + v_{1}^2}right) - a v ] Putting it together: [ boxed{vert A text{ distance } - B text{ distance from vertex}vert =frac{a v^2 + a b v v_{1}}{v^2 + v_{1}^2}} ] Part 3: Special Case Where ( v = v_{1} ) 1. **Minimum Distance When ( v = v_{1} ):** - Using the general formulas with ( v = v_{1} = v ): [ y_m = frac{|a v - b v|}{sqrt{v^2 + v^2}} = frac{|a - b|v}{sqrt{2v^2}} = frac{|a - b|}{sqrt{2}} ] 2. **Time When They Are Closest:** - Substitute ( v = v_{1} ) into the ( x ) formula: [ x = frac{av + bv}{v^2 + v^2} = frac{a + b}{2v} ] 3. **Distances from the Vertex:** - For point A: [ d_A = a - v left(frac{a+b}{2v}right) = frac{a - b}{2} ] - For point B: [ d_B = b - v left(frac{a+b}{2v}right) = frac{b - a}{2} ] Thus, we obtain: [ boxed{frac{|a - b|}{sqrt{2}}, frac{a + b}{2v}, frac{|a - b|}{2}, -frac{|a - b|}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, A=60^{circ}, a=4 sqrt {3}, b=4 sqrt {2}, find B, C and c.","completion":"By the Law of Sines, frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B}, We have frac{4 sqrt {3}}{sin 60^{circ} } = frac{4 sqrt {2}}{sin B}, Solving for sin B, we get sin B = frac{sqrt {2}}{2}.

What is the bus driver's regular rate per hour?","completion":"Let's denote the bus driver's regular hourly rate as R. For the first 40 hours, the bus driver is paid at the regular rate, so the total pay for these hours is 40R. For the overtime hours (hours worked beyond 40), the bus driver is paid at a rate that is 75% higher than the regular rate. This means the overtime rate is R + 0.75R = 1.75R. The bus driver worked 60 hours, so the overtime hours are 60 - 40 = 20 hours. The total pay for the overtime hours is 20 hours * 1.75R. The total compensation for the week is the sum of the pay for the regular hours and the overtime hours, which is 1200. So we have: 40R (regular hours pay) + 20 * 1.75R (overtime hours pay) = 1200 Now we can solve for R: 40R + 35R = 1200 75R = 1200 R = 1200 / 75 R = 16 The bus driver's regular rate per hour is boxed{16} ."},{"prompt":"A line with slope 4 intersects a line with slope 3 at the point (8,20).

Given that ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB parallel CD, and points P and Q are on sides AB and CD respectively such that frac{AP}{PB} = frac{DQ}{CQ}. 2. Let M be the intersection of AQ and DP, and N be the intersection of PC and QB. 3. We need to find the length of MN in terms of AB and CD. First, we note that triangle AMP sim triangle QMD and triangle BNP sim triangle QNC by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. This is because: - angle AMP = angle QMD (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD) - angle MAP = angle QDM (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD) Similarly, for triangle BNP sim triangle QNC: - angle BNP = angle QNC (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD) - angle BPN = angle QCN (corresponding angles since AB parallel CD) 4. From the similarity of triangles, we have: [ frac{PM}{MD} = frac{AP}{DQ} = frac{PB}{QC} = frac{PN}{NC} ] 5. This implies that overleftrightarrow{MN} parallel overleftrightarrow{CD} because the ratios of the corresponding segments are equal. 6. To find the length of MN, we use the fact that MN is a segment parallel to CD and divides the trapezoid ABCD proportionally. Therefore: [ MN = frac{PM}{PD} cdot CD ] 7. Since frac{PM}{MD} = frac{AP}{DQ}, we can write: [ frac{PM}{PD} = frac{AP}{AP + DQ} ] 8. Given frac{AP}{PB} = frac{DQ}{CQ}, let AP = k cdot PB and DQ = k cdot CQ for some constant k. Then: [ AP = k cdot PB quad text{and} quad DQ = k cdot CQ ] 9. Since AB = AP + PB and CD = DQ + CQ, we have: [ AP = frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB quad text{and} quad DQ = frac{k}{1+k} cdot CD ] 10. Substituting these into the expression for MN: [ MN = frac{AP}{AP + DQ} cdot CD = frac{frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB}{frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB + frac{k}{1+k} cdot CD} cdot CD ] 11. Simplifying the expression: [ MN = frac{frac{k}{1+k} cdot AB}{frac{k}{1+k} cdot (AB + CD)} cdot CD = frac{AB}{AB + CD} cdot CD ] 12.

So, Jim runs ( 9 times frac{1}{3} = 3 ) miles in 20 minutes. Since Bob had a 1 mile head-start, the distance that Bob runs in the same time is 2 miles (because Jim had to cover the 1 mile head-start plus the distance Bob ran in 20 minutes to catch up to him).

Let (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}) be the roots. 2. **Rational Roots Condition**: If (x) is rational, then (sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}) must also be rational. To be more specific, (sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}) must be an integer because the rational root theorem asserts that if a number (like (sqrt{b^2 - 4ac})) is rational, its value can be expressed as a simplified fraction which is an integer. 3. **Squared Approach**: Let (sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} = d) where (d) is an integer, then we have: [ b^2 - 4ac = d^2 ] 4. **Nature of (d)**: Since (b) is odd, (b^2) is also odd (since the square of an odd number is always odd). (4ac) is clearly even (since it contains the factor 4). Therefore, (b^2 - 4ac) is an odd number (difference of an odd and an even number is odd), which implies that (d^2) is also an odd number. Consequently, (d) must be odd (since the square of an odd number is odd). 5. **Express (d)**: Let (d = b - 2d') for some integer (d') (since (d) is an adjustment of (b) by an even number). 6. **Next Step**: Substitute back into the equation: [ b^2 - 4ac = (b - 2d')^2 ] 7. **Simplification**: [ b^2 - 4ac = b^2 - 4bd' + 4d'^2 ] [ -4ac = -4bd' + 4d'^2 ] [ ac = bd' - d'^2 ] 8. **Contradiction**: On the left side, (ac) is a product of two odd numbers, hence (ac) is odd. On the right side, (bd' - d'^2) will either be odd or even, depending on whether (d') itself is odd or even: - If (d') is even, (bd') is even while (d'^2) is even, making their difference even. - If (d') is odd, (bd') (product of two odd numbers) is odd, (d'^2) is also odd, making their difference even. In both cases, the right side is even, while the left side is odd, which is a contradiction. Thus, it is impossible for (b^2 - 4ac) to be a perfect square, so it cannot be an integer. This invalidates our assumption that the roots are rational.

The term (ap^2) is odd (since (a) is odd), (bpq) is odd (product of 3 odd numbers), and (cq^2) is odd. - The sum of odd numbers is odd, making (ap^2 + bpq + cq^2) odd. This contradicts the left side being 0 which is even. - If one of (p) or (q) is even and the other is odd: - Without loss of generality, assume (p) is odd and (q) is even. - Then, (ap^2) is odd (since (a) and (p^2) are odd), (bpq) is even (product of odd and even numbers is even), and (cq^2) is even (since even number squared is even). In this case, the sum contains an odd term ((ap^2)) and two even terms ((bpq) and (cq^2)), resulting in an overall term that is odd. This again contradicts the left side being 0 (even). Therefore, (p) and (q) cannot both be odds, one even and the other odd. Both (p) and (q) being even is also not possible since the fraction (frac{p}{q}) would not be in simplest form.

(b) Does anyone have a winning strategy?","completion":"**Part (a):** 1. **Representation of the Cards**: We start by representing the sequence of 2009 cards using a binary system: - A card with its blue side up is represented by the digit 1. - A card with its yellow side up is represented by the digit 0. 2. **Effect of a Move:** Since a move consists of flipping a block of 50 cards, where the first card of the block must be blue (represented by 1), the leftmost flipped card (which is 1) will become 0. 3. **Sequence of Numbers:** Therefore, every move decreases the numerical value of the binary number (a single 1 turns into a 0). This is an example of a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers since each flip reduces the binary integer. 4. **Termination Condition:** A strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers must eventually reach 0. Thus, the game will end when all cards show their yellow side (binary representation is 0). **Conclusion for (a):** The game must necessarily terminate.

There are ( frac{2000}{50} = 40 ) such key cards. 2. **Parity Analysis**: During each move: - A block of 50 cards is flipped. - Each move flips exactly one of these key cards. 3. **Initial Parity**: Initially, all key cards are blue (i.e., 1). 4. **Pattern of Moves**: - Since each move affects one and only one of the key cards, moves alternate the parity of the number of key cards face-up. 5. **Winning Strategy for the Second Player**: - The first player's move by flipping a block always leaves an odd number of these key cards blue. - The second player (playing next) thus faces an odd number of blue key cards. - Consequently, the second player always has at least one valid move (a block beginning with a blue side showing). **Conclusion for (b):** The second player is guaranteed to win because the first player always leaves him a scenario where he can make a move.

Suppose (ell leq a + b). 2. **Define sets (W) and (L)**: - Let (W) be the set of indices of vertices that (v_ell) wins against. Since (v_ell) wins against at least (a) players, (|W| geq a). - Let (L) be the set of indices of vertices that (v_1) loses to. Since (v_1) loses to at least (b) players, (|L| geq b). 3. **Constraints on (W) and (L)**: Notice that (W) and (L) must be subsets of ({2, 3, ldots, ell-1}) because (v_1) and (v_ell) are the endpoints of the path. Therefore, (W, L subseteq {2, 3, ldots, ell-1}). 4. **Define sets (W') and (L')**: - Define (W' = {x-1 mid x in W, x leq max L}). - Define (L' = {x+1 mid x in L, x geq min W}). 5. **Intersection of (W') and (L')**: Since (|W| geq a) and (|L| geq b), and considering the constraints on the indices, the sets (W') and (L') must intersect. This is because the total number of indices in ({2, 3, ldots, ell-1}) is (ell-2), and (ell leq a + b). Therefore, (|W| + |L| geq a + b), which forces (W') and (L') to have a non-empty intersection. 6. **Existence of a common vertex**: Let (v_x) be a vertex in the intersection (W' cap L'). This means (v_x) can be reordered to be either the first or the last vertex in the path. All of (v_x)'s wins and losses must occur within the path, implying that the path must have at least (a + b) other vertices. 7. **Conclusion**: Since (ell leq a + b) leads to a contradiction, the length of the longest path must be at least (a + b + 1). Therefore, there exist (a + b + 1) distinct players (Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_{a+b+1}) such that (Q_i) wins against (Q_{i+1}) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, a + b).

Tanya chooses a natural number ( n ) and places different natural numbers in the circles so that the following property holds for all these numbers: If numbers ( a ) and ( b ) are not connected by a segment, then the sum ( a^2 + b^2 ) must be coprime with ( n ). If they are connected, then the numbers ( a^2 + b^2 ) and ( n ) must have a common natural divisor greater than 1. What is the smallest ( n ) for which such an arrangement exists?","completion":"First, let's state the problem clearly. We need to find the smallest natural number n such that we can arrange natural numbers in circles on a graph with the following properties: 1. If two numbers a and b are not connected by a line segment, the sum of their squares a^2 + b^2 must be coprime with n . 2. If two numbers a and b are connected, then a^2 + b^2 and n must have a common divisor greater than 1. Step-by-step solution: 1. **Observation 1:** - n must be odd. Suppose n is even. Among the six natural numbers, there will always be at least three numbers of the same parity (odd or even). According to the condition, these numbers must be pairwise connected. However, in the given diagram, there are no cycles of length 3, which implies n must be odd. 2. **Observation 2:** - If d is a divisor of n , then at most two numbers can be divisible by d . Suppose there are three numbers divisible by d . Then, these numbers must be pairwise connected and form a cycle of length 3, which contradicts the diagram's structure. 3. **Observation 3:** - If q is a prime divisor of n and in the chain (a, b, c, d) of consecutively connected numbers, the sum of squares of any pair of adjacent numbers is divisible by q , then (a, b, c, d) forms a cycle. Indeed, [ a^2 + d^2 = (a^2 + b^2) - (b^2 + c^2) + (c^2 + d^2) pmod{q} ] This implies that a and d are also connected. Using Observations 1 and 3, it follows that n must have at least two different odd prime divisors. Let's say it has exactly two (for example, p and q ). We will show they are different from 3, 7, and 11. 4. **Further observations on divisors 3, 7, and 11:** - For any natural a , [ a^2 equiv 0 text{ or } 1 pmod{3}, quad a^2 equiv 0, 1, 2, 4 pmod{7}, quad a^2 equiv 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 pmod{11} ] Hence, a^2 + b^2 is divisible by p if and only if both a and b are divisible by p . According to Observation 2, only one pair can satisfy this condition, creating a contradiction if arranged otherwise. Using these facts, if n has exactly two different odd prime divisors, then [ n geq 5 cdot 13 = 65 ] 5. **Verification:** - If n has more than two different prime divisors, then [ n geq 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 105 > 65 ] Therefore, the minimal n is 65. The arrangement for n = 65 is provided in the given diagram. # Conclusion: The smallest value of n for which such an arrangement is possible is boxed{65} ."},{"prompt":"There are 90 students who have lunch during period 5.

The largest odd integer squared less than 20,000 is 139^2 (since 141 is odd but 141^2 = 19881 is within the range, we consider 139).

In a convex quadrilateral where both diagonals bisect internal angles equally, geometric symmetry must imply that these diagonals are equal. 5. **Connecting relationships and symmetries**: Since (N) and (L) are midpoints and line (NL) makes equal angles with diagonals (AC) and (BD), we leverage that: ( angle NLM = angle LNM Rightarrow LM = MN. ) Consequently, using the property of the bisectors in a symmetric manner: [ boxed{AC = BD.} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the complex number z satisfies iz = 1 i, find the conjugate of z.","completion":"Since iz = 1 - i, multiplying both sides by -i gives us the following: begin{align*} -i cdot (iz) &= -i cdot (1 - i) - i^2 cdot z &= -i + 1 quad text{(since } i^2 = -1text{)} z &= -i + 1. end{align*} To find the conjugate overline{z}, we need to change the sign of the imaginary part of z: boxed{overline{z} = overline{-i + 1} = -(-i) + 1 = 1 + i}.

Notably, the difference of two integers maintains the same parity as their sum. Therefore, if we repeatedly replace two numbers with their difference, the parity of the sum of all numbers on the tableau remains unchanged. 3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: - We initially have integers from 1 to 2011. - The sum of these integers is given by the formula for the sum of the first n integers: [ S = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] Setting (n = 2011), we get: [ S = frac{2011 times 2012}{2} = frac{2011 times 2012}{2} ] Since (2012 = 2 times 1006), the sum simplifies to: [ S = 2011 times 1006 ] 4. **Parity of the Initial Sum**: The product of an odd number (2011) and an even number (1006) is even. Thus, the initial sum (S) is even. 5. **Invariant Verification**: Given the sum remains even throughout the process (due to parity preservation), the final integer, being the sole survivor of the iterative process, should also be even. 6. **Conclusion**: Since 1 is an odd number, it is impossible for the last integer obtained to be 1.

We start by finding when the expression is undefined and when the numerator equals zero, which affect the sign of the function: 1. The denominator ( (x-2)^2 = 0 ) when ( x = 2 ). Hence, the function is undefined at ( x = 2 ). 2. The numerator ( x^3 - 1 = 0 ) can be factored as ((x-1)(x^2+x+1) = 0). The real root of this equation is ( x = 1 ), and (x^2 + x + 1 = 0) has no real solutions (as its discriminant (1 - 4 times 1 times 1 = -3 < 0)). Now, considering the intervals defined by these critical points: - **Interval ( (-infty, 1) )**: Plug ( x = 0 ) (a point in this interval), we get (frac{-1}{4} ge 0), which is false. - **Interval ( (1, 2) )**: Plug ( x = 1.5 ) (a point in this interval), we get (frac{0.375}{0.25} ge 0), which is true since both numerator and denominator are positive. - **Interval ( (2, infty) )**: Plug ( x = 3 ) (a point in this interval), we get (frac{26}{1} ge 0), which is true as well.

We substitute 4 for c: 2h + 4 = 36 2h = 32 h = 16 This will be the configuration if we consider only composite numbers starting from the smallest composite. Using a composite number ensures a different challenge compared to using a prime number. Verification and Conclusion: The setting of h = 16 and c = 4 with p = 20 checks out as: p + h = 20 + 16 = 36 And meets the condition boxed{16} being a reasonable maximum for hardcover books with composite difference."},{"prompt":"Grace's age is 3/8th the age of her grandmother.

Thus, ( f ) would map to each element of ( { 0, 1, 2, ldots, N-1 } ) exactly once. - By the pigeonhole principle, if ( f ) is not injective, there exist distinct ( (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n) ) and ( (c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n) ) in ( X ) such that [ f(b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n) = f(c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n) ] - This implies that [ a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + cdots + a_n b_n equiv a_1 c_1 + a_2 c_2 + cdots + a_n c_n mod N ] - Consequently, [ a_1 (b_1 - c_1) + a_2 (b_2 - c_2) + cdots + a_n (b_n - c_n) equiv 0 mod N ] - Setting ( e_i = b_i - c_i ) gives us ( lvert e_i rvert < m ) and not all ( e_i ) are zero. 4. **Contradiction if ( f ) is Injective:** - Assume ( f ) is injective, implying ( { f(B) mid B in X } = { 0, 1, 2, ldots, N-1 } ). - Let ( w ) be a primitive ( N )-th root of unity. By definition, [ sum_{k=0}^{N-1} w^k = 0 ] - Consider the sum [ sum_{B in X} w^{f(B)} ] - If we sum over all residues mod ( N ), we would get [ sum_{k=0}^{N-1} w^k = 0 ] - Alternatively, we can express this sum as the product of sums over each coordinate: [ prod_{i=1}^n left( sum_{j=0}^{m-1} w^{a_i j} right) ] 5. **Simplification of the Product:** - The inner sum can be rewritten using the geometric series formula: [ sum_{j=0}^{m-1} w^{a_i j} = frac{1 - w^{a_i m}}{1 - w^{a_i}} ] - Since ( a_i ) is not a multiple of ( m^{n-1} ), ( a_i m ) is not a multiple of ( N ). Thus, ( w^{a_i m} neq 1 ), ensuring that each term in the product ( frac{1 - w^{a_i m}}{1 - w^{a_i}} ) is nonzero. 6. **Deriving the Contradiction:** - The product of non-zero terms cannot be zero. Therefore, [ prod_{i=1}^n left( frac{1 - w^{a_i m}}{1 - w^{a_i}} right) neq 0 ] - This contradicts the assumption that ( sum_{B in X} w^{f(B)} = 0 ). 7. **Conclusion:** - The contradiction implies that ( f ) cannot be injective.

The discriminant Delta is given by the formula Delta = b^{2} - 4ac. For a quadratic equation to have no real roots, the discriminant must be less than zero, Delta < 0. Given the equation x^{2} + 2x + c = 0, we identify a = 1, b = 2, and c as the constant we are solving for.

Prove that a circle can be inscribed in this quadrilateral.","completion":"1. **Problem Description:** We need to prove that a circle that cuts equal chords on the sides of a quadrilateral can be inscribed in that quadrilateral. 2. **Definitions and Notation:** Let ( O ) be the center of the given circle, ( R ) be its radius, and ( 2a ) be the length of each chord cut by the circle on the sides of the quadrilateral. 3. **Distance from Center ( O ) to the Sides:** The problem states that the quadrilateral's sides are intercepted by equal chords. The square of the distance from the point ( O ) to any side of the quadrilateral can be represented as ( R^2 - a^2 ). Let's derive this step-by-step: - Consider one of the sides of the quadrilateral, say ( AB ). - Suppose the chord ( CD ) is perpendicular to ( AB ) and intersects ( AB ) at ( M ) such that ( M ) is the midpoint of the chord ( CD ). - The segment ( OM ) is the perpendicular distance from the center ( O ) to the chord ( CD ). 4. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:** In the right triangle ( OMC ), where ( OM ) is perpendicular to ( CD ), we have: [ OC^2 = OM^2 + MC^2 ] Since ( OM ) is the distance from the center ( O ) to the side and ( MC = a ) (half of the chord length): [ R^2 = d^2 + a^2 quad text{where} , d = OM ] Solving for ( d ), the distance from the center ( O ) to the side is: [ d^2 = R^2 - a^2 ] 5. **Conclusion:** Since ( d ), the distance from the center ( O ) to each side of the quadrilateral, is equal for all sides as ( d^2 = R^2 - a^2 ), the circle is equidistant from all sides of the quadrilateral.

When frac{1}{e} < x < 1, g'(x) > 0, so g(x) increases monotonically in left(frac{1}{e}, 1right). When 1 < x < e, g'(x) < 0, so g(x) decreases monotonically in (1, e). Since g(1) = 1, gleft(frac{1}{e}right) = e, and g(e) = frac{2}{e}, the range of g(x) is [0, 1]. Therefore, the range of a is boxed{[0, 1]}. (3) For any x in [1, +infty), f(x) geq fleft(frac{1}{x}right) must hold true. This means ax - ln(x) geq frac{a}{x} + ln(x), simplifying to aleft(x - frac{1}{x}right) - 2ln(x) geq 0. Let h(x) = aleft(x - frac{1}{x}right) - 2ln(x). Its derivative is h'(x) = aleft(1 + frac{1}{x^2}right) - frac{2}{x}. When a geq 1, h'(x) geq 0, since h'(x) geq 0 means h(x) is monotonically increasing on [1, +infty), we have h(x) geq h(1) = 0 for all x in [1, +infty). Hence, a geq 1 is a part of the solution. For 0 < a < 1, if x in [1, frac{1}{a}], then a x^2 - 2x + a < 0, which in turn gives h'(x) < 0, and thus h(x) is monotonically decreasing on [1, frac{1}{a}]. Consequently, hleft(frac{1}{a}right) < h(1) = 0, which means there exists an x = frac{1}{a} > 1 such that h(x) < 0, so the condition is not satisfied for 0 < a < 1. For a leq 0, since x geq 1, h'(x) < 0 and h(x) is monotonically decreasing on [1, +infty). Thus, for x > 1, we have h(x) < h(1) = 0, so a leq 0 does not satisfy the condition either. Taking all of this into account, the range of a is boxed{[1, +infty)}."},{"prompt":"Cut a triangle into three parts that can be assembled into a rectangle.","completion":"1.

This divides the triangle into two right-angled triangles: ( triangle ABD ) and ( triangle ACD ). b. Next, draw another line segment from vertex ( B ) perpendicular to segment ( AD ). Let this point intersect ( AD ) at point ( E ). This line will further divide ( triangle ABD ) into two right-angled triangles, specifically ( triangle ABE ) and ( triangle EBD ). c. Similarly, draw a line segment from vertex ( C ) perpendicular to segment ( AD ) at point ( F ). This line will divide ( triangle ACD ) into two right-angled triangles ( triangle ACF ) and ( triangle CFD ).

By definition, (arg z) represents the angle that the complex number (z) makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane. Therefore, (arg z = a) represents a specific ray, or line, originating from the origin and making an angle (a) with the positive real axis. 2. **Calculate (arg(z^2))**: For a complex number (z) with (arg z = a), we square (z), and the argument of (z^2) becomes: [ arg(z^2) = 2 arg(z) = 2a ] This follows from the property of arguments in complex numbers that (arg(z^n) = n cdot arg(z)) for any integer (n). 3. **Calculate (overline{z^2})**: When considering the conjugate (overline{z^2}), we need to understand how the argument is affected.

Let 2a^2 = 16 and 2b^2 = 20. The distance between the foci, |F_1F_2|, is given by sqrt{2a^2 + 2b^2} = sqrt{16+20} = sqrt{36} = 6. Since the hyperbola is horizontally oriented, the foci are 6 units apart both sides from the center, hence |F_1F_2| = 2 cdot 6 = 12.

The focal distance of the parabola, which is the distance from the vertex to the focus (or from the vertex to the directrix), is given by frac{p}{2}. Given that the equation of the directrix is y=3, it means that the focal distance is 3 units away from the vertex along the y-axis. Thus, frac{p}{2}=3. Solving for p, we get: 2p=6. Thus, p=6. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is: x^2=2py. Upon substituting p=6 into the equation, we get: x^2=2(6)y, Simplify it to: x^2=12y.

Specifically, if grasshopper ( A ) jumps over grasshopper ( B ), then after the jump, ( A ) is at the same distance from ( B ) as before, and of course, on the same line. Can one of them land on the fourth vertex of the square?","completion":"1. **Setting up the Coordinate System:** Let's set up a coordinate system on the plane such that the vertices of the original square have coordinates ((0,0)), ((1,0)),((0,1)), and ((1,1)). Assume the grasshoppers initially occupy the vertices ((0,0)), ((1,0)), and ((0,1)). 2. **Understanding the Movement:** When a grasshopper (A) jumps over a grasshopper (B), the coordinates of (A) move to the point where it is at the same relative distance from (B) but on the opposite side. Formally, if (A) is at ((x_1, y_1)) and (B) is at ((x_2, y_2)), after the jump (A)'s new coordinates will be: [ (x_3, y_3) = (2x_2 - x_1, 2y_2 - y_1) ] 3. **Property of Coordinates on the Grid:** Notice that the vertices of the square have integer coordinates. Each jump causes a grasshopper to move to another point with integer coordinates because the calculation for the new coordinates ( (2x_2 - x_1, 2y_2 - y_1) ) always results in integers if ((x_1, y_1)) and ((x_2, y_2)) are integers. 4. **Effect on Parity of Coordinates:** Observe that grasshoppers, starting from ((0,0)), ((1,0)), and ((0,1)), each have at least one coordinate that is even. Each jump, being a symmetric move relative to another grasshopper, preserves the parity of coordinates. Thus, coordinates that are initially even remain even, and those that are initially odd remain odd. 5. **Verification Using Parity:** The coordinates of the fourth vertex ((1,1)) are both odd. Given that grasshoppers can only move to points that preserve the parity of their coordinates, this means that a move from either ((0,0)), ((1,0)), or ((0,1)), none of which initially have both coordinates odd, cannot result in all coordinates flipping simultaneously to odd. 6. **Conclusion:** Thus, based on the preservation of coordinate parity through the symmetric jumping process, it is impossible for any of the grasshoppers to end up at the point ((1,1)).

Is it always possible to find a group of 4 clans, each of which is in conflict with every other clan in the group? To determine whether there is always a group of 4 clans that are mutually antagonistic (each clan in the group is in conflict with every other clan in the group), we can utilize the properties of graph theory. 1. **Restate the Problem in Graph-Theoretical Terms**: - Represent each clan as a vertex in a graph. - Draw an edge between two vertices if the corresponding clans are in conflict. - We need to demonstrate whether this graph must always contain a complete subgraph K_4 (i.e., a set of 4 vertices each connected to each other). 2. **Analyze Degree of Vertices**: - According to the problem, each clan is in conflict with at least 14 other clans. - In graph terminology, each vertex has a degree of at least 14. 3. **Apply Turán's Theorem**: - Turán’s theorem states that if a graph has ( n ) vertices and more than [ left(1 - frac{1}{k-1}right) frac{n^2}{2} ] edges, then it must contain a complete subgraph ( K_k ). - Here, ( k = 4 ) and ( n = 20 ). - Substitute these values into the Turán’s theorem inequality: [ e > left(1 - frac{1}{3}right) frac{20^2}{2} = frac{2}{3} cdot 200 = frac{400}{3} approx 133.33 ] Therefore, if our graph has more than 133 edges, it must contain a ( K_4 ). 4. **Calculate the Minimum Number of Edges**: - Each vertex has a degree of at least 14. - The sum of the degrees of all vertices is at least ( 20 times 14 = 280 ), considering each edge is counted twice, so the number of edges ( e ) is given by: [ 2e geq 280 implies e geq 140 ] - The number of edges is 140 which is greater than 133.33. 5. **Conclusion**: - By Turán's theorem, a graph with 20 vertices and at least 140 edges must contain a complete subgraph ( K_4 ). - Hence, there is definitely a set of 4 clans, each in conflict with each other.

First, let's find the rate at which each worker can load the truck per hour: - The first worker can load 1 truck in 5 hours, so their rate is 1/5 of a truck per hour. - The second worker can load 1 truck in 8 hours, so their rate is 1/8 of a truck per hour. - The third worker can load 1 truck in 10 hours, so their rate is 1/10 of a truck per hour. Now, let's add these rates together to find the combined rate: Combined rate = (1/5) + (1/8) + (1/10) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The smallest common multiple of 5, 8, and 10 is 40.

To find out how long it will take them to load one truck, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate: Time = 1 / (17/40) Multiplying by the reciprocal of 17/40, we get: Time = 1 * (40/17) Time = 40/17 Time ≈ 2.35 hours So, it will take approximately boxed{2.35} hours for all three workers to load one truck simultaneously."},{"prompt":"A certain psychologist charges 30 more for the first hour of therapy than for each additional hour.

Similarly, the probability that Company B answers 1 out of 3 questions correctly is C_{3}^{1} cdot {left(frac{2}{3}right)}^{1} cdot {left(1-frac{2}{3}right)}^{2}, because for 1 question there's a frac{2}{3} chance of getting it right, and for the other 2 questions, a frac{1}{3} chance of getting them wrong.

Fifteen students scored ten marks fewer than the first ten students, which means they scored 80 marks each (90 - 10 = 80): Total marks for this group = 15 students * 80 marks/student = 1200 marks 3. The rest of the students scored 60 marks each. We have 50 students in total, and we've already accounted for 10 + 15 = 25 students, so the remaining number of students is 50 - 25 = 25 students: Total marks for this group = 25 students * 60 marks/student = 1500 marks Now, let's find the total marks for the whole class by adding the marks from all three groups: Total marks for the class = 900 marks + 1200 marks + 1500 marks = 3600 marks Finally, we'll calculate the average marks by dividing the total marks by the total number of students: Average marks = Total marks / Total number of students Average marks = 3600 marks / 50 students = 72 marks Therefore, the average marks for the whole class are boxed{72} ."},{"prompt":"What is the smallest positive multiple of 29 that is 7 more than a multiple of 97?","completion":"Let 29a be the multiple we seek.

This implies that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval [0, +infty). 2. **Even Function Property**: Since f(x) is an even function, it mirrors its behavior on the positive side of the x-axis to the negative side.

Given the monotonicity on both sides of the y-axis, this inequality implies that the argument closer to zero (in absolute value) corresponds to the larger function value because the function increases as we move towards zero from both sides. 4. **Determining the Range of a**: To find the range of a, we compare the absolute values of a+2 and a-3 because the function's behavior depends on the distance from zero due to its even nature and monotonicity.

This implies, for a number (a), the valuation (v_p(a)) is the highest power of (p) that divides (a). 3. **Large Valuation for a Constructed Term:** Considering infinitely many positive integers (a), we can ensure that (v_{p_i}(a) > v_{p_i}(f(1))) for all (i=1, 2, ldots, m).

To check if these sides can form a triangle, we apply the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Here, we have: - 4 + 4 > 9 (True) - 4 + 9 > 4 (True) - 4 + 9 > 4 (True) However, for an isosceles triangle with two equal sides of length 4, having the third side as 9 violates the specific property of isosceles triangles where the two equal sides are always longer than the base if the base is the shortest side. Thus, this configuration cannot form a proper isosceles triangle. **Case 2:** When the base is 9, the sides of the triangle would be 4, 9, and 9.

Given the triangle (ABC) with centroid (G), we are required to find the position of the point (P) such that the expression [ AP cdot AG + BP cdot BG + CP cdot CG ] is minimized. 2.

Consider the general inequality involving any point (P) in the plane: [ AP cdot AG + BP cdot BG + CP cdot CG ] 4. By placing (P) at the centroid (G), we can simplify the problem due to the symmetrical properties of the centroid. We will use vector algebra principles to formalize and further justify this choice. 5. Recall the definition and properties of the dot product in vector form: [ AP cdot AG = overrightarrow{AP} cdot overrightarrow{AG}, quad BP cdot BG = overrightarrow{BP} cdot overrightarrow{BG}, quad CP cdot CG = overrightarrow{CP} cdot overrightarrow{CG} ] 6. Consider the expression involving the centroid (G): [ overrightarrow{A}G = -frac{1}{3}(overrightarrow{B} + overrightarrow{C} - 2overrightarrow{A}) ] And analogous expressions for (overrightarrow{B}G) and (overrightarrow{C}G): [ overrightarrow{B}G = -frac{1}{3}(overrightarrow{C} + overrightarrow{A} - 2overrightarrow{B}), quad overrightarrow{C}G = -frac{1}{3}(overrightarrow{A} + overrightarrow{B} - 2overrightarrow{C}) ] 7.

Considering the homothety centered at (A) that transforms the excircle tangent to (BC) into the incircle of ( triangle ABC ), the point (A_2) corresponds to a point (E) on the incircle and on segment (AA_2) such that the tangent line to this incircle at (E) is parallel to (BC). Consequently, points (E), (Q), and (P) lie on the same line, where (Q) is the midpoint of (PE). Since (Q) and (A_1) are midpoints on the triangle (A_2PE), segment (A_1Q) is the midline and thus parallel to (AA_2). Similarly, homotheties centered at (B) and (C) respectively prove that (B_1Q parallel BB_2) and (C_1Q parallel CC_2). Therefore, under the homothety with center (M) and coefficient (-frac{1}{2}), (A rightarrow A_1), (A A_2 rightarrow A_1Q), (B rightarrow B_1), and (BB_2 rightarrow B_1Q), (C rightarrow C_1), and (CC_2 rightarrow C_1Q). The Nagel point (N), the intersection of lines (AA_2), (BB_2), and (CC_2), is transformed under this homothety into the incenter (Q) of triangle ( triangle ABC ). Thus, the segments (MN) and (MQ) both lie along the same line with (M) being the centroid making (MN = 2MQ). 1. **Proving (S) and (S') coincide** Under the homothety centered at (N) with coefficient (frac{1}{2}), the incenter (s) of triangle (ABC) maps to the midpoint (Q_2) of (NQ), which also bisects (Q) and lies halfway along (NQ). Under homothety centered again at (N) with coefficient (frac{1}{2}), the incircle of triangle (ABC) becomes the circle (S'), inscribed in the triangle formed by the midpoints (A', B', C') of (NA, NB, NC) respectively. From the midline theorem, the triangles (A_1B_1C_1) and (A'B'C') are homothetic with a shared center at the midline centroid (M) This proves that the incenter (Q_1) and (Q_2) are the same and also show on the line through the centroid and (N), thus making circle (S) coincide with (S'). 2. **Proving Circle (S) touching midlines** Under homothety centered at (M) and scaling factor (-frac{1}{2}), sides of the larger triangle map to respective triangle sides and the incenter stays consistent, thus attached to midlines proving equal distance from coordinate construction. This proves tangency. 3. **Proving Circle (S') touching mutually right side connectors** Connecting midlines and then center-based symmetrical proof with the centroid midpoint tangent properties completes the necessary systemic understanding. This brings the necessary and sufficient conclusion that the transforming alignments fit ensuring: [ boxed{ text{1. Circles (S) and (S') are identical} }] [ boxed{ 2.

The task is to prove that with jumps of length (r), the grasshopper can reach at most 8 distinct points. 1. **Starting Point and Naming Conventions:** - Let ( A_1 ) be the starting point on the circle. - Let ( B_1 ) be the point on the straight line after the first jump. - From ( B_1 ), the grasshopper jumps back to the circle at point ( A_2 ). - Let ( B_2 ) be the point reached after the next jump to the line, and so on. Notice that the sequence of points alternates between the circle ((A_i)) and the line ((B_i)). Geometric Insight: 2. **Identifying Rhombuses and Parallel Sections:** - The segments ( A_1B_1A_2O ) and ( A_2B_2A_3O ) form rhombuses because they consist of segments of equal length ( r ). - These rhombuses imply that ( A_1B_1 parallel B_2A_3 ). Hence, the points ( A_1, B_1, B_2, A_3 ) form a parallelogram. - Consequently, ( A_1A_3 ) is parallel to ( B_1B_2 ), and because ( B_1B_2 ) is a segment on the line, ( A_1A_3 ) is also parallel to the line. 3. **Repeating Pattern:** - If you apply the same reasoning and increment all indices by 2, you get ( A_3A_5 parallel text{the line} ). Thus, ( A_1 = A_5 ) after a full cycle. - By symmetry and alternation, the sequence of points ( A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2, A_3, B_3, A_4, B_4 ) will cycle back to ( A_1 ) after ( A_4, B_4 ). No new distinct points are introduced beyond these 8 points. 4. **Concluding the Sequence:** - Since every point has at most 2 possible moves from it (one back to the circle and one forward to the line), and these moves eventually cycle back to previously visited points, no more than 8 distinct points can ever be reached. Conclusion: We have shown through geometric insights and the characteristics of the grasshopper's jumps that only 8 distinct points can be reached in this cyclical manner.

Each color appears on infinitely many lines parallel to the xaxis. 2. For any white point A, red point B, and black point C, it is always possible to find a red point D such that A B C D forms a parallelogram.","completion":"To address the problem, we need to fulfill two conditions: 1. Each color (white, red, black) must appear on infinitely many horizontal lines. 2. For any white point A, black point C, and red point B, we must be able to find another red point D such that ABCD forms a parallelogram. Let's satisfy these conditions by following a systematic approach: Step 1: Color Assignment - Let's consider the line y = x (the line with slope 1, passing through the origin) in the coordinate plane. - We'll color the points on this line alternately black and white. Specifically, we will assign: - All points on the line y=x where x is an integer such that x mod 2 = 0 will be colored black. - All points on the line y=x where x mod 2 neq 0 will be colored white. - The rest of the grid points will be colored red. This assignment clearly meets condition (1) because: - Every horizontal line intersects y = x, ensuring infinitely many black and white points. - By coloring all other points red, it is clear that every horizontal line will also contain infinitely many red points. Step 2: Satisfying Condition 2 Let's now verify that for any white point A, black point C, and red point B, we can always find a red point D such that ABCD forms a parallelogram. Consider: - A white point A at coordinates A(x_1, y_1) where x_1 = y_1 and x_1 mod 2 neq 0. - A black point C at coordinates C(x_2, y_2) where x_2 = y_2 and x_2 mod 2 = 0. - A red point B(x_3, y_3). Step 3: Finding Point D We need to find coordinates (x, y) for a red point D such that ABCD is a parallelogram. The coordinates (x, y) must satisfy: [ D(x, y) = (x_1 + x_2 - x_3, y_1 + y_2 - y_3) ] Since x_1 = y_1 and x_2 = y_2 by definition of points on y=x, we get: [ D(x, y) = (x_1 + x_2 - x_3, x_1 + x_2 - y_3) ] For D to be a red point, the following must hold: [ x neq y implies x_1 + x_2 - x_3 neq x_1 + x_2 - y_3 implies x_3 neq y_3 ] Since B is colored red, and red points are not on the line y=x, we have x_3 neq y_3 inherently from color definition. Thus, D must be a red point. Step 4: Median Calculation for Parallelogram Finally, to confirm ABCD forms a parallelogram, the midpoints of diagonals AC and BD should be the same. Calculate the midpoint of AC: [ left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} right) = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) text{ (since } x_1 = y_1 text{ and } x_2 = y_2 text{)} ] Calculate the midpoint of BD: [ left( frac{x_3 + (x_1 + x_2 - x_3)}{2}, frac{y_3 + (x_1 + x_2 - y_3)}{2} right) = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) ] Therefore, A, B, C, D form a parallelogram. # Conclusion: This systematic approach satisfies both required conditions, establishing a valid way to color all the grid points.

On Wednesday, she does twice as many push-ups as she did on Tuesday, so that's 2T. On Thursday, she does half the number of total push-ups she already did that week. So, we need to add up the push-ups from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to find out how many she did on Thursday. That would be 5 (Monday) + T (Tuesday) + 2T (Wednesday). So, on Thursday, she does (5 + T + 2T)/2 push-ups. On Friday, she does as many push-ups as the total number she did over the previous four days, which is 39 push-ups.

Since vec{n} is perpendicular to both a and b, it means vec{n} parallel overrightarrow{C D}. 3. Consider the vector equation: [ overrightarrow{A B} = overrightarrow{A C} + overrightarrow{C D} + overrightarrow{D B} ] This represents that vector overrightarrow{A B} can be decomposed into the sum of vectors overrightarrow{A C}, overrightarrow{C D}, and overrightarrow{D B}. 4.

Substitute this back into our equation: [ |overrightarrow{A B} cdot vec{n}| = | overrightarrow{C D} | cdot | vec{n} | ] 11.

B: To check if the magnitudes are equal, we need to compute |overrightarrow a| and |overrightarrow b|. |overrightarrow a| = sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = 1, |overrightarrow b| = sqrt{left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{2}right)^2} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. The magnitudes are not equal, so B is incorrect. C: The dot product of overrightarrow a and overrightarrow b is overrightarrow a cdot overrightarrow b = 1 cdot frac{1}{2} + 0 cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}. Thus, C is incorrect. D: To check for parallelism, we can use the determinant of the matrix formed by the vectors: x_1y_2 - x_2y_1 = 1 cdot frac{1}{2} - 0 cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} neq 0. Since the determinant is not zero, overrightarrow a is not parallel to overrightarrow b, so D is incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{text{A}}"},{"prompt":"Write the following expression as a polynomial: (2x^2 + 5x + 8)(x+1) (x+1)(x^2 2x + 50) + (3x 7)(x+1)(x 2).","completion":"Factoring out (x+1) from each term, we can represent the expression as: (x+1) left( (2x^2 + 5x + 8) - (x^2 - 2x + 50) + (3x - 7)(x - 2) right). Now, simplify each term within the parentheses: begin{align*} (2x^2 + 5x + 8) - (x^2 - 2x + 50) &= 2x^2 + 5x + 8 - x^2 + 2x - 50, &= (2x^2 - x^2) + (5x + 2x) + (8 - 50), &= x^2 + 7x - 42. end{align*} Additionally, multiplying (3x - 7)(x - 2) results in: begin{align*} 3x(x - 2) - 7(x - 2) &= 3x^2 - 6x - 7x + 14, &= 3x^2 - 13x + 14. end{align*} Therefore, plugging these into the factored expression: begin{align*} (x+1) left( x^2 + 7x - 42 + 3x^2 - 13x + 14 right) &= (x+1)(x^2 + 3x^2 + 7x - 13x - 42 + 14), &= (x+1)(4x^2 - 6x - 28). end{align*} Expanding (x+1)(4x^2 - 6x - 28): 4x^3 - 6x^2 - 28x + 4x^2 - 6x - 28 = 4x^3 - 2x^2 - 34x - 28. Thus, the final polynomial expression is: boxed{4x^3 - 2x^2 - 34x - 28}."},{"prompt":"Four circles of radius 1 are externally tangent to each other and internally tangent to a larger circle. What is the radius of the large circle? Express your answer as a common fraction in simplest radical form.","completion":"Let O be the center of the large circle, and let C_1, C_2, C_3, and C_4 be the centers of the small circles, arranged such that each pair of adjacent small circles are tangent to each other. By symmetry, the centers of the small circles form a square. Since each side of the square is 2 (the sum of the diameters of two small circles), and each diagonal of the square will be 2sqrt{2} (by the Pythagorean theorem in half of the square, which forms a 45-45-90 triangle). The center of the square formed by the small circles will be the centroid of the square, which is equidistant from each small circle's center. If G is the centroid of the square, GC_1 = frac{2sqrt{2}}{2} = sqrt{2}. Adding the radius of a small circle, the radius R of the large circle is: [ R = sqrt{2} + 1 = boxed{1 + sqrt{2}}. ]"},{"prompt":"starts raining at 7:00 and pours heavily until its stops at 17:00 on a particular day.

According to the information given, ( S = 3C ). Since the total number of guests is 80, we can write the equation: [ C + S = 80 ] Substituting ( S ) with ( 3C ), we get: [ C + 3C = 80 ] [ 4C = 80 ] [ C = 80 / 4 ] [ C = 20 ] So, 20 guests want chicken and the rest want steak. Since ( S = 3C ), we can calculate ( S ) as: [ S = 3 times 20 ] [ S = 60 ] Now, we can calculate the total cost for the chicken and steak entrees. The cost for chicken entrees is: [ 20 text{ guests} times 18 text{ per chicken entree} = 360 ] The cost for steak entrees is: [ 60 text{ guests} times 25 text{ per steak entree} = 1500 ] The total catering budget is the sum of the cost for chicken and steak entrees: [ 360 text{ for chicken} + 1500 text{ for steak} = 1860 ] Therefore, the total catering budget is boxed{1860} ."},{"prompt":"A twodigit number is a multiple of 2.
