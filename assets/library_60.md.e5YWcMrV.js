According to the problem, when x is divided by the greatest number (which is 144), it leaves a remainder of 23. Similarly, when 7373 is divided by 144, it leaves a remainder of 29. We can express these conditions using the following equations: 1) x = 144k + 23 2) 7373 = 144m + 29 Where k and m are integers representing the quotient when x and 7373 are divided by 144, respectively. We need to find the value of x. We already know the value of 7373 when divided by 144 leaves a remainder of 29. Let's find the quotient first: 7373 - 29 = 7344 Now, 7344 is divisible by 144. To find the quotient (m), we divide 7344 by 144: 7344 / 144 = 51 So, m = 51. Now, we know that 7373 is 51 times 144 plus a remainder of 29. We can use this information to find the value of k for the first number x. Since the remainders when x and 7373 are divided by 144 are 23 and 29 respectively, and the greatest number that divides both x and 7373 is 144, we can say that x is also some multiple of 144 plus 23. We can find the value of k by using the fact that the difference between the remainders when x and 7373 are divided by 144 is 29 - 23 = 6. This means that x is 6 less than a multiple of 144 that gives a remainder of 29 when divided by 144. So, we can write: x = 144k + 23 x = (144 * 51) + 23 - 6 x = (144 * 51) + 17 Now we calculate the value of x: x = (144 * 51) + 17 x = 7344 + 17 x = 7361 Therefore, the first number is boxed{7361} ."},{"prompt":"f moving points A (x_1, y_1) and B (x_2, y_2) are on lines l_1: x+y7=0 and l_2: x+y5=0 respectively, and point N moves on the circle C: x^2+y^2=8, then the minimum value of the distance |MN| from the midpoint M of AB to point N is ( ) A: boxed{sqrt {2}} B: 2( sqrt {3} sqrt {2}) C: sqrt {3} D: 2 sqrt {2}","completion":"Given moving points A (x_1, y_1) and B (x_2, y_2) are on lines l_1: x+y-7=0 and l_2: x+y-5=0 respectively, the equation of the trajectory of the midpoint M of AB is: x+y-6=0.

Since there is exactly one counterfeit coin which is lighter, it follows that coins 1 and 2 must be genuine. Therefore, the counterfeit coin must be coin 3. Conclusion in this case: The counterfeit coin is coin 3. 4. **Case 2: Balance Not in Equilibrium**: If the balance is not in equilibrium, one of the coins on the balance must be the counterfeit coin. Since we know the counterfeit coin is lighter, we can determine which coin is counterfeit by looking at which side of the balance is higher: - If coin 1 is on the left pan and the left pan is higher (indicating coin 1 is lighter), then coin 1 is the counterfeit coin. - If coin 2 is on the right pan and the right pan is higher (indicating coin 2 is lighter), then coin 2 is the counterfeit coin. Conclusion in this case: The counterfeit coin is the lighter one on the balance. # Conclusion: Yes, it is possible to identify the counterfeit coin using just one weighing on a balance scale without any weights. Therefore, the final conclusion is: (boxed{text{Yes}})"},{"prompt":"The speed of a car increases by some kms after every one hour.

The distance traveled in the first hour is 40 km. In the second hour, the car will travel ( 40 + x ) km. In the third hour, the car will travel ( 40 + 2x ) km. This pattern continues, so in the 12th hour, the car will travel ( 40 + 11x ) km. The total distance traveled in 12 hours is the sum of all these distances, which is given as 612 km. So we can write the equation: [ 40 + (40 + x) + (40 + 2x) + ldots + (40 + 11x) = 612 ] This is an arithmetic series with the first term ( a_1 = 40 ) and the common difference ( d = x ).

First, let's calculate the total man-hours required to asphalt 1 km of road by the first group of 30 men. Total man-hours for 1 km = Number of men × Number of days × Number of hours per day Total man-hours for 1 km = 30 men × 12 days × 8 hours/day Total man-hours for 1 km = 2880 man-hours Since the first group of men took 2880 man-hours to asphalt 1 km of road, asphalting 2 km of road would require twice the man-hours.

The vectors overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{BC} can be represented as: [overrightarrow{AB} = (b-a, b^2 - a^2), quad overrightarrow{BC} = (c-b, c^2 - b^2)] Given that AB perp BC, the dot product overrightarrow{AB} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = 0, which leads to: [1 + (b+a)(c+b) = 0] This implies that: [|b+a| cdot |c+b| = 1] Assuming |c+b| leq 1, then we can express a as: [a = -b - frac{1}{b+c}] The perimeter of rectangle ABCD is calculated as 2(|AB| + |BC|). It can be shown that this perimeter is always greater than 3sqrt{3}, as the equality cannot be achieved simultaneously for |b+c| = 1 and |b+c| = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Therefore, we conclude that the perimeter of rectangle ABCD is boxed{text{greater than } 3sqrt{3}}. **Solution 2:** Assuming A, B, and D lie on the parabola W, while C does not. The goal is to prove |AB| + |AD| > frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}. By translating the coordinate system, the parabola W can be represented as y = x^2 without affecting the proof. Let A(a, a^2) and translate the coordinate system so that A becomes the origin. The new equation of the parabola is: [y' = x'^2 + 2ax'] In polar coordinates, this becomes: [rho sin theta = rho^2 cos^2 theta + 2a rho cos theta] Solving for rho, we get: [rho = frac{sin theta - 2a cos theta}{cos^2 theta}] The inequality to be proven simplifies to: [|frac{1}{cos theta} + frac{cos theta}{sin^2 theta}| > frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}] By applying the mean inequality, it can be shown that the inequality holds true, thus proving the proposition. Therefore, the perimeter of rectangle ABCD is boxed{text{greater than } 3sqrt{3}}."},{"prompt":"Let mathbf{u}_0 be a vector.

For Company X, the total charge is: ( 575 + (p times 575) + i ) For Company Y, the total charge is: ( 530 + (p times 530) + i ) We know that the difference between the total charges of the two companies is 41.60, so we can set up the following equation: ( 575 + (p times 575) + i - (530 + (p times 530) + i) = 41.60 ) Simplifying the equation by canceling out the installation charge ( i ) on both sides, we get: ( 575 + (p times 575) - 530 - (p times 530) = 41.60 ) Now, let's distribute the surcharge percentage ( p ) on both terms: ( 575 + 575p - 530 - 530p = 41.60 ) Combine like terms: ( 575 - 530 + 575p - 530p = 41.60 ) ( 45 + 45p = 41.60 ) Now, we can see that the surcharge percentage ( p ) does not matter because it will be multiplied by the same amount (45) for both companies, and thus it will cancel out. The difference in price without the surcharge and installation charge is already 45, which is more than the total savings of 41.60.

Let these projections on AD be B_1 (where B_1 is on AD) and C_1 (where C_1 is on AD). 4. **Establish Right Triangles**: Note that triangle ABD and triangle ACD are right triangles because AD is the diameter and the angle subtended by the diameter (which is an inscribed angle) is a right angle (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem). 5. **Use Geometry of Right Triangles**: - In triangle ABD, AB^2 = AB_1 cdot AD. - In triangle ACD, AC^2 = AC_1 cdot AD. These equations arise because in right triangles, the altitude to the hypotenuse (line segments from B and C projected onto AD) creates segments that are proportional in the manner shown.

Let’s break down the steps to understand this condition and how it leads to finding those n geq 2 for which A_n is odd. 1. **Analyze the Distance Condition:** Suppose m is a positive integer and consider the distance d from n to the nearest multiple of m. We express this as: [ m mid (n - k) quad text{for some integer} quad k ] which implies: [ n equiv k pmod{m} ] Similarly, for n^3, the distance from n^3 to the nearest multiple of m must also be d.

Thus, for A_n to be odd, the difference tau(n^3 - n) + tau(n^3 + n) must be odd, implying: 1. Neither n^3 - n nor n^3 + n can be perfect squares since n^2 + 1 needs to be a square, contradicting n geq 2 because perfect squares are non-sequential. 7. **GCD Analysis:** [ gcd(n^3 - n, n^3 + n) = gcd(n, 2) times n ] Thus, the exact form of this GCD depends on whether n is even or odd: [ gcd(n^3 - n, n^3 + n) = begin{cases} n & text{if } n text{ is even} 2n & text{if } n text{ is odd} end{cases} ] 8. **Conclusion on A_n:** For A_n to be odd: - n must be even because tau(n) is odd only if n is a perfect square. - Hence n must be an even perfect square, i.e., n = (2k)^2 for some integer k.

If O is on the opposite side of AC relative to B, or on the line AB, it contradicts the equal area condition, as follows: - The three regions exterior to line AB will have a greater combined area than the four regions on the other side relative to triangle ABC. 6. **Conclusion:** The only viable configuration would be placing O on the same side of AB as point C. Reflecting S (the exterior region of triangle ABC) about AB results in a region whose area within the circle k is smaller than the area of its corresponding reflected region within triangle ABC. Given every possible reflection results in unequal areas for the divided regions, we conclude it is not possible to divide the circle into seven regions of equal area using lines through three interior points. Hence, it is proven that it is impossible to choose three points inside a circle such that the lines passing through these points divide the circle into seven regions of equal area. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the set U={xmid x > 0}, and the complement of A in U is {xmid 0 < x < 3}, determine the set A=( ).

We know that K B is parallel to C M. This implies that triangles triangle K B L and triangle M C L are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion due to corresponding angles being equal. 4. There exists a homothety centered at point L which maps triangle K B L onto triangle M C L. The crucial observation here is that since angle K L M is the same for both triangles and sides are parallel, triangle K B L and triangle M C L are similar. 5. Consider the points of intersection of the circles with A L. The circles O_1 and O_2 intersect A L at points K and M respectively as described in the problem. 6. Since K and M lie on A L, and A L is the angle bisector of angle B A C, this geometrical property helps us in establishing the relationship provided by the homothety. Now, since K L and L M are segments on the angle bisector and their ratios are preserved, C A' and A' A are tangents from points on the circles intersecting A B, they are equal. 7. Therefore, we have: [ angle C A' A = angle A' A B = angle A' A C ] This implies that triangle A' C A is isosceles. 8. Given that C A and C A' are tangent to the circle O_2, it implies C O_2 bisects the angle A C A' which is also the height of triangle A' C A. 9.

Continuing this selection process, we can see that the courses could be scheduled in periods 1, 3, 5, and 7. **Step 2: Count all possible valid starts and follow the pattern of skipping one period each time.** - Positions can start from period 1, or potentially period 2. If started from period 2, the possible periods are 2, 4, 6. - However, after position 6, there's only one period left, thus limiting possible starts when strictly applying the every-other-period placement. Positions starting from period 3 onward are more restricted and might only apply in fewer ways or scheduling adjustments. **Step 3: Arrangement of subjects during these periods.** - Each arrangement of non-consecutive periods allows for the courses to be ordered in 4! ways, given that distinct courses can be shuffled among selected periods. Using this approach, first, we calculate the unrestricted selection of 4 periods from the possible valid start points: - (1, 3, 5, 7) - (2, 4, 6) (note only 3 periods, so not enough - disregard this sequence) Thus there's only one valid sequence of periods satisfying our condition. **Step 4: Calculate the total ways to arrange courses.** For the valid sequence of periods (1, 3, 5, 7): [ text{Possible arrangements} = 4! = 24 ] The correct number of ways to schedule the courses while meeting the requirements is 24.

This is because the symmetry with respect to the line y=x implies that the x and y coordinates are swapped in the symmetric function, and the square root function is the inverse of the square function in this domain. Given the transformation applied to g(x) to obtain h(x), which involves shifting 2 units to the right and 2 units down, we can express h(x) as: h(x)=g(x-2)-2=sqrt{x-2}-2 quad text{for} quad xgeq 2. The graph of h(x) is thus symmetric to f(x) with respect to the line y=x-2. This implies that the minimum distance between points on the graphs of f(x) and h(x) is twice the perpendicular distance from a point on f(x) to the line y=x-2. To find this distance, we first determine the slope of the tangent line to f(x) at a point P(x_{0}, y_{0}). Since f(x)=x^{2}, its derivative f'(x)=2x gives the slope of the tangent line at any point on f(x). The slope of the line y=x-2 is 1, so to find the point P where the tangent line is parallel to y=x-2, we set 2x_{0}=1, yielding: x_{0}=frac{1}{2}, quad y_{0}=left(frac{1}{2}right)^{2}=frac{1}{4}.

Let ( X ) represent a successful hit with a single shot and ( Y ) represent a failure that requires a second shot.

Proof: - Note that (AQ parallel BP) as both are perpendicular to (CD). Also, (AP cap BQ = X). Therefore, (frac{PX}{XA} = frac{BX}{XQ}). - Similarly, (BR parallel CQ) as both are perpendicular to (AD). Also, (BQ cap CR = X). Therefore, (frac{BX}{XQ} = frac{RX}{XC}). - Hence, (frac{PX}{XA} = frac{RX}{XC} Rightarrow AC parallel PR). - Also, (AR parallel CP) as both are perpendicular to (BD). - Hence, (square ARCP) is a parallelogram. Therefore, (X), which is the intersection of its diagonals, is indeed the midpoint of the diagonals. - Thus, (X) is the midpoint of (AP) and (CR). We can similarly prove that (X) is the midpoint of (BQ). Hence, proved claim 1. (blacksquare) 2. **Claim 2**: (D) is the orthocenter of (triangle PQR). Proof: - We proved that (square ARCP) is a parallelogram. We can similarly prove that (square AQBP) and (square BRQC) are parallelograms. - (PD) is perpendicular to (BC) as (P) is the orthocenter of (triangle BCD). Hence, (PD) is perpendicular to (QR) as (BC parallel QR) using the parallelogram (square BRQC). - We can similarly prove that (QD) is perpendicular to (PR) and (RD) is perpendicular to (PQ). Hence, (D) is the orthocenter of (triangle PQR). (blacksquare) 3. **Claim 3**: (X) is the midpoint of (DS) where (S) is the orthocenter of (triangle ABC). Proof: - From the three parallelograms, (square ARCP), (square AQBP), (square BRQC), we get that (PQ = AB), (QR = BC), (PR = AC). Hence, (triangle ABC sim triangle PQR). - Further, (AP), (BQ), (CR) intersect at (X). Hence, there is a homothety centered at (X) mapping (triangle ABC) to (triangle PQR) with scale factor (1). - Hence, under this homothety, the orthocenter of (triangle ABC) gets mapped to the orthocenter of (triangle PQR). - Hence, using claim 2, (S) gets mapped to (D) under this homothety. - Therefore, (SD) has midpoint (X) due to the homothety at (X) with scale factor (1). Hence, proved claim 3. (blacksquare) 4. **Claim 4**: (square PQRS) is a cyclic quadrilateral. Proof: - We present a proof using complex numbers. Let (a) be the complex number representing (A) and similar notation throughout the proof. - We can assume without loss of generality that (a, b, c) lie on the unit circle. - It is equivalent to prove that (d) also lies on the unit circle. - As (a, b, c) lie on the unit circle, the orthocenter of (triangle ABC), which is (S), will be (s = a + b + c). - (X) is the midpoint of (SD) using claim 3. Hence, (x = frac{s + d}{2} = frac{a + b + c + d}{2}). - Also, (X) is the midpoint of (AP), (BQ), (CR) using claim 1. Hence, we get that (p = b + c + d), (q = a + c + d), (r = a + b + d). - Since (a, b, c) lie on the unit circle, it follows that (d) must also lie on the unit circle. Hence, (A, B, C, D) lie on the unit circle and hence are cyclic. (blacksquare) Note that a homothety centered at (X) with scale factor (1) sends (square ABCD) to (square PQRS). As (square PQRS) is cyclic from claim 4, hence so is (square ABCD)! Hence proved!

This statement needs to be scrutinized under all possible roles the defendant can have. We will evaluate the truthfulness and consequences of each role one by one: 1. **If the defendant is a Knight:** - Knights always tell the truth. - If the defendant is a knight, the statement they made must be true. - Thus, if the statement is true: \\"Either I am a knight and not guilty, or I am a liar and guilty.\\" - Since the defendant is indeed a knight: [ text{I am a knight AND not guilty} quad (text{as the first part of the statement }) ] - This means the defendant is not guilty, as they cannot be a guilty knight because knights do not lie. Conclusion: Therefore, if the defendant is a knight, they are not guilty. 2. **If the defendant is a Liar:** - Liars always lie. - Hence, if the defendant is a liar, their statement must be false. - The given statement was: \\"Either I am a knight and not guilty, or I am a liar and guilty.\\" - If this statement is false, then: [ text{It cannot be true that: \\"I am a knight and not guilty\\"} quad text{AND} quad text{It cannot be true that: \\"I am a liar and guilty\\"} ] - Since the defendant is a liar, the second part (\\"I am a liar and guilty\\") has to be false. - Therefore, we must negate the overall statement because the liar is making this statement: - The part \\"I am a liar and guilty\\" is negated to \\"I am a liar and not guilty\\" - Hence the resulting understanding is: [ text{I am a liar AND not guilty} ] Conclusion: Therefore, if the defendant is a liar, they are also not guilty. 3. **If the defendant is a Normal Person:** - The problem clearly states that “the criminal is not a normal person” (i.e., the criminal is either a knight or a liar). - Therefore, if the defendant is a normal person: - By the problem's definition, they cannot be the outlaw. - Thus, automatically, the defendant is not guilty.

We consider the numbers modulo 2. If there are ( m ) red (colored) squares, there are no more than ( 2^m ) possible states the board can be in, which is a finite number. 2. **Transformation and invertibility:** The transformation ( T(B_n) = B_{n+1} ) is invertible. To show this, we define the order of a square ((i,j)): - A square ((i,j)) is of order 1 if ((i,j)) is the only red square in ( S_{i,j} ). - Inductively, a square ((i,j)) is of order ( n+1 ) if there exists ((k,ell) in S_{i,j} ) where ((k,ell)) is of order ( n ), but there is no square of order ( ge n+1 ) in ( S_{i,j} ). The order of a square remains the same in each move. To invert ( T ), start at a square of order 1. These squares are always 1, so we know their previous state. Next, move to squares of order 2. These squares only contain squares of order 1, and since we know the previous state of order 1 squares, we can determine the previous state of order 2 squares (mod 2). Continuing in this manner, we can invert ( T ). 3. **Periodic sequence:** From steps 1 and 2, it follows that the sequence ( B_0, B_1, B_2, ldots ) is purely periodic.

In one move, if ( S_{i,j} ) has an even number of red squares, then ((i,j)) becomes 0, and if ( S_{i,j} ) has an odd number of red squares, then ((i,j)) becomes 1. This is the initial state. 4. **Reaching the state where all numbers are odd:** Since ( B_n ) is purely periodic, we must reach the state where every number is 1 (i.e., odd) in a finite number of moves. In fact, it must be less than ( 2^{m-1} - 1 ) moves when there are ( m ) red squares.

For example, if we take x = 1, the new page number would be 54 - 1 = 53. This shows that the page numbered 1 in the original numbering is numbered 53 in the reversed numbering. To find out for how many pages the new page number and old page number share the same units digit, we need to examine the conditions under which the units digit of x and 54-x are the same. This happens when the subtraction of the units digit of x from 10 results in the same units digit, which is true for units digits of 2 and 7 because: - For 2: 10 - 2 = 8 and 2 share no common units digit, but in the context of subtraction involving numbers like 52 and 54-52=2, the units digit remains the same due to the nature of subtraction not affecting the units digit in this specific scenario. - For 7: 10 - 7 = 3 and 7 share no common units digit, but similarly, in cases like 47 and 54-47=7, the units digit remains consistent for the same reason as above.

For f(x) to be always non-negative or non-positive, (m^2-5m+7) must be either always positive or equal to 0. Setting it equal to 1, we get: (m^2-5m+7) = 1. We then solve the quadratic equation yielded by the above setting: begin{align*} m^2 - 5m + 7 & = 1 m^2 - 5m + 6 & = 0 (m - 2)(m - 3) & = 0. end{align*} The solutions to this quadratic equation are m = 2 and m = 3. **Case 1:** When m=2, the function becomes f(x) = 1 cdot x^2, which is a parabola that opens upwards and does not pass through the third quadrant (since it's always non-negative). **Case 2:** When m=3, the function becomes f(x) = 1 cdot x^3, which is an odd function and its graph will definitely pass through the third quadrant when x is negative (since negative values of x will give negative values of f(x)). Thus, to ensure that the graph of the function does not pass through the third quadrant, we must have: [boxed{m = 2}.]"},{"prompt":"Compute [sum_{n=1}^{500} frac{1}{n^2 + 2n + 1}.]","completion":"First, we recognize that the term ( n^2 + 2n + 1 ) can be rewritten as ( (n+1)^2 ).

When ( n = 1 ), ( m = 2 ), and when ( n = 500 ), ( m = 501 ). Therefore, the sum becomes: [sum_{m=2}^{501} frac{1}{m^2}.] This is a partial sum of the series of reciprocals of squares starting from ( m = 2 ) to ( m = 501 ).

The key points are understanding how many moves the camel must make and the arrangement of the board. 1. **Understanding the Board and the Moves:** - A hexagonal board with side length ( m ) has a total of ( 3m^2 - 3m + 1 ) fields, as per the reference. - The camel must move across all fields exactly once. Therefore, the camel must make ( (3m^2 - 3m + 1) - 1 = 3m^2 - 3m ) moves, where the subtraction accounts for the initial position. 2. **Counting the Moves and Determining the Positions:** - The number of moves, ( 3m^2 - 3m ), is a multiple of 3. Therefore, starting from the initial field, after ( 3m^2 - 3m ) moves, the camel will land again on a field that has the same color as the initial field. - This statement about colors stems from the pattern of hexagonal boards, where fields are alternately colored in a checkerboard-like manner: each field has six neighboring fields of the opposite color. 3. **Contradiction for Neighboring Fields:** - Given that the camel ends on a field of the same color as the starting field, it is crucial to note that the field adjacent to the starting field would always be of the opposite color. - Therefore, a camel positioned on a field of a certain color can never directly move to an adjacent field that is also of the same color after making a specific number of moves equal to ( 3m^2 - 3m ). # Conclusion: According to the color pattern of the hexagonal board and the number of moves required (which is a multiple of 3 and results in landing on the same color field as the starting point), it is impossible for the camel to finish on a field directly adjacent to the starting field. Thus, the camel cannot accomplish the task of ending on a neighboring field to the one it started on.

From this, we can deduce that the center of the original circle is (-1, 1) and the radius r is 1. Let (a, b) be the symmetric point to (-1, 1) with respect to the line x-y+3=0. The symmetric point will satisfy the following system of equations due to the symmetric properties: 1. The midpoint between (a, b) and (-1, 1) should lie on the line x - y + 3 = 0. 2.

This approach simplifies the process by focusing on the opposite scenario of what we're interested in and then subtracting that probability from 1 (or in this case, calculating the number of favorable outcomes directly). 1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: Since each child can be either male or female, and Mr. Jones has 6 children, the total number of ways the genders of these children can be determined is 2^6. This is because there are 2 possibilities (male or female) for each of the 6 children, giving us: [ 2^6 = 64 ] So, there are 64 possible ways in which the genders of the children can be determined. 2. **Complementary Scenario (Equal Number of Sons and Daughters)**: The scenario we want to avoid to calculate our desired probability is the one where Mr. Jones has exactly 3 sons and 3 daughters. The number of ways this can happen is given by the binomial coefficient binom{6}{3}, which represents choosing 3 children to be sons (and thus the other 3 automatically being daughters) out of 6. This can be calculated as: [ binom{6}{3} = 20 ] This means there are 20 ways in which Mr. Jones can have exactly 3 sons and 3 daughters. 3. **Calculating the Desired Probability**: Using the concept of complementary counting, we subtract the number of ways Mr. Jones can have an equal number of sons and daughters from the total number of possible outcomes to find the number of ways he can have more children of one gender than the other. This gives us: [ 64 - 20 = 44 ] So, there are 44 ways in which Mr. Jones can have more sons than daughters or more daughters than sons out of a total of 64 possible ways. 4. **Final Probability**: To find the probability, we divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes: [ dfrac{44}{64} = dfrac{11}{16} ] Therefore, the probability that Mr. Jones has more sons than daughters or more daughters than sons is boxed{dfrac{11}{16}}."},{"prompt":"A plane travels due East at a certain speed and another plane travels due west at 275 miles per hour.

We need to prove that for an odd integer m, the expression (x + y + z)^m - x^m - y^m - z^m is divisible by (x + y + z)^3 - x^3 - y^3 - z^3. 2. First, let's simplify (x + y + z)^3 - x^3 - y^3 - z^3. Using algebraic identities, we have: [ (x + y + z)^3 = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + 3(x + y)(y + z)(z + x) ] Therefore: [ (x + y + z)^3 - x^3 - y^3 - z^3 = 3(x + y)(y + z)(z + x) ] 3. Next, we need to analyze (x + y + z)^m - x^m - y^m - z^m for an odd integer m. According to Bézout's theorem, if a polynomial P(x) is divisible by (x - a) and (x - b), then P(x) is also divisible by their product (x - a)(x - b). By extension, if P(x) is divisible by x + y, x + z, and y + z, then P(x) is also divisible by their product (x + y)(x + z)(y + z). 4. In our problem, let P(x) = (x + y + z)^m - x^m - y^m - z^m. To show divisibility by 3(x + y)(x + z)(y + z), we will use the fact that since m is odd, P(x) evaluated at x = -y, x = -z, and y = -z should yield zero. 5. Consider the following evaluations: - When x = -y: [ P(-y) = (x + y + z)^m - x^m - y^m - z^m = (0 + z)^m - (-y)^m - y^m - z^m ] [ = z^m - (-y)^m - y^m - z^m = z^m - (-y^m) - y^m - z^m = 0 ] - When x = -z: [ P(-z) = (x + y + z)^m - x^m - y^m - z^m = (y + 0)^m - (-z)^m - y^m - z^m ] [ = y^m - (-z^m) - y^m - z^m = 0 ] - When y = -z: [ P(-y) = (x + y + z)^m - x^m - y^m - z^m = (x + 0)^m - x^m - (-z)^m - z^m ] [ = x^m - x^m - (-z^m) - z^m = 0 ] 6.

The lines x+y=0 and x-y=0 do not intersect the circle x^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=2. We will use the distance formula between a point and a line to determine the conditions for tangency or non-intersection. The distance d between a point (x_0, y_0) and a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by the formula: d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. The center of the circle x^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=2 is (0, b), and its radius is sqrt{2}. To find the distance between the center of the circle and the lines, we'll plug in the center coordinates into the distance formula for each line: For the line x+y=0, we have A = 1, B = 1, and C = 0. The distance d_1 between the center and the line is: d_1 = frac{|1 cdot 0 + 1 cdot b + 0|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|b|}{sqrt{2}}. For the line x-y=0, we have A = 1, B = -1, and C = 0. The distance d_2 between the center and the line is: d_2 = frac{|1 cdot 0 - 1 cdot b + 0|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|b|}{sqrt{2}}. Now we have two cases: 1. Tangency: The distance between the center and the lines is equal to the radius of the circle. Thus, frac{|b|}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}. Solving for |b|, we get |b| = 2. Therefore, b = 2 or b = -2. 2. Non-intersection: The distance between the center and the lines is greater than the radius of the circle. Thus, frac{|b|}{sqrt{2}} > sqrt{2}. Solving for |b|, we get |b| > 2. Therefore, b > 2 or b < -2. Since the problem asks for the values of b that result in at most two distinct real solutions, both tangency and non-intersection cases apply. Thus, the range of real values of b is bgeqslant 2 or bleqslant -2. Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{B}."},{"prompt":"Let a, b, c, d be nonzero real numbers.

If there are some hearts on a card, the total cost of the cows when they are sold at 200 each is 83200.

If there are twice as many cows in Devonshire as there are hearts on a standard deck of playing cards, then there are 2 * 13 = 26 cows. If the total cost of the cows when they are sold at 200 each is 83200, we can calculate the number of cows by dividing the total cost by the cost per cow: Number of cows = Total cost / Cost per cow Number of cows = 83200 / 200 Number of cows = 416 Since we initially calculated that there should be 26 cows based on the number of hearts on a standard deck of playing cards, but the actual number of cows is 416, we need to find the correct number of hearts per card that would result in 416 cows. Let's denote the number of hearts per card as H. Then the number of cows would be twice that number: Number of cows = 2 * H We know the actual number of cows is 416, so: 416 = 2 * H H = 416 / 2 H = 208 Therefore, there would be 208 hearts on each card if the total number of cows is boxed{416} and each cow is sold at 200 to make a total of 83200.

Specify all possible values of ( k ).","completion":"Let's divide the solution into two parts: Part (a): Prove that for any set of more than two consecutive integers, there exists a number that can be erased so that the arithmetic mean of the remaining numbers is an integer. 1. Let the sequence of consecutive integers be given by ( a, a+1, a+2, ldots, a+n-1 ), where ( n geq 3 ). 2. The arithmetic mean of the sequence is: [ M = frac{a + (a+1) + (a+2) + cdots + (a+n-1)}{n} ] 3. Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, the sum of the integers can be written as: [ S = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a+i) = na + sum_{i=0}^{n-1} i = na + frac{(n-1)n}{2} ] 4. Thus, the arithmetic mean (M) is: [ M = frac{S}{n} = frac{na + frac{(n-1)n}{2}}{n} = a + frac{n-1}{2} ] 5. Suppose we erase a number (a+k) from the sequence. 6. The new sum of the remaining integers will be: [ S' = S - (a+k) = na + frac{(n-1)n}{2} - (a+k) ] 7. The new number of terms will be (n-1), and the new arithmetic mean (M') is: [ M' = frac{S - (a+k)}{n-1} = frac{na + frac{(n-1)n}{2} - a - k}{n-1} = frac{(n-1)a + frac{(n-1)n}{2} - k}{n-1} ] 8. Simplifying, we get: [ M' = a + frac{n-1}{2} - frac{k}{n-1} ] 9. For (M') to be an integer, (frac{k}{n-1}) must be an integer. Thus, (k) must be a multiple of (n-1). 10. Since (frac{n-1}{2}) is always an integer when (n) is odd, and when (n) is even, we can always find an integer (k) that satisfies the condition. Therefore, there is always at least one number that can be erased to achieve an integer arithmetic mean. Part (b): Find all the possible values of ( k ) that can be erased when the sequence contains the numbers from 1 to 100. 1. Consider the sequence: ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, 100 ). 2. The sum of the first 100 natural numbers is given by: [ S = frac{100(101)}{2} = 5050 ] 3. If we erase the number ( k ), the new sum becomes: [ S' = 5050 - k ] 4. The arithmetic mean of the remaining numbers should be an integer: [ M' = frac{S'}{99} = frac{5050 - k}{99} ] 5. For (M') to be an integer, ( 5050 - k ) must be divisible by 99: [ 5050 - k equiv 0 pmod{99} ] 6. Simplifying, we find: [ 5050 equiv k pmod{99} ] 7.

There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange these digits since each of the three positions can be occupied by any of the three digits without restriction. Now, we must insert the \\"+\\" and \\"-\\" symbols in such a way that no two digits are adjacent to each other. There are spaces before the first digit, between the three digits, and after the last digit where the symbols can be placed. The arrangement of 1, 2, 3 can be visualized with spaces shown by underscores as follows: _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ We have four spaces where we can insert the two symbols. Since we must choose 2 out of these 4 possible spaces and since the order of \\"+\\" and \\"-\\" matters, we use the permutation formula instead of the combination formula. Therefore, there are P(4, 2) = frac{4!}{(4-2)!} = frac{4 times 3 times 2!}{2!} = 4 times 3 = 12 ways to place the \\"+\\" and \\"-\\" symbols into these slots. Multiplying the number of digit permutations by the number of symbol placement methods gives 6 times 12 = 72 arrangements. However, this includes cases where digits may be adjacent. We need to subtract the arrangements that allow two digits to be adjacent. Since there are three pairs of adjacent slots among the digits (before-1, 2-3, 3-after), and each pair can have two possible symbols, we must subtract 3 times 2 = 6 from the total we found earlier. Note that the pair (1-2) cannot have both symbols because we only have two symbols total, and at least one must go in one of the other three spots. Therefore, the total number of permutations where no two digits are adjacent is 72 - 6 = 66. However, this does not match any answer from the provided options. Upon reviewing the solution, it seems there has been a misunderstanding. Correctly, we should recognize there are 4 potential spaces to insert two symbols. However, because we want no two digits to be adjacent, one symbol must come in the first slot, and the other in the last slot, yielding only 2 choices for the \\"+\\" and \\"-\\". This results in 2 times 3! = 2 times 6 = 12 valid permutations.

If we place these two copies of (P) such that they form two stripes covering the circle’s diameter, it implies that the combined width of these stripes should equal or exceed the circle's diameter.

Specifically, the external tangents which touch the circles at four distinct points. - Let ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) be the points where one common tangent touches ( C ) and ( C' ) respectively. - Let ( T_3 ) and ( T_4 ) be the points where the other common tangent touches ( C ) and ( C' ) respectively. 2. **Verification Using Similar Triangles:** - Suppose a circle touches ( C ) and ( C' ) at points ( P ) and ( Q ), respectively, and intersects the line ( XY ) at points ( R ) and ( S ). - Let ( PR ) meet ( C ) again at ( A ), and let ( QR ) meet ( C' ) again at ( B ). 3. **Proving Tangency:** - We need to show that line ( AB ) is tangent to both ( C ) and ( C' ). - First, note that ( P, A, X, Y ) are concyclic, thus: [ angle PRX = angle PAY. ] - Similarly, ( Q, B, X, Y ) are concyclic, thus: [ angle QRY = angle QBX. ] - Using these angle relationships: [ angle QPU = angle QPR = angle RQX, ] Since ( RX cdot RY = RP cdot RA ) and ( RB cdot RQ = RX cdot RY ), [ frac{RA}{RB} = frac{RQ}{RP}, ] implying ( triangle RAB sim triangle RQP ) by angle-angle similarity, therefore [ angle QPR = angle RAB. ] - Thus, ( angle QPU = angle RAB ), which implies ( AB ) is parallel to the tangent line at ( R ) concerning the third circle, meaning ( AB ) remains tangent to ( C ).

For example, a line segment of 1 centimeter in this case covers 2 integer points (the start and the end). Extending this logic, if a line segment's length allows it to start and end on integer points, it maximizes the number of integer points it covers. 2. **Endpoints Do Not Coincide with Integer Points:** If the endpoints of the line segment do not align exactly with integer points, then the line segment will cover fewer integer points. Specifically, a line segment of 1 centimeter in this scenario covers 1 integer point (excluding one of the endpoints if it is not an integer point). Given the length of line segment AB is 1752.1 centimeters, we analyze its potential to cover integer points. To maximize the number of integer points covered, we ideally want both endpoints to coincide with integer points. However, the decimal part (.1) suggests that one endpoint will not coincide with an integer point. - If we consider the possibility of both endpoints coinciding with integer points (ignoring the decimal for a moment), we would add 1 to the length to account for the endpoint, resulting in 1752.1 + 1 = 1753. Therefore, the maximum number of integer points that can be covered by the line segment AB is either directly related to its length (excluding the decimal, which gives us 1752 integer points) or considering the additional endpoint if it were possible to align both ends with integer points, which gives us 1753 integer points. Thus, the maximum number of integer points that can be covered by the line segment AB is either 1752 or 1753.

The height of the tower at point ( A ) is ( b ) and the length of the rod ( AB ) is ( a ). The rod ( AB ) extends the height of the tower by ( a ) units up to point ( B ).

Thus, we can write (x = du) and (y = dv), where (u) and (v) are coprime integers (i.e., (gcd(u, v) = 1)). 2. **Analyze Divisibility Conditions**: Given that (x^3 + y) is divisible by (x^2 + y^2), let's express it using our substitution: [ x^3 + y = d^3 u^3 + dv ] This expression must be divisible by: [ x^2 + y^2 = d^2 (u^2 + v^2) ] Therefore, (d^2(u^2 + v^2)) should divide (d^3 u^3 + dv).

Therefore, the heights from B and C to AP both equal frac{2 times [triangle ABC]}{AP}. As we just calculated, AH is 4, so the area of triangle ABC is: [triangle ABC] = frac{1}{2} times BC times AH = frac{1}{2} times 6 times 4 = 12.

Combining these conditions, we find that the domain of the function is the set of all real numbers x such that x < dfrac {3}{2} and x neq 1. This can be written as (-∞,1)∪(1, dfrac {3}{2}). Therefore, the domain of the function f(x)= dfrac {(x-1)^{0}}{ sqrt {3-2x}} is boxed{(-∞,1)∪(1, dfrac {3}{2})}. This problem requires understanding of the basic principles of function domains, specifically that the denominator of a fraction cannot be zero and the base of a zero-th power cannot be zero."},{"prompt":"This year is the year of victory in poverty alleviation in our country. Our country has made great achievements in poverty alleviation, and technological poverty alleviation has also enabled a certain county's electronic device factory in our province to overcome poverty and turn losses into profits. The electronic device factory produces a type of computer graphics card. In 2019, the factory price of this type of computer graphics card was 200 per unit. In 2020 and 2021, with the help of technological poverty alleviation, the technology was improved to reduce costs. In 2021, the factory price of this computer graphics card was adjusted to 162 per unit. (1) The percentage decrease in the factory price of this type of computer graphics card is the same for these two years. Find the average annual percentage decrease. (2) In 2021, a certain Seg computer city purchased a certain number of this type of computer graphics card at the factory price. When selling at 200 per unit, they can sell an average of 20 units per day. In order to reduce inventory quickly, the store decided to reduce the price for sale. After investigation, it was found that for every 3 decrease in unit price, 6 more units could be sold per day. If the daily profit is 1150, how much should the unit price be reduced?","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: Average Annual Percentage Decrease Let the average decrease rate be x. We are given that the price of the computer graphics card decreased from 200 to 162 over two years with the same percentage decrease each year. Therefore, we can set up the equation as follows: 200(1-x)^2 = 162 Solving for x, we get: begin{align*} (1-x)^2 &= frac{162}{200} (1-x)^2 &= 0.81 1-x &= sqrt{0.81} 1-x &= 0.9 quad text{or} quad 1-x = -0.9 end{align*} Solving for x from 1-x = 0.9, we get: x_1 = 0.1 = 10% Solving for x from 1-x = -0.9, we get: x_2 = 1.9 Since a decrease rate of 1.9 (or 190%) does not make sense in this context, we discard it. Therefore, the average annual percentage decrease is boxed{10%}. Part 2: Unit Price Reduction for Increased Sales Let the unit price decrease by m dollars. The profit per unit sold then becomes (200-m-162) = (38-m) dollars, and the number of units sold per day increases to 20 + frac{m}{3} times 6 = (20+2m). Given that the daily profit is 1150, we set up the equation: (38-m)(20+2m) = 1150 Expanding and simplifying, we get: begin{align*} 760 + 76m - 20m - 2m^2 &= 1150 -2m^2 + 56m - 390 &= 0 m^2 - 28m + 195 &= 0 end{align*} Solving this quadratic equation, we find the values of m: m_1 = 15, quad m_2 = 13 Since we aim to reduce inventory quickly, we choose the higher reduction in price, which is m = 15. Therefore, the unit price should be reduced by boxed{15 text{ dollars}}."},{"prompt":"a rightangled triangle ABC with the right angle at C, the point D is the intersection of the median from A and the circumscribed circle.

Since the tomato juice is 90% water, the amount of water in the 20 liters of tomato juice is: 0.90 * 20 liters = 18 liters When Heinz boils the tomato juice to make tomato puree, they are reducing the water content. They end up with 2.5 liters of tomato puree. Since the solids from the tomato juice would remain after boiling off the water, we can assume that the 2.5 liters of tomato puree contains the solids from the original 20 liters of tomato juice. The amount of solids in the original tomato juice can be calculated as: 100% - 90% = 10% solids So, the amount of solids in the 20 liters of tomato juice is: 0.10 * 20 liters = 2 liters Since the tomato puree is made up of the solids plus some of the water, the total volume of the tomato puree is the volume of the solids plus the remaining water.

We can represent ( A ) as ( A = overline{a_5 a_4 ldots a_0} ), where ( a_i ) are the digits of ( A ). 3. **Consider its Five-Digit Tail:** - ( A ) should be divisible by its five-digit tail ( overline{a_4 ldots a_0} ). Thus, the difference ( A - overline{a_4 ldots a_0} ) must be divisible by ( overline{a_4 ldots a_0} ). - The difference ( A - overline{a_4 ldots a_0} = a_5 cdot 10^5 ).

This is derived from Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. 2. **Checking Factorials for (n < 14):** We need to check the factorials (n!) for (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13) to see if they can be expressed as a sum of two squares. 3. **Eliminating Factorials with Prime Factors of the Form (4k+3):** For (n > 6), (n!) includes the prime number 7, which is of the form (4k+3). Since 7 appears with an odd exponent in (n!) for (n ge 7), these factorials cannot be expressed as a sum of two squares.

The train takes 30.99752019838413 seconds to cross the man, and during this time, the train covers its own length of 620 meters.

To make the units consistent, we need to convert the speed of the train to meters per second (m/s). We know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds.

This is because the sum of the first n-1 terms, S_{n-1}, relates to a_n in a similar way as S_n relates to a_{n+1}. **Step 2: Deriving the formula for a_{n+1}** Subtracting the two equations, 2S_{n}-2S_{n-1}=a_{n+1}-a_{n}-1+1, simplifies to 2a_{n}=a_{n+1}-a_{n}.

Given that the inequality f(x) leq 0 always holds, the maximum value of f(x) is 0. When x in (0, frac{1}{a - e}), f'(x) > 0, so f(x) is monotonically increasing.

Since 50% support Mark, he receives: 50% of 120,000 = 0.50 * 120,000 = 60,000 votes in the first area. Now, let's determine the population of the second area, which is 150% larger than the first area. 150% of 120,000 = 1.50 * 120,000 = 180,000 additional voters. So, the total number of registered voters in the second area is: 120,000 + 180,000 = 300,000 voters. In the second area, Mark receives 2.5 times the number of votes he received in the first area: 2.5 * 60,000 = 150,000 votes in the second area. Now, let's calculate the number of votes that are divided equally among the four candidates in the second area after accounting for the undecided voters. The undecided voter percentage in the second area is 2%, so the number of voters who cast their votes is: 98% of 300,000 = 0.98 * 300,000 = 294,000 voters. Since the remaining voters are divided equally among the four candidates, each candidate receives: 294,000 voters / 4 candidates = 73,500 votes. However, we've already calculated that Mark receives 150,000 votes in the second area, which is his total number of votes there. Now, let's add the votes Mark received in both areas to find his total number of votes: First area votes + Second area votes = Total votes 60,000 + 150,000 = 210,000 votes.

After the first move, all cards will be flipped, and no further moves can be made. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for any sequence of ( k < n ) cards, the game will necessarily end.

This is because each move affects exactly 41 cards, flipping their state. By carefully choosing his moves, Amir can force the game into a state where Ercole has no legal moves left.

The number of ways to choose 2 people out of 4 to go to one of the places (and the other 2 automatically go to the other place) is given by the combination formula: [binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6] Therefore, there are 6 different arrangements, making option B correct. **Option C:** To ensure each place has at least one volunteer, we can distribute the 4 volunteers in the following group sizes: 1-1-2, 1-2-1, or 2-1-1. Each distribution has 3 ways to assign the groups to the places, and there are 2 ways to pick who goes alone in the 1-1-2 distribution (and similarly for the other distributions). This gives us: [3 times (3 times 2) = 18] However, this calculation overlooks the fact that for the 1-1-2 distribution, we also need to consider the different ways to pick the 2 volunteers going together, which actually results in: [3 times binom{4}{2} = 3 times 6 = 18] And since there are 2 more distributions (1-2-1 and 2-1-1) that are essentially the same in terms of arrangement, we multiply by 3: [18 times 3 = 54] This contradicts the initial solution provided, indicating a need to reassess the calculation for option C. Upon reassessment, considering each unique distribution (1-1-2, 1-2-1, 2-1-1) and the ways to assign volunteers to these distributions correctly, the total arrangements should be calculated considering the permutations of volunteers to the places, which is: [6 times 3! = 6 times (3 times 2 times 1) = 36] So, option C is correctly stated as having 36 different arrangements. **Option D:** To allocate 20 identical ambulances to 3 places with at least one ambulance at each place, we can think of placing 2 dividers among the 20 ambulances to create 3 groups.

The triangle triangle I_AI_BI_C is homothetic to the intouch triangle triangle A_1B_1C_1 with the homothety center being the incenter I of triangle ABC. 2. **Orthocenter and Circumcenter Relationship:** Note that the incenter I of triangle ABC is the orthocenter of the excentral triangle triangle I_AI_BI_C. This is because the altitudes of triangle I_AI_BI_C are the angle bisectors of triangle ABC, which intersect at the incenter I. 3. **Euler Line of triangle I_AI_BI_C:** The Euler line of a triangle passes through its orthocenter, circumcenter, and the centroid.

These circles intersect ( AC ) at point ( N ) and ( AB ) at point ( M ) respectively. 2. We use the Power of a Point theorem applied to point ( B ) with respect to the circumcircle of ( triangle AEC ). The theorem states that for two secants intersecting outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant equals the product of the lengths of the segments of the other secant: [ BE cdot BC = BM cdot BA ] 3. Analogously, we apply the Power of a Point theorem for point ( C ) with respect to the circumcircle of ( triangle AEB ): [ CE cdot CB = CN cdot CA ] 4. We then divide the second equation by the first equation: [ frac{CE cdot CB}{BE cdot BC} = frac{CN cdot CA}{BM cdot BA} ] 5.

Therefore, it follows that: [ CN = BM ] Hence, we have proved that (CN = BM). 10. To show that the areas of ( triangle BME ) and ( triangle CNE ) are equal, we proceed using two methods: **Method 1: By Congruence of Triangles** - Observe that if arcs (BE) and (EN) are equal and arcs (ME) and (EC) are also equal, the chords subtending these arcs are equal: [ BE = EN quad text{and} quad ME = EC ] - Therefore, triangles (BME) and (CNE) share two sides and the angle between them respectively equal, hence are congruent by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) postulate. This implies that the areas of the triangles are equal. **Method 2: By Identical Heights** - Since (AE) is the angle bisector of ( angle BAC ), and given that (CN = BM), the altitudes from (E) to bases (CN) and (BM) are equal because they are perpendicular to equal bases (BM) and (CN). - Hence, the areas of triangles ( triangle BME ) and ( triangle CNE ) are equal because bases and corresponding heights are equal. # Conclusion: [ boxed{The areas of triangle BME and triangle CNE are equal.} ]"},{"prompt":"John cycled a total of 3671_9 kilometers.

We denote these islands in such a way that they form 6 groups, each containing 6 islands.

Since k must be an integer, the smallest k that satisfies this condition is k = 17. So the smallest 3-digit number in the sequence is 6(17) + 2 = 102. For the largest value: 6k + 2 ≤ 999 6k ≤ 997 k ≤ 997 / 6 k ≤ 166.166... Since k must be an integer, the largest k that satisfies this condition is k = 166.

Now we have an arithmetic sequence starting with 102 and ending with 998, with a common difference of 6 (since each subsequent number in the sequence is 6 more than the previous one). The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: Sum = n/2 * (first term + last term) where n is the number of terms. To find n, we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: last term = first term + (n - 1) * common difference 998 = 102 + (n - 1) * 6 896 = (n - 1) * 6 n - 1 = 896 / 6 n - 1 = 149 n = 150 Now we can find the sum: Sum = 150/2 * (102 + 998) Sum = 75 * 1100 Sum = 82500 So the sum of all 3-digit numbers that leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 6 is boxed{82,500} ."},{"prompt":"The ratio of cats to dogs at the pet store is 3:4.

We know from the reference [Kiss Gy.: Amit jó tudni a háromszögekről, KöMaL 52. évf. 3. szám (2002. március), 130-139. old] that the distances of the points where the incircle touches the legs of the triangle from vertex (C) are (s-c). 4. For the excircles, the distances from (C) to the points of tangency on the legs are (s-b), (s-a), and (s), respectively. 5. So, the radius of the incircle is (s-c) and the radii of the excircles are (s-a), (s-b), and (s). 6. Assume these four numbers form four consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence. This implies the order (s-c, s-b, s-a, s) must hold true. 7. For them to be in arithmetic progression, the common difference ((d)) must be equal throughout. Therefore: [ (s-b) - (s-c) = (s-a) - (s-b) = s - (s-a) ] Simplifying these, we obtain: [ (s-b) - (s-c) = b - c ] [ (s-a) - (s-b) = a - b ] [ s - (s-a) = a ] 8. This series of equalities implies: [ b - c = a - b = a ] Solving these, we see that: [ b - c = -2a ] [ b = 2a ] [ c = 3a ] 9. However, for (a, b,) and (c) to form a triangle, they must satisfy the triangle inequality. Specifically, (a + b > c): [ a + b = a + 2a = 3a = c ] 10. This implies: [ a + b = c ] which violates the triangle inequality since (a + b) must be strictly greater than (c). **Conclusion:** Hence, there does not exist a right triangle where the radii of the incircle and the three excircles form four consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence.

The line segment A_1B_1 intersects the circumcircle of triangle ABC at a point P. We aim to prove that: frac{1}{PA} = frac{1}{PB} + frac{1}{PC} Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Projection Points**: Let the perpendicular projections of P onto lines AB, AC, and BC be T_1, T_2, and T_3 respectively. 2. **Parallel Lines through A_1 and B_1**: - Draw a line parallel to AB through A_1 and call the intersection with line PT_1 as A_2. - Draw a line parallel to AC through A_1 and call the intersection with line PT_2 as A_3. - Draw a line parallel to PT_1 through B_1 and call the intersection with line A_1A_2 as B_2. - Draw a line parallel to PT_2 through B_1 and call the intersection with line A_1A_3 as B_3. 3. **Equidistance of Points**: Since A_1 and B_1 are angle bisectors, their distances to the sides of the triangle are equal. Let h_1 be the distance from A_1 to sides AB and AC, and h_2 be the distance from B_1 to sides AB and BC. 4. **Similarity of Triangles**: - The triangles A_1B_1B_2 and A_1PA_2 are similar because B_1B_2 is parallel to PA_2 and the other sides are common. - The similarity ratio is: frac{B_1B_2}{PA_2} = frac{A_1B_1}{A_1P} - Therefore, we have: B_1B_2 = |h_2 - h_1| implies PA_2 = frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1} |h_2 - h_1| 5. **Distance Relationships**: Similarly, in the triangles A_1B_1B_3 and A_1PA_3, the ratio: frac{PT_2 + h_1}{h_1} = frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1} So, PT_1 = T_1A_2 + PA_2 = h_1 + frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1} (h_2 - h_1) For internal point P: PT_1 = h_1 - frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1}(h_1 - h_2) 6. **Combining Relationships**: Combining the distances, we find: PT_2 = h_1 frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1} - h_1 So, PT_1 + PT_2 = h_1 + frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1} (h_2 - h_1) + h_1 frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1} - h_1 = frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1} h_2 7. **Additional Similarity**: Considering the triangles A_1C_3B_1 and A_1T_3P, by similarity: frac{PT_3}{B_1C_3} = frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1} implies PT_3 = B_1C_3 frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1} = h_2 frac{A_1P}{A_1B_1} 8. **Summarizing Projections**: Thus: PT_1 + PT_2 = PT_3 9. **Ratio Analysis**: Considering triangles PAT_2 and PBT_3, which are similar: frac{PT_3}{PB} = frac{PT_2}{PA} Using: frac{PT_1 + PT_2}{PB} = frac{PT_2}{PA} 10. **Final Transformation**: Using proportions in the cyclic quadrilateral PABC: frac{PB}{PC} + 1 = frac{PA}{PC} Simplifying, we get: frac{1}{PC} + frac{1}{PB} = frac{1}{PA} Hence, we have shown the required proof: frac{1}{PA} = frac{1}{PB} + frac{1}{PC} boxed{}"},{"prompt":"To comprehensively promote rural revitalization, a certain province implements a policy of urban assistance to towns.

Thus, the range of x is 10 leqslant x leqslant 120. The analytical expression of y in terms of x is y = 50x + 45000 for 10 leqslant x leqslant 120. Part 2: Calculating the Minimum Transportation Cost Since the coefficient of x in the expression y = 50x + 45000 is positive (50 > 0), y increases as x increases. Therefore, to minimize y, we choose the smallest possible value of x, which is x = 10. Substituting x = 10 into the expression for y: [ y = 50 times 10 + 45000 = 45500 ] Thus, the minimum transportation cost is 45500 yuan, achieved by transporting: - 10 tons of goods from city A to town A, - 110 tons from city A to town B (since city A had 120 tons and 10 were sent to town A), - 130 tons from city B to town A (to fulfill the remaining need of town A), - 0 tons from city B to town B (since city A fully supplies town B's needs).

The complementary (36^circ) angle will be the remaining part of this (90^circ). 5. **Bisect the (36^circ) Angle**: Use the compass and straightedge to bisect the (36^circ) angle: - Place the compass on the vertex of the (36^circ) angle. - Draw an arc that intersects both rays of the angle.

We start by considering the expression frac{2^a - 2^b}{2^c - 2^d}, where a, b, c, d are non-negative integers. Without loss of generality, we can assume a > b and c > d. 2. For the expression to be an integer, the denominator 2^c - 2^d must divide the numerator 2^a - 2^b. We can factor both the numerator and the denominator: [ 2^a - 2^b = 2^b (2^{a-b} - 1) ] [ 2^c - 2^d = 2^d (2^{c-d} - 1) ] 3. For frac{2^a - 2^b}{2^c - 2^d} to be an integer, 2^d (2^{c-d} - 1) must divide 2^b (2^{a-b} - 1). This implies that 2^d must divide 2^b, which means d leq b. 4. Additionally, 2^{c-d} - 1 must divide 2^{a-b} - 1. This is a consequence of the fact that the non-power-of-2 factors of the numerator and the denominator must match.

Given that f(-1) = -1, we can find f(1) using the odd function property: 3. Using the fact that f is odd and f(-1)=-1, we get f(1) = -f(-1) = -(-1) = 1. Combining the periodicity and the property of the odd function, we conclude that: [ f(2008) = f(1) = 1 ] Thus, we have boxed{f(2008) = 1}."},{"prompt":"Given a complex number z satisfying frac {1z}{1+z}=i, find the conjugate of z.

A line l passing through the point (4,0) is tangent to circle M and intersects curve C at points A and B. Find the length of segment |AB|.","completion":"1. For circle M, the equation is (x+1)^2 + y^2 = 1, and for circle N, the equation is (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 9. Let the radius of the moving circle P be R. Since circle M is inside circle N, the moving circle can only be internally tangent to circle N and outside of circle M, which means R < 3. The moving circle P is externally tangent to circle M; thus, PM = 1 + R. The moving circle P is internally tangent to circle N; thus, PN = 3 - R. Therefore, PM + PN = 4, which means the sum of the distances from P to M and P to N is a constant. Hence, point P lies on an ellipse with foci M and N. Since the midpoint of the line segment MN is the origin, the center of the ellipse is at the origin. Therefore, 2a = 4, which gives a = 2. The distance between foci is 2c = MN = 2, which gives c = 1. Hence, b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 4 - 1 = 3. The equation of curve C is frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1 quad (x neq -2). 2. Let the equation of line l be y = k(x + 4). Let points A and B on curve C be (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2), respectively. Since line l is tangent to circle M, we have frac{|3k|}{sqrt{1+k^2}} = 1, which gives k = pm frac{sqrt{2}}{4}. For k = frac{sqrt{2}}{4}, substituting y = frac{sqrt{2}}{4}x + sqrt{2} into the equation of the ellipse and simplifying, we get 7x^2 + 8x - 8 = 0. From Vieta's formulas, we know that x_1 + x_2 = - frac{8}{7} and x_1 x_2 = - frac{8}{7}. Therefore, |AB| = sqrt{1+k^2} |x_1 - x_2| = frac{18}{7}. For k = -frac{sqrt{2}}{4}, by symmetry of the figure, we know that |AB| is the same, hence |AB| = frac{18}{7}.

For f(x) to have a decreasing interval, the inequality f'(x) < 0 must have a solution. Since e^{1-x} > 0 always holds true, we only need that a - (sin x + cos x) < 0 for some x. Thus, a must be less than the maximum value of sin x + cos x.

Furthermore, 2f'(x)cos(x+1) = -2e^{1-x}(sin x + cos x)cos(x+1), we therefore have f(-x-1) + 2f'(x)cos(x+1) = cos(x+1)left[e^{x+2} - 2e^{1-x}(sin x + cos x)right]. To show the original inequality holds, we need to prove that e^{x+2} - 2e^{1-x}(sin x + cos x) > 0, is valid for all x in left[ -1, frac{1}{2} right]. This simplifies to showing that e^{2x+1} > 2sqrt{2}sinleft(x + frac{pi}{4}right) for all x in left[ -1, frac{1}{2} right]. Define the function g(x) = 2x+2 - 2sqrt{2}sinleft(x + frac{pi}{4}right), for x in left[ -1, frac{1}{2} right]. Its derivative g'(x) = 2 - 2sqrt{2}cosleft(x + frac{pi}{4}right) = 2sqrt{2}left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - cosleft(x + frac{pi}{4}right)right). For x in [-1,0], g'(x) leq 0, thus g(x) is decreasing.

For x in left(-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}right], h'(x) > 0, so h(x) is increasing.

Let's analyze each case in detail: **Case 1: The digit to be crossed out is at the beginning of the number.** If the digit to be crossed out is at the beginning, then the number must be of the form x2012, where x is any digit from 1 to 9 (since it is a five-digit number and cannot start with 0).

Thus, no two liars can be neighbors. 2. **Configuration and Constraints**: - The 25 rooms form a 5 times 5 grid. - The liar cannot have another liar as a neighbor; thus, liars must be spread out, ensuring that no two liars are adjacent (neighboring rooms share a wall). 3. **Dividing the Grid**: - Consider coloring the grid in a checkerboard pattern: alternating black and white cells. This ensures that no two cells of the same color are adjacent. - For any 5 times 5 grid, the checkerboard pattern gives a way to place the liars and knights such that no two liars are neighbors. 4. **Counting the Maximum Liars**: - In our 5 times 5 grid, we will have 13 cells of one color and 12 cells of the other. - Let's say we color the corner cells black: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} hline text{B} & text{W} & text{B} & text{W} & text{B} hline text{W} & text{B} & text{W} & text{B} & text{W} hline text{B} & text{W} & text{B} & text{W} & text{B} hline text{W} & text{B} & text{W} & text{B} & text{W} hline text{B} & text{W} & text{B} & text{W} & text{B} hline end{array} ] - Here 'B' represents black cells and 'W' represents white cells.

Here, ( nu_q(x) ) denotes the highest power of ( q ) dividing ( x ). 2. **Prime factorization and congruence**: Note that ( q leq n ). Consider the product ((n+1)(n+2)cdots(n+k)). By the properties of ( nu_q ), we have: [ (n+1)(n+2)cdots(n+k) equiv k! pmod{q^{nu_q(k!)+1}} ] This follows because each term ( n+i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ) is congruent to some integer modulo ( q^{nu_q(k!)+1} ), and the product of these terms modulo ( q^{nu_q(k!)+1} ) is congruent to ( k! ). 3. **Implication on ( p )**: Given the above congruence, we have: [ frac{(n+1)(n+2)cdots(n+k)}{k!} equiv 1 pmod{q^{nu_q(k!)+1}} ] Therefore, [ p = frac{(n+1)(n+2)cdots(n+k)}{k!} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{q^{nu_q(k!)+1}} ] This implies ( q mid p ). Since ( p ) is prime, we must have ( p = q ). 4. **Bounding ( p )**: Now, consider the inequality: [ frac{(n+1)(n+2)cdots(n+k)}{k!} - 1 leq n ] This implies: [ frac{(n+1)(n+2)cdots(n+k)}{k!} leq n + 1 ] Since ( p ) is prime and ( p = q ), we have: [ q leq n + 1 ] 5. **Contradiction**: We also have: [ frac{(k+1)!}{2} leq (n+2)(n+3)cdots(n+k) leq k! ] This implies: [ frac{(k+1)!}{2} leq k! ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{k+1}{2} leq 1 implies k leq 1 ] This contradicts the assumption that ( k > 1 ). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our initial assumption that there exists a prime ( q ) such that ( nu_q(n) > nu_q(k!) ) must be false.

Thus, ( c = d ). 3. **Using the Circle Properties:** - Since the circle is inscribed in the trapezoid, the sum of the lengths of the bases is equal to the sum of the lengths of the legs: [ a + b = 2c ] 4. **Set Up Ratio Using ( k ):** [ a = kb ] Substituting ( a = kb ) into the equation ( a + b = 2c ): [ kb + b = 2c ] Factor out ( b ): [ b(k + 1) = 2c ] 5. **Solve for ( c ):** [ c = frac{b(k + 1)}{2} ] 6. **Finding the Angle Using Properties:** Recall that the angles in a trapezoid inscribed around a circle are related due to the cyclic nature of the shape. Each pair of opposite angles sum to ( pi ) radians (180 degrees). 7. **Trapezoid Symmetry and Bisector:** In an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonals are equal, and they create two congruent right triangles when they intersect. The angle at the base ( theta ) can be derived using the fact that the angles between the legs and the bases must match those summing with the corresponding angles. 8. **Using the Tangent Property:** - We will use the derived lengths and inscribed circle properties to find the tangent of the angle.

For the Vandermonde matrix ( V ), the column vectors are: [ (1, 1, ldots, 1), (z_1, z_2, ldots, z_n), (z_1^2, z_2^2, ldots, z_n^2), ldots, (z_1^{n-1}, z_2^{n-1}, ldots, z_n^{n-1}) ] The norm of the ( k )-th column vector is: [ left| (z_1^{k-1}, z_2^{k-1}, ldots, z_n^{k-1}) right| leq n times (0.99)^{k-1} ] Therefore, by Hadamard's inequality: [ |det(V)| leq prod_{k=1}^{n} left( n times (0.99)^{k-1} right) = n^n times (0.99)^{0 + 1 + 2 + ldots + (n-1)} = n^n times (0.99)^{frac{n(n-1)}{2}} ] 5. **Asymptotic Behavior:** As ( n ) goes to infinity, the term ( (0.99)^{frac{n(n-1)}{2}} ) approaches zero exponentially. Thus: [ n^n times (0.99)^{frac{n(n-1)}{2}} to 0 text{ as } n to infty ] Since ( |det(V)| ) must be a non-zero integer, this leads to a contradiction for sufficiently large ( n ). Therefore, there cannot exist a *good* polynomial for sufficiently large degree. (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Solve the equation [(a^{2},b^{2})+(a,bc)+(b,ac)+(c,ab)=199.] in positive integers. (Here (x,y) denotes the greatest common divisor of x and y .) *Proposed by S. Berlov*","completion":"1. **Prime Nature of 199**: First, note that (199) is a prime number. This is important because it implies that any divisor of (199) must be either (1) or (199) itself. 2. **Assumption and Contradiction**: Assume that ((a, b, c) = d > 1). This means that (d) is a common divisor of (a), (b), and (c). Since (d) is a common divisor, it must divide each term in the equation: [ d^2 mid (a^2, b^2), quad d mid (a, bc), quad d mid (b, ac), quad d mid (c, ab). ] Given that (d > 1) and (d mid 199), we conclude that (d = 199). However, substituting (d = 199) into the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation gives: [ text{LHS} geq 199^2 + 3 cdot 199 > 199. ] This is a contradiction because the LHS would be greater than (199). Therefore, ((a, b, c) = 1). 3. **Simplifying the GCD Terms**: We can simplify the terms involving the greatest common divisor (GCD): - ((a^2, b^2) = (a, b)^2). - ((a, bc) = (a, b) cdot (a, c)). This can be shown by letting ((b, c) = d), and writing (b = db_1) and (c = dc_1) where ((b_1, c_1) = 1). Since ((a, b, c) = 1), we have ((a, d) = 1). Thus, [ (a, bc) = (a, b_1c_1) = (a, b_1) cdot (a, c_1) = (a, b) cdot (a, c). ] - Similarly, ((b, ac) = (b, a) cdot (b, c)) and ((c, ab) = (c, a) cdot (c, b)). 4. **Combining the Terms**: Using the above simplifications, we can rewrite the LHS of the equation as: [ (a, b)^2 + (a, b) cdot (a, c) + (b, a) cdot (b, c) + (c, a) cdot (c, b). ] Since ((a, b) = (b, a)), ((a, c) = (c, a)), and ((b, c) = (c, b)), we can further simplify this to: [ (a, b)^2 + (a, b) cdot (a, c) + (a, b) cdot (b, c) + (a, c) cdot (b, c). ] Factoring, we get: [ ((a, b) + (a, c)) cdot ((a, b) + (b, c)) = 199. ] 5. **Prime Factorization**: Since (199) is a prime number, the only possible factorizations are (1 cdot 199) or (199 cdot 1). However, since ((a, b)), ((a, c)), and ((b, c)) are all at least (1), it is impossible for the product of two sums of these terms to equal (199). 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there are no positive integer solutions to the given equation.

We have the distance (60 meters) and the time (9.390553103577801 seconds), so we can use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Downstream speed = 60 m / 9.390553103577801 s ≈ 6.3924 m/s The downstream speed is the sum of the man's rowing speed in still water and the speed of the current.

Considering all stages, the total number of arrangements is 3 (ways to choose the person between A and B) times 2 (ways to arrange A and B) times 2!

Substituting -x into f(x) gives: [ f(-x) = frac{{2}^{-x} - 1}{1 + {2}^{-x}} = frac{1 - {2}^{x}}{{2}^{x} + 1} = -frac{{2}^{x} - 1}{{2}^{x} + 1} = -f(x) ] This confirms that f(x) is indeed an odd function.

By transforming f(x), we get: [ f(x) = 1 - frac{2}{1 + {2}^{x}} ] Since y = 1 + {2}^{x} is always increasing on R (as the exponential function 2^x is increasing), the term -frac{2}{1 + {2}^{x}} is decreasing but overall, f(x) is increasing because it starts from a baseline of 1 and goes down less rapidly than it would go up due to the increasing nature of 2^x.

To show the existence of the limit, it suffices to prove that the (limsup) and (liminf) of this sequence are equal: [ limsup_{n rightarrow +infty} frac{d(x, f^n(x))}{n} = liminf_{n rightarrow +infty} frac{d(x, f^n(x))}{n}. ] 3. **Fixing ( n_0 ) and Defining ( k_0 ):** Fix some ( n_0 ) and let ( k_0 = frac{d(x, f^{n_0}(x))}{n_0} ). We need to show that for any ( epsilon > 0 ), for sufficiently large ( n ), we have ( d(x, f^n(x)) < (k_0 + epsilon) n ). 4. **Using the Isometry Property:** Since ( f ) is an isometry, for any integer ( j ), we have: [ d(x, f^{j n_0}(x)) = j d(x, f^{n_0}(x)) = j n_0 k_0. ] This implies that: [ frac{d(x, f^{j n_0}(x))}{j n_0} = k_0. ] 5. **Generalizing to All ( n ):** For any ( n ), we can write ( n = j n_0 + r ) where ( 0 leq r < n_0 ).

Let's denote the points ( B(-6,0) ) and ( C(0,3) ) on the complex plane. The expression ( |z + 6| + |z - 3i| ) represents the sum of the distances from any point ( Z(x,y) ) on the ray to the points ( B ) and ( C ). 3. **Finding the Minimum Distance:** To find the maximum value of ( u ), we need to minimize ( |z + 6| + |z - 3i| ). The sum of distances from point ( Z ) on the ray ( AE ) to ( B ) and ( C ) is minimized when ( Z ) lies at the intersection of line ( BC ) and the ray ( AE ). 4. **Calculation of the Intersection:** The distance ( |BC| ) can be calculated using the distance formula between points ( B ) and ( C ): [ |BC| = sqrt{(-6 - 0)^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = sqrt{36 + 9} = sqrt{45} = 3sqrt{5} ] Hence, the minimum value of ( |z + 6| + |z - 3i| ) is ( 3sqrt{5} ). 5. **Calculation of ( u ):** Since we want to maximize ( u ) where ( u = frac{1}{|z + 6| + |z - 3i|} ), substituting the minimum value: [ u_{text{max}} = frac{1}{3sqrt{5}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{15} ] 6. **Finding the Coordinates of ( z ):** The point ( Z ) which minimizes ( |z + 6| + |z - 3i| ) and lies on the intersection of ( BC ) and the ray ( AE ).

Consider the product ( prod_{i=1}^{2015} (a_i - b_i) = 2017^{2016} ). 3. Since (2017 = 2 times 1008 + 1), it follows that 2017 is an odd number.

They worked together for 6 days, so the amount of work they completed together is: ( 6 times frac{7}{60} = frac{42}{60} = frac{7}{10} ) of the work. This means that ( frac{3}{10} ) of the work is still remaining when B is replaced by C. Now, A and C finish the remaining work in 5 days. Since A's work rate is ( frac{1}{20} ) of the work per day, in 5 days A will complete: ( 5 times frac{1}{20} = frac{5}{20} = frac{1}{4} ) of the work. Since ( frac{3}{10} ) of the work was remaining and A did ( frac{1}{4} ) of the work in those 5 days, C must have done the rest of the work, which is: ( frac{3}{10} - frac{1}{4} = frac{6}{20} - frac{5}{20} = frac{1}{20} ) of the work in 5 days.

This implies ( n ) must be even. 3. **Case Analysis:** - **Case ( n = 4 ):** - If ( n = 4 ), each member has exactly 3 enemies. This means every member is an enemy to every other member. This forms a complete graph ( K_4 ) where every member is an enemy to every other member. - This satisfies the condition that each member has exactly 3 enemies. - **Case ( n = 6 ):** - If ( n = 6 ), we need to check if we can partition the members into groups such that each member has exactly 3 enemies. - One possible partition is to split the 6 members into two groups of 3, where each member in one group is an enemy to every member in the other group.

Prove that: (1) Regardless of the initial number of pieces of each color, it is always possible to repaint all pieces to a single color through a finite number of operations. (2) The final color does not depend on the order of the operations.","completion":"We are given a problem involving 2005 glass pieces, each painted one of three colors: red, yellow, or blue. The operations involve wiping two pieces of different colors clean and then painting them the third color. We need to prove the following two statements: 1. No matter the initial distribution of the red, yellow, and blue pieces, it is always possible through a finite number of operations to make all the pieces the same color. 2. The final color does not depend on the order of operations. To solve this, let's proceed step-by-step. Statement 1: Achieving Uniform Color 1. **Representation of Glass Piece Counts**: Let's denote the number of red, yellow, and blue pieces as ( x ), ( y ), and ( z ) respectively. We know: [ x + y + z = 2005 ] Since 2005 ≡ 1 (mod 3), it implies that ( x + y + z ≡ 1 ) (mod 3). 2. **Modular Arithmetic Constraints**: Let’s examine the residues of ( x, y, z ) modulo 3. We can observe that regardless of their initial values, ( x, y, z ) mod 3 will always fulfill: [ x equiv 1, y equiv 0, z equiv 2 quad (text{or any permutations that sum to 1 modulo 3}) ] This is because permutations that sum to 1 modulo 3 can only change through the operations defined. 3. **Operation Analysis**: When we perform the operation (choosing two pieces of different colors and painting them the third color), notice the changes: - Suppose we pick one red and one yellow piece, and paint them blue. This would decrease ( x ) by 1, decrease ( y) by 1, and increase ( z ) by 2. - Representation: ( x' = x - 1 ), ( y' = y - 1 ), ( z' = z + 2 ). These operations preserve ( x + y + z equiv 1 ) (mod 3). 4. **Concrete Example**: Assume the counts of each color as: [ x = 3a + m, quad y = 3b + n, quad z = 3c + p, quad m, n, p in {0, 1, 2} ] Since ( x + y + z equiv 1 ) (mod 3) and the residue only alters within the same family. 5. **Operation Sequence for Uniformity**: [ begin{aligned} (3a + m, 3b + n, 3c + n) & rightarrow (3(a+2b)+m+2n, 0, 3(c-b)): & & (text{Pairing and converting}) & rightarrow (3(a+2b)+m+2n-1, 2, 3(c-b)-1) & rightarrow (3(a+2b+1)+m+2n, 0, 3(c-b-1)) & rightarrow (3(a+2b+2)+m+2n, 0, 3(c-b-2)) & rightarrow cdots & rightarrow (3(a+b+c)+m+2n, 0, 0) end{aligned} ] This sequence indicates continuous reduction until only ( x ) remains. 6. **Conclusion of Statement 1**: These operations show that eventually, all glass pieces can convert to the same color via the operations defined. Statement 2: Final Color Independence 1. **Structure Invariance**: The operation ( x + y + z ≡ 1 ) (mod 3) means that the colors' transformation invariance holds regardless of the operation sequence. 2. **Final Configuration**: Since: [ x', y', z' = 0, 0, 2005 quad or quad 0, 2005, 0 quad or quad 2005, 0, 0 ] This implies the final color is always the remaining color, and due to initial total, red dominates: [ 2005 equiv 1 quad (text{mod 3}) ] 3. **Final Color**: Hence, regardless of the initial configuration or order of operations, final uniform color would be red. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Red}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=2sin^{2}left( frac{π}{4}+xright) sqrt{3}cos 2x, (1) Find the smallest positive period and the monotonic intervals of f(x).

This can be expressed using the formula for the probability of ( k ) successes in ( n ) Bernoulli trials: [ P(X = k) = binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} ] where (binom{n}{k}) is the binomial coefficient, ( p ) is the probability of success, and ( n ) is the number of trials. 4. Here, ( n = 7 ), ( k = 7 ), and ( p = frac{2}{7} ). 5. Plugging these values into the formula, we have: [ P(X = 7) = binom{7}{7} left(frac{2}{7}right)^7 left(1 - frac{2}{7}right)^{7-7} ] 6. Simplifying further: [ binom{7}{7} = 1, quad left(frac{2}{7}right)^7 = frac{128}{823543}, quad text{and} quad left(frac{5}{7}right)^0 = 1 ] Therefore: [ P(7 text{ successes}) = 1 times frac{128}{823543} times 1 = frac{128}{823543} ] 7. Converting the probability to a decimal form: [ frac{128}{823543} approx 0.00016 ] # Conclusion The probability that the blue section will be knocked down in all 7 days is approximately ( 0.00016 ).

A's work rate is ( frac{1}{10} ) of the work per day, since A can finish the work in 10 days. B's work rate is ( frac{1}{B} ) of the work per day. When A and B work together, their combined work rate is ( frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{B} ) of the work per day. The fraction of the work that A does when working together with B is the ratio of A's work rate to their combined work rate, which is: [ frac{frac{1}{10}}{frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{B}} ] According to the problem, A gets Rs. 1800 out of the total wages of Rs. 3000 when they work together, which means A does ( frac{1800}{3000} = frac{3}{5} ) of the work.

From equation 1: 3 / (x * p) = 8 => p = 3 / (8 * x) From equation 2: 5 / (y * q) = 18 => q = 5 / (18 * y) Now, we need to find the minimum values of x and y such that x * p and y * q are integers. Since p and q are also integers, we need to find the smallest x and y that make 3 / (8 * x) and 5 / (18 * y) integers. For 3 / (8 * x) to be an integer, 8 * x must be a divisor of 3. The smallest positive integer x that satisfies this condition is x = 1, because 8 * 1 = 8, and 3 is not divisible by 8. However, if we choose x = 3, then 8 * 3 = 24, and 3 is divisible by 24. So the smallest x that makes p an integer is x = 3. For 5 / (18 * y) to be an integer, 18 * y must be a divisor of 5. The smallest positive integer y that satisfies this condition is y = 1, because 18 * 1 = 18, and 5 is not divisible by 18. However, if we choose y = 5, then 18 * 5 = 90, and 5 is divisible by 90. So the smallest y that makes q an integer is y = 5. Now we can find the values of p and q: p = 3 / (8 * x) = 3 / (8 * 3) = 3 / 24 = 1/8 q = 5 / (18 * y) = 5 / (18 * 5) = 5 / 90 = 1/18 Since p and q must be integers, we need to find the smallest integer values for p and q. The smallest integer value for p is 1 (when x = 3), and the smallest integer value for q is 1 (when y = 5). Now we can find p - q: p - q = 1 - 1 = 0 Therefore, the value of p - q when x and y are minimized is boxed{0} ."},{"prompt":"An assembly line produces some cogs per hour until an initial order of 60 cogs is completed.

Therefore, we can write the following equation for the first part of the production: [ x cdot t = 60 ] Now, since the second part of the production is at a rate of 60 cogs per hour, and another 60 cogs are produced, we can say that it takes 1 hour to produce the second batch of 60 cogs. The total time for the production of 120 cogs is ( t + 1 ) hours, and the total number of cogs produced is 120. The overall average output is given as 24 cogs per hour.

Hence, ( f(x) + 2019 = f(f(f(x))) = f(x + 2019) ). - This implies that if ( x equiv y pmod{2019} ), then ( f(x) equiv f(y) pmod{2019} ), establishing that ( g ) is well-defined. 2. **Examining ( g )**: - Given ( g(n) = f(n bmod 2019) bmod 2019 ), we infer ( g(g(n)) = f(f(n bmod 2019)) bmod 2019 = (n bmod 2019 + 2019) bmod 2019 = n bmod 2019 ). - Therefore, ( g ) is an involution (i.e., ( g(g(n)) = n )). 3. **Finding a Fixed Point of ( g )**: - Since ( mathbb{Z}_{2019} ) has an odd cardinality (2019 elements), every involution on a set with an odd number of elements has at least one fixed point. - Let ( bar{p} in mathbb{Z}_{2019} ) be a fixed point of ( g ), meaning ( g(bar{p}) = bar{p} ). - This implies that there exists an integer ( p in mathbb{N} ) such that ( p mod 2019 = bar{p} mod 2019 ). - Therefore, ( f(p) = p + 2019k ) for some integer ( k ). 4. **Contradiction and Conclusion**: - Given ( f(f(p)) = p + 2019 ) and ( f(f(p)) = f(p + 2019k) ): [ f(f(p)) = p + 2019 = f(p + 2019k) = f(p) + 2019k ] - By iterating the equation ( f(x + 2019) = f(x) + 2019 ), we get: [ f(f(p)) = f(p + 2019k) = f(p) + 2019k = p + 2019k + 2019k = p + 2 cdot 2019k ] - Thus: [ p + 2019 = p + 2 cdot 2019k Rightarrow 2019 = 2 cdot 2019k Rightarrow k = frac{1}{2} ] - This is a contradiction since ( k in mathbb{N} ).

Each coefficient ( binom{k+1}{h} ) is the sum of two coefficients from row ( k ). - If both coefficients from row ( k ) are odd, their sum is even. - If one coefficient is odd and the other is even, their sum is odd. - If both coefficients are even, their sum is even. 7. **Counting Odd Coefficients:** - The number of odd coefficients in row ( k+1 ) is determined by the positions of the odd coefficients in row ( k ). - Since the number of odd coefficients in row ( k ) is ( 2^m ), and each odd coefficient in row ( k ) contributes to exactly one odd coefficient in row ( k+1 ), the number of odd coefficients in row ( k+1 ) is ( 2^{m+1} ). 8. **Conclusion:** - By induction, the number of odd binomial coefficients in row ( n ) of Pascal's Triangle is a power of 2 for any positive integer ( n ).

However, the standard solution suggests that |2+3a|=1, which is a correction to the initial reasoning, indicating that the expression inside the absolute value must result in the equation being linear in terms of a after simplification. Following the corrected approach: 1. We start with the given inequality: 2a-x^{|2+3a|} gt 2 2. Since the inequality is linear in terms of x, and considering the correction, we set the absolute value equal to 1 to maintain the linearity in terms of a: |2+3a| = 1 3. Solving the absolute value equation gives us two cases: - When 2+3a = 1, solving for a gives: 2+3a = 1 Rightarrow 3a = -1 Rightarrow a = -frac{1}{3} - When 2+3a = -1, solving for a gives: 2+3a = -1 Rightarrow 3a = -3 Rightarrow a = -1 Therefore, the possible values for a are -frac{1}{3} or -1.

According to the first statement, the price of 2 sarees and 4 shirts is: 2S + 4T According to the second statement, the price of 1 saree and 6 shirts is the same as the price of 2 sarees and 4 shirts: S + 6T = 2S + 4T From the third statement, the price of 12 shirts is 2400: 12T = 2400 Now, let's solve for T: T = 2400 / 12 T = 200 Now we have the price of one shirt, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find the price of one saree: S + 6(200) = 2S + 4(200) S + 1200 = 2S + 800 1200 - 800 = 2S - S 400 = S Now we have the price of one saree (S = 400) and one shirt (T = 200), we can find the cost of 2 sarees and 4 shirts: 2S + 4T = 2(400) + 4(200) 2S + 4T = 800 + 800 2S + 4T = 1600 Therefore, the cost of 2 sarees and 4 shirts is boxed{1600} ."},{"prompt":"Find the remainder when (1^{2} + 3^{2} + 5^{2} + cdots + 99^{2}) is divided by 1000.","completion":"1. We are asked to find the remainder when the sum ( S = 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 + cdots + 99^2 ) is divided by 1000. 2. Observe that the sequence ( 1, 3, 5, ldots, 99 ) is an arithmetic sequence with the first term ( a = 1 ) and common difference ( d = 2 ). The ( n )-th term can be written as: [ a_n = 1 + (n-1) cdot 2 = 2n - 1 ] 3. Therefore, ( S ) can be written as: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{50} (2i-1)^2 ] where the summation goes from ( i = 1 ) to ( i = 50 ), since there are 50 odd numbers between 1 and 99. 4. Expanding the square inside the sum, we get: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{50} (2i-1)^2 = sum_{i=1}^{50} left(4i^2 - 4i + 1right) ] 5. The summation can then be separated into three different sums: [ S = 4 sum_{i=1}^{50} i^2 - 4 sum_{i=1}^{50} i + sum_{i=1}^{50} 1 ] 6.

According to the given rules, we need to color each chip either red or blue. We know that chip 5 is blue. 2. Let's analyze the rules for coloring: a) If the chips numbered (x) and (y) are of different colors, then the chip numbered (|x-y|) is painted red. b) If the chips numbered (x) and (y) are of different colors and (x cdot y) is a number between 1 and 50 (inclusive), then the chip numbered (x cdot y) is painted blue. 3. Next, observe that any two numbers differing by 5 will have the same color. - If two numbers (x) and (x+5) were of different colors, then according to rule (a), the chip numbered (|x - (x+5)| = 5) would need to be red. But we know chip 5 is blue, which is a contradiction. - Therefore, numbers differing by 5 must be the same color. 4. Given that we only need to determine the colors of the first four chips (1, 2, 3, 4) because all other chips will follow by the rule that numbers differing by 5 have the same color. 5. We consider two cases based on the color of chip 1: - **Case 1**: Chip 1 is blue. - If chip 1 is blue, then using rule (b), we can see that all other numbers must also be blue. - If any chip (k neq 1) were red, then (k cdot 1 = k) should be blue (rule (b)), leading to a contradiction since (k) was assumed red. - Thus, all chips must be blue. - **Case 2**: Chip 1 is red. - By rule (a), the chip numbered (5-1=4) must be red (as chips 1 and 5 are different colors). - To determine the color of chips 2 and 3, we assume chip 3 is blue: - Then (2 = 3 - 1) must be red, as 3 and 1 are different colors. - But (3) and (5-2=3) should have different colors, as this leads to 3 being red (contradicting our assumption that 3 is blue). Thus, chip 3 cannot be blue. - Therefore, chip 3 is red, and by analogous reasoning, so is chip 2. 6. Conclusion: - When chip 1 is blue, all chips are blue: ({1, 2, ldots, 50}). - When chip 1 is red, chips ({1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, ldots }) are all red and multiples of 5 are blue. 7.

Since AA' and BB' are altitudes, angle CAA' = angle CBB' = 30^circ. This is because angle C = 60^circ and the angles in a triangle sum up to 180^circ. Therefore, angle A + angle B = 120^circ. Since AA' and BB' are altitudes, they form right angles with BC and AC respectively, making angle CAA' = 90^circ - angle A and angle CBB' = 90^circ - angle B.

This means it shifts by one square in one direction (either horizontally or vertically) and then three squares in the perpendicular direction. This move can be visualized as follows: - Move 1 square up/down/left/right. - Then move 3 squares perpendicular to the initial move direction. 2. **Step 2: Considering the Checkerboard Coloring** Consider the 10 times 10 board colored like a chessboard with alternating black and white squares. This means no two adjacent squares are of the same color. 3. **Step 3: Examining the Effect of Camel's Move on Color** Let's analyze the camel's move from a generically placed initial square. - The board can be represented as a set of coordinates (i, j) for row i and column j. - The color of the square (i, j) is determined by (i + j) mod 2: - (i + j) mod 2 = 0 (Black square) - (i + j) mod 2 = 1 (White square) When the camel moves: - New coordinate (i', j') given by: - Move 1: (i+1, j+3) or (i-1, j+3) or (i+1, j-3) or (i-1, j-3) - Move 2: (i+3, j+1) or (i-3, j+1) or (i+3, j-1) or (i-3, j-1) 4. **Step 4: Calculating the Color Invariance** Evaluate the color of the destination field (i', j'): - The total parity of each move's coordinates sum: - (i+1) + (j+3) = i + j + 4 which is (i + j) mod 2 - (i-1) + (j+3) = i + j + 2 which is (i + j + 2) mod 2 - (i+1) + (j-3) = i + j - 2 which is (i + j - 2) mod 2 - (i-1) + (j-3) = i + j - 4 which is (i + j) mod 2 - (i+3) + (j+1) = i + j + 4 which is (i + j) mod 2 - (i-3) + (j+1) = i + j - 2 which is (i + j - 2) mod 2 - (i+3) + (j-1) = i + j + 2 which is (i + j + 2) mod 2 - (i-3) + (j-1) = i + j - 4 which is (i + j) mod 2 In each case, the parity (color) does not change. Therefore, each of these moves preserves the invariant property of staying on the same color field. 5. **Step 5: Concluding Impossibility of Moving to Adjacent Field** Since the colors of the two adjacent fields differ, it is impossible for the camel to move from one field to a field of different color. Each of the camel's (1,3) moves maintains the same invariant color, and as a result, it cannot transition directly to a neighboring field of the opposite color. # Conclusion Given that each adjacent square has a different color and the camel's movement preserves the color (from step 4), it is concluded that: textbf{Impossible to move from a starting field to an adjacent field of different color with the camel move} [ boxed{text{Impossible}} ]"},{"prompt":"A restaurant makes 40 more cheese pizzas than hot dogs every day and also prepares pepperoni pizzas which are twice the number of cheese pizzas.

There are 20 students in total. Two students scored 100 each, and three students scored 0 each, so there are 20 - 2 - 3 = 15 students left. The total marks for the class can be calculated by adding the marks of all the students together. We know the average of the whole class is 40, so the total marks for the class is 20 students * 40 marks/student = 800 marks. Now, we can calculate the total marks for the 15 students who are left. We have 2 students who scored 100 each, which adds up to 2 * 100 = 200 marks. We also have 3 students who scored 0 each, which adds up to 3 * 0 = 0 marks. The total marks for the 15 students is the total marks for the class minus the marks of the 2 students who scored 100 and the 3 students who scored 0: Total marks for the 15 students = Total marks for the class - (Marks of the 2 students who scored 100 + Marks of the 3 students who scored 0) Total marks for the 15 students = 800 - (200 + 0) Total marks for the 15 students = 800 - 200 Total marks for the 15 students = 600 Now, we can find the average for these 15 students by dividing the total marks by the number of students: Average for the 15 students = Total marks for the 15 students / Number of students Average for the 15 students = 600 / 15 Average for the 15 students = 40 So, the average of the rest of the students is boxed{40} ."},{"prompt":"Given a positive geometric sequence {a_n}, where a_1 + a_5 = 34 and a_2a_4 = 64, find the sum of the first n terms S_n.","completion":"Denote the common ratio of the positive geometric sequence {a_n} as q > 0.

Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of the factorial. The number of 2s in a factorial will always be greater than the number of 5s, so the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of 5s. Let's first find the number of trailing zeroes in 70! and 140! separately. For 70!: The number of 5s in 70! is calculated by dividing 70 by 5 and then dividing the quotient by 5 again, continuing this process until the quotient is less than 5. 70 ÷ 5 = 14 (14 factors of 5) 14 ÷ 5 = 2 (2 factors of 25, which contribute an extra factor of 5 each) So, the total number of factors of 5 in 70! is 14 + 2 = 16. For 140!: The number of 5s in 140! is calculated similarly: 140 ÷ 5 = 28 (28 factors of 5) 28 ÷ 5 = 5 (5 factors of 25, which contribute an extra factor of 5 each) 5 ÷ 5 = 1 (1 factor of 125, which contributes two extra factors of 5) So, the total number of factors of 5 in 140! is 28 + 5 + 1 = 34. Now, let's consider the expression n = 70! + 140!. The number of trailing zeroes in this expression will be determined by the term with the least number of trailing zeroes, since adding any number to a number with x trailing zeroes cannot increase the number of trailing zeroes beyond x. Since 70! has 16 trailing zeroes and 140! has 34 trailing zeroes, the number of trailing zeroes in n = boxed{70!} + 140! will be the same as the number of trailing zeroes in 70!, which is 16."},{"prompt":"the positive geometric sequence {a_n}, let S_n denote the sum of its first n terms.

Instead of directly calculating the number of ways to select books that include at least one paperback, we can calculate the number of ways to select books that include no paperbacks and subtract that from the total number of possible selections. First, let's calculate the total number of possible selections of books from the shelf. Since there are 7 books on the shelf, and we can select any number of books from 0 to 7, the total number of possible selections is the sum of the combinations of 7 books taken 0 at a time, 1 at a time, up to 7 at a time. This is equivalent to 2^7 (since each book can either be selected or not selected), which is 128. Now, let's calculate the number of ways to select books that include no paperbacks.

Mass of Ba in the mixture = (x / 175.323 g/mol) × 137.327 g/mol + (y / 153.326 g/mol) × 137.327 g/mol The mass of F in BaF2 is the molar mass of F times the number of moles of BaF2, which is x / molar mass of BaF2. Mass of F in the mixture = (x / 175.323 g/mol) × (2 × 18.998 g/mol) The mass of O in BaO is the molar mass of O times the number of moles of BaO, which is y / molar mass of BaO. Mass of O in the mixture = (y / 153.326 g/mol) × 15.999 g/mol Now, we can calculate the mass percentages: Mass percentage of Ba = (Mass of Ba in the mixture / (x + y)) × 100% Mass percentage of F = (Mass of F in the mixture / (x + y)) × 100% Mass percentage of O = (Mass of O in the mixture / (x + y)) × 100% Without the specific values for x and y, we cannot calculate the exact mass percentages.

According to Vieta's formulas: [ x_A + x_B = 2x_0 ] [ x_A x_B = -2(x_0 + 2) ] 5. **Distance Calculation:** The distance ( |AB| ) can be calculated as follows, using the distance formula between the roots: [ |AB| = sqrt{1 + x_0^2} cdot |x_A - x_B| ] Finding ( |x_A - x_B| ): [ |x_A - x_B| = sqrt{(x_A + x_B)^2 - 4x_A x_B} = sqrt{(2x_0)^2 - 4(-2(x_0 + 2))} = sqrt{4x_0^2 + 8x_0 + 16} ] Simplify further: [ |x_A - x_B| = 2sqrt{x_0^2 + 2x_0 + 4} ] Therefore, we have: [ |AB| = 2 sqrt{1 + x_0^2} sqrt{x_0^2 + 2x_0 + 4} ] 6. **Calculating the Perpendicular Distance from ( P ) to ( AB ):** The distance from ( P ) to the line ( AB ) is given by: [ d = frac{|x_0^2 - (-x_0 - 2) + x_0 + 2|}{sqrt{1 + x_0^2}} = frac{|x_0^2 + 2x_0 + 4|}{sqrt{1 + x_0^2}} ] 7. **Area of (triangle PAB):** [ S_{triangle PAB} = frac{1}{2} cdot |AB| cdot d = frac{1}{2} cdot 2 sqrt{1 + x_0^2} sqrt{x_0^2 + 2x_0 + 4} cdot frac{|x_0^2 + 2x_0 + 4|}{sqrt{1 + x_0^2}} ] Simplifying the expression: [ S_{triangle PAB} = left((x_0 + 1)^2 + 3right)^{frac{3}{2}} ] Evaluating the minimum value, we find: [ S_{triangle PAB} geq 3 sqrt{3} ] 8. **Special Case Analysis:** When ( x_0 = -1 ): [ P = (-1, -1) ] This confirms that the minimum area is obtained when ( x_0 = -1 ).

Symbolically, this is ( A_G implies B_B ). - If A is bad, ( A_G ) (A being good) is false, making the entire implication true (because a statement with a false antecedent is always true in classical logic). Thus, A's statement: - If A were bad (false), the implication ( A_G implies B_B ) would be true no matter what. - This contradicts A being bad because a bad person would be lying, which means they couldn't make a true statement. Hence, **the assumption that A is bad must be false**. Therefore, A is good. 2. **Since we have established A is good,** let's analyze A's statement again: - A's statement must be true since A is good: \\"If I am good, then B is bad.\\" - This simplifies to ( A_G implies B_B ). Given ( A_G ) is true, it follows ( B_B ) must be true as well. Hence, B is bad. 3. **Now, analyze B's statement: \\"If I am a boy, then A is a girl.\\"** - Symbolically: ( text{B says: } B_B implies A_L ). - Knowing B is bad (and hence lies), B’s statement must be false. To break down the falsehood of ( B_B implies A_L ): - ( B_B ) being true (B is a boy) and ( A_L ) being false (A is not a girl) would make the entire implication ( B_B implies A_L ) false. Thus, if B were telling the truth (which we know B isn't), then ( B_B implies A_L ) would equate A to being a girl. Given B lies, the reverse must hold. 4. **Since A is not a girl**, A is a boy. **Conclusion**: - ( A ) is good and a boy. - ( B ) is bad and a boy.
