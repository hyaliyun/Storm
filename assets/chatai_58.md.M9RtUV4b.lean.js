Since the absolute value function does not affect the periodicity, ( |sin x | ) inherits the same period, i.e., ( 2pi ). Thus, ( | sin x | ) is periodic. [ | sin(x + 2pi) | = | sin x | ] - **Odd Function:** A function (f(x)) is classified as odd if (f(-x) = -f(x)). For ( | sin x | ): [ | sin(-x) | = | -sin x | = | sin x | ] Therefore, ( | sin x | ) is not an odd function, hence (A) cannot be the right choice. 2. **Analyzing ( left| log_2 x right| ):** - **Periodicity:** The logarithmic function (log_2 x) is not a periodic function. It does not repeat itself over any interval. - **Odd Function:** [ left| log_2(-x) right| ] Because (log_2 x) is only defined for positive (x), this function is not defined for all (x), and not periodic either.

However, since ( S subseteq {1, 2, ldots, 2024} ), the maximum number of distinct elements in ( S ) is ( 2024 ). 5. **Contradiction**: The assumption that ( S_1 ), ( S_2 ), and ( S_3 ) are pairwise disjoint leads to a contradiction because ( 2100 ) elements cannot fit into the range of ( 2024 ) numbers: [ 2100 nleq 2024 ] Therefore, at least one pair of sets must intersect: [ S_1 cap S_2 neq emptyset, quad S_2 cap S_3 neq emptyset, quad text{or} quad S_1 cap S_3 neq emptyset ] 6. **Conclusion**: If ( S_1 cap S_2 neq emptyset ), there exist ( n_i, n_j in S_1 ) such that ( n_i + 3 = n_j ). Therefore, ( n_j - n_i = 3 ). If ( S_2 cap S_3 neq emptyset ), there exist ( n_i, n_j in S_1 ) such that ( n_i + 7 = n_j ). Therefore, ( n_j - n_i = 7 ).

Since one-third of the employees are men, this means that two-thirds are women. Number of women employees = 2/3 * Total number of employees Number of women employees = 2/3 * 3300 Number of women employees = 2200 Now, we know that out of these women, 1200 are not mothers. So, the number of women who are mothers is: Number of women who are mothers = Total number of women employees - Number of women who are not mothers Number of women who are mothers = 2200 - 1200 Number of women who are mothers = 1000 Each mother received a bonus of 1250. To find the total bonus amount given to all the mothers, we multiply the number of mothers by the bonus each received: Total bonus for mothers = Number of women who are mothers * Bonus per mother Total bonus for mothers = 1000 * 1250 Total bonus for mothers = 1,250,000 Now, to find the percentage of Facebook's annual earnings that was allocated for the productivity bonus, we divide the total bonus by the annual earnings and multiply by 100: Percentage of annual earnings = (Total bonus for mothers / Annual earnings) * 100 Percentage of annual earnings = (1,250,000 / 5,000,000) * 100 Percentage of annual earnings = 0.25 * 100 Percentage of annual earnings = 25% Therefore, boxed{25%} of Facebook's annual earnings was allocated for the productivity bonus for female employees who are mothers."},{"prompt":"Given (p(x): x^{2}+2xm > 0), and (p(1)) is false, (p(2)) is true, then the range of the real number (m) is ______.","completion":"Since (p(1)) is false, we have (1^{2}+2cdot1-m leqslant 0), which gives (m geqslant 3).

By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots r + s = -b/a = -1 and the product of the roots rs = c/a. Since a = b = r, we have: - r + s = -1 - rs = c/r From rs = c/r, we get r^2s = c. If c = 0, then r^2s = 0. Since s neq r, r neq 0, so s = 0. Then r + s = r = -1, giving r = -1 and s = 0. The polynomial is -x^2 - x = 0, which has roots 0 and -1. This is a valid solution. If c neq 0, then r^2 = 1 (since r^2s = c and s neq 0), so r = pm 1. If r = 1, then s = -2 (since r + s = -1), and the polynomial is x^2 + x - 2 = 0, which has roots 1 and -2.

What fraction of the profit did B receive?","completion":"To determine the fraction of the profit B received, we need to know the ratio of A's contribution to B's contribution. Since we only know A's fraction of the capital and the time periods for both A and B, we can calculate their respective shares based on the product of the capital contributed and the time for which it was used. Let's assume the total capital is C. Then A's contribution is (1/4)C and B's contribution is the remaining capital, which is C - (1/4)C = (3/4)C. Now, we calculate the share of each partner based on the time their money was used in the business: A's share = A's capital contribution × time = (1/4)C × 15 months B's share = B's capital contribution × time = (3/4)C × 10 months To find the ratio of their shares, we divide A's share by B's share: A's share / B's share = [(1/4)C × 15] / [(3/4)C × 10] We can simplify this by canceling out the common factor C: = [(1/4) × 15] / [(3/4) × 10] Now, we simplify the fractions: = (15/4) / (30/4) The 4s cancel out: = 15 / 30 This simplifies to: = 1 / 2 This means that A's share is half of B's share. Since the total profit is divided between A and B, and A's share is half of B's, the total profit can be thought of as being divided into three equal parts: two parts for B and one part for A.

Since f and g are differentiable functions from I to J and satisfy f' = varphi circ f and g' = varphi circ g, we can apply the chain rule to F circ f and F circ g: [ (F circ f)'(x) = F'(f(x)) cdot f'(x) = frac{1}{varphi(f(x))} cdot varphi(f(x)) = 1 ] Similarly, [ (F circ g)'(x) = F'(g(x)) cdot g'(x) = frac{1}{varphi(g(x))} cdot varphi(g(x)) = 1 ] 3. Since the derivatives of F circ f and F circ g are both 1, it follows that F circ f and F circ g are linear functions of x.

Since a = b, we have: [ F(f(x)) = x + a quad text{and} quad F(g(x)) = x + a ] Therefore, F(f(x)) = F(g(x)) for all x in I. 6. Because F is the antiderivative of 1/varphi and varphi does not vanish, F' does not vanish. This implies that F is strictly monotonic and hence injective. Since F is injective, F(f(x)) = F(g(x)) implies f(x) = g(x) for all x in I. 7.

It takes him a certain amount of time to row upstream and downstream. The rate of the current is 1.5 km/hr.

When the man is rowing upstream, the effective speed (Vu) is the speed of the man minus the speed of the current because the current is working against him. So, Vu = Vm - Vc = 4.5 km/hr - 1.5 km/hr = 3 km/hr. When the man is rowing downstream, the effective speed (Vd) is the speed of the man plus the speed of the current because the current is helping him. So, Vd = Vm + Vc = 4.5 km/hr + 1.5 km/hr = 6 km/hr. Let's assume the man rows a certain distance D (the same distance upstream and downstream). The time it takes to row upstream (Tu) is the distance divided by the upstream speed, so Tu = D / Vu. The time it takes to row downstream (Td) is the distance divided by the downstream speed, so Td = D / Vd. Now, let's find the ratio of the time taken to row upstream to the time taken to row downstream: Ratio = Tu / Td = (D / Vu) / (D / Vd) = (D / (Vm - Vc)) / (D / (Vm + Vc)) = (D / 3 km/hr) / (D / 6 km/hr) = (D * 6 km/hr) / (D * 3 km/hr) = 6 / 3 = 2 / 1 Therefore, the ratio of the time it takes him to row upstream to the time it takes him to row downstream is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"The polynomial x^4 ax^3 + bx^2 cx + 2520 has four positive integer roots.

How many parrots does he have?","completion":"First, let's calculate the daily birdseed consumption for each type of bird: - Each parakeet eats 2 grams a day, so 3 parakeets eat 3 * 2 = 6 grams a day. - Each finch eats half of what a parakeet eats, so each finch eats 2 / 2 = 1 gram a day. Therefore, 4 finches eat 4 * 1 = 4 grams a day. Now, let's calculate the total daily consumption for the parakeets and finches: Total daily consumption for parakeets and finches = 6 grams (parakeets) + 4 grams (finches) = 10 grams a day. Since Peter needs to buy birdseed to last a week (7 days), let's calculate the weekly consumption for the parakeets and finches: Weekly consumption for parakeets and finches = 10 grams/day * 7 days = 70 grams/week. Now we know that Peter needs to buy 266 grams of birdseed in total for the week, and we've calculated that the parakeets and finches will consume 70 grams of that total. So, the remaining birdseed for the parrots is: Birdseed for parrots = Total birdseed needed - Birdseed for parakeets and finches = 266 grams - 70 grams = 196 grams. Since each parrot eats 14 grams a day, the weekly consumption for one parrot is: Weekly consumption for one parrot = 14 grams/day * 7 days = 98 grams/week. Now we can calculate the number of parrots Peter has by dividing the total weekly birdseed for parrots by the weekly consumption for one parrot: Number of parrots = Birdseed for parrots / Weekly consumption for one parrot = 196 grams / 98 grams/week = 2 parrots.

When it's raining, Ken can cycle 30 miles in 20 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in one hour, he would be able to cycle: ( frac{60}{20} times 30 = 3 times 30 = 90 ) miles per hour. When it's snowing, Ken can cycle 10 miles in 20 minutes. So in one hour, he would be able to cycle: ( frac{60}{20} times 10 = 3 times 10 = 30 ) miles per hour. Ken cycles 1 hour a day.

Let's analyze the statements one by one: 1. **Monotonicity on Different Intervals:** Since f(x) is even, it mirrors its behavior on the negative side to the positive side. Therefore, if it is increasing on [-1,0], it must be decreasing on [0,1] due to the symmetry of even functions. This is because, for an even function, f(-x) = f(x), and an increase in the negative direction implies a decrease in the positive direction over the same magnitude of intervals centered around zero. - f(x) is monotonically increasing on [-1,0]. - Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on [0,1]. 2. **Symmetry About the Point (1,0):** The given equation f(1-x) + f(1+x) = 0 implies that for any x, the sum of the function values at points equidistant from x=1 is zero. This means that the function exhibits point symmetry about (1,0). Specifically, f(1-x) = -f(1+x) shows that for any two points 1-x and 1+x, their function values are negatives of each other, indicating symmetry about the vertical line x=1 and hence about the point (1,0). - f(1-x) = -f(1+x) implies point symmetry about (1,0). 3. **Behavior on the Interval [1,2]:** Given the symmetry about (1,0) and the monotonic behavior on [0,1], we can infer the behavior on [1,2]. Since f(x) is decreasing on [0,1], and the function is symmetric about (1,0), it will continue to decrease on [1,2]. - f(x) is monotonically decreasing on [1,2]. 4. **Periodicity and Extrema:** From f(1-x) + f(1+x) = 0, we also derive that f(x) = -f(2+x). This relationship suggests a periodic behavior with a period of 4, as f(x+4) = -f(x+2) = f(x). This periodicity implies that the function repeats its values every 4 units along the x-axis. - The period of f(x) is 4. Given this periodicity and the monotonic behavior on [0,2], f(x) attains a minimum value at x=2 within one period and will attain maximum values at x=0, 4, 8, ldots, 4k for k in mathbb{Z}. - f(x) attains a minimum value at x=2 and maximum values at x=0, 4, 8, ldots, 4k for k in mathbb{Z}. Therefore, based on the analysis: - Statement A is incorrect because f(x) is decreasing on [1,2]. - Statement B is correct because the function exhibits symmetry about the point (1,0). - Statement C is correct because f(x) attains a minimum value at x=2. - Statement D is incorrect because f(x) does have maximum values at specific points.

Since (NM parallel AB), the alternate interior angle ( angle NMB = gamma ). 4.

We will consider different cases based on which digit is removed and show that having more than 7 digits leads to a contradiction. 1. **First Case: Removing the Last Digit** Suppose ( n ) is a Fantastic number with more than 7 digits, and we remove the last digit. Write ( n = 10a + b ), where ( b ) is the last digit and ( 0 leq b leq 9 ). Since ( a mid n ), we have ( a mid b ). Given that ( b neq 0 ), it follows that ( a leq 9 ). Therefore, ( n < 100 ), which contradicts our assumption that ( n ) has more than 7 digits. 2. **Second Case: Removing a Digit that is Neither the Last, First, nor Second** Suppose we remove a digit that is neither the last, first, nor second. Write ( n = 10^{k+1}a + 10^k b + c ), where ( a > 10 ), ( 0 < c < 10^k ), and ( 1 leq b leq 9 ) is the digit we remove. Since ( 10^k a + c mid n ), it also divides ( 10^{k+1}a + 10c ). Hence, ( 10^k a + c mid 10^k b - 9c ). The right-hand side (RHS) is not a multiple of 10 and is non-zero. Its absolute value is less than ( 10^{k+1} ), while ( 10^k a + c > 10^{k+1} ). This leads to a contradiction. 3. **Third Case: Removing the First Digit** Suppose we remove the first digit. Write ( n = 10^k b + c ), where ( 0 < c < 10^k ), ( 1 leq b leq 9 ), and ( k geq 7 ). Since ( c mid 10^k b + c ), we have ( c mid 10^k b ). If ( c ) is even, it is coprime to 5, so ( c mid 2^k b ). If ( c ) is odd, then ( c mid 5^k b ). In any case, ( c leq 5^k b ). On the other hand, the first digit of ( c ) does not vanish, so ( c geq 10^{k-1} ). Hence, ( 2^k leq 10b leq 90 ), which contradicts ( k geq 7 ). 4. **Fourth Case: Removing the Second Digit** Suppose we remove the second digit. Write ( n = 10^{k+1} a + 10^k b + c ), where ( 1 leq a leq 9 ). As before, we find that ( 10^k a + c mid 10^k b - 9c ) and hence ( 10^k a + c mid 10^k (9a + b) ). Therefore, ( 10^k a + c leq 5^k (9a + b) leq 90 cdot 5^k ). This implies ( 2^k leq 90 ), contradicting ( k geq 7 ).

The possible values for elements in B are -1, 3, and 2m-1. Since m^2 cannot be -1 for any real number m, and m^2 = 3 implies m = pmsqrt{3}, which are real numbers, but only m = sqrt{3} satisfies m^2 = 2m-1 when checked against the elements of B. Therefore, the value of m that makes A a subset of B is m = sqrt{3}. However, upon reevaluation, it's clear that the condition m^2 = 2m-1 was incorrectly considered. The correct approach is to directly find a value of m that makes m^2 an element of B without additional incorrect conditions. Given the elements of B, the only viable option for m^2 to match is 3, which is already an element of B. This implies m^2 = 3, leading to m = pmsqrt{3}.

Given this, the correct answer, based on the subset condition and the elements of B, is that m must be such that m^2 directly matches an element in B without the incorrect additional condition.

Pipe C can empty the tank in 12 hours, so its rate is -1/12 of the tank per hour (negative because it empties the tank). When all pipes are open, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: Combined rate = Rate of A + Rate of B + Rate of C Combined rate = (1/6) + (1/4) - (1/12) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case: Combined rate = (2/12) + (3/12) - (1/12) Combined rate = (2 + 3 - 1) / 12 Combined rate = 4/12 Combined rate = 1/3 (simplified) So, when all pipes are open, the tank is filled at a rate of 1/3 of the tank per hour.

Let a_{n} be the remaining capital of the company after submitting the capital at the end of the nth year. (1) Find a_{n}; (2) If the remaining capital of the company at the end of the mth year exceeds 300 million yuan, find the minimum value of m.","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: Find a_{n} 1. The capital growth formula for the company is given by a_{n+1} = (1 + 0.5)a_{n} - 1000. This is because the capital grows by 50% and then 10 million yuan is subtracted. Note that the capital in the formula is in thousands of yuan, hence 1000 represents 10 million yuan. 2. Simplifying the formula gives a_{n+1} = 1.5a_{n} - 1000. 3. We can then transform this formula to focus on the difference from a base capital of 2000 (or 20 million yuan in actual value), leading to a_{n+1} - 2000 = 1.5(a_{n} - 2000). This transformation helps in identifying the pattern of growth as a geometric sequence. 4. Given that a_{1} = 1.5 times 5000 - 1000 = 6500, we find that a_{1} - 2000 = 4500. This value, 4500, serves as the initial term of our geometric sequence. 5. Therefore, the general formula for the capital after the nth year, accounting for the geometric growth and the base capital, is a_{n} = 4500 times left(frac{3}{2}right)^{n-1} + 2000. Part 2: Find the minimum value of m for which a_{m} > 30000 1. Starting from the formula a_{m} = 4500 times left(frac{3}{2}right)^{m-1} + 2000, we set the inequality to find when the capital exceeds 300 million yuan (or 30000 in thousands of yuan). 2. The inequality becomes 4500 times left(frac{3}{2}right)^{m-1} + 2000 > 30000. 3. Simplifying the inequality, we find left(frac{3}{2}right)^{m-1} > frac{56}{9}, which further simplifies to left(frac{3}{2}right)^{m} > frac{28}{3}. 4.

The possible rotations are of the form ( frac{2kpi}{n} ) for ( k = 0, 1, ldots, n-1 ). - Because ( n ) is prime, the only subgroup of possible vertex positions formed by the rotations is the entire set of vertices itself. 3. **Analysis of Vertices and Edges:** - If for some angle ( alpha neq 2pi ), the polygon maps onto itself, it must mean that the vertices and edges are invariant under this rotation. - This implies that each vertex can be mapped to every other vertex through some rotation. Hence, every two vertices of the polygon can be made coincident by rotating the circle around the center. 4. **Implication for Polygon Properties:** - If every vertex can be mapped onto every other vertex through a suitable rotation, then all vertices, sides, and angles must be congruent. Hence, the polygon must be regular. - This contradicts the given condition that the polygon is irregular. 5. **Conclusion:** - Our initial assumption that ( n ) is prime leads us to conclude that the polygon must be regular based on the rotational symmetry. However, the polygon is given as irregular, leading to a contradiction. - Therefore, our assumption that ( n ) is prime is incorrect, hence ( n ) must be a composite number. Thus, we have proved that ( n ) is a composite number, concluding the proof.

The task is to construct a triangle given these altitudes. **Step 2: Relating the given altitudes to the sides of the triangle** The equation for twice the area of the triangle can be given in three forms involving the sides (a), (b), and (c) and their respective altitudes (m_a), (m_b), and (m_c): [ 2t = a m_a = b m_b = c m_c ] This implies the proportional relationships between the sides and the altitudes. Using these proportionalities: [ frac{a}{b} = frac{m_b}{m_a} quad text{and} quad frac{b}{c} = frac{m_c}{m_b} ] **Step 3: Deriving proportional side lengths** Given the relationships, we aim to determine segments that are proportional to the sides of the actual triangle. We choose representative segments (a'), (b'), and (c'). To simplify, choose (a' = m_b) and (b' = m_a). Then we use the proportionality relationships: [ frac{a'}{b'} = frac{m_b}{m_a} ] which is trivially true from our choice. To find (c'), we use the relationship: [ frac{b'}{c'} = frac{m_c}{m_b} ] [ c' = frac{m_a cdot m_b}{m_c} ] **Step 4: Constructing the scaled triangle** The segments (a' = m_b), (b' = m_a), and (c' = frac{m_a cdot m_b}{m_c}) define a triangle that is similar to the desired triangle. The actual triangle can be obtained from this triangle through a similarity transformation that scales it to the required size. **Step 5: Alternative proportional relationships** An alternative formulation of the proportional relationships is: [ frac{a}{b}{c} = frac{1}{m_a}: frac{1}{m_b}: frac{1}{m_c} ] This states that the sides of the triangle are directly proportional to the reciprocals of the altitudes. The reciprocal values are denoted by (a', b', c') as constructed previously, enforcing: [ m_a a' = m_b b' = m_c c' = 1 ] **Step 6: Geometric interpretation and constraint** The heights of these reciprocal triangles should correctly construct similar triangles. The necessary condition for constructing such a triangle from given heights is that the sum of the reciprocals of any two altitudes must be greater than the reciprocal of the third altitude: [ frac{1}{m_a} + frac{1}{m_b} > frac{1}{m_c}, quad frac{1}{m_b} + frac{1}{m_c} > frac{1}{m_a}, quad text{and} quad frac{1}{m_c} + frac{1}{m_a} > frac{1}{m_b} ] **Conclusion** The triangle can be constructed by using the given altitudes to find the proportional side lengths and then performing a similarity transformation. Whether the triangle can be constructed ultimately hinges on meeting the aforementioned inequality conditions. [ boxed{m_a, m_b, m_c} ]"},{"prompt":"Given three points (A), (B), and (C) on a circle.

Find the number of arrangements of these seven cards where two of the cards can be removed, leaving the remaining five cards in either ascending or descending order.","completion":"1. **Consider Ascending Order**: Any sequence where removing two cards results in an ascending sequence. Since the final sequence after removals must be in strict ascending order, the original sequence should nearly be ascending, with perhaps two cards that can be removed to achieve this. 2. **Choose and Remove Two Cards**: - Select any two cards out of seven to remove. This can be done in binom{7}{2} = 21 ways. - For each selection, ensure the remaining cards are in ascending order. Since the sequence 1 through 7 can be rearranged in 5! = 120 ways after removing two cards, the two removed cards must be such that the order of the remaining is still ascending. Thus, each valid selection where the remaining five are in order is counted once. 3. **Account for Descending Order**: Similar to the ascending order argument, there are also 21 choices of pairs that can be removed to leave cards in descending order. 4. **Calculate Total Valid Arrangements**: - Since ascending and descending are mutually exclusive and directly symmetrical in counting due to the reversal property, the total number of arrangements is 21 (ascending) + 21 (descending) = 42. 5. **Conclusion**: The final answer is boxed{42}."},{"prompt":"Given a complex number z satisfies left(2+iright)z=24i, then the imaginary part of z is ( ) A: 2i B: 2i C: 2 D: 2","completion":"To solve for z in the given equation left(2+iright)z=2-4i, we first isolate z: z = frac{2-4i}{2+i} To simplify the fraction, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator: z = frac{(2-4i)(2-i)}{(2+i)(2-i)} Expanding both the numerator and the denominator: z = frac{4 - 2i - 8i + 4i^2}{4 - 2i + 2i - i^2} Since i^2 = -1, we can simplify further: z = frac{4 - 10i - 4}{4 + 1} z = frac{-10i}{5} z = -2i Therefore, the imaginary part of z is -2.

However, in this case, we are looking for the minimum number, so we can use a simpler approach by considering the maximum overlap. Since 95% of the people have air-conditioners, which is the highest percentage among all the luxuries, we can start by assuming that all the people who have refrigerators, televisions, and computers also have air-conditioners. This is because we want to find the minimum number of people who have all four items, so we assume the maximum overlap with the item that the most people have.

Since the dealer uses a counterfeit weight that is 20% less than the real weight, when he sells 1 kg, he actually gives only 0.8 kg of the product. Now, he adds 35% impurities to the product. This means that in the 0.8 kg he gives to the customer, only 65% is the actual product, and 35% is impurities. So, the actual amount of the product the customer gets is: 0.65 * 0.8 kg = 0.52 kg The dealer charges for 1 kg, but the customer only receives 0.52 kg of the actual product. The cost of 0.52 kg of the product to the dealer is: 100 * 0.52 = 52 The dealer sells this for 100 (the price of 1 kg), so his profit is: 100 - 52 = 48 To find the profit percentage, we use the formula: Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100 Plugging in the values we have: Profit Percentage = (48 / 52) * 100 ≈ 92.31% So, the net profit percentage of the dealer is approximately boxed{92.31%} ."},{"prompt":"Rose had 20 kilograms of rice.

Next, she cooked 1/3 of the remaining rice in the afternoon: 1/3 of 19.4 kilograms = 19.4 kilograms / 3 = 6.46666667 kilograms (approximately) After cooking in the afternoon, Rose had: 19.4 kilograms - 6.46666667 kilograms ≈ 12.93333333 kilograms of rice left. Then, she cooked 3/7 of what was left in the evening: 3/7 of 12.93333333 kilograms ≈ 12.93333333 kilograms * (3/7) ≈ 5.54285714 kilograms After cooking in the evening, Rose had: 12.93333333 kilograms - 5.54285714 kilograms ≈ 7.39047619 kilograms of rice left. Now, Rose gave 2 pounds of cooked rice to her neighbor. We need to convert pounds to kilograms to subtract from the remaining rice. There are approximately 0.45359237 kilograms in a pound. So, 2 pounds is: 2 pounds * 0.45359237 kilograms/pound ≈ 0.90718474 kilograms After giving rice to her neighbor, Rose had: 7.39047619 kilograms - 0.90718474 kilograms ≈ 6.48329145 kilograms of rice left.

In this case, a_1 = 5, r = 2, and n = 9. Solving for the 9th position, we get: a_9 = 5 times 2^{(9-1)} = 5 times 256 = boxed{1280}"},{"prompt":"Let q(x) = x^2 + ax + b, where a and b are integers.

The total amount she received from the sale after paying the broker's commission is the selling price minus the commission: [ text{Total amount received} = 1.20P - 0.05P ] We know that the house sold for 100,000, so: [ 1.20P - 0.05P = 100,000 ] [ 1.15P = 100,000 ] Now, we can solve for ( P ) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.15: [ P = frac{100,000}{1.15} ] [ P = 86,956.52 ] Therefore, the original price of the house was approximately boxed{86,956.52} ."},{"prompt":"Xiao Ming's home is 2000 meters away from the school.

On the day he woke up late, he increased his speed by 5 meters per minute, making his speed frac{2000}{x} + 5 meters per minute. However, it's more accurate to say that he arrived 2 minutes earlier than usual, so his actual travel time that day was x-2 minutes.

Here r represents the term position (from 0 to 8). We know that the term is rational when the exponent of x is an integer, which happens when r = 0, 4, or 8. These are the three rational terms, and the remaining six terms are irrational. Let's examine the number of arrangements: - The total number of permutations of the 9 terms is 9!. - The rational terms will be non-adjacent if we first arrange the 6 irrational terms and then insert the 3 rational terms into any of the 7 gaps (before the first term, between the irrational terms, and after the last term). The number of ways to do this is 6! times P(7, 3), where P(7, 3) represents the number of permutations of 3 items from 7. Therefore, the probability that all rational terms are non-adjacent is given by: P = frac{6! times P(7, 3)}{9!}. We know that P(n, k) = frac{n!}{(n-k)!}, thus we simplify to find P: P = frac{6! times frac{7!}{(7-3)!}}{9!}. Now, let's cancel out the common factorial terms: P = frac{6! times 7!}{4! times 9!}. Further simplification yields: P = frac{6! times 7 times 6 times 5}{4 times 3 times 2 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6 times 5 times 4 times 3 times 2}. Canceling the common terms on both the numerator and denominator, we get: P = frac{1}{9 times 8} = frac{1}{72}. However, since this probability doesn't match any of the provided options, we must have made a mistake. Let's reevaluate the calculation: The number of permutations of the 3 rational items among the 7 spots is not P(7, 3) but instead C(7, 3), because the order of the rational terms doesn't matter when placed in the spots. The correction leads to: P = frac{6! times C(7, 3)}{9!}. Expanding the combination, C(7, 3) = frac{7!}{3! times 4!}, we have: P = frac{6! times frac{7!}{3! times 4!}}{9!} = frac{6! times 7 times 6 times 5}{3! times 9 times 8!} = frac{7 times 5}{3 times 9 times 8} = frac{35}{216}. After correcting the calculation, we now get: P = frac{35}{216}. This result is still not in line with the given options, indicating the necessity of revisiting the problem's original statement and solution for verification. Upon revision, it becomes clear that: - The total permutations of the 9 terms are 9!. - The number of ways to arrange the 6 irrational terms in any order is 6!. - The number of ways to select 3 spots from the available 7 spots (before, between, and after the 6 irrational terms) for the rational terms is C(7, 3). This gives us: P = frac{6! times C(7, 3)}{9!}. Using the expression for combinations, C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, we find: P = frac{6! times frac{7!}{3! times 4!}}{9!} = frac{7 times 6 times 5}{9 times 8 times 7 times 6} = frac{5}{3 times 8} = frac{5}{24}.

We need to demonstrate that it holds for (n = n_0 + 1). 8. If (m, k leq n_0), by the induction hypothesis and lemma, (gcd(a_m, a_k) = a_d). 9. If (m = k = n_0 + 1), by definition and lemma, the conclusion trivially holds. 10. We only need to consider the case where one of (m) or (k) equals (n_0 + 1) while the other is at most (n_0). Without loss of generality, let (m = n_0 + 1) and (k leq n_0). 11. Consequently, ( n_0 = m - 1 geq m - k = n_0 - k + 1 geq 1 ), hence ( m - k ) is a natural number not exceeding (n_0). 12. Using the observation (gcd(m, k) = gcd(m-k, k)) and the induction hypothesis, [ a_d = a_{gcd(m, k)} = a_{gcd(m-k, k)} = gcd(a_{m-k}, a_k). ] 13. Therefore, we need to validate: [ gcd(a_m, a_k) = gcd(a_{m-k}, a_k). ] Given (a_m = P_{m-k}(a_k)), and following the analysis as in the lemma, it follows that: [ gcd(a_m, a_k) = gcd(a_{m-k}, a_k). ] 14. As this completes the proof for (m = n_0 + 1), (k leq n_0), and all cases ( m leq n ), ( k leq n ), we can conclude: [ gcd(a_m, a_k) = a_d. ]. In conclusion, for any natural numbers m and k with gcd d, we have gcd(a_m, a_k) = a_d. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"John buys 3 different coolers. The first one is 100 liters.

Let a_1 = k cdot r^{15}. - From r^{15} leq a_1 < 10^9: [ lg r < frac{9}{15} = 0.6 implies r < 4, ] implying r = 2 or r = 3. 4. **Finding Possible Values for r and p:** - For r = 2, possible p values must be odd: [ frac{3}{2} < 1.58 quad text{and} quad frac{5}{2} > 1.67 quad text{(no valid value)}. ] - For r = 3, valid p: [ frac{4}{3} < 1.58 < frac{5}{3} < 1.67 quad implies p = 5. ] - Thus, q = frac{5}{3}. 5. **Determine k:** - Combining the constraints: [ a_1 geq 10^8 implies k geq frac{10^8}{3^{15}}, ] and [ a_{10} = a_1 q^9 < 10^{10} implies k < frac{10^{10}}{3^{15} cdot q^9}. ] - Calculations: [ left(text{Using } 3^{15} = 243^3 implies 243 approx 2.3856 right)quad lg 3^{15} > 7.1567 implies lg k geq 8 - 7.1567 = 0.8433 implies k > 6. ] - Combining upper bound: [ k < frac{10^{10}}{3^{15} cdot (5/3)^9} = frac{2^{10} cdot 5^{10}}{3^6 cdot 5^9} = frac{2^9 cdot 10}{3^6} = frac{5120}{729} < 8. ] - Hence: [ k = 7. ] 6. **Determine the Full Sequence:** - Initial term: [ a_1 = 7 cdot 3^{15} = 100442349. ] - General term: [ a_i = 7 cdot 3^{16-i} cdot 5^{i-1}. ] - Last term verification: [ a_{16} = 213623046875 quad text{(not divisible by 3)}. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{a_i = 7 cdot 3^{16-i} cdot 5^{i-1}} ]"},{"prompt":"A 50 ml aftershave lotion with a certain percentage of alcohol is mixed with 30 ml of pure water.

The amount of alcohol in the 50 ml after-shave lotion is then (P/100) * 50 ml. When the 50 ml after-shave lotion is mixed with 30 ml of pure water, the total volume of the new solution becomes 50 ml + 30 ml = 80 ml. According to the problem, the percentage of alcohol in the new 80 ml solution is 18.75%. This means that the amount of alcohol in the new solution is (18.75/100) * 80 ml. Since the amount of alcohol doesn't change when water is added, we can set up the equation: (P/100) * 50 = (18.75/100) * 80 Now, we can solve for P: P * 50 = 18.75 * 80 P = (18.75 * 80) / 50 P = 1500 / 50 P = 30 So, the initial percentage of alcohol in the after-shave lotion is boxed{30%} ."},{"prompt":"Mrs. Lee has 12 grandchildren.

Then, there exist odd integers (a) and (b) such that (1 leq a < b leq 2n-1) and (a^a equiv b^b pmod{2^n}). 2. **Define (k)**: Let (k = v_2(b - a)), where (v_2(x)) denotes the 2-adic valuation of (x), i.e., the highest power of 2 dividing (x). Since (a) and (b) are odd, (b - a) is even, and thus (k geq 1). 3. **Bound (k)**: Since (b - a leq (2n-1) - 1 = 2n - 2), we have (2^k leq 2n - 2). Therefore, (k leq n - 1). 4. **Modulo (2^{k+1})**: Since (k leq n - 1), we have (k + 1 leq n). Thus, we can consider the congruence modulo (2^{k+1}). We have: [ a^a equiv b^b pmod{2^{k+1}} ] 5. **Euler's Totient Function**: Note that (varphi(2^{k+1}) = 2^k), where (varphi) is Euler's totient function. Since (a) and (b) are odd and coprime to (2^{k+1}), we can use properties of exponents modulo (2^{k+1}): [ b^b equiv b^a pmod{2^{k+1}} ] because (2^k mid b - a). 6. **Combine Congruences**: Thus, we have: [ a^a equiv b^b equiv b^a pmod{2^{k+1}} ] This implies: [ a^a equiv b^a pmod{2^{k+1}} ] 7. **Factor the Difference**: Consider the difference: [ b^a - a^a = (b - a)(b^{a-1} + b^{a-2}a + cdots + a^{a-1}) ] Since (a) and (b) are odd, each term in the sum (b^{a-1} + b^{a-2}a + cdots + a^{a-1}) is odd, and there are (a) terms, which is also odd. Therefore, the sum is odd. 8. **Contradiction**: Since (2^{k+1} mid b^a - a^a) and the sum is odd, it must be that (2^{k+1} mid b - a). However, by definition, (v_2(b - a) = k), which means (2^k mid b - a) but (2^{k+1} nmid b - a). This is a contradiction. 9. **Conclusion**: Therefore, no such (a) and (b) exist, and the numbers (1^1, 3^3, 5^5, ldots, (2n-1)^{2n-1}) all give different remainders when divided by (2^n).

This follows from the PNT, as: [ pi(2N) - pi(N) sim frac{N}{log N} ] which grows without bound as ( N ) increases. 3. **Construction of ( n ):** Let ( N ) be such that the number of primes between ( N ) and ( 2N ) is at least ( l + 2 ).

The approach often involves leveraging intrinsic properties of these solids and geometric constraints inherent to the convex polyhedra. Let's elaborate the solution step-by-step. Problem 109: 1. **(a) Prove that no convex polyhedron can be composed of two or more non-overlapping different cubes:** This problem hinges on understanding the constraints imposed by the definition and properties of convex polyhedra. The argument is developed analogously to problem 101. We'll utilize geometric properties of cubes in Euclidean space. 1. **Properties of Composing Cubes:** - If a convex polyhedron P is constructed from a finite number of cubes, then the edges of all cubes must be parallel to each other because each cube has orthogonal edge pairs. - Since a cube has three sets of parallel faces, any convex polyhedron P formed from such cubes must also adhere to this characteristic. 2. **Parallel Faces Argument:** - Since P is a convex polyhedron, all faces must be comprised of plane segments that do not intersect except at the edges. - A convex polyhedron cannot have three pairs of parallel faces (by definition, recalling that each face’s plane should lie entirely on one side), implying P would need to be a hexahedron itself. 3. **Conclusion Regarding Composing Cubes:** - Hence, the only possible form P can take is a cuboid, specifically a rectangular parallelepiped. Beyond this, constructing any different convex polyhedral shape from multiple cubes while maintaining convexity is geometrically impossible. - Thus, we conclude that a convex polyhedron composed of cubes must itself be a single cube or a parallelepiped, without the possibility of any new convex shape emerging from the composition of multiple non-overlapping cubes. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{It is impossible to compose a convex polyhedron from two or more non-overlapping different cubes.}} ] 2. **(b) Prove that no convex polyhedron composed of two or more non-overlapping correct tetrahedra can exist:** When dealing with tetrahedra (four-faced polyhedra with triangular faces), the argument slightly varies but the essential logic remains in geometric constraints. 1. **Properties of Tetrahedra:** - Each correct tetrahedron has symmetrical triangular faces that align perfectly among other tetrahedra they reconstruct. - Consider a hypothetical convex polyhedron composed of different tetrahedra P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n. 2. **Face Consideration and Adjacency:** - For such a polyhedron P, it can only be composed if the faces perfectly align in a manner to maintain convexity. Importantly, adjacent faces sharing an edge should be part of two distinct tetrahedra validly. 3. **Geometric Impossibility:** - If we attempt to tessellate tetrahedra to make whole convex polyhedra, the cumulative structure should uphold the property of face adjacency without redundancy, which is geometrically complex due to tetrahedra's angular nature: - Each triangular face must be exclusive among the composing tetrahedra faces if P is to retain simplicity and convexity. 4. **Convex Polyhedral Construction Limitation:** - The result shows that no unique convex polyhedron can maintain this geometric purity and segmented construction from multiple non-overlapping tetrahedra. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{It is impossible to compose a convex polyhedron from two or more non-overlapping correct tetrahedra.}} ] We can extend the reasoning to further shape polytopes (polyhedral forms) such as octahedra, icosahedra, and dodecahedra, each leveraging their symmetrical properties and inherent face structures to illustrate similar proofs about convex combination infeasibility provided they claim analogous construction constraints. In conclusion: 1. No convex polyhedron can be composed from two or more non-overlapping different correct tetrahedra. 2. Extending the argument upon symmetry and geometric pacts asserts the infeasibility for octahedra, icosahedron, and dodecahedra alike in future analogous problem confrontations beyond simple alteration.

We do so by jumping a distance that is greater than any previous jump and landing on a point that has not been visited yet. - Then, we make another jump to the desired column (again a jump with an appropriately large and unused length). - Finally, we move to the desired grid point.

At the plane ( z = 1 ), we take a regular ( N )-gon with vertices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_N ). 3. **Construct points on the cone:** Let ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_N ) be the midpoints of minor arcs ( A_1A_2, A_2A_3, ldots, A_NA_1 ), respectively.

According to the problem, there exists a team j_{1} such that (1, 2) rightarrow j_{1}, meaning team j_{1} has beaten both team 1 and team 2. - Similarly, there must be a team j_{2} such that (1, j_{1}) rightarrow j_{2}, which means team j_{2} has beaten both team 1 and team j_{1}. - Continuing this line of reasoning, there exists a team j_{3} such that (1, j_{2}) rightarrow j_{3}. Therefore, team j_{3} has beaten both team 1 and team j_{2}. - Teams j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3} are distinct because each one is beaten by a different team in the sequence. 3. **Teams Losing Constraints:** - This reasoning implies that team 1 has lost to at least 3 different teams: j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}. The same reasoning can be applied to every team, indicating that each team has lost to at least 3 other teams. - Each game is a loss for one team and a win for another, so the total number of losses (or equivalently, the total number of games) is at least 3n. 4. **Combinatorial Argument:** - The total number of ways to choose 2 teams out of n teams is given by the combination formula: [ binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ] - Since each pair of teams has a common third team that has beaten both, the number of such pairs must be at least 3n.

We will consider two possible perpendiculars dropped from X: - XP perpendicular to OA - XQ perpendicular to OB 2. **Case 1: When X is on the bisector**: If X lies on the bisector of the angle angle AOB, then angle AOX = angle BOX. - We form two right-angled triangles, triangle OXP and triangle OXQ. - In these triangles: - OX is the common hypotenuse for both triangles. - angle OXP = angle OXQ since X lies on the bisector.

By the *Triangle Inequality Theorem*: - XP is larger than XR (since XP = XY + YP which includes YP as an additional length as compared to XR < XY + YP). Since Y lies on the bisector and YP = YR, the perpendicular XR must be shorter than XP because XY is additional length added to YP. 4. **Generalization for different sides of the bisector**: If X is on the opposite side of the bisector from OB, we can similarly argue by symmetry that the perpendicular dropped on OA will be shorter. - Let X' be a point on the bisector mirrored on the opposite side, dropping perpendiculars X'P' to OA and X'Q' to OB. - Thus, the perpendicular from X to OA must be shorter than XQ in relation to its position relative to the bisector. # Conclusion Thus, we have: - If X lies on the bisector, then the perpendiculars to each side of the angle are equal. - If X lies on the same side of the bisector as one of the sides of the angle, then the perpendicular dropped to that side is shorter. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given (a, b, c in mathbb{R}^{+}), prove that: frac{a^{2}+bc}{a(b+c)}+frac{b^{2}+ca}{b(c+a)}+frac{c^{2}+ab}{c(a+b)} geq 3 .","completion":"We are given the inequality to prove: frac{a^{2} + bc}{a(b+c)} + frac{b^{2} + ca}{b(c+a)} + frac{c^{2} + ab}{c(a+b)} geq 3, where (a, b, c in mathbb{R}^+). 1. **Rewriting Each Term by Adding 1:** Let's rewrite each fraction by adding and subtracting 1: [ frac{a^{2} + bc}{a(b+c)} + 1 = frac{a^{2} + bc + a(b+c)}{a(b+c)} = frac{a^2 + bc + ab + ac}{a(b+c)} = frac{(a+b)(a+c)}{a(b+c)}. ] Similarly, for the other terms: [ frac{b^{2} + ca}{b(c+a)} + 1 = frac{b^2 + ca + b(c+a)}{b(c+a)} = frac{(b+c)(b+a)}{b(c+a)}, ] [ frac{c^{2} + ab}{c(a+b)} + 1 = frac{c^2 + ab + c(a+b)}{c(a+b)} = frac{(c+a)(c+b)}{c(a+b)}. ] 2. **Combining the Identity:** Adding the three identities from above: [ left( frac{a^{2} + bc}{a(b+c)} + 1 right) + left( frac{b^{2} + ca}{b(c+a)} + 1 right) + left( frac{c^{2} + ab}{c(a+b)} + 1 right) - 3 = frac{(a+b)(a+c)}{a(b+c)} + frac{(b+c)(b+a)}{b(c+a)} + frac{(c+a)(c+b)}{c(a+b)} - 3. ] 3. **Applying the AM-GM Inequality:** By the Am-GM inequality, we have: [ frac{(a+b)(a+c)}{a(b+c)} + frac{(b+c)(b+a)}{b(c+a)} + frac{(c+a)(c+b)}{c(a+b)} geq 3 sqrt[3]{ frac{(a+b)(a+c)}{a(b+c)} cdot frac{(b+c)(b+a)}{b(c+a)} cdot frac{(c+a)(c+b)}{c(a+b)}}. ] 4. **Simplifying the Expression Inside the Cubic Root:** Simplify the product under the cubic root: [ frac{(a+b)(a+c)}{a(b+c)} cdot frac{(b+c)(b+a)}{b(c+a)} cdot frac{(c+a)(c+b)}{c(a+b)} = frac{(a+b)(a+c)(b+c)(b+a)(c+a)(c+b)}{abc(b+c)(c+a)(a+b)}. ] The terms inside the product cancel out and simplify to: [ = frac{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}{abc}. ] 5. **Further Simplification with Geometric Mean:** Now, by the AM-GM inequality applied to each term inside the cubic: [ 3 sqrt[3]{frac{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}{abc}} geq 3 sqrt[3]{frac{2sqrt{ab} cdot 2sqrt{bc} cdot 2sqrt{ca}}{abc}}. ] This simplifies to: [ 3 sqrt[3]{frac{8 sqrt{(abc)^2}}{abc}} = 3 sqrt[3]{8} = 3 cdot 2 = 6. ] 6. **Subtracting 3:** Subtract 3 from both sides to obtain the desired: [ 3 cdot 2 - 3 = 3. ] Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{a^{2} + b c}{a(b+c)} + frac{b^{2} + c a}{b(c+a)} + frac{c^{2} + a b}{c(a+b)} geq 3} ]"},{"prompt":"f 6.2 represents 3.6% of a certain number, what is that number up to 2 decimal places?","completion":"To find the certain number, we can set up a proportion where 6.2 is 3.6% of that number.

Given that the inequality must hold for some x in the interval [1,3], we analyze the expression x^{2}-ax+4 < 0 by considering the quadratic formula and the vertex form of a parabola. The key insight is to find a condition on a that ensures the inequality holds. 1. **Understanding the Minimum Value of x+frac{4}{x}:** The expression a > left(x+frac{4}{x}right)_{min} comes from the requirement that for the inequality x^{2}-ax+4 < 0 to hold, a must be greater than the minimum value of the expression x+frac{4}{x} over the interval [1,3]. 2. **Finding the Minimum Value:** To find the minimum value of x+frac{4}{x}, we use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), which states that for any non-negative real numbers a and b, the following holds: frac{a+b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}, with equality if and only if a=b.

Given angle BOD = 120^circ, triangle OBD is isosceles with OB = OD. 4. **Calculate the radius R:** Using the fact that BD = 3 (since MB + MD = 1 + 2 = 3), we can find R: [ BD = 2R sin(60^circ) = 2R cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = Rsqrt{3} ] Given BD = 3, we have: [ Rsqrt{3} = 3 implies R = sqrt{3} ] 5. **Determine MA and MC:** Using the power of a point theorem at M: [ MA times MC = MB times MD = 1 times 2 = 2 ] Also, since AC = 2R = 2sqrt{3}, we have: [ MA + MC = 2sqrt{3} ] Solving these equations, we get: [ MA = sqrt{3} + 1 quad text{and} quad MC = sqrt{3} - 1 ] 6. **Calculate OM:** Since O is the circumcenter, OM = OC - MC: [ OM = sqrt{3} - (sqrt{3} - 1) = 1 ] 7. **Determine angle COD:** Since OM = 1, MD = 2, and OD = sqrt{3}, triangle OMD is a right triangle: [ angle COD = 90^circ ] 8. **Find angle CAD:** Since angle COD = 90^circ, angle CAD = frac{1}{2} angle COD = 45^circ. 9. **Analyze triangle DAC:** triangle DAC is an isosceles right triangle with angle ADC = 90^circ and DA = DC.

Each cell in the grid can be denoted as ( (r, c) ). 2. **Properties of the Grid**: - The numbers in each row increase from left to right. - The numbers in each column increase from top to bottom. 3. **Diagonal Analysis**: Consider the diagonals of the grid.

An interior angle (e.g., angle ( phi)) can be expressed as the difference between two angles that each side of the triangle makes with the x-axis (possibly after considering appropriate orientations and direction adjustments): [ phi = theta_1 - theta_2 ] where (theta_1) and (theta_2) are the angles between two different sides of the triangle and the x-axis.

Consequently, (tan(theta_1 - theta_2)), which is (tan phi), must also be rational. 6. **Conclusion:** Thus, by showing that the tangent of any angle in the triangle (formed by vertices lying on integer coordinates) involves rational numbers, we conclude that: [ text{The tangent of any angle in such a triangle is a rational number.} ] blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A square piece of paper has sides of length 100 .

Next, we analyze the range of f(x) based on the definition of our piecewise function with the new value for b. For x > 1, f(x) = ln x + 2. As ln x is an increasing function for x > 1, and its range is (-infty, +infty), adding 2 to this will still cover all real numbers but shifted up by 2. Thus, the range for x > 1 is (2, +infty).

The speed of the train can be calculated by dividing the distance it travels by the time it takes to travel that distance. The train crosses a 600 meter long signal post in 40 seconds.

We need to convert 20 minutes into seconds because the speed of the train is in meters per second. 20 minutes = 20 * 60 seconds 20 minutes = 1200 seconds The train takes 1200 seconds to cross the bridge at the speed of 15 meters/second. To find the length of the bridge (L), we can use the formula: L = Speed * Time L = 15 meters/second * 1200 seconds L = 18000 meters So, the length of the bridge is 18000 meters. However, when the train crosses the bridge, it has to cover its own length as well as the length of the bridge. Therefore, the total distance (D) the train covers when crossing the bridge is: D = Length of the train + Length of the bridge D = 600 meters + 18000 meters D = 18600 meters Now, to find out how long it will take to cross the bridge of a certain length at the same speed, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed We already know the total distance (D) is 18600 meters and the speed (S) is 15 meters/second, so: Time = 18600 meters / 15 meters/second Time = 1240 seconds Therefore, it will take the train boxed{1240} seconds to cross the bridge at the same speed."},{"prompt":"Find the area of the triangle intercepted by the line ( y = 3x + 1 ) from the region defined by the inequality ( |x 1| + |y 2| leq 2 ).","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of the triangular region cut off by the line (y = 3x + 1) from the figure defined by the inequality (|x-1| + |y-2| leq 2). 1. **Identify the figure:** The inequality (|x - 1| + |y - 2| leq 2) represents a diamond (rhombus) centered at ( (1, 2) ) with diagonals that are vertical and horizontal.

For example, considering vertices ((1, 4)) and ((3, 2)): [ d = sqrt{(3-1)^2 + (2-4)^2} = sqrt{4 + 4} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2} ] Thus, each side of the diamond is (2sqrt{2}). 4. **Equation of the line and its geometry:** The line (y = 3x + 1) passes through the corner of the diamond.

The mean bar{x} of the set is given by: bar{x} = frac{-5 + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5}{11} = frac{0}{11} = 0 2. **Calculate the Initial Sum of Squares:** The sum of squares of the given set is: sum x_i^2 = (-5)^2 + (-4)^2 + (-3)^2 + (-2)^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 110 3. **Calculate the Initial Variance:** Variance S^2 is given by: S^2 = frac{sum x_i^2}{n} - bar{x}^2 For our initial set: S^2 = frac{110}{11} - 0^2 = 10 4. **Formulate Conditions for New Set:** When replacing one number a with two numbers b and c, the new set will have 12 elements. To ensure the mean remains zero, the sum of the new set must also be zero. Thus, we have: a = b + c The sum of squares of the new set must be the same as before for the variance to remain unchanged. Therefore: sum x_i^2 -> sum x_i^2 + b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = 110 + b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = 120 Simplifying, we get: b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = 10 5. **Solve the Equations:** From the condition a = b + c and b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = 10, we employ the identities: (b+c)^2 = b^2 + c^2 + 2bc Thus: b^2 + c^2 - (b+c)^2 = 10 Simplifying: b^2 + c^2 - (b^2 + c^2 + 2bc) = 10 -2bc = 10 quad Rightarrow quad bc = -5 6. **Find Suitable Values of b and c:** We see bc = -5.

The tangent to the circle at ((a, b)) has a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the radius at that point. The slope of the radius is (frac{b}{a}), so the slope of the tangent is: [ -frac{a}{b} ] 3. The equation of the tangent line at ((a, b)) can be written in point-slope form: [ y - b = -frac{a}{b}(x - a) ] Simplifying, we get: [ y = -frac{a}{b}x + frac{a^2}{b} + b ] Using (a^2 + b^2 = 1), we can rewrite the equation as: [ y = -frac{a}{b}x + frac{1}{b} ] 4. We need to find the intersection of this tangent line with the parabola (y = x^2 + 1). Setting the equations equal to each other: [ x^2 + 1 = -frac{a}{b}x + frac{1}{b} ] Multiplying through by (b) to clear the fraction: [ bx^2 + b = -ax + 1 ] Rearranging terms: [ bx^2 + ax + (b - 1) = 0 ] 5. For the tangent to intersect the parabola at exactly one point, the quadratic equation must have exactly one solution. This occurs when the discriminant is zero. The discriminant of (bx^2 + ax + (b - 1) = 0) is given by: [ Delta = a^2 - 4b(b - 1) ] Setting the discriminant to zero: [ a^2 - 4b(b - 1) = 0 ] Substituting (a^2 = 1 - b^2) from the circle equation: [ 1 - b^2 - 4b^2 + 4b = 0 ] Simplifying: [ 1 - 5b^2 + 4b = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in (b). Solving for (b): [ 5b^2 - 4b - 1 = 0 ] Using the quadratic formula (b = frac{-B pm sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}) where (A = 5), (B = -4), and (C = -1): [ b = frac{4 pm sqrt{16 + 20}}{10} = frac{4 pm sqrt{36}}{10} = frac{4 pm 6}{10} ] Thus, we have: [ b = 1 quad text{or} quad b = -frac{1}{5} ] 6. For (b = 1): [ a^2 + 1^2 = 1 implies a^2 = 0 implies a = 0 ] So, one point is ((0, 1)). 7. For (b = -frac{1}{5}): [ a^2 + left(-frac{1}{5}right)^2 = 1 implies a^2 + frac{1}{25} = 1 implies a^2 = frac{24}{25} implies a = pm frac{2sqrt{6}}{5} ] So, the other points are (left(frac{2sqrt{6}}{5}, -frac{1}{5}right)) and (left(-frac{2sqrt{6}}{5}, -frac{1}{5}right)). The final answer is ( boxed{ (0, 1) } ), (left(frac{2sqrt{6}}{5}, -frac{1}{5}right)), and (left(-frac{2sqrt{6}}{5}, -frac{1}{5}right))."},{"prompt":"The lengths of the sides of a triangle with positive area are log_{10}15, log_{10}81, and log_{10}m, where m is a positive integer.

Solving these inequalities: 1. log_{10}(81m) > log_{10}15 implies 81m > 15 or m > frac{15}{81} = frac{5}{27} approx 0.185. Since m is an integer, m geq 1. 2. log_{10}(15 cdot 81) > log_{10} m yields log_{10}(1215) > log_{10} m, so 1215 > m. 3. log_{10}(15m) > log_{10}81 implies 15m > 81 or m > frac{81}{15} = 5.4.

This means each side of the triangle is pivoting around the point where it touches the polygon M. 6. **Non-Degenerate Segment**: As we rotate, eventually one of the lines will meet the border of the polygon M along a non-degenerate segment. This is because the continuous rotation will align one of the sides of the triangle with a side of the polygon due to the convex nature of M. 7. **Similarity and Enlargement**: The triangle obtained after rotation is similar to the initial triangle triangle ABC but possibly smaller. To make it congruent to triangle ABC, we enlarge it by moving its sides away from the polygon, keeping them parallel to themselves, until it reaches the initial size. 8. **Conclusion**: The final triangle is congruent to triangle ABC and has one side parallel to or coinciding with one side of the polygon M.

This is because we can always translate the entire set of points such that one of them is at the origin. 2. **Area formula for a triangle:** If ( A(a,b) ) and ( B(x,y) ) are two points, the area of triangle ( OAB ) is given by: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| ax - by right| ] For the area to be an integer (possibly zero), ( left| ax - by right| ) must be an even integer. 3. **Coordinate parity analysis:** - If one of the points, say ( A ), has both coordinates even, then ( a ) and ( b ) are even. Thus, ( ax ) and ( by ) are even for any integer coordinates ( x ) and ( y ). Therefore, ( left| ax - by right| ) is even, ensuring the area is an integer. - If two points, say ( A ) and ( B ), have all their coordinates odd, then ( a, b, x, ) and ( y ) are all odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd, so ( ax ) and ( by ) are odd. The difference of two odd numbers is even, ensuring ( left| ax - by right| ) is even. - The same logic applies if two points have coordinates of the form ( (o,e) ) or ( (e,o) ), where ( e ) stands for even and ( o ) stands for odd. 4. **Conclusion from parity analysis:** If a set of integer points does not contain three points which are the vertices of a triangle with integer area, then this set must have at most 4 elements. This is because there are only 4 possible combinations of parity for the coordinates: ( (e,e), (e,o), (o,e), (o,o) ). 5. **Existence of a set with 4 elements:** Consider the four vertices of a unit square: ( (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) ). None of these points form a triangle with integer area, as the area of any triangle formed by these points is either ( frac{1}{2} ) or 0.

Prove that point M lies on the line AB, and point N lies on the line BC.","completion":"To demonstrate that the point (M) lies on the line (AB) and the point (N) lies on the line (BC), we proceed with the following steps: 1. **Definition of Reference Points and Circle**: - Let the diameter (DB) of the circle intersect the smaller arbelos circles at points (M) and (N). - Note that (D) and (B) are diametrically opposite points on the circle. 2. **Right Angles Formed by Diameters**: - The angle (angle AMD) is a right angle ((90^circ)). According to the circle theorem, an angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is always a right angle. Here, it is subtended by diameter (AD). - Similarly, (angle BMD) is also a right angle ((90^circ)), since it is subtended by the same diameter (DB). 3. **Collinearity of Points on Diameter Projection**: - Because (angle AMD = 90^circ) and (angle BMD = 90^circ), adding these angles gives: [ angle AMB = angle AMD + angle BMD = 90^circ + 90^circ = 180^circ ] - An angle of (180^circ) implies that (A, M, B) are collinear. Hence, (M) must lie on the line segment (AB). 4. **Symmetry and Similar Argument for Point (N)**: - By similar reasoning, considering the angle (angle BNC) and the right angles formed as a result of the circle’s diameter intercepts, it follows that (angle BNC = 180^circ). - Therefore, point (N) is collinear with points (B) and (C), which indicates (N) lies on the line segment (BC). # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that point (M) lies on line (AB) and point (N) lies on line (BC), completing the proof. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Express the quotient 1452_7 div 14_7 in base 7.","completion":"Similar to the original problem, long division in base 7 follows the conventional long division method but adapted for base 7.

Thus, we have: begin{align*} b+c &= sin B + sin C &= sin B + sinleft(frac{2pi}{3} - Bright) &= sin B + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos B + frac{1}{2}sin B &= frac{3}{2}sin B + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos B &= sqrt{3}sinleft(B+ frac{pi}{6}right). end{align*} Given that angle B belongs to the interval left(frac{pi}{2}, frac{2pi}{3}right), then B + frac{pi}{6} belongs to left(frac{2pi}{3}, frac{5pi}{6}right). This means that sinleft(B + frac{pi}{6}right) falls within the range left(frac{1}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right). Thus, the range for b+c can be expressed as left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot sqrt{3}, frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot 2 right) = left(frac{3}{2}, 3frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right).

According to the problem, ( c = 1.0 ) mph. When the boat is traveling downstream, its effective speed is ( v + c ), because the current is helping it along. When it's traveling upstream, its effective speed is ( v - c ), because the current is against it. Let's denote the distance traveled downstream as ( d ) miles. The time it takes to travel downstream is given as 4 hours, and the time to travel upstream is 6 hours. Using the formula ( text{distance} = text{speed} times text{time} ), we can write two equations: 1. For the downstream trip: ( d = (v + c) times 4 ) 2.

We break the (7 times 7) grid into five sub-rectangles: - Four rectangles of size (3 times 4), which cover (4 times 3 = 12) cells each. - One (1 times 1) square. 3. **Coloring Strategy:** Now, consider the impact of coloring different numbers of cells black: - **Case with 3 black cells:** Coloring only 3 cells won’t be sufficient because it’s possible to find a (3 times 4) rectangle (with 12 cells) that remains entirely white. This contradicts the requirement to avoid any white rectangle with at least 10 white cells. - **Case with 4 black cells:** The goal is to find a way to place these 4 black cells such that no (3 times 4) rectangle remains entirely white (with 12 cells). 4. **Placement Method:** Following a particular strategic placement can achieve this: Suppose we place black cells systematically. For simplicity, consider the (3 times 4) sub-rectangles and ensure each such area is impacted: - Place a black cell in position (1,1) of the first (3 times 4) rectangle. - Place a black cell in position (3,2) of the second (3 times 4) rectangle. - Place a black cell in position (5,3) of the third (3 times 4) rectangle. - Place a black cell in position (7,4) of the fourth (3 times 4) rectangle. Placing these 4 black cells in specific positions disrupts any potential formation of a white (3 times 4) rectangle, covering different columns and rows across sub-rectangles. 5. **Conclusion:** By placing the 4 black cells as illustrated, the grid is restricted from having any significant white area (10 cells in rectangle form).

Each face needs a sum of two from its edges. Step 2: Counting Valid Labelings for One Face Initially focus on one face: - Select 2 edges to label '1' from 4 edges of a face: binom{4}{2} = 6 combinations. Step 3: Extending to Adjacent Faces Adjacent faces share edges, and the labels must be consistent across shared edges. If two edges are labeled '1' for one face, these labels affect its adjacent faces. Step 4: Valid Combinations Across the Prism Start with a single face and extend labeling consistently while checking valid sums for each adjacent face.

This model helps in visualizing and verifying connections to maintain two '1' labels per face condition.

The percentage error in the area is the sum of the percentage errors in the length and width because when multiplying two quantities, the percentage errors add up. Total percentage error in the area = Error in length + Error in width Total percentage error in the area = 6% (excess) + 3% (deficit) However, since the width error is in deficit, it will actually reduce the total area. So, we need to subtract the width error from the length error to get the total error in the area: Total percentage error in the area = 6% - 3% = 3% Therefore, the total percentage error in the calculated area of the square, considering the changes in temperature and humidity, is boxed{3%} ."},{"prompt":"Alvin is selling his marble set.

After each step, the minimum value of the multiset increases at least by a factor of ( frac{2}{k} ). 5. **Halving Steps Count**: - After each step, we reduce the count of elements by at most ( 2 ).

Since the distance is the same for both teams, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other: ( 20t = 25(t - 3) ) Now, we solve for ( t ): ( 20t = 25t - 75 ) Subtract ( 25t ) from both sides: ( -5t = -75 ) Divide both sides by ( -5 ): ( t = 15 ) So, Team B took 15 hours to complete the course.

He wins if the sum of the dice after rerolling is exactly 7. We need to find the probability that he chooses to reroll exactly two dice to optimize his chances of winning. 2. **Probability of Winning with Two Dice**: If Jason decides to keep one die with value a and reroll the other two, the sum of the rerolled dice needs to be 7 - a. The number of favorable outcomes for two dice to sum to s (where s leq 7) is s - 1. Thus, the probability that two dice sum to s is frac{s - 1}{36}.

If the branches of the graphs y=P(x) and y=Q(x) are directed to the same side (both upwards or both downwards), then the quadratic polynomial P(x)+Q(x) does not have roots because all its values are of the same sign and non-zero. This contradicts the assumption that P(x)+Q(x) has a double root. 3. If the branches of the graphs y=P(x) and y=Q(x) are directed to different sides, then in the points a and b, the polynomial P(x)+Q(x) takes values of different signs, which is impossible for a polynomial with a double root (because it would imply a change of sign and hence multiple roots closer together). This also leads to a contradiction. 4. Therefore, the assumption that a neq b must be false, meaning a=b. Second Solution 1. Let c and d be the double roots of the quadratics P(x) and Q(x) respectively. 2. Let a and b be the leading coefficients of P(x) and Q(x) respectively. 3. We can write: [ P(x) = a(x - c)^2 quad text{and} quad Q(x) = b(x - d)^2 ] 4. Then, P(x)+Q(x)=a(x-c)^2 + b(x-d)^2. 5.

Since a neq 0 and b neq 0, it follows that (c-d)^2 = 0 implying c = d. 8. Therefore, all three polynomials P(x), Q(x), and P(x)+Q(x) have the same double root c. Third Solution 1. A quadratic polynomial with a double root can be written as a perfect square; without loss of generality, let P(x) = R(x)^2. 2. Consider two cases for Q(x). - Case 1: Q(x) = S(x)^2. Then, [ P(x) + Q(x) = R(x)^2 + S(x)^2 ] This expression only equals zero at a common root of R(x) and S(x). Thus, P(x) and Q(x) share the same root. - Case 2: Q(x) = -S(x)^2. Then, [ P(x) + Q(x) = R(x)^2 - S(x)^2 = (R(x) - S(x))(R(x) + S(x)) ] For this to have a double root, the roots of the linear factors R(x)-S(x) and R(x)+S(x) must coincide, implying R(x)=S(x)=0 at that root. # Conclusion Thus, all three polynomials P(x), Q(x), and P(x)+Q(x) necessarily have the same double root. boxed{text{Yes}}"},{"prompt":"f x is an integer and 2.134 × 10 ^ x is less than a certain number, and the greatest possible value for x is 3, what is that number?","completion":"If the greatest possible value for x is 3, then we are looking for the smallest number that is greater than 2.134 × 10^3. 2.134 × 10^3 = 2.134 × 1000 = 2134 So, the certain number must be greater than 2134.

So we rewrite the equation as: [ frac{2D}{24} + frac{3D}{24} = 15 ] Combining the fractions, we get: [ frac{5D}{24} = 15 ] Now, we solve for ( D ) by multiplying both sides by 24 and then dividing by 5: [ D = frac{15 times 24}{5} ] [ D = frac{360}{5} ] [ D = 72 ] Therefore, the distance to the place is boxed{72} kilometers."},{"prompt":"Tom has 29 coins made up of 25 cent pieces and some cent pieces.

The total value of the coins is 5.45, which is 545 cents. The value of the 25 cent pieces (Q) is 25 cents each, and the value of the 1 cent pieces (P) is 1 cent each.

A: 130 B: 140 C: 150 D: 160","completion":"Given that the distribution of math scores X follows a normal distribution N(110, 10^{2}), we can analyze the problem as follows: 1. The problem states P(100leqslant Xleqslant 110)=0.35. This means that the probability of a score falling between 100 and 110 is 0.35. 2. Due to the symmetry of the normal distribution around its mean (110 in this case), we can infer that P(110leqslant Xleqslant 120) is also 0.35. This is because the intervals [100, 110] and [110, 120] are symmetrically located around the mean. 3. To find the probability of a score being greater than 120, we look at the total probability (which is 1 for any probability distribution) and subtract the probabilities of the scores being less than or equal to 120. Since we have the probabilities for the intervals [100, 110] and [110, 120], and each is 0.35, we can calculate P(X > 120) as follows: [ P(X > 120) = 0.5 - P(110leqslant Xleqslant 120) = 0.5 - 0.35 = 0.15. ] 4.

Let us add n to both sides of the given equation. We aim to show that in the equality obtained, both parts are equal to the number of pairs (k, m) of natural numbers satisfying the inequality k^m leq n. 3. First, let's understand the expressions on the left-hand side of the equation: - The term leftlfloor n^{1/m} rightrfloor represents the number of natural numbers k that satisfy k leq n^{1/m}. This, in turn, is the number of natural numbers k for which k^m leq n. 4. Now, let's analyze the right-hand side of the equation: - The term leftlfloor log_k n rightrfloor represents the number of natural numbers m that satisfy m leq log_k n. This is also the number of natural numbers m for which k^m leq n. 5. More formally, for any real number a geq 1, the greatest integer function leftlfloor a rightrfloor is equal to the number of natural numbers less than or equal to a. 6. Therefore, the term leftlfloor n^{1/m} rightrfloor on the left-hand side counts the number of possible values for k for each m such that k^m leq n. 7. Similarly, the term leftlfloor log_k n rightrfloor on the right-hand side counts the number of possible values for m for each k such that k^m leq n. 8. Consequently, both sides of the original equation are summing terms that count pairs (k, m) satisfying k^m leq n, just in different orders: the left-hand side sums by fixing m and varying k, while the right-hand side sums by fixing k and varying m. # Conclusion: Since both sums count the same set of pairs (k, m) in different orders, they must be equal.

That demonstrates symmetry and equal angles formed with the sides. 7. **Case 3 - Angle at the Base Greater than 90 Degrees:** When ( angle ABD ) exceeds ( 90^circ ): - ( AO ) will again provide equal angles with respect to the sides ( AB ) and ( AC ), maintaining the equality required in the angles formed. 8. **Conclusion:** All three cases demonstrate that the angles formed by the altitude and the circumcircle are preserved under symmetrical properties and isosceles triangle logic. Hence, the angle bisector does indeed divide the angle formed by the altitude and the radius of the circumcircle in half.

We need to determine the maximum number of such triangles that can be intersected by a needle of length 2, considering only those triangles whose interiors the needle meets. 2. **Intersecting Triangles with the Needle**: Let ( L ) represent the union of all the lines forming the edges of the triangles on the floor. As the needle moves across the floor from one end of the needle to the other, it will pass through these lines of the tiling. Each time the needle crosses a line in ( L ), it enters a new triangle. 3. **Direction of the Lines**: Given that each side of the triangles runs in one of three possible directions, our objective is to maximize the number of times the 2-unit needle can cross these lines. These lines are spaced ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ) units apart. 4. **Calculating Maximum Crossings in One Direction**: Since the needle is 2 units long and can cross lines spaced ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ) units apart: [ text{Maximum number of lines crossed in one direction} = leftlfloor frac{2}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{4}{sqrt{3}} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{4}{1.732} rightrfloor approx 2.31 Rightarrow 2 ] Hence, the needle cannot cross more than 2 lines in any given direction. 5. **Considering Different Directions**: The needle, however, can cross lines in multiple directions. - It can cross up to 3 lines in one direction due to a fortunate alignment. - From earlier reasoning, it cannot cross 3 lines in two different directions. This is proven by noting that if it crosses three lines in more than one direction, the endpoints of the needle would be spaced further than the length of the needle (2). 6. **Summing Up Crossings**: Therefore, the maximum intersections the needle can make are: [ 3 , (text{lines in one direction}) + 2 , (text{lines in another direction}) + 2 , (text{lines in the last direction}) = 7 , text{crossings} ] Since crossing a line implies entry into a new triangle and we start in one of the triangles, the number of intersected triangles is: [ 7 + 1 = 8 ] 7. **Feasibility Check**: Finally, this scenario is plausible if the needle intersects lines at the maximum frequency allowed by geometry constraints. **Conclusion**: The largest number of triangles that the needle could intersect is ( boxed{8} )."},{"prompt":"Javier exercised for 50 minutes every day for one week.

So, lfloor x rfloor + lceil x rceil = x + x = 2x. Setting 2x = 7 results in x = frac{7}{2}, which is a non-integer, hence no solution in this case. - **Case 2: x is not an integer.** In this scenario, lfloor x rfloor and lceil x rceil are consecutive integers. Let lfloor x rfloor = n and lceil x rceil = n+1 for some integer n. Then, lfloor x rfloor + lceil x rceil = n + (n+1) = 2n + 1. Solving 2n + 1 = 7 gives 2n = 6, thus n = 3. Therefore, lfloor x rfloor = 3 and lceil x rceil = 4. 4. **Determining the Range for x:** Since lfloor x rfloor = 3 and lceil x rceil = 4, x must satisfy 3 < x < 4. 5. **Conclusion:** The solution set for x is all real numbers strictly between 3 and 4.

There are generally two such tangents possible, provided the circles do not intersect internally. - For every point ( P ) on the parabola, distances to the focus and to the directrix are equal. Thus, the external tangent in this case will be equidistant from ( P_1 ), ( P_2 ), and the focus ( F ). 6. **External Tangents Condition**: - The number of solutions, i.e., possible directrices, equals the number of external tangents shared by ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ), which can be 0 or 2. - There are no common external tangents if and only if one circle is entirely inside the other without touching externally.

That is, there do not exist teams ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) such that ( A ) defeated ( B ), ( B ) defeated ( C ), and ( C ) defeated ( A ). 2. **Implication**: This implies a linear hierarchical order of wins and losses. Specifically, if ( A ) defeated ( B ) and ( B ) defeated ( C ), then ( A ) must also defeat ( C ). This results in a transitive property of wins, where victory chains do not form cycles. 3. **Tournament Hierarchy**: Evaluate the implications of such a hierarchy: - The team with the highest number of points, say ( X ), must have defeated all other teams (since no team scored 7 points and no cyclic relationships exist). - The team with the second-highest number of points, say ( Y ), must have defeated all teams except ( X ). - This pattern continues down to the lowest-ranked team. 4. **Maximum Points Calculation**: Now consider the number of wins: - Since there are 12 teams in the tournament, each team can play against 11 other teams. - The highest-ranked team ( X ) wins all of its 11 matches. - The second-ranked team ( Y ) wins against 10 other teams (losing only to ( X )). - The same reduction pattern applies to the nth-ranked team: it only defeats ( (12 - n - 1) ) other teams. 5. **Contradiction with Problem Constraints**: - According to our assumptions, consider the team ranked 5th.

For example, if the roommate borrows sheets 3, 4, and 5, then c=3 and b=2. 2. **Calculate the Sum of Page Numbers:** The sum of the page numbers up to b sheets is 1+2+3+cdots + 2b.

According to the problem, the fast train takes 4 hours less than the slower train to cover the distance.

Being alone, the dynamics of societal exchange that typically involve money were **entirely absent**. 2. **Utility of Money on the Island:** - In **modern society**, money serves several essential functions: - **Medium of Exchange:** Used to facilitate transactions between parties. - **Store of Value:** Can be saved and retrieved in the future, retaining its value over time. - **Unit of Account:** Provides a common base for prices. - **Standard of Deferred Payment:** Widely accepted way to settle debts. - On the island, **Crusoe found himself in a context where these functions were rendered useless**: - No one was present to engage in exchange. - Physical survival needs (food, water, shelter) couldn't be met with currency. 3. **Loss of Money's Function as a Medium of Exchange:** - **Precisely because Crusoe lacked others to trade with**, the **primary economic function of money**, that is, **serving as a medium of exchange, no longer applied**. - Money loses its essence when there is **no one to transact with**. 4. **Illustrative Example and Realization:** - The exclamation from Crusoe upon finding money: > \\"Useless trash, and what good is it to me now?

The probability of this scenario is: [ P(text{reaching shore via } a_1 text{ and } b_2) = p times q times q = p times q^2. ] 4. **General Case for Subsequent Islands** Extending this logic, if bridges b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n are all destroyed but b_{n+1} remains intact and also bridges a_1, a_2, cdots, a_n remain intact, the probability of being able to reach the shore is: [ P(text{reaching shore via } a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n text{ and } b_{n+1}) = p^n times q^{n+1}. ] 5. **Total Probability Calculation** Since there are infinitely many islands, we need to sum the probabilities of reaching the shore via all possible combinations: [ P(text{total}) = q + p q^2 + p^2 q^3 + p^3 q^4 + cdots ] This is a geometric series of the form: [ sum_{n=0}^{infty} p^n q^{n+1} ] The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by the formula: [ sum_{n=0}^{infty} ar^n = frac{a}{1-r} ] Here, (a = q) and (r = pq), so we substitute these values: [ P(text{total}) = sum_{n=0}^{infty} p^n q^{n+1} = frac{q}{1 - pq} ] 6. **Substitute Given Values** Given (p = 0.5) and (q = 0.5), we plug these into our formula: [ P(text{total}) = frac{0.5}{1 - 0.5 times 0.5} = frac{0.5}{1 - 0.25} = frac{0.5}{0.75} = frac{1}{1.5} = frac{2}{3} ] # Conclusion: The probability that you can reach the shore from the first island after a strong earthquake is: [ boxed{frac{2}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"A vehicle accelerates from a standstill to a speed of 252 kmph in 1.5 hours, then decelerates uniformly to a complete stop in 45 minutes. Calculate the average speed in meters per second during the entire journey.","completion":"First, we need to convert the speeds and times into consistent units. We'll convert kilometers per hour to meters per second and hours to seconds. 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, 252 kmph is equivalent to: 252 km/h * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h) = 70 m/s Now, let's calculate the total distance covered during acceleration and deceleration. During acceleration, the vehicle goes from 0 to 70 m/s in 1.5 hours. The average speed during acceleration is the average of the initial and final speeds: (0 m/s + 70 m/s) / 2 = 35 m/s The time taken to accelerate is 1.5 hours, which is: 1.5 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 5400 seconds The distance covered during acceleration is: Average speed during acceleration * Time taken to accelerate = 35 m/s * 5400 s = 189000 meters During deceleration, the vehicle goes from 70 m/s to 0 m/s in 45 minutes. The average speed during deceleration is again the average of the initial and final speeds: (70 m/s + 0 m/s) / 2 = 35 m/s The time taken to decelerate is 45 minutes, which is: 45 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 2700 seconds The distance covered during deceleration is: Average speed during deceleration * Time taken to decelerate = 35 m/s * 2700 s = 94500 meters The total distance covered during the entire journey is the sum of the distances covered during acceleration and deceleration: 189000 meters + 94500 meters = 283500 meters The total time taken for the entire journey is the sum of the time taken to accelerate and decelerate: 5400 seconds + 2700 seconds = 8100 seconds Finally, the average speed during the entire journey is the total distance divided by the total time: Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 283500 meters / 8100 seconds ≈ 35 m/s Therefore, the average speed during the entire journey is approximately boxed{35} meters per second."},{"prompt":"Given the function fleft(xright)=|x1||2x+4|.

The maximum value of f(x) occurs at x = -2, which gives f(-2) = 3. Hence, the range of f(x) is boxed{left(-infty, 3right]}. Part (2): Proof of the Inequality Given that the maximum value of f(x) is m = 3, and x + y + z = m, we have x + y + z = 3.

Let (M) be the point where diagonals (AC) and (EG) intersect. 2. Consider the triangles (triangle AEM) and (triangle CGM). Using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of two sides and the included angle, we have: [ frac{S_{triangle AEM}}{S_{triangle CGM}} = frac{AM cdot EM sin angle AME}{CM cdot GM sin angle CMG}= frac{AE cdot EM sin angle AEM}{CG cdot GM sin angle CGM} ] 3. Notice that (sin angle AME = sin angle CMG) and (sin angle AEM = sin angle CGM) since (EG) is a straight line. 4. Therefore, from the above ratio, we get: [ frac{AM}{CM} = frac{AE}{CG} ] This implies that the line (EG) divides the diagonal (AC) of the quadrilateral in the ratio (frac{AE}{CG}). 5. By a similar argument, we can show that the line (FK) (joining the points of tangency (F) and (K)) also divides the same diagonal (AC) in the same ratio: [ frac{AK}{CF} ] 6. Now, because (AE = AK) and (CG = CF) (since (E) and (K) are points of tangency on side (AD), and (G) and (F) are points of tangency on side (BC)), we find that: [ frac{AK}{CF} = frac{AE}{CG} ] 7. Consequently, the line (FK) must also pass through the point (M). 8. Finally, applying the same logic and the properties of the tangency points, we can establish that the line (BD) (another diagonal of quadrilateral (ABCD)) also passes through the intersection point of lines (EG) and (FK). Conclusion: The diagonals of the circumscribed quadrilateral and the diagonals determined by the tangency points intersect at the same point, which concludes our proof.

The center of the cube is denoted by ( O ). 2. **Marking Edges:** Paint the edges emanating from vertex ( A ) and ( G ) red, and all other edges blue. 3. **Symmetry and Midpoints:** Any blue edge has its midpoint forming an equilateral triangle with vertices ( A ) and ( G ), due to the congruence of cube faces. Consequently, these midpoints lie in the plane ( S ), which is perpendicular to ( AG ) and passes through ( O ). These midpoints are equidistant from ( O ) and form a regular hexagon in plane ( S ). 4. **Hexagonal Base Pyramids:** Consider two pyramids with a common blue hexagonal base, and with apices at ( A ) and ( G ). The line ( AG ) serves as the axis of symmetry for these pyramids, reflecting them into themselves. 5. **Volume Calculation of Red Tetrahedra:** To proceed with volume calculation, each red tetrahedra has a base, for example ( ABPQ ), with ( P ) and ( Q ) being midpoints of edges ( BC ) and ( BF ), respectively. Upon reflection across ( AG ), these points transform to ( R ) and ( T ), the midpoints of ( EH ) and ( DH ) respectively. 6. **Volume by Reflection:** The reflection justifies that the tetrahedra formed are outside the reflected cubes but congruent in construction.

The time taken to go to school is the distance divided by the speed at which he goes to school. So, the time taken to go to school is ( frac{6}{3} ) hours, which simplifies to 2 hours. Since the total time for the round trip is 5 hours, the time taken to return home must be ( 5 - 2 = 3 ) hours. Now, we can use the formula for speed, which is distance divided by time, to find the speed at which he returns home. ( v = frac{text{distance}}{text{time}} ) The distance he needs to cover to return home is the same as the distance to school, which is 6 km. The time taken to return home is 3 hours.
