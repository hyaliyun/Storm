Notice that T' is also a subset of S. 4. **Relationship Between Alternating Sums of T and T':** The alternating sum of T can be written as: [ text{AltSum}(T) = 7 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + cdots pm a_k ] where a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k are the elements of T' arranged in decreasing order. The alternating sum of T' is: [ text{AltSum}(T') = a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - cdots pm a_k ] Adding these two sums, we get: [ text{AltSum}(T) + text{AltSum}(T') = (7 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + cdots pm a_k) + (a_1 - a_2 + a_3 - cdots pm a_k) = 7 ] 5. **Counting Subsets Containing 7:** There are 2^6 subsets of S that contain the element 7, because each of the remaining 6 elements can either be included or not included in the subset independently. 6. **Summing the Alternating Sums:** Since each pair (T, T') contributes 7 to the total sum, and there are 2^6 such pairs, the total sum of all alternating sums for subsets containing 7 is: [ 7 times 2^6 = 7 times 64 = 448 ] The final answer is boxed{448}"},{"prompt":"Gavrila found out that the front tires of a car last for 24,000 km, and the rear tires last for 36,000 km.

[ D = X + Y ] 10. **Substitute (Y) from the equations:** - From (24,000 - X = Y), we get (Y = 24,000 - X). - Therefore (D = X + (24,000 - X) = 24,000). 11. **Verification of maximum distance with full tire utilization:** - Ensure that the initially rear tires (36,000 capacity) indeed provide more balance during wear. - Setting (Y) equalized the distance balance: - So the switched duration totals (X + Y leq 36,000), validating all conditions align correctly towards (D = 28,800).

Since speed and time are inversely proportional (when the distance is constant), we can set up the following equation: ( frac{S}{T} = frac{frac{4}{5}S}{T + 15} ) This equation states that the ratio of her usual speed to her usual time is equal to the ratio of her reduced speed to the increased time it takes when she walks slower. Now we can solve for ( T ): ( S cdot (T + 15) = frac{4}{5}S cdot T ) Divide both sides by ( S ) to cancel out the speed (since it's the same distance, the speed will not affect the time ratio): ( T + 15 = frac{4}{5}T ) Now multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction: ( 5T + 75 = 4T ) Subtract ( 4T ) from both sides: ( T = 75 ) So, it usually takes the worker boxed{75} minutes to cover the distance between her home and her office."},{"prompt":"What is the maximum possible length of a sequence of natural numbers ( x_1, x_2, x_3, ldots ) such that ( x_i leq 1998 ) for ( i geq 1 ), and ( x_i = |x_{i1} x_{i2}| ) for ( i geq 3 )?","completion":"To find the maximum possible length of a sequence ( x_1, x_2, x_3, ldots ) such that ( x_i leq 1998 ) for all ( i geq 1 ), and ( x_i = |x_{i-1} - x_{i-2}| ) for ( i geq 3 ), we need to analyze the properties of such sequences. 1. **Determine General Behavior of Sequences:** The sequence is completely determined by its first two elements ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ).

The store marked up its cost by some percentage, which we'll call M (expressed as a decimal). So the initial retail price (P1) of the sweater was: P1 = C + CM P1 = C(1 + M) During the New Year season, the store marked up its prices by 25% of the original retail price.

Since ( z ) takes values in ([-3, frac{3}{2}]), we need to find the corresponding values for ( u ): [ u in left[ frac{pi}{9} cdot (-3), frac{pi}{9} cdot frac{3}{2} right] = left[ -frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{6} right]. ] 7. **Cosine Function Range:** - Finally, we need the range of values for the function ( f(x) = cos u ) for ( u in left[ -frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{6} right] ): [ cos left( -frac{pi}{3} right) = frac{1}{2}, quad cos left( frac{pi}{6} right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. ] - Since ( cos u ) decreases from ( 1 ) to ( frac{1}{2} ) and then increases to ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ), we take the minimum and maximum: [ E_f = left[ frac{1}{2}, 1 right]. ] # Conclusion [ boxed{[0.5, 1]} ]"},{"prompt":"Multiply (y^4 + 9y^2 + 81)(y^2 9).","completion":"This problem resembles the original setup but with different terms.

A monic polynomial is a polynomial whose leading coefficient is 1. 2. **Case for Degree 0 and 1**: - For ( deg(P(x)) = 0 ), ( P(x) ) is a constant polynomial. Let ( P(x) = c ). Then ( P(x)^2 - 1 = c^2 - 1 ). For ( P(x+1) = c ) to divide ( c^2 - 1 ), ( c ) must be ( pm 1 ). Since ( P(x) ) is monic, ( c = 1 ). Thus, ( P(x) = 1 ). - For ( deg(P(x)) = 1 ), let ( P(x) = x + b ). Then ( P(x+1) = x + b + 1 ) and ( P(x)^2 - 1 = (x + b)^2 - 1 = (x + b - 1)(x + b + 1) ). Clearly, ( P(x+1) = x + b + 1 ) divides ( (x + b - 1)(x + b + 1) ). 3. **Claim: All Roots of ( P(x) ) are the Same**: Suppose ( P(x) ) has degree ( n ge 2 ). We can write ( P(x) = prod_{i=1}^n (x - z_i) ) where ( z_i ) are the roots of ( P ). Without loss of generality, assume ( text{Re}(z_1) le text{Re}(z_2) le dots le text{Re}(z_n) ). 4. **Evaluating ( |P(z_i - 1)| = 1 )**: Since ( P(x+1) ) divides ( P(x)^2 - 1 ), for any root ( z_i ) of ( P ), ( P(z_i - 1) = 0 ). Thus, ( |P(z_i - 1)| = 1 ). We have: [ 1 = |P(z_1 - 1)| = left| prod_{i=1}^n (z_1 - 1 - z_i) right| = prod_{i=1}^n |z_1 - 1 - z_i| ] Since ( text{Re}(z_1 - z_i - 1) le -1 ), we have ( |z_1 - z_i - 1| ge 1 ). Therefore: [ prod_{i=1}^n |z_1 - 1 - z_i| ge prod_{i=1}^n 1 = 1 ] Equality must hold, implying ( |z_1 - z_i - 1| = 1 ) for all ( i ). This forces ( z_1 = z_i ) for all ( i ), meaning all roots are the same. 5. **Form of ( P(x) )**: Since all roots are the same, ( P(x) = (x - c)^n ) for some constant ( c ). 6. **Divisibility Condition**: We need ( P(x+1) = (x - c + 1)^n ) to divide ( P(x)^2 - 1 = ((x - c)^n)^2 - 1 ). Notice: [ P(x)^2 - 1 = ((x - c)^n)^2 - 1 = ((x - c)^n - 1)((x - c)^n + 1) ] Since ( gcd((x - c)^n - 1, (x - c)^n + 1) = 1 ), ( P(x+1) ) must divide either ( (x - c)^n - 1 ) or ( (x - c)^n + 1 ).

Thus, ( P(x) = x + b ) for some ( b in mathbb{Z} ). Conclusion: The only monic polynomials ( P(x) ) such that ( P(x)^2 - 1 ) is divisible by ( P(x+1) ) are ( P(x) = 1 ) and ( P(x) = x + b ) for any ( b in mathbb{Z} ).

Hence, all the faces of the parallelepiped are rectangles. This implies the parallelepiped is a rectangular one. 3. **Description of tetrahedron and faces**: Since the tetrahedron is constructed within a rectangular parallelepiped, it is possible to describe a sphere around the parallelepiped passing through all vertices of the tetrahedron.

Since (10^{2k} = 2^{2k} cdot 5^{2k}), any number that is a multiple of (2^{2k}) modulo (10^{2k}) can be written as (m cdot 2^{2k}) where (m) is an integer. 3. **Range of Residues**: We need to find a power of (2) such that the last (2k) digits of (2^n) are (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k).

Consider the vertices of a regular hexagon with side length 1. Let the vertices of the hexagon be labeled as A, B, C, D, E, and F following a cyclic order such that each consecutive pair of vertices is one unit apart. We need to assign colors to these vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. 2. Assign colors 1, 2, and 3 to the points A, B, and C respectively. However, since each side of the hexagon is one unit: - The segment AB requires A and B to have different colors. - The segment BC requires B and C to have different colors. Since A, B, and C are already colored as 1, 2, and 3, respectively: 3. Assign color to D: - Point D is adjacent to both C and one unassigned vertex E. - Without loss of generality, assume the configuration such that vertex D will also be adjacent to both vertices apart by unit distance. 4. Now note that in the new configuration: - To avoid any vertex C comes same as vertex A. - Similarly D assigned to one color contradicts adjacency property hence requiring different colors. This assignment forces vertex D must be same as A: contradiction. This forces the vertices in configuration require 4 distinct colors, showing chi geq 4: direct contradiction. 5. **Proof for chi leq 7:** To show that chi leq 7, we can construct a valid 7-coloring of the plane. This can be done by tiling the plane with regular hexagons each of side length 1 unit (equivalent to placing unit circles in beehive hexagonal patterns): 6. Start coloring the hexagon by: - Pick a random hexagon assign it color 1. - Its six neighbouring hexagons assign colors 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. - Each subsequent neighbouring hexagon is assigned colors based on initial polygons grouped into symmetric groups 18. 7. For verification process - Compute each hexagon existing assigned colors distance apart from each other hexagon minimum twice the assigned thresholds. - Such computed distance ensures multiple of each color symmetry determine no intersection overlap. Since each colored hexagon disproves any unit distance thereafter among every possible pair of points we conclude: 7-color tiling resulting in valid coloring such that no same color pair separated by 1 unit. 8.

The cost of plastering is 409.20 at a rate of 55 paise per square meter. First, we need to convert the cost to the same units as the rate, which is in paise. Since 1 rupee is equal to 100 paise, we have: 409.20 rupees = 409.20 * 100 paise/rupee = 40920 paise Now, we can find the total area plastered by dividing the total cost by the rate per square meter: Total area = Total cost / Rate per square meter Total area = 40920 paise / 55 paise/sq m Total area = 744 sq m The total area plastered includes the bottom and the walls of the tank. The bottom area is simply the length times the width, and the wall area includes both the two longer walls and the two shorter walls. Let's denote the width of the tank as W meters.

We can use the sum of angles formula for sine to express it: sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right) = sin α cos frac {π}{4} + cos α sin frac {π}{4}. Knowing that cos frac {π}{4} = sin frac {π}{4} = frac {sqrt{2}}{2}, we can substitute those values into the expression: sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right) = sin α frac {sqrt{2}}{2} + cos α frac {sqrt{2}}{2}. Using the half-angle identities for sine and cosine, we know that sin^2 α = frac {1 - cos 2α}{2} and cos^2 α = frac {1 + cos 2α}{2}.

Returning to our expression for sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right), and noting that sin α and cos α must both be positive within the given interval: sinleft(α+ frac {π}{4}right) = left(sqrt{frac {2 - sqrt{3}}{4}} + sqrt{frac {2 + sqrt{3}}{4}} right) frac {sqrt{2}}{2}.

The width of the table can be represented in two different ways: - First, by summing the distances from the left edge of the table to the center of the plate and from the center of the plate to the right edge of the table: [ text{Width of the table} = 63 + frac{d}{2} + frac{d}{2} + 20 = 63 + d + 20 ] - Second, by summing the distances from the left edge of the table directly: [ text{Width of the table} = 10 + d + x ] 4. Setting these two expressions for the width of the table equal, we have: [ 63 + d + 20 = 10 + d + x ] 5. Since ( d ), the diameter of the plate, is common in both expressions, it cancels out from both sides of the equation: [ 63 + 20 = 10 + x ] 6. Simplifying the equation, we get: [ 83 = 10 + x ] 7.

So the formula simplifies to: A = P(1 + r)^t For 2 years (t = 2), the amount A is Rs. 8820: 8820 = P(1 + r)^2 For 3 years (t = 3), the amount A is Rs. 9261: 9261 = P(1 + r)^3 Now we have two equations with two unknowns (P and r). We can solve these equations to find the values of P and r. First, let's divide the second equation by the first one to eliminate P: (9261 / 8820) = (P(1 + r)^3) / (P(1 + r)^2) This simplifies to: (9261 / 8820) = (1 + r) Now we can solve for r: 1 + r = 9261 / 8820 r = (9261 / 8820) - 1 r = 9261 / 8820 - 8820 / 8820 r = (9261 - 8820) / 8820 r = 441 / 8820 r = 1 / 20 r = 0.05 (or 5% when expressed as a percentage) Now that we have the rate, we can substitute it back into either of the original equations to find P. Let's use the first equation: 8820 = P(1 + 0.05)^2 8820 = P(1.05)^2 8820 = P * 1.1025 P = 8820 / 1.1025 P = 8000 So the principal amount (the sum of money put at compound interest) is Rs. boxed{8000} ."},{"prompt":"(B.Frenkin, A.Zaslavsky) A convex quadrilateral was drawn on the blackboard.

The coefficient m^{2}+4m+4 can be rewritten using the perfect square formula: [ m^{2}+4m+4 = (m+2)^{2} = 1 ] However, there seems to be a slight misunderstanding in the solution provided. The correct interpretation should be that since the function is monotonically decreasing, we focus on the exponent m+2.

Thus, we deduce: [ m+2 lt 0 implies m lt -2 ] Given the initial equation provided was not directly related to finding m from a quadratic equation but rather determining the behavior of f(x) based on its monotonically decreasing nature, we directly proceed to the condition m lt -2.

His old bills used to be 600 dollars a week but he decided to add a personal trainer that costs a certain amount per week. He has 980 dollars leftover a week. How much does Mark's personal trainer cost per week?","completion":"First, let's calculate Mark's new hourly wage after the 5% raise. His old hourly wage was 40. A 5% raise on 40 is calculated as follows: 5% of 40 = (5/100) * 40 = 2 So, his new hourly wage is: 40 + 2 = 42 per hour Next, let's calculate his weekly earnings with the new hourly wage. Since he works 8 hours per day for 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are: 42 * 8 hours/day * 5 days/week = 42 * 40 hours/week = 1680 per week Now, let's calculate his weekly expenses including his old bills and the cost of the personal trainer. We know he has 980 leftover after paying his bills and the personal trainer, so we can set up the following equation to find the total weekly expenses (E): Total earnings - Total expenses = Leftover money 1680 - E = 980 Solving for E, we get: E = 1680 - 980 = 700 The total weekly expenses include his old bills and the cost of the personal trainer. Since his old bills were 600 per week, we can find the cost of the personal trainer by subtracting the old bills from the total weekly expenses: Cost of personal trainer = Total weekly expenses - Old bills Cost of personal trainer = 700 - 600 = 100 Therefore, Mark's personal trainer costs boxed{100} per week."},{"prompt":"Carly is making burgers for a neighborhood BBQ.

What is the ratio of guests who want 2 burgers to the total number of guests?","completion":"Let's start by calculating the total number of burgers Carly needs to cook. Since it takes 4 minutes to cook one side of a burger and each burger needs to be cooked on both sides, it takes 4 + 4 = 8 minutes to cook one burger completely. Carly can cook 5 burgers at once, so in 8 minutes, she cooks 5 burgers. She has 72 minutes to cook all the burgers, so the total number of burgers she can cook in that time is: (72 minutes / 8 minutes per batch) * 5 burgers per batch = 9 batches * 5 burgers per batch = 45 burgers Now, let's denote the number of guests who want 2 burgers as x and the number of guests who want 1 burger as y. We know that the total number of guests is 30, so we have: x + y = 30 (Equation 1) We also know that the total number of burgers is 45, and since guests who want 2 burgers will take 2 each and guests who want 1 burger will take 1 each, we have: 2x + y = 45 (Equation 2) Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously. Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to find the value of x: (2x + y) - (x + y) = 45 - 30 2x + y - x - y = 15 x = 15 Now that we have the value of x, we can find the value of y by substituting x back into Equation 1: x + y = 30 15 + y = 30 y = 30 - 15 y = 15 So, there are 15 guests who want 2 burgers and 15 guests who want 1 burger.

This is asking for the conditional probability of B given A, which is denoted as P(B|A). The formula for conditional probability is: [P(B|A) = frac{P(A cap B)}{P(A)}] Given that P(A) = 0.8 and the intersection of A and B, P(A cap B), is essentially the probability of B since B cannot happen without A, we have P(A cap B) = P(B) = 0.6. Substituting these values into the formula gives: [P(B|A) = frac{P(A cap B)}{P(A)} = frac{0.6}{0.8} = frac{6}{8} = 0.75] Therefore, the probability that the cathode ray tube of a television that has already been switched on and off 10,000 times can continue to be used until 15,000 times is 0.75.

This can be represented by saying that the torque due to the weight and buoyancy of the cast iron ball should equal the torque due to the weight and buoyancy of the wooden ball. 2. **Evaluating Densities and Volumes**: [ rho_{text{q}} > rho_{text{Д}} implies V_{text{ч}} < V_{text{д}} ] Given the relationship of volumes, it follows from the property that densities are inversely proportional to their respective volumes (given a constant mass). 3. **Position Adjustment for Balance**: Since (m_{text{ч}} < m_{text{д}}), the wooden ball exerts more torque than the cast iron ball if the fulcrum is at the midpoint. To achieve equilibrium, we need to shift the fulcrum towards the wooden ball to balance the increased torque from the heavier wooden ball. # Conclusion: To balance the system, the point of support (fulcrum) must be moved towards the wooden ball (since the wooden ball has a greater mass and volume compared to the cast iron ball).

The exponent frac{3}{4} can be distributed to both the 3 and the (-5)^2 inside the parentheses, but since 3 is a constant and raising a constant to a power does not change its value, we will keep the 3 as it is. Now we focus on (-5)^2. As per exponent rules, (a^m)^n = a^{mn}, so we rewrite (-5)^2 as (-5)^{2 cdot frac{3}{4}} = (-5)^{frac{6}{4}} = (-5)^{frac{3}{2}}. Next, we apply the exponent rule for negative numbers. According to this rule, (-a)^{frac{m}{n}} = a^{frac{m}{n}} if frac{m}{n} is even, and -a^{frac{m}{n}} if frac{m}{n} is odd. In this case, since frac{3}{2} is odd, we have (-5)^{frac{3}{2}} = -(5^{frac{3}{2}}). Putting it all together, we get: 3(-5)^{2 ,^{frac{3}{4}}} = 3left(-(5^{frac{3}{2}})right) = -3(5^{frac{3}{2}}) Now, we can calculate the value of 5^{frac{3}{2}} by using the exponent rule (a^m)^n = a^{mn} once again. We get 5^{frac{3}{2}} = (5^2)^{frac{3}{4}} = 25^{frac{3}{4}}. Finally, we evaluate 25^{frac{3}{4}} to find the final answer. Since 25 = 5^2, we can write 25^{frac{3}{4}} = (5^2)^{frac{3}{4}} = 5^{frac{2 cdot 3}{4}} = 5^{frac{6}{4}} = 5^{frac{3}{2}}. So the expression simplifies to: 3(-5)^{2 ,^{frac{3}{4}}} = -3(5^{frac{3}{2}}) We can further simplify this expression by calculating 5^{frac{3}{2}}. Since 5^{frac{3}{2}} = 5^{frac{1}{2}} cdot 5, we have: 5^{frac{3}{2}} = sqrt{5} cdot 5 = 5sqrt{5} Now, we can calculate the final value of the expression: -3(5^{frac{3}{2}}) = -3(5sqrt{5}) = boxed{-15sqrt{5}}"},{"prompt":"Given a complex number z=frac{{2+3i}}{{1+2i}}, the point corresponding to z in the complex plane is located in which quadrant?

The domain of this function is {x | x neq 0} because we cannot have x=0 due to division by zero in the denominator when considering the reciprocal power. To check if it's an odd function, we need f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain. However, since the domain does not include 0, and the function does not satisfy the odd function condition across the entire set of real numbers mathbb{R}, option A is incorrect. **Option B: m=1, n=2** For option B, we have f(x)={x}^{frac{1}{2}}, which is the square root of x. The domain of this function is left[0,+infty right) because square roots of negative numbers are not real.

If an arithmetic progression contains an ( r )-th power and an ( s )-th power, then it contains an ( rs )-th power. 3. **Proof of the theorem:** Let ( a ) and ( d ) be integers representing the first term and the common difference of the arithmetic progression, respectively. Suppose there exist integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( a equiv x^r pmod{d} ) and ( a equiv y^s pmod{d} ).

Therefore, we can express a_{13} and a_{7} in terms of a_{4}: a_{13} = a_{4} + 3d = 2a_{4} (since frac{a_{7}}{a_{4}}=2 Rightarrow a_{7} = 2a_{4}, and a_{13} = a_{7} + 3d = 2a_{4} + 3d = 2a_{4} + 3(a_{4}) = 5a_{4}) a_{7} = 2a_{4} Substituting these expressions into the equation for frac{S_{13}}{S_{7}}, we get: frac{S_{13}}{S_{7}} = frac{13(a_{1} + 5a_{4})}{7(a_{1} + 2a_{4})} = frac{13 cdot 2a_{4}}{7 cdot a_{4}} = frac{26}{7}.

The total amount saved by the couple in 6 months is the sum of the husband's weekly savings and the wife's weekly savings. Since there are 4 weeks in each month, there are 4 * 6 = 24 weeks in 6 months. The total amount saved by the wife in 6 months is 24 * 225. The total amount saved by the husband in 6 months is 24 * H. The total savings of the couple is then: Total savings = (24 * H) + (24 * 225) They decided to divide half of their savings among their four children, and each child receives 1680. Therefore, the total amount given to the children is 4 * 1680. Half of the couple's savings is equal to the total amount given to the children: 1/2 * Total savings = 4 * 1680 Now we can set up the equation: (24 * H) + (24 * 225) = 2 * (4 * 1680) Solving for H: 24H + 24 * 225 = 2 * 4 * 1680 24H + 5400 = 2 * 6720 24H + 5400 = 13440 24H = 13440 - 5400 24H = 8040 H = 8040 / 24 H = 335 The husband gives boxed{335} every week to the savings account."},{"prompt":"Person A is two years older than person B, who is twice as old as person C.

G is the sum of B's and E's ages: g = b + e The total age of all persons is 292: 7. a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 292 Now, let's express everything in terms of b and e, since we have direct relationships for a, c, and d in terms of b and e. From equation 2, we have c = b/2. From equation 1, we have a = b + 2. From equation 3, we have d = 2c = b (since c = b/2). From equation 4, we have e = d + 3 = b + 3 (since d = b).

Since 1+i is in the denominator, its conjugate is 1-i. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator of the left-hand side by 1-i: frac {2+ai}{1+i} cdot frac {1-i}{1-i} = (3+i) cdot frac {1-i}{1-i} Now, distribute the numerators and simplify the denominators: frac {(2+ai)(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)} = frac {(3+i)(1-i)}{1^2 - i^2} Here, we use the difference of squares in the denominator: 1^2 - i^2 = 1-(-1) = 2. So, we get: frac {2 - 2i + ai - ai^2}{2} = frac {3 - 3i + i - i^2}{2} Remember that i^2 = -1, so let's plug that in: frac {2 - 2i + ai + a}{2} =frac {3 - 3i + i + 1}{2} Simplifying both sides, we get: frac {2 + a - 2i + ai}{2} = frac {4 - 2i}{2} Multiply through by 2 to eliminate the fractions: 2 + a - 2i + ai = 4 - 2i Equating the real parts and the imaginary parts from both sides of the equation, because two complex numbers are equal only if their respective real and imaginary parts are equal, yields two separate equations: For the real parts: 2+a = 4, And for the imaginary parts: -2i + ai = -2i. From the equation for the real parts, solving for a we find: a = 4 - 2 a = 2 But looking careful at the equation for imaginary parts -2i + ai = -2i should actually lead to: ai = 0 Then, adding 2i to both sides yields: a = 0 However, this contradicts the result we got from the real part equation, which means we made a mistake. Rechecking the calculations, we see that the error comes from not properly distributing ai in the imaginary part. Let's re-do this step correctly: For the real parts: 2+a = 4, And for the imaginary parts: -2 + a = -2. Upon fixing this, now the equation for the real parts yields the correct value of a: a = 4 - 2 a = 2 For the imaginary parts, after correcting, we see that a should indeed be: a = 2 Here, we've found a conflict. The options don't list 2 as an answer, which suggests a mistake in my calculations. I need to carefully re-evaluate the steps to ensure the proper distribution and combination of terms. Let's go back and solve the equation for the imaginary parts properly: Compare both imaginary parts: -2i + ai = -2i This simplifies to: ai = 0 Since we know a is a real number and i is the imaginary unit, the only way for this product to be zero is if a = 0. But this contradicts the result from the real parts equation. The contradiction arises from the fact that we actually didn't get ai = 0 from the correct distribution. The original equation, upon proper distribution, should have been: 2 - 2i + ai - ai^2 = 4 - 2i We should have: ai - 2i = -2i When we solve this, we should get: ai = 0 But this is incorrect, we should obtain from the imaginary parts that a needs to satisfy the equation: a - 2 = -2 Which, when solving for a, gives us: a = 0 But this is not consistent with the real part of a. Clearly, I've made a mistake again in the simplification of imaginary parts. Let's carefully revisit that step. The imaginary parts actually should give us: -2 + a = -2 Adding 2 to each side of the equation gives us: a = 0 + 2 a = 2 Unfortunately, this is still not an option in our multiple choice answers and conflicts with the real part calculation, which correctly showed a = 2. This means we need to recheck our calculations step by step once more.

For f(x) to have two extreme points, f'(x)=0 must have two distinct real roots. This translates to solving -a=xe^{x} for x. Let's define a new function g(x)=xe^{x} and find its derivative: g'(x)=frac{d}{dx}[xe^{x}] = (x+1)e^{x}. Analyzing g'(x): - For x<-1, g'(x)<0, meaning g(x) is strictly decreasing. - For x>-1, g'(x)>0, meaning g(x) is strictly increasing. At x=-1, g(x) reaches its minimum value: g(-1)=-frac{1}{e}. For -a=xe^{x} to have two real roots, the value of -a must be in the range of g(x), excluding its minimum. Thus, we have: -frac{1}{e}<-a<0 implies 0<a<frac{1}{e}. Therefore, the range of a for f(x) to have two extreme points is: boxed{(0,frac{1}{e})}. Part (2): Finding the range of a for f(x)geqslant 2sin x when xgeqslant 0 Let h(x)=(x-1)e^{x}+ax-2sin x+1.

Considering h'(0)=a-2, we analyze two cases: 1. **When ageqslant 2**: h'(x)geqslant h'(0)geqslant 0, implying h(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, h(x)geqslant h(0)=0 for all xgeqslant 0, satisfying the condition. Hence, ageqslant 2 is part of the solution. 2. **When a<2**: We find that h'(3-a)>0 due to the analysis showing h'(x) is monotonically increasing. However, since h'(0)<0, there exists x_{0}in (0,3-a) such that h'(x_{0})=0. For 0<x<x_{0}, h(x) is decreasing, leading to h(x)<h(0)=0, which contradicts the condition.

The total amount Roshini gave to his friends is ( 3.40 + 4.30 + 1.50 = 9.20 ) dollars. The total amount Roshini spent, including the sales tax, is the initial ( 10.50 ) dollars he had minus the ( 9.20 ) dollars he gave to his friends, which is ( 10.50 - 9.20 = 1.30 ) dollars. The sales tax is 8%, so the cost before tax (and after the discount for Roshini's sweets) is ( frac{1.30}{1.08} ). Let's calculate that: ( frac{1.30}{1.08} = frac{130}{108} approx 1.2037 ) dollars (rounded to four decimal places). This ( 1.2037 ) dollars is what Roshini paid after his 10% discount on his sweets, so it represents ( 0.9R ). To find the original cost of Roshini's sweets before the discount, we divide ( 1.2037 ) by ( 0.9 ): ( R = frac{1.2037}{0.9} approx frac{120.37}{90} approx 1.3374 ) dollars (rounded to four decimal places). Now, we know that the total cost of the sweets before the sales tax and discounts is ( R + F_1 + F_2 + F_3 ), and we have already established that ( F_1 + F_2 + F_3 = 9.20 ) dollars. So, the total cost before the sales tax and discounts is: ( R + F_1 + F_2 + F_3 = 1.3374 + 9.20 = 10.5374 ) dollars.

An angle is acute if it is less than 90^circ. 2. **Geometric Interpretation:** Consider a circle with center O. The angle angle AOB is formed by the points A and B on the circumference of the circle. For angle AOB to be acute, the minor arc overarc{AB} must subtend an angle less than 90^circ at the center O. 3. **Rotational Symmetry:** Due to the rotational symmetry of the circle, we can fix one point, say A, at any position on the circumference without loss of generality. Let's place A at the topmost point of the circle. 4. **Position of Point B:** For angle AOB to be acute, point B must lie on the minor arc overarc{AB} that subtends an angle less than 90^circ at O. This means B must lie within the semicircle above the horizontal diameter passing through A. 5. **Probability Calculation:** The total circumference of the circle is 360^circ. The arc that subtends an angle of 90^circ at the center is one-fourth of the total circumference, i.e., 90^circ. Therefore, the probability that B lies on this arc is the ratio of the length of this arc to the total circumference.

Now let's consider these two equations: [ a_n + a_{n-1} + ldots + a_1 + a_0 = 0 ] [ 2^n a_n + 2^{n-1} a_{n-1} + ldots + 2 a_1 + a_0 = 0 ] # Step-by-Step Calculation: 3.

To prove that there is a coefficient less than (-1), assume the contrary: all (a_i geq -1). This means each coefficient of (a_i) in the simplified equation is non-negative, with the following ranges: [ a_n (2^n - 1) geq 0, quad a_{n-1} (2^{n-1} - 1) geq 0, quad ldots, quad a_1 geq 0 ] Given that each (a_i) is either ( geq -1) or even positive, the terms ((2^k - 1)) are strictly positive numbers since (2^k > 1) for all (k geq 1). 6. Thus each product ((2^k - 1)a_k) is non-negative: [ (2^n - 1)a_n geq 0, quad (2^{n-1} - 1)a_{n-1} geq 0, quad ldots, quad a_1 geq 0 ] # Conclusion: Since all terms on the left side of equation are non-negative, the sum of these terms can only be zero if and only if all (a_i = 0), which contradicts our assumption that not all coefficients are zero. Therefore, there must exist at least one coefficient that is less than (-1).

First, we factorize the number 2006 into its prime factors: [ 2006 = 2 cdot 17 cdot 59 ] Since 2006 is a product of three distinct prime factors, it is a square-free integer. 2. Given that (I, T, E, S) are distinct positive integers and their product equals 2006, we need to assign the values 2, 17, and 59 to (I, E,) and (S) in some order, and find the value of (T). 3. Since (T) must be a distinct positive integer and the product (ITEST = 2006), the only possible value for (T) that satisfies this condition is 1. This is because any other value for (T) would make the product exceed 2006 or not be a factor of 2006. 4.

In this case, any subset of 3 points might form various types of triangles, some of which may not be obtuse. However, this does not give us concrete analysis. - Consider the scenario where these 5 points form a convex pentagon. This is insightful because there are properties of convex polygons (specifically pentagons) that help us understand the angles involved. 4. **Convex Pentagon Analysis**: - In a convex pentagon, each internal angle is less than 180°, and the sum of the internal angles is (540°). - Any triangle formed by choosing three of these points will have internal angles summing up to (180°). - **Key observation**: If the triangle is obtuse, one angle must be greater than (90°). 5. **Counting Obtuse Triangles in Convex Pentagons**: - In a convex pentagon, some triangles formed by the vertices will naturally include an obtuse angle due to the angles subtended by the convex shape. - It can be established that in the worst case, formed obtuse triangles must account for at least 2 such triangles. The properties of convex polygons when examined in this setup hint that there cannot be fewer than (2) obtuse triangles. 6. **Conclusion**: - In this scenario where points form a convex pentagon, by properties and constraints, the minimum number of obtuse triangles is: boxed{2} quad text{(Option C)}"},{"prompt":"Given the set P={1, frac{a}{b}, b} and the set B={0, a+b, b^2}, and P=B, find the set B.","completion":"From the given information, we know b neq 0.

Prove that there are infinity many primes that divide at least one term of S .","completion":"1. **Lemma:** Let ( S subset mathbb{N} ) be an infinite set and ( T_S = { x + y mid x, y in S, x neq y } ). Then there exist infinitely many prime numbers ( p ) such that for a ( t in T_S ), we have ( p mid t ). **Proof:** We will use induction on ( k ). We will show that if primes ( p_1, ldots, p_k ) are distinct factors from members of the set ( T_S ), then there exists a prime ( p_{k+1} ) distinct from these ( k ) numbers such that for a ( t in T_S ), we have ( p_{k+1} mid t ). 2. **Base Case:** For ( k = 1 ), consider the set ( S ). Since ( S ) is infinite, there must be infinitely many distinct prime factors among the elements of ( S ). Therefore, there exists at least one prime ( p_1 ) such that ( p_1 mid t ) for some ( t in T_S ). 3. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for ( k ). That is, there exist ( k ) distinct primes ( p_1, ldots, p_k ) such that for some ( t in T_S ), ( p_i mid t ) for ( i = 1, ldots, k ). We need to show that there exists a prime ( p_{k+1} ) distinct from ( p_1, ldots, p_k ) such that ( p_{k+1} mid t ) for some ( t in T_S ). 4. Assign a ( k )-tuple ( (alpha_{(i,1)}, ldots, alpha_{(i,k)}) ) to each member ( s_i in S ) such that ( alpha_{(i,j)} = v_{p_j}(s_i) ), where ( v_{p_j}(s_i) ) denotes the ( p_j )-adic valuation of ( s_i ). 5. **Case 1:** If there exists an odd prime ( p_j ) such that the values of ( alpha_{(i,j)} ) are equal for infinitely many ( i in mathbb{N} ), consider the infinite set ( S' subset S ) such that for each member ( s ) of that set, we have ( v_{p_j}(s) = alpha_{(i,j)} ). 6. For each ( s in S' ), define ( s = p_j^{alpha_{(i,j)}} s' ). By the pigeonhole principle, there exist infinitely many numbers ( s_i' ) which are equal and non-zero modulo ( p_j ). The pairwise sum of these numbers has at most ( k-1 ) prime factors (not ( p_j )) among ( p_1, ldots, p_k ). By the induction hypothesis for ( k-1 ), there exists a prime factor distinct from these ( k ) numbers for these chosen numbers from ( T_S ). 7. **Case 2:** Suppose that for each prime ( p_j ) and ( i in mathbb{N} ), there exist only finitely many numbers ( s ) in ( S ) such that ( v_{p_j}(s) = alpha_{(i,j)} ). Then consider an infinite set ( S' subset S ) such that for each member ( s_i, s_j ) of that set, there does not exist ( r le k ) such that ( alpha_{(i,r)} = alpha_{(j,r)} ). 8. As a result, for each arbitrary member of ( S' ), we get: [ v_{p_r}(s_i + s_j) = min(alpha_{(i,r)}, alpha_{(j,r)}) ] Then, obviously by inequalities, ( s_i + s_j ) has a prime factor distinct from ( p_1, ldots, p_k ). The lemma is proved for this case too. 9. **Note:** If one power of prime ( 2 ) repeats infinitely many times among the members of ( S ), then by taking odd factors of these numbers (which are equal modulo ( 4 )), the rest of the proof for this case is similar to the above one. 10. Now, if the members of the set ( S ) have finitely many prime factors ( p_1, ldots, p_k ), then again by induction on ( k ), we will show that the members of ( T ) have infinitely many prime factors in the form ( 4k' + 1 ). 11. Similar to the lemma above, define the ( k )-tuple ( (alpha_{(i,1)}, ldots, alpha_{(i,k)}) ). If there exists a prime ( p_j ) such that the values of ( alpha_{(i,j)} ) are equal for infinitely many ( i ), then by considering these infinite numbers ( s in S ) and ( s = p_j^{alpha_{(i,j)}} s' ), the set of values ( s' ) has ( k-1 ) prime factors distinct from ( p_j ). By our induction hypothesis, their pairwise sum produces infinitely many prime factors in the form ( 4k' + 1 ). 12. Assume otherwise. Then there exists an infinite set ( S' = {s_1, s_2, ldots } subset S ) such that for each ( i > j ) and ( r le k ), we have ( alpha_{(i,r)} > alpha_{(j,r)} ). 13. Since the parity of values ( (alpha_{(i,1)}, ldots, alpha_{(i,k)}) ) has ( 2^k ) different cases, by the pigeonhole principle, one can choose infinitely many members of ( S' ) such that for each chosen ( s_i, s_j ) and ( r ), ( alpha_{(i,r)} ) and ( alpha_{(j,r)} ) have the same parity. 14. As a result, for each chosen ( i > j ), we have: [ s_i + s_j = s_j left( prod p_r^{alpha_{(i,r)} - alpha_{(j,r)}} + 1 right) ] Now, since ( alpha_{(i,r)} - alpha_{(j,r)} ) is even and ( left( frac{-1}{p} right) = 1 ) just for ( p equiv 1 pmod{4} ), all prime factors of values ( s_i + s_j ) from chosen numbers of ( S' ) except ( p_1, ldots, p_k ) are in the form ( 4k' + 1 ). By the lemma, the number of them is infinite. So, we are done.

Step 1: Finding the Mean of ( X(t) ) The mean of ( X(t) ) is given by: [ m_x(t) = mathbb{E}[cos(t+varphi)] ] Using the trigonometric identity for cosine, we can rewrite this as: [ begin{aligned} m_x(t) &= mathbb{E}[cos t cos varphi - sin t sin varphi] &= cos t cdot mathbb{E}[cos varphi] - sin t cdot mathbb{E}[sin varphi] end{aligned} ] Given (varphi) is uniformly distributed over ((0, 2pi)), we use its expectation values: [ mathbb{E}[cos varphi] = frac{1}{2pi} int_{0}^{2pi} cos varphi , dvarphi = 0 ] [ mathbb{E}[sin varphi] = frac{1}{2pi} int_{0}^{2pi} sin varphi , dvarphi = 0 ] Thus: [ m_x(t) = cos t cdot 0 - sin t cdot 0 = 0 ] So, the mean is: [ m_x(t) = 0 ] Step 2: Finding the Autocorrelation Function The autocorrelation function is given by: [ R_X(t_1, t_2) = mathbb{E}[X(t_1) X(t_2)] ] Substituting the given function (X(t)): [ begin{aligned} R_X(t_1, t_2) &= mathbb{E}[cos(t_1 + varphi) cos(t_2 + varphi)] &= mathbb{E}[cos(t_1 + varphi) cos(t_2 + varphi)] end{aligned} ] Using the product-to-sum identities for cosines: [ cos A cos B = frac{1}{2} [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] ] Applying this, we have: [ begin{aligned} R_X(t_1, t_2) &= frac{1}{2} mathbb{E}[cos((t_1 + varphi) + (t_2 + varphi)) + cos((t_1 + varphi) - (t_2 + varphi))] &= frac{1}{2} mathbb{E}[cos(t_1 + t_2 + 2varphi) + cos(t_1 - t_2)] end{aligned} ] Since (varphi) is uniformly distributed over ((0, 2pi)), and knowing that: [ mathbb{E}[cos(t_1 + t_2 + 2varphi)] = frac{1}{2pi} int_{0}^{2pi} cos(t_1 + t_2 + 2varphi) , dvarphi = 0 ] Thus, the autocorrelation function simplifies to: [ R_X(t_1, t_2) = frac{1}{2} cos(t_1 - t_2) ] Conclusion We have established that: 1.

Substituting into the third equation:** Using ( w_4 = w_3 + 1 ) in the third equation, we get: [ w_2 + w_3 + (w_3 + 1) = 102 ] Therefore: [ w_2 + 2w_3 + 1 = 102 ] [ w_2 + 2w_3 = 101 ] [ w_2 = 101 - 2w_3 ] **4.

Next, we need to calculate the molar mass of benzoic acid by adding up the atomic masses of all the atoms in the formula: - Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12.01 g/mol. - Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1.01 g/mol. - Oxygen (O) has an atomic mass of approximately 16.00 g/mol. Molar mass of benzoic acid = (7 × 12.01 g/mol) + (6 × 1.01 g/mol) + (2 × 16.00 g/mol) = (7 × 12.01) + (6 × 1.01) + (2 × 16.00) = 84.07 + 6.06 + 32.00 = 122.13 g/mol Now, we calculate the total mass of oxygen in one mole of benzoic acid: Mass of oxygen = 2 × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol Finally, we find the mass percentage of oxygen in benzoic acid by dividing the mass of oxygen by the molar mass of benzoic acid and multiplying by 100%: Mass percentage of O = (Mass of oxygen / Molar mass of benzoic acid) × 100% = (32.00 g/mol / 122.13 g/mol) × 100% = 0.262 × 100% = 26.2% Therefore, the mass percentage of oxygen in benzoic acid is approximately boxed{26.2%} ."},{"prompt":"What is the maximum number of acute angles a convex polygon can have?","completion":"To determine the maximum number of acute angles a convex polygon can have, follow these steps: 1. **Understanding the properties of a convex polygon**: - In a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180^circ. 2. **Define an acute angle**: - An acute angle is an angle that is less than 90^circ. 3. **Sum of interior angles**: - The sum of the interior angles of an ( n )-sided polygon is given by: text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) times 180^circ - For a convex polygon, each exterior angle is given by: text{Exterior angle} = 180^circ - text{Interior angle} 4. **Summation of exterior angles**: - The sum of exterior angles of any convex polygon is always 360^circ, regardless of the number of sides. text{Sum of exterior angles} = 360^circ 5. **Calculation and contradiction**: - Suppose a convex polygon has more than 3 acute angles.

For them all to become zero, the numbers must have been in a specific condition before the ( k )-th operation. 3. **Condition for Unchanging State**: For a number to change to zero, it must be written between two identical numbers.

The total number of photos taken on the trip is the sum of the photos taken on the first day and the second day, which is x + (x + 120). Before the trip, the family gallery had 400 photos. After the trip, the total number of photos in the gallery is 920. So, the equation representing the total number of photos after the trip is: 400 (before the trip) + x (first day) + (x + 120) (second day) = 920 Combining like terms, we get: 400 + 2x + 120 = 920 2x + 520 = 920 Subtracting 520 from both sides, we get: 2x = 920 - 520 2x = 400 Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 400 / 2 x = 200 So, they took 200 photos on the first day. The ratio of the number of photos taken on the first day to the number of photos in the family gallery before the trip is: First day photos : Gallery photos before the trip 200 : 400 This ratio can be simplified by dividing both numbers by 200: 200/200 : 400/200 1 : 2 Therefore, the ratio of the number of photos taken on the first day to the number of photos in the family gallery before the trip is boxed{1:2} ."},{"prompt":"Tom drives from town A to town B at a certain speed.

Step 1: Understand the given condition a_{1}^{2}=a_{11}^{2}. This condition implies that a_{1} and a_{11} are either equal or opposite in value. However, since d < 0, it means the sequence is decreasing, and thus a_{1} and a_{11} cannot be equal (as a_{11} would be less than a_{1}). Therefore, we conclude that a_{1} and a_{11} are opposites, i.e., a_{1} = -a_{11}. Step 2: Derive the relationship between a_{1} and a_{11}. From the formula of an arithmetic sequence, we have a_{n} = a_{1} + (n-1)d. Applying this to a_{11}, we get: [a_{11} = a_{1} + 10d] Given a_{1} = -a_{11}, substituting the expression for a_{11} yields: [a_{1} = -(a_{1} + 10d)] [a_{1} + a_{1} + 10d = 0] [2a_{1} + 10d = 0] This simplifies to: [a_{1} + 5d = 0] Therefore, a_{6} = a_{1} + 5d = 0, indicating that the 6th term of the sequence is 0.

If m = 0, the inequality becomes 1 < 0, which is clearly false and the solution set would indeed be empty. Therefore, m cannot be zero, implying m neq 0. 2. For m neq 0, in order for the inequality mx^2 - mx + 1 < 0 to have a non-empty solution set, the quadratic must have real roots, meaning the discriminant must be positive. Let's find when the discriminant of the quadratic is greater than zero: Delta = (-m)^2 - 4(m)(1) > 0 Delta = m^2 - 4m > 0 Solving the inequality for m, we find: (m-0)(m-4) > 0 The roots are m=0 and m=4. Since we have already established that m neq 0, we must consider intervals around the root m=4. 2.1. For m > 0, the discriminant must be positive, so: m^2 - 4m > 0 This inequality holds true for m > 4. 2.2. For m < 0, the quadratic mx^2 - mx + 1 opens downward (since m is negative), and since the constant term is positive (+1), the quadratic will be less than zero for some interval of x. Therefore, any m < 0 satisfies the condition. Combining the two cases, we find that the range of values for m is (-infty, 0) cup (4, +infty).

Thus, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, -frac{1}{2a}) and monotonically increasing on (-frac{1}{2a}, +∞). (2) If a = 0 and x ∈ (0, 1), we want to prove that: frac{f(x)}{e^x} + x^2 - frac{1}{x} < 1 It suffices to prove that: frac{1 - ln{x}}{e^x} + x^2 - frac{1}{x} < 1 Equivalently, we need to prove that x(1 - ln(x)) < (1 + x - x^3)e^x. Let g(x) = x(1 - ln(x)) (where x ∈ (0, 1)), then g'(x) = -ln(x). When x ∈ (0, 1), g'(x) > 0. Thus, g(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, 1). Hence, g(x) < g(1) = 1. Let h(x) = (1 + x - x^3)e^x, then h'(x) = (2 + x - 3x^2 - x^3)e^x. Let p(x) = 2 + x - 3x^2 - x^3, then p'(x) = 1 - 6x - 3x^2. When x ∈ (0, 1), p'(0) * p'(1) = -8 < 0, thus, there exists x_0 ∈ (0, 1) such that p'(x_0) = 0. Thus, the function p(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, x_0) and monotonically decreasing on (x_0, 1). When x ∈ (0, x_0), p(x_0) > p(0) = 2, and when x ∈ (x_0, 1), p(x_0) * p(1) < -4 < 0. Thus, there exists x_1 ∈ (0, 1) such that h'(x_1) = 0. Therefore, the function h(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, x_1) and monotonically decreasing on (x_1, 1). Since h(0) = 1 and h(1) = e, when x ∈ (0, 1), h(x) > h(0) = 1. Consequently, x(1 - ln(x)) < (1 + x - x^3)e^x for x ∈ (0, 1), proving that: boxed{frac{f(x)}{e^x} + x^2 - frac{1}{x} < 1, x ∈ (0, 1)}"},{"prompt":"Simplify: frac{3}{{x1}}+frac{{x3}}{{1{x^2}}}.

Notice that x^2-1 is a difference of squares, which factors into (x+1)(x-1).

The rate at which the pipe fills the tank is ( frac{1}{t} ) (tank per hour). The rate at which the leakage empties the tank is ( frac{1}{70} ) (tank per hour). When the pipe and leakage are both working, the effective rate of filling the tank is the rate of filling minus the rate of emptying: Effective rate = ( frac{1}{t} - frac{1}{70} ) Since it takes ( 7t ) hours to fill the tank with the leakage, the effective rate is also ( frac{1}{7t} ) (tank per hour).

To do this, we will use angle chasing and properties of reflections and midpoints. - Since ( D ) and ( E ) are midpoints of ( AB ) and ( AC ) respectively, ( DE ) is the midline of ( triangle ABC ), parallel to ( BC ) and half its length. 3. **Reflection Properties:** - ( F ) is the reflection of ( H ) with respect to ( DE ).

The smallest positive integer is 1, so let's choose k = 1 and m = 2 (the next smallest integer). This allows us to have r = 23 as the median.

If a red ball is drawn, the customer wins a prize; if a yellow ball is drawn, the customer does not win. Additionally, customers who do not win are allowed to return the ball they drew to the bag and add one red or yellow ball (of the same size and quality as the four balls in the bag). Then, one ball is randomly drawn from the bag, the color is noted, the ball is not returned to the bag, and another ball is drawn. If the colors of the two balls drawn are the same, the customer can receive a fine gift. It is known that a customer has been given a lottery chance.

Explain your reasoning.","completion":"# Solution: Part 1: Probability of Winning on the First Draw Given that there are 1 red ball and 3 yellow balls in the bag, the total number of outcomes for the first draw is 4 (1 red + 3 yellow). Let's denote the event of drawing a red ball on the first draw as event A. There is only 1 favorable outcome for event A (drawing the red ball).

Part 2: Optimal Color of Ball to Add for a Better Chance to Receive a Fine Gift After not winning on the first draw, the customer decides to add a ball to the bag. To determine which color ball should be added, we analyze the probabilities of drawing two balls of the same color after adding either a red or a yellow ball. - **Case 1**: Adding a red ball to the bag After adding a red ball, the bag contains 2 red balls and 3 yellow balls. Drawing two balls without replacement, the possible combinations where the colors match are 8 out of 20 total combinations. Thus, the probability of receiving a fine gift in this case is: P_1 = frac{8}{20} = frac{2}{5}. - **Case 2**: Adding a yellow ball to the bag After adding a yellow ball, the bag contains 1 red ball and 4 yellow balls. Drawing two balls without replacement, the possible combinations where the colors match are 12 out of 20 total combinations. Thus, the probability of receiving a fine gift in this case is: P_2 = frac{12}{20} = frac{3}{5}. Comparing the probabilities: P_1 = frac{2}{5} < P_2 = frac{3}{5}. Therefore, to increase the chance of receiving a fine gift, the customer should add a yellow ball to the bag, as P_1 < P_2 implies that the probability of drawing two balls of the same color is higher when a yellow ball is added.

In the region bounded by segments (AB), (AC), and the smaller arc (BC), there is a segment. Prove that its length does not exceed (AB).","completion":": 1. **Introduction:** Given a circle inscribed in an angle with vertex ( A ), touching the sides of the angle at points ( B ) and ( C ), we need to show that any segment within the region bounded by ( AB ), ( AC ), and the minor arc ( BC ) on the inscribed circle has a length not exceeding ( AB ). 2. **Homothety transformation:** If the segment does not intersect the inscribed circle, we can apply a homothety (a type of dilation transformation) centered at ( A ) with a scaling factor greater than 1. This transformation will map our segment into another segment that intersects the circle at some point ( X ) within the specified region. 3. **Drawing the tangent:** Next, we draw the tangent line ( DE ) to the circle at point ( X ), where ( D ) and ( E ) lie on the segments ( AB ) and ( AC ), respectively. Since tangents from a point to a circle are equal, we have: [ AD = AE ] 4. **Triangle ( ADE ):** By construction, we notice that ( AD ) and ( AE ) are both less than ( AB ): [ AD leq AB quad text{and} quad AE leq AB ] 5. **Inequality establishment:** Now consider the sum of the segments: [ AD + DE + AE ] Note that symmetry of the tangents implies ( DE ) must also be restricted in length. Using the triangle inequality within ( triangle ADE ), we have: [ DE < AD + AE ] Given both ( AD ) and ( AE ) are less than ( AB ), adding the two: [ AD + AE leq 2AB ] Since ( DE ) lies along the tangent between points ( D ) and ( E ) on sides ( AB ) and ( AC ), let’s denote: [ DE < frac{1}{2} (AD + DE + AE) ] Plugging earlier inequalities: [ DE < frac{1}{2}(2AB) ] Thus: [ DE < AB ] 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, any segment formed within the region bounded by ( AB ), ( AC ), and the minor arc ( BC ), potentially lying within ( triangle ADE ), ensures that its length does not exceed ( AB ). Since the bounding region is larger than any transforming segment processed under the homothety: [ text{length of any segment in the region } leq AB ] Thus, the proof is completed.

This function describes a line with a slope of -2, which means for every unit increase in x, y decreases by 2 units. This is because the slope k = -2 < 0, indicating a negative relationship between x and y. Given two points on this line, P_{1}(-2, y_{1}) and P_{2}(3, y_{2}), we can substitute the x values of these points into the equation to find the corresponding y values.

According to the problem, 15% of the oranges are rotten, which means that 85% of the oranges are in good condition. Similarly, 8% of the bananas are rotten, which means that 92% of the bananas are in good condition. The total percentage of fruits in good condition is 87.8%. This percentage includes both the oranges and the bananas. We can set up the following equation to represent the situation: (85% of O) + (92% of 400 bananas) = 87.8% of (O + 400 bananas) Let's convert the percentages to decimals for easier calculation: (0.85 * O) + (0.92 * 400) = 0.878 * (O + 400) Now, let's solve for O: (0.85 * O) + (0.92 * 400) = 0.878 * O + 0.878 * 400 0.85O + 368 = 0.878O + 350.4 Now, let's move the terms involving O to one side and the constants to the other side: 0.85O - 0.878O = 350.4 - 368 -0.028O = -17.6 Now, divide both sides by -0.028 to solve for O: O = -17.6 / -0.028 O = 628.57 Since the number of oranges must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number: O ≈ 629 Therefore, the shopkeeper bought approximately boxed{629} oranges."},{"prompt":"Let the set A={y|y=x^{frac{1}{3}}}, B={x|y=ln(x1)}.

This can be rewritten as: [ x = b^2 - y^2 = (b - y)(b + y) ] Since ( x ) is a natural number, ( (b - y)(b + y) ) must also be a natural number. 3. From the first equation ( x^2 + y = a^2 ), we have: [ y = a^2 - x^2 = (a - x)(a + x) ] Since ( x, y in mathbb{N} ), ( a > x ) which implies ( a geq x + 1 ). Therefore: [ y = (a - x)(a + x) geq (1)(2x + 1) = 2x + 1 ] Hence, ( y > x ). 4. From the second equation ( y^2 + x = b^2 ), we have: [ x = b^2 - y^2 = (b - y)(b + y) ] Since ( x, y in mathbb{N} ), ( b > y ) which implies ( b geq y + 1 ). Therefore: [ x = (b - y)(b + y) geq (1)(2y + 1) = 2y + 1 ] Hence, ( x > y ). 5. From steps 3 and 4, we have ( y > x ) and ( x > y ), which is a contradiction.

Therefore: [ 3x = 1200 + x ] Solving for ( x ): [ 3x - x = 1200 implies 2x = 1200 implies x = 600 ] Consequently: [ AG = 3x = 3 times 600 = 1800 text{ meters} ] Case 2: Order ( A, V, B, G ) - Given: [ AB = 600 text{ meters},; BV = x text{ meters},; VG = 600 text{ meters} ] - According to the problem: [ AG = AV + VG = x + 600 ] and ( AG = 3 times BV ). Therefore: [ 600 - x + x + 600 - x = 3x ] Simplifying: [ 1200 - x = 3x implies 4x = 1200 implies x = 300 text{ meters} ] Consequently: [ AG = 3x = 3 times 300 = 900 text{ meters} ] 4. **Counterexamples**: - The configurations ( V, A, G, B ) and ( V, G, A, B ) are impossible because they lead to contradictions in the given distances.

The frog can jump from ( X ) to ( Y ) if ( r_X = |XY| ). 2. **Initial jump capability:** The frog can jump to any point on the circle ( C(X_0, r_0) ), where ( r_0 = r(X_0) ). For every ( X in C(X_0, r_0) ), we have ( r(X) in [r_0/2, 3r_0/2] ).

We need to show that these diagonals intersect at a single point. 1. **Define the vertices**: Suppose the convex hexagon has vertices labeled as A, B, C, D, E, and F in a counterclockwise direction. 2. **Label the diagonals**: Consider the three diagonals that connect opposite vertices: - Diagonal AD - Diagonal BE - Diagonal CF 3. **Area relations**: Since each diagonal bisects the area of the hexagon, let: - S_{mathrm{hex}} be the total area of the hexagon. - S_{mathrm{hex}}/2 be the area of each section created by one diagonal. 4. **Expressing diagonal area properties**: For diagonal AD: [ frac{S_{mathrm{hex}}}{2} = S_{mathrm{APDEF}} + S_{mathrm{DAEF}} ] Similarly, for diagonal BE: [ frac{S_{mathrm{hex}}}{2} = S_{mathrm{BAEDF}} + S_{mathrm{FBEDC}} ] And for diagonal CF: [ frac{S_{mathrm{hex}}}{2} = S_{mathrm{CBED}} + S_{mathrm{DAFEC}} ] 5. **Introducing triangle PQR**: Assume the diagonals AD, BE, and CF intersect at point P, Q, and R respectively. 6. **Equality of smaller areas**: By relying on equal area properties, express the equalities for various combinations of the areas formed by the diagonals: [ S_{mathrm{APDE}} + S_{mathrm{EFAP}} = S_{mathrm{PDCF}} + S_{mathrm{APFB}} ] [ S_{mathrm{APDE}} + S_{mathrm{APFB}} = S_{mathrm{PDCF}} + S_{mathrm{EFAP}} ] This implies: [ S_{mathrm{APFB}} = S_{mathrm{EFAP}} ] 7. **Using equality**: Since (P) divides each area equally, we can say: [ AP cdot BP = EP cdot DP = ER cdot RQ ] Hence: [ AP cdot BP > ER cdot DQ ] This inequality tells us about the relationship between the area and side lengths. 8. **Contradiction for multiple points**: Analogously, [ CQ cdot DQ > AP cdot FR ] [ FR cdot ER > BP cdot CQ ] 9. **Concluding the proof**: By multiplying these inequalities, we get: [ AB cdot BP cdot CQ cdot DQ cdot FR cdot ER > ER cdot DQ cdot AP cdot FR cdot BP cdot CQ ] However, the equality from the initial equal area properties shows that: [ AP cdot BP cdot CQ cdot DQ cdot FR cdot ER = ER cdot DQ cdot AP cdot FR cdot BP cdot CQ ] This results in a contradiction unless all areas are strictly equal, meaning that the diagonals intersect at one unique point. # Conclusion: Since this contradiction indicates that our assumption of multiple intersection points is false, we conclude that the diagonals indeed intersect at a single unique point.

According to Bochner's theorem, a function is a characteristic function if and only if it is positive definite and ( varphi(0) = 1 ). Analyzing Each Given Function: The first step is to analyze each function provided to see if it satisfies these conditions. 1. **Function:** [ varphi(t) = exp(-|t|^alpha), quad alpha > 2 ] - When (alpha > 2), the second derivative at ( t = 0 ) is zero: [ varphi''(0) = 0, ] - which implies that ( mathbb{E}[xi^2] = 0 ).

Summary for Specific Parameters: The above steps confirm which functions cannot be characteristic in certain conditions. Next, evaluating for other functions: 1. **Function:** [ varphi(t) = exp(-|t|^alpha), quad alpha in (0, 2] ] - By Bochner's theorem and properties of characteristic functions: [ exp(-a t^2) quad text{(Gaussian characteristic function)} ] - indicates that (varphi(t)) with (alpha in (0, 2]) is indeed characteristic. 2. **Function:** [ varphi(t) = frac{1}{(1+|t|^alpha)^beta}, quad alpha in (0, 2], beta > 0 ] - It is a product of independent characteristic functions of a certain form, thus also characteristic. 3. **Function:** [ varphi(t) = (1-|t|)^beta, quad text{for} quad |t| leq 1, beta geq 1 ] - By theorem of Pol, it satisfies all required characteristics. 4. **Function:** [ varphi(t) = (1-|t|)^beta, quad text{for} quad |t| leq 1, beta in (0, 1) ] - Upon verification using bounded nature it turns out non-characteristic. 5. **Function:** [ varphi(t) = begin{cases} 1-|t|^3, & |t| leq 1 0, & |t| >1 end{cases} ] - Non-characteristic due to the lower (beta). 6. **Function:** [ varphi(t) = begin{cases} 1-|t|, & |t| leq frac{1}{2} frac{1}{4|t|}, & |t| > frac{1}{2} end{cases} ] - Not characteristic on manipulating the seams. # Conclusion: The functions that are **characteristic** are: [ boxed{(1-|t|)^{beta} cdot I(|t| leqslant 1), beta geqslant 1, quad text{and} quad (1-|t|) mathbf{1}(|t| leqslant 1 / 2) + frac{1}{4|t|} mathbf{1}(|t|> 1 / 2)} ] The functions that are **not characteristic**: [ boxed{exp(-|t|^{alpha}) : (alpha >2), frac{1}{(1+|t|^alpha)^beta} : (alpha>2), (1-|t|^beta) : ( beta in(0,1)), 1-|t|^3} ]"},{"prompt":"Mary now takes 45 minutes to walk uphill 1.5 km from her home to school, and it takes her only 15 minutes to walk back down the same distance from school to home.

This similarity arises from the fact both angle MAB + angle BAN = 180^circ and angle BPN + angle BAN = 180^circ. - Similarly, angle MBA = angle MNP. 2. **Parallel Tangents and Lines:** - Let MT_{1} be the tangent at point M to circle C_{1} and MT be the tangent at M to the circle circumscribing triangle MNP. - The angle T_{1}MA is measured by half the arc MA of C_{1} and is equal to angle MBA. - Hence, angle T_{1}MA = angle MNP. Similarly, angle TMN = angle MPN = angle MAB. From these equalities, it follows that MT_{1} parallel NP and MT parallel AB. 3. **Parallel Relationships of Centers:** - Let O_{1} and O_{2} be the centers of circles C_{1} and C_{2} respectively, and O be the center of the circle circumscribing triangle MNP. - Since MT parallel AB, the line OM is parallel to O_{1}O_{2} and perpendicular to the chord AB. - Similarly, MT_{1}parallel NP, hence O_{1}M is parallel to the perpendicular O_{2}K, which is drawn from O_{2} to the chord NP. - As the perpendicular bisector of NP passes through the center O of the circle, the quadrilateral MO_{1}O_{2}O forms a parallelogram where O_{2}O = O_{1}M. 4. **Circumcircle Relationship:** - Therefore, the locus of the centers O for different positions of M is a circle with center at O_{2} and radius equal to the radius of C_{1}. 5. **Orthocenter and Median Relationships:** - Denote the radius of C_{1} as r_{1}, and the distance OM as d (OM = O_{2}O_{1} since O_{2}O_{1}MO is a parallelogram). - The triangle QRS formed by the mid-segments of triangle MAB is similar to MAB with a similarity ratio of frac{1}{2}. - Therefore, triangle MNP is similar to QRS with a similarity ratio frac{2d}{r_{1}}. 6. **Orthocenter Calculation:** - The point O_{1} is the orthocenter of triangle QRS since perpendiculars from the mid-segments of triangle MAB are altitudes of triangle QRS. - If ML is the altitude of triangle MNP and H is its orthocenter, we have: [ frac{MH}{O_{1}Q} = frac{2d}{r_{1}},quad MH = frac{2dcdot b}{r_{1}} ] 7. **Altitude Intersection:** - Since MO_{1}parallel OK and OKperp NP, ML passes through O_{1}. - Thus, for the orthocenter O_{1}H = MH - O_{1}M = frac{2dcdot b}{r_{1}} - r_{1} = frac{2dcdot b - r_{1}^{2}}{r_{1}}. - Therefore, the locus of points H is a circle with center at O_{1} and radius frac{2dcdot b - r_{1}^{2}}{r_{1}}. 8. **Median Intersection:** - Note E lies on segment OH and divides it in the ratio frac{OE}{EH} = frac{1}{2}. - Both segments O_{1}H and O_{2}O are parallel as they are perpendicular to NP.

Now, consider the case where ( f ) is not constant. Let us denote the line through the points ( (x, f(x)) ) and ( (y, f(y)) ) as ( l_{x,y} ). The equation of this line is given by: [ frac{y^{*} - f(x)}{x^{*} - x} = frac{f(y) - f(x)}{y - x} ] where ( left(x^{*}, y^{*}right) ) represents another point on the line ( l_{x,y} ). 4.

Combine like terms: [ (a cdot x_0^2 + b cdot y_0^2)(1 - 2t + t^2) + c cdot z_0^2 (1 + 2t + t^2) ] 6.

Let's identify the possible slots where we can place the public service ads. Since P_1 and P_2 cannot be placed at the ends and cannot be consecutive, we look at the spaces between the commercial ads. With six ads, there are five spaces between them: C_1 quad C_2 quad C_3 quad C_4 quad C_5 quad C_6 These spaces are represented as below: C_1 quad _ quad C_2 quad _ quad C_3 quad _ quad C_4 quad _ quad C_5 quad _ quad C_6 To prevent the public service ads from being consecutive, we can't place them in adjacent slots. So when we pick one slot for a public service ad, the neighboring slots become unavailable. We first select a space for P_1. There are 5 spaces to choose from. Once P_1 has been placed, we cannot place P_2 in the slot immediately beside P_1. So now P_2 has three possible slots remaining.

We know that Jung-min can do 256 jumps in 4 minutes. To find out how many jumps he can do in 1 minute, we divide 256 by 4: 256 jumps / 4 minutes = 64 jumps per minute Now, to find out how many jumps Jung-min can do in 3 minutes, we multiply the number of jumps per minute by 3: 64 jumps per minute * 3 minutes = 192 jumps Now, let's find out how many times Jimin can jump rope in 3 minutes.

So, Jimin's total for 3 minutes is already given: 111 jumps in 3 minutes = 111 jumps Finally, to find the sum of the number of times they both jumped rope in 3 minutes, we add Jung-min's total to Jimin's total: Jung-min's total: 192 jumps Jimin's total: 111 jumps 192 jumps + 111 jumps = 303 jumps Therefore, the sum of the number of times Jung-min and Jimin jumped rope in 3 minutes is boxed{303} jumps."},{"prompt":"the number 100ab, a and b represent the tens and units digits, respectively, where both a and b are prime numbers. If 110ab is divisible by 55, what is the greatest possible value of b × a?","completion":"For a number to be divisible by 55, it must be divisible by both 5 and 11. First, let's consider the divisibility by 5. For a number to be divisible by 5, its units digit must be either 0 or 5. Since b is a prime number and the only single-digit prime number that is divisible by 5 is 5 itself, b must be 5. Next, let's consider the divisibility by 11. For a number to be divisible by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be either 0 or a multiple of 11. In the number 110ab, the sum of the digits in the odd positions is 1 + 0 + b = 1 + b, and the sum of the digits in the even positions is 1 + a. For the number to be divisible by 11, we need: (1 + b) - (1 + a) = 0 or a multiple of 11 Simplifying, we get: b - a = 0 or a multiple of 11 Since a and b are both single-digit prime numbers, the only way b - a can be a multiple of 11 is if b = a. However, since a and b are distinct digits, this cannot be the case. Therefore, we must have: b - a = 0 But since b is already determined to be 5, we need to find the greatest prime number a that is less than 5, which would be 3. So, a = 3 and b = 5.

We need to find the number of convex ( m )-gons whose vertices are in ( P ) and exactly two of whose internal angles are acute. 2. **Proving a Lemma:** First, we prove a lemma: a convex ( m )-gon whose vertices lie in ( P ) can have at most two acute angles, and if it does have two acute angles, they must be adjacent. 3. **Analyzing an ( m )-gon:** Suppose such a convex ( m )-gon is given as ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_m ). Consider the situation where at least one of the internal angles, say ( angle P_m P_1 P_2 ), is acute: [ angle P_m P_1 P_2 < frac{pi}{2} ] This implies: [ angle P_2 P_j P_m = pi - angle P_2 P_1 P_m > frac{pi}{2} quad text{(for } 3 leq j leq m-1text{)} ] Moreover, we have: [ angle P_{j-1} P_j P_{j+1} > frac{pi}{2} quad text{(for } 3 leq j leq m-1text{)} ] so: [ angle P_1 P_2 P_3 + angle P_{m-1} P_m P_1 > pi ] Thus, at most two internal angles can be acute, and these two acute angles must be adjacent. 4. **Application of the Lemma:** From the lemma, if a convex ( m )-gon in ( P ) has exactly two acute internal angles, they must be adjacent.

Substituting x = a into the tangent equation: [ frac{x_0 a}{a^2} + frac{y_0 Q_y}{b^2} = 1 implies frac{a x_0}{a^2} + frac{y_0 Q_y}{b^2} = 1 implies frac{x_0}{a} + frac{y_0 Q_y}{b^2} = 1 ] Solving for Q_y: [ frac{y_0 Q_y}{b^2} = 1 - frac{x_0}{a} implies Q_y = frac{b^2}{y_0} left(1 - frac{x_0}{a}right) = frac{b^2}{y_0 a} (a - x_0) ] Hence, the coordinates of Q are: [ Q(a, frac{b^2 (a - x_0)}{a y_0}) ] 5. **Slope of Line (OQ):** The slope m of the line OQ (from origin to Q) is: [ m_{OQ} = frac{Q_y}{Q_x} = frac{frac{b^2 (a - x_0)}{a y_0}}{a} = frac{b^2}{a^2} cdot frac{a - x_0}{y_0} ] 6. **Point (B) Coordinates:** The coordinates of vertex B are (-a, 0). 7. **Slope of Line (BP):** The slope m' of line BP from B(-a, 0) to P(x_0, y_0) is: [ m_{BP} = frac{y_0 - 0}{x_0 - (-a)} = frac{y_0}{a + x_0} ] 8. **Parallel Lines Condition:** For BP parallel OQ, the slopes must be equal, thus: [ m_{OQ} = m_{BP} implies frac{b^2}{a^2} cdot frac{a - x_0}{y_0} = frac{y_0}{a + x_0} ] Cross-multiplying: [ frac{b^2 (a - x_0)}{a^2} = frac{y_0^2}{a + x_0} ] [ b^2 (a - x_0) (a + x_0) = a^2 y_0^2 ] [ b^2 (a^2 - x_0^2) = a^2 y_0^2 ] Dividing both sides by a^2 b^2: [ frac{a^2 - x_0^2}{a^2} = frac{y_0^2}{b^2} ] [ frac{x_0^2}{a^2} + frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1 ] 9. **Conclusion:** The equation frac{x_0^2}{a^2} + frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1 indeed holds because P lies on the ellipse.

The angle relationship ensures: [ angle ABP' = angle AOQ' implies BP' parallel OQ' ] 3. **Maintain Parallelism in Affine Transformation:** When transforming back to the ellipse, the tangents and their intersections translate back correspondingly.

For any real number a, determine whether the circle with diameter PM always passes through point F, and explain the reason.","completion":"Solution: (Ⅰ) Proof: Method 1: From x^2 = 4y, we get y= frac {1}{4}x^{2}, so y'= frac {1}{2}x. Thus, the slope of line PA is frac {1}{2}x_{1}. Since points A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2) are on parabola C, we have y_{1}= frac {1}{4} x_{ 1 }^{ 2 } and y_{2}= frac {1}{4} x_{ 2 }^{ 2 }. Therefore, the equation of line PA is y- frac {1}{4} x_{ 1 }^{ 2 }= frac {1}{2}x_{1}(x-x_{1}). Since point P(a, -2) lies on line PA, we have -2- frac {1}{4} x_{ 1 }^{ 2 }= frac {1}{2}x_{1}(a-x_{1}), which simplifies to x_{ 1 }^{ 2 }-2ax_{1}-8=0. Similarly, x_{ 2 }^{ 2 }-2ax_{2}-8=0. Thus, x_1 and x_2 are the roots of the equation x^2 - 2ax - 8 = 0. Therefore, x_1x_2 = -8. Also, y_{1}y_{2}= frac {1}{4} x_{ 1 }^{ 2 } cdot frac {1}{4} x_{ 2 }^{ 2 }= frac {1}{16}(x_{1}x_{2})^{2}=4, so x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = -4 is a constant value. Method 2: Assume the equation of the tangent line passing through P(a, -2) and tangent to parabola C is y+2=k(x-a), begin{cases} y+2=k(x-a) x^{2}=4y end{cases}, eliminating y gives x^2 - 4kx + 4ka + 8 = 0, from Delta = 16k^2 - 4(4ak + 8) = 0, simplifying gives k^2 - ak - 2 = 0. Thus, k_1k_2 = -2. From x^2 = 4y, we get y= frac {1}{4}x^{2}, so y'= frac {1}{2}x. Thus, the slopes of lines PA and PB are k_{1}= frac {1}{2}x_{1} and k_{2}= frac {1}{2}x_{2} respectively. Therefore, frac {1}{4}x_{1}x_{2}=-2, which means x_1x_2 = -8. Also, y_{1}y_{2}= frac {1}{4} x_{ 1 }^{ 2 } cdot frac {1}{4} x_{ 2 }^{ 2 }= frac {1}{16}(x_{1}x_{2})^{2}=4, so x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = -4 is a constant value. (Ⅱ) Method 1: The equation of the perpendicular bisector of line PA is y- frac {y_{1}-2}{2}=- frac {2}{x_{1}}(x- frac {x_{1}+a}{2}), since y_{1}= frac {1}{4} x_{ 1 }^{ 2 } and x_{ 1 }^{ 2 }-8=2ax_{1}, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of line PA becomes y- frac {ax_{1}}{4}=- frac {2}{x_{1}}(x- frac {x_{1}+a}{2}). Similarly, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of line PB is y- frac {ax_{2}}{4}=- frac {2}{x_{2}}(x- frac {x_{2}+a}{2}). Solving these gives x= frac {3}{2}a and y=1+ frac {a^{2}}{2}, thus point M( frac {3}{2}a, 1+ frac {a^{2}}{2}). The focus of parabola C is F(0, 1), then overrightarrow {MF}=(- frac {3}{2}a, - frac {a^{2}}{2}), overrightarrow {PF}=(-a, 3). Since overrightarrow {MF} cdot overrightarrow {PF} = frac {3a^{2}}{2} - frac {3a^{2}}{2} = 0, overrightarrow {MF} perp overrightarrow {PF}. Therefore, the circle with diameter PM always passes through point F. Another method: The equation of the circle with diameter PM is (x-a)(x- frac {3}{2}a)+(y+2)(y-1- frac {a^{2}}{2})=0. Substituting point F(0, 1) into the equation shows that point F's coordinates satisfy the equation. Therefore, the circle with diameter PM always passes through point F. Method 2: Let the coordinates of point M be (m, n), then the equation of the circumcircle of triangle PAB is (x-m)^2+(y-n)^2=(m-a)^2+(n+2)^2. Since points A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2) lie on this circle, (x_1-m)^2+(y_1-n)^2=(m-a)^2+(n+2)^2 and (x_2-m)^2+(y_2-n)^2=(m-a)^2+(n+2)^2. Subtracting these equations gives (x_1-x_2)(x_1+x_2-2m)+(y_1-y_2)(y_1+y_2-2n)=0, from (Ⅰ) we know x_1+x_2=2a, x_1x_2=-8, y_1= frac {1}{4} x_{ 1 }^{ 2 }, y_2= frac {1}{4} x_{ 2 }^{ 2 }, substituting these into the equation gives (x_1-x_2)(4a-4m+a^3+4a-2an)=0, when x_1 neq x_2, we get 8a-4m+a^3-2an=0, assuming the circle with diameter PM always passes through point F, then overrightarrow {MF} perp overrightarrow {PF}, which gives ma-3(n-1)=0, solving these gives m= frac {3}{2}a, n=1+ frac {1}{2}a^{2}, thus point M( frac {3}{2}a, 1+ frac {1}{2}a^{2}). When x_1 = x_2, then a=0, point M(0, 1).
