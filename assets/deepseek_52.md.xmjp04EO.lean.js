These four lines form a rectangle with a length and width not exceeding (2a), where (a) is the side length of one square. If any dimension of this rectangle were greater than (2a), the squares flanking the boundary would not intersect, which contradicts the problem statement.

Prove that for smaller ( n ), this cannot be done with every convex 100gon.","completion":"1. **Observation and Initial Assumptions:** We need to find the smallest number n such that any convex 100-gon can be represented as an intersection of n triangles. We will start by considering how many triangles are sufficient to form a 100-gon, and then determine that less than this number cannot cover all convex 100-gons. 2. **Sufficiency Argument:** We assert that 50 triangles are sufficient to cover any convex 100-gon. - Suppose Delta_k-triangles are formed with vertices A_k, A_{k-1}, and A_{k+1}. Here, A_k is a vertex of the convex 100-gon, and the sides of the Delta_k-triangle lie along the rays joining A_k with A_{k-1} and A_{k+1}. - By considering alternating vertices in the 100-gon, specifically the triangles Delta_2, Delta_4, ldots, Delta_{100}, we can cover the entire convex 100-gon. Therefore, 50 triangles suffice to cover any convex 100-gon. 3. **Restrictive Argument for Fewer Triangles:** - We now need to show that fewer than 50 triangles are not sufficient for some convex 100-gons. - Consider the given example in the solution. If three sides of any polygon are to coincide with the sides of one triangle, then due to the convex nature of the polygon, it is inevitable that one of these sides will be an actual side of the original 100-gon.

This is because the direction vector of ( M_1M_2 ) will be the same regardless of the positions of ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) on their respective lines. Therefore, all lines ( M_1M_2 ) will pass through a common point at infinity, implying they are parallel. 2. **Case 2: Intersecting Lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 )** Let ( P ) be the intersection point of ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ).

For Problem (2): Given that the point representing a is between -4 and 2, we have -4 < a < 2. This implies two conditions: 1. a + 4 > 0 because adding 4 to any a greater than -4 will result in a positive number. 2. a - 2 < 0 because subtracting 2 from any a less than 2 will result in a negative number. Therefore, the expression |a+4|+|a-2| simplifies to a+4+2-a because |a+4| becomes a+4 due to its positivity and |a-2| becomes -(a-2) due to its negativity, which further simplifies to 2.

His mother thinks Arun's weight cannot be greater than 68 kg. Combining all three estimations, we can conclude that Arun's weight is greater than 65 kg (from Arun's estimation), less than 70 kg (from his brother's estimation), and also less than 68 kg (from his mother's estimation). Since the mother's estimation sets the upper limit at 68 kg, which is lower than the brother's upper limit of 70 kg, we must consider the mother's estimation for the upper limit. Therefore, the range of Arun's weight is greater than 65 kg and less than 68 kg. Now, we know the average of different probable weights of Arun is 67 kg. Since the average is 67 kg, and the upper limit is 68 kg, the lower limit must be such that the average falls in the middle of the range. The range, in this case, is from the lower limit to 68 kg.

The triangles ( triangle A O_1 B ), ( triangle B O_2 O_1 ), ( triangle B O C ), ( triangle C O_2 D ) are all equilateral, seeing ( AB = BC = CD ). The area of an equilateral triangle with side length ( R ) is: [ S_{triangle} = frac{R^2 sqrt{3}}{4} ] 3. **Total Area Calculation:** Given the quadrilateral consists of 5 similar triangles, where each is: [ S_{triangle B O C} = frac{R^2 sqrt{3}}{4} ] Summing the area of these 5 triangles: [ S_{O_1ADO_2} = 5 times S_{triangle A O_1 B} = 5 times frac{R^2 sqrt{3}}{4} ] Calculating further: [ S_{O_1ADO_2} = frac{5 R^2 sqrt{3}}{4} ] # Conclusion: Thus, the area of the quadrilateral ( O_1ADO_2 ) is: [ boxed{frac{5R^2 sqrt{3}}{4}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the ellipse C has its axes of symmetry as the coordinate axes, its focus is on the xaxis, its eccentricity is frac {1}{2}, and it passes through the point (1, frac {3}{2}).

Since the eccentricity is frac {1}{2}, we have frac {c}{a}= frac {1}{2}, which implies a=2c. Thus, b^{2}=a^{2}-c^{2}=3c^{2}. Since the ellipse passes through the point (1, frac {3}{2}), we have frac {1}{4c^{2}}+ frac { frac {9}{4}}{3c^{2}}=1. Solving for c^2, we get c^{2}=1. Thus, a^{2}=4 and b^{2}=3.

According to Vieta's theorem, x_1 + x_2 = frac {16k}{4k^{2}+3} and x_1x_2 = frac {4}{4k^{2}+3}. Since the origin O is outside the circle with MN as its diameter, angle MON is acute. Given that overrightarrow {OM}= frac {1}{3} overrightarrow {OA} and overrightarrow {ON}= frac {2}{3} overrightarrow {OB}, angle AOB is also acute. Therefore, overrightarrow {OA}cdot overrightarrow {OB}>0. Now, overrightarrow {OA}cdot overrightarrow {OB} = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = x_1x_2 + (kx_1-2)(kx_2-2) = (k^{2}+1)x_1x_2 - 2k(x_1+x_2) + 4 = (k^{2}+1)times frac {4}{4k^{2}+3} - 2ktimes frac {16k}{4k^{2}+3} + 4 = frac {-12k^{2}+16}{4k^{2}+3}.

Start with the given equation: cos(frac{π}{3}+α)=frac{1}{3}. 2. We need to find cos(frac{π}{6}-α). We can use a trigonometric identity to relate it to a sine function: [cos(frac{π}{6}-α) = sinleft[frac{π}{2}-(frac{π}{6}-α)right] = sin(frac{π}{3}+α).] 3.

However, considering the range of frac{π}{3}+α from our previous step, frac{π}{3}+α falls into the range where sine is negative (i.e., in the third or fourth quadrant). 5.

Let us denote the number of boxes of each type by (x), (y), and (z) respectively. - The total number of shells can be expressed as: [ N = 15x + 18y + 20z ] where (x), (y), and (z) are non-negative integers. 2. **Modulo Considerations**: - Since 15, 18, and 20 share a common factor of 5, a shell count not divisible by 5 is immediately invalid. - Therefore, when calculating (N mod 5): [ 15 equiv 0 pmod{5}, quad 18 equiv 3 pmod{5}, quad 20 equiv 0 pmod{5} ] Thus, [ 15x + 18y + 20z equiv 0 + 3y + 0 equiv 3y pmod{5} ] - For (N) to be valid, (N mod 5) must be 0. 3. **Analysis of Valid Combinations**: - We analyze if N cannot be achieved for certain values (N). - If (N = 5k), shell count must be a multiple of 5. - Next, let's test lower values as potential problematic shell counts using the allowed combinations. 4. **Finding the Frobenius Number**: - The Frobenius number (largest non-representable value) for two coprime numbers (a) and (b) is given by (ab - a - b), but since we have three numbers, this concept does not directly apply. - Let's test individual values to get the highest systematic failure. 5. **Verification by Counting Shells:** - Consider largest (N) which is coprime and counts from lower total. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 - Attempt to split until exhaustion not possible: - Any value found valid by trial in lower range: [ cdots rightarrow 97 (test value) ] - Thus non-expressible until baseline unit formed. 6. **Confirm the largest un-representable using constraints least divisible factor:** - Combine best practices and keep 15, 18: [ verifying absolute multiples until half-core ] # Conclusion: It turns out the largest number un-possible to express uniformly using combinations appears sharply consistent at (97 ) for upper limit ( > 5cdots) lowest dependable remaining.

When the man walks at 5 kmph and misses the train by 7 minutes, we can write the time taken to reach the station as ( frac{D}{5} ) hours.

The difference in time between walking at 5 kmph and 6 kmph is 7 minutes (missed train) + 5 minutes (early) = 12 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this difference is ( frac{12}{60} ) hours, which simplifies to ( frac{1}{5} ) hours.

Now, recompute the product to ensure the correction: 20 cdot 27 cdot 25 = 13500, which is incorrect; thus, initial assignment is flawed.

Assuming that you fill up 4 minivans and 2 trucks, the total cost is 396, if a minivan's tank is 65 liters and a truck's tank is 120% bigger and they are all empty. What is the cost per liter of fuel?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total service cost for the vehicles. There are 4 mini-vans and 2 trucks, so the total number of vehicles is 4 + 2 = 6. The service cost per vehicle is 2.30, so the total service cost for all vehicles is 6 * 2.30 = 13.80. Now, let's find out the total fuel capacity for all the vehicles. A mini-van's tank is 65 liters. A truck's tank is 120% bigger than a mini-van's tank, so we calculate the truck's tank size as follows: 120% of 65 liters = 1.2 * 65 = 78 liters. So, a truck's tank is 65 liters + 78 liters = 143 liters. Now we calculate the total fuel capacity for all the mini-vans and trucks: Total fuel for mini-vans = 4 mini-vans * 65 liters/mini-van = 260 liters. Total fuel for trucks = 2 trucks * 143 liters/truck = 286 liters. Total fuel for all vehicles = 260 liters + 286 liters = 546 liters. Now we know the total cost for the service and the total fuel capacity. The total cost given is 396, which includes both the service cost and the fuel cost. To find the fuel cost, we subtract the service cost from the total cost: Total fuel cost = Total cost - Total service cost Total fuel cost = 396 - 13.80 Total fuel cost = 382.20 Now we have the total fuel cost and the total fuel capacity. To find the cost per liter of fuel, we divide the total fuel cost by the total fuel capacity: Cost per liter of fuel = Total fuel cost / Total fuel capacity Cost per liter of fuel = 382.20 / 546 liters Cost per liter of fuel ≈ 0.70 Therefore, the cost per liter of fuel is approximately boxed{0.70} ."},{"prompt":"an isosceles triangle ABC with AB = AC and angle A = 30^o , points L and M lie on the sides AB and AC , respectively such that AL = CM .

This means that the total value of the remaining checks is equal to the number of remaining checks times 100. The remaining checks would be the initial total number of checks (30) minus the 24 50 checks spent, so there would be 30 - 24 = 6 checks left. Since the average value of these remaining checks is 100, the total value of these 6 checks is 6 * 100 = 600. Now, we know that the remaining checks are worth 600, and these are made up of the remaining 50 checks and all the 100 checks. Since the average value of the remaining checks is 100, this means that all the remaining checks must be 100 checks. Therefore, the remaining 6 checks are all 100 checks. This means that the tourist initially had 24 50 checks (since he spent all of his 50 checks) and 6 100 checks (the remaining checks). The total worth of the traveler's checks is the sum of the worth of the 50 checks and the 100 checks: Total worth = (24 * 50) + (6 * 100) Total worth = 1200 + 600 Total worth = 1800 So, the total worth of the traveler's checks is boxed{1800} ."},{"prompt":"The average monthly salary of some employees in an organisation is Rs. 1500.

Below is the detailed reasoning and steps towards the solution. 1. **Boundary Condition Analysis**: - The boundary of the domain operatorname{Im} z > 0 is the real axis, operatorname{Im} z = 0. - We require the image of the real axis, via the transformation, to lie on the real axis in the w-plane. 2. **Imposing Real Values**: - For real values of z, i.e., z = x, the resulting value of w must also be real. Since ( z = x ) is real, substitute this into the transformation equation: [ w = frac{a x + b}{c x + d} ] For ( w ) to be real, we need to ensure all components are real for real z. Thus, ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) must be real to ensure that both the numerator and the denominator remain real, making ( w ) real. 3. **Imaginary Part of ( w )**: - For any ( z = x + i y ) where ( y > 0 ), ( w = u + i v ) should have ( v > 0 ). - Substitute ( z = x + i y ) into the function to separate real and imaginary parts. 4. **Expression for ( w )**: [ w = frac{a (x + i y) + b}{c (x + i y) + d} = frac{a x + a (i y) + b}{c x + c (i y) + d} ] Separate the real and imaginary parts: [ w = frac{(a x + b) + i (a y)}{(c x + d) + i (c y)} times frac{(c x + d) - i (c y)}{(c x + d) - i (c y)} ] Simplify by merging fractions: [ w = frac{(a x + b + i a y)(c x + d - i c y)}{(c x + d)^{2} + (c y)^{2}} ] Resulting in: [ w = frac{(a x + b)(c x + d) + a y c y + i (a y (c x + d) - c y (a x + b))}{(c x + d)^{2} + (c y)^{2}} ] 5. **Extract Imaginary Part of ( w )**: - Focus on the imaginary part: [ v = frac{a y (c x + d) - c y (a x + b)}{(c x + d)^{2} + (c y)^{2}} ] Simplify further: [ v = frac{y (a d - b c)}{(c x + d)^{2} + (c y)^{2}} ] 6. **Condition for Positive Imaginary Part**: - The denominator ((c x + d)^{2} + (c y)^{2}) is always positive. - For ( v > 0 ), it is sufficient for the numerator (y (a d - b c)) to be positive. - Since ( y > 0 ), we need ( a d - b c > 0 ). # Conclusion: The fractional-linear function ( w = frac{a z + b}{c z + d} ) maps the upper half-plane ( operatorname{Im} z > 0 ) to the upper half-plane ( operatorname{Im} w > 0 ) if and only if the condition ( a d - b c > 0 ) is satisfied.

To find out how many kilograms of paint are needed to cover 600 sq. ft., we divide the total area by the coverage of 1 kg of paint: Paint required = total surface area / coverage per kg = 600 sq. ft. / 20 sq. ft. per kg = 30 kg The cost of the paint is Rs. 40.00 per kg, so the total cost to paint the cube will be: Total cost = paint required x cost per kg = 30 kg x Rs. 40.00/kg = Rs. 1200.00 Therefore, it will cost Rs. boxed{1200.00} to paint the outside of the cube."},{"prompt":"A rectangle with dimensions 9 cm by 12 cm is inscribed in a circle.

Given that p is an odd prime (p > 2), at least one of x or y must also be an odd number, and the other must be even because the sum of two even numbers or two odd numbers cannot be odd, which p^n is. 4. Without loss of generality, consider the case where x is odd and y is even. Let us analyze the midpoint (frac{x}{2}, frac{y}{2}) of OA and consider the horizontal line through this midpoint, denoted as MN: 5. Since y is even, the y-coordinates of M and N are integers. 6. The x-coordinates of M and N are given by frac{x pm p^n}{2}. Given that x is odd and p^n is also odd, the sum and difference will both be even, hence frac{x pm p^n}{2} would be integers. 7.

According to the problem, on each move, three checkers are added to any three cells that form the corner of an L-shape (or rotated versions thereof). 3. Suppose after a certain number of moves, each cell contains ( n ) checkers. Therefore, the total number of checkers on the board would be ( 9n ). 4. At each step, we add 3 checkers. Hence, after ( k ) moves, a total of ( 3k ) checkers would be added. 5. Given that we want ( 9n ) checkers eventually, the total number of moves required would be ( k = 3n ). Therefore, the condition ( 9n = 3k ) must hold, giving ( k = 3n ). 6. Now, consider that each corner cell (four corners at top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right positions) should individually get checkers in separate moves as no L-shape can have two corners. Consequently, each corner has been selected ( n ) times in different moves. 7. Since there are 4 corners and each needs to have ( n ) checkers placed individually, the minimum moves required to place ( n ) checkers in each corner would be ( 4n ). 8. This creates a contradiction: - From steps 1-5, we established that ( 3n ) moves were needed to achieve ( 9n ) checkers. - But from step 7, each corner independently needing ( n ) placements implies at least ( 4n ) moves. - Since ( 3n < 4n ), it contradicts the assumption that every cell would have ( n ) checkers after ( 3n ) moves.

For y, similarly, we multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt{2}+1: [y=frac{1}{sqrt{2}-1}] [y=frac{sqrt{2}+1}{(sqrt{2}+1)(sqrt{2}-1)}] [y=frac{sqrt{2}+1}{2-1}] [y=sqrt{2}+1] Now, let's find the value of x^{2}-3xy+y^{2}: [x^{2}-3xy+y^{2} = (sqrt{2}-1)^{2}-3(sqrt{2}-1)(sqrt{2}+1)+(sqrt{2}+1)^{2}] [= (sqrt{2}-1)^{2}-(sqrt{2}^2-1^2)+(sqrt{2}+1)^{2}] [= (2-2sqrt{2}+1)-(2-1)+(2+2sqrt{2}+1)] [= 4-3] [= 1] However, it seems there was a mistake in the original solution's simplification process. Let's correct it by following the steps closely: Given the corrected simplification: [x^{2}-3xy+y^{2} = (sqrt{2}-1-sqrt{2}-1)^{2}-(sqrt{2}-1)(sqrt{2}+1)] [= (-2)^{2}-(2-1)] [= 4-1] [= 3] Therefore, the correct final answer is boxed{3}."},{"prompt":"2005 natural numbers are arranged in a circle. Prove that there exist two adjacent numbers such that after their removal, the remaining numbers cannot be divided into two groups with equal sums.","completion":"To prove the assertion, let's proceed by contradiction. Assume that for any pair of adjacent numbers removed, the remaining numbers can always be split into two groups with equal sums. Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Initial Approach with Even Numbers:** - Suppose all 2005 natural numbers placed in a circle are even. - Divide all numbers by 2. - Note that the property of being able to split remaining numbers into two groups with equal sums persists after this division. Thus: - Keep dividing by 2 until at least one number becomes odd. - This shows that within these 2005 numbers, there must be at least one odd number. 2. **Splitting Strategy and Parity Check:** - Restate the problem for the cases where the sum of all numbers is either even or odd. 3. **Case 1: Sum of all numbers (S) is even:** - Since 2005 is an odd number, the sum ( S ) cannot be even if all numbers are odd, because any odd number of odd numbers sum up to an odd number. - Hence, there are both odd and even numbers. - Identify an adjacent pair comprising one odd and one even number. - Remove this pair. - The sum of the remaining numbers would then be odd. - This contradicts our assumption that the remaining numbers can be split into two groups with equal sums (each group would then inherently have to sum up to an integer, but since the sum is odd, it's impossible). - Thus, there cannot be such a pair of numbers. 4. **Case 2: Sum of all numbers (S) is odd:** - There must be an adjacent pair of numbers with the same parity, either both even or both odd. - Removing this adjacent pair leaves 2003 numbers. - The sum of the remaining numbers would still be odd (since ( S - 2k_e ) where ( k_e ) is even makes ( S ) odd). - This again contradicts the initial assumption that the remaining numbers can be split into two groups with equal sums. 5. **Conclusion:** - The contradiction in both cases means our assumption is incorrect. - Hence, there must exist an adjacent pair of numbers such that when removed, the remaining numbers cannot be split into two groups with equal sums, as proven by contradiction. Thus, we have established the claim according to the contradiction principle.

Use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the equation of the tangent line at the point left(frac{1}{2}, fleft(frac{1}{2}right)right): - The point-slope form is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line. - Substituting m = 4 - 4ln 2, x_1 = frac{1}{2}, and y_1 = -2ln 2, we get: y + 2ln 2 = (4 - 4ln 2)left(x - frac{1}{2}right). 4.

Since line L passes through the point A(4,1), we have: frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b} = 1. Let's multiply both sides of the equation by ab to clear denominators: 4b + a = ab. Now let's analyze a + b: begin{align*} a + b &= (a + b)left(frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b}right) &= frac{4(a + b)}{a} + frac{(a + b)}{b} &= 4frac{b}{a} + frac{a}{b} + 4 + 1 &= 4frac{b}{a} + frac{a}{b} + 5. end{align*} By the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality), for positive numbers we have: sqrt{xy} leq frac{x + y}{2}, which means that for the two positive terms 4frac{b}{a} and frac{a}{b}, we can apply the AM-GM inequality as follows: frac{4frac{b}{a} + frac{a}{b}}{2} geq sqrt{4frac{b}{a}cdot frac{a}{b}}.

The equality holds if and only if: 4frac{b}{a} = frac{a}{b}. This implies 4b^2 = a^2. Solving for a in terms of b, we get a = 2b. Substituting back into our original equation 4b + a = ab, we find that: 4b + 2b = 2b cdot b, 6b = 2b^2, b = 3. And consequently, a = 2b = 6.

Notation: Let: - M be an arbitrary point on the figure. - M_1 be the point symmetric to M with respect to the axis of symmetry. - M_2 be the point symmetric to M with respect to the center of symmetry. 3. Analyzing Symmetry: - Since M is symmetric to M_1 with respect to the axis, the line segment overline{MM_1} is bisected perpendicularly by this axis. - Since M is symmetric to M_2 with respect to the center, the center lies at the midpoint of the line segment overline{MM_2}. 4. Constructing another axis of symmetry: We need to show that M_2 is symmetric to M with respect to another axis, specifically an axis: - Perpendicular to the first axis, - Passing through the center of symmetry. 5. Consider properties of symmetric points: - The coordinates of M_1 and M_2 in relation to M and the symmetry properties. - Place the figure in a coordinate system where: - The center of symmetry O is at the origin (0,0). - The initial axis of symmetry is the y-axis. 6. Coordinate Relationships: - Suppose M has coordinates (x, y). - Then M_1 will have coordinates (-x, y) (reflection across the y-axis). - M_2 will have coordinates (-x, -y) (reflection across the origin). 7. Verifying new symmetry: - Check if M_2 is symmetric to M with respect to the x-axis (perpendicular to the y-axis): - Reflecting (x, y) across the x-axis would give (x, -y), - Reflecting (x, -y) across the origin (which is also a reflection across both axes) gives (-x, -y) which matches M_2. 8. Conclusion: - The figure indeed has another axis of symmetry: - Perpendicular to the original axis (y-axis), - Passing through the center of symmetry (origin).

In both cases, let's look at the coloring of C and E: - For C: It touches B which in case 1 is yellow, so it must be green. In case 2, B is green, so C must be yellow. - For E: It touches D which in case 1 is green, so it must be yellow. In case 2, D is yellow, so E must be green. Conclusion: Thus, whether the top and third hexagon (B and D) are yellow-green or green-yellow, the rest (C, E) have a fixed opposite coloring to their adjacent hexagons. The exact coloring of the rest is determined once B and D are set.

Since the loan was for 46,000 and she will pay back 36,000 through her monthly payments, the difference must be the down payment she made. So, the down payment is 46,000 - 36,000 = 10,000.

Let's prove this theorem step by step: 1. **Base Case:** - For ( r leq 1 ), the theorem is trivially true because ( K_1 ) (a single vertex) or ( overline{K_1} ) (an empty graph) is always present in any graph with at least one vertex. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume ( r geq 2 ). We need to find ( n ) such that any graph with at least ( n ) vertices contains either ( K_r ) or ( overline{K_r} ). - Set ( n := 2^{2r-3} ), and let ( G ) be a graph with at least ( n ) vertices.

Consider ( (p_1, ldots, p_{2010}) = (e_i, 0, ldots, 0) ) and ( (q_1, ldots, q_{2010}) = (e_1, ldots, e_{i-1}, 0, ldots, 0) ). This construction works as required.

The base case ( k = 1 ) is obvious since we are given a nonzero multiple of ( [1, 0, ldots, 0] ) for ( k = 1 ). For the inductive step, construct the set ( S ) of all products ( [p_1, ldots, p_{2010}] [q_1, ldots, q_{2010}] ) generated by the lemma as ( (e_1, ldots, e_{2010}) ) varies. We know the value of every polynomial in ( S ) since it is the product of lower-degree polynomials whose values we know by hypothesis. 8. **Basis of Symmetric Homogeneous Polynomials:** The polynomials in ( S ) and ( [k, 0, ldots, 0] ) form a basis of the vector space of symmetric homogeneous degree-( k ) polynomials in ( x_1, ldots, x_{2010} ). We need to show that the coefficient of ( [k, 0, ldots, 0] ) in the representation of ( sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} (x_i + x_j)^k ) is nonzero. 9. **Coefficient Analysis:** We write: [ sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} (x_i + x_j)^k = 2009 sum_{i=1}^{2010} x_i^k + sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} sum_{a=1}^{k-1} binom{k}{a} x_i^a x_j^{k-a} ] and: [ frac{1}{2} sum_{a=1}^{k-1} binom{k}{a} (x_1^a + cdots + x_{2010}^a)(x_1^{k-a} + cdots + x_{2010}^{k-a}) = frac{1}{2} sum_{a=1}^{k-1} binom{k}{a} left( sum_{i=1}^{2010} x_i^k + sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} (x_i^a x_j^{k-a} + x_i^{k-a} x_j^a) right) ] Since the blue parts are the same, it follows that if ( sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} (x_i + x_j)^k ) can be expressed as a linear combination of the above polynomials with the ( x_1^k + cdots + x_{2010}^k ) coefficient zero, then we must have: [ 2009 = frac{1}{2} sum_{a=1}^{k-1} binom{k}{a} = frac{1}{2} (2^k - 2) = 2^{k-1} - 1 ] but this is never true. 10. **Conclusion:** Since we know the values of ( sum_{1 leq i < j leq 2010} (x_i + x_j)^k ) and all the polynomials in ( S ), we can find the value of ( [k, 0, ldots, 0] ). Then, since ( S ) and ( [k, 0, ldots, 0] ) form a basis for symmetric homogeneous degree-( k ) polynomials in ( x_1, ldots, x_{2010} ), we can find the value of every ( [i_1, ldots, i_{2010}] ) where ( i_1 + cdots + i_{2010} = k ), completing the inductive hypothesis. (blacksquare) 11. **Final Step:** By our key claim, we can find the ( k )-th elementary symmetric sum of the ( x_i ) for ( 1 leq k leq 2010 ), which we can use to write down a unique monic degree-( 2010 ) polynomial whose roots are precisely ( x_1, ldots, x_{2010} ).

The scenarios to consider are: a. Cases where all five digits are the same, which can happen in 3 ways (all 1s, all 2s, or all 3s). b. Cases where only two distinct digits appear.

For each of these pairs, there are 2^5 = 32 combinations, considering that we have two choices (the two selected digits) for each position in the five-digit number.

Without loss of generality, let (a > b > c). - Analyze the circles: - Circle ((AXY)) does not contain (B) or (C), so it is not a separator. - Circle ((BXY)) contains (A) but not (C), so it is a separator. - Circle ((CXY)) contains both (A) and (B), so it is not a separator. - Thus, there is exactly one separator passing through (X) and (Y). 4. **Case 2: Two Points on One Side, One Point on the Other Side of Line (XY)**: - Assume (A) and (B) lie on one side of (XY) and (C) lies on the other side. - Without loss of generality, let (a > b). - Analyze the sub-cases: - **Sub-case 1**: (180^circ - c > a > b) - Circle ((AXY)) does not contain (B) or (C), so it is not a separator. - Circle ((BXY)) contains (A) but not (C), so it is a separator. - Circle ((CXY)) does not contain (A) or (B), so it is not a separator. - Thus, exactly one separator passes through (X) and (Y). - **Sub-case 2**: (a > 180^circ - c > b) - Circle ((AXY)) contains (C) but not (B), so it is a separator. - Circle ((BXY)) contains (A) but not (C), so it is a separator. - Circle ((CXY)) contains (A) but not (B), so it is a separator. - Thus, exactly three separators pass through (X) and (Y). - **Sub-case 3**: (a > b > 180^circ - c) - Circle ((AXY)) contains (C) but not (B), so it is a separator. - Circle ((BXY)) contains (A) and (C), so it is not a separator. - Circle ((CXY)) contains (A) and (B), so it is not a separator. - Thus, exactly one separator passes through (X) and (Y). 5. **Counting Separators**: - There are 10 segments that contain 2 points from the set. - Each segment's separator score (number of separators passing through both vertices) is either 1 or 3. - Let (N) be the sum of all separator scores. Since each separator is counted three times (once for each pair of points it passes through), (N) must be a multiple of 3. - (N) is also an even number greater than 10, so the number of separators is even and at least 4. 6. **Bounding the Number of Separators**: - **Case 1**: 5 segments on the convex hull - Each segment on the convex hull has a separator score of 1. - (N leq 5 cdot 1 + 5 cdot 3 = 20), so there are at most 6 separators. - Since the number of separators is even, there are at most 4 separators. - **Case 2**: 4 segments on the convex hull - Let (A, B, C, D) be on the convex hull and (X) not on the convex hull. - (X) is inside either (triangle ABC) or (triangle ADC). Assume (X) is inside (triangle ABC). - Circle ((ABC)) is a separator because (X) is inside it and (D) is outside. - There are at most 3 separators involving segments from the convex hull. - There are at most 2 separators not involving segments from the convex hull. - Thus, there are at most 4 separators. - **Case 3**: 3 segments on the convex hull - Let (A, B, C) be on the convex hull, and (X) and (Y) not on the convex hull. - Segment (XY) has a separator score of 1. - There is only 1 triangle not involving a segment from the convex hull. - There are at most 3 separators involving segments from the convex hull. - Thus, there are at most 4 separators. 7. **Conclusion**: - In all cases, there are at least 4 and at most 4 separators. - Therefore, there are exactly 4 separators.

Approach: 1. **Understanding Compatibility**: Sequences are considered compatible if they match exactly in 4 positions. Thus, for the sequences to be incompatible, they must not match in precisely 4 positions. 2. **Binary Sequences and Combinatorics**: Let's analyze sequences by considering their first 5 positions. The goal will be to group these sequences in a manner where no two sequences in the same group are compatible. 3. **Combinatorial Enumeration**: We will use combinations to count ways of placing either zeros or ones in the first five positions. The total number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 5 for ones (or zeros) is represented by ( C_5^3 = binom{5}{3} = 10 ). This means there are 10 ways to distribute 3 ones among the first 5 positions. 4. **Grouping by Patterns**: We will group sequences based on the positions of the first three ones (or zeros) in the first five positions. Each pattern determines a group. Detailed Process: 1. **Choosing the Groups**: - Consider the positions in the sequence where the first five elements are examined. - Each sequence can be categorized based on where the first three ones (or zeros) are placed in the first five positions. This results in 10 distinct patterns (since ( C_5^3 = 10 )). 2. **Validation with Respect to Compatibility**: - Note that any sequences within any pattern group will have at least 3 matches (positions) out of the five spots chosen for ones (or zeros). - Since we are seeking to ensure that no two sequences are compatible (match in exactly 4 places), sequences within the same group (each with a different first-5-position pattern) cannot be compatible because they already match in 3 out of 5 positions by group definition. 3. **Extending this Logic**: - By similar logic, every sequence with its first five positions having at least three ones can be grouped into one of the 10 categories based on combinations of the first five positions. - Likewise, every sequence with its first five positions having at least three zeros can be grouped into another set of 10 categories (again using the combinations). - This leads us to two sets of 10-group partitions, one for the sequences with three ones and another for the sequences with three zeros, covering all possible sequences of the form described. - Consequently, because any given sequence must belong to one of these 20 groups, we ensure that no two sequences in the same group match exactly in 4 positions.

If not, a vertex of ( P ) or ( Q ) would lie in ( T ), contradicting ( T cap E = emptyset ). - Therefore, ( T ) must have an even number of sides, say ( 2k ). 4. **Case ( k = 2 ):** - If ( k = 2 ), ( T ) has 4 sides, making it a quadrilateral. - Since ( T ) is the intersection of two convex sets, ( T ) itself is convex and non-degenerate. 5. **Case ( k geq 2 ):** - Assume ( k geq 2 ) and consider the configuration where the sum of the areas of ( P ) and ( Q ) is minimal. - Let ( P ) be defined by vertices ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_m ) and ( Q ) by vertices ( Q_1, Q_2, ldots, Q_n ). 6. **Reduction of vertices:** - If a side ( P_iP_{i+1} ) does not intersect ( Q ), we can remove ( P_i ) or ( P_{i+1} ) to reduce the area of ( P ). - Similarly, reduce ( Q ) to have ( k ) sides. 7. **Minimal configuration:** - Assume ( P_1P_2 ) intersects ( Q_kQ_1 ) and ( Q_1Q_2 ), forming a triangle with these sides. - If there is a lattice point inside this triangle or on its boundary (excluding vertices), we can move ( Q_1 ) to this point, reducing the area of ( Q ). 8. **Application of Pick's Theorem:** - By Pick's Theorem, the area of a polygon with vertices on lattice points is given by: [ text{Area} = I + frac{B}{2} - 1 ] where ( I ) is the number of interior lattice points and ( B ) is the number of boundary lattice points. - Since ( T cap E = emptyset ), there are no interior lattice points in ( P ) and ( Q ). 9. **Area calculation:** - For a triangle with vertices on lattice points, the minimum area is ( frac{1}{2} ). - Thus, the area of the triangle formed by ( P_1P_2 ), ( Q_kQ_1 ), and ( Q_1Q_2 ) is ( frac{1}{2} ). 10. **Contradiction:** - The distance from ( Q_1 ) to the line ( Q_kQ_2 ) is minimal, implying ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) are at least this distance away. - However, ( P_1P_2 ) must intersect both ( Q_kQ_1 ) and ( Q_1Q_2 ), which is impossible, leading to a contradiction. 11. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, ( T ) must be a non-degenerate convex quadrilateral region.

If a grasshopper initially at coordinate A jumps over another at coordinate B to coordinate A_1, the new coordinate A_1 can be calculated as: [ A_1 = 2B - A ] Since the homogenity of the systematic coordinate translation follows symmetry logic. 3. **Integral Coordinates during Jumps**: Notice that the coordinates of grasshoppers remain integers throughout the movements. This consistently happens because the calculation: [ 2B - A ] will always result in an integer if both A and B are integers. 4. **Even Distance Movement**: We need to verify that the grasshoppers maintain their relative positioning around zero. When any grasshopper at position A jumps over the grasshopper at position B, the distance moved: [ |2B - A - A| = |2B - 2A| = 2|B - A| ] This shows the distance moved is always even, maintaining the parity of positions. 5. **Returning to Initial Positions**: Given that the distances are always even, let's discuss initially distributed positions for subsequent visual verification. Suppose after a finite series of jumps, grasshoppers return to original places but in a different order. 6. **Proof of Extremities Swapping**: Since each step keeps the positions all the while reflecting integers and the crucial observation that positions itself sways consistency in nature (even positioning).

Similarly, Boris finishes 40 meters ahead of Valentin. Thus, the relationship between Boris's and Valentin's speeds is: [ c = 0.96b ] This implies that Valentin's speed is 96% of Boris's speed. 4. Substituting the speed b in terms of a into the equation for c: [ c = 0.96 cdot 0.95a = 0.912a ] This means Valentin's speed is 91.2% of Andrey's speed. 5. When Andrey runs 1000 meters, let’s find the distance that Valentin covers in the same time. The time it takes Andrey to finish the race can be found by dividing the distance by his speed: [ text{Time taken by Andrey} = frac{1000}{a} ] 6.

Find the ratio (frac{M}{m}) where (M) and (m) are the maximum and minimum values of (|mathbf{a} - mathbf{c}|), respectively. 1. First, use the given conditions to unpack the relationships between the vectors. Given: |mathbf{a}| = 2, quad |mathbf{b}| = 2, quad mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} = 2, From the dot product condition, if ( |mathbf{a}| = |mathbf{b}| ) and ( mathbf{a} cdot mathbf{b} = 2 ), since (mathbf{a}) and (mathbf{b}) have the same magnitude, this implies that they are parallel. Thus, [ mathbf{a} = mathbf{b} ] 2. Now, focus on the second dot product condition: mathbf{c} cdot (mathbf{a} + 2 mathbf{b} - 2 mathbf{c}) = 2. Substitute (mathbf{a} = mathbf{b}) into the equation: mathbf{c} cdot (3 mathbf{a} - 2 mathbf{c}) = 2. 3.

This is described mathematically as: - For row numbers (1, 3, 5, ldots, 19), paint all cells black. 3. **Count the Initial Black Cells**: There are 10 odd-numbered rows in a 19 times 89 grid. Therefore: [ text{Total black cells} = 10 times 89 = 890 ] 4. **Verification of Condition**: Next, we verify that this coloring satisfies the condition that any 2 times 2 subgrid has at most 2 black cells. Consider any such 2 times 2 subgrid in the grid. The possible configurations of such subgrids in relation to our painted rows are: - **Case 1**: Subgrid includes two consecutive rows, one black and one not. This ensures at most 2 black cells. - **Case 2**: Subgrid includes two black rows, which cannot happen because we only painted the odd rows and any two consecutive rows, one of which being black, contains at most 2 black cells. The initial guess ensures no 2 times 2 subgrid exceeds 2 black cells. 5. **Upper Bound and Proof by Induction**: Now we need to prove that this number of 890 black cells is indeed the maximum. We employ mathematical induction to confirm this: - **Base Case**: Consider a simpler, rectangular subgrid of size 2 times (2n + 1). It can clearly have at most 2(n+1) black cells if it satisfies the given condition. Verify for the smallest case with any valid 2n+1. Suppose (n = 1); then the grid is 2 times 3, having a maximum of 4 black cells in this pattern. - **Inductive Case**: Let's assume for an (2k+1) times (2n+1) grid, it satisfies the condition having ((k+1)(2n + 1)) as the maximum number of black cells. We need to establish this for the (2k+3 times 2n+1) rectangle. - Consider an separated single extra block (2-row block in new size) - Suppose row-wise as above, if the additional strip does not exceed 2(n+1) cells. 6. **Final Assembly and Conclusion of Inductive Proof**: By induction, for (2k+3) times (2n+1) grid, ngeq k, we shall have max feasible points ((k+2)(2n+1)) still appending due to above logic of stripping.

This means that they form a three-dimensional configuration. 2. **Identify planes**: - Since ( AB parallel DE ), the points ( A, B, D, E ) lie in a plane, say ( pi_1 ). - Since ( BC parallel EF ), the points ( B, C, E, F ) lie in a plane, say ( pi_2 ). - Since ( CD parallel FA ), the points ( C, D, F, A ) lie in a plane, say ( pi_3 ). 3. **Analyze intersections**: - The intersection of planes ( pi_1 ) and ( pi_2 ) contains the line ( BE ). - The intersection of planes ( pi_2 ) and ( pi_3 ) contains the line ( CF ). - The intersection of planes ( pi_3 ) and ( pi_1 ) contains the line ( DA ). 4. **Parallel planes**: - Since ( AB parallel DE ), the line ( AB ) is parallel to the line ( DE ) in plane ( pi_1 ). - Since ( BC parallel EF ), the line ( BC ) is parallel to the line ( EF ) in plane ( pi_2 ). - Since ( CD parallel FA ), the line ( CD ) is parallel to the line ( FA ) in plane ( pi_3 ). 5. **Contradiction**: - Consider the planes ( pi_1 ) and ( pi_2 ).

Show that there are infinitely many quadruples (a, b, c, d) of positive integers that satisfy a < b < c < d and P(a) = P(b) = P(c) = P(d) .","completion":"To show that there are infinitely many quadruples (a, b, c, d) of positive integers that satisfy a < b < c < d and P(a) = P(b) = P(c) = P(d), we will proceed as follows: 1. **Residue Classes and Prime Divisors**: For a fixed prime p, the numbers n for which p mid n^2 + 1 are in two residue classes: a mod p and -a mod p. This is because if p mid n^2 + 1, then n^2 equiv -1 mod p. The solutions to this congruence are n equiv a mod p and n equiv -a mod p. 2. **Prime Divisors of Specific Forms**: Consider the expressions P(x^2 + x + 1) and P(2x^2). We have: [ P(x^2 + x + 1) = max{P(x), P(x+1)} ] [ P(2x^2) = max{P(2x-1), P(2x+1)} ] These follow from the factorizations of the expressions. 3. **Prime Divisors in Sequences**: We need to show that P(2n-1) le P(2n+1) ge P(2n+3) for infinitely many n. If there were finitely many such n, then the sequence p_n = P(2n-1) would be increasing after a while. However, p_n can be 2 or of the form 4k+1 because it divides a number of the form N^2 + 1. This would imply p_n sim 4n, which contradicts the earlier expressions for large n. 4. **Finding Quadruples**: If P(2n-1) le P(2n+1) ge P(2n+3), then using the expressions from step 2, we get: [ P(2n^2) = P(2(n+1)^2) = P(2n+1) =: p ] Take the smallest a such that p mid a^2 + 1. If a and p-a are not among 2n+1, 2n^2, 2(n+1)^2, then we have found four numbers with P(cdot) = p. The exception is when a = 2n+1 and p-a = 2n^2, so p = 2n^2 + 2n + 1. 5. **Handling Remaining Cases**: If P(2n) le P(2n+1), then from the expressions in step 2, we also have: [ P(4n^2 + 2n + 1) = p ] Similarly, if P(2n+2) le P(2n+1), we are done. 6. **Final Case Analysis**: The remaining case is when P(2n), P(2n+2) > P(2n+1). Using the previous idea, we get: [ P(2n) = P(4n^2 - 2n + 1) = P(4n^2 + 2n + 1) = q ] [ P(2n+2) = P((2n+2)(2n+1) + 1) = P((2n+2)(2n+3) + 1) = q' ] We are not done only when 4n^2 + 1 = q and (2n+2)^2 + 1 = q'. 7. **Conclusion**: For large n, surely p, q, q' > 5. We have (2n)^2 + 1 = q, (2n+1)^2 + 1 = 2p, (2n+2)^2 + 1 = q'. These are not divisible by 5, which is only possible if 2n, 2n+1, 2n+2 are -1, 0, 1 modulo 5, respectively. 8. **Final Step**: Let b be the smallest number such that q mid b^2 + 1. We have b = 2n and q - b = 4n^2 - 2n + 1 and q + b = 4n^2 + 2n + 1. So b equiv -1 mod 5 and q equiv 2 mod 5. We claim that P(3q - b) = q. This is true because (3q - b)^2 + 1 is divisible by 10 (as 3q - b equiv 2 mod 5 and it is odd), and it is smaller than 10q^2. Thus, we have: [ P(b) = P(q - b) = P(q + b) = P(3q - b) ] Therefore, we have shown that there are infinitely many quadruples (a, b, c, d) of positive integers that satisfy a < b < c < d and P(a) = P(b) = P(c) = P(d). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Megan bought 5 dozen eggs and carried them in 5 differently sized trays.

Notice that ( sin(x) - cos(x) = sqrt{2} sinleft(x - frac{pi}{4}right) ), so: [ t = sqrt{2} sinleft(x - frac{pi}{4}right) ] Since ( sinleft(x - frac{pi}{4}right) in [-1, 1] ), it follows that: [ t in [-sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}] ] 2. **Further simplification using identities:** Recalling the double-angle identity, (sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)), we get: [ y = sin(2x) + sin(x) - cos(x) = 2sin(x)cos(x) + sin(x) - cos(x) ] Also recall that: [ (sin(x) - cos(x))^2 = sin^2(x) - 2sin(x)cos(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 - 2sin(x)cos(x) ] Therefore: [ 2sin(x)cos(x) = 1 - (sin(x) - cos(x))^2 = 1 - t^2 ] Substituting this into our equation for (y): [ y = 1 - t^2 + t ] 3. **Maximizing the quadratic expression:** Now we need to maximize the quadratic function ( y = 1 - t^2 + t ).

We need to find the values that the magnitude ( |boldsymbol{a}-lambda boldsymbol{b}-(1-lambda) boldsymbol{c}| ) cannot take. First, let's simplify the expression for the magnitude: [ |boldsymbol{a}-lambda boldsymbol{b}-(1-lambda) boldsymbol{c}| ] 1. Since (boldsymbol{b}) and (boldsymbol{c}) are orthogonal, we can utilize the Pythagorean theorem to calculate their contributions separately. 2. Let (boldsymbol{d} = lambda boldsymbol{b}) and (boldsymbol{e} = (1-lambda) boldsymbol{c}). Then we have: [|boldsymbol{d}| = |lambda boldsymbol{b}| = lambda |boldsymbol{b}| = lambda cdot 2 = 2lambda] [|boldsymbol{e}| = |(1-lambda) boldsymbol{c}| = (1-lambda) |boldsymbol{c}| = (1-lambda) cdot 3 = 3(1-lambda)] 3. Considering the orthogonal property, we can write the resultant vector's magnitude as: [ |boldsymbol{a}-boldsymbol{d}-boldsymbol{e}| = sqrt{|boldsymbol{a}|^2 + |boldsymbol{d}|^2 + |boldsymbol{e}|^2} ] Given (|boldsymbol{a}|=1), (|boldsymbol{d}|=2lambda), and (|boldsymbol{e}|=3(1-lambda)), the magnitude becomes: [ |boldsymbol{a} - lambda boldsymbol{b} - (1-lambda) boldsymbol{c}| = sqrt{1 + (2lambda)^2 + [3(1-lambda)]^2} ] 4. Simplify the expression inside the square root: [ (2lambda)^2 = 4lambda^2 ] [ [3(1-lambda)]^2 = 9(1-lambda)^2 = 9(1 - 2lambda + lambda^2) = 9 - 18lambda + 9lambda^2 ] [ therefore 1 + 4lambda^2 + 9 - 18lambda + 9lambda^2 = 10 + 13lambda^2 - 18lambda ] Thus, the magnitude value: [ |boldsymbol{a} - lambda boldsymbol{b} - (1-lambda) boldsymbol{c}| = sqrt{10 + 13lambda^2 - 18lambda} ] 5. Let's consider the possible value range for (0< lambda <1): - The minimum of the function (10 + 13lambda^2 - 18lambda) can be found by its critical points which are derived from taking derivative and setting to zero. - Since (lambda) is between 0 and 1, evaluate the boundary: - For (lambda to 0), (10 + 13(0)^2 - 18(0) = 10) - For (lambda to 1), ( 10 + 13(1)^2 - 18(1) = 10 + 13 - 18 = 5 ) The effective lower bound (not taking zero explicitly) shows that the function ( 10 + 13 lambda^2 - 18 lambda geqslast value is above 2.

The x-coordinate of the vertex, h, is given by -frac{b}{2a}. Thus, for our function, the axis of symmetry is at: x = -frac{-3}{2cdot 1} = frac{3}{2} Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval [1, frac{3}{2}] and monotonically increasing on the interval (frac{3}{2}, 3]. To find the minimum value of f(x) within the interval [1, 3], we evaluate f(x) at x = frac{3}{2}: fleft(frac{3}{2}right) = left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 - 3left(frac{3}{2}right) + 4 = frac{9}{4} - frac{9}{2} + 4 = frac{7}{4} The maximum value of f(x) within the interval [1, 3] is at either end of the interval, hence at x = 3: f(3) = 3^2 - 3cdot 3 + 4 = 9 - 9 + 4 = 4 Thus, the range of f(x) on the interval [1, 3] is [frac{7}{4}, 4].

However, in your scenario, you have only 1 mole of ethane reacting with 2 moles of oxygen. This is not enough oxygen to completely react with the ethane according to the balanced equation.

Normally, this would be 3 dogs * 4 feet = 12 feet. - However, one dog has a prosthesis, adding an additional foot: 12 feet + 1 foot = 13 feet. Cats: - There are 18 cats.

Let (k) be the size of the subset (S). We need to choose (k) elements out of (n) to form the subset (S). This can be done in (binom{n}{k}) ways. 3. **Permuting the Elements:** For each subset (S) of size (k), we need to place these (k) elements into the remaining (n-k) positions (since (alpha(x) notin S) for all (x in S)). The number of ways to do this is given by (binom{n-k}{k}k!(n-k)!). 4. **Summing Over All Possible Sizes of (S):** We sum over all possible sizes of (S) from (0) to (n): [ sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} binom{n-k}{k} k! (n-k)! ] 5. **Simplifying the Expression:** We can simplify the expression as follows: [ sum_{k=0}^n binom{n}{k} binom{n-k}{k} k! (n-k)! = n! sum_{k=0}^n frac{(n-k)!}{(n-2k)!k!} ] This is because (binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}). 6. **Using the Fibonacci Sequence:** It is known that the sum (sum_{k=0}^n binom{n-k}{k}) is equal to the ((n+1))-th Fibonacci number (F_{n+1}). Therefore, we have: [ n! sum_{k=0}^n frac{(n-k)!}{(n-2k)!k!} = n! F_{n+1} ] 7. **Conclusion:** Thus, the number of pairs ((alpha, S)) is equal to (n! F_{n+1}).

Forward Direction: Assume s is not a divisor of p-1. Suppose s does not divide p-1. Then there exist integers j and r such that p-1 = sj + r with 0 < r < s. We need to find integers m and n such that 0 < m < n < p and left{ frac{sm}{p} right} < left{ frac{sn}{p} right} < frac{s}{p}. Consider m = j+1 and n = j+2. Then: - sm = s(j+1) = sj + s = (p-1) + s - r - sn = s(j+2) = sj + 2s = (p-1) + 2s - r Taking these modulo p, we get: - sm mod p = s - r - sn mod p = 2s - r Since 0 < r < s, we have 0 < s - r < s and s < 2s - r < 2s. Thus, s - r < 2s - r < s. Therefore, left{ frac{sm}{p} right} = frac{s-r}{p} and left{ frac{sn}{p} right} = frac{2s-r}{p}, and clearly frac{s-r}{p} < frac{2s-r}{p} < frac{s}{p}. Reverse Direction: Assume s is a divisor of p-1. Suppose s divides p-1. Then p-1 = sk for some integer k. Consider any m and n such that 0 < m < n < p. We need to show that it is impossible to have left{ frac{sm}{p} right} < left{ frac{sn}{p} right} < frac{s}{p}. Since sm equiv m cdot s pmod{p} and sn equiv n cdot s pmod{p}, and s divides p-1, the sequence s, 2s, ldots, (p-1)s modulo p is a permutation of s, 2s, ldots, (p-1). Therefore, the sequence wraps around at p-1 = sk, meaning ks equiv p-1 pmod{p} and (k+1)s equiv s-1 pmod{p}, cycling back. This implies that the fractional parts left{ frac{sm}{p} right} and left{ frac{sn}{p} right} are not strictly increasing for 0 < m < n < p. Thus, if s divides p-1, it is impossible to find such m and n satisfying the given condition.

From (ii), we have: [ b^{2024} equiv -c^{2024} pmod{p} ] Multiplying both sides by (c): [ b^{2024} c equiv -c^{2025} pmod{p} ] Substituting (c^{2025} equiv a^2 b^{2023}) from the previous step: [ b^{2024} c equiv -a^2 b^{2023} pmod{p} ] [ b^{2023} (b c + a^2) equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Since (p nmid b), we have: [ b c + a^2 equiv 0 pmod{p} ] [ a^2 equiv -b c pmod{p} quad text{(A)} ] 5.

From (ii), we have: [ b^{2024} + c^{2024} equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Substituting (c^{2024} equiv -b^{2024}): [ b^{2024} + (-b^{2024}) equiv 0 pmod{p} ] [ 2b^{2024} equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Since (p) is an odd prime, (p nmid 2), so: [ b^{2024} equiv 0 pmod{p} ] This implies (p mid b), which contradicts our assumption that (p nmid b). 7. Therefore, our assumption that (p nmid a), (p nmid b), and (p nmid c) must be false. Hence, (p) must divide at least one of (a, b, c). 8.

Let's first understand the given inequality: - Given: ( frac{m}{2001} < frac{k}{n} < frac{m+1}{2002} ) - We need to find the minimum possible value of ( n ). 2. Consider the inequality ( frac{m}{2001} < frac{k}{n} < frac{m+1}{2002} ). 3. To ensure ( n ) is minimized, let us consider specific values of ( m ). 4.

Specifically, we can factorize ((x+y)^7 - x^7 - y^7). 3. **Gauss's Theorem Application:** To prove that (n = 7) is the largest such (n), we use Gauss's theorem. Gauss's theorem states that the roots of the derivative of a polynomial lie within the convex hull of the roots of the polynomial itself.

After paying for necessary expenses, she has one fifth of her salary left as discretionary income. So, her discretionary income is S/5. She then allocates this discretionary income as follows: - 25% into a vacation fund - 15% into savings - 30% on eating out and socializing - 20% on self-care and hobbies - The remaining amount, which is 105, is used for gifts and charitable causes. The percentages allocated add up to 25% + 15% + 30% + 20% = 90%. This means that the remaining 10% of her discretionary income is the 105 she uses for gifts and charitable causes. So, if 10% of her discretionary income is 105, then 100% of her discretionary income (which is S/5) would be 10 times that amount: 100% of discretionary income = 10 * 105 = 1050 Since the discretionary income (S/5) is 1050, we can now solve for S: S/5 = 1050 S = 1050 * 5 S = 5250 Therefore, Jill's net monthly salary is boxed{5250} ."},{"prompt":"When two fair dice are rolled once each, what is the probability that one of the upwardfacing numbers is 2, given that the two numbers are not the same?","completion":"Let's compute the probability that at least one of the dice shows a 2, under the condition that the numbers on the two dice are different. Since each die has 6 faces and the two dice are distinct, there are 6 times 5 = 30 possible outcomes where the two dice show different numbers. Next, we determine the number of outcomes where at least one die shows a 2. This can occur in two scenarios: 1. The first die shows a 2 and the second shows a number other than 2 (which can be 1, 3, 4, 5, or 6). 2. The second die shows a 2 and the first shows a number other than 2, similarly having 5 options. Since these two scenarios are mutually exclusive but both contribute to the desired event, they can be added together. Thus, there are 5 + 5 = 10 favorable outcomes where at least one die shows a 2 while the numbers on the two dice are different. Finally, we apply the classical probability formula to find the probability of our event of interest. The probability P that at least one die shows a 2 given that the numbers are different is: P = frac{text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{text{Total number of outcomes}} = frac{10}{30} = frac{1}{3}.

Points M and N satisfy the following system: begin{cases} y = k(x - 1) frac{x^2}{9} + y^2 = 1 end{cases} By eliminating y and rearranging, we obtain: (1+9k^2)x^2 - 18k^2x + 9k^2 - 9 = 0 From this we find: x_3 + x_4 = frac{18k^2}{1+9k^2} quad text{and} quad x_3 cdot x_4 = frac{9k^2-9}{1+9k^2} . Since overrightarrow{RM} = lambda overrightarrow{MQ}, we have the vector equations: begin{cases} x_3 = lambda(1 - x_3) y_3 - y_5 = -lambda y_3 end{cases} Hence, we get: x_3 = frac{lambda}{1 + lambda} . Because line l is not perpendicular to the x-axis, x_3 neq 1. Therefore: lambda = frac{x_3}{1 - x_3} Similarly, we find: mu = frac{x_4}{1 - x_4} . Thus, the sum of lambda and mu is: lambda + mu = frac{x_3}{1 - x_3} + frac{x_4}{1 - x_4} = frac{(x_3 + x_4) - 2x_3x_4}{1 - (x_3 + x_4) + x_3x_4} .

We can use the division formula: x = (Divisor * Quotient) + Remainder Here, the divisor is 44, the quotient is 432, and the remainder is 0. So, x = (44 * 432) + 0 x = 19008 Now, we know that x is also divided by 31 to give a quotient y and a remainder z. We can use the same division formula: x = (Divisor * Quotient) + Remainder Here, the divisor is 31, and we need to find the quotient y and the remainder z. We already know x is 19008, so: 19008 = (31 * y) + z To find y and z, we divide 19008 by 31: 19008 ÷ 31 = 613 with a remainder of 5 So, y = 613 and z = 5.

We know: a^2 + b^2 equiv 0 pmod{7} 2. **Consider the possible remainders**: We first find the possible remainders when a natural number is squared and then taken modulo 7.

Therefore, the goal is to find the value of ( A ). 1. **Setup the Equations based on the given condition**: - The number in ( A ) should be the difference between ( B ) and ( C ): [ A = |B - C| ] - Similarly, the numbers in ( B ) and ( C ) should satisfy: [ B = |D - E|, quad C = |E - F| ] - ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ), at the bottom row, do not need to follow any rule (they are just distinct numbers between 1 to 6). 2. **Test for numbers** that can be placed in ( A ): Since ( A ) must be ( |B - C| ), we know that ( A ) must come from the set ( {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ) but 0 is not in the list of available numbers, it can only be ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ). **Step-by-step testing**: **Testing ( A = 1 )**: - Let's see if we can arrange numbers such that ( A = 1 ). - Assume ( B = 3 ) and ( C = 2 ): ( A = |3 - 2| = 1 ) - Now we need values for ( D, E, ) and ( F ) such that: ( B = |D - E| quad Rightarrow quad 3 = |4 - 1| ) ( C = |E - F| quad Rightarrow quad 2 = |3 - 1| ) Both conditions hold true with suitable arrangements. **Testing ( A = 2 )**: - Let’s try if ( A = 2 ): Assume ( B = 5 ) and ( C = 3 ): ( A = |5 - 3| = 2 ) - Arrange ( D, E, F ): ( B = |D - E| quad Rightarrow quad 5 = |6 - 1| ) ( C = |E - F| quad Rightarrow quad 3 = |4 - 1| ) - Both confirmations are satisfied. **Testing ( A = 3 )**: - Suppose ( B = 4 ) and ( C = 1 ): ( A = |4 - 1| = 3 ) - Arrange ( D, E, F ): ( B = |D - E| quad Rightarrow quad 4 = |5 - 1| ) ( C = |E - F| quad Rightarrow quad 1 = |2 - 1| ) - Validates the condition as well. 3. **Conclusion**: After testing the possible placements for ( A ) being 1, 2, and 3, all conditions are satisfied and prove that these are the only possible values for ( A ).

Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes. - Since each die has 6 faces, and there are 6 dice, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling the dice is 6^6. Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to have all dice show different numbers. - To have all dice show different numbers, we can assign each number from 1 to 6 to a different die. This is essentially arranging 6 different numbers in 6 positions, which can be done in 6! ways. Step 3: Calculate the probability of all dice showing different numbers. - The probability of all dice showing different numbers is the ratio of the number of ways to have all dice show different numbers to the total number of possible outcomes. This gives us dfrac{6!}{6^6}. Step 4: Calculate the probability of at least two dice showing the same number. - Since the probability of all dice showing different numbers and the probability of at least two dice showing the same number are complementary events, we can find the desired probability by subtracting the probability of all dice showing different numbers from 1. - This gives us 1 - dfrac{6!}{6^6} = 1 - dfrac{5}{324}. Step 5: Simplify the expression to find the final answer. - Simplifying the expression, we get 1 - dfrac{5}{324} = dfrac{319}{324}.

The condition frac{alpha}{beta^2} being a real number and |alpha - beta| = 2 sqrt{3} guides us through the solution. 1. **Determining |y| from |alpha - beta|:** From the given |alpha - beta| = 2 sqrt{3}, we have: begin{align*} |alpha - beta| &= |(x + yi) - (x - yi)| &= |2yi| &= 2|y| = 2 sqrt{3}. end{align*} Therefore, we find that |y| = sqrt{3}. 2. **Analyzing frac{alpha}{beta^2} being real:** Since alpha and beta are conjugates, alpha^2beta^2 is real. Thus, frac{alpha}{beta^2} cdot alpha^2beta^2 = alpha^3 must also be real. Expanding alpha^3 gives: begin{align*} alpha^3 &= (x + yi)^3 &= (x^3 - 3xy^2) + (3x^2y - y^3)i. end{align*} For alpha^3 to be real, the imaginary part must be zero, i.e., 3x^2y - y^3 = 0.

For f'(x) > 0, we need (4x - 2)ln x > 0: This occurs when both factors have the same sign; thus we have two cases: 1. x > frac{1}{2} and ln x > 0 (which is true for x > 1). 2. 0 < x < frac{1}{2} and ln x < 0 (which is not possible since ln x is positive for x > 1).

How long will a woman take to complete the work?","completion":"Let's denote the work rate of the man, woman, and boy as M, W, and B respectively. The work rate is the fraction of work they can complete in one day. According to the problem, the combined work rate of the man, woman, and boy is such that they can complete the work in 4 days. Therefore, their combined work rate is 1/4 of the work per day. The man alone can complete the work in 6 days, so his work rate is 1/6 of the work per day. The boy alone can complete the work in 18 days, so his work rate is 1/18 of the work per day. We can write the combined work rate as the sum of the individual work rates: M + W + B = 1/4 We know M = 1/6 and B = 1/18, so we can substitute these values into the equation: 1/6 + W + 1/18 = 1/4 To solve for W, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 6, 18, and 4 is 36. So we convert the fractions: (6/36) + W + (2/36) = 9/36 Now, combine the known fractions: W + (6/36 + 2/36) = 9/36 W + (8/36) = 9/36 Subtract 8/36 from both sides to isolate W: W = 9/36 - 8/36 W = 1/36 This means the woman's work rate is 1/36 of the work per day. To find out how many days she would take to complete the work alone, we take the reciprocal of her work rate: Days = 1 / W Days = 1 / (1/36) Days = 36 Therefore, a woman would take boxed{36} days to complete the work alone."},{"prompt":"Find the ratio of the area of a square inscribed in a segment with an arc of 180^{circ} to the area of a square inscribed in a segment of the same circle with an arc of 90^{circ}.","completion":"1. **Define the Squares and Circle:** Let ABCD be the square inscribed in a semicircle (arc 180^circ) and A_1B_1C_1D_1 be the square inscribed in a quadrant (arc 90^circ).

Given that the base of the tetrahedron ( S-ABC ) is an equilateral triangle, and point ( A ) is on the plane ( SBC ). The projection of point ( S ) onto the plane ( ABC ) is denoted as ( H ), and ( H ) is the orthocenter of ( triangle SBC ). Assume ( SA = a ). We need to find the maximum volume of the tetrahedron ( S-ABC ). 2. Let's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle ( ABC ) as ( x ). The area of ( triangle ABC ) is given by: [ S_{triangle ABC} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} x^2 ] 3. Since ( H ) is the orthocenter of ( triangle SBC ), and the base ( ABC ) is an equilateral triangle, the projection of ( S ) onto ( BC ) is at the centroid ( O ) of ( triangle ABC ). 4. Note that ( O ) is the centroid of ( triangle ABC ), hence: [ OC = frac{2}{3} times left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} x right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} x ] 5. The height ( SO ) can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem in ( triangle SAO ): [ SO = sqrt{SA^2 - AO^2} = sqrt{a^2 - left( frac{sqrt{3}}{3} x right)^2} = sqrt{a^2 - frac{1}{3} x^2} ] 6. The volume ( V ) of the tetrahedron ( S-ABC ) is given by: [ V_{S-ABC} = frac{1}{3} times S_{triangle ABC} times SO ] 7.

Using the chain rule and product rule, this derivative evaluates to: [ frac{sqrt{3}}{12} left( 2x sqrt{a^2 - frac{1}{3} x^2} + x^2 frac{1}{2} left( a^2 - frac{1}{3} x^2 right)^{-frac{1}{2}} left( -frac{2}{3} x right) right) = 0 ] 10.

According to the properties of convex polygons, the sum of the lengths of the projections of the sides of a convex polygon on any straight line is equal to the length of the projection of the polygon onto that line multiplied by two. Mathematically, if P is a polygon with sides a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n, the sum of the lengths of the projections of these sides onto a line L is: [ sum_{i=1}^n text{Proj}_{L}(a_i) ] where text{Proj}_{L}(a_i) denotes the projection of side a_i onto the line L. 3. **Inner and Outer Polygons**: Let P_{text{in}} be the inner polygon and P_{text{out}} be the outer polygon. Since P_{text{in}} lies completely inside P_{text{out}}, every projection of a side of P_{text{in}} onto any line L is completely contained within the corresponding projection of P_{text{out}}.

This sum must respect the preceding inequality for projections on any line. 6. **Perimeter Comparison**: Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the vectors of sides (i.e., the perimeter) of the inner polygon P_{text{in}} must be less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the vectors of sides of the outer polygon P_{text{out}}: [ text{Perimeter}(P_{text{in}}) leq text{Perimeter}(P_{text{out}}) ] # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the perimeter of the inner polygon is not greater than the perimeter of the outer polygon when one polygon is completely inside another. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A hiker walked for 3 days.

The gnoms sitting at the first table can be labeled ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) and those sitting at the second table can be labeled ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_n ).

The total length of the longer base is 20, thus the equation for the bases and the parts of the legs outside the shorter base is: [ y + 0.8x + 0.8x = 20 ] Since the trapezoid is isosceles and tangents from a point external to a circle are equal, the equation involving the lengths of the legs split by the shorter base is: [ 2y + 0.8x + 0.8x = 2x ] Solving these equations: 1.

We need to find the conditions under which the three faces of the parallelepiped sharing a common vertex can be entirely covered by the strips without overlapping or gaps, such that the cells of the strips match the unit squares. The answer to the problem is that at least two of the numbers (a), (b), and (c) must be divisible by 3. Proof: 1. **Case 1: At least two dimensions are divisible by 3.** Suppose that at least two dimensions, say (a) and (b), are divisible by 3. - Any face of this parallelepiped will have sides, some of which are multiples of 3. - This means that each face can be entirely covered by three-cell strips because the side lengths are suitable for the strips to align perfectly along those dimensions. Therefore, when at least two of the dimensions are divisible by 3, we can cover the three faces sharing a common vertex without any overlap or gaps, satisfying the problem's condition. 2. **Case 2: Covering with fewer than two dimensions divisible by 3.** Let's explore the situation when fewer than two dimensions are divisible by 3. - scenario 1: Exactly one dimension is divisible by 3. - scenario 2: None of the dimensions is divisible by 3. **Scenario 1: One dimension divisible by 3.** Suppose that only one dimension, say (a), is divisible by 3, while (b) and (c) are not. - The total number of unit cells on the three faces meeting at a common vertex is (ab + bc + ca). - Since both (b) and (c) are not divisible by 3, neither (bc) nor (ca) is divisible by 3. Thus, (ab) is divisible by 3 while (bc + ca) is not. - Consequently, (ab + bc + ca) is not divisible by 3. A perfect cover with three-cell strips implies having the total number of cells (i.e., (ab + bc + ca)) divisible by 3, which is not possible in this scenario. **Scenario 2: No dimension divisible by 3.** If none of the dimensions (a), (b), and (c) is divisible by 3: - Assign numbers to the rows and columns starting from the edges and color the unit squares alternatingly. - This results in an odd number of white squares on each face (considering that any row or column will alternate in colors and none of them happens to perfectly align into the divisibility by 3). Trying to cover these faces with three-cell strips will always lead to a scenario where we end up needing an even number of cells to be covered to fully accomplish the task. This is a contradiction since you cannot balance covering an odd with even stripping of 3-cells equally distributed. Therefore, covering the parallelepiped with these rules cannot fully be accomplished if fewer than two dimensions are divisible by 3. # Conclusion: To achieve the complete coverage of the three selected faces with the three-cell strips such that there are no overlaps and no gaps, **at least two of the dimensions (a), (b), and (c) must be divisible by 3**.

This translates to the following system of equations: [ left{ begin{array}{l} x - y = 50 6x + 8y = 1700 end{array} right. ] To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination.

Squaring both sides to remove the square roots: [ frac{t}{t + 3} geq (1 - sqrt{frac{1}{1 + 3t}})^2 ] 7. Let (x = sqrt{frac{1}{1 + 3t}}). Therefore, [ frac{t}{t + 3} geq 1 - 2x + x^2 ] 8. Substitute (x) back to obtain: [ sqrt{frac{1}{1 + 3t}} geq frac{5t + 3}{(1 + 3t)(3 + t)} ] 9. Squaring both sides again: [ frac{1}{1 + 3t} geq frac{(5t + 3)^2}{(1 + 3t)^2 (3 + t)^2} ] 10. Simplifying the inequality leads to: [ sqrt{1 + 3t}(3 + t) geq 5t + 3 ] 11. Squaring both sides once more: [ (1 + 3t)(3 + t)^2 geq (5t + 3)^2 ] 12. Simplifying both sides: [ t(t - 1)^2 geq 0 ] 13. Since (t > 0), the term (t(t - 1)^2 geq 0) holds true. Therefore, our assumption holds: [ sqrt{frac{a}{a + 3b}} + sqrt{frac{b}{b + 3a}} geq 1 ] 14. If ( t = 1 ) i.e., ( a = b ), then: [ sqrt{frac{1}{1 + 3}} + sqrt{frac{1}{1 + 3}} = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 1 ] 15. Therefore, when (a = b), the equality holds.

Since each city originally connected to more than ( n ) cities and only two cities ( A ) and ( B ) are closed, each city still has more than ( n - 2 ) connections remaining. 4. **Count Valid Connections After Closure:** - For two cities ( C ) and ( D ) that remain open, denote their shared neighbors. - Since both ( A ) and ( B ) are closed, cities ( C ) and ( D ) have more than ( n - 2 ) roads still available. - Out of ( 2n - 2 ) cities, for two specific cities ( C ) and ( D ), there are ( 2n - 4 ) other cities available besides ( C ) and ( D ). 5. **Overlap in Neighbors Logic:** - Given that ( C ) and ( D ) have more than ( n ) roads among them before closures, and considering they only lose connections to ( A ) and ( B ), at least two cities among their neighbors must be shared to maintain connectivity. - Since removed cities only account for 2 out of possible neighbors, at least two open neighbors are common to ( C ) and ( D ). 6. **Contradiction Derived:** - Given Duke-city connectivity principles, the cities must share at least ( n-2 + 1 = n - 1 ) connections based on overlap guarantees after closure. - This contradicts the assumption of complete isolation from the network of shared neighbors among two unclosed cities ( C ) and ( D ). 7. **Conclude City Connectivity:** - Hence, the assumption ( C ) and ( D ) being disconnected can’t hold because their shared connectivity with open neighbors ensures they must still be reachable. **Conclusion:** The tourist, therefore, can still travel between any two open cities despite the closure of any two cities.

This is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{11}{6} = frac{11!}{6!(11-6)!} = 462 ] 3. **Odd and Even Numbers:** - The balls are labeled from 1 to 11.

The number of ways to choose 2 segments from ( 2n ) segments is: [ binom{2n}{2} = frac{2n(2n - 1)}{2} = 2n^2 - n ] - Since ( 2n^2 - n ge n^2 ) for ( n ge 1 ), we have at least ( n^2 ) parallelograms. 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, there are at least ( n^2 ) convex quadrilaterals (parallelograms) whose vertices are in ( A ) and all of whose diagonals pass through a fixed point.

We want to find two subsets ( A ) and ( B ) such that: [ sum_{i in A} w_i = sum_{i in B} w_i = k. ] Consider the weights ( { k+1, 1, 1, ldots, 1 } ): - Summing these weights, we get: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i = (k+1) + 1 + 1 + ldots + 1 = k+1 + (k-1) = 2k. ] - This satisfies the total weight constraint, but it is impossible to partition them into two equal subsets summing to k grams because: - One subset would need to contain the weight ( k+1 ), which already exceeds half of the total weight k. Thus, in this configuration (( n = k )), we cannot always divide the weights into two equal parts. Hence, the statement is false for case (a). **Case (b): n = k + 1** In this case, we have n = k + 1 weights with a total weight of 2k grams. 1. Similarly, let's denote the weights by ( { w_1, w_2, ldots, w_{k+1} } ). 2.

Therefore, this particular configuration is not viable. To analyze generally: 1. If we have ( k+1 ) weights summing to 2k, we can always form an equal partition because one more weight provides the necessary flexibility to balance both sides. 2. For instance, consider weights arranged such that they sum to 2k. Adding an extra weight allows us the freedom to adjust one side or the other to achieve the balance.

The first player's goal is to choose point P on side AB and point R on side AC such that the area of triangle PQR is maximized irrespective of the point Q chosen on side BC by the second player. **Step 2:** Make a strategic choice for P and R. Suppose the first player chooses point P at the midpoint of AB and point R at the midpoint of AC. Then, P and R are the midpoints of AB and AC respectively. Hence, PR is parallel to BC and PR = frac{1}{2} BC. **Step 3:** Examine the choice of Q by the second player and the area calculation. Whatever the choice of Q by the second player, m_{Q}, the median from Q to BC, will be frac{1}{2} m_{a} (where m_{a} is the median from vertex A to side BC). Therefore, the area of triangle PQR is: [ t_{PQR} = frac{1}{2} times PR times frac{1}{2} m_a = frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} BC times frac{1}{2} m_a = frac{1}{4} t_{ABC} ] Thus, the first player can always achieve an area of frac{1}{4} t. **Step 4:** Confirm that the second player cannot reduce the area below frac{1}{4} t. Consider the second player's strategy to minimize the area. Let the second player choose Q such that PQ parallel AC (or VB, depending on if it is more advantageous). If P coincides with B, let Q also coincide with B.

Using the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality (AM-GM) to maximize the product lambda (1 - lambda): [ lambda (1 - lambda) leq frac{1}{4} ] Thus, plugging into our relationship: [ t_{PQR} leq frac{AC cdot m_b}{2} times frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{4} t_{ABC} ] Therefore, the second player can ensure that the area does not exceed frac{1}{4} t. **Conclusion:** The greatest area the first player can always achieve, no matter how the second player plays, is (frac{1}{4} t).

Additionally, we need to check if numbers beyond n!+n, such as n!+n+1, n!+n+2, ldots, n!+2n-1 are prime. Since numbers of the form n!+kn (for 1 leq k < n) are not primes by construction, we focus on integers between n!+n+1 and n!+2n-1. Each of these numbers needs to be checked for primality.

Case ( n = 2 ): We start by examining the case when ( n = 2 ). The equation simplifies to: [ a_k + 2a_{2k} = 0 quad text{for all } k. ] This implies ( a_{2k} = -frac{1}{2}a_k ). If we assume ( a_1 ) is some nonzero integer, then ( a_2 = -frac{1}{2}a_1 ) must also be an integer. This is only possible if ( a_1 ) is an even number. Continuing this process, we find that ( a_{2^m} = -frac{1}{2^m}a_1 ) for any positive integer ( m ). This requires ( |a_1| geq 2^m ) for all ( m ), which is impossible since ( a_1 ) is fixed and finite. Thus, no such sequence ( {a_k} ) exists for ( n = 2 ). Case ( n geq 3 ): We now consider ( n geq 3 ). We aim to construct a sequence ( {a_k} ) such that the given equation holds for all ( k ).

This ensures the existence of large primes within any interval of sufficient size. Let ( P ) and ( Q ) be the largest and second largest primes not exceeding ( n ), respectively. By Bertrand's Postulate, ( 2P > n ) and ( 4Q > 2P > n ). We define ( a_1 = 1 ) and consider three cases based on the size of ( Q ) relative to ( n ): 1. **Case (i):** ( Q > frac{n}{2} ). Set ( a_x = 1 ) for all primes ( x < Q ) and ( a_{xy} = a_x a_y ). The equation simplifies to ( Pa_P + Qa_Q = C_1 ). 2. **Case (ii):** ( frac{n}{2} geq Q > frac{n}{3} ). Set ( a_2 = -1 ), ( a_x = 1 ) for all primes ( 2 < x < Q ), and ( a_{xy} = a_x a_y ). The equation simplifies to ( Pa_P - Qa_Q = C_2 ). 3. **Case (iii):** ( frac{n}{3} geq Q > frac{n}{4} ). Set ( a_2 = 3 ), ( a_3 = -2 ), ( a_x = 1 ) for all primes ( 3 < x < Q ), and ( a_{xy} = a_x a_y ). The equation simplifies to ( Pa_P + Qa_Q = C_3 ). In each case, by Bezout's Theorem, there exist nonzero integers ( a_P ) and ( a_Q ) satisfying the equation. For all other primes ( p > P ), set ( a_p = 1 ).
