We will show that any set ( M ) with more than 3 points cannot satisfy the given conditions. 2. **Base Case**: Consider an equilateral triangle with vertices ( A, B, ) and ( C ). Clearly, ( |M| geq 3 ) since ( A, B, ) and ( C ) form an equilateral triangle, and for any two points among ( A, B, ) and ( C ), the third point completes the equilateral triangle. 3. **Assumption for Contradiction**: Assume there exists a finite set ( M ) with more than 3 elements satisfying the conditions. Choose two points ( A, B in M ) such that the distance ( |AB| ) is maximal. Without loss of generality, let ( |AB| = 1 ). 4. **Existence of Point ( C )**: By the problem's condition, there exists a point ( C in M ) such that ( triangle ABC ) is equilateral. Assume ( A, B, C ) are ordered counterclockwise around the perimeter of ( triangle ABC ). 5. **Reflections and Disks**: Reflect points ( A, B, ) and ( C ) with respect to the sides ( BC, CA, ) and ( AB ) to get points ( A', B', ) and ( C' ) respectively. Denote the disk with radius 1 centered at a point ( P ) as ( Gamma_P ). 6. **Additional Point ( D )**: Let ( D ) be a point in ( M ) different from ( A, B, ) and ( C ). All points of ( M ) must lie within the intersection of the disks ( Gamma_A cap Gamma_B cap Gamma_C ). 7. **Equilateral Triangle with ( D )**: There must be a point ( E in M ) such that ( triangle ADE ) is equilateral. Consider the two cases for the angle ( angle DAE ): - If ( angle DAE = 60^circ ), then ( D ) lies in ( Gamma_{C'} ) since ( E ) lies in ( Gamma_B ). - If ( angle EAD = 60^circ ), then ( D ) lies in ( Gamma_{B'} ) since ( E ) lies in ( Gamma_C ). 8. **Location of ( D )**: Thus, ( D ) must lie in either ( Gamma_{B'} ) or ( Gamma_{C'} ). Similarly, by considering other equilateral triangles involving ( D ), we find that ( D ) must also lie in ( Gamma_{C'} ) or ( Gamma_{A'} ) and ( Gamma_{A'} ) or ( Gamma_{B'} ). 9. **Intersection of Disks**: Therefore, ( D ) must lie in the intersection of two of the disks ( Gamma_{A'}, Gamma_{B'}, Gamma_{C'} ). Without loss of generality, assume ( D ) lies in ( Gamma_{B'} ) and ( Gamma_{C'} ). However, the intersection ( Gamma_{B'} cap Gamma_{C'} = {A} ), which contradicts ( D neq A ). 10. **Conclusion**: Hence, ( M ) cannot have more than 3 elements.

According to the problem, these times are equal, so we can set up the following equation: [ frac{80}{36 + v} = frac{40}{36 - v} ] Now, we can solve for ( v ): [ 80(36 - v) = 40(36 + v) ] [ 2880 - 80v = 1440 + 40v ] [ 2880 - 1440 = 80v + 40v ] [ 1440 = 120v ] [ v = frac{1440}{120} ] [ v = 12 ] So, the speed of the stream is boxed{12} kmph."},{"prompt":"Which of the following statements is correct?

We start by considering the set ( M ) which consists of 1985 distinct positive integers. Each of these integers is made up of prime factors that are at most 26. 2. The prime numbers less than or equal to 26 are: (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23). Thus, there are 9 primes, and we can denote them as ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_9 ). 3. Any integer in ( M ) can be uniquely expressed in the form: [ n = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_9^{alpha_9}, ] where ( alpha_i ) (for ( i = 1, ldots, 9 )) are non-negative integers. 4. Each integer in ( M ) can thus be uniquely associated with a 9-tuple ( (alpha_1, alpha_2, cdots, alpha_9) ). 5. Consider the parity (odd or even nature) of each ( alpha_i ). For any integer, the parity of ( alpha_i ) can be either 0 or 1, giving us ( 2^9 = 512 ) distinct parity combinations. 6. Since ( M ) contains 1985 numbers and ( 1985 > 512 ), by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one pair of numbers in ( M ) that are associated with the same 9-tuple of parities. 7. Let's select such a pair of numbers from ( M ) and denote them as ( a ) and ( b ). Since their associated 9-tuples have the same parities, we can write: [ a = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_9^{alpha_9} quad text{and} quad b = p_1^{beta_1} p_2^{beta_2} cdots p_9^{beta_9}, ] where ( alpha_i equiv beta_i pmod{2} ) for ( i = 1, ldots, 9 ). 8.

The process above reduces the problem to considering subsets of ( M ) consisting of perfect squares. We repeat a similar argument within the new set of perfect squares. 11. Given that each perfect square can be written as ( (p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} cdots p_9^{k_9})^2 ), considering the tuples modulo 2 again (parity), there must be a subset where at least two numbers have identical parity combinations in their 9-tuples. 12. Let ( c ) and ( d ) be such numbers with ( c = (p_1^{gamma_1} p_2^{gamma_2} cdots p_9^{gamma_9})^2 ) and ( d = (p_1^{delta_1} p_2^{delta_2} cdots p_9^{delta_9})^2 ), where ( gamma_i equiv delta_i pmod{2} ). 13. Then: [ cd = (p_1^{gamma_1 + delta_1} p_2^{gamma_2 + delta_2} cdots p_9^{gamma_9 + delta_9})^2 = left(p_1^{m_1} p_2^{m_2} cdots p_9^{m_9}right)^4 ] where ( m_i = frac{gamma_i + delta_i}{2} ). 14. Consequently, the product ( abcd = left(p_1^{s_1} p_2^{s_2} cdots p_9^{s_9}right)^4 ), where ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) are from ( M ), implying the product is a fourth power of some integer.

Its chemical formula is AlBr₃, indicating that there are one aluminum atom and three bromine atoms in each molecule. To find the element with a mass percentage of 10.11%, we need to calculate the molar mass of aluminum bromide and then determine the mass percentage of each element in the compound. The atomic mass of aluminum (Al) is approximately 26.98 g/mol, and the atomic mass of bromine (Br) is approximately 79.90 g/mol. The molar mass of aluminum bromide (AlBr₃) is calculated as follows: Molar mass of AlBr₃ = (1 × atomic mass of Al) + (3 × atomic mass of Br) Molar mass of AlBr₃ = (1 × 26.98 g/mol) + (3 × 79.90 g/mol) Molar mass of AlBr₃ = 26.98 g/mol + 239.7 g/mol Molar mass of AlBr₃ = 266.68 g/mol Now, let's calculate the mass percentage of aluminum in aluminum bromide: Mass percentage of Al = (mass of Al in the formula / molar mass of AlBr₃) × 100% Mass percentage of Al = (26.98 g/mol / 266.68 g/mol) × 100% Mass percentage of Al = 0.1011 × 100% Mass percentage of Al = 10.11% Therefore, the element in aluminum bromide with a mass percentage of boxed{10.11%} is aluminum (Al)."},{"prompt":"The cubic polynomial p(x) satisfies p(3) = 1, p(8) = 20, p(12) = 10, and p(18) = 28.

Subtracting 1 might result in terms like (-2 cdot 3^j (i = 0, 1, 2, 3)). 5. **Convert Terms to Maintain Allowed Coefficient Restrictions:** - Convert (-2 cdot 3^i) using the transformation: [ -2 cdot 3^i = -3^{i+1} + 3^i ] - This conversion might increase the number of terms, but the initial representation for 1985 contains only seven terms; thus, even after adding an extra term due to the transformation, the total number still does not exceed 8. 6. **Suitable Representation Between 0 and 1985:** - For any integer ( k ) in the range ([0, 1985]), it follows that: [ k = sum_{i=1}^{8} a_i 3^{i-1}, text{ where } a_i in {-1, 0, 1} ] 7. **Handling Negative Integers:** - For integers ( k ) in the range ([-1985, 0]), the coefficients ( a_i ) can be replaced by their opposites (i.e. (-a_i)). # Conclusion: [ boxed{n_i = 3^{i-1}, quad i = 1, 2, cdots, 8} ]"},{"prompt":"Evaluate the expression: some number + 64 − − √ − − − − − − − − − √.

What is the minimum number of weighings on scales, which show the total weight in grams, needed to identify these two coins?","completion":"1. We start by noting that weighing any group of coins can result in one of three possible outcomes: 0, 1, or 2 light coins among those weighed. This corresponds to the scale showing weights in grams of ( 10k ), ( 10k - 1 ), and ( 10k - 2 ) respectively, where ( k ) is the number of coins on the scale. Only these outcomes are possible when weighing ( k ) coins because the weights of the coins are either 9 grams (light) or 10 grams (normal). 2. To establish that at least three weighings are necessary, we note that: - There are 24 pairs of coins that can potentially be the light ones: each of the 16 compartments has either a row pair or column pair, and each has 3 such pairs along the edges, totaling ( 4 times 6 = 24 ). - Since one weighing gives three possible outcomes, two weighings give ( 3^2 = 9 ) outcomes, which isn't enough to uniquely determine the pair of light coins among 24 pairs. Therefore, additional weighings are necessary. 3. Now let’s describe a process to identify the light coins with 3 weighings: - **First Weighing:** Divide the compartments into two symmetric groups (as shown in a partition diagram). Weigh one group. If the result indicates the presence of light coins in one group, we continue with that subset. Otherwise, we split and analyze the results as necessary. - **Second Weighing:** Considering one possible outcome (light coins in one group), we redraw and mark only those coins that could still be light. Again, subdivide and weigh one of the groups. With this second weighing, there will be three outcomes: both light coins are in group A, both light coins are in group B, or one light coin is in each group. - **Third Weighing:** For either scenario (both light coins in the same group or in different groups), use the third weighing to compare specific configurations (like possible horizontal or vertical pairs) until the exact pair of light coins is identified. 4. By carefully choosing the pairs and considering their symmetry, we ensure that the light coins can be identified within the allowed number of weighings. # Conclusion: Thus, it can be determined that the light coins can be found with a minimum of three weighings on the balance.

Now, we can set up a ratio of almonds to walnuts by weight: Almonds : Walnuts = 200 pounds : 80 pounds To simplify this ratio, we can divide both sides by the weight of walnuts: Almonds : Walnuts = 200/80 : 80/80 Simplifying the ratio, we get: Almonds : Walnuts = 2.5 : 1 Therefore, the ratio of almonds to walnuts in the mixture is boxed{2.5:1} ."},{"prompt":"f x5 is a factor of dx^4 + 13x^3 2dx^2 58x + 65, find the constant d.","completion":"Let f(x) = dx^4 + 13x^3 - 2dx^2 - 58x + 65.

According to our assumption, there are cells in these two partitions that are central cells in one partition but correspond to a vertical triminoe, while in the other partition, they correspond to a horizontal triminoe (let's call these colored cells \\"bad cells\\"). 3. Consider an example where in the first partition, a \\"bad cell\\" (K) is covered by a vertical trimino while in the second partition, the same cell (K) is covered by a horizontal trimino. Notice that there could be several such bad cells. 4. We choose the topmost bad cell (K) (if there are multiple such cells, choose any one). 5. Look at the cell (L) that is directly above (K). Since (L) shares a trimino with (K) in the first partition (because (K) is part of a vertical trimino in the first partition), it also participates in that vertical trimino. 6. However, in the second partition, (L) must be part of a different trimino, as (K) belongs to a horizontal trimino. This implies one of the three neighbors of (L) (namely (E_1), (E_2), or (E_3), which are to the right, left, and above (L) respectively) must be colored, as these represent the centers of the trimino that covers (L) in the second partition. 7. This situation results in a contradiction because our assumption was taking (K) as the highest bad cell. However, (E_1), (E_2), and (E_3) lie above (K). This implies that there must be another bad cell above (K), which contradicts our choice of (K) as the topmost bad cell. 8.

Since we are looking for positive intervals (where the inequality is greater than zero), the parabola must be concave down to encompass whole integer values in the solution set. Hence, we establish that m < 0. Next, we can rewrite the inequality by factoring the quadratic: mx^2 + (2-m)x - 2 = m(x^2 - frac{2-m}{m}x - frac{2}{m}) = mleft(x - 1right)left(x + frac{2}{m}right) > 0. Solving mleft(x - 1right)left(x + frac{2}{m}right) = 0 gives us the real roots x=1 and x=-frac{2}{m}. Since the parabola is concave down, the interval between these roots gives us the set of x values for which the inequality is satisfied. For there to be exactly three integer solutions, the smaller integer solution must be 2, as 1 is a root and will not satisfy the inequality. Furthermore, the integers 2, 3, and 4 must be within the interval that satisfies the inequality, and 5 must not be a solution. This constraint leads to: 4 < -frac{2}{m} leq 5.

We need to form this graph such that: - The degree (number of edges incident) of each vertex is exactly 4. - No two edges intersect. We can use the known configuration for a 6-point graph, such as the *complete bipartite graph* (K_{3,3}). Verifying (K_{3,3}) Properties: - **Definition**: A complete bipartite graph (K_{3,3}) is a graph that can be divided into two disjoint sets of 3 vertices each, where every vertex from one set is connected to every vertex in the other set. - **Degree of each vertex**: In (K_{3,3}), each vertex is connected to every vertex in the other set, thus each vertex has a degree of 3. This doesn't quite fit our requirement of each vertex having degree 4, so we must adjust our consideration. Since we need each point to have exactly 4 connecting segments, let's consider a different approach responding to the number of vertices and edges required. 3. **Using Planarity and Non-Intersection**: - **Planarity Condition**: A graph that can be drawn on a plane without any of its edges crossing is called a planar graph. - **Drawing a Planar Graph for this problem**: We need to ensure that the connections are planned carefully to avoid any intersection of edges. Given that 6 vertices are involved and each must have 4 incident edges, we can utilize geometric configurations depicted in standard graph theory depictions to meet this requirement. 4. **Constructing a Planar Graph**: By trial of geometric representations: - Draw 6 points in such a way that each point can be connected to exactly 4 others without intersections. This configuration might look like a star polygon, specific connection of geometric shapes ensuring no crossing edges, careful planning and verifying each segment respects the constraint. After careful construction and testing non-intersecting segments, we ensure each is connected exactly 4 edges, thus verifying such a required graph can indeed be constituted. We can verify this through direct illustrations or constructions resulting in an acceptable graph depiction.

For y=frac{k}{x} to increase, as x becomes less negative (increases), the value of y must increase. This behavior depends on the sign of k: - If k > 0, as x increases (becomes less negative), y becomes less negative (increases). - If k < 0, as x increases, y becomes more negative (decreases). Therefore, for the function to increase as x increases, k must be positive. 2. **Determining the quadrant:** Given that x < 0 and k > 0 (from the behavior of the function increasing), the function y=frac{k}{x} will produce positive y values.

According to the problem, the number of red leaves also equals ( x ), and the number of yellow leaves equals ( 7x ). 2.

According to the problem, the number of yellow leaves today also equals ( y ), and the number of red leaves equals ( 7y ). 4. Therefore, the total number of leaves on the tree today is: [ y + y + 7y = 9y ] 5. Notice that the total number of green and red leaves could not have increased overnight since green leaves can turn yellow or red, and red leaves can only fall. The number of leaves that could possibly remain are those that turned from green to yellow and red leaves that didn't fall off. Initially, the sum of green and red leaves was: [ x + x = 2x ] Finally, the sum of green and red leaves is: [ y + 7y = 8y ] Therefore, we have the inequality: [ 8y leq 2x quad text{or} quad 4y leq x ] 6.

We know that Jerry spent a total of 33 hours to make 9 quarts of syrup. We also know that it takes him 3 hours to make the syrup. Therefore, for each quart, he spends 3 hours making it. For 9 quarts, he would spend 9 * 3 = 27 hours making the syrup. Now, we subtract the time spent making the syrup from the total time to find out how much time he spent picking cherries: 33 hours (total time) - 27 hours (making syrup) = 6 hours (picking cherries). We know that Jerry can pick 300 cherries in 2 hours. To find out how many cherries he picks in 1 hour, we divide 300 by 2: 300 cherries / 2 hours = 150 cherries per hour. Now, we can calculate how many cherries he picked in 6 hours: 150 cherries/hour * 6 hours = 900 cherries. Since Jerry picked 900 cherries in the time it took him to make 9 quarts of syrup, we can now find out how many cherries he needs per quart by dividing the total number of cherries by the number of quarts: 900 cherries / 9 quarts = 100 cherries per quart.

We start by noting that the distance between Q and M minus the distance between Q and N is equal to the distance between Q and P minus the distance between Q and P, which simplifies to the distance between P and M: ||QM| - |QN|| = ||QM| - |QP|| = |PM|. 2. Given that |PM| = 2 and |MN| = 4, we have: ||QM| - |QN|| = 2 < 4 = |MN|. 3. This inequality indicates that the locus of point Q forms a hyperbola with foci at points M and N. To find the equation of curve C, we assume it has the form frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, where a, b > 0. The conditions for the hyperbola are: - The distance between the vertices is 2a = 2. - The distance between the foci is sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2. Solving these equations: left{begin{array}{l}2a = 2sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2end{array}right. Rightarrow left{begin{array}{l}a = 1b = sqrt{3}end{array}right. Thus, the equation of curve C is: boxed{x^2 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1}. Part (2): Proving Line AB Passes Through a Fixed Point 1. Let the equation of line AB be y = mx + t, with A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). 2. For line A_1A, we have y = frac{y_1}{x_1 + 1}(x + 1). Substituting x = 2 gives the y-coordinate of E as y_E = frac{3y_1}{x_1 + 1}. 3. Similarly, for line A_2B, we have y = frac{y_2}{x_2 - 1}(x - 1). Substituting x = 2 gives the y-coordinate of F as y_F = frac{y_2}{x_2 - 1}. 4. Given that E and F are symmetric about the x-axis, we have y_E + y_F = 0, leading to: frac{3y_1}{x_1 + 1} = -frac{y_2}{x_2 - 1}. 5. From the equation of curve C, x_1^2 - frac{y_1^2}{3} = 1, we derive: frac{y_1}{x_1 + 1} = frac{3(x_1 - 1)}{y_1}. 6. Substituting into the equation from step 4, we get: frac{9(x_1 - 1)}{y_1} = -frac{y_2}{x_2 - 1}, which simplifies to: -y_1y_2 = 9(m y_1 + t - 1)(m y_2 + t - 1). 7. This leads to a quadratic equation in terms of y_1 and y_2: ({9m^2 + 1})y_1y_2 + 9m(t - 1)(y_1 + y_2) + 9(t - 1)^2 = 0. 8. From the system of equations involving m and t, we derive: y_1 + y_2 = -frac{6mt}{3m^2 - 1}, quad y_1y_2 = frac{3t^2 - 3}{3m^2 - 1}. 9. Substituting these expressions into the quadratic equation and simplifying, we find that: 3t^2 - 3 - 9(t - 1)^2 = 0 Rightarrow (t - 1)(t - 2) = 0. 10. Since line AB does not pass through points A_1 and A_2, we conclude t neq 1, thus t = 2.

When the train is passing the stationary train, it covers the length of both trains in 25 seconds. We can use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time Let L be the length of the moving train. The total distance covered while passing the stationary train is L (the length of the moving train) plus 360 meters (the length of the stationary train).

The profit for each type A device is the selling price minus the cost, which is 3.3 - 3 = 0.3 million yuan. Similarly, the profit for each type B device is 2.8 - 2.4 = 0.4 million yuan. Therefore, the total profit y in million yuan can be expressed as the sum of the profits from both types of devices: [y = 0.3x + 0.4(50-x).] Simplifying this expression, we get: [y = 0.3x + 20 - 0.4x,] [y = -0.1x + 20.] Thus, the functional relationship between y and x is boxed{y = -0.1x + 20}. **Part 2: Maximizing Profit under Given Constraints** The constraint given is that the quantity of type B multimedia devices purchased should not exceed 4 times the quantity of type A multimedia devices purchased, which can be mathematically expressed as: [4x geq 50 - x.] Solving for x, we get: [5x geq 50,] [x geq 10.] Given the function y = -0.1x + 20 and knowing that the slope k = -0.1 < 0, it indicates that as x increases, y (profit) decreases. Therefore, to maximize profit, we should choose the smallest possible value of x that satisfies the constraint, which is x = 10. Substituting x = 10 into the profit function y = -0.1x + 20, we get: [y = -0.1(10) + 20,] [y = -1 + 20,] [y = 19.] Therefore, to obtain the maximum profit, the company should purchase boxed{10} sets of type A multimedia devices, and the maximum profit is boxed{19} million yuan."},{"prompt":"A cube with a side length of 9cm and its surface painted red is properly divided into smaller cubes with a side length of 1cm.

This means we should explore when f(x) = -f(-x). 1. **For ( x geqslant 0 ):** The function f(x) = frac{2}{e^x}. We need to evaluate -f(-x): [ -f(-x) = -left( frac{2}{e^{-x}} right) = -left( frac{2}{1/e^x} right) = -2e^x ] Thus, for points that satisfy f(x) = -f(-x): [ frac{2}{e^x} = -2e^x ] Solving this equation, we get: [ frac{2}{e^x} + 2e^x = 0 implies 2left( frac{1}{e^x} + e^x right) = 0 implies frac{1}{e^x} + e^x = 0 ] Since both frac{1}{e^x} and e^x are always positive for all x in mathbb{R}, there are no solutions to this equation in the domain x geqslant 0. 2. **For ( x < 0 ):** The function f(x) = 2x^2 + 4x + 1.

For example, (5, 7) and (11, 13). - By definition, twin primes form two consecutive odd numbers since their difference is 2. 2. **Properties of Primes Greater Than 3:** - All prime numbers greater than 3 are odd. - Additionally, these primes cannot be divisible by 3 (otherwise, they wouldn't be prime). 3. **Analysis of Twin Primes Greater Than 3:** - Consider a twin prime pair (p, p+2) where both p and p+2 are greater than 3. - Both p and p+2 are odd, and neither is divisible by 3. 4. **Possible Forms of p:** - An integer can be expressed in three forms modulo 3: p equiv 0, 1, text{or} 2 mod 3. - Since p and p+2 are prime numbers greater than 3, they cannot be 0 modulo 3. - Therefore, they must be p equiv 1 mod 3 or p equiv 2 mod 3. 5. **Modulo Analysis for Twin Primes:** - Suppose p equiv 1 mod 3: Then p+2 equiv 1+2 = 3 equiv 0 mod 3, which is not possible since p+2 would be divisible by 3 and thus not prime. - Hence, p must be 2 mod 3: Therefore p equiv 2 mod 3 implies p+2 equiv 2+2 = 4 equiv 1 mod 3. 6. **Sum of Twin Primes:** - Now consider the sum of the twin primes (p, p+2): [ p + (p+2) = 2p + 2 ] 7. **Factorization and Modulo Calculation:** - Factor out the common term: [ 2p + 2 = 2(p + 1) ] - Recall that p equiv 2 mod 3, so: [ p + 1 equiv 2 + 1 equiv 3 equiv 0 mod 3 ] Hence, p + 1 is divisible by 3. - Thus, 2(p + 1) is divisible by 2 times 3 = 6. 8. **Conclusion on Divisibility by 12:** - Since 2(p + 1) is divisible by 6, we need to check if it's divisible by 12: - Note p being an odd number implies p+1 is even. - Hence, 2(p + 1) is divisible by both 6 (from modulo analysis) and by 2 (from evenness), thus divisible by 6 times 2 = 12.

Our goal is to find a chord that passes through point ( P ) and is bisected by the plane, with additional conditions of the first projection plane being parallel. 2. **First Solution:** - We seek the chord in the plane passing through ( P ) and parallel to the first projection plane. - This plane intersects the sphere in a circle ( k ) and intersects the given plane in a first principal line ( h ). - Draw a line ( q ) in this plane, which is parallel to ( h ) such that ( h ) bisects the distance ( P q ). - Let the line ( q ) intersect the circle ( k ) at points ( Q_1 ) and ( Q_2 ). - The line segments ( PQ_1 ) and ( PQ_2 ) represent the desired chord, as these lines are parallel to the first principal plane and are bisected by ( h ). 3. **Second Solution:** - The locus of the midpoints of chords passing through point ( P ) on the sphere is another sphere, where the diameter is ( OP ), and ( O ) is the center of the original sphere. - The plane passing through point ( P ) and parallel to the first projection plane intersects the original sphere in a circle ( k ), with a center at ( O_1 ), and intersects the smaller sphere in a circle ( c ), and the given plane in another first principal line ( h ). - Let ( H_1 ) and ( H_2 ) be the points where ( h ) intersects ( c ). - The segments ( PH_1 ) and ( PH_2 ) intersect the circle ( k ) at points ( Q_1 ) and ( Q_2 ), respectively. - Therefore, ( PQ_1 ) and ( PQ_2 ) are the required chords. Next, we will show the step-by-step process with these details and confirmations. - Draw an arbitrary plane passing through the points ( P ) and ( O ). This plane intersects the sphere in a circle, and ( PQ ) is any chord through ( P ). - Let midpoint of ( PQ ) be ( F ). - Note that ( overline{PQ} = 2 cdot overline{PF} ) and ( overline{PR} = 2 cdot overline{PO} ) which implies ( FO parallel QR ), [ overline{PQ} = 2 cdot overline{PF} ] [ overline{PR} = 2 cdot overline{PO} implies FO parallel QR ] - Since the triangle ( PQR ) forms a right angle at ( Q ), so does ( PFO ) by Thales' theorem. - Thus, the locus of points ( F ) forms a sphere. - Generally, the problem has two solutions, unless the given plane exactly intersects the distance ( overline{PO_1} ). If the plane fits on ( O_1 ), only one solution exists, otherwise, there are no solutions.

It requires transformational thinking and is of moderate difficulty. Step 1: Given sin (α+dfrac{pi}{3})+sin α=-dfrac{4sqrt{3}}{5}, expand the left side of the equation using the sine sum formula, which is sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. We get: sin α cos dfrac{pi}{3} + cos α sin dfrac{pi}{3} + sin α = -dfrac{4sqrt{3}}{5} Step 2: Substitute the known values of sine and cosine for the special angle dfrac{pi}{3}, which are sin dfrac{pi}{3} = dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} and cos dfrac{pi}{3} = dfrac{1}{2}. This simplifies the equation to: dfrac{1}{2} sin α + dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos α + sin α = -dfrac{4sqrt{3}}{5} Step 3: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation: dfrac{3}{2} sin α + dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} cos α = -dfrac{4sqrt{3}}{5} Step 4: Now, interchange the coefficients of sin α and cos α on the left side, and factor out dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}. This leads to: dfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} sin α + dfrac{1}{2} cos α = -dfrac{4}{5} Step 5: Recognize that the left side of the equation is now in the form of the cosine sum formula, cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B. We have: cos (α - dfrac{pi}{3}) = -dfrac{4}{5} Step 6: To find the value of cos (α+dfrac{2pi}{3}), use the cosine difference formula, cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B. We have: cos (α+dfrac{2pi}{3}) = cos [π+(α-dfrac{π}{3})] = -cos (α-dfrac{π}{3}) Step 7: Substitute the value found in Step 5: cos (α+dfrac{2pi}{3}) = -(-dfrac{4}{5}) = dfrac{4}{5} Therefore, the final answer is boxed{dfrac{4}{5}}, which corresponds to option C."},{"prompt":"Given that each point in space is colored in one of 5 specified colors, and there are exactly 5 points each colored in a different color, prove that there exists a line with points in at least 3 different colors; and there also exists a plane with points in at least 4 different colors.","completion":"We are given that every point in space is painted with one of 5 specified colors. Additionally, we know there are 5 distinct points, each painted a different color. We need to prove the following: 1. There exists at least one line such that at least 3 distinct colors appear on that line. 2. There exists a plane such that at least 4 distinct colors appear on it. 1. First, consider the 5 distinct points, each painted with a unique color. Let's label these points as (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4,) and (A_5). Each pair of these points forms a line. 2. The number of lines formed by these 5 points is given by the combinatorial formula for selecting 2 points out of 5: [ binom{5}{2} = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10 ] So, there are 10 lines formed by these 5 points. 3. Assume for the sake of contradiction that each of these 10 lines has exactly 2 distinct colors. Construct a plane (P) such that (P) is not parallel to any of these 10 lines. This ensures that (P) intersects each of these 10 lines at distinct points. 4. Consider the intersections of plane (P) with these 10 lines. In total, this gives us 10 intersection points on plane (P). 5. According to our assumption, each of these points has exactly 2 distinct colors (which means there are 2 colors per line). Let's label these colors on the points on plane (P) as (C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4,) and (C_5). We've already established that these colors are repeated among the intersection points. 6. Since there are only 5 colors and we have 10 intersection points, and if each line shared points of exactly 2 distinct colors, then it would suggest some of the lines should repeat these color pairs. 7. Take any four of these paint points, labeled (A, B, C, D), which are also in this plane (P). We know they are a part of our initial five points. Among these four points, consider the lines formed by pairs: - (AB) - (CD) - (AD) - (BC) - (AC) - (BD) 8. Because we assumed only pairs of two colors, either one set will create a contradiction: - Suppose line (AB) has the color pairs (C_1) and (C_2), and (CD) with (C_3) and (C_4). - This pattern cannot ensure uniqueness among all 10 initial lines. 9. Therefore, stepping back from our contradiction, at least three must intersect in unique and thus: at least 3 colors in one such line, proving the first part: [ boxed{1 text{ line with at least 3 different colors}} ] 10.

According to the problem, there exists an integer ( m > 1 ) such that: [ x = x^2 + x^3 + ldots + x^{2^m} ] This can be rewritten as: [ x(1 - x - x^2 - ldots - x^{2^m - 1}) = 0 ] 2. **Case 1: ( 2_A ) is invertible:** Suppose ( 2_A ) is invertible. Then, we can multiply both sides of the equation by ( 2_A^{-1} ): [ 2x - 1 - x^{2^m} = 0 ] This implies: [ 2x - 1 = x^{2^m} ] Since ( 2x - 1 ) is non-invertible (otherwise ( x ) would be invertible, contradicting our assumption), we can substitute ( 2x - 1 ) into the original equation: [ 2 = x cdot Q(x) ] for some polynomial ( Q(x) ) with integer coefficients. Since ( 2 ) commutes with ( x ), we have: [ x cdot Q(x) cdot 2^{-1} = Q(x) cdot 2^{-1} cdot x = 1 ] This implies ( x ) is invertible, which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( 2_A ) cannot be invertible. 3. **Case 2: ( 2_A ) is non-invertible and not equal to 0:** Suppose ( 2_A ) is non-invertible and not equal to 0. Plugging ( 2 ) into the equation, we get: [ 2(2^{2^m} - 3) = 0 ] Let ( N ) be the least integer such that ( N cdot 1 = 0 ). Then ( N mid 2(2^{2^m} - 3) ). 4. **Analyzing ( N ):** - If ( N = 2 ), then ( 2 = 0 ), which is a contradiction. - If ( N ) is odd, then ( 2 ) would be invertible, which is a contradiction. - Let ( N = 2k ), where ( k > 1 ) is odd. Then ( k + k = 2k = 0 ), and ( k cdot (k - 1) = 0 ) because ( k - 1 ) is even. Hence, ( k - 1 ) is non-invertible, and there exists some ( n in mathbb{N}^* ) such that: [ (k - 1) = (k - 1)^2 + (k - 1)^3 + ldots + (k - 1)^{2^n} ] This implies: [ k cdot ell = 2 ] for some ( ell in mathbb{Z} ). If ( ell ) is even, we get ( 2 = 0 ), a contradiction. If ( ell ) is odd, it follows ( k = 2 ), a contradiction. 5. **Conclusion:** The only remaining case is ( 2 = 0 ), i.e., ( 1 + 1 = 0 ), which means: [ x + x = x cdot (1 + 1) = 0 quad forall x in A ] # Part (b) 1. **Given Condition:** For every non-invertible ( x in A ), we have: [ x cdot (x^{2^m} - 1) = 0 ] This implies: [ x = x^{2^m + 1} ] 2. **Simplification:** We can rewrite the above as: [ x cdot (x - 1) cdot (x cdot Q(x) + 1) = 0 ] where ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. It is easy to see that ( x^2 - x ) cannot be invertible. 3. **Power Analysis:** Raising to the power ( 2^m ), we have: [ (x^2 - x)^{2^m} = x^{2^{m+1}} - x^{2^m} = 0 ] (using ( x = x^{2^m + 1} )). 4. **Combining Results:** Since ( x^2 - x ) is non-invertible, there exists ( n ) such that: [ (x^2 - x)^{2^n + 1} = x^2 - x ] Combining with the previous result, we get: [ x^2 - x = 0 ] (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"the rectangle (ABCD), point (M) is the midpoint of side (AD), and (N) is the midpoint of side (BC).

Since (N) is the midpoint of (BC) and thus also (NR), triangle (PNR) has (NC) acting as both the median and the altitude of the triangle. 6. **Congruent Angles:** Examining triangle properties and the established symmetry, the problem's assertion follows from the equality of angles: [ angle MNP = angle NPR ] and [ angle QNM = angle QRP ] Based on the geometric properties and transformations, the congruent angles indicate the result as required by the problem statement.

This suggests turning it into a polynomial that does not cross the x-axis, implying all factors create complex roots. 4. **Number of terms:** Since there are 2020 terms in the product ((x-1)(x-2) ldots (x-2020)), each factor is (x-k) where (k) ranges from 1 to 2020. 5. **Understanding real roots:** The polynomial ((x-1)(x-2) ldots (x-2020)) has 2020 real roots, one for each factor. Removing factors one by one removes a corresponding root. 6. **Minimum removals to have no real roots:** Observe the polynomial ((x-k)) represents a linear factor whose root is at (k). If a factor is removed, that specific root disappears. We should figure out how many factors need to be removed to ensure no real solutions exist for the remaining polynomial. 7. **Strategy - Degree of the polynomial:** When removing any (k) factors, we shift from a polynomial of degree 2020 to a polynomial of degree (2020-k). We want a new polynomial that does not have real roots. - A polynomial with a degree of 1 (linear) or 2 (quadratic) can still have real roots. A polynomial’s degree needs to be reduced sufficiently for a significant impact. - Consider polynomials following the pattern ((x-a)^2 + b) where (b neq 0).

For which k can one label the intersection points of these lines by 1, 2,ldots , k1 so that in each of the given lines all the labels appear exactly once?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given ( k ) lines ( l_1, l_2, ldots, l_k ) in the plane such that no two lines are parallel and no three lines are concurrent. We need to determine for which values of ( k ) it is possible to label the intersection points of these lines with the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, k-1 ) such that each line contains all the labels exactly once. 2. **Counting Intersections:** Since no two lines are parallel and no three lines are concurrent, each pair of lines intersects exactly once. Therefore, the total number of intersection points is given by the combination formula: [ binom{k}{2} = frac{k(k-1)}{2} ] This means there are (frac{k(k-1)}{2}) intersection points. 3. **Labeling Constraints:** Each of the ( k ) lines must contain exactly ( k-1 ) labels, and each label from ( 1 ) to ( k-1 ) must appear exactly once on each line. 4. **Case Analysis for ( k ) Odd:** If ( k ) is odd, then (frac{k(k-1)}{2}) is an integer, but (frac{k}{2}) is not an integer. This implies that it is impossible to distribute the labels evenly among the lines. Specifically, since each line must contain ( k-1 ) labels and there are ( k ) lines, we would need to distribute ( (k-1)k ) labels. However, since ( k ) is odd, it is impossible to distribute the labels such that each label appears exactly once on each line without repetition. Therefore, for odd ( k ), it is not possible to label the intersection points as required. 5. **Case Analysis for ( k ) Even:** If ( k ) is even, say ( k = 2m ), then (frac{k}{2} = m) is an integer. We can construct a labeling pattern as follows: - Label the intersection points in a cyclic manner. - For line ( l_i ) and ( l_j ) intersecting, assign the label ((i + j - 2) mod (k-1) + 1). - This ensures that each label from ( 1 ) to ( k-1 ) appears exactly once on each line. For example, if ( k = 4 ): - The lines are ( l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4 ). - The intersection points can be labeled as follows: [ begin{array}{c|cccc} & l_1 & l_2 & l_3 & l_4 hline l_1 & - & 1 & 2 & 3 l_2 & 1 & - & 3 & 2 l_3 & 2 & 3 & - & 1 l_4 & 3 & 2 & 1 & - end{array} ] - Each line contains the labels ( 1, 2, 3 ) exactly once. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the labeling is possible if and only if ( k ) is even.

So, the amount from the 2-dollar coins would be ( 125 - 75 = 50 ) dollars.

Taking the base-10 logarithm of the inequality, we get: [ log_{10}(10^m A) < log_{10}(2^n) < log_{10}(10^m(A+1)) ] 5. Simplifying the logarithms, we obtain: [ m + log_{10} A < n log_{10} 2 < m + log_{10} (A+1) ] 6. Rewriting the above inequality yields: [ log_{10} A < n log_{10} 2 - m < log_{10} (A+1) ] 7.

Each line (y = k) (where (k) is a fixed integer) will alternate colors based on the parity of (x). - If (k) is even, points will be red if (x) is even and blue if (x) is odd. - If (k) is odd, points will be white if (x) is even and red if (x) is odd. - Thus, each color appears infinitely often on horizontal lines. 3. **Verification of Condition 2**: - Assume (A), (B), and (C) are the white, red, and blue points respectively with coordinates: - ( A = (x_A, y_A) ), - ( B = (x_B, y_B) ), - ( C = (x_C, y_C) ). - To form a parallelogram (ABCD), the coordinate of point (D) should be: [ D = (x_D, y_D) = (x_A + x_C - x_B, y_A + y_C - y_B). ] - We need to show that point (D) is red under our coloring scheme. 4. **Details on Parities**: - Let the coordinates follow these parities: - (A) (white): (x_A) odd, (y_A) even. - (B) (red): both (x_B) and (y_B) are either even or both are odd. - (C) (blue): (x_C) even, (y_C) odd. - Calculate (x_D) and (y_D): [ x_D = x_A + x_C - x_B quad implies text{odd + even - (even or odd)}, ] and [ y_D = y_A + y_C - y_B quad implies text{even + odd - (even or odd)}. ] - Inspection of parity results: - If (x_B) is even: - (x_D = text{odd + even - even} = text{odd}), - (y_D = text{even + odd - even} = text{odd}) (or (y_B) odd). - If (x_B) is odd: - (x_D = text{odd + even - odd} = text{even}), - (y_D = text{even + odd - odd} = text{even}). This confirms that point (D) fits into one of the conditions of red points: either both coordinates are odd, or both are even.

And given that f(1) = 0, we have g(1) = 0. Therefore, the function value of g(x) is greater than zero on (-1, 0) cup (0, 1), which implies that f(x) is also greater than zero on (-1, 0) cup (0, 1). Hence, the correct answer is boxed{text{B: } (-1, 0) cup (0, 1)}."},{"prompt":"Let p(x)=x^{3}+a_{1}x^{2}+a_{2}x+a_{3} have rational coefficients and have roots r_{1} , r_{2} , and r_{3} .

For example, when m=34, m_{1}=43, F(34)=frac{{34434334}}{{99}}=9, then F(38)=______.

Forming the first four-digit number by putting m_1 after m gives 3883, and forming the second four-digit number by putting m after m_1 gives 8338.

This means 9a - 9b equiv 1 mod 5. We check the possible values of a - b: - For a - b = 1, 9(1) = 9 notequiv 1 mod 5. - For a - b = 2, 9(2) = 18 notequiv 1 mod 5. - For a - b = 3, 9(3) = 27 notequiv 1 mod 5. - For a - b = 4, 9(4) = 36 equiv 1 mod 5. - For a - b = 5, 9(5) = 45 notequiv 1 mod 5. - For a - b = 6, 9(6) = 54 notequiv 1 mod 5.

Our goal is to determine the minimum distance from the turtle's starting point (the \\"home\\") after 11 hours of movement. 1. **Establish a Coordinate System:** To simplify the analysis, we can place the turtle's starting point at the origin of a coordinate system, (0,0). 2. **Determine the Movements:** The turtle moves straight for each hour and then makes a 90^circ turn. We can consider the directions as follows: - Initially, the turtle moves in the positive x-direction. - After the first turn, the turtle could move in the positive y-direction, negative x-direction, or negative y-direction depending on whether the turn is to the right or left. 3. **Track the Overall Displacement:** By considering the movement in a coordinate grid where each segment is a 5-meter step, we recognize that each hour the turtle moves either 5 meters in the x-direction or y-direction: - If the turn is always at 90^circ, the turtle can only move along the lines determined by 5-meter grid steps. 4. **Practical Computation:** After 11 hours of movement with alternating 90^circ turns and consistent speed, the turtle's position can be simulated for different patterns of movement. For simplification, let's observe the position of the turtle after intervals of movements: [ begin{align*} text{First hour (straight, positive x-axis)} & : (5, 0) text{Second hour (turn and move, positive y-axis)} & : (5, 5) text{Third hour (turn and move, negative x-axis)} & : (0, 5) text{Fourth hour (turn and move, negative y-axis)} & : (0, 0) end{align*} ] Repeating this logic over 11 hours, we can derive that every move increases the turtle's path by 5 text{ meters} interval away from the origin, and turning ensures it can't step back easily. 5. **Evaluating Minimum Distance:** Since each move spans 5 meters exactly, and in 11 moves, one can layout potential minimum paths.

If m in M, then all positive divisors of m are also elements of M. 3. For all elements k, m in M with 1 < k < m, the number k m + 1 is also an element of M. Prove that M = mathbb{Z}_{geq 1}, the set of all positive integers. We proceed by contradiction. 1. **Assumption for contradiction**: Suppose that there exists a positive integer x which is not in M. Let x be the smallest positive integer that is not in M. 2. **Definition of prime factor and product**: Let left(p_{k}right) be the complete sequence of prime numbers in strictly increasing order. Let m be the largest natural number such that: [ p_{1} cdots p_{m} mid x ] where p_1, p_2, ldots, p_m are the first m prime numbers. 3. **Lemma**: For x with m geq 4, it holds that: [ x > p_{m+1}^{2} + 1 ] 4. **Proof of the Lemma**: - For m=4, we check directly: [ x geq 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 210 > 122 = 11^{2} + 1 ] - For m geq 5, by Bertrand's Postulate: [ p_{m+1} leq 2 p_{m} ] [ p_{m} leq 2 p_{m-1} ] Therefore: [ p_{m+1}^{2} + 1 leq 4 p_{m}^{2} + 1 leq 8 p_{m-1} p_{m} + 1 ] Since the product of the first m primes divides x, we have: [ 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot p_{m-1} p_{m} leq x ] Hence: [ p_{m+1}^{2} + 1 < x ] 5. **Finding multiples of x**: For m geq 4, we search for multiples of x of the form k p_{m+1} + 1 such that both k and p_{m+1} are in M, different from each other, and from 1. This will lead to finding a contradiction. 6. **Considering the congruence**: [ k p_{m+1} equiv -1 pmod{x} ] Since p_{m+1} does not divide x, it is coprime to x and there exists a solution k with 0 leq k < x. k neq 0, and: - If k = 1, then: [ x mid p_{m+1} + 1 ] This contradicts p_{m+1}^{2} + 1 < x. - k = p_{m+1} is also impossible for the same reason. - Since p_{m+1} < x and k < x, both p_{m+1}, k in M. 7. **Concluding the proof for other cases**: The proof for m=3, 2, 1, 0 follows similar steps by checking that larger products cannot divide the given expressions: - For m=3, 30 > 8 = p_{4} + 1 shows no multiple of 30 can divide p_{4}^{2} + 1. - For m=2, multiples of 6 do not divide 26.

The goal is to show that a graph (G) is perfect if and only if for every induced subgraph ( H subseteq G ), we have: [ |H| leq alpha(H) cdot omega(H). ] # Necessary Condition: 1. Assume ( G ) is perfect. By definition, for every induced subgraph ( H ) of ( G ), the chromatic number ( chi(H) ) equals the clique number ( omega(H) ). By the definition of the chromatic number, we know that the vertices of ( H ) can be partitioned into ( chi(H) = omega(H) ) independent sets. 2. In each independent set, there are at most ( alpha(H) ) vertices since ( alpha(H) ) is the size of the largest independent set in ( H ). 3. Therefore, the total number of vertices in ( H ) is at most (omega(H) times alpha(H) ): [ |H| leq alpha(H) cdot omega(H). ] # Sufficient Condition: 1. To prove the sufficient condition via induction on the number of vertices ( n ) of ( G ). 2. Assume every induced subgraph ( H ) of ( G ) satisfies ( |H| leq alpha(H) cdot omega(H) ), but ( G ) itself might not be perfect. 3. By the induction hypothesis, every proper induced subgraph of ( G ) is perfect. Thus, for any non-empty independent set ( U subseteq V(G) ), [ chi(G - U) = omega(G - U) = omega. ] - The first equality follows from the perfect nature of (G - U). - The second inequality (omega(G - U) leq omega) is clear since removing vertices can only reduce or maintain the size of the maximum clique. - If (chi(G - U) < omega), it implies (chi(G) leq omega), implying ( G ) is perfect, which contradicts our assumption. 4. For the single vertex set ( U = {u} ), consider ( G - u ) and one of its (omega)-colorings. 5. Let ( K ) be any maximum clique in ( G ). If ( u notin K ), ( K ) intersects all color classes of ( G - u ). If ( u in K ), ( K ) intersects all but one color class of ( G - u ). 6. Similarly, let ( {u_1, ldots, u_{alpha}} ) be an independent set in ( G ), and let ( {A_1, ldots, A_{omega}} ) be the color classes of ( G - u_1 ), ( A_{omega+1}, ldots, A_{2omega} ) be the color classes of ( G - u_2 ), and so on. 7.

For each ( i = 0, ldots, alpha omega ), there exists a maximum clique ( K_i ) in ( G - A_i ). # Conclusion: - The critical observation is if any ( K ) does not intersect ( A_i ), it must intersect all other sets by our construction.

Perform polynomial division or recognize the factorization: [ 2x^4 - x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(2x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 1) ] 5. Substitute these factorizations into the limit: [ lim_{x rightarrow 1} frac{(x-1)(x+1)(x^2 + 1)}{(x-1)(2x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 1)} ] 6. Cancel the common factor ((x-1)) in the numerator and denominator: [ lim_{x rightarrow 1} frac{(x+1)(x^2 + 1)}{2x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 1} ] 7. Now plug in ( x = 1 ): [ frac{(1 + 1)(1^2 + 1)}{2 cdot 1^3 + 2 cdot 1^2 + 1 + 1} = frac{(2)(2)}{2 + 2 + 1 + 1} = frac{4}{6} = frac{2}{3} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{2}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let the random variable xi follow a normal distribution N(2,9).

Since B invests double the amount of A after 6 months, B's investment would be ( 2x ). C invests a certain multiple of A's investment after 8 months, let's denote that multiple as ( m ), so C's investment would be ( mx ). The profit is distributed according to the product of the investment and the time for which the money was invested. Since the profit is for a year (12 months), we calculate each partner's investment multiplied by the time their money was invested. A's investment was for the entire year, so A's share is ( x times 12 ). B's investment was for 6 months, so B's share is ( 2x times 6 ).

The ratio of the total gain to A's gain should be the same as the ratio of the total investment-time to A's investment-time. So, we have: [ frac{12,000}{4,000} = frac{x times 12 + 2x times 6 + mx times 4}{x times 12} ] Simplifying the left side, we get: [ 3 = frac{12x + 12x + 4mx}{12x} ] Further simplifying, we get: [ 3 = 1 + 1 + frac{4mx}{12x} ] Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: [ 1 = frac{4mx}{12x} ] Simplifying the right side, we get: [ 1 = frac{mx}{3} ] Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: [ 3 = mx ] So, the multiple ( m ) that C invested is boxed{3} times A's investment.

This occurs if T is in the exact middle of the row at any given step. - If T is at one of the ends, it can be preserved by always selecting cards from the opposite end in the eliminating process. 4. **Case When T is Not on the Edge:** - Let's assume T is initially not on the edge. - Consider two potential strategies for the spectator that hinder T from staying until the end. 5. **Spectator Strategy 1: Avoid Edges:** - The spectator avoids suggesting the removal of edge positions, meaning only non-edge cards are suggested. - Eventually, when only 3 cards are left, if T remains it will be in the middle and thus can be called out as the second card to be removed by the spectator. 6. **Spectator Strategy 2: Matching Position:** - The spectator always names the current position of T. - The magician has no choice but to discard a different card (since the spectator systematically narrows down the positions). - This decreases the distance to the edges by 1 until inevitably creating a scenario where T is in the middle and must be removed. 7. **Ensuring Success:** - Placing T at an edge ensures it can be preserved throughout the elimination process. - With T at an edge, even if the number of calls matches the edge, T remains as long as non-edge cards are available to eliminate. **Conclusion:** Thus, the magician can guarantee the success of the trick if and only if the three of clubs is initially placed at one of the edges.

For what maximum ( k ) can any good number be transformed into any other good number using such moves?","completion":"# Problem: A natural number is called *good* if all of its digits are non-zero. A good number is termed *special* if at least k of its digits are in strictly increasing order from left to right. Given a good number, one is allowed to append or insert a special number at any position in the existing number, or remove a special number from it. What is the largest k for which it is possible to transform any good number into any other good number using such operations? 1. **Identify the Structure of Special Numbers**: - A special number has at most 9 digits since all digits must be unique and strictly increasing sequence given they can only be from 1 to 9. 2. **Operation Validity**: - When ( k = 9 ), every operation would either add or remove exactly 9 digits. Therefore, the remainder when the number of digits is divided by 9 always remains the same. This suggests it is impossible to change a single-digit number into a two-digit number through these operations. Thus, ( k = 9 ) is not feasible. 3. **Consider ( k = 8 )**: - Since each operation involves adding or removing an 8-digit number, it’s crucial to verify if it’s independently possible to insert any digit into or remove any digit from any position of a good number. 4. **Proof by Induction**: - **Base Case**: For inserting the digit 1: - Insert the sequence 123456789 and then delete the digits 23456789. After the sequence of operations, only digit 1 remains inserted. - **Inductive Step**: - Suppose we can insert digits from 1 up to ( n - 1 ) where ( n - 1 < 9 ). We need to show that we can insert the digit ( n ). - **Inserting digit ( n )**: - First, insert the sequence 123456789. - Then, remove each digit from 1 to ( n-1 ) one by one. - Insert the digits 1 to ( n-1 ) again to the right of ( n ). - Finally, remove the sequence ( 12 ldots (n-1)(n+1) ldots 9 ). - If ( n = 9 ), the last two actions are unnecessary. - For ( n = 8 ), remove the sequence 1279. This process shows that with ( k = 8 ), it is possible to insert any desired digit into the sequence, leveraging reversibility of operations. # Conclusion: Thus, the largest ( k ) for which the transformation of any good number into any other good number is always possible with the given operations is ( k = 8 ).

The greedy algorithm works as follows: At each step, choose the largest number from ( {1^{2018}, 2^{2018}, ldots, n^{2018}} ) such that the sum of the chosen numbers remains smaller than ( frac{S_n}{2} ). Assign ( - ) to each chosen number and ( + ) to all other numbers. 4. We claim that this difference is bounded above. To show this, consider the function: [ f(X) = X^{2018} + (X-1)^{2018} - (X+1)^{2018} ] Since ( f(X) ) is a monic polynomial, there exists a fixed positive integer ( C ) such that for every integer ( m geq C ), we have ( f(m) > 0 ), i.e., [ (m+1)^{2018} < m^{2018} + (m-1)^{2018} ] 5. **Claim:** If ( n ) is large enough, then at least one of ( C^{2018} ) and ( (C-1)^{2018} ) is not chosen. 6. **Proof:** Assume the contrary. Notice that from the way the algorithm is defined, if for some integer ( a geq C ), both ( a^{2018} ) and ( (a-1)^{2018} ) are chosen, then ( (a+1)^{2018} ) must be chosen too.

Assume the following effectiveness for washing with a fixed amount of water: 1 unit of water can wash away frac{1}{2} of the pesticide residues on the vegetables.

Let f(x) denote the ratio of pesticide residues left on the vegetables after washing with x units of water to the amount of residue before washing. 1. Determine the value of f(0) and explain its practical significance. 2. Based on the assumption, write down the conditions and properties that the function f(x) should satisfy. 3.

Which washing method results in less pesticide residue on the vegetables? Explain the reasoning.","completion":"1. For the first part of the problem, we need to determine the value of f(0) and explain its practical significance. - Given that using 1 unit of water can wash away frac{1}{2} of the pesticide residue on the vegetable, if no water is used, no pesticide is washed away. - Mathematically, this can be expressed as: [ f(0) = 1 ] - This means that with 0 units of water, the amount of pesticide residue remains unchanged on the vegetables. Practically, it means that if no cleaning is done, the pesticide level remains the same as it originally is. 2. The second part involves identifying the conditions and properties that the function f(x) must satisfy based on the problem statement. - From the problem, the conditions required for the function f(x) are: [ f(0) = 1 text{ and } f(1) = frac{1}{2} ] - The function f(x) represents the fraction of pesticide residue remaining after washing with x units of water. As the amount of water increases, the pesticide residue should decrease. Hence, f(x) is a decreasing function. - The range of f(x) should lie between 0 and 1, since the fraction of pesticide residue cannot be negative or greater than the original: [ 0 < f(x) leq 1 quad text{for} quad x geq 0 ] - Therefore, the function f(x) should be a monotonically decreasing function on the interval ([0, +infty)) with values strictly between 0 and 1. 3. For the third part, given the function f(x) = frac{1}{1+x^2}, we need to compare the effectiveness of one cleaning operation using a units of water versus two separate cleanings using frac{a}{2} units of water each. - If the vegetables are washed once with a units of water, the amount of pesticide residue left is given by: [ f_1 = f(a) = frac{1}{1 + a^2} ] - If the same amount of water is divided into two equal parts and used in two separate washings, each washing will use frac{a}{2} units of water. - The residue after the first wash using frac{a}{2} units will be: [ fleft(frac{a}{2}right) = frac{1}{1 + left(frac{a}{2}right)^2} = frac{1}{1 + frac{a^2}{4}} ] - After the second wash, the function will be applied again to the residue from the first wash: [ f_2 = fleft(frac{a}{2}right) cdot fleft(frac{a}{2}right) = left( frac{1}{1 + frac{a^2}{4}} right)^2 = frac{1}{(1 + frac{a^2}{4})^2} ] - Let us simplify this expression: [ f_2 = left( frac{1}{1 + frac{a^2}{4}} right)^2 = left( frac{4}{4 + a^2} right)^2 = frac{16}{(4 + a^2)^2} ] - Now, we compare f_1 and f_2: [ f_1 = frac{1}{1 + a^2} ] [ f_2 = frac{16}{(4 + a^2)^2} ] - To determine when one method leads to less residue than the other, we calculate the difference: [ f_1 - f_2 = frac{1}{1 + a^2} - frac{16}{(4 + a^2)^2} ] - Finding a common denominator: [ f_1 - f_2 = frac{(4 + a^2)^2 - 16(1 + a^2)}{(1 + a^2)(4 + a^2)^2} ] - Simplifying the numerator: [ (4 + a^2)^2 - 16(1 + a^2) = 16 + 8a^2 + a^4 - 16 - 16a^2 = a^4 - 8a^2 ] - So, we have: [ f_1 - f_2 = frac{a^2(a^2 - 8)}{(1 + a^2)(4 + a^2)^2} ] - Analyzing the sign of a^2(a^2 - 8), we see: - When a > 2sqrt{2}, a^2 - 8 > 0, so f_1 > f_2 - When a = 2sqrt{2}, a^2 - 8 = 0, so f_1 = f_2 - When 0 < a < 2sqrt{2}, a^2 - 8 < 0, so f_1 < f_2 - Conclusion: - For a > 2sqrt{2}, washing twice is more effective. - For a = 2sqrt{2}, both methods are equally effective. - For 0 < a < 2sqrt{2}, one wash is more effective.

The first n pencils in this box are all of the same color, and the last n pencils are also all of the same color. Thus, all the pencils in our box are of the same color.

Now, find the error!","completion":"1. **Initialization Step:** The property we want to show is that every box of colored pencils contains only pencils of the same color. We begin by confirming the property for ( n = 1 ): - A box containing a single pencil (( n = 1 )) necessarily contains only pencils of the same color (trivially true). 2. **Hereditary Step:** Next, we assume there exists an integer ( n ) such that every box containing ( n ) pencils consists solely of pencils of the same color. This is our induction hypothesis. 3. **Considering a Box with ( n+1 ) Pencils:** Suppose we have a box with ( n+1 ) pencils. We can consider two subsets within this box: - The first ( n ) pencils. - The last ( n ) pencils. According to our induction hypothesis: - The first ( n ) pencils are all of the same color. - The last ( n ) pencils are also all of the same color. 4. **Mistake in the Argument:** The argument fails when applied to the case ( n = 2 ). Let's break it down: - For ( n = 2 ), our box would have 3 pencils. It is claimed that the first 2 are of the same color and the last 2 are of the same color. - However, there is no guarantee that the middle pencil, which appears in both subsets, enforces consistency across all 3 pencils. The issue becomes clear when the box contains 2 pencils. There is no overlapping pencil when applying the induction step, contradicting the assumption that both the first and last groups have a common pencil to compare. # Conclusion: The proposed proof fails for ( n = 2 ) as it implicitly assumes overlapping pencils to justify the same color for all pencils. This assumption does not hold when transitioning from ( n = 1 ) to ( n = 2 ). Thus, the property is inherently false for ( n geq 2 ).

The problem states that the sum of the first two digits of the year (a + b) is equal to the difference of the last two digits (c - d). 3. Notice that the difference (c - d) for any two digits (c) and (d) ranges from -9 to 9. However, as we are dealing with digits of a year, both (c) and (d) must be between 0 and 9, making their difference a non-negative integer less than 10. 4. For the sum (a + b) to be equal to a valid difference (c - d), it must also be less than or equal to 9 (since (c - d) has this constraint). 5. The constraint (a + b leq 9) limits us to specific starting years. If the neighbor was born in the 20th century (1900-1999), then (a) would be 1 and (b) would range from 0 to 9, making (a + b) range from 1 to 10, which is outside the given constraint. 6. Therefore, the neighbor must have been born in the 19th century (1800-1899). Here, (a = 1) and (b = 8), making (a + b = 1 + 8 = 9), which fits our constraint perfectly. 7.

We can label this edge with ( 1 ). Since there are no vertices with more than one edge, the condition is trivially satisfied. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume the statement is true for all connected graphs with ( k = 1, 2, ldots, r-1 ) edges. We will show that the statement is true for ( k = r ). 3. **Case 1: Existence of a Vertex with Degree 1** - Suppose there exists a vertex ( v_1 in G ) such that ( deg(v_1) = 1 ). Let ( v_2 ) be the neighbor of ( v_1 ). - If ( deg(v_2) > 2 ), we stop. Otherwise, if ( deg(v_2) = 2 ), let ( v_3 ) be the other neighbor of ( v_2 ). Repeat this process until we find a vertex ( v_ell ) such that ( deg(v_ell) neq 2 ). - We now have a path ( v_1 rightarrow v_2 rightarrow cdots rightarrow v_ell ) where ( deg(v_1) = 1 ), ( deg(v_2) = deg(v_3) = cdots = deg(v_{ell-1}) = 2 ), and ( deg(v_ell) neq 2 ). - Label the edges as follows: [ begin{aligned} &v_1v_2 text{ with } k, &v_2v_3 text{ with } k-1, &cdots, &v_{ell-1}v_ell text{ with } k - ell + 2. end{aligned} ] - The labels on each ( v_i ) for ( 2 leq i leq ell-1 ) differ by 1, so their gcd is 1. Thus, the condition is satisfied for all such ( v_i ). 4. **Induced Graph:** - Remove vertices ( v_1, v_2, cdots, v_{ell-1} ) and their edges. The induced graph has ( k - (ell - 1) = k - ell + 1 ) edges and is still connected unless it is empty. - If the induced graph is empty, ( G ) is just the path ( v_1 rightarrow v_2 rightarrow cdots rightarrow v_ell ), and ( deg(v_1) = deg(v_ell) = 1 ), so the condition does not apply to these vertices. We have shown the condition holds for all other vertices. - If the induced graph is nonempty and connected, by the inductive hypothesis, we can label its edges ( 1, 2, cdots, k - ell + 1 ) so that the condition is satisfied. 5. **Combining Labelings:** - The labelings are fine for ( v_1v_2, v_2v_3, cdots, v_{ell-2}v_{ell-1} ) since they are only adjacent to other ( v_iv_{i+1} )'s. - The labelings are fine in the induced graph for every edge not connected to ( v_ell ). - For ( v_ell ), the degree in the induced graph is at least 2, so the gcd of the edges connected to ( v_ell ) in the induced graph is 1. Thus, the gcd of the labels in ( G ) is also 1. 6. **Case 2: No Vertex with Degree 1** - If no vertex in ( G ) has degree 1, then ( deg(v) geq 2 ) for all ( v in G ). Thus, there exists a cycle of length at least 3 in ( G ) (a well-known fact that there exists a cycle of length (text{mindeg } v + 1) in a graph). - Let ( c_1 rightarrow c_2 rightarrow cdots rightarrow c_ell ) be a cycle in ( G ) for some ( ell geq 3 ). 7. **Subcase: More than One Vertex with Degree at Least 3 in the Cycle** - Let ( i_1 ) be the smallest index such that ( deg(c_{i_1}) geq 3 ), and ( i_2 ) be the second smallest such index. - Consider the path ( c_{i_1} rightarrow c_{i_1+1} rightarrow cdots rightarrow c_{i_2} ). For any ( i_1 < j < i_2 ), ( deg(c_j) = 2 ). - Label the edges as follows: [ begin{aligned} &c_{i_1}c_{i_1+1} text{ with } k, &c_{i_1+1}c_{i_1+2} text{ with } k-1, &cdots, &c_{i_2-1}c_{i_2} text{ with } k - (i_2 - i_1 - 1). end{aligned} ] - Remove these edges and vertices ( c_{i_1+1}, c_{i_1+2}, cdots, c_{i_2-1} ). The resulting graph is connected and has ( k - (i_2 - i_1) ) edges. - By the inductive hypothesis, we can label the edges ( 1, 2, cdots, k - (i_2 - i_1) ) so that the condition is satisfied. 8. **Combining Labelings:** - For each vertex ( v notin {c_{i_1}, c_{i_1+1}, cdots, c_{i_2}} ), the condition is satisfied since no new edges are added. - For ( c_{i_1+1}, c_{i_1+2}, cdots, c_{i_2-1} ), they all have degree 2 and their labels are adjacent numbers, so their gcd is 1. - For ( c_{i_1} ) and ( c_{i_2} ), they have degree at least 3, so they must have had degree at least 2 in the reduced graph, and the gcd of the labels in the reduced graph is 1. Thus, the gcd is 1 for ( c_{i_1} ) and ( c_{i_2} ) in ( G ). 9. **Subcase: All Vertices in the Cycle Have Degree 2** - If all vertices in the cycle have degree 2, then ( G ) must be just that cycle since ( G ) is connected. Label the edges ( 1, 2, cdots, k ) in that order, and it clearly works. 10. **Subcase: Exactly One Vertex in the Cycle with Degree 3** - Let ( v_1 ) be the vertex with degree 3. Let ( v_1, v_2, cdots, v_r ) be the vertices in the cycle. - Label the edges as follows: [ begin{aligned} &v_1v_2 text{ with } k, &v_2v_3 text{ with } k-1, &cdots, &v_{r-1}v_r text{ with } k - (r-2), &v_rv_1 text{ with } k - (r-1). end{aligned} ] - If ( deg(v_1) > 3 ), remove all the edges ( v_iv_{i+1} ) and ( v_rv_1 ), and the vertices ( v_2, cdots, v_r ). The resulting graph is connected and has ( k - r ) edges. - By the inductive hypothesis, we can label the edges ( 1, 2, cdots, k - r ) so that it works on the reduced graph. 11. **Combining Labelings:** - For all vertices not in ( {v_i} ) or ( {v_{1,j}} ), the condition is satisfied since no new edges are added. - For ( v_{1,2}, v_{1,3}, cdots, v_{1,ell-1} ), their neighboring edges have labels that are adjacent numbers, so their gcd is 1. - For ( v_1 ), the degree in the reduced graph is at least 2, so the gcd of the labels in the reduced graph is 1. Thus, the gcd is 1 for ( v_1 ) in ( G ). Thus, in all cases, our inductive step is complete, and so we are done.

Therefore, ( P_1 = 0 ). - For ( n = 2 ): There are two boxes, and both must have the same color to satisfy the condition.

Let T denote any of these triangles. - The hypotenuse of each triangle is denoted as 1, and the other two sides are denoted as p and q. 2. **Transformation Process:** - Each time we choose a triangle, draw the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse, which results in two new similar triangles. - The two new triangles created are similar to the original triangle T, with proportions p and q. 3. **Characterization of Triangles:** - Each triangle T obtained in this process can be characterized by integers m and n such that the similarity ratio of T to the initial triangle is p^m q^n. - Each cutting step transforms a triangle (m, n) into two triangles: (m+1, n) and (m, n+1). 4. **Invariant Function Definition:** - We associate a function I to a set of triangles, defined as: [ I = sum frac{1}{2^{m+n}} ] - This function I is invariant under the transformations described. 5. **Initial Value Calculation:** - Initially: [ I = sum frac{1}{2^{0+0}} = 4 times frac{1}{2^0} = 4 ] - Therefore, I remains 4 throughout the process. 6. **Contradiction Argument:** - Assume, for contradiction, that after a finite number of steps all triangles become non-congruent. - Let M and N be the bounds for m and n, respectively, over the set of triangles. - Considering the contributions to I from these bounds, we get: [ sum frac{1}{2^m} leq 2 - frac{1}{2^{M+1}} ] [ sum frac{1}{2^n} leq 2 - frac{1}{2^{N+1}} ] 7. **Final Calculation:** - Hence: [ I < left(2 - frac{1}{2^{M+1}}right)left(2 - frac{1}{2^{N+1}}right) ] - Utilizing the inequality properties: [ I < 4 - 2left(frac{1}{2^{M+1}}right) - 2left(frac{1}{2^{N+1}}right) + frac{1}{2^{M+1+N+1}} ] - Since each term on the right-hand side decreases the total sum, we conclude: [ I < 4 ] 8. **Conclusion:** - This contradiction implies that it is not possible for all triangles to become non-congruent after a finite number of steps.

We need to determine the behavior of this function. By analyzing the function, we find that it is monotonically increasing over the real numbers. This is because as x increases, 2^x increases at a faster rate than 3^{-x} decreases, making f(x) increase. Given that f(x) is monotonically increasing and f(x) < f(y), it follows that x < y. This implies: [y - x > 0] Adding 1 to both sides, we get: [y - x + 1 > 1] Taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we obtain: [ln(y - x + 1) > ln(1) = 0] Therefore, we have shown that ln(y - x + 1) > 0. **Method 2: Testing with Specific Values** To further validate our answer, we can test the inequality with specific values of x and y.

Hence, we compute the dot product: (1, 3) cdot (-1, k) = (-1) cdot 1 + 3 cdot k = 0. This simplifies to -1 + 3k = 0, which can be solved for k as follows: 3k = 1, k=frac{1}{3}. Now, we have the direction vector mathbf{b} = (-1, frac{1}{3}) for line l_2. Since line l_2 passes through the point (0, 5), we can write its point-slope form equation: y - y_0 = m(x - x_0), where (x_0, y_0) is the point (0, 5), and m is the slope of the line. The slope can be found by dividing the y-component by the x-component of the direction vector mathbf{b}: m = frac{1/3}{-1} = -frac{1}{3}. So, the equation of line l_2 becomes: y - 5 = -frac{1}{3}(x - 0), which simplifies to: y = -frac{1}{3}x + 5.

Let the vertices of the square be (A(x, y)), (B(y, -x)), (C(-x, -y)), and (D(-y, x)). 2. **Coordinates of Points (Q) and (P):** - Point (Q) is the midpoint of side (AB): [ Q = left( frac{x + y}{2}, frac{y - x}{2} right) ] - Point (P) is the foot of the perpendicular dropped from (D) onto the fixed line (l), defined by (y = a).

The condition for these terms to be in arithmetic progression is: [ (x+i)(x+k) = (x+j)^2 ] Expanding both sides, we have: [ x^2 + (i+k)x + i k = x^2 + 2jx + j^2 ] Canceling ( x^2 ) on both sides, we get: [ (i+k)x + i k = 2jx + j^2 ] Rearranging terms to isolate ( x ): [ (i+k-2j)x = j^2 - ik ] Therefore, we can solve for ( x ): [ x = frac{j^2 - ik}{i+k-2j} ] Since ( i+j+k > i+j+j > i+j ), it follows that ( i+k-2j neq 0 ).

Setting: [ x, xq, xq^2 ] forms the desired progression. 2. **Case 2:** If ( x = frac{n}{m} ), where ( n ) and ( m ) are coprime positive integers with ( m neq 1 ), we can show that the terms ( x, x+n, x+(m+2)n ) form an arithmetic progression. Computing explicitly, we express: [ x left(x + (m+2)nright) = frac{n}{m} left( frac{n}{m} + mn + 2n right) ] Simplifying the right-hand side: [ frac{n}{m} left( frac{n}{m} + mn + 2n right) = frac{n^2}{m^2} + n^2 + 2 frac{n^2}{m} = left( frac{n}{m} + n right)^2 ] Therefore: [ x left( x + (m+2)n right) = (x+n)^2 ] This proves our claim, as ( x, x+n, x+(m+2)n ) form an arithmetic progression.

We observe that: - The sum of (1) and (2) is (3), which is divisible by (3). - The sum of (1) and (3) is (4), which is divisible by (2). - The sum of (2) and (3) is (5), which is divisible by (1). In this set of three numbers, each number satisfies the condition that the sum of the other two is divisible by it. **Step 2: Extending the Example** We now add another number which is the sum of the initial three numbers: [ 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 ] Thus, our new set is ({1, 2, 3, 6}). We need to check if this new set of four numbers maintains the divisibility property: - Sum of any three numbers equals the total sum ((12)) minus the excluded number. This sum should be divisible by the excluded number. **Step 3: Generalizing the Process** We continue this process by always adding the sum of the current set. Consider a set of (k) numbers ( {a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k} } ) such that the sum of any (k-1) numbers is divisible by the remaining one. Define the sum of these (k) numbers as ( S_k = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k ). **Step 4: Constructing the Next Number** Extend the set to ({a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k}, S_k}). We verify that this new set satisfies the condition: - The sum of the (k+1) numbers is (S_k + S_k = 2S_k). - The sum of any (k) numbers from this set (excluding one number (a_i)) is (2S_k - a_i). By our initial assumption, (S_k) is divisible by each (a_i), thus (2S_k - a_i) is also divisible by (a_i). **Step 5: Building Up to 2005 Numbers** Starting with ({1, 2, 3}): [ {1, 2, 3} ] Calculate (S_3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6): [ {1, 2, 3, 6} ] Next, (S_4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12): [ {1, 2, 3, 6, 12} ] Continue this process: - (S_5 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 12 = 24) - (S_6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 = 48) - And so forth...

This means that the cost price (CP1) is such that 20% of CP1 is equal to the profit made on this article. So, we have: SP1 = CP1 + (20% of CP1) 120 = CP1 + (0.20 * CP1) 120 = CP1 * (1 + 0.20) 120 = CP1 * 1.20 CP1 = 120 / 1.20 CP1 = 100 For the second article: The selling price (SP2) is 150, and it was sold at a 25% profit. Similarly, we calculate the cost price (CP2). SP2 = CP2 + (25% of CP2) 150 = CP2 + (0.25 * CP2) 150 = CP2 * (1 + 0.25) 150 = CP2 * 1.25 CP2 = 150 / 1.25 CP2 = 120 For the third article: The selling price (SP3) is 200, and it was sold at a 10% profit.

Therefore, since m(x) > mleft(frac{1}{a+1}right), we conclude x_1 + x_2 > frac{2}{a+1}, thus proving the statement.

This means n can be expressed as n = 7m + 5 for some integer m. We need to find the smallest n that satisfies both conditions. To do this, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or simply test numbers that satisfy the first condition (odd numbers) to see if they also satisfy the second condition. Starting with the smallest odd number that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided by 7, which is 5 itself, we can test subsequent odd numbers that are 7 units apart (since we want the remainder to be 5 when divided by 7). So we test 5, 12, 19, 26, 33, 40, etc., until we find one that is also odd (which means it leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2). The first such number is 19 (since 19 % 2 = 1 and 19 % 7 = 5).

First, we notice that in the right triangle ABC, with AC as the hypotenuse, we have: cos alpha = frac{AB}{AC}. Similarly, in the right triangle ADE: cos beta = frac{AD}{AC}. And in the right triangle AEF: cos gamma = frac{AE}{AC}. Next, we use the fact that AC^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 + AE^2, which comes from the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. Substituting the values of cos alpha, cos beta, and cos gamma we get: AC^2 cos^2 alpha = AB^2, AC^2 cos^2 beta = AD^2, AC^2 cos^2 gamma = AE^2. Adding all these equations up, we get: AC^2 cos^2 alpha + AC^2 cos^2 beta + AC^2 cos^2 gamma = AB^2 + AD^2 + AE^2, which simplifies to: AC^2(cos^2 alpha + cos^2 beta + cos^2 gamma) = AC^2.

Here is a step-by-step solution: 1. **Rewrite the given equation**: [ 10x - 2xy - 2y + 1 = 0 ] 2. **Complete the square** to express the equation in standard form: Let's rewrite and rearrange the variables: [ 10x - 2xy - 2y + 1 = 0 ] Add and subtract necessary terms to complete the square: First, consider the quadratic form involving both ( x ) and ( y ): [ x^2 + 6x + y^2 - 6y - 2xy + 9 = x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 4y + 4 ] Upon simplifying, we get: [ x^2 - 4x + 4 + y^2 - 4y + 4 - 16 = 0 ] This reduces to the simplified distance form since: [ sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2} = |x - y + 3| ] 3. **Consider the distance ratio** form for the eccentricity of a conic section: For the given conic section, compare to the general conic section: [ frac{sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2}}{|x - y + 3|} = text{Constant} ] 4. **Evaluate the expression given**: Use the given identity for converting to the form of distance ratio: [ frac{sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2}}{frac{|x - y + 3|}{sqrt{2}}} = sqrt{2} ] Simplify to find the distance ratio: [ e = sqrt{2} ] This means the eccentricity ( e ) of the conic section represented by the equation ( 10x - 2xy - 2y + 1 = 0 ) is ( sqrt{2} ). # Conclusion: The eccentricity of the conic section is [boxed{sqrt{2}}]"},{"prompt":"Given that f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}. When x > 0, f(x) = x^2 4x. Represent the solution set of the inequality f(x) > x as an interval.","completion":"Since f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. For x > 0, we are given that f(x) = x^2 - 4x. Let us first find the solution to f(x) > x in this domain. f(x) > x x^2 - 4x > x x^2 - 5x > 0 x(x - 5) > 0 The roots of the quadratic are x=0 and x=5. From the inequality, we deduce that the solution set for x > 0 is (5, +infty), since the function is positive when x is outside of the roots and x > 0. Now, considering the values when x < 0, we use the fact that f(x) is an odd function: f(-x) > -x -f(x) > -x (since f(-x) = -f(x) for an odd function) f(x) < x We use the already defined expression of f(x) for positive x, but as f(x) is an odd function, for x < 0, the function reflects symmetrically with respect to the origin. Therefore, the solution for x < 0 must be symmetric to the solution for x > 0 with respect to the y-axis. Hence, the solution set for x < 0 is (-infty, -5). Combining both conditions, the solution set for the inequality f(x) > x represented as an interval is: (-infty, -5) cup (5, +infty) However, considering the domain specified by the original function (f(x) = x^2 - 4x for x > 0) and that f(x) is an odd function, the solution (-infty, -5) must be modified because for -x > 0, we have -f(x) = -(-x)^2 + 4(-x), which does not satisfy the inequality f(x) < x. So, we need to solve the inequality f(x) < x for x < 0 explicitly. Let us reflect the function for x < 0: f(x) = -(x^2 - 4x) = -x^2 + 4x Now we solve for f(x) < x: -x^2 + 4x < x -x^2 + 3x < 0 x(-x + 3) < 0 Analysis of this inequality gives us two roots, x = 0 and x = 3. As we are looking for the negative x values where the function is less than zero, this happens between the roots. Thus, the solution set for x < 0 is (-3, 0). Combining the solutions for x > 0 and x < 0, the complete solution set for the inequality f(x) > x is: boxed{(-3, 0) cup (5, +infty)}"},{"prompt":"A town is trying to clear litter from its streets.

The function f(x) will not have any extremum if its derivative f'(x) does not change sign, which means f'(x) geq 0 for all x. To ensure this, the discriminant of the quadratic derivative must be non-positive. Thus we have to ensure that the discriminant Delta associated with f'(x) is leq 0 for the parabola to remain above the x-axis at all times. The discriminant Delta of f'(x) is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac, where a = 3, b = 6a, and c = 3(a+2) for the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. After substituting the coefficients into the discriminant formula, we get Delta = (6a)^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot 3(a+2) = 36a^2 - 36(a+2). For f'(x) geq 0 to hold, the discriminant Delta must be leq 0. Hence, 36a^2 - 36(a+2) leq 0. Simplifying this, we get 36a^2 - 36a - 72 leq 0, a^2 - a - 2 leq 0. Factoring the quadratic, we find (a+1)(a-2) leq 0. The roots of this inequality are a_1 = -1 and a_2 = 2.
