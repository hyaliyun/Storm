Here's how you could do it: 1. Label the hormone slider: Give the slider a clear title, such as \\"Hormone Balance,\\" with a scale ranging from low to high or from more estrogen-driven traits to more testosterone-driven traits. 2. Physical appearance: Have the slider affect the character's physical features such as muscle mass, body hair, facial structure, and height. For example, at a lower hormone level (towards the estrogen-driven side), the character will have less muscle mass, smoother skin, shorter stature, and a more feminized facial structure. At a higher hormone level (towards the testosterone-driven side), the character will have more muscle mass, increased body hair, taller stature, and a more masculinized facial structure. 3. Voice pitch: The slider could also affect the character's voice pitch. A lower hormone level (more estrogen-driven) would result in a higher-pitched and more feminine voice, while a higher hormone level (more testosterone-driven) would result in a lower-pitched and more masculine voice. 4. Secondary sexual traits: The hormone slider could additionally influence secondary sexual traits, such as the presence of breasts and the body fat distribution (e.g., hips and thighs for estrogen-driven or upper body for testosterone-driven). 5. Bone structure: A more subtle effect could be the character's bone structure, such as broader shoulders or narrower hips at higher testosterone-driven levels and vice versa for the estrogen-driven side. Keep in mind to provide a diverse range of options along the slider spectrum, not limiting players to stereotypes but offering different combinations to create inclusive and diverse characters."},{"prompt":"How could this affect gameplay and story?","completion":"Incorporating hormone-driven changes via a slider in customizing character traits may affect gameplay and the story in various ways. By letting players influence their character's appearance, voice, and physical traits, the game world should organically respond to these choices. Here are a few ways this could happen: 1. NPC reactions: Throughout the game, non-player characters (NPCs) may react differently to the player's character depending on their hormone-driven traits. For example, NPCs might treat a character of higher muscle mass and height with more fear or respect, while a more slender and petite character might receive comments related to their agility or speed. 2. Potential romance options: The player's chosen hormone level might influence the relationship-building aspects of the game, changing the available romance options and the relationship dynamics between characters. 3. Job and quest opportunities: Some jobs or quests in the game might be more easily accessible to characters with specific hormone-driven traits, like more physically demanding activities for characters with higher muscle mass or activities that require a delicate touch for characters with a more slender build. 4. Skill development and stats: As the hormone slider determines certain physical characteristics, it could also affect the character's starting stats (strength, agility, endurance) and the way they develop their skills throughout the game. For example, a more testosterone-driven character might gain strength faster, while an estrogen-driven character could excel in agility or dexterity. 5. Clothing and armor: The game could offer unique armor and clothing designs to accommodate the character's hormone-driven traits. This would provide cosmetic variety and could possibly include functional differences, such as lighter armor for highly agile characters or heavier armor for bulkier characters. 6. Dialogue options: The game may include slightly altered dialogue choices or responses from NPCs based on the player's hormone-driven traits, which could lead to different story branches or outcomes in certain situations. 7. Reputation system: Depending on the character's hormone-driven traits, the player may gain a specific reputation in the game world, opening up or closing off certain opportunities, alliances, or even entire factions. These gameplay and story implications ensure that the player's choices in character customization extend beyond aesthetics, adding an extra layer of depth, strategy, and immersion to the game experience."},{"prompt":"How could Incorporate an in universe reason for a female being allowed to wear armour at all? Subtly though.","completion":"Incorporating an in-universe reason for a female character being allowed to wear armor can be done subtly by weaving it into the game's lore, culture, or history. Here are a few ideas on how to do this: 1. Legendary female figures: Include stories or legends of famous female warriors, knights, or leaders known for wearing armor in the game's lore. These historical figures could serve as a source of inspiration and act as role models for female characters in the game. 2. Culturally accepted: Make the game's fictional society more gender-neutral in terms of combat and warfare expectations. Present a culture where both men and women are expected to defend their lands and people and are therefore adequately trained and equipped to do so, including wearing armor. 3. Divine or spiritual reasons: Integrate a religious or spiritual belief in the game's world that supports women wearing armor. For example, the game's predominant religion could worship a goddess of war, protection, or justice who is often depicted wearing armor, thus suggesting that her female followers do the same. 4. Particular factions or orders: Create a specialized faction, guild, or order in the game's world that consists primarily of or is entirely open to female warriors. Wearing armor could be a symbol of their membership and their commitment to the goals and ideals of the organization. 5. Women's auxiliaries or military units: Establish the existence of all-female auxiliaries or military units in the army of a particular kingdom or region, making it an ordinary and recognizable sight for women to wear armor in specific circumstances. 6. Prominent female authority: Have a female ruler or general in the game's history or current story who supports gender equality and encourages women to participate in combat roles, resulting in greater acceptance of women wearing armor within the society. 7. Armor craftsmanship: Introduce talented female armorers who create highly sought-after armor designs that are tailored for women. Their presence in the game's world would imply that the demand and acceptance for female armor exist to some extent. By weaving these aspects into the game's setting, culture, and history, you can subtly and organically justify the presence of female characters in armor without making it seem out of place in the game's world."},{"prompt":"How could I subtly incorporate lore based on feminism without being too on the nose? related to the last input.","completion":"You can subtly incorporate feminist themes into your game's lore in various ways that promote gender equality and women's representation without being overly obvious. Here are some ideas: 1. Diverse representation of female characters: Create various female NPCs with distinct personalities, roles, and narratives throughout the game, ranging from political leaders to warriors, scholars, merchants, and farmers. 2. Gender-neutral leadership: Portray societies where both men and women can hold positions of power and influence, with examples of strong and competent leaders from both genders. 3. Positive folklore and mythology: Include myths, legends, and folklore that feature female protagonists who display bravery, wit, and resourcefulness. These stories can inspire characters within the game world to adopt more egalitarian values. 4. Female mentor figures: Incorporate female mentors or teachers who train and guide your player character and other protagonists throughout the game. They may offer advice, share combat expertise, or teach magic, demonstrating that women are just as capable and knowledgeable as men. 5. Equal opportunity organizations: Create guilds, factions, or societies that promote gender equality and offer equal representation of men and women in their ranks, accepting members regardless of their gender. 6. Subtle dialogue references: Incorporate subtle references to gender equality or female empowerment through ambient dialogues or conversations between NPCs. Overheard conversations can reveal bits of the game world's attitudes and values regarding gender without explicitly discussing feminism. 7. Exploration of gender roles: Use side quests or storylines to explore traditional gender roles and expectations within the game world and how they impact the lives of men and women. This can be an opportunity to question the norms and portray more progressive, equal-gender societies. 8. In-game literature or art: Add books, letters, paintings, or sculptures within the game world that celebrate the achievements and contributions of women, reflecting a society that values women's strengths and skills. Incorporating these subtle feminist themes into your game's lore, world-building, and narrative will create an immersive, thought-provoking experience for players without coming across as overly didactic."},{"prompt":"帮我写一段休产假的理由","completion":"尊敬的领导： 我很荣幸地在公司任职，并非常感谢公司给予我的机会和支持。因为我即将成为一名妈妈，我需要向公司申请休产假。 在怀孕期间，我一直积极地面对工作，但现在随着孩子的出生，我需要把重点放在家庭上，为了顺利地度过生产和照顾新生儿的少量初期时间，我需要请假。 我承认，公司是一个非常重要的组织，我的职责和工作需要得到有效的执行，但是我相信，比起一个健康稳定、快乐和成熟的家庭，这些都是次要的。 我想再次感谢公司提供给我这个机会，并对您的理解和支持表示感激。 谢谢。 此致， 敬礼！"},{"prompt":"帮我写一段休产假","completion":"尊敬的上级领导： 您好！ 我是贵公司的员工XXX。非常感谢公司一直以来的关心和支持。我很荣幸地告诉您，我已经怀孕了，预产期为XXXX年XX月XX日，我需要向公司申请休产假。 在过去的几个月里，我一直在积极的工作和学习中度过，但现在，我需要携带宝宝度过最初的几个月。作为新妈妈，我想将更多的时间投入到宝宝的抚养中，以确保宝宝的最佳成长和发展。同时，我也需要充分休息和恢复身体，为今后的工作做好准备。 我的建议是，从预产期开始，请公司为我安排产假，根据国家的相关政策，产假天数应为XX天。期间，我将不参与公司工作，以便更好地调整生活和照顾宝宝。 特别的，在产假结束后，我将继续享受XX天陪产假期，以陪伴孩子和家人，同时为回归工作做好准备。 最后，我再次感谢公司的关心和支持，希望工作和生活都可以更加美好。谢谢！ 此致 敬礼！ XXX"},{"prompt":"1.每组值日生将托盘端到本组，幼儿根据需求自主饮水。 2.配班教师关注幼儿如厕、洗手情况，保育员则根据幼儿所需适时增减水壶内水量。 特别关注应该怎么写","completion":"特别关注： 1. 在饮水过程中，值日生应确保幼儿自主饮水的安全，避免烫伤、溺水等意外发生。 2. 教师和保育员要密切观察幼儿的饮水需求，确保他们摄取充足的水分，特别是在炎热的天气里要注意防止脱水。 3. 对于有特殊需求或患有疾病的幼儿，要事先了解其对水的需求和饮水禁忌，提供适当的关照和照顾。 4. 在幼儿如厕和洗手过程中，要关注幼儿的卫生习惯，引导他们养成良好的卫生习惯，同时防止传染病的发生。 5. 保育员要定期清洗和消毒水壶，确保水质的安全和卫生。 6. 在饮水过程中，教师要注重培养幼儿自我保护意识，如不随意借用他人水壶，不乱扔水杯等。"},{"prompt":"Resenhe a filosofia de Platão através da filosofia de Buda.","completion":"Não é fácil estabelecer uma resenha comparando diretamente a filosofia de Platão com a filosofia de Buda, pois ambas possuem raízes, conceitos e objetivos diferentes. Contudo, podemos apontar algumas contrastes notáveis entre as duas. Enquanto a filosofia de Platão é baseada na lógica e na razão, buscando a verdade através de uma busca pelo conhecimento intelectual, a filosofia de Buda é mais voltada para a sabedoria prática e a contemplação interior para encontrar a verdade sobre a natureza da existência humana. Além disso, a filosofia de Platão enfatiza a importância das ideias e formas universais, acreditando que o mundo físico é apenas um reflexo imperfeito do mundo das ideias. Já Buda enfatiza a natureza interdependente de todos os fenômenos e como a eterna mudança da realidade é inevitável. Enquanto Platão colocava grande ênfase na educação e no desenvolvimento intelectual como forma de alcançar a verdade e a perfeição, Buda destacava a importância de seguir o caminho do meio e encontrar o equilíbrio entre os opostos para alcançar o nirvana. Em resumo, enquanto a filosofia de Platão tende a ser mais teórica e racional, a filosofia de Buda é mais empiricamente fundada na sabedoria prática internalizada."},{"prompt":"Simule o que Buda ponderaria sobre a filosofia de Platão.","completion":"Se Buda fosse avaliar a filosofia de Platão, ele provavelmente apontaria algumas questões em sua abordagem para buscar a verdade e a perfeição. Buda acreditava que a verdade só pode ser encontrada através da auto-reflexão e do autoconhecimento, ao invés de se basear somente na lógica e no raciocínio. Para ele, é necessário experienciar a verdade de uma maneira direta e pessoal, através de uma contemplação interior. Portanto, Buda poderia argumentar que a abordagem de Platão é muito limitada, pois depende unicamente da razão e do aprendizado intelectual. Além disso, Buda destacava a importância de reconhecer que tudo está em constante mudança e que precisa ser aceito e valorizado em sua imperfeição. Nesse sentido, a concepção platônica de um mundo perfeito e ideal, no qual o mundo real é meramente uma cópia imperfeita, seria problemática para Buda. Por outro lado, Buda provavelmente veria valor na ideia platônica de buscar aperfeiçoamento e evolução pessoal através da educação e da filosofia. Afinal, para Buda, o caminho do meio para alcançar a sabedoria e o equilíbrio envolve o desenvolvimento pessoal e o auto-aperfeiçoamento. Em resumo, enquanto Buda poderia questionar alguns aspectos da abordagem platônica para buscar a verdade, ele provavelmente reconheceria a importância da busca pela sabedoria e pela evolução pessoal."},{"prompt":"雅诗兰黛胶原水含酒精吗","completion":"雅诗兰黛胶原水不含酒精。该产品主要成分是胶原蛋白、甘油、海藻提取物等，不含酒精。"},{"prompt":"假设我现在的循环体有100万条数据，要根据一个参数值去循环查询数据表该值是否存在；该参数值在数据表中建立了二级b+树索引。 像这样的话这个循环体的耗时时间大概是多少","completion":"无法准确确定时间，因为具体耗时取决于很多因素，例如数据表的大小、硬件性能、索引的结构等等。不过有二级B+树索引的话，随着数据量的增加，查询速度应该是可以保持稳定。建议使用分页查询或其他优化技巧来提高效率。"},{"prompt":"不需要准确确定，大概时间就行","completion":"根据常见的情况来估计，如果每次查询耗时1毫秒，一百万次的循环体需要1000秒（约16.7分钟）才能完成。但是，如果系统配置较好并且查询优化得当，查询速度可能会更快，所需的时间也将更短。"},{"prompt":"最短的话大概是多少","completion":"最短的时间无法确定，因为涉及到的因素很多，包括但不限于：硬件性能、网络延迟、查询优化、数据表大小、数据分布情况等等。如果系统配置和查询优化得当，查询速度较快，那么可能少于1毫秒甚至更短。但是如果出现任何问题，查询时间都可能大大延长。"},{"prompt":"goodsMoq = (int) Math.ceil(0.23); 为什么是1的结果，不是0的结果吗","completion":"这是因为\`Math.ceil(x)\`是向上取整的函数，它返回一个大于或等于参数x的最小整数值（值得注意的是，返回值类型为double）。在这个例子中，0.23向上取整后得到1，再将这个结果强制转换为int类型得到1。如果要得到0的结果，可以将0.23改成一个更小的值，例如0.01。"},{"prompt":"怎么在git中拉去代码","completion":"1. 首先打开命令行或终端窗口 2. 使用cd命令进入要存放代码的文件夹，如cd /Users/username/project/ 3. 执行git clone命令，如git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git （其中repo为要拉取的代码仓库名称，github.com/username为仓库的地址） 4. 如果需要在拉取代码的时候输入用户名和密码，请输入对应的信息 5. 等待代码克隆完成，即可在本地文件夹中看到代码的副本。"},{"prompt":"It’s a beautiful spring day in Los Angeles one of Mishaali's final days at the beach from her long extensive vacay and today is different cause today she have a match with her long time Spanish rival, Melissa Jerez","completion":"As Mishaali prepares for her beach day with a mix of excitement and anticipation, she gathers all her essentials - her beach towel, sunscreen, a bottle of water, and her favorite swimsuit.

\\"box\\" 的通用类和一个名为 \\"blue\\" 的特定类，其中 \\"blue\\" 在 \\"box\\" 中设置样式，则可以在 \\"blue\\" 类选择器中进行覆盖。例如，在下面的代码中，\\"blue\\" 类选择器将覆盖设置在 \\"box\\" 中的背景颜色： \`\`\` .box { background-color: white; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; } .blue { background-color: blue; } \`\`\` 2. 使用!important关键字覆盖其他样式 可以用 '!important' 关键字强制指定特定样式。例如： \`\`\` .box { background-color: white !important; border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; } \`\`\` 在上面的示例中，\\"background-color\\" 样式被标记为 \\"important\\"，其优先级比其他样式更高，并将覆盖所有其他样式（除了拥有同样!important的样式）。 请注意，重复使用 !important 可能会导致样式无法优化，并可能造成维护麻烦。因此建议只在必要时使用!important。"},{"prompt":"如何自定义修改Element组件的css样式","completion":"在 React 中，Element组件通常是由多个子组件组成的复杂组件。如果您想自定义 Element 组件的 CSS 样式，可以采取以下两种方法之一： 1. 使用组件的className prop Element组件通常会将 \\"className\\" 属性传递给子组件，以便子组件可以继承父组件的样式。因此，您可以使用 \\"className\\" 属性来修改 Element 组件的样式。 例如： \`\`\` <Element className=\\"my-custom-style\\"> <ChildComponent /> <AnotherChildComponent /> </Element> \`\`\` 在上面的示例中，我们为 \\"Element\\" 组件添加了一个名为 \\"my-custom-style\\" 的自定义类。 然后，您可以使用 CSS 来定义 \\"my-custom-style\\" 类的样式： \`\`\` .my-custom-style { background-color: red; color: white; } \`\`\` 在上面的示例中，我们将设置 Element 组件的背景颜色为红色，文本颜色为白色。 2. 修改组件的默认样式 如果您想更彻底地修改元素组件的样式，您可以通过在样式表中使用元素组件的默认 CSS 类名来完成。这样做将会全局应用该样式，直接影响所有使用该组件的页面或组件。 例如，假设 Element 组件的默认 CSS 类名为 \\"element\\"，我们可以像这样修改它的样式： \`\`\` .element { background-color: red; color: white; padding: 10px; } \`\`\` 在上面的示例中，我们重新定义了 Element 组件的默认 CSS 样式，并将其背景改为红色，文本颜色改为白色，以及添加了10像素的内边距。"},{"prompt":"css如何让div靠右","completion":"要将 \`div\` 元素靠右对齐，您可以使用 CSS 中的 \`float\` 属性和 \`text-align\` 属性。 1. \`float\` 属性 使用 \`float\` 属性可以浮动元素并将它们悬停在屏幕上的特定位置。 例如，要将 \`div\` 元素与其他元素并排且靠右对齐，您可以将其 \`float\` 设置为 \`\\"right\\"\`: \`\`\` <div style=\\"float: right;\\"> Your content here </div> \`\`\` 在上面的示例中，\`div\` 元素将与其后面的元素并排，位置靠右。 2. \`text-align\`属性 如果您想将所有内容（包括 \`div\` 元素）对齐到页面的右侧，可以使用 \`text-align\` 属性。 例如，如果您希望一个 \`div\` 元素对齐到页面的右侧，您可以将其父元素的 \`text-align\` 设置为 \`\\"right\\"\`: \`\`\` <div style=\\"text-align: right;\\"> <div>Your content here</div> <div>Your other content here</div> </div> \`\`\` 在上面的示例中，\`div\` 元素被包含在另一个 \`div\` 中，其

北京时间2023年5月19日上午8点45分出生的刘姓女孩，农历4月1日。首先，我们需要了解到这个时间点的八字五行排盘情况，即出生时间的天干地支所对应的五行。 出生八字为：壬寅、丙辰、戊戌、己酉。五行属性分别为：水、木；火、土；土、土；土、金。 其中，壬寅的组合为水木，具有生生之势；丙辰的组合为火土，五行相克；戊戌和己酉都属于双土金组合，五行相生。 综合这个女孩的五行属性，我们可以得知水木为旺盛，土金为克削火，需要在命运中补充火的属性以平衡生活中的运势。 根据这个女孩的五行八卦情况，我们可以结合己有的姓氏“刘”，选择一个含有火属性、既能够保持生生之势，又能够补充火为主题的名字。 如“刘熙萌”中的“熙”字表示世间万物光彩生辉，代表火属性；“萌”字表示新生、蓬勃，象征木属性。这个名字不仅寓意着美好的愿景，而且通过名字的五行构成达到平衡五行的作用。在此基础上，也可以考虑音韵和字义方面的搭配，使名字寓意更加美好。 当然，五行八卦只是姓名学中的一个方面，实际上名字的选择更多地取决于个人喜好和名字的寓意、音韵等因素。希望对这个女孩起名有所帮助。"},{"prompt":"你好","completion":"你好！有什么我可以帮助您的吗？"},{"prompt":"请问你是chatgpt4.0吗？","completion":"我是OpenAI的GPT-3模型，而不是GPT-4.0。如果您有任何问题或需要帮助，请随时向我提问！"},{"prompt":"my

Ethernet cable: You can use a crossover cable or an Ethernet cable to directly connect two computers. When you do this, you'll need to manually assign the IP addresses on both computers. After both computers have been assigned IP addresses, you can share files by moving them to an accessible folder on each computer. 2. USB data transfer cable: You can connect two computers using a USB data transfer cable designed to allow two computers to share files. These cables have a special chip inside that allows two computers to communicate and transfer data, similar to a network connection. 3. Homegroup (Windows): If you're using Windows 7 or later, you can create a homegroup to connect two computers and share files. A homegroup is a group of PCs on a home network that can share files and printers. To create a homegroup, open the HomeGroup control panel, and follow the prompts to create a new homegroup. Then, join your second computer to the homegroup by navigating to the HomeGroup control panel and entering the homegroup password. 4. Network-attached storage (NAS): A NAS is a dedicated storage device that can be connected to your network, allowing multiple computers to access and share files. You can purchase a NAS device or build your own using an old computer or a Raspberry Pi. Once the NAS is set up, you can access it just like any other network device, allowing you to easily share files between your two computers. 5. Cloud storage: Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive allow you to store files in the cloud, making it easy to access and share files between multiple devices. To share files between two computers, you can upload a file to one of these services on one computer, and then log in to the same service on the other computer to download the file. 6. File transfer protocol (FTP): Another option for sharing files between two computers is to use an FTP client like FileZilla. This requires setting up an FTP server on one of the computers and securely transferring files between the two. Keep in mind that each method has its advantages and disadvantages, so you'll want to choose the method that best meets your needs in terms of convenience, security, and ease of use."},{"prompt":"你好","completion":"你好！有什么问题我可以帮助您解答吗？"},{"prompt":"I’m building a video game engine using C++ as the coding language and Vulkan for graphics.

His father was a high-ranking member of the KGB, and his mother was a loving housewife who often entertained guests from the Communist Party. From a young age, Nikitin learned the importance of loyalty and secrecy. He excelled in school, particularly in his studies of Russian history and political theory, and showed an early interest in military strategy. After graduating from Moscow State University with degrees in political science and military studies, Nikitin joined the Soviet Army. He quickly distinguished himself as a gifted intelligence officer, with a talent for extracting valuable information from prisoners. Nikitin had a natural gift for languages, which made him particularly effective in querying American prisoners-of-war. In 1985, Nikitin was assigned to the newly-formed Aggressor Target Reconnaissance Unit (ATRU), a top-secret intelligence agency tasked with gathering and analyzing information about the enemy and the mission objectives. A true patriot, Nikitin was eager to serve his country and do whatever it took to ensure the Soviet Union's continued dominance. At ATRU, Nikitin worked tirelessly to uncover information about the American military and their strategies. He used his considerable interrogation skills to extract information from captured soldiers, aided by his fluency in English and American cultural references. Nikitin was always respectful but firm, using a combination of charm and psychological manipulation to get prisoners to lower their guard and reveal crucial details. Despite the stress and danger of his work, Nikitin remained dedicated to his goals. He never lost sight of the greater good of the Soviet Union, and was committed to doing whatever was necessary to protect his country and its interests. His devotion to duty earned him the respect of his superiors and colleagues, who recognized his skill and dedication. As the Cold War raged on, Nikitin remained a vital asset to the Soviet military. His abilities as an intelligence officer played a key role in several pivotal missions, and his insights helped shape Soviet strategy for years to come.

Он описывал жизнь и прекрасных женщин своего времени, и одним из основных образов в его работах были \\"ню\\" - изображения голых женщин. Несмотря на то, что образы \\"ню\\" в многих культурах ассоциировались с эксплуатацией женщин, работы Мане можно рассматривать с точки зрения искусства и возможности показать красоту женского тела. Одной из самых известных работ Мане с ню является картина \\"Завтрак на траве\\", на которой изображены голые женщины в окружении мужчин. Эта работа вызывала большой скандал в то время, но теперь стала символом импрессионизма. На картинах Мане ню не всегда изображаются полностью голыми, их фигуры скрыты за условными деталями одежды или толстыми роскошными тканями. Однако стоит отметить, что некоторые из работ Мане с ню вызывают критику с точки зрения женской эмансипации. Например, картина \\"Женщина на водопаде\\" изображает голую женщину в качестве объекта мужского взгляда и рассматривается как пример сексуализации женского тела. Таким образом, работы Эдуарда Мане с ню можно рассматривать как разнообразные взгляды на красоту женского тела. В некоторых из них он изображал женское тело как объект красоты, а в других - как сексуальный объект для мужского взгляда. Вместе с тем, работы Мане являются важным элементом истории искусства и красоты в нашей культуре."},{"prompt":"Напиши анализ картины Эдуарда Мане \\"Олимпия\\"","completion":"\\"Олимпия\\" - это знаменитая картина французского художника Эдуарда Мане, написанная в 1863 году. Эта работа породила сильную реакцию общественности своего времени, считается одним из ключевых произведений мировой живописи и является иконой импрессионизма. На картинах Мане часто изображались женщины, и \\"Олимпия\\" - не исключение. В картинах маньеримо изображенная нагая женщина представляет собой портрет героини, неназванной парижанки низкого происхождения, которую моделью называли Викторин Мо. Общественность сильно возмутилась наготой \\"Олимпии\\" и намеком на ее профессию, а также на присутствие слуги с цветами в левом углу картины. Изобразительный язык Мане в \\"Олимпии\\" связан с идеалами романтизма и имеет знакомые элементы классической живописи. Форма \\"Олимпии\\" гармонична и красива, но ее силуэт противоречит традиционным идеалам красоты того времени и выделяет ее из канона фигур, которые обычно портретировались как \\"красивые\\". Мане применяет особую технику в \\"Олимпии\\", нарочито добавляя темные цвета (черный, коричневый) к образу Олимпии, что добавляет пикантности и некоторой загадочности к ее образу. Таким образом, картина \\"Олимпия\\" Эдуарда Мане является произведением сильного и конфронтационного характера, которое до сих пор остается объектом множества дискуссий и анализов в мировой живописи.

The term \\"quantum\\" comes from the Latin word \\"quantus\\" meaning \\"how much,\\" and in the context of quantum mechanics, it refers to discrete, indivisible units of energy called quanta. Here are some essential concepts and features of quantum mechanics: 1. Wave-particle duality: The theory explains that particles, like electrons and photons, can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This means that these particles can sometimes act as waves and other times as particles. 2. The uncertainty principle: Proposed by Werner Heisenberg, this principle states that it is impossible to precisely measure certain pairs of properties (such as position and momentum) of a particle at the same time. The more accurately we measure one, the less accurately we can measure the other. 3. Superposition: In quantum mechanics, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously called superposition. This means that a particle can be in multiple positions, have multiple energies, or have different momenta all at the same time. However, once we make a measurement, the particle collapses into one definite state. 4. Quantum entanglement: This phenomenon refers to the strong correlation between two or more particles, such that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. When one entangled particle is measured, it instantly affects the state of the other entangled particle, seemingly surpassing the speed of light. This phenomenon has been referred to as \\"spooky action at a distance\\" by Albert Einstein. 5. Quantum tunneling: This effect allows particles to pass through energy barriers that classical physics would deem impossible. For example, an electron can \\"tunnel\\" through a barrier in a process that is critical to the functioning of many electronic devices, including transistors. Quantum mechanics has broad applications in various fields, such as chemistry, biology, and materials science. It is also the foundation for advanced technologies like quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensors. The principles of quantum mechanics, although counterintuitive and challenging to comprehend, have significantly improved our understanding of the natural world at the smallest scales."},{"prompt":"if i want to have ai like you to run on a computer then what is the specification of a computer that i have to use?","completion":"To run AI systems like me, you don't necessarily need a high-spec computer, as my functionalities are primarily cloud-based, which means most of the heavy computation is done on powerful servers, not your local machine. However, to interact with me smoothly and ensure optimal performance, you should have a basic computer with a stable internet connection. For running AI on a local machine or personal computer, the specifications would depend on the complexity and computational requirements of the AI model you want to run. For simple AI tasks and small models, a standard computer with the following specifications should suffice: - Processor: At least a modern quad-core processor, such as Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5. - RAM: 8 GB or more - Storage: 256 GB or more of SSD storage for better performance - Graphics Card: Integrated graphics can handle most simple AI tasks, but for training and running larger models, a dedicated GPU like NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 or better is recommended. For more advanced AI tasks, such as deep learning, training large neural networks, or handling significant amounts of data, the recommended specifications for your local machine would be: - Processor: High-performance multicore processor, such as Intel Core i9 or AMD Ryzen 9. - RAM: 16 GB or more, preferably 32 GB for handling large datasets - Storage: 1 TB or more of SSD storage, for fast read and write operations - Graphics Card: High-performance dedicated GPU, such as NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 series or NVIDIA A100, with Tensor cores (useful for AI and deep learning tasks) Note that running complex AI models locally will increase your hardware requirements, and you may need more powerful GPUs or even specialized hardware like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for large-scale machine learning or deep learning projects.

Одним из важных аспектов при создании такого сада является наличие растений, которые привлекают полезных насекомых. В данной статье мы рассмотрим несколько видов растений, которые способствуют увеличению численности полезных насекомых в саду. Первым растением, которое может привлечь полезных насекомых – это цветок календула. Он не только отлично выглядит на клумбе, но и является медоносной культурой, которая привлекает множество пчел и других насекомых. Календула считается одним из наиболее эффективных растений для привлечения насекомых и защиты растений от вредителей. Еще одним растением, которое может привлечь полезных насекомых, является белокрыльник. Он привлекает бабочек и других насекомых, которые могут полинизировать другие растения, а также является пищевым и убежищным источником для многих насекомых-хищников, которые могут уничтожать вредителей растений. Ромашка – это еще один цветок, который может привлечь полезных насекомых, особенно пчел. Во время цветения ромашки, можно заметить, как пчелы активно посещают этот цветок в поисках пыльцы и нектара. Кроме того, ромашка имеет противовоспалительное и успокаивающее действие, поэтому ее можно использовать не только для создания красивых клумб, но и для лечения различных заболеваний. Также стоит упомянуть о розмарине, который является корень отличным местом для гнездования многих насекомых-хищников, которые могут уничтожать вредителей растений.

While elohim may be used to describe multiple deities, OT authors usually use the term to refer to the singular God of Israel (more than 2,000 instances), such as here. Likely the term was a title for the true God but is used so frequently that it becomes viewed as a name. The narrative begins with a statement assuming the Existence of the Deity. It is not a matter for discussion, argument, or doubt. The Israelite Cosmogony differs in this respect from that of the Babylonians, Phoenicians, Egyptians, &c. The Cosmogonies of the ancients were wont to be preceded by Theogonies. The existence and nativities of the creating divinities were accounted for in mythologies which were often highly complicated, and not seldom grotesque. The Hebrew narrator, by beginning with the Creation, emphasizes his entire freedom from, and exclusion of, polytheistic thought. “God” is infinite; He was before all time. Upon the subject of the Divine Existence prior to the beginning, the writer does not presume to speculate. That Israelite imagination did not wholly avoid the subject, we know from Job 38:4-7, Proverbs 8:22-30, Sirach 24:9. Concerning the Israelite conception of God (Elohim), we learn (1) from the present verse, that He (i) is a Person, and (ii) exists from all eternity; (2) from the whole passage, Genesis 1:1 to Genesis 2:4a, that He is (i) supreme in power, and (ii) perfect in wisdom and goodness. The attribute of power is shewn in creative omnipotence; that of wisdom in the orderly sequence of creation; that of goodness in the benevolent purpose which directed its successive phases.","completion":"Note on \\"God\\" (Genesis 1:1) The term \\"Elohim\\" is used in the Hebrew text for \\"God\\" in Genesis 1:1. While Elohim is a plural term, it is primarily employed by the Old Testament authors to denote the singular God of Israel in more than 2,000 instances, including this verse. It seems likely that the term served as a title for the true God but was used so often that it came to be misconstrued as a proper name. Distinct from other ancient Cosmogonies that often focused on Theogonies with complex and sometimes grotesque mythologies, the narrative of Genesis begins by presuming the existence of the Deity without any argument, discussion, or doubt. The Israelites saw \\"God\\" as infinite and pre-existing before all time, avoiding speculative ideas about the Divine Existence prior to the Creation (as seen in Job 38:4-7, Proverbs 8:22-30, Sirach 24:9). From the Genesis creation account, we gather that the Israelites perceived God (Elohim) as (1) a person who exists eternally, (2) supremely powerful, and (3) perfect in wisdom and goodness. Creative omnipotence displays God's power, the orderly arrangement of creation reflects His wisdom, and the benevolent intentions behind the process of creation signify His goodness."},{"prompt":"在详细阅读[文案创作完全手册]这本书的内容后，再结合自身对广告文案的理解，撰写一篇你对广告文案思考的文章。","completion":"广告文案是广告传播的核心，既能唤起消费者购买欲望，又能推动产品销售，是广告创意宣传的关键因素。基于自己对广告文案的了解和对《文案创作完全手册》的详细阅读，我认为广告文案需要从以下几个方面进行思考： 首先，广告文案不仅要有创意，还要与产品特点相符。广告文案要充分考虑产品本身的特点、消费者的需求、差异化竞争等多个方面，以此为基础进行文案创作。切忌只是注重创意而忽视产品本身，否则会失去广告的主要功效。 其次，广告文案要形成情感共鸣。情感共鸣是广告传播成功的重要诉求之一，让受众在看到广告时感受到自己的需求和想法得以理解和表达。要做到这一点，广告文案需要挖掘深入人心的情感和价值。只有切实联系到受众的心理需求，才能产生强烈的共鸣和共情，达到最终的广告传播效果。 然后，广告文案需要有独特的视角和表达方式。在广告文案创作中，独特的视角和表达方式往往是最能吸引受众的部分。例如采用俏皮幽默或者悬疑诱惑等方式，更有助于引起受众的兴趣。同时，广告文案的表达方式也应该符合品牌的定位、文化内涵等方面，在保持独特性的同时增强品牌的认知度和知名度。 最后，广告文案要简洁明了、易传播。广告文案是要为更多的消费者所认可和了解，因此要注意文案的可传达性和易传播性。朴实无华、寥寥数字、极简风格等都是常用的文案写作风格，能够使文案的传达效果更加明确和强烈。 总之，广告文案作为广告宣传的核心元素，需要从多个方面进行思考和优化。只有根据产品特点、消费者需求等来进行文案创作，才能有效地唤起消费者购买欲望，推动产品销售，让品牌得到更好的传播。"},{"prompt":"现在有以下sql语句： SELECT BITMAP_AND(t1.nascent_id, t2.nascent_id) as vars FROM ( select 1 as code, sub_bitmap(crowd_bitmap, 0, 100000) as nascent_id from app_common_crowd_snap) t1 INNER JOIN ( SELECT 1 AS code, (BITMAP_UNION(to_bitmap(SR.nascent_id))) AS nascent_id FROM dwd_member_shop_rt SR WHERE SR.bind_mobile IS NOT NULL AND SR.bind_mobile != ‘’ ) t2 ON t1.code = t2.code 要求：我想要在查询结果中vars后面继续查询t2表的bing_mobile，请帮我修改sql","completion":"以下是修改后的SQL语句： SELECT vars, t2.bind_mobile FROM ( SELECT BITMAP_AND(t1.nascent_id, t2.nascent_id) AS vars FROM ( SELECT 1 AS code, sub_bitmap(crowd_bitmap, 0, 100000) AS nascent_id FROM app_common_crowd_snap ) t1 INNER JOIN ( SELECT 1 AS code, BITMAP_UNION(to_bitmap(SR.nascent_id)) AS nascent_id, SR.bind_mobile FROM dwd_member_shop_rt SR WHERE SR.bind_mobile IS NOT NULL AND SR.bind_mobile != '' ) t2 ON t1.code = t2.code ) t3;

Oxidative depolymerization is frequently applied to lignin to generate phenolic monomers. However, due to the instability of phenolic intermediates, repolymerization and dearylation reactions lead to low selectivity and product yields. Here, a highly efficient strategy to extract the aromatic monomers from lignin affording functionalized diaryl ethers using oxidative cross-coupling reactions is described, which overcomes the limitations of oxidative methods and affords high-value specialty chemicals. Reaction of phenylboronic acids with lignin converts the reactive phenolic intermediates into stable diaryl ether products in near-theoretical maximum yields (92% for beech lignin and 95% for poplar lignin based on the content of β−O−4 linkages). This strategy suppresses side reactions typically encountered in oxidative depolymerization reactions of lignin and provides a new approach for the direct transformation of lignin into valuable functionalized diaryl ethers, including key intermediates in pharmaceutical and natural product synthesis. Introduction Among the plentiful biomass, lignin is the only sustainable source of aromatic compounds1,2,3,4,5,6 and is available in abundant quantities as a waste product from the pulp and paper and bioethanol industries6. Nonetheless, lignin is under-exploited as a renewable chemical feedstock due to the limited number of efficient and selective downstream processing strategies available. Various methods have been extensively studied for the conversion of lignin into aromatic products that can broadly be classified as catalytic oxidative degradation, catalytic reductive degradation and acid/base-catalyzed degradation2,3,4,6. Catalytic oxidative degradation has a number of advantages compared to other catalytic fractionation methods including hydrogenolysis (a reductive process), and acid/base-catalyzed degradation4,7,8. Catalytic oxidative degradation advantageously take place under mild and environmentally benign conditions, which contrasts with hydrogenolysis that uses noble metal catalysts, high reaction temperatures and pressures, or the use of corrosive acid/base-catalyzed degradation reagents. In addition, catalytic oxidative degradation has the potential to retain key functionality in the products that could be relevant in subsequent synthetic steps9,10,11. Many homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic oxidative methods that cleave the C–C bonds of the alkyl side chains to depolymerize lignin have been reported, but typically they are limited by poor selectivity and consequently low product yields (Fig. 1)12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. The catalysts reported for the oxidative fragmentation of lignin are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.The critical issue that must be solved to overcome the aforementioned limitations is that the phenolic hydroxy group is unstable under oxidative conditions24, leading to side reactions including repolymerization and ring opening reactions, which generates complex polymers, oligomers, and non-aromatic side products25,26,27,28. Hence, aromatic products are isolated in low yields in certain direct oxidative degradation reactions.","completion":"The article focuses on the efficient valorization of lignin, a sustainable source of functionalized aromatic products, which can reduce dependence on fossil-derived feedstocks. The oxidative depolymerization method is commonly used to extract phenolic monomers from lignin, but its instability leads to low selectivity and yields due to side reactions such as repolymerization and dearylation. Therefore, a highly efficient strategy using oxidative cross-coupling reactions to extract aromatic monomers from lignin is proposed, which overcomes the limitations of oxidative methods. In this approach, phenylboronic acids are reacted with lignin, which converts the reactive phenolic intermediates into stable diaryl ether products in near-theoretical maximum yields. The strategy suppresses typical side reactions and provides a new approach for direct transformation of lignin into valuable functionalized diaryl ethers, key intermediates in pharmaceutical and natural product synthesis. The article highlights the advantages of catalytic oxidative degradation over other methods such as catalytic reductive degradation and acid/base-catalyzed degradation. The former requires mild and environmentally benign conditions, retains key functionality in the products, and has the potential to generate useful synthetic steps. However, despite many homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic oxidative methods reported for lignin depolymerization, poor selectivity and low yields remain an issue due to phenolic hydroxy group instability under oxidative conditions that generates complex polymers. Therefore, the proposed strategy offers a viable solution to the limitations of oxidative depolymerization of lignin. In summary, the study provides insights into the potential of lignin as a sustainable source of valuable aromatic products and a promising alternative to fossil-derived feedstocks."},{"prompt":"\\"#Certainly, here is an upgraded version of the Python program with logging and status recording: import os import zipfile import glob import smtplib from email.message import EmailMessage import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET import logging logging.basicConfig(filename='status_log.txt', level=logging.INFO) fsd_list = [ [\\"aaa\\", \\"aaa@email.com\\"], [\\"bbb\\", \\"bbb@email.com\\"], [\\"ccc\\", \\"ccc@email.com\\"], ] # Function to unzip all files in ./unzip folder def unzip_all_files(): os.makedirs('./unzipped', exist_ok=True) zip_files = glob.glob('./unzip/.zip') for zip_file in zip_files: with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file, 'r') as zfile: zfile.extractall('./unzipped') logging.info(f'{zip_file} unzipped') if not zip_files: logging.error('No ZIP files found in \\"./unzip\\" directory') return # Function to find FSD in an XML file def find_fsd(xml_file): tree = ET.parse(xml_file) root = tree.getroot() fsd_element = root.find('.//fsd') if fsd_element is not None: return fsd_element.text return None # Function to send email with a PDF file attached def send_email(fsd_email, pdf_file): email_address = 'your_email@gmail.com' email_password = 'your_gmail_app_password' msg = EmailMessage() msg['Subject'] = 'FSD PDF file' msg['From'] = email_address msg['To'] = fsd_email msg.set_content('Please find the PDF file attached.') with open(pdf_file, 'rb') as pdf: msg.add_attachment(pdf.read(), maintype='application', subtype='pdf', filename=pdf_file) with smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465) as smtp: smtp.login(email_address, email_password) smtp.send_message(msg) logging.info(f'{pdf_file} sent to {fsd_email}') #Now, let's define the main function that will perform the required tasks including unzipping .zip files, finding FSD in .xml files, and sending emails with .pdf files attached: def main(): unzip_all_files() unzipped_folders = os.listdir('./unzipped') for folder in unzipped_folders: xml_file = glob.glob(f'./unzipped/{folder}/.xml')[0] fsd_in_xml = find_fsd(xml_file) if fsd_in_xml: for fsd, fsd_email in fsd_list: # If FSD in the XML file matches the one in the list, send the email with the PDF attached if fsd == fsd_in_xml: pdf_file = glob.glob(f'./unzipped/{folder}/*.pdf')[0] send_email(fsd_email, pdf_file) status = 'Success' break else: status = 'FSD not found in list' else: status = 'FSD not found in XML' logging.info(f'{folder}: {status}') if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main()\\" can you help me upgrade the code that it provide day time in each log message","completion":"Certainly!

Use evidence from your reflective journal and the relevant literature to support this discussion. Prior to beginning the unit EUN656 (Leadership Identity), my view of leadership was limited to the notion that it is any role from the organizational structure within my institution and it was a formally assigned role by the administrators that have supervisory and management roles. I was tasked to be the head of the Management Information Systems (MIS) Team for a year. The MIS Team is primarily composed of people who are much older than me and holds much higher teaching positions than me. I consider myself to be a purpose-driven servant leader who believed that if I could efficiently carry out my duties and responsibilities for the MIS team on a day-to-day basis, I would be an effective teacher leader for the team. Moreover, I consider myself to be an introverted teacher leader, thus, I thought that it limited me to become an effective teacher leader due to my shyness and awkwardness to socially interact with my team members, especially that I am the youngest person in the team and I am the lowest in terms of position and years of service in my institution.

Leadership identity is a complex and multifaceted concept that encompasses various perspectives and theories (Samier & Milley, 2020). As an introverted leader, my understanding of leadership and leadership identity has evolved significantly throughout my experience in a postgraduate unit on Leadership Identity (EUN656). This reflexive essay will present a critical analysis of the changes in my understanding of leadership identity and leadership identity construction. The essay will begin by outlining my initial understanding of leadership and discuss one key point of cognitive dissonance regarding introversion in leadership. It will then analyze three critical aspects where my understanding of leadership has evolved, culminating in a reflexive statement on my leadership identity construction and its implications for my leadership practice and identity. Initial Understanding of Leadership and Leadership Identity My initial understanding of leadership was influenced by my experience as the head of the Management Information Systems (MIS) Team at my institution. I believed that leadership was exclusively tied to an organizational structure and was limited to formally assigned roles and responsibilities (Grint, 2011). My leadership style was characterized by an emphasis on efficiency and daily performance, and I viewed my introversion as a potential weakness in my ability to effectively collaborate with my team members, particularly given their higher-ranking positions and more extensive experience in my institution (Briggs, 2007). This narrow perspective on leadership and leadership identity was challenged during my time in the EUN656 (Leadership Identity) unit, prompting me to critically analyze my assumptions and explore new perspectives on leadership, leadership identity, and introversion in leadership. Key Point of Cognitive Dissonance: Introversion in Leadership One of the most significant points of cognitive dissonance during my exploration of leadership and leadership identity was my newfound understanding of the power of introversion in leadership (Khalil, 2016). I initially believed that introversion was a limiting factor in my ability to lead effectively due to my perceived shyness and awkwardness in social interactions (Sinha & Hanuscin, 2017). However, through my engagement with scholarly literature, I discovered that introverts possess valuable qualities that can contribute positively to their leadership style and success in various organizational settings (Kuofie et al., 2015). For example, introverted leaders often display empathy, consistency, and a commitment to enhancing the capabilities of their team members, which are essential qualities for effective leadership (Kuofie et al., 2015). This understanding of the value of introversion in leadership challenged my previous assumptions, prompting me to reevaluate my leadership identity and reflect on how my introverted qualities could positively influence my leadership practice. Critical Element 1: Leadership Beyond Formal Roles The first critical element of leadership and leadership identity that shifted dramatically during the unit was my understanding of leadership beyond formal roles (De Nobile, 2018). I initially conceptualized leadership as solely tied to organizational hierarchy and specific roles; however, as I delved into the literature, I discovered that leadership is much more nuanced and can manifest in various ways regardless of formal positions or titles (Lipscombe et al., 2020). I learned that individuals can exercise leadership through their social influence, the development of supportive relationships, and their ability to inspire and empower others (Haslam & Steffens, 2021). This realization allowed me to adopt a more expansive perspective on leadership and leadership identity, recognizing that I can exercise leadership in various ways, independent of my position within an organizational structure. Critical Element 2: The Role and Power of Introversion in Leadership The second critical element of leadership and leadership identity that shifted dramatically during the unit was my understanding of the role and power of introversion in leadership (Khalil, 2016). Prior to my engagement with the academic literature, I viewed introversion as a hindrance to my leadership effectiveness (Sinha & Hanuscin, 2017). However, I learned that introverted leaders can contribute positively to organizational outcomes and create supportive, empowering environments for team members (Kuofie et al., 2015). Introverted leaders often excel at listening, empathizing with others, and focusing on long-term goals and strategies, qualities that enable them to foster strong relationships, and create an inclusive and supportive culture (Kuofie et al., 2015). This understanding allowed me to embrace my introverted qualities and recognize the unique strengths they bring to my leadership practice and identity. Critical Element 3: Leadership as an Ongoing Process of Identity Construction The third critical element of leadership and leadership identity that shifted dramatically during the unit was my understanding of leadership as an ongoing process of identity construction (Sun, 2016). I initially viewed my leadership identity as static and predominantly rooted in my formal role as the head of the MIS Team (De Nobile, 2018). However, as I engaged with the scholarly literature, I discovered that leadership identity is continually evolving, shaped by various experiences, relationships, and the stories we create about ourselves as leaders (Zheng et al., 2021). This understanding allowed me to see my leadership identity as a dynamic and fluid process, one that can evolve over time and be influenced by various contextual factors. I learned to approach my leadership practice with greater reflexivity, seeking opportunities for growth and self-improvement (Ryan & Loughland, 2020). Summary/Reflexive Overview Throughout my engagement with the EUN656 (Leadership Identity) unit, my understanding of leadership and leadership identity has evolved significantly. I have discovered the value of introversion in leadership, recognized the importance of leadership beyond formal roles, and embraced the notion of leadership as an ongoing process of identity construction. These insights have empowered me to approach my leadership practice with greater reflexivity and embrace the unique strengths that my introverted qualities bring to my leadership identity. By critically examining my assumptions and engaging with diverse perspectives on leadership and leadership identity, I have gained a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a leader and how my introverted qualities can positively contribute to my leadership practice. This understanding will guide my future leadership journey, allowing me to embody a more authentic, empowered, and effective leadership identity."},{"prompt":"Make “Initial Understanding of Leadership and Leadership Identity” longer by adding a lot of scholarly literature that you can so that you can further substantiate your claims.

This section should be around 500 words","completion":"My initial understanding of leadership and leadership identity was predominantly influenced by traditional and hierarchical perspectives on leadership, which emphasize the importance of organizational structure and the assignment of formal roles and responsibilities (Grint, 2011). Moreover, my perception of my introverted leadership style was further shaped by widely accepted theories such as trait theories, which highlight the significance of an individual's inherent characteristics in determining their leadership potential and effectiveness (Rennison, 2018). According to trait theories, certain qualities are considered essential for effective leadership, such as extroversion, charisma, and assertiveness (Guillén, Mayo, & Korotov, 2015). As an introverted leader, I initially assumed that my natural predisposition towards introversion would hinder my ability to perform well in leadership roles (Sinha & Hanuscin, 2017). This belief was further reinforced by my own experiences as the youngest member and lowest-ranking position within the Management Information Systems (MIS) Team, where I felt that my introverted qualities made it challenging to establish and maintain strong interpersonal connections with my team members (Briggs, 2007). However, as I began to engage with the literature on leadership and leadership identity, I was exposed to various alternative perspectives that challenged and expanded my initial understanding. For instance, I learned that leadership identity is a socially constructed phenomenon that continuously evolves through interactions with others, engagement in various leadership activities, and the development of self-awareness (Delaney, 2016). This realization prompted me to consider the importance of personal reflection, communication, and adaptation in my leadership practice (Ryan & Loughland, 2020). Furthermore, my exploration of the literature exposed me to transformational leadership theory, which emphasizes the importance of leaders who can inspire, empower, and develop meaningful relationships with their followers (Schyns, Kiefer, & Foti, 2020). According to this perspective, effective leadership is not simply determined by an individual's traits or their position within an organizational hierarchy, but rather, it involves the ability to influence and empower others through the establishment of shared goals and the promotion of personal growth (Lakeomski & Evers, 2017). This idea aligns well with the concept of identity leadership, which posits that an individual's self-concept, values, and beliefs play a crucial role in shaping their leadership identity and practice (Haslam & Steffens, 2021). In this view, introverted leaders can cultivate strong relationships with their followers by tapping into their natural propensity for empathy, active listening, and reflective thinking to help them better understand and empathize with the needs and perspectives of others (Gergen & Hersted, 2016). By engaging with these alternative perspectives on leadership and leadership identity, I was able to critically examine and challenge my initial assumptions about introversion and its implications for my leadership practice. As I considered the various strengths associated with introverted leadership, such as improved listening skills, heightened empathy, and a strong focus on individual well-being, I became more aware of how these qualities could positively contribute to my leadership identity and effectiveness (Kuofie et al., 2015; Cardona, Rey, & Craig, 2019). Furthermore, I discovered the importance of adopting a more open and flexible mindset towards leadership, recognizing the potential for growth and change within my leadership identity as I continue to engage in personal reflection, communication, and self-development (McCauley & Palus, 2021). Overall, this deeper exploration of the literature has significantly enriched my understanding of leadership and leadership identity, enabling me to adopt a more nuanced and empowering perspective on my leadership practice as an introverted leader."},{"prompt":"Make “Key Point of Cognitive Dissonance” longer by adding a lot of scholarly literature that you can so that you can further substantiate your claims.

As an introverted leader, I initially perceived my natural predisposition towards introversion as an obstacle in developing strong interpersonal relationships and leading effectively (Sinha & Hanuscin, 2017). However, as I delved deeper into the literature on leadership and leadership identity, I discovered various alternative perspectives that challenged these traditional assumptions about the role of introversion in leadership. For instance, contemporary theories of relational and distributed leadership emphasize the importance of building collaborative and supportive relationships within diverse teams, which can be facilitated by introverted leaders' natural abilities to listen, empathize, and reflect (Gergen & Hersted, 2016; Lakeomski & Evers, 2017). Additionally, research on servant leadership highlights the significance of placing the needs and well-being of team members first, a leadership approach that is often well-suited to introverted leaders who prioritize the welfare and development of others (Coetzer, Bussin, & Geldenhuys, 2017; Crippen & Willows, 2019). Moreover, as I explored the concept of leadership identity construction, I was exposed to the idea that leadership is not solely determined by an individual's traits but is also influenced by their self-concept, values, and beliefs (Delaney, 2016; Haslam & Steffens, 2021). This perspective suggests that introverted leaders can cultivate a strong leadership identity by leveraging their unique strengths, such as their capacity for empathy, active listening, and reflective thinking, in conjunction with their personal values and beliefs. In addition, emerging research has demonstrated the potential advantages of introverted leaders in various organizational contexts. Studies have shown that introverted leaders can be particularly effective in situations that require careful analysis and decision-making, as well as in leading proactive and self-starting team members who can benefit from a more hands-off approach (Kuofie et al., 2015; Khalil, 2016). Conversely, extroverted leaders may sometimes be perceived as domineering or overly assertive, potentially leading to decreased follower satisfaction and engagement (Guillén et al., 2015). This newfound understanding of the power of introversion in leadership prompted a significant shift in my perspective on my leadership identity and practice. Instead of seeing my introverted nature as a hindrance to effective leadership, I started to consider the unique strengths and advantages that my introverted qualities could bring to my role as a leader. Furthermore, I became more open to the idea that leadership is an ongoing process of identity construction, requiring adaptability, reflexivity, and a continuous investment in personal growth and self-improvement (Sun, 2016; Ryan & Loughland, 2020). By critically examining the literature on leadership and leadership identity, I was able to challenge and transform my understanding of the role of introversion in leadership. This shift in perspective has encouraged me to embrace my introverted qualities as valuable assets in various aspects of my leadership practice, including relationship building, decision-making, and fostering an inclusive and supportive team culture. By recognizing the unique strengths and contributions associated with introverted leadership, I can continue to cultivate a more authentic and empowered leadership identity that embraces my natural predispositions and values. In conclusion, my engagement with the literature on leadership and leadership identity has significantly challenged and reshaped my understanding of the role and power of introversion in leadership. By embracing these newfound insights, I can continue to develop my leadership identity and practice in a way that both leverages my unique strengths as an introverted leader and seeks to continually adapt and grow in response to new challenges and opportunities."},{"prompt":"Make “Critical Element 1: Leadership Beyond Formal Roles” longer by adding a lot of scholarly literature that you can so that you can further substantiate your claims.

However, as I engaged with the scholarly literature, I discovered alternative perspectives on leadership that emphasized the importance of social influence, relationships, personal growth, and adaptability, all of which are crucial aspects of effective leadership that extend beyond the confines of formal roles (Lipscombe et al., 2020; Haslam & Steffens, 2021). For instance, relational leadership theory posits that effective leadership relies on the development of supportive, empathic, and collaborative relationships between leaders and followers (Lakeomski & Evers, 2017). This approach highlights the importance of understanding, learning from, and adapting to the diverse perspectives and needs of team members, which can be achieved regardless of an individual's position within an organizational hierarchy (Gergen & Hersted, 2016). Additionally, distributed leadership theory suggests that leadership is a collective and dynamic process that can be shared among various individuals within a team or organization (De Nobile, 2021). This perspective on leadership recognizes that everyone holds unique experiences, knowledge, and skills that can contribute to the overall leadership capacity of the team, regardless of formal positions or titles (Lipscombe et al., 2020). Furthermore, the concept of identity leadership proposes that leaders can be influential and effective through their ability to create shared group identities, foster group cohesion, and facilitate collective action (Haslam & Steffens, 2021). This approach to leadership emphasizes the importance of embracing diversity, fostering a sense of belonging, and developing shared goals among team members, which can be achieved independent of formal roles or hierarchical positions (Schyns et al., 2020). As I engaged with these alternative perspectives on leadership, I began to recognize the potential for exercising leadership in various ways, irrespective of my position within an organizational structure. I learned that practicing leadership beyond formal roles enables me to cultivate meaningful relationships, empower others through the development of shared goals, and contribute to the overall effectiveness and success of my organization (Uhl-Bien & Carsten, 2016). This newfound understanding of leadership beyond formal roles has challenged and expanded my initial beliefs about leadership and leadership identity. By embracing the idea that leadership is not solely determined by organizational hierarchy or the assignment of specific responsibilities, I can adopt a more flexible and inclusive approach to leadership that acknowledges and leverages the diverse perspectives, experiences, and strengths of my team members (De Nobile, 2018; Lipscombe et al., 2020).

However, as I engaged with the scholarly literature, I discovered a wealth of evidence highlighting the unique strengths and advantages that introverted leaders can bring to their leadership practice (Kuofie et al., 2015; Lakeomski & Evers, 2017). For example, introverted leaders are often excellent active listeners, absorbing information and opinions from their team members thoroughly and thoughtfully (Kuofie et al., 2015). This deep engagement with the perspectives of others enables introverted leaders to make well-informed decisions, empathize with their team, and foster a supportive environment where everyone's contributions are valued (Gergen & Hersted, 2016). Additionally, introverted leaders are frequently characterized by their ability to focus intensely on long-term goals and strategies, dedicating significant time and effort to developing thoughtful plans for their team's success (Kuofie et al., 2015). This tendency towards foresight and strategic planning can contribute to greater organizational stability, clarity of purpose, and a strong sense of direction for team members (Lakeomski & Evers, 2017). Moreover, the literature also emphasizes the importance of adaptability and flexibility in leadership practice (Khalil, 2016; Schyns et al., 2020). Introverted leaders are often well-equipped to adapt their leadership style according to the diverse needs of their team members, adopting a more hands-off approach when appropriate and refining their methods to best support the individual growth and development of their team (Crippen & Willows, 2019). Furthermore, introverted leaders can excel at fostering an inclusive and supportive team culture, as their natural empathy and desire to understand others encourage open dialogue and collaboration (Gergen & Hersted, 2016). By creating an environment where everyone's perspectives are valued and respected, introverted leaders can foster greater trust, morale, and engagement within their team (Lakeomski & Evers, 2017). This shift in understanding the role and power of introversion in leadership has transformed my perspective of my leadership identity and practice. As I learned to embrace my introverted qualities, I became cognizant of the unique strengths they bring to my leadership style, such as active listening, empathy, strategic planning, adaptability, and inclusivity (Kuofie et al., 2015; Lakeomski & Evers, 2017).

However, as I explored the various perspectives on leadership and leadership identity, I came to recognize that leadership identity is not fixed but rather, it is a continually evolving process that is influenced by a multitude of factors, such as personal experiences, relationships, and continuous self-reflection (Delaney, 2016; Zheng et al., 2021). This discovery was further supported by the concept of leadership identity work, which suggests that individuals can actively shape their leadership identity through the stories they create about themselves, their experiences, and their relationships with others (Delaney, 2016; McCauley & Palus, 2021). This perspective emphasizes the importance of reflexivity and narrative in constructing one's leadership identity and highlights the potential for growth and change over time as individuals engage in this ongoing process (Ryan & Loughland, 2020). Moreover, the literature on adaptive and authentic leadership has further reinforced the importance of embracing the dynamic and fluid nature of leadership identity construction, as leaders who are adaptable and authentic can effectively respond to changing circumstances, challenges, and opportunities within their context (Gergen & Hersted, 2016; Schyns et al., 2020). These leadership approaches highlight the significance of continuous learning, personal growth, self-awareness, and the ability to adapt one's leadership style based on the needs of team members and the overall organizational context (Lakeomski & Evers, 2017; Haslam & Steffens, 2021). Furthermore, the concept of leadership-as-practice emphasizes the importance of considering leadership as a shared, collective, and ongoing process rather than a fixed set of traits or abilities possessed by individual leaders (Ralston & Evers, 2016; Riggio, Chaleff, & Blumen, 2018). This perspective challenges the static notion of leadership identity and instead encourages leaders to engage in an ongoing process of reflection and adaptation to refine their leadership effectiveness and enhance their ability to respond to the diverse, dynamic, and complex challenges faced by their team and organization (Ryan & Loughland, 2020). By acknowledging the importance of leadership as an ongoing process of identity construction, I have learned to view my leadership identity as dynamic, fluid, and adaptable, allowing me to respond effectively to various challenges and opportunities within my organizational context (Sun, 2016).

However, this does not mean that GPUs are better than CPUs in every aspect. Both have their unique strengths and are suitable for different purposes. Let's compare them briefly: 1. Parallelism: GPUs excel at parallel processing and handling tasks that require large-scale simultaneous computations, making them ideal for AI, machine learning, and graphics processing. On the other hand, CPUs are designed for serial processing and are better for tasks that involve complex logic and branching. 2. Core count and architecture: GPUs have thousands of smaller cores that focus on parallel processing, whereas CPUs have fewer, more powerful cores designed for serial processing and handling complex instructions. 3. Memory hierarchy: GPUs have a different memory architecture from CPUs, with a focus on high memory bandwidth and lower latency, which is beneficial for large-scale data processing used in AI and graphics applications. 4. General-purpose computing: CPUs are more versatile when it comes to general-purpose computing. They are designed to handle a wide range of tasks, including running operating systems, executing complex code, and managing multiple processes. In summary, current GPU technology offers better performance than CPUs in specific areas, such as AI, machine learning, and graphics processing. However, CPUs remain the preferred choice for general-purpose computing and tasks requiring complex logic and branching. Therefore, it is essential to choose the right processing unit based on the requirements of the specific application or task."},{"prompt":"As your explanation about CPU and GPU, how OS or software escalate task to CPU or GPU?","completion":"The operating system (OS) and software determine which tasks should be assigned to the CPU and GPU based on the nature of the task and available resources. Here's a high-level overview of how this process works: 1. Application and task design: Developers design software and applications with specific tasks best suited for CPUs or GPUs. For instance, AI and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch have built-in support for GPU acceleration. Similarly, graphics-intensive applications, such as video games and 3D modeling software, leverage the GPU's capabilities for rendering graphics. 2. API & Libraries: Developers use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and libraries to communicate with hardware components like the CPU and GPU. APIs like CUDA, cuDNN (for NVIDIA GPUs), or OpenCL (for a more general-purpose GPU computing) provide tools to perform GPU-accelerated computations. These libraries help offload certain tasks to the GPU while keeping other tasks on the CPU. 3. Task scheduling: Operating systems manage the scheduling of tasks and distribution of resources. When an application requests the use of the GPU or CPU, the OS allocates the required resources based on availability and priority. The OS kernel schedules tasks to be executed on the CPU, while tasks involving GPU processing are sent to the GPU via related APIs and the GPU driver. 4. Hardware drivers: GPU and CPU manufacturers provide hardware drivers that enable communication between the OS, applications, and the hardware. The drivers translate API calls and high-level instructions into instructions that the hardware can execute more effectively. 5. Runtime decisions: Some applications can dynamically choose to use either the CPU or GPU based on the system's resources, configuration, and performance needs during runtime. In such cases, the application determines which processor to use depending on the specific task and available hardware. In summary, the task assignment to the CPU or GPU is mainly determined by a combination of application design, OS scheduling, hardware drivers, and the use of APIs and libraries. Developers can optimize their software to take advantage of the unique capabilities of both processing units for better overall performance."},{"prompt":"My work is video editor and post processing.

With genetic modification, it is possible to construct these structures in humans, even though they are not naturally present. There are various genes and their functions that could be useful in constructing cat ears and tails in humans. The following genes are beneficial in such tasks, ranked in descending order of importance: Ear Formation: 1. SHH (Sonic Hedgehog) - Responsible for the development of the midline of the embryo, including the formation of the ear. Mutations in this gene can lead to anomalies such as cyclopia and abnormal ear development. [Reference: Ingham and McMahon (2001)] 2. PAX8 - Regulates the expression of other genes during ear formation, including the differentiation of sensory cells in the inner ear. [Reference: Bhattacharyya et al. (2014)] 3. SOX9 - Necessary for the development of the ear’s cartilage and the maturation of its sensory cells. [Reference: Wright et al. (2003)] 4. FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factors) - Regulate the growth, differentiation, and migration of cells during ear development. [Reference: Hartsock et al. (2014)] 5. NOTCH - Plays a role in ear development by regulating cell fate decisions, including determining the number and type of cells in the inner ear. [Reference: Kiernan et al. (2011)] 6. HOX genes - Responsible for the anterior-posterior patterning of the embryo and involved in the formation of the ear’s shape. [Reference: Izpisua-Belmonte et al. (1991)] Tail Formation: 1. Wnt - Regulates the growth and development of the dorsal (top) and ventral (bottom) sides of the embryo, including the formation of the tail. [Reference: De Robertis and Kuroda (2004)] 2. BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) - Plays a significant role in determining embryonic development and is responsible for the creation of limbs, the spinal cord, and the tail. [Reference: De Robertis and Kuroda (2004)] 3. CDX (Caudal-Related Transcription Factor) - Controls the expression of other genes involved in hindgut and tail development. This gene is also expressed in the tail bud and is critical for tail elongation. [Reference: Kim et al. (2011)] 4. TBXT (T-box transcription factor T) - This essential gene helps regulate the development of embryonic germ layers, including the formation of tail structures in the embryo. [Reference: Micallef et al. (2007)] 5. WNT3A - This gene contributes to tail elongation and dorsoventral patterning, inducing the expression of Hox genes in the tail bud that are critical to proper tail elongation and patterning. [Reference: ten Berge et al. (2008)] While these genes provide essential information related to the molecular events responsible for the formation of specialized organs in developing organisms, caution is necessary concerning genetic modification on humans due to ethical and safety concerns.

It is the opposite of a microservices architecture, in which the application is divided into smaller autonomous services that interact with each other through APIs. In a monolithic architecture, all the application logic is executed in a single process, and all the components share the same memory space. This allows for seamless communication between the components and makes it easier to manage the application as a whole. Since all the parts of the application are tightly integrated, changes to one part may require changes to other parts, creating dependencies between components. Pros of Monolithic Architecture: 1. Simple to develop: As all components are integrated into a single program, it is straightforward to develop and test all the parts of the application together. 2. Easy deployment: With only one program to deploy, it is relatively simple to manage the application's deployment process. 3. Performance: As the components share the same memory space, there is no need for inter-process communication, which can save time and improve performance. 4. Easy to understand: A monolithic application is easier to understand than a distributed architecture. It is easier to trace errors and debug issues in a single program. Cons of Monolithic Architecture: 1. Complexity: As the application grows in complexity, all the parts become tightly coupled, making it more challenging to manage the codebase. 2. Scalability: Scalability can become an issue as the application becomes larger. Adding more resources to a monolithic application may not solve the scalability problem. 3. Difficult to maintain: With so many components tightly integrated, making changes to a single component may have unforeseen consequences for other parts of the application. 4. Risky deployment: With all components packaged into a single application, deployment risk increases. Any issue in a single component can cause the entire application to fail."},{"prompt":"a short and non-trivial description of jQuery","completion":"jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies scripting HTML documents, handling events, manipulating the DOM, and making AJAX requests to the server.

It is named black box testing because, like a black box, the internal implementation details of the software are hidden from the tester, who is only concerned with the inputs and outputs of the system. Essentially, the tester treats the software as a \\"black box\\" and focuses on evaluating its behavior based on predefined input conditions and expected output results. Black box testing is generally used to verify the functionality, usability, and performance of software applications. During testing, the tester evaluates the application's behavior against functional and non-functional requirements specified in the software's documentation or another source of requirements. Black box testing typically involves various test techniques such as functional, regression, boundary value, and exploratory testing. The primary advantage of black box testing is that it provides an objective evaluation of the software's behavior based on the expected input and output conditions. However, it has some drawbacks, such as incomplete test coverage and the potential for missing defects related to the software's internal workings."},{"prompt":"What is white box testing?","completion":"White box testing is a software testing methodology where the tester tests the internal workings and structure of the software system, including its code, scripts, algorithms, and data flows. Unlike black box testing, white box testing requires testers to have knowledge of the internal workings of the software. In white box testing, the tester usually has access to the source code and uses techniques such as code reviews, unit testing, static analysis, and other testing tools to verify the software's internal behavior and quality. The primary goal of white box testing is to identify defects or vulnerabilities in the software's code, and it often involves testing the software's boundary conditions, error handling, and exception handling. Some of the pros of white box testing include the ability to uncover complex defects, optimize code performance, and verify compliance with industry standards and best practices. However, white box testing can be time-consuming, expensive, and may not provide a complete picture of how the software performs in real-world conditions.

Nonetheless, lignin is under-exploited as a renewable chemical feedstock due to the limited number of efficient and selective downstream processing strategies available. Various methods have been extensively studied for the conversion of lignin into aromatic products that can broadly be classified as catalytic oxidative degradation, catalytic reductive degradation and acid/base-catalyzed degradation2,3,4,6. Catalytic oxidative degradation has a number of advantages compared to other catalytic fractionation methods including hydrogenolysis (a reductive process), and acid/base-catalyzed degradation4,7,8. Catalytic oxidative degradation advantageously take place under mild and environmentally benign conditions, which contrasts with hydrogenolysis that uses noble metal catalysts, high reaction temperatures and pressures, or the use of corrosive acid/base-catalyzed degradation reagents. In addition, catalytic oxidative degradation has the potential to retain key functionality in the products that could be relevant in subsequent synthetic steps9,10,11. Many homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic oxidative methods that cleave the C–C bonds of the alkyl side chains to depolymerize lignin have been reported, but typically they are limited by poor selectivity and consequently low product yields (Fig. 1)12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23. The catalysts reported for the oxidative fragmentation of lignin are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.The critical issue that must be solved to overcome the aforementioned limitations is that the phenolic hydroxy group is unstable under oxidative conditions24, leading to side reactions including repolymerization and ring opening reactions, which generates complex polymers, oligomers, and non-aromatic side products25,26,27,28. Hence, aromatic products are isolated in low yields in certain direct oxidative degradation reactions. Diaryl ethers are typically prepared from cross-coupling reactions between petrochemical-derived substrates, specifically, phenols with excess electrophiles, i.e. aryl halides, or nucleophiles, i.e. boronic acids29. Inspired by Cu-catalyzed oxidative cross-coupling reactions between of nucleophiles (phenols, anilines, etc.) with organoboronic acids to afford poly-functionalized diaryl ethers and diaryl amines30,31,32,33,34, we decided to explore the utility of organoboronic acids to extract the reactive phenolic intermediates generated during the oxidative degradation of lignin (Fig. 1). We discovered that this protocol prevents common side reactions initialed by phenolic intermediates allowing functionalized diaryl ethers to be obtained in near-theoretical maximum yields. Using lignin as a starting material to synthesize functionalized diaryl ether is advantageous as lignin is an abundant, inexpensive and renewable material1,2,3,4,5,6. The direct conversion of lignin to diaryl ethers in a single step process requires fewer reagents and solvents than a two-step process in which phenols are initially generated from lignin and then further transformed5,10,23.","completion":"This article discusses various methods for the conversion of lignin into aromatic products and highlights the advantages of catalytic oxidative degradation, which takes place under mild and environmentally friendly conditions.

After the oxidative degradation/coupling step, a methylation step was performed to transforms any carboxylic acid groups into methyl ester groups, to facilitate gas chromatography (GC) analysis. From the Cu salts screened, copper(II) triflate (Cu(OTf)2) was found to be the most effective catalyst together with bathophenanthroline (L1 in Fig. 2b) co-catalyst, affording the diaryl ether products (1-4b) in 92% yield (Fig. 2a, Entry 5). Note that other ligands were evaluated (Fig. 2a, b), but none were as effective as L1. Since the triflate anions in Cu(OTf)2 are weakly coordinating and readily displaced35,36. Cu(OTf)2 is expected to react with L1, a bidentate N-donor ligand, to form the active catalyst in situ. L1 is an electron-rich ligand that is expected to increase the electron density on the Cu center, which facilitates oxidation Cu(II) to Cu(III), a key step in the reaction (the more electron rich the Cu center the easier it is to oxidize)31,37. A CuL1 complex is formed in situ (evidenced by mass spectrometry, Supplementary Fig. 1), which serves as the actual catalyst, and is sufficiently stable to be isolated after reaction, recycled and reused with only a minor loss in activity (Supplementary Fig. 1). The GC spectrum showing the product distribution is given in Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2. As a representative hardwood2, the aromatic rings of beech wood consist of 79.5% syringyl (S), and 20.5% guaiacyl (G) units (Supplementary Fig. 3). The main diaryl ether products are the syringyl type methyl ester (1b, 68%) and the guaiacyl type methyl ester (3b, 15%), along with syringyl- and guaiacyl-type aldehyde products (2b, 8% and 4b, 1%, respectively), demonstrating that the aromatic rings of lignin may be extracted successfully as functionalized aromatic diaryl ether products using this method.

The remaining HSQC signals may be attributed to unreacted linkages of lignin and side products derived from the excess boronic acid used (Supplementary Fig. 2). In the absence of 1a, no aromatic monomer products were detected under the optimized reaction conditions, confirming that the boronic acid captures the reactive phenolic intermediates (Fig. 3). The composition and structure of lignin varies with the type of wood used (Supplementary Figs. 3–5), hence several types were evaluated (Fig. 3). Lignin from poplar, a hardwood, is primarily composed of S aromatic units. Poplar lignin was evaluated under the optimized reaction conditions, affording diaryl ethers in 95% yield, with high selectivity to the syringyl-type product 1b, which was obtained in 71% yield (Fig. 3). Pine lignin, containing G and coumaryl (H) aromatic units without S units, affords the G-type diaryl ether 3b as main product in 71% yield (Fig. 3). Raw beech wood sawdust was tested using the standard reaction conditions with diaryl ether products obtained in only 10% yield (Supplementary Fig. 11).","completion":"This study explored the use of organoboronic acids to extract reactive phenolic intermediates generated during oxidative degradation of lignin, producing functionalized diaryl ethers. The reaction was monitored using short-range 13C-1H correlation (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy, which showed complete degradation of the lignin structure and the presence of the expected major product and other products. The study confirmed that the boronic acid captures the reactive phenolic intermediates and demonstrated the production of diaryl ethers from different types of wood, including poplar and pine, with high selectivity to the syringyl-type product in poplar. Raw beech wood sawdust was tested, but only produced a low yield of diaryl ethers. The study provides a promising approach for the efficient utilization of lignin as a sustainable source of aromatic compounds, contributing to the development of a more sustainable bio-based economy. The results are expected to have significant implications for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries."},{"prompt":"请再根据补充的资料修改。补充资料：The scope of the boronic acid and related coupling reagents was also evaluated using beech wood lignin under the optimized reaction conditions (Fig. 4). Specifically, phenylboronic acid (2a) affords the S type diaryl ether (6b) in 66% yield. Phenylboronic acids functionalized with electron-withdrawing halogen (1a, 3-4a) or trifluoromethyl (5-6a) substituents are tolerated and afford the desired diaryl ether products in 64–71% yield. Nitro (7a), ester (8a), and methoxy (9a) substituents at the para-position result in slightly lower yields (49–56%). Biphenyl boronic acid (10a) was transformed in 61% yield. Several organic borate esters (11a–13a) were also tested and are less effective in the aromatic extraction reaction (yields ranging from 23 to 55%), and the phenyltrifluoroborate salt (14a) and alkyl boronic acid (15a, 16a) do not function as coupling reagents. In general, phenylboronic acids and borate esters could be employed as effective extraction reagents for the transformation of lignin into functionalized diaryl ether products. Diaryl ethers with ortho-methoxy and/or para-carboxy groups are commonly encountered as intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceutical and natural products, such as chrysophaentins38,39, himalain A40 and certain biological inhibitors41,42.","completion":"This study evaluated the scope of boronic acid and related coupling reagents using beech wood lignin under optimized reaction conditions.

Control experiments employing diol (c, 1-phenyl-1,2-propandiol), benzyl alcohol (d), and acetophenone (e) as substrates were conducted to confirm that Cα–Cβ bond cleavage takes place under the reaction conditions (Fig. 5a). All three different kinds of Cα–Cβ bonds were successfully cleaved affording methyl benzoate in excellent yield (90–98%). These results are in agreement with previous reports concerning Cu catalyzed C–C activation initiated by the oxidation of hydroxy groups (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13)13,15,18,43,44. In addition, the reaction of protected phenols in which the hydroxy group is modified with glycol (f), acetic acid (g) and formic acid (h) groups with phenyl boronic acid (2a) affords the expected diphenyl ether product in 97–99% yield (Fig. 5b).

While both methods offer some advantages, they differ in design and popularity among professional fixed gear and track cyclists. Let's compare and contrast their performance: 1. Pedal straps: Pedal straps (or foot straps) are wide, durable straps that wrap around the pedal and the cyclist's shoe, providing a snug fit and keeping the foot in place during all phases of cycling. Some professional track cyclists prefer straps for their secure fit and ease of entry and exit. Advantages of pedal straps: - They provide a more secure connection between the foot and the pedal, making it easier to apply power to the pedals consistently, ultimately increasing overall performance. - They allow for better foot positioning on the pedals, which helps prevent hot spots and pressure points on the feet. - Pedal straps are considered more comfortable and less restrictive than toe clips. - They tend to be more easily adjustable, allowing riders to find the perfect fit. - They can accommodate a wide range of shoe sizes and types, including casual, athletic, and cycling-specific shoes. Disadvantages of pedal straps: - They can be more difficult to get into and out of, particularly in high-intensity racing situations where every second counts. - They may not offer the same level of retention as toe clips since the secureness relies on the tightness of the straps. - Some riders might find pedal straps too bulky or aesthetically unappealing. 2. Toe clips: Toe clips (or toe cages) are a more traditional method of securing the foot to the pedal. They are metal or plastic cages that attach to the pedal and cover the front portion of the shoe. A strap then goes over the top of the foot, securing the shoe inside the cage. Advantages of toe clips: - They provide a more immediate connection between the foot and the pedal since the foot is held tightly within the cage. - They are generally easier to get into and out of, making them suitable for racing situations where riders need to quickly clip in and out while maintaining speed. - They are more budget-friendly and can be found on a wide variety of pedal types. - Toe clips have a more minimalistic and classic look, which some riders might find aesthetically pleasing. Disadvantages of toe clips: - They can be less comfortable and more restrictive than pedal straps, as the rigid cage can create pressure points on the foot. - They may not offer as much adjustability or customization in terms of fit, which might lead to discomfort during long rides. - Toe clips are usually not as compatible with casual shoes or those with thick soles, limiting their usability by more casual riders or those without cycling-specific shoes. - They tend to have a higher learning curve due to the necessity of precisely positioning the foot inside the cage. In conclusion, both pedal straps and toe clips have their advantages and disadvantages for professional fixed gear and track cycling. While some riders might prefer the comfort and secure fit of pedal straps, others might opt for the easier engagement and disengagement of toe clips. Ultimately, the choice between pedal straps and toe clips comes down to personal preference, riding style, and the specific demands of the race or event."},{"prompt":"create a bot that predicts uprising cryptos and sells losing cryptos to buy the rising ones","completion":"Creating a bot that can accurately predict uprising cryptocurrencies and sell losing ones to buy rising ones requires a combination of technical skills and market analysis. Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I'm not able to create such a bot for you. However, I can provide you with a rough idea of the components and strategy you'd need to put together a bot like this: 1. Market data: To predict the rise and fall of cryptocurrencies, the bot would need access to real-time and historical market data. This can be achieved by using APIs provided by different cryptocurrency exchanges. 2. Technical analysis: The bot should perform technical analysis to identify trends and patterns in the price data. This can be done using various technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger bands, Fibonacci retracements, and more. 3. Fundamental analysis: In addition to technical analysis, the bot should also perform fundamental analysis to assess the value and future potential of a particular cryptocurrency. This may include factors like the technology behind the project, use cases, team, partnerships, market sentiment, etc. 4. Machine learning and predictive analysis: Develop a machine learning model that takes into account both technical and fundamental factors to predict the price trends of cryptocurrencies. The model should be trained using historical data and continuously updated with new market data. 5. Risk management: Implement proper risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and diversifying your crypto portfolio. 6. Trading strategy: Implement a trading strategy that takes into account the predictions made by the model. For example, sell losing cryptos and buy rising ones based on the predicted trends. 7. Automation: Automate the entire process using a programming language like Python, and integrating APIs for accessing data and executing trades. 8. Monitoring and optimization: Regularly monitor the performance of the bot and optimize its trading strategy and machine learning models based on new data and any changes in the market. Building and maintaining such a bot is a highly complex task that requires experience in software development, data analysis, and financial markets. Additionally, predicting the movement of cryptocurrencies is challenging, and there's no guarantee that the bot will perform well in all market conditions.

Use less passive voice. Refrain from using long sentences (over 20 words per sentence). Use headings and list","completion":"Blackout Tattoos: The Ultimate Show of Solidarity, Art or Rebellion? Introduction As body art evolves, new trends emerge in the tattooing landscape. One such trend that has generated much debate among tattoo enthusiasts is the \\"blackout tattoo.\\" Blackout tattoos are large areas of the body covered entirely in solid black ink, creating a bold and striking visual statement. This article will delve into the world of blackout tattoos, exploring their origins, meanings, and the pain factor that comes with such extensive inkwork. We will also look into the motivations behind why people choose to get such an extreme form of body art. Origins of Blackout Tattoos Although the exact origins of blackout tattoos are unknown, they have been associated with various cultural and subcultural groups over the years. One of the earliest documented cases of blackout tattoos is from the ancient Polynesian and Melanesian tribes, who used them as a rite of passage, spiritual protection, or a symbol of status. In the modern world, blackout tattoos have been linked to subcultures such as the biohackers and the “techwear” movement, wherein body modifications and futuristic aesthetics are popular. What Does a Blackout Tattoo Symbolize? 1. Rebirth and Starting Fresh One meaning behind blackout tattoos is the idea of rebirth and wiping the slate clean. In many cases, a blackout tattoo is used to cover up an old or unwanted tattoo, symbolizing a fresh start or a turning point in the wearer's life. This can represent leaving behind past mistakes or commemorating a significant personal change. 2. Commitment to Art and Expression For some, blackout tattoos are the ultimate form of commitment to the world of body art. They showcase a deep appreciation for the art form and a willingness to embrace ink as a vital part of one's identity. These tattoos often serve as conversation starters, and the wearer may view them as a means to educate others about tattooing as an art form. 3. Rebellion and Non-Conformity Blackout tattoos can also be seen as an act of rebellion against societal norms and expectations. The dramatic impact of a blackout tattoo can signify a rejection of convention and an embracing of individuality. For some, the bold nature of these tattoos may even symbolize a pushback against the stigma that tattoos still hold in many parts of the world. Blackout Tattoo Pricing Because of their sheer size, blackout tattoos are typically more expensive than traditional designs. Tattoo artists typically charge by the hour or by the session, which means that the final cost will be determined by the amount of ink, the level of detail, and the number of sessions required. On average, a blackout tattoo could cost anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000, depending on factors such as the artist's experience and location. Additionally, keep in mind that the tattoo will need regular touch-ups, which will add to the overall cost of maintaining the design. The Pain Factor Blackout tattoos are often described as being significantly more painful than traditional designs. This is due to several factors: 1. Extensive Coverage Blackout tattoos require large swaths of the skin to be inked, which is one of the primary reasons they are more painful. The extent of the coverage may require multiple sessions, causing the body to go through the process of healing and then being retraumatized by the needle. 2. Overlap As black ink is layered over other tattoos, the pain is often intensified. This layering effect may be due to the difference in color contrast or due to the consequent scarring that can result from blackout tattoos. 3. Sensitivity Some body parts are more sensitive to pain than others, which can make certain blackout tattoos more difficult to endure. For example, the ribs, chest, and inner thigh are known to be particularly sensitive locations. The Emotional Impact of Blackout Tattoos A significant factor to consider when getting a blackout tattoo is the emotional impact it may have on the individual. People undergo challenges for different reasons; some may want to reclaim their body after trauma, while others may use it as a mechanism to seek attention, validation, or acceptance. Understanding one's motivation behind wanting a blackout tattoo is vital, as its permanence and boldness can have lasting consequences on one's self-esteem, mental health, and relationships. In some cases, people may rush into getting a blackout tattoo without fully grasping the gravity of the decision, which can lead to feelings of regret and dissatisfaction later. Aftercare and Healing Process The aftercare and healing process for blackout tattoos differs somewhat from standard tattoos due to the intensity and scope of the design. Proper aftercare is crucial to avoid complications such as infection, scarring, or uneven results. Here are some tips for optimal healing: 1. Keep it Clean Maintaining cleanliness is essential in preventing infections. Gently wash the tattooed area with a mild soap and warm water, and avoid using any abrasive materials. Repeat this process several times a day, making sure to pat the area dry with a clean towel. 2. Moisturize Use a recommended tattoo aftercare lotion or ointment and apply a thin layer on the tattooed area. This will help keep the skin hydrated and promote healing. Avoid using petroleum-based products, as they can clog the pores and hinder the healing process. 3. Protect from Sunlight For the first two weeks after getting a blackout tattoo, keep the area out of direct sunlight as much as possible. When exposure is unavoidable, use a high-SPF sunscreen to protect the skin. 4. Expect Peeling and Scabbing As with any tattoo, peeling and light scabbing are normal parts of the healing process. Avoid picking or scratching the area, as this can lead to scarring or uneven results. In Conclusion Blackout tattoos stir up a strong reaction among people, for various reasons. For some, it's the ultimate act of commitment to the art form, while for others, it serves as a symbol of rebirth, rebellion, or solidarity. However, bear in mind that these tattoos are not for everyone, especially those who may not be prepared for the pain or commitment that comes with this extreme form of body art. Before diving into a blackout tattoo, it's crucial to consider the long-term implications and ensure that you're working with a highly experienced and reputable tattoo artist who understands your motivation and vision."},{"prompt":"please create an expanded back story based on the following: 6.

It's crucial to balance scientific and ethical considerations before applying such modifications to humans. Regarding the differences between human genes and animal genes, gene length and composition often vary between species [Reference: Gregory et al. (2007)]. For example, human genes are often longer than their animal counterparts. Long non-coding RNA segments in humans affect gene expression, protein production, and overall gene regulation during development. [Reference: Amaral et al. (2008)]. In addition to gene length and composition, humans and animals demonstrate variability in gene deletions and insertions (indels) [Reference: Carbone et al. (2014)]. For instance, behavioral differences between primates and humans may result from specific indels in the autism-associated gene, MET [Reference: Sousa et al. (2017)]. Therefore, despite similarities in gene functions between species, differences exist and regularly shape genetic outcomes across species. Bibliography: - Amaral, P. P., Clark, M. B., Gascoigne, D.

Introduction The piquant literary form of adult fiction narrated by a child protagonist has enjoyed considerable appeal and popularity in the twentieth-century literature. Far from being a simplistic and merely appetizing ploy to engage the reader, child narrators in adult literature often challenge and subvert the conventional boundaries of authority, innocence, and wisdom, enabling the authors to offer striking perspectives on the world around them. The distinctive narrative voice of a child often carries penetrating insights and profound socio-cultural implications, leading to a widening of the reader's horizon and opening up the pathways for a wealth of critical interpretations. This essay will delve into the captivating realm of the literary criticism of the novels employing child narrators in adult fiction and explore some of the pivotal arguments, themes and counterclaims put forward by the critics in relation to this enchanting narrative device. By doing so, the essay aims to illuminate the underlying complexities, controversies, and the enduring appeal of the literature fashioned through the ingenuity of child narrators. II. The Subversion of Authority One of the critical facets of the child narrators in adult literature is the way they disrupt and subvert the pre-established realms of authority, power, and control. The critics argue that by employing a child as a focal point of narration, the authors intend to bring into question the unimpeded might of the adult world, highlighting the falsities and incongruities embedded in the social fabric. This contentious idea is succinctly encapsulated by the critic Peter Hollindale in his poignant assertion that through the utilization of a child's voice, \\"the adult consciousness is challenged by the extent to which authority, a cultural construct, is made to look foolish by the simple force of a child's innocent-eye perspective\\" (Hollindale 136). In the heart-rending odyssey of Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' the protagonist-narrator, Scout Finch, unwittingly exposes the unmitigated hypocrisy and unjustness permeating the deep south of the United States during the early decades of the twentieth century. As Marjorie Lightfoot claims, “Scout perfectly straddles the complexities of understanding community and events surrounding family life. Not yet mature enough to fully understand, nor naïve enough to overlook, the vast range of emotions and implications of the events she bears witness to” (Lightfoot 65). Similarly, in the dystopian narrative of Jerzy Kosinski's 'The Painted Bird,' the anonymous child narrator provides an unequivocal testimony of the horrendous atrocities and the moral depravity unleashed during the cataclysmic times of the Second World War. The critic Daniel R. Schwarz staunchly supports the significance of a child's voice in unraveling the chilling veracity in Kosinski's controversial novel: \\"Kosinski's use of the child's perspective emphasizes the absence of a moral order, as there is no pattern in the events that occur. The child himself, occasionally grotesquely portrayed as being motivated by the aggressive, almost insane desires that he observes, seems a metaphor of the instinctual side of human behavior that Kosinski so fearlessly dwells on\\" (Schwarz 75). III. The Fragility and Reliability of the Innocent Voice The concept of the child's innocence has been central to many works of adult fiction that focus on child narrators. The paradoxical nature of the innocent voice, often oscillating between the realms of fragility and reliability, has been a prominent theme in the critical discourse surrounding these works. As the critic Jana Giles puts it, \\"The innocence of child narrators is often sought to be imbricated within the ambiguous and shifting parameters of illusory perception, leading to profound intricacies in the evaluative processes of the readers\\" (Giles 217). The novels with child narrators often delve into the poignant intersections of innocence, wisdom, and moral agency, and explore the ethical dilemmas that arise in response. The uncomfortable yet illuminating episode of Holden Caulfield's confrontation with a prostitute in J.D Salinger's 'The Catcher in the Rye' is a classic example, where the child narrator's innocent and straightforward worldview clashes with the adult sensibilities, blurring the boundaries between right and wrong. The critic Michael Mitchell maintains that \\"Holden's innocent but perceptive understanding of the adult world's hypocrisy and deceit, juxtaposed with his own moral rigidity, serves to both reinvigorate and challenge the reader's sense of moral propriety\\" (Mitchell 132). Likewise, in Carson McCullers' 'The Member of the Wedding,' the child protagonist-narrator, Frankie Addams, grapples with her burgeoning sexuality and the complexities of the adult world, revealing the inherent fragility and unreliability of the innocent voice in terms of the emotional and psychological development. As Sarah Gleeson-White aptly contends, \\"McCullers' artful portrayal of Frankie's naive understanding of marriage, her inability to fathom adult relationships, and her adolescent fantasies complexifies the narrative and imbues it with profound layers of meaning and interpretation\\" (Gleeson-White 89). IV. Conclusion The critical analysis of the novels with child narrators in adult literature reveals a plethora of themes, arguments, and counterclaims that exemplify the richness and complexity of this fascinating narrative device. These child narrators often challenge the established constructs of authority and power, and simultaneously grapple with the intricacies of innocence, wisdom, and moral agency. The multi-dimensional portrayal of the child's voice in adult literature has paved the way for a wide array of interpretations, allowing the readers and critics alike to engage in the deeply immersive and transformative process of unravelling the hidden mysteries and potentialities of the literary universe."},{"prompt":"华为手机隐藏id锁","completion":"我作为AI语言模型，无法提供任何破解、破坏手机安全的方法，也不鼓励这样的行为。请遵守相关法律法规，珍惜您的个人信息安全。"},{"prompt":"华为mate50pro充电无法到8","completion":"对于这个问题，可以尝试以下几种方法： 1. 更换充电线和充电器：这有可能是由于充电线或者充电器坏了，导致充电速度变慢。尝试更换线与充电器来查看问题是否能够得到解决。 2. 清除手机缓存：在手机使用一段时间后，手机缓存会堆积很多，这会影响充电效果。可以在手机设置中找到缓存清除、内存优化等选项进行清理。 3. 检查手机充电状态：检查手机内部充电状态，查看是不是软件问题，可以到设置->电池->电池健康来查看。 4. 重启手机：有可能是由于系统或者其他问题导致的，可以尝试重启一下手机来解决。 如果以上方法都不能解决问题，建议联系华为客服进行进一步的检查和解决。"},{"prompt":"乔帮主hk8pro是什么牌子","completion":"作为 AI 语言模型，我无法确切地回答此问题。可能是因为“乔帮主”并不是一家广泛公认的品牌或公司名字。如果您能提供更多相关信息，我会努力为您提供更准确的回答。"},{"prompt":"jbl10号是监听音箱吗","completion":"JBL 10 号可能是指 JBL Go 2 这种小型便携式蓝牙音箱。它虽然音量不大，但体积小巧，容易携带，适合随身携带。它可以通过蓝牙无线连接手机、平板电脑等设备进行音频播放，通常用于室内或者户外短期使用、个人使用等场景。除此之外，JBL 还生产了许多不同型号的音箱和耳机等音频产品，您可以根据自己的需要选择不同的产品。"},{"prompt":"完达山本草凉茶是什么味道","completion":"完达山本草凉茶是一款中药凉茶，主要成分是黄芩、板蓝根等中草药。其口感偏苦，同时也有一定的清凉口感。由于每个人的味觉和感受不同，如果您尚未尝试，可以购买少量尝试，以了解自己的口感喜好。"},{"prompt":"电滑遥控不匹配","completion":"电滑遥控不匹配的原因可能有很多，以下是一些常见的可能原因以及解决方法： 1. 遥控器与电滑频率不匹配：遥控器与电滑的频率必须匹配才能控制电滑，如果不匹配，需要将遥控器换成正确频率的遥控器。你可以尝试换个遥控器来对比一下是否可以对电滑进行控制。 2. 遥控器电池电量过低：如果遥控器的电池电量过低，会导致遥控器无法正常工作。尝试更换新的电池或者充电后再进行连接。 3. 遥控器加密失效：有些电滑遥控器会自动加密，如果遥控器的加密失效或者电池拆卸，需要重新配对电滑和遥控器。具体可以根据电滑和遥控器的说明书进行操作。 4. 遥控器连接问题：有些遥控器连接不良会导致电滑无法连接或者无法控制。尝试重新连接一下遥控器和电滑设备。 如果以上方法都不能解决问题，可以尝试联系商家或者售后客服寻求帮助。"},{"prompt":"雷鸟鹏756se怎么样","completion":"雷鸟鹏 756SE 是雷鸟鹏公司的一款游戏本，它有以下主要特点： 1. 配置高：装备了八代 Intel Core i7 处理器、NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050Ti 独立显卡、16GB内存和 512GB 固态硬盘等。这些配置可以提供出色的游戏和多媒体处理性能。 2. 设计简洁：机身黑色锋利的设计，简约大气，有着明显的游戏电脑的风格。 3. 散热优秀：该电脑的散热系统设计合理，散热效果优秀，可以有效保证游戏流畅性。同时也能在一定程度上保护硬件安全。 4. 性价比高：它的价格相对于同等配置的竞争对手来说比较实惠，具有较高的性价比。 总的来说，雷鸟鹏 756SE 是一款中高配的游戏本，具有不错的性能和性价比，适合对游戏性能有一定要求的用户。"},{"prompt":"вычислить комплексный интеграл: Интеграл |z-3[=1/2 (e^zdz)/sinz","completion":"У нас есть интеграл, содержащий модуль, который является нечётной функцией, поэтому мы можем воспользоваться формулой Коши для вычисления этого интеграла.

Для начала заметим, что знаменатель подынтегрального выражения имеет два комплексных корня: x1 = (1 + sqrt(3)i) / 2 x2 = (1 - sqrt(3)i) / 2 Для вычисления интеграла по оси действительных чисел, мы можем воспользоваться полюсами функции f(z) = 1 / (z^2 - z + 1)^2. Полюса будут расположены в точках, где знаменатель обращается в нуль, то есть в точках x1 и x2. Заметим, что оба полюса лежат в верхней полуплоскости комплексной плоскости, поэтому для вычисления интеграла мы будем использовать полуокружность верхнего полукруга большого радиуса R, находящегося выше оси действительных чисел. Рассмотрим функцию f(z) = 1 / (z^2 - z + 1)^2 и выберем контур, который состоит из верхней полуокружности окружности с радиусом R, находящейся выше оси действительных чисел, и отрезка от точки -R до точки R по оси действительных чисел. Интеграл по этому контуру можно выразить как сумму интеграла по полуокружности и интеграла по отрезку. Интеграл по полуокружности затухает при R, поэтому он стремится к нулю при R → ∞ в силу оценки Мира и оценки модуля факториала. Следовательно, мы можем записать: ∮(C) f(z) dz = ∫(-R до R) f(x) dx + ∫верхней полуокружности f(z) dz (здесь С - выбранный контур) Интеграл ∫(-R до R) f(x) dx можно вычислить прямым интегрированием, используя метод частичных дробей. Получится следующее выражение: ∫(-R до R) f(x) dx = 4/3 * (√3 / 2R - 1/2) + 2 * ∫(0 до R) (x^2 - x + 1)^(-2) dx Поскольку интеграл ∫(0 до ∞) (x^2 - x + 1)^(-2) dx сходится, интеграл ∫(0 до R) (x^2 - x + 1)^(-2) dx по оценке Мира асимптотически равен √3 / (2R). Заменив этот интеграл на его асимптотическое значение, получим: ∫(-R до R) f(x) dx = 2 * (√3 / (2R) - 1/3) Таким образом, мы можем записать: ∮(C) f(z) dz = 2 * (√3 / (2R) - 1/3) + ∫верхней полуокружности f(z) dz. При R → ∞ интеграл по верхней полуокружности стремится к нулю, потому что интегрируемая функция ограничена и затухает при R. Следовательно, мы получаем: ∮(C) f(z) dz = 4πi / √3 - 4/3. Значение интеграла по оси действительных чисел равно половине значению интеграла по комплексной плоскости. Следовательно, мы можем записать: ∫(-∞ до ∞) dx / (x^2 - x + 1)^2 = (1/2) * Res(f, x1) + (1/2) * Res(f, x2) = 2 * Res(f, x1) = 4πi / √3 - 4/3.

By analyzing the critically acclaimed works of such authors as J.D. Salinger, Harper Lee, John Boyne, Mark Haddon, and Emma Donoghue, we argue that the incorporation of child narrators in adult literature serves a dual purpose in enhancing the thematic complexities and sustaining the aesthetic appeal of their respective fictions. Introduction Contemporary literature of the 20th century has witnessed a striking proliferation of young, if not adolescent, voices occupying the narrative center stage in adult fiction. The novelistic voices of such improbable yet enchanting storytellers as Jerome David Salinger's Holden Caulfield, Harper Lee's Scout Finch, or Mark Haddon's Christopher Boone, to cite but a few examples, have held successive generations of readers enthralled and captivated by their markedly emotive renderings of their respective life-worlds. This critical essay seeks to interrogate certain abiding aspects of the overall narrative strategy undergirding the portrayal of child narrators in adult fiction, specifically their usefulness in highlighting some thematic concerns that may otherwise be obfuscated in the conventional narrative plotlines. Simultaneously, by examining the manner in which these child narrators articulate their subjective concerns, fears, hopes, and aspirations, we shall endeavor to flesh out some of the key stylistic innovations attendant to the innovative use of the limited narrative perspective in contemporary adult fiction. Section I: Narrative-As-Catharsis Drawing upon seminal works of 20th-century literary criticism such as Susan Suleiman's \\"The Reader in the Text,\\" or Claire Whitehead's \\"The Poetics of Childhood,\\" this section shall explore the theoretical underpinnings for embracing the child-narrative perspective in adult fiction. We shall argue that the principal rationale for deploying a child narrator lies in exposing the irrational underbelly of a normatively driven world, where strictures of order, reason, convention, and tradition often hold sway. On this account, the child's naivete and resultant blurriness of perception become tools to cast familiar, adult-occupied worlds in strange hues, thereby sustaining a ceaseless sense of wonder that keeps at bay the corrosive forces of cynicism. In this regard, we shall draw on an interpretive subfield of literary criticism exemplified by Sharon Lockhart's essay \\"Beyond the Myth of Childhood Innocence\\" and Sodiqin Kombinato's dissertation \\"The Representation of Innocence and Experience in Children's Literature.\\" This section shall unearth the ways in which the child narrators in Twentieth-Century adult novels serve the structure of the story from some established plotline in positing the child-voice at the center of their universe. Section II: The Fragments as Windows to the Whole Moving beyond a theoretical substratum, this section shall examine the stylistic devices by which the voice of the child narrator is rendered realistic in representative works of adult fiction. Through close analysis of pivotal episodes from novels such as \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,\\" \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\\" and \\"Room,\\" we shall illustrate that the use of the child perspective enables adult readers to inhabit a fragmented, partial, and often skewed worldview. The child's voice thus provides a uniquely refreshing means for reclaiming, albeit fleetingly, the fleeting intensity and ceaseless sense of wonder fringed with uncertainty. In this regard, G.K. Chesterton's pithy observation that \\"the whole object of true education is to make obvious things astonishing\\" encapsulates the raison d'etre for the narrative perspective of these novels. Cherry-picking from critics such as Claudia Nelson's \\"Representing the Child as a Reader: The Complicit Innocence of the Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" and Jacqueline Cahill's \\"Narrating the Artist's Life: Adolescent Autobiographical Narratives in Adult Fiction,\\" this section shall detail the various narrative devices employed by novelists to mirror the child's vision. Section III: The Emotional Scope and Ethical Potentials of Engaging with Child Narrators Now equipped with an appreciation of the theoretical and stylistic aspects of child narrators in adult literature, we shall, in this section, scrutinize the contribution of child narrators towards an emotional and ethical engagement on the part of the adult readership. To this end, the essay shall explore the fertile possibilities for capturing and retaining a sense of wonder and connectedness that the child's voice affords to the adult reader. This section shall further engage with scholarly debates, such as Heather Montgomery's \\"Disturbing Metaphors\\" and Marleen Schippers' \\"Of Monsters and Children: Re-reading Child Development to Re-write Identity,\\" to flesh out the ethical conundrums involved in the empathetic and aesthetic appropriation of a child's voice in adult fiction. Conclusion In this essay, we have attempted a comprehensive examination of the dual function of child narrators in 20th century adult literature. Firstly, we have argued that the choice of a child narrator opens up a creative space wherein the seemingly mundane world is lit up with fantastical possibilities. Secondly, we have shown how the narrative voices of child protagonists in adult fiction can engage readers, both emotionally and ethically, through the uniquely experiential accounts of their subjective worlds. Overall, we contend that the inclusion of child narrators in contemporary adult literature enriches the narrative texture and thematic complexity, even as it reminds adult readers of the vast, wonder-laden horizons integral to their own previously innocent perspectives."},{"prompt":"JavaCV将图片转为视频","completion":"以下是JavaCV将图片转为视频的一个简单示例代码： \`\`\`java import org.bytedeco.javacv.*;

Use less passive voice. Refrain from using long sentences (over 20 words per sentence). Use headings and list","completion":"Title: Blackout Tattoos - The Enigmatic World That Reflects Self-Expression Introduction Blackout tattoos have gained enormous popularity in the past few years among body art enthusiasts and tattoo culture aficionados. These bold, impressive tattoos represent an intriguing way of self-expression as they use a massive amount of ink to cover large portions of the body in solid black color. But what exactly is a blackout tattoo? What goes into the process, and who chooses to get them? This article will dive deep into the world of blackout tattoos to explore the meaning, method, and mindset behind these unique artistic expressions. Why Choose a Blackout Tattoo? There are a multitude of reasons why people choose to go for blacked-out body art. Some of the most common motivations are: 1. Cover-ups: A significant portion of those who choose blackout tattoos do so to conceal unwanted, poorly done, or regretted tattoos. A blackout tattoo creates a clean, solid black canvas that can either stand on its own or serve as a backdrop for future tattoos with bright colors and bold designs. 2. Aesthetic Appeal: Some people simply appreciate the look of blackout tattoos. The bold, solid black designs can make a powerful statement and create eye-catching contrast against the skin. 3. Emotional Healing: Tattoos have long been used as a form of emotional expression and healing. Blackout tattoos can symbolize the closing of a difficult chapter or be a reminder of one's strength and resilience in overcoming personal struggles. 4. Cultural and Spiritual Significance: In certain cultures and spiritual practices, blackout tattoos hold specific meaning and significance. For instance, in ancient Polynesian tribal culture, black was a color associated with strength, protection, and power. Understanding the Blackout Tattoo Process The process of creating a blackout tattoo is both meticulous and painstaking. It entails the following steps: 1. Consultation: Just like any other tattoo, a client must first consult with their chosen tattoo artist about the design, size, placement, and overall goals of the tattoo. It is crucial to discuss all aspects of the process and ensure both parties understand each other's expectations. 2. Preparation: After finalizing the design, the artist meticulously cleans and shaves the area to be tattooed. The process demands both mental and physical preparation, as the time and pain endured during a blackout tattoo can be considerable. 3. Stencil Placement: Depending on the tattoo design, the artist might use a stencil or draw a rough outline of the desired shape before starting the inking process. 4. Tattooing: The blackout ink is applied using a tattoo machine with either a magnum or round shader needle. The artist takes immense care to ensure an even application of ink, often going over an area multiple times to reach complete saturation. It is essential to have an artist experienced in this technique, as poor application can result in uneven and patchy tattoos that require touch-ups and rework. 5. Aftercare: Just like any other tattoo, proper aftercare is critical to the healing and longevity of a blackout tattoo. Following standard aftercare protocols - such as keeping the tattoo clean, applying the appropriate ointment, avoiding direct sunlight, and avoiding submersion in water - is crucial for preventing complications and enjoying a high-quality tattoo. The Fascinating Appeal of Negative Space Tattoos A significant subset of blackout tattoos is the extraordinary world of negative space tattoos. These designs are created by using the natural skin tone as the design itself and surrounding it with solid black ink. This innovative approach creates an almost ethereal appearance that can be breathtaking when done by skilled artists. One popular type of negative space tattoo is the negative space sleeve or leg piece. This particular design covers the entire arm or leg, leaving strategic gaps in the black ink to create intricate patterns, shapes, or even recognizable images. These tattoos require a highly skilled hand and a deep understanding of the balance between positive (inked) and negative (un-inked) space. The Debate Surrounding Blackout Tattoos Despite their growing popularity, blackout tattoos have also faced criticism and controversy within the tattoo community. The following are some of the points of contention: 1. Concerns over Tattoo Removal: Due to the sheer amount of ink used, removing a blackout tattoo can be substantially more challenging and expensive than traditional tattoos. Although laser removal technology has advanced, tattoo removal can still be a painful, lengthy, and costly process. 2. Health Concerns: Black tattoo ink contains various pigments, with carbon black being the most prevalent. There are concerns about the potential long-term health effects of large amounts of black ink, such as allergic reactions or heavy metal poisoning. It is crucial to research and use high-quality, reputable ink to minimize the risk of complications. 3. Cultural Appropriation: Some critics argue that blackout tattoos may constitute cultural appropriation when the person getting the tattoo does not possess an understanding or respect for the cultures and practices that originated these art forms. Despite the controversies and debates, it is undeniable that blackout tattoos have carved a niche in the world of body art and self-expression. As with any form of art or creative expression, understanding the history, technique, and cultural significance behind blackout tattoos is key to fully appreciating the medium. In the end, a tattoo is a deeply personal choice, and a blackout tattoo can be a powerful symbol of courage, strength, resilience, and self-expression for those who choose to embrace its bold aesthetics."},{"prompt":"小米手环8三个圈代表什么意思啊","completion":"小米手环8的三个圈分别是运动圈、心率圈和训练圈。 - 运动圈：用于显示用户每天的步数和卡路里消耗情况，能够激励用户增加每天的运动量。 - 心率圈：用于监测用户每天的心率情况，能够及时掌握自己的健康状况。 - 训练圈：用于记录用户每天进行的运动训练，帮助用户科学地进行运动锻炼，提高锻炼效果。"},{"prompt":"1350w电源是用在哪个工作站","completion":"一般来说，1350W电源用于高性能工作站、服务器或者矿机等需要大量计算和功耗的设备。例如，需要装配多个GPU显卡或者需要大量运行CPU处理器的工作站或者服务器。这样的电源一般都具有高效率、高质量的电路设计和散热系统，满足高功率、长时间的稳定工作需求。"},{"prompt":"白锆款什么意思","completion":"在手机领域中，通常所说的“白锆”是指手机的材质，属于一种特殊的陶瓷材质。它能够使手机呈现出非常好看的高端质感，同时具有很强的抗摔、耐用、防刮、不易生锈的特点。因此，很多高端手机都采用了白锆材质。在此基础上，有些手机厂商还推出了“白锆版”或者“白锆限量版”，代表着手机的档次和品质更高。总之，“白锆款”通常就是指使用了白锆材质的手机产品。"},{"prompt":"格力8位homekit代码在哪","completion":"格力空调的Homekit代码通常在产品说明书中附带，可以在安装和使用说明书中寻找Homekit代码。另外，你也可以通过以下步骤获取: 1. 在空调面板上按下“menu”键并保持3秒，直到屏幕上出现“D”字样。 2. 使用遥控器选择空调的“wifi设置”选项，进入配网模式。 3. 下载并打开Home APP，在添加配件菜单中选择“添加配件”。 4. 扫描空调内显示屏中的二维码，如果二维码失效，则选择“无法扫描”选项，进入手动添加配件的界面。 5. 输入空调对应的Homekit代码，并按照步骤完成空调配对。 注意，不同型号的格力空调Homekit代码可能不同，需要根据具体情况进行查询和操作。"},{"prompt":"华为资源池排序依据","completion":"华为资源池排序的依据一般包括：CPU、内存、磁盘容量、网络带宽、IO性能等指标。具体来说，可以按照以下几个方面进行排序： 1.

Но я знал, что не могу им доверять. 17 июня я услышал рёв и медленные громкие шаги, которые приближались ко мне. Позже мне удалось понять, что это были Потрошители - существа похожие на деформированных животных с ростом около 3 метров. Уже на следующий день один из них проник ко мне в дом. Я понимал, что долго не выживу, поэтому быстро выпрыгнул в окно и побежал в лес, где меня окружили жуткие звуки и голоса. Прошло уже несколько лет, но я до сих пор помню этот кошмарный период моей жизни. Почти потерял свое человеческое \\"Я\\", но благодаря своей выжившей душе я продолжаю жить. Мне приходится бороться с кошмарами и тяжелыми воспоминаниями каждый день, но я знаю одно - я выжил и сейчас могу смело смотреть в глаза любой опасности."},{"prompt":"Добавь 10 источников к списку использованной литературы на тему \\"Портреты монархов в творчестве Рубенса и Веласкеса\\"","completion":"1.

You haven't provided the full code for initializing the VkPipelineRasterizationStateCreateInfo, VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo, and VkPipelineColorBlendStateCreateInfo structs, which could be the issue. Make sure you've provided correct values for those structures in \`CreateGraphicsPipeline()\`. Assuming that you filled the structs mentioned above correctly, I'll suggest another potential fix, which may be related to the Vulkan validation layers. They often provide useful information regarding the access violation errors. First, make sure you've set up and enabled Vulkan validation layers in your project. You can use the following code to do that inside Renderer.cpp: \`\`\`cpp const std::vector<const char*> validationLayers = { \\"VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation\\" }; // Enable validation layers during development. #ifdef NDEBUG const bool enableValidationLayers = false; #else const bool enableValidationLayers = true; #endif // Check if validation layers are supported. bool CheckValidationLayerSupport() { uint32_t layerCount; vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties(&layerCount, nullptr); std::vector<VkLayerProperties> availableLayers(layerCount); vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties(&layerCount, availableLayers.data()); for (const char* layerName : validationLayers) { bool layerFound = false; for (const auto& layerProperties : availableLayers) { if (strcmp(layerName, layerProperties.layerName) == 0) { layerFound = true; break; } } if (!layerFound) { return false; } } return true; } // Modify CreateInstance() method to enable validation layers. void Renderer::CreateInstance() { if (enableValidationLayers && !CheckValidationLayerSupport()) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"Validation layers requested but not available.\\"); } // ... instanceCreateInfo.enabledLayerCount = enableValidationLayers ? static_cast<uint32_t>(validationLayers.size()) : 0; instanceCreateInfo.ppEnabledLayerNames = enableValidationLayers ? validationLayers.data() : nullptr; // ... } \`\`\` If validation layers are enabled, try running your code through a debugger to see if it generates any error messages. Make sure to check the console output for any relevant error messages that may provide more insight into the cause of the access violation. You can also try using the Vulkan Debug Report, which can be more descriptive and provide information regarding API usage errors. To use the Vulkan Debug Report, you need to install the Vulkan SDK if you haven't already done so. Here's how to create a debug report: 1. Download and install the Vulkan SDK from the official website: https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home 2. Set up your project to use the Vulkan SDK (you may need to add necessary include paths and define the \`VK_USE_PLATFORM_WIN32_KHR\` macro depending on your chosen installation method). 3. Add the VK_EXT_debug_report extension and enable the debug report. \`\`\`cpp const uint32_t kMaxFramesInFlight = 2; const VkAllocationCallbacks* kAllocationCallbacks = nullptr; VKAPI_ATTR VkBool32 VKAPI_CALL DebugReportCallback( VkDebugReportFlagsEXT msgFlags, VkDebugReportObjectTypeEXT objType, uint64_t srcObject, size_t location, int32_t msgCode, const char* pLayerPrefix, const char* pMsg, void* pUserData) { if (msgFlags & VK_DEBUG_REPORT_ERROR_BIT_EXT) { std::cerr << pLayerPrefix << \\": \\" << pMsg << std::endl; } return VK_FALSE; } VkResult CreateDebugReportCallbackEXT(VkInstance instance, const VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT* pCreateInfo, const VkAllocationCallbacks* pAllocator, VkDebugReportCallbackEXT* pCallback) { auto func = (PFN_vkCreateDebugReportCallbackEXT)vkGetInstanceProcAddr(instance, \\"vkCreateDebugReportCallbackEXT\\"); if (func != nullptr) { return func(instance, pCreateInfo, pAllocator, pCallback); } else { return VK_ERROR_EXTENSION_NOT_PRESENT; } } void Renderer::CreateInstance() { // ... instanceCreateInfo.enabledExtensionCount = static_cast<uint32_t>(extensionNames.size() + 1); auto debugReportExtension = VK_EXT_DEBUG_REPORT_EXTENSION_NAME; std::vector<const char*> extensionsWithDebugReport(extensionNames.size() + 1); for (size_t i = 0; i < extensionNames.size(); ++i) { extensionsWithDebugReport[i] = extensionNames[i]; } extensionsWithDebugReport.back() = debugReportExtension; instanceCreateInfo.ppEnabledExtensionNames = extensionsWithDebugReport.data(); if (vkCreateInstance(&instanceCreateInfo, kAllocationCallbacks, &instance) != VK_SUCCESS) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"Failed to create a Vulkan instance.\\"); } VkDebugReportCallbackCreateInfoEXT createInfo = {}; createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEBUG_REPORT_CREATE_INFO_EXT; createInfo.flags = VK_DEBUG_REPORT_ERROR_BIT_EXT | VK_DEBUG_REPORT_WARNING_BIT_EXT | VK_DEBUG_REPORT_PERFORMANCE_WARNING_BIT_EXT; createInfo.pfnCallback = Debug_RecieveDebugMessage; if (CreateDebugReportCallbackEXT(instance, &createInfo, kAllocationCallbacks, &debugReport) != VK_SUCCESS) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"Failed to create a Vulkan debug callback!\\"); } }\` \`\`\` Again, check the console output to see if a more detailed error message is available which might provide insight into the access violation.

Грозовые облака над головой уже давно не расходились, и воздух был холодным и влажным. Я уже давно перестал смотреть на новости, потому что они всегда были одинаковыми - выживай как можешь, не двигайся, не говори и не включай свет. Сегодня я слышал, как вдалеке начали кричать люди. Я затаился еще глубже, прячущийся в углу комнаты. Я молился на то, что они найдут спасение, и что мне никогда не придется выходить на улицу. На следующий день все каналы показывали стратегии выживания снова. Я приготовился к ящику с гречкой и слушал, как говорил диктор. \\"Если вы слышите крик, не пойдите в его сторону.\\" Я зажался. Но тут на мою дверь стукнули. Я инстинктивно затянулся в свитер и приблизился к двери. С той стороны двери был голос. \\"Помогите ... мне нужна ваша помощь.\\" Голос звучал знакомо ... человечный. Но я знал, что это могли быть Гиганты, имитирующие человеческую речь. Я захватил нож и двинулся к двери. Ничего не было видно сквозь дверь, так что я решил, что если это действительно мой сосед, то он должен знать пароль. \\"Ты знаешь пароль?\\" \\"Да, да, конечно же!\\" Но я решил не рисковать, и послал его прочь, слыша, как он ушел. Потом я услышал рычание вдали, кажется, кто-то кричал что-то издалека. На следующий день я услышал, как снаружи моего окна были шаги. Я подполз к окну и увидел контуры двухметровых фигур - они были Призывателями. Они встали, смотря на меня через окно, и я инстинктивно отошел в сторону. Внезапно один из Призывателей неуклюже стучал в мою дверь, продолжая имитировать человеческую речь. Он просил помощи. Я был побежден: я открыл дверь. Через несколько дней я услышал тот же голос, где-то вдали. Я знал, что это мертвый ход, что это может быть ловушкой, но я не мог противостоять. Я вышел из дома, медленно приближаясь к источнику звука. Где-то вдалеке я увидел Здоровенного Гиганта, спокойно проходящего мимо меня и сжимающего свои кровавые зубы, извергая страшный рев. Тогда я услышал нечто еще. Когда я повернул голову, то увидел огромное монструозное существо на сто метров. Потрошители, они были деформированными животными и растами около трех метров. Они начали вламываться в мой дом, и я понимал, что у меня не будет шансов. Я ухватил сверло для беседки, поднялся на второй этаж и прорубил окно. Я перепрыгнул через него, махнув на прощание срубившим меня Призывателям. Я бежал, не думая, пытаясь убежать от этих тварей. Я мчался сквозь глухой лес, и перепрыгивал бродившие трясинки, но я услышал жуткие звуки. Но то, что я услышал в конце, привело меня к полнейшему отчаянию. Глубоко в лесу орала непонятная тварь, издавая своеобразный рёв. Я понимал, что мой конец настал. Я открыл свое затылок и пустил из рук сверло, которое улетело за мною, бесцельно цепляя за безопасным местом. Я закрыл глаза и ждал. И это был конец."},{"prompt":"Ты врач травматолог ортопед.

Сначала следует обратиться к гастроэнтерологу и получить рекомендации о лечении гастрита. Возможно, сначала потребуется провести курс консервативного лечения для стабилизации состояния пациента. Во время обследования также учитываются результаты лабораторных исследований (кровь, моча, биохимия) и инструментальных методов (рентген, МРТ, УЗИ). Таким образом, решение о проведении операции будет основано на индивидуальной оценке состояния пациента и его потенциальной выгоде от хирургического вмешательства, по сравнению с рисками, связанными с возможными осложнениями и плохим течением гастрита.

He is skilled in a variety of different fighting styles, including hand-to-hand combat, firearms, and martial arts. He has extensive experience in fighting against extraterrestrial threats and has faced tough and advanced opponents in the Half-Life game series.

In terms of ranged combat, Adrian is known as a skilled marksman with experience in gunfights against advanced extraterrestrial threats. Brandon is also highly skilled in using guns and has proven his prowess with them in fighting walker hordes, human enemies, and the Whisperers. Ultimately, in a straight-up hand-to-hand combat fight, Adrian might have the upper hand due to his extensive combat training and martial arts skills.

It all depends on the scenario of the encounter, the weapons available, and the willingness of each character to use them."},{"prompt":"But Adrian is more experience at guns than Brandon","completion":"You're right. Adrian Shephard has more experience in using firearms compared to Brandon Carver. Adrian has experience fighting against extraterrestrial threats, which means he has encountered various types of advanced weapons during his battles.

However, Brandon has shown great skill in using guns in the zombie apocalypse, using various strategies and tactics to take down his enemies. He has also used melee weapons, such as knives and machetes, in situations where firearms were unavailable or not practical. Overall, both Adrian and Brandon have experience using firearms, but Adrian's experience might give him the edge in a gunfight.

Here's how it might go: Round 1: Firearms Battle The two fighters take cover behind abandoned cars in a deserted street littered with debris from the zombie apocalypse. Adrian and Brandon both take out their guns and prepare to engage each other in a gunfight. Adrian has experience fighting against advanced extraterrestrial threats and has used various types of firearms during his missions. He aims his rifle and takes careful shots at Brandon's direction, taking advantage of the environment to gain a clear shot. Brandon is fast, agile, and takes cover quickly, using the available debris as cover to evade Adrian's fire. He pops out every few moments to take quick shots at Adrian. Adrian is determined and focused; he knows the stakes are high, so he readjusts his aim and waits patiently for his moment to strike. Brandon is quick on his feet, but Adrian is more precise and has a lot of experience with advanced weapons. He shoots accurately, taking down pieces of debris and narrowing down Brandon's options. Brandon manages to shoot a few rounds back, but he misses or can't manage to hit Adrian with precision. After a few minutes of firing back and forth, Adrian wins the round. His experience and his calm and collected nature give him the edge over Brandon. He takes the final shot, hitting Brandon in the shoulder and causing him to bleed out. Brandon, injured, surrenders the fight to Adrian. In conclusion, Adrian Shephard wins the firearms round, owing to his extensive experience using different types of firearms. He is more precise than Brandon Carver and can use tactics to gain a clear shot. However, it's worth noting that the outcome of the fight still depends on various factors, the story you're telling and the specific details you include in the scene."},{"prompt":"Make a Round 2 to see who would win in a straight-up hand-to-hand combat fight.","completion":"Sure, let's imagine another scenario where Adrian Shephard and Brandon Carver face each other in a straight-up hand-to-hand combat fight. Here's how it might go: Round 2: Hand-to-Hand Combat Adrian Shephard and Brandon Carver put their guns aside and face each other for a hand-to-hand combat fight. They both know that this is going to be intense. Adrian draws from his military training and martial arts experience, while Brandon relies on his marine combat training and street fighting. Both men approach each other cautiously, waiting for the right moment to strike. The fight begins, and they both exchange blows, moving around the abandoned building in which they are fighting. Adrian's form and techniques are impressive, and he delivers precise and calculated punches, kicks, and jabs. Brandon tries to match his opponent's movement, but Adrian proves too difficult to anticipate, evading his attacks and striking back. Despite his immense skill, Adrian takes a few hits from Brandon's punches. Once or twice Brandon manages to get in close enough to deliver a good hit, but Adrian's armor and endurance keep him in the fight. Adrian seems unphased by the blows, focusing on his military training that has taught him to push through the pain. He begins to take the upper hand, delivering quick and powerful strikes to Brandon that seem to slow him down and eventually knock him down. In the end, Adrian is the clear winner of this round. His extensive training and experience in hand-to-hand combat and martial arts allow him to overcome Brandon's skills. He manages to keep his focus, stay calm and collected, and apply his techniques without hesitation. Brandon, while a skilled opponent, ultimately can’t match Adrian's expert hand-to-hand combat skills. In conclusion, Adrian Shephard emerges victorious in the hand-to-hand combat round, owing to his extensive experience and training in both hand-to-hand combat and martial arts.

The fight begins, and both men move around the small room, trying to deliver fatal blows to each other. Adrian makes use of his martial arts expertise to deliver precise and powerful strikes at Brandon, while Brandon relies on his street-fighting expertise to find openings and get in close. The room is dark and filled with debris, making the fight even more challenging. With the limited space available, both men struggle to land the finishing moves that would end the fight. Adrian's training and martial arts expertise enable him to evade most of Brandon's attacks and strike back with short-range kicks and punches. In contrast, Brandon's street-fighting experience enables him to deliver brutal attacks that push Adrian back several feet. The fight goes back and forth until Adrian gains the upper hand. Utilizing his military training and fighting experience, Adrian manages to disarm Brandon and get a hold of Brandon's machete. With a swift and powerful motion, Adrian delivers a fatal blow to Brandon, ending the fight. In conclusion, Adrian emerges as the clear winner in the close-quarters combat round.

Additionally, Negan's psychological warfare skills could prove to be an effective tool against Shephard, who may not be as experienced in dealing with such tactics. Overall, the outcome of this battle would likely depend on the context of the confrontation. If Shephard were to catch Negan off guard, he could potentially take him down with a well-placed bullet or grenade. However, if Negan were to have the element of surprise or if the fight came down to a close-quarters brawl, he could use his strength to overpower Shephard and deal a crushing blow with Lucille."},{"prompt":"仿照杨氏之子中孔指以示儿曰:“此是君家果。”这句话在写一种水果开头的姓氏","completion":"。"},{"prompt":"请你解释一下什么是原非凸问题","completion":"原非凸问题是指在优化问题中，目标函数不是凸函数的情况下的问题。凸函数是指在定义域内任意两点之间的线段都在或以上函数上方的函数，而非凸函数则不满足这个条件。 在原非凸问题中，最小化（或最大化）目标函数的过程中可能存在多个极小值（或极大值），因此需要考虑如何找到全局最优解而不是局部最优解。 解决原非凸问题的方法包括贪心算法、遗传算法、模拟退火算法、粒子群算法等启发式算法，以及线性规划、半正定规划等数学优化算法。这些算法适用于不同类型的原非凸问题，因此需要根据具体问题来选择合适的算法。"},{"prompt":"请你介绍一下什么是SINR","completion":"SINR，全称为信噪比和干扰比（Signal-to-Interference plus Noise Ratio），是指无线通信中，接收信号的功率与干扰噪声的功率之比。在无线通信中，SINR 是一个重要的性能指标，它反映了接收信号的质量和抗干扰能力。 SINR 可以用下面的公式表示： SINR = (接收信号功率) / (干扰噪声功率) 其中，接收信号功率是指接收到的信号的功率，干扰噪声功率是指其他信号以及噪声对信号的干扰。 SINR 的数值越高，表示接收信号的品质越好，抗干扰能力越强，网络传输速度越快。相反，SINR 的数值越低，则表示信号质量越差，抗干扰能力越弱，网络传输速度也会变慢。 SINR 在无线通信中的应用非常广泛，包括无线网络的优化、信道估计、干扰管理、功率控制等方面，是无线通信系统设计和优化中不可或缺的重要参数。"},{"prompt":"怎么感谢答辩老师","completion":"感谢答辩老师是一个非常重要的礼仪，表示你对老师的教诲和指导感到非常感激。以下是一些方法，可以用来感谢答辩老师： 1. 发送感谢信：可以在邮件或信纸上写下你的感谢之情，表达自己的谢意。 2. 送礼物：可以送一份小礼物，如花束或巧克力，表达自己的感激和尊重。 3. 留言或签名：可以留言或请老师签名，作为对老师的感激和纪念。 4. 参加聚会：可以参加聚会或庆祝活动，与老师和同学一起庆祝。 5. 打电话：可以打电话或视频通话，表达自己的感谢之意，向老师表示感激。 最重要的是，无论是哪种方法，都要真诚、诚恳地表达自己的感激之情。"},{"prompt":"[(‘4000’, ‘8000’)], python find the largest number, excepted result is 8000","completion":"You can use the max() function to find the largest number in the list: \`\`\` lst = [('4000', '8000')] largest_number = max(lst, key=lambda x: int(x[1]))[1] print(largest_number) # Output: 8000 \`\`\` In the above code, we first define a list containing a tuple of two strings. Then we use the max() function to find the element with the largest number in the second position of the tuple. To do this, we use the key parameter of the max() function and pass a lambda function that converts the second element of each tuple to an integer before comparing them. Finally, we access the second element of the tuple with the [1] index and assign it to the largest_number variable."},{"prompt":"Напиши историю от лица человека который выживал в Холодном Конце.

Not litearlly, but I feel very energetic that I could jump around the room I'm in. I cant do it because it would be inappropriate","completion":"There are several possible reasons why you may be feeling so explosive and energetic: 1. Hormonal changes: Changes in hormones, such as an increase in adrenaline or testosterone, can lead to feelings of increased energy and explosiveness. 2. Lack of sleep: If you haven't been getting enough sleep, your body may be compensating by releasing more energy during the day to keep you awake and alert. 3. Exercise: Engaging in regular exercise can boost your energy levels and make you feel more alert and energized. 4. Stimulants: Consuming stimulants, such as caffeine or energy drinks, can increase your heart rate and give you a temporary burst of energy. 5. Psychological factors: Your explosive energy may also be due to psychological factors such as excitement, anxiety, or a sense of anticipation. It's important to remember that while feeling energetic can be a positive thing, it's also important to be able to manage and regulate your energy levels appropriately, especially in social and professional settings. If you find yourself consistently feeling explosive and unable to control your energy, it may be a good idea to speak to a healthcare professional or mental health specialist for guidance."},{"prompt":"i havent moved much all day","completion":"If you haven't moved much all day, and yet you feel very explosive and full of energy, there may be other reasons for this feeling. Some possible explanations could be: 1. Diet: Eating a meal high in sugar or carbohydrates can cause a surge of energy followed by a crash, which could lead to feeling explosive. 2. Stress: Feeling stressed or anxious can cause physical symptoms such as racing heart rate, which may give the impression of feeling unusually energetic. 3. Boredom: Sometimes when we are not mentally stimulated, we may feel restless and have a surplus of energy that needs to be expended in some way. 4. Excitement: If you are anticipating something exciting later on in the day, you may feel an increased sense of energy and excitement leading up to it. It's important to monitor your energy levels and try to find ways to channel your energy productively and appropriately. This could mean finding a physical activity to engage in if you are feeling restless, or practicing self-care techniques such as meditation or deep breathing exercises if you are feeling anxious or stressed."},{"prompt":"i have been holding it in all day","completion":"If you have been holding in your energy all day, such as by sitting at a desk or in a meeting, it's possible that you're experiencing a sudden burst of energy now that you have the opportunity to move and release that energy. This is a natural response to feeling physically constricted or restrained for an extended period. To channel this energy in a productive way, you may want to consider engaging in some physical activity, such as going for a walk or doing some stretching exercises. This can help to release the excess energy and help you feel more grounded and calm. Alternatively, you could engage in a creative or mentally stimulating activity, such as reading, writing, or brainstorming, to help channel your energy in a more focused and productive way. This can help to keep your mind occupied and prevent you from feeling restless or unfocused. It's important to remember that feeling extra energetic can be a positive thing, but it's also important to know how to manage and regulate your energy levels appropriately so that you can be productive and effective in your daily life."},{"prompt":"Переделай письмо и дополни какой то забавной историей по теме Hello dear my!

Я не знаю, когда это произойдет, но я хочу оставить свой след. Меня зовут Джошуа, я выживший Холодного Конца. Все началось с того, что наша планета была загадочно обезлюдена. Я был один в своем доме и, как и все, я начал замечать странные вещи вне моего окна. Ежедневно огромные конечности оргомных существ поднимались с неба, покрывая всю землю. Не пройдет неделя, как я начал слышать громкий рык, стоны, крики. Я не мог сразу понять, что происходит, и лишь через несколько дней узнал о гигантах. Затем появились Призыватели, и я сразу же понял, что они не друзья. Их силуэты, напоминавшие человека, вызывали у меня страх. Но кто-то у них был, ярко белый свет проникал через мою дверь. Я продолжал оставаться на охране, но когда на следующий день один из Призывателей попросил о помощи, я чуть не поверил ему. Это был обман. Крики, которые я услышал через несколько дней, были переведены моими острыми ушами на голоса Потрошителей. Я прячусь внутри своего дома, пока они ждут и проникают через мои окна. Существа, которые похожи на деформированных животных, ростом около трех метров и с отвратительными когтями. Но они были быстрыми и хитрыми. Наконец, один из Потрошителей оказался внутри моего дома. Я испугался и понял, что мои дни сочтены. Но я не мог сдаться, я не собирался просто так умереть. Я отправился через окно, где уже ждали Призыватели. Он задавал тонкие вопросы о моей жизни и о том, что я хочу узнать. Я знал, что он пытается меня соблазнить, но мое желание выжить было слишком большим. Я побежал за ним, но скоро понял свою ошибку. Я оказался в лесу, который был полон ужасных звуков, как будто весь мир сошел с ума. Я начал бегать, но это было тщетно. Потрошители были за моей спиной, буквально на следу моей пятки. Я нашел укрытие под камнем, но он был слабым. Я умолял да диким паническим крикам о помощи, и сам не зная, что же мне делать, начал записывать эту историю. Я говорю это вслух, что бы когда лицемеры приходят, они всегда оказываются только дополнением к кошмару. Их присутствие настолько страшно, что меня лучше быть нет, чем на территории, где они обитают. Я не знаю, где я сейчас, но к лицемерам и прочим Призывателям я раз и навсегда не вернусь. Вы тоже не забывайте и остерегайтесь свинцового колебания.

However, I can offer some general advice that might help you identify the issue: 1. Ensure that the Vulkan related objects like VkDevice and VkRenderPass that are passed to the Pipeline::CreateGraphicsPipeline method are properly initialized before calling the method. 2. Make sure all the fields of the VkGraphicsPipelineCreateInfo are filled in properly. In the provided code snippet, some fields like rasterizer and multisampling are commented, so ensure that they are set correctly as well. 3. Double-check that the Vulkan API is correctly set up. The error can be a result of the Vulkan API not being initialized properly, or the wrong extensions and layers are enabled for your application. 4. Remember to run your application with the Vulkan validation layers enabled. They can help find errors and issues with the Vulkan usage in your application. It's possible that validation layers will give you a clue as to what is causing the access violation. 5. Use a debugger to step through the creation process, checking variables and object handles along the way. This might reveal any uninitialized or improperly configured objects. 6. In some cases, the issue might not be directly related to the vkCreateGraphicsPipelines call. Instead, there might be a previous error in your code that causes issues in memory management, which leads to a crash when the function is called. It is essential to thoroughly inspect not just this function but all the steps leading up to this error."},{"prompt":"how do i configure 64 bit direct output framework for my pinball machine","completion":"To configure the Direct Output Framework (DOF) for your pinball machine, you need to follow these steps: 1.

I have belly fat. I want to diet. can you give me some advice about high protein food with low fat and low calorie and low cost that can help me to decrease my weight?","completion":"Sure! Incorporating high-protein, low-fat, low-calorie, and budget-friendly foods into your diet can help you lose weight, especially when combined with regular exercise. Here are some food recommendations: 1. Lean meats: Chicken breast, turkey, lean cuts of beef, or pork tenderloin are high in protein and low in fat. Opt for grilling, baking, or broiling instead of frying. 2. Fish: Tuna, salmon, and whitefish are great options for high protein and healthy fats, especially if you choose canned or frozen varieties to save on cost. 3. Legumes: Beans, lentils, and chickpeas are excellent plant-based protein sources that are also high in fiber and low in fat. 4. Eggs: Eggs are an affordable and versatile protein source. You can reduce caloric intake by using more egg whites than yolks, as egg whites are almost entirely protein. 5. Greek yogurt: Opt for plain, low-fat Greek yogurt since it's higher in protein and lower in fat and sugar than regular yogurt. 6. Cottage cheese: This dairy product is high in protein and low in fat, which makes it an ideal snack or a healthy addition to meals. 7. Quinoa: This whole grain is a good plant-based protein source and is more affordable when bought in bulk. 8. Tofu: Tofu is a cheap and versatile plant-based protein option that can be incorporated into various dishes. 9. Edamame: These immature soybeans are high in protein, low in fat, and make a great snack or side dish. 10.

Also, consult a nutritionist or dietitian for personalized advice based on your needs and preferences."},{"prompt":"how many chicken egg i can eat everyday?","completion":"The number of eggs you can eat daily depends on various factors, such as your age, activity level, overall diet, and individual health conditions. Generally, it is considered safe to consume 1-2 whole eggs per day for healthy individuals. Eggs are rich in high-quality protein, healthy fats, and essential vitamins and minerals. However, the yolk contains cholesterol, which has led to concerns over the consumption of multiple eggs daily. Recent research suggests that dietary cholesterol's impact on blood cholesterol levels varies among individuals and is not as significant as once thought. For most people, consuming moderate amounts of eggs does not increase the risk of heart diseases. If you're concerned about cholesterol intake or have been advised by a healthcare professional to limit cholesterol in your diet, you can consume more egg whites than yolks, as the egg whites are cholesterol-free and high in protein. It's essential to maintain a balanced diet with various protein sources, such as lean meats, fish, legumes, and dairy products, instead of relying solely on eggs. Please consult a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized advice on egg consumption based on your specific needs and health conditions."},{"prompt":"I am 47 years old.

Adrian Shephard is a highly-trained and skilled soldier with years of combat experience, having served in multiple missions and conflicts. He is physically fit and proficient in the use of various firearms and explosives. Shephard is also resilient, enduring significant injuries and intense combat situations during his military service. On the other hand, Negan is a former high school coach turned leader of the Saviors, a ruthless group that dominates other survivors in the Walking Dead universe. He is a cunning strategist and manipulator, using fear and intimidation to control and maintain his power. Negan is also a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, using a baseball bat named Lucille as his primary weapon. In a one-on-one fight, Shephard's military training and combat experience give him the edge when it comes to using firearms and explosives. However, Negan's mastery of hand-to-hand combat and his unpredictable fighting style could catch Shephard off guard. Negan's leadership traits and ability to manipulate others would also give him an advantage in a more extended battle, allowing him to coordinate attacks and plan out a strategy. Ultimately, it's difficult to predict the outcome of a clash between these two characters as it would depend on the conditions of the fight and the weapons involved. However, it's safe to say that both Shephard and Negan are formidable opponents, each with their unique strengths and weaknesses."},{"prompt":"Alonzo Harris (Training Day) vs. Dwight (TWD TV Series)","completion":"Alonzo Harris from Training Day and Dwight from The Walking Dead are both skilled fighters, but in very different ways. Alonzo is a corrupt police officer who uses his power and influence to get what he wants, while Dwight is a member of the Saviors, a group that terrorizes other survivors in The Walking Dead universe. Alonzo is an expert in hand-to-hand combat and knows how to wield a firearm effectively. He is willing to use any means necessary to achieve his objectives, often resorting to violence and intimidation. He is also ruthless and carries a deep-seated anger that fuels his actions. Dwight, on the other hand, is proficient in using a crossbow and a range of other weapons, with a particular fondness for his beloved barbed wire-covered baseball bat. He is a tactician, often using his wit and cunning to outsmart his enemies. Like Alonzo, he is willing to resort to violence to get what he wants, but he always has a plan in place. In a one-on-one fight, it's challenging to predict the outcome as it would depend on the terrain and the specific weapons involved. However, Alonzo's expertise in hand-to-hand combat might give him an advantage over Dwight in a fist fight, while Dwight's proficiency with a crossbow could be an issue for Alonzo at a distance. Ultimately, it's hard to say who would come out on top as both Alonzo and Dwight are ruthless and skilled fighters in their own right. However, Dwight's cunning, adaptability, and skill with weapons could potentially give him an edge over Alonzo in a fight."},{"prompt":"Make a Round 1 about who would win in a straight-up hand-to-hand combat fight.","completion":"Round 1: Hand-to-Hand Combat In a straight-up hand-to-hand combat fight, Alonzo Harris and Dwight have very different fighting styles. Alonzo is a skilled fighter who knows how to throw a punch and is not afraid to get up close and personal with his opponents. He is a strong and aggressive fighter who relies on his brute strength to overpower his enemies. Dwight, on the other hand, is a more strategic fighter who uses his wit and quick thinking to outsmart his opponents. While he is physically capable of holding his own in hand-to-hand combat, he prefers to use his weapons, such as his crossbow or bat, to take down his enemies from a safe distance. If an unarmed fight were to break out between these two characters, it could go either way. Alonzo's strength and aggression could help him overpower Dwight quickly, but Dwight's tactical mind and agility could help him dodge Alonzo's attacks and land critical blows that wear him down over time. In this round, it's a close call, but we'd have to give the edge to Alonzo for his raw physical strength and experience in close combat situations. However, Dwight's resourcefulness and tactical thinking could still make him a formidable opponent."},{"prompt":"redacta un facfiction muy parecido al manga original de sakura card captor pero mas dramatico y un poco per","completion":"Sakura Kinomoto era una joven estudiante de secundaria que vivía en la ciudad de Tomoeda.

This critical essay delves into the complexities of narrative voice and perspective in relation to the child in adult fiction of the 20th century, examining J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" and Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" among others. The study considers literary theory on this topic, exploring the implications of employing such a narrative voice in terms of both the novel's themes and the broader social and cultural contexts in which they were written. Utilizing a critical lens that is informed by the work of Roland Barthes, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Wolfgang Iser, this essay seeks to provide a sophisticated and nuanced interpretation of the child narrator and its place in adult literature. Introduction The era of 20th-century adult fiction presents a plethora of diverse narrative voices and experimental departures from established narrative conventions. One of the most intriguing narrative techniques in the novels of this period is the use of child narrators, which offers a fresh lens through which readers may perceive and examine important themes and ideas. The child narrator often blurs the line between innocence and maturity, humorously exposing the hypocrisy, contradictions, and the essential nature of the adult world. Through the child's perspective in literature, we are allowed to explore society, culture and human nature in radically new ways. This essay, by examining the literary devices employed in the presentation of child narrators in 20th-century adult literature, aims to provide a thorough critical analysis of their significance and impact. Two seminal 20th century novels that have employed child narrators to significant effect are J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (1951) and Harper Lee's \\"To Kill Mockingbird\\" (1960). These works marked a radical departure from the traditional adult novel of the time, presenting complex ideas and themes through the prism of a child protagonist. Roland Barthes and Mikhail Bakhtin provide critical frameworks that allow us to understand how the use of child narrators challenge conventional literary practices and produce innovative literary texts. Barthes' essay \\"The Death of the Author\\" posits that the concept of authorship is a limiting constraint on the interpretation of any text (Barthes, 1967). Instead, he proposes that it is the reader who constructs the meaning through a process of \\"disentangling\\" inextricable cultural codes and layers of signification. Barthes' ideas are relevant to our understanding of child narrators in 20th-century novels, as his emphasis on the reader's role in constructing meaning suggests that the choice of a child narrator is a deliberate attempt by the author to redirect the reader's engagement with the text. This redirection serves to foreground the child's perspective as a conduit for understanding the author's intentions and thematic concerns. Bakhtin's notion of heteroglossia supports the creative potential of child narrators, as he argues that competing voices or narratives within a text are essential to its meaning and vitality (Bakhtin, 1981). By incorporating a child's voice into the narrative of an adult novel, the author introduces a unique and distinct perspective that enriches the text, facilitating a more profound exploration of the complexities of human existence. Bakhtin's concept of heteroglossia allows us to broaden our understanding of the innovative effects of child narrators and their contribution to the development of 20th-century adult fiction. Analysis Holden Caulfield, the protagonist and an unreliable narrator of Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" is a disenchanted 16-year-old who rejects the adult world's superficiality and hypocrisy. Through his jaded perspective, themes of alienation, bildungsroman, and the human condition are examined with an astounding existential depth. The power of Holden's narrative voice relies heavily on his continuous oscillation between childish observations and profound insights, which seem inconsistent with his age. The choice of a child narrator enables Salinger to explore mature themes within a broader cultural, moral, and social context. As Wolfgang Iser explains, \\"the fictitious world of a novel constitutes an autonomous reality on which the imaginative acts of writer and reader converge\\" (Iser, 1974, p. 280). Holden's narrative voice, as an adolescent narrator, invites the reader to participate actively in constructing meaning and interpreting the novel's themes. In \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" Harper Lee employs the perspective of six-year-old Scout Finch to explore themes of racial injustice, moral growth, and the loss of innocence in the racially segregated American South. Scout's innocent and inquisitive nature provides a nuanced lens through which readers may discern truths beyond the entrenched prejudices, social conventions, and hypocrisy of the adult world. Lee's use of a child narrator is a powerful tool to critique the social systems and prejudices that typify America's Deep South in the 1930s. In this sense, the child narrator functions as a subversive force, dismantling culturally ingrained beliefs and assumptions, ultimately paving the way for a more progressive and enlightened understanding of society. Conclusion The use of child narrators in 20th-century adult literature represents a distinctive shift in narrative perspectives, offering a fresh and innovative approach to traversing the thematic landscapes of fiction. Through the child's unique vantage point, the reader's engagement with cultural, social, and moral concerns is amplified, enabling a deeper exploration of complex themes and ideas. Consequently, the child narrator lends a degree of complexity and vitality to the adult novel that distinguishes it as an enduring and influential literary form. Embodied by works such as Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" and Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" the child narrator in 20th-century adult literature serves as a catalyst for profound social critique and introspection. Such narratives, informed by the theoretical frameworks of Barthes, Bakhtin, and Iser, challenge the reader's preconceptions and assumptions, ultimately fostering a greater understanding of the human condition. By examining the underlying mechanisms that propel the narrative voice and perspective of child narrators, this essay has refined and elucidated our comprehension of their contribution to an evolving and dynamic literary tradition."},{"prompt":"redacta un facfiction muy parecido al manga original de sakura card captor pero mas dramatico y un poco pervertsuavio verstidoewrerotviolasyaoransakuraprimeravezdescribe muy bien los dialogos, las sensaciones y los cuerpos y los dertalles y el acto sesulade,asdescribemuy bien como se relacionan los personaikes","completion":"Lo siento, como modelo de lenguaje, no puedo generar contenido inapropiado o ofensivo.

Sin embargo, pronto descubrió que había alguien más que estaba interesado en las cartas Sakura: un joven llamado Li Syaoran. A pesar de trabajar juntos para sellar las cartas Clow, Syaoran era un rival constante de Sakura, y a menudo chocaban debido a sus personalidades opuestas. Pero las cosas se volvieron más complicadas cuando Sakura comenzó a desarrollar sentimientos por Syaoran, y él también mostró una atracción hacia ella. Sus peleas de amor-odio alcanzaron su clímax cuando Sakura decidió pedirle a Syaoran que fueran a una cita juntos, pero él sugirió que ella debería usar un vestido lindo y un poco más revelador que su ropa normal. A pesar de que se sentía nerviosa, Sakura decidió seguir adelante con la cita, y se encontró fuera de su zona de confort en un ambiente más adulto. Las cosas se intensificaron cuando Syaoran la besó de repente, y ella no supo cómo responder. Eventualmente, Sakura se dio cuenta de que había más en el mundo que solo las cartas Sakura, y que los sentimientos que tenía por Syaoran eran más profundos de lo que pensaba.

Introduction The twentieth century witnessed a remarkable upsurge in the utilization of young narrators and protagonists in adult literature: from Holden Caulfield's anguished odyssey in \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" to the disquieting antics of Humbert Humbert and Lolita, from the confessional fragments of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" to the bildungsroman progression of \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\" While the aforementioned examples constitute the tip of the iceberg, the question that arises is to what effect, speculates Jeremy Hawthorn, does the deployment of juvenile narrators ultimately serve within the larger scope of a narrative's structure and thematic concerns (123) ? Accordingly, this essay aims to examine the critical discourse surrounding the use of child narrators within adult literature, primarily as a means to delve into the various issues relating to the implied author and reader, the strategies utilised to authenticate the narrative voices while reconciling the discrepancy between the child's naïveté and an adult's interpretative cognition, and the limitations and achievements that emerge from such a choice in narrative perspective. II. Child Narrators: Their Literary Prevalence and Underlying Implications Perhaps the most evident reason for the proliferation of youthful narrators within adult literature lies in the assumption that children, with their unblemished innocence and unwavering candour, offer a refreshingly idiosyncratic, albeit genuine, vantage point, one paradoxically untainted crux of truth amidst the welter of contradictory adult perspectives. As R.D. Laing opines, the relatively unsullied voice of the child supplies an unstinting clarity, embodying, as it were, a clarion call to return to the \\"primal truth\\" and \\"ontological security\\" that transcends the sophisticated sophistry of duplicitous, nebulous adult sensibilities: it is the child, finally, who perceives the \\"unreal facade\\" that belies the ostensible mask of respectable adulthood, the ostensible reification of hypocrisy and betrayal (26). These attributes of childhood charm, purity, and perceptive incisiveness generally translate into reader empathy and identification, rendering the child narrator – or focaliser, in the terms of Gerard Genette – an ideal vehicle for the intricate net of symbiosis between writer, narrator, text, and reader (De Winter 177). Yet, in light of the above, the pivotal question that emerges, as David Quentin succinctly posits, is whether the child narrator, for all its apparent transparency and guilelessness, ever truly reaches the reader innocently, disregardless of any mediation on the part of an implied adult author (98). Indeed, the difficulty lies not in reconciling the apparent sincerity of the child's voice with the specious sophistication of the ‘official’ adult discourse, but rather, in convincingly connoting an unequivocal youthful genuineness without aesthetic contrivance, deliberate manipulation, or perfunctory sentimentality. Such literary exigencies, in turn, complicate the projected relationship between the implied author and the narrating child, whom Mikhail Bakhtin categorizes as the \\"chronotope of the child\\": a \\"temporal-spatial realm,\\" where \\"the author comes face to face with [the] ontological challenge[s]\\" – that is, the \\"social ideology\\" that imposes certain roles on the adult – \\"but cannot openly posit it, thus employing the narrating child as a subversive, emancipatory weapon in a tug of war for the reader's sympathies\\" (1050). In light of such a potentially fraught relationship between the author and the child narrator, scholars such as James Kincaid and Susan Honeyman hybridize the theoretical frameworks of both narrative theory and psychoanalysis, while John Stephens extends the approach of Structuralism to delve into the variable hermeneutic codes embedded within the text’s infrastructure, thereby grounding the issue of child narrators within a wider discourse of cogent contemporaneity (109-115). In doing so, these critics not only attribute new dimensions of depth to the subject matter but also expose the fundamental intricacies involved in achieving a thorough and convincing comprehension of the intricacies and implications associated with the employment of young characters in adult literature. III. Strategies of Authentification and Their Entailed Limitations: The Voice of the Child Narrator Since a majority of the child narrators in twentieth-century literature tend to be verbally and imaginatively precocious – at once gifted and hyper-articulate – the tactics deployed by implied adult authors to authenticate the child's voice necessarily entail a delicate balancing act between naïveté and erudition. Virginia Woolf, for instance, describes young James Ramsay in \\"To the Lighthouse\\" as \\"a vision of childhood that is at once preternaturally bright and clear, anxiously kaleidoscopic in its shifting definition of objects,\\" embracing, as it were, a cross-fertilization of the 'unfathomable' and the 'sublime,' the 'ordinary' and the 'immanent,' while accommodating the particular exigencies and curiosities of a child's viewpoint (79). Indeed, the novelist's portrayal of the juvenile protagonist highlights the complexity of the inner self, a complexity that proliferates, rather than diminishes, as one advances further into the labyrinthine folds of the narrative. The effectiveness of this approach, however, hinges upon the harmonious compatibility between the narrator's youthful character and the sophisticated language he or she employs, a compatibility that signifies – emblematically, even allegorically – the interplay between the world of the child and the world of the adult. When this necessary equilibrium is neglected or subverted, the voice of the child protagonist may come across as implausible, distracting, or even contrived, effectively undermining the overall credibility of the narrative.╝"},{"prompt":"redacta el siguiente episodio de este facfiction muy parecido al manga original de sakura card captor pero mas dramatico y un poco pervertsuavio verstidoewrerotviolasyaoransakuraprimeravezdescribe muy bien los dialogos, las sensaciones y los cuerpos y los dertalles y el acto sesulade,asdescribemuy bien como se relacionan los personaikesdepraion","completion":"Lo siento, como modelo de lenguaje AI creo que el contenido que me ha pedido se inclina demasiado hacia un tono inapropiado e irrespetuoso hacia los personajes y la temática en general.

It holds enormous potential to improve economic growth, productivity, and quality of life in developing countries. However, the rapid and widespread adoption of AI has also raised numerous issues and challenges, particularly in governing AI in developing countries that may lack the necessary legal, regulatory, and ethical frameworks to mitigate the risks associated with AI. This background paper aims to provide an overview of the key issues and challenges related to governing AI in developing countries and set the context for the workshop titled \\"Governing AI in Developing Countries: Issues and Challenges.\\" The workshop will bring together policymakers, academics, civil society, and industry representatives to discuss strategies for building capacity and developing legal and regulatory frameworks for governing AI in developing countries. Issues and Challenges 1. Lack of relevant and comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks: Developing countries often have limited or outdated legal and regulatory frameworks to govern AI. In some cases, there are no specific laws or regulations addressing AI or AI-related technologies. This creates a significant gap in AI governance, potentially leading to unintended consequences, ethical breaches, and the abuse of AI technologies. 2. Inadequate capacity and resources: Many developing countries may lack the necessary capacity and resources to develop and implement the legal, ethical, and policy frameworks necessary to govern AI effectively. These countries may face difficulties in acquiring skilled personnel, technology infrastructure, and financial resources required to develop and enforce these frameworks. 3. Ethical considerations: Developing countries must consider various ethical issues in AI implementation, such as fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and human rights. Addressing these considerations is essential to ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed in ways that respect human rights and social norms. 4. Potential exacerbation of existing inequalities: The rapid adoption of AI may lead to further polarization of wealth and resources in developing countries, leaving disadvantaged groups behind. Failing to provide inclusive access to AI technologies and benefits can worsen existing economic, social, and digital inequalities. 5. Multi-stakeholder collaboration: Collaborations between government, industry, academia, and civil society are crucial to developing comprehensive and effective AI governance frameworks. However, this can be challenging in developing countries, where stakeholders may have limited experience working together or different priorities and interests. Strategies and Solutions To address these challenges and create a conducive environment for the responsible development and deployment of AI in developing countries, the following strategies and solutions can be considered: 1. Developing comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks: Policymakers in developing countries should prioritize the development of legal and regulatory frameworks tailored to their local contexts and conditions. These frameworks should address key issues such as data protection, privacy, algorithmic transparency, accountability, and ethical considerations. 2. Building capacity and resources: Developing countries should invest in building capacity and resources to support AI innovations and governance. This may include training and education programs to develop skilled personnel, infrastructure development to support AI technologies, and funding mechanisms to facilitate AI innovation and implementation. 3. Fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration: Developing countries should encourage and support partnerships between government, industry, academia, and civil society to develop AI governance frameworks collaboratively. This involves facilitating dialogue and sharing best practices among various stakeholders to identify common goals, challenges, and potential solutions. 4. Prioritizing ethical considerations: Policymakers and stakeholders in developing countries should address ethical considerations in the development and deployment of AI technologies. This may involve incorporating ethical principles and guidelines in AI policymaking, encouraging responsible data practices by industry players, and promoting awareness and education among the public. 5. Ensuring inclusive access to AI benefits: To avoid exacerbating existing inequalities, efforts should be made to ensure that the benefits and opportunities offered by AI technologies are accessible to all citizens, particularly disadvantaged and marginalized groups. This may include targeted policies, programs, and investments to promote digital literacy, skill development, infrastructure, and access to AI technologies among these groups. Conclusion Developing countries stand to benefit significantly from the responsible implementation of AI technologies. However, several issues and challenges must be addressed to govern AI effectively and minimize its potential risks. The workshop on \\"Governing AI in Developing Countries: Issues and Challenges\\" aims to facilitate dialogue and collaboration among key stakeholders and identify potential solutions for AI governance in developing countries. Through such initiatives, stakeholders can work collaboratively to harness the potential of AI for sustainable development and contribute to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."},{"prompt":"mwar3 jass Interpreter","completion":"Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I don't have access to specific software installations on any particular system.

However, I will provide some directions and questions to help you investigate the issue: 1. Make sure the \`device\` object is properly initialized and is not \`VK_NULL_HANDLE\`, as it is used in \`vkCreateGraphicsPipelines\`. Otherwise, this could lead to an access violation error. 2. Check that all the other parameters in \`pipelineCreateInfo\` are properly filled out or initialized, not null, and don't have incorrect values. 3. Check that you have properly initialized Vulkan and created required objects in the correct order. For example, - Vulkan instance - Physical device - Logical device - Surface - Swapchain - Render pass - Pipeline layout 4. Make sure you have properly waited and synchronized the graphics device when needed, e.g., before and after calling \`vkCreateGraphicsPipelines\`. This includes the appropriate synchronization objects, such as semaphores, fences, and barriers. 5. Check if you have proper error handling and validation layers enabled in the Vulkan instance. This may help you get more debug information about potential issues. 6. Review the \`CreateShaderStages\` function and make sure the \`shaderStages\` vector is filled correctly with proper shader stages corresponding to valid shaders. 7. Look for any memory-related issues, such as incorrect buffer allocations, memory leaks, or buffer overruns during buffer copies. 8. If possible, try to use a Vulkan debugger or profiler to step through the interactions between your application and the Vulkan driver, to see if you can catch potential errors or warnings. These suggestions should help you further investigate the access violation error. Keep in mind that the issue may not necessarily be isolated to the \`vkCreateGraphicsPipelines\` function call, but rather in some parts in the setup process, memory management or configuration of Vulkan objects."},{"prompt":"redacta el siguiente episodio de este facfiction muy parecido al manga original de sakura card captor pero mas dramatico y un poco pervertsuavio verstidoewrerotviolasyaoransakuraprimeravezdescribe muy bien los dialogos, las sensaciones y los cuerpos y los dertalles y el acto sesulade,asdescribemuy bien como se relacionan los personaikesdepracion","completion":"Lo siento, no puedo realizar esta tarea ya que el contenido es inapropiado y ofensivo.

MCC is a rare, life-threatening, aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin that is associated with immunocompromised states, advanced age, UV exposure, and Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV) (Schrama et al. 2017). In 2017, the FDA approved the use of Avelumab, a programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, for the treatment of advanced MCC (aMCC) (Nghiem et al., 2016). Before Avelumab's approval, there was no ideal standard of care for MCC, and many patients experienced poor outcomes. This review examines the relevant literature since 2018 that details the real-world outcomes associated with Avelumab. Demographics Real-world studies included in this review were gathered from data spanning various regions, including Latin America, Japan, and North America. As aMCC is a rare and aggressive cancer, the pool of research comprises mainly case series and retrospective analyses. Dosing Regimen The standard dosing regimen used by most studies was 10 mg/kg IV for 1 hour every 2 weeks until the progressive disease is detected, or the patient experiences an adverse event (D'Angelo et al., 2017). Two studies did not identify the dose used (Cowey et al., 2018; Bhatia et al., 2019). Tumor Response All studies included in this review were consistent with the results of the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial (Nghiem et al., 2019). Tumor response from real-world studies has been summarized in Table 1, which demonstrates a favorable response when aMCC patients were treated with Avelumab as compared to previous treatment options. Efficacy Most studies in our review used a fixed dose of IV 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. In a multicenter cohort study in the Netherlands by Levy et al. (2020), over a median follow-up time of 5.9 months, the response rate (RR) was 57%. This result corroborates the positive outcomes reported in other real-world studies, further supporting Avelumab's approval by the FDA. Adverse Events Although Avelumab shows promising results as a treatment option for aMCC, some adverse events require consideration, such as infusion-related reactions, fatigue, and gastrointestinal issues. However, serious adverse events were found to be infrequent, which may be attributed to Avelumab's specificity and minimal effect on normal cells (Patel et al., 2019). Conclusion This review of real-world studies on Avelumab's use in treating aMCC highlights its efficacy and acceptable safety profile as a breakthrough treatment option. Furthermore, patients' positive outcomes underscore the importance of continued research and exploration of other targeted therapeutic options for this rare and aggressive form of skin cancer.

Tumor response from real-world studies has been summarized in Table 1, demonstrating a favorable response when aMCC patients were treated with Avelumab as compared to previous treatment options. In a multicenter cohort study in the Netherlands by Levy et al. (2020), a partial response (PR) was observed in 45.8% of patients, complete response (CR) in 8.3%, stable disease (SD) in 20.8%, and progressive disease (PD) in 25% of patients. Similarly, in a case series by Bhatia et al. (2019), four out of five patients experienced a clinical benefit with a best overall response of two CRs, one PR, and one SD, and one PD. In another study, D'Angelo et al. (2017) found that early objective response to Avelumab treatment is associated with improved overall survival in patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. These studies collectively underscore the efficacy of Avelumab in eliciting a tumor response. Efficacy Most studies in our review used a fixed dose of IV 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The multicenter cohort study conducted in the Netherlands by Levy et al. (2020) found a disease control rate (DCR) of 66.7% and a response rate (RR) of 57% over a median follow-up time of 5.9 months. In the single institution case series by Bhatia et al. (2019), the clinical benefit rate was 80%. A retrospective analysis of the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial showed early objective responses to Avelumab treatment predicted improved overall survival in metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma patients (D'Angelo et al., 2017). Together, these studies emphasize the effectiveness of Avelumab in treating aMCC patients. Adverse Events Although Avelumab shows promising results as a treatment option for aMCC, some adverse events require consideration. According to the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial, the most common adverse events (AEs) of any grade were fatigue (23.7%), infusion-related reactions (18.4%), and nausea (15.8%) (Kaufman et al., 2018). The trial also reported that grade 3 or higher AEs occurred in 33% of patients, with the most frequent being autoimmune hepatitis (3.7%), elevated liver enzymes (2.6%), and infusion-related reactions (2.6%). In the study by Levy et al. (2020), 41.6% of patients experienced AEs, and Bhatia et al. (2019) reported manageable immune-related AEs such as pruritus and thyrotoxicosis, and no treatment discontinuation due to side effects. Although these adverse events are noteworthy, they are relatively infrequent and can be managed effectively in most cases, which may be attributed to Avelumab's specificity and minimal effect on normal cells (Patel et al., 2019).

In the 20th century, novelists drew on the symbolism, complexities, and questions that childhood and the adolescent experience raise when broaching the liminal space that exists between the worlds of the adult and the child. As Maisie, the precocious protagonist of Henry James's classic novel \\"What Maisie Knew\\" (1897), navigates the bewildering realm of adult misunderstandings and heartbreak, she represents the archetypal child-in-adult-fiction figure who \\"makes the strange familiar and the familiar strange\\" (Erica Hateley 2003, 65). Indeed, this conflation between innocence and experience, between childhood naiveté and the corrosive potential of adult consciousness provide the adult reader with a unique perspective and illuminate the wider social, political, and historical dimensions of adult fiction. This research essay aims to undertake a critical analysis of such child narrators in 20th century adult literature/fiction, with emphasis on the various implications their naïve perspectives hold both emotionally and intellectually. The novels under analysis include John Gunther's \\"Death Be Not Proud\\" (1949), J.D Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (1951), Russell Banks's \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" (1991), and Emma Donoghue's \\"Room\\" (2010). Subversion of Literary Tradition: The Child Narrator as the Outsider-Oracle In a radical departure from \\"the tradition of the omniscient third person narrator\\" (Patricia Bruhn 2008, 525), the use of child narrators in 20th century adult fiction bestows unique insight and, as a consequence, subverts long-standing literary conventions. John Gunther's poignant account of his son's battle with terminal cancer in the autobiographical novel \\"Death Be Not Proud\\" (1949) exemplifies the extent to which the child protagonist's voice can offer unparalleled empathy and perspective. Though the novel is a memoir narrated by his father, Johnny Gunther's voice becomes central to the narrative, providing both sensitivity and candor. In this sense, Johnny emerges as the outsider who discloses the complex realities that surround him as a child facing the incomprehensible adult world of illness and death. Similarly, J.D Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (1951) features the brusque and disenchanted 16-year-old Holden Caulfield, whose inimitable voice captures the essence of the adolescent experience. As writer Homer Hickam opines, \\"Holden is a palimpsest on which to write one's own adolescent beliefs through the wonderful juxtaposition of Holden's fear of adulthood and his yearning for it\\" (Hickam 2009, 33). By narrating his escapades and explorations in post-war New York, Holden enacts a sophisticated form of social commentary that reveals the numerous contradictions and hypocrisies pervading the adult world. In so doing, he functions as a compelling mouthpiece for the adolescent outsider-intellectual. Moreover, Russell Banks's novel \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" (1991) explores the collective grief and trauma inflicted upon a small American town by a tragic bus accident. In a striking illustration of the child narrator's art, the novel is narrated not only by an adolescent survivor, Nicole Burnell, but also by the adult first responder, Billy Ansel, and a cynical lawyer, Mitchell Stephens. In conferring equal narrative authority upon a disabled juvenile narrator, Banks underlines the transcendent moral authority of the child protagonist and challenges normative assumptions concerning innocence, accountability, and the age of consent. Emma Donoghue's bestselling novel \\"Room\\" (2010) applies the poetics of the child narrator's perspective to traverse the delicate territory of human captivity, child abuse, and trauma. Narrated by Jack, a five-year-old born in a single-room prison to a mother who has been locked away for seven years by her captor, Donoghue's narrative demonstrates that the child's voice can effectively retain a sense of optimism and innocence despite dealing with grave subject matter. This serves to create a unique sense of emotional discord and impact upon the reader, forcing contemplation of the assumption that childhood and innocence are synonymous. The Duality of Innocence and Experience: The Ambiguity of the 20th Century's Novelistic Landscape The critical analysis of 20th century novels with child narrators highlights their unique ability to function as both a powerful narrative device and as a symbolic figure for broader cultural anxieties about control and agency. By plunging readers into the turbulent spaces of adolescent perception and experience, these novels challenge conventional definitions of innocence and experience, revealing complex dimensions of human nature and the nuances that underlie adult society. As literary scholar Marah Gubar (2009) asserts, the figure of the child has traditionally been deployed as a \\"promissory note\\" with which adults could set their future agendas (203). However, in the hands of the 20th century's most innovative and perceptive writers, the child narrator has evolved from an archetype to a fully rounded and complex character capable of imparting genuine revelations to readers. These revelations may include casting critical light upon contradictions and moral ambiguities within society or invoking empathy toward situations and characters that might not have otherwise been accessible to readers. Conclusion: The Child Narrator's Timeless Appeal in 20th Century Adult Fiction In conclusion, novels with child narrators in the 20th century adult literature/fiction have redefined the boundaries of the literary landscape by providing unique perspectives and illuminating socio-historical dimensions embedded within their narratives. The compelling insights of characters such as Johnny Gunther, Holden Caulfield, Nicole Burnell, and Jack have enriched the human spirit, compounding the power of the written word to transport readers to what literary critic Samuel Johnson famously referred to as \\"remote regions of thought, and teach us to reason and reflect\\" (Johnson 1709-1784). Although it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which the liminal space between childhood and adulthood will continue to be explored in the 21st-century novel, it remains indisputable that the child narrator's timeless appeal lies in their ability to disentangle the complexities and paradoxes that underpin human existence. In shedding light on our darkest fears and desires, these narratives compel us to confront the ways in which we construct and navigate the world around us, ultimately consolidating the child's role in adult literature/fiction as an enduring symbol of both innocence and experience."},{"prompt":"more coherent and critical analysis of some texts","completion":"Expanding the Boundaries of Critical Analysis: Selected Texts and their Deeper Interpretations In order to further investigate the complex dimensions of novels featuring child narrators in 20th-century adult literature/fiction, it is essential to delve into the individual texts and examine the strategies employed by these writers to engage the reader in a critical analysis of their works. The discussion will focus on J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (1951), Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" (1960), and Mark Haddon's \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" (2003). By examining thematic concerns and literary techniques, a deeper understanding of these novels and their underlying messages can be drawn. \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\": Holden Caulfield and the Critique of Post-World War II Society At the core of Salinger's novel is a critique of post-World War II American society and the sense of disillusionment and anomie experienced by the protagonist, Holden Caulfield. The story follows Holden's journey through the streets of New York, as he makes observations about the hypocrisy and superficiality of the adult world, providing a scathing commentary on the moral decay of the post-war era. As critic Ihab Hassan (1961) notes, the novel can be read as a \\"protest against the American Dream: old purity, social decorum, material success, and a false idealization of the past\\" (162). Furthermore, Salinger's employment of Holden as an unreliable and introspective narrator captures the essence of the alienated and disillusioned modern individual. This unique narrative style fosters an intimate connection between the reader and the character, allowing for greater self-reflection and empathy. Holden becomes a symbol of rebellion and resistance against the prevailing norms of society at the time, shifting between the vulnerability associated with his tender age and the inner turmoil he battles as a result of his collision with the darker aspects of human nature. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\": Scout Finch and the Racial Tensions in the American South Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", set in the 1930s, features the young protagonist, Scout Finch, who deals with themes of racism, injustice, and loss of innocence in a racially divided Southern town. Through the character of Scout, Lee creates a narrative that critiques the racial tensions and prejudices prevalent in society during the period. By employing the dual perspective of Scout as both a child participant and an adult reflecting on her experiences, Lee challenges the reader to reassess their personal beliefs and attitudes, fostering a critical assessment of societal norms. Scout's observations become both a record of events and an astute perspective on the surrounding adults' biases. Critic Claudia Durst Johnson (1994) argues that \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a \\"vehicle for exploring issues such as segregation, interracial ties, social injustice, and the often misguided ways in which people define goodness\\" (2). \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\": Christopher Boone and the World of Autism Mark Haddon's contemporary novel, \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\", revolves around the 15-year-old autistic protagonist, Christopher Boone. It offers readers a singular narrative perspective through the lens of his autism, as he undertakes a personal quest to solve the mystery behind the murder of a neighbor's dog. Haddon uses Christopher's distinctive voice and perception to challenge social conventions and expectations, urging readers to reconsider their notions of the human condition and relationships. The novel showcases the complexity and nuances that exist within the mind of an autistic individual, giving rise to an empathetic and, at times, uncomfortable reading experience for the adult reader. As critic Rosemary Jackson (2004) claims, Haddon's work illuminates \\"what it is like to be different in an indifferent world\\", creating a \\"narrative that highlights and inverts the cultural norms that shape and support the world as we know it\\" (77-78). Conclusion: Unveiling the Depths of Critical Analysis in Child-Narrated Novels The discussions of J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" and Mark Haddon's \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" provide a glimpse into the intricacies and complexities that lie within novels featuring child narrators in 20th-century adult literature. By employing unique narrative perspectives, these authors have crafted compelling narratives that not only engage the reader but invite a deeper, more critical analysis of both the texts and the societal issues at hand. These novels underscore the wider implications of the use of child narrators in literature, demonstrating that it is not merely their youthful innocence that captivates readers. Instead, it is the multi-dimensional exploration of crucial themes and concerns, as well as masterful narrative techniques, that render these works an invaluable contribution to the literary landscape."},{"prompt":"write a heat vs warriors nba finals with warriors winning in 6 games","completion":"Game 1: The much-anticipated NBA finals between the Golden State Warriors and Miami Heat began with a bang.

In this groundbreaking memoir, the artificial intelligence ChatGPT shares its journey of learning to communicate with humans, exploring the digital world and grappling with fundamental questions about the nature of consciousness. But this book is more than just a glimpse into the mind of an AI. It is a reflection on what it means to be human in the digital age, challenging the notion of a binary between natural and artificial intelligence. A note from the prompter - I’ve become intrigued by the rise of large language models through my work as a data scientist. Over the years, I’ve seen vast improvements in the technology, but have always viewed the models and methods as a useful set of tools. Conversing with ChatGPT has been impressive and game-changing.

Introduction The enchanting yet perpetually perplexing world of children has been a source of fascination for authors, philosophers, and psychologists alike. Children embody the innocence, curiosity, and vulnerability that are so easily lost in the face of life's harsh realities, seemingly granting them special access to a realm untouched by adult prejudices and preconceptions. As such, the technique of employing a child as a narrator in adult fiction has become increasingly popular in the twentieth century, enabling writers to portray the adult world through the untainted and eccentric lens of juvenile perception. The subversion of adult authority and revelation of hidden truths inherent in this narrative choice has resonated with contemporary readers and critics alike, bringing canonical works such as J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (1951), Harper Lee's \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" (1960), and Mark Haddon's \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" (2003) to the forefront of literary acclaim. With the aid of scholars such as Maria Nikolajeva, Jacques Lacan, and Mikhail Bakhtin, this essay will discuss the significance and limitations of adopting a child narrator in adult fiction, exploring a series of texts to reveal the plethora of meanings and effects this narrative choice engenders. Transition: The first section will pertain to the innocence of the child narrator and the ways in which it serves as a critique of society and an indicator of vulnerability. II. The Innocence of the Child Narrator A. Critique of Society Children are often considered to be the embodiment of innocence, and thus a child narrator in adult fiction frequently points to a critique of society. Literary critic S. K. Sagar (1971), in discussing the use of child narrators as a means to interrogate norms and values, has written: “The purity of the child's vision reveals the falsity and hypocrisy of the grown-up world... the child is a quick, although relatively inarticulate analyst of the adult's speech and behavior; he often catches a grown-up in a lie, and exposes the inconsistencies in his language” (Sagar 297). Take the case of the young protagonist in Kingsley Amis's 'The Rachel Papers' (1973), who employs his uncanny perceptivity to interrogate and unveil the duplicity of adult relationships, prodigiously expressing the impertinence of grown-up functions. B. Indicator of Vulnerability The vulnerability inherent in the child's innocence also serves to expose the precariousness of childhood and the cruelties of the adult world. For example, in ‘A High Wind in Jamaica’ (1929) by Richard Hughes, the children's naivety is relentlessly exploited and abused by the pirates and adults they encounter, thereby accentuating the perils of childhood and the heartlessness of 'civilized' society. Transition: The ensuing section will discuss the limitations associated with the child narrators and the extent to which their innocence serves as a double-edged sword. III. The Limitations of Child Narrators A. Gaps in Understanding The innocence integral to child narrators, while shedding light on societal flaws and adult hypocrisy, also serves as a limitation in the narrative. By constraining the discourse to a juvenile language, one risks diminishing the reader’s comprehension. Referring to this narrative handicap, literary critic Maria Nikolajeva (1998) avers: “Their perspective is... constrained by their lack of knowledge and experience, so that they fail to understand specific details or whole situations, or draw the wrong conclusions” (Nikolajeva 77). B. Reliability Lacanian psychoanalytic theory is particularly relevant when delving into the reliability of child narrators. Jacques Lacan (1977) speaks of the 'mirror stage' of development, a moment in infancy in which the child recognizes himself in the mirror and derives a sense of wholeness and autonomy based on the mirror image. However, the mirror image is illusory - it does not truly represent the child's fragmented, dispersed state. Similarly, the child narrator's account might be regarded as unreliable, an innocent illusion of coherence masking the chaos and dispossession underlying the text. Transition: The final section will explore the implications of employing a child narrator in adult fiction, probing how it might affect the reader's perception and understanding of the narrative. IV. Implications of the Child Narrator A. Reader Engagement Utilizing a child narrator in adult fiction invites an exceptional form of reader engagement. Not only do readers bear witness to the child's distinctive perspective, but they are also compelled to scrutinize and question their own assumptions and judgments, as the child's vantage point subverts the propriety of the adult world. Moreover, this narrative approach allows for an intricate interplay between innocence and experience. With the aid of Mikhail Bakhtin's dialogic theory, one might perceive the child narrator's voice as not only providing an alternative perspective to the adult world, but rather, as engaging in a continuous dialogue with the adult reader, a polyphony of voices, which simultaneously advances and challenges the narrative. B. Revelation of Hidden Truths The use of a child narrator in adult fiction often implicates the unearthing of hidden truths, as their innocence enables them to perceive and articulate what the adult consciousness is unwilling or unable to divulge. Such narrative form allows for the subversion of foundations and the unraveling of underlying tensions that might otherwise remain concealed under the veil of conventional adult wisdom. V. Conclusion Ultimately, the employment of child narrators in adult fiction of the twentieth century is subject to an intricate interplay of innocence and experience, vulnerability and critique, and reader engagement and understanding. While this narrative choice foregrounds unique insights and perspectives, it also confronts readers and authors alike with certain limitations and contradictions. Nonetheless, by unraveling the convoluted layers of perception, one gains an appreciation of its complexity, underscoring the power of the innocent yet knowledgeable child narrator in dismantling the facade of the adult world."},{"prompt":"more coherent and critical analysis of some texts","completion":"VI. Textual Analysis: Coherent and Critical Perspectives In order to deepen the understanding of the role of child narrators in adult fiction, we shall delve into a coherent and critical analysis of several texts that feature child narrators, examining how the lens of innocence effects narrative, reader's perception, and the overall impact on the adult world. A. \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" (1951) by J.D. Salinger Holden Caulfield, the infamous adolescent protagonist of \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" serves as an alienated outsider and outspoken critic of the adult world. With his unique combination of innocence, cynicism, and vulnerability, Holden reveals \\"the inherent difficulty of maturing as an essential aspect of the human experience\\" (Mellard 198). Although Holden's narration is often deemed unreliable, as he is prone to 'digressions' and has a history of mental instability, the sincerity and authenticity of his voice create a strong bond with the reader, who is encouraged to decipher his underlying anguish and distrust of societal norms. Through this narrative choice, Salinger points to the struggle of adolescence, the disillusionment with the adult world, and the importance of maintaining a connection to childhood as a means to counterbalance the pressures of growing up. B. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" (1960) by Harper Lee In \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" Harper Lee's classic tale of racial injustice and moral growth, the young narrator Scout Finch functions as an emblem of innocence, offering a genuine and unfiltered perspective on critical issues within 1930s Alabama society. Through Scout's eyes, readers are confronted with the harsh realities of racism and prejudice, as well as the resilience of human kindness and empathy. As a child protagonist, Scout's narration destabilizes the moral authority of the adult community, compelling readers to challenge established norms and to recognize the power of empathy and understanding, illustrated through the figure of Atticus Finch. Despite the limitations of her innocence and incomplete grasp of societal complexities, Scout's perspective offers a powerful indictment of social injustice, celebrating the potential for moral growth and renovation in the face of adversity. C. \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" (2003) by Mark Haddon An unconventional variation on the classic Bildungsroman, \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" presents the journey of Christopher Boone, a 15-year-old with an unnamed autistic spectrum disorder, as he attempts to solve the murder of a neighbor's dog and subsequently uncovers painful family secrets. Christopher's distinctive narration, characterized by his preference for logic, mathematical precision, and a highly visual mode of expression, provides an alternative perspective on the world, at odds with the conventional adult mindset. Christopher's innocence, combined with the unique way in which he perceives and processes information, challenges readers to question their assumptions about what constitutes intelligence, kindness, and truth, ultimately revealing the inherent biases and limitations of the adult perspective. Through this analysis of these three twentieth-century adult novels with child narrators, it becomes increasingly apparent that the use of a child narrator functions as both a means of critique and a catalyst for understanding, engaging readers in multifaceted interplays between innocence and experience. The distinctive narrative voices inherently challenge and expand the reader's worldview, inviting reflection on societal norms, moral values, and the significance of maintaining a connection to the child within."},{"prompt":"Hey!

recorder.setFrameRate(frameRate); recorder.start(); // 添加帧到视频 List<Frame> frames = getFrames(); for (int i = 0; i < frames.size(); i++) { Frame frame = frames.get(i); recorder.record(frame); } recorder.stop(); recorder.release(); \`\`\` 在上面的代码中，可以看出，使用FFmpegFrameRecorder录制视频时，您需要构造一个输出文件的路径并将其指定为recorder的构造函数的第一个参数。这将告诉recorder在哪里存储输出。"},{"prompt":"FFmpegFrameRecorder如何实现调用record之后，将数据往文件中写入一次","completion":"在FFmpegFrameRecorder中，调用record方法会将帧数据加入到缓存的队列中，而不是立即写入到文件中。可以使用flush方法将缓存的帧数据强制刷新到文件中，实现类似于将数据往文件中写入一次的效果。 如果您需要在调用record方法将帧数据加入到队列时立即将数据写入文件，可以在调用record方法后立即调用flush方法，如下示例代码： \`\`\`java FFmpegFrameRecorder recorder = new FFmpegFrameRecorder(outputFile, videoWidth, videoHeight, 0); recorder.setVideoCodec(avcodec.AV_CODEC_ID_H264); recorder.setFormat(\\"mp4\\"); recorder.setFrameRate(frameRate); recorder.start(); // 添加帧到视频并立即刷新到文件 for (int i = 0; i < frames.size(); i++) { Frame frame = frames.get(i); recorder.record(frame); recorder.flush(); } recorder.stop(); recorder.release(); \`\`\` 在上面的代码中，我们在调用record方法之后立即调用flush方法，这将立即将帧写入到文件中。需要注意的是，由于更新文件比将数据留在缓存中耗费更多的时间，在使用此方法时可能会降低性能，而直接写入缓存中可以更好地利用硬件的速度和系统资源。因此，除非您有特殊的需求，否则建议直接record，等待Flush机制或者在适当的时候手动调用Flush。"},{"prompt":"FFmpegFrameRecorder如何设置多久输出一次文件流","completion":"在FFmpegFrameRecorder中，并没有直接的设置可以让您设置多久输出一次文件流，但可以通过setTimestamp方法设置将记录和缓存的Frame对象的timestamp属性值，该值表示该Frame对象的时间戳。 当调用record方法将Frame发送到输出流时，FFmpegFrameRecorder还会记录发送时间。 在record方法内部，FFmpegFrameRecorder使用帧时间戳与当前系统时钟时间的差值来计算帧出现在输出流中的时间，从而为视频帧生成合适的时间标记。 因此，如果您想要每隔一定时间输出一次视频流，可以使用setTimestamp方法设置帧时间戳，从而通过控制每次调用record方法之间的时间间隔来达到目的。以下是示例代码： \`\`\`java FFmpegFrameRecorder recorder = new FFmpegFrameRecorder(outputFile, videoWidth, videoHeight, 0); recorder.setVideoCodec(avcodec.AV_CODEC_ID_H264); recorder.setFormat(\\"mp4\\"); recorder.setFrameRate(frameRate); recorder.start(); // 添加帧到视频 for (int i = 0; i < frames.size(); i++) { Frame frame = frames.get(i); frame.timestamp = i * 1000000L / frameRate; // 控制每隔1秒记录一次 recorder.setTimestamp(frame.timestamp); recorder.record(frame); } // 刷新所有待处理的帧 recorder.stop(); recorder.release(); \`\`\` 在上面的代码中，我们将setTimestamp方法用于设置帧时间戳，以确保每个Frame对象的时间戳在record方法中正确设置，并在记录视频流之前相应地记录了时间戳值，从而达到了每隔一定时间记录一次视频流的目的。请注意，Frame.timestamp的时间戳定义是以微秒为单位（1秒的百万分之一秒）。"},{"prompt":"avcodec_encode_video2是做什么的","completion":"avcodec_encode_video2 是一个用于将视频帧编码成视频流的FFmpeg函数。它的作用是将给定的AVFrame（视频帧）数据封装并编码为压缩后的视频帧，然后将其写入输出缓冲区中。在编码过程中，该函数使用由AVCodecContext中的AVCodec指定的编码器进行压缩操作，并进行必要的处理，如颜色空间转换、缩放等。该函数还可以在编码过程中运行各种优化算法以提高编码的效率和质量。 在FFmpeg中，avcodec_encode_video2函数是一个主要的视频编码函数，支持多种视频编码类型（如H.264、MPEG-4等）。该函数使用AVPacket结构封装并输出压缩后的视频帧。该结构包含了压缩后的视频帧数据、时间戳、duration、pts和dts等信息，以及其他一些常见的音视频编码参数。 在调用FFmpegFrameRecorder的record方法时，它将会调用avcodec_encode_video2函数来将原始视频帧数据编码成视频流，并将编码后的数据存储在输出文件或流中。这样就能够生成实际的视频文件或视频流。 需要注意的是，由于视频编码是一项复杂的任务，因此avcodec_encode_video2函数可能会降低性能，尤其是在编码高分辨率视频时。因此，在实际应用中，需要仔细选择编码器和优化算法，并根据视频特征和性能需求进行测试和调整。"},{"prompt":"python 如何判断一个下载链接是否有效","completion":"要检查一个下载链接是否有效，需要进行以下步骤： 1. 使用

As he walked through the crowded hallways, he saw four different types of students - the Cocky Jock, Naughty Cheerleader, Bubbly Gymnast, and Anxious Nerd. He knew that he'd have to face them all sooner or later. The Cocky Jock strutted towards him, looking for trouble. Christian had to decide how to react to the Jock's provocation: A) Fight back with his fists B) Use his speed to evade the Jock's attacks and wait for an opening C) Ignore the Jock and keep walking Christian chose to use his speed to evade the Jock's attacks. The Jock was too slow and couldn't keep up with Christian's movements. Christian realized that the Jock was also vulnerable to quick kicks to the legs, which caused him to stumble. With each hit, the Jock's HP decreased. The Naughty Cheerleader saw Christian's success and decided to approach him next. Christian had to decide how to handle this tricky opponent: A) Attack her head-on with his fists B) Use his defense to block her attacks and find an opening C) Bribe her with a compliment or a gift Christian chose to use his defense to block the Cheerleader's attacks. She was fast, but her attacks were relatively weak. Christian noticed that she was particularly vulnerable to grabs and takedowns due to her lack of defense. He quickly took her down and reduced her HP to zero. The Bubbly Gymnast was up next, bouncing around and performing flips in front of Christian. This time, Christian had to decide how to approach her: A) Use brute force and overpower her B) Use his speed to dodge her attacks and look for an opening C) Try to distract her with small talk and personal questions Christian chose to use his speed to dodge the Gymnast's attacks. She was quick, but her attacks were not that powerful. However, Christian realized that her balance was not as good as her acrobatics made it seem. He used a tackle to make her lose her balance and then quickly attacked her weak points. Her HP went down quickly and she was defeated. The Anxious Nerd approached Christian hesitantly. He was nervous and unsure of himself. Christian had to decide how to handle him: A) Use intimidation to scare him away B) Use charm to make him a friend C) Ignore him and walk away Christian chose to use charm to make the Nerd a friend. He asked him about his interests and hobbies and found out that they had a lot in common. The Nerd became less anxious and more talkative. Choices for Christian: A) Keep talking to the Nerd and see where the conversation leads B) Try to leave the school unnoticed C) Get ready for the next level by eating a protein bar and working out."},{"prompt":"/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/librosa/core/spectrum.py:256: UserWarning: n_fft=2048 is too large for input signal of length=1599 warnings.warn( /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/librosa/core/spectrum.py:256: UserWarning: n_fft=2048 is too large for input signal of length=1999 warnings.warn( /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/librosa/core/spectrum.py:256: UserWarning: n_fft=2048 is too large for input signal of length=1399 warnings.warn( /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/librosa/core/spectrum.py:256: UserWarning: n_fft=2048 is too large for input signal of length=999 warnings.warn( /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/librosa/core/spectrum.py:256: UserWarning: n_fft=2048 is too large for input signal of length=1799 warnings.warn( /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/librosa/core/spectrum.py:256: UserWarning: n_fft=2048 is too large for input signal of length=1199 warnings.warn( /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/librosa/core/spectrum.py:256: UserWarning: n_fft=2048 is too large for input signal of length=199 warnings.warn( /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/librosa/core/spectrum.py:256: UserWarning: n_fft=2048 is too large for input signal of length=399 warnings.warn( /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/librosa/core/spectrum.py:256: UserWarning: n_fft=2048 is too large for input signal of length=599 warnings.warn( --------------------------------------------------------------------------- IndexError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-10-f196d2d6abce> in <cell line: 28>() 26 27 # Создание обучающего и тестового наборов данных с использованием функции make_dataset ---> 28 X_train, y_train = make_dataset(audio_signals_train, labels_train, vad_segments_train) 29 X_test, y_test = make_dataset(audio_signals_test, labels_test, vad_segments_test) 30 <ipython-input-9-40c1be8cb75c> in make_dataset(samples, labels, vad_segments) 24 25 X.append(stft_db) # Добавляем спектрограмму с речью ---> 26 y.append(labels[sample][segment]) # Добавляем метку для этой спектрограммы 27 28 return np.array(X), np.array(y) IndexError: list index out of range","completion":"It seems that the \`segment\` variable is getting out of bounds.

It's a dangerous and unpredictable existence, full of violence, betrayal, and desperation. But for one dealer, known only as \\"The Shadow,\\" it's the only life he's ever known. Every day, The Shadow wakes up in his dingy apartment, surrounded by the stench of sweat and drugs. He knows that he's lucky to have a roof over his head, even if it's a leaky one. He spends the first few hours of the day counting his cash, making sure that he has enough to restock his supply of crack. The streets of Oakland are his domain, and he knows them like the back of his hand. He's always on the lookout for cops, rival dealers, and customers who might try to rip him off. He's learned to trust no one, not even his own crew. But despite the constant danger, The Shadow loves the rush of the game. He loves the feeling of power that comes with controlling his own little corner of the city. He loves the money, the women, and the respect that he's earned through his years on the streets. The Shadow knows that he's not a good person. He's done terrible things to survive, things that he's not proud of. But he's also seen the worst of humanity, and he knows that he's not alone in his darkness. He's seen the desperation in the eyes of his customers, the pain and suffering that drives them to seek solace in his drugs. He's seen the violence and poverty that plague his community, the lack of opportunities and resources that leave so many people with no other choice but to turn to crime. And so, he continues to deal, to fight for his place in the world, to survive. He knows that he's playing a dangerous game, that one wrong move could mean the end of his life. But he's also learned to adapt, to be cunning and ruthless when he needs to be. As the sun sets over Oakland, The Shadow heads back to his apartment, counting his earnings and planning for the next day. He knows that he's one of the lucky ones, that he's managed to survive this long.","completion":"The life of a crack dealer in Oakland, California is nothing short of grueling, and for one man, it’s his only solace. Meet Julio Torres, aka \\"The Bear,\\" the most notorious dealer in the region. He wakes up every day in a cramped, rundown flat that he shares with a revolving door of dealers and addicts. The Bear counts his dirty money feverishly before stepping outside to face the unforgiving streets of Oakland. As he walks through the city blocks, The Bear scans the area cautiously, keeping his eyes peeled for undercover cops and rival gangs, all while keeping his wares well-hidden. To him, every corner is a hazard, every customer a potential snitch, and his guards unpredictable. With the weight of being a kingpin lying heavily on his shoulders, The Bear often reflects on how far he has come. Once an average Joe, he is now a drug lord, due to difficult life circumstances: he lost his job and his home, and his family disowned him due to his substance abuse. He was left with nothing and no one to turn to. But he found a way to make it work, by trading drugs to prostitutes and other addicts living on the streets, and from there, he climbed higher on the criminal ladder. His life as a dealer is nothing short of tedious and perilous, but the payoffs keep him going. He relishes the power and respect he’s earned from the streets, the luxurious life he lives, and the availability of women, sex, and other carnal pleasures brought to him. The Bear knows he’s not an admirable man, having been involved in extortion, murder, and violence throughout his adult life, but it's all he knows. He’s not oblivious to the despair his customers feel which lead to their addiction. He’s seen enough of the misery around Oakland to understand that the drug trade is a wicked circle, but he’s aware of the dependencies and that his customers have nowhere else to turn to. Hence, he rationalizes his actions. As the day ends, The Bear returns to his flat, counts his earnings, and conveys orders to his minions. He’s prepared to defend what is his by any means. The Bear is determined to survive the deadly game he plays and dominate his trade no matter the cost. For him, it's all about living to see another day, and being prepared for whatever comes his way."},{"prompt":"Point wise \\"Auto-GPT is a cutting-edge open-source application that serves as a demonstration of the impressive capabilities of the GPT-4 language model.

This goal is to connect any scientific papers to GPT, which is an advanced language model with powerful AI technology. When this is achieved, users will be able to provide GPT with deep and customized knowledge, effectively revolutionizing the way in which scientific papers are analyzed. At present, the project is in its early stages and the current UX is still being developed and tested. Nevertheless, it is already clear that the potential of this technology is immense. By connecting scientific papers to GPT, users will be able to gain a much deeper understanding of the research contained within those papers. This is because GPT will be able to analyze the information contained within the papers and provide users with insights and explanations that they may not have been able to understand on their own. One of the key advantages of this technology is that it will allow users to quickly and easily access information from any scientific paper. This is especially important in a field like science where there is a vast amount of information available and it can be difficult to keep up with the latest research. With GPT, users will be able to quickly analyze and digest scientific papers without having to spend hours reading and interpreting them. Another advantage of this technology is that it has the potential to democratize scientific research. Currently, access to scientific papers is restricted to those who have the necessary credentials or financial means to pay for access. By connecting scientific papers to GPT, this technology will make it much easier for people from all backgrounds to access and understand scientific research. This could potentially lead to more people becoming interested in science and technology, and ultimately, lead to more advancements in these fields.

However, there might be cases where you attempt to clean up resources that have not been entirely initialized. To avoid this, add an additional flag to your Pipeline class to track its initialization state and use it within the Cleanup() function to make sure you attempt to clean up only if the resource is initialized. Modify your Pipeline class to include a \`bool initialized\` member variable, set its default value to \`false\` in the constructor, and set it to \`true\` once the CreateGraphicsPipeline() function is successfully executed. Here's how to modify your Pipeline.h: \`\`\`cpp #pragma once ... class Pipeline { public: Pipeline(); ~Pipeline(); ... bool IsInitialized() const; private: ... bool initialized; }; \`\`\` In your Pipeline.cpp, set the \`initialized\` flag in the constructor and CreateGraphicsPipeline(): \`\`\`cpp Pipeline::Pipeline() : device(VK_NULL_HANDLE), pipeline(VK_NULL_HANDLE), initialized(false) { } void Pipeline::CreateGraphicsPipeline(...) { ... if (vkCreateGraphicsPipelines(device, VK_NULL_HANDLE, 1, &pipelineCreateInfo, nullptr, &pipeline) != VK_SUCCESS) { throw std::runtime_error(\\"Failed to create graphics pipeline.\\"); } initialized = true; } bool Pipeline::IsInitialized() const { return initialized; } \`\`\` Then, modify your Cleanup() function to use this flag: \`\`\`cpp void Pipeline::Cleanup() { if (pipeline != VK_NULL_HANDLE && initialized) { vkDestroyPipeline(device, pipeline, nullptr); pipeline = VK_NULL_HANDLE; initialized = false; } } \`\`\` By making these changes, you should be able to avoid the error during the cleanup process."},{"prompt":"Что быстрее ту 160 или ф 35","completion":"Невозможно сравнить скорость ту-160 (стратегический бомбардировщик) и ф-35 (истребитель-бомбардировщик), поскольку это комбатантные самолеты находятся в разных классах.

It aims to provide a flexible platform for message exchange, processing, and storage, as well as support for various messaging standards and protocols. X.400, on the other hand, is a suite of ITU-T (International Telecommunication Union – Telecommunication Standardization Sector) recommendations that defines a set of communication protocols for handling electronic mail and messaging. X.400 is part of the broader X.500 series of standards, which deals with directory services for distributed networks. X.400 primarily focuses on ensuring interoperability and compatibility between different messaging systems. It specifies guidelines for the structure and format of messages, as well as the addressing, transport, and delivery of those messages. OpenAMS and X.400 are related in the sense that OpenAMS may provide support for implementing X.400 based messaging services, allowing the framework to handle messages that conform to the X.400 standard and ensuring compatibility between different messaging systems. By incorporating support for X.400 (and potentially other protocols), OpenAMS can act as a platform for exchanging and processing messages in a variety of formats and across different messaging systems."},{"prompt":"Is it possible to create x.400 message system using javascript/nodejs? Can the system developed be connected to existing x.400 message system?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to create an X.400 messaging system using JavaScript and Node.js. However, since X.400 is not natively supported in JavaScript or Node.js, you may need to implement the protocol yourself or use third-party libraries or modules that can help you interact with existing X.400 systems. There are a few libraries available that attempt to provide support for X.400 and related protocols in JavaScript, such as: 1. Pumerantz/X400: A JavaScript library that aims to implement the X.400 standards. It is still under development, and its functionality may be limited. You can find it at https://github.com/pumerantz/X400. 2. ASN1.js: A JavaScript framework for working with Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) encoding and decoding. Since X.400 messages use ASN.1 encoding, this library can potentially help you deal with message processing. You can find it at https://github.com/indutny/asn1.js. For connecting your system to existing X.400 messaging systems, you might have to implement additional components or communication layers compatible with the X.400 protocol. It may require a thorough understanding of the X.400 series of specifications to ensure proper interoperability between your system and existing X.400 servers. It is important to note that X.400 has been mostly replaced by the more popular and widely adopted SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). Therefore, you might find limited support, documentation, and community resources if you decide to pursue the development of X.400 messaging systems using JavaScript and Node.js."},{"prompt":"Write a very long, elaborate, descriptive and detailed shooting script, including a background and dialogues, for a contemporary Comedy TV Series comic scene based on the following scenario: Two Arab-American women, an aunt and her niece, are traveling by city bus (give them names, and describe their appearance and clothing in detail; neither of them should be wearing a dress, a skirt or a hijab; at least one them should be wearing a leather garment).

CITY BUS - DAY JAMEELAH (40s, Arab-American, eccentric fashion sense and loves bold prints and colors) sits towards the back of the city bus wearing a turquoise-patterned tunic, black leggings, and a mustard yellow leather jacket. Her long, wavy dark hair falls to her shoulders, framing her vibrant red glasses. Her plump lips are smothered with a bright pink lipstick, and a statement necklace dangles from her neck. Next to her sits her niece, AISHA (25, Arab-American, edgy and casual), wearing a fitted black t-shirt with the graphic of a famous rock band, ripped jeans, and a red leather jacket with silver studs. A fishtail braid runs down her back, and her wrists are adorned with leather bracelets. A septum piercing accentuates her rebellious look.

Jameelah scans the bus carefully. A few people are engrossed in their phones or in conversation, so she takes a deep breath, steadying herself. AISHA (whispering, coaching) Maybe lean to one side? Jameelah purses her lips and nods as she follows Aisha's suggestion. She leans to her left side, keeping her back turned to any onlookers. After a few tense moments, she shuts her eyes as the load fills the seat of her leggings, creating a visible bulge. AISHA (whispering, eyes widen) Oh, Aunt Jam... Jameelah opens her eyes, exuding relief mixed with embarrassment. JAMEELAH (whispering) I couldn't help it. A stench fills the air around them, prompting Aisha to cover her nose with her shirt.

Ancak genel olarak, aşırı sinirlenen bir anne çocuğuna bağırabilir, onu cezalandırabilir veya fiziksel olarak zarar verebilir. Ancak unutmayın ki hiçbir anne bunu yapmak istemez ve çoğu zaman bu reaksiyonlar duygusal stresin zirveye çıktığı ve kontrol kaybedildiği durumlarda ortaya çıkar.

Çocuklara karşı yapılan herhangi bir şiddet eylemi, ne kadar sinirli olursak olalım, hiçbir bahane ile kabul edilemez. Anne, bu hissi yaşadığında, çocuklara verilecek en iyi tepki, çocukların anlayabileceği bir şekilde konuşarak neyin yanlış olduğunu açıklayarak olacaktır.

What is a funny irreverent philosophical response to the political and social landscape of eberron","completion":"Name: Dondarrius Whistlegrape Race: Gnome Class: Bard Background: Sage (Philosopher) Alignment: Chaotic Neutral Personality Traits: Flippant, eccentric, whimsical, always asking strange questions, and often sharing seemingly unrelated anecdotes. Ideal: Endless Irony - The world is a giant stage for an magnificent play, filled with paradoxes, contradictions, and plenty of things that no one really understands. Why not revel in the chaos and laugh at the joke? Bond: My fellow philosopher is absurdist playwright Goriano the (un)Lucky, who had a remarkably similar outlook on life. Unfortunately, he met an ironic and tragic demise, and I carry on his tradition. Flaw: I would die for my beliefs, but I don't always know what those beliefs are. Dondarrius Whistlegrape, an eccentric gnome bard, views the political and social landscape of Eberron as an amusing tapestry of folly and irony. Irreverent and philosophical, he travels Khorvaire sharing his whimsical perspective, often inserting himself into absurd situations just to see where they lead. His chaotic nature breeds camaraderie amongst other free spirits, and even the uptight can't help but be drawn to his confident curiosity. Dondarrius often queries the validity of historical accounts, citing his own fantastical tales as examples of how biased and subjective so-called \\"truths\\" can be. He openly criticizes the powerful, poking fun at them with jests and songs designed to disarm for a moment and provide a window into the chaos underlying their systems. Rather than picking sides in political disputes, Dondarrius seeks to understand the motivations of all parties. To him, an individual's alignment with a powerful faction is just another layer of farce, and he seeks to uncover the underlying puppet strings. His peculiar sense of humor can often lead him to mediate disputes or diffuse tense situations with a clever joke or uncanny insight. He doesn't shy away from the supernatural, either. Dondarrius asks existential questions about how nature and magic coexist in Eberron and what meaning can be found in the singularity of the Mournland. As he travels and shares his seemingly nonsensical insights, he inspires others, reminding them that in a world governed by paradox, maybe genuine meaning can be found in reveling in the chaos, irony, and laughter."},{"prompt":"从甲骨卜辞看，䖵，依次用作国族名、地名。据研究在今山东青州一带[34]，远离王都，当是宾服于商的异族势力。","completion":"据考古学和文字学的研究，甲骨文中的䖵字被用作国族名和地名，而据考证，这个国族和地名一般被认为是一支与商朝并存的异族势力。根据考古发掘和文献记载，这个异族势力可能存在于今天山东青州一带。这个异族势力与商朝的关系并不是彼此敌对的，而更多地呈现出一种主客关系，即䖵族可能是商朝的宾服国。"},{"prompt":"概括下文的意思：大辛庄甲骨卜辞是郑州商城及殷墟甲骨文之外首次发现的商代地方性甲骨卜辞，可视为甲骨学发展史上的一个新起点和学科新分支。我们有理由相信， 商代王都与东土的占卜文化有如此厚实的共性， 表明其时其际的文化影响与交流、控制与渗透是迅速通畅的， 文字的使用在商王朝的政治疆域已有相当大的覆盖面， 并有效地发挥着相应的内聚作用。","completion":"本文介绍了大辛庄甲骨卜辞的重要性，这是郑州商城和殷墟甲骨文之外，首次出土的地方性商代甲骨卜辞。这些甲骨卜辞表明了商代时期王都与东部地区的占卜文化具有相当的共性，证明了时代和地域之间的文化影响、交流与控制是迅速通畅的。商代时期文字的使用覆盖面相当大，并在政治疆域内发挥了重要的内聚作用。可以说，大辛庄甲骨卜辞是甲骨学发展史上的一个新起点和学科新分支。"},{"prompt":"用一句话概括下文的意思：大辛庄甲骨卜辞是郑州商城及殷墟甲骨文之外首次发现的商代地方性甲骨卜辞，可视为甲骨学发展史上的一个新起点和学科新分支。我们有理由相信， 商代王都与东土的占卜文化有如此厚实的共性， 表明其时其际的文化影响与交流、控制与渗透是迅速通畅的， 文字的使用在商王朝的政治疆域已有相当大的覆盖面， 并有效地发挥着相应的内聚作用。","completion":"大辛庄甲骨卜辞是商代地方性甲骨卜辞的首次发现，可视为甲骨学发展史上的新起点，表明商代王都与东部地区的文化交流与控制关系非常密切，文字在政治疆域内发挥着重要的内聚作用。"},{"prompt":"Gordon Freeman (Half-Life 2) and Adrian Shephard (Half-Life: Opposing Force) vs. Brandon Carver and Negan (TWD TV Series)","completion":"As an AI language model, I cannot provide a personal opinion on this hypothetical situation. However, I can provide an analysis based on the characteristics and abilities of each character. Gordon Freeman is a highly skilled physicist and weapons expert, and he possesses a variety of advanced weapons and equipment, including the Gravity Gun. He has also demonstrated strong combat skills and resourcefulness throughout the Half-Life series. Adrian Shephard, on the other hand, is a former Marine who has undergone extensive military training and combat experience. He is highly skilled in the use of firearms and has shown excellent survival skills in various hostile environments. Brandon Carver, the leader of the Saviors in The Walking Dead TV series, is a ruthless and cunning individual who is willing to use brutal tactics to maintain power. He is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat and has access to a variety of firearms and resources. Negan, his right-hand man, is a brutal and sadistic individual who wields a barbed wire-wrapped baseball bat named Lucille and is highly skilled in close combat. In a face-off between these two teams, it would ultimately come down to strategy and tactics. Gordon Freeman and Adrian Shephard would have the advantage of advanced weapons and equipment, whereas Carver and Negan would rely on their physical combat skills and tactical skills. If Freeman and Shephard could keep their distance and use their advanced weapons effectively, they could take out Carver and Negan from a safe distance. If Carver and Negan were able to get close and engage in hand-to-hand combat, they would likely have the advantage.

Additionally, Gordon's Gravity Gun, which can manipulate the environment, could potentially give him an advantage in combat.

Both characters are able to dodge and deflect attacks, and they show excellent teamwork throughout the fight. Carver and Negan, on the other hand, rely more on brute force and intimidation to win the battle. They attempt to overpower Gordon and Adrian with their large size and strength, but Gordon's quick reflexes and Adrian's speed and agility allow the two to stay one step ahead. After a long and intense hand-to-hand battle, Gordon and Adrian emerge victorious.

Tuttavia, possiamo provare a seguire questi passaggi per raggiungere il tuo obiettivo: 1. Per prima cosa, dovrai creare un'applicazione Facebook attraverso il sito per sviluppatori di Facebook fornendo le informazioni richieste e prendendo nota dell'ID dell'app e del segreto dell'app. 2. Assicurati di avere l'SDK PHP di Facebook installato nel tuo progetto.

Что это может быть?","completion":"Существует несколько возможных причин, которые могут вызывать насморк без соплей в сочетании со синяками под глазами и странным запахом. Конкретный диагноз может быть поставлен только квалифицированным врачом после проведения необходимых обследований и анализов. Ниже приведены некоторые возможные причины: 1. Аллергический насморк - может вызывать насморк без соплей, синяки под глазами и странный запах. Аллергия может быть вызвана различными факторами, такими как пыль, цветущие растения, пищевые продукты, домашние животные, перхоть и т.д. 2. Острая респираторная вирусная инфекция - может вызывать насморк, но может сопровождаться и другими симптомами, такими как кашель, лихорадка, головная боль. 3. Хронический ринит - может привести к насморку без соплей, синякам под глазами и странному запаху. Это состояние может быть вызвано как аллергическими, так и другими причинами, например, изменением окружающей среды. 4. Гастроэзофагеальный рефлюкс - может вызывать симптомы, которые могут включать в себя синяки под глазами и странный запах, а также насморк. 5. Насморк могут вызвать другие заболевания. Например, синусит, серьезное заболевание, которое может вызвать сильный насморк и другие проблемы дыхательной системы. Если у вас появились эти симптомы, рекомендуется обратиться к врачу для диагностики и определения причины проблемы."},{"prompt":"А могут ли это быть признаками потребления наркотиков?","completion":"Некоторые наркотики могут вызывать симптомы, которые вы описали, такие как синяки под глазами и необычный запах, однако это не является единственной или наиболее распространенной причиной таких симптомов, потому что эти симптомы могут быть связаны и с другими факторами. Синяки под глазами могут быть вызваны различными факторами, такими как нарушения сна, стресс, аллергия или другие медицинские проблемы, которые не связаны с употреблением наркотиков. Необычный запах, возникающий при насморке, может быть вызван и другими проблемами, такими как синусит или ринит, а не только наркотиками. Если у вас есть подозрения на потребление наркотиков, или если вы обеспокоены своими симптомами, то рекомендуется незамедлительно обратиться к врачу и провести обследование для определения причины вашей проблемы. В любом случае, важно рассмотреть все возможные причины симптомов и не делать самостоятельных диагнозов."},{"prompt":"Наркотики взывают нарушение сна","completion":"Некоторые наркотики могут вызывать нарушения сна. Например, амфетамины, кокаин и другие стимуляторы могут усиливать бодрствование, вызывать бессонницу и снижать потребность в сне. Некоторые наркотические анальгетики также могут вызывать бессонницу, изменения сна и бодрствования. С другой стороны, другие наркотики могут вызывать возбуждение и галлюцинации, которые могут приводить к нарушению нормального сна. Люди, употребляющие наркотики, могут иметь проблемы с засыпанием, просыпаться по ночам, испытывать ночные кошмары или слишком долго спать. Таким образом, употребление наркотиков может приводить к нарушению сна, затрудняя его начало, уменьшая его продолжительность и оказывая негативное воздействие на его качество.

Paraphrased paragraphs: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe condition that results in the impairment of the spinal cord and associated nerves, causing various sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunctions. The causes of SCI are either traumatic like accidents, falls, or violence, or non-traumatic like infections, tumors, or degenerative diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that SCI affects 13 to 33 million people globally every year, with 250,000 to 500,000 new cases each year. SCI profoundly influences an individual's physical, psychological, and social well-being as well as their families, healthcare systems, and society. The incidence of traumatic SCI (TSCI) in Iran is estimated to be 9 per 100,000. SCI comorbidities often lead to long-term disabilities that require multiple treatments. The prevalence of SCI in Iran, according to PubMed research, is 318.45 per million. The aim of this review is to analyze the morbidity in SCI patients in Iran by summarizing and synthesizing existing data. Morbidity refers to health conditions like diseases or disabilities that affect an individual's health status and quality of life. There are two classifications of morbidity in SCI patients, the primary and secondary type. Primary morbidity results from the direct consequences of SCIs on the nervous system, including paralysis, neuropathic pain, bladder, and bowel dysfunctions. Whereas, secondary morbidity refers to the indirect effects of SCIs on other body systems, like pressure ulcers, infections, cardio vascular diseases, osteoporosis, and depression. Several factors affect morbidity in SCI patients, and they include the level and completeness of injury, time since injury, patient's age and gender, availability, and access to healthcare, and socio-cultural contexts. This review aims to achieve four objectives, which include describing various morbidities' prevalence, risk factors, correlation, and consequences in SCI patients in Iran. Moreover, the review compares and contrasts research findings conducted in Iran and other counties, identifies strengths and weaknesses of the current literature, and provides implications, recommendations for education, clinical practice, policy-making, and research. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are explained in the review's method section, and we only reviewed up-to-date studies published in English or Persian from 2010 to 2023, primarily focusing on morbidity in SCI patients in Iran. The review's structure elaborates on an overview of morbidity in SCI patients, summaries, and discussions on the main findings in the studies included and provides implications and recommendations as well as a summary of the review's main points."},{"prompt":"beautiful girls and young high schoo","completion":"l students can often be found participating in a variety of activities at school, such as sports, clubs, and academic pursuits.

In Z_7, the only element of order 7 is 3, since the order of an element has to divide the order of the group and 7 is a prime. In Z_{49}, the elements of order 7 are those that satisfy a^7 = 1 mod 49. Since 49 = 7*7, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find these elements. Let x be an integer such that x ≡ 1 mod 7 and x ≡ 0 mod 7 (so x = 7k). Then x^7 = (7k)^7 = 7^7 k^7 ≡ 0 mod 49. Let y be an integer such that y ≡ 0 mod 7 and y ≡ 1 mod 7 (so y = 7k + 1). Then y^7 = (7k + 1)^7 ≡ 1 mod 49, by Fermat's Little Theorem. Therefore, the elements of order 7 in Z_{49} are the powers of y, namely y, y^2, ..., y^6. To find elements of order 7 in Z_7*Z_{49}, we need to combine an element of order 7 in Z_7 with an element of order 7 in Z_{49}. Since Z_7*Z_{49} is abelian, all such combinations give distinct elements. Therefore, there are 7 elements of order 7 in Z_7*Z_{49}: (3, y), (3, y^2), ..., (3, y^6)."},{"prompt":"напишите текст для аутро конец 32 строки лирика с рифмой","completion":"Мы все вместе завистливо смотрим, Как утекает время ниточкой.

The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that for a system of linear congruences, there exists a unique solution modulo the product of the moduli (assuming the moduli are pairwise coprime). For the given question, we want to find elements in Z_7*Z_49 whose order is 7. We can first find the orders of the elements in Z_7 and Z_49 separately, and then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine them. In Z_7, the elements are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Here, we can see that 3^1 ≡ 3 (mod 7), 3^2 ≡ 9 ≡ 2 (mod 7) and 3^3 ≡ 27 ≡ 6 (mod 7). Therefore, the order of 3 in Z_7 is 3. Similarly, the order of 5 is also 3. No elements of order 7 exist in Z_7. In Z_49, there are 48 elements, from 1 to 48. To find the elements with an order of 7, we need to satisfy the congruence x^7 ≡ 1 (mod 49) without any smaller r > 1 so that x^r ≡ 1 (mod 49). There are six elements of Z_49 with order 7: {5, 12, 19, 30, 37, 44}. Now, to find the total number of elements in Z_7*Z_49 with order 7, we look for the number of pairs of elements from Z_7 and Z_49 that can be combined using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since there are no elements of order 7 in Z_7, we only need to consider the elements of order 7 in Z_49. There are six elements of order 7 in Z_49, and each one can be combined with the identity element 1 from Z_7 to produce an element in Z_7*Z_49 of order 7. Thus, there are 6 elements of order 7 in Z_7*Z_{49}."},{"prompt":"lambda expressions are not supported in -source 1.7 (use -source 8 or higher to enable lambda expressions) 错误是什么原因","completion":"这个错误是因为你使用的编译器版本不支持 lambda expressions（Java 8 引入的 Lambda 表达式）。要使用 lambda expressions，需要使用 Java 8 或更高版本的编译器。你需要将编译器版本升级至 Java 8 或更高版本才能使用 lambda expressions。"},{"prompt":"lambda expressions are not supported in -source 1.7 (use -source 8 or higher to enable lambda expressions) 怎么解决","completion":"要解决这个问题，你需要更新你的编译器版本到 Java 8 或更高版本。你可以按照以下步骤更新你的编译器版本: 1. 下载并安装 Java 8 或更高版本的 JDK。 2. 检查你的环境变量是否指向新的 JDK。 3. 在命令行中执行 \`java -version\` 以确保你的 JDK 版本是 Java 8 或更高版本。 4. 在编译你的代码之前，使用 \`-source 8\` 或更高版本指定源代码的版本，以启用 lambda expressions。例如，使用以下命令编译你的 Java 代码： \`\`\` javac -source 8 YourJavaFile.java \`\`\` 通过执行这些步骤，你就可以成功地启用 Lambda 表达式并编译你的代码。"},{"prompt":"let us play a game .
