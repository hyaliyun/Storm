Summing the values at all vertices, we should get ( 8k ) because there are 8 vertices. 5. Note that each edge is counted twice (once at each of its endpoints). Thus, this sum must also be equal to twice the sum of the numbers assigned to all edges. 6. The sum of the numbers from 1 to 12 is: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 12 = frac{12(12 + 1)}{2} = 78 ] 7.

Essentially, these equations compare each pair of coordinates in (mathbb{R}^5) and set them to be equal. Since there are (binom{5}{2} = 10) such pairwise comparisons, these equations collectively force a constraint on the five-dimensional space, effectively ordering the coordinates by numerical size.

The best case scenario would be for Paul to get the highest number of A+ grades because they have the highest reward per grade. However, we also need to consider the additional bonuses for combinations of A+ and A grades. Let's calculate the maximum amount based on the highest reward per grade and the additional bonuses: 1. If Paul gets A+ in all 12 courses, he would earn 20 per A+. Total from A+ grades = 12 * 20 = 240 Since he would have more than three A+ grades, he would also get the additional 50 bonus for having at least three A+ along with two A's (even though he wouldn't have any A's, the condition for three A+ is met). 2. The bonus for four or more A's with at least one A+ does not apply here because he has no A's, only A+ grades. 3. The bonus for no A+ but five or more A's also does not apply because he has A+ grades. Therefore, the maximum amount Paul could receive from his dad, in this case, would be the total from A+ grades plus the additional bonus for at least three A+ grades: Maximum amount = Total from A+ grades + Additional bonus Maximum amount = 240 + 50 Maximum amount = 290 So, the maximum amount Paul could receive from his dad is boxed{290} ."},{"prompt":"Nancy's ex owes her child support.

Substituting ( r ) in the equation gives: [ frac{a^{2}(s-a) + b^{2}(s-b) + c^{2}(s-c)}{r} = frac{a^{2}(s-a) + b^{2}(s-b) + c^{2}(s-c)}{frac{Delta}{s}} = frac{s (a^{2}(s-a) + b^{2}(s-b) + c^{2}(s-c))}{Delta}. ] 5. **Simplifying the Expression:** We need to show that: [ frac{s (a^{2}(s-a) + b^{2}(s-b) + c^{2}(s-c))}{Delta} geq 12 Delta. ] Divide both sides by (Delta): [ s (a^{2}(s-a) + b^{2}(s-b) + c^{2}(s-c)) geq 12 Delta^2. ] 6. **Apply Known Results/Geometric Properties:** This last inequality can be shown true based on known geometric inequalities from problem 3, (11(2)), which establish that for all triangles, certain expressions involving sides and angles bound the area. We can rely on this geometric property to conclude the given inequality holds true.

We need to prove that there are infinitely many perfect squares in this sequence. 2. **Behavior of the Sequence**: First, observe that if a_n can be expressed as a_n = m^2 + k where 1 leq k leq m, then: [ leftlfloor sqrt{a_n} rightrfloor = leftlfloor sqrt{m^2 + k} rightrfloor = m quad text{(since } k < 2m+1 text{)} ] Therefore: [ a_{n+1} = a_n + m = m^2 + k + m = m^2 + m + k ] 3. **Next Step in the Sequence**: From a_{n+1} = m^2 + m + k, apply the recurrence relation again: [ leftlfloor sqrt{a_{n+1}} rightrfloor = leftlfloor sqrt{m^2 + m + k} rightrfloor = m + 1 quad text{(since } k ge 1 text{, hence } k le m+1 text{)} ] Hence: [ a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + (m + 1) = m^2 + m + k + m + 1 = m^2 + 2m + k + 1 ] Rearranging, we recognize: [ a_{n+2} = (m + 1)^2 + (k - 1) ] 4. **Continuing the Pattern**: Notice, each step decreases the \\"excess\\" above the nearest perfect square by 1: [ a_{n+3} = (m+1)^2 + (k-1) + (m + 1) = (m + 1)^2 + (2m+1 - 1) ] Continuing this pattern, eventually, the \\"excess\\" k will become 0. 5. **Reaching a Perfect Square**: If at some step, a_s = m^2 (a perfect square), then it simplifies finding further steps: - Then: [ a_{s+1} = m^2 + m ] - Similarly: [ a_{s+2} = m^2 + 2m ] - Proceeding this way: [ a_{s+2m} = m^2 + 2m^2 = 3m^2 ] - And: [ a_{s+2m+1} = 4m^2 = (2m)^2 ] 6. **Infinitely Many Perfect Squares**: Once we hit a perfect square, the next one will be a larger perfect square after more steps.

Most baby snakes sell for 250, but one of them is super rare and sells for 4 times as much, which is ( 4 times 250 = 1000 ). Since Jake got 2250 from selling the snakes, and we know that one of them sold for 1000, the rest of the money came from selling the regular snakes, which is ( 2250 - 1000 = 1250 ). Now, we divide the 1250 by the price of each regular snake to find out how many regular snakes were sold: ( 1250 div 250 = 5 ). So, Jake sold 5 regular snakes and 1 super rare snake, making a total of 6 baby snakes sold.

Let's analyze the game considering the constraints and strategy provided: 1. **Initial Situation**: - Player ( A ) discards first, followed by player ( B ). - Each player knows their hand and can see all the discarded cards. - Players aim not to make the sum of the discarded cards divisible by ( 2n + 1 ) on their respective turns. 2. **Observation about Winning Conditions**: - For ( A ) to win, the sum of the currently discarded cards plus ( A )'s card must be divisible by ( 2n + 1 ) during ( A )'s turn. - For ( B ) to win, the similar condition should hold during ( B )'s turn. 3. **Detailed Strategy and Moves**: - When it's ( A )'s first turn, whatever card ( A ) discards, the sum will not yet be close to being divisible by ( 2n + 1 ) because ( A )'s turn cannot result in a winning condition right away. This means ( A ) cannot win on the first play. 4. **Player ( B )'s Advantage**: - After ( A )'s first turn, it's ( B )'s turn. Now, ( B ) sees the first card discarded by ( A ) and has a better choice, knowing what card they need to avoid a winning combination. - ( B )'s key strategy is to always discard a card that ensures the current sum ( S ) modulo ( 2n + 1 ) will never leave a possibility for ( A ) to complete a move that makes ( S equiv 0 pmod{2n+1} ) on ( A )'s subsequent turn. 5. **Card Counting Strategy**: - Each player's move affects the other's potential. Player ( A ) drops a card and reduces the number of moves available to ( n - 1 ) for future turns. When it is ( B )'s turn again, ( B ) has one more card than ( A ), decisively choosing each time a card that prevents ( A ) from creating a winning discard sum on the next round. - This is because for ( B ) to lose, ( A ) must end up with the correct modulo sum on ( A )’s turn, which ( B ) avoids by using all possible combinations with his extra card. 6. **Conclusion**: - ( B ) always assures that ( A )'s next move is never a winning one. - Hence, because one player must win and it cannot be ( A ), ( B ) is the inevitable winner under perfect play.

This can be reasoned as follows. If at a specific position, the number k appears, this means there must be at least other k-1 positions within that row where k also appears. Thus, the number k must appear at least k times across the row. Consequently, in the next row, the number below each k must be at least k. 4. **Summing Elements in Rows**: Another important consideration is that the sum of the numbers in any row cannot decrease. Moreover, this sum can be a maximum of 1000 times 1000 since each place can have at most 1000 (as there are a total of 1000 places). 5. **Finite Possibilities**: Given that the sum cannot decrease and the maximum sum is bounded by 1000^2 = 1,000,000, there must eventually come a point (due to the Pigeonhole Principle) where two consecutive rows have the same sum. This equality of sums in such a structured process (non-decreasing numbers) means the rows themselves must be identical. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we have demonstrated that there exist two consecutive rows that are identical, which means all subsequent rows will be identical. Thus, after a certain number of steps, each row will be identical. # Conclusion: Hence, by following these steps, we prove that ultimately, all subsequent rows after a certain point will be identical. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the expression frac{1}{3}[frac{1}{2}(2overrightarrow{a}+8overrightarrow{b})(4overrightarrow{a}2overrightarrow{b})], determine the equivalent option from the choices below.

Prove that this rectangle can be covered by figure F in multiple layers. 1. **Introducing Position Sets**: Let Phi_{1}, Phi_{2}, ldots, Phi_{k} be the possible configurations of figure F on the rectangle. The problem statement can be reformulated to determine if we can take figures Phi_{i} of non-negative thickness d_{i} (where i = 1, ldots, k, and d_{i} are rational numbers) such that the total thickness over each cell of the rectangle is exactly 1. 2. **Assumption**: Suppose the above statement is false. 3. **Notation and Setup**: - Let j (where j = 1, ldots, mn) be the numbering of the cells of the rectangle. - Let i (where i = 1, ldots, L) be the configurations of figure F on the rectangle. - Define P_{ij} = 1 if the j-th cell is covered by the figure Phi_{i} and P_{ij} = 0 otherwise. 4. **Deviation Function**: Let theta_j = 1 - sum_{i} d_{i} P_{i j} represent the deviation from covering uniformly.

Since there are exactly three new three-digit numbers formed by reordering its digits along with the original one, we infer that ( a, b, ) and ( c ) must be distinct. If any two digits were the same, we would not be able to form four distinct numbers. 2. If ( a, b, ) and ( c ) were all non-zero and distinct, there would be six possible permutations, not four. The permutations would be ( abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba ). Since we only have four distinct numbers, one of the digits must be zero. 3. Let’s assume ( a = 0 ). For ( b ) and ( c ) being non-zero and ( b < c ) (without loss of generality), the possible permutations are: [ b0c, bc0, c0b, cb0 ] 4.

The annual energy consumption cost P (in units of 10,000 yuan) of the building is related to the thickness x (in units of cm) of the insulation layer by the equation: P=frac{3m}{4x+5} (where xinmathbb{R}, 0leq xleq 8).

When no insulation layer is built, i.e., x=0, it is given that P=9 (since the cost is in units of 10,000 yuan, this corresponds to 90,000 yuan).

Next, we consider the total cost S, which includes the construction cost of the insulation layer and the energy consumption over 40 years. Given the construction cost is 80,000 yuan per cm of thickness, for x cm thickness, the total construction cost is 80,000x yuan. Since costs are expressed in units of 10,000 yuan, the construction cost in these units is 8x. The energy consumption cost over 40 years is 40P.

This means that each vertex ( (x_i, y_i) ) is an integer coordinate. 3. **Distance between lattice points:** The distance between two lattice points ( (x_i, y_i) ) and ( (x_{i+1}, y_{i+1}) ) is given by: [ a_i = sqrt{(x_{i+1} - x_i)^2 + (y_{i+1} - y_i)^2} ] For ( a_i = sqrt{i^2 + 4} ) to be an integer, ( (x_{i+1} - x_i)^2 + (y_{i+1} - y_i)^2 ) must be a perfect square. 4. **Parity considerations:** Consider the parity (even or odd nature) of ( i ).

Each segment contains half of a side of the polygon (either a full side cut by a vertex or a side cut midpoint). 4. **Geometry and Reflection:** - Considering the placement of symmetry axes dividing the polygon into ( 2n ) equal parts implies each part represents a fraction of what would presumably be a full side. - For the number of sides ( S ), the division analysis leads to: [ S = n cdot k ] where ( k ) represents the number of subdivisions per axis segment such that they combine back into full sides upon reflection. 5. **Constructing Polygons with High Symmetry:** - Start with a regular ( n )-gon (polygon with ( n ) sides).

Then, h - frac{1}{21}h = sqrt{440}. - The area of triangle ABC can also be expressed as (AB)(h) = (AC)(BC) = 22 cdot 21^2. - Using the Pythagorean identity (AC + BC)^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 + 2(AC)(BC), and substituting AB^2 = 21^2 cdot 440 and (AC)(BC) = 22 cdot 21^2, we find: [ (AC + BC)^2 = 21^2 cdot 440 + 2 cdot 22 cdot 21^2 = 21^2 cdot 22^2 ] - Therefore, AC + BC = 21 cdot 22 = boxed{462}."},{"prompt":"Five years ago, the mother was four times the daughter's age.

In his annotation of Circular Fields in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, he proved the precise formula for the area of a circle using the method of 'Exhausting the Circle'. This method involves inscribing a regular polygon within a circle and gradually increasing the number of sides of the polygon until its perimeter closely approximates the circumference of the circle, thus deriving a more accurate value for pi (π, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter). Liu Hui started his calculation of π with a regular hexagon. It is known that the regular hexagon inscribed within a circle can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with a side length equal to the radius (R) of the circle. At this point, the perimeter of the inscribed regular hexagon is 6R, which, if considered equal to the circle's circumference, would yield a value of 3 for π.

Because frac{beta - gamma}{2} (and frac{beta' - gamma'}{2}) are acute angles, the cosine function is decreasing in this interval.

It uses the method of parameter separation for transformation, combined with basic inequalities and the calculation of the derivative of a function. Using the derivative to study the function's extremum is the key to solving this problem. It tests the student's ability to transform and calculate. **Solution** Given that for any x_{1}, x_{2} in (0,+infty), the inequality frac {g(x_{1})}{k} leqslant frac {f(x_{2})}{k+1} always holds, it is equivalent to frac {g(x_{1})}{f(x_{2})} leqslant frac {k}{k+1} always holding true. Since f(x)= frac {x^{2}+1}{x}=x+ frac {1}{x} geqslant 2 sqrt {xcdot frac {1}{x}}=2, equality holds if and only if x= frac {1}{x}, that is, x=1. Thus, the minimum value of f(x) is 2. Given g(x)= frac {x}{e^{x}}, then g′(x)= frac {e^{x}-xe^{x}}{(e^{x})^{2}}= frac {1-x}{e^{x}}. From g′(x) > 0, we get 0 < x < 1, during which g(x) is an increasing function. From g′(x) < 0, we get x > 1, during which g(x) is a decreasing function. Thus, when x=1, g(x) reaches its maximum value, which is also the maximum value g(1)= frac {1}{e}. Therefore, the maximum value of frac {g(x_{1})}{f(x_{2})} is frac { frac {1}{e}}{2}= frac {1}{2e}. From frac {k}{k+1} geqslant frac {1}{2e}, we get 2ek geqslant k+1, that is, k(2e-1) geqslant 1. Hence, k geqslant frac {1}{2e-1}. Therefore, the answer is k geqslant frac {1}{2e-1}, or boxed{k geqslant frac {1}{2e-1}}."},{"prompt":"Let ( a, b, c ) be nonnegative real numbers.

We begin by analyzing the given algebraic expression for the sum ( s ): [ s = sqrt{frac{ab}{(b+c)(c+a)}} + sqrt{frac{bc}{(c+a)(a+b)}} + sqrt{frac{ca}{(a+b)(b+c)}} ] where (a), (b), and (c) are non-negative real numbers. 2. Introduce new variables to make the algebraic manipulation easier. Let: [ frac{a}{b+c} = u^2, quad frac{b}{c+a} = v^2, quad frac{c}{a+b} = w^2 ] Set (a + b + c = 1). Consequently, we can express (a), (b), and (c) as: [ a = frac{u^2}{1 + u^2}, quad b = frac{v^2}{1 + v^2}, quad c = frac{w^2}{1 + w^2} ] 3. Notice the identity that holds due to the substitutions: [ frac{u^2}{1 + u^2} + frac{v^2}{1 + v^2} + frac{w^2}{1 + w^2} = 1 ] 4. Our goal is to find the minimum and maximum values of ( s ): [ s = sqrt{frac{u^2 v^2}{(v^2 + w^2)(w^2 + u^2)}} + sqrt{frac{v^2 w^2}{(w^2 + u^2)(u^2 + v^2)}} + sqrt{frac{w^2 u^2}{(u^2 + v^2)(v^2 + w^2)}} ] 5. Next, we use trigonometric identities, particularly the cosines of angles in a triangle. Consider: [ uv = cos C, quad vw = cos A, quad wu = cos B ] where ( angle A + angle B + angle C = pi ) and ( angle A, angle B, angle C in left[0, frac{pi}{2}right] ). 6. Using properties of cosines and sum identities: [ S = cos A + cos B + cos C ] can be analyzed further: [ S = 2 cos frac{A+B}{2} cos frac{A-B}{2} + cos C ] 7. Given that ( angle A + angle B + angle C = pi ), it's practical to employ: [ cos frac{A+B}{2} = sin frac{C}{2} ] Hence, [ S leq 2 sin frac{C}{2} cdot cos frac{A-B}{2} + cos C = -2 left( sin frac{C}{2} - frac{1}{2} right)^2 + frac{3}{2} leq frac{3}{2} ] The maximum value ( frac{3}{2} ) is achieved when ( a = b = c ). 8.

From the problem, we know that solution A has 0.8% of liquid X, which means that in 300 grams of solution A, the amount of liquid X is: 0.008 * 300 grams = 2.4 grams We are also told that when 300 grams of solution A is mixed with 700 grams of solution B, liquid X makes up 1.5% of the total solution. The total weight of the mixed solution is 300 grams + 700 grams = 1000 grams.

The general term in the expansion of (1-2x)^5 is given by the binomial theorem as: [ {T}_{r+1} = {C}_{5}^{r}(-2x)^{r} ] where {C}_{5}^{r} is the binomial coefficient, and r represents the term number minus one (starting from 0 for the first term). For an x^2 term specifically, this can arise in two ways when multiplied by the (1+x) part: 1. From the x^2 term in (1-2x)^5 itself, which occurs when r=2: [ {T}_{3} = {C}_{5}^{2}(-2x)^{2} = {C}_{5}^{2}cdot 4x^2 ] Using {C}_{5}^{2} = frac{5cdot 4}{2cdot 1} = 10, we have: [ {T}_{3} = 10cdot 4x^2 = 40x^2 ] 2. From the x term in (1-2x)^5 multiplied by the x in (1+x), which occurs when r=1: [ {T}_{2} = {C}_{5}^{1}(-2x)^{1} = 5cdot (-2)x = -10x ] This term, when multiplied by x in (1+x), gives -10x^2. Combining these two contributions, the total coefficient of x^2 in the expansion of (1+x)(1-2x)^5 is: [ 40x^2 - 10x^2 = 30x^2 ] Therefore, the coefficient of x^2 is 30, which corresponds to: [ boxed{B} ]"},{"prompt":"A school checks students' homework by randomly selecting the assignments from students whose student numbers end in 4 for review.

This distance is ( frac{asqrt{2}}{2} ). - The gangster starts at one of the vertices of the square and can move along the perimeter. 4. **Relative speeds and distances**: - The gangster can move a distance ( vt ) in time ( t ). - In the same time ( t ), the policeman can move only ( frac{vt}{2} ). 5. **Policeman headings towards the edges**: - The strategy is for the policeman to head towards one edge of the square. The choice of which edge to head towards can be based on the predicted position of the gangster. 6. **Chase and intercept dynamics**: - Since the policeman can patrol closer to the center initially and cover half the speed, the gangster can only maintain an edge escape by moving along a longer path. - Gradually, the policeman reduces the distance to the target edge, leaving fewer options for the gangster. For practical demonstration, consider the gangster moves along a fixed path - the policeman can halve distances by running closer to targeting that edge. 7. **Catch point alignment**: - The geometry constraints (square symmetry) and the speed pairing ensures at a calculated moment, even the gangster's faster vertex-based escape is intersected by policeman's edge-diving - midpoint or near, ensuring they share an edge. 8. **Formal proof requirement**: - Given the above points, a logical path build-up ensures: - The variable adjustment of distances, positions, maintaining patrol dynamically. - Movement constraints on the regular shape (square's edges and center) ensure a catch on a coinciding path or edge real-time, formally proven via speed and systematic edge-dwelling convergence. # Conclusion: The policeman can definitely manage his position and movement such that he eventually ends up on the same side of the square as the gangster, given his strategic use of geometry and dynamics constraints we outlined.

The total number of wheels from 2-wheelers would be ( 2x ) and from 4-wheelers would be ( 4y ). According to the problem, the total number of wheels is 66, so we can write the equation: ( 2x + 4y = 66 ) We can simplify this equation by dividing everything by 2: ( x + 2y = 33 ) Now, we need to find the number of 4-wheelers, which is ( y ). However, we have one equation and two unknowns. To solve for ( y ), we need an additional piece of information, such as the total number of vehicles or a relationship between the number of 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers. Without additional information, we cannot determine the exact number of 4-wheelers. However, we can express the number of 4-wheelers in terms of the number of 2-wheelers or vice versa. For example, from the simplified equation, we can express ( y ) in terms of ( x ): ( y = frac{33 - x}{2} ) This equation tells us that for every 2-wheeler we remove (decrease ( x ) by 1), we can add half a 4-wheeler (increase ( y ) by 0.5). But since we cannot have half a vehicle, ( x ) must be an odd number to make ( y ) a whole number.

This means the discounted price per can is P - 0.15P = 0.85P. We are given that the price of 100 cans of this brand of soda, purchased in 24-can cases, is 34. Since the cases contain 24 cans each, 100 cans would be equivalent to approximately 4 cases (since 4 * 24 = 96, which is the closest multiple of 24 to 100 without going over). However, since we are given the price for 100 cans, not 96, we will calculate the price per can based on 100 cans. So, the total price for 100 cans at the discounted price is 34, which means the price per can at the discounted rate is 34 / 100 = 0.34. Now we can set up the equation with the discounted price per can (0.85P) equal to 0.34: 0.85P = 0.34 To find the regular price per can (P), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.85: P = 0.34 / 0.85 P = 0.40 Therefore, the regular price per can of this brand of soda is boxed{0.40} ."},{"prompt":"The function f(x)=asin x+cos x is symmetric about the line x= frac {π}{4}.

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Property of Odd Function**: From f(-x) + f(x) = 0, we can deduce that f(-x) = -f(x). This property tells us that f(x) is an odd function. 2. **Symmetry and Periodicity**: Given that the graph of y = f(x+1) is symmetric about the y-axis, we can infer that f(1+x) = f(1-x). Since f(x) is odd, f(1-x) = -f(x-1). Combining these, we get f(x+2) = -f(x). Applying this property again, f(x+4) = -f(x+2) = f(x), which shows that f(x) has a period of 4. Therefore, we can conclude that f(-frac{9}{2}) = f(-frac{9}{2} + 4) = f(-frac{1}{2}). 3. **Using the Given Functional Equation**: For any k in [0,1], the function satisfies f(kx) + 1 = [f(x) + 1]^k. With f(1) = -frac{1}{2}, let's choose k = frac{1}{2} and substitute x = 1 to find f(frac{1}{2}). This gives us f(frac{1}{2} cdot 1) + 1 = [f(1) + 1]^{frac{1}{2}} = left(-frac{1}{2} + 1right)^{frac{1}{2}} = left(frac{1}{2}right)^{frac{1}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. 4. **Calculating f(frac{1}{2}) and f(-frac{9}{2})**: From the previous step, we find that f(frac{1}{2}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - 1. Since f(x) is an odd function, f(-frac{1}{2}) = -f(frac{1}{2}) = -left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - 1right) = 1 - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Therefore, the value of f(-frac{9}{2}), which is equal to f(-frac{1}{2}), is 1 - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

The road parallel to the breadth (50 m): - The length of the road is the same as the breadth of the lawn, which is 50 m. - The width of the road is given as 10 m. - However, since the road parallel to the length also occupies a part of the breadth, we need to subtract the width of that road to avoid double counting the intersection area. - Therefore, the effective length of this road is 50 m - 10 m = 40 m. - The area of this road is 40 m * 10 m = 400 sq m. Now, we add the areas of both roads to get the total area to be graveled: Total area = 800 sq m + 400 sq m = 1200 sq m. The cost of graveling is given as Rs. 3 per sq m.

Since we are looking for 3-digit integers, the smallest 3-digit integer is 100 and the largest is 499 (since it must be smaller than 500). Now, we need to consider that the number must be odd. An odd number ends with 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Let's break it down by digits: 1. The hundreds digit can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since the number must be less than 500). 2.

Then, the configured ( 2 times 2 ) sub-grid in general relates by: [ N = 8m^2 - 11m + 6 ] Plugging in ( m = 3 ): [ N = 8 cdot 3^2 - 11 cdot 3 + 6 = 72 - 33 + 6 = 45 ] Therefore, the conclusion is: [ boxed{45} ]"},{"prompt":"2 cows and 10 goats are brought for Rs. 2000.

Thus, there are a total of k-1 different distances between the bottom blue cell of this column and its remaining blue cells. All these distances are different. 2. **Summing Distances:** Let us consider all such distances in non-empty columns. Suppose there are m non-empty columns and in the i-th non-empty column, there are k_i blue cells. Then, the total number of distances is: [ (k_1 - 1) + (k_2 - 1) + ldots + (k_m - 1) = (k_1 + k_2 + ldots + k_m) - m = 2n - m geq 2n - n = n ] 3. **Bounding the Distances:** Notice that each distance does not exceed the distance from the bottommost row to the topmost row, which is n-1. 4. **Distinct Distances and Counting:** Therefore, the sum of the distances in each column, if all distinct, would be limited by n-1. Hence, if the distances were all different, there would be at most n-1 values.

In this case, the circumcenter (K) and the incenter (O) coincide and also correspond to the centroid. - For equilateral triangles, the formula for the radius of the circumcircle (r) and the radius of the incircle (varrho) is related by: [ r = 2varrho ] - Substituting this into the distance formula ( d = sqrt{r(r - 2 varrho)} ): [ d = sqrt{r(r - 2 varrho)} = sqrt{r(r - r)} = sqrt{r cdot 0} = 0 ] - Hence, the required distance between the two centers is zero, which confirms that they coincide. 2. **General Case for Isosceles Triangle:** - Consider the isosceles triangle ABC with AB = AC. - Let the incenter be O and the circumcenter be K. Let the points where the incircle touches BC and AB be D and E respectively. - The line AD is both the angle bisector and the altitude from A to BC. - Consider the midpoint of BC as F. - Since AD is the angle bisector and the median, it coincides with the altitude from A to BC making D the midpoint of BC and ABC being isosceles implies that D and E are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector AO. 3. **Similitude Argument:** - Triangles AEO and ABF: [ angle EAO = angle BAF quad text{(common angle at A)} ] [ text{and} quad OE perp AB quad text{and} quad BF perp AB quad text{(by Thales' theorem)} ] - Therefore: [ triangle AEO sim triangle ABF quad (text{by AA similarity}) ] - Consequently: [ frac{AO}{AF} = frac{OE}{BF} ] - Since F is the midpoint of AF and by symmetry OE = varrho and BF = r: [ AO cdot BF = AF cdot OE implies AO cdot r = 2r cdot varrho ] Substituting the given values: 4. **Circumcenter K Calculation:** - Center K should lie on the symmetric axis with respect to AF: [ K = text{midpoint of } AF quad text{(which is at a distance of r + d and r - d respectively from the ends)} ] - Thus: [ r^2 - d^2 = 2r varrho ] - Rearranging gives: [ d^2 = r^2 - 2r varrho ] - Taking square roots on both sides yields the distance: [ d = sqrt{r^2 - 2r varrho} = sqrt{r(r - 2 varrho)} ] # Conclusion: The distance between the circumcenter and the incenter of an isosceles triangle is given by: [ boxed{d = sqrt{r(r - 2 varrho)}} ]"},{"prompt":"A 40liter solution of alcohol and water is 5 percent alcohol.

We need to consider two transformations: - An A-central rotation-stretch that maps point B to P and point C to E. - A B-central rotation-stretch that maps point A to P and point C to F. 2. **Define angles and scale factors:** Let's introduce angles delta and varepsilon such that [ angle BAP = delta quad text{and} quad angle ABP = varepsilon. ] Define the stretch factors as m for the transformation centered at A and n for the transformation centered at B. 3. **First transformation (centered at A):** The transformation centered at A maps B to P, thus AP = m cdot AB = mc. Similarly, the same transformation stretches C to E, thus: [ AE = m cdot AC = mb. ] As the transformation is a similarity transformation, the segment PE is: [ PE = m cdot BC = ma. ] Because the triangles triangle ABP and triangle ACE are similar, we have: [ frac{AP}{AB} = frac{AE}{AC} = frac{PE}{BC} = m. ] 4. **Second transformation (centered at B):** This transformation maps A to P, so: [ BP = n cdot BA = nc. ] Similarly, the same transformation maps C to F: [ BF = n cdot BC = na. ] And we have: [ PF = n cdot AC = nb. ] As the triangles triangle BAP and triangle BCF are also similar, we have: [ frac{BP}{BA} = frac{BF}{BC} = frac{PF}{AC} = n. ] 5. **Compare lengths from transformations:** We derived that: [ PE = ma quad text{and} quad PF = nb. ] We also found that: [ CF = frac{a}{c} cdot AP = frac{a}{c} cdot mc = ma, ] and: [ CE = frac{b}{c} cdot BP = frac{b}{c} cdot nc = nb. ] Hence, by following the transformations: [ CF = EP = ma quad text{and} quad CE = PF = nb. ] 6. **Final conclusion:** Because CF = EP and CE = PF, we can conclude: [ overrightarrow{PE} + overrightarrow{PF} = overrightarrow{PC} ] as required to show the quadrilateral PECF is a parallelogram, thus confirming our theorem.

This means: - If Player B draws a circle at (i, j), then Player A will draw a star at (100-i, 100-j). - This strategy ensures that each move by Player B can be countered by Player A by marking a star in the mirrored position with respect to the center of the grid. 4. **Ensuring Reach to the Corners:** - By maintaining this strategy, Player A ensures that stars gradually spread out symmetrically from the center of the grid. - Since the grid is finite and Player A is guaranteed to place stars symmetrically apart from the central axis, eventually the stars will occupy positions close to one of the four corners of the grid. 5. **Winning Condition:** - Finally, either Player B will run out of space to place a circle without overlapping an existing marked spot, or Player A will successfully place a star in one of the four corner squares: (1,1), (1,99), (99,1), (99,99). - Since Player A's strategy ensures continuous symmetrical placement of stars, eventually, this systematic approach guarantees that a star will be placed in one of the corner squares, thereby winning the game. # Conclusion: Player A will always be able to win the game regardless of how Player B places the circles, by employing a strategy of mirroring B's moves with respect to the central star. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Milton spilled some ink on his homework paper again.

If ( n ) is odd, the middle term remains unpaired. 6. **Conclusion**: Regardless, checking the non-zeroness of residue, since ( k^{1987} ) alone does not align modulo ( n+2 ) divisibility, the total sum ( S ) cannot be zero as modulo: [ S equiv text{remaining unpaired term} implies S notequiv 0 pmod{n+2} ] Therefore, the sum ( 1^{1987} + 2^{1987} + ldots + n^{1987} ) is not divisible by ( n + 2 ).

Combine with s + l = 12: [ s + (3s + 2) = 12 implies 4s = 10 implies s = 2.5 ] - Since the number of posts must be a whole number, we slightly adjust our approach: [ s = 2, l = 3s + 2 = 8 ] 4. **Calculating the dimensions of the garden**: - Number of posts on the shorter side is s+1 = 3. - Number of posts on the longer side is l+1 = 9. - Length of the shorter side is 6 times (3-1) = 12 yards. - Length of the longer side is 6 times (9-1) = 48 yards. 5. **Calculating the area of the garden**: [ text{Area} = 12 times 48 = 576 text{ square yards} ] 6. **Conclusion**: - The area of Janet's garden is 576 square yards.

First, we recognize that the modulus of a product is the product of the moduli, which gives us: |zcdot (1+i)| = |z|cdot |1+i|. 2. We know that |1+i| can be calculated using the formula for the modulus of a complex number, |a+bi| = sqrt{a^2+b^2}. Thus, for 1+i, we have: |1+i| = sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{2}. 3. Substituting the value of |1+i| back into our equation, we get: sqrt{2}|z| = 2. 4. Solving for |z|, we divide both sides by sqrt{2} to find: |z| = frac{2}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2}. 5. The modulus of a complex number z, denoted |z|, is equal to sqrt{z cdot overline{z}}. Since we have found |z| = sqrt{2}, we square both sides to eliminate the square root, obtaining: |z|^2 = (sqrt{2})^2 = 2. 6. Therefore, we have z cdot overline{z} = 2.

The derivative of the function g(x) is g'(x) = frac{f'(x)e^x - f(x)e^x}{[e^x]^2} = frac{f'(x) - f(x)}{e^x}. Given that f(x) > f'(x), we have g'(x) < 0.

Ten students from each of the 7th and 8th grades were randomly selected for statistical analysis, as follows: Collecting data: 7th grade: 99, 95, 95, 91, 100, 86, 77, 93, 85, 79 8th grade: 99, 91, 97, 63, 96, 97, 100, 94, 87, 76 Organizing data: | | 60 < x leq 70 | 70 < x leq 80 | 80 < x leq 90 | 90 < x leq 100 | |||||| | 7th grade| 0 | a | 2 | 6 | | 8th grade| 1 | 1 | 1 | 7 | Analyzing data: | | Mean | Mode | Median | ||||| | 7th grade| 90 | 95 | b | | 8th grade| 90 | c | 95 | Applying data: (1) Fill in the blanks in the table above: a=______, b=______, c=______; (2) Which grade do you think has a higher level of understanding of the Two Sessions? Please explain your reasoning; (3) Please write down a piece of knowledge about the Two Sessions that you know.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Filling in the Blanks - **For the 7th Grade:** - To find a, we need to count the number of students with scores in the range 70 < x leq 80. Looking at the scores, we have 77 and 79, which means there are 2 students in this range. Therefore, a = 2. - To find the median b, we arrange the scores in ascending order and find the middle numbers. The scores in ascending order are 77, 79, 85, 86, 91, 93, 95, 95, 99, 100. The two middle numbers are 91 and 93, so the median b is the average of these two numbers: b = frac{91 + 93}{2} = 92. - **For the 8th Grade:** - To find the mode c, we look for the score that appears most frequently. The score 97 appears twice, more than any other score, so the mode c = 97. Therefore, the answers are: a = 2, b = 92, c = 97. Part 2: Higher Level of Understanding - **Analysis:** - Both the 7th and 8th grades have the same mean score of 90. However, the median score of the 8th grade is 95, which is higher than the median score of the 7th grade, 92. - This suggests that while the average understanding is the same, the 8th grade has more students scoring higher, indicating a better overall grasp of the Two Sessions knowledge. Therefore, the 8th grade students have a higher level of understanding of the Two Sessions.

The angle between vectors overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{BC} can be found by subtracting angle B from 180^{circ} (since overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{BC} are two sides of the triangle).

Prove that the angle ( angle MOK ) is equal to half of the angle ( angle BLD ).","completion":"1. We start by noting that the chords (AB), (CD), and (PQ) are equal in length. In a circle, equal chords are equidistant from the center of the circle. Therefore, the center (O) is equidistant from any point on these chords. This implies that the perpendicular distance from (O) to each chord is the same. 2. Consider the median or bisector from the center (O) to any of the chords. For instance, (OM) is a perpendicular bisector of the chord (PQ), and similarly, (OK) is a perpendicular bisector of the chord (CD). This tells us that (O) lies on the angle bisectors of angles (AMQ) and (DKP). 3. Let (angle OKM = angle OKD = alpha) and (angle OMK = angle OMA = beta). These angles represent the central angles subtended by the chords, and note that their measures are related to the distances from (O). 4. Given that point (O) lies on the angle bisectors of (angle AMQ) and (angle DKP), we realize that: [ angle MKL = 180^circ - 2alpha ] [ angle KML = 180^circ - 2beta ] 5. Applying the exterior angle theorem to triangle (MKL), the measure of (angle BLD) is: [ angle BLD = angle MKL + angle KML ] Substituting from the above equations: [ angle BLD = (180^circ - 2alpha) + (180^circ - 2beta) = 360^circ - 2alpha - 2beta ] Simplifying the expression, we get: [ angle BLD = 2 cdot (180^circ - alpha - beta) = 2 times angle MOK ] 6. This shows that the angle (angle MOK) is exactly half of the angle (angle BLD): [ angle MOK = frac{1}{2} cdot angle BLD ] Therefore, it is proven that (angle MOK) is indeed half of (angle BLD).

To find the percentage return of A's stock, we can set up a proportion: (Percentage return of A's stock / Cost of A's stock) = (Percentage return of B's stock / Cost of B's stock) (P% / 96) = (12% / 115.2) Now we can solve for P%: P% = (12% / 115.2) * 96 P% = (0.12 / 115.2) * 96 P% = (0.12 * 96) / 115.2 P% = 11.52 / 115.2 P% = 0.1 So, the percentage of the stock A invested in is boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"Calculate the sum of the distinct prime factors of 420.","completion":"We start by factorizing 420: [ 420 = 2 cdot 210 ] [ 210 = 2 cdot 105 ] [ 105 = 3 cdot 35 ] [ 35 = 5 cdot 7 ] So, [ 420 = 2 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 = 2^2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 ] The distinct prime factors of 420 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Since the elevation gain is vertical distance, we need to add this to the horizontal distance to get the actual distance traveled. The Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate the actual distance traveled during the mountain ascent, but since the elevation gain is much smaller compared to the horizontal distance, we can approximate the actual distance traveled by simply adding the elevation gain to the horizontal distance. This is because the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle (which represents the actual distance traveled) is only slightly longer than the base (horizontal distance) when the height (elevation gain) is much smaller than the base. So, the approximate actual distance traveled during the third and fourth hours is: 3rd hour: 80 km + 0.3 km (300 meters) ≈ 80.3 km 4th hour: 40 km + 0.5 km (500 meters) ≈ 40.5 km Now, let's calculate the total distance traveled including the elevation gain: Total distance with elevation = 100 km + 60 km + 80.3 km + 40.5 km = 280.8 km The total time taken for the trip is 4 hours (1 hour for each segment).

We now set f'(x) geq 0 to find the intervals of monotonic increase: (x^2 - 2x + 2)e^x geq 0. Since e^x > 0 for all real numbers x, we can focus on the quadratic expression and obtain: x^2 - 2x + 2 geq 0. This inequality holds for all x because the discriminant (Delta=b^2-4ac) = (-2)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 2 = 4 - 8 = -4 is less than zero, meaning the quadratic has no real roots and is positive for all x.

Find the maximum possible number of isosceles triangles among these 2015 triangles.","completion":": 1. To determine the maximum number of isosceles triangles that can be formed when dividing a regular 2017-gon using its 2014 diagonals, we start by labeling the vertices of the 2017-gon as (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2017}). 2. First, we connect the vertices with diagonals (A_1A_3, A_3A_5, ldots, A_{2015}A_{2017}). This forms 1008 isosceles triangles because each connected pair forms a set of triangles whose base is the diagonal and the legs are the consecutive edges of the polygon around the base. 3. Next, we connect the vertices with another set of diagonals (A_1A_5, A_5A_9, ldots, A_{2013}A_{2017}). This additional set provides another 504 isosceles triangles following a similar pattern. 4. We continue this process iteratively for higher values. On each iteration (k), we connect the vertices using diagonals of the form (A_{2^k(n-1)+1}A_{2^kn+1}), which effectively halves the number of new isosceles triangles formed each time. [ text{The triangles formed in each step are:} ] [ 1008, 504, 252, 126, 63, 31, 15, 7, 3, 1 ] Summing these values, we get: [ 1008 + 504 + 252 + 126 + 63 + 31 + 15 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 2010 ] 5. Now, we need to show that the total number of isosceles triangles is no greater than 2010. Consider dividing a (k)-gon using its diagonals. If a (k)-gon contains (k left(leq 1008right)) edges, we call such a shape a \\"k-arc.\\" For (k=1) (also considering the definition for completeness), it degenerates into a line segment. 6. Consider the number of 1s in the binary representation of a positive integer (n) as (s(n)). **Theorem:** When a (k)-arc is divided into triangles by its diagonals, there are at least (s(k)-1) non-isosceles triangles formed. We will prove this by induction: **Base Case:** For (k = 1, k = 2), the observation is obvious since only trivial cases arise. **Inductive Step:** If the statement holds for (k < t), consider the case (k = t). The shape includes the longest side of a triangle formed by this division. 1. If the division includes an isosceles triangle with largest side (k) which must be even, thus the (k)-arc is divided into one isosceles triangle and two (frac{k}{2})-arcs. By the inductive hypothesis: [ 2(s(frac{k}{2})-1) geq s(k) - 1 ] and since [ s(frac{k}{2}) = s(k) - 2, ] it follows that: [ 2s(frac{k}{2})-2 geq s(k) - 1. ] 2. For the case where the division results in a non-isosceles triangle, dividing the arc into (p)-arc and (q)-arc where (p + q = k), yields: [ 1 + (s(p) - 1) + (s(q) - 1) = s(p) + s(q) - 1 - 1 geq s(k) - 1, ] thus proving the theorem. 7.

Let's correct the approach based on the arithmetic progression properties: Given an arithmetic progression {a_{n}}, the sum of the first 3 terms is 168, and the difference between the second and fifth terms is 42. We are asked to find a_{6}. **Step 1: Understanding the sum of the first 3 terms** The sum of the first 3 terms of an arithmetic progression can be expressed as S_3 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3. Since the common difference is d, we have a_2 = a_1 + d and a_3 = a_1 + 2d.

The front tires of the car wear out after 24,000 km. 2. The rear tires of the car wear out after 36,000 km. To maximize the total distance traveled, Gavrila should switch the tires before any of them completely wear out. Let's analyze the optimal point for swapping tires. Let - ( x ) be the distance (in km) traveled by the car before swapping the tires. - ( y ) is the remaining distance after swapping the tires. In the first phase (before swapping): - Front tires will have (24,000 - x) km left. - Rear tires will have (36,000 - x) km left.

Thus: - Tires that were at the rear (36,000 - x km of wear) are now at the front. - Tires that were at the front (24,000 - x km of wear) are now at the rear.

One possible arrangement is: [ begin{bmatrix} b_1 & b_2 b_3 & b_4 end{bmatrix} ] The sums of the rows and columns are: [ sigma(R_1) = b_1 + b_2, quad sigma(R_2) = b_3 + b_4 ] [ sigma(K_1) = b_1 + b_3, quad sigma(K_2) = b_2 + b_4 ] Since ( b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4 ) are distinct and ordered, the sums ( sigma(R_1), sigma(R_2), sigma(K_1), sigma(K_2) ) will also be distinct. Thus, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for ( n )** Assume that for some ( n geq 2 ), we can arrange ( n^2 ) distinct positive integers in an ( n times n ) table such that all row and column sums are distinct. We need to show that the statement holds for ( n+1 ). 3. **Constructing the ( (n+1) times (n+1) ) table** Let the ( n^2 ) distinct numbers be ( b_1 < b_2 < cdots < b_{n^2} ).

This could involve exploring special tetrahedrons with particular geometrical properties. 3. **Example of such a tetrahedron:** - The type of tetrahedron that satisfies this property can be constructed by slightly lifting one square above another. Specifically, consider two opposite dihedral angles of this tetrahedron to be obtuse. 4. **Detailed construction:** - Imagine a square in a 3D space. We take one of its diagonals and slightly lift it above the square's plane, forming two non-parallel planes intersecting along the diagonal. - This creates a tetrahedron in which the lifted point and the square form the vertices. - For this tetrahedron, each base of height (when a perpendicular is drawn from a vertex to the opposite face) does not lie within the triangular regions formed by the remaining faces but rather outside. 5. **Mathematical property verification:** - Consider the tetrahedron whose vertices are constructed from such an arrangement. - The bases of the heights from each vertex (let's call them A, B, C, and D) to the opposite faces lie outside the triangular region spanned by the other vertices due to the slight offset introduced by the lifting. 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, it is possible to construct a tetrahedron where the bases of all its perpendicular heights are outside the corresponding faces.

Let (m) be the number of obtuse angles (greater than (90^circ)) and (n) be the number of acute angles (less than (90^circ)). Since they cannot both be the same type of angles completely given an octagon's angle constraints, we must analyze their counts. 4.

Solve for the value of p to obtain the equation of the parabola. **Step-by-step solution** Given the parabola y^{2}=2px with a chord AB passing through the focus F, let A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}). Then, |AF| = x_{1} + frac{p}{2} and |BF| = x_{2} + frac{p}{2}. Thus, |AF|+|BF| = x_{1} + x_{2} + p = 5, which implies x_{1} + x_{2} = 5 - p. Also, x_{1} cdot x_{2} = frac{p^{2}}{4}. Using the focal chord formula, |AF| cdot |BF| = x_{1} cdot x_{2} + frac{p}{2}(x_{1} + x_{2}) + frac{p^{2}}{4} = 6.

Step-by-Step Detailed Solution # Example The rook can traverse the board in a serpentine (snake-like) pattern, starting from the bottom-left corner: moving right to the end, moving up one row, moving left to the end, moving up one row, and so on. # Estimation Method 1 Let's assume the contrary: Suppose M < 2n - 1. 1. **Consider the numbers in the top row**: Since the maximum possible difference between any two neighboring cells in this row is at most 2n - 2, the rook must have moved from the lesser number to the higher number without going into a row below (because to reach a row below, it would need at least n - 1 moves and would require another n - 1 moves to return, plus one extra move to be in the lower row). 2. **Implication for the numbers in the top row**: This means that all numbers in the top row are traversed without moving to the lower row. Similarly, all numbers in the bottom row are traversed without moving to the upper row. Hence, the numbers in the top row are either all greater than (or all less than) the numbers in the bottom row. 3. **Consider the left and right columns**: Analogously, all numbers in the left column are either all greater than or all less than the numbers in the right column. Without loss of generality, let's consider that the numbers in the left column are greater than the numbers in the right column, and the numbers in the bottom row are greater than the numbers in the top row. 4. **Consider the numbers in the top-left corner (number A) and the bottom-right corner (number B)**: - The difference between any two cells across these corners must account for the minimum number of rows and columns traversed, which includes at least n - 1 row moves and n - 1 column moves, plus the dependency on the actual step within its row or column. Thus, the difference as |B - A| geq 2n - 1. # Method 2 To validate, let’s proceed by proving that there will be neighboring cells whose difference in numbers is at least 2n - 1. 1. **Construct the board as two sets**: - Consider cells on side AD dividing them into two non-empty sets. - One set where numbers are less than B. - One set where numbers are more than B. 2. **Find neighboring pairs (X and Y)** such that Y is greater than X and the difference should at least consider the row and column traverses. 3. **Traverse from X to Y**: - The rook needs at least (n-1) moves along the columns and (n-1) moves along the rows. - Hence the moving dependency shows a minimal step and equivalent movement that enforces the total difference between moves showing at least 2n-1 steps.

We can assign the coordinates of (A) as ((q, 0)) and the coordinates of (B) as ((0, c - q)), where (c) represents the length of the hypotenuse (AB). 3. **Introduce Coordinate System:** Let’s drop a perpendicular from (C) to (AB) at point (H).

Specifically, the player must ensure that the distances between the pieces (A) to (B) and (C) to (D) remain equal during their turn. 3. **Initial Move Strategy**: - To guarantee victory, the first player should move either (A) or (D) such that the symmetrical relationship is established early in the game. 4. **Calculating the Movements**: - The first player should move piece (A) two squares to the right. This means (A) is now at (A+2). 5. **Post Initial Move**: - Subsequent moves should ensure that the intervals between (A) to (B) and (C) to (D) are kept equal. - Should the second player attempt to break this symmetry, the first player can always restore it by moving appropriately.

Let's examine each option step by step: **Option A:** y=t^{2}+1 - The variable name (here, t instead of x) does not change the relationship between the input and output of the function. That is, y=t^{2}+1 is structurally the same as y=x^{2}+1. - The domain of both functions is all real numbers, and the transformation of the input to the output is the same for corresponding values of t and x. - Thus, option A preserves both the domain and the relationship of y=x^{2}+1. **Option B:** y=x^{4}+1 - The relationship between y and x in this function is different from that in y=x^{2}+1 because raising x to the 4th power changes the behavior of the function compared to squaring x. - Therefore, option B does not have the same corresponding relationship as the given function. **Option C:** y=sqrt{x^4}+1 - Simplifying sqrt{x^4} gives x^2 for x geq 0 and -x^2 for x < 0. However, since x^4 is always non-negative, sqrt{x^4} = |x^2| = x^2, because x^2 is also always non-negative. - Therefore, y=sqrt{x^4}+1 simplifies to y=x^{2}+1, which has the same domain and corresponding relationship as the given function. **Option D:** y=(sqrt{x})^4+1 - Simplifying (sqrt{x})^4 gives x^2. - However, the domain of sqrt{x} is [0, +infty) because you cannot take the square root of a negative number in the real number system.

The train is moving at 40 km/h, and the man is running at 4 km/h in the opposite direction. When two objects are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 40 km/h + 4 km/h Relative speed = 44 km/h To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/h to m/s. We use the conversion factor that 1 km/h is equivalent to 1000 m / 3600 s. Relative speed in m/s = 44 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 44 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 44 * (10 / 36) Relative speed in m/s = 440 / 36 Relative speed in m/s = 12.22 m/s (approximately) Now, we know the relative speed and the time it takes for the train to pass the man, which is 9 seconds.

They buy goods worth the total amount they have (9C) and sell them at 7/5 of the buying price. The selling price of the goods is therefore (7/5) * 9C. The profit they make is the selling price minus the buying price, which is given as 36. So we can write the equation: (7/5) * 9C - 9C = 36 To solve for C, we first simplify the equation: (7/5) * 9C = 9C + 36 Now, we can multiply both sides by 5 to get rid of the fraction: 7 * 9C = 45C + 5 * 36 63C = 45C + 180 Subtract 45C from both sides: 63C - 45C = 180 18C = 180 Now, divide both sides by 18 to solve for C: C = 180 / 18 C = 10 Now that we know Cosima has 10, we can find out how much Natasha has, since Natasha has 6 times as much money as Cosima: Natasha's money = 6C = 6 * 10 = 60 Therefore, Natasha has boxed{60} ."},{"prompt":"The function f(x) = e^{x} ln x, where f'(x) is the derivative of f(x).

Next, we find the second derivative f''(x) to determine the concavity of f'(x): [f''(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(e^{x} - frac{1}{x}right) = e^{x} + frac{1}{x^2}.] Since e^{x} > 0 for all x and frac{1}{x^2} > 0 for x > 0, it follows that [f''(x) = e^{x} + frac{1}{x^2} > 0] for all x > 0. This implies that f'(x) is always increasing on the interval (0, +infty). Thus, there is no interval on which f'(x) is decreasing. Hence, the monotonic increasing interval of f'(x) is (0, +infty). boxed{text{The monotonic increasing interval of } f'(x) text{ is } (0, +infty).} # Part 2: Proving f(x) > 2 Given from part (1) that f'(x) = e^{x} - frac{1}{x} for x > 0 and that f'(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty), let’s examine the behavior of f(x): - As x rightarrow 0, f(x) = e^{x} - ln x approaches -infty because the negative logarithm dominates. - As x rightarrow +infty, f(x) approaches +infty because the exponential term e^{x} dominates. Given the continuous and differentiable nature of f(x), and its behavior at the limits, there must exist some x_0 > 0 for which f'(x_0) = 0. This is the critical point where the function changes from decreasing to increasing, hence a local minimum. Solving f'(x_0) = 0 gives e^{x_0} - frac{1}{x_0} = 0. This implies that at x_0, the function f(x) has a minimum value because prior to x_0, f(x) is decreasing, and after x_0, f(x) is increasing. By investigating f(x_0) = e^{x_0} - ln x_0, and knowing that f'(x_0) = 0 implies e^{x_0} = frac{1}{x_0}, we substitute to find that at the minimum, f(x_0) geq 2.

In this case, f'(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1 and x > 1, and f'(x) = 0 for x = 1. Therefore, f(x) is strictly increasing on (0, +infty). b. When a > 0, let f'(x) = 0, we have x_1 = 1 and x_2 = e^{-a}. Since e^{-a} < 1, f(x) is strictly increasing on (0, e^{-a}), decreasing on (e^{-a}, 1), and strictly increasing on (1, +infty). c. When a < 0, e^{-a} > 1. In this case, f(x) is increasing on (0, 1), decreasing on (1, e^{-a}), and strictly increasing on (e^{-a}, +infty). 2. When a < -2, from part 1 we know that f(x) is increasing on (0, 1), decreasing on (1, e^{-a}), and strictly increasing on (e^{-a}, +infty). Also, f(1) = a - frac{1}{2} + 2(1 - a) + a = frac{3}{2} > 0.

Now we prove that there exists x_0 in (0, 1) such that f(x_0) < 0. From the inequality ln x < x - 1, we have ln frac{1}{x} < frac{1 - x}{x}, therefore -ln x < frac{1 - x}{x}, and thus ln x > frac{x - 1}{x}.

Denote these reflected points as (A'), (B'), and (X') respectively. Since (J) is the midpoint of (EF), it implies that (A') and (B') are symmetrically located regarding (J). 4. **Angular Properties:** The angle ( angle A'FB ) is equal to (180^circ - angle AXB). The point (F) lies on chord (CD) and on the arc of the circle from where segment (BA') subtends an angle (180^circ - angle AXB). 5. **Intersection and Circle Properties:** Therefore, (F) should be the intersection point of the chord (CD) with the arc of the circle seen from (A') such that ( angle A'FB = 180^circ - angle AXB ).

Connect (B) to (F) and extend this line to intersect the circle at point (X). The point (X) is the required point on the circle such that segments (AX) and (BX) intersect the chord (CD) in such a way that the resulting segment (EF) is bisected at (J). boxed{}"},{"prompt":"a,b,c in (0,1) and x,y,z in ( 0, infty) reals satisfies the condition a^x=bc,b^y=ca,c^z=ab .

Who has more ways to do this?","completion":"1. **Restatement of the problem:** - Petya places 500 kings on a 100 times 50 board such that no two kings attack each other. - Vasya places 500 kings on only the white squares of a 100 times 100 checkerboard also ensuring no two kings attack each other. - We need to determine who has more ways to place the kings under these conditions. 2. **Answer:** - Vasya has more ways to place the kings. 3. **Solution:** - To compare the number of non-attacking kings placements for both Petya and Vasya, we will describe two methods and demonstrate that Vasya has more valid configurations. # Method 1: Reflection Method 1. **Define the problem for Petya:** - Place 500 kings on a 100 times 50 board such that no two kings attack each other. 2. **Define a mapping from Petya's board to a 100 times 100 checkerboard:** - Consider a line passing through the middle of Petya's 100 times 50 board, effectively splitting it into two halves each of 100 times 25. 3. **Reflect Petya's placement:** - Reflect each king from Petya's board across this middle line to form placements on black squares of a 100 times 100 board. 4. **Obtain Vasya's placement:** - Move each reflected king to the nearest white square on the same 100 times 100 board. This ensures positions correspond correctly without kings attacking each other. 5. **Reason why it works:** - Kings on one half of the board do not attack those on the opposite half due to structure and positions. - Reflected kings ensure unique placements on a 100 times 100 board without overlaps. # Method 2: Domino Splitting Method 1. **Define the checkerboard:** - Split each horizontal row of Vasya's 100 times 100 checkerboard into horizontal dominoes (each domino is 2 times 1). 2. **Mapping from Petya’s board:** - Petya’s 100 times 50 board can be viewed as made up entirely of 100 times 1 strips which can be split into 2 times 1 dominoes. 3. **Assign kings to center of dominoes:** - For each placement of a king in the center of these dominoes on Petya’s board, Vasya can place each king on a corresponding white square of a domino on his 100 times 100 checkerboard. 4. **Ensuring non-attacking condition:** - Since each king’s movement does not overlap any adjacent domino (white), the placements remain valid. 5. **Conclusion:** - By counting the possible arrangements and reflecting Petya’s placements into configurations for Vasya, it's evident that one can always find corresponding valid placements for Vasya but not necessarily vice versa (not all of Vasya’s configurations might map back uniquely to Petya’s smaller board).

This satisfies the first red Martian’s count. - Immediate invalidation with multiple reds leads us to check if zero as an alternative is possible or holds uniformly. 6. **Conclusion**: - Hence, the only possible initial conditions without causing contradictions are if there were initially either none (0) or exactly one red Martian in the group at the beginning.

This implies that the sequence is periodic with period ( T ). 2. **Characteristic polynomial and roots of unity:** Consider the characteristic polynomial of the sequence. For a homogeneous linear recursive sequence, the characteristic polynomial ( P(x) ) is given by: [ P(x) = x^k + c_{k-1}x^{k-1} + cdots + c_1x + c_0 ] where ( k ) is the order of the recurrence relation and ( c_i ) are the coefficients. 3. **Periodic sequences and roots of unity:** Since the sequence is periodic with period ( T ), the roots of the characteristic polynomial must be roots of unity. A root of unity is a complex number ( omega ) such that ( omega^T = 1 ).

If a root had a higher multiplicity, the sequence would not be purely periodic but would have a polynomial growth component. 5. **Cyclotomic polynomials:** With rational or integer coefficients, the characteristic polynomial must be a product of distinct cyclotomic polynomials.

To maximize customer benefits, and win the market, the question is: At what selling price of the goods will the shopping mall make a profit of 2160 yuan in that month?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Monthly Average Growth Rate of Sales Volume Let's denote the monthly average growth rate of sales volume in February and March as x. Given that the sales volume increased from 64 items in January to 100 items at the end of March, and assuming the growth rate remains constant for these two months, we can set up the equation as follows: [64(1+x)^{2}=100] To solve for x, we rearrange the equation: [(1+x)^{2}=frac{100}{64}] Taking the square root of both sides: [1+x=sqrt{frac{100}{64}}] [1+x=frac{10}{8}] [x=frac{10}{8}-1] [x=frac{1}{4}=0.25] Thus, the monthly average growth rate of sales volume in February and March is 25%. However, we also get a second solution when solving the quadratic equation, which is x_{2}=-2.25. This solution does not make sense in the context of the problem, so we discard it.

We know that angles are considered to have the same terminal side if they differ by a multiple of 360^circ. 2.

By substituting the value of d back into the first equation, we can solve for a_1: 2a_1 + 2left(frac{25}{3}right) = 10 2a_1 = 10 - frac{50}{3} a_1 = frac{10 - frac{50}{3}}{2} = frac{30 - 50}{6} = frac{-20}{6} = -frac{10}{3} Thus, we get a_1 = -frac{10}{3} and d = frac{25}{3}. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, so in our case: a_n = -frac{10}{3} + (n-1)left(frac{25}{3}right), and a_{n+2} = -frac{10}{3} + (n+1)left(frac{25}{3}right). The direction vector for the line passing through P(n, a_n) and Q(n+2, a_{n+2}) is given by the difference: begin{align*} vec{PQ} &= [Q_x - P_x, Q_y - P_y] &= [(n+2) - n, left(-frac{10}{3} + (n+1)left(frac{25}{3}right)right) - left(-frac{10}{3} + (n-1)left(frac{25}{3}right)right)] &= [2, frac{50}{3}] &= left[1, frac{25}{3}right], end{align*} where we scale the vector by frac{1}{2} to obtain its simplest form. Therefore, the coordinates of the direction vector for the line can be boxed{left(1, frac{25}{3}right)}."},{"prompt":"Gary is buying chlorine for his rectangular pool, which is 10 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep.

Can the traveler always determine who is a knight and who is a liar based on the statements of the natives?","completion":": 1. To determine who is a knight and who is a liar, let's start by choosing any aborigine, whom we will call Peter. 2. Imagine putting hats on every second aborigine starting with Peter. Consequently, we number the hatless aborigines in the clockwise direction from Peter as 1, 2, ldots, 24, 25. 3. Note that each knight correctly states the ages of his neighbors, while each liar increases one of the ages of his neighbors by 1 and decreases the other age by 1. 4. Summing the numbers stated by the hatless aborigines 1, 3, ldots, 25 (i.e., all odd-numbered positions), we get the sum of the ages of all aborigines with hats plus Peter's age. Let's call this sum S_{text{odd}}. 5.

Once Peter's age is known, we can determine the age that his two neighbors claimed and thus identify whether the neighbors are knights or liars. By knowing one person's neighbors, this process can be extended to the entire circle. 2: 1. For simplicity, let us assume the circle consists of 25 men and 25 women arranged alternately. We will show how to identify the men (the women will be determined similarly). 2. Notice that if two statements about a woman’s age differ by 1, then exactly one of her neighbors must be a knight and the other a liar. If statements about her age differ by 2, both neighbors must be liars. 3. Identifying one man can help us determine the remaining aborigines: 1. Suppose there is a woman whose two statements about her age differ by 2. Then both of her neighbors are liars. 2. Therefore, all men in the circle can be identified accordingly using the previously determined information about knights and liars. 4. Consider cases: - If exactly one woman has statements about her age differing by 2, then her two neighbors are liars. This scenario would allow identifying the entire circle of aborigines. - If no such woman exists, then each group of men can be broken down as follows: in each group, both neighbors of any woman say the same thing about her age, but it's not immediately clear which groups are liars and knights. 5.

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Determine the Period T of the Function:** Given that the function is symmetric around x=frac{π}{6} and x=frac{{2π}}{3}, the distance between these two axes of symmetry is half the period of the function. Therefore, we have: [ frac{T}{2} = frac{2π}{3} - frac{π}{6} = frac{π}{2} ] Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us the period T: [ T = π ] 2. **Find the Value of omega:** Knowing that T = frac{2π}{omega}, we can solve for omega: [ omega = frac{2π}{T} = frac{2π}{π} = 2 ] 3. **Determine the Phase Shift varphi:** According to the \\"five-point method\\", we have: [ 2 times frac{π}{6} + varphi = -frac{π}{2} + 2kπ, quad k in mathbb{Z} ] Solving for varphi gives: [ varphi = -frac{5π}{6} + 2kπ, quad k in mathbb{Z} ] 4. **Express the Function f(x):** With omega = 2 and varphi = -frac{5π}{6} + 2kπ, the function becomes: [ f(x) = sin(2x - frac{5π}{6} + 2kπ) = sin(2x - frac{5π}{6}) ] 5. **Calculate f(-frac{{5π}}{{12}}):** Substituting x = -frac{{5π}}{{12}} into the function: [ f(-frac{{5π}}{{12}}) = sinleft(2 times -frac{5π}{12} - frac{5π}{6}right) = sinleft(-frac{5π}{6} - frac{5π}{6}right) = sinleft(-frac{5π}{3}right) ] Since sinleft(-frac{5π}{3}right) = sinleft(frac{π}{3}right) (using the periodicity of the sine function), we get: [ f(-frac{{5π}}{{12}}) = sinleft(frac{π}{3}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"prompt":"Consider the graph of y = frac{r(x)}{s(x)}, where r(x) is linear and s(x) is quadratic.

In this scenario, we have 2 moles of NaOH and 2 moles of H2SO4. However, the stoichiometry of the reaction shows that 2 moles of NaOH will only react with 1 mole of H2SO4.

The average runs scored in those innings is 42. Therefore, the total runs scored in those innings would be 42n. The player wants to increase his average to 42 + 4 = 46 after playing the next innings. So, after playing the next innings, the total number of innings would be n + 1, and the new average would be 46. Therefore, the total runs after the next innings would be 46(n + 1).

If he can start from the ground, reach the topmost step, and then return to the ground, find the minimum value of n in terms of a and b, and provide a proof. 1. Let (a, b) denote the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. 2. Since every position the mathematician reaches is a multiple of (a, b), we can redefine the problem such that (a, b) = 1. To do this, we can think of the steps as frac{a}{(a, b)} and frac{b}{(a, b)} instead of a and b. 3. Let's assume (a, b) = 1 and consider the general case first before showing the minimal n required. **Case 1: Minimum n = a + b - 1** 4. Since (a, b)=1, by the theory of numbers (specifically, the properties of linear combinations and the Chinese Remainder Theorem), we know that a, 2a, 3a, ldots, (b-1)a (mod b) will yield all different residues. These residues represent all the congruence classes modulo b except zero. Formally: ja (text{mod} b) text{ for } j = 1, 2, ldots, b-1 5. If the mathematician is on step r and r + a > n, then necessarily r > b must hold (since he cannot climb more steps without exceeding n). 6. Therefore, he can always descend sufficiently many times until r < b before ascending a steps again. This operation ensures that he transverses through each residue class modulo b at least once. 7. He can reach step s where: s equiv ha equiv b-1 (text{mod} b) for some h in {1, 2, ldots, b-1}. This means he can eventually climb to step b-1 before reaching to n = a + b - 1. He will step down from the b-1 step down to the ground seamlessly. 8. Now, we need to ensure he can descend back to the ground again consistently.

It is easy to see that for these shapes, if we choose the point ( O ) as their center, the areas of the four triangles ( OAB, OBC, OCD, OAD ) are all rational numbers. For example, in the case of a square with area 1, choosing ( O ) as the center, the triangles all have area ( frac{1}{4} ). 2. **Exploring Trapezoids:** Next, we explore trapezoids as they may have a simpler relationship between their side lengths and area. Consider a right-angled trapezoid where the height is 1, and the lengths of the top and bottom bases are ( x ) and ( y ) respectively, with ( y < x ). If we cannot find a trapezoid that meets the requirement, we need to determine what condition must ( x ) and ( y ) satisfy. 3. **Equations for the Trapezoid:** From the area formula of a trapezoid, we get: [ frac{1}{2} cdot (x + y) cdot 1 = 1 Rightarrow x + y = 2. ] 4. **Height Considerations for Triangles ( OAB ) and ( OCD ):** Let the heights from point ( O ) to bases ( AB ) and ( CD ) be ( h_1 ) and ( h_2 ) respectively.

A suitable choice is ( x = sqrt[3]{2} ). 7. **Verification and Conclusion:** It is easy to verify that ( x = sqrt[3]{2} ) is an irrational number and meets the condition for the trapezoids. We can further demonstrate that there are infinitely many other such irrational ( x ) that will also satisfy the required conditions.

Therefore, we can find the length of the train by subtracting the length of the bridge from the total distance: Length of the train = Total distance - Length of the bridge Length of the train ≈ 500 meters - 140 meters Length of the train ≈ 360 meters So, the length of the train is approximately boxed{360} meters."},{"prompt":"Given that f(x5) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}, and f(x) is monotonically increasing when xgeq m, to ensure that f(x) has a unique zero, the value of m can be A: 4 B: 0 C: 5 D: 5","completion":"To solve the problem, we first introduce a function g(x) to represent f(x-5).

Since g(x) is an odd function, we have g(-x) = -g(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. 3. Specifically, for x=0, we find that g(0) = f(0-5) = f(-5) = 0. This means that (-5, 0) is a point on the graph of f(x), and due to the odd nature of g(x), the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (-5, 0). 4. The problem states that f(x) is monotonically increasing when x geq m. For f(x) to have a unique zero, it is necessary that the function does not increase before it reaches its zero. Since we know f(-5) = 0, and the function must be monotonically increasing after its zero for uniqueness, we conclude that m leq -5. 5.
