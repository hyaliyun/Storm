Base Case (( T = 1 )): 1. When ( T = 1 ), we are given that there is only one such ( 1 )-element set, which implies ( X_1 = X_2 = X_3 = ldots ). 2. Clearly, the sequence is periodic with period 1.

Since there are at most ( n+1 ) different ( (n+1) )-element sets, and each of them by the inductive hypothesis contains at most ( n ) different ( n )-element sets, ( X_1, X_2, X_3, ldots ) ends up forming repeating patterns eventually because of the bounded number of ( (n+1) )-element structures. 6. Hence, the sequence must be periodic. This shows that if the statement is true for ( T = n ), it is also true for ( T = n+1 ).

We need to determine the minimum number of colors required to color the points of intersection such that any two points on the same line, between which there are no other intersection points, are colored differently. 2. **Observation about the configuration:** - When we have (3) lines, they form a triangle because they will intersect pairwise in three different points. - Adding more lines maintains complexity, potentially dividing the plane further but also introducing more intersection points. Every new line will intersect all previous lines at new points. 3. **Existence of triangles:** Consider the inductive argument: - With (3) lines, we visually see the formation of a triangle. - Assume for (n) lines, a triangle is formed. - Adding one more line will either: - Intersect all previous (n) lines, maintaining the formation of at least one triangle. - Or, potentially form new shapes like quadrilaterals but not violating the triangle's existence. Hence, triangles always exist. ~~ By induction, triangles always exist ensuring no valid coloring exists with just 2 colors (since a triangle's 3 vertices cannot be colored with just 2 colors ensuring all three vertices are differently colored). ~~ 4. **Showing three colors suffice:** - Use three distinct colors, say (R, G, B) (Red, Green, Blue). - Consider sorting all points of intersection (E) in strictly increasing order of their (x)-coordinates. - Color each point avoiding the colors of its immediate neighbors on the same line; each step: Let (P = d_i cap d_j): - (P) can be influenced at most by two other points: one from (d_i) (left on (d_i)) and one from (d_j) (left on (d_j)). - Since (P) has up to 2 immediate influencing points (maximum) prohibiting their colors, the third color remains available. 5. **Implementation and Verification:** - Initiate with point points in order: 1. Color the first point any of (R, G, B) (start, so no constraint). 2. For each subsequent point (P): Avoid colors of its neighbors (either from (d_i) and (d_j)), and assign the remaining third color. 3.

For f(f(x)) to have exactly 3 distinct real roots, the intermediate step, which involves applying f to x, must produce values that when fed again into f yield three distinct solutions. 2. **Analyzing the Roots of f(x) = 0**: If f(x) = 0 had only one distinct root, then f(f(x)) = 0 could not have 3 distinct real roots because the composition would not expand the number of roots. Therefore, f(x) = 0 must have two distinct roots, say r_1 and r_2. 3. **Considering the Roots of f(f(x)) = 0**: For f(f(x)) = 0 to have three distinct roots, one of the equations f(x) = r_1 or f(x) = r_2 must yield a single distinct root, and the other must yield two distinct roots. Assume without loss of generality that f(x) = r_1 yields a single distinct root. 4. **Determining the Condition for a Single Root**: The equation f(x) = r_1 can be rewritten as x^2 + 6x + c = r_1. For this to have a single distinct root, it must be a perfect square trinomial, which means c - r_1 = 9. Thus, we have r_1 = c - 9. 5. **Solving for c**: Knowing that r_1 is a root of f(x) = 0, we substitute r_1 = c - 9 into the equation to get (c - 9)^2 + 6(c - 9) + c = 0. Simplifying, we find c^2 - 11c + 27 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for c, we get: [ c = frac{11 pm sqrt{(-11)^2 - 4(1)(27)}}{2(1)} = frac{11 pm sqrt{121 - 108}}{2} = frac{11 pm sqrt{13}}{2}. ] 6. **Evaluating Each Value of c**: - If c = frac{11 - sqrt{13}}{2}, then r_1 = c - 9 = -frac{7 + sqrt{13}}{2} and r_2 = -6 - r_1 = frac{-5 + sqrt{13}}{2}.

The sum of the divisors function ( s(x) ) is given by: [ s(x) = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + cdots + 2^a)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + cdots + 3^b)(1 + 5 + 5^2 + cdots + 5^c) cdots ] Each term in the product is a geometric series. 2. **Assumption of Oddness**: Assume that ( s(n-1) ), ( s(n) ), and ( s(n+1) ) are all odd. For ( s(x) ) to be odd, each term in the product must be odd. This implies that the exponents ( a, b, c, ldots ) in the prime factorization of ( x ) must be even, except for the exponent of 2, which must be zero (since ( 1 + 2 + 2^2 + cdots + 2^a ) is odd only if ( a = 0 )). 3. **Contradiction with Perfect Squares**: Since ( n-1 ), ( n ), and ( n+1 ) are consecutive integers, at least one of them must be even. Without loss of generality, assume ( n ) is odd. Then ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are even.

If the percent of tagged fish in the second catch approximates the percent of tagged fish in the pond, what is the approximate number of fish in the pond?","completion":"Let's denote the total number of fish in the pond as N. When 60 fish were caught and tagged, they represented a sample of the entire population of the pond. When 60 fish were caught the second time, 2 of them were tagged, which means that 2 out of 60 fish in this sample were tagged. This ratio (2/60) is assumed to represent the same ratio of tagged fish to the total population in the pond. So, we can set up a proportion: (tagged fish in the second catch / total fish in the second catch) = (total tagged fish / total fish in the pond) 2/60 = 60/N Now, we solve for N: 2N = 60 * 60 2N = 3600 N = 3600 / 2 N = 1800 Therefore, the approximate number of fish in the pond is boxed{1800} ."},{"prompt":"Randolph is some years older than Sydney.

Prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. Composite numbers are numbers that have more than two factors; in other words, they can be divided by numbers other than 1 and themselves. Perfect squares are numbers that are the square of an integer. The numbers that are neither prime, nor composite, nor perfect squares are 1 and 0. However, since we are considering the numbers 1 to 1000, we can exclude 0 from our consideration. 1 is not a prime number because it has only one divisor, which is itself. It is also not a composite number because it does not have more than two factors. Additionally, 1 is a perfect square (1^2 = 1), but since we are looking for numbers that are not perfect squares, we cannot count it.

Therefore, ( n ) must be even. - Given that ( n ) is even, (varphi(n) leq n / 2) and ( tau(n) < 2sqrt{n} ). - Thus, we have: [ n = varphi(n) + 4tau(n) leq frac{n}{2} + 8sqrt{n} ] Rearranging gives: [ frac{n}{2} leq 8sqrt{n} implies n leq 256 ] 3. We then need to test all values of ( n leq 256 ): - **Power of 2**: If ( n = 2^a ), the equation becomes infeasible due to the rapid growth of powers relative to ( tau ). - **Products of Small Primes**: - We need to check values such as: 1.

These smallest chords pass through ( P ) and divide into equal halves at ( P ). 3. **Properties of the Smallest Chords**: It is well-known that the smallest chords passing through a given point in a circle split into two equal halves at that point. Let ( PC = PD ) and ( PE = PF ). 4. **Rectangular Configuration**: We now consider the quadrilateral ( CDEF ). This quadrilateral must be examined to ensure that it forms a rectangle. - Since ( PC = PD ) (both are halves of the chord ( CD )) and ( PE = PF ) (both are halves of the chord ( EF )), we know that ( P ) is the midpoint for both ( CD ) and ( EF ). - The angle angle CPD is perpendicular to angle EPF (angles formed by intersecting two chords). 5. **Perpendicular Chords**: From circle properties and Euclidean geometry, chords ( CD ) and ( EF ) that intersect at any point ( P ) inside the circles will intersect such that: [ angle CPF + angle DPE = 180^circ ] This ensures the angles formed by these intersecting chords are supplementary. 6. **Formation of Rectangle**: Since ( P ) is the midpoint of ( CD ) and ( EF ), and these segments are both perpendicular to each other, the ends of these segments ( C, D, E, ) and ( F ) form right angles at each intersection creating the vertices of a rectangle. Thus, quadrilateral ( CDEF ) must be a rectangle because: [ angle CPE = 90^circ, quad angle EPD = 90^circ, quad angle DPF = 90^circ, quad angle FPC = 90^circ ] # Conclusion: Therefore, the endpoints of the smallest chords ( CD ) and ( EF ) form the vertices of a rectangle, proving the given statement.

Prove that (a_{1} + a_{2} + ldots + a_{n} = b_{1} + b_{2} + ldots).","completion":"1. **Arrange the Sequence in Non-Increasing Order** Consider the sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) where each (a_i) is a natural number. Without loss of generality, let's assume that the sequence is ordered such that (a_1 geq a_2 geq cdots geq a_n). This ordering will help us in visualizing the corresponding Young diagram and understanding the count of numbers that meet specific conditions. 2. **Define the Counts (b_k)** For each value (k), let (b_k) represent the number of elements in the sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) that are greater than or equal to (k). Formally, (b_k) is defined as: [ b_k = left| { a_i mid a_i geq k, 1 leq i leq n } right| ] This means (b_k) counts the terms (a_i) that are at least (k). 3. **Condition from the Problem Statement** According to the problem, we need to prove the equality: [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n = b_1 + b_2 + cdots ] 4. **Visualize Using Young Diagrams** One way to conceptualize this is through Young diagrams (or Ferrers diagrams), which are graphical representations of partitions. If we consider each term (a_i) as the height of a column in a diagram, then the diagram for decreasing sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) represents a tableau where: - Each row corresponds to the number of columns with a height that is at least as large as the row number. - In this arrangement, (b_k) counts the number of columns that extend upwards to at least the level (k). 5. **Connect the Sums** To prove the equality, consider the following observations: - The sum (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n) represents the total number of unit squares in the Young diagram constructed from the sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n). - On the other hand, (b_k) counts the number of columns (or numbers in the sequence) that contribute at least (k) unit squares from the bottom of the Young diagram. Thus, (b_1) counts all columns, (b_2) counts those columns with at least 2 unit squares, and so on. 6. **Group Unit Squares by Rows and Columns** The key insight is to notice that counting by rows (heights of elements (a_i)) and counting by columns ((b_k)) both account for the same unit squares. Specifically: - For each (a_i), the contribution to the total sum (a_i) is exactly the number of unit squares in the (i)-th column. - For (b_k), summing across all (k) essentially counts all the unit squares row by row. Thus, both sums combine to represent the same total quantity of unit squares in the Young diagram. 7. **Conclude the Equality** Hence, we conclude that the sum of the elements in the sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) is equal to the sum of (b_k) over all relevant (k), since both sums encapsulate the total number of unit squares in the same Young diagram: [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n = b_1 + b_2 + cdots ] This completes the proof.

Therefore, sin 2α-tan α = 2sin αcos α-tan α = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}-frac{sqrt{3}}{3}=-frac{sqrt{3}}{6}. (2) First, let's simplify the given function f(x): f(x)=cos (x-α)cos α-sin (x-α)sin α = cos x.

Subtracting the two equations, we get frac{x_2^2 - x_1^2}{a^2} + frac{y_2^2 - y_1^2}{b^2} = 0. This simplifies to: frac{(x_2 - x_1)(x_2 + x_1)}{a^2} + frac{(y_2 - y_1)(y_2 + y_1)}{b^2} = 0. We know that k_1 = frac{y_1 - y_2}{x_1 - x_2} and k_2 = frac{y_1 + y_2}{x_1 + x_2}. So, k_1 k_2 = -frac{b^2}{a^2} = -frac{2}{3}. This implies that b^2 = frac{2}{3}a^2.

Since mathcal{S} contains 10 elements, and each element has 3 choices (to be in A, B, or C), the total number of ways to distribute the elements is 3^{10}. However, this count includes configurations where either A or B (or both) could be empty, which are not allowed by the problem's conditions. To correct for this, we subtract the scenarios where A = emptyset and B+C = mathcal{S}, and similarly for when B = emptyset and A+C = mathcal{S}. Each of these scenarios occurs in 2^{10} ways, since each element of mathcal{S} can either be in the remaining subset or in C. Therefore, we subtract 2cdot2^{10} from our total. However, in doing so, we've subtracted the case where both A and B are empty (A = B = emptyset and C = mathcal{S}) twice, so we need to add it back once. This case only has 1 configuration, so we add 1 back to our total. Thus, the corrected total number of ways to form A and B is 3^{10} - 2cdot2^{10} + 1. Since the problem asks for sets of A and B without regard to order, we divide this number by 2 to account for the fact that each pair (A,B) is counted twice (once as (A,B) and once as (B,A)). Therefore, the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of mathcal{S} is: [ n = frac{1}{2}(3^{10} - 2cdot2^{10} + 1) = 28501 ] To find the remainder when n is divided by 1000, we calculate: [ 28501 equiv 501 pmod{1000} ] Thus, the remainder obtained when n is divided by 1000 is boxed{501}."},{"prompt":"There is a sequence of numbers, denoting the nth number as a_{n}.

Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Visualization using a Circle:** - Imagine placing the sequence ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) around a circle. - The initial configuration ( x_{0}=(1,0,cdots,0,1) ) can be interpreted as placing 1 and 0's around the circumference of a circle at equal intervals. 2. **Symmetry Axis:** - Initially, consider a symmetry axis that passes through points ( x_1 ) and ( x_{n} ). Due to the symmetry of the configuration, this is an axis of symmetry at start. 3. **Transformation via Update Rule:** - For each ( k geq 1 ), the configuration ( { x_i^{(k)} } ) is determined by the defined update rule, resulting from applying modulo ( 2 ) addition around the circle. 4. **Behavior of Symmetry Axis:** - After each transformation, the axis of symmetry through the initial ( 1 ) and ( 0 ) shifts. Specifically, the axis rotates by an angle of ( frac{pi}{n} ) in the counter-clockwise direction. 5. **Full circle completion:** - To return to the original configuration ( x_0 ), the axis must complete one full rotation.

Problem (1): We need to find all positive integers n for which there exist integers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n such that both a_i and a_i + i (for all 1 leq i leq n) form a complete residue system modulo n. 1. **Step 1:** Note that a complete residue system modulo n is a set {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n} where each a_i represents a distinct residue mod n. Given that a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n is a complete residue system modulo n, each a_i must be distinct modulo n. 2. **Step 2:** Consider the set {a_i + i mid 1 leq i leq n}. This set must also form a complete residue system modulo n. Thus, for all i and j such that 1 leq i < j leq n, the differences (a_i + i) - (a_j + j) must be distinct modulo n. 3. **Step 3:** Simplifying the expression (a_i + i) - (a_j + j), we have: (a_i + i) - (a_j + j) equiv (a_i - a_j) + (i - j) pmod{n}. Since a_i and a_j are distinct modulo n, and i and j are also distinct, every difference (a_i + i) - (a_j + j) must be non-zero modulo n for all 1 leq i < j leq n. 4. **Conclusion:** Thus, a_i + i needs to be different from a_j + j for all i neq j, ensuring that all values are distinct mod n. This means n must divide (a_i + i). The simplest case satisfying this is where each i value itself is a distinct residue mod n. Therefore, n can be any positive integer. Therefore, n must be such that both sets {a_i} and {a_i + i} form residue classes modulo n. Problem (2): For the second case, we need to find all positive integers n for which there exist integers a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n such that the sets {a_i}, {a_i + i}, and {a_i - i} (for all 1 leq i leq n) all form complete residue systems modulo n. 1. **Step 1:** Again, we note that for {a_i, a_i + i, a_i - i} to form complete residue systems modulo n, each a_i must be distinct and represent different residues modulo n. 2. **Step 2:** Consider the set {a_i - i mid 1 leq i leq n}. This set also needs to form a complete residue system modulo n. 3. **Step 3:** For any i and j such that 1 leq i < j leq n, the differences (a_i + i) - (a_j + j) and (a_i - i) - (a_j - j) must be distinct modulo n. Since the expressions (a_i + i) - (a_j + j) and (a_i - i) - (a_j - j) are simply a_i - a_j + (i - j) and a_i - a_j - (i - j), respectively, and given that a_i, a_j, i, and j are distinct modulo n, we must have all differences be distinct modulo n for all 1 leq i < j leq n. 4. **Conclusion:** Thus, similar reasoning follows that requires n to ensure that sets {a_i, a_i + i, a_i - i} form complete residue classes modulo n, indicating certain constraints on n. Specifically, n should be of a form ensuring distinct differences modulo n and compatible with these residue requirements.

Here is the detailed step-by-step proof: 1. **Consider (k, 2k, 3k, ldots):** - Since (k in M), consider multiples of (k) such as (k, 2k, 3k, ldots). - By condition (2), (k, 2k, 3k, ldots) must all be the same color as (k). 2. **Bounding Multiples:** - For ((a+1)k geq n), use condition (1) that says (k) and (n-k ) are the same color.

Let's denote R as the radius of the circle, hence: - OA = OB = R - OC = OD = R 4. **Use the power of a point theorem:** The power of a point theorem states that for any point X on CD, the following relationship holds: [ OA^2 - OX^2 = AX cdot XE ] But O is the midpoint, and OX is perpendicular from X to AB.

Let (A) be a red point, and construct an equilateral triangle (ABC) with side length 1. 4. By the hypothesis, points (B) and (C) must be colored differently from (A), so assume without loss of generality that (B) is blue and (C) is green. 5. Construct the reflection (A') of point (A) over the line (BC). 6. The point (A') is at a distance (sqrt{3}) from point (A) and will necessarily be red (since it is symmetrically opposite to (A)). 7. Similarly, if we construct all such symmetric points about triangles with vertices colored by three distinct colors starting from (A), we get that all points on the circle centered at (A) with radius (sqrt{3}) must be red. 8. This leads to a contradiction because it implies that on this circle, there must be points that are at a distance of 1 from each other, which would mean there are red points separated by a distance of 1. Hence, it is impossible to color the plane with three colors such that no two points at a distance of 1 share the same color.

The base-6 system means each digit represents powers of 6, from rightmost (units) to leftmost. 2. **Analyze the changes between the codes**: - From ABC to ABD, the last digit changes, so C+1 = D. Therefore, if C is the largest digit before rolling over (i.e., 5), then D = 0. - From ABD to AEF, the second digit changes, indicating B rolls over. If B = 5 and C = 5, then D = 0 and B+1 causes an increment in A.

The formula for the circumference of a full circle is ( C = 2pi r ), where ( r ) is the radius of the circle. Since we are dealing with semi-circles, we will use half of this circumference plus the diameter for each semi-circle to get the perimeter. For the large semi-circle with a radius of 6.6 cm: The circumference of the full circle would be ( C_{large} = 2pi(6.6) ). The perimeter of the semi-circle would be half of this plus the diameter, so: ( P_{large} = pi(6.6) + 2(6.6) ). For each of the smaller semi-circles with a radius of 3.3 cm: The circumference of the full circle would be ( C_{small} = 2pi(3.3) ).

From the first garden, we know that 10% of the 20 plants are tomato plants. So, the number of tomato plants in the first garden is: ( 0.10 times 20 = 2 ) tomato plants. In the second garden, ( frac{1}{3} ) of the plants are tomato plants. So, the number of tomato plants in the second garden is: ( frac{1}{3} times P ).

According to the problem, the sum of the tomato plants from both gardens should be equal to 20% of the total number of plants in both gardens. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: ( 2 + frac{1}{3}P = 0.20 times (20 + P) ). Now, let's solve for ( P ): ( 2 + frac{1}{3}P = 0.20 times 20 + 0.20P ), ( 2 + frac{1}{3}P = 4 + 0.20P ).

A: frac{1}{15} B: frac{2}{5} C: frac{7}{15} D: frac{8}{15}","completion":"To solve this problem, we first understand that xi = 3 implies that after taking out two balls and putting them back, there are three old balls in the box, which is impossible given the initial conditions. Therefore, the interpretation of xi = 3 meaning one new ball and one old ball are taken out is incorrect. Instead, the problem seems to be asking for the probability of a certain event related to taking balls out, but the condition xi = 3 cannot occur based on the initial setup. However, following the provided solution's logic and correcting the interpretation mistake: The correct scenario to consider is the probability of picking one new ball and one old ball when two balls are taken out. This can be calculated using combinations. The total number of ways to pick any two balls out of six is given by the combination formula C_6^2. This calculates the number of ways to choose 2 items out of 6 without regard to order, which is: [C_6^2 = frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1} = 15] The number of ways to pick one new ball and one old ball is the product of choosing 1 out of 4 new balls and 1 out of 2 old balls, which is C_4^1 times C_2^1. This calculates as: [C_4^1 = frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} = 4] [C_2^1 = frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = 2] Multiplying these together gives the number of favorable outcomes: [C_4^1C_2^1 = 4 times 2 = 8] Therefore, the probability P(xi = 3), under the corrected understanding that it refers to the probability of choosing one new and one old ball, is calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes: [P(xi = 3) = frac{C_4^1C_2^1}{C_6^2} = frac{8}{15}] Thus, the correct answer, following the rules and the corrected interpretation, is: [boxed{D}]"},{"prompt":"Given that the line 2x+y=0 is an asymptote of the hyperbola frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 where a > 0 and b > 0, find the eccentricity of this hyperbola.

The equation of the asymptotes of a hyperbola frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} - frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 is given by y = pm frac{b}{a}x. By comparing this to the given line 2x + y = 0, which can be rewritten as y = -2x, we match the coefficients on x to find that -frac{b}{a} = -2. Therefore, we conclude that b = 2a. Now we have b^2 = (2a)^2 = 4a^2. Next, we use the relationship between a, b, and the hyperbola's focal length c which is given by c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Plugging b^2 = 4a^2 into this equation, we get c^2 = a^2 + 4a^2 = 5a^2. The eccentricity e of the hyperbola is defined as e = frac{c}{a}, and since it must be greater than 1 for a hyperbola (as opposed to an ellipse where it is less than 1), we find that e = frac{sqrt{5a^2}}{a} = sqrt{5}.

Solution: (1) Since the function g(x) = f(x) + x (x in mathbb{R}) is an odd function, therefore g(-x) = -g(x), which means f(-x) - x = -f(x) - x, thus f(-x) = -f(x).

For which n, alternating horizontal and vertical moves, can it visit all the squares of the board in n^{2} moves and return to its original position? (Only the squares where the rook stops are counted, not the ones it passes over during the move.)","completion":"1. The problem is presented as follows: A rook starts in the corner of an n times n chessboard. The task is to determine for which values of n the rook can travel across all squares of the board and return to its starting point within n^2 moves, alternating between horizontal and vertical moves. Each move the rook can stop on a square, but cannot merely pass over it. 2. First, let us consider the rook's path for an even n. The rook can follow a zigzag pattern, ensuring that it stops on each square of the first two rows, then moves to the next rows in a similar pattern. Each move alternates horizontally and vertically. For example, with n = 4, the rook's path can be visualized as: [ 1 rightarrow 2 rightarrow 3 rightarrow 4 downarrow 8 leftarrow 7 leftarrow 6 leftarrow 5 downarrow 9 rightarrow 10 rightarrow 11 rightarrow 12 downarrow 16 leftarrow 15 leftarrow 14 leftarrow 13 rightarrow (return to 1) ] Here, the rook visits each square exactly once, alternating between horizontal and vertical moves. 3. Now let's prove that it is not possible to achieve this for an odd n. Consider any horizontal row other than the first one. For the rook to visit each square in an exact number of n^2 moves: a. Suppose the rook lands on a square in a specific row; for an odd n, there will always be an odd number of moves required to return to an adjacent row. b. In an odd n, each row and column grid square must be part of a pair for the rook to visit and return in an equal number of moves. Given the chessboard's symmetry, this implies that each row must be paired equally with another row, something that is impossible for an odd n. For instance, with n = 3, consider the positions: [ a_{11} rightarrow a_{12} rightarrow a_{13} downarrow a_{23} leftarrow a_{22} leftarrow a_{21} downarrow a_{31} rightarrow a_{32} rightarrow (missing a_{33}) ] In this sequence, the rook will miss one position or return prematurely, making it impossible to evenly distribute the moves within n^2. # Conclusion: Hence, the rook can visit each square and return to the original square in exactly n^2 moves only for even values of n.

Consider the circle touching the extensions of sides AB and AD of the square. Let the radius of the circle be R and the center of the circle be O. The radius drawn to the points of tangency creates right angles with these extensions. 3.

If we had the individual tolling frequency for each bell, we could find the least common multiple (LCM) of those frequencies to determine the interval at which they all toll together, and then confirm that it matches the boxed{2-minute} interval we've calculated."},{"prompt":"f mathscr{U} is an upper family of an nelement set X and mathscr{T} is a lower family of X, then |mathscr{U}| cdot|mathscr{D}| geq 2^{n}|mathscr{U} cap mathscr{D}| .","completion":"To prove the inequality [|mathscr{U}| cdot |mathscr{D}| geq 2^{n} |mathscr{U} cap mathscr{D}|] we utilize mathematical induction. 1. **Base case: (n=1)** - When (n=1), the set (X) has only one element.

We need to find the length of the other diagonal (d2) to use the formula for the area. Let's rearrange the formula to solve for d2: d2 = (Area * 2) / d1 Now, we can plug in the values we have: d2 = (327.90242451070714 m² * 2) / 16 m d2 = 655.80484902141428 m² / 16 m d2 = 40.98780243821339 m Now that we have the length of the second diagonal, we can use the properties of a rhombus to find the length of the side. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. This means that each half of a diagonal forms a right-angled triangle with the side of the rhombus and half of the other diagonal. Using the Pythagorean theorem for one of these right-angled triangles, we have: (side/2)² + (d1/2)² = (d2/2)² Let's denote the length of the side as 's'. Then we have: (s/2)² + (16/2)² = (40.98780243821339/2)² (s/2)² + 8² = 20.493901219106695² (s/2)² + 64 = 419.99999999999994 (s/2)² = 419.99999999999994 - 64 (s/2)² = 355.99999999999994 s/2 = √355.99999999999994 s/2 ≈ 18.867962264113206 s ≈ 37.73592452822641 m Therefore, the length of the side of the rhombus is approximately boxed{37.73592452822641} meters."},{"prompt":"f 20% of M is 60% of 1230, what is the value of M?","completion":"The problem statement can be formulated as: [ frac{20}{100}M = frac{60}{100} times 1230 ] Simplifying both sides: [ 0.2M = 0.6 times 1230 ] Further calculation: [ 0.2M = 738 ] Isolating M: [ M = frac{738}{0.2} = 3690 ] Thus, the value of M is boxed{3690}."},{"prompt":"f ( p ) is a prime, show that ( 2^p + 3^p ) cannot be an ( n )th power (for ( n > 1 )).","completion":"To prove that ( 2^p + 3^p ) cannot be an ( n )-th power for ( n > 1 ) and ( p ) prime, we will proceed in the following steps: 1. **Modular Analysis for ( p ne 5 )**: Consider the expression ( 2^p + 3^p ). Notice that both ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are congruent modulo ( 5 ).

Let's find v^(1/2) in terms of z: v^(1/2) = (0.491606z^4)^(1/2) v^(1/2) = 0.70115z^2 Now, we can compare v^(1/2) to u: v^(1/2) / u = 0.70115z^2 / 1.20z^2 v^(1/2) / u = 0.70115 / 1.20 v^(1/2) / u ≈ 0.58429 To find v as a percentage of u, we need to square the ratio we just found (since we took the square root of v earlier): (v / u) = (v^(1/2) / u)^2 (v / u) = (0.58429)^2 (v / u) ≈ 0.3414 To express this as a percentage: (v / u) ≈ 34.14% Therefore, v is approximately boxed{34.14} percent of u."},{"prompt":"An athlete sees a number in the mirror that is the same as the number on the sports jersey he is wearing.

Consider one face of the cube. Since the side length of the cube is 4, each face of the cube is a square with an area of (4 times 4 = 16) square units. 2. The sphere has a radius of 1 unit. When the sphere touches a face of the cube, it can only touch the central part of the face. The central part of the face that the sphere can touch has a side length of (4 - 2 times 1 = 2) units, because the sphere is tangent to the face at a distance equal to its own radius from each side. 3. Thus, the area that the sphere can touch on one face is a square with a side length of 2 units. The area of this square is (2 times 2 = 4) square units. 4. Therefore, the area that the sphere cannot touch on one face is the remaining part of the face, which is the total area of the face minus the central square. This is (16 - 4 = 12) square units. 5. The cube has 6 faces, and this calculation applies to each face equally.

For any vertex ( x ) in ( G ), the graph ( G - x ) (the graph obtained by removing ( x ) and its incident edges) has a perfect matching. We need to prove that every vertex in ( G ) lies on some odd cycle. 2. **Definitions and Notations:** - A **perfect matching** in a graph is a matching that covers all vertices of the graph. - An **odd cycle** is a cycle with an odd number of edges. 3. **Initial Setup:** Let ( x ) be a vertex in ( G ). Let ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_t ) be the neighbors of ( x ). When ( x ) is removed, the remaining graph ( G - x ) has a perfect matching. Let ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_t ) be the vertices matched with ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_t ) respectively in this perfect matching. 4. **Perfect Matching in ( G - x ):** Since ( G - x ) has a perfect matching, and there are ( 2n ) vertices in ( G - x ), we have ( t = n ) (since each vertex ( x_i ) is matched with a unique ( v_i )). 5. **Constructing the Odd Cycle:** - Remove ( x_1 ) from ( G - x ).

This sequence of edges forms an alternating path between the old and new matchings. - Since we started and ended with edges from the new matching, the total number of edges used is odd. 7. **Conclusion:** - The edges used in this alternating path, together with the edges ( xx_1, x_1v_1, xx_2, x_2v_2 ), form an odd cycle. - This odd cycle includes the vertex ( x ).

Each side and diagonal of the n-gon is colored either red or blue. We can choose a vertex and change the color of all segments emanating from that vertex. We need to prove that it is always possible to achieve a configuration where the number of blue segments at each vertex is even, and that the resulting coloring depends only on the initial coloring. 2. **Define the operation:** Let a_i be the number of blue edges incident to vertex i. The operation of choosing a vertex j and changing the color of all segments emanating from that vertex can be described as: [ (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_j, ldots, a_n) rightarrow (a_1 + 1, a_2 + 1, ldots, a_j + 1, ldots, a_n + 1) pmod{2} ] This means that the parity (even or odd) of the number of blue edges at each vertex changes. 3. **Case when n is odd:** When n is odd, the operation changes the parity of the number of blue edges at each vertex except for the chosen vertex j. This can be written as: [ (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_j, ldots, a_n) rightarrow (a_1 + 1, a_2 + 1, ldots, a_j, ldots, a_n + 1) pmod{2} ] Here, a_j remains constant modulo 2. 4. **Algorithm to achieve the desired configuration:** We aim to achieve a configuration where the number of blue edges at each vertex is even, i.e., (0, 0, ldots, 0). We can do this by increasing the number of zeros step by step. Suppose we have a configuration (c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n) with k zeros and n-k ones. If k = n, we are done. Otherwise, we choose a vertex with a one (say c_1 = 1) and perform the operation: [ (1, c_2, ldots, c_n) rightarrow (1, c_2 + 1, ldots, c_n + 1) pmod{2} ] This increases the number of zeros by one. If k + 1 = n - 1, we choose a zero and perform the operation to finish. Otherwise, we continue choosing vertices with ones and performing the operation until all vertices have an even number of blue edges. 5. **Conclusion:** By repeatedly applying the operation, we can always achieve a configuration where the number of blue edges at each vertex is even. The resulting coloring depends only on the initial coloring because the operation is deterministic and the process terminates in a finite number of steps.

Prove that there are two points of the same color such that the distance between them is 1.","completion":"To prove that any plane colored in two colors always contains two points of the same color exactly 1 unit distance apart, let's proceed with the following steps: 1. **Construct an equilateral triangle**: Consider an equilateral triangle ( triangle ABC ) with side length 1. This triangle is chosen because it will allow us to illustrate the pigeonhole principle in a simple two-color scenario. 2. **Label the vertices**: Let the vertices of this equilateral triangle be ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ). Since the side length of the triangle is 1, the distances ( AB ), ( BC ), and ( CA ) are all equal to 1. 3. **Application of the pigeonhole principle**: Since the plane is colored in only two colors, each vertex of the triangle ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) must be colored in either one of the two colors, say red or blue. 4. **Analyze all coloring cases**: - Case 1: All three vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) are of the same color. In this case, any two points among these vertices have the same color, and the distance between them is 1. - Case 2: Two vertices (let’s say ( A ) and ( B )) are of one color, and the third vertex (( C )) is of the other color. Here, the vertices ( A ) and ( B ) are both colored the same, and since ( AB = 1), the requirement is satisfied. 5. **Conclusion**: It is impossible to color an equilateral triangle's vertices such that all three are different colors because the triangle only has two colors available. Thus, there must always be at least two vertices of the same color. These two vertices are exactly 1 unit apart.

The first four terms are given as ( 1, 9, 8, 2 ). 2. **Generating the Sequence**: Let's generate the next few terms to understand the pattern: [ begin{align*} S_5 &= (1 + 9 + 8 + 2) mod 10 = 20 mod 10 = 0, S_6 &= (9 + 8 + 2 + 0) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9, S_7 &= (8 + 2 + 0 + 9) mod 10 = 19 mod 10 = 9, S_8 &= (2 + 0 + 9 + 9) mod 10 = 20 mod 10 = 0, S_9 &= (0 + 9 + 9 + 0) mod 10 = 18 mod 10 = 8, S_{10} &= (9 + 9 + 0 + 8) mod 10 = 26 mod 10 = 6, S_{11} &= (9 + 0 + 8 + 6) mod 10 = 23 mod 10 = 3, S_{12} &= (0 + 8 + 6 + 3) mod 10 = 17 mod 10 = 7, S_{13} &= (8 + 6 + 3 + 7) mod 10 = 24 mod 10 = 4, end{align*} and so on. 3. **Checking for Repetition**: Since there are only ( 10^4 = 10000 ) possible combinations of four consecutive digits, the sequence must eventually repeat. This is due to the Pigeonhole Principle, which states that if more items are put into fewer containers than there are items, at least one container must contain more than one item. 4. **Finding the Specific Sequence**: We need to check if the sequence ( 3, 0, 4, 4 ) appears.

Step 2: Characteristics of Polynomial ( P ) Let's analyze the increment behavior of ( P(n) ): For ( n ) in the interval between ( k^2 ) and ( k^2 + 2k ), we know: [ lfloor sqrt{n} rfloor = k ] Thus, [ P(n) - P(n-1) = k ] Step 3: Polynomial Transformation Define a new polynomial: [ Q(X) = P(X) - P(X-1) - k ] Since degree of ( Q(X) ) is at most ( d ), the polynomial ( Q(X) ) should be zero for all ( X ) in the interval ( [k^2, k^2 + 2k] ). This interval contains ( 2k+1 ) integers. Step 4: Contradiction Argument A non-zero polynomial of degree ( d ) cannot have ( 2k+1 ) roots, where ( k geq d ), as the number of roots would exceed the degree of the polynomial. Therefore, ( Q(X) ) must be the zero polynomial: [ P(X) - P(X-1) - k = 0 implies P(X) = kX + C ] This relationship must hold for all ( k geq d ), which contradicts the assumption that ( P ) could be any non-zero polynomial. Therefore, the initial assumption that such a polynomial ( P ) exists is incorrect. Alternative Solution (Degree Analysis): Suppose again such a polynomial ( P ) exists and has degree ( d ). Step 1: Degree Bound For every integer ( n ), it holds: [ 0 leq P(n) leq n sqrt{n} ] Thus, [ P(n) text{ grows no faster than } n^{3/2} ] so the degree of polynomial ( P ) must satisfy: [ d leq 1 ] Step 2: Examine Linear Case Assume ( P(X) = aX + b ). [ P(0) = b Rightarrow b = 0 ] [ P(1) = a Rightarrow a = 1 ] Thus, [ P(X) = X ] However, this leads to an inconsistency: [ sum_{i=1}^{4} lfloor sqrt{i} rfloor = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 ] whereas ( P(4) = 4 ). Hence, we see that: [ P(4) neq sum_{i=1}^{4} lfloor sqrt{i} rfloor = 5 ] which is a contradiction. Conclusion: Thus, no polynomial ( P ) can equal the sum of floor values of square roots as specified.

The set A is clearly defined as A = {1,2,3}. The set B, however, is defined by an inequality involving x, so we must find the integer solutions that satisfy (x+1)(x-2) < 0. Here's how we proceed: 1. Solve the inequality (x+1)(x-2) < 0. To do this, we recognize that the inequality holds true when x is between the roots of the quadratic equation (x+1)(x-2) = 0. The roots are x = -1 and x = 2. 2. The inequality (x+1)(x-2) < 0 means the product of the two expressions is negative; this occurs when x is between the roots, excluding the roots themselves since the inequality is strict (< 0 and not ≤ 0). 3. Thus, the solution to the inequality would be all real numbers x such that -1 < x < 2. However, since x in mathbb{Z}, we are only interested in integer solutions. The integer numbers that satisfy this condition are 0 and 1. 4. Therefore, set B = {0,1}. 5.

This shows that the circle has a center at (2,-4) and a radius r = sqrt{20} = 2sqrt{5}. 3. **Calculate the distance from the center of the circle to line l:** The distance d from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by d=dfrac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Substituting the center of the circle (2, -4) and the equation of line l (x + 2y + 1 = 0), we find d = dfrac{|2 + 2(-4) + 1|}{sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} = dfrac{|2 - 8 + 1|}{sqrt{5}} = dfrac{|-5|}{sqrt{5}} = sqrt{5}. 4. **Find the chord length AB:** The chord length can be found using the formula AB=2sqrt{r^{2}-d^{2}}, where r is the radius of the circle and d is the distance from the center of the circle to the line. Substituting r=2sqrt{5} and d=sqrt{5}, we get AB=2sqrt{(2sqrt{5})^{2}-(sqrt{5})^{2}} = 2sqrt{20-5} = 2sqrt{15}.

We need to arrange 100 arcs such that each arc intersects exactly ( k ) others. This implies certain restrictions on ( k ) based on combinatorial properties and divisibility rules. 2. **Reformulate the Problem:** Consider each arc as a vertex in a graph, and an intersection between two arcs as an edge between the corresponding vertices. We must ensure each vertex (arc) has a degree of ( k ). 3. **Analyze Intersection Requirements:** If each of the 100 arcs intersects exactly ( k ) other arcs, then the graph's degree sequence is regular with each vertex having degree ( k ). 4. **Account for Number of Intersections:** The total number of intersections for all the arcs combined is (frac{100k}{2}) (since each intersection is counted twice, once for each arc that intersects). This value must be an integer and must make sense within the context of the problem. 5. **Check Modular Arithmetic:** Since we need to avoid cases where segments cannot properly form intersections, we should also consider ( k ) modulo the number of arcs. For this problem, it implies a restriction based on divisibility. 6. **Divisibility Constraints:** An important constraint is that ( k + 1 ) should not be divisible by 8. This stems from geometric and combinatorial properties specific to divisibility when constructing such intersections. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the valid values of ( k ) will be all integers less than 100 which satisfy the condition that ( k + 1 ) is not divisible by 8.

First, we rewrite the given equation in terms of the sides of the triangle: b^2 + c^2 = a^2 + bc. Then, applying the Law of Cosines for angle A, we get: cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} = frac{bc}{2bc} = frac{1}{2}. Given that A is in the interval (0, pi), which corresponds to an acute angle, we find: A = frac{pi}{3}. Thus, we have: A = boxed{frac{pi}{3}}.

Can this process continue indefinitely?","completion":"Given the problem about repeatedly shortening the longest stick Fedya has, we are to determine whether this process can continue indefinitely. Let's explore this step-by-step: 1. **Polynomial Root Assumption:** We start by considering a polynomial ( P(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 ). We are given that there exists a root ( t > 1 ). To verify this, we can check the values of ( P(x) ) at specific points: [ P(1) = 1^3 - 1^2 - 1 - 1 = 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 = -2 < 0 ] [ P(2) = 2^3 - 2^2 - 2 - 1 = 8 - 4 - 2 - 1 = 1 > 0 ] By the intermediate value theorem, there exists some ( t ) in the interval ( (1, 2) ) such that ( P(t) = 0 ). 2. **Establishing the Relationship:** Given ( P(t) = 0 ), logically: [ t^3 = t^2 + t + 1 ] Since ( t > 1 ), it is clear that: [ t^3 = t^2 + t + 1 > t^2 + t ] We use this to establish the lengths of the sticks as follows: [ t^3, ; t^2, ; t ] 3. **First Trimming Process:** In the first iteration, Fedya shortens the longest stick ( t^3 ) to the sum of the lengths of the other two sticks, i.e., [ t^3 rightarrow t^2 + t ] Now the lengths of the sticks become ( t^2, ; t, ; t^2 + t ). 4. **Subsequent Steps:** Because the relationship ( t^3 = t^2 + t + 1 ) holds and does not change the ratio between the lengths after one iteration as the longer dimension still can be regrouped to be ( t ) times prior results (if followed), we observe: [ t^3 rightarrow t^{2}, ; t, ; 1 ] The ratio ( frac{t^3}{t^2} = t ), ensures each time trimming, the maximum or major length in the system can still balance the others and fits into equivalency form. 5. **Conclusion:** Since shortening the longest stick based on the provided polynomial root relationship ( t ) does not change the proportional form, the process described here can continue infinitely without reducing any stick length to zero.

Therefore, (a) and (b) must satisfy: [ -4 < a < 4 quad text{and} quad -4 < b < 4 ] Since (a) and (b) are integers, the possible values for (a) and (b) are (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3). 2. **Second Inequality: (a^2 + b^2 < 8a)** Rearrange this inequality: [ a^2 - 8a + b^2 < 0 implies (a-4)^2 + b^2 < 16 ] This represents the interior of a circle centered at ((4, 0)) with radius 4.

The derivative is given by: [f'(x) = 2x^{2} - x + a - 1.] The slope of the tangent line at (1, f(1)) is f'(1).

Thus, any out-of-place number in these positions would stay incorrect. 3. **Sufficient Condition Depth:** - Assume that after each (i)-th round, the numbers (1, cdots, i) are in the correct positions. We can consider \\"adding\\" additional fixes that could have been made during the (i)-th round (involving the first (i-1) pairs). Since (1, cdots, i) are correctly ordered by assumption, these fixes would not alter the configuration. - Therefore, this modified sorting process becomes identical to the Bubble Sort algorithm, which guarantees that the array will be fully sorted. 4. **Permutation Count Analysis:** - **Positions for (1):** The number (1) can be in either position (p_1) or (p_2), giving us two choices. - **Positions for (2):** The number (2) can be in any of ((p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4)) except the position occupied by (1). Thus, there are (3) choices for the position of (2). - **General Case for (i):** Similarly, for (1 leq i leq 1009), there are (i+1) possible positions. For instance: - Possible places for (i = 1009) are ({p_1, p_2, ..., p_{1010}}), giving (1010) positions. 5. **Counting Valid Permutations:** - The permutations of (1) through (1009) must fit into (1009+1=1010) positions and the remaining (1009) elements are unordered and can fill the remaining positions without restrictions. - Hence, the total number of permutations leading to a correctly ordered sequence is given by: 1009! times 1010! # Conclusion: Therefore, the number of permutations of ( {1, ldots, 2018} ) that, after performing the described sorting process, result in ( {1, ldots, 2018} ), is: [ boxed{1009! cdot 1010!} ]"},{"prompt":"There are 2 baskets of peaches.

If we subtract the total number of red peaches from the total number of peaches, we will get the total number of green peaches in both baskets. Total green peaches = Total peaches - Total red peaches Total green peaches = 12 - 8 Total green peaches = 4 Since the number of green peaches is the same in each basket, we divide the total number of green peaches by the number of baskets to find the number of green peaches in each basket. Number of green peaches in each basket = Total green peaches / Number of baskets Number of green peaches in each basket = 4 / 2 Number of green peaches in each basket = 2 So, there are boxed{2} green peaches in each basket."},{"prompt":"eema took a loan of rs 1500 with simple interest for as many years as the rate of interest . if she paid rs . 735 as interest at the end of the loan period , what was the rate of interest .","completion":"Let's denote the rate of interest as R% per annum, and the time period for which the loan was taken as T years.

Therefore, we only consider the exterior sides without multiple counting. First, compute the sum of perimeters for all 20 rectangles: [ sum_{i=1}^{20} 2 times (i + (i + 1)) ] This simplifies to: [ sum_{i=1}^{20} 2(2i + 1) = 2 times ( sum_{i=1}^{20} (2i + 1) ) ] Next, compute the sum inside the series: [ sum_{i=1}^{20} 2i + sum_{i=1}^{20} 1 ] 1. The first sum: [ 2 times sum_{i=1}^{20} i = 2 times frac{20 times (20 + 1)}{2} = 20 times 21 = 420 ] 2.

We are given the condition that among the values taken by ( P(x) ) for natural ( x ), all numbers of the form ( 2^m ) with natural ( m ) should appear. 2. Consider the specific case ( P(x) = (x + m)^n ) for some natural number ( m ). Clearly, this polynomial does not take all forms ( 2^m ) for natural ( m ). For instance, it does not take the value 2 because ( (x + m)^n ) cannot equal 2 for any natural ( x ), as ( (x + m) geq m+1 ). 3. For other polynomials, we need to show the existence of some integer ( m ) such that for sufficiently large ( x ), [ (x + m)^n < P(x) < (x + m + 1)^n quad (*) ] 4. Assume ( (*) ) holds. Then, there exists some ( x_0 ) such that for all ( x geq x_0 ), ( P(x) ) is strictly increasing. Let ( M ) be the maximum value of ( P(x) ) on the interval ([1, x_0]). 5.

For this choice of ( k ), [ P(2^k - m - 1) < 2^{kn} < P(2^k - m) ] This shows ( P(x) ) does not take the values ( 2^{kn} ) for natural ( x ). 6. To complete our proof, let's establish ( (*) ). Consider the polynomial [ P(x) = x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + cdots + a_0 ] where the leading coefficient (coefficient of ( x^n )) is 1. We compare this to ( (x + m)^n ) expanded as [ (x + m)^n = x^n + n m x^{n-1} + cdots + m^n ] If the leading coefficient (( n m )) of ( x^{n-1} ) term does not match ( a_{n-1} ) in ( P(x) ), then we must have ( m = leftlfloor frac{a_{n-1}}{n} rightrfloor ). 7. Now, consider the polynomial ( Q(x) = P(x) - (x + m)^n ). This ( Q(x) neq 0 ) and has a degree less than ( n - 1 ). 8. If the leading coefficient of ( Q(x) ) is positive, then we set ( m ) such that ( a_{n-1} = n k ). However, if the leading coefficient is negative, we adjust ( m ) to set ( m = k - 1 ). Conclusion: Therefore, our proof shows the above condition can only be met if ( P(x) ) is of the first degree, i.e. [ P(x) = x + c ] Hence, the polynomial ( P(x) ) must be a first-degree polynomial.

The inclination angle of a line is the angle that the line makes with the positive direction of the x-axis.

However, the line given by the equation x=3 is a special case. It is a vertical line and does not have a defined slope because it does not rise or run in the usual sense; it runs infinitely vertically without any horizontal change. Without a defined slope, we cannot use the usual tan-inverse to find the inclination angle.

Calculate the ratio of the areas of triangle QAB and triangle PDE.","completion":"(1) The vectors overrightarrow{MA} and overrightarrow{MB} can be expressed as overrightarrow{MA}=(-2-x,1-y) and overrightarrow{MB}=(2-x,1-y), respectively. Therefore, the sum overrightarrow{MA} + overrightarrow{MB}=(-2x,2-2y), and the magnitude of this sum is: |overrightarrow{MA}+ overrightarrow{MB}|= sqrt{(-2x)^2+(2-2y)^2}. Now, the dot product overrightarrow{OM} cdot (overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{OB}) + 2 is calculated as: overrightarrow{OM} cdot (overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{OB}) + 2 = (x,y) cdot (0,2) + 2 = 2y + 2. By equating the expressions from the given condition, we have: sqrt{(-2x)^2+(2-2y)^2} = 2y + 2. Simplifying yields the equation of curve C: x^2 = 4y. Therefore, the equation of curve C is boxed{x^2 = 4y}. (2) The equations of lines PA and PB are y = -x - 1 and y = x - 1 respectively, and y_0 = frac{1}{2}x_0 for points on curve C. The slope of the tangent line l at the point Q(x_0,y_0) is k = frac{1}{2}x_0, and thus the equation of the tangent line at Q is: y = tfrac{1}{2}x_0x - tfrac{1}{4}x_0^2. The intersection with the y-axis is point F(0,-tfrac{1}{4}x_0^2). Solving the system of equations [ begin{cases} y = -x - 1 y = tfrac{1}{2}x_0x - tfrac{1}{4}x_0^2 end{cases} ] gives us x_D = tfrac{x_0 - 2}{2}, and solving [ begin{cases} y = x - 1 y = tfrac{1}{2}x_0x - tfrac{1}{4}x_0^2 end{cases} ] gives us x_E = tfrac{x_0 + 2}{2}. Therefore, x_E - x_D = 2, and |FP| = 1 - tfrac{x_0^2}{4}.

This means (|N(p)| geq 4) for every ( p in S). 4. **Degree Argument:** - In graph theoretical terms, consider a graph ( G ) where each vertex represents a point in ( S ) and an edge exists between two vertices if and only if they are mutual nearest neighbors. - The assumption would imply that each vertex in ( G ) has a degree (number of neighboring vertices) of at least 4. 5. **Planar Graph Constraint:** - According to planar graph properties, Euler's formula for a connected planar graph states: ( V - E + F = 2 ), where ( V ) is the number of vertices, ( E ) is the number of edges, and ( F ) is the number of faces. - For a planar graph with ( V ) vertices, a common inequality derived from Euler's formula is ( E leq 3V - 6 ). 6. **Edge Counting:** - If each vertex has at least 4 neighbors, then the total degree count is (sum text{degree}(v) geq 4V), where ( text{degree}(v) ) is the degree of vertex ( v ).

Calculate the first derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(ln x - frac{m}{x}) = frac{1}{x} + frac{m}{x^2}. Setting f'(x) = 0 gives us: frac{1}{x} + frac{m}{x^2} = 0, which simplifies to: x + m = 0. Case 1: If m geq 0, then f'(x) > 0 for all x in (0, +infty), meaning that f(x) is strictly increasing on its entire domain. Therefore, the minimum value on the interval [1, e] would be at x=1, that is f(1) = ln 1 - m = -m, which should equal 4. However, we would obtain m = -4, which contradicts our assumption that m geq 0. Hence, we must discard this option. Case 2: If m < 0, there are three subcases to consider: Subcase 2.1: If -m < 1 (which means -1 < m < 0), f(x) is strictly increasing on the interval [1, e], so the minimum value of f(x) would still be f(1) = -m, leading to m = -4. However, this again contradicts the range of m in this subcase. Subcase 2.2: If -m > e (which means m < -e), f(x) has a local minimum at x = -m because f(x) decreases on (0, -m) and increases on (-m, +infty). The minimum value of f(x) on the interval [1, e] would thus be at x=e. The condition f(e) = ln e - frac{m}{e} = 4 gives us 1 - frac{m}{e} = 4, so solving for m yields m = -3e. Subcase 2.3: If -1 leq -m leq e (which translates to -e leq m leq 1), the function f(x) has a local minimum at x = -m, but -m would fall inside the interval [1, e]. This would imply f(-m) = ln(-m) + 1 = 4. However, solving for m in this case leads to m = -e^3, which is not within the specified range -e leq m leq 1, so this subcase also leads to a contradiction.

First, let's find the remainder when (10^{23}) is divided by 6. Since 10 is congruent to 4 modulo 6 (because 10 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 4), we can say that (10^{23}) is congruent to (4^{23}) modulo 6. Now, let's find the remainder when (4^{23}) is divided by 6. We can simplify this by looking at the pattern of remainders when powers of 4 are divided by 6: - (4^1) divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 4. - (4^2) divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 4 * 4 = 16, which is 4 when divided by 6 (since 16 - 12 = 4). - (4^3) divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 4 * 4 * 4 = 64, which is 4 when divided by 6 (since 64 - 60 = 4). We can see that every power of 4, when divided by 6, leaves a remainder of 4. Therefore, (4^{23}) divided by 6 will also leave a remainder of 4. Now, we subtract 7 from (10^{23}) (which we have established is congruent to 4 modulo 6), and we want to find the remainder when this result is divided by 6. So, the remainder of (4 - 7) modulo 6 is equivalent to the remainder of (-3) modulo 6. Since (-3) is 3 less than 0, and we are looking for a positive remainder, we can add 6 to (-3) to find the equivalent positive remainder.

We are to prove that the angle ( angle xyz ) is either ( 0 ) or ( pi ). # Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Applying Menelaus' Theorem:** For ( triangle BC ) and the transveral line ( B'C' ), Menelaus' theorem states that: [ frac{xB}{xC} cdot frac{C'C}{C'O} cdot frac{B'O}{B'B} = 1 quad (1) ] 2. **Applying Menelaus' Theorem:** Similarly, for ( triangle CA ) and the transversal line ( C'A' ), Menelaus' theorem states that: [ frac{yC}{yA} cdot frac{A'A}{A'O} cdot frac{C'O}{C'C} = 1 quad (2) ] 3. **Applying Menelaus' Theorem:** Finally, for ( triangle AB ) and the transversal line ( A'B' ), Menelaus' theorem states that: [ frac{zA}{zB} cdot frac{B'B}{B'O} cdot frac{A'O}{A'A} = 1 quad (3) ] 4. **Multiplying the Three Equations:** Multiply equations (1), (2), and (3): [ left( frac{xB}{xC} cdot frac{C'C}{C'O} cdot frac{B'O}{B'B} right) cdot left( frac{yC}{yA} cdot frac{A'A}{A'O} cdot frac{C'O}{C'C} right) cdot left( frac{zA}{zB} cdot frac{B'B}{B'O} cdot frac{A'O}{A'A} right) = 1 times 1 times 1 = 1 ] 5. **Simplifying the Product:** The product of these three equations simplifies to: [ left( frac{xB}{xC} cdot frac{yC}{yA} cdot frac{zA}{zB} right) cdot left( frac{C'C}{C'O} cdot frac{A'A}{A'O} cdot frac{B'B}{B'O} right) cdot left( frac{B'O}{B'B} cdot frac{C'O}{C'C} cdot frac{A'O}{A'A} right) = 1 ] We notice that most terms cancel out due to multiplicative inverses, thus confirming the product equals ( 1 ). 6. **Conclusion:** The condition derived from applying Menelaus' theorem to the three intersecting lines ensures that ( A, B, C ) are collinear to ( A', B', C' ) respectively WLOG, implying that ( angle xyz = 0 ) or ( pi ).

That is, place (text{GCD}(x, y)) at ((x, y)). 2. **Uniqueness Across the Plane:** Each natural number appears at some point ((n, n)). This ensures every natural number is represented somewhere on the plane with integer coordinates. 3. **Line Consideration:** Let (ax + by = c) be the equation of a line that does not pass through the origin and contains at least two integer points ((x_1, y_1)) and ((x_2, y_2)). 4. **Rational Coefficients:** Since ((x_1, y_1)) and ((x_2, y_2)) are integer points, (a) and (b) can be rational numbers. For convenience, we can normalize (c) such that (c = 1). Therefore, we find rational solutions (a) and (b) for the system: [ a x_1 + b y_1 = 1 ] [ a x_2 + b y_2 = 1 ] 5. **Normalizing to Integers:** Multiply (a), (b), and (1) by a suitable natural number such that (a), (b), and (c) become integers. This enables us to write the line equation in the form (ax + by = c) with integer coefficients (a), (b), and (c). 6. **Analysis of Integer Points on the Line:** Let ((x, y)) be an integer point lying on this line. Hence, (ax + by = c). Given the initial configuration, (text{GCD}(x, y)) is a divisor of (c). 7. **Periodic Configuration:** Consider the integer point ((x - bc, y + ac)).

Let ( t ) and ( u ) be the tens and units digits respectively of an integer that satisfies the problem's conditions. 2. When these digits are swapped, the number becomes: [ 10u + t ] 3. Given that the new number is 9 more than the original, we have: [ 10u + t = 10t + u + 9 ] 4. Re-arrange this equation to isolate terms with ( t ) and ( u ): [ 10u + t - 10t - u = 9 ] 5. Combine like terms: [ 9u - 9t = 9 ] 6. Divide through by 9: [ u - t = 1 ] Thus, ( u = t + 1 ). 7.

Therefore, we have: [ OH = 2 times OL, ] where ( OL ) is the distance from ( O ) to the midpoint ( L ). 3. **Establish the line segment relationships**: Since ( OL = frac{1}{2} BH ) (as ( O ) and ( L ) share distances ( BH ) and twice of ( OL )), and ( OL parallel BH ) (because both are perpendicular to ( AC )), it follows that ( OL ) is the midline of the triangle ( BH' ): [ OL = frac{1}{2} BH. ] 4. **Midline properties**: The line segment ( OL ) is the midline of triangle ( BHL' ).

To analyze the maximum score Katy can guarantee, let's first divide the 8 times 8 board into 2 times 1 rectangles. 2. On each of Katy's turns, she places two \`K\` markers in an empty 2 times 1 rectangle. 3. **Initial Analysis**: - There are frac{64}{2} = 32 such 2 times 1 rectangles on an 8 times 8 grid. - Each rectangle can hold exactly two Ks. 4. **Alex's Moves**: - On Alex's turn, he places an \`A\` marker in one unit cell. - The placement of an \`A\` can cover 1 unit of a 2 times 1 rectangle, thus making one rectangle unusable for Katy. 5. **Katy's Moves**: - Though Alex can occupy one cell of a 2 times 1 rectangle, Katy can still place Ks in any other available 2 times 1 rectangle. 6. **Turn Analysis**: - Both players take turns, with Alex going first. - Each turn Katy can place two Ks while Alex can reduce the number of available 2 times 1 rectangles by one (because his A in any cell covers part of an unused 2 times 1 rectangle). 7. **Number of Turns**: - When the board is completely filled, every cell will contain either an \`A\` or a \`K\`. - In total, Alex will place 32 As (one per turn in 32 turns), and Katy will place 32 Ks (in two cells per turn over 16 turns since she plays half as often as Alex in each round). 8. **Alex's Strategy**: - Alex can prevent Katy from scoring more than 32 Ks by adopting a strategy of placing his A's only on one color in a chessboard pattern. For example, if the board is colored like a chessboard, Alex always places his A on black cells. 9. **Chessboard Pattern Strategy**: - This ensures the maximum reduction of 2 times 1 rectangles available, thus limiting the number of potential K placements. - There are 32 black cells and 32 white cells. Since Alex can only place As on black cells and he goes first, he will use up 16 black squares, leaving 16 black squares for Katy to use. 10. **Conclusion**: - The strategy discussed ensures that no matter which cells Katy picks, Alex limits the game to 16 turns of K placements. - Katy's guaranteed score is therefore 2 times 16 = 32 Ks on the grid.

Please provide an explanation.","completion":"To determine if 540 pieces of (1 times 2) dominoes can form a (6 times 180) rectangle such that each row and column has an odd number of stars, we will analyze the problem step by step. 1. **Calculate the total number of stars**: Each (1 times 2) domino has 2 stars. Therefore, 540 dominoes will have: [ 540 times 2 = 1080 text{ stars} ] 2. **Sum properties of odd and even numbers**: Notice that 1080 is an even number. In a grid of stars arranged in rows and columns, if we want each row and each column to have an odd number of stars, there is a property related to summing odd and even numbers: - The sum of odd numbers is an odd number if there is an odd number of odd components. - The sum of odd numbers is an even number if there is an even number of odd components. 3. **Row and column star count properties**: Let's denote the number of stars in each row by (r_i) and in each column by (c_j). For (i=1,2,ldots,6) (total 6 rows) and (j=1,2,ldots,180) (total 180 columns), we have: [ sum_{i=1}^{6} r_i = 1080 quad text{and} quad sum_{j=1}^{180} c_j = 1080 ] Both sums are equal to the even number 1080. If every row and every column needs to have an odd number of stars (i.e., individual (r_i) and (c_j) should be odd numbers), let's analyze this condition deeper: 4. **Simultaneous conditions for rows and columns**: Each of the 6 rows being odd (let's say ( r_1 = r_2 = ldots = r_6 text{ } text{are odd})) means their sum would be odd+odd+odd+odd+odd+odd. The sum of six odd numbers is an even number: [ sum_{i=1}^{6} r_i text{ is even } quad (text{sum of an even number of odd numbers}) ] Similarly, for the columns: [ sum_{j=1}^{180} c_j text{ is even } quad (text{sum of an even number of odd numbers}) ] Both sums are satisfied because (1080) is even. 5. **Conclusion**: Since the sum of each row and each column can be arranged to be an even number (even composition of odd counts), it's theoretically possible to have odd number of stars in each row and each column. To confirm this construction, consider an arrangement such as: - Each of the first five rows has 89 stars. - The sixth row has 95 stars ((5 times 89 = 445), (1080 - 445 = 95)). - Each column has 3 stars. Therefore, 540 pieces of (1 times 2) dominoes can indeed form a (6 times 180) rectangle where each row and each column has an odd number of stars.

Multiply the second expression by (b): [ b cdot (b^{10} - 2023b^2 - 41) = b^{11} - 2023b^3 - 41b ] 5. Subtract this from the first expression: [ b^{11} - 2023b^3 + 40b - (b^{11} - 2023b^3 - 41b) = 81b ] Thus, (a^2 + 1 mid 81b). 6. Notice that (3 nmid a^2 + 1) because (a^2 + 1) is always greater than 1 and not divisible by 3. Therefore, (a^2 + 1 mid b). 7. Since (a^2 + 1 mid b), we can substitute (b = k(a^2 + 1)) for some integer (k). 8. Substitute (b = k(a^2 + 1)) into the second condition: [ a^2 + 1 mid (k(a^2 + 1))^{10} - 2023(k(a^2 + 1))^2 - 41 ] Simplifying, we get: [ a^2 + 1 mid k^{10}(a^2 + 1)^{10} - 2023k^2(a^2 + 1)^2 - 41 ] Since (a^2 + 1) divides both terms involving (k), it must also divide 41. 9. Since 41 is a prime number, the only divisors of 41 are 1 and 41. Therefore, (a^2 + 1 = 1) or (a^2 + 1 = 41). 10. If (a^2 + 1 = 1), then (a^2 = 0) which implies (a = 0). 11. If (a^2 + 1 = 41), then (a^2 = 40). However, 40 is not a perfect square, so there are no integer solutions for (a) in this case. 12. Therefore, the only solution is (a = 0). For (a = 0), the conditions reduce to: [ 1 mid b^{11} - 2023b^3 + 40b ] [ 0 mid b^{10} - 2023b^2 - 41 ] which are trivially satisfied for any integer (b).

[Solution] The center of the circle is (1,-2). Since frac{-2+frac{3}{2}}{1-frac{1}{2}}=-1, the slope of the line containing the chord is 1. The equation of the line is y+frac{3}{2}=x-frac{1}{2}, or x-y-2=0. Therefore, the answer is boxed{x-y-2=0}. (3) [Analysis] This problem involves the properties of the circle system equation. It can be solved using the method of separating parameters. [Solution] The circle system equation can be transformed into (x^{2}+y^{2}-4y+2+a(-2x+2y)=0. From begin{cases}{x}^{2}+{y}^{2}-4y+2=0 -2x+2y=0end{cases}, we get begin{cases}x=1 y=1end{cases}. The circle system always passes through the fixed point (1,1). Therefore, the answer is boxed{(1,1)}. (4) [Analysis] This problem involves the equation of a line tangent to a circle. The key to solving it is to use symmetry to determine that the reflected light ray is the tangent line of the circle passing through the point (-2,-3). [Solution] The point symmetric to A(-2,3) about the x-axis is {A}^{′}(-2,-3). Let the line passing through {A}^{′}(-2,-3) be y+3=k(x+2), or kx-y+2k-3=0. The circle equation is transformed into {(x−3)}^{2}+{(y−2)}^{2}=1, and the distance from the center of the circle (3,2) to the line is equal to the radius 1. So, d=frac{|3k−2+2k−3|}{sqrt{k^{2}+1}}=1 therefore k=frac{3}{4} or k=frac{4}{3}. The line is 3x−4y−6=0 or 4x−3y−1=0. Therefore, the answer is boxed{3x−4y−6=0} or boxed{4x−3y−1=0}."},{"prompt":"A magician and his assistant perform in front of an audience of many people.

Since the sum of angles in a triangle is (180^circ), and the apex angle is (60^circ), we have: [ 60^circ + theta + theta = 180^circ ] [ 60^circ + 2theta = 180^circ ] Subtract (60^circ) from both sides: [ 2theta = 120^circ ] [ theta = 60^circ ] 5. Thus, if the apex angle is (60^circ), then each of the base angles is also (60^circ), making all three angles in the triangle (60^circ): [ angle A = angle B = angle C = 60^circ ] 6. A triangle with all three angles equal to (60^circ) is an equilateral triangle, which means all three sides must be equal. Hence, the triangle is equilateral. Case 2: One of the Base Angles is (60^circ): 7. Consider the isosceles triangle with one of the base angles being (60^circ), and the two equal sides being (a). 8. Since one base angle is (60^circ), and the two equal sides (let the sides opposite the base angles be called (b)), the other base angle (since it is an isosceles triangle) must also be (60^circ): [ 60^circ + 60^circ + theta = 180^circ ] Thus, we get: [ 120^circ + theta = 180^circ ] Solving for (theta): [ theta = 60^circ ] 9. Therefore, all three angles are equal to (60^circ), indicating the triangle is equilateral regardless of which angle is specified as (60^circ). 10. Consequently, we have shown that if any angle of an isosceles triangle is (60^circ), all angles in the triangle must be (60^circ), confirming that the triangle is equilateral. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Equilateral triangle}} ]"},{"prompt":"2sin15°cos15°=（ ） A: frac {1}{2} B: frac {1}{2} C: frac { sqrt {3}}{2} D: frac { sqrt {3}}{2}","completion":"Solution: 2sin15^circcos15^circ=sin30^circ= frac {1}{2}.

To ensure that such an integer (n) exists, it suffices to show that: [ sqrt{ab} + 1 le sqrt{(a + c)(b + d)} ] 4. Squaring both sides of the inequality (sqrt{ab} + 1 le sqrt{(a + c)(b + d)}), we get: [ (sqrt{ab} + 1)^2 le (a + c)(b + d) ] 5.

Hence, (a-1 mid 0) is always true. - Therefore, ((a, b) = (a, 1)) is a solution for any positive integer (a). 3.

Factoring out z + 2 again, we get: [(z + 2)^2 (z^2 - 4) = 0.] Next, we factorize z^2 - 4 further into: [(z + 2)^2 (z + 2)(z - 2) = 0.] Thus, the solutions are z = -2 (with multiplicity 2) and z = 2. However, since we need the fourth roots of -16, we need to account for complex roots as well. Note that the fourth roots of -16 are not purely real. We rewrite -16 using polar form: [-16 = 16(cos pi + isin pi).] The fourth roots are then given by: [ z = sqrt[4]{16} left( cosleft(frac{pi + 2kpi}{4}right) + isinleft(frac{pi + 2kpi}{4}right) right) text{ for } k = 0, 1, 2, 3 ] [ z = 2 left( cosleft(frac{pi}{4}right) + isinleft(frac{pi}{4}right) right) = 2left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}} + ifrac{1}{sqrt{2}}right) = sqrt{2} + isqrt{2} ] [ z = 2 left( cosleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) + isinleft(frac{3pi}{4}right) right) = 2left(-frac{1}{sqrt{2}} + ifrac{1}{sqrt{2}}right) = -sqrt{2} + isqrt{2} ] [ z = 2 left( cosleft(frac{5pi}{4}right) + isinleft(frac{5pi}{4}right) right) = 2left(-frac{1}{sqrt{2}} - ifrac{1}{sqrt{2}}right) = -sqrt{2} - isqrt{2} ] [ z = 2 left( cosleft(frac{7pi}{4}right) + isinleft(frac{7pi}{4}right) right) = 2left(frac{1}{sqrt{2}} - ifrac{1}{sqrt{2}}right) = sqrt{2} - isqrt{2} ] Thus, the solutions are boxed{sqrt{2} + isqrt{2}, -sqrt{2} + isqrt{2}, -sqrt{2} - isqrt{2}, sqrt{2} - isqrt{2}}."},{"prompt":"it true that any two rectangles of equal area can be arranged on a plane such that any horizontal line intersecting one of them will also intersect the other, and moreover, with a segment of the same length?","completion":"1. **Given Data:** - Let there be two rectangles of equal area: - Rectangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1} with sides a_{1} and b_{1}. - Rectangle A_{2} B_{2} C_{2} D_{2} with sides a_{2} and b_{2}. 2. **Equality of Area:** - Since the areas are equal: [ a_{1} cdot b_{1} = a_{2} cdot b_{2} ] 3. **Assumptions:** - Without loss of generality, assume a_{1} < b_{2} and a_{2} < b_{1} (if ( a_{1} = b_{2} ) and ( a_{2} = b_{1} ), the statement is trivially true). 4. **Placement of Rectangles:** - Place the rectangles as shown in the figure to be analyzed. ![Rectangles Configuration](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_78a338f936ec2a37fae8g-37.jpg?height=283&width=397&top_left_y=1099&top_left_x=836) 5. **Parallel Sides:** - Observe that A_{1} A_{2} | C_{1} C_{2} (i.e., sides A_{1} A_{2} and C_{1} C_{2} are parallel). 6. **Use Similar Triangles:** - By similarity of triangles, we get: [ frac{h_{1}}{h} = frac{b_{1} - c_{2}}{a_{2}} quad text{and} quad frac{h_{2}}{h} = frac{b_{2} - a_{1}}{a_{1}} ] 7. **Equality of Heights:** - As we know a_{1} b_{1} = a_{2} b_{2}, equating the expressions from the ratio, we get: [ frac{b_{1} - c_{2}}{a_{2}} = frac{b_{2} - a_{1}}{a_{1}} ] - Therefore, it follows that h_{1} = h_{2} and hence A_{1} A_{2} | C_{1} C_{2}. 8. **Properties of Quadrilaterals:** - This implies the quadrilaterals A_{1} E_{1} C_{1} C_{2} and A_{2} E_{2} C_{2} C_{1} are parallelograms. 9. **Equal Sides in Parallelograms:** - Consequently, sides A_{1} E_{1} = A_{2} E_{2} and the areas of the parallelograms are equal. - Therefore, due to the equality of the areas of the rectangles, the areas of triangles A_{1} B_{1} E_{1} and A_{2} B_{2} E_{2} are also equal. 10. **Equal Heights:** - Since A_{1} E_{1} = A_{2} E_{2}, their heights are also equal. Hence, B_{1} B_{2} | A_{1} A_{2}. 11. **Conclusion on Intersection by Horizontal Line:** - Thus, any horizontal line intersecting one of these triangles will intersect the other triangle along equal segments. - If a horizontal line intersects the parallelograms A_{1} E_{1} C_{1} C_{2} and A_{2} E_{2} C_{2} C_{1} or the triangles C_{1} D_{2} C_{2} and C_{1} D_{1} C_{2}, it obviously intersects equal segments. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{True}} ]"},{"prompt":"We call a permutation (a_1, a_2,cdots , a_n) of the set { 1,2,cdots, n} good if for any three natural numbers i <j <k , nnmid a_i+a_k2a_j find all natural numbers nge 3 such that there exist a good permutation of a set {1,2,cdots, n} .","completion":"1. **Restate the problem in a more convenient form:** We will operate on the set ({0, 1, ldots, n-1}) instead of ({1, 2, ldots, n}). This does not change the nature of the problem but simplifies the arithmetic. 2. **Analyze the condition for a permutation to be \\"good\\":** For (3 leq k leq n), we need: [ a_1 + a_k notequiv 2a_2 pmod{n} ] This implies: [ a_k notequiv 2a_2 - a_1 pmod{n} ] Therefore, (2a_2 - a_1) must not be congruent to any (a_i) for (i neq 2). 3. **Consider the implications of the above condition:** Clearly, (2a_2 - a_1 notequiv a_2) because that would imply (a_1 equiv a_2), which is a contradiction. Thus, we must have: [ 2a_2 - a_1 equiv a_1 pmod{n} implies 2a_2 equiv 2a_1 pmod{n} ] If (n) is odd, this reduces to: [ a_2 equiv a_1 pmod{n} ] which is a contradiction. Therefore, (n) must be even. 4. **Consider the structure of the permutation:** We can divide the permutation into two subsets: one consisting of even numbers and the other of odd numbers. If the original permutation is \\"good\\", then the even subset divided by two and the odd subset subtracted by one and divided by two must also be \\"good\\". 5. **Inductive step:** If ({2a_1, 2a_2, ldots, 2a_{n/2}}) is good modulo (2n), then ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n/2}}) is good modulo (n) (by dividing everything by two). Similarly, if ({2a_1 + 1, 2a_2 + 1, ldots, 2a_{n/2} + 1}) is good modulo (2n), then ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n/2}}) is good modulo (n). 6. **Conclusion from the inductive step:** For a size (n) permutation to be good, a size (n/2) permutation must also be good. If (n = a cdot 2^b) where (a) is odd, it follows that for a size (n) permutation to be good, a size (a) permutation must also be good. However, unless (a = 1), this is impossible as shown above. Thus, (n) must be a power of 2. 7. **Construction of a \\"good\\" permutation:** If we permute the numbers in ({1, 2, ldots, n}) such that one half is exclusively odd and the other exclusively even, then choosing any (i) in one half and (k) in the other half will not yield an (a_j) because (a_i + a_k) is odd while (2a_j) is even. Thus, we just need to worry about each half individually, and this can be resolved with the induction step.

We want this total to be a multiple of 2 since he can pack 2 CDs in each box. The sum of the rock and pop CDs is 14 + 8 = 22. Since 22 is already an even number (a multiple of 2), we need to add an even number of classical CDs to keep the total even. This means that C must also be an even number.

Differentiate g(x): [ g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(e^x + e^{-x} - x^2 - 2) = e^x - e^{-x} - 2x ] 2. Define varphi(x) = g'(x) and find its derivative: [ varphi'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(e^x - e^{-x} - 2x) = e^x + e^{-x} - 2 ] 3. Analyze varphi'(x): [ varphi'(x) = e^x + e^{-x} - 2 geq 2sqrt{e^x cdot e^{-x}} - 2 = 0 ] This inequality holds because of the AM-GM inequality, with equality if and only if x = 0. 4. Since varphi'(x) geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R}, and varphi'(x) = 0 only when x = 0, varphi(x) (and hence g'(x)) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}. 5. Given g'(0) = 0, we conclude: - On (-infty, 0), g'(x) < 0, so g(x) is monotonically decreasing. - On (0, +infty), g'(x) > 0, so g(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0) and monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). Part (Ⅱ) - Proving the statements about f(x) # (i) f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R} 1. Differentiate f(x): [ f'(x) = e^x - x - acos x ] 2. Since -1 leqslant a leqslant 1, we have |acos x| leqslant 1, leading to: [ f'(x) geqslant e^x - x - 1 ] 3. Define h(x) = e^x - x - 1 and differentiate: [ h'(x) = e^x - 1 ] 4. Since h'(x) > 0 for x > 0 and h'(x) < 0 for x < 0, h(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0) and monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). 5. At x = 0, h(x) = 0. Therefore, h(x) geqslant 0 for all x in mathbb{R}, implying f'(x) geqslant 0. Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}. # (ii) If |f'(x)| leqslant M, then |f(x)| leqslant M for x in [-frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{3}] 1. From (i), since f(x) is monotonically increasing and f(0) = 0, f(x) < 0 for x < 0 and f(x) > 0 for x > 0. 2. The function y = |f(x)| is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 0) and monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). 3. The maximum value of |f(x)| within [-frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{3}] is either |f(-frac{pi}{3})| or |f(frac{pi}{3})|. Calculations show: [ |f(x)|_{max} = maxleft{|f(-frac{pi}{3})|, |f(frac{pi}{3})|right} = e^{frac{pi}{3}} - frac{pi^2}{18} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a - 1 ] 4. Comparing |f'(frac{pi}{3})| and |f(frac{pi}{3})|, we find: [ |f'(frac{pi}{3})| - |f(frac{pi}{3})| > 0 ] This implies |f'(x)|_{max} > |f(x)|_{max} within the given interval. Therefore, if |f'(x)| leqslant M, then |f(x)| leqslant M for x in [-frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{3}].

Similarly, [ begin{aligned} left( -frac{1}{c+1} right)^3 - 3 left( -frac{1}{c+1} right) - 1 &= -frac{1}{(c+1)^3} left( 1 - 3(c+1)^2 + (c+1)^3 right) &= -frac{1}{(c+1)^3} left( c^3 - 3c - 1 right) = 0. end{aligned} ] 3.

Since ( f(1) = -3 < 0 ) and ( f(2) = 1 > 0 ), there exists a root ( c ) in the interval ( 1 < c < 2 ). Thus, ( -frac{c+1}{c} ) and ( -frac{1}{c+1} ) must be negative, hence we can set: [ x_1 = -frac{c+1}{c}, quad x_2 = -frac{1}{c+1}, quad x_3 = c. ] 5. Now we compute: [ x_3^2 - x_2^2 - x_3 + x_1 = c^2 - left( -frac{1}{(c+1)^2} right) - c - left( -frac{c+1}{c} right). ] 6. Combining all terms under a common denominator: [ begin{aligned} &= frac{c^5 + 2c^4 + c^3 - 2c^3 - 2c^2 - c - (c+1)^3}{c(c+1)^2} &= frac{c^5 + c^4 - c - 1}{c(c+1)^2} &= frac{(c^2 + c + 1)(c^3 - 3c - 1)}{c(c+1)^2} = 0. end{aligned} ] This proves the given statement. Second Solution Using Vieta's formulas for the polynomial ( x^3 - 3x - 1 = 0 ), we have: 1. [ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 0, ] [ x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3 = -3, ] [ x_1 x_2 x_3 = 1. ] 2.

Given ( x_1 < x_2 < x_3 ): [ x_2 = frac{-x_1^2 + sqrt{x_1^4 - 4x_1}}{2x_1}, quad x_3 = frac{-x_1^2 - sqrt{x_1^4 - 4x_1}}{2x_1}. ] 5. Calculating: [ x_3^2 - x_2^2 - x_3 + x_1 = frac{4x_1^2 sqrt{x_1^4 - 4x_1}}{4x_1^2} + frac{x_1^2 + sqrt{x_1^4 - 4x_1}}{2x_1} + x_1. ] 6. The equation will break down into: [ frac{(2x_1 + 1) sqrt{x_1^4 - 4x_1} + 3x_1^2}{2x_1}, ] which equal to zero when: [ 3 x_1^2 = -(2x_1 + 1) sqrt{x_1^4 - 4x_1}. ] Thus, considering both methods, we have proved that: [ x_3^2 - x_2^2 = x_3 - x_1. ] (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"The geometric mean of a set of (n) positive numbers is defined as the (n)th root of the product of those numbers.

Since only 2 of them are adjacent, there are two possible scenarios for their arrangement: 1. The 3 lights form a pattern like \\"adjacent, adjacent, separate,\\" which can occur in 4 different positions across the 6 lights. 2. The 3 lights form a pattern like \\"separate, adjacent, adjacent,\\" which can also occur in 4 different positions across the 6 lights. Therefore, there are a total of 4 + 4 = 8 ways to arrange the 3 lights. Next, considering the color of each light, since each light can be red, yellow, or blue, for 3 lights, there are 3 times 3 times 3 = 27 possible color combinations. Multiplying the number of arrangements by the number of color combinations gives the total number of different signals that can be displayed: 8 times 27 = 216. However, the correct calculation should consider that each of the 3 lights can independently choose any of the 3 colors, leading to 3^3 = 27 color combinations for each arrangement. Since there are 4 positions for the \\"adjacent, adjacent, separate\\" arrangement and 4 positions for the \\"separate, adjacent, adjacent\\" arrangement, we should calculate the total arrangements as 4 + 4 = 8 positions. Thus, the total number of different signals is 8 times 27 = 216. It appears there was a mistake in the initial calculation.

Therefore, the equation of line l is y-2=x-3, or equivalently, boxed{x-y-1=0}. (2) Note that the focus of the parabola C is F(1,0), which satisfies the equation of line l: x-y-1=0. Let A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}) be the intersection points of line l and the parabola C. Since F is the focus and A and B are on the parabola, we have |AB|=|FA|+|FB|=(x_{1}+1)+(x_{2}+1).

Suppose the set is: [ a, b, 6, 6 ] - Median: Since there are four elements, the median is the average of the middle two numbers. Hence, [ frac{b + 6}{2} = 3 implies b + 6 = 6 implies b = 0. ] But, - Since the mean is 5, [ frac{a + b + 6 + 6}{4} = 5 implies frac{a + 0 + 6 + 6}{4} = 5 implies frac{a + 12}{4} = 5 implies a + 12 = 20 implies a = 8. ] - This leads to a contradiction since (a leq b), and (b = 0.) 4. **Sets with Five Elements**: Let us try a set with five elements.

By substituting -x into the given expression, we get f(-x) = log_{frac{1}{2}}(-(-x) + 1) = log_{frac{1}{2}}(x + 1). 2.

Given the monotonicity of f(x), we deduce that |a-1| > 1.
