Let the greatest common divisor of the integers ( b ) and ( p - a ) be denoted by ( d ). We can express this as: [ d = gcd(b, p-a) ] 2. Since ( d ) divides both ( b ) and ( p-a ), we can write: [ b = k cdot d quad text{and} quad p - a = l cdot d ] for some integers ( k ) and ( l ). 3. Now, notice that substituting ( p-a = l cdot d ) gives: [ a = p - l cdot d ] 4. We claim that the integers ( k ) and ( l ) are coprime. To prove this, suppose there exists a common divisor ( g ) such that ( g ) divides both ( k ) and ( l ). Then ( g ) should also divide: [ b = k cdot d ] and [ p - a = l cdot d ] Since ( d ) is already the greatest common divisor of ( b ) and ( p - a ), it must be that ( g ) divides ( d ). But, given ( k ) and ( l ) only factor from ( d ), ( g ) dividing ( k ) and ( l ) contradicts ( d ) being the greatest common divisor unless ( g = 1 ). Hence, ( k ) and ( l ) are coprime. 5.

From the equation f(x)-g(2-x)=4, we can substitute x with -x to obtain f(-x)-g(x+2)=4. This implies that g(x+2)=f(-x)-4. 2. Given g(x)+f(x-4)=6, if we replace x with x+2, we get g(x+2)+f(x-2)=6. From this, we deduce that g(x+2)=6-f(x-2). 3. Using the same equation g(x)+f(x-4)=6, but replacing x with x+1, we obtain g(x+1)+f(x-3)=6. 4. From the initial equation f(x)-g(2-x)=4, replacing x with x-1, we get f(x-1)-g(3-x)=4. 5. Given g(3-x)+g(x+1)=0, we can combine this with the previous results to get g(x+1)+f(x-3)-[f(x-1)-g(3-x)]=2, which simplifies to f(x-3)-f(x-1)=2. This implies that f(x)=f(x+2)+2. 6. From the implication that f(x)=f(x+2)+2, we can deduce that f(x-2)=f(x)+2. Therefore, g(x+2)=6-f(x-2)=4-f(x). 7. Combining the results, we find that f(-x)-4=4-f(x), which leads to f(-x)+f(x)=8. This indicates that f(x) is symmetric about the point (0,4). 8. We also deduce that f(x)+x=f(x+2)+x+2. Letting h(x)=f(x)+x, we find that h(x)=h(x+2), meaning h(x) has a period of 2. 9.

For 2 copies of type A and 3 copies of type B: 2x + 3y = 290 Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows: - Multiply the first equation by 2 to eliminate x when subtracted from the second equation: - 2(x + 2y) = 2 cdot 170 Rightarrow 2x + 4y = 340 - Subtract the first modified equation from the second original equation: - (2x + 3y) - (2x + 4y) = 290 - 340 Rightarrow -y = -50 Rightarrow y = 50 - Substitute y = 50 into the first original equation: - x + 2(50) = 170 Rightarrow x + 100 = 170 Rightarrow x = 70 Therefore, the price of each type A dictionary is boxed{70} dollars, and the price of each type B dictionary is boxed{50} dollars.

The task is to determine the number and types of color shades that will appear on the cube after wrapping it with different colors of yarn around four specific axes. 1. **Understanding the Problem**: When a cube is rotated around one of its main diagonal axes, and yarn is wrapped around it, it will color only half of the cube's surface. The four axes in question connect opposite vertices of the cube. Each wiring will use different colored yarn: black, red, yellow, and blue. 2. **Visualizing the Process**: - The axes of rotation will be one of the four space diagonals of the cube. Let's denote them as AC', DB', BD', and CA'. - Considering rotation around one axis (e.g., AC'), the yarn will cover all faces passing through edges perpendicular to this axis. 3. **Coloring Analysis**: - When wrapped around axis AC', if the yarn is black, it will cover half of the cube's surface: specifically all the triangular areas that do not touch axis AC'. - Repeating this process for each axis with different colors will lead to the cube being covered in overlapping regions by different yarn colors. 4. **Calculating the Color Combinations**: - Each wrapping process introduces a new color, overlaying on parts of the surface already colored by previous wrappings. - Since a cube has 6Faces and 12Edges, each wrapping effectively splits the faces further into smaller sections. 5. **Determining Unique Shades**: - By tracking the overlays, the end result gives distinct patterns where different combinations of the four colors appear. - The number of distinct shades formed by combinations of coverage can be analyzed using combinatorial reasoning: 1. Each face has sections colored uniquely based on the two regions affected by each axis wrapping. 2.

Since Sandy's monthly phone bill expense is equal to ten times her age now, we can set up the following equation: 10 * Sandy's age = 340 Now, we solve for Sandy's age: Sandy's age = 340 / 10 Sandy's age = 34 So, Sandy is currently 34 years old. In two years, Sandy will be 34 + 2 = 36 years old. Now, we need to find out how old Kim will be in two years. Since Kim is currently 10 years old, in two years, Kim will be: 10 + 2 = 12 years old Now, we need to find the multiple that Sandy's age in two years (36 years old) is of Kim's age in two years (12 years old). We set up the following equation: Sandy's age in two years / Kim's age in two years = multiple 36 / 12 = multiple So, the multiple is: multiple = 36 / 12 multiple = 3 Therefore, in two years, Sandy will be boxed{3} times as old as Kim."},{"prompt":"A number when multiplied by a certain value is odd and divisible by 9.

To check if our answer is correct, we can verify that 27, when multiplied by a certain value, is odd and divisible by 9. Since 27 is already divisible by 9, we just need to ensure that it can be multiplied by a certain value to remain odd.

But checking combinations leads to contradictions in each case, as no valid combination of two other false statements (from 3, 4, 5) aligns with the remaining statements. - **Statement 3**: Claims three statements are false. If true, then two statements are true. Checking combinations, the only consistent scenario is Statements 3, 4, and 5 being false, and Statements 1 and 2 being true. This holds since: - Statement 1 being true fits with the claim that exactly one statement (Statement 5) is false. - Statement 2 being true fits with the claim that exactly two statements (Statements 4 and 5) are false. - **Statement 4**: States four statements are false. If true, then Statement 5 must also be true to not contradict itself, which is not possible (as Statement 5 claims all are false). - **Statement 5**: If true, then all statements are false, including itself, which is a contradiction. **Conclusion**: By thorough analysis, the only non-contradictory scenario is when Statements 3, 4, and 5 are false, making Statements 1 and 2 true. Therefore, there are exactly three false statements on the card. text{3} The final answer is boxed{C}"},{"prompt":"Anthony bought a dozen bananas. He ate 2 of the bananas.

Then, the pyramid OABC and pyramid ABCD will have different volumes since one has a square base and the others are triangular prisms. Therefore, the volume ratio of the pyramid OABC to ABCD is 1:4. This implies the volume ratio of their heights is the same since all other factors (base area) remain constant. We assume OABC and ABCD share a common height h, so r = frac{h}{4}. However, since the inradius plus the circumscribed radius (to the apex) fits exactly the height of the pyramid (h = r + R), it follows that r = frac{R}{3}. The radius of an external sphere at any triangular face, centered and tangential to that face and the circumscribed sphere, would be approximately frac{R-r}{2} = frac{R}{3}, which equals r. Therefore, the volume of each of these external spheres is frac{4}{3}pi r^3, just like the internal sphere. Since the pyramid inscribes 5 such equal spheres (one inside and four outside), and they are non-intersecting, the total volume of the spheres is 5 times frac{4}{3}pi r^3 = frac{20}{3} pi r^3. The volume of the circumscribed sphere is frac{4}{3}pi R^3 = frac{4}{3}pi (3r)^3 = 36pi r^3.

An isosceles trapezoid can be divided into any number of smaller isosceles trapezoids by drawing parallel lines to the base. Each such isosceles trapezoid will always have a circumscribed circle, hence the quadrilateral divides readily into smaller cyclic quadrilaterals. 3. **General Quadrilateral (ABCD):** Now consider a general cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD) that is not necessarily an isosceles trapezoid. To solve this, follow these steps: 4. **Angle Considerations:** Assume the angles are ordered such that (angle A geq angle C) and (angle D geq angle B). Given that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to (180^circ): [ angle A + angle C = angle B + angle D = 180^circ ] From this, it follows that: [ angle A geq angle B quad text{and} quad angle D geq angle C ] 5. **Construction of Lines:** Draw points (P) and (Q) within the quadrilateral such that (angle BAP = angle B) and (angle CDQ = angle C). Ensure that the line segment (PQ) is parallel to (AD) and lies entirely within the quadrilateral. Next, construct parallel lines: [ PR parallel AB quad text{and} quad QS parallel DC ] This constructs three smaller quadrilaterals (APQD), (ABRP), and (CDQS), all of which are trapezoids. 6. **Verification of Cyclic Nature:** Due to the construction: [ angle BAP = angle B quad text{and} quad angle CDQ = angle C ] Also, since: [ angle B + angle ADC = angle C + angle BAD = 180^circ ] It implies: [ angle DAP = angle BAD - angle B = angle ADC - angle C = angle ADQ ] Thus, ensuring (APQD), (ABRP), and (CDQS) are indeed cyclic quadrilaterals. 7. **Conclusion:** The quadrilateral (ABCD) has now been divided into three smaller cyclic quadrilaterals. Using the same construction iteratively, any of these smaller quadrilaterals can further be subdivided into smaller cyclic quadrilaterals such that for any (n geq 4), the original quadrilateral (ABCD) can be divided into (n) cyclic quadrilaterals, affirming the initial requirement. Thus, it is possible to decompose any cyclic quadrilateral into (n) cyclic quadrilaterals for any (n geq 4). boxed{} \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"Find all pairs of positive integers (x,y) for which x^3 + y^3 = 4(x^2y + xy^2 5) .","completion":"1.

By expressing cos C or cos A using the cosine theorem and substituting the values of a and b, we can derive inequalities for c based on cos C or cos A being less than 0. Solving these inequalities and finding the intersection of the ranges for c gives us the possible values for c. **Solution** Given a=4 and b=3, it follows that 4-3 < c < 4+3, i.e., 1 < c < 7. Since triangle ABC is an obtuse triangle, when c is at its maximum, then C is obtuse, thus cos C < 0, according to the cosine theorem, cos C= dfrac {a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}{2ab} < 0, which implies a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2} < 0, i.e., c^{2} > 4^{2}+3^{2}=25, solving this gives: c > 5, thus 5 < c < 7, so the range of values for the largest side c is (5,7), when a is at its maximum, then A is obtuse, thus cos A < 0, according to the cosine theorem, cos A= dfrac{{b}^{2}+{c}^{2}-{a}^{2}}{2bc} < 0, which implies b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2} < 0, i.e., c^{2} < 4^{2}-3^{2}=7, solving this gives: - sqrt{7} < c < sqrt{7} , thus 1 < c < sqrt{7} , therefore, the range of values for c is (1, sqrt{7} )cup (5,7), Hence, the answer is boxed{(1, sqrt{7} )cup (5,7)}."},{"prompt":"me sources of a person are divided into three different categories: A, B, and C.

The factorial of 5 is sufficient to cancel the powers of 2 and 3. Therefore, we set b_1 = 5. 5. **Calculation of |a_1 - b_1|**: We have a_1 = 7 and b_1 = 5. Therefore, the absolute difference is |7 - 5| = 2. 6. **Verification of the Expression**: We now express 2100 as frac{7! cdot 6!}{5! cdot 4!}. Here: - 7! provides the factors of 7, 5, 3, and 2. - 6! provides additional factors of 5, 3, and 2. - 5! cdot 4! in the denominator cancels out the suitable factors to yield 2100. 7. **Conclusion**: The smallest possible value of |a_1 - b_1| under the given conditions is 2.

Consider a trapezoid (ABCD) with (AB) and (CD) as the parallel bases, where (AB < CD). 2. Let us divide this trapezoid into two geometrical shapes: a parallelogram and a triangle. We can achieve this division by drawing a line parallel to the bases from one vertex of the smaller base (AB). For instance, extend line (AB) to (E) such that (BE) is parallel to (AD) and join (E) to (D) to form parallelogram (ABED) and triangle (CDE). 3. Notice that the sum of angles at the larger base (CD) can be represented as the sum of two adjacent angles of the triangle (CDE). Let these angles be (angle CDE) and (angle DCE). 4. By the properties of a triangle, we know the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is (180^circ). Therefore: [ angle CDE + angle DCE = 180^circ - angle DEC ] where (angle DEC) is the angle at vertex (E) without the triangle (CDE). 5. On the other hand, the two angles adjacent to the smaller base (AB) in the parallelogram (ABED) make up supplementary angles because they are internal angles on the same side of the transversal (AE) that crosses the parallel lines (AB) and (ED). So we have: [ angle BAD + angle ADB = 180^circ + angle ADE ] where (angle ADE) exists because it is a part of the adjacent angle sum in parallelogram and matches the triangle positioning. 6. Thus, comparing both relationships, the sum of angles at the smaller base is (180^circ + alpha), where (alpha) represents an additional acute angle part of larger angular measures in the formed triangle and parallelogram arrangement process. 7. Hence, the sum of angles at the larger base is exactly (180^circ), whereas the sum of angles at the smaller base exceeds (180^circ) because of the additional acute component allowed from the parallelogram orientation. # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the sum of angles at the smaller base (AB) is greater than the sum of angles at the larger base (CD) in trapezoid (ABCD). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given positive numbers ( b ) and ( c ), prove the inequality ((bc)^{2011}(b+c)^{2011}(cb)^{2011} geq left(b^{2011}c^{2011}right)left(b^{2011}+c^{2011}right)left(c^{2011}b^{2011}right)).","completion":"1. **Lemma Statement**: **For any real numbers ( x geq y geq 0 ) and a natural number ( n ), the inequality ( x^{n} - y^{n} geq (x - y)^{n} ) holds.** We start by proving this lemma which will be essential for the main proof. 2. **Proof of Lemma**: Let ( x = y + t ) where ( t geq 0 ).

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2. So, the area of circle X is: A_x = π(9)^2 A_x = 81π Since circles X and Y have the same area, the area of circle Y is also 81π.

There are two main cases to consider: **Case #1: Pattern +,-,+,-** - This pattern implies that the sequence increases, decreases, increases, and decreases. We need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to this pattern. **Subcases for Case #1:** 1. **Subcase (1): underline{hspace{3mm}}3underline{hspace{3mm}}5underline{hspace{3mm}}** - The sequence must start with a number less than 3, followed by 3, then a number less than 5 but greater than 3, followed by 5, and finally a number less than 5. The possible numbers for the first two blanks are 1 and 2 in some order, and the last blank must be 4. This gives 2! = 2 possibilities. 2. **Subcase (2): underline{hspace{3mm}}5underline{hspace{3mm}}3underline{hspace{3mm}}** - The sequence starts with a number less than 5, followed by 5, then a number less than 3, followed by 3, and finally a number greater than 3. The possible numbers for the first blank are 1, 2, 4 in some order, and the last blank must be 4. This gives 2! = 2 possibilities. 3. **Subcase (3): underline{hspace{3mm}}4underline{hspace{3mm}}5underline{hspace{3mm}}** - The sequence starts with a number less than 4, followed by 4, then a number less than 5 but greater than 4, followed by 5, and finally a number less than 5. The possible numbers for the first two blanks are 1, 2, 3 in any order, giving 3! = 6 possibilities. 4. **Subcase (4): underline{hspace{3mm}}5underline{hspace{3mm}}4underline{hspace{3mm}}** - The sequence starts with a number less than 5, followed by 5, then a number less than 4, followed by 4, and finally a number greater than 4. The possible numbers for the first two blanks are 1, 2, 3 in any order, giving 3! = 6 possibilities. Adding up all possibilities for Case #1, we get 2 + 2 + 6 + 6 = 16. **Case #2: Pattern -,+,-,+** - By symmetry, this case will have the same number of valid permutations as Case #1, which is 16. Conclusion: Adding the possibilities from both cases, we have 16 + 16 = 32 valid permutations.

Since f'(x) is a linear function, it will be non-positive if the constant term is negative or zero, thus we require: 2a leq -2 or equivalently: a leq -1 Now, the interval [a+1, 1] falls entirely within the region where f(x) is decreasing. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) on the interval will occur at the left endpoint, x = a+1, and the minimum value will occur at the right endpoint, x = 1. The maximum value of f(x) within the interval [a+1, 1] is: f(a+1) = (a+1)^2 + 2a(a+1) + 3 = a^2 + 2a + 1 + 2a^2 + 2a + 3 = 3a^2 + 4a + 4 The minimum value of f(x) within the interval is: f(1) = 1^2 + 2a cdot 1 + 3 = 4 + 2a Hence, the function g(a), which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, is: g(a) = f(a+1) - f(1) = (3a^2 + 4a + 4) - (4 + 2a) = 3a^2 + 2a Completing the square for g(a) to find its minimum value when a leq -1: g(a) = 3 left(a^2 + frac{2}{3}aright) = 3left(a^2 + frac{2}{3}a + left(frac{1}{3}right)^2right) - 3left(frac{1}{3}right)^2 = 3left(a + frac{1}{3}right)^2 - frac{1}{3} Since the square of a real number is always non-negative, and the coefficient of the squared term is positive, g(a) achieves its minimum value when the square term is zero, i.e., a = -frac{1}{3}.

Какое наименьшее общее количество видов кактусов может быть во всех коллекциях? 1. **Initial Construction:** - Let the number of different kinds of cacti be (k). - We need to show that the number cannot be less than 16. 2. **Construction Example for 16 Species:** - Number the kinds of cacti from 1 to 16. - Assume the collections are arranged as follows: - The 1st collector has all kinds except the 1st one. - The 2nd collector has all kinds except the 2nd one. - … - The 15th collector has all kinds except the 15th one. - The 16th to 80th collectors have all kinds except the 16th one. - This way, any group of 15 collectors will share at least one common type of cactus. 3. **Verification that 15 is Insufficient:** - Suppose, for contradiction, that (k leq 15). - Number the kinds of cacti from 1 to (k). - For each kind of cactus (i) (from 1 to (k)): - There exists at least one collector who does not have cactus (i). - Denote this collector as (A_i). 4. **Contradiction Argument:** - Consider the collectors (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k): - These (k) collectors each lack at least one unique kind of cactus. - Therefore, in this group, no single cactus appears in all collections. - By our assumption, (k leq 15); thus, these (k) collectors will fail to have a common cactus. - This contradicts the given condition that any 15 collectors must have a common cactus. 5. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, (k > 15). - We have already demonstrated a construction with (k = 16).

Since the retailer buys 80 pens for the price of 36 pens, we can find the cost price per pen by dividing the total cost by the number of pens bought. Let's assume the market price of each pen is 1 (for simplicity, since we don't have the actual market price). The total cost for 36 pens would then be 36 * 1 = 36. Now, since the retailer gets 80 pens for this price, the cost price per pen for the retailer is: Cost Price per pen = Total Cost / Number of Pens Cost Price per pen = 36 / 80 Cost Price per pen = 0.45 Next, let's calculate the selling price per pen after a 1% discount. If the market price is 1 per pen, a 1% discount would be 1 * 0.01 = 0.01. Therefore, the selling price per pen after the discount would be: Selling Price per pen = Market Price per pen - Discount Selling Price per pen = 1 - 0.01 Selling Price per pen = 0.99 Now, let's calculate the profit per pen: Profit per pen = Selling Price per pen - Cost Price per pen Profit per pen = 0.99 - 0.45 Profit per pen = 0.54 To find the profit percentage, we use the formula: Profit % = (Profit per pen / Cost Price per pen) * 100 Profit % = (0.54 / 0.45) * 100 Profit % = 1.2 * 100 Profit % = 120% Therefore, the retailer's profit percentage is boxed{120%} ."},{"prompt":"A point (x,y) is randomly selected such that 0 le x le 5 and 0 le y le 6.

Further simplification gives us: frac{b}{2} + frac{1}{4} + frac{7}{4} = -frac{3a}{4}, which we can recast as: frac{b}{2} + frac{8}{4} = -frac{3a}{4}. Hence, frac{b}{2} + 2 = -frac{3a}{4}.

This leads us to two simultaneous equations: 1. x + y - 3 = 0 2. (x - 2y)^2 = 0 From equation 2, we can deduce that x - 2y = 0 because the square of a number is zero if and only if the number itself is zero.

Substituting x = 2y into equation 1 gives us 2y + y - 3 = 0, which simplifies to 3y - 3 = 0. Solving for y, we find y = 1. Substituting y = 1 back into x = 2y gives us x = 2(1) = 2.

Therefore, the fraction of time spent on jackets is: [ frac{3}{3+2} = frac{3}{5} ] If Factory B spends all its time on jackets for a month, the number of jackets produced would be: [ frac{3600}{frac{3}{5}} = 3600 times frac{5}{3} = 6000 text { jackets} ] 2. **Calculate the time needed for Factory A to produce 6000 trousers:** Factory A's time ratio for jackets to trousers is 2:1.

The derivative of f(x) is f'(x)=e^{x}-1. For x in the interval (0,+infty), we have f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is an increasing function on this interval. Therefore, evaluating f(x) at 0.1 and comparing it to its value at 0, we get f(0.1) > f(0), which simplifies to e^{0.1}-0.1-1 > 0. This implies that a=e^{0.1}-1 > 0.1. **Step 2: Analyzing b=sin 0.1** Consider another function g(x)=sin x-x. The derivative, g'(x)=cos x-1, is always less than 0 for x in the interval (0,1). This means g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,1). Thus, g(0.1) < g(0), leading to sin 0.1-0.1 < 0. Consequently, we find that b=sin 0.1 < 0.1. **Step 3: Analyzing c=ln 1.1** Define h(x)=ln(x+1)-sin x. The derivative of h(x) is h'(x)=frac{1}{x+1}-cos x=frac{1-(x+1)cos x}{x+1}. Let m(x)=1-(x+1)cos x with its derivative m'(x)=-cos x+(x+1)sin x. Observing m'(x), it is increasing on (0,frac{π}{6}), and at x=frac{π}{6}, m'(frac{π}{6})=frac{-6sqrt{3}+6+π}{12} < 0. This implies m'(x) < 0 on (0,frac{π}{6}), making m(x) a decreasing function in this interval. Since m(0)=0, we conclude m(x) < 0 for x in (0,frac{π}{6}), which means h'(x) < 0 on this interval, indicating h(x) is decreasing. Therefore, h(0.1) < h(0)=0, which simplifies to ln 1.1-sin 0.1 < 0, implying c < b. **Conclusion** From the analysis above, we have established that a > 0.1, b < 0.1, and c < b.

Then, connect any two points within the same group with a line segment, and do not connect points from different groups. This forms a graph G. Different groupings result in different graphs.

Thus, the distribution ensures: [ |x_1| = |x_2| = cdots = |x_{81}| = 24, quad |x_{82}| = |x_{83}| = 25 ] 3. **Coloring each group separately:** - For group x_{i}, the subgraph G_i^* consists of complete subgraphs (complete graphs) within x_i. - To color G_i^*, we split the group into smaller subsets. For group (x_{83}), for instance, split it into 5 subsets: (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5), where each (y_i) contains 5 points. 4. **Coloring subgroups y_i:** Assume ( |y_i| = 5 ). The edges within the same y_i are colored using a specific pattern that avoids forming a monochromatic triangle. For the proof: - Let y_i = {v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5}. Color edges v_1v_2 with color (a), v_1v_3 with color (b), v_1v_4 with color (c), v_1v_5 with color (d), and so on. 5. **Coloring edges between different y_i:** For any y_i and y_j (i ne j), each edge connecting v in y_i and w in y_j is colored in such a way that no monochromatic triangles can be formed, according to the fixed pattern, using the four colors regularly. This ensures that: - If v_i in y_i and v_j in y_j for i ne j, the edge v_iv_j is properly colored. 6. **Generalizing to other groups:** Similar procedures are applied to other groups (G_{82}^* and G_i^* for i=1, 2, ldots, 81). Each segment is carefully colored to avoid forming monochromatic triangles. Larger groups may utilize slightly adjusted partition methods but adhere to restriction and coloring patterns. Consequently, the whole graph G^*, created by coloring as described, will avoid containing monochromatic triangles since within each group and between any groups, no such triangles can exist due to the edge coloring strategy. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Find the smallest natural number ( n ) such that if the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}) is arbitrarily divided into two nonintersecting subsets, then one of the subsets contains three distinct numbers such that the product of two of them equals the third.","completion":"1. **Problem Restatement:** We need to find the smallest natural number ( n ) such that if the set ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ) is arbitrarily divided into two nonintersecting subsets, then one of those subsets contains three distinct numbers such that the product of two of them equals the third. 2. **Initial Insight:** To solve this, we examine partitions of the set ( A_n = {1, 2, ldots, n} ) into two subsets ( B_n ) and ( C_n ) and look for the smallest ( n ) which ensures that either subset ( B_n ) or ( C_n ) contains three distinct numbers ( a, b, c ) such that ( ab = c ). 3. **Starting with a Trial:** Let us consider the number 96 and its prime divisors: [ 96 = 2^5 times 3 ] We aim to show that for ( n geq 96 ), one subset must always contain three numbers such that the product of two equals the third. 4. **Case Analyses:** Assume ( 2 in B_n ). - **Case 1:** ( 3 in B_n ) and ( 4 in B_n ) [ 6 = 2 cdot 3 in C_n, quad 8 = 2^3 in C_n, quad 12 = 2^2 cdot 3 in C_n ] To avoid a contradiction in ( C_n ), we need ( 48 = 2^4 cdot 3 in B_n ) and ( 96 = 2^5 times 3 in B_n ): [ Rightarrow 96 in B_n, quad text{which is a contradiction as } 96 = 2 cdot 48 ] - **Case 2:** ( 3 in B_n ) and ( 4 in C_n ) [ 6 = 2 cdot 3 in C_n, quad 24 = 2^3 cdot 3 in B_n, quad 8 = 2^3 in C_n, quad 12 = 2^2 cdot 3 in C_n, quad 48 = 2^4 cdot 3 in C_n ] This subset configuration leads to (48 in C_n) creating: [ 48 = 6 cdot 8, text{ which is a contradiction} ] - **Case 3:** ( 3 in C_n ) and ( 4 in B_n ) [ 8 = 2^3 in C_n, quad 24 = 2^3 cdot 3 in B_n, quad 6 = 2 cdot 3 in C_n, quad 48 = 2^4 cdot 3 in C_n ] This configuration leads to: [ 48 = 6 cdot 8, text{ which is a contradiction} ] - **Case 4:** ( 3 in C_n ) and ( 4 in C_n ) [ 12 = 2^2 cdot 3 in B_n, quad 6 = 2 cdot 3 in C_n, quad 24 = 2^3 cdot 3 in B_n ] This leads to: [ 24 = 4 cdot 6, text{ which is a contradiction} ] 5. **Conclusion:** Based on the exhaustive cases and observations, if ( n geq 96 ), it is impossible to avoid having all subsets free of such triplet products.

It turns out that the sum of these seven numbers does not depend on the initial choice of the four angles. Prove that this heptagon has four equal angles.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to show that in a convex 7-gon, there exist four angles that are equal. Additionally, it is given that if we choose any four angles, compute their sines, and any three remaining angles, compute their cosines, the sum of these values remains constant regardless of the choice. 2. **Setting Up the Sum**: Consider one possible sum as described. Let’s choose four angles of the 7-gon and compute their sines, and calculate the cosines of the other three angles. 3. **Rearranging the Arguments**: Let's look at swapping the arguments of one sine and one cosine. We denote these arguments by alpha and beta respectively. The change in sum due to swapping sin alpha and cos beta with sin beta and cos alpha is given by: [ (sin beta + cos alpha) - (sin alpha + cos beta) ] 4. **Using Angle Addition Formulas**: We use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to rewrite the expression: [ (sin beta + cos alpha) - (sin alpha + cos beta) = sqrt{2} (sin(beta - pi/4) - sin(alpha - pi/4)) ] 5. **Considering Sums Independence**: Since the sum is independent of the initial choice of angles, it follows that: [ sin (alpha - pi/4) = sin (beta - pi/4) ] 6. **Solving Trigonometric Equality**: Due to the periodic nature of sine function, within the interval ( (0, pi) ), this equality can happen either if: [ alpha - pi/4 = beta - pi/4 quad text{or} quad alpha - pi/4 = pi - (beta - pi/4) ] Which simplifies to: [ beta = alpha quad text{or} quad beta = 2pi - alpha ] However, since (alpha) and (beta) are angles of the 7-gon, the second case typically simplifies further based on the restrictions of the polygon’s angle sum and periodicity of trigonometric functions. 7. **Limiting the Number of Distinct Angles**: Since the 7-gon's sine of each angle with (pi/4) subtracted must produce the same value (a requirement for the sum to be invariant), the above results imply that there can be at most two distinct types of angles in the 7-gon. 8. **Confirming Equal Angles**: Given that there are 7 angles and at most two distinct values, by the pigeonhole principle, at least four of those seven angles must have the same value. # Conclusion Thus, in any convex 7-gon, there will be at least four angles that are equal.

What is the largest number of elements S can have?","completion":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps, closely following the logic provided in the standard solution. **Step 1: Analyzing a Smaller Set** First, we consider a smaller subset of numbers, {1, 2, ldots, 11}, to understand the constraints better. We aim to select numbers such that no two selected numbers have a difference of 4 or 7. - Choosing 1 as the smallest number immediately rules out the possibility of choosing 5 and 8 due to the difference constraints. - This leaves us with potential pairs of numbers where we can only choose one from each to avoid violating the difference constraints: [2,9], [3,7], [4,11], and [6,10]. From this analysis, it's clear that we can select at most 5 numbers from any set of 11 consecutive numbers without violating the difference constraints. **Step 2: Applying the Logic to the Larger Set** Given the total set is {1,2,3,ldots,1989}, we notice that 1989 can be expressed in terms of 11 as 1989 = 180cdot 11 + 9. This indicates that we can divide the set into groups of 11 numbers, with a remainder of 9 numbers at the end. However, to ensure we're working with complete groups of 11, we consider the last complete group to end at 1969 = 180cdot11 - 11 = 179cdot11. This allows us to divide the numbers from 1 to 1969 into 179 groups of 11. **Step 3: Maximizing the Selection** - For each group of 11, we've already determined we can select at most 5 numbers without violating the difference constraints. - For the final set of numbers beyond 1969, specifically {1970, 1971, ldots, 1989}, we look at a similar but smaller scenario for maximization. By examining {1, 2, ldots, 20} as a proxy, we realize we can select 10 numbers by choosing 5 from the first 11 and 5 from the next 9 (considering the pattern repeats every 11 numbers). **Step 4: Calculating the Maximum Number of Elements** - For the 179 groups of 11, we can select 179 cdot 5 numbers. - For the final segment of numbers, we can select an additional 10 numbers based on the pattern observed.

If ( a_{ij} = -1 ), changing it to ( 1 ) will affect the parities of the ( i )-th row and ( j )-th column. - Specifically, if a row or column has an odd number of ( -1 )'s, then changing one ( -1 ) to ( 1 ) affects the count as follows: - The row or column changes from having an odd number of ( -1 )'s to having an even number and vice versa. 3. **Impact on Total Odd Parity Rows and Columns:** - When a ( -1 ) is changed to ( 1 ), the total number of rows and columns with an odd number of ( -1 )’s can either: - Decrease by 2 (if both the row and column initially had an odd number of ( -1 )'s), - Increase by 2 (if both the row and column initially had an even number of ( -1 )'s), - Remain the same (if one is even and the other is odd). 4. **Invariant Property:** - Since each change affects the total number of rows and columns with an odd number of ( -1 )'s by ( pm 2 ) or by ( 0 ), the parity (odd or even nature) of this total number stays constant. - Thus, if initially, the total was even, it will remain even after any number of changes. 5. **Analysis of Initial Configuration:** - Consider we start with all elements being ( -1). Initially, every row and every column contains an odd number of ( -1 )'s. - This means there are ( n ) rows and ( n ) columns with an odd number of ( -1 )'s, giving a starting total of ( 2n ). 6. **Conclusion on Odd Total:** - Since changing any ( -1 ) to ( 1 ) maintains the parity (affecting by ( pm 2 ) or by ( 0 )), the total number of rows and columns with an odd number of ( -1 )'s must always be even. - Therefore, it is impossible for this total to equal ( n ) (an odd number), as ( n ) is odd by the problem's stipulation.

Detailed Solution: Let's consider that the pentagon (ABCDE) is already constructed and its sides (AB, BC, CD, DE,) and (EA) have midpoints denoted as (F, G, H, J,) and (K) respectively. 1. **Understanding a simpler case:** - For a triangle, if the midpoints of its sides are known, the original triangle can be uniquely reconstructed. This way, side lines through each midpoint parallel to the respective other two sides will intersect at the vertices of the triangle. - For a quadrilateral, the midpoints of its sides form a parallelogram. 2. **Approach for the polygon:** - To generalize this concept for a pentagon, we can divide the pentagon into simpler regions: - Consider the diagonal (AD) that splits the pentagon into a quadrilateral (ABCD) and a triangle (ADE). 3. **Constructing the parallelogram for (ABCD):** - Identify the midpoints (F, G, H) which correspond to the sides of quadrilateral (ABCD). - Extend these midpoints (F, G, H) into a parallelogram (FGHL) to determine midpoint (L), the midpoint of the diagonal (AD). 4. **Constructing the triangle (ADE):** - Knowing (J, K), and now (L) from the previous step, reconstruct the triangle (ADE). - This provides three consecutive vertices of the pentagon: (A, D, E). 5. **Finding the remaining vertices (B) and (C):** - From the midpoint properties, either use: - Reflection: (B) is the reflection of (A) about (F) and (C) is the reflection of (D) about (H). - Parallel lines: Construct lines parallel to relevant sides to find points of intersection, ensuring the sides meet at correct angles. 6. **Ensuring the construction is unique:** - The ordering of the midpoints (F, G, H, J, K) must be maintained for the unique construction. - Ensure none of the midpoints (F, G, H) lie on the same straight line; similarly, ensure the constructed parallelogram points and triangle vertices do not lie on one line. # Complexity and Convexity: - **Convexity criteria:** - The convexity of the pentagon requires additional conditions such as the arranged order of midpoints (FGHJK) and ensuring the interior vertices lie on the correct side. # Triangle method: If we implement this approach by constructing triangle vertices using known directions, proceed as follows: 1. **Construct triangle (ACD) using a starting point (A'):** - Using given midpoints \`directions\` from intersections and known sides relations, ensure consistency in angle and side ratios. - Adjust the positioning of triangle vertices to align with the required midpoints. # Reflection Method: 1. **Using the reflection principles:** - Reflect sequence of points successively through known midpoints. - Verify that reflecting through all midpoints returns to the initial point, verifying a closed polygon.

Analyzing the sign of the derivative f'(x) gives the following: - For x < 1, we have f'(x) > 0, thus f(x) is increasing. - For x = 1, we have f'(x) = 0. - For x > 1, we have f'(x) < 0, thus f(x) is decreasing. Hence, the function f(x) is increasing on the interval (-infty, 1) and decreasing on the interval (1, +infty). (Ⅱ) Since it is given that for b > a > 0, the inequality frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} > 1 always holds, let's consider h(x) = f(x) - x. This function should be increasing on the interval (0, +infty).

The derivative of k(x) is k'(x) = frac{-xe^x + 2e^x}{e^{2x}} = frac{2 - x}{e^x}. Setting k'(x) = 0 gives us x = 2 as a critical point. Examining k'(x): - For x in (0,2), we have k'(x) < 0, indicating that k(x) is decreasing. - For x in (2, +infty), we have k'(x) > 0, indicating that k(x) is increasing.

The key to solving it is to first determine that there are (45 - x) boys based on the problem, and then list the relationship equation according to the fact that the total donation equals the sum of the girls' donations and the boys' donations. Here is the step-by-step solution: 1. Let's denote the number of girls as x and the total donation as y. 2. Since there are 45 students in total, the number of boys can be represented as 45 - x. 3. The total donation y comes from the girls' donations and the boys' donations. Each girl donates 20 yuan, so the total donation from girls is 20x. Each boy donates 25 yuan, so the total donation from boys is 25(45 - x). 4. Therefore, the relationship between y and x can be represented as: y = 20x + 25(45 - x).

This is true because the distance between two parallel lines is constant along their lengths, and any segment perpendicular to one of the lines and ending on the other will have the same length. Therefore, B is correctly identified as correct in the solution. - **Statement C**: It describes the distance from a point outside a line to the line as the point's distance to the line.

Therefore, the points A, B, C, D, C', D' lie on the same conic Gamma with center M. Consequently, M is on Gamma. Let point O be the intersection of the lines AB and CD. The point O serves as the center of the degenerate conic consisting of the pair of lines AB and CD. Hence, O in Gamma. To provide a more detailed explanation, we start by identifying the pairs of segments and their midpoints: 1. Consider the segments (AB), (AC), (AD), (BC), (BD), and (CD). 2. Their midpoints divide these segments into equal parts. 3. If Gamma is a special type of conic (Nine-Point Circle for triangles), Gamma passes through these midpoints. For the points of intersection of lines connecting pairs of points: 1. The triangles formed by points A, B, C, D have nine such points of intersection within their medians, altitudes, and perpendicular bisectors intersecting at their orthocenter (if considering Nine-Point Circle for an illustration). Conclusion: Since O and the midpoints lie on conic Gamma, Gamma passes through six midpoints and three points of intersection from the specified lines. **b)** The midpoints of the sides of the quadrilateral ABCD form a parallelogram. The center of this parallelogram coincides with the centroid (center of mass) of the points A, B, C, D. This parallelogram can be inscribed in the conic Gamma, hence its center coincides with the center of Gamma. To describe this more rigorously: 1. The midpoints of the segments (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) form a parallelogram. 2. The centroid of this parallelogram is calculated using the centroid formula for a quadrilateral. Conclusion: From the properties of parallel sides in a parallelogram and the centroid calculation, the center of mass coincides with the conic center. **c)** If D is the orthocenter of triangle ABC, then Gamma is the Nine-Point Circle of this triangle. Proof by Nine-Point Circle properties: 1. The Nine-Point Circle is defined as passing through various significant points: the midpoints of each side of the triangle, the feet of each altitude, and the midpoint of the segment joining each vertex to the orthocenter of the triangle. 2. Thus, Gamma as a Nine-Point Circle includes these points by definition. Conclusion: The properties of the Nine-Point Circle dictate that if D is the orthocenter, Gamma is indeed the Nine-Point Circle for Delta ABC. **d)** If quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic, Gamma is a hyperbola with perpendicular asymptotes. In this case, the axes of all conics in the bundle are parallel to the asymptotes of Gamma. Using conic section properties: 1. A cyclic quadrilateral has opposite angles summing to 180^circ and can be inscribed in a circle. 2. The general conic equation can be transformed, and by such transformations in projective geometry, every conic in such a bundle (family of conics sharing the same points) shows that hyperbolas will have axes aligning with asymptotes appropriately. Conclusion: Given the cyclic nature of ABCD, and the transformation properties, the hyperbola Gamma has perpendicular asymptotes with conics sharing parallel properties corresponding to the asymptotes.

These ratios remain constant even when the liquid level rises. Final Scenario When the marble is dropped into each cone, the liquid level rises. The volume of each marble is ( frac{4}{3}pi(2)^3 = frac{32}{3}pi ). Let the new heights of the liquid be ( h_1' ) and ( h_2' ) for the narrower and wider cones, respectively. The new base radii will be ( 4x ) and ( 8y ) due to similar triangles, where ( x ) and ( y ) are scaling factors for the radii. The new heights will be ( h_1x ) and ( h_2y ).

Ratio of the Rise of the Liquid Level The rise in the liquid level for the narrower cone is ( h_1x - h_1 ) and for the wider cone is ( h_2y - h_2 ). Since ( x = y ), the ratio of the rises is: [ frac{h_1x - h_1}{h_2y - h_2} = frac{h_1(x-1)}{h_2(y-1)} = frac{h_1}{h_2} cdot frac{x-1}{y-1} ] Given ( h_1 = 4h_2 ) and ( x = y ), the ratio simplifies to: [ frac{4(x-1)}{x-1} = 4 ] Thus, the ratio of the rise of the liquid level in the narrower cone to the rise of the liquid level in the wider cone is (4:1).

The same holds true for BD and PQ—PQ is parallel and half as long as BD. The key aspect here is that the angle between AC and BD is the same as the angle between PR and PQ.

If we have already chosen t_{1} through t_{k}, and if t_{1}+t_{2}+ldots+t_{k} is still less than frac{a}{b}, then let t_{k+1} be the largest unit fraction less than both t_{k} and frac{a}{b}. Step 3. If t_{1}+ldots+t_{k+1} equals frac{a}{b}, the decomposition is found. Otherwise, repeat step 2. Why does this method never result in an infinite sequence of t_{i}?","completion":"1. Let frac{a}{b} be any positive rational number. We aim to show that the method for its decomposition into a sum of unit fractions will terminate. Define frac{a_k}{b_k} = frac{a}{b} - t_1 - t_2 - ldots - t_k, where frac{a_k}{b_k} is a fraction in its simplest terms after k steps. 2. Initially, we start with frac{a}{b} and choose t_1 = frac{1}{n_1}, where n_1 leq b/a. Subsequent terms t_2, t_3, ldots are chosen to be the largest unit fractions less than the remaining fraction each step. 3. The crucial observation is that each chosen unit fraction t_{k+1} reduces the remaining fraction frac{a_{k+1}}{b_{k+1}}. Specifically, if at some step we have t_k = frac{1}{n_k}, then frac{1}{n_k} > frac{a_k}{b_k} > frac{1}{n_k + 1}. This ensures frac{a_k}{b_k} < frac{1}{k+1} eventually. 4. Given that each term t_{k+1} is the largest unit fraction less than both t_k and frac{a_k}{b_k}, the remaining fraction always decreases. Suppose frac{1}{n_k+1} = t_{k+1}. Then we have frac{a_{k+1}}{b_{k+1}} = frac{a_k}{b_k} - frac{1}{n_k+1}, which is smaller than frac{1}{n_k cdot (n_k + 1)}. 5. Since both n_k and n_{k+1} tend to grow larger, the terms of the sequence left{frac{a_k}{b_k}right} form a strictly decreasing sequence of positive rational numbers. 6. Using the pigeonhole principle and the fact that left{frac{a_k}{b_k}right} are all rational numbers in simplest terms, the numerators a_k must eventually hit zero. At the point where a_{k+1} = 0, the remaining fraction frac{a_k}{b_k} becomes zero. 7.

The area of the plot including the path is ( (110 + 2 times 2.5) times (w + 2 times 2.5) ) square meters, because the path is 2.5 meters wide on all sides.

Let's derive a step-by-step solution based on the given constraints and conditions. 1. **Understanding the Composite Shape (Hook Shape):** First, consider the hook shape as a configuration of 6 unit squares. These hook shapes must be arranged in such a way that they completely cover a given ( m times n ) rectangle. The solution outlines various conditions under which this covering is possible. 2. **General Conditions for Coverage:** The main condition given is that the product of ( m ) and ( n ) must be divisible by 12: [ 12 mid mn ] 3. **Derived Conditions:** According to the solution, if ( 12 mid mn ), this can occur under several specific instances: [ 3 mid m text{ and } 4 mid n, quad text{or} quad 3 mid n text{ and } 4 mid m, quad text{or} quad 12 mid m text{ and } n neq 1,2,5, quad text{or} quad 12 mid n text{ and } m neq 1,2,5 ] 4. **Divisibility Conditions:** The solution explains the necessity of at least one dimension being divisible by 4 and another by 3. This ensures that the entire grid can be grouped into ( 3 times 4 ) or ( 4 times 3 ) blocks. 5. **Case Analysis for Coverage:** - **Case 1: ( 3 mid m text{ and } 4 mid n ):** [ m times n = (3a) times (4b) ] Since ( m ) is divisible by 3 and ( n ) by 4, we can partition the whole grid into ( 3 times 4 ) subgrids, and each subgrid can be covered by exactly one hook shape. - **Case 2: ( 3 mid n text{ and } 4 mid m ):** [ m times n = (4a) times (3b) ] Similarly, the grid can be divided into ( 4 times 3 ) subgrids, ensuring complete coverage with hook shapes. - **Case 3: ( 12 mid m text{ and } n neq 1,2,5 ):** If ( m ) is divisible by 12, any dimension ( n neq 1,2,5 ) will work because we can still partition the grid into full-covered blocks. - **Case 4: ( 12 mid n text{ and } m neq 1,2,5 ):** Similarly, if ( n ) is divisible by 12, then ( m neq 1,2,5 ) is sufficient to guarantee coverage. 6. **Proof by Contradiction for Restrictions:** Using the given configurations, let’s prove that both dimensions cannot be 1, 2, or 5: Assume ( m ) and ( n ) are both non-divisible by 4. Consider grid coloring with numbers corresponding to divisibility by 4. Sum within a ( 3 times 4 ) block is inconsistent, leading to contradiction since ( mn ) is even. Thus ensuring ( 12 mid mn ) and avoiding trivial exceptions. 7. **Conclusion:** From the provided cases and conditions: [ boxed{text{Any ( m times n ) rectangle can be covered by hook shapes if it meets one of the derived conditions: 3 | m and 4 | n, or 3 | n and 4 | m, or 12 | m and n ≠ {1,2,5}, or 12 | n and m ≠ {1,2,5}.}} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the 415th digit to the right of the decimal point when frac{15}{41} is expressed as a decimal?","completion":"First, we need to find the decimal representation of frac{15}{41}.

After bringing down a zero, 150 divided by 41 is approximately 3 (as 3 times 41 = 123). Subtracting 123 from 150 gives 27. Bring down another zero to get 270. 270 divided by 41 is approximately 6 (as 6 times 41 = 246). Subtracting 246 from 270 gives 24.

Initially, all vertices are +1-vertices since all edges are labeled +1. 2. **Transforming Vertices from +1 to -1:** - We need to find a method that, provided there are at least two +1-vertices, converts exactly two +1-vertices into -1-vertices by changing the signs of some edges. 3. **Finding a Path Between +1-Vertices:** - Choose any two +1-vertices in the polyhedron, denoted as ( P ) and ( Q ). - Since the polyhedron is convex, there exists a path ( T ) consisting of edges (a broken line) connecting ( P ) and ( Q ). - Ensure that this path ( T ) does not revisit any vertex. If ( T ) revisits a vertex, it can be shortened by removing loops until no vertex is revisited. 4. **Flipping Edge Signs:** - Change the sign of each edge in path ( T ). - After flipping, the product of edge labels incident to ( P ) and ( Q ) changes from ( (+1)^{text{degree}(P)} = +1 ) to ((-1)^{text{degree}(P)} = -1) and similarly for ( Q ). - For any other vertex on path ( T ), the product of the incoming edge labels remains +1 since each has two incident edges on ( T ). 5. **Iterating the Process:** - Repeat this process 50 times. Each iteration converts two +1-vertices to -1-vertices. - After 50 iterations, the sequence of -1-vertices will follow: (2, 4, 6, ldots, 100). - Thus, in the end, every vertex becomes a -1-vertex. 6. **Generalization and Conclusion:** - This process shows that we can eventually get all vertices to be -1-vertices by appropriate edge sign changes. - This method can be extended to any even-numbered set of vertices. - The essential condition used here from the polyhedron being convex is its connectedness, allowing any two vertices to be connected by a path of edges. Hence, the edges of a 100-vertex convex polyhedron can indeed be labeled with +1 and -1 such that the product of the numbers on the edges incident to each vertex is -1.

The given reference solution indicates that it is not true, meaning not all natural numbers from 1 to 100 will be printed. Below are the reasoning steps to reach this conclusion: First Method: 1. **Observation of Non-Divisibility by 7**: - If an even number ( n ) is not divisible by 7, then ( frac{n}{2} ) is also not divisible by 7. - If an odd number ( n ) is not divisible by 7, then ( n + 1001 ), being odd, also does not become divisible by 7 after adding 1001 (since 1001 is divisible by 7 and the sum of a non-divisible number and a divisible number remains non-divisible). Therefore, ( frac{n + 1001}{2} ) is also not divisible by 7. Thus, any number that is not divisible by 7 will continue to not produce numbers divisible by 7 under these transformations. 2. **Initial Condition**: - The initial number 1 is not divisible by 7. - Hence, none of the subsequent numbers generated using the given rules will be divisible by 7. 3. **Conclusion**: - Since there will never be any number divisible by 7 among the printed numbers, the numbers 7, 14, 21, ..., 98 (all multiples of 7 up to 100) will never be printed. - Therefore, not all natural numbers from 1 to 100 will appear. Second Method: 1. **Cycle Repetition Check**: - Carry out the first few steps of the number generation process to notice a potential repetition. - For the initial number 1: [ n_0 = 1 ] [ n_1 = frac{1 + 1001}{2} = 501 ] [ n_2 = frac{501 + 1001}{2} = 751 ] [ n_3 = frac{751 + 1001}{2} = 876 ] [ n_4 = frac{876}{2} = 438 ] [ n_5 = frac{438}{2} = 219 ] [ n_6 = frac{219 + 1001}{2} = 610 ] [ n_7 = frac{610}{2} = 305 ] And continue this way... 2. **Finding the Cycle**: - By systematically calculating and checking each step, determine that the numbers will cycle back to 1 after approximately 60 steps. - Once a cycle is established, further numbers will repeat the same cycle without producing new distinct numbers. 3. **Conclusion**: - If a number cycle repeats without covering all numbers from 1 to 100, this implies that not all of these numbers will be printed. - As deduced by the detailed steps (forming a cycle by 61st number), the printed sequence does not cover all numbers up to 100. # Final Conclusion: As comprehensively analyzed through both methods, it can be concluded that not all natural numbers from 1 to 100 will ever be printed by Wall-E.

This is because any polynomial with real coefficients can be factored into real linear factors and irreducible quadratic factors (which correspond to pairs of complex conjugate roots). 2. **Scaling and Simplification:** Without loss of generality, we can consider a quadratic polynomial ( Q(x) = x^2 + ax + b ) where ( a^2 > 4b ). This ensures that the roots of ( Q(x) ) are non-real, as the discriminant ( a^2 - 4b ) is positive. 3. **Polynomial Multiplication:** We need to show that there exists a positive integer ( n ) such that the polynomial ( (1 + x)^n cdot Q(x) ) has nonnegative coefficients. Consider the expansion: [ (1 + x)^n cdot (x^2 + ax + b) ] Expanding ( (1 + x)^n ) using the binomial theorem, we get: [ (1 + x)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^k ] Therefore, [ (1 + x)^n cdot (x^2 + ax + b) = left( sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} x^k right) cdot (x^2 + ax + b) ] 4. **Coefficient Calculation:** We need to ensure that the coefficients of the resulting polynomial are nonnegative.

Consider the expression: [ binom{n}{k-2} + a binom{n}{k-1} + b binom{n}{k} ] For large ( n ), the binomial coefficients grow, and we can ensure that the sum is nonnegative by choosing ( n ) large enough. Specifically, the term ( binom{n}{k-2} ) will dominate for large ( n ), ensuring the nonnegativity of the coefficients. 6. **Edge Cases:** - The coefficient of ( x^{n+2} ) is 1. - The coefficient of ( x^{n+1} ) is ( n + a ), which can be made positive by choosing ( n ) sufficiently large. - The constant term is ( b ), which is positive. - The coefficient of ( x ) is ( bn + a ), which can also be made positive by choosing ( n ) sufficiently large.

The smallest multiple of 33 that is greater than or equal to 1300 is 1320 (which is 33 * 40). So, H = 40. Now we can find D using equation (5): D = (33/104) * 40 D = (33/104) * (104/33) * 40 D = 40 Since D is the number of flocks of ducks and each flock has 13 ducks, the smallest number of ducks Morris could have observed is: 13 * 40 = boxed{520} ducks."},{"prompt":"f the function f(x)=ln x+ax^{2}2 has a monotonically increasing interval in the interval ({frac{1}{4},1}), then the range of real number a is () A: (infty ,2) B: (8,+infty ) C: (2,+infty ) D: ({frac{1}{8}，+∞})","completion":"To determine the range of the real number a for which the function f(x)=ln x+ax^{2}-2 has a monotonically increasing interval in the interval left(frac{1}{4},1right), we first find the derivative of f(x): 1.

Therefore, numbers that are congruent to 2 pmod 4 cannot be expressed as the difference of squares of two nonnegative integers. # Conclusion Summing up the numbers that can be expressed as the difference of squares (500 odd numbers and 250 multiples of 4), we get: [ 500 + 250 = 750 ] Therefore, the number of integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, that can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers is boxed{750}."},{"prompt":"A coat is originally priced at 50.

Note that (B, C, M, N) are concyclic (i.e., lie on a common circle). This can be deduced from the cyclic quadrilateral properties because the angles (angle BMH) and (angle CNH) are both right angles. 5. Due to the properties of a cyclic quadrilateral, we apply the power of a point theorem at (H). This gives: [ HB cdot HM = HC cdot HN ] This is because power of a point theorem states for a point (P) outside a circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths of two intersecting secants drawn from the point. 6.

Given the eccentricity e = dfrac{c}{a} = dfrac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we get a^2 = 2c^2 = 2a^2 - 2b^2, solving this gives a = sqrt{2}. Therefore, the equation of the ellipse C is dfrac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1.

Let the line AN be y - y_1 = dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{x_1 - x_2}(x - x_1). Since A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2) satisfy the line l: y = k(x - 2), We have y = dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{x_1 - x_2}x - dfrac{x_2y_1 + x_1y_2}{x_1 - x_2} = dfrac{k}{x_1 - x_2}[(x_1 + x_2 - 4)x - 2(x_1x_2 - (x_1 + x_2))] = -dfrac{4k}{(x_1 - x_2)(1 + 2k^2)}(x - 1), Therefore, the line l passes through the fixed point (1,0).

Since frac{1}{2} is less than 1, the log base frac{1}{2} is a decreasing function. Therefore, a greater value on the right side of the inequality leads to an interval going from a smaller number towards a larger number for x-1. We can rewrite it as: frac{1}{2}^{-1} < x-1 This simplifies to: 2 < x-1 x > 3 But we also must consider the domain of the logarithm, which means x-1 must be positive, hence x > 1.

A: 1 B: 2 C: 4 D: 8","completion":"Let's analyze the geometry of the hyperbola and the parabola mentioned in the problem. We can find the focus of the parabola y^2 = 8x is at (2,0), and by using the length |AB| = 2sqrt{3}, we should be able to deduce the required property of the hyperbola. Now proceeding to the solution: Let the standard equation of the hyperbola be frac{x^2}{lambda} - frac{y^2}{lambda} = 1 (since the center is at the origin and it is symmetric about the x-axis), where lambda > 0. The parabola y^2 = 8x has its focus at (2,0). We are given that the length of the segment AB, which represents the distance between the points of intersection of the hyperbola and the directrix of the parabola, is 2sqrt{3}. 1. The equation of the directrix of the parabola y^2 = 8x is x = -2 (since the focus is at (2,0), and the directrix is the same distance but on the opposite side from the vertex which is at the origin). 2. Thus, points A and B lie on the line x = -2 and also satisfy the hyperbola equation. We substitute x = -2 into the hyperbola equation to get the y-coordinates of A and B: frac{(-2)^2}{lambda} - frac{y^2}{lambda} = 1 Rightarrow frac{4}{lambda} - frac{y^2}{lambda} = 1 Rightarrow frac{y^2}{lambda} = frac{4}{lambda} - 1 3. We use the given distance |AB|=2sqrt{3} to find the corresponding y-values. Since the points A and B are symmetric about the x-axis, the difference in their y-coordinates is 2sqrt{3}: y_B - y_A = 2sqrt{3} 4. Solving for y^2 from the equation frac{y^2}{lambda} = frac{4}{lambda} - 1 gives y^2 = 4 - lambda 5. Knowing that y_B - y_A equates to 2sqrt{y^2} = 2sqrt{3}, we square both sides to remove the square root and solve for lambda: (2sqrt{3})^2 = 4cdot(4-lambda) This simplifies to 12 = 16 - 4lambda, so 4lambda = 4 and lambda = 1. 6. With lambda = 1, the equation of the hyperbola is now x^2 - y^2 = 1, which means the real axis is twice the value of lambda, that is, 2lambda = 2 times 1 = 2. Therefore, the length of the real axis of the hyperbola C is boxed{2}."},{"prompt":"Define the sequence ({a_n}) by (a_1 in (0, 1)), and (a_{n+1} = a_n (1 a_n)). Show that (lim_{n to infty} n a_n = 1).","completion":"We aim to prove that (lim_{n to infty} n a_n = 1) for the sequence ({a_n}) defined by (a_1 in (0, 1)) and (a_{n+1} = a_n(1 - a_n)). 1. **Initial Step — Establishing an Upper Bound**: - First, we show that (a_n < frac{1}{n+1}) for all (n > 1). 2. **Base Case**: - For (n = 1), [ a_2 = a_1(1 - a_1) = frac{1}{4} - (a_1 - frac{1}{2})^2 < frac{1}{3} ] - This inequality holds because (frac{1}{4} - (a_1 - frac{1}{2})^2) reaches its maximum value, (frac{1}{4}), when (a_1 = frac{1}{2}), but since (a_1) is in ((0, 1)), (frac{1}{3}) is clearly an upper bound. 3. **Inductive Step**: - Assume (a_n < frac{1}{n+1}). - Consider (a_{n+1} = a_n(1 - a_n)). - If (a_n < frac{1}{n+1}), then: [ a_{n+1} < left(1 - frac{1}{n+1}right) frac{1}{n+1} = frac{n}{(n+1)^2} ] - Because (frac{n}{(n+1)^2} < frac{1}{n+2}): [ frac{n}{(n+1)^2} = frac{n}{n^2 + 2n + 1} < frac{n} {n^2 + 2n} = frac{1}{n+2} ] - Therefore, (a_{n+1} < frac{1}{n+2}), completing the inductive step. Thus, by induction, (a_n < frac{1}{n+1}) for all (n). 4. **Establishing a Lower Bound**: - Suppose (a_n > frac{1}{k + sqrt{k}}). - Consider: [ a_{n+1} = a_n(1 - a_n) > left(frac{1}{k + sqrt{k}}right) left(1 - frac{1}{k + sqrt{k}}right) ] - We show that this is larger than (frac{1}{k+1 + sqrt{k+1}}) for sufficiently large (k): [ frac{1}{k + sqrt{k}} left(1 - frac{1}{k + sqrt{k}}right) = frac{1}{k + sqrt{k}} cdot frac{k + sqrt{k} - 1}{k + sqrt{k}} ] - Simplifying, we get: [ frac{k + sqrt{k} - 1}{(k + sqrt{k})^2} ] 5. **Comparison of Quantities**: - We need to demonstrate that: [ frac{k + sqrt{k} - 1} {k^2 + 2k sqrt{k} + k} geq frac{1}{k + 1 + sqrt{k+1}} ] - We observe: [ 1 leq frac{sqrt{k+1} - sqrt{k}}{sqrt{k+1}} text{ when } k > 11 ] - Since (sqrt{k + 1} > sqrt{k} + frac{1}{3sqrt{k}}) and ((k - 1) > 3sqrt{k} ) holds for (k > 11), this indicates (a_n > frac{1}{(k + sqrt{k})}) for large (k). 6. **Conclusion by Squeezing**: - Now, if (a_1 > 0), there exists some sufficiently large (k) such that (a_n > frac{1}{(k + sqrt{k})}). - Thus, for all (n), using the sequence: [ frac{n}{n + k + sqrt{n + k}} < n a_n < frac{n}{n+1} ] - As (n rightarrow infty), both bounds, (frac{n}{n+k+sqrt{n+k}}) and (frac{n}{n+1}), converge to (1).

Speed in meters per second (m/s) = Speed in kilometers per hour (km/h) × (1000 meters / 1 kilometer) × (1 hour / 3600 seconds) Speed in m/s = 65 km/h × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 h / 3600 s) Speed in m/s = 65 × 1000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 65000 / 3600 Speed in m/s = 18.055555555555557 m/s (approximately) Now, we know the train takes 21.04615384615385 seconds to pass the bridge completely.

So, the distance at the reduced speed is: [ D = left(frac{5}{6}Sright) times left(T + frac{1}{10}right) ] Since the distance ( D ) remains the same, we can set the two equations equal to each other: [ S times T = left(frac{5}{6}Sright) times left(T + frac{1}{10}right) ] Now, we can solve for ( T ): [ S times T = frac{5}{6}S times T + frac{5}{6}S times frac{1}{10} ] Divide both sides by ( S ) to cancel out the speed (since it's not zero): [ T = frac{5}{6}T + frac{5}{60} ] Subtract ( frac{5}{6}T ) from both sides: [ frac{1}{6}T = frac{5}{60} ] Multiply both sides by 6 to solve for ( T ): [ T = frac{5}{60} times 6 ] [ T = frac{5}{10} ] [ T = frac{1}{2} ] So, the usual time ( T ) it takes for the cab to cover the journey is half an hour or boxed{30} minutes."},{"prompt":"Jane makes toy bears.

However, each assistant has a different efficiency, so we need to calculate the output with each assistant separately.

When A and B are the left and right vertices of the ellipse, we have A(-2,0) and B(2,0). The position vectors overrightarrow{AP}=(x_{P}+2,y_{P}) and overrightarrow{BP}=(x_{P}-2,y_{P}). For angle APB = 90^{circ}, we need overrightarrow{AP} cdot overrightarrow{BP} = 0, which results in x_{P}^{2}-4+y_{P}^{2}=0...(1). Since point P lies on the ellipse, frac{x_{P}^{2}}{4}+y_{P}^{2}=1. Substitute y_{P}^{2}=1-frac{x_{P}^{2}}{4} in equation (1) and solve for x_{P}, we get x_{P}= pm 2 and consequently y_{P}=0. Clearly, this contradicts the fact that P is a point on the ellipse distinct from A and B. Therefore, no such point P exists. (II) Let P(x_{P},y_{P}) and A(x_{A},y_{A}). According to the problem, line l_{1} passes through the origin, so B(-x_{A},-y_{A}). As P is a point on the ellipse distinct from A and B, the slopes of lines PA and PB are k_{1}=frac{y_{P}-y_{A}}{x_{P}-x_{A}} and k_{2}=frac{y_{P}+y_{A}}{x_{P}+x_{A}}, respectively. Thus, k_{1} cdot k_{2} = frac{y_{P}^{2}-y_{A}^{2}}{x_{P}^{2}-x_{A}^{2}}. The equation of ellipse W can be rewritten as x^{2}+4y^{2}=4. Since both points P and A lie on the ellipse, we have the following system: begin{cases} x_{P}^{2}+4y_{P}^{2}=4 x_{A}^{2}+4y_{A}^{2}=4 end{cases} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get x_{P}^{2}-x_{A}^{2}+4(y_{P}^{2}-y_{A}^{2})=0. Since points P and A are distinct, 1+4 cdot frac{y_{P}^{2}-y_{A}^{2}}{x_{P}^{2}-x_{A}^{2}}=0, which leads to k_{1} cdot k_{2} = frac{y_{P}^{2}-y_{A}^{2}}{x_{P}^{2}-x_{A}^{2}} = -frac{1}{4}. (III) First Method: Since lines l_{2} and l_{3} are parallel to lines PA and PB, respectively, the slopes of lines l_{2} and l_{3} are k_{CD}=k_{1} and k_{EF}=k_{2}. Let the equation of line l_{2} be y=k_{1}x. Substitute this in the ellipse equation, we get x^{2}+4k_{1}^{2}x^{2}=4, and solving for x^{2}, we have x^{2}=frac{4}{4k_{1}^{2}+1}. Let C(x_{C},y_{C}).

To simplify the problem, we introduce a new variable ( y_i = log_2 x_i ). This transformation helps us work with logarithms, which can simplify multiplicative relationships. 3. Substituting ( x_i = 2^{y_i} ) into the recurrence relation, we get: [ 2^{y_{i-1}} + frac{2}{2^{y_{i-1}}} = 2 cdot 2^{y_i} + frac{1}{2^{y_i}} ] Simplifying, we have: [ 2^{y_{i-1}} + 2^{1-y_{i-1}} = 2^{y_i+1} + 2^{-y_i} ] 4.

The possible outcomes for the first dice (an odd number) are: 1, 3, or 5. Now, let's consider each case: 1. If the first dice shows a 1, the second dice can show any number from 2 to 6 to get a sum greater than 2. That's 5 possible outcomes. 2. If the first dice shows a 3, the second dice can show any number from 1 to 6 to get a sum greater than 2. That's 6 possible outcomes. 3. If the first dice shows a 5, the second dice can also show any number from 1 to 6 to get a sum greater than 2. That's another 6 possible outcomes. So, the total number of favorable outcomes is 5 (from the first case) + 6 (from the second case) + 6 (from the third case) = 17. The total number of possible outcomes for the second dice, regardless of the sum, is 6 (since a die has 6 faces). Since we are given that the first dice roll was an odd number, we only consider the cases where the first dice is 1, 3, or 5. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes for the first dice is 3 (since there are three odd numbers on a die). The total number of possible outcomes for both dice, given the first is odd, is 3 (possible outcomes for the first dice) * 6 (possible outcomes for the second dice) = 18. Now, we can calculate the conditional probability: P(Sum > 2 | First dice is odd) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total possible outcomes P(Sum > 2 | First dice is odd) = 17 / 18 Therefore, the conditional probability of obtaining a sum greater than 2 given that the first dice roll was an odd number is boxed{17/18} ."},{"prompt":"The square root of a number divided by 11 equals a certain value.

This gives us a total of 4 outcomes. - Event A (both heads appear) corresponds to the outcome HH. - Event B (both tails appear) corresponds to the outcome TT. - The combination A+B represents either both heads or both tails appearing, which covers the outcomes HH and TT. - Since there are also outcomes HT and TH that do not fall under A+B, A+B does not cover all possible outcomes. Hence, A+B is not a certain event. 2. **Option B: AB is an impossible event.** - For AB to occur, both events A and B would have to happen simultaneously. This means both coins would have to show heads and tails at the same time, which is impossible. - Therefore, AB is indeed an impossible event. 3. **Option C: Events A and B are mutually exclusive.** - Events A and B being mutually exclusive means that if event A occurs, event B cannot occur, and vice versa. - Since event A corresponds to both coins showing heads and event B corresponds to both coins showing tails, it's clear that they cannot occur at the same time. - Therefore, events A and B are mutually exclusive. 4. **Option D: Events A and B are independent events.** - For events to be independent, the occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of the other. - However, in this case, if A occurs (both coins show heads), B cannot occur (both coins show tails), and vice versa.

Replacing ( ab ) by ( a ), we may assume ( (P(n), Q(n)) mid a ) for every ( n ). 2. **Apply Zsigmondy's theorem:** - By Zsigmondy's theorem, there exist infinitely many primes ( p_1, p_2, ldots ) such that there exists ( a_i in mathbb{N} ) with ( p_i mid 2^{Q(a_i)} - 1 ), hence ( p_i mid 3^{P(a_i)} - 1 ). For each ( 1 leq i leq n ), let ( d_i ) be the order of 3 modulo ( p_i ). 3. **Case I: There exist infinitely many primes ( q_1 < q_2 < ldots ) such that for every ( j ), ( q_j mid d_k ) for some ( k ).** - The sequence ( {d_n} ) is unbounded. Therefore, for all sufficiently large ( q )'s, we have ( (q, a) = 1 ). Suppose ( q mid d_i ). For every ( m in mathbb{Z}_{geq 0} ), we have ( Q(a_i) mid Q(a_i + mQ(a_i)) ). Therefore: [ p_i mid 2^{Q(a_i + mQ(a_i))} - 1 mid 3^{P(a_i + mQ(a_i))} - 1 ] Since ( d_i ) is the order, we must have: [ d_i mid P(a_i + mQ(a_i)) quad text{(1)} ] Notice that ( q mid d_i mid P(a_i) ). Therefore, ( (q, Q(a_i)) mid (P(a_i), Q(a_i)) mid a ). From ( (q, a) = 1 ), we have ( (q, Q(a_i)) = 1 ). Therefore, the arithmetic progression ( a_i + mQ(a_i) ) covers all residue classes mod ( q ), hence from (1) we have: [ q mid P(x) ] for every ( 1 leq x leq q ). For sufficiently large ( q ), this implies ( P ) is the zero polynomial in ( mathbb{F}_q ) (using the well-known fact that a nonzero polynomial with degree ( n ) in ( mathbb{F}_q ) has at most ( n ) roots). This is obviously a contradiction. 4. **Case II: There exist finitely many primes ( q ) with ( q mid d_k ) for some ( k ).** - Notice that ( {d_k} ) is obviously unbounded, therefore, there exists some prime ( q ) such that for all ( alpha in mathbb{N} ), ( q^{alpha} mid d_k ) for some ( k in mathbb{N} ). Similarly, we have: [ q^{alpha} mid P(a_k + mQ(a_k)) ] and: [ (q^{alpha}, Q(a_k)) mid (P(a_k), Q(a_k)) mid a ] Let ( c = (a, q^{alpha}) ). Pick ( alpha ) sufficiently large, by the pigeonhole principle there exists ( 0 leq i leq c - 1 ) such that: [ a_k + mQ(a_k) equiv i pmod{q^{alpha}} ] for some ( m in mathbb{N} ), hence: [ P(i) equiv 1 pmod{q^{alpha}} ] but this is clearly impossible for: [ alpha geq max_{1 leq j leq q^{v_q(a)}} v_p(P(j)) ] contradiction.

Sasha wrote a non-zero digit on the board and continues to append a non-zero digit to the right of the last number until there are exactly 1 million digits. Prove that no more than 100 perfect squares were written on the board. 1. Consider the sequences of perfect squares that occur on the board. We can distinguish between numbers with an odd and even number of digits. 2. Let ( x_1^2, x_2^2, ldots ) be the perfect squares with an even number of digits, where ( x_k^2 ) contains ( 2n_k ) digits ((n_1 < n_2 < cdots)). 3. Similarly, let ( y_1^2, y_2^2, ldots ) be the perfect squares with an odd number of digits, where ( y_k^2 ) contains ( 2m_k - 1 ) digits ((m_1 < m_2 < cdots)). 4. A number ( x_k^2 ) has ( 2n_k ) digits and does not end in 0. Therefore, we have: [ x_k^2 > 10^{2n_k-1} implies x_k > 10^{n_k-1} ] 5. The number ( x_{k+1}^2 ) is formed by appending an even number of non-zero digits (denoted as ( 2a )) to ( x_k ). Therefore, we can write: [ 10^{2a} x_k^2 < x_{k+1}^2 < 10^{2a} x_k^2 + 10^{2a} ] 6. From the left inequality, we get: [ 10^{a} x_k + 1 leq x_{k+1} implies 10^{2a} x_k^2 + 2 cdot 10^a x_k + 1 leq x_{k+1}^2 ] 7. Combining the inequalities, we have: [ 10^{2a} x_k^2 + 2 cdot 10^a x_k + 1 leq x_{k+1}^2 < 10^{2a} x_k^2 + 10^{2a} ] 8. This implies: [ 2 cdot 10^a x_k + 1 < 10^{2a} implies x_k < 10^a ] 9. Thus, ( x_k ) has at most ( a ) digits, meaning ( n_k leq a ). Following from this, we also have: [ 10^a x_k + 1 leq x_{k+1} implies a + n_k leq n_{k+1} ] 10. Therefore: [ 2n_k leq n_{k+1} ] 11. Similar arguments apply to the sequences ( y_k^2 ), where ( y_{k+1}^2 ) is formed by appending digits to ( y_k^2 ). This leads to: [ y_{k+1}^2 leq 2 y_k ] 12. This implies ( y_k < 10^a ) and ( a geq m_k ), so: [ m_{k+1} geq 2 m_k ] 13.

According to the rules: - From ((k, l)), one can move to ((k-t, l)), ((k, l-t)), or ((k-t, l-t)) for any ( t geq 1 ). Step 3: Formulate Wythoff Sequence To discern the winning and losing positions, we use two sequences: - The sequence of positions ((a_n, b_n)) where ( a_n = leftlfloor alpha n rightrfloor ) and ( b_n = leftlfloor beta n rightrfloor ). - Here (alpha = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}) (the golden ratio), and (beta = alpha + 1). Step 4: Calculate Specific Positions We calculate positions using ( alpha ) and ( beta ): - For ( n = 100 ): [ a_{100} = leftlfloor 100 times frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor 100 times 1.61803398 cdots rightrfloor = 161 ] [ b_{100} = leftlfloor 100 times left(frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} + 1right) rightrfloor = leftlfloor 100 times 2.61803398 cdots rightrfloor = 261 ] Step 5: Characteristics of Winning and Losing Positions From the sequences, the following characteristics are observed: 1. (a_0 = b_0 = 0). 2. (a_n) is the smallest natural number that hasn't appeared in any previous position. 3. (b_n = a_n + n). To prove: [ b_n - a_n = [n beta] - [n alpha] = leftlfloor n(1+alpha) rightrfloor - [n alpha] = [n+n alpha] - [n alpha] = n + [n alpha] - [n alpha] = n ] Step 6: Transforming Between Positions We derive transformations to show how configurations shift based on moves: - Any move from a (textit{winning}) position ((a_n, b_n)) must result in a (textit{losing}) position. - Conversely, any move from a (textit{losing}) position can convert it into a (textit{winning}) position. By the construction of the Wythoff sequences, every natural number ( k ) appears exactly once within the pairs ((a_n, b_n)). Step 7: Theorems and Proofs # Theorem 1: In the Wythoff game, any move from a losing position ((a_n, b_n)) will convert it into a winning position. - Suppose ((a_n, b_n)), the operation results in ((a_n - t, b_n)), then (b_n) appears twice in winning positions which isn't possible. - Similarly, for operations resulting in ((a_n, b_n - t)) and ((a_n - t, b_n - t)). # Theorem 2: For any given non-winning position ((m, m)). - ( t = m), and ((m - t, m - t) = (0, 0)) transitions it to a winning position. Conclusively, applying this logic iteratively: - If the initial position is non-winning, the first player wins. - If the initial position is winning, the second player wins. # Conclusion The Wythoff game's result is determined by whether the initial position is a winning or losing configuration.

Three cells on the board are marked, and the pairwise distances between them are all equal to 100.

Three cells on the chessboard are marked, and the pairwise distances between them are all equal to 100. How many cells exist from which the distance to all three marked cells is 50? 1. **Understanding King's Moves**: On an infinite chessboard, the king can move one step to any adjacent cell, including diagonals. Therefore, the distance rho(A, B) between two cells A and B with Cartesian coordinates (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) respectively, is given by: [ rho(A, B) = max{|x_1 - x_2|, |y_1 - y_2|} ] This formula captures the number of king's moves required to reach from one cell to another. 2. **Setting the Coordinates**: Let the marked cells be A, B, and C. Given that the distance between these pairs (i.e., rho(A, B), rho(B, C), and rho(A, C)) is 100, it implies that the maximum of the absolute differences in their coordinates is 100. 3. **Fixed Axis**: Given that the distance between B and C is 100: [ max{|x_B - x_C|, |y_B - y_C|} = 100 ] 4. **Assumptions and Constraints**: To simplify, assume without loss of generality that the cells’ x-coordinates differ. For instance, assume A and B differ along the x-axis by 100 units. Similarly, assume A and C also differ along the x-axis by 100 units: [ |x_A - x_B| = 100, quad |x_A - x_C| = 100 ] Hence, B and C must then differ along the y-axis, or else x_A would be equal in all three, contradicting 100 separation. Consequently, assume: [ |y_B - y_C| = 100, text{ with } x_B = x_C ] Summarizing, let: [ B(0, 0), C(0, 100), A(100, y) ] 5. **Finding Cell 50 moves from all marked cells**: Let X(x, y) be a cell such that its distance to A, B, and C is 50.

Each subsequent move is made perpendicular to the previous one: if the previous move was horizontal left or right, then the next one will be vertical up or down, and vice versa. What is the maximum number of turtles that can move indefinitely on the board such that at each moment no cell contains more than one turtle?","completion":"# Problem: In some cells of a rectangular board of size (101 times 99) each cell contains one turtle. Every minute, each turtle simultaneously crawls to one of the neighboring cells of the board in such a way that if the previous move was horizontal (left or right), the next move will be vertical (up or down), and vice versa. What is the maximum number of turtles that can move indefinitely on the board such that at any moment no more than one turtle is in any cell? The answer: 9800. Let's show how we can have examples of 9800 turtles moving indefinitely on the board: Example 1: 1. We place turtles in cells located at the intersection of the bottom 98 horizontal rows and the leftmost 100 vertical columns of the board. 2. The turtles will move as follows: first, all move to the right, then all move up, then all move to the left, and finally, all move down. After 4 moves, the situation matches the initial one, so the movement can be repeated indefinitely, allowing for unbounded movement in the specified manner. Example 2: 1. Start with the same initial placement of turtles as in Example 1. 2. Organize the movement by breaking them into smaller (2 times 2) grids. In each (2 times 2) grid, turtles will all move clockwise: first right, then down, then left, and then up. This results in a cycle where after 4 moves, each turtle will return to its starting position, allowing for indefinite repetition. Proving that more than 9800 turtles cannot be placed: Let's assume the contrary, that turtles are positioned on the board such that more than 9800 can move indefinitely without ending up in a situation where two turtles occupy the same cell. 1. **Color the cells of the board in a checkerboard pattern**: Assume the bottom left cell is black. This gives us 5000 black cells and 4999 white cells. - Name a cell **black odd** if both its row and column numbers are odd, and **black even** if both are even. - For **white cells**, one coordinate is even and the other is odd. 2. **Distribution of black cells**: There will be (51 times 50 = 2550) odd black cells and (50 times 49 = 2450) even black cells. 3. **Movement impact**: When a turtle moves, it changes the parity of both its coordinates. Thus: - After two moves, turtles on odd black cells move to even black cells and vice versa. - Turtles on white cells return to white cells. 4. **Invariant property**: In any given situation, the count of turtles on even black cells and on odd black cells cannot exceed 2450 and 2550 respectively. 5. **Bounding the number of turtles**: Consequently, the total number of turtles on black cells is always less than or equal to (2 cdot 2450 = 4900). 6. **Final bound**: After each move, turtles on white cells switch to black cells and vice versa. Thus, the number of turtles on the board is bounded by (2 cdot 4900 = 9800). Hence, placing more than 9800 turtles on the board such that they can move indefinitely without collisions is impossible. Therefore, the proof concludes that the maximum number of turtles that can be properly placed and move indefinitely on the board is: ( boxed{9800} )"},{"prompt":"the nodes of the grid of a checkered rectangle, there are 4 light bulbs placed, all of which are initially turned off.

Each move must turn on at least one bulb. Is it possible to turn on all the bulbs in exactly four moves?","completion":"1. First, we need to visualize and understand the positions of the lamps in the rectangular grid and mark the initial configuration where all lamps are turned off. 2. Let's consider a rectangular grid with 4 lamps located at the vertices of the grid. Without loss of generality, assume the lamps are positioned at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). 3. We will begin by drawing an auxiliary line through two lamps situated at diagonally opposite corners. In our case, we can draw a line passing through (0,0) and (1,1). This line cuts the rectangle into two parts. 4. Since no lamps are situated exactly on this line, the auxiliary line does not intersect any other lamps except the two it passes through. Hence, by turning on all lamps below (or above) this line, we can ensure that any lamps below (or above) it will be lit. Similarly, another set of two lamps situated at the top or bottom of this line will be considered. Here, either (0,0), (1,0) or (0,1), (1,1). 5. Next, we construct the first vertical line parallel to the auxiliary line. Place it slightly below one of the previously mentioned diagonal lamps (but above the other lamp if we're moving from top to bottom). This ensures all lamps below this line get turned on, leaving us with already lit (0,0), (1,0) and (1,0) being turned to (0,0), (0,1). Similarly, whenever requisite of lines being lit, vertical lines continue parallelly to auxiliary lines leaving minimal points being dark. 6. Finally, conduct another parallel line slightly higher to enlighten remaining dark lamps. We approach setting lines such that all sides in accordance of room are now enlightened sequentially using moves. 7. Reiterate this approach, illuminating each quadrant of regions being divided by auxiliary line, ensuring no lamp remains unlit. Conduct figures and calculations each move verifying the remaining dark spots. **Conclusion**: By following through horizontal or vertical lines configurations step-by-step and switching them on, a total of 4 moves lights all lamps coherently.

To work with this inequality more conveniently, convert the percentages to fractions and rewrite the inequality. This gives us: [ 0.029 < frac{y}{x} < 0.031 ] Multiplying the entire inequality by 100 to clear the fractions, we get: [ 2.9 < 100 cdot frac{y}{x} < 3.1 ] 4.

Compute the values on both sides: [ 957 < 1000y < 1023 ] Divide by 1000: [ 0.957 < y < 1.023 ] Since y must be an integer, the only possible value for y in this range is 1. Hence, y = 1. 9.

In this case, the population is the 2000 students in the school since the interest in diving among all these students is being considered. - A **sample** is a subset of the population selected for the actual study. Here, the 150 students randomly selected for statistical analysis constitute the sample. 2. **Analyzing Each Option**: - **Option A**: States that the 2000 students are the population. This statement is **correct** because the population, in this context, refers to all 2000 students whose interest in diving is under consideration. - **Option B**: Indicates that the 150 selected students are a sample of the population. This is **correct** as these students represent a smaller group selected from the total population for analysis. - **Option C**: Mentions that the sample size is 150.

To estimate the sum, note that for large (k), (sqrt[1987]{k}) is close to 1 because the 1987th root of (k) grows very slowly.

The answer is no, and we provide a proof using a concrete example. 1. **Consider Triangle ( triangle ABC ):** - Let the sides of the triangle be (AB = 6), (BC = 4), and (CA = 8). 2. **Midpoints of Sides:** - Let ( A_1 ) be the midpoint of ( BC ). - Let ( B_1 ) be the midpoint of ( CA ). 3. **Perpendicular Distances:** - Let ( A_2 ) be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from the incenter ( O ) onto ( BC ). - Let ( B_2 ) be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from the incenter ( O ) onto ( CA ). 4. **Equal Distances:** - We need to check whether ( OA_1 = OB_1 ), meaning the incenter ( O ) is equally distant from the midpoints ( A_1 ) and ( B_1 ). 5. **Verification Using Geometry:** - Given that ( OA_1 = OB_1 ), and the triangles ( triangle O A_1 A_2) and ( triangle O B_1 B_2 ) formed by these points with the incenter are congruent, we must determine if the conditions hold true for any triangle. However, let’s investigate using the given triangle’s sides ( AB = 6 ), ( BC = 4 ), and ( CA = 8 ): 6. **Form Triangle ( A_{1} A_{2} O ) and Triangle ( B_{1} B_{2} O ):** - Since (AA_1) and (CC_1) are midpoints, (A_{1} A_{2}) and (B_{1} B_{2}) are perpendicular distances from midpoint to side. - Based on symmetry in isosceles or equilateral considerations, such formations do not necessarily result in an isosceles triangle. Conclusion: Thus, we have traced our conditions back based on midpoints and perpendiculars that do not necessarily imply that ( triangle ABC ) is isosceles even if the incenter is equidistant from two midpoints. Therefore, the triangle does not have to be isosceles.

Now, we need to find out how this volume of displaced water will affect the height of the water in the fish tank. To do this, we use the volume of the displaced water and the base area of the fish tank to calculate the increase in water height.

The total amount spent on both silver and gold is 3030, so we can write the equation: 1.5S (cost of silver) + 150S (cost of gold) = 3030 Combining like terms, we get: 1.5S + 150S = 3030 151.5S = 3030 Now, we can solve for S by dividing both sides of the equation by 151.5: S = 3030 / 151.5 S = 20 Therefore, the cost of silver per ounce is boxed{20} ."},{"prompt":"Let the complex number z= frac {2i}{1+i}.

The length BD is: [ BD = a - DC = a - frac{b^2}{a} = frac{a^2 - b^2}{a}. ] Using the similarity ratio: [ frac{ED}{b} = frac{BE}{c} = frac{BD}{a} = frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2}. ] Hence, the length of ED and BE can be expressed using the similarity ratios: [ ED = frac{b(a^2 - b^2)}{a^2}, quad BE = frac{c(a^2 - b^2)}{a^2}. ] Thus, the perimeter m_1 of triangle EBD is: [ m_1 = ED + BE + BD = frac{b(a^2 - b^2)}{a^2} + frac{c(a^2 - b^2)}{a^2} + frac{a^2 - b^2}{a}= frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2}(a + b + c). ] Step 5: Combine and Simplify the Expressions Now, we sum the perimeters m_1 and m_2, and divide by m: [ frac{m_1 + m_2}{m} = frac{frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2}(a + b + c) + frac{b}{a}(a + b + c)}{a + b + c}. ] Simplifying: [ frac{m_1 + m_2}{m} = frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2} + frac{b}{a}. ] Rewriting these terms gives us: [ frac{m_1 + m_2}{m} = 1 - left(frac{b}{a}right)^2 + frac{b}{a}. ] Next, using algebraic manipulation: [ 1 - left(frac{b}{a}right)^2 + frac{b}{a} = -left(frac{b}{a} - frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{5}{4}. ] Conclusion Since -left(frac{b}{a} - frac{1}{2}right)^2 leq 0, it follows that: [ -left(frac{b}{a} - frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{5}{4} leq frac{5}{4}. ] Thus, we have shown: [ frac{m_1 + m_2}{m} leq frac{5}{4}. ] boxed{}"},{"prompt":"A 24hour digital clock shows times ( h: m: s ), where ( h, m ), and ( s ) are integers with ( 0 leq h leq 23 ), ( 0 leq m leq 59 ), and ( 0 leq s leq 59 ).

These circles intersect side AC at D and side AB at E, respectively. - Let F be the intersection point of the lines BD and CE. 2. **Key Objective:** Our goal is to prove that points A, D, E, and F lie on a common circle. 3. **Proving Angle Sum to be 180^circ:** We aim to show that angle ADF and angle AEF sum to 180^circ. This will confirm that A, D, F, and E are concyclic (lie on the same circle). 4. **Analyzing triangle ABA_1 and triangle ACA_1:** Since D lies on the circumcircle of triangle A A_1 B: angle ADF = angle ADB = angle AA_1B. Similarly, since E lies on the circumcircle of triangle A A_1 C: angle AEF = angle AEC = angle AA_1C. 5. **Concluding the Proof:** By angle sum property in cyclic quadrilateral, we observe: angle ADF + angle AEF = angle AA_1B + angle AA_1C = 180^circ. Thus, points A, D, E, and F are concyclic. # Different Case Analysis: 6. **Situations When D or E may lie outside the triangle:** - If D or E extends beyond their respective sides, the intersection properties and angle relationships defined in cyclic quadrilaterals still hold with appropriate segments considered. 7. **Conclusion from Multiple Scenarios:** - Evaluations showed the consistency of angles summing to 180^circ, hence: # Conclusion: In all cases, the sum of angle ADF and angle AEF remains 180^circ, proving that A, D, F, and E are concyclic.

This setup can be modeled as a graph where planets are vertices and routes are edges. 2. **Construct the Graph:** We need to draw the graph representing the planets and their interconnections. Here’s the list of routes: - Земля — Меркурий - Плутон — Венера - Земля — Плутон - Плутон — Меркурий - Меркурий — Венера - Уран — Нептун - Нептун — Сатурн - Сатурн — Юпитер - Юпитер — Марс - Марс — Уран 3. **Graph Drawing:** We draw the graph using these connections to understand the structure: \`\`\` Земля ----- Меркурий ----- Венера | | Плутон --------| | Уран ----- Нептун ----- Сатурн ----- Юпитер ----- Марс \`\`\` 4. **Identify Connected Components:** A connected component in a graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph. By examining the graph, we can determine the connected components: - One connected component: {Земля, Меркурий, Венера, Плутон} - Second connected component: {Нептун, Уран, Сатурн, Юпитер, Марс} 5. **Conclusion:** Given that Земля and Марс belong to two different connected components of the graph, there are no paths connecting Земля to Марс through the given routes.

This implies x=t+1. Substituting x with t+1 into the given function, we obtain: [ f(t)=t+1+sqrt{t} ] Thus, when we replace t back with x, the function becomes: [ f(x)=x+1+sqrt{x} ] Comparing this with option A, which suggests f(x)=x+sqrt{x}, we see that our derived function includes an additional +1. Therefore, option A is incorrect. **For option B:** Considering the derived function f(x)=x+1+sqrt{x}, for this function to be meaningful (i.e., for sqrt{x} to be real), x must be greater than or equal to 0. Hence, the domain of f(x) is: [ x geqslant 0 ] This means the domain of f(x) is indeed left[0,+infty right), making option B correct. **For option C:** Given the function f(x)=x+1+sqrt{x}, we note that both components y=x and y=sqrt{x} are monotonically increasing functions within the domain left[0,+infty right). Therefore, the sum of these functions, f(x), is also monotonically increasing within the same domain. This implies that f(x) does not have a maximum value, as it increases indefinitely. Thus, option C is incorrect. **For option D:** Since we have established that f(x) is monotonically increasing and does not have a maximum value, we now look at the minimum value of f(x). Evaluating f(x) at the lower bound of its domain, x=0, we get: [ f(0)=0+1+sqrt{0}=1 ] This indicates that the minimum value of f(x) is 1, and since f(x) increases indefinitely, the range of f(x) is left[1,+infty right).

Therefore, the following card must be of the opposite color. - The problem says the 10th and 11th cards are both red. This implies: - Just before placing the 11th card, the top two cards were of the same color (both red). 3. **Pattern analysis**: - Because the 10th and 11th cards are red, after placing the 11th card, two red cards are on top of the stacks. - The rule that no two cards of the same color stack consecutively will then force the next card (the 12th card) to be black. 4. **General pattern**: - Every time an odd-numbered card is placed, the two top cards must be of the same color. - Since the 25th card is black, at the time of placing the 25th card and after placing it, both top cards are black. 5. **Determining the 26th card**: - According to the alternating rule, after any two same-colored top cards, the next card must be of the opposite color. - Given that the 25th card is black and at this point, there are two black cards on top, the 26th card must be red to follow the rule. # Conclusion The 26th card must be red.
