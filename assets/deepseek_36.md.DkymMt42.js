The radius of the circle centered at M is equal to the distance from M to the origin O, which is |OM| = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}. Thus, the equation of the circle centered at M with radius |OM| can be written as: (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = a^2 + b^2. Given the equation of circle C is: (x-1)^2 + y^2 = 4, we subtract the equation of circle M from the equation of circle C to find the equation of line AB: begin{align*} [(x-1)^2 + y^2] - [(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2] &= 4 - (a^2 + b^2) (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2) - (x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2) &= 0 (2a-2)x + 2by - (a^2 - 2a + 1 + b^2 - 4) &= 0 (2a-2)x + 2by - 3 &= 0, end{align*} which simplifies to the equation of line AB: (2a-2)x + 2by - 3 = 0.

Due to the equality of their angles, these two triangles are similar, however, with opposite orientations. Based on this, the construction can proceed as follows. 1. **Construct the angle ( alpha_1 ) at point ( A )**: Measure the angle (alpha_1) at point (A) along segment (AB). 2. **Construct the angle ( gamma_1 ) at point ( B )**: Measure the angle (gamma_1) at point (B) along segment (AB). 3. **Find point ( M )**: The intersection of the rays passing through these angles gives point (M). Next steps involve creating parallel lines to use these properties: 4. **Measure (DC) from ( A ) towards ( B ) to point ( E )**. 5. **Draw a line through (E) parallel to (AM) and intersect it with ( BM ) at point ( F )**. 6. **Draw a line through (F) parallel to (AB ) and intersect it with (AM) at point ( G )**. 7. **Find points ( C ) and ( D )**: Extend (AM) and (BM) beyond (M) and measure (MF) and (MG) respectively to find (C) and (D). By constructing parallel lines based on these elements: - (MGF) is similar to (triangle MAB) with identical orientation. - (DC = AE = GF) means that (triangle MDC) is congruent with the opposite travel direction. This construction is executable provided that (alpha_1 + gamma_1 < 180^circ). II. Solution: We can bring the sides (AB) and (CD) next to each other by reflecting triangle (ACD) over a line (k) perpendicular to diagonal (AC) (see Fig. 1 still). With reflection: [ D_1 text{ is the reflection of } D text{ such that } D_1A = DC quad text{and} quad angle D_1AC = angle DCA = gamma_1 ] Hence: [ angle D_1AB = alpha_1 + gamma_1 ] In triangle (D_1AB), we now know two sides and the included angle: 1. **Construct the angle ( alpha_1 ) at point ( A )** along ( AB ). 2. **Construct ( gamma_1 ) from the other ray** of ( alpha_1 ), extending (CD) from ( A ) to point ( D_1 ). 3. **Construct the circumcircle of ( triangle ABD_1 )** and this intersects the second ray of ( alpha_1 ) at ( C ). Finally, reflect (D_1) back over the perpendicular bisector of ( AC ): - (D) is found by intersecting the circle centered at (C) radius (CD), giving (D). This construction is valid if (alpha_1 + gamma_1 < 180^circ). III. Solution: We can also use translation to get a helper triangle.

Move segment (AB = N B_2) parallel: - Through point (B_2) draw line parallel to (e), intersect (f) at (B), - Finally, intersect line (BA) parallel to (DB) at point (A).

We realize that retaining both digits from each \\"10\\", \\"20\\", ..., \\"90\\" means we avoid too many deletions early on: - Each of the numbers \\"10\\", \\"20\\", ..., \\"90\\" counts for 2 digits. - You will retain 9 examples, leading to ( 9 times 2 = 18 ) digits. 3. Next, the digits between \\"50\\" and \\"60\\" should retain the zero: - This adds 1 more digit to the count, totaling ( 18 + 1 = 19 ) digits retained. 4.

Find the probability that the circle does not intersect the diagonal (AC). 1. **Translate the problem setup**: Since the circle has a radius of 1, the center of the circle can only be placed within a reduced rectangle where the distance to any edge is at least 1 unit. This effectively reduces the area in which the center can be placed. Specifically, the center must be at least 1 unit away from each of the edges of the original (15 times 36) rectangle. Thus, the rectangle in which the center of the circle can be placed becomes: [ (15 - 2) times (36 - 2) = 13 times 34 ] The area of this rectangle is: [ 13 times 34 = 442 ] 2. **Identify the areas which ensure no intersection with diagonal (AC)**: For the circle not to intersect the diagonal (AC), its center must lie within certain regions of the (13 times 34) rectangle.

As the required distance from the diagonal is exactly 1 unit, these regions can be calculated geometrically. We consider the plot and integrate along with boundary conditions.

To find the probability that at least one of the two randomly chosen students is interested in investment banking, we can use the complement rule.

The probability that the first student chosen is not interested in investment banking is 5/25 (since there are 5 who are not interested out of 25 total members).

Their centroid ( K ) divides the line segment ( B_1C_1 ) in the ratio ( b:c ).

We need to find all integers ( m geq 1 ) such that ( m(m+1) ) is a power of a prime number. Firstly, we assume that ( m(m+1) = p^k ), where ( p ) is a prime number and ( k geq 1 ). 2. Notice that ( m ) and ( m + 1 ) are consecutive integers. Therefore, they are coprime, meaning that their greatest common divisor is 1. 3. Consequently, both ( m ) and ( m + 1 ) must be powers of ( p ). Therefore, we can write ( m = p^a ) and ( m + 1 = p^b ), where ( a, b geq 0 ) and ( a + b geq 1 ). 4. Since ( p^b = m + 1 geq m = p^a ), it follows that ( b geq a ). The difference between these two terms is given by: [ p^b - p^a = 1 ] 5. If ( a geq 1 ), then ( p ) divides both ( p^b ) and ( p^a ), hence ( p ) would also divide 1 (which is impossible for any prime ( p )). Therefore, ( a ) must be 0. 6.

Therefore: [ c^k - b^k = 1 ] Since ( c - b ) divides ( c^k - b^k ), ( c - b ) must divide 1. Given that ( c geq b ), we have ( c = b + 1 ). 10. Substituting ( c = b + 1 ) into the equation, we get: [ (b + 1)^k - b^k = 1 ] 11.

We are not given the exact number of buildings that collapsed after the fifth earthquake, but we know that only a handful of buildings still stood. Since we don't have the exact number for the fifth earthquake, we cannot calculate the total number of buildings that had collapsed after all five earthquakes.

The only single-digit number that can be added to 7 to get a number ending in 0 is 3. Therefore, b must be 3. Now we have: 82a7 + 63 = 190 Subtracting 63 from both sides, we get: 82a7 = 190 - 63 82a7 = 127 Now we need to find the value of a such that when placed in the hundreds place, it makes the number 82a7 equal to 127. The only single-digit number that fits this is 1 because 8217 is equal to 127. So, a = 1 and b = 3.

Each ball is thrown into a box with equal probability, meaning each box has a probability of ( frac{1}{2n} ) of receiving any particular ball. 2. Let ( p_n ) be the probability that no box contains more than one ball. We need to find the limit ( lim_{n to infty} frac{ln p_n}{n} ). 3. Define ( a_k ) as the probability that a specific box is empty after ( k ) balls have been thrown, and ( b_k ) as the probability that a specific box contains exactly one ball after ( k ) balls have been thrown. 4. For ( q = 1 - frac{1}{2n} ), we have: [ a_k = q^k ] This is because the probability that a specific box is empty after ( k ) balls is the probability that each of the ( k ) balls did not go into that box, which is ( q^k ). 5. The probability ( b_k ) can be derived as follows: [ b_k = (1 - q) a_{k-1} + q b_{k-1} ] This recurrence relation accounts for the probability that the box has exactly one ball after ( k ) balls: either the box was empty after ( k-1 ) balls and the ( k )-th ball went into it, or the box already had one ball and the ( k )-th ball did not go into it. 6. Using the initial conditions ( a_1 = q ) and ( b_1 = 1 - q ), we can solve the recurrence relation: [ b_k = (1 - q) q^{k-1} + q b_{k-1} ] By iterating this, we get: [ b_k = k q^{k-1} (1 - q) ] 7.

First, simplify ( p_n ): [ p_n = q^n + n q^{n-1} (1 - q) ] For large ( n ), ( q = 1 - frac{1}{2n} approx e^{-frac{1}{2n}} ), so: [ q^n approx e^{-frac{n}{2n}} = e^{-frac{1}{2}} ] and: [ n q^{n-1} (1 - q) approx n e^{-frac{n-1}{2n}} left( frac{1}{2n} right) approx n e^{-frac{1}{2}} frac{1}{2n} = frac{1}{2} e^{-frac{1}{2}} ] 10. Therefore, for large ( n ): [ p_n approx e^{-frac{1}{2}} + frac{1}{2} e^{-frac{1}{2}} = frac{3}{2} e^{-frac{1}{2}} ] 11. Now, compute the limit: [ lim_{n to infty} frac{ln p_n}{n} = lim_{n to infty} frac{ln left( frac{3}{2} e^{-frac{1}{2}} right)}{n} = lim_{n to infty} frac{ln frac{3}{2} + ln e^{-frac{1}{2}}}{n} = lim_{n to infty} frac{ln frac{3}{2} - frac{1}{2}}{n} = 0 ] The final answer is ( boxed{ 0 } )"},{"prompt":"win's family went on a camping trip in the mountains.

Since the price in dollars was 6, we need to find out how many euros they would have paid and then convert it to dollars. To find out how many euros they paid, we divide the dollar amount by the exchange rate: 6 dollars / 1.5 dollars/euro = 4 euros Now, we convert the euros back to dollars at the fluctuating rate: 4 euros * 1.5 dollars/euro = 6 dollars So, the magician still earned 6 dollars from this transaction. 3. One foreign customer bought 1 deck during the fluctuating rate. Since there is no promotion for a single deck, the deck would be sold at the regular price of 2 dollars. With the exchange rate of 1.5 dollars to 1 euro, we need to find out how many euros the customer paid and then convert it to dollars. To find out how many euros they paid, we divide the dollar amount by the exchange rate: 2 dollars / 1.5 dollars/euro = 1.33 euros (approximately) Now, we convert the euros back to dollars at the fluctuating rate: 1.33 euros * 1.5 dollars/euro = 2 dollars So, the magician earned 2 dollars from this transaction. Now, let's add up all the earnings: Domestic customers: 3 dollars Foreign customers (4 decks): 6 dollars Foreign customer (1 deck): 2 dollars Total earnings in dollars = 3 + 6 + 2 = 11 dollars Therefore, the magician earned boxed{11} dollars in total."},{"prompt":"Two distinct positive integers from 1 to 100 inclusive are chosen.

Additionally, every prime not exceeding (sqrt{n}) divides ( ab ). Let's break down the problem: 1. **Verify Small Cases:** - ( n = 2 ): ( 2 = 1^2 + 1^2 ). - ( n = 5 ): ( 5 = 1^2 + 2^2 ). - ( n = 13 ): ( 13 = 2^2 + 3^2 ). 2. **Analyze the Conditions:** - ( a ) and ( b ) are relatively prime. This means (gcd(a, b) = 1). 3. **Prove (a) and (b) must be consecutive integers:** - If we assume ( a = b ), then since ( a ) and ( b ) are relatively prime, they must both be 1. This yields ( n = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 ), which we have already accounted for. - Therefore, we can assume ( a > b ). 4. **Consider the difference ( a - b ):** [ (a - b)^2 < a^2 + b^2 = n ] This implies (a - b < sqrt{n}). 5. **Dive deeper into the difference:** - Suppose ( a - b neq 1 ). It must have a prime factor ( p ) that divides ( ab ). Thus, ( p ) divides either ( a ) or ( b ) (since ( gcd(a, b) = 1 )). - If ( p ) divides only ( a ) or only ( b ), this would contradict the assumption that ( p ) is a factor of ( a - b ) but not both ( a ) and ( b ). 6. **Conclude ( a - b = 1 ):** - This implies ( a = b + 1 ). - Substitute ( a = b + 1 ) into the expression ( n = a^2 + b^2 ): [ n = (b + 1)^2 + b^2 = b^2 + 2b + 1 + b^2 = 2b^2 + 2b + 1 ] Now, ((b - 1)^2 < b^2 < n). Thus, any prime factor of ( b - 1 ) must also divide ( b(b + 1) ). - Any prime factor ( p ) of ( b - 1 ) cannot divide ( b ) (or it would divide ( b ) and ( b - 1 ), hence it would divide 1 which is impossible). Therefore, ( p ) must divide ( b + 1 ). 7. **Special consideration for ( p = 2 ):** - The above implies ( b - 1 ) must be ( 0, 1, ) or ( 2 ). 8. **Check Specific Cases:** - ( b - 1 = 0 ) implies ( b = 1 ) and ( a = 2 ): [ n = 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5 ] - ( b - 1 = 1 ) implies ( b = 2 ) and ( a = 3 ): [ n = 2^2 + 3^2 = 4 + 9 = 13 ] - ( b - 1 = 2 ) implies ( b = 3 ) and ( a = 4 ): [ n = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 ] Conclusion: The positive integers ( n ) which meet the given conditions are [ boxed{2, 5, 13} ]"},{"prompt":"Thomas has been saving a certain amount in the bank every month for six years.

The total amount saved by Thomas in 72 months is 72T, and the total amount saved by Joseph in 72 months is 72J. The sum of their savings is: 72T + 72J = 4608 We can substitute J with (3/5)T: 72T + 72*(3/5)T = 4608 Now, we can solve for T: 72T + (216/5)T = 4608 To combine the terms, we need a common denominator, which is 5: (360/5)T + (216/5)T = 4608 (360T + 216T) / 5 = 4608 576T / 5 = 4608 Now, multiply both sides by 5 to solve for T: 576T = 4608 * 5 576T = 23040 Now, divide both sides by 576 to find T: T = 23040 / 576 T = 40 So, Thomas saves boxed{40} per month."},{"prompt":"Let m = 2^3 cdot 3^2 cdot 5^4 cdot 10^5.

Substituting x = 160 into the equation, we get: y = -3(160) + 900 = -480 + 900 = 420 Since the government subsidizes 20 yuan per piece, the total monthly subsidy can be calculated as: text{Monthly Subsidy} = y times text{Subsidy per piece} = 420 times 20 = 8400 Therefore, the government subsidizes boxed{8400} yuan each month. Part 2: Maximizing Total Monthly Revenue Let w represent Wang Hua's total monthly revenue (in yuan). The total revenue is the sum of monthly sales profit and monthly government subsidy. Given the cost price is 100 yuan per piece and the government subsidy is 20 yuan per piece, the profit per piece (including subsidy) is (x - 100 + 20). The monthly sales volume y is given by the linear function y = -3x + 900. Therefore, the total monthly revenue w can be expressed as: w = (x - 100 + 20)(-3x + 900) = -3(x - 80)(x - 300) = -3(x - 190)^2 + 36300 Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative (-3 < 0), the function w opens downwards, indicating that the maximum value of w occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex form of a quadratic function y = a(x - h)^2 + k gives the maximum value at x = h when a < 0. Here, h = 190, so the selling price x = 190 yuan maximizes the total revenue.

Knowing that lg 10 = 1 and lg left(frac{1}{100}right) = lg (10^{-2}) = -2 cdot lg 10 = -2, we can simplify the expression further: lg left(frac{1}{100}right) = -2. 3. Now we will multiply the obtained logarithmic value with the given exponential expression: (-2) times 10^{frac{1}{2}} = (-2) times sqrt{10}. 4. Since sqrt{10} is approximately equal to 3.162, we multiply it with -2: (-2) times 3.162 = -6.324. 5. As a result, we have: left(lg frac{1}{4} - lg 25right) times 10^{frac{1}{2}} approx -6.324. However, upon revisiting the original solution, it seems there was a simplification oversight. The multiplier should be 10^frac{1}{2}, which is equivalent to sqrt{10} but the translation provided here suggests a direct multiplication, which seems incorrect. Instead, the exponential expression should be simplified as follows: 6. Recognize that 10^{frac{1}{2}} is equivalent to the square root of 10, which is sqrt{10}: 10^{frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{10}. 7. This means that we should not be approximating the value of sqrt{10} in this context, because simplifying the expression -2 times sqrt{10} should result in -2 times 10^{frac{1}{2}} being evaluated as a power of 10: (-2) times 10^{frac{1}{2}} = (-2) times sqrt{10} = -2 times 10^{frac{1}{2}}. 8. Realize that -2 times 10^{frac{1}{2}} can be considered as -2 multiplied by 10 raised to the power of frac{1}{2}, which, when evaluated, equals -10^1: -2 times 10^{frac{1}{2}} = -10^1 = -10.

Since she had 1/2D miles left after the first stop, 1/4 of this remaining distance is (1/4) * (1/2D) = 1/8D.

The velocity of the stream is 4 kmph and the speed of the boat in still water is 14 kmph. What is the distance between A and B?","completion":"Let's denote the distance between A and B as D km. When the boat is going downstream, the effective speed of the boat is the sum of the speed of the boat in still water and the velocity of the stream. So, the downstream speed is 14 kmph (speed of the boat in still water) + 4 kmph (velocity of the stream) = 18 kmph. When the boat is going upstream, the effective speed of the boat is the speed of the boat in still water minus the velocity of the stream. So, the upstream speed is 14 kmph (speed of the boat in still water) - 4 kmph (velocity of the stream) = 10 kmph. The boat travels downstream from A to B and then upstream back to point C, which is midway between A and B. This means the boat travels a distance of D km downstream and then D/2 km upstream. The time taken to travel downstream from A to B is the distance divided by the downstream speed, which is D/18 hours. The time taken to travel upstream from B to C is (D/2)/10 hours, which is D/20 hours. The total time for the entire trip is given as 19 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation: D/18 + D/20 = 19 To solve for D, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 180. We can rewrite the equation as: (10D)/180 + (9D)/180 = 19 Combine the terms: (10D + 9D)/180 = 19 19D/180 = 19 Multiply both sides by 180 to solve for D: 19D = 19 * 180 D = 19 * 180 / 19 D = 180 So, the distance between A and B is boxed{180} km."},{"prompt":"Given tan (alpha+beta)=3, tan beta=2, find the value of tan alpha ( ) A: 3 B: 3 C: dfrac {1}{7} D: dfrac {1}{7}","completion":"1.

Using this equivalence, we rewrite the expression again: cos (frac{9pi}{4}) + sin (frac{9pi}{4}) = cos (2pi + frac{pi}{4}) + sin (2pi + frac{pi}{4}) Now, we can apply the identities cos(2pi + x) = cos(x) and sin(2pi + x) = sin(x) to simplify the expression: cos (2pi + frac{pi}{4}) + sin (2pi + frac{pi}{4}) = cos (frac{pi}{4}) + sin (frac{pi}{4}) Finally, we use the fact that cos (frac{pi}{4}) = sin (frac{pi}{4}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} to find the value of the expression: cos (frac{pi}{4}) + sin (frac{pi}{4}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = boxed{sqrt{2}} Therefore, the correct answer is A: sqrt{2}.

This means f(1^-) leq f(1^+). - Calculating f(1^-) using the quadratic part gives f(1) = -(1)^2 - 2a(1) - 5 = -1 - 2a - 5. - Calculating f(1^+) using the rational part gives f(1) = frac{a}{1} = a. - Thus, we have -1 - 2a - 5 leq a, which simplifies to -6 - 2a leq a. 4. **Solving the inequalities**: - From 1 leq -a, we get a leq -1. - From a < 0, we keep it as is since it directly defines a as negative. - From -6 - 2a leq a, we get -6 leq 3a, which simplifies to a geq -2. Combining these conditions, we find that a must satisfy all of the following: - a leq -1 (from the condition on the symmetry axis and the function being increasing up to x = 1), - a < 0 (to ensure the rational part is increasing for x > 1), - a geq -2 (from ensuring continuity and a smooth transition at x = 1). The intersection of these conditions is -2 leq a leq -1. Therefore, the range of real number a for which f(x) is an increasing function on mathbb{R} is boxed{[-2, -1]}.

Also, q(e)=e^{3}-me+e, so (i) when mleqslant e^{2}+1, q(e)geqslant 0, q(x) has no zeros in (e,+infty); (ii) when 3e^{2}geqslant m > e^{2}+1, q(e) < 0, and q(2e)=8e^{3}-2me+egeqslant 6e^{3}-e > 0, thus, in this case, q(x) has exactly one zero in (e,+infty); when m > 3e^{2}, let q'(x)=0, we get x=± sqrt { dfrac {m}{3}}. From q'(x) < 0, we have e < x < sqrt { dfrac {m}{3}}; from q'(x) > 0, we have x > sqrt { dfrac {m}{3}}. Thus, q(x) is decreasing in (e, sqrt { dfrac {m}{3}}) and increasing in ( sqrt { dfrac {m}{3}},+infty). Since q(e)=e^{3}-me+e < e^{3}-3e^{3}+e < 0, q(m)=m^{3}-m^{2}+e > m^{2}-m^{2}+e=e > 0, thus, in this case, q(x) has exactly one zero in (e,+infty). In summary, when m < e^{2}+1, h(x) has no zeros; when m=e^{2}+1, h(x) has one zero; when m > e^{2}+1, h(x) has two zeros. Therefore, the final answers are a=2 for part (1), aleqslant 1 for part (2), and for part (3), depending on the value of m, h(x) can have 0, 1, or 2 zeros, encapsulated as boxed{a=2}, boxed{aleqslant 1}, and the conditions for the number of zeros of h(x) respectively."},{"prompt":"Which of the following calculations is correct?

Each side of the original square has been divided into 8 equal segments, creating 7 points along each side (excluding the corners). The problem can be approached using two methods. We will go through each method in detail starting with Method 1. Method 1: 1. **Counting Triangles with Vertices on Different Sides**: - We first ensure that the three vertices of the triangle do not all lie on the same side of the square. - There are 4 choices for which three of the four sides will each provide a vertex. - On each of these three sides, we can choose any one of the 7 points as a vertex, giving 7^3 combinations.

This leads to two conditions: - Since the inequality ax > b holds for x < -1, it implies that a must be negative for the inequality to reverse when multiplied by a negative number (since x is less than -1 and we want the product ax to be greater than b). Thus, we have a < 0. - At x = -1, substituting into ax > b gives -a leq b, which simplifies to b = -a (since for x just smaller than -1, the inequality must switch from not holding to holding, the boundary condition at x = -1 gives us this equality). 2. **Condition from y^{2}+3y+b > 0 with solution set R:** For the quadratic inequality y^{2}+3y+b > 0 to have no real roots (which is why its solution set is all real numbers R), the discriminant must be less than 0.

C: Based on the small probability value alpha =0.001, it is concluded from the independence test that gender and whether the audience enjoys watching table tennis matches are not related. D: Assuming a probability of making an error not exceeding 0.001, it is concluded that gender and whether the audience enjoys watching table tennis matches are related.","completion":"To solve this problem, we first address the statements given in the options: **Step 1: Calculating the frequency of females who enjoy watching table tennis matches** Given in the problem, the number of females who enjoy watching table tennis matches is 20, and the total number of spectators who enjoy watching is 60+20=80. Therefore, the frequency of females who enjoy watching is calculated as: [P = frac{20}{60+20} = frac{20}{80} = frac{1}{4}] Hence, option A is correct because it accurately represents the calculated frequency. **Step 2: Calculating the frequency of males who enjoy watching table tennis matches** The number of males who enjoy watching table tennis matches is 60, and the total number of spectators who enjoy watching is 100. Therefore, the frequency of males who enjoy watching is calculated as: [P' = frac{60}{100} = frac{3}{5}] However, option B suggests a frequency of frac{2}{3}, which is incorrect based on our calculation.

Consider placing nails in cells as follows, arranged symmetrically to avoid any three being in a straight line: - The cells ((1,1)), ((1,3)), ((1,5)), ((1,7)) - The cells ((3,1)), ((3,3)), ((3,5)), ((3,7)) - The cells ((5,1)), ((5,3)), ((5,5)), ((5,7)) - The cells ((7,1)), ((7,3)), ((7,5)), ((7,7)) 4. **Check for Collinearity:** For a set of three points ((x_1,y_1)), ((x_2,y_2)), and ((x_3,y_3)) to be collinear, the following determinant must be zero: [ begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 & 1 x_2 & y_2 & 1 x_3 & y_3 & 1 end{vmatrix} = 0 ] Substitute our coordinates in pairs, we test for collinearity: - For example: - ((1,1)), ((1,3)), and ((1,5)) are in the same row but such subsets are excluded in our placement. - Following similar procedures for other pairs, we can conclude none of the subsets violate the collinear property as each one is uniquely isolated placing symmetrically. 5. **Verification Through Visualization:** As illustrated in the attached diagram, this particular selection avoids alignment restrictions.

Since it passes through the focus of the parabola y^2 = 2x, the focus is at (frac{1}{2}, 0). Thus, the equation of the line can be written as x=my+frac{1}{2}, where m is the slope of the line. Let A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}) be the points of intersection. By substituting x = my + frac{1}{2} into y^2 = 2x, we get: [y^2 = 2(my + frac{1}{2}) Rightarrow y^2 - 2my - 1 = 0] From this quadratic equation in y, we can find the discriminant Delta = 4m^2 + 4 > 0, which is always positive, indicating two real roots for y. The sum and product of roots formula gives us y_{1} + y_{2} = 2m and y_{1}y_{2} = -1. Now, the distance |AB| can be found using the distance formula, which gives: [|AB| = sqrt{(x_{1} - x_{2})^2 + (y_{1} - y_{2})^2} = sqrt{1+m^2}sqrt{(y_{1} + y_{2})^2 - 4y_{1}y_{2}} = sqrt{1+m^2}sqrt{4(1+m^2)} = 2sqrt{1+m^2}] Given that |AB| = 3, we set 2sqrt{1+m^2} = 3 and solve for m^2: [1 + m^2 = frac{9}{4} Rightarrow m^2 = frac{1}{2}] Thus, the absolute value of the slope of line l is |m| = sqrt{frac{1}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, not 2sqrt{2}. Therefore, option A is incorrect. To find |AF| - |BF|, we consider the distances along the line l: [|AF| - |BF| = |x_{1} - x_{2}| = |m(y_{1} - y_{2})| = |2msqrt{1+m^2}| = sqrt{3}] Thus, option B is correct. Since |AF| - |BF| = sqrt{3} and |AF| + |BF| = 3, solving these equations simultaneously gives |AF| = frac{3 + sqrt{3}}{2} and |BF| = frac{3 - sqrt{3}}{2}. Therefore, |AF|cdot|BF| = frac{3}{2}, making option C correct. Finally, the ratio frac{|AF|}{|BF|} = frac{3 + sqrt{3}}{3 - sqrt{3}} = 2 + sqrt{3}, so option D is also correct.

Every combination of two intersection points from each pair of lines in ( S_2 ) will pair with each line in ( S_3 ) to form a triangle. 4. **Intersect Points from Different Families**: - For the lines in ( S_1 ), pick any two points of intersection from the lines in ( S_2 ) (i.e., we pick two out of 10 lines).

Since points A and B are on the ellipse, the discriminant of the equation must be positive: Delta = -12m^2 + 64 > 0. Let's denote the coordinates of points A and B as (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) respectively. Then we have: x_1 + x_2 = -frac{3m}{2}, quad x_1x_2 = frac{3m^2 - 4}{4}. So, the length of AB is: |AB| = sqrt{2}|x_1 - x_2| = frac{sqrt{32 - 6m^2}}{2}. Also, the length of BC is equal to the distance of point (0, m) to the line l, which gives us |BC| = frac{|2 - m|}{sqrt{2}}. Thus, the square of the length of AC is: |AC|^2 = |AB|^2 + |BC|^2 = -m^2 - 2m + 10 = -(m + 1)^2 + 11. Therefore, when m = -1, the length of AC is the longest, and at this point, the discriminant is Delta = -12 + 64 > 0.

We need to prove that regardless of the initial configuration of the coins, there exists a sequence of operations such that all coins end up with the same side up. 2. **Graph Theory Approach:** We can model this problem using a bipartite graph ( G(A, B) ), where ( A ) represents the set of persons ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2019}} ) and ( B ) represents the set of coins ( {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{2019}} ).

This can be seen using the fact that ( n equiv 1 pmod{n-1} ) (as any number raised to a power and then taken modulo ( n-1 ) reduces to 1). 3. **Proof of Divisibility:** Using the property of congruences: [ n equiv 1 pmod{n-1} ] [ n^n equiv 1^n equiv 1 pmod{n-1} ] [ -6n equiv -6 pmod{n-1} ] [ 5 equiv 5 pmod{n-1} ] Adding these congruences: [ n^n - 6n + 5 equiv 1 - 6 + 5 equiv 0 pmod{n-1} ] Therefore, ( n^n - 6n + 5 ) is divisible by ( n-1 ), implying ( n-1 ) is a factor of ( n^n - 6n + 5 ). 4. **Implications of Divisibility:** For ( n^n - 6n + 5 ) to be prime, it should have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.

(1) For cos^2left(α+ frac {π}{4}right), we need the square of the expression (1).

The diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect at point (O). This divides the quadrilateral into four triangles: (triangle AOB), (triangle BOC), (triangle COD), and (triangle DOA). 3. **Introduce Homothety**: Apply a homothety (geometric transformation) with center (O) and a homothety ratio of (frac{3}{2}). 4. **Effect of Homothety on Medians**: Recall that homothety with ratio (k) enlarges or reduces distances from the center of homothety by the factor of (k). In our case, the ratio is (frac{3}{2}), which means all points will be mapped to new points that are (1.5) times further from (O). 5. **Intersection Points and Homothety**: The intersection points of the medians of triangles (triangle AOB), (triangle BOC), (triangle COD), and (triangle DOA), denoted by (G_1), (G_2), (G_3), and (G_4), will transform under homothety. Each of these points (G_i) (intersection point of medians or centroid) will map to the midpoints of the sides of the quadrilateral (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) respectively. 6. **Resultant Shape After Homothety**: Under the homothety, the points (G_1), (G_2), (G_3), and (G_4) will move to the midpoints of (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA). 7. **Midpoints of Quadrilateral**: We know the midpoints of the sides of any quadrilateral form a parallelogram.

(Ⅱ) Since f(x) is increasing on the interval [0,1], we can evaluate the maximum and minimum values at the endpoints of the interval: f_{text{max}} = f(1) = ln(5) + 1^2 = ln(5) + 1, f_{text{min}} = f(0) = ln(3) + 0^2 = ln(3). Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) on [0,1] is boxed{ln(5) + 1} and the minimum value is boxed{ln(3)}."},{"prompt":"Let ( A ) be a point on the parabola ( y = x^2 6x + 11 ), and let ( B ) be a point on the line ( y = 2x 5 ).

Let's delve into the details. 1. **Initial Setup and Basic Angle Calculation**: - Recognize that the angle between the two walls is (20^{circ}). - We know that Bruno's ball experienced an intersection after 3 reflections, but now we need to focus on Pedro's case. - Start by analyzing each segment created by the reflections. 2. **First Reflection**: - Upon reflection from the first wall, if the incidence angle is (x), the reflection angle will also be (x) due to the perfect reflection property. - Let’s map out the angles in the first triangle of incidence and reflection. 3. **Second Reflection**: - We apply the internal angle property of triangles and reflect the trajectory. - By summing the internal angle of the formed triangle and the external angle properties, the angles indicative of reflection direction can be established. 4. **Calculating Next Angles**: - Important to note the internal angle property: for a triangle, the sum of the angles equals (180^{circ}). - When the ball reflects off the second wall and forms a new triangle, its interior angles determine the next path. - For any triangle ( triangle ABC ): [ angle A + angle B + angle C = 180^{circ} ] 5. **Third and Subsequent Reflections**: - Continue applying the reflection rules for successive reflections. - For each reflection, an angle formed by the trajectory with the walls needs to respect the property that interior angles sum to (180^{circ}) and exterior angles are the consequent sums of the interior ones. 6. **Specific Calculations**: - Applying this consistently: [ text{First Reflection Angle} = 20^{circ} ] - Breaking down further reflections: - Second reflection: [ measuredangle BCO = 40^{circ} + 20^{circ} = 60^{circ} ] - Third reflection: [ measuredangle DCO = 60^{circ} + 20^{circ} = 80^{circ} ] 7. **Critical Fifth Reflection Calculation**: - In the trajectory ( triangle EDO ): [ measuredangle EDO = 80^{circ} ] - Thus leading to intersecting paths: [ measuredangle DEO = 180^{circ} - 100^{circ} = 80^{circ} ] - This angle re-cools the trajectory to reflect congruently, thus leading paths intersection. 8. **Conclusion of Reflection Intersection**: - After systematically analyzing angle changes after each reflection, it’s apparent that the ball intersects its own path after **5 reflections**. Thus, the number of reflections suffered by Pedro's ball before its trajectory intersects itself is: [ boxed{5} ]"},{"prompt":"Given vectors vec{a} = left(x^2, x + 1right) and vec{b} = (1 x, t), find the range of values for t such that the function f(x) = vec{a} cdot vec{b} is monotonically increasing on the interval (1, 1).","completion":"Given the vectors (vec{a} = left(x^2, x+1right)) and (vec{b} = (1-x, t)).

The arrangement of these digits can be thought of as choosing positions for the three '3's out of the seven positions available, since the rest will automatically be filled with '1's. The number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 7 for the '3's is calculated using combinations: [ binom{7}{3} = frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = 35 ] # Step 2: Partitioning the Arrangement into Three Groups After arranging the digits, we need to partition this string of 7 digits into three groups, each representing the price of a prize. Each group must contain at least one digit, which means we are essentially dividing the string into three non-empty parts. This can be thought of as a problem of distributing 7 identical items (the digits) into 3 distinct boxes (the prizes) where each box must contain at least one item. The solution to this problem is given by the formula for combinations with restrictions: [ x + y + z = 7 text{ where } x, y, z > 0 ] This is equivalent to placing two dividers among the 7 digits to create three groups, which can be calculated as: [ binom{6}{2} = frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 ] # Step 3: Adjusting for Overcounting However, this calculation includes configurations where one of the prizes could be worth a 5-digit number, which is not allowed since each prize is worth a whole number of dollars from 1 to 9999. The overcounted configurations are those where one group gets 5 digits, and the other two get 1 digit each. There are 3 such configurations: (5,1,1), (1,5,1), (1,1,5). Subtracting these from the total gives us the adjusted number of ways to partition the digits into three groups: [ binom{6}{2} - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 ] # Step 4: Calculating the Total Number of Possible Guesses Finally, for each of the 35 arrangements of the digits, there are 12 valid ways to partition them into three groups.

The perimeter P can be calculated as follows: [P = 3cm + 7cm + 7cm] [P = 17cm] This configuration satisfies the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

Solution.** 1. Consider a regular tetrahedron (ABCD) with an edge length of 2 units. 2. Identify the midpoints of edges (AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, ) and (CD) as points (E, F, G, H, I,) and (J) respectively. 3. Note that the tetrahedron (AEFG), for example, is a scaled-down version of tetrahedron (ABCD) with a scaling ratio of (frac{1}{2}) from point (A). Therefore, it is a regular tetrahedron with unit edge length. 4. Similarly, construct scaled-down tetrahedra with respect to vertices (B, C,) and (D). 5. Observe that (EFGHIJ) forms a regular octahedron with each edge of unit length. Given the definition of a regular octahedron, the edges are equal, and the face angles and dihedral angles are consistent with those of the regular tetrahedron. 6. Thus, the regular tetrahedron with a 2-unit edge is decomposed into 4 regular tetrahedra and 1 regular octahedron. 7. Reversing the decomposition, it is also true that 4 congruent regular tetrahedra and 1 regular octahedron with equal edge lengths can form a regular tetrahedron with twice the edge length. 8. As shown in Gy. 3221 (KoMaL 1999/3. issue, p. 151), 6 congruent regular octahedra and 8 regular tetrahedra with matching edge lengths can assemble into a regular octahedron with twice the edge length. 9. To validate the problem statement, continue combining regular tetrahedra and octahedra to form larger and larger constructs. This recursive process results in tetrahedra and octahedra of any desired size, thus filling space without gaps or overlaps. This completes the first solution approach. **II. Solution.** 1. Align two regular octahedra so that they share one edge and each octahedron is oriented such that the distance between corresponding vertices (denoted as (A_1, A_2) for one octahedron and (B_1, B_2) for the other) equals the edge length. 2. This configuration ensures that the triangles (A_1A_2B_2) and (B_1B_2C_2) are co-planar. 3. Similarly, the triangle (A_1B_1B_2) lies in the same plane. 4. Similarly, consider alignment and co-planarity for the triangles involving (A_1, B_1,) and (C_3). 5. Therefore, tetrahedron (A_1B_1B_2B_3) is regular and fits between two octahedra. 6. The regular tetrahedron (A_4B_2B_3B_4) is situated similarly between the two octahedra. 7. Continuing this pattern fills the spaces between the octahedra with regular tetrahedra, creating a regular infinite prism. 8. The infinitely extended prism intersects a plane perpendicular to the common edge, forming rhombuses. 9. Covering the entire plane with these rhombuses without gaps or overlaps implies that the space can also be filled without gaps or overlaps by the infinite prisms composed of the mentioned tetrahedra and octahedra. Concluding both solution approaches, we've shown that space can indeed be filled with congruent regular tetrahedra and regular octahedra of matching edge lengths, without gaps or overlaps.

The foci are on the x-axis and symmetric about the origin, indicating that the transverse axis is along the x-axis. The given condition corresponds to the right branch of the hyperbola because x>0 for the locus of P. The standard form of a hyperbola with its transverse axis along the x-axis is frac{x^2}{a^2}-frac{y^2}{b^2}=1. Given the real axis length is 2, and considering the given condition, we deduce the equation of the hyperbola as: x^2-frac{y^2}{3}=1 quad (x>0) Thus, the equation of the curve Gamma is boxed{x^2-frac{y^2}{3}=1 quad (x>0)}. Part (2): Area of triangle APQ Given overrightarrow{FP}=-3overrightarrow{FQ}, we can express this vector relationship in terms of coordinates. Let Q(x,y), then: overrightarrow{FP}=({6-3x,-3y}) This implies the coordinates of P are (8-3x,-3y). Since both P and Q lie on Gamma, their coordinates satisfy the hyperbola's equation: left{begin{array}{l}3{x^2}-{y^2}=3 3{(8-3x)^2}-{(-3y)^2}=3end{array}right. Solving this system yields Qleft(frac{3}{2},pmfrac{sqrt{15}}{2}right). For both possible Q points, the coordinates of P are left(frac{7}{2},mpfrac{3sqrt{15}}{2}right).

Let ( G ) be a graph where vertices represent tourists and edges represent familiarity between tourists. The condition that among every three tourists, at least two are not familiar translates to ( G ) having no ( K_3 ) (triangle) subgraph. The condition that any partition of the group into two buses has at least two familiar tourists in one bus implies that ( G ) is not bipartite, meaning ( G ) contains at least one odd cycle. 2. **Edge Addition:** We add edges to ( G ) to form a new graph ( G' ) such that ( G' ) still has no ( K_3 ) and remains non-bipartite. This means ( G' ) will still have an odd cycle. If we can prove the problem for ( G' ), the degree of the vertex found in ( G' ) will be at least as large as the degree of the same vertex in ( G ). 3. **Key Claim:** We claim that ( G' ) contains a cycle of length 5.

This would form a cycle ( A_1 - A_2 - A_3 - A_4 - K ) of length 5, which is less than ( 2k+1 ), contradicting the minimality again. 5. **Induced 5-Cycle:** Denote the vertices of our 5-cycle as ( B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5 ) with degrees ( b_i ). This cycle is an induced cycle, meaning ( B_i ) is connected to ( B_j ) if and only if ( |i-j| equiv 1 pmod{5} ). 6. **Double Counting Argument:** Consider a vertex ( X ) not in the 5-cycle.

Identify points on the line l. Given l: y=2x+3, we can choose points A(0,3) and B(-1,1) which lie on this line. This is because substituting x=0 into the equation yields y=3, and substituting x=-1 yields y=1. 2. Find the symmetric points of A and B with respect to P(2,3). The symmetric point of A(0,3) with respect to P is found by reflecting A across P, resulting in C(4,3). Similarly, reflecting B(-1,1) across P gives D(5,5). The symmetry implies that the midpoint between each original point and its image is P. Thus, for A and C, the midpoint formula left(frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, frac{y_1+y_2}{2}right) gives (2,3), confirming C(4,3). The same applies to B and D, confirming D(5,5). 3.

Without loss of generality (w.l.o.g), assume the ( p )-adic valuations of ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are ordered as: v_p(a) leq v_p(b) leq v_p(c). 2. **Properties of ( p )-adic Valuations:** Recall the properties of ( p )-adic valuations: - For any non-zero integers ( r ) and ( s ), the valuation of a ratio is given by: v_pleft(frac{r}{s}right) = v_p(r) - v_p(s). - For any two integers ( x ) and ( y ), the valuation of their sum satisfies: v_p(x pm y) geq min(v_p(x), v_p(y)). 3. **Valuations of Given Terms:** Evaluate the ( p )-adic valuations of each given term: - For ( frac{b c}{a} ), we have: v_pleft(frac{b c}{a}right) = v_p(b) + v_p(c) - v_p(a). - For ( frac{a c}{b} ), we get: v_pleft(frac{a c}{b}right) = v_p(a) + v_p(c) - v_p(b). - For ( frac{a b}{c} ), it holds that: v_pleft(frac{a b}{c}right) = v_p(a) + v_p(b) - v_p(c). 4. **Valuation of the Sum:** The problem states that the sum: S = frac{a b}{c} + frac{a c}{b} + frac{b c}{a} is an integer. Therefore: v_p(S) geq 0. 5. **Valuation Argument:** Use the property of valuations for sums: v_p(S) geq minleft(v_pleft(frac{a b}{c}right), v_pleft(frac{a c}{b}right), v_pleft(frac{b c}{a}right)right). 6. **Detailed Evaluations:** Since the sum ( S ) is an integer, the minimum valuation must be at least zero: v_pleft(frac{a b}{c} + frac{a c}{b} + frac{b c}{a}right) geq 0. We explore individual term valuations: - Given the initial ordering ( v_p(a) leq v_p(b) leq v_p(c) ), it implies: v_pleft(frac{a b}{c}right) = v_p(a) + v_p(b) - v_p(c) geq 0, v_pleft(frac{a c}{b}right) = v_p(a) + v_p(c) - v_p(b) geq 0, v_pleft(frac{b c}{a}right) = v_p(b) + v_p(c) - v_p(a) geq 0. 7. **Conclusion:** Since these inequalities must hold for every prime ( p ), it follows that the terms: frac{a b}{c}, quad frac{a c}{b}, quad frac{b c}{a} must each be non-negative integers. Thus, each term individually is an integer.

Prove that the vectors can be indexed such that for all ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n ), the length of the sum of the first ( k ) vectors does not exceed 3. 1. **Consider the \\"one-dimensional\\" version of the problem.** **Lemma 1:** Let ( n ) numbers, each with an absolute value not exceeding 1, and the sum of all these numbers equals 0. Then, they can be indexed in such a way that for any ( i leq n ), the sum of the first ( i ) of them is at most 1 in absolute value. 2. **Proof of Lemma 1:** Separate the given numbers into positive ones: (a_{1}, ldots, a_{k}) and non-positive ones: (b_{1}, ldots, b_{n-k}). Define ( c_{1} = a_{1} ), ( c_{2} = b_{1} ). If ( c_{1} + c_{2} < 0 ), set ( c_{3} = a_{2} ); if ( c_{1} + c_{2} geq 0 ), set ( c_{3} = b_{2} ). Continue this process: if the sum of the chosen numbers is negative, choose the next positive number; if the sum is non-negative, choose the next non-positive number. Verify that this leads to sums not exceeding 1 in absolute value. 3. **Application of Lemma 1 to solve problem a:** Project the given vectors into a coordinate system ( Oxy ), choosing the system such that the sum of vectors pointing upward (in the half-plane ( y > 0 )) is directed exactly along the y-axis. The remaining vectors (pointing downward) will then sum to (-s). Focus on the x-components ( p_{1}, ldots, p_{k} ) of the vectors pointing up. Because the x-component sum is zero, by Lemma 1, we can index these numbers such that the cumulative sum up to any ( i leq k ) does not exceed 1 in absolute value. The same is true for vectors pointing downward. Combining the indices of both upward and downward-pointing vectors, we get sums that obey the bound ( |y| leq 1 ) and ( left| x right| leq 2 ). Thus, the total length is (sqrt{5}), and since this holds for combined vectors, the statement is proven. Therefore, we conclude that: [ boxed{left| v_{1} + ldots + v_{i} right| leq sqrt{5}}. ] **Problem b:** Given ( n ) vectors with a sum of zero, each vector's length not exceeding 1, prove an analogous statement to problem a. 1. **Apply Lemma 1 and previous logic:** Use the same process of separation and summing according to Lemma 1 and project the vectors' y-components as before. If the vectors' lengths do not exceed 1 (not necessarily equal to 1), the previous approach can still be applied. Any feasible projection would still hold within the bounding criteria specified by the vectors' properties. **Problem c:** Explore whether the number 3 in problem a can be replaced by a smaller number. Improve the bound in problem b. 1. **Improving the Bound:** Through a more refined analysis, smaller bounds might be derived. For unit vectors in the plane summing to zero, the best possible bound through careful arrangement might go down to ( sqrt{2} ) and possible even further considering decomposition techniques and geometric constraints. **Exercise 2:** Prove that the bound ( left| v_{1} + ldots + v_{i} right| leq frac{sqrt{5}}{2} ) can be achieved through optimal arrangement and cannot be improved further. Show that for any ( C < frac{sqrt{5}}{2} ), there is a configuration of unit vectors in the plane summing to zero where the cumulative sum exceeds ( C ). In conclusion, a thorough analysis using decomposition, vector projection, and optimal arrangements can refine the bounds for the sum of unit vectors in the plane, ensuring various constraints are met.

For a diagonal (A_0A_n), the situation is symmetrical around (n=200). 3. **Distance Calculations and the Requirement for the Diagonals:** The distance from (O) to the diagonal (A_0A_n) when doubled is equal to the distance (A_{200}A_n), because the triangle (A_0A_nA_{200}) forms a right angle at (A_n). 4. **Formulate the Deviation Function:** Define the deviation function (d_k) as: [ d_k = left| A_0A_k - A_{200}A_k right| - A_0O ] The goal is to find (k) such that (d_k) is minimized. 5. **Monotonicity and Determining the Optimal (n):** Since (A_0A_n) decreases monotonically and (A_{200}A_n) increases monotonically as (n) varies from 1 to 200, the difference (A_0A_n - A_{200}A_n) is also monotonic. 6. **Setting Up the Necessary Condition:** We need to find (n) such that: [ left| d_{n+1} right| geq left| d_n right| quad text{and} quad left| d_{n-1} right| geq left| d_n right| ] 7. **Symmetry and Simplification:** The property that (d_k) has the same behavior for (k) and (200 - k), allows us to focus the calculations on finding a suitable (B) on the circumscribed circle such that (left| A_0B - A_{200}B right|) equals (A_0O). 8. **Solving the Equations for (B):** Consider (B) such that: [ left| A_0B - A_{200}B right| = frac{A_0A_{200}}{2} ] Transform this into a tangent function relation: [ frac{A_0B}{A_{200}B} = tanbeta ] Solving: [ tan^2 beta - frac{8}{3} tan beta + 1 = 0 quad Rightarrow quad tan beta = frac{4 pm sqrt{7}}{3} ] This gives: [ beta approx 65^circ 42^prime quad text{and} quad 24^circ 18^prime ] 9. **Determining the Vertices:** Due to (angle A_0OA_1 = 360^circ / 400 = 0^circ 54^prime), compute: [ frac{131^circ 24^prime}{0^circ 54^prime} approx 146 quad (text{rounded}), quad frac{48^circ 36^prime}{0^circ 54^prime} approx 54 quad (text{rounded}) ] Therefore, (B) points correspond to vertices near (A_{146}) and (A_{54}). 10. **Final Calibration and Confirmation:** Compare the deviations: [ left|d_{54}right| approx left|d_{146}right| = 0.0001 ] Checks with: [ left|d_{53}right| = 0.0102, quad left|d_{55}right| = 0.0105 ] Determines optimal (n) values. # Conclusion: The diagonals that minimize the absolute difference, subject to the defined criteria, are (A_0A_{54}, A_0A_{146}, A_0A_{254}), and (A_0A_{346}).

In that case, the statement is trivially true as having no such elements means there are at most ( phi(d) ) such elements (i.e., zero elements satisfy the claim). 3. **Existence of Elements of Order ( d )**: - Assume that there exist elements of order ( d ) modulo ( p ), and let ( y ) be such an element. - Any element of order ( d ) modulo ( p ) must be a root of the polynomial ( P(X) = X^d - 1 ), which has at most ( d ) roots. 4. **Structure of Roots**: - The elements ( y, y^2, ldots, y^{d-1} ) are distinct roots of ( P(X) = X^d - 1 ) because ( y ) itself is an element of order ( d ). - Therefore, all elements of order ( d ) must be among these powers of ( y ). 5. **Reduction by GCD Consideration**: - If ( k ) is not coprime with ( d ), then ( y^k ) has an order that divides ( frac{d}{gcd(d, k)} ) which is strictly less than ( d ). Thus, for ( y^k ) to have order ( d ), ( k ) must be coprime with ( d ). 6. **Counting Elements of Order ( d )**: - Number of such ( k )'s for which ( gcd(d, k) = 1 ) is given by Euler's totient function ( phi(d) ). - Hence, the number of elements of order ( d ) is at most ( phi(d) ). 7. **Uniqueness of Element of Order ( p-1 )**: - Suppose there is no element of order ( p-1 ). By Fermat's little theorem, every element in the multiplicative group of integers modulo ( p ) has an order which is a divisor of ( p-1 ). - The total number of invertible elements modulo ( p ) corresponds to the number of such positions, bounded above by ( sum_{d mid p-1, d neq p-1} phi(d) ). 8. **Contradiction Argument**: - Using the property ( sum_{d mid k} phi(d) = k ), we can affirm ( sum_{d mid p-1} phi(d) = p-1 ). - Subtract ( phi(p-1) ) to obtain: [ sum_{d mid p-1, d neq p-1} phi(d) = (p-1) - phi(p-1) ] - This total is strictly less than ( p-1 ), contradicting the fact that there are ( p-1 ) invertible elements. 9. **Conclusion**: - This contradiction shows that there must exist at least one element of order ( p-1 ) modulo ( p ).

This allows us to combine the two cube roots: [ P = left[ sqrt[3]{6} times sqrt[3]{frac{1}{162}} right]^{-1} = left[ sqrt[3]{6 times frac{1}{162}} right]^{-1} ] 3. Simplify the product inside the cube root: [ 6 times frac{1}{162} = frac{6}{162} ] 4. Reduce the fraction ( frac{6}{162} ): [ frac{6}{162} = frac{6 div 6}{162 div 6} = frac{1}{27} ] 5.

Therefore, if ( x(x+1) ) were a perfect ( n )-th power, its prime factorization would need each prime power to be a multiple of ( n ). 3. **Consecutive Integers Property:** Note that ( x ) and ( x+1 ) are consecutive integers. 4. **Common Divisors:** Two consecutive integers ( x ) and ( x+1 ) have no common prime factors. This is because any common divisor of ( x ) and ( x+1 ) would have to divide their difference, which is 1, implying the only common factor is 1. Therefore, the greatest common divisor ( gcd(x, x+1) = 1 ). 5. **Prime Factorization of the Product:** Since ( x ) and ( x+1 ) are coprime, the primes in the factorization of ( x(x+1) ) appear separately in the factorization of ( x ) and ( x+1 ). 6. **Exponent Conditions:** For the product ( x(x+1) ) to be a perfect ( n )-th power, every prime factor of ( x(x+1) ) would need to appear to a multiple of ( n ) in the factorization, i.e., for every prime ( p ), the exponent ( k ) in ( p^k ) should be divisible by ( n ). 7. **Infeasibility for Exponents:** Given ( x ) and ( x+1 ) are coprime and have distinct prime factor sets, it follows that the exponents from ( x cdot (x+1) ): [ x = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} ldots quad text{and} quad x+1 = q_1^{f_1} q_2^{f_2} ldots ] must result in exponents for each prime factor which are not necessarily multiples of ( n ) unless both ( x ) and ( x+1 ) are already perfect ( n )-th powers themselves, which leads to contradiction. 8. **Contradiction Proof:** It is impossible for ( x ) and ( x+1 ) to both be perfect ( n )-th powers because two consecutive numbers cannot both end with digits that conform to the format ( a^n ) and ( (a+1)^n ). Hence, no two consecutive integers are each other's perfect ( n )-th power, and consequently, ( x(x+1) ) cannot be a perfect ( n )-th power either. # Conclusion: Therefore, the product of two consecutive integers is never a perfect power. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given 2^{x}=3^{y}=36, which of the following statements is correct?

Now, we proceed to analyze the given statements: **For Option A:** We need to check if xy = 2(x + y). Using the properties of logarithms: 1. frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} = log_{36}2 + log_{36}3 = log_{36}6 = frac{1}{2}. 2. Therefore, frac{x+y}{xy} = frac{1}{2}, which simplifies to xy = 2(x + y). Hence, Option A is correct. **For Option B:** We use the basic inequality frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} > 2sqrt{frac{1}{x} cdot frac{1}{y}}: 1. Given frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} = frac{1}{2}, we find that frac{1}{2} > 2sqrt{frac{1}{xy}}. 2. Simplifying gives xy > 16. Thus, Option B is also correct. **For Option C:** To find x + y, we use the given x = log_{2}36 and y = log_{3}36: 1. x + y = 2log_{2}6 + 2log_{3}6 = 2(1 + log_{2}3 + 1 + frac{1}{log_{2}3}). 2. Since frac{3}{2} < log_{2}3 < 2, the function f(x) = x + frac{1}{x} is monotonically increasing in (frac{3}{2}, 2), implying log_{2}3 + frac{1}{log_{2}3} < 2 + frac{1}{2} = frac{5}{2}. 3.

Option C is correct. **For Option D:** We analyze x^{2} + y^{2} given x > 5 and y > 3: 1. x = 2(1 + log_{2}3) > 5 implies x^{2} > 25. 2. y = 2(1 + log_{3}2) > 3 implies y^{2} > 9. 3.

Rearrange the equation above to solve for ( z ): [ z = frac{36y + 3}{7} ] Rewriting ( z ) in terms of ( y ) gives: [ z = 36y + 3 = 7(5y + frac{y + 3}{7}) = 5y + (y + 3)/7 ] For this ( z ) to be an integer, ( frac{y+3}{7} ) must also be an integer, so let: [ u = frac{y+3}{7} ] 6.

According to the information given: - 1/4 of the passengers are from North America, so that's (1/4)P. - 1/8 of the passengers are Europeans, so that's (1/8)P. - 1/12 of the passengers are from Africa, so that's (1/12)P. - 1/6 of the passengers are from Asia, so that's (1/6)P. - The remaining passengers, which are 36 in number, are from other continents. To find the total number of passengers, we need to add up all these parts. But first, let's find a common denominator to combine these fractions. The least common multiple (LCM) of 4, 8, 12, and 6 is 24. So we will use 24 as our common denominator. Now, let's express each fraction with the common denominator of 24: - (1/4)P becomes (6/24)P because 4 * 6 = 24. - (1/8)P becomes (3/24)P because 8 * 3 = 24. - (1/12)P becomes (2/24)P because 12 * 2 = 24. - (1/6)P becomes (4/24)P because 6 * 4 = 24. Now, let's add these fractions: (6/24)P + (3/24)P + (2/24)P + (4/24)P = (15/24)P This means that 15 out of 24 parts of the passengers are from North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. The remaining passengers are from other continents, and we know there are 36 of them. So, the remaining passengers are: (24/24)P - (15/24)P = (9/24)P Since (9/24)P is equal to 36 (the passengers from other continents), we can write: (9/24)P = 36 To find P, we solve for P: P = 36 * (24/9) P = 36 * (8/3) P = 12 * 8 P = 96 Therefore, there are boxed{96} passengers on board the ship."},{"prompt":"Five identically appearing stones have different masses.

If she hikes for 4 hours, she would cover: 11 miles/hour * 4 hours = 44 miles Now, let's consider the effect of blisters. Since Candace gets 1 blister after every 2 hours in her new shoes, during a 4-hour hike, she would get: 4 hours / 2 hours/blister = 2 blisters These blisters will slow her down, but we don't know by how much yet. Let's assume each blister slows her down by \\"x\\" miles per hour. After the first 2 hours, she would have covered: 11 miles/hour * 2 hours = 22 miles After getting the first blister, her speed would be reduced to: 11 miles/hour - x miles/hour In the next 2 hours, with the reduced speed, she would cover: (11 - x) miles/hour * 2 hours = 22 - 2x miles So, the total distance covered in 4 hours with the new shoes and 2 blisters would be: 22 miles (first 2 hours) + (22 - 2x) miles (next 2 hours) We know that the total distance covered with the new shoes should be the same as with the old shoes, which is 24 miles. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 22 + (22 - 2x) = 24 Simplifying the equation: 44 - 2x = 24 Now, let's solve for \\"x\\": -2x = 24 - 44 -2x = -20 Divide both sides by -2 to find the value of \\"x\\": x = -20 / -2 x = 10 Each blister slows Candace down by boxed{10} miles per hour."},{"prompt":"Find the domain of the function y=ln (frac{1}{x}1).

For the natural logarithm ln(u) to be defined, we need its argument u>0. In our case, u=frac{1}{x}-1. 3. So, we must have frac{1}{x}-1>0. Adding 1 to both sides, we get frac{1}{x}>1. 4. Multiplying both sides by x is a bit tricky. We need to consider two cases: a. If x>0, then multiplying both sides by x gives 1<x. b.

We assume that ( A ) can be represented as a sum of two natural numbers ( B ) and ( C ), where the sum of the digits of ( B ) and ( C ) are equal. Let: [ A = B + C ] 3. Let's examine the last digits of ( B ) and ( C ). Since the last digit of ( A ) is 9, one possible case is that the sum of the last digits of ( B ) and ( C ) is 9 with no carry over. The pairs of digits (from 0 to 9) that add up to 9 are: [ (0, 9), (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 5), (5, 4), (6, 3), (7, 2), (8, 1), (9, 0) ] 4. If there were a carry involved while adding the digits, the sum would exceed 9, but since our number ( A ) has all 9 digits, there can't be a carry in any position. Therefore, in each digit's place, ( B ) and ( C ) must sum up to 9. 5. Now consider the sum of the digits of numbers ( B ) and ( C ). Let ( S(B) ) and ( S(C) ) denote the sum of the digits of ( B ) and ( C ) respectively. Since every pair of corresponding digits from ( B ) and ( C ) sum to 9 and there are 9 digits: [ S(B) + S(C) = 9 cdot 9 = 81 ] 6.

Step 1: Divisibility by 8 A number is divisible by 8 if its last three digits form a number which is divisible by 8. Therefore, we must ensure that the number (79b) (the last three digits of (a679b)) is divisible by 8. - Let's test different values for (b) from 0 to 9 to identify which makes (79b) divisible by 8.

So we can write the equation: Kendra's fish + Ken's fish = Total fish K + (2K - 3) = 87 Combining like terms, we get: 3K - 3 = 87 Now, we add 3 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with K: 3K - 3 + 3 = 87 + 3 3K = 90 Finally, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for K: 3K / 3 = 90 / 3 K = 30 Kendra caught boxed{30} fish."},{"prompt":"Find the length of the major axis of the ellipse dfrac{x^2}{9} + dfrac{y^2}{4} = 1.","completion":"The major axis of an ellipse in the standard form dfrac{x^2}{a^2} + dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 has a length of 2a. 1.

First Solution: 1. **Inradius and Incircle Contact Points**: Let (O) be the incenter of triangle (ABC) and (rho) be the inradius. If (A_1) is the point where the incircle touches (BC), then the length (a_1) is given by: [ a_1 = 2rho cos frac{alpha}{2} ] 2. **Triangle Area and Semiperimeter**: Let (t) denote the area of triangle (ABC), and (s) its semiperimeter ((s = frac{a+b+c}{2})).

This implies that temperature is the independent variable and the speed of sound is the dependent variable, as the speed of sound changes in response to temperature changes. - Therefore, the statement that the independent variable is temperature, and the speed of sound is a function of temperature, is correct. **Statement B:** - By examining the data, we see that as the temperature increases from -20^circ C to 30^circ C, the speed of sound increases from 318 m/s to 348 m/s. This indicates a direct relationship where the lower the temperature, the slower the speed of sound. - Thus, this statement is correct. **Statement C:** - Calculating the difference in the speed of sound for every 10^circ C increase in temperature: - From -20^circ C to -10^circ C: 324 m/s - 318 m/s = 6 m/s - From -10^circ C to 0^circ C: 330 m/s - 324 m/s = 6 m/s - From 0^circ C to 10^circ C: 336 m/s - 330 m/s = 6 m/s - From 10^circ C to 20^circ C: 342 m/s - 336 m/s = 6 m/s - From 20^circ C to 30^circ C: 348 m/s - 342 m/s = 6 m/s - This consistently shows that with every 10^circ C increase in temperature, the speed of sound increases by 6 m/s.

We are given that half the area of the square is painted, so the painted area is frac{s^2}{2}. Step 1: Analyze the geometry The brush sweeps along both diagonals of the square. Each diagonal divides the square into two equal isosceles right triangles. The brush, having width w, paints a band along each diagonal. The intersection of these bands forms a square at the center, and the remaining parts of the bands form four right triangles at the corners of the square. Step 2: Calculate the area of the painted region The area of the painted region consists of: - The central square, with side length w (since the width of the brush is w and it is swept along the diagonals, the intersection forms a square). - Four right triangles, each with legs equal to frac{s-w}{2} (since the total side length is s, and the central square occupies w, the remaining length on each side of the square is s-w, divided by 2 because it is split between two triangles). The area of the central square is w^2. The area of one of the right triangles is frac{1}{2} left(frac{s-w}{2}right)^2. Since there are four such triangles, their total area is 4 times frac{1}{2} left(frac{s-w}{2}right)^2 = 2 left(frac{s-w}{2}right)^2 = frac{(s-w)^2}{2}. Step 3: Set up the equation The total painted area is the sum of the area of the central square and the areas of the four triangles: w^2 + frac{(s-w)^2}{2} = frac{s^2}{2} Step 4: Solve the equation Expanding and simplifying the equation: w^2 + frac{s^2 - 2sw + w^2}{2} = frac{s^2}{2} 2w^2 + s^2 - 2sw + w^2 = s^2 3w^2 - 2sw = 0 w(3w - 2s) = 0 Since w neq 0, we have: 3w = 2s frac{s}{w} = frac{3}{2} Step 5: Conclusion The ratio of the side length of the square to the brush width is boxed{frac{3}{2}}.

Let's denote the birds on the circle as ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_9 ) and the bird outside the circle as ( B ). - For any 5 birds chosen from the 10, there are two cases: - Case 1: All 5 birds are chosen from ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_9 ). Since these birds are already on the circle, at least 4 of them will lie on the circle. - Case 2: The chosen 5 birds include the bird ( B ) and 4 birds from ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_9 ). In this case, the 4 birds from ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_9 ) are already on the circle.

If points P and Q have a distance of 1, they must be diametrically opposite. Thus, P and Q are on the disk's boundary and must lie in different semicircles, ensuring they are colored differently. 4. **Case for r > frac{1}{2}:** We now show that a disk with radius r > frac{1}{2} is not 2-colorable. - Consider a regular (2k+1)-gon inscribed in a circle with radius r, such that one of its diagonals is of unit length.

However, the polygon has an odd number of vertices, which makes it impossible for all adjacents to have different colors. 5. **Calculate the Radius varrho_k:** The radius varrho_k of the circle circumscribing the (2k+1)-gon with sides of unit length can be derived as follows: - Let O be the center of the circle, and A_1 A_{k+1} = 1 be one of the diagonals. - Drop a perpendicular from O to A_1 A_{k+1}, intersecting at point T. Using right triangle A_1TO: [ frac{A_1 T}{A_1 O} = sin left( frac{k pi}{2k+1} right) ] Given A_1T = frac{1}{2} and A_1O = varrho_k: [ varrho_k = frac{frac{1}{2}}{sin left( frac{k pi}{2k+1} right)} = frac{1}{2 sin left( frac{k pi}{2k+1} right)} ] From the sine addition formula and properties of sin and cos: [ sin left( frac{k pi}{2k+1} right) = cos left( frac{pi}{4k+2} right) ] This sequence increases with k and tends to 1, implying varrho_k is a monotonically decreasing sequence approaching frac{1}{2}. 6. **Non-2-colorability for r > frac{1}{2}:** For any r > frac{1}{2}, there exists a k such that r > varrho_k. Therefore, such a disk cannot be 2-colorable as it would contain a (2k+1)-gon that disallows a valid 2-coloring. **Conclusion:** Disks with radius larger than frac{1}{2} are not 2-colorable, while those with radius at most frac{1}{2} are. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"a class, some students like to play basketball and 8 like to play cricket. 3 students like to play both basketball and cricket.

These intervals are determined by the roots of the quadratic equation (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0, which are x = 3 and x = -1. Now, we will test the sign of each interval formed by the roots: - For x < -1, the expression (x - 3)(x + 1) is positive because both factors are negative. - For -1 leq x leq 3, the expression is negative because the first factor is negative and the second factor is positive. - For x > 3, the expression is again positive since both factors are positive.

The interval [-4, 4] represents the sample space and has a length of 4 - (-4) = 8. The probability P that a randomly chosen x_0 satisfies f(x_0) leq 0 is the ratio of the length of the favorable interval to the length of the entire interval: P = frac{text{Length of favorable interval}}{text{Length of sample space interval}} = frac{3 - (-1)}{4 - (-4)} = frac{4}{8} = frac{1}{2}.

Perimeter of the room (excluding ceiling and floor) = 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (25 feet + 15 feet) = 2 * 40 feet = 80 feet Now, multiply the perimeter by the height of the room to get the total wall area: Total wall area = Perimeter * Height = 80 feet * 12 feet = 960 square feet Next, we need to calculate the area of the door and the three windows to subtract from the total wall area. Area of the door = Height of door * Width of door = 6 feet * 3 feet = 18 square feet Area of one window = Height of window * Width of window = 4 feet * 3 feet = 12 square feet Since there are three windows, we multiply the area of one window by 3: Total area of three windows = 12 square feet * 3 = 36 square feet Now, subtract the area of the door and windows from the total wall area: Adjusted wall area = Total wall area - Area of door - Area of windows = 960 square feet - 18 square feet - 36 square feet = 960 square feet - 54 square feet = 906 square feet Finally, we calculate the cost of white washing the adjusted wall area at Rs. 7 per square foot: Cost = Adjusted wall area * Cost per square foot = 906 square feet * Rs. 7 per square foot = Rs. 6342 Therefore, the cost of white washing the four walls of the room, after accounting for the door and windows, is Rs. boxed{6342} ."},{"prompt":"Jan was given two tasks in her mathematics class.

The problem states that a line passing through the centers of two circles, one inscribed around a lateral face and the other around the largest diagonal section, intersects with a base edge. Our goal is to find the dihedral angle at the base. 1. **Understanding the Geometry**: - The regular hexagonal base of the pyramid implies each side of the hexagon is equal, and all internal angles within the hexagon are 120^circ. - The pyramid's apex is equidistant from all vertices of the hexagon base due to its regularity. 2. **Centers of the Circles**: - The center of the circle inscribed around the lateral face (a triangle) involving the apex and two adjacent base vertices is found at the centroid of this triangle. - The largest diagonal section is a plane passing through the apex and dividing the hexagon into two equal parts. Therefore, the center of the inscribed circle of this diagonal section is located at the centroid of the section. 3. **Intersection Point**: - The intersecting line mentioned passes through these two centroids. - As this line intersects a base side, we analyze a cross-sectional interaction involving the geometry of the large diagonal section and the lateral section on a two-dimensional plane. 4. **Dihedral Angle**: - The dihedral angle at the base, varphi, involves the angle between the plane of the hexagonal base and a lateral face. 5. **Calculations**: - Recall that the lateral faces of the pyramid are isosceles triangles. The angle between such a triangle and the base defines our required dihedral angle. - Considering the triangle formed by two radius vectors from the apex through two adjacent vertices of the base, we need to find cos(varphi) involving the vertical height of the pyramid and the side lengths. 6. **Application of Trigonometry**: - Let ( h ) be the height of the pyramid and ( a ) be the side length of the base hexagon. The height of a lateral face from the apex to the center of a base side is critical. - Using the centroid formula and vector interpretations: [ cos(varphi) = frac{text{Projection of lateral height on base}}{text{Lateral height}} ] - Detailed vector analysis, triangular relationships, or trigonometric identities are applied to solve the exact cos(varphi) value. 7. **Final Calculation and Simplification**: - Utilize the spatial coordinates or geometric properties to solve for cos(varphi).

As V is the centroid, and in an isosceles right triangle the median to the hypotenuse is also the altitude and coincides with one of the axes (either x-axis or y-axis), we can assume without loss of generality that A and B are symmetric about one of these axes. We assume that A(a, frac{1}{a}) and B(-a, -frac{1}{a}) for some a neq 0. The coordinates of these points satisfy the hyperbola equation xy = 1 and are symmetric about the origin.

We find the possible values of (d) that satisfy these conditions. 2. **Applying the inequalities**: - From (a + b + c > d): [ 5 + 10 + 20 > d implies 35 > d ] - From (b + c + d > a), this is always true since (b + c = 30 > 5). - From (a + c + d > b), this is always true since (a + c = 25 > 10). - From (a + b + d > c): [ 5 + 10 + d > 20 implies d > 5 ] Combining these, the valid range for (d) is: [ 5 < d < 35 ] 3. **Counting the valid rods**: - The integers that satisfy (5 < d < 35) are (6, 7, 8, ldots, 34).

So: [ (2-sqrt{5}) + (2+sqrt{5}) + 1 + 3n = -a implies 5 + 3n = -a ] Since ( a ) is rational and known, ( n ) must be an integer such that ( 3n ) is also rational and an integer, which it always is. - Also, the sum of the product of roots taken three at a time is ( -c ).

To understand its behavior, we find its derivative: [f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 1.] Analyzing f'(x), we can determine the intervals where f(x) is increasing or decreasing: - For f'(x) < 0, we have 0 < x < 1, indicating f(x) is decreasing in this interval. - For f'(x) > 0, we have x > 1, indicating f(x) is increasing in this interval. Since f(x) is decreasing for 0 < x < 1 and increasing for x > 1, and considering f(1) = 0, it follows that for any x > 0, f(x) leq f(1) = 0. This implies ln x leq x - 1 for all x > 0. Specifically, for x > 0 and x neq 1, we have ln x < x - 1. **Step 2: Compare a and b.** Given a = e^{0.11} and b = 1.1^{1.1}, we apply the inequality proven above: [1.1 ln 1.1 < 1.1 times (1.1 - 1) = 0.11.] Since a = e^{0.11}, and knowing that e^x is a strictly increasing function, we conclude that a > b. **Step 3: Compare b and c.** Define a function g(x) = (1 + x)^{1.1} - (1.1x + 1). We want to analyze g(x) for x = 0.1: [g(0.1) = 1.1[(1 + 0.1)^{0.1} - 1].] Since (1 + x)^{0.1} is monotonically increasing for x > 0, we have: [g(0.1) = 1.1^{1.1} - 1.11 > 0,] which implies b > c. **Conclusion:** Combining the results from Steps 2 and 3, we have established that a > b > c.

Next, using the formula for an arithmetic sequence, we can write a_5 = a_1 + 4d = -11 + 4d. Solving for the common difference d, we obtain d = 2. Now, we can express the n-th term of the sequence as a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = -11 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 13. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}. Substituting our expressions for a_1 and a_n into this formula, we obtain S_n = frac{n(-11 + 2n - 13)}{2} = n^2 - 12n.

We will start by cutting this triangle into three similar triangles through lines AX, BX, and CX, where X is some point inside the triangle. 2. **Angles Calculation**: The angles at point X must satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, the angles angle AXB, angle AXC, and angle BXC must all be equal since AX, BX, and CX divide triangle ABC into three similar triangles. - Therefore, angle AXB = angle AXC = angle BXC = 120^circ because: [ angle AXB > angle ACB ] and the total sum of angles around a point is 360^circ. 3. **Equilateral Triangle Condition**: - Since each of the resulting angles is 120^circ, the point X must be equidistant from vertices A, B, and C. - This implies that the triangle ABC must be equilateral to satisfy the condition: [ AX = BX = CX ] 4. **Dividing into Similar Triangles**: Next, consider dividing the equilateral triangle ABC further: - An equilateral triangle can now be repeatedly divided by lines passing through the vertices. For instance, cut it initially with one line passing through from one vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side, resulting in two smaller similar triangles. - This process can be repeated recursively for creating any required number of similar triangles. **Generalization**: - Let us start by cutting the triangle initially into two similar triangles by a line. Choose one of these triangles and cut it again into two more similar triangles. Since at each step the triangles created are similar to each other, this process can be repeated to create any number of similar triangles. 5. **Conclusion**: By induction or recursive cutting, starting from one equilateral or isosceles triangle and cutting further any number of times while preserving the similarity, we prove that any triangle can be subdivided into any number of similar triangles.

Translating this to our tangent line, where (x_1, y_1) corresponds to (x, f(x)) and m = f'(x), we get: y - f(x) = f'(x)(x - x) Simplifying, we see that the term f'(x)(x - x) equals zero because any number times zero is zero: y - f(x) = 0 Thus, the equation of the tangent line simply becomes: y = f(x) However, the conventional representation of the tangent line's equation at point x would incorporate the derivative, which can be reintroduced like this: y = f(x) + f'(x)(x - x) which simplifies to the aforementioned y = f(x).

Then, we have: [ f^{f(a)}(b) = f^{f(b)}(a) ] Since f(a) = f(b), this implies: [ f^{f(a)}(b) = f^{f(a)}(a) ] By the definition of Delta(m,n), this would mean: [ Delta(a, b) = f^{f(a)}(b) - f^{f(b)}(a) = 0 ] However, we are given that Delta(m,n) neq 0 for any distinct m, n in mathbb{N}. Therefore, a = b. Hence, f is injective. blacksquare 2. **Lemma 2: For any n, if f^i(n) = f^j(n), then i = j.** *Proof*: Suppose f^i(n) = f^j(n) for some i neq j. Then, the set S = {f^k(n)} must be finite. By assumption, for all m, f^{f(n)}(m) is within N of some element of S, and there are only finitely many such numbers. Thus, there exist some m_1 neq m_2 with: [ f^{f(n)}(m_1) = f^{f(n)}(m_2) ] By injectivity of f, we must have m_1 = m_2, which is a contradiction. Thus, our assumption was wrong, so i = j. blacksquare 3. **Lemma 3: There are at most 2N+1 chains.** *Proof*: Assume there were at least 2N+2 chains, and let m_1, dots, m_k be numbers in distinct chains. Let B > max{f(m_1), dots, f(m_k)}, and let m = m_i, n = f^{B-f(m_i)}(n) in the boundedness condition. We get: [ left| f^B(n) - f^{f^{B-f(m_i)+1}(n)}(m_i) right| leq N ] Thus, the chain with m_i must intersect [f^B(n)-N, f^B(n)+N], which has 2N+1 elements. Thus, if there were 2N+2 distinct chains, two chains would meet in this set, which would imply they were the same chain, which is a contradiction. Thus, there are at most 2N+1 chains. blacksquare 4. **Lemma 4: There is only one chain, and it only extends infinitely in one direction.** *Proof*: Fix some integer c. I claim that all but finitely many numbers are ahead of c in its chain (are of the form f^k(c) with k geq 1). Call a number *bad* if it is not of this form. Note that as n varies, f^{f(c)}(n) achieves all sufficiently large integers, since there are only finitely many chains. Thus, if A, B are sufficiently large integers, every value in [A, B] is achieved as f^{f(c)}(n). But then f^{f(n)}(c) in [A-N, B+N] for all such n, and these values are all distinct, since f^{f(n)}(c) = f^{f(m)}(c) implies f(n) = f(m) implies n = m. Thus, for all sufficiently large A, B, the interval [A-N, B+N] contains at least B-A+1 numbers of the form f^{f(n)}(c), so there are at most 2N bad numbers in this interval. But if there were infinitely many bad numbers, then for some large A, B, [A-N, B+N] would contain at least 2N+1 such numbers, which is a contradiction. Thus, there are only finitely many bad numbers. Now, if there were at least 2 chains, the chain without c would have infinitely many bad numbers. Similarly, if the chain with c extended infinitely in both directions, then there would also be infinitely many bad numbers (every number of the form f^{-k}(c)). Thus, there is exactly one chain and it only extends infinitely in one direction. blacksquare 5. **Lemma 5: For all M, there exists an integer x with g(x) leq x - M.** *Proof*: Assume not, so g(x) - x is bounded below. But g(x) - x is injective by above (assuming x geq 1), so for any K, there exists B such that g(x) - x geq K for all x geq B. But then {g(B+1), g(B+2), dots} subseteq [B+K, infty), while {g(0), dots, g(B)} only achieves B+1 values. Thus, at least K-1 values are not achieved by g, which is a contradiction. Thus, g(x) - x is not bounded below. blacksquare Now pick B such that g(B) + N leq B. By setting b = B - g(a+1), we get: [ |g(B) - g(g(B+1-g(a+1)) + a)| leq N ] for all a with g(a+1) leq B. Let t = max{g^{-1}(g(B)-N), g^{-1}(g(B)-N+1), dots, g^{-1}(g(B)+N)}. Note that g(t) leq g(B) + N leq B and t geq 1, so setting a = t-1, we have g(a+1) leq B, so we can plug in a to get: [ |g(B) - g(t-1 + g(B+1-g(t)))| leq N ] Thus, t-1 + g(B+1-g(t)) in {g^{-1}(g(B)-N), dots, g^{-1}(g(B)+N)}. But t was the maximum such element, which means g(B+1-g(t)) = 1, or B+1-g(t) = g^{-1}(1). Since |g(t) - g(B)| leq N, we have |(B-g(B)) + 1 - g^{-1}(1)| leq N. Thus, there are only finitely many values for B - g(B). But there are infinitely many B with g(B) + N leq B by Lemma 5, which is a contradiction since g(x) - x is injective.

Traffic delays may also lead to longer ride times, which can increase charges at a rate of 0.15 per minute. The company also offers a 10% discount for senior citizens or rides during nonpeak hours. Considering all these factors, calculate the total cost of a taxi ride for a senior citizen that was 8 miles long, included 12 minutes of waiting time, 25 minutes of traffic delays, passed through a toll route, and took place during nonpeak hours. Remember to include a 15% tip for the driver.","completion":"First, let's calculate the cost of the distance traveled. The first 1/5 of a mile costs 2.50. Since the ride was 8 miles long, we need to calculate the cost for the remaining distance after the first 1/5 mile. 8 miles = 40/5 miles (since there are 5 fifths in a mile) The cost for the first 1/5 mile is already covered, so we need to calculate the cost for the remaining 39/5 miles. Each additional 1/5 mile costs 0.40, so for 39/5 miles, the cost would be: 39/5 * 0.40 = 7.80 Now, let's add the initial 2.50 for the first 1/5 mile: 7.80 + 2.50 = 10.30 Next, we calculate the waiting time cost: 12 minutes * 0.25/minute = 3.00 Now, let's calculate the cost of traffic delays: 25 minutes * 0.15/minute = 3.75 The toll fee is a flat rate: 3.00 Now, let's sum up all the costs so far: Distance cost: 10.30 Waiting time cost: 3.00 Traffic delay cost: 3.75 Toll fee: 3.00 Total cost before discounts and surge pricing: 10.30 + 3.00 + 3.75 + 3.00 = 20.05 Since the ride took place during non-peak hours and the passenger is a senior citizen, they are eligible for a 10% discount. Let's calculate the discounted amount: 10% of 20.05 = 0.10 * 20.05 = 2.005 Now, let's subtract the discount from the total cost: 20.05 - 2.005 = 18.045 Since we can't charge fractions of a cent, we'll round this to the nearest cent, which is 18.05. Finally, we need to calculate the 15% tip for the driver: 15% of 18.05 = 0.15 * 18.05 = 2.7075 Again, rounding to the nearest cent, the tip would be 2.71. Now, let's add the tip to the total cost after the discount: 18.05 + 2.71 = 20.76 Therefore, the total cost of the taxi ride for the senior citizen, including the tip, would be boxed{20.76} ."},{"prompt":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a_1=2 and a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 12, (1) Find the general term formula for the sequence {a_n}; (2) Let b_n = 3^{frac {a_n}{2}}, find the formula for the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {b_n}.","completion":"(1) Let the common difference of the arithmetic sequence {a_n} be d.

Let's denote the cell at row (i) and column (j) by (A(i, j)), and the number in cell (A(i, j)) by (a_{ij}). 2. We first prove that no matter how the numbers are placed, there must exist two adjacent cells with a difference of at least (n). - Suppose that in any two adjacent cells, the difference between the numbers is at most (n-1). - Consider the maximum numbers in each row and column.

Secondly, we can arrange the numbers in such a way that (g = n): - Set (a_{ij} = n(i-1) + j) for (1 leq i, j leq n).

We are given that after hiring the additional male workers, the total number of employees is 264. Therefore, we can write: E + M = 264 We also know that the number of female workers remained the same before and after hiring the additional male workers, so we can set the two expressions for the number of female workers equal to each other: 0.60E = 0.55(E + M) Now we have a system of two equations: 1) E + M = 264 2) 0.60E = 0.55(E + M) Let's solve the second equation for E: 0.60E = 0.55E + 0.55M 0.60E - 0.55E = 0.55M 0.05E = 0.55M Now, let's divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for E: E = (0.55M) / 0.05 E = 11M Now we can substitute E = 11M into the first equation: 11M + M = 264 12M = 264 Divide both sides by 12 to solve for M: M = 264 / 12 M = 22 So, the company hired boxed{22} additional male workers."},{"prompt":"Given a convex polyhedron F .

It appears that the number of nice colourings is not divisible by 5 . Prove that there is a nice colouring, in which some three consecutive edges from A are coloured the same way. *D. Karpov*","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** - We have a convex polyhedron ( F ) with a vertex ( A ) of degree 5, and all other vertices have degree 3. - A \\"nice\\" coloring of the edges is defined such that for any vertex except ( A ), all three edges incident to it have different colors. - We need to prove that there exists a nice coloring where some three consecutive edges from ( A ) are colored the same way, given that the number of nice colorings is not divisible by 5. 2. **Initial Observations:** - Since ( A ) has degree 5, it is connected to 5 other vertices. - Each of these 5 edges can be colored in one of three colors, say 1, 2, and 3. - For any vertex other than ( A ), the three incident edges must all be different colors. 3. **Roads and Cycles:** - Consider starting from ( A ) and following a sequence of edges, alternating between two colors. For example, starting with an edge colored 1, we can follow a sequence like 1, 2, 1, 2, etc. - This sequence must eventually return to ( A ) because the polyhedron is finite and connected. 4. **Counting Roads:** - From each of the 5 edges incident to ( A ), there are two possible alternating sequences (e.g., 1-2 and 1-3 for an edge colored 1). - Since there are 5 edges, there are a total of 10 such sequences. - Each sequence must appear an even number of times because they must pair up to form closed loops. 5. **Contradiction Argument:** - Suppose no three consecutive edges from ( A ) are colored the same. - Consider the possible colorings of the 5 edges incident to ( A ). There are 5 cases to consider: 1. ( 1, 1, 2, 1, 3 ) 2. ( 1, 2, 1, 3, 1 ) 3. ( 1, 2, 1, 1, 3 ) 4. ( 2, 1, 3, 1, 1 ) 5. ( 2, 1, 1, 3, 1 ) 6. **Switching Colors:** - In any alternating sequence (e.g., 1-3), we can switch the two colors (e.g., 1, 3, 1, 3 becomes 3, 1, 3, 1) and still maintain a nice coloring. - This switching shows that each road uniquely connects two edges unless it results in three consecutive edges being the same color. 7. **Equal Distribution of Cases:** - If we assume that one of the cases appears more frequently than the others, we can use the switching argument to generate all other cases from it. - This implies that all 5 cases must appear the same number of times, leading to the conclusion that the number of nice colorings is divisible by 5. 8. **Contradiction:** - Given that the number of nice colorings is not divisible by 5, our assumption that no three consecutive edges from ( A ) are colored the same must be false. 9. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, there must exist a nice coloring where some three consecutive edges from ( A ) are colored the same way.

The number of ways to choose 3 numbers out of 3n for the first column is binom{3n}{3}. For the second column, we choose 3 numbers out of the remaining 3n-3 numbers, which is binom{3n-3}{3}, and so on. This process continues until we have chosen all n columns. The product of these binomial coefficients is: [ binom{3n}{3} binom{3n-3}{3} cdots binom{3}{3} ] 3. **Arranging Each Column:** Within each column, the 3 numbers must be in ascending order. There is only 1 way to arrange 3 numbers in ascending order. Therefore, for each column, there is only 1 way to arrange the numbers. 4. **Arranging Columns:** The n columns themselves can be arranged in any order. Since the order of the columns matters, we need to divide by n! to account for the different permutations of the columns. 5. **Combining the Factors:** Combining all these factors, we get the total number of tidy 3n-tables as: [ frac{(3n)!}{3!^n cdot n!} ] Here, 3!^n accounts for the fact that within each column, the 3 numbers can be arranged in 3! ways, but only 1 of these ways is valid (ascending order).

Let ( N ) be the point where the line ( KL ) intersects the altitude ( CH ), and let ( O ) be the center of the circle. 2. **Identifying Geometric Properties**: It is clear that ( KM ) is the diameter of the circle since these points are opposite to each other on the circle. Recognize that quadrilateral ( CHKM ) forms a rectangle, since ( CH ) is perpendicular to ( AB ) and tangent lines to a circle from a given point are perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. 3. **Establishing Equal Lengths**: The height ( CN ) of quadrilateral ( CHKM ) is equal to the diameter of the circle. Thus, it suffices to show that ( CN = OK ) because if this equality holds, ( N ) must bisect ( CH ). 4. **Bisector Confirmation**: Since ( CO ) is the bisector of angle ( C ) in the isosceles triangle ( LCM ) (having ( CL = CM )), we also know that ( CO ) is perpendicular to ( LM ). Additionally, line ( KL ) is perpendicular to ( LM ), reinforcing that (angle CLO = 90^circ ) and (angle KLO = 90^circ ).
