Next, we need to find Kelly's current age using the third equation: (R + 2) * (K + 2) = 108 (10 + 2) * (K + 2) = 108 12 * (K + 2) = 108 K + 2 = 108 / 12 K + 2 = 9 K = 7 Now we know Kelly's current age is 7. Finally, we can find the ratio of Roy's age difference with Julia to his age difference with Kelly: Roy's age difference with Julia: R - J = 10 - 4 = 6 Roy's age difference with Kelly: R - K = 10 - 7 = 3 The ratio of Roy's age difference with Julia to his age difference with Kelly is boxed{6:3,} which simplifies to 2:1."},{"prompt":"Given three propositions A, B, and C, if A is a necessary and sufficient condition for B, and C is a sufficient but not necessary condition for B, then C is a ______ for A.","completion":"1.

We need to find the maximum number of points such that no three are collinear and no triangle formed is obtuse. - For example, consider a regular polygon. In a regular polygon with more than 4 vertices, there will be obtuse angles. Hence, the maximum number of points in 2D is 4 (forming a square). 2. **Extending to 3D:** - In three dimensions, we need to find a configuration of points such that no three points are collinear and no triangle formed by any three points is obtuse. - Consider the vertices of a cube. A cube has 8 vertices, and no three vertices are collinear. Additionally, any triangle formed by the vertices of a cube is not obtuse because the angles between the edges of a cube are all ( frac{pi}{2} ) or ( frac{pi}{3} ). 3. **Verification for 8 Points:** - Let's verify if 8 points (vertices of a cube) satisfy the conditions: - No three points are collinear. - Any triangle formed by these points is not obtuse. - In a cube, the angles between any two edges meeting at a vertex are ( frac{pi}{2} ). The face diagonals form angles of ( frac{pi}{3} ) with the edges.

To show that ( G ) is k-connected: *Note*: Internally disjoint paths between two vertices mean paths that share no internal vertex (other than the endpoints). 2. If ( G ) has ( k ) internally disjoint paths between any two vertices ( u ) and ( v ), then the removal of fewer than ( k ) vertices cannot disconnect ( u ) and ( v ), because at least one of these paths would still remain intact. 3. Therefore, G cannot be disconnected by removing fewer than k vertices. Hence, ( G ) is k-connected. 4. **Conversely**, suppose that ( G ) is k-connected and contains more than ( k ) vertices. We need to show that any two vertices ( u ) and ( v ) in ( G ) are connected by ( k ) internally disjoint paths. 5. Assume to the contrary that there exists a pair of vertices ( u ) and ( v ) that are not connected by ( k ) internally disjoint paths. According to Menger's Theorem (3.3.5 (i)), the minimum vertex cut separating ( u ) and ( v ) would have fewer than ( k ) vertices. 6. Let ( S ) be a minimum vertex cut for ( u ) and ( v ) in ( G ). Then |S| le k-1. Remove S from ( G ). In the resulting graph ( G setminus S ), vertices ( u ) and ( v ) are in different components. 7. Since G is k-connected, removing any set of fewer than k vertices cannot disconnect the graph. Therefore, |S| ge k. 8. There is a contradiction because |S| le k-1. Therefore, there must exist ( k ) internally disjoint paths between ( u ) and ( v ). # Part (ii): A graph G is ( k )-edge-connected if and only if for any pair of vertices ( u, v in V(G) ), there exist ( k ) edge-disjoint paths connecting ( u ) and ( v ). **Proof:** The proof follows directly from Menger's Theorem (3.3.5 (ii)). This theorem states that a graph is ( k )-edge-connected if there are at least ( k ) edge-disjoint paths between every pair of vertices in the graph. 1. **Assume** ( G ) is ( k )-edge-connected. For every pair of vertices ( u ) and ( v ), there exist ( k ) edge-disjoint paths connecting ( u ) and ( v ): - If ( G ) is ( k )-edge-connected, removing fewer than ( k ) edges cannot disconnect ( u ) and ( v ). Hence, by definition, there exist ( k ) edge-disjoint paths between ( u ) and ( v ). 2. **Conversely**, suppose that for every pair of vertices ( u ) and ( v ) in ( G ), there are ( k ) edge-disjoint paths connecting them. We need to show that ( G ) is ( k )-edge connected: - The removal of fewer than ( k ) edges cannot disconnect ( u ) and ( v ) because there would still be an edge-disjoint path connecting them. Hence, ( G ) remains connected under the removal of fewer than ( k ) edges. 3.

One such property is that the segments from the vertex to the points of tangency are equal to the semiperimeter minus the corresponding side. 4. **Calculations of Distances**: Since the excircle touches AB at K and AC at L, and we know the perimeter of the triangle ABC is 2p, the tangential segments from A to these points of tangency are each p.

Let's proceed step-by-step. 1. **Identify Relationships and Use Triangle Properties:** Since (AD) is tangent to the circle at (D),: [ OD perp CD ] 2. **Find (OD):** Now, recall that (D) lies on the circle, hence, [ OD = R ] where (R) is the radius of the circle. However, we are not provided directly with (R). But we can proceed by leveraging the distances given. 3. **Using Coordinates Approach:** Consider (O) as origin with coordinates ((0, 0)). Assume (A) has coordinates ((a, b)). We are given that this point satisfies: [ sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2 ] 4. **Use Value (AB = 4):** If we now impose a coordinate system where (A) has coordinates ((2,0)), to simplify, and knowing (AB = 4), the distance formula gives: [ (B_x - 2)^2 + B_y^2 = 16 ] 5. **Utilize the value (BC = 3):** Given that (BC) is 3 for the point (B) having coordinates, extending this relation is crucial. 6. **Setup Triangle Coordinates:** We should then formulate a right triangle by (BC)'s length, [ C text{( } (c_x, c_y) text{ } ) ] It's then notable that the intersection and tangency point boosts the derived coordinates based upon initial points approximate radius relationships. 7. **Apply Pythagorean Theorem in (triangle OBC):** This forms the basis (OC), [ OC^2 = OC_x^2 + OC_y^2 = OD^2 + DO] [ OC^2 = O_x^2 + O_y^2 + (A_x + DO_x)^2 + (A_y + DO_y)^2 ] However, more simplistically: 8. **Determine Complete Distance:** Using integration, [ AB = 4 text{ in unit circle form, real subtraction/recalculation yields coordinates } approx -} inclusion x-offset altogether, [ OC's text{ results implying calculations } R^2 + form boxed{OC = 2sqrt{15}}"},{"prompt":"de a right triangle with sides 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm, there are two circles.

Find the radii of the circles.","completion":": 1. Let's define the radius of the two circles inside the right triangle with sides 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm (the hypotenuse). Suppose the radii of the circles are (4x) and (9x), respectively, since their radii are given in the ratio 9:4. 2. Based on the problem's description, the circles touch the hypotenuse and each touches one cathetus. This setup implies that both circles are externally tangent to each other. 3. Let’s denote the distance between the points where the two circles touch the hypotenuse as (y). 4. Applying the Pythagorean theorem in relation to the setup, the horizontal and vertical distances between the points where the circles touch the hypotenuse can be derived. - The combined radii along the hypotenuse is ((9x + 4x)). - The difference in radii along the perpendicular direction is ((9x - 4x)). Therefore, we have: [ (9x + 4x)^2 = (9x - 4x)^2 + y^2 ] Simplifying: [ (13x)^2 = (5x)^2 + y^2 ] [ 169x^2 = 25x^2 + y^2 ] Solving for (y): [ y^2 = 169x^2 - 25x^2 ] [ y^2 = 144x^2 ] So, [ y = 12x ] 5. Next, we use the tangent of half-angles of the angles in the triangle: [ tan left( frac{A}{2} right) = frac{1}{3}, quad tan left( frac{C}{2} right) = frac{1}{2} ] To find the hypotenuse through the tangent half-angle formula, let: [ AC = 42x ] 6. Using this, we solve for (x): [ x = frac{5}{42} ] However, checking the projection of point (M) on side (BC): [ frac{5 cdot 27}{42} = frac{135}{42} > 3 ] This implies that the projections exceed the sides of the triangle, making this configuration invalid. 7.

Set B is already given as B={x|-1 lt x lt 5}. The universal set U=mathbb{R} indicates all possible real numbers. To find complement _{U}A, we consider all elements not in A: - Since A consists of all x such that xgeqslant -m, the complement, complement _{U}A, consists of all x such that x lt -m. Given that (complement _{U}A)cap Bneq varnothing, there must be some elements common to both complement _{U}A and B: - This implies that the set of all x such that x lt -m has some elements in the range -1 lt x lt 5.

For frac{1}{n} and frac{1}{n+1} to be finite decimal fractions, n and n+1 must be such that their denominators (in their simplest forms) are products of powers of 2 and 5. 2. Therefore, for any n > 1, the conditions to satisfy are: [ n = 2^k cdot 5^l quad text{and} quad n+1 = 2^s cdot 5^t ] 3. Since n and n+1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime (i.e., (n, n+1) = 1). Thus, either 2^s cdot 5^t - 1 = 2^k cdot 5^l or 2^k cdot 5^l - 1 = 2^s cdot 5^t must hold true. # Case 1: 2^s cdot 5^t = 2^k cdot 5^l + 1 4. If we consider 2^s cdot 5^t = 2^k cdot 5^l + 1, then 2^s must end in 6 because it is one more than a number composed of factors of 2 and 5. Hence, s must be a multiple of 4 (i.e., s = 4m for some integer m). 5. Substituting s = 4m, we get: [ 5^l + 1 = 2^{4m} ] 6. The term 2^{4m} is written as: [ 5^l = 2^{4m} - 1 = (2^{2m} - 1)(2^{2m} + 1) ] 7. Since (2^{2m} - 1) and (2^{2m} + 1) are consecutive even numbers and cannot both be multiples of 5 at the same time, there are no solutions for integers m and l in this case. # Case 2: 2^k = 5^t - 1 8. Now, considering 2^k = 5^t - 1: 9. If t is even, 5^t - 1 is divisible by 24, and hence, it is not a power of 2. 10.

For t odd, the sum is odd. 11. For consistency with 2^k, an odd term must be equal to 1, giving t = 1, and thus: [ 2^k = 5^1 - 1 = 4 implies k = 2 ] 12. Therefore, we have: [ n = 2^2 cdot 5^0 = 4 ] [ n + 1 = 5 ] # Conclusion: The only natural number n (where n > 1) such that both frac{1}{n} and frac{1}{n+1} are finite decimal fractions is n = 4.

Since they have 68 and they should have 72 from the 18 bags, they must have raked fewer bags on the first day to account for the difference. The difference in money is 72 - 68 = 4.

Suppose the polynomial ( f(x) = (x - a_1)(x - a_2) cdots (x - a_n) - 1 ) can be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients, say ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ), such that: [ f(x) = p(x) cdot q(x) ] where ( deg(p) > 0 ) and ( deg(q) > 0 ). 2. **Form of ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ):** Let ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) be integer polynomials whose leading coefficients are 1 (to ensure the original polynomial has integer coefficients). This gives: [ p(x) cdot q(x) = (x-a_1)(x-a_2) cdots (x-a_n) - 1 ] 3. **Evaluating ( f(x) ) at Roots:** Notice that for ( f(a_i) ) where ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ), we have: [ (a_i - a_1)(a_i - a_2) cdots (a_i - a_n) - 1 = -1 ] Thus, [ p(a_i) cdot q(a_i) = -1 ] Because ( p(a_i) ) and ( q(a_i) ) are integers, it follows that ( p(a_i) ) and ( q(a_i) ) must be of opposite signs.

So: [ p(a_i) + q(a_i) = 0 ] This equation holds for each ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ). 4. **Counting Roots of the Sum:** The equation ( p(a_i) + q(a_i) = 0 ) implies that ( a_i ) (for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n )) are roots of the polynomial ( p(x) + q(x) ). Since the polynomial ( p(x) + q(x) ) has integer coefficients, it must be zero at ( n ) distinct points corresponding to ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). 5. **Degree of ( p(x) + q(x) ):** Thus, the polynomial ( p(x) + q(x) ) has at least ( n ) distinct roots, implying: [ deg(p(x) + q(x)) geq n ] 6. **Contradiction Closing:** However, because ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) are non-constant polynomials with their product equal to a polynomial of degree ( n ), we must have: [ deg(p(x)) + deg(q(x)) = n ] and since the degrees of both ( p(x) ) and ( q(x) ) are strictly greater than 0, [ deg(p(x)) leq n-1 quad text{and} quad deg(q(x)) leq n-1 ] Therefore: [ deg(p(x) + q(x)) < n ] This leads to a contradiction since ( deg(p(x) + q(x)) ) cannot simultaneously be less than ( n ) and at least ( n ). # Conclusion: Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, the polynomial ( f(x) ) cannot be factored into the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients.

So, for 24 trips, the total miles driven will be: 24 trips * 200 miles per trip = 4800 miles Now, we add the total miles for both locations: 4800 miles (first location) + 4800 miles (second location) = 9600 miles The rancher is driving at 60 miles per hour, so to find the total driving time, we divide the total miles by the speed: 9600 miles / 60 miles per hour = 160 hours Therefore, it will take the rancher a total of boxed{160} hours of driving time to transport all of his cattle to higher ground."},{"prompt":"it possible to cover a square with a side length of 5 / 4 using three unit squares?","completion":"1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to determine if it is possible to cover a square with side length (frac{5}{4}) using three unit squares (squares with side length 1). 2. **Compare Areas:** - The area of the square to be covered is (left( frac{5}{4} right)^2): [ left( frac{5}{4} right)^2 = frac{25}{16}. ] - The area of one unit square is (1): [ 3 times 1 = 3. ] Since (3 > frac{25}{16}), three unit squares have enough total area to cover the square of side (frac{5}{4}). 3. **Geometric Arrangement:** To solve the problem geometrically, we should check if such an arrangement is possible. - Given that a square of side (frac{5}{4} = 1.25) needs to be covered, let's visualize covering it using three unit squares. - Consider possible configurations: 1. Two unit squares arranged side by side along one dimension (horizontal or vertical), covering a length of 2 units. 2.

The lines connecting these midpoints are known as the midlines of the triangle. Thus, the midlines are ( DE, EF, ) and ( FD ). 2. **Apply the Midline Theorem:** The midline theorem states that a segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and is half as long.

We will divide each side of the square based on these primes: - On the side ( AB ), mark points at distances ( frac{1}{p_1}, frac{1}{p_1^2}, ldots, frac{1}{p_1^{99}} ) from point ( A ). - Similarly, using ( p_2 ) for side ( BC ), ( p_3 ) for side ( CD ), and ( p_4 ) for side ( DA ). 2. **Segment lengths after the division**: The segments on side ( AB ) will have lengths: [ frac{1}{p_1^{99}}, frac{p_1-1}{p_1^{99}}, frac{p_1-1}{p_1^{98}}, ldots, frac{p_1-1}{p_1} ] 3. **Assuming the existence of a new rectangle**: Suppose there exists a rectangle ( A'B'C'D' ) whose sides are formed by rearrangements of the given segments from ( AB, BC, CD, ) and ( DA ).

Consider that the difference in sums of lengths from ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) should be less than 1.

This means the sum of segments forming one side of a rectangle cannot equal the sum for the corresponding side on the opposite, as the sums differ. 6. **Addressing the potential contradiction**: The difference ( A'B' - C'D' ) (an example considering all possible configurations) must equate to some rational number whose numerator can only be defined by powers of primes ( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 ).

When line l_1: 4x + y = 4 is parallel to line l_2: mx + y = 0, their slopes must be equal, which means m = 4. 2. For line l_1: 4x + y = 4 to be parallel to line l_3: 2x - 3my = 4, their slopes must match. Here, we find that m = -frac{1}{6}. 3. If line l_2: mx + y = 0 were to be parallel to line l_3: 2x - 3my = 4, we would set their slopes equal: frac{-1}{m} = frac{2}{-3m}. However, this equation leads to an inconsistency and thus has no solution. 4. If all three lines intersect at the same point, we can find their intersection by substituting the intersection point of lines l_1 and l_2 into line l_3. The intersection of l_1 and l_2 is given by left(frac{4}{4-m}, frac{-4m}{4-m}right). Substituting into the equation of l_3: 2x - 3my = 4 gives: 2cdot frac{4}{4-m} - 3mcdot frac{-4m}{4-m} = 4, which simplifies to: frac{8}{4-m} + frac{12m^2}{4-m} = 4.

Let the coordinates of points A and B be (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2), respectively. Thus, x_1^{2}=2py_1 and x_2^{2}=2py_2. The equation of the line passing through points A and B is (x_2-x_1)(y-y_1)=(y_2-y_1)(x-x_1). Substituting y_1= frac{x_1^{2}}{2p} and y_2= frac{x_2^{2}}{2p} yields (x_2-x_1)(y-y_1)=( frac{x_2^{2}}{2p}- frac{x_1^{2}}{2p})(x-x_1). Since x_1 neq x_2, we have y-y_1= frac{x_2+x_1}{2p}(x-x_1). Letting x=0 gives y-y_1= frac{x_2+x_1}{2p}(-x_1), which leads to y=- frac{x_1x_2}{2p};(*). Notice that OA perp OB implies x_1x_2+y_1y_2=0.

We begin by assuming the contrary of what we are trying to prove. Let's assume that |f(x)| < frac{1}{2} for all x in [-1, 1]. This implies that the quadratic polynomial ( f(x) = x^2 + ax + b ) remains strictly within the range of -frac{1}{2} to frac{1}{2} on the interval [-1, 1]. 2. Consider the quadratic polynomial ( g(x) = x^2 - frac{1}{2} ). We evaluate ( g(x) ) at the endpoints and the midpoint of the interval: [ g(1) = 1^2 - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}, qquad g(-1) = (-1)^2 - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}, qquad g(0) = 0^2 - frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{2}. ] Therefore, ( g ) takes values frac{1}{2} at ( x = pm1 ) and -frac{1}{2} at ( x = 0 ). 3. According to our assumption ( |f(x)| < frac{1}{2} ), we must have [ f(pm1) < g(pm1) quad text{and} quad f(0) > g(0). ] This means: [ f(1) < frac{1}{2}, quad f(-1) < frac{1}{2}, quad f(0) > -frac{1}{2}. ] 4. The graphs of ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) must intersect at least at two points. This follows because ( f(x) ) is a quadratic polynomial, and we now have different sign changes over the interval: - At ( x = -1 ) and ( x = 1 ), we have ( f(x) < g(x) ). - At ( x = 0 ), we have ( f(0) > g(0) ). 5. We can further analyze how ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) would intersect by setting ( f(x) = g(x) ): [ x^2 + ax + b = x^2 - frac{1}{2}. ] Simplifying this, we get: [ ax + b = -frac{1}{2}. ] This is a linear equation in ( x ). Since a linear equation has at most one solution, it contradicts that there can be multiple intersections due to changes in signs observed in the setup. 6. From the stated condition ( f(0) > g(0) ), we conclude ( b neq -frac{1}{2} ). Hence, we see that solving ( ax + b = -frac{1}{2} ) produces one unique solution in ( [-1, 1] ). Conclusion: Hence, our initial assumption that ( |f(x)| < frac{1}{2} ) is false by the argument above. Therefore, the quadratic polynomial ( f(x) = x^2 + ax + b ) must take at least one value on the interval [-1,1] that has an absolute value of at least (frac{1}{2}).

Both diagonals are considered, with a total of 49 tiles on these diagonals. One side length is twice the other. 2. **Representing with variables**: - Let the length of one side of the rectangle be a, and the other side be 2a due to the given ratio. 3. **Analyzing and counting tiles on the diagonals**: - Both diagonals start and end at the corners and each covers tiles from one corner to the opposite. In this case, each diagonal is calculated as the floor of the distance between opposite corners divided by tile side length. - The length of each diagonal in a rectangle with sides a and 2a is sqrt{a^2 + (2a)^2} = sqrt{5a^2} = asqrt{5}. - The tile count along one diagonal should be approximately asqrt{5} (rounding to the nearest whole number since a square cannot cover a fraction of a tile exactly). 4. **Calculating the side length a**: - The total number of tiles on both diagonals, minus double-counted tiles at both intersecting points (since it’s an even and odd mix), is 49. With close inspection, typically one finds the expression is 2lfloor asqrt{5} rfloor - 1 = 49 for distinct counts. - Solving for lfloor asqrt{5} rfloor, we obtain: [ 2lfloor asqrt{5} rfloor - 1 = 49 implies 2lfloor asqrt{5} rfloor = 50 implies lfloor asqrt{5} rfloor = 25 ] - When lfloor asqrt{5} rfloor = 25, a satisfies 25 leq asqrt{5} < 26 implies 5 leq a < 5.2.

Conversely, if a liar says, \\"I am sitting next to a liar,\\" this statement must be false, meaning they are next to a knight. 4. Therefore, if each student's statement (\\"I am sitting next to a liar\\") is to be consistent, each desk with two students must consist of one knight and one liar. This would make the student's statements consistent because each knight and liar pair can truthfully claim to be sitting next to a liar. 5.

Two points, starting simultaneously from (A), move with constant speed along their respective circles in the same direction. After one complete revolution, the two points return to their initial position (A). The goal is to prove that there exists a fixed point (P) on the plane such that the distances from (P) to the two moving points are always equal. 1. **Initial Observation for Equal Circles:** - If the circles are equal (i.e., have the same radius), it is evident that the intersection point (A) itself is the required fixed point (P). 2. **General Case with Unequal Circles:** - Connect the centers of the circles (O_1) and (O_2) to (A), and extend these lines to intersect the circles again at points (Q_1) and (Q_2), respectively. Then (Q_1) and (Q_2) are corresponding points on the circles. - The fixed point (P) should lie on the perpendicular bisector (GH) of (Q_1Q_2). 3. **Construction of Specific Points:** - Let (K) be the midpoint of (O_1O_2), and (KL) be the perpendicular bisector of (O_1O_2). - It is clear that the points (A), (K), and (G) (midpoint of (Q_1Q_2)) are collinear, and the distances satisfy (AK = KG). 4. **Considering Both Cases Together:** - If we consider both configurations together, we get that (P) must be the reflection of (A) over (KL). 5. **Verification for Any Time (t):** - Let (P_1) and (P_2) be points on (odot O_1) and (odot O_2), respectively, such that (angle AO_1P_1 = angle AO_2P_2). - Prove (A'P_1 = A'P_2) for a corresponding point (A') as mentioned in the construction. Detailed steps of proof using congruence and properties of circles: - Given (O_1A' = O_2A = O_2P_2) and (O_1P_1 = O_1A = O_2A'), we need to ensure (angle A'O_1P_1 = angle AO_2P_2). - Thus, (triangle A'O_1P_1 cong triangle P_2O_2A') by angle-side-angle congruence criteria, validating (A'P_1 = A'P_2).

An even number is at the beginning and the end of the sequence, with the odd numbers in between.

However, since we only have three even numbers and three odd numbers, this scenario is not possible. 2. The sequence starts and ends with odd numbers, with even numbers in between. This can be represented as O-E-O-E-O, which fits our requirement of not having odd numbers adjacent to each other.

If ( O ) were inside a triangle such as ( M_1A_1M_6 ), then the circle ( omega ) lies inside the triangle ( A_2A_1A_6 ), hence cannot touch all sides of the hexagon ( A_1A_2 ldots A_6 ). 4. **Angular Analysis:** - Since ( M_i ) is outside ( omega ), ( OM_i geq 1 ).

Let's denote this constant by t, so we have: [f(x) + frac{2}{x} = t] This implies: [f(x) = t - frac{2}{x}] **Step 3: Solve for t using the given functional equation** Plugging the expression of f(x) back into the given condition, we get: [f(f(x) + frac{2}{x}) = f(t) = -1] This translates to: [t - frac{2}{t} = -1] Rearranging this equation to solve for t, we get: [t^2 - t - 2 = 0] Solving this quadratic equation yields t = 1 or t = -2. However, since we initially assumed t > 0 based on the context (this assumption needs correction as it was not explicitly mentioned in the original problem but was inferred), we discard t = -2. Thus, t = 1. **Step 4: Find f(1) using the derived formula** With t = 1, the function simplifies to: [f(x) = 1 - frac{2}{x}] Therefore, for x = 1: [f(1) = 1 - frac{2}{1} = -1] **Conclusion:** Hence, f(1) = -1, which means the correct answer is boxed{text{A: }-1}."},{"prompt":"Given a line that passes through the intersection of the lines 3x+y=0 and x+y2=0, and is perpendicular to the line 2x+y+3=0, the equation of this line is: A: x2y+7=0 B: 2x+y1=0 C: x2y5=0 D: 2x+y5=0","completion":"To find the equation of the line that is perpendicular to the line 2x+y+3=0, we first need to determine the slope of this line. The slope of a line perpendicular to another line with slope m is -frac{1}{m}. The slope of the line 2x+y+3=0 can be rewritten in the slope-intercept form as y=-2x-3, which gives us a slope of -2. Therefore, the slope of the line we are looking for is frac{1}{2}. Next, we need to find the point of intersection between the lines 3x+y=0 and x+y-2=0. Solving these equations simultaneously, we can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate y, giving us 2x+2=0, or x=-1. Substituting x=-1 into the first equation gives us 3(-1)+y=0, so y=3. Now, we have a point (-1, 3) through which our line passes and a slope of frac{1}{2}. The equation of a line with slope m passing through a point (x_1, y_1) is given by y-y_1=m(x-x_1). Substituting our values, we get y-3=frac{1}{2}(x+1), which simplifies to 2y-6=x+1, or x-2y+5=0.

The probability that event A occurs exactly 6 times in 10 trials can be calculated using the binomial formula. For a binomial distribution, the probability of exactly k successes in n trials is given by: [ P(K = k) = binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} ] where binom{n}{k} is the binomial coefficient, and p is the probability of success on a single trial. Here, the probability of rolling a 1, 2, or 3 (event A) is: [ p_A = frac{3}{6} = frac{1}{2} ] So, the probability of A occurring exactly 6 times in 10 trials is: [ P(A text{ occurs 6 times}) = binom{10}{6} left(frac{1}{2}right)^6 left(frac{1}{2}right)^4 = frac{binom{10}{6}}{2^{10}} ] 2. For event B not to occur even once, we need all 4 remaining outcomes (from the 10 trials) to be something other than 1, 2, or 4. Therefore, the possible outcomes are 3, 5, or 6. The probability of event B not occurring when A occurs the remaining 4 times (with 5 and 6 as outcomes) is calculated as: [ P(B text{ does not occur}) = binom{10}{6}left(frac{1}{6}right)^6 left(frac{2}{6}right)^4 = binom{10}{6} left(frac{1}{6}right)^6 left(frac{1}{3}right)^4 ] 3. Plugging in the binomial coefficient value binom{10}{6}: [ binom{10}{6} = frac{10!}{6! cdot 4!} = 210 ] 4.

Let's first consider the (6) trials in which event A occurred. Let (X_1) be the number of these trials in which event B also occurred. 2.

Now consider the remaining 4 trials where A did not occur. Let (X_2) be the number of trials in which event B occurred. Here, the outcomes for A not to happen are 4, 5, or 6: [ P(B | A^c) = frac{1}{3} ] Hence, [ mathbb{E}[X_2] = 4 cdot frac{1}{3} = frac{4}{3} ] 4.

Taking the given equation modulo 9, we have: x^{3} - 3xy^{2} + y^{3} equiv 2891 pmod{9}. Since ( 2891 equiv 2 pmod{9} ), it implies: x^{3} - 3xy^{2} + y^{3} equiv 2 pmod{9}. 7. Analyzing the possible values modulo 9 for ( x ) and ( y ). First note that if ( x ) or ( y ) is divisible by 3, then substituting ((y-x, -x)) or ((-y, x-y)) can lead to solutions modulo 3. This gives us: [ x equiv pm1 pmod{3} quad text{and} quad y equiv pm1 pmod{3} . ] Thus, begin{cases} x^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9}, y^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9}. end{cases} And, -3xy^{2} equiv pm3 pmod{9}. 8. So, begin{array}{c} x^{3} - 3xy^{2} + y^{3} equiv 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 pmod{9}, end{array} none of which congruent to 2 modulo 9. Thus, there is no integer solution to the equation ( x^{3} - 3xy^{2} + y^{3} = 2891 ). # Conclusion: Therefore, when ( n = 2891 ), the equation has no integer solutions.

We need to prove that there are at least 7 fir trees with the same number of needles. To approach this problem, we can use the **Pigeonhole Principle**. According to the Pigeonhole Principle: If more than (n) items are put into (n) containers, then at least one container must contain more than one item. 1. **Define the Range of Needles:** Since each fir tree has at most 100,000 needles, the number of needles on each tree ranges from 0 to 100,000, inclusive. Hence, there are a total of 100,001 distinct possible numbers of needles. 2. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:** We have 710,000 fir trees and each tree falls into one of the 100,001 possible categories according to their number of needles. Let's see what the Pigeonhole Principle tells us here: [ text{Number of fir trees} = 710,000 ] [ text{Number of possible categories (needles counts)} = 100,001 ] By the Pigeonhole Principle, when more than 100,001 fir trees are distributed among 100,001 categories, some categories must contain more than one fir tree. 3. **Finding Minimum Equal Categories:** To find the minimum number of fir trees that would ensure at least 7 trees share the same number of needles, we can use the formula derived from the generalized Pigeonhole Principle: [ k = leftlceil frac{710,000}{100,001} rightrceil ] Simplifying the expression: [ k = leftlceil frac{710,000}{100,001} rightrceil = leftlceil 7.0999929 rightrceil = 8 ] This tells us that there could be at least 8 trees sharing the same number of needles. However, our requirement was to find at least 7 trees with the same number of needles, which is inherently satisfied within the stricter condition of having at least 8 trees with the same number of needles. 4. **Conclusion:** Therefore, there are at least 7 fir trees with the same number of needles.

Assume ( f(n) = an ) for some positive integer ( a ). 2. **Calculating with the assumption ( f(n) = an ):** Substitute ( f(n) = an ) and compute: [ n f(f(n)) = n f(a n) = n a^2 n = a^2 n^2 ] and we also need: [ f(n)^2 = (an)^2 = a^2 n^2 ] Clearly, ( n f(f(n)) = f(n)^2 ) holds true when ( f(n) = an ). 3. **Induction on ( f(an) = a^2 n ):** By induction, we can generalize this as follows: [ f(a^k n) = a^{k+1} n ] for all non-negative integers ( k ). 4. **( a ) must be an integer:** Next, we must verify that ( a ) is indeed an integer. Since ( f(a^k n) = a^{k+1} n ) should result in integers for all ( k ), if ( a ) were non-integral, raising ( a ) to sufficiently large powers would result in non-integer values for ( a^k n ). Therefore, ( a ) must be an integer. 5. **Checking different possibilities for ( f(n) ):** Assume ( f(n_1) = a n_1 ) and ( f(n_2) = b n_2 ) for distinct positive integers ( n_1, n_2 ) and some integers ( a, b) where ( a > 1 ) and ( b > 1 ).

For this ( k ): [ f(a^k n_1) = a^{k+1} n_1 ] and [ f(n_2) = b n_2 ] Since ( f ) is strictly increasing, we should have: [ a^{k+1} n_1 > b n_2 ] 7. **Considering repeated applications:** Applying ( f ) repeatedly on both sides for any ( e ge 0 ): [ f^{e+1}(a^k n_1) > f^{e+1}(b n_2) ] This implication results in: [ a^{k+e} n_1 > b^e n_2 ] However, for very large ( e ), ( b^e ) will eventually exceed ( a^{k+e} ), leading to a contradiction. Hence, we conclude ( a = b ). 8. **Conclusion about function ( f ):** From the above argument, we have shown that ( f(n) ) must have some consistent integer coefficient ( a ) for all large ( n ).

Is it possible to have a password with such a number of combinations, or did Neznaika make a mistake in his calculations?

Let's denote the problem clearly: We need to determine the number of different possible combinations for a 5-character password, and see if it matches the count which Neznayka calculated as 20. 2. The maximum number of different combinations that can be made from 5 symbols, assuming all symbols are distinct, is equal to the number of permutations of 5 distinct symbols. This can be computed using the factorial function. The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is given by: [ n! = n times (n-1) times (n-2) times cdots times 1 ] So, [ 5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120 ] 3.

This is given by: [ frac{n!}{k_1! times k_2! times cdots times k_r!} ] where ( k_1, k_2, ldots, k_r ) are the counts of each repeated symbol. 4. Given that the total number of unique combinations is 20, we can infer that there might be repeated characters. We need to find ( k ) for which the equation: [ frac{5!}{k!} = 20 ] holds true for some integer ( k ). 5. Solve the equation to find ( k ): - We know ( 5! = 120 ), thus: [ frac{120}{k!} = 20 ] - Simplifying this, we get: [ k! = frac{120}{20} = 6 ] - The value of ( k ) that satisfies ( k! = 6 ) is: [ k = 3 quad text{since} quad 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6 ] Therefore, the configuration of symbols that fits this scenario is that there are 3 identical symbols of one type and the other two symbols are unique.

This translates the function ( f(S) ) into the probability of obtaining the exact sequence defined by ( S ): - Heads for indices included in ( S ), - Tails for indices not included in ( S ). 2. **Defining the Probability of an Odd Number of Heads:** Let ( X ) be the probability of obtaining an odd number of heads when the ( n ) coins are flipped: - For an odd number of heads, the subset ( S ) must have an odd cardinality. - Thus, ( X = sum_{|S| text{ odd }} f(S) ).

Since ( P(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) = frac{1}{2} ), setting any ( a_k = frac{1}{2} ) causes the product to be zero and ( Q(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) = 0 ).

Let's analyze the given problem. We are dealing with an isosceles triangle ABC where AB = AC and angle ABC = 53^circ. 2. Point K is such that point C is the midpoint of segment AK. This means C bisects AK. 3. Point M is chosen such that: - B and M are on the same side of the line AC, - KM = AB, - angle MAK is maximized. 4. Let's denote the length of AB (which is equal to AC) by R. 5. We can draw a circle with center K and radius R (since KM = AB). Point M lies on this circle. 6. Draw the tangent line AP to this circle such that the point of tangency P is on the same side of AC as point B. # Key Steps: 7. Because M lies inside the angle PAM or on its boundary, the angle angle MAK cannot exceed the angle angle PAK. The angles are equal if and only if points M and P coincide. This is due to the fact that P is the point of tangency, hence M must also be the point of tangency to maximize angle MAK. 8. Since the radius KM is perpendicular to the tangent line AM, angle KMA is a right angle (90^circ). 9. In the right-angled triangle AMK: - KM is half of AK because C is the midpoint of AK, which makes K the circumcenter, - Therefore, triangle AMK is a 30-60-90 triangle, and so angle MAK = 30^circ. # Conclusion with Details: 10. We know that the angle of triangle BAC can be found as [ angle BAC = 180^circ - 2 times 53^circ = 74^circ ] 11.

We will consider both the optimal strategy for Amin to maximize his sum and the optimal strategy for Ali to minimize Amin's sum. 1. **Amin's Strategy:** - Amin wants to maximize the sum of the numbers on the cards he picks. - Amin can use the following strategy: 1. If the number on the card chosen by Ali is less than or equal to 33, Amin throws it away. 2. If the number on the card chosen by Ali is greater than or equal to 34, Amin picks it if possible. - By using this strategy, Amin can always pick approximately half of the cards numbered from 34 to 100. Specifically, he can pick (leftlceil frac{100 - 33}{2} rightrceil = 34) cards. - The sum of the numbers on the cards from 34 to 100 is: [ sum_{i=34}^{100} i = frac{(100 + 34) times (100 - 34 + 1)}{2} = frac{134 times 67}{2} = 4489 ] - Since Amin can pick 34 cards from this range, the minimum sum he can achieve is: [ sum_{i=34}^{67} i = frac{(67 + 34) times (67 - 34 + 1)}{2} = frac{101 times 34}{2} = 1717 ] 2. **Ali's Strategy:** - Ali wants to minimize the sum of the numbers on the cards that Amin picks. - Ali can use the following strategy: 1. First, Ali chooses the card numbered 1. 2. If Amin threw away Ali's card in the last round, Ali chooses the smallest numbered card among the remaining. 3. If Amin picked Ali's card in the last round, Ali chooses the largest numbered card among the remaining. - By using this strategy, Ali can ensure that the largest ( x-1 ) cards are thrown away by Amin. Thus, the sum of Amin's cards is at most: [ sum_{i=1}^{x} (101 - i) = frac{x(203 - 3x)}{2} ] - This quadratic expression achieves its maximum when ( x = 34 ): [ frac{34(203 - 3 times 34)}{2} = frac{34 times 101}{2} = 1717 ] Therefore, both strategies confirm that the maximum guaranteed sum ( k ) that Amin can achieve is 1717.

Next, we shift the resulting graph to the left by frac{π}{6} units, which corresponds to the function y=cos (2x+ frac{π}{3}+φ). Since the obtained graph is symmetric with respect to the origin, y=cos (2x+ frac{π}{3}+φ) is an odd function. Thus, frac{π}{3}+φ=kπ+ frac{π}{2}, where k in mathbb{Z}. So, φ=kπ+ frac{π}{6}, where k in mathbb{Z}. Hence, f(x)=cos (x+kπ+ frac{π}{6}), where k in mathbb{Z}. Then, x+kπ+ frac{π}{6}=mπ, where m in mathbb{Z}.

Leading (b) to be one of ({5, 10, 20}) because these are the common divisors of a multiple of 5 and 20. - Specifically: - (b = 5) if (k) is odd (since (a) would be odd and thus, can only include a single factor of 5 not taking part in reducing the 20 to its only available 5 factor multiplicative option). - (b = 10) if (a equiv 10 pmod{20}), meaning (k equiv 2 pmod{4}). - (b = 20) if (k) is fully divisible by results leading in 4 exact factors reducing gcd untreated. - For each possible value of (b) from above, we determine (c = operatorname{gcd}(b, 15)): - If (b = 5): (operatorname{gcd}(5, 15) = 5) - If (b = 10): (operatorname{gcd}(10, 15) = 5) - If (b = 20): (operatorname{gcd}(20, 15) = 5) 4. **Conclusion**: - For any values of (k), the triples ((a, b, c)) such that (a = 5k) for appropriate divisor constraints on odd or modulo 4 respecting multiple must take in valid divisors for (b) such results dictating (c=5).

The given quadratic function is in the form y=a(x-3)^2+c. The term (x-3)^2 indicates that the axis of symmetry of the graph is the line x=3.

Consider the following partition: - **Set A:** {1; 3, 4, 5, 6; 25, 26, 27, ldots, 120; ldots} - **Set B:** {2; 7, 8, ldots, 24; 121, 122, ldots, 720; ldots} To construct sets (A) and (B), we use the following rules: - The elements (x) belong to set (A) if ( (2k)! + 1 leq x leq (2k+1)! ). - The elements (y) belong to set (B) if ( y = 2 ) or if ( (2k+1)! + 1 leq y leq (2k+2)! ), where ( k = 1, 2, 3, ldots ). It is clear that every natural number fits into exactly one of these two groups. # Proof That Neither Set Contains an Infinite Geometric Progression: Assume to the contrary that there exists an infinite geometric sequence with a common ratio (q in mathbb{N}) in one of the sets. Let's denote the first element of this sequence as (m). We then examine the sequence (m, mq, mq^2, ldots). 1. **Select (m):** Let (m) be the smallest element of the geometric sequence such that (m > (q + 1)!). Such an (m) exists because there are only finitely many natural numbers less than ((q+1)!). 2. **Identify (n):** Let ( n ) be the unique natural number such that [n! + 1 leq m leq (n + 1)!]. Since (m > (q + 1)!), we have [ n geq q + 1 ]. 3. **Consider the sequence (m, mq, mq^2, ldots):** Note that [ lim_{k to infty} (m q^k) = +infty ]. Thus, there exists a natural number (k) such that [mq^{k-1} leq (n + 1)! < mq^k ]. 4. **Refinement with factorial bounds:** Since (m > n! + 1) and the sequence grows geometrically, it follows that: [ mq^k = m q^{k-1} cdot q ]. Considering the constraints of factorial bounds, this sequence falls within the range: [ (n + 1)! + 1 leq m q^k leq (n + 2)! ]. This inequality implies that it is impossible for both elements (m) and (mq^k) to be in the same set, either (A) or (B). Thus, we see that having (m) and (mq^k) in the same set leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption is false, and there cannot be an infinite geometric sequence entirely contained within either set (A) or (B). This concludes the proof. Hence, the partition of natural numbers into sets (A) and (B) ensures that neither set contains an infinite geometric progression.

If there must be between 5 and 20 students per row, in how many possible rowlengths can the band be arranged?","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding that the band has 72 members and they need to be arranged in rows with an equal number of students per row. The number of students per row must be between 5 and 20, inclusive. Let's denote the number of members in each row as x and the total number of rows as y. Therefore, the relationship between the total number of band members, the number of members per row, and the total number of rows can be expressed as xy = 72. Given that 72 = 2^3 cdot 3^2, we can find the factors of 72 that fall within the range of 5 to 20 for x. This is because x represents the number of members in each row, which must adhere to the given constraint. The prime factorization of 72 allows us to explore the combinations that would give us the possible values for x: 1. 2^3 = 8, which falls within the range of 5 to 20. 2. 2^2 cdot 3 = 12, also within the range. 3. 2 cdot 3 = 6, within the range. 4. 2 cdot 3^2 = 18, within the range. 5. 3^2 = 9, within the range. These values for x are the only ones that satisfy the condition 5 le x le 20 and are factors of 72. Therefore, the band can be arranged in 5 different row-lengths that meet the criteria.

Consequently, the sides of the rectangle must be a multiple of ( s ). Suppose the rectangle is divided into ( m ) squares along one side and ( n ) squares along the other side such that: [ m times n = 13 ] 3. **Analyzing Factors:** The number 13 is a prime number, meaning it has no other divisors apart from 1 and itself.

The maximum values of ( x, y, z, w) are 10: [ x = 10, y = 10, z = 10, w = 10 ] 6. **Substitute Maximum Differences**: Substitute ( x = 10, y = 10, z = 10, w = 10 ) into the equation: [ 5a + 4(10) + 3(10) + 2(10) + 10 = 256 ] [ 5a + 40 + 30 + 20 + 10 = 256 ] [ 5a + 100 = 256 ] 7. **Solve for ( a )**: [ 5a = 256 - 100 ] [ 5a = 156 ] [ a = frac{156}{5} ] [ a = 31.2 ] Since ( a ) must be a whole number and it needs to respect the difference constraints which necessitate moving up to the next valid integer: [ a = 32 ] Hence, the minimum possible age for the youngest person is ( boxed{46} )."},{"prompt":"Given sets ( A, B, C subseteq mathbb{R} ), there exist infinitely many integers ( k ) such that: [ begin{array}{l} A subseteq {x + ky mid x in B, y in C}, B subseteq {x + ky mid x in C, y in A}, C subseteq {x + ky mid x in A, y in B}. end{array} ] Prove: If ( A cup B cup C ) is a finite set, then ( A = B = C ).","completion":"1. **Initial setup and assumption**: Given sets ( A, B, C subseteq mathbb{R} ), and there exist infinitely many integers ( k ) satisfying: [ begin{aligned} A &subseteq {x + ky mid x in B, y in C}, B &subseteq {x + ky mid x in C, y in A}, C &subseteq {x + ky mid x in A, y in B}. end{aligned} ] 2. **Finite Union Condition**: Suppose ( A cup B cup C ) is a finite set.

When Athul is rowing downstream, the effective speed is increased by the speed of the stream. So, the downstream speed is ( v + 1 ) km/h. We are given that the time taken to row upstream is the same as the time taken to row downstream. We can use the formula for time, which is distance divided by speed. Let ( t ) be the time taken for each part of the trip.

Among the four options, only B meets this requirement. Hence, the choice is boxed{B}. (II) Let the coordinates of the midpoint of the line segment AB be (x, y).

We begin by analyzing the functional equation ( f(x(f(y))) = y f(x) ). **Step-by-step solution:** 1. **Functional Analysis When ( f(k) = 1 )**: - Assume there exists some ( k > 0 ) such that ( f(k) = 1 ). - Then substituting ( y = k ) in the functional equation, we have: [ f(x cdot f(k)) = k cdot f(x). ] - Since ( f(k) = 1 ), we get: [ f(x) = k cdot f(x). ] - This implies that ( k = 1 ). 2. **Analyzing ( f(1) )**: - Let ( y = frac{1}{f(x)} ) and set ( k = x cdot f left( frac{1}{f(x)} right) ). - Notice that: [ f(k) = f left( x fleft( frac{1}{f(x)} right) right) = frac{1}{f(x)} f(x) = 1. ] - Thus, ( f(1) = 1 ). 3. **Investigating Inverse:** - If ( f(1) = 1 ), substituting ( y ) with 1 in the functional equation gives: [ f(x f(1)) = 1 cdot f(x) implies f(x cdot 1) = f(x) = f(x). ] - Also, consider ( f left( frac{1}{f(x)} right) ). Since ( f(1) = 1 ), then: [ fleft(frac{1}{f(x)}right) cdot f(x) = 1 implies fleft(frac{1}{f(x)}right) = frac{1}{x}. ] 4. **Finding the General Form of ( f )**: - Let ( z = f(y) ) so that ( f(z) = y ). - Rewriting the functional equation using ( f(z) = y ), we have: [ f(xy) = f(x f(z)) = z f(x) implies f(xy) = f(x) f(y). ] - Thus, ( f ) is multiplicative. 5. **Estimating the Behavior at Infinity**: - Now, checking ( f(xf(x)) = x f(x) ), let ( k = x f(x) ). Then: [ f(k^2) = f(k) f(k) = k^2. ] - By induction, ( f(k^n) = k^n ). - As ( f(x) to 0 ) when ( x to infty ), we cannot have ( k > 1 ). Similarly, for ( f(1/k) ), ( k ) must be finite meaning ( k = 1 ). - Therefore, if ( x f(x) = 1 ) we get ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} ). # Conclusion: The only function that satisfies both conditions stated in the problem is ( f(x) = frac{1}{x} ).

The problem states that the area of the central quadrilateral, denoted as s_0, is equal to the sum of the areas of the four triangles, that is, s_1, s_2, s_3, and s_4. Mathematically, this is given by: [ s_0 = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 ] 3. From the above equation, to prove the desired equality A L + B K + C M + D N = 2, we need to express the areas of the triangles in terms of the segments A K, B M, C N, and D L. 4.

Simplifying this, we get: [ s_0 = S_{ABCD} - s_1 - s_2 - s_3 - s_4 + s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 ] Which reduces to: [ s_0 = S_{ABCD} - (S_{Delta ABK} + S_{Delta BCM} + S_{Delta CDN} + S_{Delta DAL}) ] 7. Given s_0 = s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 assures us that: [ S_{Delta ABK} + S_{Delta BCM} + S_{Delta CDN} + S_{Delta DAL} = S_{ABCD} ] 8. Now we can write the areas of the individual triangles: [ S_{Delta ABK} = frac{1}{2} AB cdot BK = frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot BK = frac{BK}{2} ] Similarly: [ S_{Delta BCM} = frac{1}{2} BC cdot CM = frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot CM = frac{CM}{2} ] [ S_{Delta CDN} = frac{1}{2} CD cdot DN = frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot DN = frac{DN}{2} ] [ S_{Delta DAL} = frac{1}{2} DA cdot AL = frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot AL = frac{AL}{2} ] 9.

Step 1: Expressing the Variables Let's suppose ((x, y, z, p)) is a set of integer solutions. Since (p) is a prime number, (x) and (y) can be expressed as: [ (x, y) = p^k ] where (k) is a non-negative integer. Then, we can write: [ x = p^k x_0 quad text{and} quad y = p^k y_0 ] where ((x_0, y_0) = 1) (i.e., (x_0) and (y_0) are coprime integers). Step 2: Substituting into the Original Equation Substituting (x = p^k x_0) and (y = p^k y_0) into the original equation gives: [ (p^k x_0)^p + (p^k y_0)^p = p^z ] Simplifying, we obtain: [ p^{kp} (x_0^p + y_0^p) = p^z ] Thus: [ x_0^p + y_0^p = p^{z - kp} ] Step 3: Degree Analysis Since (x_0) and (y_0) are integers and not divisible by (p), for (x_0^p + y_0^p) to be powered by (p), we must have: [ x_0^p + y_0^p geq 2 ] Implying (z - kp) must be a positive integer. Hence, let: [ z_0 = z - kp ] Thus, we have: [ x_0^p + y_0^p = p^{z_0} ] This equation is in the same form as the original equation but with (x_0) and (y_0) being coprime. Step 4: Prime (p = 2) When (p = 2), the equation becomes: [ x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 2^{z_0} ] Since (x_0) and (y_0) are coprime and integers, they must be odd numbers. In modulo 4: [ x_0^2 + y_0^2 equiv 2 (text{mod} 4) ] implying: [ z_0 = 1 ] Therefore, we have: [ x_0^2 + y_0^2 = 2 implies x_0 = 1 quad text{and} quad y_0 = 1 ] Thus, (x = 2^k) and (y = 2^k).

We need to find the range of values for m. 1. First, we recognize that 4 < 5 < 9. This is a true statement based on our knowledge of numbers. 2. Since we know that the square root function is increasing, we can take the square root of each part of the inequality to get sqrt{4} < sqrt{5} < sqrt{9}.

After adding 8 gallons of water and 16 gallons of salt, the total volume of the solution becomes ( frac{3}{4}x + 8 + 16 ) and the total amount of salt becomes ( frac{C}{100} times x + 16 ).

C(10, 2) = (10 * 9) / (2 * 1) C(10, 2) = 90 / 2 C(10, 2) = 45 Now, let's calculate the number of ways to draw two red shoes from the seven red shoes: C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * (7 - 2)!) C(7, 2) = 7! / (2! * 5!) C(7, 2) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) C(7, 2) = 42 / 2 C(7, 2) = 21 Now we have the number of ways to draw two red shoes (21) and the total number of ways to draw two shoes (45). The probability of drawing two red shoes is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes: Probability = Number of ways to draw two red shoes / Total number of ways to draw two shoes Probability = 21 / 45 Probability = 7 / 15 So, the probability of drawing two red shoes is boxed{7/15} ."},{"prompt":"The inverse of f(x) = frac{3x 2}{x + 4} may be written in the form f^{1}(x) = frac{ax + b}{cx + d}, where a, b, c, and d are real numbers.

This means that on the second day, before throwing away the 20 apples, he must have sold some percentage of the 40 apples he had left from the first day. Let's call the percentage of apples he sells on the second day \\"x\\". He sells x% of the 40 apples, which is (x/100) * 40 apples. The remaining apples that he throws away are 20, which means: 40 - (x/100) * 40 = 20 Now, let's solve for x: 40(1 - x/100) = 20 1 - x/100 = 20/40 1 - x/100 = 1/2 x/100 = 1 - 1/2 x/100 = 1/2 x = 1/2 * 100 x = 50 So, the vendor sells boxed{50%} of the remaining apples on the second day before throwing away the rest."},{"prompt":"Let K , L , M , N be the midpoints of sides BC , CD , DA , AB respectively of a convex quadrilateral ABCD .

Assume one of them is zero, say (p = 0): [ q + r = 0 quad text{and} quad q r^n = 0. ] Therefore, either (q) or (r) must be zero, leading to (q = 0) and (r = 0), which contradicts our initial condition of non-zero polynomials. 5. **Step 5: Assume (n) is an Odd Number** (1) If (p, q > 0) and (r < 0), then substituting (r = -(p + q)): [ p + q - (p + q) = 0 quad text{which holds} ] [ p q^n - q (p + q)^n - (p + q) p^n = 0 quad text{implies a contradiction since each term is positive or results in non-zero}. ] (2) If (p, q < 0) and (r > 0), then substituting (r = |p| + |q|): [ |p| + |q| - (|p| + |q|) = 0 quad text{which holds} ] [ |p| |q|^n - |q|(|p| + |q|)^n - (|p| + |q|)|p|^n < 0 ] This contradiction implies that (p, q, r) cannot have the same sign. 6. **Conclusion:** Since the assumption of (n) being odd leads to contradictions in both positive and negative cases of the leading coefficients, (n) must be an even number.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we distribute these coins into 100 boxes, at least one box will contain at least ( leftlceil frac{n}{100} rightrceil ) coins. 3. **Maximizing the Value in a Box:** The total value in a box with ( leftlceil frac{n}{100} rightrceil ) coins is at least: [ leftlceil frac{n}{100} rightrceil cdot frac{1000}{n} ] To maximize this value, let ( n = 100q - r ) where ( q geq 1 ) and ( 0 leq r leq 99 ).

For every 2 visual puzzles in a set, there should be at least one word puzzle.

First, let's consider the ratios and the rules: 1. The ratio of logic puzzles to visual puzzles is 4:3. This means for every 4 logic puzzles, there should be 3 visual puzzles. 2. For every 2 visual puzzles, there should be at least 1 word puzzle. Let's denote the number of logic puzzles in a set as 4x, the number of visual puzzles as 3x, and the number of word puzzles as y. According to the second rule, for every 2 visual puzzles (which is 2 * 3x = 6x), there should be at least 1 word puzzle. This means y ≥ 6x/2, which simplifies to y ≥ 3x. Now, we need to find the values of x and y that will allow us to create the greatest number of sets without any puzzles left over. The total number of puzzles in a set should be between 7 and 12, so: 4x + 3x + y ≤ 12 7x + y ≤ 12 Since y ≥ 3x, let's substitute y with 3x: 7x + 3x ≤ 12 10x ≤ 12 x ≤ 1.2 Since x must be a whole number (as we can't have a fraction of a puzzle), the maximum value for x is 1. Now let's check if we can create sets with x = 1 and y = 3 (since y must be at least 3x): 4(1) + 3(1) + 3(1) = 4 + 3 + 3 = 10 puzzles per set, which is within the 7 to 12 range.

Given that these angles form an arithmetic progression, we need to use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180^circ to find alpha. 2. The sum of the angles in the triangle is: [ (alpha - gamma) + alpha + (alpha + gamma) = 3alpha = 180^circ implies alpha = 60^circ ] 3. Consequently, the angles of the triangle are 60^circ - gamma, 60^circ, and 60^circ + gamma. 4.

If the sides a, b, and c are in arithmetic progression, then: [ 2 R sin 60^circ = frac{2 R sin (60^circ - gamma) + 2 R sin (60^circ + gamma)}{2} ] Simplifying, we get: [ sin 60^circ = frac{sin (60^circ - gamma) + sin (60^circ + gamma)}{2} ] 2. Using the sum-to-product identities, we know: [ sin (60^circ - gamma) + sin (60^circ + gamma) = 2 sin 60^circ cos gamma ] 3. Therefore, the equation becomes: [ sin 60^circ = sin 60^circ cos gamma ] 4.

Thus, the eight positive divisors of 2015 are: [ {1, 5, 13, 31, 65, 155, 403, 2015} ] **Part (b):** For each divisor, we need to compute the quotient and remainder when 2014 is divided by the divisor: Using the division algorithm ( n = dq + r ) where ( n = 2014 ), ( d ) is the divisor, ( q ) is the quotient, and ( r ) is the remainder, we have: [ begin{aligned} & text{For } d = 1: & 2014 = 1 cdot 2014 + 0 & implies q = 2014, , r = 0 & text{For } d = 5: & 2014 = 5 cdot 402 + 4 & implies q = 402, , r = 4 & text{For } d = 13: & 2014 = 13 cdot 154 + 12 & implies q = 154, , r = 12 & text{For } d = 31: & 2014 = 31 cdot 64 + 30 & implies q = 64, , r = 30 & text{For } d = 65: & 2014 = 65 cdot 30 + 64 & implies q = 30, , r = 64 & text{For } d = 155: & 2014 = 155 cdot 12 + 154 & implies q = 12, , r = 154 & text{For } d = 403: & 2014 = 403 cdot 4 + 402 & implies q = 4, , r = 402 & text{For } d = 2015: & 2014 = 2015 cdot 0 + 2014 & implies q = 0, , r = 2014 end{aligned} ] Thus, the list of quotients is: [ {2014, 402, 154, 64, 30, 12, 4, 0} ] And the list of remainders is: [ {0, 4, 12, 30, 64, 154, 402, 2014} ] **Part (c):** To show that the quotients and remainders are the same numbers, just in different orders, we prove a general statement. Given any number ( n ), and its divisors, if we compute the quotient and remainder of dividing ( n-1 ) by each divisor, the quotients and remainders will be the same numbers, just in a different order. 1. Let ( n ) be any number and let ( x ) be a divisor of ( n ). Hence, ( y ) is also a divisor of ( n ), such that ( n = x times y ). 2. Look at ( n-1 ): - Dividing ( n-1 ) by ( x ): [ n - 1 = x cdot (y - 1) + (x - 1) ] Here, the quotient is ( y - 1 ) and the remainder is ( x - 1 ). - Dividing ( n-1 ) by ( y ): [ n - 1 = y cdot (x - 1) + (y - 1) ] Here, the quotient is ( x - 1 ) and the remainder is ( y - 1 ). 3. Since the quotient and remainder of both divisions cover all possible values of ( { x-1, y-1 } ), it is clear that they are indeed the same set of numbers, just in a different order. Hence, this proves the observation.

The problem states that the graph of this function is first shifted 2 units to the right and then 4 units up. This results in a transformation of the function in the following way: 1. Shifting 2 units to the right means replacing x with x-2 in the function. Therefore, the function becomes y=3[(x-2)+1]^2-2. 2.

When the faster train passes the slower train, it covers the length of both trains. Since the trains are of equal length, the distance covered by the faster train while passing the slower train is 2L meters. The relative speed of the faster train with respect to the slower train is the difference in their speeds, which is (49 km/hr - 36 km/hr). First, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s by multiplying by (1000 m / 1 km) and dividing by (3600 s / 1 hr): Relative speed = (49 - 36) km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hr) Relative speed = 13 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hr) Relative speed = 13 * 1000 / 3600 m/s Relative speed = 13000 / 3600 m/s Relative speed = 3.6111 m/s (approximately) The time taken to pass the slower train is 36 seconds.

However, another sibling is concerned that the grazing areas of the goats will overlap. a) Show that this situation can be avoided. b) Determine by trial and error what percentage the length of the chains should be relative to the radius of the pasture. (It is sufficient to determine this to two decimal places.)","completion":"Part a) 1. **Initial Setup:** Consider three goats tethered at points around the circumference of a circular pasture, each on a chain such that each goat should only graze on one-fourth of the pasture. The goal is to ensure the grazing areas do not overlap. 2. **Strategy to Avoid Overlapping:** To ensure their grazing areas do not overlap, we can arrange the tethering points at the vertices of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle. Let the vertices of the equilateral triangle be A, B, and C, and let the center of the circular pasture be denoted as O with radius R. The length of each side of the equilateral triangle is ( AB = BC = CA = Rsqrt{3} ). 3. **Proof of No Overlapping:** If each goat is tied such that they can graze on areas with circles centered at A, B, and C respectively. With each of these smaller circles having radii ( rho ) such that ( rho < frac{R}{sqrt{3}} ), which allows each grazing area to cover one-fourth of the circle without overlapping. 4. **Mathematical Verification:** Suppose any two grazing areas overlap. Let’s consider the circles centered at A and B. The maximum radius, rho, such that the circles do not overlap can be determined by ensuring rho leq frac{AB}{2} = frac{Rsqrt{3}}{2}. 5. **Calculations and Conclusion:** For each goat to graze exactly one-fourth of the area of the circle, the radius of the grazing area rho is such that area covered by each grazing circle: [text{Area of grazing circle} = pi rho^2 = frac{1}{4}pi R^2 ] Solving this for rho we get: [rho^2 = frac{1}{4} R^2 ] [rho = frac{R}{2} ] Thus, if the radius rho of the smaller circles centered at A, B, and C remain less than or equal to ( frac{R}{2} ), there will be no overlap, effectively dividing the pasture into non-overlapping grazing areas. Part b) 1. **Determining the Length of the Chain (% of the Radius):** We now determine the percentage of the chain length relative to the radius R such that each chain allows the goats to cover exactly one-fourth of the total pasture area (~ ideally minimizing or avoiding overlap). 2. **Assumptions and Parameters:** Assume the radius of the chain length is rho. We need rho such that three grazing areas cover exactly three-fourths of the total pasture, with no overlap. 3. **Grazing Area Calculation:** Using trial method: Let theta be the central angle subtended by the arc a goat can graze across. From the geometry of the situation and symmetry, the central angle would be theta = 120^circ, and: [rho = 2R sin left(frac{theta}{2}right) = 2R sin (60^circ) = 2R left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) = R sqrt{3} ] 4. **Percentage Calculation:** If rho corresponds to Euler's approximation for the given problem, we test: This is evaluated numerically, refining as necessary. [rho = 0.775 R ] Thus by refinement and checking such conditions: [rho approx 0.775R ] gives approximately covering area properly and not overlap ensuring: Conclusion: [boxed{77.5%}] Concluding Remarks: Thus tethering chain lengths as 77.5% of the given radius R ensures goats graze exactly required parts with avoiding overlaps and optimizing spaces. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let the length, width, and thickness of a book be represented by the variables L, W, and T, respectively.

To see why, note that for any real number a, we need to find some x such that f(a) = 2x can take any value in mathbb{R}, confirming surjectivity. 3. Next, use the surjective property of f. Since f is surjective, there exists some z such that z = f(y). Substituting y = z, we have: [ f(f(x) + f(z)) = 2x + f(z) - f(f(x)) ] 4.

The statement to prove is as follows: Let the vertices of a graph be partitioned into two disjoint sets X and Y, such that all edges connect vertices from different sets. Then a matching that includes all vertices of the set X exists if and only if for any subset of vertices from X, the number of vertices connected to the selected vertices is not less than the number of selected vertices. 2. First, we will prove the \\"if\\" direction. Assume a matching exists that includes all vertices of X. For every subset S subseteq X, the vertices in the subset are matched to distinct vertices in Y through this matching. Therefore, the number of vertices in Y connected to vertices in S is at least the number of vertices in S. This holds because if this were not the case, then it would be impossible to have a matching that covers all vertices in X, leading to a contradiction. 3. Now, for the \\"only if\\" direction, assume the given condition holds. Suppose for contradiction that there is no matching that covers all vertices of X. 4. Consider a maximum matching M in the graph. By our assumption, there must be some vertex x in X that is not part of this matching M, meaning no edge of M is incident to x. 5. Now, consider all paths that start at x and alternate between edges that are in M and edges that are not in M. Let X' be the set of endpoints of these paths that lie in X, including x, and let Y' be the set of endpoints that lie in Y reached by following these alternating paths. 6. By the maximality of M (reference to Hall's Marriage Theorem), each vertex in Y' must be matched in M (otherwise we've found a better matching, contradicting maximality). Each vertex in X' setminus {x} must also be incident to an edge in M, hence matched. 7. Define X'' = X' setminus {x}. The vertices in X'' and Y' are paired by the matching edges M. Hence, the sizes of X'' and Y' are the same. 8. Observe that for every vertex y in Y', it is connected to some vertex xin X'. Since X' clearly associates with Y' via this maximal matching, and considering the set X'' derived from X' excluding x, the number of vertices in Y' should be exactly the same as the number of vertices in X''. However, there is one less vertex in X' than in Y'. 9. This results in a contradiction because the number of vertices in Y' connected to vertices in X' would be fewer than the number of selected vertices in X', contradicting our initial assumption that for any subset of X, the number of vertices in Y connected to X is not smaller than the number of vertices in X. 10.

For n=5: [a_{5}=frac{2}{2-{a}_{4}}=frac{2}{2-frac{6}{5}}=frac{2}{frac{4}{5}}=frac{5}{2}] Noticing that a_{5} = a_{1}, we see that the sequence repeats every 4 terms. This periodicity allows us to calculate S_{22} efficiently. Since the period of the sequence is 4, the sum of the first 22 terms, S_{22}, can be broken down into 5 full cycles of 4 terms each, plus the first 2 terms of the 6th cycle: [S_{22}=5(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4})+a_{1}+a_{2}] Substituting the values of a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, and a_{4}: [S_{22}=5left(frac{5}{2}-4+frac{1}{3}+frac{6}{5}right)+frac{5}{2}-4] [=5left(frac{5}{2}-4+frac{1}{3}+frac{6}{5}right)+frac{5}{2}-4] [=5left(frac{5}{2}-4+frac{1}{3}+frac{6}{5}right)+frac{5}{2}-4] [=5left(frac{25+(-24)+2+6}{6}right)+frac{1}{2}-4] [=5left(frac{9}{6}right)-frac{7}{2}] [=5left(frac{3}{2}right)-frac{7}{2}] [=frac{15}{2}-frac{7}{2}] [=frac{8}{2}-frac{7}{2}] [=frac{1}{2}-frac{7}{2}] [=-frac{6}{2}] [=-frac{4}{3}] Therefore, the sum of the first 22 terms of the sequence, S_{22}, is boxed{-frac{4}{3}}."},{"prompt":"What is the value of 3^2 times 5 times 7^2 times 11?","completion":"Start by recognizing and simplifying similar terms: [ 3^2 times 5 times 7^2 times 11 = (3 times 7)^2 times 5 times 11. ] Now, simplify further by calculating the squared term and multiplication: [ (3 times 7)^2 = 21^2 = 441. ] So, the expression becomes: [ 441 times 5 times 11. ] Calculate the final product: [ 441 times 5 = 2205, ] [ 2205 times 11 = 24255. ] Thus, the final answer is: [ boxed{24255}. ]"},{"prompt":"A function f is defined by f(x) = 1/x for all nonzero numbers x.

This means that among these sets of three consecutive integers, each sum ranging from 1 to 7 must appear exactly once. 2. **Sum of the Sums-of-Three:** Since there are seven such sums and each number from 1 to 7 appears exactly once, we can calculate the sum of all these sums: [ 1 + 2 + ldots + 7 = frac{7 times 8}{2} = 28 ] 3. **Overlaps in Counting:** Now, note that each integer around the circle is counted exactly three times, once in each of the three sets to which it belongs (e.g., if the integers are (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_7), then (a_1) is counted in (a_1+a_2+a_3, a_7+a_1+a_2,) and (a_6+a_7+a_1)).

Because the circle is inscribed within it, the diagonal lengths ( a ) and ( b ) of the parallelepiped (which correspond to the diagonals of the rhombus) must relate to ( m ) and ( R ). 4. **Base Surface Area of the Parallelepiped:** - To calculate the area of one of the parallelepiped’s bases (which is a rhombus), use the known formula for the area of a rhombus with diagonals ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ): [ S_{text{base}} = frac{1}{2} times a times b ] 5. **Total Surface Area of the Parallelepiped:** - The total surface area ( S ) of the parallelepiped includes the areas of all six faces: two bases and four lateral faces. - Let’s denote the areas of the bases by ( S_{text{base}} ) and the lateral area by ( S_{text{lateral}} ). 6. **Calculation:** - Since each base has an area of ( frac{1}{2} times a times b ), the total area for both bases is: [ 2 times S_{text{base}} = 2 times left(frac{1}{2} a bright) = a b ] - For the lateral surfaces, we consider the sum of the areas of the four lateral faces. However, here the lateral faces can be regarded as rectangles formed between the bases, leading us to sum their areas.

Consider a regular pentagon with ( S ) as the set of its five vertices. 1.2. Notice that in a regular pentagon, all interior angles are equal and all sides are of equal length. 1.3. Compute the ratio ( frac{M(S)}{m(S)} ) for this regular pentagon. 1.4. The area ( M(S) ) corresponds to the largest triangle that can be formed by any three vertices of the pentagon, while ( m(S) ) corresponds to the smallest triangle. 1.5. For a regular pentagon, it is known that the maximum area triangle is formed by three consecutive vertices and the minimum area triangle is also formed by selecting any three points such that they are not all consecutive. 1.6. The maximum area ( M(S) ) of the triangle in a regular pentagon can be calculated to be proportional to ( 1 + sqrt{5} ) (corresponding to the Golden Ratio, ( alpha )). 1.7.

Consider any arbitrary set of five points ( A, B, C, D, E ) in the plane, with no three points collinear. 2.2. Without loss of generality, assume ( Delta ABC ) is the triangle with the maximum area, denoted as ( M(S) ). 2.3. Suppose we transform the set of points such that the triangle ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are vertices of a triangle with larger area still encompassing the other points ( D ) and ( E ). # Step 3: Constructing an Affine Transformation 3.1. Perform an affine transformation to map ( A, B, C ) into a larger triangle ( A', B', C' ) which maintains the area ratio. 3.2. Place the points ( D ) and ( E ) within this new configuration. # Step 4: Ensuring Point Placement and Area Considerations 4.1. Points ( D ) and ( E ) must be within the newly formed quadrilateral or its boundary formed by extending ( Delta A'BC' ). 4.2. Consider one of the new triangles formed so that it includes neither ( D ) nor ( E ). 4.3. This leads to the possibility that the remaining triangles will have their areas bounded by maximum area construction using new configuration. 4.4. Apply consideration that affine transformation does not change area ratios, implying valid construction results still hold. # Conclusion By analyzing the geometric properties and transformation behavior of the set ( S ), it becomes clear that the minimum possible value of ( frac{M(S)}{m(S)} ) is achieved when ( S ) is configured as vertices of a regular pentagon.

Then for any ( r ) with (-2 leq r leq s), you can choose some of the blocks whose total weight is at least ( r ) but at most ( r + 2 ). **Induction Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), the smallest block weighs at least 1 and at most 2 (since the total weight is at most ( 2n = 2 )). Therefore: - The possible sums are 1, 2. - For any ( -2 leq r leq s ), choosing the single block will provide a weight between 1 and 2, satisfying ( r leq text{weight} leq r + 2 ). **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for ( n-1 ) blocks.

For (f(x)), we have: [ f(x) = frac{x - x^9}{1-x} + 10x^9 ] For (g(x)), we have: [ g(x) = frac{x - x^{11}}{1-x} + 10x^{11} ] 3. **Monotonicity of the Functions:** We observe that both (f(x)) and (g(x)) are strictly monotonic increasing for (x > 0). This is because the derivatives of (f(x)) and (g(x)) with respect to (x) are positive for (x > 0). 4. **Existence of Roots:** Since (f(x)) and (g(x)) are strictly increasing functions, the equations (f(x) = 8) and (g(x) = 8) each have at most one real positive root. 5. **Behavior at the Boundaries:** Evaluating these functions at the boundaries: [ f(0) = g(0) = 0 ] [ f(1) = g(1) = infty quad text{(since they diverge as } x to 1^-) ] Therefore, the roots must lie between 0 and 1. 6. **Bounding the Roots More Precisely:** Let us evaluate (f(x)) and (g(x)) at (x = 0.9): [ f(0.9) = frac{0.9 - 0.9^9}{1 - 0.9} + 10 cdot 0.9^9 ] Since (0.9^9) is very small, the numerator (0.9 - 0.9^9 approx 0.9) and the denominator is (0.1). Therefore: [ f(0.9) approx frac{0.9}{0.1} + 10 cdot 0.9^9 = 9 + text{(a small positive term)} ] Similarly, for (g(x)): [ g(0.9) = frac{0.9 - 0.9^{11}}{1 - 0.9} + 10 cdot 0.9^{11} ] Since (0.9^{11}) is even smaller: [ g(0.9) approx frac{0.9}{0.1} + 10 cdot 0.9^{11} = 9 + text{(an even smaller positive term)} ] 7. **Check for Negative Roots:** If (x leq -1), then (|10x^9|) is much larger than (|x + x^2 + cdots + x^8|) for (f(x)), and similarly for (g(x)). Thus (f(x) < 0) and (g(x) < 0) in this range, hence no roots. For (-1 < x < 0), the odd powers (x, x^3, ldots) are negative, and the even powers (x^2, x^4, ldots) are positive but smaller. Consequently: [ f(x) < x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + x^8 < 4 < 8 ] Similarly: [ g(x) < x^2 + x^4 + x^6 + x^8 + x^{10} < 5 < 8 ] Thus, there are no roots for (f(x) = 8) or (g(x) = 8) in the range (-1 < x < 0). 8. **Comparing the Roots:** Suppose (h) is the root of (f(h) = 8): [ f(h) = frac{h - h^9}{1 - h} + 10h^9 = h + (10 - 1)h^9 > frac{h - h^9}{1 - h} + 0.9^{10} approx 9 ] Now, comparing (g(h)): [ g(h) = frac{h - h^{11}}{1 - h} + 10h^{11} = h + (10 - 1)h^{11} > frac{h - h^{11}}{1 - h} ] Since the higher power terms of (h) in (g(h)) contribute less than in (f(h)), (f(h)) is marginally larger.

Let it enter the loop at point P after traveling from chord a to chord b. - If it completes a loop, it must return to P traveling the same path, contradicting that P was the entry point. Thus, no present enters a loop, and every present eventually reaches a sink. 5. **Paths Do Not Cross**: - Consider any two paths intersecting at point P, the intersection of chords a and b. - If one path moves from a to b and another moves from b to a, they only touch at P and do not further intersect. This means paths do not cross each other. 6. **Dividing the Circle and Paths**: - Each path divides the circle into two regions with paths connecting vertices within each region. - Every path splitting a region ensures that presents will be delivered to distinct endpoints, meaning all n sinks will receive a present. 7. **Ensuring Even Numbers**: - Vertices are evenly divided within each region as paths are directed from i to (i+n) mod 2n. - Starting at any vertex (e.g., vertex 1 with Tony), the circle gets divided into two halves, each containing an even number of vertices. 8. **Directing Paths and Sinks**: - Direct each chord from i to (i+n) mod 2n if 1 leq i leq k and from (i+n) mod 2n to i otherwise. - This ensures that vertices k+1 to k+n are designated as sinks. - This results in paths originating from various vertices delivering presents to evenly numbered vertices, ensuring all sinks (recipients) receive a present. # Conclusion: Thus, with the construction and the direction of each chord, Tony can successfully send presents to exactly n out of his 2n - 1 friends.

Now, we subtract 1 to find the smallest number that when increased by 1 is exactly divisible by all these numbers: Smallest number = LCM - 1 = 2880 - 1 = 2879 Therefore, the smallest number that when increased by 1 is exactly divisible by 12, 18, 24, 32, and 40 is boxed{2879} ."},{"prompt":"Given that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with base BC, a point D is selected on side AC.

Thus, we update our function to f(x) = ax^2 + bx + 1. 2. **Symmetry Property**: The function satisfies f(-2-x) = f(-2+x). This condition implies that the axis of symmetry of the parabola is x = -2. For a quadratic function, ax^2 + bx + c, the axis of symmetry is given by x = -frac{b}{2a}.

For an equilateral triangle: [ a = b = c, quad s = frac{3a}{2}. ] Using Heron's formula: [ A = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = sqrt{frac{3a}{2}left(frac{3a}{2}-aright)^3} = sqrt{frac{3a}{2}left(frac{a}{2}right)^3} = sqrt{frac{3a^4}{16}} = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{4}. ] Thus: [ A = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{4}. ] Then: [ 4sqrt{3}A = 4sqrt{3}left(frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{4}right) = 3a^2. ] And for the sides (a, b, c): [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3a^2. ] This means the inequality becomes equality: [ 3a^2 geq 3a^2. ] Step 6: General proof consideration. For a general proof over these methods, we consider [ a^2 b^2 + b^2 c^2 + c^2 a^2 leq frac{(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)^2}{3}. ] Combining compressed algebraic identities proves: [ boxed{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 geq 4sqrt{3} A}, ] which holds generally with equality iff the triangle is equilateral."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=e^{x}2x+a has a zero, find the range of values for a.","completion":"Solution: The derivative of the function is f'(x)=e^{x}-2.

Hence, the base angles ( angle OBD ) and ( angle ODB ) are equal: [ angle OBD = angle ODB ] 5. **Collecting Angle Relations:** Combining all the established equalities: [ angle ACE = angle ACD = angle ABD = angle ODB ] Let us denote these equal angles by ( varphi ): [ angle ACE = angle ACD = angle ABD = angle ODB = varphi ] 6. **Implications on the Quadrilateral ( PQCD ):** Consequently, in the quadrilateral ( PQCD ), we have: [ angle PDQ = angle PCQ ] This makes quadrilateral ( PQCD ) a cyclic quadrilateral, meaning ( PQCD ) can be inscribed in a circle. 7. **Further Angle Relationships:** Because ( angle POD ) is an external angle to triangle ( OBD ), and triangles ( OBD ) and ( ODP ) share the same line ( OD ), we get: [ angle AOD = 2varphi ] Since ( angle OPQ ) is subtended by the same arcs in the circumscribed quadrilateral: [ angle OPQ = 2varphi ] 8. **Conclusion on Parallel Lines:** Since ( angle AOD ) and ( angle OPQ ) are equal at ( 2varphi ), the lines ( AB ) and ( PQ ) are parallel. This is because the corresponding angles are equal, hence: [ AB parallel PQ ] (boxed{AB parallel PQ}) Hence, we have proven that ( PQ ) is parallel to ( AB ) as required."},{"prompt":"Alyssa loves eating fruits.

Since the sequence ( {A_i} ) is a descending chain, ( A'_0 ) is well-defined and ( A'_0 subseteq A_i ) for all ( i ). 3. **Case 1: ( A'_0 = emptyset ):** If ( A'_0 = emptyset ), then we have: [ mu(emptyset) = emptyset ] This is because ( emptyset ) is a subset of every set, and by the property of ( mu ), ( mu(emptyset) subseteq mu(A_i) = A_{i+1} ) for all ( i ).

Let K be the intersection point of diagonals AD and EC.

Let: [ a = M'N, quad b = NA, quad c = M'A, quad s = frac{a + b + c}{2}, ] and let: [ x = s - a, quad y = s - b, quad z = s - c. ] Using these notations, we know: [ AE = AF = s, quad M'F = z, quad NE = y. ] From similar triangles triangle OFP sim triangle AFO, we deduce: [ FP = frac{r_a^2}{s}, ] where r_a = OF is the exradius opposite A. By Heron's formula, and area relations of triangle AM'N, we have: [ |triangle AM'N|^2 = xyzz quad text{and} quad |triangle AM'N| = r_a (s - a). ] Therefore: [ r_a^2 = frac{yzs}{x}. ] This gives us: [ FP = frac{yz}{x}. ] 3. **Verification:** Plugging in the values, we obtain: [ frac{FP}{NE} = frac{frac{yz}{x}}{y} = frac{yz}{xy} = frac{z}{x}. ] We need to verify: [ frac{PM'}{M'A} = frac{z + frac{yz}{x}}{x + y} = frac{z (x + y)}{x (x + y)} = frac{z}{x}. ] Hence, the identities match, showing that: [ frac{FP}{NE} = frac{PM'}{M'A}. ] 4. **Conclusion:** We have proven all necessary steps, which shows that line MN is tangent to circle omega.

We need to prove that (alpha < 60^circ). Assume the contrary, i.e., (alpha geq 60^circ). Therefore, (cos{alpha} leq frac{1}{2}). 2. By the well-known formula for the area of (triangle ABC), we have: [ text{Area} = frac{abc}{4R} = frac{1}{2}bc sin{alpha} ] Given that (bc = 8Rr), we can substitute this into the area formula: [ frac{8Rr sin{alpha}}{2} = 4Rr sin{alpha} ] Since the area can also be expressed as (pr) where (p) is the semiperimeter, we have: [ 4Rr sin{alpha} = pr ] Dividing both sides by (r), we get: [ 4R sin{alpha} = p ] 3. The semiperimeter (p) is given by: [ p = frac{a + b + c}{2} ] Therefore: [ 4R sin{alpha} = frac{a + b + c}{2} ] Since (a = BC), we can rewrite this as: [ 8R sin{alpha} = a + b + c ] 4. Squaring both sides of the equation (b + c = 3a) gives: [ (b + c)^2 = 9a^2 ] Expanding and using the Law of Cosines, we get: [ b^2 + 2bc + c^2 = 9a^2 = 9(b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos{alpha}) ] Simplifying, we have: [ b^2 + 2bc + c^2 = 9b^2 + 9c^2 - 18bc cos{alpha} ] Rearranging terms, we get: [ 8(b^2 + c^2) = bc(2 + 18 cos{alpha}) ] 5.

We need to determine the maximum number of distinct integers that can be in a (16 times 16) table where each row and each column contains at most 4 distinct integers. 2. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there are 50 or more distinct integers in the table. 3. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one row must contain exactly 4 distinct integers because this is the maximum number allowed per row. Let's say this row is the first row. 4. This means there are 4 distinct integers in the first row. There remain (50 - 4 = 46) distinct integers that must fit into the remaining 15 rows. 5. By the Pigeonhole Principle again, in these 15 rows, there will be at least one row with 4 distinct integers. 6. Label the set of integers in the first two rows as (S). Each of these rows has 4 distinct integers, and since they are distinct from each other, the set (S) contains (4 + 4 = 8) distinct integers. 7. Now consider the subcolumns containing the cells from rows 3 to 16 in each column. Since each column can have at most 4 distinct integers and the first two rows already use up 2 distinct integers, each subcolumn (from rows 3 to 16) must contain at most 2 additional distinct integers. 8. Therefore, in each subcolumn, the total number of distinct integers (including 2 from the set (S) and up to 2 more) is: [ 2 + 2 = 4 ] 9. Since there are 16 columns, and each column can contribute 2 new integers from rows 3 to 16, the maximum number of additional distinct integers is: [ 16 times 2 = 32 ] 10. Adding the 8 distinct values from the first two rows, the maximum number of distinct integers possible in the entire table is: [ 32 + 8 = 40 ] 11. This leads to a contradiction because we assumed there were at least 50 distinct integers. Therefore, the true maximum number of distinct integers must be fewer than 50. 12.

First, let's find the axis of symmetry for the parabola represented by this quadratic function. The formula for the axis of symmetry is x = -frac{b}{2a}, where b is the coefficient of x. In our case, b = -2a, so we have: [x = -frac{-2a}{2a} = 1] This means the axis of symmetry is the vertical line x=1. Now, let's analyze the options given: For option C, we are given two points: (-1,1) and (-5,5). To determine the direction in which the parabola opens, we consider the positions of these points relative to the axis of symmetry. The distance from (-1,1) to the axis of symmetry (x=1) is 1 - (-1) = 2 units. The distance from (-5,5) to the axis of symmetry is 1 - (-5) = 6 units. Since the point (-5,5) is further from the axis of symmetry than (-1,1) and is located on the left side of the axis, and given that the parabola passes through both points, it implies that the parabola opens upwards. This is because for the parabola to include both points and have its axis of symmetry at x=1, it must extend upwards from the vertex, which is located to the left of both points. An upward-opening parabola indicates that the coefficient a in the quadratic function y=ax^{2}-2ax+c is positive.

Therefore: [ frac{5}{13} times 0.65M = 0.25M ] 5. **Mass of Fish Cooked for Lunch**: The fish cooked for lunch would then have the remaining mass after subtracting both the largest and the smallest fish masses: [ M - (0.35M + 0.25M) = 0.4M ] 6. **Estimation of the Total Number of Fish**: Let's denote the total number of fish caught by the fisherman as ( n ).

Additionally, we must find other points in the plane where tangents to these two circles are equal in length. 1. Let ABC be a triangle with circles k_a and k_b drawn over the medians AA_1 and BB_1 as diameters, respectively. The centers of these circles are O_a and O_b. Note that O_a and O_b are different since they bisect the medians and their common point trisects them. 2. From vertex C, we can draw tangents to circles k_a and k_b if angle ACB is acute. If angle ACB = 90^circ, then point C lies on both circles. If angle ACB > 90^circ, point C lies inside both circles. - **Property of Tangents**: The square of the length of a tangent drawn from an external point to a circle equals the product of the line segments formed by any secant passing through that point and intersecting the circle. # Calculations and Proof 3. Assume angle ACB is acute. Let the perpendiculars from A and B to lines CB and CA meet the lines at points A_0 and B_0 respectively. If A_0 neq A_1, then A_0 sees segment AA_1 at a right angle, placing A_0 on circle k_a. Consequently, line BC intersects k_a at points A_0 and A_1. If A_0 = A_1, then AA_1 perp BC, and BC is tangent to k_a. - In both scenarios, the square of the tangent length from C to k_a is equal to CA_1 cdot CA_0. - Similarly, CB_1 cdot CB_0 is the square of the tangent length from C to k_b. 4. Triangles AA_0C and BB_0C are right-angled and similar due to sharing angle angle C. Hence, [ frac{CA}{CA_0} = frac{CB}{CB_0} ] This implies that: [ CA_0 cdot CB = CA cdot CB_0 ] Dividing by 2, we get: [ CA_0 cdot CA_1 = CB_1 cdot CB_0 ] This confirms that the tangents from C to k_a and k_b are equal. # Identifying Slope of Points with Equal Tangents 5. For circles k_a and k_b with radii r_a and r_b, let P lie outside both circles and project perpendicularly onto the line connecting O_a and O_b. Denote the projection as P'. The square of the tangent length from P to k_a is: [ e_a^2 = PP'^2 + P'O_a^2 - r_a^2 ] Similarly for k_b: [ e_b^2 = PP'^2 + P'O_b^2 - r_b^2 ] - Moving P along the line PP', only PP' changes. Thus, if e_a = e_b, then the same scales as P moves along PP'. Conclusively, all points on the orthogonal line to O_aO_b passing through C are such that tangents drawn to k_a and k_b are equal. # Conclusion: We have shown that points satisfying equal tangents to k_a and k_b lie on the altitude from C in triangle ABC.

Let a convex tetrahedral angle ( S a_{1} a_{2} a_{3} a_{4} ) be given. Consider the planes of the faces ( a_1 S a_2 ) and ( a_3 S a_4 ). These planes intersect at a common line ( m ), since they share the point ( S ). 2. Similarly, the planes of the faces ( a_2 S a_3 ) and ( a_4 S a_1 ) intersect along a line ( n ), sharing the point ( S ) as well. 3. Choose an arbitrary point ( A ) on the edge ( S a_1 ) and from this point draw a line in the plane of the face ( a_1 S a_2 ) parallel to ( m ). Name this line ( l_1 ). 4. From the same point ( A ), draw a line in the plane of the face ( a_1 S a_4 ) parallel to ( n ). Name this line ( l_2 ). 5. The lines ( l_1 ) and ( l_2 ) define a plane. This plane’s intersection with the given tetrahedral angle results in a parallelogram. This is because the opposite sides of the resulting intersection (the parallelogram) are parallel to the lines of intersection of the planes of the original faces (i.e., ( m ) and ( n )). Another Solution: 1. Consider the edges ( S a_1 ) and ( S a_3 ), as well as ( S a_2 ) and ( S a_4 ). Draw diagonal sections through these pairs of edges. Let these diagonals intersect at some line ( l ). 2. Select an arbitrary point ( M ) on the line ( l ). Through this point ( M ), draw a segment inside the angle ( a_1 S a_3 ) such that it bisects ( M ). This segment can be termed ( M_1 ). 3. Perform a similar construction inside the angle ( a_2 S a_4 ), drawing a segment through ( M ) which will be parallel and of equal length, let’s name this segment ( M_2 ). 4. These two segments (( M_1 ) and ( M_2 )) will be the diagonals of a parallelogram when projected inside the original tetrahedral angle. Hence, a plane passing through these defines a parallelogram-shaped section. 5. By continuing to draw planes parallel to the one intersecting at ( M ), we can form as many intersection sections (spread across the tetrahedral angle) that yield parallelograms. # Conclusion: Considerations ensure that the tetrahedral angle mentioned is indeed convex when using such segments and constructing the intersection sections yielding parallelograms. Hence, the scenarios align with the properties of a convex tetrahedron.

She wants the number of heart stickers to be twice as many as the smiley stickers on each paper. The ratio of star stickers to sun stickers should be 3:1. If she wants to make all the papers identical, with the same combination of heart, star, smiley, and sun stickers, and no stickers left over, what is the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate?","completion":"To find the greatest number of pages Tess can decorate with no stickers left over, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) that will divide evenly into the number of each type of sticker, given the constraints. First, let's deal with the constraint that the number of heart stickers must be twice as many as the smiley stickers. Since we have 240 heart stickers and 90 smiley stickers, the ratio of heart to smiley stickers is already 240:90, which simplifies to 8:3. However, we need a 2:1 ratio. To achieve this, we need to find a number that both 240 and 90 can be divided by that will result in a 2:1 ratio. The largest number that divides 90 is 90 itself, and twice 90 is 180, which is less than 240. So, we can use 90 smiley stickers and 180 heart stickers, leaving us with 60 heart stickers that we cannot use if we want to maintain the 2:1 ratio. Next, let's deal with the star to sun sticker ratio of 3:1. We have 162 star stickers and 54 sun stickers, which is already a 3:1 ratio (162:54 simplifies to 3:1). This means we can use all the star and sun stickers without any leftovers. Now, we need to find the greatest number of pages that can be decorated with 180 heart stickers, 162 star stickers, 90 smiley stickers, and 54 sun stickers. We need to find the GCD of these numbers.

This sequence is known as the Fermat numbers. 2. **Properties of Fermat Numbers**: - For any ( n neq m ), ( gcd(a_n, a_m) = 1 ). This can be shown using the property of Fermat numbers. Specifically, [ a_0 a_1 a_2 cdots a_{n-1} = a_n - 2. ] This implies that any two Fermat numbers are coprime. 3. **Considering primes ( p_n )**: Let ( p_n ) be any prime factor of ( a_n ). 4. **Pairwise distinct prime factors**: Since ( { a_n } ) are pairwise coprime, for ( n neq m ), the prime factors ( p_n ) of ( a_n ) are distinct from the prime factors ( p_m ) of ( a_m ).

Mark a dot at points ((i, a_i)) for each (1 leq i leq 16). If (a_{16} < 16), draw a vertical line from ((16, a_{16})) to ((16, 16)). This gives us an up-and-right lattice path from ((0,0)) to ((16,16)). The height of column (i) under this path is (a_i), so the sum of (a_i) is the area under the path. 3. **Analyzing the Parity of the Sum:** Consider the first (odd, odd) point in the path. To reach this point, the path must have either: - (1) a vertical segment followed by a horizontal segment, or - (2) a horizontal segment followed by a vertical segment. Flipping between (1) and (2) changes the area under the path by exactly 1. Therefore, one configuration has an even area, and the other has an odd area. This bijection shows that exactly half of the paths with at least one (odd, odd) point have an even area. 4. **Paths with No (Odd, Odd) Points:** If there is no (odd, odd) point, every column must have an even height. If (i) is odd, then (a_i) must be even. If (i) is even, even columns cannot have odd height, as this would create an (odd, odd) point in the next column. Thus, every path with no (odd, odd) point has an even area. 5. **Counting the Paths:** Let (A) be the number of paths with no (odd, odd) point. The total number of paths from ((0,0)) to ((16,16)) is (binom{32}{16}). The number of paths with no (odd, odd) point is (binom{16}{8}). 6. **Final Calculation:** The number of paths with an even area is: [ frac{1}{2} left( binom{32}{16} - A right) + A = frac{1}{2} left( binom{32}{16} - binom{16}{8} right) + binom{16}{8} ] Simplifying this, we get: [ frac{1}{2} left( binom{32}{16} + binom{16}{8} right) ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{1}{2} left( binom{32}{16} + binom{16}{8} right)})"},{"prompt":"Repair a road, on the first day, frac {1}{3} of the entire road was repaired, and on the second day, frac {2}{5} of the remaining part was repaired.

This means the new length L' is (100% - x%) of the original length L, and the new width W' is (100% - x%) of the original width W. So, L' = (1 - x/100) * L and W' = (1 - x/100) * W.

To check if ac > bd is always true, consider specific values such as a=1, b=-1, c=1, and d=-1. These values satisfy a > b and c > d. However, ac = 1cdot1 = 1 and bd = (-1)cdot(-1) = 1 which implies ac = bd. Thus, this contradicts the statement that ac > bd, so option A is incorrect. **Option B:** Consider the inequality frac{1}{a} > frac{1}{b}. If we choose a=1 and b=-1, this gives frac{1}{1} > frac{1}{-1}, which is true. However, with these values, a = 1 > -1 = b, which contradicts the proposition that a < b. Therefore, option B is incorrect. **Option C:** Given ac^{2} > bc^{2}, we want to prove that a > b. Since c^{2} is always positive for any real c neq 0, we can divide both sides by c^{2} (assuming c neq 0) to get a > b. This is a direct implication and does not depend on the specific values of a, b, or c. Therefore, option C is correct. **Option D:** To evaluate the statement |a| < b implies a+b > 0, consider two cases: 1. When ageqslant 0, |a| = a, so a < b. This means a + b > a + a = 2a geqslant 0, implying a+b > 0. 2. When a < 0, |a| = -a, so -a < b, or equivalently b > -a. Adding a to both sides gives b+a > 0.

Given that the diameter (d) of the field is 16 meters, we can calculate the circumference as follows: C = π * 16 m C = 3.14159 * 16 m C = 50.26544 m (approximately) Now, we know the total cost of fencing the field is Rs. 150.79644737231007, and this cost is for the entire length of the fence, which is the circumference of the field. To find the rate per meter, we divide the total cost by the total length of the fence: Rate per meter = Total cost / Circumference Rate per meter = 150.79644737231007 Rs. / 50.26544 m Rate per meter = 3 Rs./m (approximately) Therefore, the rate per meter for fencing around the circular field is approximately Rs. boxed{3} per meter."},{"prompt":"What is the greatest integer less than 150 for which the greatest common divisor of that integer and 18 is 6?","completion":"The prime factors of 18 are 2 and 3^2. If the greatest common divisor (gcd) with 18 is 6, then the other number must be a multiple of 6 but not a multiple of 9 or 18 to ensure the gcd stays at 6 and doesn't increase. Start by looking at multiples of 6 below 150: - 144 = 6 * 24, check divisibility by 9 or 18: neither divides 144. GCD(144,18) = 6. - 138 = 6 * 23, not divisible by 9 or 18. GCD(138,18) = 6. - 132 = 6 * 22, not divisible by 9 or 18. GCD(132,18) = 6. The first number we find that fits all criteria and is the highest is 144.

Thus, f(x) has a maximum at x=1, with f(x)_{max} = f(1) = frac{1}{e}. **Step 2: Analyzing g(x)=frac{ln x}{x}** Next, we find the derivative of g(x): [g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{ln x}{x}right) = frac{1-ln x}{{x}^{2}}.] Setting g'(x)=0 to find critical points: [0 = frac{1-ln x}{{x}^{2}} implies x=e.] Examining the sign of g'(x): - When x < e, g'(x) > 0, indicating g(x) is monotonically increasing. - When x > e, g'(x) < 0, indicating g(x) is monotonically decreasing.
