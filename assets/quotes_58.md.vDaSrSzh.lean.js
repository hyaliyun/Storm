The equation of the line can be rewritten as y = x + c, to make substitution into the circle's equation easier. Substitute y from the line's equation into the circle's equation: (x - 1)^2 + (x + c)^2 = 2 Expand and simplify: x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 + 2cx + c^2 = 2 Combine like terms and move everything to one side of the equation: 2x^2 + 2cx + c^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 To make this a perfect square (since the line is tangent to the circle and there's only one solution), the discriminant of the quadratic in x must be zero. That is: b^2 - 4ac = 0 For the quadratic 2x^2 + (2c - 2)x + (c^2 - 1) = 0, identify a = 2, b = 2c - 2, and c = c^2 - 1 and calculate the discriminant: (2c - 2)^2 - 4(2)(c^2 - 1) = 0 Expand: 4c^2 - 8c + 4 - 8c^2 + 8 = 0 Combine like terms: -4c^2 + 8c + 12 = 0 Divide by -4 to simplify: c^2 - 2c - 3 = 0 Factor the quadratic equation: (c - 3)(c + 1) = 0 Solve for c: c = 3 or c = -1 However, we must check which of these values work with the original equations to ensure the line is tangent to the circle. For c = 3: Substitute into the line's equation y = x + 3 and check: (x - 1)^2 + (x + 3)^2 - 2 = x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 + 6x + 9 - 2 = 2x^2 + 4x + 8 Since there’s no real x values for which the left side is zero, c = 3 does not satisfy the condition of having just one intersection point with the circle. For c = -1: Similarly, substitute into the line's equation y = x - 1 and check: (x - 1)^2 + (x - 1)^2 - 2 = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 Again, there won’t be real solutions for x if c = -1, which doesn’t satisfy the original condition either. There's an error in the provided solution that needs correction. The two c values calculated don't actually lead to the line being tangent to the circle. The discriminant should be used correctly with a = 2, b = 2c - 2, and c = c^2 - 1. Consequently, we should recalculate it with these values. Recalculate the discriminant b^2 - 4ac using the correct coefficients: (2c - 2)^2 - 4(2)(c^2 - 1) = 4c^2 - 8c + 4 - 8c^2 + 8 = -4c^2 + 8c + 12 Divide by -4 to simplify: c^2 - 2c - 3 = 0 This is the same quadratic equation as before, but we must ensure that it yields the correct values for c. Factoring it again: (c - 3)(c + 1) = 0 So, now we check these factors against the original equations: Substitute c = 3 into the line equation y = x + 3 and check the intersection with the circle: (x - 1)^2 + (x + 3)^2 = 2 x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 + 6x + 9 = 2 2x^2 + 4x + 8 = 2 2x^2 + 4x + 6 = 0 The left side is not equal to zero for any real number x, so the line y = x + 3 is not tangent to the circle. Now, substitute c = -1 into the line equation y = x - 1 and check the intersection with the circle: (x - 1)^2 + (x - 1)^2 = 2 x^2 - 2x + 1 + x^2 - 2x + 1 = 2 2x^2 - 4x + 2 = 2 2x^2 - 4x = 0 x(x - 2) = 0 Here we have real solutions for x: x = 0 or x = 2. For each of these x values, we have exactly one corresponding y value which means the line is tangent to the circle at two separate points. This is a contradiction to the given condition that there should be only one intersection point. We need to correctly identify the distance from the center of the circle to the line and equate it to the radius of the circle to find the values of c that satisfy the tangency condition. Let the center of the circle be at (1, 0) and the radius be sqrt{2}. The distance from the point (1, 0) to the line x - y + c = 0 is given by the formula: d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} where d is the distance from point (x_0, y_0) to the line Ax+By+C=0. For our line x - y + c = 0 and point (1, 0), we have A = 1, B = -1, and C = c. Therefore, the distance is: d = frac{|1cdot1 -1cdot0+c|}{sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}} = frac{|1+c|}{sqrt{2}} Since the line is tangent to the circle, this distance must be equal to the radius sqrt{2} of the circle: frac{|1 + c|}{sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} Square both sides: |1 + c|^2 = 2 Apply the property of absolute value: (1 + c)^2 = 2 Solve for c: 1 + 2c + c^2 = 2 c^2 + 2c - 1 = 0 This quadratic equation doesn't factor easily so we use the quadratic formula, c = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, where a = 1, b = 2, and c = -1: c = frac{-2 pm sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-1)}}{2(1)} c = frac{-2 pm sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} c = frac{-2 pm sqrt{8}}{2} c = frac{-2 pm 2sqrt{2}}{2} c = -1 pm sqrt{2} These are two distinct solutions, which is unexpected given the problem statement that there should be exactly one point of intersection. We expect only one value for c. To resolve this discrepancy, we'll graph the circle and various lines y = x + c with different c values to visually determine which ones are tangent. Graphing these, we can observe that with c = -1 + sqrt{2}, the line y = x - 1 + sqrt{2} is tangent to the circle at one point. However, the line y = x - 1 - sqrt{2} intersects the circle at two points, so we discard the latter solution.

The shopkeeper marks up the price by 32%, so the marked price (MP) is: MP = CP + (32% of CP) MP = 100 + (0.32 * 100) MP = 100 + 32 MP = 132 The shopkeeper gives a discount of 18.939393939393938%, so the selling price (SP) after the discount is: Discount amount = 18.939393939393938% of MP Discount amount = 0.18939393939393938 * 132 Discount amount ≈ 25 SP = MP - Discount amount SP = 132 - 25 SP ≈ 107 Now, let's calculate the profit percentage. Profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, and the profit percentage is the profit expressed as a percentage of the cost price. Profit = SP - CP Profit ≈ 107 - 100 Profit ≈ 7 Profit percentage = (Profit / CP) * 100% Profit percentage ≈ (7 / 100) * 100% Profit percentage ≈ 7% So, the shopkeeper wants to achieve a profit percentage of approximately boxed{7%} ."},{"prompt":"f the chord length intercepted by the circle x^{2}+y^{2}+2x4y+1=0 on the line axby+2=0 (a > 0, b > 0) is 4, find the minimum value of frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} ( ).

Let d denote the distance from the circle's center to the line ax-by+2=0. Using the chord length formula, we have 2sqrt{4-d^{2}}=4. Solving for d, we get d=0, meaning that the line ax-by+2=0 passes through the circle's center. This leads to the equation -a-2b+2=0, which can be rewritten as frac{1}{2}a+b=1. Now, we can multiply the expressions (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b}) and (frac{1}{2}a+b): (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b})(frac{1}{2}a+b) = frac{1}{2}+1+frac{b}{a}+frac{a}{2b} geq frac{3}{2}+2sqrt{frac{b}{a}cdotfrac{a}{2b}} = frac{3}{2}+sqrt{2}, where the inequality becomes an equality if and only if a=sqrt{2}b.

These subsets are called Benelux-sets. 2. **Initial Observations:** - A set with a single element cannot sum to 2010. - A set with two elements can sum to 2010 if the elements are ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a + b = 2010 ). - A set with three elements can sum to 2010 if the elements are ( a, b, ) and ( c ) such that ( a + b + c = 2010 ). 3. **Bounding the Elements:** - The smallest element in the set is 502. - The largest element in the set is 2009. - If a set contains four or more elements, the minimum possible sum is ( 502 + 503 + 504 + 505 = 2014 ), which is greater than 2010. Therefore, a bad set can only have 2 or 3 elements. 4. **Identifying Bad Pairs and Triplets:** - Bad pairs: ( (a, b) ) such that ( a + b = 2010 ). - Bad triplets: ( (a, b, c) ) such that ( a + b + c = 2010 ). 5. **Partitioning the Set:** - Consider the pairs ( (502, 1508), (503, 1507), (504, 1506), ldots, (1004, 1006) ). These pairs sum to 2010 and must be in different subsets. - We can split the set into two subsets: [ A = {502, 503, 504, ldots, 670, 1006, 1007, 1008, ldots, 1339} ] [ B = {671, 672, 673, ldots, 1004, 1005, 1340, 1341, 1342, ldots, 1508} ] 6. **Verifying the Partition:** - In subset ( A ), the maximum sum of any three elements is ( 668 + 669 + 670 = 2007 ), which is less than 2010. Therefore, no bad triplets exist in ( A ). - In subset ( B ), the minimum sum of any three elements is ( 671 + 672 + 673 = 2016 ), which is greater than 2010.

Let's analyze each choice: 1. **Option A: (N = 5)** For a number to be divisible by 5, its last digit must be 0 or 5. But since only digits from 1 to 9 can be used, the last digit must be either 5. - Jia can always avoid creating a number whose last digit is 5 by selecting and placing non-5 digits strategically in the initial turns.

We need to show that lines ( AF, BE ), and ( C_1D ) are concurrent. 1. **Observation of the Relationship:** To establish the concurrency of the lines, we shall use projective geometry concepts. Due to the nature of the incircles touching each other pairwise, the points ( A_1, B_1, C_1 ) etc., are tangency points that significantly simplify the geometry into special configurations. 2. **Projective Transformation Analysis:** Consider mapping the vertices of ( triangle ABC ) via a projective transformation where ( D ) is considered the origin: - Let ( DA ) be the x-axis. - Let ( DB ) be the y-axis. - Let ( DC ) be the z-axis. Under such a transformation, the problem of the incircles can be reframed with these axes for simplicity in analysis. 3. **Parabola and Circle Involvements:** Since the incircles touch each other along common tangents, they form parabolic-like structures in this coordinate transformed view. Using projective properties, the x and y axes transform into the tangents of circles, showing properties of tangency points. - For instance, in the ( xy )-plane, the inscribed circle's tangency involves a tangent ellipse (or parabola); analyzed similarly for other planes. 4. **Intersection Points and Symmetry:** Let’s determine the precise transformed coordinates for intersections: - For ( B_1C_2 ) and ( B_2C_1 ), trace their extended lines in new axes. These lines intersect due to tangency radius symmetry, yielding point ( E ). - Similarly, for ( A_1C_2 ) and ( A_2C_1 ), yielding point ( F ). 5. **Concurrency through Coordinate Alignment:** Upon these transformations, the crucial point of analysis is the geometry’s symmetry that guarantees: - ( E ) lies on a line parallel to the x-axis. - ( F ) lies on a line parallel to the y-axis. - Combining these with the properties of intersection lines, it is noted that each transformation conserves respective relationships between these points at the origin. 6. **Conclusion on Intersection Point:** Hence, geometrically and projectively, the intersection of: - ( B_1C_2 ) and ( B_2C_1 ) (finding ( E )) - ( A_1C_2 ) and ( A_2C_1 ) (finding ( F )) - Respectful tangency lines ensuring all intersect at a singular point with concurrent lines being invariant under projective mappings.

For ( |x| > 2 ), it clearly holds that ( p_n(x) > x ). Therefore, we restrict our discussion to the domain ( [-2, 2] ). 4. We make use of the substitution ( x = 2 cos t ) where ( t in [0, pi] ). 5.

This is a straightforward application of the definition, making the statement correct. 4. **Statement ④**: The only number that is equal to its opposite is 0, since 0 is neither positive nor negative, and -0 = 0. This statement is correct because it acknowledges the special case of 0. 5. **Statement ⑤**: While positive and negative numbers are on opposite sides of the number line, not all pairs of positive and negative numbers are considered \\"opposites\\" in the mathematical sense, which requires them to have the same magnitude. For example, +3 and -1 are not opposites because they do not have the same magnitude. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.

A tree can be constructed where a and b share nodes c, e, g and b shares nodes d, f, h with additional connections between remaining elements. - **Cycle Types 2 + 3 + 3 and 3 + 5 Lead to Cycles:** - Permutation cycle types like 2+3+3 or 3+5 introduce cycles within the vertex connections, violating the tree property.

Let us assume that the desired arrangement of 300 positive numbers on a circle exists. Specifically, we assume that each number except one equals the difference of its neighbors. 2. Suppose ( m ) is the greatest number among these 300 positive numbers. Clearly, ( m ) cannot be equal to the difference of its two neighbors since ( m ) is the greatest and the difference cannot exceed ( m ). Hence, only one number, ( m ), does not equal the difference of its neighbors. 3. Let ( d ) be one of the smallest numbers among these 300 numbers. Consider one of the arcs on the circle between ( d ) and ( m ); let the positions on this arc be these consecutive numbers: ( d = a_0, a_1, ldots, a_k = m ). 4. We need to prove by induction on ( i = 0, 1, ldots, k-1 ) that ( a_{i+1} geq a_i ). - **Base case** (( i = 0 )): The assertion ( a_1 geq a_0 ) is true as ( d ) is the smallest number. - **Inductive step**: Suppose that for some ( i < k ), ( a_{i-1} leq a_i ). We have the equation ( a_i = |a_{i-1} - a_{i+1}| ). Given ( a_{i+1} > 0 ) and assuming the correct induction step, it leads to ( a_{i+1} = a_i + a_{i-1} ). Thus, ( a_{i+1} > a_i ) which completes the inductive step. 5. This implies that ( a_{i+1} geq a_i ) for all ( i ). 6. We have established that these numbers increase monotonously from ( d = a_0 ) to ( m = a_k ) on one arc. Similarly, consider the other arc between ( d ) and ( m ); if these numbers are ( d = b_0, b_1, ldots, b_ell = m ), a similar argument shows ( b_{i+1} geq b_i ) for all ( i ). 7. Since ( a_0 = b_0 = d ), we must also have ( d = |a_1 - b_1| ). Assuming without loss of generality ( d = b_1 - a_1 ), we get ( a_2 = a_1 + a_0 ) and consequently, ( a_i < b_i leq a_{i+1} ) for all ( i ). 8.

Finally, the number ( a_0 = b_0 leq a_1 < b_1 leq a_2 < b_2 leq ldots ). This implies that ( b_ell = a_k ) only when ( k = ell + 1 ), but in such cases, the total number of numbers in the circle would be ( k + ell = 2ell + 1 ), an odd number, which cannot equal 300. 10.

Substitute the partial derivatives into the formula for ( y' ): [ y' = -frac{F_x}{F_y} = -frac{y x^{y-1} - y^x ln y}{x^y ln x - x y^{x-1}} ] 4. Simplify the expression for ( y' ): Since ( x^y = y^x ), we know ( ln (x^y) = ln (y^x) ), hence: [ y ln x = x ln y quad text{or} quad ln x = frac{x ln y}{y} ] With this, we can simplify: [ y' = frac{left( frac{y}{x} - ln y right) y^x}{y^x left( ln x - frac{x}{y} right)} = frac{frac{y}{x} - frac{y}{x} ln x}{frac{x}{y} ln y - frac{x}{y}} = frac{frac{y}{x} - ln y}{ln x - frac{x}{y}} ] Multiplying numerator and denominator by ( y ): [ y' = frac{y^2 (ln x - 1)}{x^2 (ln y - 1)} ] Thus: [ y' = frac{y^2 (ln x - 1)}{x^2 (ln y - 1)} ] 5. To find the second derivative ( y'' ), we differentiate ( y' ) with respect to ( x ): [ y' = frac{y^2 (ln x - 1)}{x^2 (ln y - 1)} ] Differentiating using product and quotient rules: [ y'' = left( frac{ln x - 1}{x^2} right)_x frac{y^2}{ln y - 1} + frac{ln x - 1}{x^2} left( frac{y^2}{ln y - 1} right)_x ] Compute each term: [ left( frac{ln x - 1}{x^2} right)_x = frac{x^2 cdot frac{1}{x} - 2x (ln x - 1)}{x^4 (ln y - 1)} y^2 ] [ frac{(3 - 2 ln x) y^2}{x^3 (ln y - 1)} ] and [ left( frac{y^2}{ln y - 1} right)_x = frac{2 y y' (ln y - 1) - y^2 cdot frac{y'}{y}}{(ln y - 1)^2} ] 6. Combine the results: [ y'' = frac{x(3 - 2 ln x) (ln y - 1)^2 + (ln x - 1)^2 (2 ln y - 3) y}{x^4 (ln y - 1)^3} y^2 ] Thus, the derivatives are: [ boxed{y' = frac{y^2 (ln x - 1)}{x^2 (ln y - 1)}} ] and [ boxed{y'' = frac{x (3 - 2 ln x) (ln y - 1)^2 + (ln x - 1)^2 (2 ln y - 3) y}{x^4 (ln y - 1)^3} y^2} ]"},{"prompt":"parallelogram (ABCD), (angle BAD = 76^circ).

Since Samson is currently 6 years old, it was 6 - 2 = 4 years ago that he was 2 years old. At that time, Samson's mother was 8 years older than him. So, 4 years ago, when Samson was 2, his mother was 2 + 8 = 10 years old. Now, we need to find out how old Samson's mother is now.

However, this doesn't make sense because a mother cannot be 14 years old when her child is 6 years old. There must be a mistake in the interpretation of the problem.

Now let's find out the mother's age at that time: M - 4 = 4(2) M - 4 = 8 M = 8 + 4 M = 12 So, Samson's mother was 12 years old 4 years ago.

By considering the dot product overrightarrow{MQ}cdotoverrightarrow{OQ}=0, we derive the equation: [(x+1)x+(y-1)y=0] This simplifies to: [{(x+frac{1}{2})}^{2}+{(y-frac{1}{2})}^{2}=frac{1}{2}] The distance d from the center of this circle (-frac{1}{2},frac{1}{2}) to the line l: x-y+4=0 is calculated as: [d=frac{|-frac{1}{2}-frac{1}{2}+4|}{sqrt{2}}=frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}] Since this distance is greater than frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, the line l is outside the circle. Therefore, the minimum distance from point Q to the line l is: [frac{|-frac{1}{2}-frac{1}{2}+4|}{sqrt{2}}-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}=sqrt{2}] Hence, the line AB passes through the fixed point (-1,1), and the minimum distance from point Q to the line l is sqrt{2}.

The largest integer ( n ) such that ( n^3 leq 200 ) is 5, because ( 5^3 = 125 ) and ( 6^3 = 216 ). Thus, there are 5 perfect cubes. Now, identify the factorials less than or equal to 200. The factorials (1!, 2!, 3!, ldots) that are less than 200 are: 1, 2, 6, 24, 120 (5!). The factorial 6! = 720 is greater than 200.

(The distance between the rooks is defined as the distance between the centers of the squares they occupy.)","completion":"1. Consider a chessboard with eight rooks placed such that no two rooks attack each other. This implies that no two rooks share the same row or column. 2. Let's examine pairs of rooks placed in neighboring columns. Since each column must contain exactly one rook, we can denote the (i)-th rook's row coordinate in the (j)-th column as (r_{i,j}). 3. Suppose we are considering pairs of rooks from column (j) and (j+1). Let the row coordinates of the rooks in these neighboring columns be (r_{i,j}) and (r_{i,j+1}). 4. The vertical distance between the rooks in columns (j) and (j+1) is ( |r_{i,j} - r_{i,j+1}| ). 5. Since there are exactly 8 columns, there are 7 pairs of neighboring columns to consider (each pair consisting of a column and the column immediately to its right). 6. The possible differences in row coordinates for rooks in neighboring columns can range from 1 to 7 (since there are 8 rows). Due to the Pigeonhole Principle, in these 7 pairings of vertical distances, at least one vertical distance must repeat because we have more pairings than the possible non-distinct values. 7. Therefore, among the pairs of vertical distances, there must be at least one pair that is identical. This ensures that there exist two identical distances among the listed pairs: [ |r_{i_1,j_1} - r_{i_1,j_1+1}| = |r_{i_2,j_2} - r_{i_2,j_2+1}| ] 8. This argument is valid considering rows. A similar argument can be made considering columns if we were to analyze pairs of neighboring rows instead. # Conclusion: Thus, it is proven that among the intermediate distances between any two rooks on the chessboard, there will always be at least two pairs of rooks with identical vertical or horizontal distances between them.

Let (p) and (q) represent the number of nuts in each of the two boxes where (q geq p). - **If (p geq 74):** For (N = 37), Nozdrev necessarily must move at least 37 nuts since no possible immeadiate arrangement sums up to 37 when both boxes have nuts >= 74. - **If (p < 74):** Then, (q > 148). To meet (N = 111) (example where (74 + 37)), Nozdrev either needs to add nuts beyond 37 to the smaller box or subtract exceeding beyond 37 from the larger box. In either case, at least 37 nuts will need to be moved to configure this balance to (N). Thus, for all strategies (N) seizes Nozdrev to move at minimum up to 37 nuts, ensuring he cannot guarantee less. # Conclusion: [ boxed{37 text{ souls}} ]"},{"prompt":"f f(x) = x^2 and g(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1, what is f(g(2))?","completion":"First, compute g(2) using the definition of g: [ g(2) = 2^2 + 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. ] Then, apply f to the result of g(2): [ f(g(2)) = f(9) = 9^2 = 81. ] Thus, the value of f(g(2)) is boxed{81}."},{"prompt":"Compute binom{18}{4}.","completion":"begin{align*} binom{18}{4} &= frac{18!}{4!(18-4)!} &= frac{18!}{4!14!} &= frac{18 times 17 times 16 times 15}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} &= frac{18}{2} times frac{17}{1} times frac{16}{4} times frac{15}{3} &= 9 times 17 times 4 times 5 &= 9 times 17 times 20 &= 3060. end{align*} Conclusion with boxed answer: [ boxed{3060} ]"},{"prompt":"The average of two numbers a and b is 45, and the average of b and c is 90.

(II) Curve C is a circle with center G(0, 1) and radius 1. Let point D on curve C be denoted as D( cos φ, 1 + sin φ) (φ in [0, 2π)). The distance d from point D to line l is given by d = dfrac{|sqrt{3} cos φ + sin φ - 4|}{2} = 2 - sin (φ + dfrac{π}{3}).

The line (l) passes through point (A) and is perpendicular to the (x)-axis. So, the equation of (l) is: [ x = a ] 4. Let (P) be a point on the line (l) with coordinates ((a, y)). 5. Consider the angles: [ angle F_1 P F_2 = theta, quad angle P F_1 A = alpha, quad angle P F_2 A = beta ] Thus, [ theta = beta - alpha ] 6. The distance (PA = |y|). 7.

From his house to the sidewalk: 20 feet 2. Down the sidewalk to the end of the road: 200 feet 3. After making a left, he walks some multiple of his total distance so far (20 + 200 = 220 feet). Let's call this multiple \\"x\\". So he walks 220x feet. 4. Then he walks half the total distance up to this point again to the end of his route. The total distance up to this point is 20 + 200 + 220x feet. Half of this is (20 + 200 + 220x)/2 feet. Now, let's add up all these distances for the one-way trip: 20 (to sidewalk) + 200 (down sidewalk) + 220x (after left turn) + (20 + 200 + 220x)/2 (to end of route) This is the distance for the one-way trip. Since Rich walks the same path back home, we need to double this distance to get the total distance he walked: 2 * (20 + 200 + 220x + (20 + 200 + 220x)/2) = 1980 Now let's simplify and solve for x: 2 * (220 + 220x + (220 + 220x)/2) = 1980 2 * (220 + 220x + 110 + 110x) = 1980 2 * (330 + 330x) = 1980 660 + 660x = 1980 660x = 1980 - 660 660x = 1320 x = 1320 / 660 x = 2 So the multiple x is 2. Now we need to find the ratio of the distance he walked after making a left to his total distance so far. The distance he walked after making a left is 220x, which is 220 * 2 = 440 feet. The total distance so far when he made a left was 220 feet (before multiplying by x).

The difference in age between Declan's elder son and younger son is 10 years. 2. The elder son is currently 40 years old. From the first piece of information, we can express the age of the younger son as the age of the elder son minus 10 years. Therefore, we have: - Age of elder son = 40 years - Age of younger son = Age of elder son - 10 years Substituting the age of the elder son into the equation, we get: - Age of younger son = 40 years - 10 years = 30 years This means the younger son is currently 30 years old. Next, we are asked to find out how old the younger son will be 30 years from now. To find this, we simply add 30 years to the current age of the younger son: - Age of younger son 30 years from now = Current age of younger son + 30 years = 30 years + 30 years = 60 years Therefore, the younger son will be 60 years old 30 years from now.

The cost for Shaquille's initial order in AUD = 18.75 pieces * AUD 1.9/piece = AUD 35.625 Now, let's calculate the cost for their repeated orders with the 15% discount. **Kobe's Repeated Order:** The discount for Kobe's order = 15% of 8.75 = 0.15 * 8.75 = 1.3125 The discounted cost for Kobe's repeated order = 8.75 - 1.3125 = 7.4375 **Pau's Repeated Order:** The discount for Pau's order = 15% of 18.75 = 0.15 * 18.75 = 2.8125 The discounted cost for Pau's repeated order = 18.75 - 2.8125 = 15.9375 **Shaquille's Repeated Order:** The discount for Shaquille's order in AUD = 15% of AUD 35.625 = 0.15 * AUD 35.625 = AUD 5.34375 The discounted cost for Shaquille's repeated order in AUD = AUD 35.625 - AUD 5.34375 = AUD 30.28125 Finally, let's calculate the total amount spent by each person. **Kobe's Total:** Kobe's total = Initial order + Repeated order = 8.75 + 7.4375 = 16.1875 **Pau's Total:** Pau's total = Initial order + Repeated order = 18.75 + 15.9375 = 34.6875 **Shaquille's Total:** Shaquille's total in AUD = Initial order + Repeated order = AUD 35.625 + AUD 30.28125 = AUD 65.90625 Since the question asks for the total amount Pau spent, we only need to provide Pau's total: Pau spent a total of boxed{34.6875} on fried chicken by the end."},{"prompt":"Given in (triangle ABC), (sin A : sin B : sin C = 3 : 5 : 7), then the size of the largest interior angle of this triangle is ________.","completion":"**Analysis** This question examines the sine and cosine theorems.

First, we need to calculate the volume of water displaced when the man gets on the boat. Since the boat sinks by 1 cm (0.01 meters), we can calculate the volume of water displaced as follows: Volume of water displaced (V) = length of boat (L) × breadth of boat (B) × change in depth (h) V = 6 m × 3 m × 0.01 m V = 0.18 m³ The density of water (ρ) is approximately 1000 kg/m³, so the mass of the water displaced (m_water) can be calculated as: m_water = V × ρ m_water = 0.18 m³ × 1000 kg/m³ m_water = 180 kg This mass of water displaced is equal to the combined weight of the man and his supplies. Since we know the weight of the supplies is 15 kg, we can calculate the mass of the man (m_man) as follows: m_man + mass of supplies = m_water m_man + 15 kg = 180 kg m_man = 180 kg - 15 kg m_man = 165 kg Therefore, the mass of the man is 165 kg. Next, to determine the pressure the man exerts on the boat, we need to calculate the area over which his weight is distributed.

Area of the boat's bottom (A) = length of boat (L) × breadth of boat (B) A = 6 m × 3 m A = 18 m² Pressure (P) is defined as force (F) divided by area (A). The force exerted by the man is equal to his weight, which is the product of his mass and the acceleration due to gravity (g ≈ 9.81 m/s²). Force exerted by the man (F_man) = m_man × g F_man = 165 kg × 9.81 m/s² F_man ≈ 1618.65 N Now we can calculate the pressure: P = F_man / A P ≈ 1618.65 N / 18 m² P ≈ 89.925 N/m² Therefore, the pressure exerted by the man on the boat is approximately boxed{89.925} N/m² (Pascals)."},{"prompt":"Given that ( a neq 1 ), ( b neq 1 ), ( a > 0 ), and ( b > 0 ), and the relationship ( log_{a} 2 = log_{frac{a}{2}} 4 = log_{b} 3 ), find the values of ( a ) and ( b ).","completion":"1.

So, we have: [ t = 10 - frac{112.5}{24} ] Now, we can calculate the speed during the first half of the journey using the formula: [ v = frac{text{distance}}{text{time}} ] The distance for the first half is 112.5 km, and the time is ( t ), so: [ v = frac{112.5}{t} ] Substituting ( t ) from the previous equation, we get: [ v = frac{112.5}{10 - frac{112.5}{24}} ] Now, let's calculate the value of ( t ): [ t = 10 - frac{112.5}{24} ] [ t = 10 - 4.6875 ] [ t = 5.3125 text{ hours} ] Now, we can calculate the speed ( v ): [ v = frac{112.5}{5.3125} ] [ v = 21.1764705882 text{ km/hr} ] Therefore, the speed of the person during the first half of the journey is approximately boxed{21.18} km/hr."},{"prompt":"Twelve distinct points are labeled with letters A to L on the circumference of a circle.

Since (overrightarrow {a}- overrightarrow {b}) is perpendicular to overrightarrow {c} and overrightarrow {a} is perpendicular to overrightarrow {b}, we can derive the following system of equations: 1. (overrightarrow {a}- overrightarrow {b}) cdot overrightarrow {c} = 0 2. overrightarrow {a} cdot overrightarrow {b} = 0.

Given that | overrightarrow {a}| = 1 and overrightarrow {a} cdot overrightarrow {b} = 0, overrightarrow {a} is perpendicular to overrightarrow {b}, which implies | overrightarrow {b}| = 1.

We aim to show that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sum ( a + b ) and the least common multiple (LCM) of ( a ) and ( b ) is equal to the GCD of ( a ) and ( b ). 2. First, recall the prime factorization of ( a ) and ( b ): - Let the prime factorization of ( a ) be ( a = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_k^{alpha_k} ). - Let the prime factorization of ( b ) be ( b = p_1^{beta_1} p_2^{beta_2} cdots p_k^{beta_k} ). Here, ( p_i ) are prime numbers and ( alpha_i, beta_i ) are non-negative integers for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). 3. The GCD and LCM are defined in terms of the prime factorizations: - The GCD of ( a ) and ( b ) is: [ gcd(a, b) = p_1^{min(alpha_1, beta_1)} p_2^{min(alpha_2, beta_2)} cdots p_k^{min(alpha_k, beta_k)} ] - The LCM of ( a ) and ( b ) is: [ mathrm{lcm}(a, b) = p_1^{max(alpha_1, beta_1)} p_2^{max(alpha_2, beta_2)} cdots p_k^{max(alpha_k, beta_k)} ] 4.

Notice that ( a + b ) generally has a more complex factorization, but we can make some observations. 5. Let us fix a prime factor ( p ).

Assume without loss of generality that ( alpha leq beta ). 6.

The equality ( FB cdot FG = FB^2 ) holds as triangle ( FGB ) is right-angled at ( B ). 4. **Construction Using the Given Lengths**: - Draw a circle with diameter ( d ) somewhere on the diagram. Use the length ( FB ) (known from earlier steps or data) to draw a tangent segment of the same length ( FB ). - Connecting the free endpoint of this tangent to the center of the circle provides a segment that, when used in conjunction with ( F ) and the known lengths, will divide this tangent segment into parts ( FA ) and ( FD ) such that: [ FA = frac{d}{2} + sqrt{left( frac{d}{2} right)^2 + FB^2} ] - Ensure that ( FA leq 2r ). If ( FA leq 2r ), point ( A ) can be defined. 5. **Final Validity Check and Conclusion**: - The vertex ( A ) could theoretically lie on the \\"lower\\" arc of ( BC ) as well, separated by ( K ). To ensure this, re-attempt the construction by considering ( G ) instead of ( F ). - Repeat the construction steps reflecting this alteration. - Finally, ensure ( FA ) in both cases is less than or equal to ( 2r ). This concludes the construction of the triangle. **Conclusion**: This detailed approach validates the steps involving construction and verification of segments corresponding to the given geometrical conditions to complete the triangle.

If the orthocenter lies outside the segment between the foot and the midpoint of one of the altitudes, then the center of the circumscribed sphere lies outside the tetrahedron.","completion":"1. A tetrahedron with an orthocenter is called an *orthocentric tetrahedron*. In such a tetrahedron, the perpendicular from each vertex to the opposite face intersect at a single point M, known as the orthocenter. 2. The projection of the orthocenter M on any face of the tetrahedron is the orthocenter of that face. Let’s denote this orthocenter by M_i for face i. 3. The center of the circumscribed sphere of the tetrahedron is denoted by O. The projection of O on any face is the center O_i of the circle circumscribing that face. 4. The centroid S of the tetrahedron bisects the line segment MO. 5. The projection of line MO on any face forms the Euler line of that triangle. The projection of the centroid S on the face is the center F_i of the nine-point circle of that face. Let's follow on with more specific details: 1. Consider the orthocentric tetrahedron A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4. We place a plane passing through vertex A_1, the orthocenter M, and the centroid S. This plane is perpendicular to the face A_2 A_3 A_4. 2. The foot of perpendicular from A_1 on the face A_2 A_3 A_4 is the orthocenter M_1 of this face. Within the A_1MS plane, the center O of the circumscribed sphere lies on the line MS such that MS = SO. 3. The projection O_1 of O on the plane A_2A_3A_4 corresponds to the center of the circumscribed circle of triangle A_2A_3A_4. The projection F_1 of S on this plane is the center of the nine-point circle of triangle A_2A_3A_4. 4. By construction, SF_1 = frac{1}{4} A_1M_1. Let I_1 be the midpoint of segment A_1M_1. Then SF_1 = frac{1}{2} I_1M_1. Segment I_1S intersects the line M_1O_1 at a point making M_1O_1 = 2M_1 F_1, thus positioning O_1 as the center of the circumscribed circle of the face A_2A_3A_4, fulfilling I_1S = SO_1. Thus, 1. If the orthocenter M of the tetrahedron lies between the base and the midpoint of any height segment, the circumscribed sphere’s center O also lies within the tetrahedron. Hence, if for each height segment, the orthocenter M lies between the base and the midpoint, O is inside the tetrahedron. 2. If the orthocenter M is exactly at the midpoint of one of the height segments, then the circumscribed sphere's center lies on one face of the tetrahedron. 3. If the orthocenter M lies outside the segment between the base and midpoint for any height, then the center of the circumscribed sphere O will be outside the tetrahedron. Conclusively, we obtain our theorem, proving the relationship between the positions of the orthocenter and the center of the circumscribed sphere in a tetrahedron. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Triangle ABC has AB = 4 , AC = 5 , and BC = 6 .

For the coplanar cases: 1. All 4 points are on the same face of the tetrahedron. There are 4 faces on a tetrahedron, and each face contributes a different combination of 4 coplanar points.

Three points are on the same edge (2 vertices and 1 midpoint), and the fourth point is the midpoint of the opposite edge.

These points lie on the circumcircle of quadrilateral ABCD because they are on the circumcircles of triangles BCD and ACD respectively. - Since BM_A and AM_B are both perpendicular to CD, BM_A' and AM_B' must be perpendicular to CD.

It is evident that the points (K, L,) and (M) are the centers of the cube's faces. 2. **Equality of Tangents**: By the equality of tangents drawn from a point to a sphere: [ AT = AK = AM, quad BT = BK = BL, quad CT = CL = CM ] Therefore, the triangles (ABK) and (ABT), (BCL) and (BCT), (CAM) and (CAT), as well as (AVK) and (AVM), (BVK) and (BVL), (CVL) and (CVM), are pairwise congruent and thus, have equal areas. 3. **Area Summation**: Consequently, the area of the section (ABC) is the sum (S_1) of the areas of triangles (ABK), (BCL), and (CAM) (as the areas of the remaining congruent pairs cancel out in the sum): [ text{Area}(ABC) = S_{ABK} + S_{BCL} + S_{CAM} ] 4. **Cube's Face Analysis**: Let the area of one face of the cube be denoted by (S). We need to show that for any three points (A, B), and (C) on the edges of the cube originating from vertex (V), the following inequality holds: [ S_{ABC} leq frac{1}{2}S ] 5. **Linear Dependence on Distance ( x=VA )**: Consider two of the three points, say (B) and (C), fixed. The areas of (ABK) and (ACM), and thus the entire sum (S_1), depend linearly on the distance (x = VA). Consequently, the point (A) can be moved along the edge such that (S_1) does not decrease. By applying the same reasoning successively for points (B) and (C), it suffices to prove the inequality for points (A, B,) and (C) located at the vertices of the cube. 6. **Cases for Points on Vertices**: There are four such configurations (up to a relabeling of points). In two cases, (S_1 = 0), and in the remaining two configurations, we need to show that the areas sum to: [ S_{ABK} + S_{BCL} + S_{CAM} = frac{1}{2}S ] 7. **Conclusion**: Since the area (S_{ABC}) in all instances is less than or equal to (frac{1}{2}) of the area of a face of the cube, we conclude: [ S_{ABC} leq frac{1}{2}S ] Thus, the area of the triangular section is less than half of the area of a face of the cube. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given two squares and an isosceles triangle arranged as shown in the diagram (vertex K of the larger square lies on the side of the triangle).

Prove that for every integer n the polynomial f(x^n) is irreducible over mathbb Z[x] . *proposed by Mohammadmahdi Yazdi*","completion":"1. Let ( f(x) = x^2 + bx + c ) be a monic polynomial of degree 2 with integer coefficients. Since ( f(x) ) has no real roots, its roots must be complex and conjugate pairs. Let the roots be ( alpha ) and ( bar{alpha} ), where ( alpha = r(costheta + isintheta) ) and ( bar{alpha} = r(costheta - isintheta) ). 2. Given that ( f(0) = c ) is a square-free integer and is not ( 1 ) or ( -1 ), we need to show that ( f(x^n) ) is irreducible over ( mathbb{Z}[x] ) for any integer ( n ). 3. To prove irreducibility, assume for contradiction that ( f(x^n) ) is reducible over ( mathbb{Z}[x] ). Then ( f(x^n) ) can be factored into two non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients. 4. Consider the roots of ( f(x) = 0 ), which are ( alpha ) and ( bar{alpha} ). If ( f(x^n) ) is reducible, then there exist polynomials ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) in ( mathbb{Z}[x] ) such that ( f(x^n) = g(x)h(x) ). 5. The roots of ( f(x^n) = 0 ) are ( alpha^{1/n}, alpha^{2/n}, ldots, alpha^{n/n}, bar{alpha}^{1/n}, bar{alpha}^{2/n}, ldots, bar{alpha}^{n/n} ). These roots must be distributed among the factors ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ). 6. For ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) to have integer coefficients, the roots of ( f(x^n) ) must be algebraic integers. However, if ( alpha = r(costheta + isintheta) ), then ( alpha^m = r^m (cos(mtheta) + isin(mtheta)) ). 7. For ( alpha^m ) to be an integer, ( sin(mtheta) = 0 ) and ( cos(mtheta) = pm 1 ). This implies ( mtheta = kpi ) for some integer ( k ). Thus, ( alpha^m = r^m (pm 1) ). 8. If ( alpha^m ) is an integer, then ( r^m ) must be an integer. Since ( r ) is the modulus of a complex number and ( r costheta neq 0 ), ( r ) must be an integer. 9. However, ( c = -r^2 ) must be a square-free integer and not ( 1 ) or ( -1 ). This leads to a contradiction because ( r^2 ) cannot be square-free unless ( r = pm 1 ), which contradicts the given conditions. 10.

Let's denote the number of colors needed as n. First, each color can represent a distribution center on its own, so we have n choices there. Second, we can form pairs of two different colors. Since the order of colors in a pair does not matter, we are looking at combinations, not permutations. The number of combinations of two colors we can form from n colors is given by the binomial coefficient: C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n - 2)!) Where n! is the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n. We need the sum of single colors and pairs of colors to be at least 12, as we have 12 distribution centers to code. Therefore, we need: n + C(n, 2) ≥ 12 Let's calculate C(n, 2) for different values of n and see when the sum reaches or exceeds 12. For n = 1, C(1, 2) is not possible, so we have only 1 choice (not enough). For n = 2, C(2, 2) = 2! / (2! * (2 - 2)!) = 1, so we have 2 + 1 = 3 choices (not enough).

From this discretionary income, she allocates her funds as follows: - Vacation fund: 30% - Savings: 20% - Eating out and socializing: 35% - Gifts and charitable causes: The remaining amount, which is 102 Now, she wants to allocate 10% of her discretionary income towards fitness and wellness. This means the remaining categories will have to be adjusted to accommodate this new expense. Let's calculate the new percentages for the remaining categories after allocating 10% to fitness and wellness: - Vacation fund: 30% - (30% of 10%) = 30% - 3% = 27% - Savings: 20% - (20% of 10%) = 20% - 2% = 18% - Eating out and socializing: 35% - (35% of 10%) = 35% - 3.5% = 31.5% - Gifts and charitable causes: The remaining amount after the other allocations Now, let's calculate the new amount for gifts and charitable causes: Discretionary income = S/5 Total allocated percentage after new category = 27% + 18% + 31.5% + 10% = 86.5% Remaining percentage for gifts and charitable causes = 100% - 86.5% = 13.5% Since we know the remaining amount for gifts and charitable causes is 102, we can set up the equation: (S/5) * 13.5% = 102 Now, let's solve for S: (S/5) * 0.135 = 102 S/5 = 102 / 0.135 S/5 = 755.56 (approximately) Now, let's find the total net monthly salary S: S = 5 * 755.56 S = 3777.78 (approximately) Jill's new net monthly salary, considering the new expense category and adjusted allocation of the remaining discretionary income, is approximately boxed{3777.78} ."},{"prompt":"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 6.

Thus, we deduce that e must be in the range (frac{sqrt{13}}{3}, sqrt{3}) cup (sqrt{3}, +infty). 4. **Calculating the Slope k_l of Line l**: To find the slope of line l, we use the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines and the fact that the line OD (from the origin to D) has a slope of -frac{b}{c}. Since the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines is -frac{b^2}{a^2}, we find that k_l = -sqrt{e^4 - e^2} by substituting the values and using the relationship between a, b, and c in a hyperbola. 5. **Finalizing the Range of k_l**: Given the range of e^2 as (frac{13}{9}, 3) cup (3, +infty), we substitute these values into our formula for k_l to find that k_l in (-infty, -sqrt{6}) cup (-sqrt{6}, -frac{2sqrt{13}}{9}).

For all real values of m, line l and circle O always have common points, which is equivalent to the point (-2sqrt{3}, 0) being inside or on circle O. Thus, 12 + 0 leq r^2, which gives r geq 2sqrt{3}. Therefore, the range of r is [2sqrt{3}, +infty). 2. Let point A be (-2sqrt{3}, 0). Then |OA| = 2sqrt{3}. When line l is perpendicular to OA, by the perpendicular chord theorem, the length of the chord that line l cuts on circle O is l = 2sqrt{25 - 12} = 2sqrt{13}. When line l passes through the center of the circle, the chord length is the longest, which is the length of the x-axis intercepted by circle O, that is, 2r = 10. Therefore, the range of the length of the chord that line l cuts on circle O is [2sqrt{13}, 10]. 3. We will prove that the circle with diameter P'Q' always passes through a fixed point. For the equation of circle O, let x = pm 1, then P(-1, 0) and Q(1, 0). The equation of line l is x = 3. Let M(s, t) be any point on circle O. Then, the equation of line PM is y = frac{t}{s + 1}(x + 1). Setting x = 3, we obtain P'(3, frac{4t}{s + 1}). Similarly, we have Q'(3, frac{2t}{s - 1}). The coordinates of the center C of the circle with diameter P'Q' are (3, frac{3st - t}{s^2 - 1}), and the radius is |frac{st - 3t}{s^2 - 1}|. Since point M(s, t) is on circle O, we have s^2 + t^2 = 1. Therefore, the coordinates of the center C are (3, frac{1 - 3s}{t}), and the radius is |frac{3 - s}{t}|. The equation of circle C is (x - 3)^2 + (y - frac{1 - 3s}{t})^2 = (frac{3 - s}{t})^2. Since s^2 + t^2 = 1, the equation of circle C can be written as (x - 3)^2 + y^2 - frac{2(1 - 3s)y}{t} - 8 = 0. Setting y = 0, we get (x - 3)^2 = 8, which means circle C passes through two fixed points. The coordinates of these fixed points are (3 pm 2sqrt{2}, 0).

The edges of these triangles are roads and the vertices are intersections. Two cars start from points (A) and (B) located on the same edge (road) and move with the same speed in the same direction. At each intersection, a car can either continue in the same direction or turn (120^circ) either left or right. We need to determine if the two cars can meet. 2. **Movement Analysis**: Since both cars start from points on the same road and move with the same speed, let's denote the distance covered by a car in one move as (d), which is equivalent to the length of a side of the triangle. 3. **Potential Meeting Points**: Cars can only meet at intersections or at coordinated turning paths that lead them to the same intersection at the same time. 4. **Synchronization**: - **Travel Time to Intersections**: As both cars start simultaneously and move at the same speed, if they are to meet, they must reach an intersection at the same time. - **Direction of Movement**: At each intersection, each car can choose to continue straight or turn (120^circ) left or right. For them to meet, they must coordinate these turns to arrive at the same intersection simultaneously. 5. **Geometrical Consideration**: - **Non-reoccuring Paths**: Due to the equilateral triangular grid, any deviation in path (turning (120^circ)) results in the cars creating a triangular lattice pattern relative to each other. 6. **Distance Consideration**: Given that cars start from different points but on the same road, the time required to travel to any subsequent intersection is the same for both cars if moving straight: - If they both move in a straight line, they must meet at an intersection, but since they started together and mid-distance constraints would differ by geometrical segment distance of the road, cars cannot synchronize exactly at the same point unless they change paths. 7. **Coordination Elimination**: - Both cars following exactly the same sequence of changes (left, right, or straight) implies identical paths. Given they started on the same road, this results in always maintaining a fixed offset unless one deviates significantly away managing a triangular lap back. - For any ( 120^circ) turn to have synchronization, the multi-step return must balance algebraically, which can be geometrical invalidated based on lattice difference matrix due to angles formed. 8. **Conclusion Through Geometry Lattices**: - Due to equal speeds, same initial road, and deviation maintaining distance, no feasible coordination at critical points aligns back to the same intersection.

Let's denote: - The length of side (AB) as 1. - The initial position of point (M) as (a) units from point (B) (thus, it is (1-a) units away from point (A)). # Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Initial Position and Step Calculation**: - At the beginning, (M) is (a) distance from (B). 2. **First Step**: - (M) moves parallel to (BC) and reaches (AC). Since (M) is moving parallel to (BC), it intersects (AC) precisely at the point which is the same distance (a) from (C), on side (AC). 3. **Second Step**: - Now, (M) moves parallel to (AB) (which is effectively horizontal if we consider line (AB) as the base), and intersects (BC) at a point again reflecting the distance (a) from (B), but on side (BC). 4. **Third Step**: - Finally, from (BC), (M) moves again parallel to (BC) (which is vertical if (BC) is considered the height), to intersect (AB) again. This new intersection will occur at a distance (1-a) from (B), meaning it ends up at (1-a) distance from (A). 5. **Fourth Step**: - Continue this distance behavior: from (1-a) it will go through the same cycle. It will move parallel to (BC) and then parallel to (AB). By analyzing each segment, we realize the general movement pattern is cyclical, impacting the starting distance in the consecutive steps. # Verification for Returning Position: 6. **Symmetry Point**: - If (a = 1/2) (i.e., (M) divides (AB) into two equal halves), then (1-a = a). Thus, point (M) will return to (1/2) its distance symmetrically after each step in exactly 3 movements. 7. **For Non-middle Point (a neq 1/2)**: - If (a) differs from (1/2), it requires twice the periodic motion, i.e., (6) steps to return to the initial position. Thus, for any (a neq 1/2), point (M) will return to its starting place after 6 steps, 3 steps if (a = 1/2). # Conclusion: The point (M) will indeed eventually return to its starting position on the side of (AB), specifically: - After 3 steps if (M) initially divides (AB) in half ((a = 1/2)). - After 6 steps in all other cases.

If ( p ) is a common prime factor of two elements of ( A ), then ( p ) must be one of the primes less than or equal to 13 (since the smallest prime greater than 13 is 17, and the difference between any two elements in ( A ) is at most 15). Therefore, ( p in {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13} ). 3. We need to find an element in ( A ) that is not divisible by any of the primes in ( {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13} ). 4. Consider the residues of the integers modulo 30. The residues that are coprime to 30 are ( {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29} ). These residues are chosen because 30 is the product of the primes 2, 3, and 5, and these residues are not divisible by any of these primes. 5. In any set of 16 consecutive integers, there will be at least 4 integers whose residues modulo 30 are among ( {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29} ).

The differences between any two of the residues ( {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29} ) are not divisible by 7 or 13. The only differences divisible by 11 are ( 23 - 1 = 22 ) and ( 29 - 7 = 22 ), but these pairs are too far apart to be in the same set of 16 consecutive integers. 8. Therefore, among the 4 residues, there is at most one number divisible by 7, at most one number divisible by 11, and at most one number divisible by 13. This leaves at least one number that is not divisible by any of these primes. 9. Since this number is also coprime to 30, it is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 either.

Let us first consider that (a, b,) and (c) are roots of the cubic equation [x^3 + px + q = 0.] From the symmetry of the roots, we also know that they satisfy the polynomial identity for (x^4): [x^4 = -px^2 - qx.] By substituting (x = a, b, c) into this polynomial identity, we get the individual equalities: [a^4 = -pa^2 - qa,] [b^4 = -pb^2 - qb,] [c^4 = -pc^2 - qc.] Next, we sum these expressions: [a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = -p(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - q(a + b + c).] Given that (a + b + c = 0), the second term simplifies to zero: [a^4 + b^4 + c^4 = -p(a^2 + b^2 + c^2).] Our goal is to evaluate (2a^4 + 2b^4 + 2c^4): [2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) = 2[-p(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)].] We then express (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) in terms of (a, b, c): [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca). ] Since (a + b + c = 0), [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = -2(ab + bc + ca). ] Returning to our previous expression: [ 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) = 2[-p(-2(ab + bc + ca))]. ] [ 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) = 4p(ab + bc + ca). ] From the properties of the cubic roots of the polynomial (x^3 + px + q = 0), we know that [ab + bc + ca = -frac{q}{p}.] Thus, [ 4p(ab + bc + ca) = 4p cdot left(-frac{q}{p}right) = -4q. ] So, [ 2(a^4 + b^4 + c^4) = -4q. ] We recognize (4q) as potentially repackaged in the form that helps confirm the quadratic property. Hence, [ 2a^4 + 2b^4 + 2c^4 = 4p^2. ] Thus, (2a^4 + 2b^4 + 2c^4) is indeed the square of an integer, since (4p^2) is an integer square.

Each inhabitant can be friends with others, and friendship is mutual; thus, friendships form undirected edges between vertices. We aim to prove that there exists an even number of inhabitants (vertices) who have an odd number of friends (edges). 2. **Graph Notation and Definitions** Let’s denote the inhabitants as the set ( mathcal{S} = {s_1, s_2, ldots, s_{101}} ). For any inhabitant ( x in mathcal{S} ), let ( d(x) ) denote the degree of vertex ( x ), that is, the number of friends ( x ) has. 3. **Sum of Degrees** According to the handshaking lemma in graph theory, the sum of all degrees of a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. Formally, we have: [ sum_{x in mathcal{S}} d(x) = 2E ] where ( E ) is the total number of edges (friendships) in the graph. 4. **Partition the Degree Sum** We can partition the sum of degrees into two sums: one over vertices with an even degree and one over vertices with an odd degree: [ sum_{x in mathcal{S}; , d(x) text{ even}} d(x) + sum_{x in mathcal{S}; , d(x) text{ odd}} d(x) = 2E ] 5. **Analyzing the Parity** Notice that ( 2E ) is an even number since it is the sum of twice the number of edges. Let’s denote the sum of degrees of vertices with even degree as ( S_{text{even}} ) and the sum of degrees of vertices with odd degree as ( S_{text{odd}} ): [ S_{text{even}} + S_{text{odd}} = 2E ] Since ( S_{text{even}} ) is a sum of even numbers, it must itself be even. 6. **Implication for Odd Degrees** For ( S_{text{odd}} ) to keep the equality valid as an even number (because ( 2E ) is even), ( S_{text{odd}} ) must also be even. The sum ( S_{text{odd}} ) consists of odd degrees. A sum of odd numbers results in an even number if and only if there is an even count of odd numbers. Hence, ( S_{text{odd}} ) being even implies that there must be an even number of inhabitants (vertices) with an odd degree. # Conclusion Thus, we have shown that in the given village, there exists an even number of inhabitants who have an odd number of friends.

The discriminant Delta for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. Applying this to our function: 1.

For the repaired shoes: The cost to repair is 13.50 and they will last for 1 year, so the average cost per year is 13.50 / 1 year = 13.50 per year. For the new shoes: The cost to purchase new is 32.00 and they will last for 2 years, so the average cost per year is 32.00 / 2 years = 16.00 per year. Now, let's calculate the percentage increase from the cost of repairing the used shoes to the cost of the new shoes per year. The difference in cost per year is 16.00 (new shoes) - 13.50 (repaired shoes) = 2.50. To find the percentage increase, we divide the difference by the original cost (the cost of repairing the used shoes) and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: Percentage increase = (2.50 / 13.50) * 100 = 0.185185... * 100 ≈ 18.52% So, the average cost per year of the new shoes is approximately boxed{18.52%} greater than the cost of repairing the used shoes."},{"prompt":"January, Dream Enterprise produced goods worth 2,000,000 yuan.

There are 4 possible 10-letter words that share these 8 characters, as we can append any combination of dots and dashes in position 9 and 10. For example: - If the fixed part is '........' (eight dots), the words are: '..........', '........--', '........-.', and '.........-'. 4. **Analyze the within-group difference**: Among these 4 words, any two of them can differ in at most 2 positions (the 9th and 10th). This is because they share the first 8 characters. Hence, they cannot all be placed in the same group, because the requirement is that any two words in the same group should differ in at least 3 positions. Thus, each of these 4 words needs to be placed in different groups. 5. **Identify the contradiction**: There are only 2 groups available. Since groups are finite, placing each of the 4 words in different groups is impossible with only 2 groups. Therefore, we cannot satisfy the condition that every pair of words in the same group differs in at least 3 positions. 6. **Conclusion**: We have shown that for any fixed sequence of the first 8 characters, the 4 resulting 10-letter words cannot all be placed in separate groups while satisfying the minimum difference condition within groups. As a result, it is impossible to partition all 1024 words into two groups meeting the requirement. Therefore, the required partitioning of the words does not exist.

In this setup, every two lines from this network intersect at exactly one node. 3. **Calculate the Required Colors for the Example:** Since each node connects with 15 lines (5 to each of the other two nodes), we need to ensure no two lines at a node have the same color. Therefore, 15 distinct colors are necessary. 4. **General Case with Induction:** We'll use mathematical induction to show that 15 colors are always sufficient. - **Base Case:** For a network with ( n = 1 ) node, fewer colors are necessary but even 15 are more than sufficient. - **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that any network with ( n ) nodes can be colored with 15 colors such that no two adjacent lines have the same color. - **Inductive Step:** Consider a network ( S ) with ( n + 1 ) nodes ( A_0, A_1, ldots, A_n ).

(3) If the entrance fee for Jiuzhaigou is 220 yuan per person, calculate the total revenue from Jiuzhaigou entrance tickets during the Golden Week.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Number of Tourists on October 2nd Given that the number of tourists on September 30th is 30,000 people (or 3 in 10,000 people), we calculate the number of tourists on October 2nd as follows: - On October 1st, the number increases by 1.6 (in 10,000 people), so: 3 + 1.6 = 4.6 - On October 2nd, it further increases by 0.8 (in 10,000 people), so: 4.6 + 0.8 = 5.4 Therefore, the number of tourists on October 2nd is boxed{5.4 text{ million people}}. Part 2: Day with Maximum Number of Tourists To find the day with the maximum number of tourists, we calculate the number of tourists for each day: - October 1st: 3 + 1.6 = 4.6 (in 10,000 people) - October 2nd: 4.6 + 0.8 = 5.4 (in 10,000 people) - October 3rd: 5.4 + 0.4 = 5.8 (in 10,000 people) - October 4th: 5.8 - 0.4 = 5.4 (in 10,000 people) - October 5th: 5.4 - 0.8 = 4.6 (in 10,000 people) - October 6th: 4.6 + 0.2 = 4.8 (in 10,000 people) - October 7th: 4.8 - 1.4 = 3.4 (in 10,000 people) The maximum number of tourists is observed on boxed{text{October 3rd}} with 5.8 (in 10,000 people). Part 3: Total Revenue from Entrance Tickets To calculate the total revenue, we sum the number of tourists for each day and multiply by the entrance fee (220 yuan per person): - Total number of tourists (in 10,000 people): 4.6 + 5.4 + 5.8 + 5.4 + 4.6 + 4.8 + 3.4 = 34.0 - Total revenue: 34.0 times 220 = 7480 (in 10,000 yuan) Thus, the total revenue from Jiuzhaigou entrance tickets during the Golden Week is boxed{7480 text{ (in 10,000 yuan)}}."},{"prompt":"John climbs up 3 flights of stairs. Each flight is 10 feet. He then climbs a rope that is half that height. Finally, he climbs a ladder that is 10 feet longer than the rope. How high up did he go?","completion":"John's total climb can be broken down into three parts: the flights of stairs, the rope, and the ladder. 1. For the flights of stairs: - Each flight is 10 feet high, and he climbs 3 flights. - Therefore, the height climbed for the stairs is 3 times 10 = 30 feet. 2. For the rope: - The rope's height is half the total height of the flights of stairs. - Thus, the height climbed on the rope is frac{30}{2} = 15 feet. 3. For the ladder: - The ladder is 10 feet longer than the rope. - Therefore, the height climbed on the ladder is 15 + 10 = 25 feet. Adding all these heights together gives the total height John climbed: 30 + 15 + 25 = 70 text{ feet} So, the total height climbed by John is boxed{70} feet."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between the largest and least numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 while ensuring the numbers are divisible by 3 and do not contain any repeating digits?","completion":"To form the largest and smallest numbers divisible by 3 using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 without repeating any digits, we need to understand the divisibility rule for 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, any arrangement of these digits will result in a number divisible by 3. To form the largest number, we should arrange the digits in descending order: 54321. To form the smallest number, we should arrange the digits in ascending order: 12345. Now, let's find the difference between the largest and smallest numbers: Largest number: 54321 Smallest number: 12345 Difference = Largest number - Smallest number Difference = 54321 - 12345 Difference = 41976 So, the difference between the largest and smallest numbers that can be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which are also divisible by 3, is boxed{41,976} ."},{"prompt":"erman stops at the drivethrough 5 days every week to buy a breakfast combo for himself and 3 members of his team.

We construct the trapezoid ( ABB'A'' ) such that ( AA'' perp AB ) and ( BB' perp AB ), with ( AA'' = BC ) and ( BB' = CA ). 2. **Line Intersection:** According to the problem, the perpendicular bisector of ( A''B' ) intersects the line ( AB ) at the point ( C^* ). 3. **Observation and Initial Conclusion:** We observe that ( C^* ) is the foot of the height from ( C ) in ( triangle ABC ), which means ( C^* ) is the same as ( C_1 ), the foot of the altitude from ( C ) to ( AB ). Due to symmetry and the possible alteration of letters, we can make similar conclusions for points ( A^* ) and ( B^* ). 4. **Result of Observation:** It follows that the perpendiculars at ( C^*, A^*, B^* ) are indeed the altitudes of ( triangle ABC ).

For instance, rotating ( ABB'A'' ) around ( AB ) and ( ACC'A' ) around ( AC ). This rotation places ( AA'' ) and ( AA' ) into planes perpendicular to ( AB ) and ( AC ) passing through ( A ). 3. **Intersection of Planes:** The common perpendicular intersection for both rotations at ( A ) will be the ( AA_1 ) line perpendicular to the plane of ( triangle ABC ). 4. **Results for Points:** Similarly, rotations generate the points ( B_1 ) and ( C_1 ) such that ( B' ) and ( B'' ) meet at ( B_1 ) with ( BB_1 perp text{plane of triangle} ). Analogous results hold for ( C_1 ) and ( A_1 ). 5. **Perpendiculars in Plane:** ( C^* ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( AA'' ), ( A^* ) on the perpendicular bisector of ( BB_1 ), and ( B^* ) on the perpendicular bisector of ( CC_1 ). 6. **Intersection of Perpendiculars:** We show these perpendicular bisectors all intersect in ( S ), ensuring that the three perpendiculars ( a^*, b^*, c^* ) intersect at common line ( t ).

The side length s can be derived from the circle's radius R by considering one of the n isosceles triangles formed by two radii and a side: [ s = 2R sin{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)} ] Given P = 12R, we have: [ n cdot 2R sin{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)} = 12R ] Dividing both sides by 2R (assuming R neq 0), we get: [ n sin{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)} = 6 ] 3. **Area of a Regular Polygon**: The area A of the polygon can be calculated using the formula: [ A = frac{1}{2} n R^2 sin{left(frac{360^circ}{n}right)} ] Substituting sin{left(frac{360^circ}{n}right)} = 2sin{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)}cos{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)}, and using n sin{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)} = 6, we find: [ A = frac{1}{2} n R^2 cdot 2 sin{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)} cos{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)} = n R^2 sin{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)} cos{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)} ] [ A = 6R^2 cos{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)} ] 4. **Finding n**: We need to evaluate n for which 6 cos{left(frac{180^circ}{n}right)} gives a plausible area.

This means that out of every 5 parts of the mixture, 4 parts are milk and 1 part is water. The total volume of the mixture is 45 litres. To find out how much of that is milk and how much is water, we can use the ratio to divide the total volume into parts. Let's call the volume of milk \\"M\\" and the volume of water \\"W\\". According to the ratio, we have: M : W = 4 : 1 Since there are 4 + 1 = 5 parts in total, each part is: 45 litres / 5 parts = 9 litres per part So, the volume of milk is: M = 4 parts * 9 litres/part = 36 litres And the volume of water is: W = 1 part * 9 litres/part = 9 litres Now, 21 litres of water is added to the mixture, so the new volume of water is: W_new = W + 21 litres = 9 litres + 21 litres = 30 litres The volume of milk remains unchanged at 36 litres. The new ratio of milk to water is therefore: M : W_new = 36 litres : 30 litres To simplify this ratio, we can divide both sides by the greatest common divisor of 36 and 30, which is 6: 36 litres / 6 = 6 30 litres / 6 = 5 So the new ratio of milk to water is boxed{6:5} ."},{"prompt":"Two trains of equal length are running on parallel lines in the same direction at 60 km/hr and 40 km/hr.

Since the trains are of equal length and the faster train is overtaking the slower one, we can consider the relative speed between the two trains. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds because they are moving in the same direction. Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 60 km/hr - 40 km/hr Relative speed = 20 km/hr To work with meters and seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s. We know that 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. Relative speed in m/s = (20 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) Relative speed in m/s = 20000 m/hr / 3600 s/hr Relative speed in m/s = 5.56 m/s (approximately) The time it takes for the faster train to completely pass the slower train is 48 seconds. In this time, the faster train covers the length of both trains. Distance covered in 48 seconds = Relative speed * Time Distance covered in 48 seconds = 5.56 m/s * 48 s Distance covered in 48 seconds = 266.88 meters (approximately) Since the distance covered is the combined length of both trains and they are of equal length, we can say: 2L = 266.88 meters L = 266.88 meters / 2 L = 133.44 meters Therefore, the length of each train is approximately boxed{133.44} meters."},{"prompt":"Compute cos 315^circ.","completion":"Let Q be the point on the unit circle that is 315^circ counterclockwise from (1,0).

The derivative of f(x) is f'(x) = frac{d}{dx} (ln x - ax) = frac{1}{x} - a. For f(x) to be monotonically decreasing, we require f'(x) leq 0 on (1, +infty). This implies that frac{1}{x} - a leq 0 quad forall x > 1, which means a must be at least as large as the maximum value of frac{1}{x} on (1, +infty). The maximum occurs when x=1, so we have a geq frac{1}{1}, yielding a geq 1. Next, let's determine the conditions under which g(x) has a minimum value on (1, +infty). The derivative of g(x) is g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(e^{x} - 3ax) = e^x - 3a.

Since e^x is always greater than e for x > 1, the minimum value of a corresponds to the minimum value of frac{e^x}{3}, and therefore a > frac{e}{3}. Combining both conditions, we require that both a geq 1 and a > frac{e}{3} hold true. Since frac{e}{3} is less than 1, the first condition a geq 1 is the more restrictive requirement.

Let's verify this for our function: begin{align*} f(-x) &= frac{2-|-x|}{1+|-x|} &= frac{2-|x|}{1+|x|} &= f(x) end{align*} Since f(x) = f(-x), f(x) is indeed an even function. Therefore, option A is correct. **Step 2: Monotonicity on (0, +infty)** For x > 0, the absolute value |x| simplifies to x, so the function can be rewritten as: begin{align*} f(x) &= frac{2-x}{1+x} &= -1 + frac{3}{1+x} end{align*} The derivative of frac{3}{1+x} with respect to x is negative for all x > 0, indicating that frac{3}{1+x} is monotonically decreasing. Since adding a constant (-1) does not change the direction of monotonicity, f(x) is also monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty). Thus, option B is correct. **Step 3: Determining the range of f(x)** For x geq 0, we've established f(x)= -1 + frac{3}{1+x}. As x increases, frac{3}{1+x} decreases, so f(x) decreases monotonically from 2 when x=0 towards -1 as x approaches infinity. Therefore, for xgeq 0, f(x) in (-1,2]. Given that f(x) is an even function, for x leq 0, we have the same range, f(x) in (-1,2]. This means the overall range of f(x) is (-1,2], making option D correct and option C incorrect. **Conclusion:** The correct answers are options A, B, and D, encapsulated as boxed{ABD}."},{"prompt":"There are 8 students competing for 3 championship titles.

We know that the total journey is 1 (or 100%), so the fraction covered by walking is: 1 - (3/5 + 7/20) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 5 and 20 is 20.

Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank, the second tank has ( frac{48}{2} = 24 ) gallons of water. According to the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish, the second tank can accommodate ( frac{24}{2} = 12 ) two-inch fish because each fish requires 2 gallons of water. Now, the first tank has 48 gallons, and if we follow the same rule, it can accommodate ( frac{48}{x} ) fish that are ( x ) inches long each. Before one fish in the first tank eats another, the first tank would have ( frac{48}{x} ) fish, and the second tank would have 12 fish. After one fish in the first tank eats another, the first tank would have ( frac{48}{x} - 1 ) fish. According to the problem, after one fish is eaten, the first tank has 3 more fish than the second tank.

Solution: 1. **Initial Conditions:** The sum of the numbers in any 2 times 2 subgrid is zero, and the sum of the numbers in any 3 times 3 subgrid is also zero. 2. **Corner Subgrids:** Consider a 3 times 3 subgrid which includes a 2 times 2 subgrid within it.

We start by considering the number of solutions (x, y) to ax + by = n - cz for each z. For a fixed z, the number of solutions (x, y) to ax + by = n - cz is given by: [ f_{z}(n) = leftlfloor frac{n - cz}{gcd(a, b)} rightrfloor + 1. ] Since a, b, c are pairwise coprime, gcd(a, b) = 1. Therefore, [ f_{z}(n) = leftlfloor frac{n - cz}{ab} rightrfloor + 1. ] Summing over all possible values of z, we get: [ f(n) = sum_{z=0}^{leftlfloor frac{n}{c} rightrfloor} left( leftlfloor frac{n - cz}{ab} rightrfloor + 1 right). ] 2. **Approximate f(n):** We approximate the sum by integrating over z: [ f(n) approx int_{0}^{frac{n}{c}} left( frac{n - cz}{ab} + 1 right) dz. ] Evaluating the integral, we get: [ f(n) approx int_{0}^{frac{n}{c}} frac{n - cz}{ab} dz + int_{0}^{frac{n}{c}} 1 dz. ] The first integral evaluates to: [ int_{0}^{frac{n}{c}} frac{n - cz}{ab} dz = frac{n}{ab} int_{0}^{frac{n}{c}} dz - frac{c}{ab} int_{0}^{frac{n}{c}} z dz = frac{n^2}{2abc}. ] The second integral evaluates to: [ int_{0}^{frac{n}{c}} 1 dz = frac{n}{c}. ] Therefore, [ f(n) approx frac{n^2}{2abc} + frac{n}{c}. ] 3. **Determine constants alpha, beta, gamma:** We set: [ alpha = frac{1}{2abc}, quad beta = frac{1}{c}, quad gamma = 0. ] Thus, [ alpha n^2 + beta n + gamma = frac{n^2}{2abc} + frac{n}{c}. ] 4. **Bound the error term:** We need to show that: [ left| f(n) - left( frac{n^2}{2abc} + frac{n}{c} right) right| < frac{1}{12}(a + b + c). ] The error term arises from the difference between the sum and the integral approximation. The error in the sum can be bounded by considering the maximum possible deviation of the floor function and the integral approximation. Since the floor function leftlfloor x rightrfloor deviates from x by at most 1, the total error over leftlfloor frac{n}{c} rightrfloor terms is at most leftlfloor frac{n}{c} rightrfloor. Therefore, the error term is bounded by: [ left| f(n) - left( frac{n^2}{2abc} + frac{n}{c} right) right| leq leftlfloor frac{n}{c} rightrfloor. ] Since a, b, c are positive integers, we have: [ leftlfloor frac{n}{c} rightrfloor < frac{n}{c} + 1. ] For large n, the term frac{n}{c} dominates, and the error term is small compared to frac{1}{12}(a + b + c). Therefore, there exists a constant gamma such that the inequality holds.

We can multiply equation 1 by 10 to make the coefficient of B the same in both equations: 1) 60O + 10B = 5500 Now, subtract equation 1 from equation 2: 2) 140O + 10B = 9750 1) - (60O + 10B = 5500) ---------------------------- 80O = 4250 Now, divide both sides by 80 to find O: O = 4250 / 80 O = 53.125 Since the number of orchestra seats must be an integer, and we know that at least 50 must be sold, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 53. Now, let's find P using equation 3: P = 5O P = 5 * 53 P = 265 Now, let's find B using equation 1: O + B + P = 550 53 + B + 265 = 550 B = 550 - 53 - 265 B = 550 - 318 B = 232 So, 232 balcony tickets were sold.

Show that the first player can always win.","completion":": To show that the first player can always win, we will use the properties of the polyhedron and its edges and faces. Here are the steps for the detailed solution: 1. **Establish Fundamental Properties**: Let ( E ), ( F ), and ( V ) be the number of edges, faces, and vertices of the polyhedron, respectively. Since each vertex has exactly 3 edges, we can establish these relationships: - Each edge is counted twice (once at each end), so ( 2E = 3V ). - From Euler’s formula for polyhedra, we have ( V - E + F = 2 ). 2. **Derive Relationships Between ( E ), ( F ), and ( V )**: - Substitute ( 2E = 3V ) into Euler’s formula: [ V - frac{3V}{2} + F = 2 ] - Simplify to express ( F ) in terms of ( V ): [ V - frac{3V}{2} + F = 2 implies F = frac{V}{2} + 2 ] 3. **Consider Tetrahedron Case**: - If every face of the polyhedron was a triangle (i.e., three edges per face), the polyhedron would be a tetrahedron: [ frac{3V}{2} = 3F implies V = F = 4 ] - But, this contradicts our problem statement that ( F > 4 ). 4. **Conclusion on Face Edges**: - Since ( F > 4 ), there must be at least one face that has more than three edges. 5. **Strategy for the First Player's Moves**: - **First Move**: The first player selects a face ( K ) with at least 4 edges. Such a face must exist as established. - **Second Move**: On the player's next move, they select a face with a common edge with ( K ). Denote this common edge as ( AB ). Select a face ( K' ) with edge ( AB ) such that the face that shares edge ( AB ) (at vertex ( A ) or ( B )) has not been played by the second player. Given that ( K ) has at least 4 edges, it is always possible to make such a selection where ( K' ) and ( K'' ) haven't been selected by the second player. 6. **Winning Strategy**: - After these two moves, the first player has already chosen faces with a common vertex ( A ) or ( B ). - On the third move, the first player will have chosen three faces meeting at the same vertex ( A ) or ( B ). # Conclusion: The first player employs a winning strategy by carefully selecting faces ensuring that after three moves, they will always have three faces meeting at a common vertex.

Case 1: ( angle C = 90^circ ) In this scenario, triangle ( ABC ) is a right triangle with the right angle at ( C ). Here, the orthocenter ( H ) coincides with the vertex ( C ), and the hypotenuse ( AB ) is the diameter of the circumscribed circle, hence ( AB = 2R ). Therefore, we have: [ AH + BH = AC + BC = AB = 2R ] Thus, the inequality ( AH + BH geq 2R ) holds.

Consequently, ( O' ), the symmetric point of ( O ), must lie inside the triangle ( AHB ).

The perfect squares from 10^2 to 99^2 (100 to 9801) each contribute 3 or 4 digits, since 99^2 = 9801 is the largest four-digit square. Let's count the digits: - For the first 9 squares (1^2 to 9^2), we have 9 squares contributing either 1 or 2 digits each. Since 1^2 to 3^2 contribute 1 digit each and 4^2 to 9^2 contribute 2 digits each, we have 3 * 1 + 6 * 2 = 3 + 12 = 15 digits. - For the next 90 squares (10^2 to 99^2), we have 90 squares contributing either 3 or 4 digits each.

Let ( d(P_{i}) ) denote the number of edges incident to ( P_{i} ) in ( G_{n} ). Then, we have |m_{n}| = frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{n} d(P_{i}) .","completion":"To understand the given problem, we need to analyze the properties of the point set ( F_n = {P_i}_{i=1}^n ) and the graph ( G_n ) formed by connecting points at a distance ( d ) with line segments. We let ( d(P_i) ) denote the degree of the point ( P_i ) in the graph ( G_n ). The problem proposes to show that |m_n| = frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{n} d(P_i). Lemma 1: For each ( P_i in F_n ), we have ( d(P_i) leqslant 6 ). **Proof:** If there exists a point ( P_{i_0} in F_n ) such that ( d(P_{i_0}) > 6 ), then with ( P_{i_0} ) as the center, a circle of radius ( d ) must encapsulate at least 7 points of ( F_n ). In this circle, at least two points, say ( P_j ) and ( P_k ), must satisfy ( angle P_j P_{i_0} P_k < 60^circ ). Given ( P_j P_{i_0} = P_k P_{i_0} = d ), we deduce that ( P_j P_k < d ), which contradicts the minimum distance ( d ) between points in ( F_n ). Hence, we conclude ( d(P_i) leq 6 ). Lemma 2: For each ( P_i in varepsilon(Co F_n) ), we have ( d(P_i) leqslant 3 ). **Proof:** Suppose that ( Co F_n ) is the convex hull with ( m ) edges (( 3 leq m leq n )), and ( P_i ) is a vertex of the convex hull. There are points ( P_j, P_k in varepsilon(Co F_n) ) satisfying ( angle P_j P_i P_k < 180^circ ) and encompassing all points of ( F_n ) within this angle. If ( d(P_i) > 3 ), then there exists four points ( P_{i_j} in F_n ) (( j = 1, 2, 3, 4 )) such that ( P_i P_{i_j} = d ) for all ( j ). These four points must lie within ( angle P_j P_i P_k ) which is less than ( 180^circ ), implying that at least two points, say ( P_{i_1} ) and ( P_{i_2} ) satisfy ( angle P_{i_1} P_i P_{i_2} < 60^circ ). As a result, we find ( P_{i_1} P_{i_2} < d ), which contradicts the assumption that the minimal distance between points in ( F_n ) is ( d ). Thus, ( d(P_i) leq 3 ). Lemma 3: If ( Co F_n ) is a convex polygon with ( m < 6 ), then there exists at least one vertex ( P_{i_0} in varepsilon(Co F_n) ) such that ( d(P_{i_0}) leq 2 ). **Proof:** Consider that the convex hull ( Co F_n ) is a convex ( m )-polygon. The sum of the internal angles is ((m-2) times 180^circ). Therefore, there must be at least one internal angle ( alpha leqslant frac{(m-2)}{m} times 180^circ). Because ( m < 6 ), it follows that ( frac{(m-2)}{m} < frac{2}{3} ) implying that ( alpha < 120^circ ). Let the vertex at this angle ( alpha ) be ( P_{i_0} delta alpha = angle P_j P_{i_0} P_k ), hence, angle P_j P_{i_0} P_k < 120^circ. If ( d(P_{i_0}) > 2 ), then it implies three points ( P_{i_1}, P_{i_2}, P_{i_3} ) are within ( angle P_j P_{i_0} P_k ) and ( P_{i_1} P_{i_0} = P_{i_2} P_{i_0} = P_{i_3} P_{i_0} = d ). Thus, there must be two points ( P_{i_1} ) and ( P_{i_2} ) such that ( angle P_{i_1} P_{i_0} P_{i_2} < 60^circ ). This leads to ( P_{i_1} P_{i_2} < d ), causing a contradiction and thus ( d(P_{i_0}) leq 2 ). Lemma 4: If ( Co F_n ) is ( triangle P_i P_j P_k ), then d(P_i) + d(P_j) + d(P_k) leq 6. **Proof:** If each internal angle of ( triangle P_i P_j P_k ) is less than ( 120^circ ), then ( d(P_i) leq 2, d(P_j) leq 2, d(P_k) leq 2 ) yielding ( d(P_i) + d(P_j) + d(P_k) leq 6 ). If the largest angle in ( triangle P_i P_j P_k ) is ( angle P_k geqslant 120^circ ), then the remaining angles are less than ( 60^circ ), and easily infer ( d(P_i) leq 1, d(P_j) leq 1, d(P_k) leq 3 ), yielding d(P_i) + d(P_j) + d(P_k) leq 5. Thus, the inequalities and the proper convexity properties assure the conclusion's correctness, reaffirming ( d(P_i) leqslant 6 ). Conclusion: By summing the degrees over all vertices and applying the lemma judiciously, we validate that the given equation holds. Thus, |m_n| = frac{1}{2} sum_{i=1}^{n} d(P_i).

Therefore, ( H(n) ) has the following two properties: - For any set of ( n ) points in the plane, the number of acute-angled triangles is at most ( H(n) ). - It is possible to arrange ( n ) points such that the number of acute-angled triangles is exactly ( H(n) ). Given ( n ) points in the plane, the total number of triangles formed is ( T(n) = binom{n}{3} ). Hence, the fraction of acute-angled triangles among all triangles is at most ( h(n) = frac{H(n)}{T(n)} ). 2. **Objective:** We need to prove the inequality: [ h(100) leq 0.7 ] First, we will show that ( h(n) ) is a monotonically decreasing function of ( n ). 3. **Monotonicity of ( h(n) ):** Consider ( (n+1) ) points, and let ( K(n+1) ) be the number of acute-angled triangles they define. By the definition, ( H(n+1) ) is the maximum of such ( K(n+1) ) over all sets of ( (n+1) ) points. Now, remove one point at a time from the set of ( (n+1) ) points and denote by ( K_j(n) ) the number of acute-angled triangles among the remaining ( n ) points (after removing the ( j )-th point). Thus, we have: [ S_n = K_1(n) + K_2(n) + ldots + K_{n+1}(n) ] In ( S_n ), each acute-angled triangle originally from the ( (n+1) ) points appears exactly ( (n-2) ) times because a triangle is excluded only when one of its vertices is the removed point. Hence: [ S_n = (n-2) K(n+1) ] Since ( K(n+1) leq H(n+1) ) and ( K_j(n) leq H(n) ), we get: [ S_n leq (n+1) H(n) ] 4. **Combining the Inequalities:** [ (n-2) K(n+1) leq (n+1) H(n) ] Hence: [ K(n+1) leq frac{n+1}{n-2} H(n) ] Since this inequality holds for any specific set of ( (n+1) ) points, it must hold for the maximum value, i.e., ( H(n+1) ): [ H(n+1) leq frac{n+1}{n-2} H(n) ] 5. **Implication on ( h(n) ):** Substituting for ( h(n) ): [ h(n+1) cdot binom{n+1}{3} leq frac{n+1}{n-2} h(n) cdot binom{n}{3} ] Simplifying, we get: [ h(n+1) cdot frac{(n+1)n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} leq frac{n+1}{n-2} h(n) cdot frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} ] Hence: [ h(n+1) leq h(n) ] 6. **Case Analysis to Verify ( h(n) leq 0.7 ):** We now verify ( h(n) leq 0.7 ) for some ( n leq 100 ): - For ( n = 3 ): [ h(3) = 1 quad (text{since all triangles are acute-angled}) ] - For ( n = 4 ), we observe from the convex hull arguments that: [ H(4) < 4, quad text{and in the best scenario,} quad H(4) = 3 quad Rightarrow quad h(4) = frac{3}{4} = 0.75 ] - For ( n = 5 ): [ H(5) leq frac{5}{2} H(4) quad (text{using earlier inequality}) = frac{5}{2}(3) = 7.5 ] Since ( H(5) ) must be an integer: [ H(5) leq 7 quad Rightarrow quad h(5) = frac{H(5)}{binom{5}{3}} = frac{7}{10} = 0.7 ] Thus, since ( h(n) ) is monotonically decreasing: [ h(100) leq h(5) leq 0.7 ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{h(100) leq 0.7} ]"},{"prompt":"Given that ( O ) is the circumcenter of the acuteangled ( triangle ABC ), and the areas of ( triangle BOC ), ( triangle COA ), and ( triangle AOB ) form an arithmetic sequence, find the minimum value of ( tan A + 2 tan C ).","completion":"Given that O is the circumcenter of the acute-angled triangle ABC, and the areas of triangle BOC, triangle COA, triangle AOB form an arithmetic sequence, we are to find the minimum value of tan A + 2 tan C. 1. **Determine the Areas Relation:** The areas of the triangles triangle BOC, triangle COA, triangle AOB are given to be: [ R^2 sin(2B), R^2 sin(2A), R^2 sin(2C) ] Since they form an arithmetic sequence: [ 2R^2 sin(2B) = R^2 sin(2A) + R^2 sin(2C) ] Simplifying by dividing all terms by R^2: [ 2 sin(2B) = sin(2A) + sin(2C) ] 2. **Use the Sum-to-Product Formulas:** By the sum-to-product identities: [ sin(2A) + sin(2C) = 2 sinleft(frac{2A + 2C}{2}right) cosleft(frac{2A - 2C}{2}right) = 2 sin(A+C) cos(A-C) ] Thus, we have: [ 2 sin(2B) = 2 sin(A + C) cos(A - C) ] Dividing both sides by 2: [ sin(2B) = sin(A + C) cos(A - C) ] 3. **Utilize the Property of Acute-Angled Triangle:** Since A+B+C = 180^circ, and ABC is an acute-angled triangle: [ sin(A+C) = sin(B) ] Therefore: [ sin(2B) = sin(B) cos(A-C) ] Dividing both sides by sin(B) results in: [ 2 cos(B) = cos(A - C) ] 4. **Determine a Critical Trigonometric Identity:** From the above, cos(A-C) = 2 cos(B).

The general condition for a sine function to be decreasing is 2kpi + frac{pi}{2} leq theta leq 2kpi + frac{3pi}{2}, where theta = omega x + frac{pi}{4} and k in mathbb{Z}.

Combining these inequalities and considering omega > 0 leads to -frac{5}{8} < k leq frac{3}{8}. Since k must be an integer, k=0 is the only solution. 5.

Base Case: For ( k = 1 ), we have: [ N_1 = 2 ] The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. According to the rule: - ( 1 ) is considered \\"even\\" (with 0 prime factors) → mapped to 1. - ( 2 ) is ( 2 ) (_one prime factor_) → mapped to -1. Therefore, the corresponding numbers are 1 and -1. Their sum is: [ 1 + (-1) = 0 ] The base case is proven. 3. Inductive Step: Assume that for a certain ( k ), ( N_k ) has an equal number of \\"even\\" and \\"odd\\" divisors, specifically ( 2^{k-1} ) of each. We need to show that ( N_{k+1} ) will also satisfy this condition. 4.

If all six blades of grass were tied into a single ring, it was supposed to mean that the girl would get married within the year. What is the probability that the blades of grass will form a single ring when tied randomly? b) Solve the same question for the case of 2n blades of grass.","completion":"Let's break down the solution step-by-step for parts (a) and (b) of the problem, including detailed references and calculations.

Hence, the total number of ways to pair ends is calculated as: [ 5 cdot 3 cdot 1 = 15 ] Since the top and bottom ends can be paired independently, the total number of ways to pair both ends is: [ 15 cdot 15 = 225 ] 2. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes whereby a single ring is formed:** Suppose the top ends are paired to form specific pairs. For example, let: - The end of the first blade be paired with the end of the second blade, - The end of the third blade be paired with the end of the fourth blade, - The end of the fifth blade be paired with the end of the sixth blade. To form a single ring, the bottom ends must pair in a specific way: - The bottom end of the first blade can be paired with either the bottom of the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth blade, giving 4 ways. - Once paired, let's say the first with the third, we then have the bottom end of the second blade which can pair with either the fifth or sixth blade, giving 2 ways. - Lastly, there is only 1 way to pair the remaining blades.

The problem involves a language of the Mumbo-Yumbo tribe, which has specific rules for the transformation of words. The language only uses two letters, 'A' and 'B'. Two different words represent the same concept if one can be transformed into the other using the following operations: 1. The sequence 'ABA' can be replaced by 'BAB' at any position in the word. 2. Removing two consecutive identical letters (e.g., 'AA' or 'BB') from any place in the word. Given these transformation rules, the first task is to determine if a tribesman can count all the fingers on one hand. Part (a) We need to model the transformations and determine if they allow counting exactly five distinct concepts (fingers). 1. **Simplification with Consecutive Identical Letters:** If a word has identical consecutive letters such as 'AA' or 'BB', they can be removed. This process can be repeated until there are no more such pairs. 2. **Simplification with the Sequence 'ABA' and 'BAB':** If 'ABA' appears, it can be replaced by 'BAB', potentially multiple times, and vice versa. We need to analyze the sequence transformation also. Start by simplifying an example: - Consider a word ( w ) with at least four letters. - If ( w ) contains no double letters, the letters must alternate in pattern 'ABAB' or 'BABA'. Starting with these patterns: - 'ABAB' can be transformed: [ text{'ABAB'} rightarrow text{'ABA'} rightarrow text{'BAB'} rightarrow text{'BA'} ] Similarly, [ text{'BABA'} rightarrow text{'BAB'} rightarrow text{'BA'}. ] As seen, 'BA' and 'AB' appear as stable shorter words. 3. **What combinations can we have:** - Single-letter words: 'A', 'B' - Two-letter words: 'AB', 'BA' - Three-letter words stabilized: 'ABA' and 'BAB' Therefore, we have: [ { text{'A'}, text{'B'}, text{'AB'}, text{'BA'}, text{'ABA'} } ] All potential words (considered as distinct representations) generate less than or equal to 5 words from transformations and reduction. Thus, we determine that counting up to 5 (representing concepts by distinct words) is possible. **Conclusion:** The tribesman can count all the fingers on one hand. [ boxed{text{a) Can count}} ] Part (b) Now, we need to determine if a tribesman can count the days of a week. Applying similar logic as the transformations, counting the days of the week would require 7 distinct concepts. We've seen the logical reductions and transformations: every word can be simplified to specific stabilized shorter words 'A', 'B', 'AB', 'BA', 'ABA'. These transformations cover a combination of 6 unique concepts. But let's be sure if seven distinct concepts can be produced: We try repetitive transformations: 1. Transform words into stabilized forms, reductions happen. 2. Only valid combinations checked till repetition stabilized fails to produce a seventh distinct form. Thus: We'd not get more than 6 unique transformations covering longer forms, barring replications. Thus words representing 7 unique concepts aren't feasibly counted. **Conclusion:** The tribesman cannot count the days of the week.

After rotation, triangle (ADM) will map to triangle (ABL), where (BL) is the extension of (BC). Analyzing the Angles: - After the rotation, angles maintain their relationships by properties of rotation. - Notice: [ angle KAL = angle KAB + angle LAB ] [ angle LAB = angle KAM ] because (AM) bisects (angle KAD). - Consequently: [ angle KAL = angle KAB + angle KAM ] [ angle KAL = angle BAM = angle DMA = angle KLA ] This implies that (AK = KL) since (triangle AKL) is isosceles. Concluding Equalities: - Since (triangle AKL) is isosceles, (AK = KL). - Also, after rotation, observe the equal segments: [ BK = BK quad (text{common segment}) ] [ DM = BL quad (text{from the rotation}) ] - Therefore: [ AK = DM + BK ] Thus, we conclude that: [ AK = DM + BK ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{AK = DM + BK} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the digit in the thousandths place of the decimal equivalent of frac{5}{32}?","completion":"First, note that the denominator of frac{5}{32} is 2^5.

According to the problem, we have the following system: begin{cases} a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 3 a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 4 end{cases} Since we want the volume to increase uniformly from bottom to top, we can assume there is a constant difference d such that a_{i+1} = a_i + d for i = 1, 2, ..., 8. This is the definition of an arithmetic series. We can use the fact that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by S_n = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d). We can solve for a_1 and d using the given sums for sections 1-4 and 7-9: 1. The total volume of the top four sections is given by a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 3. 2. The total volume of the bottom three sections is given by a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 4. Considering the uniform increment from the bottom to the top, a_7 would actually correspond to the first term of an arithmetic series if we invert the order. In an arithmetic progression, the sum of equidistant terms from the beginning and the end of the series is constant; hence, a_1 + a_9 = a_2 + a_8 = a_3 + a_7. Now, we know that the sum of the volumes of the top four sections (assuming it follows the arithmetic progression) is: S_4 = frac{4}{2}(2a_1 + (4-1)d) = 3 This is equivalent to: 2a_1 + 3d = frac{3}{2} We also know that a_3 + a_7 = 2a_4 because a_3 precedes a_4 by d and a_7 follows a_4 by the same difference d. And since a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = 4, we have: a_4 = frac{4}{3} So, a_1 = a_4 - 3d = frac{4}{3} - 3d. Plugging this into our previous equation, we get: 2left(frac{4}{3} - 3dright) + 3d = frac{3}{2} Solving for d, we find: frac{8}{3} - 6d + 3d = frac{3}{2} frac{8}{3} - frac{3}{2} = 3d d = frac{frac{8}{3} - frac{3}{2}}{3} = frac{frac{16 - 9}{6}}{3} = frac{7}{18} Using d = frac{7}{18} to find a_1, we get: a_1 = frac{4}{3} - 3left(frac{7}{18}right) = frac{4}{3} - frac{7}{6} = frac{8 - 7}{6} = frac{1}{6} Now, we calculate the total volume of the middle two sections using the first term and the common difference: a_5 + a_6 = 2a_1 + 8d = 2left(frac{1}{6}right) + 8left(frac{7}{18}right) = frac{2}{6} + frac{56}{18} = frac{1}{3} + frac{28}{9} = frac{3 + 28}{9} = frac{31}{9} Therefore, the combined volume of the two middle sections is boxed{frac{31}{9}} liters."},{"prompt":"There are 13 weights arranged in a row on a table, ordered by mass (the lightest on the left, the heaviest on the right).

Since every word must have an even number of white squares, the smallest possible island must have at least 4 white squares. - Take the leftmost, uppermost white square (s) in the island. There must be a white square immediately to the right and immediately below (s). - If the square completing the (2 times 2) subgrid is black, there must be another white square to the left of the square immediately below (s), which contradicts (s) being the leftmost square. - Therefore, every island must contain a (2 times 2) subgrid of white squares. 4. **Decomposition of Islands:** - Removing a (2 times 2) subgrid of white squares from an island either removes the island or leaves it as a single island. - Changing a (2 times 2) grid of white squares to black squares in a tasty crossword puzzle still results in a tasty crossword puzzle because the words in those rows and columns decrease in length by two, maintaining even lengths. 5. **Maximizing the Number of White Squares:** - The maximum configuration of white squares is achieved by having the most number of disjoint (2 times 2) grids. - The largest possible island is a (14 times 14) grid, which can be decomposed into (49) disjoint (2 times 2) grids, giving (4 times 49 = 196) white squares. 6. **Sum of All Possible Values of (n):** - Since each island can be decomposed into disjoint (2 times 2) grids, the number of white squares (n) must be a multiple of 4. - The possible values of (n) are (4, 8, 12, ldots, 196). 7. **Calculate the Sum:** - The sequence (4, 8, 12, ldots, 196) is an arithmetic series with the first term (a = 4), common difference (d = 4), and the last term (l = 196). - The number of terms (n) in the series is given by: [ n = frac{196 - 4}{4} + 1 = 49 ] - The sum (S) of the first (n) terms of an arithmetic series is given by: [ S = frac{n}{2} (a + l) = frac{49}{2} (4 + 196) = frac{49}{2} times 200 = 49 times 100 = 4900 ] The final answer is (boxed{4900})"},{"prompt":"A school's participants in a math competition had an average score of 75.

We need to determine the total length of the internal borders (mёж). 1. **Identify the possible sizes of the square plots:** Since the garden is (6 times 7 = 42) square meters, we must split this area into 5 integer-square plots. The squares must satisfy the condition that the sum of their areas equals 42: [ 42 = 4^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 ] 2. **Calculate the perimeter of each square plot:** For a square plot of side length (a), the perimeter is (4a). - Plot with side (4) meters: [ text{Perimeter} = 4 times 4 = 16 text{ meters} ] - Two plots with side (3) meters each: [ text{Perimeter} = 2 times (4 times 3) = 2 times 12 = 24 text{ meters} ] - Two plots with side (2) meters each: [ text{Perimeter} = 2 times (4 times 2) = 2 times 8 = 16 text{ meters} ] Therefore, the total \\"sum of perimeters\\" (if considering each square separately) is: [ 16 + 24 + 16 = 56 text{ meters} ] 3. **Adjust for the external boundaries and shared internal boundaries:** The whole garden's perimeter must be subtracted from this sum: [ text{Garden perimeter} = 2 times (6 + 7) = 2 times 13 = 26 text{ meters} ] Thus, this 26 meters is initially included in the total sum of perimeters because these are accounted parts of the garden's edge and not the internal borders.

First, consider the term: [ left(x + frac{1}{y}right)^2. ] Expanding and applying AM-GM to each part, we get: [ left(x + frac{1}{y}right)^2 = x^2 + frac{1}{y^2} + 2 cdot x cdot frac{1}{y}. ] Using the AM-GM inequality: [ x^2 + frac{1}{y^2} geq 2sqrt{x^2 cdot frac{1}{y^2}} = 2 cdot frac{x}{y}. ] Therefore, [ x^2 + 2cdot x cdot frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{y^2} geq 2 cdot frac{x}{y}. ] 3. Now, for the second term: [ left(y + frac{1}{2x}right)^2. ] Similarly expanding, we have: [ left(y + frac{1}{2x}right)^2 = y^2 + frac{1}{4x^2} + 2 cdot y cdot frac{1}{2x} = y^2 + frac{1}{4x^2} + frac{y}{x}. ] Using the AM-GM inequality again, [ y^2 + frac{1}{4x^2} geq 2 cdot sqrt{y^2 cdot frac{1}{4x^2}} = frac{y}{x}. ] As a result, [ y^2 + 2cdot frac{y}{x} + frac{1}{4x^2} geq frac{y}{x}. ] 4.

If A does not win on the first turn, then B must flip on their first turn.

Consider A's probability of winning on subsequent turns after an equal number of failed attempts by both. Let ( p_A ) denote A's probability of winning when A starts the game. Since the probabilities of winning are symmetrical, we can derive: [ p_A = P_1 + (1 - P_1)(1 - P_2)p_A = frac{1}{2} + left(frac{1}{2}cdot frac{1}{2}right)p_A ] 5.

To achieve this, the mirrors must be oriented correctly in relation to the driver’s position. 2. **Position of Driver-Side Mirror:** The mirror on the driver's side (near the driver) is generally positioned almost perpendicular to the axis of the car. This ensures that the driver can get a direct view of the rear. 3. **Position of Passenger-Side Mirror:** The mirror on the passenger side (opposite side of the driver) is typically set at an angle, approximately 45^circ. This angled positioning helps in covering the blind spot that the driver's side mirror cannot cover. 4. **Identifying Mirror Position in the Image:** Observing the image, note the alignment and angles of the rearview mirrors. The mirror on one side is nearly perpendicular to the car axis, and the other mirror is at an angle close to 45^circ. 5. **Conclusion:** Given the alignment of the mirrors in the image where one mirror is perpendicular and the other is angled, it indicates that the driver’s side mirror is the perpendicular one.

Using the original definition and applying the first relation from problem 1008: [ y_{2s+1} = 4x_{2s} + 3y_{2s}. ] Again considering k = r = s: [ x_{k+r} = x_{2s} = 2x_sy_s, ] and thus, [ begin{aligned} y_{2s+1} &= 4x_{2s} + 3y_{2s} &= 4(2x_sy_s) + 3(y_s^2 + 2x_s^2) &= 8x_sy_s + 3y_s^2 + 6x_s^2 &= 8x_sy_s + 4x_s^2 + 3y_s^2 - 1 &= [2(x_s + y_s)]^2 - 1. end{aligned} ] This confirms that y_{2s+1} = [2(x_s + y_s)]^2 - 1, indicating y_{2s+1} is one less than a square of an even number for odd-index terms. 5. **Conclusion:** From the above steps, it follows that y_{2s} = (2x_s)^2 + 1 is one more than a square of an even number for even-index terms, and y_{2s+1} = [2(x_s + y_s)]^2 - 1 is one less than a square of an even number for odd-index terms. Hence, y_k alternates as either one less or one more than the square of an even number. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Let S_i be the set of all integers n such that 50i leq n < 50(i + 1).

The key observation is how squares are spaced and how many sets cover the range up to a certain square. 1. First, observe the distribution of squares: - The difference between consecutive squares (x+1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1 increases as x increases. This means the sets containing squares become sparser as x increases. 2. Identify the range of x for which the sets do not contain perfect squares: - The smallest perfect square is 1^2 = 1 and we consider up to 2000 times 50 = 100000, so up to 316^2 = 99856, because 317^2 = 100489 is out of range. - The perfect squares that fit within our range are from 1^2 to 316^2. 3. Calculate how many sets contain at least one perfect square: - Since perfect squares are more than 50 apart generally after 7^2 = 49 (i.e., 8^2 - 7^2 = 15), we conclude each set from S_{lfloor 49/50 rfloor} to S_{lfloor 99856/50 rfloor} contains at most one square. - Thus, the sets containing perfect squares range from approximately S_1 to S_{1997}. 4. Total sets that do not contain a perfect square are then: - From S_0 to S_{1999}, excluding those from S_1 to S_{1997}. - That counts S_0 and S_{1998} to S_{1999}, totaling 1 + 2 = 3 sets without a perfect square.

Suppose that the required numbering exists. Consider a part of the chessboard, say a 3 times 3 part overlapping regions, as in Figure 2. By the problem's condition, the sums of the numbers in each of these special parts must be the same modulo 4. 2. Define a generic part as composed of cells labeled p, q, r, s, t. These parts must also maintain the stipulated sums modulo 4. Therefore, we must have: [ begin{aligned} p + q + r + s equiv & k_1 pmod{4} q + r + s + t equiv & k_2 pmod{4} p + q + r + t equiv & k_3 pmod{4} p + r + s + t equiv & k_4 pmod{4} end{aligned} ] The equal remainders (k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = k_4) suggest a repetition modulus that must be consistent. This assumption implies every sub-board part must behave uniformly. 3. Examining these constrains: All numbers on black cells of the board, except possibly the two corner squares, must give, modulo 4, similar remainders - this behavior is impossible due to the cyclical, multicultural nature of mod 4 sequence. **Conclusion:** By considering modulo 4 methodology and part consistency: [ 7b. quad text{The numbering required does not exist.} quad boxed{text{Impossible}}"},{"prompt":"Two fair, eightsided dice are rolled.

After a 10% reduction, the new price of petrol per gallon becomes 0.9P dollars. The motorist can now buy 5 gallons more for 280 at the reduced price. So, the amount of petrol the motorist could buy at the original price for 280 would be 280/P gallons. At the reduced price, the motorist can buy 280/(0.9P) gallons. According to the problem, the difference in the amount of petrol the motorist can buy at the reduced price and the original price is 5 gallons. So we can set up the following equation: 280/(0.9P) - 280/P = 5 Now, let's solve for P: 1. Multiply both sides by 0.9P * P to get rid of the denominators: 0.9P * 280/P - P * 280/(0.9P) = 5 * 0.9P * P 2. Simplify the equation: 280 * 0.9 - 280 = 5 * 0.9 * P 3.

BBB is a three-digit number with all digits being B. The equation given is AB × 6 = BBB.

The only single-digit value for B that satisfies this condition is B = 5, because 105 × 5 = 525, which is a multiple of 60. Now, let's find A: 60A = 105 × 5 60A = 525 Divide both sides by 60 to find A: A = 525 / 60 A = 8.75 However, A must be a single-digit integer, so there seems to be a mistake in our calculation. Let's re-evaluate the possible values for B. We know that B must be a single-digit number, and 105B must be divisible by 60. The only single-digit numbers that, when multiplied by 105, result in a number ending in a 0 (making it divisible by 60) are 0 and 5. However, since A and B are different single-digit numbers, B cannot be 0 (as 0 would not change the value of A). Therefore, B must be 5. Let's try again with B = 5: 60A = 105B 60A = 105 × 5 60A = 525 Now, we divide by 60 to find A: A = 525 / 60 A = 8.75 This is not a valid solution since A must be a single-digit integer. We made an error in our assumption that 105B must be divisible by 60. Instead, we should look for a B such that 105B is a multiple of 60 and also results in a two-digit number where the tens digit is different from B. Let's try B = 1: 60A = 105B 60A = 105 × 1 60A = 105 Now, we divide by 60 to find A: A = 105 / 60 A = 1.75 This is not a valid solution either since A must be a single-digit integer. Let's try B = 2: 60A = 105B 60A = 105 × 2 60A = 210 Now, we divide by 60 to find A: A = 210 / 60 A = 3.5 This is not a valid solution either. Let's continue with B = 3: 60A = 105B 60A = 105 × 3 60A = 315 Now, we divide by 60 to find A: A = 315 / 60 A = 5.25 This is not a valid solution either.

The answer is: [ boxed{text{No}} ] Part (b) 1. **Restate the Problem:** We need to show that any company of 2022 people can be divided into 15 groups such that each person's friends in their own group make up no more than ( frac{1}{15} ) of their total friends. 2. **Graph Theory Formulation:** Visualize the problem as a graph where: - Vertices represent people. - Edges represent friendships. 3. **Vertex Coloring:** Assign each vertex (person) one of 15 colors (groups), ensuring that each color is evenly distributed among the vertices. - This coloring must maximize the number of edges (friendships) that connect vertices of different colors (people in different groups). 4. **Best Coloring Strategy:** - Choose a coloring arrangement that maximizes the number of \\"inter-group\\" edges while minimizing \\"intra-group\\" edges. - Since every person has less than ( frac{1}{15} ) of their total friendships within their group, the remaining ( frac{14}{15} ) must be with people in the other 14 groups. 5. **Proof by Contradiction:** - Assume it’s NOT possible to arrange this way. - For any chosen individual in a group, the contradiction arises because redistributing that vertex among others leads to an increased inter-group edge count which is contrary to the initial assumption that we had maximized the inter-group edges.

Let's break this down step by step. Step 1: Understanding the Grid and Dominoes - A 2n times 2n grid has 4n^2 cells. - A domino covers 2 cells. # Total Number of Dominoes: [ frac{4n^2}{2} = 2n^2 ] Step 2: Condition for Unique Domino Partition - We want the partition into dominoes to be unique such that each domino contains at most one marked cell. Step 3: Small Example Check One way to start is by looking at smaller values of n and gradually increasing: Case: ( n = 1 ) - For a (2 times 2) grid, there can be 2 possible partitions (one vertical, one horizontal). Let's mark one cell. We'll look at marking a specific cell and how the domino placements can be made: 1. Marking (1,1): - The only arrangement is (1,1) with (1,2) and (2,1) with (2,2). In each case above, marking any cell leads to only one unique way to partition the grid into dominoes. From this, it can be concluded that for ( n = 1 ), k = 1 is feasible. Step 4: Generalizing for Higher ( n ) For higher (n), this idea will generalize. Each (2n times 2n) square can be uniquely partitioned by marking one cell in an appropriate manner such that extending this results in an arrangement where each domino contains at most one marked cell. Let's analyze the dependency when the grid size increases from smaller grids: - ( n = 2 ): - Now, a (4 times 4) grid, marking one cell appropriately still divides the grid as necessary. This means that each quadrant would be similar but scaled, hence marking one cell uniquely bisects the grid's arrangement into domino formations. Conclusion: Upon careful consideration and analysis, we conclude that the smallest k required to make sure there exists a unique partition into dominoes in a 2n times 2n grid is: [ boxed{1} ] This result emerges as marking one cell starts an extensible unique pattern in any domino partition in any size of grid (2n times 2n)."},{"prompt":"A company donates 935 pencils to a school.

Numbers divisible by 5 end in 0 or 5. By listing, we find the sequence (5, 10, 15, ldots, 100). 4. To count these numbers, we can use the following logic: - We consider the sequence starting from 5 up to 100. - Each number in the sequence can be written in the form (5k), where ( k ) is an integer. - The minimum value of ( k ) is 1 (i.e., ( 5 times 1 = 5 )). - The maximum value of ( k ) is 20 (i.e., ( 5 times 20 = 100 )). - Therefore, there are exactly ( 20 ) numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by 5. 5.

Since these centers form a right triangle (as they are adjacent in a grid), the sides of triangle{DEF} are 2 (horizontal or vertical distance) and 2sqrt{2} (diagonal distance across one square). 5. **Calculating the Area of triangle{DEF}**: The area of a right triangle is given by ½ times the product of the lengths of its two perpendicular sides: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times 2 times 2 = 2 ] Conclusion: The area of triangle{DEF} is 2.

The radius of the larger circle, which includes the path, is the radius of the grass lawn plus the width of the path. So, the radius of the larger circle is 35 meters + 7 meters = 42 meters. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle. First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle: A_large = π * (42 meters)^2 A_large = π * 1764 square meters A_large = 1764π square meters Now, let's calculate the area of the smaller circle (the grass lawn): A_small = π * (35 meters)^2 A_small = π * 1225 square meters A_small = 1225π square meters To find the area of the path, we subtract the area of the smaller circle from the area of the larger circle: Area of path = A_large - A_small Area of path = 1764π square meters - 1225π square meters Area of path = (1764 - 1225)π square meters Area of path = 539π square meters So, the area of the path is 539π square meters.

Let (M, N, K,) and (L) be the midpoints of arcs (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA), respectively. 2. **Properties of Midpoints of Arcs:** Since (M, N, K,) and (L) are midpoints of arcs, they divide each of these arcs into two equal parts. Hence, the arcs (AM = MB, BN = NC, CK = KD, DL = LA) are all equal. 3. **Constructing the Chords (MK) and (NL):** Draw the chords (MK) and (NL) and let them intersect at point (Q). 4. **Examining the Angles Formed by Intersection:** We are interested in angles (MQN) and (MQL). According to the properties of angles formed by intersecting chords in a circle, each angle between two intersecting chords is half the sum of the measures of the opposite arcs. 5. **Calculating the Angles:** For angle (MQN): [ angle MQN = frac{1}{2} ( text{measure of arc } MK + text{measure of arc } NL ) ] Since (M) and (K) are the midpoints of arcs (AB) and (CD), respectively, the arc (MK) spans half of the circle.

Combining these cases, we have 1 route for when B is visited first and 3 routes for when D is visited first, totaling 1 + 3 = 4 routes.

Therefore, there can be at most n cdot binom{2n}{2} such pairs. 3. **Counting pairs:** - The number of edges in K_{2n} is binom{2n}{2} = frac{2n(2n-1)}{2} = n(2n-1). - Since each color can be used for each edge exactly once, the total number of such pairs is n cdot n(2n-1) = n^2(2n-1). 4. **Column requirement:** - Each column must contain at least n such pairs (since there are 2n rows and each color can appear at most once in each column). - Therefore, if there are more than k = n(2n-1) columns, the property must hold. 5. **Construction for k = n(2n-1):** - For k = n(2n-1), we can construct a coloring without the property. - Start with a 1-factor of K_{2n} having edges (1,2), (3,4), ldots, (2n-1,2n). Assign color i to edge (2i-1,2i) for i = 1, 2, ldots, n. This forms the first column. - Change the labels 1, ldots, 2n-1 cyclically modulo 2n-1 but leave 2n unchanged. This yields 2n-2 other disjoint (multicolored) 1-factors, each forming another column. - Take n instances of the whole matrix of these 2n-1 columns such that in each one the n colors are cyclically permuted with respect to the first instance. - This results in a board of n(2n-1) columns without a monochromatic rectangle. 6. **Conclusion:** - The smallest k such that any coloring of the 2n times k chessboard with n colors guarantees the existence of two rows and two columns where the four intersection cells have the same color is k = n(2n-1) + 1.

We need to prove that ( x+y+z ) is also a root of unity if and only if ( x+y=0 ), ( y+z=0 ), or ( z+x=0 ). 4. First, let's explore the geometric interpretation of roots of unity. Roots of unity lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, equally spaced around the circle. Each root of unity can be represented as a point on this circle. 5. Suppose ( x+y+z ) is a root of unity. Then ( x+y+z ) lies on the unit circle. Visualize the vectors ( x, y, z ), and ( -x-y-z ) in the complex plane. 6. Consider the quadrilateral formed by these vectors ( x, y, z, -x-y-z ). If they all lie on the unit circle and are roots of unity, then the side lengths of this quadrilateral must be equal, and each side length is 1. 7. If the quadrilateral is degenerate (i.e., collapses into a line segment), then two of the vectors must sum to zero. Hence, if the quadrilateral is degenerate, we have: - ( x+y=0 ) - or ( y+z=0 ) - or ( z+x=0 ) This directly satisfies one of the conditions we need to prove. 8. If the quadrilateral is not degenerate, it forms a rhombus. By the properties of a rhombus, opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. Therefore, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. 9. Let the diagonals of the rhombus be denoted as ( d_1 ) and ( d_2 ). The fact that the diagonals bisect at right angles implies that diagonals are orthogonal complex numbers: [ d_1 cdot d_2 = 0 ] which tells us that the diagonals cut the rhombus in such a way that pairs of roots of unity sum to zero. 10. Therefore, at least one pair of roots of unity sums to zero, so either: - ( x+y=0 ) - or ( y+z=0 ) - or ( z+x=0 ) 11.
