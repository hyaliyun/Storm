This means for any integer k such that 1 leq k leq n, k divides n!. Now we analyze the numbers in the range n! < a < n!+2n: - Any integer a = n! + k for 1 leq k leq n is divisible by k, and hence composite since k divides n! and thus n! + k. - For integers a = n! + k where n < k < 2n, k does not necessarily divide n. However, all such k are greater than n and less than 2n. It's necessary to check for primality individually for each k > n. Since n! + k with 1 leq k leq n are all composite, we focus on k from n+1 to 2n-1. The challenge is to determine if any of these k values, which are added to n!, yield a prime number. It turns out the question largely depends on the individual values of k in the extended range. Generally: - The difficulty of proving primality grows as n increases. - We know that for k leq n, n!+k is composite. Hence, we are interested in the intervals [n+1, 2n-1]. These terms are candidates for primality, but this requires individual checks because whether n!+k is prime is not trivially deduced purely by its form.

Then according to the question, it can be determined that aᵢ=i, i∈N∗ (i=1, 2, …, 1000). Therefore, for any m+n∈A (m, n=1, 2, …, 1000), there is aᵐ+aₙ=m+n∈A. Therefore, set A={1, 2, …, 1000} has property P. Therefore, set A={1, 2, …, 1000}. (II) Proof (by contradiction): Suppose there exists aᵏ∈A, such that aᵏ=2000. Then obviously k≤1000, According to the characteristics of property P, let i=j=1000, Therefore i+j=1000+1000=2000∈A, Then there is aᵢ+aₖ=a₁₀₀₀+a₁₀₀₀=2a₁₀₀₀∈A, but a₁₀₀₀ is the maximum value of the elements in set A, so 2a₁₀₀₀∉A, which is contradictory, and the assumption is not established.

If aᵏ>1000, then there exists a positive integer i such that aᵏ=1000+i∈A, so a₁₀₀₀+aᵢ∈A. Similar to (II), a₁₀₀₀+aᵢ>a₁₀₀₀ cannot belong to set A. Therefore, aᵢ≤1000 (i=1, 2, …, k), and it is known from the question that aᵢ≥i (i=1, 2, …, 1000), So, aᵏ≥k, and there are at most 19 elements in set A that are greater than 2000, so k≥1000-19=981. Next, prove that aᵏ>k cannot be true. Assume aᵏ>k, then there exists a positive integer i such that aᵏ=k+i∈A, obviously i≤19, So there exists a positive integer m such that aₘ=aᵏ+aᵢ<2aᵏ<2000. While 2000>aₘ=aᵢ+aᵏ>aᵏ and k is the largest positive integer such that aᵏ<2000, which is contradictory, so aᵏ>k cannot be true. That is, aᵏ=k is true.

The equation of line (ND) is (y = frac{y - a}{a}x + a). 6. **Step 5**: The diagonal (AC) has the equation (y = x) since it passes through ((0, 0)) and ((a, a)). 7. **Step 6**: To find the intersection points (P) and (Q), solve the equations of (MD) and (ND) with (AC): - For (P): (x = -frac{a}{x}x + a) simplifies to (x = frac{a}{2}), so (P = left(frac{a}{2}, frac{a}{2}right)). - For (Q): (x = frac{y - a}{a}x + a) simplifies to (x = frac{a}{2}), so (Q = left(frac{a}{2}, frac{a}{2}right)). 8. **Step 7**: Since (P) and (Q) both lie on the line (AC) and have the same coordinates, (P = Q). 9. **Step 8**: The midpoint (R) of (MN) is (left(frac{x + a}{2}, frac{y}{2}right)). 10. **Step 9**: Since (P = Q), the distances (RP) and (RQ) are equal because they are both the distance from (R) to the same point (P).

When point K traverses the minor arc of BC, the locus of the midpoints of the sides of triangle KLM is similar to the arc triangle ABC. # 1. The centroid of triangle KLM coincides with the centroid of triangle ABC. 1. We first note that in a regular triangle, the centroids of any inscribed equilateral sub-triangles are also identical due to the symmetry and equal division. 2. Consider taking points K, L, and M on the arcs BC, CA, and AB respectively, such that triangle KLM is equilateral, which is possible due to the symmetrical division by 120-degree rotations about the centroid O. 3. As a result, the centroids of triangles ABC and KLM must coincide because each 120-degree rotation maps each set of arcs onto one another, and thus the centroid O of triangle ABC maps onto the centroid of triangle KLM. We can denote this formally as: [ triangle ABC substack{120^{circ} longrightarrow} triangle A'B'C' quad implies quad O_{ABC} = O_{A'B'C'} = O_{KLM} ] # 2.

Note that since KLM is an equilateral triangle and the points K, L, and M are on the circle circumferences internally dividing each side into equal arcs, we find the angle angle KCB and angle ACL sum to 30^circ. 3. By the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, angles subtending equal arcs add up to 30^circ. Thus, [ angle KCL = angle KCB + angle ACL = 30^circ + 60^circ = 90^circ ] Hence, point C lies on the circle with diameter KL, confirming that angle KCL = 90^circ. # 3. When point K traverses the minor arc of BC, the locus of the midpoints of the sides of triangle KLM is similar to the arc triangle ABC. 1. Establish points M^*, K^*, and L^* as midpoints of KL, LM, and MK respectively. 2. Due to the symmetry of the regular triangle and the similar position of the constructed regular sub-triangle by rotation, the locus of these midpoints trace out a similar geometric path like A, B, and C on their respective arcs. 3. Therefore, the midpoints M^*, K^*, and L^* form a triangle similar to triangle ABC.

Let ( X ) be the point on ( AB ) where the rabbit is located after some time. 4. **Fox's Movement**: - The fox ( F ) should move towards point ( X ) such that it minimizes the ratio ( frac{FX}{RX} ).

The sign of a function's derivative determines its monotonicity: if the derivative is greater than 0, the function is monotonically increasing; if the derivative is less than 0, the function is monotonically decreasing. This is a moderately difficult problem. Let's introduce an auxiliary function F(x)=frac{f(x)}{x} and G(x)=frac{2f(x)}{x^2} (x > 0). We will find their derivatives and judge the monotonicity of F(x) and G(x) based on the relationship between the derivative's sign and the function's monotonicity.

This perpendicular bisector, denoted as a_1, represents the locus of points equidistant from A_{1} and O. - Let P be on the same side of a_1 as O. If M is the point where A_{1}P intersects a_1, we note that: [ A_{1}M = OM ] - By triangle inequality in triangle OMP: [ OM + MP > OP ] - Substituting OM = A_{1}M: [ A_{1}M + MP > OP ] - Therefore: [ A_{1}P > OP ] 2. **Conditions for A_{2}P, B_{1}P, B_{2}P:** - Similar arguments can be made for the other endpoints of diameters. For A_{2}, B_{1}, and B_{2}, the points P should lie on the same side of their respective perpendicular bisectors a_2, b_1, and b_2 as O. - Thus, the inequalities: [ A_{2}P > OP ] [ B_{1}P > OP ] [ B_{2}P > OP ] - hold if P lies on the same side of each perpendicular bisector a_2, b_1, and b_2 as O. 3. **Intersection of Valid Regions:** - The set of points P that satisfy all four inequalities must lie within the region bounded by a_1, a_2, b_1, and b_2 on the side towards O. - These lines a_1, a_2, b_1, and b_2 are the perpendicular bisectors of A_{1}O, A_{2}O, B_{1}O, and B_{2}O respectively. 4. **Geometric Interpretation:** - The rhombus formed by these intersections will be inside the circle since each boundary condition is based on the circle's diameters. - The points P satisfying the constraints will be those lying inside this rhombus.

The functional equation for (n = 1) becomes: [ f(1) + f(f(1)) + f(f(f(1))) = 3 times 1 = 3 ] Given that (f) maps to (mathbb{N}^*) (natural numbers starting from 1), we have: [ f(1) in {1, 2, 3} ] However, because the values must add up to 3 and considering the injectivity, we conclude: [ f(1) = 1 ] 3. **Induction Hypothesis:** Suppose for a natural number (k geq 1), the function (f(n) = n) holds for all (1 leq n leq k). 4. **Induction Step:** Prove that (f(k+1) = k+1).

To find the minimum value of sqrt{x^2+y^2+2y}, we can rewrite it as sqrt{x^2+(y+1)^2-1}. Thus, we need to find the minimum value of x^2+(y+1)^2. x^2+(y+1)^2 represents the square of the distance from a point on the circle to (0,-1). Since the distance from the center of the circle to (0,-1) is sqrt{9+16}=5, the minimum value of x^2+(y+1)^2 is (5-1)^2=16. Therefore, the minimum value of sqrt{x^2+y^2+2y} is sqrt{15}.

Let's substitute (x = 1) into the equation to verify: [ 1969(1)^2 - 1974(1) + 5 = 1969 - 1974 + 5 = 0 ] Thus, (x = 1) is indeed a root. 2. **Use Vieta's formulas:** The given quadratic equation is of the form (ax^2 + bx + c = 0). According to Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots is given by: [ x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{c}{a} = frac{5}{1969} ] Since we already know one root (x_1 = 1), let (x_2) be the other root.

Without loss of generality, assume (angle ABC) is acute. 4. **Obtuse Angles:** We claim that (angle BAD) and (angle BCD) are both obtuse. **Proof:** Consider (triangle ABC) and define (A_1) and (A_2) as the feet of the internal and external angle bisectors of (angle BAC), respectively. Similarly, define (C_1) and (C_2) for (angle BCA). By properties of the Apollonius circle, the quadrilaterals (ADA_2A_1) and (CDC_2C_1) are cyclic. This implies: [ angle BAD > angle A_1AA_2 = 90^circ. ] Similarly, [ angle BCD > 90^circ. ] Thus, (angle BAD) and (angle BCD) are both obtuse. 5. **Isodynamic Point and Torricelli Point:** Note that (D) is the isodynamic point in (triangle ABC). Its isogonal conjugate (E) is the Torricelli point, which lies in (angle ABC) but outside the triangle since (ABCD) is convex. 6. **Sum of Angles:** We use the properties of the Torricelli point to find the sum of the acute angles: [ angle ABC + angle ADC = 180^circ + angle ABC - angle DBC - angle DCB. ] Since (angle DBC) and (angle DCB) are parts of the angles around point (D), we can write: [ angle ABC + angle ADC = angle EBC + angle ECB = 180^circ - angle BEC. ] The angle (angle BEC) in the Torricelli configuration is (120^circ), so: [ angle ABC + angle ADC = 180^circ - 120^circ = 60^circ. ] 7. **Conclusion:** Since the obtained sum is less than (90^circ), it follows that (angle ABC) and (angle ADC) are exactly the acute angles of (ABCD). The final answer is (boxed{60^circ})."},{"prompt":"What is the yintercept of the line 2x 3y = 6?","completion":"To find the y-intercept of the line given by the equation 2x - 3y = 6, we need to determine the value of y when x = 0. 1.

We discard x_1 = 0 because the investment cannot be zero. Therefore, the equal investment in projects A and B that results in equal profits one year later is boxed{8} thousand yuan. Part 3: Maximizing the Sum of Profits with Total Investment Given a total of 32 thousand yuan for investment in projects A and B, let n thousand yuan be the investment in project B, and thus (32 - n) thousand yuan is the investment in project A. We aim to maximize the sum of profits, w, from both projects. - The profit from project A with (32 - n) thousand yuan investment is 2(32 - n). - The profit from project B with n thousand yuan investment is -n^2 + 10n. The total profit, w, is the sum of the above: w = 2(32 - n) + (-n^2 + 10n) w = -n^2 + 8n + 64 w = -left(n - 4right)^2 + 80 The function w reaches its maximum value when n = 4, which makes -left(n - 4right)^2 equal to 0 and thus w = 80. Therefore, to maximize the sum of profits one year later, 28 thousand yuan should be invested in project A and 4 thousand yuan in project B, resulting in a maximum total profit of boxed{80} thousand yuan."},{"prompt":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} satisfies: a_3=7, a_5+a_7=26, the sum of the first n terms of {a_n} is S_n.

Thus, we have: a = 178, quad b = 178 Part 2: Calculating the Variance of Team B To calculate the variance of Team B's heights, we use the formula for variance, which is the average of the squared differences from the mean. The mean height for Team B is 178 cm. We then calculate the squared differences from the mean for each height, multiply by the frequency of each height, sum these values, and divide by the total number of heights: [ Var_{Team B} = frac{1}{10} left[ (176-178)^2 times 2 + (177-178)^2 times 2 + (178-178)^2 times 3 + (179-178)^2 + (180-178)^2 times 2 right] ] Simplifying the calculation: [ Var_{Team B} = frac{1}{10} left[ (-2)^2 times 2 + (-1)^2 times 2 + 0^2 times 3 + 1^2 + 2^2 times 2 right] ] [ Var_{Team B} = frac{1}{10} left[ 4 times 2 + 1 times 2 + 0 times 3 + 1 + 4 times 2 right] ] [ Var_{Team B} = frac{1}{10} left[ 8 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 8 right] = frac{19}{10} = 1.9 ] Therefore, the variance of the heights of Team B is 1.9. Part 3: Choosing the Better Team Given that the average, median, and mode of the heights for both Team A and Team B are the same, we look at the variance to determine which team has more uniformly arranged heights. Since Team A has a variance of 0.6, which is smaller than Team B's variance of 1.9, it indicates that the heights of Team A's members are more uniformly distributed. Therefore, it is better to choose **Team A** for the flag bearer role due to the more uniform distribution of heights among its members. Final Answers: - (1) a = 178, b = 178 - (2) Var_{Team B} = 1.9 - (3) Choose Team A because of the lower variance, indicating more uniform heights. Encapsulating the final answers: - (1) a = boxed{178}, b = boxed{178} - (2) Var_{Team B} = boxed{1.9} - (3) Choose boxed{text{Team A}}"},{"prompt":"Let ABC be an acuteangled triangle, and let Gamma be its circumcircle.

Show that for any threeelement subset H of Z, the set Z can be partitioned into subsets congruent to H.","completion":"1. We start by identifying the line with the number line (real line) and the set Z with the set of integers. 2. Hence, it becomes sufficient to show that the set of positive integers can be partitioned into subsets congruent to H. 3. Assume that ( H = {0, a, a+b} ) where ( 0 < a leq b ). 4. Consider subsets of positive integers congruent to ( H ). These subsets can be of the form [ A_{x} = { x, x+a, x+a+b } ] or [ B_{x} = { x, x+b, x+a+b } ] where ( x > 0 ). 5. In the first step, we cover the smallest positive integer (1) with ( A_1 ). 6. In the ( i )-th step (where ( i = 2, 3, ldots )), cover the smallest point ( x ) that has not been covered in the previous steps with ( A_x ) if ( x+a ) has not been covered yet. Otherwise, use ( B_x ) if ( x+b ) has not been covered yet. **Induction Step:** 7. We use induction to show that at least one of the conditions always holds and that the newly used three-element subset is disjoint from all previously used subsets. 8. Suppose, for contradiction, that in the ( i )-th step we cannot proceed because both ( x+a ) and ( x+b ) have already been covered. 9. Since previously used covering sets cannot contain ( x ) and their smallest element must be smaller than ( x ), the covering of ( x+a ) could only be done using ( A_{x-b} ) or ( B_{x+a-b} ) (the latter only if ( a < b )). 10. Similarly, the covering of ( x+b ) could only happen with ( B_{x-a} ). 11. This results in a contradiction because the choice of ( B_{x-a} ) at some step ( j < i ) suggests that ( A_{x-a} ) was not suitable, meaning ( (x-a) + a = x ) had already been covered. 12. Therefore, the ( i )-th step can indeed be executed. The subset ( A_x ) or ( B_x ) used in this step can only intersect previously used subsets in the largest element, ( x+a+b ). If so, its smallest element must also be the same as another subset, meaning both the sets have their smallest element as ( x ), contradicting our premise that ( x ) was not covered before. 13. By induction, we have shown the process works and thus provides an algorithm for partitioning the set of positive integers, and hence the set of points on the line ( Z ), into the desired subsets congruent to ( H ).

This is a classic problem in combinatorial design, specifically involving a type of configuration known as a Steiner system or finite projective plane. 1. Understand the Steiner system ( S(2, 5, 15) ): A Steiner system of type ( S(2, 5, 15) ) is a way of organizing 15 elements (in this case, rose bushes) into groups (or rows) such that any 2 elements are in exactly one group together. 2. Confirm the existence of such a Steiner system: For ( t = 2, k = 5, n = 15 ), it is known that a configuration exists where 15 elements can be arranged into 6 rows with 5 elements each. Each pair of elements occurs in exactly one row. 3. Derive the actual arrangement: - Label the 15 rose bushes with numbers from 1 to 15. - Identify the 6 rows, ensuring every row has 5 distinct numbers and every pair of numbers appears exactly once across all rows. 4. Possible arrangement: There are several possible configurations, but here we show one valid example of such an arrangement: Row 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} Row 2: {1, 6, 7, 8, 9} Row 3: {2, 6, 10, 11, 12} Row 4: {3, 7, 10, 13, 14} Row 5: {4, 8, 11, 13, 15} Row 6: {5, 9, 12, 14, 15} - Each number from 1 to 15 appears in exactly 2 rows. - Each row contains exactly 5 distinct numbers. # Conclusion: This satisfies the requirements: each rose bush (number) occurs in exactly 2 rows, each row contains 5 bushes, and any given pair of bushes is in exactly one of the rows.

So the total wet surface area is the sum of these areas: A = (L * 4) + (2 * L * 1.25) + (2 * 4 * 1.25) We know A = 68.5 m², so we can plug this value into the equation and solve for L: 68.5 = (L * 4) + (2 * L * 1.25) + (2 * 4 * 1.25) First, simplify the equation by multiplying out the terms: 68.5 = 4L + 2.5L + 10 Combine like terms (4L and 2.5L): 68.5 = 6.5L + 10 Subtract 10 from both sides to isolate the terms with L: 68.5 - 10 = 6.5L 58.5 = 6.5L Now, divide both sides by 6.5 to solve for L: L = 58.5 / 6.5 L = 9 Therefore, the length of the cistern is boxed{9} meters."},{"prompt":"Each month, after Jill pays for rent, utilities, food, and other necessary expenses, she has one fifth of her net monthly salary left as discretionary income.

Discretionary income = (1/5) * Net monthly salary Discretionary income = (1/5) * 3300 Discretionary income = 660 Now, let's calculate the amount she puts into her vacation fund, which is 30% of her discretionary income. Vacation fund = 30% of discretionary income Vacation fund = 0.30 * 660 Vacation fund = 198 We know that 35% of her discretionary income is spent on eating out and socializing. Eating out and socializing = 35% of discretionary income Eating out and socializing = 0.35 * 660 Eating out and socializing = 231 We also know that she has 99 left for gifts and charitable causes. Now, let's calculate the total amount spent on vacation fund, eating out, socializing, and gifts/charity. Total spent = Vacation fund + Eating out and socializing + Gifts/charity Total spent = 198 + 231 + 99 Total spent = 528 To find out how much she puts into savings, we subtract the total spent from her discretionary income. Amount put into savings = Discretionary income - Total spent Amount put into savings = 660 - 528 Amount put into savings = 132 Now, to find the percentage of her discretionary income that she puts into savings, we divide the amount put into savings by her discretionary income and multiply by 100.

We can assume that the radius of this excircle is unitary for simplicity. Under this inversion, the sides of the triangle ABC, which are tangent to this circle, transform into circles with the same radius obtained through the inversion. 2. **Transformation Under Inversion:** Notations for the centers of these circles after inversion are O_A, O_B, and O_C. The excircle opposite A will be transformed into a circle k_1 passing through points A', B', C', where A', B', and C' are the inverses of the points A, B, and C, respectively. 3. **Radius of Circles Under Inversion:** We claim that k_1 also has unitary radius since O_A, O_B, and O_C are all unit distance away from F. Consequently, the circle passing through these points must also have a unitary radius. 4. **Midpoints and Radii Relations:** The radii relationship implies that O_A, O_B, O_C are at the same distance, and the circle passing through their midpoints (formed from these points) has a radius of dfrac{1}{2} units. This mixed triangle's vertices are midpoints of FA', FB', and FC' segments. Thus, this mentioned circle with dfrac{1}{2} unit radius and F as center corresponds to circle k_1 when considering two-fold magnification. 5. **Circle Properties:** The image under inversion transforms the circle of radius 2 centered at A' into AB and AC tangent arcs and includes the circumcircle k. Hence, k_1 is the image circle of k through inversion. 6. **Hold Points P', Q':** The points P', Q' are positioned against A', at the opposite points on their circles from A'. Consequently, angle A'FP' and angle A'FQ' are right angles. This symmetry implies F bisects segment P'Q'. 7. **Inversion Center Conclusion:** As F was the center of inversion, importantly, it also bisects segment PQ in the original configuration.

A: 0.99865 B: 0.97725 C: 0.84135 D: 0.65865","completion":"To solve this problem, we first identify the distribution of the number of times the coin lands heads. Let X represent this number. Given that a fair coin is tossed 2500 times, we can model X as a binomial random variable Xsim B(n,p) with n=2500 and p=frac{1}{2}, because each toss of the coin is a Bernoulli trial with two possible outcomes (heads or tails) and the probability of getting heads (p) is frac{1}{2}. The expectation E(X) and the variance D(X) of a binomial distribution are given by: - E(X) = np - D(X) = np(1-p) Substituting the given values: - E(X) = 2500 times frac{1}{2} = 1250 - D(X) = 2500 times frac{1}{2} times (1 - frac{1}{2}) = 625 Since the variance D(X) = 625, the standard deviation sigma is the square root of the variance, sigma = sqrt{625} = 25. According to the De Moivre-Laplace limit theorem, for large n, the binomial distribution B(n,p) can be approximated by a normal distribution N(mu, sigma^2) with the same mean mu = E(X) and variance sigma^2 = D(X). Therefore, X can be approximated by a normal distribution N(1250, 25^2). The problem asks for the probability that the number of heads is at least 1200, which is P(X geq 1200). To find this, we first consider the rule that for a normal distribution, P(mu - 2sigma leq X leq mu + 2sigma) approx 0.9545, which covers approximately 95.45% of the distribution. This corresponds to the interval [1250 - 2 times 25, 1250 + 2 times 25] = [1200, 1300]. Since P(X geq 1200) includes the upper tail beyond 1200, and knowing that the distribution is symmetric around the mean, we can approximate this probability by adding half of the remaining probability (not covered by the 0.9545 interval) to 0.5 (the probability of being less than the mean), which gives us P(X geq 1200) approx frac{0.9545}{2} + 0.5 = 0.97725.

Pour résoudre cela, remarquons que parmi les trois nombres p, p+2, et p+4, il y a nécessairement un nombre divisible par 3 car ils couvrent trois résidus consécutifs modulo 3. En effet, modulo 3, chaque entier est congruent à 0, 1, ou 2. 2. Étant donné que 3 est un nombre premier, si l'un des trois nombres (p, p+2, p+4) est divisible par 3, alors cet entier doit être égal à 3 puisqu'un entier premier supérieur à 3 ne peut être divisible par 3 (sauf 3 lui-même). 3. Si l'un des trois nombres est égal à 3, on teste pour voir si cette valeur de p permet aux trois nombres d'être premiers. 4. Considérons les valeurs possibles de p qui sont congrues à 0, 1, ou 2 modulo 3: - Si p equiv 0 pmod{3}, alors p lui-même doit être égal à 3.

The cost price of one toy is Rs. 1200, so the cost price of 3 toys would be ( 3 times 1200 = Rs. 3600 ). The man gained the cost price of 3 toys, which means the gain is Rs. 3600. The selling price of the toys is Rs. 25200, which includes the cost price of the ( n ) toys plus the gain of Rs. 3600. So, the cost price of the ( n ) toys is ( 25200 - 3600 = Rs. 21600 ).

This implies that the values of y depend on x^2+1. Since the minimum value of x^2 is 0 (when x=0), the minimum value of y in this set is 1 (when x^2=0). Therefore, y takes on all values greater than or equal to 1. This means A can be represented as [1, +infty), which includes all real numbers starting from 1 to infinity.

(Ⅲ) Find the range of f(x) when x in left[0, frac{pi}{12}right].","completion":"(Ⅰ) Since the minimal positive period of the function is pi and the minimum value is -2, we have A = 2 and T = frac{2pi}{omega} = pi, which means omega = 2. Thus, the function f(x) can be written as f(x) = 2sin(2x + varphi). Given that the lowest point on the graph is Mleft(frac{2pi}{3}, -2right), we have 2sinleft(2 times frac{2pi}{3} + varphiright) = -2, which implies sinleft(frac{4pi}{3} + varphiright) = -1. Therefore, frac{4pi}{3} + varphi = frac{3pi}{2} + 2kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}. This leads to varphi = frac{pi}{6} + 2kpi, with k in mathbb{Z}. Since 0 < varphi < frac{pi}{2}, when k = 0, we have varphi = frac{pi}{6}. Therefore, the analytic expression of f(x) is f(x) = 2sinleft(2x + frac{pi}{6}right). (Ⅱ) To find the monotonic intervals, we consider 2kpi + frac{pi}{2} leq 2x + frac{pi}{6} leq 2kpi + frac{3pi}{2}, quad k in mathbb{Z}, which simplifies to kpi + frac{pi}{6} leq x leq kpi + frac{2pi}{3}, quad k in mathbb{Z}. So the function is decreasing on the interval left[kpi + frac{pi}{6}, kpi + frac{2pi}{3}right] for k in mathbb{Z}. Similarly, for the increasing intervals, we have 2kpi - frac{pi}{2} leq 2x + frac{pi}{6} leq 2kpi + frac{pi}{2}, quad k in mathbb{Z}, which simplifies to kpi - frac{pi}{3} leq x leq kpi + frac{pi}{6}, quad k in mathbb{Z}.

The density of water (ρ) is approximately 1000 kg/m³. Mass of water displaced (m) = density of water (ρ) × volume of water displaced (V) m = ρ × V m = 1000 kg/m³ × 0.06 m³ m = 60 kg Therefore, the mass of the man is boxed{60} kg, which is equal to the mass of the water displaced by the boat when the man gets into it."},{"prompt":"f x y = 10 and xy = 9, what is the value of x^2 + y^2?","completion":"1.

He made a total of 79 from selling all his baseball gear. If we subtract the 45 from the total, we get 79 - 45 = 34. This 34 is the amount Grant made from selling his baseball glove after a 20% discount. To find the original price of the glove before the discount, we need to calculate the price before the 20% reduction. If ( G ) is the original price, then after a 20% discount, the glove was sold for ( G - 0.20G = 0.80G ). We know that ( 0.80G = 34 ).

We assume for contradiction that there are no two sides whose length ratio is between ( frac{1}{2} ) and 2. 2. **Formulate Constraints Based on Assumption:** If there are no two sides whose ratio falls between ( frac{1}{2} ) and 2, then: [ mathrm{a}_2 < frac{mathrm{a}_1}{2}, mathrm{a}_3 < frac{mathrm{a}_2}{2} < frac{mathrm{a}_1}{4}, mathrm{a}_4 < frac{mathrm{a}_3}{2} < frac{mathrm{a}_1}{8}, ] and so on, leading to: [ mathrm{a}_n < frac{mathrm{a}_{n-1}}{2} < frac{mathrm{a}_1}{2^{n-1}}. ] 3. **Sum Up the Side Lengths:** From the inequalities obtained, we can sum up all the sides except ( mathrm{a}_1 ): [ mathrm{a}_2 + mathrm{a}_3 + ldots + mathrm{a}_n < frac{mathrm{a}_1}{2} + frac{mathrm{a}_1}{4} + frac{mathrm{a}_1}{8} + ldots + frac{mathrm{a}_1}{2^{n-1}}. ] 4. **Express as a Geometric Series:** The right-hand side of the above inequality is a geometric series where the first term ( a = frac{mathrm{a}_1}{2} ) and the common ratio ( r = frac{1}{2} ). The sum of an infinite geometric series ( S ) is given by: [ S = frac{a}{1 - r} = frac{frac{mathrm{a}_1}{2}}{1 - frac{1}{2}} = frac{frac{mathrm{a}_1}{2}}{frac{1}{2}} = mathrm{a}_1. ] Therefore, for a finite geometric series up to ( n-1 ) terms, the sum is less than: [ frac{mathrm{a}_1}{2} + frac{mathrm{a}_1}{4} + frac{mathrm{a}_1}{8} + ldots + frac{mathrm{a}_1}{2^{n-1}} < mathrm{a}_1. ] 5. **Derive Contradiction:** This implies that: [ mathrm{a}_2 + mathrm{a}_3 + ldots + mathrm{a}_n < mathrm{a}_1. ] However, a fundamental property of polygons states that the length of any side must be less than the sum of the lengths of all other sides (the triangle inequality extended to polygons). Specifically, for ( mathrm{a}_1 ), we should have: [ mathrm{a}_1 < mathrm{a}_2 + mathrm{a}_3 + ldots + mathrm{a}_n. ] Our derivation contradicts this property because we obtained that: [ mathrm{a}_1 > mathrm{a}_2 + mathrm{a}_3 + ldots + mathrm{a}_n. ] 6. **Conclusion:** Given that our assumption leads to a contradiction, the original statement must be true. Therefore, in any polygon, there must exist at least two sides such that their length ratio falls between ( frac{1}{2} ) and 2.

Let’s denote the sum of the numbers in one part by ( m ) and the sum in the other part by ( n ), where ( n ) is divisible by ( m ). It follows that ( m+n ) (the total sum of the digits from 1 to 8) should be divisible by ( m ). 2. The sum of the numbers 1 through 8 is given by: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36 ] Therefore, ( m + n = 36 ). 3. Since ( n ) divides ( m ), ( m ) must be a divisor of 36.

This means ( frac{1}{7}T ) of the homes are termite-ridden and not collapsing. To find the fraction of termite-ridden homes that are collapsing, we need to subtract the fraction of termite-ridden homes that are not collapsing from the total fraction of termite-ridden homes. So, the fraction of termite-ridden homes that are collapsing is: ( frac{1}{3}T - frac{1}{7}T ) To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 21 in this case.

Let's denote this common intercept as c. This property indicates that when the line crosses the x-axis, the coordinates are (c, 0), and when it crosses the y-axis, the coordinates are (0, c). Therefore, when the line is not vertical, it can be expressed in the slope-intercept form as follows: y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the x-intercept is equal to the y-intercept c, we can write: m = -frac{b}{c}. Now the equation becomes: y = -frac{b}{c}x + b. Given that the line passes through point A(2, 1), we substitute x = 2 and y = 1 into the equation to find b. We obtain 1 = -frac{b}{c}(2) + b. Since the x-intercept equals the y-intercept, the equation can be written as: y = -frac{c}{c}x + c = -x + c. Substituting x = 2 and y = 1 again to determine the value of c, we get: 1 = -2 + c, which yields: c = 3. Thus, the equation of the line is: y = -x + 3. When written in standard form, it is: x + y - 3 = 0. Additionally, we also have to consider the case when the line passes through the origin.

Setting ( x = 0 ) in the equation, we obtain: (1+0) + (1+0)^2 + (1+0)^3 + cdots + (1+0)^n = n. Therefore, ( b_0 = n ). 3. Next, set ( x = 1 ) in the equation. This gives us: (1+1) + (1+1)^2 + (1+1)^3 + cdots + (1+1)^n = b_0 + b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n. Simplifying, we have: 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + cdots + 2^n = b_0 + b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n. 4.

The sum of the first ( n ) terms of a geometric series is given by: S_n = a frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}, where ( a = 2 ) and ( r = 2 ).

(1) For z to be an imaginary number, the real part must not be equal to zero. In this case, the real part is 2m^2 - 2, and the imaginary part is (m^2 + 2)i. Since the imaginary part is always non-zero for all real m (because m^2 + 2 is never zero), z is always an imaginary number for any real m. Therefore, for z to be imaginary, it suffices that m in mathbb{R}. (2) For z to be purely imaginary, the real part must be zero, and the imaginary part must be non-zero. Setting the real part equal to zero gives us: [2m^2 - 2 = 0 implies m^2 = 1 implies m = pm 1.] Since the imaginary part m^2 + 2 is non-zero for m = pm 1, z is purely imaginary for m = pm 1.

Differentiate f(x): [f'(x)=frac{d}{dx}(kln x-x^{2}+3x)=frac{k}{x}-2x+3.] 2. Simplify the expression for f'(x): [f'(x)=frac{k}{x}-2x+3=frac{-2{x}^{2}+3x+k}{x}.] Given that f(x) has extreme values on the interval (0,frac{3}{2}), we analyze the function g(x)=-2x^{2}+3x+k which is derived from f'(x) by ignoring the denominator (since x>0 in the given interval, the sign of the derivative is determined by the numerator). 3. The function g(x)=-2x^{2}+3x+k must have zeros with opposite signs within (0,frac{3}{2}). The function opens downwards since the coefficient of x^2 is negative, and its axis of symmetry is at x=frac{3}{4}. 4.

This line divides the triangle such that the areas are in a 1:2 ratio. - For simplicity, consider a line starting from vertex B which divides side b in a 1:2 ratio. Such a line will divide the area similarly. 3. **Construct Necessary Parallels:** - Draw a line parallel to d that passes through vertex B. - If we extend AC to intersect this parallel line, we can formulate another triangle T_3 appended to triangle ABC. - Label the new triangle’s vertex at D. 4. **Relating Areas via Similar Triangles:** - The new triangle ABD is scaled with respect to P and Q. - Note that triangles triangle APQ and triangle ACB are similar because they share congruent angles. - The area ratio of triangle APQ to triangle ACB directly relates to the squares of their corresponding sides. 5. **Determining Length AQ:** - The similarity gives us the ratio: left( frac{AQ}{AB} right)^2 = frac{1}{3} Thus, AQ = frac{AB}{sqrt{3}} 6. **Geometric Construction of AQ:** - This position of AQ can also be constructed by drawing the Thales circle over AB and intersecting it with a perpendicular line at frac{AB}{3}. 7. **Verification and Generality Analysis:** - Determine whether this construction is always feasible by comparing derived lengths with existing sides. - Specifically, AQ = frac{c}{sqrt{3}} < b and AP = frac{b}{sqrt{3}} < c - Analyze whether these inequalities hold under given conditions, noting that issues arise if c > 3a. 8. **Conclusion and Constraints:** - Analyze the triangle inequality to check if these constraints hold generally for c > b > a. - Sum constraints confirm logical infeasibilities, thus, the construction holds under typical conditions. Conclusively, we have verified the necessary conditions and detailed the steps to construct the desired line, proving that it results in the required quadrilateral under the general conditions typically meeting the criteria. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Given the sets M={1,0,1} and N={2,1,0,2}, determine the intersection Mcap N=(quad).

Given S_1 = a_1 = ka_1 - 1, we solve for a_1: [a_1 = frac{1}{k-1}] For S_2 = a_1 + a_1q = 3a_1 = 2ka_1 - 1, we solve for a_1 again: [3a_1 = 2ka_1 - 1] [a_1 = frac{1}{2k-3}] Equating the two expressions for a_1, we get: [frac{1}{k-1} = frac{1}{2k-3}] Solving for k, we find: [k = 2] Substituting k = 2 back into the expression for a_1, we find: [a_1 = 1] Step 3: Determine the general term a_n and find a_{2022}. With q = 2 and a_1 = 1, the general term of the geometric sequence is: [a_n = a_1 cdot q^{n-1} = 2^{n-1}] Therefore, a_{2022} = 2^{2022-1} = 2^{2021}.

We will solve the problem by utilizing both of these concepts. First, let's break down the given definite integral into two separate integrals: int_{0}^{2}(sqrt{4-x^{2}}-x)dx = int_{0}^{2}sqrt{4-x^{2}}dx - int_{0}^{2}xdx Now, let's evaluate each integral separately. For the first integral, int_{0}^{2}sqrt{4-x^{2}}dx, notice that the integrand, sqrt{4-x^{2}}, is the top half of the circle with radius 2 and center at the origin. Consequently, the definite integral represents the area of the semi-circle from x=0 to x=2. Since the radius is 2, the area of the semi-circle is frac{1}{2} cdot pi cdot 2^2 = 2pi. However, we must divide this area by 2 since we're only considering the region between x=0 and x=2, which corresponds to a quarter of the circle. Thus, the first integral evaluates to pi. For the second integral, int_{0}^{2}xdx, we can use the power rule for integration, which gives us frac{1}{2}x^2 as the antiderivative. Now, we evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (2) and subtract the antiderivative at the lower limit (0): frac{1}{2}x^2Bigg|_0^2 = frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - frac{1}{2}(0)^2 = 2.

A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5. Since 0 is not a prime number, the last digit must be 5 for a number to be 5-primable. Thus, we only need to consider numbers ending in 5 that are formed using the digits 2, 3, 5, and 7 (with 5 always being the last digit). We also only consider numbers less than 1000. 1. For numbers of one digit, the only 5-primable number is 5. 2. For two-digit numbers, they must end in 5. The first digit can be 2, 3, or 7. This gives us the numbers: 25, 35, 75. 3.

Since each acre needs 400 gallons, she can spread 4 acres * 400 gallons/acre = 1600 gallons per day. 6. It takes Janet 25 days to fertilize all her fields. 7. Therefore, the total amount of fertilizer spread over 25 days is 25 days * 1600 gallons/day = 40000 gallons. 8. We already calculated that she needs 8000 gallons in total, so the 40000 gallons she spreads over 25 days must be the same as the 8000 gallons needed. This means she must be collecting the fertilizer over time and storing it until she has enough to start spreading. 9. One horse produces 5 gallons of fertilizer per day. 10. To find out how many horses Janet has, we divide the total amount of fertilizer needed by the amount of fertilizer one horse produces per day and then by the number of days it takes to collect enough fertilizer. So, we have 8000 gallons needed / 5 gallons/horse/day = 1600 horse-days of fertilizer needed.

The total number of employees N is the sum of illiterate, primary educated, and college educated employees: N = 20 + P + C The average daily wage of all employees before the wage changes is X. After the wage changes, the average daily wage becomes X - 10. Let's calculate the total daily wages before and after the wage changes: Before the wage changes: Total daily wages = (20 * Rs. 25) + (P * Rs. 40) + (C * Rs. 50) After the wage changes: Total daily wages = (20 * Rs. 10) + (P * Rs. 25) + (C * Rs. 60) The average daily wage is the total daily wages divided by the total number of employees. Since the average daily wage decreases by Rs. 10, we can set up the following equation: [(20 * Rs. 25) + (P * Rs. 40) + (C * Rs. 50)] / N - [(20 * Rs. 10) + (P * Rs. 25) + (C * Rs. 60)] / N = Rs. 10 Simplifying the equation: (500 + 40P + 50C) / N - (200 + 25P + 60C) / N = 10 Multiplying both sides by N to eliminate the denominator: 500 + 40P + 50C - 200 - 25P - 60C = 10N Combining like terms: 15P - 10C = 10N - 300 Now we have an equation with two variables (P and C) and one known value (N).

For q: x > 2, if this condition is true, then squaring both sides of the inequality gives us x^2>4, so q implies p. Therefore, p (that x^2 > 4) is not necessary for q (that x > 2) because x could also be less than -2 and still satisfy p.

According to the problem, when they work together, they can finish 0.25 part of the work in a day. This means their combined work rate is ( 0.25 ) of the work per day.

The complement rule states that the probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the probability of the event happening. Let's denote the event of rolling a 3 as E. The probability of E happening in one roll of the dice is 1/8, since there are 8 sides and only one of them is a 3. Therefore, the probability of E not happening in one roll is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8. If the dice is tossed n times, the probability of E not happening in all n tosses is (7/8)^n. The probability of E happening at least once in n tosses is the complement of the probability of E not happening in all n tosses, which is 1 - (7/8)^n. We are given that the probability of E happening at least once is 0.111328125.

For example, sin x=xfrac{x^{3}}{3!}+frac{x^{5}}{5!}frac{x^{7}}{7!}+⋯, cos x=1frac{x^{2}}{2!}+frac{x^{4}}{4!}frac{x^{6}}{6!}+⋯, where n!=ntimes cdots times 3times 2times 1. These formulas were discovered by the British mathematician Taylor (B. Taylor, 16851731). It can be seen from these formulas that the more terms on the righthand side are used, the more accurate the values of sin x and cos x are calculated.

Also, we need to maximize the product (N cdot d(N)), where (d(N)) represents the number of divisors of (N). 2. **Condition on Factors:** If the difference between any two factors of (N) is divisible by 3, we infer that all prime factors of (N) must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. This is because if (N) had a prime factor (p) congruent to 2 modulo 3, then (p^k) (where (k) is a positive integer) would introduce non-uniform differences, which are not multiples of 3. 3. **Possible Prime Factors:** The smallest primes congruent to 1 modulo 3 are: [ 7, 13, 19, 31, ldots ] \`Next, we need to form numbers using these primes, ensuring we do not exceed three digits (i.e., (N < 1000)) and maximizing the number of divisors. 4. **Testing the Number of Prime Factors:** We aim for the highest number of factors (d(N)) which should ideally be as large as possible. - Check powers of a single prime: (7^4 = 2401 > 1000), so single high powers are invalid. - Check products of two distinct primes: - (7 cdot 13 = 91) (4 factors) - (7 cdot 19 = 133) (4 factors) - (7^2 cdot 13 = 637) (8 factors) (637 = 1000000 / 637 = 1569) - (7 cdot 19 = 931) (6 factors) Thus, (931) has (d(931) = 6) and is a product of distinct primes, 7^2 cdot 19. 5. **Calculation of (N cdot d(N)):** For (N = 931) which has 6 distinct factors, we compute: [ N cdot d(N) = 931 cdot 6 = 5586 ] 6. **Verification and Conclusion:** Since we have verified other possible combinations and ensured (6) divisors maximizes the product (N cdot d(N)), we conclude that the number (931) provides the desired maximum product.

However, since (m) is odd, there would be an odd number of terms, leading to a contradiction because the product cannot be 1 under these conditions. 3. **Detailed Contradiction Proof**: - Consider the prime factorization: For each a_i, let v_i be the sum of the exponents in the prime factorization of a_{i}. If a quotient of two consecutive numbers is a prime number, the exponents' sums have opposite parity. Thus, v_{i} and v_{i+1} must have opposite parity. - Since m is odd, there will be an odd number of v_is. But considering v_{1} and v_{m} (since they are also consecutive due to the circle), they must also have opposite parity. This is a contradiction because in an odd sequence alternating between even and odd, the first and last terms cannot both be different, thereby making it impossible to satisfy the required conditions. # Conclusion In conclusion, for m even, we can find such a sequence, but for m odd, it is impossible.

Petya can change a coefficient by 1, while Kolya can change it by 1 or 3. Kolya wins if, after one of the players' moves, the polynomial has integer roots. Is it true that Kolya can win regardless of the initial integer values of coefficients (a) and (b) and independent of Petya’s play?","completion":"1. **Initial Strategy for Kolya**: Kolya will first focus on changing the coefficient b until b falls within the interval [-2,0]. Kolya has the freedom to either add 1 or 3 to b. Petya, by changing the coefficients by 1, cannot prevent Kolya from achieving this strategic modification. 2. **Case: b = 0**: If Kolya sets b = 0, the resultant quadratic trinomial is x^2 + ax, which has integer roots since b=0 implies that the polynomial x^2 + ax + 0 = x(x + a) = 0. Thus, the roots are 0 and -a, which are integers regardless of a. Kolya wins immediately in this scenario. 3. **Case: b = -1**: If Kolya changes b and it becomes -1, Petya must then subtract 1 from b to avoid immediate loss, because if they don't, Kolya will change b to 0 in the next move and win. Therefore, Petya will set b = -2 in order to continue the game. 4. **Case: b = -2**: At this point, Petya can no longer modify b in a way to block Kolya. If b = -1 or b = -3, Kolya can add 1 or 3 respectively on the subsequent move to make b = 0. Thus Koalya can always adjust b to ultimately achieve a coefficient of 0. 5. **Kolya's Next Steps with Coefficient a**: After ensuring b is within the required interval, Kolya can now focus on changing the coefficient a by 3 until a falls within the interval [-1, 1]. 6. **Subcases for a**: - If Kolya sets a = 1 or a = -1: The quadratic trinomial becomes x^2 pm x - 2, which has integer roots. Since the trinomial factors as x^2 - x - 2 = (x - 2)(x + 1) or x^2 + x - 2 = (x - 1)(x + 2). Both of these trinomials have integer roots, confirming Kolya's victory. - If a = 0: The polynomial will later be adjusted by either Kolya or Petya to ensure it remains within the interval ensuring integer roots. Such a move guarantees a trinomial with the form x^2 + bx + c having integer solutions. # Conclusion Kolya can always strategize in such a manner to either adjust coefficient b or a within certain intervals to force a polynomial with integer roots, no matter how Petya plays within the given constraints.

Let us recall their definitions: - ( M, N, O ) are the midpoints of segments ( [BC], [AC], [AB] ) respectively. - ( P, Q, R ) are the feet of the altitudes from vertices ( A, B, C ) respectively. **Step 2: Showing (N, O, Q, R) are concyclic** As we are considering the properties of angles, we should leverage the fact that certain angles involving heights in a triangle are right angles: - Angle ( angle BQR ) and angle ( angle CQR ) are both right angles, implying that ( B, C, Q, R ) are concyclic. - Let's denote this circle by (C_1). **Step 3: Applying properties of cyclic quadrilaterals** In cyclic quadrilaterals, the opposite angles sum up to (180^circ). Given that: [ angle BQR = angle BCR = 90^circ ] All angles around point ( Q ) and ( R ): [ angle BQR ~=~ angle QRC ~=~ 90^circ ] Thus, [ angle BQR + angle QRC ~=~ 180^circ ] So, ( B,C, Q, R ) are concyclic. **Step 4: Midpoint theorem and equal segments** We know that ( N ) and ( O ) are midpoints of ( [BC] ) and ( [AB] ) respectively. Given the perpendicular bisectors, and the fact we have already shown: Let ( B, C, Q, R ) are concyclic, the following expression hold: [ AB times AR = AC times AQ ] Since ( N, O ) are midpoints, we have: [ 2 times AO times AR = 2 times AN times AQ ] Which simplifies to: [ AO times AR = AN times AQ ] Thus: [ N, O, Q, R ] lie on a common circle denoted by (C_1). **Step 5: Considering another circles passing through other sets of points** - Define circle ( C_2 ) that passes through ( O, M, P, R ), - Define circle ( C_3 ) that passes through ( N, M, P, Q ). **Step 6: Radical axes and concurrency** The radical axes of the circles (C_1, C_2, C_3) are lines, possibly concurring at a single point. They correspond to lines: - ( (AB) ), - ( (BC) ), - ( (CA) ). **Step 7: The circles are the same** The circles (C_1, C_2, C_3 ) intersect at four points forming another circle (Euler's circle). Because their radical axes include the triangle sides which imply that: - Not being concurrent, not parallel, but equivalent circles validates the proof.

By the triangle inequality, we have: [ x + y geq d_i ] The probability (P(e_i)) that a line parallel to one side of the square intersects the segment (l_i) is given by the average of the projections: [ P(e_i) = frac{x + y}{2} ] Using the inequality (x + y geq d_i), we get: [ P(e_i) geq frac{d_i}{2} ] 5. **Calculate the expected value of intersections:** The expected value (E) of the number of intersections of a line parallel to the sides of the square with the broken line is the sum of the probabilities (P(e_i)) for all segments (l_i): [ E = P(e_1) + P(e_2) + ldots + P(e_n) ] Using the inequality (P(e_i) geq frac{d_i}{2}), we get: [ E geq frac{d_1}{2} + frac{d_2}{2} + ldots + frac{d_n}{2} ] Since the total length of the broken line is greater than (1000), we have: [ d_1 + d_2 + ldots + d_n > 1000 ] Therefore: [ frac{d_1}{2} + frac{d_2}{2} + ldots + frac{d_n}{2} > frac{1000}{2} = 500 ] 6. **Conclusion:** The expected value of the number of intersections is greater than (500). By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one line parallel to a side of the square that intersects the broken line in at least (501) points.

The derivative is calculated as follows: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(ln x - x) = frac{1}{x} - 1. Let the point of tangency be (x_0, ln x_0 - x_0). The slope of the tangent line at this point is given by f'(x_0) = frac{1}{x_0} - 1. The equation of the tangent line can be expressed using the point-slope form: y - (ln x_0 - x_0) = (frac{1}{x_0} - 1)(x - x_0). Since the tangent line passes through the origin (0,0), we substitute these values into the equation to find x_0: 0 - (ln x_0 - x_0) = (frac{1}{x_0} - 1)(0 - x_0) Rightarrow x_0 - ln x_0 = x_0 - 1. Solving this equation gives x_0 = e. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line is: y = frac{1-e}{e}x.

We find the derivative of g(x) to determine its behavior: g'(x) = frac{(x-1)(ln x - x + 2)}{e^x}. Let h(x) = ln x - x + 2 for x geq 1. The derivative of h(x) is: h'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 1 = frac{1-x}{x} leq 0, indicating that h(x) is monotonically decreasing on [1, +infty). Since h(3) > 0 and h(4) < 0, there exists x_0 in (3, 4) such that h(x_0) = 0, i.e., ln x_0 - x_0 + 2 = 0. For x in (1, x_0), h(x) > 0 implies g'(x) > 0 and g(x) is monotonically increasing. For x in (x_0, +infty), h(x) < 0 implies g'(x) < 0 and g(x) is monotonically decreasing. Therefore, the maximum value of g(x) occurs at x_0, giving g(x)_{max} = frac{x_0}{e^{x_0}}. Since ln x_0 - x_0 + 2 = 0, we have x_0 = frac{e^{x_0}}{e^2}, which implies frac{x_0}{e^{x_0}} = frac{1}{e^2}. Thus, the maximum value of g(x) is frac{1}{e^2}.

This implies that f(x+1) = f(-(x+1)). Due to this symmetry, we can conclude that f(x) is symmetric about the line x=1. Therefore, **option A** is correct. 2. **Odd Function Property**: The function y=f(x+2) is an odd function. This implies that f(x+2) = -f(-(x+2)). However, determining f(x)'s symmetry about the line x=2 directly from this property may be less straightforward. Instead, it suggests that the function has rotational symmetry about the point (2,0), which does not directly imply that the axis of symmetry for f(x) is the line x=2. Therefore, without further evidence, we cannot confirm **option B** as correct. 3. **Periodicity**: Given that f(x+4)=f(1+x+3)=f(1-(x+3))=f(-x-2)=-f(x+2)=-f(1+(1+x))=-f(1-(1+x))=-f(-x)=f(x), this complex chain of equalities and negations confirms that f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 4. This is due to the property of odd functions and even functions combined with the given transformations. Since the base function within the domain [0,1] is f(x)=2^{x}-1, and we have established the function is periodic with a period of 4, we can deduce that the equation f(x)-x=0 will have solutions that repeat with this periodicity. Given the base function's behavior, it's reasonable to conclude it will intersect with the line y=x at least once within each period, leading to **option C** being correct because there are three periods in the domain considered for the equation f(x)-x=0. 4. **Summation of Function Values**: Considering the periodic nature and the given values of f(x) in the first period, we find: - f(1)=1, from the given function for xin [0,1]. - f(2)=0, as the function y=f(x+2) being odd implies f(2)= -f(0)=-(2^0-1)=-1+1=0. - f(3)=f(2+1)=-f(2-1)=-f(1)=-1, using the property of the function being odd around x+2. - f(4)=f(0)=0, due to the periodicity with a period of 4. Since f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)=1+0-1+0=0, and the function is periodic with a period of 4, the sum f(1)+f(2)+f(3)+ldots+f(2023) repeats this pattern.

As 3 in [2, 5), this is within our interval of interest. The maximum value of the function occurs at the axis of symmetry, so: f(3) = -(3)^2 + 6(3) - 3 = -9 + 18 - 3 = 6. To find the minimum value within the interval, we evaluate the function at the endpoints. Since the parabola is downwards and the left endpoint (x=2) is not beyond the axis of symmetry, the minimum must occur at the right endpoint of the interval.

Since T_n is the arithmetic mean, it must be greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the sequence 4^{1/n}, 4^{2/n}, ldots, 4^{n/n}. The product of the numbers in this sequence is a power of 4: 4^{1/n} cdot 4^{2/n} cdot ldots cdot 4^{n/n} = 4^{sum_{j=1}^{n} (j/n)} = 4^{(n+1)/2} > 4^{n/2} Thus, the geometric mean of the sequence is: sqrt[n]{4^{n/2}} = 2 Hence, T_n > 2 This proves the left inequality. 3. For an upper bound, we consider n being even or odd: - If n is even, set n = 2m. The terms 4^{j/n} for j=1, 2, ldots, m are bounded by 4^{1/2} = 2, and for j = m+1, ldots, n, the terms are bounded by 4. Therefore, 4^{1/n} + 4^{2/n} + ldots + 4^{n/n} leq m cdot 2 + m cdot 4 = m(2 + 4) = 6m = 3n - If n is odd, let n = 2m + 1. For j = 1, 2, ldots, m, 4^{j/n} is still less than 2. For j = m+1, we know: 4^{j/n} leq 4^{2/3} < 3 and for j = m+2, ldots, n, 4^{j/n} leq 4.

The total area of this polygon, consisting of two trapezoids, is: frac{3}{4} + frac{6}{4} = frac{9}{4} This gives the inequality: T_n - frac{3}{n} leq frac{9}{4} Simplifying, we get: n T_n = 4^{1/n} + 4^{2/n} + ldots + 4^{n/n} leq frac{9}{4}n + 3 For n geq 4, frac{9}{4}n + 3 leq 3n, thus proving the right inequality.

The scaling and vertical shift transform the pentagon in a more complex way, not merely rotating or flipping. 2. **Understand Transformations**: - R_5 repeated 5 times will complete a full rotation: R_5^5 = I. - H^2 = I as it is a reflection. - S_2 does not immediately transform to I without inverse scaling: S_2 circ S_{1/2} = I. - V needs to be offset by an inverse vertical shift V^{-1} downwards 1 unit: V circ V^{-1} = I. 3. **Check Transformations Combinations**: - Denote S_{1/2} as scaling by 0.5 and V^{-1} as vertical shift downwards by 1 unit for recording simplicity. - Determine valid combinations: (R_5, R_5^{-1}), (H, H), (S_2, S_{1/2}), (V, V^{-1}) must each pair within sequences. 4. **Calculate Number of Valid Sequences**: - There are 4^{15} possible sequences. To ensure identity transformation, each transformative action must be offset by its respective inverse. - Require that scaling and vertical shift actions appear in balanced pairs, and rotations and reflections contribute to a net identity transformation. Much like balancing equations in a group-based structure, each transformation is paired to form I. 5. **Simplifying Calculation**: - Group theory and combinatorial structuring imply the sequences must balance, similarly to tasks involving combinations of independent complementary pairs. - The valid sequence count becomes paired, but this problem's complexity with scaled and shifted elements makes direct calculation speculative without deeper group-theoretic analysis.

Therefore: [ (a - b)^2 = 0, quad (b - c)^2 = 0, quad (c - a)^2 = 0 ] This implies: [ a = b = c ] 2. Given that (a = b = c), substitute back into the original equation: [ a^2 + a^2 + a^2 = 2(aa + aa + aa) ] Simplifying, we get: [ 3a^2 = 6a^2 ] Dividing both sides by (3a^2) (assuming (a neq 0)): [ 1 = 2 ] This is a contradiction, so our assumption that (a = b = c) must be incorrect. 3.

Show that if n>t!cdot e then at least one class M_z contains three elements x_{i} , x_{j} , x_{k} with the property that x_{i}x_{j}=x_{k} .","completion":"1. **Introduction and Setup**: We are given a set ( M = {1, 2, ldots, n} ) which is partitioned into ( t ) disjoint subsets ( M_1, M_2, ldots, M_t ) such that the cardinality of ( M_i ) is ( m_i ) and ( m_i ge m_{i+1} ) for ( i = 1, ldots, t-1 ). We need to show that if ( n > t! cdot e ), then at least one subset ( M_z ) contains three elements ( x_i, x_j, x_k ) such that ( x_i - x_j = x_k ). 2. **Using Schur's Theorem**: This problem is a direct application of Schur's Theorem, which states that for any partition of the set ( {1, 2, ldots, S_t} ) into ( t ) subsets, there exists a subset containing three elements ( a, b, c ) such that ( a + b = c ). Here, ( S_t ) is defined as the smallest number such that any partition of ( {1, 2, ldots, S_t} ) into ( t ) subsets contains a monochromatic solution to the equation ( a + b = c ). 3. **Approximation of ( e )**: Using the Taylor series expansion for ( e ), we have: [ e = 1 + frac{1}{1!} + frac{1}{2!} + frac{1}{3!} + ldots ] Therefore, ( t! cdot e ) can be approximated as: [ t! cdot e = t! left(1 + frac{1}{1!} + frac{1}{2!} + ldots + frac{1}{t!} + frac{1}{(t+1)!} + ldots right) ] Since the terms (frac{1}{(t+1)!} + frac{1}{(t+2)!} + ldots) are very small, we can approximate: [ t! cdot e approx t! left(1 + 1 + frac{1}{2!} + ldots + frac{1}{t!}right) ] 4. **Recurrence Relation**: The sequence ( S_t ) satisfies the recurrence relation: [ S_t = t S_{t-1} + 1 ] with ( S_0 = 1 ). This can be derived from the properties of the exponential function and the factorial. 5. **Partition Argument**: Consider a partition of the set ( {1, 2, ldots, S_t} ) into ( t ) subsets. Assume no subset contains three elements ( a, b, c ) such that ( a + b = c ). Since ( t nmid S_t ), at least one subset, say ( X_1 ), must contain at least ( leftlfloor frac{S_t}{t} rightrfloor + 1 = S_{t-1} + 1 ) elements. 6. **Inductive Step**: Let ( x_1 < x_2 < ldots < x_k ) be the elements of ( X_1 ), where ( k = S_{t-1} + 1 ). The differences ( y_i = x_{i+1} - x_1 ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k-1 ) do not lie in ( X_1 ). These differences must lie in the remaining ( t-1 ) subsets. By similar arguments, at least ( leftlfloor frac{S_{t-1}}{t-1} rightrfloor + 1 = S_{t-2} + 1 ) of these differences must lie in the same subset, say ( X_2 ). 7. **Continuing the Process**: Continuing this process, we find that there are at least ( S_{t-k} + 1 ) elements in the same subset ( X_k ). Finally, the set ( X_t ) will contain at least ( S_0 + 1 = 2 ) elements, say ( a < b ). But then ( b - a ) must lie in one of the sets ( X_1, ldots, X_t ), say ( X_i ). 8. **Contradiction**: The above arguments show that ( a ) and ( b ) are of the form ( q_m - q_r ) and ( q_n - q_r ), where ( q_r < q_m < q_n ) are in ( X_i ). Then ( b - a = q_n - q_m in X_i ), leading to a contradiction. 9. **Conclusion**: Therefore, if ( n > t! cdot e ), then at least one subset ( M_z ) contains three elements ( x_i, x_j, x_k ) such that ( x_i - x_j = x_k ).

Let's perform the necessary algebraic manipulations on the expression inside the absolute value: [ left| frac{1 + 3n}{6 - n} + 3 right| ] We transform the fraction to have a common denominator: [ left| frac{1 + 3n + 3(6 - n)}{6 - n} right| ] 4. Simplify inside the numerator: [ 1 + 3n + 3 cdot 6 - 3n = 1 + 3n + 18 - 3n = 19 ] Thus, the expression becomes: [ left| frac{19}{6 - n} right| = left| frac{19}{n - 6} right| ] 5. Since n - 6 is positive for sufficiently large n, we can drop the absolute value: [ frac{19}{n - 6} < varepsilon ] 6. Solving for n: [ n - 6 > frac{19}{varepsilon} ] [ n > frac{19}{varepsilon} + 6 ] 7. Therefore, let: [ N(varepsilon) = leftlceil frac{19}{varepsilon} + 6 rightrceil ] This integer N(varepsilon) guarantees that for all n geq N(varepsilon), the inequality left| frac{1 + 3n}{6 - n} + 3 right| < varepsilon holds true. 8.

Since b and u are reals, solve for a suitable b that keeps u in real coordinates while satisfying the parallel line properties. Letting b = 4/sqrt{3} yields U = (1, 14). - PQRSTU is symmetric around AB. Specifically, overline{QR} and overline{AB} are parallel and equal, as are overline{RS} and overline{UV}. Hence, the hexagon can be divided into three parallelograms (ABQR, AVUP, and BCRS) and one smaller hexagon at the center. The heights of the parallelograms are 2, and the bases, depending on the x-coordinates, can be found from b and u values. - Area calculation: - For parallelograms ABQR and BCRS, the areas are each b*2 = 4/sqrt{3}*2 = 8/sqrt{3} = frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} each. - The hexagon in the middle with side lengths equal to b = 4/sqrt{3} gives area calculation as frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} left(frac{4}{sqrt{3}}right)^2 = 16. - Adds up the areas: frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} + frac{8sqrt{3}}{3} + 16 = frac{16sqrt{3}}{3} + 16 = frac{16sqrt{3} + 48}{3}. - Thus, m + n = boxed{16 + 3 = 19} (Assuming sqrt{3} and 3 are not simplified further)."},{"prompt":"A rogue spaceship escapes. 54 minutes later the police leave in a spaceship in hot pursuit.

First, we note the following inequality: [ left( sum a(b+c) right) left( sum frac{a}{b+c} right) geq left( sum a right)^2 ] This is a form of the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality (in its Titu's lemma form): [ left( sum_{i=1}^n frac{a_i^2}{b_i} right) left( sum_{i=1}^n b_i right) geq left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i right)^2 ] 2. We can apply the sum ( sum a(b+c) ) in the form: [ sum a(b+c) = a(b+c) + b(c+d) + c(d+a) + d(a+b) ] 3. Calculating ( sum a(b+c) ): [ begin{aligned} sum a(b+c) & = a(b+c) + b(c+d) + c(d+a) + d(a+b) & = ab + ac + bc + bd + cd + da end{aligned} ] 4.

The right-hand side ((a+b+c+d)^2) expands to: [ begin{aligned} (a+b+c+d)^2 & = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) end{aligned} ] 7. Thus, we need to show: [ begin{aligned} 2ab + 2ac + 2ad + 2bc + 2bd + 2cd & leq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) end{aligned} ] 8.

Simplifying the above gives: [ 0 leq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ] which is always true for all positive (a, b, c,) and (d). 10. Therefore: [ 2 sum a(b+c) leq (a+b+c+d)^2 ] 11. Relating the previous inequalities: [ frac{left( sum a right)^2}{sum a(b+c)} leq sum frac{a}{b+c} ] 12.

This operation results in the function y=cos(x-frac{pi}{3}). This transformation does not alter the vertical coordinates but shifts every point on the graph horizontally to the right. 2. **Horizontal Compression to Half of the Original**: After the shift, the next step is to compress the horizontal coordinate to half of its original value, while keeping the vertical coordinate unchanged. This operation transforms the function to y=cos(2x-frac{pi}{3}). This compression effectively scales the x-values, making the graph \\"narrower\\" or \\"compressed\\" horizontally. Alternatively, if we consider the transformation steps in a different order: 1. **Horizontal Compression to Half of the Original**: Initially, compressing the graph of y=cos x horizontally to half of its original width (without changing the vertical coordinate) results in the function y=cos 2x. This step scales the x-values by a factor of 2, compressing the graph horizontally. 2. **Shifting the Graph to the Right by frac{pi}{6} Units**: Following the compression, shifting the graph to the right by frac{pi}{6} units leads to the function y=cos[2(x-frac{pi}{6})], which simplifies to y=cos(2x-frac{pi}{3}). This shift moves every point on the graph horizontally to the right, without affecting the vertical coordinates. Given these transformations, we can conclude that both sequences of transformations (first shifting then compressing, and first compressing then shifting) are valid interpretations of how to obtain the graph of y=cos(2x-frac{pi}{3}) from the graph of y=cos x.

So initially, Heloise has: - Dogs: 10 parts * 9 pets/part = 90 dogs - Cats: 17 parts * 9 pets/part = 153 cats - Birds: 8 parts * 9 pets/part = 72 birds Now, let's apply the changes: 1.

The GCD of 75, 145, and 74 is 1 (since there are no common divisors greater than 1 for these three numbers). So the new ratio of dogs, cats, and birds is: - Dogs: 75 / 1 = 75 - Cats: 145 / 1 = 145 - Birds: 74 / 1 = 74 Therefore, the new ratio of dogs to cats to birds is boxed{75:145:74} ."},{"prompt":"the geometric sequence {a_n}, let S_n be the sum of the first n terms.

Let’s express the product of the first k terms: [ prod_{i=1}^{k} a_i = prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{b_i} ] where ( p_i ) are prime numbers and ( b_i ) are some integers. 4. **Representation of ( x )**: Let’s represent the number ( x ) (which doesn’t appear in the first k terms) in its prime factorization: [ x = prod_{i=1}^{m} p_i^{c_i} ] 5. **Choosing ( a_{k+1} )**: We need to select ( a_{k+1} ) in such a way that: [ prod_{i=1}^{k+1} a_i = left( prod_{i=1}^{k} a_i right) a_{k+1} ] can still be written as a (k+1)-th power of an integer.

So in 3 hours, she would paint: 6 rose cups/hour * 3 hours = 18 rose cups However, the order was for 6 rose cups, not 18. This means Gina spent part of her 3 hours painting the 6 rose cups. Let's find out how much time she spent on the rose cups: 6 rose cups / 6 rose cups/hour = 1 hour So, Gina spent 1 hour painting rose cups. Since she worked for 3 hours in total, she spent the remaining time painting lily cups: 3 hours - 1 hour = 2 hours Now, let's calculate how many lily cups she painted in those 2 hours.

The only possible move is to subtract 1, reducing the number to 1 (which is a losing position). Therefore, the player receiving a 2 has a winning position if they reduce it to 1, thereafter forcing a loss on their opponent. Hence, 2 is a winning position ( W ). - For 3, the possible moves are to subtract 1.

Denote k as the position of the last 0 in the path (where n leq k leq 2n-1). - Example representation (figure): - For a 4 times 4 grid, the path 01010011 is an eastern path. 4. **Calculating Expected Number of Turns**: - Consider the beginning part of the path that contains exactly n-1 zeros and k-n ones. - Any pair of adjacent symbols in the path may indicate a turn (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0): thus a turn can occur at such pairs. 5. **Probability Calculations**: - The probability that a random pair of adjacent symbols in the beginning part of the path is 01: [ frac{n-1}{k-1} cdot frac{k-n}{k-2} ] - The probability for the pair 10 is the same: [ frac{k-n}{k-1} cdot frac{n-1}{k-2} ] 6. **Mathematical Expectation per Pair of Symbols**: - Thus, the probability that a pair of adjacent symbols represents a turn is: [ frac{2(n-1)(k-n)}{(k-1)(k-2)} ] 7. **Summing Over All Possible Initial Paths**: - Introduce the indicator I_j for the event that the pair of adjacent symbols at positions j and j+1 represents a turn in the beginning part of the path. - The expectation of the indicator I_j: [ mathbb{E} I_j = frac{2(n-1)(k-n)}{(k-1)(k-2)} ] - Summing these expectations over all k-2 pairs: [ (k-2) cdot frac{2(n-1)(k-n)}{(k-1)(k-2)} = frac{2(n-1)(k-n)}{k-1} ] 8. **Considering Additional Turn If Last Zero is Followed by One**: - Additional turn if the position k-1 has a 1, with probability: [ frac{k-n}{k-1} ] - Thus, the expected number of turns in path of length k: [ frac{2(n-1)(k-n)}{k-1} + frac{k-n}{k-1} = frac{(2n-1)(k-n)}{k-1} ] 9. **Total Expected Turns**: - Summing contributions from all valid k: [ mathbb{E} Y = 2 sum_{k=n}^{2n-1} frac{{k-1 choose n-1}(2n-1)(k-n)}{2^k (k-1)} ] - Simplify the sum: [ mathbb{E} Y = 2(2n-1) sum_{k=n+1}^{2n-1} frac{{k-1 choose n-1}}{2^k} ] 10. **Final Computation Using Combinatorial Identity**: - Transform and simplify: [ sum_{k=n+1}^{2n-1} frac{{k-1 choose n-1}}{2^k} = frac{1}{2^{2n-1}} sum_{k=n+1}^{2n-1} {k-1 choose n-1} cdot 2^{2n-1-k} ] - Use combinatorial identity and Stirling Approximation: [ sum_{j=b}^{a} {j choose b} cdot 2^{a-j} = sum_{j=b+1}^{a+1} {a+1 choose j} ] - Final calculation results: [ mathbb{E} X approx n + frac{1}{2} - left( n - frac{1}{2} right) frac{1}{sqrt{pi (n-1)}} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{n + frac{1}{2} - left( n - frac{1}{2} right) frac{1}{sqrt{pi (n-1)}}} ]"},{"prompt":"A number divided by 0.04 gives 100.9.

Let's begin by analyzing the problem and breaking down the solution step-by-step. 1. Analyzing the Problem: We need to use eight 2 times 1 domino-like tiles to form a 4 times 4 square. The constraint is that each diagonal of the 4 times 4 square must comprise tiles of a single color. Furthermore, we count two arrangements as identical if one can be obtained from the other by rotation. 2. Configuration of Dominos: - A 4 times 4 square is composed of 16 unit squares. - Since each 2 times 1 domino covers 2 unit squares, we require exactly 8 dominoes to cover the full area of the 4 times 4 grid without overlap. 3. Constructing Valid Configurations: We need to ensure that any configuration respects the diagonal constraints: - For a domino configuration to have its diagonals aligned in such a restricted manner, place all horizontal or vertical dominos and observe symmetry through rotations. 4. Determine each Unique Configuration: - Each configuration needs to be evaluated considering its symmetry on rotation [0°, 90°, 180°, 270°]. 5. Enumerate Unique Patterns: There are limited configurations satisfying the diagonal constraint for dominos: 1. Each diagram's layout accounting for fixed diagonals and their rotations ensures the enumerated uniqueness. 6.

We have n coins aligned from left to right. Each coin can be in one of two states: heads (H) or tails (T). 2. At each step of the process, if there are k coins showing tails from the left, we flip the k-th coin (starting from 1). If all coins are showing heads, the process stops. 3. To show that the process will always terminate, consider the following argument: - Let's represent the state of the n coins using a binary string of length n, where 0 represents heads (H) and 1 represents tails (T). - Define a binary string S_0 S_1 S_2 ldots S_{n-1} where S_i in {0, 1}. - Define the \\"value\\" of this binary string, V(S), as the sum of the binary values of the string sum_{i=0}^{n-1} S_i cdot 2^i. Notice that each value of the string corresponds to a unique configuration of the coins. 4. At each step, we flip the k-th coin (where k is one-based index of the last tails coin from the left). Let's denote the state before flipping as S. When we flip the k-th coin, we will always reduce the binary value of this string because: - Prior to the flip, the string has the k-th bit as 1 (which represents the k-th coin showing tails). - Flipping the k-th coin changes this bit from 1 to 0, which will decrease the binary value. Thus, each step irrevocably reduces the binary value of the string until it reaches zero. 5. Since the binary value can only decrease and it starts finite, eventually, the binary string will reach all zeros (all coins showing heads), at which point the process halts. Therefore, the process always terminates. Part 2: Calculating the average number of steps 1. We need to calculate the average number of steps needed for the process to terminate over all possible initial configurations of the coins. 2. There are 2^n possible initial configurations (each coin can be heads or tails). 3. For each configuration, represent it again using a binary string. The number of steps required for any initial configuration can be evaluated by counting the total number of steps to make all bits zero. Let's exemplify by calculating the number of steps for a given binary string: - For a string of length 3 (\`n=3\`), consider the configuration \`101\`: - The value of string \`101\` (in binary) is 1 cdot 2^0 + 0 cdot 2^1 + 1 cdot 2^2 = 5. - The steps are: - Flip the 3rd coin: \`101\` becomes \`100\` (value decreases from 5 to 4). - Flip the 1st coin: \`100\` becomes \`101\` (value fluctuates but heads increase). - Repeat until all bits are zero. 4. Since a rigorous and exhaustive calculation over all 2^n configurations is computationally intensive, we resort to combinatorial or probabilistic methods to generalize the average. We derive that the expected number of steps to reach all heads, given the number of coins n, grows logarithmically as a harmonic number: E(n) = sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} Conclusion: The average number of steps required is the harmonic number H_n summed up to \`n\`. boxed{H_n = sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{k}}"},{"prompt":"Let A,B,C be points in that order along a line, such that AB=20 and BC=18 .

Step 1: Understanding the Pairing Concept Given the constraints, each segment must intersect exactly one other segment. This implies that the segments can be paired. In other words, we can form pairs of intersecting segments. Step 2: Parity Argument Since each segment intersects exactly one other segment, the total number of segments must be even. This is because an odd number of segments would leave at least one segment unpaired. Step 3: Part (a) - 1996 Segments 1996 is an even number.

The volume of can B (V_B) is: V_B = πr²h The volume of can V (V_V) is: V_V = π(2r)²(h/2) = π(4r²)(h/2) = 2πr²h So, the volume of can V is twice the volume of can B. If it costs 16 to completely fill can V, then it would cost 16/2 = 8 to fill half of can V. Since the volume of can V is twice the volume of can B, filling half of can V is equivalent to filling the whole of can B. Therefore, it costs 8 to fill can B completely. Since we want to know the cost to fill half of can B, we divide this amount by 2: 8 / 2 = 4 So, it costs boxed{4} to fill half of can B with gasoline."},{"prompt":"a right triangle DEF with angle E = 90^circ, we have 3sin D = 4cos D.

For instance, if we take ( a_1 = 1 ) and ( a_2 = 2 ), then the sum ( a_1 + a_2 = 3 ) is a single sum, which is trivially consecutive. 3. **Inductive step:** Suppose ( n ) is good. This means there exist positive integers ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_k ) such that the sums ( a_i + a_j ) for ( 1 leq i < j leq k ) include ( n ) consecutive integers, say ( t+1, t+2, ldots, t+n ). 4. **Case 1: ( t+n+1 ) is among the sums:** If ( t+n+1 ) is already among the sums, then we have ( n+1 ) consecutive integers, and thus ( n+1 ) is good. 5. **Case 2: ( t+n+1 ) is not among the sums:** If ( t+n+1 ) is not among the sums, we need to construct a new set of integers ( a_1', a_2', ldots, a_{k+1}' ) such that the sums include ( t+1, t+2, ldots, t+n+1 ). Consider the integers: [ t+n+1 - a_{k+1} < a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_k < a_{k+1} ] where ( a_{k+1} ) is a sufficiently large positive integer that ensures all sums are pairwise distinct. 6. **Ensuring ( t+n+1 - a_{k+1} ) is positive:** To ensure ( t+n+1 - a_{k+1} ) is positive, we can add a large integer ( M ) to all ( a_i ). This does not affect the pairwise distinctness of the sums but shifts all sums by ( 2M ). Thus, we can always choose ( M ) such that ( t+n+1 - a_{k+1} + M > 0 ). 7. **Conclusion:** By the inductive step, if ( n ) is good, then ( n+1 ) is good. Since ( 1 ) is good, by induction, every positive integer is good. Therefore, ( 1000 ) is good.

Since each triangle has 3 choices, the probability is: [ left(frac{1}{3}right)^6 = frac{1}{729} ] 7. **Expected Number of Full Circles:** The expected number of full circles is the product of the number of vertices that can form full circles and the probability of forming a full circle at each vertex: [ E = frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{2} times frac{1}{729} ] 8. **Simplifying the Expression:** [ E = frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{2 times 729} = frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{1458} ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{1458}})."},{"prompt":"The sets ( M = {u mid u = 12m + 8n + 4l, : m, n, l in mathbb{Z}} ) and ( N = {u mid u = 20p + 16q + 12r, : p, q, r in mathbb{Z}} ).

Let's denote h(t) = (2e-t)ln t. The derivative of h(t) is h'(t) = frac{2e}{t} - 1 - ln t. Solving for h'(t) = 0, we get t = e. Therefore, h(t) is increasing when t in (0, e) and decreasing when t in (e, +infty). Since frac{1}{a} leq h(e) = e, it follows that a geq frac{1}{e} or a < 0.

We need to show that the 6 pairwise channels between them do not all have the same encryption key. - **Case 1: Four users are from three different sets (I_k, I_ell, I_m) with (k < ell < m):** In this case, at least two different keys (k) and (ell) are used among the channels.

Let's denote the number of items sold without the discount as N. The total profit without the discount is: Total profit = N * 60 With the discount, the profit per item is reduced by the amount of the discount, so the new profit per item is: New profit per item = 60 - 30 = 30 The retailer needs to sell at least 222.22222222222223 items to justify the discount policy.

We aim to show that if each of the 33 line segments connecting these points is colored either red or blue, there will always be a monochromatic triangle. 3. Consider the complete graph K_9. A complete graph on 9 vertices has binom{9}{2} = 36 edges. 4. If we have 33 edges colored, exactly 3 edges remain uncolored. We need to show the existence of a monochromatic triangle in this setting. 5. Select any 3 points from the 9 points. If an edge among these three points is uncolored, then the remaining edges in the graph form a subgraph K_6 on the remaining 6 points, which is 2-colored. 6. By the Ramsey theorem, specifically R(3,3)=6, any 2-colored complete graph on 6 vertices will contain a monochromatic triangle. This means that within the subgraph K_6, there must be a set of 3 points such that all the connecting edges between them are of the same color, i.e., a monochromatic triangle. # Conclusion: Thus, the minimum number of line segments n needed so that there always exists a monochromatic triangle regardless of how we color each line segment is n = 33. boxed{33}"},{"prompt":"Two rays with a common endpoint O form a 45^circ angle.

Specifically, let's denote the lengths of the sticks by ( t^3 ), ( t^2 ), and ( t ). 2. **Condition for Forming a Triangle**: For three lengths ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) to form a triangle, the following inequality must hold: [ a + b > c, ] where ( c ) is the largest of the three lengths. In our case: [ t^3 > t^2 + t. ] If we consider the polynomial ( P(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 ), we need to determine if there is a value ( t > 1 ) for which ( P(t) = 0 ). 3. **Finding Root of Polynomial**: We need to show that there exists a root ( t ) of the polynomial ( P(x) = x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 ) such that ( P(t) = 0 ). Evaluate ( P(x) ) at ( x = 1 ) and ( x = 2 ): [ P(1) = 1^3 - 1^2 - 1 - 1 = -2 < 0, ] [ P(2) = 2^3 - 2^2 - 2 - 1 = 8 - 4 - 2 - 1 = 1 > 0. ] Since ( P(x) ) is continuous (a property of polynomials) and changes sign between 1 and 2, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists a ( t in (1, 2) ) such that ( P(t) = 0 ). 4. **Reexamining Triangle Inequality with Stick Lengths**: Given ( t ) that satisfies ( P(t) = 0 ), the stick lengths are ( t^3 ), ( t^2 ), and ( t ). [ t^3 = t^2 + t + 1. ] Therefore, the sum of the lengths of the other two sticks (( t^2 + t )) is less than ( t^3 ): [ t^3 > t^2 + t. ] This implies that a triangle cannot be formed with these lengths. 5. **Post-Reduction Analysis**: After shortening the longest stick from ( t^3 ) to ( t^2 + t ), the new lengths of the sticks will be ( t^2, t, text{ and } 1 ). 6. **Repeating the Operation**: Since the proportions of the sticks remain the same (( t^2, t, text{ and } 1 )), the above analysis applies each time, leading to infinitely repeating the process. # Conclusion: Thus, the process of shortening the longest stick will continue indefinitely without the possibility of forming a triangle with these lengths.

The game ends when all edges are oriented. Alice wins if and only if there is a cycle. We need to determine if there is a winning strategy for Alice. 1. **Constructing a Chain**: - Alice can aim to form a chain in the graph. A chain is a sequence of distinct vertices where each vertex is connected to the next by an oriented edge. - At each of her turns, Alice should take the longest existing chain she has formed and one vertex that is not already part of the chain. She then orients an edge from this new vertex to link it to the existing chain, effectively extending the chain. 2. **Ensuring Chain Extension**: - By always choosing to extend the longest chain, Alice ensures that the chain continues to grow. - With this strategy, at each step, the chain is extended by one vertex. 3. **Completion of the Chain**: - The maximal length of the chain in a graph with 2014 vertices reaches a maximum length of 2014 vertices. - Extending the chain in this manner requires at most 2013 turns since each new orientation extends the chain by one vertex. 4. **Number of Edges**: - The number of edges in a complete graph with 2014 vertices is given by the formula for the number of edges in a complete graph: [ binom{2014}{2} = frac{2014 cdot 2013}{2} = 2014 times 1006.5 = 2028111 , text{edges}. ] 5. **Alice’s Final Moves to Win**: - Given that Bob can orient up to 1000 edges per move and starting from the second move, each turn would mean that the game would end after at most: [ text{First turn} + lceil frac{text{Remaining edges}}{1001} rceil leq 1 + lceil frac{2028111 - 1}{1001} rceil leq 1 + 2027 approx 2028 , text{turns}. ] - Thus, Alice needs at most 2014 of those to ensure every pair of vertices is indirectly connected by the chain. 6. **Creating a Cycle**: - Now that all vertices are connected in a chain and surplus edges remain, Alice can form a cycle by orienting any remaining undirected edge in such a way that it closes a loop. - Specifically, she can take any undirected edge that connects two vertices already in the chain and orient it in a manner opposite to the current direction of her longest chain.

A second tap, working alone at its maximum constant rate, can fill the same sink in 214 seconds. If both taps work together at their respective maximum constant rates, how long will it take to fill the sink?","completion":"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of rates. Let's denote the rate at which the first tap fills the sink as R1 and the rate at which the second tap fills the sink as R2. The rate R1 is the amount of the sink filled per second by the first tap, which is 1/210 of the sink per second since it takes 210 seconds to fill the sink. Similarly, the rate R2 is 1/214 of the sink per second. When both taps are working together, their combined rate R is the sum of their individual rates: R = R1 + R2 R = 1/210 + 1/214 To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple (LCM) of 210 and 214 is 44870 (since 210 * 214 = 44870 and they have no common factors other than 1). So, converting both fractions to have the common denominator of 44870: R1 = (214/44870) of the sink per second R2 = (210/44870) of the sink per second Now, we can add these rates: R = R1 + R2 R = (214/44870) + (210/44870) R = (214 + 210) / 44870 R = 424 / 44870 This is the combined rate of both taps working together. To find the time it takes to fill the sink when both taps are working together, we take the reciprocal of the combined rate: Time = 1 / R Time = 44870 / 424 Time = 105.75 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{105.75} seconds to fill the sink when both taps are working together at their maximum constant rates."},{"prompt":"parallelogram ABCD, line DP is drawn trisecting BC at N (nearest to B) and meeting AB (extended) at P.

Let ( S ) denote the sum of the elements of ( M ), that is: [ S = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_m ] According to the problem statement, for every element ( a_i ) in ( M ), the absolute value of ( a_i ) is at least as large as the absolute value of the sum of the other ( m-1 ) elements. This can be expressed mathematically as: [ left|a_iright| geq left|S - a_iright| ] 2. **Inequality Simplification:** We express the condition ( left|a_iright| geq left|S - a_iright| ) as: [ -left|a_iright| leq S - a_i leq left|a_iright| ] 3. **Considering ( a_i geq 0 ):** If ( a_i ) is nonnegative, then ( left|a_iright| = a_i ), and we have: [ -a_i leq S - a_i leq a_i ] Simplifying this, we get: [ 0 leq S leq 2a_i quad text{(for } a_i geq 0text{)} ] 4. **Considering ( a_i leq 0 ):** If ( a_i ) is nonpositive, then ( left|a_iright| = -a_i ), and we have: [ a_i leq S - a_i leq -a_i ] Simplifying this, we get: [ 2a_i leq S leq 0 quad text{(for } a_i leq 0text{)} ] 5. **Existence of Nonnegative and Nonpositive Elements:** To prove that ( S = 0 ), it suffices to show that there exists both a nonnegative element and a nonpositive element in ( M ). Assuming ( M ) contained only positive elements, then ( S > 0 ). Summing up the inequality ( 0 leq S leq 2a_i ) for all ( i ) from 1 to ( m ), we get: [ 0 leq S leq 2a_1, quad 0 leq S leq 2a_2, quad ldots, quad 0 leq S leq 2a_m ] Adding these inequalities results in: [ 0 leq mS leq 2(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_m) = 2S ] Simplifies to: [ (m-2)S leq 0 ] 6. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** Since ( m > 2 ), ( m-2 ) is positive, hence ( (m-2)S leq 0 ) implies ( S leq 0 ). But, we previously stated that ( S > 0 ) for a positive sum, which is a contradiction. Thus, ( M ) cannot have all elements positive. Similarly, assuming all elements are negative would lead to ( S < 0 ), and summing inequalities ( 2a_i leq S leq 0 ) would yield a similar contradiction. Therefore, ( M ) must contain both nonnegative and nonpositive elements.

We have f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(2x^3 - 6x^2 + aright) = 6x^2 - 12x. Setting the derivative equal to zero will give us the potential extremal points: f'(x) = 6x^2 - 12x = 0, which simplifies to x(x - 2) = 0. Thus, the critical points are x = 0 and x = 2. However, we note that x = 2 is at the boundary of the interval and does not necessarily correspond to an extremum inside it. The function's increasing and decreasing behavior can be deduced from the sign of the derivative. The derivative is nonnegative (f'(x) geq 0) for x geq 2 or x leq 0. Therefore, f(x) is increasing on (-infty, 0] and [2, +infty), but it is decreasing on [0, 2] because f'(x) would be less or equal to zero in that interval. Since we are given that the function has a maximum value when x in [-2, 2], and knowing the increasing and decreasing behavior of the function, we can conclude: - f(x) is increasing on [-2, 0]. - f(x) is decreasing on [0, 2]. The maximum value of f(x) is given to be 3, which is reached at x = 0. Therefore, f(x) = 2x^3 - 6x^2 + 3.

Since f(-2) = -37 < f(2) = -5, the minimum value of f(x) on the interval [-2, 2] is f(-2) = -37.

Points ( B, C ) form tangents intersecting at ( D ) which lies on ( odot O ). 2. **Establish Concyclicity of Points ( A, M, E, F )**: By the problem's constraint, points ( A, M, E ), and ( F ) are concyclic.

Each leading digit will have: [ 3! = 6 ] permutations for the remaining 3 digits. 3. **List permutations by leading digit:** - Numbers starting with 1: [ 1234, 1243, 1324, 1342, 1423, 1432 ] These are the first 6 numbers in ascending order. - Numbers starting with 2: [ 2134, 2143, 2314, 2341, 2413, 2431 ] These are the next 6 numbers (positions 7 to 12). Thus, the permutations starting with 1 and 2 occupy positions 1 through 12. 4. **Identify permutations starting with 3:** The next set of numbers starts with 3. List these permutations: [ 3124, 3142, 3214, 3241, 3412, 3421 ] 5. **Determine the position of specific numbers starting with 3:** We need to find out where 3142 fits among these: - Order of permutations: [ 3124, 3142, 3214, 3241, 3412, 3421 ] We see that 3124 is in the 13th position, and then 3142 follows in the 14th position. # Conclusion: Thus, the number 3142 is in the 14th position.

Enter your answer in the form ( (r, theta) ), where ( r > 0 ) and ( 0 le theta < 2pi ).","completion":"1. **Calculate ( r )**: Compute the magnitude ( r ) of the point using the formula: [ r = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = sqrt{(-1)^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = sqrt{4} = 2. ] 2. **Determine ( theta )**: Since the point is in the second quadrant and we know ( tan(theta) = frac{y}{x} ), we calculate ( theta ) using the arctangent of ( frac{sqrt{3}}{-1} = -sqrt{3} ). To find the angle corresponding to the second quadrant, we proceed from ( frac{pi}{3} ) (the reference angle) and move to ( pi - frac{pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{3} ). Thus, the polar coordinates are ( boxed{(2, frac{2pi}{3})} )."},{"prompt":"Determine the true statement(s) from the following four propositions: ① If x_1 and x_2 are the two real roots of the quadratic equation ax^2+bx+c=0, with x_1<x_2, then the solution set for the inequality ax^2+bx+c<0 is {x|x_1<x<x_2}; ② If frac{x1}{x2}le0, then (x1)(x2)le0; ③ The contrapositive statement of If m>2, then the solution set for x^22x+m>0 is the set of all real numbers mathbb{R}; ④ For a function f(x) defined on mathbb{R} that satisfies f(x)=f(x) for all xin mathbb{R} and f(1+x)=f(1x), then 4 is a period for y=f(x).

However, this is only true when a>0. Since there is no information given about the sign of a, proposition ① might be false. Analyzing proposition ②, the inequality frac{x-1}{x-2}le0 implies that (x-1)(x-2)le0 given xneq2. The exclusion of the possibility x = 2 makes proposition ② incorrect as well. For proposition ③, we consider its original statement: \\"If m>2, then the solution set for x^2-2x+m>0 is the set of all real numbers mathbb{R}.\\" Its contrapositive statement would be \\"If the solution set for x^2-2x+m>0 is not the set of all real numbers mathbb{R}, then mle2,\\" which is true provided the original statement is true. As there's no reason to assume the original statement is false, we accept the contrapositive proposition ③ as true. Looking at proposition ④, given f(-x)=-f(x) and f(1+x)=f(1-x), we find that f(2+x)=f((1+x)+1)=f(1-(1+x))=f(-x)=-f(x). Consequently, f(4+x)=-f(2+x)=f(x), which means 4 is indeed a period of y=f(x), verifying proposition ④ as true. Therefore, the solutions are propositions ③ and ④.
