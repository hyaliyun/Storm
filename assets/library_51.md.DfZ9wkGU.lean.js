We need to determine the largest number of positive integers that can be among these numbers. 2. **Initial Observations:** - If two successive numbers (a_i) and (a_{i+1}) are both greater than or equal to 1, then (a_{i+2} > a_i a_{i+1} ge 1). This implies that the sequence would be strictly increasing, which is impossible in a circular arrangement because it would eventually contradict the initial values. 3. **Maximum Number of Integers:** - To avoid the sequence becoming strictly increasing, we need to ensure that not too many successive terms are integers. Specifically, if we have two successive integers, the next term must be greater than or equal to 1, leading to a contradiction. - Therefore, at most every other term can be an integer. This gives us a maximum of ( leftlfloor frac{2024}{2} rightrfloor = 1012 ) integers. 4. **Checking Feasibility of 1012 Integers:** - If we try to place 1012 integers in the sequence, we would have a pattern like (n_1, a_1, n_2, a_2, ldots, n_{1012}, a_{1012}), where (n_i) are integers and (a_i) are non-integer positive real numbers. - However, this arrangement would still lead to a strictly increasing sequence of (a_i) values, which is not possible in a circular sequence. 5. **Feasibility of 1011 Integers:** - We can place 1011 integers in the sequence such that the non-integer terms (a_i) can be chosen to prevent the sequence from becoming strictly increasing. - For example, consider the sequence: (1, frac{1}{1012^2}, 1, frac{2}{1012^2}, 1, frac{3}{1012^2}, ldots, 1, frac{1011}{1012^2}, frac{1}{1012}, frac{1011.5}{1012^3}).

What is the value of A+B?","completion":"To find the value of A+B, we need to determine the possible values of A and B that would make the six-digit number A4461B a multiple of 72. A multiple of 72 is also a multiple of both 8 and 9 (since 72 = 8 * 9), so the number must satisfy the divisibility rules for both 8 and 9. For a number to be divisible by 8, the last three digits must form a number that is divisible by 8. In this case, the last three digits are 61B. We need to find a value for B that makes 61B divisible by 8. For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. The sum of the digits in A4461B is A + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + B. Let's first find the possible values for B that make 61B divisible by 8. We can do this by checking the numbers 610, 611, 612, ..., 619 to see which are divisible by 8. - 610 ÷ 8 = 76 R 2 (not divisible) - 611 ÷ 8 = 76 R 3 (not divisible) - 612 ÷ 8 = 76 R 4 (not divisible) - 613 ÷ 8 = 76 R 5 (not divisible) - 614 ÷ 8 = 76 R 6 (not divisible) - 615 ÷ 8 = 76 R 7 (not divisible) - 616 ÷ 8 = 77 (divisible) - 617 ÷ 8 = 77 R 1 (not divisible) - 618 ÷ 8 = 77 R 2 (not divisible) - 619 ÷ 8 = 77 R 3 (not divisible) So, the only value for B that makes 61B divisible by 8 is 6. Now, let's find the possible values for A that make the sum of the digits divisible by 9. We already know that B is 6, so the sum of the digits is A + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 6. This simplifies to A + 21. For A + 21 to be divisible by 9, A must be a number such that when added to 21, the result is a multiple of 9. The smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 21 is 27, and the next is 36, then 45, and so on. Let's find the value of A by subtracting 21 from these multiples of 9: - 27 - 21 = 6 - 36 - 21 = 15 - 45 - 21 = 24 - ... The only single-digit value for A that makes A + 21 a multiple of 9 is 6 (since 6 + 21 = 27, which is a multiple of 9). Therefore, A is 6 and B is 6.

Therefore, f(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 1, which implies a > c. **Step 3: Comparing b and c** To compare b and c, we define another function h(x) = ln(1+2x) - (sqrt{1+4x} - 1), and again substitute sqrt{1+4x} = t, leading to x = frac{t^2 - 1}{4}. This gives us a new function varphi(t) = ln left(frac{t^2 + 1}{2}right) - t + 1. Differentiating varphi(t) with respect to t gives us varphi'(t) = frac{2t}{t^2 + 1} - 1, which simplifies to varphi'(t) = -frac{(t-1)^2}{t^2 + 1}. Since varphi'(t) < 0 for 1 < t < sqrt{5}, varphi(t) is monotonically decreasing in this interval. Therefore, h(x) < 0 for 0 < x < 1, which implies c > b. **Conclusion:** From the comparisons above, we have established that a > b, a > c, and c > b. Therefore, the correct order is a > c > b.

The sum revisions do not simplify into a single expression involving only a or d, and since a+d and b+c are pairs with possibly different sums for each pair of a, b, c, d, the common divisor can change based on their selection. For instance, choosing a=4, b=0, c=9, d=7, we get: abcd + dcba = 1001(4+7) + 110(0+9) = 1001 cdot 11 + 990 = 11011 + 990 = 12001. For a=3, b=1, c=8, d=6, we have: abcd+dcba = 1001(3+6) + 110(1+8) = 1001 cdot 9 + 990 = 9009 + 990 = 9999. The greatest common divisor of 12001 and 9999 would vary but typically need recalculation for different pairs of values.

The sums of all n rows and the sums of all n columns are the numbers 1, 2, ldots, 2n. For a 6 times 6 board, n = 6, so the sums of the rows and columns must be the numbers 1, 2, ldots, 12. Let's denote the elements of the board as a_{ij} where i is the row index and j is the column index. The main diagonal elements are a_{ii} for i = 1, 2, ldots, 6. Below the main diagonal, a_{ij} = 0 for i > j. The sum of all elements in the board is: [ sum_{i=1}^{6} sum_{j=1}^{6} a_{ij} ] Since the sums of the rows and columns are the numbers 1, 2, ldots, 12, the total sum of all elements in the board is: [ 1 + 2 + ldots + 12 = frac{12 cdot 13}{2} = 78 ] Each number is counted twice (once in the row sum and once in the column sum), so the total sum of the elements in the board is: [ frac{78}{2} = 39 ] To maximize the largest number on the board, we need to consider the placement of the numbers such that the sums of the rows and columns are distinct and cover the range 1, 2, ldots, 12.

The sum of these numbers is: [ 1 + 2 + ldots + 14 = frac{14 cdot 15}{2} = 105 ] Each number is counted twice (once in the row sum and once in the column sum), so the total sum of the elements in the board is: [ frac{105}{2} = 52.5 ] Since the sum of the elements in the board must be an integer, and 52.5 is not an integer, it is impossible to have an interesting board of dimensions 7 times 7.

Denote by t the length of the tangents from point M to each circle. 2. For the tangents from a common external point M to each circle, we have the following equalities based on the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the center of the circle, the point of tangency, and the point M: [ O_1M^2 = t^2 + R^2 ] [ O_2M^2 = t^2 + r^2 ] 3. Subtract the second equation from the first: [ O_1M^2 - O_2M^2 = (t^2 + R^2) - (t^2 + r^2) ] 4. Simplify the equation: [ O_1M^2 - O_2M^2 = R^2 - r^2 ] This equation indicates that the difference of the squares of the distances from M to the centers O_1 and O_2 is a constant value, specifically R^2 - r^2. 5. Recognize that a set of points that satisfy the relationship (O_1M^2 - O_2M^2) being constant is a hyperbola. However, if we take into account the perpendicular bisector of the segment (O_1O_2): This relationship also coincides geometrically with the straight line that is perpendicular to (O_1O_2) and passing through the mid-point of the line segment connecting the two circle centers. 6. Therefore, the geometric locus of points M such that tangents drawn from M to the circles are equal in length is a line perpendicular to (O_1O_2). 7.

For (x) to be an integer, (frac{k - y}{2}) must be an integer. Let this integer be (s): [ frac{k - y}{2} = s implies y = k - 2s ] Therefore, substituting (y) back, we get: [ x = - (k - 2s) + s = 3s - k ] 3.

Since the circumference of circle X is given as 14π, we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. So, we have: 14π = 2πr r = 14π / 2π r = 7 Now, since circles X and Y have the same area, they must also have the same radius. Therefore, the radius of circle Y is also 7.

The base of the triangle is on one side of the rectangle, and the vertex touches the circumference of circle Y. The altitude of the triangle will be a line from the vertex to the midpoint of the base, and it will be perpendicular to the base. Since the triangle is isosceles, the altitude also bisects the base, creating two right triangles. The altitude is the height (h) of these right triangles, and the half-base will be 'a' (since it's half the radius of circle Y). Using the Pythagorean theorem for one of the right triangles, we have: h^2 + a^2 = r^2 Substituting the values we have: h^2 + (7/2)^2 = 7^2 h^2 + 49/4 = 49 h^2 = 49 - 49/4 h^2 = (196/4) - (49/4) h^2 = 147/4 h = √(147/4) h = √(147)/2 So, the length of the altitude of the isosceles triangle in terms of 'a' is: h = √(147)/2 Since a = 7/2, we can express √(147) as 7√(3), so: h = (7√(3))/2 And since a = 7/2, we can write h in terms of 'a' as: h = a√(3) Therefore, the length of the altitude of the isosceles triangle in terms of 'a' is boxed{a√(3)} ."},{"prompt":"Let [x^8 50x^4 + 9 = p(x)q(x),] where p(x) and q(x) are monic, nonconstant polynomials with integer coefficients.

Then, the angular velocities of the minute hand and the second hand are 12w and 720w, respectively. First, consider the angle, denoted as x, at which the hour hand overlaps with the minute hand. We have the equation: frac{x}{w} = frac{x + 360n}{12w} where n is the number of times the minute hand has lapped the hour hand. The value of n ranges from 1 to 22, which is because although the minute hand completes 24 cycles in a day, the hour hand also completes 2 cycles. Thus, 24 - 2 = 22. Next, we substitute values of n to solve for x. After finding x, we need to check if the second hand is also at position x. The time it takes for the hour hand to reach position x is frac{x}{w} , and during this time, the total angle covered by the second hand is 720w times frac{x}{w} = 720x. Then, we simplify this value to see if it falls within 360 degrees and equals w. The simplification process is as follows: When n=1, x = frac{360}{11}. 720 times frac{360}{11} rightarrow 5 times frac{360}{11}. It's evident that when the hour and minute hands overlap, the second hand does not overlap with them.

The height from the ground to the point where the bamboo broke is x chi. The distance from the base of the bamboo to where the top touches the ground is 3 chi. The length of the bamboo from the ground to the break point plus the length from the break point to the top (which now touches the ground) still equals the original length of the bamboo, which is 10 chi.

The discriminant of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. For our equation, a = m, b = -(m+2), and c = 2. Calculating the discriminant: begin{align*} Delta &= (m+2)^{2} - 4 cdot m cdot 2 &= m^{2} + 4m + 4 - 8m &= m^{2} - 4m + 4 &= (m-2)^{2}. end{align*} Given that m neq 0 and m neq 2, we have (m-2)^{2} > 0. Therefore, Delta > 0, which implies that the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. This means the parabola intersects the x-axis at two points. Part (2): Finding the value of m when the x-coordinates are integers Given y = 0, we can factor the quadratic equation as follows: begin{align*} 0 &= mx^{2} - (m+2)x + 2 &= (x-1)(mx-2). end{align*} Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the roots: begin{align*} x-1 &= 0 Rightarrow x_{1} = 1, mx-2 &= 0 Rightarrow x_{2} = frac{2}{m}. end{align*} For both x_1 and x_2 to be integers, m must be a divisor of 2.

Consider the transformation: [ n - f(n) = 2n - f(2n) ] This transformation implies that if ( n - f(n) = a ) has a solution, then ( 2n - f(2n) = a ) also has a solution. This suggests that if we find one solution, we can generate infinitely many solutions. 3. **Base Case**: Let's start with the base case ( a = 1 ). We need to find ( n ) such that ( n - f(n) = 1 ). For ( n = 1 ): [ f(1) = 0 quad text{(since ( 1! = 1 ))} ] Thus, [ 1 - f(1) = 1 - 0 = 1 ] So, ( n_0 = 1 ) is a solution when ( a = 1 ). 4. **Inductive Step**: Suppose we have a solution ( b ) such that ( b - f(b) = a - 1 ) for some positive integer ( a ). We need to find ( n ) such that ( n - f(n) = a ). 5. **Finding ( n )**: Let ( k ) be the minimum number such that ( b < 2^k ). Consider ( n = 2^k + b ). We need to show that ( n - f(n) = a ): [ n = 2^k + b ] [ f(n) = f(2^k + b) ] Since ( 2^k ) is a power of 2, its contribution to ( f(n) ) is significant. We can write: [ f(2^k + b) = f(2^k) + f(b) quad text{(approximately, since ( b < 2^k ))} ] [ f(2^k) = k ] Thus, [ f(n) approx k + f(b) ] Therefore, [ n - f(n) = (2^k + b) - (k + f(b)) = 2^k + b - k - f(b) ] Since ( b - f(b) = a - 1 ), we have: [ n - f(n) = 2^k + (a - 1) - k ] For large ( k ), ( 2^k - k ) is large enough to ensure that ( n - f(n) = a ). 6. **Conclusion**: By induction, we have shown that if there is a solution for ( n - f(n) = a ), then there are infinitely many solutions. Thus, the equation ( n - f(n) = a ) has infinitely many solutions for any positive integer ( a ).

Define the movements allowed: - Forward only by an even number of cells (2, 4, 6, etc.) - Backward only by an odd number of cells (1, 3, 5, etc.) 3. Transform the idea of moving the token clockwise (forward) and counter-clockwise (backward) on the ring. - Moving backward by an odd number of cells is equivalent to moving forward by the complement to 101 cells. - For example, moving backward by 1 cell is equivalent to moving forward by ( 101 - 1 = 100 ) cells. - Moving backward by 3 cells is equivalent to moving forward by ( 101 - 3 = 98 ) cells. - This equivalence holds for all backward movements. 4. Hence, performing a backward move of any (k) odd cells corresponds to a forward move (101 - k) cells on the ring, and since (101 - k) will be even if (k) is odd, the moves remain consistent with the allowed rules. 5.

First, we note that f(x) is defined for x > 0 because of the ln x term. 2. The function y = ln x is monotonically increasing for x > 0, meaning as x increases, ln x also increases. 3. Similarly, y = -frac{1}{x} is also monotonically increasing for x > 0. This may seem counterintuitive, but as x increases, -frac{1}{x} decreases (because the negative sign makes larger values of x lead to smaller negative values), which means it moves towards 0 from the negative side. 4. Combining both, since f(x) = ln x - frac{1}{x} comprises both ln x and -frac{1}{x} which are monotonically increasing, f(x) itself is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). Now, to find where the function crosses the x-axis (i.e., f(x) = 0), we evaluate f(x) at specific points: - At x=1: f(1) = ln 1 - frac{1}{1} = 0 - 1 = -1. Thus, f(1) < 0. - At x=2: f(2) = ln 2 - frac{1}{2}. Since ln 2 > 0 and ln 2 > ln sqrt{e} = frac{1}{2} ln e = frac{1}{2}, we have ln 2 - frac{1}{2} > 0 - frac{1}{2} = -frac{1}{2}. So, f(2) > 0.

W1 = 900 grams W2 = 960 grams W3 = 980 grams R1 = 2 R2 = 3 R3 = 5 The total ratio (R) is the sum of R1, R2, and R3: R = R1 + R2 + R3 R = 2 + 3 + 5 R = 10 Now, we calculate the weighted average weight (W_avg) that the shopkeeper gives for a kilogram: W_avg = (W1*R1 + W2*R2 + W3*R3) / R W_avg = (900*2 + 960*3 + 980*5) / 10 Calculating the weighted average: W_avg = (1800 + 2880 + 4900) / 10 W_avg = 9580 / 10 W_avg = 958 grams The shopkeeper should be giving 1000 grams for a kilogram, but on average, he gives 958 grams. This means he is giving less by: 1000 - 958 = 42 grams The profit made by the shopkeeper for every kilogram is 42 grams. To find the profit percentage, we calculate the ratio of the profit to the actual weight given and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: Profit percentage = (Profit / Actual weight given) * 100 Profit percentage = (42 / 958) * 100 Calculating the profit percentage: Profit percentage ≈ (42 / 958) * 100 Profit percentage ≈ 0.0438413361 * 100 Profit percentage ≈ 4.38413361 Therefore, the overall profit percentage of the shopkeeper using the weighted average approach is approximately boxed{4.38%} ."},{"prompt":"What quadrant does the angle frac{2pi}{3} belong to?

From the information given, we know that Ralph watches TV for x hours each day from Monday to Friday, which is a total of 5 days. So the total hours he watches TV from Monday to Friday is 5x. We also know that Ralph watches TV for 6 hours each on Saturday and Sunday. So for the weekend, he watches a total of 6 hours/day * 2 days = 12 hours. The total hours Ralph watches TV in one week is the sum of the hours he watches from Monday to Friday and the hours he watches on the weekend. According to the information given, this total is 32 hours. So we have the equation: 5x (hours from Monday to Friday) + 12 hours (weekend) = 32 hours (total weekly hours) Now we can solve for x: 5x + 12 = 32 Subtract 12 from both sides: 5x = 32 - 12 5x = 20 Now, divide both sides by 5: x = 20 / 5 x = 4 Therefore, Ralph watches TV for boxed{4} hours each day from Monday to Friday."},{"prompt":"Let p and q be the two distinct solutions to the equation (x6)(3x+8) = x^2 15x + 54.

The tangents to the circumcircle of (ABC) at (B) and (C) intersect at point (P). We need to prove that line (AP) contains the symmedian (AS).

Understanding that this theorem directly applies, we move forward with our proof. Step 2: Define symmedian The symmedian of a triangle is a line passing through one vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side. It is the isogonal conjugate of the median. For triangle (ABC), the symmedian through vertex (A) (denoted as (AS)) reflects the corresponding sides at (A). By problem 3.30, we know: 1. The tangents to the circumcircle of a triangle at vertices (B) and (C) intersect at point (P). 2. This point of intersection lies on the symmedian from vertex (A). Step 3: Apply the theorem to the given problem Given that P is the intersection of the tangents to the circumcircle at (B) and (C), by the theorem mentioned, line (AP) must contain the symmedian (AS) of triangle (ABC).

Therefore, we can express set M as: [M = {x | 0 < x < 3}] **Step 2: Solve for set N** Given N={x||x-1| < 2}, we can break this into two cases based on the absolute value condition: 1.

Step 2: **Case 1 - Line passes through the origin:** In this scenario, the equation of the line could be of the form y=mx, where m is the slope. Because it passes through A(1,4), we can determine the slope as m = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{4-0}{1-0} = 4. Thus, the equation becomes y=4x, which can be rearranged to 4x-y=0. Step 3: **Case 2 - Line does not pass through the origin:** Let the intercepts be x=a and y=-a (since their sum is zero, one intercept should be the negative of the other). The general equation of such a line is frac{x}{a}+frac{y}{-a}=1. Given that the line passes through point A(1,4), substituting these values gives frac{1}{a}+frac{4}{-a}=1.

The slope of line AB is calculated as follows: [k_{AB} = frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = frac{2 - 4}{3 - 1} = frac{-2}{2} = -1] Since line l is parallel to AB and passes through point C(2,-1), the equation of line l can be derived from the slope-point form of a line equation, which is y - y_1 = m(x - x_1). However, knowing that the slope is -1, we can directly infer that the line has a slope-intercept form of y = -x + b.

A cube has 6 faces, and the area of each face is the square of the length of its side. The length of each side of the cube is given as 30 feet. So, the area of one face of the cube is: Area of one face = side × side = 30 ft × 30 ft = 900 sq. ft.

Then, Oleg writes the sum of the number to the left of the row and the number above the column in each cell of the grid (creating an addition table). What is the maximum number of rational numbers that can appear in this grid?","completion":"# Problem: Consider a (50 times 50) grid, where each row has a real number written to the left of it, and each column has a real number written above it (outside the grid). There are 100 real numbers in total, 50 of which are rational and 50 of which are irrational. The numbers in each cell of the grid are the sum of the number to the left of that row and the number above that column. The task is to determine the maximum number of rational numbers that can appear in the grid. 1. We denote (x) as the number of rational numbers written to the left of the rows. Consequently, (50 - x) will be the number of irrational numbers written to the left of the rows. 2. Similarly, the number of rational numbers written above the columns is (x), and the number of irrational numbers written above the columns is (50 - x). 3. For a cell in the grid, the sum of the numbers from the row and column can either be rational or irrational. This depends on whether both contributing numbers are rational or both are irrational. Specifically: - The sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational. - The sum of a rational number and another rational number is rational. - The sum of an irrational number and another irrational number can be rational or irrational but we will consider they are irrational as a necessary simplification for this context. 4. Therefore, we can compute the number of irrational sums by considering: - (x^2) as the number of sums where both addends are rational. - ((50 - x)^2) as the number of sums where both addends are irrational. 5. The total number of irrational sums ((N_i)) in the grid is given by: [ N_i = x^2 + (50 - x)^2 ] 6. Simplify the expression for (N_i): [ N_i = x^2 + (50 - x)^2 = x^2 + 2500 - 100x + x^2 = 2x^2 - 100x + 2500 ] 7. We need the minimum number of irrational numbers because the complement will give us the maximum number of rational numbers. Since (2x^2 - 100x + 2500) is a quadratic equation, we find its minimum value by completing the square or by using the vertex form. The minimum value occurs at: [ x = frac{-b}{2a} = frac{100}{2 times 2} = 25 ] Substitute (x = 25): [ N_i = 2 times 25^2 - 100 times 25 + 2500 = 2 times 625 - 2500 + 2500 = 1250 ] 8. Therefore, the minimum number of irrational numbers in the grid is 1250, which implies the maximum number of rational numbers is: [ 50^2 - 1250 = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 ] 9. To confirm that this is possible, consider filling the left and upper labels of the grid as follows: - For the left side: (1, 2, ldots, 25, 1 + sqrt{2}, 2 + sqrt{2}, ldots, 25 + sqrt{2}) - For the top side: (-1, -2, ldots, -25, 1 - sqrt{2}, 2 - sqrt{2}, ldots, 25 - sqrt{2}) Each rational row label combined with each rational column label forms a rational number. Similarly, each irrational row label combined with each irrational column label often forms another irrational number. This setup will result in exactly 1250 rational numbers in the grid.

Weight with magical bracer: 2800 pounds To find the percentage increase due to the magical bracer, we need to calculate the difference between the weight he could lift after training and the weight he can lift with the bracer, and then divide that by the weight he could lift after training. Difference due to bracer: 2800 pounds - 400 pounds = 2400 pounds Now, we calculate the percentage increase: Percentage increase = (Difference due to bracer / Weight after training) * 100 Percentage increase = (2400 pounds / 400 pounds) * 100 Percentage increase = 6 * 100 Percentage increase = 600% So, the magical bracer increased John's strength by boxed{600%} ."},{"prompt":"An investor placed 15,000 in a ninemonth deposit that earned a simple annual interest rate of 8%.

First, let's convert the flow rate from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per minute (m/min). There are 1000 meters in a kilometer and 60 minutes in an hour, so: Flow rate = 4 kmph * (1000 m/km) / (60 min/h) = 4000 m/60 min = 66.67 m/min Now, we know the amount of water that runs into the sea per minute is 6000 cubic meters. This volume is the product of the cross-sectional area of the river (width * depth) and the distance the water travels per minute (flow rate). Volume per minute = Width * Depth * Flow rate We can rearrange this formula to solve for the depth: Depth = Volume per minute / (Width * Flow rate) Plugging in the values we have: Depth = 6000 m³/min / (45 m * 66.67 m/min) = 6000 m³/min / 3000.15 m²/min Depth ≈ 2 m Therefore, the depth of the river is approximately boxed{2} meters."},{"prompt":"Find the curve defined by the equation [ r = 3costheta. ] (A) Line (B) Circle (C) Parabola (D) Ellipse (E) Hyperbola Enter the letter of the correct option.","completion":"The equation ( r = 3costheta ) is a polar equation.

Conclusion: While the moral guilt is shared by both A and B, from a strict causality perspective, B's action of making the hole in the water bag directly led to C's death from thirst. Therefore, B's action was the immediate cause of death. [ boxed{B} ]"},{"prompt":"Rectangle LMNO has LM=7 and MN=3.

Equation: y - 3 = -frac{1}{7}(x - 0), simplifies to y = -frac{1}{7}x + 3. - **Line LQ**: Slope of LQ is frac{0-3}{4-0} = -frac{3}{4}.

Let u represent the number of golden cells within such a 2 times 2 square. 2. **Counting in 3×3 Squares**: Each 3 times 3 square must contain exactly A golden cells. Now, note that within this configuration, every 3 times 3 square is composed of overlapping 2 times 2 squares. 3. **Counting in 2×4 and 4×2 Rectangles**: Similarly, every 2 times 4 or 4 times 2 rectangle must contain exactly Z golden cells. 4. **Relation Between Adjacent 2×2 Squares**: Considering adjacent 2 times 2 squares, if one has u golden cells, then the adjacent one must have v = Z - u golden cells because the shared side of 2 times 4 or 4 times 2 rectangles essentially integrates these squares' values. Therefore, our board consists of alternating neighbors (u, v) in a checkerboard pattern. 5. **Analysis with Larger Square Segments**: Consider a larger 6 times 6 section of the board, which can be divided into nine 2 times 2 squares. If we represent u cells in one 2 times 2, then, due to checkerboard property, adjacent 2 times 2 squares will have v = Z - u and vice versa. 6. **Counting Golden Cells in a 6×6 Square**: The 6 times 6 square is composed of four overlapping 3 times 3 squares, thus totally containing 4A golden cells. By counting: - If the 6 times 6 square is filled such that alternating squares have u and v, then the total number of golden cells is given by (4u + 5v) or (5u + 4v) because each pattern arrangement has to sum to a multiple sequence. - Hence, equating both gives 4u + 5(Z - u) = 5u + 4(Z - u), which simplifies to (u = v). 7. **Conclusion from Uniformity**: Since (u = v), it follows (u = v = frac{Z}{2}), matching constraints for perfect blending. 8. **Solving (u) and (A)**: We have 9u = 4A.

Let us first consider the given parallelogram ABCD, where AM is the angle bisector of angle LAN. Therefore, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, the segments LM and MN must be equal as they are chords subtending equal arcs. This equality is established in the cyclic quadrilateral ALMN. 2. Our goal is to prove that angle CNL = 90^circ. 3. Observe that since AM bisects angle LAN, it follows that triangle ABK is isosceles, with AK = BK. Moreover, the given condition AL = CK implies that ABK is symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of AK. 4. Designate point X on BK such that LX parallel AK. By symmetry of triangle ABK, we have KX = AL. Hence, KX = CK and MK parallel LX. 5. Now, because MK parallel LX, MK is the midline in triangle CLX. Therefore, we have CM = LM. 6. The resulting conclusion is that CM = LM = MN, indicating that triangle CML is an isosceles triangle. Also, since M lies on both the angle bisector AD and the segment AK, and given that M lies on the perpendicular bisector of CX, the segment CM must be perpendicular to LN. 7. Knowing that DM is the angle bisector of angle ADC, and M divides angle ADC into two equal angles (90^circ - alpha), it implies angle MDC = 90^circ - alpha, where alpha is half the measure of angle ADK. 8.

Specifically, we've assumed that ( n(100 - n) leq 98 ) (as the total number of vertices in the graph multiply maximum of edges created by vertex lesser than total edges of rest). As we see, the actual minimum value asserts that the number of edges missing in the graph (99) is greater than our capacity (98).

It can be described as follows: - The cross has a central square and one square extending from each side of the central square (top, bottom, left, and right). 3. **Area Calculation:** - Each of the five squares has an area of (1) square unit. - Therefore, the total area of the cross is (5) square units. - Since we are required to divide the cross into three polygons (polygons A, B, and C) of equal area, each polygon must have an area of (frac{5}{3} approx 1.67) square units. 4. **Perimeter Calculation:** - The initial perimeter of the cross can be calculated. Each square has 4 sides. However, due to overlaps, we must carefully count the shared boundaries between squares. - The correct methodology is to realize that the outer boundary forms the perimeter, and internal boundaries are not counted. - Draw the diagram by considering external vertices and edges. This setup helps ensure we've visualized and counted the perimeter correctly. 5. **Logical Division:** - Begin by trying possible ways to divide the cross into three regions directly starting at the central square and dividing lines such that each region covers parts of different squares. - It's often helpful to start by thinking about intuitive symmetry and balance. - Given the criteria (equal area and equal perimeter), the solution should end up looking like three arms of almost equal length and containing at least part of the central square. 6. **Possible Solutions:** - Since one solution would be much easier to depict visually (via image), consider showing one or more possible divisions. - Note: This typically includes ensuring that the regions touch the central square and spread towards the arms of the cross. 7. **Diagram Reference:** Providing one concrete division: - (See the diagram in the text reference.) This involves drawing lines in specific ways to ensure three equally split areas, adhering to the symmetry of the cross structure. Conclusion: - **Visual Solutions Verification:** - Use the actual diagram referenced (or draw the same visually) to ensure that each region has the correct area of approximately (1.67) (or (frac{5}{3})) square units. - Ensure each resulting polygon's perimeter can be measured to ensure it matches the others, verifying by repeating perimeter checks around the visually obtained regions.

We need to prove that: [ n_1^2 - n_2^2 + n_3^2 - n_4^2 + ldots + n_k^2 geq 2k^2 - 1 ] 3. Let ( S ) denote the sum: [ S = n_1^2 - n_2^2 + n_3^2 - n_4^2 + ldots + n_k^2 ] 4.

Thus, we can express it as: [ overline{abbbb} = 10000a + 1000b + 100b + 10b + b = 10000a + 1111b ] 2. **Condition to Satisfy:** We are given that (overline{abbbb})^{2} - 1 is a ten-digit number and that within this 10-digit result, the digits are all different. This key constraint drives us to look for values of a and b such that the squared number is at least a 10-digit number but not more than 10 digits. 3. **Equation and Digit Count Analysis:** Consider the square of overline{abbbb}: [ (10000a + 1111b)^2 - 1 ] For this expression to be a ten-digit number, [ (10000a + 1111b)^2 approx 10^{10} ] This implies: [ 10000a + 1111b approx sqrt{10^{10}} = 10^5 ] Therefore, [ 10000a + 1111b approx 100000 ] 4. **Finding Specific Values:** We simplify the problem by testing potential values for a and b.

(If multiple segments lie on the same straight line, they count as one.)","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a state with 500 cities, each city in the shape of a regular 37-pointed star with towers at each vertex. The goal is to build a convex wall around these towers such that each segment of the wall connects two towers. We need to prove that the wall will consist of at least 37 segments. 2. **Insight Into Regular 37-Pointed Star:** A regular 37-pointed star can be thought of as a polygon with 37 vertices. The key property here is that each vertex is a point from which segments can be drawn. 3. **Convex Hull Concept:** A convex hull of a set of points is the smallest convex polygon that can contain all the points inside it or on its boundary. For our problem, we need to enclose the towers in this convex manner. 4. **Application of Convex Hull:** To create a convex hull of all the 500 cities, each with 37 towers, we focus on the fact that the vertices form the boundary of the convex hull. Since each city is a 37-pointed star with towers at these vertices, these vertices will contribute to the convex hull. 5. **Durstenfeld/Cormen Theorem on Convex Hull Vertices:** It is known that the convex hull of a set of ( n ) vertices can be found and the number of vertices is minimized by the boundary points. In particular, for our 37-pointed star, the convex hull will have at least the majority of these vertices. 6. **Combining Cities:** When creating the convex hull around all the 500 cities, we consider that each city's vertices might align or connect on the convex hull. Nonetheless, regardless of the positioning of the cities, the primary shape formed by these points (towers) will still involve at least 37 vertices from the points. 7. **Conclusion by Containment in a Polygon:** Since each individual city's star is complex and any alignment won't reduce the star's vertices contributing to the boundary of the convex hull, the minimal number of segments required to form the convex wall will be equal to the number of vertices forming the smallest convex polygon containing the stars. 8. **Final Mathematical Statement:** Since our problem involves merging convex boundaries with one another, we conclude that any such valid convex hull will consist of at least 37 segments. This adheres to the geometry of combining regular polygon shapes. Therefore, the wall will consist of at least: [ boxed{37} ] segments."},{"prompt":"A certain electronic toy displays either a red or a green ball after a button is pressed.

Therefore, the total sales for these 11 months would be 11A. The sales total for December was 2 times the average of these months, so the sales for December is 2A. The total sales for the year would be the sum of the sales for January through November and the sales for December, which is 11A + 2A = 13A. To find the fraction of the sales total for the year that was the sales total for December, we divide the sales for December by the total sales for the year: Fraction for December = Sales for December / Total sales for the year Fraction for December = 2A / 13A The A's cancel out, so we are left with: Fraction for December = 2 / 13 Therefore, the sales total for December was boxed{2/13} of the sales total for the year."},{"prompt":"Find the integer solutions to the system of equations (left{begin{array}{l}x z 2 y t = 3, x t + y z = 1 .end{array}right.).","completion":"1.

From these, we have the system of equations: [ left{ begin{array}{l} x = y + 20 5x = 6y end{array} right. ] Substituting x = y + 20 into 5x = 6y, we get: [ 5(y + 20) = 6y implies 5y + 100 = 6y implies y = 100 ] Substituting y = 100 into x = y + 20, we get: [ x = 100 + 20 = 120 ] Therefore, the cost price of each unit of type A is boxed{120}, and the cost price of each unit of type B is boxed{100}. Part 2: Calculating the Total Profit Let m be the number of units of type A purchased, then (80 - m) is the number of units of type B purchased. Given that the total cost for purchasing these units is 9000, we have: [ 120m + 100(80 - m) = 9000 ] Solving for m: [ 120m + 8000 - 100m = 9000 implies 20m = 1000 implies m = 50 ] Thus, 80 - m = 80 - 50 = 30. For type A, after increasing the cost price by 50% and offering a 20% discount on the selling price, the profit per unit is: [ 120 times (1 + 50%) times 0.8 - 120 = 96 - 120 = -24 ] However, the calculation seems to have been misunderstood in the original solution. The correct calculation for profit from type A should consider the increased price and then the discount, not directly subtracting the original cost from the discounted price. Let's correct this: The selling price of type A after a 50% increase and a 20% discount is: [ 120 times 1.5 times 0.8 = 144 ] The profit per unit for type A is: [ 144 - 120 = 24 ] Total profit from selling type A: [ 24 times 50 = 1200 ] For type B, with a profit of 30 per unit, the total profit is: [ 30 times 30 = 900 ] Therefore, the total profit after selling all units of type A and type B is: [ 1200 + 900 = 2100 ] The total profit after selling all units of type A and type B is boxed{2100}."},{"prompt":"Laura wants to bake a cake for her mother.

That means there were 4 slices left for the dog to eat. If the total cost of the cake is 9, then each slice costs 9 / 6 = 1.5 The dog ate 4 slices, so the cost of what the dog ate is 4 slices * 1.5 per slice = 6 Since the cost of what the dog ate is 6, and we know that the total cost of the cake is 9, we can confirm that the calculation is correct. Now, to find out how many cups of flour Laura needs to buy, we need to look at the cost of the flour, which is boxed{4} .

Note that two angles are equal, hence it is an isosceles triangle. 2. **Determine the Required Missing Angle:** We seek to draw an equilateral triangle, which has internal angles of 60^circ each. 3. **Understanding the Angle Construction:** Notice that 40^circ times 3 = 120^circ, which is critical in forming a specific construction for additional angles. Moreover, 180^circ - 120^circ = 60^circ. This suggests our possibility to make increments and sums of 40^circ and 70^circ which help in constructing 60^circ. 4. **Positioning the Triangle:** By tracing the triangle three times as demonstrated in the image: ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_30cae7e546dcde2db7c2g-2.jpg?height=505&width=1311&top_left_y=604&top_left_x=378) **Steps are as follows:** - Place the given triangle on the paper such that one 70^circ angle is on the baseline and trace its outline. - Repeat tracing the triangle twice more, keeping the adjacent triangles sharing only these 70^circ sides: Position (1) to Position (3). As a result, the triangle which forms has the angles forming an internal 120^circ at the intersections points. 5. **Reposition the Triangle:** Align the previously constructed shapes where supplementary angles ((120^circ)) can provide the final desired angle: Place the triangle in Position (4) making 60^circ. One (70^circ) still lies on the 120^circ intersection counterpart. 6. **Construct the Equilateral Triangle Formation:** - One of the steps involves finding an intersection that directly results in 60^circ which helps forming an equilateral triangle. - To finalize the equilateral triangle by connecting through already drawn sides matching 60^circ vertices, ensuring sides are equal, maintain that the wooden triangle is positioned and keep traced such that one side (regardless of length) lies on an already drawn existing segment.

For x in (-1, 1), let's choose a test point, say x = 0: f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 3 = 3 > 0, which means the function is increasing in the interval (-1, 1). For x in (1, infty), let's choose a test point, say x = 2: f'(2) = -3(2)^2 + 3 = -12 + 3 = -9 < 0, indicating the function is decreasing in the interval (1, infty). Hence, the function has a maximum at x = 1 and a minimum at x = -1. Calculating the values at these points: For the maximum value: f(1) = -1^3 + 3 cdot 1 - 1 = -1 + 3 - 1 = boxed{1}. For the minimum value: f(-1) = -(-1)^3 + 3 cdot (-1) - 1 = -1 - 3 - 1 = boxed{-5}. However, there seems to be an error in the solution as the calculated minimum value does not match any of the options provided. Let's double-check our calculation: f(-1) = -(-1)^3 + 3(-1) - 1 = 1 - 3 - 1 = -3.

We are given an isosceles triangle triangle ABC where AB = AC. There is a circle odot O that is inscribed within triangle ABC. Let the points of tangency of odot O with sides BC, CA, and AB be K, L, and M respectively. Let N be the intersection of lines OL and KM. Let Q be the intersection of lines BN and CA. Let P be the foot of the perpendicular from point A to line BQ. It is given that BP = AP + 2PQ. We are to find all possible values of frac{AB}{BC}. 1. **Prove that Q is the midpoint of line segment AC.** Let's consider the following observations and constructions: - Since M, K, L are points of tangency, we have angle ALO = angle OM_1M, angle M_1NO = 90^circ, and angle OMN = 90^{circ}. Therefore, quadrilateral MM_1NO is cyclic, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem. Thus, angle MNM_1 = angle MOM_1. - Since angle OKK = angle ONK = 90^circ, quadrilateral ONKK_1 is also cyclic. Thus, angle KOK_1 = angle KNK_1. As triangle OMM_1 cong triangle OKK_1 by ASA congruence, we obtain OM_1 = OK_1. - Hence triangle OM_1K_1 is isosceles. Since angle M_1NO = 90^circ, N is the midpoint of M_1K_1, so M_1K_1 parallel AC. Consequently, Q is the midpoint of AC. 2. **Consider the point P inside triangle ABC.** Let R be the foot of the perpendicular from C to BQ. Then triangle APQ cong triangle CRQ are right and congruent triangles. Hence PQ = QR and AP = CR. Assume BP = PR + CR. On line BQ, let S be such that CR = RS. Then BP - PS = CR = AP, as AP perp BQ. Thus, A is the circumcenter of triangle BSC. Using the angle relations in cyclic quadrilateral and symmetry properties: angle BAC = 2angle BSC = 90^circ. Thus, triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle, leading to: frac{AB}{BC} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} 3. **Consider point P outside triangle ABC.** Suppose on line segment BQ we have point T such that QP = PT. Since triangle APQ cong triangle CRQ cong triangle APT, we have CR = AP. Given BP = BR + 2PQ, and BP = AP + 2PQ implies AP = BR.

The triangle BAB' is equilateral. Here’s the reasoning: - Since B' is symmetric to B with respect to AM, AB = AB'. - By the problem condition, AB = BC. Therefore, AB = AB' = BC. - angle BAM = 30^circ which means angle B'AM = 30^circ as well. Thus, angle BAB' = 60^circ. Because triangle BAB' is isosceles with AB = AB' and one angle being 60^circ, it must be equilateral. 3. Thus, triangle BAB' has all sides equal, and all angles, angle A, angle B, and angle B', equal to 60^circ. 4. Given that AB = BC and both B and B' are symmetric relative to the line AM, triangles BAM and B'AM are congruent. 5. As a result, the angles angle BAM and angle B'MA are equal to 30^circ each, and hence angle BAC = 180^circ - (30^circ + 30^circ) = 120^circ. 6. If we denote angle MAC by alpha, i.e., angle MAC = alpha, then angle BAM = 30^circ and thus angle B'AC = 30^circ. Since angle ACM = 150^circ, we have angle MAC = 150^circ - 120^circ = 30^circ implying alpha = 30^circ. 7. As B and B' are symmetric relative to AM, angle B'MC = angle BAC. This means angle BMC = 2alpha. 8. Now observe the triangles ABM and BMC where, angle ABM = 30^circ + alpha and angle AMC = 150^circ. 9.

We are given that when A and B are used to pump out water from the half-full tank, while C is used to fill the tank, the tank will be empty in 0.75 hours. This means that the combined rate of A and B minus the rate of C equals the rate at which the tank is emptied from half-full to empty in 0.75 hours.

Approach 2: Quadrangle Consideration 1. **Analyzing the Quadrangle**: - Consider the four points forming a quadrangle (ABCD). 2. **Case 1: Non-Convex Quadrilateral**: - If the quadrilateral is non-convex, then one of the points lies inside the triangle formed by the other three points (Figure 6). - The circumcircle of this triangle will cover the three points on its circumference with the fourth point either inside or on this circumference. 3. **Case 2: Convex Quadrilateral**: - Assume the quadrilateral (ABCD) is convex. By convexity, there exists a pair of opposite angles whose sum is at least (180^circ). Assume these angles are (angle B) and (angle D) (Figure 7). 4. **Circumcircle Argument**: - Consider the circumcircle of triangle (ABC) with center (O). - Draw a ray from (O) through point (D) and let it intersect the circumcircle at (D'). 5. **Angle Sum Consideration**: - Since (angle B + angle D' = 180^circ) and (angle B + angle D geq 180^circ), it follows that (D) cannot lie outside the circumcircle. - Therefore, (D) must be either inside or on the circumference of the circumcircle of (triangle ABC).

This specific circle is known as the **Euler Circle** (or Nine-Point Circle). The properties of this circle will be pivotal in deriving the solution. 2. **Initial Setup and Proposition:** We will use a proof by contradiction to demonstrate that if the orthocenter (H) lies on the Euler Circle, then triangle (ABC) must be a right triangle. Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that triangle (ABC) is **not** a right triangle. 3. **Euler Circle Background:** Recall the definition and properties of the Euler Circle: - The Euler Circle of a triangle passes through nine significant points associated with the triangle: the midpoints of its sides, the feet of the altitudes, and the midpoints of the segments connecting each vertex to the orthocenter. 4. **Contradiction Setup:** Under our assumption, since (H) lies on the Euler Circle, a critical step to the proof includes recognizing the relationship of lengths involving the orthocenter (H) and the circumcenter (O) (the center of the circumscribed circle of (ABC)). 5. **Key Property of the Euler Circle:** One crucial aspect of triangle geometry involving the Euler Circle and the distances between key points is the well-known **distance formula between orthocenter and circumcenter**: [ OH^2 = R^2 - 4R^2 cos^2(A + B - C) ] Here (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle (ABC). 6. **Using Cosines to Illustrate Contradiction:** This formula indicates an intricate link between the distances and the angle measures in the triangle. A pivotal detail is that: - The Euler Line contains the circumcenter (O), centroid (G), and orthocenter (H), and is such that (HG = 2GO). Additionally, if (H) lies on the Euler Circle, an important property is invoked: [ OH^2 = R^2 / 4 ] This is directly derived from the orthic triangle (formed by feet of perpendiculars). 7. **Orthic Triangle Analysis:** Next, we examine properties of the orthic triangle in a non-right triangle scenario: - The triangle's centroid (G) splits the median in a 2:1 ratio. - In the context of the Euler Circle, the location of (H) on the nine-point circle is very special. 8. **Deriving Contradiction:** Suppose (ABC) is not a right triangle; then the positions of (H) contradict properties required for the nine-point circle’s existence around point (H) in such a scenario. According to classic triangle properties, if (H) were to sit precisely on the Euler Circle, this specific geometrical configuration directly leads us to a conclusion that can only be possible when: 9. **Conclusion:** This contradiction affirms the assumption must be false.

Multiply by the interval width (in this case, 5mm): 0.6 times 5 = 3. 4. Multiply by the number of fibers: 3 times 100 = 300. However, the given calculation seems to have a mistake since the correct calculation should have the decimal frequency multiplied by the total number of samples (100), not again by 5.

The interest earned at the original rate R% for 4 years is: Interest = (P * R * 4) / 100 The interest earned at the higher rate (R + 3)% for 4 years is: Interest = (P * (R + 3) * 4) / 100 The difference between the two interests is Rs. 120, so we can set up the following equation: (P * (R + 3) * 4) / 100 - (P * R * 4) / 100 = 120 Simplifying the equation, we get: (4P * (R + 3)) / 100 - (4P * R) / 100 = 120 (4PR + 12P) / 100 - (4PR) / 100 = 120 (12P) / 100 = 120 12P = 120 * 100 12P = 12000 Now, we can solve for P: P = 12000 / 12 P = 1000 Therefore, the sum that was put at simple interest is Rs. boxed{1000} ."},{"prompt":"Prove that if (a, b, c, d) are integers and (a+b+c+d=0), then (2left(a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}+d^{4}right)+8abcd) is a perfect square.","completion":"1.

Consequently, we only focus on the squares of odd numbers. 2. **Odd Numbers:** - Let us express a multi-digit perfect square of an odd number. Any odd number can be written as (10a + b), where (b) is the last digit and (a geq 1). For the product of two odd numbers, the resulting number has an odd digit as its last digit (b). 3. **Square Expression:** - The square of ((10a + b)) can be expanded as: [ (10a + b)^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2 ] Here (100a^2) and (20ab) terms will contribute to the higher places of the number, specifically tens, hundreds, and so on.

The number formed by (20ab) always ends in zero, making its ten's place always even. 6. **Summation of Terms:** - Combining these results: [ (10a + b)^2 = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2 ] Both (100a^2) and (20ab) have their tens and higher digits even while (b^2) determines the unit digit based on (b). Since (20ab) contributes a term that makes the tens digit always even (which itself cannot be odd). **Conclusion:** Any multi-digit perfect square must have at least one even digit due to the structure of polynomial squares.

Each die has 6 faces, so for one die, there are 6 possible outcomes. When throwing five dice, the total number of possible outcomes is the product of the possible outcomes for each die: Total possible outcomes = 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 6^5 = 7776 Now, let's consider the favorable outcomes.

The difference between the two remainders when divided by 125 and D is 40 - 11 = 29. This suggests that D could be a factor of 29 since 29 is the difference that needs to be accounted for to go from a remainder of 40 to a remainder of 11.

If ( A ) does not mark the single cell, ( B ) places the first and only coin, guaranteeing ( B ) wins. Hence, the base case holds as ( A ) must necessarily mark one cell. - **Inductive Step: Suppose the hypothesis holds for ( n=k ):** - In a (2k+1) times (2k+1) grid, if ( A ) marks fewer than 2k+1 cells, ( B ) has a winning strategy. - Now, consider ( n=k+1 ). ( A ) marks at most 2k+2 cells: - If two marked cells share the same row or column, ( B ) can place a coin in that specific row or column. - If no two marked cells lie in the same row or column, consider cells ((i,j)) and ((s,t)) marked by ( A ). ( B ) can place a coin in cell ((i,t)). 4. **Concluding Scenario if Fewer than ( 2n+1 ) Cells Marked:** - ( B ) will have a relentless strategy to always block ( A )'s moves by leveraging the positioning of unmarked cells. - By inductive reasoning, it infers that if ( A ) marks fewer than ( 2n+1 ) cells, ( B ) has a winning strategy by exploiting rows and columns. 5. **Applying Conclusion to the Original ( 25 times 25 ) Board:** - Given ( 25 = 2n+1 ), we obtain ( n = 12 ).

The sum of the cookies eaten by her father, mother, and brother is equal to the total number of cookies eaten by the family: F + (F/2) + (F/2 + 2) = 22 Combining the terms with F, we get: F + F/2 + F/2 = 22 - 2 2F/2 + F/2 + F/2 = 20 2F/2 is just F, so we have: F + F + F = 20 3F = 20 Now, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for F: F = 20 / 3 F = 6.666...

The speeds of all the balls are the same. When any two balls collide, they rebound in opposite directions with the same speed they had before the collision. How many collisions will occur in total between the balls?","completion":"1. **Setting Up the Problem:** - We have two sets of 5 identical balls each. - The balls in one set move from left to right. - The balls in the other set move from right to left. - All balls have the same constant speed. 2. **Behavior Upon Collision:** - When any two balls collide, they continue to move with the same speed, but in opposite directions. - This collision behavior implies that after collision, the balls can be considered to have simply passed through each other without changing their speeds or directions. This symmetry helps in simplifying the analysis. 3. **Counting the Collisions:** - Consider a single ball moving from left to right. This ball will meet every single ball moving from right to left at least once because they are all moving directly toward each other. - Therefore, each ball from the left encounters each ball from the right. 4. **Total Collisions Calculation:** - There are 5 balls moving from left to right. - Each of these 5 balls will collide with every one of the 5 balls moving from right to left. - Hence, the number of collisions is calculated by multiplying the number of left-moving balls by the number of right-moving balls: [ text{Total Collisions} = 5 times 5 = 25. ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{25} ] This counts every unique collision between the balls."},{"prompt":"David did 44 pushups in gym class today.

The ants keep walking indefinitely. Assuming that the total number of collisions is finite, determine the largest possible number of collisions in terms of ( n ).","completion":"To determine the largest possible number of collisions for n ants, we begin by showing that the upper bound on the number of collisions is frac{n(n-1)}{2}. Next, we construct an example demonstrating that this bound can indeed be attained. 1. **Upper Bound Proof:** Consider n ants labeled A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n. Each ant is moving either to the left or the right, with their respective speeds being nonzero. Suppose we track the movements of these ants. Each pair of ants can collide at most once. To see why, consider any two ants A_i and A_j: - After they collide, they change directions. - If they collide a second time, since they change directions again, they would now be heading in different directions, thus preventing further collisions between the same pair. Therefore, if we count the maximum number of unique pairs of ants that might collide: [text{Number of unique pairs} = binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2}.] This establishes the upper bound on the number of possible collisions. 2. **Achieving the Upper Bound:** Now we need to verify that the upper bound frac{n(n-1)}{2} collisions can be achieved with an appropriate example. We construct our example inductively: - **Base Case (n = 1):** There is only one ant, so no collisions can occur. The number of collisions is 0, which agrees with the formula frac{1(1-1)}{2} = 0. - **Inductive Step:** Assume that for n-1 ants, the maximum number of collisions is frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}. Now add a new ant, A_1, to the leftmost position such that its speed is higher than any other ant. Let the speeds of the ants decrease from left to right. - Since A_1 is moving faster than all other ants and to the right, it will collide with each of ants 2, 3, ldots, n sequentially. - Each collision changes the direction of the colliding ants, and because A_1 is faster, each subsequent ant A_2, A_3, ldots, A_n will similarly experience one collision. - This new configuration results in the following sequence of collisions: first among the original (n-1) ants, and then further collisions as A_1 meets each ant from the slower leftward ants. Thus, the total number of collisions now includes: [ text{Collisions among the original } (n-1) text{ ants which is } frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}text{, plus} ] [ (n-1) text{ new collisions involving the new fast ant } A_1. ] Therefore, the total number of collisions is: [ frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + (n-1) = frac{(n-1)(n-2) + 2(n-1)}{2} = frac{(n-1)[(n-2) + 2]}{2} = frac{(n-1)(n)}{2}. ] By induction, we conclude that for any number of ants n, the largest possible number of collisions is frac{n(n-1)}{2}. **Conclusion:** Hence, the largest possible number of collisions for n ants is given by: [ boxed{frac{n(n-1)}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Rich likes to take long walks through town.

To proceed with the method of contradiction, we must first negate the conclusion of the original proposition. This means that we must write the negation of the statement “at least one of b and c is even”. The negation of this statement is that both b and c are odd. A rational root implies, by the Rational Root Theorem, that if p/q is a root (in its simplest form), then p is a factor of c and q is a factor of a. If c is odd, p must also be odd (since an even number cannot be a factor of an odd number). Similarly, if b and c were both odd, for ax^2 + bx + c to be zero with an x = p/q where p and q are integers, a must also be even to ensure the coefficient bx (when b is odd) remains even, to add up to a potentially even c. Therefore, option A is incorrect, as both b and c being even does not involve contradiction. Option B is the correct assumption for contradiction.

When a person comes into contact with the ground, the person's speed decreases to zero. According to the momentum theorem, we have (F - mg)t = Delta mv. By landing on tiptoe, the time of contact with the ground can be increased, which reduces the impact force according to the formula, not the impulse of the ground on the person. Hence, A is incorrect. B. When transporting glass, it is necessary to fill it with foam to reduce the impact force during the vibration process. Hence, B is correct. C. During the process of pulling out the paper strip, the cup moves in the opposite direction to the paper strip. According to f = mu F_{N}, the frictional force is equal in size. According to I = ft, the slower it is pulled, the greater the impulse on the cup, and the faster it is pulled, the smaller the impulse on the cup. Therefore, to avoid the cup falling over, it should be pulled quickly. Hence, C is incorrect. D. When an egg falls from the same height, the speed before landing is the same, so the momentum before landing is also the same. However, the final speed is zero in both cases, which means that the change in momentum is the same. According to the momentum theorem, the impulse is also the same. However, since the time of fall on a concrete floor is shorter, the change in momentum is faster, which leads to a greater impact force, making the egg more likely to break. Hence, D is correct.

(2016 - k)! = frac{2015!}{(k-1)! (2016 - k)!} (k-1)!

They also cannot be in the same column since they would need to be the smallest value in that column. - If they are in different rows and columns, without loss of generality, assume A_{i j} is in row i and column j, and A_{k l} is in row k and column l: - This means: [ A_{i j} < A_{i l} quad text{(since A_{i l} is larger in same row)} ] [ A_{k l} > A_{i l} quad text{(since A_{i l} is smaller in same column)} ] So, [ A_{i j} < A_{k l} ] - Similarly, [ A_{i j} > A_{k j} quad text{(since A_{k j} is smaller in same column)} ] [ A_{k l} < A_{k j} quad text{(since A_{k j} is larger in the same row)} ] So, [ A_{i j} > A_{k l} ] This leads to a contradiction since A_{i j} cannot be both greater than and less than A_{k l} at the same time.

Since mathop{text{lcm}}[m,15] = mathop{text{lcm}}[3,5,k] = 45 where k is a component of m, we recognize that k must introduce no other primes but could include an additional factor of 3 to fit the requirement 3^2times 5^1=45. Thus, the acceptable values of m include only those factors contributing to 45, upon existing base of 15 without extra prime. The divisors of 45 that meet these requirements are 15, 45 (since both contain only the factors of 3 and 5, and any extra factor would violate the condition of the LCM equalling 45).

Whenever she babysat for a child, that child was no more than half her age at the time. She stopped babysitting 10 years ago, and the current age of the oldest person for whom Jane could have babysat is 24. How old is Jane currently?","completion":"Let's denote Jane's current age as J. According to the information given, the oldest person Jane could have babysat is currently 24 years old. Let's denote this person's current age as P. We know that Jane stopped babysitting 10 years ago. Therefore, 10 years ago, the age of the oldest person she could have babysat (P) was 24 - 10 = 14 years old. At that time, Jane was also 10 years younger than she is now. So, 10 years ago, Jane's age was J - 10. Since the child was no more than half Jane's age when she babysat, we can write the following inequality: P ≤ (J - 10) / 2 We know that P was 14 years old 10 years ago, so we can substitute P with 14: 14 ≤ (J - 10) / 2 Now, let's solve for J: 28 ≤ J - 10 28 + 10 ≤ J 38 ≤ J So, Jane was at least 38 years old 10 years ago. Therefore, Jane's current age is at least 38 + 10 = 48 years old. However, since the oldest person she could have babysat is currently 24, and that person was no more than half her age when she babysat, we can also say that when Jane was 28 (twice the age of the oldest person she babysat), she could have been babysitting. So, if Jane was 28 when she was babysitting the oldest child, and that child is now 24, then the time that has passed since Jane was 28 is the current age of the child minus the age of the child when Jane was babysitting (which would be half of Jane's age at that time, so 28/2 = 14). 24 (current age of the child) - 14 (age of the child when Jane was babysitting) = 10 years have passed since Jane was 28. Therefore, Jane is currently 28 + 10 = 38 years old. So, Jane is currently boxed{38} years old."},{"prompt":"A train of some length takes 6 seconds to cross a man walking at 5 kmph in the direction opposite to that of the train.

The speed of the train is given as 54.99520038396929 kmph, and the man is walking at 5 kmph in the opposite direction. When two objects are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 54.99520038396929 kmph + 5 kmph Relative speed = 59.99520038396929 kmph Now, we need to convert this relative speed from kmph to meters per second (m/s) to match the time given in seconds. 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds Relative speed in m/s = 59.99520038396929 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 59.99520038396929 * (10/36) Relative speed in m/s = 59.99520038396929 * (5/18) Relative speed in m/s = 16.66533343999147 m/s Now that we have the relative speed in m/s, we can use the time it takes for the train to cross the man to find the length of the train.

Now, for x > 1, we have dfrac {f(x)}{x} > f(1)=0, thus f(x) > 0. For 0 < x < 1, dfrac {f(x)}{x} < f(1)=0, hence f(x) < 0. Since f(x) is an odd function, for -1 < x < 0, we have f(x)=-f(-x) > 0.

Under this transformation: - Let ( K' ) be the reflection of ( K ) about diameter ( AB ). - Let ( M' ) be the reflection of ( M ) about diameter ( AB ). 5. Since the semicircle has been reflected, note that ( K' ) and ( C ) and ( M ) are collinear, as well as ( K ), ( C ), and ( M' ). 6.

By the properties of the inversion: [ X = A', quad Y = B', quad Z = C' ] where A', B', C' are the images of the points A, B, C under this inversion, respectively. 4. **Applying Inversion Results:** For an inversion with respect to omega: - The line passing through the points A, I (i.e., AI) transforms such that A maps to point X on the line FE, - Similarly, BI maps such that B maps to point Y on the line FD, - And CI maps such that C maps to point Z on the line ED. 5. **Midpoints Identification:** By examining the properties and positions: [ X, Y, text{and } Z text{ are the midpoints of the sides } FE, FD, text{ and } ED text{ respectively in triangle } DEF. ] 6. **Euler Circle Identification:** The midpoints of the sides of a triangle, along with the feet of the altitudes and the midpoints of segments from the vertices to the orthocenter, lie on the nine-point circle (also known as the Euler circle) of that triangle. In this scenario, since X, Y, Z are indeed the midpoints, they define this Euler circle for triangle triangle DEF. **Conclusion:** Thus, the inversion of the circumcircle Gamma of triangle ABC through the incircle omega will map to the Euler circle (nine-point circle) of triangle triangle DEF.

This result is obtained by using the properties of the basic inequality. The problem tests the understanding of the basic inequality, as well as logical reasoning and computational skills. It can be considered a moderate-difficulty problem. To make it more clear, let's break it down step by step: 1. First, we recognize that a, b, c are positive real numbers and their sum is 1. 2. We then multiply the given equation a + b + c = 1 by frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}. This gives us (a + b + c)(frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}), which is equal to frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} since a + b + c = 1. 3. Next, we apply the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. For positive real numbers x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n, the AM-GM inequality states that frac{x_1 + x_2 + ldots + x_n}{n} geq sqrt[n]{x_1 cdot x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_n}, with equality if and only if x_1 = x_2 = ldots = x_n. 4. In our case, we set x_1 = a, x_2 = b, x_3 = c, x_4 = frac{1}{a}, x_5 = frac{1}{b}, x_6 = frac{1}{c}. Applying the AM-GM inequality, we have frac{(a + b + c) + (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c})}{6} geq sqrt[6]{abc cdot frac{1}{abc}} = 1. 5. Multiplying both sides by 6, we obtain (a + b + c) + (frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c}) geq 6. Since a + b + c = 1, it follows that frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{b} + frac{1}{c} geq 9. 6.

A few years ago, the total age of the committee was ( T + O ), and the average age was ( (T + O) / 10 ). Now, the total age of the committee is ( T + 9X + N ), where ( X ) is the number of years that have passed. The average age is still ( (T + O) / 10 ). So we have the equation: [ T + O = T + 9X + N ] Since ( N = O - 40 ), we can substitute ( N ) in the equation: [ T + O = T + 9X + (O - 40) ] Simplifying the equation: [ T + O = T + 9X + O - 40 ] [ T + O - O = T + 9X - 40 ] [ T = T + 9X - 40 ] Since ( T ) cancels out, we are left with: [ 9X = 40 ] Now, we can solve for ( X ): [ X = 40 / 9 ] [ X = 4.44 ] Since ( X ) represents the number of years that have passed, and we typically count years in whole numbers, we can round ( X ) to the nearest whole number. However, in this context, it's not possible to have a fraction of a year for the average age to remain the same, as the age of people increases by whole numbers. Therefore, the question might be based on an assumption that doesn't reflect real-life scenarios accurately. But mathematically, the average age would be the same after approximately boxed{4.44} years."},{"prompt":"Given that i is the imaginary unit, find the value of the complex number (1i)^{2} frac {4+2i}{12i}4i^{2014}= ______.","completion":"First, we simplify the expression step by step. 1.

Amin took this dominos and started to put them in a row so that numbers on the adjacent sides of the dominos are equal. He has put k dominos in this way, got bored and went away. After this Anton came to see this k dominos, and he realized that he can't put all the remaining dominos in this row by the rules. For which smallest value of k is this possible? *Oleksii Masalitin*","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the smallest value of ( k ) such that after placing ( k ) dominos, it becomes impossible to place the remaining dominos in a row according to the given rules. The answer is given as ( frac{3n-5}{2} ). Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Construction of a Sequence:** We start by constructing a sequence of dominos that demonstrates the answer. Consider the sequence: [ [n,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,1], [1,4], [4,5], [5,1], ldots, [1,n-3], [n-3,n-2], [n-2,1], [1,n-1] ] This sequence works because ( n ) is odd, and the only remaining domino with ( 1 ) is ([1,1]), which cannot be placed by Anton. 2. **Suppose ( k < frac{3n-5}{2} ):** Let a domino be *bad* if it has the same number on both ends, and all other dominos be *good*. First, remove all bad dominos in Amin's path. Let ( k' ) be the number of remaining dominos, so ( k' < frac{3n-5}{2} ). 3. **Graph Representation:** The sequence of good dominos can be represented as a path on ( K_n ), the complete graph on ( n ) vertices. Let the set of edges left after Amin creates a sequence be ( G ). We need to show that Anton can create an Eulerian path on ( G ) (excluding bad dominos for now), starting on the vertex ( v_f ) where Amin finished. 4. **Lemma: ( G ) is Connected:** - **Proof by Contradiction:** Suppose ( G ) is not connected. Let ( x ) be the number of vertices in one connected component. Then at least ( x(n-x) ) edges must be removed, as these are edges between different connected components. - For ( x = 2 ) or ( x = n-2 ), note that ( k' geq x(n-x) = 2(n-2) geq frac{3n-5}{2} ) since ( n geq 3 ). - ( x(n-x) ) increases for ( x < frac{n}{2} ) and decreases for ( x > frac{n}{2} ). For ( 2 leq x leq n-2 ), ( k' geq x(n-x) geq frac{3n-5}{2} ). - The only remaining cases are ( x = 1 ) or ( x = n-1 ). Here, one connected group has ( n-1 ) vertices while the other has 1 vertex ( v ). Amin's path would have length ( k_{min} = frac{3}{2}(n-1) - 1 = frac{3n-5}{2} ), so ( k' geq k_{min} = frac{3n-5}{2} ). Since ( k' < frac{3n-5}{2} ), ( G ) must be connected. (blacksquare) 5. **Existence of Eulerian Path:** - All vertices in ( K_n ) have even degree as ( n-1 ) is even. Amin's path ensures all vertices have even degree except the first and last vertex ( v_i ) and ( v_f ). - By Euler's Theorem, for any connected graph with all even degrees, there exists an Eulerian cycle. If ( v_i ) and ( v_f ) are the same vertex, we can use this theorem directly. 6. **Extension of Euler's Theorem:** - **Claim:** For any connected graph ( G ) with all even degrees except for two vertices ( x ) and ( y ) that have odd degrees, there exists an Eulerian path from ( v_x ) to ( v_y ). - **Proof:** - **Case 1:** ( e_{v_x,v_y} ) is not in ( G ). Adding ( e_{v_x,v_y} ) to ( G ) to get ( G' ), we have a Eulerian cycle on ( G' ). Removing ( e_{v_x,v_y} ) gives a Eulerian path between ( v_x ) and ( v_y ). - **Case 2:** ( e_{v_x,v_y} ) is in ( G ). Removing ( e_{v_x,v_y} ) from ( G ) to get ( G' ), which has all even degrees. If ( G' ) is connected, we have a Eulerian cycle on ( G' ). Shifting along the cycle to start and end at ( v_x ) and then adding ( e_{v_x,v_y} ) at the end gives a Eulerian path from ( v_x ) to ( v_y ). - If ( G' ) is not connected, it forms 2 connected components where ( v_x ) and ( v_y ) are in different components. Each component has a Eulerian cycle. Combining these cycles with ( e_{v_x,v_y} ) gives a Eulerian path in ( G ). (blacksquare) 7. **Adding Back Bad Dominos:** Since ( G ) is connected, for any number ( i ) with ( 1 leq i leq n ), Anton will have at least one good domino ( d_i ) remaining with ( i ) as one of its numbers. Adding back Amin's bad dominos, Anton can place any bad dominos that Amin has not already placed by adding them between corresponding good dominos.

We start with the given inequality: [ frac{cos beta - cos gamma}{cos alpha - cos beta} > frac{8}{pi^2} cdot frac{gamma - beta}{beta - alpha} ] 2.

Using the trigonometric identities for the cosine function, we can rewrite the difference of cosines: [ cos x - cos y = -2 sin left(frac{x + y}{2}right) sin left(frac{x - y}{2}right) ] Applying this identity to both the numerator and the denominator, we get: [ frac{-2 sin left(frac{gamma + beta}{2}right) sin left(frac{gamma - beta}{2}right)}{-2 sin left(frac{beta + alpha}{2}right) sin left(frac{beta - alpha}{2}right)} = frac{sin left(frac{gamma + beta}{2}right) sin left(frac{gamma - beta}{2}right)}{sin left(frac{beta + alpha}{2}right) sin left(frac{beta - alpha}{2}right)} ] 3. Hence, the inequality becomes: [ frac{sin left(frac{gamma + beta}{2}right) cdot sin left(frac{gamma - beta}{2}right)}{sin left(frac{beta + alpha}{2}right) cdot sin left(frac{beta - alpha}{2}right)} > frac{8}{pi^2} cdot frac{gamma - beta}{beta - alpha} ] 4.

Let the coordinates of the marked points on the graph of the polynomial P(x) with integer coefficients be left( x_1, P left( x_1 right) right) and left( x_2, P left( x_2 right) right), where x_1 neq x_2. 2. To simplify the problem, we can transfer the origin of the coordinates to the point left( x_2, P left( x_2 right) right). By doing this, we can consider x_2 = 0 and P left( x_2 right) = P(0) = 0. Consequently, P(x) is divisible by x because P(x_2) = 0 means x_2 is a root of P(x). 3. The distance between the points left( x_1, P left( x_1 right) right) and (0,0) is given by the Euclidean distance formula: [ sqrt{ (x_1)^2 + left( P(x_1) right)^2 } ] 4. According to the condition, this distance must be an integer. Let’s denote: [ d = sqrt{ x_1^2 + left( P(x_1) right)^2 } ] Thus, (d) is an integer. 5. Let us introduce the variable m such that: [ m = frac{P(x_1)}{x_1} ] Since P(x_1) and x_1 are both integers, m is also an integer. 6. Since the distance is an integer, we have: [ d = |x_1| sqrt{ 1 + left(frac{P(x_1)}{x_1}right)^2 } ] Substituting m for frac{P(x_1)}{x_1}, we get: [ d = |x_1| sqrt{ 1 + m^2 } ] 7. For d to be an integer, sqrt{1 + m^2} must be rational. However, if sqrt{1 + m^2} is rational and results from an integer, it must itself be an integer (a rational square root of an integer is an integer). 8. Therefore: [ sqrt{ 1 + m^2 } = n ] where n is an integer. 9. This leads to: [ 1 + m^2 = n^2 ] 10. Rearranging the equation we get: [ n^2 - m^2 = 1 quad Rightarrow quad (n - m)(n + m) = 1 ] 11.

Solving both cases, we find: [ m = 0 ] 13. Therefore: [ m = frac{P(x_1)}{x_1} = 0 quad Rightarrow quad P(x_1) = 0 ] 14. This means the polynomial must be zero at x_1 if the distance d is to be an integer and the points to lie on a horizontal line. Conclusion: Since P(x_1) = 0, both points (x_1, P(x_1)) and (x_2, P(x_2)) = (0, 0) lie on a line which is parallel to the x-axis, verifying that the segment joining these points is parallel to the x-axis. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that the function y=f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}, and for x>0, f(x)=2^x, find f(3).","completion":"Since f(x) is given as an odd function, we have the key property that f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain, in this case, mathbb{R}.

Next, we calculate the weight charge. The item weighs 55 pounds, which is 5 pounds over the 50-pound threshold. Therefore, the weight charge is 5 pounds * 0.15/pound = 0.75.

This can be represented as choosing 1 out of 2 options, which is calculated using combinations. The formula for combinations is {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}. In this case, n=2 and r=1, so we have: [ {C}_{2}^{1} = frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = 2 ] This means there are 2 ways to choose the first class. 2. **Arranging the Next Two Classes**: After choosing the first class, we have two subjects left among Chinese, Mathematics, and English (excluding the first class). We need to arrange these two subjects in the next two slots. This is a permutation problem because the order matters. The formula for permutations is {A}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}.

Let ( d_i ) be the distance from ( P ) to the ( i )-th face of the polyhedron. We need to show that: [ sum_{i=1}^n d_i < n - 2 ] 3. **Using the Circumradius:** Assume the point ( P ) is the circumcenter of the polyhedron, and the circumradius (the distance from ( P ) to any vertex) is 1. This assumption simplifies the problem, as it allows us to use geometric properties of the polyhedron. 4. **Considering Caps on the Sphere:** For each face of the polyhedron, consider the cap ( mathcal{C}_i ) on the sphere centered at ( P ) with radius 1.

To demonstrate that ( overrightarrow{A_1 A_3'} ) has integer coordinates, we analyze: [ 2 overrightarrow{A_1 A_3'} = overrightarrow{A_1 A_2'} + overrightarrow{A_1 A_3} + overrightarrow{A_1 A_4'} ] Each vector on the right-hand side has integer coordinates since: [ (overrightarrow{A_1 A_2'})^2 = (overrightarrow{A_1 A_3})^2 = (overrightarrow{A_1 A_4'})^2 = a ] and their dot products: [ overrightarrow{A_1 A_2'} cdot overrightarrow{A_1 A_3} = overrightarrow{A_1 A_2'} cdot overrightarrow{A_1 A_4'} = overrightarrow{A_1 A_3} cdot overrightarrow{A_1 A_4'} = frac{a}{2} = b ] 8. **Coordinate Completion:** Hence, coefficients ( x, y, z ) which are the coordinates of ( 2 overrightarrow{A_1 A_3'} ) are integers. With ( x, y, z ) are integers, confirmed by sum squares modulo 4 rules ensuring they must be even. 9. **Conclusion:** Given ( 2 overrightarrow{A_1 A_3'} ) coefficients are integers implying all coordinates of ( overrightarrow{A_1 A_3'} ) are integers. Consequently, the initial hypothesis with any of the four vertices given as integer coordinates confirms that: boxed{text{All vertices of the cube must have integer coordinates.}} Thus, the whole problem is solved, and every vertex in this cube must have integer coordinates, terminating the proof: [ blacksquare ]"},{"prompt":"Given that the sequence {b_{n}} is a geometric sequence, b_{9} is the arithmetic mean of 3 and 5.

The player who takes the last matchstick wins the game. In a game played correctly, who will win?","completion":"1. **Introduction to the Problem**: There is a pile of 10,000,000 matches. Two players take turns picking a number of matches from the pile. Each time it’s a player's turn, they can take P^n matches, where P is a prime number, and n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ldots. The player who takes the last match wins the game. We are asked to find the winning strategy and determine which player will win if both play optimally. 2. **Prime Powers Analysis**: Prime powers up to the context of this problem are: [ P^0, P^1, P^2, ldots ] For simplicity, consider the small primes like 2, 3, 5, 7, etc., and their powers like 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 3^1 = 3, 5^0 = 1, etc. 3. **Divisibility Strategy**: A critical strategy emerges that involves creating favorable conditions for the first player. Specifically, the strategy involves leaving a number of matches that is a multiple of 6 after each turn, if possible. 4. **First Player’s Strategy**: The first player should always aim to leave a number of matches that is a multiple of 6 after their turn. This ensures the second player is forced into a suboptimal position, where no matter how many matches they take, they cannot continue the optimal sequence. To illustrate: - If the initial number of matches is 10,000,000, the first player must reduce this to leave a multiple of 6 to the second player: [ 10{,}000{,}000 = 6 times 1{,}666{,}666 + 4 ] - The first player would then take 4 matches: [ 10{,}000{,}000 - 4 = 9{,}999{,}996 ] Now, ( 9{,}999{,}996) is a multiple of 6. 5. **Second Player’s Moves**: Whatever amount of matches the second player takes, the first player can always respond in a way to restore the condition of leaving a multiple of 6. For instance: - If the second player takes P^n (say 5) matches from the pile, new pile count becomes: [ 9{,}999{,}996 - 5 = 9{,}999{,}991 ] - The first player then calculates the difference to the nearest multiple of 6: [ 9{,}999{,}991 = 6 times 1{,}666{,}665 + 1 ] Therefore, the first player should take 1 match (since 1 = 6 - 5 matches taken by the second player). 6. **Conclusion**: By continuously applying this strategy, the first player can always ensure that after their turn, the number of remaining matches is a multiple of 6, such that when the count reduces to 6, they can take the last 1 match when the pile reaches precisely 1 match. **Conclusion**: The first player will always win by adopting this strategy, ensuring the number of remaining matches is a multiple of 6 after their turn.

We can reframe it using the right triangle properties to introduce x and y: [ = frac{frac{y}{d}}{a} + frac{frac{x}{d}}{b} ] 3. Since triangles triangle APT and triangle ABC are similar (angles are equal), we have the ratio: [ frac{TP}{CB} = frac{AT}{AC}, quad text{or} quad frac{y}{a} = frac{b - x}{b} ] 4.

Multiply both sides of the original equation by a b d: [ a b = b d cdot cos delta + a d cdot sin delta ] 2. The left-hand side represents twice the area of the right triangle ABC. We need to show that the right-hand side also represents twice the same area. 3. Using the trigonometric identity cos delta = sin (90^circ - delta), the right-hand side becomes: [ b d cdot sin (90^circ - delta) + a d cdot sin delta ] 4. Observe that the term b d cdot sin (90^circ - delta) / 2 represents the area of triangle CBP and the term a d cdot sin delta / 2 represents the area of triangle CAP. 5. Therefore, the sum left(frac{b d cdot sin (90^circ - delta)}{2} + frac{a d cdot sin delta}{2}right) is indeed equivalent to twice the area of triangle ABC.

The hypotenuse's equation then is: [ frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{b} = 1 ] 2. The coordinates of point D are (d cos delta, d sin delta). 3. Since D lies on the hypotenuse, these coordinates must satisfy its equation: [ frac{d cos delta}{a} + frac{d sin delta}{b} = 1 ] 4.

Since Polina answered \\"yes\\" to exactly two questions, we note the following important relations: - If the number were divisible by 143, then it would also be divisible by both 11 and 13 (since ( 143 = 11 times 13 )). Therefore, there would be at least three affirmative answers (to Masha, Irina, and Olya), which contradicts Polina's answer. Thus, the number is not divisible by 143. 3.

Thus, Polina's number cannot be divisible by both 11 and 13 simultaneously. Therefore, from the answers to Masha and Irina, only one can be \\"yes.\\" 4. Since Polina must have exactly two affirmative answers, and one of them isn't Olya, at least one affirmative answer must come from Anya, i.e., the number is less than 15. 5.

This implies that every positional configuration of triangle KLM maintains a boundary fixed point, indicating a common rotational center O. Step 3: Common Intersecting Point As the triangles change but remain similar, the circumcircles of LMA, MKB, and KLC must intersect at this common point O. Thus, the three circumcircles pass through the common point O. [ boxed{} ] Part (b): To prove that the triangle formed by the centers of the circles S_1, S_2, and S_3 is similar to triangle ABC. Step 1: Identifying Centers Let O_1, O_2, and O_3 be the centers of the circumcircles S_1, S_2, and S_3 respectively, and let their common intersection point be O. Step 2: Cyclic Quadrilateral Property Since quadrilateral ALOM is cyclic, we have the following angle relation: [ angle AMO + angle ALO = 180^circ ] This implies: [ angle CMO = angle OLA = angle CLO ] Similarly, [ angle BKO = angle CLO ] Step 3: Angle Equality From the above cyclic properties, the angles around point O yield: [ angle AO_1O = angle BO_2O = angle CO_3O ] Step 4: Similarity Argument Since AO_1O, BO_2O, and CO_3O triangles exhibit the same angles, they are similar to each other. Therefore, the triangle O_1O_2O_3 can be obtained from triangle ABC through a central similarity transformation with center O and angle of rotation, ensuring the similarity ratio remains constant. This proves the triangles are similar triangle O_1O_2O_3 sim triangle ABC.

Investigate the expression by regrouping terms. Notice that: [ a + c text{ can be grouped together, and } b + d text{ can be grouped together separately.} ] 3. Let (x = a + c) and (y = b + d). Thus, the expression can be rewritten as: [ a + 2b + c + 2d - ab - bc - cd - da = (a + c) + 2(b + d) - (ab + bc + cd + da). ] 4. Substituting (x) and (y) into the expression: [ x + 2y - (a b + b c + c d + d a). ] 5. The terms (ab + bc + cd + da) can cause complexity since each involves combinations of (a, b, c), and (d).

Substituting these into the condition, we get: [ xy = (ad)(bd) = a b d^2 ] and [ x^3 + y^3 = (ad)^3 + (bd)^3 = a^3 d^3 + b^3 d^3 = d^3 (a^3 + b^3) ] 4. The condition xy mid x^3 + y^3 becomes: [ ab d^2 mid d^3 (a^3 + b^3) ] Simplifying, we get: [ ab d^2 mid d^3 (a^3 + b^3) implies ab mid d (a^3 + b^3) ] 5. Since gcd(a, b) = 1, it follows that gcd(a^3 + b^3, ab) = 1. Therefore, ab mid d. This implies that there exists some integer c such that: [ d = abc ] 6.

If the set does not contain the digit 0 (probability (left(frac{9}{10}right)^{20})), the product will end in 0 if it contains at least one even digit and the digit 5.

Step 1: Preliminary Lemma First, we need a lemma regarding the properties of prime numbers and their residues: **Lemma**: If p and q are prime numbers both greater than k, then the residues r and s defined by - r = p mod q satisfies r geq frac{q}{2}, - s = q mod p satisfies s geq frac{p}{2}. This lemma ensures that the residues are sufficiently large for the following properties to hold. Step 2: Consider the Case When ( p > q ) Using the lemma, we analyze the valuation v_p of the binomial coefficient binom{2n}{n}: [ v_pleft(binom{2n}{n}right) = frac{S_p(n) + S_p(n) - S_p(2n)}{p-1}, ] where S_p(m) represents the sum of the base-p digits of m. Since we have 2n = n + n in terms of its base-p digits, a carry happens if and only if there is a digit sum of at least p. Given the large residues from the lemma, we know that: [ p mid binom{2n}{n}. ] Step 3: Consider the Case When ( p < q ) Similarly, when p < q, we examine the residue conditions: [ r = p mod q quad text{with} quad r geq frac{q}{2}, quad implies quad q < 2p, ] and [ s = q mod p quad text{with} quad s geq frac{p}{2}, quad implies quad q > frac{3p}{2}. ] This indicates that there is an interval left(frac{3p}{2}, 2pright) within which we must check for prime numbers q > k. Step 4: Infinitely Many Primes By the prime number theorem, we know that for sufficiently large m, the interval left(frac{3m}{2}, 2mright) always contains at least one prime number. Hence, there are infinitely many choices for p and q such that the constructed n = pq + k meets the requirement.

Since points A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}) lie on the parabola y=2x^{2}, we have 2(x_{2}^{2}+x_{1}^{2})=x_{2}+x_{1}+2m, which is 2[(x_{2}+x_{1})^{2}-2x_{2}x_{1}]=x_{2}+x_{1}+2m (4). Substituting (1) and (2) into (4) and simplifying, we get 2m=3, solving for m, we find m= frac{3}{2}, thus, the correct choice is boxed{A}."},{"prompt":"f the sum of the series 1 + 3y + 5y^2 + 7y^3 + dotsb = 16, find y.","completion":"Let T = 1 + 3y + 5y^2 + 7y^3 + dotsb.

According to the problem, when the number is doubled, it exceeds its one fifth by 9.

We can do this by subtracting (1/5)x from both sides: 2x - (1/5)x = 9 To combine the x terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 2 and 1/5 is 5, so we can rewrite 2x as (10/5)x: (10/5)x - (1/5)x = 9 Now we can combine the x terms: (9/5)x = 9 To solve for x, we divide both sides by (9/5): x = 9 / (9/5) When we divide by a fraction, it's the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So we multiply by 5/9: x = 9 * (5/9) The 9s cancel out: x = 5 Now that we have the value of x, we can find the square of this number: x^2 = 5^2 = 25 So the square of the number is boxed{25} ."},{"prompt":"The value of (2)^{2004} + 3 times (2)^{2003} is ( ) A: 2^{2003} B: 2^{2003} C: 2^{2004} D: 2^{2004}","completion":"(-2)^{2004} can be expressed as (-2) times (-2)^{2003}.
