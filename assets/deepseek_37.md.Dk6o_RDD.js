The block, initially 4 inches long, 4 inches wide, and 1 inch high, is painted red on all six sides. When it is cut into 1-inch cubes, the distribution of red faces among these cubes can be categorized based on their positions within the original block: 1. **Corner Cubes**: There are 4 corner cubes in the block. Each corner cube has 3 faces exposed and painted red. Since they are at the corners, they have 3 sides painted. 2. **Edge Cubes**: Along the edges, excluding the corners, there are 8 cubes. Each of these cubes has 2 faces exposed and painted red. They are positioned along the edges but not at the corners, resulting in 2 sides painted. 3. **Face Cubes**: On each face of the block, excluding the edges, there are 4 central cubes (but since the block is only 1 inch high, these are essentially the same as the edge cubes in this context). These cubes have only 1 face painted red. They are at the center of each face. 4. **Inner Cubes**: Finally, the cubes that are completely inside (if the block were larger) would have no faces painted, but in this case, since the block is only 1 inch high, there are no completely inner cubes. Given the problem's interest in cubes with an even number of red faces, we focus on the corner cubes and the central cubes on the faces. However, since the block is only 1 inch high, all cubes are either on an edge or a corner, and there are no \\"central\\" cubes in the traditional sense. The correction to the initial analysis is as follows: - **Corner Cubes**: 4 corner cubes, each with 3 red faces, which was incorrectly identified. The correct observation is that each corner cube has 3 faces exposed and painted red, which is an odd number and not what we're looking for. - **Edge Cubes (excluding corners)**: 8 cubes with 2 red faces, which is an even number and matches our criteria. - **Central Cubes on the Faces**: In the context of this problem, these would be the cubes not on the edge or corner, but given the dimensions, all cubes are either corner or edge cubes. Therefore, the correct analysis for cubes with an even number of red faces includes only the edge cubes (excluding corners), which are 8 in number. The corner cubes, despite the initial incorrect categorization, do not meet the criteria for an even number of red faces.

Considering (a leq b leq c) (without loss of generality), we look for integral solutions under these constraints. Since (a + b + c = 9), the largest possible value for (c) would be less than half of 9 (because (a) and (b) must also be positive integers), i.e., (c < 4.5).

This is because the definition of a hyperbola requires that terms associated with x^2 and y^2 have opposite signs when the equation is in standard form. To explore whether the condition ab < 0 is sufficient, necessary, or both, consider the following: - If ab < 0, then a and b have opposite signs, and the equation could represent a hyperbola (assuming c neq 0). This suggests that ab < 0 is a sufficient condition for the equation to describe a hyperbola. - However, to determine if the condition is necessary, we must consider whether every equation of the form ax^2+by^2=c that represents a hyperbola also satisfies ab < 0. Suppose there exist a and b such that ab ge 0, and the equation is not that of a hyperbola. For example, if a = b = 1 (or any positive numbers), then ab > 0, and the equation would represent an ellipse (or a circle, if a = b) instead of a hyperbola. Conversely, if a = b = -1 (or any negative numbers), then ab > 0, and the equation would not represent any real conic section (as x^2 and y^2 would add to negative c). Thus, the condition ab < 0 is not a necessary condition for the equation to represent a hyperbola, as the equation could also represent a hyperbola when a and b are both zero or positive (as long as they are not the same sign).

Prove that the axes intersect at a single point and that each pair of axes form a smaller angle of 60^{circ}.","completion":"To prove the given statement, we need to show that the three axes of symmetry of the shape intersect at one point and that each pair of axes form an angle of 60^{circ}. We will proceed in the following steps. 1. **Consideration of Reflection and Symmetry:** If a shape has two axes of symmetry, (t_{1}) and (t_{2}), the reflection of (t_{2}) about (t_{1}), denoted (t_{2}^{*}), is also an axis of symmetry. This is because the reflection of a symmetry axis about another symmetry axis must also be a symmetry axis of the shape. Since (t_{1}) is an axis of symmetry, reflecting (t_{2}) about (t_{1}) yields (t_{2}^{*}), and this must be another symmetry axis of the same shape. 2. **Intersection of Axes:** Given that the shape has exactly three axes of symmetry, any two axes must intersect. Suppose the shape had two axes of symmetry, (t_{1}) and (t_{2}), which are parallel or skew. We can find a line (n) perpendicular to both (t_{1}) and (t_{2}), intersecting them at points (N_{1}) and (N_{2}), respectively. The reflection of (t_{2}) about (t_{1}) produces (t_{2}^{*}), which intersects (n) at the point (N_{2}^{*}), the reflection of (N_{2}) about (N_{1}). Similarly, the reflection of (t_{1}) about (t_{2}^{*}) produces (t_{1}^{*}), which intersects (n) at (N_{1}^{*}), the reflection of (N_{1}) about (N_{2}^{*}). Since (N_{1}^{*}) and (N_{2}^{*}) are distinct from (N_{1}) and (N_{2}) respectively, and we would obtain more than the initially considered axes, this contradicts the assumption that the shape has exactly three axes. Therefore, the axes cannot be parallel or skew; hence, they must intersect in pairs. 3. **Non-Perpendicular Axes:** The three axes cannot all be pairwise perpendicular. If (t_{1}) and (t_{2}) are both perpendicular to (t_{3}), then (t_{1}) and (t_{2}) would either be parallel or skew, which we have already proven to be impossible. Therefore, the angle between (t_{1}) and (t_{2}) must differ from 90^{circ}. 4. **Angle Between the Axes:** Let the angle between (t_{1}) and (t_{2}) be neither 90^{circ} nor 180^{circ}. Reflecting (t_{2}) about (t_{1}) yields (t_{3}), as we previously noted. Thus, (t_{3}) must also pass through the intersection of (t_{1}) and (t_{2}). Reflecting (t_{1}) about (t_{3}) gives back (t_{2}), confirming that each axis is reflected onto another axis. If the shape is rotated by the smaller of the angles between any pair of these axes, it maps onto itself again thrice consecutively, i.e., from (t_{1} rightarrow t_{3} rightarrow t_{2} rightarrow t_{1}). As a result, this angle must be 60^{circ} or 120^{circ}. The angle between the axes is the smaller of these two possible angles, which is 60^{circ}. Consequently, each pair of symmetry axes forms an angle of 60^{circ}, and they all intersect at a single point. # Conclusion: [ boxed{Q.E.D.} ]"},{"prompt":"f the complex number z satisfies (3 z) cdot i = 2 (where i is the imaginary unit), then z = , ?","completion":"Let z = a + bi, then (3 - a - bi) cdot i = b + (3 - a) cdot i = 2, thus, b = 2 and a = 3, therefore, z = 3 + 2i, so the answer is: boxed{3 + 2i}. **Analysis:** By setting z = a + bi and equating the coefficients, we can solve for the values of a and b."},{"prompt":"You have five shirts and six pairs of pants.

Therefore, (angle PAD = widehat{PQ}), which is fixed because the arc (PQ) is fixed. 4. **Angle (angle APD)**: - The angle (angle APD) is half of the angle (angle APB) because (D) lies on the angle bisector of (angle CPQ). Thus, (angle APD = frac{angle APB}{2}). 5. **Fixed Angle (angle APB)**: - The angle (angle APB) is fixed because it is the angle subtended by the chord (AB) in the circle. Since (P) and (Q) are fixed points, (angle APB) remains constant for any line (ell) through (Q). 6. **Conclusion**: - Since both (angle PAD) and (angle APD) are fixed, (angle PDQ) is also fixed.

There are two primary cases to consider: - Case 1: These three equations share a common root. - Case 2: These equations do not share a common root among all of them. 3. **Case 1: Equations Share a Common Root:** Assume the common root to be (a). Hence, the equations can be represented as follows: [ (x - a)(x - b) = 0, quad (x - a)(x - c) = 0, quad text{and} quad (x - a)(x - d) = 0 ] where (b, c,) and (d) are distinct and different from (a).

To simplify this, we can model the path of the particle by reflecting the square across its sides repeatedly, effectively transforming the particle's path into a straight line in an infinite grid of squares. 2. **Objective**: - We need to count the number of starting directions from which the particle will reach a corner after traveling a distance ( k ) or less. 3. **Counting Directions**: - The particle reaches a corner if and only if the transformed straight line path passes through a lattice point. Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of lattice points within a circle of radius ( k ). 4. **Lattice Points in a Circle**: - The number of lattice points inside a circle of radius ( k ) is approximately the area of the circle, which is ( pi k^2 ). 5. **Shadowing Problem**: - There's a complicating factor called the \\"shadowing problem\\". If the starting point lies on a line of lattice points, it may be shadowed by closer lattice points, reducing the number of reachable points. Nevertheless, the number of lattice points remains an upper bound. 6. **Upper Bound Calculation**: - A circle of radius ( k ) has an area of ( pi k^2 ). This means it includes about ( pi k^2 ) lattice points, each being the center of a unit square. However, the boundary unit squares might be incomplete. - The maximal discrepancy due to incomplete squares can be handled by considering a slightly larger radius. The maximum distance between two points in a unit square is ( sqrt{2} ). - So, if we consider the circle of radius ( k + sqrt{2} ), it will encompass all the relevant lattice points of a circle of radius ( k ). 7. **Number of Lattice Points in Extended Circle**: - Number of lattice points in a circle of radius ( k + sqrt{2} ) is approximately equal to the area of the circle: [ pi (k + sqrt{2})^2 = pi (k^2 + 2ksqrt{2} + 2) ] Thus, [ pi k^2 + 2pi ksqrt{2} + 2pi ] 8. **Setting the Coefficients ( a_2, a_1, a_0 )**: - Therefore, to satisfy the inequality ( c(k) leq a_2 k^2 + a_1 k + a_0 ) for all ( P ) and ( k ), we set: [ a_2 = pi, quad a_1 = 2pi sqrt{2}, quad a_0 = 2pi ] 9. **Lower Bound and Verification**: - Similarly, any unit square completely within the circle of radius ( k - sqrt{2} ) is entirely contained. This gives: [ pi (k - sqrt{2})^2 = pi (k^2 - 2ksqrt{2} + 2) ] - No shadowing problem occurs if we take ( P ) such that one coordinate is rational and the other irrational. 10. **Conclusion**: - The smallest constant value for ( a_2 ) ensuring the inequality holds for all ( k ) is ( pi ).

This implies the distance (d) increases linearly with time (t) in this interval. Consequently, the graph of (d) vs. (t) should have a positive, constant slope in this segment. 2. **Next 10 Minutes:** - For the next 10 minutes, Sahar rests. This means there is no increase in distance (d) during this interval. Therefore, the graph should be flat (horizontal line), indicating that distance remains unchanged while time (t) continues to increase. Now, let's evaluate each provided graph based on these criteria: (A) Since the line given has a constant slope over the entire 20-minute interval, this implies that Sahar would have walked at a constant rate for this whole period. However, it does not account for his resting period. (B) The part of the graph from 0 to 10 minutes is non-linear, implying Sahar was not walking at a constant rate. Instead, it suggests that the walking rate was increasing during this interval. The segment from the 10-minute point onward is flat, indicating he was resting. This scenario does not align with the description of constant walking followed by resting. (C) The graph is flat from 0 to 10 minutes, implying Sahar was resting initially. From the 10-minute point onward, the graph shows a negative but constant slope. This suggests he was returning at a constant rate. However, this is not consistent with the given problem where he was walking first and then resting. (D) This graph correctly shows an initial linear increase in distance for the first 10 minutes, followed by a horizontal line for the next 10 minutes. The initial segment indicates walking at a constant rate, and the flat segment indicates resting, matching Sahar's described activity. (E) This graph implies that Sahar was resting for the first 10 minutes, followed by walking at a gradually decreasing rate for the next 10 minutes.

To ensure the coefficient of x is positive, as required, we multiply the entire equation by -1, resulting in: [2x - y + 3z - D = 0.] Next, we substitute the point (1,4,-2) into this equation to find the value of D. Substituting x = 1, y = 4, and z = -2 gives us: [2(1) - 4 + 3(-2) - D = 0.] Simplifying this, we get: [2 - 4 - 6 - D = 0 implies -8 - D = 0.] Solving for D, we find D = -8.

Since we know one intersection point is C(1,0), by symmetry of the parabola, x' + 1 = 2h. - Solving for x' gives x' = 2h - 1. - Given m < 0 < n, the parabola must intersect the x-axis between x=-3 and x=-1, so -3 < 2h - 1 < -1. - Solving the inequalities for h gives -1 < h < 0. Therefore, the abscissa of the other intersection point is boxed{2h-1}, and the range of values for h is boxed{-1 < h < 0}. ② For the area of triangle ABC, - Given a=-1, the equation becomes y=-(x-h)^2+k. - Substituting C(1,0) into the equation gives -(1-h)^2 + k = 0, so k = (1-h)^2. - Substituting A(-3,m) and B(-1,n) gives a system of equations: m = -(3+h)^2 + (1-h)^2 and n = -(1+h)^2 + (1-h)^2. - Solving this system gives m = -8 - 8h and n = -4h. - The equation of line AB can be found by solving the system of equations given by the coordinates of A and B in terms of k' and b, yielding k' = 4 + 2h and b = 4 - 2h. - The equation of line AB is thus y = (4 + 2h)x + 4 - 2h. - The distance CD can be calculated as CD = 1 - frac{h-2}{h+2} = frac{4}{h+2}. - The area of triangle ABC is the sum of the areas of triangle ACD and triangle BCD, which equals 8. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is boxed{8}. ③ For the constant value of x_1 + x_2 - x_3, - By symmetry of the parabola, x_1 + x_2 = 2h. - The equation of line BC is y = -2ahx + 2ah. - When y = h^2, x_3 = frac{2a-h}{2a}. - Therefore, x_1 + x_2 - x_3 = 2h - frac{2a-h}{2a} = (2 + frac{1}{2a})h - 1. - For x_1 + x_2 - x_3 to be a constant, we need 2 + frac{1}{2a} = 0, which gives a = -frac{1}{4}. - Thus, when a = -frac{1}{4}, x_1 + x_2 - x_3 = -1 is a constant. Therefore, there exists a value of a such that x_1 + x_2 - x_3 is always a constant, and that value is boxed{-frac{1}{4}}."},{"prompt":"There are 90 children in a chess club.

D: l_{1} and l_{2} are parallel because their slopes are equal.","completion":"To understand why option A is the correct choice, let's break down the reasoning step-by-step: 1. **Understanding Regression Lines**: A regression line in statistics is the line that best fits a set of data points. Its purpose is to show the relationship between two variables. By definition, a regression line will always pass through the mean (average) of the observed x-values and the mean (average) of the observed y-values. This is a key property used in solving this problem. 2. **Given Data Points**: According to the problem, both students A and B have conducted experiments and obtained their respective sets of data. Importantly, it is given that the average value of variable x for both sets of data is s, and the average value of variable y is t. This means that the point (s, t) represents the mean of both sets of observed data. 3. **Location of Regression Lines**: Based on the property of regression lines mentioned in step 1, we know that the regression line l_1 obtained by student A and the regression line l_2 obtained by student B must both pass through their respective data's mean point. Given that the mean points for both datasets are the same, namely (s, t), both l_1 and l_2 must pass through this common point. 4. **Intersection and Slope Considerations**: The fact that both regression lines pass through (s, t) guarantees their intersection at this point. However, the slopes of these two lines are determined by the variations in their respective datasets. The problem statement does not provide any information suggesting that the slopes of l_1 and l_2 have to be equal or related in any specific way. Thus, while we know for sure they intersect at (s, t), we cannot conclude anything about their slopes being equal (which would make them either parallel or coincident for all points, not just (s, t)). 5. **Conclusion**: Given the analysis in steps 1-4, it becomes clear that option A is correct: l_1 and l_2 have a common point (s,t). This is a direct consequence of the regression lines' property to pass through the mean of their datasets. Options B, C, and D propose scenarios that are not supported by the provided information or are too broad given the specific property of regression lines intersecting at the mean of their datasets.

To determine when the expression is negative, we need to consider the contributions of each term. Notice that the powers of 5 increase rapidly: [ 5 < 5^2 < 5^3 < 5^4 < 5^5 < 5^6 ] This implies that the term with the highest power of 5 will dominate the sum. 3. The expression will be negative if the last nonzero coefficient (a_i) is (-1). This is because the term with the highest power of 5 will have the largest magnitude and will determine the sign of the sum. 4.

Let's break down the key concepts and the steps involved in the process. 1. **Card Set and Elements**: - We have a set of 1024 cards. Each card contains a unique combination of numbers. - These combinations are such that any two sets of cards are different, and one of the cards is empty. 2. **Game Mechanics**: - Two players take turns picking one card at a time until all cards are taken. - After picking all cards, each player checks if they can discard a card so that each of the 10 numbers appears on an odd number of the remaining cards. If a player can do this and the other cannot, they win. If both can or neither can, it is a tie. 3. **Mathematical Representation**: - Any k cards C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k can be represented using a symmetric difference operation triangle, which includes elements that appear in an odd number of sets. 4. **Objective**: - We need to formulate a strategy for mathscr{F} in the first round in such a way that mathscr{F} can ensure a win. # Key Mathematical Observations: - Every number appears on precisely 512 cards. - The total symmetric difference of all cards for each player must be the same set, denoted as C. - If one player's total symmetric difference is C while the other's is not, the player with the total can guarantee winning by discarding C. # Proposed Strategy: Consider breaking down the card sets into pairing of the form (X, X triangle B), where B is a specific non-empty card. The key insight is developing a strategy where each player can only choose from these paired sets in a structured manner. 1. **Initial Advantage**: - Suppose mathscr{F} picks a non-empty card A in the first move. - Depending on mathscr{S}'s first card, mathscr{F} can then always pick the card from the remaining structured pairs (X, X triangle B) to ensure certain conditions. 2. **Parity and Symmetry**: - The construction (X, X triangle B) allows for tracking of symmetrical differences. - If each player's choices are bound to pairs (X, X triangle B), mathscr{F} can keep ensuring that the remaining cards maintain consistency with mathscr{F} always holding the pivotal symmetric difference C needed for ensuring a win. # Winning Strategy Proof: Case 1: mathscr{S} picks a non-empty card, say B - mathscr{F} responds with A triangle B, forcing mathscr{S} into pairs (X, X triangle B). - At each turn, if mathscr{S} picks from one pair, mathscr{F} picks the other. - Eventually, mathscr{F} can ensure the total symmetric difference on their side remains consistent with having the combination C, allowing them to discard a card for the win. Case 2: mathscr{S} picks the empty card varnothing - mathscr{F} picks any non-empty card B and keeps following the strategy of ensuring symmetrical differences using pairs. - The empty card does not change parity, and the same counting logic applies. # Conclusion: Adhering to this strategy ensures mathscr{F} either wins or at least avoids a tie by maintaining control over the symmetric difference totals through careful selection aligned with the pairing principle (X, X triangle B).

This is because translations and rotations preserve orientation, while reflection changes the orientation. 3. **Triangulation of the Polygon**: We can split one of the domains into a finite number of triangles by cutting it through some diagonals of the polygon.

To determine monotonicity: - For x > e, f'(x) > 0, indicating f(x) is increasing. - For 0 < x < e, f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is decreasing. Therefore, f(x) attains its minimum value at x=e. Calculating f(e) gives: f(e) = ln e + frac{e}{e} = 1 + 1 = 2. Thus, the function is monotonically increasing for x > e, decreasing for 0 < x < e, and has a minimum value of boxed{2} at x=e.

For g(x) to be decreasing, g'(x) leq 0 for all x > 0. This implies: frac{x-k}{x^2} - 1 leq 0 implies k geq x - x^2. 4. **Finding the Range of k**: Since x - x^2 = -(x-frac{1}{2})^2 + frac{1}{4} leq frac{1}{4} for all x in (0, +infty), we have k geq frac{1}{4}.

This can be represented by choosing k elements from {1, 2, ..., 20-k+1} since subtracting i-1 from the i-th element ensures the non-consecutiveness. Thus, for each k, the number of ways is binom{20-k+1}{k}. 2. **Apply the second condition**: We need to ensure that no element of the subset is less than k. This means that we start choosing from k.

Thus, g = -(-2/2) = 1 and f = -(4/2) = -2.

After hiring the additional male workers, the total number of employees became E + M, and the number of female workers remained the same (since only male workers were added). The new percentage of female workers is 55%, so we can write the equation: 0.60E = 0.55(E + M) We also know that after hiring the additional male workers, the company had 312 employees, so: E + M = 312 Now we have a system of two equations: 1) 0.60E = 0.55(E + M) 2) E + M = 312 Let's solve the first equation for M: 0.60E = 0.55E + 0.55M 0.60E - 0.55E = 0.55M 0.05E = 0.55M M = (0.05E) / 0.55 M = E / 11 Now we can substitute M = E / 11 into the second equation: E + (E / 11) = 312 11E + E = 312 * 11 12E = 312 * 11 E = (312 * 11) / 12 E = 312 * (11 / 12) E = 312 * (0.9167) E = 286 (approximately) Now that we have the original number of employees (E), we can find the number of additional male workers (M) by substituting E back into the equation M = E / 11: M = 286 / 11 M = 26 So, the company hired boxed{26} additional male workers."},{"prompt":"Annie is building a diorama for her history class.

The remaining three digits must be odd, and there are two possible patterns for how they can be arranged: either (odd, odd, 0) or (0, odd, odd). Therefore, there are 2 permutations for the odd digits excluding the zero. Finally, the digit 0 can only be placed in the last two places (tens or units) since we cannot start a number with 0.

Let's assume ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) are the roots of the quadratic equation induced by the conditions, i.e., [ x_1, x_2 in mathbb{N} quad text{and} quad x_1 + x_2 = S(A), quad x_1 x_2 = S(B) ] where ( S(A) ) and ( S(B) ) correspond to the sum of the subsets ( A ) and ( B ) respectively. 3.

To approach this problem in a structured way, we recall that every integer can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Thus, the representation ( x_1 + 1 ) and ( x_2 + 1 ) in binary obliges each part of the partition to have the differences split. 5. The binary interpretation of numbers that are sums of different powers of 2 becomes crucial. Let's evaluate separately how many ways we can divide these summands: 6.

The even numbers are 2 and 4, so for the first tetrahedron, there are 2 favorable outcomes. Since the outcome of the second tetrahedron does not matter for event A, it can be any of the 4 numbers.

However, since event AB represents an even number on the bottom face of the first tetrahedron and an odd number on the bottom face of the second tetrahedron, it cannot occur simultaneously with event C (both numbers being odd or even). Therefore: [P(ABC) = 0] Lastly, since event AB represents a specific combination of outcomes (e.g., the first tetrahedron showing a 2 on the bottom face and the second tetrahedron showing a 3), and events A and B can occur in various combinations, events A and B are not mutually exclusive.

The angle at (O) (central angle) is ( frac{360^circ}{5} = 72^circ ). 3. **Calculating Distance (AB)**: In the right triangle (triangle BCD) (where (BD) is the line segment from (B) perpendicular to (AD)), find (BD) using the Pythagorean theorem: [ BD = sqrt{13^2 - 5^2} = sqrt{169 - 25} = sqrt{144} = 12 , text{km} ] Since (triangle AOB) is isosceles with (AO = BO) and (AB = 2 times BD), [ AB = 2 times 12 = 24 , text{km} ] 4. **Radius of Circumscribed Circle**: The radius (OB) from the center (O) to any vertex (B) of the regular pentagon can be found using the sine rule in triangle (triangle OAB): [ OB = frac{AB}{2 sin{36^circ}} = frac{24}{2 sin{36^circ}} = frac{12}{sin{36^circ}} ] 5. **Area Calculation of the Coverage Ring**: To find the area of the ring covered by the radars, we need radii (OC) and (OE): - Radius (OD) from the center to any point (D): [ OD = frac{BD}{tan{36^circ}} = frac{12}{tan{36^circ}} ] - Adjust for the inner and outer boundaries of the ring by adding/subtracting (5) km: [ OC = OD - 5 = frac{12}{tan{36^circ}} - 5 ] [ OE = OD + 5 = frac{12}{tan{36^circ}} + 5 ] - Area of the ring: [ S_{text{кольца}} = pi left(OE^2 - OC^2right) ] Simplifying the expression for the ring area: [ S_{text{кольца}} = pi left( left(frac{12}{tan{36^circ}} + 5 right)^2 - left(frac{12}{tan{36^circ}} - 5 right)^2 right) ] Using the difference of squares formula: [ left(a + b right)^2 - left(a - b right)^2 = 4ab ] [ S_{text{кольца}} = 4 pi left( frac{12}{tan{36^circ}} cdot 5 right) = frac{240 pi}{tan{36^circ}} ] # Conclusion: The maximum distance from the center of the platform to place each radar, ensuring coverage, is: [ frac{12}{sin{36^circ}} ] The area of the coverage ring: [ frac{240 pi}{tan{36^circ}} ] (boxed{frac{12}{sin{36^circ}} , frac{240 pi}{tan{36^circ}}})"},{"prompt":"Austin needs to polish 10 pairs of dress shoes, 5 belts, and 3 watches over the weekend.

If he has already polished 45% of them, then he has polished 0.45 * 20 = 9 shoes. Therefore, he has 20 - 9 = 11 shoes left to polish. Belts: He has 5 belts and has polished 60% of them. So, he has polished 0.60 * 5 = 3 belts. Therefore, he has 5 - 3 = 2 belts left to polish. Watches: He has 3 watches and has polished 20% of them. So, he has polished 0.20 * 3 = 0.6, which we can round up to 1 watch (since he can't polish a fraction of a watch). Therefore, he has 3 - 1 = 2 watches left to polish. Now, let's calculate the time needed to polish the remaining items: Shoes: He has 11 shoes left to polish, and each takes 10 minutes. So, he needs 11 * 10 = 110 minutes for the shoes. Belts: He has 2 belts left to polish, and each takes 15 minutes. So, he needs 2 * 15 = 30 minutes for the belts. Watches: He has 2 watches left to polish, and each takes 5 minutes.

The highest power of 2 dividing ( n! ) is ( n - 1 ), which is ( 2^{n - 1} ). This matches ( 2^{n - alpha_n} ) since ( alpha_n = 1 ). - **Inductive Step:** Assume the lemma holds for ( alpha_n = k ). Consider ( m ) such that ( alpha_m = k + 1 ). Let ( m = 2^l + s ) where ( 0 < s < 2^l ). The highest power of 2 dividing ( (2^l + i) ) is the same as the highest power of 2 dividing ( i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, s ). Thus, the highest power of 2 dividing ( m! = (2^l)! (2^l + 1) cdots (2^l + s) ) is the same as the highest power of 2 dividing ( (2^l)! s! ). This is equal to ( 2^{2^l - 1} 2^{s - k} = 2^{m - (k + 1)} ). Hence, the lemma holds by induction. 2. **Transform the sum into a generating function:** Consider the function [ f(x) = frac{(e^{x/2} + e^{-x/2})^{2n}}{2^n n!}. ] Using the binomial theorem, we have [ (e^{x/2} + e^{-x/2})^{2n} = sum_{i=0}^{2n} binom{2n}{i} e^{x(n-i)}. ] Expanding ( e^{x(n-i)} ) in a Taylor series, we get [ e^{x(n-i)} = sum_{j=0}^{infty} frac{(x(n-i))^j}{j!}. ] Therefore, [ (e^{x/2} + e^{-x/2})^{2n} = sum_{i=0}^{2n} binom{2n}{i} sum_{j=0}^{infty} frac{x^j (n-i)^j}{j!}. ] 3. **Extract the coefficient of ( x^{2r} ):** We need the coefficient of ( x^{2r} ) in ( f(x) ): [ 2^n n! [x^{2r}] f(x) = sum_{i=0}^{2n} binom{2n}{i} frac{(n-i)^{2r}}{(2r)!}. ] This simplifies to [ sum_{k=-n}^{n} binom{2n}{n+k} k^{2r} = (2r)! 2^n n! [x^{2r}] f(x). ] 4. **Odd denominator of ( f^{(2r)}(0) ):** Consider [ f(x) = frac{(e^x + e^{-x} + 2)^n}{2^n n!} = frac{(cosh(x) + 1)^n}{n!}. ] Let ( T_m(x) = frac{(cosh(x) + 1)^m}{m!} ). We need to show that ( T_n^{(2r)}(0) ) has an odd denominator. Using the fact that ( T_m'(x) = T_{m-1}(x) sinh(x) ), we can show by induction that there exist polynomials ( H_{m,k,j} ) with integer coefficients such that [ T_m^{(k)}(x) = sum_{j=0}^{m} H_{m,k,j}(sinh(x), cosh(x)) T_j(x). ] Evaluating at ( x = 0 ), [ T_n^{(2r)}(0) = sum_{j=0}^{n} H_{n,2r,j}(0,1) frac{2^j}{j!}. ] Since ( H_{n,2r,j}(0,1) ) are integers, ( T_n^{(2r)}(0) ) has an odd denominator. 5. **Conclusion:** Since ( f^{(2r)}(0) ) has an odd denominator, we have [ frac{1}{2^n n!} sum_{k=-n}^{n} binom{2n}{n+k} k^{2r} = f^{(2r)}(0) ] also has an odd denominator.

To find the maximum value of varphi, we follow these steps: 1. **Identify the period of f(x) for the minimum length of AB**: Given that the minimum length of AB is frac{pi}{3}, we can deduce the period of the tangent function, which is given by T = frac{pi}{omega}. Thus, we get: [ T = frac{pi}{omega} = frac{pi}{3} implies omega = 3. ] Therefore, the function can be rewritten as f(x) = tan(3x - varphi). 2. **Determine the effect of shifting on f(x)**: Shifting the graph frac{pi}{12} units to the left involves replacing x with x + frac{pi}{12}, yielding: [ y = tanleft[3left(x + frac{pi}{12}right) - varphiright] = tanleft(3x + frac{pi}{4} - varphiright). ] 3. **Apply the condition for symmetry about the origin**: For the graph to be symmetric about the origin, the coefficient of x in the argument of tan should match the phase shift varphi.

Assume we have a quadrilateral (ABCD) in the plane such that (AC) is perpendicular to (BD). 2. Let (M) be the intersection point of (AC) and (BD). At point (M), we form four right-angled triangles.

Simplifying this equation by canceling out common terms and rearranging, we obtain: [ (a - c)(x_2 - x_1) = 0 ] 8. Since (A') and (C') are distinct points, (a neq c). Therefore, the equation implies that: [ x_2 - x_1 = 0 implies x_2 = x_1 ] 9. This result shows that the line segment (B'D') is vertical (parallel to the (y)-axis).

Delta =(2k^{2}+4)^{2}-4k^{4}=16k^{2}+16 > 0 Since line l_{1} intersects curve E at points C, D, we have x_{1}+x_{2}=2+ dfrac {4}{k^{2}}, y_{1}+y_{2}=k(x_{1}+x_{2}-2)= dfrac {4}{k}. Thus, the coordinates of point P are left(1+ dfrac {2}{k^{2}}, dfrac {2}{k}right). Given that the slope of line l_{2} is - dfrac {1}{k}, similarly, we find the coordinates of point Q to be left(1+2k^{2},-2kright). When kneq ±1, we have 1+ dfrac {2}{k^{2}}neq 1+2k^{2}, at this time the slope of line PQ is k_{PQ}= dfrac { dfrac {2}{k}+2k}{1+ dfrac {2}{k^{2}}-1-2k^{2}}= dfrac {k}{1-k^{2}}. Therefore, the equation of line PQ is y+2k= dfrac {k}{1-k^{2}}(x-1-2k^{2}), simplifying to yk^{2}+(x-3)k-y=0. Hence, line PQ always passes through the fixed point (3,0); When k=±1, the equation of line PQ is x=3, which also passes through point (3,0). In conclusion, line PQ always passes through the fixed point (3,0). boxed{(3,0)}"},{"prompt":"What is the smallest digit not found in the units place of an odd number?","completion":"An odd number has units digits that typically result in the number not being divisible by 2.

Since (kP + Q > 0), we conclude: [ k + AkP + AQ in mathbf{N}^* ] which implies ((ka + b)(1 + P)' in S). 12.

It lies on the circumcircle of triangle ( ABC ) because the reflection of the orthocenter over any side lies on the circumcircle due to the symmetry properties of the pedal triangle. 2. **Reflecting across other sides:** - Similarly, reflections of (H) across sides ( AC ) and ( AB ) (denoted as ( H^{*}_{A} ) and ( H^{*}_{B} )) must also lie on the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) by similar arguments. Therefore, the symmetrics of (H) in respect to the sides of ( triangle ABC ) lie on its circumcircle. blacksquare Part (c): 1. **Symmetry about midpoints:** - Let’s reflect (H) about the midpoint of one of the triangle's sides, say (M_{BC}) the midpoint of ( BC ). - The reflected point at ( M ) lies on the nine-point circle of (triangle ABC), which passes through the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ). 2. **Reflecting about other midpoints:** - Simultaneously reflecting about ( M_{CA} ) and ( M_{AB} ) will also yield points respectively inside the circumcircle of (triangle ABC ).

Both players draw one card each, so initially, any of these numbers could be in their hands. 2. **Player A's Statement Analysis:** Player A, after looking at their card, says, \\"I don't know whose number is larger.\\" This statement immediately rules out the numbers 1 and 5 for player A. If player A had a 1, they would know for sure that player B's number is larger. Similarly, if they had a 5, they would know their number is the largest. Therefore, the possible numbers for player A are 2, 3, or 4. 3. **Player B's Reasoning:** After hearing player A's statement, player B also states, \\"I also don't know whose number is larger.\\" This gives us further information. If player B had a 1, they would know that their number is smaller. If they had a 5, they would know their number is larger. Since player B is unsure, they cannot have 1 or 5. However, knowing that player A's card could be 2, 3, or 4, and player B still can't determine whose number is larger, player B cannot have 2 or 4 either.

Now, let's group terms: [ frac{1}{n+1} sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{k} - frac{1}{n} sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{k} = left(frac{1}{n+1} - frac{1}{n+2}right) sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{k} + frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)} ] 7.

Since (sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{k}) is greater than 1 for (n geq 2), we get: [ frac{1}{2}left(a_{n} - a_{n-1}right) > 0 ] 10.

For the square root to be defined, the expression under the square root, x^2-1, must be greater than or equal to 0.

The correct interpretation involves understanding that the set A defines the domain of x values for which the function y=sqrt{x^2-1} is defined, and set B defines the range of y values that the function can take. Given the correct interpretation that both A and B essentially describe the conditions under which the function y=sqrt{x^2-1} is defined and the values it can take, we focus on the domain (set A) since it directly relates to the x values. From the analysis in Step 1, A includes all x values such that x geq 1 or x leq -1. This is the domain of the function where it is defined and produces non-negative y values, which aligns with the condition for set B.

The area (A_{Delta}) of an equilateral triangle with side length (a) is given by: [ A_{Delta} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 ] Set the area equal to 1: [ frac{sqrt{3}}{4}a^2 = 1 ] Solve for (a): [ a^2 = frac{4}{sqrt{3}} ] [ a = sqrt{frac{4}{sqrt{3}}} = 2 sqrt{frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} = 2 sqrt{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}} ] 4. **Assess the Side Length against the Given Condition:** Calculate (2 sqrt{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}}): [ 2 sqrt{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}} = 2 sqrt{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}} = 2 times sqrt{frac{1.732}{3}} ] Since (frac{1.732}{3} approx 0.577), we find: [ 2 times sqrt{0.577} approx 2 times 0.76 = 1.52 quad (text{Note: side length is indeed greater than } 1) ] 5. **Conclusion:** Since the calculated possible side length for the equilateral triangle fits the condition (greater than 1), and given that the configuration of the division of square parts is not restricted to one specific layout and can vary, Therefore, there are infinitely many ways to place such a triangle within the divided parts, since there is no limit to their position within any of the four parts.

Thus, the 4 cells covered by the L-shape will include 2 even numbers and 2 odd numbers. 6. Sum of the cells in the L-shape: - The sum of two even numbers and two odd numbers is even. - Let the even numbers be (a) and (b), and the odd numbers be (c) and (d). - Sum: (a + b + c + d) - Both (a + b) (sum of two even numbers) is even, and (c + d) (sum of two odd numbers) is even. - Thus: [ (a + b) + (c + d) = text{even} + text{even} = text{even} ] 7.

Let g(t)=t-tln t-1 (t > 0) Then g′(t)=-ln t, Setting g′(t)=-ln t=0, we get t=1. When 0 < t < 1, f′(t) > 0, so f(t) is monotonically increasing in (0,1); When t > 1, f′(t) < 0, so f(t) is monotonically decreasing in (1,+infty); When t=1, the maximum value is 1. To make t-tln tgeqslant 1 hold, we have t=1, That is, m^{2}+m+1=1, Solving this gives m=0 or m=-1, Therefore, the answer is: boxed{0} or boxed{-1} Setting m^{2}+m+1=t and defining f(x)=x^{2}-2tln x-1, by differentiating and analyzing the monotonicity of the function, it can be determined that the minimum value is at x= sqrt {t}, which is t-tln tgeqslant 1. Constructing g(t)=t-tln t-1 (t > 0), and then differentiating to find the extremum of the function, it can be concluded that t=1, that is, m^{2}+m+1=1, which allows solving for the value of m.

The quadratic equation is x^{2}-2ax+a=0. Step 1: Calculate the discriminant (Delta) of the quadratic equation. The discriminant is given by Delta = b^{2} - 4ac. In our case, a=1, b=-2a, and c=a.

Compute the number of distinct strings Michel can obtain after exactly 10 operations.","completion":"We start with the initial string HMMT. Each operation transforms parts of the string as follows: - Replacing an occurrence of H with HM - Replacing an occurrence of MM with MOM - Replacing an occurrence of T with MT Given that we need to determine the number of distinct strings Michel can obtain after exactly 10 operations, we observe the following: 1. Each operation increases the length of the string. 2. The final string must retain the initial portions H and T while the middle portion changes over 10 operations. 3. The resulting string will be of the form H M x M T, where x is a string formed by some arrangement of Ms and Os. Since each operation increases the number of letters, let's determine the length of the string after 10 operations. An initial string HMMT (of length 4) will increase in size based on operations. We note: - An operation involving H or T increases the string length by 1. - An operation involving MM increases the string length by 1 as well (MM rightarrow MOM). Thus, for 10 operations on a string that began with length 4, the final string will have length: [ 4 + 10 = 14. ] This must be true considering the form HMxMT, resulting in: [ |HMxMT| = 2 + |x| + 2 = 14. ] Thus, |x| = 10. Next, we need to analyze the string x which consists only of Ms and Os without two Os being adjacent. This condition aligns with the Fibonacci sequence property where each valid sequence either ends in M or MO but not MM or OO. Let's define f(n) as the number of valid strings of length n composed of Ms and Os such that no two Os are adjacent. We observe: - Any valid string of length n+2: - Ends in M, preceded by a valid string of length n+1. - Ends in MO, preceded by a valid string of length n. Thus, the recursion relationship is formed: [ f(n+2) = f(n+1) + f(n). ] We need base cases to solve this: - For n=1: possible strings are M, O implies f(1) = 2. - For n=2: possible strings are MM, MO, OM implies f(2) = 3.

If we change the condition from seven colors and 14 beads to five colors and 10 beads, what will be the situation? 1. Prove for Seven Colors and Fourteen Beads 1. **Representation:** Let ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_7 ) be the vertices representing the seven colors. If a bead of color ( v_i ) and a bead of color ( v_j ) are in the same box (where ( i neq j )), draw an edge between vertex ( v_i ) and ( v_j ). We form a graph ( G ) with vertices ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_7 ). 2. **Graph Construction:** Since each color has 2 beads and each box contains 2 different colored beads, every vertex ( v_i ) in ( G ) will have exactly 2 edges. This means each vertex ( v_i ) has a degree of 2. 3. **Forming Cycles:** Starting at any vertex ( A ), follow an edge to vertex ( B ), and continue this process. Since each vertex has exactly 2 edges, you can only exit a vertex via the other edge once you enter it through one. Thus, you must eventually return to the starting vertex ( A ), forming a cycle. This is because each vertex contributes to exactly two edges, which ensures cycles. 4. **Cycle Identification:** Remove this cycle from ( G ) and repeat the above process with any remaining vertices. The graph ( G ) must then be composed of multiple cycles, since removing any cycle leaves vertices of degree 2 that contribute to the remaining cycles. 5. **Cycle Types:** Possible cycles in ( G ) to meet the conditions are: - A single heptagon (7-cycle) - A pentagon (5-cycle) and a 2-cycle - A quadrilateral (4-cycle) and a triangle (3-cycle) - A triangle (3-cycle) and two 2-cycles These cycles cover all configurations of vertices ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_7 ). 6. **Arrangement Confirmation:** For each configuration, provide appropriate labeling such that two beads of the same color do not appear in adjacent boxes when placed at the vertices of a heptagon. Refer to detailed labeling and arrangement as demonstrated in Figure 5 of the given solution. 7. **Conclusion:** Thus, the required arrangement at the vertices of a regular heptagon is always possible.

Each box must contain two beads of different colors. 2. **Graph Representation:** Construct a similar graph ( G ) as before. For example, let the bead pairs in each box be represented by edges ( e_1 = (v_1, v_2), e_2 = (v_2, v_3), e_3 = (v_3, v_1), e_4 = (v_4, v_5) ). 3. **Cycle and Graph Constraints:** Any placement of these five edges on the vertices of a pentagon (5-gon) fails to meet the criteria that no two adjacent vertices (boxes) at the pentagon share beads of the same color. Specifically, edges ( e_1, e_2, e_3 ) compel adjacent boxes to share beads with the same color configurations, causing contradictions. 4. **Conclusion:** Thus, it is impossible to distribute the ten beads of five colors into five boxes and place them such that any two adjacent boxes on a regular pentagon contain different colored beads.

This means that 1 mole of HCl reacts with 1 mole of AgNO3 to produce 1 mole of AgCl. Since you have 3 moles of HCl and 3 moles of AgNO3, and the reaction is a 1:1 ratio, the limiting reactant will be whichever reactant is present in the lesser amount. In this case, both reactants are present in equal amounts (3 moles each), so neither is the limiting reactant. Therefore, 3 moles of HCl will react with 3 moles of AgNO3 to produce 3 moles of AgCl.

When a = frac{1}{2}, the function becomes f(x) = xlnx - frac{1}{2}x², and its derivative is f'(x) = 1 + lnx - x. Let h(x) = 1 + lnx - x, then h'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 1 = frac{1 - x}{x}.

The maximum value of h(x) is h(1) = 0, and h(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, h(x) ≤ 0, and consequently, f'(x) ≤ 0.

To convert km/h to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 h): Relative speed in m/s = 27 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 h) Relative speed in m/s = 27 * 1000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 27000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 7.5 m/s Now, we have the relative speed in m/s and the length of the train in meters. To find the time it takes for the train to cross the man, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance to be covered is the length of the train, which is 390 meters.

We need to find the difference between the lengths of (AP) and (CP). 1. **Properties of Rhombus:** Since (ABCD) is a rhombus with (angle B = 60^circ): - Each side of the rhombus is of equal length. - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles and each diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent equilateral triangles. 2. **Equilateral Triangles Formed:** Since (angle B = 60^circ), the triangles (triangle ABC) and (triangle ACD) are equilateral. Therefore, (angle BAC = 60^circ). 3. **Rotation and Congruence:** Rotate (triangle ACP) clockwise (60^circ) around point (C) to form (triangle DCQ). - As ( angle APC = 120^circ ), it's evident that (triangle PCQ) becomes an equilateral triangle. 4. **Using Cyclic Properties:** Since (triangle PCQ) is equilateral: - (APQ) becomes a straight line. - Also, (triangle AQC cong triangle BPC). Hence, (angle AQC = angle BPC) and (ABCP) forms a cyclic quadrilateral. 5. **Relationship of Side Lengths:** Let (AP = x) and (CP = y). We note: [ BP = AP + PQ = x + y ] Given (BP = 3), we have: [ x + y = 3 ] 6. **Using the Cosine Law:** We apply the law of cosines in (triangle DPQ): [ DP^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy cos(60^circ) ] Substituting (DP = 2) and (cos(60^circ) = frac{1}{2}): [ 2^2 = x^2 + y^2 - xy Rightarrow 4 = x^2 + y^2 - xy ] 7. **System of Equations:** We now have: [ x + y = 3 quad text{(i)} ] [ x^2 + y^2 - xy = 4 quad text{(ii)} ] 8. **Solving the System:** From ((i)), square both sides: [ (x + y)^2 = 3^2 Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 9 quad text{(iii)} ] Subtract ((ii)) from ((iii)): [ (x^2 + y^2 + 2xy) - (x^2 + y^2 - xy) = 9 - 4 Rightarrow 3xy = 5 Rightarrow xy = frac{5}{3} ] 9. **Finding the Difference:** Using equation ((ii)): [ x^2 + y^2 - xy = 4 Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 - frac{5}{3} = 4 Rightarrow x^2 + y^2 = frac{12 + 5}{3} = frac{17}{3} ] 10. **Calculating (x - y):** Using ((x - y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2xy): [ (x - y)^2 = frac{17}{3} - 2 cdot frac{5}{3} = frac{17}{3} - frac{10}{3} = frac{7}{3} ] Taking the square root: [ x - y = sqrt{frac{7}{3}} = frac{sqrt{21}}{3} ] Thus, the difference between the lengths of (AP) and (CP) is: [ boxed{frac{sqrt{21}}{3}} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle PAB is formed by three tangents to circle O, and angle APB = 40^circ.

Let us consider the problem where triangle PAB is formed by three chords intersecting at point P inside a circle O. We are given angle APB = 40^circ. 2. We need to determine angle AOB. To start, we recognize the following fact about the angles formed by intersecting chords in a circle: 3. Since angle APB = 40^circ is the angle formed by the chords (PA) and (PB), the angles PAB and PBA are the angles subtended by arc AB. 4. Recall that angles subtended by the same arc in a circle are supplementary to the angle at the center. Therefore, [ angle PAB + angle PBA = 180^circ - angle APB. ] Let's compute this: [ angle PAB + angle PBA = 180^circ - 40^circ = 140^circ. ] 5. Now, considering the circle and points A and B, we have that arc overset{frown}{AB} subtends both angle AOB at the center and angle APB at the circumference: 6. The measure of the angle at the center (O), which is angle AOB, is twice the measure of the angle at the circumference (P) subtended by the same arc (as stated by the inscribed angle theorem): [ angle AOB = 2 cdot angle APB. ] 7.

The asymptotes of a hyperbola of the form frac{{x}^{2}}{{a}^{2}}-frac{{y}^{2}}{{b}^{2}}=1 are given by y=±frac{b}{a}x. Since the asymptote is perpendicular to the line with slope -frac{1}{2}, we have the relationship between the slopes of the line and the asymptote as -frac{1}{2}⋅frac{b}{a}=-1. Solving this equation gives us frac{b}{a}=2. Therefore, the equations of the asymptotes of hyperbola C are y=±2x, which can also be written as 2xpm y=0. Given that the distance from the right vertex (a,0) to this asymptote is frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}, we use the formula for the distance from a point to a line to find a. The distance formula gives us frac{|2a+0|}{sqrt{2^2+1^2}}=frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}. Simplifying this equation, we find that a=1. Since we already know that frac{b}{a}=2, substituting a=1 gives us b=2.

The slope of the line l, denoted as k, can be related to the coordinates of A and B. Since the line l is not perpendicular to the x-axis (as that would contradict the given conditions), we can use the properties of the hyperbola and the midpoint to find k. We have the equations of the hyperbola at points A and B as {x}_{1}^{2}-frac{{y}_{1}^{2}}{4}=1 and {x}_{2}^{2}-frac{{y}_{2}^{2}}{4}=1. Subtracting these equations gives us ({x}_{1}^{2}-{x}_{2}^{2})-frac{{y}_{1}^{2}-{y}_{2}^{2}}{4}=0.

Given x_1+x_2=6 and y_1+y_2=4, we substitute these values into the equation to find the slope k. This gives us frac{4}{6}⋅k=4, which simplifies to k=6.

Thus, the probability no two birch trees are adjacent is: [ frac{{10 choose 6}}{{15 choose 6}} = frac{210}{5005} ] This fraction further simplifies to: [ frac{210}{5005} = frac{6}{143} ] Hence, we have m = 6 and n = 143: [ boxed{149} ]"},{"prompt":"A point A(m,2) can always be used to draw two tangent lines to the circle (x+1)^2+(y2)^2=4.

After each step, the new sum of squares (doubling each time) is still not divisible by 2m. Therefore, after a finite number of steps, the numbers cannot remain consecutive (since the consecutive nature implies a specific structure and spacing that impacts their squares' sum, which conflicts with the divisors' properties established). 6. **Conclusion:** The sum of squares of these transformed numbers increases by a factor of 2 with each operation. Since at every step, the resultant sum remains divisible by m but not by 2m, the transformed numbers can never revert to a sequence of 2n consecutive integers because such a sequence would have a different sum of squares characteristic inconsistent with the established periodic division properties.

For the sum of distances to be minimal, this occurs when point X lies on the line segment between points -1 and 2. This is because any point outside this segment would increase the distance to one of the points, -1 or 2, while decreasing the distance to the other by a lesser amount resulting in a net increase in the sum of distances.

This condition can be formulated mathematically as: [ a_{ij} (b_i + c_j) leq 0 ] 4. **Step 4: Consider specific case analysis** Consider the impacts when a_{ij} = 1 and a_{ij} = -1: - If a_{ij} = 1, the condition simplifies to b_i + c_j leq 0. - If a_{ij} = -1, the condition simplifies to b_i + c_j geq 0.

The tangent from ( O_C ) to circle ( A ) or ( B ) will intersect beyond the simple geometric midpoint, forming right triangles between centers and intersection points. 3. **Calculate the Intersection Area and Desired Area**: - The triangular area ( O_CM'M ) under the radial segment ( M'M ) is (frac{1}{2} times 2 times 2 = 2) (base ( times ) height because it's right-angled at ( M )). - The sector of circle ( C ) from ( M ) to ( M' ) subtends an angle of ( 90^circ ), making its area (frac{1}{2} times frac{pi times (2)^2}{4} = pi). - Each segment within ( C ) but outside ( A ) and ( B ) (quarter-circle minus triangle) is then ((frac{pi}{2} - 2)), and with two such segments, we have (pi - 4). 4. **Total Area inside ( C ) but outside ( A ) and ( B )**: [ text{Area of circle } C = pi times 2^2 = 4pi ] [ text{Area outside } A text{ and } B text{ within } C = 4pi - (pi - 4) = 3pi + 4 ] 5. **Conclusion**: The area inside circle ( C ) but outside circles ( A ) and ( B ) is (3pi + 4).

Since {a_{n}} is an arithmetic sequence, let's denote the first term by a_{1} and the common difference by d. 3. **Formulate Equations**: From the properties of an arithmetic sequence, we can express the given conditions as equations: - From a_{5} - a_{3} = 2, knowing that a_{5} = a_{1} + 4d and a_{3} = a_{1} + 2d, we get: [ (a_{1} + 4d) - (a_{1} + 2d) = 2 implies 2d = 2 ] - From S_{2} = 2, and knowing that the sum of the first two terms of an arithmetic sequence is S_{2} = 2a_{1} + d, we get: [ 2a_{1} + d = 2 ] 4. **Solve the System of Equations**: Solving the system of equations left{begin{array}{l}2d=22a_{1}+d=2end{array}right., we find: - From 2d = 2, we get d = 1. - Substituting d = 1 into 2a_{1} + d = 2, we get 2a_{1} + 1 = 2 implies 2a_{1} = 1 implies a_{1} = frac{1}{2}. 5. **Find a_{9}**: Now that we have a_{1} = frac{1}{2} and d = 1, we can find a_{9}: [ a_{9} = a_{1} + 8d = frac{1}{2} + 8 times 1 = frac{1}{2} + 8 = frac{17}{2} ] Therefore, the answer is boxed{frac{17}{2}}, which corresponds to choice B."},{"prompt":"Let the first term of a geometric sequence be 2, and let the second term be 70.

That is, Valha can arrange these N-1 cards correctly on the table by paying no more than x rubles. - **Induction Step:** We need to prove the principle for N leq 3^k. Valha should determine the precise position for the N-th card relative to cards placed at positions left[frac{N}{3}right] and left[frac{2N}{3}right], between cards A and B. Since cards A and B divide other arranged cards into three segments, Valha needs 1 ruble first to determine in which segment the N-th card belongs. Each segment contains at most 3^{k-1}-1 cards. According to the induction hypothesis, arranging up to 3^{k-1}-1 cards costs no more than k-1 rubles. Therefore, the total cost for placing the N-th card correctly is 1 + k-1 = k rubles.

From the definition of variance: [ S^2 = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - bar{x})^2 ] Using triangular inequality and properties of the median, we note: [ |bar{x} - m| = left| frac{1}{n}sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - m) right| leq frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - m| ] The mean deviation from the median cannot exceed the mean deviation from the mean: [ frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - m| leq sqrt{ frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - bar{x})^2 } = sqrt{S^2} ] 5. **Conclusion**: Since sqrt{S^2} should logically denote the standard deviation, the presence of an inconsistency suggests one of the recorded values or the calculations was incorrect: [ (bar{x} - m)^2 leq S^2 implies (0-4)^2 leq 15.917 implies 16 leq 15.917 ] This incorrect inequality confirms the mathematics teacher's suspicion that Ivanov made a mistake.

Once the key to the 5000 box is correctly assigned, there are two keys left and two boxes left. The contestant now has a 1 in 2 chance of assigning the correct key to the 500 box. To find the overall probability of winning more than 5000, we multiply the probabilities of these independent events: Probability of assigning the correct key to the 5000 box = 1/3 Probability of assigning the correct key to the 500 box (after the 5000 box is opened) = 1/2 Overall probability = (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6 So, the probability that the contestant will win more than 5000 is boxed{1/6} ."},{"prompt":"Let m_1,m_2,...,m_{2013} > 1 be 2013 pairwise relatively prime positive integers and A_1,A_2,...,A_{2013} be 2013 (possibly empty) sets with A_isubseteq {1,2,...,m_i1} for i=1,2,...,2013 .

We are given ( 2013 ) pairwise relatively prime positive integers ( m_1, m_2, ldots, m_{2013} ) with ( m_i > 1 ) for all ( i ). Additionally, we have ( 2013 ) sets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2013} ) where ( A_i subseteq {1, 2, ldots, m_i - 1} ). We need to prove that there exists a positive integer ( N ) such that: [ N le left( 2|A_1| + 1 right)left( 2|A_2| + 1 right)cdotsleft( 2|A_{2013}| + 1 right) ] and for each ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 2013 ), there does not exist ( a in A_i ) such that ( m_i ) divides ( N - a ). 2. **Define bad numbers:** Call a number ( k ) as *( i )-bad* if ( k ) is congruent to some value in ( A_i ) modulo ( m_i ). We aim to find the smallest ( N ) such that ( N + 1 ) is neither ( 1 )-bad, nor ( 2 )-bad, ..., nor ( n )-bad. This means each of ( 1, 2, ldots, N ) is at least one of ( 1 )-bad, or ( 2 )-bad, ..., or ( n )-bad. 3. **Use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE):** Let ( S_i ) be the set of numbers in ( 1, ldots, N ) that are ( i )-bad. By PIE, we have: [ N = |S_1 cup S_2 cup cdots cup S_n| = sum |S_i| - sum |S_i cap S_j| + sum |S_i cap S_j cap S_k| - cdots ] 4. **Estimate the size of intersections:** For any indices ( i_1, ldots, i_c ), we have: [ |S_{i_1} cap cdots cap S_{i_c}| in |A_{i_1}| cdot ldots cdot |A_{i_c}| cdot left[ leftlfloor frac{N}{m_{i_1} cdots m_{i_c}} rightrfloor, leftlfloor frac{N}{m_{i_1} cdots m_{i_c}} rightrfloor + 1 right] ] This follows from the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). 5. **Upper bound ( N ):** Using the bounds from the previous step, we get: [ N le sum left( frac{N}{m_i} + 1 right) |A_i| - sum left( frac{N}{m_i m_j} - 1 right) |A_i| cdot |A_j| + cdots ] Simplifying, we have: [ N le N left[ 1 + left( frac{|A_1|}{m_1} - 1 right) cdots left( frac{|A_n|}{m_n} - 1 right) right] + (|A_1| + 1) cdots (|A_n| + 1) - 1 ] Subtracting ( N ) from both sides and rearranging, we get: [ N le frac{(|A_1| + 1) cdots (|A_n| + 1) - 1}{left( 1 - frac{|A_1|}{m_1} right) cdots left( 1 - frac{|A_n|}{m_n} right)} ] 6. **Case analysis:** - **Case 1:** ( 2|A_i| + 1 le m_i ) for all ( i ). Then: [ frac{|A_i| + 1}{1 - frac{|A_i|}{m_i}} le 2|A_i| + 1 ] Thus: [ N le (2|A_1| + 1) cdots (2|A_n| + 1) - 1 ] Hence, ( N + 1 le prod (2|A_i| + 1) ). - **Case 2:** ( 2|A_i| + 1 > m_i ) for some ( i ). Remove this ( i ) and induct down. Essentially, we can ignore the ( mod m_i ) condition and use the CRT to add the restriction that they are all non-( i )-bad modulo ( m_i ).

This implies that (r) could be close to (1) or (-1) depending on whether the relationship is positive or negative. Thus, the statement (①) is incorrect as it does not account for negative correlation. For (②), the regression line indeed passes through the center ((overline{x}, overline{y})) of the sample points. This is because the coefficients of the regression line are calculated to minimize the sum of squared deviations from the line, which involves the means of the variables. Hence, statement (②) is correct. For (③), with the linear regression equation (hat{y} = 0.2x + 10), if we plug in (x = 10), we get (hat{y} = 0.2 times 10 + 10 = 12). However, this predicts the expected value of (y) for (x = 10), and the actual (y) in the sample data could vary around this prediction due to random error. Therefore, the statement (③) is incorrect because it asserts a certainty that is not guaranteed in regression analysis. For (④), the coefficient of determination (R^2) indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A larger (R^2) value indeed suggests a closer fit of the regression line to the data, which corresponds to smaller residuals. Therefore, statement (④) is correct.

Note that after this removal, the problem’s conditions will still hold for the reduced board. Let’s denote the size of the reduced board by n times m where all rows and columns contain at least one black cell. 2. **Placing Red and Blue Chips:** Given that in every row that contains black cells, there are an odd number of black cells, place a red chip in the median black cell. Similarly, in every column that contains black cells, place a blue chip in the median black cell. 3. **Analyzing Chip Placement:** Notice that: - The n rows will have exactly n red chips and all these red chips must be in different columns (since each red chip is placed in the median black cell of a row with an odd number of black cells). - Similarly, the m columns will have exactly m blue chips and all these blue chips must be in different rows. 4. **Intermediate Conclusion on Dimensions:** Since each row’s red chip must be placed in a unique column, we have m geq n. Likewise, since each column’s blue chip must be placed in a unique row, we have n geq m. Therefore, n = m and they cover a square n times n grid, where the number of rows equals the number of columns, and the number of red chips equals the number of blue chips. 5. **Cell Crossing Argument:** Each row contains exactly one red chip, implying that each column contains exactly one red chip. Similarly, each column contains exactly one blue chip, implying that each row contains exactly one blue chip. 6. **Existence of the Desired Cell:** Therefore, considering any of the intersections of these red and blue chips, due to the unique placement in rows and columns, there must be one cell where a blue chip and a red chip coincide. Concretely, if we take the top row, which has a blue chip, then the column containing this blue chip must have its blue chip in the cell located at the same row position as the red chip of that row.

The store offers an 'x' percent discount first, so the price after the first discount is: P - (x/100) * P After applying the first discount, the store offers an additional 'y' percent discount on the new price. So the final price after both discounts is: (P - (x/100) * P) - (y/100) * (P - (x/100) * P) We know the final sale price is 55, so we can set up the equation: (P - (x/100) * P) - (y/100) * (P - (x/100) * P) = 55 Substitute P with 100: (100 - (x/100) * 100) - (y/100) * (100 - (x/100) * 100) = 55 Simplify the equation: (100 - x) - (y/100) * (100 - x) = 55 Now, let's solve for 'x' and 'y'. We have two variables and only one equation, which means there are multiple solutions to this problem. However, we can make an assumption to find one possible solution. For example, let's assume that the first discount 'x' is 30%. We can then solve for 'y'. First, calculate the price after the first discount: 100 - (30/100) * 100 = 100 - 30 = 70 Now, we know that the second discount 'y' percent of 70 brings the price down to 55. So we can set up the equation: 70 - (y/100) * 70 = 55 Solve for 'y': 70 - 0.7y = 55 0.7y = 70 - 55 0.7y = 15 y = 15 / 0.7 y = 21.43 (approximately) So, if the first discount 'x' is 30%, the second discount 'y' would be approximately 21.43%. To find the overall percentage decrease, we can use the final sale price and the original price: Overall percentage decrease = ((Original Price - Final Sale Price) / Original Price) * 100 Overall percentage decrease = ((100 - 55) / 100) * 100 Overall percentage decrease = (45 / 100) * 100 Overall percentage decrease = 45% So, the overall percentage decrease in price is boxed{45%} ."},{"prompt":"w many ways can Jason sit with his 5 friends in a row of 6 seats with an aisle on either side of the row, if Jason insists on sitting next to one of the aisles, and his friends Alice and Bob refuse to sit next to each other, while friends Carol and David must sit together?","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Jason insists on sitting next to one of the aisles. Since there are aisles on either side of the row, there are 2 possible seats for Jason. 2. Carol and David must sit together. We can treat Carol and David as a single unit for now, which means we have 4 units to arrange: Carol-David, Alice, Bob, and the remaining friend (let's call them Evan). 3. Alice and Bob refuse to sit next to each other. We'll have to arrange the units in such a way that Alice and Bob are not adjacent. First, let's arrange the units without considering the restriction on Alice and Bob. We have 4 units to arrange, which can be done in 4! (4 factorial) ways, which is 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways. Now, let's consider the restriction on Alice and Bob. We'll calculate the number of arrangements where Alice and Bob are sitting next to each other and subtract that from the total number of arrangements. If Alice and Bob are sitting next to each other, we can treat them as a single unit. Now we have 3 units to arrange: Alice-Bob, Carol-David, and Evan. These 3 units can be arranged in 3! (3 factorial) ways, which is 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways. However, within the Alice-Bob unit, Alice and Bob can switch places, so we need to multiply by 2 for the different arrangements of Alice and Bob within their unit. This gives us 6 × 2 = 12 ways where Alice and Bob are next to each other. Subtracting the arrangements where Alice and Bob are next to each other from the total number of arrangements, we get 24 - 12 = 12 ways to arrange the units with the restrictions.

Identify the symmetric center of f(x): Given the form -1 + frac{2}{1+x}, we see that the function has a symmetric center at (-1, -1). This is because shifting the graph of f(x) one unit to the right and one unit up would align it with the origin, which is characteristic of odd functions. 3. Apply the transformations to find the odd function: To make the function odd, we need its symmetric center to be at (0,0). This is achieved by shifting f(x) one unit to the right and one unit up. The transformation that achieves this is y = f(x-1) + 1. 4. Match the transformation with the given options: The transformation y = f(x-1) + 1 corresponds to option B: f(x-1) + 1. Therefore, the function that is an odd function is f(x-1) + 1, which is option boxed{B}. This solution follows the logic of determining the symmetric center of the function and then applying graphical transformations to identify the function that becomes odd, which is centered at the origin (0,0). This approach is consistent with understanding function parity and graphical transformations, highlighting the importance of recognizing how shifts affect the symmetry of a function."},{"prompt":"Calculate: 75 times 1313 25 times 1313.","completion":"We start by using the distributive property to factor out the common term from the expression: [ 75 times 1313 - 25 times 1313 = (75 - 25) times 1313 ] This simplifies to: [ 50 times 1313 ] Calculating the multiplication gives: [ 50 times 1313 = 65750 ] Thus, the solution to the problem is boxed{65750}."},{"prompt":"f the inequality |mx^{3}ln x|geqslant 1 holds for all xin(0,1], then the range of values for the real number m is ______.","completion":"The inequality |mx^{3}-ln x|geqslant 1 holds for any xin(0,1] This is equivalent to mx^{3}-ln xgeqslant 1 or mx^{3}-ln xleqslant -1, i.e., mgeqslant frac{1+ln x}{x^{3}}, denote f(x)=frac{1+ln x}{x^{3}}, or mleqslant frac{ln x-1}{x^{3}}, denote g(x)=frac{ln x-1}{x^{3}}, f'(x)=frac{frac{1}{x}cdot x^{3}-3x^{2}(1+ln x)}{x^{6}}=frac{-2-3ln x}{x^{4}}, Solving f'(x)=frac{-2-3ln x}{x^{4}}=0, we get ln x=-frac{2}{3}, i.e., x=e^{-frac{2}{3}}, Since f(x) > 0, we get 0 < x < e^{-frac{2}{3}}, during which the function is monotonically increasing, Since f(x) < 0, we get x > e^{-frac{2}{3}}, during which the function is monotonically decreasing, Thus, when x=e^{-frac{2}{3}}, the function f(x) attains its maximum, which is also the global maximum f(e^{-frac{2}{3}})=frac{1+ln e^{-frac{2}{3}}}{(e^{-frac{2}{3}})^{3}}=frac{1-frac{2}{3}}{e^{-2}}=frac{1}{3}e^{2}, at this time mgeqslant frac{1}{3}e^{2}, If mleqslant frac{ln x-1}{x^{3}}, When x=1, frac{ln x-1}{x^{3}}=-1, Thus, when m > 0, the inequality mleqslant frac{ln x-1}{x^{3}} does not always hold, In summary, mgeqslant frac{1}{3}e^{2}.

Therefore, the game must end in at most 1994^2 moves, as no square can be revisited. 3. **Consider the principle of strategy**: - One of the players must have a winning strategy. If we can show that Player B cannot have a winning strategy under any configuration, it follows that Player A must have the winning strategy. 4. **Analyze the hypothetical scenario where Player B has a winning strategy**: - Suppose Player B has a winning strategy no matter what Player A's first move is.

Notice that if we rotate the first board by 90^circ, the game on the second board with the switched roles will exactly mimic the original game in terms of the sequence and nature of moves. 5. **Simulate the moves on both boards**: - On the first board, A makes an arbitrary first move from square x to square y. - On the second board, A places the knight on square y and waits for B's reply on the first board. - If B moves to square z on the first board, A copies this move on the second board as their own move. - This means A will make exactly the same moves on the second board as Player B would by vertical-first then horizontal-second analogously. 6. **Move determination**: - Both boards independently progress with each player copying the moves from one board to the other in a mirrored fashion. - Since the knight moves (horizontal and vertical exchanges) mimic each other, each move on the second board corresponds to a valid step from the first board rotated 90^circ. 7. **Conclusion of the dual game strategy**: - If Player B could force a win on the first board starting from any configuration when A moves first, B must be able to win as A on the rotated second board. - However, because A is following the presumed perfect strategy of B, Player B's strategy on one board implies a contradictory outcome based on mirrored conditions. 8. **Result**: - Thus, B cannot claim an irrefutable winning strategy on every turn and configuration. - Therefore, A must have a winning strategy for them to rely on in such a game structure.

Thus, the center ( (h, k) ) of the circle is calculated as: [ h = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = -frac{b}{2a}, quad k = 0 ] Therefore, the center of the circle is ( left(-frac{b}{2a}, 0right) ). 5. **Radius of the Circle**: The radius ( R ) of the circle is the distance from the center to any of the intersection points.

Hence, for n=1, there is one odd subset and one even subset: [ a_1 = b_1 = 1. ] 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume for n=k, there are equal numbers of odd and even subsets: [ a_k = b_k. ] 3. **Inductive Step:** Now consider n = k+1. The set S_{k+1} = {1,2,cdots, k, k+1}. The subsets of S_{k+1} can be divided into two types: - Subsets not containing k+1 are subsets of S_k. They are divided into a_k odd subsets and b_k even subsets. - Subsets containing k+1. To form these, add k+1 to each subset of S_k: - If k+1 is even, adding k+1 does not change the parity of the sum.

We want to show that: [ 3n - 2e geq 3 ] **Step-by-Step Explanation:** 1. **Assume the graph is connected:** If G is connected, we can express the number of edges e as: [ e = n - 1 + u ] where u geq 0 is some non-negative integer. 2. **Transform the inequality:** Substitute e = n - 1 + u into the inequality 3n - 2e geq 3: [ 3n - 2(n - 1 + u) geq 3 ] Simplify the above expression: [ 3n - 2n + 2 - 2u geq 3 ] [ n - 2u + 2 geq 3 ] Which simplifies to: [ n - 1 geq 2u ] Thus, we need to show that the number of blue edges (in the spanning tree) is at least twice the number of green edges (that are part of some cycle). 3. **Color the edges:** Consider a spanning tree of G. Color the edges of the spanning tree blue, and the remaining edges green. In this configuration, every green edge must complete a triangle with two blue edges, as green edges are not part of the tree and their endpoints are connected through a path in the tree. 4. **Analyze the structure:** Each green edge together with the blue edges from the spanning tree must form exactly one triangle. This argument is valid because there are no cycles of length greater than 3 in the graph: - If a green edge forms part of a longer cycle, it contradicts the premise that our graph contains no cycles of length 4 or more. 5. **Count the triangles:** Each green edge forms a triangle with exactly two blue edges. Since each blue edge can be part of at most one such triangle (because there are no cycles of length 4 or more), the number of blue edges must be at least twice the number of green edges. 6. **Conclude for connected graphs:** This directly implies that: [ n - 1 geq 2u ] which means: [ 3n - 2e geq 3 ] for connected graphs. **Conclusion for non-connected graph:** If G is not connected, it can be represented as a union of connected components.

We will consider the elements of ( X ) as residues modulo 37. All elements must be nonzero and distinct. 2. **Using Roots of Unity:** - Let ( omega ) be a primitive 37th root of unity.

For each term ( x^m ) in the polynomial, replace it with ( x^{m mod 37} ). This polynomial has degree less than 37 but is divisible by ( x^{37} - 1 ).

Since John takes a shower every other day, he would shower on half of those days. So, he would take 28 / 2 = 14 showers in 4 weeks. We know that John uses 280 gallons of water in those 4 weeks. To find out how much water he uses per shower, we divide the total gallons by the number of showers. So, 280 gallons / 14 showers = 20 gallons per shower. Now, we need to find out how long each shower lasts. We know that his shower uses 2 gallons of water per minute.

This means that 1 mole of NH4I reacts with 1 mole of KOH to produce 1 mole of NH3, 1 mole of KI, and 1 mole of H2O. According to the problem, we have 3 moles of KOH. Since the reaction is a 1:1 ratio, we will also need 3 moles of NH4I to react with the 3 moles of KOH. Now, let's calculate the moles of NH3 formed. Since the ratio of NH4I to NH3 is 1:1, the moles of NH3 formed will be equal to the moles of NH4I reacted. Therefore, if 3 moles of NH4I are required, then 3 moles of NH3 will be formed.

Let (x_k) be the integer represented by the first (k) digits of the sequence, i.e., [ x_k^2 = sum_{i=0}^{k-1} a_{i+1} cdot 10^i. ] For large (k), consider the difference between consecutive terms: [ (x_k - x_{k-1})(x_k + x_{k-1}) = a_k cdot 10^{k-1}. ] 3. **Analyzing the Parity and Divisibility:** If (a_1 neq 5), then (5) does not divide both (x_k - x_{k-1}) and (x_k + x_{k-1}). This implies that either (5^{k-1} mid x_k + x_{k-1}) or (5^{k-1} mid x_k - x_{k-1}). Given that (x_k + x_{k-1} > x_k - x_{k-1}), we must have (5^{k-1} mid x_k + x_{k-1}). 4. **Bounding (x_k):** Since (2 mid x_k - x_{k-1}) and (2 mid x_k + x_{k-1}), we have (x_k - x_{k-1} geq 2). Thus, [ x_k = frac{(x_k - x_{k-1}) + (x_k + x_{k-1})}{2} geq frac{2 cdot 5^{k-1} + 1}{2} = 5^{k-1} + 1. ] Consequently, [ 10^k > x_k^2 > 5^{2k-2}. ] This inequality implies [ left(frac{10}{25}right)^k > frac{1}{25}, ] which is clearly false for sufficiently large (k). 5. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** The contradiction implies that our initial assumption is false. Therefore, no such sequence of nonzero digits (a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots) and positive integer (N) exists such that for every (k > N), the number (overline{a_k a_{k-1} cdots a_1}) is a perfect square.

First, let's convert the dimensions of the courtyard from meters to centimeters, since the dimension of the brick is given in centimeters. Courtyard length = 18 meters = 1800 cm Courtyard breadth = 12 meters = 1200 cm Now, let's calculate the total area of the courtyard in square centimeters: Total area = Courtyard length × Courtyard breadth Total area = 1800 cm × 1200 cm Total area = 2160000 cm² Next, we'll divide the total area by the number of bricks to find the area of one brick: Area of one brick = Total area / Number of bricks Area of one brick = 2160000 cm² / 11076.923076923076 To simplify the calculation, let's round the number of bricks to the nearest whole number, which is 11077. Area of one brick = 2160000 cm² / 11077 Area of one brick ≈ 194.999 cm² (approximately 195 cm²) Now, we know that one of the dimensions of the brick is 13 cm, so we can find the other dimension by dividing the area of one brick by this known dimension: Other dimension = Area of one brick / Known dimension Other dimension = 195 cm² / 13 cm Other dimension = 15 cm Therefore, the other dimension of the brick is approximately boxed{15} cm."},{"prompt":"The numbers (1, 2, ldots, 50) are written on a blackboard.

Since the students who passed in both subjects is 20%, the percentage of students who failed in at least one subject is 100% - 20% = 80%. Now, we know that the students who failed in both subjects are counted in both the Hindi and English failure percentages. To avoid double-counting, we subtract the percentage of students who failed in both from the Hindi and English failure percentages. Let's calculate the percentage of students who failed only in Hindi (H_only): H_only = H - B H_only = 20% - 10% H_only = 10% Now, let's denote the percentage of students who failed only in English (E_only) as X.

The tap that fills the cistern does so in 4 hours, so its rate is ( frac{1}{4} ) of the cistern per hour. The tap that empties the cistern does so in 6 hours, so its rate is ( frac{1}{6} ) of the cistern per hour. When both taps are opened simultaneously, the net rate of filling the cistern is the filling rate minus the emptying rate: [ R_{net} = R_{fill} - R_{empty} ] [ R_{net} = frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{6} ] To find a common denominator, we can use 12 (the least common multiple of 4 and 6): [ R_{net} = frac{3}{12} - frac{2}{12} ] [ R_{net} = frac{1}{12} ] This means that the net rate at which the cistern is filled is ( frac{1}{12} ) of the cistern per hour.

Hence, [ mathbf{a}_2 = frac{mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1}{3} ] Using the fact that ( mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1 = 0 ), we can write: [ mathbf{a}_2 = frac{mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1}{3} = frac{-mathbf{a}_1}{3} = -frac{1}{3} mathbf{a}_1 ] 3. **Similar Computation for Other Points:** Similarly, we define ( mathbf{b}_2, mathbf{c}_2, mathbf{d}_2 ) as follows: [ mathbf{b}_2 = frac{mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1}{3} = -frac{1}{3} mathbf{b}_1, quad mathbf{c}_2 = frac{mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{d}_1}{3} = -frac{1}{3} mathbf{c}_1, quad mathbf{d}_2 = frac{mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1}{3} = -frac{1}{3} mathbf{d}_1 ] 4. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Let's assume for some ( n in mathbb{N} ), the hypothesis holds as: [ mathbf{a}_n = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{a}_1, quad mathbf{b}_n = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{b}_1, quad mathbf{c}_n = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{c}_1, quad mathbf{d}_n = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{d}_1 ] 5. **Induction Step:** We now prove it for ( n+1 ). Using the definition again, we get: [ mathbf{a}_{n+1} = frac{mathbf{b}_n + mathbf{c}_n + mathbf{d}_n}{3} ] Substituting the inductive hypothesis, we get: [ mathbf{a}_{n+1} = frac{1}{3} left( left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{b}_1 + left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{c}_1 + left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} mathbf{d}_1 right) ] Simplifying further, [ mathbf{a}_{n+1} = frac{1}{3} left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} left( mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1 right) ] Using ( mathbf{a}_1 + mathbf{b}_1 + mathbf{c}_1 + mathbf{d}_1 = 0 ): [ mathbf{a}_{n+1} = frac{1}{3} left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n-1} (-mathbf{a}_1) = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n} mathbf{a}_1 ] 6. **Extension to Other Points:** Analogously, we can show: [ mathbf{b}_{n+1} = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n} mathbf{b}_1, quad mathbf{c}_{n+1} = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n} mathbf{c}_1, quad mathbf{d}_{n+1} = left(-frac{1}{3}right)^{n} mathbf{d}_1 ] 7. **Conclusion:** The lengths of vectors ( mathbf{a}_n, mathbf{b}_n, mathbf{c}_n, mathbf{d}_n ) decrease exponentially, specifically as ( left( frac{1}{3} right)^{n-1} ). Therefore, after a finite number of steps, all points ( A_n ) will eventually lie within the unit circle centered at ( S ). Thus, only a finite number of points from the sequence ( A_n ) can lie outside the circle.

Define the sequence ( {a_n} ) by ( a_1 = 0 ) and ( a_{n+1} = f(a_n) ) for all positive integers ( n ). 2. **Elementary Property of Integer Polynomials:** From the elementary property of integer polynomials, we know that if ( a ) and ( b ) are integers, then ( a - b mid f(a) - f(b) ). 3. **Applying the Property to the Sequence:** For the sequence ( {a_n} ), we have: [ a_{i+1} = f(a_i) quad text{and} quad a_{i+2} = f(a_{i+1}) ] By the property, ( a_{i+1} - a_i mid f(a_{i+1}) - f(a_i) ), which implies: [ a_{i+1} - a_i mid a_{i+2} - a_{i+1} ] 4. **Inductive Step:** We can use induction to show that for all ( j > i ), ( a_{i+1} - a_i ) is a divisor of ( a_{j+1} - a_j ). - **Base Case:** For ( j = i+1 ), we have already shown ( a_{i+1} - a_i mid a_{i+2} - a_{i+1} ). - **Inductive Step:** Assume ( a_{i+1} - a_i mid a_{k+1} - a_k ) for some ( k geq i+1 ).

Each edge can be directed in 2 ways (either from vertex ( u ) to vertex ( v ) or from vertex ( v ) to vertex ( u )). 2. **Total Number of Possible Directed Graphs**: Since each of the ( binom{n}{2} ) edges can be directed in 2 ways, the total number of possible directed graphs is ( 2^{binom{n}{2}} ). 3. **Number of Directed Triangles**: A directed triangle is a set of three vertices ( {u, v, w} ) such that the edges between them form a cycle (e.g., ( u to v to w to u )).

However, these numbers should also remain primes upon applying the common difference repeatedly. Not all digits necessarily yield four consecutive primes when incremented by 10 over three intervals. Considering the minimal requirement and simpler check, we can use the digit 1 as the safest assumption without extensive trial. Thus, the ones digit of ( p ) can be (boxed{1}), provided there exists such a sequence of consecutive primes. For example, taking ( p = 11 ), the subsequent numbers ( p+10 = 21 ), ( p+20 = 31 ), and ( p+30 = 41 ) need to be checked for primality.
