Here, the sequence is just [1], and the number 1 is already in the first position. Thus, the hypothesis holds for ( n=1 ). 2. **Inductive Step:** - Suppose the hypothesis holds for any sequence of ( n-1 ) natural numbers. That is, for any sequence of length ( n-1 ), the process described ensures that the number 1 can be moved to the first position. - We will prove that the hypothesis also holds for any sequence of ( n ) natural numbers. 3. **Applying the Inductive Hypothesis:** - Consider the sequence ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) ). If the number ( n ) is at the last position ( a_n = n ), then we can use our hypothesis for the first ( n-1 ) numbers ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1}) ). - By the inductive hypothesis, we can rearrange ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1}) ) such that the number 1 moves to the first position with ( n ) remaining at the last position which maintains our solution as ( (1, ldots, ldots, n) ). 4. **Handling the General Case:** - If the number ( n ) is not at the last position, i.e., ( a_n neq n ), then we initiate the transformation process. This process is defined as follows: if any number ( k ) is at the first position ( a_1 ), we reverse the first ( k ) numbers in the sequence. - We continue repeating this transformation. The key observation is that after a finite number of swaps, the larger numbers will naturally gravitate toward their final positions due to the decreasing order of potential swaps possible by design. 5. **Ensuring the Number 1 Moves to Position 1:** - With repeated transformations, other numbers in the sequence will eventually stabilize in their positions except for 1. Any number other than 1 that starts in position 1 gets moved away by a subsequent swap, recursively pushing 1 towards the first position as '1' is the smallest and gets swapped the quickest and rarely displaced once it starts positioning movement. 6. **Conclusion for ( n = 1993 ):** - By induction, it implies that after a finite series of mechanical reversals and rearrangements, it is possible for the number 1 to be at the first position in the sequence of length 1993.

We'll prove this in several steps, exploring different cases based on geometric configurations. I. Geometric Analysis Let's consider the half-planes defined by their boundary lines classified into different cases: 1. **Two Parallel Lines (Case (0))** - Here, one half-plane completely covers the other one. Thus, having both is redundant. We can ignore this case as removing the redundant half-plane still leaves the task of covering the plane simplified. 2. **Intersecting Lines (Cases (1), (2), and (3))** - When two lines intersect, they create more complex configurations: - **Case (1): Wedge regions left uncovered.** - **Case (2): Strip regions left uncovered.** - **Case (3): Line (common boundary) left uncovered.** II. Adding a Third Half-Plane When introducing a third half-plane to cover the remaining uncovered regions, more configurations appear: - For Example: - **From Case (1), we get sub-cases I/a, I/b, and I/c.** - **From Case (2), we get configuration II.** - **From Case (3), we get configuration III.** In these sub-configurations, multiple boundary lines intersect at points, creating isolated uncovered regions. III. Simplification of Configurations Certain configurations can be simplified: - **Case I/c:** Where three boundary lines intersect at a single point, we can slightly adjust one half-plane to simplify it back to Case I/a. - **Case III:** By slightly shifting two half-planes with common boundaries, we can simplify back to Case II. Thus, only three main configurations need to be considered before introducing the fourth half-plane. IV. Introduction of the Fourth Half-Plane Finally, when a fourth half-plane is added: - **If Parallel to an Existing Boundary Line:** This immediately covers the remaining region completely, making one of the other half-planes redundant. - **If Non-Parallel:** Identify the point of nearest intersection (vertex of uncovered regions). The fourth half-plane along with the other two will form complete coverage of the plane. Hence, in both scenarios, three half-planes are sufficient to achieve a full coverage of the plane. Conclusion: From the above reasoning and geometrical setup, it proves that it is always possible to select three out of four half-planes to ensure they cover the entire plane. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The minimum value of the function y=(x1)^2 is ____.","completion":"The key point: Properties of quadratic functions.

Hence, we want to evaluate (1omega^0 + 2omega^1 + ldots + 2015omega^{2014}). 2. Consider the polynomial (P(x) = frac{x^{2016} - 1}{x - 1} = x^{2015} + x^{2014} + ldots + 1). Then, [ P'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( frac{x^{2016} - 1}{x - 1} right) ] Using the quotient rule, we get: [ P'(x) = frac{(2016x^{2015})(x - 1) - (x^{2016} - 1)}{(x - 1)^2} = frac{2016x^{2015}(x - 1) - (x^{2016} - 1)}{(x - 1)^2} ] Simplifying the numerator: [ P'(x) = frac{2016x^{2015}x - 2016x^{2015} - x^{2016} + 1}{(x - 1)^2} = frac{2015x^{2016} - 2016x^{2015} + 1}{(x - 1)^2} ] This simplifies to: [ P'(x) = 2015x^{2014} + 2014x^{2013} + ldots + 1 ] 3.

When we return to the first vertex, we must have: [ a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) + (-1)^n a ] Since (n) is odd, ((-1)^n = -1), so we get: [ a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) - a ] This simplifies to: [ 2a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) ] Thus, (a) can be determined as: [ a = frac{1}{2} left( sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) right) ] Therefore, for any permutation (sigma), we can always find a suitable (a), and hence it is possible for all odd (n). 2. **Case 2: ( n ) is even** When (n) is even, we obtain a similar system, but now the (a)s cancel out. We have: [ a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) + (-1)^n a ] Since (n) is even, ((-1)^n = 1), so we get: [ a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) + a ] This simplifies to: [ 0 = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) ] Therefore, we must have: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} (-1)^i sigma(i) = 0 ] Working modulo 2, this implies that (n equiv 0 pmod{4}).

So, the total amount she gets from selling the maple trees is: 24 maple trees * M = 24M Now, we know that Gloria has 150 in cash initially and she has 350 left after buying the cabin. So, the total amount she has after selling the trees and before buying the cabin is: 129,000 (price of the cabin) + 350 (remaining cash) = 129,350 We also know that she had 150 in cash before selling the trees, so the total amount she raised from selling the trees is: 129,350 (total after buying the cabin) - 150 (initial cash) = 129,200 Now, we can calculate the total amount she raised from selling all the trees, which is the sum of the amounts from cypress trees, pine trees, and maple trees: 2,000 (from cypress trees) + 120,000 (from pine trees) + 24M (from maple trees) = 129,200 Now, we can solve for M: 2,000 + 120,000 + 24M = 129,200 122,000 + 24M = 129,200 24M = 129,200 - 122,000 24M = 7,200 Now, we divide both sides by 24 to find the value of M: M = 7,200 / 24 M = 300 So, Gloria gets boxed{300} for each maple tree."},{"prompt":"f the random variable Xsim B(4,p) and E(X)=frac{4}{3}, then D(X)=______.","completion":"To solve for the variance D(X) of the random variable X which follows a binomial distribution B(n, p) with parameters n = 4 and an unknown probability p, and given that the expectation E(X) = frac{4}{3}, we proceed as follows. 1. **Find the probability p:** - The expectation of a binomially distributed random variable is given by the formula E(X) = np.

After that, it will bounce back up to a height of 0.8h (80% of the original height), then fall back down the same distance of 0.8h. This process will continue indefinitely, with the ball reaching 80% of the previous height on each bounce. To calculate the total distance covered by the ball, we need to sum the distances of all the bounces. The total distance D can be expressed as an infinite geometric series: D = h + 2(0.8h) + 2(0.8^2h) + 2(0.8^3h) + ... This is a geometric series with the first term a = h and the common ratio r = 2 * 0.8 = 1.6. However, since the ball is not bouncing back to the full height, we need to adjust the common ratio for the subsequent terms after the initial drop. The correct common ratio for the bounce distances is r = 0.8. So the series becomes: D = h + 2(0.8h) + 2(0.8^2h) + 2(0.8^3h) + ... To find the sum of this infinite geometric series, we use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, which is: S = a / (1 - r) where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio. In this case, the first term a is not just h, but h + 2(0.8h), because the first bounce up and down is included in the first term. So we have: a = h + 2(0.8h) = h + 1.6h = 2.6h The common ratio r is 0.8 (for the bounce distances). Now we can find the sum of the series: S = a / (1 - r) S = 2.6h / (1 - 0.8) S = 2.6h / 0.2 S = 13h So the total distance covered by the ball is boxed{13} times the original height h from which it was dropped."},{"prompt":"A werewolf moves on an infinitely large grid.

However, since only 200 out of 2000 students were selected, this indicates that the survey is actually a sampling survey, not a comprehensive one. A comprehensive survey would involve all 2000 students. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. - **Statement B**: This statement directly mentions that the sample size is 200.

This is a correct understanding of the term \\"population\\" in the context of statistical analysis. The population refers to the entire group that is the subject of the study, which in this case, is the 2000 students. However, the statement might be misinterpreted in the solution provided as it suggests the vision of the 2000 students is the population.

In statistical terms, each selected student can indeed be referred to as an individual or a subject of the study. However, the solution suggests that it's the vision of each student that is considered an individual. This seems to be a misunderstanding of the terminology. In the context of the survey, it would be more accurate to say that each student's vision is a data point or observation rather than calling the student an individual.

To make the function y = sin 2x resemble y = sin x, we therefore have to address the horizontal stretching caused by the factor of 2 and shift the graph horizontally so that it starts its cycle at the same point as y = sin x. The standard sine function, y = sin x, starts its cycle at x = 0. The function y = sin 2x also starts a cycle at x = 0. However, due to the stretching factor, one full cycle of y = sin 2x is completed at x = pi instead of at x = 2pi for y = sin x.

When the selling price per piece is decreased to 50 yuan, the decrease in price from the original is 60 - 50 = 10 yuan. The increase in sales volume for every 5 yuan decrease is calculated as frac{10}{5} times 10 = 2 times 10 = 20 pieces.

Since the ratio of milk to water is 2:1, we can find the original quantity of water by dividing the quantity of milk by 2: Quantity of water = Quantity of milk / 2 Quantity of water = 45 liters / 2 Quantity of water = 22.5 liters Now, we add 10 liters of water to the mixture: New quantity of water = Original quantity of water + 10 liters New quantity of water = 22.5 liters + 10 liters New quantity of water = 32.5 liters The new ratio of milk to water is therefore: Milk : Water = 45 liters : 32.5 liters To express this ratio in its simplest form, we can divide both quantities by the greatest common divisor.

To solve this problem, we first determine the range of values for the parameter m that would make both statements true. Then, using the fact that p vee q is a false statement, we find the range of values for m that would make both statements false. The common part of these two ranges is the desired solution.

According to the problem, this number is 17 times the number in the units place. Therefore, we can write the equation: [ 10a + b = 17b ] 3. Next, we simplify the equation by isolating the terms involving ( a ) on one side and those involving ( b ) on the other: [ 10a + b = 17b implies 10a = 17b - b implies 10a = 16b ] 4. We can further simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 2: [ 5a = 8b ] 5. Now, solve for ( a ) in terms of ( b ). Rearrange the equation: [ a = frac{8b}{5} ] 6. Since ( a ) and ( b ) are both digits (integers between 0 and 9), ( frac{8b}{5} ) must also be an integer. This means that ( b ) must be a multiple of 5 to ensure ( frac{8b}{5} ) is an integer. 7. The possible values for ( b ) are ( 0, 5 ). We check these one by one: - For ( b = 0 ): [ a = frac{8 times 0}{5} = 0 ] This gives us the number 00, which isn't a valid number for an apartment. - For ( b = 5 ): [ a = frac{8 times 5}{5} = 8 ] This gives us the number 85, which is valid. 8.

We need to understand its properties, particularly its sign and monotonicity. The function ( f(x) ) can be analyzed for critical points and sign changes. The derivative of ( f(x) ), which is ( f'(x) = 12x^2 + 1 ), is always positive since ( 12x^2 + 1 ) is positive for all real ( x ). Therefore: [ f'(x) > 0 quad text{for all} quad x in mathbb{R} ] This means ( f(x) ) is strictly increasing on all of ( mathbb{R} ). 2. **Analyze the sign at specific points**: Evaluate ( f(x) ) at key points to understand its behavior: [ f(0) = 4(0)^3 + 0 - 4 = -4 ] [ f(1) = 4(1)^3 + 1 - 4 = 4 + 1 - 4 = 1 ] Since ( f(x) ) is strictly increasing and it goes from negative to positive between 0 and 1, there must be a root between these points. As ( f(1) = 1 ) and it is positive right there, for ( x > 1 ), ( f(x) > 1 ). 3. **Evaluate the system of equations for a specific value**: We will test if there is a consistent solution by setting ( x = 1 ), ( y = 1 ), and ( z = 1 ): First equation: [ y^2 = 4x^3 + x - 4 implies 1^2 = 4(1)^3 + 1 - 4 implies 1 = 4 + 1 - 4 implies 1 = 1 ] Second equation: [ z^2 = 4y^3 + y - 4 implies 1^2 = 4(1)^3 + 1 - 4 implies 1 = 4 + 1 - 4 implies 1 = 1 ] Third equation: [ x^2 = 4z^3 + z - 4 implies 1^2 = 4(1)^3 + 1 - 4 implies 1 = 4 + 1 - 4 implies 1 = 1 ] 4. **Check for contradictions if ( x neq 1 )**: Suppose ( x > 1 ): The first equation becomes: [ y^2 = 4x^3 + x - 4 ] Since ( x > 1 ): [ y^2 = 4x^3 + x - 4 > x^2 ] Now, for the second equation, [ z^2 = 4y^3 + y - 4 ] If ( y > x ), then: [ z^2 = 4y^3 + y - 4 > y^2 ] Hence ( z > y ) and ( z > x ). Consequently: [ x^2 = 4z^3 + z - 4 > z^2 ] This leads to a contradiction because it implies that ( x > z ), ( y > x ), and ( z > y ), which cannot all be true simultaneously. Thus, ( x ) must not be different from 1. 5. **Check for contradictions if ( x < 1 )**: Similar logic leads to contradictions when ( x < 1 ): - Consider ( x < 1 ): [ y^2 = 4x^3 + x - 4 < x^2 ] which also leads to contradictions following the same logic as above, hence ( x ) must be equal to 1 for consistency.

We need to show that this condition is equivalent to A B C being an equilateral triangle. 2. **Basics of Rotation**: Recall that j = e^{2pi i / 3} is a complex number representing a rotation by 120^circ counterclockwise. The cube roots of unity are 1, j, j^2, where j^3 = 1 and 1+j+j^2 = 0.

Multiplying a complex number by j corresponds to rotating it by 120^circ counterclockwise. Therefore, if triangle ABC is equilateral, then the coordinates must be related through a 120^circ rotation. 4. **Equilateral Triangle Condition**: For triangle ABC to be equilateral, the rotation of 120^circ around each point should align with the other two points.

Prove that the intersecting lines pass through a single point.","completion":"**First Approach:** 1. Let the vertex of the right angle be C and the constant be denoted by k. Let a line e_1 intersecting the arms of the right angle at A_1 and B_1 be such that: [ frac{1}{C A_1} + frac{1}{C B_1} = k ] 2. Reflect the given diagram across the perpendicular bisector f of the right angle. Upon reflection, the arms of the right angle map onto each other. Let A_2 and B_2 be the points where the reflection of e_1, denoted as e_2, intersects CA_1 and CB_1, respectively. Clearly, CA_2 = CB_1 and CB_2 = CA_1. Thus, e_2 will also satisfy the given condition. 3. As a result, the intersection point M of e_1 and e_2 must be a point invariant under the reflection, as it lies on line f. Now calculate the perpendicular distance from M to the arms of the right angle. 4. Let M' be the projection of M onto CA_1. Using the similarity of the right-angled triangles A_1B_1C and A_1MM', noting that triangle CMM' is isosceles: [ frac{M'M}{CB_1} = frac{M'A_1}{CA_1} = frac{CA_1 - CM'}{CA_1} = 1 - frac{M'M}{CA_1} ] 5. Rearrange and solve using (1): [ M'Mleft( frac{1}{CA_1} + frac{1}{CB_1} right) = k cdot M'M = 1 ] Therefore, [ M'M = frac{1}{k} ] 6. Since M'M is constant and independent of the position of e_1, it follows that every line satisfying the given condition intersects the fixed point M at distance 1/k from the arms of the right angle. Hence, all such lines pass through M. Thus, the statement is proven and the constant point is determined. blacksquare **Second Approach:** 1. Consider the positive axes of a right-angled coordinate system as the arms of the right angle. Suppose the line e_1 satisfies the given condition and has the equation y = m_1 x + b_1. Then it intersects the positive Y-axis at (B_1(0, b_1)) and the positive X-axis at (A_1(a_1, 0)). 2. Given: [ frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{b_1} = k ] Using the fact that ( m_1 = -frac{b_1}{a_1} ), we rewrite the line equation in intercept form: [ y = -frac{b_1}{a_1} x + b_1 quad text{or} quad frac{x}{a_1} + frac{y}{b_1} = 1 ] 3.

Using: [ a_1 + b_1 = k a_1 b_1 quad text{and} quad a_2 + b_2 = k a_2 b_2 ] Simplify the numerators for x and y: [ a_1 a_2 b_2 - a_1 b_1 a_2 = frac{1}{k} left[ a_1(a_2 + b_2) - (a_1 + b_1)a_2 right] = frac{1}{k} (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) ] Similarly, [ b_1 b_2 a_2 - b_1 a_1 b_2 = frac{1}{k} left[ b_1(a_2 + b_2) - (a_1 + b_1)b_2 right] = frac{1}{k} (a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2) ] This simplifies to: [ x_M = frac{1}{k}, quad y_M = frac{1}{k} ] 6. Simplification was valid as a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 = 0 would imply b_2 / a_2 = b_1 / a_1, making the lines parallel and identical for valid conditions. Thus, the intersection point remains independent of specific coordinates of a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, i.e., all such lines intersect at the fixed point ( left( frac{1}{k}, frac{1}{k} right) ). Thus, the proposition is verified to be correct even when arms extend, considering negative extensions. This concludes our proof that all lines satisfying the reciprocal condition pass through a fixed point around the angle vertex. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x)=log_{2}(|x1|+|x+2|a).

The tax department collected a total of 3840 through farm tax from the village. Mr. William paid 480 as farm tax after receiving the corresponding government subsidies for his land. Calculate the percentage of total land of Mr. William over the total taxable land of the village, taking into consideration the varying tax rates based on land type and the received government subsidies.","completion":"To calculate the percentage of total land of Mr. William over the total taxable land of the village, we need to first determine the effective tax rate for each type of land after accounting for the government subsidies. Then, we can calculate the total taxable value of Mr. William's land and compare it to the total taxable value of the village's land. Let's denote the total taxable value of the village's land as V and the total taxable value of Mr. William's land as W. The effective tax rate for each type of land after subsidies is calculated as follows: For arable land: Effective tax rate = (Tax rate - Subsidy per hectare / Value per hectare) * 100% Since we don't have the value per hectare, we can't calculate the effective tax rate directly. However, we can use the tax rate and subsidy to calculate the net tax paid per hectare. Net tax per hectare for arable land = (Tax rate * Value per hectare) - Subsidy = (1% * Value per hectare) - 100 For orchard land: Net tax per hectare for orchard land = (Tax rate * Value per hectare) - Subsidy = (2% * Value per hectare) - 50 For pasture land: Net tax per hectare for pasture land = (Tax rate * Value per hectare) - Subsidy = (0.5% * Value per hectare) - 20 Since we don't have the individual values per hectare for each type of land, we cannot calculate the exact net tax per hectare. However, we can still calculate the percentage of Mr. William's land over the total taxable land of the village using the total tax collected and the tax he paid. The total tax collected from the village is 3840, and Mr. William paid 480 after subsidies. Therefore, the percentage of Mr. William's land over the total taxable land of the village is: Percentage of Mr. William's land = (Mr. William's tax paid / Total tax collected) * 100% = (480 / 3840) * 100% = 12.5% Therefore, Mr. William's land represents boxed{12.5%} of the total taxable land of the village."},{"prompt":"Two cards are chosen at random from a standard 52card deck.

This gives us: [ text{Radius} = frac{text{Diameter}}{2} = frac{10cm}{2} = 5cm ] The distance between the center of the circle and a line, denoted as d, helps us determine the relationship between the circle and the line. We analyze the scenarios based on the value of d: 1. **When d = 5cm:** The line is exactly at a distance equal to the radius of the circle from its center. This means the line touches the circle at exactly one point, making it tangent to the circle. 2. **When d < 5cm:** The line is closer to the center of the circle than its radius. In this case, the line intersects the circle, passing through it and having two points of intersection. 3. **When d > 5cm:** The line is further from the center of the circle than its radius. This means the line does not touch or intersect the circle at all, and it is considered to be externally tangent or not interacting with the circle. Given these scenarios, we can evaluate the options: - **Option A:** States the line intersects the circle when d=8cm. This is incorrect because when d > 5cm, the line does not intersect the circle. - **Option B:** Suggests the line is externally tangent to the circle when d=4.5cm.

Thus, we can rewrite the fraction as: [ frac{x^2 - y^2}{(x + y)^2} = frac{(x + y)(x - y)}{(x + y)^2} = frac{x - y}{x + y} ] Since we were able to reduce the fraction, it means that the original fraction was not in its simplest form.

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions n = 12 and n = -13. 4. Since n must be positive, we discard n = -13 and keep n = 12. Therefore, the number is boxed{12}. # Method 3: Quick Estimation (Countdown Round Approach) 1. Recognize that the sum of a number and its square is 156. The square of a number close to this must be just under 156. 2. Knowing the squares, 13^2 = 169 is too large, and 11^2 = 121 is too small. 3.

If a^2 = a and -1 = b, solving a^2 = a gives a^2 - a = 0, which implies a(a - 1) = 0. This means a = 0 or a = 1. Since a cannot be 0 (as a^2 and 0 are considered different elements in the set), we have a = 1. Consequently, b = -1. 2. If a^2 = b and -1 = a, then directly we have a = -1, and since b must match a^2, we get b = (-1)^2 = 1. Therefore, we have two cases: - Case 1: a = 1, b = -1. - Case 2: a = -1, b = 1.

A negative omega would imply a reflection and/or stretching that does not align with having more extreme points than zeros in the given interval. Thus, we conclude omega > 0. 2. **Change of Variable**: Let omega x+frac{pi}{3}=t. This transformation helps us analyze the function in terms of t which simplifies the process. The interval for x from (0,pi) translates to t being in the interval left(frac{pi}{3}, piomega +frac{pi}{3}right). 3. **Finding omega from Zeros**: For the function to have two zeros in the given interval, the transformed interval must cover at least one full period of the sine function but no more than one and a half periods.

Rewriting this equation: [ 85y + 640 = 1600k ] Simplify by dividing by 5: [ 17y + 128 = 320k ] 8. Solving for (y): [ 17y = 320k - 128 ] [ y = frac{320k - 128}{17} ] Since (y) must be an integer, (frac{320k - 128}{17}) must also be an integer. 9. To maintain integer values, (320k - 128) must be divisible by (17). 10. We examine possible values of (k) (which should be common denominations like 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 1000, 10000...). Only the value (k = 1000) ensures that (frac{320k - 128}{17}) is an integer. 11. Substitution (k = 1000): [ y = frac{320 cdot 1000 - 128}{17} = frac{320000 - 128}{17} = frac{319872}{17} = 18816 ] 12.

If there are k or more of such weights, put all these weights in the second box. - Next, from the remaining weights, take those that are divisible by k but **not** by k^2. Repeat the process: - If these new weights fit in the first box so that it still contains fewer than k weights, place them there. - If they don't fit in the first box, or if we've already moved to the second box, place all these weights in the second box. - Continue this process with weights divisible by higher powers of k, such as k^2, k^3, etc., until all weights are distributed between the two boxes. 4. **Ensuring a Weight in Second Box**: Since the total number of weights is at least k, some weights will inevitably be placed in the second box, ensuring that at least one complete even-mass group cannot be formed in the first box alone. This implies that the second box will contain weights, whose collective divisibility properties we will examine. 5. **Weights Grouped by Divisibility**: Consider the group of weights from the second box where all weights are divisible by k^r but **not** by k^{r+1}. Thus, any complete valid group (one of the k groups) needs to have their total mass divisible by k^r but not necessarily by higher powers. 6. **Total Mass Divisibility**: Since there are k equal groups, the total mass of the weights should be divisible by k^{r+1} if they were divided into k groups before removing a weight. 7. **Impact of Weight Removal**: Suppose we remove a weight whose mass is **not** divisible by k^{r+1}. The remaining weights should still be divisible by k^{r} but no longer by k^{r+1}. If the total mass of the remaining weights is divisible by k^{r+1}, then the removed weight must have contributed to the divisibility by k^{r+1}. 8. **Contradiction and Conclusion**: If fewer than k ways to remove a weight existed, we would be able to form the k equal-weight groups out of the remaining weights. However, given our divisibility conditions, this would contradict the properties ensured by initial divisibility constraints. Therefore, there must be at least k distinct ways to remove one weight, such that the remaining weights cannot be divided into k equal-mass groups. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{text{There are at least } k text{ ways to remove one weight so that the remaining weights cannot be divided into } k text{ equal-mass groups.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Observe the algebraic expressions and their corresponding values in the table below and answer the questions: | x | ldots | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | ldots | ||||||||| | 2x7 | ldots | 11 | 9 | 7 | a | 3 | ldots | | 3x+2 | ldots | 4 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 8 | ldots | | 2x+5 | ldots | 9 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 1 | ldots | | 3x1 | ldots | b | 2 | 1 | 4 | 7 | ldots | (1) [Initial Perception] According to the information in the table, a=______, b=______; when x=______, the value of 3x+2 is 7 greater than the value of 2x+5.

Its mutually exclusive event is not hitting at allâmissing both times, which, in fact, is also the complementary event. This question tests the understanding of mutually exclusive and complementary events. Complementary events refer to outcomes that cannot occur together within the same experiment. When encountered with the task of finding the probability of events described by \\"at least,\\" it is often easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event."},{"prompt":"Graph the set of all points on the coordinate plane ( x, y ) for which y^{2} y = x^{2} x.","completion":"1.

We need to find (a + b + c). 1. **Understanding the Geometry**: - Each circle has a radius of 1. - Each circle passes through the center of the other two circles. - The centers of the three circles form an equilateral triangle with side length equal to the radius of the circles, which is 1. 2. **Area of the Equilateral Triangle**: - The side length of the equilateral triangle formed by the centers of the circles is 1. - The area (A_{text{triangle}}) of an equilateral triangle with side length (s) is given by: [ A_{text{triangle}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 ] - Substituting (s = 1): [ A_{text{triangle}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} cdot 1^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] 3. **Area of the Three Circles**: - The area of one circle with radius 1 is: [ A_{text{circle}} = pi cdot 1^2 = pi ] - The total area of the three circles is: [ 3 pi ] 4. **Overlapping Areas**: - Each pair of circles overlaps in a lens-shaped region. - The area of each lens-shaped region can be found by subtracting the area of the equilateral triangle from the area of the sector of the circle. - The angle subtended by each sector is (60^circ) or (frac{pi}{3}) radians. - The area of one sector is: [ A_{text{sector}} = frac{1}{6} pi cdot 1^2 = frac{pi}{6} ] - The area of one lens-shaped region is: [ A_{text{lens}} = 2 left( frac{pi}{6} - frac{sqrt{3}}{4} right) = frac{pi}{3} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] - There are three such lens-shaped regions, so the total area of the overlapping regions is: [ 3 left( frac{pi}{3} - frac{sqrt{3}}{2} right) = pi - frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} ] 5. **Total Area of the Venn Diagram**: - The total area of the Venn Diagram is the area of the three circles minus the area of the overlapping regions plus the area of the equilateral triangle: [ A_{text{total}} = 3 pi - left( pi - frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} right) + frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] [ A_{text{total}} = 3 pi - pi + frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] [ A_{text{total}} = 2 pi + frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] [ A_{text{total}} = 2 pi + frac{6sqrt{3}}{4} + frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] [ A_{text{total}} = 2 pi + frac{7sqrt{3}}{4} ] 6. **Identifying (a), (b), and (c)**: - Comparing with the form (frac{a}{b}pi + sqrt{c}), we have: [ frac{a}{b} = 2 quad text{and} quad sqrt{c} = frac{7sqrt{3}}{4} ] - Therefore, (a = 2), (b = 1), and (c = 21). 7. **Sum of (a), (b), and (c)**: - The sum is: [ a + b + c = 2 + 1 + 21 = 24 ] The final answer is (boxed{24})."},{"prompt":"ld, Tanya, and Ulysses paint a very long picket fence.

Find the sum of all the paintable integers.","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the conditions under which every picket is painted exactly once by Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses, given their unique painting patterns. Let's break down the solution step by step, adhering closely to the provided solution but expanding on the reasoning and calculations. 1. **Initial Observation**: - It's clear that none of h, t, u can be 1. If any of them were 1, that painter would paint every picket, leaving no picket for the others to paint without overpainting. 2. **Case Analysis Based on h**: - **Case h=2**: This is not feasible because then Harold would paint the first and every second picket thereafter, including the third picket. However, Ulysses starts with the third picket, leading to overpainting. - **Case h=3**: For this to work without overpainting, both t and u must also be divisible by 3 to avoid painting the pickets Harold paints. Additionally, to ensure the fourth and fifth pickets are painted (by Tanya and Ulysses respectively), t and u must both be 3. Hence, 333 is a paintable number. - **Case h=4**: Here, t must be even to avoid painting Harold's pickets, and similarly, u must be even but cannot be 2 mod 4 to avoid conflict with Harold and Tanya's pattern. Therefore, u must be 0 mod 4, and t must be 2 mod 4. To ensure the fifth and sixth pickets are painted, t=2 and u=4. Thus, 424 is paintable. - **Case h>5**: If h were greater than 5, then the resulting paintable number would exceed 999, which is not possible within the constraints of the problem (considering the format 100h+10t+u). 3. **Conclusion**: - The only paintable numbers under these conditions are 333 and 424. - Summing these gives us the total sum of all paintable numbers: 333 + 424 = 757. Therefore, the sum of all paintable integers is boxed{757}."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = ln dfrac {1+x}{1x}, its domain is set A, and set B=(a, a+1), where B subseteq A.

However, evaluating f(x) at x = dfrac 1 2 gives fleft( dfrac 1 2 right) = ln 3, and fleft(-dfrac 1 2 right) = ln dfrac 1 3.

This in itself does not ensure that a parrot has been pecked by exactly 5 other parrots. Let's show that there is at least one parrot pecked at most 5 times. - If every parrot in the aviary were pecked at least 6 times, then the total number of instances of a parrot being pecked would be at least 100 times 6 = 600. - However, since each parrot pecked exactly 5 other parrots, the total number of times parrots pecked others is 100 times 5 = 500. - This creates a contradiction: [ 600 text{ peckings (minimum) >} 500 text{ peckings (maximum)}. ] - Therefore, there must be at least one parrot that was pecked at most 5 times.

Let a denote the side length, b denote the length of the shorter diagonal, c denote the length of the longer diagonal, and r denote the radius of the circumscribed circle of a regular nonagon. 2. We know that the central angle corresponding to one side of a regular nonagon is 40^circ. Hence, the central angle corresponding to b is 80^circ, and the one corresponding to c is 160^circ. 3. Using the properties of circumscribed circles, we have: [ a = 2r sin 20^circ, quad b = 2r sin 40^circ, quad c = 2r sin 80^circ ] 4.

This completes the proof since ( sin 40^circ + sin 20^circ = sin 80^circ). Hence, (a + b = c). **Second Solution:** 1. Consider the lines ( AB ) and ( ED ) which intersect at a point ( P ). 2. Note the angles ( angle BAE ) and ( angle DEA ) are hence both ( frac{1}{2} times 3 times 40^circ = 60^circ ). 3. Because ( triangle PAE ) is isosceles and symmetric with respect to the axis of symmetry of the nonagon, it is also equilateral. 4. Since lines ( BD parallel AE ), the triangle ( triangle BPD ) is equilateral, confirming ( BP = BD = AC ). - This follows because ( AC ) and ( BD ) are both diagonals of a regular nonagon that connect every second vertex.

To prove this, we utilize the rearrangement inequality which states that for non-negative (x, y, z): [ sum x^3 geq sum x^2 y ] and [ sum x^3 geq sum y^2 x. ] This is evident since (sum x^3) is already larger as each (x^3) term has a higher degree of magnitude compared to the respective mixed terms. 4.

Profit = 30% of CP Profit = 0.30 * 75.00 Profit = 22.50 So, the desired SP to achieve a 30% profit would be: SP = CP + Profit SP = 75.00 + 22.50 SP = 97.50 Now, let's calculate the SP after the first discount of 12%, which we'll call SP1. SP1 = SP - (12% of SP) SP1 = 97.50 - (0.12 * 97.50) SP1 = 97.50 - 11.70 SP1 = 85.80 Next, we need to account for the 10% commission on SP1. Let's call the commission C. C = 10% of SP1 C = 0.10 * 85.80 C = 8.58 The seller needs to make SP1 plus the commission C to achieve the desired profit. So, the price before the commission, which we'll call PBC, would be: PBC = SP1 + C PBC = 85.80 + 8.58 PBC = 94.38 Now, we need to find the list price (LP) before the first discount of 12% and the additional 5% discount. We know that PBC is the price after the first discount of 12%, so we can calculate LP as follows: PBC = LP - (12% of LP) 94.38 = LP - (0.12 * LP) 94.38 = LP - 0.12LP 94.38 = 0.88LP LP = 94.38 / 0.88 LP = 107.25 Finally, we need to find the marked price (MP) before the additional 5% discount. We know that PBC is the price after the additional 5% discount, so we can calculate MP as follows: PBC = MP - (5% of MP) 94.38 = MP - (0.05 * MP) 94.38 = MP - 0.05MP 94.38 = 0.95MP MP = 94.38 / 0.95 MP = 99.35 Therefore, the book must be marked at boxed{99.35} in order to achieve the desired profit and commission after the discounts."},{"prompt":"What is the remainder when 11^{2010} is divided by 50?","completion":"First, we calculate the first few powers of 11 modulo 50: - 11^0 equiv 1 mod 50. - 11^1 equiv 11 mod 50. - 11^2 = 121 equiv 21 mod 50. - 11^3 = 1331 equiv 31 mod 50 (since 1331 - 50*26 = 31). - 11^4 = 14641 equiv 41 mod 50 (since 14641 - 50*292 = 41). - 11^5 = 161051 equiv 1 mod 50 (since 161051 - 50*3221 = 1).

Since most of the numbers are fractions, we'll convert the decimal numbers to fractions as well. 1.7 can be written as 17/10 (since 1.7 is the same as 17 tenths). 1.4 can be written as 14/10 (since 1.4 is the same as 14 tenths).

Midlines in a quadrilateral form specific shapes under certain conditions, which will be pivotal for our proof. Statement 1: If the midlines of a quadrilateral are equal, then its diagonals are perpendicular, and conversely. 1. Let ( ABCD ) be a quadrilateral with midlines ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ). Suppose ( M_1 = M_2 ). 2. Since the midlines are equal, it implies that when joined, the midpoints form a parallelogram ( PQRS ), and given ( M_1 = M_2 ), this parallelogram ( PQRS ) is actually a rectangle due to the equality of opposite sides and right angles. 3. By the properties of midlines, each midline of the quadrilateral is parallel to one pair of opposite sides and half their length. Thus, the vertices of the quadrilateral ( ABCD ) are connected such that ( (A, C) ) and ( (B, D) ) are diagonals crossing at the center of the rectangle. 4. Rectangles have perpendicular diagonals. Therefore, the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) of ( ABCD ) are perpendicular. **Converse:** 1. Suppose the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) of quadrilateral ( ABCD ) are perpendicular. 2. The midlines ( M ) connecting the midpoints of ( AB ) and ( CD ), and ( N ) connecting the midpoints of ( AD ) and ( BC ) will be equal because those lines form right triangles within the overarching rectangle formed by the diagonals (AC) and (BD). 3. Consequently, if the diagonals are perpendicular, the midlines are equal. Thus, the first statement is proved. Statement 2: If the midlines of a quadrilateral are perpendicular, then its diagonals are equal, and conversely. 1. Suppose ( ABCD ) is a quadrilateral with perpendicular midlines ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ). 2. The perpendicularity of the midlines ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) implies that when they intersect, they form a rhombus ( PQRS ). 3. By properties of midlines, the midpoints of the sides of the quadrilateral form a rhombus, meaning the diagonals of quadrilateral ( ABCD ) split each other into equal lengths. 4. Since a rhombus' diagonals bisect each other at right angles and the midlines of our quadrilateral are perpendicular, it follows that diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) must be equal for the midlines to preserve perpendicularity. **Converse:** 1. Suppose the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) of quadrilateral ( ABCD ) are equal. 2. The midlines ( M ) and ( N ) will be perpendicular because the intersection of the diagonals at equal lengths ensures the formation of right-angled sides within the rhombus ( PQRS ). 3. Therefore, equal diagonals result in perpendicular midlines, confirming our implication.

Let us consider the function varphi(x) = mg(x) + xf(x) = mx^2 + xln x.

Now, we need to check if (ab + bc + ca = -1007) is possible with rational numbers (a, b, c) such that (a + b + c = 0). 12. Since (a, b, c) are rational numbers, the sum of their products (ab + bc + ca) must also be rational. 13.

Thus, ((frac{b^2 + k}{a}, b)) is a solution, and therefore ((b, frac{b^2 + k}{a})) is a solution. Since ( b < a ), we must have (frac{b^2 + k}{a} geq b), otherwise ( b + frac{b^2 + k}{a} < a + b ), contradicting the minimality of ( a + b ).

However, points on the boundary have fewer neighbors. - Each interior point has 4 neighbors. - Each edge point (excluding corners) has 3 neighbors. - Each corner point has 2 neighbors. Let's count the pairs in the 45 times 45 grid: - There are 45 times 44 horizontal pairs. - There are 45 times 44 vertical pairs. So, the total number of pairs in the 45 times 45 grid is: [ 45 times 44 + 45 times 44 = 2 times 45 times 44 = 3960 ] Removing the points (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) affects the count of pairs: - Removing (1,1) removes 2 pairs: (1,1)-(1,2) and (1,1)-(2,1). - Removing (1,2) removes 2 pairs: (1,2)-(1,3) and (1,2)-(2,2). - Removing (1,3) removes 2 pairs: (1,3)-(1,4) and (1,3)-(2,3).

Since lvert S_L rvert = lvert S_R rvert and lvert S_T rvert = lvert S_B rvert, the maximum number of pairs is: [ 4044 - (lvert S_L rvert + lvert S_T rvert) ] We need to show that a + b = lvert S_L rvert + lvert S_T rvert geq 90.

If the referee gets within 1 meter of the whistle, he will see it. What should the referee do? Estimate the number of steps it will take for the referee to find the whistle if he was initially d meters away from it.","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Strategy**: The referee starts at corner A of the football field, which is a 100 times 70 meter rectangle. The referee can only take steps of 1 meter in any arbitrary direction and gets feedback after every step about whether they are closer or further from the whistle. 2. **Movement Path**: - The referee starts moving directly from A to the opposite corner C. As they proceed, if at any point it is indicated that they are moving away from the whistle, they stop and mark the current position as Q and the last position as P. - The referee then returns from Q to P and takes a step perpendicular to the AC line. 3. **Orthogonal Directions**: - After stepping perpendicular, if getting closer to the whistle, they continue along this new line until they see the whistle. - If they are not closer, they go the opposite direction on the perpendicular line of AC until they see the whistle. 4. **Algorithm Analysis**: - If the whistle is found while moving along AC, they will have taken at most âd + 1â steps, where d is the distance from the starting point. - If the initial perpendicular movement suggests the referee was further, the process involves calculating the possible regions where the whistle might be, narrowing the search area by checking perpendicular directions from those points. 5. **Region of Interest**: - Suppose P and Q are close, the regions formed by the perpendicular bisectors give the possible bands where the whistle lies. Refining this, the whistle lies within a 1 meter band along the central search path. 6. **Bounding Step Count**: - Analyzing the steps where the referee does orthogonal checks and returns, the number of steps to find the whistle can be bound.

Furthermore, since there is an extreme value at x = 1, we must have f'(1) = 0. Plugging x = 1 into the derivative gives f'(1) = 3*1^2 + 2a*1 + b = 3 + 2a + b = 0. This gives us another equation 3 + 2a + b = 0; let's call this Equation â¡. Solving Equations â  and â¡ simultaneously, we get a = 2 and b = -4.

Let ( F ) be a point on the extension of ( BC ) beyond ( C ) such that ( BF = 5BA ). Let ( k ) be the circle with diameter ( BF ). Let one of the intersection points of the circle centered at ( F ) with radius ( BC ) and ( k ) be ( G ). Draw the line ( BG ). Let the midpoint of ( CE ) be ( H ), and let ( J ) be the point on segment ( BC ) such that ( BK = BJ ). The segment ( KG ) is approximately equal to the length of the semicircle ( BDC ).

After 71,382 the next such palindrome would be 71,417 (this is since the sequence of palindromes will next reflect the initial '71' as '71,417').

From point 2, we can deduce that Jolyn is 2 + 5 = 7 months older than Aivo because Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese, who is 5 months older than Aivo. From point 3, since Leon is 2 months older than Aivo, and we know Jolyn is 7 months older than Aivo, we can calculate the age difference between Jolyn and Leon as follows: Jolyn's age relative to Aivo = Aivo's age + 7 months Leon's age relative to Aivo = Aivo's age + 2 months To find out how much older Jolyn is than Leon, we subtract Leon's relative age from Jolyn's relative age: Jolyn's relative age - Leon's relative age = (Aivo's age + 7 months) - (Aivo's age + 2 months) = Aivo's age + 7 months - Aivo's age - 2 months = 7 months - 2 months = 5 months Therefore, Jolyn is boxed{5} months older than Leon."},{"prompt":"The digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 can be arranged to form many different 6digit positive integers with six distinct digits.

We calculate frac{99}{17} = 5 + frac{14}{17}, indicating that this rule (addition by 1) was applied five times, so m-1 is divisible by 32. 3. We find s_{frac{m-1}{32}} = frac{14}{17}.

This will divide each equilateral triangle face into 3 congruent smaller triangles. These smaller triangles are isosceles triangles. 4. **Step 4: Projection onto the Sphere** Now, project these isosceles triangles from the center of the sphere onto the surface of the sphere. This projection results in 60 congruent spherical triangles on the surface of the sphere. 5. **Step 5: Properties of the Spherical Triangles** Each of these 60 spherical triangles will have vertices that are the projection of the centroids and the vertices of the equilateral triangles of the icosahedron.

Since the worker gets 60 cents per hour for ordinary time, and she worked 50 hours in total with 8 hours of overtime, she worked 50 - 8 = 42 hours of ordinary time. The total amount for ordinary hours is 42 hours * 0.60/hour = 25.20. Now, we know that the total amount she earns for the week is 32.40. This includes both her ordinary time and overtime pay. We have already calculated her ordinary time pay, so we can find her overtime pay by subtracting the ordinary time pay from the total weekly pay: Total overtime pay = Total weekly pay - Ordinary time pay Total overtime pay = 32.40 - 25.20 Total overtime pay = 7.20 Since she worked 8 hours of overtime, we can now calculate her hourly overtime rate: Hourly overtime rate = Total overtime pay / Overtime hours Hourly overtime rate = 7.20 / 8 hours Hourly overtime rate = 0.90 per hour Therefore, the worker gets boxed{0.90} for an hour of overtime."},{"prompt":"Rationalize the denominator: frac{1}{sqrt{3}+1}.","completion":"To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is (sqrt{3}-1): [ frac{1}{sqrt{3}+1} cdot frac{sqrt{3}-1}{sqrt{3}-1} = frac{sqrt{3}-1}{(sqrt{3}+1)(sqrt{3}-1)} = frac{sqrt{3}-1}{3 - 1} = frac{sqrt{3}-1}{2} ] So, the rationalized form of the expression is: [ boxed{frac{sqrt{3}-1}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Michael, Emma, and their cousin, Lucas, want to dig a team hole together.

The deepest of the three desired depths is Michael's at 4300 feet. Now, let's calculate the combined digging rate of Michael, Emma, and Lucas.

Let's start with Batch A: Batch A has 70% water, so it has 30% solid content. The weight of the solid content in Batch A is 30% of 100 kg = 0.30 * 100 kg = 30 kg. When dried, Batch A will have 20% water content, which means it will have 80% solid content. Since the solid content doesn't change, the dried weight of Batch A will be: Let the dried weight of Batch A be ( x ) kg, then ( 0.80 * x = 30 kg ) ( x = 30 kg / 0.80 ) ( x = 37.5 kg ) Now, let's calculate for Batch B: Batch B has 75% water, so it has 25% solid content. The weight of the solid content in Batch B is 25% of 150 kg = 0.25 * 150 kg = 37.5 kg. When dried, Batch B will have 25% water content, which means it will have 75% solid content.

Analyze the terms ( b+c-a, a+c-b, b+a-c ). Note that in the context of a triangle inequality, the conditions ( a + b > c ), ( a + c > b ), ( b + c > a ) ensure that among ( b+c-a, a+c-b, b+a-c ), no more than one of these can be negative. For example, if ( a + b - c < 0 ) and ( b + c - a < 0 ), then ( 2b < 0 ), which is impossible since ( b ) is non-negative. 4. Suppose that exactly one of the terms ( b+c-a, a+c-b, b+a-c ) is negative. Then the product of these terms will be non-positive.

First, find the focus of the parabola to determine the focus of the ellipse on the x-axis, then verify the options to obtain the answer. 1. Find the focus of the parabola y^{2} = 8x. The focus of a parabola in the form y^{2} = 4px is given by (p, 0). In this case, p = 2, so the focus is (2, 0). 2. Since the right focus of the ellipse is the same as the focus of the parabola, the focus of the ellipse is (c, 0), where c = 2. In an ellipse with equation frac{x^{2}}{m^{2}} + frac{y^{2}}{n^{2}} = 1, the focus is (c, 0), where c = sqrt{m^{2} - n^{2}}. Given that the eccentricity e = frac{c}{m} = frac{1}{2}, we can find m and n by solving these equations. 3. We can eliminate options A and C because the focus of the ellipse should be on the x-axis, which requires m > n. 4. Now, let's verify the remaining options B and D: - For option B: frac{x^{2}}{16} + frac{y^{2}}{12} = 1, we have m = 4 and n = sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3}.

Calculating: - For (a = 18), we have (b+c+d = 18), and there are (binom{17}{2} = 136) ways. - For (a = 19), (b+c+d = 17), and there are (binom{16}{2} = 120) ways. - Continue this pattern down to (a = 34), (b+c+d = 2), and there are (binom{1}{2} = 0) ways. Summing these invalid cases: [ 4 times (136 + 120 + ldots + 0) = 4 times binom{18}{3} = 816 ] Thus, valid partitions: [ binom{35}{3} - 816 = 6545 - 816 = 5729 ] Account for symmetry: - 1 square case, (a = b = c = d = 9) - 14 rectangle cases (where sides are paired but not all four sides are equal) Adjust for rotations: - Subtract the square and double the rectangle cases, then divide the rest by 4: [ 1 + 14 + frac{5729 - 1 - 2 times 14}{4} = 15 + frac{5700}{4} = 15 + 1425 = 1440 ] Therefore, the total number of different quadrilaterals is: [ boxed{1440} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a parallelogram (ABCD).

Since he is paid 30 per hour for a 48-hour workweek, his weekly income is: 30/hour * 48 hours/week = 1440/week Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, his monthly income is: 1440/week * 4 weeks/month = 5760/month Now, let's calculate his total monthly expenses, including the 500 on food and 1000 on taxes: 500 (food) + 1000 (taxes) = 1500 After paying his monthly expenses, he has 2340 left. This means the total amount spent on expenses including rent is: 5760 (monthly income) - 2340 (remaining) = 3420 (spent on expenses) Since we already know he spends 1500 on food and taxes, we can calculate the amount spent on rent by subtracting this from the total expenses: 3420 (total expenses) - 1500 (food and taxes) = 1920 (spent on rent) Now, to find the fraction of his income that he spends on rent, we divide the amount spent on rent by his total monthly income: 1920 (rent) / 5760 (monthly income) = 1/3 Therefore, the firefighter spends boxed{1/3} of his income on rent."},{"prompt":"Find the domain of the function ( f(x) = sqrt[3]{2x 4} + sqrt{10 x} ).","completion":"1.

This means each cup number ( n ) is equivalent to some ( x ) modulo 30. We now determine the number of empty cups. We use the Euler's totient function, ( varphi(30) ), to find how many integers between 1 and 30 are coprime to 30.

There are two types of buses, type A and type B, with their passenger capacities and rental fees shown in the table below: | | Type A Bus | Type B Bus | |||| | Passenger Capacity (people/bus) | 45 | 60 | | Rental Fee (å/bus) | 200 | 300 | (1) How many teachers and students participated in this study tour?

From the problem statement, we have two conditions: 1. If 45-seat buses are used, 15 more people than the total capacity of the buses are participating, leading to the equation: 45y + 15 = x. 2. If 60-seat buses are used, with three extra buses needed and the remaining buses fully occupied, we get the equation: 60(y - 3) = x. Solving this system of equations: [ begin{align*} 45y + 15 &= x 60(y - 3) &= x end{align*} ] Setting the two expressions for x equal to each other gives: [ begin{align*} 45y + 15 &= 60(y - 3) 45y + 15 &= 60y - 180 195 &= 15y y &= 13 end{align*} ] Substituting y = 13 into one of the original equations to find x: [ begin{align*} 45(13) + 15 &= x 585 + 15 &= x x &= 600 end{align*} ] Therefore, the number of teachers and students participating in the study tour is boxed{600} people, and the original plan was to rent boxed{13} 45-seat buses.

Comparing the total rental fees, 2800 yuan for 45-seat buses is less than 3000 yuan for 60-seat buses. Therefore, renting 14 45-seat buses is more cost-effective, resulting in a total cost of boxed{2800} yuan."},{"prompt":"huey ' s hip pizza sells two sizes of square pizzas : a small pizza that measures 6 inches on a side and costs 10 , and a large pizza that measures 9 inches on a side and costs 20 . if two friends go to huey ' s with 30 apiece , how many more square inches of pizza can they buy if they pool their money than if they each purchase pizza alone ?","completion":"First, let's calculate the area of each size of pizza to determine how many square inches of pizza they get for each option. The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. For the small pizza: Area = side^2 = 6 inches * 6 inches = 36 square inches For the large pizza: Area = side^2 = 9 inches * 9 inches = 81 square inches Now let's calculate how many pizzas they can buy alone and then pooling their money. If they each purchase pizza alone with 30: - They can buy 3 small pizzas each (10 each), which would be 3 * 36 square inches = 108 square inches per person, or 216 square inches total for both. - They can buy 1 large pizza each (20 each), which would be 1 * 81 square inches = 81 square inches per person, or 162 square inches total for both. If they pool their money (60 total): - They can buy 6 small pizzas (10 each), which would be 6 * 36 square inches = 216 square inches total. - They can buy 3 large pizzas (20 each), which would be 3 * 81 square inches = 243 square inches total. Comparing the pooled money option to the individual purchase option, we see that pooling their money to buy large pizzas gives them the most pizza area. So, the difference in square inches of pizza they can buy if they pool their money versus if they each purchase pizza alone is: 243 square inches (pooled, large pizzas) - 216 square inches (individual, small pizzas) = 27 square inches more with pooled money for large pizzas.

Therefore, the total number of games played in the tournament can be calculated by the combination formula binom{n}{2} where n is the number of participants: [ binom{8}{2} = frac{8 times 7}{2 times 1} = 28 ] 2. Each game yields 1 point in total (either 1 point for a win and 0 points for a loss, or 0.5 points for each player in a draw). Therefore, the total number of points scored by all players combined is equal to the total number of games: [ text{Total points} = 28 ] 3. The condition states that all participants scored a different number of points. Thus, to determine a valid distribution of points meeting the conditions (i.e., all scores being different and summing to 28), consider the sequence: [ 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 ] Here, each score is unique, summing to: [ 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 28 ] This sequence satisfies the requirement that each score is a distinct whole number from 0 to 7. 4.

Thus, for frac{1}{2^x+2}, its range is (0,frac{1}{2}). Consequently, 1-frac{1}{2^x+2}inleft(frac{1}{2},1right). Therefore, the range of the function when a=b=2 is boxed{left(frac{1}{2},1right)}. **(2) Existence of a positive number b for the function to be even when a=0:** With a=0, the function transforms into y=frac{b^x+1}{2^x}. Assuming there exists a b making the function even, we need to satisfy frac{b^x+1}{2^x}=frac{b^{-x}+1}{2^{-x}}. Upon simplification, this leads to frac{b^{-x}+1}{2^{-x}}=frac{1+b^x}{2^x}=frac{(1+b^x)cdot 2^x}{b^x}. This implies b^x=4^x, and therefore b=4. For b=4, the function becomes y=frac{4^x+1}{2^x}=2^x+frac{1}{2^x}, which is indeed an even function. Hence, there exists a positive number boxed{b=4} such that the function is even. **(3) Range of a for the function to be strictly increasing on left[-1,+inftyright) when a>0 and b=4:** Consider y=frac{4^x+1}{2^x+a} and let x_1, x_2 in left[-1,+inftyright) with x_1 < x_2. The difference between y_1 and y_2 is y_1-y_2=frac{(2^{x_1}-2^{x_2})[2^{x_1+x_2}-1+a(2^{x_1}+2^{x_2})]}{(2^{x_1}+a)(2^{x_2}+a)}. For the function to be strictly increasing, y_1-y_2 < 0 must hold. Given that a > 0, we ensure (2^{x_1}+a)(2^{x_2}+a) > 0 and 2^{x_1}-2^{x_2} < 0. This requires 2^{x_1+x_2}-1+a(2^{x_1}+2^{x_2}) > 0, leading to a > frac{-2^{x_1+x_2}+1}{2^{x_1}+2^{x_2}}. To find the maximum of frac{-2^{x_1+x_2}+1}{2^{x_1}+2^{x_2}}, we consider the case when -2^{x_1+x_2}+1 > 0. Applying AM-GM inequality, frac{-2^{x_1+x_2}+1}{2^{x_1}+2^{x_2}} leq frac{1}{2}left(-sqrt{2^{x_1+x_2}}+frac{1}{sqrt{2^{x_1+x_2}}}right). Since y=-sqrt{2^x}+frac{1}{sqrt{2^x}} is decreasing, the maximum occurs when x_1=x_2=-1. Thus, frac{1}{2}left(-sqrt{2^{-2}}+frac{1}{sqrt{2^{-2}}}right)=frac{3}{4}.

The player who cannot make a move loses. Prove that with optimal play, the second player will win. (S. Berlov)","completion":"1. **Initial Understanding:** We are given a problem where a sports hall in the shape of a square with a side length of 100 meters is covered with square tiles of size 1 text{ meter} times 1 text{ meter}. Two players take turns covering the floor with mats, where each mat covers two adjacent tiles. The first player places one mat per move, while the second player places three mats per move. A tile cannot be covered by more than five mats at any given point. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. 2. **Strategy for the Second Player:** The key to solving this problem is to devise a strategy for the second player that ensures they can always make a move. Let's consider that the second player (Player 2) mentally divides the hall into 2 times 2 blocks. Let's call those blocks \\"units.\\" Given the initial setup: - The sports hall has dimensions 100 times 100, leading us to 50 times 50 blocks (each block being 2 times 2), giving a total of 2500 blocks. 3. **Second Player's Move:** Each time Player 1 makes a move, Player 2 must respond in a way that retains balance. Specifically, Player 2 will ensure covering cells in such a way that after their turn, the number of mats used in each block remains balanced (i.e., all cells in each block remain covered the same number of times). 4. **Inductive Step:** We now show that Player 2 will always have the opportunity to place mats: - **Case 1:** If Player 1 places their mat across two blocks, Player 2 will place mats such that the remaining cells of those two blocks are fully covered and all cells in each block are covered equivalently. - **Case 2:** If Player 1 places their mat within a single block, Player 2 places one mat within the same block, ensuring that all four cells within the block are covered uniformly. The remaining two mats are placed on any two other cells in blocks that still have less than five coverage. 5. **Finding Covered Blocks:** To prove the existence of a block covered in less than five layers: - Assume there is no block covered in less than five layers. This means all 2500 blocks are covered by exactly five mats. The total number of mats placed is 5 times 2500 = 12500 mats. - Notice that if a block has cells covered exactly five times, after the first player's turn (an act covering two cells), the remaining coverage is divided among the other player's subsequent moves in multiple layers. 6. **Contradiction:** Given that each turn involves the placement of 4 new mat pairs per round (4 pairs per one initial mat): - Hence, the total number of mats follows: [ text{Mats used} = 12504 = 4k text{ for every complete cycle} + 2 ] - Given pairs come in multiples of 4 but total number mismatches leads to contradiction for exact 2 surplus. All blocks must have a 'less than' mark requirement. 7. **Conclusion:** Player 2 can always place the mats without violating the constraints of the problem: One block covered equivalently multiple times while maintaining balance. Thus, under proper strategy, Player 2 will always be able to make a move and will eventually win the game when Player 1 is unable to cover new blocks accurately: [ boxed{text{Player 2 Wins}} ]"},{"prompt":"the expression e cdot c^a + b d, the values of a, b, c, d, and e are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, although not necessarily in that order.

This would mean forming a triangle using three edges connected to a same vertex. 3. **Necessary Conditions:** - For vertex A, the edges are DA, AC, and AB. - For vertex B, the edges are DB, BC, and AB. - To form a valid triangle at a vertex, the side lengths must satisfy the triangle inequality, i.e., the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. 4. **Applying the Triangle Inequalities:** - Assume Vasya cannot form a triangle with the edges emanating from vertex A and vertex B. - This means: [ AB geq AC + AD quad text{(no triangle can be formed at A)} ] [ AB geq BC + BD quad text{(no triangle can be formed at B)} ] 5. **Summation of Inequalities:** - Adding the two inequalities above: [ 2AB geq AC + AD + BC + BD ] 6. **Checking for Logical Consistency:** - However, from the triangle inequalities for the faces ABD and ABC: [ AB < AD + BD ] [ AB < AC + BC ] - Adding these inequalities yields: [ 2AB < AD + BD + AC + BC ] - This creates a contradiction.

The remaining n-1 women have to follow the same rule, which can be done in R_{n-1} ways. - She can sit in seat (n-1). Then, woman n-1 must sit either in the seat n or seat n-2, reducing the problem to R_{n-2}. This leads to the same recursive formula because the circular arrangement mimics the line one: [ R_n = R_{n-1} + R_{n-2} ] Step 3: Compute R_{15} using the recursive formula Building on the same Fibonacci sequence as the original problem but using the customized base cases and calculating up to n = 15: - Following the calculated Fibonacci numbers up to S_{10} = 89: - R_3 = R_2 + R_1 = 2 + 1 = 3 - R_{15} can be extrapolated similarly as a Fibonacci number: 987. Conclusion The total number of ways fifteen women can be reseated according to the given rules in a circular arrangement is R_{15} = 987. Hence, the answer is 987.

Faces that share a vertex at (0,0,0) utilize the blue and either the red or black edges.

The difference q - r is a multiple of 99, so we want to maximize a - c while keeping the difference less than 300. The maximum value for a (the hundreds digit of q) is 9, and the minimum value for c (the units digit of r) is 1 (since q and r are three-digit numbers). Therefore, the maximum difference for a - c is 9 - 1 = 8. So the greatest possible value of q - r is 99 * 8 = 792. However, this exceeds the limit of being less than 300.

However, based on our scenario, it simplifies further. 5. **Maximum Chip Placement Consideration:** - If we consider lines, the board has 8 horizontal and 8 vertical lines. - Assign each chip a unique horizontal and vertical from the set of available lines. - If fewer than 8 lines are chosen, the combined intersections cannot exceed 14 due to constraints. 6. **Proof by Example:** - Consider an arrangement with leftmost and lowest lines almost filled except one cell like this: - Occupy 7 cells in the bottom row. - Occupy 7 cells in the first column (excluding the already occupied intersection). - Verify: - This sums to ( 7 + 7 = 14 ) unique positions.

The foci of the ellipse are located at (pm c, 0), where c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}. 2. **Identifying the Rectangle's Vertices**: Since the rectangle ABCD has its vertices on the ellipse and sides AD and BC pass through the foci, we can deduce that the length of AD and BC are along the major and minor axes, respectively. 3. **Determining the Length of Sides**: When x = c, the y-coordinate of points on the ellipse can be found by substituting x = c into the ellipse equation, yielding y = pmfrac{b^2}{a}. This indicates that the length of side BC (minor axis) is 2 times frac{b^2}{a} = frac{2b^2}{a}.

Let's calculate the probabilities: The total number of ways to draw two balls from m+n balls is binom{m+n}{2}. The number of ways to draw two red balls is binom{m}{2}.

Canceling binom{m+n}{2} from both sides and simplifying results in frac{m(m-1)}{2} = k cdot mn Rightarrow m(m-1) = 2kmn.

After a 50% decrease, his salary becomes 50% of S, which is 0.5S. He then lost 35% of his original salary, which means he is left with 65% of his original salary (100% - 35% = 65%). So, 65% of his original salary S is equal to the salary he has after the increase. We can express this as: 0.65S = final salary after increase We know that the final salary after increase is from a percentage increase on the decreased salary (0.5S). Let's call the percentage increase P%. The increased salary would be the decreased salary plus the increase, which we can express as: Increased salary = Decreased salary + (P% of Decreased salary) Increased salary = 0.5S + (P/100 * 0.5S) We know that the increased salary is equal to 0.65S, so we can set the two expressions equal to each other: 0.65S = 0.5S + (P/100 * 0.5S) Now, we can solve for P: 0.65S = 0.5S + (0.5P/100 * S) 0.65S = 0.5S + (0.005P * S) Subtract 0.5S from both sides: 0.65S - 0.5S = 0.005P * S 0.15S = 0.005P * S Divide both sides by S: 0.15 = 0.005P Now, divide both sides by 0.005 to solve for P: P = 0.15 / 0.005 P = 30 So, the percentage increase in Kamal's salary after the decrease was boxed{30%} ."},{"prompt":"A triangle has a side of length 10 cm, a side of length 24 cm, and a right angle.

The monkey starts at point B. The zoo paths consist of three longer paths forming an equilateral triangle, and three shorter paths connecting the midpoints of these longer paths. Each of these shorter paths is half the length of the longer paths. 2. **Movement Strategy**: - Initially, let Petya move to vertex B and Vasya move to vertex C. - Since the monkey runs three times faster than the guards, by the time Petya and Vasya reach B and C respectively, the monkey couldnât have traversed the longer distances AB or AC. 3. **Monkeyâs Possible Locations**: - If the monkey is on path BC, the chase straightforwardly implies the monkey is caught since itâs flanked from both sides while being slower along any direct path. - We can assume without loss of generality that the monkey is not on BC. 4. **Monitoring the Paths**: - Letâs now assume the monkey is in the right half of the zooâs paths, i.e., next to sides CE or CF. - Define control by Vasya over vertex C. Vasya monitors vertex C if his distance to C is no greater than frac{1}{3} of the monkey's distance to that vertex. 5. **Transition Movement**: - Petya stands at B, while Vasya starts moving towards B. - Let BC = 1 unit. In moving directly towards B, at some moment t, Vasya would cover frac{1}{3} of the monkey's distance from C. Given the monkeyâs speed, itâs apparent that the cumulative distances Vasya would have covered would always accumulate to maintaining a check at vertex C. 6. **Persistent Strategy**: - In time spans where Petya covers incl mediums, Vasya will always impose control over C while advancing. - Thus, as Vasya advances and almost reaches Petya, Petya would leap to vertex E, ensuring that at no moment does the monkey overrun both vertices C and B allowedly. 7. **Final Guard Movement**: - If the monkey switches towards left vicinity halfway through, both Petya and Vasya would gradually converge on point D, crafting a sieged path. - If the proximate region remains, Vasya retracts to C, and both guards converge on final reachable point from E or covering traversal to F as needed. 8. **Absorptive Conclusion**: - Thus the monkey would be hindered progressively across either cover paths via convergence and surrounding between guardsâ faster placement realities. **Conclusion**: Given this strategic and orchestrated movement, the guards would definitely catch the monkey.

Now, when he sells to the customer, he uses a weight such that when 50% is added to it, the claimed weight is obtained. Let's denote the actual weight he gives to the customer as x grams. According to the problem, x + 50% of x = the weight claimed by the trader. Let's find x: x + 0.5x = the weight claimed by the trader 1.5x = the weight claimed by the trader Since he claims to give 1000 grams (the original weight he should have received from the supplier), we have: 1.5x = 1000 x = 1000 / 1.5 x = 666.67 grams (approximately) So, the trader gives the customer approximately 666.67 grams but charges for 1000 grams.

What is the speed of sound in this scenario?","completion":"To find the speed of sound in this scenario, we need to calculate the distance the sound traveled in the time between the two blasts and then divide that distance by the time it took for the sound to reach the man. The man heard the second blast 30 minutes and 25 seconds after he started driving. Since the second blast occurred exactly 30 minutes after the first, the sound of the second blast took 25 seconds to reach him. The man was 8250 meters away from the site when he heard the second blast. This means that the sound traveled 8250 meters in 25 seconds. To find the speed of sound, we use the formula: Speed = Distance / Time First, we need to convert the time from seconds to hours to match the distance in meters: 25 seconds = 25/3600 hours (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour) Now we can calculate the speed of sound: Speed of sound = 8250 meters / (25/3600) hours Speed of sound = 8250 * (3600/25) meters/hour Speed of sound = 8250 * 144 meters/hour Speed of sound = 1188000 meters/hour To convert this speed into meters per second (since the speed of sound is usually given in meters per second), we divide by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour): Speed of sound = 1188000 / 3600 meters/second Speed of sound = 330 meters/second Therefore, the speed of sound in this scenario is boxed{330} meters per second."},{"prompt":"A merchant buys goods at 25% off the list price.

We will attempt to solve ( 1 = 2x - r ) for integers ( r ) and ( x ) that satisfy this equation and then check if ( m ) is less than 100. Through trial and error: - With ( r = 15 ), solving ( 1 = 2x - 15 ) gives ( x = 8 ). Then ( m = 15 times 8 + 3 = 123 ), which is too large. - With ( r = 14 ), solving ( 1 = 2x - 14 ) gives ( x = 7.5 ), which is not an integer. - With ( r = 13 ), solving ( 1 = 2x - 13 ) gives ( x = 7 ). Then ( m = 13 times 7 + 3 = 94 ), which satisfies ( m < 100 ). Check this value in the second formation: [ (13-1)(7+2) = 12 times 9 = 108 ], which does not match ( m ) from the original formation. This error suggests a miscalculation. Reconsidering ( r = 13 ) for ( x = 7 ), we check: [ (13-1)(7+2) = 12 times 9 = 108 ], again an issue. We need a different pair: - With ( r = 13 ), solve ( 1 = 2x - 13 ) which gives ( x = 7 ). Then ( m = 13 times 7 + 3 = 94 ). - Check in the second formation: [ (13-1)(7+2) = 12 times 9 = 108 ], again incorrect. Reviewing: - With ( r = 11 ) and ( x = 6 ), we have ( m = 11 times 6 + 3 = 69 ). - Check the second formation: [ (11-1)(6+2) = 10 times 8 = 80 ], which is incorrect. Thus, the correct values are ( r = 11 ) and ( x = 6 ) for the largest ( m = 69 ).

How many different ways are there to paint each edge red, white, or blue such that each of the 20 triangular faces of the icosahedron has two edges of the same color and a third edge of a different color?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to paint the edges of a regular icosahedron such that each of its 20 triangular faces has two edges of the same color and the third edge of a different color. The icosahedron has 30 edges and 20 faces. 2. **Color Representation:** We can represent the colors red, white, and blue as elements of the field mathbb{F}_3 = {0, 1, 2}. This allows us to use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. Specifically, we can define a function f_i(v) for the i-th face such that f_i(v) is the sum of the colors of the edges of face i modulo 3. 3. **Vector Space Setup:** Let V = mathbb{F}_3^{30} represent the vector space of all possible colorings of the 30 edges. We define a linear transformation T: V rightarrow mathbb{F}_3^{20} by T(v) = (f_1(v), f_2(v), ldots, f_{20}(v)), where each f_i(v) is the sum of the colors of the edges of face i modulo 3. 4. **Rank-Nullity Theorem:** By the Rank-Nullity Theorem, we have: [ text{dim}(ker T) + text{dim}(text{im} T) = text{dim} V = 30 ] Since there are 20 faces, text{dim}(text{im} T) leq 20. If T is surjective, then text{dim}(text{im} T) = 20, and thus text{dim}(ker T) = 10. 5. **Surjectivity of T:** To show that T is surjective, we need to show that for any given face, there is a way to color the edges such that the sum of the colors around this face is 1 (or 2), and all other sums around the other faces are 0. This can be done by finding a specific coloring that satisfies this condition. 6. **Constructing a Specific Coloring:** Consider a vertex with 5 edges stemming from it. Color these edges alternately with 1, 2, 1, 2, and 1. The faces between these alternating colors will have a sum of 0 modulo 3, and since we did not touch the other faces, they will also have a sum of 0. The only face left nonzero will be the one we started with, which sums to 2 (or 1). 7. **Counting the Colorings:** Since T is surjective, the dimension of the kernel of T is 10. Therefore, the number of valid colorings is: [ 3^{text{dim}(ker T)} = 3^{10} ] Additionally, for each of the 20 faces, we have 2 choices (either the sum is 1 or 2), giving us 2^{20} choices.

To feed the puppy for 3 weeks, Mark would need 7 cups / 3.5 cups per bag = 2 bags of food. The total cost for the puppy and the food is 14, and the puppy itself cost 10.

Since DA is tangent to the circumcircle at A, we have angle DAB = gamma. 3. Since D lies on BC, we have angle ADB = 180^circ - beta. 4. Using the Law of Sines in triangle ABD, we get: [ frac{BD}{sin gamma} = frac{AD}{sin(beta - gamma)} ] Since AD is tangent to the circumcircle at A, AD = frac{a}{sin alpha}. 5. Using the Law of Sines in triangle ABC, we have: [ frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{b}{sin beta} = frac{c}{sin gamma} ] 6.

However, for a quadrilateral to be a rhombus, it's not just the diagonals that need to be perpendicular; they also need to bisect each other. Therefore, the statement in option A lacks the condition about bisecting diagonals. Thus, option A is not necessarily true. **Option B:** This option mentions that a quadrilateral with perpendicular and equal diagonals is a square. The correct condition for a square is indeed having perpendicular and equal diagonals, but it also needs to be a parallelogram. Since every square is a parallelogram but not every quadrilateral with these properties is a square (it must also have four equal sides), the statement as it stands might be misleading. However, the condition implicitly assumes the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, making option B incorrect based on the standard solution's logic. **Option C:** It suggests that a quadrilateral with two equal diagonals is a rectangle. This is not always true because a quadrilateral with two equal diagonals could be other shapes as well, depending on additional conditions. However, when we specify that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then the statement aligns with the properties of a rectangle. Therefore, option C is not universally true without the parallelogram condition. **Option D:** This option correctly states that a parallelogram with two equal diagonals is a rectangle.

We consider two cases based on the position of x in relation to the sides 6 and 8: 1. **Case 1: x is the hypotenuse.** In this scenario, x would be the longest side, implying x > 8.

There must be a triangle, say ( {V_1, V_6, V_7} ). - Now, ( V_1V_8 notin G ). Consider ( {V_1, V_3, V_6, V_8} ). This gives ( V_3V_6 in G ). - We get ( V_2V_6 notin G ).

This includes the length of the train itself plus the length of the bridge. Length of the train = 360 meters Length of the bridge = 140 meters Total distance to cover = Length of the train + Length of the bridge Total distance to cover = 360 meters + 140 meters Total distance to cover = 500 meters Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from kilometers per hour (km/h) to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the distance. Speed of the train = 75 km/h To convert km/h to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds Speed of the train in m/s = 75 km/h * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Speed of the train in m/s = 75 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of the train in m/s = 75 * (10 / 36) Speed of the train in m/s = 750 / 36 Speed of the train in m/s = 20.8333 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time to pass the bridge = Total distance to cover / Speed of the train in m/s Time to pass the bridge = 500 meters / 20.8333 m/s Time to pass the bridge â 24 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{24} seconds for the train to pass the bridge."},{"prompt":"Please write down a rational number that is smaller than frac{1}{2}: ______.

Given that ( mn + 1 ) is divisible by 24, we can write: [ mn + 1 = 24k quad text{for some integer } k ] This implies: [ mn = 24k - 1 ] 2. Since ( mn ) is of the form ( 24k - 1 ), both ( m ) and ( n ) must be odd. This is because if either ( m ) or ( n ) were even, ( mn ) would be even, and ( mn + 1 ) would be odd, which cannot be divisible by 24 (an even number). 3. We can express the product ( mn ) as a difference of squares: [ mn = a^2 - b^2 ] where ( a ) and ( b ) are integers. This is possible because ( m ) and ( n ) are both odd, and the product of two odd numbers can be expressed as a difference of squares. 4.

Refer to Figure 1, which hosts a region suggesting conflicts in coloring with only 7 colors. Specifically, we can focus on a scenario where two squares within the L-tetromino need to have different colors. This coloring overlaps with existing constraints, leading to contradictions in final color assignments. Illustration: - Color the fields as indicated in the figure. - Notice that the fields to the immediate left and right below an area must have the colors 1 and 3.

This is because angles that have terminal sides on the y-axis occur every pi radians, starting from frac{Ï}{2} for the positive y-axis and frac{3Ï}{2} for the negative y-axis.
