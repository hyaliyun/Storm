Here, the sequence is just [1], and the number 1 is already in the first position. Thus, the hypothesis holds for ( n=1 ). 2. **Inductive Step:** - Suppose the hypothesis holds for any sequence of ( n-1 ) natural numbers. That is, for any sequence of length ( n-1 ), the process described ensures that the number 1 can be moved to the first position. - We will prove that the hypothesis also holds for any sequence of ( n ) natural numbers. 3. **Applying the Inductive Hypothesis:** - Consider the sequence ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) ). If the number ( n ) is at the last position ( a_n = n ), then we can use our hypothesis for the first ( n-1 ) numbers ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1}) ). - By the inductive hypothesis, we can rearrange ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1}) ) such that the number 1 moves to the first position with ( n ) remaining at the last position which maintains our solution as ( (1, ldots, ldots, n) ). 4. **Handling the General Case:** - If the number ( n ) is not at the last position, i.e., ( a_n neq n ), then we initiate the transformation process. This process is defined as follows: if any number ( k ) is at the first position ( a_1 ), we reverse the first ( k ) numbers in the sequence. - We continue repeating this transformation. The key observation is that after a finite number of swaps, the larger numbers will naturally gravitate toward their final positions due to the decreasing order of potential swaps possible by design. 5. **Ensuring the Number 1 Moves to Position 1:** - With repeated transformations, other numbers in the sequence will eventually stabilize in their positions except for 1. Any number other than 1 that starts in position 1 gets moved away by a subsequent swap, recursively pushing 1 towards the first position as '1' is the smallest and gets swapped the quickest and rarely displaced once it starts positioning movement. 6. **Conclusion for ( n = 1993 ):** - By induction, it implies that after a finite series of mechanical reversals and rearrangements, it is possible for the number 1 to be at the first position in the sequence of length 1993.

We'll prove this in several steps, exploring different cases based on geometric configurations. I. Geometric Analysis Let's consider the half-planes defined by their boundary lines classified into different cases: 1. **Two Parallel Lines (Case (0))** - Here, one half-plane completely covers the other one. Thus, having both is redundant. We can ignore this case as removing the redundant half-plane still leaves the task of covering the plane simplified. 2. **Intersecting Lines (Cases (1), (2), and (3))** - When two lines intersect, they create more complex configurations: - **Case (1): Wedge regions left uncovered.** - **Case (2): Strip regions left uncovered.** - **Case (3): Line (common boundary) left uncovered.** II. Adding a Third Half-Plane When introducing a third half-plane to cover the remaining uncovered regions, more configurations appear: - For Example: - **From Case (1), we get sub-cases I/a, I/b, and I/c.** - **From Case (2), we get configuration II.** - **From Case (3), we get configuration III.** In these sub-configurations, multiple boundary lines intersect at points, creating isolated uncovered regions. III. Simplification of Configurations Certain configurations can be simplified: - **Case I/c:** Where three boundary lines intersect at a single point, we can slightly adjust one half-plane to simplify it back to Case I/a. - **Case III:** By slightly shifting two half-planes with common boundaries, we can simplify back to Case II. Thus, only three main configurations need to be considered before introducing the fourth half-plane. IV. Introduction of the Fourth Half-Plane Finally, when a fourth half-plane is added: - **If Parallel to an Existing Boundary Line:** This immediately covers the remaining region completely, making one of the other half-planes redundant. - **If Non-Parallel:** Identify the point of nearest intersection (vertex of uncovered regions). The fourth half-plane along with the other two will form complete coverage of the plane. Hence, in both scenarios, three half-planes are sufficient to achieve a full coverage of the plane. Conclusion: From the above reasoning and geometrical setup, it proves that it is always possible to select three out of four half-planes to ensure they cover the entire plane. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The minimum value of the function y=(x1)^2 is ____.","completion":"The key point: Properties of quadratic functions.

A:B:C = 6300/2100 : 4200/2100 : 10500/2100 A:B:C = 3 : 2 : 5 Now, we know that A's share of the profit is Rs. 4260, which corresponds to the '3' parts in the ratio. Let's denote the total profit as 'P'. According to the ratio, A's share of the total profit is 3/10 (since 3+2+5=10 parts in total). So, A's share (3/10 of P) is Rs. 4260. Now we can set up the equation: (3/10) * P = 4260 To find P, we multiply both sides of the equation by 10/3: P = 4260 * (10/3) P = 4260 * 10 / 3 P = 42600 / 3 P = Rs. 14200 Therefore, the total profit is Rs. boxed{14200} ."},{"prompt":"order to strictly control the quality of products, a factory randomly selects 50 out of 500 products for inspection.

Hence, we want to evaluate (1omega^0 + 2omega^1 + ldots + 2015omega^{2014}). 2. Consider the polynomial (P(x) = frac{x^{2016} - 1}{x - 1} = x^{2015} + x^{2014} + ldots + 1). Then, [ P'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( frac{x^{2016} - 1}{x - 1} right) ] Using the quotient rule, we get: [ P'(x) = frac{(2016x^{2015})(x - 1) - (x^{2016} - 1)}{(x - 1)^2} = frac{2016x^{2015}(x - 1) - (x^{2016} - 1)}{(x - 1)^2} ] Simplifying the numerator: [ P'(x) = frac{2016x^{2015}x - 2016x^{2015} - x^{2016} + 1}{(x - 1)^2} = frac{2015x^{2016} - 2016x^{2015} + 1}{(x - 1)^2} ] This simplifies to: [ P'(x) = 2015x^{2014} + 2014x^{2013} + ldots + 1 ] 3.

Let (a) be the number at the first vertex. Then, the numbers at the vertices can be written as follows: - First vertex: (a) - Second vertex: (sigma(1) - a) - Third vertex: (sigma(2) - (sigma(1) - a) = sigma(2) - sigma(1) + a) - Fourth vertex: (sigma(3) - (sigma(2) - sigma(1) + a) = sigma(3) - sigma(2) + sigma(1) - a) - Continue this pattern until the (n)-th vertex. When we return to the first vertex, we must have: [ a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) + (-1)^n a ] Since (n) is odd, ((-1)^n = -1), so we get: [ a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) - a ] This simplifies to: [ 2a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) ] Thus, (a) can be determined as: [ a = frac{1}{2} left( sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) right) ] Therefore, for any permutation (sigma), we can always find a suitable (a), and hence it is possible for all odd (n). 2. **Case 2: ( n ) is even** When (n) is even, we obtain a similar system, but now the (a)s cancel out. We have: [ a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) + (-1)^n a ] Since (n) is even, ((-1)^n = 1), so we get: [ a = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) + a ] This simplifies to: [ 0 = sigma(n) - sigma(n-1) + sigma(n-2) - cdots + (-1)^{n-1} sigma(1) ] Therefore, we must have: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} (-1)^i sigma(i) = 0 ] Working modulo 2, this implies that (n equiv 0 pmod{4}).

Thus, if {E}, {F}, {G} each has n=2 students, a valid group can be selected naturally. 4. **Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that the hypothesis holds for some n=k, where we can form groups such that, in each group, each language is spoken by precisely 2 students. 5. **Inductive Step:** Now, show that if each language is spoken by k+2 students, the problem also holds: - Consider {s_1}, {s_2}, {s_3}, {s_4}, {s_5} as groups of students. - Create a group where each language L has exactly 2 speakers per reduced collective. - This reduces k+2 to k and applying the induction hypothesis resolves it for k. 6. **General Construction: Apply Repetitively:** By applying the above reduction repeatedly, each k reduces to eventually 2, which holds by base case assumption.

After that, it will bounce back up to a height of 0.8h (80% of the original height), then fall back down the same distance of 0.8h. This process will continue indefinitely, with the ball reaching 80% of the previous height on each bounce. To calculate the total distance covered by the ball, we need to sum the distances of all the bounces. The total distance D can be expressed as an infinite geometric series: D = h + 2(0.8h) + 2(0.8^2h) + 2(0.8^3h) + ... This is a geometric series with the first term a = h and the common ratio r = 2 * 0.8 = 1.6. However, since the ball is not bouncing back to the full height, we need to adjust the common ratio for the subsequent terms after the initial drop. The correct common ratio for the bounce distances is r = 0.8. So the series becomes: D = h + 2(0.8h) + 2(0.8^2h) + 2(0.8^3h) + ... To find the sum of this infinite geometric series, we use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, which is: S = a / (1 - r) where S is the sum of the series, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio. In this case, the first term a is not just h, but h + 2(0.8h), because the first bounce up and down is included in the first term. So we have: a = h + 2(0.8h) = h + 1.6h = 2.6h The common ratio r is 0.8 (for the bounce distances). Now we can find the sum of the series: S = a / (1 - r) S = 2.6h / (1 - 0.8) S = 2.6h / 0.2 S = 13h So the total distance covered by the ball is boxed{13} times the original height h from which it was dropped."},{"prompt":"A werewolf moves on an infinitely large grid.

A comprehensive survey would involve all 2000 students. Therefore, statement A is incorrect. - **Statement B**: This statement directly mentions that the sample size is 200.

Hence, statement B is correct. - **Statement C**: It claims that the 2000 students are the population. This is a correct understanding of the term \\"population\\" in the context of statistical analysis. The population refers to the entire group that is the subject of the study, which in this case, is the 2000 students.

In statistical terms, each selected student can indeed be referred to as an individual or a subject of the study. However, the solution suggests that it's the vision of each student that is considered an individual. This seems to be a misunderstanding of the terminology. In the context of the survey, it would be more accurate to say that each student's vision is a data point or observation rather than calling the student an individual.

Given that the sum of the first n terms S_n of {a_{n}} satisfies -2 < S_n < 2, we know that the sequence converges because the sum is bounded.

To make the function y = sin 2x resemble y = sin x, we therefore have to address the horizontal stretching caused by the factor of 2 and shift the graph horizontally so that it starts its cycle at the same point as y = sin x. The standard sine function, y = sin x, starts its cycle at x = 0. The function y = sin 2x also starts a cycle at x = 0. However, due to the stretching factor, one full cycle of y = sin 2x is completed at x = pi instead of at x = 2pi for y = sin x.

When the selling price per piece is decreased to 50 yuan, the decrease in price from the original is 60 - 50 = 10 yuan. The increase in sales volume for every 5 yuan decrease is calculated as frac{10}{5} times 10 = 2 times 10 = 20 pieces.

From Clue 4, since 2 and 6 are not correct (from Clue 2 and Clue 5), 9 must be the correct number, but it is not in the middle position. Since from Clue 1, we know that 9 is in the correct position, it must be the last digit. From Clue 5, since 6 is not correct and 7 cannot be in the middle position (because 9 is the last digit and from Clue 1, 7 or 9 is in the correct position), 8 must be the correct number but not in the last position. This means 8 is the first digit. So, we have 8 as the first digit, 9 as the last digit. From Clue 3, we know 1 is also correct but not in the first or last position, so it must be the middle digit.

Thus, the sum in the square bracket is divisible by 11. Hence, ( A ) will be divisible by 11 if and only if the sum of the digits ( a_{0} + a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{n} ) is divisible by 11.

Therefore, ( (12^{2k} - 1) ) and ( (12^{2k-1} + 1) ) are always divisible by ( 12 + 1 = 13 ). Thus, the sum on the right-hand side is divisible by 13.

Thus, no such triangle exists. 2. **Quadrilaterals (n = 4)**: - Consider a convex quadrilateral with sides ( a, b, c, d ). - The sum of the internal angles is ( 360^circ ). - Given that the sines of all angles are equal, each angle is either ( varphi ) or ( 180^circ - varphi ). - This leads to the scenarios of the quadrilateral either being a rectangle, a parallelogram, or an isosceles trapezoid. - If we analyze these shapes, all sides cannot be different while maintaining equal sine values of angles. - **Formal Proof**: - By area calculation: - Consider a way to divide the quadrilateral into two triangles along a diagonal. - Let the lengths of the sides opposite the diagonal in these triangles be ( (a, c) ) and ( (b, d) ). - Using the sine rule for area calculation: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} ab sin theta + frac{1}{2} cd sin theta ] or similarly, [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} ad sin theta + frac{1}{2} bc sin theta ] - Equating these two forms, [ ab + cd = ad + bc quad text{or} quad (a - c)(b - d) = 0 ] - This implies that at least one pair of sides are equal, contradicting the requirement for all sides to be different. 3. **Pentagons (n = 5)**: - Let’s consider a convex pentagon. - Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is ( 108^circ ). - Modify a regular pentagon such that the angles and sides are varied but maintaining the equal sines property. - It is possible to start with an isosceles trapezoid with angles ( 60^circ ) and modify it to form a pentagon by inserting extra vertices, ensuring the sines of angles are kept constant. - **Illustrative Construction**: - From an isosceles trapezoid with the appropriate angle, cut off a segment to create additional vertices. Conclusion: Thus, by analyzing the problem and trying smaller values, we confirm that the smallest ( n ) for which such a polygon can exist is a pentagon.

The slope of a vertical line is undefined. However, for the sake of this problem where we assume to calculate and combine characteristics of the line, let's focus on the x-intercept and redefine the slope of a vertical line as infinite theoretically. In a practical sense, a vertical line has an equation of the form x = k, where k is the constant x-coordinate. For points C and D, this constant is 8. Therefore, the equation of the line is x=8 and the x-intercept is straightforwardly 8. To engage with the problem in a meaningful way, we consider adding the x-intercept to the absolute value of the undefined slope. Theoretically, the slope can be treated as extremely large.

We start with the given equation that represents the sum of angles in a triangle, specifically an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, two angles are equal (the base angles), and the third angle is the vertex angle. The exterior angle of one of the base angles is given as y degrees. The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, the equation can be written as: [ x + (180 - y) + (180 - y) = 180 ] This equation represents the sum of the vertex angle x and the two base angles. The base angles are calculated as the supplementary angles to the exterior angle y, hence (180 - y). 2. Simplifying the equation, we combine like terms and solve for y: [ x + 360 - 2y = 180 ] Subtracting 360 from both sides to isolate terms involving y: [ x - 180 = -2y ] Dividing by -2 to solve for y: [ frac{x - 180}{-2} = y ] Simplifying further, we get: [ y = 90 + frac{x}{2} ] Therefore, the function expression of y in terms of x is y = 90 + frac{x}{2}.

Therefore, we have our first contradiction, and a cannot be 0. 2. The only element in the set on the left that can be a^2 is a itself, which implies a = a^2 or a^2 - a = a(a - 1) = 0, giving us two potential solutions for a: 0 or 1. But as we've already established that a cannot be 0, we are left with a = 1. 3. However, if a = 1, then frac{b}{a} = b must match with either 0 or a + b.

Checking again for a = 0 is impossible as it would make the term frac{b}{a} undefined. However, we missed another root from a(a - 1) = 0, which is a = -1.

We need to show that this condition is equivalent to A B C being an equilateral triangle. 2. **Basics of Rotation**: Recall that j = e^{2pi i / 3} is a complex number representing a rotation by 120^circ counterclockwise. The cube roots of unity are 1, j, j^2, where j^3 = 1 and 1+j+j^2 = 0.

Multiplying a complex number by j corresponds to rotating it by 120^circ counterclockwise. Therefore, if triangle ABC is equilateral, then the coordinates must be related through a 120^circ rotation. 4. **Equilateral Triangle Condition**: For triangle ABC to be equilateral, the rotation of 120^circ around each point should align with the other two points.

Let a line e_1 intersecting the arms of the right angle at A_1 and B_1 be such that: [ frac{1}{C A_1} + frac{1}{C B_1} = k ] 2. Reflect the given diagram across the perpendicular bisector f of the right angle. Upon reflection, the arms of the right angle map onto each other. Let A_2 and B_2 be the points where the reflection of e_1, denoted as e_2, intersects CA_1 and CB_1, respectively. Clearly, CA_2 = CB_1 and CB_2 = CA_1. Thus, e_2 will also satisfy the given condition. 3. As a result, the intersection point M of e_1 and e_2 must be a point invariant under the reflection, as it lies on line f. Now calculate the perpendicular distance from M to the arms of the right angle. 4. Let M' be the projection of M onto CA_1. Using the similarity of the right-angled triangles A_1B_1C and A_1MM', noting that triangle CMM' is isosceles: [ frac{M'M}{CB_1} = frac{M'A_1}{CA_1} = frac{CA_1 - CM'}{CA_1} = 1 - frac{M'M}{CA_1} ] 5. Rearrange and solve using (1): [ M'Mleft( frac{1}{CA_1} + frac{1}{CB_1} right) = k cdot M'M = 1 ] Therefore, [ M'M = frac{1}{k} ] 6. Since M'M is constant and independent of the position of e_1, it follows that every line satisfying the given condition intersects the fixed point M at distance 1/k from the arms of the right angle. Hence, all such lines pass through M. Thus, the statement is proven and the constant point is determined. blacksquare **Second Approach:** 1. Consider the positive axes of a right-angled coordinate system as the arms of the right angle. Suppose the line e_1 satisfies the given condition and has the equation y = m_1 x + b_1. Then it intersects the positive Y-axis at (B_1(0, b_1)) and the positive X-axis at (A_1(a_1, 0)). 2. Given: [ frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{b_1} = k ] Using the fact that ( m_1 = -frac{b_1}{a_1} ), we rewrite the line equation in intercept form: [ y = -frac{b_1}{a_1} x + b_1 quad text{or} quad frac{x}{a_1} + frac{y}{b_1} = 1 ] 3.

Using: [ a_1 + b_1 = k a_1 b_1 quad text{and} quad a_2 + b_2 = k a_2 b_2 ] Simplify the numerators for x and y: [ a_1 a_2 b_2 - a_1 b_1 a_2 = frac{1}{k} left[ a_1(a_2 + b_2) - (a_1 + b_1)a_2 right] = frac{1}{k} (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1) ] Similarly, [ b_1 b_2 a_2 - b_1 a_1 b_2 = frac{1}{k} left[ b_1(a_2 + b_2) - (a_1 + b_1)b_2 right] = frac{1}{k} (a_2 b_1 - a_1 b_2) ] This simplifies to: [ x_M = frac{1}{k}, quad y_M = frac{1}{k} ] 6. Simplification was valid as a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 = 0 would imply b_2 / a_2 = b_1 / a_1, making the lines parallel and identical for valid conditions. Thus, the intersection point remains independent of specific coordinates of a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, i.e., all such lines intersect at the fixed point ( left( frac{1}{k}, frac{1}{k} right) ). Thus, the proposition is verified to be correct even when arms extend, considering negative extensions.

Let's denote the total taxable value of the village's land as V and the total taxable value of Mr. William's land as W.

Therefore, 12^m - 5^n is always odd. Also, neither 12^m nor 5^n is divisible by 3 or 5 as 12 and 5 are not coprime to 3 and 5 respectively. 2. **Modular Arithmetic:** We use modular arithmetic to derive more insights into the expression 12^m - 5^n. Notice: [ 12^m equiv 0 pmod{4} quad text{and} quad 5^n equiv 1 pmod{4} ] Thus, [ 12^m - 5^n equiv 0 - 1 equiv -1 pmod{4} ] This means that 12^m - 5^n equiv 3 pmod{4} since -1 equiv 3 pmod{4}. 3. **Considering Smaller Values:** Next, we test smaller values for m and n to find the smallest expression.

If a^2 = a and -1 = b, solving a^2 = a gives a^2 - a = 0, which implies a(a - 1) = 0. This means a = 0 or a = 1.

We need to determine whether the initial set of numbers could have been ((2, 2, 2)) or ((3, 3, 3)). 1. **Backward Construction:** We start from ((17, 1967, 1983)) and trace back to see how these numbers could have been formed. First, observe the following: [ 1983 = 1967 + 17 - 1 ] Thus, before this step, the numbers could have been ((17, 1967, 1951)) because: [ 1967 + 1951 = 3918 - 1 = 1983 ] Similarly, [ 1967 = 1951 + 17 - 1 ] Hence, before this step, the numbers could have been ((17, 1951, 1935)) because: [ 1951 + 1935 = 3886 - 1 = 1967 ] Continue this process: [ 1951 = 1935 + 17 - 1 Rightarrow (17, 1935, 1919) ] Continue this process until no further substitutions can be made. 2. **Summarizing the Backward Steps:** Following the pattern, we get: [ 1983 = 1935 + 3 cdot 17 - 3 ] Therefore, [ 1983 = 31 + 122 cdot 17 - 122 ] Similarly, [ 1967 = 15 + 122 cdot 17 - 122 ] So, through 123 transformations, we can obtain: [ (17, 1967, 1983) leftarrow (17, 15, 31) ] 3. **Transforming Further Back:** Continue tracing back the solutions: [ (17, 15, 31) leftarrow (17, 15, 3) leftarrow (13, 15, 3) leftarrow (13, 11, 3) dots leftarrow (9, 7, 3) leftarrow (7, 5, 3) leftarrow (5, 3, 3) leftarrow (3, 3, 3) ] Hence, if we continue the backward substitutions, we eventually reach ((3, 3, 3)). 4. **Checking Initial Condition (2, 2, 2):** We will perform a similar backward process starting from ((17, 1967, 1983)) and attempt to see if we ever reach ((2, 2, 2)).

We know these weights can be divided into k equal-mass groups, i.e., the total mass of all weights can be evenly divided by k. 2. **Box Division**: We'll use two boxes for the initial division of weights. Let's distribute the weights such that the first box contains fewer than k weights. 3. **Weight Separation by Divisibility**: - Begin by taking weights such that their masses are **not** divisible by k. If there are fewer than k of such weights, place them in the first box, then proceed to the next step. If there are k or more of such weights, put all these weights in the second box. - Next, from the remaining weights, take those that are divisible by k but **not** by k^2. Repeat the process: - If these new weights fit in the first box so that it still contains fewer than k weights, place them there. - If they don't fit in the first box, or if we've already moved to the second box, place all these weights in the second box. - Continue this process with weights divisible by higher powers of k, such as k^2, k^3, etc., until all weights are distributed between the two boxes. 4. **Ensuring a Weight in Second Box**: Since the total number of weights is at least k, some weights will inevitably be placed in the second box, ensuring that at least one complete even-mass group cannot be formed in the first box alone. This implies that the second box will contain weights, whose collective divisibility properties we will examine. 5. **Weights Grouped by Divisibility**: Consider the group of weights from the second box where all weights are divisible by k^r but **not** by k^{r+1}. Thus, any complete valid group (one of the k groups) needs to have their total mass divisible by k^r but not necessarily by higher powers. 6. **Total Mass Divisibility**: Since there are k equal groups, the total mass of the weights should be divisible by k^{r+1} if they were divided into k groups before removing a weight. 7. **Impact of Weight Removal**: Suppose we remove a weight whose mass is **not** divisible by k^{r+1}. The remaining weights should still be divisible by k^{r} but no longer by k^{r+1}. If the total mass of the remaining weights is divisible by k^{r+1}, then the removed weight must have contributed to the divisibility by k^{r+1}. 8. **Contradiction and Conclusion**: If fewer than k ways to remove a weight existed, we would be able to form the k equal-weight groups out of the remaining weights. However, given our divisibility conditions, this would contradict the properties ensured by initial divisibility constraints. Therefore, there must be at least k distinct ways to remove one weight, such that the remaining weights cannot be divided into k equal-mass groups. **Conclusion**: [ boxed{text{There are at least } k text{ ways to remove one weight so that the remaining weights cannot be divided into } k text{ equal-mass groups.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Observe the algebraic expressions and their corresponding values in the table below and answer the questions: | x | ldots | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | ldots | ||||||||| | 2x7 | ldots | 11 | 9 | 7 | a | 3 | ldots | | 3x+2 | ldots | 4 | 1 | 2 | 5 | 8 | ldots | | 2x+5 | ldots | 9 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 1 | ldots | | 3x1 | ldots | b | 2 | 1 | 4 | 7 | ldots | (1) [Initial Perception] According to the information in the table, a=______, b=______; when x=______, the value of 3x+2 is 7 greater than the value of 2x+5.

Since ( n, n+2, n+4 ) mod 3 differ, at least one of ( n+4 rightarrow text{is composite} implies f(n+4) + g(n+4) ), will lead to a smaller number eventually. 7. **Conclusion**: Hence, by induction and the heuristic argument, we can assert that there do not exist values of ( k ) such that the duck can reach an infinite number of different integer points.

Show that: pnmid (p1)^n+1","completion":"1. **Key Identity**: We start by using the identity ((m^a - 1, m^b - 1) = m^{gcd(a, b)} - 1). This identity will help us in understanding the divisibility properties of the given expression. 2. **Proving (n) is a power of (p)**: We need to show that (n) must be a power of (p). To do this, we first show that (p mid n). 3. **Assume (p nmid n)**: Suppose (p nmid n). If (n = 1), the condition is trivially satisfied. If (n > 1), let (m^{pn} - 1 = (m^n - 1)q) for some prime (q). 4. **Using the gcd identity**: Note that if (gcd(p, n) = 1), then ((m^p - 1, m^n - 1) = m - 1). Hence, we can write: [ m^{pn} - 1 = ell cdot frac{m^p - 1}{m - 1}(m^n - 1) ] for some (ell > 1).

We have: [ m^{p^{k+1} n_1} - 1 = (m^{p^k n_1} - 1)q ] for some prime (q). 6. **Using the gcd identity again**: Observe that ((m^{p^{k+1}} - 1, m^{p^k n_1} - 1) = m^{p^k} - 1). Hence, for some (ell' > 1), it holds: [ m^{p^{k+1} n_1} - 1 = ell' frac{m^{p^{k+1}} - 1}{m^{p^k} - 1} (m^{p^k n_1} - 1) ] Therefore: [ q = ell' frac{m^{p^{k+1}} - 1}{m^{p^k} - 1} ] Since (n_1 > 1), it follows that (ell' > 1), and thus (q) is never a prime. Hence, (n = p^k). 7. **Using the Lifting The Exponent Lemma**: Finally, we use the Lifting The Exponent Lemma (LTE) to show the divisibility.

Considering the intersections, (MK) and (ML) create smaller triangles within triangle ABC, such as triangle BMK and triangle AML, which are similar to larger triangles triangle BAC and triangle CAB, respectively. 7.

Let's break down the solution step by step, adhering closely to the provided solution but expanding on the reasoning and calculations. 1. **Initial Observation**: - It's clear that none of h, t, u can be 1. If any of them were 1, that painter would paint every picket, leaving no picket for the others to paint without overpainting. 2. **Case Analysis Based on h**: - **Case h=2**: This is not feasible because then Harold would paint the first and every second picket thereafter, including the third picket. However, Ulysses starts with the third picket, leading to overpainting. - **Case h=3**: For this to work without overpainting, both t and u must also be divisible by 3 to avoid painting the pickets Harold paints. Additionally, to ensure the fourth and fifth pickets are painted (by Tanya and Ulysses respectively), t and u must both be 3. Hence, 333 is a paintable number. - **Case h=4**: Here, t must be even to avoid painting Harold's pickets, and similarly, u must be even but cannot be 2 mod 4 to avoid conflict with Harold and Tanya's pattern. Therefore, u must be 0 mod 4, and t must be 2 mod 4. To ensure the fifth and sixth pickets are painted, t=2 and u=4. Thus, 424 is paintable. - **Case h>5**: If h were greater than 5, then the resulting paintable number would exceed 999, which is not possible within the constraints of the problem (considering the format 100h+10t+u). 3. **Conclusion**: - The only paintable numbers under these conditions are 333 and 424. - Summing these gives us the total sum of all paintable numbers: 333 + 424 = 757.

According to the original solution, the tree shed 3/4 of the leaves it had at the start of the third week, which is 3/4 times 360 = 270 leaves, not 3/4 times the number of leaves shed in the second week. Let's correct this and conclude: - Correct calculation for the third week: [ 3/4 times 360 = 270 text{ leaves}. ] - Therefore, the number of leaves remaining after the third week is: [ 360 - 270 = 90 text{ leaves}. ] So, the correct final answer, following the original solution and correcting the step-by-step explanation, is: [ boxed{90} text{ leaves}. ]"},{"prompt":"Prove that in a regular nonagon, the length of the longest diagonal is equal to the sum of the side length and the shortest diagonal.","completion":"**First Solution:** 1. Let a denote the side length, b denote the length of the shorter diagonal, c denote the length of the longer diagonal, and r denote the radius of the circumscribed circle of a regular nonagon. 2. We know that the central angle corresponding to one side of a regular nonagon is 40^circ. Hence, the central angle corresponding to b is 80^circ, and the one corresponding to c is 160^circ. 3. Using the properties of circumscribed circles, we have: [ a = 2r sin 20^circ, quad b = 2r sin 40^circ, quad c = 2r sin 80^circ ] 4. To prove the equation (a + b = c), use the sum-to-product identities: [ sin x + sin y = 2 sin left( frac{x + y}{2} right) cos left( frac{x - y}{2} right) ] Set (x = 40^circ) and (y = 20^circ): [ sin 40^circ + sin 20^circ = 2 sin 30^circ cos 10^circ ] 5. We know that: [ sin 30^circ = frac{1}{2} ] and [ cos 10^circ = sin 80^circ ] 6. Therefore, [ 2 sin 30^circ cos 10^circ = 2 cdot frac{1}{2} cdot sin 80^circ = sin 80^circ ] 7. This completes the proof since ( sin 40^circ + sin 20^circ = sin 80^circ). Hence, (a + b = c). **Second Solution:** 1. Consider the lines ( AB ) and ( ED ) which intersect at a point ( P ). 2. Note the angles ( angle BAE ) and ( angle DEA ) are hence both ( frac{1}{2} times 3 times 40^circ = 60^circ ). 3. Because ( triangle PAE ) is isosceles and symmetric with respect to the axis of symmetry of the nonagon, it is also equilateral. 4. Since lines ( BD parallel AE ), the triangle ( triangle BPD ) is equilateral, confirming ( BP = BD = AC ). - This follows because ( AC ) and ( BD ) are both diagonals of a regular nonagon that connect every second vertex. In summary, both methods confirm that the length of the longest diagonal of a regular nonagon equals the sum of the side length and the shortest diagonal.

To prove this, we utilize the rearrangement inequality which states that for non-negative (x, y, z): [ sum x^3 geq sum x^2 y ] and [ sum x^3 geq sum y^2 x. ] This is evident since (sum x^3) is already larger as each (x^3) term has a higher degree of magnitude compared to the respective mixed terms. 4. Therefore, by adding the inequalities derived from the rearrangement principle: [ 2 sum x^3 geq sum x^2 y + sum y^2 x. ] 5. Specifically, more detailed: [ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 geq x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x, ] and [ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 geq x^2 z + y^2 x + z^2 y. ] Adding these two inequalities we get: [ 2(x^3 + y^3 + z^3) geq x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x + x^2 z + y^2 x + z^2 y. ] 6.

We need to show that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle B_1C_1A_1. 4. Consider the arcs smile AB, smile AC_1, and smile C_1B on the circumcircle. 5. By the properties of Brocard points, we know that: [ smile AB = smile AC_1 + smile C_1B ] Additionally, since the points B_1 and C_1 are determined by the intersection of lines PB and PC with the circumcircle, we have: [ smile AB = smile AB_1 + smile AC_1 ] 6.

By addressing the rotational and reflective symmetry of the triangles inscribed in circle S, we attempt to find out under how many different positions the triangle A_1B_1C_1 can coincide with triangle ABC. 4. There exist two Brocard points relative to triangle ABC; hence the triangles B_1C_1A_1 and C_1A_1B_1 are directly representable when considering these points. 5. Since we are considering a rotational and reflective symmetry, triangles ABC and A_1B_1C_1 can be equivalent under 12 possible configurations due to the Brocard construction's two-point symmetry. 6. Out of these 12 configurations, only 8 unique points P can exist where triangle A_1B_1C_1 can be congruent to triangle ABC due to the combinatory actions for unique equivalent configurations.

When x_2 = 35, 100 - 2(x - 25) = 80 > 75, thus, the answer is that a total of boxed{35} people participated in this spring outing."},{"prompt":"1) Prove that if the midlines of a quadrilateral are equal, then its diagonals are perpendicular, and conversely. 2) Prove that if the midlines of a quadrilateral are perpendicular, then its diagonals are equal, and conversely.","completion":"To prove the given statements, we will use the properties of the midlines in a quadrilateral and the relationships they have with diagonals. Midlines in a quadrilateral form specific shapes under certain conditions, which will be pivotal for our proof. Statement 1: If the midlines of a quadrilateral are equal, then its diagonals are perpendicular, and conversely. 1. Let ( ABCD ) be a quadrilateral with midlines ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ). Suppose ( M_1 = M_2 ). 2. Since the midlines are equal, it implies that when joined, the midpoints form a parallelogram ( PQRS ), and given ( M_1 = M_2 ), this parallelogram ( PQRS ) is actually a rectangle due to the equality of opposite sides and right angles. 3. By the properties of midlines, each midline of the quadrilateral is parallel to one pair of opposite sides and half their length. Thus, the vertices of the quadrilateral ( ABCD ) are connected such that ( (A, C) ) and ( (B, D) ) are diagonals crossing at the center of the rectangle. 4. Rectangles have perpendicular diagonals. Therefore, the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) of ( ABCD ) are perpendicular. **Converse:** 1. Suppose the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) of quadrilateral ( ABCD ) are perpendicular. 2. The midlines ( M ) connecting the midpoints of ( AB ) and ( CD ), and ( N ) connecting the midpoints of ( AD ) and ( BC ) will be equal because those lines form right triangles within the overarching rectangle formed by the diagonals (AC) and (BD). 3. Consequently, if the diagonals are perpendicular, the midlines are equal. Thus, the first statement is proved. Statement 2: If the midlines of a quadrilateral are perpendicular, then its diagonals are equal, and conversely. 1. Suppose ( ABCD ) is a quadrilateral with perpendicular midlines ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ). 2. The perpendicularity of the midlines ( M_1 ) and ( M_2 ) implies that when they intersect, they form a rhombus ( PQRS ). 3. By properties of midlines, the midpoints of the sides of the quadrilateral form a rhombus, meaning the diagonals of quadrilateral ( ABCD ) split each other into equal lengths. 4. Since a rhombus' diagonals bisect each other at right angles and the midlines of our quadrilateral are perpendicular, it follows that diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) must be equal for the midlines to preserve perpendicularity. **Converse:** 1. Suppose the diagonals ( AC ) and ( BD ) of quadrilateral ( ABCD ) are equal. 2. The midlines ( M ) and ( N ) will be perpendicular because the intersection of the diagonals at equal lengths ensures the formation of right-angled sides within the rhombus ( PQRS ). 3. Therefore, equal diagonals result in perpendicular midlines, confirming our implication. Thus, the second statement is proved. \`\`\`{=latex} blacksquare \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"f line l_1: ax+2y+a+3=0 is parallel to line l_2: x+(a+1)y+4=0, then the value of the real number a is ( ) A: 1 B: 2 C: 1 or 2 D: 1 or 2","completion":"Since l_1: ax+2y+a+3=0 and l_2: x+(a+1)y+4=0 are parallel, denoted as l_1 parallel l_2, we have frac{a}{1} = frac{2}{a+1} neq frac{a+3}{4}.

When the boat is going downstream, its effective speed is the sum of its own speed and the speed of the stream. Therefore, the downstream speed is 30 kmph (boat's speed) + 10 kmph (stream's speed) = 40 kmph. When the boat is going upstream, its effective speed is its own speed minus the speed of the stream. Therefore, the upstream speed is 30 kmph (boat's speed) - 10 kmph (stream's speed) = 20 kmph. We are given that the boat can cover 40 km upstream in the same time it takes to cover D km downstream. Let's denote the time taken to cover the distances as T hours. For upstream, we can write the equation: Time = Distance / Speed T = 40 km / 20 kmph For downstream, we can write the equation: T = D km / 40 kmph Since the time taken for both upstream and downstream is the same, we can equate the two equations: 40 km / 20 kmph = D km / 40 kmph Now, we can solve for D: (40 km / 20 kmph) * 40 kmph = D km (2 hours) * 40 kmph = D km D = 80 km Therefore, the distance the boat can cover downstream is boxed{80} km."},{"prompt":"Darryl is an inventor who just designed a new machine.

Simplify each term using properties of exponents (power of a power): [ = 3^{frac{1}{3}} cdot 3^{frac{2}{9}} cdot 3^{frac{3}{27}} cdots ] 4. Combine the exponents of (3) since the base is common: [ = 3^{left(frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{9} + frac{3}{27} + cdotsright)} ] 5. Define ( S ) as the sum of the series in the exponent: [ S = frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{9} + frac{3}{27} + cdots ] 6. Recognize that this is a series of the form: [ S = sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{n}{3^n} ] 7. Let ( M = sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{n}{3^n} ). Multiply ( M ) by (frac{1}{3}): [ frac{M}{3} = sum_{n=1}^{infty} frac{n}{3^{n+1}} = frac{1}{3^2} + frac{2}{3^3} + frac{3}{3^4} + cdots ] 8. Subtract (frac{M}{3}) from (M): [ M - frac{M}{3} = left( frac{1}{3} + frac{2}{3^2} + frac{3}{3^3} + cdots right) - left( frac{1}{3^2} + frac{2}{3^3} + frac{3}{3^4} + cdots right) ] 9. You're left with: [ frac{2M}{3} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3^2} + frac{1}{3^3} + cdots ] 10. Note that the right-hand side is a geometric series with first term (frac{1}{3}) and common ratio (frac{1}{3}): [ frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3^2} + frac{1}{3^3} + cdots = frac{frac{1}{3}}{1 - frac{1}{3}} = frac{frac{1}{3}}{frac{2}{3}} = frac{1}{2} ] 11. Hence, [ frac{2M}{3} = frac{1}{2} ] 12. Solve for (M): [ 2M = frac{3}{2} quad Rightarrow quad M = frac{3}{4} ] 13. Substitute back to original expression for (N): [ N = 3^M = 3^{frac{3}{4}} ] 14.

Let ( e ) denote the number of edges of these smaller triangles that lie entirely within the original triangle (not including the edges of the original triangle itself). 2. **Counting the Total Edges:** Each smaller triangle has 3 sides. Therefore, if there are ( n ) smaller triangles, the total number of sides (or edges) across all small triangles is ( 3n ). 3. **External Edges:** Out of these ( 3n ) edges, 3 of them will be sides of the original large triangle. These three edges of the original triangle are counted only once in the collection of sides. 4. **Internal Edges:** The remaining ( 3n - 3 ) edges are internal edges (edges lying within the interior of the original triangle). 5. **Double Counting of Internal Edges:** Each internal edge is shared by two adjacent small triangles, so each internal edge is counted twice in the total count of the ( 3n - 3 ) edges. Therefore, the actual count of the unique internal edges is: [ e = frac{3n - 3}{2} ] 6. **Ensuring ( e ) is an Integer:** Since ( e ) represents the number of internal edges and must be an integer, the expression ( frac{3n - 3}{2} ) must result in an integer.

Therefore, substituting the center's coordinates into the line's equation yields: [ -a/2 + 1 - 1 = 0. ] This simplifies to: [ -a/2 = 0, ] which implies (a = 0). Consequently, the center of circle (C) has coordinates (C(0, 1)). Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{A}.

Therefore, option A is incorrect. For option B, since A, B, and C are the acute angles of an acute triangle triangle ABC, we have A + B > frac{pi}{2}, which implies A > frac{pi}{2} - B. Noting that both sides of the inequality are acute angles, we take the sine and get sin A > sin(frac{pi}{2} - B) = cos B. Since f(x) is decreasing on (0, 1), from sin A > cos B, we can infer that f(sin A) < f(cos B), so option B is incorrect. For option C, because A, B, and C are acute angles of triangle ABC, we have B + C > frac{pi}{2}, so C - frac{pi}{2} > -B. Taking the cosine on both sides of this inequality with acute angles gives cos (C - frac{pi}{2}) > cos(-B), which means sin C > cos B (since cos(frac{pi}{2}-C)=sin C).

To find the sum of the first n terms of the sequence left{ frac{{{a}_{n}}}{n+1} right}, we need to find the equation of the tangent line at the point (1,1).

Let ( n = gcd(4a^2 - 1, 4ab - 1) ). Then, [ n = gcd(4a^2 - 4ab, 4ab - 1) = gcd(4a(a - b), 4ab - 1). ] Since ( 4a ) and ( 4ab - 1 ) are coprime, we have [ n = gcd(a - b, 4ab - 1). ] Thus, (frac{(4a^2 - 1)^2}{4ab - 1}) being an integer implies that (frac{(a - b)^2}{4ab - 1}) is an integer, say ( k ). Expanding, we get [ a^2 - a(4bk + 2b) + (b^2 + k) = 0. ] Assume ( a neq b ) and let ( a > b ). Suppose ((a, b)) is a solution with ( a + b ) minimal. The equation is symmetric in ( a ) and ( b ), so ((b, a)) is also a solution. By Vieta's theorem, the other solution to the quadratic in ( a ) is (frac{b^2 + k}{a}). Thus, ((frac{b^2 + k}{a}, b)) is a solution, and therefore ((b, frac{b^2 + k}{a})) is a solution. Since ( b < a ), we must have (frac{b^2 + k}{a} geq b), otherwise ( b + frac{b^2 + k}{a} < a + b ), contradicting the minimality of ( a + b ). Hence, [ k geq b(a - b). ] This implies [ frac{(a - b)^2}{4ab - 1} geq b(a - b), ] meaning [ a - b geq 4ab^2 - b, ] so [ a(4b^2 - 1) leq 0, ] which is a contradiction for positive integers ( a ) and ( b ). Thus, our assumption was false and ( a = b ). 2. **Main Problem:** - For ( k ) even, let ( k = 2x ). Then, [ frac{(4k^2 - 1)^2}{8kn - 1} = frac{(4k^2 - 1)^2}{4k^2 - 1}, ] which is clearly an integer. Therefore, ( 8kn - 1 ) is a positive divisor of ((4k^2 - 1)^2), proving the statement for even ( k ). - For ( k ) odd, assume there exists a factor of ((4k^2 - 1)^2) in the form of ( 8kn - 1 ). Then, [ frac{(4k^2 - 1)^2}{4k(2n) - 1} ] must be an integer. By the lemma, this is an integer if and only if ( k = 2n ), which means ( k ) is even, leading to a contradiction.

This can be written as: L + 10 = 0.75E (2) The combined weight of Leo, Kendra, and Ethan is given as 210 pounds: L + K + E = 210 (3) We have three equations and three unknowns. We can solve these equations to find the value of L, K, and E. First, let's express K and E in terms of L using equations (1) and (2): From equation (1): 1.5K = L + 10 K = (L + 10) / 1.5 (4) From equation (2): 0.75E = L + 10 E = (L + 10) / 0.75 (5) Now, we can substitute equations (4) and (5) into equation (3): L + (L + 10) / 1.5 + (L + 10) / 0.75 = 210 To simplify the calculation, let's find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 1.5 * 0.75 = 1.125.

So, the total number of pairs in the 45 times 45 grid is: [ 45 times 44 + 45 times 44 = 2 times 45 times 44 = 3960 ] Removing the points (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) affects the count of pairs: - Removing (1,1) removes 2 pairs: (1,1)-(1,2) and (1,1)-(2,1). - Removing (1,2) removes 2 pairs: (1,2)-(1,3) and (1,2)-(2,2). - Removing (1,3) removes 2 pairs: (1,3)-(1,4) and (1,3)-(2,3). However, note that (1,2)-(1,3) is counted twice, so we subtract it only once. Therefore, the total number of pairs removed is: [ 2 + 2 + 2 - 1 = 5 ] Thus, the total number of pairs remaining is: [ 3960 - 6 = 3954 ] 3. **Proving the Bound:** Let A be the set of 2022 points. Let a be the number of distinct x-coordinates and b be the number of distinct y-coordinates. The maximum number of pairs is given by: [ 4 times 2022 - (lvert S_L rvert + lvert S_R rvert + lvert S_T rvert + lvert S_B rvert) ] where S_L, S_R, S_T, S_B are the sets of points that are the leftmost, rightmost, topmost, and bottommost of A respectively. Since lvert S_L rvert = lvert S_R rvert and lvert S_T rvert = lvert S_B rvert, the maximum number of pairs is: [ 4044 - (lvert S_L rvert + lvert S_T rvert) ] We need to show that a + b = lvert S_L rvert + lvert S_T rvert geq 90. Suppose a + b leq 89. Then: [ 2022 leq ab leq 44 times 45 = 1980 ] This is a contradiction, so a + b geq 90. Therefore, the maximum number of pairs is: [ 4044 - 90 = 3954 ] The final answer is boxed{3954}"},{"prompt":"Let x and y be positive numbers such that frac{1}{x+1} + frac{1}{y+1} = frac{1}{2}.

The sum of the binomial coefficients in any expansion (a+b)^n is given by 2^n. This is because when x=1 in the binomial theorem, we get (1+1)^n = 2^n. The sum of the coefficients in the given expansion, when x=1, becomes (sqrt[3]{1}-frac{2}{sqrt{1}})^n = (1-2)^n = (-1)^n. The difference between these two sums is given as 255, so we set up the equation: [2^n - (-1)^n = 255] Since (-1)^n can either be 1 or -1, and we are looking for a positive difference, we consider (-1)^n = -1 (which happens for even n), thus: [2^n - (-1) = 255] [2^n + 1 = 255] [2^n = 254] Upon inspection, 2^8 = 256, so our equation slightly adjusts to: [2^n - 1 = 255] [2^n = 256] Therefore, n = 8. boxed{n = 8} Part 2: Finding the Term with the Largest Coefficient Given n=8, the general term in the expansion of ({sqrt[3]{x}-frac{2}{{sqrt{x}}}})^8 is: [T_{r+1} = C_{8}^{r} cdot (-2)^r cdot x^{frac{16-5r}{6}}] To maximize the coefficient C_{8}^{r} cdot (-2)^r, we note that r should be an even number to maximize (-2)^r. The possible values of r are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. After evaluating the coefficients for these values of r, we find that when r=6, the coefficient C_{8}^{6} cdot (-2)^6 is maximized. Specifically, the coefficient is: [C_{8}^{6} cdot (-2)^6 = 28 cdot 64 = 1792] Therefore, the term with the largest coefficient in the expansion is when r=6, which gives us: [T_{7} = 1792 cdot x^{frac{16-5(6)}{6}} = 1792 cdot x^{frac{7}{3}}] boxed{T_{7} = 1792 cdot x^{frac{7}{3}}}"},{"prompt":"On their school trip, Lisa has taken some photos, and Robert has taken the same number of photos as Lisa.

As they proceed, if at any point it is indicated that they are moving away from the whistle, they stop and mark the current position as Q and the last position as P. - The referee then returns from Q to P and takes a step perpendicular to the AC line. 3. **Orthogonal Directions**: - After stepping perpendicular, if getting closer to the whistle, they continue along this new line until they see the whistle. - If they are not closer, they go the opposite direction on the perpendicular line of AC until they see the whistle. 4. **Algorithm Analysis**: - If the whistle is found while moving along AC, they will have taken at most ⌊d + 1⌋ steps, where d is the distance from the starting point. - If the initial perpendicular movement suggests the referee was further, the process involves calculating the possible regions where the whistle might be, narrowing the search area by checking perpendicular directions from those points. 5. **Region of Interest**: - Suppose P and Q are close, the regions formed by the perpendicular bisectors give the possible bands where the whistle lies.

The height h is the sum of the radius R and the half of the edge length a (since the center of the face to the cube's surface is frac{a}{2}): [h = R + frac{a}{2} = sqrt{3} + 1] The area S of the base ABCD (which is a square with side length 2) is: [S = a^2 = 2^2 = 4] The formula for the volume of a tetrahedron is: [V = frac{1}{3}Sh] Substituting the values of S and h into the formula, we get: [V = frac{1}{3} times 4 times (sqrt{3} + 1) = frac{4(1+sqrt{3})}{3}] Therefore, the maximum volume of the tetrahedron P-ABCD is boxed{frac{{4(1+sqrt{3})}}{3}}, which corresponds to choice: boxed{B}."},{"prompt":"A man has some hens and cows.

If there are 4 brown stripes, how many blue stripes does Vaishali's Saree have? Additionally, the total number of stripes on the Saree, including the blue, brown, and gold stripes, is exactly 100. Finally, the Saree has a specific pattern for the stripes, alternating between gold, blue, and brown in that order. How many times does this pattern appear throughout the length of the Saree?","completion":"First, let's find out the number of gold and blue stripes based on the given information. If there are 4 brown stripes and there are three times as many gold stripes as brown stripes, then there are: 3 * 4 = 12 gold stripes. Next, since there are five times as many blue stripes as gold stripes, there are: 5 * 12 = 60 blue stripes. Now, let's verify the total number of stripes: Blue stripes + Gold stripes + Brown stripes = Total stripes 60 + 12 + 4 = 76 stripes. However, we are told that the total number of stripes is exactly 100, which does not match our calculation. It seems there might be a mistake in the calculation or the given information. Let's re-evaluate the information given. If we assume the total number of stripes is indeed 100, and we have the correct number of brown and gold stripes, we need to find the correct number of blue stripes that would make the total 100. Let's denote the number of blue stripes as B, gold stripes as G, and brown stripes as Br. We have: G = 3 * Br B = 5 * G We know that Br = 4 and G = 3 * 4 = 12. Now, let's find B using the total number of stripes: B + G + Br = 100 B + 12 + 4 = 100 B + 16 = 100 B = 100 - 16 B = 84 blue stripes. Now, let's find out how many times the pattern of gold, blue, and brown stripes appears. Since the pattern is gold, blue, brown, each complete pattern consists of 1 gold stripe, 1 blue stripe, and 1 brown stripe, which is a total of 3 stripes per pattern. The total number of patterns, P, can be found by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of stripes in one pattern: P = Total stripes / Stripes per pattern P = 100 / 3 Since we cannot have a fraction of a pattern, we'll take the integer part of the division: P = 33 with 1 stripe remaining (since 100 is not perfectly divisible by 3). Therefore, the pattern appears boxed{33} times throughout the length of the Saree, with one extra stripe that does not complete the last pattern."},{"prompt":"Given that the random variable X follows a normal distribution N(0,sigma^{2}), and P(2leqslant Xleqslant 0)=0.4, then P(X > 2)= ______.","completion":"Since the random variable X follows a normal distribution N(0,sigma^{2}), and P(-2leqslant Xleqslant 0)=0.4, it follows that P(0leqslant Xleqslant 2)=0.4 Therefore, P(X > 2)=0.5-0.4=0.1 Hence, the answer is boxed{0.1}.

Gavrila then repeats this operation for the boxes that are still empty, again filling some empty boxes with 7 smaller boxes, and leaving some empty. Step 2: Determining the Effect of Each Operation Each time a box is filled with 7 smaller boxes: - The number of non-empty boxes increases by 1 because one previously empty box gets filled. - The number of empty boxes increases by 6 because each filled box now contains 7 smaller boxes, all of which start out empty (7 new empty boxes - 1 previously empty box turned non-empty).

When A works alone for x days, A completes x/18 of the work. When B works alone for 6 days, B completes 6/9 (which simplifies to 2/3) of the work.

Part 2: Most Likely Number of Handicrafts Out of 10 That Cannot Be Exported # ① Finding the Probability of a Handicraft Being Rated as Grade D A grade D rating occurs if 2 or all 3 experts consider the quality unsatisfactory. The probability for this is calculated as follows: C_{3}^{2} times left(frac{1}{3}right)^{2} times left(1-frac{1}{3}right) + C_{3}^{3} times left(frac{1}{3}right)^{3} = 3 times left(frac{1}{3}right)^{2} times frac{2}{3} + left(frac{1}{3}right)^{3} = frac{7}{27} Let xi represent the number of handicrafts out of 10 that cannot be exported. The distribution of xi follows a binomial distribution B(10, frac{7}{27}). The probability of xi=k is given by: P(xi=k) = C_{10}^{k} times left(frac{7}{27}right)^{k} times left(frac{20}{27}right)^{10-k} To find the most likely number of handicrafts that cannot be exported, we examine the ratio frac{P(xi=k+1)}{P(xi=k)}: frac{P(xi=k+1)}{P(xi=k)} = frac{C_{10}^{k+1} times left(frac{7}{27}right)^{k+1} times left(frac{20}{27}right)^{9-k}}{C_{10}^{k} times left(frac{7}{27}right)^{k} times left(frac{20}{27}right)^{10-k}} = frac{70-7k}{20k+20} From frac{70-7k}{20k+20} > 1, we find k < frac{50}{27}. This implies that for k leq 1, P(xi=k+1) > P(xi=k). Conversely, from frac{70-7k}{20k+20} < 1, we find k > frac{50}{27}, indicating that for k geq 2, P(xi=k+1) < P(xi=k). Therefore, the most likely number of handicrafts out of 10 that cannot be exported is boxed{2}. # ② Distribution and Mean of X The probabilities of a handicraft being rated as grades A, B, C, and D are frac{8}{27}, frac{16}{81}, frac{20}{81}, and frac{7}{27}, respectively. The profits associated with these grades are 900 yuan, 600 yuan, 300 yuan, and 100 yuan, respectively. The expected profit, E(X), is calculated as: E(X) = 900 times frac{8}{27} + 600 times frac{16}{81} + 300 times frac{20}{81} + 100 times frac{7}{27} = frac{13100}{27} Therefore, the mean profit per handicraft is boxed{frac{13100}{27}} yuan."},{"prompt":"A 70 cm long wire is cut into two pieces so that one piece is 2/5th of the other.

The icosahedron has 20 equilateral triangular faces. 2. **Step 2: Perpendiculars from the Center** From the center of the sphere, drop perpendiculars to the center of each face of the icosahedron. Because the faces are equilateral triangles, these perpendiculars will intersect the faces at their centroids. 3. **Step 3: Construction of Congruent Triangles** Connect the points where these perpendiculars intersect the faces of the icosahedron with the vertices of the corresponding face. This will divide each equilateral triangle face into 3 congruent smaller triangles. These smaller triangles are isosceles triangles. 4. **Step 4: Projection onto the Sphere** Now, project these isosceles triangles from the center of the sphere onto the surface of the sphere. This projection results in 60 congruent spherical triangles on the surface of the sphere. 5. **Step 5: Properties of the Spherical Triangles** Each of these 60 spherical triangles will have vertices that are the projection of the centroids and the vertices of the equilateral triangles of the icosahedron. The sides of these spherical triangles are arcs of great circles. 6. **Conclusion** The 60 congruent spherical triangles are exactly the pieces we are seeking. Each spherical triangle is less than a quarter of the circumference of the great circle since they are derived from dividing equilateral triangles, and projecting these divisions keeps proportionality intact on the sphere's surface.

We aim to prove that the length of any segment inside the polyhedron does not exceed the length of the greatest segment between two vertices of the polyhedron. 2. **Useful Planimetric Statement**: We start by using the following geometric assertion: Given a triangle ( triangle ABC ), if point ( X ) lies on the side ( BC ), then either ( AB geq AX ) or ( AC geq AX ). 3. **Fundamental Concept**: For point ( X ) lying on ( BC ): - Either ( angle BXA geq 90^circ ) or ( angle CAX geq 90^circ ). - If ( angle BXA geq 90^circ ), then ( AB geq AX ). - If ( angle CAX geq 90^circ ), then ( AC geq AX ). 4. **Extension of the Segment**: Let’s extend the given internal segment to intersect the faces of the polyhedron at points ( P ) and ( Q ). By extending, the length of the segment can only increase. 5. **Intermediate Analysis**: Let ( MN ) be any segment with endpoints on the edges of the polyhedron intersecting at ( P ): - We know that either ( MQ geq PQ ) or ( NQ geq PQ ). 6. **Vertex Segment Replacement**: For the given condition, assume without loss of generality that ( MQ geq PQ ). Points ( M ) and ( Q ) lie on different edges, say ( AB ): - Either ( AQ geq MQ ) or ( BQ geq MQ ). 7. **Finding a Greater Segment**: By iterative substitution: - Replace ( PQ ) with a greater segment, one of whose endpoints lies on a vertex of the polyhedron. - Apply similar reasoning for subsequent segments until segment endpoints are vertices of the polyhedron. 8. **Conclusion**: Through the iterative replacement and comparison steps, we eventually replace the initial segment with a segment whose endpoints are vertices of the polyhedron. This maximal segment is necessarily between two vertices of the polyhedron, proving the statement.

These fresh grapes will be dried, resulting in three different batches of dried grapes with varying percentages of water content. Dried grapes of Batch A will have 20%, Batch B will have 25%, and Batch C will have 30% water content by weight. What is the total combined weight of the three batches of dried grapes after the drying process?","completion":"To find the total combined weight of the three batches of dried grapes after the drying process, we need to calculate the weight of the non-water content (solid content) in each batch of fresh grapes and then determine what that weight would be when the water content is reduced to the specified percentages in the dried grapes. Let's start with Batch A: Batch A has 70% water, so it has 30% solid content. The weight of the solid content in Batch A is 30% of 100 kg = 0.30 * 100 kg = 30 kg. When dried, Batch A will have 20% water content, which means it will have 80% solid content. Since the solid content doesn't change, the dried weight of Batch A will be: Let the dried weight of Batch A be ( x ) kg, then ( 0.80 * x = 30 kg ) ( x = 30 kg / 0.80 ) ( x = 37.5 kg ) Now, let's calculate for Batch B: Batch B has 75% water, so it has 25% solid content. The weight of the solid content in Batch B is 25% of 150 kg = 0.25 * 150 kg = 37.5 kg. When dried, Batch B will have 25% water content, which means it will have 75% solid content. The dried weight of Batch B will be: Let the dried weight of Batch B be ( y ) kg, then ( 0.75 * y = 37.5 kg ) ( y = 37.5 kg / 0.75 ) ( y = 50 kg ) Finally, let's calculate for Batch C: Batch C has 80% water, so it has 20% solid content. The weight of the solid content in Batch C is 20% of 200 kg = 0.20 * 200 kg = 40 kg. When dried, Batch C will have 30% water content, which means it will have 70% solid content. The dried weight of Batch C will be: Let the dried weight of Batch C be ( z ) kg, then ( 0.70 * z = 40 kg ) ( z = 40 kg / 0.70 ) ( z = 57.14 kg ) Now, we add the weights of the dried grapes from all three batches to get the total combined weight: Total dried weight = ( 37.5 kg + 50 kg + 57.14 kg ) Total dried weight = ( 144.64 kg ) Therefore, the total combined weight of the three batches of dried grapes after the drying process is ( boxed{144.64} kg )."},{"prompt":"An organization has a board consisting of one president, two vicepresidents (VP1 and VP2), and each vicepresident supervises 3 department heads.

The set of residues coprime to 30 is: [ 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29 ] We need to determine how many numbers in any sequence of 13 consecutive numbers (taken modulo 30) belong to this set. By inspection, any sequence of 13 residues must include at least 2 numbers from the set ( {1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29} ).

Since we have exactly two teachers standing next to each other, we have one pair of teachers (which we'll treat as a single unit) and one individual teacher. 1. Consider the pair of teachers as a single unit. Now we have five units to arrange: four students (S1, S2, S3, S4) and the pair of teachers (T12). There are 5! ways to arrange these five units in a row. 2. However, within the unit of the pair of teachers, there are 2! ways to arrange the two teachers (as Teacher 1 could be first or Teacher 2 could be first). 3. Now we need to place the remaining individual teacher (T3) into the arrangement. T3 can't be next to the T12 unit, so there are only four possible spots: at the beginning, between S1 and S2, between S2 and S3, or between S3 and S4, or at the end. 4. Therefore, for each arrangement of the five units, there are 4 choices of where to place T3. Thus, we multiply the number of arrangements of the five units by 4. 5. Combining all these factors, the total number of arrangements is given by: 5! cdot 2! cdot 4 = 120 cdot 2 cdot 4 = 960.

If they each purchase pizza alone with 30: - They can buy 3 small pizzas each (10 each), which would be 3 * 36 square inches = 108 square inches per person, or 216 square inches total for both. - They can buy 1 large pizza each (20 each), which would be 1 * 81 square inches = 81 square inches per person, or 162 square inches total for both.

Two players take turns covering the floor with mats, where each mat covers two adjacent tiles. The first player places one mat per move, while the second player places three mats per move. A tile cannot be covered by more than five mats at any given point. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. 2. **Strategy for the Second Player:** The key to solving this problem is to devise a strategy for the second player that ensures they can always make a move. Let's consider that the second player (Player 2) mentally divides the hall into 2 times 2 blocks. Let's call those blocks \\"units.\\" Given the initial setup: - The sports hall has dimensions 100 times 100, leading us to 50 times 50 blocks (each block being 2 times 2), giving a total of 2500 blocks. 3. **Second Player's Move:** Each time Player 1 makes a move, Player 2 must respond in a way that retains balance. Specifically, Player 2 will ensure covering cells in such a way that after their turn, the number of mats used in each block remains balanced (i.e., all cells in each block remain covered the same number of times). 4. **Inductive Step:** We now show that Player 2 will always have the opportunity to place mats: - **Case 1:** If Player 1 places their mat across two blocks, Player 2 will place mats such that the remaining cells of those two blocks are fully covered and all cells in each block are covered equivalently. - **Case 2:** If Player 1 places their mat within a single block, Player 2 places one mat within the same block, ensuring that all four cells within the block are covered uniformly. The remaining two mats are placed on any two other cells in blocks that still have less than five coverage. 5. **Finding Covered Blocks:** To prove the existence of a block covered in less than five layers: - Assume there is no block covered in less than five layers. This means all 2500 blocks are covered by exactly five mats. The total number of mats placed is 5 times 2500 = 12500 mats. - Notice that if a block has cells covered exactly five times, after the first player's turn (an act covering two cells), the remaining coverage is divided among the other player's subsequent moves in multiple layers. 6. **Contradiction:** Given that each turn involves the placement of 4 new mat pairs per round (4 pairs per one initial mat): - Hence, the total number of mats follows: [ text{Mats used} = 12504 = 4k text{ for every complete cycle} + 2 ] - Given pairs come in multiples of 4 but total number mismatches leads to contradiction for exact 2 surplus. All blocks must have a 'less than' mark requirement. 7. **Conclusion:** Player 2 can always place the mats without violating the constraints of the problem: One block covered equivalently multiple times while maintaining balance.

Will Vasya always be able to do this?","completion":"To determine if it is always possible to arrange the six edges of a tetrahedron into two triangles such that each edge is a side of exactly one triangle, we will analyze the properties of the tetrahedron's edges and apply relevant geometric inequalities. 1. **Understanding the Tetrahedron:** - Consider a tetrahedron DABC with six edges: DA, DB, DC, AB, BC, and AC. - The goal is to check if it is always possible to form two separate triangles using these edges such that no edge is repeated in the two triangles. 2. **Evaluating Possible Triangles:** - Assume initially that one of the longest edges is AB, without loss of generality. - Check if it's possible to form a triangle using edges emanating from A or B. This would mean forming a triangle using three edges connected to a same vertex. 3. **Necessary Conditions:** - For vertex A, the edges are DA, AC, and AB. - For vertex B, the edges are DB, BC, and AB. - To form a valid triangle at a vertex, the side lengths must satisfy the triangle inequality, i.e., the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. 4. **Applying the Triangle Inequalities:** - Assume Vasya cannot form a triangle with the edges emanating from vertex A and vertex B. - This means: [ AB geq AC + AD quad text{(no triangle can be formed at A)} ] [ AB geq BC + BD quad text{(no triangle can be formed at B)} ] 5. **Summation of Inequalities:** - Adding the two inequalities above: [ 2AB geq AC + AD + BC + BD ] 6. **Checking for Logical Consistency:** - However, from the triangle inequalities for the faces ABD and ABC: [ AB < AD + BD ] [ AB < AC + BC ] - Adding these inequalities yields: [ 2AB < AD + BD + AC + BC ] - This creates a contradiction. The total sum of the lengths of the edges connected implies 2AB < AC + AD + BC + BD. 7. **Conclusion:** - The contradiction indicates that it is not possible for both conditions to be true simultaneously. Therefore, it is always possible for Vasya to form two distinct triangles using the edges of the tetrahedron. Any edge not used in one triangle will naturally form part of the other triangle by default. Thus, Vasya can indeed always manage to create two triangles such that each edge of the tetrahedron is the side of exactly one of the triangles.

To do this, we need to determine the smallest possible value of (max {|a+b|, |a-b|, |2006-b|}). 1. **Introduce Variable for Maximum:** Let ( M = max {|a+b|, |a-b|, |2006-b|} ). By the definition of the maximum function, we have: [ M geq |a+b|, quad M geq |a-b|, quad M geq |2006-b| ] 2. **Combine Inequalities:** Adding the inequalities ( M geq |a+b| ) and ( M geq |a-b| ), we get: [ M + M geq |a+b| + |a-b| ] This can be simplified to: [ 2M geq |a+b| + |a-b| ] 3. **Add Inequality for Third Term:** Now, consider the inequality ( M geq |2006-b| ).

This includes ordinary points as well as points at infinity. - Let ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) be any two points in the projective plane. - According to the axiom of projective geometry, there exists exactly one line ( l ) that passes through both ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ). 2. **Conclusion for Part (a):** - Therefore, we can conclude that through any two points, whether they be ordinary points or points at infinity, there passes a unique line. - This directly follows from the axioms of projective geometry.

We will calculate the two probabilities and establish the relation between them to determine the parity of m. Let's calculate the probabilities: The total number of ways to draw two balls from m+n balls is binom{m+n}{2}. The number of ways to draw two red balls is binom{m}{2}. Therefore, P_{text{red-red}} = frac{binom{m}{2}}{binom{m+n}{2}}. The number of ways to draw one red and one white ball is mn. So, P_{text{red-white}} = frac{mn}{binom{m+n}{2}}. Since P_{text{red-red}} equals k times P_{text{red-white}}, we have frac{binom{m}{2}}{binom{m+n}{2}} = k cdot frac{mn}{binom{m+n}{2}}. Canceling binom{m+n}{2} from both sides and simplifying results in frac{m(m-1)}{2} = k cdot mn Rightarrow m(m-1) = 2kmn. Since m-1 is even, m must be odd to ensure that the left side of the equation remains even (because the product of an even and an odd number is even). Thus, m is an odd number.

We already have P_{text{red-white}} from part (1): P_{text{red-white}} = frac{mn}{binom{m+n}{2}}. Setting P_{text{same color}} equal to P_{text{red-white}}, we have frac{binom{m}{2} + binom{n}{2}}{binom{m+n}{2}} = frac{mn}{binom{m+n}{2}}. After canceling binom{m+n}{2} and simplifying, we obtain binom{m}{2} + binom{n}{2} = mn Rightarrow frac{m(m-1)}{2} + frac{n(n-1)}{2} = mn. Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fractions, we get m^2 - m + n^2 - n = 2mn. Rearrange the terms to form a quadratic equation: m^2 - m + n^2 - n - 2mn = 0. Given that m + n leq 40, we now need to find all possible integer pairs (m, n) that satisfy both the equation and the condition. To find the solutions, we must list out the pairs (m, n) within the range of the condition and check for which of them the above equation holds true.

Consider the sequence defined by: [ x_n = 6x_{n-1} - 4x_{n-2} ] for all ( n ge 2 ) with initial conditions ( x_0 = 2 ) and ( x_1 = 6 ). 2. We observe that each ( x_n ) is an even integer. This can be shown by induction: - Base case: ( x_0 = 2 ) and ( x_1 = 6 ) are both even. - Inductive step: Assume ( x_{n-1} ) and ( x_{n-2} ) are even. Then, [ x_n = 6x_{n-1} - 4x_{n-2} ] Since ( x_{n-1} ) and ( x_{n-2} ) are even, ( 6x_{n-1} ) and ( 4x_{n-2} ) are also even, and the difference of two even numbers is even. Hence, ( x_n ) is even. 3. Note that this sequence can be expressed as: [ x_n = (3 + sqrt{5})^n + (3 - sqrt{5})^n ] This follows from solving the characteristic equation of the recurrence relation. 4. We deduce that: [ (3 + sqrt{5})^n + (3 - sqrt{5})^n ] is an even integer, as ( x_n ) is even for all ( n ). 5. Also, observe that ( 0 < (3 - sqrt{5})^n < 1 ) for all positive integers ( n ). This is because ( 3 - sqrt{5} ) is approximately 0.76393, which is less than 1, and raising a number less than 1 to a positive integer power results in a number between 0 and 1. 6. Therefore, if: [ (3 + sqrt{5})^n + (3 - sqrt{5})^n = 2m ] for some natural number ( m ), then: [ (3 + sqrt{5})^n = 2m - (3 - sqrt{5})^n ] 7. Since ( 0 < (3 - sqrt{5})^n < 1 ), we have: [ 2m - 1 < (3 + sqrt{5})^n < 2m ] 8. The integral part of ( (3 + sqrt{5})^n ) is thus ( 2m - 1 ), which is an odd number.

So, 65% of his original salary S is equal to the salary he has after the increase.

Let's call the percentage increase P%. The increased salary would be the decreased salary plus the increase, which we can express as: Increased salary = Decreased salary + (P% of Decreased salary) Increased salary = 0.5S + (P/100 * 0.5S) We know that the increased salary is equal to 0.65S, so we can set the two expressions equal to each other: 0.65S = 0.5S + (P/100 * 0.5S) Now, we can solve for P: 0.65S = 0.5S + (0.5P/100 * S) 0.65S = 0.5S + (0.005P * S) Subtract 0.5S from both sides: 0.65S - 0.5S = 0.005P * S 0.15S = 0.005P * S Divide both sides by S: 0.15 = 0.005P Now, divide both sides by 0.005 to solve for P: P = 0.15 / 0.005 P = 30 So, the percentage increase in Kamal's salary after the decrease was boxed{30%} ."},{"prompt":"A triangle has a side of length 10 cm, a side of length 24 cm, and a right angle.

Each of these shorter paths is half the length of the longer paths. 2. **Movement Strategy**: - Initially, let Petya move to vertex B and Vasya move to vertex C. - Since the monkey runs three times faster than the guards, by the time Petya and Vasya reach B and C respectively, the monkey couldn’t have traversed the longer distances AB or AC. 3. **Monkey’s Possible Locations**: - If the monkey is on path BC, the chase straightforwardly implies the monkey is caught since it’s flanked from both sides while being slower along any direct path. - We can assume without loss of generality that the monkey is not on BC. 4. **Monitoring the Paths**: - Let’s now assume the monkey is in the right half of the zoo’s paths, i.e., next to sides CE or CF. - Define control by Vasya over vertex C.

Wilson's Theorem states that (p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p} for a prime p, which implies that (p-1)! is not divisible by p. 5. **Identifying Exceptions**: The condition n^2 mid n! fails when n is a prime or n=4. This is because: - For n=4, 4^2 = 16 does not divide 4! = 24. - For a prime p, p^2 does not divide p! because there is only one factor of p in p!. 6. **Counting Primes and Exceptions**: There are 15 primes between 1 and 50.

Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) * 100 Let's assume the cost price for 1000 grams is 100 (for simplicity). The cost price for 666.67 grams would then be (666.67/1000) * 100 = 66.67.

Given that one large and four small packets of cat food last for two weeks (14 days): Let L be the amount of food in a large packet, and S be the amount of food in a small packet. Therefore, one large packet and four small packets should cover a period of (14) days: [ L + 4S = 14 text{ days} ] 2. Determine if one large packet and three small packets will cover (11) days: We need to check the validity of the claim that one large and three small packets won't last (11) days. Assume to the contrary that they do not suffice. 3. Use the previous finding to calculate the hypothetical duration covered by one small packet: According to the given information, one large and three small packets must cover less than (11) days: [ L + 3S < 11 text{ days} ] 4. Substitute the value from step 1 into the inequality from step 3: Realize that substituting (L + 4S = 14 text{ days}) into another equation helps clarify the relationship between two packet setups. Subtract the two setups to isolate the term with (S): Subtract ( (L + 3S < 11) ): [ (L + 4S) - (L + 3S) = 14 text{ days} - 11 text{ days} ] Simplifies to: [ S < 3 text{ days} ] This calculation illustrates that each small packet must individually cater to less than (3) days. 5. Validate sufficiency of packet amounts: Substitute ( L + 3S ) into our original inequality from step 4: If each small packet caters (S geq 3) days, then the four-packet arrangement covering more days is invalid since the arrangement with three or fewer packets yields insufficient days. Therefore, the true balance must cover our proposed duration. 6. Thus, reconsider the opposite scenario of providing adequate packets, confirming if packets indeed last prescribed periods: [ L + 3S > 11 text{ days} ] Conclusion. One large and three small packets will indeed cover (11) days. [ boxed{Yes} ]"},{"prompt":"Suppose there are 4n line segments of unit length inside a circle of radius n .

According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information: 1. The building time is three times the planning time minus 5 minutes, which gives us the equation b = 3p - 5. 2. The total time spent on the diorama, which is the sum of the building time and planning time, is 67 minutes. This gives us another equation, b + p = 67. We can solve this system of equations step by step: First, substitute the expression for b from the first equation into the second equation: [3p - 5 + p = 67] Combine like terms (3p and p): [4p - 5 = 67] To isolate the term with p, add 5 to both sides of the equation: [4p - 5 + 5 = 67 + 5] [4p = 72] Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for p: [4p / 4 = 72 / 4] [p = 18] Having found the planning time (p = 18 minutes), we can now find the building time (b) by substituting p back into the first equation: [b = 3p - 5 = 3(18) - 5] [b = 54 - 5] [b = 49] Therefore, Annie spent boxed{49} minutes building the diorama."},{"prompt":"A certain bus driver is paid a regular rate of 16 per hour for any number of hours that does not exceed 40 hours per week.

The retailer buys 60 pens at the price of 36 pens, so he pays 36 for 60 pens. The cost price for the retailer is therefore 36. The retailer makes a 65% profit on his cost price. So, the profit is 65% of 36, which is 0.65 * 36 = 23.40. The selling price (SP) is therefore the cost price (CP) plus the profit, which is 36 + 23.40 = 59.40. Now, since the retailer has 60 pens, the selling price per pen without any discount would be 59.40 / 60 pens = 0.99 per pen. Since we assumed the market price of each pen is 1, the discount given per pen is 1 - 0.99 = 0.01. The discount percentage is then (0.01 / 1) * 100% = 1%.

The discriminant Delta of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. For our equation, a = m-1, b = -2m, and c = m-2.

The task is to identify the values of a and b such that there are exactly 35 unattainable scores in total. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - Points for heads = a. - Points for tails = b. - Both a and b are positive integers with a > b. - Total unattainable scores = 35. 2. **Condition for Unattainable Scores:** - We need to prove that (a, b) = 1 (i.e., a and b are coprime). - Assume (a, b) = d > 1. This would mean all possible scores would be divisible by d, leading to an infinite number of unattainable scores such as those that are not multiples of d, contradicting the given condition that only 35 unattainable scores exist. - Thus, (a, b) = 1. 3. **Counting Lattice Points:** - If m is an attainable score, the line ax + by = m must pass through at least one integer point (x, y) inside the positive quadrant (the first quadrant). 4. **Using the Euclidean Algorithm:** - For (a, b) = 1, the numbers b cdot 0, b cdot 1, dots, b cdot (a-1) taken modulo a are distinct. This implies there is a residue modulo a for every integer 0, 1, dots, a-1. - For m geq ab, there exists some 0 leq k leq a-1 such that m - bk is divisible by a, making m attainable.

Since the fraction has a denominator of 5, we can multiply the whole number x by 5/5 to get a common denominator: (5/5)x - (3/5)x = 50 Now, combine like terms: (5/5 - 3/5)x = 50 (2/5)x = 50 To solve for x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by (2/5): x = 50 / (2/5) To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal.

The following diagram demonstrates how this can be achieved using two squares of dimensions 4 times 4 and one square of dimensions 6 times 6: ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_73d18a44a5da32c0ad55g-08.jpg?height=221&width=457&top_left_y=1506&top_left_x=869) The large square (6 times 6) covers three faces: the front, the bottom, and the back. Each of the smaller squares (4 times 4) covers part of the top face and one of the side faces. **Explanation and Drawing Considerations:** 1. **Construct Fold Lines**: - Draw the net of the parallelepiped so that each square is adjacent to two others. - This configuration ensures that all squares share edges with their neighboring squares. 2. **Dimension Analysis**: - Let's illustrate a larger square covering three faces and two smaller squares covering the remaining parts. - Dividing the dimensions appropriately: Assume the bottom square's side is 2x. 3. **Labeling and Calculations**: - For the net of the parallelepiped: - Let one edge of the cut line to the adjoining top face be x, and designate the other segment as y. - We need the sum of the side lengths to obey the properties of a folded 3D parallelepiped. - The boundary conditions are satisfied if: [ y+(x+y)+y = 2x implies 3y = x ] - Solving for x if y=1, then: [ 3y = x implies x = 3 ] - Resulting in the given example dimensions where x=3 gives heights and sides automatically fitting 1 times 4 times 6 dimensions neatly into the structure.

The icosahedron has 30 edges and 20 faces. 2. **Color Representation:** We can represent the colors red, white, and blue as elements of the field mathbb{F}_3 = {0, 1, 2}. This allows us to use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. Specifically, we can define a function f_i(v) for the i-th face such that f_i(v) is the sum of the colors of the edges of face i modulo 3. 3. **Vector Space Setup:** Let V = mathbb{F}_3^{30} represent the vector space of all possible colorings of the 30 edges.

If T is surjective, then text{dim}(text{im} T) = 20, and thus text{dim}(ker T) = 10. 5. **Surjectivity of T:** To show that T is surjective, we need to show that for any given face, there is a way to color the edges such that the sum of the colors around this face is 1 (or 2), and all other sums around the other faces are 0. This can be done by finding a specific coloring that satisfies this condition. 6. **Constructing a Specific Coloring:** Consider a vertex with 5 edges stemming from it. Color these edges alternately with 1, 2, 1, 2, and 1. The faces between these alternating colors will have a sum of 0 modulo 3, and since we did not touch the other faces, they will also have a sum of 0. The only face left nonzero will be the one we started with, which sums to 2 (or 1). 7. **Counting the Colorings:** Since T is surjective, the dimension of the kernel of T is 10.

Using the Law of Sines in triangle ABD, we get: [ frac{BD}{sin gamma} = frac{AD}{sin(beta - gamma)} ] Since AD is tangent to the circumcircle at A, AD = frac{a}{sin alpha}. 5. Using the Law of Sines in triangle ABC, we have: [ frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{b}{sin beta} = frac{c}{sin gamma} ] 6. Substituting AD = frac{a}{sin alpha} into the equation from step 4, we get: [ BD = frac{a sin gamma}{sin(beta - gamma)} ] 7. Using the identity sin(beta - gamma) = sin beta cos gamma - cos beta sin gamma, we get: [ BD = frac{a sin gamma}{sin beta cos gamma - cos beta sin gamma} ] 8. Using the Law of Sines in triangle ABC, we have sin alpha = frac{a}{2R}, sin beta = frac{b}{2R}, and sin gamma = frac{c}{2R}, where R is the circumradius. Substituting these into the equation for BD, we get: [ BD = frac{a cdot frac{c}{2R}}{frac{b}{2R} cos gamma - cos beta cdot frac{c}{2R}} = frac{ac}{b cos gamma - c cos beta} ] 9. Since b and c are coprime, gcd(b, c) = 1. Assume BD is an integer. Then b^2 - c^2 must divide ac^2. 10. By Euclid's algorithm, gcd(b^2 - c^2, c^2) = gcd(b^2, c^2) = gcd(b, c)^2 = 1. Hence, b^2 - c^2 must divide a. 11. Since b^2 - c^2 divides a, we have a geq |b^2 - c^2| = (b + c)(b - c) geq b + c > a, which is a contradiction. 12. Therefore, BD cannot be an integer. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Determine the domain of the function f(x)=lg (x1).","completion":"To ensure the function's expression is well-defined, the variable x must satisfy the following condition: [ x-1 > 0 ] This translates to [ x > 1 ] Therefore, the domain of the function f(x)=lg (x-1) is (1,+infty).

Specifically, we can focus on a scenario where two squares within the L-tetromino need to have different colors. This coloring overlaps with existing constraints, leading to contradictions in final color assignments. Illustration: - Color the fields as indicated in the figure. - Notice that the fields to the immediate left and right below an area must have the colors 1 and 3. Any other distribution would allow a repeated color in an L-tetromino, which is not allowed. - Consequently, the remaining adjacent fields assignable color spots conflict, reducing to no viable color for a left-field with marking differently from 1 or 3. **Step 5:** The contradiction established in Figure 1 suggests firmly that 7 colors indeed aren’t sufficient since a consistent painting without repetitive breaches in set rules proves infeasible. **Step 6:** Let's evaluate n = 8: - Refer to Figure 2, which outlines a satisfactory coloring strategy with 8 different colors. - Each L-tetromino in this setup spans four diverse colors adequately. - The constructive example holds without conflicts, covering distinct criteria seamlessly. **Conclusion:** With practical contradiction at n = 7 and comprehensive feasibility at n = 8, we deduce the smallest number of colors required is n = 8.

The relationship can be mathematically expressed as y = 2.5x + 10, where y is the length of the spring in cm, and x is the mass of the object in kg. **Statement A**: When no object is hung, the length of the spring is 10 cm. - According to the table, when the mass x = 0, the length of the spring y = 10. This directly matches the given relationship y = 2.5 cdot 0 + 10 = 10. Therefore, statement A is correct. **Statement B**: This statement suggests that the length of the spring is the independent variable and the mass of the object is a function of the length of the spring. However, based on the relationship y = 2.5x + 10, it's clear that the mass of the object (x) is the independent variable, and the length of the spring (y) is the dependent variable. Thus, statement B is incorrect. **Statement C**: For each increase of 1 kg in the mass of the hanging object, the length of the spring increases by 2.5 cm. - This is directly supported by the relationship y = 2.5x + 10, where the coefficient of x (2.5) represents the increase in length per kg of mass added. Therefore, statement C is correct. **Statement D**: When the mass of the object is 4 kg, the length of the spring is 20 cm. - Substituting x = 4 into the relationship y = 2.5x + 10 gives y = 2.5 cdot 4 + 10 = 20.

Suppose these rays intersect the inscribed circle at points P and Q respectively, and intersect the circumscribed circle at points R and S respectively. Let P be the point of tangency with the inscribed circle, and S be a vertex of the polygon. 5. **Area Considerations:** The total areas of the portions of the circles inside each sector are greater than the areas of the triangles formed with apex O and vertices at the points of intersection.
