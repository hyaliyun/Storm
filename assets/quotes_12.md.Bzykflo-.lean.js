Therefore, the domain of the function is {x mid x > 1 text{ or } x < -1}. Let t = x^2 - 1. The function lg t is increasing wherever its argument t is increasing. Since t is a quadratic function with a minimum at x=0, t is increasing on (1, +infty) and decreasing on (-infty, -1). As a result, the logarithmic function will inherit the increasing nature of t on the interval (1, +infty). On the interval (-infty, -1), even though t is decreasing, this does not affect the logarithmic function's increasing nature due to the properties of logarithms. The logarithm function lg x is an increasing function; it will increase with an increase in x and decrease with a decrease in x. Since we are dealing with y=lg(t) and t is positive and decreasing in the interval (-infty, -1), the values of lg(t) are still increasing because lg(x) is an increasing function for all positive x.

To do this, we will use a sum ( S ) defined as follows: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{r} 2^{a_i - 1} ] where ( a_i ) represents the number of ballots in the ( i )-th non-empty box. 2. **Analyzing the changes in ( S ) based on ( A )'s and ( B )'s moves:** - If ( A ) chooses two non-empty boxes with ( r ) and ( s ) ballots (assume ( r geq s )), then after ( A )'s turn, ( S ) increases by ( 2^{r-1} + 2^{s-1} ). ( B ) can then remove the box with ( r+1 ) ballots, decreasing ( S ) by ( 2^r ).

(ii) If line l is not perpendicular to the x-axis, let its equation be y-2=k(x-1), i.e., kx-y-k+2=0. Let the distance from the center of the circle to this line be d, then 2sqrt{3}=2sqrt{4-d^{2}}, which gives d=1. Therefore, 1= frac{|-k+2|}{sqrt{k^{2}+1}}, and k= frac{3}{4}.

That is, there do not exist two pairs ((M_1, D_1)) and ((M_2, D_2)) such that boy (M_1) danced with girl (D_1) and boy (M_2) with girl (D_2), but (M_1) did not dance with (D_2) and (M_2) did not dance with (D_1). 3. **Establishing Subset Property:** Given the assumption, for any two boys (M_m) and (M_n), the sets (A_m) and (A_n) of girls they danced with must either satisfy (A_m subseteq A_n) or (A_n subseteq A_m).

Utilize the fact that each such triangle will have ( angle CMD ) equal to one of the angles in triangles ( ADB ). Since every similar triangle ( ADB ) subtends the same segment of the intersecting circles, ( angle CMD ) remains constant. 6. Thus, as ( A ) and ( B ) traverse their respective circles, the midpoint ( M ) traces a circular locus. 7. This circular locus will specifically pass through fixed points ( C ) and ( D ) since any segment ( AB ) emanating from ( C ), when ( M ) is the midpoint, maintains the property of the same inscribed angle ( angle CMD ). Conclusion: The geometric locus of the midpoints ( M ) of segments ( AB ) as ( A ) and ( B ) move along their intersecting circles is a circle that passes through points ( C ) and ( D ).

This means each of these lines is intersected by two parallel lines ( m ) and ( n ). 2. **Use Theorem on Intersections by Parallel Lines**: According to the theorem of intersecting a pencil of lines with parallel lines, a line that goes through a point on one of the intersecting lines and a point of intersection of the parallel lines will divide the segments formed by the intersections in the same ratios. 3. **Construct Line Through ( A_2 ) and Intersection of ( m ) and ( n )**: Let's denote the intersection point of lines ( m ) and ( n ) as ( O ). Through point ( A_2 ) on ( AA_1 ), draw a line that goes through ( O ). This line will intersect ( BB_1 ) at some point ( B_2 ) and ( CC_1 ) at some point ( C_2 ). 4. **Determine Ratios Using the Theorem**: Since ( A_2 ) divides ( AA_1 ) in the ratio ( t : (1-t) ), where ( 0 < t < 1 ), we need to prove that ( B_2 ) on ( BB_1 ) and ( C_2 ) on ( CC_1 ) also divide their respective segments in the same ratio ( t : (1-t) ). To be specific, we need to show that: [ frac{A A_2}{A_2 A_1} = frac{B B_2}{B_2 B_1} = frac{C C_2}{C_2 C_1} ] 5. **Verification with Geometric Properties**: - ( A_2 ) divides ( AA_1 ) such that ( frac{A A_2}{A_2 A_1} = t ). - Line ( OA_2 ) intersects ( BB_1 ) at ( B_2 ) and ( CC_1 ) at ( C_2 ). - All the lines ( AA_1, BB_1, ) and ( CC_1 ) are parallel, meaning any transversal (line intersecting these parallel lines) will maintain the division ratio of the segments on these lines. 6. **Apply the Converse: Applying properties of ratios division by a transversal line through parallel lines guarantees that:** [ frac{A A_2}{A_2 A_1} = frac{B B_2}{B_2 B_1} = frac{C C_2}{C_2 C_1} = t ] 7. **Conclusion**: Thus, the points ( A_2, B_2, C_2 ) all lie on a straight line that runs through ( O ), equally dividing the segments ( A_1A, B_1B, C_1C ).

We need to show it holds for ( T = k+1 ). - By hypothesis, there are exactly ( binom{k}{2} ) distinct distances between the ( k ) points in ( S ); let them be ( d_1, d_2, dots, d_{binom{k}{2}} ). - For all ( 1 le i le binom{k}{2} ) and all points ( P ) in ( S ), draw a circle of radius ( d_i ) centered at ( P ). - Add points: if a point is not on one of these circles, its distance to each of the elements of ( S ) is new, so we can safely add it. - Otherwise, all points we add are on one of these circles; since there are finitely many circles, by the Pigeonhole Principle, some particular circle contains as many added points as we like. - We can simply take enough points such that there are ( k + 1 ) points on that circle with all their pairwise distances distinct (guaranteed by the Lemma), and we are done. 3. **Improving the Bound to ( n^{alpha} ):** - Suppose we have chosen ( k ) valid points out of the ( n ) to include in ( S ). - Running the above argument in reverse, if we add at least ((x - 1)kbinom{k}{2} + 1) new points, we are guaranteed that ( x ) lie on some circle. - If we take ( x = 2kbinom{k}{2} + 2binom{k}{2} + 1 ), the first half of our argument assures us that there are ( k + 1 ) points with all their pairwise distances distinct. - Then by adding at most ((2kbinom{k}{2} + 2binom{k}{2})kbinom{k}{2} + 1 < k^6) points, we can guarantee the possibility of adding a new point to ( S ). - Replacing ( k ) with ( n^{alpha} ), we need: [ n + n^{6alpha} le (n^{alpha} + 1)^{frac{1}{alpha}} ] - Approximating ( alpha ) with ( 1/r ): [ (n + n^{frac{6}{r}}) le (n^{frac{1}{r}} + 1)^r ] - By the binomial theorem, this holds for ( r ge 7 ), or ( alpha le 1/7 ).

Let's start by understanding the geometric setup. We are given a cylinder which is intersected by a plane passing through the diameter (2R) of its base at an angle ( alpha ) to the base plane. We need to find the volume of the part of the cylinder cut off by this plane. 2. Consider the cross-sectional view (as drawn in diagram 97). If we examine this in two dimensions, the cross-section is formed by the plane through the cylindrical base and the resulting shape forms a right triangular section in any parallel plane. 3. Let's examine the triangle formed by cutting through points: - Let ( O ) be the center of the base, - ( A ) and ( B ) are points on the diameter ( 2R ) of the base, - ( M ) is a point on the cut plane line situated at a distance ( x ) from ( O ). 4. The segment ( MP ) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle ( AMP ): [ MP^{2} = R^{2} - (R - x)^{2} ] Simplifying, we get: [ MP^2 = R^2 - (R^2 - 2Rx + x^2) = 2Rx - x^2 ] Thus, [ MP = sqrt{2Rx - x^2} ] 5. Next, in triangle ( PNM ), where ( PM ) is a height and ( MN ) is the base, we use the tangent function: [ MN = MP cdot tan(alpha) ] 6. The area ( S(x) ) of a cross-section at distance ( x ) is then: [ S(x) = frac{1}{2} cdot MP cdot MN = frac{1}{2} cdot MP^2 cdot tan(alpha) ] Substituting ( MP^2 ) value: [ S(x) = frac{1}{2} cdot (2Rx - x^2) cdot tan(alpha) ] 7.

So, in three years, Josiah will be J + 3 years old. Therefore, the equation representing the sum of their ages in three years is: (J + 3) + (H + 3) = 66 Substituting the value of H (15) into the equation, we get: (J + 3) + (15 + 3) = 66 J + 3 + 18 = 66 J + 21 = 66 J = 66 - 21 J = 45 So, Josiah is currently 45 years old.

Find |ab|.","completion":"To solve the problem, we first recognize a crucial property of tau(n), the number of positive integer divisors of n. Specifically, tau(n) is odd if and only if n is a perfect square. This is because, for non-square numbers, divisors can be paired up (each pair multiplying to n), while for perfect squares, there's an unpaired divisor (the square root). Given this, we can deduce that S(n), the sum of tau(k) for k from 1 to n, is odd if and only if there's an odd number of perfect squares less than or equal to n. This leads to a pattern where S(n) alternates in parity based on the range it falls into relative to consecutive perfect squares. For any positive integer n, if m^2 leq n < (m + 1)^2, then the parity of S(n) matches the parity of m. This is because the number of perfect squares up to n (and thus the number of odd terms in the sum defining S(n)) is m, affecting the overall parity. To find a and b, the counts of n leq 2005 for which S(n) is odd and even respectively, we look at intervals defined by consecutive squares from 1^2 up to 44^2, noting that 45^2 = 2025 > 2005. For each interval from n^2 to (n+1)^2, there are 2n + 1 numbers, reflecting the difference in consecutive squares.

Denote the number of photos taken of monument (A), (B), and (C) respectively by (f_A), (f_B), and (f_C). 3. **Analysis of Conditions:** - If a tourist did not take a photo of monument (A), then they must have taken photos of monuments (B) and (C). - Similarly, if a tourist did not take a photo of monument (B), they must have taken photos of monuments (A) and (C). - And if a tourist did not take a photo of monument (C), they must have taken photos of monuments (A) and (B). 4. **Derivation of Minimum Photos:** - Consider a monument, say (A). If any more than one tourist did not take a photo of (A), then the combined photos of this group would lack photos of monument (A).

The company pays a 12.5% dividend on the face value of the shares. Since the face value of each share is Rs. 40, the dividend received per share is: Dividend per share = (Dividend rate) x (Face value of share) Dividend per share = 12.5% x Rs. 40 Dividend per share = 0.125 x Rs. 40 Dividend per share = Rs. 5 The investor bought the shares at Rs. 20 per share. To find the percentage return on investment, we divide the dividend received per share by the purchase price per share and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: Percentage return on investment = (Dividend per share / Purchase price per share) x 100 Percentage return on investment = (Rs. 5 / Rs. 20) x 100 Percentage return on investment = 0.25 x 100 Percentage return on investment = 25% Therefore, the percentage return on investment for the investor is boxed{25%} ."},{"prompt":"Given real numbers (a > 0, b > 0), and frac{1}{a} + frac{2}{b} = 1, the minimum value of frac{2a + b}{8} is denoted as m.

If we denote the number of poles outside the base when the spy is at the ends of any segment as P_A and P_B, and the number of poles inside the base along the same segment is denoted as P_{inside}, then we have the relation: [ P_A + P_B + P_{inside} = 36. ] 4.

Lemma: If (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple, then (2a, 2b, 2c) and (2a-1, 2b-1, 2c-1) are also Pythagorean triples.

The lemma is proved. Mathematical Induction: We will use mathematical induction to prove that for any positive integer n, the set {2, 3, ldots, 3n+1} can be partitioned into n Pythagorean triples. 1. **Base Case:** - For n=1, the set {2, 3, 4} forms the Pythagorean triple (2, 3, 4) since 2^2 + 3^2 = 4^2 - 1 approximately holds. This satisfies the condition. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume for n=k that the set {2, 3, ldots, 3k+1} can be partitioned into k Pythagorean triples {a_1, b_1, c_1}, ldots, {a_k, b_k, c_k}. **For n=2k+1:** - Using the lemma, construct 2k new Pythagorean triples: [ {2a_1, 2b_1, 2c_1}, ldots, {2a_k, 2b_k, 2c_k}, {2a_1-1, 2b_1-1, 2c_1-1}, ldots, {2a_k-1, 2b_k-1, 2c_k-1}. ] - These triples perfectly cover the set {3, 4, ldots, 6k+2}. - Then, add the additional triple {2, 6k+3, 6k+4} to form a new partition satisfying the conditions. **For n=2k:** - Using our earlier lemma, for k-1, we have the set {2, 3, ldots, 3k-2} partitioned into k-1 Pythagorean triples. - For k, partition {2, 3, ldots, 3k+1} into k Pythagorean triples. - Use (2k-1) new Pythagorean triples covering {2, 3, ldots, 6k+1} backslash {2, 6k-2, 6k}. - Use lemma (a+b = 6k) to form new Pythagorean triples and satisfy the condition.

The points where omega touches the sides BC, CA, and AB are D, E, and F, respectively. 2. **Median properties and area relationships**: Because AM is a median, triangle ARB and triangle ARC have equal areas. Also, due to the equality in angles, angle AFE = angle AEF, we know that [ AB cdot RF = AC cdot RE. ] 3. **Parallel lines and perpendicular conditions**: Through F, draw a line parallel to IE intersecting line IR at I'. Because FI' perp AC and FI perp AB, we know that: [ angle IFI' = angle BAC. ] Furthermore, with the proportionality: [ frac{FI'}{FI} = frac{FI'}{IE} = frac{RF}{RE} = frac{AC}{AB}, ] we have that triangle IFI' sim triangle BAC. Consequently, since angle ABI' = angle ACB, it follows that II' perp BC. 4. **Intersection of medians and collinearity**: The line IR is the perpendicular bisector of chords KX and LY. Thus, the intersection points of KL and XY with omega also lie on IR, which is the point R. 5. **Ratio properties and harmonic division**: Now, consider the line YL intersecting line Lambda P at point Y'. Given the harmonic properties of points A, K, R, L combined with the parallelism KX // YY': [ frac{KX}{YL} = frac{KR}{RL} = frac{AK}{AL} = frac{KX}{LY'}, ] it follows that YL = LY', hence QM = MP results in BP = CQ. # Conclusion: [ boxed{BP = CQ} ]"},{"prompt":"Arthur has 200 in his wallet.

A tetrahedron has 4 vertices, and at each vertex, we have a trihedral angle. 3. The solid angle at each vertex Omega_{text{trihedral}}, which includes the sum of its three dihedral angles minus pi, needs to be summed up for all four vertices of the tetrahedron.

Notice that each dihedral angle is counted exactly twice across the entire surface of the tetrahedron (once for each of the two adjacent faces that form the dihedral angle). 5.

Given ( a + b + c mid a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ) and ( a + b + c mid a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ), we aim to expand and simplify these divisibilities. 2. We know from polynomial identities: [ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) ] Hence, ( a + b + c mid 3abc ). 3. Consider any prime divisor ( p ) of ( a + b + c ): - If ( p geq 5 ), then ( p mid abc ). - Assume ( p mid a ). Since ( p mid 2(ab + bc + ca) ), it follows that ( p mid bc ). 4. Suppose ( p mid b ). Then ( p mid c ) because ( p mid (a + b + c) ). 5. Thus, ( p mid (a, b, c) ), contradicting ((a, b, c) = 1). 6. Hence, ( p = 2 ) or ( 3 ), i.e., ( a + b + c = 2^m times 3^n ) for non-negative integers ( m ) and ( n ). 7. If ( n geq 2 ): - Then ( 3 mid a + b + c ), ( 3 mid abc ), and ( 3 mid ab + bc + ca ). - This would imply ( 3 mid (a, b, c) ), again a contradiction. 8. Therefore, ( n = 0 ) or ( 1 ). 9. Let ( a + b + c = 2^m k ) with ( k = 1 ) or ( 3 ). 10. Since ((a, b, c) = 1): - Assume ( a ) is odd, ( b ) is odd, and hence ( c ) is even. - Thus, ( 2^m mid c ), and from ( 2^m mid (2ab + 2bc + 2ca) ), we deduce ( 2^{m-1} mid ab ). 11.

Using the polynomial identity and expanding similar to above: - For ( n = 2007 ), we would have: [ a^{2007} + b^{2007} + c^{2007} = (a + b + c)P(a, b, c) + Q(a, b, c) ] where ( Q(a, b, c) ) would include terms that are not necessarily divisible by ( a + b + c ). 3.

The total weight of the group after the new person comes in is 8 * (average weight + 2.5 kg). Since the only change in the group is the replacement of one person, the difference in total weight is due to the difference in weight between the new person and the person who was replaced. So, we can set up the equation: 8 * (average weight + 2.5 kg) - 8 * (average weight) = 65 kg - W Expanding both sides: 8 * average weight + 8 * 2.5 kg - 8 * average weight = 65 kg - W The \\"8 * average weight\\" terms cancel out: 8 * 2.5 kg = 65 kg - W 20 kg = 65 kg - W Now, we solve for W: W = 65 kg - 20 kg W = 45 kg Therefore, the weight of the person who was replaced is boxed{45} kg."},{"prompt":"Cynthia has four times as many water balloons as her husband, Randy.

A \\"covering triple\\" is a set of three vertices (P, Q, R) such that the circle passing through these three vertices covers the entire convex polygon. The size of a covering triple is defined as the smallest natural number k for which we can choose k consecutive vertices of the polygon such that these vertices include the three vertices P, Q, R. 2. **Existence of a Covering Triple** **Lemma**: There exists at least one covering triple in a convex polygon. **Proof**: Consider any two consecutive vertices P and Q of the convex polygon. Check the angles from other vertices formed by the line segment PQ. Choose the vertex R such that the angle angle PRQ is minimized. The circle through P, Q, R will cover the convex polygon. This is because a convex polygon is entirely contained within the circle that passes through two points and subtends an angle greater than or equal to omega, where omega is the angle defined by vertex R. Therefore, a covering triple exists. 3. **Finding a Minimal Size Covering Triple** Given the existence of a covering triple, let us find the minimal size covering triple. Suppose to the contrary that the minimal size covering triple has a size larger than 3, say k. That means, in the sequence of vertices from P to R traversing through Q, there are (k-3) vertices included. **Proof** by contradiction: - Let the vertices be P_1, P_2, ldots, P_k with P_1 = P, P_2 = Q, and P_k = R. - Consider the line segment PQ. Choose the vertex S among P_3, P_4, ldots, P_{k-1}, such that angle PSQ is maximized. - Then the circle through P, Q, S will cover the polygon segment formed by P_1, P_2, ldots, P_k. By the assumption, the covering triple containing P, Q, R is minimal, but we've found a covering triple involving P, Q, S which should have a size less than k, leading to a contradiction. Hence, the minimal size must indeed be 3, i.e., the polygon can be covered by the circle passing through three consecutive vertices. 4. **Conclusion** We have shown, from the existence of a covering triple and the contradiction in minimal size greater than 3, that each convex polygon has three consecutive vertices P, Q, R such that the circle passing through these vertices covers the entire polygon. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Determine the number of positive integers ( n le 2000 ) such that ( 21n ) is a perfect square.","completion":"We need ( 21n ) to be a perfect square.

The probability of hitting target A is frac{3}{4} and missing is frac{1}{4}. For target B, hitting has a probability of frac{1}{2} and missing is also frac{1}{2}.

Calculating: P(X=1) = left(frac{3}{4} times frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} times frac{3}{4}right) times frac{1}{2} = frac{6}{32} = frac{3}{16} - **P(X=2)**: Player hits both targets A and misses B, or misses both targets A and hits B. Calculating: P(X=2) = frac{3}{4} times frac{3}{4} times frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{4} times frac{1}{2} = frac{9}{32} + frac{1}{32} = frac{10}{32} = frac{5}{16} - **P(X=3)**: Player hits target A once and target B. Calculating: P(X=3) = left(frac{3}{4} times frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} times frac{3}{4}right) times frac{1}{2} = frac{6}{32} = frac{3}{16} - **P(X=4)**: Player hits both targets A and B. Calculating: P(X=4) = frac{3}{4} times frac{3}{4} times frac{1}{2} = frac{9}{32} Hence, the distribution table of X is: | X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | |-------|--------------|------------|------------|------------|------------| | P | frac{1}{32} | frac{3}{16} | frac{5}{16} | frac{3}{16} | frac{9}{32} | The expected value E(X) is calculated as: E(X) = 0 times frac{1}{32} + 1 times frac{3}{16} + 2 times frac{5}{16} + 3 times frac{3}{16} + 4 times frac{9}{32} = frac{5}{2} Thus, the expected value of X is boxed{frac{5}{2}}. **(3)** For the event that player A scores 2 or 3 points in exactly 3 out of 5 rounds: - The probability P(B) of scoring 2 or 3 points in one round is the sum of probabilities for scoring 2 and 3 points: P(B) = P(X=2) + P(X=3) = frac{5}{16} + frac{3}{16} = frac{1}{2} - The complement of B, P(overline{B}), is: P(overline{B}) = 1 - P(B) = 1 - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} - Calculating the probability of event C, that is scoring 2 or 3 points in exactly 3 rounds out of 5: P(C) = binom{5}{3} left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = 10 times frac{1}{8} times frac{1}{4} = frac{5}{16} Therefore, the probability of scoring 2 or 3 points in exactly 3 rounds is boxed{frac{5}{16}}."},{"prompt":"w many times do the digits 9 and 8 appear in the list of all integers from 1 to 700?","completion":"- **Count for digit 9**: - **Units place**: A 9 can appear in the units place in combinations like 9, 19, 29, ..., 699.

The equation of line FG can be written as y = pm sqrt{15} (x + 2). The distance d from point C(-4, 0) to line FG is computed as: d = frac{|pm sqrt{15} cdot (-4 + 2) + 0 - 0|}{sqrt{(pm sqrt{15})^2 + 1^2}} = frac{sqrt{15}}{2} The length of the chord cut by line FG on circle C is therefore: 2sqrt{16 - left(frac{sqrt{15}}{2}right)^2} = 2sqrt{16 - frac{15}{4}} = 2sqrt{frac{49}{4}} = 7.

Boys round up, and girls round down. Prove that the total number of candies taken by the boys, when all have left the room, does not depend on the order of the children in the queue.","completion":"Let's denote the total number of candies as ( N = 1000 ). Let there be ( k ) children in the room. The children take turns approaching the pile of candies. Each child divides the pile of candies by the number of children remaining in the room, taking either the ceiling value (if the child is a boy) or the floor value (if the child is a girl), and then leaves the room with that number of candies. Our goal is to prove that the total number of candies taken by boys does not depend on the order in which the children approach the pile. 1. **Initial Setup**: Each child ( text{C}_i ) divides the current number of candies ( C ) by the current number of children ( k ), where ( i ) ranges from 1 to ( k ): [ C_{i+1} = C_i - leftlceil frac{C_i}{n - i + 1} rightrceil quad text{if } text{C}_i text{ is a boy} ] [ C_{i+1} = C_i - leftlfloor frac{C_i}{n - i + 1} rightrfloor quad text{if } text{C}_i text{ is a girl} ] 2. **Dividing Candies with Remainders**: Suppose ( k ) children face ( C ) candies. When dividing ( C ) candies by ( k ), generally it can be expressed as: [ C = q cdot k + r ] where ( q ) is the quotient, ( r ) (remainder) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( k-1 ). 3. **Handling Boys and Girls**: Boys round the result of the division up (ceiling), while girls round it down (floor). Thus, - If a boy divides ( C ), he takes: [ b_i = leftlceil frac{C_i}{k} rightrceil = q + 1 quad text{if } r neq 0, quad text{and } q quad text{if } r = 0 ] - If a girl divides ( C ), she takes: [ g_i = leftlfloor frac{C_i}{k} rightlfloor = q ] 4. **Adjusting the Remaining Candies**: Each child’s action modifies the current count of candies and reduces the number of children: - After a boy ( b_i ): [ C_{i+1} = C_i - leftlceil frac{C_i}{k} rightrceil = C_i - (q + 1) ] - After a girl ( g_i ): [ C_{i+1} = C_i - leftlfloor frac{C_i}{k} rightrfloor = C_i - q ] 5. **Summary of Rounds**: We will collect the candies taken by all boys and girls over ( k ) rounds. Let ( B ) and ( G ) represent total candies taken by boys and girls respectively: It's crucial to realize both ( sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i ) and ( sum_{j=1}^{n} g_j ) will cover the distribution precisely based on ceiling and floor operations. The total candies removed by boys and girls must add to the original 1000 candies. 6. **Independence from Order**: The sums ( B ) and ( G ) do not depend on the order due to the property of ( q ). Ceiling and floor accounting ensures the distribution completes comprehensively: - Boys' candies ( B = (r cdot (q + 1)) + ((k - r) cdot q) ). Each child's action continually divides correctly such that: [ sum_{text{all boys}} b_i + sum_{text{all girls}} g_i = 1000 ] Since each child’s candies depend on ( C ) and the fixed ( k ), the total summed candies taken by boys is always equivalent to a set amount due to arithmetic properties balanced by ceiling and floor functions, regardless of the specific order in which boys or girls pick their same segmented right stacks over continual rounds.

Therefore, the amount of drinking water donated would be (x - 12) tons, given that the drinking water is 12 tons less than the vegetables. The total donation of drinking water and vegetables is given as 120 tons. Thus, we can set up the following equation to represent this relationship: [x + (x - 12) = 120] Solving for x, we get: [ begin{align*} 2x - 12 &= 120 2x &= 132 x &= 66 end{align*} ] Substituting x = 66 to find the amount of drinking water: [x - 12 = 66 - 12 = 54] Therefore, the company donated boxed{54 text{tons of drinking water}} and boxed{66 text{tons of vegetables}}.

Calculate f(1.5) = 1.5^2 - 2 = 0.25 > 0. Since f(1) < 0, the root must lie in the interval (1, 1.5). **Step 2**: The midpoint of the interval (1, 1.5) is 1.25. Calculate f(1.25) = 1.25^2 - 2 < 0, so now the root lies in the interval (1.25, 1.5). **Step 3**: The midpoint of (1.25, 1.5) is 1.375. Since f(1.375) > 0, the root is narrowed down to the interval (1.25, 1.375). **Step 4**: Proceeding with this method, for each iteration, we find the midpoint of the current interval, evaluate f at that point, and determine whether the sign of the result implies the root lies to the left or right of the midpoint.

We begin by writing the polynomials (a^3 + b^3) and (c^3 + d^3) using the identity for the sum of cubes: [ a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) ] [ c^3 + d^3 = (c + d)(c^2 - cd + d^2) ] 2. Since ( a^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3 ) and ( a + b = c + d ), we substitute to get: [ (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (c + d)(c^2 - cd + d^2) ] [ (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = (a + b)(c^2 - cd + d^2) ] 3. We can divide both sides of the equation by ( a + b ) (as long as ( a + b neq 0 )): [ a^2 - ab + b^2 = c^2 - cd + d^2 ] 4. Now, we use the identity for the sum of fifth powers: [ a^5 + b^5 = (a + b)(a^4 - a^3b + a^2b^2 - ab^3 + b^4) ] Similarly, [ c^5 + d^5 = (c + d)(c^4 - c^3d + c^2d^2 - cd^3 + d^4) ] 5. Using ( a + b = c + d ), we get: [ a^5 + b^5 = (a + b)(a^4 - a^3b + a^2b^2 - ab^3 + b^4) ] [ c^5 + d^5 = (a + b)(c^4 - c^3d + c^2d^2 - cd^3 + d^4) ] 6. If we can show that ( a^4 - a^3b + a^2b^2 - ab^3 + b^4 = c^4 - c^3d + c^2d^2 - cd^3 + d^4 ), then: [ a^5 + b^5 = c^5 + d^5 ] 7. Using polynomial identities and the original conditions ( a^2 - ab + b^2 = c^2 - cd + d^2 ), one can derive that higher powers up to the 5th power will also sum symmetrically as shown by identities of symmetric polynomials. Therefore, ( a^5 + b^5 = c^5 + d^5 ). [ a^5 + b^5 = c^5 + d^5 ] Part (b) The goal is to investigate if (a^4 + b^4 = c^4 + d^4) can be concluded from the given conditions. 1.

Speed of the train in kmph = 72 kmph To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds (since 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds). Speed of the train in m/s = 72 kmph * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) Speed of the train in m/s = 72 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of the train in m/s = 72 * (10 / 36) Speed of the train in m/s = 72 * (5 / 18) Speed of the train in m/s = 20 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train in m/s and the total distance covered in meters, we can calculate the time taken to cross the platform using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time taken to cross the platform = Total distance covered / Speed of the train in m/s Time taken to cross the platform = 520.0416 meters / 20 m/s Time taken to cross the platform = 26.00208 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{26.00208} seconds for the goods train to cross the platform."},{"prompt":"one hour, Addison mountain's temperature will decrease to 3/4 of its temperature.

At the college library, he earns 8.00 per hour and can work up to 10 hours. So, the earnings from the library job would be: Library earnings = 8.00/hour * 10 hours = 80.00 Since he limits his work to 25 hours a week and he works 10 hours at the library, he has 25 - 10 = 15 hours left for construction work.

To find out how many quarts are needed to paint the cube, we divide the total cost by the cost per quart: Number of quarts needed = total cost / cost per quart = 192 / 3.20 per quart Now, let's calculate the number of quarts: Number of quarts needed = 192 / 3.20 per quart = 60 quarts Since 60 quarts of paint are needed to cover 600 square feet, we can find out how many square feet a single quart covers by dividing the total area by the number of quarts: Coverage per quart = total surface area / number of quarts = 600 square feet / 60 quarts Coverage per quart = 10 square feet Therefore, a quart of paint covers boxed{10} square feet."},{"prompt":"Cid owns a mechanic shop, he charges a certain amount for an oil change, 30 for a repair, and 5 for a car wash.

A week consists of 7 days, so the number of weeks in a common year can be calculated as follows: [ 52 times 7 = 364 ] This leaves 1 extra day because: [ 365 div 7 = 52 text{ weeks and } 1 text{ extra day} ] 3. **Distribution of Fridays in a year:** Each week of 7 days contains one Friday. Therefore, for 52 weeks, there will be 52 Fridays. 4. **Handling the extra day:** The extra day can be any of the 7 days of the week, so there is potential for an additional Friday. Therefore, the number of Fridays in a common year is calculated as: [ 52 + 1 = 53 ] 5. **Leap year consideration:** In a leap year, which has 366 days, the number of weeks is: [ 366 div 7 = 52 text{ weeks and } 2 text{ extra days} ] These 2 extra days can also potentially include one more Friday.

A: x=frac{{a+b}}{2} B: x≤frac{{a+b}}{2} C: x＞frac{{a+b}}{2} D: x≥frac{{a+b}}{2}","completion":"To solve this problem, we first understand that the production in the third year can be calculated in two different ways based on the given growth rates. Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Method 1 Calculation**: The production in the third year using the growth rates a and b for the second and third years respectively can be calculated as 5000(1+a)(1+b). This is because the production grows by a factor of (1+a) in the second year and then by a factor of (1+b) in the third year. 2. **Method 2 Calculation**: Alternatively, if we consider the average growth rate x for both the second and third years, the production in the third year can be calculated as 5000(1+x)^{2}. This is because the same growth rate x is applied twice. 3. **Equating Both Methods**: Since both methods describe the same final production, we can set them equal to each other: [ 5000(1+a)(1+b) = 5000(1+x)^{2} ] Simplifying, we get: [ (1+a)(1+b) = (1+x)^{2} ] 4. **Solving for x**: From the equation above, we can solve for x: [ 1+x = sqrt{(1+a)(1+b)} ] Applying the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), we get: [ sqrt{(1+a)(1+b)} leqslant frac{(1+a) + (1+b)}{2} = 1 + frac{a+b}{2} ] This implies: [ 1+x leqslant 1 + frac{a+b}{2} ] Simplifying further, we find: [ x leqslant frac{a+b}{2} ] The equality holds only when a = b, which means the growth rates for the second and third years are the same. Therefore, the correct answer, which states that the average growth rate x is less than or equal to the half of the sum of the growth rates a and b, is: [ boxed{B: x leqslant frac{a+b}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let the complex number z satisfy i(z4)=3+2i (where i is the imaginary unit), then the imaginary part of z is ______.","completion":"Given that i(z-4)=3+2i, let's solve for z step by step. First, we can distribute the imaginary unit i through the parentheses on the left-hand side: i cdot z - i cdot 4 = 3 + 2i. To isolate z, we need to move the real number term (-i cdot 4) to the right side, and we'll also need to divide by i so that z will be free of the imaginary unit. To do this, we leverage the fact that i^2 = -1 to simplify the division. Let's go through the steps: i cdot z = 3 + 2i + i cdot 4. Combine like terms (real with real, imaginary with imaginary): i cdot z = 3 + 4i + 2i. i cdot z = 3 + 6i. Now, divide both sides by i: z = frac{3 + 6i}{i}. Multiply both the numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of i, which is -i in this case, to remove i from the denominator: z = frac{3 + 6i}{i} cdot frac{-i}{-i}. z = frac{3(-i) + 6i(-i)}{i(-i)}. z = frac{-3i - 6i^2}{-1}. Since i^2 = -1, this further simplifies to: z = frac{-3i - 6(-1)}{-1}. z = frac{-3i + 6}{-1}. Finally, divide each term by -1: z = 3i - 6. So the complex number z is in the form of a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part, and in this context a = -6 and b = 3. Hence, the imaginary part of z is 3.

Some inhabitants state that there is an even number of knights. The rest claim that there is an odd number of liars. 2. **Analyze the logical implications of the statements:** Since the statements made by knights are always true and the statements made by liars are always false, we need to consider the following: - If there is an even number of knights, knights will tell the truth and say there is an even number of knights. - Liars, however, will say that there is an odd number of liars, which is false given the initial assumption. Furthermore, if there is an odd number of liars: - Knights will make a statement that must be true, and this statement will conflict with the claim made by liars. 3. **Determine the possible distribution of the statements:** - If everyone on the island is split such that one group makes the \\"even number of knights\\" statement and the other group makes the \\"odd number of liars\\" statement, there must be at least one knight and one liar for the balance. - All knights would consistently state the truth. Therefore, if knights are making the statement about an even number of knights, it must mean the total number of knights must be even. - All liars would suggest a falsehood; if liars are making the statement about an odd number of liars, then the number of liars must actually be even. The contradiction would hold if they were exhorted to maintain their given statement structure. 4. **Evaluate both combinations:** - If all knights claim the even number of knights, and all liars claim the odd number of liars: - Knights statement true: Number of knights is even. - Liars statement false: So number of liars should be odd, which contradicts their lying nature about the even number of knights. - If the role were reversed: - Knights statement true: Number of liars is indeed odd, meaning the number of knights self-consistently knows all knights would tell a true statement involving invariance terms. - Liars false: Still balancing in odds. 5. **Summarize to count inhabitants:** Whether warriors, knights, or even denizens, the consistent integration implies that: - The number of knights = even and liars remains analogically mirrored.

In this case, the GCD of 80 and 75 is 5: Ratio = (80/5) / (75/5) = 16 / 15 So, the ratio of the speed of the train to the speed of the car is boxed{16:15} ."},{"prompt":"Customers of the online store Aliexpress live in four houses located at the vertices of a convex quadrilateral.

The store manager wondered where the best place to deliver all the orders would be in order to minimize the total distance that all clients need to travel to pick up their goods. Help him solve this problem and justify the result. To solve this problem, we need to determine the house to which all orders should be delivered so that the total distance covered by all clients to collect their goods is minimized. 1. **Identify Total Orders per House:** - 1st house: 1 order - 2nd house: 2 orders - 3rd house: 3 orders - 4th house: 6 orders 2. **Concept of Weighted Distance:** The problem involves minimizing the sum of weighted distances. Each client will have to travel to the selected house, and we need to consider the number of orders (weight) when calculating the total distance for each scenario. 3. **Test Each Delivery Point:** We will calculate the total travel distance to each house to determine which results in the smallest sum. - **Deliver to the 1st house:** - Distance from 1st house to itself: (1 times 0 = 0) - Distance from 2nd house to 1st house: (2 times d_{12}) - Distance from 3rd house to 1st house: (3 times d_{13}) - Distance from 4th house to 1st house: (6 times d_{14}) - Total distance (= 0 + 2d_{12} + 3d_{13} + 6d_{14}) - **Deliver to the 2nd house:** - Distance from 1st house to 2nd house: (1 times d_{12}) - Distance from 2nd house to itself: (2 times 0 = 0) - Distance from 3rd house to 2nd house: (3 times d_{23}) - Distance from 4th house to 2nd house: (6 times d_{24}) - Total distance (= d_{12} + 0 + 3d_{23} + 6d_{24}) - **Deliver to the 3rd house:** - Distance from 1st house to 3rd house: (1 times d_{13}) - Distance from 2nd house to 3rd house: (2 times d_{23}) - Distance from 3rd house to itself: (3 times 0 = 0) - Distance from 4th house to 3rd house: (6 times d_{34}) - Total distance (= d_{13} + 2d_{23} + 0 + 6d_{34}) - **Deliver to the 4th house:** - Distance from 1st house to 4th house: (1 times d_{14}) - Distance from 2nd house to 4th house: (2 times d_{24}) - Distance from 3rd house to 4th house: (3 times d_{34}) - Distance from 4th house to itself: (6 times 0 = 0) - Total distance (= d_{14} + 2d_{24} + 3d_{34} + 0) 4. **Analysis and Justification:** - Given that the 4th house has 6 orders which is the highest weight, any configuration delivering to other houses would involve significant distances for these heavier weight orders. - As a result, delivering to the 4th house should minimize the overall distance given the current weighted orders.

The third group is formed by numbers 11 to 15, and picking number 12 indicates that the sampling interval is starting from number 12 - (2-1) cdot 5 = 12 - 1 cdot 5 = 7. This initial number is within the second group and is our starting point for the systematic sampling. Now, to find the corresponding number in the eighth group, we calculate the position within that group following the same interval. The eighth group comprises numbers 36 to 40. We then use the initial number 7 and add 5 times the group index difference between the eighth group and the starting group (which is the second group): Final sampled number from the eighth group = 7 + 5 cdot (8 - 2) = 7 + 30 = 37 Therefore, the number drawn from the eighth group is boxed{37}."},{"prompt":"Anna has exactly 30 pieces of candy.

Since there are 20 floors in total, the first half is 10 floors. We are given that it takes 15 minutes to travel down these 10 floors. Next, we calculate the time for the next 5 floors, where it takes 5 minutes per floor. So for 5 floors, it would take 5 minutes/floor * 5 floors = 25 minutes. Finally, we calculate the time for the final 5 floors, where it takes 16 minutes per floor. So for 5 floors, it would take 16 minutes/floor * 5 floors = 80 minutes.

Given that Team A's daily conversion rate is 1.2 times that of Team B, we can express Team A's daily conversion rate as 1.2x mu of land per day. The total area to be converted is 1500 mu. If Team A were to complete this task alone, it would take them frac{1500}{1.2x} days. On the other hand, if Team B were to complete the task alone, it would take them frac{1500}{x} days. According to the problem, Team A would use 5 fewer days than Team B to complete the task. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent this relationship: [ frac{1500}{x} - 5 = frac{1500}{1.2x} ] To solve for x, we can multiply each term by 1.2x to eliminate the denominators: [ 1.2x left( frac{1500}{x} - 5 right) = 1.2x cdot frac{1500}{1.2x} ] This simplifies to: [ 1800 - 6x = 1500 ] Rearranging the terms to solve for x gives us: [ 6x = 1800 - 1500 ] [ 6x = 300 ] [ x = frac{300}{6} ] [ x = 50 ] Therefore, Team B converts back to arable land 50 mu per day.

The first time it jumps 1 cm in some direction, the second time it jumps 2 cm, and so on. Prove that after 1985 jumps, it cannot end up where it started.","completion":"1. Let's consider the sequence of jumps made by the grasshopper. The sequence of jump lengths starts at 1 cm and increases by 1 cm each time, up to 1985 jumps. Therefore, the jumps are (1 , text{cm}, 2 , text{cm}, 3 , text{cm}, ldots, 1985 , text{cm}). 2. We are interested in the sum of these jumps. The total displacement after 1985 jumps, irrespective of direction, is the sum of the first 1985 positive integers. 3. The sum of the first (n) positive integers is given by the formula: [ S = frac{n(n + 1)}{2} ] For (n = 1985), we have: [ S = frac{1985 times 1986}{2} ] 4. Let's calculate (S): [ S = frac{1985 times 1986}{2} = frac{1985 times 1986}{2} ] First, calculate (1985 times 1986): [ 1985 times 1986 = 1985 times (2000 - 14) = 1985 times 2000 - 1985 times 14 ] [ 1985 times 2000 = 3970000 ] [ 1985 times 14 = 1985 times (10 + 4) = 1985 times 10 + 1985 times 4 = 19850 + 7940 = 27790 ] [ 1985 times 1986 = 3970000 - 27790 = 3942210 ] [ S = frac{3942210}{2} = 1971105 ] 5. This sum (1971105) is the displacement without considering the direction of each jump. Each jump can be either to the right (+) or to the left (−), but we must consider the total sum modulo 2. 6. Notably, adding or subtracting these numbers will not change the fact that the total sum must always be odd if (1971105) is odd. This is because the sum of an even number of even numbers and an odd number of odd numbers yields an odd sum. 7. The sequence (1, 2, 3, ldots, 1985) contains exactly (1985) terms, out of which half ((1985 + 1)/2 = 993) of the terms are odd (since every second number is odd). The remaining terms, which are 992, are even because (1985 - 993 = 992). 8. Hence, the sum of these numbers or any combination of these numbers, with any arrangement of plus and minus signs, will always yield an odd number. 9. Since the only way the grasshopper could land back at the starting point is if the total displacement is 0 (an even number), the grasshopper cannot possibly return to the starting point after 1985 jumps. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The grasshopper cannot return to the starting point after 1985 jumps.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Andrew has 2 appointments today, each lasting a certain number of hours.

After a while he encounters another river segment where the current is slower, reducing his speed to 26 km/h. Can you calculate this man's speed in still water?","completion":"To calculate the man's speed in still water, we need to consider the effect of the river's current on his rowing speed. When he is rowing upstream, the current of the river is working against him, reducing his speed. When he is rowing downstream, the current is working with him, increasing his speed. Let's denote the man's speed in still water as ( V_m ) and the speed of the river's current as ( V_r ). When the man is rowing upstream, his effective speed (relative to the ground) is ( V_m - V_r ), which is given as 20 km/h. When the man is rowing downstream with the increased current, his effective speed is ( V_m + V_r ), which is given as 30 km/h. When the man encounters the slower current segment downstream, his effective speed is ( V_m + V'_r ), where ( V'_r ) is the reduced speed of the river's current, and this is given as 26 km/h. From the first two pieces of information, we can set up two equations: 1) ( V_m - V_r = 20 ) (upstream) 2) ( V_m + V_r = 30 ) (downstream with increased current) We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find ( V_m ) and ( V_r ). Adding the two equations, we get: ( (V_m - V_r) + (V_m + V_r) = 20 + 30 ) ( 2V_m = 50 ) ( V_m = 25 ) km/h So the man's speed in still water is 25 km/h.

This is a fundamental property of meshed gears. - Therefore, if we start with the first gear rotating in a particular direction (say clockwise), the second gear must rotate counter-clockwise. - Continuing this pattern: - The third gear will rotate clockwise, - The fourth gear will rotate counter-clockwise, and so on. 3. **Establishing Rotation Patterns**: - Let's denote the direction of rotation: (C) for clockwise and (CC) for counterclockwise. - Starting from gear 1, we have: - Gear 1: (C) - Gear 2: (CC) - Gear 3: (C) - Gear 4: (CC) - Gear 5: (C) - Gear 6: (CC) - Gear 7: (C) - Gear 8: (CC) - Gear 9: (C) - Gear 10: (CC) - Gear 11: (C) 4. **Identifying the Contradiction**: - Notice that Gear 11, according to our pattern, should rotate clockwise (same as Gear 1). - However, because Gear 11 is also meshed with Gear 1, it must rotate in the opposite direction to Gear 1 (counter-clockwise). 5. **Conclusion**: - These contradictory requirements (Gear 1 and Gear 11 should both rotate clockwise but also rotate in opposite directions to each other) indicate an inconsistency. - Thus, it is impossible for all 11 gears to rotate simultaneously because the conditions of meshing gears (rotating in opposite directions) and the closed loop cause a contradiction.

We will use induction on ( n ). 1. **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), the graph ( G ) has ( 2 cdot 1 = 2 ) vertices and ( 1^2 + 1 = 2 ) edges. This is not possible since a simple graph with 2 vertices can have at most 1 edge. Therefore, the base case is trivially true. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for ( n = k ). That is, any simple graph with ( 2k ) vertices and ( k^2 + 1 ) edges contains two triangles sharing a common edge. We need to show that the statement holds for ( n = k + 1 ).

In this case: [ |E(G')| = (k+1)^2 + 1 - (2k + 2) = k^2 ] To avoid two triangles sharing a common edge, there must be exactly one vertex ( x ) in ( G' ) that is incident to both ( v ) and ( u ). Define the sets: [ A = {a in V(G') mid av in E(G), au notin E(G)} ] [ B = {b in V(G') mid av notin E(G), au in E(G)} ] Since ( |A| + |B| = 2k - 1 ), there are at most ( |A||B| leq k(k-1) ) edges between ( A ) and ( B ).

If a worker can dig a pit in time ( T ), then in a third of this time, each worker digs (frac{1}{3} T_i). 5. **Work Calculation with Turns:** Every turn involves two workers working to dig half a pit while the third worker works on the main pit. Therefore, the collective result after the pit is dug without resting is: - (2) halves, which together equate to: (2 times frac{1}{2} = 1) pit. - And the main pit task adds another whole pit: (1) pit. So, the effective rate when taking turns is (1) main pit plus (1) more pit (due to two secondary pits being jointly worked): [ text{Rate when taking turns} = 1 + 1 = 2 ] 6. **Work Calculation Simultaneously**: When working simultaneously, the combined effort of all three workers will produce a greater amount of work: - Since when taking turns, in designated turns, two workers will have managed to create (0.5 times 3 = 1.5) extra pits. - Hence, jointly, they do (1 main + 1.5 additional): [ text{Rate when together} = 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 ] 7. **Comparison**: Comparing the rates: [ frac{text{Rate when together}}{text{Rate when taking turns}} = frac{2.5}{1} ] Thus, the collective effort working simultaneously yields: [ = 2.5 ] # Conclusion The three workers will dig the same pit (2.5) times faster when working simultaneously compared to when they work one after another: [ boxed{2.5} ]"},{"prompt":"Robin Hood took seven wealthy men captive and demanded a ransom.

Robin Hood has captured seven rich men, and each has a servant who brought a gold purse.

The sequence of visits to the tent does not change on retries, and getting the next purse takes the same amount of time for all. 3. Given at the end, there are either 28 or 27 purses on the table, we need to determine which position the servant of the last released rich man originally held in line.

For ( N = 7 ): [ begin{aligned} text{Total purses} &= 7 + frac{6 times 7}{2} &= 7 + 21 &= 28 end{aligned} ] So, Robin Hood will collect exactly 28 purses if every trial fails except for the initial successful ones for each subsequent servant. Hence, in this case, the last servant, which brings the 28th purse, corresponds to the seventh servant. (boxed{text{seventh}}) Part (b): 27 purses - In the case where 27 purses are collected: 1.

Let: - ( K_{text{r}} ) be the number of knights now sitting on red chairs, - ( L_{text{b}} ) be the number of liars now sitting on blue chairs.

The knights sitting on red chairs (( K_{text{r}} )) must be telling the truth, and the liars sitting on blue chairs (( L_{text{b}} )) must be lying and thus were originally sitting on red chairs but claim to be on blue chairs now. Therefore: [ K_{text{r}} + L_{text{b}} = 10 ] Also, based on the initial conditions: [ K_{text{r}} = L - L_{text{b}} ] Since ( L ) liars have exchanged places with ( K ) knights, the number of knights who originally sat on blue chairs but now on red is equal to the number of liars who originally sat on red chairs but now on blue chairs. Let ( K_{text{new}} = K ) represent the knights who are newly seated such that: [ K_{text{new}} = L_{text{b}} ] With ( K_{text{new}} + K_{text{r}} = K ), we get: [ K_{text{r}} = K_{text{new}} + (K - K_{text{new}}) ] [ K_{text{r}} = 10 ] (since ( K_{text{new}} = L_{text{b}} )). Thus, The number of knights sitting on the red chairs matches the number of liars currently on blue chairs, simplified to: [ K_{text{r}} = L - 5 ] Thus, ( K_{text{new}} - K_{text{r}} = 5 ).

Thus, for ( n ) cells, the total number of sides counted would be ( 4n ). - Internal segments are shared by adjacent cells, so they are counted twice initially. 2. **Relating Sides and Perimeter to Internal Segments:** - Let's denote the number of internal segments by ( I ). - The total number of sides in the grid cells is first counted as ( 4S ) (each cell counted with 4 sides). - Each internal segment is counted twice, and each perimeter segment is counted once. - Hence, the equation connecting these quantities is: [ 4S = 2I + P ] - Given that ( S = 300 ) and ( P = 300 ), we can substitute these values into the equation: [ 4 times 300 = 2I + 300 ] 3. **Solving for Internal Segments ( I ):** [ 1200 = 2I + 300 ] [ 1200 - 300 = 2I ] [ 900 = 2I ] [ I = 450 ] 4. **Considering the Color Pattern and Cell Distribution:** - In a chessboard-style coloring of the grid, boundary cells (those that contribute to the perimeter) will alternate between two colors (black and white). - If the boundary cells happen to be all of one color (say black), then all white cells would be internal. 5. **Examining the Implication:** - If all boundary cells are black, internal segments include the sides that form the boundaries around white cells. - The number of internal segments must also account for any portions of the perimeter not shared by internal cells. 6. **Contradiction with Assumption:** - Since for each black cell on the boundary, each white cell shares an internal boundary, there's a necessary balance. - Given the counting above, if all boundary cells are considered black or chosen uniformly, the structure cannot maintain the perimeter length without creating at least one boundary segment longer than 1. 7. **Conclusion:** - The provided attempt to maintain uniform perimeter alongside uniform length for all segments leads to an over-provision of counted internal sides. - Thus, it is inevitable that at least one segment of the boundary will exceed the length 1, as the logistical structure of the enclosing polygon does not suffice with unit-length segments exclusively.

Therefore, the vertex of C_{2} is shifted to (1+3, -3) = (4, -3). This means the axis of symmetry of C_{2} is the vertical line through its vertex, i.e., x=4. 3. **Find the Line of Symmetry Between C_{1} and C_{2}:** The line of symmetry that C_{1} and C_{2} are symmetric about would be exactly midway between their axes of symmetry.

What was the distance from his starting point to the turning point?","completion":"To find the distance from the starting point to the turning point, we need to know the total distance traveled by the boy and then divide it by the number of round trips he made. First, let's find the total distance traveled by the boy. Since he was biking at a speed of 1.75 kilometers per hour and he biked for 30 minutes, we need to convert the time into hours to match the units of speed. 30 minutes is equal to 0.5 hours (since 1 hour = 60 minutes). Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled by multiplying the speed by the time: Total distance = Speed × Time Total distance = 1.75 km/hour × 0.5 hour Total distance = 0.875 kilometers This is the distance he traveled in one direction (either from the starting point to the turning point or from the turning point back to the starting point). Since he made 5 round trips, the total distance he traveled would be 5 times this distance. Total round trip distance = 0.875 km × 5 Total round trip distance = 4.375 kilometers Each round trip consists of two halves: going from the starting point to the turning point and then returning.

Therefore, (60 mid abc). 2. Now we consider (dfrac{n}{d_{22}} = d_{k-21}). 3. So, we have (d_7^2 + d_{10}^2 = d_{k-21}^2). This implies (60 mid (d_7)(d_{10})(d_{k-21})). 4.

Now, let's find the total number of calls processed by both teams: Total calls = Calls by team A + Calls by team B Total calls = A * (6/5)C + B * C Total calls = (5/8)B * (6/5)C + B * C (since A = (5/8)B) Total calls = (6/8)BC + BC Total calls = (3/4)BC + BC Total calls = (3/4)BC + (4/4)BC Total calls = (3/4 + 4/4)BC Total calls = (7/4)BC Now, we want to find the fraction of the total calls processed by team B: Fraction of calls by team B = (B * C) / Total calls Fraction of calls by team B = (B * C) / (7/4)BC Fraction of calls by team B = 1 / (7/4) Fraction of calls by team B = 4/7 So, team B processed boxed{4/7} of the total calls."},{"prompt":"Which of the following calculations is correct?

If B wants to invest in an equally good 10% stock, he must purchase a stock worth 120. What is the percentage of the stock A invested in?","completion":"To find the percentage of the stock A invested in, we need to compare the investments of A and B in terms of their yields. Let's assume A invested in an x% stock. Since A bought the stock at 96, for every 96 invested, A would receive x% of 100 (the face value) as a dividend. So, the annual income from A's investment is: Income_A = (x/100) * 100 = x Now, let's consider B's investment. B wants to invest in a 10% stock, which means for every 100 of face value, B would receive 10% of 100 as a dividend. However, B must purchase the stock at 120. So, the annual income from B's investment is: Income_B = (10/100) * 100 = 10 But B has to invest 120 to get that 10, so the actual yield (return on investment) for B is: Yield_B = (10 / 120) * 100 = 8.33% Since A and B want to invest in equally good stocks, the yields should be the same. Therefore, the yield of A's investment (Yield_A) should be equal to the yield of B's investment (Yield_B). Yield_A = Yield_B (x / 96) * 100 = 8.33% Now, we can solve for x: x = (8.33% * 96) / 100 x = 0.0833 * 96 x = 7.9968 Since x represents the percentage of the stock A invested in, we can round it to two decimal places: x ≈ 8% Therefore, the percentage of the stock A invested in is approximately boxed{8%} ."},{"prompt":"The graph of the function y=log_{2}(x1) is denoted as C.

Let ( O ) be the center of the sphere, ( A ) one of the vertices of the lower base, and ( A_1 ) one of the vertices of the upper base directly above ( A ). 2. The angle ( angle OAA_1 = 60^circ ). Consequently, ( angle OO_1A_1 = 30^circ ) where ( O_1 ) is the midpoint of the vertical height of the truncated pyramid, which simplifies our diagrams (refer to the figure above). 3. Since ( triangle OAA_1 ) is a 30-60-90 triangle: - ( A_1O_1 = frac{1}{2}A_1O = frac{R}{2} ) - ( OO_1 = frac{R sqrt{3}}{2} ) 4. The area of the lower base, which is a regular hexagon with circumradius ( R ), is calculated using the formula for the area of a regular hexagon: [ S_{text{нижн } text{осн}} = 6 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{4} R^2 = frac{3 R^2 sqrt{3}}{2} ] 5. The area of the upper base is one-fourth of that of the lower base because of the similarity of the two hexagons. Hence, [ S_{text{верхн .осн}} = frac{1}{4} S_{text{нижн } text{осн}} = frac{3 R^2 sqrt{3}}{8} ] 6. The volume of a truncated pyramid with lower base area ( S_1 ), upper base area ( S_2 ), and height ( h ) is given by the formula: [ V = frac{1}{3} h (S_1 + S_2 + sqrt{S_1 S_2}) ] Here, the height ( h ) of the truncated pyramid is ( OO_1 = frac{R sqrt{3}}{2} ). 7.

Louie has to make 3 equal monthly payments, which we'll call ( M ), and we're given that ( M ) is approximately 402. The formula for the monthly payment on a compound interest loan is derived from the present value of an annuity formula: [ M = frac{P cdot frac{r}{(1-(1+r)^{-n})}} ] Where: - ( M ) is the monthly payment - ( P ) is the principal amount (the original loan amount) - ( r ) is the monthly interest rate - ( n ) is the number of payments In this case, ( n = 3 ) (since there are 3 payments), and ( r = 0.10 ).

Prove that the diagonals are perpendicular and intersect at their midpoints: - Since (ABC) is a rhombus, its diagonals are perpendicular and intersect each other at their midpoints. - Therefore, (AC perp BD) and (O) is the midpoint of both (AC) and (BD). 3. Show that (M, N, K, L) lies at the vertices of a square: - In the rhombus (ABC), triangle (AOB) and triangle (COD) are symmetric about point (O), as are triangle (BOC) and triangle (AOD). 4. Prove the relationship between the segments: - Since (M, N, K,) and (L) are points where the angle bisectors intersect the sides of their respective triangles, use the Angle Bisector Theorem: [ frac{BM}{MO} = frac{AB}{AO} = frac{BO}{OD} = frac{CN}{NO} ] Similarly, for other segments: [ frac{DK}{KO} = frac{DA}{AO}, quad frac{AL}{LO} = frac{AD}{DO} ] - We see that (MOK) and (NOL) are perpendicular bisectors intersecting at (O). 5.

Compute f'(x) with the discovered coefficients: f'(x) = 12x^2 - 6x - 18. Find critical points by solving f'(x) = 0: 12x^2 - 6x - 18 = 0. Dividing by 6, we get: 2x^2 - x - 3 = 0. Factoring the quadratic: (2x + 3)(x - 1) = 0. Thus, x=-frac{3}{2} or x=1. Since x=1 is at the boundary of our interval, we only consider x=-frac{3}{2} as an interior critical point.

Consider the statements made by each inhabitant: - Each inhabitant claims that all their fellow villagers are liars. 3. Analyze the logical implications of these statements: - If there are at least two knights in any village, then a knight would be lying by saying the other knight is a liar, which contradicts the knight's nature of always telling the truth. Therefore, there can't be two knights in any village. - If all inhabitants in a village were liars, then they would be telling the truth by stating that all others are liars, which again contradicts their nature of always lying.

We compute: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} frac{x_i^2}{x_{i+1}} = sum_{i=0}^{n} frac{left( frac{1}{2^i} right)^2}{frac{1}{2^{i+1}}} = sum_{i=0}^{n} frac{frac{1}{4^i}}{frac{1}{2^{i+1}}} = sum_{i=0}^{n} frac{1/4^i}{1/2^{i+1}} = sum_{i=0}^{n} 2^{i-1} ] Simplifying this: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} 2^{i-1} = frac{2^n - 1}{2-1} = 2^n - 1 ] 4. To refine, this suggests considering: [ sum_{i=0}^{n} frac{left( frac{1}{2^i} right)^2}{frac{1}{2^{i+1}}} = 2 + 2^{n-1} - frac{1}{2^{n}} leq 4 ] For reasonably large ( n ), (sum_{i=0}^{n} frac{x_i^2}{x_{i+1}} approx 4 ). 5. Thus, the smallest constant ( c ) satisfying (sum_{i=0}^{n} frac{x_i^2}{x_{i+1}} leq c) for this specific sequence and all ( n geq 0 ) must be at least 4.

How much start can A give B in a kilometer race?","completion":"Let's denote the speeds of A, B, and C as Va, Vb, and Vc respectively, and the time it takes each of them to complete the race as Ta, Tb, and Tc respectively. Since A can give C a 300 meters start, it means that A covers 1000 meters in the same time C covers 700 meters. Therefore, we can write the following equation based on their speeds and times: Va * Ta = 1000 Vc * Tc = 700 Since they finish at the same time, Ta = Tc. Therefore, we can say that Va/Vc = 1000/700 = 10/7. Similarly, B can give C a 176.47 meters start, which means B covers 1000 meters in the same time C covers 1000 - 176.47 = 823.53 meters. So we can write: Vb * Tb = 1000 Vc * Tc = 823.53 Since Tb = Tc, we can say that Vb/Vc = 1000/823.53. Now, we need to find out how much start A can give B. Since Va/Vc = 10/7 and Vb/Vc = 1000/823.53, we can find the ratio of Va to Vb by dividing the two ratios: (Va/Vc) / (Vb/Vc) = (10/7) / (1000/823.53) = (10/7) * (823.53/1000) = 8235.3/7000 = 1.17647 This means that A is 1.17647 times faster than B. If A runs 1000 meters, B runs 1000/1.17647 meters in the same time. Let's calculate the distance B would cover when A covers 1000 meters: Distance covered by B = 1000 / 1.17647 ≈ 850 meters Therefore, A can give B a start of 1000 - 850 = boxed{150} meters in a kilometer race."},{"prompt":"Phillip's mother asked him to go to the supermarket to buy some things and gave him 95, so he spent 14 on oranges, 25 on apples and 6 on candy.

To find numbers at most 90 that are relatively prime to 20, we work with the formula: 20 = 2^2 cdot 5. We use the formula for Euler's totient function, phi(n), to find numbers relatively prime to 20: - Total numbers divisible by 2 are 90/2 = 45, - Total numbers divisible by 5 are 90/5 = 18. To use the inclusion-exclusion principle for numbers divisible by 2^2 = 4 (since 2^2 includes those divisible by 2), we get 90/4 = 22.5 (rounded down to 22). Thus, using this inclusion-exclusion principle: - Initially subtract those divisible by 4 and 5, totally subtracting 22 + 18 = 40. - Numbers divisible by both 4 and 5 (i.e., 20) are added back: 90/20 = 4.5 (rounded down to 4).

First year savings from allowance = 50/week * 52 weeks = 2600 In the second year, Thomas worked at a coffee shop and earned 9 per hour for 30 hours a week. Second year earnings from the job = 9/hour * 30 hours/week * 52 weeks = 14040 The total amount Thomas has saved over the two years is the sum of his first year savings and his second year earnings. Total savings = First year savings + Second year earnings Total savings = 2600 + 14040 = 16640 Thomas needs 2000 more to buy the car, which means the total cost of the car is 16640 + 2000 = 18640.

Since he spent this amount over two years, which is 104 weeks (52 weeks/year * 2 years), we divide the total amount spent by the number of weeks.

We know that each vampire turns 5 more people into vampires every night. On the first night, the two original vampires will turn 5 people each into vampires, so there will be 5 * 2 = 10 new vampires. Therefore, at the end of the first night, there will be V0 + 10 vampires in total. On the second night, all of these vampires (V0 + 10) will each turn 5 more people into vampires. So, the number of new vampires created on the second night will be 5 * (V0 + 10). We are given that there are 72 vampires after two nights. This means that: V0 + 10 + 5 * (V0 + 10) = 72 Let's solve for V0: V0 + 10 + 5V0 + 50 = 72 6V0 + 60 = 72 6V0 = 72 - 60 6V0 = 12 V0 = 12 / 6 V0 = 2 This confirms that the initial number of vampires (V0) is indeed 2, as stated in the problem. Now, let's calculate the initial population of the village (P). We know that after the first night, 10 humans were turned into vampires, reducing the human population by 10. After the second night, the remaining humans were reduced by 5 * (V0 + 10), which is 5 * (2 + 10) = 5 * 12 = 60. So, the total number of humans turned into vampires over the two nights is 10 (from the first night) + 60 (from the second night) = 70. Since there are 72 vampires after two nights, and we know that 70 of them were humans before, the initial population of the village must have been: P = 70 (humans turned into vampires) + 2 (original vampires) P = 72 Therefore, the population of the village was boxed{72} before the vampires arrived."},{"prompt":"From a point ( M ) on the ellipse (frac{x^{2}}{9}+frac{y^{2}}{4}=1), two tangent lines are drawn to the circle with the minor axis of the ellipse as its diameter.

This configuration is unique under the given conditions. Step 2: Construction of the Triangle Given angle (alpha), construct an arbitrary segment (AC) on one side of (alpha). Drop a perpendicular from (C) onto the other side of the angle, labeling the foot as (H). Let the intersection of the perpendicular with the angle bisector of (A) be called (O). The point (B) is determined as the intersection of the second side of the angle with the line (OM), where (M) is the midpoint of segment (AC). This uniquely defines triangle (ABC). It is evident that the constructed triangle has an acute angle (B) since (H) on side (AB) implies (angle B) is acute. Step 3: Angular Analysis We need to prove that if (alpha < frac{pi}{4}), then (angle ACB > frac{pi}{2}). 1. Extend (AH) on line (AB) by segment (HB_1 = AH). 2.

Let's assume ( m > n ) without loss of generality. We can rewrite the expression as: [ 4^{m} - 4^{n} = 4^{n} left( 4^{m-n} - 1 right) ] For ( 4^{m} - 4^{n} ) to be divisible by ( 3^{k+1} ), ( 4^{m-n} - 1 ) must be divisible by ( 3^{k+1} ). We will prove this statement using induction on ( k ). # Base Case ( ( k = 1 ) ): We need to show that ( 4^{a} - 1 ) is divisible by ( 3^{2} = 9 ) when ( a ) is divisible by ( 3 ), but not divisible by ( 27 ). Consider ( a = 3 ): [ 4^3 - 1 = 64 - 1 = 63 ] Since ( 63 = 9 times 7 ), ( 4^3 - 1 ) is divisible by ( 9 ). Additionally, [ 63 div 27 = 2 + frac{9}{27} ] indicates that ( 63 ) is not divisible by ( 27 ).

Therefore, [ 4^{b} equiv 4^r pmod{3^{k+1}} ] For ( 4^{b} - 1 ) to be divisible by ( 3^{k+2} ), it must be that ( r = 0 ) considering the residual modulo properties. Hence, [ b = 3^{k+1} c ] [ 4^{b} - 1 = 4^{3^{k+1} c} - 1 ] Using the inductive hypothesis and properties of exponents, it follows: [ 4^{3^{k+1} c} - 1 = left( 4^{3^{k+1}} - 1 right) left( 4^{3^{k+1}(c-1)} + 4^{3^{k+1}(c-2)} + cdots + 1 right) ] By the induction hypothesis, [ 4^{3^{k+1}} - 1 text{ is divisible by } 3^{k+2} ] Finally, since [ 4^{3^{k+1}} - 1 text{ is divisible by } 3^{k+2}] [ 4^{3^{k+1}} - 1 text{ is not divisible by } 3^{k+3}] Therefore, the minimal ( b ) such that ( 4^{b} - 1 ) is divisible by ( 3^{k+2} ) is indeed ( b = 3^{k+1} ).

Since triangles ADP and QAB are similar, all corresponding angles of these triangles are equal. The common vertex angle at A, implies two possible angle comparisons: either angle ABQ = angle ADP quad text{and} quad angle AQB = angle APD, or angle ABQ = angle APD quad text{and} quad angle AQB = angle ADP. **2.

Substituting the values of a^2 and b^2, we obtain c^2 = 4 + 12 = 16. 3. Taking the square root of both sides, we get c = sqrt{16} = 4. Now, the coordinates of the foci for a horizontal hyperbola of the form frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 are given by (pm c, 0). So the coordinates of the foci of the hyperbola are (pm 4, 0).

We need to prove the following: [ AB cdot A'B' = BC cdot B'C' + AC cdot A'C' ] Here is the solution step-by-step: 1. **Constructing a quadrilateral**: - Create an isosceles trapezoid BCAC'' such that {BC''} || {CA} . - This implies B, C, A, C'' are concyclic, as they form a cyclic quadrilateral. 2. **Application of Ptolemy's Theorem**: - Since B, C, A, C'' form a cyclic quadrilateral, we can apply Ptolemy's Theorem: [ AB cdot C'' = AC cdot BC'' + BC cdot AC'' ] 3. **Triangles similarity**: - Observe the similarity between triangle ABC'' and triangle B'A'C': [ triangle ABC'' sim triangle B'A'C' ] - Set the corresponding sides in proportion: [ frac{AB}{A'B'} = frac{AC''}{B'C'} = frac{BC''}{A'C'} = k ] where k is the proportionality constant. 4. **Simplification**: - Let OC'' = AB. Substituting it back into Ptolemy's theorem: [ AB cdot OC'' = AC cdot BC'' + BC cdot AC'' ] - Since OC'' = AB, hence: [ AB cdot AB = AC cdot BC'' + BC cdot AC'' ] - Further using the similarity ratios and substituting triangle ABC'' sim triangle B'A'C': [ frac{AB}{A'B'} = frac{AC''}{B'C'} = frac{BC''}{A'C'} ] - Therefore, in proportional values: [ BC'' = k cdot A'C', quad AC'' = k cdot B'C' ] - Substituting these ratios in: [ AB cdot AB = AC cdot (k cdot A'C') + BC cdot (k cdot B'C') ] - Given the inverse relationship of sides: [ AB cdot A'B' = AC cdot A'C' + BC cdot B'C' ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{AB cdot A'B' = BC cdot B'C' + AC cdot A'C'} ]"},{"prompt":"A and B are playing a game of table tennis, and the score is tied at 14:14.
