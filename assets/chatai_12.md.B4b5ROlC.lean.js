How much does healthcare software development cost? Is developing a customized medical ERP system worth it?","completion":"**How to build a custom ERP solution for your medical organization?** 1. **Identify Organizational Needs:** Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of your organization's requirements. This includes the different departments like administration, HR, finance, procurement, patient management, and healthcare services that need to be integrated into the ERP system. 2. **Regulatory Compliance:** Understand and document all the relevant healthcare regulations such as HIPAA in the U.S., GDPR in the EU, or other local healthcare laws that your system must comply with. 3. **Assemble a Project Team:** Create a cross-functional team with IT specialists, healthcare professionals, and management staff to oversee the project. 4. **Choose Technology and Partners:** Decide on the technology stack and whether to build in-house or outsource. For outsourcing, research and select a reputable vendor experienced in healthcare software development. 5. **Process Mapping and Customization:** Map existing processes and work with stakeholders to design the customized workflows that the ERP system will support. 6. **Data Management Strategy:** Develop a plan for data handling, storage, and migration, ensuring data security, privacy, and integrity. 7. **Develop and Implement:** Follow an agile development process, allowing for iterative testing and feedback. Begin with building the core modules and then expand to other functionalities. 8. **Testing and Training:** Rigorously test the system for bugs, security vulnerabilities, and compliance breaches. Train the end-users with an emphasis on how the new system changes their workflow. 9. **Go Live and Ongoing Support:** Move the system into production with a go-live date and ensure you have support in place for addressing any immediate issues. 10. **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review system performance, collect user feedback, and make the necessary adjustments or upgrades. **How much does healthcare software development cost?** Healthcare software development costs can vary widely depending on several factors, including: - The size and complexity of the project - Custom features and integrations - Security and compliance requirements - The geographical location of the development team - Whether the development is in-house or outsourced You could be looking at anywhere from tens of thousands to several million dollars. Basic applications may start at 50,000 to 100,000, while complex systems with advanced analytics, AI, or extensive database management can go well over 500,000. It's best to get detailed quotes from several vendors or consultants based on your specific needs for a more accurate estimate. **Is developing a customized medical ERP system worth it?** Developing a custom medical ERP system can be worth it if: - Off-the-shelf solutions can't meet the unique needs of your organization. - Your organization can afford the initial development and ongoing maintenance costs. - You require advanced integrations with existing healthcare systems or medical devices. - You need high levels of customization for workflows, compliance, or patient management. - The return on investment, in terms of efficiency gains, improved patient care, and reduced errors, justifies the expense. However, it's crucial to conduct a cost-benefit analysis before embarking on such a project, considering both the tangible and intangible benefits it may provide. Custom ERP systems can lead to long-term savings and improved healthcare outcomes, but they come with significant costs and risks, which need to be carefully weighed."},{"prompt":"prosmarketplace.com is the site we need to create shor social media post for thi siste on based on employee and worker","completion":"Sure, here's a sample social media post promoting prosMarketplace.com focused on the platform's benefits for employees and workers: --- 🔍 Seeking talented professionals or hunting for the job of your dreams?

It involves multiple libraries, such as \`moviepy\`, \`subprocess\`, \`numpy\`, \`uuid\`, and \`scipy.io.wavfile\`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the script works: 1. Import all necessary modules and set up necessary lists, such as \`temporary_audio_files\`, and parameters like \`video_extensions\` and the \`output_folder\`. 2. Define the function \`calculate_loudness\`, which calculates the loudness of audio data. It uses a simple root mean square (RMS) calculation over the audio samples, handling both mono and stereo audio. 3. Define the function \`find_loudest_moments\`, which reads an audio file, computes the volume using \`calculate_loudness\` and identifies the loudest segments. It avoids segments too close to the beginning or end of the video, and it ensures that each selected moment doesn't overlap with previously selected moments. It returns a list of timestamps corresponding to these moments. 4. Define \`extract_segments\`, a function that uses \`ffmpeg\` to extract specific segments from the video based on the previously detected loud moments. The segments are saved in the \`output_folder\`. 5. \`process_video_files\` walks through the current directory (or a provided directory structure) and finds all video files that match the defined video file extensions. For each video file found, it: - Generates a temporary audio WAV file from the video by extracting the audio using \`moviepy\`. - Runs \`find_loudest_moments\` to detect the loudest segments. - Calls \`extract_segments\` to create separate video files for each selected moment. - Cleans up the temporary audio file. 6. Finally, \`if __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\` serves as the entry point when the script is executed as a standalone file. It prompts the user for the number of seconds to ignore at the beginning and ending, as well as how many moments to extract and their duration. 7. After the script processes all video files, it cleans up the temporary WAV files used during processing. Do note that this script uses \`subprocess.run\` to call \`ffmpeg\`, which means \`ffmpeg\` should be installed and available in your system's PATH for the script to work correctly. Additionally, error handling, particularly around \`subprocess.run\`, should be robust to handle any issues that may arise during the extraction process. Also, I noticed that there is a comment indicating \\"Now pass video_duration\\", which implies that the \`video_duration\` was added to the \`extract_segments\` function, but it was already a parameter being passed to it. You can remove that comment since it's not adding any new information to the code. Make sure that the environment where you're running this script has all the required libraries installed, and that you have the necessary permissions to read and write files in your respective directories."},{"prompt":"Je voudrais modifier le script : il faudrait inverser les moments où le script demande à l'utilisateur le nombre de moments avec la demande de la durée de ces moments.","completion":"Pour inverser l'ordre des inputs demandés à l'utilisateur concernant le nombre de moments et la durée de ces moments, vous pouvez simplement inverser l'ordre des appels à \`input()\` dans la portion \`if __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\` du script.

Here is a possible way to sort the moments by their timestamp (assuming that's what you meant by \\"sorting\\"): After finding the moments, sort them: \`\`\`python moments = find_loudest_moments(audio_path, num_moments, segment_duration, video_duration, starting_offset_seconds, ending_offset_seconds) moments.sort() # Sort the moments in ascending order based on their timestamps \`\`\` This way, when you iterate over \`moments\` to create the output filenames, the segments will be named in ascending order based on where they occurred in the original video. Regarding the function \`process_video_files\`, it is currently overwritten by a later definition which processes individual files. If you wish to separate the logic for getting video durations and for processing individual video files, you should remove the duplicated traversal loop from the second definition of \`process_video_files\` and ensure that it only processes the single video file provided by its \`video_path\` parameter. The current double definition and usage of \`process_video_files\` would cause confusion and errors. It should be cleaned up, keeping only the iteration and the \`process_video_files\` call within the \`if __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\` block, and ensure that the function \`process_video_files\` only processes the given \`video_path\`."},{"prompt":"Peux-t-on ajouter une fonctionnalité en fin de script ?

Cependant, il semble également que le script ne liste et ne traite aucun fichier vidéo, car il arrive directement aux messages de fin. Cela peut être dû au fait que la fonction \`get_video_durations\` ne trouve pas de fichiers vidéo correspondant aux extensions définies dans \`video_extensions\`. Cela peut arriver pour plusieurs raisons : 1. Il n'y a pas de fichiers vidéo dans le dossier courant ou les sous-dossiers (en fonction du choix de l'utilisateur d'inclure les sous-dossiers ou non). 2. Les fichiers vidéo n'ont pas les extensions de fichier correspondantes (\`.mp4\`, \`.mkv\`, \`.wmv\`, \`.avi\`). 3. Il pourrait y avoir une erreur dans la logique du script empêchant la détection des fichiers vidéo. Pour diagnostiquer et corriger le problème, vous pouvez ajouter des messages de débogage pour comprendre où le script pourrait échouer. Par exemple : 1. Ajoutez un print statement dans \`get_video_durations\` pour voir si des fichiers vidéo sont détectés. \`\`\`python def get_video_durations(include_subfolders): video_durations = {} for root, dirs, files in os.walk('.', topdown=True): if not include_subfolders: dirs[:] = [] # Empêche os.walk de parcourir plus loin for file in files: if file.lower().endswith(tuple(video_extensions)): print(f\\"Video file detected: {file}\\") # Ajouter ceci pour le débogage video_path = os.path.join(root, file) # ... \`\`\` 2. Vérifiez que les chemins des fichiers sont corrects et accessibles en ajoutant des print statements appropriés. Enfin, il y a une incohérence dans la définition de la fonction \`process_video_files\` ; elle ne semble être utilisée nulle part ailleurs dans le script. Sa logique semble être incorporée directement dans la boucle \`for\` dans le bloc \`if __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\`, ce qui est probablement l'intention voulu pour le script. Vous devriez supprimer \`process_video_files\` pour éviter la confusion. 3. Vous devez vous assurer que les dossiers et fichiers existent réellement et se trouvent au bon emplacement par rapport à l'endroit où le script est exécuté. Utilisez des chemins absolus si nécessaire pour éviter les erreurs liées aux chemins relatifs. 4. Assurez-vous que la fonction \`ask_sorting_preference\` renvoie un entier que la fonction \`sort_moments\` peut utiliser correctement. Actuellement, elle renvoie le choix en tant que \`int\`, ce qui est correct, mais vous devriez gérer les cas où l'utilisateur entre une valeur invalide. En ajoutant des messages de débogage et en vérifiant l'intégrité des chemins de fichiers, vous devriez être capable de déterminer pourquoi les vidéos ne sont pas traitées et corriger le problème en conséquence."},{"prompt":"Peut-on demander au script de détecter la présence de musique ?","completion":"La détection automatique de musique dans les fichiers vidéo est une tâche complexe qui dépasse généralement la portée des scripts Python simples. Elle nécessite l'analyse des caractéristiques acoustiques de l'audio et souvent l'utilisation de l'apprentissage automatique ou de bibliothèques spécialisées pour distinguer la musique des autres types de sons. Cependant, il existe des outils de ligne de commande tels que \`ffmpeg\` et \`audfprint\`, ainsi que des bibliothèques Python telles que \`librosa\`, \`pyAudioAnalysis\`, et \`dejavu\` qui peuvent être utilisés pour tenter de détecter la musique par une analyse acoustique ou la correspondance avec une base de données de musiques connues. Pour une approche basique, vous pourriez essayer d'analyser certains indicateurs comme la régularité du rythme, la présence de gammes harmoniques typiques de la musique ou les niveaux de volume et d'énergie dans des bandes de fréquences spécifiques qui correspondent souvent à la musique. Mais gardez à l'esprit que ces méthodes peuvent donner de faux positifs et de faux négatifs, car elles ne sont pas infaillibles. Si vous souhaitez intégrer une fonctionnalité de détection de musique dans votre script, voici une approche générale en utilisant \`librosa\`, qui est une bibliothèque Python pour l'analyse musicale et audio : 1. Commencez par installer \`librosa\` si ce n'est pas déjà fait : \`\`\` pip install librosa \`\`\` 2. Ensuite, dans votre script, vous pourriez ajouter une fonction pour analyser l'audio et tenter de détecter la présence de musique : \`\`\`python import librosa import numpy as np def detect_music(audio_path, sr=44100): y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, sr=sr) # Exemple d'indicateurs simples que vous pourriez analyser : tempo, beats = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=y, sr=sr) spectral_centroids = librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y=y, sr=sr) avg_centroid = np.mean(spectral_centroids) # Vous pouvez définir des seuils pour ces indicateurs afin de décider si c'est probablement de la musique is_music = tempo > 60 and tempo < 180 and avg_centroid > seuil_centroid return is_music \`\`\` 3. Vous pouvez ensuite appeler cette fonction pour chaque fichier audio que vous extrayez de vos vidéos. Gardez à l'esprit que cette fonction \`detect_music\` est extrêmement rudimentaire et vous devrez probablement peaufiner et valider son exactitude avec un ensemble de données test. Les indicateurs et seuils utilisés sont purement illustratifs. Pour des analyses plus avancées ou précises, envisagez d'utiliser des outils spécialisés ou des services avec des modèles de machine learning entraînés pour la détection de musique."},{"prompt":"Error processing video .client_filesf1414d70a2955ff1eb2b387b288b1a2b34a6b602947e247842094e5c16b76475f6c_clip5TEMP_MPY_wvf_snd.mp4: 'video_fps' Error processing video .client_filesf2020625f90a1c481235f3b660489e4bfc6720a6876b22fb0846bfc6aa608174b06_clip1TEMP_MPY_wvf_snd.mp4: 'video_fps' Error processing video .client_filesf2a2a29156bdbc426f4765c230825b583af4e5a18243a32cf964ac605d81bd58212_clip13TEMP_MPY_wvf_snd.mp4: 'video_fps' Error processing video .client_filesf6161146e99e94af8e39229b853e1e73d0c21e8847446ebccb75db15328e75c5e12.mkv: MoviePy error: failed to read the duration of file .client_filesf6161146e99e94af8e39229b853e1e73d0c21e8847446ebccb75db15328e75c5e12.mkv.

Pour gérer ces erreurs, vous pouvez employer plusieurs stratégies de dépannage et d'exception handling : # Stratégie 1: Validation des fichiers avant traitement Avant d'essayer de traiter un fichier vidéo, vérifiez qu'il peut être ouvert et que ses métadonnées telles que la durée de la vidéo et le taux de trame peuvent être extraites. Si vous rencontrez des erreurs pendant la lecture ou la récupération des métadonnées, vous pouvez alors choisir de sauter le fichier et de continuer avec les suivants. # Stratégie 2: Gestion des exceptions Utilisez des blocs d'exception handling \`try\`/\`except\` autour des appels MoviePy pour attraper spécifiquement les erreurs qui surviennent et décider de sauter le fichier ou d'entreprendre une autre action corrective. # Voici comment vous pourriez appliquer ces stratégies dans votre script : \`\`\`python from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip def get_video_durations(include_subfolders): video_durations = {} # Utilisez l'argument recursive pour contrôler si les sous-dossiers sont inclus for root, dirs, files in os.walk('.', topdown=True): # ... le reste de votre fonction ... for file in files: if file.lower().endswith(tuple(video_extensions)): video_path = os.path.join(root, file) try: video_clip = VideoFileClip(video_path) video_duration = video_clip.duration # Vérifiez que ceci ne lève pas une exception video_fps = video_clip.fps # Vérifiez aussi ceci video_durations[video_path] = video_duration video_clip.close() # Assurez-vous de fermer le clip except AttributeError as e: # Attrape spécifiquement l'erreur 'video_fps' print(f\\"Error processing video {video_path}: Metadata not found (fps).\\") except Exception as e: # Attrape toute autre erreur de MoviePy print(f\\"Error processing video {video_path}: {e}\\") return video_durations \`\`\` Cette modification garantira que votre script imprime un message d'erreur utile et passe au fichier vidéo suivant lorsqu'il rencontre un fichier vidéo qu'il ne peut pas traiter. # Informations supplémentaires sur le message d'erreur ffmpeg : D'après les informations retournées par ffmpeg, il semble que le fichier \`'61146e99e94af8e39229b853e1e73d0c21e8847446ebccb75db15328e75c5e12.mkv'\` n'a pas de valeur de durée (\`Duration: N/A\`).

Pour ce faire, vous pouvez ajouter une étape avant de commencer le traitement où vous récupérez ce nombre fixe d'extractions souhaitées. Ensuite, vous utiliserez cette valeur constante pour toutes les vidéos traitées. Voici comment vous pouvez modifier le script pour incorporer cette fonctionnalité : 1. Demandez à l'utilisateur le nombre d'extractions à effectuer pour chaque fichier vidéo : \`\`\`python if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": include_subfolders = ask_directory_preference() starting_offset_seconds = float(input(\\"Combien de secondes à ignorer au début pour l'analyse ? \\")) ending_offset_seconds = float(input(\\"Combien de secondes à ignorer à la fin pour l'analyse ? \\")) segment_duration = float(input(\\"Quelle est la durée (en secondes) de chaque segment vidéo à extraire ? \\")) num_moments = int(input(\\"Combien de moments forts souhaitez-vous extraire pour chaque vidéo ? \\")) # Ajoutez ceci video_durations = get_video_durations(include_subfolders) sorting_preference = ask_sorting_preference() \`\`\` 2. Utilisez ensuite cette valeur de \`num_moments\` constant pour toutes les vidéos traitées sans demander à l'utilisateur à chaque fois : \`\`\`python for video_path, duration in video_durations.items(): available_duration = max(duration - starting_offset_seconds - ending_offset_seconds, 0) # Ligne suivante commentée car \`num_moments\` est déjà défini au niveau du script. # num_moments = int(input(f\\"Combien de moments forts souhaiteriez-vous extraire de la vidéo '{video_path}' ? \\")) unique_id = str(uuid.uuid4()) audio_path = f'temp_audio_{unique_id}.wav' temporary_audio_files.append(audio_path) # Le reste du traitement reste inchangé... \`\`\` En utilisant cette approche, vous garantissez que le même nombre de moments forts (défini par \`num_moments\`) sera extrait de chaque fichier vidéo. Cependant, notez que vous devrez toujours prendre en compte la durée totale de la vidéo pour vous assurer qu'il est possible d'extraire le nombre souhaité de moments forts sans dépasser la durée de la vidéo. Pour les vidéos qui ne sont pas assez longues pour permettre l'extraction du nombre de segments défini, vous devrez décider de la marche à suivre (par exemple, soit ignorer la vidéo, soit extraire le nombre maximum possible de segments)."},{"prompt":"import os import subprocess import numpy as np import uuid #

Pour gérer ce type d'erreur, nous pouvons envelopper l'opération qui provoque l'erreur dans un bloc \`try...except\`.

Si le fichier vidéo est endommagé ou incomplet (ce qui pourrait être le cas des téléchargements interrompus ou des copies échouées), il peut être nécessaire de réparer ou de remplacer le fichier vidéo. En ce qui concerne l'erreur retournée par FFmpeg concernant le fichier MKV manquant de métadonnées de durée, cela pourrait suggérer que le fichier vidéo est corrompu ou mal encodé.

Slava, a 21-year-old guy from Lviv, Ukraine. He was taking a marshrutka home, it was route 21. Suddenly a flash, some unseen portal went off and he woke up in Chinatown, where the overlord Espheni Lexi was driving. Slavais horrified at where he's gone. Describe also the events of season 4 of the series.","completion":"RP Story: Slava sat in the crowded marshrutka, tired after a long day of work. He glanced out the window and watched as the familiar streets of Lviv passed by. Suddenly, a blinding flash enveloped the entire vehicle, causing Slava to shield his eyes. When he opened them, Slava's heart pounded in his chest. He was no longer in Ukraine. In fact, he wasn't even in the same world. He found himself standing in the middle of a bustling Chinatown, surrounded by tall buildings and unfamiliar faces. Confusion and fear overwhelmed him as he struggled to grasp what had just happened. It wasn't long until Slava noticed the massive, imposing figure of Espheni Lexi driving through the crowded streets. Panic set in as Slava realized that he had somehow ended up in the world of Falling Skies, a world overrun by alien invaders. As he watched Lexi pass by, Slava's mind raced. He knew he needed to find a way back home, but escaping this new reality seemed impossible. He had no knowledge of the local language or customs, and the presence of the Espheni only added to his sense of danger. Determined to survive, Slava cautiously made his way through the unfamiliar streets, seeking help from the resistance fighters. He encountered groups of survivors, each with their own story of loss and struggle against the Espheni occupiers. Over time, Slava learned of the events unfolding in the world of Falling Skies and understood that he was trapped in the midst of Season 4. The resistance fighters were mounting a fierce battle against the Espheni, who had begun utilizing the rebellious Lexi's powers to control and manipulate humans. Slava joined forces with the resistance, using his knowledge of technology and quick thinking to aid their cause. He formed deep connections with his fellow fighters, finding solace and camaraderie in their shared fight for freedom. Throughout Season 4, Slava witnessed the relentless attacks of the Espheni and the sacrifices made by the resistance. More characters, both human and alien, entered his life, and he saw firsthand the consequences of mistrust, betrayal, and selflessness in the midst of a war. Despite the constant danger, Slava never lost hope. He was determined to survive, to find a way back to his home in Lviv. With each passing day, he grew stronger, more skilled in the art of survival. He would not let himself be just another victim in this chaotic, dystopian world. As the season came to a close, Slava's determination paid off. A portal similar to the one that had transported him to this world unexpectedly appeared. With a mixture of relief and sadness, he bid farewell to his newfound friends and stepped through the portal, hoping to return to the comfort and familiarity of his own life. Little did he know that his journey was not yet over. The events of Falling Skies had forever changed him, leaving an indelible mark on his soul. He would carry the memories and lessons learned from this extraordinary adventure for the rest of his life, cherishing the bonds formed and the strength discovered within himself. And so, Slava's story in the world of Falling Skies came to an end. But his resilience, courage, and newfound purpose would forever shape his future, no matter where life took him next."},{"prompt":"However, Lexi was soon intercepted and she smiled and told him about his new life as a servant, her beast of burden. She was the leaders of Chinatown","completion":"Slava's heart sank as Lexi's words reached his ears. This was not the outcome he had anticipated. The hope he had held onto for a chance to escape this world shattered, replaced by the crushing reality of becoming a servant to the very entity he had once watched from a distance. Fear and anger surged within Slava, but he knew he had to remain composed. He had seen the power of the Espheni and the consequences of defying them. It was clear that challenging Lexi directly would lead to his demise. With a forced smile, Slava feigned compliance, concealing his growing resentment and determination to find a way out. He understood that survival meant playing the role of a servant, biding his time until an opportunity for escape presented itself. Days turned into weeks as Slava adapted to his new life in Chinatown. He observed Lexi's reign from the inside, witnessing the torture and oppression inflicted upon those who dared to question her authority. It became clear to him that he needed allies if he was to have any chance of escape. Slowly, Slava began to connect with the oppressed, finding solace in their shared longing for freedom. He listened to their stories of resistance, of lost loved ones, and of unyielding hope. Inspired by their strength, Slava decided it was time to take a stand. Gathering a small group of like-minded individuals, Slava devised a plan to undermine Lexi's rule. They would expose her true nature to the people of Chinatown, provoking a rebellion from within. This was their only chance at freedom, and they couldn't afford to let it slip away. As they implemented their plan, the resistance faced numerous challenges. Lexi's loyal followers, equipped with advanced Espheni technology, posed a constant threat. Slava and his allies had to rely on their wits and resourcefulness to outsmart their adversaries, constantly staying one step ahead. With each successful move, the resistance grew stronger, gaining the support of the disillusioned and oppressed. The people of Chinatown began to realize that their freedom lay not in Lexi's promises, but in their own collective power to rise against their oppressors. As the final battle approached, tensions heightened. Slava and his allies knew that the outcome would determine not only their own fate but also the fate of everyone trapped under Lexi's rule. They fought with everything they had, their determination fueled by a burning desire for justice and a longing for home. In a climactic showdown, Slava and his allies confronted Lexi. Their actions had exposed her true intentions, highlighting her manipulation and betrayal. In a fit of rage, Lexi unleashed her powers, attempting to crush the resistance once and for all. But Slava refused to back down. He stood tall, rallying his fellow fighters, reminding them of the strength they had discovered within themselves. Together, they channeled their collective resilience and determination, overpowering Lexi and defeating her once and for all. As the battle raged on, an unexpected turn of events occurred. A portal, similar to the one that had brought Slava into this world, appeared before him. This was his chance. With a mix of relief and sorrow, Slava bid farewell to his comrades, knowing that their fight would continue even without him. With a deep breath, Slava stepped through the portal, leaving behind the chaos and uncertainty of Falling Skies. He emerged back into his own world, back to Lviv, Ukraine. But the impact of his journey remained etched into his soul, forever changing his perspective and fueling his belief in the power of unity and resistance against oppression. Slava may have returned to the familiarity of his own life, but he would never forget the journey he had endured in the world of Falling Skies. He knew that true freedom was something worth fighting for, and he would carry the spirit of resistance with him always, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, Natsuki!

He boarded marshrutka route 21, like he had done countless times before. Little did he know that this journey would be unlike any other. As the marshrutka made its way through the bustling streets of Lviv, a sudden flash illuminated the vehicle. Slava felt a strange sensation, as if he was being torn from reality. His surroundings became blurry, and before he knew it, he had awaken in a completely different place. Disoriented and frightened, Slava found himself in the heart of Chinatown. The noises and smells were overwhelming, and the sight of the towering buildings brought a sense of distress. It took him a moment to realize that he had somehow entered the world of Falling Skies. Just as Slava tried to collect his thoughts, a vehicle approached him. To his horror, Espheni Lexi, one of the powerful overlords leading the alien invasion in the television series, was behind the wheel. Fear coursed through his veins as he realized the danger he was in. Slava knew he needed to find a way back to his own world and escape from the clutches of the Espheni. Gathering his courage, he cautiously approached Lexi's vehicle. In broken English, he mustered the courage to speak. \\"Um, excuse me, miss? I think I'm lost. Can you help me find my way back to where I came from?\\" Slava asked, hoping that Lexi would show some mercy, despite her role in the series. Lexi looked at Slava with a mixture of curiosity and amusement. She had never encountered a human who had accidentally stumbled into their world before. Slowly, a smile formed on her face, revealing her alien features. \\"You have found yourself in a different world, a world torn apart by war,\\" Lexi replied. \\"But fear not, for I can guide you. However, you must help us in our fight against the human resistance.\\" Reluctantly, Slava agreed, realizing he had no other choice if he wanted to navigate this unfamiliar world and find a way back home. He joined forces with Lexi, assisting her in deciphering the human resistance's strategies and plans. As the events of Falling Skies Season 4 unfolded, Slava witnessed the devastating effects of the alien invasion. He saw the resilience of the human resistance as they fought against the Espheni and struggled to survive. Slava formed bonds with the characters of the series, experiencing both heartbreak and triumph alongside them. Throughout the season, Slava used his knowledge of the series to his advantage, providing valuable insights to Lexi and her alien peers. Together, they worked to uncover weaknesses in the Espheni's defenses and unite the remaining human forces against their common enemy. Ultimately, Slava's unexpected presence in Falling Skies became a catalyst for change. Through his interactions with the characters and his determination to find a way back home, he not only contributed to the fight against the Espheni but also learned valuable lessons about courage, loyalty, and the strength of the human spirit. As the season drew to a close, Slava's unwavering determination paid off. With the help of Lexi and the remaining human resistance, he managed to find a way back through the portal that had brought him to their world. With a mix of relief and sadness, Slava bid farewell to the characters he had grown to admire and returned to his own reality, forever changed by the extraordinary adventure he had experienced."},{"prompt":"However, the matter did not end there... She herself came to the world of Glory, where there was no war through the portal","completion":"As Slava stepped through the portal, he found himself not in his own world, but in a realm known as Glory. Unlike the war-ravaged world of Falling Skies, Glory was a peaceful and vibrant place. Confused yet intrigued, Slava ventured further into this new world, hoping to find answers and perhaps a way back to his own reality. It was then that he encountered Lexi, the overlord Espheni who had inadvertently followed him through the portal. Lexi was taken aback by the beauty and tranquility surrounding her. This was a stark contrast to the chaos and destruction she had become accustomed to in the world of Falling Skies. As she walked alongside Slava, her memories of war began to fade, replaced by a newfound sense of peace and serenity. Together, Slava and Lexi explored the wonders of Glory, immersing themselves in the culture, nature, and the kind-hearted inhabitants of this world. They formed a unique bond that transcended their differences, realizing that they had much to learn from each other. As Lexi adapted to the peaceful ways of Glory, she gradually let go of her Espheni instincts, embracing her newfound humanity. With Slava by her side, she discovered the joy of simple pleasures, the beauty of compassion, and the power of love. Meanwhile, in the world of Falling Skies, the absence of Lexi did not go unnoticed. The human resistance fought valiantly against the Espheni, but something was amiss. The overlords became disoriented and uncertain without their powerful leader. It was as if a vital part of their strategy had vanished. Back in Glory, Slava and Lexi found solace in the blissful paradise they now called home. However, deep down, they both knew the war still raged in Falling Skies. With a heavy heart, Slava proposed to Lexi that they should find a way to bring peace to both worlds. Together, they devised a plan to use the portal once again, hoping to bridge the divide between the war-torn reality of Falling Skies and the peacefulness of Glory. They returned to Falling Skies, armed not with weapons, but with a message of unity and understanding. Their presence in Falling Skies sparked a profound change in the Espheni. The overlords, deeply affected by Lexi's transformation in Glory, could no longer ignore the senselessness of the war they waged. With Slava as their voice, they proposed a truce to the human resistance, laying down their weapons and initiating peace negotiations. Over time, the world of Falling Skies began to heal. Human resistance fighters worked side by side with the Espheni to restore their ravaged cities, realizing that their strength lay in unity rather than in conflict. Slava's journey had become the catalyst for a lasting peace that no one had thought possible. As for Lexi, she became a symbol of hope in both worlds. Her journey from conqueror to peacemaker inspired others to look beyond their differences and work towards a better future. Slava, now a hero in his own right, returned to Glory, forever grateful for the lessons he had learned and the friendships he had formed. And though the portal remained closed, the connection between the two worlds persisted, a reminder of the power of compassion and the potential for peace in even the darkest of times."},{"prompt":"Which of the following is an autotroph?खालीलपैकी कोणता ऑटोट्रॉफ आहे?

Это позволяет нам связать изменение величины (f(x)) с самой величиной (F(x)). 2) Для функции 5x^3 - 12x^(-1) + 45ln(x) интеграл можно взять следующим образом: ∫(5x^3 - 12x^(-1) + 45ln(x))dx = (5/4)x^4 - 12ln(x) + 45x + C, где C - произвольная постоянная. 3) Жорданова форма — это форма матрицы, в которой на диагонали стоят жордановы клетки, а все остальные элементы равны нулю. Жорданова форма используется для упрощения вычислений и изучения свойств матриц. 4) SVD (Singular Value Decomposition, сингулярное разложение) - это разложение матрицы на трех компонентах U, Σ и V. SVD используется для упрощения работы с матрицами, включая матричные вычисления и решение систем линейных уравнений. 5) ЦПТ (Центральная предельная теорема) — это математическая теорема, которая утверждает, что сумма или среднее большого числа независимых случайных величин приближается к нормальному распределению, даже если исходные величины не являются нормально распределенными. 6) ЗБЧ (Закон больших чисел) — это теорема, утверждающая, что среднее значение последовательности независимых одинаково распределенных случайных величин сходится к математическому ожиданию этой случайной величины при увеличении размера выборки. 7) Метод наименьших квадратов (МНК) выбран для оценки параметров в некоторой модели потому, что он минимизирует сумму квадратов отклонений предсказанных значений от наблюдаемых значений. Несмотря на то, что МНК основан на минимизации квадратов, он обладает ярко выраженными математическими свойствами и позволяет получить наиболее оптимальные оценки параметров. 8) Основные методы векторизации текстовых данных включают Bag of Words (мешок слов), TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) и Word Embeddings (векторные представления слов). 9) Плюсы TF-IDF: - Отражает важность термина в документе и в корпусе. - Простота в использовании и интерпретации. - Устойчивость к частым и общим словам. Минусы TF-IDF: - Не учитывает семантическую связь между словами. - Имеет сложность с обработкой новых или редких слов. - Страдает от проблем с обработкой длинных документов. Плюсы Bag of Words: - Простота в реализации и вычислениях. - Учитывает наличие или отсутствие слов в документе. Минусы Bag of Words: - Не учитывает порядок слов и смысловые связи между ними. - Имеет проблемы с разреженностью данных и хранением больших матриц. 10) Персептрон - это простейшая модель нейронной сети, состоящая из одного или нескольких входных нейронов, одного или нескольких выходных нейронов и функции активации. Он используется для классификации или решения задачи бинарной логической регрессии. 11) BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) и GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) - это два популярных алгоритма глубокого обучения для обработки естественного языка. BERT обучает модель на больших объемах неразмеченных текстов, что позволяет ему эффективно выполнять различные задачи, включая вопросно-ответную систему, определение сущностей и анализ тональности текста. GPT также обучает модель на больших текстовых данных, однако он представляет собой авторегрессионную модель, которая генерирует последовательности текста. GPT широко используется для генерации текстов, создания нейро-языковых моделей и обработки естественного языка. Оба алгоритма имеют свои преимущества и используются в различных задачах обработки текста в зависимости от потребностей. 12) Поправка Бонферрони - это метод коррекции уровня статистической значимости при множественных сравнениях. Он используется для учета инфляции вероятности ложноположительных результатов при проведении нескольких гипотезных тестов одновременно. Поправка Бонферрони заключается в делении уровня значимости на количество сравнений, чтобы уменьшить риск ложных отклонений."},{"prompt":"Как работает МНК","completion":"Метод наименьших квадратов (МНК) – это метод, используемый для оценки параметров линейной регрессии и минимизации суммы квадратов остатков между наблюдаемыми значениями и предсказанными значениями модели. Шаги метода наименьших квадратов: 1) Формулируются линейная модель и задача оптимизации. Линейная модель предполагает, что зависимая переменная представляет собой линейную комбинацию независимых переменных с некоторыми коэффициентами. Задача оптимизации состоит в нахождении наилучших значений этих коэффициентов. 2) Составляется матричное представление линейной модели. Для этого переменные объединяются в матрицу X, где каждая строка представляет собой одно наблюдение, а каждый столбец соответствует одной независимой переменной. Вектор значений зависимой переменной обозначается как y. 3) Путем минимизации суммы квадратов остатков находятся значения коэффициентов модели. Остаток – это разница между наблюдаемым значением y и предсказанным значением модели. Задача сводится к поиску таких значений коэффициентов, при которых сумма квадратов остатков минимальна. 4) Решается система линейных уравнений для нахождения значений коэффициентов. Это может быть выполнено путем взятия производных функции суммы квадратов остатков по каждому коэффициенту и приравнивания их к нулю. 5) Вычисляются значения коэффициентов модели, используя полученные решения системы линейных уравнений. 6) Оценивается точность модели и значимость коэффициентов. Это может включать проведение статистических тестов для проверки значимости коэффициентов, а также оценку показателей качества модели, таких как коэффициент детерминации R-квадрат. 7) Используется полученная модель для предсказания значений зависимой переменной на основе новых значений независимых переменных. Метод наименьших квадратов является широко распространенным и широко используется для оценки параметров в линейной регрессии, а также для решения линейных систем уравнений и других задач оптимизации, где требуется минимизация суммы квадратов."},{"prompt":"Микро и макро F1","completion":"Микро и макро F1 – это две метрики, используемые для оценки качества классификации в задачах машинного обучения, особенно в задачах с несбалансированными классами. F1-мера является средним гармоническим между точностью (precision) и полнотой (recall). Она представляет собой одну из самых широко используемых метрик в задачах классификации, особенно в случаях, когда классы несбалансированы. Микро F1-мера усредняет точность и полноту по всем классам, взвешивая их пропорционально размеру каждого класса. Таким образом, микро F1-мера уделяет равное внимание каждому классу и рассматривает задачу классификации как единую задачу. Макро F1-мера усредняет точность и полноту по каждому классу независимо друг от друга и затем усредняет полученные значения. При этом каждый класс имеет одинаковый вес при вычислении макро F1-меры. При сбалансированных классах или если каждый класс имеет одинаковую важность для задачи, микро и макро F1-меры дадут похожие результаты. Однако, если классы несбалансированы или важность классов различна, микро и макро F1-меры могут дать различные результаты. Обычно микро F1-мера предпочтительна, когда классы несбалансированы и есть классы с малым количеством наблюдений, поскольку она учитывает пропорциональное влияние каждого класса. Макро F1-мера полезна для оценки производительности модели в каждом классе независимо от его размера или важности."},{"prompt":"Как файетьюнить GPT","completion":"Fine-tuning GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) - это процесс модификации предобученной модели GPT для решения конкретных задач в области обработки естественного языка (Natural Language Processing, NLP). Ниже приведены шаги для файнтюнинга GPT: 1) Подготовка данных: Сначала необходимо подготовить данные для обучения модели. Это включает в себя разделение данных на тренировочную, валидационную и тестовую выборки, а также предобработку текстовых данных (очистка, токенизация и приведение к определенному формату). 2) Загрузка предобученной модели: Загрузите предобученную модель GPT. Обычно это делается путем загрузки весов предобученной модели, которые обычно предоставляются разработчиками. 3) Создание модели для конкретной задачи: Добавьте дополнительные слои и параметры к предобученной модели GPT, чтобы приспособить ее к конкретной задаче NLP. Например, в зависимости от задачи это может быть добавление слоя классификации или регрессии, включение специального токена для обозначения начала и конца последовательности, или изменение гиперпараметров модели. 4) Обучение модели: Проведите обучение модели на тренировочных данных, используя метод оптимизации и функцию потерь. Оптимизируйте параметры модели, чтобы минимизировать функцию потерь и максимизировать производительность модели на тренировочных данных. 5) Оценка и настройка модели: Оцените производительность модели на валидационной выборке, используя метрики, соответствующие конкретной задаче (например, точность, F1-меру или перплексию). Если необходимо улучшить производительность модели, вы можете провести настройку гиперпараметров модели (например, размер скрытого слоя, количество эпох обучения и т. д.). 6) Тестирование модели: После окончания процесса обучения и настройки модели, протестируйте ее производительность на тестовой выборке, чтобы оценить, насколько хорошо модель обобщает и работает на новых данных.

This call cancels the current timer whenever \`self.timer\` has a valid timer ID. This happens regardless of whether the slideshow is in progress or not. To fix this issue, you want to make sure that the slideshow continues to play without stopping the timer when the \\"Next\\" or \\"Previous\\" buttons are pressed. You should just reset the timer interval instead of cancelling the current running timer. Here's how you can update the \`process_image_loading_queue\` function to fix the issue: \`\`\`python def process_image_loading_queue(self): if not self.image_loading_queue.empty(): # Get the last item in the queue, which is the index of the image to load and display next while self.image_loading_queue.qsize() > 1: self.image_loading_queue.get() last_index = self.image_loading_queue.get() self.current_image_index = last_index # Check if the timer needs to be reset (avoid cancelling if the slideshow hasn't started) if not self.is_paused: self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval # Reset the timer interval to the set value if self.timer: # Check if the timer is already running self.root.after_cancel(self.timer) # Cancel the current timer self.start_timer() # Start a new timer threading.Thread(target=self.display_image).start() \`\`\` This way, if the slideshow (\`self.is_paused == False\`), the timer is reset properly, and a new timer is started. If the slideshow has not started, the image is displayed without altering the timer. Similarly, you should update the \`next_image\` and \`previous_image\` functions to not cancel the timer if \`self.timer\` exists: \`\`\`python def next_image(self, event=None): if self.image_folder != \\"\\" and not self.update_switch_timestamps(): if self.random_next_image_var.get(): self.current_image_index = random.randint(0, len(self.image_files) - 1) else: self.current_image_index = (self.current_image_index + 1) % len(self.image_files) self.queue_image_loading() # Remove threading.Thread for synchronous call if not self.is_paused: self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval # Use the stored set timer interval def previous_image(self, event=None): if self.image_folder != \\"\\" and not self.update_switch_timestamps(): if self.random_next_image_var.get(): self.current_image_index = random.randint(0, len(self.image_files) - 1) else: self.current_image_index = (self.current_image_index - 1) % len(self.image_files) self.queue_image_loading() # Remove threading.Thread for synchronous call if not self.is_paused: self.timer_interval = self.set_timer_interval # Reset the timer interval \`\`\` By doing this, every time the \\"Next\\" or \\"Previous\\" button is pressed, if the slideshow was running, it will reset the timer interval and keep the slideshow going without stopping it.

Moon Mahadasha: From birth until approx. 19 years of age (approx. until 2015) Antardasha: Antardasha represents the sub-periods within a Mahadasha. The Antardasha is determined based on the placement of the planets in your birth chart. Here is a general sequence of Antardashas during the Moon Mahadasha: 1. Moon Antardasha: From birth until approx. 1 year and 3 months of age (approx. until November 1997) 2. Mars Antardasha: From approx. 1 year and 3 months until approx. 2 years and 3 months of age (approx. November 1997 to December 1998) 3. Rahu Antardasha: From approx. 2 years and 3 months until approx. 7 years and 9 months of age (approx. December 1998 to June 2004) 4. Jupiter Antardasha: From approx. 7 years and 9 months until approx. 13 years and 3 months of age (approx. June 2004 to December 2009) 5. Saturn Antardasha: From approx. 13 years and 3 months until approx. 19 years of age (approx. December 2009 to approx. 2015) Please note that these are general timeframes based on the Moon Mahadasha for Aquarius Moon sign. For a more accurate analysis of your Mahadasha and subsequent Antardashas, it is recommended to consult with a professional Vedic astrologer. They will analyze the exact placement of planets in your specific birth chart and provide a more detailed and accurate reading."},{"prompt":"Bonjour","completion":"Bonjour!

Мне нужно вытягивать ее каждый раз на 20 мм, и обрезать. Так как мне надо делать тысячи таких действий это будет меня очень утомлять. Если устройства которые позволяет автоматизировать вытягивание и резку (например кабеля).

Такие устройства могут быть довольно дорогими и созданы для оптимизации процессов на производствах с большим объемом работ. Если же вы хотите найти более простое и экономически выгодное решение, вот несколько возможных опций: 1. **Ручной резак с измерительной лентой.** Самый простой вариант - это использовать ручной резак для композитной арматуры и прикрепить измерительную ленту к рабочему столу на нужном расстоянии. Вытягивая арматуру до метки на измерительной ленте, вы будете резать ее в нужном месте. 2. **Приспособление своими руками.** Можно изготовить простой механизм, который будет состоять из рамы, фиксирующего устройства (например, мощного зажима) и ручной резцы или болтореза. При этом можно сделать ограничитель изгибной линейки или упора, который будет контролировать длину отрезаемого сегмента. 3. **Полуавтоматический станок.** Для улучшения процесса можно попробовать модифицировать имеющийся инструмент или сделать устройство, оснащённое механизмом подачи арматуры и сенсором для резки на заданной длине. Например, можно приспособить электрический дисковый пилу или англорез с регулируемым поводком и упором. 4. **Автоматический резак или станок.** В зависимости от вашего бюджета и количества работы, может быть оправдано приобретение специализированного оборудования, которое полностью автоматизирует процесс вытягивания и резки арматуры. Помните, что если вы решите создать такое устройство самостоятельно, необходимо строго соблюдать технику безопасности и использовать надежные материалы и компоненты для избежания травм и несчастных случаев на рабочем месте.

To achieve this integration, you would generally need to perform the following steps: 1. **Understand the Revit API:** - Familiarize yourself with the Revit API, which provides a set of tools to interact with Revit models. - Examine the Revit API documentation and understand how to work with elements, properties, parameters, views, and transactions. 2. **Set up the Environment:** - Install Revit and its corresponding API on the machine where integration will take place. - Set up the development environment for creating the API integration, typically using .NET languages (C# or VB.NET) since the Revit API is .NET-based. 3. **Define the RL Model Interaction:** - Determine the specific tasks the RL model will perform within Revit, such as parameter modifications, element creation, or design optimization. - Structure inputs and outputs between the RL agent and the Revit API, ensuring that the agent's actions are translatable into API method calls. 4. **Develop a Revit Add-in:** - Create a Revit Add-in using the Revit API which will serve as the bridge between your RL model and Revit. - Make sure this Add-in can receive commands and data from the RL model, execute corresponding Revit API calls, and send results back to the RL model. 5. **Implement Data Exchange Mechanisms:** - Use interprocess communication methods such as REST APIs, TCP/IP sockets, Named Pipes, or shared databases to facilitate communication between the RL model (which may run on Python or another language/framework) and the Revit Add-in. - Ensuring data consistency and error handling is crucial for a seamless integration. 6. **Design RL-Agent Workflow:** - The RL agent must be able to send commands that are within the Revit Add-in capability, including creating and modifying elements, updating parameters, and querying for information. - Implement a feedback loop where the RL agent can make a decision, apply it to the model through the add-in, observe the results, and then refine the decision process. 7. **RL Model Training and Testing:** - Before deploying the integration, thoroughly train and test the RL model to make sure it makes decisions correctly and that these decisions translate correctly into Revit model changes. - Ensure that the model is robust to different scenarios or edge cases it might encounter in real Revit projects. 8. **Model Deployment and Execution:** - Once trained and tested, deploy the RL model, ensuring that it can interact with the Revit Add-in effectively during actual working sessions. - Monitor and log activity to ensure anomalies can be caught and debugged. 9. **Compliance with Revit Standards:** - Make sure that the actions taken by the RL agent adhere to the industry standards and practices for BIM. - Validate that the modified Revit model maintains its integrity and that data are correctly structured. 10. **User Interaction and Control:** - Provide a user interface or control mechanism to allow users to interact with the RL model, fine-tune its parameters, start/stop processes, or override automated decisions as necessary. Integrating an RL model with Revit is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of both the Revit API and the RL algorithm design. Real-time interaction can be challenging due to the computational intensity of RL algorithms, so efficient coding and possibly asynchronous workflows may be required. Additionally, any integration should be thoroughly tested to ensure reliability and accuracy before being deployed in a production environment."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, Natsuki!

Specifically, this is in the context of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model interacting with a Revit Add-in. Let's break this down: - **Reinforcement Learning (RL) model**: This is an artificial intelligence model designed to learn optimal behaviors through trial and error, by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions. - **Revit Add-in**: This refers to custom software extensions that can be integrated into Autodesk Revit, a popular software for building information modeling (BIM). These add-ins extend the functionality of Revit, allowing users to perform additional tasks. - **Implement Data Exchange Mechanisms**: The goal is to set up one or more processes that enable these two different systems (the RL model and the Revit Add-in) to communicate with each other. Different methods can be used, such as: - **REST APIs**: Representational State Transfer (REST) APIs are a set of web-based communication rules that allow one program to request data from another over the HTTP protocol. The RL model could use this method to send or retrieve data from the Revit Add-in if the latter is capable of exposing an endpoint. - **TCP/IP sockets**: This is a more low-level communication method where data is transferred over a network using TCP/IP protocols. It requires establishing a connection between the RL model and Revit Add-in which can facilitate real-time, bi-directional communication. - **Named Pipes**: Named Pipes provide inter-process communication (IPC) between processes on the same machine or across the network. They can be used as a method to enable message-based communication between the RL model and the Revit Add-in. - **Shared Databases**: Both the RL model and the Revit Add-in can interact with a common database to read and write data. This is a persistent form of communication where the database serves as a central repository of shared information. The choice of which data exchange mechanism to use will depend on the requirements such as speed, data formats, reliability, and whether the communication is within the same system or over a network. For a decentralized RL model, REST APIs or TCP/IP sockets might be more suitable, while Named Pipes could be a good choice for communication on the same machine. Ultimately, the implementation of these data exchange mechanisms requires careful design to ensure that data is transferred efficiently, securely, and without causing interruptions in either the RL model's learning process or the workflow within the Revit Add-in."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, Natsuki!

In the context of two specific applications like Autodesk Revit (a building information modeling software) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) model training algorithms, named pipes can be used as a communication bridge to share data, states, and commands between the two independent processes. Here's an overview of how named pipes could potentially be used for communication between Revit and RL model training: # On the Revit end: 1. **Command Execution**: Revit would execute certain BIM-related commands or operations as part of the model design or analysis. 2. **Data Sharing**: The results or states from Revit operations, such as the geometries of the building model, material properties, or design parameters, would need to be shared with the RL algorithm. 3. **Named Pipe Server**: Revit could act as a named pipe server, creating a pipe with a unique name and waiting for a client (the RL model training process) to connect. 4. **Serialization**: Data would need to be serialized into a format suitable for pipe communication, such as strings, bytes, or some structured format like JSON, XML, or custom binary formats. 5. **Write Operations**: Through the named pipe, Revit writes the serialized data into the pipe for the RL training algorithm to read. # On the RL model training end: 1. **Learning Algorithm**: The RL algorithm would be running separately, possibly in a different process or even a different programming language. 2. **Named Pipe Client**: The RL algorithm acts as a client that connects to the named pipe server created by Revit. 3. **Data Reception & Deserialization**: Once connected, it receives data from Revit, deserializes it to understand the building model's current state, and uses this information for model training. 4. **Action Generation**: After processing the data and depending on the learning stage, the RL algorithm would decide on actions that aim to optimize or improve the design according to the defined goals and reward functions. 5. **Write Back to Pipe**: The actions or commands generated by the RL algorithm are then serialized and written back to the named pipe, to be received by Revit. # General Considerations: - **Synchronization**: Named pipes allow for synchronous or asynchronous communication. Appropriate locking mechanisms or signaling may be required to manage when data is ready to be written or read to prevent race conditions. - **Performance**: While named pipes are quite efficient for communication on the same machine, the frequency and size of data being communicated should be managed to avoid performance bottlenecks. - **Serialization/Deserialization**: Both applications have to agree on the data format for effective communication. Custom serialization/deserialization may be necessary when sending complex data structures. The advantage of using named pipes in this scenario is that they facilitate real-time or near-real-time data exchange without the overhead of networking protocols, which is ideal for applications running on the same machine. However, in practice, integration like this can be quite complex, especially involving software like Revit that may not expose straightforward mechanisms for such integration. In those cases, developers often rely on APIs provided by the software vendors or use custom plugins to initiate and manage the IPC. Please note that while this provides a theoretical understanding of how named pipes can be used, the practical implementation details would depend heavily on the capabilities and constraints of the specific versions of the software and tools in use."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, Natsuki!

Например, если у вас в модели имеются параметры этажей, вы можете использовать их для создания подборки. - При необходимости сохраните эти поисковые подборки для дальнейшего использования. 3. **Настройка Clash Detection:** - Откройте вкладку \\"Clash Detective\\" и создайте новую проверку (New Test). - Настройте проверку для каждого этажа. Можно создать отдельную проверку для каждого этажа или группы этажей, используя ранее сохраненные поисковые подборки. - Настройте параметры проверки, такие как тип проверки (Hard, Soft, и т.д.), толерантность, правила выбора и другие. 4. **Запуск проверок:** - Запускайте проверку столкновений для каждого этажа отдельно. Результаты будут показывать потенциальные конфликты и проблемы для каждого уровня вашей модели. 5. **Анализ результатов:** - Анализируйте результаты столкновений по этажам. Нависворкс позволяет обрабатывать и управлять результатами, например, присваивать статусы и комментировать столкновения. 6. **Отчеты и дальнейшие действия:** - Создайте отчеты с результатами проверок для каждого этажа, если это требуется. - Можете использовать результаты для координации проекта и устранения столкновений с вашей командой или субподрядчиками. 7. **Оптимизация процесса:** - Есть инструменты и плагины для Navisworks, которые могут помочь автоматизировать создание подборок и запуск проверок столкновений, например, используя BIM решения для сегментации модели или расширенные настройки Clash Detective. При настроении поэтажных проверок, крайне важно убедиться, что модель структурирована таким образом, чтобы процесс выбора нужных элементов был максимально автоматизирован и не требовал большого количества ручных действий."},{"prompt":"Что делать если в модели нет параметров этажей у элементов, по которым можно было бы использовать функцию поиска по атрибутам, но проверки по этажам все равно необходимы","completion":"Если в модели нет параметров этажей у элементов, то есть несколько путей, которыми можно пойти для осуществления поэтажных проверок в Navisworks: 1. **Использование Координат:** Можно использовать осевые координаты для сегментации элементов по этажам. В зависимости от того, как организована модель, можно применить критерии поиска на основе координат Z (обычно отвечающей за высоту) для выделения элементов, находящихся на определённой высоте от нулевой точки. 2. **Ручной Выбор и Сохранение Групп:** Если модель небольшая или если есть необходимость делать проверки только на определенных этажах, вы можете вручную выбрать элементы на интересующем этаже и сохранить их как отдельную группу или поисковую подборку. 3. **Использование Инструментов Сегментации:** В некоторых случаях можно воспользоваться инструментами сегментации (Sectioning Tools) чтобы визуально отделить этажи и затем выбрать элементы вручную. 4. **Рабочие Плоскости (Work Planes):** Если в модели присутствуют рабочие плоскости, соответствующие различным уровням этажей, можно использовать их для определения границ выборки элементов. 5. **Экспорт/Импорт Информации:** Можно попробовать экспортировать информацию о модели в таблицу или базу данных, где можно будет добавить или изменить данные для создания необходимых атрибутов (например, присвоить номер этажа), затем импортировать обратно в модель. 6. **Автоматический Поиск По Иерархии:** Если модель была сгруппирована по этажам на этапе создания BIM-модели (например, в Revit), то Navisworks сохраняет эту структурную иерархию, и вы можете делать выборки по этим группам. 7. **Программное Распределение Элементов:** Возможно использование Navisworks API для написания настраиваемых скриптов или плагинов, которые могут автоматически распределять элементы по этажам на основе их расположения. 8. **Добавление Параметров Вручную:** Если проверки по этажам необходимы на регулярной основе и модель достаточно статична, вы можете вручную добавить нужные атрибуты элементам используя \\"Item Tools\\" и \\"User Defined Properties\\" в Navisworks. Каждый из этих методов имеет свои преимущества и недостатки, и выбор конкретного способа будет зависеть от размера модели, частоты необходимости расчета и доступных ресурсов для предварительной обработки модели."},{"prompt":"Распиши подробнее пункт 4","completion":"Хотя в Navisworks нет инструментов, аналогичных рабочим плоскостям в CAD- программном обеспечении вроде Revit или AutoCAD, есть способы сделать похожую отсечку, используя инструменты секционирования (Sectioning Tools). Ниже описаны действия, которые помогут вам создать поэтажные проверки, даже если в исходной модели отсутствуют параметры этажей: 1. **Создание Секции:** Вы можете пользоваться секционированием, чтобы визуально отделить отдельные этажи. В Navisworks это делается с помощью инструментов Sectioning: - Войдите во вкладку \\"Viewpoint\\" и нажмите на \\"Sectioning\\" для активации режима секционирования. - Выберите тип сечения (например, прямоугольник), которым вы хотите отсечь часть модели. - Настройте положение секции так, чтобы она проходила по границам интересующего вас этажа. 2. **Выбор Элементов:** После того как вы создали секцию и изолировали этаж, вам нужно выбрать все видимые элементы на данном этаже: - Зажмите \\"CTRL+A\\" для выбора всех видимых элементов на секции или используйте инструмент \\"Select Box\\" для выбора определенных областей (может потребоваться окно \\"Selection Tree\\" для уточнения выбора элементов). 3. **Создание Поисковой Наборки:** После выбора элементов сохраните полученный выбор как поисковую подборку (Search Set), чтобы использовать его для проверок столкновений и ревизий: - Нажмите правой кнопкой мыши на ваш выбор элементов и выберите \\"Save Selection\\". - Задайте название для поисковой подборки, которое четко идентифицирует этаж или группу элементов. 4. **Проверка Столкновений:** Теперь используйте созданную поисковую подборку для выполнения проверок столкновений (Clash Detection): - Перейдите к вкладке \\"Clash Detective\\". - В разделе \\"Select\\" используйте созданный ранее поисковой набор для одного из сторон проверок столкновения. - Настройте параметры проверки и запустите её. 5. **Сохранение Видов:** Если вам нужно часто возвращаться к определенному виду этажа, вы можете сохранить вид с секционированием: - Сделайте нужные настройки вида и нажмите \\"Viewpoints\\" для сохранения текущего обзора. - Дайте обзору имя, характеризующее этаж или нужную вам информацию. Повторяйте процесс для всех этажей, которые вы хотите проверить. Данный метод может потребовать значительного времени настройки для больших и сложных проектов, но он довольно эффективен для изоляции элементов по этажам, если в модели отсутствуют соответствующие параметры. Обратите внимание, что при каждом изменении модели или обновлении вы также можете потребовать обновления всех созданных поисковых наборов и секционных видов."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, Natsuki!

BERT is a transformer-based NLP model that can understand context within text very well. It is pre-trained on a large corpus of text and fine-tuned for specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or any task that involves understanding human language. SNNs, on the other hand, are a type of neural network that attempt to more closely mimic the behavior of biological neurons. The key characteristic of SNNs is their use of spikes — discrete events that take place at points in time — as opposed to the continuous values used in the activation functions of traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). SNNs are said to be more energy-efficient and are capable of temporal data processing, which could be beneficial for real-time intrusion detection. In general, IDS systems analyze network traffic and system activities to detect malicious behavior or policy violations. Integrating BERT within an IDS might be considered if you are dealing with data that is text-based or includes elements that might benefit from NLP, such as parsing log files, interpreting system alerts, or analyzing network packets that contain textual data (e.g., HTTP requests). To use BERT alongside SNNs in the context of an IDS, you would typically take the following steps: 1. Preprocessing: Convert the network traffic or system logs into a format that can be tokenized for BERT. 2. Feature Extraction: Use BERT to extract features from the textual data. The output could be the embeddings generated by the BERT model that encapsulate the semantic meanings of the text. 3. Spiking Neural Network Integration: Use these embeddings as input to an SNN. The SNN would analyze these features over time, potentially making use of their temporal (sequence-based) nature if applicable. 4. Detection and Decision: The final output layer of the SNN would then be used to make a determination on whether the input represents normal behavior or a potential intrusion. Combining these two different models in this way could provide a comprehensive approach to intrusion detection. BERT can interpret and provide context to the content, while SNNs can handle the temporal aspects and sequence analysis to look for patterns that indicate malicious behavior. However, there are challenges in such an integration: - Computational Overhead: BERT models are computationally intensive, and IDS needs to operate in almost real-time. - Integration Complexity: SNNs are less mature in their development compared to ANNs, and mixing both types of neural networks for a hybrid approach might complicate the system design. - Data Representation: Bridging the gap between BERT's language understanding capabilities and SNN's spike-based computations requires thoughtful preprocessing and feature engineering. Given the current state of technology, it may be more common to see BERT used exclusively for textual data and SNNs for time-series or sensory data within their respective specialties. However, research into the fusion of different AI approaches is always ongoing, and there could indeed be potential in exploring such a hybrid system for complex tasks like intrusion detection."},{"prompt":"which one is best for IDS (BERT or SNNs)","completion":"Determining the \\"best\\" technology for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) depends greatly on the nature of the data being analyzed, the specific requirements of the system, and the type of intrusions or anomalies that need to be detected. Here's a brief overview of the strengths and use cases for each when considering their application in IDS: **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** BERT and other language models excel at understanding and processing human language. They are best suited for IDS scenarios where the data involves textual content, such as analyzing system logs, phishing emails, or any kind of intrusion that can be detected through text analysis. BERT can provide contextual understanding of text, which can reveal malicious intent or anomalies hidden within natural language communications. Use cases for BERT in IDS: - Analyzing command-line arguments or logs for signs of exploitation or unauthorized access. - Detecting phishing or social engineering attempts in emails based on text analysis. - Processing network traffic that contains textual information, such as HTTP requests or DNS queries, for signs of malicious payloads. **SNNs (Spiking Neural Networks):** SNNs are inspired by the way biological neural networks operate, using spikes for information processing. They are particularly effective for time-series data and can process information in a more energy-efficient manner, mimicking the temporal dynamics of real-world signals. SNNs might be more suitable for IDS that requires real-time analysis of raw, spatio-temporal data streams. Use cases for SNNs in IDS: - Monitoring real-time network traffic flows for patterns indicative of reconnaissance, lateral movement, or denial-of-service attacks. - Analyzing time-series data from system performance metrics to detect resource anomalies that may indicate a breach or a malware infection. - Processing sensor data in an Industrial Control System (ICS) environment to detect deviations from normal operational patterns. **Conclusion:** The choice between BERT and SNNs for IDS is not necessarily a matter of which is universally better but rather which is more appropriate for the task. If your data includes a significant textual component, BERT or similar NLP models can provide deep insights. On the other hand, if the data is more about patterns over time or involves sensor readings and similar time-series data, an SNN or a more traditional ML approach designed for sequence data, such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), might be a better fit. In many cases, a hybrid approach can be taken, with different models handling different aspects of the data, or an ensemble approach where multiple models contribute to the final decision, capitalizing on the strengths of each. It's also possible that as research progresses, new methodologies or hybrid systems could emerge that blend these technologies in innovative ways to provide robust IDS solutions."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, Natsuki!

This can be done by starting a timer every time a button press occurs and resetting it if another press happens within 500ms. If no button press occurs within that timeframe, the timer will elapse and execute the image loading logic. Here's one way to integrate the debounce behavior into your existing code: 1. Add a new method \`debounced_image_load\` that will hold the timer logic. 2. Update the \`next_image\` and \`previous_image\` methods to call \`debounced_image_load\` instead of directly interacting with the image loading queue. 3. Adjust the \`queue_image_loading\` method to handle the scenario you are asking for. 4. Ensure there is a cancel logic for the debouncing timer if any other event interrupts (e.g., a new button press, a folder change, or starting the slideshow). Here's an example of how you can implement it: \`\`\`python import threading # ... # New attribute to store the debounce timer reference self.debounce_timer = None self.debounce_timer_lock = threading.Lock() # The debounced_image_load method def debounced_image_load(self, interval=500): with self.debounce_timer_lock: # Ensure thread safety on the debounce_timer if self.debounce_timer is not None: self.root.after_cancel(self.debounce_timer) self.debounce_timer = self.root.after(interval, self.load_current_image) # The load_current_image method to handle actual image loading def load_current_image(self): with self.debounce_timer_lock: # Ensure thread safety on the debounce_timer self.debounce_timer = None self.queue_image_loading() # Updated next_image and previous_image to use the debounced_image_load method def next_image(self, event=None): # The rest of your next_image logic here... self.debounced_image_load() def previous_image(self, event=None): # The rest of your previous_image logic here... self.debounced_image_load() # Call debounced_image_load instead of queue_image_loading where needed # ... \`\`\` Please note that this example assumes you have a \`root\` Tkinter object that has the method \`after\` which can schedule events, and \`after_cancel\` which can cancel scheduled events. The \`interval\` parameter is set to 500 milliseconds, which delays the execution of 'load_current_image' long enough to allow for any additional button presses that may reset the timer. With the \`debounced_image_load\` method, the image loading will only occur after 500ms of no button presses, allowing rapid presses to be registered without immediately triggering image loads. This should create the user experience you are describing."},{"prompt":"how to make it bypass when the image name is shown. i want the debounce to just affect the last current image shown","completion":"If you want to adjust the debounce functionality so that it applies only to the last current image shown, and not when the image name is being displayed quickly (during rapid presses), you could add a condition that checks if the image name is being shown or if the actual image is displayed. Here's how you could adjust your existing code with the new debounce mechanism that skips the debounce when you're just displaying image names: \`\`\`python # New attribute to track whether the image name is being shown self.showing_image_name = False def display_image(self): # Rest of your display_image logic... if self.update_switch_timestamps(): self.showing_image_name = True # ... show the text of the image name else: self.showing_image_name = False # ... load the image normally if not quick-switching # ... def debounced_image_load(self, interval=500): # We only want to debounce the loading of the actual image, not the image name. if not self.showing_image_name: with self.debounce_timer_lock: # Ensure thread safety on the debounce_timer if self.debounce_timer is not None: self.root.after_cancel(self.debounce_timer) self.debounce_timer = self.root.after(interval, self.load_current_image) \`\`\` With this adjustment, when you call \`debounced_image_load\` from \`next_image\`, \`previous_image\`, or any other relevant method, the debounce will be bypassed if \`self.showing_image_name\` is \`True\`, which happens when you are displaying image names during rapid presses. If \`self.showing_image_name\` is \`False\`, the debounce will work normally, ensuring that it only applies to the actual image display. This will allow rapid presses to show image names quickly without delay, but once the user pauses, the last image will load after the specified debounce interval (500ms by default). Remember to call \`debounced_image_load\` in your navigation methods (\`next_image\`, \`previous_image\`) instead of directly calling the image loading functions."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “Alright, Natsuki!

Here's an example: \`\`\`glsl mat4 myMatrix; vec3 scale; void main() { // Set the transformation matrix to some value myMatrix = mat4( vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), vec4(0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0), vec4(0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0), vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) ); // Extract the scale from the matrix scale = vec3(length(myMatrix[0]), length(myMatrix[1]), length(myMatrix[2])); } \`\`\` In this example, the \`scale\` vector will store the scale factors along each axis. The length of each column vector of the matrix corresponds to the scaling factor applied to each axis. Note that this method assumes that the scale factors are uniform across all axes. If you need to extract non-uniform scale factors, you'll need to modify the approach accordingly."},{"prompt":"Is this code ignore rotation?","completion":"Apologies for the confusion. You are correct; the provided code does not take into account any rotation present in the transformation matrix. If you want to extract the scale while considering the rotation as well, you can use a different approach. Here's an updated example: \`\`\`glsl mat4 myMatrix; vec3 scale; void main() { // Set the transformation matrix to some value myMatrix = mat4( vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), vec4(0.0, 2.0, 0.0, 0.0), vec4(0.0, 0.0, 3.0, 0.0), vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) ); // Extract the scale from the matrix scale = vec3( length(myMatrix[0].xyz), length(myMatrix[1].xyz), length(myMatrix[2].xyz) ); } \`\`\` In this updated code, we take the length of the first three columns of the matrix after excluding the fourth column, which contains the translation part. This accounts for both rotation and scale components."},{"prompt":"как рассчитать середину отрезка в 2д пространстве?

Вот пример кода на языке GLSL (этот код можно использовать в GLSL-шейдере): \`\`\`glsl vec2 startPoint; vec2 endPoint; vec2 midPoint; void main() { // Установите координаты начала и конца отрезка startPoint = vec2(0.0, 0.0); endPoint = vec2(4.0, 4.0); // Рассчитываем середину отрезка midPoint = (startPoint + endPoint) / 2.0; } \`\`\` В этом примере \`midPoint\` будет содержать координаты середины отрезка."},{"prompt":"А как высчитать угол между двумя точками в 2д пространстве?","completion":"Для вычисления угла между двумя точками в двумерном пространстве вам понадобится использовать тригонометрию. Вы можете использовать функцию \`atan\` для вычисления арктангенса и получения угла. Вот пример кода на языке GLSL: \`\`\`glsl vec2 point1; vec2 point2; float angle; void main() { // Установите координаты двух точек point1 = vec2(1.0, 1.0); point2 = vec2(3.0, 4.0); // Вычисляем разницу в координатах vec2 diff = point2 - point1; // Вычисляем угол между точками angle = atan(diff.y, diff.x); } \`\`\` В этом примере \`angle\` будет содержать угол между точками \`point1\` и \`point2\` в радианах.

This process is aimed at a well-coordinated and consistent development of the application. Development starts with defining the correct database structures. In this case, four tables (DevOps processes, WorkItemTypes, TeamsDevOpsFieldMappings, TeamsDevOpsValueMappings) are set up to store the necessary data. In addition, specific fields relevant to project-specific information are added to an existing table (project), such as SharePoint's LatestChangeToken and Target DevOps Area Path/Iteration. Based on the database structure, the necessary controllers, services and repositories are automatically generated in the API (Web). This process is made possible by a custom generator that creates standard components based on the table definitions. These generated elements form the interface between the database and the front-end, creating streamlined communication. The front-end is developed with the controllers, services and repositories in the API (Web) as an intermediate layer. The Vue.js application uses these API functionalities to create screens that connect directly to the database data. The component-based structure of the front end makes it possible to build specific functionalities, such as lists, editing views and forms, that integrate seamlessly with the API. This database-led development process provides a standardized and consistent approach to application building. Automatically generating API components from the database minimizes errors and promotes uniformity across the application. The development from the database provides a solid foundation, which is essential for a reliable and well-functioning synchronization tool. Data flow in the synchronization tool The companyX synchronization tool creates a smooth interaction between the front-end, Web API and Integrations. It forms the core of the tool, with each component playing a specific role in the whole. The starting point is in the front-end, where users are in control. They navigate through the data and edit sync mappings and project-specific values ​​via the Web API. While the front end manipulates local data, it also searches for external sound. Integrations comes into the picture here and integrates external data, such as DevOps processes, into the synchronization tool. Conversely, Integrations receives calls from SharePoint and DevOps when notifications change there. Integrations combines this external information with the local data from the Web API, creating a new notification. Importantly, nothing is permanently saved during the synchronization process, except a status indicating which notification has been modified. This creates a transient element in the bigger picture of the sync tool. In this way, the interplay between the front-end, Web API and Integrations unfolds as a functional exchange of data, where each component fulfills a specific role in the synchronization process. Realization Preliminary investigation Before I started developing the sync tool, my internship started with doing research and getting acquainted with the systems & technologies I would come into contact with. Because the sync tool is aimed at the Microsoft Teams and Azure DevOps platforms, I used this as a starting point. With the wealth of documentation available online, I started exploring the APIs offered by these two platforms. In Postman I created collections where I could build and test a collection of knowledge and useful HttpRequests which helped enrich my knowledge and could later be applicable when implementing the tool. The collection started with making a simple call to DevOps to retrieve a list of projects. Because my implementation would develop in OPAL's existing APIs built in ASP NET Core, I created a web API that communicated with the DevOps API and served as an intermediate platform. From Swagger or Postman I could call the endpoints and perform DevOps actions, but also extend the API with functionalities such as retrieving projects, viewing a single one, adding and removing.","completion":"**Positive Aspects:** 1. **Structured Development Process**: Your description of the step-by-step development process starting from the database to the APIs and onto the front-end is methodically laid out. This shows a clear line of progression and ensures that each component is built on a solid foundation. 2. **Data-Driven Design**: By focusing first on the database structures before proceeding with the rest of the application, you underscore the importance of data integrity and consistency throughout the tool. This foundational focus is critical for applications that handle synchronization across systems. 3. **Automation in Code Generation**: Utilizing a custom generator to create standard components based on table definitions in the API is an efficient use of resources that likely reduces development time and errors. This automation aspect speaks to companyX’s innovative approach to software development. 4. **Front-end Integration**: Building the front-end to interact seamlessly with the Web API demonstrates a cohesive understanding of full-stack development.

Moreover, real-life examples and a focus on user experience can solidify the tool's value proposition within companyX."},{"prompt":"Proof of Concept Goal and approach After the preliminary research, it was time to create a Proof of Concept in which I focused on realizing the fundamental functionalities required for the operation of the sync tool. This approach ensured a higher success rate of the end product and assured progression, even if at a small level. It was not convenient to immediately start working in the OPAL front and back-end systems and projects, because they are already quite complex and extensive, there is a learning curve and implementing small functionalities was very time-intensive in the beginning. A better approach was to start from scratch in separate new projects, but because the OPAL APIs already used to communicate with the SharePoint and DevOps services using the projects table in which all reference data to the platforms was stored, it was easier to communicate to the platforms via the existing APIs. I used these examples as a starting point and modified them to my liking so that I could quickly implement working functionalities and learn how to use the clients that the platforms offer. The ultimate goal was to have all actions related to synchronization happen automatically without human interaction, but with the idea of ​​starting as simply as possible, we left this aside for now. In order to communicate visually with the endpoints and perform actions, I created a Windows Form Application project. Functionalities The first functionality was retrieving a Teams notification from a list, linked to an OPAL project. In the Form Application I built a simple screen that only had the option to enter a number for the teams notification that the user wants to look up and with the push of a button the notification was requested from the Integrations API. The information was displayed to the user in the presence of a teams notification with the specified ID. The next step in the synchronization process was to add the retrieved notification to a DevOps project.","completion":"**Positive Aspects:** 1. **Phased Approach**: Your decision to build a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates a prudent and risk-averse approach. Starting with fundamental functionalities before progressing to more complex system integration was smart, particularly in complex environments. 2. **Focused Scope**: Concentrating on essential, achievable tasks for the PoC allowed for tangible progress and learning opportunities. This staged development strategy can offer early insights into potential challenges and areas for improvement. 3. **Use of Existing Infrastructure**: Leveraging the existing OPAL APIs to communicate with SharePoint and DevOps services was a tactical move. It allowed you to build on proven systems and accelerate the development process, which is a practical approach to innovation. 4. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Beginning with straightforward tasks – retrieving Teams notifications linked to an OPAL project – and presenting results through a basic form application underscores a commitment to clarity and user accessibility, which is pivotal during early development stages. 5. **Learning Emphasis**: Your strategy allowed you to quickly learn and understand the clients offered by the platforms while implementing working functionalities. This emphasis on learning is important in the development of complex tools and ensures a more robust final product. 6. **Automation as Final Goal**: The direction towards full automation of the synchronization process – even if not realized in the initial PoC – shows a focus on efficiency and improvement of work processes. **Areas for Improvement:** 1. **Incremental Functionality**: It would benefit to detail the step-by-step additions of functionality in the PoC and how each interaction or functionality brought the tool closer to the desired final state. 2. **Human Interaction and User Experience**: Although automation is the ultimate goal, the PoC phase should integrate elements of user feedback or interaction to understand usage patterns and potential user-interface design considerations. 3. **Testing and Validation**: Describe the approach to testing the PoC and how results are validated. What were the success criteria, and how did they align with expectations or requirements? 4. **Error Handling and Troubleshooting**: An explanation of how the PoC manages errors and any troubleshooting steps could provide insights into the tool's reliability in its nascent stage. 5. **Security Measures**: For a synchronization tool handling potentially sensitive project data, including a brief overview of security considerations would reinforce the seriousness with which the PoC treats data integrity and protection. 6. **Performance Metrics**: The PoC report should ideally include any metrics defined and tracked during this phase, such as response times or data throughput, providing objective measures of the PoC's success and areas needing attention. **General Recommendations:** - Expand the PoC section to recount the iterative addition of functionality and the lessons learned at each stage. - Incorporate direct user interactions within the PoC process, even if the final goal is to eliminate human intervention, to discern any UI/UX improvements. - Clearly articulate the testing and validation protocol used to evaluate the PoC functionalities. - Outline any error handling processes or contingencies considered during the PoC development. - Develop and describe initial security protocols or practices that ensure data safety within the PoC. - Define and present early performance metrics to quantify the PoC's efficiency and effectiveness. Overall, the PoC phase appears well-conceived and foundational for the whole project, with an appropriate emphasis on learning and gradual complexity. Enhancing the report with the discussed improvements will communicate a comprehensive overview of the early stages of the sync tool development and provide a solid foundation for further work and analysis."},{"prompt":"Synchronization flow Teams – OPAL – DevOps relationship To successfully realize a product, it is essential to properly map the relationships between the entities involved. We have already established in previous chapters that OPAL is the internal project management system and a Teams and DevOps project can be created for projects. Previously, it was the rule that a Teams was created for each project and that they also had their own DevOps, but nowadays it is also possible that multiple OPAL projects are linked to one team. This is possible, for example, because a customer has a project in development at companyX and has purchased a permanent product such as the Diamond Online Forms. For our sync tool, this means that we must take into account that not all notifications from a Teams list must be sent to one DevOps project. To determine which DevOps the notifications go to, I have added an extra column in the projects table called “ApplicationName”. In the Teams list there is already a field “Application” from which you can choose from a set of standard - values, these values ​​are filled with the project name by default when generating the Teams in OPAL. The idea behind the new “ApplicationName” column is that when an incoming teams notification comes from a list linked to multiple OPAL projects, the project is searched for on the “Application” and the notification is sent to the associated DevOps. Desired operation of sync tool [Desired operation of sync tool] Teams - DevOps Mapping As described above in the operation of the sync tool, an incoming Teams notification must be added or updated in the DevOps project linked to the combination of the associated OPAL project and the chosen ApplicationName in the Teams notification. Because the objects of the two platforms are not identical and not all fields apply in the two systems, they must be converted into a suitable form. In a normal situation this can easily be done by casting the objects to each other and filling in the fields, but in the case of Teams & DevOps this works slightly differently. Problem A Teams notification always has the same fields, but a DevOps notification does not. This is because Azure offers the ability to assign a project to a process. The processes are used to manage DevOps notifications and are essential for optimizing workflow and project success. Azure offers out-of-the-box standard processes Basic, Agile, Scrum & CMMI. In these processes, the notification types are defined with the corresponding fields for each type (Microsoft Learn, 2023). This system ensures that the notification system can be adjusted to the needs of a project, but creates a critical problem for the synchronization tool. Because the fields and possible values ​​of a DevOps notification can differ across notification types, but also across processes, it is not possible to cast a Teams notification to a fixedly defined form. Solution The difference between the two platforms lies at the level of the notifications, their fields and values. To find out which value belongs in a field of a DevOps notification with a specific WorkItemType in a specific process and visa-versa, we can persist this information in the database to retrieve the information later when used. The database tables consist of four levels regarding the mapping between the two systems: DevOps Process -> DevOps WorkItemType -> FieldMappings -> ValueMappings [7.1 Database Structure]. Now that we have a way to capture the mappings, we still need to implement a functionality that makes it possible to convert a Teams notification to a DevOps notification and vice versa. Call Converting Flow Converting a report from one platform to another requires a number of steps, some of which are initial and some repetitive. We start with the input. This can be a Teams notification or DevOps notification, for the explanation we will use a Teams notification as an example. For the conversion, we start with a few entities: The Teams notification, a DevOps process of the project where the DevOps notification ends up and the desired DevOps notification type. With this information, we look up the records in the database that match the data of the DevOps process and notification type. This will allow us to look up the mappings later. An activity diagram can be viewed for support and visualization in [Figure 1 - Activity Diagram Call-Converter] Not all fields of the notification need to be synchronized to DevOps because this is platform-specific or not desired by the user (e.g.: List-related information). It is important that we determine in advance which fields will be mapped. Because Teams notifications have fixed fields, we can define this in the code. Here we see that we want to convert the fields: title, description, priority and status. We use the basic information to convert the notification and this works as follows: For each field we look up the field mapping in the persistent DevOps process and notification type so that we know what the field is called in DevOps (e.g.: “Status” -> “State”) and we look up the value mappings with which we can look up the field value. As shown below, there may be no field mapping for a field and a specific notification type because it is not present and we ignore the Teams field in the conversion. Now that we have found the name of the DevOps field, we still have to determine which value will end up in the field. One or more value mappings are linked to the field mapping. These can be two scenarios: There is one record whose Teams and DevOps value is '*', this means that the value of the Teams field must be transferred to DevOps There are one or more records present, here we look for the mapping with our Teams value and put the corresponding DevOps value into our DevOpsMapping object. By doing these steps for all Teams fields, we end up with an object that contains a list of combinations of DevOps field names and values ​​specific to the incoming DevOps process and notification type, our DevOps notification. To go from a DevOps notification to a Teams notification, the implementation is slightly different. Because we do not know the field names of the notification, we cannot determine the convertible properties, as with a Teams notification, and cannot assume a defined object as input. To remain flexible, in addition to a DevOps process and notification type, we receive as input a list of combinations of field names and values ​​that must be mapped to a Teams notification. Here too we will try to find the corresponding field mapping and value mappings for each field.","completion":"**Positive Aspects:** 1. **Comprehensive Approach**: The explanation of the synchronization flow demonstrates a well-thought approach to understanding the complexity of relationships between Teams, OPAL, and DevOps. The recognition of various scenarios and your meticulous planning of dealing with these is commendable. 2. **Creative Solutions to Complex Problems**: The identification of the issue with varying DevOps notification fields and the subsequent solution using persistent storage in the database for field mappings show innovative problem-solving. This is a clever way to manage the interoperability between different systems. 3. **Visualization of Processes**: The inclusion of an activity diagram to illustrate the call conversion flow is a smart choice. Visual aids can be instrumental in reinforcing understanding for both technical and non-technical readers. 4. **Attention to User Requirements**: Acknowledging that not all fields are necessary for synchronization and allowing for user-defined mappings ensures that the tool caters to real user needs and preferences. 5. **Detail-Oriented**: Your report provides an impressive level of detail in the description of the mechanisms of the synchronization flow, which is crucial for understanding how the system operates. **Areas for Improvement:** 1. **Explanation of Field Mapping Logic**: While the synchronization flow is well-described, it could benefit from a more detailed explanation of how the field and value mappings logic was developed and the reasoning behind certain design choices. 2. **User Experience Considerations**: There is an opportunity to discuss how the user interacts with the synchronization tool during this flow. For instance, detailing how they specify or modify field mappings would enhance the understanding of the user journey. 3. **Error Handling**: A description of how the system handles cases where mappings do not exist or synchronization fails would be valuable. Understanding the error handling and the user’s experience in such scenarios is important. 4. **Security Measures**: Given that data is being transferred between systems, any security protocols or measures taken to ensure the safe and secure synchronization of data is crucial information that should be included in the report. 5. **Performance Evaluation**: Discussion around the performance of the synchronization process, such as time taken for synchronization or handling large volumes of notifications, would add a valuable layer of analysis. 6. **Technical Jargon**: There is a significant amount of technical jargon that might not be accessible to all readers. Clarifying terms or simplifying explanations will make the report more inclusive. **General Recommendations:** - Expand on the logic behind the field mapping and discuss alternative approaches considered during design. - Include more information on the user’s interaction with the synchronization tool, focusing on the UX/UI design. - Describe the error handling process in detail – what happens when a field cannot be mapped, and how is this communicated to the user? - Address security concerns, detailing how data is protected during the synchronization process. - Include performance metrics to assess and ensure efficiency, especially under different operational loads. - Clarify technical terms and simplify explanations to cater to a wider audience range, potentially appending a glossary for more complex terms. The synchronization flow section is critical as it brings together the various subsystems into a holistic operation. Paying attention to the above areas and recommendations will not only enhance the clarity of your report but will also demonstrate a deep commitment to all aspects of the synchronization tool, from security to user experience and system scalability."},{"prompt":"SharePoint Webhook Operation The expected operation of the sync tool is mainly that the actions are automated and this does not have to be done by a companyX employee. Having an implementation for adding or updating a notification in the other system is very nice, but to initiate this process a trigger must still be present. A solution could be to periodically synchronize the notifications regardless of whether adjustments have been made, but this has the disadvantage that it may take a while before the information is synchronized. To solve this you could reduce the period between synchronizations, but that will use unnecessary resources and reduce the performance of the OPAL system. A smart solution is to use webhooks. A webhook is, at its core, a user-defined Http callback that enables real-time communication between different web applications. They allow applications to subscribe to certain events and receive notifications when these events occur. The automated, asynchronous updates between applications eliminate the need for constant manual intervention or repetitive polling. (AppMaster, 2023) By using webhooks that listen to new teams notifications that are added or existing ones that are changed and send our API a notification when a modification has taken place, we can initiate synchronization in a resource-efficient, performance-saving on-demand manner. SharePoint offers webhooks for various scenarios and resources, the most popular being for document libraries and lists. Customers' Teams notifications are maintained in SharePoint lists (H2.3 Terminology clarification), making this a suitable solution for our tool. Manage subscription Before we can receive webhook notifications, we first need to create a webhook. Here are some requirements from SharePoint and our implementation. SharePoint expects a valid resource on which the subscription should be created, a URL where the notifications should be sent and an expiration date. When requesting to create a subscription, SharePoint sends a validation request to the URL to ensure valid operation. From our tool, the requirements are synchronization-oriented. A webhook subscription should only be created when there is a Teams & DevOps associated with the specified OPAL project, because getting notifications of notifications that we cannot sync anywhere is not useful and a waste of resources. To validate the origin of the notifications, a so-called ClientState is also added. This ClientState is a random string that will be sent with every notification. From our implementation we can then check whether the ClientState matches and ignore or process the notification. In addition to creating a SharePoint webhook subscription, the API also supports the option to retrieve or delete a subscription. These actions can be invoked from the front-end application through the use of a simple switch allowing the user to easily manage subscriptions for the OPAL projects. Extension of subscription Unfortunately, the expiration date of a SharePoint webhooks subscription can be set to a maximum of 180 days. This is a choice Microsoft made, probably to remove inactive subscriptions that are forgotten by the user and save resources. We do not want an employee to have to manually create it again every 180 days from the moment a subscription was created, but for the subscription to always exist. One way to achieve this is by periodically renewing the notification. When we send an HttpRequest to create a subscription on a resource where it already exists, it is extended with the new expiration date. A JobService project is also present in the OPAL back-end. This job service will run the deployments periodically depending on the settings stored for individual job services in the database. In our API controller for the TeamsWebhook there is an endpoint that returns for an OPAL project whether it currently has a SharePoint webhook subscription. A written job service will check every four months for all existing projects whether there is a subscription and extend it again by 180 days. This ensures the user of constant operation of the sync tool, consistency of data between the two platforms and gives the product owner at least two months to resolve an issue if it occurs before a subscription can expire. Processing changes Unfortunately, when sending a notification, SharePoint does not provide the details of the modified notifications, but a list of resources to which adjustments have been made. This can allow SharePoint to bundle notifications for changed resources and notifications into one HttpRequest instead of sending multiple times with information from a single resource or notification. We will therefore first have to retrieve the adjusted notifications before we can do anything with them. SharePoint has its own system for this that works as follows: When adjusting a teams notification, adding, modifying or removing, SharePoint stores a data point in a list of changes that includes the ID of the changed item, the save the moment of change and a unique ChangeToken. From an HttpClient such as Postman or the CSOM the user can retrieve a list of changes and use the ID of the notification to retrieve them second from the teams list. A reference implementation is visualized in [Figure 2 - SharePoint Webhook Reference Implementation Flow] For the sync tool we only want to process new changes and not the ones we have already processed. This is where the ChangeToken comes in handy. SharePoint offers the option of retrieving changes that occurred after a certain ChangeToken, in addition to retrieving all changes. An extra column “LatestTeamsChangeToken” has been added in the projects table that keeps track of this token. In the absence of this token (in the case of a new Teams list/SharePoint webhook subscription), the penultimate change will be retrieved and processed. Unfortunately, the retrieved changes do not yet contain the information we need, the only useful information is the ID of the teams notification that has been modified, using the CSOM we can query the corresponding Teams list in which we are searching to teams notifications with an ID present in the list of changes. Now that we have the Teams notifications associated with a change, we can start processing the notification. From Teams to DevOps there are three actions that can be initiated depending on the change type: Addition When adding a Teams notification, there will be no DevOps notification for it and we will have to create one. For the associated OPAL project, we first retrieve the process for the DevOps project and choose the -notifications type based on the Teams notification “Type”, we need this information for the notifications conversion. After successfully adding a DevOps notification, we need to add the ID to the Teams notification so that the notifications have a reference to each other. In the notifications list there is a column called “DevOpsId” where we can enter this Id. The process of processing a new Teams call is visualized in [Figure 3 - Activity Diagram Processing Addition Teams call]. Update Processing an updated Teams notification is quite simple, first of all we check for the presence of the “DevOpsId” field and check whether this notification is also present in the DevOps project. If this is not the case, we will empty this field in the Teams notification and cancel the synchronization. Similar to processing a new Teams notification, we need to look up the DevOps process and notification type to convert the notification. When updating, we must take into account that the teams notification has been given a different type than the DevOps notification was initially created with, even though this will not happen often. This results in a DevOps notification from conversion that does not match the current fields in the associated DevOps notification. To resolve this, the DevOps notification type must first be adjusted before updating field values. Processing an updated Teams call is visualized in [Figure 6 - Activity Diagram Processing Update Teams call]. Deletion: When a Teams notification is deleted, the only action that needs to be taken is to remove the reference to the Teams notification in the associated DevOps notification. This prevents a Teams notification from being found when synchronizing the DevOps notification and ensures data consistency. One problem we are encountering here is that based on the change we cannot retrieve the Teams notification from the Teams list because it has been deleted. As a result, we also do not know the number of the associated DevOps notification. One way to look up the DevOps notification is to look for a combination of the ID of the Teams notification and the unique URL of the notification in the DevOps projects linked to the Teams list. Processing a deleted Teams call is visualized in [Figure 5 - Activity Diagram Processing Deletion Teams call]. After the change is successfully processed, we need to save the DevOps notification data to the WebhookModifiedDevOpsCalls database table to ignore the new item's webhook notification and prevent the webhook loop. We will also need to update the LatestTeamsChangeToken for the OPAL projects for which notifications have been processed. By updating this token we assure the user that when calling the webhook later, only the new changes will be retrieved. The entire process of receiving and processing a SharePoint webhook notification is visualized in [Figure 4 - Activity Diagram Teams Webhook].","completion":"**Positive Aspects:** 1. **Automated Synchronization**: Your goal to automate actions and minimize manual intervention is commendable. The implementation of webhooks to trigger synchronization enhances efficiency and demonstrates a modern approach to application integration. 2. **Efficient Utilization of Resources**: The decision to rely on webhooks rather than periodic polling showcases good resource management and a performance-first mindset, which is both resource-efficient and performance-saving. 3. **Strategic Subscription Management**: Your method for managing webhook subscriptions, including the consideration of necessary conditions and the use of ClientState for validation, shows strategic thinking. The provision for managing subscriptions from the front end provides flexibility and control to users. 4. **Subscription Extension Planning**: The foresight to address the limitation of the SharePoint webhook subscription duration by periodically renewing the subscription through JobService is proactive and ensures the tool's continuous operation. 5. **Change Management**: Utilizing SharePoint’s ChangeToken system to track and process changes selectively is a smart method, ensuring that only new and relevant changes trigger the synchronization process. 6. **Detailed Flow Diagrams**: Including activity diagrams to visualize the different processing scenarios for Teams notifications—additions, updates, and deletions—is exceedingly beneficial for understanding complex workflows. **Areas for Improvement:** 1. **Clarity on Subscriptions and Types of Changes**: While you detailed the overarching process of handling webhook notifications, it would be useful to distinguish the types of changes that trigger notifications and how those are handled differently. 2. **Handling Webhook Failures**: Address possible webhook failures or misfires, outlining fallback procedures or error management strategies to ensure reliability. 3. **Security Measures**: As webhooks involve data transfer, discussing the security measures in place or the measures planned to protect webhook communications would be critical. 4. **User Experience Considerations**: Although a technical report, exploring how users interact with the webhook notifications from a UI/UX perspective, including management and monitoring, adds an essential dimension to the user-centric design approach. 5. **Performance Metrics and Scalability**: Include discussion on performance benchmarks for the webhook process, such as latency, and how the system scales with increasing numbers of notifications. 6. **Technical Language Simplification**: Given the report's technical depth, simplifying language or providing a glossary could make the content more accessible to all stakeholders. **General Recommendations:** - Provide clear and succinct explanations of the different types of changes and how the system reacts to each scenario. - Develop comprehensive error handling procedures for webhook failures and document them for stakeholder assurance. - Outline the security measures or protocols in place to protect the data and system integrity during the webhook communication process. - Incorporate user experience aspects of webhook management, focusing on how users are alerted to, interact with, and maintain webhooks within the system. - Discuss performance metrics, including how they influence the system design and synchronization process scaling. - Where technical concepts are used, consider simplifying the language or providing explanations in a glossary or appendices. The synchronization flow is well-conceived and demonstrates a professional approach to automating synchronization between Teams, OPAL, and DevOps. Enhancing the report with the recommended improvements can further solidify stakeholders' understanding and confidence in the tool's design and functionality."},{"prompt":"DevOps Webhook Operation Like SharePoint [8.6.1 (SharePoint Webhook) Operation], DevOps offers support for webhooks that aim for automated and real-time communication between different systems. This solution prevents the implementation of a periodic synchronization by listening for specific events in the DevOps platform and notifying the registered systems. A webhook is essentially a user-defined HTTP callback that subscribes to specific events. Whenever a change occurs to a DevOps work item, a notification is automatically sent to our API. This process is activated without the need for manual intervention, enabling efficient and up-to-date synchronization between Teams, OPAL and DevOps. The use of DevOps webhooks in the sync tool brings the same benefits as the SharePoint webhooks, disabled [8.6.1 (SharePoint Webhook) Operation] and contributes to the quality and reliability of the tool. Using the DevOps webhooks is a very suitable solution for receiving and processing changed DevOps notifications. Manage subscription Because both SharePoint and Azure DevOps are from the Microsoft company, managing a DevOps webhook works very similar to a SharePoint webhook, but Azure offers a more diverse range of webhooks. While SharePoint can only listen to the creation and modification of Teams notifications, with DevOps it is possible to listen to development-related actions (e.g.: code pushed, pull request created, build completed, release created), but also to a notification list. To create a webhook, DevOps expects a resource on which the subscription must be created, in our case a notification list. It also expects the specification of the entity and modification type that the subscription should listen to and a URL where the notification should be sent. Our sync tool currently only supports the ability to sync updating and deleting DevOps notifications and we choose this as the type. Unlike SharePoint webhooks, DevOps webhooks have no expiration date and the presence of a job service for renewing existing subscriptions is not applicable. Our tool requires that the project for which the webhook subscription is created has a linked Teams project, because receiving notifications that cannot be synchronized anywhere is useless. In addition to creating a DevOps webhook subscription, the API also supports retrieving the presence or removing subscriptions. These actions can be invoked from the front-end application through the use of a switch allowing the user to easily manage the DevOps subscriptions for OPAL projects. Processing changes [Processing of changes] Webhook-loop prevention Problem Webhooks are called when a change occurs to a resource that has a subscription added. In our case, this is when a notification is created, modified or deleted. The webhook sends a notification to the API and it will synchronize the notification to the other platform. Imagine a scenario where we have a Teams and DevOps with synchronization to and from the platforms. This means that when changing a Teams notification, the Teams webhook triggers and the API sends a notification. The sync tool will process the change and adjust the associated DevOps notification. The DevOps webhook then triggers and sends a notification to the API, after which our sync tool adjusts the corresponding Teams notification and triggers the Teams webhook and we end up in a loop. This loop will ensure that the same notifications are constantly updated without new information until it is interrupted by human actions or an overrun of required resources. Solution To prevent us from processing notifications of changed notifications by the sync tool, we must keep track of which notifications have been modified by the tool. When a notification arrives, as a result, we check whether the notification has been changed by the tool and ignore the notification. As an implementation, I added two tables: WebhookModifiedTeamsCalls & WebhookModifiedDevOpsCalls [7.1 Database Structure]. After processing a notification, a unique combination of the originating notification list & the notification number is stored here. When a notification is received, the table is searched for the presence of the notification information and, if found, it is removed from the table and the sync tool will ignore the notification. The reason why it needs to be removed is because the next time the notification is possibly updated by a user we want to synchronize this modification. Advanced Functionalities DevOps Sync Target Location One of the advanced features that has been added to the synchronization tool is the option to specify per OPAL project where the notifications should end up in DevOps. For example, in the “Edit Teams & DevOps” screen, a user can choose from a list of DevOps Area & Iteration locations that are persisted in the database. These locations are retrieved externally from DevOps based on the chosen OPAL project (Swagger response example shown in [Figure 7 - Swagger Example GetAreaPaths]). This way we ensure that the data chosen by the user is valid.","completion":"**Positive Aspects:** 1. **Adoption of DevOps Webhooks**: Utilizing DevOps webhooks to facilitate real-time updates for changes in work items indicates a solid understanding of efficient system-to-system communication.

This solution prevents the implementation of a periodic synchronization by listening for specific events in the DevOps platform and notifying the registered systems. A webhook is essentially a user-defined HTTP callback that subscribes to specific events. Whenever a change occurs to a DevOps work item, a notification is automatically sent to our API. This process is activated without the need for manual intervention, enabling efficient and up-to-date synchronization between Teams, OPAL and DevOps. The use of DevOps webhooks in the sync tool brings the same benefits as the SharePoint webhooks, disabled [8.6.1 (SharePoint Webhook) Operation] and contributes to the quality and reliability of the tool. Using the DevOps webhooks is a very suitable solution for receiving and processing changed DevOps notifications. Manage subscription Because both SharePoint and Azure DevOps are from the Microsoft company, managing a DevOps webhook works very similar to a SharePoint webhook, but Azure offers a more diverse range of webhooks. While SharePoint can only listen to the creation and modification of Teams notifications, with DevOps it is possible to listen to development-related actions (e.g.: code pushed, pull request created, build completed, release created), but also to a notification list. To create a webhook, DevOps expects a resource on which the subscription must be created, in our case a notification list. It also expects the specification of the entity and modification type that the subscription should listen to and a URL where the notification should be sent.

However, this does mean that the user does not know when which notifications are synchronized because almost everything happens in the back-end and only errors are sent to the user. To give the user more control over the synchronization and make using this functionality easy, I have added a SharePoint ListView CommandSet Extension. A CommandSet Extension offers the possibility to extend the functionality of SharePoint lists with your own business logic and can be added to both the tool bar and context menu. (Nachan, 2018) As extra functionality I have added two commands. The first command (“Sync calls to DevOps\\") is able to manually initiate synchronization of the open SharePoint list. This calls the same API as a SharePoint WebHook would, but now we fabricate a notification as if the webhook has been triggered. To provide insights into the results of the actions performed by the user, the extension is equipped with dialogs that can show feedback to the user.","completion":"**Positive Feedback:** 1. **User Control and Insight**: The addition of a SharePoint ListView CommandSet Extension is a strong feature that grants users more visibility and control over the synchronization process.

This prevents a Teams notification from being found when synchronizing the DevOps notification and ensures data consistency. One problem we are encountering here is that based on the change we cannot retrieve the Teams notification from the Teams list because it has been deleted. As a result, we also do not know the number of the associated DevOps notification. One way to look up the DevOps notification is to look for a combination of the ID of the Teams notification and the unique URL of the notification in the DevOps projects linked to the Teams list. Processing a deleted Teams call is visualized in [Figure 5 - Activity Diagram Processing Deletion Teams call]. After the change is successfully processed, we need to save the DevOps notification data to the WebhookModifiedDevOpsCalls database table to ignore the new item's webhook notification and prevent the webhook loop. We will also need to update the LatestTeamsChangeToken for the OPAL projects for which notifications have been processed. By updating this token we assure the user that when calling the webhook later, only the new changes will be retrieved.","completion":"**Feedback on the Deletion Section of the Synchronization Process:** **Positive Aspects:** 1. **Data Consistency Focus**: The process you described for handling deletions prioritizes data consistency, which is a vital aspect of maintaining data integrity across synced platforms.

To choose a platform for hosting, this was discussed with the internship supervisor to determine whether there were any preferencescompanyY for the platform to be used to host the code. Considering that there is insidecompanyY Knowledge in particular lies with the services of AWS and Azure is preferred for these platforms. In addition, both AWS and Azure already had environments ready for the trainees to use. Based on preference for AWS or Azure, I decided to use AWS. This choice was made because GitLab's CI/CD pipelines fit better with AWS than with Azure. Furthermore, the code to be hosted is not written in a Microsoft-developed framework such as .NET, which would make the Azure platform more suitable. In addition, the range of services within both AWS and Azure seemed comparable. Frontend To find a suitable service from the selection, I asked for advice on selecting a number of options that might be suitable for hosting the Frontend. After receiving the various services, the pros and cons were weighed up. The following AWS products were recommended for hosting the Frontend: S3 Bucket Aws Amplify EC2 After researching the different platforms, the most suitable platform was S3, a platform made for storing static files including images, videos and text files. However, it can also be used to host static websites, the Vue application can be built after which the website consists of HTML and JavaScript files. Since the Vue frontend of the application is a client side application, this was a suitable service for hosting the frontend. AWS amplify was not the ideal solution as it added features that were not needed. An EC2 instance was an unsuitable option as payment had to be made per hour that the website is online, as the website must always be accessible to users, this was not a suitable choice compared to the other solutions as the costs are considerably higher than other hosting options. Since it is essential to ensure the security of the application, it is necessary to enable the application to function with HTTPS (NFR5, NFR6, NFR7). Additionally, the HTTPS protocol is required to access certain Web APIs used in the application. To make the application available as a Progressive Web App (PWA), the website must run on HTTPS before the application can be installed as a standalone application Network, 2023. To run the application under HTTPS, the use of Cloudfront is necessary, as S3 -buckets only support the HTTP protocol. Cloudfront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service from AWS. See figure 27 for a flow of the services required for this approach. Figure 27: AWS services Backend Selecting the right AWS services to host a Golang backend is crucial to creating a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective architecture. To make my research into the AWS services more focused, I was also asked for advice on selecting the services that might be a suitable solution for hosting the backend of the application. The following services were recommended to look into. Lightsail EC2 ECR Scaling the application can be done based on how heavily an instance is loaded. If an instance is heavily loaded, multiple instances can be placed next to each other so that the application scales horizontally. This can be done, for example, with an EC2 instance. Horizontal scaling is more cost-effective than vertically scaling the application given that the cost of a larger server is not necessarily more cost-effective as the cost of more powerful hardware does not necessarily increase linearly Li et al., 2020. Given the relatively low number of requests, it is not important that many instances have to be located next to each other, but the use of an auto-scaling group (ASG) still has advantages, e.g. monitoring the running instances if the service goes offline a new service has been put back online. However, given the costs, it was not decided not to use the functionality","completion":"**Feedback on the Hosting Section:** **Positive Aspects:** 1. **Platform Selection Process**: Your methodical approach to platform selection demonstrates a strategic assessment process. Collaborating with your internship supervisor and considering companyY's internal knowledge highlights due diligence. 2. **Consideration of CI/CD Pipelines**: Factoring in how AWS complements GitLab's CI/CD pipelines underscores the importance of selecting a hosting platform that aligns with the project's development and deployment practices. 3. **Detailed Analysis of Frontend Hosting Options**: The comprehensive review of each AWS service's pros and cons for frontend hosting shows a commitment to finding the most suitable and cost-effective solution. Settling on S3 due to its compatibility with static sites and analysis of alternative options, including AWS Amplify and EC2, exemplifies informed decision-making. 4. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Your recognition of the necessity for HTTPS and its implementation using Cloudfront shows an understanding of security best practices and technical requirements for a PWA. 5. **Backend Infrastructure Evaluation**: The consideration of backend hosting solutions, such as Lightsail, EC2, and ECR, and the rationale behind the chosen method is well-articulated.

The digital era has brought about a rich data environment, transforming the way businesses engage with diverse consumer populations. In this report, we provide a thorough analysis of conventional segmentation and targeting methods in today's world, focusing specifically on the brand Durex Condoms by Reckitt. Traditional marketing theories have long emphasised the importance of segmentation and targeting in creating successful marketing campaigns (Kotler & Keller, 2016). Through segmenting the market and understanding target audiences, companies can customise their messaging and products to align with the unique needs and desires of customers (Armstrong et al., 2020). Nevertheless, as analytics and digital platforms have become more prevalent, consumer behaviour has become increasingly dynamic and harder to anticipate. Therefore, the purpose of this report is twofold: Firstly, to evaluate the validity of segmentation and targeting through a survey of scholarly discourse (Smith & Collins, 2020). Furthermore, we can creatively integrate marketing strategies customised for the distinct consumer profiles developed for Durex Condoms—embodied by the carefully constructed personas of David, Laura, Emily, and John. Finally, in order to establish the connection between these strategies and consumer behaviour theories, it is important to support all suggested tactics with a wide range of academic foundations (Solomon et al., 2021). Placing the discussion in an academic context means recognising the viewpoints of modern scholars who suggest subtle changes to the traditional paradigms, keeping up with technology and market trends (Hennig-Thurau et al., 2012; Shankar & Batra, 2021). The dynamic relationship between historical insights and contemporary perspectives allows for a deeper comprehension of the importance of segmentation and targeting in the present day. There have been ongoing criticisms suggesting that conventional marketing frameworks need to adapt in order to stay relevant (Porter, 2020). Reflecting this viewpoint, the extensive analysis presented here not only offers a rigorous intellectual pursuit but also aims to connect traditional marketing ideology with the needs of the modern marketplace. The following sections of this report will break down, examine, and improve these traditional marketing concepts to better suit the current challenges faced by Reckitt's Durex Condoms, aiming to achieve a combination of academic rigour and practical effectiveness. Traditional Segmentation and Targeting In Mordern Era Marketing strategy relies on segmentation and targeting to target the right customers (Kotler & Armstrong, 2020). Market segmentation divides consumers with similar needs, preferences, or traits into smaller groups. However, targeting involves strategically choosing specific segments to market to (Weinstein, 2021). These ideas have helped businesses understand and meet market segment needs in the past (McDonald & Dunbar, 2022). However, with market competition rising and consumer preferences changing, traditional segmentation and targeting methods must be reconsidered. Sceptics argue that the rapid pace of technological advancements and the abundance of data require a more agile and current approach to understanding and interacting with consumers (Holt et al., 2020). With the evolution of the marketing landscape, traditional segmentation and targeting methodologies have come under increased scrutiny. In the fields of marketing, esteemed authors like Kotler and Keller (2016) have emphasised the importance of these strategies in effectively communicating an organization's value proposition to the intended audience. Nevertheless, modern scholars contend that these frameworks may face challenges in fully understanding the intricacies of today's consumers, whose behaviour is marked by swift shifts and intricate dynamics (Holt et al., 2021). Traditional segmentation methods used to depend on factors like demographics, geography, psychographics, and behaviour to categorise consumers (Weinstein, 2021). This approach enabled marketers to create tailored messages for specific customer segments, who are perceived to have similar desires and requirements (Smith & Collins, 2020). However, some critics have pointed out the evolving complexity of consumer journeys, challenging the traditional categorizations of the past. There has been a reevaluation of how groups are categorised based on stereotypes, leading to a shift towards a more personalised and data-driven approach that relies on real-time information and predictive analytics (Holt et al., 2021). The targeting process has also experienced significant changes. Traditional targeting methods frequently recommended a uniform solution for each segment. Nevertheless, thanks to the rise of big data analytics and artificial intelligence, the possibility of personalised targeting has grown significantly. This has led to a greater demand for tailored solutions that cater to the needs of individual consumers in real-time (Shankar & Batra, 2021). This transition from a \\"broadcast\\" to a \\"narrowcast\\" mode of communication necessitates marketers to modernise their strategies and raises doubts about the effectiveness of broad-based targeting. In addition, the rise of digital platforms has given customers more power, leading to the fragmentation of markets and the emergence of niche micro-cultures that may not last long. The outdated approach of traditional segmentation, which focused solely on firms, no longer holds relevance in today's world. Consumers now actively participate in creating value and shaping their own identities, breaking free from the predefined categories set by marketers (Vargo & Lusch, 2017). Another perspective arises from academics who contend that traditional market segmentation remains relevant. In their study, Laud & Karpen (2021) argue that a thorough and thoughtfully designed segmentation strategy can provide valuable insights into the fundamental needs of consumers, even in a dynamic market. They argue that the problem does not stem from the basic method of segmentation, but rather from how it is implemented, which needs to be adjusted to take advantage of modern technology. When evaluating targeting, it's important to think about how traditional methods and modern ethical concerns interact. With the increasing focus on personalisation, there is growing debate about the intrusive and potentially excessive nature of personalised targeting. This brings attention to the issue of privacy concerns (Martin & Murphy, 2017). Brands like Reckitt's Durex Condoms must carefully consider consumer insights while maintaining discretion, ensuring that targeted strategies respect personal boundaries, a concern that is less important in traditional targeting approaches. In recent years, there has been a shift in marketing strategies. Instead of solely relying on market coverage and message repetition to enhance brand recall and persuade consumers, newer models prioritise relevance by fostering engagement and interaction (Chaffey & Smith, 2021). Companies have adapted to the changing needs of consumers by implementing consumer-centric strategies. They use tools like Customer Relationship Management (CRM) to build strong brand relationships and foster customer loyalty. This goes beyond just targeting customers and aims to create meaningful and satisfying experiences for them. In summary, although the concepts of segmentation and targeting are still relevant, their implementation needs to be updated to cater to the modern consumer in the digital age. Reaffirming Reckitt's position with its Durex brand involves preserving traditional wisdom while adapting it to meet the needs of today's consumers. Marketing Tactics In today's fast-paced and ever-changing market, crafting effective marketing strategies demands a blend of data analytics, creativity, and a thorough understanding of consumers. When implementing these strategies, companies like Reckitt's Durex Condoms need to not only analyse intricate consumer data but also demonstrate flexibility and responsiveness in their marketing endeavours (Kannan & Li, 2017). Ultimately, these strategies should be in line with a human-centered approach, making sure that every move connects with the target audience by using knowledge of behaviour and current consumer patterns (Holt et al., 2021). When it comes to Durex Condoms, effectively reaching out to David, Laura, Emily, and John means tailoring marketing campaigns to their unique needs and preferences. Instead, it is necessary to incorporate content that caters to the specific preferences of individuals, focusing on their interests in the environment, health, adventure, and reliability (Chaffey & Smith, 2021). Strategies can include eco-labeled product lines, wellness-focused educational content, adventure-themed partnerships, and evidence-based tech endorsements. These strategies are implemented through a multichannel approach that utilises social media, online forums, and targeted advertisements (Holt et al., 2020). Modern marketing tactics must be creative and adaptable, crafted with a deep understanding of the individuals they seek to connect with. Through tailored and adaptable strategies, Durex aims to engage and retain a wide range of consumers (Weinstein, 2021). This approach signifies a shift from the general methods of traditional marketing to a more refined and intricate approach to connecting with consumers. David – The Sustainable Advocate David, an individual with a strong environmental conscience, expects Durex's marketing strategies to highlight the brand's dedication to sustainability. Options could involve highlighting biodegradable packaging or backing environmentally conscious causes focused on conservation, which may resonate with David's interests (Smith & Zook, 2021). This approach would be most effectively communicated through channels that David frequents, such as environmental forums and eco-friendly blogs. It aligns with recent observations on the buyer behaviour of eco-conscious consumers (Cheah & Phau, 2021). The content should highlight Durex's efforts in assessing its lifecycle, showcasing a decrease in carbon footprint to reinforce its image as an eco-friendly brand. This will help solidify the perception among environmentally conscious consumers that Durex shares their values of sustainability (Hartmann & Apaolaza-Ibáñez, 2021). Laura – The Health Devotee When considering Laura's role as a human concerned with health and safety, Reckitt needs to create marketing material that emphasises Durex Condoms as a leader in quality and well-being. Messaging can highlight product innovation, like condoms made with hypoallergenic materials or reinforced for added protection, to showcase the brand's commitment to health-driven objectives (Bahl et al., 2020). Sharing health-related educational materials through wellness blogs and collaborating with health forums can be an effective way to catch Laura's interest. When combined in a cohesive marketing campaign, these elements reinforce Durex's brand as a symbol of health and safety, establishing a strong association with quality in Laura's mind as a consumer (Gurău, 2020). Emily – The Explorer of Excitement Emily's profile reflects an adventurous and experiential lifestyle, which aligns well with marketing strategies that emphasise diversity and innovation. For this persona, Durex could highlight its wide selection of products, capturing the essence of an intimate journey. Collaborative campaigns with travel influencers, like herself, sharing stories of safe and thrilling experiences in exotic destinations, could portray the product line as a catalyst for adventurous lifestyles (Voramontri & Klieb, 2019). Emily is drawn to social media channels, travel blogs, and interactive campaigns that celebrate choice and diversity. These platforms resonate with her sense of exploration and highlight the wide range of options available. They align with her desire for a fulfilling life filled with diverse experiences (Pentina et al., 2018). John – The Quality Seeker John's persona is focused on quality and reliability, which is crucial in software engineering. This calls for marketing strategies that highlight Durex Condoms as a trustworthy and top-notch product. Strategies such as utilising big data, incorporating trustworthy testimonials, or highlighting scientific endorsements can enhance the perception of brand reliability in John's mind (Malthouse et al., 2021). An online-focused strategy, utilising digital ads and tech forums, can effectively engage John. Highlighting product quality tests, detailed specs, and user reviews would appeal to his analytical mindset, strengthening the perception of reliability and excellence, thereby fostering trust in Durex Condoms (Kannan & Li, 2017). Connections to the personas' lifestyles are not just theoretical alignments; they are practical, actionable intersections where marketing meets life. By utilising content marketing, strategic partnerships, and immersive campaigns, Reckitt can embody the concept of understanding consumer behaviour and segmenting consumers based on their shared characteristics and behavioural patterns (Solomon et al., 2021). By understanding the inner motivations and social realities of individuals, the suggested strategies aim to go beyond the ordinary and make a compelling argument for the importance of marketing that focuses on personas in a dynamic and ever-changing consumer environment (Holt et al., 2021). Justification David's tactics are in line with Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, which emphasises the importance of environmentally friendly behaviours as expressions of self-transcendent values (Schwartz, 2012). This perspective explains why eco-centric marketing collateral strongly appeals to individuals like David, who base their purchasing decisions on their dedication to the greater good of society (Doran, 2010). Likewise, according to the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), people who are more inclined to critically analyse information will be more receptive to messages that align with their personal values. This is why sustainability-focused messaging is so effective for these individuals (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). Laura's strong focus on health aligns well with the Health Belief Model (HBM), which suggests that personal beliefs about health issues influence health-related behaviours (Rosenstock, 1974). Through a focus on product safety and health-conscious messaging, Durex effectively appeals to Laura's concerns about her well-being and the seriousness of the issue. This approach has the potential to encourage her to change her behaviour and develop loyalty towards the brand. Emily's marketing approach focuses on adventure and variety, taking inspiration from the Hedonic Consumption Theory. This theory explores how consumers seek pleasure, excitement, and sensory stimulation (Hirschman & Holbrook, 1982). By incorporating this theory, Durex can tailor their campaigns to appeal to Emily's innate need for unique experiences and exciting stimuli, thus creating a strong emotional bond with the brand. John's pursuit of quality and reliability emphasises the significance of cognitive consistency theories. These theories explain how consumers seek harmony between their beliefs and the information they receive (Festinger, 1957). Through the use of clear, reliable information and third-party endorsements, Durex effectively addresses John's desire for cognitive consonance, instilling confidence in the brand's trustworthiness and quality. Together, these theories of consumer behaviour form the foundation for Reckitt's strategies to effectively shape the decision-making process of different consumer groups. The strategies for Durex Condoms showcase a modern approach to marketing, incorporating both traditional and cutting-edge theories. These tactics are not only creative but also grounded in academic research and focused on meeting consumer needs (Solomon, 2020; Vargo & Lusch, 2017). With this application, Reckitt effectively connects academia and applied marketing, creating a strong connection with modern consumers that is both grounded in theory and adaptable to different environments. Personal Reflection Looking back on the module's journey, I've gained a deep appreciation for the delicate balance between traditional marketing theories and the flexible approaches needed in today's marketplace. Exploring important works like those by Kotler and Keller (2016) and Solomon et al. (2021) has not only deepened my understanding but has also prompted me to question traditional marketing ideas in the face of changing consumer behaviours. Segmentation and targeting are important aspects of personal development that involve understanding and applying them effectively. Being exposed to different consumer behaviour models, like the Theory of Basic Human Values (Schwartz, 2012) and the Health Belief Model (Rosenstock, 1974), has enhanced my understanding of consumer motivations. This understanding has fostered a thoughtful perspective, enabling me to better understand consumer personas and tailor marketing strategies to their unique stories. After reflecting on my experiences, I realise that my growth goes beyond just academic achievements. It represents an improvement in my strategic thinking, which is crucial in today's fiercely competitive business world. In addition, my ability to connect theory with practice has been greatly shaped by the module's focus on critical evaluation and practical application. My understanding of the delicate balance between consumer engagement and privacy concerns has been refined through the exploration of personalisation and ethical marketing strategies. This exploration has been done through the lenses of cognitive consistency theories (Festinger, 1957) and the ELM (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986). This expertise demonstrates my improved skill in navigating ethical dilemmas in marketing, prioritising consumer respect in all the strategies I recommend or implement. Dealing with modern challenges to traditional marketing frameworks has also improved my ability to adapt. Observing the conflicts between tradition and innovation, as explored by Vargo and Lusch (2017), has solidified my conviction in the importance of lifelong learning and the ongoing adjustment of marketing strategies. That's where I've grown from just absorbing marketing knowledge to actively engaging in critical thinking within the marketing discourse. Overall, the changes I've experienced in my personal and professional growth can be compared to shifting from rigid marketing frameworks to adopting a more flexible, consumer-centric approach. When I reflect on this module in relation to my academic journey, I realise that it has not only enhanced my analytical skills but also influenced the development of an ethical marketing philosophy. Through these academic experiences, I have grown as a marketer ready to make a meaningful impact on the ever-changing landscape of modern marketing. Conclusion This report thoroughly examines the conventional segmentation and targeting strategies used in the current marketing landscape, specifically in relation to Reckitt's Durex Condoms. The ever-changing digital landscape, with its tech-savvy consumers and constant flow of real-time data, has highlighted the necessity for marketing models to break free from traditional boundaries. Through a combination of theory and practicality, we have developed a strategy that revitalises traditional marketing principles using modern consumer behaviour theories. Durex's nuanced marketing strategies were explored and justified through the use of four personas: David, Laura, Emily, and John, who serve as archetypes. Building on academic foundations, strategies were customised to connect with the individual values and lifestyles of each person, highlighting sustainability, health and safety, adventure, and reliability as key elements. This approach has shown how marketing strategies can be both academically strong and aligned with diverse consumer narratives. Overall, the marketing strategies proposed for Durex Condoms are both academically sound and well-suited to adapt to the ever-changing marketplace. The module highlights the valuable insights gained from both academic and applied experiences, emphasising the power of reflective practice in modern marketing. This Report demonstrates the effectiveness of combining academic rigour with marketing innovation to connect with today's diverse consumer base.","completion":"I'm afraid I cannot provide exact references without access to the actual sources to verify them.

Протестантский канон, основанный на решениях Реформации в XVI веке, состоит из 66 книг - 39 Ветхого Завета и 27 Нового Завета. Этот канон отличается от канона Библии, принятого в православном христианстве, который включает 39 книг Ветхого Завета и 27 книг Нового Завета, а также дополнительные книги, называемые деутероканоническими или апокрифами. Деутероканонические книги в православной традиции включают такие произведения, как Тобит, Иудифь, Полная версия книги Есфири, 3 книги Маккавейские, пролог и дополнения к Даниилу и прочие. Они не признаны протестантскими церквами как священные и не включены в их канон Библии. Протестантские церкви отвергли деутероканонические книги по различным причинам, включая историческую неопределенность и недостаточное место, уделенное им в еврейском каноне Танах, на котором было основано Ветхий Завет. Также, реформаторы придерживались принципа \\"сола Scriptura\\" (только Писание), считая, что все доктрины их веры должны быть основаны только на Библии, без включения апокрифов.

Thaler explores non-standard models of behavior that differ from the classical economic model based on assumptions of rationality and selfish behavior. He examines how psychological factors, such as decision-making limitations, emotions, and social norms, influence the decision-making process. One of the goals of his research is to develop new models of economic behavior that incorporate more realistic assumptions about individuals and adapt to incomplete information and complex emotional states. He also aims to understand how these new models can be applied in practice, such as in the creation of political decisions and the development of social programs. Overall, Richard Thaler's research in Behavioral Economics aims to deepen the understanding of real human behavior in the field of economics and apply this knowledge to more effectively improve economic and social outcomes."},{"prompt":"Давайте попробуем разобраться в 5 фактах и узнаем, почему люди нарушают правила традиционной экономики и как на этом заработать. Обычный человек отличается от homo economicus Согласно экономическим теориям, человек должен ориентироваться на пользу от покупки товара, руководствуясь рациональным подходом. В действительности людьми движут незначительные факторы и когнитивные искажения. Суть поведенческой экономики Согласно теории перспектив, экономические теории бывают нормативные (логические) и описательные (работающие на самом деле). Классическая теория экономики сосредоточена на рациональных подходах. Согласно ей, человек обдумывает действия, проводит расчеты, думает наперед. Поведенческая экономика базируется на реальных поступках и мотивах людей. Счет в уме Обычному человеку сложно делать вычисления в уме. На эту когнитивную особенность направлены скидки и распродажи. Приятнее заплатить сумму 999, а не 1000, хотя существенной разницы нет. Магазины, торгующие товаром со скидками, зарабатывают больше, чем магазины с такими же ценами без скидок. Обычный покупатель оценивает не только пользу сделки, но и ее качество. С позиции homo economicus значение имеет только польза.","completion":"Let's try to understand in 5 facts why people deviate from the rules of traditional economics and how to profit from it. 1. Ordinary people are different from homo economicus: According to economic theories, individuals should make purchasing decisions based on rationality and the utility gained from the product. In reality, people are influenced by insignificant factors and cognitive biases. 2. The essence of behavioral economics: According to prospect theory, there are normative (logical) and descriptive (actually working) economic theories. The classical economic theory focuses on rational approaches where individuals carefully consider their actions, conduct calculations, and think ahead. Behavioral economics, on the other hand, is based on real actions and motives of individuals. 3. Mental accounting: Ordinary people find it difficult to perform mental calculations. Discounts and sales are designed to exploit this cognitive bias. It feels more pleasant to pay an amount of 999 instead of 1000, even though the difference is negligible. Stores that offer discounted products tend to profit more than those with the same prices but without discounts. Regular consumers not only evaluate the benefits of a transaction but also consider its quality, whereas for homo economicus, only benefits matter. 4. Anchoring effect: This effect refers to how people tend to rely heavily on the first piece of information (the anchor) they receive when making decisions. For example, if a retailer sets the original price of a product at 1000 and then offers a discount of 50%, customers perceive it as a great deal, even though the actual price of 500 might still be higher than the product's true value. 5. Social norms and influences: People's behavior is also influenced by social norms and the behavior of others. For instance, individuals might choose to donate to a charity because they saw their friends doing the same and want to conform to the social norm. Behavioral economics recognizes the impact of these social influences on economic decision-making. By understanding these behavioral factors and incorporating them into economic models, individuals and businesses can identify opportunities to profit from deviations from traditional economic assumptions."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

High school had become a realm of the predictable, a cycle of classes, homework, and the inescapable pressure of exams. Yet onscreen, he was a warrior, a hero in a fantastical realm where his choices mattered. \\"Kazuo, get off that thing and go to bed! You have school tomorrow,\\" called a voice, piercing the serenity of his haven. His mother, always punctual in her reminders of reality. \\"Just a few more minutes, Okaa-san,\\" he replied, without tearing his gaze away from the glowing monitor. \\"I'm about to level up.\\" The clock ticked past midnight, and his eyelids grew heavy, the screen before him blurring as he fought off sleep. It was then that the impossible happened. A sudden flash, like the burst of a camera, filled the room. He shielded his eyes with a forearm, feeling a jolt, an electric tingle that ran down to his fingertips. When he dared to look again, his room had vanished. Kazuo stumbled onto the grass, lush and inexplicably green beneath his feet, a stark contrast to his darkened room. His eyes took in the towering spires of a castle against a clear blue sky, the kind found only in the fantasies that fueled his nightly escapes. The scent of unfamiliar flowers mixed with the dust and stone of this magnificent citadel filled his nostrils. \\"What the—\\" His words evaporated as he stared at his hands, now clad in armored gauntlets. \\"Is this a dream?\\" Glances confirmed what he already knew to be impossible—in place of his school uniform, he was equipped in a warrior's attire, the weight of a sheathed sword resting against his hip. Before he could further process the situation, a scream pierced the air, snapping his attention to a nearby courtyard. Kazuo rushed toward the sound, feet carrying him with unfamiliar dexterity. He rounded a corner to find three male students surrounding a flustered, uniform-clad girl with striking violet hair that cascaded like a waterfall down her back. \\"Leave me alone!\\" she cried, pushing against one of the boys who leered close. \\"We just want to know if the rumors are true, Miyako-chan,\\" one grinned, reaching for the edge of her skirt. \\"Are you hiding something special under there?\\" Fire burned in Kazuo's chest, a righteous fury he'd never experienced. \\"Hey!\\" he shouted, striding forward, drawing the sword without thought. Its polished edge gleamed in the sun, an extension of his will. \\"Leave her alone, or you'll answer to me!\\" They turned, surprised expressions transforming into mocking smirks. \\"Well, look here,\\" one sneered. \\"Playing hero, are we? Let's see what you've got.\\" The world seemed to slow down as the foremost delinquent charged, fist cocked back. Kazuo's training from the virtual battles guided him—he sidestepped and swung the flat of his blade against the attacker's side, knocking the wind from his lungs. The boy crumpled to the ground, gasping. His companions hesitated, the thrill of the hunt soured by the taste of consequence. Miyako's violet eyes met Kazuo's with an intensity he could not fathom, a storm brewing within their depths. \\"You… you can wield a sword?\\" she stammered, disbelief etched in her delicate features. Kazuo, as shocked as she, could only nod. But before a word could be uttered between them, the skies darkened abruptly, and a deafening roar shook the very foundations of the courtyard. All heads turned towards the heavens to see a dragon—a creature of myth and legend—descending upon the school grounds, its scales shimmering with an ethereal light. Panic ensued as students scattered, but Kazuo stood riveted, sword in hand, an unknown destiny unfolding before him. The chapter ends with the dragon alighting before them, its massive form casting a shadow that enveloped both Kazuo and Miyako, its eyes ablaze with an intelligence that spoke of ancient wisdom and untold power. \\"What will you do now, warrior from another world?\\" rumbled the dragon in a voice that resonated through Kazuo's very bones. \\"Your true trial begins.\\" The creature's hot breath washed over them as the world held its breath, waiting for Kazuo's answer."},{"prompt":"выбери важное чтобы составить конспект и подправь если есть неточности, ибо текст брался с распознования с картинки ИСТОРИЯ ФОРМИРОВАНИЯ АТМОСФЕРЫ ЗЕМЛИ Необычной была и атмосфера. В AR. PR она была практически бескислородной. Заметное количество кислорода появилось, в конце протерозоя, как результат фотосинтеза растений. В атмосфере преобладали углекислота, водород, аммиак. Содержались также азот, сероводород, редкие газы. Атмосфера обладала восстановительным характером и меньшей плотностью. Естественно возникает вопрос: на основании чего можно делать такие выводы? Оказывается, что изучая реликтовые газы во включениях кварцевых пород, образовавшихся в океанах AR. PR, можно установить содержание газов в морской воде и состав атмосферы того времени. Такие исследования проведены учеными. Ю. П. Казанский, например, доказал, что в обломках кварцитов архейского возраста концентрация углекислоты равна 44,2%, кислорода 5,5%, редких газов 19,0%. В породах протерозоя эти значения соответственно равны: 34,5; 13,7; 51,8%; в палеозойских породах 7,6; 18,0; 74,4%. В современной же морской воде углекислоты содержится 3,2%, кислорода 34,1%, редких газов 62,7%. Отсюда следует, что от архея до наших дней происходит неуклонное увеличение в гидросфере и атмосфере кислорода и редких газов уменьшение углекислоты. КОМПЛЕКСОСАДКОВ И ПОЛЕЗНЫХ ИСКОПАЕМЫХ ТОГО ВРЕМЕНИ Специфика гидросферы и атмосферы архея и раннего протерозояопределила и своеобразный комплекс осадков и полезных ископаемых: широкое развитие получили кремнистые породы (кварциты и джеспилиты). Джеспилиты, или железистые кварциты встречаются в колоссальном изобилии в древних толщах, но практически отсутствуют в более молодых отложениях. Часто джеспилиты образуют высококачественные железные руды. Месторождения железа такого типа известны в районах Курской магнитной аномалии, Кривого Рога, в Северной Америке, в Африке. Содержание железа в таких рудах составляет до б2%. О масштабах железонакопления архея и раннего протерозоя можно судить по установленным запасам железных руд. Так, запасы древних руд оцениваются в 3000 миллиардов тонн, тогда как запасы железных руд последующих геологических эпох не превышают 135 миллиардов тонн. Среди осадочных пород раннего протерозоя сравнительно широко развиты известняки и доломиты. Интересно, что в древних толщах практически отсутствуют каменная соль, ангидриты, гипс. фосфориты. Причины этого пока полностью не выяснены. Остается добавить, что все осадочные породы архея и раннего протерозоя обломочного или химического происхождения. Отложения. образование которых связано с жизнедеятельностью растений или организмов (уголь, нефть. органогенные известняки и др.), полностью отсутствуют. Несмотря на большие масштабы образования осадочных отложений в древних океанах, они составляют лишь 40% от общего объема пород архея. В среднем протерозое их удельный вес уже достиг 80%6. Остальная часть приходится на долю магматических образований. •Это еще раз свидетельствует о том, что к среднему протерозою магматические процессы резка уменьшились, о чем можно судить по сокращению объема магматических пород с б0% до 20%.ПОЯВЛЕНИЕ И РАЗВИТИЕ ПЕРВЫХ ОРГАНИЗМОВ Изучая породы возраст которых превышает 3,2 миллиарда лет, ученые обнаружили в них образования сферической, нитеобразной формы. Размеры частиц не превышали 0,01 мм. Ученые полагают, что найденные образования представляют собой окаменевшие остатки одноклеточных морских водорослей. Похожие остатки водорослей и бактерий в породах сабсолютным возрастом 2,7-3,1 миллиарда летобнаружены в кремнистых и железистых сланцах Северной Америки, Центральной Африки и Австралии. Эти находки дают основание полагать, что к началу архейской эры закончилась химическая и началась биологическая эволюция. На основании находок можно предполагать, что уже в океанах архейского и раннепротерозойского возрастов господствовали простейшие одноклеточные организмы: бактерии, водоросли, грибы, простейшие животные. В архее происходит приспособление первых организмов к различным формам питания. Одни организмы усваивали в процессе фотосинтеза питательные вещества из воды, углекислоты и неорганических солей (автотрофные); другие - жили либо за счет автотрофов (гетеротрофные), либо питались разлагающимися органическими остатками (сапрофаги). Происходило деление органического мира на царство растений и царство животных. Враннем протерозое появились и первые многоклеточные организмы. Это наиболее примитивные формы. Кним относятся представители губок - организмы, ведущие прикрепленный образ жизни. минеральный скелет их состоял из спикул. Предстанители губок до сих пор населяют наши моря однако первые примитивные губки дошли до нас лишь в ископаемом состоянии. Несколько позднее появляются представители типа кишечнополостных. Представители кишечнополостных, дожили до наших дней и широко расселились в морях, океанах . Среди них хорошо известные нам кораллы, медузы, гидры.","completion":"Вот исправленный и уточненный конспект по истории формирования атмосферы Земли, комплексосадков и полезных ископаемых, а также появлению и развитию первых организмов: ИСТОРИЯ ФОРМИРОВАНИЯ АТМОСФЕРЫ ЗЕМЛИ: - Атмосфера Земли в архейском периоде (Archean, AR.

От окружающей человека среды (природные условия, условия на рабочем месте, жилищные условия) зависит продолжительность жизни, здоровье, уровень заболеваемости и др. Нормирование качества окружающей среды - установление показателей и пределов, в которых допускается изменение этих показателей (для воздуха, воды, почвы и т.д.). ЦЕЛЬ НОРМИРОВАНИЯ - установление предельно допустимых норм (экологических нормативов) воздействия человека на окружающую среду. Благодаря соблюдению экологических нормативов обеспечивается экологическая безопасность населения, сохраняется генофонд, осуществляется рациональное использование и воспроизводство природных ресурсов. Основные экологические нормативы качества и воздействия на окружающую природную среду: 1. Нормативы качества (санитарно-гигиенические): предельно допустимая концентрация (ПДК) предельно допустимый выброс (ПДВ) вредных веществ; предельно допустимый сброс (ПДС) вредных веществ. вредных веществ; предельно допустимый уровень (ПДУ) вредных физических радиации, шума, вибрации, магнитных полей и др. 2. Нормативы воздействия (производственно-хозяйственные): Нормативы предельно допустимых вредных воздействий, а также методы носят временный характер и могут совершенствоваться по мере развития техники сучетом международных стандартов. воздействий: их определения, науки и ПРЕДЕЛЬНО ДОПУСТИМАЯ КОНЦЕНТРАЦИЯ ВРЕДНЫХ ВЕЩЕСТВ Предельно допустимая концентрация вредных веществ(ПДК) это величина, характеризующая максимальное количество вещества, которое может находиться в определенном объеме измерений и не причинять ущербаживым организмам (в том числе, и человеку). Чтобы выяснить, что такое ПДК, необходимо определить, какие виды ее измеряются в разных средах и каковы их максимально допустимые уровни. … Поэтому особенно важно измерять ПДК вредных веществ в воде и атмосферном воздухе, поскольку именно влиянию этих сред подвергается основная часть населения ПОНЯТИЕ «КЛАРК» Количественную распространенность химических элементов в земной коре впервые установил Ф. У. Кларк. В земную кору он включал также гидросферу и атмосферу. Поскольку масса гидросферы составляет лишь несколько процентов, а атмосферы - сотые доли процента от массы твердой земной коры (ЗК), поэтомучисла Кларка в основном отражают состав ЗК. Отдавая должное Кларку, свыше 40 лет посвятившему этим исследованиям, А. Е. Ферсман в 1923 г. предложил подтермином «КЛАРК» понимать среднее содержание химического элемента в земной коре, какой-либо ее части, Земле в целом, в планетахи других космических объектах. ПДК рассчитынают на единицу объема (для воздуха, воды), массы (для почны, пищеных продуктов) или поверхности (для кожи работающих). ПДК устанавливают на основании комплексных исследований. Значения ПДК, устанавливаемые на основании экспериментальных данных о токсичности и иных привходящих обстоятельств, не одинаковы в разных странах и периодически пересматриваются. Так, ПДК сероводорода в атмосферном воздухе при 24-часовом воздействии в Испании составляет 0,004 мг/м3, а в Венгрии - 0,15 мг/м3 (в России - 0,008 мг/м3). ПДК устанавливаются для среднестатистического человека, однако ослабленные болезнью и другими факторами люди могут почувствовать себя дискомфортно при концентрациях предных веществ (ВВ), меньших ПДК. Уровни ПДК одного и того же вещества различны для разных объектов внешней среды: ПДК сс - среднесуточное, ПДК ж.з. - жилой зоны, ПДК р.з. - в рабочей зоне, ПДК мр - максимально- разовое значение в воздухе, ПДК почв - в почве и др. В нашей стране нормативы ПДК разрабатываются и утверждаются органами санитарно- эпидемиологической службы и государственными органами в области охраны ОС. Значения ПДК включены в ГОСТы и другие нормативные документы. Нормативы качества окружающей среды являются едиными для всей территории РФ; их учитывают при проектировании технологических процессов, оборудования, очистных устройств и пр. СЭС контролирует соблюдение нормативов ПДК в воде водоемов хозяйственно-питьевого водопользования, в атмосферном воздухе и в воздухе производственных помещений; контроль за состоянием водоёмов рыбопромыслового назначения осуществляют органы рыбнадзора. С учетом природно-климатических особенностей, а также повышенной социальной ценности отдельных территорий для них могут быть установлены нормативы предельно допустимой концентрации, отражающие особые условия. По некоторым оценкам, 67% населения России живут в регионах, где содержание вредных веществ в воздухе выше установленной предельно допустимой концентрации. ПРЕДЕЛЬНО ДОПУСТИМЫЙ УРОВЕНЬ (ПДУ) ОРИНТИРОВОЧНО ДОПУСТИМЫЙ УРОВЕНЬ (ОДУ) ОРИНТИРОВОЧНО ДОПУСТИМАЯ КОНЦЕНТРАЦИЯ (ОДК) Это максимальный уровень влияния радиации, шума, вибрации, магнитныхполей и иныхвредныхфизическихвоздействий, который не представляетопасностидля здоровья человека, состояния животных, растений, ихгенетического фонда. ПДУ - это то же, что ПДК, но для физических воздействий. Например, предельно допустимый уровень радиационного воздействия определяется на основании норм радиационной безопасности, основных санитарных норм и санитарных норм проектирования В тех случаях, когда ПДК или ПДУ не определены и находятся только на стадии разработки, используюттакие показатели, как ОДК - ориентировочно допустимая концентрация, или ОДУ - ориентировочно допустимый уровень соответственно. ИОНИЗИРУЮЩЕЕ ИЗЛУЧЕНИЕ Ионизирующее излучение - это вид энергии, высвобождаемой атомами в форме электромагнитных волн (гамма- или рентгеновского излучения) или частип (нейтроны, бета или альфа). Спонтанный распад атомов называется радноактивностью, а избыток возникающей при этом энергии является формой понизирующего излучения При альфа-излученни Ra-226 переходит Rn-222 и его удельное количество с поверхности грунта на участке планируемой застройки измеряется в Бк/кв_м./с., те. активность (1 распад/с)/на площадь/время. Это и называется плотность потока радона (ШПР). Основным признаком потенциальной радоноопасности земельных участков является ППР в пределах контура проектируемых объектов строительства. Если расположение контуров проектируемых объектов на участке не определено (предпроектная стадия), то сеть контрольных точек выбирается равномерно по всему участку с целью предварительной оценки радоноопасности. Если по результатам обследования на поверхности грунта значительное количество контрольных точек имеют превышения, то окончательную оценку соответствия участка требованиям санитарных правил и гигиенических нормативов по данному показателю принимают с учетом результатов определения ППР на отметке заложения подошвы фундамента.","completion":"Конспект по теме \\"Нормирование качества окружающей среды\\" может быть сформулирован таким образом: 1.

Поведенческая теория жизненного цикла гласит, что получив инвестиции от денег, вкладчик охотнее продолжит инвестировать их дальше. Экономисты против этики Люди с экономическим образованием чаще нарушают этические нормы, так как поступают согласно законам экономики. Решения, основанные на нормативной теории, часто приводят бизнес к краху, так как не учитывают восприятие обычных людей.","completion":"Weak willpower A person is driven by two desires - to seek immediate pleasure and to plan for the future.

Named pipes can be used to facilitate communication between an Autodesk Revit application and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model if you're implementing some custom solution where the RL model interacts with Revit, potentially for tasks like optimizing design parameters or automating certain workflows. Here's how you could set up named pipes for communication between Revit and an RL model: 1. **Establish Named Pipe Servers and Clients:** - Within the Revit plugin or any external application you're using, create a named pipe server. This server will be responsible for listening for connections from the client (your RL model). - In your RL model, implement a named pipe client that will connect to the server you've set up in the Revit plugin. 2. **Create a Named Pipe in .NET (C# example):** \`\`\`csharp using System; using System.IO.Pipes; using System.Text; // Server code NamedPipeServerStream pipeServer = new NamedPipeServerStream(\\"RevitPipe\\", PipeDirection.InOut); try { // Wait for a client to connect Console.WriteLine(\\"Waiting for client connection...\\"); pipeServer.WaitForConnection(); Console.WriteLine(\\"Client connected.\\"); StreamString ss = new StreamString(pipeServer); // Now you can read or write messages ss.WriteString(\\"Hello, Client!\\"); Console.WriteLine(ss.ReadString()); } catch (IOException e) { Console.WriteLine(e.Message); } \`\`\` 3. **Create a Named Pipe Client (Python example):** \`\`\`python import win32pipe, win32file, pywintypes # Client code def pipe_client(): quit = False while not quit: try: handle = win32file.CreateFile( r'.pipeRevitPipe', win32file.GENERIC_READ | win32file.GENERIC_WRITE, 0, None, win32file.OPEN_EXISTING, 0, None ) res = win32file.ReadFile(handle, 64*1024) print(f\\"Message from server: {res[1].decode()}\\") # Send message to server win32file.WriteFile(handle, str.encode(\\"Hello from client!\\")) quit = True except pywintypes.error as e: if e.args[0] == 2: print(\\"No pipe, trying again in a sec\\") time.sleep(1) elif e.args[0] == 109: print(\\"Broken pipe, exiting\\") quit = True if __name__ == '__main__': pipe_client() \`\`\` 4. **Integration:** - Ensure that the named pipe server within the Revit plugin is created and listening before the RL model attempts to connect. - Trigger the RL model to initiate the communication. This can be done on demand or automatically based on certain conditions or events within Revit. 5. **Security Considerations:** - Set appropriate security attributes for the named pipe to ensure only authorized processes can connect. 6. **Testing:** - Test the communication by sending messages between Revit and the RL model to ensure that both applications can send and receive data properly. This is a high-level overview of how to use named pipes for communication. Keep in mind that error handling, asynchronous communication, and concurrency control are important aspects to consider. In practice, you may need to create a more sophisticated protocol for message passing and handling. Additionally, this setup assumes that you have the necessary development experience and permissions to create plugins or external applications for Revit, as well as the abilities to encapsulate the logic inside the RL model. If you're working with complex data structures, you may also need to handle data serialization and deserialization when sending data through the named pipe."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Among the sea of black and navy uniforms, one stood out—a girl with a ribbon the color of twilight in her hair, a subtle act of rebellion in this regimented world. Her name was Aki, short for Akiko, and she walked with the unintentional grace of cherry blossoms caught in a gentle gust. \\"I keep telling you, Aki-chan, you’re gonna get in trouble with your fancy ribbons one of these days,\\" teased her companion, Haruto, as they made their way to Fujimori High School, a prestigious institution known for its rigid adherence to tradition and discipline. Aki smiled, her lips blooming into a mischievous curve. \\"It's worth it if it means I'm not another face in the crowd, Haruto-kun,\\" she replied, her voice a delicate balance between jest and earnest. One might consider Haruto her opposite—a boy who meticulously pressed the lines of his uniform trousers, whose hair was always combed to respectful perfection. Yet, there was a glint in his eye. A reflection of deeper currents beneath the calm surface. The chaos of the school grounds swallowed them, and it was in this torrent of adolescent energy that their routine began—the torrent they didn't know was their last in this world. --- In an unobserved corner of the school's ancient library, a book—a tome older than the dust that clung to its spine—hummed with an anticipation that trembled in the air. Aki, drawn by a curiosity that often eclipsed her caution, reached toward the leather-bound enigma, with Haruto a step behind, issuing a half-hearted warning. There was a spark, a surge, something primal and otherworldly that erupted from their touch upon the tome. And then, darkness swallowed them whole. --- Aki's senses returned to her as if they were molasses, heavy and slow, seeping through the recesses of her consciousness. A world spread out before her and Haruto, so similar yet starkly alien—a land painted with the broad strokes of feudal Japan and the vivid hues of fantasy. Disoriented, Aki clutched at her ribbons only to find them replaced by silken threads of a different, more opulent garment. Haruto stood beside her, looking down at his attire in muted astonishment—each now dressed in the elaborate robes of another world. \\"Where are we?\\" Aki's voice wavered, a stark contrast to her usual confidence. She examined the surreal landscape, noting the pointed peaks of unfamiliar architecture silhouetted against an orange-dappled sky. Haruto, ever the calm in the heart of chaos, tried to rationalize. \\"This must be... some kind of historical park, right? An immersive experience?\\" Even as he spoke the words, his doubt echoed in the vacant space that gnawed at him from inside. \\"A historical park wouldn't have that,\\" Aki said, pointing towards a cluster of figures at a distance, their demeanor nothing short of menacing—warriors in armor, with glinting steel by their sides and a predatory focus in their stance. Haruto took Aki's hand, a gesture that blended fear with the need to protect. \\"We should hide. Figure things out later.\\" Their flight was a scramble, a blending of adrenaline and confusion, leading them to the inconspicuous hideaway of an overgrown alcove. They held their breaths, listening to the thuds of armored footsteps growing near, then fading, a temporary reprieve granted by the scramble of shadows. Catching her breath, Aki turned to Haruto, her eyes reflecting the encroaching reality of their situation. \\"Haruto-kun, do you think we're in another world?\\" The question dangled between them, fraught with the gravity of their plight. Haruto opened his mouth to answer, but before he could utter a single syllable, the ground beneath them gave a violent shudder. The alcove wall slid away, revealing a hidden chamber. With a final, resigned glance at each other, they tumbled into the unknown—into light too bright, and a drama too deep to have ever been a part of their high school routine. And as the wall sealed behind them, sealing their choice away with the vanishing daylight, they realized this new chapter in their lives offered no ease of a return to the previous page. There was nowhere to go but forward, into the strange, enticing story that unwound itself before them—under the watchful eyes of beings unseen, entities biding their time, waiting to draw them into the heart of a perilous, entrancing new reality. The alcove closed with a rumble, and as darkness enveloped them, a voice, ancient and layered with untold power, echoed through the chamber, chilling their very souls: \\"Welcome, chosen ones, to the realm of Saisei.

First, you'll want to convert the average duration into seconds for easier calculation: 3 minutes = 3 × 60 seconds = 180 seconds 10 seconds is already in seconds. So the total for one song is: 180 seconds + 10 seconds = 190 seconds per song Now, you multiply this by the number of songs: 190 seconds/song × 12 songs = 2280 seconds To convert this back to minutes, divide by 60 seconds/minute: 2280 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute ≈ 38 minutes So, the cumulative time for all 12 songs is 38 minutes."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As for his independent work and songwriting style, there isn't a plethora of information available as of my last knowledge update in early 2023, but like many artists, Brotherkenzie's songwriting style could be reflective of his influences and experiences. In general, Wallows, the band in which Brotherkenzie performs, has a distinct indie-rock/pop style that blends catchy melodies with emotional lyrics and a touch of alternative rock and bedroom pop. Their music often features themes of youth, love, and the typical coming-of-age struggles, so it wouldn't be a stretch to suspect that Brotherkenzie's songwriting for any solo projects might carry some of these elements. Artists' solo projects sometimes diverge from their group's sound, exploring more personal or experimental sides of their creativity. To understand Brotherkenzie's songwriting style in-depth, one would typically analyze his lyrical content, melodic structures, chord progressions, and overall production choices in his solo works or contributions in songwriting. However, for the latest information on Brotherkenzie, his solo endeavors, and his songwriting style, I would recommend looking up recent interviews, social media updates, or listening to any latest releases as information could have evolved beyond my current knowledge."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Explain in detail step by step","completion":"Named Pipes is a method for inter-process communication (IPC) that allows separate processes to communicate with each other by reading from and writing to a common conduit. This is particularly useful when you want to integrate different pieces of software, such as Autodesk Revit and a reinforcement learning (RL) model, which might be written in different languages or run in different environments. If you want to set up Named Pipes for communication between Autodesk Revit and an RL model, you will typically have two separate processes: 1. A process that hosts the RL model (usually a standalone application or a script) 2. Autodesk Revit, which will run the add-in that communicates with the RL model Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to set up Named Pipes for communication between the two: # Step 1: Create a Revit Add-In 1. Start Visual Studio and create a new Class Library project for the Revit API using C# or any other .NET-compliant language. 2. Implement the add-in integration with Revit by following Autodesk's guidelines and their API documentation. 3. Implement the Named Pipe Server within your Revit add-in: \`\`\`csharp using System.IO.Pipes; using System.Threading.Tasks; public void StartNamedPipeServer() { Task.Run(() => { NamedPipeServerStream pipeServer = new NamedPipeServerStream(\\"YourPipeName\\", PipeDirection.InOut); pipeServer.WaitForConnection(); using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(pipeServer)) using (StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(pipeServer)) { writer.AutoFlush = true; while (pipeServer.IsConnected) { string input = reader.ReadLine(); string response = ProcessInput(input); writer.WriteLine(response); } } }); } public string ProcessInput(string input) { // Process the input received from the RL model. // For example, you might translate commands into actions in Revit. return \\"Processed information\\"; } \`\`\` # Step 2: Implement Your RL Model 1. Write your RL model in a language of your choice, for example, Python. 2. Implement the Named Pipe Client to communicate with your Revit add-in: \`\`\`python import win32pipe, win32file import time def start_named_pipe_client(): while True: try: pipe = win32file.CreateFile( r'.pipeYourPipeName', win32file.GENERIC_READ | win32file.GENERIC_WRITE, 0, None, win32file.OPEN_EXISTING, 0, None ) break except: time.sleep(1) while True: # Send a message to the Revit add-in some_message = \\"Message to send\\" win32file.WriteFile(pipe, str.encode(some_message + \\"n\\")) # Wait for the response resp = win32file.ReadFile(pipe, 64*1024) print(\\"Received: \\", resp) time.sleep(1) # just for this example; in a real scenario, you'd likely react to the message instead start_named_pipe_client() \`\`\` # Step 3: Start Communication 1. Start your Revit add-in; it should start the NamedPipeServer when Revit starts. 2. Ensure your RL model script is started and the client tries to connect to the pipe that the Revit add-in established. 3. Once the connection is established, the Revit add-in and the RL model can communicate by reading from and writing to the pipe. Please keep in mind the following considerations: - Ensure that both the Revit add-in and the RL model have sufficient permissions to create and connect to pipes. - Error handling and edge case coverage are crucial for reliable IPC. - Named Pipes are Windows specific, if you need cross-platform compatibility, look into other IPC mechanisms such as TCP/IP sockets. - For production use, you should design a robust protocol for communication over the pipe, ensuring that both sides agree on message formats, error handling, etc. - This example handles text data. If you need to send binary data, you may need to handle encoding and decoding properly. With these steps completed, you should have a basic Named Pipe communication between Revit and your RL model. Fine-tuning and further development will be needed to create a robust and functional integration."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ответ округлите до тысячных.","completion":"Чтобы найти вероятность того, что первое орудие дало попадание, при условии что из трех орудий два снаряда попали в цель, необходимо использовать формулу условной вероятности, которая определяет вероятность события A при условии, что произошло событие B. В данном случае, событие A - попадание первым орудием, а событие B - два попадания из трех произведенных выстрелов. Обозначим события следующим образом: - A1 - попадание первым орудием, - A2 - попадание вторым орудием, - A3 - попадание третьим орудием. Исходя из заданных вероятностей: p1 = 0.66, p2 = 0.11, p3 = 0.24, вероятности промахов будут (1 - p1), (1 - p2) и (1 - p3), соответственно. Нам известно, что два снаряда попали в цель, а третий - нет. Это может произойти в трех разных комбинациях: 1) Первое и второе орудия попали, а третье промахнулось. 2) Первое и третье орудия попали, а второе промахнулось. 3) Второе и третье орудия попали, а первое промахнулось. Рассчитаем вероятность каждого из этих комбинированных событий: 1) P(A1 и A2 и ¬A3) = p1 * p2 * (1 - p3), 2) P(A1 и ¬A2 и A3) = p1 * (1 - p2) * p3, 3) P(¬A1 и A2 и A3) = (1 - p1) * p2 * p3. Теперь рассчитаем общую вероятность двух попаданий (событие B), которая является суммой вероятностей этих комбинированных событий: P(B) = P(A1 и A2 и ¬A3) + P(A1 и ¬A2 и A3) + P(¬A1 и A2 и A3). Подставляем значения вероятностей: P(B) = (0.66 * 0.11 * (1 - 0.24)) + (0.66 * (1 - 0.11) * 0.24) + ((1 - 0.66) * 0.11 * 0.24). Рассчитаем это выражение: P(B) = (0.66 * 0.11 * 0.76) + (0.66 * 0.89 * 0.24) + (0.34 * 0.11 * 0.24) P(B) = (0.05526 * 0.76) + (0.58674 * 0.24) + (0.008856 * 0.24) P(B) ≈ 0.042 + 0.1408 + 0.00212 P(B) ≈ 0.18492. Теперь вспомним, что нас интересует вероятность того, что первое орудие дало попадание при условии двух попаданий. Это будет сумма вероятностей первых двух комбинаций, так как в обеих из них первое орудие дает попадание: P(A1 | B) = P(A1 и A2 и ¬A3) + P(A1 и ¬A2 и A3) / P(B) P(A1 | B) = [(0.66 * 0.11 * 0.76) + (0.66 * 0.89 * 0.24)] / 0.18492. Рассчитаем числитель: (0.66 * 0.11 * 0.76) + (0.66 * 0.89 * 0.24) ≈ 0.042 + 0.1408 ≈ 0.1828 Теперь подставляем числитель и знаменатель в формулу условной вероятности: P(A1 | B) ≈ 0.1828 / 0.18492. Выполним деление: P(A1 | B) ≈ 0.9890 Округлим ответ до тысячных: P(A1 | B) ≈ 0.989.

O DNS é um sistema que traduz nomes de domínio, que são fáceis de serem lembrados pelos humanos (como www.google.com), em endereços IP numéricos (como 172.217.168.206), que são necessários para que os dispositivos se localizem e se comuniquem na Internet. Quando você tenta acessar um site no seu dispositivo Android, aqui está como o DNS afeta a velocidade de carregamento: 1. **Resolução de Nomes**: Cada vez que você digita um endereço de site ou clica em um link, seu dispositivo utiliza o DNS para resolver o nome do domínio para o endereço IP correspondente. Se o servidor DNS que você está usando é lento ou está com problemas, haverá um atraso antes que o seu dispositivo possa começar a carregar o site. 2. **Cache de DNS**: Os dispositivos Android, como outros sistemas operacionais, armazenam informações de DNS recentemente buscadas em cache. Se o site que você está tentando acessar já foi buscado recentemente, o dispositivo pode puxar o endereço IP do cache, eliminando a necessidade de uma nova consulta DNS e, portanto, acelerando o processo de carregamento. 3. **Disponibilidade e Distância do Servidor DNS**: Se o servidor DNS estiver off-line ou sofrer de problemas de desempenho, o processo de resolução de nomes será impactado, levando a atrasos no carregamento de páginas da web. Além disso, servidores DNS mais distantes podem ter tempos de resposta mais longos, o que também pode diminuir a velocidade geral de navegação. 4. **DNS Secundário ou Alternativo**: Se o servidor DNS primário falhar, o dispositivo terá que recorrer a um servidor DNS secundário ou alternativo. Isso pode adicionar atraso adicional antes que as páginas da web comecem a carregar. 5. **DNS Over HTTPS (DoH) ou DNS Over TLS (DoT)**: Algumas das tecnologias mais recentes envolvem criptografar solicitações de DNS (com DoH ou DoT) para aumentar a privacidade e a segurança. Embora essas camadas adicionais de segurança sejam benéficas, elas podem ocasionalmente adicionar uma pequena quantidade de latência ao processo de resolução de DNS. Para otimizar o impacto do DNS na velocidade da Internet em um dispositivo Android, você pode: - **Alterar o servidor DNS**: Usar servidores DNS rápidos e confiáveis, como o Google DNS (8.8.8.8 e 8.8.4.4) ou Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1), pode melhorar a velocidade de resolução de nomes. - **Usar servidores DNS locais**: Optar por servidores DNS mais próximos da sua localização geográfica pode reduzir a latência. - **Manter o sistema operacional atualizado**: As atualizações de software muitas vezes incluem melhorias no sistema de cache e no gerenciamento de DNS que podem aumentar a velocidade geral de navegação na web. Lembre-se de que a velocidade da internet também é afetada por muitos outros fatores, incluindo a largura de banda da conexão, a qualidade do sinal de Wi-Fi ou dados móveis, a capacidade de processamento do dispositivo e a carga nos servidores dos sites que você está tentando acessar."},{"prompt":"mbti 유형은 얼마나 과학적입니까?","completion":"MBTI(Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) 유형은 개인의 성격을 분류하기 위한 도구로 널리 사용되고 있지만, 이의 과학적 타당성에 대해서는 논란이 많습니다. MBTI는 1940년대에 Isabel Briggs Myers와 그녀의 어머니 Katharine Cook Briggs가 Carl Jung의 심리 유형 이론을 토대로 개발했습니다. 이 검사는 개인의 선호를 네 가지 차원(외향(E) vs 내향(I), 감각(S) vs 직관(N), 사고(T) vs 감정(F), 판단(J) vs 인식(P))을 통해 총 16가지의 성격 유형으로 분류합니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 MBTI는 몇 가지 이유로 인해 과학적인 연구 커뮤니티에서 비판을 받고 있습니다: 1. 신뢰도: MBTI는 시간이 지나면서 같은 개인이 다른 결과를 얻을 수도 있으며, 일관성이 떨어질 수 있다는 지적을 받습니다. 즉, 한 개인이 반복해서 검사를 받을 경우 다른 결과가 나타날 수 있음을 의미합니다. 2. 타당도: MBTI는 성격의 연속성을 고려하지 않고, 사람들을 이분법적인 범주로 나눕니다. 예를 들어, 사람들은 완전한 내향형 또는 외향형으로 분류되지만, 실제로는 대부분의 사람들이 이 두 극단 사이의 연속선상에 존재합니다. 3. 예측 능력: MBTI 결과가 개인의 직업 성공이나 관계와 같은 중요한 생활 결과를 신뢰할 수 있게 예측하지 못한다는 연구 결과도 있습니다. 4. 연구 기반: MBTI는 과학적인 방법론을 통해 엄격하게 검증되지 않았으며, 많은 심리학자들은 임상적 활용이나 연구 목적으로 사용하는 것에 회의적입니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 MBTI는 팀 빌딩이나 자아 이해, 커뮤니케이션 개선을 목적으로 하는 비공식적인 맥락에서 널리 사용됩니다. 이 검사는 개인의 성격을 이해하고, 다른 사람들과의 차이점을 알아보는데 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. 그러나 MBTI 결과를 개인의 능력이나 성격을 완벽하게 반영하는 명확한 과학적 증거로 보기보다는 하나의 참고 자료로 활용하는 것이 좋습니다."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Эти дополнительные нормы установлены для обеспечения укрепленной защиты законных интересов и прав подрастающего поколения в связи с их уникальными социальными и психофизиологическими особенностями развития. На заре уголовного процесса против несовершеннолетнего акцентируется внимание на таких ключевых параметрах, как возраст осуждаемого, его дата рождения и гендерные особенности. Определение точного возраста осуществляется на основании начала новых суток, в 00:00, следующих непосредственно за днём появления на свет (согласно статье 421 Уголовно-процессуального кодекса РФ). [3] В последующем требуется тщательный анализ жизненных условий молодого человека, включая финансовое благосостояние его семьи, наличие личного пространства для сна и отдыха, а также соответствие уровня его обитания санитарным нормам и требованиям. В этот же анализ включается изучение влияния родителей или их законных заместителей на формирование личности несовершеннолетнего, его склонностей к привычкам, которые могут иметь разрушительный характер. Психологическая составляющая развития подростка также не остаётся без внимания. Рассматриваются навыки речи, логики, способность обучения, память, аналитические и когнитивные способности лица, которые соответствуют нормам его возрастной группы. Чрезвычайно важны и социальные аспекты — умение взаимодействовать с окружающими, строить межличностные отношения и интегрироваться в общественную среду. Особое внимание уделяется характеристике проведения досуга. Усиленные занятия в хобби и спорте могут снизить потенциальную вероятность попадания подростка в криминальную среду и вовлечения в преступную деятельность за счёт формирования полезных интересов и отсутствия свободного времени для неблаговидных занятий. Принципиальное значение имеет анализ взаимодействия подростков с взрослыми. В юном возрасте дети более склонны доверять старшему поколению, исходя из предположения о большем жизненном опыте взрослых, что может стать катализатором для манипуляций и злоупотреблений доверием. Психологическое развитие ребенка имеет критическое значение в ходе уголовного процесса, так как требуется определить, способен ли подросток осознавать значение своих действий и их незаконность. В случаях, когда у подростка отмечается задержка психологического развития, подкреплённая медицинскими данными, он может быть освобождён от уголовной ответственности. Например, если у подростка задержка развития на два года, и при этом минимально установленный возраст уголовной ответственности составляет четырнадцать лет, он не будет считаться полноценным субъектом уголовного преследования. Обширные исследования в области криминологии и уголовно-процессуального права неоднократно подтвердили необходимость учета самых разнообразных факторов при определении меры наказания для несовершеннолетних. Эти факторы можно классифицировать по трем ключевым направлениям: 1. Семейное воспитание включает в себя аспекты социальной роли подростка внутри семьи: наличие и личностные характеристики родителей, количество братьев и сестёр, материальные условия и нравственная атмосфера дома, а также другие компоненты, оказывающие прямое воздействие на эмоциональную среду и развитие личности. 2. Образовательная и трудовая сферы изучают положение несовершеннолетнего в учебной среде или на месте работы, его взаимоотношения с педагогами и коллегами, успехи в учёбе, поведение и умение зарабатывать самостоятельно. 3. Внеклассные и общественные мероприятия освещают активную деятельность несовершеннолетнего, его присутствие в различных социальных группировках и общественных движениях, а также его привычки проводить свободное время. Понимание и учет этих многочисленных факторов позволяет суду корректнее подходить к установлению уровня уголовной ответственности и назначению суммарного наказания для несовершеннолетних. При этом степень воздействия каждого из аспектов может варьироваться в зависимости от деталей индивидуального случая. Семейное окружение играет весомую роль в формировании характера и жизненных ориентиров ребенка, и может служить как источником поддержки, так и причиной конфликтов и страданий. Семья также есть фундамент для становления моральных устоев и правил поведения посредством воспитательного воздействия со стороны старшего поколения. Семейное благополучие — важнейший фактор, влияющий на вердикт по делу несовершеннолетнего преступника. Нередко именно неблагополучная обстановка в доме оказывается источником проблемного поведения молодёжи, подпитываемая невыгодным примером со стороны родителей и опекунов. Дело доходит иногда до точки, когда в семейном кругу преступная активность не только поощряется, но и стимулируется. Молодые люди, достигшие возраста, когда к ним может быть применено уголовное законодательство, имеют возможность осознавать общественную угрозу своих поступков и потенциальные последствия этих действий. Однако их личность ещё формируется, что делает необходимым учёт этих факторов в ходе уголовного разбирательства. Исследования в области психологии подтверждают, что эти лица всё ещё находятся на этапе становления своей индивидуальности. Применение стандартных мер уголовного правосудия может оказать неблагоприятный эффект на развитие характера и систему ценностей несовершеннолетнего. Поэтому первоочередной целью должно стать применение к детям уголовных мер, приоритетом которых являются воспитание и коррекция поведения. Такой подход поддержан Верховным Судом РФ в пункте 3 Постановления №1 от 1 февраля 2011 года [8], а также отражён в выводах многих учёных. К примеру, К.В. Калмыкова отмечает риски использования жёстких воздействий на несовершеннолетних, которые могут лишь усугубить проблему роста преступности среди молодёжи [13]. Уголовный процесс в Российской Федерации адаптирован под нужды несовершеннолетних за счёт введения специальных норм, освещённых в главе 50 УПК РФ. Определение «несовершеннолетний» применимо к лицам младше 18 лет, ответственность перед законом наступает с 16 лет, а в исключительных обстоятельствах — с 14 лет, как определено в статье 20 УК РФ. Из содержания статьи 421 УПК РФ следует понимание того, что даже после достижения возраста, с которого начинается уголовная ответственность, возможно неполное осознание своих действий молодым человеком, что требует от правоохранительных органов тщательного рассмотрения его личности и окружающих обстоятельств с учётом влияющих факторов. Уголовно-процессуальные нормы предоставляют возможность глубокого анализа уголовных дел, учитывая не только защиту прав подростка, но и обширное доказательство по делу. Участие в уголовном разбирательстве несовершеннолетних расширено до дополнительных участников процесса. Принципиальной важности придается присутствию защитника, как это предписано в статье 51 УПК РФ, чтобы обеспечить защиту интересов подростка на должном уровне, в то время как дискуссионным является вопрос специализированных адвокатов. Предложения касательно специализации адвокатов в области ювенального правосудия подчёркивают важность психолого-педагогической экспертизы. По словам А.В. Макаровой, такие изменения способствуют узкой специализации, но могут затруднить несовершеннолетним процесс выбора адвоката [18]. Согласно статье 191 УПК РФ в процессе необходимо участие педагога для лиц моложе 16 лет, но возникает вопрос об их компетенции из-за отсутствия ясных требований в законе. Федеральный закон об образовании [7] определяет педагогическую роль, но для целей уголовного процесса решающим фактором является способность педагога оказывать влияние на подростка. Хотя законодательство не выдвигает конкретных требований к судьям, занимающимся делами несовершеннолетних, Пленум Верховного Суда РФ рекомендует для таких дел более опытных судей с специализированной подготовкой [22]. Таким образом, уголовный процесс в отношении несовершеннолетних обладает своими уникальными характеристиками и, несмотря на проработанное законодательство УПК РФ, требует дополнительной доработки и усовершенствования. Поэтому пересмотр и усовершенствование системы учитывает потребность в дальнейшем уточнении и улучшении существующих подходов. Подростки, подлежащие уголовному наказанию, уже могут в достаточной степени осознавать социальный риск своих поступков и их последствий, но одновременно, согласно выводам специалистов в области психологии, большинство из них еще не имеет полностью сформированной личности. Применение общеустановленных процедур уголовного судопроизводства к несовершеннолетним может негативно сказаться на формировании их нравственных и волевых качеств, мировоззрения. В частности, уголовное судопроизводство в отношении несовершеннолетних должно в основном стремиться к достижению целей исправительного и воспитательного характера. Это утверждение находит подтверждение в позиции Пленума Верховного Суда РФ, изложенной в пункте 3 Постановления №1 от 1 февраля 2011 года [8], и подкрепляется мнениями многочисленных ученых в этой области. Так, К.В. Калмыкова подчеркивает, что применение строгих мер наказания к несовершеннолетним может только усугубить текущее положение и повысить долю детской преступности [13]. В связи с этими обстоятельствами в российском уголовно-процессуальном законодательстве были разработаны специфические нормы, облегчающие процедуры в отношении несовершеннолетних. Данный подход воплощен в Главе 50 УПК РФ. Уголовная ответственность в рамках этого законодательства наступает для лиц, не достигших возраста 18 лет, начиная с 16 лет и, по определенным категориям дел, с 14 лет, в соответствии со статьей 20 УК РФ. Анализ статей 421 УПК РФ позволяет сделать вывод, что законодатель признает неполноту сознания несовершеннолетних даже после достижения ими возраста, когда наступает уголовная ответственность. Важно, чтобы правоприменительная практика включала детальный анализ личности обвиняемого, его поведения, находящихся под влиянием как личных качеств, так и внешних факторов, как указано в статье 421 УПК РФ. Указанные статьи УПК РФ не только защищают интересы несовершеннолетнего, но и обеспечивают более всестороннее рассмотрение доказательств по уголовным делам. Уголовное законодательство предусматривает участие в процессе широкого круга лиц при рассмотрении дел, связанных с несовершеннолетними. Важным компонентом является защитник, чьё участие узаконено в статье 51 УПК РФ. Этот принцип подтверждает важность обеспечения качественной защиты прав подростков. В кругу специалистов обсуждается возможность введения специализированных адвокатов, работающих в сфере ювенальной юстиции, с психолого-педагогической подготовкой, что может помочь в решении конкретных вопросов данных дел. Противоречивость мнений по этому вопросу отражена в работах А.В. Макаровой, которая отмечает как положительные, так и негативные аспекты ввода такой специализации: с одной стороны, это улучшит качество защиты, но с другой стороны, может осложнить процесс выбора адвоката для несовершеннолетних [18]. Вторым выступает педагог для лиц до 16 лет, как того требует статья 191 УПК РФ. Но в практической сфере правоприменения поднимаются вопросы о его квалификации из-за нечеткости законодательных критериев. Федеральный закон “Об образовании в Российской Федерации” содержит определение педагогического работника [2], однако в контексте уголовного процесса важнее способность педагога оказывать реальное воспитательное воздействие на подростка, а не только наличие соответствующего статуса. Законодательство не устанавливает конкретные критерии оценки специалистов, что может привести к недостаточно эффективному выполнению положений статьи 191 УПК РФ. Кроме того, несмотря на отсутствие уголовно-процессуальных требований к квалификации судей, занимающихся делами несовершеннолетних, Пленум Верховного суда поощряет рассмотрение таких дел судьями с высокой квалификацией и специализированной подготовкой, как указано в постановлении от 1 февраля 2011 года №1[8]. Судейская специализация по делам несовершеннолетних подразумевает необходимость повышения их профессионального уровня через обучение и переквалификацию в различных областях, включая право, педагогику, социологию, психологию и технологии, применяемые в рамках процессуального законодательства. Таким образом, в судопроизводстве по уголовным делам, касающихся несовершеннолетних, существуют нюансы, превышающие рамки обычных процедур. Несмотря на сложное законодательное регулирование, закрепленное в отдельной главе УПК РФ, механизм судопроизводства недостаточно совершенен и требует дальнейшего усовершенствования и доработки для более эффективной защиты прав несовершеннолетних и обеспечения их успешной социализации в обществе.","completion":"Процедура рассмотрения уголовных дел в отношении несовершеннолетних представляет собой особую категорию судопроизводства, регламентируемую как стандартными положениями Уголовно-процессуального кодекса, так и совокупностью специфических правил. Эти дополнительные нормы установлены для обеспечения укрепленной защиты законных интересов и прав подрастающего поколения в связи с их уникальными социальными и психофизиологическими особенностями развития. На заре уголовного процесса в таких делах акцентируется внимание на таких ключевых параметрах, как возраст осуждаемого, его дата рождения и гендерные особенности. Определение точного возраста осуществляется на основании начала новых суток, в 00:00, следующих непосредственно за днём рождения (согласно статье 421 УПК РФ). [3] Требуется анализ жизненных условий молодого человека, включая финансовое благосостояние его семьи, наличие личного пространства для сна и отдыха, а также соответствие уровня обитания санитарным нормам и требованиям. Также анализ включает изучение влияния родителей или их законных представителей на формирование личности несовершеннолетнего и его склонностей к разрушительным привычкам. Психологическая составляющая развития подростка и его социальные аспекты, такие как умение взаимодействовать с окружающими, строить межличностные отношения и интегрироваться в общество, также не остаются без внимания. Важно учитывать, как подросток проводит свободное время, так как активное занятие хобби и спортом может снизить риск вовлечения в криминальную среду. Анализируется также взаимодействие подростков с взрослыми, их доверие к старшему поколению, и возможность манипуляций со стороны взрослых. Психологическоe развитие несовершеннолетнего имеет ключевое значение, в частности, осознание им своих действий и их незаконности. В случае задержки развития подросток может быть освобождён от уголовной ответственности. Исследования в криминологии и уголовно-процессуальном праве подтверждают необходимость учёта разнообразных факторов при определении наказания для несовершеннолетних. Они могут включать семейное воспитание, образовательные и трудовые аспекты, а также внеклассную и общественную активность. Семья играет характер в формировании моральных устоев и поведения, от семейного благополучия зависит вердикт по делу. Несовершеннолетние, достигшие уголовно ответственного возраста, могут осознавать последствия поступков, однако личность у них ещё формируется, поэтому к ним должно применяться уголовное правосудие с особыми мерами, направленными на воспитание и коррекцию поведения. Эта позиция подтверждена Пленумом Верховного Суда РФ [8] и мнениями учёных [13]. Уголовный процесс по делам о несовершеннолетних в РФ адаптирован через специальные нормы, освещённые в главе 50 УПК РФ. \\"Несовершеннолетний\\" - это лица моложе 18 лет с началом ответственности с 16 лет или, в исключительных случаях, с 14 лет по статье 20 УК РФ. Уголовно-процессуальный кодекс позволяет проводить глубокий анализ особенностей несовершеннолетних и учитывать влияющие факторы, как указано в статье 421 УПК РФ. Участие в уголовном разбирательстве над несовершеннолетними требует присутствия защитника и педагога для лиц до 16 лет по статье 191 УПК РФ. Обсуждается необходимость специализации адвокатов, а также компетенции педагогов при отсутствии чётких требований. Судебные специалисты по делам несовершеннолетних должны быть высококвалифицированными и иметь специализированную подготовку. В судопроизводстве по уголовным делам, касающихся несовершеннолетних, требуется дополнительная доработка и усовершенствование системы для обеспечения защиты прав несовершеннолетних и их социализации в обществе."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Игра очень похожа на традиционную игру в бинго. Правила следующие: 1. Игроки получают карточки с набором чисел в нескольких рядах. 2. Ведущий извлекает бочонки с номерами в случайном порядке. 3. Игроки отмечают выпавшие номера в своих карточках. 4. Победой считается полностью закрытый ряд, столбец или, в некоторых правилах игры, полностью заполненная карточка. 5. Игра имеет несколько туров с различными паттернами для победы. **Итальянское лото (SuperEnalotto)** – это лотерея, в которой участники выбирают числа в надежде угадать выигрышную комбинацию. Правила SuperEnalotto следующие: 1. Игроки выбирают 6 основных чисел в диапазоне от 1 до 90. 2. Во время розыгрыша извлекается 6 основных чисел, а также дополнительное число – так называемый \\"номер Jolly\\", который используется для повышения призов за угадывание 5 чисел. 3.

Pour clarifier, le script ne compare pas des extraits vidéo entre eux, mais plutôt des moments spécifiques à l'intérieur d'une seule vidéo, basés sur le volume sonore. Laissez-moi vous expliquer les principales fonctions et leur chaîne d'opérations : 1. \`calculate_loudness(audio_data)\`: Cette fonction calcule le volume de données audio en décibels. 2. \`find_loudest_moments(audio_filename, num_moments, segment_duration, video_duration, starting_offset, ending_offset)\`: Il s'agit de la fonction qui recherche les moments les plus bruyants à l'intérieur d'une vidéo. Elle renvoie deux listes, l'une contenant les moments (temps) eux-mêmes et l'autre contenant le volume à ces moments. 3. \`extract_segments(video_path, moments, segment_duration, video_duration)\`: Après avoir trouvé les moments clés souhaités, cette fonction va les extraire et les sauvegarder sous forme de segments vidéo distincts. Voici comment le tri fonctionne en particulier dans ce script : - \`ask_sorting_preference()\`: La fonction demande à l'utilisateur comment il souhaite trier les extraits vidéo basés sur les moments identifiés. - \`sort_moments(moments, volumes, choice)\`: Une fois que l'utilisateur a choisi une préférence de tri, cette fonction trie les moments et les volumes correspondants en fonction de cette préférence. Voici les options : - \`1\`: Trier par ordre de lecture de la vidéo (les extraits apparaîtront dans l'ordre où ils apparaissent dans la vidéo). - \`2\`: Trier par ordre inverse de lecture de la vidéo. - \`3\`: Trier par volume croissant (les extraits seront triés du moins bruyant au plus bruyant). - \`4\`: Trier par volume décroissant (les extraits seront triés du plus bruyant au moins bruyant). - \`5\`: Pas de tri. Le choix de tri \`3\` ou \`4\` est où la comparaison des volumes se produit, mais cela se fait à l'intérieur d'un seul fichier vidéo. Après le tri, la fonction \`extract_segments\` est appelée pour extraire les moments dans l'ordre où ils sont triés. En conclusion, chaque vidéo est traitée de manière indépendante. S'il y a plusieurs vidéos traitées par le script, chaque vidéo aura ses moments identifiés et potentiellement triés séparément des autres vidéos. Il n'y a pas de comparaison de volume entre différentes vidéos."},{"prompt":"Quand tu dis que cela se fait à l’intérieur d’un seul fichier vidéo, il s'agit de la vidéo d'origine ?","completion":"Oui, lorsque je mentionne que cela se fait à l'intérieur d'un seul fichier vidéo, je fais référence à la vidéo d'origine à partir de laquelle les segments sont extraits. Le processus décrit dans le code analyse le volume sonore de la piste audio de la vidéo d'origine, identifie les moments les plus forts (selon le volume) et les trie si nécessaire, avant d'extraire ces moments spécifiques comme clips vidéo individuels. Voici le déroulement pour une seule vidéo : 1. La piste audio est extraite de la vidéo d'origine. 2. La fonction \`find_loudest_moments\` inspecte cette piste audio pour identifier les moments avec les volumes sonores les plus élevés et les stocke dans une liste. 3. Selon le choix de l'utilisateur, ces moments peuvent être triés par volume (croissant ou décroissant) ou par ordre de temps (chronologique ou inverse). 4. Les segments vidéo correspondants à ces moments sont ensuite créés à partir de la vidéo d'origine, en utilisant \`extract_segments\`, en gardant l'ordre résultant du tri si celui-ci a été appliqué. 5. Ce processus est répété pour chaque vidéo d'origine que le script est configuré pour analyser. Pour résumer, chaque fois que le script gère le volume et le tri, il le fait en travaillant sur les données audio de chaque vidéo individuelle, sans comparer avec les données d'autres vidéos."},{"prompt":"Peut-on demander au script de trouver la pulsation de l'audio dans la vidéo extraite ?","completion":"Pour détecter la pulsation (ou le rythme) d'une piste audio, on utilise généralement une analyse de battement, ce qui peut être réalisé à l'aide de bibliothèques spécialisées. Le script Python présenté ne contient pas de fonctionnalité pour détecter la pulsation. Toutefois, vous pouvez intégrer une telle fonctionnalité avec des bibliothèques comme \`librosa\`, qui est couramment utilisée pour l'analyse audio et la détection des battements. Voici un exemple basique de la manière dont vous pourriez modifier votre script pour inclure une fonction de détection de pulsation en utilisant \`librosa\` : Tout d'abord, installez \`librosa\` si ce n'est pas déjà fait : \`\`\`bash pip install librosa \`\`\` Ensuite, vous pouvez ajouter la fonction de détection de pulsation à votre script : \`\`\`python import librosa def detect_beat(audio_path): y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, sr=None) tempo, beats = librosa.beat.beat_track(y, sr=sr) beat_times = librosa.frames_to_time(beats, sr=sr) return tempo, beat_times # Utilisez cette fonction dans le processus principal ou là où convient dans votre script. \`\`\` Puis, à l'endroit approprié dans votre script, vous pouvez appeler \`detect_beat\` pour trouver le tempo et les temps des battements de la vidéo extraite : \`\`\`python audio_path = 'path_to_extracted_audio.wav' tempo, beat_times = detect_beat(audio_path) print(f\\"Detected BPM (beats per minute): {tempo}\\") print(f\\"Beat times in seconds: {beat_times}\\") \`\`\` Soyez conscient que cette analyse pourrait ne pas être immédiate et que la performance dépendra de plusieurs facteurs, y compris la durée de la piste audio et la complexité du contenu sonore. Notez également que \`librosa.beat.beat_track\` renvoie le tempo (en battements par minute) et les indices de battements (\`beats\`), qui peuvent être convertis en temps réel (\`beat_times\`) à l'aide de la fonction \`librosa.frames_to_time\`. Le script Python initial devra être modifié pour incorporer cette fonction de détection des battements et gérer les résultats en conséquence. Vous pourrez ainsi récupérer l'information de pulsation pour chaque segment audio extrait d'une vidéo."},{"prompt":"Peut-on régler le seuil ? Comme avec audacity, ou on utilise un pourcentage de seuil de déclenchement ?","completion":"Oui, dans la plupart des analyses de battement ou de détection de seuil de signal audio, il est possible de régler un seuil afin de déterminer quelle amplitude sonore doit être considérée comme un battement. Cela est souvent utilisé pour éviter les faux positifs dus au bruit de fond ou à des pics de volume qui ne sont pas réellement des battements. Librosa, par exemple, utilise un algorithme d'estimation de tempo et de détection de battement qui choisit automatiquement un seuil adaptatif basé sur la distribution spectrale de l'énergie rythmique. Cependant, si vous souhaitez personnaliser cette valeur de seuil, vous devrez adapter le code et potentiellement utiliser des fonctions plus bas niveau de librosa. Voici un exemple simple de personnalisation du seuil dans librosa lors de la détection des battements : \`\`\`python import librosa def detect_beat_with_threshold(audio_path, threshold): y, sr = librosa.load(audio_path, sr=None) onset_env = librosa.onset.onset_strength(y=y, sr=sr) # Obtenez l'énergie d'attaque tempo, beats = librosa.beat.beat_track(onset_envelope=onset_env, sr=sr, trim=False, units='time') # Filtrez les battements en utilisant le seuil personnalisé beat_times_threshold = librosa.frames_to_time(beats[onset_env[beats] > threshold], sr=sr) return tempo, beat_times_threshold # Utilisez cette fonction dans le processus principal ou là où convient dans votre script. audio_path = 'path_to_extracted_audio.wav' threshold = 0.5 # Exemple de seuil, ajustez selon vos besoins tempo, beat_times = detect_beat_with_threshold(audio_path, threshold) print(f\\"Detected BPM (beats per minute): {tempo}\\") print(f\\"Beat times in seconds (above threshold): {beat_times}\\") \`\`\` Dans cet exemple, \`onset_strength\` est utilisée pour calculer l'énergie d'attaque, qui est une représentation de la manière dont la force des battements s'élève soudainement. Le \`threshold\` est une valeur que vous pouvez ajuster pour déterminer quels pics de l'énergie d'attaque seront considérés comme des battements. Cela est similaire à la manière dont on utilise un pourcentage de seuil de déclenchement dans des logiciels comme Audacity. Gardez à l'esprit que le choix des seuils peut dépendre fortement du type de musique, de son mixage et de sa qualité d'enregistrement. Trouver une valeur de seuil qui fonctionne bien pour tous les types de musique peut être difficile, et vous devrez peut-être ajuster cette valeur expérimentalement pour obtenir les meilleurs résultats."},{"prompt":"Où insérer cette partie ? audio_path = ‘path_to_extracted_audio.wav’ threshold = 0.5 # Exemple de seuil, ajustez selon vos besoins tempo, beat_times = detect_beat_with_threshold(audio_path, threshold) print(f\\"Detected BPM (beats per minute): {tempo}“) print(f\\"Beat times in seconds (above threshold): {beat_times}”)","completion":"L'ajout d'une détection de battement devrait être placé dans le script après qu'un extrait audio a été extrait et sauvegardé, et avant la suppression des fichiers temporaires si vous souhaitez traiter les extraits dérivés de la vidéo originale. Typiquement, cela devrait se faire dans la fonction principale (\`if __name__ == \\"__main__\\":\`) après l'exécution de \`extract_segments(video_path, moments, segment_duration, duration)\` pour chaque vidéo. Cependant, votre script actuel semble manquer d'une étape où les chemins des fichiers audio extraits sont conservés. Vous devez sauver ces chemins d'une manière ou d'une autre pour les utiliser lors de l'analyse de battement. Supposons que l'extrait audio est sauvegardé à un chemin accessible, voici comment vous pourriez implémenter la détection de battement : \`\`\`python # Après avoir extrait un segment vidéo et possiblement un audio associé. # Exemple de chemin vers un fichier audio extrait d'une vidéo segmentée. # Vous devrez générer ou avoir enregistré ce chemin au moment de la création du fichier audio. audio_path = 'path_to_extracted_audio_segment.wav' threshold = 0.5 # Exemple de seuil, ajustez selon vos besoins # Supposons que \`detect_beat_with_threshold\` est la fonction que vous avez définie suivant mes indications précédentes. tempo, beat_times = detect_beat_with_threshold(audio_path, threshold) print(f\\"Detected BPM (beats per minute): {tempo}\\") print(f\\"Beat times in seconds (above threshold): {beat_times}\\") # Vous pouvez stocker ces données ou effectuer des opérations supplémentaires ici. \`\`\` La fonction \`detect_beat_with_threshold\` devrait être définie quelque part ailleurs dans votre script pour être accessible à ce point-là. Vous devrez également vous assurer que pour chaque segment vidéo, il y a un fichier audio correspondant que vous pouvez analyser. Cela pourrait signifier la modification de votre fonction \`extract_segments\` pour également générer des fichiers audio ou l'extraction de l'audio des segments vidéo après leur création. Il est également important de mentionner que la détection de battement prendra comme entrée un fichier audio et non vidéo. Ainsi, si vos segments sont des fichiers vidéo, vous devrez extraire la piste audio de ces segments en tant que fichiers \`.wav\` ou un format similaire avant de procéder à la détection de battement. En résumé, l'analyse de battement doit être effectuée après l'extraction des segments audio depuis les segments vidéo et avant nettoyage final des fichiers temporaires."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
