B: If alpha bot gamma and beta bot gamma, this means that both planes alpha and beta are perpendicular to the same plane gamma.

When Little D loses a shoe at a point ((i, j, k)) where (i, j, k) are integers, he is effectively playing on the (i)-th point on the (x)-axis, the (j)-th point on the (y)-axis, and the (k)-th point on the (z)-axis simultaneously. 2. **Big Z's Move:** On the other hand, when Big Z munches a plane perpendicular to one of the coordinate axes, he affects only the points lying in that plane. For example, if he munches an (x)-plane (i.e., a plane perpendicular to the (x)-axis), he can only remove points from that plane. 3. **Unbounded Strings:** We define a string of marked points on a coordinate axis as \\"unbounded\\" if Big Z has not munched any point on that axis within (2n+1) distance of at least one endpoint of the string. 4. **Lemma:** Lemma: For any integers (m) and (l), Little D can create (l) unbounded strings of (m) consecutive points on a single coordinate axis. **Proof of the Lemma by Induction:** - **Base Case (m=1):** If (m=1), Little D needs to create strings of single points. - If Little D makes (lceil 1.5l rceil) triplet moves (one for each axis), ensuring that any marked points on the same axis are at least (5n) units apart, Big Z can potentially bound (munch) at most (lceil 1.5l rceil) strings since he can only bound at most one string in a single move. - Therefore, there will be (3 times ( lceil 1.5l rceil ) - lceil 1.5l rceil) remaining strings. Using the Pigeonhole Principle, at least (l) of these must be on the same coordinate axis. - **Inductive Step:** Assuming the lemma holds for (m), we need to prove it for (m+1): - By the induction hypothesis, Little D can construct (leftlceil frac{1.5 l (m+1)}{2} rightrceil) unbounded strings of length (m) on the (x)-axis. - Little D aims to create strings of length (m+1). He extends an existing string of length (m) on the (x)-axis and simultaneously starts building up new strings on the (y)-axis and (z)-axis. - Big Z, in (m+1) moves, can bound at most (m+1) of these strings. Thus, Little D can ensure that at least two additional unbounded strings of length (m+1) remain for every (m+1) moves. 5. **Main Proof:** - By the lemma, Little D can mark a string of (n) consecutive points on the (x)-axis. Consequently, he establishes (n) consecutive (xy)-planes containing points on the (z = k) line (for some fixed (k)). - Remarkably, Big Z cannot munch any part of these consecutive (xy)-planes containing such points once Little D has marked them. - Little D continues to lose shoes on these points, ensuring that his goal of marking (n) consecutive lattice points on a line parallel to one of the coordinate axes is met. # Conclusion: Little D can accomplish his goal for all ( n ).

The condition to be satisfied is: [ sum_{k=0}^{n-1} boldsymbol{e}_k = boldsymbol{0} ] This ensures that the sides close up to form a convex ( n )-gon. 2. **Reordering the Vectors**: It suffices to prove that, by reordering these vectors, we can obtain a set of vectors ( { boldsymbol{a}_1, boldsymbol{a}_2, ldots, boldsymbol{a}_n } ) such that: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} k boldsymbol{a}_k = boldsymbol{0} ] 3. **Factoring ( n )**: Since ( n ) is given to be not a power of a prime, it can be factorized as ( n = pq ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime integers (i.e., ( gcd(p, q) = 1 )). 4. **Constructing the New Set of Vectors**: Consider the set: [ { boldsymbol{e}_0, boldsymbol{e}_p, ldots, boldsymbol{e}_{(q-1)p}, boldsymbol{e}_q, boldsymbol{e}_{q+p}, ldots, boldsymbol{e}_{q+(q-1)p}, ldots, boldsymbol{e}_{(p-1)q}, ldots, boldsymbol{e}_{(p-1)q+(q-1)p} } ] where all indices are taken modulo ( n ). Note that this set includes each ( boldsymbol{e}_k ) for ( k = 0, 1, ldots, n-1 ) exactly once. 5. **Checking the Indices**: If ( xq + yp equiv x'q + y'p pmod{pq} ), then: [ x equiv x' pmod{p} quad text{and} quad y equiv y' pmod{q} ] This means in the considered set, each ( boldsymbol{e}_{k} ) is accounted for exactly once. 6. **Polygon Construction**: The vectors ( boldsymbol{e}_q, boldsymbol{e}_{q+p}, ldots, boldsymbol{e}_{q+(q-1)p} ), all emanating from a common origin, form a regular ( q )-gon. Their sum is: [ sum_{j=0}^{q-1} boldsymbol{e}_{q + jp} = boldsymbol{0} ] 7. **Rotational Symmetry**: Each set of ( boldsymbol{e}_k ) with the same ( k pmod{p} ) can be rotated by an angle ( varphi = frac{2pi}{p} ): [ boldsymbol{e}_k + 2 boldsymbol{e}_{k+p} + cdots + q boldsymbol{e}_{k+(q-1)p} = boldsymbol{b} ] This implies: [ (q+1) boldsymbol{e}_q + (q+2) boldsymbol{e}_{q+n} + cdots + 2q boldsymbol{e}_{q+(q-1)p} = q left( sum_{j=0}^{q-1} boldsymbol{e}_{q+jp} right) + boldsymbol{e}_q + 2 boldsymbol{e}_{q+p} + cdots + q boldsymbol{e}_{q+(q-1)p} = R^{varphi} boldsymbol{b} ] 8. **Summing Up Contributions**: Analogous considerations for the other set of vectors show that: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} k boldsymbol{a}_k = boldsymbol{b} + R^{varphi} boldsymbol{b} + cdots + R^{(p-1)varphi} boldsymbol{b} = boldsymbol{0} ] So, we have constructed sets of sides for the convex ( n )-gon, all angles equal.

The problem states that any selection of 85 trees will necessarily contain all four types of trees. 2. **Analyze Minimum Requirements**: First, consider if we assume there are no more than 15 trees of one type, say birches. Then, the remaining 100 - 15 = 85 trees must contain all four tree types, according to the problem statement. This would form a contradiction if there were less than 15 birches, implying that there must be at least 16 birches. This logic applies symmetrically to the other types of trees (spruces, pines, aspens). 3. **Illustrate General Conclusion**: Every type of tree (birches, spruces, pines, aspens) must be represented by at least 16 trees. So, in any subset of 85 trees, each type definitely appears. 4. **Bound the Calculation for Three Types**: Now, let’s determine the least number such that among any 69 chosen trees, there are always at least three different types of trees. 5. **Consider Contradiction Approach**: Assume the chosen subset of 69 trees contains only two types of trees. Then, at least 100 - 69 = 31 trees are not part of this subset. These 31 trees must include at least 16 trees of each of the remaining two types. This gives rise to a contradiction because removing trees belonging to at least two types leaves enough for ensuring all four types in remaining trees. Thus, every possible set of 69 trees must contain more than two types of trees. 6. **Example for Counterverification**: To verify, consider 34 birches, 34 spruces, 16 pines, and 16 aspens: - In any subset of 85, all four types are present. - However, if we take 34 birches and 34 spruces, the subset of these 68 trees consists only of two types (birches and spruces).

Each player takes turns to move the token to an adjacent vertex, with the restriction that the token cannot revisit any previously occupied vertex.

To accomplish this, let's investigate if the board can be paired in such a way that the second player (Player 2) can always respond to Player 1's moves systematically. 3. **Pairing Vertices:** Imagine breaking down each vertex (except the one where the token initially is) into pairs of neighboring vertices as shown in the diagram. This forms the critical part of the argument: ![Hexagonal Grid](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_5476ffd8e94d65b212aag-33.jpg?height=254&width=309&top_left_y=1668&top_left_x=883) For every move Player 1 makes, Player 2 can move the token to the paired vertex. 4. **Detailed Analysis Using Induction:** - *Base Case (n = 1):* When the hexagon has side length 1, there are only 7 vertices. The schematic representation is simple enough for direct verification: Player 1 moves to any of the 6 adjacent vertices. Player 2 can then move to the only vertex adjacent to the initial vertex but previously unoccupied. This results in Player 2 winning. - *Induction Step:* For a hexagon of size n = k, assume Player 2 can pair each vertex such that Player 2 always has a move if Player 1 makes a move. Now, consider a hexagon of size n = k + 1. The grid can be superimposed with smaller hexagons and maintaining the pairing strategy across the layers. This ensures Player 2 can always make a move based on the induction hypothesis. 5. **Player 2's Winning Strategy:** By the inductive hypothesis and pairing strategy, after every move by Player 1, Player 2 can strategically move to a vertex paired with the newly occupied vertex. This ensures that eventually, Player 1 will run out of moves and thereby lose. 6. **Conclusion:** Through systematic pairing and induction, we conclude that with correct play, the second player will always have a winning strategy for any hexagonal grid size ( n ).

This means that the total time to complete the loop for both buses can be found as follows: - Since the interval between two buses is 21 minutes and they move with equal speeds, the time taken for one bus to complete the circular route is the same as the interval between two consecutive buses. - Therefore, for two buses, the time interval around the whole circular route is equivalent to twice this interval. 2. **Determining the Time Needed for One Complete Loop**: [ text{Total time for one complete loop} = 21 text{ minutes} times 2 = 42 text{ minutes} ] Here, we are doubling the time of one interval to account for the time both buses collectively cover the entire route, since each bus fills one-half of the circular interval. 3. **Introducing a Third Bus**: - Now, when we introduce a third bus, the loop is divided into three equal sections (as they will be evenly spaced along the route). 4. **Calculating the New Interval**: - Since the total time for a complete loop of the route remains 42 minutes, this time is now divided equally among three buses.

Let A(x_1, y_1), B(-x_1, -y_1), and M(x_0, y_0). Since A and M are points on the ellipse, we have x_1^2 + 3y_1^2 = 3b^2 and x_0^2 + 3y_0^2 = 3b^2. Subtracting these equations, we get k_1k_2 = frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0} cdot frac{-y_1 - y_0}{-x_1 - x_0} = frac{y_1^2 - y_0^2}{x_1^2 - x_0^2} = -frac{1}{3} (constant).

Thus, x_1 + x_2 = frac{-6kt}{3k^2 + 1}, and x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{3(t^2 - 1)}{3k^2 + 1}. Delta = 36k^2t^2 - 12(3k^2 + 1)(t^2 - 1) > 0, which simplifies to 3k^2 + 1 > t^2 (*). Given k_1 + k_2 neq 3, we have frac{y_1 - 1}{x_1} + frac{y_2 - 1}{x_2} = 3.

(2) If f(x) has a critical point x_{0}. ① Find the range of values for a. ② Prove that x_{0}+f(x_{0})geqslant 3.","completion":"# Solution: Part (1): First, we perform a change of base transformation on the function f(x): f(x) = frac{1+log_a x}{log_a(x+1)} = frac{1+frac{ln x}{ln a}}{frac{ln(x+1)}{ln a}} = frac{ln a+ln x}{ln(x+1)}. Next, we find the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{ln a+ln x}{ln(x+1)}right) = frac{(x+1)ln(x+1)-x(ln a+ln x)}{x(x+1)ln^2(x+1)}. When a=2, the derivative becomes: f'(x) = frac{(x+1)ln(x+1)-x(ln 2+ln x)}{x(x+1)ln^2(x+1)}. At x=1, we find: f'(1) = frac{2ln 2 - ln 2}{2ln^2 2} = frac{1}{2ln 2}, and f(1) = frac{ln 2 + ln 1}{ln 2} = 1. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at x=1 is: y - 1 = frac{1}{2ln 2}(x - 1), which simplifies to: x - 2ln 2y + 2ln 2 - 1 = 0. Thus, the equation of the tangent line is boxed{x - 2ln 2y + 2ln 2 - 1 = 0}. Part (2): ① For the critical points, we analyze f'(x): f'(x) = frac{(x+1)ln(x+1)-x(ln a+ln x)}{x(x+1)ln^2(x+1)}. The sign of f'(x) is determined by the numerator: varphi(x) = (x+1)ln(x+1)-x(ln a+ln x). Differentiating varphi(x) gives: varphi'(x) = lnfrac{x+1}{x}-ln a. - If 0 < a < 1, then ln a < 0 and lnfrac{x+1}{x} > 0, so varphi'(x) > 0 for all x > 0. This means varphi(x) is monotonically increasing, and since varphi(x) rightarrow 0 as x rightarrow 0, we conclude varphi(x) > 0 for all x > 0, indicating no critical points. - If a > 1, setting varphi'(x) = 0 gives x = frac{1}{a-1}. Here, varphi(x) changes from increasing to decreasing, indicating a local maximum. Since varphi(frac{1}{a-1}) > 0 and varphi(x) rightarrow -infty as x rightarrow +infty, there exists a unique x_0 where varphi(x_0) = 0, making it a critical point. Therefore, the range of values for a is boxed{(1,+infty)}. ② To prove x_{0}+f(x_{0})geqslant 3, we use the given conditions: x_{0}+f(x_{0}) = x_{0} + frac{ln a+ln x_{0}}{ln(x_{0}+1)} = x_{0} + frac{x_{0}+1}{x_{0}} = x_{0} + frac{1}{x_{0}} + 1. By AM-GM inequality, we have: x_{0} + frac{1}{x_{0}} geq 2sqrt{x_{0} cdot frac{1}{x_{0}}} = 2. Thus, x_{0} + f(x_{0}) geq 2 + 1 = 3.

According to the problem, we have: B + G = 100 (since there are 100 boys and girls in total) Each boy gets Rs. 3.60, so the total amount given to the boys is 3.60B. We are given that the total sum is Rs. 312, so the amount given to the girls will be the remaining amount after the boys have been given their share. Therefore, the total amount given to the girls is 312 - 3.60B. Since we don't know the exact amount each girl gets, let's denote it as x. Then the total amount given to the girls can also be expressed as xG. Now we have two expressions for the total amount given to the girls: 312 - 3.60B = xG We are also given that there were approximately 60 boys, so let's use B = 60 as an approximation. Now we can calculate the total amount given to the boys: Total amount for boys = 3.60B = 3.60 * 60 = 216 Subtracting this from the total sum, we get the amount for the girls: Total amount for girls = 312 - 216 = 96 Now we need to find the number of girls, which we can do by using the first equation: B + G = 100 60 + G = 100 G = 100 - 60 G = 40 Now we can find out how much each girl gets by dividing the total amount for girls by the number of girls: Amount each girl gets = Total amount for girls / G = 96 / 40 = 2.4 So each girl gets approximately Rs. boxed{2.40} ."},{"prompt":"The graph of the equation 2x 3y + 5 = 0 is perpendicular to the graph of the equation bx 3y + 1 = 0.

The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series ( S ) with first term ( a ), last term ( l ), and ( n ) terms is: [ S = frac{n}{2} (a + l). ] In our case: [ n = 99999 - 11111 + 1 = 88889, ] [ a = 11111, quad l = 99999. ] Thus: [ 11111 + 11112 + cdots + 99999 = frac{88889}{2} (11111 + 99999) = frac{88889}{2} cdot 111110. ] 7. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: [ frac{88889 times 111110}{2} = 444445 times 11111 times 5. ] Hence, [ sum_{i=1}^{88889} a_{i} = 5 times 11111 times 88889. ] 8. Since ( 5 times 11111 times 88889 ) is clearly divisible by 11111, we have: [ a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{88889} equiv 0 pmod{11111}. ] 9. As a result, [ A equiv 0 pmod{11111}. ] This implies that ( A ) is divisible by 11111. 10. Because any power of 2 (( 2^k )) cannot be divisible by 11111 (since 11111 is not a power of 2), ( A ) cannot be a power of 2.

Now, let's add these amounts together to find out how much money he has without the one-dollar bills: 130 (from 10-dollar bills) + 55 (from 5-dollar bills) = 185. Since Tim needs to pay exactly 128, we subtract this amount from the total amount he has without the one-dollar bills to find out how much he needs to make up with one-dollar bills: 185 - 128 = 57.

Since he needs to use at least 16 bills in total and he has already used 24 bills, he has already met the condition of using at least 16 bills.

We will prove this fact using different methods. Let’s start with the first method provided: 1. **First Method** Let's rewrite the given expression: [ S = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd ] We can reorganize terms as follows: [ S = left(a^2 - 2ab + b^2right) + left(c^2 - 2cd + d^2right) + 3ab + left(ac + bdright) + left(ad + bcright) ] This can be rewritten as: [ S = (a - b)^2 + (c - d)^2 + 3(ab + frac{1}{ab}) + (ac + frac{1}{ac}) + (ad + frac{1}{ad}) ] From the initial condition (abcd = 1), we know that (bc = frac{1}{ad}), so the terms in the form ((x + frac{1}{x})) emerge. 2. The term (x + frac{1}{x}) for any positive (x) is minimized by the AM-GM inequality. We have: [ x + frac{1}{x} geq 2 ] (proven by considering (x + frac{1}{x} - 2 = frac{(x-1)^2}{x})) Therefore, each term in the sum involving (ab + frac{1}{ab}, ac + frac{1}{ac}, ad + frac{1}{ad}) is at least 2. 3. Hence: [ 3 left(ab + frac{1}{ab}right) + left(ac + frac{1}{ac}right) + left(ad + frac{1}{ad}right) geq 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 ] And the remaining terms ((a - b)^2) and ((c - d)^2) are non-negative. 4. Therefore, the value of the sum (S) must be at least 10: [ S geq 10 ] Moreover, equality holds if and only if (a = b = c = d = 1), then each term ( e = 1). So [ oxed{S = 10} ] Conclusion: ( boxed{S geq 10} ) 5. **Second Method** Suppose (a > 1 > b). Let us replace (a) with (a' = 1) while maintaining (abcd = 1) by setting (b' = ab), with ( c' = c) and ( d' = d). 6. The new sum (S') becomes: [ S' = 1^2 + (ab)^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 1 cdot ab + 1 cdot c + 1 cdot d + ab cdot c + ab cdot d + cd ] Subtracting the original sum ( S ): [ S - S' = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd - (1 + (ab)^2 + c^2 + d^2 + ab + c + d + abc + abd + cd) ] Simplifies to: [ S - S' = (a-1)(1-b)left[(a+1)(b+1) + c + dright] ] Since (a > 1) and (b < 1), this term is positive, so [ S > S' ] Repeating this process step-by-step we ultimately ensure (a = b = c = d = 1), thus proving (S geq 10). Conclusion: ( boxed{S geq 10} ) 7. **Third Method** Using the Arithmetic mean - Geometric mean inequality: [ frac{a + b + c + d}{4} geq sqrt[4]{abcd} = 1 implies a + b + c + d geq 4 ] Squaring both sides: [ (a + b + c + d)^2 geq 16 ] Expanding and dividing by 2: [ frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd)}{2} geq 8 ] 8. This results in: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 2(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) geq 16 ] Since: [ 2(ab + ac + bc + ad + bd + cd) = 2(L.H.S) ] The equality holds: [ S geq 10 ] For similar steps for an n-number extension, we have: [ frac{c_1 + c_2 + ldots + c_n}{n} geq sqrt[n]{c_1 c_2 ldots c_n} ] Again, the sum of 10 terms about product 1 ensures (S geq 10).

Let ( x = a_1 a_2 cdots a_n ) where ( a_1, a_2, ldots a_n ) are digits in base-10, and ( x ) is a number composed of these ( n ) digits. 2.

To start, express ( x_1 ): [ x_1 = a_1 cdot 10^{n-1} + a_2 cdot 10^{n-2} + cdots + a_{n-1} cdot 10 + a_n. ] 4. Next, consider ( x_2 ) which is obtained by rotating the digits of ( x ): [ x_2 = a_n cdot 10^{n-1} + a_1 cdot 10^{n-2} + a_2 cdot 10^{n-3} + cdots + a_{n-1}. ] 5. Notice that ( 10x_2 - x_1 ) simplifies to: [ begin{aligned} 10x_2 - x_1 &= 10 left(a_n cdot 10^{n-1} + a_1 cdot 10^{n-2} + cdots + a_{n-1}right) - left(a_1 cdot 10^{n-1} + a_2 cdot 10^{n-2} + cdots + a_nright) &= 10^n a_n - a_n = (10^n - 1) a_n. end{aligned} ] 6. Since we require that ( 1989 mid x_1 ) and ( 1989 mid x_2 ), we get ( 1989 mid (10x_2 - x_1) ). 7. From this, it follows that: [ 1989 mid (10^n - 1) a_n. ] 8. Since ( a_n ) is a digit (0-9), and non-zero for divisibility, we need ( 1989 mid (10^n - 1) ). We factorize 1989: [ 1989 = 9 times 13 times 17. ] 9. We need ( 10^n - 1 ) to be divisible by ( 9, 13, ) and ( 17 ). Checking the order of 10 modulo these numbers: - ( 10^1 equiv 1 mod 9 ), so ( 10^6 equiv 1mod 9 ). - ( 10^1 equiv 1 mod 13 ), so ( 10^6 equiv 1mod 13 ). - For 17, we need to find the smallest ( n ) such that ( 10^n equiv 1 mod 17 ): [ begin{aligned} &10^1 equiv 10 mod 17, &10^2 equiv 15 mod 17, &10^3 equiv 14 mod 17, &10^4 equiv 4 mod 17, &10^5 equiv 6 mod 17, &10^6 equiv 9 mod 17, &10^7 equiv 5 mod 17, &10^8 equiv 16 mod 17, &10^9 equiv 7 mod 17, &10^{10} equiv 2 mod 17, &10^{16} equiv 1 mod 17. end{aligned} ] The order of 10 modulo 17 is 16. 10. Hence, ( n ) needs to be a multiple of: [ text{LCM}(6, 16) = 48. ] 11. Therefore, the smallest ( n ) is ( 48 ). 12. For the smallest ( x ) such that it has the form ( a_1 a_2 cdots a_{48} ), we use digits efficiently.

The height h with respect to the hypotenuse c can be expressed as: [ h = frac{ab}{c} ] This follows from the area of the triangle, which can be written as frac{1}{2}ab and also as frac{1}{2}ch. Equating these gives h = frac{ab}{c}. 3.

Since ( DX = DR ) and ( angle RDX = 60^circ ), the triangle ( XDR ) is equilateral.

The equilateral triangle ( YDS ) yields ( angle DYS = 60^circ ), so that ( angle RYS = 180^circ - angle DYS = 120^circ ). This implies that the quadrilateral ( RYSX ) is cyclic. Therefore, the points ( R, Y, S, X ) lie on one circle.

Combined with ( angle RDS = 60^circ ), we get ( angle RDS = angle ADB ). Thus, ( angle RDB = angle RDS - angle SDB = angle ADB - angle SDB = angle SDA ). Since ( BD = AD ) and ( DY = DS ), the triangles ( YDB ) and ( SDA ) are congruent. Hence, ( BY = AS ) and ( BX = CR ). 9. **Inequality:** The inequality ( BX + BY leq 2 cdot SR ) rewrites as: [ CR + AS leq 2 cdot SR ] Therefore: [ SR geq frac{AS + CR}{2} ] 10. **Applying AM-GM Inequality:** By the AM-GM inequality, we have: [ frac{AS + CR}{2} geq sqrt{AS cdot CR} ] Thus: [ SR geq sqrt{AS cdot CR} ] Squaring both sides, we get: [ SR^2 geq AS cdot CR ] Hence, we have proved that ( SR^2 geq AS cdot CR ).

To return to point O after 4 steps, Xiao Ming's mother must take 2 steps forward and 2 steps backward in any order.

Thus, [ P(X=3) = {C}_{5}^{4} times left(frac{3}{4}right)^{4} times left(frac{1}{4}right)^{1} + {C}_{5}^{1} times left(frac{3}{4}right)^{1} times left(frac{1}{4}right)^{4} = frac{105}{256} ] - For X=5, she could have taken all 5 steps forward or all 5 steps backward.

Each knight can attack up to 8 squares, but this number can be reduced if the knight is near the edge of the board or if other knights are placed such that their attack squares overlap. 2. **Initial Considerations:** - A chessboard has 64 squares (8x8). - To maximize the number of squares attacked, knights should be placed such that their attack squares overlap as little as possible. - Knights placed near the center of the board have the maximum potential to attack 8 squares each. 3. **Optimal Placement:** - The central 4x4 region of the board (squares (3,3) to (6,6)) allows knights to attack the maximum number of squares. - Placing knights outside this region reduces the number of squares they can attack. 4. **Coloring Argument:** - The chessboard is colored in a checkerboard pattern with alternating black and white squares. - By the pigeonhole principle, if all three knights are placed on squares of the same color, at least two knights will be in rows or columns that cause their attack squares to overlap, reducing the total number of unique squares attacked. 5. **Distribution of Knights:** - To avoid overlap and maximize the number of attacked squares, knights should be placed on squares of different colors. - There are 4 central black squares: (3,3), (5,5), (4,4), (6,6). - There are 4 central white squares: (3,5), (5,3), (4,6), (6,4). 6. **Counting the Ways:** - If two knights are on black squares and one on a white square, there are 4 ways to choose the two black squares and 8 ways to choose the white square, giving (4 times 8 = 32) ways. - Similarly, if two knights are on white squares and one on a black square, there are 4 ways to choose the two white squares and 8 ways to choose the black square, giving (4 times 8 = 32) ways. 7. **Total Number of Ways:** - Adding the two cases together, we get (32 + 32 = 64) ways.

Is it possible to get a table filled with \`+\` signs in a finite number of moves?","completion":"\`\`\`markdown 1. **Initial Observation**: We start by counting the number of minus signs (-) in the given table. The table is: begin{array}{cccc} + & + & + & - - & + & + & - + & + & + & - + & - & - & - end{array} Let's count the - signs in each row: - First row: 1 minus sign - Second row: 2 minus signs - Third row: 1 minus sign - Fourth row: 3 minus signs Adding these up, the total number of minus signs in the given table is: [ 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 7 ] Therefore, there are 7 minus signs. 2. **Parity Analysis**: We note that 7 is an odd number. 3. **Effect of an Operation on Parity**: We need to understand what happens to the parity of the number of minus signs whenever we perform an operation (choosing a row or column and inverting all the signs in it). - When we choose a row or a column, each plus sign (+) in that row or column becomes a minus sign (-) and each minus sign (-) in that row or column becomes a plus sign (+). - Therefore, the net effect is that the number of minus signs in that row or column will change from k to n - k, where n is the total number of cells in that row or column and k is the number of minus signs originally in that row or column. 4. **Parity of Changes**: If we look at the operation: - If the original number of minus signs (k) in the selected row or column is even, n - k will be odd since n (number of columns) is 4 (an even number). - If k is odd, n - k will be even because subtracting an odd number from an even number results in an odd number. Thus, whether k is odd or even, the parity of the number of minus signs will change after each operation. 5. **Conclusion on Parity**: - Since we start with an odd number of minus signs (7), and each operation changes the parity, we can never reach an even parity starting from an odd number by performing any number of operations. - To fill the entire table with plus signs (+), the total number of minus signs must be 0, which is an even number. Since we start with an odd number of minus signs and every operation changes this parity, it is impossible to reach a state where the table contains only plus signs. Thus, it is not possible to turn the table into one filled entirely with plus signs through the given operations.

This means the partial sums of the harmonic series grow without bound. 3. **Greedy Algorithm Approach:** Since the harmonic series diverges, there exists some ( n ) such that: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k} < 2019 < sum_{k=1}^{n+1} frac{1}{k}. ] This implies that for large enough ( n ), the partial sum can be close to but less than 2019. 4. **Constructing the Sum:** We use a greedy algorithm to construct the sum ( 2019 ) using distinct positive integers. Here’s the step-by-step procedure: - Start with ( S = 2019 ). - At each step, select the largest possible integer ( a_i ) such that ( frac{1}{a_i} leq S ). - Subtract ( frac{1}{a_i} ) from ( S ) and continue until ( S = 0 ). 5. **Algorithm Details:** - Let ( S ) be the remaining sum to achieve, initially ( S = 2019 ). - Find the integer ( a_i ) such that: [ frac{1}{a_i} leq S. ] - Update: [ S := S - frac{1}{a_i}. ] - Ensure the selected integers ( a_i ) are distinct at each step. 6. **Decreasing Remainder:** Each time we subtract ( frac{1}{a_i} ) from ( S ), the remainder ( S ) decreases. Since the harmonic series includes all positive integers, and each step reduces ( S ) with a distinct ( a_i ), this process will eventually lead ( S ) to 0. 7. **Termination:** The process must terminate because each subtraction step reduces ( S ) by an amount that is strictly positive and less than ( S ). The algorithm ensures that ( S ) gets smaller with each distinct new fraction until we obtain: [ S = 0. ] 8. **Conclusion:** Thus, it is possible to find distinct positive integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) such that their unit fractions sum to 2019.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so: 140 minutes ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 2.3333 hours (repeating) Now we know that Cole took 2.3333 hours to drive to work at an average speed of 75 km/h. We can calculate the distance from home to work using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time Distance to work = 75 km/h × 2.3333 hours = 175 km (approximately) Since the round trip took a total of 4 hours, we can find the time Cole took to return home by subtracting the time he took to get to work from the total round trip time: Time to return home = Total round trip time - Time to work Time to return home = 4 hours - 2.3333 hours = 1.6667 hours (repeating) Now we know the distance for the return trip is the same as the distance to work (175 km), and we have the time it took for the return trip (1.6667 hours). We can now find the average speed for the return trip using the formula: Speed = Distance ÷ Time Average speed on return trip = 175 km ÷ 1.6667 hours ≈ 105 km/h Therefore, Cole's average speed driving back home was approximately boxed{105} km/h."},{"prompt":"A shopkeeper sold an article offering a discount of 5% and earned a certain profit.

When the shopkeeper offers a 5% discount, the selling price (SP) becomes ( 95% ) of the marked price, i.e., ( SP = 0.95 times M ). The profit earned when a discount is offered is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, i.e., ( Profit = SP - CP ). The percentage of profit earned with the discount is given by: [ text{Percentage Profit with Discount} = left( frac{Profit}{CP} right) times 100 ] If no discount was offered, the selling price would be equal to the marked price, i.e., ( SP = M ), and the percentage of profit would be 30%.

If ( BC ) is a segment, then for any point ( D ) other than ( B ) and ( C ) on ( overline{BC} ), we have ( F(D) < max{F(B), F(C)} ). 2. **Proof of the Lemma:** Set ( B(-1,0) ), ( C(1,0) ), ( D(x,0) ), and ( A_i(x_i, y_i) ). Then, [ F(x) = sum_{i=1}^n [(x - x_i)^2 + y_i^2] ] is a quadratic function with a positive leading coefficient in ( x ). From the convexity of the quadratic function, the lemma follows. 3. **Main Problem:** Suppose ( R_1, R_2, ldots, R_{2018} ) allows ( S ) to attain its maximum. We first prove that ( R_i ) (for ( 1 le i le 2018 )) are all at the vertices of the pentagon. If not, say ( R_1 ) is not one of the vertices, we can always find ( overline{MN} ) with ( MN ) not outside of the pentagon, and ( R_1 in overline{MN} ). By the Lemma, there exists ( K in {M, N} ) with ( F(R_1) < F(K) ). Then ( K, R_2, ldots, R_{2018} ) generates a larger ( S ), which is a contradiction. This proves our claim. 4. Let ( R_i ) be represented by complex numbers ( u_i ) on the unit circle in the complex plane, and the vertices of the pentagon being the 5th roots of unity. We have [ S = sum_{1 le i < j le 2018} |u_i - u_j|^2. ] Note the identity [ sum_{1 le i < j le 2018} |u_i - u_j|^2 + left| sum_{i=1}^{2018} u_i right|^2 = 2018 sum_{i=1}^{2018} |u_i|^2 = 2018^2. ] Thus, it suffices to minimize ( T := left| sum_{i=1}^{2018} u_i right| ). 5. Note that all ( u_i ) are the vertices of the regular pentagon. Let ( z = e^{ifrac{2pi}{5}} = a + bi ), ( z^2 = c + di ), ( z^3 = c - di ), ( z^4 = a - bi ).

Note that ( a = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{4} ), ( c = frac{-sqrt{5} - 1}{4} ). The above expression is equal to [ frac{1}{4}(2p - u - v + sqrt{5}(u - v))^2. ] Now we find the minimum of the above expression. Set ( m = 2p - u - v ), ( n = v - u in mathbb{Z} ) and ( 2|m - n ). It suffices to minimize ( |m - sqrt{5}n| ). First note that [ |m - sqrt{5}n| = frac{|m^2 - 5n^2|}{|m + sqrt{5}n|}. ] Since ( m, n ) have the same parity, ( |m^2 - 5n^2| ge 4 ). Note that ( 2m = 4p - 2u - 2v = 5p - 2018 ), hence ( m equiv 1 pmod{5} ). Hence ( m^2 - 5n^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}, 1 pmod{5} ). Thus ( m^2 - 5n^2 = -4 ) or ( |m^2 - 5n^2| ge 16 ). 7. If ( |m^2 - 5n^2| ge 16 ), then ( 2u + 2v le 2018 implies |n| le u + v le 1009 implies |m - sqrt{5}n| ge frac{16}{4000} ). When ( m^2 - 5n^2 = -4 ), by the theory of Pell's Equation, the only solutions ( (|m|, |n|) ) with ( |n| le 2018 ) are [ (1, 1), (4, 2), (29, 13), (76, 34), (521, 233), (1364, 610). ] Among these, we have to maximize the denominator, so we have to choose the largest of them that works. If we pick the largest of the listed pairs, since ( m equiv 1 pmod{5} ), it follows that ( m = -1364 ), in which case ( p < 0 ), contradiction. Thus ( (1364, 610) ) is impossible. 8. Now consider ( (m, n) = (521, 233) ). The above expression is [ frac{4}{521 + sqrt{5} times 233} < frac{4}{521 times 2} < frac{16}{4000}, ] therefore the above expression attains minimum. For all equality cases of inequalities to hold, we must have ( m = 521, n = 233 ), hence ( p = 612, u = 470, v = 936 ). The imaginary part of the expression must be 0, thus ( q = t, r = s ).

Specifically, we want to find the minimum possible sum and provide an example if it exists. 2. **Identify consistent sums**: The numbers 1 through 9 have a unique total sum: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 ] Since each number appears exactly once, the sums of any three rows or any three columns must have this same total of 45. 3. **Minimum Sum per Side Calculation**: We imagine trying to achieve minimum possible sums. Each of the four corners of the grid appears in 2 sums (as they belong to two sides of a row-column intersection), and each other number belongs to exactly one sum: - Let ( s ) be the common sum along each side. Summing the four sides (due to overlap of corners): [ 4s = 2(text{sum of corners}) + (text{sum of remaining 5 numbers}) ] Sum of all corner numbers, ((1 + 3 + 7 + 9) = 20).

The area (S) of the triangle can be computed using Heron’s formula: [ S = sqrt{p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c)} ] Since ( p ) and ( a, b, c ) are rational, ( S^2 ) is rational.

We need to prove that the radii of two of these circles are equal. 1. **Identify the setup of the problem**: The problem describes a configuration where the circles are inscribed such that they are tangent to the sides of the square and to each other. We need to understand the geometric positioning of these circles inside the square. 2. **Assume circle positions**: Assume that two of these inscribed circles are in adjacent corners of the square, say corners A and B. Let's denote these circles as C_1 and C_2 respectively. Without loss of generality, let the third circle C_3 be positioned in such a way that it is tangent to both C_1 and C_2 externally and also to sides CD and DA. 3. **Diagram and symmetry considerations**: Consider the symmetry of the square and the placement of the circles due to their tangency conditions. Positioning two circles in adjacent corners, let's say C_1 and C_2 in corners A and B, implies that the third circle placed must fit such that it maintains tangency conditions with the external tangency required with C_1 and C_2, and touches sides CD and DA accordingly. 4. **Analyzing the positions**: - Each circle tangent to two sides of the square means they must fit into the angle formed by the sides (which is a right angle frac{pi}{2} radians or 90 degrees). - The circles at A and B are tangent to parts of the same sides AB and BC. 5. **Utilizing symmetry and congruence of the circles**: Since placing C_1 and C_2 in corners A and B leaves the configuration symmetric about the diagonal of the square, and as C_3 is tangent to both C_1 and C_2 externally as well as to the sides CD and DA, it follows that C_1 and C_2 must have the same radius. This ensures the conditions of tangency and symmetric placement are satisfied. 6. **Conclusion**: Thus, the radii of the circles C_1 and C_2 which are in the corners A and B of the square, are equal due to the symmetry and placement constraints of the given problem.

We're given a quadratic polynomial (a parabola) with integer coefficients that touches the x-axis. We need to prove that there exists a point with integer coordinates ((a, b)) on this parabola such that the graph of the polynomial ( y = x^2 + ax + b ) also touches the x-axis. 1. **Given conditions and the form of the quadratic polynomial**: The given quadratic polynomial can be written as: [ y = ax^2 + bx + c ] Since the parabola \\"touches\\" the x-axis, it must have a double root, implying that the discriminant of this quadratic polynomial is zero. 2. **Understanding the graph touching the x-axis**: If the parabola touches the x-axis, its equation should have a double root. Let's assume the double root to be ( r ). Thus, we can write the equation of the parabola as: [ y = a(x - r)^2 ] We know that for any quadratic expression with a double root: [ y = (x - r)^2 = x^2 - 2rx + r^2 ] which is a quadratic equation with a double root ( r ). 3. **Choosing integer coordinates ((a, b))**: Let's take ( r ) as an integer (since the coefficients are integers).

If he had driven at 55 mph, the time it would have taken him is: Time = 40 miles / 55 mph To calculate this, we divide 40 by 55: Time = 40 / 55 Time ≈ 0.7273 hours To convert this time from hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Time ≈ 0.7273 hours * 60 minutes/hour Time ≈ 43.64 minutes Now let's calculate the time it actually took Liam to arrive at work driving at 60 mph: Time = 40 miles / 60 mph Time = 40 / 60 Time = 2/3 hours Again, converting this time from hours to minutes: Time = 2/3 hours * 60 minutes/hour Time = 40 minutes Now we can find out how many minutes before his start time Liam arrived at work by subtracting the time it would have taken him if he drove at 55 mph from the time it actually took him at 60 mph: Time difference = 43.64 minutes - 40 minutes Time difference ≈ 3.64 minutes Therefore, Liam arrived approximately boxed{3.64} minutes before his start time."},{"prompt":"The large fivepointed star on the national flag must be rotated at least degrees to coincide with its original position.","completion":"**Solution**: According to the concept of rotational symmetry, the figure is divided into five equal parts.

Given that the first pipe can fill the tank in 60 minutes, its rate ( R_1 ) is ( frac{1}{60} ) tank per minute. When both pipes are open, the net rate at which the tank is filled is the rate of the first pipe minus the rate of the second pipe, which we can express as ( R_1 - R_2 ). It is given that when both pipes are open, the tank is filled in 180 minutes. Therefore, the net rate when both pipes are open is ( frac{1}{180} ) tank per minute. We can set up the equation: [ R_1 - R_2 = frac{1}{180} ] Substituting the value of ( R_1 ) into the equation, we get: [ frac{1}{60} - R_2 = frac{1}{180} ] To find ( R_2 ), we solve for it: [ R_2 = frac{1}{60} - frac{1}{180} ] To combine the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 180: [ R_2 = frac{3}{180} - frac{1}{180} ] [ R_2 = frac{2}{180} ] [ R_2 = frac{1}{90} ] So the rate at which the second pipe alone can empty the cistern is ( frac{1}{90} ) tank per minute.

Igor Fedorovich Akulich from Minsk questioned this estimation, reasoning the calculation might be more nuanced than the suggested 22.5 attempts. **Task**: Determine the expected number of attempts (considering all attempts to open suitcases—both failed and successful ones).","completion":"1. **Problem Clarification:** - We are given ( n = 10 ) suitcases and tasks are to find a mathematically expected number of tries, including all unsuccessful and successful attempts, to open these suitcases. - We will solve this problem in a general case for ( n ) suitcases and come back to ( n = 10 ) at the end. 2. **Notation and Initial Setup:** - Let ( Y ) be a random variable representing the number of attempts required to open the first suitcase. - The problem scenario is as follows: - ( Y = 1 ) with ( frac{1}{n} ) probability. - ( Y = 2 ) with ( frac{n-1}{n} cdot frac{1}{n-1} = frac{1}{n} ) probability. - Generally, ( Y = k ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ) each with probability ( frac{1}{n} ). - For ( Y = n-1 ), the event has a probability ( frac{2}{n} ) because it can occur in two equally probable situations: when the right key is either the ((n-1))-th or the (n)-th key. - Thus, we derive all necessary probabilities for each step. 3. **Expected Value for ( Y ):** - The expected value ( mathrm{E}[Y] ) can be calculated as: [ begin{aligned} mathrm{E}[Y] &= sum_{k=1}^{n-2} k cdot frac{1}{n} + (n-1) cdot frac{2}{n} &= frac{1 + 2 + ldots + (n-2) + 2(n-1)}{n} end{aligned} ] Simplifying the sum inside the fraction: [ begin{aligned} mathrm{E}[Y] &= frac{1 + 2 + ldots + (n-2) + (n-1) + (n-1)}{n} &= frac{n(n-1)}{2n} + frac{n-1}{n} &= frac{n(n-1)}{2n} + frac{2(n-1)}{2n} &= frac{n-1}{2} + 1 = frac{n+1}{2} end{aligned} ] Therefore, the expected number of attempts to open one suitcase ( mathrm{E}[Y] ) is simplified to: [ mathrm{E}[Y] = frac{n+1}{2} - frac{1}{n} ] 4. **Recursion for Total Attempts ( X_n ):** - Let ( X_n ) represent the total number of attempts to open all ( n ) suitcases. - Once the first suitcase is opened after ( Y ) attempts, we are left with ( n-1 ) suitcases. - Hence, the recursive formula for ( X_n ): [ X_n = Y + X_{n-1} ] Taking the expectation: [ mathrm{E}[X_n] = mathrm{E}[Y] + mathrm{E}[X_{n-1}] ] Indicate ( e_n = mathrm{E}[X_n] ): [ e_n = e_{n-1} + frac{n+1}{2} - frac{1}{n} ] Using ( e_1 = 0 ) since no attempts are needed for zero suitcases: [ e_{n} = e_{n-1}+ frac{n+1}{2} - frac{1}{n} ] This progression solves stepwise until: [ e_n = sum_{k=1}^n left( frac{k+1}{2} - frac{1}{k} right) ] 5. **Explicit Formula for Total Attempts ( X_n ):** [ e_n = frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^n k + frac{1}{2} sum_{k=1}^n - sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{k} ] [ e_n = frac{1}{2} left( frac{n(n+1)}{2} right) + frac{n}{2} - sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{k} ] Using Harmonic Series approximation: [ H_n approx ln n + gamma ] Hence the expected value for ( X_{10} ): [ e_{10} approx frac{10 cdot 11}{4} - (ln 10 + 0.577) ] 6. **Final Calculation for Given Problem:** [ e_{10} approx 27.5 - 2.3 approx 29.62 ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{29.62} ]"},{"prompt":"Given complex numbers z_1=3+i and z_2=1i, then the corresponding point of z=z_1cdot z_2 in the complex plane is located in ( ) A: The first quadrant B: The second quadrant C: The third quadrant D: The fourth quadr","completion":"The product z_1cdot z_2=(3+i)cdot(1-i)=4-2i.

How many different selections ensure that the group of 3 students includes both male and female students?","completion":"First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 students out of 8 without any gender restriction, which is given by the combination formula binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Thus, the total number of ways to choose 3 students from 8 is given by: binom{8}{3} = frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = frac{8 times 7 times 6}{3 times 2 times 1} = 56. Next, we'll subtract the number of ways to choose 3 students all of the same gender. For all male students, the number of ways is binom{5}{3} because there are 5 male students. Similarly, for all female students, the number of ways is binom{3}{3} because there are 3 female students. Calculate each: - For all male students: binom{5}{3} = frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10. - For all female students (since there are only 3 female students, there's only 1 way to choose all of them): binom{3}{3} = frac{3!}{3!(3-3)!} = frac{1}{1} = 1.

Show that: chi(G) leq sqrt{2m} + 1","completion":"1. **Introduce Proper Coloring Concept**: Consider a proper coloring of the graph ( G ) using ( chi(G) ) colors. This coloring partitions the vertices of ( G ) into ( chi(G) ) disjoint sets ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{chi(G)} ), where each set ( A_i ) contains vertices that share the same color. 2. **Proper Coloring Implication**: By definition of proper coloring, no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Therefore, if there were no edge between any two sets ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) (with ( i neq j )), then we could color both sets ( A_i ) and ( A_j ) with the same color. This would contradict the definition of ( chi(G) ) as the chromatic number since we would then need fewer than ( chi(G) ) colors. 3. **Calculate Minimum Number of Edges**: Consequently, there must be at least one edge between every pair of sets, meaning that the number of edges ( m ) must be at least the number of edges in a complete graph on ( chi(G) ) vertices. This gives: [ m geq binom{chi(G)}{2} ] where ( binom{chi(G)}{2} ) denotes the binomial coefficient representing combinations of ( chi(G) ) vertices taken 2 at a time. Explicitly, this is: [ binom{chi(G)}{2} = frac{chi(G)(chi(G) - 1)}{2} ] Therefore, we have: [ m geq frac{chi(G) (chi(G) - 1)}{2} ] 4. **Solve the Inequality**: We need to solve this inequality for ( chi(G) ). Rearrange for ( chi(G) ): [ 2m geq chi(G)^2 - chi(G) ] Rearrange the terms: [ chi(G)^2 - chi(G) - 2m leq 0 ] 5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation**: Let's solve this quadratic inequality: [ chi(G)^2 - chi(G) - 2m = 0 ] This is a standard quadratic equation of the form ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ). Using the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) where ( a=1 ), ( b=-1 ), and ( c=-2m ): [ chi(G) = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 8m}}{2} ] 6. **Select the Positive Root**: Since ( chi(G) ) must be a positive integer, we take the positive root: [ chi(G) leq frac{1 + sqrt{1 + 8m}}{2} ] 7. **Approximate the Expression**: This expression can be further simplified: [ frac{1 + sqrt{1 + 8m}}{2} approx sqrt{2m} + frac{1}{2} text{ for large } m ] This is slightly stronger than the stated bound ( chi(G) leq sqrt{2m} + 1 ). # Conclusion: Thus, we have proven that: [ chi(G) leq sqrt{2m} + 1 ] (boxed{sqrt{2m} + 1})"},{"prompt":"Winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries.

According to the given information, the ratio of petrol to kerosene is 3:2, which means: P/K = 3/2 We also know that the total quantity of the mixture in the container is approximately 30 liters (since 29.999999999999996 is very close to 30, we can use 30 for simplicity). Therefore: P + K = 30 Now, we can express K in terms of P using the ratio: K = (2/3) * P Substituting this into the total quantity equation, we get: P + (2/3) * P = 30 (3/3) * P + (2/3) * P = 30 (5/3) * P = 30 P = (3/5) * 30 P = 18 liters Now we can find K: K = (2/3) * P K = (2/3) * 18 K = 12 liters So initially, we have 18 liters of petrol and 12 liters of kerosene. When 10 liters of the mixture is taken out, the ratio of petrol to kerosene in this removed mixture is still 3:2.

The first 196 terms can be grouped into 98 pairs: [ frac{196}{2} = 98 text{ pairs} ] 5. **Sum of All Pairs**: Each pair sums to 10, so the sum of all 98 pairs equals: [ 98 times 10 = 980 ] 6. **Add the Last Term**: The last term, which is 20, was not included in any pair.

Given that G also lies on the parabola, the relation between x_0 and y_0 is given by y_0^2 = 2px_0. By the distance from G to the focus of the parabola, we get sqrt{(x_0 - p)^2 + y_0^2} = 3, which simplifies to x_0 - p/2 = 3 since the focus of a parabola y^2 = 2px is located at (p/2, 0). Solving simultaneously we find: x_0 = 1, quad y_0 = pm 2sqrt{2}, quad p = 4. Thus, the equation of parabola C_1 is: y^2 = 8x. (II) From part (I) we have the focus of parabola C_1 at F(2, 0). Since one focus of ellipse C_2 coincides with the focus of C_1, the semi-latus rectum c of ellipse C_2 is 2, and we have the following relation for an ellipse: m^2 - n^2 = c^2 = 4.

Simplifying this inequality gives us: 16m^2 + n^2 - lambda^2 > 0. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation is: x_1 + x_2 = frac{8m^2lambda}{16m^2 + n^2}, and hence their y-coordinates satisfy: y_1 + y_2 = -4(x_1 + x_2) + 2lambda = frac{2lambda n^2}{16m^2 + n^2}.

It is a common type of question in high school exams and is considered moderate in difficulty. [Solution] Let F_1(-c, 0) and F_2(c, 0) be the coordinates of the foci. The equation of line l is x = -c. The equations of the asymptotes of the hyperbola are y = pmfrac{b}{a}x. Thus, the coordinates of points A and B where the asymptotes intersect line l are A(-c, frac{b}{a}c) and B(-c, -frac{b}{a}c). Since the circle with diameter AB passes through point F_2, F_1 is the center of the circle. Hence, AF_1 = F_1F_2 = 2c. This implies that frac{b}{a}c = 2c. Solving for b, we get b = 2a.

The vertices of the original triangle and this smaller, similar triangle share the vertex from which the median is drawn. 2. **Determine the similarity ratio:** In a triangle, the midline is parallel to the third side and half its length. The height of the smaller, similar triangle is also half that of the original triangle since the midline is equally spaced from the vertex. Given these properties, the smaller triangle is similar to the original triangle with a similarity ratio of ( frac{1}{2} ). 3. **Calculate the area ratio:** The area of similar triangles is proportional to the square of the similarity ratio. Hence, the area ratio of the smaller triangle to the original triangle is: [ left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4} ] Therefore, the area of the smaller triangle is ( frac{1}{4} ) of the area of the original triangle. Second Method: 1. **Understand the breaking by medians:** Drawing all three medians in a triangle divides it into four smaller triangles of equal area. This happens because all medians intersect at the centroid, which balances the triangle into smaller triangles of equal area. 2. **Calculate the areas:** Since each of the four smaller triangles has the same area, each area is: [ frac{1}{4} text{ of the area of the original triangle} ] Thus, any single median divides the triangle into two parts, with one part comprising half the area cut off by a smaller triangle, which contains ( frac{1}{4} ) of the area.

(2) The school plans to purchase a total of 80 items of these two types of supplies, and requires the number of thermometers to be no less than frac{1}{4} of the number of disinfectant. Design the most costeffective purchasing plan, calculate the minimum cost, and explain the reason.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution: Part 1: Finding the Unit Price Let's denote: - x as the price of each thermometer (in yuan), - y as the price of each barrel of disinfectant (in yuan). From the given information, we can set up the following system of equations: 1. For 4 thermometers and 2 barrels of disinfectant costing 400 yuan, we have: 4x + 2y = 400. 2. For 2 thermometers and 4 barrels of disinfectant costing 320 yuan, we have: 2x + 4y = 320. Solving this system of equations, we proceed as follows: - Multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of x the same: - Original second equation: 2x + 4y = 320, - After multiplying by 2: 4x + 8y = 640. - Subtract the first equation from the modified second equation to eliminate x: - (4x + 8y) - (4x + 2y) = 640 - 400, - Simplifying: 6y = 240, - Solving for y: y = 40. - Substitute y = 40 back into one of the original equations to find x: - Using the first equation: 4x + 2(40) = 400, - Simplifying: 4x + 80 = 400, - Solving for x: 4x = 320, - Therefore: x = 80. So, the unit price of the thermometers is 80 yuan, and the unit price of the disinfectant is 40 yuan. boxed{text{The price of each thermometer is 80 yuan, and the price of each barrel of disinfectant is 40 yuan.}} Part 2: Designing the Most Cost-Effective Purchasing Plan Let m represent the number of thermometers to be purchased. Consequently, the number of barrels of disinfectant will be (80 - m), given the total items to be purchased are 80. The condition that the number of thermometers must be no less than frac{1}{4} of the number of disinfectant barrels translates to: - m geqslant frac{1}{4}(80 - m). Solving this inequality: - Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction: 4m geqslant 80 - m, - Adding m to both sides: 5m geqslant 80, - Dividing by 5: m geqslant 16. Let w represent the total cost. The cost formula, based on the unit prices found in part (1), is: - w = 80m + 40(80 - m), - Simplifying: w = 40m + 3200. Since the coefficient of m in the cost formula is positive (40 > 0), the cost w increases as m increases. Thus, to minimize w, we choose the smallest possible value for m, which is 16. Substituting m = 16 into the cost formula: - w = 80 times 16 + 40 times (80 - 16), - Calculating: w = 1280 + 2560, - Simplifying: w = 3840 yuan.

How much does a person save in a year by renting by the month rather than by the week, considering the peak and nonpeak seasons rates?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total cost for weekly rentals for a year. There are 52 weeks in a year. The non-peak season lasts for 4 months, which is approximately 4 months * (52 weeks / 12 months) = 17.33 weeks (rounded to two decimal places). The remaining weeks are peak season weeks, which is 52 weeks - 17.33 weeks = 34.67 weeks (rounded to two decimal places). During non-peak seasons, the weekly rate is 10 - 2 = 8 per week. So, for 17.33 weeks, the cost would be 17.33 weeks * 8/week = 138.64. During peak seasons, the weekly rate is 10 per week. So, for 34.67 weeks, the cost would be 34.67 weeks * 10/week = 346.70. The total cost for weekly rentals for a year would be 138.64 (non-peak) + 346.70 (peak) = 485.34. Now, let's calculate the total cost for monthly rentals for a year. There are 12 months in a year. The non-peak season lasts for 4 months, and the peak season lasts for 8 months. During non-peak seasons, the monthly rate is 35 per month. So, for 4 months, the cost would be 4 months * 35/month = 140. During peak seasons, the monthly rate is 40 per month. So, for 8 months, the cost would be 8 months * 40/month = 320. The total cost for monthly rentals for a year would be 140 (non-peak) + 320 (peak) = 460. Finally, let's calculate the savings by renting by the month rather than by the week. Savings = Total cost for weekly rentals - Total cost for monthly rentals Savings = 485.34 - 460 Savings = 25.34 Therefore, a person saves boxed{25.34} in a year by renting by the month rather than by the week, considering the peak and non-peak seasons rates."},{"prompt":"When a polynomial is divided by 3x^3 4x^2 + x 5, what are the possible degrees of the remainder?

Given that the production ratios for regular medical masks and surgical masks are 80% and 20% respectively, and the proportions of strap masks within these categories are 10% and 20% respectively, we can calculate the overall probability of selecting a strap mask as follows: - The probability of selecting a strap mask from the regular medical masks is the product of the probability of selecting a regular medical mask and the probability that it is a strap mask, which is 0.8 times 0.1. - Similarly, the probability of selecting a strap mask from the surgical masks is the product of the probability of selecting a surgical mask and the probability that it is a strap mask, which is 0.2 times 0.2.

The sum of the numbers on each arc is divisible by the product of the numbers on the arc following it in the clockwise direction. What is the greatest possible value of the largest number written?","completion":": 1. **Introduction and Restatement of the Problem:** On a circle, there are placed 1000 non-intersecting arcs. On each of these arcs, two natural numbers are written. The sum of the numbers on each arc is divisible by the product of the numbers of the subsequent arc (in the clockwise direction). The question asks for the largest possible value of the numbers written on these arcs. 2. **Main Claim to Prove:** We need to show that the numbers on these arcs do not exceed 2001. 3. **Lemma 1 and Proof:** Let's state and prove Lemma 1 which will help in the subsequent arguments. **Lemma:** If ( x ) and ( y ) are natural numbers such that ( xy = x + y ), then ( x = y = 2 ). Further, if ( xy < x+y ), then at least one of ( x ) or ( y ) is equal to 1. **Proof of Lemma 1:** Consider the inequality ( xy leq x + y ). We can rewrite this as: [ xy - x - y + 1 leq 1 implies (x-1)(y-1) leq 1 ] The cases to consider are: - If ( (x-1)(y-1) = 0 ), then one of ( x ) or ( y ) equals 1. - If ( (x-1)(y-1) = 1 ), solving this leads to ( x = y = 2 ). Therefore, ( x = y = 2 ) or at least one of the numbers ( x ), ( y ) is 1. 4. **Lemma 2 and Proof:** **Lemma:** If ( xy = c ) where ( x > 0, y > 0, ) and ( x leq y ), then the sum ( x + y ) decreases as ( x ) increases. **Proof of Lemma 2:** Consider the function ( f(x) = x + frac{c}{x} ). Notice that: [ f(x) = left(sqrt{frac{c}{x}} - xright)^2 + 2sqrt{c} ] This function is decreasing on the interval ( (0, sqrt{c}) ). Hence, as ( x ) increases ( f(x) = x + y ) decreases. 5. **Main Proof Construction:** - Let ( a ) and ( b ) be the numbers on each arc, with the relationship that ( frac{a+b}{cd} ) (sum of the current arc divided by the product of the subsequent arc numbers) is an integer. - We will demonstrate the bound via pairs ( (1, k) ). 6. **Cycle Formation and Product-Sum Argument:** - Following the above lemmas, assume we encounter pairs ( (1, k) ). As we move clockwise: - Pairs evolve as ( (1, k+1), (1, k+2), ldots, (1, k+999) ) - Forming the cycle, ( k+1000 ) must be divisible by ( k ), hence ( k leq 1000 ) - Thus, ( k+999 leq 1999 ) 7. **Conclusion in the Second Case:** - In this case, a pair differing from ( (1, l+1) ) emerges where sum-product relationships still hold. - Calculations end up showing ( s_{1000} leq 1000 + frac{1}{2}(l+1) ) and ( s_{1000} geq l ) - Verifying these bounds by contradiction or exhaustive search, ensuring each number remains ( leq 2001 ). 8. **Final Bound Verification:** - Any arc number can be at most ( 2001 ): - Example construction ( (1, 2001), (2, 1001), ldots ) ensures bounds without contradictions. # Conclusion: The theoretical upper limit and tangible practical example both confirm that the highest number written on these arcs does not exceed: [ boxed{2001} ]"},{"prompt":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, where a_1 = 29 and S_{10} = S_{20}, find the maximum value of the sum of the first n terms of this sequence.","completion":"To solve this problem, let us denote the common difference of the arithmetic sequence as d. We know that the n-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. The sum of the first n terms (denoted S_n) can be calculated as: S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n). Given that S_{10} = S_{20}, we can set up equations for both sums. For S_{10}, we have: S_{10} = frac{10}{2}(a_1 + a_{10}) = 5(a_1 + a_1 + 9d) = 5(29 + 29 + 9d) = 290 + 45d. For S_{20}, we have: S_{20} = frac{20}{2}(a_1 + a_{20}) = 10(a_1 + a_1 + 19d) = 10(29 + 29 + 19d) = 580 + 190d. According to the given information, S_{10} = S_{20}. Hence, we can equate the two expressions: 290 + 45d = 580 + 190d. Solving the equation for d, we get: 145d = 290 Rightarrow d=2. Now, since no specific value of n is provided for calculating the maximum sum, we understand the maximum sum of the arithmetic sequence will be at the point where S_n starts to decrease due to the nature of S_{10} = S_{20}. If d > 0, the sum S_n increases as n increases, but here since S_{10}=S_{20}, and we found d=2, this means after the 20th term, the sum S_n will start decreasing as additional terms will start subtracting a larger amount due to negative terms of the sequence after the 20th term (considering S_{10} = S_{20} signifies the sequence has started to introduce negative numbers and increasing their magnitude). Thus, the maximum sum of the first n terms is S_{20}, which is: S_{20} = 580 + 190d = 580 + 190(2) = 580 + 380 = 960.

Step 1: Analyzing the structure First, let's understand the structure of the annulus and its regions. 1. An annulus is a ring-shaped object, which in this case has been divided into 14 distinct regions. 2. These regions are arranged in such a way that each region is adjacent to at least two other regions (or more depending on the specific division). Step 2: Graph coloring problem This problem can be related to a graph coloring problem, where each region represents a vertex and an edge exists between two vertices if the corresponding regions are adjacent. The goal is to color the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Step 3: Minimum colors for non-planar graph 1. The annulus can be a non-planar graph because of the cyclic nature and possible adjacency of regions from both sides. 2. By the four-color theorem, any planar map (which can be drawn on a flat surface without edges crossing) can be colored using at most 4 colors so that no two adjacent regions share the same color. However, there exist configurations like the one shown that might need more. Step 4: Attempting with fewer colors 1. **Using 3 colors**: We need to consider whether it's possible to color the annulus with just 3 colors: - Let's label the colors as 1, 2, and 3. - Try coloring the regions one by one ensuring no adjacent regions share the same color. If you attempt this, you would find that it is not possible as there will be at least one pair of adjacent regions which will share the same color no matter how you assign the 3 colors. This indicates that 3 colors are not enough. Step 5: Using 4 colors Let's consider using 4 colors. 1. **Using 4 colors**: Label the colors as 1, 2, 3, and 4. Proceed by coloring each region while ensuring no two adjacent regions share the same color. Here is a step-by-step color assignment: - Assign color 1 to the first region. - For each subsequent region, choose from colors 2, 3, or 4 ensuring it does not match the color of any of its adjacent regions.

(It is not necessary to calculate the number of possibilities for each group.)","completion":"Let's consider solving the problem step-by-step. Part (a): Determining the Number of k-Hit Bets 1. We need to calculate how many possible k-hit bets can be generated from 13 matches. 2. To construct a k-hit bet, we first select k matches from the 13. This can be accomplished in binom{13}{k} ways: [ binom{13}{k} = frac{13!}{k!(13-k)!} ] 3. In these k selected matches, we put in the correct results. 4. For the remaining 13 - k matches, each match can have any of the 2 incorrect results. Therefore, for each of these 13 - k matches, there are 2 choices (either of the two incorrect results). Hence, the total number of ways to fill in the incorrect results is: [ 2^{13 - k} ] 5. Combining these, the total number of k-hit bets can be calculated as: [ T_k = binom{13}{k} cdot 2^{13 - k} = frac{13!}{k!(13 - k)!} cdot 2^{13 - k} ] Part (b): Comparing the Number of Bets 1. Next, we need to compare the number of bets for successive values of k to find where the maximum occurs. 2. Specifically, we need to compare T_k and T_{k+1}. To do this, we compute the ratio: [ frac{T_{k+1}}{T_k} = frac{binom{13}{k+1} cdot 2^{13 - (k+1)}}{binom{13}{k} cdot 2^{13 - k}} ] 3. Simplifying the ratio, we get: [ frac{T_{k+1}}{T_k} = frac{frac{13!}{(k+1)!(13-(k+1))!} cdot 2^{12 - k}}{frac{13!}{k!(13 - k)!} cdot 2^{13 - k}} = frac{13 - k}{k+1} cdot frac{1}{2} ] 4. This simplifies further to: [ frac{T_{k+1}}{T_k} = frac{13 - k}{2 (k + 1)} ] 5. We determine when this ratio is greater than, less than, or equal to 1: [ frac{13 - k}{2 (k + 1)} gtrless 1 ] Which simplifies to: [ 13 - k gtrless 2 (k + 1) ] [ 13 - k gtrless 2k + 2 ] [ 13 - 2 gtrless 3k ] [ 11 gtrless 3k ] [ k < frac{11}{3} approx 3.67 ] 6.

We begin by expressing the relationship between the sides in terms of their lengths: 2|AC| = |BC| + |AB| 2. We know the distance between points A and C is: |AC| = |(1, 0) - (-1, 0)| = 2 3. Substituting the expression for |AC| into the initial relationship, we get: 2 times 2 = |BC| + |AB| 4 = |BC| + |AB| 4. This implies that the sum of |BC| and |AB| is greater than |AC|, which means that the points A, B, and C cannot be collinear. 5. Since A and C are the foci of the trajectory, and by the properties of an ellipse, for any point B on the ellipse, the sum of the distances |AB| and |BC| must be constant, and greater than the distance between the foci, vertex B traces out an ellipse with foci at A and C. 6. To find the equation of the ellipse, we consider that A and C are on the x-axis and symmetric about the y-axis. We let 2a be the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci. Thus, in this case, 2a = 4. The center of the ellipse is at the origin (0, 0), and the distance from the center to the foci is c = |AC|/2 = 1. 7. The semi-major axis a is half the sum of the distances, so a = 4/2 = 2 and the semi-minor axis b can be calculated using c^2 = a^2 - b^2: 1 = 2^2 - b^2 b^2 = 2^2 - 1^2 b^2 = 4 - 1 = 3 b = sqrt{3} 8.

We seek to determine whether this deviation from the expected 2020 appearances of heads can be considered random or if it is due to a systematic cause. 2. **Departure Check for Empirical and Theoretical Frequency**: The observed deviation will be considered random if the probability that deviation of the number of heads from 2020 in 4040 tosses is equal to or greater than that observed by Buffon is significantly large. Let m represent the number of heads in 4040 tosses.

Without loss of generality, assume this number is formed from the digits of one specific column. The sum of the digits of this column, hence, is not divisible by 3. 3. **Others are Divisible by 3**: - By assumption, the digits in all other columns (and thus the numbers formed from those columns) sum up to numbers divisible by 3. - Similarly, apply this condition to the rows: in each row, the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. 4. **Sum Analysis**: - Consider the sum of all the digits in the grid. Each of the ten rows yields numbers divisible by 3, implying that their sum, say ( S_r ), is divisible by 3. - Each of the nine columns (excluding the one assumed not divisible by 3), also must therefore yield column sums divisible by 3, implying their total sum ( S_c ) excluding the special column is divisible by 3. 5. **Contradiction**: - If we denote that the special column’s sum of digits as ( S_{nc} ) (not divisible by 3), then the total sum of all digits in the grid, ( S ), can be represented as: [ S = S_r = S_c + S_{nc} ] - Since ( S_r ) is divisible by 3 and ( S_c ) is divisible by 3 but ( S_{nc} ) is not, their combined sum ( S ) would then be non-divisible by 3.

But, [ T equiv -41a^2b + 38a^2c - 41b^2a + 3b^2c + 3c^2b + 38c^2a pmod{M} ] Rewriting the terms, we get: [ T equiv [(-41a^2b + 82b) + (38a^2c - 76c) + (-41b^2a + 1517a) + (3b^2c - 111c) + (3c^2b - 123b) + (38c^2a - 1558a)] + [41a + 41b + 187c] pmod{M} ] Simplifying further: [ T equiv 41a + 41b + 187c equiv 146c pmod{M} ] Thus, ( M mid 146c ). Now, if ( gcd(M, c) = k ), then ( k mid 41 ). Since ( gcd(146, 41) = 1 ), we have ( M mid 146 ). This completes the proof of Lemma 1. (blacksquare) The only factors of ( 146 ) are ( 1, 2, 73, 146 ). Since ( M geq 3 ), we have ( M = 73 ) or ( M = 146 ). # Case 1: ( M = 73 ) We need to find ( a, b, c ) such that: [ a + b + c = 73 ] Given the conditions: [ frac{a^2-2}{x} = frac{b^2-37}{y} = frac{c^2-41}{z} = 73 ] We can solve for ( x, y, z ): [ x = frac{a^2-2}{73}, quad y = frac{b^2-37}{73}, quad z = frac{c^2-41}{73} ] Checking possible values, we find: [ a = 32, quad b = 16, quad c = 25 ] Thus: [ x = frac{32^2-2}{73} = frac{1024-2}{73} = 14 ] [ y = frac{16^2-37}{73} = frac{256-37}{73} = 3 ] [ z = frac{25^2-41}{73} = frac{625-41}{73} = 8 ] So, ( (a, b, c, x, y, z) = (32, 16, 25, 14, 3, 8) ). Thus, ( S = a + b + c + x + y + z = 32 + 16 + 25 + 14 + 3 + 8 = 98 ). # Case 2: ( M = 146 ) We need to find ( a, b, c ) such that: [ a + b + c = 146 ] Given the conditions: [ frac{a^2-2}{x} = frac{b^2-37}{y} = frac{c^2-41}{z} = 146 ] We can solve for ( x, y, z ): [ x = frac{a^2-2}{146}, quad y = frac{b^2-37}{146}, quad z = frac{c^2-41}{146} ] Checking possible values, we find: [ a = 32, quad b = 89, quad c = 25 ] Thus: [ x = frac{32^2-2}{146} = frac{1024-2}{146} = 7 ] [ y = frac{89^2-37}{146} = frac{7921-37}{146} = 54 ] [ z = frac{25^2-41}{146} = frac{625-41}{146} = 4 ] So, ( (a, b, c, x, y, z) = (32, 89, 25, 7, 54, 4) ). Thus, ( S = a + b + c + x + y + z = 32 + 89 + 25 + 7 + 54 + 4 = 211 ). # Conclusion The sum of all possible values of ( S ) is: [ 98 + 211 = boxed{309} ]"},{"prompt":"King Qi and Tian Ji are competing in a horse race.

How many different 8digit numbers can be generated?","completion":"1. Consider the 6 numbers: 2, 0, 1, 9, 20, 19. We need to rearrange them to form an 8-digit number where the first digit is not zero. 2. Our task begins by calculating the total number of possible permutations of these 6 digits when the first digit is non-zero. 3. The first digit can be any of the numbers 2, 1, 9, 20, 19 giving us 5 choices out of the original 6 digits. The rest of the digits can then be arranged in the remaining positions. 4. Therefore, the total number of such permutations is: [ 5 times 5! = 5 times 120 = 600 ] 5. We denote this set of permutations as A, so |A| = 600. 6. Next, we identify and eliminate invalid cases where we must handle permutations where specific digits are placed together. Specifically: - Let B be the set of permutations where the digit 2 is followed directly by the digit 0. - Let C be the set of permutations where the digit 1 is followed directly by the digit 9. - Let D be the set of permutations where the digit 1 follows directly after the digit 9. 7. We calculate the size of these sets: - |B|: Consider 2 followed by 0 as a single block. Now we permute the remaining 4 digits along with this block, giving us 4! permutations: [ |B| = 4! = 24 ] - |C|: Permutations where 2 is followed by 0 and 1 is followed by 9: [ |C| + |B| = 5! ] Rearranging, we find: [ |C| = 5! - |B| = 120 - 24 = 96 ] - |D|: Consider 1 followed by 9 as a single block. Now we permute the remaining 4 digits along with this block: [ |D| = 4 times 4! = 4 times 24 = 96 ] 8. Since the blocks 20, 19, and permutations within B, C, D overlap (as 20 and 19 can be treated as pairs in multiple scenarios), we need to adjust our counts to ensure we only count each valid permutation once: [ |C| = 96, quad |D| = 72, quad text{with overlaps correctly adjusted} ] 9. The final number of valid 8-digit numbers can be calculated by reducing the overlaps: [ |A| - frac{3|B|}{4} - frac{|C|}{2} - frac{|D|}{2} ] Simplifying into the equation: [ 600 - frac{3 times 24}{4} - frac{96}{2} - frac{72}{2} = 600 - 18 - 48 - 36 = 498 ] 10.

(Ⅰ) If proposition neg p is true, find the range of real number a; (Ⅱ) If p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for q, find the range of real number m.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part (Ⅰ) Given that proposition neg p is true, which means that proposition p is false. Hence, the equation x^{2}-2ax+2a^{2}-a-6=0 does not have real roots. The condition for an equation not having real roots is that the discriminant, Delta, is less than 0. We calculate the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation as follows: [ Delta = b^{2}-4ac = (-2a)^{2}-4cdot(2a^{2}-a-6) = 4a^{2}-8a^{2}+4a+24 = -4a^{2}+4a+24 ] For the equation to have no real roots, the discriminant Delta must be less than 0: [ -4a^{2}+4a+24 < 0 ] Solving the inequality, we get: [ a^{2}-a-6 > 0 ] Factoring the quadratic expression, we find: [ (a-3)(a+2) > 0 ] By analyzing the inequality, we find that a < -2 or a > 3. Therefore, the range of the real number a is (-infty, -2) cup (3, +infty). So, we encapsulate the answer as: [ boxed{(-infty, -2) cup (3, +infty)} ] Part (Ⅱ) From part (Ⅰ), we incorrectly concluded that p: -2leq aleq 3, which should be corrected from the context given that p is a necessary condition for q, and q: m-1leq aleq m+3. Since p is not sufficient, it indicates that the range of a for p to be true is a subset of the range for q to be true. Therefore, to correct our approach: - From the correct interpretation of neg p, we know that when p is true, a is not in the range (-infty, -2) cup (3, +infty), but within the range -2 leq a leq 3. Given p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for q, we analyze the conditions for q: [ left{begin{array}{c} m-1geq -2 m+3leq 3 end{array}right. ] Solving these inequalities, we get: [ m geq -1 quad text{and} quad m leq 0 ] Hence, the range of the real number m is [-1,0].

This step helps us systematically approach the problem. 2. **Finding Accessible Cities:** - From the problem statement, given any two cities (P) and (Q), there exists a city (R) from which both (P) and (Q) are accessible. - Start with cities (A_1) and (A_2). By the given condition, there is a city (B_2) (thanks to the existence principle) for which (A_1) and (A_2) are accessible: [ P = A_1, quad Q = A_2 quad Rightarrow quad exists B_2 text{ such that } A_1 leq B_2 text{ and } A_2 leq B_2 ] 3. **Inductive Step:** - Next, consider (A_3) and (B_2).

Solving for x, we find x=a and y=b, thus M(a,b). 2. **Calculating Distances:** - The distance |AM| is found using the distance formula: |AM|=sqrt{(a+a)^2+b^2}=sqrt{4a^2+b^2}. - The distance |OA| is simply a. - The distance |OM| is c. 3. **Using the Inradius of triangle AOM:** - The inradius r is given as frac{ab}{3c}. - The area of triangle AOM can be expressed using the semi-perimeter (s) and the inradius (r): Area = rs = frac{1}{2}(a+c+sqrt{4a^2+b^2})cdotfrac{ab}{3c} = frac{1}{2}ab. - Simplifying, we get sqrt{4a^2+b^2}=2c-a. 4. **Finding the Eccentricity (e):** - We know that c^2=a^2+b^2 for a hyperbola. - Substituting sqrt{4a^2+b^2}=2c-a into c^2=a^2+b^2 and simplifying, we get 3c^2-4ac-2a^2=0. - Since e=frac{c}{a}, we substitute c=ea into the equation to get 3e^2a^2-4e^2a^2-2a^2=0. - Simplifying, we find 3e^2-4e-2=0. - Solving this quadratic equation for e, we get e=frac{2+sqrt{10}}{3} or e=frac{2-sqrt{10}}{3}. Since e>1 for a hyperbola and must be positive, we discard the negative root. Therefore, the eccentricity of the hyperbola C is boxed{frac{2+sqrt{10}}{3}}, which corresponds to option A."},{"prompt":"worker ' s daily wage is increased by 50 % and the new wage is 51 per day . what was the worker ' s daily wage before the increase ?","completion":"To find the worker's daily wage before the increase, we need to determine what 50% increase would result in the new wage of 51 per day. Let's denote the original daily wage as ( W ). A 50% increase of the original wage ( W ) would be ( 0.50 times W ). The new wage is the original wage plus the 50% increase, so we have: ( W + 0.50 times W = 51 ) Combining like terms, we get: ( 1.50 times W = 51 ) Now, we can solve for ( W ) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.50: ( W = frac{51}{1.50} ) ( W = 34 ) So, the worker's daily wage before the increase was boxed{34} per day."},{"prompt":"A regular polygon has an exterior angle that measures 18^circ.

Next, to find the sum of the interior angles of this regular polygon, we use the formula for the sum of interior angles, which is given by: [ 180^circ(n-2) ] Plugging in n = 20 provides: [ 180^circ(20-2) = 180^circ times 18 = 3240^circ ] Thus, the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is boxed{3240^circ}."},{"prompt":"Schools A, B, and C together have a total of 1500 senior high school students, and the number of senior high school students in schools A, B, and C form an arithmetic sequence.

B can give C a 428.57 meters start in a kilometer race. How much start can A give C in a kilometer race?","completion":"Let's denote the speeds of A, B, and C as Va, Vb, and Vc respectively, and the time it takes each of them to complete the race as Ta, Tb, and Tc respectively. Since A can give B a 300 meters start, it means that when A starts running, B is already 300 meters ahead. However, they finish the race at the same time. This implies that A covers 1000 meters in the same time B covers 700 meters. Therefore, we can write the following equation based on their speeds and the time they take to complete their respective distances: Va * Ta = 1000 Vb * Tb = 700 Since they finish at the same time, Ta = Tb. Therefore, we can say that Va/Vb = 1000/700 = 10/7. Now, B can give C a 428.57 meters start, which means B covers 1000 meters in the same time C covers 1000 - 428.57 = 571.43 meters. So we can write: Vb * Tb = 1000 Vc * Tc = 571.43 Since Tb = Tc, we can say that Vb/Vc = 1000/571.43 ≈ 1.75. Now, we want to find out how much start A can give C. We know the ratio of A's speed to B's speed and B's speed to C's speed. To find the ratio of A's speed to C's speed, we multiply the two ratios: Va/Vc = (Va/Vb) * (Vb/Vc) = (10/7) * (1.75) = 25/7. This means that A is 25/7 times faster than C. If they were to race, A would cover 1000 meters in the same time C covers 7/25 of that distance. So, the distance C would cover when A finishes the race is: 1000 * (7/25) = 280 meters.

Given (n) points, consider a line (ell) containing two points (A) and (B) with all other points on one side. - Applying the induction hypothesis to the (n-2) remaining points, we require (leftlfloor frac{n-2}{2} rightrfloor) lines. Adding back (A) and (B), we solve: - If (A) and (B) are the same color, separate with a line parallel to (ell). - If (A) and (B) are different colors and already separated, the configuration holds. - If (A) and (B) share a region, the region contains no other points of the same color hence separating with one additional line suffices. - Therefore, (leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor) lines suffice, concluding that (k = 2013) is exact for 4027 points.

Consider a cube inscribed in a sphere, where the edges of the cube are aligned with three mutually perpendicular planes that are symmetrical about the center of the sphere. The intersection of these planes with the sphere forms great circles, dividing the sphere's surface into 8 congruent spherical triangles. 2. Observing these spherical triangles reveals that their sides are equal to one fourth of a great circle's circumference. Hence, every face of the cube corresponds to one of these spherical triangles. 3. The vertices of the cube are at the centers of these spherical triangles, which are identified as the intersection points of great circles running through the midpoints of the opposite sides of the spherical triangles. Specifically, let's denote the planes by ( S_1 ), ( S_2 ), and ( S_3 ). Plane ( S_1 ) intersects plane ( S_2 ) and plane ( S_3 ) at right angles, and similar intersections occur between ( S_2 ) and ( S_3 ), and between ( S_3 ) and ( S_1 ). 4. Hence, to find a cube's vertices: - Draw a great circle ( k_1 ) on the sphere. Mark points ( 0^circ, 90^circ, 180^circ ), and ( 270^circ ) on this circle. Label them as ( A, B, A^*, B^* ), respectively, where ( A^* ) and ( B^* ) are antipodal to ( A ) and ( B ). - ( A ) and ( A^* ), and ( B ) and ( B^* ) are the endpoints of two diameters of the sphere ( AA^* ) and ( BB^* ) that are perpendicular to each other. 5. Next, draw another great circle ( k_2 ) through ( A, A^*, C, ) and ( C^* ) such that this circle is perpendicular to ( k_1 ). Through similar steps by marking ( 90^circ ) and ( 270^circ ) points, we can denote ( C ) and ( C^* ) on ( k_2 ). 6. Lastly, we introduce the third great circle ( k_3 ) going through ( DD^* ) on points ( 90^circ ) and ( 270^circ ) of ( A ) on ( k_2 ). This gives us points ( D ) and ( D^* ). Now, ( AA^* ) will be perpendicular to both ( BB^* ) and ( DD^* ). 7. The intersection points of these great circles provide the midpoints of the spherical triangles. By connecting these midpoints to the opposite vertices, we create a new set of great circles connecting these points. This process ensures that each edge of a spherical triangle is halved. 8. The intersection points obtained from steps 4 to 7 give the vertices of the cube, ensuring eight equal spherical triangles on the sphere. # Conclusion: By following the above construction steps, we determine the vertices of the cube inscribed in the sphere using the specified 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270° points.

Each base edge is parallel to exactly one opposite edge. Hence, there are 2 pairs of parallel edges. 3. **Intersecting Edges**: - Each base edge intersects with two adjacent base edges (at the vertices) and two edges connecting the apex to the base vertices (forming triangles). - Each edge from the apex to a base vertex intersects with its two adjacent triangular edges and potentially the adjacent base edges (forming more triangles). 4. **Counting Pairs**: - From the base: Each base edge pairs with 2 adjacent base edges and 2 connecting apex edges, leading to 4 pairs per base edge. Since there are 4 base edges, and each intersection is counted twice, this results in frac{4 times 4}{2} = 8 pairs from the base edges considering intersections. - Each triangular edge creates 2 adjacent triangular pairs and might intersect with 2 base edges, resulting in 4 pairs per triangular edge. There are 4 triangular edges, counted twice, resulting in frac{4 times 4}{2} = 8 pairs from triangular intersections. 5. **Total Valid Pairs**: Adding the pairs, we get 2 (parallel pairs) + 8 (base-intersecting pairs) + 8 (triangular-intersecting pairs) = 18. 6. **Conclusion**: The number of unordered pairs of edges that determine a plane in a square pyramid is 18.

So, the amount she had after buying the video game minus the amount she spent on the goggles equals 60: (3/4)M - (1/5) * (3/4)M = 60 To find out how much money she had before buying the goggles, we need to solve for (3/4)M: Let's first simplify the expression on the left side: (3/4)M - (3/20)M = 60 To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator, which would be 20 in this case.

Let angle A = alpha, which leads to angle C = 120^circ + alpha. Let BD and BE be the altitude and angle bisector from vertex B respectively. 1. We start by expressing all angles in terms of alpha. Since the sum of the internal angles of the triangle is 180^circ, we have: [ angle A + angle B + angle C = 180^circ ] Substituting angle A and angle C: [ alpha + angle B + (120^circ + alpha) = 180^circ ] Simplifying the equation: [ 2alpha + angle B + 120^circ = 180^circ ] [ angle B = 60^circ - 2alpha ] 2.

Considering triangle BEC, specifically looking at angle BEC and angle CBE, we can determine angle BEC using the property of angles in a triangle summing to 180^circ: [ angle BEC = 180^circ - angle C - angle CBE ] Substituting the known values: [ angle BEC = 180^circ - (120^circ + alpha) - (30^circ - alpha) ] Simplifying: [ angle BEC = 180^circ - 120^circ - 30^circ = 30^circ ] 4.

The sum of all the numbers written by Anton was equal to 1243. What number could Timur have thought of? Provide all possible options and prove that there are no others.","completion":"1. Let Timur's original three-digit number be represented as ( abc ), where ( a, b, ) and ( c ) are its digits. 2. When Anton writes three numbers, we create them by replacing each digit with 1 one at a time: - Replace ( a ) with 1: ( 1bc ) - Replace ( b ) with 1: ( a1c ) - Replace ( c ) with 1: ( ab1 ) 3. The sum of these numbers will be: [ 1bc + a1c + ab1 ] 4. Next, we express these three numbers in standard form (each digit in its correct positional value): - ( 1bc = 100 + 10b + c ) - ( a1c = 100a + 10 + c ) - ( ab1 = 100a + 10b + 1 ) 5. Adding them together: [ 1bc + a1c + ab1 = (100 + 10b + c) + (100a + 10 + c) + (100a + 10b + 1) ] 6. Simplify the addition by combining like terms: [ = (100a + 100a) + (10b + 10b) + (c + c) + (100) + (10) + (1) ] [ = 200a + 20b + 2c + 111 ] 7. It's given that the sum of these numbers is 1243: [ 200a + 20b + 2c + 111 = 1243 ] 8. Subtract 111 from both sides to isolate the combined terms: [ 200a + 20b + 2c = 1243 - 111 ] [ 200a + 20b + 2c = 1132 ] 9. Factor out the common factor of 2 from all terms: [ 2(100a + 10b + c) = 1132 ] 10. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for ( 100a + 10b + c ), which is the original number ( abc ): [ 100a + 10b + c = frac{1132}{2} ] [ 100a + 10b + c = 566 ] 11. Thus, the original number Timur thought of is: [ boxed{566} ] 12.

Since the perimeter of the quadrilateral with diagonals equal to the major and minor axes of the ellipse E is 4sqrt{5}, we deduce: 4sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 2 sqrt{5a} = 4sqrt{5}, which gives us a = 2 and therefore b = 1.

If two people have a conversation, draw an edge between the corresponding vertices. Hence, we have a simple graph ( G ) with ( |V| = 21 ) and ( |E| = n ). 2. **Using Conditions**: Given that every pair of people talks at most once, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of edges ( n ) such that if ( G ) has an odd cycle, it must contain a triangle (a cycle of length 3). 3. **Odd Cycle and Triangle**: We need to show that if ( G ) has ( n geq 102 ) edges and contains an odd cycle, it will also contain a triangle. 4. **Case Analysis**: Assume ( G ) has the smallest odd cycle ( C ) of length ( 2k + 1 ). - If ( k = 1 ), then ( C ) is a triangle itself and our task is complete. - If ( k geq 2 ), let ( C ) be the cycle ( v_1 v_2 ldots v_{2k+1} v_1 ). None of the non-adjacent vertices within ( C ) should have an edge, else a shorter odd cycle would exist, contradicting the minimality of ( C ). 5. **Excluding Non-Cycle Edges**: Assume other (21 - (2k+1) = 20 - 2k ) vertices do not form a triangle with vertices in ( C ). 6. **Turán's Theorem Application**: According to Turán's theorem, the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on ( n ) vertices is at most ( leftlfloor frac{n^2}{4} rightrfloor ). For ( 20 - 2k ) vertices, this is ((10-k)^2). 7. **Combining Edges and Vertices**: The total number of edges in ( G ) should be, [ (2k+1) + (10-k)^2 + (20-2k)k = 102 - (k-1)^2 < 102 ] This inequality contradicts the possibility of having no triangles when ( G ) has 102 edges since it should hold for every configuration. 8. **Constructing a Graph with 101 Edges**: Construct a counterexample with 101 edges.

Vertices in (Q) connect with (A_1, A_3), and vertices in (R) with (A_2, A_4). 10. **Edge Count**: - Edges within (P): 5 edges. - Edges across (Q) and (R): (8 times 8 = 64) edges. - Edges from (Q) to (A_1, A_3): (2 times 8 = 16) edges. - Edges from (R) to (A_2, A_4): (2 times 8 = 16) edges.

The area of the triangle formed by the line and the coordinate axes is: text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. The base of the triangle is the distance along the y-axis from the point (0, 2 + 2m) to the origin, which is |2 + 2m| (assuming the line is in the second quadrant, m is negative, so the absolute value ensures a positive distance). The height of the triangle is the x-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the x-axis (y=0). Here, 0 = mx + 2 + 2m, so the x-intercept is x = -frac{2 + 2m}{m}. Again, since we are in the second quadrant, and m is negative, the x-coordinate is positive, and the absolute value is not needed: text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times |2 + 2m| times left(-frac{2 + 2m}{m}right).

We need to calculate the derivative of f(m). f'(m) = frac{d}{dm}left( (2 + 2m)^2 left(-frac{1}{m}right) right). Using the product rule and chain rule: f'(m) = 2(2 + 2m) cdot 2 cdot left(-frac{1}{m}right) + (2 + 2m)^2 left(frac{1}{m^2}right). Simplifying: f'(m) = -frac{4(2 + 2m)}{m} + frac{(2 + 2m)^2}{m^2}. To find the critical points, we set f'(m) = 0: -frac{4(2 + 2m)}{m} + frac{(2 + 2m)^2}{m^2} = 0.

Now we can try to find the critical points again: -frac{4(2 + 2m)}{m} + frac{4(2 + 2m)}{m^2} = 0. Multiplying by m^2 to clear the denominator: -4m(2 + 2m) + 4(2 + 2m) = 0.

We are given two numbers from the expression below and we need to find a third number such that the sum of these three numbers equals their product: [ frac{a+b}{1-ab}, quad frac{b+c}{bc-1} ] 2. Let's denote the two given numbers by ( E ) and ( M ): [ E=frac{a+b}{1-ab}, quad M=frac{b+c}{bc-1} ] 3. The next step is to find a third number ( H ) such that: [ E + M + H = E cdot M cdot H ] 4. Rearranging the equation, we get: [ H = frac{E+M}{EM-1} ] 5.

This means that the payments form a geometric sequence where the first term (a1) is 100 and the common ratio (r) is 3. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is: S_n = a1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r) However, we have a fractional number of months (8.93), which doesn't make sense in the context of monthly payments, as you can't make a partial payment based on this progression.

Let the smallest row sum be ( 2^a ). The sum of the numbers ( 1, 2, cdots, k ) is given by [ sum_{i=1}^{k} i = frac{k(k+1)}{2}. ] So we have: [ 2^a geq frac{k(k+1)}{2}. ] 4. The total sum of all numbers in the grid is [ sum_{i=1}^{k^2} i = frac{k^2(k^2 + 1)}{2}. ] 5. Since there are ( k ) rows, each with sum ( 2^a ), the total sum must also be ( k times 2^a ). Therefore, we must have: [ k times 2^a = frac{k^2(k^2 + 1)}{2}. ] 6. For this equality to hold, ( 2^a ) must divide ( frac{k^2(k^2 + 1)}{2} ). 7. Consider the case when ( k ) is odd.

Therefore, ( 2^a ) must still divide ( frac{k^2}{2} ). 9.

Step 1: Understanding the formula for annual savings interest, which is given by the product of the principal, the annual interest rate (in decimal form), and the number of years. The formula is Interest = P times Rate times T. Step 2: Since the total amount at maturity includes both the principal and the interest earned, we can express the total amount (A) as the sum of the principal (P) and the interest. Thus, A = P + (P times Rate times T). Step 3: Substituting the given values into the equation, we have the total amount at maturity (3243) equal to the principal (3000) plus the product of the principal, the annual interest rate in decimal form (x% = frac{x}{100}), and the number of years (3).

But considering the function's behavior and the given solution, we note that the derivative's sign was misinterpreted in the explanation. The correct interpretation should focus on the function's monotonicity due to the derivative's properties. Thus, we correct the approach as follows: {f'}(x) = 2x(e^{x}-1) is always non-negative because for x > 0, e^x > 1, making the product 2x(e^x - 1) positive, and for x = 0, 2x(e^x - 1) = 0.

Given f(0) = 2a^{2}-2 < 0 and analyzing f(ln a), we find that f(ln a) < 0 due to the properties of the function g(x) = (ln x)^{2}-2ln x-2x+2 being monotonically decreasing in (0,1). Therefore, f(x) has no root in (-infty, 0). For x > 0, since e^x > x^2, and given f(x) > x^2(2x-2-a), we find that f(x) has exactly one root x_0 in (0, +infty) because f(x) is monotonically increasing for x > 0.

Since the count of raspberries has always been odd and it only decreases by 2, which still preserves oddness, the only solution is: - **One single raspberry will remain at the end** when all actions that can be performed have been exhausted.

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, such an ( x ) always exists because the moduli ( p_1, p_2, dots, p_k ) are pairwise coprime. 4. **Define the sequence**: Consider the sequence of rational numbers ( frac{a_i}{b_i} ) where ( a_i = x + i ) and ( b_i = frac{N}{p_i} ) for ( i = 1, 2, dots, k ). 5. **Check distinctness of ( b_i )**: Since ( b_i = frac{N}{p_i} ) and ( N = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k ), it follows that ( b_i = p_1 p_2 cdots p_{i-1} p_{i+1} cdots p_k ). Because each ( p_i ) is distinct, each ( b_i ) is distinct. 6. **Check distinctness of ( a_i )**: Suppose ( a_i = a_j ) for some ( i < j ). Then: [ x + i = x + j implies i = j, ] which is a contradiction. Therefore, all ( a_i ) are distinct. 7. **Relatively prime condition**: Since ( a_i = x + i ) and ( b_i = frac{N}{p_i} ), we need to check that ( gcd(a_i, b_i) = 1 ). Note that ( b_i ) is a product of all primes except ( p_i ), and ( x + i equiv 0 pmod{p_i} ).

According to the information given, Marcia bought double the number of pencils as Cindi did, so Marcia bought ( 2P ) pencils. Donna bought 3 times as many pencils as Marcia did, so Donna bought ( 3 times 2P = 6P ) pencils. Together, Donna and Marcia bought 480 pencils, so we can write the equation: ( 6P + 2P = 480 ) Combining like terms, we get: ( 8P = 480 ) Dividing both sides by 8 to solve for ( P ), we find: ( P = frac{480}{8} ) ( P = 60 ) So, Cindi bought 60 pencils. Since Cindi spent 30 on 60 pencils, we can find the cost of each pencil by dividing the total cost by the number of pencils: Cost per pencil = ( frac{Total Cost}{Number of Pencils} ) Cost per pencil = ( frac{30}{60} ) Cost per pencil = 0.50 Therefore, each pencil Cindi bought cost boxed{0.50} ."},{"prompt":"The positive integers M and M^2 both end in the same sequence of five digits abcde when written in base 10, where digit a is not zero.

Similar to the previous example, one of these numbers must end in a digit that makes the product M(M-1) divisible by 100000. If M is divisible by 32, then M-1 should be divisible by 3125. Since 3125 equiv 25 pmod{32}, we can find M by solving M equiv 0 pmod{32} and M equiv 1 pmod{3125}. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem: [M-1 equiv 24 pmod{32},] thus M-1 = 3125k + 24 for some integer k satisfying 3125k + 24 equiv 0 pmod{32}.

Therefore, the amount of milk in the new mixture will also be (frac{3}{7}x + y). But we know that the amount of milk in drink A is (frac{4}{7}x), so we have: [frac{4}{7}x = frac{3}{7}x + y] We are given that ( y = 14 ) liters (the amount of fruit juice needed for the conversion), so we can substitute ( y ) into the equation: [frac{4}{7}x = frac{3}{7}x + 14] Now, let's solve for ( x ): [frac{4}{7}x - frac{3}{7}x = 14] [frac{1}{7}x = 14] [x = 14 times 7] [x = 98] So, 98 liters of drink A is needed.

This implies that 7a = 9b, and hence a must be a multiple of 9 (since 7 and 9 are coprime). We write a = 9k for some integer k. As 200 < n < 300, we find that 200 < 7a < 300. Substituting a = 9k, we get 200 < 63k < 300, which simplifies to frac{200}{63} < k < frac{300}{63}. This further simplifies to approximately 3.17 < k < 4.76. Since k must be an integer, the possible values for k are 4. For k = 4, we substitute back to find a = 9 times 4 = 36, and thus n = 7 times 36 + r = 252 + r. Given that 0 leq r leq 6, the possible values for n are 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258. Among these, only 252 to 258 fall within the range 200 < n < 300.

If at this point there are k students P_{1}, P_{2}, cdots, P_{k} such that P_{k} has never sent a card to P_{1}, and P_{i} has never sent a card to P_{i+1} for i=1, 2, cdots, k1, then these k students initially prepared the same number of greeting cards.","completion":"The given problem involves proving two key points about n students exchanging cards according to specific rules. We will use the names P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n to denote these n students. Let's denote the initial count of cards prepared by each student as p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n and the final count of each student's cards as q_1, q_2, ldots, q_n. 1. **Proof of Existence of Cards:** First, we need to show that if there comes a point when no student can send a card following the given rules, then each student must have at least one card. Suppose, at the final moment, a student P_i has never sent a card to another student P_j. This implies all cards in P_i's possession are signed by P_j. **Case Analysis:** - If q_i > 0, then P_i has cards but has not sent any to P_j, thus violating the rules unless P_i has only cards from P_j. 2. **Using Sets and Invariants:** Consider any subset of students V_0 subseteq V = {P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n}. - r_{V_0}: Number of letters yet to be sent from V_0 to V setminus V_0. - s_{V_0}: Number of letters yet to be sent from V setminus V_0 to V_0. - m_{V_0}: Total number of cards in V_0. Note that by the end of each day, one of the following must happen: - (i) Both r_{V_0} and m_{V_0} decrease by 1, and s_{V_0} remains unchanged, or - (ii) s_{V_0} decreases by 1, m_{V_0} increases by 1, and r_{V_0} remains unchanged, or - (iii) None of r_{V_0}, s_{V_0}, or m_{V_0} changes. Therefore, the quantity m_{V_0} - r_{V_0} + s_{V_0} remains constant over time. Initially, let p(V_0) denote all cards in V_0, and q(V_0) denote all cards at the final state. [ left| p(V_0) right| = sum_{P_i in V_0} p_i ] [ left| q(V_0) right| = sum_{P_i in V_0} q_i ] We know that, [ left| p(V_0) right| = left| q(V_0) right| - r_{V_0} + s_{V_0} ] 3. **Proof by Contradiction:** Assume there exists a subset V_0 subset V such that q(V_0) subset p(V_0). This results in: [ left| q(V_0) right| < left| p(V_0) right| ] Hence, [ s_{V_0} > r_{V_0} geq 0 ] Then there must be a student P_{i_1} in V_0 and another student P_{j_1} in V setminus V_0 such that P_{j_1} has never sent a card to P_{i_1}. This process can repeat indefinitely, leading to a contradiction. 4. **Non-Zero q_i:** Suppose there exists a student P_i such that q_i = 0. Let V_0 = {P_i}. Then, [ q(V_0) subset p(V_0) ] Which contradicts our logical derivation. Thus, every q_i neq 0. 5. **Equality and Final Count:** Let V_0 = {P_1, P_2, ldots, P_k}, noting q({P_i}) subseteq p({P_{i+1}}), meaning, [ q_1 leq p_2, q_2 leq p_3, ldots, q_k leq p_1 ] Hence, from the principle, [ q(V_0) = p(V_0) ] Thus, [ q_1 = p_2, q_2 = p_3, ldots, q_k = p_1 ] With this, we arrive at: [ p_1 = p_2 = cdots = p_k ] Thus, we conclude with the boxed notation: [ boxed{p_1 = p_2 = ldots = p_k} ]"},{"prompt":"w many lattice points lie on the hyperbola x^2 y^2 = 1800^2?","completion":"Given the equation x^2 - y^2 = 1800^2, we can express it as: [ (x-y)(x+y) = 1800^2 = 2^4 cdot 3^4 cdot 5^4 ] Both (x-y) and (x+y) must be even, so we can factor out 2 from each, leaving 2^2 cdot 3^4 cdot 5^4.
