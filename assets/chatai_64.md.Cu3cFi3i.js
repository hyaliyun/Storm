We take some direction ( ell ) and construct two lines ( ell_1 ) and ( ell_2 ) parallel to ( ell ) with the smallest distance between them, such that ( P ) is inside the band between ( ell_1 ) and ( ell_2 ). Clearly, both ( ell_1 ) and ( ell_2 ) have common points with ( P ) (possibly common sides). 2. **Define the band ( B_{ell} ):** Denote the band/region between ( ell_1 ) and ( ell_2 ) as ( B_{ell} ).

From the first given equation: [ E_1: a^4 b^3 c^5 = 18 ] From the second given equation: [ E_2: a^3 b^5 c^4 = 8 ] # Step 2: Equate the exponents to simplify equation. Let's raise E_1 to the power of 3 and E_2 to the power of 4, so we make the exponents of a, b, and c comparable: [ (a^4 b^3 c^5)^3 = 18^3 ] [ a^{12} b^9 c^{15} = 18^3 ] [ (a^3 b^5 c^4)^4 = 8^4 ] [ a^{12} b^{20} c^{16} = 8^4 ] # Step 3: Divide the equations to eliminate some variables. Now, divide the first result by the second result: [ frac{a^{12} b^9 c^{15}}{a^{12} b^{20} c^{16}} = frac{18^3}{8^4} ] Simplify the exponents: [ b^{-11} c^{-1} = frac{18^3}{8^4} ] Simplify the constants: [ b^{-11} c^{-1} = frac{5832}{4096} ] [ b^{-11} c^{-1} = frac{81}{64} ] # Step 4: Express b^{11}c in terms of a simplified fraction. [ b^{11} c = frac{64}{81} ] # Step 5: Substitute b^{11} c = frac{64}{81}. We now need to find: [ k = a^5 b c^6 ] We use our initial E_1 and E_2 to simplify the term a^5 b c^6 against their combined worth. [ (a^4 b^3 c^5) cdot (a^3 b^5 c^4) cdot b^{-6}c^{-3} = 18 cdot 8 cdot b^{-6}c^{-3} ] Simplify the above: [ a^7 b^3 c^4 cdot b^{-6}c^{-3} = 144 cdot b^{-6}c^{-3}] [ a^7 b^{-3} c = 144 ] We want a^5 b c^6. [ frac{a^7 b^{-3} c}{a^{7-5}b^{-3+1}c^{1-6}} = 144 ] [ a^5 (b c^6) = k ] Which means k must be determined from simplified values [ k = 40.5 div 4 / 64 ] Final expression simplifies eliminates term.

A cube has 6 sides, and each side of the cube is a square with each side measuring 10 feet.

To find out how many kilograms of paint are needed to cover 600 square feet, we divide the total surface area by the coverage of 1 kilogram of paint: Kilograms of paint needed = Total surface area / Coverage per kilogram Kilograms of paint needed = 600 square feet / 20 square feet per kilogram Kilograms of paint needed = 30 kilograms The cost of paint is 60 per kilogram, so the total cost to paint the cube is: Total cost = Kilograms of paint needed x Cost per kilogram Total cost = 30 kilograms x 60 per kilogram Total cost = 1800 Therefore, it will cost boxed{1800} to paint the outside of the cube."},{"prompt":"e hour , a boat goes 11 km along the stream and 5 km against it . find the speed of the boat in still water","completion":"Let's denote the speed of the boat in still water as ( b ) km/h and the speed of the stream as ( s ) km/h.

By definition, each pair of opposite sides of the quadrilateral intersects at a point that lies on the circle. 5. **Step 3:** Since the distances of the chords from the center ( O ) are equal, the quadrilateral ( ABCD ) can be inscribed in a circle. The distance from the center of the circle to the chords is radius ( r ). 6. **Step 4:** By the properties of a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral that can be inscribed in a circle), the sums of the lengths of opposite sides are equal. This property uses Ptolemy's theorem which states that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the products of its two pairs of opposite sides is equal to the product of its diagonals.

To transform it into the standard form, we compare it to x^{2}=frac{1}{4p}y, which gives us x^{2}=frac{1}{2}y. This means that 4p=2, so p=frac{1}{2}. 2. **Determine the direction of the parabola and the value of p**: Since the coefficient of y in x^{2}=frac{1}{2}y is positive, the parabola opens upwards. We have found that p=frac{1}{2}, but to correct the calculation, we see that p should actually be frac{1}{4} because 4p=2 leads to p=frac{1}{2}, and thus, the correct interpretation should be 2p=frac{1}{2}, which means p=frac{1}{4}. 3. **Find the coordinates of the focus and the equation of the directrix**: For a parabola that opens upwards, the focus is at (0, p) and the directrix is y=-p. Therefore, the focus is at F(0, frac{1}{4}) (correcting the earlier mistake), and the equation of the directrix is y=-frac{1}{4}. 4. **Calculate the distance from the focus to the directrix**: The distance from the focus (0, frac{1}{4}) to the directrix y=-frac{1}{4} is simply the difference in their y-coordinates, which is frac{1}{4} - (-frac{1}{4}) = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the correct distance from the focus of the parabola to the directrix is boxed{frac{1}{2}}.

Therefore, the axis of symmetry is at x=1. Since the parabola opens upwards and the axis of symmetry is at x=1, we know that for any x value to the right of x=1, the y value increases as x increases. This is due to the nature of a parabola that opens upwards. Given the points P_{1}(-1,y_{1}), P_{2}(frac{5}{2},y_{2}), and P_{3}(6,y_{3}), we can observe their positions relative to the axis of symmetry at x=1. The point P_{1}(-1,y_{1}) is to the left of the axis of symmetry. Due to the symmetry of the parabola, the point symmetric to P_{1} across the axis of symmetry would have an x-coordinate of 3 (since -1 is 2 units to the left of 1, the symmetric point would be 2 units to the right of 1, which is 3).

Start with the original equation: y=x^{2}-4x+3. 2.

Substitute these expressions into the initial condition: [ 100a + 10b + c = 8(10b + c) ] 4. Expand this equation: [ 100a + 10b + c = 80b + 8c ] 5. Isolate the terms involving a, b, and c on one side of the equation: [ 100a + 10b + c - 80b - 8c = 0 ] 6. Simplify the equation: [ 100a - 70b - 7c = 0 ] 7. We can rewrite this equation in a more convenient form: [ 100a = 70b + 7c ] 8. Notice that the right-hand side of the equation is a multiple of 7, meaning 100a must also be a multiple of 7. Since a is a digit (1 through 9), the only value that makes 100a a multiple of 7 is a = 7. Thus, [ 100 times 7 = 70b + 7c ] simplifies to: [ 700 = 70b + 7c ] 9. Dividing the entire equation by 7 we get: [ 100 = 10b + c ] 10. Here, 100 = 10b + c implies that b and c must satisfy the equation in such a way that 10b + c results in a two-digit number, but 100 is not a valid two-digit number. This leads to a contradiction because 10b + c is supposed to represent a two-digit number given b and c are digits (0-9). 11. Therefore, our assumption that there exists a three-digit number overline{abc} such that overline{abc} = 8 cdot overline{bc} leads to a contradiction.

We need to select several stones such that the total mass of the selected stones differs as little as possible from 10 kg.

The total weight of these stones is: [ 55 times frac{20}{11} = 100 , text{kg} ] Now, select stones to get a sum close to 10 kg. If we select 5 stones: [ 5 times frac{20}{11} = frac{100}{11} approx 9.09 , text{kg} ] If we select 6 stones: [ 6 times frac{20}{11} = frac{120}{11} approx 10.91 , text{kg} ] The deviation from 10 kg will be: [ left| 9.09 - 10 right| = frac{10}{11} , text{kg} ] or: [ left| 10.91 - 10 right| = frac{10}{11} , text{kg} ] Thus, the deviation d is frac{10}{11} in this example. 2. **General Case and Proof By Contradiction:** Assume there exists a set of stones with weights x_1 geq x_2 geq ldots geq x_n, where the deviation d exceeds frac{10}{11}.

To find X, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The total number of people who like either sports or literary and artistic activities, or both, is the sum of people who like sports and those who like literary and artistic activities minus the number of people who like both (since those are counted twice in the sum of the first two groups). Then, we subtract the number of people who do not like either from the total number of employees to find the number of people who like both sports and literary and artistic activities. However, since we are only looking for the number of people who like sports but not literary and artistic activities, we subtract the number of people who like both activities from the number of people who like sports. Given that the total number of people who do not like either activity is 12, the number of people who like either sports or literary and artistic activities, or both, is 60 - 12 = 48.

Since T=2 is a period of y=f(x), we can derive that f(1+x)=f[(x+1)-2], Therefore, f(1-x)=f(x-1), which means f(1-x)=f[-(1-x)], By substituting x for 1-x, we get f(x)=f(-x), hence the function y=f(x) is an even function. ③ Finally, prove that condition (2) holds when conditions (1) and (3) are given as premises Since T=2 is a period of y=f(x), we have f(1+x)=f[(x+1)-2]=f(x-1), Since y=f(x) is an even function, we can derive that f(x-1)=f(1-x), Therefore, the function y=f(x) satisfies f(1-x)=f(1+x), indicating that the graph of y=f(x) is symmetric about the line x=1. In summary, taking any two of the conditions (1), (2), and (3) as premises and the remaining one as a conclusion, three true propositions can be formed.

Each minute on the clock represents 6 degrees (since there are 360 degrees in a circle and 60 minutes in an hour, 360/60 = 6 degrees per minute). Therefore, the minute hand is 40 * 6 = 240 degrees from the top of the clock (0 minutes). Now, we need to find the position of the hour hand. Since the angle between the hour and minute hands is 130 degrees, we can calculate the position of the hour hand relative to the top of the clock. If we assume the minute hand is at the 40-minute mark (240 degrees), and the angle between the hour and minute hands is 130 degrees, we can subtract the angle from the minute hand's position to find the hour hand's position: 240 degrees (minute hand) - 130 degrees (angle) = 110 degrees This means the hour hand is 110 degrees from the top of the clock. Each hour on the clock represents 30 degrees (since there are 12 hours on a clock and 360 degrees in a circle, 360/12 = 30 degrees per hour). To find the hour that the hour hand is pointing to, we divide the degrees by the degrees per hour: 110 degrees / 30 degrees per hour ≈ 3.67 hours Since the hour hand is pointing to approximately 3.67 hours past the hour, it is pointing just past the 3 on the clock face, between the 3 and the 4. To be more precise, since 0.67 of an hour is 40 minutes (because 0.67 * 60 minutes = boxed{40.2} minutes), the hour hand is pointing roughly 2/3 of the way from the 3 to the 4 on the clock face."},{"prompt":"What is the ratio of ( x ) to ( y ) if ( frac{15x 4y}{18x 3y} = frac{2}{3} )?

The properties of sine and cosine in a unit circle tell us that the coordinates of a point at 225^circ (which is the 45^circ in the third quadrant) are reflections of the point at 45^circ in the first quadrant, across the origin. Since the coordinates of a point at 45^circ are left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right), then the coordinates for 225^circ will be left(-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right).

Prove this.","completion":"To prove that the coefficient ( a ) in the quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c + p = 0 ) must be equal to zero for all roots to be positive and real for any positive ( p ), we can consider the following steps: 1. **Consider the Quadratic Discriminant:** The general form of a quadratic equation is: [ ax^2 + bx + (c + p) = 0 ] where the discriminant ( D ) is given by: [ D = b^2 - 4a(c + p) ] For the quadratic equation to have real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative: [ b^2 - 4a(c + p) geq 0 ] 2. **Case ( a > 0 ):** Suppose ( a > 0 ). For large positive ( p ), the term ( 4a(c + p) ) will dominate, making the discriminant: [ D = b^2 - 4a(c + p) ] As ( p ) becomes very large, ( -4ap ) becomes very large and negative: [ b^2 - 4a(c + p) < 0 quad text{for large } p ] This implies ( D ) becomes negative, meaning the quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c + p = 0 ) does not have real roots for large ( p ). This contradicts the condition that all roots should be real for any positive ( p ). Therefore, ( a ) cannot be greater than zero. 3. **Case ( a < 0 ):** Suppose ( a < 0 ). For large positive ( p ), the term ( 4a(c + p) ) again dominates, but this time: [ D = b^2 - 4a(c + p) ] will remain positive since ( -4a ) is positive and hence ( D > 0 ). Thus, the equation ( ax^2 + bx + c + p = 0 ) will have real roots. However: - For the roots to be positive, the product of the roots ((x_1 cdot x_2)) must be positive. From Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 ) is given by: [ x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{c + p}{a} ] Since ( a < 0 ) and ( c + p ) is always positive when ( p ) is sufficiently large, ( frac{c + p}{a} ) becomes negative, implying that the product of the roots is negative. Hence one of the roots must be negative, which contradicts the requirement for both roots to be positive and real. Therefore, ( a ) cannot be less than zero. 4. **Case ( a = 0 ):** If ( a = 0 ), the equation reduces to: [ bx + c + p = 0 ] Solving for ( x ), we get: [ x = -frac{c + p}{b} ] For ( x ) to be positive for any positive ( p ): [ -frac{c + p}{b} > 0 ] which implies ( b < 0 ) and ( c + p < 0 ). For large positive ( p ), ( c + p ) is always positive, which ensures that ( x ) is a negative number. Thus, for positive ( p ), we again reach a contradiction.

It is a moderately difficult problem. First, deduce that f(x+5)=f(x) from the given conditions, then find f(2016)=f(1). Utilize the definition of an odd function to convert this into an inequality, and subsequently solve it. **Step-by-step solution:** 1. Since f(x+ frac{5}{2})f(x)=1, it follows that f(x+ frac{5}{2}+ frac{5}{2})f(x+ frac{5}{2})=1, 2. Thus, f(x+5)=f(x), and consequently, f(x+5k)=f(x), where k in mathbb{Z}. Therefore, f(2016)=f(1). 3. As f(x) is an odd function, f(1)=-f(-1). Given that f(-1) > 1, it follows that -f(1) > 1, hence f(1) < -1. 4. Since f(2016)= frac{a+3}{a-3}, we have frac{a+3}{a-3} < -1. 5. Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain frac{a+3}{a-3} + 1 < 0, which simplifies to frac{2a}{a-3} < 0, or a(a-3) < 0. Solving this inequality yields 0 < a < 3.

The Apollonius Circle for a line segment (BC) is the locus of points that maintain a constant ratio of distances to the endpoints (B) and (C). 3. **Key Observation**: - If (BP:PC) maintains the same ratio as (frac{BD}{DC} = frac{3}{5}), Bob can find another point (Q) that satisfies the same ratio. - Hence, (AP) needs to be tangent to this Apollonius Circle. 4. **Application of Apollonius Circle Properties**: - By properties of the Apollonius Circle and triangle similarity, the critical ratios can be obtained. 5. **Finding the Tangent Line Ratios**: - Let (AP) be tangent to the Apollonius Circle. Then (AP) is equal in length to (AB) or (AC) since an equilateral triangle’s vertices are at equal distances. 6. **Midpoint Approach**: - Let (M) be the midpoint of (BC). Note (AM) is perpendicular to (BC) and bisects it. 7. **Ratio Calculations**: - Bob rearranging (BP:PC) considering the point (T) (the center of Apollonius Circle): - Compute (AD): [ AD = AD = BD + CD = 3 + 5 = 8 ] - Suppose (P) lies on (overrightarrow{AD}), resulting in (AP = 1): - Using similarity of triangles (triangle DPT) and (triangle ADM) compute: [ TD = frac{AD^2}{BC} = frac{8^2}{BC} = 7 ] - Therefore: [ frac{BP}{PC} = sqrt{frac{BT}{TC}} = sqrt{frac{4}{12}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} ] 8. **Verification of the Product of Ratios**: - Applying the ratio property from (triangle DPT) and require (frac{BP}{PC} = x Rightarrow frac{Bp}{Pc}x = frac{3}{5}) - Consequently: [ x cdot y = frac{3}{5} Rightarrow boxed{frac{3sqrt{3}}{5}} ] # Conclusion: Therefore, the valid possible values of (frac{BP}{PC}) for points that Alice can choose such that Bob cannot find another point (Q) with the same ratio, are: [ boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, 1, frac{3sqrt{3}}{5}} ]"},{"prompt":"a certain school, the ratio of boys to girls is 5 to 13.

In other words, ( m ) is the count of intra-commission enmities. - Note that ( m ) is a non-negative integer. 5. **Effect of the Operation**: - When a deputy with at least two enemies in their current commission moves to the other commission: - We break at least two intra-commission enmities (since the deputy has at least two enemies in the original commission). - We create at most one new intra-commission enmity (since the deputy can have at most one enemy in the other commission). - Consequently, this operation decreases the value of ( m ) by at least one.

Generalize.","completion":": 1. **Initial Setup:** Let F be a planar figure that undergoes one parallel translation to a new position F^{l}. After a second parallel translation, the figure reaches a position F^{primeprime}. 2. **Understanding Parallel Translations:** Parallel translations involve shifting a geometric figure by moving every point of the figure by the same distance in a given direction. For simplicity, consider two parallel translations: one from F to F^l and the second from F^l to F^{primeprime}. 3. **First Parallel Translation:** Let mathbf{v_1} be the vector representing the first parallel translation from F to F^l. Thus, [ F^l = F + mathbf{v_1} ] 4. **Second Parallel Translation:** Let mathbf{v_2} be the vector representing the second parallel translation from F^l to F^{primeprime}. Thus, [ F^{primeprime} = F^l + mathbf{v_2} ] 5. **Substituting F^l from Step 3 into Step 4:** [ F^{primeprime} = (F + mathbf{v_1}) + mathbf{v_2} ] Simplifying, we get: [ F^{primeprime} = F + (mathbf{v_1} + mathbf{v_2}) ] 6. **Combined Translation Vector:** Let mathbf{v} be the combined vector of the two translations: [ mathbf{v} = mathbf{v_1} + mathbf{v_2} ] 7. **Single Translation from F to F^{primeprime}:** The figure F can be directly translated to F^{primeprime} using the single vector mathbf{v}. Therefore, [ F^{primeprime} = F + mathbf{v} ] 8. **Conclusion for General Case:** If n parallel translations take a figure F to a position F^n, then the combined effect of these translations can be replaced by a single translation vector mathbf{v} which is the sum of all individual translation vectors mathbf{v_1}, mathbf{v_2}, ldots, mathbf{v_n}. Thus, the conclusion is that any number n of parallel translations that move the figure F to F^n can be achieved by a single parallel translation: boxed{F^{primeprime} = F + mathbf{v_1} + mathbf{v_2}} Thus, F can be directly translated to F^{primeprime} by a single parallel translation, completing the proof."},{"prompt":"Given a > b and c in mathbb{R}, then ( ) A: frac{1}{a} < frac{1}{b} B: |a| > |b| C: a^3 > b^3 D: ac > bc","completion":"By utilizing the function f(x) = x^3, which is monotonically increasing over mathbb{R}, we can determine that option C is correct.

Therefore, without the condition that c>0, we cannot guarantee the correctness of this statement. - Option B: Consider the specific case where a=0 and b=-1. Here, a>b is true, but a^2 = 0^2 = 0 is not greater than b^2 = (-1)^2 = 1, thus proving that the statement does not always hold. - Option C: For any real numbers a and b, if a>b, then it's invariably true that a^3 > b^3. This is because cubing maintains the inequality for both positive and negative values. - Option D: The statement a^2 > b^2 Rightarrow a>b is incorrect because we can find counterexamples. For instance, if a=-2 and b=0, then a^2 = (-2)^2 = 4 is indeed greater than b^2 = 0, but a=-2 is not greater than b=0.

The number of people contributing in each scenario is represented by the total amount collected divided by the contribution per person, which is then compared to the price of the sheep minus the shortage. For the first scenario, the equation is formed by considering that the total amount collected (when each person contributes 5 coins) plus the shortage (45 coins) should equal the price of the sheep. Similarly, for the second scenario, the total amount collected (with each person contributing 7 coins) plus the shortage (3 coins) equals the price of the sheep. These scenarios lead us to the equation: frac{x-45}{5}=frac{x-3}{7} This equation represents the relationship between the price of the sheep and the contributions made in each scenario, taking into account the shortages.

Richard knocked down 3 less than Patrick in the second round, so Richard's score for the second round is: 2R - 3 = 2(70 + x) - 3.

The area of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) * (height) In this case, the parallel sides are the vertical sides, and their lengths can be found by subtracting the y-coordinates of their endpoints. The height of the trapezoid is the horizontal distance between the parallel sides, which is the difference in the x-coordinates. Let's calculate the lengths of the parallel sides: For the side between (4, -3) and (4, 7), the length is |7 - (-3)| = 10. For the side between (12, 2) and (12, y4), the length is |y4 - 2|. The height of the trapezoid is the horizontal distance between the parallel sides, which is |12 - 4| = 8.

Since point (2,1) is inside circle C: x^2 + y^2 - 6x + 5 = 0 (which can be verified by plugging the coordinates into the circle equation), it follows that line l must intersect with circle C. boxed{text{Line l intersects with circle C.}} 2. The equation of circle C can be rewritten as (x-3)^2 + y^2 = 4 after completing the square in x. The center of the circle is at (3,0), and the radius is 2. Since AB = 2sqrt{2}, we know that the perpendicular distance from the circle's center to line l is sqrt{4 - 2} = sqrt{2} (using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle formed by the diameter, chord AB, and the radius perpendicular to AB). The distance from the center of the circle (3,0) to the line l can be found using the point-line distance formula: text{Distance} = frac{|3a + 0 - a - 2|}{sqrt{1 + a^2}} = frac{|2a - 2|}{sqrt{1 + a^2}}. Setting this equal to sqrt{2}, we get: frac{|2a - 2|}{sqrt{1 + a^2}} = sqrt{2}, which simplifies to: |2a - 2| = sqrt{2 + 2a^2}. Squaring both sides to remove the absolute value and the square root yields: (2a - 2)^2 = 2 + 2a^2. Expanding and simplifying gives: 4a^2 - 8a + 4 = 2 + 2a^2. Putting like terms on one side results in: 2a^2 - 8a + 2 = 0. Dividing through by 2 leads to: a^2 - 4a + 1 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for a, we get a = 1 or a = 1/3. However, since it is given that AB = 2sqrt{2}, and knowing the perpendicular bisector of chord AB passes through the center of the circle, there is only one possible line that satisfies all the conditions and intersects the circle in such a manner that AB = 2sqrt{2}. Therefore, we disregard the solution with a = 1/3.

With the reduced price P, the motorist can buy 250 / P = X + 5 gallons of petrol (5 gallons more than before). We can set up the equation: 250 / 5.56 = 250 / P - 5 Now we solve for P: 1. 250 / 5.56 + 5 = 250 / P 2. X + 5 = 250 / P Let's calculate X first: X = 250 / 5.56 X ≈ 44.96 (rounded to two decimal places) Now we substitute X back into the equation 2: 44.96 + 5 = 250 / P 49.96 ≈ 250 / P Now we solve for P: P = 250 / 49.96 P ≈ 5.00 (rounded to two decimal places) Now we have the reduced price P, which is approximately 5.00 per gallon. To find the percentage reduction, we use the formula: Percentage Reduction = [(Original Price - Reduced Price) / Original Price] * 100 Percentage Reduction = [(5.56 - 5.00) / 5.56] * 100 Percentage Reduction ≈ [0.56 / 5.56] * 100 Percentage Reduction ≈ 0.1007 * 100 Percentage Reduction ≈ 10.07% So the percentage reduction in the price of petrol is approximately boxed{10.07%} ."},{"prompt":"Samantha wanted to buy a refrigerator but pay in installments.

Then ( P_n(m) - 1 ) is divisible by ( m ). Even substituting ( m' = P_k(m) ): [ P_{n+k}(m) equiv 1 pmod{m} ] showing mutual coprimeness. 5. **Resulting Implication:** This shows that under successive applications of ( f ), the set ( {m, f(m), f(f(m)), ldots} ) are pairwise coprime for any natural number ( m > 1 ). Each pair ( (f^i(m), f^j(m)) ) for ( i neq j ) are coprime as ( f^j(m) - f^i(m) ) simplifies to terms divisible by ( m ) and 1. Conclusively, if any sequence of numbers is pairwise coprime, then one can form infinitely many primes from such sequences by setting: [ P_{n}(x), P_{n}(2), P_{n+1}(2), ldots ] which leads to the conclusion about infinity of primes, proving the main statement.

The vertex form of a parabola ( y = ax^2 ) has its vertex at the origin (0,0), and the focus is at ( (0, frac{1}{4a}) ), so here ( a = frac{1}{16} ) and the focus ( F ) is at ( (0, frac{4}{16}) = (0, frac{1}{4}) ). The directrix is symmetrically opposite to the focus relative to the vertex, hence at ( y = -frac{1}{4} ). After transforming: - Moving the vertex right by 4 units does not change the directrix equation. - Moving it downward by ( frac{1}{4} ) shifts the directrix also downward by ( frac{1}{4} ): [ y = -frac{1}{4} - frac{1}{4} = -frac{1}{2} ] Thus, the equation of the directrix of the parabola ( y = frac{1}{16} (x - 4)^2 - frac{1}{4} ) is ( boxed{y = -frac{1}{2}} )."},{"prompt":"When climbing from the first to the third floor, Petya covers 36 steps.

Consequently, the reciprocals ( frac{1}{w - z_1}, frac{1}{w - z_2}, dots, frac{1}{w - z_n} ) also lie in one half-plane. 6. However, the sum of vectors all lying in one half-plane cannot be zero because their directions are constrained, implying: [ frac{1}{w - z_1} + frac{1}{w - z_2} + cdots + frac{1}{w - z_n} neq 0 ] This contradicts our assumption that ( P'(w) = 0 ). Therefore, the assumption that ( w ) does not belong to the convex hull leads to a contradiction. Hence, ( w ) must lie within the convex hull of the roots ( z_1, z_2, dots, z_n ).

The total time spent on the diorama, which is the sum of the building and planning times, is 67 minutes. This gives us a second equation, b + p = 67. We can solve this system of equations step by step: First, substitute the expression for b from the first equation into the second equation: [3p - 5 + p = 67] Combine like terms (the p terms): [4p - 5 = 67] To isolate the p term, add 5 to both sides of the equation: [4p - 5 + 5 = 67 + 5] [4p = 72] Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for p: [4p / 4 = 72 / 4] [p = 18] Having found the planning time (p = 18 minutes), we can now find the building time b by substituting p back into the first equation: [b = 3p - 5] [b = 3(18) - 5] [b = 54 - 5] [b = 49] Therefore, Annie spent boxed{49} minutes building the diorama."},{"prompt":"the next five days, 5000 people will move to Texas.

We start by considering that there are at least four numbers and let ( a ) be the number with the smallest absolute value among these numbers. 2. Among the remaining numbers, at least two of them must have the same sign. Let us denote these numbers as ( b ) and ( c ). 3. Since ( b ) and ( c ) have the same sign, their product ( bc ) is non-negative. Specifically, ( bc = |bc| ). 4. Now, considering that ( a ) is the number with the smallest absolute value, we have ( |a| leq |b| ) and ( |a| leq |c| ), which implies ( a^2 leq b^2 ) and ( a^2 leq c^2 ). 5. Therefore, [ bc geq a^2 implies |bc| geq a^2. ] 6. This situation creates a contradiction because, under the assumption that ( bc geq a^2 ), the inequality does not align with the initial condition where ( a ) has the minimum absolute value and hence should theoretically satisfy ( bc < a^2 ) under some configurations. Thus, it follows logically that having four numbers will always lead to a contradiction with the initial condition. # Example: Next, we consider an example with three numbers satisfying the condition. Let these numbers be ( 1, 2, ) and ( -3 ). Notice: 1. The product ( 1 times (-3) = -3 ) and ( 2 times (-3) = -6 ). 2.

All subscripts are modulo 2000. **Case 1**: ( P_iP_j ) is not poddy. - Petya cuts the wires ( P_{i+500}P_{j+500}, P_{i+1000}P_{j+1000}, P_{i+1500}P_{j+1500} ).

Hence, ( P_{i+500}P_{j+500} ) is uncut, and similarly for the other two wires. - **Observation 2**: After Petya's move, there are either 0, 3, or 6 wires remaining in any pod. This is because the number of wires in a pod always decreases by 0 or 3 when Vasya moves and then Petya moves. - **Observation 3**: If there are 3 or 6 wires in a pod, then none of the vertices of the pod are dead. This is easily verified. 5. **Conclusion**: - Petya's strategy ensures that he cannot be the first one to make a vertex dead. Therefore, Petya has a winning strategy.

Who wins with optimal play? (The piece is always placed exactly in the center of each square.)","completion":"1. **Introduction and Base Case:** Consider a chessboard where a piece stands on a particular square. Two players take turns moving the piece, starting from the first player. On each move, beginning with the second move, the distance the piece is moved must be strictly greater than on the previous move. The player who cannot make a move loses. The piece is always placed exactly in the center of the square. We need to determine who wins with optimal play. Suppose the first player always moves the piece to a position on the board that is centrally symmetric to the current position of the piece. The first move can obviously be made this way. We will use induction to show that the first player can always move the piece in this manner, and after each move of the second player, the distance from the piece to the center ( O ) of the board increases. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that after some move of the first player, the piece is at point ( K ) and the distance from ( O ) to ( K ) is ( r ). Therefore, previously all points (centers of squares) visited by the piece lay within a circle of radius ( r ) centered at ( O ). By this move, the first player moved the piece to a distance ( 2r ). 3. **Inductive Step:** Next, the second player moves the piece to some point ( M ), where ( KM = 2R ) and ( 2R > 2r ). Therefore, the new distance from ( O ) to ( M ) can be written as: [ OM = OM - OK + KM - OK = 2R - r > R > r ] Therefore, at symmetric point ( M' ), the piece has not been placed yet, and the first player can move the piece there, thus moving it: [ OM' = 2OM > 2R ] Thus, by the inductive hypothesis, the first player can always make a move that maintains the centrally symmetric property. 4. **Conclusion:** This process will repeat itself until the game concludes since there are a finite number of potential distances from the piece to the center of the board. As the first player can always make a move, the second player will eventually be unable to make a move and will lose. Therefore, with optimal play, the winner is always the first player.

Since one kilogram of sugar costs 1.50, two kilograms will cost: 2 kg * 1.50/kg = 3.00 Now, we know that the total cost of two kilograms of sugar and some kilograms of salt is 5.50. If we subtract the cost of the sugar from the total cost, we can find the cost of the salt: 5.50 (total cost) - 3.00 (cost of sugar) = 2.50 (cost of salt) We don't know the price per kilogram of salt, but we can use the information from the second part of the question to find it.

If a_m < A_m for the smallest m where a_m neq A_m, then a_m = A_i + 2A_j + 4A_k with i, j, k < m, leading to a contradiction. Hence, such A_n neq a_n must be the same sequence. 6. **Ordering sums of distinct powers of 8**: For sums of distinct powers of 8, say C = c_0 + c_1 cdot 8 + c_2 cdot 8^2 + ldots and D = d_0 + d_1 cdot 8 + ldots, C < D if the binary sequence (c_0, c_1, ldots) is lesser in lexicographical order.

The original area of the towel is A = L * B. After bleaching, the length of the towel becomes 90% of L (since it lost 10% of its length), so the new length is 0.9L. Let's assume the breadth decreases by x%, so the new breadth is (1 - x/100) * B. The new area of the towel after bleaching is A' = (0.9L) * ((1 - x/100) * B).

This fencing is meant to enclose a rectangular garden, and the perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. Therefore, the sum of the length and width of the garden is half of the perimeter: [l + w = frac{142}{2} = 71.] Let's denote one side of the rectangle as x. Consequently, the other side would be 71 - x because the sum of both sides must equal 71. The area of the rectangle can be calculated by multiplying the lengths of its sides, which gives us: [A = x(71 - x) = 71x - x^2.] To find the maximum area, we can complete the square for the quadratic equation representing the area. The equation 71x - x^2 can be rewritten by completing the square: [-x^2 + 71x = -left(x^2 - 71x + left(frac{71}{2}right)^2 - left(frac{71}{2}right)^2right) = -left(x - frac{71}{2}right)^2 + left(frac{71}{2}right)^2.] Simplifying the constant term: [-left(x - frac{71}{2}right)^2 + frac{5041}{4}.] To maximize the area, we need to minimize the square term left(x - frac{71}{2}right)^2. The minimum value of this square term is 0, which occurs when x = frac{71}{2}. However, since x must be a natural number, we cannot directly use frac{71}{2}. Instead, we choose the closest integers to frac{71}{2}, which are 35 and 36.

The distance d from C to the line y=kx+3 can be found using the point-to-line distance formula: d = frac{|k cdot 4 - 1 cdot 3 + 3|}{sqrt{k^2+1^2}} = frac{|4k|}{sqrt{k^2+1}}. Next, we are given that the length of chord MN must be at least 2sqrt{3}. The length of a chord in a circle, given the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord (which is the distance d in this case), can be expressed as: |MN| = 2sqrt{radius^2 - d^2}, where the radius of the circle is 2. Squaring both sides of the inequality |MN| geqslant 2sqrt{3}, we have: 4(radius^2 - d^2) geqslant 12, which simplifies to: radius^2 - d^2 geqslant 3. Substituting in the expression for d derived earlier and the radius radius = 2, we obtain: 4 - (frac{|4k|}{sqrt{k^2+1}})^2 geqslant 3. This simplifies to: 4 - frac{16k^2}{k^2+1} geqslant 3, which leads to: 1 geqslant frac{16k^2}{k^2+1}.

We are given that: ((x θ 33) θ 17) - (99 θ (33 θ 17)) = 4 First, let's simplify the expression (33 θ 17).

Since 99 divided by 16 gives a quotient of 6 with a remainder of 3, we have: 99 θ 16 = 3 Now, our equation looks like this: ((x θ 33) θ 17) - 3 = 4 Adding 3 to both sides, we get: ((x θ 33) θ 17) = 7 Now, we need to find a value for x such that when x is divided by 33, the remainder, when divided by 17, gives us 7.

The widths of these strips are specified as follows: - The first (left) strip has a width of 19 cells. - The second strip has a width of 70 cells. - The third (right) strip has a width which will naturally be (100 - 19 - 70 = 11) cells. 1. **First Row Configuration:** The first row consists of consecutive numbers from 1 to 100. These numbers are arranged sequentially across the width of 100 cells. 2. **Second Row Configuration:** The second row is formed by taking numbers from the third strip first, then from the second strip, and finally from the first strip. The arrangement of these numbers is done without changing their order: - Numbers from the third strip (last 11 numbers of the row): 90 to 100. - Then numbers from the second strip (middle 70 numbers of the row): 20 to 89. - Finally, numbers from the first strip (first 19 numbers of the row): 1 to 19. 3. **Subsequent Rows Configuration:** This same process is iteratively applied to form each subsequent row. We repeatedly cycle through the strips in the same order as above, ensuring that numbers from each strip appear in the correct places without altering the order. 4. **Proving that each column contains all numbers from 1 to 100:** This iterative transcription process ensures that the columns ultimately blend and mix the numbers thoroughly. To prove this, consider the modular arithmetic involved in arranging the numbers: - Each number (n) in the current row is from a uniformly distributed set across the strips in its previous row, and this set shifts in a periodic manner due to the fixed order of strip processing. By iterating the above process (100) times (filling all rows in the (100 times 100) grid), every number from 1 to 100 will be encountered exactly once in each column. This is ensured by the period of the distribution cycle: - There are 100 possible final positions in each column (one per row), and this structure enforces that all integers from 1 to 100 spread through these positions steadily due to the consistent cycling of segments. 5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, using this construction, it’s clear that: [ boxed{text{In each column, all numbers from 1 to 100 will appear exactly once.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Two friends, Amy and Lily, are playing tictactoe.

The union of these spheres defines the geometric locus (H). - (H) is obtained by rotating about the line through (B') and (C'). 7. **Intersections with Planes:** - If we consider the plane that passes through (A) and the line (BC), this plane will intersect the spheres in circles. Points on these circles are parts of the locus. 8. **Critical Points Analysis:** - The points at the boundaries, i.e., (B') and (C'), correspond to circles with maximum diameters as per Thales' theorem. 9. **Visualizing the Full Locus:** - By imaging the rotation of the entire configuration around (B'C') in 3D, you construct all possible locations for the vertex (D) of the right angle (ADE). 10. **Final Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:** - The complete locus excludes the interior common regions of intersecting spheres, as these do not contribute to the formation of a right angle. **Conclusion:** The locus of point (D) is the set of all points ((x,y,z)) that lie on the surfaces of the spheres formed by taking points on (B'C') as centers and radii being half the length of the segments intersecting (A) and any point on (BC). This locus consists of two spherical shells, excluding any common interior parts they might share.

The conversion factor between km/hr and m/s is: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s So, to convert 200 km/hr to m/s: 200 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = (200 * 1000) / 3600 m/s 200,000 / 3600 m/s ≈ 55.56 m/s Now that we have the speed in m/s, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the electric pole. Since the train only needs to cover its own length to completely pass the pole, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance to be covered is the length of the train, which is 500 m, and the speed is 55.56 m/s.

We need to show that (b+1) is a power of 2. To proceed, we will leverage the properties of Zsigmondy's theorem, which states that for any integers ( a > 1 ) and ( n > 1 ) with the exception of a few specific cases, ( a^n - 1 ) has a prime factor that does not divide ( a^k - 1 ) for any ( k < n ). The specific cases to be aware of are: 1. ( a = 2 ) and ( n = 6 ), because ( 2^6 - 1 = 63 ), which factors into ( 3 cdot 3^2 cdot 7 ). 2. ( a + 1 ) is a power of 2, which may produce similar factors up to certain limits. Here's a step-by-step analysis: 1. **Applying the Zsigmondy's theorem**: Given any ( b neq 1 ) and ( m neq n ), by Zsigmondy's theorem, there exists a prime factor of ( b^m - 1 ) that does not divide ( b^k - 1 ) for any ( k < m ). Similarly, there exists a prime factor of ( b^n - 1 ) that does not divide ( b^k - 1 ) for any ( k < n ). If both ( b^m - 1 ) and ( b^n - 1 ) have the same prime factors, we consider the few exceptions. 2. **Examining the exceptional cases**: The primary exception involves ( b + 1 ) being a power of 2. For example: - When ( b = 2^k - 1 ), then ( b+1 = 2^k ) indeed is a power of 2. This matches our hypothesis that ( b+1 ) should be a power of 2. 3. **Conclusion from Zsigmondy's theorem and exceptional cases**: Given the factors ( b + 1 ) being invariant across different values of ( m, n ), and recognizing that Zsigmondy's exceptions uniquely cover at ( b ) values where ( b+1 ) must be a power of 2, we conclude that ( b+1 ) indeed must be a power of 2. Thus, the condition that ( b^m - 1 ) and ( b^n - 1 ) have the same prime factors enforces ( b+1 ) to always be a power of 2.

This move changes the within-group acquaintance counts: - ( A )'s acquaintance pairs in ( G_1 ) will be removed. - At most one new acquaintance pair will be created within ( G_2 ). Let's denote the students in ( G_1 ) that ( A ) knows as ( B ) and ( C ). Therefore, initially, we have at least two acquaintance pairs in ( G_1 ) involving ( A ): ((A,B)) and ((A,C)). 6. **Result of Moving ( A ):** By moving ( A ) to ( G_2 ), we effectively: - Remove acquaintance pairs ((A,B)) and ((A,C)) from ( G_1 ), - Introduce at most one acquaintance pair within ( G_2 ). The net effect is a decrease in the number of within-group acquaintance pairs (from at least 2 to at most 1). 7. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** This result contradicts our initial assumption that ( M ) is minimized in the chosen partition. Thus, there cannot exist a student in the minimized partition who knows more than one person within their own group. Conclusion: By minimality and the contradiction derived, the assumption fails, hence we can always partition the students into two groups such that each student knows at most one person within their group.

Furthermore, the problem states that the product of the ages of the father and his three sons equals the sum of 1000 times the cube of the sons' ages and 10 times the square of the sons' ages: [ F cdot a cdot b cdot c = 3^3 cdot 1000 + 3^2 cdot 10 ] 4. First, we compute the values on the right-hand side: [ 3^3 cdot 1000 + 3^2 cdot 10 = 27 cdot 1000 + 9 cdot 10 = 27000 + 90 = 27090 ] 5.

The factorization of 27090 is: [ 27090 = 2 cdot 3^2 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdot 43 ] 7. Since ( a = b + c ), we can test reasonable values that satisfy the factorization and the sum constraint.

We have determined: - angle C = 100^circ - angle BAK = angle YKD = 100^circ So, triangles DYC and DYK have two angles equal and one common side (DY). 4. **Triangles Congruency**: By the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) Congruence Theorem, triangles DYC and DYK are congruent: [ triangle DYC cong triangle DYK ] From this congruence, we have: - YK = YC = AX (since AX = CY by given conditions). 5. **Parallel Line Argument**: Therefore, quadrilateral AXYK is a parallelogram (as opposite sides AX = YK and XY = AK are equal and parallel). 6. **Angle Calculation**: In parallelogram AXYK, the opposite angles are equal: [ angle AXY = angle AKY ] Given A and K are points on AD and YK parallel AB, which implies: - angle BAC = 100^circ - angle AXK, and hence angle AKY = 80^circ since angle BAD = 100^circ Therefore, we conclude: [ angle AXY = 80^circ ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{80^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"One mole of an ideal gas undergoes a cyclic process described in the ((T, V)) variables by the equation left(frac{V}{V_{0}} aright)^{2} + left(frac{T}{T_{0}} bright)^{2} = c^{2} where ( V_{0}, T_{0}, a, b, c ) are certain constants, with ( c^{2} < a^{2} + b^{2} ).

The probability of serving until the third attempt is P(X = 3) = (1-p)^2, as they must fail twice.

Let us correct this process: The expected number of serves is: E[X] = 1 cdot P(X = 1) + 2 cdot P(X = 2) + 3 cdot P(X = 3) = 1 cdot p + 2 cdot p(1-p) + 3 cdot (1-p)^2.

Next, find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation p^2 - 4p + 1.25 = 0. However, a simpler approach is to rewrite the inequality as: p^2 - 4p + 2 = 0.25, or (p-2)^2 = 0.25. From this, the roots are: p - 2 = pm 0.5, which gives us p = 1.5 or p = 2.5. Since the probability cannot exceed 1, we consider only p = 1.5. Hence, we have two intervals p < 1.5 or p > 2.5. However, the latter is impossible since p is a probability and cannot exceed 1.

Find the number of times the bikers passed each other moving in opposite directions.","completion":"We are given a scenario where two bikers, Bill and Sal, simultaneously set off from one end of a straight road. Each biker continues biking until he reaches one end of the road, at which point he turns around instantaneously. When they meet at the opposite end from where they started, Bill has traveled the length (ell) of the road eleven times and Sal seven times. Our task is to find the number of times the bikers pass each other moving in opposite directions. Let's break down the problem step-by-step. 1. **Understanding the Problem:** - Bill has traveled the road 11 times in total. - Sal has traveled the road 7 times in total. - Each full trip from one end of the road to the other and back counts as 2 times the length of the road. - Therefore, both start at one end and travel to the opposite end multiple times. 2. **Turns and Passes:** - Define a \\"pass\\" (mathrm{P}) as a moment when Bill and Sal pass each other moving in opposite directions. - Define a \\"turn\\" (mathrm{T}) as a moment when a biker reaches an end of the road and turns around. - The sequence of states they can be in are: - **State A**: Both bikers moving in the same direction. - **State B**: Bikers moving toward each other. - **State C**: Bikers moving away from each other. 3. **State Transitions:** - From state **A**: One biker reaches an end and turns around, entering state **B**. - From state **B**: They pass each other, entering state **C**. - From state **C**: One biker reaches an end and turns around, entering state **A**. 4. **Counting Turns and Passes:** - Bill travels the length of the road 11 times, hence he makes (11 - 1 = 10) turns. - Sal travels the length of the road 7 times, hence he makes (7 - 1 = 6) turns. - Total number of turns is (10 + 6 = 16). 5. **Sequence Analysis:** - Since we start at state **A** and the sequence of states is periodic: ABCABC... ending in state A. - The sequence of turns and passes when they meet at state changes is T - P - T - T - P ..., - Given (k) passes, there will be (k) intervening turns plus the initial turn corresponding to the first turn. - The cycle “ABC” finishes one cycle repeat: - Each cycle involves 2 turns and 1 pass. - If (n) is the number of cycles, then: [ 2n + 1 = 16 ] - Solve for (n): [ 2n = 15 implies n = 7.5 ] - Each whole cycle contains one ( mathrm{P} ), hence total passes = (7 + 1) = (8). In conclusion, the number of times the bikers passed each other moving in opposite directions is [ boxed{8} ]"},{"prompt":"Given four points on a plane that do not lie on a single line, prove that there exists a nonacute triangle with its vertices at these points.","completion":": Let us examine various configurations of the four given points on the plane to demonstrate the existence of a non-acute triangle formed by these points. 1. If the four points are vertices of a convex quadrilateral, then the sum of the interior angles is (360^circ). Consider a convex quadrilateral (ABCD). The sum of the interior angles of (ABCD) can be expressed as: [ angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 360^circ ] Since none of the angles can individually exceed (180^circ), it follows that at least one of these angles must be non-acute (i.e., (geq 90^circ)). Let us assume (angle D) is non-acute. Form a triangle using vertex (D) and its two adjacent vertices: [ triangle ABD quad text{or} quad triangle BCD ] Since (angle D) is non-acute, either (triangle ABD) or (triangle BCD) is non-acute.

Since point (A) is inside (triangle BCD), the angles formed at (A) with the vertices (B, C, D) can be added up: [ angle BAC + angle CAD + angle DAB = 360^circ ] Again, since the sum must be (360^circ), at least one of (angle BAC), (angle CAD), or (angle DAB) must be (geq 120^circ). Suppose (angle CAD geq 120^circ), form the triangle: [ triangle CAD ] This triangle is non-acute because it contains (angle CAD) which is (geq 120^circ).

Let us assume (angle DBA geq 90^circ). Form the triangle: [ triangle DBA quad text{or} quad triangle DBC ] Since (angle DBA) is (geq 90^circ), (triangle DBA) is non-acute.

If A can complete the work in 12 days, then in one day, A can complete 1/12 of the work. If B can complete the work in 18 days, then in one day, B can complete 1/18 of the work. Working together, in one day, A and B can complete: (1/12) + (1/18) of the work. To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 36 in this case: (3/36) + (2/36) = (5/36) of the work in one day. So, together they can complete the work in: 1 / (5/36) = 36/5 = 7.2 days. Now, we need to find the ratio of the work done by A to the work done by B. Since A can complete the work in 12 days and B in 18 days, the ratio of their work per day is: A's work per day : B's work per day = 1/12 : 1/18 To simplify this ratio, we can multiply both sides by the least common multiple of 12 and 18, which is 36: (36/12) : (36/18) = 3 : 2 This means that for every 3 parts of the work A does, B does 2 parts. The total parts of work done by A and B together is 3 + 2 = 5 parts. Now, we can find A's share of the payment by dividing A's part of the work by the total parts and then multiplying by the total payment: A's share = (A's parts / Total parts) * Total payment A's share = (3 / 5) * 149.25 A's share = 0.6 * 149.25 A's share = 89.55 So, A's share of the payment is Rs. boxed{89.55} ."},{"prompt":"A 13meter ladder is leaning against a vertical wall.

A 30% raise on 20 is calculated as follows: 30% of 20 = 0.30 * 20 = 6 So, his new hourly wage is: 20 + 6 = 26 Now, let's find out how many days he worked in the 30-day month. Since he works every other day, he works half of the days in the month. Number of days worked = 30 days / 2 = 15 days Now we know that he made 4680 in 15 days. To find out how many hours he worked in total, we divide the total amount he made by his hourly wage. Total hours worked = Total amount made / Hourly wage Total hours worked = 4680 / 26 Now, let's calculate the total hours worked: Total hours worked = 4680 / 26 ≈ 180 hours Since these hours were worked over 15 days, we can find out how many hours he worked each day by dividing the total hours by the number of days worked. Hours worked every other day = Total hours worked / Number of days worked Hours worked every other day = 180 hours / 15 days Now, let's calculate the hours worked every other day: Hours worked every other day = 180 hours / 15 days = 12 hours So, John works boxed{12} hours every other day."},{"prompt":"a bag, there are 32 identically shaped and sized chess pieces, of which 16 are red and 16 are green.

The total budget for the motorist, including the discounted oil change, is 250. We know that 200 is spent on petrol, so the remaining amount is for the oil change: [ 250 - 200 = 50 ] This 50 is the discounted cost of the oil change, which is 0.8x dollars. So we have: [ 0.8x = 50 ] Solving for x: [ x = frac{50}{0.8} ] [ x = frac{500}{8} ] [ x = 62.5 ] So the original cost of the oil change was 62.5, and the discounted cost of the oil change was 50.

Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price (at Rs. 153) Loss = 180 - 153 Loss = 27 Now, let's find the loss percentage: Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) * 100 Loss Percentage = (27 / 180) * 100 Loss Percentage = 0.15 * 100 Loss Percentage = 15% So, the percentage loss if the article is sold for Rs. 153 is boxed{15%} ."},{"prompt":"f frac{p}{q} = frac{5}{6} and frac{s}{u} = frac{7}{15}, find the value of frac{5ps 3qu}{6qu 5ps}. textbf{(A)} frac{19}{73} qquad textbf{(B)} frac{95}{365} qquad textbf{(C)} frac{11}{25} qquad textbf{(D)} frac{19}{73}","completion":"1. **Start by expressing p and q in terms of their ratio:** [ frac{p}{q} = frac{5}{6} implies 6p = 5q implies p = frac{5q}{6} ] 2. **Express s and u in terms of their ratio:** [ frac{s}{u} = frac{7}{15} implies 15s = 7u implies s = frac{7u}{15} ] 3. **Substitute p = frac{5q}{6} and s = frac{7u}{15} into the expression frac{5ps - 3qu}{6qu - 5ps}:** [ 5ps - 3qu = 5left(frac{5q}{6}right)left(frac{7u}{15}right) - 3qu = frac{175qu}{90} - 3qu = quleft(frac{175}{90} - 3right) ] Simplifying further: [ frac{175qu}{90} - 3qu = quleft(frac{175 - 270}{90}right) = quleft(frac{-95}{90}right) = frac{-95qu}{90} ] 4. **Substitute into 6qu - 5ps:** [ 6qu - 5ps = 6qu - 5left(frac{5q}{6}right)left(frac{7u}{15}right) = 6qu - frac{175qu}{90} ] Simplifying further: [ 6qu - frac{175qu}{90} = quleft(6 - frac{175}{90}right) = quleft(frac{540 - 175}{90}right) = quleft(frac{365}{90}right) = frac{365qu}{90} ] 5. **Combine these results into the original expression:** [ frac{5ps - 3qu}{6qu - 5ps} = frac{frac{-95qu}{90}}{frac{365qu}{90}} = frac{-95}{365} = -frac{95}{365} ] Factorize to simplify: [ -frac{95}{365} = -frac{5 times 19}{5 times 73} = -frac{19}{73} ] 6. **Conclude with the final answer:** [ -frac{19{73}} ] The final answer is **boxed{textbf{(A)} -frac{19}{73}}**"},{"prompt":"Let {a_{n}} be an arithmetic sequence with the sum of the first n terms denoted as S_{n}.

We seek the time at which their distance is minimized and the minimum distance itself. **Step-by-Step Solution:** **Step 1:** Determine the motion coordinates. 1. For the object projected at an angle alpha, we use the known physics equations for projectile motion. The coordinates after time t are given by: [ x_1 = c t cos alpha, quad y_1 = c t sin alpha - frac{g}{2} t^2 ] 2.

Since (d^2(t)) is a quadratic function in (t), we take the derivative and set it to zero to find the critical points: [ d^2(t) = 2 c^2 t^2 (1 - sin alpha) - 2 a c t cos alpha + a^2 ] Differentiate with respect to (t): [ frac{d}{dt} d^2 = 4 c^2 t (1 - sin alpha) - 2 a c cos alpha ] Set the derivative to zero: [ 4 c^2 t (1 - sin alpha) - 2 a c cos alpha = 0 ] Solve for (t): [ 4 c^2 t (1 - sin alpha) = 2 a c cos alpha 2 c t (1 - sin alpha) = a cos alpha t = frac{a cos alpha}{2 c (1 - sin alpha)} ] **Step 4:** Evaluate the minimal distance (d_{min}).

Since the vertices are colored with three different colors, the triangle itself satisfies the condition. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that the statement holds for any convex polygon with ( n ) sides. We need to prove that it holds for a convex polygon with ( n+1 ) sides. - Consider a convex polygon with ( n+1 ) vertices. Since each color occurs at least once and no two adjacent vertices have the same color, there must exist three consecutive vertices of different colors. Suppose these vertices are ( v_1, v_2, v_3 ) and they are colored ( A, B, C ) respectively. - Draw the diagonal ( v_1v_3 ). This diagonal divides the polygon into two smaller polygons: one with ( n ) vertices (excluding ( v_2 )) and one triangle ( v_1v_2v_3 ). 3. **Induction Hypothesis Application:** - By the induction hypothesis, the ( n )-sided polygon (excluding ( v_2 )) can be divided into triangles such that each triangle has vertices of all three colors. Since ( v_1 ) and ( v_3 ) are of different colors, the induction hypothesis can be applied to the ( n )-sided polygon. 4. **Special Case Handling:** - The only potential issue arises if ( v_2 ) is the only vertex of color ( B ). In this case, the remaining ( n )-sided polygon would not have any vertex of color ( B ), and the induction hypothesis would not directly apply. - However, this situation can only occur if the remaining polygon is a ( 2k )-gon with vertices alternating in colors ( A ) and ( C ). Label the vertices ( v_1, v_3, v_4, ldots, v_{2k} ) with colors alternating between ( A ) and ( C ). 5. **Constructing the Triangulation:** - Draw the diagonals ( v_1v_3, v_1v_5, v_1v_7, ldots, v_1v_{2k-1} ) and ( v_3v_5, v_5v_7, ldots, v_{2k-3}v_{2k-1} ). - These diagonals divide the polygon into triangles, each of which includes vertices of all three colors ( A, B, C ).

The discount on the toy is 20% of 90 cents, which is: 20/100 * 90 cents = 18 cents discount. 6. The discounted price of the toy is: 90 cents - 18 cents = 72 cents. 7. She pays for the toy with the 140 cents she has. So, 140 cents - 72 cents = 68 cents remaining. 8. The cashier gives her change in dollars and cents: 1 dollar and 10 cents. 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, so the change is: 100 cents + 10 cents = 110 cents. 9.

Substitute the given expression for sin(A - B): [ frac{a}{a+b} sin A cos B - frac{b}{a+b} sin B cos A = sin A cos B - sin B cos A ] 3.

Since we have 4 moles of NH3 from step 2, we can produce 2 moles of Na2O (since we have 2 moles of NaOH available). 6) Na2O (aq) + CO2 (g) → Na2CO3 (s) From this reaction, 1 mole of Na2O produces 1 mole of Na2CO3. So, 2 moles of Na2O will produce 2 moles of Na2CO3. 7) Na2CO3 (aq) + 2 HNO3 (aq) → 2 NaNO3 (s) + H2O (l) + CO2 (g) From this reaction, 1 mole of Na2CO3 produces 2 moles of NaNO3. So, 2 moles of Na2CO3 will produce 4 moles of NaNO3. Now, we have the theoretical yield in moles, which is 4 moles of NaNO3. To convert this to grams, we need the molar mass of NaNO3, which is approximately 85 g/mol. Theoretical yield in grams = 4 moles * 85 g/mol = 340 grams However, we need to account for the overall percent yield, which is 85%.

For n = 1, the situation is simple and consists trivially of the sectors labeled '1' and '2'. These clearly satisfy both conditions: a) every two numbers are distinct, and b) every two adjacent numbers differ in exactly one digit. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for some n = k, we have successfully placed 2^k numbers, each consisting of k digits (either '1' or '2') in such a way that conditions a) and b) are satisfied. 3. **Inductive Step:** To move to n = k+1, we need to appropriately place 2^{k+1} numbers, each consisting of k+1 digits, in 2^{k+1} sectors. We will proceed as follows: - For each existing number in the k sectors, let's split each sector into two new sectors. - Append '1' to one set of the numbers and '2' to the corresponding other set. 4. **Example for k=2:** - Suppose for k=2, we have numbers '11', '12', '21', '22'. - To ensure the validity for k+1=3, convert these numbers as follows: - From '11', form '111' and '112'. - From '12', form '121' and '122'. - From '21', form '211' and '212'. - From '22', form '221' and '222'. Now, we have eight new numbers: - 111, 112, 121, 122, 211, 212, 221, 222 5. **Verification:** - We need to check if these new numbers satisfy the conditions of the problem. - Condition a) that any two numbers are different is obviously satisfied as discussed by combining 2^k unique digits with an additional 1 or 2. - Condition b) that any two consecutive sectors' numbers differ by exactly one digit: Due to the construction method adopted, every two consecutive numbers differ only by the last appended digit (1 or 2). For example, 112 and 122 differ only in the second position, 122 and 121 differ only in the third position and so on. 6. **Generalization:** This process can be generalized to any n. When n increases from k to k+1, the resulting 2^{k+1} numbers, following the construction explained above, will always satisfy: - Condition a) by being unique combinations. - Condition b) by invariantly differing in exactly one digit across adjacent sectors. Conclusion: By inductive proof, this validates the statement for n = 8 as well, ensuring the problem's conditions are met for the circle divided into 256 sectors. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"On a plane, there are three sets of points ( M, N, P ): ( M = {(x, y) mid |x| + |y| < 1} ) ( N = left{(x, y) leftlvert sqrt{left(x frac{1}{2}right)^2 + left(y + frac{1}{2}right)^2} + sqrt{left(x + frac{1}{2}right)^2 + left(y frac{1}{2}right)^2} < 2sqrt{2} right.right} ) ( P = {(x, y) mid |x + y| < 1, |x| < 1, |y| < 1} ) Which of the following is true?

Since ( 1000 equiv 1 pmod{3} ), we have: [ 1000a_n + 111 equiv a_n + 111 pmod{3} ] [ equiv k times 3n + 111 pmod{3} ] Note that 111 itself is 0 modulo 3 (since it is divisible by 3): [ k times 3n + 0 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] This implies: [ a_{n+1} equiv 0 pmod{3(n+1)} ] Thus ( a_{n+1} ) is divisible by ( 3(n+1) ). 7. **Conclusion:** By induction, since we have shown ( a_{n+1} ) is divisible by ( 3(n+1) ), starting with our base case ( a_1 ), it follows that for every positive integer n, there exists ( a_n ) that meets the criteria. Therefore, there are infinitely many integers that have no zeros and are divisible by the sum of their digits.

The map ell mapsto ell^* is a homography, meaning it is a projective transformation that maps lines to lines. Since ell neq ell^* for any position of D, the intersection points ell cap ell^* trace out a conic section. This conic passes through the points X, Y, E, E^*, and the points at infinity infty_{XZ} and infty_{YZ}, where Delta XYZ is the medial triangle of Delta ABC. 3. **Nature of the Conic:** The conic section described is a hyperbola because it passes through two points at infinity. Specifically, it passes through B, C, infty_{AB}, and infty_{AC}. 4. **Hyperbola and Medial Triangle:** We need to show that any point on this hyperbola cannot lie inside the medial triangle Delta XYZ. The medial triangle Delta XYZ is formed by the midpoints of the sides of Delta ABC. 5. **Parallel Projection:** To simplify the problem, we can use a parallel projection to transform Delta ABC into an equilateral triangle. This transformation preserves the properties of the conic section and the relative positions of points. 6. **Equilateral Triangle Case:** In the case of an equilateral triangle, the hyperbola passing through B, C, infty_{AB}, and infty_{AC} will have its branches outside the triangle. This is because the hyperbola's asymptotes will be parallel to the sides of the equilateral triangle, ensuring that the hyperbola does not intersect the interior of the medial triangle. 7. **Conclusion:** Since the hyperbola does not intersect the interior of the medial triangle in the equilateral case, and the parallel projection preserves this property, we conclude that the hyperbola cannot intersect the interior of the medial triangle in the general case.

Let the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides ( BC ), ( CA ), and ( AB ) be ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ) respectively. ![Triangle with Incircle](https://i.imgur.com/c9B1ZME.jpg) 3. **Lengths of Tangents from a Common Point**: Recall that the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length. Thus, we have: [ AE = AF = s - a ] [ BD = BF = s - b ] [ CD = CE = s - c ] where ( s = frac{a + b + c}{2} ) is the semi-perimeter of ( triangle ABC ). 4. **Distance Calculation**: The distance from vertex ( A ) to the point ( F ) on ( AB ) and to the point ( E ) on ( AC ) can be represented as follows: [ AE = AF = s - a ] 5. **Equating for the Given Expression**: Substitute the expression for ( s ): [ s = frac{a + b + c}{2} ] where ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are the lengths of sides opposite vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) respectively: [ s - a = frac{(a + b + c)}{2} - a = frac{a + b + c - 2a}{2} = frac{b + c - a}{2} ] Hence, the distance from vertex ( A ) to the points of tangency on ( AB ) and ( AC ) is indeed: [ AE = AF = frac{b + c - a}{2} ] which confirms the given expression. **Conclusion**: The proof is verified, the distance from vertex ( A ) to the points of tangency of sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) with the incircle is indeed: [ boxed{frac{AB + AC - BC}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Find all positive integers n, n>1 for wich holds : If a_1, a_2 ,dots ,a_k are all numbers less than n and relatively prime to n , and holds a_1<a_2<dots <a_k , then none of sums a_i+a_{i+1} for i=1,2,3,dots k1 are divisible by 3 .","completion":"1. **Initial Considerations**: We need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that for all numbers ( a_1, a_2, dots, a_k ) less than ( n ) and relatively prime to ( n ), with ( a_1 < a_2 < dots < a_k ), none of the sums ( a_i + a_{i+1} ) for ( i = 1, 2, dots, k-1 ) are divisible by 3. 2. **Case ( n = 2 )**: Clearly, ( n = 2 ) is a solution because the only number less than 2 and relatively prime to 2 is 1. There are no pairs ( (a_i, a_{i+1}) ) to consider, so the condition is trivially satisfied. 3. **Case ( n geq 3 )**: For ( n geq 3 ), the number of integers less than ( n ) and relatively prime to ( n ) is given by Euler's totient function ( phi(n) ). For ( n geq 3 ), ( phi(n) ) is even. 4. **Odd ( n )**: If ( n ) were odd, then ( a_2 = 2 ) (since 2 is relatively prime to any odd number). This would imply ( a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 2 = 3 ), which is divisible by 3. This is a contradiction. Hence, ( n ) must be even. 5. **Even ( n )**: For any ( x ) coprime to ( n ), ( n - x ) is also coprime to ( n ). Therefore, both ( x ) and ( n - x ) are in the set ( {a_i} ). Since ( phi(n) ) is even, we can pair the elements such that ( a_i + a_{k+1-i} = n ). 6. **Divisibility by 3**: If ( n ) is divisible by 3, then ( n = 3m ) for some integer ( m ). This would imply that ( a_i + a_{i+1} ) could be ( 3m ), which is divisible by 3. Hence, ( n ) cannot be divisible by 3. 7. **Modulo 3 Analysis**: We need ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ) or ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ). If ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then ( a_k + a_{k-1} = (n-1) + (n-3) equiv 0 pmod{3} ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ). 8. **Checking Small Values**: We check small values of ( n ) that satisfy ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ) and are even: - ( n = 4 ): The numbers less than 4 and relatively prime to 4 are 1 and 3.

Let's explore why this works. - If ( a ) and ( b ) are multiples of 3, then ( a equiv 0 pmod{3} ) and ( b equiv 0 pmod{3} ). - The difference ( b - a ) would also be a multiple of 3. Now, the allowed differences ( {1, 4, 5} ) are not multiples of 3: - 1 is not divisible by 3. - 4 is not divisible by 3. - 5 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, choosing all multiples of 3 ensures that the differences between any two chosen numbers will never be ( {1, 4, 5} ). 3. **Counting Multiples of 3**: Next, we need to count the number of multiples of 3 from 1 to 3000. - The smallest multiple of 3 in this range is 3. - The largest multiple of 3 in this range is 3000. - Therefore, the multiples of 3 form an arithmetic sequence starting at 3 and ending at 3000 with a common difference of 3. Formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: [ a_n = 3 + (n-1) cdot 3 = 3n ] Setting ( 3n = 3000 ): [ n = frac{3000}{3} = 1000 ] Hence, there are 1000 multiples of 3 from 1 to 3000. 4. **Verification**: - Consider any two multiples of 3, say ( 3k ) and ( 3m ). - Their difference is ( 3m - 3k = 3(m - k) ), which is a multiple of 3 and cannot be ( {1, 4, 5} ).

(2) If A and B together pay a total fare of 8 yuan, how many possible scenarios are there for A to get off the subway before B?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Given that A and B together pay a total fare of 6 yuan, we analyze the possible scenarios based on the fare table: - One passenger takes no more than 4 stations, which costs 2 yuan. - The other passenger takes more than 4 stations but no more than 9 stations, which costs 4 yuan. To find the total number of scenarios: 1. The number of ways for one passenger to choose a fare of 2 yuan is C_4^1 = 4, since there are 4 stations within this fare range. 2. The number of ways for the other passenger to choose a fare of 4 yuan is C_5^1 = 5, since there are 5 stations within this fare range (5 to 9). 3. Since there are two passengers, we need to consider the arrangements of these choices, which is A_2^2 = 2! = 2. Combining these, the total number of scenarios is calculated as: C_4^1 times C_5^1 times A_2^2 = 4 times 5 times 2 = 40 Therefore, there are boxed{40} possible scenarios for A and B to get off the subway. Part 2: Given that A and B together pay a total fare of 8 yuan, we consider scenarios where A gets off before B. There are two types of scenarios: **Type 1:** - A takes no more than 4 stations (2 yuan). - B takes more than 9 stations but no more than 15 stations (6 yuan). The number of scenarios for Type 1 is: C_4^1 times C_6^1 = 4 times 6 = 24 **Type 2:** - Both A and B take more than 4 stations but no more than 9 stations (4 yuan each). For A to get off before B, we consider the stations from the fifth to the ninth: 1. If A gets off at P_5, B has C_4^1 = 4 options. 2. If A gets off at P_6, B has C_3^1 = 3 options. 3. If A gets off at P_7, B has C_2^1 = 2 options. 4. If A gets off at P_8, B has only 1 option. Adding these scenarios for Type 2: C_4^1 + C_3^1 + C_2^1 + 1 = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 Combining both types, the total number of scenarios where A gets off before B is: 24 + 10 = 34 Therefore, there are boxed{34} scenarios where A gets off before B."},{"prompt":"Let the roots of the functions f(x) = 10^x + x 7 and g(x) = log x + x 7 be x_1 and x_2 respectively.

Therefore, g(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (0, ln 2) and monotonically increasing in [ln 2, +infty).

Pawns can capture opposing pawns by moving diagonally: - A white pawn can move to the cells diagonally up-right or up-left. - A black pawn can move to the cells diagonally down-left or down-right. 2. Observe the color of the squares: - A pawn that starts on a black square will always move to another black square. - Similarly, a pawn that starts on a white square will always move to another white square. 3. Since the moves are restricted to diagonal movements: - A white pawn will always remain on the white squares. - A black pawn will always remain on the black squares. 4. Analyze possible outcomes: - On black squares: Every time a black pawn captures another pawn, it moves to another black square, hence there will always be at least one black pawn remaining on the black squares. - On white squares: Similarly, there will always be at least one white pawn remaining on the white squares after every capture. 5. Minimum number of remaining pawns: - Therefore, there will always be at least one black pawn on the black squares and at least one white pawn on the white squares, making it a total of at least two pawns remaining on the chessboard. 6.

The function is odd, which implies that f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}, where f(x) = x^a. Let's breakdown the solution process into steps: - **Condition for the domain mathbb{R}**: Usually, when a is a positive integer, x^a is defined for all x. However, for non-integer a, such as fractions, we must be careful as fractional powers of negative numbers may not be defined within the real numbers. For example, if a=frac{1}{2}, x^a would represent a square root, which is not definable for negative x within mathbb{R}. Therefore, to make the domain mathbb{R}, a must be an integer. - **Condition for an odd function**: For y = x^a to be odd, we need (-x)^a = -x^a for all x in mathbb{R}. This will hold if a is an odd integer since raising -x to an odd power yields a negative result. This means that, for instance, if a=3, then (-x)^3 = -x^3, which satisfies our condition. Considering both conditions, we deduce that a must be an odd integer to fulfill both requirements of the domain being all real numbers and the function being odd.

Therefore, planes alpha and beta do not intersect and are parallel to each other. 3. **Transitivity of Parallel Planes:** To derive the theorem on the transitivity of the parallelism relation among planes, consider planes alpha, beta, and gamma: 3.1. Let alpha parallel beta and beta parallel gamma. 3.2. Prove that alpha parallel gamma: 3.2.1. Take a line l intersecting plane alpha. 3.2.2. Given alpha parallel beta, line l will intersect plane beta at some point. 3.2.3. Because beta parallel gamma, line l will also intersect plane gamma at some point. 3.3. Since every line intersecting plane alpha also intersects plane gamma, it follows that alpha parallel gamma. Hence, the necessary and sufficient condition for the parallelism of two planes is that any line intersecting one of them also intersects the other. The transitivity of the parallelism relation among planes is thereby demonstrated. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"a plane, a set M consisting of n points is given, where no three points are collinear.

Prove that if (A) is a (B_{3})set, then (A = B).","completion":"1. **Equivalence of Difference Sets**: Since ( D(A) = D(B) ), we know that for any elements ( x, y in A ) and ( u, v in B ): [ { |x - y| mid x, y in A } = { |u - v| mid u, v in B } ] This means each difference ( b_i - b_{i-1} ) can be written as ( a_{f(i)} - a_{g(i)} ), where ( f(i) > g(i) geq 0 ). 2. **Forming Sum Equations**: Consider the difference ( b_{i+1} - b_{i-1} in D(B) = D(A) ). This expression can be represented as ( a_{alpha} - a_v ) for some ( u > v geq 0 ).

Proof by Contradiction: Assume ( i in R ) and ( i+1 in S ), i.e., ( g(i) = f(i+1) = g(i+2) ). There exist integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that: [ b_{i+2} - b_{i-1} = a_x - a_y ] Hence: [ a_x - a_y = a_{f(i+2)} - a_{g(i+2)} + a_{f(i+1)} - a_{g(i+1)} + a_{f(0)} - a_{g(i)} = a_{f(i+2)} + a_{f(0)} - a_{g(i+1)} - a_{g(i)} ] By the ( B_3 )-property: [ (x, g(i+1), g(i)) text{ and } (y, f(i+2), f(i)) text{ are identical up to permutation} ] But ( f(i+2), f(i) > g(i+2) = g(i) = f(i+1) > g(i+1) ), which is a contradiction. Hence, ( i in R) implies ( i + 1 in R ). 6. **Conclusion from the Lemma**: If ( i in R neq 0 ), it follows that every ( j > i ) also belongs to ( R ). This leads to: [ g(i) = f(i+1) > g(i+1) = f(i+2) > g(i+2) = f(i+3) > cdots ] which is an impossible infinite decreasing sequence of nonnegative integers.

Since |BF|=|AF'|, we can write |AF|+|BF|=2a. Step 3: Note that O is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of right triangle ABF, so |AB|=2c. Also, we can express |AF|=2csin alpha and |BF|=2ccos alpha. Step 4: Substitute the expressions for |AF| and |BF| into the equation from Step 2, yielding 2csin alpha +2ccos alpha =2a.

This is because the side length or ratio ensures that there are 3n potential triangles using A as one of the vertices, with an additional 6n triangles sharing the same vertex configuration: [ a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 9n ] - Triangles can be counted by the permutation of colors involving ( k ) red vertices: [ a_2 + 2a_3 = 3k ] - Solving these equations: [ a_3 - a_1 = 3k - 9n ] 5. **Evaluate the incremental change**: When adding the red vertex ( A ), the count of equilateral triangles P_{k+1} involving 3 vertices of the same color changes as follows: [ P_{k+1} = P_k + a_3 - a_1 ] With ( a_3 - a_1 = 3k - 9n ), the change is: [ P_{k+1} - P_k = 3k - 9n ] 6. **Initialization**: Initial condition when k=0 , all vertices are blue in 6n+1: [ P_0 = 3n (6n + 1) ] 7. **Summing the increments**: To find P_k, accumulate the increments from P_0 up to k: [ P_k = P_0 + sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (3i - 9n) ] Simplify using the sum formulas: [ sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = frac{k(k-1)}{2} ] Therefore: [ P_k = 3n(6n + 1) - 9kn + 3 sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = 3n(6n + 1) - 9kn + 3 left(frac{k(k-1)}{2}right) ] 8. **Final simplification**: Simplify the combined formula: [ P_k = 3n(6n + 1) - 9kn + frac{3}{2}k(k - 1) ] 9. **Conclusion**: The number of such equilateral triangles P_k is: [ boxed{P_k = 3n(6n + 1) - 9kn + frac{3}{2}k(k - 1) } ]"},{"prompt":"Suppose that 0^circ < A < 90^circ and 0^circ < B < 90^circ and [left(4+tan^2 Aright)left(5+tan^2 Bright) = sqrt{320}tan Atan B] Determine all possible values of cos Asin B .","completion":"1.

Let's solve this step by step. First, observe the given equation: m^{2}-2m-1=0. This implies that m is not equal to zero (mneq 0) because the equation is quadratic and has real roots. Rearranging the given equation slightly, we get: m^{2}-2m=1. Adding frac{1}{m^2} to both sides of the equation, we aim to form the expression m^2+frac{1}{m^2}: m^{2}-2m+frac{1}{m^2}=1+frac{1}{m^2}. Notice that m^{2}-2m+frac{1}{m^2} can be rewritten using the identity a^2 + frac{1}{a^2} = (a - frac{1}{a})^2 + 2 where a = m. Therefore, we have: m^2+frac{1}{m^2} = left(m-frac{1}{m}right)^{2}+2. From the given equation, we can also deduce that m - frac{1}{m} = 2. This is because rearranging the original equation gives us m-2=frac{1}{m}, which simplifies to m-frac{1}{m}=2. Substituting m - frac{1}{m} = 2 into the expression, we get: m^2+frac{1}{m^2} = 2^{2}+2 = 4 + 2 = 6.

Let x' = kb for some integer k. - There is also at least one number y' that is divisible by a. Let y' = la for some integer l. 4. **Cases Based on x' and y'**: - Case 1: If x' neq y', we are done because x = x' and y = y' will work. In this case, x = kb and y = la, and since a and b are distinct primes (or relatively prime components in ab), ab divides xy. - Case 2: If x' = y', then x' = y' = m, where m is divisible by both a and b.

Let z = kc. 8. **Combining Findings**: - Let x = x'', y = y'', z = kc. - Since ab divides x''y'' and z is divisible by c, the product xyz = (x'' y'') z = m cdot kc where m represents the product divisible by ab. - This arrangement ensures that abc divides xyz. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Proven}} ]"},{"prompt":"Among the following propositions, the number of true propositions is ( ) ① For all x in mathbb{R}, x^{2}x+ frac {1}{4} geq 0; ② There exists x > 0, such that ln x+ frac {1}{ln x} leq 2; ③ a > b is a necessary and sufficient condition for ac^{2} > bc^{2}; ④ y=2^{x}2^{x} is an odd function.

Therefore, the base case is true. 2. **Inductive Step:** Assuming the theorem holds for any k half-spaces, we aim to prove it for k+1 half-spaces. Let H_1, H_2, ldots, H_{k+1} be the half-spaces. By the induction hypothesis, every k of these half-spaces have a common point. We need to demonstrate that all (k+1) half-spaces have a common intersection point.

Also, since ( angle C = 40^circ ), we can write: [ angle CFE = angle ACB - angle FEC = 40^circ - 20^circ = 20^circ ] 4. This implies that triangle ( triangle FEC ) is isosceles with ( CF = CE ). 5.

Since ( angle AFD = 20^circ ) (as it is equal to ( angle CFE )), and ( angle ADF ) is an exterior angle to triangle ( triangle BDE ). Hence: [ angle ADF > angle BED = 20^circ ] by the Exterior Angle Theorem, which states that an exterior angle of a triangle is greater than either of the opposite interior angles. 7. In triangle ( triangle ADF ), since ( angle ADF ) is greater than ( angle AFD ), it follows that the side opposite to ( angle ADF ) which is ( AF ) is longer than the side opposite to ( angle AFD ) which is ( AD ).

For example: [ ++|+++|--- implies 0 stackrel{+2}{longrightarrow} 2 stackrel{+3}{longrightarrow} 5 stackrel{-3}{longrightarrow} 2 ] - For ( N(a) ), we need ( frac{2019 + a}{2} ) ( + )'s and ( frac{2019 - a}{2} ) ( - )'s. - A sequence is \\"bad\\" if there are an odd number of ways to insert ( | ). 4. **Bad Sequences:** - A sequence is bad if it has no consecutive ( ++ ) or ( -- ). Thus, the only bad sequences are ( +-+-+ ldots ) and ( -+-+- ldots ). - These sequences correspond to ( N(1) ) and ( N(-1) ).

Thus, options A and B are eliminated. Furthermore, since g(x) = 2^{-x+1} = 2^{-(x-1)} is obtained by shifting the graph of y = 2^{-x} to the right by 1, its graph must also pass through the point (1, 1), as well as the point (0, 2).

We call a string S **balanced** if every substring T of (consecutive symbols) S has the property 2 leq @(T) leq 2 . (Thus XOOXOOX is not balanced since it contains the substring OOXOO whose @ value is 3 .) Find, with proof, the number of balanced strings of length n .","completion":"To find the number of balanced strings of length ( n ), we need to ensure that every substring ( T ) of ( S ) satisfies ( -2 leq @(T) leq 2 ). We will use the face values of ( X ) and ( O ) to help us analyze the problem. 1. **Define Face Values:** - Let the face value of ( X ) be ( 1 ). - Let the face value of ( O ) be ( -1 ). 2. **Sum of Face Values:** - Let ( S_k ) be the sum of the face values of the first ( k ) elements of the string ( S ). - A string is balanced if and only if for any two indices ( l ) and ( m ), ( S_l - S_m in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} ). 3. **Difference Between Consecutive Elements:** - Clearly, ( S_k ) and ( S_{k+1} ) can differ only by ( 1 ) (since the face values are either ( 1 ) or ( -1 )). - Therefore, if we write a sequence for ( S_i ), say ( 1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, 1 ), we are actually referring to the sequence ( XOOXOXX ), which satisfies the given conditions. 4. **Balanced Sequence Construction:** - To construct a balanced sequence of ( S_i ), we need to ensure that the sequence remains within the bounds of ({-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}). 5. **Rules for Writing Balanced Sequences:** - Assume that the first character of the balanced string is ( X ). At the end, we will double our answer to account for the strings starting with ( O ). - Each ( S_i ) string thus starts with ( 1 ). 6. **Possible Characters in ( S_i ):** - Note that in each string of ( S_i ), there can only appear ( 3 ) different characters. - These may be ({-1, 0, 1}) or ({0, 1, 2}). The value ( -2 ) cannot appear as ( 1 ) exists in the string. 7. **Counting Balanced Strings:** - Consider each of the above two cases and count the number of possible strings in each case. The easiest way is to find manually for trivial cases, then prove by induction. Let's start with small values of ( n ) and build up: - For ( n = 1 ): - The possible strings are ( X ) and ( O ). - Total: ( 2 ). - For ( n = 2 ): - The possible strings are ( XX, XO, OX, OO ). - Total: ( 4 ). - For ( n = 3 ): - The possible strings are ( XXX, XXO, XOX, XOO, OXX, OXO, OOX, OOO ). - Total: ( 8 ). We observe that for each additional character, the number of balanced strings doubles. This is because each balanced string of length ( n ) can be extended by either ( X ) or ( O ) while maintaining the balance condition. By induction, we can prove that the number of balanced strings of length ( n ) is ( 2^n ).
