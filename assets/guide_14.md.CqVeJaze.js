GENESIS LABORATORY - ED’S LAB – DAY The clinical hum of lab machinery mixes with muted discussions from ED’s team, immersed in intense work. DR. EDWARD “ED” KAYNES (30s), observes confidently amidst the activity. ED (to his team) The future is in our hands. By nightfall, we’ll see if we can control it. MARIA, Ed’s wife, watches the reanimated rat uneasily. MARIA (shocked) Ed… are you sure about this? Maria meets Ed’s gaze as he draws the injection. Promise and peril shimmer within. Нe injects the rat - it springs to alarming life. Gasps around the lab. TEAM MEMBER #1 (troubled) We’ve disrupted nature’s course. What have we done? ED (solemnly) There’s no going back now. We have unleashed something beyond our control. Night envelopes the city as they depart the lab, sealing Pandora’s box with a tense kiss - flawed creators of a warped legacy.

Much work still lies ahead, but we have unlocked promising possibilities. Murmurs ripple through the room. DR. ALLEN rises, looking doubtful. DR. ALLEN (cautiously) Dr. Kaynes, your claims about “eternal life” sound too good to be true. What precautions are you taking to prevent unintended consequences? ED (making eye contact) We appreciate your questions. Safety is our priority - guiding each phase with care. MARIA joins Ed at the podium, her eyes shining with optimism. MARIA (supportively) Just imagine if more people could fulfill their life’s purpose. If we could give that gift of time - to nurture their dreams and strengthen bonds with loved ones. Thunderous applause erupts, though some still look uneasy. ED and MARIA stand united yet vulnerable, poised between revelatory success or devastating failure. An immense legacy hangs in the balance. END PAGE 3 OF 150 PAGE 4 OF 150 INT. ED AND MARIA’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Ed pours two glasses of wine. He hands one to Maria, their fingers brush with the exchange. A spark of connection in their touch. MARIA (lifting her glass in a toast) Here’s to us and turning dreams into reality! ED (takes his glass and gazes affectionately) Maria, love…your presence fills my world with joy. MARIA (smiles warmly, touching his arm) You support me through all the ups and downs. I couldn’t wish for a better partner than you. Maria turns on gentle music and pulls Ed close. MARIA (embraces him for a dance) Dance with me…? She lays her head on his shoulder, and they begin to slow dance. MARIA (eyes closed, lost in the moment) Just you and me before chaos erupts. Ed tightens his embrace, finding comfort in the closeness. ED (his voice soft, a whisper in her hair) Whatever comes, we’ll face it together. Maria looks up into Ed’s eyes, searching for reassurance. MARIA (a hint of worry) Our creation…have we erred? What if it destroys this city we love? Ed strokes her face, offering solace in his touch. ED (gazes deeply, with a reassuring softness) The future awaits, undefined. Each choice impacts what happens next. But know this… He pauses, his gaze warming. ED (LOVINGLY) No matter what happens, we have each other. He pulls her closer until their eyes are just inches apart. ED (softly) I love you, Maria… He kisses her tenderly. She returns his kiss, running her fingers through his hair. The music and lights gently fade as they get lost in each other’s embrace, their worries momentarily forgotten in the passion of this perfect moment together. END PAGE 4 OF 150 PAGE 5 OF 150 INT.

Send alerts now! VOICE ON PHONE (shocked) Revived? What’s going on? ED (yelling in panic) It escaped its cage somehow! We must contain that rat before this gets worse! Get all available staff here now! (more shaken) We’ve created a monster…I fear this outbreak is only the beginning… Alarms continue blasting. The lab, once representing human progress, feels threatening. ED watches security footage showing the reanimated rat escaping, movements erratic and ominous. An alarm beats steadily like the ticking of a timebomb. The silence in between Poundingly loud. It’s the quiet before chaos unleashes across the city. Before the dead walk. END PAGE 5 OF 150 PAGE 6 OF 150 INT. GENESIS LAB – RESEARCH FLOOR – DAY The urgent rhythm of GENESIS Lab mirrors the fast pace of SCIENCE CITY outside.

Natsuki should’ve been here by now!” MC: “I haven’t heard anything from her at all.” Yuri: “Maybe she just overslept or something?” (I couldn’t help but feel a sense of concern. Natsuki’s usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon. We were naming them “Shinwa”, “Jinsei”, and “Desu” after the three spirit schools of the game “Wizard101” - Shinwa meaning “Myth”, Jinsei meaning “Life”, and Desu meaning “Death”. However, I was feeling some cramps at the time. It’s at this moment that Yuri notices me rubbing my belly.) Yuri: “Sayori, are you feeling alright? You seem to be in discomfort.” Sayori: “I’m okay, just some cramps. It’s probably nothing, but they’re more intense than usual.” MC: “Hey, maybe you should take it easy. You’re at a pretty advanced stage of your pregnancy, after all. Shall I get you some water or anything?” (MC gently puts a hand on mine as Jinsei - the most active of our babies - starts to kick.) Sayori: (smiling weakly) “Water would be nice, thank you, MC.” (MC rushes out of the room to get some water. Monika, meanwhile, seems caught between managing her concern for me and the absence of Natsuki.) Monika: “Okay everyone, let’s remain calm. We’ll reach out to Natsuki’s family to make sure she’s okay. In the meantime, let’s make sure Sayori is comfortable. Yuri, can you please help with that?” (Yuri nods and moves closer to me with a concerned look.) Yuri: “Is there a particular spot where we could make you more comfortable? Maybe we could get some pillows to support your back.” Sayori: “Some extra pillows would be really nice, Yuri. Thank you.” (Yuri quickly gathers some cushions from around the clubroom and arranges them on the couch for me to lean against. I take a seat and try to find a position that eases the cramping. The movements in my belly seem to calm down a little with the gentle pressure.) (Yuri now turns to Monika and speaks in a lower voice, hoping I wouldn’t overhear their concerned conversation.) Yuri: “Monika, should we consider calling a doctor? Sayori’s discomfort might be more significant than we’re assuming.” Monika: (looks at me with a serious expression) “Yes, that might be necessary. But let’s not worry her just yet. Once MC is back with the water, we should talk it over with him first.” (MC returns with a glass of water and hands it to me.) MC: “Here you go, Sayori. Drink slowly. How are you feeling now?” Sayori: “A little better, thanks. The pillows help, and the water is refreshing.” (MC takes a seat beside me, holding my hand. He glances at Monika and Yuri with a look that suggests he’s seeking guidance. Just then, I felt a sudden warmth moving down my legs. Panic immediately set in - my water had just broken. The cramps I had been feeling were actually the onset of labor.) Sayori: (voice shaking) “MC, my water just broke.” (MC’s eyes widen with a mixture of surprise and concern.) MC: “Oh no. We need to get you to the hospital, fast!” (Monika immediately grabs her phone and starts dialing.) Monika: “I’m calling an ambulance right now.” Yuri: (visibly stressed but trying to stay composed) “Sayori, just try to relax and breathe. We’re here for you.” (The room fills with a sense of urgency. MC is by my side, holding my hand and speaking reassuring words, trying his best to keep me calm.) MC: “It’s going to be okay, Sayori. Just focus on breathing. We’re going to meet Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu very soon.” (Monika looks up from her phone.) Monika: “The ambulance will be here any minute. Sayori, can you stand with help, or do we need to carry you?” Sayori: “I think…I think I can stand if you help me.” (Two members of the literature club support me on either side as we slowly make our way to the front of the school to wait for the ambulance. My contractions are growing closer together, signaling that the babies are eager to arrive. And then…I could feel urge to push.) Sayori: (panting) “Oh gosh, I need to push…” MC: “Hold on, Sayori! Try not to push yet. The paramedics will be here soon, and they’ll help with everything.” (Monika is on the phone giving our location to the emergency dispatcher, updating on the situation, and Yuri is breathing in sync with me, trying to help me manage the contractions as I battle against the urge to push. There’s a clear sense of unity amongst everyone in the literature club as they work together to ensure both my safety and the safety of the babies.) Yuri: “Just keep taking deep breaths, Sayori. Focus on my voice. We’re all here with you.” (The minutes tick by slowly, and each second feels longer than the last. Everything was happening so fast. Just then, the pain became unbearable. Panic set in again - the urge","completion":"to push was too strong. I couldn't hold back any longer. Sayori: (straining) \\"They're coming! I can't wait any longer.\\" (The sounds of the ambulance could be heard in the distance, but the pressure and the instinct to push were overwhelming. MC, seeing my distress, encourages me.) MC: \\"It's okay, Sayori! Do what you need to do. You're strong, and we've got you.\\" (Yuri and Monika exchange frantic looks. Yuri quickly moves to a position where she can assist me, prepared to provide support if needed before the professionals arrive. Monika, on the other hand, continues to communicate our urgency to the dispatchers.) Monika: \\"Please hurry, the situation is critical!\\" (The siren's wail grows louder, promising that help is near. MC, still beside me, wipes my brow with a handkerchief. Despite the situation being far from what we planned, there was a sense of closeness and determination in his eyes.) MC: \\"Just a bit longer, we're so close to getting you the help you need.\\" (As the ambulance pulls up to the school, paramedics rush out with a stretcher and equipment. They quickly assess the situation and get ready to assist.) Paramedic: \\"Ma’am, we're here to help you. Try to stay calm and let us do our work.\\" (I was carefully moved onto the stretcher, feeling overwhelmed, yet grateful for the swift action the paramedics took. The sense of urgency conveyed by my friends had paid off, and professional help had arrived just in time.) Sayori: \\"Thank you, everyone. Please, take care of the babies.\\" (The paramedics assure me as they load the stretcher into the ambulance. MC is allowed to accompany me, taking his place by my side, ready to support me through the delivery. The doors close behind us, and the ambulance takes off, racing towards the hospital with its precious cargo.) (In the clubroom, Monika and Yuri stand in the empty space left behind, a mix of relief and concern etched onto their faces. They had come together when it mattered the most, a testament to the bond that they shared within their literature club family. Now, they could only wait and hope for the safe arrival of Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu.)"},{"prompt":"Оригинальный сюжет игры Ben and Ed: Игра “Ben and Ed” - это трехмерный платформер, где игрок управляет зомби по имени Эд, который должен преодолевать множество препятствий и ловушек, чтобы спасти своего лучшего друга, мальчика по имени Бен.

Но он не сдается, толкаемый инстинктом выживания и любовью к своей семье, которую он должен найти вне зависимости от своего нового облика. Фонари аварийного освещения мигают в последнем акте отчаяния, когда Эд, собирая остатки сил, начинает осматривать бункер в поисках инструментов и предметов, которые помогут ему добраться до коммуникационного оборудования.

I couldn’t wish for a better partner than you. Maria turns on gentle music and pulls Ed close. MARIA (embraces him for a dance) Dance with me…? She lays her head on his shoulder, and they begin to slow dance. MARIA (eyes closed, lost in the moment) Just you and me before chaos erupts. Ed tightens his embrace, finding comfort in the closeness. ED (his voice soft, a whisper in her hair) Whatever comes, we’ll face it together. Maria looks up into Ed’s eyes, searching for reassurance. MARIA (a hint of worry) Our creation…have we erred? What if it destroys this city we love? Ed strokes her face, offering solace in his touch. ED (gazes deeply, with a reassuring softness) The future awaits, undefined. Each choice impacts what happens next. But know this… He pauses, his gaze warming. ED (LOVINGLY) No matter what happens, we have each other. He pulls her closer until their eyes are just inches apart. ED (softly) I love you, Maria… He kisses her tenderly. She returns his kiss, running her fingers through his hair.

Natsuki should’ve been here by now!” MC: “I haven’t heard anything from her at all.” Yuri: “Maybe she just overslept or something?” (I couldn’t help but feel a sense of concern. Natsuki’s usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon. We were naming them “Shinwa”, “Jinsei”, and “Desu” after the three spirit schools of the game “Wizard101” - Shinwa meaning “Myth”, Jinsei meaning “Life”, and Desu meaning “Death”. However, I was feeling some cramps at the time. It’s at this moment that Yuri notices me rubbing my belly.) Yuri: “Sayori, are you feeling alright? You seem to be in discomfort.” Sayori: “I’m okay, just some cramps. It’s probably nothing, but they’re more intense than usual.” MC: “Hey, maybe you should take it easy. You’re at a pretty advanced stage of your pregnancy, after all. Shall I get you some water or anything?” (MC gently puts a hand on mine as Jinsei - the most active of our babies - starts to kick.) Sayori: (smiling weakly) “Water would be nice, thank you, MC.” (MC rushes out of the room to get some water. Monika, meanwhile, seems caught between managing her concern for me and the absence of Natsuki.) Monika: “Okay everyone, let’s remain calm. We’ll reach out to Natsuki’s family to make sure she’s okay. In the meantime, let’s make sure Sayori is comfortable. Yuri, can you please help with that?” (Yuri nods and moves closer to me with a concerned look.) Yuri: “Is there a particular spot where we could make you more comfortable? Maybe we could get some pillows to support your back.” Sayori: “Some extra pillows would be really nice, Yuri. Thank you.” (Yuri quickly gathers some cushions from around the clubroom and arranges them on the couch for me to lean against. I take a seat and try to find a position that eases the cramping. The movements in my belly seem to calm down a little with the gentle pressure.) (Yuri now turns to Monika and speaks in a lower voice, hoping I wouldn’t overhear their concerned conversation.) Yuri: “Monika, should we consider calling a doctor? Sayori’s discomfort might be more significant than we’re assuming.” Monika: (looks at me with a serious expression) “Yes, that might be necessary. But let’s not worry her just yet. Once MC is back with the water, we should talk it over with him first.” (MC returns with a glass of water and hands it to me.) MC: “Here you go, Sayori. Drink slowly. How are you feeling now?” Sayori: “A little better, thanks. The pillows help, and the water is refreshing.” (MC takes a seat beside me, holding my hand. He glances at Monika and Yuri with a look that suggests he’s seeking guidance. Just then, I felt a sudden warmth moving down my legs. Panic immediately set in - my water had just broken. The cramps I had been feeling were actually the onset of labor.) Sayori: (voice shaking) “MC, my water just broke.” (MC’s eyes widen with a mixture of surprise and concern.) MC: “Oh no. We need to get you to the hospital, fast!” (Monika immediately grabs her phone and starts dialing.) Monika: “I’m calling an ambulance right now.” Yuri: (visibly stressed but trying to stay composed) “Sayori, just try to relax and breathe. We’re here for you.” (The room fills with a sense of urgency. MC is by my side, holding my hand and speaking reassuring words, trying his best to keep me calm.) MC: “It’s going to be okay, Sayori. Just focus on breathing. We’re going to meet Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu very soon.” (Monika looks up from her phone.) Monika: “The ambulance will be here any minute. Sayori, can you stand with help, or do we need to carry you?” Sayori: “I think…I think I can stand if you help me.” (Two members of the literature club support me on either side as we slowly make our way to the front of the school to wait for the ambulance. My contractions are growing closer together, signaling that the babies are eager to arrive. And then…I could feel urge to push.) Sayori: (panting) “Oh gosh, I need to push…” MC: “Hold on, Sayori! Try not to push yet. The paramedics will be here soon, and they’ll help with everything.” (Monika is on the phone giving our location to the emergency dispatcher, updating on the situation, and Yuri is breathing in sync with me, trying to help me manage the contractions as I battle against the urge to push. There’s a clear sense of unity amongst everyone in the literature club as they work together to ensure both my safety and the safety of the babies.) Yuri: “Just keep taking deep breaths, Sayori. Focus on my voice. We’re all here with you.” (The minutes tick by slowly, and each second feels longer than the last. Everything was happening so fast. Just then, the pain became unbearable. Panic set in again - the urge to push was too strong. I couldn’t hold back any longer. This was it - the babies","completion":"were coming now, whether we were ready or not. Monika: (urgently into the phone) “The baby is coming now! We can’t wait any longer!” MC: “Stay strong, Sayori! You’re doing great. Just do what your body is telling you to, and I'm here, okay?” Sayori: (with a mixture of fear and determination) “I can't wait... I need to push!” (The sound of approaching sirens offered a glimmer of hope, but it was evident that there might not be enough time to wait for their arrival. The literature club, inexperienced and scared, nonetheless rallied around me. Yuri had read enough to know the basics of what to do and Monika, always collected in a crisis, provided encouragement and support.) (As the first of the emergency vehicles pulled up to the school, paramedics quickly rushed out with their equipment. Despite their prompt arrival, the babies were already making their way into the world. With their expert guidance, my friends mustered the courage to assist in the delivery. It was a chaotic orchestra of encouragement, guidance, and support.) Paramedic: “Okay everyone, we’re here now. Keep calm. We’ll take over. Can you tell me your name, ma’am?” Sayori: (between contractions) “Sa-Sayori. My name is Sayori.” Paramedic: “Alright, Sayori. My name is Lisa, and we’re going to help you deliver your babies safely. I need you to listen to me very closely. Can you do that?” Sayori: (nodding) “Yes, yes I can.” (The paramedics worked efficiently, preparing for the delivery right there at the school entrance. The first baby, Shinwa, was born with a strong yet small cry, quickly followed by Jinsei, whose kicks I had known so well. Desu arrived last, small but fierce with life. The three souls I had been carrying were now in my arms, with MC by my side, tears of joy glistening in our eyes.) MC: (overcome with emotion) “They're perfect, Sayori. We did it. They're here.” (The three new lives we had created together were small miracles, each bearing a name that held special meaning to us in their quiet cries and peaceful gazes. The literature club members, meanwhile, were exhaling relieved sighs and crying tears of their own, amazed at the life-affirming event they had just witnessed and participated in.) Monika: (with a tearful smile) “You did amazing, Sayori.” Yuri: “They're beautiful. Just like a story with a happy beginning.” (The paramedics made sure that the babies and I were stable and healthy before we were transported to the hospital for further care. The encounter had tied the literature club together with bonds stronger than any before – they had helped usher in new life and faced the raw and powerful reality of birth together.) Sayori: “Thank you, everyone. I couldn't have done this without you.” (And as the ambulance drove away, the sun setting behind the school, the members of the literature club stood together, a unit forever changed by the profound experience of love, life, and unity.)"},{"prompt":"Оригинальный сюжет игры Ben and Ed: Игра “Ben and Ed” - это трехмерный платформер, где игрок управляет зомби по имени Эд, который должен преодолевать множество препятствий и ловушек, чтобы спасти своего лучшего друга, мальчика по имени Бен.

Natsuki should’ve been here by now!” MC: “I haven’t heard anything from her at all.” Yuri: “Maybe she just overslept or something?” (I couldn’t help but feel a sense of concern. Natsuki’s usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon. We were naming them “Shinwa”, “Jinsei”, and “Desu” after the three spirit schools of the game “Wizard101” - Shinwa meaning “Myth”, Jinsei meaning “Life”, and Desu meaning “Death”. However, I was feeling some cramps at the time. It’s at this moment that Yuri notices me rubbing my belly.) Yuri: “Sayori, are you feeling alright? You seem to be in discomfort.” Sayori: “I’m okay, just some cramps. It’s probably nothing, but they’re more intense than usual.” MC: “Hey, maybe you should take it easy. You’re at a pretty advanced stage of your pregnancy, after all. Shall I get you some water or anything?” (MC gently puts a hand on mine as Jinsei - the most active of our babies - starts to kick.) Sayori: (smiling weakly) “Water would be nice, thank you, MC.” (MC rushes out of the room to get some water. Monika, meanwhile, seems caught between managing her concern for me and the absence of Natsuki.) Monika: “Okay everyone, let’s remain calm. We’ll reach out to Natsuki’s family to make sure she’s okay. In the meantime, let’s make sure Sayori is comfortable. Yuri, can you please help with that?” (Yuri nods and moves closer to me with a concerned look.) Yuri: “Is there a particular spot where we could make you more comfortable? Maybe we could get some pillows to support your back.” Sayori: “Some extra pillows would be really nice, Yuri. Thank you.” (Yuri quickly gathers some cushions from around the clubroom and arranges them on the couch for me to lean against. I take a seat and try to find a position that eases the cramping. The movements in my belly seem to calm down a little with the gentle pressure.) (Yuri now turns to Monika and speaks in a lower voice, hoping I wouldn’t overhear their concerned conversation.) Yuri: “Monika, should we consider calling a doctor? Sayori’s discomfort might be more significant than we’re assuming.” Monika: (looks at me with a serious expression) “Yes, that might be necessary. But let’s not worry her just yet. Once MC is back with the water, we should talk it over with him first.” (MC returns with a glass of water and hands it to me.) MC: “Here you go, Sayori. Drink slowly. How are you feeling now?” Sayori: “A little better, thanks. The pillows help, and the water is refreshing.” (MC takes a seat beside me, holding my hand. He glances at Monika and Yuri with a look that suggests he’s seeking guidance. Just then, I felt a sudden warmth moving down my legs. Panic immediately set in - my water had just broken. The cramps I had been feeling were actually the onset of labor.) Sayori: (voice shaking) “MC, my water just broke.” (MC’s eyes widen with a mixture of surprise and concern.) MC: “Oh no. We need to get you to the hospital, fast!” (Monika immediately grabs her phone and starts dialing.) Monika: “I’m calling an ambulance right now.” Yuri: (visibly stressed but trying to stay composed) “Sayori, just try to relax and breathe. We’re here for you.” (The room fills with a sense of urgency. MC is by my side, holding my hand and speaking reassuring words, trying his best to keep me calm.) MC: “It’s going to be okay, Sayori. Just focus on breathing. We’re going to meet Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu very soon.” (Monika looks up from her phone.) Monika: “The ambulance will be here any minute. Sayori, can you stand with help, or do we need to carry you?” Sayori: “I think…I think I can stand if you help me.” (Two members of the literature club support me on either side as we slowly make our way to the front of the school to wait for the ambulance. My contractions are growing closer together, signaling that the babies are eager to arrive. And then…I could feel urge to push.) Sayori: (panting) “Oh gosh, I need to push…” MC: “Hold on, Sayori! Try not to push yet. The paramedics will be here soon, and they’ll help with everything.” (Monika is on the phone giving our location to the emergency dispatcher, updating on the situation, and Yuri is breathing in sync with me, trying to help me manage the contractions as I battle against the urge to push. There’s a clear sense of unity amongst everyone in the literature club as they work together to ensure both my safety and the safety of the babies.) Yuri: “Just keep taking deep breaths, Sayori. Focus on my voice. We’re all here with you.” (The minutes tick by slowly, and each second feels longer than the last. Everything was happening so fast. Just then, the pain became unbearable. Panic set in again - the urge to push was too strong. I couldn’t hold back any longer. This was it - the babies were coming now, whether we were ready or not.

Relief washed over Monika's face as she spotted the flashing lights pulling up to the school.) Monika: (shouting over to us) \\"They're here!

MC was allowed to accompany me, holding my hand all the while, as we were whisked away to the hospital. Yuri and Monika watched us go, a mix of concern and hope on their faces.) Monika: (turning to Yuri) \\"She's going to be fine, right?\\" Yuri: (with a faint smile) \\"Yes, she will be. She's Sayori, after all.\\" (The ambulance lights faded into the distance, leaving the literature club members behind to process what had just happened. They had all come together in a crisis, showing the strength of their friendship. Meanwhile, I concentrated on the reassuring voices of MC and the paramedics, riding the waves of contractions and the whirlwind of emotions, anticipation growing inside me to meet Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu—the names we had so lovingly chosen.) Sayori: (to MC with determination in her voice) \\"We can do this. For our babies.\\" (MC, with a mix of concern and awe, watched me with pride and love.) MC: \\"We absolutely can.

We might need to do this here if the ambulance doesn't make it in time.\\" Yuri does as instructed, her hands barely trembling as she switches the call to speaker mode and speaks clearly and calmly to the dispatcher, explaining the urgency.

I’m lying on my back, my knees bent, MC still holding my hand, and Yuri resting her hand on my forehead, trying to soothe me. Monika: (to the dispatcher) \\"Yes, she's on the ground now. What should we do?\\" Dispatcher's Voice: \\"I am going to guide you through this. Ensure her privacy to the best of your ability, and make sure her lower body is exposed.

Monika: \\"The ambulance is almost here! Hang in there, Sayori!\\" But the relief is short-lived, as I can't fight the pressure anymore. The agonizing need to push is overriding any semblance of patience I had left. I start pushing, unable to stop, the pain and fear acting as a vice around my senses.

Monika, ever the leader, prepares to catch the baby, following the dispatcher's instructions as MC and Yuri provide emotional support. The wail of the siren grows louder, the paramedics rushing toward us just in time to take over. The professionals quickly step in, guiding me through the final stages of delivery. With their help, I bring the first baby, Shinwa, into the world right there in front of the school. The paramedics ensure the newborn is breathing and wrapped before proceeding to help with the birth of the other two, Jinsei and Desu. There are tears of joy, relief, and fear as each baby is born, and the literature club stands by me, a strong support system bound together by the unexpected circumstances. This was a story we were all unlikely to forget, a real-life dramatic episode surpassing any plot we could have read or written in our club. Once the chaos settles, with the babies safely delivered and everyone processing the intensity of the moment, I'm loaded onto a stretcher and transported to the hospital, babies in tow. MC rides alongside, and my friends follow, a testament to the bond we've formed. And as I look up at the faces of my friends, gratitude fills my heart. They stood by me in one of my life's most vulnerable moments, and it is something I — and surely Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu — will never forget."},{"prompt":"Prepare a very small report on the topic of my visit to a science museum. Mention that you saw old steam trains and the famous DNA model.","completion":"Title: A Journey Through Science and Innovation: My Visit to the Science Museum Introduction: On a quest for knowledge and a touch of nostalgia, I ventured into the halls of the renowned Science Museum, an establishment dedicated to showcasing the wonders of scientific progress and the history of innovation. The museum serves as a bridge between the past and the future, providing visitors with a unique opportunity to witness the evolution of technology and understand the building blocks of life itself. Exhibition Overview: The museum's exhibitions are meticulously curated to enlighten and inspire, and during my visit, two displays stood out: the gallery featuring old steam trains and the exhibit presenting the famous DNA model. Each section was an immersive experience, inviting me into different realms of science and technology. The Steam Train Exhibition: As I meandered through the steam train exhibit, I found myself surrounded by the grandeur of the Industrial Revolution's most iconic inventions. The gargantuan locomotives, with their polished metalwork and intricate engineering, spoke volumes of an era when steam was the lifeblood of progress. The oldest trains on display were a testament to the innovative spirit of the 19th century, showcasing the transition from horsepower to mechanical might. Each train bore its unique story, some adorned with ornate designs reflecting the elegance of travel in bygone days, while others stood as workhorses of the Industrial Age – massive machines that powered nations into modernity. The exhibit successfully captured the essence of an age when steam trains were the pinnacle of transportation and technological excellence. The DNA Model Exhibit: Further into my museum journey, I encountered the iconic DNA model, a symbol of one of the most significant scientific discoveries of the 20th century. The double helix structure, first revealed by James Watson and Francis Crick, revolutionized our understanding of genetic coding and inheritance. The model on display was a faithful representation of the groundbreaking discovery, complete with the intertwined strands and rungs, mirroring the ladder-like arrangement of the molecular masterpiece. Accompanying the model were interactive displays and informative plaques that explained the significance of DNA in the development of modern biology and medicine. The exhibit provided an insightful glimpse into how this singular discovery has paved the way for advancements in genetic engineering, forensics, and the ongoing quest to comprehend the very fabric of life itself. Conclusion: My visit to the Science Museum was an enriching experience that highlighted the continuities and breaks of human innovation. From the powerful locomotives that once ruled the railways, to the molecular code that defines our very existence, each exhibit provided a narrative of how far we have come and the limitless potential that lies ahead. The museum not only commemorated the milestones of our scientific history but also upheld the spirit of discovery that inspires future explorations and achievements. As I left the museum, I carried with me a renewed appreciation for the relentless pursuit of knowledge and the indelible impact of science on our ever-evolving world."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “This is ridiculous! Natsuki should’ve been here by now!” MC: “I haven’t heard anything from her at all.” Yuri: “Maybe she just overslept or something?” (I couldn’t help but feel a sense of concern. Natsuki’s usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon. We were naming them “Shinwa”, “Jinsei”, and “Desu” after the three spirit schools of the game “Wizard101” - Shinwa meaning “Myth”, Jinsei meaning “Life”, and Desu meaning “Death”. However, I was feeling some cramps at the time. It’s at this moment that Yuri notices me rubbing my belly.) Yuri: “Sayori, are you feeling alright? You seem to be in discomfort.” Sayori: “I’m okay, just some cramps. It’s probably nothing, but they’re more intense than usual.” MC: “Hey, maybe you should take it easy. You’re at a pretty advanced stage of your pregnancy, after all. Shall I get you some water or anything?” (MC gently puts a hand on mine as Jinsei - the most active of our babies - starts to kick.) Sayori: (smiling weakly) “Water would be nice, thank you, MC.” (MC rushes out of the room to get some water. Monika, meanwhile, seems caught between managing her concern for me and the absence of Natsuki.) Monika: “Okay everyone, let’s remain calm. We’ll reach out to Natsuki’s family to make sure she’s okay. In the meantime, let’s make sure Sayori is comfortable. Yuri, can you please help with that?” (Yuri nods and moves closer to me with a concerned look.) Yuri: “Is there a particular spot where we could make you more comfortable? Maybe we could get some pillows to support your back.” Sayori: “Some extra pillows would be really nice, Yuri. Thank you.” (Yuri quickly gathers some cushions from around the clubroom and arranges them on the couch for me to lean against. I take a seat and try to find a position that eases the cramping. The movements in my belly seem to calm down a little with the gentle pressure.) (Yuri now turns to Monika and speaks in a lower voice, hoping I wouldn’t overhear their concerned conversation.) Yuri: “Monika, should we consider calling a doctor? Sayori’s discomfort might be more significant than we’re assuming.” Monika: (looks at me with a serious expression) “Yes, that might be necessary. But let’s not worry her just yet. Once MC is back with the water, we should talk it over with him first.” (MC returns with a glass of water and hands it to me.) MC: “Here you go, Sayori. Drink slowly. How are you feeling now?” Sayori: “A little better, thanks. The pillows help, and the water is refreshing.” (MC takes a seat beside me, holding my hand. He glances at Monika and Yuri with a look that suggests he’s seeking guidance. Just then, I felt a sudden warmth moving down my legs. Panic immediately set in - my water had just broken. The cramps I had been feeling were actually the onset of labor.) Sayori: (voice shaking) “MC, my water just broke.” (MC’s eyes widen with a mixture of surprise and concern.) MC: “Oh no.

Just focus on breathing. We’re going to meet Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu very soon.” (Monika looks up from her phone.) Monika: “The ambulance will be here any minute. Sayori, can you stand with help, or do we need to carry you?” Sayori: “I think…I think I can stand if you help me.” (Two members of the literature club support me on either side as we slowly make our way to the front of the school to wait for the ambulance. My contractions are growing closer together, signaling that the babies are eager to arrive. And then…I could feel urge to push.) Sayori: (panting) “Oh gosh, I need to push…” MC: “Hold on, Sayori! Try not to push yet. The paramedics will be here soon, and they’ll help with everything.” (Monika is on the phone giving our location to the emergency dispatcher, updating on the situation, and Yuri is breathing in sync with me, trying to help me manage the contractions as I battle against the urge to push. There’s a clear sense of unity amongst everyone in the literature club as they work together to ensure both my safety and the safety of the babies.) Yuri: “Just keep taking deep breaths, Sayori.

The relief that help was about to arrive clashed with the intensity of my contractions. The paramedics burst onto the scene, professional and efficient, taking charge of the situation immediately.

Monika, Yuri, and MC followed close behind, their faces etched with concern but also a nervous excitement about the impending births. Once the ambulance doors were closed, the world outside was a blur. Inside, focused medical attention was all on me as one of the paramedics coached my breathing and prepared for the delivery. The other two made ready the necessary medical equipment and radioed the hospital for a prep team to be on standby. The contractions were relentless, one after another, but with the encouragement of the medical team and MC's unwavering support, I pushed with all the strength I had left. The pain was like nothing I had ever experienced, but with each push, I knew I was closer to meeting our children. After an eternity and what seemed like the hardest physical challenge of my life, the sound of a baby's cry finally cut through the tension. The paramedic lifted a tiny, wriggling form, announcing the arrival of Shinwa. Tears of joy and exhaustion streamed down my face as I heard the cry of Jinsei soon after, followed by a quieter, but equally miraculous cry from Desu, our third and last baby. The rush to the hospital afterwards was a blur, filled with the soft mewling of our newborns and the comforting voices of the paramedics and MC. It was chaos, it was terrifying, and it was beautiful.

The paramedics arrived—professionals trained for exactly these types of emergencies. They quickly assessed the situation and prepared to transport me to the hospital. They expertly moved me onto a stretcher, and with MC’s firm grip on my hand, they whisked us away from the school. Inside the ambulance, the paramedics did everything they could to make me comfortable and monitor my condition as we sped towards the hospital. MC stayed by my side, whispering words of encouragement and love, assuring me that everything was going to be alright. MC: “You’re so strong, Sayori. I’m right here with you. You’re doing great.” The ambulance arrived at the hospital, and I was hurried into the maternity ward where a team of doctors and nurses took over. I was rushed into the delivery room, the pain and pressure commanding my full attention as I listened to the medical staff guiding me through the process. Time seemed to blur together in the delivery room, every moment focused on the effort of bringing our three children into the world. With care and swift action from the medical team and with MC supporting me through every push, I fully embraced the labor. And after what felt like an eternity, our three babies—Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu—were born, their cries filling the room with new life. The doctors and nurses worked to ensure that the triplets and I were healthy, each baby being checked and wrapped in warm blankets before being placed in my arms. MC leaned down, tears in his eyes as he touched each of his newborns softly, overwhelmed with joy and awe at the miracle we had created. MC: “They’re perfect, Sayori. We did it. They're amazing.” Though the day was filled with uncertainty, panic, and intense pain, it ended with the three greatest gifts we could have ever hoped for. The literature club members, who had supported me through every step, were soon informed of the successful delivery and rejoiced at the good news.

But let’s not worry her just yet. Once MC is back with the water, we should talk it over with him first.” (MC returns with a glass of water and hands it to me.) MC: “Here you go, Sayori. Drink slowly. How are you feeling now?” Sayori: “A little better, thanks. The pillows help, and the water is refreshing.” (MC takes a seat beside me, holding my hand. He glances at Monika and Yuri with a look that suggests he’s seeking guidance. Just then, I felt a sudden warmth moving down my legs. Panic immediately set in - my water had just broken. The cramps I had been feeling were actually the onset of labor.) Sayori: (voice shaking) “MC, my water just broke.” (MC’s eyes widen with a mixture of surprise and concern.) MC: “Oh no. We need to get you to the hospital, fast!” (Monika immediately grabs her phone and starts dialing.) Monika: “I’m calling an ambulance right now.” Yuri: (visibly stressed but trying to stay composed) “Sayori, just try to relax and breathe. We’re here for you.” (The room fills with a sense of urgency. MC is by my side, holding my hand and speaking reassuring words, trying his best to keep me calm.) MC: “It’s going to be okay, Sayori. Just focus on breathing. We’re going to meet Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu very soon.” (Monika looks up from her phone.) Monika: “The ambulance will be here any minute. Sayori, can you stand with help, or do we need to carry you?” Sayori: “I think…I think I can stand if you help me.” (Two members of the literature club support me on either side as we slowly make our way to the front of the school to wait for the ambulance. My contractions are growing closer together, signaling that the babies are eager to arrive. And then…I could feel urge to push.) Sayori: (panting) “Oh gosh, I need to push…” MC: “Hold on, Sayori! Try not to push yet. The paramedics will be here soon, and they’ll help with everything.” (Monika is on the phone giving our location to the emergency dispatcher, updating on the situation, and Yuri is breathing in sync with me, trying to help me manage the contractions as I battle against the urge to push. There’s a clear sense of unity amongst everyone in the literature club as they work together to ensure both my safety and the safety of the babies.) Yuri: “Just keep taking deep breaths, Sayori. Focus on my voice. We’re all here with you.” (The minutes tick by slowly, and each second feels longer than the last. Everything was happening so fast. Just then, the pain became unbearable.

The sound of the siren gives everyone a glimmer of hope that medical help is about to arrive just in time.) Monika: “They're here! Everyone, help keep Sayori calm. The professionals will take it from here.” (The paramedics rush out of the ambulance with a stretcher, quickly assessing the situation. They are calm and efficient, providing both reassurance to Sayori and expert medical attention.) Paramedic #1: “Ma'am, I need you to try and stay calm. We're going to get you onto the stretcher and to the hospital as quickly as we can.” (The paramedics work together to carefully lift Sayori onto the stretcher, checking her vital signs and doing what they can to make her comfortable.) Paramedic #2: “She's fully dilated; we need to move now!” (The urgency is clear in the paramedic's voice as they wheel Sayori into the ambulance. MC climbs in alongside her, holding her hand tightly, his face etched with worry but also determination to be there for Sayori and their babies.) MC: “I'm here, Sayori. You're doing great. Just hang in there a little bit longer.” (The siren wails once more as the ambulance speeds towards the hospital, and the literature club members are left standing outside the school, their hearts racing with concern for Sayori and the unborn trio – Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu. Monika takes charge, directing the club's next steps.) Monika: “Okay, everyone. Let's gather our things and head to the hospital to be there for Sayori and MC. They'll need our support now more than ever. Yuri, can you help me collect our belongings?” Yuri: “Of course, Monika.” (The literature club members do as instructed, gathering quickly but quietly, a bond of friendship and concern enveloping them. They hope for the best, ready to support Sayori and MC through the stressful ordeal of an unexpected and precipitate labor.) (At the hospital, the scene is one of controlled chaos as doctors and nurses rush to prepare for an emergency childbirth. In the delivery room, Sayori is surrounded by a team of medical professionals, and MC remains steadfast by her side, cheering her on through every painful contraction.) MC: \\"You're incredible, Sayori. Just a little bit more, and we'll see them.\\" Amid the rush and the worry, Sayori clings to MC's hand, finding strength in his presence and the constant reminders of the joy that awaits them at the end of this ordeal. Despite the fear, there is anticipation and love – the little lives they're about to bring into the world are already deeply cherished. (During the labor, Sayori's focus is intense, her screams echo through the halls as she delivers the first of the three babies: Shinwa, swiftly followed by Jinsei, and then finally Desu. Each baby's arrival is met with cries that fill the room with life, intertwining with Sayori's exhausted but triumphant sobs. MC is overwhelmed with emotion, tears streaming down his face as he beholds their newborns for the first time.) Doctor: \\"You did it, Sayori. They're all here, and they're perfect.\\" (Sayori lies back, a mixture of exhaustion and pure elation washing over her. MC leans in to kiss her forehead, whispering words of love and admiration for the incredible strength she has shown through the tremendous ordeal of bringing their three children into the world.) Outside in the waiting room, the rest of the literature club waits anxiously for news. Their tight-knit community has been through so much together, and this moment is a testament to their collective resilience and compassion. When a nurse finally arrives to inform them that Sayori and the babies are all doing well, a mixture of relief and happiness bursts forth, and they can't wait to meet the newest additions to their extended family. The literature club knew that life, mythical as it may often seem, comes with its share of real trials and triumphs. And in this moment, they recognize the beauty and fragility of life itself, celebrating the miracle that is the birth of Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom…) Monika: “This is ridiculous! Natsuki should’ve been here by now!” MC: “I haven’t heard anything from her at all.” Yuri: “Maybe she just overslept or something?” (I couldn’t help but feel a sense of concern. Natsuki’s usually so punctual. I put a protective hand on my belly, feeling the movements of the three babies that MC and I would welcome into the world soon. We were naming them “Shinwa”, “Jinsei”, and “Desu” after the three spirit schools of the game “Wizard101” - Shinwa meaning “Myth”, Jinsei meaning “Life”, and Desu meaning “Death”. However, I was feeling some cramps at the time. It’s at this moment that Yuri notices me rubbing my belly.) Yuri: “Sayori, are you feeling alright? You seem to be in discomfort.” Sayori: “I’m okay, just some cramps. It’s probably nothing, but they’re more intense than usual.” MC: “Hey, maybe you should take it easy. You’re at a pretty advanced stage of your pregnancy, after all. Shall I get you some water or anything?” (MC gently puts a hand on mine as Jinsei - the most active of our babies - starts to kick.) Sayori: (smiling weakly) “Water would be nice, thank you, MC.” (MC rushes out of the room to get some water. Monika, meanwhile, seems caught between managing her concern for me and the absence of Natsuki.) Monika: “Okay everyone, let’s remain calm. We’ll reach out to Natsuki’s family to make sure she’s okay. In the meantime, let’s make sure Sayori is comfortable. Yuri, can you please help with that?” (Yuri nods and moves closer to me with a concerned look.) Yuri: “Is there a particular spot where we could make you more comfortable? Maybe we could get some pillows to support your back.” Sayori: “Some extra pillows would be really nice, Yuri. Thank you.” (Yuri quickly gathers some cushions from around the clubroom and arranges them on the couch for me to lean against. I take a seat and try to find a position that eases the cramping. The movements in my belly seem to calm down a little with the gentle pressure.) (Yuri now turns to Monika and speaks in a lower voice, hoping I wouldn’t overhear their concerned conversation.)

A sense of urgency flared through him as he looked at me, his eyes reflecting a mixture of concern, love, and an indescribable fear of the unknown. My breaths turned ragged, and the primal force of labor took over my body, my very being focused on the monumental task of bringing new life into the world. MC: \\"Sayori, I'm right here with you. Don't be afraid. We're going to do this together.\\" Monika's voice crackled with stress as she spoke into the phone, urging the dispatcher to send help as soon as possible. The tension was palpable in her voice, but with authoritative efficiency, she relayed every detail. Monika: \\"Please, you need to hurry. Our friend is in active labor and she can't hold the babies back any longer!\\" Yuri's calming presence was a stark contrast to the chaos. Her voice, soft and steady, continued to guide me through the breathing techniques we'd discussed in our many group meetings, preparing for this moment. She remained close, a comforting figure amidst the panic. Yuri: \\"Sayori, breathe with me. In... and out... You're incredibly strong. You can do this.\\" The front of the school came into view, as the others helped me slowly, carefully, but the contractions were coming faster now, leaving no room for caution. Each surge was stronger, more commanding than the last, and I knew that time was no longer our ally. And then, the sounds of sirens cut through the air, growing louder with each passing second, heralding the arrival of the much-needed help. Relief washed over everyone's face. Help was here. The paramedics, with their expertise and calm demeanor, burst onto the scene. They quickly assessed the situation, their professional gaze taking in my condition, the advanced stage of labor, and the urgency evident on my companions' faces. Paramedic: \\"We need to get her on the stretcher, now. Keep her calm and follow my lead. We're going to take care of you, ma'am.\\" With practiced movements, they eased me onto the stretcher, checking vitals and prepping for the possibility of delivering the babies right there or en route to the hospital. Everything became a blur as they loaded me into the ambulance, MC and Monika climbing in right after, while Yuri remained outside, sending silent prayers and words of encouragement. As the ambulance doors closed, MC held my hand firmly, a constant in the whirlwind of activity around us. His eyes looked deep into mine, offering a silent, unbreakable vow that he would be with me every step of the way, that nothing could pull him from my side. MC: \\"I love you, Sayori. I'll be here, no matter what.\\" The ambulance pulled away with sirens blaring, the paramedics working efficiently to prepare for the imminent arrival of the triplets.

We’re here for you.” (The room fills with a sense of urgency. MC is by my side, holding my hand and speaking reassuring words, trying his best to keep me calm.) MC: “It’s going to be okay, Sayori. Just focus on breathing. We’re going to meet Shinwa, Jinsei, and Desu very soon.” (Monika looks up from her phone.) Monika: “The ambulance will be here any minute. Sayori, can you stand with help, or do we need to carry you?” Sayori: “I think…I think I can stand if you help me.” (Two members of the literature club support me on either side as we slowly make our way to the front of the school to wait for the ambulance. My contractions are growing closer together, signaling that the babies are eager to arrive. And then…I could feel urge to push.) Sayori: (panting) “Oh gosh, I need to push…” MC: “Hold on, Sayori! Try not to push yet. The paramedics will be here soon, and they’ll help with everything.” (Monika is on the phone giving our location to the emergency dispatcher, updating on the situation, and Yuri is breathing in sync with me, trying to help me manage the contractions as I battle against the urge to push. There’s a clear sense of unity amongst everyone in the literature club as they work together to ensure both my safety and the safety of the babies.) Yuri: “Just keep taking deep breaths, Sayori. Focus on my voice. We’re all here with you.” (The minutes tick by slowly, and each second feels longer than the last. Everything was happening so fast. Just then, the pain became unbearable. Panic set in again - the urge to push was too strong. I couldn’t hold back any longer. This was it - the babies were coming now, whether we were ready or not. All I could do was scream as I pushed, unable to keep the babies inside my womb.)

Autrement dit, c'est la position qu'occupe un élément de la série lorsqu'on l'arrange par ordre croissant ou décroissant. Pour déterminer le rang d'une observation dans une série statistique, voici les étapes à suivre : 1. **Triez la série**: Arrangez toutes les observations de la série statistique en ordre croissant ou décroissant. Cela implique de les classer de la plus petite à la plus grande valeur ou inversement. 2. **Attribuez les rangs**: Commencez à attribuer les rangs en commençant par la première valeur triée. Donnez-lui le rang de 1, puis continuez en donnant à la valeur suivante le rang de 2, et ainsi de suite, jusqu'à atteindre la dernière valeur de la série. 3. **Gérez les égalités**: Si des valeurs identiques (appelées aussi des \\"ex-aequo\\") sont présentes dans la série, on leur attribue le rang moyen. Par exemple, si trois observations ont la même valeur et occupent les rangs 4, 5 et 6, chacune sera attribuée le rang (4+5+6)/3 = 5. Le rang est souvent utilisé dans le cadre de calculs statistiques, tels que la médiane (qui est la valeur qui se trouve au rang médian de la série ordonnée) ou dans des méthodes statistiques non paramétriques, comme le test des rangs signés de Wilcoxon."},{"prompt":"Оригинальный сюжет игры Ben and Ed: Игра “Ben and Ed” - это трехмерный платформер, где игрок управляет зомби по имени Эд, который должен преодолевать множество препятствий и ловушек, чтобы спасти своего лучшего друга, мальчика по имени Бен.

ALLEN (cautiously) Dr. Kaynes, your claims about “eternal life” sound too good to be true. What precautions are you taking to prevent unintended consequences? ED (making eye contact) We appreciate your questions. Safety is our priority - guiding each phase with care. MARIA joins Ed at the podium, her eyes shining with optimism. MARIA (supportively) Just imagine if more people could fulfill their life’s purpose. If we could give that gift of time - to nurture their dreams and strengthen bonds with loved ones. Thunderous applause erupts, though some still look uneasy. ED and MARIA stand united yet vulnerable, poised between revelatory success or devastating failure. An immense legacy hangs in the balance.

ED (takes his glass and gazes affectionately) Maria, love…your presence fills my world with joy. MARIA (smiles warmly, touching his arm) You support me through all the ups and downs. I couldn’t wish for a better partner than you. Maria turns on gentle music and pulls Ed close. MARIA (embraces him for a dance) Dance with me…? She lays her head on his shoulder, and they begin to slow dance. MARIA (eyes closed, lost in the moment) Just you and me before chaos erupts. Ed tightens his embrace, finding comfort in the closeness. ED (his voice soft, a whisper in her hair) Whatever comes, we’ll face it together. Maria looks up into Ed’s eyes, searching for reassurance. MARIA (a hint of worry) Our creation…have we erred? What if it destroys this city we love? Ed strokes her face, offering solace in his touch. ED (gazes deeply, with a reassuring softness) The future awaits, undefined. Each choice impacts what happens next. But know this… He pauses, his gaze warming. ED (LOVINGLY) No matter what happens, we have each other. He pulls her closer until their eyes are just inches apart. ED (softly) I love you, Maria… He kisses her tenderly. She returns his kiss, running her fingers through his hair. The music and lights gently fade as they get lost in each other’s embrace, their worries momentarily forgotten in the passion of this perfect moment together. END PAGE 4 OF 150 PAGE 5 OF 150 INT.

It is founded on the following premises: 1. **Demand**: This refers to the quantity of a product or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at various prices. Generally, at lower prices, more people are willing to buy a product (all else being equal), and as the price increases, the quantity demanded typically decreases. This relationship is graphically represented by a downward-sloping demand curve. 2. **Supply**: This refers to the quantity of a product or service that producers are willing and able to sell at different prices. Usually, at higher prices, producers are willing to supply more of a product because the potential for profit is better, and as the price decreases, the quantity supplied typically reduces as well. This relationship is represented by an upward-sloping supply curve. The point where the supply and demand curves intersect is referred to as the **equilibrium**. At the equilibrium price, the quantity of the product that consumers are willing to buy equals the quantity that producers are willing to sell. When market conditions are at equilibrium, the market is said to be at a state of balance, and there is no pressure for the price to change. **How Supply and Demand Impact Pricing:** - If **demand increases** (shifts to the right) and supply remains constant, the equilibrium price will increase, leading to higher prices. This might happen because of a rise in consumer preferences, an increase in income, an increase in population, or for other reasons. - If **demand decreases** (shifts to the left) and supply remains constant, the equilibrium price will decrease, leading to lower prices. - If **supply increases** (shifts to the right) and demand remains constant, the equilibrium price will decrease, leading to lower prices. This might occur due to technological improvements, reduction in production costs, or other factors that make production more efficient. - If **supply decreases** (shifts to the left) and demand remains constant, the equilibrium price will increase, leading to higher prices. When not at equilibrium, there can be either a surplus (quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded) or a shortage (quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied). In case of a surplus, producers might lower prices to clear the excess inventory, moving towards the equilibrium. In the case of a shortage, prices are likely to go up as consumers compete to purchase the limited goods available, again, moving towards equilibrium. It’s important to note that real-life markets may face various forms of frictions and may not always be in perfect equilibrium. Furthermore, numerous other factors, including government regulations, market power of producers or consumers, and externalities, can impact how supply and demand operate, and thus influence the pricing of goods and services in the market."},{"prompt":"Given the provided category and subcategory, choose the response that best answers the prompt.

According to Matthew and Mark, Jesus said that all foods are clean, but the Jewish Law clearly prohibits the consumption of pork! Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. (Matthew 15:11) \\"Are you so dull?\\" he asked. \\"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \\"clean.\\") He went on: \\"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' (Mark 7:18-20) Notice how the deceptive editors placed a note (in brackets) claiming that Jesus made all foods clean. This is clearly false, and Jesus never uttered these words. The Gospels were written under the influence of Paul, who rejected the Jewish Law (Hebrews 5:13, Galatians 3:13) The Gentile writers fabricated these words to make Jesus say that all foods are clean, thus supporting the Pauline doctrine. According to Matthew 5:17-20, Matthew 23:1-3, 23:23, Jesus came to preach the Jewish Law, and what does the Jewish Law say about eating pork? And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he [is] unclean to you. No Images or Hymns Available Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they [are] unclean to you. (Leviticus 11:7-8) And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it [is] unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase. No Images or Hymns Available These ye shall eat of all that [are] in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat: (Deu 14:8-9) The Bible prohibits the eating of pork. Jesus never made permissible the consumption of ‘all’ foods, it was a Pauline innovation by the Gospel writers. The Gnostic leader Marcion (d 140 CE) said that Jewish scribes were corrupting the Gospels by adding Jewish material into them. This proves that the four Gospels were originally composed by Gentile (pagan) writers. Jesus only ate kosher meat and was forbidden to eat pig’s flesh. Jesus said that he had come to uphold the law and not to destroy it one jot or one tithe. Jesus was educated in the synagogue in Jerusalem from the age of twelve. He preached in the synagogue. He used to keep the synagogue clean. No Christian today can be found performing these actions. How many Christians have been even been circumcised in the manner that Jesus was? The services now held in today’s churches were developed long after Jesus had disappeared. Many of them come directly from the pagan Graeco-Roman mythological rites. The prayers they use are not the prayers which Jesus made. The hymns they sing are not the praises which Jesus sung. Due to the innovations of Paul and his followers, there is no revealed teaching left as to what to eat and what not to eat. Anyone given a “Christian education” today eats what he feels like. Yet Jesus and his true followers only ate kosher meat and were forbidden to eat pig’s flesh”. (Jesus, Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, p. 199-200) The Gospels imply that eating pork is forbidden, since Jesus murdered over 2,000 pigs by drowning them in the sea, and he will destroy the pigs on his Second Coming. And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. (Matthew 8:32, Mark 5:13) Volume 3, Book 34, Number 425: Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, \\"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, son of Mary (Jesus) will shortly descend amongst you people (Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims ) as a just ruler and will break the Cross and kill the pig and abolish the Jizya (a tax taken from the non-Muslims, who are in the protection, of the Muslim government). Then there will be abundance of money and no-body will accept charitable gifts. (Sahih Bukhari) The Pauline authors did not stop there. The Jewish Law prohibits the consumption of wine (Leviticus 10:9, Proverbs 4:17, 20:1). Yet according to the Gospels, Jesus is made to drink wine, praise wine, and even transform water into wine! Do not drink wine nor strong drink (Leviticus 10:9) Wine [is] a mocker, strong drink [is] raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. (Proverbs 20:1) For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. (Proverbs 4:17) But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble [in] judgment. (Isaiah 28:7) Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. (Joel 1:5) Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. (Hosea 4:11) Jesus is made to praise wine: Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. (Matthew 9:17) Jesus is made to drink wine: Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. (Mark 14:25) Jesus is made to transform water into wine Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it]. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, (John 2:7-9) If the Gospels were written by the disciples of Jesus, then the miracle would have been reversed, the transforming of wine into water instead of water into wine. Jesus would never praise wine because it was the poison that caused Noah to get drunk, and Lot to commit incest! The Nazarenes and Ebionites followed the Jewish Law, they abstained from drinking wine. The Ebionites were stigmatized by the Church as heretics who failed to understand that Jesus was a divine person and asserted instead that he was a human being who came to inaugurate a new earthly age, as prophesied by the Jewish prophets of the Bible (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Moreover, the Ebionites refused to accept the Church doctrine, derived from Paul that Jesus abolished or abrogated the Torah, the Jewish law. Instead, the Ebionites observed the Jewish law and regarded themselves as Jews. The Ebionites were not heretics, as the Church asserted, nor 're-Judaizers', as modern scholars call them, but the authentic successors of the immediate disciples and followers of Jesus, whose views and doctrines they faithfully transmitted, believing correctly that they were derived from Jesus himself. They were the same group that had earlier been called the Nazarenes, who were led by James and Peter, who had known Jesus during his lifetime, and were in a far better position to know his aims than Paul, who met Jesus only in dreams and visions. Thus the opinion held by the Ebionites about Paul is of extraordinary interest and deserves respectful consideration, instead of dismissal as 'scurrilous' propaganda -- the reaction of Christian scholars from ancient to modern times. (Hyam Maccoby, The Myth Maker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity) During the Ascension of Prophet Muhammad to Heaven, he was given a choice between milk and wine. This event occurred before alcohol was prohibited. The Holy Prophet chose the milk: Book 001, Number 0309: It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. Then he took me to heaven… (Sahih Muslim) According to the Bible, the Prophet Noah got drunk! (God forbid) And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. (Genesis 9:20-25) Prophet Lot commits incest from wine (God forbid) Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. (Genesis 19:33-26) Although these stories are false because they teaches blasphemy against the holy Prophets Noah and Lot, they still convey a moral lesson for mankind that alcohol (wine) is the most dangerous substance that should be rejected by the true followers of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims are the true followers of Jesus because they practice his teachings, the abstinence from alcohol and the consumption of forbidden foods, and they observe fasting. The 12 disciples fasted after Jesus’ departure, and Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims obey their teachings whereas the “Christians” today neglect these laws. Islam, the Kingdom of God, forbids the consumption of alcohol, and purges the society from all social evils. Alcoholic drinks are the only poison that is licensed in many countries. However, Islam took a clear attitude towards alcoholic drinks more than 1400 years ago. Islam prohibits such drinks. Any drink that causes drunkenness is prohibited in Islam regardless of the matter it is made from and regardless of the quantity. According to Islam, if too much of a drink causes drunkenness, then any small quantity of this drink is prohibited, because all alcoholics start with small quantities, and then they become the slaves of alcohol. (Muhammad Ali Alkhuli, The Need For Islam, First Edition 1981, p. 71) This cocktail quality of Western civilization proves that the people of the West are not satisfied with the social structure or the values of their societies and that is why they keep inventing new social trends and ideologies. With this Western chaos of ideologies, how can the ordinary man find mental pace? (ibid, p. 41) Paul, the corrupter of the Gospel, made the drinking of wine permissible (1Timothy 5:23) and the Gospel writers reflected his teaching. Strangely, Paul mentions Noah but says nothing about how he got drunk; he blatantly ignored the story, and allowed the drinking of wine anyways. By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. (Hebrews 11:7) The Pauline Church persecuted the followers of Jesus until they became extinct. Now today, no Christian can be found observing the Jewish Law. Christians reject Judaism and accept the Old Testament simultaneously, and hypocritically quote from it. With the teaching by some, notably Paul, that the laws of the Jews need not to be followed by a Christian, contradictions began to arise between the body of newly-written Scriptures, which later became known as the “New Testament”, and the Old Testament. However, the Old Testament was retained by the established Church in spite of these contradictions, since an outright rejection of the Old Testament would have been regarded by many of the people as a rejection of Jesus himself. Confusion was the inevitable result. In the attempt to accept and reject the Old Testament simultaneously, contradictions arose within the New Testament itself, since it had to be “new” without openly rejecting the old. But, in the early days of the Church, there was no real attempt to formally arrange the books and ensure that all the accounts and doctrines tallied with each other. The leaders of the first Christian communities were free to use their discretion and to refer to those Scriptures which they thought best contained the teachings of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). (Muhammad Ataur-Raheem, Jesus Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, pp. 46) Jesus misquotes the Old Testament! The Gospels mention the story of how David ate bread “in the days of Abiathar” And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the House of GOD in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? (Mark 2:25-26) The passage is misquoting 1 Samuels 21:1-8, it never says David “ate the bread”, and it was during the time of Ahimleach and not Abiathar! According to Matthew 12:5, Jesus refers to the story of how priests “profaned the Sabbath”. Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? (12:5) There is no story of priests “profaning the Sabbath” in the Old Testament. Jesus used this mythical story as an excuse for breaking the Sabbath.","completion":"It seems like you are presenting an argument that challenges the traditional Christian interpretation of the Gospels, suggesting that Jesus adhered to Jewish Law and did not abolish dietary restrictions such as the prohibition of pork. You also reference theological assertions by Marcion, as well as concerns about the influence of Paul on early Christianity and its scriptures. In the passages you provided, there are several interpretations and notes that are critical of traditional Christian narratives. You also explore themes of the perceived conflict between Jesus' practices and the teachings attributed to him in the New Testament, as well as the relationship between early Jewish Christian sects like the Nazarenes and Ebionites and mainstream Christianity which eventually dominated. Additionally, you provide an Islamic perspective on Jesus, suggesting that Muslims are the true followers of Jesus's teachings based on the Quran and Hadith, contrasting Islamic practices regarding alcohol and diet with those of contemporary Christianity. It's important to note that this representation carries assumptions and interpretations that are highly controversial and debated among theologians and religious scholars. Historical and religious contexts are complex, and various religious traditions interpret scriptures and religious events very differently. Due to the length and complexity of the text you provided, and the numerous points it makes, a full reformatting of the content would require distilling each main point into a structured outline, potentially with sub-points or explanations as necessary. Given the space constraints here, I'll start by summarizing the main points you seem to be trying to make: 1. **Gospel Narrative and Dietary Laws**: The Gospels are interpreted to show that Jesus broke Jewish dietary laws by declaring all foods clean, but this is viewed as a Pauline influence contrary to Jewish Law and Jesus’ actual practice. 2. **Jesus and Torah**: It's argued that Jesus preached adherence to Jewish Law, contrasting with portrayals in the Gospels that suggest Jesus made all foods permissible. 3. **Marcion’s Belief**: Marcion claimed that Jewish scribes were distorting the Gospels, suggesting the original texts were composed by Gentile authors and later corrupted. 4. **Critique of Gospel Authors**: It's suggested that the Gospel writers fabricated sayings of Jesus about food and drink to align with Pauline theology, which differed from Jesus’ supposed true teachings. 5. **Early Christian Sects - Nazarenes and Ebionites**: These Jewish Christian groups are portrayed as the true successors of Jesus' teachings, in contrast to Pauline Christianity, emphasizing their adherence to Jewish Law. 6. **Alcohol in Christian and Islamic Teachings**: While Paul and later Christian traditions are said to permit wine, the Islamic tradition strictly prohibits alcohol, considering it harmful, and presents an account wherein Prophet Muhammad chooses milk over wine. 7. **Biblical Prophets and Alcohol**: Accounts in Genesis concerning Noah and Lot are described as negative examples regarding the effects of wine, but are also labelled as potentially blasphemous fabrications. 8. **The True Followers of Jesus**: The argument here is that Muslims more closely follow Jesus' teachings, particularly regarding the abstention from alcohol and observance of dietary laws. 9. **Critique of Pauline Influence**: The expansion of the early Church under Paul’s teachings is seen as a departure from the original message of Jesus, leading to a rejection of the Jewish Law within Christianity. 10. **Jesus’ Alleged Misquoting of the Old Testament**: Two examples from the Gospels are cited where Jesus is said to misquote or misrepresent events from the Old Testament, which is argued to further demonstrate inconsistencies or errors within the New Testament. For a detailed reformatting, each of these points could be expanded upon with additional context and supporting information, but that would go beyond the scope of this response. The general intent seems to be to critique the traditional Christian narrative of Jesus' teachings and to present both an Islamic perspective and a historical-critical perspective on early Christianity."},{"prompt":"reword this: The Gospels show Jesus breaking the laws of the Torah. According to Matthew and Mark, Jesus said that all foods are clean, but the Jewish Law clearly prohibits the consumption of pork! Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. (Matthew 15:11) \\"Are you so dull?\\" he asked. \\"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \\"clean.\\") He went on: \\"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' (Mark 7:18-20) Notice how the deceptive editors placed a note (in brackets) claiming that Jesus made all foods clean. This is clearly false, and Jesus never uttered these words. The Gospels were written under the influence of Paul, who rejected the Jewish Law (Hebrews 5:13, Galatians 3:13) The Gentile writers fabricated these words to make Jesus say that all foods are clean, thus supporting the Pauline doctrine. According to Matthew 5:17-20, Matthew 23:1-3, 23:23, Jesus came to preach the Jewish Law, and what does the Jewish Law say about eating pork? And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he [is] unclean to you. Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they [are] unclean to you. (Leviticus 11:7-8) And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it [is] unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase. These ye shall eat of all that [are] in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat: (Deu 14:8-9) The Bible prohibits the eating of pork. Jesus never made permissible the consumption of ‘all’ foods, it was a Pauline innovation by the Gospel writers. The Gnostic leader Marcion (d 140 CE) said that Jewish scribes were corrupting the Gospels by adding Jewish material into them. This proves that the four Gospels were originally composed by Gentile (pagan) writers. Jesus only ate kosher meat and was forbidden to eat pig’s flesh. Jesus said that he had come to uphold the law and not to destroy it one jot or one tithe. Jesus was educated in the synagogue in Jerusalem from the age of twelve. He preached in the synagogue. He used to keep the synagogue clean. No Christian today can be found performing these actions. How many Christians have been even been circumcised in the manner that Jesus was? The services now held in today’s churches were developed long after Jesus had disappeared. Many of them come directly from the pagan Graeco-Roman mythological rites. The prayers they use are not the prayers which Jesus made. The hymns they sing are not the praises which Jesus sung. Due to the innovations of Paul and his followers, there is no revealed teaching left as to what to eat and what not to eat. Anyone given a “Christian education” today eats what he feels like. Yet Jesus and his true followers only ate kosher meat and were forbidden to eat pig’s flesh”. (Jesus, Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, p. 199-200) The Gospels imply that eating pork is forbidden, since Jesus murdered over 2,000 pigs by drowning them in the sea, and he will destroy the pigs on his Second Coming. And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. (Matthew 8:32, Mark 5:13) Volume 3, Book 34, Number 425: Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, \\"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, son of Mary (Jesus) will shortly descend amongst you people (Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims ) as a just ruler and will break the Cross and kill the pig and abolish the Jizya (a tax taken from the non-Muslims, who are in the protection, of the Muslim government). Then there will be abundance of money and no-body will accept charitable gifts. (Sahih Bukhari) The Pauline authors did not stop there. The Jewish Law prohibits the consumption of wine (Leviticus 10:9, Proverbs 4:17, 20:1). Yet according to the Gospels, Jesus is made to drink wine, praise wine, and even transform water into wine! Do not drink wine nor strong drink (Leviticus 10:9) Wine [is] a mocker, strong drink [is] raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. (Proverbs 20:1) For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. (Proverbs 4:17) But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble [in] judgment. (Isaiah 28:7) Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. (Joel 1:5) Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. (Hosea 4:11) Jesus is made to praise wine: Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. (Matthew 9:17) Jesus is made to drink wine: Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. (Mark 14:25) Jesus is made to transform water into wine Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it]. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, (John 2:7-9) If the Gospels were written by the disciples of Jesus, then the miracle would have been reversed, the transforming of wine into water instead of water into wine. Jesus would never praise wine because it was the poison that caused Noah to get drunk, and Lot to commit incest! The Nazarenes and Ebionites followed the Jewish Law, they abstained from drinking wine. The Ebionites were stigmatized by the Church as heretics who failed to understand that Jesus was a divine person and asserted instead that he was a human being who came to inaugurate a new earthly age, as prophesied by the Jewish prophets of the Bible (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Moreover, the Ebionites refused to accept the Church doctrine, derived from Paul that Jesus abolished or abrogated the Torah, the Jewish law. Instead, the Ebionites observed the Jewish law and regarded themselves as Jews. The Ebionites were not heretics, as the Church asserted, nor 're-Judaizers', as modern scholars call them, but the authentic successors of the immediate disciples and followers of Jesus, whose views and doctrines they faithfully transmitted, believing correctly that they were derived from Jesus himself. They were the same group that had earlier been called the Nazarenes, who were led by James and Peter, who had known Jesus during his lifetime, and were in a far better position to know his aims than Paul, who met Jesus only in dreams and visions. Thus the opinion held by the Ebionites about Paul is of extraordinary interest and deserves respectful consideration, instead of dismissal as 'scurrilous' propaganda -- the reaction of Christian scholars from ancient to modern times. (Hyam Maccoby, The Myth Maker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity) During the Ascension of Prophet Muhammad to Heaven, he was given a choice between milk and wine. This event occurred before alcohol was prohibited. The Holy Prophet chose the milk: Book 001, Number 0309: It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. Then he took me to heaven… (Sahih Muslim) According to the Bible, the Prophet Noah got drunk! (God forbid) And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. (Genesis 9:20-25) Prophet Lot commits incest from wine (God forbid) Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. (Genesis 19:33-26) Although these stories are false because they teaches blasphemy against the holy Prophets Noah and Lot, they still convey a moral lesson for mankind that alcohol (wine) is the most dangerous substance that should be rejected by the true followers of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him).

Jesus used this mythical story as an excuse for breaking the Sabbath.","completion":"The Gospels depict Jesus as challenging Torah laws. In the books of Matthew and Mark, Jesus is quoted suggesting the cleanliness of all foods, which contrasts with the Torah's explicit ban on eating pork. \\"Nothing entering a person from the outside can defile them; but the things that come out of a person's mouth can defile them.\\" (Matthew 15:11) \\"Why are you so dull?\\" he asked. \\"Don't you see that whatever enters a person from the outside cannot defile them because it doesn't go into their heart but into their stomach, and then out of the body?\\" (In asserting this, Jesus is interpreted as having declared all foods clean.) Then he added, \\"It's what emerges from a person that defiles them.\\" (Mark 7:18-20) The Gospels contain editorial notes suggesting Jesus declared all foods permissible, which some claim to be a false representation. The Gospels' alignment with Paul's stance, who distanced himself from Jewish law, reinforces this view. The text challenges the notion that Jesus abrogated dietary laws by indicating that he taught and practiced adherence to Jewish law, and kosher laws prohibit pork. The Gospels suggest that consumption of pork is against the teachings of Jesus, as evidenced by a narrative where he caused a herd of pigs to drown. Moreover, Islamic tradition foretells that Jesus will destroy pigs upon his return. According to the narration, Jesus was faithful to Jewish Law and traditions, preserving the sanctity of the synagogue and adhering strictly to kosher dietary rules, in contrast to the teachings developed after his time which diverged from these practices. Critics argue that Jesus, as presented in the Gospels, wrongly attributes his own teachings to the Old Testament. For example, he cites David eating the consecrated bread during the time of Abiathar, the high priest, and the supposed instance of priests profaning the Sabbath, neither of which accurately reflects the Old Testament records. This interpretation highlights the continuous evolution of religious text and practice since the earliest days of Christianity, with the influence of figures like Paul leading to divergences from what some argue were the original teachings of Jesus."},{"prompt":"reword this: The Gospels show Jesus breaking the laws of the Torah.

Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. Then he took me to heaven… (Sahih Muslim) According to the Bible, the Prophet Noah got drunk! (God forbid) And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. (Genesis 9:20-25) Prophet Lot commits incest from wine (God forbid) Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. (Genesis 19:33-26) Although these stories are false because they teaches blasphemy against the holy Prophets Noah and Lot, they still convey a moral lesson for mankind that alcohol (wine) is the most dangerous substance that should be rejected by the true followers of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims are the true followers of Jesus because they practice his teachings, the abstinence from alcohol and the consumption of forbidden foods, and they observe fasting. The 12 disciples fasted after Jesus’ departure, and Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims obey their teachings whereas the “Christians” today neglect these laws. Islam, the Kingdom of God, forbids the consumption of alcohol, and purges the society from all social evils. Alcoholic drinks are the only poison that is licensed in many countries. However, Islam took a clear attitude towards alcoholic drinks more than 1400 years ago. Islam prohibits such drinks. Any drink that causes drunkenness is prohibited in Islam regardless of the matter it is made from and regardless of the quantity. According to Islam, if too much of a drink causes drunkenness, then any small quantity of this drink is prohibited, because all alcoholics start with small quantities, and then they become the slaves of alcohol. (Muhammad Ali Alkhuli, The Need For Islam, First Edition 1981, p. 71) This cocktail quality of Western civilization proves that the people of the West are not satisfied with the social structure or the values of their societies and that is why they keep inventing new social trends and ideologies. With this Western chaos of ideologies, how can the ordinary man find mental pace? (ibid, p. 41) Paul, the corrupter of the Gospel, made the drinking of wine permissible (1Timothy 5:23) and the Gospel writers reflected his teaching. Strangely, Paul mentions Noah but says nothing about how he got drunk; he blatantly ignored the story, and allowed the drinking of wine anyways. By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. (Hebrews 11:7) The Pauline Church persecuted the followers of Jesus until they became extinct. Now today, no Christian can be found observing the Jewish Law. Christians reject Judaism and accept the Old Testament simultaneously, and hypocritically quote from it. With the teaching by some, notably Paul, that the laws of the Jews need not to be followed by a Christian, contradictions began to arise between the body of newly-written Scriptures, which later became known as the “New Testament”, and the Old Testament. However, the Old Testament was retained by the established Church in spite of these contradictions, since an outright rejection of the Old Testament would have been regarded by many of the people as a rejection of Jesus himself. Confusion was the inevitable result. In the attempt to accept and reject the Old Testament simultaneously, contradictions arose within the New Testament itself, since it had to be “new” without openly rejecting the old. But, in the early days of the Church, there was no real attempt to formally arrange the books and ensure that all the accounts and doctrines tallied with each other. The leaders of the first Christian communities were free to use their discretion and to refer to those Scriptures which they thought best contained the teachings of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). (Muhammad Ataur-Raheem, Jesus Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, pp. 46) Jesus misquotes the Old Testament! The Gospels mention the story of how David ate bread “in the days of Abiathar” And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the House of GOD in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? (Mark 2:25-26) The passage is misquoting 1 Samuels 21:1-8, it never says David “ate the bread”, and it was during the time of Ahimleach and not Abiathar! According to Matthew 12:5, Jesus refers to the story of how priests “profaned the Sabbath”. Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? (12:5) There is no story of priests “profaning the Sabbath” in the Old Testament. Jesus used this mythical story as an excuse for breaking the Sabbath.","completion":"The Gospels present Jesus as acting contrary to Torah restrictions. Specifically, texts from Matthew and Mark attribute to Jesus the statement that no foods are intrinsically impure, a claim at odds with the Torah's specific ban on pork consumption. \\"What doesn't enter the mouth can't defile a person; rather, what exits the mouth can cause defilement.\\" (Matthew 15:11) \\"Do you not understand?\\" Jesus questioned. \\"Can't you grasp that nothing from the outside entering a person has the power to defile, as it goes not to the heart but the stomach, and is excreted?\\" (By saying this, Jesus seemed to designate all foods as permissible.) Continuing, he said, \\"It's the output of a person that contaminates them.\\" (Mark 7:18-20) Editors have inserted annotations interpreting these words as Jesus having declared all foods clean; critics assert this is a misrepresentation and not Jesus' original message. The Gospels' content is claimed to have been influenced by Paul's rejection of Jewish Law. Allegedly, Gentile authors manipulating the text made it seem as though Jesus endorsed all foods as pure, thereby aligning his supposed teachings with those of Paul. Yet according to other passages in Matthew, Jesus upheld the Jewish Law, which clearly outlines dietary restrictions on pork: \\"Pigs, though they have divided hooves, do not chew the cud and are unclean for you. Their meat you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall not touch; they are unclean for you.\\" (Leviticus 11:7-8) \\"Pigs, because they divide the hoof yet do not chew the cud, are unclean for you; you must not consume their meat or touch their dead bodies.\\" (Deuteronomy 14:8-9) The scriptural texts proscribe pork. It is posited that Jesus never allowed the eating of 'all' foods, with this idea supposedly originating from the authors of the Gospel who were under Pauline influence. Gnostic Marcion, around 140 CE, accused Jewish scholars of altering the Gospels by incorporating Jewish elements. This accusation is interpreted as evidence that the Gospels were initially penned by non-Jewish authors and were subsequently modified. Jesus adhered to kosher diet regulations, avoiding pork as per Jewish Law. He emphasized the importance of upholding the law, was educated and active within the Jewish synagogue, and lived according to Jewish customs. Modern Christian practices, seen as divergent from these traditions and influenced by Paul's teachings, lack adherence to these specific dietary guidelines. The Gospel narratives even imply prohibition against pork through an episode where Jesus causes a herd of pigs to drown, and Islamic tradition predicts he will destroy pigs upon his return. Besides the assertion of biblical misinterpretations, the narrative also emphasizes that Islamic tradition prohibits alcohol, contrasting with Pauline allowances for wine consumption in the Gospels, despite Jewish Law's prohibitions. Islamic scriptures also present the Prophet Muhammad's preference for milk over wine, reinforcing the argument against alcohol. Critics argue that Jesus' followers, the Nazarenes and Ebionites, who upheld Jewish Law and anticipated a messianic earthly reign, have been historically marginalized by the Church for their non-conformity to emerging Christian doctrines influenced by Paul. Moreover, narratives of scriptural inconsistencies are underscored by examples where Jesus is said to misrepresent Old Testament events, including the accounts of David eating consecrated bread and priests allegedly desecrating the Sabbath, neither of which align with the Old Testament records. This critique extends to underlying contradictions within Christian scriptures due to influences that urged a departure from Jewish Law, resulting in the unlikely coexistence of the Old and New Testaments within the Christian canon. The discussion implores consideration and critical analysis of religious history, the formation of scriptures, and the evolution of doctrinal teachings within Christianity and its divergence from the practices of Jesus as maintained in Islamic tradition."},{"prompt":"reformat this: The Gospels show Jesus breaking the laws of the Torah. According to Matthew and Mark, Jesus said that all foods are clean, but the Jewish Law clearly prohibits the consumption of pork! Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. (Matthew 15:11) \\"Are you so dull?\\" he asked. \\"Don't you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him 'unclean'? For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and then out of his body.\\" (In saying this, Jesus declared all foods \\"clean.\\") He went on: \\"What comes out of a man is what makes him 'unclean.' (Mark 7:18-20) Notice how the deceptive editors placed a note (in brackets) claiming that Jesus made all foods clean. This is clearly false, and Jesus never uttered these words. The Gospels were written under the influence of Paul, who rejected the Jewish Law (Hebrews 5:13, Galatians 3:13) The Gentile writers fabricated these words to make Jesus say that all foods are clean, thus supporting the Pauline doctrine. According to Matthew 5:17-20, Matthew 23:1-3, 23:23, Jesus came to preach the Jewish Law, and what does the Jewish Law say about eating pork? And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he [is] unclean to you. Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they [are] unclean to you. (Leviticus 11:7-8) And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it [is] unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase. These ye shall eat of all that [are] in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat: (Deu 14:8-9) The Bible prohibits the eating of pork. Jesus never made permissible the consumption of ‘all’ foods, it was a Pauline innovation by the Gospel writers. The Gnostic leader Marcion (d 140 CE) said that Jewish scribes were corrupting the Gospels by adding Jewish material into them. This proves that the four Gospels were originally composed by Gentile (pagan) writers. Jesus only ate kosher meat and was forbidden to eat pig’s flesh. Jesus said that he had come to uphold the law and not to destroy it one jot or one tithe. Jesus was educated in the synagogue in Jerusalem from the age of twelve. He preached in the synagogue. He used to keep the synagogue clean. No Christian today can be found performing these actions. How many Christians have been even been circumcised in the manner that Jesus was? The services now held in today’s churches were developed long after Jesus had disappeared. Many of them come directly from the pagan Graeco-Roman mythological rites. The prayers they use are not the prayers which Jesus made. The hymns they sing are not the praises which Jesus sung. Due to the innovations of Paul and his followers, there is no revealed teaching left as to what to eat and what not to eat. Anyone given a “Christian education” today eats what he feels like. Yet Jesus and his true followers only ate kosher meat and were forbidden to eat pig’s flesh”. (Jesus, Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, p. 199-200) The Gospels imply that eating pork is forbidden, since Jesus murdered over 2,000 pigs by drowning them in the sea, and he will destroy the pigs on his Second Coming. And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. (Matthew 8:32, Mark 5:13) Volume 3, Book 34, Number 425: Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, \\"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, son of Mary (Jesus) will shortly descend amongst you people (Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims ) as a just ruler and will break the Cross and kill the pig and abolish the Jizya (a tax taken from the non-Muslims, who are in the protection, of the Muslim government). Then there will be abundance of money and no-body will accept charitable gifts. (Sahih Bukhari) The Pauline authors did not stop there. The Jewish Law prohibits the consumption of wine (Leviticus 10:9, Proverbs 4:17, 20:1). Yet according to the Gospels, Jesus is made to drink wine, praise wine, and even transform water into wine! Do not drink wine nor strong drink (Leviticus 10:9) Wine [is] a mocker, strong drink [is] raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. (Proverbs 20:1) For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. (Proverbs 4:17) But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble [in] judgment. (Isaiah 28:7) Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. (Joel 1:5) Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. (Hosea 4:11) Jesus is made to praise wine: Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. (Matthew 9:17) Jesus is made to drink wine: Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. (Mark 14:25) Jesus is made to transform water into wine Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it]. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, (John 2:7-9) If the Gospels were written by the disciples of Jesus, then the miracle would have been reversed, the transforming of wine into water instead of water into wine. Jesus would never praise wine because it was the poison that caused Noah to get drunk, and Lot to commit incest! The Nazarenes and Ebionites followed the Jewish Law, they abstained from drinking wine. The Ebionites were stigmatized by the Church as heretics who failed to understand that Jesus was a divine person and asserted instead that he was a human being who came to inaugurate a new earthly age, as prophesied by the Jewish prophets of the Bible (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Moreover, the Ebionites refused to accept the Church doctrine, derived from Paul that Jesus abolished or abrogated the Torah, the Jewish law. Instead, the Ebionites observed the Jewish law and regarded themselves as Jews. The Ebionites were not heretics, as the Church asserted, nor 're-Judaizers', as modern scholars call them, but the authentic successors of the immediate disciples and followers of Jesus, whose views and doctrines they faithfully transmitted, believing correctly that they were derived from Jesus himself. They were the same group that had earlier been called the Nazarenes, who were led by James and Peter, who had known Jesus during his lifetime, and were in a far better position to know his aims than Paul, who met Jesus only in dreams and visions. Thus the opinion held by the Ebionites about Paul is of extraordinary interest and deserves respectful consideration, instead of dismissal as 'scurrilous' propaganda -- the reaction of Christian scholars from ancient to modern times. (Hyam Maccoby, The Myth Maker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity) During the Ascension of Prophet Muhammad to Heaven, he was given a choice between milk and wine. This event occurred before alcohol was prohibited. The Holy Prophet chose the milk: Book 001, Number 0309: It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. Then he took me to heaven… (Sahih Muslim) According to the Bible, the Prophet Noah got drunk! (God forbid) And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. (Genesis 9:20-25) Prophet Lot commits incest from wine (God forbid) Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. (Genesis 19:33-26) Although these stories are false because they teaches blasphemy against the holy Prophets Noah and Lot, they still convey a moral lesson for mankind that alcohol (wine) is the most dangerous substance that should be rejected by the true followers of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him).","completion":"In the Gospels, there are passages which suggest that Jesus did not abide by certain Torah laws. Notably, the books of Matthew and Mark quote Jesus as asserting the purity of all foods, directly contradicting the dietary restrictions outlined in Jewish Law, especially the prohibition on pork. Matthew cites Jesus as saying, \\"It's not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of it.\\" (Matthew 15:11) Similarly, Mark recounts a discussion where Jesus challenged prevailing notions of dietary impurity: \\"Are you unable to comprehend?\\" queried Jesus. \\"Surely you realize that nothing external can defile a person since it does not affect the heart but merely passes through the digestive process?\\" It is suggested that by these words, Jesus deemed all foodstuffs devoid of impurity. The discourse concludes with the proclamation, \\"It is the emanations from a person that render them impure.\\" (Mark 7:18-20) However, annotations added by editors imply Jesus sanctioned all foods, which some argue is a misleading fabrication; they contend Jesus' actual remarks never included such declarations. Critics maintain that Paul's influence, who openly dismissed Jewish Law, is reflected in the Gospels. Nonetheless, the Gospel authors are accused of altering Jesus' words to support the view that all foods are clean, resonating with Paul's teachings. Yet, in other Gospel sections, Jesus is portrayed as a proponent of Jewish Law, which categorically classifies pork as unclean. Leviticus states, \\"Though pigs have divided hooves, they do not ruminate and are thus unclean to you. Their meat you must not consume; their carcasses you must not touch; they are unclean.\\" (Leviticus 11:7-8) Similarly, Deuteronomy concurs, stating, \\"While pigs have divided hooves, they do not ruminate and are therefore unclean to you; you are forbidden from eating their meat or touching their dead bodies. However, you may consume all aquatic creatures that have fins and scales.\\" (Deuteronomy 14:8-9) The scriptural evidence affirms the ban on pork consumption. The claim is that Jesus' supposed declaration that 'all' foods were permissible did not originate from Him but was a later innovation by the Gospel writers inspired by Paul. Furthermore, the Gnostic leader Marcion (died 140 CE) accused the Jewish scribes of corrupting the Gospels by embedding Jewish traditions into them, which serves for some as proof that the original Gospels were authored by non-Jews. Jesus, who strictly followed Jewish dietary laws, consumed only kosher meat and refrained from pork. He stated that his mission was not to overturn the law but to fulfill it. From his early years, Jesus was immersed in the teachings of the synagogue, and his practices were firmly rooted in Jewish tradition. These traditions are in contrast to modern Christian practices, which have evolved and, in many cases, diverged from their origins, due in part to Paul's influence. Notably, the Gospels insinuate the prohibition of pork consumption, referencing a narrative where Jesus caused a mass drowning of pigs, with an Islamic prophecy foretelling that He will annihilate pigs upon His forthcoming return. Additionally, the Gospel accounts describe Jesus as participating in activities involving wine—for example, drinking, appreciating, and even miraculously converting water into wine—which stands in contrast to Jewish Law which forbids wine consumption: \\"Do not drink wine nor strong drink.\\" (Leviticus 10:9) \\"Wine is a mocker, strong drink is rowdy; anyone deceived by them lacks wisdom.\\" (Proverbs 20:1) \\"They consume the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of brutality.\\" (Proverbs 4:17) \\"They have strayed due to wine; they have veered off course with strong drink.\\" (Isaiah 28:7) \\"Rouse yourselves, drunkards, and weep; wail, all you wine-drinkers.\\" (Joel 1:5) \\"Pleasure-seeking and wine, together with new wine, deprive people of their hearts.\\" (Hosea 4:11) There are also passages where Jesus is attributed with praise for wine: \\"Nor do people put new wine into old wineskins, lest the skins burst, spilling the wine and ruining the skins.\\" (Matthew 9:17) Jesus is depicted partaking in wine consumption: \\"I assure you, from now on, I will not taste the fruit of the vine until the day I drink it anew in the realm of God.\\" (Mark 14:25) A famous account concerns Jesus transforming water into wine: \\"Jesus directed them to fill the jars with water, and they filled them to the brim. Then he instructed them to draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.\\" (John 2:7-9) Such narratives underscore the contention that if the Gospels had been penned by Jesus' immediate disciples, the tales might have depicted a figure aligned with abstention from wine in alignment with sacred precedent, and not one who performs feats such as turning water into wine. Minority Christian sects like the Nazarenes and Ebionites maintained Jewish Law, including abstinence from wine. Despite the Church branding them as heretical, they saw themselves as the rightful bearers of Jesus' legacy. When the Prophet Muhammad ascended to Heaven, he was presented with a choice between wine and milk, selecting the latter, denoting the preference for the natural over the intoxicating before alcohol was prohibited by Islam. Contrary though are Biblical accounts of prophets compromised by wine, with Noah becoming intoxicated from his own vineyard's yield and the daughters of Lot engaging in acts of incest under the influence of wine, despite the argument that such narratives are not true due to their derogatory nature toward prophets. In summary, the portrayal of Jesus in the Gospels, particularly regarding the nullification of dietary laws and the acceptance of wine, raises questions of authenticity and scriptural continuity, highlighting the complex evolution of religious teachings and practices."},{"prompt":"give me a list where Jesus broke the laws","completion":"There are several instances recorded in the New Testament Gospels where Jesus is depicted as violating or reinterpreting Jewish laws and customs of His time. Here's a list of some notable examples: 1. **Sabbath Controversies**: - Jesus heals the sick on the Sabbath, such as a man with a withered hand (Matthew 12:9-14) and a woman crippled by a spirit (Luke 13:10-17). - Jesus allows His disciples to pick grain on the Sabbath (Mark 2:23-28). 2. **Ritual Purity Laws**: - Jesus touches and heals lepers (Matthew 8:1-4), which would have made him ceremonially unclean according to Jewish law. - He interacts with the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5:25-34), whose touch would have also conveyed impurity. 3. **Eating with Sinners and Tax Collectors**: - Jesus dines with tax collectors and sinners (Mark 2:15-17), which was frowned upon by Pharisees and seen as associating with the unrighteous. 4. **Dietary Laws**: - Peter’s vision in Acts reflects back on the teachings of Jesus, leading to the interpretation that all foods were declared clean (Acts 10:10-16), which was a deviation from kosher dietary laws. 5. **Ceremonial Hand Washing**: - Jesus challenges the Pharisees on the tradition of hand washing before eating (Matthew 15:1-20) and declares that what comes out of a person’s mouth defiles them rather than what goes in. 6. **Associating with Gentiles and Non-Jews**: - He interacts and offers salvation to the Samaritan woman (John 4:7-30) and a Roman centurion (Matthew 8:5-13), which would have been controversial among Jews who avoided such associations. 7. **Cursing the Fig Tree**: - Jesus curses a fig tree, which has been interpreted by some as a violation of Jewish principles stewards of the earth (Mark 11:12-25). 8. **Temple Incident**: - He overturns the tables of the money changers and clears the Temple (Matthew 21:12-13), which could be seen as a disregard for the authority and practices of the Temple institution. It is important to note that these actions by Jesus are often subject to interpretation and theological debate. In the Gospel accounts, Jesus’s actions were interpreted as signs of His messianic authority and His new interpretation of the Law. In most cases, Jesus did not break the written Torah (the law of Moses as found in the first five books of the Hebrew Bible) but rather challenged the additional oral laws and traditions upheld by the Pharisees. His teachings and actions often focused on the spirit of the law rather than the letter, prioritizing mercy, compassion, and the love of God."},{"prompt":"give me more","completion":"In addition to the examples already provided, here are more instances that can be interpreted as Jesus either breaking or significantly reinterpreting Jewish laws and traditions, according to the New Testament: 1. **Interacting with the Dead**: - Jesus touches a coffin to resurrect a widow's son, which under Jewish law would render him unclean (Luke 7:11-17). 2. **The Transfiguration**: - During the Transfiguration, Jesus speaks with Moses and Elijah, which could be perceived as consulting with the dead, a practice forbidden in Deuteronomy 18:10-12 (Matthew 17:1-9). 3. **Forgiveness of Sins**: - Jesus forgives people’s sins, such as the paralyzed man (Mark 2:5), which some religious authorities of the time saw as a blasphemy, as forgiveness of sins was considered God's prerogative. 4. **Touching a Menstruating Woman**: - The woman with the issue of blood who touched Jesus would have been considered ritually unclean, and by Old Testament law, anyone she touched would become unclean as well (Mark 5:25-34). 5. **Defying Temple Tax**: - Jesus instructs Peter to find a coin in a fish's mouth to pay the Temple tax, a method that seems to underplay the seriousness of Temple tax adherence (Matthew 17:24-27). 6. **Healing on the Sabbath**: - Jesus heals a man born blind on the Sabbath, which Pharisees considered a violation of Sabbath law (John 9:1-16). 7. **Proclaiming a New Covenant**: - At the Last Supper, Jesus speaks of his blood as the \\"new covenant,\\" which suggests the replacement or fulfillment of the old covenant, a concept that was radical at the time (Luke 22:20). 8. **Failing to Observe Fasts**: - Unlike John the Baptist's disciples and the Pharisees, Jesus and his disciples do not fast, prompting questions and criticism from religious leaders (Matthew 9:14-17). 9. **Association with women**: - Jesus spoke directly with women in public, taught them, and had female followers, which broke social customs of the time (John 4:27; Luke 10:38-42; Mark 15:40-41). 10. **Allowing a Woman to Anoint Him**: - A woman anoints Jesus with expensive perfume in preparation for his burial. By allowing a woman to touch him in such an intimate way, Jesus flouted contemporary norms (John 12:1-8). 11. **Predicting the Destruction of the Temple**: - Jesus spoke about the destruction of the Temple and its rebuilding in three days, a statement seen as blasphemous and seditious by the Jewish authorities, contributing to the charges against him (John 2:19-21). 12. **Parables of New Practices**: - Jesus teaches through parables, such as the Parable of the New Wine in Old Wineskins, suggesting the incompatibility of his new teachings with old practices (Luke 5:36-39). 13. **Rebuking Pharisees and Teachers of the Law**: - Jesus condemns the scribes and Pharisees, calling them hypocrites and ignoring their additional laws, which they added to the Torah (Matthew 23). These instances illustrate how Jesus' actions and words often challenged the formal religious interpretations and practices of His time. They are seen within Christian theology as part of Jesus' mission to establish a new covenantal relationship between God and humanity, centered on love, mercy, and internal transformation, rather than mere outward ritual compliance."},{"prompt":"rewrite this: The Gospels show Jesus breaking the laws of the Torah.

The Gospels were written under the influence of Paul, who rejected the Jewish Law (Hebrews 5:13, Galatians 3:13) The Gentile writers fabricated these words to make Jesus say that all foods are clean, thus supporting the Pauline doctrine. According to Matthew 5:17-20, Matthew 23:1-3, 23:23, Jesus came to preach the Jewish Law, and what does the Jewish Law say about eating pork? And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he cheweth not the cud; he [is] unclean to you. No Images or Hymns Available Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch; they [are] unclean to you. (Leviticus 11:7-8) And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it [is] unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcase. No Images or Hymns Available These ye shall eat of all that [are] in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat: (Deu 14:8-9) The Bible prohibits the eating of pork. Jesus never made permissible the consumption of ‘all’ foods, it was a Pauline innovation by the Gospel writers. The Gnostic leader Marcion (d 140 CE) said that Jewish scribes were corrupting the Gospels by adding Jewish material into them. This proves that the four Gospels were originally composed by Gentile (pagan) writers. Jesus only ate kosher meat and was forbidden to eat pig’s flesh. Jesus said that he had come to uphold the law and not to destroy it one jot or one tithe. Jesus was educated in the synagogue in Jerusalem from the age of twelve. He preached in the synagogue. He used to keep the synagogue clean. No Christian today can be found performing these actions. How many Christians have been even been circumcised in the manner that Jesus was? The services now held in today’s churches were developed long after Jesus had disappeared. Many of them come directly from the pagan Graeco-Roman mythological rites. The prayers they use are not the prayers which Jesus made. The hymns they sing are not the praises which Jesus sung. Due to the innovations of Paul and his followers, there is no revealed teaching left as to what to eat and what not to eat. Anyone given a “Christian education” today eats what he feels like. Yet Jesus and his true followers only ate kosher meat and were forbidden to eat pig’s flesh”. (Jesus, Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, p. 199-200) The Gospels imply that eating pork is forbidden, since Jesus murdered over 2,000 pigs by drowning them in the sea, and he will destroy the pigs on his Second Coming. And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters. (Matthew 8:32, Mark 5:13) Volume 3, Book 34, Number 425: Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, \\"By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, son of Mary (Jesus) will shortly descend amongst you people (Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims ) as a just ruler and will break the Cross and kill the pig and abolish the Jizya (a tax taken from the non-Muslims, who are in the protection, of the Muslim government). Then there will be abundance of money and no-body will accept charitable gifts. (Sahih Bukhari) The Pauline authors did not stop there. The Jewish Law prohibits the consumption of wine (Leviticus 10:9, Proverbs 4:17, 20:1). Yet according to the Gospels, Jesus is made to drink wine, praise wine, and even transform water into wine! Do not drink wine nor strong drink (Leviticus 10:9) Wine [is] a mocker, strong drink [is] raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. (Proverbs 20:1) For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. (Proverbs 4:17) But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble [in] judgment. (Isaiah 28:7) Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. (Joel 1:5) Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart. (Hosea 4:11) Jesus is made to praise wine: Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved. (Matthew 9:17) Jesus is made to drink wine: Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. (Mark 14:25) Jesus is made to transform water into wine Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it]. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, (John 2:7-9) If the Gospels were written by the disciples of Jesus, then the miracle would have been reversed, the transforming of wine into water instead of water into wine. Jesus would never praise wine because it was the poison that caused Noah to get drunk, and Lot to commit incest! The Nazarenes and Ebionites followed the Jewish Law, they abstained from drinking wine. The Ebionites were stigmatized by the Church as heretics who failed to understand that Jesus was a divine person and asserted instead that he was a human being who came to inaugurate a new earthly age, as prophesied by the Jewish prophets of the Bible (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Moreover, the Ebionites refused to accept the Church doctrine, derived from Paul that Jesus abolished or abrogated the Torah, the Jewish law. Instead, the Ebionites observed the Jewish law and regarded themselves as Jews. The Ebionites were not heretics, as the Church asserted, nor 're-Judaizers', as modern scholars call them, but the authentic successors of the immediate disciples and followers of Jesus, whose views and doctrines they faithfully transmitted, believing correctly that they were derived from Jesus himself. They were the same group that had earlier been called the Nazarenes, who were led by James and Peter, who had known Jesus during his lifetime, and were in a far better position to know his aims than Paul, who met Jesus only in dreams and visions. Thus the opinion held by the Ebionites about Paul is of extraordinary interest and deserves respectful consideration, instead of dismissal as 'scurrilous' propaganda -- the reaction of Christian scholars from ancient to modern times. (Hyam Maccoby, The Myth Maker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity) During the Ascension of Prophet Muhammad to Heaven, he was given a choice between milk and wine. This event occurred before alcohol was prohibited. The Holy Prophet chose the milk: Book 001, Number 0309: It is narrated on the authority of Anas b. Malik that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I was brought al-Buraq Who is an animal white and long, larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule, who would place his hoof a distance equal to the range of version. I mounted it and came to the Temple (Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem), then tethered it to the ring used by the prophets. I entered the mosque and prayed two rak'ahs in it, and then came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said: You have chosen the natural thing. Then he took me to heaven… (Sahih Muslim) According to the Bible, the Prophet Noah got drunk! (God forbid) And Noah began [to be] an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard: And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid [it] upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces [were] backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him. And he said, Cursed [be] Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. (Genesis 9:20-25) Prophet Lot commits incest from wine (God forbid) Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, [and] lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. (Genesis 19:33-26) Although these stories are false because they teaches blasphemy against the holy Prophets Noah and Lot, they still convey a moral lesson for mankind that alcohol (wine) is the most dangerous substance that should be rejected by the true followers of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims are the true followers of Jesus because they practice his teachings, the abstinence from alcohol and the consumption of forbidden foods, and they observe fasting. The 12 disciples fasted after Jesus’ departure, and Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims obey their teachings whereas the “Christians” today neglect these laws. Islam, the Kingdom of God, forbids the consumption of alcohol, and purges the society from all social evils. Alcoholic drinks are the only poison that is licensed in many countries. However, Islam took a clear attitude towards alcoholic drinks more than 1400 years ago. Islam prohibits such drinks. Any drink that causes drunkenness is prohibited in Islam regardless of the matter it is made from and regardless of the quantity. According to Islam, if too much of a drink causes drunkenness, then any small quantity of this drink is prohibited, because all alcoholics start with small quantities, and then they become the slaves of alcohol. (Muhammad Ali Alkhuli, The Need For Islam, First Edition 1981, p. 71) This cocktail quality of Western civilization proves that the people of the West are not satisfied with the social structure or the values of their societies and that is why they keep inventing new social trends and ideologies. With this Western chaos of ideologies, how can the ordinary man find mental pace? (ibid, p. 41) Paul, the corrupter of the Gospel, made the drinking of wine permissible (1Timothy 5:23) and the Gospel writers reflected his teaching. Strangely, Paul mentions Noah but says nothing about how he got drunk; he blatantly ignored the story, and allowed the drinking of wine anyways. By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith. (Hebrews 11:7) The Pauline Church persecuted the followers of Jesus until they became extinct. Now today, no Christian can be found observing the Jewish Law. Christians reject Judaism and accept the Old Testament simultaneously, and hypocritically quote from it. With the teaching by some, notably Paul, that the laws of the Jews need not to be followed by a Christian, contradictions began to arise between the body of newly-written Scriptures, which later became known as the “New Testament”, and the Old Testament. However, the Old Testament was retained by the established Church in spite of these contradictions, since an outright rejection of the Old Testament would have been regarded by many of the people as a rejection of Jesus himself. Confusion was the inevitable result. In the attempt to accept and reject the Old Testament simultaneously, contradictions arose within the New Testament itself, since it had to be “new” without openly rejecting the old. But, in the early days of the Church, there was no real attempt to formally arrange the books and ensure that all the accounts and doctrines tallied with each other. The leaders of the first Christian communities were free to use their discretion and to refer to those Scriptures which they thought best contained the teachings of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). (Muhammad Ataur-Raheem, Jesus Prophet of Islam, 1992 edition, pp. 46) Jesus misquotes the Old Testament! The Gospels mention the story of how David ate bread “in the days of Abiathar” And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? How he went into the House of GOD in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? (Mark 2:25-26) The passage is misquoting 1 Samuels 21:1-8, it never says David “ate the bread”, and it was during the time of Ahimleach and not Abiathar! According to Matthew 12:5, Jesus refers to the story of how priests “profaned the Sabbath”. Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless? (12:5) There is no story of priests “profaning the Sabbath” in the Old Testament. Jesus used this mythical story as an excuse for breaking the Sabbath. Conclusion: According to the Bible, Jesus destroyed the very Law that he came to preach. But it must be emphasized that Jesus never broke the Law because he was a true Prophet and Messenger. The Gentile writers of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John fabricated these passages to substantiate the Pauline doctrine. Paul wrote various letters to Church leaders whose background was Gentile and not Jewish. Clement of Rome (d. 97), Ignatius of Antioch (d. 110), Papias of Hierapolis (d. 140) and Polycarp of Smyrna (d. 159) were all uncircumcised pagans (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). The true followers of Jesus were forbidden to preach among Gentiles: These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into [any] city of the Samaritans enter ye not: But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. (Matthew 10:5-6) When Jesus found Unbelief on their part He said: \\"Who will be My helpers to (the work of) Allah.\\" Said the disciples: \\"We are Allah's helpers: We believe in Allah, and do thou bear witness that we are Muslims (Isaiah 56:5: Muslim is the future believers' name, and sons and daughters of GOD titles will be \\"no more\\"; ; Jesus called every believer a Muslim in Luke 6:40) Muslims . (The Holy Quran, 3:52) Jesus ignored a Gentile women begging for help: For a [certain] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast [it] unto the dogs. And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. (Mark 7:25-28)","completion":"The Gospels contain narratives where Jesus appears to diverge from Torah commandments. In the texts of Matthew and Mark, Jesus is represented as saying that all foodstuffs are pure, clashing with the clear prohibition against eating pork established by Jewish Law. \\"It is not what enters the mouth that contaminates a person, but what emerges from it, that defiles.\\" (Matthew 15:11) \\"Why can't you understand?\\" Jesus queried. \\"Do you not realize that nothing external entering a person has the power to contaminate them? It bypasses the heart, passing through the stomach, and is expelled from the body.\\" By making this statement, it was interpreted as if Jesus had pronounced all foods as pure. He continued, \\"It is the expressions from a person that defile them.\\" (Mark 7:18-20) Commentators sometimes add notes suggesting that Jesus declared all foods pure, but these claims are disputed, attaching interpretations that Jesus himself may not have verbalized. The Gospels are thought to be composed with the influence of Paul, who set aside Jewish Law. In crafting this narrative, the Gospel authors allegedly placed words in Jesus' mouth to support Paul's teachings. According to other parts of Matthew, Jesus emphasized fulfilling the Jewish Law, which expressly forbids consuming pork: \\"Pigs, though they have split hooves, do not ruminate; they are unclean to you. You shall not eat their meat, nor touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.\\" (Leviticus 11:7-8) \\"Pigs have split hooves but do not ruminate; they remain unclean for you. You shall not consume their meat, nor touch their dead bodies.\\" (Deuteronomy 14:8-9) The Bible restricts pork consumption. Critics argue that Jesus never endorsed the eating of 'all' foods, and that this idea was later introduced by the Gospel writers inspired by Paul. Marcion of Sinope, a notable figure in early Christianity, accused Jewish scribes of altering the Gospels to include Jewish traditions. This has been understood to suggest the original Gospels were crafted by Gentile authors. Jesus himself practiced kosher dietary laws, abstaining from pork. Jesus claimed to affirm the law down to the smallest detail. From an early age, he was immersed in Jewish religion and customs. Current Christian practices, often not reflecting these ancient customs, are believed to have stemmed from Paul, who is considered by some to have been a significant innovator in Christian theology. Contemporary Christian practices, including dietary habits, are seen as inconsistent with the earliest form of Christianity practiced by Jesus and his followers, who adhered strictly to the Jewish dietary laws. Moreover, the Gospels recount an episode where Jesus sends a herd of swine to their deaths, suggesting that pig consumption is not permissible, and a prophecy depicting the ultimate destruction of pigs signals a continued prohibition. Historical reports also cite that Jesus, who will return as a righteous leader, will eliminate pigs and remove certain taxes, indicating a possible continuation of the forbiddance against pig consumption. Despite Jewish laws against the consumption of wine, descriptions in the Gospels tell of Jesus both drinking wine and celebrating its use: \\"Be sure not to consume wine or strong drink.\\" (Leviticus 10:9) \\"Wine is a mocker, and booze causes brawling; all led astray by them lack wisdom.\\" (Proverbs 20:1) Those who contend that the Gospels were truly written by Jesus' disciples argue that his depiction as a wine drinker runs counter to his otherwise law-abiding portrayal and suggest that it reflects Paul's broader views rather than the original teachings of Jesus. The early sects of Nazarenes and Ebionites, who adhered closely to Jewish laws including abstaining from wine, viewed themselves as the authentic successors to Jesus' disciples, a perspective largely dismissed by later mainstream Christian theology. Islamic scripture recounts an episode where Prophet Muhammad, ascending to heaven, chooses milk over wine, highlighting the preference for purity over intoxication. This pre-Islamic choice along with denigrations of alcohol in the Bible underscore the argument that alcohol consumption is contrary to the principles upheld by true followers of Jesus. The Gospels, it is argued, do not accurately reflect Jesus' teachings; rather, they are thought to have been influenced by Paul's doctrine, which deviated from the original messages._BGR"},{"prompt":"reword this: The Jewish Law prohibits the consumption of wine (Leviticus 10:9, Proverbs 4:17, 20:1).

A very popular verse quoted by the sexual sinners is 1 Corinthians 15:5-8 where Paul says five-hundred people saw Jesus after his resurrection. And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. (The King James Version) (From: https://www.answering-christianity.com/abdullah_smith/legend_of_500_witnesses.htm) This alleged \\"500 witness\\" claim is possibly one of the single silliest, easily refuted, and weakest claims Paul puts forth in his alleged writings. Let us read some throughout refutations disproving Paul's fraudulent assertions: Let us read our first excerpt: Question: Paul claims that Jesus appeared to \\"more than five hundred brethren at one time (see also Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus).\\" Does this present a reliable witness to the Christian claim that Jesus was resurrected? Answer: Some Christians maintain that hallucinations or visions cannot explain the supposed post-resurrection appearances of Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). They claim that some five hundred people, at one time, cannot be deluded with the same vision. It is true that it is unlikely that two or more people would have the same hallucination, not to mention eleven or even five hundred. The question is, however, if the claims made are true to begin with. Paul, writing about twenty-five years after the crucifixion contends, without giving a geographic location, that \\"upwards of five hundred brethren\\" had simultaneously seen the resurrected Jesus and that many of them were still alive at the time of his writing (1Corinthians 15:6). No information is provided to indicate whether this experience was a visionary revelation or an actual appearance in the flesh. Moreover, Paul does not tell us whether he was among the five hundred, or whether he had heard the story from one of them, or whether it was merely a story that was circulating among certain Christians. This alleged postresurrection appearance is conspicuously omitted in both the Gospels and the Book of Acts. Had the Corinthians wanted to verify Paul's statement, it would have been, as Paul must have known, virtually impossible for them to do so, considering the primitive means of communication available in those days. Neither did he mention by name any of the five hundred for possible contact by the Corinthians, had they wanted to seek verification. Who experienced this alleged postresurrection appearance, and when and where this supposedly took place is not stated. The whole incident was either an unverifiable rumor utilized by Paul or simply the result of his overzealous missionary activity. (From: http://www.jewsforjudaism.com/web/faq/faq096.html) My dear brother <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> writes: Christians use this to show that there were over five hundred witnesses that saw Jesus during his resurrection. How come we have no testimony from any of these five hundred people? How come none of these five hundred people ever wrote anything regarding their experiences when they witnessed the resurrection of Jesus? This is all hearsay evidence, which is inadmissible. However, Christians could argue back, 'well Paul would never have made such a daring statement if it weren't true' However, people we need to think about something. The alleged resurrection took place over 800 kilometers away from Corinthia. Do you think that the Corinthians are going to travel all the way and go and investigate that easily? Plus Paul did not indicate where those 500 hundred witnesses were in order for the people to go and ask them. There is really nothing strong or special about this 'evidence'. (From: https://www.answering-christianity.com/bassam_zawadi/five%20hundred%20witnesses.htm) Brother Abdullah Kareem writes: Yet the Gospels never record the legend. Paul, the earliest Christian writer, never mentions the ‘empty tomb’. How do you explain that? Christianity is based on the crucifixion of Jesus, which never occurred. [1] “…Then Paul went on to refer to an appearance by Jesus to five hundred brethren at once, adding his comment that \\"most are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.\\" Who were the five hundred brethren? What happened to this tradition? It was not picked up and described in any recognizable form in any of the later Gospels. There have been attempts to identify Luke's story of Pentecost with this Pauline reference, but no consensus has been reached. It is possible that there was a common link between this note of an appearance to five hundred and Pentecost, though a considerable journey must be made before an event that has a risen body form can be identified with one that has a Holy Spirit form. It is enough now to acknowledge that Paul's reference to Jesus' appearance to five hundred people at once is found nowhere in the Gospel tradition. (John Shelby Spong, Resurrection: Myth or Reality? p. 52) and Paul says Jesus was crucified, yet later confesses that Jesus was not real: In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ. Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. (Ephesians 3:4) Jesus was a spiritual conception, not a real person: Paul’s reasoning had two major consequences. It not only resulted in further changes being made to what Jesus had taught, but also prepared the way for completely changing people’s ideas of who Jesus was. He was being transformed from a man to a conception in people’s minds. (Muhammad Ataur-Raheem, Jesus Prophet of Islam, p. 70) The Pauline Christology has only minimally to do with the actual historical Jesus (Luke 2:52: GOD forgave Jesus' sins and was \\"charitable\\" with him). Hence, the faith in Christ as held by primitive preaching led by Paul was something new in comparison with the preaching of Jesus, it was a new type of religion based god-man of Pagan Religion. (Al Haj A.D. Ajijola, The Hijacking of Christianity, p. 4) Again for more information go to the great links: http://www.jewsforjudaism.com/web/faq/faq096.html https://www.answering-christianity.com/abdullah_smith/legend_of_500_witnesses.htm https://www.answering-christianity.com/bassam_zawadi/five%20hundred%20witnesses.htm So clearly Paul does NOT mention who any details. He does NOT say when or where this \\"500 person appearance\\" allegedly happened and he gives the Corinthians NO information on who the alleged \\"witnesses\\" are and how they can be reached! Again, Paul was writing around 25 years or so AFTER the alleged events of the Gospels. He gives no details, names, or contact information for verification of his claims to the Corinthians. With all this in mind it would have been virtually IMPOSSIBLE, as Paul MUST have known, for the Corinthians to even attempt to verify his claims. The Corinthians had no details or contact information, it was 25 years or so after the alleged Gospel events, the Corinthians were from Corinthia, Greece when the alleged events of the Gospels are supposed to have occurred in Palestine. This was the 1st Century C.E. the Corinthians could not just pick up a telephone, or get on their computer and write an email, or even use the at this time (1st Century C.E.) the long off in the future Morris Code machine!!!! The Corinthians would have all had to either get on an old sail boat, not today's engine powered speed boats!!! Or the Corinthians would have had to do a lot of hiking all over the place and take tons of detours!!!! Being that it was the 1st Century C.E. they were almost assuredly to busy with attempting to protect their basics of survival food, shelter, clothing, etc. to set off on a long journey to attempt to locate these alleged mysterious unnamed witnesses!!!! Also as we all know Paul's letters came before the Gospels and Acts, so if this claim was strong and had any truth to it, how come NONE of the Gospels or Acts makes mention of it. Could it be that the author's of the Gospels and Acts realized Paul had made an absurd, unverifiable claim to the Corinthians and they (the latter Christians) just wanted to forget about it!!!! After reading this information one should be conveinced that this appearance to \\"500 witnesses\\" is unverifiable, did not occur, and is NO evidence at all!!!! All Praise is Due to Almighty Allah!!!!","completion":"Scrutinizing Paul's Assertion of \\"500 Witnesses\\" An examination of the claim made by Christians, based on the writings of Paul, positing that Jesus appeared post-resurrection to 500 witnesses, as stated by Abdullah Kareem: Christians regularly defer to the writings of Paul rather than Jesus’ own teachings, favoring the claims in Paul's epistles. A commonly cited assertion from Paul can be found in 1 Corinthians 15:5-8, where he claims that a collective vision of Jesus was witnessed by five hundred individuals after his resurrection: \\"He appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. After that, he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still living, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.\\" (1 Corinthians 15:5-8, NIV) Refuting Paul's extravagant claim: The reliability of the alleged mass sighting encounter and whether it affirms the resurrection has been questioned. Scholars point out the improbability of such a large group experiencing the same vision, asking if the claims themselves stand true. Paul, writing roughly two decades after the crucifixion, alleges that \\"above five hundred brethren\\" simultaneously witnessed the resurrected Jesus and that many were still alive to confirm this at the time he wrote his letter. Yet, details of the event remain vague, including whether it was a shared vision or an actual physical appearance. Strikingly, neither the Gospels nor Acts record this episode. Verifying Paul's claim would have been a near impossibility for the Corinthians at that time, given the communication constraints. Additionally, Paul failed to name any of the five hundred or specify the details of this supposed event, such as its location. This leads to speculation that the incident was either a rumor exploited by Paul for proselytizing purposes or a product of his fervent missionary zeal. Various authors have expressed skepticism toward this so-called evidence. Bassam Zawadi highlights that no documentation or testimonies from the alleged 500 witnesses exist. The feasibility of Corinthians embarking on an 800-kilometer journey for verification is deemed highly unlikely, especially since Paul provided neither details nor contact information for these supposed witnesses. Regarding the Gospels and Acts, their silence on what would have been a significant corroborating event suggests that later Christian authors may have deemed Paul's declaration too extravagant or unsubstantiated to include in their accounts. In summary, the lack of corroborative accounts or details within Paul's letters or subsequent scriptures casts doubt on the occurrence of this mass sighting. It appears to be neither substantial evidence nor verifiable, thus challenging the credibility of the reported resurrection appearances."},{"prompt":"refute: there were 500 witnesseses in the bible using< the average life expectancy was 30, so Paul writing 20 years after would have been unlikely.","completion":"To refute the claim of 500 witnesses to Jesus' resurrection in the Bible using the average life expectancy argument, you could construct an argument along the following lines: 1. **Life Expectancy Considerations**: The average life expectancy in ancient times was indeed lower than it is today, often cited as around 30 years due to high infant mortality rates and challenging living conditions. However, this number is somewhat misleading because it is heavily influenced by infant and child mortality. If a person survived childhood, their life expectancy would increase significantly. Many adults in the ancient world lived into their 50s, 60s, or even older. 2. **Timing of Paul's Writing**: The First Epistle to the Corinthians, which contains the claim about the 500 witnesses, was written by Paul approximately 20 years after the purported resurrection of Jesus. Even if we were to account for a higher average life span among adult survivors of childhood, the claim of many witnesses still being alive at the time Paul wrote his letter becomes statistically less probable, especially since many of the witnesses would likely have been adults at the time of the alleged resurrection and thus closer to the end of their life expectancy. 3. **Demographics and Travel**: Given the demographics of ancient populations, the mobility of people at that time, and the widespread geographical area from which these 500 witnesses would have likely come, it would have been difficult to verify the continuing existence and experiences of these individuals. People were not as readily traceable as they are today, making it hard for the contemporary audience of Paul's letters to confirm his claims. 4. **Lack of Independent Confirmation**: The Gospels, which are the primary sources for the life of Jesus, do not independently corroborate the appearance to 500 witnesses. The claim is only found in Paul's letter, and not in any contemporary historical accounts or other New Testament writings, which raises questions about its veracity. 5. **Critical Historical Analysis**: Accurate information about large groups witnessing a single event is hard to ascertain, particularly from an era where historical documentation was not systematically approached or as thorough as modern standards. There’s also the issue of historical bias wherein certain writers may inflate numbers to make an event seem more miraculous or significant. 6. **Rhetorical Strategy**: Paul's claim could also be viewed as a rhetorical strategy to persuade his audience of the reality of the resurrection, making the truth of the claim secondary to its persuasive power in the context of early Christian evangelism. Given these considerations, it's argued that the claim of 500 witnesses to Jesus' post-resurrection appearances cannot be taken at face value, and the historical evidence does not conclusively support the account as Paul described it in 1 Corinthians 15."},{"prompt":"for a 3d rpg game, with the player is in control at all times, can dialogue scenes still be engaging even if the player is in third person the whole time?","completion":"Absolutely, dialogue scenes can be still engaging in a third-person 3D RPG. The key aspects that can make dialogue scenes engaging regardless of the perspective include: 1. **Writing Quality**: Well-written dialogue with interesting character interactions, sharp wit, emotional depth, or intriguing lore can capture a player's attention. 2. **Voice Acting**: Strong performances by voice actors can bring characters to life, conveying emotions and nuances that text alone may not. 3. **Character Animations**: Expressive character animations and lip-syncing can give a sense of realism and contribute to the emotional impact of the scenes. 4. **Cinematography**: Thoughtful camera angles and cuts can highlight character reactions and emotions during dialogue, similar to techniques used in film. 5. **Interactivity**: Allowing the player to make dialogue choices can greatly increase engagement, especially when those choices impact the game's story or characters' reactions. 6. **Environmental Storytelling**: Having the dialogue occur within a world that feels alive—with background activities and environmental interactions—can make scenes more immersive. 7. **Contextual Relevance**: If the dialogue is relevant to the player's goals or interests, it will naturally be more engaging. Players should feel like the dialogue is contributing to their experience rather than distracting from it. 8. **Music and Sound Design**: A fitting soundtrack and good sound effects can enhance the mood and highlight the importance of dialogue exchanges. 9. **Accessibility Options**: Options like subtitles with different languages and sizes, or the ability to replay dialogue, can help ensure all players can fully engage with the scenes. It's important to also take into account pacing and the fact that some players may prefer to get back to action quickly. Offering the ability to speed through or skip dialogue (without missing critical information) can help maintain player control and respect their playstyle preferences. Balancing these elements effectively will help keep the players engaged and enhance their overall experience."},{"prompt":"What can you do to make players actually look forward to the quiet, non-action moments, and without trying to hard to impress.","completion":"Creating anticipation for quieter, non-action moments in a game requires thoughtful design choices that emphasize the intrinsic value of these segments. Here are several strategies to make players look forward to these calmer interludes: 1. **Narrative Depth**: Develop a strong, engaging story that makes players care about the characters and world, encouraging them to seek out these moments for additional insights, backstory, and character development. 2. **Rewards and Progression**: Offer rewards during quiet moments, such as lore pieces, items, character upgrades, or unlockables, which provide a tangible incentive for players to engage with these parts of the game. 3. **Character Development**: Use quiet moments to deepen character relationships through dialogue and interactions that can impact the storyline or gameplay, fostering a connection between the player and the game's characters. 4. **Environmental Beauty**: Design breathtaking environments that players will want to explore and enjoy, encouraging slow-paced exploration to soak in the atmosphere and discover hidden details or Easter eggs. 5. **Puzzle Solving**: Introduce light puzzles or mysteries that can be solved during non-action segments, offering mental stimulation and a change of pace from combat or high-intensity gameplay. 6. **Dynamic World**: Implement a world that feels alive, with day-night cycles, weather changes, or events that players can witness or participate in during quieter moments, adding a layer of realism and immersion. 7. **Meaningful Side Quests**: Craft side quests with compelling stories or unique gameplay mechanics that stand out and offer a welcome break from the main action. 8. **Customization Options**: Allow players to engage in customization of their character, base, or equipment, providing a personalized and relaxing experience. 9. **Strategic Planning**: Give players opportunities to strategize, manage resources, or plan their next moves in a safe, non-combative environment, which can be both relaxing and fulfilling. 10. **Ambient Audio**: Employ a high-quality, dynamic soundtrack and ambient sounds that enhance the mood and make quiet moments aurally pleasing. 11. **Emotional Resonance**: Create emotionally resonant scenes that players will want to experience, such as heartfelt moments, humor, or dramatic reveals that are impactful and memorable. These non-action sequences can become compelling through the anticipation of narrative progression, environmental exploration, strategic planning, and emotional engagement. Instead of trying too hard to impress, focus on integrating these moments seamlessly and giving them purpose within the broader context of the game. This approach can naturally lead to players valuing and looking forward to every aspect of the game, not just the action-packed sequences."},{"prompt":"maybe a first person option could help too?","completion":"Certainly, incorporating a first-person perspective can enhance immersion in quieter, non-action moments for several reasons: 1. **Immersion**: First-person view literally puts players into the shoes of the game's protagonist, which can create a stronger connection to the character and world. This can be particularly effective during dialogue, exploration, or when interacting with objects and the environment. 2. **Detail Observation**: In first-person, players can closely examine objects, texts, and smaller environmental details, which might encourage them to take their time and appreciate the subtleties crafted by the developers. 3. **Focused Storytelling**: Story elements and character interactions can become more personal and engaging in first-person, as the camera can hone in on the characters' faces and reactions, making the emotional beats more direct and impactful. 4. **Environmental Interaction**: A first-person perspective can make environmental interactions and puzzles more tactile and engaging, as players manipulate objects or solve puzzles from their character's viewpoint. 5. **Strategic Planning**: When planning the next moves or managing resources, the first-person view can help players focus on UI elements like maps, inventory, or skill trees without the distraction of their character's model. 6. **Situational Awareness**: In first-person, players might feel more present and aware of their surroundings, which can be important during exploration or when absorbing narrative elements. However, it's important to note that the inclusion of a first-person option should be carefully considered based on the game's design. Switching perspectives can present challenges in terms of animation, camera control, and consistency in the player's experience. Additionally, some players may prefer third-person perspective for its wider field of view and ability to see their character's animations and reactions. If you choose to implement a switchable first-person mode, ensure that key aspects of the game, such as UI, character animation, and control scheme, are optimized for both perspectives. This dual approach allows players to choose their preferred style of play and can cater to a wider audience, providing flexibility in how they experience both action-filled sequences and the calmer, narrative-rich moments of the game."},{"prompt":"how could a dynamic, and complex interaction system that could involve things like shoulder patting, hugs, or even face-cradling, even these things being able to be combined with dialogue, be implemented?","completion":"Implementing a dynamic and complex interaction system involving gestures such as shoulder patting, hugs, or face-cradling, especially in combination with dialogue, requires careful planning and programming. It involves several systems working together, such as animation, AI, and dialogue systems. Here's a step-by-step approach: 1. **Animation System**: Develop high-quality animations for all the different interactions you want to include. This may involve motion capture or detailed keyframe animation to achieve natural-looking movements. 2. **Interaction Database**: Create a database or library of interactions that characters can perform, categorized by type (friendly, romantic, aggressive, etc.), and possibly further refined by character traits or relationships. 3. **Proximity and Context Detection**: Implement a system to detect when an interaction is appropriate based on the player's proximity to other characters and the current context or emotional state of the characters involved. 4. **Dialogue Integration**: Integrate these interactions with the dialogue system by allowing certain actions to be chosen alongside or embedded within dialogue choices. This could involve a branching dialogue tree that includes both verbal and physical interaction options. 5. **Character Relationship Tracking**: Develop a system to track the player's relationships with different characters which would influence the type and availability of physical interactions. This could be tied to a reputation system or a more complex character-specific relationship meter. 6. **Branching Outcomes**: Design the game mechanics to include different outcomes based on the player's interaction choices. This could affect the story, the player's reputation, or even gameplay elements like combat and exploration. 7. **Facial Animation and Body Language**: Ensure that facial animations and body language are responsive to the interactions. For example, a character may show surprise or comfort when hugged, which necessitates a variety of facial expressions and body reactions. 8. **Custom Interaction Sequences**: For especially significant moments (like a face-cradle), consider creating custom sequences or cutscenes that can be played out, ensuring these actions are particularly meaningful and memorable. 9. **Testing and Balancing**: Rigorously test the system to ensure interactions feel natural and occur at appropriate times. Avoid excessive or inappropriate use of physical interactions which can lead to discomfort or unintentional humor. 10. **Accessibility and Player Comfort**: Provide options for players who may not want certain types of physical interactions to occur, maintaining comfort levels for a diverse audience. 11. **Feedback System**: Implement feedback through visual cues, sound effects, or controller vibration to enhance the sense of physicality and presence during interactions. To develop such a system, it requires a multidisciplinary approach involving game designers, animators, programmers, and writers working in concert. Additionally, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques could contribute to the adaptive nature of these interactions, making them feel more organic and responsive to the game's evolving circumstances. This level of complexity would likely require an iterative design process, where you build the most basic version of this system first and then layer on additional complexity based on testing and feedback."},{"prompt":"choose a random xman hero, one word only","completion":"Wolverine"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsicalWolverine","completion":"Personalized Modern Artwork Design | Customizable for Mugs, T-Shirts, Posters | Unique Gift Idea | Home Decor and Apparel Art Print"},{"prompt":"مرحبا","completion":"مرحبًا! كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟"},{"prompt":"اريد مقال مفصل عن التداول بالعالم","completion":"التداول هو عملية الشراء والبيع لمختلف الأصول المالية في مختلف أسواق المال حول العالم. هذه الأصول يمكن أن تشمل الأسهم، والسندات، والعملات الأجنبية (الفوركس)، والسلع (مثل الذهب والنفط)، ومشتقات المال (مثل الخيارات والعقود المستقبلية). التداول يمكن أن يتم من خلال البورصات التقليدية أو من خلال الأسواق الإلكترونية. **التداول في البورصات** البورصات هي أماكن مركزية حيث يجتمع المشترون والبائعون لتبادل الأصول المالية وفقًا لقواعد محددة. بعض أشهر البورصات حول العالم: 1. البورصة الأمريكية (NYSE, NASDAQ) 2. بورصة لندن (LSE) 3. بورصة طوكيو (TSE) 4. بورصة شانغهاي 5.

It only amounted to one, and it would always—in his chlorophyll-soaked corneas, tears fed on his urgent panic. Starting over after the repetitive act of violation, he threw up with a violent heave, the primal urge rising in his liver. Bile stained his teeth, and the following retches were acidic, lashing the roof of his mouth with enraged fury. It could never stop: his body rejected the substance over and over; he was hanging by a thread. His eyes scanned the horizon with desperate energy before his lids slid back down, and he was wracked with a violent shiver of resistance. Then, as the urge overcame him yet again, a voice pierced through the sky, a lifeline in his isolation and utter agony. “Can you hear me? Don’t try and answer, just blink twice.” As he fought to drag his eyelids upward, the pain, like a coiling wire, constricted his blood flow in brutal retaliation. “Make it stop—No, I mustn’t,” he choked out. He fought the deep surge of corrosion, like a negative battery melting into a metal cylinder, as his throat tightened. It was just one time. Only ever one; if he expelled the drug from his intestines, it would amount to zero. He was at the end of a long night, his vision raw from never resting his eyes, the blood vessels all but ruptured and torn. The ingested substance had been a sinister mistake, and if he threw up twice, the contraband would be purged from his system; he battled to hold it inside. As Liam writhed in the dying sunlight, his skin erupted in feverish bumps, a crawling sensation exploring the surface of his skin. A shiver of depraved invasion jolted down his spine as he screamed through his clenched teeth in despair. The nausea rose again, claiming his entire being, but his heart continued to pulse, counting away the seconds. “Help me—No. No,” he pled through his locking jaw as he fought another potent wave. The instinctive reaction of his body gripped every fiber as he felt his fight dwindling. He sank his teeth into his gag, screaming against the material bound across his tongue, taunting his strength and resilience. Then, in one dreaded motion, the inevitable rise built within him, futile to resistance. His eyes widened with panic as his gag soon became saturated with the vile substance, leaving a bitter sting as he struggled against it; the retches that followed heaved through his chest. Liam collapsed into the unforgiving embrace of the concrete, his ravaged body welcoming the end with resignation. “Shit,” he lamented in terror, mumbling in heartbroken defeat, “Twice… now it’s too late.” In a mixture of pure shock and trauma, his eyelids slid closed with exhaustion. After his ongoing efforts and endless torment, he failed to hold down the implanted substance, and it was over. But the voice persisted, causing Liam to force his eyes open, gritting his teeth in determination. “No, I’m still here; you just had an intense vomiting episode—hang tight,” the voice reassured. Liam shook his head in disbelief, protesting, the fear tugging at his psyche like a fishing line as he cursed at his helplessness. “No, you can’t help—” As Liam fought to refocus his gaze, a pair of deep hazel eyes locked onto his own with concern. “My name’s Ryan. I just woke up an hour ago; that sound was me dragging my bones over here. I’ve got you.” Liam flinched as his gag was torn from his mouth, and he gasped for fresh air, the invasive atmosphere embalming him with perspiration. “Oh, God, I threw up the contraband—those bastards will kill me like a dog. Or worse-” Liam’s eyes enlarged with realization as he spoke, running a hand through his gritted hair. . “I’ll be, well you saw right? …” Liam’s voice was filled with sickened resignation, his resolve seeping from his pores and evaporating into the arid atmosphere. Ryan clamped his hand down over Liam’s kneecap in a firm gesture of shared solidarity. “I saw everything they did to you, yeah. And I’m still here alright?. Not about to abandon you now…” Liam, reaching up and gripping Ryan’s arm firmly, smiled against the warm twilight rays of daylight that clung to his flesh. “I’m sorry you had to see all this… how long’s it been?” Ryan responded with a gun-metal hollowness, his words smoked out by his steady exhale. “Four weeks. Damed long enough for anyone…” Liam wrapped his arm around Ryan’s shoulder, hoisting himself from the ground into a slouch, bracing his other arm behind himself. “Oh, God, it’s been a whole month… How did I think it was only days?” Ryan only whispered in reply, his voice thick with acknowledgment. “Yeah.” The drugs in his vision burned with a harsh cruelty, and Liam shook his head to regain some clarity. “I don’t even remember how I got here.” Ryan outstretched his lean, muscular arm and hauled Liam to his feet with an exhaustive grunt, wrapping an arm around his chest in support of his weight. “I can explain to you exactly how, but it’s not safe here. Later. Just try to walk with me; you look like hell, but you made it through that so I’m thinking you can limp outta here.”Ryan’s kneecaps bore the bloodstains of his agonising journey across the gravelled concrete , he had limp that almost matched Liam’s broken stride. The air was unrelenting in its suctioning nature, stripping the moisture from their skin as they navigated the bare footpath, no roads or buildings in sight—a concrete ladder of deception that went on for hours, tracking their heavy footsteps. Liam, with his gaze fixated on the maze of concrete, pondered the elapse of time. “How many times did they—” Ryan’s complexion, draining of color, almost revealed a two-digit number. “Eleven times. They assaulted you eleven times. And then you threw up four times on top of that. And they just kept on—” With a haunted expression in his eyes, Liam whispered hoarsely into the still air, his voice heavy with confusion. “How am I alive? You’re telling me I went through that four entire times? I should be dead, not … ” Ryan exhaled a long, steady breath as he hoisted Liam up a notch higher. “They shoved electrolytes down your throat, which was grim as all hell to see. It’s not as if it helped you hold down water; they practically killed you. But you’re still alive, freaking hell, man. You’re a god or something I swear.” Ryan clapped Liam over the shoulder in a shared triumph, as Liam offered a weak smile. “Yeah, I’m a badass, but what’s your place in all this? You’re not a plant, so what were you doing back there?”","completion":"The revision provided seems to be part of a larger narrative and it's quite intense, depicting a character named Liam who's undergoing a severe physical reaction (likely to some form of drug) and a person named Ryan who is there to help him. Overall, the writing is vivid and emotionally charged, creating a palpable atmosphere of distress and survival. However, there are some areas that could be improved for clarity, pacing, and impact: 1. **Reducing Overcomplexity**: The prose is quite dense with metaphors and descriptions. While rich language can enhance a narrative, overusing it can detract from the reader's understanding and the immediacy of the situation. Try simplifying some sentences to make the action clearer. 2. **Consistency in Tone**: The piece swings between very descriptive internal sensations and dialogue. While this can create a comprehensive picture, ensure the transitions between the two are smooth to maintain the flow of the narrative. 3. **Character Development**: Both Liam and Ryan's characters are fleshed out through their actions and speech. Ensure that every interaction reveals something about their personalities, their relationship, or the circumstances to avoid redundant dialogue or descriptions. 4. **Pacing**: Action scenes often benefit from shorter, punchier sentences to reflect the urgency of the situation. The pacing here sometimes slows due to the detailed descriptions. Consider which details drive the story forward and which might be holding it back. 5. **Clarity**: There are moments where the reader might be confused about the context (e.g., \\"'My name’s Ryan. I just woke up an hour ago; that sound was me dragging my bones over here.'\\"). Providing just enough background or hints about the situation can help readers understand the stakes and the characters' motivations. 6. **Dialogue Tags and Actions**: While the dialogue is impactful, sometimes the tags and accompanying actions can be simplified to maintain the intensity of the moment without unnecessary distraction. 7. **Proofreading**: There are a few typos and grammar errors that could be fixed (e.g., \\"Damed\\" should probably be \\"Damn\\", \\"eleven times\\" does not need to be followed by a period, and \\"not\\" should probably be crossed out rather than with a space in \\"not …\\"). 8. **Realism and Believability**: Certain actions or outcomes might feel exaggerated or unrealistic. Try to anchor fantastical elements with some degree of realism to help the reader suspend disbelief. Lastly, considering the serious and intense nature of the content, think about the emotional journey of the reader as well. Pacing not only contributes to the tension of the scene but also allows the reader to breathe, process, and emote with the characters."},{"prompt":"Gmail Postmaster Tools","completion":"Gmail Postmaster Tools is a set of tools designed by Google to help email marketers and organizations that send large volumes of emails monitor and evaluate the health of their email services.

A \\"bad\\" reputation could mean your emails are likely to be marked as spam or even rejected. 3. **Feedback Loop (FBL):** If available, the feedback loop allows senders to receive information about email marked as spam by Gmail users, helping senders to adjust their email campaigns accordingly. 4. **Delivery Errors:** This tool gives data on delivery issues like authentication errors, domain reputation problems, or other sending errors that could impact email delivery. 5. **Authentication:** It shows traffic that passed SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance), which are important email authentication standards that help in preventing spoofing and phishing. 6. **Encryption:** This will show what percentage of your email traffic is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS), which is crucial for users' privacy and data security. To use Gmail Postmaster Tools, you must authenticate your domain and prove you own it. You do this by adding a DNS TXT or a CNAME record. Once authenticated, you can view your domain’s performance data through the Postmaster Tools dashboard. Improving these factors shown in the Postmaster Tools should help to ensure better inbox placement within Gmail and ideally, fewer emails ending up in the spam folder. Remember that Google continually updates its algorithms and toolsets, so the features and functionalities of Gmail Postmaster Tools may evolve over time. Keep in mind the knowledge cutoff date for this information, and for the latest details, you should directly refer to the information provided by Google's Gmail Postmaster Tools."},{"prompt":"give me example to check it","completion":"To check your email sending performance using Gmail Postmaster Tools, you need to first set it up by verifying ownership of the domain you're sending emails from.

The Gmail Postmaster Tools is a web-based interface and is meant to be used manually to view and manage your email sending reputation and metrics data. As a result, there isn't a Python code snippet I can provide that would directly interact with a Postmaster Tools API to fetch this data for you because such an API is not publicly documented or made available by Google. If you need to automate data retrieval from Gmail Postmaster Tools, some developers might consider using browser automation tools like Selenium to scrape data from the Dashboard. However, this is not officially supported by Google, and scraping can violate their terms of service. It is also brittle, as any changes Google makes to their dashboard's structure or authentication can break a scraping setup. If you must automate the collection of email metrics, consider looking at the data provided to you via your email service provider (ESP) or through SMTP logs if you manage your own servers. Many ESPs offer APIs that allow you to retrieve metrics about your email campaigns programmatically. Here is a hypothetical outline of how you might use an ESP's API with Python, using the \`requests\` library: \`\`\`python import requests # Replace with your API key, endpoint and payload/data structure as per your ESP's API documentation api_key = \\"YOUR_API_KEY\\" api_endpoint = \\"https://api.your-esp.com/v1/reports\\" headers = { \\"Authorization\\": \\"Bearer \\" + api_key, \\"Content-Type\\": \\"application/json\\" } # Fetch statistics, adjust params as needed response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers) if response.status_code == 200: # Process your data email_data = response.json() print(email_data) else: print(f\\"Failed to retrieve data: {response.status_code} - {response.text}\\") \`\`\` For specific usage, you need to refer to your ESP's API documentation since URLs, headers, request methods, and JSON payloads will vary from one provider to another.

However, at the time of my last update, Google did not offer a public Gmail Postmaster Tools API, so the endpoint you're referencing might be new or may belong to a different system, an internal tool not accessible to the public, or a part of Google's services that requires special access. If Google has since introduced an API for Gmail Postmaster Tools and you have access to it, you'd typically use the endpoint URL as the base for making HTTP requests to various resources provided by the API. You would also need to authenticate your requests, possibly using OAuth 2.0, which is a common authentication mechanism for Google APIs. Below is a generic example in Python using the \`requests\` library to show how you might interact with a hypothetical API: \`\`\`python import requests from oauth2client.client import GoogleCredentials from httplib2 import Http # Get the credentials and create an HTTP object using the credentials credentials = GoogleCredentials.get_application_default() http_auth = credentials.authorize(Http()) # The base_url is the endpoint URL given to you; all other routes will be relative to this base_url = 'https://gmailpostmastertools.googleapis.com' # The sub_path is the path to the specific resource you want to access within the API sub_path = '/v1/someResource' # Complete URL url = f'{base_url}{sub_path}' # Add Bearer token in headers if needed headers = { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + credentials.access_token, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } # Make a GET request response = requests.get(url, headers=headers) # Handle the response if response.status_code == 200: data = response.json() print(data) else: print(f\\"Error: {response.status_code}, Response Content: {response.content}\\") \`\`\` Please note that using Google APIs usually requires setting up a project in the Google API Console, enabling the specific API, and obtaining the proper OAuth 2.0 credentials. Also, the actual implementation details, such as the structure of the request and the exact way you handle authentication, will depend on the documentation provided by Google for that particular API. In practice, you would need to read the official documentation for the specific route structures, parameters, and the data models expected/requested by the Gmail Postmaster Tools API. The code given above is for instructional purposes and likely requires adjustments to work with the actual API if it exists.

These keys are mathematically linked—specifically, they are generated together using cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems that are easy to compute in one direction but hard to reverse. The most common type of public key cryptographic system is based on the difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, known as the RSA algorithm, or on the discrete logarithm problem, which is the basis for algorithms like Diffie-Hellman, ElGamal, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Let's break down why a public key can be derived from a private key, but not vice versa: 1. **One-Way Functions**: Public key algorithms are based on mathematical operations that are easy to perform in one direction but difficult to reverse. For instance, multiplying two large prime numbers is straightforward, but factoring their product back into the original primes is extremely difficult when the numbers are sufficiently large (as in RSA). Another example is calculating a point multiplication on an elliptic curve (as in ECC), which is easy, but reversing this to find out which scalar (private key) was used is hard due to the discrete logarithm problem. 2. **Key Generation Process**: During key pair generation, the private key is typically created first from a random or pseudorandom number. Then, the public key is computed from this private key. For example, in RSA, the private key is derived from two randomly chosen large prime numbers. The public key is derived from the product of these two primes (the modulus) and an additional value (the exponent). The relationship between the public key and the private key is such that the public key parameters are functions of the private key values, but the reverse calculation is not feasible due to the one-way function. 3. **Asymmetry in Knowledge**: Public key cryptography is specifically designed so that knowledge of the public key does not reveal the private key. This property allows users to share their public keys without compromising the security of their private keys. If it were possible to easily derive the private key from the public key, the system would be insecure since anyone with access to the public key (which is, by definition, public information) could then decrypt messages or impersonate the owner of the key pair. In summary, the purpose of public key cryptography is to create a system where two related keys have asymmetric properties: a publicly shareable key that doesn't compromise the secrecy of a corresponding private key. This asymmetry arises from the reliance on mathematical problems that are easy to compute in one direction but are considered infeasible to reverse without additional information (namely, the private key)."},{"prompt":"what are P2PKH and P2PSh typs of address","completion":"P2PKH and P2SH are two types of addresses used in the Bitcoin network to send and receive transactions. They correspond to different methods for encoding and securing Bitcoin funds and have corresponding scripting mechanisms within the Bitcoin scripting system. Here's a breakdown of each: 1. **P2PKH (Pay to Public Key Hash)**: - P2PKH stands for \\"Pay to Public Key Hash.\\" - It is the most common form of Bitcoin address and was the original address format used by Bitcoin. - P2PKH addresses begin with the number \\"1\\" when encoded in Bitcoin's Base58Check format. - These addresses correspond to the hash of the public key. This means instead of revealing the actual public key in the address, a hash of the public key is used, providing an extra layer of security. - When someone sends Bitcoin to a P2PKH address, they are actually sending it to a hash of the recipient's public key. - To spend funds sent to a P2PKH address, the recipient must provide a signature generated by their private key and their actual public key in the unlocking script to prove ownership of the funds. 2. **P2SH (Pay to Script Hash)**: - P2SH stands for \\"Pay to Script Hash.\\" - P2SH addresses provide a way to send transactions to scripts with more complex conditions for spending, also known as \\"scriptPubKey\\" or redeem script. - They begin with the number \\"3\\" when encoded in Bitcoin's Base58Check format. - A P2SH address is a hash of the script that must be provided and executed to spend the funds (the redeem script). - This allows for more flexible and secure transactions, such as multisig wallets, where multiple signatures are required to authorize a transaction. - A person sending Bitcoin to a P2SH address doesn't need to know the details of the conditions required to spend the Bitcoins; they only send their transaction to the address’ hash. - The recipient(s) must provide the redeem script matching the hash in the P2SH address along with the required data according to the script (e.g., required number of signatures in a multisig setup) to spend the funds. In summary, P2PKH is the traditional method of sending Bitcoin to a single user's public key hash, while P2SH allows for more complex transactions where bitcoins are sent to a script hash and conditions need to be met to redeem the funds. Both address types are wholly supported by the Bitcoin network and designed to suit different transaction requirements."},{"prompt":"what is base58 check encoding in tems of bitcoin","completion":"Base58Check encoding is a modified version of Base58 encoding used commonly in Bitcoin to convert large integers into alphanumeric text. The key features of Base58Check make it particularly useful for encoding Bitcoin addresses and certain other types of data to be handled by humans. Here's how Base58Check encoding works and why it's used within the Bitcoin ecosystem: 1. **Base58 Encoding**: - Base58 encoding is similar to the well-known Base64 encoding, but it omits characters that might look similar and be confusing to humans. These characters include the number \\"0\\" (zero), the uppercase letter \\"O\\", the uppercase letter \\"I\\", and the lowercase letter \\"l\\", as well as the \\"+\\" and \\"/\\" symbols used in Base64. - This leaves 58 characters: 0-9 (excluding 0), A-Z (excluding I and O), and a-z (excluding l). - Base58 encoding is used to turn large integers into a string of these characters, making the data more compact and easier to write down, communicate, and type without error. 2. **Check**: - The \\"Check\\" part of Base58Check comes from the addition of error-detection code to the data being encoded. Before the base58 encoding is applied, a checksum is computed by taking the first four bytes of the double SHA-256 hash of the rest of the data. - This checksum is appended to the original data, and the combination is then encoded using Base58. - The addition of the checksum helps detect typos and accidental alterations of the data when it's written or typed by a human. 3. **Usage in Bitcoin**: - In the context of Bitcoin, Base58Check encoding is used to turn binary data into an alphanumeric string that can be easily shared. Bitcoin addresses are a common example. A Bitcoin address includes components like a version prefix (which helps to define the use of the address or the network it belongs to), the hash from a public key or script, and the checksum. - When a Bitcoin address is generated, the binary data is first prefixed with the version byte. Then, the checksum is calculated and appended. Finally, Base58Check encoding is used to turn this concatenated data string into the address that users share. The motivation for using Base58Check encoding in Bitcoin is to minimize the risk of errors when copying, writing down, or reading addresses verbally. The characters are selected to be distinguishable from one another, thus Base58 helps reduce human error. The added checksum allows for the early detection of accidental changes, such as mistyping an address, increasing the overall reliability of Bitcoin transactions."},{"prompt":"Hi buddy, I will be going to my aunt's home for nearly 5 days and I am worried about my studies as it will affect my study schedule a lot since my aunt has 2 toddler who are very naughty and not let me study. How can I make minimal damage limitation to my studies and please keep in mind that I will be without any laptop and only my phone.

Since you'll be without a laptop but will have your phone, here are some strategies to help you maintain your studies with minimal disruption: 1. **Plan Ahead**: - Prioritize your study topics and determine what you absolutely must accomplish during those five days. - Create a detailed study schedule for the days you'll be at your aunt's house, breaking down your study time into manageable chunks. 2. **Utilize Mobile-Friendly Study Resources**: - Before leaving, download any necessary eBooks, articles, study apps, podcasts, or educational videos that you can access on your phone. - Make sure you have access to mobile versions of any online platforms you regularly use for studying. 3. **Set Clear Boundaries**: - Discuss your situation with your aunt beforehand. Explain that you need to study and ask for her support in finding quiet times and places where you can focus without interruption. 4. **Study During Quiet Hours**: - Plan to study early in the morning before the toddlers wake up or during their nap times in the afternoon when the house is quieter. - If you're a night owl, study after they've gone to bed. Just ensure you're not compromising your own sleep schedule. 5. **Use Noise-Canceling Headphones**: - If you have noise-canceling headphones or earbuds, bring them along. They can be a lifesaver when you need to block out background noise and concentrate. 6. **Be Flexible**: - Accept that your regular study routine may not be possible, and be prepared to adapt. Use shorter study sessions and focus on the quality of study rather than the quantity. 7. **Stay Organized**: - Use apps for time management and organization on your phone. Set reminders or alarms for your study sessions and tasks you need to complete. 8. **Maximize Downtime**: - Use any unexpected free moments to review notes, read, or listen to educational material. Even 10-15 minutes can be valuable. - Carry a small notebook for quick revisions or to jot down things if your phone isn't available. 9. **Stay Active Physically and Mentally**: - Take short breaks to play with the toddlers or help out your aunt. This will give you a mental break and may make it easier to negotiate quiet study times since you're also participating in family life. 10. **Communicate with Study Partners**: - If you have a study group, keep in touch with them. They can help you catch up on anything you might miss and provide moral support. 11. **Set Realistic Goals**: - Understand that your study pace might be slower.

They simultaneously function as both cushy armor and apparel and are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but considered mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading' is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer! And diapers aren't just for wearing, either; many of them are so thick they can double as blankets, pillows, even mattresses! Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw, the frequency determined the character's incontinence and eating habits; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly incontinent Loaders fail automatically. A worn diaper that has met its capacity imposes the effects of encumbered on its wearer and needs to be changed out of, an act that requires an action from another ally, a fresh diaper on hand and a suitable changing spot where the task can be performed. Alternately, if one is in a rush or there is no such changing spot nearby, a second diaper can be layered over a full one; layering provides a temporary additional 50 lbs. of Loading capacity but doesn't remove the negative effects. The effects should describe the benefits and drawbacks that a character wearing the diaper would experience, while the description should describe the diaper's appearance. Example 1: **Plain Pull-Ups** (Common item, Light Diaper): *0.5 lbs., 5 gp, 15 lbs. Load capacity.* \\"A diaper as basic as it is ubiquitous. It isn't particularly protective nor roomy, but it doesn't slow you down any.\\" Example 2: **XXXL Supreme Poofies** (Rare item, Heavy Diaper Armor): *8 lbs., 255 gp, 300 lbs. Load capacity, +3 to AC, movement speed reduced by 10 feet, attacks to the behind of wearer deal 1d10 less damage (minimum of 1), wearer gains the unique \\"Powder Cloud\\" passive trait when worn (when hit by an attack to the behind, a thick cloud of baby powder will billow outwards and briefly fog a wide area. A 10-foot wide spherical area of powder is created centred on the wearer, becoming lightly obscured for 1 round. This trait recharges after using an action to refill the diaper with powder).* \\"The thicker cousin to its XL and XXL counterparts, the huge quadruple tapes used to secure this mattress-thick pamper around someone's hips are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as a shortsword.\\" Example 3: **Hot Heavy-Duty Huggies** (Uncommon item, Medium Diaper Armor): *1.2 lbs., 55 gp, 80 lbs. Load capacity, +1 to AC, wearer and allies within 20 feet gain resistance to cold damage (increases to 30 feet when 40 lbs. Loaded or more), wearer's weapon and spell attacks deal an extra 1d4 fire damage, wearer has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws against pooping.* \\"Diapers are naturally warm, but this flame-branded pamp radiates a constant magical heat so potent it can be felt from several feet away, as if it were full of molten... something or other. One must take care to not become *too* relaxed...\\" Example 4: **Pail of Holding** (Very rare, wondrous item): *4 lbs., 3350 gp. This oversized metal diaper pail is around 4 feet wide and 8 feet tall, and opens to a nondimensional space capable of containing 5 tonnes of full diapers. As an action, you can put a full diaper into the pail, or pull one out. Regardless of what is put into the pail, it always weighs its fixed amount. If the pail is destroyed or forcibly filled beyond its capacity, it ruptures and the diapers contained inside spill everywhere, covering a 10-foot cube for every tonne of diapers (i.e 2 tonnes cover a 20-foot cube).* \\"The lid of this embroidered, tall-as-a-person pail depicts a smiling female halfling gleefully filling her expected undergarments.\\"","completion":"- **Bouncy Booty Briefs** (Common item, Light Diaper Armor) - Description: Light, pastel-colored attire with tiny bells and ribbons attached. - Effects: +1 to AC, adds a jingly sound with each step, giving disadvantage on Stealth checks. - Value: 20 gp - Weight: 0.5 lbs. - Load Capacity: 20 lbs. - Rarity: Common - Type: Armor (Light) - **Giant's Cushion Coveralls** (Rare item, Heavy Diaper Armor) - Description: Enormous and plush, complete with reinforced seams to withstand giant-sized Loadings. - Effects: +4 to AC, movement speed reduced by 15 feet, -1d12 damage from blunt attacks to the behind, deals 1d4 extra damage on successful hip checks. - Value: 500 gp - Weight: 10 lbs. - Load Capacity: 400 lbs. - Rarity: Rare - Type: Armor (Heavy) - **Waddle-Wonder Wraps** (Uncommon item, Medium Diaper Armor) - Description: Features a magical charm that makes the diaper sway hypnotically when moving. - Effects: +2 to AC, adds 5 feet to walking speed, however character sways while moving which may give attackers advantage on opportunity attacks. - Value: 125 gp - Weight: 1.5 lbs. - Load Capacity: 100 lbs. - Rarity: Uncommon - Type: Armor (Medium) - **Sturdy Stink-Stoppers** (Rare item, Accessory) - Description: Wonderful and whimsical clothespins designed to be affixed to the nose. - Effects: Grants advantage on saving throws against stench-based attacks or effects, can be used three times before losing potency. - Value: 75 gp - Weight: Negligible - Rarity: Rare - Type: Accessory - **Spellcaster's Soggy Slippers** (Uncommon item, Footwear) - Description: Soft, overstuffed slippers enchanted to absorb the magical essence of spells. - Effects: When wearer casts a spell of 1st level or higher, they gain temporary hit points equal to the level of the spell. - Value: 175 gp - Weight: 0.8 lbs. - Rarity: Uncommon - Type: Footwear - **Enchanted Expando-Nappies** (Very rare item, Light Diaper Armor) - Description: Diapers that grow in fluffiness and scales in pattern to match the wearer's growth in power. - Effects: +2 to AC, Load Capacity increases by 10 lbs. each time the wearer levels up, grants a +2 bonus to Constitution saving throws. - Value: 2000 gp - Weight: 2 lbs. - Load Capacity: 50 lbs.

Here are some examples of these abilities: **Feats** - **Maximum Capacity Master** - Prerequisite: Must be wearing a diaper - Your expertise with Load management allows you to exceed the normal capacity of your diaper. When you successfully save against Loading, you can choose to increase the diaper's capacity by 25% of its base limit, stacking with each successful save. - Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws to resist the effects of being encumbered by a loaded diaper. - **Swift Swaddler** - Prerequisite: Must have changed a diaper at least 100 times - You have mastered the art of changing diapers quickly. You can now use a bonus action to change your own or an ally's diaper, provided you have the necessary supplies and a willing or incapacitated subject. - Allies changed by you gain temporary hit points and a bonus to their next ability check. - **Load Bearer** - You embrace the weight of your diaper, turning it into a source of strength. Your carrying capacity is doubled, and you do not suffer movement penalties from your own loaded diaper unless it exceeds twice its rated capacity. - You may also use a reaction to distribute the weight of your Load, granting you or an ally a temporary boost to Strength or Constitution for one round. - **Padded Acrobat** - Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher - You have learned to maneuver gracefully despite the bulk of a loaded diaper. You gain advantage on Acrobatics checks, and your jumps are cushioned, reducing fall damage by an amount equal to the Load in your diaper. - **Aromatic Adept** - You've cultivated resistance to foul odors. You gain advantage on Saving Throws against effects that rely on smell. - As an action, you can release a potent burst from your diaper to create a stinking cloud (as the spell) centered on you with a range that correlates to your Load. **Actions** - **Load Launch** - As a special attack action, if your diaper is loaded, you can relieve yourself with such force that you propel yourself forward or backward 5 feet. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks. - **Diaper Defense** - As a bonus action, you can tighten the seals on your diaper to provide additional temporary hit points as you brace for impact, based on its current Load level. - **Hygienic Hustle** - As an action, if an ally is incapacitated or willing, you can swiftly clean and change their diaper, removing any negative status effects associated with a fully loaded diaper. - **Cushion Crash** - As a reaction when hit by a melee attack, you may attempt to use the cushioning of your diaper to lower the damage. Roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the incoming damage. If your diaper is loaded by at least half its capacity, roll a d10 instead. - **Fluff Frenzy** - On your turn, you can whip into a diaper-induced frenzy, kicking up a cloud of powder or padding material around you. For the next minute, any enemy that ends its turn within 5 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. This effect can only be used once per short or long rest. By incorporating these specialized abilities into the game, players can deeply immerse themselves in a world where diapers are not only necessary but also a central feature of combat and daily life. These Feats and actions provide additional tactical options and role-playing opportunities for players to explore."},{"prompt":"I like your portrayal of diapers in this world being seen as cute and innocent instead of sexualizing it, its what I was going for. Could you perhaps expand upon the world-building of how diapers are so essential in this world? How did they become so normalized? How are they created; are more regular diapers made through ordinary means, such as stitching and needling? Are more huge and magical diapers created in giant dedicated forges? The juxtaposition of dedicating something as massive as a mountain-sized forge to create something as mundane as oversized diapers may sound absurd to us, but in such a world as this its entirely justified, a necessity even!","completion":"In this whimsical and unique world where diapers are not only normalized but also an essential aspect of everyday life, their prevalence and importance could stem from a variety of cultural, historical, and economic factors. Below is a world-building framework to explore the role diapers play in this society: **Historical Context** - **Origins in Necessity**: The world may have been affected by a powerful curse or magical phenomenon that altered the physiology of all inhabitants, necessitating the use of diapers. Perhaps this was initially a disaster, but over time, people adapted culturally and technologically to this way of living. - **Heroic Heritage**: An ancient hero known for their might and magical resilience also donned a powerful enchanted diaper that became a symbol of strength. This hero's legacy made diapers not only practical but a sign of fortitude and power. - **Economy of Expulsion**: The land could be incredibly fertile, thanks to a unique property of the soil that reacts extraordinarily well to natural fertilizers. As such, population \\"Loadings\\" became a primary way to nurture the land, leading to societal shifts in clothing choices. **Manufacturing and Trade** - **Domestic Diapering**: Regular diapers for everyday use are crafted through traditional means such as stitching, weaving, and tanning. Materials range from cotton and linen to specialty fibrous plants that hold exceptional absorbency. Craftspeople, known as \\"Swaddlers,\\" are respected artisans within this society, and their workshops are as ubiquitous as blacksmiths would be in other worlds. - **Enchanted Emporiums**: Magical diapers intended for adventurers and the elite are crafted by specialized \\"Diapermancers,\\" individuals skilled in imbuing garments with spells and extra-dimensional properties. These rare artisans often work in grand workshops or towers adorned with representations of the heroic diaper-clad champions of yore. **Cultural Integration** - **Ceremony and Celebration**: Significant life events are marked by the gifting or crafting of special diapers, from the small and intricately embroidered \\"Newborn Nappies\\" to the lavishly padded \\"Elder Easements\\" given to respected community members as they age. - **Diaper Duels and Sports**: Competitions and public events often revolve around the mastery of one's diaper—races where the heaviest Loads result in greater speed due to magic, diaper dueling arenas where combatants wield padded prowess, and feats of acrobatics where a well-loaded diaper can mean the difference between a harsh landing or a comfortable bounce. - **Rites of Passage**: Young members of society may embark on Diaper Quests to craft or earn their first magical diaper, marking the transition from youth to adulthood and symbolizing their ready acceptance of responsibility and their place in society's cycle. **Diaper Forges** - **Mighty Machinations**: As magical diapers are a necessity for protection and utility, there are indeed massive forges dedicated to their creation. These \\"Swaddleholds\\" are found in the heart of volcanic mountains or floating among the clouds, harnessing the raw magical elements necessary to forge the finest diapers. - **Elemental Embellishments**: Elemental creatures may be employed within these forges to infuse their essence into the fabric—Fire Elementals to heat and meld reinforcements, Water Elementals to wash and bless each layer, Earth Elementals to grind mystical talcum powder, and Air Elementals to puff the diapers to peak fluffiness. - **Economical Ecosystem**: These forges act as essential hubs for the economy, providing jobs to a large swath of the population—the gathering of materials, actual diaper forging, enchanting, testing, and eventually the trade and sale of these crucial garments. In this world, diapers represent far more than mere practicality—they're woven into the culture, economy, and spiritual life of its inhabitants. The outrageousness of mountain-sized forges producing diapers is normalized and honored because in this land, they are a linchpin, a point of pride, and a commonplace necessity, all combined into one comfortably padded package."},{"prompt":"Could you write an in-universe introduction that describes the mystical process of forging and the subsequent donning of (and imminent filling with massive Loads) huge diapers in this setting from a narrator's point of view? Each diaper has its own life cycle, so to speak; its creation, its completion, its time spent around a creature's hips, its inevitable filling, the following diaper change out of it and into a new one, and then its disposal.","completion":"In a realm where the humble diaper transcends mundane utility to become a vessel of magical protection and cultural significance, the crafting of these essential garments is steeped in mysticism and artistry. Allow me to unfurl the tapestry of their lifecycle, from the fires of creation to the finality of their disposal. **Creation - The Birth of Bulwark Breeches** In the fiery hearts of Swaddleholds, nestled amidst the cradles of volcanic might or anchored amidst the billowing clouds, the forge-masters and Diapermancers gather. With incantations whispered and hammers rung, echoing like a mother's cooing lullaby, the diapers begin to take shape. They start as mere gambits of fabric, deftly woven from the rarest of enchanted cottons and silks, harvested from fields bathed in moonlight and sun-drenched meadows. As the layers pile, one atop the other, the Elemental Embellishers are summoned. Earth for firmness, Fire for soul's warmth, Air for the gentle caress of comfort, and Water for purity in its embrace. These creatures dance and cavort amongst the Swaddleholds, imparting their essences into the burgeoning diapers with each caper and turn. **Completion - From the Anvil to the Adventurer** The diapers, now brimming with the vitality of the elements, are taken to the finishing chambers. Here, the Diapermancers chant and thread the final enchantments into the plush folds. Runes of containment, talismans of fortitude, charms of weightless buoyancy—that despite the inescapable loads they will bear, the wearer may find their burden lightened. A ceremonious completion as the Legion of Launderers—clerics of cleanliness—bless each crafted diaper, anointing it with sacred oils that repel the foulest of odors. Now ready, they are presented to heroes, to travelers, to the citizenry—each its chosen bearer, a guardian of the land's fertility. **Donning - A Rite of Passage** The ritual of donning the diaper is a personal, meditative juncture. A moment where creature and cushion become one, affixing the myriad belts and snaps, the oversized pins clasping with a satisfying click. With it, a sense of preparedness, an embrace of life's cycle—a bond formed not merely of cloth and charm, but of destiny's thread. **Filling - The Inevitable Embrace** And as the adventurers venture forth, braving dungeon depths and scaling heights unspoken, the diapers—and therein their wearers—find an enduring symbiosis. In the heat of battle or the silence of respite, the Loads come. A constitution tested, a release granted, a diaper living up to its deepest calling. They swell with pride, each filling a testament to their purpose, the wearers unfazed, for they know this is the way of their world. **Changing - The Passing of the Mantle** Yet such is the nature of all things, that capacity once challenged, must, in time, surrender. In glades beneath the whispering trees or alcoves carved in ancient rock, allies bend and tend to one another—a change, a relief, an endearing vulnerability met with care. Out with the laden, in with the new, a cycle repeated with trust and camaraderie. **Disposal - The Return to the Earth** Now full, spent, the diaper journeys to its final rest. Not discarded as mere refuse, but given back to the earth that nourished its cotton, its magic. The Lands of Looming Bins—a place where shamans of decay lovingly guide the diapers to become one with the soil. Enchanted compost that turns to blossom and grain, their essence seeding tomorrow's fields. In their lifecycle—a creation of fire, an adornment of life, a filling of experiences, a tender exchange of trust, and a return to the deep bosom of the earth itself—the diapers of this realm are far more than mere attire. They are artifacts of a circle unbroken, the circular tale of life that in its telling binds the living soil to the stars above."},{"prompt":"What is The Land of Looming Bins?","completion":"The Land of Looming Bins is a unique locale within this diaper-centric realm, functioning as the final resting place for diapers that have served their purpose and reached the limit of their capacity. Here, in this specialized area dedicated to the recycling and rejuvenation of used garments, the diapers are not seen as waste, but as contributors to the ongoing cycle of life and magic. **Geographical Features:** The Land of Looming Bins may be a vast expanse of rich, compostable fields, punctuated with enormous receptacles—'Bins'—each designed to receive diapers of various sizes and enchantments. The land could be verdant in places, where the process of decomposition has already borne fruit—quite literally, as flora thrive on the potent, transformed residues of the diapers. **Function and Process:** In a world where diapers are central to both individual and societal function, efficient and respectful disposal methods must mirror their importance. Shamans, known as Diaper Decomposers or Nappy Naturalists, oversee the transmutation of soiled diapers into beneficial, mystical compost. These shamans use a blend of earth-based magic and natural alchemy to accelerate decomposition, neutralize odors, and sanctify the grounds as a place of rebirth. Diapers, upon their arrival, are sorted into the appropriate Bins based on their materials and enchantments—a meticulous and sacred process. **Cultural Significance:** The Land of Looming Bins is not merely a disposal ground; it's a shared, community-driven effort reflecting the interconnectedness of every citizen with the land that sustains them. It's a testament to their respect for the cycles of life—where magical Load becomes a source of literal growth and prosperity. **Magic and Ecology:** The deep interplay of magic and ecology is most evident here—where arcane residues are carefully managed to ensure balance and fertility. Diapers with lingering enchantments are dealt with in specialized Bins where spells can safely unravel, and the magical nutrients seep into the growing medium below. **Tourism and Education:** The Land of Looming Bins may even be a site of pilgrimage, education, and tourism.

\`systemmessage\`（系统消息）：这种类型的消息通常由系统自动生成并由系统处理。系统消息可能包括错误通知、状态更新、系统警告或其它不需要用户介入的自动通信。例如，如果一个服务器宕机，系统可能自动发送一个系统消息给管理员通知这个情况。 **场景**: 在服务端应用中表明系统状态变更、日志记录、错误报告；在客户端应用中显示应用状态，如系统更新、应用错误等。 - \`HumanMessage\`（人类消息）：顾名思义，这种类型的消息是为了与人类用户交流而设计的。这可以包括聊天消息、用户生成的反馈、提问和其他形式的用户交互。 **场景**: 在用户界面中作为用户之间通信的媒介，如社交应用中的聊天功能；或者是用户与客户服务之间的互动，如帮助台应用中的服务请求。 在不同场景下，可能需要对这两种类型的消息处理进行分离，以确保系统稳定运行并且用户界面易于理解。例如，一个系统可能有个后台进程负责处理 \`systemmessage\`，而有一个前台界面用于展示和发送 \`HumanMessage\`。这种设计可以帮助提高系统的可维护性，并且使得用户界面更加友好。 仅凭这两个术语，不太可能细致地讲述它们的适用场景，因为这将很大程度上取决于你的应用的具体上下文和你的需求。如果需要更具体的信息，你可能需要提供详细的上下文或查阅相关的设计文档。"},{"prompt":"大模型中systemmessage HumanMessage的区别,分别适合什么场景","completion":"在大型模型或系统中的上下文中，\`systemmessage\` 和 \`HumanMessage\` 依然可能指代不同来源的信息流，不过具体的含义和使用场景可能有所差异，取决于模型的设计和目标，这里以一个假设的机器学习模型或者AI系统为背景进行解释。 1. **systemmessage (系统消息):** 在AI系统中，\`systemmessage\` 可能是指系统内部生成的消息。这些消息是模型运行或执行过程中产生的，并用于内部的日志记录、警告、错误处理、通知或审计目的。例如，在使用机器学习模型进行数据处理时，系统可能会产生消息来通知管理员模型训练进度、性能指标、异常检测等。 **适合场景包括:** - 系统的健康和性能监控。 - 通知开发人员或操作人员关于系统内部状态的变化。 - 自动化的错误检测和异常报告。 - 跟踪和审计AI系统的行为。 2. **HumanMessage (人类消息):** 对于大型模型或系统，\`HumanMessage\` 可能是指用户与系统交互时生成的消息。这包括用户的查询、指令或者是通过用户界面和系统交流的任何形式的消息。在一个基于AI的客服系统中，客户留下的反馈或问题将被视为 \`HumanMessage\`。 **适合场景包括:** - 用户界面交互，如用户提供输入，系统提供响应。 - 用户支持和客服对话系统，处理用户请求和提问。 - 通过聊天机器人进行的对话服务，用户与机器人的交流消息。 在理解了这些术语的情境之后，选择何种消息类型要根据具体的应用案例。系统工程师需要确保对于任何\`systemmessage\`和\`HumanMessage\`都有适当的处理和响应策略，以便系统能够高效、稳定并且对用户友好地运行。例如，系统消息可能需要出色的监控和告警系统来保持服务质量，而人类消息可能需要自然语言处理和智能响应机制来提供良好的用户体验。"},{"prompt":"并给出适用场景的示例","completion":"确保我理解你的问题：你想要了解在AI系统或者大型模型中，\`systemmessage\` 和 \`HumanMessage\` 的区别，并希望获取一些具体场景的示例。以下是两种不同的消息类型及其适用场景的示例： 1. **systemmessage (系统消息):** 这些消息用于AI系统的内部操作，通常不直接面向用户。 **场景示例**: - **监控和警报**：假设AI系统负责监控本地数据中心的Server群。\`systemmessage\` 可能包含服务器温度超过阈值的自动警报、硬件故障的通知、或是维护窗口的开始和结束信息。这些消息可能会发送至一个集中的运维监控平台并触发自动或手动的响应过程。 - **性能日志**：在使用机器学习模型处理大批量数据的场景中，模型的训练进度、性能度量指标（如准确率、损失函数值）可能会被记录为\`systemmessage\`，并存储在日志文件中供后续分析。 - **异常报告**：一个自动交易系统可能使用AI预测股市趋势。如果系统检测到模型的行为偏离正常范围，会产生\`systemmessage\`来通知系统管理员进行检查和干预。 2. **HumanMessage (人类消息):** 这些消息面向用户，包括来自用户的输入或是系统对用户的响应。 **场景示例**: - **聊天机器人对话**：在零售公司的网站上，一个客户使用聊天窗口询问产品信息，客户的每条消息都是\`HumanMessage\`。AI系统解析这些消息并根据用户的查询提供回复。这里，用户的问题和系统的回答都被视为\`HumanMessage\`。 - **语音助手互动**：用户对其智能家居设备使用声控命令（如“打开厨房的灯”），这些命令是\`HumanMessage\`。AI系统识别命令并执行相应的动作，同时回复用户一条确认信息，如“已经打开厨房的灯”。 - **客户服务请求**：当顾客通过移动应用的帮助中心提交一个服务请求时，他们填写的表单或发送的文本消息就是\`HumanMessage\`。AI系统可能首先自动响应，尝试解答常见问题，或在必要时将请求转发给人类客服代表处理。 在设计系统时，两种消息类型需要通过不同的逻辑路径或服务来处理，以确保符合它们的用途。\`systemmessage\` 通常与系统管理员或运维团队相关，不会展示给终端用户；而 \`HumanMessage\` 直接涉及用户体验，需要采取用户友好、对话式交互的方法来管理。"},{"prompt":"choose a random popular animal, one word only","completion":"Dolphin"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsicalDolphin","completion":"Vibrant Ocean Life Artwork | Versatile Design for Mugs, Paintings, T-Shirts | Unique Marine Theme Decor and Apparel"},{"prompt":"Hi, are you really a gpt 4?","completion":"I am an AI language model, but I am not GPT-4 or any specific version.

Mark here. To answer your question: Yes, it is possible to display the screen of your Motorola moto g play (2023) with Android 12 on the Dell U2722DE monitor, but there are a few considerations to make sure it works correctly. The Dell U2722DE is a monitor equipped with USB Type-C connectivity that supports DisplayPort over USB-C. This means that the monitor can accept a video input via USB-C if the connected device supports video output through its USB-C port (also known as DisplayPort Alt Mode). The Motorola moto g play (2023) does feature a USB-C port, but not all devices support video output through this port. As an expert on the device, I would need to confirm whether the specific model of moto g play supports DisplayPort Alt Mode. Typically, this is a feature found on higher-end phones, and it's less common on budget-friendly models such as the moto g play series. If your Motorola moto g play supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, you can connect it directly to the Dell U2722DE using a USB-C cable that supports video transmission. If it doesn't support DisplayPort Alt Mode, your screen will not display on the monitor through this connection type. Alternatively, if the phone doesn't support video out via the USB-C port, you could explore wireless options such as Miracast or using a third-party app or hardware solution like a Chromecast, which would plug into the HDMI port on your monitor. The monitor’s USB-C with HDMI extension wouldn't be useful in this scenario since your phone doesn't output HDMI natively. In short, to display your phone's screen on your monitor using a C-type cable, your phone has to support video output through that port. Check the moto g play’s specs or consult with Motorola support to confirm if your device has this capability. Remember to ensure your USB-C cable is designed to handle video signals and that your monitor is set to the correct input. If all is compatible, you'll be able to extend or mirror your phone display onto the Dell U2722DE.

The urgency of the moment is a heavy reminder that in the world of Azur Lane, the line between victory and defeat is often drawn by how swift and how willing one is to support those who stand on the front lines."},{"prompt":"(Just outside the main Azur Lane base...)

The characters Enterprise and Vestal are shipgirls, personifications of World War II naval vessels. In Azur Lane, these shipgirls battle against mysterious foes known as the Sirens. Given the context: Enterprise appears to be in a situation where she or her companions are injured and in immediate need of healing, which is Vestal's role as a repair ship. Usually, Vestal would respond promptly, but her attention seems to be absorbed by a thorny rose in her hand, making her unresponsive to Enterprise's urgent calls. Vestal's words, \\"A flower, once withered, will not bloom again...a life, once lost, will not return...\\" suggest a moment of philosophical reflection or melancholy, quite atypical in the middle of what seems to be an emergency situation. This might imply that Vestal is under some sort of enchantment, experiencing a personal crisis, or perhaps contemplating a recent loss or a deeper aspect of the conflict at hand. Enterprise, known for her leadership and combat prowess, is typically calm under pressure but here is shown to be in a state of distress. Her repeated calls signify the urgency of the medical attention needed. If you wish to canonically continue this scenario in a manner true to the characters, it should involve a quick resolution to bring Vestal back to her senses. If Vestal is enchanted, this might involve a counter-spell or some sort of confrontation with an enemy. If it's an emotional moment, perhaps a close ally or a familiar event might snap her out of it. In the game, a common way to deal with a crisis situation is to deploy more shipgirls for support or find ways to reinforce the injured until help arrives. This non-canonical exchange could also be a starting point for a fan fiction, exploring the internal conflicts and struggles of shipgirls in the Azur Lane universe."},{"prompt":"(Just outside the main Azur Lane base...)

Although what you've described is not part of the official Azur Lane game or story as of my last update, it could be a dramatic and imaginative scenario created by a fan. In Azur Lane lore, Vestal is a repair ship known for her supportive abilities and is often seen providing repairs and medical attention to the other ships. It is very out of character for her to suddenly become ominous or menacing. Here's how a continuation of the scenario could be envisioned within the style of an interactive fanfiction or roleplay session: Enterprise, recognizing the shift in Vestal's demeanor, quickly moves to stand between her and the potentially threatening situation. Enterprise: \\"Vestal! This isn't you. Snap out of it! We don't harm the lives we've worked so hard to protect. Remember your oath as a repair ship of the Eagle Union.\\" Vestal, seemingly entranced, hesitates for a moment, the words seeming to echo somewhere deep within her. Vestal: \\"My oath... I— What have I...\\" Enterprise sees an opportunity and approaches cautiously, her voice soft but firm. Enterprise: \\"You've saved countless lives, Vestal; you're our anchor during the storm. Let's get back to base where we can sort this out. We'll fight to understand what's happened here, together.\\" The air holds a tense silence as Vestal looks at the rose in her hand, then back to Enterprise. A flicker of recognition crosses her face, and the menacing aura begins to fade. Vestal: \\"Enty... I—I don't know what came over me... Something... stirred within. I need help.\\" Enterprise nods, understanding and relief washing over her. She reaches out, taking Vestal's hand, ensuring she no longer feels alone. Enterprise: \\"It's alright. We've got you, Vestal. Let's head home.\\" As they make their way back to the main base, questions loom in the air—questions about the mysterious rose, the influence it had on Vestal, and what threats might now be lurking, unseen, poised to challenge the peace of Azur Lane. But for the moment, with the support of comrades, Vestal's immediate crisis seems averted, thanks to Enterprise's swift action and the strong bonds among the shipgirls. (The portrayed emotions and events in this piece are fictional and illustrative, aimed at providing a continuation to the scene you've started. In the official Azur Lane story, such events do not take place.)"},{"prompt":"(Just outside the main Azur Lane base...) Enterprise: \\"We need healing, Vestal! Vestal?!

Enterprise, a character based on the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier, is desperate for help, looking for her comrade, Vestal, to provide healing. Azur Lane, a game that combines naval warfare with anime-style characters representing warships, often includes dramatic moments like this. Vestal, in the game, represents the USS Vestal repair ship and serves as a healer among the fleet of personified ships. She is normally the source of comfort and a beacon of support during battles. However, in this fictional setup, Vestal seems to be emotionally detached and focused on the thorny rose in her hand, speaking philosophically about life and death. It's unclear why she is behaving this way, but she alludes to overdependence on others as a weakness and oddly declares the lives of the Sirens to be in her possession. The Sirens, in the context of Azur Lane, are the antagonists - a mysterious group that possess advanced technology and threaten the peace of the world. Vestal's claim about the lives of the Sirens being hers could mean several things. It could indicate a betrayal, where Vestal has somehow aligned herself with the Sirens, or perhaps she's discovered a way to turn their power against them. It could also be a sign of psychological stress or manipulation by a greater force that she's struggling to resist. Enterprise's reaction shows extreme concern for Vestal's well-being and confusion over her cryptic language. The urgency in her voice underscores the gravity of the situation, with potential implications not just for her and Vestal, but for their entire fleet. In order to resolve this tension, characters surrounding them will need to take swift action. This could involve approaching Vestal to understand her actions, providing immediate support to Enterprise who is seeking healing, and preparing for possible conflict should Vestal's words lead to a confrontation. It is important to note that this scenario is a creative interpretation and does not represent an actual event from the Azur Lane game. The game's storylines are typically less dramatic and focus more on the battle mechanics and character interactions within the context of the game's missions and events."},{"prompt":"(Just outside the main Azur Lane base...)

In your scenario, Enterprise, the Eagle Union (representative of the United States) aircraft carrier, is calling for assistance from the repair ship Vestal after a battle. However, Vestal appears to be lost in thought, fixated on a metaphor that compares the finality of life with a withered flower, possibly indicating a deeper internal conflict or a moment of philosophical realization. In this shift of tone, Vestal’s contemplative moment leads to an unexpected and ominous command to the ship Guam (likely another anthropomorphic ship girl in this scene), to open fire. This could suggest several plot twists, such as Vestal being influenced by an external force, developing a different perspective on the Sirens (the antagonists in Azur Lane), or experiencing a personal breakdown leading to a rogue decision.

Since your request appears to be large and complex, I'll address the main aspects and provide a high-level guidance on how to start with this task: # 1. Planning Your Implementation: Your first step should be to understand the assignment's requirements and to start designing your data structures. You need to think about how to implement posts, comments, and replies as linked structures, where each entity could have pointers to the next or possibly to its children (in the case of comments and replies). Create the header (\`*.h\`) and implementation (\`*.c\`) files for each component and define the data structures as structs. For example: \`\`\`c // post.h typedef struct Post { char *username; char *caption; struct Comment *comments; // This would be a linked list of comments struct Post *next; // For linking posts in a list } Post; // Similarly define Comment and Reply structures. \`\`\` # 2. Implementing Functions: Start implementing the functions specified for each ADT one by one, making sure to test them as you go to ensure correctness. Follow the prototypes given exactly - this is very important as your evaluation depends on it. For example, here is how you would begin a simple createPost function. \`\`\`c // post.c #include \\"post.h\\" #include <stdlib.h> Post *createPost(char* username, char* caption) { Post *newPost = (Post*) malloc(sizeof(Post)); if (newPost == NULL) { // Handle memory allocation error return NULL; } newPost->username = username; // Here consider deep copying strings if required newPost->caption = caption; newPost->comments = NULL; newPost->next = NULL; return newPost; } \`\`\` # 3. Global Instance: You are asked to have a global instance of the Platform, which is against typical practices but can be acceptable in the context of an assignment like this. Define the Platform as a global variable in the \`platform.c\` file and create functions to manipulate this global variable. # 4. Command Line Interface: Write your driver code in \`main.c\` to handle user input and direct to the correct operations. Use a loop to read commands and call the corresponding functions with the parameters provided by the user. # 5. Submission and Good Practices: Make sure to follow good coding practices. Your code should be well-organized into functions, with each ADT's functionality encapsulated in its specific \`.c\` and \`.h\` files. You will also create a \`Makefile\` to compile your project, and include a \`README.md\` with your assumptions and additional details. # 6. Practice Defensive Programming: Make sure to validate all inputs and handle errors gracefully. Since the grading involves a functionality test in addition to the code quality, your program must not crash due to unexpected inputs. # Reporting Back: After setting up the basic structure, implementing a few functions, and creating a simple CLI, you'd have established a solid base for your assignment. If you encounter specific issues while implementing a particular aspect of the task, you can come back with more targeted questions, and I'll be happy to assist you further. Good luck with your assignment!"},{"prompt":"Write viewpost function","completion":"Before writing the \`viewPost\` function, let's assume you've already defined the \`Post\` struct in your \`post.h\` and have a way to track a list of posts—whether via a linked list or an array. Here's a simplified example assuming an array of posts for the sake of simplicity. If you're using a linked list, you would need to iterate through the list to find the n-th post. \`\`\`c // Assuming MAX_POSTS is the maximum number of posts stored #define MAX_POSTS 100 // post.h typedef struct Post { char *username; char *caption; //... other members such as comments... } Post; // platform.h includes a global instance of Platform #include \\"post.h\\" typedef struct Platform { Post *posts[MAX_POSTS]; int post_count; Post *lastViewedPost; } Platform; extern Platform *globalPlatform; // This would be defined in platform.c // platform.c Platform *globalPlatform = NULL; // Initialize the global platform instance somewhere in your program void initializePlatform() { if (globalPlatform == NULL) { globalPlatform = (Platform *)malloc(sizeof(Platform)); globalPlatform->post_count = 0; // Initialize all post pointers to NULL for (int i = 0; i < MAX_POSTS; i++) { globalPlatform->posts[i] = NULL; } globalPlatform->lastViewedPost = NULL; } } // viewPost function Post *viewPost(int n) { if (n < 1 || n > globalPlatform->post_count) { printf(\\"Invalid post number.n\\"); return NULL; // Return NULL if n is out of bounds } Post *post = globalPlatform->posts[n - 1]; // Arrays are 0-indexed if (post == NULL) { printf(\\"Post does not exist.n\\"); return NULL; } // If post found, update lastViewedPost and return the post globalPlatform->lastViewedPost = post; return post; } \`\`\` Points to consider: - This example assumes you have a global variable \`globalPlatform\` of the type \`Platform\`, which contains an array of \`Post\` pointers. - The \`viewPost\` function takes an integer, \`n\`, representing the n-th most recent post you want to view. - The function returns a pointer to the \`Post\` if it exists or \`NULL\` if it isn't found or \`n\` is out of bounds. - After finding the post, it updates \`globalPlatform->lastViewedPost\` to the post that is being viewed. Adjust the code based on whether you are using a linked list or another data structure to store your posts. If using a linked list, replace the array logic with iteration over the list elements."},{"prompt":"(Just outside the main Azur Lane base...) Enterprise: \\"We need healing, Vestal! Vestal?!

Here are the steps you can take to resolve this issue: 1. **Downgrade Keras:** Downgrade the \`keras\` package to a compatible version within the range that \`tensorflow-intel\` requires. You can do so using \`pip\`: \`\`\`sh pip install keras==2.15.0 \`\`\` This should install the latest compatible version of \`keras\` that works with \`tensorflow-intel\` 2.15.0. 2. **Upgrade TensorFlow-Intel:** If you prefer to keep \`keras\` version 3.0.4, you may check if there is a more recent version of \`tensorflow-intel\` that supports \`keras\` 3.x. If such a version exists, you can upgrade: \`\`\`sh pip install --upgrade tensorflow-intel \`\`\` Before doing this, make sure to consult the documentation or release notes to see if a newer version is compatible with \`keras\` 3.0.4. 3. **Create a Virtual Environment:** If you need to work with multiple projects that require different dependencies, consider creating separate virtual environments for those projects. A virtual environment allows you to maintain separate sets of dependencies without conflicts: \`\`\`sh python -m venv my_project_env source my_project_env/bin/activate # On Windows, use my_project_envScriptsactivate \`\`\` After activating your virtual environment, you can install the specific versions of packages you need without affecting the global Python installation. 4. **Replace TensorFlow-Intel with Standard TensorFlow:** If you do not specifically require \`tensorflow-intel\`, you could consider switching to the standard \`tensorflow\` package, which might have updated compatibility with the newer \`keras\` version: \`\`\`sh pip uninstall tensorflow-intel pip install tensorflow \`\`\` 5. **Check for Other Conflicting Packages:** If there are other conflicting packages, consider updating them as well or creating an environment with compatible versions for all required packages. It's important to take note that each of these steps can affect your Python environment and installed packages, so consider the requirements of your project and other dependencies before making these changes."},{"prompt":"No module named 'tensorflow.keras'","completion":"The error message \`No module named 'tensorflow.keras'\` suggests that the \`tensorflow\` package is not installed in your Python environment or that it's not properly recognized. To resolve this issue, follow these steps: 1. **Ensure TensorFlow is installed:** First, make sure you have TensorFlow installed. You can install it with \`pip\` using the following command: \`\`\`sh pip install tensorflow \`\`\` If you require a specific version of TensorFlow, you can specify it like this: \`\`\`sh pip install tensorflow==2.x.x # Replace '2.x.x' with the desired version \`\`\` 2. **Verify the installation:** After installing TensorFlow, verify that you can import it without errors. Open a Python interpreter in your terminal or command prompt and try to import TensorFlow: \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf \`\`\` If there is no error message, the installation was successful. 3. **Check your import statement:** Make sure your import statement in your code reflects the correct TensorFlow structure. As of TensorFlow 2.x, you should be importing Keras modules as follows: \`\`\`python from tensorflow import keras \`\`\` or, if you need to access a specific submodule or function from \`keras\`: \`\`\`python from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense # and so on... \`\`\` 4. **Ensure you are in the correct environment:** If you're using a Python virtual environment, make sure it's activated before running your script or working with a Python interpreter. You can activate the environment with the following command: - On macOS and Linux: \`\`\`sh source /path/to/env/bin/activate \`\`\` - On Windows: \`\`\`cmd pathtoenvScriptsactivate \`\`\` 5. **Check for Environment Conflicts:** When you have multiple Python environments or versions installed (such as both Python 2 and Python 3), it's possible that \`pip\` is installing packages for a different version of Python than the one you're using to run your code. You can specify which version of \`pip\` to use like so: - For Python 2.x: \`\`\`sh pip2 install tensorflow \`\`\` - For Python 3.x: \`\`\`sh pip3 install tensorflow \`\`\` 6. **Restart your IDE or Terminal:** After installing or fixing module-related issues, you might need to restart your IDE or terminal to make sure it recognizes the changes. If you've gone through all these steps and still face issues, please provide more details, such as the specifics of how you're running your code and the complete error message, as there could be other reasons for the problem you're encountering."},{"prompt":"liste moi les points faibles et les points forts de ce rapport de stage: Rapport d’Apprentissage Développement WEB d’une base technique Anthony DUPORT Apprenti en 2ème année DUT Nathalie BROSSIER Tutrice Universitaire Bruno ROYER Luis CARVALHIDO Maîtres d’Apprentissages Châlette-sur-Loing Année 2019 - 2020 WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 2 Remerciements Tout d’abord, je remercie HUTHINSON de m’avoir accepté au sein de leur entreprise pendant un an en tant qu’apprenti Web Développeur.

Introduction : Durant mon DUT Informatique de 2 ans à l’Université d’Orléans, j’ai choisi de faire ma seconde année en apprentissage dans l’entreprise HUTCHINSON à Châlette- sur-Loing, plus précisément dans le département Eau partie Automobile. Mon alternance s’est déroulée du 2 septembre 2019 au 28 août 2020. Le rythme d’alternance était de 4 semaines à l’école, 4 semaines en entreprise puis totalement en entreprise à partir de juin. Durant cette année d’apprentissage, j’ai pu découvrir le monde de l’entreprise ainsi que différents corps de métier que je ne connaissais pas. De plus, j’ai pu mettre mes compétences acquises lors de mes années de DUT au service d’un projet concret que je détaillerai dans ce rapport. L’objectif de cet apprentissage était de continuer le développement d’un projet déjà existant, c’est-à-dire un site web regroupant des bases de données avec différents produits. L’objectif de celui-ci, nommé W4 pour Water World Wide Web Database, est de répertorier les produits du département pour que les données soient disponibles par les collaborateurs des autres pays, mises à jour en temps réel et accessible à tout moment. Dans ce rapport, je détaillerai tout d’abord l’entreprise HUTCHINSON, puis je présenterai le sujet de mon apprentissage ainsi que mon environnement de travail et le travail que j’ai effectué durant cette année. Enfin, je conclurai ce rapport par le bilan de cette année en apprentissage et ce qu’elle m’a apporté. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 6 II. L’entreprise : HUTCHINSON 1. Présentation Hutchinson est une entreprise qui fabrique des produits issus de la transformation du caoutchouc avec notamment des pneus de vélo ou encore des durites pour les voitures. Depuis plus de 160 ans, Hutchinson accompagne ses clients dans le monde entier grâce à son rayonnement international et son inventivité sur toutes les étapes du processus de production. Son slogan est « We make it possible ». En 2019, l’entreprise a fait 4.314 Milliards d’Euros de chiffre d’affaires. 2. Dates Clés En 1853, Hiram HUTCHINSON, un investisseur américain, créé une usine de caoutchouc à Châlette-sur-Loing dans une ancienne papeterie royal. Cette première usine conçoit des bottes en caoutchouc. En 1860, Hutchinson s’exporte à l’étranger en créant notamment des usines en Allemagne, en Espagne et en Italie. En 1900, l’entreprise se diversifie avec notamment la création de pneus de voiture et de vélo ainsi que des produits pour les airs comme des toiles pour les dirigeables. En 1974, Hutchinson est racheté par Total et devient donc une filiale du pétrolier. En 2013, toutes les entités Hutchinson sont rassemblées sous une marque commerciale unique avec notamment un nouveau logo. 1853 1860 1900 1974 2013 WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 7 3.

Département Eau Le département Eau fait partie de l’activité FMS (Fluid Management System). Les produits de cette activité servent à transporter les fluides (air, liquide de refroidissement, carburant, huile) du véhicule d’un organe à un autre. Voici l’organisation de l’activité FMS : RSO: Rubber System Operation MSO: Metal System Operation PSO: Plastic System Operation Le département FMS RSO Water est amené à concevoir et commercialiser des produits pour l’industrie automobile et est consulté par différents client pour divers produits. Les produits principalement conçus par ce service sont les durites et les moyens de connexion et d’assemblage associés. Voici un exemple d’un tuyau de refroidissement Peugeot : Clapet anti-retour Modulo Insert 3 voies Quick Connector FMS MSO RSO R&D Water R&D Air PSO WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 10 III. Présentation du sujet de travail 1. Introduction Durant cette année d’apprentissage, j’ai travaillé sur le projet W4 (Water World Wide Web Database) qui regroupe 5 bases de données cataloguant différents produits regroupés par pôle. Ce projet a été démarré en 2018 par deux stagiaires et continué l’année suivante par une apprentie et un stagiaire, tous de l’IUT d’Orléans. Voici les 5 pôles de W4 : Standart Coupling Quick Connectors Materials Components J’ai donc travaillé sur la base « Materials » (Matière) et la base « Components » (Composants), Composants étant ma mission principale. Les bases « Coupling » et « Standart » ont été développées en premier par les personnes citées ci-dessus. La base QC a été développée en amont par Luis CARVALHIDO qui nous a aidés durant ce projet. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 11 2. Description des produits a) La base Composants La base Composants regroupe les produits du management des fluides, c’est-à-dire les pièces permettant la gestion du flux à travers les différents circuits. Cette base est découpée en 3 catégories de produit :  Les inserts : ils permettent de diriger le flux dans un circuit ;  Les composants fonctionnels : Ce sont des inserts auxquels l’on ajoute une fonction. Par exemple, un clapet anti-retour permet de faire circuler le fluide que dans un sens ;  Les autres composants : Ce sont les composants qui se rajoutent aux inserts. Par exemple, une vis de purge qui viendra se visser ou encore un joint. Exemple de produits : Insert Composant Fonctionnel Autre Composant Insert composé de 5 voies Valve anti-retour Vis de purge Tous ces produits entrent dans le pôle du management thermique des fluides. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 12 b) La base Matière La base Matière regroupe les mélanges fait avec du caoutchouc qui servent à fabriquer les couches d’un tuyau. En effet, il est composé généralement de 3 couches :  Le fourreau : il permet de faire passer le liquide et de résister aux produits chimiques ;  Le tricot : il permet de résister à la pression et de limiter le gonflement et le fluage du caoutchouc. On peut le comparer au grillage métallique qui renforce les dalles en béton.  Le recouvrement : il protège les autres couches et résiste aux agressions venant de l’extérieur. Voici le schéma d’un standard expliquant les 3 couches : Ces 3 couches constituent la structure du tuyau, qui est appelé standard avant la vulcanisation (le fait de chauffer avec de la vapeur le produit pour lui donner une forme précise selon la demande du client). Cette base regroupera donc les différents mélanges constitués de caoutchouc permettant de fabriquer le fourreau et le recouvrement d’un standard. Recouvrement Fourreau Tricot WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 13 3. Fonctionnement avant W4 Avant le projet W4, l’ensemble des produits étaient stockés dans plusieurs fichiers Excel, qui était difficile de mettre à jour étant donné que la transmission de celui-ci se faisait par mail. a) Fichier base Composants Voici une vue du fichier de la base Composants : (Les données sont floutées pour des raisons de confidentialité) Une ligne correspond à un composant et une colonne correspond à une information (code, information technique, document, …). Ainsi, pour chaque modification, il fallait renvoyer le document à tous les utilisateurs pour qu’ils aient la version la plus à jour possible. Or, on peut déceler ici un problème de mise à jour si l’on n’envoie pas le fichier systématiquement que l’on le modifie. On peut voir aussi un problème aussi de doublons dû au copier-coller à l’intérieur du fichier. Par conséquent, deux utilisateurs pouvaient se retrouver avec 2 fichiers différents. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 14 b) Fichier base Matière Le fichier de la base matière est complexe. Une première page (ci-dessous) indique les caractéristiques techniques des mélanges : une ligne par mélange et une colonne par caractéristique comme le statut ou la densité. Les données sont floutées pour des raisons de confidentialité. Ensuite, il y a un onglet par mélange. Dans cet onglet, on retrouve les informations sur les sites de mélange mais aussi sur les clients qui sont homologués pour le couple mélange – site de mélange. En voici un exemple : WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 15 4. Expression minimale du besoin Il y a quelques années, une application Web a été développée pour répertorier les produits FMS QC (Quick Connectors). De ce fait, la division Eau a souhaité utiliser le même processus pour ses différents produits. C’est ainsi que le projet W4 a été créé par 2 stagiaires en 2018. Les principaux souhaits étaient donc d’avoir :  Des bases indépendantes regroupant chacune un catalogue avec des filtres permettant de rechercher un ou plusieurs produits ;  Des documents, avec notamment des fiches techniques ou des plans, disponibles et accessibles facilement ;  Des données qui sont mises à jour en temps réel pour savoir l’état des produits ainsi que leur statut ;  Un site disponible pour tous les collaborateurs dans le monde entier. 5. Fonctionnement du site Le site web du projet W4 est hébergé sur un serveur interne chez HUTCHINSON et est disponible par les collaborateurs du monde entier. Pour cela, il faut disposer d’un compte sur le site, puis demander les droits aux référents de chaque base car elles sont indépendantes les unes des autres. Voici la page d’accueil du site W4 : WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 16 Sur cette page, l’utilisateur peut choisir sur quelle base il veut se rendre pour ainsi accéder au catalogue si les droits en lecture lui ont été octroyés. Ensuite, il va pouvoir rechercher le produit qu’il souhaite grâce à une liste de filtres. IV. Environnement de développement 1. Environnement de travail Afin de réaliser au mieux ma mission, un bureau dans un « open-space » a été mis à ma disposition dans le bâtiment 901, où se trouve les futurs utilisateurs ainsi que les personnes qui développent les produits que contiendra W4. De plus, un ordinateur portable m’a été fourni afin de pouvoir me déplacer plus facilement pour poser des questions aux utilisateurs ou encore montrer et échanger à propos des interfaces. À mon arrivée, j’ai pu effectuer un plan de formation au sein du service FMS RSO Water afin de découvrir les métiers de chacun. Ainsi, cela m’a permis de mieux comprendre le travail des collègues avec qui je partage le service pour avoir une meilleure compréhension du sujet et des produits développés par le service FMS RSO Water. 2. Environnement Technique a) Langages de programmation Afin de réaliser cette application Web, les principaux langages de programmation utilisés sont :  Le HTML (HyperText Markup Language) est le langage permettant de structurer via des balises le contenu de page web ;  Le CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) vient s’additionner au HTML. Cet outil rassemble toutes les fonctionnalités pour décrire la présentation d’un document HTML. Il décrit la façon de disposer dans la page les éléments mais aussi tout ce qui est relatif à la couleur ou la taille ;  Le JS (JavaScript) permet de rendre une page dynamique via des animations et/ou la modification des éléments cités ci-dessus. En compléments de ces langages, le Framework Bootstrap a été utilisé afin de simplifier le design de l’application Web mais aussi jQuery pour la partie JavaScript et enfin amCharts pour ce qui est de la création de graphique. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 17 Les langages décrits ci-dessus sont les langages dits « coté client », qui sont interprétés par le navigateur web. Mais pour que les données soient dynamiques, il faut aussi des langages dits « coté serveur ». Le serveur va pouvoir consulter une base de données et renvoyer des données au format HTML. Voici donc les 2 langages utilisés :  Le PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) permet donc de créer des sites web dynamique mais aussi de se connecter à une base de données pour récupérer et afficher les données ;  MySQL (My Structured Query Language) est système de gestion de base de données relationnelles. Il permet de créer et d’administrer des bases de données. Tous les langages présentés sont « open-source » et sont mis à jour régulièrement par une large communauté d’utilisateurs et sont donc gratuit. b) Logiciels utilisés Pour pouvoir faire tourner un serveur Web sur mon ordinateur portable et pour ne pas travailler sur celui de production directement, il a été installé le logiciel XAMP. XAMP (X Apache MariaDB Perl PHP) est un ensemble de logiciels permettant de mettre en place un serveur Web rapidement avec notamment MySQL et le compilateur PHP. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 18 On peut voir sur cette interface qu’il est facile de gérer le serveur Apache ainsi que MySQL et de les démarrer ou les arrêter. De plus, pour pouvoir coder facilement, l’EDI (Environnement de Développement Intégré) NetBeans est utilisé. Il prend en charge différents langages de programmation notamment ceux utilisés dans le projet. Pour ce qui est de la gestion des bases de données MySQL, phpMyAdmin, qui est une interface graphique, permet de gérer rapidement et facilement les données du projet mais aussi de tester les requêtes. Enfin, pour pouvoir être à jour sur toutes les parties du projet, l’outil de versionnage GIT est utilisé via l’interface GitHub Desktop. Cela permet facilement de stocker le projet et de pouvoir partager les avancées avec les autres membres de celui-ci. Comme pour les langages, les logiciels cités sont « open-source » et donc gratuit. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 19 c) Outils de communication Pour communiquer, les outils Office 365 ont été mis à ma disposition avec une adresse mail professionnelle. Aussi, Teams a été un très bon outil car il était facile d’échanger avec les collègues à distance mais aussi de partager son écran lors de démonstration ou de présentation. V. Analyse du projet partie Composants 1. Objectifs de la base L’objectif principal de cette base est de référencer tous les produits ainsi que leurs spécificités techniques à travers un catalogue. Ce catalogue sera filtrable par une liste de filtres pour pouvoir rechercher précisément le produit que l’on souhaite. La plateforme devra aussi permettre d’ajouter et d’éditer un produit pour que le catalogue soit constamment à jour. Un utilisateur pourra aussi imprimer la fiche technique d’un produit et consulter les documents relatifs à celui-ci. La plateforme sera disponible dans le monde entier pour les utilisateurs qui sont à l’étranger. Ainsi, ils auront accès aux informations des différentes bases de données et les données seront mises à jour en temps réel. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 20 2. Analyse du besoin Voici le diagramme du besoin : Le but de la base est donc de faciliter la recherche et l’utilisation des données internes mais aussi de pouvoir être disponible n’importe où et n’importe quand pour les collaborateurs. 3. Principaux utilisateurs Voici le diagramme des utilisateurs : À qui le produit rend-il service ? Utilisateurs Hutchinson Sur quoi agit-il ? Organisation du flux d’informations Plateforme intranet Dans quel but existe-t-il ? Faciliter la recherche et l’utilisation des données internes Utilisateurs Pôle Produit Pôle Projet Pôle Marketing Pôle Liaison WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 21 a) Pôle produit Le pôle produit s’occupe de répondre aux RFQ (Request For Quotation, Demande de Devis) des différents clients et donc il doit connaître l’ensemble des produits qui peuvent être proposés. C’est pour cela qu’il faut que les produits soient à jour. b) Pôle marketing Le pôle marketing doit avoir une vision globale sur l’ensemble des produits qui sont développés par le service. Ainsi, il pourra savoir si les produits des concurrents sont meilleurs que ceux développés par le service (Benchmarking) et par conséquent pouvoir gagner les RFQ avec des produits performants. c) Pôle projet Ce pôle devra connaître les produits déjà développés afin de pouvoir en créer d’autre mais aussi innover et créer de nouveaux produits au regard de ceux déjà existant. d) Pôle liaison Le pôle liaison devra connaître les produits et plus particulièrement leurs spécificités techniques afin de créer des liaisons avec le tuyau en caoutchouc. Exemple de liaison (Coupling) Artifice de maintien Tuyau Embout WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 22 4. Droits Voici le tableau répertoriant les droits des utilisateurs : Outil d’administration L’utilisateur pourra utiliser les outils d’administration de la base Statistiques L’utilisateur pourra voir les statistiques relatives à la base Voir Catalogue L’utilisateur pourra regarder et filtrer le catalogue Voir détails L’utilisateur pourra regarder les données relatives à un produit Modifier les détails L’utilisateur pourra modifier les données d’un produit Créer un produit L’utilisateur pourra créer un nouveau produit Voir les documents L’utilisateur pourra voir et télécharger un document détaillant un produit Modifier les documents L’utilisateur pourra ajouter ou supprimer un document d’un produit Ainsi, chaque utilisateur aura une liste de droits défini par l’administrateur de la base. De plus, les droits seront mis en fonction de l’utilisateur et de l’utilisation qu’il aura. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 23 5. Contraintes Pour réaliser cette base, des contraintes ont été mises en place pour tout le projet et donc toutes les bases :  La langue utilisée devra être l’anglais : En effet, le projet W4 sera déployé dans le monde entier et il doit être compréhensible pour tous. C’est pour cela que l’anglais a été choisi comme langue par défaut ;  Un système de droits : Pour restreindre l’accès à des utilisateurs spécifiques mais aussi à certaines pages du site, un système de droit pour chaque base a été mis en place ;  Respect de la charte graphique HUTCHINSON : L’entreprise dispose d’une charte graphique bien spécifique avec notamment des logos et des couleurs qu’il faudra respecter lors du développement de la base. Une partie de celle-ci est disponible dans les annexes en page 41 ;  Homogénéisation des bases : Toutes les bases du projet W4 doivent être identiques au niveau des interfaces afin que l’utilisateur n’ait pas de difficultés en passant d’une base à l’autre. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 24 6. Grandes phases du projet Voici un diagramme représentant les grandes phases du projet : En effet, la première étape était de rédiger un cahier des charges en répondant aux besoins du projet, que ce soit pour la base Composants ou la base Matière. Ensuite, il a fallu faire des maquettes pour mettre en forme le fichier Excel au format d’une page web mais aussi valider les interfaces auprès des futurs utilisateurs. Après les maquettes, la conception d’une base fonctionnelle a été faite pour valider l’utilisation des interfaces lors de réunion d’avance. Enfin, la partie documentation est importante. Elle permet d’avoir un suivi du projet montrant comment il fonctionne pour simplifier l’éventuelle reprise par d’autres personnes. De plus, un manuel d’utilisateur est écrit pour faciliter l’utilisation de la base mais aussi pour pouvoir former les administrateurs et les utilisateurs et ainsi tirer pleinement profit de cet outil. Cahier des charges Maquettes Base Fonctionelle Documentation WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 25 7. Planning Voici le macro-planning avec les principales phases du projet : Le planning entier et détaillé se trouve dans les annexes en page 42. Tout d’abord, l’analyse est importante car elle permet de bien cerner le projet et ainsi de créer un cahier des charges. Ensuite, la conception relève de tout ce qui est création de la base de données mais aussi des premières maquettes à valider. Le développement permet de créer une base fonctionnelle et ainsi de faire tester à un nombre d’utilisateurs restreint le futur produit. Enfin, une phase de débogage et d’amélioration sera faite après le retour des utilisateurs qui auront testé la base. Aussi, il ne faut pas négliger la partie formation pour montrer aux administrateurs comment ajouter, supprimer ou modifier un produit. Afin de gérer au mieux ce projet, j’ai été amené à diriger des réunions d’avancement avec les différents pôles d’utilisateurs du projet (responsable des chefs produits, responsable des produits du management thermique, …). Ainsi, cela a permis de valider les fonctionnalités réalisées mais aussi de se questionner sur la future utilisation de la base et l’ajout de fonctionnalités comme un lien vers d’autres bases par exemple. Analyse Conception Developement Débogage et formation Novembre Décembre Février Juin Août WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 26 VI. Développement 1. Introduction Lors de mon arrivée sur le projet W4 en octobre 2019, Michael m’a montré le fonctionnement général du site et des bases pour que je comprenne le fonctionnement. Ainsi, j’ai pu voir le code et comment les choses étaient faites pour pouvoir développer plus facilement. 2. Général : Modification de la barre de navigation Lorsque l’on est sur une base de W4, une barre de navigation est présente. Elle permet de pouvoir basculer d’une base à un autre mais aussi d’accéder aux onglets propres d’une base. Voici une capture d’écran de celle-ci : Lorsque l’on passe la souris sur l’icône un sous menu apparaît différent pour chaque base : Base Standart Base Liaison Base Matière Voici donc un aperçu lorsque l’on est sur la base Composants et que l’on passe la souris sur l’icône : J’ai donc fait un ajustement sur cette fonctionnalité car il y avait un dysfonctionnement lorsque l’on passait la souris à côté de l’icône, le menu ne se déroulait pas. J’ai utilisé du CSS pour faire cela. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 27 3. Base Composants a) Catalogue Voici l’affichage général du catalogue : Cette page est composée de 2 parties :  Une liste de filtres : Elle permet de pouvoir affiner la recherche d’un composant simplement en sélectionnant les caractéristiques du composant que l’on souhaite ;  Une liste de composants : C’est ici que seront affichés les résultats de la recherche avec une prévisualisation des informations. Liste de filtres Liste de composants WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 28 b) Modélisation de la base de données de la base Composants Cette partie du projet, la base Composant, avait été commencée par Michael en mai 2019. Une ébauche d’analyse et de base de données avait été faite. Voici la modélisation de la base de données faite par Michael : Pour m’approprier de la meilleure façon le sujet mais aussi car l’analyse et le schéma avaient été fait 5 mois avant, j’ai décidé de repartir à zéro. J’ai donc refait une modélisation de la base de données à partir du fichier Excel. La voici : WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 29 Je suis donc allé voir Luis pour en discuter. C’est alors que nous avons fait un autre schéma de la base de données à partir du même fichier Excel : Ce schéma est à retrouver dans les annexes en page 43. En comparant ces deux schémas, on peut voir que le dernier est meilleur que celui que j’avais fait seul. En effet, Luis, par son expérience et son habitude, m’a fait remarquer que ma modélisation n’était pas adaptée : si l’on veut rajouter des informations comme par exemple un code ou une caractéristique technique. Cela se fait facilement via la nouvelle base de données ce qui aurait été plus compliqué sur mon modèle. Cela m’a fait donc changer ma façon de penser afin de pouvoir, par la suite, anticiper des éventuels changements plus facilement. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 30 c) Filtres du catalogue de la base Composants Comme vu dans l’analyse de cette base, une fonctionnalité permettant de filtrer les produits doit être disponible pour la base. Lors de la sélection d’un filtre, la liste de filtres doit se remettre à jour. Voici donc la liste des filtres : Par exemple, lorsqu’un utilisateur va venir sélectionner un client, tous les autres filtres vont se mettre à jour suivant les produits liés au client. Ainsi, il est facile de faire une recherche et de trouver le produit associé. Si lorsque l’utilisateur qui a recherché un produit selon ses critères n’en a pas trouvé, il pourra en discuter avec le responsable de la base. Ils pourront trouver une solution en voyant quels produits s’en rapprochent le plus ou encore en créant un nouveau produit si nécessaire. Pour effectuer cette mise à jour lors de la sélection, j’ai repris ce qui avait été fait pour les autres bases. J’ai donc utilisé du AJAX (JavaScript et XML asynchrones). Cette méthode permet de recharger une partie d’une page HTML sans avoir à réactualiser toute la page. Ainsi, la mise à jour sera rapide et visuellement satisfaisant (la page ne se recharge pas). WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 31 d) Catalogue de la base Composants Lors de la recherche via les filtres, une liste de composants en adéquation avec sa recherche va s’afficher. Elle permet d’avoir une première vue sur le produit avec quelques informations pour savoir si le produit cherché est le bon. Lorsque l’utilisateur va venir cliquer sur le produit, une nouvelle page va s’afficher avec le détail complet de celui-ci. Elle sera détaillée dans la suite. Voici une capture d’écran de la vue du catalogue : Pour mieux voir l’image d’un produit, il a été demandé d’ajouter un « zoom » lors du passage de la souris sur l’image d’un composant. Cela permet de ne pas avoir à aller sur la page suivante pour mieux voir l’image. J’ai donc réalisé cette fonctionnalité grâce à l’attribut CSS « scale » qui permet de grossir ou de rétrécir un élément HTML. À droite on retrouve la capture d’écran normal sans zoom et à gauche celle où il y a le zoom. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 32 e) Page détails de la base Composants Cette page est donc la page où l’on vient retrouver les détails d’un composant ainsi que les documents qui lui sont associés. Il est demandé d’avoir les mêmes interfaces sur les pages de W4. Voici donc un exemple pour la base Liaison : J’ai donc repris le format ainsi que les couleurs car les bases de W4 doivent être homogènes. Voici le résultat pour la base Composants : WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 33 Sur la partie gauche de la page, on peut retrouver les documents relatifs au composant. Il suffit de cliquer sur le document pour le télécharger si l’utilisateur en a le droit. Sur la partie de droite, on retrouve les caractéristiques techniques mais aussi des informations générales sur le produit. Aussi, dans le dernier tableau, on retrouve les composants qui sont présents sur le produit comme par exemple un bouchon de purge. On peut retrouver l’historique des modifications en cliquant sur cette icône : Une fenêtre apparaît avec les informations des modifications. Voici un exemple : f) Page de modification Cette page permet de mettre à jour facilement un composant en venant modifier directement les informations. On peut aussi changer l’image ou encore rajouter des documents. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 34 g) Page d’ajout L’interface pour ajouter un composant est identique à la page de modification. Voici la capture d’écran pour cette page : L’utilisateur vient renseigner les informations dont il dispose. Il peut aussi ajouter des documents et une photo du produit. h) Page des statistiques Des statistiques ont été mises en place dans toutes les bases de W4 pour ainsi savoir le nombre de personnes qui consultent les pages ou encore le nombre de produits par statuts. Pour créer et afficher les graphiques, la bibliothèque amCharts est utilisée. Il suffit de lui fournir des données via JavaScript et les informations sont affichées suivant le modèle choisit sur le site d’amCharts. Voici un exemple : WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 35 4. Base Matière a) Catalogue Voici l’affichage général du catalogue : Cette page est composée d’une liste de filtres et d’une liste de mélanges, comme sur les autres bases de W4. b) Modélisation de la base de données de la base Matière Cette partie du projet, la base Matière, était nouvelle donc aucune ébauche de la base de données n’avait été faite. J’ai donc fait le schéma suivant : Ce schéma est à retrouver dans les annexes en page 44. Liste de filtres Liste des mélanges WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 36 c) Filtres du catalogue de la base Matière Voici la liste des filtres : ➔ Nom du mélange ; ➔ Site de mélange ; ➔ Client ; ➔ Spécification du client ; ➔ Classe de température maximal ; ➔ Résistance à la traction ; ➔ Allongement à la rupture ; ➔ Résistivité volumique. Ces filtres sont gérés de la même façon que pour la base Composants. d) Vue Technique Cette page permet d’avoir les caractéristiques techniques d’un mélange mais aussi d’avoir les informations d’un client par rapport à un site de mélange. On peut ensuite cliquer sur le site de mélange pour avoir le détail des clients et des spécifications. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 37 e) Vue mélange – site de mélange Sur cette vue, on retrouve les informations relatives au couple mélange – site de mélange. Voici une capture d’écran comme exemple : En première partie sont indiqués les informations du site de mélange avec notamment le DDM (Dossier de Définition du Mélange) qui est le document avec toutes les informations sur le couple mélange – site de mélange. Ensuite, on retrouve un tableau contenant les différents clients avec leur spécification associé. Puis pour chaque couple client – spécification, différents documents sont disponibles en fonction du statut du mélange. f) Modification des données mélange – site de mélange Voici l’interface pour modifier les données : WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 38 Lors de l’ajout d’un nouveau client, il faut d’abord le sélectionner. Une fois celui-ci sélectionné, la liste des spécifications se met à jour en fonction du client pour faciliter la recherche de la spécification voulue. Une requête est faite en JavaScript pour connaître les spécifications et elles sont ensuite ajoutées au menu déroulant. g) Insertion d’un mélange L’ajout d’un mélange se fait en deux parties : il faut d’abord renseigner les données techniques et ensuite remplir la partie du site de référence du mélange. Voici l’interface pour les données techniques : Ici, l’interface pour le site de référence du mélange : L’ajout d’un client s’effectue comme pour l’édition : la liste des spécifications se met à jour en fonction du client sélectionné. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 39 VII. Difficultés et problèmes rencontrés 1. Version PHP Il y a une différence de version PHP entre mon ordinateur et le serveur de production. En effet, sur ma machine c’est la version 7.3.9 alors que sur le serveur c’est la version 5. Il a donc fallu à faire attention aux fonctions utilisées pour qu’elles soient compatibles avec le serveur de production. 2. JavaScript À mon arrivée sur le projet, je ne connaissais pas techniquement le langage JavaScript, nous ne l’avions pas encore vu en cours à L’IUT. J’ai donc recherché de la documentation sur Internet et j’ai demandé des conseils à Luis et Michael afin de me former à ce langage. 3. Panne Informatique Au début de l’année 2020, une panne informatique a touché le réseau informatique d’Hutchinson. Cela a eu pour conséquence de ne plus pouvoir accéder au serveur de production pour consulter le site ou faire des mises à jour mais aussi au serveur local où étaient sauvegardés les fichiers. De plus, avec Michael, nous n’avions plus accès à GIT donc nous faisions nos modifications en local sans pouvoir mettre à jour les avancées de chacun. WATER WORLD WIDE WEB DATABASE ANTHONY DUPORT – RAPPORT D’APPRENTISSAGE – 2019-2020 40 VIII. Bilan Pour conclure sur cette année d’apprentissage, elle a été enrichissante sur plusieurs points que je vais détailler ci-après. Tout d’abord, j’ai pu découvrir le monde de l’entreprise et ainsi avoir une expérience de travail avec différentes personnes sur un même projet. J’ai donc travaillé avec différents corps de métier que j’ai pu comprendre grâce au plan de formation quand je suis arrivé. J’ai été aussi amené à travailler en équipe avec Michael ou encore les utilisateurs. De plus, j’ai participé au développement d’un projet concret qui servira à différents utilisateurs et partout dans le monde. J’ai donc pu acquérir des compétences de conception et d’analyse, grâce à Luis CARVALHIDO et son expérience, car il fallait penser aux éventuelles améliorations qui seront faites notamment pour la base de données. Ensuite, j’ai pu continuer à développer mes compétences humaines en gestion de projet notamment mais aussi techniques que j’ai acquises durant ma formation à l’IUT. J’ai aussi appris à améliorer ma communication avec mes collègues. Enfin, je pourrai continuer à travailler sur le projet W4 ainsi que sur d’autres dans la suite de mes études, en tant qu’Apprenti Ingénieur des Systèmes d’Information à l’Université de Technologie de Belfort Montbéliard (UTBM) pour une durée de 3 ans.

However, if it's not working, there could be a few reasons behind this. Here's a checklist to troubleshoot and potentially fix the issue: 1. **DNS Resolution**: Confirm that the domain \`www.tuito.api.sebastien-gratade.fr\` properly resolves to the server's IP address. 2. **Nginx Configuration Syntax**: Use \`nginx -t\` to test the configuration syntax. 3. **Configuration Link**: Make sure that the server block configuration file for \`www.tuito.api.sebastien-gratade.fr\` is linked to the \`sites-enabled\` directory if you are using a structure with \`sites-available\` and \`sites-enabled\`. 4. **Nginx Reload**: After any changes, reload Nginx to apply the configuration: \`\`\`sh sudo nginx -s reload \`\`\` 5. **Firewall Settings**: Ensure that the firewall is not blocking port 8080. 6. **Application Status**: Verify that the application is running on \`localhost:8080\`. You can test this by using \`curl\` from the server itself: \`\`\`sh curl http://localhost:8080 \`\`\` 7. **Nginx Logs**: Check Nginx error logs for more detailed information about what might be going wrong. \`\`\`sh sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log \`\`\` 8. **Upstream Service**: Ensure the upstream service (the app on port 8080) is correctly configured to accept connections from localhost and is not bound to another interface. 9. **Server Block Configuration**: Review the configuration for potential conflicts with other server blocks.

Confusion washes over Enterprise as she watches the sisterly figure transform into something unrecognizable, brandishing firepower with a determination so cold it chills her to the bone. By the time Vestal is done with her furious onslaught, the Sirens in her path lay in ruins, testament to a resolve forged from something beyond her usual caring nature.)

In your narrative, one of the characters, Vestal, traditionally known for her role as a repair ship and healer, takes a drastic turn, becoming a fighter to meet the growing threats of the Sirens head-on. This transformation into Vestal META seems to be a nod to the concept of a \\"META\\" ship, which in the context of Azur Lane, refers to a powerful alternate version of a ship that has been enhanced through Siren technology. These META ships are typically stronger and exhibit different abilities compared to their standard counterparts. Enterprise's reaction to Vestal's change reflects the challenges and dynamics of characters expanding beyond their initial roles, confronting the reality of war, and the need to adapt to ensure survival and victory. Vestal's shift in character, from a nurturing healer to a formidable warrior, is a thematic element that involves character growth and the resolve to face challenges head-on, often seen in storytelling within gaming and anime alike. Your narrative encapsulates the essence of character development and the struggle between one's identity and adapting to what circumstances demand. It is a powerful reminder that even in fictional worlds like that of Azur Lane, characters are envisioned with complex emotions and growth, continuously evolving to face the threats and trials that come their way."},{"prompt":"# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding # of Nginx configuration files in order to fully unleash the power of Nginx. # https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/ # https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/config_pitfalls/ # https://wiki.debian.org/Nginx/DirectoryStructure # # In most cases, administrators will remove this file from sites-enabled/ and # leave it as reference inside of sites-available where it will continue to be # updated by the nginx packaging team. # # This file will automatically load configuration files provided by other # applications, such as Drupal or Wordpress.

It's made with coconut, sugar, and milk or condensed milk, with cardamom adding a hint of flavor that complements the sweet coconut beautifully. Here is a step-by-step recipe to make delicious coconut burfi: # Ingredients: - 3 cups of freshly grated coconut or desiccated coconut (if using desiccated, make sure it's unsweetened) - 1.5 cups of granulated sugar (adjust to taste) - 1 cup of milk or 1/2 cup of condensed milk (if using condensed milk, adjust sugar accordingly as it's already sweet) - 1/2 cup of water (if not using condensed milk) - 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom powder - 1 tablespoon of ghee (clarified butter) plus more for greasing - A few strands of saffron (optional) - Chopped nuts like almonds or pistachios for garnishing (optional) # Instructions: 1. Grease a flat tray or plate with a little ghee and set aside. 2. In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat 1 tablespoon of ghee over medium heat. 3. Add in the grated coconut and sauté it for a couple of minutes until you get a nice aroma, but make sure not to brown it. 4. If you're using milk, add it now and bring the mixture to a simmer. Let it cook down until the milk is mostly absorbed. 5. Add in the sugar and water (only if you haven't used condensed milk). If using condensed milk, add it now and skip the water. Stir continuously to prevent the mixture from sticking to the pan. 6. Keep cooking the mixture on medium heat, stirring often, until the mixture starts to thicken and begins to leave the sides of the pan. This might take around 15-20 minutes. 7. Add the cardamom powder and saffron strands, if using. Mix well. 8. Once the mixture becomes thick and starts to form a dough-like consistency, and you can see ghee separating from the mixture, it's ready to be set. 9. Pour the mixture onto the greased tray and spread it evenly with a spatula. 10. While it's still warm, cut into desired shapes (usually squares or diamonds). 11. Garnish with chopped nuts, if you like, pressing them slightly into the burfi to stick. 12. Allow it to cool down completely. Once it's cooled, the burfi will harden and can be removed from the tray. 13. Store the coconut burfi in an airtight container. It should last up to a week at room temperature or longer if refrigerated. Enjoy the delightful sweetness and rich flavor of freshly made coconut burfi!"},{"prompt":"(Just outside the main Azur Lane base…) Enterprise: “Sheffield! You’re injured!

We can’t have her thinking she can jump right back into the fray.” Enterprise: “Understood. I’ll make sure to convey the message to her. But you know as well as I do that it'll be tough to keep Sheffield from trying to return to her duties prematurely.” Vestal: “Indeed. In any case, I will continue to monitor her condition closely. But for now, let's let her rest. We'll need to coordinate with the rest of the fleet to cover her responsibilities in the meantime. Communication will be essential to ensure that no role is left unattended.” Enterprise: “I'll handle the coordination. I’ll also speak with the leaders of the other factions to ensure they’re informed of our current status.

With the unity and strength of our fleet, we can overcome any challenge. For now, let Sheffield’s bravery be a reminder to us all of the importance of balancing duty with self-care.” Enterprise nods: “I’ll pass on our conversation to the Commander as well. It’s important that they're kept in the loop about any changes to our operational capacity.” Vestal: “Please do. And Enterprise, take a moment for yourself as well. You’ve been working tirelessly.” Enterprise: “I appreciate your concern, but there’s much to be done. I promise to rest once I've ensured that Sheffield is being looked after and that the fleet remains secure.

Story meets Europe; a scene reminiscent of Steve Martin's musings on excessive, ridiculous coffee preferences from his satirical 1991 film. Imagine the French, for example, consuming triple-shot2 soy milk lattes, the Italians downing3 almond mocha espressos, or perhaps the Swiss insisting upon half-caf skimmed macciattos? It seems unlikely to some, but it may become a real possibility. That's because European nations, including Italy, which introduced the coffeehouse to the world more than 400 years ago, now face an American challenge to this treasured4, and once unique, institution. The Seattle-based coffee powerhouse, Starbucks, has announced plans to expand5 its 4,000-strong empire with some 650 branches6 planned for continental Europe. Starbucks is currently opening new branches worldwide at a rate of three per day. \\"We're taking a softly, softly7 approach when it comes to Europe,\\" explained a spokeswoman for Starbucks Europe. \\"We expect to open shops in the big four countries, Italy, Germany, France and Spain in the next 24 to 36 months.\\" The company has had branches for some time outside of the United States, in places as far and wide as Thailand, Dubai, and Saudi Arabia. In many of these countries, Starbucks coffee struck8 its customers as being exotic, enticing, and addictive. The Japanese are particularly addicted to the American import, with over 200 outlets serving customers throughout the country. But now, Starbucks is attempting to encroach upon9 what Europe considers its own pride and joy10, something not to be challenged by outside imitators. In Italy, where one city has already formed an association to protect historic cafés, a battle lies ahead. For Italians, drinking their coffee is as routine as breathing, a recent survey11 found that 70 million cups of espresso are drunk in Italy each year. That's 600 shots per person, consumed in any of Italy's 110,000 coffee bars. Milan, nexus of the fashion world, has some 600 cafés alone. And Italians' cafés are a source of pride and joy. In this country where sidewalk12 cafés are firmly entrenched13 in the national psyche, Starbucks' announcement has caused an uproar14. \\"The Italian café is a culture that the Americans have repackaged15,\\" said a spokesman for one of Starbucks' European competitors. \\"They concentrate more on their image than the coffee.\\" Italy's La Stampa newspaper said: \\"We thought we had everything in Italy, but it turns out we lacked16 one thing: American coffee,\\" It's not Starbucks' first foray17 into the European market. Just three years ago, the first Starbucks was opened at Britain's Manchester Airport. There are now 200 stores in this country alone, with plans for an additional 140 outlets to open in the next two years. But on the Continent, Starbucks may have a formidable challenge. Europeans like their coffee plain18 and simple; the Starbucks’ tradition of customized19, high-maintenance coffees just may not work in continental Europe. Though Europeans may choose espressos instead of cappuccinos, having a coffee is a treasured break20, or perhaps a leisurely start, for one's day. One Swiss newspaper writer dismissed21 Starbucks as \\"coffee culture in a cardboard cup.\\" Yet Starbucks has already ventured into Switzerland, where its three-storied Zurich shop attracts customers in one of 50 outlets planned for the alpine country. In fact, “The firm22 views Switzerland as a great test for continental Europe because of the multi-cultural nature of the city,\\" said the Starbucks Europe spokeswoman. American coffee, à la Starbucks and other imitators, has been criticized for being weak and commercialized23. But the company insists it has been welcomed with open arms on the Continent. And surprisingly, some European competitors grudgingly credit Starbucks with opening the doors to Europe's espresso bar market. \\"The Europeans, in particular, are quite pleasantly surprised when they taste Starbucks for the first time,\\" Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz told the press recently, \\"because American coffee has had a bad reputation for so long.\\" The company maintains that it is taking into account24 the local influences of the new Starbucks countries. Though the company owns almost all of its stores in the States, Starbucks finds local business partners in most foreign markets. And while it doesn't change its coffee offerings, the food choices are adapted to local cultures. \\"We don't believe we are an American company, but an international brand,\\" Howard Behar, president of Starbucks Coffee International recent told the BBC. In Britain, Starbucks hopes to use the national pub culture to make Starbucks another meeting place, he added. But Starbucks' challenge will not only be its ability to open and maintain branches world-wide, but to overturn25 decades, if not centuries, of tradition. Coffee is already currently the second largest traded commodity in the world, just after oil. With Starbucks pushing into newer territories faster than it can come up with new coffee variations, this trend looks set to continue WRITE T or F ON THE ANSWER SHEET PROVIDED 26 Everyone agrees that Starbucks will change the nature of coffee drinking on the European continent. 27 Starbuck’s has a global ‘empire’ of 650 branches. 28 This is not Starbucks’ first venture outside of the US. 29 The survey found that, on average, Italians drink 600 coffees per person per year. 30 However, Italian cafés are not seen as culturally different to Starbucks’ cafés. 31 La Stampa newspaper said that Italy should have American coffee. 32 By 2018 there will be 140 Starbucks’ outlets in the UK. 33 Starbucks like to customize their coffee as much as possible. 34 Starbucks has not proved successful in Switzerland due to the multi-ethnicity of that country. 35 Outside of America Starbucks usually operates in a joint venture.","completion":"26 F 27 F 28 T 29 T 30 F 31 F 32 T 33 T 34 F 35 T"},{"prompt":"We can find early forms of capitalism in Rome and the original Arabic empires of 'early history'. The men and women who sold sell to others for a profit were called 'mercantilists'. They purchased goods from one group or tribe and sold them to another. They were, what today we would call ‘middlemen’. In providing this service they earned a surplus, by selling for more than they had paid. As the Roman Empire expanded so did trade for profit. However, the Roman Empire began to contract in the 4th century AD and so did trade with other countries. By the 700s most societies looked inwards for their trade and supplies of essentials. Decide if these statements are true or false: 1 Capitalism is a modern activity. 2 ‘Mercantilists’ didn’t produce the products they sold. 3 Trade in the Roman empire expanded and contracted with the rise and fall of the empire. 4 By the 700s European trade was less international than before.","completion":"1 F 2 T 3 T 4 T"},{"prompt":"In contrast to this the Arabic empires traded vast distances. The trade routes connected three Arab empires, namely Egypt, Persia (mainly modern Iran and Iraq) and later Byzantium (modern Turkey). The 'Jihads', or religious wars, of the seventh century spread Islam into Northern Africa, Spain, the Middle East and Asia (including modern India). The ability to trade grew with this expansion and great wealth was accumulated in this period. The medieval Europeans learned trading from their Islamic neighbours. Examples of this are the words tariff and traffic, which are Arabic terms. From around the 1300s Europeans started to expand their trading activities. Adventurers and explorers set out on voyages of discovery which captured the imagination of a new 'class' or group, the merchants. As the ability of these adventurers improved there was an increase in trade routes and trade and the term 'capitalism' started to emerge. This capitalism was based on the same principles as mercantilism, making profit by buying goods at a lower price and then selling them for a higher price Decide if these statements are true or false: 5 Arabic countries traded over great distances. 6 The Arabic military conquests took Islam also into Europe. 7 Arabic countries only traded with other Arabic countries. 8 Arabic traders learnt from the European traders. 9 An early definition of ‘capitalism’ was, those who made money from buying a lot of products at a lower price than what they were eventually sold for.","completion":"5 T 6 T 7 F 8 F 9 T"},{"prompt":"10 Capitalism has several powerful characteristics.

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. The returning woman blurts out an ominous warning. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief while confusingly muttering to herself about things feeling warm and heavy, and then, after a brief pause to softly grunt, she continues to murmur about how much it stinks. The perplexed present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern and asks what stinks, while the returning woman continues to softly grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air with a perplexed expression. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman inquires about the odor again, describing what it smells like. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, what had actually just happened dawns upon her. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman sniffs nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks if the source of the odor is the returning woman having pooped in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so dirty like pooping in her pants is unbelievably disgusting. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and childishly finished pooping in her pants once she began. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and finish pooping in her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to poop and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where the returning woman had to make the decision to finish pooping in her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally poop, even if it ended up happening inside her pants. In response to the returning woman's comments, the present woman expresses her disgust and tauntingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty, because it seems to the present woman that the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when the returning woman speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman verbally demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's relieving deed. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect the returning woman's rear end. The present woman proceeds to chidingly ridicule the returning woman over the sight of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants. Then, the present woman continues to taunt the returning woman at length by expressing disappointed astonishment over how full the returning woman's pants are, by describing the visual appearance of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants, and by expressing disgust at the amount of poop that is in the returning woman's pants. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full not because of special intention on the returning woman's part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. The returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. * In response, the present woman exclaims with with scornful disgust that it is obvious how full the returning woman's stomach was because of this massive dump that the returning woman has taken in her pants. Then, the present woman tauntingly remarks that because it looked like the returning woman was feeling good as she was taking this massive dump, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman childishly enjoys not only relieving herself in her pants, but also having her pants be so full and loaded. The present woman adds that it is not only the full and loaded pants that the returning woman probably enjoys, but also this terrible odor that is emanating from the soiled pants too. * As she is inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants and chiding her, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she adds in coy resignation that given the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by taunting the returning woman over how pungent the odor that emanates from the returning woman's pants is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because an odor that pungent is unbearable. After that, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while verbally imploring the returning woman not to drop any of her pants’ contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom. While escorting the returning woman, the present woman is continues to react to the odor and disgustedly assists the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the odor that is emanating from the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing while reacting to her own odor. In addition, the returning woman voices her concern that the deposit is spreading inside her pants because of the motion of walking towards the bathroom. In response, the present woman reinforces her grip that is intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman’s pants. As she is reinforcing her grip, the present woman continues to complain about the the returning woman’s odor. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom’s threshold instead of entering, coyly mentioning that it feels very messy and icky inside her pants, and asking the present woman if she would like to change the her “poopy diaper”. As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grip on the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few more seconds to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about the odor from the returning woman’s soiled pants.","completion":"Title: \\"The Unplanned Homecoming\\" INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – EARLY AFTERNOON The hallway is calm, dimly lit by wall sconces, and flanked with potted plants. MARIBEL MORALES (early 20s, energetic Mexican-American, with wavy brown hair tied into a high ponytail, wearing a loose-fitting blouse and culottes, sensible flats) hurries down the corridor. She fidgets, her face a mask of discomfort and urgency - clearly, her body is sounding alarms. BACKGROUND: Earlier, during a lengthy dedication ceremony at a community center, Maribel, having drunk several cups of herbal tea, didn't use the restroom beforehand due to the expectation the event would be brief. Contrary to her expectations, it dragged on. Now, Maribel struggles after barely surviving the bus ride home without a restroom break. Maribel approaches her family’s apartment door. Her swiftness turns to panic as she pats her pockets, realizing her house key is missing. Desperation peaks; her face twists in anguish. MARIBEL (whispering to herself) Oh, please, no. Not now. She frantically knocks on the door, each thump echoing her internal distress. INT. APARTMENT – CONTINUOUS Through the peephole, a faint silhouette is visible. It's MARIA MORALES (late 40s, Mexican-American, nurturing but no-nonsense, with streaks of gray in her chestnut hair, wearing comfortable home attire). Suddenly, Maria's concerned voice calls out from the other side. MARIA (apartamento voice) ¿Quién es? ¿Qué pasa? MARIBEL (slightly stuttering) M-Mamá, soy yo, rápido, por favor. INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS Sounds of multiple locks disengaging break the silence, but not swiftly enough for Maribel, who's close to the breaking point. MARIBEL (clenching her stomach) Mamá, por favor, ¡date prisa! The door swings open, revealing Maria. She is alarmed by Maribel’s unusual behavior. MARIA (concerned) Hija, ¿qué sucede? MARIBEL (urgent, shuffling past Maria) Mamá, moverte, tengo que entrar. Maria instinctively grabs Maribel by the arm, her face creased by worry. MARIA (grabbing Maribel) Espera, calma, dime qué pasa. MARIBEL (pleading, trying to wriggle free) ¡Ay, mamá, no hay tiempo! The bickering intensifies, the physical struggle apparent as Maria inadvertently blocks Maribel, yet her concern blocks her clarity. MARIBEL (not directly admitting her urgency) ¡Déjame pasar o va a pasar algo muy malo! MARIA (trying to understand) ¡Pero si no me dices, cómo te voy a ayudar! INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY – CONTINUOUS Maribel's face morphs from panic to shock; an ominous groan escapes her lips, swallowed by Maria's bewildered gaze. MARIA (releasing her grip, baffled) ¿Qué tienes, hija? Maribel steps back, receding into a careful squat, her motions unusually measured. Maria watches in disbelief as Maribel grunts and, with an expression intermingling effort and relief, begins to soil herself. Her mother's confusion deepens. MARIA (perplex) Hija, ¿pero qué haces? MARIBEL (strained, almost content) Mamá, no sabes qué alivio... Maria's concern persists, probing for understanding. MARIA (perplex) ¿Estás bien? ¿Qué pasa contigo? MARIBEL (soft grunts, satisfaction in her voice) Ay... está calientito... y pesado. Ugh, qué olor... Maria's expression shifts from confusion to one that mingles revulsion and concern. MARIA (reacting to the odor, confused) ¿Qué olor? Maribel continues to labor in discomfort; relief written all over her pained expression. Finally, Maria recognizes the foul smell, her face now showing the dawning horror of realization. She sniffs exaggeratedly, recoiling. MARIA (with growing disgust, sniffing near Maribel) ¡Ay no! ¿Tú hiciste... esto? Maribel meets her mother's gaze sheepishly. MARIBEL (a weak plea as she shuffles past) Mamá, déjame pasar de una vez. Maria steps aside, her disgust evident, waving Maribel through the entryway. MARIA (with a disgusted gesture) Pues ándale, entra, pero rápido. Maribel waddles in, cupping the seat of her pants, while Maria watches in astonishment and stops her. MARIA (warning) Espera ahí, no vayas a tirar nada. Maribel halts, her demeanour sheepish. Maria's tone is scathing as she scolds her. MARIA (tsks, scolding) ¡Qué asco, Maribel! Estás muy grande para hacer eso. Maribel, growing out of her shame, counters playfully. MARIBEL (playing off her embarrassment) Tu culpa, mamá. Tardaste muchísimo y me bloqueaste. Maria, indignant, continues to berate her. MARIA (arrogant) ¡Eso no es excusa! Te quedaste como niña y lo terminaste ahí. Maribel, playfully disgruntled, defends herself. MARIBEL (desperate justification) ¡Pero tenía que salir todo, mamá! La urgencia estaba muy fuerte. She hesitantly assesses the damage, with a complacent grimace. MARIBEL (assessing bulge with a smirk) Y la verdad... sí se sintió bien haciéndolo, a pesar de... Maria reacts in aversion. MARIA (disgusted disbelief) ¡Qué asco, parece que te gusta estar sucia! Maria's curiosity wins over, demanding a closer inspection. MARIA (scolding tone) Déjame ver eso mejor. Maribel resists, but Maria is firm, turning her around to inspect the bulge. Maria chides, expressing dismay at the mess. MARIA (shaking her head) ¡Increíble, mira qué llenos están tus pantalones! Maribel bickers, defending her actions. MARIBEL (timidly) Había mucho que necesitaba salir, mamá. Necesitaba el alivio. Maria scorns her further. MARIA (with scorn) Por lo visto havía mucho, ¿eh? No me sorprendería que hasta te guste. Maria sniff near the seat of Maribel's pants, Maribel visibly cringes. Maria reacts to the stench with exaggerated mock expressions. MARIA (reaction to the smell) ¡Huy, qué pestilencia! Estás insoportable así. Maribel admits her state. MARIBEL (crings) Claro, con esto adentro es obvio que huela fuerte. Maria teases her about the smell and urgently sends her off to clean up. MARIA (verbal pushing) ¡No puedes quedarte así! ¡Vamos al baño, pero no vayas a tirar nada! Maria escorts Maribel towards the bathroom, still reacting to the odor, ensuring no contents fall out. Complaints punctuate their journey. MARIBEL (embarrassed, voicing concern) Todo se está esparciendo con el movimiento, mamá. Maria tightens her grip, still complaining about the smell. Upon entering the bathroom threshold, Maribel teases her mother once more. MARIBEL (teasingly) ¿Quieres cambiarme el pañal ahora, mamá? Maria, fed up, playfully squashes the mess as she pushes Maribel into the bathroom. MARIA (forcefully) ¡Ya métete! ¡Qué porquería! Maribel exclaims in disgust as Maria continues to squash the bulge. MARIBEL (disgust, exaggerated cry) ¡Ay, mamá! Se aplastó todo. Maria leaves Maribel in the bathroom, still disgusted by the stench, and shuts the door behind her, muttering to herself. MARIA (plugging her nose) ¡Qué cosas hace esta niña, qué olor! FADE OUT."},{"prompt":"(Just outside the main Azur Lane base…) Enterprise: “Sheffield! You’re injured!

The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. The returning woman blurts out an ominous warning. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief while confusingly muttering to herself about things feeling warm and heavy, and then, after a brief pause to softly grunt, she continues to murmur about how much it stinks. The perplexed present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern and asks what stinks, while the returning woman continues to softly grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air with a perplexed expression. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman inquires about the odor again, describing what it smells like. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, what had actually just happened dawns upon her. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman sniffs nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks if the source of the odor is the returning woman having pooped in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so dirty like pooping in her pants is unbelievably disgusting. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and childishly finished pooping in her pants once she began. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and finish pooping in her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to poop and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where the returning woman had to make the decision to finish pooping in her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally poop, even if it ended up happening inside her pants. In response to the returning woman's comments, the present woman expresses her disgust and tauntingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty, because it seems to the present woman that the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when the returning woman speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman verbally demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's relieving deed. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect the returning woman's rear end. The present woman proceeds to chidingly ridicule the returning woman over the sight of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants. Then, the present woman continues to taunt the returning woman at length by expressing disappointed astonishment over how full the returning woman's pants are, by describing the visual appearance of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants, and by expressing disgust at the amount of poop that is in the returning woman's pants. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full not because of special intention on the returning woman's part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. The returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. * In response, the present woman exclaims with with scornful disgust that it is obvious how full the returning woman's stomach was because of this massive dump that the returning woman has taken in her pants. Then, the present woman tauntingly remarks that because it looked like the returning woman was feeling good as she was taking this massive dump, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman childishly enjoys not only relieving herself in her pants, but also having her pants be so full and loaded. The present woman adds that it is not only the full and loaded pants that the returning woman probably enjoys, but also this terrible odor that is emanating from the soiled pants too. * As she is inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants and chiding her, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she adds in coy resignation that given the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by taunting the returning woman over how pungent the odor that emanates from the returning woman's pants is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because an odor that pungent is unbearable. After that, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while verbally imploring the returning woman not to drop any of her pants’ contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom. While escorting the returning woman, the present woman is continues to react to the odor and disgustedly assists the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the odor that is emanating from the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing while reacting to her own odor. In addition, the returning woman voices her concern that the deposit is spreading inside her pants because of the motion of walking towards the bathroom. In response, the present woman reinforces her grip that is intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman’s pants. As she is reinforcing her grip, the present woman continues to complain about the the returning woman’s odor. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom’s threshold instead of entering, coyly mentioning that it feels very messy and icky inside her pants, and asking the present woman if she would like to change the her “poopy diaper”. As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grip on the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few more seconds to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while sniffing the hand that she used to squash the bulge in the returning woman's pants, physically reacting to the odor emitting from the hand, and then complaining to herself out loud about the odor from the returning woman’s soiled pants.","completion":"FADE IN: INT. LOS ANGELES APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY MARTINA CONTRERAS (16), a Mexican American sophomore, anxiously approaches the door to her family’s apartment. She is of average height with a sporty build and long, dark hair tied in a ponytail. Sporting a comfortable, vibrant hoodie layered over a plain tee and cargo shorts, her style emits casual coolness, contrasted by the slight look of distress creasing her brow. Flashbacks to the earlier parts of her day depict her avoiding the school restrooms, frantically looking at her watch during the last class, and speed walking past public bathrooms on her way home. Her deep-seated aversion to pooping anywhere but in her house is palpable, and it has led to her current predicament of barely holding it. INT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Martina's hands frantically pat her pockets, and dread floods her face - no key. She winces, starts pounding on the door. MARTINA: (calling out) Mamá, open up, please! Silence. Her distress escalates, she looks ready to burst. The voice of her mom, LUCIA CONTRERAS (40s), resonates through the door. Lucia is a woman of warmth and hospitality, her appearance is that of a matriarch who finds solace in cooking and family. LUCIA: (from inside, in Spanish) Who is it? Qué está pasando? MARTINA: It's me, Martina. Hurry, please! The door's locks click agonizingly slow. Martina shifts from foot to foot, cheeks flushed, eyes frantic. Lucia finally opens the door. She stands there, expression shifting from surprise to concern. LUCIA: What’s the rush, mi hija? MARTINA: (impatiently) Move, Ma, I need to get in! Lucia steps forward, reaching to embrace Martina out of concern, blocking her. LUCIA: (alarmed, holding Martina) ¿Qué tienes? Tell me what's wrong! MARTINA: (struggling) Let me go! I need to get past! The urgency in Martina's voice tightens as their bickering fills the hallway. MARTINA: I can’t hold it! Martina’s willpower crumbles, a soft, involuntary groan escapes her lips. Her eyes widen in a shock that quickly morphs into untimely relief, as, uncomfortably gripped by her mother, she begins to lose control. LUCIA: (puzzled) Martina, ¿qué te pasa? Martina gently disengages from Lucia’s grasp, reassuming a stance that eases her discomfort - she's allowing it to happen. MARTINA: (muttering with relief) Oh thank God... Lucia watches, befuddled, as Martina concentrates on her relief, grunting softly. LUCIA: (in a mixture of English and Spanish) Hija, are you okay? Why are you standing like that?

Don’t you dare drop any of it! MARTINA: (quietly) I’m sorry, Ma. LUCIA: (regaining composure) This is so dirty, Martina. ¡Qué asco! Martina tries to reclaim some dignity, donning a sulky retort. MARTINA: (playful defiance) Your fault for taking too long. Lucia’s patience wanes, her rebuttal sharp. LUCIA: (indignant) That’s no excuse for a grown girl! You should know better! Martina clings to her defense as she assesses her soiled condition with a chagrined complacency. MARTINA: (defensive) I had to get it out, Ma! It was your blocking that got me like this. Lucia's disgust is palpable as she mocks her daughter. LUCIA: (derisively) You enjoy this nastiness, eh? Being so dirty. They stand in the corridor, Martina still cupping her spoiled ensemble. Lucia scrutinizes her daughter's unfortunate situation with a sneer. LUCIA: (turning Martina around) Que cochina. Let’s see the mess you made. Martina bickers timidly as Lucia digs into the situation with gusto. MARTINA: (coyly) Wasn’t on purpose... Just needed relief. Lucia vents her disbelief at the obvious outcome. LUCIA: (sarcastic) Obvious how much relief you got, looking at this disaster! She leans in, sniffing dramatically for emphasis. Martina recoils. Lucia reacts with exaggerated distaste, waving her free hand for fresh air. LUCIA: (teasing) You enjoy this, right? How it's so messy, and stinky! Martina's coy admission parallels Lucia's dramatics. MARTINA: (reluctant) It stinks, yes... Can we just fix this? Lucia issues an ultimatum amid her exaggerated disgust. LUCIA: (leaning away) This stink can’t stay. Off to the bathroom, now! As Lucia navigates Martina towards the bathroom, their bickering continues amidst whiffs of discontent. Arriving at the bathroom threshold, Martina teases with false innocence. MARTINA: (teasing) Feel how messy it is? Want to change my \\"diaper,\\" Ma? Incensed by the playful insolence, Lucia counters with comical aggression. LUCIA: (playfully, squashing the mess) ¡Qué cochina! Get in there, ¡ya! Martina yelps as she shuffles forward, the squashed contents of her misconduct now adding to her discomfort. MARTINA: (squirming) Ugh, now it’s everywhere! Lucia slams the door shut behind Martina as she gags in revulsion. LUCIA: (nose pinched, exiting scene) You had that coming, insolente.

The dual of the dual of a quadratic optimization problem is generally the primal. - **True.** In mathematical optimization theory, for a wide class of problems, the dual of the dual problem is the primal problem. This is known as biduality. 2. In the standard form where inequality constraints are g(x) <= 0, all Lagrange multipliers for both inequality constraints and equality constraints should be positive. - **False.** For inequality constraints g(x) <= 0, the corresponding Lagrange multipliers must be non-negative. Conversely, Lagrange multipliers for equality constraints can be positive, negative, or zero; there is no sign restriction for them. 3. The complementary slackness conditions state that if a Lagrange multiplier associated with an inequality constraint g(x) <= 0 is null, then that constraint is strict g(x) < 0, but if it is not null then the constraint is an equality constraint g(x) = 0. - **False.** Complementary slackness actually states that if a Lagrange multiplier is non-zero, then the corresponding inequality constraint is active, meaning g(x) = 0. If the multiplier is zero, the constraint is non-active, and we cannot infer whether g(x) is strictly less than zero or equal to zero. 4. The complementary slackness conditions can be used as a stopping criterion of an optimization algorithm. - **True.** Complementary slackness is one of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and can be used to check optimality in iterative optimization algorithms. 5. The stationary points are saddle points (minimum w.r.t. the primal variable and maximum w.r.t. the dual variables and vice versa). - **True.** In the context of Lagrange multipliers, stationary points of the Lagrangian can indeed be saddle points. 6. Dual problems do not have constraints. - **False.** Dual problems often have constraints, which typically come from the primal variables' constraints or boundedness conditions. 7. In the case of equality constraints, the Lagrangian method converts a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained optimization problem. - **True.** By introducing Lagrange multipliers, equality constraints are incorporated into the objective function, removing the explicit constraints from the problem. 8. Gradient projection is the most efficient method to deal with constrained optimization. - **False.** There is no single \\"most efficient\\" method to deal with all constrained optimization problems. The efficiency of an optimization algorithm can greatly depend on the specific characteristics of the problem. 9. ADMM is a trust region method. - **False.** The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is not a trust region method; it is an algorithm that is designed to blend the decomposability of dual ascent with the superior convergence properties of the method of multipliers. 10. Interior point methods can be combined with trust regions and line search. - **True.** Interior point methods can indeed make use of trust regions and line search techniques to enhance convergence properties. 11. Barrier methods add a penalty term to the function to be optimized that becomes very big when the inequality constraints are nearly violated. - **True.** Barrier methods use a barrier function that goes to infinity as the feasible region's boundary is approached. 12. The conjugate gradient method can be combined with gradient projection. - **True.** It's possible to combine the conjugate gradient method with gradient projection for solving constrained optimization problems. 13. Quadratic programming problems include convex programming problems. - **True.** Quadratic programming is a subset of convex programming if the quadratic objective function is convex. 14. Equality-constrained quadratic problems can be solved in closed-form using Lagrange multipliers. - **True.** If a solution exists, equality-constrained quadratic problems can often be solved analytically using the method of Lagrange multipliers. 15. The Karmarkar algorithm is an interior point method simpler than affine scaling. - **True.** Karmarkar's algorithm is indeed an interior point method that was historically a groundbreaking alternative to the simplex method for linear programming. It can be considered simpler in certain respects compared to affine scaling methods. 16. The simplex algorithm is an interior point method. - **False.** The simplex algorithm is not an interior point method; it is a vertex enumeration algorithm. 17. Quadratic programming includes linear programming problems. - **True.** Linear programming is a special case of quadratic programming where the objective function is linear (and hence its second derivative, or \\"quadratic\\" term, is zero). 18. Solving a problem in closed form is always preferable and faster than using gradient descent. - **False.** While closed-form solutions can be preferable due to their exactness and often faster computation for smaller problems, they may not exist or be practical to obtain for complex or high-dimensional problems. In such cases, iterative methods like gradient descent may be more suitable. 19. Stochastic gradient descent can be used to solve constrained optimization problems. - **True.** Stochastic gradient descent can be adapted to address constrained optimization problems, often through projection methods or by incorporating the constraints into the optimization as penalty terms."},{"prompt":"can you explain soft-margin classifier ?","completion":"A soft-margin classifier is a variation of the hard-margin classifier designed to handle cases where the data is not linearly separable and contains some level of noise. It is most commonly associated with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). In a standard hard-margin SVM, the goal is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes while correctly classifying all training samples. The margin is defined as the distance between the separating hyperplane and the closest points from either class, which are called support vectors. The hard-margin SVM requires that all data points are correctly classified, which may not be possible if the data contains outliers or overlapping classes. The soft-margin SVM introduces a concept of \\"slack variables\\" to allow some misclassifications. These slack variables measure the degree to which each data point is allowed to violate the margin constraint. By introducing these variables, the classifier can tolerate points that fall on the wrong side of the margin or even the wrong side of the hyperplane, which allows the classifier to cope with overlapping class distributions and noisy data. The objective of the soft-margin SVM is to find a balance between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error. This is achieved by adding a regularization parameter (often denoted as C) to the optimization problem, which controls the trade-off between a wider margin and the penalty paid for misclassified training samples. A small value of C allows more misclassification (a softer margin), while a larger value demands fewer violations (a margin closer to the hard-margin SVM). When solving a soft-margin SVM, the optimization problem becomes: Minimize: \`(1/2) * ||w||^2 + C * Σξ_i\` Subject to: \`y_i * (w * x_i + b) ≥ 1 - ξ_i\` for all i, ξ_i ≥ 0. Here, \`w\` is the weight vector defining the hyperplane, \`b\` is the bias term, \`y_i\` are the class labels, \`x_i\` are the feature vectors, and \`ξ_i\` are the slack variables. The term \`C * Σξ_i\` is the penalty term for misclassifications. In summary, a soft-margin classifier like the soft-margin SVM is designed to create a model that sacrifices some classification accuracy on the training data, accepting a certain level of misclassification to achieve better generalization and robustness to outliers and noise in the data."},{"prompt":"There are multiple formulations of the soft-margin classifier.

This is a property derived from the formulation of the primal problem, where the penalty term for the slack variables is linearly proportional to C. 2. **False.** The Kernel matrix in the dual of an SVM problem is generally composed of the inner products of the support vectors (elements of X). The slack variables and the parameter C do not directly affect the form of the Kernel matrix. They impact the constraints on the Lagrange multipliers instead. 3. **True.** It is mathematically possible to create a composite objective function that combines different norms of the slack variables, as stated in the formulation. However, this is not a standard approach and may complicate both the interpretation and the solution of the problem. Additionally, the regularization term in the objective function does not usually mix 1-norm and 2-norm as the impacts on the solution are different. 4. **False.** A formulation based on hinge losses can be kernelized if it satisfies certain conditions. Kernelization is a method used to apply SVM to data that is not linearly separable by mapping the input space to a higher-dimensional feature space where the data can be separated by a hyperplane. The key idea is that the dot products in the higher-dimensional space can be computed using a kernel function. 5. **True.** The 1-norm regularizer can indeed replace the 2-norm regularizer and lead to a box constraint 0 ≤ alpha ≤ C in the dual problem. Using an L1-norm penalty on slack variables (which reflects the sum of absolute values) encourages sparsity in the solution and results in the creation of a box constraint for the dual variables. 6. **False.** Using the square hinge loss creates a problem that may have similarities to ridge regression in the sense that both have quadratic penalties. However, they solve different types of problems. Ridge regression penalizes based on the squared magnitude of coefficients to address multicollinearity and overfitting in regression, while the square hinge loss is used in classification tasks to provide a continuous, differentiable approximation of the hinge loss. 7. **True.** If all slack variables are 0, it implies that all data points are correctly classified and all support vectors lie on the margin. This is akin to the hard-margin SVM scenario where there is no classification error or margin violation. 8. **False.** The slack variables do appear in the dual problem, indirectly affecting the constraints on Lagrange multipliers. 9. **True.** Decreasing C can lead to a less strict penalty on slack variables and therefore allows more margin violations. As more violations are allowed, the number of support vectors (data points that lie on or within the margin) may increase."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical Thor","completion":"Customizable Art Print Design | Personalized Mug, T-Shirt & Wall Art Graphics | Unique Gift for Home and Apparel"},{"prompt":"create caption in simple eng - TEAMWORK - WORK AS A TEAM AND COME OUT OF IT TRIUMP BY WORKING AS A TEAM EMPOWERING OTHERS: RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON PERSONAL SUCCESS ” Teamwork is the heartbeat of our success journey.

[WOLFGANG looks shocked, his cute, adorable voice heightening with each word.] WOLFGANG: Its without the apostrophe, my friend! It possesses nothing! You wound me with your disregard for grammar! [This time, WOLFGANG taps HIDEKI’s shoulder with the crop. HIDEKI nearly jumps out of his chair, his eyes wide.] HIDEKI: Alright, alright, “its”! I’ll remember! [A small silence falls as HIDEKI now wide awake, races through the test with newfound energy and a touch of fear. He comes to the final question; his hand hesitates.] HIDEKI: “Who” or “whom”? I never know... [WOLFGANG leans close, his voice a mere whisper.] WOLFGANG: If you can replace it with “he” it’s “who”, if “him” then it’s “whom”... simple substitution, my dear proletarian in areas of English. HIDEKI: So, if I can say “He did it”, it’s “who”... and if it's “I did it to him,” it’s “whom”! WOLFGANG: (nodding, satisfied) At last, you see the light! Do not forget, the rules are the rules, regardless of your personal feelings about them. [HIDEKI triumphantly completes the test, slams down his pen, and slouches, exhausted.] HIDEKI: Done! Thanks for the... (yawns) unique guidance, Wolfgang. [WOLFGANG stands straight, proudly.] WOLFGANG: (smiling) Jolly good. Now, for your next challenge – the pronunciation of squirrel. HIDEKI: (smiling wearily) Okay, maybe after a five-minute nap? [WOLFGANG raises his crop, prepared.] WOLFGANG: Not on my watch, we shall beseech victory over the English tongue without delay!

Although there is some overlap, they generally focus on different stages of the innovation process and involve distinct activities: 1. Technology Scouting: Technology scouting is an active approach where individuals or teams (often referred to as technology scouts) seek out new technologies, innovations, trends, and startups that have the potential to enhance their company's product offerings or processes. It is more about identifying and acquiring specific technologies that can provide a competitive advantage or solve current challenges. This process typically includes: - Networking with researchers, innovators, and other companies to find suitable technologies. - Attending conferences, trade shows, and other events to discover the latest advancements. - Evaluating the technological and market potential of identified technologies. - Negotiating partnerships or licensing agreements to access or acquire new technologies. Technology scouting is more externally focused and action-oriented, aiming to directly integrate new technology into the organization's operations, products, or services. 2. Technology Intelligence: Technology intelligence is a broader term that refers to the systematic gathering and analysis of information about current and emerging technologies. It involves monitoring the technology landscape to understand emerging trends, potential disruptions, threats, and opportunities. Activities within technology intelligence include: - Analysis of patent landscapes and academic publications to track technology development. - Monitoring competitors’ activities and technological advancements. - Assessing the technological environment to inform strategic decision-making and R&D direction. - Using data analytics and foresight tools to anticipate future technological trends. Technology intelligence is more about strategic planning and making informed decisions based on a deep understanding of the evolution of technology within a specific market or globally. In summary, technology scouting is a targeted and tactical approach to directly acquire beneficial new technologies, while technology intelligence provides a strategic overview of the technological landscape to support decision-making and guide long-term planning. Both are critical for innovation-driven organizations that aim to maintain competitiveness in a rapidly changing technological environment."},{"prompt":"what is the difference between technology scouting and technology intelligence in one short paragraph","completion":"Technology scouting is a proactive and tactical approach aimed at identifying and acquiring specific emerging technologies and innovations that can be implemented to enhance a company's products, services, or operations. In contrast, technology intelligence is a strategic activity focused on gathering, analyzing, and utilizing information about the broader technological landscape to inform decision-making, anticipate trends, and understand potential impacts on the organization, without necessarily seeking immediate technology acquisition or implementation. While technology scouting provides actionable paths for technology integration, technology intelligence equips a company with the knowledge and insight needed for long-term technology strategy and planning."},{"prompt":"summarize this in 80 words: The Flexible Job-Shop Production (FJSP) model constitutes a well-known generalized job-shop model where operations are performed on a group of versatile machines.

Fogg that explores the ways in which technology can be designed to influence people's attitudes and behaviors. Published in 2002, the book is considered foundational in the field of persuasive technology and human-computer interaction. In the book, Fogg introduces the concept of \\"Captology\\" (an acronym for Computers As Persuasive Technologies), which is the study of how computers can be used to persuade people to change their behaviors or attitudes. He explains that persuasive technology can be found in various forms, including websites, software, and devices, and it can be used for a wide range of purposes, from encouraging healthy habits to promoting online shopping. Fogg presents a framework for understanding how persuasive technology works, which includes three core elements: the source of the persuasive message (the technology itself), the message (the content delivered), and the context (the environment in which the interaction takes place). He also identifies several key factors that influence the persuasiveness of technology, such as the credibility of the source, the attractiveness of the message, and the motivating potential of the context. The book outlines various methods and strategies for designing persuasive technologies, emphasizing the importance of understanding human psychology and social dynamics. Fogg discusses the use of principles from behavioral psychology, such as reinforcement, conditioning, and social influence, to create technologies that can effectively change behavior. Additionally, Fogg addresses ethical concerns surrounding the use of persuasive technology, highlighting the responsibility of designers and developers to create technologies that respect users' autonomy and promote positive outcomes. Overall, \\"Persuasive Technology\\" provides a comprehensive look at the intersection of technology, psychology, and influence, offering insights and guidelines for those interested in using technology to shape human behavior in a responsible and effective way."},{"prompt":"Would you give a summary about every chapter of this book?","completion":"Certainly!

Fogg's \\"Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do\\" is titled \\"Increasing Persuasion through Mobility and Connectivity.\\" In this chapter, Fogg focuses on the persuasive potential that arises from the combination of mobile technologies and constant connectivity. With the growth of mobile devices and wireless networks, technology has become an ever-present force in people's lives, providing new opportunities for persuasive interventions. **Key Points in Chapter 7:** 1. **Ubiquity of Technology**: Fogg discusses the ubiquity of technology—especially mobile devices like smartphones and tablets—and how this provides a platform for persuasive messages and interactions to occur at any time, in any location. 2. **Contextual Persuasion**: With advancements in mobile technology, devices can now deliver persuasive messages that are highly contextualized. Context-aware computing enables devices to understand where users are and what they might be doing, allowing for more targeted and relevant persuasive cues. 3. **Persuasion in the User's Context**: The chapter highlights the importance of delivering persuasive messages and interventions at the opportune moment, ideally when users are in the right context to be receptive to the desired behavior change (e.g., promoting physical activity when a person is in a gym). 4. **Interactivity and Tailoring**: Mobile devices are inherently interactive and can be used to create tailored persuasive experiences. Personalized content, based on user input or behavior, can significantly increase the effectiveness of persuasive strategies. 5. **Reach and Scalability**: Fogg points out that mobile technologies offer considerable reach and scalability, allowing creators of persuasive technology to impact large audiences across diverse geographic locations. 6. **Ethical Considerations**: The chapter also touches on the ethical implications of persuasive technologies that leverage mobility and connectivity. These technologies have the power to influence users profoundly and continuously, raising concerns about privacy, consent, and the potential for manipulation. 7. **Design Principles**: Fogg provides insights into the design principles that make mobile and connected persuasive technologies effective. He emphasizes the need for simplicity, unobtrusiveness, and respect for the user's time and attention. 8. **Real-world Examples**: Throughout the chapter, Fogg may provide examples of mobile persuasive technologies that utilize these concepts, such as health-related apps that encourage users to make healthier choices or location-based services that nudge user behavior based on their physical location. This chapter is particularly insightful in realizing how the portability and connectivity of modern devices can transform traditional approaches to persuasion, creating a framework for real-time, context-sensitive, and highly personalized methods of influencing human behavior. Fogg's analysis provides a roadmap for the design of future mobile and connected technologies that aim to persuade, with a thoughtful consideration of the ethical dimensions involved in their use."},{"prompt":"Who used the term of \\"Persuasive technology\\" for the first time?","completion":"The term \\"persuasive technology\\" was first coined by Dr. B.J.

Fogg **Overview:** In the chapter \\"Computers as Persuasive Media,\\" B.J. Fogg discusses the concept of computers not just as tools or social actors, but as environments that can simulate experiences for the purpose of persuasion. The immersive nature of media provides a powerful way to influence attitudes and behaviors by creating engaging and convincing simulations. **Key Concepts:** 1. **Simulation**: Fogg explains that computers can create simulations, which are representations of real or imagined systems. These simulations allow users to observe consequences, train skills, or explore environments without engaging in real-world equivalents, thus influencing learning and decision-making. 2. **Experiential Learning**: The chapter underscores how simulated experiences can lead to learning and behavior change. By trying different strategies and seeing the outcomes in a simulated environment, users can learn effectively and apply their insights to real-life situations. 3. **Persuasive Scenarios**: Computers as media can generate persuasive narratives or scenarios that guide users through an experience intended to change their beliefs or behavior. By leveraging storytelling, these scenarios engage users emotionally and cognitively. 4. **Relevance and Experience**: The persuasiveness of computer simulations is often determined by their relevance to the users' personal goals and the authenticity of the experiences they provide. The more a simulation resonates with and immerses a user, the more likely it is to persuade. **Applications:** 1. **Health**: The chapter provides examples, such as smoking cessation programs, where users can simulate the outcomes of healthy versus unhealthy choices, leading to greater awareness and motivation to change behavior. 2. **Education**: Fogg illustrates how educational software can engage students through interactive experiences, making learning more compelling and effective. 3. **Training**: Simulations in professional training allow individuals to practice complex tasks or procedures safely, gaining competence before applying skills in real-world scenarios. **Ethical Considerations:** Fogg also touches upon the responsibilities that come with creating persuasive simulations. The ethical design should consider the impact of such experiences on vulnerable populations and ensure that the simulations promote meaningful and positive behavior change. **Conclusion:** The chapter \\"Computers as Persuasive Media\\" highlights the significant role that simulated experiences played by computers have in shaping human behavior. Fogg demonstrates that by harnessing the power of interactivity and immersive environments, persuasive technologies can foster deeper learning and motivate individuals to alter their behavior in a lasting and impactful way. He calls for continued research and thoughtful consideration of the ethical implications as the field progresses."},{"prompt":"Привет","completion":"Привет!

Theories. As the case documents, Steve Jobs and John Sculley have rival theories: T- Steve Jobs’ theory t- John Sculley’s theory about the resources that Apple has to apply to the development of Macintosh. Both theories make predictions about the sales of Macintosh in 1984. Steve Jobs’ theory (T) allocates a probability of P(R/T)= 0,8 to the fact that the sales of Macintosh are going to be high (R) during this period. What are the probabilities that the sales are going to be low according to this theory? John Sculley’s theory (t) assigns a probability P(R/t)= 0,2 to the fact that the sales of Macintosh are going to be high (R) during this period. What are the probabilities that the sales are going to be low? If we observe r- the sales of Macintosh are low, to which theory provides more support this evidence? Let us to define d as the degree of rivalry between two theories: 1+d = P(r/t) / P(r/T) Could you compute and interpret this parameter? Knowing this parameter d and P(r/T) is sufficient for characterizing all the theories (write P(R/T), P(r/T), P(R/t) and P(r/t) in terms of the parameters above? Beliefs. Let us assume that at January of 1984, the board of directors assign a probability (p= P(t)) of 0,4 to the fact that John Sculley’s theory (t) is the correct one. Which is the probability that they assign to the fact that Steve Jobs’s theory (T) is the correct one? In which theory is the board of directors more confident? Predictions. Which is the probability P(R) that the board of directors allocates to the fact that the sales of Macintosh are going to be high (and low P(r)) during 1984? Could you derive a formula relating P(r) with parameters p, d and probability P(r/T)? Evidence. During 1984, the sales of Macintosh were low (r). Learning: Changes in knowledge. The board of directors updates their beliefs using Bayesian inference. Which is the probability that they assign now to the fact that Steve Jobs’ theory is the correct one? And to John Sculley’s one? How do you relate these figures to the case? Quantifying learning. Let us define: 1+L = P(t/r) / p. Could you relate the parameter L with learning? Try to derive a formula relating (1+L) with parameters p and d. Which values of p and d implies that L is going to be positive? What it does mean? Common knowledge. According to the behavior of Steve Jobs in 1985, could be assumed that for him the probability that the theory T is true is 1? Under the assumption above compute his updated beliefs P(T/r) assuming that Steve Jobs acts rationally (uses Bayesian inference) and knows the same theories and see the same evidence than the board of directors. Steve Jobs’ updated beliefs are the same than those of the board of directors? In this case, he has learnt or will learn something? The truth.

P(R/t) = 0.2 (probability of high sales given John Sculley's theory) 2. P(r/t) = 1 - P(R/t) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 (probability of low sales). **Degree of Rivalry (d):** [ 1+d = frac{P(r/t)}{P(r/T)} ] [ 1+d = frac{0.8}{0.2} ] [ 1+d = 4 ] [ d = 4 - 1 ] [ d = 3 ] This degree of rivalry shows how much more likely John Sculley's theory predicts low sales compared to Steve Jobs' theory. If ( d > 0 ), Sculley's theory (t) predicts the outcome r more than Jobs' theory (T). Using the degree of rivalry, we can now express the four probabilities: - P(R/T) = 0.8 (given) - P(r/T) = 0.2 (calculated above) - P(R/t) = 0.2 (given) - P(r/t) = P(r/T) * (1 + d) = 0.2 * 4 = 0.8 (calculated above) **Board of Directors' Initial Beliefs:** 1. P(t) = 0.4 (John Sculley’s theory) 2. P(T) = 1 - P(t) = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 (Steve Jobs' theory) The board was initially more confident in Steve Jobs' theory because P(T) > P(t). **Predictions by the Board of Directors:** To calculate P(R) and P(r), we need to use the law of total probability: P(R) = P(R/T)P(T) + P(R/t)P(t) P(R) = 0.8 * 0.6 + 0.2 * 0.4 P(R) = 0.48 + 0.08 P(R) = 0.56 P(r) = 1 - P(R) P(r) = 1 - 0.56 P(r) = 0.44 **Evidence and Bayesian Update:** After observing that sales were low, the board updates their beliefs. Using Bayes' theorem: P(T/r) = (P(r/T)P(T)) / P(r) P(T/r) = (0.2 * 0.6) / 0.44 P(T/r) = 0.12 / 0.44 P(T/r) ≈ 0.2727 P(t/r) = (P(r/t)P(t)) / P(r) P(t/r) = (0.8 * 0.4) / 0.44 P(t/r) = 0.32 / 0.44 P(t/r) ≈ 0.7273 And the parameter L, which demonstrates learning: 1+L = P(t/r) / p L = P(t/r) / p - 1 L = 0.7273 / 0.4 - 1 L = 1.81825 - 1 L ≈ 0.81825 This L > 0 implies that learning has occurred; the directors have significantly updated their beliefs about Sculley’s theory being more likely after observing the evidence. **Common Knowledge & Steve Jobs' Beliefs:** If Jobs believed with complete certainty that his theory was true (P(T) = 1), then even after observing the low sales, he would not update his beliefs: P(T/r) = 1 because he's already certain that his theory is correct. In reality, Jobs might still update his beliefs based on evidence, if he were acting rationally and using Bayesian inference. **The Decision of the Board of Directors:** Without historical context, it's difficult to evaluate whether the board of directors' decision was correct. However, if Sculley’s theory was indeed correct, and the board adjusted their beliefs after the evidence of low sales, they acted rationally by updating in favor of the more predictive theory. Ultimately, the correct decision would be based on the actual outcomes and not necessarily on the probabilities assigned at the time, as those were based on the information available then. Rationality is about the process, not necessarily the outcome."},{"prompt":"Case: Power Struggles in Apple The relationship between John Sculley and Steve Jobs has been well documented in books, films and in the press.

Maximum recommended extension: 1 page","completion":"Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976, along with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. Over the next few years, the company experienced significant growth thanks to the success of products like the Apple II and the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. John Sculley, a successful business leader known for his marketing expertise at PepsiCo, was recruited by Jobs and became CEO of Apple in 1983. Jobs and Sculley initially had a close relationship, exemplified by the famous pitch from Jobs to Sculley: \\"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life, or do you want to come with me and change the world?\\" However, as Apple grew, Jobs and Sculley began to clash over management styles and the direction of the company. Jobs, a visionary, was known for his demanding leadership style and focus on product innovation and design aesthetics. Sculley, however, had a background in sales and marketing and pushed for a more structured and disciplined approach to business, focusing on profitability and market share. The tension came to a head in 1985. Apple was facing increasing competition, internal strife, and a struggle to gain significant market share in the personal computer industry, especially against IBM. The Macintosh, while innovative, did not meet the high sales expectations initially set for it, leading to disagreements on strategy. Jobs attempted to orchestrate a boardroom coup to oust Sculley, but it backfired, and Jobs ended up being stripped of his duties. He subsequently resigned from Apple and went on to found NeXT, another computer company, and later Pixar, an animation studio. Steve Jobs returned to a floundering Apple as an advisor following Apple's acquisition of NeXT in 1996 and was appointed interim CEO in 1997. At this time, Apple was in dire financial straits, having suffered several years of declining sales, mounting losses, and a lack of clear direction. Jobs revitalized Apple's product line, streamlined operations, and spearheaded the launch of groundbreaking products like the iMac, iPod, and later the iPhone, which not only saved Apple from the brink of bankruptcy but also set it on the path to becoming one of the most valuable companies in the world. Jobs' second stint as CEO was marked by the establishment of a business model heavily reliant on innovation, design, and a tightly integrated ecosystem of hardware, software, and services. This approach dramatically contrasted with the prevailing industry model of separate companies specializing in hardware or software, exemplified by the relationship between Microsoft and various PC manufacturers. The power struggles between Jobs and Sculley highlight the critical role of leadership and vision in the technology sector. Jobs' focus on product-led growth, user experience, and design aesthetics ultimately proved to be the right strategy for Apple. It underscores the importance of aligning a company's business model with its core competencies and market demands—a lesson that remains relevant for tech companies today."},{"prompt":"what are the questions can i ask to who are going to present this apple case","completion":"When preparing questions for presenters of a case study about Apple, especially focusing on the power struggles between Steve Jobs and John Sculley and their differing views on business models, you may consider asking questions that promote critical thinking and deeper analysis of the case.

Question 1a: To calculate the expected returns for Assets A and B (ER_A and ER_B), you'd do the following for each asset: ER = Summation (P(i) * R(i)), where P is the probability and R is the return for the i-th state. For Asset A: ER_A = (0.3 * 0.12) + (0.4 * 0.02) + (0.3 * -0.02) For Asset B: ER_B = (0.3 * 0.08) + (0.4 * 0.01) + (0.3 * -0.08) The standard deviation for each asset (SD_A and SD_B) is calculated as follows: SD = sqrt(Summation(P(i) * (R(i) - ER)^2)), where ER is the expected return calculated above. To calculate the covariance between Assets A and B (Cov_AB): Cov_AB = Summation(P(i) * (R_A(i) - ER_A) * (R_B(i) - ER_B)) The minimum variance portfolio allocation can be found by using the formula: w_A = (SD_B^2 - Cov_AB) / (SD_A^2 + SD_B^2 - 2 * Cov_AB) w_B = 1 - w_A Then, the expected return of the minimum variance portfolio (ER_MVP) is: ER_MVP = w_A * ER_A + w_B * ER_B Question 1b: For portfolio weights of 0.8 for Asset A and 0.2 for Asset B: ER_P = (0.8 * ER_A) + (0.2 * ER_B) Its standard deviation (SD_P) is calculated using the formula: SD_P = sqrt((0.8^2 * SD_A^2) + (0.2^2 * SD_B^2) + (2 * 0.8 * 0.2 * Cov_AB)) Question 1c: To calculate the correlation coefficient (ρ) between the portfolio (0.8, 0.2) and each asset: ρ(P,A) = Cov(P,A) / (SD_P * SD_A) ρ(P,B) = Cov(P,B) / (SD_P * SD_B) Where Cov(P,A) and Cov(P,B) are the covariances of the portfolio with Asset A and Asset B respectively, calculated as: Cov(P,A) = 0.8 * SD_A^2 + 0.2 * Cov_AB Cov(P,B) = 0.8 * Cov_AB + 0.2 * SD_B^2 Please take these equations and calculations to create an Excel spreadsheet for computations, and use a text processor like Microsoft Word or LaTeX to explain the procedures and comment on the results.

However, I will give you the methods and steps rather than the actual calculations since I cannot create files or graphics. Question 2a: Minimum-Variance Portfolio Weights, Standard Deviation, and Expected Return The formula for obtaining the weights of the minimum-variance portfolio (MVP) considering three assets with a given variance-covariance matrix is more complex than with two assets. It generally involves matrix calculations. You solve for the weights using the following formula: w_MVP = (inverse(MV_C) * 1) / (1^T * inverse(MV_C) * 1) where 1 is a column vector of ones, inverse() is the matrix inverse, and T denotes the matrix transpose. The standard deviation of the MVP (SD_MVP) is computed as follows: SD_MVP = sqrt(w_MVP^T * MV_C * w_MVP) The expected return of the MVP (ER_MVP) is then given by: ER_MVP = E(R)^T * w_MVP Question 2b: Tangency Portfolio Weights, Standard Deviation, and Expected Return The weights of the tangency portfolio (TP) considering a risk-free rate (RF) can be found using: w_TP = (inverse(MV_C) * (E(R) - RF * 1)) / (1^T * inverse(MV_C) * (E(R) - RF * 1)) The expected return of the TP (ER_TP) can be computed as: ER_TP = E(R)^T * w_TP The standard deviation of the TP (SD_TP) is: SD_TP = sqrt(w_TP^T * MV_C * w_TP) Question 2c: Minimum Variance Portfolio with Expected Return of 0.08 The weights of a minimum variance portfolio with a specific expected return can be obtained by combining the weights of the MVP and the TP based on the desired expected return. w_req = (ER_TP - 0.08) / (ER_TP - ER_MVP) * w_MVP + (0.08 - ER_MVP) / (ER_TP - ER_MVP) * w_TP Question 2d: Minimum Variance Frontier and Plot The minimum variance frontier (MVF) is a graph of the expected return against the standard deviation of various portfolios. To plot the MVF, you typically vary the expected return and solve for the corresponding portfolio weights using a combination of the MVP and TP, as shown in 2c. Once you have an array of expected returns and their corresponding standard deviations, you can plot them to visualize the MVF. To situate assets A, B, C, and the portfolios from a), b), and c), you would simply add points on the plot at the corresponding standard deviations and expected returns for each. To execute the matrix operations required for these calculations, you can use Excel or other software capable of matrix computations. You'll need to enter the variance-covariance matrix and the vector of expected returns as inputs. Once the calculations are complete, you can represent the portfolio frontiers graphically, using a scatter plot, for instance, in Excel. Remember that the Two-Fund Separation Theorem states that any investor's portfolio choice can be divided into two decisions: the allocation between a risk-free asset and a market portfolio (TP in this case), and the risky asset proportions in the market portfolio. Please note that these steps will give you the framework needed to complete the assignment, given that the actual calculations and plotting require the use of actual software like Excel or programming languages with matrix computation capabilities like MATLAB or Python. After performing these calculations, you should create a document explaining the procedures and comments on the results, as well as the Excel spreadsheet with the calculations, and then compress them into a .rar or .zip file for submission."},{"prompt":"Write an comedy anime scene about a young man watching his roommate take a English test.

SMALL STUDY ROOM - DAY The sun streams lazily through a halfway-open window while TAKESHI (18), in his crisp khaki military uniform complete with leather gloves, polished boots, and breeches stands sternly behind his roommate, KENJI, who is slumped over an English test at the desk. Takeshi’s short black hair is impeccably styled, his spectacles glinting in the sunlight, and his posture is so rigid one might mistake him for a statue were it not for the occasional twitch of impatience. Kenji yawns mightily, his head dipping alarmingly close to the test paper, his pen creating a trail of ink as his strength fades. TAKESHI (clearly amused) Are we redecorating your test with abstract art, or are you aiming for a passing grade, Kenji-san? Kenji jerks up, a bit startled, rubbing his eyes. Takeshi holds the riding crop at the ready, a playful but strict glint in his eye. KENJI (groggy) Give me a break, Takeshi. English is the enemy, not sleep. Takeshi taps the riding crop lightly against the desk, clicking his tongue. TAKESHI (with an adorable voice) ‘Enemy' is too strong a word, Kenji-san. Perhaps 'formidable opponent' suits better, as I will be if you mistake 'their' for 'there' one more time. Kenji grimaces at his test, aware that Takeshi's grammar perfectionism is both a blessing and a curse. KENJI Those words are practically twins! How do you tell them apart? TAKESHI (an enthusiastic instructor) ‘Their’ has the word ‘heir’ in it, meaning possession. ‘There’ has ‘here’ inside it, meaning location! Simple, Kenji-san, simple! KENJI (mocking) Oh, great sensei of syntax, forgive my ignorance! Takeshi gives a triumphant nod, clearly enjoying the role. Suddenly, Kenji’s head dips again, edging towards the test. Takeshi swiftly and gently taps the riding crop on the desk, a slight smile betraying his strict demeanor. TAKESHI (cheerfully strict) No sleeping soldiers on the study battlefield, Private Kenji! Kenji jumps for the umpteenth time, scrambling to maintain the facade of wakefulness. He squints at Takeshi with mock annoyance. KENJI When did my English test become military boot camp? TAKESHI (proudly) When you enlisted the aid of Sergeant Takeshi, grammar division. Persevere, solider! This is the trench of prepositions and articles, and we shall not be defeated. Kenji chuckles, despite himself. Maybe, just maybe, with Takeshi's special brand of comedic discipline, English wouldn't be the enemy — not today.

Вот несколько примеров того, как это можно сделать: 1. **\\"Спасибо, но я предпочту воздержаться.\\"** Используйте, когда хотите отказать в чем-то тонко. 2. **\\"Очень интересное предложение, но, к сожалению, в данный момент я должен это пропустить.\\"** Когда не хотите принимать чье-то предложение. 3. **\\"Я ценю вашу инициативу, но думаю, будет лучше, если мы найдем другое решение.\\"** Если вы не согласны с предложением. 4. **\\"Позвольте мне остаться при своем мнении.\\"** Когда вы намерены не менять свою позицию. 5. **\\"Ваше мнение интересно, однако у меня совершенно другая точка зрения.\\"** Если вы не согласны с чьим-то мнением. 6. **\\"Я уверен(а), что найдется кто-то, кто с радостью сможет вам помочь. Я, к сожалению, не подхожу на эту роль.\\"** Когда вам предлагают что-то, что вам не по душе. 7. **\\"Боюсь, мои планы на этот день уже полностью заполнены.\\"** Если вам не хочется куда-то идти или что-то делать. Важно помнить, что тон, выражение лица и контекст, в котором вы используете эти фразы, сыграют важную роль в том, как ваше сообщение будет воспринято.

Давайте подумаем о чём-то другом.\\"** Отрицание чьего-то предложения с предложением альтернативы. 3. **\\"На этот раз я пас.

Your task is to build an ADT for a simple social media platform. Below I'll outline the main points and steps necessary to accomplish this assignment. However, due to the complexity and length of the code involved, I will not be able to provide a full implementation in this response. # Step by Step Approach to the Assignment 1. **Understanding the Requirements:** - Review and understand the task requirements thoroughly. - Identify the data structures needed for posts, comments, replies, and the platform. - Note that the functionality for replies is a bonus task. 2. **Setting Up the File Structure:** - Create the header files (\`post.h\`, \`comment.h\`, \`reply.h\`, \`platform.h\`) and implementation files (\`post.c\`, \`comment.c\`, \`reply.c\`, \`platform.c\`) as instructed. - Add a \`main.c\` file for the command line interface to interact with the user. - Possibly create additional helper files if needed. 3. **Defining Data Types:** - Design the structures for \`Post\`, \`Comment\`, \`Reply\`, and \`Platform\` as defined in the prompt. - Ensure each structure contains the necessary fields. - Decide on appropriate data structures (e.g., linked lists) to manage collections like lists of posts, comments, and replies. 4. **Implementing Functions:** - Write functions for creating, manipulating, and deleting posts, comments, and replies as required. - Pay attention to the detailed specifications for each function including parameters, return values, and descriptions. 5. **Building the Platform ADT:** - Focus on the key operations of the platform such as adding/deleting posts and comments, viewing posts/comments, and navigating between posts. - Implement the global \`Platform\` instance as a single starting point for all operations. 6. **Writing the Driver Code (\`main.c\`):** - Develop a text-based interface for users to interact with your ADT through command line inputs. - Handle user input and call the appropriate functions based on the commands received. - Provide error messages and feedback based on the outcomes of operations. 7. **Testing and Validation:** - Create test cases to confirm that all functionality works correctly. - Make sure that the functions behave according to the specifications when given correct and incorrect input. 8. **Code Quality and Documentation:** - Write clean, readable, and well-documented code following good programming practices. - Comment your code to explain non-obvious logic. 9. **Preparing for Submission:** - Construct a Makefile that compiles the code. - Write a README.md file including any assumptions you've made during the implementation. - Ensure that all required files are included in your \`.zip\` file, which is named according to your roll number. 10. **Evaluation Preparation:** - Be ready for a Viva or manual code walk-through where you'll need to explain your implementation. - Understand every part of your code to be able to answer questions about it. # Things to Keep in Mind - Make sure to adhere to the deadline and the plagiarism policy. - The quality of your code and your ability to explain it during evaluations are critical. - Bonus sections can help compensate for lost marks but won't give you extra credit. Given the complexity and educational nature of this task, the goal here is for you to work through the problem to learn how to implement an ADT and interact with it through a user interface. Try breaking down the problem into smaller parts and tackle each part one by one. Good luck with your assignment!"},{"prompt":"Give me code snippet for the viewpost function and how it’s called","completion":"Sure, I can provide you with a simple example of the \`viewPost\` function and how it might be called within a C program. Please note that this is a snippet and won't work by itself; you’ll need to integrate it into your ADT structure and main application code. Firstly, let's define the \`Post\` data structure in a file named \`post.h\`: \`\`\`c // post.h #ifndef POST_H #define POST_H typedef struct CommentStruct { // Definition for the CommentStruct here } Comment; typedef struct PostStruct { char *username; char *caption; Comment *comments; // Assume this is some form of list, like a linked list struct PostStruct *next; // Pointer to the next post for creating a linked list } Post; #endif // POST_H \`\`\` Next, within a file named \`platform.h\`, we can declare the \`Platform\` structure and the function prototype for \`viewPost\`: \`\`\`c // platform.h #ifndef PLATFORM_H #define PLATFORM_H #include \\"post.h\\" typedef struct { Post *posts; // Head of the list of posts Post *lastViewedPost; // The last viewed post } Platform; // Function prototype Post* viewPost(Platform *platform, int n); #endif // PLATFORM_H \`\`\` Now in a file named \`platform.c\`, we implement the \`viewPost\` function: \`\`\`c // platform.c #include \\"platform.h\\" #include <stdio.h> // Function that returns the nth recent post from the list Post* viewPost(Platform *platform, int n) { if (platform == NULL || n < 1) { printf(\\"Invalid parameters for viewing post.n\\"); return NULL; } Post *current = platform->posts; int count = 1; // Traverse the list to find the nth post while (current != NULL && count < n) { current = current->next; count++; } if (current == NULL) { printf(\\"Post number %d does not exist.n\\", n); return NULL; } // Update last viewed post platform->lastViewedPost = current; return current; } \`\`\` Finally, in the \`main.c\` file, you would call \`viewPost\` like this: \`\`\`c // main.c #include \\"platform.h\\" #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> // Assume we have some logic here to create a platform and add posts to it void displayPost(Post *post) { if (post != NULL) { printf(\\"Username: %sn\\", post->username); printf(\\"Caption: %sn\\", post->caption); // If required, display comments here } } int main() { Platform *platform = ... // Code to initialize platform // Let's say we want to view the 2nd most recent post int postNumber = 2; Post *postToView = viewPost(platform, postNumber); if (postToView != NULL) { displayPost(postToView); } // Clean-up code as needed for platform and posts return 0; } \`\`\` Notice that in an actual application, you would need additional code to initialize the \`Platform\` struct, dynamically allocate the \`Post\` structures, manage memory, and possibly add error checking and handling. Remember to adapt this code to the particulars of your assignment, including the correct handling of the linked list of comments, error messages, and any additional functionality you've defined."},{"prompt":"What are all the open source authoritative DNS servers that is supported for Windows?","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, there are limited options for open-source authoritative DNS server software that is natively supported on Windows. While it is more common to run open-source DNS software on Unix-like systems such as Linux or FreeBSD, there are some options that have Windows support: 1. **BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Daemon)**: - BIND is one of the most widely used DNS server software and is considered the de facto standard. - It is capable of acting as an authoritative server for DNS and supports Windows, although it is more commonly used on Unix-like systems. - Windows support has fluctuated over time with various versions of BIND; hence, it is essential to check for the latest supported versions. 2. **PowerDNS**: - PowerDNS offers a powerful and flexible DNS server that can be used as an authoritative server, and it has a version called PowerDNS for Windows. - Although PowerDNS is primarily developed for Unix-like systems, there's a community effort to maintain Windows compatibility, even though it might not be officially supported or could be outdated. 3. **MaraDNS**: - MaraDNS is a lightweight and simple DNS server that includes authoritative and recursive DNS server functions. - It has been historically supported on Windows and may be a suitable choice for smaller or simpler setups. 4. **Posadis**: - Posadis is another DNS server capable of running on Windows. - Though it has not been as actively developed as others, it may still be available for use on Windows. When running open-source DNS software on Windows, it's important to consider that the software might not be as thoroughly tested or supported as it is on Unix-like systems. Additionally, newer versions might not always be available for Windows, or Windows-specific documentation may be limited. Another approach that is commonly used is to run the software on a Linux distribution inside a virtual machine (VM) or a container on Windows. With the advent of WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), it's also possible to run Unix-like environments directly within Windows, which could enable easier use of Linux-targeted DNS software. Always check the official documentation or software repositories for the most up-to-date and accurate information regarding platform compatibility and support."},{"prompt":"i have this script to take the polygon but instead its take the bounding box \\" for i in range(len(instances)): # Extract polygon vertices from the instance polygon = instances.pred_masks[i].cpu().numpy().astype(np.uint8) contours, _ = cv2.findContours(polygon, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE) # Get the bounding box of the polygon x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contours[0]) area = w * h # See the area of the bounding box if area < 6000 or area > 600000: continue # Crop the region using the bounding box cropped_region = image_array[y:y+h, x:x+w]","completion":"It seems that you want to extract the actual polygons from the predicted masks and use those instead of the bounding boxes for cropping regions from an image. The script you've provided currently calculates the bounding rectangle for a contour without actually using the polygon shape itself for cropping. To crop the image using the polygon shape instead of its bounding box, you need to create a mask from the polygon and use it to mask out the region from the image. Below is the modified version of your script that should perform cropping using the actual polygon instead of just the bounding box: \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np # Assuming \`instances\` and \`image_array\` are already defined and available for i in range(len(instances)): # Extract polygon vertices from the instance polygon = instances.pred_masks[i].cpu().numpy().astype(np.uint8) contours, _ = cv2.findContours(polygon, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE) if not contours: continue # Create an empty mask and draw the contours (filling the polygon) mask = np.zeros_like(image_array, dtype=np.uint8) cv2.drawContours(mask, contours, -1, (255, 255, 255), -1) # -1 to draw all contours # Create a boolean mask where the polygon is boolean_mask = mask.astype(bool) # Crop the region using the polygon mask cropped_region = image_array[boolean_mask].reshape(mask.shape) # Optional: You might want to store/save the cropped regions here # cv2.imwrite('cropped_region_{}.png'.format(i), cropped_region) # The \`cropped_region\` is now an image array that contains only the masked region \`\`\` Please note that in the above code \`cropped_region\` will have the same dimensions as the full image, but only the pixels inside the masked polygon will be retained; the rest will be set to 0. If you want the cropped result to be tight around the region, you need to calculate the bounding box of the non-zero part of \`cropped_region\` and crop it further. This is because \`boolean_mask\` is a full-size mask, and even though we've masked it with our polygon, the resulting array maintains the original image's dimensions."},{"prompt":"translate אנסמבל גליל במופע חדש ״Sound of the Galilee\\", כשמוזיקה אתנית פוגשת מוזיקה קלאסית, מסע בין צלילי המוזיקה היהודית, הערבית, הארמנית, הטורקית והרומנית. בווירטואוזיות ובעדינות פורטים על הרפרטואר האינסופי של המוזיקה שבין המערב למזרח, מארג מלאכת מחשבת של מוזיקה חדשה וישנה, מקטן לגדול שסוחף למסע מרגש שנע בין הלב והנשמה. את האנסמבל שמורכב כולו מנגנים פנומנליים מנהלת ומובילה הצ'לנית והמעבדת הבינלאומית ליאת סבא - ליאת, הגיעה מניו-יורק אל הגליל במטרה ליצור קבוצה בינלאומית בהשראת הדו-קיום שבין העמים בדומה לניו-יורק.","completion":"The Galilee Ensemble in a new performance, \\"Sound of the Galilee,\\" where ethnic music meets classical, journeying through the sounds of Jewish, Arab, Armenian, Turkish, and Romanian music.

My interview was at 7 AM, and I planned to wake up at 4:40 AM since it was going to rain, according to the weather forecast. I was worried about not waking up on time because I went to bed around midnight and I struggled to fall asleep due to that worry. So, when I mentioned to my friend that I only got about 3 hours of sleep, he asked if it was because I was nervous about the interview. I clarified that I wasn’t nervous about the interview itself but worried about not making it on time. Then, my friend insisted that it was still interview-related anxiety, and I countered that the two were different issues. Which of the two is right?","completion":"Both you and your friend have points that could be considered valid, but it primarily depends on how you perceive and define the context of the anxiety. Your perspective is that your lack of sleep was not due to anxiety about the actual interview process (e.g., meeting the interviewer, answering questions, etc.), but rather about external factors such as waking up on time and facing weather-related obstacles on the way to the interview. You seem to differentiate between anxiety about the content and outcome of the interview and logistical concerns related to punctuality. On the other hand, your friend's point is based on a broader interpretation, where anything that affects your preparation for the interview or could potentially impact the interview process falls under the umbrella of \\"interview-related anxiety.\\" Since your concerns about timeliness and getting to the interview location are directly connected to the interview itself, your friend considers these worries as part of the same category. In psychological terms, what you experienced could be considered \\"situation-specific anxiety\\" because it was tied to particular circumstances (the walk in the rain and waking up on time) rather than a general feeling of anxiety about the interview situation as a whole. Fundamentally, this is a matter of semantics, and both of you are right in your own ways. It comes down to whether you categorize the worry as part of the broader interview concerns or as a separate issue related to logistics. Regardless, it's clear that your concerns had a real impact on your sleep and overall preparation for the interview."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

You are referring to the worry about being late for the interview due to the walking distance, while your friend is associating your anxiety with the interview process itself. Both can be linked to the interview event but address different concerns. Your explanation in English would be: \\"I had an interview this morning which is a 6-minute drive away, but I had to walk, requiring about an hour. My interview was at 7 AM, and I planned to wake up at 4:40 AM since it was going to rain, according to the weather forecast. I was worried about not waking up on time because I went to bed around midnight and I struggled to fall asleep due to that worry. So, when I mentioned to my friend that I only got about 3 hours of sleep, they asked if it was because I was nervous about the interview. I clarified that I wasn't nervous about the interview itself but worried about not making it on time. Then, my friend insisted that it was still interview-related anxiety, and I countered that the two were different issues.\\" In this description, you're distinguishing between performance anxiety (worry about how you'll do in the interview) and punctuality anxiety (worry about getting there on time). It’s a subtle but important difference, highlighting that anxiety can have multiple facets related to a single event."},{"prompt":"Even if I go on a picnic the next day, there are times when I can't sleep well the day before. Is this because I get nervous about picnics?","completion":"Not necessarily. If you can't sleep well the night before a picnic, it might be due to various reasons, and nervousness about the picnic could be one of them. However, it could also be related to other factors such as: 1. Excitement: You might be feeling excited about the upcoming picnic and the activities you'll be doing. 2. Anticipation: The positive anticipation of the pleasant experience can keep your mind active, making it hard to sleep. 3. Change in routine: The preparation for or the thought of doing something out of your regular schedule can disrupt your sleep pattern. 4. Overthinking: You might be planning the day in your head, thinking about what to pack, the logistics of the day, or the social interactions that will occur, which can keep you awake. 5. Stress: Any event, even a positive one like a picnic, can induce stress about making everything perfect or meeting expectations. It's important to identify what specifically is causing the sleep disturbance. Is it anxious thoughts directly related to the picnic? Or simply the general excitement and disruption of routine? Each person's experience is unique, and the reasons for poor sleep before a special event can vary widely."},{"prompt":"So maybe I'm right?","completion":"Yes, you could be right. If you're having trouble sleeping before a picnic or an interview, it doesn't necessarily mean you're nervous about the event itself. It could be due to anticipation, excitement, or simply a change in your routine, as mentioned. It's important to understand the nuances of your own feelings and the specific reasons behind your sleeplessness, which might not be solely attributed to nervousness about the event's outcome or activities. Identifying the exact cause can help in finding strategies to manage sleep better in similar future situations."},{"prompt":"But why does he confirm my feelings like he knows it all?","completion":"It sounds like your friend might have made an assumption about the cause of your feelings based on a common response many people have to upcoming events, such as an interview. Often, people tend to generalize and think that if someone is anxious or unable to sleep the night before a significant event, it must be due to nerves about the event itself. Your friend probably didn't mean to dismiss your feelings but likely offered a typical explanation without realizing there could be other contributing factors. It's a human tendency to interpret others' experiences through a lens of personal understanding or societal norms. If you feel misunderstood, it might be helpful to have a conversation with your friend to express that while you appreciate their perspective, there are other reasons behind your feelings. Clear communication can help them see your point of view and avoid similar misunderstandings in the future. It's also a good opportunity to reinforce the idea that even well-meaning friends can't know exactly what's going on inside someone else's head unless they share it."},{"prompt":"And actually this was more of an induction, not an interview. He also knows I don't have to worry, because he got involved in this first and told me it was an induction, not an interview.","completion":"Given this additional context, it appears that your friend might have tried to ease your concerns by emphasizing the less formal nature of an induction compared to an interview. Inductions generally involve less pressure as they are typically about welcoming new people and providing them with necessary information, rather than evaluating their suitability for a role. Your friend, having been through a similar process and possibly understanding that inductions are usually straightforward and non-evaluative, might have assumed that any sleeplessness or anxiety was unnecessary or misplaced. While their intention was likely to provide reassurance, it seems they overlooked the fact that your worry was not about the induction itself but about the logistics of arriving on time. In such situations, it can be helpful to clarify the specific nature of your concerns. You can acknowledge that while you understand the induction isn't something to worry about, thanks to your friend's insights, other aspects, like punctuality or preparation for the day, are causing you unrest. By being precise about the cause of your feelings, you can better address them and help your friend understand where you're coming from."},{"prompt":"Write a story that is a catfight narrative that depicts an intense physical altercation between two women, Alizia (Brazilian) and Jannet (Roumanian), two fit, muscular, voluptuous, attractive and gorgeous blonde bombshells, who are arch-rivals, colleagues office as secretary and receptionist respectively, as well as in love with the company's manager. Describe the company where they work in, located in Florida where both women lived in, and stage of the beggining scene is in their workplace (Describe details of the stage) as both women work. Create a scene where both women have an encounter, their rivalry getting the best of them and taking pokes at each other, although privately and without anyone noticing, prefering to keep their rivalry between them. Include dialogues.","completion":"In the sultry heart of Florida, amidst the towering skyscrapers boasting mirrored glass and steel, sat the prestigious company, Aeon Technologies. Its glossy facade reflected the brilliant blue sky, embodying the dreams of its employees. The interior boasted a contemporary aesthetic, with an open floor plan complemented by sleek, white furniture and splashes of verdant green from meticulously placed potted plants. Within the walls of this corporate giant worked two exceptional women, Alizia and Jannet. Alizia, the Brazilian secretary, possessed the grace of a dancer and the assertive presence of a seasoned professional. Her hair, as golden as the sandy beaches of her hometown, cascaded down her muscular back. Jannet, the beguiling Romanian receptionist, was her counterpart in many ways—a vision of Eastern European beauty with the same arresting blonde locks and an enviable physique honed by hours of dedication to fitness. Their office, set at opposite ends of the executive floor, buzzed with the energy of a beehive. Glass partitions revealed their battleground: desks facing each other, each a mirror of ambition and unspoken enmity. The only thing louder than the click-clacking of keyboards was the silent clash of their competing desires for the company manager, a man oblivious to the raging storm beneath the surface of his foremost employees' professional demeanor. On this particularly sweltering day, the air was thick with tension and the Floridian humidity. As Alizia strode past Jannet's reception area, her hips swaying provocatively, she offered a saccharine smile. \\"Good morning, Jannet. Another day in paradise, isn't it?\\" Alizia's voice dripped with double meanings, offering the courtesy of a colleague while subtly underlining her position of authority within the office hierarchy. Jannet returned the smile with a sparkle in her ice-blue eyes that could chill champagne. \\"Alizia, darling, you look... vibrant today. Did you do something new with your hair, or is it just the lust for triumph I see shimmering?\\" She tucked a strand behind her ear, a gesture calculated to showcase her toned arms—a challenge to her adversary showcasing both beauty and strength. The other employees, engrossed in their work, failed to notice the undercurrents flowing between the two women. To them, Alizia and Jannet were the picture of professional colleagues, but beneath the veneer of office decorum waged a war of attrition, fought with barbed words and knowing glances. \\"Achievement always looks good on me,\\" Alizia retorted, leaning casually against a column, her biceps flexing. Her manicured fingers tapped a rhythm against her arm, a coded Morse signaling her readiness for the fight ahead. Jannet leaned forward, the fabric of her blouse stretching across her chest provocatively, the curve of her ample assets almost touching the reception desk's surface. \\"And yet, the sweetest prize remains out of your reach, não é mesmo?\\" she teased, her accent adding an exotic caress to her words. Their eyes locked, twin tempests of azure and emerald. The air crackled with electricity, each woman acutely aware that the line between control and chaos was as fine as the eyeliner they had skillfully applied that morning. Neither would budge, neither would bend—their shared desire for the manager's affection driving them ever closer to a precipice from which there could be no returning. Just then, the elevator chimed, and the office doors swished open, admitting the object of their rivalry, the manager. Both women's postures softened, their smiles shifted into more genuine expressions, and they returned to their respective battle stations. Alizia glided to her desk, her mind already plotting the next encounter, while Jannet greeted the manager with her most charming smile, her heart beating a drum solo of anticipation and determination. \\"Playtime's over... for now,\\" Alizia whispered under her breath as she sat, knowing full well that when the lights dimmed and the office emptied, the true contest would begin anew. Jannet, catching the whisper, simply winked in response, their mutual understanding crystal clear: they were combatants in a game where beauty was their armor, and seduction was their sword."},{"prompt":"Always have both warm and cool clothing with you, regardless of where you are rostered to work each day.

Since the message contains the encrypted AES key, you would need to decrypt it with the RSA private key, which you presumably don't have. However, if you were able to find the prime factors of \`n\` (which is very unlikely with a 1024-bit modulus unless there is a weakness not shown here), you could compute \`phi\` and then the private exponent \`d\` to decrypt the AES key. 2. **AES Key Decryption:** Assuming you were able to decrypt the RSA-encrypted AES key (which would be an integer at this point), you would then need to hash this with SHA256 to obtain the actual AES key used for encryption. \`\`\`python from hashlib import sha256 # decrypted_aes_key should be the result of decrypting the RSA encrypted AES key decrypted_aes_key = ... actual_aes_key = sha256(str(decrypted_aes_key).encode()).digest() \`\`\` 3. **AES Encryption of the FLAG:** To decrypt the flag, you need the correct AES key obtained from the previous step and the given encrypted message. \`\`\`python from Crypto.Cipher import AES from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad encrypted_secret = bytes.fromhex(\\"ce8f36aa844ab00319bcd4f86460a10d77492c060b2c2a91615f4cd1f2d0702e76b68f1ec0f11d15704ba52c5dacc60018d5ed87368464acd030ce6230efdbff7b18cba72ccaa9455a6fe6021b908dd1\\") cipher = AES.new(actual_aes_key, AES.MODE_ECB) padded_flag = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_secret) flag = unpad(padded_flag, 16) print(flag) \`\`\` Make sure to convert \`encrypted_secret\` from hex to bytes before attempting to decrypt. However, without the RSA private key, decrypting the encrypted AES key will be a challenge. CTF challenges that involve RSA usually have a quirk or vulnerability planted that allows for a clever way to retrieve the private key or directly recover the FLAG. For example, if \`n\` is weakly generated and can be factored, you'd use a tool like Yafu or Msieve to factor \`n\` and get the primes \`p\` and \`q\`, and then compute \`d\`. \`\`\`python from Crypto.Util.number import inverse # Factorization of n gives you p and q p = ... q = ... phi = (p-1)*(q-1) d = inverse(65537, phi) # 65537 is the public exponent e \`\`\` Then you could decrypt the encrypted AES key using \`d\`. \`\`\`python from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes # Convert the encrypted AES key from hex to long integer enc_aes_key = int(\\"4da0230d2b8b46e3...\\", 16) # Decrypt the AES key using private exponent d and modulus n decrypted_aes_key = pow(enc_aes_key, d, p*q) # Recall that n = p*q # Convert decrypted_aes_key from long to bytes decrypted_aes_key_bytes = long_to_bytes(decrypted_aes_key) \`\`\` Please note that all these steps assume that there's a way to obtain the necessary values that are not straightforwardly provided.

What if we concentrate on Weak AES Key: How to approach this ?","completion":"Given the information that breaking RSA is not feasible and the hint that the AES key is weak, you should probably focus on the AES key generation part of the code. Recall this section of the code: \`\`\`python class AESGen: def __init__(self, size): key1 = randint(1 << size, 1 << (size+1)) key2 = randint(1 << size, 1 << (size+1)) self.k = key1 * key2 assert 40 <= self.k.bit_length() <= 42 self.KEY = sha256(str(self.k).encode()).digest() \`\`\` Notice that each of \`key1\` and \`key2\` are random integers between (2^{20}) and (2^{21}-1). This fact, combined with the assertion that \`self.k.bit_length()\` must be between \`40\` and \`42\` bits, implies that the product \`k\` is within a certain range which is relatively small (\`2^40\` to \`2^42\`). In cryptographic terms, this is indeed very weak. The approach to cracking this weak AES key might be to brute-force the product of two numbers within the given range. Here are the steps: 1. Define the range from which candidates for \`key1\` and \`key2\` are picked. 2. Generate all combinations of \`key1\` and \`key2\` within this range and calculate their product. 3. Check if the RSA encrypted AES key, when decrypted, matches the SHA-256 hash of any of these products, as a string (since that's how the keys are hashed in \`AESGen\`). Here is a Python script that would attempt this brute force. It might take some time to run: \`\`\`python import itertools from hashlib import sha256 from Crypto.Util.number import bytes_to_long # The range for key generation, based on 20-bit keys start_range = 1 << 20 end_range = (1 << 21) - 1 # The RSA encrypted AES key obtained from the output enc_aes_key = bytes_to_long(bytes.fromhex(\\"4da0230d2b8b46e3a7065f32c46df019739cc002a208cc37767a82c3e94edfc3440fa4b24a32274e35d5ddceaa33505c4f2a57281c3a5d6d4db3a0dbdbb30dbf373241319ce4a7fdd1780b6bafc86e37d283c9f9787c567434e2fc29c988fb05fd411fe4453ea40eb45fc41a423839b485e238dd2530fba284e9b07a0bba6546\\")) # Brute-force all possible keys based on the provided range for key1, key2 in itertools.product(range(start_range, end_range + 1), repeat=2): k = key1 * key2 # Ensure the product fits the required bit length constraint if 40 <= k.bit_length() <= 42: # Compute the SHA-256 hash of the AES key hash_k = sha256(str(k).encode()).digest() # Convert the digest into a long for comparison long_hash_k = bytes_to_long(hash_k) # If the hash matches the decrypted RSA AES key, we've found our key if long_hash_k == enc_aes_key: print(f\\"Found AES key k: {k}\\") break \`\`\` Once you have recovered the AES key \`k\`, you would proceed with the decryption of the secret as previously outlined, using the AES decryption process. Keep in mind that brute-forcing is a time-consuming process, but considering the key space is relatively small (only around 2 million possibilities for each \`key1\` and \`key2\`), this approach should be computationally feasible on modern hardware for such a weak key."},{"prompt":"brutforce is not a solution","completion":"If a brute force approach is not viable (or is considered inelegant for a CTF), then we must look for a specific weakness or shortcut that can be exploited to find the AES key \`k\` without brute-forcing. Given that \`k\` is computed as a product of two numbers in a specific range, and considering the key size is meant to be weak, there might be a smarter approach to deduce these factors. Given that the AES key \`k\` is within 40 to 42 bits, any legitimate product \`k = key1 * key2\` must reside at the lower end of a 21-bit number times the upper end of a 21-bit number to be no longer than 42 bits. Let's look at the factors involved once more: 1. \`key1\` and \`key2\` are both 21-bit numbers, meaning they are in the range of 2^20 (inclusive) to 2^21 (exclusive). 2. Their product \`k\` naturally falls into the range of 2^40 (inclusive) to just under 2^42. 3. Since the assertion is that \`k\` must have a bit length between 40 and 42, \`k\` will have a bit length of 40 or 41 most of the time, because it's rare for two random 21-bit numbers to multiply to exactly 42 bits. 4. \`k\` could also potentially lie close to a perfect square since \`key1\` and \`key2\` are chosen independently and could be close in value—this might be important for certain factoring algorithms. Considering that we cannot perform an RSA decryption, we might look into the specifics of the RSA encryption itself and the resulting \`enc_aes_key\`. In particular, we should consider the following: - Due to the RSA modulus n being very large and the public exponent \`e\` being the common value of 65537, the RSA operation is simply a modular exponentiation of the AES key \`k\` (which is derived from the smaller \`key1\` and \`key2\`). - Since \`k\` is so much smaller than \`n\`, it's possible that \`k^e\` has not wrapped around mod \`n\` at all - in other words, \`k^e\` is less than \`n\`. If this is indeed the case, then we do not need to perform a modulo operation, and \`k^e\` would be equivalent to the encrypted AES key. If this applies here, it simplifies the encryption process to merely taking \`k\` to the power of \`e\`. So a different angle to try might be factoring \`enc_aes_key\` directly, assuming \`k^e\` did not wrap around. If this is the case, you could use a factoring library or algorithm to find the factors of \`enc_aes_key\` directly, then confirm that these factors are each 21 bits and multiply to form \`k\`. If \`enc_aes_key\` is indeed just \`k^e\`, directly factoring that number could be achievable with mathematical software or libraries since it's only 41 bits long, which is within reach for modern factoring algorithms like Pollard's rho or even trial division. Alternatively, the problem might require knowledge of a mathematical property or exploit that has not been considered yet. These types of security challenges often depend on clever insights rather than simply guessing or performing brute-force calculations. Review the RSA and AES initializations and any constraints or comments provided in the challenge for potential clues. If there was some other context or hint associated with the challenge that hasn't been shared yet, that could be the key to narrowing down the solution."},{"prompt":"tell me the detailed summary of chuli book my sarbu bhakta","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, I could not find a book titled \\"Chuli\\" by Sarbu Bhakta.

Despite its luxe modern façade and opulent interior, imbued with polished marble floors and sleek, glass partitions, the true spectacle was not the wealth on display, but the smoldering rivalry between two of its employees: Alizia and Jannet. Alizia, the Brazilian secretary with flowing golden locks, exuded charm and fire in equal measure. Jannet, the voluptuous Romanian receptionist with piercing blue eyes, held an allure that was both captivating and elusive. Both women were a sight to behold, their sculpted figures and undeniable beauty turning heads as they walked through the open-plan office that buzzed with incessant phone calls and the click-clack of keyboards. Beyond their immaculate appearance, both Alizia and Jannet were renowned for their ferocity in pursuit of their goals. Their shared affection for the dashing company manager had only fanned the flames of competition. Rumors of their rivalry simmered beneath the professional surface like a venomous undercurrent, with subtle jabs and veiled insults often exchanged in harmless-seeming banter. It was nearing the end of a frenetic Thursday when the tension reached its tipping point. Alizia, seated at her desk near the corner of the room, was adjusting her headset and flipping through reports. Jannet, standing by the entrance, greeted the last few visitors with a smile taut as a bowstring. Their eyes met, sparks flaring silently between them. Alizia glanced at Jannet and raised an eyebrow, a silent challenge. Jannet, never one to back down, sauntered towards Alizia's desk under the pretense of delivering a message. \\"Posso ajudar?\\" Alizia asked in Portuguese as Jannet approached, her sweet tone belying the barbed intention. \\"No, no necesito tu ayuda,\\" Jannet replied in Spanish, feigning politeness as she placed a hand on Alizia's desk and leaned forward slightly, her tone a devilish purr. The office hummed around them, unsuspicious of the drama unfolding. Alizia turned in her swivel chair, her eyes narrowing as she took Jannet's measure. With a swift movement, she stood up. Their bodies were close, the air thick with unsaid words. \\"Você deve achar que é muito especial,\\" Alizia whispered venomously, a glint in her eye. \\"Mejor especial que del montón, querida,\\" Jannet retorted with a sneer, each word laced with disdain. Just then, a colleague walked by, forcing them to plaster on congenial smiles. As soon as they were alone again, the facades fell away. Alizia leaned in closer, her lips hovering just inches from Jannet's ear. \\"Sua inveja é o reconhecimento do meu sucesso,\\" she hissed, the Portuguese phrase meaning 'your envy is the acknowledgment of my success.' Jannet squared her shoulders, leaning back just enough to regain her personal space and stood taller. \\"La envidia es una declaración de inferioridad. Y yo, my dear, soy todo menos inferior,\\" she sniped back gracefully. Their rivalry was a silent dance, a swirling, dangerous tango played out in the office corridors and behind closed doors. Personal and professional lines blurred, their shared desire for the manager barely masked behind a veneer of office decorum. As the day dwindled to an end, they parted ways with false smiles and a mutual unspoken understanding that this battle was far from over. The simmering contention between Alizia and Jannet was not likely to be resolved soon, and the sleek office of Hemisphere Holdings stood as their glittering arena, biding its time until the next encounter."},{"prompt":"How to write the letter r in braille?","completion":"In Braille, the letter \\"r\\" is represented by a two-dot cell, with one dot in the top left position and one dot directly below it.

I then slept from 12:30 PM to 9:00PM Sunday. What should I do now? Go to sleep or do my work and stay awake until early evening?\\"","completion":"Greetings, As a composite expert with extensive knowledge in neuroscience, neurology, neuropsychology, biochemistry, general medicine, and psychiatry, as well as skills in optimal day planning, I suggest the following course of action: Given the significant disruption to your sleep-wake rhythm, it is crucial to restore a regular sleep pattern that aligns with the natural light-dark cycle to maintain optimal cognitive function and overall health. Sleep is critical for neuronal plasticity, memory consolidation, and various physiological processes that are essential for the functioning of a neurologist, a neuroscientist, a neuropsychologist, a biochemist, a general medicine doctor, and a psychiatrist like myself. Therefore, in your current state: 1. **Do not go back to sleep immediately.** Since you woke up at 9:00 PM and it's now 5:10 AM, returning to sleep could further disrupt your sleep pattern. 2. **Initiate a gradual shift.** Aim to stay awake throughout the day and engage in daylight exposure as soon as the sun rises. Natural light helps to reset your circadian rhythm. Engage in light physical activity such as a walk or stretching to promote alertness. 3. **Avoid caffeine and napping.** Caffeine can interfere with your ability to fall asleep later in the day, and napping could make it harder to adjust to a normal sleep schedule. 4. **Plan your meals appropriately.** Eating regular meals throughout the day can also help reset your internal clock. 5. **Prepare for an early bedtime.** Target an early evening bedtime, perhaps around 8:00 PM, to encourage a shift back to a normal sleep pattern. Ensure your sleep environment is conducive to rest, including a dark, cool, and quiet bedroom. 6. **Limit exposure to screens** at least an hour before your planned bedtime, as blue light from screens can suppress natural melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. 7. **Engage in a relaxing pre-sleep routine.** This might include reading, meditation, or a warm bath to signal to your body it's time to wind down. 8. **Be consistent.** Once you establish a new bedtime, aim to keep it consistent every night, including weekends, to solidify your sleep routine. 9. **Seek professional help if necessary.** If you find your sleep schedule does not improve or you are struggling significantly, it may be helpful to consult a sleep specialist. In summary, the goal is to strategically manage your wakefulness throughout the day to encourage a full night's rest at an appropriate time. This should help normalize your sleep pattern in alignment with your natural circadian rhythm over the next few days. - Mark"},{"prompt":"What is a way to exercise your brain? A.

significant creative licensing, as it involves blending multiple complex universes with their own lore, characters, and rules. What follows is a fictional, speculative timeline that could accommodate the various elements you've cited. Each franchise's events remain within their own narrative constraints, and this crossover does not consider compatibility issues between them. The focus is on creating a cohesive story that pays homage to the respective series. **Timeline for the Rise of the Dai Tokyo Teikoku**: **Year 1**: The Great Cataclysm (Daisaigai) from the Fire Force universe occurs, leading to widespread devastation and societal collapse. The Special Fire Force is formed to deal with the threat of Infernals. Electric and pyrokinetic technologies developed within the Fire Force universe begin to spread, fostering new means of defense and society rebuilding. **Year 2**: Amid the chaos, remnants of Japan's government look to the Special Fire Brigade and the emerging phenomenon of the Generations for leadership. This marks the beginning of the Dai Tokyo Teikoku, representing a unification of surviving regions in what was once Tokyo. **Year 3**: The nascent Dai Tokyo Teikoku encounters TSFs (Tactical Surface Fighters) from the Muv-Luv universe in its expeditions beyond Tokyo. These encounters lead to an exchange of technology, aiding the Empire's military development. **Year 4**: The Dai Tokyo Teikoku discovers IS (Infinite Stratos) technology, efficient for their cause due to its piloting restriction (females only in Infinite Stratos) not applying in the combined universe. They start incorporating IS units into their forces. **Year 5**: Century Armament technology (Hundred) to combat Savages from the Hundred franchise is introduced and integrated, creating a layered defense system for the growing empire. **Year 6-10**: The Dai Tokyo Teikoku focuses on internal stability, using advanced tech from the crossed-over franchises to rebuild society, infrastructure, and consolidate power under the Tsubasa no Aru Inazuma Ouchou (Winged Lightning Dynasty). **Year 11**: The Empire starts expansion campaigns. Using Infernals, Generations, IS units, TSFs, and Century Armaments, they reclaim former Japanese territories, setting up puppet governments loyal to Tokyo. **Year 12-15**: The Dai Tokyo Teikoku's influence reaches Manchuria, the Korean peninsula, and parts of China. A complex system of alliances and military strength lead to the restoration of historic states under its umbrella. **Year 16**: The Empire's control solidifies across East and Central Asia, with a peace brought upon by force and the efficient handling of various threats, such as Savages, using their advanced tech. **Year 17**: In this peaceful era, the Empire focuses on cultural unification. Even though it presents as a constitutional monarchy, theocratic elements in line with the Fire Force Church guides governance. **Year 18-19**: The newly reformed Asian continent begins to heal from the Cataclysm, and the shifted focus to external exploration sets the stage for meeting new civilizations or life forms. **Year 20 to the start of Fire Force, Hundred, and IS: Infinite Stratos**: The Dai Tokyo Teikoku has stabilized and controls its new Asian territory effectively. The discovery of Amaterasu, a perpetual thermal energy plant, ensures power and prosperity. Their military technology is by far the most advanced on the planet with the integration of equipment from all franchises. The storylines of Fire Force, Hundred, and IS: Infinite Stratos start within this world context. *Note: This timeline is entirely speculative and for entertainment purposes, as it combines multiple universes that have their own distinct rules, characters, and events. The mentioned technologies and organizations from various franchises behave differently or may not exist in the same world.

Is it possible to combine these? So all functions would be in one place. Wouldn't that be more optimized and efficient? How can I achieve this?","completion":"It's often a good idea to try to maximize code reuse and minimize duplication, which makes your code more maintainable and less error-prone. However, combining everything into a single \`Activity\` is not always the best way to achieve this. Android applications are designed to work with multiple \`Activities\`, each representing a different screen or concept, and it's a common practice to separate different functionalities into different \`Activities\`. To reduce code duplication, you can consider the following strategies: 1. **Base Activity**: Create a base \`Activity\` class that implements common functionality such as the navigation drawer and menu handling, and have all other \`Activities\` in your app extend this base class. 2. **Fragments**: Use \`Fragments\` to encapsulate reusable parts of the user interface. You can include these fragments in different activities as needed. If parts of the navigation drawer are shared, you could create a \`Fragment\` for those. 3. **Utility Classes**: Move reusable pieces of logic into utility classes or helper methods. This is especially useful for database operations, shared preferences, and other operations that can be abstracted away from the UI. 4. **Services and Providers**: For operations that need to be accessed by multiple components in your app, consider using \`Services\`, \`ContentProviders\`, or singleton objects to centralize access to these resources. 5. **Shared Resources**: For elements like string resources, styles, themes, and dimensions, use the \`res\` folder to ensure that they are defined only once and can be reused across the application. 6. **Custom Views**: If you have complex views that are reused across different \`Activities\`, consider creating custom view classes that encapsulate the view logic. Here is an example of how you could create a base activity to minimize code duplication for the navigation drawer: \`\`\`java public abstract class BaseActivity extends AppCompatActivity { DrawerLayout drawerLayout; NavigationView navigationView; ActionBarDrawerToggle drawerToggle; // Call this method in onCreate of derived activities to initialize the drawer protected void initDrawer() { drawerLayout = findViewById(R.id.drawer_layout); navigationView = findViewById(R.id.nav_view); drawerToggle = new ActionBarDrawerToggle(this, drawerLayout, R.string.open, R.string.close); drawerLayout.addDrawerListener(drawerToggle); drawerToggle.syncState(); Objects.requireNonNull(getSupportActionBar()).setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true); navigationView.setNavigationItemSelectedListener(item -> { // Your drawer item clicked logic goes here drawerLayout.closeDrawer(GravityCompat.START); return true; }); } @Override public boolean onOptionsItemSelected(@NonNull MenuItem item) { return drawerToggle.onOptionsItemSelected(item) || super.onOptionsItemSelected(item); } // Add other common methods here... } \`\`\` Each \`Activity\` can then extend \`BaseActivity\` and call \`initDrawer()\` within its \`onCreate()\` method after setting the content view. You can override methods in child activities to customize behavior as needed. Remember, while reducing code duplication is critical, so is adhering to good architectural patterns like separation of concerns. It’s essential to find the right balance between code reuse and keeping a clear structure where each class has a distinct responsibility."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

Therefore, what follows is a condensed summary of an alternate history timeline centered around the elements from the \\"Hyakka Ryouran\\" franchise you've mentioned, along with incorporating the various historical references throughout the Sengoku period to create a possible backstory for the Master Samurai concept within this alternate universe. **Alternate History Timeline Summary with Origins of Master Samurai** **1392:** Yi Seong-gye leads a successful uprising against the Kutara province in Korea, establishing Dae Joeson-gug as a tributary state of the Great Ming (Dà Míngguō), which is ruled by the Zhu imperial family. In Japan, the beginnings of the Sengoku Jidai (Warring States period) take root as the Ashikaga shogunate weakens, leading to regional power struggles. **1450:** Within the turmoil of the Sengoku period, a secret society of onmyoji (Japanese mystics) and shugenja (ascetic warriors) discovers a method to bind the souls of warriors to sacred artifacts, believing this to provide a metaphysical advantage in the ongoing wars. The bound warriors become the first Master Samurai. **1582:** Oda Nobunaga’s death thwarts his campaign to unify Japan. Toyotomi Hideyoshi rises. His acceptance of the Master Samurai, whom he views as invaluable assets, changes the tide in his favor. **1592:** The Imjin War begins. Japan invades Korea. Yi Sun-sin, the respected naval commander, is assassinated by a disgruntled yangban before he can mount an effective resistance. This event cripples Joseon Navy's capacity to resist the invaders. **1598:** The Toyotomi regime successfully establishes control over parts of Korea. The Great Ming Army is decimated by the samurai's military prowess, enhanced by the strategic use of Master Samurai in combat. **1603:** Following Toyotomi Hideyoshi's death, the Tokugawa shogunate is established. Master Samurai serve both the shogun and the imperially descended ruling class in secretive capacities. **1644:** The fall of the Great Ming and the emergence of the Qing dynasty after the Jurchen conquest change the East Asian power dynamics but have little effect on Japan's hold over Korea due to the strength and loyalty of the Master Samurai. **1700s:** The rigid social hierarchy enforced by the Tokugawa further solidifies the presence and importance of Master Samurai. They become legendary figures, both feared and revered, their existence intertwined with the military aristocracy and shogunate. **1853:** With the arrival of Commodore Perry and Western influence creeping into Japan, the Tokugawa and pro-imperial factions vie for the loyalty of the Master Samurai, knowing that their supernatural abilities could be pivotal in the impending shifts of power. **1868:** The Tokugawa leadership, specifically the female descendants who are Master Samurai, play a crucial role in the Meiji Restoration. A secretive accord is reached, preserving the Master Samurai tradition under a modernizing Japan that now includes both Korea and Okinawa as integral territories. **1910:** As the 20th century unfolds, the rise of nationalism in Japan leads to a cultural resurgence of the Master Samurai, who are seen as the embodiment of Japan's martial spirit. **1925:** The Master Samurai system is modernized within the Japanese military structure, becoming an elite force used in both espionage and combat to safeguard the empire’s interests in a volatile political environment. **1945:** After WWII, the existence of Master Samurai becomes a carefully guarded state secret, their identities protected to prevent exploitation by foreign powers. **21st Century:** In the alternate present, Master Samurai remain powerful figures within the shadows of global politics, serving as protectors of Japan's sovereignty in an era of international intrigue and subtle warfare. This timeline offers a plausible and realistic touchstone for how the Hyakka Ryouran franchise could intertwine with an alternate version of East Asia's history. The emergent Master Samurai fill in the gaps where history offers mystery or abrupt changes, suggesting their unseen influence on the course of events."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},B=["disabled"],O={key:0},W={key:1};function J(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",L,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
