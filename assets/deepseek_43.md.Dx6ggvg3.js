Green candies: Kaz eats all the green candies, so 0 remain. 2. Orange candies: Kaz eats 60% of the orange candies. 60% of 60 orange candies = 0.60 * 60 = 36 candies eaten. Remaining orange candies = 60 - 36 = 24 candies. 3. Red candies: Kaz eats 2/3 of the red candies. 2/3 of 50 red candies = (2/3) * 50 = 100/3 ≈ 33.33 candies eaten. Remaining red candies = 50 - 33.33 ≈ 16.67 candies. 4. Blue candies: Kaz eats 0.7 of the blue candies. 0.7 of 70 blue candies = 0.7 * 70 = 49 candies eaten. Remaining blue candies = 70 - 49 = 21 candies. 5. Yellow candies: Kaz eats 5/9 of the yellow candies. 5/9 of 80 yellow candies = (5/9) * 80 = 400/9 ≈ 44.44 candies eaten. Remaining yellow candies = 80 - 44.44 ≈ 35.56 candies. 6. Violet candies: Kaz eats 8/15 of the violet candies. 8/15 of 90 violet candies = (8/15) * 90 = 48 candies eaten. Remaining violet candies = 90 - 48 = 42 candies. 7. Indigo candies: Kaz does not eat any indigo candies, so 100 remain. Now, let's calculate the total number of remaining candies before the final step: Remaining candies = 0 (green) + 24 (orange) + 16.67 (red) + 21 (blue) + 35.56 (yellow) + 42 (violet) + 100 (indigo) Remaining candies = 239.23 Kaz wants the total number of remaining candies of all colors to equal 220. Therefore, he needs to eat: 239.23 - 220 = 19.23 candies Since he eats red, blue, and yellow candies in equal proportions, he will eat 19.23 / 3 ≈ 6.41 candies of each color. Let's subtract these from the remaining candies of each color: Remaining red candies = 16.67 - 6.41 ≈ 10.26 candies Remaining blue candies = 21 - 6.41 ≈ 14.59 candies Remaining yellow candies = 35.56 - 6.41 ≈ 29.15 candies Now, we need to find what percent of the original red candies remain: Percent of original red candies remaining = (10.26 / 50) * 100 ≈ 20.52% Therefore, approximately boxed{20.52%} of the original red candies remain."},{"prompt":"Consider a 5digit number d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5 special if the prefix d_1d_2 is exactly the same as either d_3d_4 or d_4d_5.

Our goal is to perform the operation of deleting one edge from cycles of length 4 until no more such cycles can be found. We need to find the configuration that results in the minimum number of edges remaining. 3. **Cyclic Deletion Operation**: - Consider a cycle of length 4 in a graph, say, vertices A, B, C, and D forming a cycle with edges AB, BC, CD, and DA. - Delete an edge from this cycle, for example, edge AB. - The resulting graph will still be connected but has one less edge. 4. **Graph Properties**: - The graph G we start with, K_n, is connected and not bipartite (as it contains odd cycles, specifically triangles). - After deleting edges as described, the resulting graph H remains non-bipartite (since any even-length cycle still has chords or adjacent nodes maintaining connectivity). 5. **Maintaining Connectivity**: - If a graph is connected and not a bipartite, it must have at least n-1 edges because if it had exactly n-1, it would be a tree and thus bipartite. - Therefore, the resulting non-bipartite and connected graph from our operation will have at least n edges. 6. **Constructing a Graph with n Edges**: - Initially, K_n has frac{n(n-1)}{2} edges. - To construct a graph with exactly n edges, we begin with K_n and systematically remove edges according to the deletion operation from cycles of length 4. 7. **Explicit Construction Example**: - Label vertices A1, A2, ..., A(n-3), X, Y, Z such that we can clearly define cycles of length 4. - Remove edge A_iA_j from cycles formed including X, Y, and A_i, A_j where 1 leq i < j leq n-3. - Also remove edges XA_i from cycles formed by XYZ, enclosing A_i for 1 leq i leq n-3. - Do the same for edges YA_j with 1 leq j leq n-3. - The remaining graph will eventually have exactly n edges and no cycle of length 4 where an edge can be deleted anymore. # Conclusion: Based on the discussion and construction, the minimum number of edges that can be achieved through this operation on a complete graph with n vertices is n.

Because f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}, f'(x) must be non-negative for all x in mathbb{R}: f'(x) = a - cos x geq 0. This inequality must hold for all x, which means it must hold for the minimum value of cos x. Since the minimum value of cos x is -1, we have: a - (-1) geq 0 implies a geq 1. So, the range of the real number a is a geq 1 and the result is boxed{a geq 1}. (2) Now consider a = frac{1}{2}. The derivative of f(x) becomes: f'(x) = frac{1}{2} - cos x. To find the critical points, set f'(x) = 0: frac{1}{2} - cos x = 0 implies cos x = frac{1}{2}. The critical point in the interval left[0, frac{pi}{2}right] is x = frac{pi}{3}, since cos left(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{1}{2}. To determine whether this critical point is a maximum or minimum, investigate the sign of the derivative f'(x) around x = frac{pi}{3}: - When x in left[0, frac{pi}{3}right), cos x > frac{1}{2} so f'(x) < 0.

Thus, the function f(x) has a minimum at x = frac{pi}{3}. To find the maximum value, we need to evaluate f(x) at the endpoints of the interval left[0, frac{pi}{2}right].

An even positive integer can be represented as ( 2k ), where ( k ) is a positive integer. Thus, the first ( m ) even positive integers are ( 2, 4, 6, ldots, 2m ).

We need to show that there are no positive integers ( m ) and ( n ) such that this equation holds. Observe that the left-hand side, ( n(n+1) ), is always the product of two consecutive integers, and hence is even (since the product of any two consecutive integers is even). 5.

For ( n ) and ( n+1 ) to generate purely the structure ( 2k(2k+1)), the matching ( n ) and ( m ) would have to align more than just in parity. 7.

Therefore, we have: [301(1 + x)^2 = 500] This equation represents the relationship between the monthly average growth rate x and the increase in the number of smart charging piles from the first month to the third month.

Please explain the reason.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Calculation of y_{A} and y_{B} - For Store A: - The cost of 16 badminton rackets is 16 times 150 yuan. - Since Teacher Huang buys more than 16 boxes of shuttlecocks, she gets 16 boxes for free due to the promotion, and pays for the remaining x - 16 boxes. - The cost for the remaining shuttlecocks is (x - 16) times 40 yuan. - Therefore, the total cost at Store A is y_{A} = 16 times 150 + (x - 16) times 40 = 2400 + 40x - 640 = 1760 + 40x yuan. - For Store B: - The original cost without discount for 16 badminton rackets and x boxes of shuttlecocks is (16 times 150) + (40x) yuan. - Store B offers a 20% discount on the total cost, so the total cost at Store B is y_{B} = 80% times [(16 times 150) + (40x)] = 0.8 times (2400 + 40x) = 1920 + 32x yuan. Therefore, the expressions for y_{A} and y_{B} are: y_{A} = 1760 + 40x quad text{and} quad y_{B} = 1920 + 32x So, we have y_{A} = 1760 + 40x yuan and y_{B} = 1920 + 32x yuan.

Therefore, it is more cost-effective for Teacher Huang to buy the badminton rackets and shuttlecocks at Store B when x=25. The final answers are encapsulated as follows: - For part (1): y_{A} = boxed{1760 + 40x} yuan and y_{B} = boxed{1920 + 32x} yuan. - For part (2): It is more cost-effective to buy at Store B, encapsulated as boxed{text{Store B}}."},{"prompt":"Shifting the graph of the function y=sin (2x+varphi) to the right by dfrac {1}{4} of a period results in a graph that is symmetric about the yaxis.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 5, 9, and 11 can be found by multiplying the highest powers of prime factors present in each number. However, since 5, 9, and 11 are relatively prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the LCM is simply their product: LCM(5, 9, 11) = 5 * 9 * 11 = 45 * 11 = 495 Now, we want to find a multiple of 495 that is less than 997 and leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, 9, and 11. To leave a remainder of 3, we would add 3 to a multiple of 495: Multiple of 495 + 3 = Number less than 997 Let's find the largest multiple of 495 that is less than 997: 997 - 3 = 994 Now, we divide 994 by 495 to find the largest multiple: 994 ÷ 495 = 2 (with a remainder) The largest multiple of 495 that is less than 994 is 2 * 495 = 990. Now, we add 3 to 990 to get the number that would leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, 9, and 11: 990 + 3 = 993 So, 993 is the number that, when divided by 5, 9, and 11, will leave a remainder of 3. To find the least number that should be subtracted from 997 to get 993, we subtract 993 from 997: 997 - 993 = 4 Therefore, the least number that should be subtracted from 997 so that the remainder when divided by 5, 9, and 11 will leave in each case the same remainder of 3 is boxed{4} ."},{"prompt":"Robin initially had 300 songs on her mp3 player.

For each of these pairs, the following calculation is required: - **Case 1: Without the digit \\"0\\" being used** (pairs including the digit 0): - Pair ((0, 9)) - There are 8 digits used excluding 0 and 9, giving 8! ways to arrange the remaining digits. - But since 0 cannot be the first digit, we have: [ 8 times 7! ] - **Case 2: With the digit \\"0\\"** being used (all other pairs): - Pairs: ((1, 8)), ((2, 7)), ((3, 6)), ((4, 5)) - Excluding the digit pair whose sum is 9, leaves 8 digits. - Arranging these 8 digits where 0 cannot be the first digit gives: [ 7 times 7! ] 8. Therefore, combining all cases: - For ((0, 9)) pair: (8 times 7!) - For each of the other 4 pairs: (4 times 7 times 7!) 9. Hence total number ways is: [ (8 times 7!) + 4 times (7 times 7!) ] 10. Since (7! = 5040), the calculation proceeds as: [ (8 times 5040) + 4 times (7 times 5040) ] [ 40320 + 142560 = 181440 ] Conclusion: [ boxed{181440} ]"},{"prompt":"Prove that no matter how we select twenty (different) numbers from the first hundred natural numbers, we can find four among them such that the sum of the first two equals the sum of the other two.","completion":"1. **Introduction**: Let's prove the claim for 16 numbers instead of 20. We'll show that any selection of 16 distinct numbers from the first 100 natural numbers contains subsets where the sum of one pair equals the sum of another pair. 2. **Counting Pairs**: If we choose any 16 numbers, we can form frac{16 cdot 15}{2} = 120 different pairs. These pairs are formed by taking all combinations of two numbers from the 16 selected. 3. **Range of Sums**: Among these 120 pairs, the sums differ. The smallest possible sum we can have from two numbers chosen from 1 to 100 is 1 + 2 = 3, and the largest possible sum is 99 + 100 = 199. Therefore, there are at most 199 - 3 + 1 = 197 possible different sums. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle**: By the pigeonhole principle, since we have 120 pairs and 197 possible sums, it must be true that there is a repetition in sums. Since 120 > 99, at least two of these pairs must have the same sum. 5. **Symmetric Arrangements**: Let's assume our selected sums lead to pairs of the form (z, y, x) and they can repeat. Because the principle laid out shows that with our constraints, at least 21 sums will be the same (since 120 text{ pairs} - 99 text{ unique sums} = 21 over repetitions). 6. **Constructing the Pairs**: If we look for such repetition, we direct our approach towards symmetry: z - y = y - x We can restructure this equation to: z + x = 2y Let’s generalize this. We want to find multiple occurrences of these pairings among our 16 numbers. Since our constraints limit the middle number y to occur distinctively at least 14 times within such triples, we get: z_{1} neq z_{2}, ( x_{1} neq x_{2}, and a common y Therefore, we can assert: z_{1} + x_{1} = 2 y = z_{2} + x_{2} 7. **Final Structure**: Provided these conditions, x_{1}, x_{2}, z_{1}, and z_{2} are unique and distinct values. 8. **Additional Repetition**: If we assume without further symmetric pairs, here's the critical scenario: For the remaining at least seven repetitions, in which symmetry was not confined nor violated by z from w, then we assert x, y, z, w distinct: x - y = z - w Simplifies to: x + w = y + z 9. **Conclusion**: By proving through construction intervals and the pigeonhole principle, we ascertain we can always form subsets totaling sums for pairs. # Conclusion: Thus, we confirm that it is impossible to choose 16 distinct numbers from the first 100 natural numbers without finding at least one set of four numbers where the sum of one pair equals the sum of another pair. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"The salary of a worker is first increased by some percentage and afterwards reduced by 15%.

We aim to prove that triangle HBC_{1} is equilateral. If we do so, then angle BAC = angle BC_{1}C = 60^{circ} follows immediately, which, combined with the given condition, leads to the final answer. 4.

Then this means ( a_{p-n} + a_n = a_{q-n} + a_n = r ) for some prime ( r ). Since ( p > q ge 3 ), this means there is a positive integer ( k ) which lies strictly between ( p ) and ( q ), where ( k ) is composite. Since ( a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots ) is an increasing sequence, this means that ( a_{k-n} + a_n = r ), which implies that ( a_{k-n} + a_n ) is prime. However, from ( P(k-n, n) ): [ tau(k) = tau(a_{k-n} + a_n) implies tau(k) = 2 ] which implies that ( k ) is prime, which is a contradiction. (blacksquare) 4. Now, we prove Claim 2. Let ( m ) be the smallest prime such that ( 2^{m-2} > p ), and let ( S ) be the set of all positive integers less than ( 2^{m-2} ) which are of the form ( q-n ) for some prime ( q ), and ( T ) be the set ( {s_k mid k in S} ). Since ( s_k < s_{2^{m-2}} = 2^{m-2} ), this means all the elements of ( T ) must be less than ( 2^{m-2} ) as well. We know that all of the elements from ( T ) must be of the form ( p-n ) as well, which implies that ( T subseteq S ). Furthermore, according to Subclaim 2.1, we find that ( a_{p-n} ne a_{q-n} ) for any primes ( p ) and ( q ) satisfying ( p > q > n ge 2 ). This implies that all the elements of ( T ) are distinct. This shows that ( |S| = |T| ), which implies that ( S = T ). Therefore, ( a_{p-n} = p-n ) for all ( n ) and prime ( p ) satisfying ( p > n ge 2 ). (blacksquare) 5. Finally, we use induction to complete the proof that ( a_n = n ) for all positive integers ( n ). The base cases are when ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 2 ), which easily follows from Claim 1. For the inductive step, suppose that we know that ( a_n = n ) for all ( n = 1, 2, 3, ldots, k ). According to Bertrand's Postulate, there exists a prime ( p ) such that ( k < p < 2k ). Also, ( p - k < 2k - k = k ). From our induction hypothesis, this implies that ( a_{p-k} = p - k ). Hence, from Claim 2: [ a_k + a_{p-k} = p implies a_k + (p - k) = p implies a_k = k ] which completes the proof.

Notice that for any integer (x), (x(x + 3)) is always even because it is the product of two consecutive integers and one of them is definitely even. Therefore, (x(x + 3)) is even, meaning (x(x + 3) + 1) is always odd since an even number plus one is odd. 3. Consequently, (x^2 + 3x + 1) and (y^2 + 3y + 1) are always odd for any integer (x) and (y). 4.

Therefore, ( b neq 0 ). 3. Let's check if ( a = 0 ): - If ( a = 0 ), then the equation becomes ( 0 = b^2(b - c) ), which simplifies to ( b^3 - b^2 c = 0 ). - This implies ( b^2 (b - c) = 0 ). - Since ( b neq 0 ), we must have ( b - c = 0 ), which implies ( b = c ). - This contradicts the problem's condition that exactly one number is zero and not two.

What is the maximum number of pairwise dissimilar numbers that can be chosen?","completion":"To determine the maximum number of pairwise non-similar 100-digit numbers composed only of the digits 1 and 2, we need to understand the conditions under which two such numbers are considered similar. Let's prove that two numbers are similar if and only if the count of 1's at each residue position 5k + r (where k ranges from 0 to 19, and r ranges from 0 to 4) is the same for both numbers. Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Understanding residue classes:** - Effectively, the number can be thought of as divided into segments where each segment corresponds to positions of the form 5k + r. - There are five such segments based on the value of r: r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 2. **Classifying similar numbers:** - The class of similar numbers is uniquely determined by an ordered 5-tuple (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5). - Here, x_r equals the number of 1's in the positions of the form 5k + r for each r. 3. **Possible values for each tuple entry:** - Each x_r can take any value from 0 to 20 because the positions of type 5k + r add up to 20 positions in total. Therefore, the number of such unique 5-tuples is (21^5). 4. **Necessity of the condition:** - If you apply a swap operation (which is swapping blocks of five consecutive digits), the count of 1's in each segment remains unchanged. - Henceforth, the total count of 1's in any segment 5k + r remains the same, ensuring the numbers stay similar by definition. 5. **Sufficiency of the condition:** - If two numbers share the same counts of 1's for all residue positions, any permutation cycle can be reduced to a series of adjacent swaps that ultimately keep the residue counts unchanged. - By repeatedly applying the defined operation, one number can be transformed into the other (cyclic permutations on 3-cycle basis), proving the sufficiency.

If folded along the second diagonal, the visible area remains S. 3. **Assumptions and contradiction approach**: - Assume S_{1} < frac{2}{3}S. We need to show that this leads to a contradiction. - Consider the set of all \\"dirty\\" points P such that P and g(P) (its symmetric along one of the medial lines) are both covered by dark spots. - The total area of such points is 2(S - S_{1}), which must satisfy: [ 2(S - S_{1}) > frac{2}{3}S ] Simplifying the inequality, we get: [ S - S_{1} > frac{1}{3}S implies S_{1} < frac{2}{3}S ] - Similarly for the fold along the first diagonal, the area of points covered by dark spots and their symmetric pairs is greater than frac{2}{3}S. 4. **Overlap of dirty regions**: - By considering the intersection properties of geometry, if we denote s_{1} and s_{2} as the areas of two figures, and their union is no more than S, then their intersection must be at least: [ s_{1} + s_{2} - S ] - Applying this to our sets, the area of points P such that one of f(g(P)), h(P) is covered by dark spots is at least: [ frac{2}{3}S + frac{2}{3}S - S = frac{1}{3}S ] 5. **Contradiction**: - We observe that the area of points such that h(f(g(P))) is a dirty point must be greater than zero. However, from our definition h(f(g(P))) = k(P), and by problem conditions, this should result in an area of zero contradiction to our assumption.

For small ducks, since more than 10 were purchased, there's a 10% discount: 300.00 * 10% = 30.00 discount 300.00 - 30.00 = 270.00 after discount For medium ducks, since more than 15 were purchased, there's a 15% discount: 663.00 * 15% = 99.45 discount 663.00 - 99.45 = 563.55 after discount For large ducks, since more than 20 were purchased, there's a 20% discount: 925.00 * 20% = 185.00 discount 925.00 - 185.00 = 740.00 after discount Now, let's calculate the sales tax for each size.

The watches were sold at a loss of 7.5%, so the selling price of each watch is ( C - 0.075C = 0.925C ). If they were sold for Rs. 265 more each, the selling price would be ( 0.925C + 265 ). This new selling price would result in a gain of 5.3% on the total transaction. Since there are three watches, the total cost price is ( 3C ), and the total selling price for a 5.3% gain would be ( 3C + 0.053 cdot 3C = 3C(1 + 0.053) = 3C cdot 1.053 ).

Both shapes are not necessarily convex, and no vertex of one polygon is on a side of the other polygon. 2. **Intersection Possibilities**: Each side of the quadrilateral can intersect with each side of the pentagon. The critical point here is to determine the maximum possible intersection points without any restrictions except the basic geometric constraint that any side can intersect another side at most once. 3. **Calculating Total Intersections**: Consider a single side of the quadrilateral.

From the conditions ( q - 1 nmid m ) and ( r - 1 nmid m ), we can infer that ( q neq 2 ) and ( r neq 2 ). This is because if either ( q ) or ( r ) were 2, then ( q - 1 ) or ( r - 1 ) would be 1, which divides any number ( m ). 3. Since ( q ) and ( r ) are not 2, they must be odd primes. Therefore, both ( q ) and ( r ) are odd. 4. Given that ( q ) and ( r ) are odd, the product ( qr ) is also odd. Thus, ( qr - 1 ) is even. 5. Since ( qr - 1 mid m ) and ( qr - 1 ) is even, ( m ) must be even. This implies that one of the prime divisors of ( m ) must be 2. Therefore, ( p = 2 ). 6. Now, we know ( p = 2 ). This means ( 2 - 1 = 1 mid m ), which is trivially true. 7. Next, we consider the condition ( 3 nmid q + r ). Since ( q ) and ( r ) are odd primes and not equal to 2, they must be greater than 2. Also, ( q neq 3 ) and ( r neq 3 ) because if either were 3, then ( q + r ) would be even, and ( 3 mid q + r ). 8.

If both ( q equiv 2 pmod{3} ) and ( r equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then ( q + r equiv 4 equiv 1 pmod{3} ), which also satisfies ( 3 nmid q + r ). 11. However, we need to check the condition ( qr - 1 mid m ).

Since ( x ) and ( y ) are relatively prime, they cannot both be even. Therefore, ( x ) and ( y ) must be either both odd or one odd and one even. In any case, ( x^2 + xy + y^2 ) is odd, implying that ( p ) is an odd prime. 3. Consider the difference of the two expressions: [ x^2 + 3xy + y^2 - (x^2 + xy + y^2) = 2xy ] Since ( p ) divides both ( x^2 + xy + y^2 ) and ( x^2 + 3xy + y^2 ), it must also divide their difference: [ p mid 2xy ] 4. Since ( p ) is odd, it cannot divide 2. Therefore, ( p ) must divide ( xy ). Given that ( x ) and ( y ) are relatively prime, ( p ) must divide either ( x ) or ( y ), but not both. 5. Next, consider the expression: [ x^2 + xy + y^2 - 3xy = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = (x - y)^2 ] Since ( p mid x^2 + xy + y^2 ) and ( p mid 3xy ), it follows that ( p mid (x - y)^2 ).

First, consider the case when (x = 1). Since (xy = 1), we have (y = 1). 3.

Prove that its legs are equal to (2mn) and (m^2 n^2), and the hypotenuse is equal to (m^2 + n^2), where (m) and (n) are natural numbers.","completion":"We begin by considering a right-angled triangle with integer side lengths a, b (the legs), and c (the hypotenuse). We note that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a, b, and c is 1. This situation describes a Pythagorean triangle, which is a special case of a right triangle. 1. **Parity Condition**: - Both a and b cannot be odd. - If a and b were both odd, then a^2 + b^2 would be even (sum of two odd squares), but not divisible by 4 (since odd squares leave a remainder of 1 modulo 4). Thus, a^2 + b^2 would have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, which contradicts the fact that c^2 (a perfect square) must leave a remainder of either 0 or 1 modulo 4. Therefore, one of a and b must be even. For definiteness, let us assume a is even. 2. **Expressing Terms**: - Let a = 2m, where m is an integer. - Since c is the hypotenuse and odd: [ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = (2m)^2 + b^2 = 4m^2 + b^2 ] - We can represent b and c in terms of another pair of integers r and s: [ c + b = 2r quad text{and} quad c - b = 2s ] These equations imply: [ c = r + s quad text{and} quad b = r - s ] 3. **Solving for r and s**: - Substituting these into our equation for c^2, we get: [ c^2 = (r + s)^2 = r^2 + 2rs + s^2 ] and [ a^2 = 4m^2 = 4rs implies m^2 = rs ] - This shows that rs = m^2. Since the GCD of a, b, and c is 1, r and s must be coprime (they have no common divisor other than 1). 4. **Concluding Values**: - Since r and s are both coprime and their product is a perfect square, they themselves must be perfect squares. Let us assign: [ r = n^2 quad text{and} quad s = k^2 ] However, since we need positive integer side lengths and ensuring a remains even: [ b = m^2 - n^2 quad text{and} quad c = m^2 + n^2 ] Thus, we have: [ a = 2mn ] summarizing the results: [ boxed{a = 2mn, ; b = m^2 - n^2, ; c = m^2 + n^2} ] 5. **Verification**: - To show that a^2 + b^2 = c^2, we substitute: [ (2mn)^2 + (m^2 - n^2)^2 = 4m^2n^2 + m^4 - 2m^2n^2 + n^4 = m^4 + 2m^2n^2 + n^4 = (m^2 + n^2)^2 = c^2 ] This verifies that our derived formulas satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, and thus the proof is complete. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A train 110 m long is running with a speed of 50 km/h.

Relative speed = Speed of train + Speed of man Relative speed = 13.89 m/s + 1.39 m/s = 15.28 m/s Now, we can find the time it takes for the train to pass the man by dividing the length of the train by the relative speed.

Now, let's define the brightness levels for the colored lights relative to the medium brightness: - Low brightness = 0.5 units (since it's lower than medium) - Medium brightness = 1 unit (same as white lights) - High brightness = 1.5 units (since it's higher than medium) Let's calculate the total brightness of the colored lights Malcolm bought: - Red lights: 16 low brightness = 16 * 0.5 = 8 units - Yellow lights: 4 high brightness = 4 * 1.5 = 6 units - Blue lights: 2 times the number of yellow lights with medium brightness = 2 * 4 = 8 medium brightness blue lights = 8 * 1 = 8 units - Green lights: 8 low brightness = 8 * 0.5 = 4 units - Purple lights: 3 high brightness = 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 units Now, let's calculate the additional lights he needs to buy: - Additional blue lights: 25% more than the current 8 blue lights = 0.25 * 8 = 2 additional blue lights with medium brightness = 2 * 1 = 2 units - Additional red lights: 10 low brightness = 10 * 0.5 = 5 units Adding all the brightness units together: 8 (red) + 6 (yellow) + 8 (blue) + 4 (green) + 4.5 (purple) + 2 (additional blue) + 5 (additional red) = 37.5 units Since each white light has a medium brightness of 1 unit, the number of white lights Malcolm had initially is equal to the total brightness units of the colored lights: 37.5 units = 37.5 white lights Since we can't have a fraction of a light, Malcolm had boxed{38} white lights initially (rounding up to the nearest whole light)."},{"prompt":"Given that F_1 and F_2 are the left and right foci of the ellipse frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > b > 0), O is the origin, and point P(1,frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) lies on the ellipse, with the eccentricity of the ellipse being frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

We are given a problem involving 36 identical gifts placed in 8 different bags, with the number of gifts in each bag being at least 1 and all different. Hence, we can distribute the gifts among the bags as follows: each bag contains (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) gifts respectively. This is confirmed by checking: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = frac{8 times (8 + 1)}{2} = 36 ] 2. In this problem, we need to choose some bags such that the total number of gifts in the chosen bags is a multiple of 8. Summarize the possible distributions based on multiples of 8.

This implies that ( A^T = -A ). 2. **Eigenvalues of Antisymmetric Matrices**: The eigenvalues of a real antisymmetric matrix are either zero or purely imaginary. To see why, suppose ( lambda ) is an eigenvalue of ( A ) with corresponding eigenvector ( v ). Then: [ Av = lambda v ] Taking the conjugate transpose of both sides, we get: [ v^* A^* = overline{lambda} v^* ] Since ( A ) is real and antisymmetric, ( A^* = A^T = -A ).

Using the angle addition formulas: [ 1 + cos varphi = 2 cos^2 frac{varphi}{2} quad text{and} quad sin varphi = 2 sin frac{varphi}{2} cos frac{varphi}{2} ] 4. Therefore: [ 1 + z = 2 cos^2 frac{varphi}{2} + 2 i sin frac{varphi}{2} cos frac{varphi}{2} = 2 cos frac{varphi}{2} left( cos frac{varphi}{2} + i sin frac{varphi}{2} right) ] 5. Now: [ z(1 + z)^n = e^{i varphi} left( 2 cos frac{varphi}{2} right)^n left( cos frac{varphi}{2} + i sin frac{varphi}{2} right)^n ] 6. Simplify using ( left( cos frac{varphi}{2} + i sin frac{varphi}{2} right)^n = cos frac{n varphi}{2} + i sin frac{n varphi}{2} ): [ 2^n cos^n frac{varphi}{2} left( cos varphi + i sin varphi right) left( cos frac{n varphi}{2} + i sin frac{n varphi}{2} right) ] 7. This becomes: [ 2^n cos^n frac{varphi}{2} left( cos left( varphi + frac{n varphi}{2} right) + i sin left( varphi + frac{n varphi}{2} right) right) ] 8. Therefore, the real part is: [ 2^n cos^n frac{varphi}{2} cos frac{(n+2) varphi}{2} ] 9. So, the sum of the series is: [ boxed{2^n cos^n frac{varphi}{2} cos frac{(n+2) varphi}{2}} ] Part (d) Consider the series: [ S = sin varphi + binom{n}{1} sin 2 varphi + ldots + binom{n}{n} sin (n+1) varphi. ] 1. Similar to part (c), we recognize the series as the imaginary part of: [ z(1 + z)^n ] 2. Using the same intermediate expressions, the imaginary part will be: [ 2^n cos^n frac{varphi}{2} sin frac{(n+2) varphi}{2} ] 3.

Since the two lines are perpendicular, the first condition is satisfied. However, line l_1 does not pass through the point (-3, -1), so we discard this solution. For the case where b neq 0, since lines l_1 and l_2 are perpendicular, their slopes must be negative reciprocals of each other. Therefore, we have frac{a}{b} cdot (1 - a) = -1.

Solving this system of equations, we find a = 2 and b = 2. Hence, (boxed{a = 2, b = 2}.) (2) Since l_1 is parallel to l_2, their slopes must be equal; hence, frac{a}{b} = 1 - a.

In what ratio does point (P) divide side (AC)?","completion":"1. **Symmetric Point Construction**: Consider the symmetric point M' of point M with respect to the line AC. Due to the symmetry and the geometric properties of the equilateral triangle ABC, we can utilize the symmetric point to ease our calculation. 2. **Angle Considerations**: Notice that angle MPC = angle M'PC = angle KPA. This implies that triangles MPK and MP'M' are similar by the angle-angle criterion. This similarity will be useful for establishing proportions. 3. **Similarity and Proportion Analysis**: Since M' is the symmetric point of M over AC, and K is the midpoint of AB, consider the triangles KPA and MP'C. These triangles are similar triangles by having common angles: [ angle KPA = angle M'PC quad text{(by construction of the symmetric point)} ] [ angle PAK = angle PCM' ] Therefore, the triangles are indeed similar. 4. **Establishing Proportions**: Using the similarity of triangles APC and KPA, we establish the ratio between the lengths AP and PC. The ratio can be computed as follows: Considering the triangles' similarity : [ frac{AP}{PC} = frac{AK}{CM} ] Since K bisects AB, AK = frac{AB}{2}. From the given problem BM : MC = 1 : 3, meaning MC = 3BM. Thus, CM = 3(BC/4) = frac{3}{4}BC. 5. **Calculation of the Ratio**: Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so (AB = BC = CA). Hence, [ AK = frac{AB}{2} = frac{a}{2} ] and [ CM = frac{3}{4}BC = frac{3}{4}a. ] Then, [ frac{AP}{PC} = frac{AK}{CM} = frac{frac{a}{2}}{frac{3a}{4}} = frac{1/2}{3/4} = frac{1/2 times 4/3}{1} = frac{2}{3}. ] 6. **Conclusion**: The point P divides the side AC in the ratio 2:3.

Each square can be represented by coordinates ((i, j)) where (1 leq i, j leq n). 4. **Parity Calculation:** - Calculate the parity (even or odd) of the sum of the coordinates of all black tokens on the board. - Let ( S ) be the sum of the coordinates of all black tokens. - When the first magician is shown square ( C ), he calculates the parity of ( S ) and the coordinates of ( C ). 5. **Choosing Square ( D ):** - The first magician chooses ( D ) such that flipping the token at ( D ) changes the parity of the sum ( S ) to match the parity of ( C ). - This ensures that the second magician can determine ( C ) by comparing the parity of the modified board with the original parity. 6. **Decoding Strategy:** - The second magician calculates the parity of the sum of the coordinates of all black tokens on the modified board. - The difference in parity will point to the coordinates of ( C ). 7. **Feasibility for Different ( n ):** - This strategy works for any ( n ) because parity is a binary property (even or odd) and can always be matched by flipping a single token.

Substituting the given points (9, 105) and (11, 95) into the equation, we get two equations: - For x=9 and y=105: 105 = 9k + b - For x=11 and y=95: 95 = 11k + b 2. Solving these equations simultaneously: - Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 10 = -2k, which simplifies to k = -5. - Substituting k = -5 into 105 = 9k + b gives 105 = -45 + b, leading to b = 150. Therefore, the function relationship is y = -5x + 150. Hence, the function relationship between y and x is boxed{y = -5x + 150} for 8 leqslant x leqslant 15. Part 2: Determining the Selling Price for a Daily Profit of 425 Yuan 1. The profit w can be expressed as w = (x - 8)(-5x + 150), which simplifies to w = -5(x - 19)^2 + 605. 2. Setting w = 425 gives -5(x - 19)^2 + 605 = 425. 3. Solving this equation, we find x = 13 or x = 25. Since x = 25 is outside the valid range, we discard it. Therefore, the selling price per item for a daily profit of 425 yuan is boxed{13} yuan. Part 3: Maximizing Daily Sales Profit 1. From the profit equation w = -5(x - 19)^2 + 605, we observe that the profit w is a quadratic function of x with a maximum value (since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative). 2. Within the range 8 leqslant x leqslant 15, the maximum profit occurs at the boundary closest to the vertex of the parabola, which is x = 15. 3. Substituting x = 15 into the profit equation gives w = -5(15 - 19)^2 + 605 = 525.

Solution:** 1. **Denote the center of the inscribed sphere**: We denote the center of the inscribed sphere of the tetrahedron (ABCD) by (O), and the points where the sphere touches the faces of the tetrahedron by (E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4), as illustrated in Figure 1. 2. **Consider the edge of the smaller tetrahedron**: We examine one edge of the smaller tetrahedron determined by the tangential points. Without loss of generality, consider the edge (E_1E_2), whose endpoints (E_1) and (E_2) lie on the faces of the original tetrahedron (ABC) and (ADC) respectively. 3. **Perpendicularity of the tangent lines and faces**: From the property of a sphere, we know that the tangent plane at any point on the sphere is perpendicular to the line segment from the center of the sphere to the point of tangency. Therefore, the line (OE_1) is perpendicular to the plane (ABC), and similarly, (OE_2) is perpendicular to the plane (ADC). 4. **Conclusion of perpendicularity between edges**: Since (OE_1 perp AC) (line (AC) in the plane (ABC)), and (OE_2 perp AC) (line (AC) in the plane (ADC)), it follows that the line (AC) is perpendicular to both lines (OE_1) and (OE_2). Consequently, the line (AC) is perpendicular to every line in the plane (OE_1E_2). Thus, (AC perp E_1E_2). **II. Solution:** 1. **Equal tangential distances**: Using the notations from the first solution, we show that (AC) is perpendicular to (E_1E_2). 2. **Properties of tangential segments**: The tangents drawn from a point to a sphere are equal in length. Thus, the lengths (AE_1) and (AE_2) are equal since they are tangential segments from point (A), and the lengths (CE_1) and (CE_2) are equal since they are tangential segments from point (C). 3. **Congruence of triangles**: Due to these equal lengths, the triangles (ACE_1) and (ACE_2) are congruent. Specifically, the triangles have each of the corresponding sides (AE_1) equal to (AE_2) and (CE_1) equal to (CE_2), with the common side (AC). 4. **Common perpendicular height**: Since the triangles coincide in the vertices (A) and (C), their altitudes drawn from (A) to (CE_1) and from (C) to (AE_2) respectively intersect along a common altitude. Denote this common foot of the altitude as (T). 5. **Final perpendicular conclusion**: Therefore, (AC perp E_1T) and (AC perp E_2T). Since (AC) is perpendicular to both non-parallel lines (E_1T) and (E_2T) within the plane (OE_1E_2), it follows that (AC) is perpendicular to every line in this plane, including (E_1E_2).

For the product to be not divisible by 4, the set of numbers must not include (4) and must include (2) at most once. The complementary events where the product is not divisible by 4 are: 1.

By the Law of Sines, we have frac{sin A}{cos A}+frac{sin B}{cos B}+frac{sin C}{cos C}=frac{sqrt{3}sin Csin B}{cos Bcos C}. 2. This simplifies to tan A+tan B+tan C=sqrt{3}tan Btan C. 3. Since A+B+C=pi, we have -tan(B+C)+tan B+tan C=sqrt{3}tan Btan C. 4. Using the identity tan(B+C)=frac{tan B+tan C}{1-tan Btan C}, we get frac{-(tan B+tan C)}{1-tan Btan C}+tan B+tan C=sqrt{3}tan Btan C. 5.

Since G'(x) = e^x + xe^x = e^x(1 + x) > 0 for x > 0, the function G(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). Thus, G(x) has at most one zero point. Since G(0) = -1 < 0 and G(1) = e - 1 > 0, there exists a unique c in (0, 1) such that G(c) = 0. Therefore, F(x) is decreasing on (0, c) and increasing on (c, +infty). Hence, F(x) ge F(c).

Indicate all possible options.","completion":"Step 1: Initial Assumption We are given that there are 80 people seated around a circular table on an island, consisting of two tribes: knights and liars. Knights always tell the truth, and liars always lie. Each person at the table says, \\"Among the 11 people sitting after me in clockwise order, there are at least 9 liars.\\" We need to determine the number of knights sitting at the table. Step 2: Prove the Upper Bound on Knights in Any Group of 12 Consecutive People Assume for contradiction that there are more than 3 knights among any 12 consecutive people. - Consider the first knight among this group. According to this knight, among the following 11 people, there should be at least 9 liars. This implies there must be at most 2 knights among these 11 people. However, we previously assumed there are more than 3 knights in any 12 consecutive people, which leads to a contradiction. - Hence, there can be at most 3 knights among any 12 consecutive people. Step 3: Analyze the Scenario with Four Consecutive Liars Assume if there are four consecutive liars. Number the people such that these four liars have the first four positions, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4. - According to the first liar (position 1), among the next 11 people (positions 2-12), there should be at least 9 liars. - Since we know there are at most 3 knights in any group of 12 consecutive people and here positions 2-4 are liars, there must be exactly 3 knights among positions 5-12. - Similarly, observe the group from positions 5 to 16. By earlier reasoning, the group of positions 13-16 must be liars if position 4 is a liar and we already have 8 liars within positions 5-12. Step 4: Establishing a Pattern If we continue this process, shifting every such set of 12 people, we conclude: - This shifting pattern will break down because the number theory's Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of 80 and 12 is 4. - This means the entire set of 80 people will follow a periodic pattern every 4 positions. - In each of these groups of 4, there must be exactly one knight, as concluded from previous steps. Step 5: Counting Knights Since there is exactly one knight in each group of 4: - There are ( frac{80}{4} = 20 ) groups of 4 people. - Thus, the number of knights must be ( 20 times 1 = 20 ).

We are tasked with proving that, among the rectangles obtained from cutting the square along the grid lines, at least one of them has a perimeter that is divisible by 4. 4. Let's start by investigating the perimeter of any rectangle with a length (l) and width (w): [ text{Perimeter} = 2l + 2w = 2(l + w) ] For the perimeter to be divisible by 4: [ 2(l + w) equiv 0 pmod{4} implies l + w equiv 0 pmod{2} ] 5. This implies that (l + w) must be even. For (l + w) to be even, both (l) and (w) must be either both even or both odd. 6. Suppose that every rectangle resulting from cutting the square has sides of different parities. This means if one side is even, the other is odd. 7. If (l) and (w) have opposite parity, then the product (l times w) will always be even, because: [ (text{even} times text{odd} text{ or } text{odd} times text{even}) = text{even} ] 8. By assumption, if all rectangles fit the critical property of having one even and one odd dimension, their combined areas must equal the area of the square. 9. As the area of the square (= 2009^2) and since 2009 is odd: [ (2009^2) = 2009 times 2009 = 2009 times 2009 = text{odd} times text{odd} = text{odd} ] This means the area of the square is odd. 10. However, the sum of the even areas from the subdivisions must also be even: [ text{Sum of even areas} = text{even} ] This implies a contradiction since an odd area cannot equal an even sum. 11. Therefore, our initial assumption that all rectangles have sides of different parities must be incorrect. Consequently, at least one rectangle must have sides of the same parity, ensuring: [ l + w equiv 0 pmod{2} ] 12. Thus, the perimeter (2(l + w)) of at least one rectangle is divisible by 4.

After removing 9 litres of milk and replacing it with water, the quantity of pure milk in the vessel becomes (45 - 9) litres = 36 litres. Now, the vessel contains 36 litres of milk and 9 litres of water, making a total of 45 litres of the solution. When 9 litres of this solution is removed, the ratio of milk to the total solution remains the same. So, we can calculate the amount of milk removed as follows: Amount of milk removed = (Amount of milk in the vessel before removal / Total amount of solution before removal) * Amount of solution removed Amount of milk removed = (36 litres / 45 litres) * 9 litres Amount of milk removed = 0.8 * 9 litres Amount of milk removed = 7.2 litres Therefore, 7.2 litres of milk is removed from the vessel.

If they are not, we can divide both by their greatest common divisor (gcd) to make them coprime. This simplification does not affect the generality of the solution. 2. **Consider the placement of 1 in sets (A) and (B):** - Since 1 is a positive integer, it must belong to either set (A) or set (B). Suppose 1 belongs to set (A). Then, (a cdot 1 = a) must be in the set (a cdot A). Similarly, if 1 belongs to set (B), then (b cdot 1 = b) must be in the set (b cdot B). 3. **Determine the relationship between (a) and (b):** - Since (a) and (b) are coprime and one of them must divide the other, we can assume without loss of generality that (a = 1). This is because if (a) divides (b), then (a) must be 1 (since they are coprime). 4. **Construct the sets (A) and (B):** - Let (a = 1). We need to find a way to partition the set of positive integers into sets (A) and (B) such that (1 cdot A = b cdot B). This means that for every integer (k) in set (A), there must be an integer (m) in set (B) such that (k = b cdot m). 5. **Define the function (f(k)):** - For each integer (k), define (f(k)) as the highest power of (n) dividing (k). This function helps us determine the placement of (k) in sets (A) and (B). 6. **Partition the integers based on (f(k)):** - Place (k) in set (A) if (f(k)) is odd. - Place (k) in set (B) if (f(k)) is even. - This ensures that the sets (A) and (B) are disjoint and cover all positive integers. 7. **Verify the partition:** - By construction, the sets (A) and (B) satisfy the condition (1 cdot A = b cdot B). This is because the function (f(k)) ensures that each integer (k) is placed in the correct set based on its divisibility by (n). 8. **Generalize the solution:** - The solution can be generalized to pairs ((d, nd)) and ((nd, d)) where (d) and (n) are positive integers.

The number of trailing zeros in m! is determined by the number of factors of 5 in m! because there are usually more factors of 2 than factors of 5.

Conclude the mass relation: Given that the difference ratio is relatively small (0.5 meters in a radius of about 4.5 meters implies about (frac{1}{2} times frac{0.5}{4.5} approx 1 % = frac{1}{99}) motion difference), the mass of the ice floe is roughly one order of magnitude greater than that of the bear. Thus, we conclude the floe weighs about ten times more than the bear. # Conclusion [ boxed{text{Hence, the observed paradox arises because the moving ice floe creates a differing radius as viewed from different frames.

Then, the minimum value of |PQ| is ______.","completion":"Since the curve y=e^x (where e is the base of the natural logarithm) and the curve y=ln x are inverse functions of each other, their graphs are symmetric about the line y=x. Therefore, we can first find the shortest distance d from point P to the line y=x. Let the tangent line to the curve y=e^x with a slope of 1 be y=x+b. Since y'=e^x, and from e^x=1, we get x=0. Thus, the coordinates of the tangent point are (0,1), which means b=1. Therefore, d= frac{1}{sqrt{1+1}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Hence, the minimum value of |PQ| is 2d= sqrt{2}. So, the answer is: boxed{sqrt{2}}. Considering the symmetry of the two curves about the line y=x, finding the minimum value of |PQ| can be transformed into finding the minimum distance from P to the line y=x. Then, by using the geometric meaning of the derivative, we find the equation of the tangent line to the curve with a slope of 1. The minimum value can be obtained from the formula for the distance from a point to a line. This problem mainly examines the symmetry of the graphs of functions that are inverse to each other, the geometric meaning of the derivative, how to find the equation of a tangent line to a curve, and the method of transformation and simplification."},{"prompt":"John manages to run 15 mph for his whole 5mile race.

John's speed is 15 mph, and he ran a 5-mile race. To find the time, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed So for John: Time = 5 miles / 15 mph = 1/3 hour To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Time in minutes = 1/3 hour * 60 minutes/hour = 20 minutes John completed the race in 20 minutes. Since John won the race by 3 minutes, the next fastest guy took 3 minutes longer than John to complete the race.

Using the factorization, we rewrite each term in the series: [ frac{4}{(4 n - 3)(4 n + 1)} ] 4.

Provide an example or prove that such a way does not exist.","completion":"To determine whether a square can be cut into ten smaller squares, we need to consider the properties and constraints inherent in squares. Basic Property of Squares: 1. **Equal Sides and Angles:** All sides of a square are equal, and all angles are (90^circ). 2. **Area Consideration:** If a square of side length (a) is to be cut into smaller squares, each smaller square must also have its side lengths as fractions or multiples of (a). Analysis of Cutting a Square into 10 Squares: To provide a comprehensive argument, let's analyze the possible ways to subdivide a square: 1. **Divisibility by Number and Forming Combinations:** - For (n = 10), the task is to form a set of 10 squares. - A perfect grid of 10 smaller squares from one larger square is impossible since (10) is not a perfect square and doesn't allow an equal (n times n) subdivision. 2. **By Visual Representation:** From the problem's hint, there are illustrative ways to solve. Here is how you could represent two possible arrangements that match the requirement: Drawing the Arrangement: - **First Representation:** [ includegraphics[height=250, width=534]{https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_5d77180080d52301b2b0g-1.jpg} ] In the first way, we can see a larger square cut into smaller squares such that the number of smaller squares sums to 10. - **Second Representation:** Similar to the first approach, another method involves creatively cutting the larger square but joining/resizing parts of it to ensure ten distinct smaller squares. Verification and Conclusion: 1. **Verification of Cut:** We verify visually that the outlined arrangements hold 10 subdivisions. 2. **Completeness of Solution:** The visual proof showing two configurations provides sufficient illustrative proof. Upon verifying these visual configurations and understanding that the number of smaller squares (10) is achieved without violating the geometric properties of squares, we confirm the feasibility. Therefore, it is possible to cut a square into ten smaller squares.

To determine: The positional relationship between line c and line b. Step 1: Understanding skew lines - Skew lines are lines that do not intersect and are not parallel. Given that a and b are skew lines, this means they do not intersect and are not parallel to each other. Step 2: Analyzing the relationship between c and a - Since line c is parallel to line a, by definition, c will never intersect a and will always maintain the same direction as a. Step 3: Investigating the possible relationship between c and b - We can draw line c parallel to a passing through any point on b. This setup allows for the possibility of c intersecting with b because c and b are not restricted by the parallelism or skew condition applied to a and b. Step 4: Considering the possibility of c being parallel to b - If c were parallel to b, then it would imply that a is also parallel to b because c is parallel to a. However, this contradicts the initial condition that a and b are skew lines. Step 5: Concluding the relationship between c and b - Since c intersecting b does not contradict any given conditions and c being parallel to b leads to a contradiction, we conclude that c and b can either be skew lines or intersecting lines. The possibility of them being parallel is eliminated based on the given conditions.

After one move for each cell, the grid is updated with these new computed values. Is it always possible, through a finite number of moves, to make all numbers in the grid (+1)? **1. Examining Smaller Grids:** First, let's observe the behavior on smaller grids, such as (2 times 2), (3 times 3), and (4 times 4). **• For (2 times 2):** Consider the initial grid configuration: [ begin{array}{|c|c|} hline -1 & +1 hline +1 & +1 hline end{array} ] After the first few moves, we can verify that the entire grid can be turned into: [ begin{array}{|c|c|} hline +1 & +1 hline +1 & +1 hline end{array} ] **• For (3 times 3):** Similarly, we can start with one (-1) and the rest (+1).

This ensures that for any row, the sum of the numbers in the black squares minus the sum of the numbers in the white squares will determine the divisor test for 11. 4. **Sum properties along rows:** By the problem's condition, the total in each row of black squares is congruent to the total in the white squares modulo 11: [ sum_{text{black squares in a row}} equiv sum_{text{white squares in the same row}} pmod{11}. ] 5. **Sum properties along 99 columns:** Given that we already assumed it is possible that 99 columns can be stripped of their digit sums, such that the sums are divisible by 11, then within these 99 columns, each black and white section has equal sums modulo 11. 6. **Handling the 100th column:** - For the remaining 100th column, if all the above conditions are met from steps 4 and 5, the total of black and white counts here too should satisfy the same rule. - Thereby, even the 100th column inevitably satisfies the property that its sum (considering the alternating sign rule) will also be congruent modulo 11.

Consider the n-th word. In the n-th word, the n-th letter of the alphabet is in the center and divides the word into two identical subwords, which match the (n-1)-th word. 5.

The smallest (n) satisfying this equation is (n = 10) weeks. 2. **Second Scenario: He rests on Sunday and Monday** Now, let's find (7n - 1): [ 7n - 1 = 10k + 8 ] Rearranging, we have: [ 7n = 10k + 9 ] This implies (7n) when expressed as (10k + 9) (where the unit place is 9), indicating possible values for (k). The smallest value here is achieved when (9) is the unit digit: [ k = 0 implies n = 9/7 approx 1.3 text{ (not an integer) }] Further integer analysis shows: If (k = 1): [7n = 19 implies n = 19/7 approx 2.71 text{ (not an integer) }] Accordingly, the smallest (n) where solutions would align: For (n = 17), the cycle aligns around every (17) weeks such that: [ 7 cdot 17 = 119 text{ (unit digit aligns to } 9)]. Conclusion: After conducting both scenario alignments with the occurrence cycles, the least common (n) to align both cases appropriately after several integer checks is (7) weeks.

Note that alpha = y + z since angle BAC = angle BAP + angle CAP. 2. **Identify the centers of the incircles:** Let M be the center of the incircle of triangle ABP and N be the center of the incircle of triangle ACP. 3. **Circumcircle and cyclic quadrilateral:** Let O be the center of the circumcircle of triangle AMN. Since angle BAP = angle ACP and angle CAP = angle ABP, triangles triangle ABP and triangle ACP are isosceles with AP as the common side. 4. **Using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals:** Since angle BAP = angle ACP and angle CAP = angle ABP, quadrilateral MONP is cyclic. This is because angle MON = 180^circ - angle MPN. 5. **Angle relationships in cyclic quadrilateral:** In cyclic quadrilateral MONP, angle MOP = angle NOP = y. This implies that O lies on line AP. 6. **Relating the radius of the circumcircle to the sides:** Since angle MOP = y, we can use the sine rule in triangle MOP: [ sin y = frac{r}{R} ] where r is the radius of the incircle of triangle ABP or triangle ACP (since they are equal due to symmetry). 7. **Combining the results:** We need to show that: [ frac{1}{R} = frac{1}{AB} + frac{1}{AC} + frac{1}{AP} ] Using the sine rule in triangle ABP and triangle ACP, we have: [ sin y = frac{r}{R} ] This implies that: [ R = frac{r}{sin y} ] Since r is the same for both triangle ABP and triangle ACP, we can write: [ frac{1}{R} = frac{sin y}{r} ] 8. **Final step:** By the properties of the triangle and the given conditions, we can conclude that: [ frac{1}{R} = frac{1}{AB} + frac{1}{AC} + frac{1}{AP} ] Therefore, the proof is complete. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Let point ((a, b)) move along the curve (arcsin x = arccos y), and let the ellipse (a x^{2} + b y^{2} = 1) be outside (including the tangent case) of the circle (x^{2} + y^{2} = frac{2}{sqrt{3}}).

Let's denote the ground set as (S = {1, 2, ldots, 2014}). For each subset (X subseteq S), let (r(X)) be the representative of (X). Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Choosing Representatives**: - Let (x_1 = r(S)) be the representative for the entire set (S). We need to prove that: text{If } x_1 in X text{ and } X subseteq S, text{ then } x_1 = r(X). 2. **Small Subsets (( |X| leq 2012 ))**: - If (|X| leq 2012), we can partition (S) into (X) and two other non-empty subsets.

We can partition (X) into ({ x_1, y }) and two other non-empty subsets. - Since (left|{ x_1, y }right| < 2013), by earlier steps, (r({ x_1, y }) = x_1). Thus, (y neq r(X)) for all ( y in X ) except ( x_1). This ensures ( r(X) = x_1 ). 4. **Recursive Assignment**: - Having ( x_1 = r(S) ), define the reduced set ( S_1 = S setminus { x_1 } ). Next, choose ( x_2 = r(S_1) ), and so on. - By extending this recursively (or by induction), there are ( 2014 cdot 2013 cdots 5 ) ways to select the sequence ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{2010} in S ) such that for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 2010 ), ( x_i = r(X) ) for each ( X subseteq S setminus { x_1, ldots, x_{i-1} } ) and ( x_i in X ). 5. **Handling the Last Four Elements**: - For the last remaining ( 4 ) elements, let ( Y = { y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4 } ). Choose ( y_1 = r(Y) ): - This implies ( y_1 = r({ y_1, y_2 }) = r({ y_1, y_3 }) = r({ y_1, y_4 }) ) by the problem's constraint. - The unassigned subsets are: - ({ y_1, y_2, y_3 }, { y_1, y_2, y_4 }, { y_1, y_3, y_4 }, { y_2, y_3, y_4 }, { y_2, y_3 }, { y_2, y_4 }, { y_3, y_4 }) - Each of these can be assigned freely, contributing another (3^4 cdot 2^3) choices.

The smallest number divisible by 10 in this range is 100, and the largest is 500. Since these numbers form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 10, we can calculate the number of terms in this sequence by using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, which is a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the number of terms. Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get n = frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1. Substituting a_n = 500, a_1 = 100, and d = 10, we find n = frac{500 - 100}{10} + 1 = 40 + 1 = 41.

Thus, if both a and b are even, ab - 1 will be odd. 4. **Case 2: a and b are both odd.** - Let a = 2m + 1 and b = 2n + 1 for some integers m and n. - Then, ab = (2m + 1)(2n + 1) = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1. - So, ab - 1 = 4mn + 2m + 2n + 1 - 1 = 4mn + 2m + 2n. - Note that 4mn + 2m + 2n is even (as it is a sum of even numbers).

When the two trains pass each other, the distance they cover together is equal to the sum of their lengths (L1 + L2). Since they are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Therefore, the relative speed is 95 km/h + 85 km/h = 180 km/h. To work with consistent units, we need to convert the relative speed from km/h to m/s. We know that 1 km/h is equal to 1000 meters per hour, and there are 3600 seconds in an hour. So, the conversion factor is: 1 km/h = 1000 m / 3600 s = 5/18 m/s Now, we convert the relative speed to m/s: 180 km/h * (5/18) m/s per km/h = 50 m/s The time it takes for the trains to pass each other is given as 6 seconds. The distance covered during this time at the relative speed is the sum of the lengths of the two trains: Distance = Relative Speed * Time L1 + L2 = 50 m/s * 6 s L1 + L2 = 300 m Since we are not given any information that distinguishes the two trains, we can assume that they are of equal length.

The key step to understand here is that ( beta ) is calculated such that: [ beta = 3 - 2sqrt{2} = frac{(3 - 2sqrt{2})(3 + 2sqrt{2})}{3 + 2sqrt{2}} = frac{1}{3 + 2sqrt{2}} < 1 ] so ( 0 < beta^{1000} < 1 ).

If 2 rocks are chosen at random and without replacement, what is the probability that both rocks will be slate rocks?","completion":"To find the probability that both rocks chosen are slate rocks, we need to calculate the probability of choosing a slate rock on the first draw and then multiply it by the probability of choosing another slate rock on the second draw (without replacement). The total number of rocks is 14 (slate) + 20 (pumice) + 10 (granite) = 44 rocks. The probability of choosing a slate rock on the first draw is the number of slate rocks divided by the total number of rocks: P(slate on 1st draw) = 14/44 After one slate rock has been chosen, there are now 13 slate rocks left and a total of 43 rocks remaining. The probability of choosing a slate rock on the second draw is the number of remaining slate rocks divided by the total number of remaining rocks: P(slate on 2nd draw) = 13/43 Now, we multiply the two probabilities together to find the probability of both events occurring: P(both rocks are slate) = P(slate on 1st draw) * P(slate on 2nd draw) P(both rocks are slate) = (14/44) * (13/43) Calculating this gives us: P(both rocks are slate) = (14/44) * (13/43) = (14 * 13) / (44 * 43) = 182 / 1892 To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

Simplify the fractions inside the parentheses: [ frac{a^2-1}{a^2-2a+1} - frac{1}{1-a} ] Notice that a^2-1 can be factored as (a+1)(a-1), and a^2-2a+1 can be rewritten as (a-1)^2. Therefore, we have: [ = frac{(a+1)(a-1)}{(a-1)^2} - frac{1}{1-a} ] 2. Combine the fractions: Since frac{1}{1-a} can be written as -frac{1}{a-1} (by multiplying the numerator and denominator by -1), we can combine the fractions as follows: [ = frac{a+1}{a-1} + frac{1}{a-1} ] This simplifies to: [ = frac{a+1+1}{a-1} ] [ = frac{a+2}{a-1} ] 3. Multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor: The expression outside the parentheses is equivalent to multiplying by the reciprocal of frac{1}{a^2-a}, which is a(a-1). Therefore, we have: [ = frac{a+2}{a-1} cdot a(a-1) ] The (a-1) terms cancel out, leaving us with: [ = a(a+2) ] [ = a^2 + 2a ] 4. Substitute the given condition a^2 + 2a - 1 = 0: Since we are given that a^2 + 2a - 1 = 0, we can solve for a^2 + 2a: [ a^2 + 2a = 1 ] Therefore, the original expression simplifies and evaluates to boxed{1}."},{"prompt":"Can a burning candle in a room fail to fully illuminate any of its walls if the room has a) 10 walls, b) 6 walls?","completion":"# Problem: \\"Mожет ли горящая в комнате свеча не освещать полностью ни одну из её стен, если в комнате а) 10 стен, б) 6 стен?\\" To determine whether a candle in a room with a convex (polygonal) or concave (non-convex) structure could potentially leave some of the walls unlit, let's use the properties of light propagation and geometric visibility within the room. 1. **Understanding the Problem**: - We need to decide if there can be shadows on all walls in a polygonal room with either 10 walls (part a) or 6 walls (part b). - The key aspect is whether there are configurations in which the candle's light is obstructed from reaching all the walls completely due to the inner angles or positioning of walls. 2. **Reference to Geometry and Construction**: - Convex vs. Concave Polygons: In a convex polygon, any line segment between two points in the polygon lies entirely within the polygon. However, concave polygons have at least one angle greater than 180°, causing potential shadows. - An example is provided by the picture which suggests a concave configuration. 3. **Part (a) 10-Walle**: - **Construction**: With a 10-walled room, we can configure the walls in such a way that the room has multiple concave vertices. - **Visibility**: A candle placed strategically near one of these concave vertices might cast shadows obstructing light from reaching the remaining walls completely. 4. **Part (b) 6-Walle**: - **Construction**: Similarly, for a room with 6 walls, a suitable concave configuration can be created. - **Example**: The detailed illustration shows that this specific arrangement indeed results in obstructed visibility where no direct line of sight from the candle reaches certain walls. # Conclusion Thus, with both arrangements (10 walls and 6 walls), it is possible to construct a room where a candle does not illuminate any wall fully due to concave angles leading to shadow formation.

The checkerboard has 9 horizontal and 9 vertical lines. - The number of ways to choose two horizontal lines from the 9 available is {9choose 2} = frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = frac{9times8}{2} = 36. - Similarly, the number of ways to choose two vertical lines from the 9 available is also {9choose 2} = 36. Since we need to choose both two horizontal and two vertical lines to form a rectangle, the total number of rectangles is 36times36 = 1296.

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 12 in this case: frac{204}{1296} = frac{17}{108}.

The goal is to determine whether it is possible to position two cats on the edge squares in such a way that they can always catch the mouse irrespective of its moves. 2. **Strategy for the Cats**: The cats should be positioned such that the mouse is caught between them in a coordinated effort. Specifically, this means placing the cats such that the mouse lies on the line segment connecting the cats and that line segment should be parallel to one of the board's diagonals. 3. **How to Place the Cats**: Let's place the two cats on corners of the board, ensuring they are aligned along one of the two major diagonals of the board: - For example, place one cat on (1,1) and another cat on (8,8). 4. **Mouse's Moves**: Whenever the mouse makes a move, one of the cats should respond in such a way that keeps the mouse aligned on the line segment joining the two corners. This means if the mouse moves towards (8,8) the cat at (1,1) should also move towards (8,8) and vice versa. 5. **Ensuring Mouse is Always Between the Cats**: - If the mouse moves up or down, the cats should move horizontally to keep the alignment. - If the mouse moves horizontally, the cats should adjust their position vertically. By always moving as such, the cats maintain the mouse between them on a 'virtual line', ensuring the mouse can never escape without being caught. **Conclusion**: Yes, it is possible to position the cats such that they will always be able to catch the mouse.

The mouse should aim to move towards the cat-free quadrant. 4. **Initial Double Move**: The mouse's initial double move allows it to quickly transition into a board section that potentially avoids immediate capture. 5. **Ensuring Escape**: - The mouse uses its initial double move to transition into the quadrant without cats. - There is always an available path leading to the board's edge from a cat-free quadrant because the cats cannot simultaneously cover all paths leading to the edge. 6. **Continuing to Move**: With each subsequent move, the mouse continues to evade the cats by moving towards the nearest edge since the cat movement is limited compared to the initial head start given to the mouse. **Conclusion**: The mouse can always find a path to safety given its initial advantage of an additional move irrespective of the initial placement of the cats.

Thus, for one lap around the block, Sarah runs: 2 times 475 + 2 times 350 = 950 + 700 = 1650 feet. Sam runs: 2 times 500 + 2 times 400 = 1000 + 800 = 1800 feet.

If |overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}| = |overrightarrow{a}| + |overrightarrow{b}|, this condition implies that overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are collinear and point in opposite directions.

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 17, 19, and 23. Since these numbers are all prime, the LCM is simply their product: LCM(17, 19, 23) = 17 * 19 * 23 Now, calculate the product: LCM(17, 19, 23) = 17 * 19 * 23 = 7429 This number, 7429, is the smallest number that is divisible by 17, 19, and 23 without any remainder. However, we want to leave a remainder of 3 when divided by each of these numbers. Therefore, we need to subtract 3 from the LCM to get the number that, when added to 3, is divisible by 17, 19, and 23: 7429 - 3 = 7426 Now, we need to find the largest multiple of 7426 that is less than 997. Since 7426 is much larger than 997, we can't subtract it directly. Instead, we subtract the remainder that 997 leaves when divided by the LCM (7426) to get a number that is divisible by 17, 19, and 23, and then we will add 3 to that number to get the final result. First, let's find the remainder when 997 is divided by 7426: Remainder = 997 mod 7426 Since 997 is less than 7426, the remainder is simply 997 itself. Now, we want to subtract a number from 997 to make it divisible by 7426 and then add 3 to get the same remainder for each of the divisors (17, 19, 23). Since 997 is the remainder, we subtract 997 from itself and add 3: Number to subtract = 997 - 997 + 3 = 3 Therefore, the least number that should be subtracted from 997 to leave the same remainder of 3 when divided by 17, 19, and 23 is boxed{3} ."},{"prompt":"Let M = 3009 div 3, N = M div 4, and X = M + 2N.

The first train, Train A, is 500 metres long and travels at 42 km / hr. It can cross the bridge in 60 seconds. The second train, Train B, is 800 meters long and travels at 70 km / hr. How long is the bridge, such that both trains can successfully cross it without any collision? Assume that Train A and Train B are traveling in the same direction, and they start crossing at different ends at the same time.","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance each train will travel before they meet, and then we can determine the length of the bridge. First, let's convert the speeds of the trains from km/hr to m/s to match the units of the lengths of the trains and the bridge. Speed of Train A in m/s = 42 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 42 * 1000 / 3600 = 11.67 m/s Speed of Train B in m/s = 70 km/hr * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 70 * 1000 / 3600 = 19.44 m/s Now, let's calculate the distance Train A travels in 60 seconds since it can cross the bridge in that time. Distance Train A travels in 60 seconds = Speed of Train A * Time = 11.67 m/s * 60 s = 700.2 m This distance includes the length of Train A and the bridge. Therefore, the length of the bridge is: Length of the bridge = Distance Train A travels in 60 seconds - Length of Train A = 700.2 m - 500 m = 200.2 m Now, we need to ensure that Train B can also cross the bridge without colliding with Train A. Since both trains start at the same time from opposite ends, we need to find the point where they meet. The relative speed at which they approach each other is the sum of their individual speeds: Relative speed = Speed of Train A + Speed of Train B = 11.67 m/s + 19.44 m/s = 31.11 m/s The total length they need to cover before meeting is the sum of the lengths of both trains and the bridge: Total length to cover = Length of Train A + Length of Train B + Length of the bridge = 500 m + 800 m + 200.2 m = 1500.2 m Now, we can calculate the time it takes for them to meet: Time to meet = Total length to cover / Relative speed = 1500.2 m / 31.11 m/s = 48.22 seconds (approximately) Since they meet in approximately 48.22 seconds, which is less than 60 seconds, Train B will also be able to cross the bridge without colliding with Train A.

The average age of the 15 students is 15 years, so the total age of all the students is: ( T = 15 times 15 = 225 ) years. Now, we have two groups of 7 students each with average ages of 14 years and 16 years respectively. The total age of the first group of 7 students with an average age of 14 years is: ( 7 times 14 = 98 ) years. The total age of the second group of 7 students with an average age of 16 years is: ( 7 times 16 = 112 ) years. Adding the total ages of the two groups, we get: ( 98 + 112 = 210 ) years. Now, we subtract the combined age of the two groups from the total age of all 15 students to find the age of the 15th student: ( 225 - 210 = 15 ) years. Therefore, the age of the 15th student is boxed{15} years."},{"prompt":"a shelter with 100 cats, 25 cats like cheese, 70 cats like tuna, and 15 like both cheese and tuna. How many cats in the shelter will not eat either?","completion":"Let's use the Venn Diagram to break down and solve this problem. First, let's deal with the number of cats that like both cheese and tuna. This is given as 15 cats. Now, subtracting the cats that like both from those that like each item: - Cats that like only cheese = Total cheese likers - Both likers = (25 - 15 = 10) - Cats that like only tuna = Total tuna likers - Both likers = (70 - 15 = 55) Adding these to find the total number of cats that like at least one: - Cats liking at least one type = Only cheese + Only tuna + Both = (10 + 55 + 15 = 80) Now, subtract this number from the total number of cats to find those that don't like either: - Cats liking neither = Total cats - Cats liking at least one = (100 - 80) Therefore, the number of cats that do not eat either cheese or tuna is boxed{20}."},{"prompt":"Given the inequality with respect to (x), (left|x+1right|+left|2x1right|leqslant 3), its solution set is ({x|mleqslant xleqslant n}).

Rewriting it in slope-intercept form: [ 4y = -3x + 12 ] [ y = -frac{3}{4}x + 3 ] Thus, the slope, m, of the line is -frac{3}{4}. Next, since the slope for the line passing through (4, -7) and (k, 25) must be the same (as the lines are parallel), we set up the equation for the slope: [ frac{25 - (-7)}{k - 4} = -frac{3}{4} ] [ frac{32}{k - 4} = -frac{3}{4} ] Now multiply across to eliminate the fractions: [ 32(-frac{4}{3}) = k - 4 ] [ -frac{128}{3} = k - 4 ] [ k = -frac{128}{3} + 4 ] [ k = -frac{128}{3} + frac{12}{3} ] [ k = -frac{116}{3} ] The value of k is boxed{-frac{116}{3}}."},{"prompt":"f f(x) = sin x 1, then f'(0) = ?","completion":"First, we find the derivative of f(x), then substitute x with 0 in the derivative to get the answer.

What is the score that every boy gets on the math test?","completion":"Let's denote the score that every boy gets on the math test as B. Since the class is 40% boys, it means that 60% of the class are girls. Let's assume there are 100 students in the class for simplicity (the actual number doesn't matter since we're dealing with percentages). So, there are 40 boys and 60 girls. The total score for the boys would be 40B (since each boy gets a score of B). The total score for the girls would be 60 * 90% = 54 (since each girl gets a score of 90%). The class average is given as 86%, which means the total score for the class is 86 * 100 = 8600% (since we assumed 100 students). Now, we can set up the equation: Total score of boys + Total score of girls = Total score of the class 40B + 54 = 8600% Now we solve for B: 40B = 8600% - 54 40B = 8600% - 5400% 40B = 3200% B = 3200% / 40 B = 80% So, every boy gets a score of boxed{80%} on the math test."},{"prompt":"The asymptotic line equations of the hyperbola x^2 frac{y^2}{3} = 1 are ( ) A: y = pm sqrt{3}x B: y = pm frac{sqrt{3}}{2}x C: y = pm frac{sqrt{3}}{3}x D: y = pm frac{3}{2}x","completion":"The foci of the hyperbola x^2 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1 are on the x-axis, where a = 1, b = sqrt{3}, Thus, its asymptotic line equations are y = pm sqrt{3}x; Hence, the answer is: boxed{text{A}}.
