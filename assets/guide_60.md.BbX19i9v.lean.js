Thus, (-2018) is also a root of (P(X)). 2. **Factorization and substitution:** Given (P(0) = 0) and (P(-2018) = 0), we know that (X) and ((X + 2018)) are factors of (P(X)). Therefore, we can write: [ P(X) = X (X + 2018) Q(X), ] for some polynomial (Q(X)). 3. **Substitute into original equation:** Substitute (P(X) = X(X+2018)Q(X)) into the original equation, so it becomes: [ (X + 2019) X (X + 2018) Q(X) = X (X + 1)(X + 2018 + 1) Q(X + 1). ] Simplify the equation: [ (X + 2019) X (X + 2018) Q(X) = X (X + 1)(X + 2019) Q(X + 1). ] Since (X neq 0) and (X + 2019 neq 0), we can divide both sides by (X(X + 2019)): [ (X + 2018) Q(X) = (X + 1) Q(X + 1). ] 4. **Recursive property:** Consider: [ (X + 2018) Q(X) = (X + 1) Q(X + 1). ] Evaluate at (X = 0): [ 2018Q(0) = Q(1). ] Evaluate at (X = 1): [ 2017Q(1) = 2Q(2). ] Notice the pattern here.

We need to show that ( n ) lines can be chosen to cover all ( n^2 ) points of the grid. 1. Let ( A ) and ( B ) be finite sets such that ( |A| = a ) and ( |B| = b ) with ( a leq b ). 2. The grid ( C = A times B ) has ( a times b ) points. 3. Suppose ( a + b - 3 ) lines cover ( C ). We need to show that ( n ) lines can be chosen to cover all points of the grid. We proceed by contradiction: 4. Assume that ( C' ) is the set of points obtained from ( C ) by omitting all points lying on the perpendicular lines. 5. Let ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) be the number of lines perpendicular to the basis vectors of ( mathbb{R} ). Then ( C' ) has ((a - k_1)(b - k_2)) points. 6. If ( C' = emptyset ), then ( a = k_1 ) or ( b = k_2 ), and a coverage of ( C' ) can be chosen. 7. Suppose ( C' neq emptyset ). Then ( C' ) is covered by ( a + b - 3 - k_1 - k_2 ) lines not left out of the original coverage. 8. If ( a - k_1 = 1 ), then the point ( b - k_2 ) in ( C' ) is on a section parallel to the vectors, so to cover them, you need a line ( b - k_2 ). However, ( b - k_2 > b - k_2 - 2 = a + b - 3 - k_1 - k_2 ), which is a contradiction. 9. The same holds if ( b - k_2 = 1 ). 10. Suppose ( a - k_1 geq 2 ) and ( b - k_2 geq 2 ). Then the convex hull of ( C' ) is a rectangle with boundary ( 2(a - k_1) + 2(b - k_2) - 4 ) points. 11. Any non-axial line can contain at most two points on the boundary of the rectangle, so the line ( a + b - 3 - k_1 - k_2 ) has at most ( 2(a + b - 3 - k_1 - k_2) < 2(a - k_1) + 2(b - k_2) - 4 ) points on the boundary of the rectangle, which means it cannot cover ( C' ), leading to a contradiction. Thus, the case ( d = 2 ) is proven. # Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for ( d-1 ) Assume that for a ( (d-1) )-dimensional grid, ( n ) hyperplanes can be chosen to cover all points of the grid. 1. Consider a ( d )-dimensional grid. If for some ( i ) where ( 1 leq i leq n ), we have ( V_i = {x_1 = i} subset mathbb{R} ) is not between the intercepting hyperplanes, then we can apply the induction hypothesis to the intersection of the lattice ( mathbb{R}_i ) with ( V_i ). 2. There are ( L_1^{(i)}, L_2^{(i)}, ldots, L_n^{(i)} ) hyperplanes such that the ( L_k^{(i)} cap V_i ) ( (d-2) )-dimensional planes are perpendicular to the ( x_2 )-axis and together cover ( mathbb{R}_i ). 3. If ( V_j ) (( j neq i )) is also not between the overlapping hyperplanes, then the ( (d-2) )-dimensional planes ( L_1^{(j)} cap V_j, L_2^{(j)} cap V_j, ldots, L_n^{(i)} ) defined for ( V_j ) are also perpendicular to the ( x_2 )-axis. 4. Otherwise, ( L_1^{(i)}, L_2^{(i)}, ldots, L_n^{(i)}, L_1^{(j)}, L_2^{(j)}, ldots, L_n^{(j)} ) would be ( 2n ) different hyperplanes, which is impossible as ( 2n > 2n - 3 ). Suppose ( L_k^{(i)} = L_s^{(j)} ): 5. Then ( L_k^{(i)} cap V_i ) is parallel to ( L_s^{(j)} cap V_j ), since ( V_i ) is parallel to ( V_j ), so ( L_s^{(j)} cap V_j ) is perpendicular to the ( x_2 )-axis. 6. If ( L_s^{(j)} cap V_j ) is also perpendicular to an axis other than the ( x_2 )-axis, then the ( (d-2) )-dimensional plane ( L_s^{(j)} cap V_j ) has a planar dimension of at least 2 for the ( (d-1) )-dimensional plane ( V_j ), which is impossible. Now notice: 7. If ( L_k^{(i)} cap V_i ) is perpendicular to the ( x_2 )-axis, then the hyperplane ( L_k^{(i)} ) is perpendicular to the plane ([x_1, x_2]). 8. Indeed, the 2-codimensional plane ( L_k^{(i)} cap V_i ) in ( mathbb{R} ) is perpendicular to the ( x_1 )-axis, the ( x_2 )-axis, and the normal vector ( n_i ) of the plane ( L_k^{(i)} ), so ( n_i ) must be parallel to the plane ([x_1, x_2]). Thus, if we consider only the intercept hyperplanes perpendicular to the plane ([x_1, x_2]), then they already cover the grid. Therefore, the projection of everything on the plane ([x_1, x_2]) reduces the problem to the case for ( d = 2 ). # Conclusion For ( d geq 2 ), the cube grid can be covered with ( n ) hyperplanes so that none of the ( 2n - 2 ) overlapping hyperplanes can be omitted.

D: A directional vector of line l is overrightarrow{v}=({sqrt{3}，3}).","completion":"To solve this problem, let's analyze each option step by step based on the given line l: sqrt{3}x+y-2=0. First, we rewrite the equation of line l in slope-intercept form, which is y=mx+b where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Starting from sqrt{3}x+y-2=0, we get: [ y = -sqrt{3}x + 2 ] This means the slope of the line, m, is -sqrt{3}. **Option A**: The slope of line l is given as frac{5pi}{6}. This option is discussing the angle of inclination, not the slope in the algebraic sense. The slope we found is -sqrt{3}, which corresponds to an angle of inclination of frac{2pi}{3}, not frac{5pi}{6}. Therefore, option A is incorrect. **Option B**: States that the slope of line l is sqrt{3}. This contradicts our calculation, which shows the slope is -sqrt{3}.

The normal vector is perpendicular to the line, and its direction is determined by the coefficients of x and y in the line's equation. Since the line's equation is sqrt{3}x+y-2=0, a normal vector to the line would indeed be overrightarrow{u}=(sqrt{3}, 1), not (1, sqrt{3}) as given. However, the dot product of overrightarrow{u} and a vector parallel to the line would not be zero, indicating that overrightarrow{u} as given is not correctly representing a normal vector.

The time required for the minivan to cover the distance of (frac{20}{3} text{ km}) is: [ text{Time} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Speed}} = frac{frac{20}{3} text{ km}}{50 text{ km/h}} = frac{20}{3} div 50 = frac{20}{3} times frac{1}{50} = frac{20}{150} = frac{2}{15} text{ hours} ] 4. **Convert Time to Minutes**: Convert (frac{2}{15} text{ hours}) back to minutes: [ frac{2}{15} text{ hours} times 60 text{ minutes/hour} = frac{2 times 60}{15} = frac{120}{15} = 8 text{ minutes} ] 5. **Determine the Time Difference Between Arrivals**: The minivan arrives 10 minutes before the car.

When 2 type Q machines and 3 type B machines work together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: [ 2 times frac{1}{5} + 3 times frac{1}{B} = frac{2}{5} + frac{3}{B} ] This combined group of machines completes the job in 1.2 hours, so their combined rate is ( frac{1}{1.2} ) of the job per hour. Setting the combined rate equal to the rate at which the job is completed, we get: [ frac{2}{5} + frac{3}{B} = frac{1}{1.2} ] To solve for ( B ), we first simplify ( frac{1}{1.2} ): [ frac{1}{1.2} = frac{1}{frac{6}{5}} = frac{5}{6} ] Now we have: [ frac{2}{5} + frac{3}{B} = frac{5}{6} ] To solve for ( B ), we subtract ( frac{2}{5} ) from both sides: [ frac{3}{B} = frac{5}{6} - frac{2}{5} ] To subtract the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is ( 30 ): [ frac{3}{B} = frac{5 times 5}{6 times 5} - frac{2 times 6}{5 times 6} ] [ frac{3}{B} = frac{25}{30} - frac{12}{30} ] [ frac{3}{B} = frac{13}{30} ] Now we solve for ( B ) by cross-multiplying: [ 3 times 30 = 13 times B ] [ 90 = 13B ] [ B = frac{90}{13} ] [ B approx 6.923 ] So, it will take approximately boxed{6.923} hours for a type B machine to complete the job alone."},{"prompt":"One endpoint of the major axis and one of the minor axis of an ellipse is A and B, respectively, and one of its foci closer to A is F.

Therefore, we need to find the point (M) on the arc (AB) for which the perpendicular distance to the line (BF) is greatest. 3. **Equation of Line (BF):** Let (e) be the tangent line to the ellipse at some point that is parallel to (BF). This tangent line will give us the maximum distance: 4. **Finding the Point of Tangency:** Let (M_1) be the point of tangency where the tangent line (e) is parallel to (BF). This point (M_1) maximizes the perpendicular distance (M_1B) from (M_1) to (BF). 5. **Analyzing the Region and Tangent Line:** The entire arc (AB) of the ellipse lies within the strip defined by the lines (BF) and (e). Only one part of this strip holds points (B) and (M_1). 6. **Conclusion:** Thereby, the sought point (M) on the arc (AB) which maximizes the area of (MBF) is precisely (M_1), the tangency point where the tangent line to the ellipse is parallel to (BF). To find (M_1) geometrically, considering the properties and the definition of the ellipse: 1. **Using the Standard Definitions and Properties of an Ellipse:** If we take specific geometric principles from ellipse properties: - The definition involving foci and the constant total distance. 2. **Construct the Parallel Tangent Line:** - Draw a tangent to the ellipse parallel to (BF). The point of tangency is (M_1). 3. **Parametric Form and Tangent Derivative:** - If we use a parametric form involving the traditional ellipse's components ((a), (b), and the distance (c) between the foci and the center), we can find the exact location of (M_1). 4. **Coordinate Geometry Approach:** - Use the usual coordinate setup for a standard ellipse centered at the origin with major and minor axes lengths (2a) and (2b) respectively. - Given ellipse equation: ( frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 ) - Tangent slope ( -frac{bx}{sqrt{a^2 - x^2}} = -frac{b}{c} ) - Solve for the (x)-coordinate that satisfies this equation.

Since zero cannot be at the thousand's place, there are 2 choices for the thousand's place (either of the two 3's, but they are indistinguishable, so it counts as one choice). 4. For the remaining three places, we have 0, 3, 3. These can be arranged in: - The number of ways to arrange these three digits, considering the repetition of 3's, is given by the formula for permutations of multiset: (frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!dots n_k!}), where (n) is the total number of items to arrange, and (n_1, n_2, dots, n_k) are the frequencies of the distinct items. - Here, (n = 3), (n_1 = 1) (for zero), and (n_2 = 2) (for two 3's), so the number of arrangements is (frac{3!}{1!2!} = 3). 5. Since the choice for the thousand's place is technically only one (choosing any 3), the total number of different four-digit numbers is (1 times 3 = 3).

Determine which combinations of three numbers yield a sum less than that of the other three. **Computing Possible Sums:** Each sum from 6 (1+2+3) to 15 (4+5+6) needs to be evaluated to determine if it can be less than the sum of a different combination of three numbers from the set. **Calculating Sums Less Than Others:** - For a sum of 6, all other sums are greater. - For a sum of 7 (possible by 1+2+4), the sums 8 through 15 are greater. - Continue this method for each possible sum. **Counting Permutations:** For each valid sum pair, count the permutations. For example, if \`{1, 2, 3}\` is one combination, and \`{4, 5, 6}\` is the corresponding greater sum combination, then there are \`3! * 3! = 6 * 6 = 36\` permutations for this pair.

The highest degree term here is a_n x^{2n}. - In [f(x)]^2, square the polynomial to get [f(x)]^2 = left(sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} x^{k}right)^2. The highest degree term here is (a_n x^n)^2 = a_n^2 x^{2n}. - In f(f(x)), substitute f(x) into f, yielding f(f(x)) = fleft(sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k} x^{k}right). The highest degree term here is a_n^{n+1} x^{n^2}. 3. **Equating the highest degree terms**: Since f(x^2)=[f(x)]^2=f(f(x)), we equate the highest degree terms: - a_n x^{2n} = a_n^2 x^{2n} = a_n^{n+1} x^{n^2}. - This implies 2n = n^2 and a_n = a_n^2 = a_n^{n+1}. 4. **Solving for n**: From 2n = n^2, we solve for n: - n^2 - 2n = 0, - n(n - 2) = 0, - n = 0 or n = 2. Since n geq 1, we have n = 2. 5. **Solving for a_n**: Since a_n = a_n^2 = a_n^{n+1} and n = 2, we have a_2 = a_2^2 = a_2^3. - The only non-zero solutions to a_2 = a_2^2 are a_2 = 1. 6. **Form of f(x)**: With n = 2 and a_2 = 1, f(x) = x^2 + bx + c. Substituting into the original conditions: - f(x^2) = (x^2)^2 + b(x^2) + c = x^4 + bx^2 + c, - [f(x)]^2 = (x^2 + bx + c)^2 = x^4 + 2bx^3 + (b^2 + 2c)x^2 + 2bcx + c^2. - Equating terms, b = 0 (to eliminate the x^3 term) and c = 0 (to match the x^2 and constant terms). 7. **Conclusion**: The only polynomial that satisfies all conditions is f(x) = x^2. Thus, there is only one such polynomial function. boxed{textbf{(B)} 1}"},{"prompt":"Monica was saving money for her future. Every week he put 15 into her moneybox.

Establish triangle sections: Divide the hexagon by its diagonal DA, noting that this diagonal splits the internal angles at each vertex it connects (120^circ angles of the hexagon) into two 60^circ angles. This implies that this diagonal bisects the equilateral triangles formed, creating two 30^circ-60^circ-90^circ right triangles. 2.

The domain of f(x) is mathbb{R}. 2. **Evaluating f(0):** To check if f(x) can be an odd function, we first evaluate f(0). We have f(0) = 0|0+a|+b = b. For f(x) to be odd, f(0) must be 0, which implies b = 0. 3. **When b=0, simplifying f(x):** With b=0, the function simplifies to f(x) = x|x+a|. For this to be an odd function, it must hold that f(-x) = -f(x). 4. **Checking the condition for oddness with b=0:** We have f(-x) = -x|-x+a|. For f(x) to be odd, we require -x|-x+a| = -x|x+a|, which simplifies to |-x+a| = |x+a|. This condition implies a=0. 5. **Conclusion on the condition ab=0:** Since for f(x) to be an odd function, we found that both a and b must be 0, the condition \\"ab=0\\" is met when either a=0, b=0, or both. However, for f(x) to be odd, we specifically need both a=0 and b=0.

What about ensuring that every possible triplet appears exactly once on a ticket? And what about the sets of four numbers?","completion":"1. **Part (a): Analyzing Pairs of Numbers** To determine if it is possible to fill out the lottery tickets such that every possible pair of numbers appears on exactly one ticket, let's consider pairs involving the number 1. The possible pairs are: (1, 2), (1, 3), ldots, (1, 90) Thus, there are 89 such pairs since there are 89 numbers from 2 to 90 that can be paired with 1. Now, let's examine a filled lottery ticket. If the number 1 does not appear on this ticket, none of our considered pairs (with 1) will be included on this ticket. If the number 1 appears on the ticket, it must form pairs with each of the other four numbers on the ticket, amounting to 4 pairs. Therefore, if every possible pair must appear exactly once on some ticket, the total number of such pairs (involving 1) must be divisible by 4. However, 89 is not divisible by 4: 89 mod 4 neq 0 Thus, it is impossible to arrange the lottery tickets so that every possible number pair appears exactly once on one ticket. Hence, filling out the tickets in the required manner is not possible for pairs of numbers. 2. **Part (b): Analyzing Triplets of Numbers** Next, let's consider if it is possible for each triplet of numbers to appear exactly once on one ticket. Focus on the triplets containing both numbers 1 and 2. The possible triplets in this case are: (1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), ldots, (1, 2, 90) Hence, there are 88 such triplets since we can choose the third number from 3 to 90. Looking at a filled lottery ticket, if either number 1 or 2 is missing from the ticket, none of these triplets will be included. However, if both 1 and 2 appear on the same ticket, they must appear together with any two out of the remaining four numbers as pairs, leading to 3 triplets. Hence, the number of such triplets involving 1 and 2 must be divisible by 3. But 88 is not divisible by 3: 88 mod 3 neq 0 Hence, it is not possible to arrange the tickets so that each possible triplet of numbers appears exactly once on one ticket. Therefore, filling out the tickets in the required manner is not possible for triplets of numbers. 3. **Part (c): Analyzing Quadruples of Numbers** Lastly, let's consider if each quadruple of numbers can appear exactly once on one ticket. Consider the quadruples containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The possible quadruples are: (1, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2, 3, 5), ldots, (1, 2, 3, 90) Thus, there are 87 such quadruples since the fourth number can be any of the numbers from 4 to 90. On any filled lottery ticket, if any of the numbers 1, 2, or 3 is missing, none of these quadruples can be on the ticket. If all three numbers 1, 2, and 3 are present, then they can form pairs with any one of the remaining four numbers, leading to 2 quadruples. Therefore, for these quadruples to appear exactly once on a ticket, their total count must be divisible by 2. However, 87 is not divisible by 2: 87 mod 2 neq 0 Therefore, it is not possible to fill the lottery tickets such that every possible quadruple of numbers appears exactly once on one ticket. Hence, filling out the tickets in the required manner is not possible for quadruples of numbers. # Conclusion: It is concluded that it is impossible to fill out lottery tickets such that every possible pair, triplet, or quadruple of numbers appears exactly once on one ticket. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given (a > 0), if points (A(a,0)), (B(0,a)), (C(4,0)), (D(6,0)), and (E(0,6)) satisfy that the circumcircle of (triangle ABC) is tangent to line (DE), then the value of (a) is ______.","completion":"From the given conditions, the equation of line (DE) is (x+y-6=0).

The area of one triangle is: [ frac{1}{2} times 1 times 1 = frac{1}{2} quad text{square units} ] Since there are four such triangles, the total area contributed by these triangles is: [ 4 times frac{1}{2} = 2 quad text{square units} ] 4. **Summing up the areas**: Now, combining the areas of the central square and the four corner triangles: [ 9 + 2 = 11 quad text{square units} ] However, on each vertical and horizontal side of the medial 3 times 3 square, there are overlapping triangles on each side, contributing an additional 1 unit square each.

Let the sides of the first triangle be ( a_1, b_1 ) (legs) and ( c_1 ) (hypotenuse), and the sides of the second triangle be ( a_2, b_2 ) (legs) and ( c_2 ) (hypotenuse). 2. Construct quadrilateral ( ABCD ) by choosing points on perpendicular lines from a point ( O ). Specifically, set points such that ( OA = a_1 ), ( OB = b_1 ), ( OC = a_2 ), and ( OD = b_2 ). 3. Verify that the quadrilateral ( ABCD ) is a cyclic quadrilateral. For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the product of the lengths of the diagonals should be equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides: [ OA times OC = OB times OD ] Given the defined lengths, we have: [ a_1 times a_2 = b_1 times b_2 ] 4. Show that this condition is satisfied because ( a_1, b_1, c_1 ) and ( a_2, b_2, c_2 ) are sides of right triangles. Thus, the above product equality will hold due to the properties of the Pythagorean theorem. 5. Calculate the radius ( R ) of the circumcircle of the cyclic quadrilateral. According to Brahmagupta's formula here adapted for squares: [ R^2 = frac{(c_1^2 + c_2^2)}{2} ] Thus, [ R = frac{sqrt{c_1^2 + c_2^2}}{2} ] 6.

Prove that they can be covered by one or several nonoverlapping circles, the sum of the diameters of which is less than 100, and such that the distance between any two points from different circles exceeds 1.","completion":"1. **Initialization** - Consider 100 circles, each with a radius of (frac{1}{2}), centered at the given points. This choice ensures that each point is enclosed within a circle. Therefore, the total sum of the diameters of these circles, initially, is 100 since the diameter of each circle is 1. 2. **Combining Overlapping Circles** - If any two circles ( K_1 ) and ( K_2 ) intersect or touch, replace them with a single larger circle ( K ). The new circle ( K ) should have a diameter equal to the distance between the centers of ( K_1 ) and ( K_2 ) plus the sum of their radii. 3. **Proof of Coverage and Diameter Sum** - Since the larger circle ( K ) completely covers the regions defined by ( K_1 ) and ( K_2 ), all points previously covered remain covered. - The new system of circles still covers all points, and the total number of circles decreases by one. - The sum of the diameters in the new configuration does not exceed the previous sum because the diameter of the newly formed circle ( K ) is not greater than the sum of the diameters of ( K_1 ) and ( K_2 ). 4. **Repetition of Combination Process** - Continue this process of combining intersecting or touching circles. Each iteration reduces the total number of circles while ensuring the sum of diameters does not increase. - Eventually, we achieve a configuration where no circles intersect or touch, potentially leading us to a single encompassing circle. 5. **Minimum Distance Proof** - If the resulting system of circles consists of more than one circle, the minimum distance between any two circles is ensured to be more than 1 because: - The initial distance between points in different circles is at least (frac{1}{2}) within their respective circles. - Each replacement of intersecting circles with a larger circle maintains or increases the minimum distance. 6. **Final Adjustment** - If the sum of the diameters is exactly 100, a slight reduction in the radius of any circle (less than (frac{1}{2})) will achieve the required condition. - Even a minimal reduction ensures that the condition (sum text{diameters} < 100) is met while maintaining coverage of all points. # Conclusion The points can indeed be covered by one or several non-intersecting circles such that the sum of their diameters is less than 100, and the distance between any two points from different circles is more than 1.

The 3 times 4 rectangle requires 4, and the 4 times 5 requires 5; however, the magnitude of 5 covers the requirement for 4, so the vertical dimension required is 5. 4. **Confirm square dimensions**: Both the horizontal and vertical minimum requirements are 7 and 5, respectively.

Part 2: Average Number of Jumps Per Person To find the average number of jumps per person, we first sum up the differences from the standard for all representatives and then divide by the number of representatives, which is 10. Adding the result to the standard (160 jumps) gives us the average number of jumps: [ 160 + frac{16 - 1 + 20 - 2 - 5 + 11 - 7 + 6 + 9 + 13}{10} = 160 + frac{60}{10} = 160 + 6 = 166 text{ jumps} ] Therefore, the average number of jumps per person in the class representatives in one minute is boxed{166 text{ jumps}}. Part 3: Calculation of Total Score and Eligibility for Reward The scoring system adds 1 point for each jump beyond the standard and deducts 0.5 points for each jump below the standard. Calculating the total score: [ (16 + 20 + 11 + 6 + 9 + 13) times 1 - (1 + 2 + 5 + 7) times 0.5 = 75 times 1 - 15 times 0.5 = 75 - 7.5 = 67.5 text{ points} ] Since the total score of 67.5 points is greater than 65 points, the class is eligible for the reward.

Let (frac{a}{b} = frac{m}{n}) for some integers (m) and (n). 6. **Conclusion:** - The relationship between (a) and (b) must be such that (frac{a}{b}) is a rational number.

Let us consider a triangle ABC and a line l that has the property that three lines symmetric to l with respect to the sides of the triangle intersect at one point P. 2. When l is symmetric with respect to a side of the triangle, the symmetric lines also pass through P. We need to show that all such lines l pass through one particular point. 3. The points symmetric to P with respect to the sides of the triangle are reflections of P across these respective sides. 4. By definition, the perpendicular dropped from P to any side of the triangle will land on the side at a point equidistant from its reflection point through l. 5. According to the Simson line theorem, the three perpendicular projections of point P onto the sides of ABC are collinear if and only if P lies on the circumcircle of ABC. This means point P must lie on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. This supports our reflection property. 6. From the properties of the Simson line, any line l passing through P and symmetrical with respect to the sides of triangle ABC guarantees that point P lies on the circumcircle. 7. Additionally, the Simson line from point P divides the segment joining P and the orthocenter H of triangle ABC into two equal parts. This implies that line l must pass through H, given that the bisector nature holds. 8.

From working at the card shop: She worked 2 hours every afternoon for 5 days a week at 12.50 an hour. So, she earned 2 hours/day * 12.50/hour * 5 days = 125.00 from the card shop.

This approach leverages the properties of squares modulo 4 and helps us show the non-existence of such integers ( a ) and ( b ). 1. **Understanding squares modulo 4:** The first step involves understanding how squares of integers behave under modulo 4. Let's consider the possible remainders when any integer is divided by 4: - If ( a equiv 0 pmod{4} ), then ( a^2 equiv 0^2 equiv 0 pmod{4} ). - If ( a equiv 1 pmod{4} ), then ( a^2 equiv 1^2 equiv 1 pmod{4} ). - If ( a equiv 2 pmod{4} ), then ( a^2 equiv 2^2 equiv 4 equiv 0 pmod{4} ). - If ( a equiv 3 pmod{4} ), then ( a^2 equiv 3^2 equiv 9 equiv 1 pmod{4} ). Therefore, the squares of any integer modulo 4 can only be 0 or 1. This implies: [ a^2 equiv 0 quad text{or} quad 1 pmod{4} ] Similarly: [ b^2 equiv 0 quad text{or} quad 1 pmod{4} ] 2. **Combination of squares modulo 4:** Now consider the sum ( a^2 + b^2 ).

However, the product ( P(-1) ) is also positive by assumption. 5. **Relate the desired quantity to the polynomial and its derivative:** We need to show that: [ frac{1}{a-1} + frac{1}{b-1} + frac{1}{c-1} + frac{1}{d-1} > 0 ] This can be rewritten using the derivative of ( P(x) ): [ frac{1}{a-1} + frac{1}{b-1} + frac{1}{c-1} + frac{1}{d-1} = -frac{P'(1)}{P(1)} ] 6. **Analyze the sign of ( P'(1) ):** Since ( P(x) ) has 4 real roots all outside the interval ([-1, 1]), the derivative ( P'(x) ) at ( x = 1 ) must be negative. This is because the slope of the polynomial at ( x = 1 ) is decreasing due to the roots being outside the interval. 7. **Conclude the inequality:** Since ( P(1) ) is positive and ( P'(1) ) is negative, the fraction ( -frac{P'(1)}{P(1)} ) is positive.

Thus, ( m ) can only have even prime divisors, or ( m = 2^k ). Applying Property 2, it follows that ( m = 4^k ). 4. **Verification:** We check and see that ( 4^k ) is a happy number. Indeed, [ 4^k = frac{(2^k)^2 cdot 2^{k-1}}{2^k - 2^{k-1}}. ] From Property 2, it follows that for any happy number ( n ), there exists an odd prime divisor of ( d(n) ).

[ sum_{i=n+1}^{2n} a_i leq 0 tag{1} ] 5. **Claim:** For every (2 leq m leq n+1), we have [ sum_{i=m}^{n+m-1} a_i > 0 tag{2} ] 6. **Proof by Induction:** - **Base Case:** For (m = 2), we need to show (sum_{i=2}^{n+1} a_i > 0). From (1) and the fact that (a_{n+1} geq a_1), we have: [ sum_{i=2}^{n+1} a_i geq sum_{i=1}^n a_i = sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_i - sum_{i=n+1}^{2n} a_i > 0 ] This establishes the base case. - **Inductive Step:** Suppose (2) holds for some (2 leq m leq n+1). We need to show it holds for (m+1). Notice that from our hypothesis: [ sum_{i=n+m+1}^{2n+m} a_i leq 0 ] Hence, [ sum_{i=m+1}^{n+m} a_i = sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_i - sum_{i=n+m+1}^{2n+m} a_i > 0 ] This completes the inductive step. 7. By substituting (m = n+1) into (2), we get: [ sum_{i=n+1}^{2n} a_i > 0 ] This is a contradiction to (1). Therefore, our initial assumption that the condition is not satisfied must be false. Hence, at least one of the numbers has a positive sum for both sets of (n) numbers. (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Given ain R, the function f(x)=ln xax.

The axis of symmetry for this parabola is the line x = -1. For a point P(m, n) on this graph to be the center of a circle with radius 2 that intersects the y-axis, the distance from P to the y-axis must be less than or equal to 2. This is because the circle must reach the y-axis to intersect it. The distance from P to the y-axis is the absolute value of the x-coordinate of P, which leads to the inequality: [ -2 < m < 2 ] This inequality ensures that the circle with center P and radius 2 will intersect the y-axis. To find the range of n, we consider the points where m is at the extremes of its range. When m = 2, the point P is on the graph of the quadratic function, so we substitute x = 2 into the equation to find n: [ n = (2)^2 + 2(2) + 2 = 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 ] When m = -1, which is the x-coordinate of the vertex, n = 1 because the vertex of the parabola is at (-1, 1). Therefore, the range of values for n is from 1 to just below 10, since n = 10 is only reached when m = 2, and the circle's radius extends from the point on the graph.

If the circles have equal or unequal radii, adjust the interpretation: - For equal-sized circles: Analyze symmetrical behavior concerning external tangents. - For different-sized circles: One tangent may be limited while the other extends indefinitely. 5. **Illustrative Example:** To visualize, draw the two circles, add the external common tangents, and shade the regions outside these tangents. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the points in the exterior regions (outside the external tangents of these circles) are those from which one fence necessarily obstructs the view of the other.

The additional 2 days' distribution depends on the day of the week the month starts. 2. **Modulo Calculation**: Since 30 equiv 2 pmod{7}, the first day of the month determines which days will be the extra days. 3. **Analyzing Each Starting Day**: - Starts on **Sunday**: Extra days are Sunday, Monday.

In the quadrilateral, angle EGH = 50^circ and angle EFG = 20^circ. Calculate the sum of angle GEF + angle EHG.","completion":"First, we calculate the central angles corresponding to the given angles in the circle: - Since angle EGH = 50^circ, the central angle over arc EH must be twice as large, so it is 100^circ. - Similarly, angle EFG = 20^circ, so the central angle over arc EF must be double that, resulting in 40^circ. To find the central angles corresponding to arcs FG and GE, we use: - Total degrees in a circle = 360^circ. - The sum of the central angles over arcs EH and EF is 100^circ + 40^circ = 140^circ. - Consequently, the sum of the central angles over arcs FG and GE must be 360^circ - 140^circ = 220^circ. Since the question asks for the sum of angle GEF + angle EHG, and knowing that these angles are inscribed angles corresponding to arcs FG and GE respectively, we need half of 220^circ: - angle GEF + angle EHG = frac{220^circ}{2} = 110^circ.

The number of votes against the proposal is ( 0.40x ) (since it's 40% of the total). The number of votes in favor of the proposal is ( 0.40x + 58 ).

The number of votes against the proposal is ( 0.45y ) (since it's 45% of the total). The number of votes in favor of the proposal is ( 0.45y + 72 ).

The number of votes against the proposal is ( 0.55z ) (since it's 55% of the total). The number of votes in favor of the proposal is ( 0.55z + 30 ).

The formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is: S = n(n + 1) / 2 We need to find a value of n such that the sum is just above 575, because the student's incorrect sum is 575, which means he missed one number that would make the sum slightly larger.

Hence, f(x)=e^{x}-2x, f′(x)=e^{x}-2. Let f′(x)=0, we get x=ln 2. When x < ln 2, f′(x) < 0, the function f(x) is monotonically decreasing; when x > ln 2, f′(x) > 0, the function f(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, when x=ln 2, the function f(x) reaches its minimum value, which is f(ln 2)=2-2ln 2, and there is no maximum value. (II) Proof: Let g(x)=e^{x}-x^{2}, then g′(x)=e^{x}-2x. From (I), we know that g′(x)=f(x)≥slant f(ln 2) > 0, hence g(x) is monotonically increasing on R. Therefore, when x > 0, g(x) > g(0)=1 > 0, hence x^{2} < e^{x}.

From (II), we know that when x > 0, e^{x} > x^{2}, hence h′(x) < 0, h(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,+∞). Hence, h(x) < h(0)=-1 < 0, i.e., dfrac {1}{3}x^{3} < e^{x}. Take x_{0}= dfrac {3}{c}, when x > x_{0}, we have dfrac {1}{c}x^{2} < dfrac {1}{3}x^{3} < e^{x}. Therefore, for any given positive number c, there always exists x_{0}, such that when x∈(x_{0},+∞), it always holds that x^{2} < ce^{x}. Method 2: For any given positive number c, take x_{0}= dfrac {4}{ sqrt {c}}. From (II), we know that when x > 0, e^{x} > x^{2}, hence e^{x}=e^{ frac {x}{2}}cdot e^{ frac {x}{2}} > ( dfrac {x}{2})^{2}⋅( dfrac {x}{2})^{2}. When x > x_{0}, e^{x} > ( dfrac {x}{2})^{2}⋅( dfrac {x}{2})^{2} > dfrac {4}{c}⋅ ( dfrac {x}{2})^{2}= dfrac {1}{c}x^{2}. For any given positive number c, there always exists x_{0}, such that when x∈(x_{0},+∞), it always holds that x^{2} < ce^{x}. Method 3: ① If cgeqslant 1, then e^{x}leqslant ce^{x}. From (II), we know that when x > 0, e^{x} > x^{2}, hence when x > 0, ce^{x} > x^{2}. Take x_{0}=0, when x∈(x_{0},+∞), it always holds that x^{2} < ce^{x}. ② If 0 < c < 1, let k= dfrac {1}{c} > 1. In order to make the inequality x^{2} < ce^{x} hold, it is sufficient to make e^{x} > kx^{2} hold. In order to make e^{x} > kx^{2} hold, it is sufficient to make x > ln (kx^{2}), i.e., x > 2ln x+ln k. Let h(x)=x-2ln x-ln k, then h′(x)=1- dfrac {2}{x}= dfrac {x-2}{x}. Hence, when x > 2, h′(x) > 0, h(x) is monotonically increasing on (2,+∞). Take x_{0}=16k > 16, hence h(x) is monotonically increasing on (x_{0},+∞). Also, h(x_{0})=16k-2ln (16k)-ln k=8(k-ln 2)+3(k-ln k)+5k. It is easy to know that k > ln k, k > ln 2, 5k > 0. Hence, h(x_{0}) > 0, i.e., there exists x_{0}= dfrac {16}{c}, when x∈(x_{0},+∞), it always holds that x^{2} < ce^{x}.

However, our condition only guarantees P subseteq Q. Since there could exist elements in Q that are not in P when P is a proper subset of Q, option A is incorrect. - **Option B**: If x notin Q, then it cannot be in P either since P subseteq Q.

Let us consider the arc between these two pieces, denoted by these steps: 3. **Analyzing the Arc:** - Focus on the segment of the circle that forms an open arc defined by the path from the white piece labeled 1 to the black piece labeled 1, moving clockwise. - Our goal is to minimize the number of pieces in this arc, not including the endpoints. 4. **Possible Cases in the Open Arc:** - **If the arc consists of pieces of one color only:** - If the arc consists entirely of white pieces, then these white pieces must be labeled 2, cdots, k, for some k < n. Hence our chosen arc does not contain a complete set 1, 2, cdots, n. - If the arc consists entirely of black pieces, a contradiction arises as described further below. 5. **Contradiction in Mixing Colors:** - If there were pieces of both colors in the arc with labels forming a complete set 1, 2, cdots, n, then the open arc defined by the pieces labeled n would contradict by being shorter in the number of intermediate pieces, which is impossible by minimality assumption. 6. **Cases Resolving into Contradiction:** - If the open arc consists only of black pieces without white pieces or vice versa, arguments show contradiction due to the circular labeling clockwise and counterclockwise inherently covering the arc. **Detailed Proof Outline:** 1. Assume an open arc A of white pieces labeled {2, 3, ..., k} for k < n. Start considering from label 1 and proceed counterclockwise to form {1, 2, ..., n} within the arc ignoring the open nature. 2. If arranged similarly with black pieces, repeat contradiction arguments identifying intermediate steps minimize covering entire labels. *Examples for visualization can include diagrams or step-wise arcs arranged with specific instances of pieces.* 7. **Conclusion:** The existence of a contiguous sequence of n pieces labeled from 1, 2, cdots, n occurs due to invariance along the circular arrangement without isolated color labeling possible consistently.

Therefore, set N can be expressed as: N = [1, +infty). Finally, to find the intersection of N and complement_U M, we simply intersect the intervals corresponding to each set: N cap (complement_U M) = [1, +infty) cap [0, 2] = [1, 2].

Since {a_n} is a geometric sequence and its common ratio q satisfies |q| > 1, we can determine the possible consecutive terms by considering the absolute values of terms in the sequence and the fact that negative terms appear alternately due to the property q < 0 (as a geometric sequence with |q| > 1 cannot have decreasing absolute values if q were positive). By arranging the absolute values of the elements in ascending order, we get the sequence 18, -24, 36, -54, 81.

We need to show that ( I ) is the midpoint of ( DE ), where a circle inside the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) touches ( CA ) and ( BC ) at points ( D ) and ( E ) respectively. 2. **Construction:** Let us draw the line through ( I ) perpendicular to ( CI ) and let it meet the sides ( CA ) and ( CB ) at points ( D' ) and ( E' ) respectively. 3. **Symmetry:** Notice that due to symmetry, the perpendiculars from ( I ) to ( CA ) and ( CB ), splitting ( CA ) and ( CB ) at exactly the same distance from ( I ), imply that ( I ) is the midpoint of ( D'E' ). 4. **Similarity of triangles:** By construction, triangles ( IE'X ) and ( D'E'Y ) are similar, where ( X ) and ( Y ) are the feet of the perpendiculars from ( I ) and ( D' ) on ( CB ). This similarity leads to ( D'Y = 2cdot IE' = 2r ). 5. **Expressing ( CD' ):** Next, we express ( CD' ) as follows: [ CD' = 2r / sin C = frac{rs}{sin C} = frac{text{Area of } triangle ABC}{s sin C} = frac{frac{1}{2} ab sin C}{s sin C} = frac{ab}{s} ] Thus, it is shown that ( CD' = frac{ab}{s} ). 6. **Sufficiency:** It is sufficient to show that ( CD = CE = frac{ab}{s} ). 7. **Inverting with respect to ( C ):** Consider an inversion with respect to ( C ) where a point at a distance ( k ) from ( C ) inverts to a point on the same line but at a distance ( frac{ab}{k} ) from ( C ). 8. **Image of points under inversion:** Under this inversion: - ( A ) maps to ( A' ) on the line ( CA ) such that ( A'C = a ), - ( B ) maps to ( B' ) on the line ( CB ) such that ( B'C = b ), - Thus, ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle B'A'C ) are congruent. 9. **Circumcircle becomes ( A'B' ):** The circumcircle under this inversion becomes the line ( A'B' ). 10. **Inner circle transformation:** The inner circle initially touches ( CA ), ( CB ), and the circumcircle, so after inversion, it transforms to a circle touching ( CA' ), ( CB' ), and ( A'B' ). This implies it becomes the excircle of ( triangle A'B'C ) opposite ( C ). 11. **Calculating distance under inversion:** Suppose ( D ) maps to ( D'' ) under inversion. Let ( A'D'' = x ). Using tangent chasing: [ a + x = b + c - x implies 2x = b + c - a implies x = s - a ] Then from the inversion, ( CD'' = s ), thereby: [ CD = frac{ab}{s} ] Similarly for ( CE ), proving our required lengths. 12. **Conclusion:** Hence, it is established that ( I ) is indeed the midpoint of ( DE ).

Since the area of a circle (or semi-circle) is proportional to the square of its radius (pi r^2), reducing the radius by a factor of frac{1}{2} reduces the area by a factor of left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 = frac{1}{4}. 2. **Calculating the combined area of the semi-circles as a fraction of a full circle with diameter overline{AB}**: The larger semi-circle with diameter overline{AB} represents frac{1}{2} of a full circle with diameter overline{AB}. The smaller semi-circle, being frac{1}{4} the area of the larger, contributes an additional frac{1}{8} of a full circle with diameter overline{AB}. Together, they represent frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{8} = frac{5}{8} of a full circle with diameter overline{AB}. 3. **Determining the area represented by the region split by segment overline{CP}**: Since segment overline{CP} divides the combined area of the semi-circles into two equal parts, each part represents half of frac{5}{8} of a full circle with diameter overline{AB}. Therefore, each part is frac{5}{16} of a full circle with diameter overline{AB}. 4. **Calculating the degree measure of angle ACP based on the area it encompasses**: The full circle corresponds to 360^circ.

Let's break down the problem into two parts: 1. The probability of getting two consecutive heads after the first three tails. 2. The probability of rolling a number greater than 4 on the die. For the first part, we need to find the probability of getting two consecutive heads (HH) after the first three tails (TTT). Since the coin tosses are independent events, the past outcomes do not affect the future outcomes. Therefore, the probability of getting HH after TTT is the same as getting HH in any two consecutive tosses. The probability of getting heads on a single toss is 1/2. To get two consecutive heads, we multiply the probabilities: P(HH) = P(H) * P(H) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 For the second part, once we have two consecutive heads, we toss the die. The probability of rolling a number greater than 4 (i.e., getting a 5 or 6) is: P(Die > 4) = P(5 or 6) = P(5) + P(6) = (1/6) + (1/6) = 2/6 = 1/3 Now, we combine the two probabilities. Since these are sequential events, we multiply the probabilities: P(HH and Die > 4) = P(HH) * P(Die > 4) = (1/4) * (1/3) = 1/12 Therefore, the probability that the die shows a number greater than 4 after the first three throws of the coin resulted in a tail is boxed{1/12} ."},{"prompt":"A basketball must have a circumference of (29.5) inches.

Without loss of generality, considering angle C = 90^circ, point C would be either directly above or below the midpoint of AB along x=0. 4. **Calculating Position of C**: Suppose C is at (0, y_C). Using the midpoint formula, M = left( 0, 25 right) is the midpoint of AB and must also be the foot of the perpendicular from C. Since it is an isosceles right triangle, the legs are equal. The length of leg AB = 10 (from -5 to 5). The other leg, the vertical distance from y=25 to y_C, therefore also equals 10. Thus, if the triangle opens upwards, y_C = 25 + 10 = 35.

Assume the points where the perpendiculars from (D) and (B) to (AC) intersect (AC) are denoted as (T_1) and (T_2), respectively. Step 2: According to the problem, the diagonal (AC) divides the quadrilateral (ABCD) into two regions of equal area. Therefore, the triangles ( triangle ADC ) and ( triangle ABC ) must have equal areas. Since these triangles share the base (AC) and have equal areas, the heights from (D) and (B) to (AC) must be equal. Thus, the lengths of the segments ( DT_1 ) and ( BT_2 ) are equal. Step 3: Next, consider triangles ( triangle DT_1M ) and ( triangle BT_2M ). Since (DT_1 = BT_2) and both (T_1) and (T_2) are the feet of the perpendiculars to (AC), the angles (angle T_1MD) and (angle T_2MB) are right angles. Additionally, the angle (angle T_1MT_2) is common to both triangles. Therefore, (triangle DT_1M cong triangle BT_2M) by the RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side) congruence criterion. Step 4: Since triangles ( triangle DT_1M ) and ( triangle BT_2M ) are congruent, the segments (DM) and (MB) must be equal (since these are corresponding sides in the congruent triangles). Therefore, the diagonal (AC) bisects the diagonal (BD) at (M). Step 5: By similar arguments, considering the equal areas generated by the diagonal (BD), we show that the diagonal (BD) bisects the diagonal (AC) at (M). Conclusion: Since the diagonals of quadrilateral (ABCD) bisect each other, (ABCD) must be a parallelogram.

Consider a grid of 16 points, (i,j), where 0 leqslant i leqslant 3 and 0 leqslant j leqslant 3. We are asked to determine the minimum value of n such that any selected set of n points contains four points that form the vertices of a square. 2. By examining different configurations, it can be established that in a 4 times 4 grid, when we randomly remove certain points, it directly influences the formation of squares. For example, if the number of points is less than 11, we can arrange them such that no four points form the vertices of a square. This is explained as follows: - If n = 10 (or fewer), we might be able to position these points without forming any square. Refer to some configurations when no four points form the vertices of a perfect square. - However, if we have the 11 points, there is inevitably a set of four points that can form the vertices of a square. 3. Let’s prove that having 11 points ensures a square. - **Subgrid Argument**: Consider a 3 times 3 subgrid within the larger 4 times 4 grid. If we choose 7 points from these 9 points, it is guaranteed that at least 4 of them will form a square within this 3 times 3 subgrid. This follows from the pigeonhole principle and combinatorial arguments. 4. Extend this argument to the full 4 times 4 grid as follows: - **Larger Grid Argument**: Given the structure of the grid, the subsets of points maintain the properties of formulating smaller grids with forced squares. Removing certain points, as in our earlier configuration, leads us inevitably to a point where all combinations are tried and exceed safe limits (( geq 7 ) in a 2 times 3 grid guarantees forming squares). 5. To ensure clarity and completeness, let's refocus on Howel’s principle: - Any larger combination that passes the threshold maintains the intrinsic forcing behavior in increasingly large grids.

Therefore, AB=14 and BC=20, so we have boxed{AB=14, BC=20}.

When PQ=10, it's clear that t=10 for the initial phase. For 14 < t leq 34, point Q moves at 3 units per second after a 14 second delay, so its position is -24+3(t-14)=3t-66.

Apply a stretching transformation relative to the diagonal ( A_n A_{2n} ) with a coefficient ( k > 1 ).

For proposition p: |1-x| leq 2, it can be transformed into -2 leq 1-x leq 2, which further simplifies to -1 leq x leq 3. Therefore, the negation of p, neg p, implies x < -1 or x > 3. For proposition q: x^2 - 2x + 1 - m^2 leq 0, we can rewrite it as (x-1)^2 leq m^2. This indicates that the distance between x and 1 is less than or equal to m on the number line, which can be expressed as 1-m leq x leq 1+m. The negation of q, neg q, therefore means x < 1-m or x > 1+m. Given that neg p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for neg q, it implies that the range of x for neg p must be entirely contained within the range of x for neg q. This leads to the conditions 1-m < -1 and 1+m > 3. Solving these inequalities gives m > 2 and m > 2, respectively. However, to ensure that neg p is not a sufficient condition for neg q, the range of m must be such that there exists some x that satisfies neg p but does not satisfy neg q. This is achieved when m is large enough to make the interval 1-m to 1+m cover the entire interval -1 to 3 and beyond. Therefore, the smallest value of m that satisfies this condition is when 1+m = 3, which gives m = 2.

Given the options provided and the corrected understanding that there seems to be a mistake in the solution's explanation, we should align the logic with the options given: A polygon that forms 2023 triangles by connecting a point on one side to all vertices suggests we are dealing with a polygon that has one more side than the number of triangles, because starting from a side (not a vertex) implies the polygon has 2023 + 1 = 2024 sides.

Similarly, cut through vertical lines with an even number giving us n vertical cuts. 3. This operation transforms the 2n times 2n board into a 3n times 3n board (although it may get divided into unequal cells). We will hereafter refer to this board as the new board. Each individual cell of the old board will now either correspond to one, two, or four cells of the new board (depending on whether zero, one, or both coordinates of the old cell were even numbers). 4. Each individual domino after this operation will either become a trimino or a 2 times 3 or 3 times 2 rectangle. 5. Next, split each of these rectangles 2 times 3 or 3 times 2 into two triminoes. Consequently, we obtain a new division for the 3n times 3n board into triminoes. 6. To prove that different divisions of a 2n times 2n board into dominoes will result in different divisions of a 3n times 3n board into triminoes, we assume the opposite: Let two different divisions of the 2n times 2n board into dominoes lead to the same division of the 3n times 3n board into triminoes. 7. Since the divisions into dominoes are different, there exists at least one cell ( A ) of the 2n times 2n board that is covered differently by the two divisions. 8. After our transformation, the entity into which cell ( A ) transforms (which can be one, two, or four cells) will be covered differently by triminoes in the two transformed divisions. 9. Therefore, the divisions into triminoes are also different, leading to a contradiction. Hence, we have established that all divisions into triminoes are different and at least as numerous as those into dominoes. 10. To prove further, we identify a specific division 3n times 3n into triminoes that does not derive from the 2n times 2n domino division. 11. Consider a division where a horizontal trimino is placed in the bottom-right corner and three vertical triminoes are aligned next to it (an example illustrated by the given figure). 12.

If (k geq p), we can replace (k) with (k mod p) because (p mid (n + k^2)) implies (p mid (n + (k mod p)^2)). 2. **Rewrite (n) in the desired form**: We need to express (n) as (n = ab + bc + ca). This can be rewritten as: [ n = c(a + b) + ab ] This implies that (a + b) must divide (n - ab). 3. **Choose (a = k) and (b = p - k)**: Let (a = k) and (b = p - k). Then, we have: [ a + b = k + (p - k) = p ] Since (p mid (n + k^2)), we can write: [ n + k^2 = mp quad text{for some integer } m ] Therefore: [ n = mp - k^2 ] 4. **Determine (c)**: We need to find (c) such that: [ c = frac{n - k(p - k)}{p} ] Substituting (n = mp - k^2) into the equation, we get: [ c = frac{mp - k^2 - k(p - k)}{p} = frac{mp - k^2 - kp + k^2}{p} = frac{mp - kp}{p} = m - k ] Thus, (c = m - k). 5. **Verify distinctness and positivity**: We need to ensure that (a), (b), and (c) are distinct and positive integers. - (a = k) - (b = p - k) - (c = m - k) Since (k < p), (a) and (b) are distinct. Also, since (p leq 2sqrt{n}), (m) is an integer such that (m geq 1). Therefore, (c = m - k) is positive if (m > k). 6. **Check for contradictions**: - If (a = c), then (k = m - k), which implies (2k = m). This would mean (2k leq 2sqrt{n}), but since (n) is square-free and even, this leads to a contradiction. - If (b = c), then (p - k = m - k), which implies (p = m).

Along the boundary of this grid (excluding the corners), we have a total of 4 cdot 99 = 396 nodes. These nodes can be categorized evenly into black and white due to the chessboard coloring pattern. 4. Each piecewise linear path (broken line) adheres to the following constraints: - It travels strictly within the grid. - It ends at the boundary of the grid but avoids intersecting at other nodes. - Each path starts and ends on nodes of different colors. 5. Since the paths are non-intersecting and end on the boundary nodes, there will be an equal number of paths terminating at black and white nodes on the boundary to keep the coloring balanced. 6. Each interior node, if belonging to a path, makes the number of black nodes equal to the number of white nodes used in the paths crossing inside the grid. 7.

The possible values of xi are -90, 50, 80, and 220 thousand dollars. - P(xi = -90) occurs when both products fail, which has a probability of (1-frac{3}{4})(1-frac{3}{5}) = frac{1}{4} times frac{2}{5} = frac{2}{20} = frac{1}{10}. - P(xi = 50) occurs when product A fails and product B succeeds, which has a probability of (1-frac{3}{4}) times frac{3}{5} = frac{1}{4} times frac{3}{5} = frac{3}{20}. - P(xi = 80) occurs when product A succeeds and product B fails, which has a probability of frac{3}{4} times (1-frac{3}{5}) = frac{3}{4} times frac{2}{5} = frac{6}{20} = frac{3}{10}. - P(xi = 220) occurs when both products succeed, which has a probability of frac{3}{4} times frac{3}{5} = frac{9}{20}.

According to the problem, if Jake loses 8 pounds, he will weigh twice as much as Kendra. So we can write the equation: J - 8 = 2K (1) We also know that together they now weigh 293 pounds, so we can write another equation: J + K = 293 (2) Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve for one of the variables and then substitute it into the other equation. From equation (2), we can solve for K: K = 293 - J (3) Now we can substitute equation (3) into equation (1): J - 8 = 2(293 - J) Expanding the right side of the equation, we get: J - 8 = 586 - 2J Now, we can add 2J to both sides of the equation to get all the J terms on one side: J + 2J - 8 = 586 Combining like terms, we get: 3J - 8 = 586 Now, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with J: 3J = 586 + 8 3J = 594 Finally, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for J: J = 594 / 3 J = 198 So, Jake's present weight is boxed{198} pounds."},{"prompt":"Two trains 220 m and 300 m long run at the speed of 80 km/hr and 55 km/hr respectively in opposite directions on parallel tracks.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together. The speed of the first train is 80 km/hr, and the speed of the second train is 55 km/hr. Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 80 km/hr + 55 km/hr Relative speed = 135 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second because the lengths of the trains are given in meters. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 135 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (135 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (15 * 5) m/s Relative speed = 75 m/s The total distance to be covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths: Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 220 m + 300 m Total distance = 520 m Now, we can find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other by dividing the total distance by the relative speed: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 520 m / 75 m/s Time = 6.9333... seconds So, the two trains take approximately boxed{6.93} seconds to cross each other."},{"prompt":"f log_{p}{y}cdot log_{3}{p} = 4, then y equals: A) 64 B) 81 C) 243 D) 9 E) 512","completion":"Given the equation: [ log_{p}{y} cdot log_{3}{p} = 4 ] We apply the properties of logarithms: [ log_{p}{y} cdot log_{3}{p} = log_{3}{y} ] Thus, the equation simplifies to: [ log_{3}{y} = 4 ] From which it follows that: [ y = 3^4 ] Calculating 3^4, we find: [ y = 81 ] Hence, the value of ( y ) is ( 81 ).

Check the validity of this theorem for quadrilaterals.","completion":"Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step to demonstrate the validity of the theorem for both triangles and quadrilaterals. 1. We start with a triangle triangle ABC. Let's denote the points dividing the sides of triangle ABC in the same ratio as A_1, B_1, and C_1. 2. To proceed, we draw the median A_2C_2 of triangle ABCnucleotide. 3. Suppose the median A_2C_2 intersects the side of triangle triangle A_1 B_1 C_1 at point P. 4. According to the result of a previous problem, it's known that B_1 P is the median of triangle triangle A_1 B_1 C_1 and it also intersects the median CC_2 of triangle triangle ABC at point M, such that (C_{2}M : M C = P M : M B_{1} = 1 : 2). Therefore, point M is the common centroid of both triangles triangle ABC and triangle A_1 B_1 C_1. To generalize this theorem for quadrilaterals, we proceed as follows: 1. Let's consider a quadrilateral ABCD. Construct the quadrilateral A_{2} B_{2} C_{2} D_{2} whose vertices are the midpoints of the sides of the original quadrilateral ABCD. 2. The sides A_2 B_2, B_2 C_2, C_2 D_2, and D_2 A_2 of this new quadrilateral will intersect the sides of another quadrilateral A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1} at points M, N, P, and Q respectively. 3. Because the points A, A_1, A_2, B and B, B_1, B_2, C are similar based on Problem 232, we conclude that points M, N, P, and Q are midpoints of the sides A_{1} B_{1}, B_{1} C_{1}, C_{1} D_{1}, and D_{1}A_{2} respectively. 4. The quadrilateral MNQP and A_2 B_2 C_2 D_2 are parallelograms. Both parallelograms must share a common symmetric center, which serves as the common centroid of both quadrilaterals ABCD and A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}.

How many liars could there be in total at the table?","completion":"1. Consider a scenario where everyone at the table is either a knight or a liar. The possible cases are: - All 120 people are liars. - All 120 people are knights. In both cases, these setups are feasible because: - If everyone is a liar, the statement “My neighbor to the right is a knight” is false for all, which makes sense as they are all lying. - If everyone is a knight, the statement “My neighbor to the right is a knight” is true for all, which is consistent because they all tell the truth. 2. Suppose there are both knights and liars present. Let's denote: - ( R ) for a knight (who always tells the truth). - ( L ) for a liar (who always lies). We need to analyze where the knight ( R ) and the liar ( L ) would sit and what they would say based on the two given statements: - Statement 1: \\"My neighbor to the right is a knight.\\" - Statement 2: \\"The person two seats to my right is a knight.\\" 3. Consider a liar ( L ). If ( L ) makes statement 1 (\\"My neighbor to the right is a knight\\"), this statement would be false since he is lying. That would mean his neighbor on the right is not a knight, i.e., it must be a liar too, leading to a contradiction as a liar cannot surround another liar in a stable pattern. 4. Consequently, liar ( L ) must be making statement 2 (\\"The person two seats to my right is a knight\\"). Thus the person directly to ( L )'s right (denote as ( N )) must also be a liar (to maintain the falsehood needed for ( L )'s statement). If ( N ) is a liar and lies as well: - Given ( N ) says statement 2, it means ( N )'s neighbor after ( N ) (i.e., two seats from ( L )) is a knight. - Hence, there is a knight ( R ) two seats to the right of every liar ( L ). 5. Therefore, in this way, knights and liars alternate around the table. Given that there are 120 seats: - The total number of knights and liars will each be half the total, i.e., ( 60 ). 6.

We are given that ( c = 1.3 ) km/hr. When the man rows downstream, the effective speed is ( v + c ) because the current assists him. When he rows upstream, the effective speed is ( v - c ) because he has to row against the current. We are also given that it takes him twice as long to row upstream as to row downstream. This means that the distance covered downstream in a certain time is the same as the distance covered upstream in twice that time. Let's denote the time taken to row downstream as ( t ) hours. Then the time taken to row upstream is ( 2t ) hours. The distance covered downstream in time ( t ) is ( (v + c)t ), and the distance covered upstream in time ( 2t ) is ( (v - c)2t ).

Thus, his options shrink to the intervals [0, frac{m}{2} - 1.5] and [frac{m}{2} + 1.5, m]. Each of these intervals has a length of frac{m}{2} - 1.5. As the game proceeds, every next number must be chosen 1.5 units away from any existing number. If Alice and Bob continue choosing midpoints of the largest available interval, the intervals diminish by at least 3 units in total length (1.5 units on each side of a chosen number). Considering the progression: - The initial choice splits the interval into about frac{m}{2} each. - Each player in subsequent turns effectively reduces the largest interval's size approximately by 3 units. To analyze the endgame, we notice: - Eventually, the players will reach small intervals where it's impossible to place a number. The player forcing the other into an interval smaller than 1.5 loses. Since Alice has the advantage of the first move, dividing the interval optimally every time, she might force Bob into a situation where he can't make a valid move if m decreases systematically every round. The crucial thing is Alice's ability to keep her choices such that Bob receives the smaller remaining interval every round due to the strategic division.

For which values of n is the described situation possible?","completion":"To solve the given problem, we need to figure out the values of n for which the described situation is possible. Here's a step-by-step approach: 1. **Understand the problem:** We are given an inscribed n-gon (n>3) that is divided into triangles by non-intersecting diagonals. Each resulting triangle is similar to at least one of the other triangles. We need to identify the possible values of n. 2. **Key observation:** When n is even, specifically if n=2k, a regular n-gon can be divided in a symmetrical manner. We can draw a diagonal through the center, dividing the n-gon into two identical polygons (each a k-gon). Then, each of these k-gons can be symmetrically divided further into triangles, which results in similar triangles overall. 3. **Example for even n:** - Take n=4 (a square): [ begin{tikzpicture} draw[thick] (0,0) -- (2,0) -- (2,2) -- (0,2) -- cycle; draw[thick] (0,0) -- (2,2); draw[thick] (2,0) -- (0,2); end{tikzpicture} ] The diagonal divides the square into two triangles which are exactly similar. 4. **Generalize for larger even n:** - If n=2k, draw a diagonal through the center of the inscribed circle, dividing the n-gon into two k-gons. Proceed similarly to divide each k-gon. The smaller triangles will be similar due to the symmetry of the division. 5. **Odd n greater than 5:** - If n is odd and greater than 5, consider special constructs. It's possible to arrange diagonals such that some triangles can share similarity properties with others. Thus, the condition will still hold. An example configuration can be constructed, demonstrating that it is possible for some odd numbers. 6. **Special case n=5:** - For n=5 (a pentagon), analyze if the center lies on a diagonal or not. - If the center does not lie on a diagonal, the triangles resulting from the diagonals all intersecting at the center will have different angles, leading either to acutely angled or obtusely angled triangles, making similarity impossible. - If the center lies on one of the diagonals, the two triangles adjacent along this diagonal will be right-angled, while triangles formed in other parts will be obtusely angled. Thus, no similarity can be achieved. 7. **Conclusion:** Based on the observations and demonstrations above, the described situation is only possible when n is an even number or when n is an odd number greater than 5. However, for n=5, the situation is impossible. Therefore, the given conditions hold true for n = 4 and n > 5.

We need to determine if it is possible, through a series of such moves, to encounter every possible arrangement of the two pieces on the board exactly once. To solve this problem, we follow a structured approach using proof by contradiction and permutations. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Modeling Moves and Permutations**: - Consider the board as a grid where each move of the pieces re-orders the pair (coordinates of black piece, coordinates of white piece). - We need to trace if all possible permutations of their positions can be reached exactly once by the allowed moves. 2. **Total Positions Analysis**: - Label the coordinates of the black piece as (x_1, y_1) and the white piece as (x_2, y_2). Initially, these coordinates are distinct. - The chessboard has 64 squares, but since the two pieces cannot occupy the same square, the number of valid distinct arrangements is 64 times 63 = 4032. 3. **Possible Moves**: - Each move transforms one piece's coordinates by 1 unit (either horizontal or vertical). - Any allowed move does not increase or decrease the total number of valid distinct positions in an intermediate step. 4. **Permutation and Cycle Argument**: - Given 4032 distinct ordered pairs (x_1, y_1; x_2, y_2). - The problem requires checking if it is possible to create a sequence of moves (m_1, m_2, ldots, m_{4032}) such that each unique pair appears exactly once. 5. **Graph Theoretical Representation**: - Represent the chessboard and the valid moves as a graph: - Each node represents an arrangement of two pieces. - Each edge represents a possible move (transformation) from one arrangement to another. - The task is now to check if the graph is Eulerian, meaning every potential position (node) can be visited exactly once. 6. **Degree Condition Check**: - For an Eulerian path or cycle, each node (arrangement) must: - Have an even degree, or - All but exactly two nodes have even degrees (allowing for a path but not a cycle). - Verify the move constraints maintain or violate the Eulerian conditions. 7. **Conclusion (Contradiction Revealed)**: - Under typical non-restricted movement, each position change does not necessarily maintain the even degree condition, leading to an imbalance in degree properties. - There can arise positions where the degree condition imposes infeasibility due to limited move options or boundaries. Hence, based on the contradiction in the step with degree validation, it is revealed that it is not feasible to traverse all positions exactly once using the allowed moves (as it won't form a perfect Eulerian circuit or path under simple degree conditions). Finally, we conclude that the pieces cannot encounter all possible pairs exactly once: boxed{text{No, it is not possible.}}"},{"prompt":"Carla needs to drive her car to do a bunch of errands.

Let alpha = angle ABC be the angle between the first stick AB and the second stick BC, and beta = angle BCD be the angle between the second stick BC and the third stick CD. 2. **Range of Angles:** Since these angles can vary based on the random placement of the sticks, we can assume that 0 leq alpha leq pi (since alpha is between two lines lying on the same plane) and 0 leq beta leq 2pi (since beta can complete a full circle). 3. **Elementary Outcomes:** The elementary outcomes are pairs (alpha, beta), which means that every possible combination of these angles (alpha, beta) covers a rectangular region on the alpha O beta plane.

For example, consider P D C E. In any cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary. - Let angle DPE and angle DCE denote the angles at vertices P and C respectively. - Since P D C E is cyclic, angle DPE + angle DCE = 180^circ. 3. **Using Power of a Point**: By the power of a point theorem, we have the relationship: [ AF cdot AB = AP cdot AD = AE cdot AC ] From the above relationship, it follows that: [ frac{AF}{AE} = frac{AC}{AB} ] 4. **Proving Cyclicity in BFEC**: Consequently, quadrilateral BFEC is also cyclic because the lengths of segments meet the criteria established by cyclic quadrilaterals. 5. **Angles in Cyclic Quadrilateral**: We can compute the angles from the cyclic condition: [ angle AEP = angle AFP = angle BFC = angle BEC = angle PEA ] This implies: [ overline{BPE} perp overline{AC}, quad overline{CPF} perp overline{AB}, quad text{and} quad overline{APD} perp overline{BC} ] 6. **Proving Orthocenter**: Since P is where each perpendicular from a vertex (to the opposite side) intersects and aligns with the cyclic nature of the quadrilaterals, P acts as the orthocenter of triangle ABC. 7. **Proving Incircle and Equal Segment Lengths**: Now consider quadrilateral P D C E, which has an incircle and satisfies the conditions: [ PD + CE = PE + CD ] Using this and the equality from the cyclic property, we combine: [ PD = PE quad text{and} quad CD = CE ] Thus, P D C E forms a kite, establishing PD = PE = PF. 8. **Center and Incenter**: Since P is equidistant from D, E, and F, we determine that P operates as the incenter of triangle ABC. 9. **Equilateral Conclusion**: Being both the orthocenter and incenter of a triangle typically implies the triangle is equilateral.

To verify this, we substitute (a = frac{1}{2}) into the operation formula: [ 2 left(frac{1}{2}right) b - left(frac{1}{2}right) - b + 1 = b - frac{1}{2} - b + 1 = frac{1}{2} ] This shows that if one of the numbers is (frac{1}{2}), the result of the operation will always be (frac{1}{2}). 4. **Inductive Argument**: We can use induction to show that (frac{1}{2}) will always be present on the blackboard after each operation: - Initially, (frac{1008}{2016} = frac{1}{2}) is on the blackboard. - Suppose after (k) operations, (frac{1}{2}) is still on the blackboard. - In the ((k+1))-th operation, we can always choose (frac{1}{2}) and any other number (b).

The cases (m = 1) and (m = 2) can be handled separately and are straightforward. - From every unoccupied cell not on the border of the board, we emit four lasers from the center of the cell, one in each of the four directions. These must each hit the edge of a domino immediately. Cells on the border emit two or three lasers only, according to whether or not they are on the corner. 2. **Claim: Every domino in the grid is hit by at most four lasers; this bound improves to three if the domino is on the border of the grid.** - **Proof:** Each edge of the domino is hit by at most one laser.

We consider two different possibilities for the layout of the two dominoes touching (A). - **First Case:** - The dominoes point the same way, say vertically. - Consider the cell marked (1); it must be vacant (since either a horizontal or vertical domino would violate the equality case condition). - The cell immediately below (1) must be occupied, and again we see the domino should be vertical. - This means the cells marked (2), (3), (4) must be vacant, and we get a vertical domino touching all three. - This process repeats, showing all dominoes in the first three columns are vertical.

First, take the derivative of f(x) to find the critical points: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(e^x - 2x + a) = e^x - 2. Setting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical point(s): f'(x) = 0 Rightarrow e^x - 2 = 0 Rightarrow e^x = 2 Rightarrow x = ln(2). Next, analyze the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing: - For x < ln(2), we have f'(x) < 0, which means that the function is decreasing on the interval (-infty, ln(2)). - For x > ln(2), we have f'(x) > 0, indicating that the function is increasing on the interval (ln(2), +infty). Therefore, the function y = f(x) attains a local minimum at x = ln(2). Let's compute this minimum value: f(ln(2)) = e^{ln(2)} - 2ln(2) + a = 2 - 2ln(2) + a. This local minimum is also the global minimum since f(x) is decreasing before x = ln(2) and increasing afterward. For f(x) to have a zero, the minimum value of the function must be less than or equal to zero: 2 - 2ln(2) + a leq 0. Solving the inequality for a: a leq 2ln(2) - 2.

Three nails were driven into the floor (one close to each side of the triangle) such that the triangle cannot be rotated without lifting it off the floor. The first nail divides side ( AB ) in the ratio ( 1:3 ) starting from vertex ( A ), the second nail divides side ( BC ) in the ratio ( 2:1 ) starting from vertex ( B ). In what ratio does the third nail divide side ( AC )?","completion":"1. **Determining the significance of a single nail:** First, let's analyze the situation with a single nail. Assume a single nail is driven into point ( M ) on the side ( AC ) of the equilateral triangle ( triangle ABC ). By placing this nail, we limit the triangle's ability to rotate in certain directions. To understand this, let's draw a perpendicular line from ( M ) to ( AC ). This perpendicular line will divide the plane into two half-planes, each influencing the possible rotation directions: ![Rис. 97](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_6455f48598646f41a890g-226.jpg?height=325&width=337&top_left_y=1307&top_left_x=130) If the supposed center of rotation ( O ) lies in the same half-plane as ( C ), the triangle can rotate counterclockwise around ( O ), and if it lies in the other half-plane, the triangle can rotate clockwise around ( O ). However, this analysis remains true provided ( O ) lies on the perpendicular line. 2. **Analyzing the case of three nails:** Now, let's introduce three nails. Designate their positions as follows: - The first nail is positioned at ( D ) on ( AB ) dividing it in the ratio ( 1:3 ) from ( A ). - The second nail is positioned at ( E ) on ( BC ) dividing it in the ratio ( 2:1 ) from ( B ). - The third nail will be at ( F ) on ( AC ). We need to determine the appropriate position for ( F ) so that the perpendiculars from the nails intersect at a single point. This arrangement requires considering that, for the triangle to be non-rotational, the perpendiculars from the positions ( D ), ( E ), and ( F ) must intersect precisely at one point. 3. **Construct the necessary perpendiculars:** Denote the required perpendiculars: - Draw perpendicular from ( D ) on ( AB ) to intersect ( AC ) at point ( K ). - Draw perpendicular from ( E ) on ( BC ) to intersect ( AC ) at point ( H ). At this juncture, consider the following lengths: [ AK = frac{AD}{cos 60^circ} = frac{AD}{0.5} = 2 cdot AD = frac{AC}{2} ] since ( AD ) is one-fourth of ( AB ), and hence: [ AD = frac{1}{4} AB = frac{1}{4} AC ] (as ( triangle ABC ) is equilateral). Similarly, for ( CH ), [ CH = frac{CE}{cos 60^circ} = frac{2}{3} AC ] since ( CE ) is two-thirds of ( BC ), and hence, [ CE = frac{2}{3} BC = frac{2}{3} AC ] considering equilateral sides. 4. **Analyzing intersection points:** To ensure the intersection of perpendiculars at a single point ( R ), the layout should be such that the formed regions are symmetrical. Consequently, the relative measurements infer the remaining segment split by the final perpendicular must reflect the equidistant intersection criterion. Here's what this implies in geometric terms: ( H ) and ( K ) form conjugate triangles, [ HFK = KHR ] considering the observed criteria for imposed equilateral symmetrical intersections by perpendiculars. Upon evaluating: [ HF = FK ] This means ( F ) must be located such that: [ F text{ divides } AC text{ in the ratio } 5:7 text{ (from } A text{).} ] Therefore, the third nail splits ( AC ) in the ratio ( 5:7 ) starting from vertex ( A ): boxed{frac{5}{12}: frac{7}{12}}"},{"prompt":"Given the sequence {a_n}, which satisfies a_1=1 and a_n=2a_{n1} (for ngeq 2, ninmathbb{N}), find the sum of the first six terms S_6.","completion":"From the given conditions, we have: frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}} = -2.

This can be calculated as: (x/100) * 4 = 0.04x litres of alcohol When these two quantities are mixed, the total volume of the mixture is 4 + 4 = 8 litres, and the total amount of alcohol is 2.5 + 0.04x litres. The problem states that the ratio of alcohol to water in the resulting mixture is 3. This means that for every 3 parts of alcohol, there is 1 part of water. Since the total parts in the mixture would be 3 parts alcohol + 1 part water = 4 parts, the fraction of the mixture that is alcohol is 3/4. So, the amount of alcohol in the 8-litre mixture should be 3/4 of the total volume: (3/4) * 8 = 6 litres of alcohol We can now set up an equation with the total alcohol from both vessels equal to the alcohol in the final mixture: 2.5 + 0.04x = 6 Now, let's solve for x: 0.04x = 6 - 2.5 0.04x = 3.5 x = 3.5 / 0.04 x = 350 / 4 x = 87.5 Therefore, the percentage of alcohol in vessel Q is boxed{87.5%} ."},{"prompt":"What digit B will make the number 476B divisible by 5?","completion":"A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5.

The original area of the rectangle is A = L * B. After the changes, the new length is L' = L * (1 + p), where p is the percentage increase in length expressed as a decimal. The new breadth is B' = B * (1 - 0.25) = B * 0.75, since the breadth is decreased by 25%. The new area A' is given by A' = L' * B' = L * (1 + p) * B * 0.75.

Prove that the complex number (frac{1}{2}(a+b+cbar{a} b c)) corresponds to the foot of the altitude dropped from vertex (a) to the side (bc).","completion":"To prove that the complex number (frac{1}{2}(a+b+c-bar{a}bc)) corresponds to the foot of the altitude dropped from the vertex (a) onto the side (bc) of the triangle, we will use the following two facts: 1. The orthocenter of the triangle (abc) is given by the point (a + b + c). This fact can be found, for instance, in advanced geometry problems involving complex numbers and triangles. 2. The point symmetric to the orthocenter with respect to any side of a triangle lies on the circumcircle of the triangle. This is another important property that is often discussed in the context of cyclic quadrilaterals and triangle geometry. Let's break down the proof step-by-step: 1. **Identify the point of intersection:** Let (z) be the point where the extension of the altitude from vertex (a) intersects the circumcircle of the triangle. Since (z) lies on the unit circle, it satisfies the property (z bar{z} = 1). 2. **Imaginary nature of the ratio:** Since (a), (b), and (c) lie on the unit circle, the number (frac{a-z}{b-c}) is purely imaginary. This is because the altitude from (a) to the side (bc) is perpendicular to (bc), and in complex number terms, this ratio turns out to be purely imaginary. 3. **Derive relationship using properties of the unit circle:** Consider the expression: [ frac{a-z}{b-c}=-left(frac{1}{a}-frac{1}{z}right) / left(frac{1}{b}-frac{1}{c}right)=-frac{a-z}{b-c} cdot frac{bc}{az} ] This arises from the property that if points lie on the unit circle, their inverse points (multiplicative inverses regarding their moduli) will have this symmetrical property. After simplifying the above, we obtain: [ z = -bar{a}bc ] Here, we use the property that multiplication of complex conjugate with unit modulus gives one, ( a cdot bar{a} = 1 ) since (a) lies on the unit circle. 4. **Identifying the desired point:** The sought point (x) must be the midpoint of the segment joining (z) and the orthocenter, which is (a + b + c). Therefore, [ x=frac{1}{2}(a+b+c+z) ] Given that (z = -bar{a}bc), we substitute this into the equation for (x): [ x = frac{1}{2}(a+b+c -bar{a}bc) ] # Conclusion Thus, we have shown that the complex number (frac{1}{2}(a+b+c - bar{a}bc)) indeed corresponds to the foot of the altitude dropped from the vertex (a) to the side (bc) of the triangle.

Pipe C empties the cistern in 12 hours, so its rate is -1/12 of the cistern per hour (negative because it's emptying the cistern). When all three pipes are open, the combined rate is the sum of the individual rates: Combined rate = Rate of A + Rate of B + Rate of C Combined rate = (1/8) + (1/16) - (1/12) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator.

We know that 15! is divisible by all integers up to 15, including 15 itself, which implies that for f(n) > 15, r must be greater than 14. This is because the factorial of any number less than or equal to 15 will contain 15 as a factor, and thus, will not satisfy the condition f(n) > 15. First, consider r=15, which gives us n = 15 times 15 = 225. However, since 15! is divisible by 225 (as it contains 15 cdot 5 cdot 3 as factors), this does not satisfy our condition. Therefore, we conclude that r > 15. Next, let's consider r=16, leading to n = 15 times 16 = 240. Similarly, 15! is divisible by 240 (since it contains 15 cdot 8 cdot 2 as factors), which means r > 16. Moving on to r=17, we find n = 15 times 17 = 255. At this point, it's crucial to note that the smallest integer k such that k! is divisible by 17 is k = 17 itself, because 17 is a prime number and does not divide the factorial of any number less than 17.

Prove that there exist four cities such that from any one of these cities you can both call and fly to any other using, if necessary, only the other two cities in the quartet as intermediate points.","completion":"To prove that there exist 4 cities in Schwambrania such that each city can communicate with the others either directly via phone or via flights using other cities in the same group as intermediaries, we will proceed by contradiction. 1. **Reformulate the Problem in Graph Theory Terms**: First, consider the map of Schwambrania as a graph where each city is represented by a vertex. Two vertices are connected by: - a solid line (an edge) if the cities are directly connected by a phone line. - a dashed line if they are connected directly by a flight. 2. **Properties of the Graph**: According to the problem's conditions: - Any two cities can either be connected directly by a solid line or a dashed line. - It is possible to travel from any city to another city by chaining phone calls or flights. - There is no single solid path or single dotted path pair that cannot connect all cities indirectly. 3. **Assumptions for Contradiction**: Assume that there does not exist a set of 4 cities such that each city in the set can both be connected directly and indirectly using only other cities in the same set. 4. **Choose Any Two Initial Cities**: Select any two cities, say (A_1) and (A_2), which are directly connected by a solid line: [ A_1 longleftrightarrow A_2 ] Since it must also be possible to connect (A_1) and (A_2) indirectly by dashed lines, there must be a shortest path of dashed lines between (A_1) and (A_2), say: [ A_1 longrightarrow A_3 longrightarrow A_3' longrightarrow ldots longrightarrow A_2 ] Select the shortest such path, which implies that any two non-neighbor cities in this path must be connected by a solid line. Otherwise, we could shorten the path by removing intermediary cities. 5. **Reduction of Path Length**: Consider if any city (A_k) breaks this rule by not having a solid connection to an end city. If (A_k) is indirectly connected via the path (A_3, A_3', ldots, A_k, ldots), then solid lines must connect adjoining nodes for shortest path omission. 6. **Set of 4 Cities**: From this path and the reasoning if applied in contradiction, we should form a subset of nodes such that solid and dashed line rules fold up to give a stable set. Adding neighbor (A_4) to the mix led the assumption stability: [ A_1 longleftrightarrow A_3 longleftrightarrow A_4 ] each city still completes dashed or direct stable trimmers within the subset thus: [ A_{1,2}, A_{3,4} quad cover both thus allowing the requisite communication as cities connect within constraints.] 7. **Conclusion**: This establishes the contradiction, solidly synthesized: there exists a set of 4 cities that fulfill the stated property.

Since there are four friends, the total amount they intended to contribute before the discount would be 4x dollars. Saren negotiated a 25% discount on the present.

Show that ( 5^{m} + 5^{n} ) can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if ( n ) and ( m ) have the same parity.","completion":"The problem asks to show that (5^m + 5^n) can be written as a sum of two squares if and only if (n) and (m) have the same parity. Step 1: Preliminaries First, recall that a number can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if in its prime factorization, all primes of the form (4k+3) appear with even exponents (by Fermat's Theorem on sums of two squares). Step 2: Considering Parity Let's consider two cases for the parity of (m) and (n): - Case 1: Both (m) and (n) are even. - Case 2: Both (m) and (n) are odd. - Case 3: (m) and (n) have different parity. # Case 1: (m) and (n) are both even If (m = 2a) and (n = 2b) for integers (a) and (b), then: [ 5^m + 5^n = 5^{2a} + 5^{2b} ] Both terms (5^{2a}) and (5^{2b}) can be written as (k^2) where (k) is an integer since (5^{2a}) is a perfect square and (5^{2b}) is also a perfect square. The sum of two perfect squares is a sum of two squares. Thus, (5^{2a} + 5^{2b}) is indeed a sum of two squares. # Case 2: (m) and (n) are both odd If (m = 2a+1) and (n=2b+1) for integers (a) and (b), then: [ 5^m + 5^n = 5^{2a+1} + 5^{2b+1} = 5 cdot 5^{2a} + 5 cdot 5^{2b} = 5 left(5^{2a} + 5^{2b}right) ] Using properties of sum of squares, the term inside the parenthesis (5^{2a} + 5^{2b}) as shown above, again, is already a sum of two squares. As both exponents involve only even numbers, the term itself is a sum of squares. And thus, multiplying by 5 doesn’t change the fundamental property that retains the content allowing a sum of squares, except multiplying by an integer 5: [ 5 left( k_1^2 + k_2^2 right) = 5 cdot k_1^2 + 5 cdot k_2^2 ] Because it retains a format to analyze as a result itself re-suming into composite forms like doubled results indicated. # Case 3: (m) and (n) have different parities In this case, either (m) is even and (n) is odd or (m) is odd and (n) is even. Say, without loss of generality, (m = 2a) (even) and (n = 2b+1) (odd): [ 5^m + 5^n = 5^{2a} + 5^{2b+1} = k_1^2 + 5 cdot k_2^2 ] Here, it won’t situate summing easily related to their factions as independent combining being one exactly twice such formations affecting odd-mixtures negatively consolidated in problem re-solving within non-square summing properties correlation directly: Thus, (ucosbar's mismatched property iterating provided conforming only sums without odd multiplicity affecting being non-fixative assured.

These points form a triangle, and we can draw ( binom{3}{2} = 3 ) distinct lines between every pair of points. Hence, there are exactly 3 distinct lines. Therefore, the statement holds true for ( n = 3 ). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume the statement holds for some ( n = k geq 3 ). This means that for any configuration of ( k ) non-collinear points, we can draw at least ( k ) distinct lines. 3. **Inductive Step**: Now consider ( n = k + 1 ). We have ( k + 1 ) non-collinear points. We need to show that there are at least ( k + 1 ) distinct lines. 4. **Using Sylvester's Theorem**: According to Sylvester’s theorem (Sylvester-Gallai theorem), if a finite set of points in a plane is not collinear, then there is at least one line which passes through exactly two of the points. Thus, among our ( k + 1 ) points, there exists a pair of points, say ( A_1 ) and ( A_{k+1} ), such that the line passing through them does not contain any other point from our set. 5. **Formation of Subsets**: Now consider the two subsets of points: - ( {A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k} ) - ( {A_2, A_3, ldots, A_{k+1}} ) At least one of these subsets must contain ( k ) non-collinear points.

Given that the remaining funds on each bank account are more than 10 rubles and every client in a specific group has the same amount of money entirely consisting of ones, we need to find the smallest number of clients in the group for which the total amount of money is also a number consisting entirely of ones. 2. The problem is equivalent to finding the smallest natural number ( m ) such that there exist natural numbers ( n ) and ( k ) where ( n > k > 1 ) and: [ underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{n} = underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{k} times m ] 3. This problem deals with repunit numbers, which are numbers consisting entirely of ones (e.g., 1, 11, 111, etc.). The smallest repunit that fits the conditions must be identified. 4. It is clear that ( m ) must be a number greater than 9 since the repunits we deal with are at least two digits. Assume ( m = overline{ab} ) where ( a geq 1 ). 5. Consider the equation: [ underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{n} = underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{k} times overline{ab} ] 6. If ( b = 1 ), then the second digit from the right in the product ( underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{k} times overline{ab} ) is ( a+1 ), which cannot be 1 if ( a geq 1 ). Hence, ( m geq 100 ). 7. Checking repunit multiplication, we find that for ( n = 100 ), this equation does not hold because: [ underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{k} times 100 = underbrace{111 ldots 11100}_{k} ] 8. With these insights, try ( n = 101 ) and ( k = 2 ): [ underbrace{111 ldots 1}_{101} = 11 times 101 ] This indeed results in 111 multiplied by 101 equaling 1111.

With 64 different letters, the number of one-letter words that could be formed is equal to the number of letters, which is 64. For two-letter words, each of the first and second positions can be filled with any of the 64 letters, so the number of two-letter words would be 64 * 64. However, since the seventh letter is now forbidden, we need to calculate the impact on both one-letter and two-letter words. For one-letter words, only one word is lost - the word that consists of the seventh letter itself. For two-letter words, we lose words in two scenarios: 1. When the seventh letter is in the first position, which would have allowed for 64 different second letters. 2.

We know that 4 men can color L meters of cloth in 2 days. This means that one man would take 4 times as long to color the same length of cloth, so one man would take 8 days to color L meters of cloth. Now, we are told that 5 men can color a 36-meter long cloth in 1.2 days. This means that one man would take 5 times as long to color the same length of cloth, so one man would take 6 days to color 36 meters of cloth. We can set up a proportion to find the length L that the first group colored, using the fact that the amount of work done (in this case, the length of cloth colored) is directly proportional to the number of men and the number of days they work. For the first group: Work done (W1) = Number of men (M1) * Number of days (D1) * Length of cloth (L1) W1 = 4 men * 2 days * L meters For the second group: Work done (W2) = Number of men (M2) * Number of days (D2) * Length of cloth (L2) W2 = 5 men * 1.2 days * 36 meters Since the amount of work done by one man in one day is a constant, we can equate the work done by both groups: 4 men * 2 days * L meters = 5 men * 1.2 days * 36 meters Now, we solve for L: 8L = 6 * 36 8L = 216 L = 216 / 8 L = 27 meters Therefore, the length of the cloth that the first group colored was boxed{27} meters."},{"prompt":"ain passes a train standing in platform in 30 sec and a man standing on the platform in 12 sec . if the speed of the train is 36 km / hr . what is the length of the platform ?","completion":"First, let's convert the speed of the moving train from km/hr to m/s because the lengths we are looking for will be in meters.

Since the train passes a man standing on the platform in 12 seconds, and it's moving at a speed of 10 m/s, the length of the train (L_train) can be calculated as: L_train = Speed * Time L_train = 10 m/s * 12 s L_train = 120 m The train takes 30 seconds to pass the entire platform, so the distance covered in 30 seconds is the length of the train plus the length of the platform (L_platform).

Note that ( f ) is a bijection from ( S ) to ( S ), as the composition of bijections is itself a bijection. 2. **Counting Orbits:** For each function ( f_i ), the set ( S ) is partitioned into disjoint orbits under ( f_i ).

The function ( f ) can be written as a product of its disjoint cycles, and each ( f_i ) similarly can be written in terms of its disjoint cycles. 4. **Relating Orbits to Transpositions:** The number of orbits can be related to the concept of transposition distance. Specifically, if a permutation is decomposed into cycles, the minimum number of transpositions needed to achieve that permutation from the identity permutation can be calculated. 5. **Orbit Counting Strategy:** - Each application of ( f_i ) can change the structure and number of orbits when composed with other permutations. - The function ( f = f_1 circ cdots circ f_k ) simplifies the overall permutation by merging cycles and potentially increasing the orbit count ( c(f) ). 6. **Bound Derivation:** - The value ( n - c(f_i) ) represents the deficit in the number of cycles. Since ( n ) elements can be grouped into several cycles, as permutations merge elements into cycles, transpositions occur. - Summing over all permutations, the cumulative deficit can be shown to at most increase by ( n ) each time a new permutation is composed. 7. **Formalizing the Bound:** Considering a permutation ( sigma ), the number of orbits ( c(sigma) ) is maximized for the identity permutation (which is ( n )). Each permutation ( f_i ) contributes to the formation of contiguous cycles. [ sum_{i=1}^{k} (n - c(f_i)) leq n(k-1) - (c(f) - 1)) ] This ensures: [ c(f_1) + c(f_2) + cdots + c(f_k) leq n(k - 1) + c(f) ] Therefore, we're able to simplify and confirm the statement through the properties of the composition and the orbit count of the resulting permutations.

Therefore, we conclude that: - When a > 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing in (-1,0) and monotonically decreasing in (0,+infty). - When a < 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing in (0,+infty) and monotonically decreasing in (-1,0).

Let h(t) = frac{e^t}{t} for t geq 1. The derivative of h(t) is {h'}(t) = frac{(t-1)e^t}{t^2}. Since (t-1)e^t geq 0 for t geq 1, h(t) is monotonically increasing for t geq 1. Therefore, h(t) geq h(1) = e for t geq 1. This implies a < frac{e^t}{t} for t geq 1, and since h(t) geq e, we have a < e. Thus, the range of real number a is (-infty, e).

Hence, the total number of games played is given by: [ 2 times frac{1}{2} times 6d times (6d - 1) = 6d(6d - 1) ] Here, the (frac{1}{2}) accounts for the fact that each game is counted twice when pairs are listed both ways. 5. In every game, one point is distributed among the players (either 1 point for a win or 0.5 points each for a draw). Therefore, the total number of points distributed is: [ 6d(6d - 1) ] 6. We are given that the boys scored twice as many points as the girls. The points scored by the boys would be (2x) and the points scored by the girls would be (x) such that: [ 2x + x = 6d(6d - 1) ] Hence, [ 3x = 6d(6d - 1) ] Leading to, [ x = 2d(6d - 1) ] 7. Each girl plays ( 2 times 5d = 10d ) games against boys, scoring a maximum of 10d points if she wins all those games. Additionally, the points scored in matches between the girls themselves are: [ 2 times frac{1}{2} times d(d-1) = d(d-1) ] Therefore, the total points that the girls can score is: [ 10d + d(d-1) = 10d + d^2 - d = d^2 + 9d ] Given that this total should be equal to the points ( x = 2d(6d - 1) ): [ d^2 + 9d leq 2d(6d-1) ] Simplifying, [ d^2 + 9d leq 12d^2 - 2d ] Rearranging terms, we get: [ 0 leq 11d^2 - 11d ] [ 0 leq 11d(d - 1) ] 8. Hence, ( d leq 1 ), meaning ( d ) can only be 1 (since ( d = 0 ) would imply no girls are present, which contradicts the problem statement). 9. Thus, if ( d = 1 ), then we have: [ 6d = 6 text{ players} ] Verifying, with 6 players and each one playing with every other player twice, the total number of games is: [ 6 times 5 = 30 text{ games} ] Points tallied would be: [ 30 text{ points,} ] with the girl scoring 10 points (winning all matches against 5 boys) and the boys scoring the remaining 20 points among themselves. # Conclusion: [ boxed{6 text{ players}} ]"},{"prompt":"A circular spinner for a game has a radius of 12 cm.

As the process ends in only one pile, Fiona chooses 1 in the last step. On the other hand, Fiona can choose at most n-1 in the first step.

Since x+1 ne y+1, the resulting piles will be different. 5. **Counting the Number of Different Final Piles:** Finally, there are 2^{n-2} subsets of {1, 2, dots, n-1} with each subset containing 1.

Step 1: Symmetry and Setup Consider a circle with radius 1. 1. Due to the axial symmetry of both the circle and the square with respect to the tangent at the point of tangency, the line perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency is the axis of symmetry for both shapes (Figure 1). 2. The center of the circle O lies on this axis of symmetry. 3. Let A and B be two adjacent vertices of the square on the circle, such that the side AB is a chord of the circle. Let AB = 2d. 4. Let the distance from the center O to the side AB be x. Step 2: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem In the right triangle triangle OFB: 1.

He begins with the point ((0, 1)), then ((1, 0)), followed by ((2, -1)), and so on. - Sasha colors each point either white or black. 2. **First Phase:** - Andrey continues marking points in the pattern ((x, 1-x)) and ((x+1, -x)) for (x in mathbb{Z}_{ge 0}). - If Sasha uses the same color for all these points, then Andrey continues indefinitely, and Sasha never wins. - If Sasha changes colors at some point, say for ((x, 1-x)) and ((x+1, -x)), then we move to the second phase. 3. **Second Phase:** - Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume that ((0, 1)) is white and ((1, 0)) is black. - Andrey will now maintain a line of positive slope through the origin such that all white points are above it and all black points are below it. 4. **Maintaining the Line:** - Initially, let (vec{w} = langle 0, 1 rangle) and (vec{b} = langle 1, 0 rangle). - At each step, Andrey marks the point corresponding to the vector (vec{w} + vec{b}). - If Sasha colors this point black, redefine (vec{b}) to be this new point while keeping (vec{w}) the same. - If Sasha colors this point white, redefine (vec{w}) to be this new point while keeping (vec{b}) the same. - This ensures that there always exists a line of positive slope through the origin separating the white and black points. 5. **Conclusion:** - By following this strategy, Andrey ensures that Sasha can never win, as there will always be a line separating the white and black points. (blacksquare) # Part (b) 1. **Restriction to Integer Points:** - Andrey can only mark integer points on the Cartesian plane. 2. **Sasha's Strategy:** - Sasha can use a strategy based on the pigeonhole principle and the finite nature of integer points within any bounded region. 3. **Finite Configuration:** - Consider a sufficiently large bounded region of the plane. Within this region, there are only finitely many integer points. - Sasha can color these points in such a way that eventually, no line can separate all white points from all black points. 4. **Guaranteeing a Win:** - By carefully choosing colors, Sasha can force a situation where any new point marked by Andrey will violate the separation condition. - For example, if Andrey marks points in a dense enough region, Sasha can ensure that the points are colored in a way that no line can separate them. 5. **Conclusion:** - Given the restriction to integer points, Sasha can guarantee a win by exploiting the finite nature of the configuration and the pigeonhole principle.

We want to show that there exist some ( i ) and ( j ) such that the last digit of ( a_i + a_j ) matches the last digit of ( n ). 3. **Preliminary Observation:** - Consider the number ( n mod 10 ), which gives us the last digit of ( n ). For simpler notation, let's denote this last digit by ( n_{text{last}} ). - We need to find ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) such that ( (a_i + a_j) mod 10 = n_{text{last}} ). 4. **Necessary Condition:** - If ( a_i ) is the last digit of the number ( n - a_j ), then: [ (a_i + a_j) mod 10 = n_{text{last}} ] - Hence, it suffices to demonstrate that there exist such ( i ) and ( j ) so that this condition is met. 5. **Considering Uniqueness of Digits:** - Since ( a_1, ldots, a_7 ) are distinct digits, there are exactly 7 different values among them. - Similarly, ( n - a_1, ldots, n - a_7 ) will produce distinct last digits because subtracting a distinct digit from ( n ) still results in distinct residues modulo 10. However, we need to be cautious with only the last digits. 6. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:** - There are 10 possible last digits (0 through 9). - Given that both sets ( {a_i} ) and ( {n - a_i } ) each have 7 unique elements, and there are only 10 possibilities for their last digits, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least four overlapping (common) last digits in both sets. 7. **Conclusion Based on Overlap:** - Given this overlap, there must exist distinct ( a_i ) and ( a_j ) such that: [ (a_i + a_j) mod 10 = n_{text{last}} ] - Therefore, for any natural number ( n ), there will always be a pair of digits whose sum ends with the same digit as ( n ). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Suppose October of year N has five Wednesdays.

The term x^{m-1}y implies that m-1 must be the highest power of x, which is 4 in a fourth-degree polynomial. However, since it's a trinomial and considering the degrees of other terms, we adjust our understanding to match the given condition. The presence of y does not affect the degree in x. 2. The term x^{m-3} suggests another power of x, which is related to m. 3. The term -nx^{2}y^{m-3} introduces a complexity with both n and m affecting the degree. For the polynomial to remain a trinomial, and given it's fourth-degree in terms of x and y, certain conditions must be met. Given the polynomial must be fourth-degree, and considering the structure of the given polynomial, we deduce: - For x^{m-1}y to be part of a fourth-degree polynomial, and considering it's the term with potentially the highest degree in x, we initially might think m-1 = 4. However, the correct approach, considering the trinomial structure and the degrees of other terms, is to find a balance that satisfies the condition of being a fourth-degree polynomial in total, not just in individual terms. - The term -nx^{2}y^{m-3} must not contribute to increasing the degree of the polynomial beyond four, which implies n=0 to eliminate this term, ensuring the polynomial remains a trinomial. Thus, we solve for m with the understanding that the polynomial's degree in terms of x is influenced by the given terms: [ m-1 = 3 implies m = 4 ] And we have n=0 to maintain the trinomial structure without increasing the degree unnecessarily. Therefore, the values of m and n are: [ boxed{m = 4, n = 0} ] # Part 2: Rearranging the polynomial and its constant term Given the values of m and n found in part (1), we substitute m=4 and n=0 into the polynomial: [ -2 + x^{4-1}y + x^{4-3} - 0 cdot x^{2}y^{4-3} ] This simplifies to: [ -2 + x^{3}y + x^{1} ] Rearranging this polynomial in descending powers of x, we already have it in the correct form: [ x^{3}y + x - 2 ] The constant term in this polynomial, when arranged in descending powers of x, is -2.

Each of these sub-triangles, ( triangle AOB ), ( triangle BOC ), ( triangle COA ), should have areas that sum up to the total area of ( triangle ABC ). - Given that: [ S_{AOB} = 0.5, quad S_{BOC} = 0.5, quad S_{COA} = 0.5 implies S_{ABC} = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.5 ] - This confirms that each sub-triangle ( triangle AOB ), ( triangle BOC ), ( triangle COA ) has equal area, which is consistent with the area calculated using Pick’s Theorem. 5. **Conclusion using Median Intersection Property**: - Since the areas of sub-triangles formed by joining an interior lattice point with the vertices are equal, this point must be the centroid, which is the intersection point of the medians of the triangle. - The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, reinforcing that point ( O ) must be the centroid.

(Fill in the blanks with the corresponding numbers) ______.","completion":"To address the problem systematically, let's analyze each conclusion step by step: - For conclusion ①, we know that in the set of integers, -1 is indeed the largest negative integer because any other negative integer is less than -1. Therefore, conclusion ① is correct. - For conclusion ②, the statement |a+2022| refers to the absolute value of a+2022. By definition, the absolute value of any number is always non-negative, meaning |a+2022| geq 0. However, the question suggests that |a+2022| is always a positive number, which overlooks the case where a = -2022 and |a+2022| = 0. Therefore, conclusion ② is not correct because it does not account for the case where |a+2022| could be 0. - For conclusion ③, if a and b are opposite numbers, then one is the negative of the other, implying a = -b or b = -a. The product of two opposite numbers is always negative, a times b < 0, because multiplying a positive number by a negative number yields a negative result. The statement in the solution suggests ab leq 0, which is slightly inaccurate because the equality part (=0) would imply one of the numbers could be 0, which is not the case for opposite numbers (excluding 0 itself, as it does not have an opposite in the same sense). Therefore, conclusion ③'s correction in the solution is not entirely accurate, but the original statement that a times b < 0 is correct. - For conclusion ④, the statement is that if the absolute value of a number is equal to itself, then the number is not negative. This is true because the absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line, which is always a non-negative number. If the absolute value of a number equals the number itself, it means the number is either positive or 0, hence not negative. Therefore, conclusion ④ is correct. Summarizing the analysis: - Conclusion ① is correct. - Conclusion ② is not correct because it does not consider the case where |a+2022| = 0. - Conclusion ③ is correct as stated in the problem, but the solution's interpretation is slightly off. The correct interpretation is that a times b < 0 for opposite numbers. - Conclusion ④ is correct. Therefore, the correct conclusions according to the problem are ① and ④.

Since Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug and Ed had 45 marbles, Doug had 45 - 10 = 35 marbles. Doug lost 11 of his marbles, so after the loss, Doug had 35 - 11 = 24 marbles. Frank had 15 marbles more than Doug initially, so Frank had 35 + 15 = 50 marbles. Frank lost 7 of his marbles, so after the loss, Frank had 50 - 7 = 43 marbles. Now, let's find the combined number of marbles Doug and Frank had after their losses: 24 (Doug's marbles) + 43 (Frank's marbles) = 67 marbles. Finally, we'll determine how many more marbles Ed had than the combined marbles of Doug and Frank after their losses: 45 (Ed's marbles) - 67 (combined marbles of Doug and Frank) = -22 marbles. This means that Doug and Frank together had boxed{22} more marbles than Ed after their losses.

The effective rate at which the tank is being emptied when both pipes are open is the rate of the outlet pipe minus the rate of the inlet pipe.

This is because the transformation -1 + frac{2}{x+1} shifts the function down by 1 unit and the frac{2}{x+1} part indicates a reflection and scaling based on the point (-1, -1). Given this understanding, we need to find a function among the options that becomes an odd function, which means its symmetric center should be at the origin left(0,0right). To achieve this, we can shift the function fleft(xright) one unit to the right and one unit up. This corresponds to replacing x with x-1 (shifting to the right) and then adding 1 (shifting up): [ y = fleft(x-1right) + 1 ] This transformation effectively moves the symmetric center to left(0,0right), making the function odd because an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x), and having a symmetric center at the origin is a characteristic of odd functions.

That is, ( b^2 - 4ac < 0 ). 2. **Analysis**: - The condition ( a < 0 ) ensures that the parabola opens downwards. - From ( b^2 - 4ac < 0 ), it follows that there are no real roots for the quadratic equation, meaning it does not cross the x-axis and remains entirely negative or entirely positive depending on the coefficient ( a ). Given ( a < 0 ), the polynomial remains negative for all ( x ). 3. **Ensuring ( c < 0 )**: - Because the quadratic polynomial is negative for all values of ( x ), even at ( x = 0 ), ( c ) must be negative (since ( c ) is the value of the polynomial at ( x = 0 )). 4. **If ( b > 0 )**: - If ( b > 0 ), then (frac{b}{a}) must be negative because ( a < 0 ). - Additionally, since ( c < 0 ), (frac{c}{a}) will be positive. - Therefore, (frac{b}{a}) being negative and (frac{c}{a} + 1) positive (because (frac{c}{a}) overcomes ( -1)), it is immediately clear that the inequality (frac{b}{a} < frac{c}{a} + 1) holds. 5. **If ( b leq 0 )**: - We explore the situation where ( b leq 0 ). - We aim to show that ( b leq c + a ).

Suppose one kid has 1 coin and the other kid has 1 coin. The condition for interchange is that one of the kids must have at least half of all the coins, which is 1 coin in this case. Since both kids have 1 coin, an interchange can occur. After the interchange, the distribution of coins remains the same. Thus, the number of interchanges is 1, which is equal to ( n ). 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume that for ( n = k ), after the ( k )-th interchange, the number of coins each kid has is divisible by ( 2^k ). We need to show that for ( n = k+1 ), after the ( (k+1) )-th interchange, the number of coins each kid has is divisible by ( 2^{k+1} ). 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:** - Suppose after ( k ) interchanges, the number of coins each kid has is divisible by ( 2^k ). Let the total number of coins be ( 2^{k+1} ). Initially, one kid has ( 2^{k+1} - 1 ) coins and the other kid has 1 coin. 4. **First Interchange:** - The kid with ( 2^{k+1} - 1 ) coins gives ( 2^{k+1} - 1 ) coins to the other kid. After the first interchange, the distribution of coins is: [ left( 2^{k+1} - 1 - (2^{k+1} - 1), 1 + (2^{k+1} - 1) right) = (0, 2^{k+1}) ] - Now, the kid with 0 coins cannot give any coins, so the interchange stops. 5. **General Case:** - For any ( n ), the number of interchanges is limited by the fact that after each interchange, the number of coins each kid has is divisible by ( 2^k ). Therefore, the maximum number of interchanges is ( n ). 6. **Example for ( n = 3 ):** - Suppose we have ( 2^3 = 8 ) coins.

Let us consider a rectangular grid of size (4 times 10) (4 rows and 10 columns). 2. To satisfy the condition that each row and each column must have an odd number of crosses (X's), note that an odd number of crosses must be placed in each row and each column. 3.

Begin by noticing that each row must contain at most 3 crosses to ensure one cell is blank (thus keeping the count odd and avoiding 4 crosses). 4. Summing up crosses for rows: [ text{Maximum crosses in each row} = 3 ] [ text{Total crosses in 4 rows} = 4 times 3 = 12 ] 5.

The remaining letters still maintain a sequence that does not disruptively translate into the hanging condition being violated. - Due to the separation of occurrences of each letter by at least two other letters within the same commutator, removing one nail does not simplify the commutator completely; thus, it remains structurally intact. 4. **Removing Two Nails**: - Removing two nails, especially those that hold critical positions, causes the commutators to successively annul: [ left[a_{1} a_{2}, a_{3} a_{4}right] ] - Removing either (a_{1}) and (a_{2}), (a_{3}) and (a_{4}), or any combination of two can simplify a significant portion of the commutator to simplify into a sequence that does not support the painting anymore.

When A and B work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: ( frac{1}{10} + frac{1}{15} = frac{3}{30} + frac{2}{30} = frac{5}{30} = frac{1}{6} ) of the work per day. This means that together, A and B can finish the work in 6 days.

The ratio of A's work to B's work is ( frac{3}{5} : frac{2}{5} ), which simplifies to 3:2. Since A gets Rs. 1920 for doing ( frac{3}{5} ) of the work, we can set up a proportion to find the total wages (let's call it T): ( frac{3}{5} ) of T = Rs. 1920 ( T = frac{1920 times 5}{3} ) ( T = 640 times 5 ) ( T = Rs. 3200 ) Therefore, the total wages for the work is Rs. boxed{3200} ."},{"prompt":"is known about the continuous function ( f ) that: 1.

Let (x = frac{4(b-1)}{a}) and (y = frac{a}{b-1}), we then have: [ frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy} Rightarrow frac{ frac{4(b-1)}{a} + frac{a}{b-1} }{2} geq sqrt{ frac{4(b-1)}{a} cdot frac{a}{b-1} } Rightarrow frac{4(b-1)}{a} + frac{a}{b-1} geq 2 cdot sqrt{ frac{4(b-1)}{a} cdot frac{a}{b-1} } = 2 cdot 2 = 4] Adding 5 to both sides, we get: [5 + frac{4(b-1)}{a} + frac{a}{b-1} geq 5 + 4] For the equality to hold, we must have (x=y) which means: [frac{4(b-1)}{a} = frac{a}{b-1}] This occurs when both sides are equal. Solving for (a) and (b-1) in terms of (a+b=2), we find that equality is achieved when (a = b - 1), which is true when (a = 1) and (b = 1), respecting the conditions (a > 0) and (b > 1). Hence, the minimum value of (frac{4}{a} + frac{1}{b-1}) is (5 + 4 = 9).

What is the least possible number m?","completion":"Let's denote the number we are looking for as m. According to the problem, when m is divided by 5, the quotient is 8 more than the remainder when m is divided by 34. Let's denote the remainder when m is divided by 34 as r. Then, we can write the following equation: m = 34k + r (1) where k is the quotient when m is divided by 34. Now, when m is divided by 5, the quotient is r + 8. So we can write: m = 5(r + 8) (2) Now we have two equations for m. We can set them equal to each other: 34k + r = 5(r + 8) Expanding the right side, we get: 34k + r = 5r + 40 Now, let's solve for r: 34k = 4r + 40 Since r is the remainder when m is divided by 34, it must be less than 34. So, we can try different values of r from 0 to 33 and see which one satisfies the equation. Let's start with r = 0: 34k = 4(0) + 40 34k = 40 Since 34 does not divide 40 evenly, r cannot be 0. Let's try r = 1: 34k = 4(1) + 40 34k = 44 Again, 34 does not divide 44 evenly, so r cannot be 1. We continue this process until we find a value of r that makes 34k an integer. After trying different values, we find that when r = 26, the equation holds: 34k = 4(26) + 40 34k = 104 + 40 34k = 144 Now, 144 is divisible by 34, and the quotient is k = 144 / 34 = 4 (with a remainder of 4, but since we are looking for the least possible m, we take the quotient). So, we have found that r = 26 and k = 4 satisfy the equation. Now we can find m using equation (1): m = 34k + r m = 34(4) + 26 m = 136 + 26 m = 162 Therefore, the least possible number m is boxed{162} ."},{"prompt":"Mr. Zubir bought a pair of pants, a shirt, and a coat.

Find the probability that all 3 balls are blue.","completion":"1. **Define Events:** Let's define the events as: [ A_{1} = text{\\"the first ball is blue\\"}, quad A_{2} = text{\\"the second ball is blue\\"}, quad A_{3} = text{\\"the third ball is blue\\"} ] The event that all 3 balls are blue can be denoted as: [ A = A_{1}A_{2}A_{3} ] 2. **Apply Multiplication Rule for Conditional Probabilities:** The probability of event (A) occurring is given by: [ P(A) = P(A_{1}A_{2}A_{3}) = P(A_{1})P(A_{2} mid A_{1})P(A_{3} mid A_{1}A_{2}) ] 3. **Calculate Individual Probabilities:** - Probability that the first ball is blue: [ P(A_{1}) = frac{text{Number of blue balls}}{text{Total number of balls}} = frac{6}{14} ] - Given the first ball is blue, there are now 5 blue balls left out of 13 remaining balls: [ P(A_{2} mid A_{1}) = frac{5}{13} ] - Given the first two balls are blue, there are now 4 blue balls left out of 12 remaining balls: [ P(A_{3} mid A_{1}A_{2}) = frac{4}{12} ] 4. **Combine Probabilities:** Combining these probabilities gives: [ P(A) = P(A_{1})P(A_{2} mid A_{1})P(A_{3} mid A_{1}A_{2}) = frac{6}{14} cdot frac{5}{13} cdot frac{4}{12} ] 5. **Simplify the Expression:** Simplify the product step-by-step: [ P(A) = frac{6}{14} cdot frac{5}{13} cdot frac{4}{12} = frac{3}{7} cdot frac{5}{13} cdot frac{1}{3} = frac{5}{91} ] Thus, the probability that all 3 balls drawn are blue is: [ boxed{frac{5}{91}} ] **Alternative Direct Calculation:** 1. **Use Combinatorics:** - Total ways to choose 3 balls out of 14: [ C_{14}^{3} = frac{14!}{3!(14-3)!} = frac{14 cdot 13 cdot 12}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 364 ] - Total ways to choose 3 blue balls out of 6: [ C_{6}^{3} = frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = frac{6 cdot 5 cdot 4}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 20 ] 2. **Calculate Probability Using Combinations:** - Probability that all 3 balls are blue: [ P(A) = frac{C_{6}^{3}}{C_{14}^{3}} = frac{20}{364} = frac{5}{91} ] Thus, the probability calculated using combinatorics also confirms: [ boxed{frac{5}{91}} ]"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],N={key:0},z={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,o,s){const u=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",I,[(i(!0),a(w,null,y(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(i(),v(u,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
