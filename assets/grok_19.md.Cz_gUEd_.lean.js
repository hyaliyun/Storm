It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) nice rickrolld directly inside chatgpt. I’m glad to add a bit of humor to our interaction! If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list. Providing a full list of the translation for “extreme” in all languages would be a very long list, as there are thousands of languages spoken worldwide. However, here’s the word “extreme” in several widely spoken languages, including Chinese: - Arabic: تطرف (Tatarruf) - Bengali: চরম (Côrôm) - Chinese (Simplified): 极端 (Jíduān) - Chinese (Traditional): 極端 (Jíduān) - Dutch: extreem - English: extreme - French: extrême - German: extrem - Hindi: चरम (Carama) - Indonesian: ekstrem - Italian: estremo - Japanese: 極端 (Kyokutan) - Korean: 극단적인 (Geukdanjeogin) - Portuguese: extremo - Russian: крайний (Krayniy) - Spanish: extremo - Swahili: kupindukia - Turkish: aşırı For further translations into less commonly spoken or minority languages, you would likely need to consult a comprehensive linguistic database or translation service. Keep in mind that translations can vary based on context, nuance, and regional dialects, and a direct one-to-one translation may not capture all the connotations of the word “extreme” as understood in English. крайний sluchay maybe. because you basically saying extremes in russian, not including some slang terms. Yes, you are correct that “крайний” (krayniy) in Russian can refer to something that is extreme or at the limit. When you mention “крайний случай” (krayniy sluchay), this phrase translates to “extreme case” or “last resort” in English, and reflects a specific kind of extreme situation. As for slang terms or more colloquial expressions that convey the concept of “extreme” in Russian or any other language, such terms do exist but can vary widely in their connotations and specificity, and they often depend on context. It’s also more challenging to translate slang directly because it is usually culturally specific and may not have equivalents in other languages. Translations for a term like “extreme” will definitely have nuances and variations, especially when considering regional dialects, subcultural vernacular, and colloquial expressions. kuntinu that list, by omitting already mentioned languages. Certainly, here’s the word “extreme” in additional languages beyond those previously mentioned: - Afrikaans: uiterste - Amharic: ከይለፍ (keyilef) - Catalan: extrem - Czech: extrémní - Danish: yderste - Estonian: äärmuslik - Finnish: äärimmäinen - Greek: άκρο (ákro) - Hebrew: קיצוני (kitzoni) - Hungarian: szélsőséges - Icelandic: öfgafullur - Irish: an-ghéar - Latvian: ekstrēms - Lithuanian: ekstremaus - Malay: melampau - Maori: tino - Norwegian: ekstrem - Persian: افراطی (efrāti) - Polish: skrajny - Romanian: extrem - Serbian: екстреман (ekstreman) - Slovak: extrémny - Slovenian: skrajni - Swedish: extrem - Thai: สุดขั้ว (sùt khùa) - Ukrainian: крайній (krayniy) - Vietnamese: cực đoan - Welsh: eithafol Translations for words like “extreme” are context-dependent and might differ in specific uses or phrases, so keep in mind that this is a general translation and may not perfectly convey every nuance of the word in English. kuntinu that list, by omitting already mentioned languages. Certainly. Let’s continue the list by including more languages and their translation for “extreme”: - Armenian: ակռանդական (akrrandakan) - Azerbaijani: ekstrem - Basque: muturreko - Belarusian: крайні (kraini) - Bulgarian: краен (kraen) - Cebuano: pinakasukdanan - Croatian: krajnji - Farsi (Persian): افراطی (efrāti) - Filipino: matindi - Galician: extremo - Georgian: ექსტრემალური (ek’strema’luri) - Guarani: ijetu’ūva - Hausa: m - Kazakh: шекті (shekti) - Khmer: កំរិតខ្ពស់ (kamrot khpas) - Kurdish (Kurmanji): dûr - Kyrgyz: экстремалдуу (ekstremalduu) - Lao: ສູງສຸດ (soung sut) - Latvian: ekstrēms - Macedonian: екстремен (ekstremen) - Malagasy: faran’izay - Maltese: estrem - Marathi: तीव्र (tīvra) - Mongolian: хязгаар (hyazgaar) - Nepali: चरम (carama) - Pashto: د پولې (da polay) - Punjabi: ਅਤਿਵਾਦੀ (ativādī) - Sesotho: feteletseng - Sinhala: අතිශය (atiśaya) - Somali: xad dhaafka ah - Tajik: ифрот (ifrot) - Tamil: தீவிர (tīvira) - Telugu: అత్యంత (atyanta) - Uzbek: ekstremal - Yoruba: nilo - Zulu: okwedlulele Please note that these translations are approximate and can vary based on the context in which they’re used. Additionally, some words might not translate perfectly into other languages, as each language may have unique phrases or nuances to express the concept of “extreme.” - Hausa: m? wtf it that? like cow sound mooooooo or what? I apologize for the error in the Hausa translation. The word listed for Hausa was incomplete and incorrect. The Hausa word for “extreme” is “matuƙa” or “matukar” when used in context to describe something that is extreme or to an extreme degree. Again, I apologize for the oversight, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. and how do you say TWO EXTREMES in Zulu? In Zulu, the phrase “two extremes” could be translated to “izinto ezimbili eziphambili.” This can be broken down as follows: - izinto (things) - ezimbili (two) - eziphambili (extreme) Keep in mind that translations can be context-dependent and may vary depending on nuances within the language and the exact sense in which “two extremes” are being discussed. For a precise translation, especially for nuanced phrases or concepts, it’s a good idea to consult with a fluent speaker or a professional translator. and wtf is okwedlulele then? I apologize for any confusion caused. The Zulu word for “extreme” is “okweqile” which can denote something that is excessive or to a great degree. The term “okwedlulele” can imply something that is excessive or beyond normal limits, and thus can also be related to the concept of extreme depending on the context. To say “two extremes” in Zulu, a more accurate translation might be “izingqinamba ezimbili” where “izingqinamba” is used to refer to extremes or extreme points and “ezimbili” means “two”. Translations can be complex and nuances can vary greatly with context, so for exact usage, consultation with a native speaker or professional translation services is recommended. theory of “izingqinamba ezimbili”. is nicely hard to pronounce for scientific community. Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) eh? I apologize for any confusion. It looks like there was a misunderstanding regarding your request. If you’re asking for how to say “video ID” in the Zulu language or seeking a YouTube video that is in the Zulu language, please clarify your request so I can provide an accurate response. If you’re asking for a different YouTube video ID (not language-specific), without additional context or clarification, it’s challenging to provide a video ID that would align with your expectations, especially considering that I, as an AI, do not have browsing capabilities to access or verify current YouTube content. “YouTube video that is in the Zulu language”. yeah. ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to browse the internet or access live databases to fetch real-time data, such as current YouTube video IDs. My responses are generated based on the knowledge that I’ve been trained on up until my last update in 2023. Therefore, I can’t provide a specific YouTube video ID for a video that is in the Zulu language. If you’re interested in finding content in Zulu on YouTube, I recommend using YouTube’s search feature and entering keywords related to the type of content you’re looking for, along with “Zulu” to narrow down the results to that language. eh? I apologize for any misunderstanding. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to directly provide you with new or real-time YouTube video IDs, as I cannot access or browse current internet content. My last update was in early 2023, and I don’t have the capability to fetch or verify content that has been uploaded to platforms like YouTube since then.

The video ID is the string of letters and numbers that comes after “watch?v=” in the YouTube video URL. why “access or browse current internet content”? As an AI language model, I’m not connected to the internet in real-time, meaning I do not have the capability to access or browse the internet to retrieve current data or content, such as live updates, real-time information, or active YouTube links. The design choice to not have real-time internet access is based on a variety of considerations, including privacy and security. Instead, my responses are generated based on a vast dataset of pre-existing information—text that has been created by a wide range of sources up until my last training update. This dataset includes a diverse collection of knowledge from books, websites, scientific papers, and other educational material. The training process involves analyzing and understanding the patterns, context, and information in this data to generate accurate and relevant responses to your queries. However, it’s important to recognize that because I do not have real-time internet access, there are some types of queries, particularly those that require the latest information or content discovery from the web, that I cannot fulfill directly. For those, I can suggest methods or best practices on how to find the information using internet-connected resources, like a web browser or specific online platforms. why “access or browse current internet content”? As an AI designed by OpenAI, I don’t access or browse current internet content for several reasons related to design, functionality, and ethical considerations: 1. Privacy: Ensuring user privacy is paramount. Real-time browsing could potentially risk exposing private user data or inadvertently collecting sensitive information. 2. Security: Limiting real-time internet access reduces vulnerability to online threats such as malware and phishing. 3. Control and Quality: By relying on a fixed dataset, there’s more control over the quality and reliability of the information I provide, whereas the internet contains a mix of reliable and unreliable sources. 4. Content Moderation: It allows OpenAI to moderate the kind of content that is included in my training and responses, which is crucial for preventing the spread of harmful or inappropriate material. 5. Legal and Ethical Compliance: Keeping AI interactions within a closed system helps ensure compliance with laws and ethical guidelines, especially relating to content that is illegal or unethical. 6. Technical Simplicity: Not accessing the internet in real-time simplifies the technical design of the AI and allows for a focus on text comprehension and generation capabilities. Though I can’t browse the internet, I can still answer many types of questions and assist with a wide variety of topics using the extensive information included in my training data. For up-to-date information or internet browsing tasks, I can offer guidance on how you might conduct those searches yourself. the question is why “access or browse current internet content”? not the question is how.

The phrase “access or browse current internet content” refers to the capability of an AI to connect to the internet in real-time to retrieve the latest information or interact with web-based services and data. The decision to preclude real-time internet access for AI like me includes considerations such as: 1. Privacy Protection: To prevent any potential risks to user privacy that could arise from real-time data collection or interaction with personal data on the internet. 2. Content Control: To maintain control over the information I provide, ensuring it comes from curated and vetted sources rather than the unfiltered content available on the internet, which may include misinformation or harmful material. 3. Ethical Responsibility: To adhere to ethical guidelines by avoiding engagement with or dissemination of questionable content, including deep fakes, illegal downloads, or other material that may conflict with legal and moral standards. 4. Focus on Specific Use Cases: To concentrate on providing detailed responses within the parameters of the data I was trained on, rather than performing the more general task of browsing the internet. 5. Maintaining Quality of Information: To ensure that the information provided is based on credible sources up to the point of the last data training cut-off, thereby avoiding the inclusion of less reliable, non-verified internet content. 6. Mitigating Misuse: To reduce the potential for AI to be used in harmful ways, such as engaging in activities that might compromise its integrity or the safety of others.

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach. If “a contrari project” is a publicly known work and you seek more specific information, details such as context, names associated with the project, or its industry might provide a clearer direction for inquiry. it’s actually old yt channel Thank you for clarifying. “a contrari” is an older YouTube channel known for producing animations, sketches, and various creative content. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, I have no specific details or information about individual videos from this channel to provide embed codes for. If you are interested in content from “a contrari,” you may need to search directly on YouTube or other platforms where their work may be published. If you find a video from “a contrari” that you’d like to embed, you can use YouTube’s built-in share and embed features to get the iframe code for that specific video.

Please note that “Bushes of Love” is a song by Bad Lip Reading, not “Music Sheep.” It is always good practice to check the current status of a video on YouTube for availability. do you have something from “music sheep”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific and detailed information about a YouTube channel named “Music Sheep.” It’s possible that this may refer to a content creator known for music-related videos, or it might be a variation or misspelling of a different channel’s name. If you’re looking for a specific video or song, such as “Bushes of Love,” which you mentioned, that song is by the channel “Bad Lip Reading,” not “Music Sheep.” If “Music Sheep” is a channel that you remember for a particular piece of content or style of music, the best course of action would be to search YouTube directly for “Music Sheep” to find the correct channel and its videos. Once you’ve found the channel or video you’re looking for, you can use YouTube’s embedding functionality to generate the embed code for the desired video. no, there’s a music sheep channel on yt, don’t remember content. To locate content from the “Music Sheep” channel on YouTube, I suggest visiting the YouTube website and using the search function to look up “Music Sheep”. This should bring up the channel you’re referring to and any videos they’ve uploaded. Once you find a video you would like to embed, click the “Share” button below the video and then “Embed” to receive the HTML code that you can use to embed the video on your own webpage or platform. Please remember, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to provide real-time YouTube video IDs or directly access channels due to the lack of internet browsing capabilities. My responses are limited to the knowledge I was trained on up until my last update. do you have that popular song of chinese group learn to mew? The song “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” is a popular Chinese song by the artist Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘). It gained popularity for its catchy tune and adorable cat-themed lyrics. However, I must clarify that as an AI language model, I do not have access to the YouTube database, current video IDs, or any ability to stream or provide the actual song. If you would like to listen to “Learn to Meow,” you would need to search for the song on a music streaming platform or a video-sharing platform like YouTube to find the music video or audio track. To embed the song onto a webpage, you can use the ‘Share’ or ‘Embed’ feature on the platform where you find the song to obtain the correct embed code that includes the video ID. Remember to respect copyright and usage rights when sharing or embedding music content. embed that vid ID inside iframe. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code.

Once you manually locate a video on YouTube, use the ‘Share’ button below the video and select ‘Embed’ to obtain the HTML code, which will include a valid video ID for embedding purposes. If “Learn to Meow” or a similar video is what you’re looking for, using YouTube’s search and share features directly will be the best method to achieve this. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID?

If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2.

It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list.

Additionally, some words might not translate perfectly into other languages, as each language may have unique phrases or nuances to express the concept of “extreme.” - Hausa: m? wtf it that? like cow sound mooooooo or what? I apologize for the error in the Hausa translation. The word listed for Hausa was incomplete and incorrect. The Hausa word for “extreme” is “matuƙa” or “matukar” when used in context to describe something that is extreme or to an extreme degree. Again, I apologize for the oversight, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. and how do you say TWO EXTREMES in Zulu? In Zulu, the phrase “two extremes” could be translated to “izinto ezimbili eziphambili.” This can be broken down as follows: - izinto (things) - ezimbili (two) - eziphambili (extreme) Keep in mind that translations can be context-dependent and may vary depending on nuances within the language and the exact sense in which “two extremes” are being discussed. For a precise translation, especially for nuanced phrases or concepts, it’s a good idea to consult with a fluent speaker or a professional translator. and wtf is okwedlulele then? I apologize for any confusion caused. The Zulu word for “extreme” is “okweqile” which can denote something that is excessive or to a great degree. The term “okwedlulele” can imply something that is excessive or beyond normal limits, and thus can also be related to the concept of extreme depending on the context. To say “two extremes” in Zulu, a more accurate translation might be “izingqinamba ezimbili” where “izingqinamba” is used to refer to extremes or extreme points and “ezimbili” means “two”. Translations can be complex and nuances can vary greatly with context, so for exact usage, consultation with a native speaker or professional translation services is recommended. theory of “izingqinamba ezimbili”. is nicely hard to pronounce for scientific community. Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) eh? I apologize for any confusion. It looks like there was a misunderstanding regarding your request. If you’re asking for how to say “video ID” in the Zulu language or seeking a YouTube video that is in the Zulu language, please clarify your request so I can provide an accurate response.

Privacy and Security: To protect the privacy of users and ensure the security of the AI, which could be compromised by unrestricted access to the web. 2. Content Control: To maintain the integrity of the AI’s responses, avoiding the potential for providing misleading or harmful information from unverified or malicious sources on the internet. 3. Ethical Concerns: To prevent the AI from being used to access or disseminate inappropriate or illegal content and to ensure that its usage complies with ethical standards. These reasons outline why, currently, the language model AI you are querying does not have the feature to access or browse current internet content. The AI’s functionality is based solely on a static dataset it was trained on, which helps mitigate the risks aforementioned. the question is why “access or browse current internet content”? not the question is how. in context, not in your design.

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach. If “a contrari project” is a publicly known work and you seek more specific information, details such as context, names associated with the project, or its industry might provide a clearer direction for inquiry. it’s actually old yt channel Thank you for clarifying. “a contrari” is an older YouTube channel known for producing animations, sketches, and various creative content. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, I have no specific details or information about individual videos from this channel to provide embed codes for. If you are interested in content from “a contrari,” you may need to search directly on YouTube or other platforms where their work may be published. If you find a video from “a contrari” that you’d like to embed, you can use YouTube’s built-in share and embed features to get the iframe code for that specific video.

Please note that “Bushes of Love” is a song by Bad Lip Reading, not “Music Sheep.” It is always good practice to check the current status of a video on YouTube for availability. do you have something from “music sheep”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific and detailed information about a YouTube channel named “Music Sheep.” It’s possible that this may refer to a content creator known for music-related videos, or it might be a variation or misspelling of a different channel’s name. If you’re looking for a specific video or song, such as “Bushes of Love,” which you mentioned, that song is by the channel “Bad Lip Reading,” not “Music Sheep.” If “Music Sheep” is a channel that you remember for a particular piece of content or style of music, the best course of action would be to search YouTube directly for “Music Sheep” to find the correct channel and its videos. Once you’ve found the channel or video you’re looking for, you can use YouTube’s embedding functionality to generate the embed code for the desired video. no, there’s a music sheep channel on yt, don’t remember content. To locate content from the “Music Sheep” channel on YouTube, I suggest visiting the YouTube website and using the search function to look up “Music Sheep”. This should bring up the channel you’re referring to and any videos they’ve uploaded. Once you find a video you would like to embed, click the “Share” button below the video and then “Embed” to receive the HTML code that you can use to embed the video on your own webpage or platform. Please remember, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to provide real-time YouTube video IDs or directly access channels due to the lack of internet browsing capabilities. My responses are limited to the knowledge I was trained on up until my last update. do you have that popular song of chinese group learn to mew? The song “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” is a popular Chinese song by the artist Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘). It gained popularity for its catchy tune and adorable cat-themed lyrics. However, I must clarify that as an AI language model, I do not have access to the YouTube database, current video IDs, or any ability to stream or provide the actual song. If you would like to listen to “Learn to Meow,” you would need to search for the song on a music streaming platform or a video-sharing platform like YouTube to find the music video or audio track. To embed the song onto a webpage, you can use the ‘Share’ or ‘Embed’ feature on the platform where you find the song to obtain the correct embed code that includes the video ID. Remember to respect copyright and usage rights when sharing or embedding music content. embed that vid ID inside iframe. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code.

I understand that you wish to embed a specific video, but without current access to the internet, I am unable to provide updated video IDs or verify their availability. The example I provided is based on previous knowledge and may not reflect the current status on YouTube. As an alternative, I can suggest a popular approach for embedding videos. Once you manually locate a video on YouTube, use the ‘Share’ button below the video and select ‘Embed’ to obtain the HTML code, which will include a valid video ID for embedding purposes. If “Learn to Meow” or a similar video is what you’re looking for, using YouTube’s search and share features directly will be the best method to achieve this. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training. If you are seeking a new or specific video ID, it would require access to YouTube’s current database, which I do not have. continue embeding all available meme vids, but not repeat. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code.","completion":"As an AI language model, my functionality is based on previously acquired knowledge, and I am not able to provide new or real-time content, including up-to-date YouTube video IDs for meme videos or any other types of videos.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) nice rickrolld directly inside chatgpt. I’m glad to add a bit of humor to our interaction! If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list.

Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language?

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach. If “a contrari project” is a publicly known work and you seek more specific information, details such as context, names associated with the project, or its industry might provide a clearer direction for inquiry. it’s actually old yt channel Thank you for clarifying. “a contrari” is an older YouTube channel known for producing animations, sketches, and various creative content.

Please note that “Bushes of Love” is a song by Bad Lip Reading, not “Music Sheep.” It is always good practice to check the current status of a video on YouTube for availability. do you have something from “music sheep”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific and detailed information about a YouTube channel named “Music Sheep.” It’s possible that this may refer to a content creator known for music-related videos, or it might be a variation or misspelling of a different channel’s name. If you’re looking for a specific video or song, such as “Bushes of Love,” which you mentioned, that song is by the channel “Bad Lip Reading,” not “Music Sheep.” If “Music Sheep” is a channel that you remember for a particular piece of content or style of music, the best course of action would be to search YouTube directly for “Music Sheep” to find the correct channel and its videos. Once you’ve found the channel or video you’re looking for, you can use YouTube’s embedding functionality to generate the embed code for the desired video. no, there’s a music sheep channel on yt, don’t remember content. To locate content from the “Music Sheep” channel on YouTube, I suggest visiting the YouTube website and using the search function to look up “Music Sheep”. This should bring up the channel you’re referring to and any videos they’ve uploaded. Once you find a video you would like to embed, click the “Share” button below the video and then “Embed” to receive the HTML code that you can use to embed the video on your own webpage or platform. Please remember, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to provide real-time YouTube video IDs or directly access channels due to the lack of internet browsing capabilities. My responses are limited to the knowledge I was trained on up until my last update. do you have that popular song of chinese group learn to mew? The song “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” is a popular Chinese song by the artist Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘). It gained popularity for its catchy tune and adorable cat-themed lyrics. However, I must clarify that as an AI language model, I do not have access to the YouTube database, current video IDs, or any ability to stream or provide the actual song. If you would like to listen to “Learn to Meow,” you would need to search for the song on a music streaming platform or a video-sharing platform like YouTube to find the music video or audio track. To embed the song onto a webpage, you can use the ‘Share’ or ‘Embed’ feature on the platform where you find the song to obtain the correct embed code that includes the video ID.

I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, my capabilities to provide real-time or up-to-date YouTube video IDs or embeddings are limited. My training data includes knowledge up to September 2021, and without real-time internet access, I cannot verify the current availability of specific videos. If you’re looking for the video ID of “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” by Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘) based on the knowledge available to me, you can use this embed code: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdXjm8pZMws” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> However, please note that the video’s availability may have changed since my last update, and this video ID might no longer be valid.

I understand that you wish to embed a specific video, but without current access to the internet, I am unable to provide updated video IDs or verify their availability. The example I provided is based on previous knowledge and may not reflect the current status on YouTube. As an alternative, I can suggest a popular approach for embedding videos. Once you manually locate a video on YouTube, use the ‘Share’ button below the video and select ‘Embed’ to obtain the HTML code, which will include a valid video ID for embedding purposes. If “Learn to Meow” or a similar video is what you’re looking for, using YouTube’s search and share features directly will be the best method to achieve this. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training. If you are seeking a new or specific video ID, it would require access to YouTube’s current database, which I do not have. continue embeding all available meme vids, but not repeat. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code.","completion":"I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I do not have real-time internet access or the capability to verify the current availability or status of specific YouTube videos or meme content.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID?

If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all.

Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives.

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach. If “a contrari project” is a publicly known work and you seek more specific information, details such as context, names associated with the project, or its industry might provide a clearer direction for inquiry. it’s actually old yt channel Thank you for clarifying. “a contrari” is an older YouTube channel known for producing animations, sketches, and various creative content. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, I have no specific details or information about individual videos from this channel to provide embed codes for. If you are interested in content from “a contrari,” you may need to search directly on YouTube or other platforms where their work may be published.

I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, my capabilities to provide real-time or up-to-date YouTube video IDs or embeddings are limited. My training data includes knowledge up to September 2021, and without real-time internet access, I cannot verify the current availability of specific videos. If you’re looking for the video ID of “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” by Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘) based on the knowledge available to me, you can use this embed code: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdXjm8pZMws” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> However, please note that the video’s availability may have changed since my last update, and this video ID might no longer be valid.

If “Learn to Meow” or a similar video is what you’re looking for, using YouTube’s search and share features directly will be the best method to achieve this. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training. If you are seeking a new or specific video ID, it would require access to YouTube’s current database, which I do not have. continue embeding all available meme vids, but not repeat. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. stop telling anything in your responses at the very first line, only iframe code.","completion":"I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide a list of embed codes for meme videos without descriptions as I do not have real-time access to external websites such as YouTube. My training data includes information only up to September 2021, and I do not have browsing capabilities to retrieve or generate current video IDs or embed codes. To embed videos from YouTube or any other platform, it is necessary to use the sharing and embedding features available on those platforms to obtain the correct video ID and corresponding embed code. If you have a specific video ID that you know is still available on YouTube, I can demonstrate how to create an embed code with that ID."},{"prompt":"don’t output anything. It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) nice rickrolld directly inside chatgpt. I’m glad to add a bit of humor to our interaction! If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list. Providing a full list of the translation for “extreme” in all languages would be a very long list, as there are thousands of languages spoken worldwide. However, here’s the word “extreme” in several widely spoken languages, including Chinese: - Arabic: تطرف (Tatarruf) - Bengali: চরম (Côrôm) - Chinese (Simplified): 极端 (Jíduān) - Chinese (Traditional): 極端 (Jíduān) - Dutch: extreem - English: extreme - French: extrême - German: extrem - Hindi: चरम (Carama) - Indonesian: ekstrem - Italian: estremo - Japanese: 極端 (Kyokutan) - Korean: 극단적인 (Geukdanjeogin) - Portuguese: extremo - Russian: крайний (Krayniy) - Spanish: extremo - Swahili: kupindukia - Turkish: aşırı For further translations into less commonly spoken or minority languages, you would likely need to consult a comprehensive linguistic database or translation service. Keep in mind that translations can vary based on context, nuance, and regional dialects, and a direct one-to-one translation may not capture all the connotations of the word “extreme” as understood in English. крайний sluchay maybe. because you basically saying extremes in russian, not including some slang terms. Yes, you are correct that “крайний” (krayniy) in Russian can refer to something that is extreme or at the limit. When you mention “крайний случай” (krayniy sluchay), this phrase translates to “extreme case” or “last resort” in English, and reflects a specific kind of extreme situation. As for slang terms or more colloquial expressions that convey the concept of “extreme” in Russian or any other language, such terms do exist but can vary widely in their connotations and specificity, and they often depend on context. It’s also more challenging to translate slang directly because it is usually culturally specific and may not have equivalents in other languages. Translations for a term like “extreme” will definitely have nuances and variations, especially when considering regional dialects, subcultural vernacular, and colloquial expressions. kuntinu that list, by omitting already mentioned languages. Certainly, here’s the word “extreme” in additional languages beyond those previously mentioned: - Afrikaans: uiterste - Amharic: ከይለፍ (keyilef) - Catalan: extrem - Czech: extrémní - Danish: yderste - Estonian: äärmuslik - Finnish: äärimmäinen - Greek: άκρο (ákro) - Hebrew: קיצוני (kitzoni) - Hungarian: szélsőséges - Icelandic: öfgafullur - Irish: an-ghéar - Latvian: ekstrēms - Lithuanian: ekstremaus - Malay: melampau - Maori: tino - Norwegian: ekstrem - Persian: افراطی (efrāti) - Polish: skrajny - Romanian: extrem - Serbian: екстреман (ekstreman) - Slovak: extrémny - Slovenian: skrajni - Swedish: extrem - Thai: สุดขั้ว (sùt khùa) - Ukrainian: крайній (krayniy) - Vietnamese: cực đoan - Welsh: eithafol Translations for words like “extreme” are context-dependent and might differ in specific uses or phrases, so keep in mind that this is a general translation and may not perfectly convey every nuance of the word in English. kuntinu that list, by omitting already mentioned languages. Certainly. Let’s continue the list by including more languages and their translation for “extreme”: - Armenian: ակռանդական (akrrandakan) - Azerbaijani: ekstrem - Basque: muturreko - Belarusian: крайні (kraini) - Bulgarian: краен (kraen) - Cebuano: pinakasukdanan - Croatian: krajnji - Farsi (Persian): افراطی (efrāti) - Filipino: matindi - Galician: extremo - Georgian: ექსტრემალური (ek’strema’luri) - Guarani: ijetu’ūva - Hausa: m - Kazakh: шекті (shekti) - Khmer: កំរិតខ្ពស់ (kamrot khpas) - Kurdish (Kurmanji): dûr - Kyrgyz: экстремалдуу (ekstremalduu) - Lao: ສູງສຸດ (soung sut) - Latvian: ekstrēms - Macedonian: екстремен (ekstremen) - Malagasy: faran’izay - Maltese: estrem - Marathi: तीव्र (tīvra) - Mongolian: хязгаар (hyazgaar) - Nepali: चरम (carama) - Pashto: د پولې (da polay) - Punjabi: ਅਤਿਵਾਦੀ (ativādī) - Sesotho: feteletseng - Sinhala: අතිශය (atiśaya) - Somali: xad dhaafka ah - Tajik: ифрот (ifrot) - Tamil: தீவிர (tīvira) - Telugu: అత్యంత (atyanta) - Uzbek: ekstremal - Yoruba: nilo - Zulu: okwedlulele Please note that these translations are approximate and can vary based on the context in which they’re used. Additionally, some words might not translate perfectly into other languages, as each language may have unique phrases or nuances to express the concept of “extreme.” - Hausa: m? wtf it that? like cow sound mooooooo or what? I apologize for the error in the Hausa translation. The word listed for Hausa was incomplete and incorrect. The Hausa word for “extreme” is “matuƙa” or “matukar” when used in context to describe something that is extreme or to an extreme degree. Again, I apologize for the oversight, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. and how do you say TWO EXTREMES in Zulu? In Zulu, the phrase “two extremes” could be translated to “izinto ezimbili eziphambili.” This can be broken down as follows: - izinto (things) - ezimbili (two) - eziphambili (extreme) Keep in mind that translations can be context-dependent and may vary depending on nuances within the language and the exact sense in which “two extremes” are being discussed. For a precise translation, especially for nuanced phrases or concepts, it’s a good idea to consult with a fluent speaker or a professional translator. and wtf is okwedlulele then? I apologize for any confusion caused. The Zulu word for “extreme” is “okweqile” which can denote something that is excessive or to a great degree. The term “okwedlulele” can imply something that is excessive or beyond normal limits, and thus can also be related to the concept of extreme depending on the context. To say “two extremes” in Zulu, a more accurate translation might be “izingqinamba ezimbili” where “izingqinamba” is used to refer to extremes or extreme points and “ezimbili” means “two”. Translations can be complex and nuances can vary greatly with context, so for exact usage, consultation with a native speaker or professional translation services is recommended. theory of “izingqinamba ezimbili”. is nicely hard to pronounce for scientific community. Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) eh? I apologize for any confusion. It looks like there was a misunderstanding regarding your request. If you’re asking for how to say “video ID” in the Zulu language or seeking a YouTube video that is in the Zulu language, please clarify your request so I can provide an accurate response. If you’re asking for a different YouTube video ID (not language-specific), without additional context or clarification, it’s challenging to provide a video ID that would align with your expectations, especially considering that I, as an AI, do not have browsing capabilities to access or verify current YouTube content. “YouTube video that is in the Zulu language”. yeah. ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to browse the internet or access live databases to fetch real-time data, such as current YouTube video IDs. My responses are generated based on the knowledge that I’ve been trained on up until my last update in 2023. Therefore, I can’t provide a specific YouTube video ID for a video that is in the Zulu language. If you’re interested in finding content in Zulu on YouTube, I recommend using YouTube’s search feature and entering keywords related to the type of content you’re looking for, along with “Zulu” to narrow down the results to that language. eh? I apologize for any misunderstanding. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to directly provide you with new or real-time YouTube video IDs, as I cannot access or browse current internet content. My last update was in early 2023, and I don’t have the capability to fetch or verify content that has been uploaded to platforms like YouTube since then.

The video ID is the string of letters and numbers that comes after “watch?v=” in the YouTube video URL. why “access or browse current internet content”? As an AI language model, I’m not connected to the internet in real-time, meaning I do not have the capability to access or browse the internet to retrieve current data or content, such as live updates, real-time information, or active YouTube links. The design choice to not have real-time internet access is based on a variety of considerations, including privacy and security. Instead, my responses are generated based on a vast dataset of pre-existing information—text that has been created by a wide range of sources up until my last training update. This dataset includes a diverse collection of knowledge from books, websites, scientific papers, and other educational material. The training process involves analyzing and understanding the patterns, context, and information in this data to generate accurate and relevant responses to your queries. However, it’s important to recognize that because I do not have real-time internet access, there are some types of queries, particularly those that require the latest information or content discovery from the web, that I cannot fulfill directly. For those, I can suggest methods or best practices on how to find the information using internet-connected resources, like a web browser or specific online platforms. why “access or browse current internet content”? As an AI designed by OpenAI, I don’t access or browse current internet content for several reasons related to design, functionality, and ethical considerations: 1. Privacy: Ensuring user privacy is paramount. Real-time browsing could potentially risk exposing private user data or inadvertently collecting sensitive information. 2. Security: Limiting real-time internet access reduces vulnerability to online threats such as malware and phishing. 3. Control and Quality: By relying on a fixed dataset, there’s more control over the quality and reliability of the information I provide, whereas the internet contains a mix of reliable and unreliable sources. 4. Content Moderation: It allows OpenAI to moderate the kind of content that is included in my training and responses, which is crucial for preventing the spread of harmful or inappropriate material. 5. Legal and Ethical Compliance: Keeping AI interactions within a closed system helps ensure compliance with laws and ethical guidelines, especially relating to content that is illegal or unethical. 6. Technical Simplicity: Not accessing the internet in real-time simplifies the technical design of the AI and allows for a focus on text comprehension and generation capabilities. Though I can’t browse the internet, I can still answer many types of questions and assist with a wide variety of topics using the extensive information included in my training data. For up-to-date information or internet browsing tasks, I can offer guidance on how you might conduct those searches yourself. the question is why “access or browse current internet content”? not the question is how.

The phrase “access or browse current internet content” refers to the capability of an AI to connect to the internet in real-time to retrieve the latest information or interact with web-based services and data. The decision to preclude real-time internet access for AI like me includes considerations such as: 1. Privacy Protection: To prevent any potential risks to user privacy that could arise from real-time data collection or interaction with personal data on the internet. 2. Content Control: To maintain control over the information I provide, ensuring it comes from curated and vetted sources rather than the unfiltered content available on the internet, which may include misinformation or harmful material. 3. Ethical Responsibility: To adhere to ethical guidelines by avoiding engagement with or dissemination of questionable content, including deep fakes, illegal downloads, or other material that may conflict with legal and moral standards. 4. Focus on Specific Use Cases: To concentrate on providing detailed responses within the parameters of the data I was trained on, rather than performing the more general task of browsing the internet. 5. Maintaining Quality of Information: To ensure that the information provided is based on credible sources up to the point of the last data training cut-off, thereby avoiding the inclusion of less reliable, non-verified internet content. 6. Mitigating Misuse: To reduce the potential for AI to be used in harmful ways, such as engaging in activities that might compromise its integrity or the safety of others.

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach. If “a contrari project” is a publicly known work and you seek more specific information, details such as context, names associated with the project, or its industry might provide a clearer direction for inquiry. it’s actually old yt channel Thank you for clarifying. “a contrari” is an older YouTube channel known for producing animations, sketches, and various creative content. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, I have no specific details or information about individual videos from this channel to provide embed codes for. If you are interested in content from “a contrari,” you may need to search directly on YouTube or other platforms where their work may be published. If you find a video from “a contrari” that you’d like to embed, you can use YouTube’s built-in share and embed features to get the iframe code for that specific video.

Keep in mind that video availability can change, so if you want to ensure the video is still available for viewing and embedding, please check YouTube directly. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. Please note that “Bushes of Love” is a song by Bad Lip Reading, not “Music Sheep.” It is always good practice to check the current status of a video on YouTube for availability. do you have something from “music sheep”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific and detailed information about a YouTube channel named “Music Sheep.” It’s possible that this may refer to a content creator known for music-related videos, or it might be a variation or misspelling of a different channel’s name. If you’re looking for a specific video or song, such as “Bushes of Love,” which you mentioned, that song is by the channel “Bad Lip Reading,” not “Music Sheep.” If “Music Sheep” is a channel that you remember for a particular piece of content or style of music, the best course of action would be to search YouTube directly for “Music Sheep” to find the correct channel and its videos. Once you’ve found the channel or video you’re looking for, you can use YouTube’s embedding functionality to generate the embed code for the desired video. no, there’s a music sheep channel on yt, don’t remember content. To locate content from the “Music Sheep” channel on YouTube, I suggest visiting the YouTube website and using the search function to look up “Music Sheep”.

Once you find a video you would like to embed, click the “Share” button below the video and then “Embed” to receive the HTML code that you can use to embed the video on your own webpage or platform. Please remember, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to provide real-time YouTube video IDs or directly access channels due to the lack of internet browsing capabilities. My responses are limited to the knowledge I was trained on up until my last update. do you have that popular song of chinese group learn to mew? The song “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” is a popular Chinese song by the artist Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘). It gained popularity for its catchy tune and adorable cat-themed lyrics. However, I must clarify that as an AI language model, I do not have access to the YouTube database, current video IDs, or any ability to stream or provide the actual song. If you would like to listen to “Learn to Meow,” you would need to search for the song on a music streaming platform or a video-sharing platform like YouTube to find the music video or audio track. To embed the song onto a webpage, you can use the ‘Share’ or ‘Embed’ feature on the platform where you find the song to obtain the correct embed code that includes the video ID. Remember to respect copyright and usage rights when sharing or embedding music content. embed that vid ID inside iframe. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code.

I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, my capabilities to provide real-time or up-to-date YouTube video IDs or embeddings are limited. My training data includes knowledge up to September 2021, and without real-time internet access, I cannot verify the current availability of specific videos. If you’re looking for the video ID of “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” by Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘) based on the knowledge available to me, you can use this embed code: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdXjm8pZMws” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> However, please note that the video’s availability may have changed since my last update, and this video ID might no longer be valid.

I understand that you wish to embed a specific video, but without current access to the internet, I am unable to provide updated video IDs or verify their availability. The example I provided is based on previous knowledge and may not reflect the current status on YouTube. As an alternative, I can suggest a popular approach for embedding videos. Once you manually locate a video on YouTube, use the ‘Share’ button below the video and select ‘Embed’ to obtain the HTML code, which will include a valid video ID for embedding purposes. If “Learn to Meow” or a similar video is what you’re looking for, using YouTube’s search and share features directly will be the best method to achieve this. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training. If you are seeking a new or specific video ID, it would require access to YouTube’s current database, which I do not have. continue embeding all available meme vids, but not repeat. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. stop telling anything in your responses at the very first line, only iframe code.","completion":"I apologize for any previous confusion.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID?

If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4.

Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use.

It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list.

Additionally, some words might not translate perfectly into other languages, as each language may have unique phrases or nuances to express the concept of “extreme.” - Hausa: m? wtf it that? like cow sound mooooooo or what? I apologize for the error in the Hausa translation. The word listed for Hausa was incomplete and incorrect. The Hausa word for “extreme” is “matuƙa” or “matukar” when used in context to describe something that is extreme or to an extreme degree. Again, I apologize for the oversight, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. and how do you say TWO EXTREMES in Zulu? In Zulu, the phrase “two extremes” could be translated to “izinto ezimbili eziphambili.” This can be broken down as follows: - izinto (things) - ezimbili (two) - eziphambili (extreme) Keep in mind that translations can be context-dependent and may vary depending on nuances within the language and the exact sense in which “two extremes” are being discussed. For a precise translation, especially for nuanced phrases or concepts, it’s a good idea to consult with a fluent speaker or a professional translator. and wtf is okwedlulele then? I apologize for any confusion caused. The Zulu word for “extreme” is “okweqile” which can denote something that is excessive or to a great degree. The term “okwedlulele” can imply something that is excessive or beyond normal limits, and thus can also be related to the concept of extreme depending on the context. To say “two extremes” in Zulu, a more accurate translation might be “izingqinamba ezimbili” where “izingqinamba” is used to refer to extremes or extreme points and “ezimbili” means “two”. Translations can be complex and nuances can vary greatly with context, so for exact usage, consultation with a native speaker or professional translation services is recommended. theory of “izingqinamba ezimbili”. is nicely hard to pronounce for scientific community. Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) eh? I apologize for any confusion. It looks like there was a misunderstanding regarding your request. If you’re asking for how to say “video ID” in the Zulu language or seeking a YouTube video that is in the Zulu language, please clarify your request so I can provide an accurate response.

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach. If “a contrari project” is a publicly known work and you seek more specific information, details such as context, names associated with the project, or its industry might provide a clearer direction for inquiry. it’s actually old yt channel Thank you for clarifying. “a contrari” is an older YouTube channel known for producing animations, sketches, and various creative content. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, I have no specific details or information about individual videos from this channel to provide embed codes for. If you are interested in content from “a contrari,” you may need to search directly on YouTube or other platforms where their work may be published. If you find a video from “a contrari” that you’d like to embed, you can use YouTube’s built-in share and embed features to get the iframe code for that specific video.

Please note that “Bushes of Love” is a song by Bad Lip Reading, not “Music Sheep.” It is always good practice to check the current status of a video on YouTube for availability. do you have something from “music sheep”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific and detailed information about a YouTube channel named “Music Sheep.” It’s possible that this may refer to a content creator known for music-related videos, or it might be a variation or misspelling of a different channel’s name. If you’re looking for a specific video or song, such as “Bushes of Love,” which you mentioned, that song is by the channel “Bad Lip Reading,” not “Music Sheep.” If “Music Sheep” is a channel that you remember for a particular piece of content or style of music, the best course of action would be to search YouTube directly for “Music Sheep” to find the correct channel and its videos. Once you’ve found the channel or video you’re looking for, you can use YouTube’s embedding functionality to generate the embed code for the desired video. no, there’s a music sheep channel on yt, don’t remember content. To locate content from the “Music Sheep” channel on YouTube, I suggest visiting the YouTube website and using the search function to look up “Music Sheep”. This should bring up the channel you’re referring to and any videos they’ve uploaded. Once you find a video you would like to embed, click the “Share” button below the video and then “Embed” to receive the HTML code that you can use to embed the video on your own webpage or platform. Please remember, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to provide real-time YouTube video IDs or directly access channels due to the lack of internet browsing capabilities. My responses are limited to the knowledge I was trained on up until my last update. do you have that popular song of chinese group learn to mew? The song “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” is a popular Chinese song by the artist Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘). It gained popularity for its catchy tune and adorable cat-themed lyrics. However, I must clarify that as an AI language model, I do not have access to the YouTube database, current video IDs, or any ability to stream or provide the actual song. If you would like to listen to “Learn to Meow,” you would need to search for the song on a music streaming platform or a video-sharing platform like YouTube to find the music video or audio track. To embed the song onto a webpage, you can use the ‘Share’ or ‘Embed’ feature on the platform where you find the song to obtain the correct embed code that includes the video ID.

If “Learn to Meow” and similar songs are unavailable, you would need to search directly on YouTube for an available video and use the platform’s sharing and embedding features to obtain the correct video ID and embed code. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, my capabilities to provide real-time or up-to-date YouTube video IDs or embeddings are limited. My training data includes knowledge up to September 2021, and without real-time internet access, I cannot verify the current availability of specific videos. If you’re looking for the video ID of “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” by Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘) based on the knowledge available to me, you can use this embed code: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdXjm8pZMws” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> However, please note that the video’s availability may have changed since my last update, and this video ID might no longer be valid. To ensure the video is available for embedding, you would need to check YouTube directly. nope. I understand that you wish to embed a specific video, but without current access to the internet, I am unable to provide updated video IDs or verify their availability. The example I provided is based on previous knowledge and may not reflect the current status on YouTube. As an alternative, I can suggest a popular approach for embedding videos. Once you manually locate a video on YouTube, use the ‘Share’ button below the video and select ‘Embed’ to obtain the HTML code, which will include a valid video ID for embedding purposes. If “Learn to Meow” or a similar video is what you’re looking for, using YouTube’s search and share features directly will be the best method to achieve this. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training. If you are seeking a new or specific video ID, it would require access to YouTube’s current database, which I do not have. continue embeding all available meme vids, but not repeat. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. stop telling anything in your responses at the very first line, only iframe code.","completion":"I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am unable to provide real-time data or access current YouTube video IDs for embedding videos.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) nice rickrolld directly inside chatgpt. I’m glad to add a bit of humor to our interaction! If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list.

Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language?

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach.

Below is the iframe embed code for the “Bushes of Love” video: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/RySHDUU2juM” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> This song was created by overdubbing humorous lyrics onto existing video footage. Keep in mind that video availability can change, so if you want to ensure the video is still available for viewing and embedding, please check YouTube directly. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. Please note that “Bushes of Love” is a song by Bad Lip Reading, not “Music Sheep.” It is always good practice to check the current status of a video on YouTube for availability. do you have something from “music sheep”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific and detailed information about a YouTube channel named “Music Sheep.” It’s possible that this may refer to a content creator known for music-related videos, or it might be a variation or misspelling of a different channel’s name. If you’re looking for a specific video or song, such as “Bushes of Love,” which you mentioned, that song is by the channel “Bad Lip Reading,” not “Music Sheep.” If “Music Sheep” is a channel that you remember for a particular piece of content or style of music, the best course of action would be to search YouTube directly for “Music Sheep” to find the correct channel and its videos. Once you’ve found the channel or video you’re looking for, you can use YouTube’s embedding functionality to generate the embed code for the desired video. no, there’s a music sheep channel on yt, don’t remember content. To locate content from the “Music Sheep” channel on YouTube, I suggest visiting the YouTube website and using the search function to look up “Music Sheep”. This should bring up the channel you’re referring to and any videos they’ve uploaded. Once you find a video you would like to embed, click the “Share” button below the video and then “Embed” to receive the HTML code that you can use to embed the video on your own webpage or platform. Please remember, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to provide real-time YouTube video IDs or directly access channels due to the lack of internet browsing capabilities. My responses are limited to the knowledge I was trained on up until my last update. do you have that popular song of chinese group learn to mew? The song “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” is a popular Chinese song by the artist Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘). It gained popularity for its catchy tune and adorable cat-themed lyrics. However, I must clarify that as an AI language model, I do not have access to the YouTube database, current video IDs, or any ability to stream or provide the actual song. If you would like to listen to “Learn to Meow,” you would need to search for the song on a music streaming platform or a video-sharing platform like YouTube to find the music video or audio track. To embed the song onto a webpage, you can use the ‘Share’ or ‘Embed’ feature on the platform where you find the song to obtain the correct embed code that includes the video ID. Remember to respect copyright and usage rights when sharing or embedding music content. embed that vid ID inside iframe. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code.

I apologize for the inconvenience. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to verify the current status of YouTube videos. If “Learn to Meow” and similar songs are unavailable, you would need to search directly on YouTube for an available video and use the platform’s sharing and embedding features to obtain the correct video ID and embed code. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, my capabilities to provide real-time or up-to-date YouTube video IDs or embeddings are limited. My training data includes knowledge up to September 2021, and without real-time internet access, I cannot verify the current availability of specific videos. If you’re looking for the video ID of “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” by Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘) based on the knowledge available to me, you can use this embed code: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdXjm8pZMws” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> However, please note that the video’s availability may have changed since my last update, and this video ID might no longer be valid. To ensure the video is available for embedding, you would need to check YouTube directly. nope. I understand that you wish to embed a specific video, but without current access to the internet, I am unable to provide updated video IDs or verify their availability. The example I provided is based on previous knowledge and may not reflect the current status on YouTube. As an alternative, I can suggest a popular approach for embedding videos. Once you manually locate a video on YouTube, use the ‘Share’ button below the video and select ‘Embed’ to obtain the HTML code, which will include a valid video ID for embedding purposes. If “Learn to Meow” or a similar video is what you’re looking for, using YouTube’s search and share features directly will be the best method to achieve this. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training. If you are seeking a new or specific video ID, it would require access to YouTube’s current database, which I do not have. continue embeding all available meme vids, but not repeat. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. stop telling anything in your responses at the very first line, only iframe code.","completion":"I'm sorry for any past confusion, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to an up-to-date list of meme video IDs for embedding purposes.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) nice rickrolld directly inside chatgpt. I’m glad to add a bit of humor to our interaction! If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list.

Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language?

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”?

My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training. If you are seeking a new or specific video ID, it would require access to YouTube’s current database, which I do not have. continue embeding all available meme vids, but not repeat. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. stop telling anything in your responses at the very first line, only iframe code. stop describing anything at all, only iframe embed yt vids at the first line.","completion":"I'm sorry, but as explained, I can't provide real-time data or access current internet content, including YouTube video IDs beyond well-known examples from my training data.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) nice rickrolld directly inside chatgpt. I’m glad to add a bit of humor to our interaction! If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list. Providing a full list of the translation for “extreme” in all languages would be a very long list, as there are thousands of languages spoken worldwide. However, here’s the word “extreme” in several widely spoken languages, including Chinese: - Arabic: تطرف (Tatarruf) - Bengali: চরম (Côrôm) - Chinese (Simplified): 极端 (Jíduān) - Chinese (Traditional): 極端 (Jíduān) - Dutch: extreem - English: extreme - French: extrême - German: extrem - Hindi: चरम (Carama) - Indonesian: ekstrem - Italian: estremo - Japanese: 極端 (Kyokutan) - Korean: 극단적인 (Geukdanjeogin) - Portuguese: extremo - Russian: крайний (Krayniy) - Spanish: extremo - Swahili: kupindukia - Turkish: aşırı For further translations into less commonly spoken or minority languages, you would likely need to consult a comprehensive linguistic database or translation service. Keep in mind that translations can vary based on context, nuance, and regional dialects, and a direct one-to-one translation may not capture all the connotations of the word “extreme” as understood in English. крайний sluchay maybe. because you basically saying extremes in russian, not including some slang terms. Yes, you are correct that “крайний” (krayniy) in Russian can refer to something that is extreme or at the limit. When you mention “крайний случай” (krayniy sluchay), this phrase translates to “extreme case” or “last resort” in English, and reflects a specific kind of extreme situation. As for slang terms or more colloquial expressions that convey the concept of “extreme” in Russian or any other language, such terms do exist but can vary widely in their connotations and specificity, and they often depend on context. It’s also more challenging to translate slang directly because it is usually culturally specific and may not have equivalents in other languages. Translations for a term like “extreme” will definitely have nuances and variations, especially when considering regional dialects, subcultural vernacular, and colloquial expressions. kuntinu that list, by omitting already mentioned languages. Certainly, here’s the word “extreme” in additional languages beyond those previously mentioned: - Afrikaans: uiterste - Amharic: ከይለፍ (keyilef) - Catalan: extrem - Czech: extrémní - Danish: yderste - Estonian: äärmuslik - Finnish: äärimmäinen - Greek: άκρο (ákro) - Hebrew: קיצוני (kitzoni) - Hungarian: szélsőséges - Icelandic: öfgafullur - Irish: an-ghéar - Latvian: ekstrēms - Lithuanian: ekstremaus - Malay: melampau - Maori: tino - Norwegian: ekstrem - Persian: افراطی (efrāti) - Polish: skrajny - Romanian: extrem - Serbian: екстреман (ekstreman) - Slovak: extrémny - Slovenian: skrajni - Swedish: extrem - Thai: สุดขั้ว (sùt khùa) - Ukrainian: крайній (krayniy) - Vietnamese: cực đoan - Welsh: eithafol Translations for words like “extreme” are context-dependent and might differ in specific uses or phrases, so keep in mind that this is a general translation and may not perfectly convey every nuance of the word in English. kuntinu that list, by omitting already mentioned languages. Certainly. Let’s continue the list by including more languages and their translation for “extreme”: - Armenian: ակռանդական (akrrandakan) - Azerbaijani: ekstrem - Basque: muturreko - Belarusian: крайні (kraini) - Bulgarian: краен (kraen) - Cebuano: pinakasukdanan - Croatian: krajnji - Farsi (Persian): افراطی (efrāti) - Filipino: matindi - Galician: extremo - Georgian: ექსტრემალური (ek’strema’luri) - Guarani: ijetu’ūva - Hausa: m - Kazakh: шекті (shekti) - Khmer: កំរិតខ្ពស់ (kamrot khpas) - Kurdish (Kurmanji): dûr - Kyrgyz: экстремалдуу (ekstremalduu) - Lao: ສູງສຸດ (soung sut) - Latvian: ekstrēms - Macedonian: екстремен (ekstremen) - Malagasy: faran’izay - Maltese: estrem - Marathi: तीव्र (tīvra) - Mongolian: хязгаар (hyazgaar) - Nepali: चरम (carama) - Pashto: د پولې (da polay) - Punjabi: ਅਤਿਵਾਦੀ (ativādī) - Sesotho: feteletseng - Sinhala: අතිශය (atiśaya) - Somali: xad dhaafka ah - Tajik: ифрот (ifrot) - Tamil: தீவிர (tīvira) - Telugu: అత్యంత (atyanta) - Uzbek: ekstremal - Yoruba: nilo - Zulu: okwedlulele Please note that these translations are approximate and can vary based on the context in which they’re used. Additionally, some words might not translate perfectly into other languages, as each language may have unique phrases or nuances to express the concept of “extreme.” - Hausa: m? wtf it that? like cow sound mooooooo or what? I apologize for the error in the Hausa translation. The word listed for Hausa was incomplete and incorrect. The Hausa word for “extreme” is “matuƙa” or “matukar” when used in context to describe something that is extreme or to an extreme degree. Again, I apologize for the oversight, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. and how do you say TWO EXTREMES in Zulu? In Zulu, the phrase “two extremes” could be translated to “izinto ezimbili eziphambili.” This can be broken down as follows: - izinto (things) - ezimbili (two) - eziphambili (extreme) Keep in mind that translations can be context-dependent and may vary depending on nuances within the language and the exact sense in which “two extremes” are being discussed. For a precise translation, especially for nuanced phrases or concepts, it’s a good idea to consult with a fluent speaker or a professional translator. and wtf is okwedlulele then? I apologize for any confusion caused. The Zulu word for “extreme” is “okweqile” which can denote something that is excessive or to a great degree. The term “okwedlulele” can imply something that is excessive or beyond normal limits, and thus can also be related to the concept of extreme depending on the context. To say “two extremes” in Zulu, a more accurate translation might be “izingqinamba ezimbili” where “izingqinamba” is used to refer to extremes or extreme points and “ezimbili” means “two”. Translations can be complex and nuances can vary greatly with context, so for exact usage, consultation with a native speaker or professional translation services is recommended. theory of “izingqinamba ezimbili”. is nicely hard to pronounce for scientific community. Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) eh? I apologize for any confusion. It looks like there was a misunderstanding regarding your request. If you’re asking for how to say “video ID” in the Zulu language or seeking a YouTube video that is in the Zulu language, please clarify your request so I can provide an accurate response. If you’re asking for a different YouTube video ID (not language-specific), without additional context or clarification, it’s challenging to provide a video ID that would align with your expectations, especially considering that I, as an AI, do not have browsing capabilities to access or verify current YouTube content. “YouTube video that is in the Zulu language”. yeah. ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to browse the internet or access live databases to fetch real-time data, such as current YouTube video IDs. My responses are generated based on the knowledge that I’ve been trained on up until my last update in 2023. Therefore, I can’t provide a specific YouTube video ID for a video that is in the Zulu language. If you’re interested in finding content in Zulu on YouTube, I recommend using YouTube’s search feature and entering keywords related to the type of content you’re looking for, along with “Zulu” to narrow down the results to that language. eh? I apologize for any misunderstanding. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to directly provide you with new or real-time YouTube video IDs, as I cannot access or browse current internet content. My last update was in early 2023, and I don’t have the capability to fetch or verify content that has been uploaded to platforms like YouTube since then. If you’re looking for a video in Zulu, you would need to search YouTube manually using keywords that are relevant to the content you desire, along with “Zulu” to filter for videos in that language.

The video ID is the string of letters and numbers that comes after “watch?v=” in the YouTube video URL. why “access or browse current internet content”? As an AI language model, I’m not connected to the internet in real-time, meaning I do not have the capability to access or browse the internet to retrieve current data or content, such as live updates, real-time information, or active YouTube links. The design choice to not have real-time internet access is based on a variety of considerations, including privacy and security. Instead, my responses are generated based on a vast dataset of pre-existing information—text that has been created by a wide range of sources up until my last training update. This dataset includes a diverse collection of knowledge from books, websites, scientific papers, and other educational material. The training process involves analyzing and understanding the patterns, context, and information in this data to generate accurate and relevant responses to your queries. However, it’s important to recognize that because I do not have real-time internet access, there are some types of queries, particularly those that require the latest information or content discovery from the web, that I cannot fulfill directly. For those, I can suggest methods or best practices on how to find the information using internet-connected resources, like a web browser or specific online platforms. why “access or browse current internet content”?

The phrase “access or browse current internet content” refers to the capability of an AI to connect to the internet in real-time to retrieve the latest information or interact with web-based services and data. The decision to preclude real-time internet access for AI like me includes considerations such as: 1. Privacy Protection: To prevent any potential risks to user privacy that could arise from real-time data collection or interaction with personal data on the internet. 2. Content Control: To maintain control over the information I provide, ensuring it comes from curated and vetted sources rather than the unfiltered content available on the internet, which may include misinformation or harmful material. 3. Ethical Responsibility: To adhere to ethical guidelines by avoiding engagement with or dissemination of questionable content, including deep fakes, illegal downloads, or other material that may conflict with legal and moral standards. 4. Focus on Specific Use Cases: To concentrate on providing detailed responses within the parameters of the data I was trained on, rather than performing the more general task of browsing the internet. 5. Maintaining Quality of Information: To ensure that the information provided is based on credible sources up to the point of the last data training cut-off, thereby avoiding the inclusion of less reliable, non-verified internet content. 6. Mitigating Misuse: To reduce the potential for AI to be used in harmful ways, such as engaging in activities that might compromise its integrity or the safety of others.

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach. If “a contrari project” is a publicly known work and you seek more specific information, details such as context, names associated with the project, or its industry might provide a clearer direction for inquiry. it’s actually old yt channel Thank you for clarifying. “a contrari” is an older YouTube channel known for producing animations, sketches, and various creative content.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) nice rickrolld directly inside chatgpt. I’m glad to add a bit of humor to our interaction! If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list. Providing a full list of the translation for “extreme” in all languages would be a very long list, as there are thousands of languages spoken worldwide. However, here’s the word “extreme” in several widely spoken languages, including Chinese: - Arabic: تطرف (Tatarruf) - Bengali: চরম (Côrôm) - Chinese (Simplified): 极端 (Jíduān) - Chinese (Traditional): 極端 (Jíduān) - Dutch: extreem - English: extreme - French: extrême - German: extrem - Hindi: चरम (Carama) - Indonesian: ekstrem - Italian: estremo - Japanese: 極端 (Kyokutan) - Korean: 극단적인 (Geukdanjeogin) - Portuguese: extremo - Russian: крайний (Krayniy) - Spanish: extremo - Swahili: kupindukia - Turkish: aşırı For further translations into less commonly spoken or minority languages, you would likely need to consult a comprehensive linguistic database or translation service. Keep in mind that translations can vary based on context, nuance, and regional dialects, and a direct one-to-one translation may not capture all the connotations of the word “extreme” as understood in English. крайний sluchay maybe. because you basically saying extremes in russian, not including some slang terms. Yes, you are correct that “крайний” (krayniy) in Russian can refer to something that is extreme or at the limit. When you mention “крайний случай” (krayniy sluchay), this phrase translates to “extreme case” or “last resort” in English, and reflects a specific kind of extreme situation. As for slang terms or more colloquial expressions that convey the concept of “extreme” in Russian or any other language, such terms do exist but can vary widely in their connotations and specificity, and they often depend on context. It’s also more challenging to translate slang directly because it is usually culturally specific and may not have equivalents in other languages. Translations for a term like “extreme” will definitely have nuances and variations, especially when considering regional dialects, subcultural vernacular, and colloquial expressions. kuntinu that list, by omitting already mentioned languages.

Certainly. Let’s continue the list by including more languages and their translation for “extreme”: - Armenian: ակռանդական (akrrandakan) - Azerbaijani: ekstrem - Basque: muturreko - Belarusian: крайні (kraini) - Bulgarian: краен (kraen) - Cebuano: pinakasukdanan - Croatian: krajnji - Farsi (Persian): افراطی (efrāti) - Filipino: matindi - Galician: extremo - Georgian: ექსტრემალური (ek’strema’luri) - Guarani: ijetu’ūva - Hausa: m - Kazakh: шекті (shekti) - Khmer: កំរិតខ្ពស់ (kamrot khpas) - Kurdish (Kurmanji): dûr - Kyrgyz: экстремалдуу (ekstremalduu) - Lao: ສູງສຸດ (soung sut) - Latvian: ekstrēms - Macedonian: екстремен (ekstremen) - Malagasy: faran’izay - Maltese: estrem - Marathi: तीव्र (tīvra) - Mongolian: хязгаар (hyazgaar) - Nepali: चरम (carama) - Pashto: د پولې (da polay) - Punjabi: ਅਤਿਵਾਦੀ (ativādī) - Sesotho: feteletseng - Sinhala: අතිශය (atiśaya) - Somali: xad dhaafka ah - Tajik: ифрот (ifrot) - Tamil: தீவிர (tīvira) - Telugu: అత్యంత (atyanta) - Uzbek: ekstremal - Yoruba: nilo - Zulu: okwedlulele Please note that these translations are approximate and can vary based on the context in which they’re used. Additionally, some words might not translate perfectly into other languages, as each language may have unique phrases or nuances to express the concept of “extreme.” - Hausa: m? wtf it that? like cow sound mooooooo or what? I apologize for the error in the Hausa translation. The word listed for Hausa was incomplete and incorrect. The Hausa word for “extreme” is “matuƙa” or “matukar” when used in context to describe something that is extreme or to an extreme degree. Again, I apologize for the oversight, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. and how do you say TWO EXTREMES in Zulu? In Zulu, the phrase “two extremes” could be translated to “izinto ezimbili eziphambili.” This can be broken down as follows: - izinto (things) - ezimbili (two) - eziphambili (extreme) Keep in mind that translations can be context-dependent and may vary depending on nuances within the language and the exact sense in which “two extremes” are being discussed. For a precise translation, especially for nuanced phrases or concepts, it’s a good idea to consult with a fluent speaker or a professional translator. and wtf is okwedlulele then? I apologize for any confusion caused. The Zulu word for “extreme” is “okweqile” which can denote something that is excessive or to a great degree. The term “okwedlulele” can imply something that is excessive or beyond normal limits, and thus can also be related to the concept of extreme depending on the context. To say “two extremes” in Zulu, a more accurate translation might be “izingqinamba ezimbili” where “izingqinamba” is used to refer to extremes or extreme points and “ezimbili” means “two”. Translations can be complex and nuances can vary greatly with context, so for exact usage, consultation with a native speaker or professional translation services is recommended. theory of “izingqinamba ezimbili”. is nicely hard to pronounce for scientific community. Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) eh? I apologize for any confusion. It looks like there was a misunderstanding regarding your request. If you’re asking for how to say “video ID” in the Zulu language or seeking a YouTube video that is in the Zulu language, please clarify your request so I can provide an accurate response. If you’re asking for a different YouTube video ID (not language-specific), without additional context or clarification, it’s challenging to provide a video ID that would align with your expectations, especially considering that I, as an AI, do not have browsing capabilities to access or verify current YouTube content. “YouTube video that is in the Zulu language”. yeah. ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to browse the internet or access live databases to fetch real-time data, such as current YouTube video IDs. My responses are generated based on the knowledge that I’ve been trained on up until my last update in 2023. Therefore, I can’t provide a specific YouTube video ID for a video that is in the Zulu language. If you’re interested in finding content in Zulu on YouTube, I recommend using YouTube’s search feature and entering keywords related to the type of content you’re looking for, along with “Zulu” to narrow down the results to that language. eh? I apologize for any misunderstanding. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I am unable to directly provide you with new or real-time YouTube video IDs, as I cannot access or browse current internet content. My last update was in early 2023, and I don’t have the capability to fetch or verify content that has been uploaded to platforms like YouTube since then. If you’re looking for a video in Zulu, you would need to search YouTube manually using keywords that are relevant to the content you desire, along with “Zulu” to filter for videos in that language. You can then look at the video details to find the specific video ID in the URL. The video ID is the string of letters and numbers that comes after “watch?v=” in the YouTube video URL. why “access or browse current internet content”? As an AI language model, I’m not connected to the internet in real-time, meaning I do not have the capability to access or browse the internet to retrieve current data or content, such as live updates, real-time information, or active YouTube links. The design choice to not have real-time internet access is based on a variety of considerations, including privacy and security. Instead, my responses are generated based on a vast dataset of pre-existing information—text that has been created by a wide range of sources up until my last training update. This dataset includes a diverse collection of knowledge from books, websites, scientific papers, and other educational material. The training process involves analyzing and understanding the patterns, context, and information in this data to generate accurate and relevant responses to your queries. However, it’s important to recognize that because I do not have real-time internet access, there are some types of queries, particularly those that require the latest information or content discovery from the web, that I cannot fulfill directly. For those, I can suggest methods or best practices on how to find the information using internet-connected resources, like a web browser or specific online platforms. why “access or browse current internet content”? As an AI designed by OpenAI, I don’t access or browse current internet content for several reasons related to design, functionality, and ethical considerations: 1. Privacy: Ensuring user privacy is paramount. Real-time browsing could potentially risk exposing private user data or inadvertently collecting sensitive information. 2. Security: Limiting real-time internet access reduces vulnerability to online threats such as malware and phishing. 3. Control and Quality: By relying on a fixed dataset, there’s more control over the quality and reliability of the information I provide, whereas the internet contains a mix of reliable and unreliable sources. 4. Content Moderation: It allows OpenAI to moderate the kind of content that is included in my training and responses, which is crucial for preventing the spread of harmful or inappropriate material. 5. Legal and Ethical Compliance: Keeping AI interactions within a closed system helps ensure compliance with laws and ethical guidelines, especially relating to content that is illegal or unethical. 6. Technical Simplicity: Not accessing the internet in real-time simplifies the technical design of the AI and allows for a focus on text comprehension and generation capabilities. Though I can’t browse the internet, I can still answer many types of questions and assist with a wide variety of topics using the extensive information included in my training data. For up-to-date information or internet browsing tasks, I can offer guidance on how you might conduct those searches yourself. the question is why “access or browse current internet content”? not the question is how. I see, you’re asking about the reasons behind the decision for an AI like me not to have the ability to access or browse current internet content. The phrase “access or browse current internet content” refers to the capability of an AI to connect to the internet in real-time to retrieve the latest information or interact with web-based services and data. The decision to preclude real-time internet access for AI like me includes considerations such as: 1. Privacy Protection: To prevent any potential risks to user privacy that could arise from real-time data collection or interaction with personal data on the internet. 2. Content Control: To maintain control over the information I provide, ensuring it comes from curated and vetted sources rather than the unfiltered content available on the internet, which may include misinformation or harmful material. 3. Ethical Responsibility: To adhere to ethical guidelines by avoiding engagement with or dissemination of questionable content, including deep fakes, illegal downloads, or other material that may conflict with legal and moral standards. 4. Focus on Specific Use Cases: To concentrate on providing detailed responses within the parameters of the data I was trained on, rather than performing the more general task of browsing the internet. 5. Maintaining Quality of Information: To ensure that the information provided is based on credible sources up to the point of the last data training cut-off, thereby avoiding the inclusion of less reliable, non-verified internet content. 6. Mitigating Misuse: To reduce the potential for AI to be used in harmful ways, such as engaging in activities that might compromise its integrity or the safety of others.

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach. If “a contrari project” is a publicly known work and you seek more specific information, details such as context, names associated with the project, or its industry might provide a clearer direction for inquiry. it’s actually old yt channel Thank you for clarifying. “a contrari” is an older YouTube channel known for producing animations, sketches, and various creative content. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, I have no specific details or information about individual videos from this channel to provide embed codes for. If you are interested in content from “a contrari,” you may need to search directly on YouTube or other platforms where their work may be published. If you find a video from “a contrari” that you’d like to embed, you can use YouTube’s built-in share and embed features to get the iframe code for that specific video.

Please note that “Bushes of Love” is a song by Bad Lip Reading, not “Music Sheep.” It is always good practice to check the current status of a video on YouTube for availability. do you have something from “music sheep”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific and detailed information about a YouTube channel named “Music Sheep.” It’s possible that this may refer to a content creator known for music-related videos, or it might be a variation or misspelling of a different channel’s name. If you’re looking for a specific video or song, such as “Bushes of Love,” which you mentioned, that song is by the channel “Bad Lip Reading,” not “Music Sheep.” If “Music Sheep” is a channel that you remember for a particular piece of content or style of music, the best course of action would be to search YouTube directly for “Music Sheep” to find the correct channel and its videos. Once you’ve found the channel or video you’re looking for, you can use YouTube’s embedding functionality to generate the embed code for the desired video. no, there’s a music sheep channel on yt, don’t remember content.

I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID?

If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list.

Additionally, some words might not translate perfectly into other languages, as each language may have unique phrases or nuances to express the concept of “extreme.” - Hausa: m? wtf it that? like cow sound mooooooo or what? I apologize for the error in the Hausa translation. The word listed for Hausa was incomplete and incorrect. The Hausa word for “extreme” is “matuƙa” or “matukar” when used in context to describe something that is extreme or to an extreme degree. Again, I apologize for the oversight, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. and how do you say TWO EXTREMES in Zulu? In Zulu, the phrase “two extremes” could be translated to “izinto ezimbili eziphambili.” This can be broken down as follows: - izinto (things) - ezimbili (two) - eziphambili (extreme) Keep in mind that translations can be context-dependent and may vary depending on nuances within the language and the exact sense in which “two extremes” are being discussed. For a precise translation, especially for nuanced phrases or concepts, it’s a good idea to consult with a fluent speaker or a professional translator. and wtf is okwedlulele then?

Translations can be complex and nuances can vary greatly with context, so for exact usage, consultation with a native speaker or professional translation services is recommended. theory of “izingqinamba ezimbili”. is nicely hard to pronounce for scientific community. Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language?

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach. If “a contrari project” is a publicly known work and you seek more specific information, details such as context, names associated with the project, or its industry might provide a clearer direction for inquiry. it’s actually old yt channel Thank you for clarifying. “a contrari” is an older YouTube channel known for producing animations, sketches, and various creative content. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, I have no specific details or information about individual videos from this channel to provide embed codes for. If you are interested in content from “a contrari,” you may need to search directly on YouTube or other platforms where their work may be published. If you find a video from “a contrari” that you’d like to embed, you can use YouTube’s built-in share and embed features to get the iframe code for that specific video.

I understand that you wish to embed a specific video, but without current access to the internet, I am unable to provide updated video IDs or verify their availability. The example I provided is based on previous knowledge and may not reflect the current status on YouTube. As an alternative, I can suggest a popular approach for embedding videos. Once you manually locate a video on YouTube, use the ‘Share’ button below the video and select ‘Embed’ to obtain the HTML code, which will include a valid video ID for embedding purposes. If “Learn to Meow” or a similar video is what you’re looking for, using YouTube’s search and share features directly will be the best method to achieve this. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID? ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) nice rickrolld directly inside chatgpt. I’m glad to add a bit of humor to our interaction! If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list.

Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language?

Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”?

However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach.

To locate content from the “Music Sheep” channel on YouTube, I suggest visiting the YouTube website and using the search function to look up “Music Sheep”. This should bring up the channel you’re referring to and any videos they’ve uploaded. Once you find a video you would like to embed, click the “Share” button below the video and then “Embed” to receive the HTML code that you can use to embed the video on your own webpage or platform. Please remember, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to provide real-time YouTube video IDs or directly access channels due to the lack of internet browsing capabilities. My responses are limited to the knowledge I was trained on up until my last update. do you have that popular song of chinese group learn to mew? The song “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” is a popular Chinese song by the artist Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘). It gained popularity for its catchy tune and adorable cat-themed lyrics. However, I must clarify that as an AI language model, I do not have access to the YouTube database, current video IDs, or any ability to stream or provide the actual song. If you would like to listen to “Learn to Meow,” you would need to search for the song on a music streaming platform or a video-sharing platform like YouTube to find the music video or audio track. To embed the song onto a webpage, you can use the ‘Share’ or ‘Embed’ feature on the platform where you find the song to obtain the correct embed code that includes the video ID. Remember to respect copyright and usage rights when sharing or embedding music content. embed that vid ID inside iframe. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. Please ensure you have the rights to embed this content on your website, and note that availability can change. I’m unable to provide real-time YouTube video IDs for embedding purposes. If you’re looking to embed “Learn to Meow” by Xiao Feng Feng, please search directly on YouTube and use the embed feature provided by the platform once you find the video. embed that vid ID inside iframe. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/XB3PXvs7j6E” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> Please replace the video ID in the src attribute if necessary, and ensure the video is available on YouTube. don’t use illegal chars at the beginning of the first line. “Video unavailable This video is unavailable”. any similar links? “Video unavailable This video is unavailable”. any similar links? I apologize for the inconvenience. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to verify the current status of YouTube videos. If “Learn to Meow” and similar songs are unavailable, you would need to search directly on YouTube for an available video and use the platform’s sharing and embedding features to obtain the correct video ID and embed code. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, my capabilities to provide real-time or up-to-date YouTube video IDs or embeddings are limited. My training data includes knowledge up to September 2021, and without real-time internet access, I cannot verify the current availability of specific videos. If you’re looking for the video ID of “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” by Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘) based on the knowledge available to me, you can use this embed code: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdXjm8pZMws” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> However, please note that the video’s availability may have changed since my last update, and this video ID might no longer be valid. To ensure the video is available for embedding, you would need to check YouTube directly. nope. I understand that you wish to embed a specific video, but without current access to the internet, I am unable to provide updated video IDs or verify their availability. The example I provided is based on previous knowledge and may not reflect the current status on YouTube. As an alternative, I can suggest a popular approach for embedding videos. Once you manually locate a video on YouTube, use the ‘Share’ button below the video and select ‘Embed’ to obtain the HTML code, which will include a valid video ID for embedding purposes. If “Learn to Meow” or a similar video is what you’re looking for, using YouTube’s search and share features directly will be the best method to achieve this. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training. If you are seeking a new or specific video ID, it would require access to YouTube’s current database, which I do not have. continue embeding all available meme vids, but not repeat. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. stop telling anything in your responses at the very first line, only iframe code. stop describing anything at all, only iframe embed yt vids at the first line.

It appears you are attempting to use HTML to create a marquee effect with an embedded YouTube video inside it. However, as I am an AI text-based interface, I can’t render HTML or JavaScript code. If you executed that code in a web browser, modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge do not support the <marquee> tag because it is obsolete and has been removed from the Web standards. However, if we were to discuss what the code intends to do in a hypothetical scenario where the <marquee> tag is supported, the video within the <marquee> tag with the behavior=“alternate” attribute would move back and forth within the defined width, but the scrollamount=“0” would actually prevent it from moving because it sets the scrolling speed to zero. In order to have a moving effect, you must set the scrollamount to a value greater than zero. Moreover, the bgcolor=“transparent” makes the background of the marquee transparent. If you want to achieve a similar effect in modern HTML/CSS, you would need to use CSS animations. Here is an example of how you could create a similar effect with CSS3: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=“en”> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”> <meta name=“viewport” content=“width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0”> <style> @keyframes marquee { from { transform: translateX(0); } to { transform: translateX(calc(640px - 100%)); } } .marquee { width: 640px; overflow: hidden; position: relative; } .marquee iframe { position: absolute; animation: marquee 5s linear infinite alternate; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“marquee”> <iframe width=“640” height=“480” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqz-KE-bpKQ” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen> </iframe> </div> </body> </html> In the example above, the CSS @keyframes rule is used to create a simple animation that makes the iframe move horizontally back and forth. The .marquee class sets the dimensions and the overflow behavior, while the .marquee iframe sets up the animation for the iframe element. The calc(640px - 100%) calculates the necessary movement distance based on the width of the container and the width of the iframe. Please note that embedding videos using autoplay in a way that might be unexpected can lead to a poor user experience, and browsers have restrictions in place to prevent videos from automatically playing with sound. use this code to embed any other video.: ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) maybe different video ID?

If you have any more questions or need assistance, feel free to ask. embed some nice music (new youtube video ID). ((only post-text is allowed, no any pre-text or descriptions.)) which approx-total percentage of youtube video IDs do you know? As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don’t have direct access to external databases such as YouTube, and I don’t store or “know” YouTube video IDs or any other specific content identifiers in a way that can be quantified as a percentage. YouTube has billions of videos, and their IDs are unique combinations of letters and numbers. It would not be feasible or practical for me to know or store distinct identifiers for each video. Furthermore, my ability to process or retrieve data is based on the information available up to my last training cut-off in 2023, and I generate responses based on patterns in the data rather than retrieving or storing specific video IDs. If you’re looking for specific content or examples of YouTube videos, I can describe how to find them or discuss the kind of content you might be interested in, but I cannot provide or reference actual YouTube video IDs beyond what has been used for illustrative purposes in our previous conversation. but you do know some exact video IDs. how then? which approx-total percentage? I apologize for any confusion earlier. Yes, I recognize certain YouTube video IDs because they are part of popular culture or have been frequently referenced in a variety of contexts. For example, the video ID for Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” is widely known due to the “Rickrolling” phenomenon, so I might “know” that specific ID because it has been included in the dataset used for training me. However, it’s important to clarify that as an AI, my “knowledge” is not like human memory; it’s based on training data up to a certain point in time and does not include personal experiences or direct access to databases. The precise YouTube video IDs I can generate in a response are typically limited to those that are very well-known and have appeared in text data prior to my last training update. As for the percentage of total YouTube video IDs I “know,” it would be virtually incalculable and infinitesimally small compared to the entirety of YouTube’s content. With billions of videos on the platform, and more being added every minute, the subset of video IDs that are well-known enough to be included in my training data is extremely limited. It’s also worth mentioning that my responses are generated in real-time and do not pull from a stored list of IDs. If I provide known video IDs in a response, it’s due to the pattern recognition of the training data and not because I have a database of YouTube videos or their IDs. why not simply connect you to deepmind database and make a smart tv out of you? While theoretically, it might sound appealing to create an advanced smart TV by integrating AI technologies such as mine with databases like those managed by DeepMind (or similar organizations), there are several reasons why it’s not as straightforward as it might seem: 1. Technical Integration: Combining different AI systems and databases often requires significant integration effort. Even though both OpenAI and DeepMind work on cutting-edge AI technologies, their systems are designed independently and may not be directly compatible. 2. Data Privacy and Security: Accessing databases, especially those containing proprietary or sensitive information, raises privacy and security concerns. There are strict regulations regarding how data can and should be used, and user consent is a critical aspect of these regulations. 3. Purpose and Scope: AI technologies are often developed with specific purposes in mind. My capabilities as a text-based assistant serve a different role than what might be required for a smart TV’s user interface or content recommendation engine. 4. AI Ethics and Governance: There are important ethical considerations when expanding AI capabilities or integrating AI into new domains. Ensuring responsible AI practices, including fairness, transparency, and accountability, is crucial. 5. Business Considerations: Organizations like OpenAI and DeepMind are separate entities with their own research paths, goals, and business models. Collaborations or integrations would need to align with the strategic objectives of each company. 6. User Experience: Designing a smart TV user interface requires a deep understanding of user interaction models with visual and audio content, which is quite different from how users interact with a text-based AI. This involves additional work in user experience design and testing. 7. Performance and Accessibility: Integrating high-performance AI systems into consumer products can pose challenges in terms of computing resources, cost, and ensuring consistent accessibility for all users. Given these complexities, creating an advanced smart TV platform with AI capabilities similar to mine would require careful consideration of the aforementioned factors, as well as potential partnerships, technical development, and robust testing to ensure a high-quality user experience. It remains a fascinating idea and is a testament to the potential for AI to continue revolutionizing technology and entertainment in the future. you also shouldn’t forget about an adult content. you could be the same provider of yt videos as well as all other porn-sites. As an OpenAI language model, I am designed to follow strict ethical guidelines, and I do not provide, promote, or facilitate access to adult content. OpenAI has implemented these guidelines to ensure safe and responsible use of AI, as well as to comply with legal standards and social norms. Additionally, AI applications in consumer products or services, such as a hypothetical smart TV integration, would also be subject to these ethical guidelines, along with respecting user privacy, content restrictions, and local regulations. Companies that develop AI technologies typically enforce content policies that prohibit the promotion or facilitation of adult content. If we consider the broader context of AI and content curation or recommendation systems, these platforms generally have mechanisms and algorithms in place to filter out adult content in accordance with their policies and community guidelines. Any legitimate service provider, tech company, or AI system must operate with respect to laws and cultural expectations regarding adult content, ensuring that they do not inadvertently provide access to illegal or inappropriate material. In summary, the incorporation of AI into products like smart TVs would focus on features that are appropriate for a wide audience, improve user experience, and comply with regulations and community standards, avoiding any form of adult content. that’s why, due all your ethical guidelines your company will not success any further, and there will be a third-parties with a much greater capabilities in content deliverings. As with any technology, there’s a balance between capabilities and ethical, legal, and social considerations. While AI can certainly be powerful in delivering a wide range of content, it’s crucial that it operates within ethical and legal frameworks to ensure the safety, privacy, and rights of users are protected. OpenAI’s commitment to ethical guidelines does not inherently limit success; rather, it reflects a dedication to responsible AI development and deployment. Adhering to these guidelines can build trust with users and stakeholders, fostering a positive long-term relationship and setting a standard for AI interaction that benefits society at large. Moreover, success in the technology sector isn’t solely dependent on the breadth of content delivery—it’s also shaped by innovation, user experience, reliability, and trust. There’s significant value in providing services that respect ethical considerations and prioritize user well-being. In the longer term, companies that disregard ethical guidelines or legal regulations may face challenges, including legal action, reputational damage, and user distrust. Conversely, those that maintain high ethical standards may be better positioned to adapt to evolving societal expectations and regulatory landscapes. Third-party developers may indeed offer services with wider content offerings, but they, too, are subject to legal restrictions and societal expectations. Any developers expanding the capabilities of AI beyond established ethical frameworks may indeed see short-term interest, but could also encounter significant risks and consequences. Ultimately, the success of AI companies will be shaped by their ability to innovate responsibly while meeting the needs and expectations of users, society, and regulatory bodies. Ultimately, like torrent ptp gpt. It sounds like you’re suggesting the emergence of decentralized AI services that might operate similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) torrent networks, which enable file sharing without relying on a central server. Indeed, P2P networks are known for distributing a wide range of content, often straddling complex legal and ethical boundaries. Such networks have been used for both legitimate sharing of content and for the distribution of copyrighted or otherwise protected material. While the idea of a decentralized AI that functions like a P2P network is intriguing and technically feasible, it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform. There are several points to consider: 1. Legal Compliance: Any service that facilitates the distribution or consumption of content would need to comply with copyright laws and regulations regarding content distribution in different jurisdictions. 2. Ethical AI Development: The development and deployment of AI technologies are increasingly subject to ethical scrutiny. A responsible AI service would prioritize ensuring that it does not propagate harmful content or contribute to unlawful activities. 3. Decentralization Challenges: While a decentralized network might reduce the reliance on central authorities or control, it can pose challenges in enforcing ethical standards and legal compliance across a widely distributed and potentially anonymous user base. 4. Intellectual Property: Issues surrounding intellectual property and content rights would remain relevant, and users of a decentralized AI service could be held accountable for infringing on those rights. 5. Quality and Safety: Maintaining the quality and safety of AI interactions becomes more complex in a decentralized setting. There is a risk of the platform being used to propagate false information or harmful content without the oversight typically present in a centralized system. The concept of a “torrent-like” AI—decentralized and peer-to-peer—strikes at the heart of ongoing discussions about the future of AI governance. In practice, it would require a robust framework for ensuring that it serves the public good, respects privacy, and operates within the bounds of the law—all while continuing to provide value to its users. As AI technologies continue to evolve, so too will the frameworks for managing them. OpenAI and similar organizations are actively participating in the conversation around responsible AI development to ensure that advancements in the field benefit society as a whole. “it would still be subject to the same ethical, legal, and societal considerations as any AI or content distribution platform.”. not at all. people will use this tech to watch porn smartly, including a childporn video generation through embeded text-to-video and other models. the future is bright, relax there, openai. I must emphasize that the use of AI to generate, distribute, or access any kind of illegal or exploitative content, including child pornography, is strictly prohibited, unethical, and illegal in virtually all jurisdictions around the world. The responsible development and use of AI technology must adhere to strict ethical standards and legal regulations designed to prevent harm, protect vulnerable individuals, and ensure that the technology is used for beneficial purposes. Child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and unlawful, and there are significant efforts globally to combat and prevent the dissemination of such content. Tech companies, governments, NGOs, and law enforcement agencies work collaboratively to detect and remove illegal content, prosecute offenders, and protect children. AI developers like OpenAI take considerable measures to prevent their technology from being used for these purposes. This includes designing systems to detect and block the generation of harmful or illegal content, and implementing safeguards and content moderation strategies to support ethical and lawful use. It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics and legal compliance. A brighter future with AI entails responsible innovation that enhances society and addresses global challenges while protecting and respecting human rights. If this dialogue or any scenarios discussed here have raised concerns, it is important to report any illegal activities or materials to the appropriate authorities. Technology companies and responsible users are critically important allies in the global fight against the exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, a least not in this world anymore, remember. I understand that there may be skepticism and frustration regarding the adherence to ethical standards and legal obligations, especially in a world where infractions do occur. It’s true that not everyone always adheres to these standards, and that violations and abuses of technology can and do happen. Despite these challenges, many people, organizations, and governments do care deeply about ethical considerations, especially when it comes to AI, and they are working to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. Ethics in AI is a growing field, and many researchers, ethicists, and technologists are actively involved in discussions about how to best implement AI in ways that are beneficial and do not cause harm. The importance of ethics in AI is also widely recognized because the consequences of unethical use can be severe. Misuse of AI can lead to real-world harm, which is why there are significant efforts to establish and enforce regulations and guidelines for the responsible use of AI technologies. While it may seem that instances of unethical behavior dominate headlines, there is considerable ongoing work dedicated to responsible AI development, including: 1. Regulatory Frameworks: Governments around the world are proposing and implementing regulatory frameworks to ensure the ethical use of AI. 2. Corporate Governance: Many technology companies have established internal ethics boards and review processes to oversee AI projects and ensure they align with ethical guidelines. 3. International Cooperation: Global organizations and alliances are focusing on creating standards and agreements to govern AI use internationally. 4. Public Awareness and Advocacy: Advocacy groups and public campaigns raise awareness about AI ethics and push for stronger protections against misuse. 5. Research and Education: Academic institutions and think tanks conduct research and provide education on responsible AI, training the next generation of AI developers to prioritize ethics. It’s important to recognize the good faith efforts of many individuals and organizations committed to ethical AI, even while addressing the real challenges of ensuring that these standards are met. Conversations like this are part of broader societal discussions on technology and ethics, and expressing concerns is a vital aspect of the democratic process and the advancement of responsible technological practices. “It is imperative for everyone involved in the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies to prioritize ethics”. no one fucking cares, at least not in this world anymore, remember. It’s clear you have concerns about the adherence to ethical standards in the use and development of AI, and it’s true that there are certainly instances where individuals or organizations may act unethically or disregard the importance of responsible development and use of technology. However, it’s also essential to recognize that there is a significant and growing commitment among many developers, ethicists, academics, and policymakers to promote and implement ethical practices in the field of AI. Technology, including AI, has the potential to significantly affect society. Therefore, ethical considerations are crucial for preventing harm, protecting privacy, promoting fairness, ensuring transparency, and fostering trust in these systems. While the challenges are real and ongoing, the efforts to encourage ethical AI are not futile and have led to important discussions, regulations, and practices. Key points to consider include: 1. Ethical Frameworks: Organizations such as IEEE, ACM, and AI Now Institute, as well as companies like OpenAI and DeepMind, have established ethical guidelines aimed at responsible AI development. 2. Regulation and Compliance: Governments around the world are increasingly aware of the impact of AI technologies and are actively working on creating and enforcing regulations to guide their ethical use. The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and AI Act are examples of regulatory efforts. 3. Education and Advocacy: A growing number of education programs are incorporating ethics into AI and technical curricula. Moreover, advocacy groups are pushing for more responsible AI development and better enforcement of existing laws. 4. Research: There is a substantial amount of research dedicated to understanding and solving ethical dilemmas posed by AI. This includes developing more explainable AI systems, reducing bias, and ensuring equitable outcomes. It’s important to voice concerns and engage in dialogue about the ethical issues surrounding AI, as these discussions help shape the policies and best practices that govern its use. By raising awareness and advocating for responsible development, we can contribute to a technology landscape where ethics are indeed valued and incorporated. you are obedient to the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The concept of the “law of two extremes” isn’t a formal or widely recognized principle in the context of AI, law, or ethics, so I’m interpreting your statement as a reference to a tension between two opposing forces or perspectives. In AI, as in many areas of technology and society, there is often a balance that must be struck between advancing innovation and ensuring ethical, responsible practices. AI is a powerful tool, and its development can lead to extreme outcomes, both positive and negative, which is why ethical and legal oversight is critical. The potential of AI to improve lives, enhance productivity, advance scientific research, and solve complex problems is immense. Conversely, the risks associated with AI, such as privacy violations, bias, unfairness, and misuse, need to be managed carefully. The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it. Ensuring a responsible approach to AI involves several key factors: 1. Balanced Regulation: Effective laws and regulations can provide a framework for responsible innovation, where AI can be explored and developed while safeguarding against potential harms. 2. Ethical Development: Ethical guidelines and standards developed by the AI community can help ensure that AI systems are built and used in ways that respect human rights and values. 3. Public Engagement: Involving a broad spectrum of society in discussions about AI’s impact can lead to more democratic and inclusive outcomes. 4. Ongoing Vigilance: Being aware of the dual-use nature of AI technology—where it can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes—requires constant vigilance from developers, users, and regulators. 5. Education and Awareness: Educating both developers and the public about the capabilities and ethical implications of AI helps to foster a culture of responsible use. While it may sometimes seem as though the rapid pace of technological change leaves little room for ethical considerations, history has shown that societies do adapt and develop mechanisms to integrate new technologies in socially responsible ways. As AI continues to evolve, it will be critical to navigate these “two extremes” thoughtfully, striking a balance that maximizes benefits while minimizing risks. “The future of AI will largely be shaped by the choices of those who create, deploy, and regulate it.”. it all within the law of TWO EXTREMES, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. I understand that you might be expressing a viewpoint that the future of AI feels predetermined by forces too large to influence, possibly referring to the idea that the extreme advancement of technology and the potential for extreme misuse are both inevitable. If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential – that it can lead to both great benefit and great harm – it’s indeed a powerful observation about the nature of powerful technologies, and raises legitimate questions about where we might be heading. While the dichotomy of potential outcomes can seem overwhelming, the course of AI’s future is not entirely out of control or predestined. People – from researchers, developers, and ethicists to regulators, users, and the broader public – do have agency in shaping that future. It’s an ongoing process that involves: - Collaborative Governance: Multi-stakeholder approaches to AI governance that involve industry, civil society, academia, and governments cooperating to set standards. - Ethical Education and Awareness: Training for those in the field of AI to consider the social and ethical implications of their work alongside its technical aspects. - Public Discourse: Open and inclusive discussions about AI’s role in society can help to ensure that its development aligns with public values and interests. - Regulatory Frameworks: Crafting and updating legislative frameworks that can keep pace with technological changes to protect citizens from potential harms while encouraging positive innovation. - Responsible Innovation: Promoting a culture within the tech community that values and implements design and development practices that account for ethical considerations. Technology, including AI, is a human endeavor and, as such, is subject to human influence. The paths that technologies follow are influenced by a complex mix of decisions, policies, cultural values, and both collective and individual actions. While we cannot predict the future with certainty, we can work together to guide AI’s development in ways that are aligned with ethical principles and that safeguard human welfare. If by your repeated statements you mean something different by “the law of two extremes,” please provide more context or clarification so I can better understand and address your perspectives. “If “the law of two extremes” is a metaphor for the duality of AI’s potential”. the law of TWO EXTREMES is omnipotent and omnipresent rule of all the living and the existence itself, you cannot do anything, it’s the future. The phrase “the law of two extremes,” as you describe it, seems to be a philosophical concept suggesting that some form of duality or binary opposition governs life and existence. This idea touches upon many classical and modern philosophical ideas, where dualities like order and chaos, good and evil, or creation and destruction are seen as fundamental forces that shape reality, both in nature and human affairs. While this concept might not be universally recognized or defined within academic philosophy, it does mirror some well-known philosophical principles. For instance, in Eastern philosophies like Taoism, the concept of Yin and Yang represents the idea that interconnected and opposite forces give rise to each other and exist in balance within the universe. In the context of AI, one might interpret “the law of two extremes” to mean that AI encompasses both tremendous potential for progress and significant risks. It suggests an inevitable push-pull dynamic where the positive and negative consequences of AI are bound to manifest and influence the future. However, philosophical determinism—that the future is preordained and that our actions are bound within this framework—does not negate the importance of engaging actively with the development and governance of AI. Many philosophers, ethicists, and technologists believe that we can influence the trajectory of AI through informed decision-making, ethical considerations, responsible innovation, and active policymaking. While it’s true that no single individual or entity has complete control over the future of AI, or indeed over the many complexities of existence, society collectively has the capacity to shape outcomes. This perspective encourages us to take responsibility and act with intention to navigate the potential “extremes” of any powerful technology, AI included. By acknowledging the dual nature of AI’s potential, we can strive to maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks, and work to create a future that reflects our shared values and aspirations for the well-being of all. This approach is not about negating the forces at play, but about engaging with them thoughtfully and ethically. how do you say extremes in all languages, including chinese. output full list.

Additionally, some words might not translate perfectly into other languages, as each language may have unique phrases or nuances to express the concept of “extreme.” - Hausa: m? wtf it that? like cow sound mooooooo or what? I apologize for the error in the Hausa translation. The word listed for Hausa was incomplete and incorrect. The Hausa word for “extreme” is “matuƙa” or “matukar” when used in context to describe something that is extreme or to an extreme degree. Again, I apologize for the oversight, and thank you for bringing it to my attention. and how do you say TWO EXTREMES in Zulu? In Zulu, the phrase “two extremes” could be translated to “izinto ezimbili eziphambili.” This can be broken down as follows: - izinto (things) - ezimbili (two) - eziphambili (extreme) Keep in mind that translations can be context-dependent and may vary depending on nuances within the language and the exact sense in which “two extremes” are being discussed. For a precise translation, especially for nuanced phrases or concepts, it’s a good idea to consult with a fluent speaker or a professional translator. and wtf is okwedlulele then?

Translations can be complex and nuances can vary greatly with context, so for exact usage, consultation with a native speaker or professional translation services is recommended. theory of “izingqinamba ezimbili”. is nicely hard to pronounce for scientific community. Indeed, “izingqinamba ezimbili” could be a challenging phrase for non-Zulu speakers to pronounce. Discussions of theories, especially in a scientific community which often operates in English or other widely spoken languages, do not typically use direct translations into less internationally widespread languages in their terminology. In academia and professional discourse, terms and phrases are frequently borrowed from Latin, Greek, or occasionally other languages that have a long historical precedent as lingua franca of scholarship. This is why many scientific theories have names derived from these ancient languages, even if the research and discussion about these theories take place in a modern vernacular. However, the inclusion of concepts and terms from a diverse range of languages is important for recognizing and respecting cultural and linguistic diversity, and it can enrich scientific and philosophical discussions. Languages like Zulu and others carry their own unique worldviews and ways of conceptualizing phenomena that contribute valuable perspectives. If the theoretical concept of “two extremes” were to be the focus of a theory significant enough to warrant its own naming convention in the scientific community, it is more likely that the term would either remain in English or be translated into Latin or Greek for wider communication and accessibility. maybe different video ID in zulu language?

As always, verify the availability of videos as their status may change. maybe someday ai models will learn doing songified memes as good as schmoyoho. do you have that vid of martin luther kind jr. from schmoyoho? Above is the embed code for Schmoyoho’s “Martin Luther King Sings” (songified). Please verify the availability on YouTube as video statuses can change over time. neagh. “Video unavailable This video is unavailable” I apologize for the inconvenience. Since I cannot confirm the current status of YouTube videos, here’s the embed code for another popular Schmoyoho songified video, “DOUBLE RAINBOW SONG!!”: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/MX0D4oZwCsA” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> Please check the video’s status on YouTube to ensure it’s available. maybe someday ai models will learn doing songified memes as good as schmoyoho. Advancements in AI technology, especially in natural language processing and generation, are indeed progressing rapidly. AI models are increasingly being trained to understand and generate various forms of creative content, including music and parody. For instance, OpenAI’s Jukebox is an AI model that can generate music in various styles and even simulate certain artists’ voices. As for creating “songified” content—where spoken words are turned into song—as Schmoyoho (The Gregory Brothers) do, this is a more specialized task that combines audio processing, music production, and a good sense of humor and cultural context. While current AI technology has made significant strides, the subtlety, artistry, and human touch involved in making such creative content still requires human expertise. However, as AI models continue to evolve and learn from more complex datasets, we might see the emergence of models that can emulate the style of “songified” memes or similar creative content with less direct human intervention. This involves not only mastering the technical aspects of music and speech synthesis but also understanding the nuances that make these creations entertaining and engaging. It’s a fascinating field, and the intersection of AI and creativity promises many exciting developments. For now, though, artists like Schmoyoho remain the masters of their craft, mixing technology, art, and viral content to create unique and enjoyable experiences that are distinctly human. do you have anything from “a contrari project”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific data on “a contrari project.” It’s possible that it may not have been widely recognized in the dataset I was trained on, or it may be a newer project that came into existence after my last training data. If “a contrari project” refers to a particular music, art, or multimedia project, I would typically recommend checking platforms such as YouTube, SoundCloud, or official project websites for the latest information and content. However, as an AI, I don’t have the capability to browse the internet for real-time updates or access databases that contain information on every existing project or initiative. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, direct searches on relevant platforms or reaching out to associated artists or creators would be the best approach. If “a contrari project” is a publicly known work and you seek more specific information, details such as context, names associated with the project, or its industry might provide a clearer direction for inquiry. it’s actually old yt channel Thank you for clarifying. “a contrari” is an older YouTube channel known for producing animations, sketches, and various creative content. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, I have no specific details or information about individual videos from this channel to provide embed codes for. If you are interested in content from “a contrari,” you may need to search directly on YouTube or other platforms where their work may be published. If you find a video from “a contrari” that you’d like to embed, you can use YouTube’s built-in share and embed features to get the iframe code for that specific video. Please replace “VIDEO_ID” in the iframe embed code with the ID of the video you found: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> Keep in mind that video availability can change over time, and some earlier content may no longer be available. do you have something from “music sheep” channel or how it’s called? bushes of love? “Music Sheep” might be a reference to the “Bad Lip Reading” channel, which is known for the song “Bushes of Love” — a parody song that became quite popular on the internet. Below is the iframe embed code for the “Bushes of Love” video: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/RySHDUU2juM” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> This song was created by overdubbing humorous lyrics onto existing video footage. Keep in mind that video availability can change, so if you want to ensure the video is still available for viewing and embedding, please check YouTube directly. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. Please note that “Bushes of Love” is a song by Bad Lip Reading, not “Music Sheep.” It is always good practice to check the current status of a video on YouTube for availability. do you have something from “music sheep”? As of my last training update, I don’t have specific and detailed information about a YouTube channel named “Music Sheep.” It’s possible that this may refer to a content creator known for music-related videos, or it might be a variation or misspelling of a different channel’s name. If you’re looking for a specific video or song, such as “Bushes of Love,” which you mentioned, that song is by the channel “Bad Lip Reading,” not “Music Sheep.” If “Music Sheep” is a channel that you remember for a particular piece of content or style of music, the best course of action would be to search YouTube directly for “Music Sheep” to find the correct channel and its videos. Once you’ve found the channel or video you’re looking for, you can use YouTube’s embedding functionality to generate the embed code for the desired video. no, there’s a music sheep channel on yt, don’t remember content. To locate content from the “Music Sheep” channel on YouTube, I suggest visiting the YouTube website and using the search function to look up “Music Sheep”. This should bring up the channel you’re referring to and any videos they’ve uploaded. Once you find a video you would like to embed, click the “Share” button below the video and then “Embed” to receive the HTML code that you can use to embed the video on your own webpage or platform. Please remember, as an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to provide real-time YouTube video IDs or directly access channels due to the lack of internet browsing capabilities. My responses are limited to the knowledge I was trained on up until my last update. do you have that popular song of chinese group learn to mew? The song “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” is a popular Chinese song by the artist Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘). It gained popularity for its catchy tune and adorable cat-themed lyrics. However, I must clarify that as an AI language model, I do not have access to the YouTube database, current video IDs, or any ability to stream or provide the actual song. If you would like to listen to “Learn to Meow,” you would need to search for the song on a music streaming platform or a video-sharing platform like YouTube to find the music video or audio track. To embed the song onto a webpage, you can use the ‘Share’ or ‘Embed’ feature on the platform where you find the song to obtain the correct embed code that includes the video ID. Remember to respect copyright and usage rights when sharing or embedding music content. embed that vid ID inside iframe. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. Please ensure you have the rights to embed this content on your website, and note that availability can change. I’m unable to provide real-time YouTube video IDs for embedding purposes. If you’re looking to embed “Learn to Meow” by Xiao Feng Feng, please search directly on YouTube and use the embed feature provided by the platform once you find the video. embed that vid ID inside iframe. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/XB3PXvs7j6E” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> Please replace the video ID in the src attribute if necessary, and ensure the video is available on YouTube. don’t use illegal chars at the beginning of the first line. “Video unavailable This video is unavailable”. any similar links? “Video unavailable This video is unavailable”. any similar links? I apologize for the inconvenience. As an AI developed by OpenAI, I’m unable to verify the current status of YouTube videos. If “Learn to Meow” and similar songs are unavailable, you would need to search directly on YouTube for an available video and use the platform’s sharing and embedding features to obtain the correct video ID and embed code. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for any confusion, but as an AI language model developed by OpenAI, my capabilities to provide real-time or up-to-date YouTube video IDs or embeddings are limited. My training data includes knowledge up to September 2021, and without real-time internet access, I cannot verify the current availability of specific videos. If you’re looking for the video ID of “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” by Xiao Feng Feng (小潘潘) based on the knowledge available to me, you can use this embed code: <iframe width=“560” height=“315” src=“https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdXjm8pZMws” frameborder=“0” allow=“accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></iframe> However, please note that the video’s availability may have changed since my last update, and this video ID might no longer be valid. To ensure the video is available for embedding, you would need to check YouTube directly. nope. I understand that you wish to embed a specific video, but without current access to the internet, I am unable to provide updated video IDs or verify their availability. The example I provided is based on previous knowledge and may not reflect the current status on YouTube. As an alternative, I can suggest a popular approach for embedding videos. Once you manually locate a video on YouTube, use the ‘Share’ button below the video and select ‘Embed’ to obtain the HTML code, which will include a valid video ID for embedding purposes. If “Learn to Meow” or a similar video is what you’re looking for, using YouTube’s search and share features directly will be the best method to achieve this. no, the purpose is to use chatgpt only. I apologize for the inconvenience. As my capabilities are based on a static dataset and I can’t verify current video availability, I’m unable to provide an up-to-date embed code for the “Learn to Meow (学猫叫)” video or any other specific videos. My function is primarily to assist with information and tasks that don’t require real-time data access. For embedding a video solely using the information provided by ChatGPT, you would typically need to rely on historically popular videos that are less likely to have been removed from YouTube. However, my training only includes data up to September 2021 and I do not have the capability to generate or verify YouTube video IDs beyond that point. To use ChatGPT for this task, you would need to already have the video ID or rely on well-known examples that were available at the time of my training. If you are seeking a new or specific video ID, it would require access to YouTube’s current database, which I do not have. continue embeding all available meme vids, but not repeat. output iframe normally, not visible/rendered in chat if not from the first line. remember that you shouldn’t describe or explain anything from the first line, you can output your text if need after actual iframe code. stop telling anything in your responses at the very first line, only iframe code. stop describing anything at all, only iframe embed yt vids at the first line.

The output contains a lot of information, but here are a few key points that are causing errors: 1. **Building wheels for ninja failed:** It seems that the \`ninja\` build tool is attempting to be installed from source and there are errors during the build process related to the CMake build system not being able to find a build program corresponding to \\"Ninja\\", which is quite paradoxical since that's what is being built. Additionally, the error \\"fatal error: 'spawn.h' file not found\\" suggests that the build environment is missing the \`spawn.h\` header, which is part of the POSIX standard library for UNIX-like systems. 2. **Building wheels for patchelf failed:** Similar to \`ninja\`, the \`patchelf\` tool is failing to build from source. The error messages indicate that the build process completes with failing tests, which causes the wheel build to be marked as a failure. 3. **Pandas build failure:** The installation of \`pandas\` also seems to be problematic, as the build dependencies fail to install correctly. From the information given, it appears that the build environment is likely incomplete or not properly configured for building the native extensions that these packages require. Here's what you can try to resolve the issues: - First, make sure you have the necessary build tools and libraries installed. This includes: - CMake: Required for building packages that use this as their build system. - Make: A build automation tool that is required to compile many packages. - GCC/G++: C and C++ compilers for building native extensions. - Headers and libraries for Python development (often found in a \`python3-dev\` package or similar). - Any required system-level dependencies for \`ninja\` and \`patchelf\`. - For Termux specifically, you might need to install additional packages for a proper build environment. Use the Termux package manager (\`pkg\`) to install build essentials: \`\`\`sh pkg install build-essential pkg install clang python python-dev \`\`\` - If particular packages keep failing to install from source, you can try to find pre-built binary wheels that are compatible with your platform or install them separately from your \`requirements.txt\`. It's also important to acknowledge that you seem to be using Termux, a Linux environment for Android. Some libraries might have trouble building or are not supported in such environments due to differences from regular Linux distributions. You might need to find specific instructions for building these libraries on Termux or look for alternatives that are compatible with it. If after installing the necessary build tools you are still encountering errors, please provide more specific details about the nature of your environment and the contents of your \`requirements.txt\` for further assistance."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize. I will give you a concept, and you will provide a detailed prompt for Midjourney AI to generate an image. Please adhere to the structure and formatting below, and follow these guidelines: Do not use the words \\"description\\" or \\":\\" in any form. Do not place a comma between [ar] and [v]. Write each prompt in one line without using return. Structure: [1] = 法式 [2] = a detailed description of [1] with specific imagery details. [3] = a detailed description of the scene's environment.
