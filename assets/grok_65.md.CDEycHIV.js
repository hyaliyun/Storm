Therefore, we are interested in finding the probability that a game finishes in 15 minutes or less, which is P(X leqslant 15). Since mu = 20 and sigma = 5, we calculate P(X leqslant 15) using the transformation 15 = mu - sigma = 20 - 5. This is equivalent to finding the probability of X being less than one standard deviation below the mean. Using the given reference data, we know P(mu - sigma < X < mu + sigma) = 0.6827. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, the probabilities on either side of the mean (within one standard deviation) are equal. Hence, the probability of X being less than one standard deviation below the mean is half of the complement of this interval, calculated as frac{1 - 0.6827}{2}. Performing the calculation gives frac{1 - 0.6827}{2} = frac{0.3173}{2} = 0.15865. Rounding this to four decimal places, we get 0.1587.

First, let's convert the dimensions of the room to centimeters: - Length: 6 meters 24 centimeters = 624 centimeters - Width: 4 meters 32 centimeters = 432 centimeters - Height: 3 meters 56 centimeters = 356 centimeters Now, let's calculate the volume of the room in cubic centimeters: Volume = Length × Width × Height Volume = 624 cm × 432 cm × 356 cm Volume = 95,612,928 cubic centimeters Next, we need to find the GCD of the three dimensions (624, 432, and 356) to determine the largest possible side length of a cubic tile.

Let's assume that such a tetrahedron ABCD exists, where all faces are isosceles triangles and no two faces are congruent. 2. We begin by noting that no three edges emanating from the same vertex can be equal. If they were equal (i.e., AB = AC = AD), then among the segments BC, BD, and CD, there must be at least two equal segments (since AB neq BC neq CD cannot hold), making ABCD an isosceles tetrahedron. This scenario implies that among the triangles ABC, ABD, and ACD, there would be at least two congruent triangles, contradicting our assumption. 3. Next, consider two adjacent faces, which are isosceles triangles. These cannot have a common base. Specifically, if AB = AC and DB = DC, then triangles ADB and ADC would be identical, two scenarios contradicting the original assumption. 4. Moreover, none of the triangles can be equilateral. If one triangle were equilateral, for instance, triangle ABC with AB = BC = AC, one of its sides, say AB, would act as a base in connecting triangle ABD and triangle ACD. Both these triangles share a common side, making at least two sides the same, leading to a contradiction (forming an equilateral face implies equal sides meeting in an apex). 5. Proceed under the assumption without loss of generality that AB = AC and BC = BD. Since AD neq AB, triangle ABD would then force AD = BD. Consequently, DC = AB results, implying identities that ABC and ACD are equivalent, again a contradiction. 6.

Using Lucas' Theorem, which states that for a prime p and non-negative integers m and n: [ binom{m}{n} equiv prod_{i=0}^k binom{m_i}{n_i} mod p ] where m_i and n_i are the digits of m and n in base p, we get: [ binom{200}{100} mod 4 ] Converting 200 and 100 to base 4: [ 200_{10} = 3020_4 quad text{and} quad 100_{10} = 1210_4 ] Applying Lucas' Theorem: [ binom{200}{100} equiv binom{3}{1} binom{0}{2} binom{2}{1} binom{0}{0} mod 4 ] Since binom{0}{2} = 0, we have: [ binom{200}{100} equiv 0 mod 4 ] 3. Next, we compute binom{200}{100} mod 25. We use the formula for the exponent of a prime p in n!: [ e_p(n!) = sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{n}{p^i} rightrfloor ] For p = 5, we find the exponents in 200!, 100!, and 100!: [ e_5(200!) = leftlfloor frac{200}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{200}{25} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{200}{125} rightrfloor = 40 + 8 + 1 = 49 ] [ e_5(100!) = leftlfloor frac{100}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{100}{25} rightrfloor = 20 + 4 = 24 ] Therefore, the exponent of 5 in binom{200}{100} is: [ e_5left(binom{200}{100}right) = 49 - 24 - 24 = 1 ] Since binom{200}{100} has exactly one factor of 5, we can write: [ binom{200}{100} = 5k quad text{for some integer } k ] We need to find k mod 5. We know: [ binom{200}{100} = frac{200!}{100! cdot 100!} ] Dividing by 5, we get: [ frac{1}{5} binom{200}{100} = frac{1}{5} prod_{k=1}^{100} frac{100+k}{k} ] Simplifying modulo 5, we get: [ frac{1}{5} binom{200}{100} equiv 14 prod_{1 leq k leq 100, 25 nmid k} left(1 + frac{100}{k}right) mod 5 ] Since all terms of the form 1 + frac{100}{k} are congruent to 1 modulo 5, we have: [ 14 prod_{1 leq k leq 100, 25 nmid k} left(1 + frac{100}{k}right) equiv 14 equiv 4 mod 5 ] Therefore: [ binom{200}{100} equiv 4 cdot 5 equiv 20 mod 25 ] 4. Combining the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem: [ binom{200}{100} equiv 0 mod 4 ] [ binom{200}{100} equiv 20 mod 25 ] We need to find x such that: [ x equiv 0 mod 4 ] [ x equiv 20 mod 25 ] The solution is x = 20.

B: The coefficients of the 5th and 6th terms in the expansion are the largest. C: There exists a constant term in the expansion. D: The coefficient of the term containing x^{4} in the expansion is 210.","completion":"To address the given problem, we proceed through the solution step-by-step as follows: 1. The condition that the binomial coefficients of the 3rd and 9th terms in the expansion are equal can be mathematically expressed as: [C_{n}^{2} = C_{n}^{8}] Given the symmetry in the binomial coefficients, where (C_{n}^{k} = C_{n}^{n-k}), this equality suggests that (n = 10). 2. The sum of all coefficients in the expansion being 1024, along with (a > 0), implies: [(1 + a)^{10} = 2^{10} = 1024] Solving for (a), we find that: [a = 1] 3. For statement A, to find the sum of the binomial coefficients of the even terms in the expansion, we recognize that the sum of all coefficients for a binomial ((1 + a)^{n}) is (2^{n}). Since the coefficients are symmetrically distributed, the sum of the coefficients of the even terms equals half of the total sum: [frac{1}{2} times 2^{10} = 512] Therefore, statement A is correct. 4. For statement B, because (n = 10), the expansion consists of (11) terms in total. The 6th term, being in the middle, would have the largest binomial coefficient. However, the presence of (x) and (frac{a}{sqrt{x}}) in the expansion implies the coefficients depend on more than just the binomial coefficient, making this statement incorrect without further calculation. 5. For statement C, examining the general term for a constant term involves setting the exponent of (x) to zero in: [T_{r+1} = C_{10}^{r} cdot x^{10 - frac{3}{2}r}] Solving (10 - frac{3}{2}r = 0) yields: [r = frac{20}{3} notin mathbb{Z}] This means there cannot be a constant term in the expansion, as (r) must be an integer for a term to exist in the expansion. 6. For statement D, to find the coefficient of the term containing (x^{4}), we set the exponent of (x) in the general term equal to (4): [10 - frac{3}{2}r = 4] Solving for (r), we find: [r = 4] The coefficient of the term containing (x^{4}) is thus determined by (C_{10}^{4}), which calculates as: [C_{10}^{4} = frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 210] Statement D is correct.

Use the double angle identities: [ 2sinalpha cosalpha = sin (2alpha) ] Thus: [ 1 - cos (3alpha) cos 2alpha + sin 3alpha sin 2alpha ] 4. Using the cosine of the sum of angles: [ cos (a - b) = cos a cos b + sin a sin b ] Therefore, [ cos (5alpha) = cos (3alpha + 2alpha) = cos 3alpha cos 2alpha - sin 3alpha sin 2alpha ] Hence: [ - (cos 5alpha) ] 5. Substitute: [ 1 - cos 5alpha ] 6. Use the double angle identity for cosine: [ cos 2x = 1 - 2sin^2 x ] Therefore: [ cos 5alpha = 1 - 2sin^2 left(frac{5alpha}{2}right) ] 7.

For example, for the number 7, Damir writes down 0; for 105, he writes down -4; and for 61, he writes down 5. We need to find out what the sum of all recorded numbers on the board is. 2. **Single-digit Numbers Analysis:** For single-digit numbers (i.e., 1 to 9), the first and last digit are the same. Therefore, the difference is always zero: text{Difference} = text{Digit} - text{Digit} = 0 Thus, these do not contribute to the sum. 3. **Multi-digit Numbers Analysis:** For numbers with more than one digit, we need to consider different cases. **Case 1: Numbers where the first and last digit are the same:** - These numbers will also result in a difference of zero, so they don't contribute to the sum. **Case 2: Numbers that form pairs:** - For numbers where the first digit (a) and the last digit (b) do not coincide, we can pair them with their reverse. For example, the pair (17, 71) produces the differences (1-7 = -6) and (7-1 = 6). These terms cancel each other out, contributing zero to the sum. - Therefore, for any such pair ((a...b)) and ((b...a)), their contributions to the sum are zero because: (a - b) + (b - a) = 0 4. **Numbers with No Pair:** - The numbers that do not have pairs are those ending in 0. For example, (a0, a10, a20, ldots, a90). These numbers contribute their differences directly to the sum calculation: - A number (a0) (where (a=1, 2, ldots, 9)) will contribute (a) directly. - Numbers like (a10, a20,...a90) where the first digit (a) appears 10 times contribute (10a). - Each (a) contributes (11a) in total: a + 10a = 11a 5. **Summing Up All Contributions:** - Each digit (a = 1) to (9) contributes (11a) to the sum. - Summing these contributions for each (a): sum_{a=1}^{9} 11a = 11(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9) - Using the formula for the sum of the first (n) natural numbers: ( frac{n(n+1)}{2} ): 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 9 = frac{9 cdot 10}{2} = 45 - So, the total sum is: 11 cdot 45 = 495 **Conclusion:** The sum of all numbers recorded on the board is: boxed{495}"},{"prompt":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, and if a_1 = 3 and 11a_5 = 5a_8, find the value of n for which the sum of the first n terms S_n is minimized.","completion":"Since {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, we know that a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where d is the common difference.

Note that (sum_{x in F} frac{1}{x} = 0) for no nonempty finite subset (F) of (S). 2. **Unique Finite Subsets and Lemma Introduction**: For every rational ( r ) in ([0,1)), let ( F_{r} ) be the unique finite subset of ( S ) such that (sum_{x in F_{r}} frac{1}{x} = r ). Our argument hinges on the following lemma. 3. **Lemma Proof for Membership Conditions**: **Lemma**: If (x in S) and (q, r) are rationals in ([0,1)) such that (q - r = frac{1}{x}), then (x) is a member of (F_{q}) if and only if it is not in (F_{r}). **Proof**: Suppose (x in F_{q}). Then, [ sum_{y in F_{q} setminus {x}} frac{1}{y} = sum_{y in F_{q}} frac{1}{y} - frac{1}{x} = q - frac{1}{x} = r = sum_{y in F_{r}} frac{1}{y}, ] implying ( F_{r} = F_{q} setminus {x} ) and (x notin F_{r}). Conversely, if ( x notin F_{r} ), then [ sum_{y in F_{r} cup {x}} frac{1}{y} = sum_{y in F_{r}} frac{1}{y} + frac{1}{x} = r + frac{1}{x} = q = sum_{y in F_{q}} frac{1}{y}, ] implying ( F_{q} = F_{r} cup {x} ) and (x in F_{q}). 4. **Characterize Element Membership in Finite Subsets**: Consider an ( x in S ) and a positive rational ( r < 1 ). Let ( n = lfloor rx rfloor ) and consider the sets (F_{r - k/x}) for ( k = 0, ldots, n ). Given (0 leq r - frac{n}{x} < frac{1}{x}), the set ( F_{r - frac{n}{x}} ) does not contain ( x ). Repeated application of the lemma shows that the sets ( F_{r - frac{n - 2k}{x}} ) do not contain ( x ) while ( F_{r - frac{n - 2k - 1}{x}} ) do. Consequently, ( x ) is part of (F_{r}) if and only if (n) is odd. 5. **Examine the Case ( F_{2/3} )**: Consider ( F_{2/3} ). By the preceding steps, ( lfloor frac{2x}{3} rfloor ) is odd for each ( x ) in ( F_{2/3} ), so ( frac{2x}{3} ) is not an integer. Since ( F_{2/3} ) is finite, there exists a positive rational (varepsilon) such that ( lfloor left( frac{2}{3} - varepsilon right) x rfloor = lfloor frac{2x}{3} rfloor ) for all ( x ) in ( F_{2/3} ). This implies ( F_{2/3} ) is a subset of ( F_{2/3 - varepsilon} ), which is impossible. Thus, we should conclude the proof: [ boxed{} ] # 2: In this solution, we consider the structure of ( S ) to verify (2) or prove (1). 1. **Finite Set ( S )**: If (S) is finite, it clearly satisfies (2), as the sum of reciprocals of its finite subsets cannot cover all positive rational numbers less than 1. 2. **Infinite Set ( S )**: Assume (S) is infinite. If (S) fails both conditions, so does (S setminus {1}). We can assume ( S ) consists of integers greater than 1. Label elements of ( S ) increasingly as ( x_{1} < x_{2} < cdots ), where ( x_{1} geq 2 ). 3. **Case: Doubling Condition**: If ( x_{n+1} geq 2 x_{n} ) for all ( n ), then ( x_{n} geq 2^{n-1} x_{1} ). Thus, [ s = sum_{n ge 1} frac{1}{x_{n}} leq sum_{n ge 1} frac{1}{2^{n-1} x_{1}} = frac{2}{x_{1}} ] If ( x_{1} geq 3 ), or ( x_{1} = 2 ) and ( x_{n+1} > 2 x_{n} ) for some ( n ), then the sum of reciprocals of finite subsets of ( S ) is less than 1, so ( S ) satisfies condition (2). 4. **Powers of 2**: If (x_1 = 2) and (x_{n+1}=2x_n) for all (n), then (x_n = 2^n) for all (n). Every finite subset ( F ) of ( S ) consists of powers of (2). Therefore, [ sum_{x in F} frac{1}{x} neq frac{1}{3} ] thus ( S ) satisfies condition (2). 5. **Case: Sublinear Growth**: Suppose ( x_{n+1} < 2x_{n} ) for some ( n ). Consider the positive rational ( r = frac{1}{x_n} - frac{1}{x_{n+1}} < frac{1}{x_{n+1}} ). If no finite subset ( F ) of ( S ) satisfies ( sum_{x in F} frac{1}{x} = r ), then ( S ) satisfies condition (2). 6. **Case: ( r = sum_{x in F_0} frac{1}{x} )**: If ( r = sum_{x in F_0} frac{1}{x} ) for some finite subset ( F_0 ), then ( F_0 ) does not contain (x_{n+1}). Hence, [ sum_{x in F_0 cup {x_{n+1}}} frac{1}{x} = sum_{x in F_0} frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{x_{n+1}} = r + frac{1}{x_{n+1}} = frac{1}{x_n} ] Therefore, (F = F_0 cup { x_{n+1} }) and (G = { x_n }) are distinct finite subsets such that (sum_{x in F} frac{1}{x} = sum_{x in G} frac{1}{x}), so ( S ) satisfies condition (1).

We are given that the area is 39424 square centimeters, so we can set up the equation: 39424 = π * r^2 To find the radius, we divide both sides by π: r^2 = 39424 / π r = √(39424 / π) Now, let's calculate the radius: r = √(39424 / π) r ≈ √(12546.86) r ≈ 112 cm (rounded to the nearest whole number) The perimeter of the square is equal to the radius of the circle, so the perimeter (P) of the square is 112 cm. The perimeter of a square is given by the formula: P = 4 * side Where side is the length of one side of the square. Since the perimeter is 112 cm, we can find the length of one side: side = P / 4 side = 112 / 4 side = 28 cm Now that we have the length of one side of the square, we can find the area of the square: Area = side^2 Area = 28^2 Area = 784 sq cm So, the area of the square is boxed{784} square centimeters."},{"prompt":"Let (f(x)=lg frac {x+1}{x1}) and (g(x)=e^{x}+ frac {1}{e^{x}}), then ( ) A: Both (f(x)) and (g(x)) are odd functions B: (f(x)) is an odd function, (g(x)) is an even function C: Both (f(x)) and (g(x)) are even functions D: (f(x)) is an even function, (g(x)) is an odd functio","completion":"First, the domain of (f(x)) is ((-∞,-1)∪(1,+∞)), and the domain of (g(x)) is (mathbb{R}).

This is because the slope of the tangent line to a function at any point is given by the derivative of the function at that point. If we can find a point where the derivative equals 2, then the line y=2x+m can be tangent to the function at that point. **For option A: f(x)=x^{2}+x** The derivative is f'(x)=2x+1.

By solving the linear system with initial conditions: [ begin{cases} Aalpha + Bbeta = 1 Aalpha^2 + Bbeta^2 = 1 end{cases} ] 4. We now express ( a_{n+1} ) and ( a_{n+2} ): [ a_{n+1} = Aalpha^{n+1} + Bbeta^{n+1} ] [ a_{n+2} = Aalpha^{n+2} + Bbeta^{n+2} ] 5. Using the recurrence relation (a_{n+2} = 2005a_{n+1} - a_n): [ Aalpha^{n+2} + Bbeta^{n+2} = 2005(Aalpha^{n+1} + Bbeta^{n+1}) - (Aalpha^n + Bbeta^n) ] This yields two separate equations from the roots of the characteristic polynomial: [ alpha^{n+2} = 2005alpha^{n+1} - alpha^n ] [ beta^{n+2} = 2005beta^{n+1} - beta^n ] 6. From the expressions involving alpha and beta, write: [ a_{n+1} - alpha a_n = beta^{n-1}(1-alpha) ] [ a_{n+1} - beta a_n = alpha^{n-1}(1-beta) ] 7. Multiply these two equations together: [ (a_{n+1} - alpha a_n)(a_{n+1} - beta a_n) = beta^{n-1} (1-alpha) alpha^{n-1} (1-beta) ] 8. Simplify the left-hand side: [ a_{n+1}^2 - (alpha + beta)a_{n+1}a_n + alphabeta a_n^2 ] Recall that alpha + beta = 2005 and alpha beta = 1, this becomes: [ a_{n+1}^2 - 2005a_{n+1}a_n + a_n^2 = (beta^{n-1} alpha^{n-1})(1 - alpha)(1 - beta) ] 9. Using the initial conditions, the value simplifies to: [ a_{n+1}^2 - 2005a_{n+1} a_n + a_n^2 = -2003 ] Rearrange the equation: [ a_{n+1}a_n - 1 = frac{(a_{n+1} - a_n)^2}{2003} ] 10. Given that (2003) is a prime number, and the term (frac{(a_{n+1} - a_n)^2}{2003}) must be an integer, thus: [ 2003 mid (a_{n+1} - a_n) ] 11. Therefore, the expression becomes: [ a_{n+1} a_n - 1 = 2003 left( frac{a_{n+1} - a_n}{2003} right)^2 ] # Conclusion: The desired property of the sequence {a_n} that the product of any two consecutive terms minus 1 is exactly (2003) times a perfect square is rigorously shown, completing the proof: [ boxed{Thus, proven.} ]"},{"prompt":"For how many real values of x does the equation left| 1xi right| = 2 hold true?","completion":"We start by expressing the magnitude of the complex number: [ left| 1-xi right| = sqrt{(1)^2 + (-x)^2} = sqrt{1 + x^2}. ] Given that left| 1-xi right| = 2, we set up the equation: [ sqrt{1 + x^2} = 2. ] Squaring both sides yields: [ 1 + x^2 = 4. ] Solving for x^2 we have: [ x^2 = 4 - 1 = 3. ] Taking the square root of both sides gives: [ x = pm sqrt{3}. ] Thus, there are two real values of x that satisfy the equation, namely x = sqrt{3} and x = -sqrt{3}.

Let's denote the vertices of the orthogonal parallelepiped as ( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H ) such that ( A, B, C, D ) form one face, ( E, F, G, H ) form the opposite face, and the edges ( AE, BF, CG, DH ) are perpendicular to the faces ( ABCD ) and ( EFGH ). 2. **Partitioning the Parallelepiped**: We need to show that this orthogonal parallelepiped can be partitioned into six right-faced tetrahedra.

This means each face is a right-angled triangle. Let the vertices be ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 ). We need to find ( c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 ) such that the edge lengths satisfy the given condition. - Consider the face ( A_1A_2A_3 ). Since it is a right-angled triangle, we can assume without loss of generality that ( A_1A_2 ) and ( A_1A_3 ) are the legs, and ( A_2A_3 ) is the hypotenuse. Let ( c_1, c_2, c_3 ) be such that: [ A_1A_2 = sqrt{|c_1 - c_2|}, quad A_1A_3 = sqrt{|c_1 - c_3|}, quad A_2A_3 = sqrt{|c_2 - c_3|} ] - Similarly, for the other faces, we can find ( c_4 ) such that the edge lengths involving ( A_4 ) also satisfy the given condition. 3. **Sufficiency (Only If Part)**: Assume there exist four distinct real numbers ( c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 ) such that the edge lengths are given by ( A_jA_k = sqrt{|c_j - c_k|} ).

The edge lengths are: [ A_1A_2 = sqrt{|c_1 - c_2|}, quad A_1A_3 = sqrt{|c_1 - c_3|}, quad A_2A_3 = sqrt{|c_2 - c_3|} ] - Since ( c_1, c_2, c_3 ) are distinct, the triangle ( A_1A_2A_3 ) is a right-angled triangle. - Similarly, for the other faces, the edge lengths involving ( c_4 ) will ensure that the faces are right-angled triangles. 4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, a tetrahedron with vertices ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 ) is right-faced if and only if there exist four distinct real numbers ( c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 ) such that the edges ( A_jA_k ) have lengths ( A_jA_k = sqrt{|c_j - c_k|} ) for ( 1 leq j < k leq 4 ).

This is also a power of (2) higher than (3), thus making it divisible by (8). Therefore, the sum (2^{5^{2^{5^{*}}}} + 4^{5^{4^{5^{*}}}}) is divisible by (8). 2. **Divisibility by (251)**: Notice that we have the numbers (2) and (4) raised to very large powers. We will use properties of modular arithmetic. - First, observe that (2^8 = 256 equiv 5 pmod{251}). - Consequently, (2^{25} equiv 2 cdot (2^8)^3 equiv 2 cdot 5^3 = 2 cdot 125 = 250 equiv -1 pmod{251}). Consider the exponents in our problem: - For (2^{5^{2^{5^{*}}}}), suppose the exponent (5^{2^{5^{*}}} = k). Then, (k) is an odd multiple of (25) (since (2^{x}) is always even, raising (5^{even}) is still a power of (5)), i.e., (k = 25u) where (u) is odd. Therefore, [ 2^{25u} equiv (2^{25})^u equiv (-1)^u pmod{251}. ] - For (4^{5^{4^{5^{*}}}}), let the exponent (5^{4^{5^{*}}} = m). This is again a multiple of (25), i.e., (m = 25v). Thus, [ 4^{25v} = (2^2)^{25v} = 2^{50v} equiv (2^{50})^v. ] Notice that (2^{50} = (2^{25})^2 equiv (-1)^2 = 1 pmod{251}). Hence, [ 4^{25v} equiv 1^v = 1 pmod{251}. ] Summing these two results yields: [ (-1)^u + 1^v = 0 pmod{251} ] since (u) is odd, ((-1)^u = -1), and adding (1) gives zero. Conclusion: The sum (2^{5^{2^{5^{*}}}} + 4^{5^{4^{5^{*}}}}) is divisible by both (8) and (251). Given that (2008 = 8 cdot 251), we can conclude that: [ 2^{5^{2^{5^{*}}}} + 4^{5^{4^{5^{*}}}} equiv 0 pmod{2008} ] Therefore, the statement is proved.

Therefore, we calculate the maximum possible value of M as follows: [ 2M leq 5 times 1 + 5 times 3 = 20 implies M leq 10. ] 3. **Five 1s in three columns:** The maximum number in these three columns can be at most 3. Therefore, we calculate the maximum possible value of M as follows: [ 3M leq 5 times 1 + 5 times 2 + 5 times 3 = 30 implies M leq 10. ] 4. **Five 1s in at least four columns:** This scenario is not possible without violating the condition that the absolute difference between any two numbers in the same column does not exceed 2, as at least one of the columns would need to contain a number greater than 3. Given these analyses, we conclude that the maximum value of M is 10, and the example grid provided demonstrates that M can indeed be 10.

Since a and b working together can do ( frac{1}{12} ) of the work in one day, and a alone can do ( frac{1}{20} ) of the work in one day, the work done by b alone in one day would be the difference between these two rates: ( frac{1}{12} - frac{1}{20} = frac{1}{x} ) To find the common denominator and subtract the fractions, we get: ( frac{5}{60} - frac{3}{60} = frac{1}{x} ) ( frac{2}{60} = frac{1}{x} ) Simplify the fraction on the left side: ( frac{1}{30} = frac{1}{x} ) This means that b alone can complete the work in boxed{30} days."},{"prompt":"a mathematics competition, four problems were given. The first problem was solved by 85% of the participants, the second by 80%, the third by 75%, and the fourth by 70%. What is the minimum percentage of participants who solved all the problems?","completion":"In this problem, it is stated that: - 85% of participants solved the first problem. - 80% solved the second problem. - 75% solved the third problem. - 70% solved the fourth problem. We are required to determine the minimum percentage of participants who solved all four problems. Let's approach this problem step-by-step: 1. **Calculate the Complementary Percentages**: The complementary percentage provides the percentage of participants who did not solve each problem: - Percentage who did not solve the first problem: ( 100% - 85% = 15% ) - Percentage who did not solve the second problem: ( 100% - 80% = 20% ) - Percentage who did not solve the third problem: ( 100% - 75% = 25% ) - Percentage who did not solve the fourth problem: ( 100% - 70% = 30% ) 2. **Sum of Non-Solving Percentages**: To find the maximum possible percentage of participants who did not solve at least one problem, we sum the complementary percentages: [ 15% + 20% + 25% + 30% = 90% ] 3. **Maximum Percentage of Participants Who Did Not Solve All Problems**: The calculated sum above implies that up to 90% of participants may have failed to solve at least one problem. Consequently, the minimum percentage of participants who solved all problems is: [ 100% - 90% = 10% ] 4. **Verification**: We should verify if it is feasible that only 10% of the participants solved all four problems. If 10% solved all problems, it implies that 90% did not solve one or more problems. For this scenario to be possible, no participant should fail at more than one problem. Here is a possible distribution example for 100 participants: - 30 participants solved the first three problems but not the fourth. - 25 participants solved the first, second, and fourth problems, but not the third. - 20 participants solved the first, third, and fourth problems, but not the second. - 15 participants solved the second, third, and fourth problems, but not the first. - 10 participants solved all four problems. Adding these: [ 30 + 25 + 20 + 15 + 10 = 100 ] This configuration complies with the problem statement and supports that exactly 10% of participants solved all four problems. **Conclusion**: At least 10% of participants solved all four problems.

Let [ S=p(1)+p(2)+p(3)+cdots+p(999). ] What is the largest prime factor of S ?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to find the sum ( S ) of the products of the non-zero digits of all numbers from 1 to 999. For a number ( n ), ( p(n) ) is defined as the product of its non-zero digits. 2. **Breaking Down the Problem:** We can consider the numbers from 1 to 999 as three-digit numbers by padding with leading zeros if necessary. For example, 5 can be considered as 005. 3. **Calculating ( p(n) ) for Each Digit:** - For a single-digit number ( n ), ( p(n) = n ). - For a two-digit number ( n = 10a + b ), ( p(n) = a cdot b ) if ( a neq 0 ) and ( b neq 0 ). - For a three-digit number ( n = 100a + 10b + c ), ( p(n) = a cdot b cdot c ) if ( a, b, c neq 0 ). 4. **Summing ( p(n) ) for All Numbers from 1 to 999:** We need to consider the contribution of each digit position (hundreds, tens, and units) separately. 5. **Contribution of Each Digit Position:** - Each digit from 1 to 9 appears in each position (hundreds, tens, units) exactly 100 times in the range from 1 to 999. - The sum of the non-zero digits from 1 to 9 is ( 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 9 = 45 ). 6. **Calculating the Total Sum:** - For each digit position, the sum of the products of the non-zero digits is ( 45 ) (since each digit from 1 to 9 appears 100 times). - Therefore, the total sum for each position is ( 45 times 100 = 4500 ). 7. **Combining the Contributions:** - Since there are three positions (hundreds, tens, units), the total sum ( S ) is ( 4500 + 4500 + 4500 = 13500 ). 8. **Correcting the Calculation:** - We need to consider the product of the non-zero digits for each number. For example, for 105, ( p(105) = 1 times 5 = 5 ). - The correct approach is to consider the product of the sums of the non-zero digits for each position. 9. **Revisiting the Calculation:** - The sum of the products of the non-zero digits for each position is ( (1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 9) = 46 ). - Therefore, the total sum ( S ) is ( 46^3 ). 10. **Final Calculation:** [ S = 46^3 = 46 times 46 times 46 = 97336 ] 11. **Finding the Largest Prime Factor:** - We need to find the prime factors of 97336. - The prime factorization of 97336 is ( 2^3 times 11567 ). - The largest prime factor is 11567.

The next largest power of 3 is 3^4 = 81, subtracting this gives 102 - 81 = 21. Then, 3^3 = 27 is greater than 21, so we move to 3^2 = 9, and 21 - 9 = 12. Another 3^2 = 9 fits into 12, so 12 - 9 = 3. Finally, 3^1 = 3 fits exactly. So, 345_{10} = 1cdot3^5 + 1cdot3^4 + 0cdot3^3 + 2cdot3^2 + 0cdot3^1 + 1cdot3^0 = 110201_3.

Since p vee q is true, at least one of p or q must be true. This means either A gets first place or B gets second place, or both. 2.

Therefore, we can conclude that exactly one of p or q is true, but not both. 3. The proposition (neg q) wedge r being true implies two things: q is false (B does not get second place), and r is true (C gets third place). 4. From the information above, since q is false, and we know one of p or q must be true (from step 1), it follows that p must be true. This means A gets first place. 5.

We are given that the HCF of 136, 144, and x is 8, and the LCM is (2^4 * 3^2 * 17 * 7).

If all three pumps begin pumping at their respective constant rates at the same time, how many hours would it take to fill the empty tank?","completion":"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of rates. Each pump has a rate at which it fills the tank, and we can add these rates together to find the combined rate when all three pumps are working together. Let's define the rates of the pumps as follows: - The small pump fills the tank in 4 hours, so its rate is 1/4 of the tank per hour. - The larger pump fills the tank in 0.5 hours (half an hour), so its rate is 1/0.5 or 2 tanks per hour. - The medium-sized pump fills the tank in 2 hours, so its rate is 1/2 of the tank per hour. Now, let's add these rates together to find the combined rate: Combined rate = (1/4) + 2 + (1/2) = (1/4) + (4/2) + (1/2) = (1/4) + 2 + (1/2) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The smallest common denominator for 4 and 2 is 4. So we convert the rates to have the same denominator: Combined rate = (1/4) + (8/4) + (2/4) = (1 + 8 + 2) / 4 = 11/4 The combined rate of all three pumps working together is 11/4 tanks per hour. This means they fill 11/4 of the tank in one hour. To find out how long it takes to fill one whole tank, we set up the equation: (11/4) * time = 1 tank Now we solve for time: time = 1 / (11/4) time = 1 * (4/11) time = 4/11 hours So, it would take 4/11 hours to fill the tank with all three pumps working together. To convert this to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): time in minutes = (4/11) * 60 time in minutes = 240/11 time in minutes ≈ 21.82 minutes Therefore, it would take approximately boxed{21.82} minutes to fill the empty tank with all three pumps working together."},{"prompt":"Given the universal set U={x|5leqslant xleqslant 3}, A={x|5leqslant x < 1}, B={x|1leqslant x < 1}, (1) Find {{C}_{U}}A, Acap({{C}_{U}}B); (2) If C={x|1aleqslant xleqslant 2a+1}, and Csubseteq A, find the range of the real number a.","completion":"Solution: (1) Since the universal set U={x|-5leqslant xleqslant 3}, A={x|-5leqslant x < -1}, B={x|-1leqslant x < 1}, thus {{C}_{U}}A = {x|-1leqslant xleqslant 3}, {{C}_{U}}B = {x|-5leqslant x < -1} or 1leqslant xleqslant 3}, therefore Acap({{C}_{U}}B) = {x|-5leqslant x < -1}; (2) Since C={x|1-aleqslant xleqslant 2a+1}, when 1-a > 2a+1, i.e., a < 0, C=phi satisfies Csubseteq A, when 1-aleqslant 2a+1, i.e., ageqslant 0, Cneq phi, from Csubseteq A, we get -5leqslant 1-aleqslant 2a+1leqslant -1, in this case, there is no value of a that satisfies the condition.

After adding the water, the problem states that water makes up 25% of the new mixture.

Point (M) lies on the diagonal (BD): - The projection of point (M) onto (AC) will also fall within the segment (AO) because (M) is situated along the line segment (BD), and both (B) and (D) projections lie within (AO). 5. To show that (AM < MC): - Observe that the projection of point (M), say (P), lies within the sub-segment (AO). This implies that the distance (AP) (projection of (AM)) is smaller than the distance (PC) (projection of (MC)), as (O) is the midpoint of (AC) and hence (AP < PO). 6.

Step 1: Analyze the impact of the first move Gabriel begins and can select any number x in [0, n]. Opting for (x = frac{n}{2}) splits the interval into two equal halves: [0, frac{n}{2}] and [frac{n}{2}, n]. Choosing the center maximizes the distances to the borders of the interval and limits the immediate viable choices for Nora. Step 2: Consider Nora's response Nora then needs to choose a number at least two units away from (x=frac{n}{2}). Thus, her available choices shrink to the segments [0, frac{n}{2} - 2] and [frac{n}{2} + 2, n] assuming (n geq 7). Each segment length is (n/2 - 2).

Considering the reduction pace, determining whether Gabriel can force the intervals to close in a way that ensures Nora encounters the unsolvable turn first is crucial.

The player who takes the last stones wins. How should one play to win?","completion":"The problem involves a game between two players with a pile of 100 stones. Players take turns to take 1, 2, 3, or 5 stones from the pile. The winner is the player who takes the last stone(s). The task is to determine the winning strategy. The game relies on creating positions that are advantageous (i.e., winnable) and disadvantageous (i.e., not winnable) for each player. A key strategic observation is that the second player can ensure a win by maintaining the pile at a number of stones that is a multiple of 4 after each of their moves. Here’s a detailed step-by-step solution to the problem: 1. **Objective of the Second Player:** The second player aims to always leave a multiple of 4 stones in the pile after their turn. This is because if the first player faces a multiple of 4 stones, no matter how many stones they take (1, 2, 3, or 5), the second player can always take enough stones to return the pile to a multiple of 4. 2. **Initial Move Analysis:** - When starting with 100 stones (not a multiple of 4), the first player's move can be analyzed based on the number they choose to take: - If the first player takes 1 stone: (100 - 1 = 99) stones remain. - If the first player takes 2 stones: (100 - 2 = 98) stones remain. - If the first player takes 3 stones: (100 - 3 = 97) stones remain. - If the first player takes 5 stones: (100 - 5 = 95) stones remain. 3. **Second Player Strategy:** The second player then makes the following moves: - If 99 stones remain (after the first player took 1 stone), the second player should take 3 stones: (99 - 3 = 96) stones (a multiple of 4). - If 98 stones remain (after the first player took 2 stones), the second player should take 2 stones: (98 - 2 = 96) stones (a multiple of 4). - If 97 stones remain (after the first player took 3 stones), the second player should take 1 stone: (97 - 1 = 96) stones (a multiple of 4). - If 95 stones remain (after the first player took 5 stones), the second player should take 3 stones: (95 - 3 = 92) stones (a multiple of 4). 4. **Inductive Step:** By maintaining this strategy, no matter the remaining multiple of 4 after the second player’s turn, the first player’s turn will again result in a non-multiple of 4, and the second player will always follow the pattern to bring it back to the next multiple of 4. This scenario forces the first player into never being able to pick the last stone(s). 5. **Final Position:** The final sequence falls into a pattern where ranges like (4, 8, 12, ...) will eventually reduce to the last critical moves such as (1, 2, 3, 5) before the last stone, ensuring the second player always finishing the game successfully by taking the last stone when the multiple of 4 have been exhausted to zero. Therefore, the second player wins by always making the pile reduced to a multiple of 4 stones after every move. # Conclusion Based on this strategy and logical conclusions, the second player has a guaranteed winning strategy if they play optimally. Therefore, the correct final answer is: [boxed{text{Second player wins}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the original graph of y = f(x) as described, which of the following graphs corresponds to the function y = f(x 2) + 1?

Horizontal shift (right by 2 units): Move each point of the graph (x, f(x)) to (x + 2, f(x)). 2. Vertical shift (up by 1 unit): Move each now horizontally-shifted point (x+2, f(x)) to (x+2, f(x)+1).

For Group B, which includes numbers 1 to 10, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, 5 and 6, which is frac{5+6}{2} = 5.5.

A value of r=-0.88 indicates a strong negative correlation, not a weak correlation. The common interpretation is that |r| geqslant 0.75 represents a strong correlation. Thus, proposition ② is incorrect because it misinterprets the strength of the correlation. **Proposition ③**: The observed value of chi^{2} from the data is 4.567.

Solving this equation gives us: [ k^{2}-1=0 implies k^{2}=1 implies k=pm1. ] However, for it to be in one variable, the coefficient of x must also be zero when k^{2}-1=0. This happens when k+1=0, leading to: [ k+1=0 implies k=-1. ] Therefore, when k=-1, the equation becomes a linear equation in one variable. 2. **Linear Equation in Two Variables:** Again, for the equation to be linear, we need k^{2}-1=0. As derived above, this gives k=pm1. However, for the equation to remain in two variables, the coefficient of x should not be zero when k^{2}-1=0, which excludes k=-1 since k+1neq 0.

Calculate the sides and angles.","completion":"Given that the sides of a triangle are (a, a+1, a+2), and the smallest angle is half the largest angle. We need to find the sides and angles of the triangle. 1. Let the sides of the triangle be denoted as (a, a+1, a+2), where (a) is the smallest side. 2. Denote the angles opposite these sides as (alpha, beta, 2alpha), respectively. 3. According to the sine rule (Law of Sines), we have: [ frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{a+2}{sin 2alpha} ] 4. Using the double-angle identity, (sin 2alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha), we can rewrite the equation as: [ frac{a}{sin alpha} = frac{a+2}{2 sin alpha cos alpha} ] 5. Simplifying the equation, we get: [ a = frac{a+2}{2 cos alpha} ] 6. This implies: [ 2a cos alpha = a+2 ] [ cos alpha = frac{a+2}{2a} ] 7. Using the Law of Cosines, we express (cos alpha) in terms of the sides of the triangle: [ a^2 = (a+1)^2 + (a+2)^2 - 2(a+1)(a+2) cos alpha ] 8. Simplifying, we get: [ a^2 = a^2 + 2a + 1 + a^2 + 4a + 4 -2(a^2 + 3a + 2) cos alpha ] 9. Cancelling common terms and rearranging: [ 0 = 6a + 5 - 2(a^2 + 3a + 2) cos alpha ] [ 2(a^2 + 3a + 2) cos alpha = 6a + 5 ] 10. Dividing by 2: [ (a^2 + 3a + 2) cos alpha = 3a + frac{5}{2} ] 11. Substitute (cos alpha = frac{a + 2}{2a}): [ (a^2 + 3a + 2) frac{a+2}{2a} = 3a + frac{5}{2} ] 12. Multiplying both sides by (2a): [ (a^2 + 3a + 2)(a+2) = (6a^2 + 5a) ] 13. Expanding the left side: [ a^3 + 2a^2 + 3a^2 + 6a + 2a + 4 = 6a^2 + 5a ] 14. Simplifying: [ a^3 + 5a^2 + 8a + 4 = 6a^2 + 5a ] [ a^3 - a^2 + 3a + 4 = 0 ] 15. Solving this polynomial equation, we find that (a = 4). 16. Therefore, the sides of the triangle are: [ 4, 5, 6 ] 17. Now, calculate the angles of the triangle by using (cos alpha): [ cos alpha = frac{4 + 2}{2 cdot 4} = frac{6}{8} = frac{3}{4} ] 18.

This leads to a contradiction because a knight cannot be a liar. - Let's assume (A) is a liar: - As a liar, (A) lies, so the statement (P lor Q) must be false. - We already know (Q) is false. - Since both (Q) is false and the entire statement (P lor Q) is false, (P) must also be false to keep (P lor Q) false. - If (P) is false, it means (A) is not a liar.

The product of the number of stones in these two piles is recorded on a blackboard. 1. **Definition of Capacity:** The capacity of a pile with (m) stones is defined as: [ C(m) = frac{m(m-1)}{2} ] 2. **Capacity Calculation for Two Piles:** When a pile of (a + b) stones is split into two piles with (a) stones and (b) stones respectively, the total capacity before the split is: [ C(a+b) = frac{(a+b)(a+b-1)}{2} ] 3. **Capacity Conservation:** After the split, the total capacity of the system includes the capacities of the two piles and the product recorded on the blackboard: [ C(a+b) = C(a) + C(b) + ab ] which explicitly is: [ frac{(a+b)(a+b-1)}{2} = frac{a(a-1)}{2} + frac{b(b-1)}{2} + ab ] 4. **Equivalence Before and After the Operation:** This equation shows that the total \\"capacity\\" of the system remains unchanged through each operation, with the term (ab) (the product recorded on the blackboard) making up the difference. 5. **Final Distribution of Stones:** As the operations continue until each pile is reduced to a single stone, the final capacity of each pile of one stone is: [ C(1) = frac{1 cdot (1-1)}{2} = 0 ] Therefore, the sum of the capacities of all individual piles with just one stone is zero. 6. **Initial and Final Capacities Relationship:** Since the capacity is conserved and the final capacity of each stone is zero, the total sum on the blackboard must be equal to the initial capacity of the initial pile of 2019 stones. 7. **Initial Capacity Calculation:** The initial capacity of the pile with 2019 stones is: [ C(2019) = frac{2019 times 2018}{2} = frac{2019 cdot 2018}{2} ] 8. **Final Answer:** So, the total sum of the numbers written on the blackboard, which equals the initial capacity, is: [ boxed{2037171} ]"},{"prompt":"Simplify first, then find the value: x(sqrt{6}x)+ (x+sqrt{5})(xsqrt{5}), where x=sqrt{6}sqrt{2}.","completion":"To simplify the given expression and then find its value for x=sqrt{6}-sqrt{2}, we proceed as follows: First, we simplify the given expression: begin{align*} x(sqrt{6}-x)+ (x+sqrt{5})(x-sqrt{5}) &= sqrt{6}x -

The coordinates of the foci are F_1(-c, 0) and F_2(c, 0). Since PF_1 is perpendicular to PF_2, the product of their slopes is -1. Denoting the slopes of PF_1 and PF_2 by k_{PF_1} and k_{PF_2} respectively, we have: k_{PF_1} cdot k_{PF_2} = -1. For PF_1, the slope can be written as: k_{PF_1} = frac{4}{3 + c}. For PF_2, the slope is: k_{PF_2} = frac{4}{3 - c}. Setting their product equal to -1, we have: frac{4}{3 + c} cdot frac{4}{3 - c} = -1. Solving this equation yields c = 5. Since the distance between the foci (2c) and the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes (a and b) satisfy the equation a^2 - b^2 = c^2, we can write: a^2 - b^2 = 25. Using the fact that point P(3, 4) lies on the ellipse, we can substitute into the ellipse's equation: frac{9}{a^2} + frac{16}{b^2} = 1.

Let's denote the side lengths of the rectangular prism as a, b, and c. According to the Pythagorean theorem, the lengths of the external diagonals can be represented as sqrt{a^2 + b^2}, sqrt{b^2 + c^2}, and sqrt{a^2 + c^2}. Given this, we can square these expressions to avoid dealing with square roots, resulting in a^2 + b^2, b^2 + c^2, and a^2 + c^2. Since a, b, and c are all positive lengths (side lengths of a prism cannot be negative), we can infer that the sum of any two of these squared diagonal lengths must be greater than the square of the third diagonal length. This is because adding any positive quantity to a number will increase its value. For instance, if we take (a^2 + b^2) + (b^2 + c^2), this sum equals (a^2 + c^2) + 2b^2, which is strictly greater than a^2 + c^2 since 2b^2 > 0. To apply this logic to our problem, we need to check each set of external diagonal lengths given in the options to see if the sum of the squares of the two smaller numbers is greater than the square of the largest number. This will help us identify any set that could not represent the lengths of the external diagonals of a right regular prism. For option (B) {4,5,7}, we calculate the squares and sum as follows: - Squaring the numbers: 4^2 = 16, 5^2 = 25, 7^2 = 49. - Adding the squares of the two smaller numbers: 16 + 25 = 41. - Comparing this sum to the square of the largest number: 41 < 49. This comparison shows that the sum of the squares of the two smaller numbers (41) is not greater than the square of the largest number (49), which violates the condition derived from the Pythagorean theorem for the lengths of the external diagonals of a right regular prism.

Prove that P_1P_2+P_2P_3+cdots +P_kP_{k+1}geqslant frac{k^3+k}{2} holds for every integer k with 1leqslant kleqslant p . *Proposed by Ander Lamaison Vidarte, Berlin Mathematical School, Berlin*","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We are given a convex polygon with (pq) sides, where (p) and (q) are prime numbers and (p < q). All angles in the polygon are equal, and the side lengths are distinct positive integers. We need to prove that for any integer (k) with (1 leq k leq p), the sum of (k) consecutive side lengths is at least (frac{k^3 + k}{2}). 2. **Equiangular Condition:** Let the side lengths be (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{pq-1}). The equiangular condition implies: [ a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + cdots + a_{pq-1} x^{pq-1} = 0 ] where (x = e^{2pi i / pq}) is a primitive (pq)-th root of unity. 3. **Array Representation:** We can arrange the side lengths (a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{pq-1}) in a (p times q) array. For example, for (p = 5) and (q = 7), the array looks like: [ begin{array}{ccccccc} a_0 & a_1 & a_2 & a_3 & a_4 & a_5 & a_6 a_7 & a_8 & a_9 & a_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} a_{14} & a_{15} & a_{16} & a_{17} & a_{18} & a_{19} & a_{20} a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24} & a_{25} & a_{26} & a_{27} a_{28} & a_{29} & a_{30} & a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{34} end{array} ] 4. **Flat Array Condition:** The array is called *flat* if the sum of the side lengths weighted by powers of (x) equals zero. This condition is preserved if we add or subtract the same value from all elements in any row or column. 5. **Main Claim:** In any rectangle within the array, the sum of the elements in opposite corners is equal. Formally, for any rectangle with corners (a, b, c, d), we have: [ a + c = b + d ] 6. **Proof of the Main Claim:** - We can increment or decrement every entry in a row or column by the same amount without changing the flatness of the array. - This operation preserves the sum (a + c - b - d) for any rectangle. - By performing these operations, we can make the first row and column all zeros. - Since the number of zeros equals the nullity of the map, the entire array becomes zero, preserving the condition (a + c = b + d). 7. **Corollary:** There exist integers (r_0, r_1, ldots, r_{p-1}) and (s_0, s_1, ldots, s_{q-1}) such that: [ a_k = r_k + s_k ] for all (k), where indices are taken modulo (pq), (p), and (q) respectively. 8. **Summing (k) Consecutive Side Lengths:** For (1 leq k leq p), consider the sum of (k) consecutive side lengths: [ a_0 + a_1 + cdots + a_{k-1} = r_0 + r_1 + cdots + r_{k-1} + s_0 + s_1 + cdots + s_{k-1} ] The (k times k) subarray contains (k^2) distinct positive integers.

We want to rearrange the coins in the correct order of their weights, but we do not have any extra space, so we can only swap two coins (not necessarily adjacent) in each step. Prove that during this rearrangement process, at some step, we had to swap a gold coin with a silver coin.","completion":"To address the problem of proving that we must exchange an odd number of steps between a gold and a silver coin, we will delve into the details utilizing the proposed methods. First Method 1. **Initial Coloring of Coins**: Let's denote the coins sequentially from 1 to k. We will color the positions as follows: - If a coin in position i is silver, color it white. - If a coin in position i is gold, color it yellow. 2. **Initial Positioning**: According to the problem, the heaviest coin (say gold) is mistakenly placed in the last position, while the second heaviest is placed first, and so forth. 3. **Exchange Effects on Coloring**: - If we exchange two coins of the same type (both gold or both silver), their positions' colors do not change. - If we exchange two coins of different types (one gold and one silver), their positions' colors change. 4. **Proof by Initialization**: Given the starting arrangement and the fact that there are both gold and silver coins in the mix: - Assume there exists at least one pair of consecutive positions (i, i+1), where one position contains a gold coin, and the other contains a silver coin (1 leq i < k). - At the end, each initial position i that housed a coin has its coin advanced to the (i+1)-th position. - Consequently, the adjacency previously noted changes its composition according to the exchange rules until the positions are correctly sorted. 5. **Necessary Condition for Sorting**: Given the rules: - If numbers i and (i+1) changed in color, we had exchanged a gold for a silver coin or vice versa. Since reordering necessitates appropriate positioning where the last coin is sorted by swapping with an adjacent lighter coin eventually, which would iterate until the entire sequence is sorted, there must be at least one instance where a gold coins exchanges places with a silver coin. Thus, we conclude that during the sorting process, it is mandatory to exchange a gold and a silver coin. blacksquare Second Method: 1. **Initial Summation of Positions**: Let S represent the sum of the positions of the silver coins initially: [ S = sum (text{positions of silver coins}) ] 2. **Final Summation of Positions**: - Since each coin should move exactly one step higher to maintain their relative heavier arrangement, our final sum transitions from S to S + k. Therefore: [ text{Final sum } = S + k ] 3. **Exchange Impact on Summation**: - If we only exchanged silver for silver and gold for gold, the sum S would not change because same-type coin exchanges do not alter individual sums. However, since the sum transforms, this rigidity implies some steps involved different coin types. 4. **Conclusion based on Summation Proof**: Given the necessary alteration made to the summation and the rules defined, it is an evident indication that silver must have exchanged places with a gold coin, enforcing the problem's thesis. Thus, we confirm that an interchange between different coin-type (gold and silver) is essential to achieve the complete reordering. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Michael runs 8 laps on the school track, each lap being 400 meters.

Since the man in the slower train observes the faster train passing by, we are dealing with the relative speed between the two trains. The length of the faster train is 75.006 meters, and it takes 15 seconds to pass the man in the slower train completely. To find the relative speed, we can use the formula: Relative speed = Distance / Time The distance is the length of the faster train, which is 75.006 meters, and the time is 15 seconds. Relative speed = 75.006 meters / 15 seconds Relative speed = 5.0004 meters per second Now, we need to convert this relative speed from meters per second to kilometers per hour to compare it with the given speed of the faster train (50 kmph). To convert meters per second to kilometers per hour, we multiply by 3.6 (since 1 m/s is equivalent to 3.6 km/h): Relative speed in km/h = 5.0004 m/s * 3.6 km/h per m/s Relative speed in km/h = 18.00144 km/h This relative speed is the difference in speed between the faster train and the slower train. Since we know the speed of the faster train is 50 kmph, we can find the speed of the slower train by subtracting the relative speed from the speed of the faster train: Speed of slower train = Speed of faster train - Relative speed Speed of slower train = 50 kmph - 18.00144 km/h Speed of slower train ≈ 31.99856 km/h Therefore, the speed of the slower train is approximately boxed{31.99856} km/h."},{"prompt":"A conference has 500 delegates, and each delegate knows more than 400 other delegates.

This gives us: [ frac{1}{x}+frac{9}{y} = frac{1}{2}(x+y)left(frac{1}{x}+frac{9}{y}right) = frac{1}{2}left(frac{y}{x}+frac{9x}{y}+10right) ] 3. **Applying AM-GM Inequality**: The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality states that for non-negative numbers a and b, frac{a+b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}, with equality if and only if a=b. Applying this to frac{y}{x} and frac{9x}{y} gives us: [ frac{1}{2}left(frac{y}{x}+frac{9x}{y}+10right) geq frac{1}{2}left(2sqrt{frac{y}{x} cdot frac{9x}{y}}+10right) = frac{1}{2}(2sqrt{9}+10) = 8 ] 4. **Finding Conditions for Equality**: The AM-GM inequality tells us that equality occurs when frac{y}{x} = frac{9x}{y}. Solving this equation, we find that x=frac{1}{2} and y=frac{3}{2} satisfy both the equality condition and the original equation x+y=2. 5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the minimum value of frac{1}{x}+frac{9}{y}, given the constraints, is boxed{8}, achieved when x=frac{1}{2} and y=frac{3}{2}."},{"prompt":"Two triangles ABC and DEF have the same incircle. If a circle passes through A,B,C,D,E prove that it also passes through F .","completion":"1. **Introduction to Poncelet's Theorem**: The problem is a direct application of Poncelet's Theorem, which states that if two triangles share the same incircle, then the vertices of these triangles lie on a common conic section. 2. **Contact Triangles**: Let triangle A_1B_1C_1 and triangle D_1E_1F_1 be the contact triangles of triangle ABC and triangle DEF, respectively, with the common incircle omega. The contact triangle of a given triangle is formed by the points where the incircle touches the sides of the triangle. 3. **Midpoints of Contact Points**: Define P_{XY} as the midpoint of the segment joining the contact points X_1 and Y_1, where X, Y in {A, B, C, D, E, F}. 4. **Cross Ratio Invariance**: We use the property of cross ratios and the fact that they are preserved under projective transformations. Consider the cross ratio: [ C(DE, AB) overset{C}{=} (D, E; CA cap DE, CB cap DE) ] This cross ratio is preserved under the projective transformation induced by the incircle omega: [ (D, E; CA cap DE, CB cap DE) overset{I}{=} (P_{FD}, P_{FE}; P_{FB}, P_{FA}) ] Here, I is the incenter of the triangles. 5. **Cross Ratio with Contact Points**: The cross ratio involving the contact points can be written as: [ (P_{FD}, P_{FE}; P_{FB}, P_{FA}) overset{F_1}{=} (D_1, E_1; B_1, A_1) ] This shows that the cross ratio of the points D, E, A, B is the same as the cross ratio of the points D_1, E_1, B_1, A_1. 6. **Conclusion from Cross Ratio**: Since the cross ratio is invariant, we have: [ C(DE, AB) = F(DE, AB) ] This implies that the points A, B, C, D, E, F lie on a common conic. 7. **Uniqueness of Conic through Five Points**: A non-degenerate conic is uniquely determined by five points. Since A, B, C, D, E lie on a conic, and F must also lie on this conic by Poncelet's Theorem, it follows that F lies on the circle passing through A, B, C, D, E.

How many bees did she see in both hives combined on the second day?","completion":"First, let's calculate the increase in the bee population for each hive after one day. For hive A: The increase is 20% of 144 bees. 20% of 144 = 0.20 * 144 = 28.8 bees Since the number of bees can't be a fraction, we'll round to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round up because you can't have a fraction of a bee. So, the increase is approximately 29 bees. The new population in hive A after one day is: 144 bees + 29 bees = 173 bees For hive B: The increase is 20% of 172 bees. 20% of 172 = 0.20 * 172 = 34.4 bees Again, rounding to the nearest whole number, we'll round up to 35 bees.

For hive A on the second day: The increase is 20% of 173 bees. 20% of 173 = 0.20 * 173 = 34.6 bees Rounding up, we get an increase of approximately 35 bees. The population in hive A on the second day is: 173 bees + 35 bees = 208 bees For hive B on the second day: The increase is 20% of 207 bees. 20% of 207 = 0.20 * 207 = 41.4 bees Rounding up, we get an increase of approximately 41 bees.

Is it possible for the goal difference in such table to be strictly increasing from the top to the bottom? *Proposed by Abolfazl Asadi*","completion":"1. **Assume that such a configuration is possible.** - We need to check if the goal difference can be strictly increasing from the top to the bottom of the table. 2. **Points Calculation:** - Since there are no draws, each match results in either a win or a loss. - If a team wins ( x ) matches, it loses ( 2020 - 1 - x ) matches (since each team plays 2019 matches in total). - The total points for a team that wins ( x ) matches is ( 3x ) (since each win gives 3 points). 3. **Unique Number of Wins:** - No two teams can have the same number of wins because then their points would be the same, and the ordering by goal difference would not satisfy the strictly increasing condition. - Therefore, the team that finishes in the ( k )-th place wins exactly ( 2020 - k ) matches. 4. **Goal Difference Analysis:** - The team that finishes in the last place (2020th place) wins 0 matches and loses all 2019 matches. - This team’s goal difference is negative because it lost all its matches. - For the goal difference to be strictly increasing, the goal difference of every team must be less than the team above it in the table. 5. **Contradiction:** - If the worst team has a negative goal difference, then the team just above it must have a goal difference that is still negative but less negative (closer to zero). - This pattern continues up the table, implying that all teams have negative goal differences. - However, this is impossible because the top team, which wins the most matches, should have a positive goal difference. 6. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, it is not possible for the goal difference to be strictly increasing from the top to the bottom of the table.

Since B is the upper vertex, its coordinates are (0, b). For any point P(x_0, y_0) on the ellipse, we have the equation of the ellipse as frac{x_0^2}{a^2} + frac{y_0^2}{b^2} = 1. This leads to the expression for x_0^2 as x_0^2 = a^2left(1 - frac{y_0^2}{b^2}right). Given that the distance |PB| leqslant 2b, we calculate |PB|^2 as follows: begin{align*} |PB|^2 &= x_0^2 + (y_0 - b)^2 &= a^2left(1 - frac{y_0^2}{b^2}right) + (y_0 - b)^2 &= a^2 - frac{a^2}{b^2}y_0^2 + y_0^2 - 2by_0 + b^2 &= a^2 + b^2 - 2by_0 + left(1 - frac{a^2}{b^2}right)y_0^2 &= a^2 + b^2 - 2by_0 - frac{c^2}{b^2}y_0^2, end{align*} where we used the fact that a^2 = b^2 + c^2 and thus a^2 - b^2 = c^2. The axis of symmetry for |PB|^2 as a function of y_0 is found by setting the derivative with respect to y_0 to zero, which gives y_0 = -frac{b^3}{c^2}. For the condition |PB| leqslant 2b to hold for all points on the ellipse, we need to ensure that the maximum value of |PB|^2 does not exceed (2b)^2 = 4b^2. When -frac{b^3}{c^2} leqslant -b, or equivalently b geqslant c, the maximum value of |PB|^2 occurs at y_0 = -b. Substituting y_0 = -b into our expression for |PB|^2 and setting it equal to 4b^2, we find that the condition simplifies to b^2 geqslant c^2, or a^2 - c^2 geqslant c^2. This gives us the inequality for the eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} leqslant frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Considering the range of e, we know that 0 < e < 1 for an ellipse, so combining this with our derived inequality, we find that the range of e is (0, frac{sqrt{2}}{2}].

Since each sweater takes 4 balls of yarn and each ball costs 6, the cost for the yarn for one sweater is: 4 balls/sweater * 6/ball = 24/sweater Now, let's calculate the total cost of the yarn for all 28 sweaters: 24/sweater * 28 sweaters = 672 Chantal gains 308 in all from selling the 28 sweaters.

From the information given, we know that: 1. 2/5 of all the employees are managers, so M = (2/5)E. 2. There are 200 female managers. 3. 2/5 of all male employees are managers. We need to find the total number of female employees, which we'll denote as Female_E. We know that the total number of employees E is the sum of the number of male employees and the number of female employees, so E = Male_E + Female_E. Since 2/5 of all male employees are managers, we can say that the number of male managers is (2/5)Male_E. The total number of managers is the sum of male managers and female managers, so M = (2/5)Male_E + 200. Now, we can use the first piece of information to express the total number of managers in terms of the total number of employees: M = (2/5)E We can equate the two expressions for M: (2/5)E = (2/5)Male_E + 200 Since we want to find the number of female employees, we need to express Male_E in terms of E and Female_E: Male_E = E - Female_E Substitute Male_E in the equation: (2/5)E = (2/5)(E - Female_E) + 200 Now, let's solve for Female_E: (2/5)E = (2/5)E - (2/5)Female_E + 200 Since (2/5)E on both sides cancels out, we have: 0 = - (2/5)Female_E + 200 Now, let's isolate Female_E: (2/5)Female_E = 200 Multiply both sides by 5/2 to solve for Female_E: Female_E = 200 * (5/2) Female_E = 100 * 5 Female_E = 500 So, the total number of female employees in the company is boxed{500} ."},{"prompt":"Let the universal set be U={1,2,3,4,5}, set M={1,4}, N={2,5}.

The mass ( m ) of the plate can be found by determining its area geometrically. Given that it is an equilateral triangle, the area ( s ) is calculated with the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length ( sqrt{2}a ): [ m = s = frac{(sqrt{2}a)^2 sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{2a^2 sqrt{3}}{4} = frac{a^2 sqrt{3}}{2} ] 2. **Compute Static Moments:** Since the triangle is equilateral and homogeneous, the static moments relative to the coordinate planes ((xy), (yz), (xz)) can be computed. The general expression for the static moment ( M_{ij} ) for the given triangle is: [ M_{xy} = M_{yz} = M_{xz} = iint_{sigma} z , dsigma ] We need to integrate ( z = a - x - y ) over the triangular region defined by ( 0 leq x leq a ) and ( 0 leq y leq a - x ): [ begin{aligned} M_{xy} &= int_{0}^{a} int_{0}^{a-x} (a - x - y) cdot sqrt{3} , dy , dx &= sqrt{3} int_{0}^{a} left( int_{0}^{a-x} (a - x - y) , dy right) dx &= sqrt{3} int_{0}^{a} left[ (a - x)y - frac{y^2}{2} right]_{0}^{a-x} dx &= sqrt{3} int_{0}^{a} left[ (a - x)(a - x) - frac{(a - x)^2}{2} right] dx &= sqrt{3} int_{0}^{a} left( (a - x)^2 - frac{(a - x)^2}{2} right) dx &= sqrt{3} int_{0}^{a} left( frac{(a - x)^2}{2} right) dx &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} int_{0}^{a} (a - x)^2 , dx &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} int_{0}^{a} (a^2 - 2ax + x^2) , dx &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} left[ a^2x - a x^2 + frac{x^3}{3} right]_{0}^{a} &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} left[ a^3 - a^3 + frac{a^3}{3} right] &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{a^3}{3} &= frac{sqrt{3}}{6} a^3 end{aligned} ] Therefore, the static moments are: [ M_{xy} = M_{yz} = M_{xz} = frac{sqrt{3}}{6} a^3 ] 3. **Compute the Centroid Coordinates:** The coordinates of the centroid ( (x_c, y_c, z_c) ) can be found from the symmetry and properties of an equilateral triangle.

We need to prove that lines CK and A'B' are perpendicular. 2. **Step 1**: Since I is the incenter of triangle ABC, it lies on the angle bisectors AA' and BB'. The point K is the reflection of I across AB. Therefore, K is also equidistant from A and B. 3. **Step 2**: Consider the cyclic quadrilateral CBKA. Since K is the reflection of I across AB, K lies on the circumcircle of triangle CBI. This is because the reflection of a point across a line preserves the circumcircle property. 4. **Step 3**: Let CK intersect AB at point F. We need to show that FA'CA is cyclic. Since K is the reflection of I across AB, CK is the reflection of CI across AB. 5. **Step 4**: Since I is the incenter, angle AIC = 90^circ + frac{angle A}{2}. Reflecting I across AB does not change the angle angle AIC. Therefore, angle AKC = 90^circ + frac{angle A}{2}. 6. **Step 5**: Since FA'CA is cyclic, we have angle CA'A = angle CFA = 120^circ - frac{angle A}{2}. This follows from the fact that angle C = 60^circ and the sum of angles in a triangle is 180^circ. 7. **Step 6**: Since A'I = B'I (as I is the incenter), we have angle A'B'I = angle B'A'I = 30^circ. This is because the angle bisectors divide the angles into equal parts. 8. **Step 7**: To prove that CK and A'B' are perpendicular, we need to show that angle (CK, A'B') = 90^circ. Since K is the reflection of I across AB, CK is perpendicular to AB. 9. **Step 8**: Since A'B' is the line segment joining the points where the angle bisectors intersect the opposite sides, and I is the incenter, A'B' is perpendicular to CK. Therefore, we have shown that lines CK and A'B' are perpendicular. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Read the comprehension and answer the questions according to the rules obtained.

This implies that the sequence must also be eventually periodic modulo 8. Consider the sequence modulo 8. If x_n is even and s(n) > 2, then x_{n+1} equiv 1 pmod{8}. Thus, if there exists k > N such that x_k equiv 3, 5, 7 pmod{8}, then s(k-1) leq 2. Since k is in the period, the density of numbers k such that s(k) leq 2 must tend to frac{1}{T}. However, there are at most a + a^2 such numbers less than 10^a. For large enough a, frac{10^a}{T} > a + a^2 + c, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, if x_n is in the period and is odd, then x_n equiv 1 pmod{8}. If x_n equiv 1 pmod{8}, then x_{n+1} equiv 2 pmod{8}, and the period alternates between odd and even. Thus, the period must be 1, 2, 1, 2, dots or 2, 1, 2, 1, dots. - **Possibility 1 (P1):** For n > N, x_n equiv 1 pmod{8} if n is odd and x_n equiv 2 pmod{8} if n is even.

Check n = 10^b + 1 for large b and get a contradiction. Either way, we get a contradiction. Thus, there is no such sequence for 8 mid m. 2. **Step 2: Prove for m neq 2^a cdot b where b mid 511** Since m neq 2^a cdot b where b mid 511, there exists an odd p^k where p^k mid m and p^k nmid 511 (where p is a prime number). If the sequence is periodic modulo m, then it is also periodic modulo p^k. Define A as the set of all residues of the period modulo p^k. First, we show that 2 in A: Set n = 10^a(10^{phi(p^k)-1} + dots + 1) such that n > N. Then, phi(p^k) = s(n), thus x_{n+1} equiv c^{phi(p^k)} + 1 equiv 1, 2 pmod{p^k}. If it is equal to 2, we have 2 in A. Otherwise, x_{n+1} equiv 1 pmod{p^k}, then x_{n+2} equiv 2 pmod{p^k}. Either way, we have 2 in A. Let x_{nT+r} equiv 2 pmod{p^k} for a constant r > N and all n geq 0. By looking at x_{Tn+r+1}, we have 2^{s(nT+r)} equiv 2^{s(r)} pmod{p^k}. Set n rightarrow 10^a cdot n for a very large a.

Thus, putting these in ** and combining, we get that 2^9 equiv 1 pmod{p^k}. But 511 equiv 0 pmod{p^k}, which is a contradiction since p^k does not divide 511.

This statement claims a spermatogonial cell with the genotype AaX^bY can, due to a mishap in chromosome distribution, produce a sperm with the genotype AAaY. This is not possible under normal circumstances as meiosis creates gametes with one set of chromosomes.

There are two types of numbers: odd and even.

Two even numbers and one odd number (Even + Even + Odd = Odd) 2. Three odd numbers (Odd + Odd + Odd = Odd) Since the balls are numbered from 1 to 100, there are 50 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ..., 99) and 50 even numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 100). Let's calculate the probability for each case: Case 1: Two even numbers and one odd number The probability of selecting an even number is 50/100 = 1/2, and the probability of selecting an odd number is also 50/100 = 1/2. The number of ways to arrange two evens and one odd is 3 (EEO, EOE, OEE). So, the probability for this case is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * 3 = 3/8. Case 2: Three odd numbers The probability of selecting an odd number is 1/2 for each draw. So, the probability for this case is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8. Now, we add the probabilities of the two cases to get the total probability of getting an odd sum: Total probability = Probability (Case 1) + Probability (Case 2) Total probability = 3/8 + 1/8 Total probability = 4/8 Total probability = 1/2 Therefore, the probability that the sum of the three numbers on the balls selected will be odd is boxed{1/2} or 50%."},{"prompt":"A sufficient and necessary condition for the inequality 2x^{2}5x3geqslant 0 to hold is ( ).

The manufacturer produces 400 units each month, so the total monthly production cost is 400 * C.

Then from the equation (c=2000((d+1)+(d+1))), it follows that (d+1) and (c) must be of the same color (since (2000((d+1)+(d+1)) = 2000 cdot 2 (d+1) = c)). 3. **Another Formulation**: Alternatively, suppose (c=2000(d+(d+2))). From this, numbers (d), (d+2), and (d+1) must either be of the same color or each of a different color. 4. **Implication for Sequences**: Hence, any three consecutive numbers must be either of the same color or of three different colors. Let's break this into: - Start with 1, 2, 3: - If 1, 2, 3 are of the same color, consider the triplet 2, 3, 4, then 3, 4, 5, and so on. By induction, all numbers will end up being the same color. - Assume now 1 is color (A), 2 is color (B), 3 is color (C). For the sequence to hold: - Considering 2, 3, 4: 4 must be color (A) - Next 3, 4, 5: 5 must be color (B), and so forth. 5. **Mathematical Form Validation**: Consider the general form: - (a = 3k_1 + r_1) - (b = 3k_2 + r_2) - (c = 3k_3 + r_3), where (r_1, r_2, r_3) are the remainders when (a, b, c) are divided by 3. From the equality (2000(a+b)=2000(3k_1 + r_1 + 3k_2 + r_2)=3M-r_1-r_2=c=3k_3+r_3) we see the requirement that (r_1 + r_2 equates r_3). Therefore: - The sums of remainders (r_1, r_2, r_3) must be divisible by 3, implying they must either all be identical, or all distinctly different from one another. 6. **Conclusion**: Finally, the required colorations which satisfy the condition are: - Color all natural numbers the same color. - Color numbers (3k - 2, k in mathbb{N}) color (A), numbers (3k - 1) color (B), and numbers (3k) color (C).

Each unit square consists of vertices at ((i, j)), ((i+1, j)), ((i, j+1)), and ((i+1, j+1)) for some integer (i) and (j). Assign: [ h = mi + nj ] The colors at these vertices will be the same as the colors of the integers: [ h, quad h + m, quad h + n, quad h + m + n ] Suppose that any two of these points are the same color. The differences between any two of these points will be (m), (n), (m + n), or (pm(m - n)), respectively. This gives a direct contradiction to our supposition. 3. Consequently, each unit square on the lattice must have all four vertices in different colors. 4. Next, consider any three adjacent points on any row in the lattice.

Proceed to determine the adjacent colors as per the rule of initial assumption. 5. If we extend the process indefinitely, we will find that this pattern must repeat. But since ( m ) and ( n ) are distinct odd numbers, such a coloring pattern must be periodic with a period of at least 2. 6. To see why, consider: - If three different points in any given row with different colors cannot exist, then each row must be periodic with period 2. - Every subsequent row follows the same period until all rows follow a periodic pattern making the rows periodic with period 2. 7. Suppose all rows indeed have a period of 2.

Since a and b are given as unit vectors, their magnitudes are both 1. Thus, we have: a cdot b = (1)(1) cos(theta) = cos(theta) Now, if a cdot b = 1, it means that cos(theta) = 1. The cosine function equals 1 only when its argument is 0 radians (or a multiple of 2pi radians), meaning that the two vectors have an angle of theta = 0 between them. Therefore, they are pointing in exactly the same direction. Since vectors a and b are both unit vectors and have the same direction when a cdot b = 1, they must also have the same components in all dimensions (because they have the same magnitude and direction). This means that a = b. Thus, \\"a cdot b = 1\\" is a both sufficient and necessary condition for \\"a = b\\", because: - It is sufficient: If a cdot b = 1, then a = b must be true. - It is necessary: If a = b, the only way their dot product can be 1 (since they are unit vectors) is when they are pointing in the same direction.

The domain given is [-2,2b]. For the domain to be symmetric about 0, we require that -2 = -2b and 2b = 2. This implies that b = 1. Therefore, the domain is [-2,2]. 2. **Monotonicity Analysis**: - The function is monotonically increasing on [-2,0]. Given that f(x) is an even function, this implies it is monotonically decreasing on [0,2] because the behavior on the positive side of the domain mirrors the behavior on the negative side. 3. **Inequality Transformation**: - The condition f(x+1) leqslant f(-1) can be transformed using the property of even functions. For even functions, f(x) = f(-x). Therefore, we can rewrite the inequality as f(|x+1|) leqslant f(|-1|) because f(x+1) and f(-1) can be considered as f(|x+1|) and f(|-1|) respectively, due to the even nature of f(x). 4. **Solving the Inequality**: - We derive two conditions from the transformed inequality: - Condition ①: |x+1| geqslant 1. Solving this, we get x geqslant 0 or x leqslant -2. - Condition ②: Since the domain of f(x) is now [-2,2], and we are considering f(x+1), we must ensure x+1 falls within the domain of f(x).

To find the first discount percentage, we need to compare this price to the original price. The original price was 199.99999999999997 (which we can round to 200 for simplicity). The discount amount for the first discount is the difference between the original price and the price after the first discount: Discount Amount = Original Price - Price After First Discount Discount Amount = 200 - 180 Discount Amount = 20 Now we can find the first discount percentage by dividing the discount amount by the original price and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage: First Discount Percentage = (Discount Amount / Original Price) * 100 First Discount Percentage = (20 / 200) * 100 First Discount Percentage = 0.10 * 100 First Discount Percentage = 10% So the first discount percentage is boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"Among the following numbers, the smallest one is: A: 0 B: 2 C: 1 D: sqrt{3}","completion":"To determine the smallest number among the given options, we compare each of them: - Comparing 0 and -2, we have -2 < 0. - Comparing 1 and -2, we have -2 < 1. - To compare -sqrt{3} and -2, we note that sqrt{3} approx 1.73, so -sqrt{3} > -2 since -1.73 > -2.

We know ( S = 840 ), so: [ a_k = frac{840}{k+2}. ] 3. **Calculate ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1} ) using ( a_k = frac{840}{k+2} ) and Ensure they are in Descending Order:** - For ( k = 1 ): [ a_1 = frac{840}{1+2} = 280. ] - For ( k = 2 ): [ a_2 = frac{840}{2+2} = 210. ] - For ( k = 3 ): [ a_3 = frac{840}{3+2} = 168. ] - For ( k = 4 ): [ a_4 = frac{840}{4+2} = 140. ] - For ( k = 5 ): [ a_5 = frac{840}{5+2} = 120. ] - For ( k = 6 ): [ a_6 = frac{840}{6+2} = 105. ] So far, we calculate ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_6 ) and we sum them: [ 280 + 210 + 168 + 140 + 120 + 105 = 1023. ] 4. **Calculate ( a_7 ) such that Sum of All Numbers is 840:** From the given sum condition: [ 280 + 210 + 168 + 140 + 120 + 105 + a_7 = 840, ] solving for ( a_7 ): [ 1023 + a_7 = 840, ] [ a_7 = 840 - 1023 = -183. ] 5. **Check the Values and Conclusion:** The calculated values are ( a_1 = 280, a_2 = 210, a_3 = 168, a_4 = 140, a_5 = 120, a_6 = 105, a_7 = -183 ), which satisfy the given conditions.

Assume that the distance between any two points is an integer.

Two vertices ( p_1, p_2 ) are connected by an edge if and only if the distance between them is odd. We aim to show that the vertices of ( G ) can be colored using three colors such that the distance between any two points of the same color is even. 2. **Absence of ( K_4 ) in ( G )**: First, we need to show that ( G ) does not contain ( K_4 ) (a complete graph on 4 vertices). This is a known result from the Putnam 1993 problem B5, which states that there do not exist four points in the Euclidean plane such that the pairwise distances between the points are all odd integers. 3. **Volume of a Tetrahedron**: The proof of the above result uses the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron: [ V = frac{1}{12} sqrt{sum_1 a^2b^2c^2 - sum_2 a^2b^2c^2 - sum_3 a^4b^2} ] where: - (sum_1) is taken over the 12 cases where (a, b, c) form an open path of length 3. - (sum_2) is taken over the 4 cases where (a, b, c) form the sides of a face. - (sum_3) is taken over the 6 cases where (a, b) are opposite sides (without a vertex in common). 4. **Modulo 4 Calculations**: If all edges of a planar tetrahedron are odd integers, then the left-hand side (LHS) of the volume formula equals (2 mod 4), which is impossible. This proves that ( G ) does not contain ( K_4 ). 5. **Coloring the Graph**: Suppose there is a triangle in ( G ), say all distances between ( P_1, P_2, P_3 in P ) are odd. We color them by colors 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Consider any other point ( Q in P ) and examine the possible parities of ( QP_1, QP_2, QP_3 ). 6. **Parity Analysis**: - It is established that not all three distances ( QP_1, QP_2, QP_3 ) can be odd. - It is also impossible for all three distances to be even. Assuming that, we get the LHS of the volume formula is odd, which is impossible. - It is also impossible for two of those distances to be even and the remaining one to be odd. In that case, again from the volume formula, we get the LHS is odd, a contradiction. 7. **Coloring Rule**: The only possibility is that two of those distances are odd and the remaining one, say ( QP_i ), is even. Then, we color ( Q ) by the color ( i ). In this way, all points in ( P ) can be colored. It is easy to prove the coloring is appropriate since otherwise, we get four points, all connected, which contradicts the absence of ( K_4 ). 8. **No Triangle in ( G )**: If there is no triangle in ( G ), we claim there is no odd cycle in ( G ). For the sake of contradiction, assume there is one ( P_1, P_2, dots, P_{2n+1} ). It is not possible for ( P_1 ) to be not connected with ( P_4 ). Otherwise, by the volume formula, the LHS would be odd. Hence, ( P_1P_4 ) is an edge. Analogously, ( P_1P_6, P_1P_8, dots, P_1P_{2n} ) are also edges, and finally, we get a triangle ( P_1P_{2n}P_{2n+1} ), but we have assumed there is no triangle in ( G ), a contradiction. 9. **Bipartite Graph**: So, in this case, the graph ( G ) is bipartite and can be colored using 2 colors.

One of these factors would have a constant term of ( pm 1 ), implying it would have a root with absolute value ( leq 1 ). However, since all roots of ( f(x) ) are outside the closed unit disk, this is impossible. Therefore, ( f(x) = x^n + ax + p ) cannot be represented as a product of two integer polynomials.

Start with the original function: [fleft(xright)=frac{1-x}{1+x}] 2. Rewrite the numerator to highlight the transformation: [fleft(xright)=frac{-(x+1)+2}{1+x}=-1+frac{2}{x+1}] This step shows that the function can be seen as a transformation of frac{2}{x+1}, shifted down by 1 unit. Next, we analyze the transformation of fleft(xright) based on the options given: - The center of symmetry of the original function fleft(xright) is at left(-1,-1right) because the function becomes its negative when x is replaced by -x, and it's shifted from the origin by 1 unit in both the x and y directions. - To find an odd function, we need the center of symmetry to be at left(0,0right).

Thus, the function that achieves this transformation is y=fleft(x-1right)+1: [y=fleft(x-1right)+1] This function has its center of symmetry at left(0,0right), making it an odd function because an odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x), and having the center of symmetry at the origin is a characteristic of odd functions.

This can be written as: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + n = 2^m + 3^m ] where ( m ) is some integer. 2. Using the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers, we convert the left-hand side: [ sum_{k=1}^n k = frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 2^m + 3^m. ] 3. To simplify the equation, multiply both sides by 2: [ n(n + 1) = 2^{m+1} + 2 cdot 3^m. ] 4. Next, let's consider this equation modulo 9. First, we analyze the right-hand side modulo 9: - For ( m = 6k ), powers of 2 repeat every 6: [ 2^{6k + 1} equiv 2 pmod{9} ] - For powers of 3, similarly: [ 3^{6k} equiv 1 pmod{9} ] Thus: [ 2^{6k + 1} + 2 cdot 3^{6k} equiv 2 + 2 cdot 1 = 4 pmod{9}. ] 5.

Therefore, it will never match 4 modulo 9, proving a contradiction. 6. Let's confirm our conclusion using another modulus, such as modulo 7.

Consider a circle with center (Q) and radius (r) such that the point (A) lies outside this circle. From the point (A), we can draw two tangents to this circle, and let (P) be one of the tangency points. 2. **Property of the tangency points**: By the geometric properties of tangents, the line segment (AP) is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency, hence, [ AP perp PQ ] This implies that the point (P) sees the segment (AQ) under a right angle. 3. **Angle considerations for the tangency points**: Assume for now that the point (P) does not lie on the line (BC).

Hence, days involving matches between persistent players were also less than (k) due to symmetry in tournament rules (note: persistent players need to play each other too). - Each persistent player plays against (k-1) other persistent players in (k-1) days. - Any matchday without persistent vs. persistent means all persistent players would have to play amongst themselves, which necessitates matches involving only persistent players overflowing (k-1) days—leading to contradiction because it crosses allowable days. 7. **Minimum Number Consideration**: - Given (2k > 4) implies (k > 2) and since (k) is an integer, we have (k geq 4). - This means among the non-persistent set, daily contests requiring persistent player outcomes contradict the persistence requirement having exactly (k-1) matches among themselves. 8. **Conclusion**: - Matches between non-persistent players must occur less, meeting in the strict boundaries aligning to (k), ensuring contradiction thus invalidating fewer meetings premise. Therefore, the number of days with matches between non-persistent players is at least half the days of the tournament.

The recursion relation for ( S(n, k) ) is given by [ S(n, k) = k S(n1, k) + S(n1, k1) quad (k geqslant 2). ]","completion":"Given a set {1, 2, cdots, n} that is partitioned into k nonempty subsets A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{k} such that A_{1} cup A_{2} cup cdots cup A_{k} = {1, 2, cdots, n}, and for any 1 leq i < j leq k, A_i cap A_j = varnothing, we aim to calculate the number of such partitions S(n, k), known as the second kind of Stirling numbers. The recurrence relation for S(n, k) is given by: S(n, k) = k cdot S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1) quad (k geqslant 2). To derive this recurrence relation, we consider two cases: 1. **Case 1: Adding the element n to one of the k subsets formed from {1, 2, cdots, n-1}:** - For any k-partition of {1, 2, cdots, n-1}, we have S(n-1, k) ways. - We can add the element n to each of the k existing subsets. - This provides us k cdot S(n-1, k) ways. 2. **Case 2: Forming a new subset exclusively containing the element n:** - For any (k-1)-partition of {1, 2, cdots, n-1}, we have S(n-1, k-1) ways. - We create a new subset containing only n. - This provides us S(n-1, k-1) ways. Combining both cases, we get: S(n, k) = k cdot S(n-1, k) + S(n-1, k-1).

Now, a smaller cube is inscribed within the cylinder such that one face of the cube is parallel to the cube’s base. This implies that the circle forming the base of the cylinder circumscribes this face of the cube. Therefore, the diagonal of the cube’s face must be equal to the diameter of the cylinder's base, which is 12 inches. This diagonal divides the cube's face, which is a square, into two 45-45-90 triangles. If the side length of the cube is ( s ), then the diagonal (hypotenuse of these triangles) can be expressed in terms of ( s ) as ( ssqrt{2} ).

Given the options and the stipulation that the function is monotonically decreasing, and correcting for the oversight in the solution's approach: The correct viable option, adhering to the condition that m must be less than zero for the function to be decreasing, is m = -1.

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Speed of the first train = 85 km/hr Speed of the second train = 65 km/hr Relative speed = Speed of the first train + Speed of the second train Relative speed = 85 km/hr + 65 km/hr Relative speed = 150 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to match the units of the length of the trains. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) * (1 hr/3600 s) 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 150 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (150 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (750/18) m/s Relative speed = 41.67 m/s (approximately) The distance to be covered for the slower train to pass the driver of the faster one is equal to the length of the slower train, which is 600 meters.

From 4^{b}=5, we can express b as b=log_{4}5. Since log_{4}5 is greater than log_{4}4=1, we have b>1. Next, we compare a and b: - To compare a and b, we consider the ratio frac{b}{a}=frac{log_{4}5}{log_{3}4}. This can be rewritten using the change of base formula as log_{4}5 cdot log_{4}3. - Using the inequality log_{4}5 cdot log_{4}3 < left(frac{log_{4}5 + log_{4}3}{2}right)^2 (by the AM-GM inequality), we find that this is less than left(frac{log_{4}15}{2}right)^2. - Further, since log_{4}15 < log_{4}16 = 2, we have left(frac{log_{4}15}{2}right)^2 < left(frac{2}{2}right)^2 = 1. - Therefore, frac{b}{a} < 1, which implies b < a.

Substituting the minimum value of |AB|, which is b^2, into |BF_2|+|AF_2|=8-|AB|, and given that the maximum value of |BF_2|+|AF_2| is 5, we can solve for the value of b and then determine the eccentricity of the ellipse. **Solution** Given a line l passing through F_1 intersects the ellipse at points A and B, then |BF_2|+|AF_2|+|BF_1|+|AF_1|=2a+2a=4a=8 Therefore, |BF_2|+|AF_2|=8-|AB|.

Observations: - After an even number of jumps, the frog can only be in vertices (A), (C), or (E). This is due to the structure of the hexagon and the restrictions on movement to adjacent vertices. - Denote (a_k), (c_k), and (e_k) as the number of ways for the frog to reach vertices (A), (C), and (E) respectively, after (2k) jumps. - By symmetry, we have (c_k = e_k). 3.

Suppose each is x. - Thus, angle BAD = x and angle BCD = x. 2. **Extended Sides at Point E**: - angle CDE is the external angle for triangle CDE, which equals angle ABC + angle BCD. - Similarly, angle DCE = angle BAD + angle ABD. Because angle ABD = angle CBD (kite properties) and both equal 180^circ - x, angle DCE = x + (180^circ - x) = 180^circ. 3. **Calculating S and S'**: - S = angle CDE + angle DCE = (angle ABC + x) + 180^circ. - We know angle ABC = x (because angle ABD = angle ABC in the kite). So, S = x + x + 180^circ = 2x + 180^circ. - S' = angle BAD + angle ABC = x + x = 2x. 4. **Finding r = S / S'**: - r = frac{2x + 180^circ}{2x} = 1 + frac{180^circ}{2x}. - Since x is the angle between unequal sides, and generally varies, the ratio r depends on x. If x = 90^circ, then r = 1 + frac{180^circ}{180^circ} = 2. # Conclusion: For x = 90^circ, the answer for r is 2. - The correct answer is (B) boxed{r = 2}."},{"prompt":"The sequence 4, a, 9 is a geometric sequence if and only if a=±6 is ( ) A: A sufficient but not necessary condition B: A necessary but not sufficient condition C: A necessary and sufficient condition D: Neither a sufficient nor a necessary conditio","completion":"If the sequence 4, a, 9 is a geometric sequence, then a^2=36, solving this gives: a=±6, Therefore, the condition \\"a=±6\\" is a necessary and sufficient condition for the sequence 4, a, 9 to be a geometric sequence, Thus, the correct choice is: boxed{C}. **Analysis:** By using the definition of a geometric sequence to find the value of a, the answer can be determined."},{"prompt":"Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson recover a suitcase with a threedigit combination lock from a mathematician turned criminal.

Holmes calmly turns the combination lock and opens the suitcase. While Dr. Watson gapes in surprise, Holmes replies, You were indeed right, and the answer was just the value of the word SEA, interpreted as decimal digits. What was the lock combination?","completion":"To solve the cryptic message and find the lock combination, we follow the clues and mathematical logic provided by Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson: 1. **Translate the cryptic message into an addition problem**: The message \\"SEAS + EBB + SEA = BASS\\" suggests an addition problem with each letter representing a distinct digit. The mention of \\"BASE\\" implies the problem is in a different base, let's denote this base as d. 2. **Analyze the units digit**: From the addition problem, we have: begin{array}{@{}c@{;}c@{}c@{}c@{}c@{}c} & & S & E & A & S_d & & & E & B & B_d + & & & S & E & A_d cline{1-6} & & B & A& S& S_d end{array} This implies S + B + A equiv S pmod{d}, leading to the conclusion that B + A must be divisible by d. Since B and A are digits and cannot both be 0, and their sum is less than 2d-2, we deduce that B + A = d. 3. **Consider the ds digit**: With a carry-over of 1 from the units digit, we have 1 + A + B + E equiv S pmod{d}. Given B + A = d, it simplifies to 1 + E equiv S pmod{d}. This means S = E + 1 or E = d - 1 and S = 0. However, S = 0 is not possible since S is a leading digit. Therefore, S = E + 1. 4. **Analyze the d^2 digit**: After another carry-over, 1 + E + E + S equiv A pmod{d}. Since 1 + E + E + S < 3d, the sum minus A can be 0, d, or 2d. The 0 case is discarded because it implies no carry-over, making S and B not distinct. 5. **Solve the system of equations**: Considering the carry-over and the relationships between B, A, S, and E, we establish: begin{align*} B + A &= d E + 1 &= S S + 1 &= B 2E + S +1 - A&= d end{align*} Solving these equations, we find contradictions or deduce that B = S + 2, leading to 3A = 2E + S + 1 - 2B = E - 4. Thus, E = 3A + 4, S = 3A + 5, and B = 3A + 7. 6. **Determine the digits**: Since S, E, and A are decimal digits, S = 3A + 5 le 9 implies A = 0 or 1. Discarding A = 0 because B < d, we find A = 1, leading to B = 10, S = 8, E = 7, in base d = B + A = 11.

Can it happen that the total points scored by all the boys equal the total points scored by all the girls?","completion":"Let us analyze the situation of the chess tournament thoroughly. 1. **Total Number of Players**: There are 12 players in total, consisting of 9 boys and 3 girls. 2. **Total Matches**: Each player plays with every other player exactly once.

Hence, the total number of points distributed among all players is 66. 4. **Points Scored by Boys Among Themselves**: Since there are 9 boys, and each boy plays a match with each other boy once, the total number of matches among boys is: [ binom{9}{2} = frac{9 times 8}{2} = 36 ] Therefore, the total points distributed in matches among boys is 36 points. 5. **Points Scored by Girls Among Themselves**: Similarly, the total number of matches among the 3 girls is: [ binom{3}{2} = frac{3 times 2}{2} = 3 ] Hence, the total points distributed in matches among girls is 3 points. 6. **Points in Matches Between Boys and Girls**: Each boy plays with each girl exactly once, resulting in (since there are 9 boys and 3 girls): [ 9 times 3 = 27 text{ matches} ] Thus, the total points distributed in matches between boys and girls is 27 points. 7. **Summing Up the Distributed Points**: Summarizing the points distributed: [ 36 text{ (points among boys)} + 3 text{ (points among girls)} + 27 text{ (points between boys and girls)} = 66 text{ points} ] 8. **Analyzing If Boys’ Points Can Equal Girls’ Points**: Let's denote the total points scored by all boys as ( P_B ) and by all girls as ( P_G ).

Since every point in those matches also contributes to the total points distribution among girls, we notice: - Points boys could gain in matches against girls. - Points girls could gain in matches against boys. Since the total points for boys and girls must be equal to 66 points, and already 36 points are distributed among boys from their matches, the remaining 30 points must be divided between the matches with girls and boys. - If boys can score a total of x points in matches against girls, it implies girls will score ( 27 - x ) points. Therefore, summing up the boys' total points: [ P_B = 36 + x ] And girls' total points: [ P_G = 3 + (27 - x) = 30 - x + 3 = 30 - x ] Setting ( P_B = P_G ): [ 36 + x = 30 - x ] Solving for ( x ): [ 2x = -6 implies x = -3 ] Which is impossible as points cannot be negative.

Additionally, suppose BT = 5y and ET = y; hence BE = 6y. Using the property of similar triangles (since both are intersected by line overline{DE}, which is transversal to both triangle ADT and triangle BET): - In triangle ATE sim triangle ADT, frac{AE}{AD} = frac{y}{x}. - In triangle BDT sim triangle BET, frac{BD}{BE} = frac{x}{y}. Using these relations: - Since BE = 6y, then BD = 6x. - AE = 3y derived from triangle ATE sim triangle ADT. Note that BC = BD + DC. Since BD = 6x and BE = 6y, we need to find expressions for DC: - DC = BC - BD, and since BC is the whole line segment which is the sum of its parts 6x + DC, so: [ 6x + DC = 6y Rightarrow DC = 6y - 6x. ] Now, solving for CD/DB: [ frac{CD}{DB} = frac{6y - 6x}{6x} = frac{y-x}{x} = frac{y}{x} - 1. ] Since frac{BD}{BE} = frac{x}{y}, we find frac{y}{x} by inverting: frac{y}{x} = frac{6}{5}.

This result is derived from the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and their inscribed angles. 1. **Labeling Points and Angles:** - Let C_{1} be the point where line c intersects circle k_1 other than A. - Let D_{1} be the point where line d intersects circle k_1 other than A. - Let C_{2} be the point where line c intersects circle k_2 other than A. - Let D_{2} be the point where line d intersects circle k_2 other than A. - Let M be the intersection point of lines C_1D_1 and C_2D_2. - Denote angle C_1BA=alpha and angle ABC_2=beta (refer to the figure for clarity). 2. **Identifying Cyclic Quadrilateral:** - Since A and B are intersections of circles k_1 and k_2, we exploit the fact that angles subtended by the same chords are equal. - The quadrilateral AD_2C_2B is cyclic because A and B lie on both circles k_1 and k_2. - Consequently, angle AD_2M = 180^circ - (180^circ - beta) = beta due to the properties of supplementary angles in cyclic quadrilaterals. 3. **Angle at D_1:** - By symmetry and circle properties, the angle at D_1 opposite A subtending chord AD_1 in k_1 is equal to alpha. That is angle D_1AM = alpha. 4. **Calculating Angle Between Lines:** - Now consider triangle D_1MD_2: [ angle D_1MD_2 = 180^circ - (alpha + beta) ] - Since alpha and beta are fixed by the position of points A, B, C_1, C_2 within their respective circles, alpha + beta remains constant. - Thus, angle D_1MD_2 remains constant and does not depend on the choice of lines c and d. # Conclusion: The angle between lines C_1D_1 and C_2D_2 is independent of the specific choices of lines c and d. Instead, it solely depends on the fixed positions of intersection points A and B within the circles k_1 and k_2. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given x > 1, y > 1, and ln x, frac{1}{2}, ln y form a geometric sequence, the minimum value of xy","completion":"**Analysis** This problem mainly examines the properties of the geometric mean and the application of basic inequalities.

If the compound statement p AND q is false and p OR q is true, determine the range of values for the real number a.","completion":"To ensure that the proposition p is true, the function y=log_a(2 - ax) must be decreasing on the interval [0, 1]. - Since the function is decreasing, we deduce that a > 1 because the base of a logarithm must be positive and not equal to 1 for the log function to be decreasing. - Additionally, to satisfy the domain of the log function, 2 - ax > 0 must hold true in the interval [0, 1]. Solving 2 - a > 0 yields a < 2. We can now combine these two constraints to conclude that for proposition p to be true, the range of a must be: 1 < a < 2. For the proposition q to be true, the function y=log(ax^2 - x + frac {a}{12}) must have a range of mathbb{R}. This means that the expression inside the log function, ax^2 - x + frac {a}{12}, must have a range of (0, infty). To determine the conditions for this to occur, we examine two cases: 1. If a=0, then the expression simplifies to -x which cannot have a range of (0, infty) over any interval. Thus, a=0 does not satisfy proposition q. 2. If a neq 0, the discriminant Delta of the quadratic function ax^2 - x + frac {a}{12} must be greater than or equal to 0 for it to have real roots and hence a possibility to span all real values: delta = (-1)^2 - 4 cdot a cdot frac {a}{12} geq 0, which simplifies to 1 - frac {a^2}{3} geq 0. Solving this inequality gives us 0 < a leq sqrt{3}. In summary, for proposition q to be true, the range of a must be: 0 leq a leq sqrt{3}. Given that \\"p AND q\\" is a false statement, but \\"p OR q\\" is true, we know that one of the propositions must be true and the other false. Considering the separate constraints from each proposition, we determine the overall range of a by evaluating when p is true and q is false, and when p is false and q is true. - When p is true, but q is false, it corresponds to: sqrt{3} < a < 2. - When p is false, but q is true, it corresponds to: 0 leq a leq 1.

Must all parallelepipeds have a common point?","completion":": 1. **Setting Up the Coordinate System:** Given that each pair of rectangular parallelepipeds shares at least one common point and their edges are respectively parallel, we can introduce a Cartesian coordinate system. - Choose an arbitrary parallelepiped. - Align the coordinate axes along the three edges meeting at one of its vertices. This vertex becomes the origin (0,0,0). 2. **Examining the Projections on the X-axis:** In this coordinate system, the edges of all parallelepipeds will be parallel to the coordinate axes. - Project the i-th parallelepiped onto the x-axis. This yields a line segment denoted by [a_i, b_i], where i = 1, 2, ldots, n. 3. **Intersection Property:** Each pair of segments [a_i, b_i] and [a_j, b_j] has a non-empty intersection since every pair of parallelepipeds shares a common point. - Consider the maximum value among the left endpoints of these segments: [ A = max{a_i mid i = 1, 2, ldots, n}. ] - Consider the minimum value among the right endpoints of these segments: [ B = min{b_i mid i = 1, 2, ldots, n}. ] Given that every pair of segments intersects, it must hold that A leq B. If it were not the case and A > B, then there would exist segments [a_i, b_i] and [a_j, b_j] such that they do not intersect. 4. **Common Point on the X-axis:** Therefore, any point x^* in the interval [A, B] is a common point of all segments [a_i, b_i].

We are also told that two-thirds of the girls prefer this career, so the number of girls who prefer this career is (2/3)G. The total number of students who prefer this career is therefore xB + (2/3)G. A full circle graph represents 360 degrees, and we are told that 192 degrees of the circle represent the students who prefer this career. The proportion of the circle that represents this career preference is therefore 192/360, which simplifies to 8/15. So, the fraction of the total number of students who prefer this career is equal to the fraction of the circle that represents this career preference: xB + (2/3)G = (8/15)(B + G) Now, we can use the ratio B/G = 2/3 to express B in terms of G: B = (2/3)G Substituting this into the equation, we get: x(2/3)G + (2/3)G = (8/15)( (2/3)G + G) Combining like terms: (2/3)G(x + 1) = (8/15)(5/3)G Simplify the right side: (2/3)G(x + 1) = (8/15)(5/3)G = (8/9)G Now, we can divide both sides by (2/3)G to solve for x: x + 1 = (8/9) / (2/3) x + 1 = (8/9) * (3/2) x + 1 = 4/3 Subtract 1 from both sides to solve for x: x = 4/3 - 3/3 x = 1/3 So, the fraction of the boys who prefer this career is boxed{1/3} ."},{"prompt":"Given that the monotonically decreasing function f(x) defined on (infty, 3] satisfies f(1+sin ^{2}x)leqslant f(a2cos x) for all real numbers x, determine the range of values for a.

What are the angles of the triangle formed by the tangents drawn at the vertices to the circumscribed circle?","completion":"Let's denote the vertices of the triangle as usual with A, B, and C. If the triangle is a right triangle, for instance, gamma = 90^circ, then AB is the diameter of the circumcircle. Therefore, the tangents to the circumcircle at A and B are parallel (as shown in Figure 1). Therefore, in this case, the tangents do not form a triangle. For the further discussion, we assume that the triangle ABC is not a right triangle. Let the vertices of the triangle formed by the tangents to the circumcircle at the vertices A, B, and C be A', B', and C' respectively, and let K be the center of the circumcircle. Based on the relationship between inscribed angles and central angles, the central angle corresponding to the arc BC (not containing A) is 2alpha, the one corresponding to arc CA (not containing B) is 2beta, and the one corresponding to arc AB (not containing C) is 2gamma. Since the tangent to the circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency, we have KA perp B'C', KB perp C'A', and KC perp A'B'.

In this case, the circumcircle of ABC is the excircle of triangle A'B'C' adjacent to side B'C'. Here, the quadrilaterals KAC'B, KBA'C, and KCB'A are cyclic since each has two opposite right angles. The angles we are looking for are the external angles at K in these cyclic quadrilaterals. - In any cyclic quadrilateral, the external angle at a vertex is equal to the internal angle at the opposite vertex.

The remaining provisions will have to be divided among these 4000 men.

Let the sum of the numbers on any face of the cube be denoted by ( S ). 2. We will double each number on the edges and allocate them to the two faces that share the edge. This will help to understand how sums on the individual faces relate to sums across parallel edges. 3. Consider any set of four parallel edges of the cube, and orient the cube so these chosen edges are vertical. 4. Multiply the numbers on the horizontal faces by (-1) and then sum all the (2 cdot 12) numbers on the cube. 5. **Summing by faces:** - For the vertical faces: Each vertical face contains numbers summing to ( S ). - For the horizontal faces: Each horizontal face now contains numbers summing to ( -S ). Therefore, the total sum when summed by faces is: [ 4S - 2S = 2S ] 6. **Summing by edges:** - Consider the values on the horizontal edges: They will effectively cancel out because each number pairs with its (-1) counterpart on the adjacent horizontal edge. - On the vertical edges: Each number appears twice because it belongs to two different vertical faces. Thus, the total sum when summed by edges is: [ 2F ] 7. Equating the two sums obtained through different methods: [ 2S = 2F implies F = S ] This proves that the sum of the numbers on the four parallel edges is equal to ( S ). 8. **Proof of the second statement:** Return to the original numbers written on the edges. Multiply the numbers on the faces meeting at a chosen vertex by (-1). 9. **Summing by faces:** - For the three faces meeting at the chosen vertex: The sum is ( -3S ). - For the three faces meeting at the opposite vertex: The sum is ( 3S ). Thus, the total sum when summed by faces is: [ 3S - 3S = 0 ] 10. **Summing by edges:** - Consider the values on the edges meeting at the chosen vertex: All numbers are multiplied by (-2). - Consider the values on the edges meeting at the opposite vertex: All numbers are multiplied by (2). - For all other edges, the values cancel out because each number pairs with its (-1) counterpart on the adjacent edge. Thus, the total sum when summed by edges represents the difference between the sums at the chosen vertex and its opposite: [ 0 ] This implies the sum of the numbers on the three edges meeting at any vertex is equal to that on the three edges meeting at the opposite vertex. **Conclusion:** [ blacksquare ]"},{"prompt":"Given these six statements: [text{(1) All students are excellent at math}] [text{(2) Some students are excellent at math}] [text{(3) No teachers are excellent at math}] [text{(4) All teachers are poor at math}] [text{(5) At least one teacher is poor at math}] [text{(6) All teachers are excellent at math.}] Which statement negates statement (6)? textbf{(A) }(1)qquad textbf{(B) }(2)qquad textbf{(C) }(3)qquad textbf{(D) }(4)qquad textbf{(E) }(5)","completion":"To find the statement that negates statement (6), \\"All teachers are excellent at math,\\" we assess its logical opposite: [text{Not all teachers are excellent at math.}] This is equivalent to: [text{There exists at least one teacher who is not excellent at math.}] Examining each statement: - **(1) All students are excellent at math.** Focuses on students, not teachers.

From this identity, we solve for sin a: sin^2 a = 1 - cos^2 a = 1 - left(frac{1}{3}right)^2 = 1 - frac{1}{9} = frac{8}{9} Taking the square root and considering that a < frac{pi}{2}, we choose the positive root: sin a = sqrt{frac{8}{9}} = frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} Now, we find sin(2a) using the double angle identity: sin(2a) = 2sin a cos a = 2 times frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} times frac{1}{3} = frac{4sqrt{2}}{9} For the cosine of the vertex angle, we apply the identity involving sine for the angle pi - 2a, recognizing that cos(pi - 2a) = -cos(2a): cos(pi - 2a) = -cos(2a) = -sqrt{1 - sin^2(2a)} = -sqrt{1 - left(frac{4sqrt{2}}{9}right)^2} = -sqrt{1 - left(frac{32}{81}right)} = -sqrt{frac{81}{81} - frac{32}{81}} = -sqrt{frac{49}{81}} = -frac{7}{9} However, since the vertex angle of an isosceles triangle is less than pi and at the top of the triangle, we need the positive cosine value.

Since we know the average person spends 4 days in jail before trial and then half of a 2-week sentence (which is 7 days), we can add these together to find the total days spent in jail per person: 4 days (pre-trial) + 7 days (half of 2-week sentence) = 11 days in jail per person Now, we need to convert the combined weeks of jail time into days to match the units. There are 7 days in a week, so: 9900 weeks * 7 days/week = 69300 days Since we have 69300 total days of jail time and each person spends 11 days in jail, we can find the total number of people arrested by dividing the total days by the days spent in jail per person: 69300 days / 11 days/person = 6300 people arrested Now, we know that there are 10 arrests per day in each city, and the protests last for 30 days. So, in one city, the total number of arrests over 30 days would be: 10 arrests/day * 30 days = 300 arrests per city Finally, to find the number of cities that experienced protests, we divide the total number of people arrested by the number of arrests per city: 6300 people arrested / 300 arrests/city = 21 cities Therefore, boxed{21} cities experienced protests."},{"prompt":"Jackson works 5 days a week going doortodoor collecting for charity.

He needs to visit 88 houses on each of the remaining 3 days (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday).

Since he has to work for 3 more days, the total amount he will collect in the remaining days is: 220/day * 3 days = 660. Now, let's calculate how much he has already collected by Monday and Tuesday: 1000 (goal) - 660 (remaining days) = 340.

In addition to stating the coordinates of the points and distances between points, please include a brief explanation of how you found the configuration of points and computed the distances.","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to find distinct points (A, B, C,) and (D) in the plane such that the length of the segment (AB) is an even integer, and the lengths of the segments (AC, AD, BC, BD,) and (CD) are all odd integers. We will consider different configurations of points and use various theorems to determine if such a configuration is possible. # Case 1: Points Form a Quadrilateral We start by considering the case where the points form a quadrilateral. We can apply Euler's Theorem for Generalized Quadrilaterals, which states: [ overline{AB}^2 + overline{BC}^2 + overline{CD}^2 + overline{DA}^2 = overline{AC}^2 + overline{BD}^2 + 4overline{XY}^2, ] where (X) and (Y) are the midpoints of the diagonals of the quadrilateral. Taking modulo 2 of this equation, we get: [ 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 0 implies 3 = 2 implies 1 = 0. ] This is a contradiction, as (1 neq 0). Therefore, there are no solutions for this case. # Case 2: Points are Collinear Next, we consider the case where (A, B, C,) and (D) are all collinear. Without loss of generality, let (A = (0,0)) on the coordinate plane and let all our collinear points be on the (x)-axis. We are given that (overline{AB}) has to be even, so we can set (B = (2k_1, 0)) or ((-2k_1, 0)) where (k_1 in mathbb{Z}^+). We are also given that segments (overline{AC}, overline{AD}, overline{BC}, overline{BD},) and (overline{CD}) are all lengths of odd integers. Let's start by focusing on (overline{AC}). For this segment to be odd, we can set point (C) as some point ((2k_2 + 1, 0)) or ((-2k_2 + 1, 0)), where (k_2 in mathbb{Z}^+). Additionally, this implies segment (overline{BC}) is some length of (2k_2 + 1), which is also odd. Now, we only need to consider segments (overline{AD}, overline{BD},) and (overline{CD}). Let's focus on (overline{AD}). Once again, we can set point (D) as ((2k_3 + 1, 0)) or ((-2k_3 + 1, 0)), where (k_3 in mathbb{Z}^+). However, note that segment (overline{CD}) is even, since points (C) and (D) respectively are ((2k_2 + 1, 0)) or ((-2k_2 + 1, 0)) and ((2k_3 + 1, 0)) or ((-2k_3 + 1, 0)). However, since both of these points have odd values (and as stated before lie on the (x)-axis), their distance between each other will be even. However, since the problem stated that segment (overline{CD}) was odd, this is a contradiction. There are hence no such solutions for when (A, B, C,) and (D) are collinear. # Case 3: Three Points Collinear and One Point Not We will consider what happens when three points of the four are collinear and when the last point is somewhere else, forming a triangle in the end. For this case, we can use Stewart's theorem to see if there is a possible configuration. Without loss of generality, let (B = (0, 0)). Here, we have three subcases to consider: Subcase 1: (overline{AB}) is the Cevian Let the collinear points (C, B, D) lie in that respective order. By Stewart's Theorem, we have: [ overline{AC}^2 cdot overline{DB} + overline{AD}^2 cdot overline{CB} = overline{DC}left(overline{AB}^2 + overline{BC} cdot overline{DB}right). ] Taking modulo 2 on this equation, we get: [ 1 cdot 1 + 1 cdot 1 = 1(0 + 1 cdot 1) implies 2 = 1. ] Once again, we arrive at a contradiction, since (2 neq 1). For this subcase, there are no possible quadruplets of (A, B, C,) and (D) which satisfy the problem's conditions. Subcase 2: (overline{AB}) is a Side Length Let the collinear points of our triangle be (B, C, D) in respective order ((overline{AC}) will be the cevian). Once again, using Stewart's theorem gets us: [ overline{AB}^2 cdot overline{CD} + overline{AD}^2 cdot overline{BC} = overline{BD}left(overline{AC}^2 + overline{CD} cdot overline{BC}right). ] Taking modulo 2, we get: [ 0 cdot 1 + 1 cdot 1 = 1(1 + 1 cdot 1) implies 1 = 2. ] This again is a contradiction, since (1 neq 2). Once again, we conclude there are no possible quadruplets of (A, B, C,) and (D) which satisfy the problem's condition. Subcase 3: (overline{AB}) is a Segment of the Side Split by the Cevian Without loss of generality, let the non-collinear point be (D), and the three collinear points be in the order of (A, B, C). Using Stewart's Theorem, we have: [ overline{AD}^2 cdot overline{BC} + overline{DC}^2 cdot overline{AB} = overline{AC}left(overline{DB}^2 + overline{BC} cdot overline{AB}right). ] Taking modulo 2, we get: [ 1 cdot 1 + 1 cdot 0 = 1(1 + 1 cdot 0) implies 1 = 1. ] Finally, we arrive at a working case. Subcase 4: (overline{AB}) is the Side Split by the Cevian Let the non-collinear point be (D), and let the collinear points be in the order of (A, C, B), respectively. Using Stewart's Theorem we find: [ overline{AD}^2 cdot overline{CB} + overline{DB}^2 cdot overline{AC} = overline{AB}left(overline{DC}^2 + overline{CB} cdot overline{AC} right). ] Taking modulo 2 of this, we get: [ 1 cdot 1 + 1 cdot 1 = 0(1 + 1 cdot 1) implies 2 = 0 implies 0 = 0. ] Thus, this is our second possible way of a configuration. # Finding a Working Quadruplet Now that we have found when a solution quadruplet exists (subcase when (overline{AB}) is a segment of the side which was split by the cevian and subcase when (overline{AB}) is the side that is split by the cevian), it suffices to find one working quadruplet. Thus, we only need to consider one working case, which is as follows. Working Case: (overline{AB}) is a Segment of the Side Split by the Cevian Our non-collinear point will be (D), and the three collinear points will be in the order of (A, B, C). For simplicity, let (overline{AB} = 2n + 2), (overline{BC} = 2m + 1), (overline{AD} = 2b + 1), (overline{CD} = 2c + 1), and (overline{BD} = 2d + 1). We can write the following Python program to generate working quintuplets of side lengths: \`\`\`python def ti(x, y, z): return x + y > z and x + z > y and y + z > x for n in range(20): for m in range(20): for b in range(20): for c in range(20): for d in range(20): if (((2 * b + 1) * (2 * b + 1) * (2 * m + 1) + (2 * c + 1) * (2 * c + 1) * (2 * n + 2) == (2 * n + 2 * m + 3) * ((2 * n + 2) * (2 * m + 1) + (2 * d + 1) * (2 * d + 1))) and ti(b, n, d) and ti(d, m, c) and ti(b, c, n + m)): print(str(2 * n + 2) + \\" \\" + str(2 * m + 1) + \\" \\" + str(2 * b + 1) + \\" \\" + str(2 * c + 1) + \\" \\" + str(2 * d + 1)) \`\`\` The range that (n, m, b, c,) and (d) are in can be altered. Below are the outputs of the first few working quintuplets: \`\`\` 8 3 13 9 9 8 3 23 21 21 8 5 11 11 9 8 5 15 11 11 8 5 27 25 25 8 7 9 9 5 8 7 15 15 13 8 7 17 13 13 8 7 17 23 19 \`\`\` It suffices to find one working quadruplet of coordinates (A, B, C,) and (D), so we can just pick any of these side lengths and then find the coordinates that form those side lengths. Consider our working quintuplet of side lengths ((overline{AB}, overline{BC}, overline{AD}, overline{CD}, overline{BD}) = (8, 7, 9, 9, 5)). Without loss of generality, let (A = (0, 0)). It follows that (B = (8, 0)) and (C = (15, 0)). Let (D = (a, b)). By the distance formula, we find: [ sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 9, quad sqrt{(a - 15)^2 + b^2} = 9. ] Solving these equations, we get (D = (a, b) = left(frac{15}{2}, frac{3sqrt{51}}{2}right)). Thus, we have found a working quadruplet of points: [ boxed{left(A = (0, 0), B = (8, 0), C = (15, 0), D = left(frac{15}{2}, frac{3sqrt{51}}{2}right)right)}. ]"},{"prompt":"f x y > x and 3x + 2y < 2y, determine the relationship between x and y.

This does not definitively establish that line m is parallel to plane alpha without considering the possibility of m being in alpha. Therefore, option A is not necessarily correct. **Option B**: If line m is perpendicular to plane alpha and line m is also perpendicular to line n, it implies that line n could either be contained in plane alpha or be parallel to plane alpha. This does not guarantee that line n is parallel to plane alpha as it could also be contained within alpha. Hence, option B is not necessarily correct. **Option C**: Given that plane alpha is perpendicular to plane beta, line m is contained in plane alpha, plane alpha intersects plane beta at line n, and line m is perpendicular to line n, it follows from the properties of perpendicular planes that line m is perpendicular to plane beta. This is because a line perpendicular to the line of intersection of two planes and lying in one of the planes is perpendicular to the other plane. Therefore, option C is correct. **Option D**: If line m is perpendicular to plane alpha, line m is parallel to line n, and line n is contained in plane beta, there is no direct theorem that states plane alpha is perpendicular to plane beta based solely on these conditions. The conclusion about the perpendicularity of planes alpha and beta cannot be drawn without additional information about their orientation or the relationship between line m and plane beta.

Therefore, their intersection, denoted as ( O ), is the circumcenter of ( triangle ABC ). 3. **Angles at the Circumcenter:** - At the circumcenter ( O ): [ angle BOC = 2angle A ] [ angle CBO = angle BOC = 90^circ - angle A ] 4. **Cylic Quadrilateral ( B C_1 C O ):** - By construction: [ angle OC_1B = 90^circ - angle A = angle OCB ] - Hence, quadrilateral ( B C_1 C O ) is cyclic. 5. **Cyclic Quadrilateral ( B C B_1 O ):** By construction, angle at the circumcenter ( O ): [ angle OB_1C = 180^circ - angle AB_1O = 90^circ + angle A = 180^circ - angle CBO ] - This implies quadrilateral ( B C B_1 O ) is cyclic. 6. **Combining Cyclic Quadrilaterals:** - Therefore, ( BC_1CB_1 ) is cyclic as it's the intersection of two cyclic quadrilaterals ( BC_1CO ) and ( BCBO ). 7. **Relation among Points ( B_1, C_1, B_2, C_2 ):** - Using the property of angles in cyclic quadrilaterals: [ angle B_1 C_1 B_2 = angle B_1 C_1 B - angle B_2 C_1 B ] [ angle B_1 C_2 B_2 = angle B_1 CB - angle CB_1 C_2 ] 8. **Angles Equalities:** - Since ( B C_1 C B_1 ) is cyclic: [ angle B_1 C_1 B = angle B_1 C B ] - And, [ angle B_2 C_1 B = angle OC_1 B = 90^circ - angle A = 180^circ - angle OB_1 C = angle C B_1 C_2 ] 9. **Conclude Cyclicity:** - Therefore: [ angle B_1 C_1 B_2 = angle B_1 C_2 B_2 ] - This confirms that quadrilateral ( B_1 B_2 C_1 C_2 ) is cyclic. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The points } B_1, C_1, B_2, text{and } C_2 text{ are concyclic.}}"},{"prompt":"Let n in mathbb{N}^{*}. We are given 2n points on the edge of a circle. Let F_{n} denote the number of ways to connect these points in pairs using n chords such that no two chords intersect inside the circle. Find a recurrence relation for F_{n}.","completion":"1. Given ( n in mathbb{N}^* ), we have ( 2n ) points on the edge of a circle. 2. We define ( F_n ) as the number of ways to connect these ( 2n ) points into ( n ) non-intersecting chords. 3. To establish a recurrence relation for ( F_n ), let's choose an arbitrary point, for example, the topmost point on the circle, and consider the connections that involve this point. 4. Note that the chord involving this point will connect to another point on the circumference, splitting the circle into two regions that must also independently satisfy the non-intersecting chord condition. 5. Let ( k ) represent the number of points strictly on one side of this chosen chord, which therefore has ( 2k ) points on one side and ( 2(n-k-1) ) points on the other side. 6. The chosen chord therefore partitions the problem into two smaller subproblems: - One subproblem involves ( 2k ) points, for which there are ( F_k ) ways to connect them. - The other subproblem involves ( 2(n-k-1) ) points, for which there are ( F_{n-k-1} ) ways to connect them. 7. Summing up the number of ways for each possible ( k ) where ( k ) ranges from 0 to ( n-1 ), we get the following recurrence relation: [ F_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} F_k F_{n-k-1} ] This recurrence relation encapsulates all possible ways to pair the ( 2n ) points without intersection, by considering each potential split of the points by the chosen chord. # Conclusion: [ boxed{F_n = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} F_k F_{n-k-1}} ]"}]`),F={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function N(o,e,h,m,n,r){const u=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>n.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),i(y,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,p)=>(a(),v(u,{key:p,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(n.searchQuery)+'".
