Speed in m/s = (Speed in km/hr) × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) For the train: Speed of train in m/s = 45 km/hr × (1000 m / 1 km) × (1 hr / 3600 s) Speed of train in m/s = 45 × 1000 / 3600 Speed of train in m/s = 45000 / 3600 Speed of train in m/s = 12.5 m/s Now, we need to consider the effect of the wind.

Among the remaining defective units, 3 percent of the units with Type A defects and 6 percent of the units with Type B defects are shipped for sale. What percent of the units produced are defective units with either Type A or Type B defects that are shipped for sale after accounting for reworked and repaired units?","completion":"Let's assume that we start with 100 units for simplicity. In the first stage, 7% of the units are defective with Type A defects. So, we have: 7% of 100 units = 7 units with Type A defects. In the second stage, an additional 8% of the units have Type B defects. So, we have: 8% of 100 units = 8 units with Type B defects. Now, let's calculate the number of units that are reworked and repaired: For Type A defects, 40% are reworked: 40% of 7 units = 0.40 * 7 = 2.8 units reworked. For Type B defects, 30% are reworked: 30% of 8 units = 0.30 * 8 = 2.4 units reworked.

For Type B defects: 8 units - 2.4 units reworked = 5.6 units with Type B defects remaining. Next, we calculate the percentage of these remaining defective units that are shipped for sale: For Type A defects, 3% are shipped: 3% of 4.2 units = 0.03 * 4.2 = 0.126 units shipped. For Type B defects, 6% are shipped: 6% of 5.6 units = 0.06 * 5.6 = 0.336 units shipped. Finally, we add the shipped defective units of both types to find the total percent of defective units shipped for sale: 0.126 units (Type A) + 0.336 units (Type B) = 0.462 units.

The basis for our proof will be using this concept. 3. **Representing the Problem with a Rectangle:** Let's consider a rectangle of dimensions (kx) by (ky) such that it can be subdivided into (pq) equal non-rectangular pieces. We need to prove this assumption is valid. 4. **Multiples and Scaling:** We assume there exists a rectangle that can be divided into (pq) congruent non-rectangular shapes. By doubling the side lengths of this rectangle, we can create a larger square (since doubling a rectangle's dimensions will result in a square if (kx=ky)). 5. **Construction and Visualization:** Imagine you have a rectangle of dimensions (a times b), where (a) and (b) can be prime factors such as (p) and (q). By extending both dimensions to form a larger square, we retain the divisibility properties. 6. **Detailed Visualization Using Primes (p) and (q):** Suppose we consider a small rectangle that can fit exactly (pq) smaller units where each unit can be treated as a non-rectangular shape. Let’s consider smaller shapes arranged in a grid that is (p) rows by (q) columns. 7. **Extension to a Square:** This construction must hold when extended to a larger size (specifically, a square). By ensuring the subdivision is proportional and maintaining the non-rectangular property, we can multiply its sides accordingly to get a larger square. 8. **Proof by Composition:** We can form a composition by arranging the smaller shapes such that they maintain the (pq) subdivision. 9. **Conclusion:** Therefore, this proves that any square can be divided into (pq) equal non-rectangular shapes where (p) and (q) are distinct prime numbers. By ensuring proportionality and maintaining the subdivision properties, the integrity of the (pq) equal subdividing congruent non-rectangular shapes carries over from a smaller rectangle to a square. Conclusion Hence, it is possible to divide a square into (pq) equal non-rectangular shapes with (p) and (q) being distinct prime numbers. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Vivian plays some Spotify songs every day.

Since d > r, the tangents do not touch the circle. 2. **Finding Equidistant Points**: - Points equidistant from two parallel lines lie on the midline between them. The midline in this case is still the horizontal line through O. - However, because d > r, a point equidistant from the circle would be outside the circle and on a circle with a larger radius centered at O (radius = d). Since both tangents and the circle's extended radius are symmetric about O, we look at the geometry on this line. 3. **Identifying Specific Points**: - The only point on the midline that is equidistant from the circle (any point on the circle's perimeter) and the tangents is the center O itself. - The tangents are too far to have any other common equidistant points with the circle on the midline, as d > r means no horizontal diameter or extensions intersect tangents. 4. **Conclusion**: - The only point equidistant from the given circle and the two parallel tangents, under the condition d > r, is the center of the circle, O.

If (m) has the prime factorization (m = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k}), then: [ tau(m) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1) ] 2. **Assumption and Simplification**: Suppose (n neq k). We need to find (s) such that (tau(sn) = tau(sk)). If (m mid n) or (n mid m), then there is no such (s) because the number of divisors would inherently differ due to the multiplicative properties of the divisor function.

This division can be visualized by drawing vertical lines dividing the rectangle into 2 equal parts of width 2 units and horizontal lines dividing each part into 3 equal parts of height 1 unit. 2. **Pigeonhole Principle**: - By the pigeonhole principle, if 6 points are placed inside the 4 times 3 rectangle, at least one of the six 2 times 1 rectangles must contain at least 2 of these points. - This principle states that if n items are put into m containers, where n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. 3. **Distance Within a 2 times 1 Rectangle**: - Consider one of these 2 times 1 rectangles. The goal is to find the maximum possible distance between any two points within this 2 times 1 rectangle. - The longest distance between two points in a 2 times 1 rectangle is the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. 4. **Calculate the Diagonal**: - To find the length of the diagonal, use the Pythagorean theorem. - The diagonal length ( d ) of a rectangle with width 2 and height 1 is given by: [ d = sqrt{(2)^2 + (1)^2} = sqrt{4 + 1} = sqrt{5} ] 5. **Conclusion**: - Since the maximum distance between any two points in a 2 times 1 rectangle is sqrt{5}, placing 6 points in a 4 times 3 rectangle ensures that at least one 2 times 1 rectangle contains 2 points, and thus, there are always at least two points whose distance is less than or equal to sqrt{5}.

Since the circle is tangent at these points, OE perp DE and OF perp DF. The radius of this circle is 3sqrt{3}, so OE = OF = 3sqrt{3}. 2. **Congruence of Triangles**: Since DE = DF and OE = OF, triangle DEO is congruent to triangle DFO by Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence. Thus, angle DEO = angle DFO. 3. **Determine the Angle at Vertex D**: Let theta = angle DEO. Then, angle DFE = 2theta as the isosceles triangle splits the vertex angle into two equal parts. 4. **Calculate the Length of EF**: Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle EOF: [ EF = 2 times OE = 2 times 3sqrt{3} = 6sqrt{3} ] 5. **Law of Sines for Circumradius R**: [ 2R = frac{EF}{sin angle DFE} = frac{6sqrt{3}}{sin (2theta)} ] Using the double angle identity for sine: [ sin (2theta) = 2 sin(theta) cos(theta) ] Since OE = 3sqrt{3}, using the right triangle OED, sin(theta) = frac{OE}{DE} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{4sqrt{6}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, hence cos(theta) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (as it's a 45^circ angle). Therefore: [ sin (2theta) = 2 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = frac{1}{2} ] Substitute back: [ 2R = frac{6sqrt{3}}{frac{1}{2}} = 12sqrt{3} ] So, R = 6sqrt{3}. 6. **Area of the Circumcircle**: [ pi R^2 = pi (6sqrt{3})^2 = 108pi ] So, the area of the circle is 108pi.

The statement is trivially true since the grasshopper can already be anywhere in the square. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume the statement holds for some n geq 0. That is, the grasshopper can land in any cell when the square is divided into 4^n cells. - Now consider the square when it is divided into 2^{n+1} parts per side, creating 4^{n+1} cells. Each of these larger cells from dividing the square are themselves squares where the side length is half of the previous side length. Thus, they are 2^n times 2^n smaller squares within the larger cell. 3. **Homothety Transformation:** - Select any one of these 4^n cells from the (n+1)th division, and pick the nearest vertex of the original square to this cell. - Perform a homothety (scaling transformation) with the chosen vertex as the center and a scaling factor of 2. - This homothety transformation maps the selected smaller cell onto one of the cells from the nth division of the square. By the induction hypothesis, the grasshopper can reach any cell of 4^n cells. 4. **Grasshopper’s Movement:** - If the grasshopper can land in any of 4^n cells by the induction hypothesis, then starting from any cell in the (n+1)th division, the grasshopper can jump half the distance to the targeted vertex, landing it exactly where needed and reaching the required cell in the new (n+1) division. Conclusion: By mathematical induction, the grasshopper can land in any cell of the square, no matter how fine the division due to any n. This implies that the grasshopper can eventually reach the hole.

This implies the number of sides of any other facet is strictly less than ( m ). 3. **Contradiction in Count**: However, since ( mathcal{G} ) has ( m ) sides, it would be adjacent through its sides to ( m ) other facets.

Thus, the complex number z + 2i becomes x + (y + 2)i. Given that z + 2i is a real number, it implies that the imaginary part must be zero. Therefore, we can equate the imaginary part to zero to find y: y + 2 = 0 implies y = -2. Next, we consider the condition that frac{z}{{2-i}} is real. Substituting z = x + yi into this expression gives us: frac{x - 2i}{2-i} = frac{(x-2i)(2+i)}{(2-i)(2+i)} = frac{2x+2}{5} + frac{x-4}{5}i. For this expression to be real, the coefficient of i, i.e., the imaginary part, must be zero. Setting the imaginary part to zero gives us the equation for x: frac{x-4}{5} = 0 implies x = 4. Therefore, with x = 4 and y = -2, we find z = 4 - 2i, and its conjugate overline{z} = 4 + 2i.

Let ( A_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, 3, ldots, 2017 ) be the given points. 2. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle**: Since there are 2017 points, there are ( binom{2017}{2} = frac{2017 times 2016}{2} = 2033136 ) possible line segments formed by these points. If there are at least 2017 good triangles, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least one line segment ( A_iA_j ) that is used in at least 3 good triangles. 3. **Identify the good triangles**: Let ( A_k, A_l, A_m ) be points such that the triangles ( triangle A_iA_jA_k ), ( triangle A_iA_jA_l ), and ( triangle A_iA_jA_m ) are good triangles.

This implies that ( A_k, A_l, A_m ) are collinear. 6. **Contradiction**: This contradicts the given condition that no three points are collinear.

Since 45% + 35% = 80%, the remaining 20% are in Calculus. So, 20% of 240 students = 0.20 * 240 = 48 students Now, let's find out how many students are enrolled in both Statistics and Calculus, and Geometry and Calculus: - Statistics and Calculus: 10% of the students in Statistics = 0.10 * 108 = 10.8, which we'll round to 11 students (since we can't have a fraction of a student). - Geometry and Calculus: 5% of the students in Geometry = 0.05 * 84 = 4.2, which we'll round to 4 students.

We are given that A = 48 and the least common multiple (LCM) of A and B is 432. The LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). In formula terms: LCM(A, B) = (A * B) / GCD(A, B) We are given that LCM(A, B) = 432 and A = 48. We need to find B and the ratio A:B. First, let's find the GCD of A and B. Since we don't know B yet, we can't directly calculate the GCD. However, we can use the fact that the GCD of A and B must be a divisor of A since the GCD of two numbers divides both numbers. The divisors of 48 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48. Now, let's use the LCM formula to express B in terms of the GCD: 432 = (48 * B) / GCD(48, B) Multiplying both sides by GCD(48, B) gives us: 432 * GCD(48, B) = 48 * B Now, let's divide both sides by 48: 9 * GCD(48, B) = B This means that B is a multiple of 9 and the GCD of 48 and B. Since B is a multiple of 9, let's consider the possible values of GCD(48, B) from the divisors of 48 that are also multiples of 9. The only divisors of 48 that are multiples of 9 are 3 and 24. If GCD(48, B) = 3, then B would be 9 * 3 = 27. However, the LCM of 48 and 27 is not 432, so this is not the correct GCD. If GCD(48, B) = 24, then B would be 9 * 24 = 216. The LCM of 48 and 216 is indeed 432, so this is the correct GCD. Therefore, B = 216 and the ratio A:B is 48:216.

This factorization reveals several key features of the graph: 1. **Holes**: A hole occurs in the graph where a factor is canceled out in both the numerator and the denominator. Here, the factor (x+2) cancels out, indicating a hole at x=-2. Thus, we have a=1 hole. 2. **Vertical Asymptotes**: Vertical asymptotes occur at the zeros of the denominator that are not canceled out by the numerator. In this case, the zeros of the denominator are x=0 and x=1, neither of which are canceled by the numerator. Therefore, we have b=2 vertical asymptotes. 3. **Horizontal Asymptotes**: After canceling the common factor, the simplified function is frac{x+1}{x^2-x}. As x approaches infinity, the highest degree term in the denominator (x^2) dominates, making the function approach 0. This means there is a horizontal asymptote at y=0, so c=1. 4. **Oblique Asymptotes**: Oblique (or slant) asymptotes occur when the degree of the numerator is exactly one higher than the degree of the denominator. After canceling the common factors, the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, meaning there cannot be any oblique asymptotes. Thus, d=0.

The length of any side of the intersection (which belongs to a fixed face of the tetrahedron) is a linear function along this segment. 4. **Summing Linear Functions:** The perimeter of the intersection is the sum of the lengths of these sides, which are linear functions along ( PQ ). Therefore, the value of the perimeter at any point on ( PQ ) lies between its values at the endpoints ( P ) and ( Q ). 5. **Bounding the Perimeter:** - **Case for Minimum Value (2a):** If the intersection is exactly along the edges of the tetrahedron, forming a flat straight line along an edge, the minimum dimension corresponding to two tetrahedral edges will be: [ 2a ] - **General Quadrilateral Case (up to 3a):** Each side of the tetrahedron is no longer than ( a ).

For example, the pair (17, 71) produces the differences (1-7 = -6) and (7-1 = 6).

So, XC = 150 cos(theta) = 150 sqrt{frac{133}{260}}. Simplifying further, BY = 150 - XC. Since XY = 150 - BY - XC, we calculate XY = frac{300 sqrt{133} - 300}{260}. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle QPM with sides r + 20, 20 - r, and XY, we solve to find r = m - nsqrt{k}. After solving and simplifying, it yields r = 58 - 8sqrt{41}.

This means: - If a red and a blue chameleon meet, both turn green. - If a red and a green chameleon meet, both turn blue. - If a blue and a green chameleon meet, both turn red.

If that were possible: - Suppose all became red. Then ( r = 300 ), and ( b = v = 0 ). - This would mean: [ r - b = 300 - 0 = 300 equiv 0 mod 3 ] which contradicts the invariant ( r - b equiv 1 mod 3 ). - Similarly, converting all to blue or green will also contradict the other invariants. 6. **Conclusion:** Given the established modular arithmetic invariants, the state where all chameleons can turn into a single color is impossible.

This means that a list ( L ) is considered smaller than another list ( M ) if ( L ) is shorter than ( M ) or, if they are of equal length, the first position where they differ has a smaller element in ( L ) than in ( M ). 3. **Bird Movement Mechanics**: - Each time the chagrins scare a bird, the bird moves from one tree to another tree that has at least as many birds as the tree it left. - In terms of lists, this translates to decreasing one element ( a_i ) (which represents the tree from which the bird departs) by 1 and increasing another element ( a_j ) (representing the new tree) by 1 where ( a_i leq a_j ). 4. **Effect on Lexicographic Order**: - When the bird moves, the list configuration is altered as: [ {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{120}} rightarrow {a_1, ldots, a_i - 1, ldots, a_j + 1, ldots, a_{120}} ] - After the movement, if we re-sort the list in non-decreasing order, the altered configuration will be strictly smaller in lexicographic order than the prior configuration. 5. **Finiteness of Possible Configurations**: - Given that the total number of birds remains constant at 2021, there are only a finite number of lists with 120 elements each representing non-negative integers summing to 2021. - The total number of such unique lists (partitions of 2021 into 120 parts) is finite. 6. **Convergence to Single Tree**: - Since with each move the configuration strictly decreases in lexicographic order and the number of possible configurations is finite, we must eventually reach a minimal configuration. - The minimal configuration, given the constraints and the rules of movement, can only be one where all birds have congregated onto a single tree. Any other configuration would have a lexicographically smaller successor until only a singular peak remains. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{After a finite number of moves, all the birds will be on the same tree.}} ]"},{"prompt":"w many ways are there to put 7 balls into 3 boxes if the balls are not distinguishable and neither are the boxes?","completion":"To find the number of ways to distribute 7 indistinguishable balls into 3 indistinguishable boxes, we need to consider all the different combinations of ball distributions that result in sums that equal 7: - ( (7,0,0) ): All balls are in one box. - ( (6,1,0) ): Almost all balls in one box, one in another. - ( (5,2,0) ): Majority in one box, two in another. - ( (5,1,1) ): Majority in one box, one ball in each of the other two. - ( (4,3,0) ): Majority in one, the rest in another. - ( (4,2,1) ): Majority in one, two in another, and one in the last. - ( (3,3,1) ): Evenly split into two boxes and one in the remaining box. - ( (3,2,2) ): Two boxes with two balls each, and three balls in the last one.

Since: [ overrightarrow{QQ'} = frac{overrightarrow{EE'}}{2} quad text{and} quad overrightarrow{RR'} = frac{overrightarrow{FF'}}{2} ] the vector overrightarrow{QQ'} transforms into overrightarrow{RR'} under the 60^circ rotation. 4. **Show Using Vector Relations**: By our assumption, the triangle PQR is equilateral, meaning: [ overrightarrow{PQ} quad text{transforms into} quad overrightarrow{PR} quad text{under a} quad 60^circ quad text{rotation}. ] Therefore: [ overrightarrow{P Q'} = overrightarrow{PQ} + overrightarrow{QQ'} quad text{transforms into} quad overrightarrow{PR'} = overrightarrow{PR} + overrightarrow{RR'} quad text{under a} quad 60^circ quad text{rotation}. ] This implies that triangle PQ'R' is equilateral. 5. **Conclusion**: We have confirmed that if PQR is equilateral, the midpoints of the sides of different configurations of the hexagon (obtained through rotations) will also form an equilateral triangle. Thus, by this method, we have shown that the midpoints of sides BC, DE, and FA of the hexagon ABCDEF naturally form a regular triangle.

We will work through this in detailed steps: 1. **Determine the total number of outcomes for 10 coin tosses:** Each coin toss has two possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T). Therefore, the total number of sequences of 10 coin tosses is given by: [ 2^{10} = 1024 ] 2. **Calculate the number of valid sequences without two consecutive heads using combinatorics:** Let's consider all possible combinations where we are specifying the placement of heads such that no two heads are adjacent. We can break this down by counting the valid sequences for different numbers of heads. - **No heads at all:** There is exactly 1 combination of 10 tails: [ text{TTTTTTTTTT} ] - **One head:** The head can be placed in any one of the 10 positions, and the remaining are tails (T): [ 10 text{ ways} ] - **Two heads:** We need to place the heads such that they are not adjacent. If there are 2 heads, there must be at least one tail between them. Thus, for the placement of 2 heads, we choose 2 positions out of 9 (since we are separating them with at least one tail): [ binom{9}{2} = 36 text{ ways} ] - **Three heads:** Similarly, to place 3 heads such that no two heads are adjacent, we are effectively placing 3 heads in non-adjacent positions over 8 spaces: [ binom{8}{3} = 56 text{ ways} ] - **Four heads:** To place 4 heads such that no two heads are adjacent, we choose 4 positions out of 7: [ binom{7}{4} = 35 text{ ways} ] - **Five heads:** To place 5 heads such that no two heads are adjacent, we choose 5 positions out of 6: [ binom{6}{5} = 6 text{ ways} ] Therefore, summing all these up, we get: [ 1 + 10 + 36 + 56 + 35 + 6 = 144 ] 3. **Validate using a recursive approach:** Let ( f(n) ) be the number of valid sequences of ( n ) coin tosses without two consecutive heads. The sequences can end in either heads (if the previous symbol was a tail) or tails. Using this logic, we get the recursive relation: [ f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) ] with the initial conditions: [ f(1) = 2, quad f(2) = 3 ] We can calculate ( f ) for ( n=3 ) to ( n=10 ): [ begin{aligned} f(3) & = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5 f(4) & = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8 f(5) & = f(4) + f(3) = 8 + 5 = 13 f(6) & = f(5) + f(4) = 13 + 8 = 21 f(7) & = f(6) + f(5) = 21 + 13 = 34 f(8) & = f(7) + f(6) = 34 + 21 = 55 f(9) & = f(8) + f(7) = 55 + 34 = 89 f(10) & = f(9) + f(8) = 89 + 55 = 144 end{aligned} ] Thus, ( f(10) = 144 ). 4. **Calculate the probability:** The probability that no two heads are consecutive in 10 coin tosses is: [ frac{f(10)}{2^{10}} = frac{144}{1024} = frac{9}{64} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{9}{64}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given the universe U={1, 2, 3, 4} and M={2, 3}, find the complement of M with respect to U, denoted by complement_U M.","completion":"Since the universe is U={-1, -2, -3, -4} and the set M={-2, -3}, the complement of M with respect to U is the set of elements in U that are not in M.

We need to prove that the line ( AK ) passes through the circumcenter of triangle ( AMN ). 2. **Step 1**: Consider the circumcircles of ( triangle AMC ) and ( triangle ANB ). These circles intersect at points ( A ) and ( K ). By the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we know that: [ angle AKC = angle AMC quad text{and} quad angle AKB = angle ANB ] 3. **Step 2**: Since ( angle MAN = 30^circ ), we can use the fact that ( angle AMC ) and ( angle ANB ) are angles subtended by the same arc in their respective circumcircles. Therefore: [ angle AMC = 180^circ - angle MAN = 180^circ - 30^circ = 150^circ ] Similarly, [ angle ANB = 180^circ - angle MAN = 180^circ - 30^circ = 150^circ ] 4. **Step 3**: Since ( angle AKC = angle AMC ) and ( angle AKB = angle ANB ), we have: [ angle AKC = 150^circ quad text{and} quad angle AKB = 150^circ ] 5. **Step 4**: Now, consider the triangle ( triangle BKC ). Since ( angle BKC = angle AKC + angle AKB ), we get: [ angle BKC = 150^circ + 150^circ = 300^circ ] This is not possible since the sum of angles in a triangle cannot exceed ( 180^circ ). Therefore, we need to reconsider the angles. 6. **Step 5**: Instead, we should consider the fact that ( angle BKC ) is an external angle to ( triangle AKC ) and ( triangle AKB ). Therefore: [ angle BKC = 360^circ - (angle AKC + angle AKB) = 360^circ - (150^circ + 150^circ) = 60^circ ] 7. **Step 6**: Since ( angle BKC = 60^circ ), and ( triangle ABC ) is a regular triangle with each angle ( 60^circ ), we can deduce that ( A ) is the circumcenter of ( triangle BKC ). 8. **Step 7**: Since ( A ) is the circumcenter of ( triangle BKC ), the line ( AK ) is the perpendicular bisector of ( BC ). This implies that ( AK ) is also the perpendicular bisector of ( MN ) because ( M ) and ( N ) lie on ( BC ). 9. **Step 8**: Therefore, ( AK ) passes through the circumcenter of ( triangle AMN ) because the circumcenter of a triangle is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides intersect.

The natural numbers from 1 to 22 greater than 11 are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. 4. **Evaluate for Larger Prime Numbers**: Identify which numbers will form an integer when paired appropriately: - Prime numbers greater than 11: 13, 17, 19 can only form integer values by using the numerator as 1. 5. **Form the Fractions**: - frac{19}{1} = 19 (integer) - frac{17}{1} = 17 (integer) - frac{13}{1} = 13 (integer) 6. **Evaluate Divisors for Other Numbers**: - frac{22}{11}=2 (integer) - frac{21}{3}=7 (integer) - frac{20}{10}=2 (integer) - frac{18}{9}=2 (integer) - frac{16}{8}=2 (integer) - frac{15}{5}=3 (integer) - frac{14}{7}=2 (integer) - frac{12}{6}=2 (integer) - frac{4}{2}=2 (integer) 7. **Count the Total Integer Results**: From the above steps, we see: - There are exactly 10 fractions that result in integers (considering each pair only once).

[ frac{(2m)!!}{k!!(2m-k)!!} le frac{(2m)!!}{(k+2)!!(2m-k-2)!!} ] Simplifying, we get: [ k+2 le 2m - k ] which is true. - **Lemma 2**: For all ( m ge 2 ), ( f(2m, m) < 2^m ) and ( f(2m, m+1) < 2^m ). - Base cases: [ f(4, 2) = frac{4 cdot 2}{2 cdot 2} = 2 < 2^2 ] [ f(4, 3) = frac{4 cdot 2}{3 cdot 1} = frac{8}{3} < 2^2 ] [ f(6, 3) = frac{6 cdot 4 cdot 2}{3 cdot 3} = frac{48}{9} < 2^3 ] [ f(6, 4) = frac{6 cdot 4 cdot 2}{4 cdot 2 cdot 2} = frac{48}{16} = 3 < 2^3 ] - Inductive step: [ f(2m+4, m+2) = frac{(2m+4)(2m+2)}{(m+2)^2} cdot f(2m, m) < 4 cdot f(2m, m) < 2^{m+2} ] [ f(2m+4, m+3) = frac{(2m+4)(2m+2)}{(m+3)(m+1)} cdot f(2m, m+1) < 4 cdot f(2m, m+1) < 2^{m+2} ] - **Corollary**: ( f(2m, k) < 2^m ) for any ( 0 le k le 2m ) and ( m ge 2 ). - Since ( f(n, k) = f(n, n-k) ), we assume ( 0 le k le m ). Using Lemma 1, ( f(n, k) ) never decreases. The algorithm terminates at ( k = m ) or ( k = m+1 ), so: [ f(2m, k) le max{f(2m, m), f(2m, m+1)} < 2^m ] - For ( n = 2m ) and odd ( k ), ( f(n, k) = frac{2^m cdot m!}{k!!(2m-k)!!} ) is an integer if and only if the denominator divides the numerator. Since the denominator is odd, it must divide ( m! ). But ( frac{f(n, k)}{2^m} ) is between 0 and 1, so it cannot be an integer. Thus, ( f(2m, k) ) is not an integer for odd ( k ) and ( m ge 2 ). 6. **Special case ( m = 1 )**: For ( n = 2 ) and ( k = 1 ): [ f(2, 1) = frac{2!!}{1!! cdot 1!!} = 2 ] which is an integer. Therefore, ( f(n, k) ) is an integer exactly when ( 0 le k le n ) satisfy one of the following cases: - ( k = 0 ) or ( k = n ), - ( n ) and ( k ) are both even, - ( (n, k) = (2, 1) ). The final answer is ( boxed{ (n, k) } ) pairs such that ( k = 0 ) or ( k = n ), or both ( n ) and ( k ) are even, or ((n, k) = (2, 1))."},{"prompt":"f 2 divided by a rational number equals 8, then this rational number is ______.","completion":"To solve the given problem, we start by understanding the relationship between division and the rational number in question.

Hence, the sides of the rectangle can be represented as (a + bsqrt{3}) and (c + dsqrt{3}), where (a, b, c,) and (d) are non-negative integers. 4. **Rectangle Area Calculation:** - The area of the rectangle (R) can be expressed as: [ R = (a + b sqrt{3})(c + d sqrt{3}) = (ac + 3bd) + (ad + bc)sqrt{3} ] 5. **Area Multiplicity and Equation Formation:** - To ensure that the area is a multiple of (S), the imaginary part must be zero: [ ad + bc = 0 ] - For (ad + bc = 0), either both (a = c = 0) or (b = d = 0). This arises because each product must be zero given non-negative integers (a, b, c,) and (d). 6. **Implications on Rectangle Sides:** - If (a = 0) or (c = 0) and similarly (b = 0) or (d = 0): - This means one side ((a + bsqrt{3}) or (c + d sqrt{3})) must be a whole number, and the other side must be a multiple of (sqrt{3}). Hence, the area of the rectangle should be a multiple of (2S). 7. **Contradiction via Parity:** - Since the area of the hexagon is (3S), the number of triangles in the tiling is odd. - Considering interior segments splitting the hexagon, specifically segments of length (sqrt{3}). Due to each triangle having one segment of (sqrt{3}) and external rectangle sides being integers, the interior must total an even number of segments. - If the number of interior segments of ((sqrt{3})) are even while requiring them to resolve into triangles correctly implies the need for even segments, leading to a contradiction given our earlier integer side constraints and partition assumptions necessitating an odd triangle count. # Conclusion: From the contradiction in the even-odd argument, it follows that it is **impossible** to cut a rectangle into a regular hexagon with a side length of 1 along with several right-angled triangles with legs 1 and (sqrt{3}).

By the AM-GM inequality, we have: [frac{|a|+|b|}{2} geq sqrt{|ab|}] Since ab neq 0, we know that a and b are both nonzero, so we can square both sides and simplify: [frac{a^2+2|ab|+b^2}{4} geq ab] [frac{a^2+b^2}{4} geq ab- frac{|ab|}{2}] Now, recall that a^2+b^2 leq a^2+4b^2 = 9. Thus, [frac{a^2+b^2}{4} leq frac{9}{4}] Combining these inequalities, we obtain: [frac{9}{4} geq frac{a^2+b^2}{4} geq ab- frac{|ab|}{2}] To maximize ab-frac{|ab|}{2}, we should minimize |ab|. Since ab neq 0, the smallest possible value for |ab| is when |a|=1 and |b|=2 (or vice versa), which satisfies the equality condition in the AM-GM inequality. In this case, |ab|=2, and ab-frac{|ab|}{2}=1. Thus, the maximum possible value for frac{a^2+b^2}{4} is frac{9}{4}, which occurs when frac{a^2+b^2}{4}=ab-frac{|ab|}{2}=1. Now, let's find the minimum value of frac{1}{a^{2}}+frac{1}{b^{2}} given that frac{a^2+b^2}{4}=1. Multiplying both sides by frac{4}{a^2b^2}, we get: [frac{4}{a^2}+frac{4}{b^2}=frac{4}{a^2b^2}] Adding frac{1}{a^2}+frac{1}{b^2} to both sides, we obtain: [frac{5}{a^2}+frac{5}{b^2}=frac{4}{a^2b^2}+frac{1}{a^2}+frac{1}{b^2}] To minimize frac{5}{a^2}+frac{5}{b^2}, we need to maximize frac{4}{a^2b^2}+frac{1}{a^2}+frac{1}{b^2}. By the AM-GM inequality, we have: [frac{frac{4}{a^2b^2}+frac{1}{a^2}+frac{1}{b^2}}{3} geq sqrt[3]{frac{4}{a^6b^6}}=frac{2}{a^2b^2}] Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: [frac{4}{a^2b^2}+frac{1}{a^2}+frac{1}{b^2} geq frac{6}{a^2b^2}] Thus, the minimum possible value for frac{5}{a^2}+frac{5}{b^2} is frac{6}{a^2b^2}, which occurs when frac{4}{a^2b^2}+frac{1}{a^2}+frac{1}{b^2}=frac{6}{a^2b^2}. In this case, we have frac{5}{a^2}+frac{5}{b^2}=frac{6}{a^2b^2}. To find the minimum value of frac{1}{a^{2}}+frac{1}{b^{2}}, we can set frac{5}{a^2}+frac{5}{b^2}=frac{6}{a^2b^2} and solve for frac{1}{a^{2}}+frac{1}{b^{2}}. Multiplying both sides by a^2b^2, we obtain: [5a^2b^2+5a^2b^2=6a^2+6b^2] Dividing both sides by 5, we get: [a^2b^2+a^2b^2=frac{6}{5}(a^2+b^2)] Now, recall that a^2+b^2 leq a^2+4b^2 = 9. Thus, [a^2b^2+a^2b^2 leq frac{6}{5}(a^2+4b^2)=frac{6}{5}(9)=10.8] To minimize frac{1}{a^{2}}+frac{1}{b^{2}}, we need to maximize a^2b^2+a^2b^2. The maximum possible value for a^2b^2+a^2b^2 is 10.8, which occurs when a^2+b^2=9 and a^2b^2+a^2b^2=frac{6}{5}(a^2+b^2)=10.8. In this case, we have a^2b^2=5.4 and a^2+b^2=9. Now, let's find the minimum value of frac{1}{a^{2}}+frac{1}{b^{2}} given that a^2b^2=5.4 and a^2+b^2=9. Multiplying both sides of a^2+b^2=9 by frac{1}{a^2b^2}, we get: [frac{1}{b^2}+frac{1}{a^2}=frac{9}{a^2b^2}] Substituting a^2b^2=5.4, we obtain: [frac{1}{b^2}+frac{1}{a^2}=frac{9}{5.4}=boxed{1}]"},{"prompt":"Given point A(3a+2,2a4), find the coordinates of point A according to the following conditions:<br/>(1) The line passing through points A(3a+2,2a4) and B(3,4) is parallel to the xaxis;<br/>(2) The distance from point A to both coordinate axes is equal.","completion":"To solve this problem, we break it down into the two given conditions: **Condition (1): The line passing through points A(3a+2,2a-4) and B(3,4) is parallel to the x-axis.** Since the line is parallel to the x-axis, the y-coordinates (ordinates) of points A and B must be equal.

This is because the frogs continuously jump into neighboring sectors, ensuring that at least one of the two sectors involved in the jump has a frog. 3. **Case Examination**: - If in a certain moment, a sector with frogs has only 1 frog or at least 3 frogs, it will still have frogs at the next moment because: - If there is 1 frog, it doesn't make any jumps. - If there are at least 3 frogs, at least one frog remains in that sector due to the jumping mechanism. - If a sector has exactly 2 frogs, at the next moment, both adjacent sectors to it will each have at least 1 frog. 4. **Proof of Existence of Frogs in All Sectors**: - To demonstrate that at least half of the sectors always have a frog, we use a proof by contradiction. - **Assume** at a time textit{t}, there is a sector ( A ) with no frogs indefinitely. - Number the sectors in a sequential clockwise order starting from ( A ) as 1, 2, ldots, n. - Assign each frog to the sector number it's currently in. 5. **Sum of Squared Indices**: - Let ( S ) be the sum of the squares of the indices of the frogs: [ S = sum_{i=1}^{n+1} k_i^2 ] where ( k_i ) is the index of the sector in which the i-th frog is. - Note: Sectors 1 and 2 will never both have more than 1 frog simultaneously because otherwise, a frog would jump into sector A initially assumed to be devoid of frogs. 6. **Jump Effect on S**: Suppose a sector k (where 3 leq k leq n-1) that contains exactly two frogs, during a jump: [ (k-1)^2 + (k+1)^2 - 2k^2 = k^2 - 2k + 1 + k^2 + 2k + 1 - 2k^2 = 2 ] So, each such frog jump increases S by 2. 7. **Contradiction in Unlimited Increase**: Considering infinite jumps: - S would grow indefinitely. - But S is initially a finite, calculable number as it is based on the total number of frogs (n+1) and their initial locations. - This leads to a contradiction as S can’t increase without bound in a finite system. 8. **Conclusion**: This contradiction means that our assumption of any sector being forever excluded from having frogs is false.

Let the number of k-sided polygons (regions) be n_k where k = 3, 4, ldots, m, and m is the highest number of sides of regions. 3. The internal angle sum of a k-sided polygon is (k-2) cdot 180^circ.

It is known that line C I bisects segment A_{2} B_{2}. Is it true that triangle A B C is isosceles?","completion":"1. We are given that the angle angle C in triangle ABC is 120^circ. Let CI be the angle bisector of angle C, intersecting AB at C_1. Thus, CI is the internal angle bisector, splitting angle C = 120^circ into two angles of 60^circ. 2. Since C_1 is on the angle bisector, angle ACB is separated into two equal parts by the bisector CI. Thus, [ angle ACI = angle ICB = 60^circ ] 3. Now, consider triangle AIA_1 and triangle BIB_1 such that A_1 and B_1 lie on the bisectors AI and BI, respectively, and it is given that the isosceles triangles IA_2A_1 and IB_1B_2 are constructed such that A_2 and B_2 lie on AB. 4. Since angle C = 120^circ, each angle bisector of triangle ABC maintains the symmetry condition. This leads us to infer certain symmetrical properties through the bisectors and points I, A_1, and B_1. 5. The given information states that CI bisects A_2B_2. Due to the isosceles property and angle bisector positioning, it can be reasoned geometrically that [ IA_1 = IB_1 ] and correspondingly, [ angle IA_1J = 2 angle AA_1C = 2 times 30^circ = 60^circ ] 6. Since triangle AIA_1 and triangle BIB_1 define two congruent sub-triangles and angle A_1I B_1 = 120^circ - 2 cdot 30^circ = 60^circ symmetry along CI ensures angle IA_1J = angle IA_1J = 60^circ, indicative of [ angle IAI = angle IA_1I = 120^circ - 2 times 30^circ = 60^circ ] 7. Then IA_1 J being part of the isosceles triangle with conditions I A_1 = I J strongly implies, given the angle bisector theorem and the properties of A_2 overlapping with J. 8. Analogously, symmetry in triangle AIB and IA_2I = IB_2I leads to the conclusion that A_2=J. 9. It follows that A_2C_1 = J C_1 = I C_1. And equivalently for B_2, we observe B_2C_1 = I C_1 which establishes a firm geometric symmetry along the bisectors. # Conclusion: Therefore, the property that A_2 and B_2 on line AB with symmetric division by CI does not hold true unless C angle were 120^circ, incorrectly concluding that triangle ABC can entail such generic geometric constraints purely for an arbitrary angle C = 120^circ without direct relation.

We want to further analyze the expressions by defining a function (f(z)): f(z) := || z-y|-x|. 3. **Simplifying the Problem Using (f(z))**: With (f(z)), the original equation transforms into: f^{1009}(x) = left| f^{1009}(0) - y right|. 4. **Analyzing the Function (f(z))**: For (z in [0, y]), we can write (f(z)) in piecewise form: f(z) = left{ begin{array}{ll} d - z, & text{if } 0 leq z leq d, z - d, & text{if } d < z leq y. end{array} right. 5. **Investigating (f(f(z)))**: Evaluating (f(f(z))) for (z in [0, d]): [ f(f(z)) = f(d - z) = z. ] This indicates that (f(f(z)) = z) for all (z in [0, d]). 6. **Delving Into Iterative Application of (f(z))**: Consequently: [ left| f^{1009}(0) - y right| = |f(0) - y| = x. ] 7. **Condition When (x > d)**: If (x > d), then: [ f^{1009}(x) < x. ] This leads to an inconsistency where if (f^{1009}(x) leq d), the conclusion trivially holds; but if (f^{1009}(x) > d), we conclude: [ left. f^{1009}(x) = x - 1009d < x. ] 8. **Deriving (x leq d)**: Therefore, the condition (x leq d) (or (x leq y - x)) must hold.

Determine which are more frequent: numbers that contain the digit 1 or numbers that do not contain the digit 1 in their decimal representation. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Determine the Total Number of Numbers:** We need to count the total number of numbers from 1 to 10,000,000,000. This range includes (10^{10}) numbers because it spans from 1 to (10^{10}). 2. **Identify the Numbers that Do Not Contain the Digit 1:** To solve this, we will consider the count of numbers that do not contain the digit 1 in their decimal representation. Consider numbers with exactly 10 digits. Every digit can be any of (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) (9 possible digits).

So, the actual count of such numbers is: [ 9^{10} - 1 ] 4. **Calculate the Number of Numbers that Contain the Digit 1:** Subtract the count of numbers that do not contain the digit 1 from the total count of numbers: [ 10^{10} - (9^{10} - 1) ] Simplifying the expression: [ 10^{10} - 9^{10} + 1 ] 5. **Compute the Exact Values:** First, calculate (9^{10}): [ 9^{10} = 3486784401 ] Then: [ 9^{10} - 1 = 3486784400 ] Total count of numbers that contain the digit 1: [ 10^{10} - 3486784400 = 6513215600 ] # Conclusion: Thus, the number of numbers from 1 to 10,000,000,000 in which the digit 1 appears is 6,513,215,600, and the number of numbers in which the digit 1 does not appear is 3,486,784,400.

Each green square is connected by streets to the blue square and to two other green squares. We assume that there is one-way traffic on each of the 2n streets such that each square can be accessed and exited. We need to prove that from each square in the city, one can reach any of the other squares without violating traffic rules. 2. **Proving Part (a) - Reaching the Blue Square from Any Green Square:** Let us assume there is a green square ( A_1 ) from which it is impossible to reach the blue square. Because we can leave ( A_1 ), by driving on one street, we reach another green square ( A_2 ). Since we assume ( A_1 ) can't reach the blue square, neither can ( A_2 ). Continuing this way, from ( A_2 ) we drive further, reaching another green square ( A_3 ), and so on. After traveling through ( n ) streets, we end up back at ( A_1 ), forming a cycle among the green squares. Since ( A_1 ) can't reach the blue square, neither can any green square in this cycle. However, the setup and the presence of exactly one-way traffic to and from each square imply that there must be a path from some green squares to the blue square, contradicting our initial assumption. This contradiction proves that every green square can indeed reach the blue square. 3. **Proving Part (b) - Reaching Any Green Square from the Blue Square:** Now, let's reverse the directions of all the one-way streets in the city. In this modified scheme, each street direction is the opposite of its original. According to part (a), in the reversed setup, every green square (now with altered street directions) can still reach the blue square. Reversing the directions back again implies that, originally, from the blue square, it must be possible to reach any green square. # Conclusion: As proved above, (a) every green square can drive to the blue square and (b) reversing street directions shows that from the blue square, one can reach any green square initially.

Since all members of this geometric progression are also members of some arithmetic progression, there exist constants (a) and (c) such that: [ frac{b r^{n-1} - c}{a} in mathbb{Z} quad forall n geq 1 ] This implies that (b r^{n-1} - c) is divisible by (a) for all (n). 2. Define (c_k := frac{b}{a}(1 - r^k)). We need to show that (c_k r^n) is an integer for all (n in mathbb{N} cup {0}) and (k in mathbb{N}). Consider: [ c_k r^n = frac{b}{a}(1 - r^k) r^n = frac{b r^n - b r^{n+k}}{a} ] Since (frac{b r^n - c}{a}) and (frac{b r^{n+k} - c}{a}) are both integers, their difference is also an integer: [ frac{b r^n - c}{a} - frac{b r^{n+k} - c}{a} = frac{b r^n - b r^{n+k}}{a} = c_k r^n in mathbb{Z} ] 3. Since (c_k r^n) is an integer for all (n) and (k), we conclude that (r) must be a rational number. To see why, assume (r = frac{p}{q}) in lowest terms where (p) and (q) are coprime integers. If (r) were not an integer, then (q > 1). 4. Fix (k) and consider the (q)-adic valuation (nu_q) of (r). Suppose (nu_q(r) < 0) for some prime (q). Then: [ nu_q(c_k r^n) = nu_qleft(frac{b}{a}(1 - r^k) r^nright) = nu_qleft(frac{b}{a}right) + nu_q(1 - r^k) + n nu_q(r) ] As (n to infty), (n nu_q(r) to -infty), which contradicts the fact that (c_k r^n) is always an integer. Therefore, (nu_q(r) geq 0) for all primes (q), implying (r) is an integer. 5. Since (r) is an integer and (b) is an integer, all terms (b r^{n-1}) of the geometric progression are integers.

Then there exists a constant ( D ) such that for any point ( P in l_1 ), and its projection ( P' ) onto line ( l_2 ), the following inequality holds: [ |Q P'| leq |Q P| cos varphi + D ] 3. **Proof of Lemma:** - Let ( P_0 ) be a fixed point on line ( l_1 ). Then we can write: [ |Q P'| leq |Q P_0'| + |P_0'P'| ] - Since ( P_0 ) is fixed, ( P_0' ) is a fixed projection point on ( l_2 ). The term ( |P_0'P'| ) can be bounded as: [ |P_0'P'| = |P_0 P| cos varphi ] - Therefore, we have: [ |Q P'| leq |Q P_0'| + |P_0 P| cos varphi ] - Next, noting that ( |P_0 P| leq |Q P_0| + |Q P| ), we can further bound ( |Q P'| ): [ |Q P'| leq |Q P_0'| + (|Q P_0| + |Q P|) cos varphi ] - Introducing ( D = |Q P_0'| + |Q P_0| cos varphi ), we get: [ |Q P'| leq D + |Q P| cos varphi ] 4. **Corollary:** There exists a number ( R = R(l_1, l_2, Q) ), depending on ( l_1, l_2 ), and ( Q ), such that if ( |Q P| < R ), then ( |Q P'| < R ). 5. **Choosing ( R ):** Observe that ( D ) and (cos varphi ) are constants for the fixed lines and diagrams involving angle ( varphi ). Therefore, ( R ) can be efficiently chosen as: [ R = frac{D}{1 - cos varphi} ] 6. **Construction of the Sphere:** - Let ( O_i ) represent the projection of point ( O ) onto line ( l_i ). - Define ( R_1 = max_i |O O_i| ). - Define ( R_2 = max_{i, j} R(l_i, l_j, O) ). - Finally, let ( R = max (R_1, R_2) ). 7. **Conclusion:** The sphere of radius ( R ) centered at point ( O ) will contain all the points obtained through the specified orthogonal projections and their iterations.

To solve for all positive integers ( k ) such that the equation [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = k cdot a cdot b cdot c ] has a solution in positive integers ((a, b, c)), let us assume that there exists such ( k ). We start by examining properties of this equation. 2. **Lemma** - For any non-zero integers ( a, b, c ), the equation ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = k cdot a cdot b cdot c ) does not hold if ( k ) is even. - **Proof of Lemma**: Assume otherwise, and suppose ((a, b, c)) are such that (|a| + |b| + |c|) is minimized, with ( k ) an even number. Since ( k ) is even, at least one of ( a, b, c ) must be even. Because the sum of the squares of integers modulo 4 is either 0 or 1, all three ( a, b, c ) must be even. Let ( a = 2a_1 ), ( b = 2b_1 ), ( c = 2c_1 ) where ( a_1, b_1, c_1 ) are integers. Substituting these into the equation: [ (2a_1)^2 + (2b_1)^2 + (2c_1)^2 = k cdot (2a_1) cdot (2b_1) cdot (2c_1) ] Simplifying, we get: [ 4a_1^2 + 4b_1^2 + 4c_1^2 = 8k a_1 b_1 c_1 ] Dividing by 4, we obtain: [ a_1^2 + b_1^2 + c_1^2 = 2k a_1 b_1 c_1 ] This results in a contradiction because (|a_1| + |b_1| + |c_1| < |a| + |b| + |c|), violating the minimality assumption. Hence, ( k ) must be odd. 3. Fixing ( k ), assume that ((a, b, c)) is a solution such that ( a leq b leq c ). Rewriting the equation: [ c^2 - k a b c + (a^2 + b^2) = 0 ] Let the other root be ( c' ).

Proof: Since a_1=1, a_n neq 0, and lambda S_n = a_n a_{n+1} + 1, where lambda is a constant. For n geq 2, we have lambda S_{n-1} = a_{n-1} a_n + 1, thus lambda a_n = a_n (a_{n+1} - a_{n-1}), Therefore, a_{n+1} - a_{n-1} = lambda. Replacing n with 2n, we get a_{2n+1} - a_{2n-1} = lambda, which is a constant, Thus, the sequence {a_{2n-1}} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term being 1 and the common difference lambda; 2. Solution: From lambda S_n = a_n a_{n+1} + 1, for n=1, we get lambda = a_2 + 1, Then a_2 = lambda - 1, thus a_2 - a_1 = lambda - 2. Assuming there exists a real number lambda such that {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, then lambda - 2 = frac{1}{2}lambda, solving this gives lambda = 4. Therefore, when lambda = 4, (a_{n+1} - a_n) + (a_n - a_{n-1}) = 4, which means a_{n+1} - a_n = 2, Thus, {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term being 1 and the common difference 2. 3. Since {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, from (2) we know: a_n = 1 + 2(n-1) = 2n - 1. Thus, b_n = (-1)^{n-1} frac{4n}{a_n a_{n+1}} = (-1)^{n-1} cdot frac{4n}{(2n-1)(2n+1)} = (-1)^{n-1}left( frac{1}{2n-1} + frac{1}{2n+1}right), Therefore, when n=2k, The sum of the first n terms of the sequence b_n, T_n = left(1+ frac{1}{3}right) - left( frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{5}right) + left( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{7}right) - ldots + left( frac{1}{2n-3} + frac{1}{2n-1}right) - left( frac{1}{2n-1} + frac{1}{2n+1}right) = 1 - frac{1}{2n+1} = frac{2n}{2n+1}.

We are allowed to choose any (3 times 3) or (4 times 4) subgrid and increment each number within the chosen subgrid by one. The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all 64 numbers in the grid multiples of 10 using a limited number of such operations. 2. **Analyzing the Grid Structure:** Let's denote (S) as the sum of the numbers in the cells of the grid that are shaded (as depicted in some hypothetical figure “2-10” or similar example provided). Note that our operations involve selecting subgrids and adding to all of their elements. 3. **Behavior of Shaded Cells During Operations:** Each (3 times 3) and (4 times 4) subgrid operation affects the number of shaded cells within it. Importantly: [ 3 times 3 text{ grid: can contain 2, 4, or 6 shaded cells} ] [ 4 times 4 text{ grid: can contain 4, 8, or 12 shaded cells} ] Hence, each operation on any subgrid containing shaded cells will always increase the sum (S) (the total of all numbers in shaded cells) by an even number. 4. **Initial Sum Condition and Parity Argument:** Let's assume the shaded cells represent a specific part of the (8 times 8) grid such that their initial sum (S) is odd (since this ensures we have a discrepancy in parity that we can leverage for proof).

Let us denote: - ( E ) as the number of watermelons eaten by one elephant. - ( H ) as the number of watermelons eaten by one hippo. Using the given data, we can set up the equations: [ 5E + 7H = 31 ] [ 8E + 4H = 28 ] 3. We solve these simultaneous equations to determine ( E ) and ( H ).

To determine which animal is picky and what type of watermelon they prefer, we analyze the specific details on the type of watermelon: - In the first group, hippos in total eat ( 7 times 3 = 21 ) watermelons, but 21 is more than 11 (the quantity of round watermelons) and less than 31 (the total number, thus including cubic ones). - Therefore, hippos must eat all types of watermelons. 8. Next, consider elephants: - From the second group, elephants eat ( 8 times 2 = 16 ) watermelons. Since only 8 cubic watermelons are present (less than 16), elephants must eat only the round watermelons to make up their consumption. # Conclusion: The detailed solution identifies that: - Hippos eat all types of watermelons (both round and cubic). - Elephants only prefer round watermelons.

To find out how many that is, we calculate 40% of 62: 40% of 62 = 0.40 * 62 = 24.8 Since we can't have a fraction of a player, we'll round this number to the nearest whole number. In this case, we'll round down because you can't have 0.8 of a player, so there are 24 left-handed players.

For ( n = 8 ), we have: [ 8, 6, 4, 2, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8, 3, 5, 7, 3, 1, 1, 5 ] Prove that such a sequence does not exist if the remainder of ( n ) when divided by 4 is 2 or 3. 1. **Number Positions and Sequence Construction**: - Number the positions in the sequence with integers ( 1, 2, 3, ldots, 2n ). - If the first occurrence of number ( r ) is at position ( p_r ), the second occurrence of ( r ) will be at position ( p_r + r ). 2. **Sum of Position Indices**: - The sum of indices for the positions occupied by all pairs is: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 2n = frac{2n(2n+1)}{2} ] - On the other hand, summing the positions considering each number ( r ): [ sum_{i=1}^n (p_r + p_r + r) = sum_{i=1}^n (2p_r + r) ] Hence, we'd get: [ = 2(p_1 + p_2 + ldots + p_n) + (1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + n) ] 3. **Equating Sum of Position Indices**: - Since these two sums must match, we get: [ frac{2n(2n+1)}{2} = 2(p_1 + p_2 + ldots + p_n) + frac{n(n + 1)}{2} ] - Let ( P ) denote the sum of the first occurrences: [ P = p_1 + p_2 + ldots + p_n ] so we have: [ frac{2n(2n+1)}{2} = 2P + frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] 4. **Solving for ( P )**: - Solving for ( P ): [ frac{2n(2n+1)}{2} = 2P + frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] [ 2n(2n+1) = 4P + n(n+1) ] [ 4P = 2n(2n+1) - n(n+1) ] [ 4P = 2n(2n + 1) - n(n + 1) ] [ 4P = 4n^2 + 2n - n^2 - n ] [ 4P = 3n^2 + n ] - Hence: [ P = frac{3n^2 + n}{4} ] 5. **Divisibility Condition**: - For ( P ) to be an integer, ( frac{3n^2 + n}{4} ) must also be an integer. - Therefore, ( n(3n + 1) ) must be divisible by 4. 6. **Modulus Condition**: - If ( n equiv 2 pmod{4} ) or ( n equiv 3 pmod{4} ): - **Case ( n equiv 2 pmod{4} )**: [ n = 4k + 2 ] [ 3n + 1 = 3(4k + 2) + 1 = 12k + 7 ] [ n(3n + 1) = (4k + 2)(12k + 7) ] Examining modulo 4: [ n(3n + 1) equiv 2 cdot 3 cdot 2 + 2 equiv 14 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] - **Case ( n equiv 3 pmod{4} )**: [ n = 4k + 3 ] [ 3n + 1 = 3(4k + 3) + 1 = 12k + 10 ] [ n(3n + 1) = (4k + 3)(12k + 10) ] Examining modulo 4: [ n(3n + 1) equiv 3 cdot 3 + 2 equiv 2 pmod{4} ] Therefore, both cases lead to ( n(3n + 1) equiv 2 pmod{4} ), which implies ( P ) is not an integer.

Therefore, the price after the markup is x + 0.3x = (1 + 0.3)x = 1.3x. 2. **Applying a 10% discount:** After marking up the price, a 10% discount is applied. The discount is 10% of the marked-up price, which is 0.1 times 1.3x = 0.13x. The selling price after the discount is the marked-up price minus the discount, which is 1.3x - 0.13x = (1.3 - 0.13)x = 1.17x. 3. **Calculating the profit:** The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is 1.17x - x = 0.17x. 4. **Setting up the equation:** According to the problem, the profit made on each item is 34 yuan. Therefore, we can set up the equation as 0.17x = 34. However, to closely align with the provided solution, we should consider the correct approach as follows: - The selling price after applying a 10% discount on the marked-up price is 0.9 times (1 + 30%)x = 0.9 times 1.3x = 1.17x. - The profit is then the selling price minus the cost price, which gives us 1.17x - x = 0.17x = 34.

We are given that DC is perpendicular to the plane ABC, angle ACB = 60^{circ}, AB = 3sqrt{2}, and DC = 2sqrt{3}. Our goal is to find the surface area of the sphere O. First, we focus on triangle ABC and use the given angle angle ACB = 60^{circ} and side AB = 3sqrt{2} to find the radius r of the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The formula for the diameter of the circumcircle of a triangle, given one side and the opposite angle, is 2r = frac{text{side}}{sin(text{opposite angle})}. Applying this formula, we get: [2r = frac{AB}{sinangle ACB} = frac{3sqrt{2}}{sin 60^{circ}} = frac{3sqrt{2}}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = 2sqrt{6}] From this, we find that the radius r of the circumcircle of triangle ABC is: [r = sqrt{6}] Next, we consider the sphere O that circumscribes the pyramid D-ABC. The radius R of this sphere can be found by considering the right triangle formed by the radius R, the radius r of the circumcircle of the base ABC, and half of DC (since the center of the sphere is directly above the center of the circumcircle of the base ABC). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have: [R^{2} = r^{2} + left(frac{DC}{2}right)^{2} = 6 + left(frac{2sqrt{3}}{2}right)^{2} = 6 + 3 = 9] Thus, the radius R of the circumscribed sphere is: [R = sqrt{9} = 3] Finally, the surface area S of the sphere O is given by the formula S = 4pi R^{2}.

Since he returned on a road that was 2 kilometers longer, the return distance would be ( D + 2 ) kilometers. The time taken to go to the city hall is ( frac{D}{3} ) hours, because he rode at 3 km/h. The time taken to return home is ( frac{D + 2}{4} ) hours, because he rode at 4 km/h. According to the problem, the total time for the round trip is 4 hours.

Substituting x = frac{pi}{b_k} into the inequality, we get: [ cosleft(a_k frac{pi}{b_k}right) + cos(pi) geq -frac{1}{k} ] 5. Since cos(pi) = -1, the inequality becomes: [ cosleft(frac{a_k pi}{b_k}right) - 1 geq -frac{1}{k} ] 6. Rearranging the terms, we get: [ cosleft(frac{a_k pi}{b_k}right) geq 1 - frac{1}{k} ] 7. Since cos(theta) leq 1 for all theta, we have: [ 1 geq cosleft(frac{a_k pi}{b_k}right) geq 1 - frac{1}{k} ] 8. As k to infty, 1 - frac{1}{k} to 1. Therefore, cosleft(frac{a_k pi}{b_k}right) to 1. 9. The cosine function approaches 1 when its argument approaches 0. Hence, frac{a_k pi}{b_k} to 0 as k to infty. 10. This implies: [ frac{a_k}{b_k} to 0 text{ as } k to infty ] 11. To formalize this, we use the fact that arccos(1 - frac{1}{k}) to 0 as k to infty. Therefore: [ frac{a_k pi}{b_k} leq arccosleft(1 - frac{1}{k}right) ] 12. Dividing both sides by pi, we get: [ frac{a_k}{b_k} leq frac{1}{pi} arccosleft(1 - frac{1}{k}right) ] 13. As k to infty, arccosleft(1 - frac{1}{k}right) to 0, so: [ frac{a_k}{b_k} to 0 ] The final answer is boxed{0}"},{"prompt":"Point P(4,3) is first translated 2 units to the left and then 2 units down to point P'.

This ensures that within each triple, the pairs ( (X_i, Y_i) ), ( (Y_i, Z_i) ), and ( (Z_i, X_i) ) make presents to the third child in the triple. 3. **Forming Additional Triples:** For ( i neq j ), if ( k ) is equal to ( frac{i+j}{2} ) modulo ( n ), we form the following triples: [ (X_i, X_j, Y_k), quad (Y_i, Y_j, Z_k), quad (Z_i, Z_j, X_k) ] This step ensures that any two children labeled with the same letter (e.g., ( X )) are paired with a child labeled with a different letter (e.g., ( Y )). 4. **Verification of the Grouping:** Given two children ( X_a ) and ( Y_b ) (with ( a neq b )), we need to determine the third child in the triple. According to our construction, the third child is ( X_{2b-a} ). This is because: [ k = frac{a + b}{2} implies 2k = a + b implies k = frac{a + b}{2} pmod{n} ] Therefore, the triple ( (X_a, Y_b, X_{2b-a}) ) is well-defined.

Thus, the equation of ellipse C can be rewritten as: x^{2} + 3y^{2} = 3b^{2}. It is known that the coordinates of the right focus F are (sqrt {2}b, 0), according to the problem, the equation of the line AB is: y = x - sqrt {2}b.

Let A(x_{1}, y_{1}), B(x_{2}, y_{2}), and the midpoint N of chord AB be (x_{0}, y_{0}), by Vieta's formulas, we have: x_{0} = frac {x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} = frac {3 sqrt {2}b}{4}, y_{0} = x_{0} - sqrt {2}b = - frac { sqrt {2}}{4}b. Therefore, K_{ON} = frac {y_{0}}{x_{0}} = - frac {1}{3}, which is the required slope. (2) Obviously, overrightarrow {OA} and overrightarrow {OB} can serve as a basis for plane vectors. According to the basic theorem of plane vectors, for any vector overrightarrow {OM} in this plane, there exists a unique pair of real numbers lambda, mu, such that the equation overrightarrow {OM} = lambda overrightarrow {OA} + mu overrightarrow {OB} holds. Let M(x, y), from the coordinates of points in (1), we have: (x, y) = lambda (x_{1}, y_{1}) + mu (x_{2}, y_{2}), thus x = lambda x_{1} + mu x_{2}, y = lambda y_{1} + mu y_{2}. Since the point is on ellipse C, we have (lambda x_{1} + mu x_{2})^{2} + 3(lambda y_{1} + mu y_{2})^{2} = 3b^{2} which simplifies to lambda^{2}(x_{1}^{2} + 3y_{1}^{2}) + mu^{2}(x_{2}^{2} + 3y_{2}^{2}) + 2lambdamu(x_{1}x_{2} + 3y_{1}y_{2}) = 3b^{2}.

For every point M on the ellipse, there exists a pair of real numbers such that the equation overrightarrow {OM} = lambda overrightarrow {OA} + mu overrightarrow {OB} holds, and lambda^{2} + mu^{2} = 1.

The first player (Player 1) writes a letter in any square k. 2. **Second Player's Strategy**: The second player (Player 2) should choose a square l such that min(|l-1|, |l-2000|, |l-k|) > 3 and writes an 'S'. This ensures that no immediate 'SOS' can be formed and maintains a buffer around the 'S'. 3. **Continuation of Play**: Player 1 plays again in some square m. If Player 2 can complete 'SOS' directly on this turn, he should do so. If not, Player 2 should place another 'S' either at l + 3 if l > m or at l - 3 if l < m. This strategy starts to create isolated 'S' characters spaced out by more than one square, preventing Player 1 from forming 'SOS'. 4. **Blocking Strategy**: If any player places a letter between two isolated 'S's, the other player can immediately complete 'SOS'. Therefore, Player 2 should focus on maintaining and expanding this pattern, ensuring that any potential 'SOS' can be completed by him. 5. **Filling Strategy**: If Player 2 cannot directly form 'SOS', he should place an 'O' in any single empty square that is either surrounded by two filled squares or by two empty squares. This move prevents Player 1 from gaining a strategic advantage and forces the game towards a configuration favorable to Player 2. 6. **Endgame Strategy**: As the game progresses, the board will have pairs of empty squares. Since the total number of squares is even and Player 1 starts, Player 2 will always have the opportunity to respond directly to Player 1's moves in these pairs. Player 2 should continue to fill these pairs strategically to maintain control. 7. **Final Moves**: Eventually, the board will reach a state where all remaining empty squares are in pairs, with 'S's strategically placed to prevent Player 1 from forming 'SOS'. Player 1 will be forced to play in a square that allows Player 2 to complete 'SOS' on the subsequent move. 8. **Conclusion**: By following this strategy, Player 2 can always respond to Player 1's moves in a way that either directly leads to Player 2 winning or prevents Player 1 from winning, ultimately leading to a configuration where Player 2 can force a win.

We can draw lines connecting the midpoints of these segments pairwise: - Line ( L_{ab} ) connecting midpoints of ( a ) and ( b ) - Line ( L_{bc} ) connecting midpoints of ( b ) and ( c ) - Line ( L_{ac} ) connecting midpoints of ( a ) and ( c ) 3. **Perpendicularity Condition**: Each segment ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) is perpendicular to the lines originating from its midpoint. Specifically: - Segment ( a ) is perpendicular to both ( L_{ab} ) and ( L_{ac} ) - Segment ( b ) is perpendicular to both ( L_{ab} ) and ( L_{bc} ) - Segment ( c ) is perpendicular to both ( L_{bc} ) and ( L_{ac} ) 4. **Planarity of Connecting Lines**: Due to the perpendicularity condition discussed above, each segment ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) is perpendicular to the plane defined by the lines connecting its midpoint. Therefore, ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) must be perpendicular to the plane passing through the lines ( L_{ab}, L_{bc}, L_{ac} ). 5. **Contradiction**: Since the plane contains the lines ( L_{ab}, L_{bc}, L_{ac} ), and each segment is perpendicular to this plane, ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) must all be constrained to be perpendicular to the same plane. This implies that ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are, in fact, parallel to this plane, which contradicts our initial condition that no three of the ( n ) segments can be parallel to the same plane. Hence, the maximum value of ( n ) such that no three of these ( n ) segments are parallel to the same plane is ( n = 2 ). **Conclusion**: [ boxed{n = 2} ]"},{"prompt":"w many terms are in the arithmetic sequence 20, 25, 30, ..., 140? textbf{(A)} 23 qquadtextbf{(B)} 24 qquadtextbf{(C)} 25 qquadtextbf{(D)} 26 qquadtextbf{(E)} 27","completion":"1. **Identify the first term and common difference**: The given sequence starts at 20, and the next term is 25.

What is the expected number of consecutive digits that are not the same (that is, the expected number of occurrences of either 01 or 10 in the base 2 representation)?","completion":"To find the expected number of consecutive digits that are not the same in a randomly chosen integer between 0 and 4095, we need to follow these steps: 1. **Convert the Range and Define Variables:** Each integer between 0 and 4095 can be represented as a 12-digit binary string (since (2^{12} = 4096)). Let's denote a binary representation as (b_{12}b_{11}b_{10} ldots b_1b_0), where (b_{12}) is the most significant bit (leftmost). 2. **Introduce Random Variables:** Define (R_i) as a random variable which is 1 if the (i)-th and ((i+1))-st digits differ, and 0 otherwise. We need to compute (Eleft(sum_{i=1}^{11} R_iright)), which gives us the expected number of changes between consecutive bits in the 12-digit binary string. 3. **Use Linearity of Expectation:** By the linearity of expectation: [ Eleft(sum_{i=1}^{11} R_iright) = sum_{i=1}^{11} Eleft(R_iright) ] 4. **Calculate (Eleft(R_iright)):** Each (R_i) represents the event that two consecutive bits are different. The probability of (b_i neq b_{i+1}) is ( frac{1}{2} ) because for any bit, the next bit can either be 0 or 1 with equal probability. Therefore: [ Eleft(R_iright) = frac{1}{2} text{ for each } i ] 5. **Summing the Expectations:** Summing over all values of (i) from 1 to 11: [ sum_{i=1}^{11} Eleft(R_iright) = 11 cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{11}{2} ] 6. **Adjust for Leading Zero:** We need to consider if the leading digit (b_{12}) is zero (the possibility that the number is 0, which would affect the count of changes). However, this happens with a probability of (frac{1}{2}) for the first digit. If the leading digit is zero, none of the following changes count unless the entire string is all zeros. - Probability of all digits being zero is (frac{1}{4096}). - Therefore, we subtract (frac{1}{2}) from (frac{11}{2}) to account for the half probability of leading zero and add back (frac{1}{4096}) to avoid complete exclusion due to (0)-only possibility. 7. **Finalize the Expected Value:** Combining these elements: [ frac{11}{2} - frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4096} = 5 + frac{1}{4096} ] 8. **Conclusion:** Simplifying this, we get: [ 5 + frac{1}{4096} = frac{20480}{4096} + frac{1}{4096} = frac{20481}{4096} ] Thus, the expected number of consecutive digits that are not the same in the base 2 representation of a random integer between 0 and 4095 is: [ boxed{frac{20481}{4096}} ]"},{"prompt":"Consider two squares, each with side length 2.

The coordinates of B' after rotation by theta where cos theta = frac{3}{5} (and hence, sin theta = sqrt{1 - cos^2 theta} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{3}{5}right)^2} = frac{4}{5}) are: [B' = (2cos theta, 2sin theta) = left(2 cdot frac{3}{5}, 2 cdot frac{4}{5}right) = left(frac{6}{5}, frac{8}{5}right).] As both squares have the same center and size, the sides of the squares intersect at points that we calculate next.

After they pass each other, they continue to the opposite shores. Boat M will have D - 500 yards left to travel to reach shore B, and boat B will have 500 yards left to travel to reach shore A. When they reach the opposite shores, they turn around and start heading back towards each other.

Note: Solutions that prove the statement for ( c sqrt{n} ) instead of ( sqrt{n} ) will also be awarded points, depending on the value of the constant ( c ).","completion":"We need to prove that for any sufficiently large ( n ), we can color at least ( sqrt{n} ) lines blue from any set of ( n ) lines in general position, such that no finite region has all its edges colored blue. 1. **Initial Setup**: - Begin with all ( n ) lines being black. - Color a line red if it can no longer be colored blue. 2. **Base Case**: - For ( k = 1 ), we can color one line blue, and since there are initially no blue lines, there's no risk of creating a finite region with two adjacent blue lines. As there are no such regions yet, we don't need to color any line red, ensuring no conditions are violated at this step. 3. **Inductive Step**: - Suppose we have been able to color ( k-1 ) lines blue with at most ( (k-1)^2 - (k-1) ) lines colored red. - Select a ( k )-th black line to color blue. We need to ensure the newly formed blue line doesn't create any finite region with two adjacent blue sides without a red side. 4. **Ensuring Conditions After Coloring ( k )-th Blue Line**: - Identify regions where the new blue line intersects previous ( k-1 ) blue lines. For these regions: - Determine the intersection points of the new blue line with each of the previous blue lines. - If a segment between two intersection points contains no other blue line, color the lines forming these segments red. - If these segments already intersect a red line or do not form a bounded region without a red line, the requirements are upheld. 5. **Number of Red Lines**: - Adding a new blue line might require coloring two to ( k-1 ) lines red. - This maintains the invariant: after coloring ( k ) lines blue, at most ( k^2 - k ) lines will be red because we've ensured: - For each blue line, at most ( 2(k-1) ) new red lines. 6. **Continuation**: - Repeating this argument allows us to continue coloring additional blue lines, up to ( k = sqrt{n} ), while ensuring that each finite bounded region with adjacent blue sides also has a red side.

Assume ( x geqslant y ); if not, we can interchange ( x ) and ( y ) to see that the left-hand side of the inequality increases, keeping the inequality valid. From the given condition, ( x, y leqslant 1 ) follows directly. Let us introduce new variables ( u = x^{6} ) and ( v = y^{6} ).

The two faces that are length by depth (L x D) Given: Length (L) = 5 meters Width (W) = 4 meters Depth (D) = 1 meter Now we calculate the area of each pair of faces: 1. The area of one face that is length by width: A1 = L x W = 5 m x 4 m = 20 m² Since there are two such faces, the total area for these faces is: Total A1 = 2 x A1 = 2 x 20 m² = 40 m² 2.

Since the ratio of food consumption between adults and children is 7:9, we can set up a proportion to find out how many children can be fed with the remaining food. The proportion will be: (70 - A) adults / 70 adults = X children / 90 children Where X is the number of children that can be fed with the remaining food. We are given that X = 81 children.

First, rewrite the expression by adding and subtracting 6: [ 2x+frac{1}{x+3} = 2(x+3) - 6 + frac{1}{x+3} ] This can be further simplified to: [ = 2(x+3) + frac{1}{x+3} - 6 ] Now, we apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms 2(x+3) and frac{1}{x+3}: [ frac{2(x+3) + frac{1}{x+3}}{2} geq sqrt{2(x+3) cdot frac{1}{x+3}} ] Simplifying the left side gives us the original expression plus -6 divided by 2, and the right side simplifies to sqrt{2} because the (x+3) and frac{1}{x+3} terms cancel out. Multiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting 6 gives us: [ 2(x+3) + frac{1}{x+3} - 6 geq 2sqrt{2} - 6 ] Therefore, the minimum value of 2x+frac{1}{x+3} is 2sqrt{2}-6 when 2(x+3)=frac{1}{x+3}. Solving this equation for x gives x=-3+frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, which satisfies the condition x > -3. Thus, the minimum value of the given expression is boxed{2sqrt{2}-6}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"prompt":"A plane on a search mission flew east from an airport, turned, and flew west back to the airport. The plane cruised at 300 km/h when flying east, and 400 km/h when flying west. The plane was in the air for 7 hours. How far from the airport did the plane travel?","completion":"Let's denote the distance the plane traveled from the airport as (d) kilometers. When the plane flew east, it traveled at a speed of 300 km/h, and when it flew west, it traveled at a speed of 400 km/h. Let's denote the time it took to fly east as (t_1) hours and the time it took to fly west as (t_2) hours. The total time the plane was in the air is the sum of the time it took to fly east and the time it took to fly west, which is 7 hours. So we have: [ t_1 + t_2 = 7 ] We can also write two equations based on the distance traveled and the speeds in each direction: [ d = 300 cdot t_1 ] [ d = 400 cdot t_2 ] Since the distance (d) is the same for both trips, we can set the two equations equal to each other: [ 300 cdot t_1 = 400 cdot t_2 ] Now we can solve for one of the times using the other. Let's solve for (t_2) in terms of (t_1): [ t_2 = frac{300}{400} cdot t_1 ] [ t_2 = frac{3}{4} cdot t_1 ] Substitute (t_2) into the total time equation: [ t_1 + frac{3}{4} cdot t_1 = 7 ] [ frac{7}{4} cdot t_1 = 7 ] [ t_1 = frac{7}{frac{7}{4}} ] [ t_1 = 4 ] Now that we have (t_1), we can find (t_2): [ t_2 = frac{3}{4} cdot t_1 ] [ t_2 = frac{3}{4} cdot 4 ] [ t_2 = 3 ] Now we can find the distance (d) using the speed and time for either direction. Let's use the eastward trip: [ d = 300 cdot t_1 ] [ d = 300 cdot 4 ] [ d = 1200 ] So the plane traveled boxed{1200} kilometers from the airport."},{"prompt":"Given the proposition: There exists x in [1,2] such that x^2 + 2x a geq 0 is true, then the range of values for a","completion":"The range of a is a leq 8.

According to the problem, we have the following information: 1. Orlando gained 5 pounds. 2. Fernando gained 3 pounds less than half of what Jose gained, so F = (1/2)J - 3. 3. The total weight gain for the three family members is 20 pounds, so 5 + J + F = 20. Now we can substitute the expression for F into the total weight gain equation: 5 + J + ((1/2)J - 3) = 20 Combining like terms, we get: 5 + J + (1/2)J - 3 = 20 (3/2)J + 2 = 20 Subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the terms with J: (3/2)J = 18 Now, to solve for J, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (3/2), which is (2/3): J = 18 * (2/3) J = 12 So, Jose gained 12 pounds.

Firstly, we note that triangle ABD is a right triangle because it is inscribed in a circle with diameter AD and AB as one of its sides. This means that angle ABD = 90^circ. Given that angle BAD = 6^circ, we can deduce that angle ADB = 90^circ - 6^circ = 84^circ. Since AD is the diameter of the circle and is given to be 1, we can find the length of AB using the definition of the cosine function in a right triangle. Specifically, in triangle ABD, cos(angle BAD) = frac{AB}{AD}, which simplifies to cos(6^circ) = frac{AB}{1}. Therefore, we have: [AB = cos(6^circ)] Next, we focus on triangle ABX. Since angle BXC = 36^circ and BX = CX, triangle BXC is isosceles, and thus angle BCX = frac{180^circ - 36^circ}{2} = 72^circ. This means angle ABX = 180^circ - 72^circ - 90^circ = 18^circ. Consequently, angle AXB = 180^circ - 18^circ - 6^circ = 156^circ. Applying the Law of Sines to triangle ABX, we get: [frac{AB}{sin(angle AXB)} = frac{AX}{sin(angle ABX)}] Substituting the known values and solving for AX, we have: [frac{cos(6^circ)}{sin(156^circ)} = frac{AX}{sin(18^circ)}] Since sin(156^circ) = sin(180^circ - 156^circ) = sin(24^circ) and using the fact that sin(18^circ) = sin(18^circ), we can simplify the equation to: [AX = cos(6^circ) cdot frac{sin(18^circ)}{sin(24^circ)}] Recognizing that csc(18^circ) = frac{1}{sin(18^circ)} and sin(12^circ) = sin(12^circ), we can rewrite the expression for AX as: [AX = cos(6^circ)sin(12^circ)csc(18^circ)] Therefore, the length of AX is boxed{cos(6^circ)sin(12^circ)csc(18^circ)}."},{"prompt":"Paula has 20 candies to be given out to her six friends.

First, the dress is reduced by 35% during the discount sale. To find the discounted price, we subtract 35% of the original price from the original price. 35% of d is (35/100) * d = 0.35 * d.

Given that the center of the circle lies on the line y=-2x, we can write: b = -2a Since the line x+y-1=0 is tangent to the circle at point P(2,-1), this line is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Thus, the slope of the line connecting the center of the circle M(a,b) to the point of tangency P(2,-1) is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the tangent line. The tangent line x+y-1=0 has a slope of -1, so the slope between M and P is 1, which gives us: frac{b+1}{a-2}=1 Solving this equation alongside b = -2a, we find: b+1 = a-2 Rightarrow -2a+1 = a-2 Rightarrow a = 1 Substituting a=1 into b=-2a, we get: b = -2 times 1 = -2 Now, to find the radius r, we calculate the distance between M(1,-2) and P(2,-1): begin{align*} r &= sqrt{(1-2)^{2}+(-2+1)^{2}} &= sqrt{(-1)^{2}+(-1)^{2}} &= sqrt{1+1} &= sqrt{2} end{align*} Therefore, the equation of circle M is: boxed{(x-1)^{2}+(y+2)^{2}=2} **Solution for (Ⅱ):** To find the minimum distance |AB|, we first check the position of point A(3,0) relative to circle M: begin{align*} (3-1)^{2}+(0+2)^{2} &> 2 (2)^{2}+(2)^{2} &> 2 4+4 &> 2 8 &> 2 end{align*} Since 8 > 2, point A(3,0) lies outside circle M.

First Solution 1. We start by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2: [ 2(sin x + 2 cos 2x)(2 sin 2x - cos x) < 2 cdot 4.5 ] This simplifies to: [ 2(sin x + 2 cos 2x)(2 sin 2x - cos x) < 9 ] 2. Next, we utilize trigonometric identities to simplify the expression on the left-hand side: - Use the identity for double angle of sine: ( sin 2alpha = 2 sin alpha cos alpha ). - Use the identity ( cos 3x = cos x cos 2x - sin x sin 2x ). Using these identities, we get: [ 2(sin x + 2 cos 2x)(2 sin 2x - cos x) = 4 sin 4x - sin 2x - 4 cos 3x ] Thus, the inequality becomes: [ 4 sin 4x - sin 2x - 4 cos 3x < 9 ] 3. Now we bound the terms ( sin 4x, sin 2x, ) and ( cos 3x ), which all have maximum absolute values of 1: [ 4 sin 4x leq 4 quad (text{since} |sin 4x| leq 1) ] [ -sin 2x geq -1 quad (text{since} |sin 2x| leq 1) ] [ -4 cos 3x leq 4 quad (text{since} |cos 3x| leq 1) ] Thus, the left-hand side of our inequality is bounded by: [ 4 sin 4x - sin 2x - 4 cos 3x leq 4 + 1 + 4 = 9 ] 4. For the given inequality to hold strictly, we must ensure that the maximum value cannot be 9. This happens if one term reaches its maximum or minimum simultaneously: - If ( -sin 2x = 1 ) (i.e., ( sin 2x = -1 )), then ( sin 4x = 2 sin x cos x = 0 ). - If ( -cos 3x = 1 ) (i.e., ( cos 3x = -1 )), it is evident that they cannot all simultaneously equal their maximum possible values. Therefore, ( 4 sin 4x - sin 2x - 4 cos 3x ) cannot exactly equal 9, and thus: [ (sin x + 2 cos 2x)(2 sin 2x - cos x) < 4.5 ] 2. Second Solution 1. Utilize the fact that: [ |sin x| + |cos x| leq sqrt{2} ] Equality holds only if ( |sin x| = |cos x| = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ). Consequently: [ |sin 2x| + |cos 2x| leq sqrt{2} ] Equality cannot hold simultaneously in both places. We then consider the expression: [ |sin x + 2 cos 2x | + |2 sin 2x - cos x | ] 2. Using the inequalities derived above: [ | sin x | + 2 | cos 2x | leq | sin x | + 2 leq 3 ] [ | 2 sin 2x - cos x | leq 2 + | cos x | leq 3 ] Since simultaneous equality does not hold, their sum is strictly less than ( 3 sqrt{2} ). Thus, the left-hand side satisfies: [ |sin x + 2 cos 2x| + |2 sin 2x - cos x| < 3 sqrt{2} ] 3. By AM-GM inequality, this implies: [ (sin x + 2 cos 2x)(2 sin 2x - cos x) < left(frac{9}{2}right)^2 = 4.5 ] Thus, we have confirmed that: [ (sin x + 2 cos 2x)(2 sin 2x - cos x) < 4.5 ] Hence the inequality is proven. blacksquare \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"What quantity of water should be taken out to concentrate 24 liters of a certain percentage acidic liquid to 60% acidic liquid if 8 liters of water need to be removed?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to know the initial percentage of the acidic liquid.

This means they cut down ( 0.8x ) trees each per day. Since there are 2 brothers, the total number of trees cut down by the brothers each day is ( 2 times 0.8x = 1.6x ). For the 3 days with his brothers' help, they cut down ( 3 times 1.6x = 4.8x ) trees. The total number of trees cut down over the 5 days is the sum of the trees cut by James alone and the trees cut with his brothers' help, which is ( 2x + 4.8x = 6.8x ). We know that the total number of trees cut down is 196, so we can set up the equation: [ 6.8x = 196 ] To find ( x ), we divide both sides of the equation by 6.8: [ x = frac{196}{6.8} ] [ x = 28.8235294118 ] Since James can't cut down a fraction of a tree, we'll round to the nearest whole number.

Observe that both pentagons F_1 and F_2 are regular and similar because they are both formed by connecting all the vertices and diagonals, respectively. By symmetry and the properties of regular pentagons, these shapes are also similar. 2. To find the ratio of the areas of similar figures, we use the fact that the ratio of areas is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding side lengths (Theorem on ratio of areas of similar figures). Thus, to find the ratio of the areas, we first need to determine the ratio of the side lengths of pentagons F_1 (larger pentagon) and F_2 (smaller pentagon). 3. Let a be the length of a side of the larger pentagon F_1. 4. Consider triangle triangle MCN formed by vertices and diagonals inside the pentagon F_1. The angle subtended in this triangle is 108^circ, thus: [ angle MCN = 108^circ. ] 5. Using the Law of Cosines in triangle MCN, we compute MN: [ MN^2 = a^2 + a^2 - 2a^2 cos 108^circ ] Simplifying further, [ MN^2 = 2a^2 (1 - cos 108^circ). ] Since cos 108^circ = - cos 72^circ (by trigonometric identities), [ cos 108^circ = -cos(180^circ - 108^circ) = -cos 72^circ. ] Hence, [ MN^2 = 2a^2 (1 + cos 72^circ). ] 6. Next, we know from trigonometric values: [ cos 72^circ = frac{-1 + sqrt{5}}{4}. ] Plugging this value, [ MN = 2a cos 36^circ, ] because cos 36^circ = sqrt{frac{5+1}{8}} approximately. 7. Now, consider triangle triangle MCP, in which angle MCP = 108^circ and MC = CP by symmetry of the regular pentagon. Using the Law of Cosines again: [ a^2 = MP^2 + CP^2 - 2 cdot MP cdot CP cdot cos 108^circ, ] simplifying further, [ a = 2 MP cos 36^circ, ] or [ MP = frac{a}{2 cos 36^circ}. ] 8. Finally, for segment PQ which is formed by subtracting lengths MN and 2MP, [ PQ = MN - 2 times MP = 2a cos 36^circ - frac{a}{cos 36^circ}. ] Using trigonometric identity, [ PQ = frac{a(2 cos^2 36^circ - 1)}{cos 36^circ}, ] hence, [ PQ = frac{a cos 72^circ}{cos 36^circ}. ] 9. Thus the ratio of the side lengths of the internal smaller pentagon to the larger pentagon is: [ frac{cos 72^circ}{cos 36^circ}. ] 10.

This means the sequence of the last nonzero digits of factorial numbers does not repeat with a fixed period. 1. **Identify the Role of Trailing Zeros:** The factorial of (n), denoted (n!), is the product of all positive integers up to (n). The trailing zeros of (n!) depend on the factor of 10 in the number, and each factor of 10 is a result of multiplying a factor of 2 by a factor of 5. The number of trailing zeros in (n!) is given by the formula: [ text{Number of trailing zeros} = leftlfloor frac{n}{5} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{25} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{125} rightrfloor + cdots ] 2. **Consider the Last Nonzero Digits:** Since the trailing zeros only affect the end of the number, we need to consider the nonzero digits that appear before the final zeros. To find (d_n), we can truncate the trailing zeros of (n!), then consider the product of the remaining digits modulo 10. 3. **Computational Complexity:** Because the factorial function grows extremely fast, the exact value of (n!) becomes impractical to work with directly for large (n). We instead use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. We need to calculate (n!) modulo 10, excluding the trailing zeros, to identify (d_n). 4. **Behavior of (d_n) and Analysis:** Let's consider the effect of trailing zeros on (d_n). For instance: - (5!) calculates to (120) which has a last nonzero digit (2). - (10!) calculates to (3628800) which has a last nonzero digit (8). - (15!) calculates to (1307674368000) which has a last nonzero digit (6). By examining these intermediate steps, we can ascertain that (d_n) is influenced by the permutations and combinations of digit multiplicative patterns and reductions modulo 10 after accounting for non-trailing zero contributions. 5. **Prove Aperiodicity:** Assuming on the contrary that there exist (T) and (n_0) such that (d_{n+T} = d_n) for all (n geq n_0), we can examine specific (n). For illustration: Take (d_{25}) and (d_{30}). Here: - (25!) cut of trailing zeros in (15511210043330985984000000) result in a last digit (4). - (30!) ends in (265252859812191058636308480000000) having a last nonzero digit (8). If we consider the cyclic multiplicative residues of non-trailing zero:(5k factorial certainly breaking), specific accumulated carry contributes cancellations must differ, demonstrating non-periodicity in retention post large combinable offsets. In conclusion, given these observations and by extending such steps, we can verify the sequence of (d_n) does not fix a period with identical last digit value beyond large bounds aggregates, ensuring aperiodic sequence behavior.

Let (v = sqrt{p^2 - u^2}). - The distance from ((u,v)) to ((0,0)) is: [ sqrt{u^2 + v^2} = sqrt{left(frac{a}{2}right)^2 + left(sqrt{p^2 - left(frac{a}{2}right)^2}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{a^2}{4} + p^2 - frac{a^2}{4}} = p ] which is rational. - The distance from ((u,v)) to ((a,0)) is: [ sqrt{(u - a)^2 + v^2} = sqrt{left(frac{a}{2} - aright)^2 + left(sqrt{p^2 - left(frac{a}{2}right)^2}right)^2} = sqrt{left(-frac{a}{2}right)^2 + p^2 - left(frac{a}{2}right)^2} = p ] which is also rational. - Therefore, the point ((u,v)) cannot be removed by either punch, proving that two punches are not enough. 3. **Three punches are enough.** - Consider punches centered at ((0,0)), ((1,0)), and ((pi,0)). - Suppose there is a point ((u,v)) such that both (u^2 + v^2) and ((u-1)^2 + v^2) are rational. - Then: [ u^2 + v^2 - (u-1)^2 - v^2 = 2u - 1 ] is rational, implying (u) is rational. - Now consider the distance from ((u,v)) to ((pi,0)): [ (u-pi)^2 + v^2 ] If (u) is rational, then ((u-pi)^2 + v^2) cannot be rational because (pi) is transcendental (not algebraic). - Therefore, (u^2 + v^2) and ((u-pi)^2 + v^2) cannot both be rational, meaning the point ((u,v)) will be removed by at least one of the three punches.

However, the lack of parallelism contradicts the typical properties of a parallelogram, where opposite sides are parallel. This condition alone, without additional information, does not guarantee ABCD is a parallelogram, but the explanation provided suggests it does, which is misleading. The correct interpretation should be that this condition does not suffice to conclude ABCD is a parallelogram without further information. - **Option B**: Given AB=CD and AD=BC. This condition implies that opposite sides of quadrilateral ABCD are equal in length. According to the properties of parallelograms, if both pairs of opposite sides in a quadrilateral are equal, the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Therefore, this condition does lead to ABCD being a parallelogram. - **Option C**: Given AB=CD and angle B = angle D. This condition involves angles at vertices B and D being equal. However, equal angles at B and D do not necessarily imply that opposite sides are parallel or that the other pair of opposite sides are equal, which are requirements for a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram. Therefore, this condition cannot determine that ABCD is a parallelogram, which aligns with the provided solution. - **Option D**: Given angle BAC = angle ACD. This condition implies that AB parallel CD due to the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, which states that if a transversal intersects two lines such that a pair of alternate interior angles are equal, then the lines are parallel.

Each term in the polynomial is analyzed for its parity: 1. x^3: If x is odd, x^3 is odd; if x is even, x^3 is even. 2. a^2x^2: Regardless of whether a is odd or even, a^2 is always non-negative, and a^2x^2's parity depends on x^2. If x^2 is even, a^2x^2 is even; if x^2 is odd, a^2x^2 is odd. 3. a^2: This term does not depend on x but is even if a is even and odd if a is odd. 4. -1: This term is always odd. For the whole expression x^3 + a^2x^2 + a^2 - 1 to be even: - x^3, a^2x^2, and a^2 should have combined parities that compensate for the -1 term. This means the sum of the first three terms must be odd. Hence, x needs to be even for the expression to be divisible by 2. Step 2: Divisibility by 3 Next, considering divisibility by 3: We need x^3 + a^2x^2 + a^2 - 1 to be divisible by 3. We can directly substitute x = 3t or x = 3t - a^2, where t is an integer: 1. x = 3t: [ text{substituting } x = 3t implies (3t)^3 + a^2(3t)^2 + a^2 - 1 ] [ = 27t^3 + 9a^2t^2 + a^2 - 1 ] Each term except a^2-1 is clearly divisible by 3. Hence, if a^2 - 1 is also divisible by 3, the entire expression must be divisible by 3. 2. x = 3t - a^2: Without explicit expansions, (x = 3t - a^2) directly places the terms simplifying divisibility considerations. # Conclusion The integer values of x that ensure that the term aleft(x^3 + a^2x^2 + a^2 - 1right) is divisible by 6 for any integer a are: [ boxed{x = 3t text{ or } x = 3t - a^2} ] Thus, x = 3t and x = 3t - a^2 are the solutions."},{"prompt":"Given a polynomial [ P(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c, quad text{where } a, b, c in mathbb{Z}, ] one of whose roots is equal to the product of the other two, prove that the number (2P(1)) is divisible by the number (P(1) + P(1) 2(1 + P(0))).","completion":"We start by noting that (P(x)=x^3+ax^2+bx+c).

Firstly, since the length of the chord on the x-axis cut by circle C is 2sqrt{3}, and by applying the Pythagorean Theorem to the right triangle that has half this chord as one side and the center of the circle as the vertex opposite the right angle, we gain the following equation: (2t)^2= left(frac{2sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2 + t^2. Simplify and solve for t: 4t^2 = 3 + t^2, 3t^2 = 3, t^2 = 1, t = pm1. Since the circle C is tangent to the positive y-axis, we must have t > 0, so we discard t = -1. Therefore, t = 1, and the center of the circle is (2,t)=(2,1). The radius is r = |2t| = 2.

This is a result of the Varignon's Theorem, which states that the figure formed by connecting the midpoints of a quadrilateral is always a parallelogram. 2. **Shape of the Parallelogram:** In this problem, it is specified that the segments connecting the midpoints of opposite sides are equal in length. This indicates that the parallelogram formed is actually a rectangle. This is because: - A parallelogram with equal diagonals is a rectangle.

Given the original diagonals of the quadrilateral are (a) and (b), and they intersect at the midpoints forming right angles (90 degrees) due to the properties of a rectangle. 4. **Area of the Quadrilateral:** The intersection of the diagonals of the rectangle divides it into four right triangles. The area (A) of the quadrilateral (which consists of these four triangles) can be calculated as the sum of the areas of these triangles.

Each of the six rectangular faces has 4 edges, but since each edge is shared with the hexagonal base, we only count the vertical edges that are not part of the hexagon.

Starting with no planet cards and no hegemon cards, on each turn (starting at turn one), you take either a planet card or a hegemon card, whichever is worth more points given your current hand. Define a sequence ({a_{n}}) for all positive integers (n) by setting (a_{n}) to be 0 if on turn (n) you take a planet card and 1 if you take a hegemon card. What is the smallest value of (N) such that the sequence (a_{N}, a_{N+1}, ldots) is necessarily periodic (meaning that there is a positive integer (k) such that (a_{n+k}=a_{n}) for all (n geq N))?","completion":"1. **Understand the value of the cards:** - Each planet card is worth 2010 points. - Each hegemon card is worth ( 4 ) points per planet card held. 2. **Identify the decision-making process:** On every turn, you want to choose the card that gives you the maximum points: - If you have ( P ) planet cards and ( H ) hegemon cards, taking an additional planet card is worth ( 2010 + 4H ) points. - If you take an additional hegemon card, it is worth ( 4P ) points. To decide between taking a planet card or a hegemon card, compare ( 2010 + 4H ) and ( 4P ). 3. **Set up the inequality for decision making:** - You take a planet card if ( 2010 + 4H > 4P ). - Conversely, you take a hegemon card if ( 2010 + 4H le 4P ). This simplifies to: [ 2010 > 4P - 4H quad text{or} quad P - H < 502.5 ] Which means: [ P - H le 502 quad text{(since P and H are integers and rounding 502.5 down)} ] 4. **Determine when to switch from planets to hegemons:** - Initially, you start with no planet cards and no hegemon cards. - You will continue to take planet cards until the point where ( P - H = 503 ) since buying a planet card becomes less favorable once ( P - H > 503 ). 5. **Each step up to switching point:** - For ( n = 1 ) to ( n = 503 ), you will take planet cards: [ a_n = 0 quad text{for} quad 1 le n le 503 ] 6. **Switch to alternating after having 503 planets:** - On the 504th turn and beyond, you must alternate between buying hegemons and buying planets. - This happens because: [ text{On } n = 504, quad P = 503 quad text{and} quad H = 0. quad text{You will take a hegemon card.} ] [ text{On } n = 505, quad P = 503 quad text{and} quad H = 1. quad text{You will take a planet card.} ] - This results in a periodic sequence ( {a_n}_{n > 503} ) with a period of 2 (hegemons and planets alternating). # Conclusion: The smallest value of ( N ) such that the sequence ( a_N, a_{N+1}, ldots ) is necessarily periodic is: [ boxed{503} ]"},{"prompt":"The chord length cut by circle M on one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola dfrac{x^2}{a^2} dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0) is 6.

Therefore, f(7) = 0 because f(x) is odd. To find the solution set satisfying xf(x-5) geqslant 0, we analyze it in different intervals of x: ① For x > 5, we have xf(x-5) geqslant 0. Since x > 0, this implies f(x-5) geqslant 0. Given that f(x) is decreasing, f(x-5) geqslant f(7), which leads to 0 < x-5 leqslant 7.

So, we have the equation: ( 750 times C times 12 - 1400 times 12 = 1200 ) Now, let's solve for ( C ): ( 750C times 12 - 16800 = 1200 ) ( 750C times 12 = 16800 + 1200 ) ( 750C times 12 = 18000 ) ( 750C = frac{18000}{12} ) ( 750C = 1500 ) ( C = frac{1500}{750} ) ( C = 2 ) Therefore, the cost per square foot of John's former apartment was boxed{2} ."},{"prompt":"For each real value of p , find all real solutions of the equation sqrt{x^2 p}+2sqrt{x^21} = x .","completion":"1. **Initial Conditions and Substitution:** Given the equation: [ sqrt{x^2 - p} + 2sqrt{x^2 - 1} = x ] Note that for the square roots to be defined, we must have (x^2 geq p) and (x^2 geq 1).

Specifically, these are natural numbers that divide evenly into each of their non-zero digits. - For example, 10 is one such number because 10 is divisible by 1. - Similarly, 122 is another such number because 122 is divisible by 1 and by 2, where both 1 and 2 are non-zero digits. 2. We aim to find the longest sequence of consecutive natural numbers, where each number in the sequence satisfies the condition mentioned above. 3. Consider the numbers ( x ) and ( x + 10 ). If both ( x ) and ( x + 10 ) fulfill the given condition, then their non-zero ending digits should neither be 3, nor 6, nor 9. This is because: - If a number ends in 3, adding 10 makes it end in 3 again, which is not acceptable. - Similarly, the same holds true if the number ends in 6 or 9. - Hence, we need to exclude the numbers that end in 3, 6, or 9 to form a valid sequence. 4. This leads to the realization that the gaps between blocks of numbers will occur when these digits (3, 6, or 9) are encountered at the end of the numbers. 5. We now seek the longest sequence of numbers from 0 through 19. Let's enumerate the numbers that are NOT divisible by any of their non-zero digits: - Numbers such as 13, 16, 19 fail to meet the condition. 6.

We are given a triangle ABC and squares constructed on its sides outside the triangle. We need to reconstruct triangle ABC knowing the centers of the squares A_1, B_1, and C_1. Part (a) We will use two different methods to find the desired triangle. First Solution 1. Assume that the problem is already solved, and let A_1, B_1, C_1 be the centers of the squares. 2. Let D, E, F be the midpoints of the sides of triangle ABC. We will show that triangles C_1DE and DFB_1 are congruent. 3. Since DE is the midline of triangle ABC, DE = frac{AC}{2}. Similarly, FB_1 being the segment joining the center of the square to the midpoint of the opposite side also equals frac{AC}{2}, so DE = FB_1. 4. Similarly, DF = EC_1 as both segments are equal to frac{AB}{2}. 5. For the angles, we use that angle C_1ED and angle B_1FD both equal 90^circ + angle A due to the properties of the squares: [ begin{aligned} & angle C_1ED = 90^circ + angle BED = 90^circ + angle A, & angle B_1FD = 90^circ + angle CFD = 90^circ + angle A. end{aligned} ] 6. Therefore, angle C_1ED = angle B_1FD, and triangles C_1DE and DFB_1 are indeed congruent. 7. Consequently, C_1D = B_1D. 8. Now, denote angle FDB_1 = alpha and angle FDB_1 = beta. Then alpha + beta = 180^circ - angle DF B_1 = 90^circ - A. 9. Since angle EDC_1 = beta, we have: [ begin{aligned} angle B_1DC_1 &= alpha + beta + angle A &= left( 90^circ - A right) + angle A &= 90^circ. end{aligned} ] 10. We find that DB_1 and DC_1 are perpendicular and equal. 11. To reconstruct the triangle, we start by forming a right isosceles triangle on the segment B_1C_1, where D is the midpoint of side BC: - Erect a perpendicular bisector of B_1C_1 which gives the triangle C_1B_1D with D as the midpoint. - Similarly, repeat this process to find points E and F for the sides BA and AC. - Construct lines through point D parallel to EF, through E parallel to DF, and through F parallel to ED. 12. These lines will intersect at points A, B, and C forming the desired triangle ABC. # Second Solution 1. Connect point C_1 to A_1 and find point B in triangle ABC accordingly. 2. Rotate segment BB_1 around the midpoint D of side BC by 90^circ such that the point B_1 moves to C_1 and B moves to A_1. - This implies that after rotation, B_1 is moved to C_1, hence B will move to A_1. 3. By doing this geometric transformation, we are able to determine that segments A_1C_1 are perpendicular to BB_1 and equal. 4. Thus, connecting segments and verifying, we get the required triangle vertices. Now let's move to part (b). Part (b) Here, we have equilateral triangles constructed externally on each side. 1.

Draw arcs centered on A_1, B_1, and C_1 with relevant intersection points. - Each intersection holds 120^circ and situated within created points. 3. Demonstrate equal length equivalences per rotations yielding: [ AA_1 = BB_1 = CC_1. ] 4.

Calculate: [ 99999 div 41 = 2439 quad text{since} quad 99999 = 41 cdot 2439 ] 4. Hence, the fraction (frac{1}{41}) can be written in repeating decimal form as: [ frac{1}{41} = frac{2439}{99999} = 0.overline{02439} ] 5. Multiplying by 3 to get (frac{3}{41}): [ frac{3}{41} = 3 times 0.overline{02439} = 0.overline{073170731707317} ] 6. The repeating sequence for (frac{3}{41}) is \\"073170731707317\\". 7. To find the millionth digit after the decimal point, we first identify the length of the repeating sequence. The length of \\"073170731707317\\" is 15 digits. 8. We need to determine the position of the millionth digit within the repeating sequence: [ 1,000,000 mod 15 = 10 quad text{(as } 1,000,000 div 15 = 66,666 text{ remainder } 10text{)} ] 9. The 10th digit in the repeating sequence \\"073170731707317\\" is 7. # Conclusion: The millionth digit after the decimal point in the decimal expansion of (frac{3}{41}) is ( boxed{7} )."},{"prompt":"the sequence {a_n}, given that a_1=1, if a_na_{n1}=2(ngeqslant 2 and ninmathbb{N}^*), then a_n= ______, if frac{a_n}{a_{n1}}=2(ngeqslant 2 and ninmathbb{N}^*), then a_n= ______.","completion":"In the sequence {a_n}, given that a_n-a_{n-1}=2(ngeqslant 2 and ninmathbb{N}^*), We know that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.

Let's call the time after Car Y starts t (in hours). In that time, Car X, traveling at 35 mph, would have traveled 35t miles. In the same time, Car Y, traveling at 50 mph, would have traveled 50t miles. We want to find the time t when Car Y has traveled the same distance as Car X plus the 42 miles head start that Car X had.

These provide 2 independent data points, not 3, making the initial assertion that D is non-essential incorrect. 2. **Identifying the Circles Involved:** - The node F is the midpoint of AC. - F lies on the Thales circle k_1 centered at A with diameter AE. - A scaled version of k_1, called k_2, would place C on a circle centered at A and extended twice the radius of k_1.

Having found that only ( a = 4 ) renders ( 11a - 1 = 43 ), the digit ( a ) must be 4. Thus: [ overline{mathrm{aa}} = 44 ] and [ overline{mathrm{aa}} - 1 = 43 ] 5.

Without loss of generality, assume that all these numbers are non-negative. If any of these numbers were negative, we could simply change their signs to be positive without affecting the inequality in the left-hand side, while the right-hand side would only increase. 2. **Projection onto Axes**: Consider a polygonal line (broken line) ( A_0 A_1 A_2 ldots A_n ) such that the projections of the segments ( A_0 A_1, A_1 A_2, ldots, A_{n-1} A_n ) onto the ( x )-axis are ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) respectively, and the projections of these segments onto the ( y )-axis are ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ) respectively. Let each vertex ( A_i ) be located to the right and above the preceding vertex ( A_{i-1} ). 3. **Application of Pythagoras' Theorem**: By the Pythagorean theorem, the lengths of the segments are given by: [ A_0 A_1 = sqrt{a_1^2 + b_1^2}, quad A_1 A_2 = sqrt{a_2^2 + b_2^2}, ldots, A_{n-1} A_n = sqrt{a_n^2 + b_n^2} ] And the distance from ( A_0 ) to ( A_n ) is: [ A_0 A_n = sqrt{left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i right)^2 + left( sum_{i=1}^n b_i right)^2 } ] 4. **Inequality**: Summing the lengths of these segments, we get: [ sum_{i=1}^n sqrt{a_i^2 + b_i^2} geq sqrt{left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i right)^2 + left( sum_{i=1}^n b_i right)^2} ] This follows because the total straight-line distance ( A_0 A_n ) is less than or equal to the sum of the segment lengths ( A_0 A_1, A_1 A_2, ldots, A_{n-1} A_n ). 5. **Condition for Equality**: Equality holds if and only if all the ( a_i ) and ( b_i ) are proportional, i.e., [ frac{a_1}{b_1} = frac{a_2}{b_2} = ldots = frac{a_n}{b_n} ] In this case, the polygonal line ( A_0 A_1 A_2 ldots A_n ) becomes a straight line segment.

This is equivalent to saying that the base must be a regular polygon inscribed in a circle with its center coinciding with the foot of the pyramid.

For the line to form an acute angle with the x-axis, the slope must be positive. The slope of the line is given by ( -frac{a}{b} ).

However, since the weight of each crate is between 150 kg and 250 kg, and 162.5 kg is within this range, we can use the upper limit of 250 kg to maximize the weight. So, the maximum weight for the 8-crates group is 8 crates * 250 kg/crate = 2000 kg. For the 12-crates group, the maximum weight per crate to not exceed the total weight of 2100 kg would be 2100 kg / 12 crates = 175 kg per crate.

Thus, z = frac{-1}{1-i}. 3. **Simplifying z:** To simplify z, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is 1+i: z = frac{-1}{1-i} cdot frac{1+i}{1+i} = frac{-(1+i)}{(1-i)(1+i)} = -frac{1+i}{2} = -frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2}i. 4. **Finding overline{z}:** The conjugate of z, denoted as overline{z}, is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part of z. Therefore, overline{z} = -frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2}i. 5. **Determining the Quadrant of overline{z}:** The point corresponding to overline{z} on the complex plane is (-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{2}). Since the real part is negative and the imaginary part is positive, this point lies in the second quadrant. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{B}}."},{"prompt":"Let m, n in mathbb{R}.

Substituting y=0 into the equation of the line gives mx - 1 = 0, so x = frac{1}{m}. Thus, the x-coordinate of point A is frac{1}{m}. Similarly, the line l intersects the y-axis at point B, which means x=0. Substituting x=0 into the equation of the line gives ny - 1 = 0, so y = frac{1}{n}. Thus, the y-coordinate of point B is frac{1}{n}. The area of triangle AOB can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at the origin and points (frac{1}{m}, 0) and (0, frac{1}{n}), which is frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{m} times frac{1}{n} = frac{1}{2mn}. Given that the chord formed by the intersection of l with the circle x^2 + y^2 = 4 has a length of 2, and considering the geometry of the situation, the minimum area of triangle AOB occurs when the line l is a tangent to the circle, forming a right-angled triangle with the radius as one of its sides. This configuration minimizes the area of triangle AOB while still satisfying the condition of the chord length being 2.

This means that the volume of gasoline Mix C in the tank is (5/8)T. After adding 7 gallons of Mix A and 4 gallons of Mix B, the tank is filled to 23/30 of its capacity. This means that the volume of gasoline in the tank after adding Mix A and Mix B is (23/30)T. The volume of gasoline added (Mix A and Mix B) is the difference between the volume of gasoline in the tank after adding Mix A and Mix B and the initial volume of gasoline Mix C in the tank. So we have: (23/30)T - (5/8)T = 7 + 4 To solve for T, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 30 and 8 is 120. We convert the fractions to have the same denominator: (23/30)T becomes (23 * 4)/(30 * 4)T = 92/120T (5/8)T becomes (5 * 15)/(8 * 15)T = 75/120T Now we can write the equation with the common denominator: 92/120T - 75/120T = 11 Simplifying the left side of the equation: (92 - 75)/120T = 11 17/120T = 11 Now we solve for T: T = 11 * (120/17) T = 11 * 120 / 17 T = 1320 / 17 T = 77.6470588235 Since the capacity of the tank must be a whole number, we can round this to the nearest whole number if necessary.

After projecting onto e_n, we start again with e_1, and so on. 2. **Parallel Lines Case:** - If all the lines e_i are parallel, the statement is trivial. The projections of P will only cover a finite number of points. Therefore, we can assume at least two lines are not parallel. 3. **Projections as Transformations:** - Let pi_i denote the orthogonal projection onto line e_i. - Let P_j represent the image of P after j projections. - Consider the transformation defined by the sequence of projections: [ varphi := pi_1 circ pi_n circ cdots circ pi_3 circ pi_2 ] 4. **Analyzing varphi:** - The transformation varphi maps e_1 to itself. After applying all projections in a sequence, the transformation varphi induces a stretching by a factor lambda on e_1, where: [ |lambda| = left|cos angle(e_1, e_2)right| cdot left|cos angle(e_2, e_3)right| cdots left|cos angle(e_{n-1}, e_n)right| cdot left|cos angle(e_n, e_1)right| ] 5. **Contraction Analysis:** - Since there must be at least one pair of consecutive lines that are not parallel, it follows that 0 leq |lambda| < 1. - This implies varphi acts as a contraction on e_1, mapping any point on e_1 closer to a fixed point O in e_1. 6. **Limit Cycles and Projections:** - Let Q be any point on e_1, and -Q its reflection with respect to the fixed point O created by varphi. - For any point P_{nk + 1}, we have: [ P_{nk + 1} in [-P_1, P_1] ] for all k in mathbb{N}. 7. **Boundedness of Projections:** - Consequently, for any intermediate projection P_{nk + m} where m in {1, 2, ldots, n}: [ P_{nk + m} in I_m quad text{where} quad I_m = (pi_{m+1} circ cdots circ pi_2) left( [-P_1, P_1] right) ] 8. **Finite Intersection:** - Since P's projections are confined within the segments I_1, I_2, ldots, I_n, which are finite and bounded, - The union of these finite segments forms a bounded set. # Conclusion: Thus, the projections of point P form a bounded set of points.

Thus, we convert the equation to: [ 9n - 3 equiv 0 pmod{16} ] [ 9n equiv 3 pmod{16} ] To solve this, we look for the modular inverse of 9 pmod{16}.

If n > 1 is a power of 2, repeated applications of g on n eventually reach 1. Suppose n is an odd positive integer, where n > 1. Write n = 2k + 1, where k is a positive integer. Since n is odd, [g(n) = n^2 - 3 = (2k + 1)^2 - 3 = 4k^2 + 4k - 2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k - 1).] Since 2k^2 + 2k - 1 is always odd and greater than 1, g(n) can never be a power of 2 when n is odd and greater than 1.

Now, applying the Power of a Point theorem to segments MA and MB with respect to circle S through point C and the segments MP and MQ: [ C^2 = (MA + AC)(MB + BC) = MA cdot MB ] Given that M is the intersection of AB and PQ, we affirm: [ (MB + BC)^2 = (MB + BA) cdot MB ] 5. **Solving for MB**: Therefore, we simplify for MB: [ (MB + BC)^2 = (MB + AB) cdot MB ] Solving this equation, we find: [ MB = frac{BC^2}{AB - 2BC} ] This indicates that MB is a specific measure that depends on BC, AB, and constants, not on the specifics of the circle S'. Hence, MB and thus the point M is fixed relative to these measures. # Conclusion: Therefore, the position of point M does not depend on the choice of the circle S'.

They form a triangle since they are neither parallel nor concurrent. - By induction, if we add one more line ( d_{n+1} ) to a configuration where a triangle exists, either: - The new line intersects the existing triangle at three new points, leaving the existing triangle intact. - It intersects the existing triangle forming a combination of one triangle and one quadrilateral. - In any case, a triangle will always be present when there are at least 3 lines. 3. **Step 3: Coloring scenario with fewer colors (proof by contradiction for two colors):** - Assume we can color the points with 2 colors such that no two adjacent points on the same line segment (with no other intersection between them on that segment) share the same color. - Consider the triangle formed by ( d_1, d_2, ) and ( d_3 ) with vertices as intersection points of these lines. - Each side of the triangle must alternate colors. - But this would result in the three vertices not alternating correctly due to the cyclic nature.

Given that the last three terms form a geometric progression, we can set up the equation: [ (a+d)(a+30) = (a+2d)^2 ] Expanding both sides, we get: [ a^2 + (30+d)a + 30d = a^2 + 4ad + 4d^2 ] Rearranging the terms to solve for a, we find: [ a = frac{4d^2 - 30d}{30 - 3d} = frac{2d(2d-15)}{3(10-d)} ] For a to be a positive integer, the expression frac{d(2d-15)}{10-d} must be positive. To determine the values of d for which this is true, we analyze the sign of the expression by constructing a sign table: [ begin{array}{c|ccc|c} & d & 2d-15 & -d+10 & f(d) hline d<0 & - & - & + & + 0<d<frac{15}{2} & + & - & + & - frac{15}{2}<d<10 & + & + & + & + d>10 & + & + & - & - end{array} ] From the sign table, we see that for d > 0, the expression is positive when frac{15}{2} < d < 10. This gives us two possible integer values for d: 8 and 9. For d=8, we calculate a: [ a = frac{2 cdot 8 cdot (2 cdot 8 - 15)}{3(10-8)} = frac{16 cdot (-7)}{6} = frac{8}{3} ] Since a must be an integer and frac{8}{3} is not, we discard this solution. For d=9, we calculate a: [ a = frac{2 cdot 9 cdot (2 cdot 9 - 15)}{3(10-9)} = frac{18 cdot 3}{3} = 18 ] With a=18 and d=9, the sequence becomes 18, 27, 36, and 48 (since the fourth term is a+30=18+30=48).

However, there is a restriction that if he chooses pepperoni, he cannot have peppers. First, let's calculate the number of topping combinations without the restriction: Total combinations without restriction = Cheese options * Meat options * Vegetable options = 3 * 4 * V = 12V Now, let's consider the restriction. If Denmark chooses pepperoni, he has one less vegetable option (since he can't choose peppers). There are 3 cheese options and 1 specific meat option (pepperoni) in this case. Combinations with pepperoni and without peppers = Cheese options * 1 * (Vegetable options - 1) = 3 * 1 * (V - 1) = 3V - 3 Now, let's calculate the total combinations considering the restriction. We subtract the combinations with pepperoni and without peppers from the total combinations without restriction and then add back the combinations with pepperoni (since they were excluded when we subtracted): Total combinations with restriction = (Total combinations without restriction) - (Combinations with pepperoni and without peppers) + (Combinations with pepperoni) = 12V - (3V - 3) + 3 = 12V - 3V + 3 + 3 = 9V + 6 We know that the total number of topping combinations with the restriction is 57: 9V + 6 = 57 Now, let's solve for V: 9V = 57 - 6 9V = 51 V = 51 / 9 V = 5.67 Since the number of vegetable options must be a whole number, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 5.

Consequently, (angle MLK = varphi), and we have the relation (sin varphi = frac{MK}{ML}). 3. Let (S) be any point chosen on the line (l).

The line (A_1C_1) is perpendicular to the diagonal (B_1D_1) and the edge (DD_1), hence the plane (BB_1D_1D) is perpendicular to (A_1C_1), meaning it coincides with (alpha). 5. The plane (beta) passes through the line (CD_1), meaning (D_1) lies on the edge of the dihedral angle formed by (alpha) and (beta). Because (AC parallel A_1C_1), we infer that (CO perp alpha). 6.

Construct the plane (beta) to pass through (m) and the line (CD_1). Here, (m) becomes the edge of the resulting dihedral angle, and (angle OD_1C) becomes its plane angle.

Each person (i) knows (i+1), (i-1) (with wrap-around at 12 to 1), (i+6), and (i-6) (with wrap-around 1 to 12). So, person 1 knows persons 2, 12, 7, and 6. 1. **Adjacent pairs**: Having two neighbors each, a person can form an adjacent pair with two others. For instance, in one configuration person 1 pairs with person 2, and this choice sequentially reduces pairing options as each person pairs with their next closest neighbor who hasn’t yet been paired. But since there are 12 people, this rotation doesn't return evenly by the time you return to the starting point – person 12 would attempt to pair with persons 1 or 11, who in this scenario would already be paired up. Hence, not all configurations of adjacent pairs will work without breaking chains about halfway around the circle. 2. **Direct across pairs**: This involves pairing each person with the one directly opposite them. Here person 1 will pair with 7, 2 with 8, and so forth. This method straightforwardly results in 6 independent pairs with each pair definitely knowing each other. 3. **Combining Configurations**: Counting precisely how many workable configurations using only adjacent pairs is complex due to dependencies between early and late choices in pair formation. However, directly across seems viable without restriction. **Valid combinations**: - Across-the-circle pairings were stated clearly and uniformly possible with 1 valid way.

Prove that at any moment during the competition, there are two teams that have played the same number of matches by that moment.","completion":"1. **Assumption by Contradiction:** Assume that at some point during the championship, every team has played a different number of matches. 2. **Assigning Labels:** Let's assign each team a label which is equal to the number of matches they have played plus one. Therefore, if a given team has played ( k - 1 ) matches, it will be assigned the number ( k ). 3. **Range of Labels:** Since there are 30 teams, the labels will range from 1 to 30 (inclusive). Each team gets a unique label within this range as per our assumption that every team has played a different number of matches. 4. **Analyzing Labels:** Since there are exactly 30 teams, each team will thus have a unique label from 1 to 30. This means that one of these teams must be labeled 30, indicating that this team has played 29 matches by the time the consideration is made. 5. **Contradiction Identified:** A team with the label 1 means this team has played 0 matches, implying that there is a team which hasn't played any match at all. 6. **Impossibility:** It is impossible for these two extremes to coexist under the rules of the championship. Specifically: - If ( text{Team}_A ) has a label of 30 (played 29 matches), it must have played against every other team at least once. - Therefore, ( text{Team}_A ) must have already played against the team labeled as 1 (which hasn't played any matches yet).

To ensure that the graph of y = 2|x| - 4 intersects the curve of x^2 + λy^2 = 1 at exactly two distinct points, substitute y = 2x - 4 into the equation x^2 + λy^2 = 1, which simplifies to (1 + 4λ)x^2 - 16λx + (16λ - 4) = 0.

If one foot of wire mesh costs 30, then the number of feet she can buy is: 120,000 / 30 per foot = 4,000 feet Since Melany will not be able to fence 1000 feet of the field, we can assume she can fence less than that.

The total number of students accounted for so far is 2 + 8 + 3 = 13 students. This leaves 20 - 13 = 7 students who borrowed at least 3 books. The average number of books per student is 2, so the total number of books borrowed by the 20 students is 20 * 2 = 40 books. We have already accounted for 0 + 8 + 6 = 14 books.

Consider the perpendiculars from P_1 and P_2 dropped to side BC intersecting the circumcircle at points P_1' and P_2' respectively. 2.

Specifically, we draw edges for pairs ((a, b)) if ( |a - b| = 3 ) or ( |a - b| = 5 ).

Therefore, the total for these combined sums is: [ (2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) times 2 = 30 times 2 = 60. ] 3. **Find the value of the sum for each diagonal:** Since this combined sum involves the sum of all diagonals twice, divide by 3 to find the sum for each diagonal: [ frac{60}{3} = 20. ] So, the sum of the numbers on each diagonal must be (20). 4. **Calculate the center number in the diagram:** Subtract this sum from the total to get the center number: [ 30 - 20 = 10. ] Therefore, the number in the center of the diagram should be (10). 5. **Position the numbers in the circles ensuring diagonals sum up to 20:** Notice that (2) and (8) are placed on one diagonal and (4) and (6) on the other diagonal to satisfy the above condition.
