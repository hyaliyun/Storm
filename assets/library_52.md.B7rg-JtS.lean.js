We then construct six triangles, each having M as one vertex and one side of the hexagon as its base: triangle AMB, triangle BMC, triangle CMD, triangle DME, triangle EMF, and triangle FMA. 3. The sum of the internal angles around point M in these triangles must be 360^circ: [ angle AMB + angle BMC + angle CMD + angle DME + angle EMF + angle FMA = 360^circ ] Hence, at least one of these angles, say angle AMB, must be less than or equal to 60^circ because: [ frac{360^circ}{6} = 60^circ ] 4.

(1) Find out how much chemical raw materials one robot and one worker can carry per hour respectively. (2) Now, 3600kg of chemical raw materials need to be transported. If three robots are involved in the transportation, how many additional workers need to be arranged to complete the transportation within 2 hours at least?","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Finding the Capacity per Hour for One Robot and One Worker Let's denote the amount of chemical raw materials one worker can carry per hour as x kg. Therefore, a robot can carry (x + 420) kg per hour, given the information that a robot can carry 420 kg more than a worker. The problem states that the time it takes for a robot to carry 900 kg is the same as the time it takes for 10 workers to carry 600 kg. This can be translated into the equation: frac{900}{x + 420} = frac{600}{10x} Solving this equation for x, we proceed as follows: begin{align*} frac{900}{x + 420} &= frac{600}{10x} 900 cdot 10x &= 600 cdot (x + 420) 9000x &= 600x + 252000 9000x - 600x &= 252000 8400x &= 252000 x &= frac{252000}{8400} x &= 30 end{align*} Thus, one worker can carry 30 kg of chemical raw materials per hour. For a robot, this amount is x + 420 = 30 + 420 = 450 kg per hour. Therefore, the answer for part (1) is: - One robot can carry boxed{450text{ kg}} of chemical raw materials per hour. - One worker can carry boxed{30text{ kg}} of chemical raw materials per hour. Part 2: Calculating the Minimum Number of Additional Workers Needed Given that 3600 kg of chemical raw materials need to be transported within 2 hours and three robots are involved, let's denote the number of additional workers needed as m. The total capacity for three robots in 2 hours is 450 times 3 times 2 = 2700 kg. The remaining amount to be transported is 3600 - 2700 = 900 kg. The capacity of workers in 2 hours is 2 times 30m, and this needs to be at least 900 kg. Therefore, we have the inequality: 450 times 3 times 2 + 2 times 30m geqslant 3600 Simplifying this inequality: begin{align*} 2700 + 60m &geqslant 3600 60m &geqslant 900 m &geqslant 15 end{align*} Thus, the minimum number of additional workers needed is boxed{15}."},{"prompt":"Let n be a positive integer.

We aim to prove that this (a) falls into the category we are looking for. 2. **Supposition:** Assume for contradiction, there exists an integer (n geq 1) such that (a = p^{p-1}) has (n) divisors. 3. **Prime factorization of (n):** Let (n = p^{alpha} prod_{i} p_{i}^{beta_{i}}), where (p_i) are distinct prime numbers different from (p). The number of divisors of (a = p^{p-1}) is given by ((alpha + p) prod_{i} (beta_{i} + 1)). Therefore, we have the equality: [ n = (alpha + p) prod_{i} (beta_{i} + 1) ] This implies: [ p^{alpha} prod_{i} p_{i}^{beta_{i}} = (alpha + p) prod_{i} (beta_{i} + 1) ] 4. **Analysis of (alpha):** - If (alpha = 0), then (n = p prod_{i} (beta_{i} + 1)) which is divisible by (p) only because the right-hand side would have (p) as a factor. - Hence, (alpha geq 1). 5. **Functions (f_q) and (g_q):** Introducing functions: [ f_q: x mapsto frac{q^x}{x+1} quad text{and} quad g_q: x mapsto frac{q^x}{x+q} ] Rewriting our equation: [ g_p(alpha) prod_{i} f_{p_i}(beta_{i}) = 1 ] 6. **Properties of (f_q):** For any prime (q geq 2): [ frac{f_q(x+1)}{f_q(x)} = frac{q^{x+1}/(x+2)}{q^x/(x+1)} = q cdot frac{x+1}{x+2} = q left(1 - frac{1}{x+2}right) ] Since (q geq 2) and (x geq 1): [ q left(1 - frac{1}{x+2}right) geq 2 left(1 - frac{1}{3}right) = frac{4}{3} ] Hence, (f_q(x) geq 1) for all (x geq 1) with equality if and only if (q = 2) and (x = 1).

The profit of a flight route is defined as the product of the prosperity of the two cities it connects. Find the maximum possible sum of the profits of these 5050 flight routes.","completion":"1. **Graph Representation**: We start by representing the cities as vertices and the air routes as edges in a graph G. Each air route connects two different cities, and no two air routes connect the same pair of cities. 2. **Degrees and Benefits**: The \\"degree\\" of a vertex A_i (representing city A_i) is denoted as d(A_i), which is the number of air routes starting from city A_i. Let k be the number of vertices with a non-zero degree, and let the degree of vertex A_i be a_i for 1 leq i leq k. The number of edges (air routes) in the graph is n = 5050, so the sum of degrees of all vertices is: [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_k = 2n ] Additionally, each degree satisfies (1 leq a_i leq k-1) for (1 leq i leq k). 3. **Sum of Products Calculation**: To find the maximum possible benefit sum of these air routes, consider the contribution from each vertex. For vertex A_i, let the vertices connected to A_i be A_{j_1}, A_{j_2}, ldots, A_{j_{a_i}}. The degree of these vertices is: [ d(A_{j_1}) + d(A_{j_2}) + cdots + d(A_{j_{a_i}}) + d(A_{l_1}) + d(A_{l_{k-1-a_i}}) = 2n - a_i ] Where A_{l_1}, A_{l_2}, ldots, A_{l_{k-1-a_i}} are vertices not connected to A_i.

We need to evaluate the number of optimal and suboptimal operation sequences. First, let's define the problem more formally using mathematical induction and properties of permutations. Step 1: Define the Permutation and Its Properties - Consider a sequence written on the blackboard (1, 2, cdots, 2007). - An operation sequence consists of 22 operations. For (1 leq i leq 11), the (i^{th}) operation adds (a_i) to some number on the blackboard. For (12 leq i leq 22), the (i^{th}) operation subtracts (a_{i-11}) from some number on the blackboard. The goal is to devise these 22 operations such that the final permutation is either optimal (an even permutation) or suboptimal (an odd permutation). Step 2: Understand the Property (P) Each step in the sequence of operations ensures no two identical numbers appear on the blackboard. Such a sequence of operations has the property (P).

Consider the plane ( C_1XY ). This plane intersects the line ( DA ) at point ( Z ). 3. We will show that ( C_1XZY ) forms a parallelogram: - Lines ( C_1Y ) and ( ZX ) are in parallel planes, ( BB_1C_1C ) and ( AA_1D_1D ), and hence cannot intersect. - Additionally, as both lines ( C_1Y ) and ( ZX ) lie in the plane ( C_1XZY ), they must be parallel. - Similarly, lines ( YZ ) and ( C_1X ) are parallel. - Thus, ( C_1XZY ) forms a parallelogram. 4. Construct parallelogram ( BYTA ) where ( AT = BY = 3 ): - Since parallelogram ( BYTA ) is constructed, line segments ( YT ) and ( BA ), along with ( C_1D_1 ), are parallel and equal in length. - Also, line segments ( YZ ) and ( C_1X ) are parallel and equal. 5. Given that ( ZYT ) and ( XC_1D_1 ) are corresponding triangles within parallelograms, they are congruent. 6.

Our goal is to find pairs of positive integers ((x, y) geq 1) that satisfy this equation. 1. **Initial Observation**: - Both (x) and (y) must be expressible as powers of some common positive integer (a). Suppose (x = a^p) and (y = a^q) for integers (a, p, q > 0). 2. **Substitution and Simplification**: - Substituting (x = a^p) and (y = a^q) into the original equation: [ (a^p)^{(a^q)^2} = (a^q)^{a^p} ] This simplifies to: [ a^{p cdot a^{2q}} = a^{q cdot a^p} ] - Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: [ p cdot a^{2q} = q cdot a^p ] 3. **Case Analysis Based on ( p ) and ( q )**: - Assume (p neq q). We need to consider two cases: (p > q) and (p < q). 4. **Case I: ( p > q )**: - From the equation (p cdot a^{2q} = q cdot a^p), we know (a^{2q} < a^p). Therefore, (p > 2q). - Write (p) as (p = 2q + d) where (d > 0): [ (2q + d) cdot a^{2q} = q cdot a^{2q + d} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 2q + d = q cdot a^d ] or [ d = q(a^d - 2) ] 5. **Subcase Analysis for (d)**: - We use (2^d > 2 + d) when (d > 2). Verify values of (d): - If (d = 1): [ d = q(a^d - 2) Rightarrow 1 = q(a - 2) ] Hence (q = 1) and (a = 3). So: [ p = 2q + 1 = 3 rightarrow x = a^p = 3^3 = 27,quad y = a^q = 3^1 = 3 ] Therefore, ((27, 3)) is a solution. - If (d = 2): [ d = q(a^d - 2) Rightarrow 2 = q(a^2 - 2) ] Hence (q = 1) and (a = 2). So: [ p = 2q + 2 = 4 rightarrow x = a^p = 2^4 = 16,quad y = a^q = 2^1 = 2 ] Therefore, ((16, 2)) is a solution. 6. **Case II: ( p < q )**: - From the equation (p cdot a^{2q} = q cdot a^p), rewrite it: [ frac{q}{p} = a^{2q - p} ] Let (d = 2q - p > 0): [ frac{q}{p} = a^d ] This implies: [ d = 2a^d - 1 Rightarrow d < 2a^d ] Here, (2a^d > d + 1) for (d geq 1) and (a geq 2), ensuring no positive integer solutions for (p < q). 7. **Trivial Solution**: - If (a = 1), then both (x = 1) and (y = 1): [ 1^{1^2} = 1^1 Rightarrow (x, y) = (1, 1) ] # Conclusion: The integer solutions to the equation (x^{y^2} = y^x) where (x, y geq 1) are: [ boxed{(1, 1), (16, 2), (27, 3)} ]"},{"prompt":"f n is a natural number, the nth triangular number is T_{n}=1+2+cdots+n.

This reduces to proving that ( widehat{PRA} = widehat{PSC} ). 1. **Angle Bisector Property**: - By the angle bisector property, ( widehat{RPA} = widehat{SPC} ) because line ( (RS) ) is the bisector of ( widehat{APC} ). 2. **External Angle Theorem**: - Using the externally tangential angle, we know that ( widehat{PAR} = widehat{BCA} ) since ( PA ) is tangent to the circumcircle ( Gamma ) at ( A ). - Similarly, ( widehat{PCS} = widehat{BCA} ). 3. **Application of the Sum of Angles in a Triangle**: - Now, consider the triangle ( triangle PRA ): [ widehat{PRA} = 180^circ - widehat{PAR} - widehat{RPA} ] - Substituting the corresponding angle values, we get: [ widehat{PRA} = 180^circ - widehat{BCA} - widehat{SPC} ] 4. **Conclusion that ( widehat{PRA} = widehat{PSC} )**: - Given that ( widehat{SPC} = widehat{RPA} ) and ( widehat{BCA} = widehat{BCA} ): [ widehat{PRA} = 180^circ - widehat{BCA} - widehat{SPC} = widehat{PSC} ] 5. **Isosceles Conclusion**: - Since ( widehat{PRA} = widehat{PSC} ), it implies that ( 180^circ - widehat{PRA} = 180^circ - widehat{PSC} ), therefore ( widehat{ARS} = widehat{ASR} ).

Secondly, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. Since all multiples of 10 have 10 as a factor (and hence have 2 and 5 as factors), they cannot be prime numbers, because they have divisors other than 1 and themselves. Therefore, there are no positive integers between 100 and 10,000 that are both multiples of 10 and prime numbers larger than 10, because being a multiple of 10 automatically disqualifies a number from being prime (except for the number 2, which is the only even prime number, but it is not larger than 10 and not between 100 and 10,000).

Let's break down each method into detailed steps: **Method 1: Analyzing the Inequality** 1. Given the inequality 2^{x}-2^{y} < 3^{-x}-3^{-y}, we can rearrange it to form 2^{x}-3^{-x} < 2^{y}-3^{-y}. This rearrangement is based on the properties of exponential functions and aims to compare the expressions in a form that highlights their growth rates. 2. Define a function f(x) = 2^{x}-3^{-x}. The purpose of defining this function is to analyze the behavior of the expressions on both sides of the inequality in a unified manner. 3. Analyzing the function f(x), we find that it is monotonically increasing over the real numbers (mathbb{R}). This means that as x increases, f(x) also increases. This property is crucial for understanding the relationship between x and y. 4. Since f(x) < f(y) and f(x) is monotonically increasing, it logically follows that x < y. This step is derived from the monotonicity of f(x), where a smaller input leads to a smaller output. 5. Knowing that x < y, we can deduce that y-x > 0. This step is straightforward subtraction, indicating the positive difference between y and x. 6. Given that y-x > 0, it follows that y-x+1 > 1. This step adds 1 to both sides of the inequality, highlighting that the expression inside the logarithm is greater than 1. 7. Therefore, ln(y-x+1) > ln(1) = 0. This final step applies the logarithmic function to both sides of the inequality, utilizing the fact that ln(1) = 0 and the logarithm is an increasing function. **Method 2: Using Specific Values** 1. Let's choose specific values for x and y, such as x = -1 and y = 0, which satisfy the original inequality 2^{x}-2^{y} < 3^{-x}-3^{-y}. 2. Substituting these values into ln(y-x+1), we get ln(0 - (-1) + 1) = ln(2) > 0. This calculation directly shows that for these specific values, the expression inside the logarithm is greater than 1, leading to a positive result. 3. Similarly, substituting into ln|x-y|, we get ln|0 - (-1)| = ln(1) = 0. This shows that for these values, the logarithm of the absolute difference between x and y equals 0. 4. Based on the results from both methods, we can conclude that option A, ln(y-x+1) > 0, is the correct answer. The specific values used in Method 2 help to confirm this conclusion by eliminating the other options.

Define points: - Let A and B be points on a line segment AB. - Let A_1 and B_1 be points on another line segment A_1B_1. - M is the midpoint of AB, and M_1 is the midpoint of A_1B_1. 2. Construct appropriate auxiliary segments: - Draw the segment M_1A' parallel to AA_1 such that M_1A' = AA_1. - Draw the segment M_1B' parallel to BB_1 such that M_1B' = BB_1. - We now have two parallelograms: M_1A_1A'A and M_1B_1B'B. 3.

Part (a): Given the problem and the reference that it links to problem 30.13, (a) aims to show that a projective transformation P that maps the line at infinity to itself is an affine transformation. **Steps and proof:** 1. **Uniqueness and Relation with Point Transformations:** Consider that if a projective transformation P maps the line at infinity (denote it as l_{infty}) to itself. To prove P is affine, we need to show that it preserves parallelism and the ratio of segments on a line. 2. **Fundamental Definition Considerations:** A projective transformation can generally be written in homogeneous coordinates. Let's think of the plane as embedded in projective space where affine transformations are a subset that includes translation, rotation, scaling, and shear. 3. **Use Invariance of Line at Infinity:** Since P preserves the line at infinity, we know P translates l_{infty} to itself. In simpler terms, points at infinity (parallel directions) are mapped to points at infinity--this preservation means P indeed respects parallelism. 4. **Consequence and Conclusion:** Therefore, as P translates the line at infinity to itself, it indicates that P is affine due to the invariance of parallel line directions and straight-line preservation (point-line incidence). Hence, transformation P is indeed an affine transformation.

The transformation Q keeps line l_{0} invariant. 4. **Affine Mapping Characterization:** Since R = P circ Q^{-1} is affine transformation defined on plane alpha, particularly preserving line l by maintaining l_{infty} mappings, it implies linear ratios on line l are also maintained under P.

The perpendiculars erected from the centers of these faces intersect at a point O located a fixed distance, a tan frac{varphi}{2} from their respective bases. Here, a is the apothem (inradius) of the polyhedron T and varphi is the dihedral angle between the two faces. **Step 3**: The same logic follows for the perpendiculars drawn from the centers of all other faces of the polyhedron. Therefore, all such perpendiculars will intersect at a common point O. **Step 4**: This common point O becomes the center of a sphere such that all vertices of the polyhedron will lie on this sphere. Thus, proving the existence of a circumscribed sphere for the given polyhedron. Part (b) - Existence and Proof of the Inscribed Sphere: **Step 1**: From the first solution in part (a), it was deduced that the point O is equidistant from all the faces of the polyhedron (a distance of a tan frac{varphi}{2} from each face center, where a is the apothem, and varphi is the dihedral angle). **Step 2**: Hence, for this polyhedron, there exists an inscribed sphere with radius: r = a tan frac{varphi}{2} Since the sphere touches all the faces of the polyhedron, it's referred to as the inscribed sphere. Part (c) - Existence and Proof of the Semi-Inscribed Sphere (Touching All Edges): **Step 1**: Consider the segment OK in the diagram (where K is the midpoint of the common edge MN of the faces alpha and beta). **Step 2**: Given that OK perp MN, the length OK can be calculated as: OK = frac{a}{cos frac{varphi}{2}} where a is the apothem, and varphi is the dihedral angle between the faces. **Step 3**: Therefore, the point O remains equidistant from all edges of the polyhedron. **Step 4**: This implies that there exists a sphere centered at O which touches all edges of the polyhedron. The radius of this semi-inscribed sphere (touching all edges) is: rho = frac{a}{cos frac{varphi}{2}} Part (d) - Coincidence of Centers: **Conclusion**: From parts (a), (b), and (c), we observe that the points identified as the centers of the circumscribed sphere, inscribed sphere, and the semi-inscribed sphere are indeed identical.

In this case, we want to find lambda such that the distance between foci, 2c, is 8, so: 2c = 8 c = 4 c^2 = 4^2 = 16 Since c^2 = a^2 + b^2 and using the hyperbola equation where a^2 = 5lambda and b^2 = 3lambda, we have: 16 = 5lambda + 3lambda 16 = 8lambda lambda = 2 Therefore, the equation of the sought hyperbola is: boxed{frac{x^2}{10} - frac{y^2}{6} = 1}"},{"prompt":"Three concentric circles have radii 4, 5, and 6.

Let (A', B', C', D') be the midpoints of (overline{HE}, overline{EF}, overline{FG}, overline{GH}), respectively.

Considering points like g(-frac{1}{2}) = frac{1}{-frac{1}{2}} - 2(-frac{1}{2}) = -2 - 1 = -3 and g(frac{1}{2}) = frac{1}{frac{1}{2}} - 2(frac{1}{2}) = 2 - 1 = 1, we see that g(x) does not consistently decrease, indicating that f(x) = frac{1}{x} does not meet the condition. - For f(x)=-sqrt{x}, transforming this gives g(x) = -sqrt{x} - 2x. This function is comprised of y = -sqrt{x}, which decreases as x increases, and y = 2x, which increases. Their combination, g(x) = -sqrt{x} - 2x, therefore, results in a decreasing function in its domain, meeting the condition.

First, the ninth grade completed half of the task, which means they did frac{1}{2} of the total task. Then, the eighth grade completed frac{2}{3} of the remaining task. Since half of the task was already done by the ninth grade, the remaining task before the eighth grade started was frac{1}{2} of the total. Therefore, the eighth grade completed frac{1}{2} times frac{2}{3} = frac{1}{3} of the total task. Now, we know that the seventh grade planted a tree seedlings to complete the task. The fraction of the task completed by the ninth and eighth grades together is frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} = frac{3}{6} + frac{2}{6} = frac{5}{6}. This means the remaining task, which was completed by the seventh grade, is 1 - frac{5}{6} = frac{1}{6} of the total task. Since the seventh grade's contribution, a, represents frac{1}{6} of the total task, to find the total task, we calculate a divided by the fraction representing their contribution.

However, there are only 5 boys available, which implies they must share at least one mutual friend among the boys. 4. **Distribution of Remaining Friendships**: The other 3 girls must each know at most 2 boys.

The axis of symmetry for a quadratic function ax^2+bx+c is given by x = -frac{b}{2a}. In our function f(x), we have a = 1 and b = -a, thus: -frac{-a}{2 cdot 1} = frac{a}{2} = 2 This leads to a = 4. So, the value of a is boxed{4}. (2) Because the function f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 is decreasing on the interval [0,2] and increasing on the interval [2,3], its minimum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is x = 2: f_{text{min}} = f(2) = 2^2 - 4(2) + 3 = -1 Also, at the endpoints of the interval [0,3], we have f(0) = 3 and f(3) = 0^2 - 4(3) + 3 = 0.

Skirts (overskirt and petticoats): Each skirt uses a rectangle of velvet that measures 12 feet by 4 feet. Since there are two petticoats and one overskirt, we have three skirts in total. Area of velvet for one skirt = 12 feet * 4 feet = 48 square feet Total area of velvet for three skirts = 48 square feet * 3 = 144 square feet Cost of velvet per square foot = 3 Total cost for velvet = 144 square feet * 3/square foot = 432 2.

This means the digit sum of ( overline{cd} + 9 ) is ( c + d ), which is the same as the digit sum of ( overline{cd} ). 5. Therefore, ( m ) and ( m + 9 ) have the same digit sum, and ( m + 9 ) is also divisible by ( 11 ). Case 2: 6. Suppose ( m = overline{a b cdots c d} ), where ( d = 0 ) and ( c leqslant 7 ). 7.

Thus, the digit sum of ( overline{cd} + 29 ) is ( (c+2)+9 = 11 + c ), and the digit sum of ( overline{cd} ) is ( c ). 9. Therefore, the digit sum of ( m + 29 ) is ( 11 ) units more than the digit sum of ( m ), making ( m + 29 ) divisible by ( 11 ). Case 3: 10. Suppose ( m = overline{a b cdots c d} ), where ( c = 9 ). 11. Add a number less than 10 to ( m ) so that the last two digits are ( 00 ) (e.g., ( m' ) resulting from adding some ( n < 10 )). 12.

To verify: - For ( f(x) = 0 ): [ f(x + y + y cdot 0) = f(x + y) = 0 = 0 + 0 + x cdot 0 ] - For ( f(x) = x ): [ f(x + y + yx) = f(x + y + xy) = x + y + xy = x + y + x cdot y ] [ = x + (y + xy) = f(x) + f(y) + x f(y) ] Hence, both ( f(x) = 0 ) and ( f(x) = x ) satisfy the functional equation. 2. **Assuming ( f ) is Neither Constant nor Identity**: Assume ( f ) satisfies the equation but is not constant or the identity function. We denote the initial equation by ( left(x_0, y_0right) ) for ( x = x_0 ) and ( y = y_0 ). 3. **Key Substitution and Arguments**: - Substitute ( x = -1 ) in the functional equation to get: [ f(-1 + y(1 + f(-1))) = f(-1) ] Let ( 1 + f(-1) = c ). - If ( c neq 0 ), for any ( y ), ( cy - 1 ) achieves all real numbers, so ( f(z) = f(-1) ) for all ( z in mathbb{R} ), implying ( f ) is constant, which contradicts our assumption. - Therefore, ( 1 + f(-1) = 0 ) or ( f(-1) = -1 ). 4. **Assume ( exists alpha neq -1 ) such that ( f(alpha) = -1 )**: - Using the functional equation: [ f(alpha + y + y f(alpha)) = f(alpha) + f(y) + alpha f(y) ] Since ( f(alpha) = -1 ): [ f(alpha) = f(alpha) + f(y) + alpha f(y) implies 0 = f(y) (1 + alpha) ] Since ( alpha neq -1 ), it must be that ( f(y) = 0 ) for all ( y in mathbb{R} ), which is a contradiction assuming ( f ) is not constant. 5. **Key Deductions**: - Thus, ( f(x) = -1 ) if and only if ( x = -1 ). - From ((x, -1)) in the functional equation: [ f(x - 1 - f(x)) = f(x) - 1 - x ] - Assume there exists ( x_0 ) such that ( f(x_0) neq x_0 ), and define ( a = f(x_0) - x_0 neq 0 ). 6. **Further Implications**: - Setting ( x = x_0 ): [ f(-1 - a) = a - 1 ] 7. **Recurrent Analysis**: - Using recursive substitutions and given key values and function properties, such as: [ f(1) = 1, quad f(3) = 3, quad f(2y - 1) = 2 f(y-1) + 1 ] - Solving step-by-step for individual values and general properties.

Since the moduli are 1: [ |alpha| = 1 implies a^2 + b^2 = 1 ] [ |beta| = 1 implies c^2 + d^2 = 1 ] 2. Given the equation alpha + beta = -1, we obtain: [ (a + c) + (b + d)i = -1 + 0i ] Therefore: [ a + c = -1, quad b + d = 0 ] 3. Solving the system of equations: [ begin{cases} a^2 + b^2 = 1 c^2 + d^2 = 1 a + c = -1 b + d = 0 end{cases} ] 4. Substitute c = -1 - a and d = -b into the modulus equations: [ c^2 + d^2 = ( -1 - a )^2 + (-b)^2 = 1 implies (1 + a)^2 + b^2 = 1 ] 5.

Given |alpha| = |beta| = 1, we can write: [ alpha = cos theta + i sin theta, quad beta = cos varphi + i sin varphi ] 2.

Let's break down each component. 2. Consider the expressions for overline{AO'}, overline{AO}, and cos(angle O'AO): overline{AO'}^2 = frac{r^2}{sin^2 frac{alpha}{2}} = frac{(s-a)bc}{s}, where s is the semiperimeter, and a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. For the circumradius R, we know: AO = R And the angle: angle O'AO = frac{alpha}{2} - 90^circ + gamma = frac{gamma - beta}{2} So, putting these into our original distance equation: d^2 = R^2 + frac{(s-a)bc}{s} - 2R cdot frac{r}{sin frac{alpha}{2}} cos frac{gamma - beta}{2} 3. From Problem 695, it is known that: 2 frac{Rr}{sin frac{alpha}{2}} cos frac{gamma - beta}{2} = frac{bc}{2} left(1 + frac{s-a}{s}right) Substitute this result back into our equation: d^2 = R^2 + frac{(s-a)bc}{s} - left(frac{bc}{2} + frac{(s-a) bc}{2s}right) Simplify the terms by combining and simplifying: d^2 = R^2 + frac{(s-a)bc}{s} - frac{bc}{2} - frac{(s-a)bc}{2s} Combine the terms: d^2 = R^2 - frac{abc}{2s} Using the fact that frac{abc}{2s} = 2Rr: d^2 = R^2 - 2Rr 4.

This is because if the last number is (k) for some (1 < k < n), then the permutation will have numbers both less than (k) and greater than (k) preceding it, violating the given conditions. 3. **Recursive Relation Establishment**: - **Case 1**: If the last number is (n), then the first (n-1) numbers must form a permutation of ({1, 2, ldots, n-1}) that satisfies the same conditions. - **Case 2**: Similarly, if the last number is (1), the first (n-1) numbers must also satisfy the conditions for a permutation of ({2, 3, ldots, n}), which is equivalent to ({1, 2, ldots, n-1}). 4. **Formulate the recurrence relation**: - Let (a(n)) be the number of desired permutations for ({1, 2, ldots, n}). - From the above cases, we see that there are (a(n-1)) permutations ending with (n) and another (a(n-1)) permutations ending with (1). - Hence, (a(n) = 2a(n-1)). 5. **Determine the initial condition**: - For (n = 2), the set is ({1, 2}). - The permutations satisfying conditions are ((1, 2)) and ((2, 1)). - Therefore, (a(2) = 2). 6. **Solve the recurrence**: - Using the recurrence relation (a(n) = 2a(n-1)) and the initial condition (a(2) = 2), we can compute (a(n)) by iteratively expanding the relation: [ begin{align*} a(3) &= 2a(2) = 2 cdot 2 = 4, a(4) &= 2a(3) = 2 cdot 4 = 8, &,,,vdots a(n) &= 2a(n-1). end{align*} ] 7. **General formula for (a(n))**: - From the recursive computation, it becomes evident that (a(n) = 2^{n-1}), because each step in the recursion doubles the count from the previous step. 8. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the number of permutations of ({1, 2, 3, ldots, n}) that satisfy the given conditions is given by: [ boxed{2^{n-1}} ]"},{"prompt":"Jackson is making dinner.

If Jackson eats 1/4 of the salad and 1/5 of the pizza, and he consumes 330 calories, what is the ratio of the calories in the pepperoni to the calories in the crust?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total calories in the salad. The carrots have twice the calories of the lettuce, so they have 2 * 50 = 100 calories. The dressing has 210 calories. So, the total calories in the salad are 50 (lettuce) + 100 (carrots) + 210 (dressing) = 360 calories. If Jackson eats 1/4 of the salad, he consumes 1/4 * 360 = 90 calories from the salad. Now, let's calculate the total calories in the pizza before we can find out the calories from the pepperoni. We know the crust has 600 calories and the cheese has 400 calories. Let's denote the calories from the pepperoni as P. The total calories in the pizza are 600 (crust) + P (pepperoni) + 400 (cheese). If Jackson eats 1/5 of the pizza, he consumes 1/5 * (600 + P + 400) = 1/5 * (1000 + P) = 200 + 1/5 * P calories from the pizza. We know that Jackson consumes a total of 330 calories from 1/4 of the salad and 1/5 of the pizza. So, the calories from the pizza are 330 (total) - 90 (salad) = 240 calories. Now we have the equation: 200 + 1/5 * P = 240 Let's solve for P: 1/5 * P = 240 - 200 1/5 * P = 40 P = 40 * 5 P = 200 calories The calories from the pepperoni are 200. Now we can find the ratio of the calories in the pepperoni to the calories in the crust: P (pepperoni) : Crust = 200 : 600 To simplify the ratio, we divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which is 200 in this case: 200/200 : 600/200 = 1 : 3 The ratio of the calories in the pepperoni to the calories in the crust is boxed{1:3} ."},{"prompt":"Marvin and Tina were selling candy bars to help fund their class trip.

We are given two key pieces of information: 1. The slant height of the cone is 2. 2. The lateral area of the cone is 4 times the area of its base. From the first piece of information, we know the slant height l = 2. The formula for the lateral area of a cone is given by πrl, where r is the radius and l is the slant height. Given that the slant height l = 2, the lateral area can be expressed as: [πr cdot 2 = 2πr] The area of the base of the cone, which is a circle, is given by πr^2. According to the problem, the lateral area is 4 times the area of the base.

Each layer moving outward from the center includes: - Center hexagon: (1) position. - First ring: (6) positions. - Second ring: (12) positions. - Third ring: (6) positions. - Fourth ring: (1) position. Hence, the total number of distinct positions without considering rotations is: [ 1 + 6 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 26 ] 3. **Consider rotations**: - Figure (b) can be rotated in (3) distinct orientations (due to the symmetry of the hexagon, each rotation by (120^circ) degrees results in a different orientation).

Thus, the mathematical expectation of the number of ladies who never have to stand up is: [ boxed{1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + ldots + frac{1}{n}} ] Or, approximately: [ boxed{ln n + 0.577} ]"},{"prompt":"Let points Z_1, Z_2, ldots, Z_n, ldots on the complex plane correspond to complex numbers z_1, z_2, ldots, z_n, ldots respectively; (1) Let z=r(cosalpha + isinalpha), (r>0, alpha in mathbb{R}), prove by mathematical induction that z^n=r^n(cos nalpha + isin nalpha), n in mathbb{Z}^+ (2) Given z_{1}=left( frac {1+i}{1i}right)^{20}, and frac {z_{n+1}}{z_{n}}= frac {1}{2}(cosalpha + isinalpha) (alpha is a real constant), find the general formula for the sequence {z_n}; (3) Under the condition of (2), find L=| overrightarrow {Z_{1}Z_{2}}|+| overrightarrow {Z_{2}Z_{3}}|+ldots+| overrightarrow {Z_{n}Z_{n+1}}|+ldots．","completion":"Solution: (1) Proof: When n=1, the left side =r(costheta + isintheta), the right side =r(costheta + isintheta), left side equals right side, i.e., the equation holds for n=1; Assume the equation holds for n=k, i.e., left[r(costheta + isintheta)right]^k=r^k(cos ktheta + isin ktheta), then when n=k+1, left[r(costheta + isintheta)right]^{k+1}=left[r(costheta + isintheta)right]^k cdot r(costheta + isintheta) =r^k(cos ktheta + isin ktheta) cdot r(costheta + isintheta) =r^{k+1}left[(cos ktheta costheta - sin ktheta sintheta) + i(sin ktheta costheta + cos ktheta sintheta)right] =r^{k+1}left[cos(k+1)theta + isin(k+1)thetaright], i.e., the equation holds for n=k+1; Overall, for n in mathbb{N}^+, z^n=r^n(cos nalpha + isin nalpha); (2) z_{1}=left( frac {1+i}{1-i}right)^{20}=left( frac {2i}{-2i}right)^{10}=1, and frac {z_{n+1}}{z_{n}}= frac {1}{2}(cosalpha + isinalpha) (alpha is a real constant), thus, the sequence {z_n} is a geometric sequence with the first term Z_1=1 and common ratio q= frac {1}{2}(cosalpha + isinalpha), therefore, the general formula for the sequence is Z_n=Z_1 cdot q^{n-1}=left( frac {1}{2}right)^{n-1}left[cos(n-1)alpha + isin(n-1)alpharight]; (3) Under the condition of (2), overrightarrow {Z_{1}Z_{2}}=overrightarrow {OZ_{2}} - overrightarrow {OZ_{1}}=(frac {1}{2}cosalpha-1, frac {1}{2}sinalpha) Therefore, | overrightarrow {Z_{1}Z_{2}}|=frac {1}{2} sqrt {5-4cosalpha}. overrightarrow {Z_{n}Z_{n+1}}=left( frac {1}{2}right)^{n}left[cos nalpha - 2cos(n-1)alpha + i(sin nalpha - 2sin(n-1)alpha)right], | overrightarrow {Z_{n}Z_{n+1}}|=left( frac {1}{2}right)^{n} sqrt {left[cos nalpha - 2cos(n-1)alpharight]^2 + left[sin nalpha - 2sin(n-1)alpharight]^2}=left( frac {1}{2}right)^{n} sqrt {5-4cosalpha}.

Let ( a_i ) be the number of times ( frac{1}{3^i} ) is written on the board. 5. **Sum of numbers**: The sum of the numbers on the board is always the same, which is initially ( 100 ).

In one move, you are allowed to take 2 buns from one plate and place them on 2 neighboring plates (one bun on each neighboring plate). Can you achieve an equal number of buns on all plates regardless of the initial distribution? 1. **Coloring the Plates:** We color the plates alternately black and white so that each black plate is surrounded by two white plates and vice versa. Since there are 30 plates, we will have 15 black plates and 15 white plates. 2. **Counting Buns on Black Plates:** Consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of buns on the black plates. 3. **Analyzing the Moves:** Let’s analyze what happens during a single move: - When we take 2 buns from one plate, they are placed on two neighboring plates, changing the number of buns on those plates. - However, each move does not change whether the number of buns on black plates is even or odd. This is because we always transfer 2 buns, preserving the overall parity of black plates. 4. **Final State Requirements:** - In the desired final state, each plate must have exactly 2 buns, since ( frac{60}{30} = 2 ). - This means each black plate must have an even number of buns, specifically 2, in the final state. 5. **Initial State Consideration:** - If we start with an initial configuration where the total number of buns on the black plates is odd, we cannot achieve the desired final state with exactly 2 buns on each plate. This is because the parity of the number of buns on black plates would not match the requirement (it would need to be even). # Conclusion: Since the parity of the number of buns on black plates is preserved and the initial configuration can have an odd number of buns on black plates, it is not always possible to achieve an equal number of buns on all plates from any initial distribution.

To demonstrate this, let's initially provide an example (illustrated in Figure 1(a)) showing that this is indeed possible. 4. **Transforming Equation:** To generalize, we alternate the sign of every second row as shown by the pm in Figure 1(b). For our condition x + y + z equiv 0 pmod{5} (where (x), (y) and (z) are the numbers in the white triangles surrounding a grey triangle), this transformation results in the simplified condition ( x + y equiv z pmod{5} ). 5. **Modular Relation:** Modulo 5, each number in the figure essentially becomes the sum of the two directly below it.

To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 72.99376049916008 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 20.2760445831 m/s Now, we know that the train takes 6 seconds to cross the man. Since the train is 130 meters long, it covers 130 meters in 6 seconds. The relative speed of the train with respect to the man is the speed of the train plus the speed of the man (since they are moving in opposite directions). Let's denote the speed of the man as Vm (in m/s). Relative speed (Vr) = Speed of train (Vt) + Speed of man (Vm) Vr = Vt + Vm We know the relative speed (Vr) is the distance covered by the train divided by the time taken to cover that distance. Vr = Distance / Time Vr = 130 meters / 6 seconds Vr = 21.6666666667 m/s Now we can solve for the speed of the man (Vm): Vr = Vt + Vm 21.6666666667 m/s = 20.2760445831 m/s + Vm Vm = 21.6666666667 m/s - 20.2760445831 m/s Vm = 1.3906220836 m/s Finally, we convert the speed of the man back to kmph: Vm (in kmph) = Vm (in m/s) * (3600 s / 1000 m) Vm (in kmph) = 1.3906220836 m/s * (3600 s / 1000 m) Vm (in kmph) = 5.00623910096 kmph Therefore, the speed of the man is approximately boxed{5.006} kmph."},{"prompt":"f the straight line y=x+4 intersects the circle (x+a)^{2}+(ya)^{2}=4a (0 < aleqslant 4) at points A and B, what is the maximum length of chord AB?

(In other words, if you cut a piece from a paper polygon with a straight cut, its perimeter will decrease.)","completion":"To prove that the perimeter of each resulting part after cutting a polygon with a straight line is less than that of the original polygon, we follow these detailed steps: 1. **Initial Observation**: Consider a polygon (P) with a given perimeter. When it is cut by a straight line into two parts, let's denote them as (P_1) and (P_2). 2. **Analyzing the Cut**: The cut itself is a straight line segment which introduces up to two new edges (on (P_1) and (P_2)) that were not present in the original polygon. 3. **Perimeter Calculation**: Let's denote: - The length of the cutting line segment as (L), - The perimeter of the original polygon as (P_{text{orig}}), - The perimeters of the resulting polygons as (P_1) and (P_2). 4. **Effect of the Cut**: Upon cutting, the new edges (created by the cutting line) in (P_1) and (P_2) replace a portion of the boundary of the original polygon. 5. **Perimeter Comparison**: When the boundary part is replaced by a straight line segment, the triangles constituted by the two new vertices joining to another edge of the polygon will have smaller lengths compared to the sum of the original edges forming the polygonal boundary they replace. 6. **Triangle Inequality Application**: Using the triangle inequality principle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side. Here it implies: - The straight cut (L) replaces several original edges, and the total length of those edges is greater than (L). 7. **Inequality Formation**: Therefore, the total perimeter of parts (P_1) and (P_2) after the cut will be less than the perimeter of the original polygon: P_1 + P_2 < P_{text{orig}}. 8. **Conclusion**: Hence, the perimeters of (P_1) and (P_2) together will be less than the perimeter of the original polygon (P).

Last week, if David earned W dollars, he spent P% of W on recreation, which is (P/100) * W. This week, David earns 30% less than W, so he earns 70% of W, which is (70/100) * W. He spends 20% of this week's wages on recreation, which is (20/100) * (70/100) * W. According to the problem, the amount he spends on recreation this week is 69.99999999999999 percent (which we can round to 70% for simplicity) of the amount he spent last week. So we have: (20/100) * (70/100) * W = (70/100) * (P/100) * W We can cancel out W from both sides since it's a common factor and won't affect the percentage we're trying to find: (20/100) * (70/100) = (70/100) * (P/100) Now we simplify both sides: (20 * 70) / (100 * 100) = (70 * P) / (100 * 100) 1400 / 10000 = 70P / 10000 We can cancel out the 10000 from both sides: 14 / 100 = 70P / 100 Now we solve for P: 14 = 70P P = 14 / 70 P = 1 / 5 P = 0.2 So, P = 20%.

In how many ways can the 2n players be divided into (unordered) pairs?","completion":"To determine the number of ways to divide (2n) players into pairs, follow these steps: 1. **Arrange all players in a sequence**: First, arrange all (2n) players in a sequence. There are ( (2n)! ) ways to arrange ( 2n ) players. 2. **Forming pairs based on sequence**: From the arranged sequence, we form pairs by grouping the first two players, then the next two players, and so on. Specifically, we group the players such that player 1 is paired with player 2, player 3 with player 4, etc. 3. **Account for overcounting due to pairs**: Because we are interested in pairs (unordered pairs), each pair can be swapped without creating a new unique arrangement. Therefore, for each pair, there are (2!) ways to arrange the two players within the pair that are considered the same. Since there are (n) pairs in total, this overcounts each arrangement by a factor of ( (2!)^n ). 4. **Account for overcounting due to the order of pairs**: We can also rearrange the pairs in any order, which doesn't give us a new unique pairing arrangement. There are ( n! ) ways to rearrange ( n ) pairs, which further overcounts each unique arrangement. Given these points, the total number of unique ways to pair up ( 2n ) players can be calculated by dividing the total number of arrangements by the overcounting factors. Therefore, the number of ways to pair up ( 2n ) players is given by: [ frac{(2n)!}{n! cdot 2^n} ] 5. **Express the result as a product of odd numbers**: By analyzing the product's structure, we can rewrite it using a factorial manipulation. We know that for forming the pairs, we can derive that: [ text{Number of ways} = frac{(2n)!}{n! cdot 2^n} = 1 times 3 times 5 times cdots times (2n-1). ] This expression is known to be the product of the first ( n ) odd numbers, which simplifies our initial fraction representation. # Conclusion: Thus, the number of ways to divide ( 2n ) players into pairs is [ boxed{frac{(2n)!}{n!2^n} = 1 times 3 times 5 times cdots times (2n-1)}. ]"},{"prompt":"The profits of QRS company fluctuate with a set of rules: (a) rise between 4060% from March to April, (b) drop 1525% from April to May, (c) gain 4555% from May to June, (d) experience a loss of 515% from June to July, (e) climb 2535% from July to August, and (f) decline 37% from August to September.

Let's calculate the maximum increase step by step: 1. March to April: Maximum increase is 60%. However, we need to ensure that this does not exceed 100%, so the maximum increase is 60%. 2. April to May: The profits drop by 15% (minimum drop to maximize profit). To calculate the new profit, we take the increased profit from March to April and reduce it by 15%. If the profit after March to April is 160% (100% original + 60% increase), the profit after the drop would be 160% * (1 - 0.15) = 160% * 0.85 = 136%. 3. May to June: The profits gain 55% (maximum gain). The new profit would be 136% * (1 + 0.55) = 136% * 1.55 = 210.8%. However, this exceeds the 100% overall increase limit within a month. Therefore, we need to cap the increase at 100%. The profit after May to June would be 200% (double the original profit). 4. June to July: The profits experience a loss of 5% (minimum loss to maximize profit). The new profit would be 200% * (1 - 0.05) = 200% * 0.95 = 190%. 5. July to August: The profits climb 35% (maximum increase). The new profit would be 190% * (1 + 0.35) = 190% * 1.35 = 256.5%. Again, this exceeds the 100% overall increase limit within a month. Therefore, we cap the increase at 100%. The profit after July to August would be 200% (double the original profit). 6. August to September: The profits decline by 3% (minimum decline to maximize profit). The new profit would be 200% * (1 - 0.03) = 200% * 0.97 = 194%.

Speed in meters/second = (Speed in km/hour) * (1000 meters/1 km) * (1 hour/3600 seconds) Speed in meters/second = 60 * (1000/1) * (1/3600) Speed in meters/second = 60000/3600 Speed in meters/second = 16.67 m/s (approximately) The train takes 72 seconds to pass the bridge completely.

This is a classic application of the triangle inequality theorem and properties of triangles which states that the side opposite the larger angle is longer. **Given**: In triangle ABC, AC < BC. 2. **Construct an Auxiliary Point**: - Since AC < BC, we can locate a point A_1 on the segment BC such that A_1C = AC. Hence, A_1C = AC < BC implying point A_1 lies between B and C on BC. 3. **Equal Segments and Angles**: - Consider triangles triangle AAC and triangle AA_1C. - By construction, A_1C = AC. - Hence triangle CA_1A is an isosceles triangle with A_1C = AC, implying angle A_1AC = angle ACA_1. 4. **Angle Comparison**: - Since A_1 lies on BC and between B and C, lines BA_1 and AA_1 intersect at A, creating angles at A and B. It follows from the triangle inequality theorem and properties of triangle angles: - Hence angle BAC > angle BA_1C. - Since angle CA_1A = angle ACA_1, - Thus, angle BAC > angle BA_1C = angle BAC => angle BAC > angle AAC = angle ABC 5. **Conclusion:** - We have shown, using the point A_1, that when AC < BC, angle BAC must be greater than angle ABC. Hence, by definition against the largest side of the triangle lies the largest angle and vice versa. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"the polar coordinate system, the distance from the pole to the line rhocostheta=1 is ______.","completion":"Solution: The equation of the line is rhocostheta=1, which is equivalent to x=1.

Instead of addressing the problem as pairing players, we can think about it as distributing players into pairs and focus on how many different ways there are to do this both generally and with the specific condition. 3. Look at representing the problem combinatorially: - The total number of ways to choose 4 positions among the 10 for the Russian players is given by the binomial coefficient binom{10}{4}: [ binom{10}{4} = frac{10!}{4!(10-4)!} = frac{10!}{4! cdot 6!} ] - Simplifying the factorials, we find: [ binom{10}{4} = frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 210 ] 4. Now, we consider arranging the 4 Russian players into exactly 2 pairs out of the 5 available.

Let us divide two of these squares into 2 additional squares each (making 6 smaller squares), and the remaining two squares each into 2 more squares (total 4 smaller squares), giving us the total: 6 + 4 = 10 (see Figure above). 4. **Rationale for Five Unique Subdivisions**: - Now, determine how to subdivide these rectangles further into four smaller squares uniquely. - Each rectangle can be divided in 5 unique ways, as shown in Figure 2: ![2. figura](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c724ddcbcee82c45d4dcg-1.jpg?height=507&width=1282&top_left_y=1042&top_left_x=411) 5. **Symmetric Reflections**: - Reflect each unique subdivision around a central axis (diagonal symmetry). This produces distinct configurations. For instance, see Figures 3-7 for 5 subdivisions: ![3. figura](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c724ddcbcee82c45d4dcg-1.jpg?height=464&width=828&top_left_y=1714&top_left_x=629) ![4. figura](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c724ddcbcee82c45d4dcg-1.jpg?height=439&width=412&top_left_y=2274&top_left_x=846) ![5. figura](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c724ddcbcee82c45d4dcg-2.jpg?height=453&width=398&top_left_y=267&top_left_x=847) ![6. figura](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c724ddcbcee82c45d4dcg-2.jpg?height=487&width=854&top_left_y=838&top_left_x=619) ![7. figura](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c724ddcbcee82c45d4dcg-2.jpg?height=521&width=851&top_left_y=1447&top_left_x=623) 6. **Ensuring Uniqueness**: - Each symmetric reflection ensures none of the smaller squares have the same set of vertices in more than one subdivision. The sizes in each subdivided part are different, ruled by fractions like frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{5}, frac{1}{7}, frac{1}{7}, and frac{1}{8}. 7. **Combining Subdivisions**: - By considering further symmetric reflections about the central line (vertical axis), we generate the remaining subdivisions. 8. **Verification**: - Through analysis, verifying that in subdivisions 3, 6, and 7 by symmetric reflection on the vertical line gives us the remaining solutions: - ![8. figura](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c724ddcbcee82c45d4dcg-3.jpg?height=442&width=458&top_left_y=126&top_left_x=823) - ![9.f figura](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c724ddcbcee82c45d4dcg-3.jpg?height=547&width=1027&top_left_y=754&top_left_x=533) 9. **Additional Notes**: - Further suggestions for different subdivisions involve adjustments like moving smaller squares to the edges or considering images with different symmetric properties. # Conclusion: By utilizing symmetric reflections around central axes, we ensure no repetition of smaller squares across the different subdivisions over the required eight solutions. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Find the fraction which has the same ratio to a certain fraction that 3 / 7 has to 6 / 5.

Induction Hypothesis: Assume that any regular 2k-gon can be divided into rhombuses for some positive integer k. Induction Step: 1. Consider a regular 2(k+1)-gon. 2. Observe the internal structure of a regular 2(k+1)-gon. If we add a vertex to a regular 2k-gon to form a 2(k+1)-gon, we can use the previous 2k-gon configuration. 3. Divide the 2(k+1)-gon into two parts: one part being a regular 2k-gon and the other part containing 2 additional triangles adjacent to the 2k-gon vertices. 4. Each of the triangular sections can be further divided into smaller rhombuses. The meeting point of these triangular sections and the larger 2k-gon can be shared, ensuring all internal angles remained consistent and covered by rhombus shapes. Specifically, focus on the triangular parts: - Each triangle adjacent to the (k+1)th added point can be viewed as being constructed from two rhombuses. - By symmetry and angle preservation, these rhombuses align with the existing 2k-gon's rhombuses, forming a complete tiling of the 2(k+1)-gon.

However, observe the middle number in this scenario, 6.5, is not in the list. Each integer pair that can sum to 13 contains distinct integers. Thus, similar to the initial description, removing any integer always results in a decrease of exactly one valid summing pair. Given this equality in reduction across all potential removals, unlike the example given, removing any number here does not bring an advantage over any other in terms of pairs summing to 13. This is because there is a symmetry with each number having a unique pair that sums to 13, causing equal impact by their removal. Given this, removing any single number from this list does not give a distinct advantage for maximizing pairs that sum to 13. Therefore, since any removal has an equal impact, we arbitrarily pick a number to remove, such as 0. Removing any number is as good as any other due to equality in the counts of remaining sum pairs.

For x leq -3, both x-1 and x+3 are negative, so f(x) = -(x-1)-(x+3) = -2x-2. 2. For -3 < x < 1, x+3 is positive and x-1 is negative, so f(x) = -(x-1)+(x+3) = 4. 3. For x geq 1, both x-1 and x+3 are positive, so f(x) = (x-1)+(x+3) = 2x+2. Now, solving the inequality f(x) geqslant 6 in each interval: - For x leq -3, we have -2x-2 geqslant 6, which simplifies to -2x geqslant 8, and further to x leq -4. - For -3 < x < 1, the inequality 4 geqslant 6 does not hold, so there are no solutions in this interval. - For x geq 1, we have 2x+2 geqslant 6, simplifying to 2x geqslant 4, and further to x geq 2.

By the triangle inequality, we have: f(x) geqslant |x-a-x-3| = |a+3| Given f(x) > -a, we substitute the lower bound of f(x) to get: |a+3| > -a 1. When a geq 0, the inequality |a+3| > -a always holds because the absolute value is always non-negative, and -a is non-positive. 2. When a < 0, we need to ensure that the inequality holds, which translates to a+3 > -a and -(a+3) > -a. Solving a+3 > -a gives 2a > -3, or a > -frac{3}{2}. The second part of the inequality -(a+3) > -a simplifies to 3 > 0, which is always true.

(Note: 6 and 9 cannot be interpreted interchangeably.) 1. **Understand the combination sums for three-digit numbers:** - If three cards (a), (b), and (c) (without 0) are chosen: [ text{Three-digit numbers formed} = 222(a + b + c) ] - This is because for every possible permutation, each digit appears in each place (hundreds, tens, units) twice. - If one of these three cards is 0: [ text{Three-digit numbers formed} = 4 left[(100a + 10b + c) + (100a + 10c + b) + (100b + 10a + c) + (100b + 10c + a) + (100c + 10a + b) + (100c + 10b + a)right] = 211(a + b) ] 2. **Determine the nature of the sums:** - For a sum to be a multiple of 222 (as in the case without '0'), it must meet the requirement 555(a+b+c) where each digit contributes equally in all places. - For a sum to be a multiple of 211 (as in the case with '0'), it must have the structure 211(a+b) where only two digits contribute equally without '0' affecting much. 3. **Analyze given sums:** - (1554) is checked: [ 1554 div 222 = 7 ] - Sum of the digits in A's cards is (7). This implies A's cards do not include '0'. - (1688) is checked: [ 1688 div 211 = 8 ] - Sum of the digits in B's cards is (8). This implies B's cards include '0'. - (4662) is checked: [ 4662 div 222 = 21 ] - Sum of the digits in C's cards is (21). This implies C's cards do not include '0'. 4. **Total sum of cards and subtraction:** - Cards cover all digits from 0 to 9, whose combined sum is evaluated: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 ] 5. **Card calculations:** - A's sum contribution: [ = 7 ] - B's sum contribution: [ = 8 ] - C's sum contribution: [ = 21 ] - Remaining card is evaluated: [ 45 - 7 - 8 - 21 = 9 ] 6. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{9} ]"},{"prompt":"Petya created all the numbers that can be made from the digits 2, 0, 1, 8 (each digit can be used no more than once).

Therefore, each of the digits 1, 2, and 8 will appear (1 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 11) times in the units place. - **Tens place:** Each of the digits 1, 2, and 8 will appear: - 3 times in the two-digit numbers - 4 times in the three-digit numbers - 4 times in the four-digit numbers. Therefore, each of the digits 1, 2, and 8 will appear (3 + 4 + 4 = 11) times in the tens place. - **Hundreds place:** Each of the digits 1, 2, and 8 will appear: - 6 times in the three-digit numbers - 4 times in the four-digit numbers. Therefore, each of the digits 1, 2, and 8 will appear (6 + 4 = 10) times in the hundreds place. - **Thousands place:** Each of the digits 1, 2, and 8 will appear: - 6 times in the four-digit numbers.

Each of the digits 1, 2, and 8 appears 11 times in the units place, 11 times in the tens place, 10 times in the hundreds place, and 6 times in the thousands place. 2. **Calculate the contribution of each digit to the total sum:** Since we established the occurrences of each digit in each place value, we will sum the contributions from each digit in each place value: - **For the digit 1:** - Units place: (1 times 11 times 1 = 11) - Tens place: (1 times 11 times 10 = 110) - Hundreds place: (1 times 10 times 100 = 1000) - Thousands place: (1 times 6 times 1000 = 6000) - **For the digit 2:** - Units place: (2 times 11 times 1 = 22) - Tens place: (2 times 11 times 10 = 220) - Hundreds place: (2 times 10 times 100 = 2000) - Thousands place: (2 times 6 times 1000 = 12000) - **For the digit 8:** - Units place: (8 times 11 times 1 = 88) - Tens place: (8 times 11 times 10 = 880) - Hundreds place: (8 times 10 times 100 = 8000) - Thousands place: (8 times 6 times 1000 = 48000) 3. **Sum all contributions to get the total sum:** tiny{ begin{align*} text{Total Sum} & = (11 + 110 + 1000 + 6000) + (22 + 220 + 2000 + 12000) + (88 + 880 + 8000 + 48000) & = 7111 + 14242 + 56968 & = 78311 end{align*} tiny} Conclusion: [ boxed{78331} ]"},{"prompt":"Let g(n) return the number of distinct ordered pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that for each ordered pair, a^2 + b^2 = n.

Since OK = OD, J is the midpoint of KD, and OJ parallel CD. 5. **Angle relationships:** We have angle BCD = angle BOJ = angle BOK + angle KOJ = 2angle BEK + frac{1}{2} angle KOD = 2angle BEK + angle DEK. 6. **Claim and proof:** We claim that angle OEK = 2angle BEK. To prove this, let F be a point on AB such that angle FEK = 2angle BEK. We need to show that F equiv O. 7. **Concyclic points:** From the previous step, we have angle FCD = angle BCD = angle FEK + angle DEK = angle FED. Therefore, points F, C, E, D are concyclic. This implies angle FED = angle FCD = angle ACE = angle FDE, and hence FE = FD. 8. **Reflections and circle intersection:** Let E' and D' be the reflections of E and D over AB. Then E' and D' lie on omega_1, and FE = FE' = FD = FD'. Draw a circle omega_3 with center F and radius FE. The circle omega_3 intersects omega_1 at E, E', D, D'. Since a circle can intersect another circle in at most two points, we conclude that omega_3 equiv omega_1, implying F equiv O. 9. **Final angle relationships:** Therefore, angle OEK = 2angle BEK implies angle OEB = angle BEK. Since OE = OB, we have angle OEB = angle OBE, and thus angle OBE = angle BEK. This implies that KE parallel AB. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given two sequences of numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, …, 2001 and 6, 11, 16, …, 2001, the number of integers that appear in both sequences is ( ) A: 199 B: 200 C: 201 D: 202","completion":"**Analysis:** According to the first sequence, which starts from 1 and has a difference of 2 between each pair of adjacent numbers, and the second sequence, which starts from 6 and has a difference of 5 between each pair of adjacent numbers, the numbers that appear in both sequences should start from 1 and have a difference of 10, i.e., 11, 21, 31, 41, …, 1991, 2001, totaling 20 times 10 + 1 = 201 numbers.

Since the original graph of y = ax passes through the origin (0, 0), the translated graph will pass through (0+1, 0) = (1, 0), but then this point (1, 0) is further modified in the second step. 2. After translating the graph to the right by 1 unit, you then scale the y-coordinates by a factor of 2 to obtain the graph of y = 2ax - 1. So, every point (x, y) on the graph of y = ax - 1 will be transformed to (x, 2y) on the graph of y = 2ax - 1. Combining these two transformations, the origin (0, 0) from the graph of y = ax is first moved to (1, 0) and then scaled to (1, 0 times 2) = (1, 0). To find the point that moves to (1, 2) after the transformation, we need to reverse the scaling and translation. Starting from (1, 2), we first divide the y-coordinate by 2, giving us (1, 1). Then we shift left by one unit to account for the translation, which brings us to the point (0, 1). However, the statement in the original solution that \\"the graph of y = ax where 0 < a < 1 passes through the point (0, 1)\\" is incorrect as the graph of y = ax for 0 < a < 1 should pass through the origin (0, 0) and no other y-intercept. Since the graph of y = ax for 0 < a < 1 only intersects the y-axis at the origin, none of the transformations applied can result in a graph that passes through the point (0, 1). Instead, the given transformation process only scales and translates points along the graph. To determine the correct point through which the graph passes, we set x = 1 in the equation y = 2ax - 1 and consider the definition of a which is 0 Plugging x = 1 into the function, we get y = 2a cdot 1 - 1, which simplifies to y = 2a - 1. Since 0 < a < 1, the value of y when x=1 must satisfy -1 < y < 1, meaning the graph must pass through the point where -1 < y < 1 when x = 1. Therefore, the correct point is boxed{text{B: }(1, 2)}, as when a = 1, y = 2 cdot 1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1, which is within the specified range for y when x = 1."},{"prompt":"the triangle ( triangle ABC ) shown in the diagram, point ( D ) is an interior point, and ( x, y, z, w ) are the degrees of the angles shown.

To do this, the mathematician can ask any scientist the question: Is suchandsuch person a chemist or an alchemist? (In particular, the mathematician can ask a scientist about themselves.) Prove that the mathematician can determine this with 2 k 3 questions.","completion":"Given: - ( k ) is the total number of scientists at the conference, consisting of chemists and alchemists. - Chemists always tell the truth. - Alchemists sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie. - Chemists are in the majority compared to alchemists. The mathematician aims to determine whether each scientist is a chemist or an alchemist by asking questions. To show that the mathematician can determine the identity of each scientist with at most ( 2k - 3 ) questions, we follow these steps: 1. **Initial Questioning Strategy**: - The mathematician starts by questioning any scientist, say ( S_1 ), about another scientist, say ( S_2 ). - The mathematician asks ( S_1 ), \\"Is ( S_2 ) a chemist?\\" - Since chemists always tell the truth, the mathematician needs confirmation to believe ( S_1 )'s answer. Therefore, they need to cross-check this information. 2. **Cross-checking**: - Ask ( S_2 ) about another scientist, say ( S_3 ). - \\"Is ( S_3 ) a chemist?\\" - Cross-confirm by asking another scientist, say ( S_4 ), the same question about ( S_3 ). 3. **Pattern Recognition**: - By strategically asking ( 2(k-1) ) questions like this for ( k-1 ) pairings, the mathematician can get a consistent pattern (truth or lie) about one specific scientist. - This ensures enough cross-verified data points that align or contrast to identify consistency. 4. **Final Step for Verification**: - Once a pattern is recognized (truth-tellers as chemists), 1 more question for any remaining ambiguity can conclusively prove or disprove the chemist's majority. 5. **Conclusion**: - Since there are ( k ) scientists, and the questioning pattern is optimal, the total number of reliable questions to identify each scientist is ( 2k - 3 ).

Jerry also informed Tom that in any 6 times 6 square there are at least 2 pieces with fish, and in any 3 times 3 square there is at most one piece with sausage. What is the minimum number of pieces Tom needs to eat to ensure he gets a piece that contains both fish and sausage?","completion":"1. Define the piece that contains both fish and sausage as the \\"desired piece.\\" 2. According to the problem statement, in any 6 times 6 square of the 8 times 8 pie, there are at least 2 pieces containing fish (\\"R\\"). Each such square must contain at least one known fish piece. 3. To narrow down our search, let's examine the grid, focusing on potential 4 times 6 (gray rectangle in the diagram) that covers all areas where known fish pieces reside. These areas are where each 6 times 6 square contains at most one unknown piece of fish. 4. Now, consider the condition concerning sausage (\\"K\\") pieces: in any 3 times 3 square, there can be at most one piece with sausage. All these 3 times 3 squares will cover up regions where known sausage pieces are located. 5. From our known sausage and fish placements, the critical finding is that all these constraints reduce the number of potential unknown pieces that contain both fish and sausage. 6. Calculate the exact coverage of these 3 times 3 and 6 times 6 constraints, focusing on the overlapping regions. Notably, any overlapping 3 times 3 and 6 times 6 covered regions exclude the possibility of these containing the unknown piece. 7. This leaves exactly five grey-marked cells (excluding areas covered by hash marks in the diagram) which are not constrained by the above rules: - Specifically, let's check and mark each suspicious cell excluded from both predominant regions. 8. To make sure Tom guarantees eating a piece with both fish and sausage, he needs to consume all five remaining constraint-free and suspicious cells. Thus, the minimum number of pieces Tom needs to eat to ensure he gets the desired piece with both fish and sausage is five. # Conclusion: [ boxed{5} ]"},{"prompt":"the language of the Tekimar tribe, there are only 7 letters: A, E, I, K, M, R, T, but the alphabetical order of these letters is unknown.

This method involves assuming the opposite of what we want to prove and then demonstrating that this assumption leads to a contradiction. Let's begin by stating the proposition clearly: \\"If a and b are natural numbers and their product ab is divisible by 5, then at least one of a or b must be divisible by 5.\\" Now, we make our counter assumption (the opposite of what we want to prove): - Assume that neither a nor b is divisible by 5. Given our assumption, a and b can be represented as follows: - a = 5k_1 + r_1, where 0 < r_1 < 5, - b = 5k_2 + r_2, where 0 < r_2 < 5. Here, k_1 and k_2 are integers, and r_1 and r_2 are the remainders when a and b, respectively, are divided by 5. Now, we consider the product ab: ab = (5k_1 + r_1)(5k_2 + r_2) = 25k_1k_2 + 5k_1r_2 + 5k_2r_1 + r_1r_2. This can be further simplified: ab = 5(5k_1k_2 + k_1r_2 + k_2r_1) + r_1r_2. Since r_1 and r_2 are both less than 5 and greater than 0, their product r_1r_2 is also less than 25 and not divisible by 5. Looking at the expression for ab, we see it consists of a term that is a multiple of 5 plus the term r_1r_2. Since we already established that r_1r_2 is not divisible by 5, the entire expression for ab cannot be divisible by 5. This is a contradiction because we were given that ab is divisible by 5.

Therefore, the shortest distance from any point (P = (x, e^x)) on (y = e^x) to the curve (y = ln x) will occur through the line (y = x). 2. **Distance from point to line:** - Consider point (P(x, e^x)) on (y = e^x). The perpendicular distance from point (P) to the line (y = x) is given by: [ d(x) = frac{|e^x - x|}{sqrt{2}} ] 3. **Find the Critical Points:** - To minimize (d(x)), we should examine its derivative: [ d'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{|e^x - x|}{sqrt{2}}right) ] Since we are interested in the critical points, we differentiate (e^x - x): First, consider the case (e^x > x): [ f(x) = e^x - x, quad f'(x) = e^x - 1 ] - Setting (f'(x)) to zero: [ e^x - 1 = 0 implies e^x = 1 implies x = 0 ] 4. **Analyze the function behavior:** - For (x > 0), (e^x > 1) hence (f'(x) = e^x - 1 > 0 Rightarrow d(x)) is increasing. - For (x < 0), (e^x < 1 Rightarrow f'(x) = e^x - 1 < 0 Rightarrow d(x)) is decreasing.

Thus, the line always passes through the fixed point P(-1, -2). To find the coordinates of the point P symmetric about the line x + y = 0, we can use the property that the midpoint of the segment connecting a point and its reflection about a line lies on the line. The midpoint M of the segment connecting P and its reflection P' can be calculated as follows: M = left(frac{x_P + x_{P'}}{2}, frac{y_P + y_{P'}}{2}right) Since M lies on the line x + y = 0, we have frac{x_P + x_{P'}}{2} + frac{y_P + y_{P'}}{2} = 0. Substituting the coordinates of P(-1, -2) into the equation, we get: frac{-1 + x_{P'}}{2} + frac{-2 + y_{P'}}{2} = 0 x_{P'} + y_{P'} = 3 Additionally, since P' is the reflection of P about the line x + y = 0, the distance between P and P' is equal to the distance between P and the line. The distance between a point (x_0, y_0) and a line ax + by + c = 0 is given by the formula: d = frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} In our case, the distance between P(-1, -2) and the line x + y = 0 is: d = frac{|(-1) + (-2)|}{sqrt{1^2 + 1^2}} = frac{3}{sqrt{2}} The distance between P and P' is also d, so we can use the distance formula to obtain another equation for x_{P'} and y_{P'}: sqrt{(x_{P'} + 1)^2 + (y_{P'} + 2)^2} = frac{3}{sqrt{2}} Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get: 2x_{P'}^2 + 2y_{P'}^2 + 4x_{P'} + 8y_{P'} + 5 = 0 Now we have a system of two equations and two unknowns: begin{cases} x_{P'} + y_{P'} = 3 2x_{P'}^2 + 2y_{P'}^2 + 4x_{P'} + 8y_{P'} + 5 = 0 end{cases} Solving this system, we find the coordinates of the point P': (2, 1).

Now, we express the sum: [ a^2 + b^2 = (2k + 1)^2 + (2l + 1)^2 ] 4. We expand the squares: [ (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 quad text{and} quad (2l + 1)^2 = 4l^2 + 4l + 1 ] 5.

From the expanded form, we see that (a^2 + b^2) must equal: [ a^2 + b^2 = 4m + 2 quad (m in mathbb{Z}) ] Therefore, (a^2 + b^2 ) when divided by 8 must give a remainder of 2: [ a^2 + b^2 equiv 2 pmod{8} ] 7. Next, we analyze N of the form (222ldots2). For it to satisfy the condition, (N pmod{8}) must also give a remainder of 2.

For numbers with more than one 2, say (22ldots2), we need to establish their modulo: - Suppose (N) has multiple digits of (2), we can represent (N) as (22ldots2 cdot 10^k + 2): [ N = 222 ldots 2 = 22 ldots 2 cdot 10^{k} + 2 ] Already, (10^k equiv 0 pmod{8}) (since (10 equiv 2 pmod{8}) and higher powers evolve similarly). - Thus, the first component (22ldots2 cdot 100 equiv 0 pmod{8}), leaving only ( equiv 2 ). Therefore, the remaining part (2) ensures the remainder evolves to (6) due to (2cdot (1000 k ldots) = 8k), leaving it the form (2.). 9.

Find the volume of the intersection of the original cube and the rotated one.","completion":"To find the volume of the common part of the original cube and the rotated cube, we follow these steps: 1. **Rotation Configuration**: - Let the cube ( A B C D A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1 ) be rotated about the diagonal ( AC_1 ) by an angle ( alpha ). 2. **Definition of Points**: - Consider points ( K ) and ( L ) on edges ( A_1 B_1 ) and ( A_1 D_1 ), respectively, such that ( A_1 K = A_1 L = x ). 3. **Perpendicular Projection to Diagonal**: - Drop perpendiculars from ( K ) and ( L ) to the diagonal ( AC_1 ). Due to the symmetry of the cube relative to the plane ( ACC_1A_1 ), these perpendiculars will intersect at a point ( M ) on the diagonal ( AC_1 ). 4. **Angle Condition**: - Let the value of ( x ) be chosen such that ( angle KML = alpha ). After rotation about the diagonal ( AC_1 ) in a counterclockwise direction (when viewed from ( A ) to ( C_1 )), point ( K ) will move to ( L ). 5. **Edge Midpoints and Additional Points**: - Take points ( P ) and ( Q ) on edges ( B_1 A_1 ) and ( B_1 B ), respectively, at the same distance ( x ) from vertex ( B_1 ). After the same rotation, point ( Q ) will move to ( P ). 6. **Pyramid Volume Calculation**: - Consequently, the face ( ABB_1A_1 ) will, after rotation, pass through points ( A ), ( L ), and ( P ), creating a pyramid ( AA_1PL ). The volume of this pyramid is given by: [ V_{pyramid} = frac{1}{6} a x (a - x) ] 7. **Cube Volume Subtraction**: - The same reasoning applies to all faces. Thus, the total volume to be subtracted consists of 6 such pyramids.

If p and q is false and p or q is true, find the range of values for x.","completion":"To solve the problem, we'll start by finding the conditions under which the propositions p and q are true: For proposition p to be true, the inequality frac{1}{x-2} < 0 must hold. This inequality is true when x-2 is negative, which implies x < 2. Note that x cannot be equal to 2, since this would make the denominator of the fraction zero, which is undefined. For proposition q to be true, the inequality x^{2}-4x-5 < 0 must hold. We can solve this quadratic inequality by factoring: [ x^{2}-4x-5 = (x-5)(x+1) < 0 ] Now, we use a sign chart to determine the intervals where the product is negative. The zeros of the factors are x = 5 and x = -1. Testing intervals around these points gives us: - For x < -1, both factors are negative, so their product is positive. - For -1 < x < 5, one factor is negative and the other is positive, so their product is negative. - For x > 5, both factors are positive, so their product is also positive. Therefore, the inequality x^{2}-4x-5 < 0 holds true for -1 < x < 5. Now let's analyze the logical statements given in the problem. Since \\" p and q\\" is false, it means at least one of the propositions p or q must be false. Since \\" p or q\\" is true, it means at least one of the propositions p or q must be true. Considering these facts together, we have two cases: 1. Proposition p is true, and proposition q is false. This corresponds to x < 2 (from p) and x notin (-1, 5) (from the negation of q).

Since the first condition gives us x = 500 and the second condition gives us x = 150, there is no single value that satisfies both conditions as they are currently interpreted. Let's assume that the second condition should be an equality rather than an inequality to find a consistent solution: 0.20x = 0.50 * 180 - 60 0.20x = 90 - 60 0.20x = 30 x = 30 / 0.20 x = 150 Now, we have a consistent value for x that satisfies both conditions: x = 150. 3. y is 75% of x, and y^2 is more than x by 100.

An odd function satisfies the condition f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in the domain. We also know that tan(x) is an odd function and cos(x + m) is an even function when m is a constant. However, for f(x) to be odd as a sum of tan(x) and cos(x + m), cos(x + m) must not remain even. This will occur if and only if cos(x + m) acts like an odd function about x = 0. The cosine function is symmetric about x = 0, so cos(x + m) will act like an odd function if m = frac{pi}{2} + kpi, where k is an integer. We also use the property of odd functions that f(0) = 0: f(0) = tan(0) + cos(m) = cos(m) = 0. The cosine function is zero at m = frac{pi}{2} + kpi for k an integer. Therefore: m = frac{pi}{2} + kpi, quad k in mathbb{Z}. Next, we solve the inequality m^2 - 3m - 10 < 0. Factoring the quadratic, we get: (m - 5)(m + 2) < 0, which implies that m is between -2 and 5 (not including the endpoints). Combining the two conditions for m, m = frac{pi}{2} + kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}, and m in (-2, 5), the values of m that satisfy both are: m = -frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}, text{ or } frac{3pi}{2}.

Conclusion: 1. Vectors confirm the formation of non-convex polygons because of their summation to zero and diverse directions. 2. Sequential but intersecting paths of these vectors reinforce the presence of self-intersecting polygon structures. Thus, both the non-convex quadrilateral and a self-intersecting polygon can be constructed from the given vectors.

When projecting these vectors onto a line perpendicular to the base of the pyramid, note the following: - The projection of vectors along the edges of the base (1975-gon) onto this perpendicular line is zero. This is because all these edges lie in the plane of the base, which is orthogonal to the line of projection. - The projection of vectors along the edges connecting the apex to the base (side edges of the pyramid) will be either ( +v ) or ( -v ), where ( v ) is a fixed vector in the direction along the perpendicular line. 4. **Sum of Vector Projections:** There are 1975 side edges in the pyramid: - Each of these vectors' projections on the perpendicular line can be ( +v ) or ( -v ). - For the sum of these projections to be zero, the number of ( +v ) vectors and the number of ( -v ) vectors must be equal. 5. **Analyzing Parity:** However, since 1975 is an odd number, it is impossible to evenly split 1975 into an equal number of ( +v ) and ( -v ) projections.

We must show that the midpoints of segments ( AA' ), ( BB' ), and ( CC' ) lie on a single straight line. 2. **Consider the Translation and Flip:** To simplify, observe that if we leave triangle ( A'B'C' ) fixed and translate triangle ( ABC ) by some vector ( boldsymbol{a} ), the midpoints of segments ( AA' ), ( BB' ), and ( CC' ) will move by ( frac{1}{2} boldsymbol{a} ).

The inradius of the triangle is denoted by ( r ), and the height from vertex ( A ) to side ( BC ) is denoted by ( h ). 2. **Expressing the Ratio ( frac{XY}{BC} )**: Because ( XY ) is a tangent line to the incircle ( omega ) drawn parallel to ( BC ), the distance between ( XY ) and ( BC ) is equal to a certain length minus ( 2r ) (twice the radius of the incircle, accounting for the tangents).

This is because the tens digit (or any higher place digit) of a number does not affect its units digit after multiplication. Therefore, we can simplify our problem to finding the units digit of 2^{22(11^{11})}. 2. **Observation 2:** The ones digits of powers of 2 cycle in a pattern: 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16 (units digit is 6), and then 2^5 = 32 (units digit is 2 again). This pattern of 2, 4, 8, 6 repeats every 4 powers of 2. 3. **Determining the Relevant Power:** We need to find out where 22(11^{11}) fits in this cycle of 4. Specifically, we are interested in the remainder when 22(11^{11}) is divided by 4 because this will tell us which number in the cycle of 2, 4, 8, 6 we should look at. 4. **Calculation of the Remainder:** Since 22(11^{11}) is even, it is divisible by 2. However, since it is not divisible by 4 (as 22 leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, and raising 11 to any power does not change this aspect of divisibility by 4), it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. This means that 22(11^{11}) equiv 2 pmod{4}. 5. **Conclusion:** Given the cycle of units digits for powers of 2 is 2, 4, 8, 6, and that 22(11^{11}) leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, we are in the second position of the cycle.

Our goal is to demonstrate that these regions can be colored in a chessboard-like manner (adjacent areas are colored differently), which naturally supports the possibility of alternating tunnels above and below at intersections. 3. **Establishing the chessboard coloring:** To validate this, we can: - Consider a line without vertical segments for simplicity. - From any region, draw a vertical ray extending upwards. If this vertical ray crosses the boundary an **even** number of times, we classify the region as **even**; otherwise, it's **odd**. - Note: Intersection points (both self-intersections and boundary touches) count as two instances. 4. **Consistency of region classification:** The classification of a region (even or odd) must be validated as independent of the starting point within that region. Vertically moving within the region does not change the count of intersections with the lines.

If Jane still needs 4 pennies, then the possible amounts of change she needs are 4, 9, 14, ..., 99 cents. However, as the amount must be less than one dollar, the possible values are 4, 9, 14, ..., 94 cents. For amounts in dimes, the remainder when the amount is divided by 10 must be 7. Thus, the possible amounts Jane could be getting are 7, 17, 27, ..., 97 cents. The overlap of both conditions (amounts ending in 4 from nickels and 7 from dimes) occurs at amounts that are less than one dollar. Checking each, we see that 7 and 94 cents are the amounts that satisfy both conditions (the amounts from nickels that end in 4 do not align with amounts from dimes ending in 7, except 94, which ends in 4 and can be achieved by both nickels and one dime and 4 pennies).

These points are placed on the sides ( AB, BC, CD ), and ( AD ) of the square ( ABCD ) respectively. We know that the sides of the rectangle are parallel to the diagonals of the square, i.e., ( KN parallel BD ) and ( KL parallel AC ). 2. Given that the diagonal of the square is ( 6 ), we can determine the side length of the square. The diagonal of a square with side length ( s ) is given by: [ d = ssqrt{2} ] Given ( d = 6 ), we solve for ( s ): [ 6 = ssqrt{2} ] [ s = frac{6}{sqrt{2}} = frac{6sqrt{2}}{2} = 3sqrt{2} ] 3. Since ( KN parallel BD ) and ( KL parallel AC ), the rectangle ( KLNM ) is aligned such that its sides are aligned with the diagonals of the square. This ensures that the rectangle's sides are effectively the mid-segments of the triangles formed by cutting the square’s diagonals. 4. The rectangle ( KLNM ) divides the area of the square into similar quadrilateral symmetric shapes. To understand the lengths of the sides of the rectangle ( KL ) and ( KN ): [ KL = AC = ssqrt{2} = 3sqrt{2} sqrt{2} = 3 cdot 2 = 6 ] [ KN = BD = ssqrt{2} = 3sqrt{2} sqrt{2} = 3 cdot 2 = 6 ] 5.

Given that the distance from point M(2,y_0) to the focus of the parabola is 3, let's denote the focus by F. The coordinates of F are left(frac{p}{2}, 0right) because for a parabola y^2 = 2px, the focus lies on the x-axis at a distance of frac{p}{2} from the origin.

Find the value of the real number m.","completion":"Given that the power function f(x) = (m^{2}+2m-2)x^{m} is a decreasing function on the interval (0, +infty), we need to find the value of m. To determine the condition for f(x) to be decreasing, we first observe that for a power function of the form ax^{b} to be decreasing, we need a > 0 when b < 0 and a < 0 when b > 0. Here, since x^m is in the form of ax^b with a = m^{2}+2m-2 and b = m, the condition for f(x) to be decreasing translates to ensuring m^{2}+2m-2 is positive or negative depending on the sign of m. However, the solution provided utilizes a different approach by stating that m^{2}+2m-2 = 1, which seems to be derived from a misunderstanding of the conditions for a power function to decrease. Instead, it appears the solution attempted to equate the coefficient to a value that would make the function decrease without proper justification. Nonetheless, to adhere to the provided solution, let us correct the approach by examining the necessary conditions for f(x) to be decreasing across the entire interval (0, +infty). 1. **Solving the Corrected Equation:** The correct approach involves understanding that for f(x) to be decreasing, the derivative f'(x) must be negative for all x > 0. Without explicitly differentiating, the solution asserts an equation m^{2} + 2m - 2 = 1 which seems to be a misstep. The correct equation, based on the original solution's intent, would relate to the characteristics of m but should stem from the derivative. Ignoring this, we proceed with the solution's steps for educational purposes: - m^{2} + 2m - 2 = 1 - Simplifies to m^{2} + 2m - 3 = 0 2. **Solving the Quadratic Equation:** Solving m^{2} + 2m - 3 = 0, we find the roots of the equation by factorization or using the quadratic formula, which results in: - (m + 3)(m - 1) = 0 - Therefore, m = -3 or m = 1 3. **Determining the Correct Value of m:** - For m = -3, f(x) = x^{-3}, which is indeed a decreasing function on (0, +infty). - For m = 1, f(x) = x, which is an increasing function on (0, +infty), contradicting the given condition. Given the requirement for f(x) to be decreasing, the acceptable value of m is m = -3.

Without loss of generality, let angle ACD be a right angle. Let's denote angle BAC = varphi. Consequently, for the triangle ABD having angle ABD = varphi, it implies angle BAD = varphi, implying AC = AD (which seems impossible). 3. **Determine the correct angles for consistency:** Considering angle BAD neq varphi, implies angle ABD = varphi because AC neq AD.

After that, we divide the new total production by the new number of days to find the new average. The average daily production for the past n days was 50 units. Since n = 9, the total production for the past 9 days is: Total production for 9 days = Average daily production × Number of days Total production for 9 days = 50 units/day × 9 days Total production for 9 days = 450 units Today's production is 90 units.

Assume ABCD is tangential and let omega be its incircle. 6. **Three-Center Theorem:** From the three-center theorem, it follows that the points S, P, Q are collinear (since they are the centers of homotheties that map omega_1 to omega_2, omega to omega_1, and omega_2 to omega with positive coefficients). 7. **Reverse Argument:** Conversely, assume that S lies on PQ. Let omega be an excircle of the triangle CDQ, tangent to side CD. Let T be the center of the homothety mapping omega to omega_1 with a positive coefficient. Using the three-center theorem again, T, Q, S must be collinear. Therefore, T lies on line PQ and PC. Hence, T coincides with P. 8. **Tangency Condition:** Consequently, the line PB is tangent to omega, meaning quadrilateral ABCD is tangential around omega. 9. **Equality of Radii:** If r_1 = r_2, then omega_1 and omega_2 are symmetric relative to the angle bisector of angle ADC. The second condition can be transformed: [ HI_1 = HI_2 Rightarrow DH perp I_1I_2 Rightarrow I_1I_2 parallel PQ. ] If quadrilateral ABCD is tangential, omega is symmetric relative to line ell. Therefore, lines BA and BC, DC and DA are symmetric relative to ell.

As tangents of omega_1 and omega_2, points P and Q are symmetric relative to DH. Thus lines BA and BC are symmetric relative to DH, implying quadrilateral ABCD is symmetric relative to DH, hence tangential. # Conclusion: Quadrilateral ABCD is tangential if and only if the incircles of triangles ADP and CDQ viewed from point H form equal angles.

Therefore, the equation of line ( l ) is: [ y = x - 1 ] 3. To find the points of intersection of the line ( l ) with the parabola, we substitute ( y = x - 1 ) into the parabola equation: [ (x-1)^2 = 4x ] Simplifying, we get: [ x^2 - 2x + 1 = 4x ] [ x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0 ] 4.

First, observe that the sum of all elements in the set is -7-5-3-2+2+4+6+13 = 8. Let's denote x = a+b+c+d. Consequently, since a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h are distinct and cover the entire set, e+f+g+h must equal the total sum of the set minus x, which gives us e+f+g+h = 8 - x.

Given that the areas of t_1, t_2, and t_3 are 4, 9, and 49 respectively, we can infer that the sides of these triangles are proportional to the square root of their areas. This is because the area of a triangle can be expressed as K = frac{1}{2}absin C, where a and b are the lengths of two sides and C is the included angle. Since all triangles are similar, the angles remain constant, and thus, the area is proportional to the square of the sides.

For example: [ (ab+c) - (a+b+c) = (a-1)(b-1)-1 > 0 (ac+b) - (ab+c) = (a-1)(c-b) > 0 (bc+a) - (ac+b) = (c-1)(b-a) > 0 b(a+c) - a(b+c) = (b-a)c > 0 c(a+b) - b(a+c) = (c-b)a > 0 abc - c(a+b) = c[(a-1)(b-1)-1] > 0 ] Concluding: [ a+b+c < ab+c < ac+b < bc+a, a(b+c) < b(a+c) < c(a+b) < abc. ] 3. **Step 3: Additional Comparisons** Further comparisons show: [ a(b+c) - (ac+b) = b(a-1) > 0, b(a+c) - (bc+a) = a(b-1) > 0. ] Hence, a(b+c) > ac+b and b(a+c) > bc+a. We infer that if two of the results are equal, it must be (bc+a) and a(b+c) that are potential candidates for equality. 4. **Step 4: Prove Non-Equality Assumption** Suppose: [ bc + a = a(b+c). ] This gives: [ c(b-a) = a(b-1). ] Given a > frac{n}{2}, then: [ c(b-a) > frac{n}{2}(b-1) geq frac{c}{2}(b-1). ] Resulting in: { begin{array}{c} 2(b-a) > b-1, b > 2a-1 > n-1. end{array} } As b > n-1 and c > b, there is a contradiction since c leq n. Thus, bc+a and a(b+c) are not equal, implying all combinations are unique. 5. **Step 5: Case with Prime p** Let a = p leq sqrt{n} leq frac{n}{2} (when n>3). From step (1), if two combinations are equal, they must be bc + a and a(b + c). This results in: { begin{array}{l} bc + p = p(b + c), bc = p(b + c - 1). end{array} } Given p is prime: [ p mid b text{ or } p mid c. ] 6. **Step 6: Case Analysis** if p mid b, let b = beta p (beta > 1): [ beta c = beta p + c - 1, (beta - 1)c = beta p - 1 = b - 1. ] Thus, c mid b - 1, implying c < b, a contradiction since c > b. Therefore, p mid c, let c = gamma p (gamma > 1): { begin{array}{c} gamma b = b + gamma p - 1, (gamma - 1)b = gamma p - 1 = (gamma - 1) + gamma (p - 1). end{array} } This gives: [ b = 1 + frac{gamma (p-1)}{gamma - 1}. ] Since gamma (gamma-1) are co-prime: [ boxed{gamma - 1 mid p-1}, ] And thus: [ b = p+ frac{p - 1}{gamma - 1}> p, ] Ensuring a = p < b < c.

Thus, (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) must be the increasing sequence (1, 2, ldots, n) itself, since we have the condition for all pairs (i, j). Hence, A_n = {(1, 2, 3, ldots, n)}.

Substitute (h_1 + h_2 = a - h): [ h_1^2 + h_2^2 = frac{1}{2} [(a - h)^2 + (h_1 - h_2)^2] ] To minimize (h_1^2 + h_2^2), we set (h_1 = h_2): [ h_1 - h_2 = 0 rightarrow h_1 = h_2 = frac{a - h}{2} ] To maximize (h_1^2 + h_2^2), if one of (h_1) or (h_2) is zero (say (h_1)): [ |h_1 - h_2| = a - h rightarrow h_2 = a - h ] This corresponds to one of the lines passing through a vertex of the rhombus. # Conclusion: [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Determine the area of a triangle using Heron's formula when the side lengths are as follows: a = 2.3 m, b = sqrt(5) m, and c = 4.1 m.","completion":"To find the area of a triangle using Heron's formula, we first need to calculate the semi-perimeter (s) of the triangle, which is given by: s = (a + b + c) / 2 where a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Given: a = 2.3 m b = sqrt(5) m c = 4.1 m Let's calculate the semi-perimeter: s = (2.3 + sqrt(5) + 4.1) / 2 Now, let's calculate the value of sqrt(5): sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236 So, the semi-perimeter is: s ≈ (2.3 + 2.236 + 4.1) / 2 s ≈ (8.636) / 2 s ≈ 4.318 m Now we can use Heron's formula to find the area (A) of the triangle: A = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) Plugging in the values we have: A ≈ sqrt(4.318 * (4.318 - 2.3) * (4.318 - 2.236) * (4.318 - 4.1)) Now let's calculate the differences: (4.318 - 2.3) ≈ 2.018 (4.318 - 2.236) ≈ 2.082 (4.318 - 4.1) ≈ 0.218 So the area is: A ≈ sqrt(4.318 * 2.018 * 2.082 * 0.218) Now let's calculate the product inside the square root: Product ≈ 4.318 * 2.018 * 2.082 * 0.218 Product ≈ 3.899 Finally, we take the square root of the product to find the area: A ≈ sqrt(3.899) A ≈ 1.975 m² Therefore, the area of the triangle is approximately boxed{1.975} square meters."},{"prompt":"A plane touches two tangent spheres with radii ( R ) and ( r ) at points ( A ) and ( B ).

Consider the two spheres of radius ( R ) and ( r ) that touch each other externally, and let ( A ) and ( B ) be the points of tangency of a common tangent plane to both spheres. 2. We need to show that the distance ( AB ) between the points of tangency is ( 2 sqrt{R r} ). 3. To demonstrate this, we will first show that the length of the common external tangent line to two touching circles (or spheres in 2D consideration) of radii ( R ) and ( r ) is ( 2 sqrt{R r} ). 4. Consider a right triangle formed by the centers of the two circles (or spheres) and the points where the common tangent touches the circles. The centers of the circles are at a distance of ( R + r ) from each other since they touch externally. 5. Let ( O_1 ) be the center of the first circle (or sphere) with radius ( R ), and ( O_2 ) be the center of the second circle (or sphere) with radius ( r ). The length of the tangent from any external point (points ( A ) and ( B )) to a circle is equal, forming ( x ). 6. Draw perpendiculars from the centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) to the tangent line at points ( A ) and ( B ), respectively. This gives rise to two right triangles where: - One leg is the radius (( R ) and ( r ) respectively). - The hypotenuse is the distance between the centers ( O_1 O_2 = R + r ). 7. Applying the Pythagorean theorem to the triangle with legs as ( (R - r) ) and ( (R + r) ), we get: [ x^2 + (R - r)^2 = (R + r)^2 ] 8. Simplifying the equation: [ x^2 + R^2 - 2Rr + r^2 = R^2 + 2Rr + r^2 ] 9. Subtract ( R^2 + r^2 ) from both sides: [ x^2 - 2Rr = 2Rr ] 10. Solving for ( x ), we get: [ x^2 = 4Rr ] [ x = 2 sqrt{R r} ] Thus, the length of the common tangent line is ( 2 sqrt{R r} ). 11. Now consider the common tangent plane to the spheres. The section containing the centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) and the tangency points ( A ) and ( B ), which is parallel to the tangent line in 2D consideration, must also measure ( 2 sqrt{R r} ) along that plane. 12.

Let's fix player 1 at a specific position. 2. **Determining the Position of Adjacent Players:** - Player 1 must have players 2 and 3 as its neighbors because the difference between the numbers of any two adjacent players must be 1 or 2. - Without loss of generality, assume player 3 is to the left of player 1 and player 2 is to the right of player 1. 3. **Extending the Arrangement:** - Following the same rule, player 4 must be adjacent to player 3, and player 5 must be adjacent to player 2. - This pattern continues around the table. Specifically, the (k)-th number to the left of player 1 will be (2k + 1), and the (k)-th number to the right of player 1 will be (2k). 4. **Completing the Arrangement:** - By continuing this pattern, we can determine the entire arrangement of the players around the table.

Therefore, frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2} = frac{1}{2}, it follows that a^2 = 2b^2. Let P have coordinates (x, y). Due to the dot product, we have vec{PA} cdot vec{PB} = (-a - x, -y) cdot (a - x, -y) = x^2 - a^2 + y^2 = x^2 - a^2 + frac{a^2}{2} - frac{x^2}{2} = frac{1}{2}(x^2 - a^2). Since -a leq x leq a, the minimum dot product occurs when x = 0, we have (vec{PA} cdot vec{PB})_{text{min}} = -frac{a^2}{2} = -2, which implies that a^2 = 4 and thus b^2 = 2. The equation of ellipse C can therefore be written as: boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{2} = 1}. (2) Given that a^2 = 4 and b^2 = 2, we find c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{2}.

The dot product in this case yields vec{F_{2}M} cdot vec{F_{2}N} = 7. When the line slope does exist, suppose the line MN has the equation y = k(x + sqrt{2}).

Since we have 3 moles of acetic acid initially, only 2 moles will react in this step, producing 2 moles of sodium acetate. Step 2: Reaction of remaining acetic acid with sodium hydroxide The reaction is as follows: CH3COOH + NaOH → NaCH3COO + H2O We initially had 3 moles of acetic acid, and 2 moles have already reacted in step 1, leaving us with 1 mole of acetic acid. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of acetic acid reacts with 1 mole of sodium hydroxide to produce 1 mole of sodium acetate.

This implies that for any point ( (x, P(x)) ) on the graph, the point ( (2a - x, 2b - P(x)) ) is also on the graph. Mathematically, this can be written as: [ P(2a - x) = 2b - P(x). ] 3. **Polynomial Form**: Since the graph passes through the point ( A(a, b) ), we can write: [ P(a) = b. ] 4. **Expressing ( P(x) )**: We can express ( P(x) ) in the form: [ P(x) = (x-a)R(x) + b, ] where ( R(x) ) is some polynomial. 5. **Symmetry Condition in Terms of ( R(x) )**: Using the symmetry condition ( P(2a - x) = 2b - P(x) ), we substitute ( P(x) ) and ( P(2a - x) ): [ P(2a - x) = (2a - x - a)R(2a - x) + b = (a - x)R(2a - x) + b, ] and [ 2b - P(x) = 2b - ((x-a)R(x) + b) = b - (x-a)R(x). ] 6. **Equating the Two Expressions**: From the symmetry condition, we have: [ (a - x)R(2a - x) + b = b - (x-a)R(x). ] Simplifying, we get: [ (a - x)R(2a - x) = -(x-a)R(x). ] Dividing both sides by ( x-a ) (assuming ( x neq a )): [ R(2a - x) = -R(x). ] 7. **Even Function**: Let ( u = x - a ).

However, as per the problem, we need distinct digits. Next, we check 876, since 76 modulo 4 is 0, and the sum of digits, 8+7+6=21, is divisible by 3. Now, check divisibility by its digits: - Divisibility by 8: 876 div 8 = 109.5 (fails) - Divisibility by 7: 876 div 7 = 125.14 (success) - Divisibility by 6: 876 div 6 = 146 (success) Since 876 fails divisibility by 8, we continue looking: - Try 864 (since 64 modulo 4 is 0 and 8+6+4=18 divisible by 3): - Divisibility by 8: 864 div 8 = 108 (success) - Divisibility by 6: 864 div 6 = 144 (success) - Divisibility by 4: 864 div 4 = 216 (success) boxed{864} meets all requirements."},{"prompt":"Suppose that x is a positive multiple of 4.

We are given that P = 100 and F = 120 - P = 120 - 100 = 20. The average marks of passed candidates is 39, so the total marks obtained by passed candidates is 39 * P = 39 * 100. The average marks of failed candidates is 15, so the total marks obtained by failed candidates is 15 * F = 15 * 20. The overall average of marks obtained by all candidates is the total marks obtained by all candidates divided by the total number of candidates. Total marks obtained by all candidates = Total marks by passed candidates + Total marks by failed candidates = (39 * 100) + (15 * 20) Now, let's calculate the total marks obtained by all candidates: Total marks by passed candidates = 39 * 100 = 3900 Total marks by failed candidates = 15 * 20 = 300 Total marks by all candidates = 3900 + 300 = 4200 Now, we can find the overall average by dividing the total marks by the total number of candidates: Overall average = Total marks by all candidates / Total number of candidates = 4200 / 120 Now, let's calculate the overall average: Overall average = 4200 / 120 = 35 Therefore, the overall average of marks obtained by all candidates is boxed{35} ."},{"prompt":"Determine the value of k that will make the expression x^2 20x + k the square of a binomial.","completion":"We start by assuming that x^2 - 20x + k can be expressed as the square of a binomial, i.e., (x + b)^2.

What is the minimum number of coins you need to take out to be sure of knowing the contents of at least one pouch?","completion":"1. **Identify the Type of Coin in Each Bag:** - The pirate has five bags with coins, each containing exactly 30 coins. - There are three bags with only one type of coin each: one with gold coins, one with silver coins, and one with bronze coins. - The other two bags contain a mix of gold, silver, and bronze coins in equal proportions (10 gold, 10 silver, and 10 bronze in each mixed bag). 2. **Examining the Strategy to Minimize Coin Count:** - The goal is to determine the contents of at least one bag with certainty by drawing the least number of coins. - If we draw one coin from each bag, there will be a total of five coins. These belong to the following scenarios: - One coin from the bag of gold coins. - One coin from the bag of silver coins. - One coin from the bag of bronze coins. - One coin from each of the two mixed bags. These can also be gold, silver, or bronze. 3. **Justification for Drawing Five Coins:** - Suppose we draw coins from four different bags, getting four coins in total. Since three of the bags contain pure gold, silver, or bronze coins, and any of them might correspond to any of the drawn coins, we can't definitively ascertain which bag each type belongs to. - Here’s why: - The four coins could be, for instance, gold, gold, silver, and bronze. - In this situation, the three pure type bags and two mixed bags could still lead to ambiguous sorting of the bags. Thus, it is not enough to identify the specific bag of one pure type of coin. 4. **Drawing Coins to Identify Distinctly:** - By drawing a coin from each of the five bags, we ensure that there is at least one distinct coin type that sufficiently identifies its bag: - For example, if we draw a gold coin that is unique among the five drawn coins (assuming that no two gold coins are drawn if mixed bags do not repeat), it confirms that the bag containing this gold coin is purely the gold coin bag. - Similarly, drawing a unique silver or bronze coin will identify its respective pure type bag. - The mixed bag coins, if drawn, will always have a pair in their drawing, confirming the mixed bag status indirectly. 5. **Ensuring Identification in Drawing Five Coins:** - With five draws, one coin from each bag ensures that duplicates will not mask unique identifiers. - This guarantees recognizing at least one pure-type coin bag definitively, as mixed bag contents will match only each other. # Conclusion The minimal number of coins that must be drawn to ascertain the contents of at least one of the bags with certainty is: [ boxed{5} ]"},{"prompt":"Consider the number R_k whose baseten representation is composed of k consecutive ones, for example, R_3 = 111, R_5 = 11111, etc. Let's define R_{18} and R_6.

This point M has the property that the chords BM and CM subtend equal angles at the circle and thus are equal in length, i.e., BM = CM. 2. **Angles Subtended by Chords**: Since BM = CM, the angles angle KBM and angle KCM are equal. Consequently, angle ABM and angle QCM are also equal. 3. **Use Similar Triangles**: We now establish that triangles ABM and QCM are similar by showing they have two sides and the included angle equal. Specifically, we use the conditions AB = CQ and angle ABM = angle QCM. 4. **Calculate Equality of Distances**: From the similarity of triangles ABM and QCM, it follows that AM = QM.

Consider the expression ( s^2 + t^2 ): [ s^2 + t^2 = (sin(64x) + sin(65x))^2 + (cos(64x) + cos(65x))^2. ] 2.

Given that ( cos(x) ) is rational, we know that the cosine of any multiple of ( x ), specifically ( cos(2^k x) ), will also be rational due to the recursive formula: [ cos(2a) = 2 cos^2(a) - 1 ] Using this, it follows for any nonnegative integer ( k ), ( cos(2^k x) ) remains rational.

There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so the journey is 9 kilometers * 1000 meters/kilometer = 9000 meters. Each unicorn takes steps of 3 meters, so the number of steps one unicorn takes to cover 9000 meters is 9000 meters / 3 meters/step = 3000 steps.

Since the rest of the non-throwers are right-handed, we subtract the number of left-handed players from the non-throwers to find out how many are right-handed: 39 non-throwers - 13 left-handed players = 26 right-handed players who are not throwers.

Additionally, the digit 0 is not used. 2. We note that there are 9 different letters used in the cryptarithm. This implies that all non-zero digits (1 through 9) should be used exactly once. 3. Considering the denominator (K+J+A+C+C), we know it must be equal to 29 for the fraction (frac{22}{29}) to be in its simplest form. This insight comes from the fact that 22 and 29 are relatively prime, and no other fraction should simplify to (frac{22}{29}). 4. Next, we need to ensure the numerator (B+O+C+b+M+O+breve{U}) sums to 22 while each letter corresponds to a unique digit. Observe that (O) appears twice in the numerator, so we must account for this duplication. 5. Since all digits from 1 to 9 are used and (22div29) is in simplest form, thus: - (K + J + A + C + C = 29) - (B + O + C + b + M + O + breve{U} = 22) 6. To explore the values, let's consider the possible values for digits: - We try different permutations ensuring that their sum exactly matches the given numbers. 7. For the denominator, let's check values satisfying (K + J + A + C + C = 29) with distinct digits from 1 to 9: - One feasible combination would be (K=9, J=8, A=7, C=5). However, adding such values shows: [ 9 + 8 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 34 ] - Another set (K=8, J=7, A=6, C=4): [ 8 + 7 + 6 + 4 + 4 = 29 ] 8. Therefore from above setup (K=8, J=7, A=6, C=4). 9. This restricts 1, 2, 3, 5 remaining for numerator (B, O, C, b, M, breve{U}). But verifying denomination has conflict to achieve digit summation as 29. 10.
