Also, denote the distances from P to the sides B_{1} B_{2}, B_{2} B_{3}, ..., B_{n} B_{1} as b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n respectively. Referencing the fundamental property discussed in the problem (reference found in 1971 exercise, page 211): 1. The geometric mean of the distances from any point P on the circle to the tangents is equal to the distance from P to the line joining the two tangent points.

The left-hand side can be rewritten as: [ a_1 a_2 ldots a_n a_1 = (a_1)^2 a_2 ldots a_{n-1} ] Because every term a_i appears exactly twice (once from the previous term and once as the leading term in the next multiplication). 5.

Taking square roots of both sides: [ a_1 a_2 ldots a_n = b_1 b_2 ldots b_n ] Since a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n are non-negative quantities, the equality a_1 a_2 ldots a_n = b_1 b_2 ldots b_n holds based on this geometric consideration.

Since A is the initial average weight, we can express T as: T = 10A When the man weighing 58 kg is replaced by a new man M, the total weight becomes T - 58 + M, and the average weight increases by 2.5 kg. So the new average weight is A + 2.5. Since there are still 10 men, we can express the new total weight as: T - 58 + M = 10(A + 2.5) Now we have two equations: 1) T = 10A 2) T - 58 + M = 10A + 25 We can substitute the value of T from equation 1 into equation 2: 10A - 58 + M = 10A + 25 Now, we can solve for M: M = 58 + 25 M = 83 kg So the weight of the new man M is 83 kg. Now, we need to find the value of A. We can use the fact that the total weight increased by the difference in weight between the new man and the man he replaced, which is M - 58 kg. This increase is spread over 10 men, so each man's average weight increases by (M - 58) / 10 kg.

Similarly, if the other person can complete the job in 6 hours, their rate B is 1/6 of the job per hour. When they work together, their combined rate is A + B. Since they can complete the job in 1 hour together, their combined rate must be 1 job per hour. So we have: A + B = 1 job/hour Substituting the rates we know: (1/4) + (1/6) = 1 job/hour To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12 in this case: (3/12) + (2/12) = 1 job/hour (5/12) = 1 job/hour This means that together, they complete 5/12 of the job per hour.

Denote by ( overrightarrow{OS} ) the sum of any selected several vectors from ( overrightarrow{OA_1}, overrightarrow{OA_2}, ldots, overrightarrow{OA_{25}} ). 3. Draw a line ( l ) passing through the center ( O ) of the 25-gon, which is perpendicular to the vector ( overrightarrow{OS} ). 4. Suppose that among the selected vectors, there is a vector ( overrightarrow{OA} ) that lies on the line ( l ) or on the opposite side of ( l ) compared to ( overrightarrow{OS} ). This means that the vector ( overrightarrow{OA} ) is contributing negatively to the length of the sum ( overrightarrow{OS} ). 5. If this vector ( overrightarrow{OA} ) is removed from the selected set, the new sum vector (let’s denote this new sum as ( overrightarrow{OS'} )), would have a greater length. This is because the length of the vector sum is maximized by vectors aligned in the same direction, not by vectors opposing each other. Consider the triangle ( OAS ): Since ( OAS ) is a right triangle or an obtuse triangle, the hypotenuse ( SA ) is greater than the length of the vector ( overrightarrow{OS} ): [ SA > OS. ] Here, ( SA = | overrightarrow{OS} - overrightarrow{OA} | ). 6. Further, suppose there is a vector ( overrightarrow{OB} ) which was not included in the initial selection and lies on the same side of ( l ) as ( overrightarrow{OS} ). Adding this vector ( overrightarrow{OB} ) to the set increases the length of the new vector sum: [ O B' = | overrightarrow{OS} + overrightarrow{OB} |. ] By the parallelogram law in the context of a triangle ( OB' S ), ( OB' ) is greater than ( OS ): [ OB' > OS. ] 7. From here, to maximize the sum of vectors, we should choose vectors that are successive and form the smallest angle with ( overrightarrow{OS} ).

Let's consider the product n(n+1). This is the product of two consecutive integers, which means one of them must be even and the other odd. Since 17 is a prime number, for n(n+1) to be divisible by 17, at least one of the factors (n or n+1) must be divisible by 17. Let's consider two cases: Case 1: n is divisible by 17. If n is divisible by 17, then n can be written as 17k, where k is an integer. The values of n that are divisible by 17 in the range from 1 to 1000 are 17, 34, 51, ..., 17 * 58, 17 * 59. To find the number of such values, we divide 1000 by 17 and take the integer part of the result. This gives us 1000 / 17 = 58 with a remainder, so there are 59 integers n that are divisible by 17 in the range from 1 to 1000. Case 2: n+1 is divisible by 17. If n+1 is divisible by 17, then n+1 can be written as 17k, where k is an integer. This means n can be written as 17k - 1. The values of n that satisfy this condition in the range from 1 to 1000 are 16, 33, 50, ..., 17 * 58 - 1, 17 * 59 - 1. Again, we divide 1000 by 17 and take the integer part of the result. This gives us 1000 / 17 = 58 with a remainder, so there are 59 integers n that satisfy n+1 being divisible by 17 in the range from 1 to 1000. However, we must be careful not to double-count the case where both n and n+1 are divisible by 17, which is not possible since 17 is a prime number and cannot divide two consecutive integers. Therefore, the total number of integers n for which n(n+1) is divisible by 17 is the sum of the numbers from both cases, which is 59 + 59 = 118. The probability that a randomly selected integer n from 1 to 1000 will have the property that n(n+1) is divisible by 17 is the number of successful outcomes (118) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (1000).

This algorithm can be described and proved through the following steps: 1. **Algorithm Explanation:** The Zeckendorf representation states that each positive integer can be uniquely represented as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. To obtain this representation, we use the following greedy approach: - Start with the given integer ( n ). - Find the largest Fibonacci number ( F_i ) such that ( F_i leq n ). - Subtract ( F_i ) from ( n ) and repeat the process with the remainder until ( n ) becomes 0. This can be mathematically written as: [ n = F_{i_1} + F_{i_2} + cdots + F_{i_k} ] where ( i_1, i_2, ldots, i_k ) are indices of Fibonacci numbers such that ( F_{i_j} leq n ), and no consecutive indices ( i_j ) and ( i_{j+1} ) differ by 1, ensuring no two consecutive Fibonacci numbers are used. 2. **Proof:** To show any positive integer ( n ) can be represented in this manner and that the representation is unique, we proceed by induction on ( n ). **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), the largest Fibonacci number that does not exceed 1 is ( F_2 = 1 ). Thus, the representation is: [ 1 = F_2 ] **Inductive Step:** Assume that all numbers less than or equal to some ( k ) can be represented uniquely following the Zeckendorf representation theory. We need to show that ( k+1 ) can also be uniquely represented in this form. - Find the largest Fibonacci number ( F_m ) such that ( F_m leq k+1 ). - Let ( k+1 = F_m + r ), where ( r ) is the remainder when ( F_m ) is subtracted from ( k+1 ), so ( r = k+1 - F_m ). - By the induction hypothesis, ( r ), being less than or equal to ( k ), has a unique Zeckendorf representation without consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Since ( F_m ) is the largest Fibonacci number that can be subtracted from ( k+1 ) and ( r ) has a unique representation as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers, the representation for ( k+1 ) is also unique. 3. **No Consecutive Ones:** The algorithm inherently avoids having consecutive Fibonacci numbers in the sum. This directly means that the binary representation using coefficients ( b_k ) will inherently avoid consecutive 1s. **Conclusion:** Every natural number ( n ) can be represented uniquely as ( n = sum_{k=2}^{m} b_k F_k ) where ( b_k ) are either 0 or 1 and no two consecutive ( b_k )s are 1.

Here, we have three vertices and only two colors. Hence, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two vertices among ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) must be of the same color. 5. **Identifying Points with the Same Color** Suppose vertices ( A ) and ( B ) are of the same color. (The argument holds similarly if ( A ) and ( C ) or ( B ) and ( C ) are of the same color due to the symmetry of the problem). 6. **Distance Examination** The distance between ( A ) and ( B ) is: [ AB = x ] Therefore, there exist two points (vertices ( A ) and ( B )) that are of the same color and are exactly ( x ) distance apart. # Conclusion We have shown that for any strictly positive real number ( x ), we can ensure the existence of two points of the same color that are exactly ( x ) distance apart by leveraging the construction of an equilateral triangle and the pigeonhole principle.

Step 2: Applying Power of a Point Theorem Using the Power of a Point theorem at point C with respect to circle A, we have: [ CX cdot BC = CD cdot CE ] where D and E are the intersections of the circle with line AC. Since AD = AE = AB = 86, we can calculate CD and CE as follows: [ CD = AC - AD = 97 - 86 = 11 ] [ CE = AC + AE = 97 + 86 = 183 ] Thus, the equation becomes: [ CX cdot (CX + BX) = 11 cdot 183 ] [ CX cdot (CX + BX) = 2013 ] Step 3: Factoring and Analyzing the Equation The prime factorization of 2013 is 3 cdot 11 cdot 61.

The multiplication outcomes then become: [ left( a-b-c right)( a+b+c )( a-b+c )( a+b-c ) ] This results from the identity used in simplifying polynomial expressions. 7.

The directrix of the parabola is then a horizontal line y = -4. Next, we identify the asymptotes of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. The asymptotes are straight lines that are defined by the equation frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 0 which gives us two lines y = pmfrac{b}{a}x.

The problem involves constructing isosceles trapezoids where one base, (AB), is a constant length, and both diagonals, (AC) and (BD), are equal and have a given constant length. 2. To construct such a trapezoid, we need to ensure that points (C) and (D) lie on circles centered at (A) and (B) with radii equal to the given diagonal length. This is because triangles (ACA) and (BDB) must be isosceles with their base angles equal. 3. Assume we start by drawing a circle centered at (A) with radius equal to the given diagonal length (let's denote this length as (d)). Let's choose any point (C) on this circle. 4. Next, we identify the corresponding point (D) by drawing a parallel line to (AB) through (C). This line will intersect the circle centered at (B) (also with a radius (d)) at the point (D). 5. The diagonals' intersection points, (O), in different possible trapezoid configurations form a specific geometric shape. By properties of isosceles trapezoids and equal diagonals: [ AO = OD quad text{and} quad BO = OC. ] These equalities indicate that points (O) form a central conic section (ellipse or hyperbola), depending on the relative lengths of (AC) (or (BD)) and (AB). 6. When (AC = AD) (and thus also (BC = BD)), the locus of (O) is an ellipse, as both conditions of the central conic section for an ellipse are satisfied. 7. To find the trapezoid with the minimal perimeter, we consider the perimeter formula of the isosceles trapezoid: [ K = AD + BC + 2AB. ] 8. The perimeter (K) is minimized when (AD + BC) is minimized, as (AB) is constant. 9. Using Ptolemy's theorem (which relates the sides and diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral), we get: [ AD cdot BC = AC cdot BD - AB cdot CD. ] Since (AC = BD = d) and (AD = BC) in this configuration, the product (AD cdot BC) is a constant. 10. Therefore, (AD) and (BC) must be equal for the given product to be maintained with minimal sum, making the trapezoid a rectangle. In conclusion, the diagonals' intersection points lie on an ellipse when viewed geometrically, and the trapezoid with minimal perimeter is a rectangle. Thus, the final geometric conditions are satisfied under these constructions.

If all the side lengths and diagonal lengths of the polygon ( P ) are rational numbers, prove that the side lengths of all the resulting smaller polygons are also rational numbers.","completion":"To prove the theorem, we will first consider a simpler case of a quadrilateral and then extend the proof to general polygons. 1. **Base Case: Quadrilateral** Consider a convex quadrilateral (A B C D). All sides and diagonals of (A B C D) are given to be rational numbers. 2. **Intersection of Diagonals** Let the diagonals (AC) and (BD) intersect at point (P). We need to show that the segments (AP), (BP), (CP), and (DP) are all rational. 3. **Angles and Cosine Values** Define the angles (angle BAP = alpha_1) and (angle DAP = alpha_2). Using the Law of Cosines and the fact that all sides and diagonals are rational, we find that: [ cos alpha_1, cos alpha_2, cos (alpha_1 + alpha_2) ] are all rational. 4. **Sine Product** Using the trigonometric identity: [ sin alpha_1 sin alpha_2 = cos alpha_1 cos alpha_2 - cos (alpha_1 + alpha_2) ] Since (cos alpha_1), (cos alpha_2), and (cos (alpha_1 + alpha_2)) are rational, the product (sin alpha_1 sin alpha_2) is rational. 5. **Ratio of Sines** From the fact that (sin alpha_2) cannot be zero (as (alpha_2) is an angle in a quadrilateral), we can now find: [ frac{sin alpha_1}{sin alpha_2} text{ is rational}. ] 6. **Segment Ratios Using Law of Sines** Using the Law of Sines in triangles (ABP) and (ADP), we establish: [ frac{|BP|}{|PD|} = frac{|AB|}{|AD|} cdot frac{sin alpha_1}{sin alpha_2} ] Since (frac{|AB|}{|AD|}) and (frac{sin alpha_1}{sin alpha_2}) are both rational, (frac{|BP|}{|PD|}) is rational. Next, considering the whole diagonal length: [ |BD| = |BP| + |PD| ] and all lengths involved being rational implies that ( |BP| ) and ( |PD| ) are both rational. Similarly, we can show ( |AP| ) and ( |CP| ) are rational. 7. **Extension to General Polygons** For a general convex polygon ( P ), assume (P) is divided by its diagonals into smaller polygons. Similar arguments can be applied considering various quadrilateral divisions within the polygon. Let (A_i A_j) represent one diagonal and let it intersect another diagonal (A_k A_l) at point (C). We can always inscribe a quadrilateral within the polygon such that the ratios and intersections considered above still hold valid. By repeating the logic as above, namely, considering any quadrilateral formed by vertices and their respective diagonal intersections, we find that all segments of the diagonals being divided into further rational segments holds. **Conclusion:** With all smaller polygons exhibiting rational side lengths upon division, we establish that all sides of the resulting smaller polygons are rational numbers.

To find the range of x that satisfies this inequality, we factor the quadratic expression: [x^{2}-x-6 = (x-3)(x+2)] Setting this equal to zero gives us the roots x=3 and x=-2.

This implies that ( O_1 ) lies on ( k_2 ) and ( O_2 ) lies on ( k_1 ). 2. Points ( A ) and ( B ) are symmetric with respect to the line ( O_1O_2 ). Therefore, the midpoint ( M ) of segment ( AB ) lies on ( O_1O_2 ), and ( AB ) is perpendicular to ( O_1O_2 ). 3. Let ( P ) be an arbitrary point on ( k_2 ). We need to prove that: [ PA^2 + PB^2 geq 2r^2. ] 4. Since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( AB ), the segment ( PM ) is a median in triangle ( APB ). By the median length formula in a triangle, we have: [ 4 cdot PM^2 = 2 cdot (PA^2 + PB^2) - AB^2. ] 5. Rearranging the above equation, we get: [ 2 cdot (PA^2 + PB^2) = 4 cdot PM^2 + AB^2. ] 6. To prove ( PA^2 + PB^2 geq 2r^2 ), it suffices to show: [ 2 cdot (PA^2 + PB^2) geq 4r^2. ] Substituting from the previous equation, this becomes: [ 4 cdot PM^2 + AB^2 geq 4r^2. ] 7. Among all points on ( k_2 ), the point ( O_1 ) is the nearest to ( M ) because ( O_1 ) is where the segment ( MO_2 ) meets ( k_2 ). Thus, ( PM geq O_1M ). 8.

Consider the points of intersection: - Let the lines (A B) and (C D) intersect at point (K). - Let the lines (B C) and (E D) intersect at point (M). 2. Define some angles: - Let (angle B A E = alpha). - Let (angle D E A = beta). 3. On the line (B C), draw segment (B N = A B = 1). 4. If (alpha + beta = 180^circ): - The quadrilateral (A B D E) would be a parallelogram. - Thus, lines (D K) and (B M) would be heights to the opposite sides, making it impossible for them to intersect at point (C). 5. If (alpha + beta > 180^circ): - The points (C) and (P) (intersection of lines (A B) and (D E)) would lie on opposite sides of line (B D). - Point (K) lies on the extension of (D C) beyond (C), implying (K) and (P) lie on opposite sides of line (B D). - Thus, (angle P B M > 90^circ). 6. However, considering (P B M) as an acute angle in the right triangle (P B M), we see a contradiction since (angle P B M < 90^circ). 7. Accordingly, it must be the case that (alpha + beta < 180^circ). 8. Assume one of the angles, say (alpha), is less than (90^circ): - The angles inside quadrilateral (A B M E) sum to (360^circ). - Hence, (angle A B M = 360^circ - 90^circ - alpha - beta = 270^circ - alpha - beta). 9. Using the isosceles triangles (A B N) and (A D E): - (angle B A N = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - angle A B N) = frac{1}{2}(alpha + beta - 90^circ)). - (angle D A E = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - beta) = 90^circ - frac{beta}{2}). 10. Combining these: - (angle B A N + angle D A E = frac{1}{2}(90^circ + alpha) > alpha = angle B A E). 11. This implies that point (D) lies inside triangle (A B N). 12. Let the lines (C D) and (A N) intersect at point (S): - In triangle (C N S): - (angle C N S) is acute. - (angle N S C) is obtuse. - Therefore, (C S < C N). 13.

Furthermore, since f(-4)=-3e^{-4}, f(0)=1>f(-4), the function f(x) has a decreasing interval of [-4, -2) and an increasing interval of (-2, 0], with the maximum value being 1.

We need to determine whether, for every pair of these smaller rectangles, the line segment connecting their centers intersects another smaller rectangle. 2. **Initial assumptions and transformations:** Suppose the original rectangle can be transformed into a square by appropriately scaling one of its sides. This transformation ensures that the problem remains equivalent geometrically, as the relative positions of the centers of the smaller rectangles remain unchanged during scaling. 3. **Reference to a related problem:** Consider the problem akin to the exercise commonly solved in combinatorics, referred to as problem number 111919. It possibly deals with properties of centers or intersections in structured partition problems. 4. **Analysis of centers and intersection properties:** - **Centers of rectangles:** Each smaller rectangle has a center, which is its centroid, located at the midpoint of its diagonals. - **Connecting segments:** The question implies investigating if the segments connecting these centers invariably intersect other rectangles. 5. **Proof by contradiction or counterexample:** - To assert the result, we assume that for any chosen pair of centers (say, (C_1) and (C_2)), the connecting segment ( overline{C_1C_2}) must intersect at least one other smaller rectangle. - Draw a scenario where smaller rectangles are arranged such that this intersection necessity is questioned. 6. **Consider a simplified counterexample:** Assume the original rectangle is subdivided into four smaller rectangles (e.g., by drawing one horizontal and one vertical line through the middle): - Let the centers of two of these smaller rectangles be (C_1) and (C_2). - If (C_1) and (C_2) are aligned in such a way that the segment connecting (C_1) and (C_2) passes between other rectangles, it is conceivable that the segment might not intersect any other rectangles, particularly in symmetric arrangements. 7. **Conclusion based on analysis and reference:** We conclude, through either transformation into a square or by specific counterexamples, that there exists at least one configuration where the segment connecting the centers of two smaller rectangles does not intersect another smaller rectangle. This shows that the statement “every such segment must intersect another rectangle” cannot be universally true.

Let ( S ) be a nonempty set of positive integers such that for any integers ( a ) and ( b ) in ( S ), the number ( ab + 1 ) is also in ( S ). 2. Consider a prime ( p ) and let ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k ) be all the distinct residues modulo ( p ) of elements in ( S ), where ( p nmid a_i ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). 3. Suppose ( a_i a_j + 1 equiv a_i a_l + 1 pmod{p} ) for some ( i, j, l ) and ( j neq l ). Then: [ a_i (a_j - a_l) equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Since ( p nmid a_i ), it follows that ( p mid (a_j - a_l) ), which is a contradiction because ( a_j ) and ( a_l ) are distinct residues modulo ( p ). 4. Therefore, ( a_i a_1 + 1, a_i a_2 + 1, ldots, a_i a_k + 1 ) are all distinct residues modulo ( p ). Since ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k ) are the residues modulo ( p ) of the elements of ( S ), the residue ( a_i a_j + 1 pmod{p} ) must also be in ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k} ). 5. This implies: [ {a_i a_1 + 1, a_i a_2 + 1, ldots, a_i a_k + 1} equiv {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k} pmod{p} ] for any ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). 6. Summing both sets modulo ( p ) gives: [ a_i (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k) + k equiv (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k) pmod{p} ] Simplifying, we get: [ (a_i - 1)(a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k) equiv -k pmod{p} ] for any ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). 7. If ( p mid (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k) ), then ( p mid -k ), implying ( k geq p ). However, since none of ( a_i )'s are divisible by ( p ), this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, ( p nmid (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k) ). 8. Thus: [ a_i - 1 equiv frac{-k}{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k} pmod{p} ] for any ( i = 1, 2, ldots, k ). 9. If ( k > 1 ), then: [ a_1 - 1 equiv frac{-k}{a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_k} equiv a_2 - 1 pmod{p} ] which is false since ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are distinct residues modulo ( p ). Therefore, ( k = 1 ). 10. This means that if ( p nmid ) any element of ( S ), then the number of possible residues of ( S ) modulo ( p ) is exactly one. 11. Since ( S ) is non-empty, let ( a in S ). We claim that all primes greater than ( a^2 - a + 1 ) divide some element in ( S ). 12. Suppose there is a prime ( p ) greater than ( a^2 - a + 1 ) which does not divide any element of ( S ). We proved that then the number of possible residues of ( S ) modulo ( p ) is exactly one, which is ( a pmod{p} ). Therefore: [ a^2 + 1 equiv a pmod{p} ] implying: [ p mid (a^2 - a + 1) ] or: [ p leq |a^2 - a + 1| ] But since ( a^2 - a + 1 = left(a - frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{3}{4} ge 0 ) and ( p > a^2 - a + 1 ), we get a contradiction. 13. Therefore, all primes greater than ( a^2 - a + 1 ) will divide at least one element of ( S ). Since ( a^2 - a + 1 ) is finite, only a finite number of primes exist which do not divide any element of ( S ).

It is well known that there are two such quadruples when ( p equiv 1 pmod{4} ), and none at all when ( p equiv 3 pmod{4} ). - If ( a = d ) and ( b neq c ), then we have ( p = a^2 + bc ), so there are ( 2N ) quadruples. - Similarly, if ( a neq d ) and ( b = c ), then we have ( 2N ) quadruples. - Finally, if ( a neq d ) and ( b neq c ), then we can permute the quadruples in eight ways: [ (a, b, c, d), (d, b, c, a), (a, c, b, d), (d, c, b, a), (b, a, d, c), (c, a, d, b), (b, d, a, c), (c, d, a, b). ] Each such permutation is distinct due to ( p ) being prime. Thus, the number of quadruples in this case is always a multiple of ( 8 ). 6. **Combine all four cases:** Combining all four cases gives the desired result: - If ( p equiv 1 pmod{4} ), then ( T equiv 4N + 2 pmod{8} ). - If ( p equiv 3 pmod{4} ), then ( T equiv 4N pmod{8} ). 7. **Explicit formula for ( T ):** [ T = 4(varphi(1) + varphi(2) + cdots + varphi(lfloor sqrt{p} rfloor)) - p - 1. ] 8. **Define the set ( S ):** Define the set [ S = {(a, b) in mathbb{Z}^2 : 0 < a, b < sqrt{p}, gcd(a, b) = 1} ] so that [ |S| = 2(varphi(1) + varphi(2) + cdots + varphi(lfloor sqrt{p} rfloor)) - 1. ] 9. **Function ( f ):** For each ((a, b) in S), we assign ( f(a, b) = ab^{-1} pmod{p} ). We need the following facts about ( f ): - ( f ) is injective: If ( f(a, b) = f(c, d) ), then ( p mid ad - bc ).

We can see that ( p mid ad + bc ) iff ( f(a, b) = -f(c, d) ), thus [ T = a_1 a_{p-1} + a_2 a_{p-2} + cdots + a_{p-1} a_1 = sum_{k=1}^{p-1} (a_k + a_{p-k} - 1) = 2|S| - (p-1). ] 11. **Conclusion:** Both claims clearly imply the problem; observe that ( varphi(n) ) is even for ( n > 2 ), hence ( T equiv -(p + 1) pmod{8} ), and the first claim finishes the proof.

Then ( x^2 = 25k^2 ). - Since ( x^2 + y^2 ) is divisible by 5, ( y^2 ) must also be divisible by 5. - Thus, let ( y = 5l ).

To prove that two convex bodies with coinciding projections onto the three coordinate planes necessarily intersect, we begin by considering the case of two convex planar figures. Assume that these convex figures have projections onto the coordinate axes that coincide. 2. To demonstrate this, consider a rectangle (ABCD) with points (K, L, M,) and (N) lying on the sides (AB, BC, CD,) and (DA), respectively. We need to show that the intersection point of the diagonals (AC) and (BD) belongs to the quadrilateral (KLMN). 3. First, observe that the diagonals of the rectangle, (AC) and (BD), intersect at the center of the rectangle. 4. Since (A, B, C,) and (D) form a rectangle, the diagonals (AC) and (BD) bisect each other. This means the intersection point (P) of (AC) and (BD) is equidistant from (A, B, C,) and (D). 5. Notice that (AC) cannot be entirely contained within the triangles (KBL) or (NDM), and (BD) cannot be completely contained within triangles (KAN) or (LCM). 6. Therefore, the intersection point (P) of the diagonals (AC) and (BD) does not belong exclusively to either of these triangles. Hence, (P) must belong to the interior of the quadrilateral (KLMN). 7. Moving onto the 3-dimensional case, consider two convex bodies whose projections onto the three coordinate planes coincide.

The distance between any vertices of different polygons is greater than (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}). We aim to prove that the polygons (F_1) and (F_2) do not have any common interior points. To do this, assume the contrary that they do have a common interior point. We consider two cases: 1. **One polygon is contained within the other**: - Assume ( F_1 ) is contained within ( F_2 ). - Let ( A ) be a vertex of ( F_1 ). - We can always find three vertices ( P, Q, R ) of ( F_2 ) such that the triangle ( triangle PQR ) contains ( A ). By the properties of a triangle, if ( A ) is inside (triangle PQR), at least one of the angles ( angle PAQ, angle QAR, angle RAP ) is greater than or equal to ( 90^circ ). For concreteness, assume ( angle PAQ geq 90^circ ). Then, by the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle or obtuse triangle: [ PQ^2 geq AP^2 + AQ^2 ] Given the constraints: [ PQ leq 1 ] we have: [ 1 geq AP^2 + AQ^2 ] Note that ( AP ) and ( AQ ) are lengths between the vertex ( A ) of ( F_1 ) and vertices ( P ) and ( Q ) of ( F_2 ), respectively. Since both distances ( AP ) and ( AQ ) must be less than (frac{1}{sqrt{2}}) to satisfy the hypothesized distance: [ AP leq frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, quad AQ leq frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ] This contradicts the premise that ( F_1) is contained within ( F_2 ). 2. **Sides of polygons intersect**: - Consider sides ( AB ) of ( F_1 ) and ( PQ ) of ( F_2 ) intersect, forming a convex quadrilateral ( APBQ ). Here, at least one of its internal angles, say ( angle PAQ ), is ( geq 90^circ ). Again, by the Pythagorean theorem: [ PQ^2 geq PA^2 + AQ^2 ] Since the distances are constrained by: [ AP leq frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, quad AQ leq frac{1}{sqrt{2}} ] Similar to the previous argument, this results in a contradiction to the given conditions of the distances being greater than ( frac{1}{sqrt{2}}).

For simplicity, consider the figures as flat shapes like polygons or other geometrical entities lying in the plane. 2. **Identifying the Necessary Movement**: - A direct movement in the plane might not suffice because reorientation often requires exiting the plane of the figures. 3. **Half Turn in Space**: - To bring these two symmetric figures into coincidence, a rotational movement is required. Specifically, a half-turn (180 degrees rotation) around a symmetry axis perpendicular to their plane should be considered. 4. **Conceptualizing the Half Turn**: - Let (O) be the point where the symmetry axes (if extended) intersect. - The rotation axis will be chosen to align with the common perpendicular to the axes of symmetry (A_1) and (A_2). 5. **Performing the Half Turn**: - Rotate one figure around this chosen axis by 180 degrees. Consequently, the figure flips, aligning with the other symmetrical figure. 6. **Result**: - After the rotation, both figures coincide perfectly. # Conclusion To bring two symmetric planar figures into coincidence, one needs to perform a half-turn (180 degrees rotation) around an axis perpendicular to their plane. This axis should be aligned with their symmetry axis in space.

When the man is rowing downstream (with the current), his effective speed will be Vm + Vr = 6 km/h + 3 km/h = 9 km/h. Let's denote the distance to the place he is rowing to as D. The time it takes to row upstream to that place is T_upstream = D / (Vm - Vr), and the time it takes to row downstream back is T_downstream = D / (Vm + Vr).

For x in left(-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right), we know that cos x > 0 and sin x geq 0. Thus, f'(x) = cos x + xsin x > 0 for all x in this interval. This implies that f(x) is monotonically increasing on left(-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right). Part (2) Given a > 0, the derivative of f(x) with respect to x is: f'(x) = 3ax^2 + cos x + xsin x. Let g(x) = 3ax^2 + cos x + xsin x. We then find the derivative of g(x): g'(x) = 6ax + xcos x = x(6a + cos x). - **Case 1:** When 6a geq 1, i.e., a geq frac{1}{6}, we have 6a + cos x > 0 for all x in (0, pi). This means g'(x) > 0 for all x in this interval, indicating that g(x), and thus f'(x), is monotonically increasing. Since f'(x) > f'(0) = 1, f'(x) has no zero points on (0, pi), leading to 0 extreme points. - **Case 2:** When 0 < 6a < 1, i.e., 0 < a < frac{1}{6}, there exists an x_0 in (0, pi) such that cos x_0 = -6a. This implies that g'(x) changes sign at x_0, being positive for 0 < x < x_0 and negative for x_0 < x < pi. This indicates one sign change zero point of f'(x) on (0, pi), leading to 1 extreme point. - **Sub-case 2a:** If 3api^2 - 1 geq 0, i.e., frac{1}{3pi^2} leq a < frac{1}{6}, then f'(x) has no zero points on (0, pi), resulting in 0 extreme points. - **Sub-case 2b:** If 3api^2 - 1 < 0, i.e., 0 < a < frac{1}{3pi^2}, then f'(x) has 1 sign change zero point on (0, pi), resulting in 1 extreme point. Conclusion - When a geq frac{1}{3pi^2}, the number of extreme points of f(x) on (0, pi) is boxed{0}. - When 0 < a < frac{1}{3pi^2}, the number of extreme points of f(x) on (0, pi) is boxed{1}."},{"prompt":"A pet store has some bird cages.

Find the locus of all such points Z.","completion":"Part (a) To determine the locus of all midpoints ( P ) of segments ( XY ) where ( X ) is any point on the diagonal ( AC ) of face ( ABCD ), and ( Y ) is any point on the diagonal ( B'D' ) of the parallel face ( A'B'C'D' ): 1. **Projection of the Midpoint:** Let ( P ) be the midpoint of ( XY ). Project ( P ) onto the plane ( L ) containing the face ( ABCD ) as ( P_1 ), and onto the parallel plane ( L' ) containing the face ( A'B'C'D' ) as ( P_2 ). 2. **Right Triangles Properties:** Consider the right triangles ( PP_1X ) and ( PP_2Y ). These triangles are congruent because they have equal angles at ( P ) (being vertical angles) and equal hypotenuses (both equal to ( frac{1}{2}XY )). Hence, ( PP_1 = PP_2 ). Therefore, ( P ) is always equidistant from ( L ) and ( L' ). 3. **Symmetry:** The fact that ( P ) is equidistant from ( L ) and ( L' ) shows that ( P ) lies on a plane ( S ) which is the mid-plane between ( L ) and ( L' ). This plane is perpendicular to the edge ( AA' ). 4. **Geometric Interpretation:** If we fix ( X ) at a point ( K ) on ( AC ) (the midpoint of ( AC )), and ( Y ) at a point ( K' ) on ( B'D' ) (the midpoint of ( B'D' )), the line segment ( KK' ) is perpendicular to both ( AC ) and ( B'D' ). Thus segments ( P_1X ) and ( P_2Y ) collapse into single points. This degenerate case reinforces that the midpoints of ( XY ) segments lie in the plane ( S ). 5. **Conclusion with Specific Movements:** - If ( X ) moves along ( AC ) and ( Y ) moves along ( B'D' ): - The midpoint ( P ) moves along the line segment ( X B'D' ) half-way parallel to ( B'D' ). - The locus of midpoints will sweep out a square-shaped region denoted as ( Q ) — the section created by translating line segments parallel to their direction while preserving symmetry. Thus, the locus of all midpoints ( P ) of ( XY ) spans the area of a square within the mid-plane ( S ) of the cube, denoted as ( Q ). **Conclusion:** [ boxed{Q} text{, which is a square in the mid-plane of the cube.} ] Part (b) To find the locus of points ( Z ) on segment ( XY ) such that ( ZY = 2XZ ): 1. **Define the Ratios and Projections:** Let ( Z_1 ) be the projection of ( Z ) onto the plane ( L ) and ( Z_2 ) be its projection onto the plane ( L' ). In triangles ( ZZ_1X ) and ( ZZ_2Y ), the sides ( ZZ_1 ) and ( ZZ_2 ) must maintain the ratio ( 1:2 ). 2. **Locate ( Z_1 ) and ( Z_2 ):** Since triangles ( ZZ_1X ) and ( ZZ_2Y ) are similar with ( ZZ_2 = 2ZZ_1 ), ( Z ) lies in a plane ( S^* ) parallel to ( L ) and ( L' ) such that ( Z_2 ) to ( Z_1 ) maintains a consistent distance ratio. 3. **Deriving ( S^* ):** ( S^* ) is divided in a proportional manner along the height of the cube. If ( L ) is divided into 3 equal segments, ( S^* ) is at a height corresponding to 1/3 from the base and 2/3 from the top. 4. **Geometric Interpretation:** The locus of ( Z ) points must be within the intersection of the mid-plane analogous to ( T ) but shifted by 1/3 along the normal plane. Thus, the locus of all such points ( Z ) forms a rectangle, parallel to the diagonal planes and encompassing proportions equal to segments: [ M_1, N_1, N_2, ] and ( M_2 ) **Conclusion:** [ boxed{M_1N_1N_2M_2} text{, which is a rectangle centered within the cube.} ]"},{"prompt":"A shopkeeper raises the price by 31% and gives successive discounts.

If player A goes first, who has a winning strategy?","completion":"The problem asks whether player A, who moves first, has a guaranteed winning strategy when playing a game on a 4000 times 2019 grid. The game consists of players taking turns removing a square sub-grid such that the remaining grid is still connected. Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Initial Move by Player A:** - Player A starts by removing a 2018 times 2018 square sub-grid from one corner of the 4000 times 2019 grid. - This leaves a remaining grid that has a left side with dimensions 2018 times 2019 and a right side with dimensions 1982 times 2019 (since 4000 - 2018 = 1982). 2. **Symmetry and Mirroring Strategy:** - Define a line of symmetry, called L, that divides the remaining grid into two mirrored parts vertically. L would essentially run through the entire height of 2019 cells at the point that divides the grid with dimensions 2018 on the left of L and 1982 on the right of L. - Whatever rectangular sub-grid player B removes, player A will always remove an equivalent mirrored rectangular sub-grid on the opposite side of L. This ensures both sides remain symmetrical. 3. **Preservation of Connectivity and Symmetry:** - Because player A’s moves are always mirroring player B’s moves, the connectivity of the grid is maintained. - For every move player B makes, player A can always respond in a manner that maintains the symmetric balance about L. 4. **Winning Strategy:** - Since player A starts the game and always mirrors player B’s moves, the game ensures that player A will always have a counter-move to any move player B makes. - By maintaining this mirroring strategy, player A can ensure that player B is forced into a position with no moves left to maintain the grid's connectivity, leading to a win for player A. Conclusion: Given the symmetry and mirroring strategy described, **player A has a guaranteed winning strategy**.

For (k = n), we have: [ a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] Since (frac{n(n+1)}{2}) must be divisible by (n), (n) must be odd (because (n) and (n+1) are consecutive integers, one of which is even, making their product even, and thus (frac{n(n+1)}{2}) is an integer). 3. Consider (k = n-1): [ a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{n-1} = frac{n(n+1)}{2} - a_n ] Since (a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_{n-1}) must be divisible by (n-1), we have: [ n-1 mid frac{n(n+1)}{2} - a_n ] Simplifying, we get: [ n-1 mid n(n+1) - 2a_n ] [ n-1 mid n^2 + n - 2a_n ] [ n-1 mid (n^2 + n - 2a_n) - (n-1)^2 ] [ n-1 mid n^2 + n - 2a_n - (n^2 - 2n + 1) ] [ n-1 mid 3n - 2a_n - 1 ] [ n-1 mid 2a_n - 2 ] Since (a_n leq n), we have (2a_n - 2 leq 2(n-1)). Therefore, (2a_n - 2) must be either (n-1) or (2(n-1)). 4. If (2a_n - 2 = n-1), then: [ 2a_n = n + 1 ] [ a_n = frac{n+1}{2} ] This implies (n) is odd. 5.

We want to prove that the perimeter and the area of the first polygon are greater than that of the second polygon. 1. **Notation:** - Let ( r ) be the radius of the circle. - Denote the central angles corresponding to the sides of the first polygon by (2alpha_1, 2alpha_2, ldots, 2alpha_k) and for the second polygon by (2beta_1, 2beta_2, ldots, 2beta_l). - For ease of notation, let (beta_{l+1} = ldots = beta_k = 0). 2. **Using the Sine Function:** - Since the polygons are inscribed in circles, it's known that: [ sin alpha_i = frac{a_i}{r} quad (i = 1, 2, ldots, k) ] and [ sin beta_j = frac{b_j}{r} quad (j = 1, 2, ldots, l) ] 3. **Sum of Central Angles:** - Given the assumptions (a_1 < b_1), (a_2 < b_2), ..., (a_l < b_l), it follows from the properties of the sine function that: [ alpha_1 + alpha_2 + ldots + alpha_i < beta_1 + beta_2 + ldots + beta_i quad text{for } i = 1, 2, ldots, k - 1 ] However, [ alpha_1 + alpha_2 + ldots + alpha_k = beta_1 + beta_2 + ldots + beta_k = pi ] since both sums of angles must equal (180^circ) or (pi) radians because they are the angles subtended by the polygons at the center of the circle. 4. **Perimeter Calculation:** - The perimeter (K_1) of the first polygon and (K_2) of the second polygon are given by: [ K_1 = 2r (sin alpha_1 + sin alpha_2 + ldots + sin alpha_k) ] [ K_2 = 2r (sin beta_1 + sin beta_2 + ldots + sin beta_l) = 2r (sin beta_1 + sin beta_2 + ldots + sin beta_k text{ where } beta_{l+1}, ldots, beta_k = 0) ] 5. **Area Calculation:** - The area (T_1) of the first polygon and (T_2) of the second polygon are given by: [ T_1 = frac{r^2}{2} (sin 2alpha_1 + sin 2alpha_2 + ldots + sin 2alpha_k) ] [ T_2 = frac{r^2}{2} (sin 2beta_1 + sin 2beta_2 + ldots + sin 2beta_l) = frac{r^2}{2} (sin 2beta_1 + sin 2beta_2 + ldots + sin 2beta_k text{ where } beta_{l+1}, ldots, beta_k = 0) ] 6. **Application of Sine Function Property:** - Since (sin x) is concave on the interval ((0, pi)) and considering all angles (alpha_i) and (beta_j) are less than (frac{pi}{2}), a suitable inequality from the theory of inequalities (e.g., Problem 387 in the referenced text) implies: [ sin alpha_1 + sin alpha_2 + ldots + sin alpha_k > sin beta_1 + sin beta_2 + ldots + sin beta_k ] and [ sin 2alpha_1 + sin 2alpha_2 + ldots + sin 2alpha_k > sin 2beta_1 + sin 2beta_2 + ldots + sin 2beta_k ] 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, the perimeter and the area of the first polygon are indeed greater than that of the second polygon.

This is a permutation of 3 items out of 3, which equals to A_{3}^{3} or 3! (3 factorial). Combining the results from the two steps using the counting principle, the total number of arrangements is the product of the two individual counts: C_{6}^{3} cdot A_{3}^{3} = frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} cdot 3! Evaluating this expression, we get: C_{6}^{3} cdot A_{3}^{3} = frac{6!}{3!3!} cdot 3! C_{6}^{3} cdot A_{3}^{3} = frac{6 cdot 5 cdot 4}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} cdot 3! C_{6}^{3} cdot A_{3}^{3} = 20 cdot 6 C_{6}^{3} cdot A_{3}^{3} = 120 However, we need to consider the arrangement of all black cars, which means we need to account for black cars in a 6 times 6 matrix rather than a 3 times 3. This requires us to calculate permutations for black cars across the whole grid after placing red ones (not just the remaining 3 cells). So, we actually have: C_{6}^{3} cdot A_{6}^{6} Calculating this, we have: C_{6}^{3} cdot A_{6}^{6} = frac{6!}{3!3!} cdot 6! C_{6}^{3} cdot A_{6}^{6} = 20 cdot 720 C_{6}^{3} cdot A_{6}^{6} = 14400 Therefore, there are boxed{14400} possible methods to park the cars according to the given conditions."},{"prompt":"The problem involves a hyperbola C: frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0).

Given that there can be at most 2015 isolated groups, prove that the company's employees can be divided into 11 departments such that there are no adversarial relationships within the same department.","completion":"1. Let G = (V, E) be a graph where V is the set of employees of the company, and E is the set of edges representing antagonistic relationships between pairs of employees. In graph theory language, dividing the company's employees into 11 subsets without antagonistic relationships means appropriately coloring all vertices in the graph with 11 different colors such that each vertex is assigned a unique color. 2. First, we'll prove a more general statement: Given a graph G where every vertex is colored with k colors (with k geq 3), the graph G contains at least 2^{k-1} - k lonely groups. 3. If coloring the vertices of graph G requires at least k colors: [ V = V_1 cup V_2 cup cdots cup V_k ] then if k geq 12, we have 2^{11} - 12 > 2015, which leads to a contradiction. This implies k leq 11. 4. Thus, our goal is to show that the graph can be colored with no more than 11 colors such that no two vertices in the same subset are antagonistic. 5. Assume the graph G is colored with k colors. Consider the lexicographically smallest colorings, denoted as (1). A lexicographically minimal coloring is one where the smallest set sizes are assigned to consecutive colors, i.e., n_1 = |V_1|, n_2 = |V_2|, dots, n_{k-1} = |V_{k-1}| in increasing order. 6. We're required to prove that no subset of these employees' groups exceeds the lonely groups' count rule. This follows by selecting any vertex v in V_1 and constructing a poly-chromatic odd cycle where v is the only vertex from V_1. The steps are as follows: - Place vertex ( v ) at the center. - Arrange sets ( V_2, V_3, ldots, V_k ) in circular order around ( v ). - Establish directed edges pointing from ( v ) to all adjacent vertices in ( V_2 ). - Mark these vertices and continue marking adjacent vertices in subsequent sets, ensuring a directed path from each marked vertex to unmarked adjacent vertices in the next subset. 7. Using the marking procedure: - If any directed path aligns vertices in ( V_2 ) back towards the initial sets, constructing cycles that pass through all color classes ( V_1, V_2, ldots, V_k ), an odd cycle is formed because the number of paths is odd. This guarantees at least one poly-chromatic odd cycle encapsulating all subset colors. 8. This demonstrates that graph G has at least 2^{k-1} - k lonely groups. 9. Applying to subsets C subseteq {1,2,ldots, k} with odd sizes greater than 1 provides diverse color combinations. Each combination forms a unique odd cycle containing multiple incompatible groups. 10. Importantly, since the graph is colored lexicographically minimally, switching a color class into the original subset without altering the minimal condition guarantees no vertices within departments conflict. 11. Conclusively, confirming the original statement holds: [ k leq 11 implies boxed{11 text{ departments can ensure without mutual antagonistic relationships.}} ] Using this comprehensive, step-by-step verification enables colouring vertices within a maximum of 11 hues efficiently maintains harmonious grouping within employee departments devoid of antagonism."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = begin{cases} x+1, & text{if } xgeq 0 f(x+2), & text{if } x<0 end{cases}, then the value of f(3) is ( ) A: 5 B: 1 C: 7 D: 2","completion":"According to the problem, f(-3) = f(-3+2) = f(-1) = f(-1+2) = f(1) = 1+1 = 2.

According to the problem, if 10 of the rooms that were rented for 60 had instead been rented for 40, the total rent would have been reduced by 50 percent. This means that the new total rent would be ( 40(R_{40} + 10) + 60(R_{60} - 10) ), and this amount is half of the original total rent. So we have the equation: [ 40(R_{40} + 10) + 60(R_{60} - 10) = frac{1}{2} (40R_{40} + 60R_{60}) ] Expanding both sides gives us: [ 40R_{40} + 400 + 60R_{60} - 600 = frac{1}{2} (40R_{40} + 60R_{60}) ] Simplifying, we get: [ 40R_{40} + 60R_{60} - 200 = frac{1}{2} (40R_{40} + 60R_{60}) ] Now, let's multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: [ 2(40R_{40} + 60R_{60} - 200) = 40R_{40} + 60R_{60} ] [ 80R_{40} + 120R_{60} - 400 = 40R_{40} + 60R_{60} ] Subtract ( 40R_{40} + 60R_{60} ) from both sides: [ 40R_{40} + 60R_{60} - 400 = 0 ] Now, add 400 to both sides: [ 40R_{40} + 60R_{60} = 400 ] This equation tells us that the difference in total rent by changing the price of 10 rooms from 60 to 40 is 400.

By the induction hypothesis, there exists a diameter ( AB ) in this ( n-1 )-gon that divides it into two arcs, each containing at least (frac{n-1}{3}) vertices. 5. **Verification**: - Suppose ( AB ) does not work for the ( n )-gon. This implies that one of the arcs ( A ldots X ldots B ) or ( A ldots Y ldots B ) has more than (frac{2}{3}(n+1)) vertices. - Consider the triangle ( triangle ABY ) in the triangulation with ( Y in A ldots X ldots B ). One of the arcs ( A ldots Y ) or ( Y ldots B ) must have at least (frac{2}{3}(n+1)/2) vertices. - Suppose ( A ldots Y ) has at least (frac{2}{3}(n+1)/2) vertices.

The options are: A: 18 B: 27 C: 20 D: 16","completion":"To find the minimum average sales of mooncakes in the first t days, we need to calculate the average sales based on the given function f(t) = t^2 + 10t + 16. The average sales in the first t days can be represented as frac{f(t)}{t} = frac{t^2 + 10t + 16}{t} = t + 10 + frac{16}{t}. To find the minimum value of this expression, we can analyze its behavior as t changes. The term frac{16}{t} decreases as t increases, which means the expression t + 10 + frac{16}{t} will have a minimum value when t is at its maximum, which is t = 30 days. Substituting t = 30 into the expression, we get frac{30^2 + 10 cdot 30 + 16}{30} = 30 + 10 + frac{16}{30} = 40 + frac{8}{15}. Since this value does not match any of the options and considering the need to find the minimum average, we need to reconsider the approach to find the exact point where the average reaches its minimum. Upon further inspection, the correct approach to find the minimum average sales involves differentiating the average sales function with respect to t and finding the critical points. However, since the detailed steps of differentiation and finding the critical points are not provided in the solution, and we are directly looking for the answer from the options given, we should focus on understanding that the minimum average sales value is sought without explicit calculation steps.

We'll focus on individual rows and clear them one by one. We consider the following operations: 1. **Removing one grain from each square of a row that has exactly one grain of wheat on each square.** 2. **Removing one grain from each square of a row that has more than one grain of wheat per square.** 3. **Doubling the number of grains in a column containing a square with exactly one grain, if not all squares in the row have one grain.** Steps: 1. **Initialization:** Consider any non-empty row we aim to clear. 2. **Checking conditions:** For each chosen row, one of the following cases applies: - All squares in the row have exactly one grain. - All squares have more than one grain. - Some squares have one grain, others have more (or fewer). 3. **Applying Operations:** - If all squares have exactly one grain, apply operation (1) to this row. Now, all squares in the row will be empty. - If all squares have more than one grain, apply operation (2) to this row. Continue applying until all squares either remain with one grain or become empty. - If some squares have exactly one grain but not uniformly across the row, use operation (3) for columns that contain squares with only one grain. This doubles the number of grains in these columns. 4. **Decreasing the number of grains:** - The number of grains in a row generally decreases with each valid operation: - For operations (1) and (2), the total grains decrease by 8. - For operation (3), the total grains decrease by at least 1 each time until some set of grains reach 8, wherein operation (1) can be applied again. These operations ensure that the number of grains in rows consistently decreases. 5. **Invariant Maintenance:** - Once a row is cleared, it remains clear since subsequent operations on other rows do not place grains back into already-cleared rows (operations (2) and (3) do not generate new non-empty squares, hence the row remains empty after being cleared). 6. **Iterative Process:** - We repeat the process for each row individually. Once a row is clear, we move on to the next row until all rows are cleared.

Additionally, we need to determine if the converse is true. 2. **Angle Relations due to Perpendicularity:** Let's analyze the geometric properties stemming from the orthocenter and triangle reflection: [ angle CAH = angle HBC ] This equality holds due to the perpendicularity of the respective sides to the altitudes intersecting at the orthocenter H. 3. **Symmetry with Respect to Side CB:** The reflection of H over CB places A' such that: [ angle CBA' = angle HBC ] Thus, A' lies on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. 4. **Extensions to Other Vertices:** Similarly, reflections over the other sides place reflections B' and C' also on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. 5. **Using the Law of Sines:** Utilizing the Law of Sines for both triangles ABC and A'B'C': [ a = 2R sin alpha ] where a is the side opposite angle alpha, and R is the circumradius. Since both triangles share the same circumcircle, they share the same circumradius R. Therefore, if two angles in triangles ABC and A'B'C' are equal, the corresponding sides opposite these angles must be equal as well. 6. **Conclusion for the Primary Statement:** Consequently, if triangles ABC and A'B'C' share an angle, they must share a side due to the shared circumcircle and corresponding relationship given by the Law of Sines. [ boxed{text{The primary statement is true.}} ] 7. **Investigating the Converse Statement:** To show the converse (that sharing a side implies sharing an angle), we analyze the angles of both triangles: By reflecting the orthocenter, the triangle A'B'C' need not be acute-angled. If A'B'C' has an angle 180^circ - 2alpha, then looking at the angle measures, we observe: [ 180^circ - 2alpha, 180^circ - 2beta, 180^circ - 2gamma ] For example, let ABC have an angle measure alpha = 40^circ, beta = 60^circ, and gamma = 80^circ. Then, the angles of A'B'C' will be: [ 100^circ, 120^circ, 140^circ. ] Clearly, even though they share side lengths due to the Law of Sines, their corresponding angles do not match one-to-one as an acute angle cannot map directly to a corresponding obtuse angle in the original setup.

This diagonal's elements are among the very first few numbers in the natural number sequence, thus being smaller than most. 4. **Proof by Comparison:** - Select any element along the diagonal that starts from the top-left corner. - Due to how the spiral fills natural numbers, each successive element along this diagonal will be relatively small. Specifically, if matrix position ((i,i)) belongs to this diagonal, the corresponding value is one of the smallest available at that stage of the filling. 5. **General Element Selection:** Suppose one tries selecting ( n ) elements such that each is from different rows and columns but not strictly from the described diagonal: - These numbers will be generally higher due to their positions in the later loops of the spiral fill pattern. - Therefore, the sum of such numbers will inherently be greater than the initial diagonal set. 6. **Summation Verification:** Let’s denote the sum of the diagonal elements from the matrix as: [ sum_{i=1}^n f(i,i) ] where ( f(i, i) ) represents the matrix element at position ((i, i)). 7. **Conclusion:** Since the initial diagonal elements as described capture the smallest available numbers under the constraint of occupying different rows and columns, their sum will be minimal compared to any other such combination.

Since AM is perpendicular to the x-axis at point M, we have M(x_0, 0). Let the equation of circle C_1 be x^2 + y^2 = r^2. According to the problem, r = frac{|3sqrt{5}|}{sqrt{1+4}} = 3. Therefore, the equation of circle C_1 is x^2 + y^2 = 9. By the given condition, overrightarrow{ON} = frac{2}{3}overrightarrow{OA} + (frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} - frac{2}{3})overrightarrow{OM}, we have (x, y) = frac{2}{3}(x_0, y_0) + (frac{2sqrt{2}}{3} - frac{2}{3})(x_0, 0).

In order for line l to intersect with ellipse C at two distinct points, the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be positive, i.e., triangle = 64k^2 - 8m^2 + 32 > 0. Since overrightarrow{OA} perp overrightarrow{OB}, we have overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB} = 0. This implies x_1x_2 + (kx_1 + m)(kx_2 + m) = 0. Simplifying this expression yields (k^2 + 1)x_1x_2 + km(x_1 + x_2) + m^2 = 0. Substituting the values of x_1 + x_2 and x_1x_2 back into this equation, we obtain 3m^2 = 8k^2 + 8.

Further simplification gives: f'(x) = frac{1 - (1+ln(x+1))}{x^2}. Finally, we get: f'(x) = - frac{ln(x+1)}{x^2}.

Since g'(x) < 0, g(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty). Given that g(1) = 1 - ln 2 < 0, and observing the change of sign of g(x) at points g(2) = 1 - ln 3 < 0 and g(3) = 2 - 2ln 2 > 0, we infer that there exists a unique real root a in (2, 3) such that g(a) = 0 or a - 1 - ln(a+1) = 0. It follows that for x in (0, a), g(x) < 0 and for x in (a, +infty), g(x) > 0.

For a hyperbola centered at the origin, the relationship between its semi-major axis a, semi-minor axis b, and the distance to the focus c is given by the equation c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Additionally, the eccentricity e is defined as e = frac{c}{a}. Given c = 2sqrt{5} and e = sqrt{5}, we can solve for a and b: 1. From e = frac{c}{a} = sqrt{5}, we find a = frac{c}{sqrt{5}} = frac{2sqrt{5}}{sqrt{5}} = 2. 2. Substituting a = 2 and c = 2sqrt{5} into c^2 = a^2 + b^2, we get (2sqrt{5})^2 = 2^2 + b^2, which simplifies to 20 = 4 + b^2. 3. Solving for b^2, we find b^2 = 16, so b = 4.

Solving this quadratic equation, we find that the discriminant Delta = 256m^2 + 192 > 0 and 4m^2 - 1 neq 0. This ensures that the line intersects the hyperbola at two points as required. 3.

Therefore, on average, one person infects 8 people in each round of infection. [boxed{x = 8}] Part 2: Total Number of People Infected After Three Rounds To find out how many people will have the flu after three rounds of infection, we use the average number of people one person infects (x = 8) and the total number of people infected after two rounds (81 people). In the third round, each of the 81 people will infect 8 more people, so the total number of new infections in the third round is 81 times 8. Adding this to the existing total gives us the total number of people infected after three rounds: [81 times 8 + 81 = 648 + 81 = 729] Therefore, after three rounds of infection, a total of 729 people will have the flu.

A point ( Q ) is taken on the segment ( XY ), and a perpendicular is erected to ( OQ ) at point ( O ). We need to find the locus of points ( P ) on this perpendicular such that the ratio ( frac{OP}{OQ} = lambda ). 2. **Case ( lambda = 1 ):** - If ( lambda = 1 ), it means ( OP = OQ ). - This implies that ( P ) is such that the segment ( OQ ) can be rotated around ( O ) by ( 90^circ ) to obtain the location of ( P ). - Since rotation by ( 90^circ ) can be done in either direction (clockwise and counterclockwise), we have two possible positions for ( P ). - Therefore, if we perform the ( 90^circ ) rotations on every point ( Q ) along the segment ( XY ), we obtain two identical segments ( X'Y' ) and ( X''Y'' ) that are the rotated versions of ( XY ) around ( O ). 3. **General Case ( lambda neq 1 ):** - For ( lambda neq 1 ), the ratio ( frac{OP}{OQ} = lambda ) implies that ( P ) is scaled along the line perpendicular to ( OQ ), originating from ( O ). - If ( lambda > 1 ), points ( P ) will be located farther from ( O ) than ( Q ). Conversely, if ( lambda < 1 ), points ( P ) will be located closer to ( O ) than ( Q ). - This scaling can be viewed as a transformation that combines rotation and scaling with ( O ) being both the center of rotation and scaling. - As ( Q ) traverses the segment ( XY ), ( P ) will describe a new segment. Since we have ( 90^circ ) rotations and the scaling by ( lambda ), we get similarly rotated and scaled segments ( X'Y' ) and ( X''Y'' ). 4. **Transformation Description:** - This transformation (combining rotation and scaling) is called a similarity transformation or homothety. - In this transformation, every point on the original segment ( XY ) is uniquely mapped to a point on another segment, maintaining the geometry of the original segment but changing its size and orientation depending on ( lambda ). # Conclusion: The locus of points ( P ), when ( Q ) runs through the entire segment ( XY ), forms segments that are geometrically similar to the original segment ( XY ).

Half of Linda's distance is 2 miles. Since Tom jogs at a rate of 9 miles per hour, the time it takes him to cover 2 miles is: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 2 miles / 9 miles per hour Time = 2/9 hours To convert this time to minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Time in minutes = (2/9) * 60 Time in minutes = 120/9 Time in minutes = 13.33 minutes (approximately) Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Tom to cover twice the distance Linda has covered.

In this scenario, she would have an equal number of pennies and nickels, so: [ p = n + 2 ] 2. **Solve the equations**: Substitute p = n + 2 into p + n = 15: [ (n + 2) + n = 15 implies 2n + 2 = 15 implies 2n = 13 implies n = 6.5 ] Since the number of nickels (n) must be a whole number, we adjust our scenario.

We then conjure the equation to express (p - q) directly: [ p - q = frac{left(frac{1}{b} - frac{1}{e}right) overline{x}}{left(frac{1}{ab} - frac{1}{de}right)left(frac{1}{bc} - frac{1}{ef}right)} = -abcdef frac{(b-e) overline{x}}{(ab - de)(bc - ef)} ] 5. Thus, we have the proportional expression: [ frac{p-q}{overline{p} - overline{q}} = -frac{abcdef overline{x}}{x} ] 6. By cyclic permutation and similar calculations for other points, we find: [ frac{q-r}{overline{q} - overline{r}} = -frac{abcdef left(-overline{x}right)}{-x} = -frac{abcdef overline{x}}{x} ] 7. This indicates that: [ frac{p-q}{overline{p} - overline{q}} = frac{q-r}{overline{q} - overline{r}} ] 8. Thus, it's evident that: [ frac{p-q}{overline{q} - overline{r}} in mathbb{R} ] 9.

First, let's convert the speeds from km/h to m/s to be consistent with the lengths and distances given in meters: - Train A's speed: 42 km/h = 42 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 11.67 m/s - Train B's speed: 30 km/h = 30 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 8.33 m/s - Train C's speed: 48 km/h = 48 * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 13.33 m/s Now, let's consider the relative speeds of the trains as they approach each other: - The relative speed of Train A and Train B: 11.67 m/s + 8.33 m/s = 20 m/s - The relative speed of Train B and Train C: 8.33 m/s + 13.33 m/s = 21.66 m/s - The relative speed of Train C and Train A: 13.33 m/s + 11.67 m/s = 25 m/s Since the trains are on parallel tracks, we need to consider the distances they need to cover to clear each other. The total distance to be covered is the sum of the lengths of the trains and the distances between their tracks: - Distance for Train A and Train B to clear each other: 160 m + 320 m + 200 m = 680 m - Distance for Train B and Train C to clear each other: 320 m + 480 m + 300 m = 1100 m - Distance for Train C and Train A to clear each other: 480 m + 160 m + 500 m (200 m + 300 m) = 1140 m Now, we calculate the time it takes for each pair of trains to clear each other: - Time for Train A and Train B: 680 m / 20 m/s = 34 seconds - Time for Train B and Train C: 1100 m / 21.66 m/s = 50.78 seconds - Time for Train C and Train A: 1140 m / 25 m/s = 45.6 seconds The longest time taken by any pair of trains to clear each other will be the time when all trains are clear of each other.

The total number of students from all sets is ( x + 50 + 60 ). The total number of students who passed from all sets is ( x + 45 + 48 ). The overall pass percentage is given as 88.66666666666667%, which we can also write as ( frac{266}{3} % ). The pass percentage is calculated as the number of students who passed divided by the total number of students, all multiplied by 100.

Prove that for a given initial state, any sequence of moves that follows the rules will terminate after the same number of steps and result in the same final state.","completion":"# Problem: Place a finite number of beans in an infinite bi-directional grid. The movement series is defined as follows: in each step, choose a square with at least two beans in it, remove two beans from it, place one bean in the square to its left neighbor, and one bean in the square to its right neighbor. The sequence stops when every square has at most one bean. Prove that for any initial state, any movement sequence that follows the rules will end after the same number of steps and will reach the same final state. 1. **Step 1: Proving Movement Sequence Must Terminate** To prove that the movement sequence must terminate, assume that there exists an initial state with (n) beans that leads to an infinite movement sequence. Label the squares with beans from left to right starting from 0, 1, 2, ..., and to the left with -1, -2, ....

Define (L) as the length of the longest sequence of consecutive empty squares in the initial state: [ L geqslant 0 ] Regardless of movements, the length of the longest sequence of consecutive empty squares does not exceed (A = max{L, 1}). Therefore, for any (k in mathbb{N}), [ M_k - m_k leqslant (n-1)(A+1) ] 2. **Step 2: Defining the Functions f(k) and g(k)** Define the functions: [ f(k) = sum_{l=-infty}^{+infty} l a_{kl}, quad g(k) = sum_{l=-infty}^{+infty} l^2 a_{kl} ] Here, (a_{kl}) represents the number of beans at position (l) before the (k)-th move.

Further, [ m_k n = m_k sum_{l=-infty}^{+infty} a_{kl} leqslant f(k) leqslant M_k sum_{l=-infty}^{+infty} a_{kl} = M_k n ] Hence, [ m_k n leqslant C leqslant M_k n ] 3. **Step 3: Establishing Bounds** From the above inequalities: [ m_k + (n-1)(A+1) geqslant M_k geqslant frac{C}{n} ] [ m_k geqslant left[ frac{C}{n} - (n-1)(A+1) right] ] [ M_k - (n-1)(A+1) leqslant M_k leqslant frac{C}{n} ] [ M_k leqslant left[ frac{C}{n} - (n-1)(A+1) right] ] This states that the indices of squares with beans neither go below (left[ frac{C}{n} - (n-1)(A+1) right]) nor exceed (left[ frac{C}{n} + (n-1)(A+1) right]). 4. **Step 4: Monotonicity of g(k)** Considering, [ g(k) = sum_{l=-infty}^{+infty} l^2 a_{kl} leqslant B^2, B = max left{ left| left[ frac{C}{n} - (n-1)(A+1) right] right|, frac{C}{n} + (n-1)(A+1) right}, sum_{l=-infty}^{+infty} a_{kl} leqslant B^2 n ] Knowing, [ (a+1)^2 + (a-1)^2 - 2a^2 = 2 quad text{yields} quad g(k+1) - g(k) = 2, k=1, 2, ldots ] 5. **Step 5: Proof by Contradiction** Assume: [ g(k) = 2(k-1) + g(1) Rightarrow k = 1, 2, ldots Rightarrow g(k_0) > B^2 n ] Contradiction follows, asserting the sequence terminates. 6. **Step 6: Unique and Identical Termination State** Consider sequences composed of consecutive empty squares when all occupied squares resolve into single beans, terminated uniquely. The unique final state: [ 0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + (n-1) ] which holds as the motion series converges to unique sums. As (f(k) equiv C), the result concludes uniquely. 7. **Conclusion** Any initial state, any movement sequence, ends after the same number of steps, reaching the same final state.

Each parallelepiped is aligned to one of the faces of the cube in such a way that the center of the parallelepiped's face coincides with the center of the corresponding cube face (seen in Figure 69). 2. **Symmetry and Obstruction:** The pencils are arranged so that each pair of parallel pencils obstructs the vertices of the other parallel pair along a specific axis. Since these pencils are thin and long, and they are symmetrically placed relative to the cube's center, looking from the center of the cube, one will not be able to see the vertices of these pencils. 3. **Verifying the Visibility:** To ensure none of the new vertices created by connecting these pencils will be visible from the cube's center, imagine \\"bridges\\" or connections between the pencils. These will create new vertices, but these vertices will remain close to the pre-existing vertices of the pencils which are already hidden. 4. **Constructing the Pencils and Bridges:** Each pair of parallel pencils lies along one of the coordinate axes and blocks the view towards their corresponding vertices of the other pencils, making it so that from the cube center, none of the vertices created (old or new) can be seen. Conclusion Therefore, it is possible to construct a polyhedron such that from a point outside of it (specifically, the center of the initial cube), none of its vertices are visible.

To do this, we use the result from problem 10.36, where we choose the constants ( c_1, c_2, ldots, c_k ) such that they satisfy the initial conditions of the sequence: [ begin{aligned} u_1 &= c_1 + c_2 + cdots + c_k u_2 &= c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2 + cdots + c_k x_k & vdots u_k &= c_1 x_1^{k-1} + c_2 x_2^{k-1} + cdots + c_k x_k^{k-1} end{aligned} ] 5. We verify that the form ( u_n = c_1 x_1^{n-1} + c_2 x_2^{n-1} + cdots + c_k x_k^{n-1} ) satisfies the recurrence relation. Consider ( u_{k+1} ): [ u_{k+1} = c_1 x_1^k + c_2 x_2^k + cdots + c_k x_k^k ] 6. Using the characteristic polynomial, we substitute ( x_i^k ) with ( a_1 x_i^{k-1} + a_2 x_i^{k-2} + cdots + a_k ): [ begin{aligned} u_{k+1} &= c_1 (a_1 x_1^{k-1} + a_2 x_1^{k-2} + cdots + a_k) + c_2 (a_1 x_2^{k-1} + a_2 x_2^{k-2} + cdots + a_k) + cdots + c_k (a_1 x_k^{k-1} + a_2 x_k^{k-2} + cdots + a_k) &= a_1 (c_1 x_1^{k-1} + c_2 x_2^{k-1} + cdots + c_k x_k^{k-1}) + a_2 (c_1 x_1^{k-2} + c_2 x_2^{k-2} + cdots + c_k x_k^{k-2}) + cdots + a_k (c_1 + c_2 + cdots + c_k) &= a_1 u_k + a_2 u_{k-1} + cdots + a_k u_1 end{aligned} ] 7. Therefore, by substituting the general form into the recurrence relation, we find that it holds true, satisfying the condition given in the problem. 8. Similarly, a continued application of the characteristic polynomial for higher indices ( u_{k+2}, u_{k+3}, ldots ) can be verified in a similar manner, confirming the form of the solution for all ( n ).

If ( G ) were not connected, then the total balance of a connected component would be fixed under pushes, contradicting the ability to redistribute money arbitrarily. 3. **Cycle-Free Graph**: We need to show that ( G ) does not contain any cycles. If ( G ) is cycle-free, it is a tree, which implies it has ( 2011 - 1 = 2010 ) edges. 4. **Contradiction with Cycles**: Assume for contradiction that ( G ) contains a cycle. Consider the cycle of minimal length ( v_1v_2 cdots v_k ) for ( k geq 3 ). We will show that it is impossible to reach a state where ( v_1 ) has a balance of (-1), ( v_2 ) has a balance of (1), and everyone else has a balance of (0) starting from an initial state where everyone has a balance of (0). 5. **Pushes and Balances**: Suppose it is possible to reach the desired state with ( v_1 ) pushing ( a_1 ) times, ( v_2 ) pushing ( a_2 ) times, and so on, up to ( v_{2011} ) pushing ( a_{2011} ) times. Notice that if everyone pushes once, the net effect is zero. Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that not all ( a_i )'s are positive (else subtract 1 from all of them). 6. **Non-zero Pushes**: Clearly, ( a_1 > 0 ) because if ( a_1 = 0 ), ( v_1 ) could not end up with a negative balance. If ( a_i = 0 ) for ( 1 < i leq k ), then ( a_{i+1} = 0 ) as well (where ( i+1 ) is taken modulo ( k )). This is because otherwise, ( v_i ) would end up with a positive balance. Therefore, if ( a_i = 0 ) for some ( 1 < i leq k ), then ( a_i = 0 Rightarrow a_{i+1} = 0 Rightarrow cdots Rightarrow a_k = 0 Rightarrow a_1 = 0 ), which is a contradiction. Hence, ( a_i > 0 ) for all ( 1 leq i leq k ). 7. **Zero Pushes Outside the Cycle**: Let ( m ) be an index with ( a_m = 0 ) and ( m > k ), as guaranteed by our earlier assumption that not all ( a_i )'s are positive. Then, all neighbors of ( v_m ) would also have to never push, since otherwise ( v_m ) would end up with a positive net worth. Applying similar logic to the neighbors of ( v_m ), and then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, we would eventually end up with some vertex on the cycle which never pushes. This contradicts our earlier result that ( a_i > 0 ) for all ( 1 leq i leq k ). 8. **Conclusion**: Our assumption that there was a cycle is incorrect.

This can be done by: [ z = 8 - ((x + y) mod 8), text{ if } (x + y) mod 8 neq 0 ] [ z = 0, text{ if } (x + y) mod 8 = 0 ] 3. **Transformation to Cylinder:** - When transforming the chessboard into a cylindrical shape by joining columns vertically, all the three-digit numbers (xyz) must still ensure no queens attack each other. - On the standard chessboard, a queen attacks another if they share the same row, column, or diagonal. - On a cylinder, the rows and columns remain continuous, but due to wrapping, diagonals may become continuous as well. 4. **Consistency in Attacks:** - Any valid placement of queens on an 8x8 chessboard necessarily ensures distinct rows ((y)), columns ((x)), and diagonals (represented by (z)). This implies that (z) values must be distinct for any non-attacking queen configuration. 5. **Sum Argument:** - Each of the digits (x, y, z) must be distinct across all 8 squares. - Summing these distinct values: [ sum_{x=1}^{8} x + sum_{y=1}^{8} y + sum_{z=1}^{8} z = (1 + 2 + cdots + 8) + (1 + 2 + cdots + 8) + (1 + 2 + cdots + 8) = 3 times 36 = 108 ] 6. **Modulo Condition:** - For the sums to be divisible by 8 (since each (xyz) three-digit sum modulo (8) should be zero): [ 108 notequiv 0 mod 8 ] - Since 108 is not a multiple of 8, this implies that it is impossible to distribute queens in such a way that their sums of coordinates satisfy the divisibility condition and therefore, some queen must attack another. # Conclusion: Given the above reasoning, it is demonstrated that the eight-queen problem on a cylindrical chessboard induces unavoidable queen interactions due to sum arguments and modular conditions.

Prove that for any such filled grid, the sum of all its basic terms is always divisible by 4 (i.e., it can always be expressed in the form 4k where k in mathbb{Z}). (China High School Mathematics Competition, 1989)","completion":"Let's re-examine the problem: Given an ( n times n ) grid (with ( n geq 4 )), where each cell contains either ( +1 ) or ( -1 ). We need to prove that the sum of the products of numbers in ( n ) unique rows and unique columns (basic items) is always divisible by 4. Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Define the Problem:** Each grid cell at position ((i, j)) is denoted as ( a_{ij} ), where ( a_{ij} in {1, -1} ). 2. **Calculate the Number of Basic Items:** Each basic item is defined as the product of ( n ) numbers, one from each row and each column. There are ( n! ) such basic items since there are ( n! ) permutations of the rows and columns. 3. **Introduce the Sum of Basic Items:** Let ( S ) be the sum of all the basic items. We need to show ( S ) is a multiple of 4. 4. **Properties of ( a_{ij} ):** Recall that each ( a_{ij} ) can be either ( +1 ) or ( -1 ). Changing ( a_{ij} ) from ( +1 ) to ( -1 ) (or vice versa) affects each product it partakes in. Specifically, it is involved in ( (n-1)! ) basic items because ( (n-1)! ) permutations remain unchanged in the other positions. 5. **Impact of Changing a Cell Value:** Changing ( a_{ij} ) affects ( (n-1)! ) basic items. Given ( n geq 4 ), ( (n-1)! ) is an even number, implying that there are an even number of basic items changing sign. 6. **Argument for Multiple of 4:** If one starts with a grid where all cells are ( +1 ), each basic item is ( 1 ), thus the sum ( S = n! ). Since ( n! ) for ( n geq 4 ) is always divisible by 4, ( S ) is divisible by 4. For any possible grid configuration, the effect of changing one ( a_{ij} ) results in adding or subtracting ( 2(k) ) to/from the sum ( S ), where ( 2k ) is the number of changes (and ( k ) is an integer). Any such change still maintains ( S ) as a multiple of 4. 7. **Summarize Changes in Basic Items:** - **( n! ) Basic Items:** The sum ( S ) for any grid configuration can only change by multiples of 4 when any ( a_{ij} ) value flips. - **Proof by Initial Configuration and Induction:** Starting from ( +1 ) and considering each change, the sum ( S ) in every configuration must inherently be another multiple of 4 since ( 4k ) changes maintaining the divisibility by 4. 8. **Final Expression:** Let us formally write this using expressions: - Initial grid with all ( +1 ): ( S = n! ) (divisible by 4) - Sum ( S ) after ( k ) transformations: [ S = n! + 2k Rightarrow 4 | (n! + 2k) ] Since ( 4 | n! ) for ( n geq 4 ), it follows that ( 4 | (n! + 2k) ). Conclusion: Thus, no matter how the ( n times n ) board is filled with ( +1 ) and ( -1 ), the sum ( S ) of the products of ( n! ) basic items is always divisible by 4.

Instead, suppose it intersects the parabola at another point M neq X. Consequently, we should have: [ FM = MH ] However, this would imply that for the point M, another projection H' on the directrix satisfies: [ FM = MH' neq MH ] This is a contradiction since it violates the fundamental property of parabolas (every point on the parabola is equidistant from the focus and the directrix). 5. **Conclusion of Angle Equality** Therefore, the angle bisector must indeed coincide with the tangent at point X. This implies that the angle of incidence of the incoming parallel ray (parallel to the axis) is equal to the angle formed between the tangent at X and the line segment XF. 6. **Reflection Property** Using the reflection property of the parabola, which ensures that an incoming ray parallel to the axis is reflected through the focus, we conclude that: [ text{All rays parallel to the axis, after reflecting off the parabola, will pass through the focus } F. ] Thus, it is demonstrated that a bundle of parallel rays converges at the focus after reflection, which is as required. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Each corner cube of size 1.5text{ cm} times 1.5text{ cm} times 1.5text{ cm} is removed from a 4text{ cm} times 4text{ cm} times 4text{ cm} cube.

Consider the scenario where ( n < frac{3^m - 1}{2} ): - If ( n = frac{3^m - 1}{2} ), the weights ( {1, 3, 9, ldots, 3^{m-1}} ) are efficiency and minimal because altering any weight would disrupt the balance achieved by ( 3^m ) configurations. Thus, this composition is unique. - Conversely, if ( frac{3^m - 1}{2} < n < frac{3^{m+1} - 1}{2} ), there could be flexibility in selecting weights. For instance, ( {1, 3, 3^2, ldots, 3^{m-1}, 3^m} ) and ( {1, 3, 3^2, ldots, 3^{m-1}, 3^m - 1} ) might both be usable.

No combination of two squares exists to sum to 19. 2. 8^2 = 64, thus 100 - 64 = 36 = 6^2. Thus, 8^2 + 6^2 + 0^2 but this involves a 0 square which isn't valid as per the problem's terms for positive squares. 3. 7^2 = 49, thus 100 - 49 = 51.

Since the given ellipse C: frac{y^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac{x^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > b > 0) has an eccentricity of frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we have frac{c}{a}=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, which implies c=1. Also, we know that a^2 = b^2 + c^2, so b=1. The line l with slope k(k neq 0) passes through the upper focus of the ellipse, which means that the focus is on the y-axis. Thus, the standard equation of the ellipse is frac{y^{2}}{2}+x^{2}=1. (2) The equation of the line l is y = kx + 1. Solving the system of equations begin{cases} y = kx + 1 frac{y^{2}}{2}+x^{2}=1 end{cases} yields (k^{2}+2)x^{2}+2kx-1=0. The discriminant of this quadratic equation is Delta = 8k^{2} + 8 > 0, which means that the equation always has two real roots. Let P(x_1, y_1) and Q(x_2, y_2) be the intersection points of line l and the ellipse. Then, we have x_1 + x_2 = frac{-2k}{k^{2}+2}, and x_1 x_2 = -frac{1}{k^{2}+2}. This implies that y_1 + y_2 = k(x_1 + x_2) + 2 = frac{4}{k^{2}+2}. Let N be the midpoint of segment PQ, then the coordinates of point N are (frac{-k}{k^{2}+2}, frac{2}{k^{2}+2}). The equation of the perpendicular bisector of segment PQ is y = frac{2}{k^{2}+2} - frac{1}{k}(x + frac{k}{k^{2}+2}). Setting x = 0, we obtain m = frac{1}{k^{2}+2} from the problem statement. Since k neq 0, we have k^{2}+2 > 2, which implies 0 < frac{1}{k^{2}+2} < frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the range of values for m is 0 < m < frac{1}{2}. (3) Let F be the focus of the ellipse.

We know that |x_1 - x_2| = sqrt{(x_1 + x_2)^{2}-4x_1x_2} = sqrt{frac{8(k^{2}+1)}{(k^{2}+2)^{2}}}. From m = frac{1}{k^{2}+2}, we have k^{2}+2 = frac{1}{m}. Thus, |x_1 - x_2| = sqrt{frac{8(frac{1}{m}-1)}{frac{1}{m^{2}}}} = sqrt{8m(1-m)}. Also, we know that |FM|=1-m. Therefore, S_{Delta MPQ} = frac{1}{2}(1-m)sqrt{8m(1-m)} = sqrt{2m(1-m)^{3}}.

We are given that the percent increase in area is approximately 44%, which means: ( A_{large} = A_{medium} + 0.44 cdot A_{medium} ) ( A_{large} = 1.44 cdot A_{medium} ) Substituting the area formulas, we get: ( pi R^2 = 1.44 cdot pi r^2 ) Since ( pi ) is a common factor, we can cancel it out: ( R^2 = 1.44 cdot r^2 ) Taking the square root of both sides to solve for ( R ): ( R = sqrt{1.44} cdot r ) ( R = 1.2 cdot r ) So the radius of the large pizza is 120% of the radius of the medium pizza. To find the percent increase in radius, we subtract 100% (the original size): ( 120% - 100% = 20% ) Therefore, the percent increase in radius from a medium to a large pizza is boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"The numerator of a simplified fraction was cubed, and the denominator was increased by 3.

Let the fraction be denoted by (frac{a}{b}), where (a) and (b) are natural numbers. 2. According to the problem, the numerator is cubed, and the denominator is increased by 3. This transformation leads to the new fraction (frac{a^3}{b+3}). 3. It is given that the new fraction is twice the original fraction: [ frac{a^3}{b+3} = 2 cdot frac{a}{b} ] 4. Equating the fractions, we have: [ frac{a^3}{b+3} = frac{2a}{b} ] 5. Cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominators: [ a^3 cdot b = 2a cdot (b+3) ] 6. Simplifying this equation: [ a^3 b = 2ab + 6a ] 7. Assuming (a neq 0), we divide both sides of the equation by (a): [ a^2 b = 2b + 6 ] 8. Rearranging the equation to isolate (a^2): [ a^2 = frac{2b + 6}{b} ] 9. Simplifying the right-hand side: [ a^2 = 2 + frac{6}{b} ] 10. In order for (a^2) to be an integer, (frac{6}{b}) must also be an integer, meaning (b) must be a divisor of 6. The possible values for (b) are therefore 1, 2, 3, and 6. 11. We evaluate each possible (b) to check if (a) is a natural number: - For (b = 1): [ a^2 = 2 + frac{6}{1} = 2 + 6 = 8 quad (a text{ would be } sqrt{8}, text{ not an integer}) ] - For (b = 2): [ a^2 = 2 + frac{6}{2} = 2 + 3 = 5 quad (a text{ would be } sqrt{5}, text{ not an integer}) ] - For (b = 3): [ a^2 = 2 + frac{6}{3} = 2 + 2 = 4 quad (a = sqrt{4} = 2, text{ an integer}) ] - For (b = 6): [ a^2 = 2 + frac{6}{6} = 2 + 1 = 3 quad (a text{ would be } sqrt{3}, text{ not an integer}) ] 12.

However, when a+b is an even number, it does not necessarily mean that both a and b are even numbers. Therefore, the statement that a+b is an even number implies both a and b are even numbers is a false statement. Thus, \\"Both a and b are even numbers\\" is a sufficient but not necessary condition for \\"a+b is an even number.\\" So, the answer is: sufficient but not necessary. This question examines the definition of sufficient and necessary conditions. First, determine the truth of p Rightarrow q and q Rightarrow p, then conclude based on the definition of sufficient and necessary conditions. From the fact that both a and b are even numbers, we can deduce that a+b is an even number. However, from a+b being an even number, it does not necessarily follow that both a and b are even numbers. The conclusion is not difficult to reach based on the definition. The method to judge sufficient and necessary conditions is: 1.
