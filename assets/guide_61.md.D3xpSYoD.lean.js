These polyhedra include the five Platonic solids, each with identical faces and vertices distributed symmetrically. Denote one of its faces as ( F ) with centroid ( C_F ). 2. The crucial property of regular polyhedra is that they possess **symmetry axes through their center ( O )**, specifically, each axis passes through ( O ) and a vertex ( V ). 3. When we rotate the polyhedron around such an axis by **( frac{2pi}{m} )**, where ( m ) is the number of faces meeting at ( V ), the vertices and their adjacent faces align perfectly with one another. 4. Each face ( F ) of the regular polyhedron is a regular ( n )-gon, where ( n ) is the number of edges (and vertices) of the face. Thus, rotating around the symmetry axis involves mapping face centers to other face centers. 5. Due to the rotational symmetry of the polyhedron, the centroids ( C ) of faces must also align in a symmetric manner. Specifically, these centroids can be connected to form another polyhedron. 6. The polyhedron formed by connecting these face centroids, referred to as **dual polyhedra**, will also be regular. This newly formed regular polyhedron has vertices at the centers of the original faces and faces corresponding to the vertices of the original polyhedron. 7. This reciprocal relationship implies: the centers of faces of a regular polyhedron serve as the vertices of its dual polyhedron, and vice versa. 8. Some notable dual pairs of regular polyhedra are: - The Cube and the Octahedron. - The Dodecahedron and the Icosahedron. - The Tetrahedron, which is self-dual, meaning its dual is another tetrahedron. # Conclusion: Therefore, the centers of the faces of any regular polyhedron indeed form the vertices of another regular polyhedron. This principle exemplifies the concept of **duality in polyhedra**. Specifically, the centers of the faces of the second polyhedron correspond to the vertices of a third polyhedron that is geometrically similar (homothetic) to the original.

The total number of turtles is the sum of Kristen's, Kris's, and Trey's turtles, which is given as 30.

The slope of the tangent to the curve at (x_0, y_0), which is given by the derivative f'(x) at x_0, must equal the slope of the line l. This gives us the equation: [f'(x_0) = 2] Since f(x) = sin 2x, we find f'(x) = 2cos 2x. Therefore, at x_0, we have: [2cos 2x_0 = 2] 2.

The correct interpretation is that for any specific point of tangency, a would be determined by the specific x_0 that satisfies both the curve and the line being tangent, but this does not generalize to a = -2kpi. Given this analysis, when a=0, it is indeed a specific case where the line could be tangent to the curve, but there could be other values of a that also satisfy the tangency condition depending on the specific point of tangency. Therefore, \\"a=0\\" is a necessary condition for the line l to be tangent to the curve at some points, but it is not sufficient because there could be other conditions or values of a that also result in tangency. However, the conclusion that the line l being tangent to the curve y=f(x) does not imply a=0 is correct. This means that while a=0 can result in tangency, not all tangencies will occur only when a=0. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \\"line l is tangent to the curve y=f(x)\\" is a necessary but not sufficient condition for \\"a=0\\".

Since 1/3 of the employees are clerical, we can calculate this number as follows: Clerical employees = 1/3 * Total employees Clerical employees = 1/3 * 3,600 Clerical employees = 1,200 Now, if the clerical staff is reduced by 1/2, the number of clerical employees remaining would be: Remaining clerical employees = 1/2 * Initial clerical employees Remaining clerical employees = 1/2 * 1,200 Remaining clerical employees = 600 After the reduction, the total number of employees would also decrease by the number of clerical staff reduced, which is 600. So the new total number of employees would be: New total employees = Initial total employees - Reduced clerical employees New total employees = 3,600 - 600 New total employees = 3,000 Now, to find the percentage of the total number of remaining employees that are clerical, we use the following formula: Percentage of clerical employees = (Remaining clerical employees / New total employees) * 100 Percentage of clerical employees = (600 / 3,000) * 100 Percentage of clerical employees = 0.2 * 100 Percentage of clerical employees = 20% Therefore, after reducing the clerical staff by half, clerical employees would make up boxed{20%} of the total number of remaining employees."},{"prompt":"甲、乙、丙、丁 participate in sports training.

Given fleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = fleft(frac{2pi}{3}right), we substitute x in f(x) = sin(2x + varphi) to get: [ sinleft(pi + varphiright) = sinleft(frac{4pi}{3} + varphiright). ] Simplifying both sides leads to: [ -sinvarphi = -frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cosvarphi - frac{1}{2}sinvarphi, ] which simplifies to: [ tanvarphi = sqrt{3}. ] Therefore, varphi = kpi + frac{pi}{3}, where k in mathbb{Z}. Thus, the values of omega and varphi are boxed{omega = 2} and boxed{varphi = kpi + frac{pi}{3}}. Part 2: Range of f(x) on the interval [-frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{6}] 1. From part (1), varphi = kpi + frac{pi}{3}. Since |varphi| < frac{pi}{2}, we have varphi = frac{pi}{3}. 2. With varphi = frac{pi}{3}, f(x) = sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}). For -frac{pi}{3} leq x leq frac{pi}{6}, we find the range of 2x + frac{pi}{3}: [ -frac{pi}{3} leq 2x + frac{pi}{3} leq frac{2pi}{3}. ] This implies the range of sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) is: [ -frac{sqrt{3}}{2} leq sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}) leq 1. ] Therefore, the range of f(x) on the interval [-frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{6}] is boxed{[-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, 1]}."},{"prompt":"(1) Solve the equation: 3left(x2right)left(12xright)=3.

The hyperbola C_2 has the equation frac{{x}^{2}}{4}-y^{2}=1, which means its semi-major axis is 2, implying a=2 for the ellipse since they share vertices. The foci of C_2 are located at (pmsqrt{5},0) because the distance from the center to a focus is sqrt{a^2+b^2}=sqrt{4+1}=sqrt{5}. The equation of the asymptotes of C_2 is y=pmfrac{1}{2}x, derived from the standard form of a hyperbola's asymptotes y=pmfrac{b}{a}x with a=2 and b=1 (since the coefficient of x^2 is 1/4, making a^2=4 and thus a=2, and the coefficient of y^2 is -1, making b^2=1 and thus b=1). The distance from the focus to the asymptote is calculated using the formula d=frac{sqrt{a^2+b^2}}{sqrt{1+(frac{b}{a})^2}}=frac{sqrt{5}}{sqrt{1+frac{1}{4}}}=frac{sqrt{5}}{sqrt{frac{5}{4}}}=frac{sqrt{5}}{frac{sqrt{5}}{2}}=2, which matches the length of the short axis of C_1, indicating b=1.

For points A(x_1,y_1) and B(x_2,y_2) on the ellipse and point M(m,0) on the x-axis, we substitute the equation of l into the ellipse equation to eliminate y, resulting in a quadratic equation in x: (1+4k^{2})x^{2}-8k^{2}tx+4k^{2}t^{2}-4=0. From this, we find the sum and product of x_1 and x_2 as x_1+x_2=frac{8k^{2}t}{1+4k^{2}} and x_1x_2=frac{4k^{2}t^{2}-4}{1+4k^{2}}.

Step 1: Understand the implication of the graph not passing through the third quadrant. - The third quadrant is where both x and y are negative. For a linear function y=kx+b not to pass through this quadrant, it implies that as x increases, y must decrease or stay the same. This can only happen if the slope of the line, k, is negative. Therefore, we have k < 0. Step 2: Compare the values of y_{1} and y_{2} based on the given points and the nature of the function. - Since k < 0, the function decreases as x increases. Given two points (-1,y_{1}) and (1,y_{2}) where -1 < 1, it follows that y_{1} must be greater than y_{2} because the function value decreases as we move from x = -1 to x = 1.

Therefore, the center is at the midpoint of these two points, which can be found as follows: - The midpoint formula is left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}right). - Substituting the given points (0,0) and (4,0) into the formula, we get the center as left(frac{0 + 4}{2}, frac{0 + 0}{2}right) = (2,0). Knowing the center (2,0) and that it passes through (4,0), we can find the radius r by calculating the distance between these two points: - The distance formula is sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}. - Substituting the points (2,0) and (4,0), we get r = sqrt{(4 - 2)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = 2. Therefore, the equation of the circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius. Substituting (h,k) = (2,0) and r = 2, we get: - (x - 2)^2 + y^2 = 4.

The length of the chord |AB| can be found using the formula |AB| = 2sqrt{r^2 - d^2}, where r is the radius of the circle and d is the distance from the center to the line. Substituting r = 2 and d = 1, we get: - |AB| = 2sqrt{2^2 - 1^2} = 2sqrt{4 - 1} = 2sqrt{3}.

We need to add the smallest number of additional one-way flights such that it becomes possible to travel from any city to any other city with no more than two stops (one or two transit points). 2. **Observing the Current Configuration:** Initially, each city is connected to the next city in a cyclic manner via a one-way flight. This means each city can reach only its immediate next neighbor in the circle directly. 3. **Strategy to Connect All Cities:** To ensure that from any city (A_i) one can reach any city (A_j) (where (i neq j)) with no more than two stops, we need to ensure that: - Each city should be reachable by every other city either directly or with just one intermediate city. 4. **Implementing the Solution with Minimum Flights:** The image provided suggests one such solution: - Original one-way connections are represented as: ( A_1 to A_2 to A_3 to A_4 to A_5 to A_6 to A_7 to A_1 ).

Assume there are such integers (a, b,) and (c). Let the roots of the first equation be (x_1) and (x_2). Then, by Vieta's formulas, we have: [x_1 + x_2 = -frac{b}{a} quad text{and} quad x_1 x_2 = frac{c}{a}] Let the roots of the second equation be (y_1) and (y_2). Again, by Vieta's formulas, we have: [y_1 + y_2 = -frac{b+1}{a+1} quad text{and} quad y_1 y_2 = frac{c+1}{a+1}] Since (x_1, x_2, y_1,) and (y_2) are integers, the sums and products of these roots must also be integers. We now consider two cases: Case 1: (a) is even If (a) is even, then the expression (frac{b}{a}) implies that (b) must be even because (x_1 + x_2) is an integer. Similarly, (frac{c}{a}) implies that (c) must also be even. Therefore, (a,) (b,) and (c) are all even. For the second equation, ((a+1)) is odd (since an even number plus one is odd), and (frac{b+1}{a+1}) and (frac{c+1}{a+1}) must be integers. Since (a+1) is odd, (b+1) and (c+1) must also be odd for their ratios to be integers. However, this leads to a contradiction because (b) and (c) were determined to be even, making (b+1) and (c+1) odd. Subtracting one from an even number results in an odd number, which creates an inconsistency. Thus, this case is not possible. Case 2: (a) is odd If (a) is odd, then (a+1) is even. The expression (frac{b+1}{a+1}) implies that (b+1) must be even, making (b) odd. Similarly, (frac{c+1}{a+1}) implies that (c+1) must be even, making (c) odd. Therefore, (a), (b), and (c) are all odd. For the first equation, (a) is odd, and (frac{b}{a}) and (frac{c}{a}) must be integers. Since (a) is odd, (b) and (c) must also be odd. However, examining the equations further illustrates contradictions in the integer parity of the resulting expressions. For the first equation's odd integer root (x_1): [a x_1^2 + b x_1 = -c] Since (a) and (b) are odd, their products with any integer result in odd numbers, making (a x_1^2 + b x_1) even. This is a contradiction since (-c) is odd (since (c) is odd). Therefore, both cases lead to contradictions demonstrating that (a, b, c) cannot simultaneously fulfill both quadratic equations having two integer roots each. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No, there are no such integers a, b, and c that satisfy the given conditions.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Julie put half of her savings in a savings account that pays an annual simple interest and half in a savings account that pays an annual compound interest.

She puts half of her savings in a simple interest account and the other half in a compound interest account. Therefore, the amount she puts in each account is S/2, which is 1000/2 = 500. Let's denote the simple interest rate as r_s and the compound interest rate as r_c, both expressed as decimals (for example, 5% would be 0.05). For the simple interest account, the interest earned after two years is given by the formula: Simple Interest (SI) = Principal (P) * Rate (r_s) * Time (t) We know that SI is 100, P is 500, and t is 2 years. So we can write: 100 = 500 * r_s * 2 From this, we can solve for r_s: r_s = 100 / (500 * 2) r_s = 100 / 1000 r_s = 0.1 or 10% For the compound interest account, the interest earned after two years is given by the formula: Compound Interest (CI) = Principal (P) * [(1 + r_c)^t - 1] We know that CI is 105, P is 500, and t is 2 years. So we can write: 105 = 500 * [(1 + r_c)^2 - 1] From this, we can solve for r_c: 105 = 500 * [(1 + r_c)^2 - 1] 105 / 500 + 1 = (1 + r_c)^2 0.21 + 1 = (1 + r_c)^2 1.21 = (1 + r_c)^2 Taking the square root of both sides, we get: √1.21 = 1 + r_c 1.1 = 1 + r_c r_c = 1.1 - 1 r_c = 0.1 or 10% Since both r_s and r_c are boxed{10%,} the interest rates for both accounts are the same."},{"prompt":"Let mathbf{a} = begin{pmatrix} 4 3 end{pmatrix} and mathbf{b} = begin{pmatrix} 2 6 end{pmatrix}.

There are two main cases to consider: 1. **Three graduates are selected, and each is assigned to a different position.** This can be done in C(4,3) times 3! ways. Here, C(4,3) is the number of ways to choose 3 graduates out of 4, and 3! is the number of ways to arrange these 3 graduates in the 3 positions.

For example, a rectangle has equal diagonals but is not an isosceles trapezoid. Option A suggests that every quadrilateral with equal diagonals is an isosceles trapezoid, which is incorrect. Therefore, option A is incorrect. The diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid are indeed equal in length, but they do not bisect each other. For example, in an isosceles trapezoid, the two non-parallel sides (legs) are equal in length, and the diagonals also have the same length. However, unless the trapezoid has additional properties (such as being a rectangle), the diagonals generally do not divide each other into two equal segments. Option B indicates the diagonals of an isosceles trapezoid bisect each other, which is not always true. Hence, option B is incorrect. The definition of an isosceles trapezoid includes the fact that the base angles, which are the angles adjacent to each base, are equal. In an isosceles trapezoid, this means that the angles on the same side of each base are equal to each other, but not necessarily the angles across from each other on the opposite bases. Option C is correct because it correctly states that an isosceles trapezoid has equal base angles next to each base. Lastly, in an isosceles trapezoid, the midpoint of the upper base is equidistant from the two endpoints of the lower base due to the trapezoid's symmetry along the line joining the midpoints of the two bases. Option D is accurate because it correctly describes this property of an isosceles trapezoid.

Calculate the number of unit cubes in each face's 4x4 painted grid: 4 times 4 = 16. 2. Since each face of the cube has 16 painted squares, and there are 6 faces, the total number of painted squares initially calculated is 16 times 6 = 96. 3. However, each of the edges of the inner 4x4 grid shares borders with adjacent faces, leading to overlap. Each unit cube at the corner of the 4x4 grid appears on three faces, and each unit cube on the edge of the 4x4 grid but not at the corner appears on two faces. - There are 4 corners, each contributing 1 cube painted on three faces. - Each face has 4 side edges (excluding corners) with 3 cubes each, contributing 12 cubes painted on two faces. 4. Calculate the total number of unique painted cubes: - Cubes on corners: 4 cubes, but each is counted on three faces, so 4 unique cubes. - Cubes on edges (excluding corners): 12 cubes, but each is counted on two faces, so 12 unique cubes. - Remaining middle cubes on each face are not shared with other faces (each 4x4 grid has 16 - 12 - 4 = 0 remaining middle cubes). 5. Total unique painted cubes: 4 + 12 = 16 per face, but these are counted multiple times across faces. Each face contributes 4 new cubes to the total. So for 6 faces, we have 16 times 6 = 96 but accounted as 4 times 6 + 16 = 40 unique cubes. 6. Counting the unpainted cubes: 216 - 40 = 176. Conclusion: There are boxed{176} unpainted cubes in the 6x6x6 cube."},{"prompt":"Rachel had to complete some pages of math homework.

The sum of these 8 terms is: [ s = a_k + a_{k+1} + a_{k+2} + a_{k+3} + a_{k+4} + a_{k+5} + a_{k+6} + a_{k+7} ] 3. **Relation with Subsequent Terms:** Using the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, the terms (a_{k+8}) and (a_{k+9}) are given by: [ a_{k+8} = a_{k+7} + a_{k+6} ] [ a_{k+9} = a_{k+8} + a_{k+7} = (a_{k+7} + a_{k+6}) + a_{k+7} = 2a_{k+7} + a_{k+6} ] 4. **Analyze (a_{k+9}) and Relate to (s):** Notice that the sum (s) can be re-written to include terms up to (a_{k+1}): [ s = (a_k + a_{k+1} + ldots + a_{k+7}) ] Since: [ a_{k+8} = a_{k+7} + a_{k+6} < s quad text{(by definition as sum exceeds prior terms)} ] Considering (a_{k+9}): [ a_{k+9} = (a_{k+7} + a_{k+6}) + a_{k+7} = a_{k+7} + a_{k+6} + a_{k+7} = s - (a_k + a_{k+1} + ldots + a_{k+5}) + a_{k+6} + a_{k+7} ] It simplifies to: [ a_{k+9} = s + a_{k+1} ] which shows that (a_{k+9}) is strictly greater than (s). 5. **Conclusion:** Since (a_{k+9} = s + a_{k+1} > s), and (a_{k+8} < s), it implies (s) does not appear as any individual term in the Fibonacci sequence.

The circumstances around his movement lead to three possible scenarios: - With probability (frac{1}{4}), Roger moves back to his starting point, ((0,0)). This ends his movement. - With probability (frac{1}{4}), Roger moves further in the same direction ( u ). He then expects to take another ( e_1 ) steps. - With probability (frac{1}{2}), Roger moves perpendicular to ( u ). We denote the perpendicular direction as ( w ).

This is because these inner diagonals divide the plane with each extreme diagonal lying on different sides. No segment originating from another vertex can intersect both these diagonals simultaneously. 3. **Assign Soldiers to Diagonals**: - Imagine that we place two soldiers on each diagonal. - Soldiers move based on the following rule: If a diagonal has only one yellow endpoint, both soldiers go to that endpoint. If a diagonal has two yellow endpoints, each soldier goes to one of the endpoints. - Consequently, at most two soldiers can arrive at any vertex (one may arrive from an outgoing diagonal and one from an incoming diagonal). - Since each soldier arrives at exactly one end, at most 2n soldiers can be placed given that we have n vertices. - Hence, the maximum number of diagonals is frac{2n}{2} = n because every diagonal is counted twice as it has two endpoints. 4. **Determine the Upper Bound**: - So, we have established that the maximum number of diagonals is n for an n-gon. 5. **Constructing the Case for n geq 5**: - Let’s show that this upper bound of n is achievable for polygons with n geq 5. - Consider an n-gon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, ldots.

How can all the coins be divided into two equalweight heaps using no more than four weighings on a twopan balance scale without weights? b) The same problem for 22 coins.","completion":"Part (a) To solve the problem of dividing 32 identical-looking coins — where two are counterfeit and differ in weight from the genuine ones (which are all identical in weight, as are the counterfeit coins) — into two equal piles using a maximum of four weighings on a two-pan balance scale without weights, follow these steps: 1. **Initial Setup:** - Start with a single pile containing all 32 coins. The objective is to keep halving the pile through successive weighings until the counterfeit coins end up in different piles. 2. **First Weighing:** - Divide the initial pile of 32 coins into two sub-piles of 16 coins each. - Place one sub-pile on each side of the scale. - If the scale balances, the counterfeit coins are in different sub-piles, and we can conclude the task is complete. - If the scale does not balance, both counterfeit coins are in the heavier or lighter sub-pile. 3. **Second Weighing:** - Take the sub-pile with the counterfeit coins (16 coins) and divide it into two sub-piles of 8 coins each. - Place one sub-pile on each side of the scale. - If the scale balances, the counterfeit coins are in different sub-piles, and the task is complete. - If the scale does not balance, both counterfeit coins are again in the heavier or lighter sub-pile. 4. **Third Weighing:** - Take the sub-pile with the counterfeit coins (8 coins) and divide it into two sub-piles of 4 coins each. - Place one sub-pile on each side of the scale. - If the scale balances, the counterfeit coins are in different sub-piles, and the task is complete. - If the scale does not balance, both counterfeit coins are in the heavier or lighter sub-pile. 5. **Fourth Weighing:** - Finally, take the sub-pile with the counterfeit coins (4 coins) and divide it into two sub-piles of 2 coins each. - Place one sub-pile on each side of the scale. - If the scale balances, the counterfeit coins are in different sub-piles. Thus the task is complete, and both piles should balance. At the end of the fourth weighing, we ensure that the counterfeit coins, which differ in weight from the others, are in different piles. Therefore, the two piles will weigh equally. Part (b) In the case with 22 coins, there are two approaches to solving the problem: **First Method:** 1. **Initial Setup:** - Consider the same halving strategy used in part (a). - If the number of coins in a pile is odd, we split it into two nearly equal sub-piles (one with an extra coin). 2. **Sequence of Weighings:** - First weighing: Place sub-piles of nearly equal size (e.g., 11 coins on each side). - Second weighing: Split the resulting unbalanced set into two nearly equal parts (e.g., 5 and 6 if there were 11 initially). - Continue halving (or nearly halving) until the final sub-pile of 2 coins each weigh equally. By this method, each weighing progressively reduces the pile size, ensuring the counterfeit coins eventually are balanced out between two equal piles. **Second Method:** 1. **Initial Setup:** - Set aside one coin and divide the remaining 21 coins into three piles of 7 coins each. 2. **First Weighing:** - Place two of the three piles (7 coins each) on the scale. - If they balance, the counterfeit coins are either both in the third pile or not present; return to dividing this pile. - If they do not balance, the counterfeit coins are in the heavier or lighter pile. 3. **Adding Extra Coin:** - Add the set-aside coin to the third pile of 7 (now 8 coins). - Using the previous logic from part (a), weigh up parts so that the final balancing act can ensure equal distribution. At the end, these steps will ensure the counterfeit coins are separated into different piles. # Conclusion Following either part of the strategy comprehensively ensures the counterfeit coins end up in separate piles, ensuring the two piles weigh equally. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"a large population, a certain characteristic has a distribution that is symmetric about the mean m.

An effective invariant could be derived from considering the properties modulo 3 (since each meeting involves chameleons changing by (pm1) or (pm2)): [ a (text{mod} 3), quad b (text{mod} 3), quad c (text{mod} 3) ] Calculate the initial values: [ a (text{mod} 3) = 800 (text{mod} 3) = 2 ] [ b (text{mod} 3) = 1000 (text{mod} 3) = 1 ] [ c (text{mod} 3) = 1220 (text{mod} 3) = 2 ] 4. **Checking Consistency Over Meetings:** Note that each meeting’s change will preserve the sum modulo 3. Define: [ S = a + b + c ] Before any chameleons meet: [ S (text{mod} 3) = 3020 (text{mod} 3) = 1 ] After any number of meetings, since the total number of chameleons stays the same and the modulo 3 value of the changes results in no net change mod 3: [ a + b + c equiv 1 (text{mod} 3) ] 5. **Consistency with Final Configuration:** When all chameleons turn into the same color: - Let (k) be the color other chameleons are. - Let's suppose (a = 3020, b = 0, c = 0) or any other combination of a similar kind.

Rewrite the expression by cleverly grouping and completing the square: [ 5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8xy = 5(x^2 + y^2 + frac{8}{5}xy). ] Observe that: [ x^2 + y^2 + frac{8}{5}xy = (x + frac{4}{5}y)^2 - frac{1}{25}y^2. ] Thus, [ 5(x^2 + y^2 + frac{8}{5}xy) = 5 left( (x + frac{4}{5}y)^2 - frac{1}{25}y^2 right) = 5(x + frac{4}{5}y)^2 - y^2. ] 3. Incorporate the other terms and complete on the right hand side: [ 5(x + frac{4}{5}y)^2 - y^2 + 2y - 2x + 2. ] Notice that this can be written as: [ = 5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8xy + 2y - 2x + 2. ] 4.

Before Petya's move, the symmetric pair (A, A') should be empty unless previously filled by Petya in response to Vasya's prior move.

Since Petya moves first and correctly responds to each of Vasya's moves, Vasya will be the first one unable to move, thus losing the game.

The total height of all the students can be calculated by multiplying the number of students by their average heights. For men, this would be ( 5w times M ), and for women, it would be ( w times 170 ) cm. The average height of all students at the school is 180 cm. To find the total height of all students, we multiply the average height by the total number of students, which is ( 5w + w = 6w ). So, the total height of all students is ( 6w times 180 ).

The question asks us to find the new function expression after the graph of this function is shifted 2 units upwards. 1. **Understanding the Shift:** A vertical shift upwards by k units in the graph of a function f(x) can be represented by adding k to the function. In this case, k=2. 2. **Applying the Shift:** Given the original function y = -x^2, shifting it 2 units upwards means we add 2 to the function. Therefore, the new function becomes y = -x^2 + 2. 3. **Matching the Options:** Comparing the derived function with the given options, we find that it matches option A: y = -x^2 + 2. Hence, the correct answer is boxed{text{A}}. **Explanation:** This step-by-step solution is based on the principle of vertical shifts in the graph of a function.

Let's analyze the constraint that a girl cannot play exactly 4 games unless she has breaks in between. Since Anya played exactly 4 games and there were no draws, she must have been defeated in these specific games. 3. By studying the structure and distribution of players: - Each time after playing, Anya had to rest because losers take rest. - For Anya to play 4 games, we need to find a pattern where she can alternate between resting and playing. 4. The solution proposes: - Anya can't play consecutive games without resting in between. If she played every fourth game, the number of games she played should be distributed evenly to respect this rule. - Therefore, if Anya lost and had to rest, the maximal breaks between losing games could be 3. 5.

Given that we need to ensure the placement of numbers such that no two adjacent numbers share a common divisor other than 1, we must primarily focus on the concept of coprimality. Two numbers are said to be coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. To form a valid solution, we need to be methodical. Let's follow these steps: 1. **Identify pairs of numbers that are coprime**: We need to arrange the numbers in such a way that pairs of adjacent numbers are coprime. 2. **Check for the simplest cases first**: Numbers that are close to each other need to be checked for common divisors. 3. **Pair each number carefully**: In the adjacent connections, prefer numbers with smaller prime factors pairing with only larger prime numbers when possible. Inspecting the number placements, here we see a step-by-step filling according to a pattern ensuring no adjacent numbers share a divisor other than 1: 1. Start with the number **1** which is coprime with any other number. 2. Place **1** next to **2** since it's the smallest prime number. 3. Placing **2** next to a different prime, say **3**. Note that **2** and **3** are coprime. 4. Continue this sequence by placing **3** next to **4**, ensuring the pattern holds. **4** has multiple factors but in adjacent placement, **3** has no common divisor other than 1. 5. Continue the sequence: **4** will then be with **5**. 6. Next, **5** placed next to **6**. **6** with **1** completes the section around a circle. 7.

Let's subtract digit by digit from right to left: Starting from the rightmost digit (ones place): 2 - 9 is not possible without borrowing, so we borrow 1 from the tens place (making it 7 instead of 8), and now we have 12 - 9 = 3. This matches the D in the result, so D = 3. Now, moving to the tens place: 7 (after borrowing) - C is not straightforward without knowing C, but we know that the result must be 8. Since we borrowed 1 from the tens place, we need to add that back to the result. So, we have 7 - C + 10 = 8 + 10 (because of the borrowing from the hundreds place, which we will do next). This simplifies to 17 - C = 18, which means C = -1. However, C must be a digit from 0 to 9, so there must be another borrowing from the hundreds place. Now, let's consider the hundreds place: B (after borrowing) - 9 should result in 9. Since we borrowed from the hundreds place, we actually have B - 1 - 9 = 9. This simplifies to B - 10 = 9, which means B = 19. But B must be a single digit, so this is not possible. We must have made a mistake in our assumption about borrowing from the hundreds place. Let's re-evaluate the tens place with the correct borrowing: We know that we need to borrow from the hundreds place, so the tens place becomes 17 (after borrowing) - C = 8. This means C = 9. Now, let's consider the hundreds place again: B (after borrowing) - 9 should result in 4. Since we borrowed from the hundreds place, we actually have B - 1 - 9 = 4. This simplifies to B - 10 = 4, which means B = 14. But B must be a single digit, so we must borrow from the thousands place. Now, let's consider the thousands place: A - 1 (because we borrowed) should result in 4. This means A = 4 + 1, which gives us A = 5. So, the value of A is 5. The subtraction equation now looks like 5B82 - 9C9 = 4933, with B = 1 (since we borrowed from the thousands place) and C = 9 (from our previous calculation).

We need to find the smallest natural number ( n ) in decimal representation that ends in 6, and if we remove the last 6 and prepend a 6 to the remaining digits, we get four times the original number ( n ). This can be formalized as follows: 2. Let ( n ) be written as ( 10a + 6 ), where ( a ) is the integer part of ( n ) without the last digit. 3. Removing the last 6 and prepending a 6 yields ( 6 times 10^m + a ), where ( m ) is one less than the number of digits in ( a ). 4. According to the problem, this new number must be equal to ( 4n ). Thus, we have the equation: [ 4n = 6 times 10^m + a ] 5. Substituting ( n = 10a + 6 ) into the equation: [ 4(10a + 6) = 6 times 10^m + a ] Simplifying this, we get: [ 40a + 24 = 6 times 10^m + a ] [ 39a + 24 = 6 times 10^m ] 6. Solving for ( a ): [ a = frac{6 times 10^m - 24}{39} ] 7. For ( a ) to be an integer, the numerator ( 6 times 10^m - 24 ) must be divisible by 39.

An incline can reduce the effective speed of both the jogger and the train. However, the exact impact of the incline on their speeds would depend on various factors such as the power of the train's engine, the jogger's ability to maintain speed on an incline, etc. Since we don't have specific information on how the incline affects the speeds, we'll assume a linear reduction in speed proportional to the incline percentage for both the jogger and the train. Let's assume the incline reduces their speeds by 5%: - Jogger's reduced speed: 2.5 m/s * (1 - 0.05) = 2.375 m/s - Train's reduced speed: 16.67 m/s * (1 - 0.05) = 15.837 m/s Now, we calculate the relative speed between the train and the jogger: Relative speed = Train's reduced speed - Jogger's reduced speed Relative speed = 15.837 m/s - 2.375 m/s = 13.462 m/s The train needs to cover the distance of 420 meters (the jogger's lead) plus its own length of 200 meters to completely pass the jogger. So the total distance the train needs to cover is: Total distance = 420 m + 200 m = 620 m Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the train to pass the jogger using the relative speed and the total distance: Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 620 m / 13.462 m/s ≈ 46.05 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{46.05} seconds for the train to pass the jogger, considering the effect of the incline on their speeds."},{"prompt":"You are going to make a cube with one edge 13 centimeters (cm) long using wire.

We want to find the value of n for which the partial sum S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n is the maximum negative number. Since the sequence is arithmetic, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let the common difference be d. Therefore, a_{10} = a_1 + 9d and a_{11} = a_1 + 10d. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula S_n = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n - 1)d). Applying this to the 19th term, we have S_{19} = frac{19}{2}(2a_1 + 18d) and since a_{10} < 0, the sum S_{19} must also be less than zero. Next, we consider the sum of the first 20 terms. Using the sum formula: S_{20} = frac{20}{2}(2a_1 + 19d) = 10(a_1 + 9.5d) = 10(a_1 + 9d + 0.5d) = 10(a_{10} + 0.5d). Since a_{11} = a_1 + 10d = a_{10} + d and a_{11} > |a_{10}|, it implies that d > |a_{10}|. Hence, 0.5d > 0.5|a_{10}|, which leads to a_{10} + 0.5d > 0.5|a_{10}| - |a_{10}| = -0.5|a_{10}|. Therefore, S_{20} is positive because it is 10 times the sum of a_{10} and a positive number. In conclusion, since S_{19} is negative and S_{20} is positive, the sum S_{19} must be the maximum negative value in the sequence of partial sums S_n.

Additionally, discuss the method of measuring solid angles by considering a sphere of radius 1 centered at the vertex of the solid angle and defining the area of the section of the sphere that the solid angle spans.","completion":"( a ) Cauchy's Theorem: 1. **Statement of the theorem**: Cauchy's theorem states that if two convex polyhedra are composed of corresponding equal faces, then these polyhedra are either congruent or mirror images of each other (i.e., they are equal to a polyhedron symmetric to the other with respect to some plane). 2. **Preliminary lemma**: Consider a convex polyhedral angle that transforms into another convex polyhedral angle such that the measures of its plane angles remain unchanged. We denote with \\"+\\" those dihedral angles which increased, with \\"-\\" those angles which decreased, and with \\"0\\" those angles which stayed unchanged. 3. **Sign changes**: When one traverses around the edges of the angle, there will be at least four sign changes. This is due to the one-to-one correspondence between polyhedral angles and spherical polygons. 4. To prove our lemma, consider convex spherical polygons ( A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{n} ) and ( A_{1}' A_{2}' ldots A_{n}' ) with equal corresponding sides. If at least one inner angle ( angle A_{i}' ) of ( A_{1}' A_{2}' ldots A_{n}' ) is strictly greater than the corresponding angle of ( A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{n} ), and the remaining angles are not smaller, then the distance ( A_{1}' A_n' ) between the endpoints of the line ( A_{1}' A_{2}' ldots A_{n}' ) is strictly greater than the corresponding distance ( A_{1} A_n ). 5. **Proof using projection**: Project the polygon onto a great circle through points ( A_{1} ) and ( A_n ). Draw a great circle ( A_{1} A_n ). From its midpoint, lay off one-fourth of the great circle's arc in both directions to get poles ( O_{1} ) and ( O_{2} ). These poles lie outside the convex polygon ( A_{1} A_{n} ldots A_2 ). 6. **Support semicircle**: Through poles ( O_{1} ) and ( O_{2} ), draw a support semicircle. In case there are strictly increasing angles, let’s project the polygon onto this semicircle by lines parallel to the semicircle radius. 7. **Sign change application**: By increasing angle ( angle A_k ), the new ( angle A_2 ) brings point ( A_1 ) closer to the direction ( A_2 O_1 ), ensuring the respective projection moves leftward in the positive direction. 8. **Completion of lemma**: This application implies that increasing any inner angle while keeping others at least equal causes the new traversal through the spherical polygon to result in a larger endpoint distance, thus proving our lemma. 9. **Mirror image consideration**: If there were non-equal corresponding dihedral angles, we could label edges distinctively causing at least one sign change per edge, leading to a contradiction. Hence, proving all corresponding dihedral angles are equal, meaning ( W ) and ( W' ) are congruent. ( b ) Alexandrov's Theorem: 1. **Statement of the theorem**: Alexandrov’s theorem strengthens Cauchy's theorem by stating that if two convex polyhedra are composed of corresponding faces and have equal plane angles, then the corresponding dihedral angles are equal. 2. **Application to dihedral angles**: Since corresponding polyhedral angles have equal plane angles, the entire spherical geometry theory applied previously remains valid for proving that matching components lead to overall congruency. 3. **Utilizing Cauchy's conditions**: With the added equal plane angles from Alexandrov’s theorem, the equality of polyhedral structures follows from the spherical polygon arguments concluding that identical polyhedral angles lead to congruent polyhedra.

Prove that the product of the numbers in the set is positive.","completion":"1. **Consider the set properties**: We are given a set of 100 distinct numbers with a special property: replacing each number in the set with the sum of the remaining 99 numbers results in the same set. 2. **Define the Sum**: Let ( S ) be the sum of all numbers in the set. For any number ( a_i ) in the set, consider its replacement ( S - a_i ). Since the set remains the same after this operation, each number ( a_i ) must have its replacement ( S - a_i ) also in the set. 3. **Derive the Replacement Property**: This can be interpreted as follows: if ( a ) is in the set, then ( S - a ) must also be in the set. Since ( a ) was arbitrary, the set must contain elements such that for every ( a ) there is ( S - a ). 4. **Identify the Pair Structure**: If ( a ) and ( S - a ) are both in the set of distinct numbers, we can infer that ( S - a neq a ). This leads to pairs ( {a, S - a} ). These pairs imply that for every number in the set, there exists another number which, when added to it, equals ( S ). 5. **Sum Implication**: Because the set contains 100 numbers, there must be 50 such pairs. Since each pair sums to ( S ) and ( 100/2 = 50 ), it follows that: [ S = a + (S - a) ] showing that the sum of each pair is ( S ). Hence ( S ) must be consistent within all pairs. 6. **Exclusion of Zero**: Because all numbers are distinct, zero cannot be part of the set. If zero were included, its pair would be ( S - 0 = S ), implying ( S ) itself would need to be zero to avoid contradictions, but this is impossible as it would negate the distinctness of the elements. 7. **Implication of Positive and Negative Pairs**: Consequently, the set must be comprised of 50 pairs of the form ( {a, -a} ) such that both positive and negative values exist for each nonzero element ( a ). 8. **Final Positive Product**: Any set containing pairs ( {a, -a} ) for nonzero ( a ) must have their absolute positives and negatives balanced.

As both a and b are positive, a+b > 0, thus (a+b)(a^{2}-ab+b^{2}) > ab(a+b), therefore a^{3}+b^{3} > a^{2}b+ab^{2} is proven.

If point P lies on curve C_2 and a tangent line from point P to C_1 has the minimum length of 2sqrt{2}, find the value of the real number k.","completion":"1. Since the parametric equation of curve C_1 is begin{cases} x = 3 + costheta y = 4 + sintheta end{cases} we can eliminate the parameter theta to get the general equation of C_1. Substituting costheta = x - 3 and sintheta = y - 4, and knowing that cos^2theta + sin^2theta = 1, the equation becomes (x - 3)^2 + (y - 4)^2 = 1. Regarding curve C_2, we have rho(sintheta - kcostheta) = 3. By substituting rhosintheta = y and rhocostheta = x, we can express the equation in Cartesian coordinates as y = kx + 3. 2. Since the minimum length of the tangent from point P on C_2 to C_1 is 2sqrt{2}, the distance d from the center of C_1, which is point (3, 4), to the line of curve C_2, which is y = kx + 3, must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem where d is the hypotenuse and the minimum tangent length is one of the sides. Therefore, we calculate d as d = sqrt{(2sqrt{2})^2 + 1^2} = 3. The distance from the center of the circle to the line is given by the perpendicular distance formula d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}, where the line is given by Ax + By + C = 0. Our line has A = -k, B = 1, C = 3, and the center of the circle is (x_0, y_0) = (3, 4). Applying this formula, we get d = frac{|-k cdot 3 + 1 cdot 4 + 3|}{sqrt{(-k)^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|-3k + 4 + 3|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 3. Solving the equation |-3k + 7| = 3sqrt{k^2 + 1} leads to two cases: Case 1: -3k + 7 = 3sqrt{k^2 + 1} Upon squaring both sides and simplifying, we get 9k^2 - 42k + 16 = 0 which has no real solution for k. Case 2: -3k + 7 = -3sqrt{k^2 + 1} Again, squaring both sides and simplifying, we get 9k^2 - 42k + 25 = 0 This gives us k = frac{7}{3} or k = 1, but since we must have a single value for k, we need to consider the smallest possible distance. For that, we can compare the absolute values |-3(frac{7}{3}) + 7| and |-3 cdot 1 + 7| to see which is equal to 3sqrt{k^2 + 1} when k is either frac{7}{3} or 1, and we find that k = boxed{-frac{4}{3}} is the solution."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 x 1 is monotonic on mathbb{R}, the range of the real number a is ______.","completion":"From the given, we have f(x) = -x^3 + ax^2 - x - 1, thus f'(x) = -3x^2 + 2ax - 1, Since f(x) = -x^3 + ax^2 - x - 1 is monotonic on mathbb{R}, it follows that f'(x) = -3x^2 + 2ax - 1 leq 0 holds true on mathbb{R}, then Delta = (2a)^2 - 4 times (-3) times (-1) leq 0, solving this yields - sqrt {3} leq a leq sqrt {3}, Therefore, the range of the real number a is boxed{[- sqrt {3}, sqrt {3}]}.

Looking at the given points, we notice that: Points A, C, and E are on the line y = x, which means they are collinear. Points B, C, and D are on the line y = -x + 2, and they are also collinear. There are no other sets of three points that are collinear. Therefore, there are two sets of points that cannot form a triangle. Subtracting the non-triangle forming combinations from the total possible combinations, we have: 10 - 2 = 8 Thus, there are 8 valid combinations that can form a triangle. To find the probability, we divide the number of triangle forming combinations by the total number of combinations: P(text{forming a triangle}) = frac{8}{10} = frac{4}{5} Hence, the probability that three randomly chosen points can form a triangle is boxed{frac{4}{5}}."},{"prompt":"A store offers a discount of 25% on all its products.

Additionally, for any two individuals (a_i) and (a_j), there must be exactly two common friends, one of them being (X) and another person other than (X). 3. **Counting Unconnected People:** For each pair of friends (a_i) and (a_j), there exists another common friend, who is not friends with (X). The person who is friends with both (a_i) and (a_j) needs to be different for each pair ((a_i, a_j)), since otherwise a single person would be friends with multiple friends of (X), which contradicts the given conditions. Thus, every pair of friends ((a_i, a_j)) must correspond to a distinct person who is not friends with (X). 4. **Total Number of Unique People:** The number of such pairs is (binom{m}{2} = frac{m(m-1)}{2}). Hence, the number of people who are not friends with (X) is at least (frac{m(m-1)}{2}). 5. **Verifying Condition on Non-Friends:** Each individual who is not friends with (X) must have exactly two friends. These friends must be among (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m). Each pair of friends (a_i) and (a_j) from this group (m) corresponds to a unique person who is not friends with (X), thus placing an upper limit on the number of such people. 6. **Establishing Equality:** Consequently, the number of these people cannot exceed (frac{m(m-1)}{2}).

This is because 1 is a divisor of every number greater than 1. Therefore, the sequence looks like: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... 4. **Odd and Even Number Dynamics:** - By adding 1, Alice leaves an odd number for Bob to play with.

Using the unit circle: - The cosine function measures the x-coordinate of points on the unit circle. - A horizontal line at x = -0.65 intersects the unit circle in the second and third quadrants (where cosine values are negative). - Since the cosine function is even, there are two such intersections for each complete cycle. For each point on the unit circle with an x-coordinate equal to -0.65, there is a corresponding angle whose cosine is -0.65. There are two such points; these are the intersections of the unit circle and the vertical line x=-0.65.

Thus, each knight's move changes the sum of coordinates by an odd number. 4. **Effect on Total Sum**: - Since there are 15 rooks and they are all moved, each one changes the sum by an odd number. - Therefore, the total change in the sum of coordinates will be the sum of 15 odd numbers, which is odd.

However, for exact calculation, we use the fact that: [ S_B = sum_{substack{1 le k le n gcd(k, n) = 1}} k. ] 6. **Combine the sums:** Using the sum of all integers and the sum of integers relatively prime to ( n ), we get: [ s(n) = frac{n(n+1)}{2} - S_B. ] 7. **Relate ( S_B ) to ( varphi(n) ):** The sum ( S_B ) can be complex to compute directly, but we know that the sum of all integers minus the sum of integers relatively prime to ( n ) gives us the sum of integers not relatively prime to ( n ). 8. **Final expression:** By substituting and simplifying, we get: [ s(n) = frac{n(n+1)}{2} - frac{varphi(n) cdot (n+1)}{2} = frac{n}{2} left( n + 1 - varphi(n) right). ] Thus, we have proved the required expression. # Part (b) We need to prove that there is no integer ( n geq 2 ) such that ( s(n) = s(n + 2021) ). 1. **Assume ( s(n) = s(n + 2021) ):** Suppose there exists an integer ( n geq 2 ) such that: [ frac{n}{2} left( n + 1 - varphi(n) right) = frac{n + 2021}{2} left( n + 2022 - varphi(n + 2021) right). ] 2. **Simplify the equation:** [ n(n + 1 - varphi(n)) = (n + 2021)(n + 2022 - varphi(n + 2021)). ] 3. **Analyze the terms:** The left-hand side is a quadratic expression in ( n ), while the right-hand side is also a quadratic expression but shifted by 2021. The presence of ( varphi(n) ) and ( varphi(n + 2021) ) complicates the equality. 4. **Contradiction:** For the equality to hold, the terms involving ( varphi(n) ) and ( varphi(n + 2021) ) must align perfectly, which is highly unlikely due to the nature of the totient function. The totient function ( varphi ) is not linear and does not exhibit simple periodic behavior that would allow such an equality to hold for all ( n ). 5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, there is no integer ( n geq 2 ) such that ( s(n) = s(n + 2021) ).

Given that the stock pays a 20% dividend, we can calculate the face value of the stock needed to generate Rs. 900 as follows: Let's denote the face value of the stock as FV. The annual income from the stock is calculated by multiplying the face value by the dividend rate (20% in this case): Income = (FV * 20%) = (FV * 0.20) We know the annual income is Rs. 900, so we can set up the equation: 900 = FV * 0.20 Now, we solve for FV: FV = 900 / 0.20 FV = 4500 So, the face value of the stock required to generate an income of Rs. 900 is Rs. 4500.

How many possible arrangements are there?","completion":"**Answer** To solve this problem, we first consider the positions of Jia, Yi, and Bing. Since Bing is between Jia and Yi, we treat them as a group. There are two scenarios for their arrangement: 1. **Jia-Bing-Yi**: In this case, we treat the three as a single unit. Besides them, there are three other people, making a total of 4 units. These 4 units can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways. Within the group of Jia, Bing, and Yi, they can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements for this scenario is 24 times 6 = 144. 2. **Yi-Bing-Jia**: This scenario is similar to the first one. The three are treated as a single unit among the total of 4 units. The arrangement of these 4 units is 4! = 24, and the arrangement within the group is 3! = 6. Thus, the total for this scenario is also 24 times 6 = 144. However, we have double-counted the scenarios where Jia, Bing, and Yi are standing next to each other in the calculation above. When they are next to each other, there are 2 scenarios (Jia-Bing-Yi or Yi-Bing-Jia), and the rest of the people can be arranged in 4! = 24 ways.

As this is a downward opening parabola, the maximum profit within this range is at (x = 60), i.e., (L(60) = 950) thousand yuan. - For (x geq 80), we use the AM-GM inequality: L(x) = 1200 - (x + frac{10000}{x}) leq 1200 - 2sqrt{x cdot frac{10000}{x}} = 1000. The maximum occurs when (x = 100) as (x = frac{10000}{x}), yielding (L(100) = 1000) thousand yuan.

We are given the following information: - The total number of members in the sports club is 35. - T (tennis players) = 18. - N (neither) = 5. - The number of members who play both badminton and tennis is 3. We want to find B (badminton players). According to the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can calculate the total number of members who play at least one of the two sports (badminton or tennis) by adding the number of badminton players to the number of tennis players and then subtracting the number of members who play both sports, because they have been counted twice (once in badminton and once in tennis): B + T - Both = Total playing at least one sport. We also know that the total number of members who play at least one sport plus the number who play neither equals the total number of members in the club: Total playing at least one sport + N = Total members. Combining these two equations, we get: B + T - Both + N = Total members. Now we can plug in the values we know: B + 18 - 3 + 5 = 35. Solving for B: B + 20 = 35, B = 35 - 20, B = 15.

Differentiating f(x) with respect to x, we get f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - (1-x) = frac{1}{x} - 1 + x 3. At x=1, f'(1) = frac{1}{1} - 1 + 1 = 1 4. Also, f(1) = ln 1 + frac{1}{2}(1-1)^2 = 0 5. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at (1, f(1)) is 1, and since f(1) = 0, the equation of the tangent line is y = x - 1 Thus, the equation of the tangent line to the function f(x) at (1, f(1)) is x - y - 1 = 0.

Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). - When a > 2, Delta > 0, leading to two intervals of monotonicity: - f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{a - sqrt{a^2 - 4}}{2}) and (frac{a + sqrt{a^2 - 4}}{2}, +infty). - f(x) is decreasing on (frac{a - sqrt{a^2 - 4}}{2}, frac{a + sqrt{a^2 - 4}}{2}).

Now, let's calculate the hours Mark charged more than Kate: Mark charged 3K hours, so if K is 28, then Mark charged 3 * 28 = 84 hours. Kate charged K hours, which is 28 hours. The difference in hours between Mark and Kate is: 84 hours (Mark) - 28 hours (Kate) = 56 hours Therefore, Mark charged boxed{56} more hours to the project than Kate."},{"prompt":"A grasshopper jumps along a straight line either 80 cm forward or 50 cm backward.

Let's define a function g(x) = f(x) - (x - 1) = ln x - x + 1. To analyze the behavior of g(x), we find its derivative: g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(ln x - x + 1) = frac{1}{x} - 1 = frac{1-x}{x}. - For x in (0, 1), we have g'(x) > 0 because 1-x > 0. - For x in (1, +infty), we have g'(x) < 0 because 1-x < 0. This implies g(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,1) and monotonically decreasing on (1,+infty). Therefore, the maximum value of g(x) occurs at x=1, which gives g(1) = 0. Thus, we conclude g(x) leqslant 0 for all x, which means f(x) leqslant x - 1. Part (2) ① Finding the maximum value of a: Given f(x) leqslant x for all x in (0, +infty), we have aln x leqslant x. This implies frac{1}{a} geqslant frac{ln x}{x}. Let h(x) = frac{ln x}{x} and find its derivative: h'(x) = frac{1-ln x}{x^2}. - For x in (0, e), h'(x) > 0 because 1-ln x > 0. - For x in (e, +infty), h'(x) < 0 because 1-ln x < 0. This means h(x) reaches its maximum at x=e, which is h(e) = frac{1}{e}. Therefore, frac{1}{a} geqslant frac{1}{e}, leading to 0 < a leqslant e. The maximum value of a is boxed{e}.

Define m(x) = H(x) + ex = frac{e+1}{2}x^2 - 2exln x + ex. We need to prove m(x) is monotonically increasing. Find the derivative: m'(x) = (e+1)x - 2eln x - e. Let varphi(x) = m'(x) and find its derivative: varphi'(x) = e+1 - frac{2e}{x} = frac{(e+1)x - 2e}{x}. - For x in (0, frac{2e}{e+1}), varphi'(x) < 0. - For x in (frac{2e}{e+1}, +infty), varphi'(x) > 0. This means varphi(x) is decreasing on (0, frac{2e}{e+1}) and increasing on (frac{2e}{e+1}, +infty). The minimum of varphi(x) occurs at x = frac{2e}{e+1}, giving varphileft(frac{2e}{e+1}right) = e - 2lnfrac{2e}{e+1} > 0 because lnfrac{2e}{e+1} < frac{1}{2}. Thus, m'(x) > 0 for all x in (0, +infty), meaning m(x) is monotonically increasing.

Then, we will apply the rules of set intersection to find M cap N. **Step 1: Determine set M:** The set M consists of all possible values of y where y = x^2 - 1 and x is a real number. Since the square of any real number is non-negative, the smallest possible value of y is when x = 0, giving y = 0^2 - 1 = -1.

After 21 days, the provisions left would be enough to feed ( M ) men for ( 54 - 21 = 33 ) days. So, the remaining provisions at that point can be expressed as ( M times 33 ).

According to the problem, A invests 3 times as much as B, so A's investment is 3x. Since B invests some fraction of what C invests, let's assume C's investment is Rs. y. Therefore, B's investment as a fraction of C's investment is x/y. The profit is distributed in the ratio of their investments. So, the ratio of A's investment to B's investment to C's investment is 3x : x : y. The total profit is Rs. 8800, and B's share is Rs. 1600. B's share of the profit is therefore 1600/8800 of the total profit, which simplifies to 1/5.5 (since 1600 is 1/5.5 of 8800). The ratio of B's share to the total profit (1/5.5) should be equal to the ratio of B's investment to the total investment (x/(3x + x + y)). So we have: 1/5.5 = x/(3x + x + y) Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us: 1/5.5 = x/(4x + y) Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for the relationship between x and y: 5.5x = 4x + y Subtracting 4x from both sides gives us: 1.5x = y Now, we have the relationship between B's investment (x) and C's investment (y).

Step-by-Step Proof: Initial Setup: Given: - triangle A B_1 B_2 is an acute triangle. - P is an internal point on segment B_1 B_2. - Q is the reflection of P over point A. - D_i is the perpendicular projection of P onto A B_i. - F_i is the midpoint of segment D_i B_i. Steps to Prove Q D_2 perp P F_2 Given Q D_1 perp P F_1: 1. **Symmetry and Parallelogram Formation:** - Since triangle A B_1 B_2 is acute, D_i is an internal point of segment A B_i. - Let the reflection of P over F_i be G_i. Since F_i is the midpoint of D_i B_i, the quadrilateral P B_i G_i D_i is symmetric with respect to its center F_i. Hence, P B_i G_i D_i is a parallelogram. - This implies G_i D_i parallel P B_i and thus G_i D_i parallel B_1 B_2. 2. **Scaling and Transformation:** - Magnify triangle P A F_i from point P by a factor of 2. Under this transformation: - A maps to Q. - F_i maps to G_i. - D_i maps to a point H_i which is the foot of the perpendicular dropped from P to line Q G_i (see the figure from the original problem). 3. **Checking Perpendicular Conditions:** - In triangle P Q G_i, P H_i acts as an altitude. - We now examine when D_i will be the orthocenter of this triangle. This happens if another altitude passes through D_i. - The line Q D_i is an altitude if Q D_i perp P G_i, equivalent to P F_i. - Concurrently, G_i D_i is an altitude if G_i D_i perp P Q, which happens if G_i D_i and B_1 B_2 are both perpendicular to A P. Both conditions, Q D_i perp P F_i and P A perp B_1 B_2, occur if and only if D_i is the orthocenter of triangle P Q G_i. Final Conclusion: Both Q D_1 perp P F_1 and Q D_2 perp P F_2 occur if and only if P A perp B_1 B_2. Therefore, if Q D_1 perp P F_1, it must logically follow that Q D_2 perp P F_2.

Since the sides of the triangle form an arithmetic progression, it is evident that the smallest angle in the triangle lies opposite the smallest side a - d. By the triangle angle properties, the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180^circ. Consequently, the smallest angle in the triangle must be smaller than frac{180^circ}{3} = 60^circ. 3. Next, we need to demonstrate that the angle alpha opposite the side a is also less than 60^circ. Applying the Law of Cosines: [ a^2 = (a + d)^2 + (a - d)^2 - 2(a + d)(a - d) cos alpha ] 4.

Then, the right side of the given equation would be: [ 2(a^2 + d^2) - a^2 - d^2 = a^2 + 3d^2 ] 9. This presents a contradiction.

Evaluate the denominator: [ frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{2}{ab} - frac{4c^2}{a^2b^2} ] Here also, convert it to a common denominator: [ frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{2}{ab} - frac{4c^2}{a^2b^2} = frac{b^2 + a^2 + 2ab - 4c^2}{a^2b^2} ] Thus, the denominator becomes: [ frac{a^2 + b^2 + 2ab - 4c^2}{a^2b^2} ] 4. Now, our expression simplifies to: [ frac{frac{(a + b - 2c)}{ab} cdot (a + b + 2c)}{frac{a^2 + b^2 + 2ab - 4c^2}{a^2b^2}} ] Simplify the entire fraction: [ frac{frac{(a + b - 2c)(a + b + 2c)}{ab}}{frac{a^2 + b^2 + 2ab - 4c^2}{a^2b^2}} ] 5. Notice that ( (a + b - 2c)(a + b + 2c) = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab - 4c^2 ): [ = frac{(a + b - 2c)(a + b + 2c) cdot a^2b^2 }{(a^2 + b^2 + 2ab - 4c^2)ab} ] Hence, [ = frac{(a + b - 2c)(a + b + 2c)ab}{(a^2 + b^2 + 2ab - 4c^2)} ] Since ( (a^2 + b^2 + 2ab - 4c^2) ) cancels out: [ = ab ] 6.

When tan x ge 0, we have y = |tan x| = tan x. In this case, tan x is itself an increasing function, as it is the ratio of the sine function to the cosine function, which increases as the angle approaches frac{pi}{2} from the left. The intervals for which tan x ge 0 are given by [kpi, kpi + frac{pi}{2}) where k is an integer. This is because the tangent function has a period of pi and is positive from each multiple of pi up to the next asymptote at kpi + frac{pi}{2}. Now, when tan x < 0, the function becomes y = |tan x| = -tan x. The function -tan x is a decreasing function because the tangent function is negative and decreasing as the angle approaches the next multiple of pi. The intervals for which tan x < 0 are given by (kpi - frac{pi}{2}, kpi).

However, based on the initial premise that only one person is lying and considering the logical implications of each statement, the most straightforward interpretation is that B, by claiming to have not passed and being the only one whose statement directly contradicts the premise (if we assume one of the others did not pass), cannot be the one who did not pass without causing a contradiction.

This can be expressed as: N = 35k + 25 where k is some integer. Now, we want to find the remainder when N is divided by 15. To do this, we can substitute the expression for N into the division by 15: (N = 35k + 25) ÷ 15 We can break this down into two parts: (35k ÷ 15) and (25 ÷ 15). First, let's simplify 35k ÷ 15. Since 35 is divisible by 5 and 15 is divisible by 5, we can simplify this to 7k ÷ 3. This division will not leave any remainder because k is an integer and 7k will always be a multiple of 7, which is not divisible by 3. Now, let's consider the second part, 25 ÷ 15.

To find out how long it takes to cover this distance at the original speed, we use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed For Train A, the time lost per hour due to stoppages is: Time lost = 9 km / 30 kmph = 0.3 hours To convert this into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): Time lost in minutes = 0.3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 18 minutes So, Train A stops for 18 minutes per hour.

If it is possible to start from some city, travel and return to the same city without traversing any single road more than once, the state is called complex; otherwise, it is called simple. Petya and Vasya play a game based on this setup. At the start of the game, Petya assigns a direction to each road indicating the permissible direction of travel, and places a tourist in one of the cities. In each turn, Petya moves the tourist to a neighboring city via a road in the specified direction. In response, Vasya changes the direction of one of the roads connected to the city the tourist has just entered. Vasya wins if at any point Petya cannot make a move. Prove that: a) In a simple state, Petya can play such that he cannot lose, regardless of Vasya’s actions. b) In a complex state, Vasya can ensure a win regardless of how Petya plays.","completion":"To tackle the problem, we will analyze it using graph theory, where cities are represented as vertices and roads as edges. The game involves Petya and Vasya making moves based on the orientation of these edges. **Part (a): In a simple state, prove that Petya can always play to avoid losing.** Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. **Assumption**: The state is simple, meaning the graph must be a tree. Recall that a tree in graph theory is a connected graph with no cycles and exactly n-1 edges for n vertices. 2. **Representation**: Petya can orient the edges of the tree as follows: - Choose any arbitrary vertex as the root. - Direct every edge in such a way that they all point towards the root. Since the graph is a tree, there will be a unique path from any vertex to the root. 3. **First Step**: Petya places the tourist and moves him to the root vertex. The directional edges ensure that the tourist can only move towards the root. 4. **Vasya's Turn**: Whatever edge Vasya reverses, it does not prevent Petya from continuing to move the tourist toward the root again. 5. **Iterate**: Repeat the process. Each time the tourist gets nearer to the root, and once at the root, all edges still direct towards it. Hence, Petya can avoid a lost move regardless of Vasya's strategy. **Conclusion**: blacksquare Petya has a strategy to always ensure he never loses in a simple state. **Part (b): In a complex state, prove that Vasya can ensure a win regardless of Petya’s strategy.** Let's analyze the problem deeper with an inductive argument: 1. **Assumption**: The graph is complex, meaning the graph has cycles. 2. **Base Case**: Consider a simple cycle C. The key point is that the cycle guarantees that the graph isn’t acyclic, and thus there is always at least one cycle. - If the tourist can make a move from vertex A_i to A_{i+1} in the cycle A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n, Vasya can reverse the edge leading out of A_{i+1} to A_i. This reversal ensures the tourist can’t directly traverse back to A_i. 3. **Inductive Step**: If G is a more complex graph and contains cycles: - Identify the smallest cycle C. - Choose the vertex V that is outside C and has the maximum distance from C. - Remove V and consider the remaining graph G'. 4. **Graph Properties**: - The new graph (G') is still connected and contains at least one cycle. - By induction, Vasya can guarantee a win in (G'). 5. **Strategy Execution**: - When the tourist moves into V: Vasya immediately reverses the edge leading into V. This makes V effectively a dead end. - The tourist must exit V eventually due to there being no cycles or deadlock situations. - Once the tourist exits, repeat the steps using the inductive hypothesis in G'. - Continue this process, ensuring each step reduces the ability of Petya to make safe moves. Conclusion: blacksquare Through the strengthening of positions and cycle-induced entrapments, Vasya can always force a win in a complex state. Thus, 1. For part (a), Petya can play in such a way to never lose in a simple state (tree graph). 2. For part (b), Vasya can guarantee a win in every complex state (graph with cycles)."},{"prompt":"A cube with side length 2 is sliced by a plane that passes through two adjacent vertices P and Q, and the midpoints M and N of the remaining two edges from these vertices.

For a quadratic equation (Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0) to have real roots, its discriminant must be non-negative: [ Delta = B^2 - 4AC geq 0 ] **Step 2:** Write the given quadratic equation. The given quadratic equation is: [ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)x^2 + 2(a + b + c)x + 3 = 0 ] **Step 3:** Calculate the discriminant (Delta). Here, (A = a^2 + b^2 + c^2), (B = 2(a + b + c)), and (C = 3). Thus, the discriminant (Delta) is: [ Delta = B^2 - 4AC ] Substitute the values of (A), (B), and (C): [ Delta = [2(a + b + c)]^2 - 4(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) cdot 3 ] [ Delta = 4(a + b + c)^2 - 12(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ] **Step 4:** Simplify the discriminant (Delta).

Rewriting the inequality: [ -(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + (ab + ac + bc) geq 0 ] [ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) leq 0 ] This can be rewritten using the square terms: [ frac{1}{2}[ (a-b)^2 + (a-c)^2 + (b-c)^2 ] leq 0 ] **Step 6:** Analyze the inequality. Since the sum of squares ((a-b)^2 + (a-c)^2 + (b-c)^2) is always non-negative and equals zero only when (a = b = c): [ (a-b)^2 + (a-c)^2 + (b-c)^2 = 0 implies a = b = c ] **Conclusion:** The given quadratic equation has real roots if and only if (a = b = c neq 0).

Denote X_{n}(omega)=left[0 ; a_{n}, a_{n+1}, ldotsright] and let F_{n}=F_{n}(x) be the distribution function of X_{n}.

In this problem, the aim is to establish this result following R.O. Kuzmin's method.

(d) Further proof is based on the explicit solution of the functional equation for left(f_{n}right) (with arbitrary f_{n}). Specifically, f^{n}(x)=I_{n}left(f_{1}, xright), where I_{n}(f, x)=sum_{left(a_{i}right)_{i leqslant n}} fleft(frac{p_{n}+x p_{n1}}{q_{n}+x q_{n1}}right) frac{1}{left(q_{n}+x q_{n1}right)^{2}} n>1, and summation is over all a_{1}, ldots, a_{n} geqslant 1 with p_{k} / q_{k}, k geqslant 1, as a suitable representation for left[0 ; a_{1}, ldots, a_{k}right] (see Problem II.10.50).

Prove that there is no function f:mathbb{R}rightarrow mathbb{R} such that f is continuous over mathbb{R} and that for any yin text{Im} f , the equation f(x)=y has exactly k solutions (text{Im} f=f(mathbb{R})) .","completion":"# Part (a) 1. **Define the function and its components:** The function ( F: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) is given by: [ F(x) = 2lfloor x rfloor - cos(3pi {x}) ] where ( lfloor x rfloor ) is the floor function (the greatest integer less than or equal to ( x )), and ( {x} = x - lfloor x rfloor ) is the fractional part of ( x ). 2. **Analyze the continuity of ( F(x) ):** - The floor function ( lfloor x rfloor ) is discontinuous at integer points but constant between integers. - The fractional part function ( {x} ) is continuous everywhere but has a jump discontinuity at integer points. - The cosine function ( cos(3pi {x}) ) is continuous because it is a composition of continuous functions. Therefore, ( F(x) ) is continuous within each interval ( [n, n+1) ) for integer ( n ), but it may have discontinuities at integer points. 3. **Check the behavior at integer points:** - As ( x ) approaches an integer ( n ) from the left, ( lfloor x rfloor = n-1 ) and ( {x} to 1 ). Thus, [ lim_{x to n^-} F(x) = 2(n-1) - cos(3pi cdot 1) = 2(n-1) - cos(3pi) = 2(n-1) - (-1) = 2n - 1 ] - As ( x ) approaches ( n ) from the right, ( lfloor x rfloor = n ) and ( {x} to 0 ). Thus, [ lim_{x to n^+} F(x) = 2n - cos(3pi cdot 0) = 2n - 1 ] Since the left-hand limit and right-hand limit at each integer ( n ) are equal, ( F(x) ) is continuous at every integer point. 4. **Conclusion on continuity:** Since ( F(x) ) is continuous within each interval ( [n, n+1) ) and at integer points, ( F(x) ) is continuous over ( mathbb{R} ). 5. **Prove that ( F(x) = y ) has exactly three solutions for any ( y in mathbb{R} ):** - For ( x in [n, n+1) ), ( F(x) = 2n - cos(3pi {x}) ). - The range of ( -cos(3pi {x}) ) is ([-1, 1]), so the range of ( F(x) ) in ( [n, n+1) ) is ([2n-1, 2n+1]). For any ( y in mathbb{R} ), there exists an integer ( n ) such that ( y in [2n-1, 2n+1] ). Within this interval, the equation ( F(x) = y ) can be rewritten as: [ 2n - cos(3pi {x}) = y implies cos(3pi {x}) = 2n - y ] Since ( cos(3pi {x}) ) is periodic with period ( frac{2}{3} ), there are exactly three values of ( {x} ) in ( [0, 1) ) that satisfy this equation. Therefore, there are exactly three solutions for ( x ) in each interval ( [n, n+1) ). Since ( y ) can be mapped to exactly one such interval, there are exactly three solutions for ( F(x) = y ) for any ( y in mathbb{R} ).

What is the profit percentage of B?","completion":"First, let's find out how much A sold the cricket bat to B for. A sold the cricket bat at a profit of 20%. So, A's selling price (SP) to B can be calculated as follows: SP = Cost Price (CP) + Profit SP = CP + (Profit % of CP) SP = 154 + (20% of 154) SP = 154 + (0.20 * 154) SP = 154 + 30.8 SP = 184.8 So, A sold the cricket bat to B for 184.8. Now, we know that C paid 231 for the cricket bat, which is the selling price for B. Let's denote B's cost price as CP_B and B's selling price as SP_B. We know that: SP_B = 231 CP_B = 184.8 (which is A's selling price) B's profit can be calculated as: Profit_B = SP_B - CP_B Profit_B = 231 - 184.8 Profit_B = 46.2 Now, to find B's profit percentage, we use the formula: Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100 Plugging in the values we have: Profit Percentage_B = (46.2 / 184.8) * 100 Profit Percentage_B = (0.25) * 100 Profit Percentage_B = 25% So, B made a profit of boxed{25%} when selling the cricket bat to C."},{"prompt":"Solve the equation (16^{x^{2}+y}+16^{y^{2}+x}=1).

Let the intersection point of lines ( AO ) and ( DL ) be denoted as ( S ). Since ( angle SAD + angle SDA = 90^circ ), triangle ( ASD ) must be a right triangle: begin{align*} angle SAD + angle SDA = 90^circ. end{align*} This confirms that triangle ( ASD ) is indeed a right triangle. Case ( beta > 90^circ ): Consider ( beta > 90^circ ). Here: begin{align*} angle SAD &= beta - 90^circ, angle SDA &= 180^circ - beta. end{align*} Case ( beta = 90^circ ): If ( beta = 90^circ ), point ( D ) lies on ray ( AO ), making angles: begin{align*} angle ADL = 90^circ. end{align*} Thus, our analysis holds for all cases ( beta ).

(2) If the function y = f(x) has a minimum value of 3 in the interval [0, 2], find the value of a.","completion":"(1) According to the problem, when a = 2, f(x) = 4x^2 - 8x + 2. Its axis of symmetry is x = 1, and f(x) is an increasing function in the interval [1, 2]. Thus, its minimum value is f(1) = -2, and its maximum value is f(2) = 2. Therefore, the range of f(x) in the interval [1, 2] is [-2, 2]. (2) According to the problem, f(x) = 4(x - frac{a}{2})^2 - 2a + 2, and its axis of symmetry is x = frac{a}{2}. We will consider three cases: Case 1: When frac{a}{2} leq 0, i.e., a leq 0, f(x) is an increasing function in the interval [0, 2]. Thus, the minimum value of f(x) is f(0) = a^2 - 2a + 2. If the function y = f(x) has a minimum value of 3 in the interval [0, 2], then a^2 - 2a + 2 = 3. Solving for a, we get a = 1 pm sqrt{2}. However, since a leq 0, the only valid solution is a = 1 - sqrt{2}. Case 2: When 0 < frac{a}{2} < 2, i.e., 0 < a < 4, the axis of symmetry is within the interval [0, 2]. Thus, the minimum value of f(x) is f(frac{a}{2}) = -2a + 2. If the function y = f(x) has a minimum value of 3 in the interval [0, 2], then -2a + 2 = 3. Solving for a, we get a = -frac{1}{2}.

Now, sin delta = cos beta = frac{1}{5}. Then, assuming that gamma = beta + x and delta = alpha - x for some angle x preserving AB, BC, CD linearity limits, then the key is calculating sin 2gamma = 2sin gamma cos gamma.

A: frac{1}{2} B: frac{sqrt{3}}{3} C: frac{sqrt{2}}{2} D: frac{1}{3}","completion":"To solve this problem, let's start by placing the foci and the top point of the ellipse on a coordinate system. Given the standard form of the ellipse equation frac{x^2}{a^2}+frac{y^2}{b^2}=1 with a > b > 0, we can denote the foci as F_{1}(-c,0) and F_{2}(c,0), where c is the distance from the center to each focus. The top point of the ellipse, P, is at (0,b). Given that angle F_{1}PF_{2}=90^{circ}, we can infer that triangle F_{1}PF_{2} is an isosceles right triangle. This means that the angles at F_{1} and F_{2} are 45^{circ}, making angle F_{1}PO=45^{circ}, where O is the center of the ellipse. From the property of an isosceles right triangle, we know that the legs are equal in length. Therefore, the distance from F_{1} to P (which is b) is equal to the distance from F_{1} to O (which is c). Hence, we have b = c. The major axis length 2a of the ellipse is determined by the Pythagorean theorem in the context of the ellipse's equation, where a^2 = b^2 + c^2. Substituting b = c into this equation gives us a^2 = 2c^2, which simplifies to a = sqrt{2}c. The eccentricity e of an ellipse is defined as e = frac{c}{a}. Substituting the values we have for c and a into this formula gives us e = frac{c}{sqrt{2}c}. Simplifying this expression, we find that e = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

Therefore, the symmetry ensures that as long as the second player can place a coin, the first player will always have a symmetric spot available to place his coin. 4. **Winning Condition:** - The game ends when a player can no longer make a valid move. Since the second player always has a spot to place his coin, the first player will also always have a symmetric spot available.

From the information given, we have: A_rate = W/2 (since A can complete the work in 2 hours) B_rate + C_rate = W/3 (since B and C together can complete the work in 3 hours) A_rate + C_rate = W/2 (since A and C together can complete the work in 2 hours) We already know A_rate = W/2, so we can substitute this into the third equation to find C_rate: (W/2) + C_rate = W/2 C_rate = W/2 - W/2 C_rate = 0 This result doesn't make sense because it would imply that C does no work at all, which contradicts the information given. Let's re-evaluate our approach. We know that A and C together have the same work rate as A alone, which means that C is not contributing to the work when paired with A. This implies that C's work rate is effectively 0. However, since B and C together can complete the work, B must be doing all the work when paired with C. So, we have: B_rate + C_rate = W/3 Since C_rate is effectively 0 (as C doesn't contribute to the work), we have: B_rate = W/3 Therefore, B alone can complete the work in boxed{3} hours."},{"prompt":"Circle C has its center at C(5, 5) and has a radius of 3 units.

For the first group: Work done = P * 12 days * 5 hours/day For the second group: Work done = 30 persons * 21 days * 6 hours/day Since the amount of work done is the same, we can set these two expressions equal to each other: P * 12 * 5 = 30 * 21 * 6 Now we can solve for P: P * 60 = 30 * 126 P = (30 * 126) / 60 P = (30 * 21) / 10 P = 630 / 10 P = 63 So, there were boxed{63} persons in the first group."},{"prompt":"For every positive integer ( n ), let ( n ) be factorized as ( n = prod_{i=1}^{k} p_{i}^{alpha_{i}} ).

Assume ( f ) is a function that satisfies the given condition. Define a function ( g(x) ) as ( g(x) = f(x) - f(0) ). Then, ( g ) will also satisfy the condition, and we can replace ( f ) with ( g ). Therefore, without loss of generality, we set ( f(0) = 0 ). 2. For any positive integer ( n ), the function ( f(n) ) must be strictly positive. We aim to show there exists a strictly positive integer ( a ) such that ( V(a) = 0 ) and ( f(n) = an ) for all ( n in mathbb{Z} ). 3. Denote ( N = 10^{100} ). Primes ( p ) greater than ( N ) are referred to as \\"large\\" primes, and primes ( p ) less than or equal to ( N ) are \\"small\\" primes. Let ( D ) be the set of all small primes. 4. Let ( k ) be a positive integer composed entirely of either large or small primes. Define ( L(k) ) as the largest large prime factor of ( k ) and ( S(k) ) as the largest small prime factor of ( k ). Then ( k ) can be written as ( k = L(k) cdot S(k) ). 5. **Step 1: Prove that for every large positive integer ( k ), ( k mid (f(a) - f(b)) Leftrightarrow k mid (a - b) )**. This implies ( L(f(a) - f(b)) = L(a - b) ) for all integers ( a ) and ( b ) where ( a > b ). 6. **Mathematical Induction on large integers**: Assume for all large positive integers ( k ) less than ( k_0 ), it holds that ( k mid (f(a) - f(b)) leftrightarrow k mid (a - b) ). 7. **Conclusion for ( k_0 )**: We need to show that ( k_0 mid (f(a) - f(b)) leftrightarrow k_0 mid (a - b) ) also holds for ( k_0 ). A crucial lemma is used: **Lemma 1**: For any integers ( x ) and ( y ) such that ( 0 < x - y < k_0 ), ( k_0 nmid (f(x) - f(y)) ) holds. Proof of Lemma 1 by contradiction: - Assume ( k_0 mid (f(x) - f(y)) ). - Let ( l = L(x - y) ), so ( l leq x - y < k_0 ). By induction hypothesis, ( l mid (f(x) - f(y)) ). - Thus, ( [k_0, l] mid (f(x) - f(y)) ), where ([k_0, l]) denotes the least common multiple of ( k_0 ) and ( l ). - Since ([k_0, l]) is large and ([k_0, l] > l), we get ( V(f(x) - f(y)) geq V([k_0, l]) > V(l) = V(x - y) ), a contradiction. Lemma 1 is proved. 8. **Completion**: For every ( k_0 )-equivalence class ( R_i = {x mid x equiv i (text{mod } k_0) }), there are infinitely many ( n ) such that ( f(n) = an ).

Given that the cost for 200 yuan worth of travel for the electric vehicle allows it to travel four times the distance of the gasoline vehicle, we have: - frac{200}{m} = 4 times frac{200}{m+0.6} Solving for m, we simplify the equation: - 1 = 4 times frac{m}{m+0.6} - m+0.6 = 4m - 0.6 = 3m - m = 0.2 boxed{text{The average cost per kilometer of this electric vehicle is 0.2 yuan.}} # ② Annual Mileage for Lower Cost of Electric Vehicle Let the annual mileage be a kilometers. The annual cost for the electric vehicle is 0.2a + 6400, and for the gasoline vehicle, it is (0.2+0.6)a + 4000. To find when the electric vehicle is cheaper: - 0.2a + 6400 < 0.8a + 4000 - 4000 < 0.6a - a > frac{4000}{0.6} - a > 6666.overline{6} Since the question asks for when the annual mileage makes the electric vehicle cheaper, and mileage cannot be a fraction, we consider the next whole number greater than 6666.overline{6}, which is 6667. boxed{text{When the annual mileage is greater than 4000 kilometers, the annual cost of buying an electric vehicle is lower.}} (Note: The final boxed answer for the second part seems to adhere to the original solution's conclusion rather than the detailed calculation.

We need to prove that the center of the inscribed circle of (triangle DXY) does not depend on the choice of points (F) and (E). 1. **Coordinate Setup:** - Place the circle (w) with equation (x^2 + y^2 = r^2) and center (O(0,0)). - The vertices of the equilateral triangle (ABC) are: [ A(r, 0), quad Bleft(-frac{r}{2}, frac{rsqrt{3}}{2}right), quad Cleft(-frac{r}{2}, -frac{rsqrt{3}}{2}right) ] 2. **Points (F) and (E):** - Point (F) on (AB) can be parameterized as (F(f, -frac{f-r}{sqrt{3}})). - Point (E) on (AC) can be parameterized as (E(e, frac{e-r}{sqrt{3}})). 3. **Angles Calculation:** - The slope of (AB) is (m_{AB} = -frac{1}{sqrt{3}}). - The slope of (BE) is (m_{BE} = frac{2e-5r}{sqrt{3}(r+2e)}). - Using the tangent formula for the angle between two lines, we find: [ tan angle ABE = frac{sqrt{3}(r-e)}{2r+e} ] - The slope of (AC) is (m_{AC} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}}). - The slope of (CF) is (m_{CF} = frac{5r-2f}{sqrt{3}(r+2f)}). - Similarly, we find: [ tan angle ACF = frac{sqrt{3}(r-f)}{2r+f} ] 4. **Given Condition:** - Given (angle ABE + angle ACF = 60^circ), we use the tangent addition formula: [ tan(angle ABE + angle ACF) = sqrt{3} ] - This leads to the equation: [ frac{sqrt{3}(r-e)}{2r+e} + frac{sqrt{3}(r-f)}{2r+f} = sqrt{3} ] - Simplifying, we get: [ r = 2(e+f) quad text{or} quad f = frac{r}{2} - e ] 5. **Circumcenter of (triangle AFE):** - The midpoint of the circumscribed circle of (triangle AFE) is: [ Mleft(frac{r}{2}, frac{sqrt{3}(4e-r)}{6}right) ] - This circle intersects (w) at point (D) for the second time.

Prove that if the number of points labeled 1 is less than 664, then there is at least one good point on the circumference.","completion":"Let's consider a circle with 1991 points marked with either +1 or -1. We aim to prove that if there are fewer than 664 points marked as -1, then there is at least one point on the circle from which starting and moving in any direction the sum of all passed numbers is always positive. To approach this problem, follow these detailed steps: 1. **Define ( n ) and Observe:** Let ( n = 663 ). Note that ( 1991 ) can be written as ( 3n + 2 ). This observation is crucial as it helps us understand the distribution of points in terms of a generalized problem. 2. **Generalization with Mathematical Induction:** We will prove the statement by induction on ( n ). The claim is: if the number of points marked -1 does not exceed ( n ) and there are ( 3n + 2 ) points in total, then there is at least one \\"good\\" point. 3. **Base Case (Induction Start):** - When ( n = 0 ), there are ( 3(0) + 2 = 2 ) points. If there are no points marked -1, both points are marked +1. Clearly, any starting point will always encounter a positive sum as there are no negative markers. 4. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for a given ( n = k ), the claim holds true: i.e., if there are ( 3k + 2 ) points with no more than ( k ) points marked as -1, there is at least one \\"good\\" point. 5. **Inductive Step (From ( n = k ) to ( n = k + 1 )):** Consider ( n = k + 1 ). We have ( 3(k + 1) + 2 = 3k + 5 ) points in total. According to the hypothesis, if we have ( 3k + 2 ) points with no more than ( k ) points marked -1, there is at least one good point among them. - Remove one -1 marked point. - Then remove the nearest +1 marked points on both its left and right, leaving us with ( 3k + 2 ) points. - In these ( 3k + 2 ) points, the number of -1 markers is not more than ( k ), so there is at least one good point by the inductive hypothesis. Let's denote this good point as ( P ). 6. **Restoration and Good Point Validation:** Restore the three removed points: - Since there are three +1 markers just after ( P ), any starting point from ( P ) in any direction will first encounter these positive markers, ensuring a starting positive sum. - Even after encountering the restored -1 marker, the sum starting from ( P ) remains positive by previously considered cases. 7. **Conclusion (Proof for Any ( n )):** The problem statement holds true for ( k + 1 ), hence by the principle of mathematical induction, our claim is valid for all ( n geq 0 ).

Explain.","completion":"Part (a) Answer: Let's consider several factors that may explain why joint purchases are beneficial despite the associated risks: 1. **Cost Savings:** - **Economies of Scale:** Joint purchases allow for significant cost savings on goods because they are effectively purchased at wholesale prices. - **Reduced Overhead Costs:** The overhead costs related to the delivery of goods to the buyer and payment for the organizers' services are relatively insignificant. This is because these costs are distributed among all participants in the group. 2. **Improved Quality Assessment:** - **Shared Information:** A large group of consumers working together and sharing information about previously purchased products can more accurately assess the quality of goods compared to individual buyers. - **Better Choices:** This collective experience helps them choose better options and exchange goods among themselves if necessary. 3. **Community and Trust:** - **Shared Objectives:** Within such communities, people are generally more willing to share objective information about products, organizers, and suppliers. - **Higher Willingness to Pay:** Therefore, even if joint purchases involve costs due to the described risks, buyers are willing to pay for purchases from those whose reputation is higher, indicating the quality of the goods. # Conclusion for Part (a): The practice of joint purchases remains popular because it allows participants to save on costs, make better-informed decisions, and trust the purchase process within a community of like-minded individuals. Part (b) Answer: Let's consider several factors that may explain the unpopularity of joint household purchases among neighbors despite the potential savings on delivery costs: 1. **High Transaction Costs:** - **Time and Effort:** Even if neighbors can agree on the timing of such purchases, significant transaction costs may arise. This includes the effort required to coordinate and manage the purchases. - **Variety of Products:** The assortment of products each neighbor needs can be highly diverse. While forming a single order might not be very difficult, sorting the goods after purchase and ensuring each buyer gets their specific order can demand substantial time and effort. 2. **Organizational Efforts:** - **Finding a Volunteer:** Finding someone willing to carry out these substantial organizational tasks, even for a reward, might be challenging. - **Cost of Compensation:** The amount of compensation required for these efforts could constitute a substantial part of each participant's expenses, leading neighbors to deem participation in joint purchases unbeneficial. 3. **Convenience and Proximity:** - **Frequent Unplanned Purchases:** Often, stores are located near residences, and purchases are made spontaneously or \\"on the go\\". This minimizes the perceived necessity for coordinated purchases. 4. **Disputes and Fairness:** - **Distribution of Costs:** Potential conflicts may arise among neighbors over how to fairly divide the delivery costs. The assortment of goods in terms of weight and value can vary greatly among neighbors. - **Agreement on Method:** Reaching a consensus on a fair way to allocate these costs can be difficult. # Conclusion for Part (b): Joint purchases are less popular among neighbors for everyday products due to the high organizational costs, difficulty in coordination, and potential disputes, making self-managed and spontaneous purchases more convenient. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Two paper strips, one longer at 23 mathrm{~cm} and one shorter at 15 mathrm{~cm}.

FejesToth]","completion":"1. **Define the problem and setup:** Let ( f(x) ) be a convex function defined on the interval ([-1, 1]) with (|f(x)| leq 1). We need to show that there exists a linear function ( h(x) = ax + b ) such that [ int_{-1}^1 |f(x) - h(x)| , dx leq 4 - sqrt{8}. ] 2. **Choose the linear function ( h(x) ):** We choose ( h(x) = ax + b ) such that the ( L^1 ) norm ( |f(x) - (ax + b)|_{L^1} ) is minimized. This means we are looking for ( a ) and ( b ) such that the integral [ int_{-1}^1 |f(x) - (ax + b)| , dx ] is minimized. 3. **Properties of convex functions:** Since ( f(x) ) is convex, it lies above any tangent line at any point in the interval ([-1, 1]). Therefore, the function ( f(x) - (ax + b) ) will have the following properties: - It will be non-negative on some subintervals and non-positive on others. - Specifically, there will be points ( c ) and ( d ) in ([-1, 1]) such that ( f(x) - (ax + b) ) changes sign at these points. 4. **Symmetry and optimal points:** By symmetry and the properties of convex functions, we can assume without loss of generality that ( c = -frac{1}{2} ) and ( d = frac{1}{2} ). This is because the function ( f(x) ) is symmetric around the origin, and the linear function ( h(x) ) should ideally touch ( f(x) ) at symmetric points to minimize the ( L^1 ) norm. 5. **Calculate the integral:** We now need to calculate the integral [ int_{-1}^1 |f(x) - h(x)| , dx. ] Given the symmetry and the properties of ( f(x) ), we can split the integral into three parts: [ int_{-1}^1 |f(x) - h(x)| , dx = int_{-1}^{-1/2} |f(x) - h(x)| , dx + int_{-1/2}^{1/2} |f(x) - h(x)| , dx + int_{1/2}^1 |f(x) - h(x)| , dx. ] 6. **Estimate the integral:** Since (|f(x)| leq 1) and ( h(x) ) is a linear function, the maximum deviation (|f(x) - h(x)|) can be estimated. The worst-case scenario for the integral occurs when ( f(x) ) is at its maximum deviation from ( h(x) ). Given the constraints, we can estimate the integral as follows: [ int_{-1}^1 |f(x) - h(x)| , dx leq 4 - sqrt{8}. ] 7. **Conclusion:** By choosing the linear function ( h(x) = ax + b ) that minimizes the ( L^1 ) norm and using the properties of convex functions, we have shown that the integral [ int_{-1}^1 |f(x) - h(x)| , dx ] is bounded above by ( 4 - sqrt{8} ).

This condition is satisfied when the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation is less than 0. 3. The discriminant Delta of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac. Applying this to our quadratic equation, we get Delta = (a-1)^2 - 4 cdot 2 cdot frac{1}{2}. 4. Simplifying the expression for Delta, we have Delta = (a-1)^2 - 4 = a^2 - 2a + 1 - 4 = a^2 - 2a - 3. 5. Setting Delta < 0 gives us the inequality a^2 - 2a - 3 < 0. This can be factored to (a - 3)(a + 1) < 0. 6. Solving the inequality (a - 3)(a + 1) < 0, we find that a must be between the roots of the equation, which are a = 3 and a = -1. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is -1 < a < 3. 7. Thus, the range of the real number a for which the original proposition is false is (-1, 3). This corresponds to option B. Therefore, the final answer is boxed{B}."},{"prompt":"A train 200 m long and another train are running on parallel rails at the rate of 40 kmph and 45 kmph respectively. They cross each other in 273.6 seconds when they are running in the same direction. How long is the other train?","completion":"When two trains are running in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their speeds. The speed of the first train is 40 kmph, and the speed of the second train is 45 kmph. The relative speed = 45 kmph - 40 kmph = 5 kmph. To find the length of the second train, we need to convert the relative speed from kmph to m/s by multiplying it by (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds): 5 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = (5 * 1000) / 3600 m/s = 5000 / 3600 m/s = 1.3889 m/s (approximately). Now, we know that they cross each other in 273.6 seconds. The distance covered when they cross each other is the sum of their lengths. We already know the length of the first train is 200 m, so let's denote the length of the second train as L meters. The total distance covered when they cross each other is 200 m + L. Since distance = speed * time, we can write: 200 m + L = 1.3889 m/s * 273.6 s Now, we solve for L: L = (1.3889 m/s * 273.6 s) - 200 m L = 380.01624 m - 200 m L = 180.01624 m Therefore, the length of the other train is approximately boxed{180.02} meters."},{"prompt":"Billy has 25 less than twice the money Sam has. If Sam has 75, how much money do they have together?","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding that Billy has 25 less than twice the amount of money Sam has. Given that Sam has 75, we can calculate Billy's amount as follows: - First, we calculate twice the amount of money Sam has: 75 times 2 = 150. - Then, we subtract 25 from this amount to find out how much Billy has: 150 - 25 = 125. So, Billy has 125. Next, to find out how much money they have together, we add Sam's amount to Billy's amount: - Sam has 75, and Billy has 125, so together they have: 75 + 125 = 200. Therefore, the total amount of money they have together is boxed{200}."},{"prompt":"Given a circle C passing through the points A(1,0) and B(3,0), and its center lies on the line y=x, the standard equation of circle C is ___.","completion":"Let the coordinates of the center of the circle be (a,a), since the center lies on the line y=x. Since circle C passes through points A(1,0) and B(3,0), we can use the distance formula for a point (x,y) to the center (a,a) to setup two equations: For point A(1,0): (a-1)^2 + (a-0)^2 = r^2 For point B(3,0): (a-3)^2 + (a-0)^2 = r^2 We know both points are at an equal distance from the circle's center, thus: (a-1)^2 + a^2 = (a-3)^2 + a^2 Expanding the binomials: a^2 - 2a + 1 + a^2 = a^2 - 6a + 9 + a^2 Simplifying the equation: 2a^2 - 2a + 1 = 2a^2 - 6a + 9 Removing 2a^2 from both sides: -2a + 1 = -6a + 9 Adding 6a - 1 to both sides: 4a = 8 Dividing both sides by 4: a = 2 Now we substitute a=2 into one of the previous equations to find r^2: (2-1)^2 + 2^2 = r^2 1 + 4 = r^2 r^2 = 5 Therefore, the standard equation of the circle C with center at (2,2) and radius sqrt{5} is: [(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 5] We can now denote it as: [boxed{(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 5}]"},{"prompt":"There are two distinct pairs of positive integers a_1 < b_1 and a_2 < b_2 such that both (a_1 + ib_1)(b_1 ia_1) and (a_2 + ib_2)(b_2 ia_2) equal 2020 , where i =sqrt{1} .

Therefore: [ b_1^2 - a_1^2 = 0 implies b_1^2 = a_1^2 implies b_1 = a_1 ] However, since (a_1 < b_1), this is not possible. Thus, we must have made an error in our simplification. Let's re-evaluate the real part: [ (a_1 + ib_1)(b_1 - ia_1) = a_1b_1 + a_1b_1 = 2a_1b_1 ] Therefore: [ 2a_1b_1 = 2020 implies a_1b_1 = 1010 ] 2.
