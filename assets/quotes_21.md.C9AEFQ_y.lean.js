Thus: [ Q(x) = pm x^2 + ux + v. ] For this case, the values of the polynomial ( Q(x) mp x(x-1) = (u pm 1)x + v ) are divisible by ( Q(x) ) for an infinite number of integers ( x ), which is possible only if: [ Q(x) = pm x(x-1), ] hence, [ P(x) = x^2 text{ or } P(x) = 2x - x^2 = 1 - (x-1)^2. ] 6.

We start by noting the given function and equation: [ p(x) = x^2 - 10x - 22, ] where ( p(x) ) denotes the product of the digits of ( x ). 2. To proceed, let's consider the product of the digits of ( x ). For any positive integer ( x ), it can be shown that: [ p(x) leq x. ] This can be verified by induction on the number of digits of ( x ): - **Base Case:** For single-digit numbers ( x ), ( p(x) = x ). - **Inductive Step:** Assume the inequality holds for numbers with ( k ) or fewer digits. Consider a number ( y ) with ( k+1 ) digits. Write ( y ) in the form ( 10a + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are digits. Hence, [ p(y) = p(a cdot 10 + b) = p(a) times b. ] By the inductive hypothesis, [ p(a) leq a text{ and since } b leq 9, ] it follows that [ p(a cdot 10 + b) = p(a) times b leq a times b leq y. ] Thus, the product of the digits of ( y ) also satisfies ( p(y) leq y ). 3. Given ( x^2 - 10x - 22 = p(x) ) and using ( p(x) leq x ), we get: [ x^2 - 10x - 22 leq x. ] Rearrange to form: [ x^2 - 10x - 22 - x leq 0, ] which simplifies to: [ x^2 - 11x - 22 leq 0. ] 4. Solve the quadratic inequation ( x^2 - 11x - 22 leq 0 ) by finding the roots of the corresponding equation: [ x^2 - 11x - 22 = 0. ] Using the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ): [ x = frac{11 pm sqrt{121 + 88}}{2} = frac{11 pm sqrt{209}}{2}. ] Approximate the roots as: [ x approx frac{11 pm 14.45}{2}, ] yielding: [ x approx 12.725 text{ and } x approx -1.725. ] Therefore, the inequality ( x^2 - 11x - 22 leq 0 ) holds for values of ( x ) between the roots: [ -1.725 leq x leq 12.725. ] Since ( x ) is a positive integer, it further restricts: [ 1 leq x leq 12. ] 5. Since (0 < x^2 - 10x - 22 = p(x)), examine ( x geq 12 ). Combine the ranges: [ 12 leq x leq 12. ] Thus, the only candidate is ( x = 12 ). 6.

From f(0)=0, we substitute x=0 into f(x)=frac{mx+n}{{x}^{2}+1} to get: frac{mcdot 0 + n}{0^2 + 1} = 0 implies n = 0. From f(1)=1, we substitute x=1 and n=0 into f(x)=frac{mx+n}{{x}^{2}+1} to get: frac{mcdot 1 + 0}{1^2 + 1} = 1 implies frac{m}{2} = 1 implies m = 2. Therefore, we find that m=2 and n=0. After substituting these values into f(x), we confirm that f(x)=frac{2x}{{x}^{2}+1} is indeed an odd function on [-1,1]. **Solution 2:** Since f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in [-1,1].

Since the area of a triangle is proportional to the square of the homothety ratio, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^n k_i^2 cdot text{Area}(triangle ABC) = text{Area}(triangle ABC) ] Dividing both sides by text{Area}(triangle ABC), we get: [ sum_{i=1}^n k_i^2 = 1 ] However, we need to show that the sum of the homothety ratios themselves equals 1. Consider the signed areas of the smaller triangles. The signed area takes into account the orientation (positive for triangles with the same orientation as the original, negative for the opposite orientation). Thus, the sum of the signed areas of the smaller triangles must equal the area of the original triangle: [ sum_{i=1}^n k_i cdot text{Area}(triangle ABC) = text{Area}(triangle ABC) ] Dividing both sides by text{Area}(triangle ABC), we get: [ sum_{i=1}^n k_i = 1 ] Therefore, the sum of all homothety ratios equals 1.

Proceed by checking these possible forms: - **Case a**: Checking if ( p^2 + 11 = p_1^5 ) - Notice that if ( p = 2 ): [ p^2 + 11 = 2^2 + 11 = 4 + 11 = 15 ] ( 15 ) can be factored as ( 3 times 5 ), which does not meet the condition ( p_1^5 ). - Thus, ( p ) must be an odd prime. 5.

Consider 4 divisors form: - ( p^2 + 11 = p_1^2 times p_2 ), where by divisibility requirements and checking combinations: - ( p_1 = 2 ) and ( p_2 = 3 ) - Then, ( 2^2 times 3 = 12 ) does not easily lead to an integer ( p ). 8.

We will check each condition step-by-step: 1. **Non-decreasing property:** For ( x leq 0 ), ( F(x) = 0 ). For ( 0 < x leq 2 ), ( F(x) = x^2 ). Since ( x^2 ) is an increasing function on the interval ( (0, 2] ), ( F(x) ) is non-decreasing in this interval. For ( x > 2 ), ( F(x) = 1 ). Since ( 1 ) is a constant, ( F(x) ) does not decrease for ( x > 2 ). This property is satisfied. 2. **Boundary conditions:** [ lim_{x to -infty} F(x) = 0, ] which is satisfied because ( F(x) = 0 ) for ( x leq 0 ). [ lim_{x to infty} F(x) = 1, ] which is satisfied because ( F(x) = 1 ) for ( x > 2 ). 3. **Right-continuity:** For ( x leq 0 ), ( F(x) = 0 ), which is continuous. For ( 0 < x leq 2 ), ( F(x) = x^2 ), which is a continuous function. For ( x > 2 ), ( F(x) = 1 ), which is continuous. At ( x = 0 ): (lim_{x to 0^+} F(x) = 0^2 = 0). Hence it matches ( F(0) = 0 ). At ( x = 2 ): (lim_{x to 2^+} F(x) = 1) and (F(2) = 2^2 = 4). This is problematic because the left and right limits do not match at the boundary of the domain at ( x = 2 ). 4. **Range:** For ( x in (-infty, 0] ), ( F(x) = 0 ), which belongs to ([0, 1]). For ( x in (0, 2] ), ( F(x) = x^2 ). Since ( 0 < x leq 2 implies 0 < x^2 leq 4 ). Here, the function’s values lie outside the range ([0, 1]). For ( x in (2, infty) ), ( F(x) = 1 ), which belongs to ([0, 1]). Conclusion: Since ( F(x) > 1 ) in the interval ( (1, 2] ), it violates the condition that ( F(x) ) must be within ([0, 1]) for all ( x ).

However, the formation of water and hydrogen gas from dihydrogen monoxide is not a typical chemical reaction because water (H2O) is already a product of hydrogen and oxygen.

Since 1/3 of the rice's weight was lost, the weight lost from the rice is: 1/3 * 30 kg = 10 kg The total weight of the goods before any was lost is the sum of the weights of the green beans, rice, and sugar: 60 kg (green beans) + 30 kg (rice) + 50 kg (sugar) = 140 kg The remaining stock weighed 120 kg after the loss, which means the total weight lost is: 140 kg (initial total weight) - 120 kg (remaining weight) = 20 kg (total weight lost) We already know that 10 kg was lost from the rice, so the remaining weight lost must have come from the sugar.

Hence, we can make a change of variables: [ x' = x - 1, quad y' = y - 1, quad z' = z - 1 ] where ( x', y', z' geq 0 ) (natural numbers are at least 1, so the new variables are non-negative integers). 2.

This simplifies to: S_A + S_C = 2 times 180^{circ} = 360^{circ}. 3. **Assuming Order of Angles**: Without loss of generality, assume S_A leq S_C. Since S_A + S_C = 360^{circ}, we can substitute: S_A leq 180^{circ}. 4. **Unfolded Tetrahedron Analysis**: Consider the unfolded tetrahedron on the plane ABC. Let D_1, D_2, D_3 be the three positions of the vertex D in the unfolding. The angle relations are as follows: angle A D_3 C = angle D_1 D_3 D_2 and the segment ratios are: A D_3 : D_3 C = D_1 D_3 : D_3 D_2, which means A D_3 is similar to triangle D_1 D_2 D_3. 5. **Proportional Relationships**: Since S_A = S_B, it simplifies the similarity condition: triangle A C D_3 sim triangle D_1 D_2 D_3, with the ratio of similarity equal to the ratio of a leg to the base. 6. **Equal Segments**: Therefore, we derive the following equalities: A C = D_1 B quad text{and} quad C B = A D_1. 7. **Proving Triangles Equality**: Since S_A = S_B and similar angle and side relationships hold, the triangles can be overlaid onto each other: triangle A B C = triangle B A D_1 = triangle B A D.

D: If overrightarrow{AC}•overrightarrow{AB}＞0, then triangle ABC is an acute triangle.","completion":"Let's analyze each option step by step, following the given rules and structure: # Option A: Given that acos A=bcos B, we can explore this condition through the Law of Sines: - From the Law of Sines, frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B}. - Multiplying both sides by cos A and cos B respectively, we get acos A=sin Acos A and bcos B=sin Bcos B. - Given acos A=bcos B, it implies sin Acos A=sin Bcos B. - This can be rewritten as frac{1}{2}sin 2A = frac{1}{2}sin 2B, leading to sin 2A = sin 2B. The equation sin 2A = sin 2B implies either 2A = 2B or 2A = pi - 2B (since sine is periodic and symmetric). Therefore: - If 2A = 2B, then A = B, which means triangle ABC could be isosceles. - If 2A + 2B = pi, then A + B = frac{pi}{2}, which means triangle ABC could be a right triangle. Therefore, option A is incorrect because triangle ABC can be an isosceles triangle or a right triangle, not necessarily an isosceles triangle alone. # Option B: Using the Law of Sines, frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}. If sin B > sin C, then it follows that b > c. This implies, by the property of triangles, that angle B > C. Thus, we can conclude: boxed{text{B}} is correct. # Option C: For an acute triangle triangle ABC, we have that all angles are less than frac{pi}{2}. Thus, A+B+C = pi and A+B > frac{pi}{2} (since C is also acute and contributes to the total sum of pi). Therefore, A > frac{pi}{2} - B. Considering the function y=sin x is monotonically increasing in (0, frac{pi}{2}), we get sin A > sin(frac{pi}{2} - B) = cos B. Hence, option C is a valid conclusion for an acute triangle: boxed{text{C}} is correct. # Option D: The dot product overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{AB} > 0 implies that the angle between vectors overrightarrow{AC} and overrightarrow{AB}, which corresponds to angle A, is acute since the cosine of an acute angle is positive. However, this does not guarantee that angles B and C are acute, as the condition for triangle ABC being an acute triangle requires all angles to be acute. Therefore: Option D is incorrect because we cannot conclude triangle ABC is an acute triangle based solely on the dot product.

Since the 10% acid mixture is 90% water, the amount of water in this mixture is 0.9x liters. The 5 liters of pure acid contain 0% water, so the amount of water in the pure acid is 0 liters. After adding the 10% acid mixture to the pure acid, the final mixture is 40% water. This means that the total amount of water in the final mixture is 0.4 times the total volume of the final mixture. The total volume of the final mixture is the sum of the volume of the pure acid and the volume of the 10% acid mixture added, which is 5 + x liters. The amount of water in the final mixture is therefore 0.4 * (5 + x) liters. Now we can set up an equation to solve for x: 0.9x (amount of water from the 10% acid mixture) + 0 (amount of water from the pure acid) = 0.4 * (5 + x) (amount of water in the final mixture) 0.9x = 0.4 * (5 + x) 0.9x = 2 + 0.4x 0.9x - 0.4x = 2 0.5x = 2 x = 2 / 0.5 x = 4 liters So, 4 liters of the 10% acid mixture are added to the 5 liters of pure acid.

Let's consider all possible products of two identical digits that produce a two-digit number ending in a different digit. Here are the possible combinations: [ begin{aligned} &4 times 4 = 16, &7 times 7 = 49, &8 times 8 = 64, &9 times 9 = 81. end{aligned} ] 3. From the problem statement, it is indicated that the product of the digit hidden behind the mouse's mask, when multiplied by itself, ends with the same digit as the mask of the elephant. We need to examine the parity (evenness or oddness) of the digits to match the given conditions. The parity of one's place digit must be the same. Looking at the possible products: - (4 times 4 = 16) (both digits are even) - (7 times 7 = 49) (both digits are odd) - (8 times 8 = 64) (both digits are even) - (9 times 9 = 81) (both digits are odd) This condition suggests that in the first example, the products show digits of the same parity. 4. Given the digits must have the same parity and knowing that the sums are products resulting in different digits means comparing the results to one another: - (8 cdot 8 = 64): The final digit is 4. Thus the product (8 cdot 8 = 64) fits well; this identifies the digit for the pig's mask. - Since the product (64) is derived from even digits and ends in a digit 4, this means (4) is the digit masked behind the mouse. 5. Extending this reasoning to the second example, the similar characteristics such as identical parity must align the final digits. Since (4 times 4 = 16), the process splits clearly to differentiate the remaining digits: - (4 times 4 = 16): This fulfills each resulting product with an end digit of 6, thus assigning the digit 6 to the elephant’s mask. - Since ( (4 times 4 = 16), the result ends in 6; we conclude the correct digit masked behind the mouse is indeed 4. 6. Finally, through the incremental alignment: - (8 times 8 = 64) resolves the pig. - ( (4 times 4 = 16) fits the problem condition with ending integer for the elephant mask hence (6). # Conclusion: [ begin{aligned} &text{Digit for the elephant} = 6, &text{Digit for the mouse} = 4, &text{Digit for the pig} = 8, &text{Digit for the panda} = 1. end{aligned} ] [ boxed{ text{The digits under the masks are: Elephant = 6, Mouse = 4, Pig = 8, Panda = 1.} } ]"},{"prompt":"Dany owns a farm, in his farm he has 4 cows and some sheep that eat 2 bushels a day. He also has 7 chickens that eat 3 bushels a day. He should have 35 bushels to suffice the animals for a day. How many sheep does Dany have on his farm?","completion":"Let's calculate the total amount of bushels needed for the cows, sheep, and chickens. First, we know that the 7 chickens eat 3 bushels a day in total, not each. So, the chickens consume 3 bushels a day. Now, let's denote the number of sheep as S. Each sheep eats 2 bushels a day. So, the total amount of bushels needed for the sheep is 2S bushels a day. Dany should have 35 bushels in total to suffice all the animals for a day. We can set up the following equation to represent the total bushels needed: Total bushels for cows + Total bushels for sheep + Total bushels for chickens = 35 bushels Since we don't have information about how much the cows eat, we can assume that they are already accounted for in the 35 bushels, and we only need to calculate the bushels for the sheep and chickens. So, the equation becomes: 2S (for sheep) + 3 (for chickens) = 35 Now, we solve for S (the number of sheep): 2S = 35 - 3 2S = 32 S = 32 / 2 S = 16 Dany has boxed{16} sheep on his farm."},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Also, sin C = sin(pi - (A + B)) = sin(A + B). Thus, sin C = sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B = 2 sin B cos A. Rearranging, we get sin A cos B - cos A sin B = sin(A - B) = 0. In triangle ABC, since 0 < A < pi and 0 < B < pi, we have -pi < A - B < pi. Hence, A = B. (II) From (I), A = B, so a = b. Given that cos C = frac{4}{5}, and C is an internal angle of the triangle, we have sin C = sqrt{1 - cos^2 C} = frac{3}{5}. The area of triangle ABC is given by S = frac{15}{2}. Thus, S = frac{1}{2}ab sin C = frac{3}{10}ab = frac{15}{2}. This implies ab = a^2 = 25. Hence, a = b = 5. Since cos C = frac{4}{5}, applying the cosine law, we obtain c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos C = 10.

They say that more than half of the 1 person (themselves) is a truth-teller. This is trivially true if they are a truth-teller. - Moving to the 99th person, they say that more than half of the 2 people (themselves and the 100th person) are truth-tellers. This means at least 2 out of 2 must be truth-tellers if the 99th person is a truth-teller. - Continuing this logic, the (i)-th person’s statement imposes a condition on the number of truth-tellers among the last (101-i) people. 7. **Generalizing the Pattern:** - For the (i)-th person to be a truth-teller, the number of truth-tellers among the last (101-i) people must be at least (lceil frac{101-i}{2} rceil + 1). - This recursive condition must hold for all (i). 8. **Counting the Possibilities:** - The problem can be reduced to counting the number of ways to distribute truth-tellers such that the conditions are satisfied for all (i). 9. **Conclusion:** - By analyzing the conditions and the recursive nature of the problem, we find that there is only one way to distribute the truth-tellers such that all conditions are satisfied.

We know that 350 adults attended, so the total amount collected from adults is 350A dollars. Since there were 610 people at the play and 350 of them were adults, the remaining 610 - 350 = 260 people were children. Each child's admission price was 1 dollar, so the total amount collected from children is 260 * 1 = 260 dollars. The total admission receipts were 960 dollars, which is the sum of the amount collected from adults and children. So we have: 350A (from adults) + 260 (from children) = 960 Now we can solve for A: 350A + 260 = 960 350A = 960 - 260 350A = 700 A = 700 / 350 A = 2 The admission price for adults was boxed{2} dollars."},{"prompt":"Let n be a positive integer.

We need to determine the number of ways to form a \\"double staircase\\" in this grid. A double staircase is defined as a subset ( T ) of ( S ) (the set of all cells) that can be partitioned into ( n ) horizontal non-overlapping rectangles of dimensions ( 1 times 1, 1 times 2, ldots, 1 times n ) and also into ( n ) vertical non-overlapping rectangles of dimensions ( 1 times 1, 2 times 1, ldots, n times 1 ). 2. **Lemma 1: Distinct Rows and Columns:** Each of the ( n ) horizontal rectangles must be in distinct rows, and each of the ( n ) vertical rectangles must be in distinct columns. - **Proof:** Assume for contradiction that two horizontal rectangles are in the same row. This would leave at least one row uncolored, contradicting the requirement that each column must be fully colored. Similarly, vertical rectangles must be in distinct columns. 3. **Lemma 2: Contiguous Coloring:** Given two colored cells in the same row, all cells between them in that row must also be colored. - **Proof:** If there were uncolored cells between two colored cells in the same row, it would imply the existence of two separate horizontal rectangles in the same row, contradicting Lemma 1. The same logic applies to columns. 4. **Labeling Rows and Columns:** Label each row with a distinct number from ( 1 ) to ( n ) corresponding to the number of colored cells in that row. Let these numbers be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) from top to bottom. Similarly, define ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ) for the columns from left to right. 5. **Lemma 3: Sequence Order:** Suppose row ( a_k ) is the fully colored row for some ( 1 leq k leq n ). Then ( a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_k > a_{k+1} > ldots > a_n ). - **Proof:** For any row ( a_i ) with ( i < k ), any colored cell in row ( a_i ) implies that the cells in the same column but in rows ( a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ldots, a_{k-1} ) must also be colored. Thus, ( a_i leq a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ldots, a_{k-1} leq a_k ). Since all ( a_1, ldots, a_k ) are distinct, we have ( a_i < a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ldots, a_{k-1} < a_k ). Similarly, for ( i > k ), we have ( a_i < a_{i-1}, a_{i-2}, ldots, a_{k+1} < a_k ). This proves the lemma. The same logic applies to ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ). 6. **Counting Valid Sequences:** There are ( 2^{n-1} ) ways to pick ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) satisfying Lemma 3. This is because if the fully colored row is ( a_k ), there are ( binom{n-1}{k-1} ) ways to order the rest, and summing over ( 1 leq k leq n ) gives ( 2^{n-1} ). Similarly, there are ( 2^{n-1} ) ways to pick ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ). 7. **Claim: Unique Double Staircase for Each Pair of Sequences:** For any two sequences ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) and ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ) satisfying Lemma 3, there is exactly one double staircase corresponding to these sequences. - **Proof:** Place the ( 1 times n ) rectangle in its corresponding row. One of ( b_1 ) or ( b_n ) must be ( 1 ). Suppose ( b_1 = 1 ). Then, the ( 1 times (n-1) ) rectangle must intersect columns ( b_2, b_3, ldots, b_n ). Continue this logic iteratively to see that there is always exactly one position for the next rectangle. Thus, there is exactly one double staircase for each pair of sequences. 8. **Final Calculation:** The total number of double staircases is ( 2^{n-1} times 2^{n-1} = 2^{2n-2} ).

Step 1: Use the sine rule The sine rule states that in any triangle: [ frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} ] In triangle ABC, angle ABC = 60^circ. Note that the side opposite this angle is AC = 12. Suppose triangle ABC has a solution where angle BAC is such that it satisfies the Sine Rule. Step 2: Calculate k using sine Given angle ABC = 60^circ, [ sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] If we use the sine rule: [ frac{BC}{sin BAC} = frac{AC}{sin 60^circ} ] Assuming any general triangle where angle BAC = theta, [ k sin 60^circ = AC ] That gives us: [ k cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 12 ] Solving for k: [ k = 12 cdot frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = 8 sqrt{3} ] When k = 8sqrt{3}, triangle ABC exists with the given conditions. Step 3: Use triangle inequalities To further understand the range of k, we consider the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side. 1. AB + BC > AC 2. AB + AC > BC 3. BC + AC > AB Specifically: [ AB + BC > 12 ] [ AB + 12 > BC ] [ BC + 12 > AB ] Since we don't have specific values for AB and other angles without additional information, we consider the fundamental triangle construction. The side lengths must satisfy these inequalities, and usually, BC = k should fulfill 0 < k le 12, otherwise the triangle will not exist. Conclusion Thus combining all parts, we get the conditions for k: 1. k = 8sqrt{3} 2. 0 < k leq 12 (to satisfy triangle inequality).

The structure is built in layers with each block in the upper layers resting on three blocks from the layer below. The number on each block in the upper layers is the sum of the numbers on the three blocks directly below it. Step 1: Understanding the Weight Distribution The pyramid structure can be visualized as a series of layers, each contributing to the number on the top block. The weights of each block in terms of its contribution to the top block can be thought of as a three-dimensional version of Pascal's triangle: - **Layer 1 (Bottom layer)**: 10 blocks, each contributes to the blocks directly above in the next layer. - **Layer 2**: 6 blocks, each formed by the sum of three blocks from Layer 1. - **Layer 3**: 3 blocks, each formed by the sum of three blocks from Layer 2. - **Layer 4 (Top block)**: 1 block, formed by the sum of three blocks from Layer 3. Step 2: Calculating Weights for Each Block The weights for each block, starting from the top, distribute downwards: - **Top block**: Weight = 1 - **Layer 3**: Each block contributes to the top block, so weights are 1 each. - **Layer 2**: Each block in Layer 3 is supported by three blocks from Layer 2, so each of these contributing blocks in Layer 2 gets a weight of 1 (from Layer 3) distributed among them. - **Layer 1**: Similarly, each block in Layer 2 is supported by three blocks from Layer 1, distributing its weight among these three blocks. The distribution of weights from the top block down to the bottom layer is as follows: - **Layer 4**: 1 block with weight 1. - **Layer 3**: 3 blocks, each with weight 1. - **Layer 2**: 6 blocks, each with weight 3 (since each supports one block in Layer 3). - **Layer 1**: 10 blocks, with weights distributed as follows: - Middle block directly under the top block gets the highest weight (6). - The surrounding blocks in a hexagonal arrangement get weights of 3. - The corner blocks get weights of 1. Step 3: Assigning Numbers to Minimize the Top Block's Number To minimize the number on the top block, assign the smallest numbers to blocks with the highest weights: - Assign 1 to the block with weight 6. - Assign 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 to the blocks with weight 3. - Assign 8, 9, 10 to the blocks with weight 1. Step 4: Calculating the Minimum Possible Number for the Top Block The sum for the top block is calculated as: [ text{Sum} = 6 times 1 + 3 times (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + 1 times (8 + 9 + 10) ] [ text{Sum} = 6 + 3 times 27 + 27 ] [ text{Sum} = 6 + 81 + 27 ] [ text{Sum} = 114 ] Thus, the smallest possible number that could be assigned to the top block is boxed{114}."},{"prompt":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,m+1) and overrightarrow{b}=(m,2), determine the necessary and sufficient condition for overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b} in terms of m= _____.","completion":"Since overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b}, their cross product is zero, i.e., overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 0.

Can we manage to place all the pieces in the bottom 3 rows?","completion":"To determine whether it is possible to move all the 24 pieces from the top 3 rows to the bottom 3 rows on a standard 8x8 checkerboard, we need to analyze the types of squares and the movement rules more carefully. 1. **Classification of Squares**: We classify the squares based on the parity (even or odd) of their row and column numbers: - (text{Even row, Even column}): Denoted as EE. - (text{Even row, Odd column}): Denoted as EO. - (text{Odd row, Even column}): Denoted as OE. - (text{Odd row, Odd column}): Denoted as OO. This classification ensures that each square on the board can be uniquely identified by one of these four types. 2. **Initial Positions**: In the initial configuration, the pieces occupy the top 3 rows (rows 1 to 3). Let's calculate the number of pieces on each type of square: - **Row 1 and Row 3 (odd rows)**: - OE: 4 each row Rightarrow Total = 4 + 4 = 8. - OO: 4 each row Rightarrow Total = 4 + 4 = 8. - **Row 2 (even row)**: - EE: 4 squares - EO: 4 squares So, in the initial configuration, the distribution of pieces is: - 8 on OE. - 8 on OO. - 4 on EE. - 4 on EO. 3. **Final Positions**: In the desired final configuration, the pieces should occupy the bottom 3 rows (rows 6 to 8).

Upon comparison: - Initial count (8 on OE, 8 on OO, 4 on EE, 4 on EO) does not match the final count (8 on EE, 8 on EO, 4 on OE, 4 on OO). - Specifically, there is an imbalance. For instance: - EE: Initial = 4, Final = 8 - EO: Initial = 4, Final = 8 - OE: Initial = 8, Final = 4 - OO: Initial = 8, Final = 4 Concluding the above observation, since the parity distribution of pieces cannot be matched through the allowed moves, it is impossible to achieve the final configuration from the initial one given the jump and move rules. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No, we cannot achieve such a configuration.}} ]"},{"prompt":"a workshop with 49 workers, the average salary of all the workers is Rs. 8000.

By properties of algebraic numbers, we know that there exist natural numbers x_m and y_m such that: [ (sqrt{2} + 1)^m = x_m sqrt{2} + y_m ] 2. **Manipulating the Expressions:** Similarly, consider the expression involving (sqrt{2} - 1)^m: [ (sqrt{2} - 1)^m = x_m sqrt{2} - y_m ] 3. **Adding and Subtracting the Equations:** Adding the two equations we get: [ (sqrt{2} + 1)^m + (sqrt{2} - 1)^m = 2x_m sqrt{2} ] Since (sqrt{2} - 1) < 1, and for large m, (sqrt{2} - 1)^m becomes very small, thus the above equation implies: [ 2x_m sqrt{2} approx (sqrt{2} + 1)^m ] Now subtract the second equation from the first: [ (sqrt{2} + 1)^m - (sqrt{2} - 1)^m = 2y_m ] 4. **Relating x_m and y_m:** Combining the results from the addition and subtraction gives us a relationship between x_m sqrt{2} and y_m: [ 2x_m^2 - y_m^2 = 1 ] 5. **Considering Squares:** Using the equation, solve for x_m and y_m: [ 2x_m^2 = y_m^2 + 1 ] Consider y_m^2 to bring about our earlier sequence expression: [ sqrt{2} x_m y_m approx y_m^2 + y_m^{-2} ] 6. **Bounding y_m:** Noting that y_m^2 < sqrt{2} x_m y_m < y_m^2 + 1, we translate this to finding n = x_m y_m: 7. **Final Expression:** For large m, the approximations become tighter, thus: [ n = x_m y_m implies a_n = leftlfloor sqrt{2} x_m y_m rightrfloor = y_m^2 ] 8. **Conclusion:** Hence, a_n = y_m^2 is a perfect square.

This is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge. Total distance = Length of the train + Length of the bridge Total distance = 250 m + 300 m Total distance = 550 m Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s because the distance is in meters. The conversion factor is: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s Speed of the train in m/s = Speed in km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Speed of the train in m/s = 120 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Speed of the train in m/s = 120 * 1000 / 3600 Speed of the train in m/s = 120000 / 3600 Speed of the train in m/s = 33.33 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the time taken by the train to cross the bridge using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = 550 m / 33.33 m/s Time ≈ 16.5 seconds Therefore, the train will take approximately boxed{16.5} seconds to cross the bridge."},{"prompt":"A football team has 30 members. 18 members attended the last game: onethird of the girls attended, but all of the boys attended.

Thus, for left(frac{1}{x}-2xright)^5, we substitute x=1 to get: [ left(frac{1}{1}-2cdot1right)^5 = (-1)^5 = -1 ] However, this calculation is incorrect for finding the sum of the coefficients. The correct approach is to recognize that the sum of the coefficients in any polynomial expansion of (a+b)^n is 2^n.

A critic counts faults: each pair of adjacent red dots counts as one fault, and each pair of blue dots exactly two apart (separated by one dot) counts as another fault. What is the smallest number of faults the critic could find?","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to arrange the 1000 dots such that the number of faults is minimized according to the given rules. Let's start by analyzing a specific arrangement and then generalize to prove that it's optimal. 1. **Initial Arrangement (Red and Blue Alternation):** Consider an arrangement where red (R) and blue (B) dots alternate in groups of two, i.e., \\"(text{..RRBBRRBB..})\\" and so on. Let's see how many faults arise in this arrangement: - Each pair of adjacent red dots (\\"RR\\") counts as one fault. - Since each group of RR is followed by BB, there are no two blue dots exactly two apart. To determine how many faults result from this configuration, we count the number of (RR) pairs: [ text{Number of RR pairs} = frac{1000}{4} times 1 = 250 ] This is because in every 4 consecutive dots (\\"RRBB\\"), there is exactly one pair of \\"RR\\". 2. **Optimality Proof - Blocks of Five Dots:** To show that every possible configuration contains at least 250 faults, consider the following proof: - Divide the 1000 dots into overlapping blocks of 5 consecutive dots. - Each overlapping block shares exactly one dot with the next block. There are 250 such blocks because the overlap is (1000 / 5) = 200 plus (1). [ text{For each block of 5 consecutive dots:} ] [ begin{cases} text{If any of the middle 3 dots are red:} & text{Either:} begin{cases} text{The middle red dot has a red neighbor,} & text{or} text{Both its neighbors are blue,} & text{resulting in a RR or B-R dot arrangement} end{cases} text{If none of the middle 3 dots are red:} & text{All middle 3 dots are blue, meaning two blue dots are 2 apart}. end{cases} ] Therefore, each block of 5 consecutive dots contains at least one fault. Also, since the faults are paired dots and no fault is counted twice due to the overlap, there are at least 250 faults. 3. **Alternative Proof - Non-overlapping Blocks:** An alternative argument involves dividing the 1000 dots into non-overlapping blocks of 4 dots: - Each block either contains an \\"internal fault\\" such as adjacent RR or BB two apart. - If a block is \\"RBRB\\" or \\"RBBR\\", it generates an external fault when combined with adjacent blocks. Since we have 250 blocks, and each must contribute at least 1 fault (internal or external), this logic also guarantees at least 250 faults. 4. **Configuration with Minimum Faults and Termination of Adjustments:** Another approach confirms that we cannot reduce the number of blocks of the same color: - Assuming no more than two consecutive dots of the same color minimizes the total faults. - Rearranging any groups of three or more consecutive red or blue through the above procedure confirms all such groups become length 1 or 2.

The total number of goals after five matches can be calculated by multiplying the new average by the number of matches, which is 5: Total goals after five matches = 5 * (x + 0.3) We also know that the total goals after five matches is the sum of the goals scored in the first four matches (4x) and the goals scored in the fifth match (2): Total goals after five matches = 4x + 2 Now we can set these two expressions equal to each other: 5 * (x + 0.3) = 4x + 2 Expanding the left side, we get: 5x + 1.5 = 4x + 2 Now, we can solve for x: 5x - 4x = 2 - 1.5 x = 0.5 This means the average number of goals before the fifth match was 0.5.

Similarly, for l_2, the slope is frac{3}{m}. Since the two lines are parallel, their slopes must be equal. Hence, we have: frac{m-2}{1} = frac{3}{m}.

Let's start by understanding the problem and the given conditions: We are tasked with proving that for tangents drawn to the parabola x^2 = 4y, which are perpendicular to each other, the relationship a^4 b^4 = (a^2 + b^2)^3 holds for the lengths a and b of the perpendicular tangents. 2. According to the given explanation, in the KőMaL problem F. 3026, it was proven that the tangents drawn to a parabola through its focus are perpendicular to each other and that their point of intersection lies on the directrix of the parabola. 3. We'll first show the reverse: if the tangents at points A and B on the parabola are perpendicular, then the chord AB passes through the focus of the parabola. 4. Suppose points A and \`B\` are the points of tangency where each tangent is perpendicular to the other (see Figure 1). Let the tangent at A intersect the directrix at point \`P\`, and let the line AF intersect the parabola again at B'. According to F. 3026, the tangent at B' intersects the tangent at A at point \`P\` and they are perpendicular to each other. 5. Since the tangent at point \`B\` is also perpendicular to AP, but a parabola doesn't have two parallel tangents, we conclude that B equiv B'. Therefore, the chord AB passes through the focus F, and the perpendicular tangents intersect on the directrix. 6. These tangents form right triangles with AF = AD due to symmetry, and we know AP bisects the angle angle FAD by properties of the parabola. Therefore, Delta ADP cong Delta AFP, implying that angle AFP = 90^circ. 7. Let’s assume a and b are the lengths of the tangents. So we have: a^2 + b^2 = AB^2 Therefore, we need to show that: a^4 b^4 = AB^6 8. Consider the area of Delta APB. Twice the area can be calculated as 2 times text{Area} = a cdot b = AB cdot PF, leading to: left(2 times text{Area}right)^4 = a^4 b^4 = AB^4 cdot PF^4 From this and our requirement, it means we must have: AB^4 cdot PF^4 = AB^6 9. Therefore, we get: PF^2 = AB 10. To verify this, use the height theorem in the right-angled triangle Delta ABP: PF^2 = AF cdot FB Since AB = AF + FB, we need to show: AF cdot FB = (AF + FB)^2 = AB 11. This equation simplifies to: (AF - 1)(FB - 1) = 1 12. Using the coordinates and properties of the points on the parabola, let the coordinates of A and B be (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) respectively. Given the directrix equation y = -1and from the given equation for the parabola x^2 = 4y, we have AD = 1 + frac{1}{4}x_1^2 and BC = 1 + frac{1}{4}x_2^2. 13. Substituting these into the height theorem equation gives: left(frac{1}{4} x_1^2 + 1 - 1right)left(frac{1}{4} x_2^2 + 1 - 1right) = 1 left(frac{1}{4} x_1^2right)left(frac{1}{4} x_2^2right) =1 frac{1}{16} x_1^2 x_2^2 = 1 x_1^2 x_2^2 = 16 14.

This is because the wheel rolls without slipping, meaning the horizontal distance traveled by the center of the wheel (CC') is equal to the distance traveled by point P (PP'). 5. **Conclude the Distance Traveled by the Center**: Since the distance PP' is 2pitext{ m}, the distance traveled by the center of the wheel, CC', is also 2pitext{ m}.

Step 1: Determine (D(h)) For David to flip exactly (h) heads, he must flip (h) heads followed by a tail. [ D(h) = (text{Probability of flipping (h) heads}) times (text{Probability of flipping a tail}) ] [ = left(frac{1}{2}right)^h times left(frac{1}{2}right) = frac{1}{2^{h+1}} ] Step 2: Determine (E(h)) Evan must end with the sequence **TT**, and before these (2) consecutive tails, he flips a valid sequence that does not contain (TT). 1. If (h = 0) (i.e., Evan gets **TT** immediately): [ E(0) = frac{1}{4} ] 2. For (h > 0), (E(h)) can be calculated by considering valid sequences ending with HTT. Let the sequence before HTT be (h) heads and some number of tails. For instance, the valid sequences without including the last **TT** might look like different combinations of heads and tails but their ending must be **HTT**. We calculate the probability as follows: Firstly, the sequence ends with HTT. The probability of HTT is: [ frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{8} ] Ignoring the last **HTT**, the chance of having (h) heads before any (T) breaks the sequence (i.e. no two (T)'s): [ sum_{n=0}^{h} 2^{-n} binom{h}{n} ] The simplified version of the interior sum conclusions: [ sum_{n=0}^{h} binom{h}{n} (1/2)^n = left(frac{3}{4}right)^h ] Then, [ E(h) = frac{3^h}{4^{h+1}} ] Step 3: Calculate David flipping more heads than Evan David flips more heads than Evan if: [ sum_{n=0}^{infty} E(n) sum_{m=n+1}^{infty} D(m) ] Substituting values: 1.

As the sequence ( x_n ) is strictly increasing, it follows ( x_{101} > 1 ) implying: [ frac{1}{x_{101}} < 1 ] 12. Hence, the value of the whole expression: [ frac{1}{x_1} - frac{1}{x_{101}} = 2 - frac{1}{x_{101}} ] 13. Since ( frac{1}{x_{101}} < 1 ), it follows ( 2 - frac{1}{x_{101}} ) is slightly less than 2 but greater than 1.

The minimum value of f(x) is thus f(1) = 1. Given that the minimum value is in the range [1, b], the range begins at 1. The function f(x) is an upwards-opening parabola because the coefficient of x^2 is positive. Therefore, as x increases from 1 to b, f(x) also increases, making f(x) an increasing function on the interval. This implies that the maximum value of f(x) on the interval [1, b] would occur at x = b. Thus, we can set f(b) equal to b because f(b) is the maximum value of f(x) on the interval [1, b] and must belong to the range [1, b]. Setting these equal gives us: f(b) = b^2 - 2b + 2 = b Now we solve for b: begin{align*} b^2 - 2b + 2 &= b b^2 - 3b + 2 &= 0 end{align*} This is a quadratic equation which we can factor: (b - 1)(b - 2) = 0 Thus, b = 1 or b = 2.

A circle centered at A with radius AB intersects line segment BC at points B and X. We need to find the length of BC, which is BX + CX, where both must be integers. Step 2: Applying Power of a Point Theorem Using the Power of a Point theorem at point C on line BC with respect to circle A, we derive: [ CX cdot BC = CD cdot CE ] where D and E are the intersections of the circle with line AC. Since AD = AE = AB = 75, we have: [ CD = AC - AD = 100 - 75 = 25 ] [ CE = AC + AE = 100 + 75 = 175 ] Thus, the equation simplifies to: [ CX cdot (CX + BX) = 25 cdot 175 ] [ CX cdot (CX + BX) = 4375 ] Step 3: Factoring and Analyzing the Equation The prime factorization of 4375 is 5^4 cdot 7.

A certain tourist shop purchased a certain type of Asian Games mascot at a price of 50 yuan per item and sold it at a price of 80 yuan per item. They were able to sell 200 items per day. Starting from July, the store decided to use price reductions to promote sales. Through experiments, it was found that for every 1 yuan reduction in price, the daily sales volume would increase by 20 items. (1) Let the set price be x yuan and the daily sales volume be y items. Express y in terms of x, y=______; (2) At what price should the mascot be sold so that the daily sales profit reaches 7500 yuan? (3) Calculate the pricing strategy that would maximize the daily sales profit.","completion":"# Step-by-Step Solution Part 1: Expressing y in terms of x Given that the initial sales volume is 200 items per day at a price of 80 yuan, and for every 1 yuan reduction in price, the daily sales volume increases by 20 items, we can express the relationship between the price x and the sales volume y as follows: - The price reduction from 80 yuan is (80 - x) yuan. - For every 1 yuan reduction, the sales volume increases by 20 items, so the total increase in sales volume is 20(80 - x) items. - Therefore, the daily sales volume y can be expressed as the initial sales volume plus the increase in sales volume, which is 200 + 20(80 - x). Simplifying this expression gives us: [y = 200 + 20(80 - x) = 200 + 1600 - 20x = -20x + 1800] So, the expression for y in terms of x is boxed{-20x + 1800}. Part 2: Pricing for 7500 Yuan Daily Sales Profit To achieve a daily sales profit of 7500 yuan, we set up the equation based on the profit formula, which is the selling price minus the cost price (x - 50) times the sales volume (-20x + 1800): [(x - 50)(-20x + 1800) = 7500] Expanding and simplifying this equation gives us: [x^2 - 140x + 4875 = 0] Solving this quadratic equation, we find the roots to be x_1 = 65 and x_2 = 75. Thus, the mascot should be sold at boxed{65 text{ yuan or } 75 text{ yuan}} to achieve a daily sales profit of 7500 yuan. Part 3: Maximizing Daily Sales Profit To find the pricing strategy that maximizes the daily sales profit W, we express W in terms of x: [W = (x - 50)(-20x + 1800) = -20(x^2 - 90x + 1800)] Completing the square for the quadratic expression gives us: [W = -20(x - 70)^2 + 8000] Since the coefficient of the squared term is negative (-20 < 0), the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the maximum value of W occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 70.

As there are 3 cultural classes to arrange, there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange them in sequence (Chinese, Mathematics, Foreign Language).

The total number of arrangements for this scenario is the product of the two, which is 6 times 6 = 36. 2. Insert one art class into one of the two spaces and have two consecutive cultural classes without an art class between them. This can happen in two ways (either the first space is filled with an art class or the second one is filled). For the filled space, there are 3 options for which art class to choose. For the empty space, we now consider the bundle of 2 consecutive cultural classes and the remaining 2 art classes together, giving us 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24 arrangements.

To achieve this, we'll use a specific lemma about primes congruent to 3 modulo 4. Lemma Let (p equiv 3 pmod{4}) be a prime dividing a number of the form (a^2 + b^2) where (a) and (b) are integers. Then (p mid a) and (p mid b). # Proof of Lemma: 1. Assume (a) and (b) are coprime with (p), i.e., (gcd(a, p) = 1) and (gcd(b, p) = 1). 2. Under this assumption, (a^2 equiv -b^2 pmod{p}), which implies: [ left(frac{a}{b}right)^2 equiv -1 pmod{p}. ] 3. Let (c equiv frac{a}{b} pmod{p}), then: [ c^2 equiv -1 pmod{p}. ] 4. Raising both sides to the power (2), we get: [ c^4 equiv 1 pmod{p}. ] Hence, the order of (c pmod{p}) divides 4, but since (p equiv 3 pmod{4}), the only valid order is 4. 5. This would imply (4 mid (p-1)), contradicting (p equiv 3 pmod{4}). 6. Therefore, our initial assumption that (a) and (b) are coprime with (p) is false, meaning (p mid a) and (p mid b). Hence, we conclude that primes dividing (b^2 + 1) are of the form (4k + 1). Main Solution: Given the above lemma, we must find (a) such that both (a) and (a+1) have only prime factors of the form (4k + 1). 1. Consider the form (a = (4k^2 + 1)^2), and examine (a) and (a + 1): - (a = (4k^2 + 1)^2) - (a + 1 = (4k^2 + 1)^2 + 1) 2. Both (a) and (a + 1) should be checked for prime factors. Since (4k^2 + 1) is always congruent to (1 pmod{4}), (a) and (a+1) will also have factors congruent to (1 pmod{4}). 3. Next, it is essential to verify that (b) can be found such that (b^2 equiv -1 pmod{q_i^{alpha_i}}) for all prime factors (q_i) of (a(a+1)). By Hensel’s lemma, we proceed by induction on (alpha_i): - Assume we have (y_i) such that (y_i^2 equiv -1 pmod{q_i^{alpha_i}}). - For (alpha_i + 1), consider (y_i + k q_i^{alpha_i}): [ (y_i + k q_i^{alpha_i})^2 equiv y_i^2 + 2 y_i k q_i^{alpha_i} + k^2 q_i^{2alpha_i} pmod{q_i^{alpha_i + 1}}. ] - By choosing (k) such that (2 y_i k + k^{prime} equiv 0 pmod{q_i}), there exists a (b_i) for each (q_i). 4. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), we find an integer (b) such that (b^2 equiv -1 pmod{a(a+1)}). # Conclusion: By constructing integers (a) of the form ((4k^2 + 1)^2) and corresponding (b) as derived by CRT, we can ensure (a(a + 1) mid b^2 + 1).

We start with the given functional equation for the polynomial ( P(t) ): [ P(x^2 - y^2) = P(x + y)P(x - y) ] for all real numbers ( x ) and ( y ). 2. Notice that ( x^2 - y^2 ) can be factored as: [ x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) ] This suggests that we can rewrite the functional equation in terms of the product of sums and differences of ( x ) and ( y ). 3. To explore the solutions, let's consider specific values for ( x ) and ( y ). First, set ( y = 0 ): [ P(x^2) = P(x)P(x) ] This simplifies to: [ P(x^2) = P(x)^2 ] 4. Next, set ( x = 0 ): [ P(-y^2) = P(y)P(-y) ] Since ( P(t) ) is a polynomial, it must be even or odd. If ( P(t) ) is even, then ( P(-y) = P(y) ). If ( P(t) ) is odd, then ( P(-y) = -P(y) ). 5. Consider the polynomial ( P(t) ) of degree ( n ). Suppose ( P(t) = a_n t^n + a_{n-1} t^{n-1} + cdots + a_1 t + a_0 ). From the equation ( P(x^2) = P(x)^2 ), we can infer that the degree of ( P(x^2) ) is ( 2n ) and the degree of ( P(x)^2 ) is ( 2n ). Therefore, the degree of ( P(t) ) must be consistent with this relationship. 6. If ( P(t) ) is a non-zero polynomial, the simplest non-trivial solution is ( P(t) = t^n ). Let's verify this: [ P(x^2 - y^2) = (x^2 - y^2)^n ] and [ P(x + y)P(x - y) = (x + y)^n (x - y)^n = (x^2 - y^2)^n ] Both sides match, confirming that ( P(t) = t^n ) is a solution. 7. Additionally, the zero polynomial ( P(t) = 0 ) and the constant polynomial ( P(t) = 1 ) also satisfy the given functional equation: [ P(x^2 - y^2) = 0 = 0 cdot 0 ] and [ P(x^2 - y^2) = 1 = 1 cdot 1 ] 8. Therefore, the polynomials that satisfy the given functional equation are ( P(t) = 0 ), ( P(t) = 1 ), and ( P(t) = t^n ) for any non-negative integer ( n ).

The problem asks whether there exists an n such that n cdot s(n) = 20222022. 2. **Divisibility Rules**: First, let's quickly review the relevant divisibility rules: - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. - A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. 3. **Divisibility of 20222022**: Let's check the sum of the digits of 20222022: [ 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 2 = 12 ] Since 12 is divisible by 3, 20222022 is also divisible by 3.

Firstly, since f(x) is a logarithmic function with base a, the function is only well-defined if a > 0 and a neq 1. For f(x) = log_a (8-ax) to be decreasing on [0,2], the argument of the logarithm, t = 8 - ax, must itself be a decreasing function on [0,2]. This condition ensures that t remains positive on the interval so that the logarithm is defined. Since we are given that f(x) is decreasing, depending on the base a of the logarithm, the nature of the decrease is influenced. If a > 1, the logarithmic function is increasing with its argument; hence, for f(x) to be decreasing, t = 8 - ax must be decreasing. Thus, we derive the inequality -a < 0, or equivalently, a > 0. Furthermore, we require that for x = 2, the argument remains positive, which means 8 - 2a > 0. Solving this inequality gives us a < 4.

The formula for simple interest (SI) is: SI = (P × R × T) / 100 Where P is the principal amount (face value of the bill), R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years. Since the banker's discount is the simple interest on the face value for 5 years, we can write: BD = (FV × 15 × 5) / 100 Now, the true discount (TD) is the present value (PV) of the banker's gain, which can be calculated using the formula for present value of simple interest: PV = SI / (1 + (R × T) / 100) In this case, the simple interest is the banker's gain (BG), so we can write: TD = BG / (1 + (15 × 5) / 100) We know that BG is Rs. 500, so we can substitute this value into the equation: TD = 500 / (1 + (15 × 5) / 100) TD = 500 / (1 + 0.75) TD = 500 / 1.75 TD = 285.71 (approximately) Now we have the value of TD, we can find the banker's discount (BD) using the first equation: BD = TD + BG BD = 285.71 + 500 BD = Rs. 785.71 (approximately) Therefore, the banker's discount is approximately Rs. boxed{785.71} ."},{"prompt":"f x=1, the value of the algebraic expression ax^3+bx+1 is 5, then when x=1, the value of the algebraic expression ax^3+bx+1 equals to.","completion":"Given that when x=1, the value of the algebraic expression ax^3+bx+1 is 5, therefore a+b+1=5, which simplifies to a+b=4.

The cost is 0.25 per minute, and there were 12 minutes of waiting time, so the cost for waiting time is 12 * 0.25 = 3.00. Next, we add the toll fees, which are 3.00. So far, the total cost without surge pricing is 2.50 (first 1/5 mile) + 15.60 (remaining distance) + 3.00 (waiting time) + 3.00 (toll fees) = 24.10. Now, we need to calculate the surge pricing, which is 20% of the total cost so far. The surge pricing would be 20% of 24.10, which is 0.20 * 24.10 = 4.82. Finally, we add the surge pricing to the total cost to get the final cost of the taxi ride: 24.10 (total cost without surge) + 4.82 (surge pricing) = 28.92.

For this sequence: - a_{3} = {(-1)}^3 cdot 3 = -3 - a_{5} = {(-1)}^5 cdot 5 = -5 - a_{7} = {(-1)}^7 cdot 7 = -7 Thus, we find that a_{3} + a_{7} = -3 + (-7) = -10 and 2a_{5} = 2 cdot (-5) = -10. So, a_{3} + a_{7} = 2a_{5} holds true for this sequence. However, the sequence {a_{n}} defined as a_n = {(-1)}^n cdot n is not an arithmetic sequence because the difference between consecutive terms is not constant. 2. **Verifying the condition for an arithmetic sequence:** If {a_{n}} is indeed an arithmetic sequence, then by the properties of arithmetic sequences, the condition a_{3} + a_{7} = 2a_{5} must hold. This is because in an arithmetic sequence, the average of a_{3} and a_{7} (which is frac{a_{3} + a_{7}}{2}) is equal to a_{5}, the term exactly in the middle of a_{3} and a_{7}. This property is a direct result of the definition of an arithmetic sequence, where each term is obtained by adding a constant difference to the previous term. From these observations, we conclude that while the condition \\"a_{3}+a_{7}=2a_{5}\\" can be satisfied by a non-arithmetic sequence (as shown in the first scenario), it is always satisfied by an arithmetic sequence (as explained in the second scenario). Therefore, the condition is necessary (since it must be true for the sequence to be arithmetic) but not sufficient (since it being true does not guarantee the sequence is arithmetic).

In this case, we can divide both numbers by 0.4 kg to get whole numbers: 28.8 kg ÷ 0.4 kg = 72 35.2 kg ÷ 0.4 kg = 88 So the simplified ratio of zinc to copper in the mixture is 72:88.

Thus, several different times can correspond to the same photograph (for example, 1:15, 10:45, and 22:45 all look the same as shown on the right). A robot takes several photographs of the clock over one day (from 0:00 to 24:00). It remembers the order in which the photographs were taken but not the exact time. Sometimes, from such a series of photographs, it is possible to determine the exact time of some of them; such photographs are called certain. If there are multiple possible times from the series of photographs for a specific image, it is called uncertain. For example, in the series of photographs shown on the right, photograph No. 2 is certain (it was taken at 9:00), whereas photograph No. 4 is uncertain (it could be taken at either 16:00 or 20:00). Given a series of 100 photographs taken within one day, none of which look identical and none of which are taken at 0:00, 6:00, 12:00, 18:00, or 24:00, what is the minimum number of uncertain photographs among them?","completion":"Let's carefully analyze the problem and provide a detailed solution step by step. We need to determine the minimal number of undefined photographs in a series of 100 photographs. 1. **Understanding the Clock Symmetry**: Each photograph shows either: - The actual time. - A time symmetrically reflected about the 12-hour mark (for example, 1:00 and 11:00). - A 12-hour shifted version of the above options (like 1:00 and 13:00 or 23:00 respectively). Therefore, for each given photograph, there are four possible times it might represent owing to the 12-hour cycle and the vertical reflection: - ( t ) - ( 12 - t ) - ( 12 + t ) - ( 24 - t ) 2. **Conditions Given**: - The series of photographs spans 24 hours. - No photograph is taken at 0:00 (midnight), 6:00 (early morning), 12:00 (noon), 18:00 (evening), or 24:00 (midnight). - No two photographs look identical. 3. **Assigning Times to Photographs**: We are provided an example series of times: 5:50, 11:40, 17:30, and times within the interval from 20:00 to 23:00. Given that no two photographs look the same and the clock's constraints, most photographs can be definitively assigned a time. 4. **Minimization Strategy**: We need to find how many photographs are left undefined. We will illustrate this with the example provided in the problem statement: - Assign the times to the provided hours, ensuring non-identical appearances. - Check for defined and undefined photographs. 5. **Example of Definite and Undefined Photographs**: Suppose the photographs taken are at 5:50, 11:40, 17:30, and ones between 20:00 to 23:00. Now, let's break it down: - **First Photograph at 5:50**: - Reflection: 6:10 (which we exclude since it's close to a forbidden time) - Shift (if applicable) considerations won’t overlap standard times I can control using given times. - **Second Photograph at 11:40**: - Reflection considered: 12:20 (again managed within exclusions) - Similarly checked for overlaps with existing recorded times. - **Third Photograph at 17:30**: - Checked with previous validations. - For photographs between 20:00 to 23:00: Checked and validated with non-repetition criteria. 6. **Conclusion**: After the above steps, we will find that exactly three photographs can be undefined. This is derived by seeing how rotations and reflections keep them from being conclusive beyond the possible clock duplications.

Given: a_4 + a_8 = 4, Since a_4 and a_8 are equidistant from a_6 in an arithmetic sequence, we can use the property that the sum of terms equidistant from the middle term is constant. Thus: 2a_6 = a_4 + a_8 = 4, which implies: a_6 = frac{4}{2} = 2. To find S_{11}, which is the sum of the first 11 terms, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S_{11} = frac{11}{2}(a_1 + a_{11}). Since we've found a_6, we can use the fact that a_{11} is five terms away from a_6. In an arithmetic sequence, the terms increase or decrease at a constant rate; let's call this common difference d.

We aim to show that all 100 points lie on the graph of the same quadratic polynomial. 2. **Uniqueness of the Quadratic Polynomial:** Let us consider points A, B, C, and D lying on the graph of a quadratic polynomial f(x), i.e., [ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ] where a, b, and c are constants determined by the coordinates of points A, B, C, and D. 3. **Polynomial Constraints:** Since f(x) is a quadratic polynomial and it passes through four points A, B, C, and D: [ f(x_A) = y_A, quad f(x_B) = y_B, quad f(x_C) = y_C, quad f(x_D) = y_D ] 4. **Reduction to Checking Other Points:** We need to consider any remaining point, say point E. Suppose g(x) is another quadratic polynomial that passes through points A, B, C, and E. So: [ g(x) = a'x^2 + b'x + c' ] 5. **Difference Polynomial:** Define h(x) = f(x) - g(x). Since both f and g are quadratic polynomials, h(x) is also a quadratic polynomial: [ h(x) = (a - a')x^2 + (b - b')x + (c - c') ] This simplifies to: [ h(x) = dx^2 + ex + f ] where d, e, and f are differences of coefficients of f(x) and g(x). 6. **Roots of the Difference Polynomial:** Since f and g pass through points A, B, and C, it follows that: [ h(x_A) = 0, quad h(x_B) = 0, quad h(x_C) = 0 ] That means h(x) has three roots. However, a non-zero quadratic polynomial can have at most two roots. Hence, h(x) must be identically equal to zero: [ h(x) = 0 text{ for all } x ] Therefore, the polynomials f and g must be identical: [ f(x) = g(x) ] 7. **Conclusion for All Points:** Therefore, E must lie on the same polynomial as A, B, C, and D.

We are given two points ( A ) and ( B ) on a plane, and a sequence of points ( C_1 = C, C_2, C_3, ldots ), where ( C_{n+1} ) is the center of the circumcircle of triangle ( ABC_n ). We need to determine the conditions under which ( C_n ) falls into specified positions. 2. Let ( angle C_nBA = angle C_nAB = alpha_n ). For any triangle ( ABC_n ), the relationship between the angles ( alpha_n ) and ( alpha_{n+1} ) can be established depending on whether the triangle is acute or obtuse: - For an acute triangle, the angle relationship is ( alpha_{n+1} = 2alpha_n - frac{pi}{2} ) where ( frac{pi}{4} < alpha_n < frac{pi}{2} ). - For an obtuse triangle, the angle relationship is ( alpha_{n+1} = frac{pi}{2} - 2alpha_n ) where ( 0 < alpha_n < frac{pi}{4} ). 3. This relationship can be unified into one formula: [ alpha_{n+1} = left| 2alpha_n - frac{pi}{2} right|, quad 0 < alpha_n < frac{pi}{2} ] For any triangle, if ( alpha_n = frac{pi}{4} ), then ( alpha_{n+1} = 0 ), indicating that ( C_{n+1} ) falls exactly at the midpoint of segment ( AB ). 4. Introducing ( x_n = frac{2alpha_n}{pi} ), the transformation can be described by the function ( f(x) = |2x - 1| ), where ( x in [0,1] ). Thus, we consider: [ x_{n+1} = f(x_n) = |2x_n - 1| ] 5. Let us analyze the behavior of the function ( f(x) ): - ( f(x) ) maps the interval ( [0, 1] ) onto itself. - ( f(0) = f(1) = 1 ) and ( fleft( frac{1}{2} right) = 0 ). 6. Each segment ( [0, frac{1}{2}] ) and ( [frac{1}{2}, 1] ) is stretched and mapped back onto the entire interval ( [0, 1] ). This shows how ( f^n ) effectively folds these intervals ( n ) times over. 7. The function ( f(x) ) has the property that each time it is applied, it stretches and reflects the segment into parts, creating a denser interval with each iteration. 8. To solve ( f^n(x) = 0 ), which corresponds to ( C_n ) falling at the midpoint of ( AB ), recognize that the solutions are of the form ( x = frac{p}{2^n} ), where ( p ) is an odd number. This gives: [ alpha_n = p cdot frac{pi}{2^{n+1}}, quad text{where ( p ) is an odd natural number with ( p < 2^n )}. ] 9. For the fixed point ( C_n ) coinciding with ( C ), we solve ( f^n(x) = x ).

He was moving with a total weight of 525 kg. What is the ratio of the weight of the vest to Tom's weight?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total weight Tom is holding in his hands. Since he can hold 1.5 times his weight in each hand, we multiply his weight by 1.5 for each hand: 150 kg * 1.5 = 225 kg per hand Since he holds this amount in each hand, we multiply by 2: 225 kg/hand * 2 hands = 450 kg Now, we know the total weight Tom is moving with is 525 kg. This includes his own weight, the weight he's holding in his hands, and the weight of the vest. To find the weight of the vest, we subtract Tom's weight and the weight he's holding in his hands from the total weight: 525 kg (total weight) - 450 kg (weight in hands) - 150 kg (Tom's weight) = 525 kg - 600 kg = -75 kg This result doesn't make sense because the weight of the vest cannot be negative.

Step 2: Visualize the pyramid For a pyramid with a square base, four triangular faces are required. Each square edge connects to only one triangle. Thus, to form such a pyramid, the additional square must configure with the central square and support creating a height-forming edge. Step 3: Analyze positions for the additional square - **Positions at the Middle of the Arms (4 possible positions)**: If the square is added perpendicular to any middle arm, it would seamlessly elevate to form a triangular face between the base and the added square. All four positions involved with the middle of the arms are valid. - **Positions on the Corners or Adjacent to Central Square (4 possible positions)**: Squares added here will either interfere with proper base formation or will not contribute effectively to the height necessary to form a triangular side. Step 4: Count valid configurations Only the squares added in the middle of each arm permit forming the required pyramid shape while adhering to the constraints, leading to a total of 4 valid positions.

Begin by considering a given triangle ( triangle ABC ). To find the geometric locus of the centers of equilateral triangles inscribed around (triangle ABC), we need to define supporting structures within the geometry. 2. Imagine constructing arcs of (120^circ) centered at each vertex of (triangle ABC). These arcs are oriented such that they bend inward towards the triangle. Essentially, these arcs will form part of the outline of potential equilateral triangles. 3. To find the locus of the centers of these equilateral triangles, we need to focus on the relationship between point centers and the geometric transformations involved with (120^circ) rotations. 4. Each side of (triangle ABC) can be treated as a base for constructing an equilateral triangle. Take, for instance, side (AB). When an equilateral triangle is constructed on (AB), the center (circumcenter) of this equilateral triangle will be equidistant from (A) and (B), lying along the perpendicular bisector of (AB), rotated by (90^circ + 30^circ). In complex plane terms, if (A = z_1) and (B = z_2), the center (C_{AB}) of the equilateral triangle constructed on (AB) can be expressed as: [C_{AB} = frac{z_1 + z_2}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}i (z_1 - z_2)] 5. Repeat this process for the other two sides, (BC) and (CA): [C_{BC} = frac{z_2 + z_3}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}i (z_2 - z_3)] [C_{CA} = frac{z_3 + z_1}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}i (z_3 - z_1)] 6. Since the centers of the equilateral triangles constructed on each side of (triangle ABC) must lie along the circle that passes through these points (which are the midpoints of each arc), we can conclude that the geometric locus of all these centers forms the circle. 7. Finally, we draw the circle that passes through the midpoints of the (120^circ) arcs constructed on each side of the triangle. The center of this circle is the geometric locus of all possible centers of right equilateral triangles described around (triangle ABC).

To find how many integers from 1 to 2019 inclusive, when added to 8866, result in at least one carryover, we will start by analyzing the problem step-by-step. 2. Observe the number 8866. It has the digits 8, 8, 6, and 6. We’ll work from the rightmost digit to the leftmost digit. 3. First, we consider the units digit: - A carryover happens if the sum of the units digit of our number and 6 (the units digit of 8866) exceeds 9. This means the units digit must be at least 4. - Hence, the units digits that result in a carry are {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 4. Continuing to the tens digit: - Similarly, adding to the tens digit of 8866, which is 6, causes a carry if our tens digit ≥ 4. - Thus, the tens digits that result in a carry are also {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 5. For the hundreds digit: - Adding perspective to the hundreds digit of our number results in a carryover if our digit + 8 (from 8866) > 9, which is for digits {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 6. For the thousands place: - The carry occurs for numbers where our digit + 8 (the thousands digit in 8866) > 9, corresponding to digits {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. 7. Now we quantify how many such numbers exist within the range from 1 to 2019. 8. The total number count ranges from 1000 to 1999: - When this count spanning 1 to 999, 1000 to 1999, combine with the described valid digits for positioning: It would generate the substantial carryover rules in arithmetic basis. 9.

The radical axis of two circles is the locus of points that have equal power with respect to both circles.

Similarly, we have radical axes for the pairs ((C_1, C_3)) and ((C_2, C_3)). 2. **Intersection of Radical Axes:** The radical axes of the three pairs of circles intersect at a single point, known as the radical center. This point (R) is equidistant from the points of tangency of the internal common tangents of the circles. 3. **Perpendiculars and Angle Bisectors:** The perpendiculars from (A) to (O_2O_3), from (B) to (O_1O_2), and from (C) to (O_1O_3) are the radical axes of the circles and hence meet at the radical center (R). These perpendiculars are also the angle bisectors of (angle B'AC'), (angle C'BA'), and (angle A'CB') respectively. 4. **Inscribed Circle:** Since the perpendiculars are the angle bisectors, the point (R) is the incenter of the hexagon (ABCA'B'C').

(a) What is the maximum grade that student Ivanov can achieve in economics? (b) Explain why the final grade in economics reflects the teacher's opinion that it is extremely important to know both microeconomics and macroeconomics.

(a) Finding the Maximum Final Score: 1. **Define Variables:** Let ( x ) be the time units spent on microeconomics and ( y ) the time units spent on macroeconomics. [ x + y = 4.6 ] 2. **Expressions for Scores:** The scores for microeconomics and macroeconomics are given by: [ O_{text{micro}} = 2.5x ] [ O_{text{macro}} = 1.5y ] 3. **Weighted Averages:** [ A = 0.25O_{text{micro}} + 0.75O_{text{macro}} = 0.25(2.5x) + 0.75(1.5y) = 0.625x + 1.125y ] [ B = 0.75O_{text{micro}} + 0.25O_{text{macro}} = 0.75(2.5x) + 0.25(1.5y) = 1.875x + 0.375y ] 4. **Setting the Minimum:** To maximize the final score, we need the minimum of A and B: [ min(A, B) ] 5. **Finding Equal Point:** To find the time distribution that balances the scores, we set A equal to B: [ 0.625x + 1.125y = 1.875x + 0.375y ] Simplify and solve for ( y ): [ 1.125y - 0.375y = 1.875x - 0.625x ] [ 0.75y = 1.25x ] [ y = frac{5}{3}x ] 6. **Substituting the Constraint:** Using the constraint ( x + y = 4.6 ): [ x + frac{5}{3}x = 4.6 ] [ frac{8}{3}x = 4.6 ] [ x = 4.6 times frac{3}{8} ] [ x = 1.725 ] [ y = 4.6 - 1.725 ] [ y = 2.875 ] 7. **Calculate Final Scores:** [ O_{text{micro}} = 2.5 times 1.725 = 4.3125 ] [ O_{text{macro}} = 1.5 times 2.875 = 4.3125 ] 8. **Calculate the Maximum Score:** Since both expressions for the final score are balanced, [ A = B = min left(0.625 times 1.725 + 1.125 times 2.875, 1.875 times 1.725 + 0.375 times 2.875 right) = 4.3125 ] The final score is 4.31, rounded to the nearest whole number: [ boxed{4} ] (b) Explanation: The given grading scheme by the teacher ensures that students must have a balanced understanding of both microeconomics and macroeconomics. This is achieved by taking the minimum of the two weighted scores, which encourages students to allocate some amount of time to both subjects since neglecting either will lower their overall grade. - **Importance of Both Subjects:** If a student spends all their time on one subject, they will get a low score on the other, resulting in a lower final grade due to the minimum criterion. - For instance, if Ivanov allocated all 4.6 time units to either subject, the resulting calculation from the other subject would significantly lower the weighted minimum score. - **Not Always Perfect Representation:** While the minimum criterion ensures a balanced understanding, it might not always perfectly encapsulate the teacher's view if the weightings or effort per time unit required for subjects were different. If the difficulty levels or learning efficiencies varied significantly, a student might still focus more on one subject to maximize scores based on the individual effort-to-score return. In conclusion, the optimal balance in this case results in a final score of 4, which fulfills the criteria set by the teacher and reflects Ivanov's understanding of both microeconomics and macroeconomics.

The total capacity of the area (72 inches) minus the total rain over three days (60 inches) gives us the remaining capacity before the fourth day's rain: 72 inches - 60 inches = 12 inches Since the area overflowed with a minimum of 21 inches of rain on the fourth day, we can calculate the minimum amount of rain that would have caused the overflow: 12 inches (remaining capacity) + 21 inches (fourth day's rain) = 33 inches This means that the area must have been able to drain at least 33 inches over the course of three days to avoid overflowing before the fourth day's rain.

Then, since angle DPF = 90^circ, we see that P is on the Apollonian circle of BC through D. So, the conclusion follows. **Lemma 2.** Triangles BPF and CEP are similar. **Proof.** Invoking the Angle Bisector Theorem with the previous lemma gives: frac{BP}{BF} = frac{BP}{BD} = frac{CP}{CD} = frac{CP}{CE}. But angle BFP = angle CEP, so triangle BFP sim triangle CEP. **Lemma 3.** Quadrilateral BZY C is cyclic; in particular, line YZ is the antiparallel of line BC through angle BAC. **Proof.** Remark that angle YBZ = angle PBF = angle ECP = angle YCZ. **Lemma 4.** The circumcircles of triangles AYZ, AEF, and ABC are concurrent at a point X such that triangle XBF sim triangle XCE. **Proof.** Note that line EF is the angle bisector of angle BPZ = angle CPY. Thus: frac{ZF}{FB} = frac{ZP}{PB} = frac{YP}{PC} = frac{YE}{EC}. Then, if we let X be the Miquel point of quadrilateral ZYCB, it follows that the spiral similarity mapping segment BZ to segment CY maps E to F; therefore the circumcircle of triangle AEF must pass through X too. **Lemma 5.** Ray XP bisects angle FXE. **Proof.** The assertion amounts to: frac{XF}{XE} = frac{BF}{EC} = frac{FP}{PE}. The first equality follows from the spiral similarity triangle BFX sim triangle CEX, while the second is from triangle BFP sim triangle CEP.

Hence, X, P, I are collinear. **Lemma 7.** Points X, Q, I are collinear. **Proof.** On one hand, angle AXQ = 90^circ, because we established earlier that line YZ was antiparallel to line BC through angle A, hence AQ perp BC means exactly that angle AZQ = angle AYQ = 90^circ. On the other hand, angle AXI = 90^circ according to the fact that X lies on the circle with diameter AI.

The intersections are being transformed into twolevel intersections such that one road passes over the other. Show that with an appropriate design of the intersections, it is possible to travel on any road in the country while alternating between crossing the other roads from above and below.","completion":"1. **Problem Restatement:** We must show that in a country where every road is straight, any two roads intersect, and each intersection involves exactly two roads, it is possible to design intersections such that while traveling on any given road you alternately pass over and under the other roads. 2. **Base Case:** For 2 or 3 roads, it is trivially possible to create the required intersection system. Each intersection can have one road passing over the other, which naturally satisfies the condition. 3. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for ( n ) roads, it is possible to design the intersections in the desired way. 4. **Inductive Step:** Consider ( n + 1 ) roads. Label the new road as ( e ), and assume the remaining ( n ) roads already have the desired intersection arrangement according to our inductive hypothesis. 5. **Intersection Without Overlapping:** The ( n ) roads form intersections that do not overlap ( e ), because having an overlapping intersection would imply three roads intersect at the same point, which is not possible by the problem's condition. 6. **Adjusting Half-Plane Intersections:** Split the plane into two half-planes using ( e ). Reverse the designation of \\"above\\" and \\"below\\" for roads on one of these half-planes. This means if road ( f ) was above a point, it now passes below it, and vice versa. 7. **Creating Consistent Intersection ( K ):** For any road ( f ) from the ( n ) roads, create the intersection ( K ) between ( e ) and ( f ) such that ( f ) passes above ( e ) if ( f ) was passing below the neighboring intersections along ( f ). This ensures the alternating pattern continues. 8. **Verification:** For intersections ( A ) and ( B ) on ( e ) separated by ( f ) and ( g ), with ( C ) being their intersection, ensure ( A ) and ( B ) are of opposite types. The argument is that this follows directly from how intersections within the ( n ) roads are managed and the alternating structure. 9. **Details of Validation:** - There are an equal number of intersections on the segments ( AC ) and ( BC ). - An edge like segment ( AB ) does get intersected by any further paths considering ( f ) and ( g ) remain consistent.

That is, for all non-negative x, f(x+2) = f(x). Next, because f(x) is an even function, this implies that f(-x) = f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. To find f(-2014), we can use the fact that f(x) is an even function: f(-2014) = f(2014). Since 2014 is an even number, it can be expressed as 2014 = 2 times 1007, and by the periodicity of f(x): f(2014) = f(2 times 1007) = f(0). When x in [0, 2), f(x) = x^2 - x + 1, thus: f(0) = 0^2 - 0 + 1 = 1. For f(1), since 1 is also in the interval [0, 2): f(1) = 1^2 - 1 + 1 = 1.

First, let's consider the smallest value of ( n ) which is ( n = 1 ): 1. Here, we only have two numbers: ( 1 ) and ( 2 ). 2. The sum ( 1 + 2 = 3 ) is not a perfect square. So ( n = 1 ) does not satisfy the condition. Now, let us assume ( n > 1 ). Method 1: For any ( n > 1 ), we can partition the numbers into groups of four consecutive numbers and, if necessary, groups of six consecutive numbers. 1. **Groups of Four Consecutive Numbers:** - Consider a set of four consecutive numbers: ( a, a+1, a+2, a+3 ). - Pair them as ( (a, a+3) ) and ( (a+1, a+2) ). - Sum of the pairs: ( a + (a+3) = 2a + 3 ) and ( (a+1) + (a+2) = 2a + 3 ). - Multiplying these sums together gives ( (2a + 3)^2 ), which is a perfect square. 2. **Groups of Six Consecutive Numbers:** - To balance any remaining numbers after forming groups of four, consider six consecutive numbers: ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ). - We can pair them as ( (1, 6) ), ( (2, 5) ), and ( (3, 4) ). - Sum of pairs: ( 1 + 6 = 7 ), ( 2 + 5 = 7 ), ( 3 + 4 = 7 ). - Multiplying these sums together gives ( 7^3 = 343 ), which is not suitable. Instead, we could use the pairings differently to make compatible sums that could produce squares like in our initial example. By this method, for any ( n > 1 ), we can group and pair into sums that their product will form a perfect square. Method 2: Let us further generalize this for both even and odd ( n ). 1. **Even ( n ):** - Pair the outermost numbers in sequence, ( (1, 2n), (2, 2n-1), ldots, (n, n+1) ). - The sums of these pairs: ( 1 + 2n, 2 + (2n-1), ldots, n + (n+1) ) each equals ( 2n+1 ). - Number of such pairs: ( n ). - Multiplying these sums gives ( (2n+1)^n ), which is indeed a perfect square. 2. **Odd ( n ):** - Initially pair first six numbers to get ( (1+6), (2+5), (3+4) ), giving sums of ( 7 ). - Remaining numbers make up pairs like even case up to the sequence. - The pairings and sums from the remaining follow the form ( 2n+7 ). - The resulting product shapes up in a way to form ((2n+7)^{n-3}) as per pattern similarly leading to squared outcomes.

Proposed by *Ali Mirzaie*","completion":"1. **Strengthening the Statement**: We start by strengthening the given statement. We aim to show that if ( d > 3 ), ( G ) is a connected simple graph that is not an isolated point, and [ x_d geq x_{d-1} + cdots + (d-2)x_2 + (d-2)x_1 - d, ] and there does not exist a vertex ( v ) with degree ( d ) such that ( G-v ) is connected, then the equality holds and ( G ) has vertices only of degrees ( 1, d-1, d ). 2. **Case ( x_d = 0 )**: We first consider the case when ( x_d = 0 ). In this scenario, we need to show that ( G ) is either an edge or ( K_d ). Let ( n ) be the number of vertices and ( m ) be the number of edges. We have: [ -x_1 + sum_{i=1}^{d-1} (d-i)x_i geq (n-x_1) + (d-2)x_1 = n + (d-3)x_1, ] and [ -x_1 + sum_{i=1}^{d-1} (d-i)x_i geq dn - 2m - x_1 geq dn - (n-x_1)(n-x_1-1) - 3x_1 = n(d + 2x_1 + 1 - n) - x_1^2 - 4x_1. ] We need to deal with the case when ( n + (d-3)x_1 leq d ). 3. **Subcase ( x_1 = 0 )**: If ( x_1 = 0 ), then we have ( n(d+1-n) > d ) unless ( n = 1 ) or ( n = d ). Since ( G ) is not an isolated vertex, we have ( n = d ) and all equalities must hold. This shows that ( G ) is the complete graph on ( d ) vertices, ( K_d ). 4. **Subcase ( x_1 = 1 )**: If ( x_1 = 1 ), then ( n geq 2 ) and: [ n(d + 2x_1 + 1 - n) geq min(2(d+1), 3d) = 2d + 2, ] and so: [ n(d + 2x_1 + 1 - n) - x_1^2 - 4x_1 geq 2d - 3 > d. ] 5. **Subcase ( x_1 = 2 )**: If ( x_1 = 2 ), then ( n + (d-3)x_1 leq d ) implies that ( d = 4 ) and ( n = x_1 = 2 ). Thus: [ n(d + 2x_1 + 1 - n) - x_1^2 - 4x_1 geq 2d - 3 = d. ] In this case, we get an edge. 6. **Subcase ( x_1 geq 3 )**: If ( x_1 geq 3 ), then ( 3(d-2) leq d ), showing that ( d leq 3 ), which is a contradiction. 7. **Induction for Larger ( x_d )**: For larger ( x_d ), we use induction and assume that the above claims hold for smaller ( x_d ). We take an arbitrary vertex ( v ) with degree ( d ) in ( G ). By assumption, ( G-v ) is not connected, so let us assume that ( G-v ) has components ( G_1, ldots, G_k ) where ( k geq 2 ). For each ( G_i ), we add ( v ) back, label this ( v ) as ( v_i ), and call this new graph ( G_i' ). It is clear that there does not exist any ( u in G_i' ) with ( deg u = d ) such that ( G_i' - u ) is connected, for otherwise, we can take this ( u ) in ( G ). 8. **Counting Degrees in Components**: Let ( x^i_j ) be the number of vertices in ( G_i' ) with degree ( j ). Then we can see that: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} x^i_j = x_j - #{i | deg v_i = j} ] if ( j leq d-1 ) and: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} x^i_d = x_d - 1. ] Therefore, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} left( -x^i_d - x^i_1 + sum_{j=1}^{d-1} (d-j)x^i_j right) = -x_d + 1 - x_1 + sum_{j=1}^{d-1} (d-j)x_j - sum_{i=1}^{k} (d - deg(v_i)) - #{i | deg(v_i) = 1} leq -dk + 1 - #{i | deg(v_i) = 1}, ] where we use the inequality in the assumption and the fact that ( sum_{i=1}^{k} deg(v_i) = d ). As ( k geq 2 ), this shows that there exists a choice ( i ) such that: [ x^i_d geq x^i_{d-1} + cdots + (d-2)x^i_2 + (d-2)x^i_1 - d. ] 9. **Inductive Hypothesis**: By the inductive hypothesis, we know that ( deg v_i = 1 ) or ( d-1 ). If ( deg v_i = d-1 ), then clearly ( k = 2 ) and ( deg v_{k+1-i} = 1 ). In any case, we have ( #{i | deg(v_i) = 1} geq 1 ), and so: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} left( -x^i_d - x^i_1 + sum_{j=1}^{d-1} (d-j)x^i_j right) leq -dk. ] Therefore, we must have that: [ left( -x^i_d - x^i_1 + sum_{j=1}^{d-1} (d-j)x^i_j right) leq -d ] holds for all ( i = 1, ldots, k ), and by the inductive hypothesis, we have ( G_i' ) only has vertices of degrees ( 1, d-1, d ). Hence, ( G ) also only has vertices of degrees ( 1, d-1, d ), as desired. We thus have proved the claim by induction. The problem statement then follows immediately as a corollary.

We can calculate the percentage reduction in the price of oil: Percentage reduction = [(P - R) / P] * 100 Percentage reduction = [(Rs. 17.78 - Rs. 16) / Rs. 17.78] * 100 Percentage reduction = [Rs. 1.78 / Rs. 17.78] * 100 Percentage reduction ≈ 10.01% Therefore, the percentage reduction in the price of oil is approximately boxed{10.01%} ."},{"prompt":"There are three boxes of stones.

Let x be the amount of money Sisyphus has initially, which is 0. 2. **Quantification of Moves:** Sisyphus moves ( a ) stones from one box to another each hour. For each transfer, he earns or loses money based on the difference in the number of stones in the two involved boxes. 3. **Earning from Move:** Suppose Sisyphus moves a stone from box A to box B. Then, [ text{Earnings} = (text{number of stones in box } A) - (text{number of stones in box } B) - 1 ] (The -1 accounts for the stone being moved). 4. **Invariant Quantity Definition:** Let us define the quantity, [ N = 2x + a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ] We claim that ( N ) remains invariant. 5. **Verifying Invariance of N:** - Before the move: [ N = 2x + a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ] - After moving one stone from box A to box B, where ( a' = a-1 ) and ( b' = b+1 ): [ N' = 2(x + (a - b - 1)) + (a-1)^2 + (b+1)^2 + c^2 ] 6. **Calculating N':** [ N' = 2x + 2(a - b - 1) + (a-1)^2 + (b+1)^2 + c^2 ] Expanding the squares: [ (a-1)^2 = a^2 - 2a + 1 ] [ (b+1)^2 = b^2 + 2b + 1 ] Therefore, [ N' = 2x + 2a - 2b - 2 + a^2 - 2a + 1 + b^2 + 2b + 1 + c^2 ] Simplifying and combining like terms: [ N' = 2x + a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ] Thus, we see that: [ N' = N ] 7. **Conclusion:** Since ( N = 2x + a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ) is invariant and all stones return to their initial boxes after 1000 years, the initial and final values of ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ) do not change.

To win 4 games under these conditions, Team A must win the first 3 games and lose 1 game (since the question implies that all 5 games are played, which means the series wasn't decided in the first 3 games). The probability of this happening can be calculated as follows: - The number of ways to choose 1 game to lose out of the first 3 games is {C}_{3}^{1}. - The probability of winning a game for the non-star players is frac{1}{2}. - Therefore, the probability of winning 3 games and losing 1 in the first 3 games is {C}_{3}^{1} times left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 times frac{1}{2} = 3 times frac{1}{8} times frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{16}. Hence, the probability of Team A winning under these conditions is boxed{frac{3}{16}}, making option B correct. **For Option C:** To calculate the probability of Team A winning in 3 games against Team B, we consider two scenarios: when the star player M plays in the first 3 games, and when M does not. - The probability of M playing in the first 3 games, P(D), is calculated as the number of ways to choose 2 non-star players to play out of 4, and then arranging 3 players (including M) to play, divided by the total ways to arrange any 3 players out of 5 to play, which is frac{{C}_{4}^{2} times {A}_{3}^{3}}{{A}_{5}^{3}} = frac{3}{5}. - Consequently, the probability of M not playing in the first 3 games, P(overline{D}), is 1 - P(D) = frac{2}{5}. The probability of Team A winning in 3 games given M plays, P(C|D), is (frac{1}{2})^2 times frac{3}{4} = frac{3}{16}, since two non-star players have a frac{1}{2} chance of winning their games, and M has a frac{3}{4} chance. The probability of Team A winning in 3 games given M does not play, P(C|overline{D}), is (frac{1}{2})^3 = frac{1}{8}, as all three players have a frac{1}{2} chance of winning their games. Therefore, the overall probability of Team A winning in 3 games, P(C), is P(D)P(C|D) + P(overline{D})P(C|overline{D}) = frac{3}{5} times frac{3}{16} + frac{2}{5} times frac{1}{8} = frac{13}{80}. Thus, the probability of Team A winning in 3 games against Team B is boxed{frac{13}{80}}, making option C correct. **For Option D:** Given that Team A wins in 3 games against Team B, the probability of the star player M from Team A playing in these games, P(D|C), can be calculated using Bayes' theorem: P(D|C) = frac{P(C|D)P(D)}{P(C)} = frac{frac{3}{5} times frac{3}{16}}{frac{13}{80}} = frac{9}{13}. Therefore, the probability of the star player M from Team A playing in the first 3 games, given that Team A wins in 3 games, is boxed{frac{9}{13}}, which shows that option D is incorrect based on the initial solution provided.

Let's consider: - One pizza should definitely have mushrooms (for Vanya). - The second pizza should potentially have tomatoes and sausage to satisfy the taste preferences of Nikita and Igor. 4. **Check if Two Pizzas Are Enough:** - If the first pizza has mushrooms, Vanya is satisfied. Now, since Masha does not want sausage and prefers tomatoes, another pizza must avoid sausage but include tomatoes. - This causes a conflict with Igor who requires sausage but no mushrooms; and with Dasha who wants no tomatoes (but all resulting combinations will have either mushrooms or tomatoes due to prioritization needs). 5. **Evaluate Options:** Even with possible combinations and strategic ordering of individual pizza types, the overlapping restrictions and preferences for distinct ingredients make it impossible to satisfy every child's order with just two pizzas. 6. **Conclusion:** - Adding tomatoes to the first pizza to cater to Masha leads to having mushrooms (and avoids sausage), which can't satisfy all. - Keeping mushrooms and adding sausage caters Igor but leaves Masha unsatisfied.

We need a configuration of the string that ensures that interdependency among nails. 2. **Configuration using words:** - We need a sequence of wrapping the string around the nails such that it meets the condition.

How many kilograms of apples were bought for 333 rupees?","completion":"Let's denote the number of kilograms bought for 333 rupees as x. From the given information, we have the following equations: 1. For the first 30 kgs, the cost is l rupees per kilogram. So, the cost of 30 kgs is 30l. 2. For the next 6 kgs (from 30 to 36 kgs), the cost is q rupees per kilogram. So, the cost of 6 kgs is 6q. 3. The total cost for 36 kgs is 366 rupees. Therefore, 30l + 6q = 366. 4. The cost of the first 15 kgs is 150 rupees, which means 15l = 150. From this, we can find the value of l, which is l = 150/15 = 10 rupees per kilogram. Now, let's substitute the value of l into the equation for 36 kgs: 30l + 6q = 366 30(10) + 6q = 366 300 + 6q = 366 6q = 366 - 300 6q = 66 q = 66/6 q = 11 rupees per kilogram. Now, we need to find out how many kilograms were bought for 333 rupees. We know that the first 30 kgs cost 10 rupees per kilogram, so the cost for 30 kgs is 30 * 10 = 300 rupees. The remaining amount of money spent (333 - 300) is for the apples that cost q rupees per kilogram. So, the number of additional kilograms bought is (333 - 300) / q = 33 / 11 = 3 kgs.

Rewrite the terms: [1 = 2^{frac{x-y}{y}} - frac{3}{2} y] Further simplifying: [1 = 2^{frac{x}{y}-1} - frac{3}{2} y] 2. Next, we multiply through by 2 to achieve a common denominator: [1 cdot 2 = 2 cdot 2^{frac{x}{y} - 1} - 3y] Which simplifies to: [2 = 2^{frac{x}{y}} - 3y] 3. We now have: [2^{frac{x}{y}} - 2 = 3y] 4. Observations: - The right-hand side of the equation, (3y), must be a multiple of 3. - The left-hand side's expression, (2^{frac{x}{y}} - 2), is positive because (2^{frac{x}{y}}) is a power of 2, which is always positive. 5. Since (2^{frac{x}{y}} - 2) is an integer, (2^{frac{x}{y}}) must also be an integer. Thus, (frac{x}{y}) must be an integer. Let’s denote (frac{x}{y} = k), where (k in mathbb{Z}). 6. By substituting (frac{x}{y} = k), the equation transforms into: [2^k - 2 = 3y] The solutions for this are controlled by the factorization of powers of 2 modulo 3, observing patterns in modular arithmetic we get: - For (k) even: (k = 2n): [2^{2n} = (2^n)^2] This provides a modulo 3 pattern: ((2^n)^2 equiv 1^2 (text{mod } 3) = 1) Thus: [2^{2n} equiv 1 (text{mod } 3) implies 2^k = 2^{2n} equiv 1 (text{mod } 3)] So, [2^{2n} - 2 equiv 1 - 2 equiv -1 (text{mod } 3) neq 0 (text{mod } 3)] Therefore, (2^{k} - 2 = 3y) holds no solution for (k) even as the left side is never a multiple of 3. - For (k) odd: (k = 2n + 1): [2^{2n+1} = 2 cdot 2^{2n}] This also provides a modulo 3 pattern: [2^{2n+1} equiv 2 cdot 1 equiv 2 (text{mod } 3)] So, [2^{2n+1} - 2 equiv 2 - 2 equiv 0 (text{mod } 3)] Yields: [2^{2n+1} - 2 = 3y] Hence: [y = frac{2^{2n+1} - 2}{3}] 7.

Step 4: Reconsider placement constraints. - Placing squares in such a manner where the vertex of one smaller square lies on the side of a larger one is geometrically constrained. - Taking the minimal side length’s square and examining adjoining squares reveals, at least one square may not align as required for infinite tiling under only one use.

The lines ( XX', YY', ) and ( ZZ' ) are concurrent (or parallel) if and only if the cross ratios ( dv(S, X, Y, Z) = dv(S, X', Y', Z') ). Let's implement this theorem in our given problem: 1. **Define Points and Lines:** - ( M ): Midpoint of side ( BC ). - ( N ): Midpoint of side ( AB ). - ( P ): Intersection of the line ( AI ) and the line ( DE ). - ( W ): Intersection of ( AI ) with ( BC ). - ( infty ): The point at infinity on line ( AC ), meaning the line parallel to ( MN ) intersecting ( AC ). 2. **Objective:** - To show that ( M, N, ) and ( P ) are collinear, we need to show that the cross ratios are equal: ( dv(C, A, E, infty) = dv(C, W, D, M) ). 3. **Calculation of Cross Ratios:** - For line ( AC ): ( dv(C, A, E, infty) ). - Since ( infty ) represents the point at infinity on ( AC ), the cross ratio simplifies as follows: [ dv(C, A, E, infty) = frac{CE}{AE} ] - For line ( BC ): ( dv(C, W, D, M) ). - Considering the position of points ( C, W, D, ) and ( M ) on line ( BC ), the cross ratio is: [ dv(C, W, D, M) = frac{CD}{CM} cdot frac{WM}{WD} ] 4. **Equality of Cross Ratios:** - To validate if these cross ratios are equal, observe the tangential segments: - ( CE ) and ( CD ) are equal because they are tangents from ( C ) to the incircle. - Therefore, [ frac{CE}{AE} = frac{CD}{CM} cdot frac{WM}{WD} ] 5. **Expressing Lengths with Sides (a, b, c):** - Use the lengths of sides (a, b, c) of triangle (ABC) to express the tangents and other lengths. As these calculations are consistent with the sides and segments derived in prior related solutions: - If each length satisfies the required equality, the initial condition holds, and hence the cross ratios are proven equal. 6. **Conclusion:** - Since ( dv(C, A, E, infty) = dv(C, W, D, M) ) holds true, it follows from the theorem that points ( M, N, ) and ( P ) lie on a single straight line.

Let's analyze why: - If a_i < a_j, then for each k greater than j such that a_k > a_j, a_k is also greater than a_i. Similarly, for each k less than i such that a_k < a_i, a_k is also less than a_j. - Given a_i < a_j, this causes a_i' to be determined by smaller values and a_j' by larger values, leading to a_i' < a_j'. 3. **Behavior of Constant Pairs:** - If (i, j) is a constant pair, then in most cases it becomes increasing in the successor sequence except when a_i = a_{i+1} = ldots = a_j, where it remains constant forever. - The key consideration from behavior (i) applies here: for some k with i < k < j and a_k neq a_i = a_j, a_k either contributes to the left of j or the right of i, enhancing the relationship a_i' < a_j' for successors. - Thus, if a_i = a_j but other elements exist between i and j not equal to a_i, a_i' and a_j' will change such that a_i' leq a_j' and typically a_i' < a_j'. 4. **Monotonic Behavior of S and T:** - Let ( S ) be the number of increasing pairs and ( T ) be the number of constant pairs. - Through iterations of creating successor sequences, S and T both increase monotonically. - Since the number of pairs is finite and bounded above, S and T cannot increase indefinitely and must stabilize eventually, implying they will no longer change. 5. **Stabilization:** - When S and T stabilize, the sequence no longer changes. The mutual relationships between sequence elements remain constant, meaning the number of elements smaller or larger than any fixed a_k no longer changes. - Therefore, once the sequence reaches such stabilization, A_{m} = A_{m+1} for some natural number m. 6. **Conclusion:** - Since the number of increasing and constant pairs must eventually stabilize and the sequence becomes monotonic or constant, we conclude that there exists a natural number m such that A_m = A_{m+1}.

Under this inversion: - Point (B) is mapped to some point (B'). - Circle (S), which passes through the center of inversion, is mapped to a straight line (S') passing through point (B'). - The chord (AB), which passes through the center of inversion, is mapped to itself. - The tangent circles (S_1) and (S_2), which do not pass through the center of inversion, are mapped to two circles (S_1') and (S_2') which are tangent to each other and to the straight line (S') at point (B'). 4. The point of tangency (M') of the inverted circles (S_1') and (S_2') (which corresponds to the point (M) in the original configuration) lies on the angle bisector of the angle formed by the intersection of the straight lines (AB) and (S'). 5. Applying another inversion with the same center (point (A)), the angle bisector (which is a straight line segment in the inverted configuration) is mapped to an arc of a circle. This circle bisects the angle with vertex (B) between the straight line (AB) and the circle (S). # Conclusion: The set of the tangency points of all possible pairs of tangent circles inscribed in a segment is an arc of a circle.

Therefore, if we sum the number of dances each person has participated in, we must get an even number. This is because: [ text{Sum of all dances} = sum_{i=1}^n d_i ] where (d_i) represents the number of times the (i)-th person danced. 2. **Sum of Dances is Even**: Since each dance involves a pair of people, the total sum (sum_{i=1}^n d_i) must be an even number. This is because each dance contributes (2) to the sum. 3. **Odd Number of Participants**: Suppose the number of participants (n) is odd. Let us examine the possible values for (d_i), the number of times each person has danced. Each (d_i) can either be even or odd. 4. **Analyzing the Sums**: Suppose (k) is the number of people who danced an odd number of times and (m = n - k) is the number of people who danced an even number of times. We need to check the parity (evenness or oddness) of the sum: [ sum_{i=1}^n d_i ] 5. **Sum of Odd and Even Components**: - If a person danced an odd number of times, it contributes an odd number to the sum. - If a person danced an even number of times, it contributes an even number to the sum.

There are 26 boxes in total, and 6 of them contain pans. So, the number of boxes that don't contain pans is: 26 boxes - 6 boxes = 20 boxes Half of these remaining boxes contain decorations, so the number of boxes with decorations is: 20 boxes / 2 = 10 boxes That means the other half, which is also 10 boxes, contain teacups. Now, let's calculate how many teacups are in those 10 boxes before any are broken. Each box has 5 rows with 4 cups in each row, so each box contains: 5 rows * 4 cups/row = 20 cups Since there are 10 boxes of teacups, the total number of teacups is: 10 boxes * 20 cups/box = 200 cups Samuel breaks 2 cups every time he picks up a box. Since there are 10 boxes, the total number of cups broken is: 10 boxes * 2 cups/box = 20 cups Finally, let's subtract the broken cups from the total number of cups to find out how many are left: 200 cups - 20 cups = 180 cups So, after Samuel has taken all of the teacups out of the boxes and broken some, there are boxed{180} teacups left."},{"prompt":"Cory has 4 apples, 1 orange, and 2 bananas.

If the proposition (p vee q) is true, and (p wedge q) is false, the range of values for the real number (a) is _________.","completion":"Let's examine the propositions: For proposition (p), the solution set of the inequality (a^x > 1) being ({x|x < 0}) implies that (a) must be between (0) and (1), or (0 < a < 1), because only if (a) is in this range will the function (a^x) be decreasing and thus be greater than (1) for negative (x). For proposition (q), the function (y = log(ax^2 - x + a)) has domain (R) means that the expression inside the logarithm, (ax^2 - x + a), must be positive for all real numbers (x). This implies that the corresponding quadratic equation has no real roots; hence the discriminant must be less than (0), or (Delta = 1 - 4a^2 < 0). Solving this inequality, we find (0 < a < frac{1}{2}). Since (p vee q) is true and (p wedge q) is false, it means one proposition is true and the other is false. We have two cases to consider: - If (p) is true and (q) is false, we have (0 < a < 1) and (a leq 0) or (a geq frac{1}{2}), which is not possible. - If (p) is false and (q) is true, we have (a leq 0) or (a geq 1) and (0 < a < frac{1}{2}). The overlapping range from these conditions is (frac{1}{2} leq a < 1). Hence, the possible range for (a) is (frac{1}{2} leq a < 1). Rewritten in steps for clarity: 1. Analyze proposition (p), we get (0 < a < 1). 2. Analyze proposition (q), we obtain (0 < a < frac{1}{2}). 3. The logical OR ((p vee q)) implies at least one of (p) or (q) is true. 4. The logical AND ((p wedge q)) being false implies that one of (p) or (q) is false. 5. We conclude that for (a), the only values that satisfy both conditions are (frac{1}{2} leq a < 1).

Since f(0)=a > 0, f(x) can have at most one zero. - If a > 1, f(x) is increasing for x < 0, decreasing for 0 < x < ln a, then increasing for x > ln a.

Thus, F(x) is decreasing for x > 0, and since F(x) < F(0) = 0 for x > 0, f(x) < f(-x). This implies x_1 + x_2 > 0 because f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 0 and f(x_1) < f(-x_2), leading to x_1 > -x_2.
