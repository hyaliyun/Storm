Therefore, the number of ways to choose the top face is (1). 3. **Choosing the Opposite Face:** After fixing (C_1) on the top face, there are 5 remaining colors. We have 5 choices for the color of the bottom face. 4. **Fixing the Orientation:** With (C_1) on the top and some color (say (C_2)) on the bottom, we can freely rotate the cube around the vertical axis passing through (C_1) and (C_2). To fix this rotational degree of freedom, we place the lowest remaining color (say (C_3)) on one of the vertical side faces (north position). 5. **Coloring the Remaining Faces:** With (C_1) on top, (C_2) on the bottom, and (C_3) in a fixed side position (north), we have 3 remaining faces to color with the remaining 3 colors. The number of ways to do this is (3! = 6). 6. **Total Number of Ways:** Therefore, the total number of ways to color the cube such that each face is a different color: [ 1 times 5 times 6 = 30 ] Conclusion: (boxed{30}) Part 2: Coloring the Octahedron 1. **Choosing Colors:** We are given 8 different colors, let's denote them by (C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5, C_6, C_7,) and (C_8). 2. **Fixing the First Face:** We can always rotate the octahedron such that (C_1) is on the top face. Therefore, the number of ways to choose the top face is (1). 3. **Choosing the Opposite Face:** With (C_1) on the top face, there are 7 remaining colors. We have 7 choices for the bottom face. 4. **Choosing Colors for the Adjacent Faces:** Now we need to color 3 of the faces that are adjacent to the top face. We select 3 out of the remaining 6 colors. The number of ways to choose 3 colors out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{6}{3} = 20 ] 5. **Fixing the Orientation:** Among these 3 chosen colors, we fix the lowest one (say (C_2)) into a fixed position (north).

Let's define the arrival time of the bus as ( t_1 ) and the arrival time of Jamie as ( t_2 ), both in minutes from 1:00 PM to 180 minutes (3:00 PM is 120 minutes from 1:00 PM). The bus waits for 20 minutes, so the condition for Jamie to catch the bus is ( t_1 leq t_2 leq t_1 + 20 ). 1. **Whole Region**: The total possible time scenario is a square of side 120 minutes (from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM for both ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 )), so the area of total outcomes is ( 120 times 120 = 14400 ) square minutes. 2. **Overlap Region**: Since the bus waits 20 minutes, the shaded overlap area consists of a strip from ( t_1 = t_2 ) to ( t_2 = t_1 + 20 ). Like the initial solution, this forms a parallelogram extending from the diagonal (at ( t_2 = t_1 )) upwards by 20 minutes. - The parallelogram's height is 20 and the maximum length along the diagonal where both ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 + 20 ) lie between 0 and 120 is approximately 100 (since after 100 minutes from 1:00 PM, adding extra 20 minutes would exceed the 120 minutes limit by roughly 20 minutes). - The area of this parallelogram is base ( times ) height = ( 100 times 20 = 2000 ) square minutes. 3. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that Jamie arrives while the bus is there equals the ratio of the overlap area to the total area (parallelogram area / total square area), which is ( frac{2000}{14400} = frac{5}{36} ).

The resulting triangles will have sides 12, 16, and the hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: [ text{Hypotenuse} = sqrt{12^2 + 16^2} = sqrt{144 + 256} = sqrt{400} = 20 ] Thus, we get right triangles with sides 12, 16, 20 all of which are pairwise rational. 5. **Further Division for Different Triangles:** Now, let's create other right triangles within our 12 times 16 rectangle by additional cuts. For instance, we can divide our existing triangles into smaller triangles by drawing lines parallel to the sides of the triangle, ensuring rational side lengths on each segment. 6. **Verification:** Check to verify all resulting triangles are different. Each new division results in triangles of different side lengths that are all rational. 7. **Repeat Tilting:** Continue this process ensuring that each triangle created in a similar rectangle somewhere on the plane is different (based on their rational side lengths) and covers part of the plane. 8. **Conclusion:** Based on the repeated division, verification, and the tiling of the plane with these segments show that it is possible to tile the entire plane with pairwise different triangles with rational side lengths.

Given: ( H_f = 18 ) meters ( L_f = 45 ) meters ( H_b = 28 ) meters ( L_b = ? ) (We need to find this) The ratio of the height to the length of the shadow for the flagpole should be equal to the ratio of the height to the length of the shadow for the building, because the angles of elevation of the sun are the same for both the flagpole and the building. So, we can write the proportion as: ( frac{H_f}{L_f} = frac{H_b}{L_b} ) Now we can plug in the known values: ( frac{18}{45} = frac{28}{L_b} ) To find ( L_b ), we cross-multiply: ( 18 times L_b = 28 times 45 ) Now we solve for ( L_b ): ( L_b = frac{28 times 45}{18} ) ( L_b = frac{28 times 5 times 9}{18} ) ( L_b = frac{28 times 5}{2} ) ( L_b = 14 times 5 ) ( L_b = 70 ) meters So, the length of the shadow cast by the building is boxed{70} meters."},{"prompt":"Three constant forces p, q, and r act on an arbitrary point P in triangle A B C, with directions along P A, P B, and P C respectively; determine the position of point P where these three forces are in equilibrium.","completion":"To find the point ( P ) inside triangle ( ABC ) where three forces ( p, q, r ) (directed along ( PA, PB, PC ) respectively) equilibrate, we will follow these steps: 1. **Triangle Balance Condition:** The three forces ( p, q, r ) will be in equilibrium if they form a closed triangle when connected head to tail. This means the angles between these forces should satisfy: [ angle(p, q) = varsigma, quad angle(q, r) = pi, quad angle(r, p) = k. ] 2. **Circle of Angular Convergence:** The location of ( P ) can be determined by considering the points from which the lines ( PA ) and ( PB ) subtend the given angle ( varsigma ). These locations lie on a circular arc with endpoints ( A ) and ( B ). 3. **Construction of Circle Center for ( PA ) and ( PB ):** To find the center ( O''') of the circle whose arc ( AB ) subtends ( varsigma ): - Draw the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ). - From point ( B ), draw a line making an angle of ( varsigma - frac{pi}{2} ) with ( AB ). - The intersection of the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) and this line gives the center ( O''' ).

Prove that B divides A , meaning there exists a third polynomial C with real coefficients such that A = B cdot C . *Proposed by Victor Wang*","completion":"1. **Initial Setup and Assumptions:** Let ( A(x,y) ) and ( B(x,y) ) be two-variable polynomials with real coefficients. We are given that ( frac{A(x,y)}{B(x,y)} ) is a polynomial in ( x ) for infinitely many values of ( y ), and a polynomial in ( y ) for infinitely many values of ( x ). We need to prove that ( B ) divides ( A ), i.e., there exists a polynomial ( C(x,y) ) such that ( A(x,y) = B(x,y) cdot C(x,y) ). 2. **Polynomial Division in One Variable:** For some infinite set of real numbers ( S ), for any ( y_0 in S ), ( B(x,y_0) mid A(x,y_0) ) as polynomials in ( x ). Treat ( A ) and ( B ) as polynomials in ( x ) with coefficients that are polynomials in ( y ). By the Division Algorithm, we can write: [ A(x,y) = B(x,y)Q(x,y) + R(x,y), ] where ( Q(x,y) ) and ( R(x,y) ) are polynomials in ( x ) with coefficients that are rational functions in ( y ). 3. **Form of the Remainder:** By putting the sum ( R(x,y) ) over a common denominator, we can write: [ R(x,y) = frac{C(x,y)}{D(y)}, ] where ( C(x,y) in mathbb{R}[x,y] ) and ( D(y) in mathbb{R}[y] ). 4. **Evaluating at Specific Values:** For an arbitrary ( y_0 in S ), plug in ( y = y_0 ) into the equation. Since ( B(x,y_0) mid A(x,y_0) ) as polynomials in ( x ), we have ( R(x,y_0) = 0 ). Therefore, for infinitely many ( y_0 ), ( R(x,y_0) = 0 ). 5. **Implication for the Remainder:** Note that ( D(y) ) can only have finitely many roots. Since ( C(x,y) ) is a polynomial in ( y ) with coefficients that are polynomials in ( x ), there exists an infinite set of values for which plugging ( y ) into ( C(x,y) ) outputs 0. This implies ( C(x,y) = 0 ) identically, so ( R(x,y) = 0 ). 6. **Conclusion:** Since ( R(x,y) = 0 ), we have: [ A(x,y) = B(x,y)Q(x,y), ] proving that ( B ) divides ( A ).

This gives us: [ text{Total pairs} = binom{n_i}{2} = frac{n_i(n_i-1)}{2}. ] Summing over all residue classes, we have: [ bar{A}(m) = sum_{i=0}^{m-1} binom{n_i}{2}. ] Similarly for set ( B ): [ bar{B}(m) = sum_{i=0}^{m-1} binom{n_i'}{2}. ] 5. **Main Comparison to Prove:** To prove (bar{A}(m) geq bar{B}(m)), it suffices to show: [ sum_{i=0}^{m-1} binom{n_i}{2} geq sum_{i=0}^{m-1} binom{n_i'}{2}. ] Transforming this into the equivalent form involves simplifying the binomial coefficient expressions: [ sum_{i=0}^{m-1} frac{n_i(n_i-1)}{2} geq sum_{i=0}^{m-1} frac{n_i'(n_i'-1)}{2}, ] which can be simplified to: [ sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i^2 - sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i geq sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i'^2 - sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i', ] thus: [ sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i^2 geq sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i'^2. ] 6. **Detailed Analysis Using Equality of Sums:** Using ( sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i = sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i' = n ), observe that the sequences ( {n_0, n_1, ldots, n_{m-1}} ) and ( {n_0', n_1', ldots, n_{m-1}'} ) must satisfy: [ |n_i - n_j| leq 1. ] Consider ( n_i^2 ) and ( n_j^2 ) under different conditions. If ( n_i geq n_j + 2 ), redistribution to reduce the difference increases the sum of squares: [ (n_i - 1)^2 + (n_j + 1)^2 - n_i^2 - n_j^2 = 2(n_i - n_j - 1) > 0. ] Therefore, redistributing values in these cases always results in a smaller total sum of squares. 7. **Conclusion Using Equalization:** When rearranging ( n_i )'s such that they replicate the equalized distribution of ( n_i' )'s, the sum of squares ( sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i^2 ) remains as high or higher because: [ sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i^2 geq sum_{i=0}^{m-1} n_i'^2. ] Hence, the inequality holds: [ bar{A}(m) geq bar{B}(m). ] [ blacksquare ]"},{"prompt":"Calculate the value of the expression (15 + 12)^2 (12^2 + 15^2 + 6 cdot 15 cdot 12).","completion":"1.

We set f(sqrt{a}) = frac{1}{3}a^{3/2} - asqrt{a} + 1 equal to frac{11}{12} and solve for a: frac{1}{3}a^{3/2} - asqrt{a} + 1 = frac{11}{12} quad Rightarrow quad frac{1}{3}a^{3/2} - asqrt{a} = -frac{1}{12} quad Rightarrow quad a( frac{1}{3}sqrt{a} - sqrt{a} ) = -frac{1}{12} quad Rightarrow quad a( sqrt{a}(frac{1}{3} - 1 ) ) = -frac{1}{12} quad Rightarrow quad -frac{2}{3}asqrt{a} = -frac{1}{12} quad Rightarrow quad asqrt{a} = frac{1}{8} quad Rightarrow quad a^{frac{3}{2}} = frac{1}{8} quad Rightarrow quad a = left(frac{1}{8}right)^{frac{2}{3}} quad Rightarrow quad a = frac{1}{4}.

Each side of a triangle is divided into p equal parts, and each of the division points is connected to the opposite vertex. Calculate the maximum number of pairwise disjoint regions into which the triangle is divided.","completion":"1. Let's begin by confirming that three of these segments (called cevians) cannot be concurrent. Consider the triangle ABC, and let X, Y, and Z be points dividing the sides BC, AC, and AB, respectively, into p equal parts. 2. According to **Ceva's Theorem** (which states that three cevians AX, BY, and CZ of triangle ABC are concurrent if and only if frac{AZ}{ZB} cdot frac{BX}{XC} cdot frac{CY}{YA} = 1), we would have the following condition if AX, BY, and CZ were concurrent: [ frac{AZ}{ZB} cdot frac{BX}{XC} cdot frac{CY}{YA} = 1 ] 3. However, due to the way we construct the division points, let the ratios be expressed using positive integers such that (k, l, m in {1, 2, ldots, p-1}) where: [ frac{AZ}{ZB} = frac{k}{p-k}, quad frac{BX}{XC} = frac{l}{p-l}, quad frac{CY}{YA} = frac{m}{p-m} ] 4. Substituting these ratios into Ceva's equation, we get: [ frac{k}{p-k} cdot frac{l}{p-l} cdot frac{m}{p-m} = 1 ] 5. Simplifying this equation, we arrive at: [ klm = (p-k)(p-l)(p-m) ] [ klm = p^3 - p^2(k+l+m) + p(kl+lm+mk) - klm ] 6. This simplifies further to: [ 2klm = p(p^2 - p(k+l+m) + kl + lm + mk) ] 7. From this, we deduce that p must divide the product klm, which is impossible because k, l, and m are all among the set {1, 2, ldots, p-1}, which do not contain multiples of the prime p. Thus, our initial statement is confirmed, and three cevians cannot be concurrent. 8. Next, we analyze how the triangle is divided by cevians: - Drawing the cevians from vertex A divides the triangle ABC into p smaller triangles. - Then, drawing cevians from vertex B will further subdivide each of these p triangles into p more regions, resulting in a total of p^2 regions so far. 9. Now consider the cevians drawn from vertex C. Each cevian from C intersects the lines drawn from A and B as well as the side AB. For each of these, it increases the number of regions by the number of its intersections, which is exactly 2(p - 1) + 1 = 2p - 1 (since it intersects each cevian from A and from B plus the side AB). 10. Thus, with the addition of p - 1 cevians from C, we get: [ text{New regions added} = (p - 1) times (2p - 1) ] 11. Combining everything, the total number of regions is: [ p^2 + (p - 1)(2p - 1) ] 12.

It is easy to prove that for any positive integers m, n with m > 1, we have frac{m+n}{m-1+n} < frac{m}{m-1}.

Let’s consider arranging some circles in a hexagonal pattern, as hexagons provide a close-packing structure that is optimal for such arrangements. 3. **Hexagon Arrangement Analysis:** - Consider the arrangement of 6 circles with centers located at the vertices of a regular hexagon inscribed inside the unit circle ( S ). - The side length of this hexagon is exactly 1 since each vertex of the hexagon lies on the circumference of ( S ). - The radius of each of these 6 circles of radius 1 extends beyond the unit circle ( S ) and intersects ( S ), but without containing ( S )'s center. 4. **Further Analysis:** - Besides these 6 circles, we can fit additional circles outside the unit circle ( S ) but still intersecting ( S ) and not containing the center of ( S ). - We place additional circles with centers at the vertices of squares constructed on the sides of the inscribed hexagon. These squares will each have circles of radius 1, with their centers falling outside ( S ). 5. **Maximum Number Calculation:** - This pattern allows us to place 6 (from the hexagon vertices) + 12 (from the square vertices) = 18 circles of radius 1 intersecting ( S ) without containing the center of ( S ) or each other’s centers. 6. **Proof of Impossibility Beyond 18 Circles:** - Assume hypothetically that we could place more than 18 circles. For this condition to hold, we would have more than 20 points (including the center of ( S ) and the centers of all additional circles) contained within a circle of radius 2 on a plane. - However, from the problem statement, we know that in such a case, the minimal distance between any two points must still be at least 1. 7. **Theoretical validation:** - Reference problem 48: it provides that it’s impossible for such a configuration of more than 20 points to maintain the minimum distance condition. - With 18 circles, you achieve the maximum arrangement without violating the minimum distance condition.

Now, if Marvin practiced M problems today, Arvin, who practices twice as many, would have practiced 2M problems today. The total number of problems practiced by both of them today and yesterday is 480. So we can write the equation: Marvin's yesterday + Marvin's today + Arvin's yesterday + Arvin's today = Total 40 + M + 80 + 2M = 480 Combining like terms, we get: 3M + 120 = 480 Subtracting 120 from both sides, we get: 3M = 480 - 120 3M = 360 Dividing both sides by 3, we get: M = 360 / 3 M = 120 So, Marvin practiced 120 math problems today.

In contrast, a heart symbol consists of two upper arcs forming a rounded shape and a pointed bottom without any additional stem. 2. **Visualize the Positioning and Shapes**: Observe the spade symbol and note where we can make the cuts to transform it into a heart. The goal is to rearrange the pieces in a way that uses all material from the spade symbol. 3. **Make the Cuts**: - First, cut horizontally across the spade just below the top arcs and above the stem, separating the top part from the stem. - Next, split the bottom stem vertically into two pieces. 4. **Reconfigure the Pieces to Form a Heart**: - Using the upper part of the spade (the two arcs), place it exactly where the corresponding part of a heart symbol would be. - Take the two vertical halves of the bottom stem and place them alongside each other beneath the arcs to form the bottom pointed part of the heart. 5. **Check and Adjust**: - Make sure all edges of the pieces align seamlessly to create a single heart symbol without leaving any gaps or overlaps.

This means that the number of married women is 0.7704918032786885 * 0.61E. Now, let's calculate the number of married women: Married Women = 0.7704918032786885 * 0.61E Married Women = 0.4702E (approximately) Since the total number of married employees is 0.60E, the number of married men would be the difference between the total number of married employees and the number of married women: Married Men = Total Married - Married Women Married Men = 0.60E - 0.4702E Married Men = 0.1298E (approximately) Now, since 61 percent of the employees are women, the remaining 39 percent must be men: Men = 0.39E If 0.1298E of these men are married, then the number of single men is the difference between the total number of men and the number of married men: Single Men = Total Men - Married Men Single Men = 0.39E - 0.1298E Single Men = 0.2602E (approximately) To find the fraction of men who are single, we divide the number of single men by the total number of men: Fraction of Single Men = Single Men / Total Men Fraction of Single Men = 0.2602E / 0.39E When we divide both the numerator and the denominator by E, we get: Fraction of Single Men = 0.2602 / 0.39 Now, let's calculate the fraction: Fraction of Single Men ≈ 0.6671794871794872 So, approximately boxed{66.72} percent of the men are single."},{"prompt":"Given that the function f(x) = frac{ax+b}{x^2+1} is an odd function defined on (1,1) and f(1) = 1.

Differentiating f(x) with respect to x gives: f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{2x}{x^2+1}right) Using the quotient rule (left(frac{u}{v}right)' = frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}), where u = 2x and v = x^2+1, we find that: f'(x) = frac{2(x^2+1) - 2x(2x)}{(x^2+1)^2} = frac{2 - 2x^2}{(x^2+1)^2} For x in (-1, 1), -1 < x < 1 implies that -x^2 > -1, hence 2 - 2x^2 > 2 - 2(1) = 0.

Since ( S ) is the maximum value among ( S_1, S_2, S_3, ) and ( S_4 ), we know: [ S_i leq S quad(i=1, 2, 3, 4) ] 2. Summing these inequalities results in: [ sum_{i=1}^4 S_i leq 4S ] 3. Dividing both sides by (S) gives us: [ lambda = frac{sum_{i=1}^4 S_i}{S} leq 4 ] Thus, (lambda) cannot exceed 4. Let's now check the lower bound for (lambda). 4. Specifically, when the tetrahedron is regular (a regular tetrahedron), all faces are congruent. Therefore, we have: [ S_1 = S_2 = S_3 = S_4 = S ] In this case, [ sum_{i=1}^4 S_i = 4S ] Hence, [ lambda = frac{4S}{S} = 4 ] which shows that for a regular tetrahedron, (lambda) can achieve the value 4. 5. Next, let's consider if (lambda) can have a value less than 4 but greater than 2. We note that for a general tetrahedron, (cos 45^{circ} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) can be realized under certain configurations. 6. Consider the case where the planes forming the tetrahedron create dihedral angles of (45^circ). In such a configuration, let (S_4) be the base, and given the cosine relation mentioned above, the equation can be expressed as: [ S = S_4 = left(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 right) cos 45^{circ} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (S_1 + S_2 + S_3) ] Solving this, we have: [ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = sqrt{2} S ] 7. Summing over all four faces: [ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 = sqrt{2} S + S = (1 + sqrt{2}) S ] Thus, [ lambda = frac{(1 + sqrt{2}) S}{S} = 1 + sqrt{2} ] Since ( 1+sqrt{2} < 2.5 ), it implies: [ lambda = 1 + sqrt{2} < 2.5 ] 8.

Part 2: Determining the range of fleft(xright) on the interval left[-3,4right] From Part 1, we have the derivative of f(x) as: [f'left(xright) = 3x^{2}-12 = 3left(x^{2}-4right) = 3left(x+2right)left(x-2right).] To find where the function is increasing or decreasing, we analyze the sign of f'left(xright): - For x < -2, f'left(xright) > 0 (increasing). - For -2 < x < 2, f'left(xright) < 0 (decreasing). - For x > 2, f'left(xright) > 0 (increasing). Evaluating f(x) at critical points and endpoints of the interval: - fleft(-3right) = (-3)^{3} - 12cdot(-3) + 10 = -27 + 36 + 10 = 19. - fleft(-2right) = (-2)^{3} - 12cdot(-2) + 10 = -8 + 24 + 10 = 26. - fleft(2right) = 2^{3} - 12cdot2 + 10 = 8 - 24 + 10 = -6. - fleft(4right) = 4^{3} - 12cdot4 + 10 = 64 - 48 + 10 = 26. Therefore, the minimum value of f(x) on the interval is fleft(2right) = -6, and the maximum values are fleft(-2right) = fleft(4right) = 26.

Since 39 books were returned and there are 54 books in the special collection at the end of the month, we can infer that the number of books that were not returned is the difference between the number of books loaned out and the number of books returned: ( 60.00000000000001 - 39 = 21.00000000000001 ) books were not returned.

Therefore, the maximum value of 8 is reached when x is 13. However, since the function is linear and has no maximum, the value of 8 is not the absolute maximum; it's just the value of the function at x = 13. If we are looking for the interval in which the function reaches this value as its maximum, we would need additional constraints on the domain of x. Without such constraints, the function does not have a maximum value; it goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. If you are asking for the lower limit of the interval in which the function's value is at most 8, then we would look for the value of x where the function starts to exceed 8: f(x) = x - 5 > 8 x - 5 > 8 x > 13 So, the lower limit of the interval for which the function's value is at most 8 would be x = boxed{13} .

Since 2 bags of chips weigh 800 g, one bag of chips would weigh 800 g / 2 = 400 g. Therefore, 5 bags of chips would weigh 5 * 400 g = 2000 g. The total weight of 5 bags of chips and 4 bottles of juice is 2 kg 200 g. We need to convert this to grams to make it easier to calculate. 1 kg is equal to 1000 g, so 2 kg is equal to 2000 g. Therefore, 2 kg 200 g is equal to 2000 g + 200 g = 2200 g. Now, let's subtract the weight of the 5 bags of chips from the total weight to find the weight of the 4 bottles of juice. 2200 g (total weight) - 2000 g (weight of 5 bags of chips) = 200 g (weight of 4 bottles of juice). To find the weight of one bottle of juice, we divide the total weight of the 4 bottles by 4. 200 g / 4 = 50 g. So, one bottle of juice weighs 50 g.

Now from the fact that A = dfrac{pi}{3} and triangle ABC is a triangle (hence A + B + C = pi), we can deduce that: begin{align*} C &= pi - A - B &= pi - dfrac{pi}{3} - B &= dfrac{2pi}{3} - B. end{align*} Since sin^2 C + cos^2 C = 1, we have sin^2 (dfrac{2pi}{3} - B) + cos^2 (dfrac{2pi}{3} - B) = 1. Using the identity cos (2pi/3 - B) = -cos (B + pi/3) and sin (2pi/3 - B) = sin (B + pi/3), we can rewrite the equation as: sin left(B + dfrac{pi}{3}right) cos B + sin B cos left(dfrac{pi}{3}right) = sin^2 left(B + dfrac{pi}{3}right). sin left(B + dfrac{pi}{3}right) = sin^2 left(B + dfrac{pi}{3}right). To solve for sin(B + pi/3), we must have a special angle for which sin theta = (sin theta)^2. The only time this is true for 0 leq theta leq pi is when theta = dfrac{pi}{6}, which leads to sin theta = 1/2. Thus, B + dfrac{pi}{3} = dfrac{pi}{6}, which simplifies to B = dfrac{pi}{6} - dfrac{pi}{3} = -dfrac{pi}{6}. However, an angle cannot be negative in a triangle, so we reconsider our solution. We made a mistake in the last steps. The correct equation from sin(C) = sin^2(C) should be: begin{align*} sin left(dfrac{2pi}{3} - B right) = sin^2 left(dfrac{2pi}{3} - B right). end{align*} Since C cannot be dfrac{pi}{2} due to A being nonzero and positive, we can ignore the sin^2 C case and instead concentrate on sin(C) = 0, which implies C = pi or C = 0. Since C must be the third angle in a triangle with A already dfrac{pi}{3}, C cannot be pi or 0. Thus, we realize our approach is incorrect.

We get: begin{align*} a cos B + b cos left(dfrac{pi}{3}right) &= c sin C a cos B + frac{b}{2} &= c sin C. end{align*} Using the fact that a sin A = b sin B = c sin C (from the law of sines), we find: begin{align*} c sin A cos B + frac{b}{2} &= c sin C c sin left(dfrac{pi}{3}right) cos B + frac{b}{2} &= c sin left(dfrac{pi}{3}right) frac{sqrt{3}}{2} c cos B + frac{b}{2} &= frac{sqrt{3}}{2} c. end{align*} Isolating for cos B, we have: cos B = 1 - frac{b}{sqrt{3} c}. We need cos B = 1 for cos B leq 1. This is true if b = 0 which is not possible for a triangle side length. Therefore, we must have cos B < 1 which suggests B < dfrac{pi}{2}.

Let ( lfloor x rfloor = k ), where ( k ) is a positive integer. 2. **Set inequalities based on the properties of the floor function:** Since ( k = lfloor x rfloor ), we have ( k leq x < k + 1 ). Consequently, squaring both sides of ( k leq x ), we derive the inequality: [ k^2 leq x^2 ] Similarly, from ( x < k + 1 ), we get: [ x^2 < (k+1)^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 ] 3. **Combine with the original equation ( x^2 = r lfloor x rfloor ):** From the original equation ( x^2 = r k ), we know: [ k^2 leq rk < k^2 + 2k + 1 ] which simplifies to: [ k^2 leq r k < k^2 + 3k ] Dividing through by ( k ) (since ( k > 0 )), we obtain: [ k leq r < k + 3 ] 4. **Determine the possible values for ( k ):** The inequality ( k leq r < k + 3 ) indicates that: [ r - 3 < k leq r ] Thus, ( k ) must be an integer within the interval ( (r-3, r] ). There are at most three positive integers in this interval. Therefore, there are at most three possible values for ( k ), implying there can be at most three different positive solutions for ( x ). 5. **Verify there are at least two solutions:** Now, consider the interval ( [r-2, r] ) where the expression ( rk = r lfloor sqrt{rk} rfloor ) can be satisfied. This ensures that there are at least two such positive integers ( k ). For each integer ( k ) within this interval: [ k leq sqrt{rk} leq sqrt{(k+2)k} < k + 1 ] setting ( x = sqrt{rk} ) gives at least two values ( x ) that satisfy ( x^2 = r lfloor x rfloor ). # Conclusion: Hence, we have shown that for each real number ( r > 2 ), there are exactly two or three positive real numbers ( x ) satisfying the equation ( x^2 = r lfloor x rfloor ).

When two wrestlers with qualification numbers differing by more than 2 compete, the wrestler with the lower number always wins. The tournament operates on an elimination basis, meaning one wrestler is eliminated in every match until a single winner remains. 2. **Initial Observation:** A wrestler with number ( k ) can only lose to wrestlers with numbers ( k+1 ) or ( k+2 ). Therefore, after each round, the lowest remaining number can increase by at most 2. 3. **Calculating Maximum Possible Number for the Winner:** The tournament has ( n = 512 ) wrestlers and follows a single-elimination format, leading to ( log_2 512 = 9 ) rounds (since ( 512 = 2^9 )).

First, let us analyze the parity (odd or even nature) of the numbers involved. We know: - The result 11111 is an odd number. - We need to determine if the sum of the two numbers x and y can be odd. 3. Consider the properties of odd and even numbers: - An odd number plus an odd number is even. - An even number plus an even number is even. - Only an odd number plus an even number results in an odd number. 4. Suppose both x and y are even numbers: - 7 times x and 5 times y with both x and y being even will result in both terms being even since any number multiplied by an even number results in an even number. - The sum of two even numbers is even. - Thus, 7x + 5y would be even which contradicts 11111 being odd. 5. Suppose both x and y are odd numbers: - 7 times x and 5 times y with both x and y being odd will result in both terms being odd since odd number times odd number is odd. - The sum of two odd numbers is even. - Thus, 7x + 5y would again be even which contradicts 11111 being odd. 6. Thus, it must be the case that one of x or y is even, and the other is odd: - If one is even and the other is odd, the substitution into 7x + 5y results in one term being odd and the other being even. - The sum of an even number and an odd number is odd. 7. Therefore, the only possible solution for x and y that satisfies 7x + 5y = 11111 requires one number to be even and the other number to be odd.

So far, 8 rounds have been played (in each round, all teams are paired to play matches, and no pairs repeat across rounds). Is it true that there exist three teams that have not played a match against each other?","completion":"To determine if there must exist three teams that have not played any match among themselves within a football championship involving 18 teams and 8 rounds, we can follow a step-by-step logical approach. Step 1: Analyze the Team Matches Let's consider one of the teams, denoted as A. Step 2: Matches Played by Team A - In 8 rounds, team A has played with 8 different teams. - This means there are (18 - 1 - 8 = 9) teams with which team A has not played. Step 3: Considering a Subset of Teams Not Played with A Let’s denote these 9 teams as (B_1, B_2, ldots, B_9). We need to check if any three teams among these 9 have not played any match among themselves. Step 4: Check for Complete Tournament Among Remaining Teams Assume (for contradiction) that every pair among these 9 teams has played a match—this would mean these 9 teams completed a round-robin tournament among themselves. Step 5: Calculate the Number of Matches in a Round-robin Tournament - A round-robin tournament among 9 teams requires each team to play every other team once. - The total number of such matches is given by the combination formula ( binom{9}{2} ): [ binom{9}{2} = frac{9 cdot 8}{2} = 36 ] Step 6: Determine the Possible Matches in 8 Rounds Each round consists of 9 matches since 18 teams are divided into pairs: [ 9 text{ matches per round} times 8 text{ rounds} = 72 text{ matches in total} ] Out of these, a maximum of 4 matches can occur per round among any selected subset of 9 teams: [ 9 left( text{teams} right)/2 = 4.5 implies 4 , text{full matches per round}. ] Thus, these 9 teams can play among themselves: [ 4 , (text{matches per round}) times 8 , (text{rounds}) = 32 text{ matches in total} ] Step 7: Verify the Feasibility To conduct 36 matches among these 9 teams, they would have needed more than the 8 rounds (since only 32 matches could have been played among the 9 teams in these 8 rounds). Thus, we get a contradiction because only 32 matches, not 36, are possible within 8 rounds. Conclusion Since it is not possible for all pairs among the 9 teams not played with A to have played each other, there must be at least one pair among these 9 teams that has not played any match among themselves. Consequently, this ensures that there exists a trio of teams (A, B, C) (where B, C are some of the 9 teams) that have not played any match among themselves during the 8 rounds. Therefore, indeed there exist three teams that have not played any match among themselves.

In each of these partitions, only one cell in each part is marked to ensure no two marked cells share a vertex. # Conclusion By analyzing the structure and symmetry of the cube, it can be concluded that the maximum number of cells that can be marked so that no two marked cells share a common vertex is: [ boxed{14} ]"},{"prompt":"Calculate the number of revolutions of a wheel, with a fixed center and an outside diameter of 10 feet, required for a point on the rim to travel half a mile.

The common ratio q can be found using the formula for the n-th term of a geometric sequence: frac{a_n}{a_1} = q^{n-1}. In this case, we have two pairs of terms and their respective positions in the sequence: (a_2+1, a_2) and (a_4+1, a_4). We can use these to find q. 2.

Now that we have q, we can find a_6+1 using the formula for the n-th term of a geometric sequence again: a_n = a_1 times q^{n-1}. In this case, we want to find the sixth term of the sequence {a_{n}+1}, so we use (a_4+1) as our starting point: a_6+1 = (a_4+1) times q^{6-4} = (15+1) times 4 = 64. 4.

Our objective is to prove that among these three lines, there exist two that are parallel. 2. **Intersection point**: Since the lines (e_1, e_2,) and (e_3) are distinct and not all parallel, at least two of them must intersect. Assume lines (e_1) and (e_2) intersect at point (M). 3. **Translation of line (e_3)**: Translate line (e_3) parallel to itself such that it now passes through the intersection point (M). Let this translated line be denoted as (e). Note that for parallel translation, the angle of inclination with any plane remains unchanged. Therefore, (e) also makes a (45^circ) angle with plane (S_2). 4. **Intersection points with (S_2)**: Let the points where (e_1), (e_2), and (e) intersect the plane (S_2) be (E_1), (E_2), and (E) respectively.

It turns out that the segments are colored in three colors in such a way that three segments of different colors converge at each marked point. Prove that the segments connected to the vertices of the triangle are colored in different colors.","completion":"1. Let the number of marked points inside the triangle be ( n ). 2. Suppose that among the three segments connecting the vertices of the triangle to the marked points, we have ( k_1 ) segments of the first color, ( k_2 ) segments of the second color, and ( k_3 ) segments of the third color. It's given that: [ k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 3 quad text{and} quad 0 leq k_i leq 3 ] 3. We proceed by counting the total number of segments in each color. Let’s consider the total number of segments of the first color. Every point inside the triangle has three segments of different colors converging at it. Therefore, the total number of first-color segments, counting those connecting a marked point with a vertex of the triangle is: [ frac{n + k_1}{2} ] Similarly, for the second and third colors: [ frac{n + k_2}{2} quad text{and} quad frac{n + k_3}{2} ] 4. This formula accounts for the fact that when we add up the total number of colored segments converging at each point, we count each segment twice (once at each endpoint). 5. The numerators of these fractions (( n + k_1, n + k_2, n + k_3 )) must all be even. Therefore, ( k_1, k_2, k_3 ) must all have the same parity (they must be all odd or all even). 6. Given that the sum ( k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 3 ), they must all be odd numbers because 3 is an odd number. The only way to achieve this is for ( k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = 1 ). 7. This configuration confirms that each vertex of the triangle is connected to a marked point by a segment of a different color. 8. We have implicitly shown that a coloring scheme where all marked points inside the triangle ensure that the segments connected to the triangle’s vertices are of different colors is valid only if the number of marked points is odd. Hence, this proves that such a coloring is impossible when the number of points is even. 9. Therefore, the segments connecting the vertices of the triangle must be colored in different colors.

Solution: 1. **Stating the Problem for a Plane:** - In a convex angle, for any interior point P, one can draw a line such that the segment between the arms of the angle is bisected by point P. 2. **Construction by Reflection:** - Reflect one of the angle's arms about point P. Due to convexity, the reflected ray intersects the other arm. Let's denote this intersection point as one endpoint of the segment. 3. **Drawing the Line:** - Connect this intersection point with P; this line will bisect the segment connecting the arms of the angle at P. 4. **Applying this Result to 3D:** - Consider a convex polyhedral angle (hedron) formed by four rays vec{a}, vec{b}, vec{c}, vec{d} meeting at vertex P. 5. **Construct Convex Angle Intersection:** - Take the two convex angles formed by opposite pairs of rays. The intersection of these angles is a single ray. 6. **Selecting a Point:** - Choose any point K on this ray. This point will act as the center of the parallelogram. 7. **Utilize Previous Result in Each Section:** - Apply the previous 2D result to the two convex angles involving K. 8. **Formation of Parallelogram:** - This establishes four points lying in two planes intersecting at K. The quadrilateral formed will be a parallelogram due to their symmetry from K and the midpoint property. Hence, a parallelogram cross-section is formed. # II. Solution: 1. **Defining Vectors:** - Consider a convex polyhedral angle with vertex P from which rays emanate in directions vec{a}, vec{b}, vec{c}, vec{d}. 2. **Positive Combination:** - Let alpha be any positive real number. From vector space theory (basis), any vector in space can be expressed as a linear combination of three non-coplanar vectors. 3. **Choosing Non-Coplanar Vectors:** - Vectors vec{b}, vec{d}, -vec{c} are non-coplanar. Thus, alpha vec{a} can be expressed as a combination: [ alpha vec{a} = beta vec{b} + delta vec{d} + gamma (-vec{c}). ] 4. **Forming Equation:** - Rearrange: [ gamma vec{c} - delta vec{d} = beta vec{b} - alpha vec{a}. ] 5. **Vectored Parallelism:** - Both sides of this equation represent vectors that must be parallel. Additionally, since these vectors lie along the rays forming the polyhedral angle, they describe a planar intersection. 6. **Planar Section:** - The quadrilateral formed by endpoints of these vectors in the section plane is a parallelogram. This follows from properties of vectors forming equal, opposite pairs and sharing midpoint properties. Thus, any convex polyhedral angle has a section that forms a parallelogram.

The factorial (2004!) is the product of all positive integers up to (2004). This means that (2004!) is divisible by every integer from (1) to (2004). 2. Consider the sequence of numbers (2004! + 2, 2004! + 3, ldots, 2004! + 2004). Each of these numbers can be written as (2004! + k) where (2 leq k leq 2004). Since (2004!) is divisible by (k), (2004! + k) is also divisible by (k). Therefore, none of these numbers can be prime because they all have a divisor other than (1) and themselves. 3. Next, we use the given fact that there are (168) primes less than (1000). This means that in the set of the first (1000) positive integers, there are (168) primes. 4.

Since (p(n)) changes by at most (1) as (n) increases and (p(1) geq 150) while (p(2004! + 2) < 150), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be some (n) in the range from (1) to (2004! + 2) such that (p(n) = 150).

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Initial Arrangement**: We start by arranging the books of one subject, say math books. There are 3 math books, and they can be arranged in {A}_{3}^{3} ways. Since {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6, there are 6 ways to arrange the math books. 2. **Arranging the Second Set of Books**: Now, we need to arrange the Chinese books in such a way that they are not adjacent to each other. To do this, we can place each Chinese book in the gaps between the math books or at the ends of the row. For the first Chinese book, there are 4 positions (before the first math book, between the first and second, between the second and third, and after the third math book). After placing the first Chinese book, we proceed to place the second and third, following the same principle. Since we are arranging 3 Chinese books in 3 specific positions (the gaps created by placing the first Chinese book), this can be done in {A}_{3}^{3} ways. Again, {A}_{3}^{3} = 3! = 6. 3. **Combining the Arrangements**: Since we can start with either the math books or the Chinese books, there are 2 choices for the first set of books to arrange. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is given by multiplying the number of ways to arrange each set of books and the choice of which set to start with. This gives us 2 times {A}_{3}^{3} times {A}_{3}^{3} = 2 times 6 times 6. 4. **Final Calculation**: Performing the multiplication, we get 2 times 6 times 6 = 12 times 6 = 72.

Given that x > 1, it follows that m < dfrac{xln x + x}{x - 1} must hold true for any x > 1. Define the function h(x) = dfrac{xln x + x}{x - 1}. To determine the behavior of h(x), we calculate its derivative: h'(x) = dfrac{x-ln x-2}{(x-1)^2} Let varphi(x) = x - ln x - 2 for x > 1. Its derivative is: varphi'(x) = 1 - dfrac{1}{x} = dfrac{x-1}{x} > 0 This indicates that varphi(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval (1, +infty). Given that varphi(3) = 1 - ln 3 < 0 and varphi(4) = 2 - 2ln 2 > 0, we can deduce that the equation varphi(x) = 0 has a unique real root x_0 in the interval (3, 4). For 1 < x < x_0, varphi(x) < 0, which implies h'(x) < 0. For x > x_0, varphi(x) > 0, which implies h'(x) > 0. This tells us that the function h(x) is monotonically decreasing on (1, x_0) and monotonically increasing on (x_0, +infty). Thus, the minimum value of h(x) is at h(x_0) = dfrac{x_0(1 + x_0 - 2)}{x_0 - 1} = x_0, with x_0 in (3, 4). Therefore, we have m < boxed{x_0} and since x_0 in (3,4), the maximum integer value for m is boxed{3}. Thus, the correct choice is B. In conclusion, the problem is translated into the task of finding a positive integer m such that m < dfrac{xln x + x}{x - 1} for any x in (1, +infty), and this is accomplished by determining the minimum value of the function h(x) using its derivative. Finding the minimum value of the function h(x) is key to solving this question, which involves understanding the application of derivatives to study the monotonicity of a function and the transformation of mathematical problems.

What is the maximum value that N can take?","completion":"To find the maximum number of islands ( N ) in the given archipelago, we need to consider some fundamental properties of graph theory since each island and bridge can be thought of as vertices and edges in a graph. 1. **Conditions Recap:** - Any two islands are connected by at most one bridge. - Each island connects with no more than 5 bridges. - Among any 7 islands, there exists at least one pair of islands connected by a bridge. 2. **Possible Configuration:** - The number of islands ( N ) can be theoretically up to 36, setting it such that they form groups of 6 islands each, where any two islands in the same group are connected by a bridge. This can be accomplished by: - Dividing ( N ) islands into groups where each group has exactly 6 islands. - Each island within a group is connected to all other islands in the same group (a complete graph or ( K_6 ) within each group). 3. **Detailed Verification:** - For a configuration where there are groups fully interconnected within but not between groups, each island must have exactly 5 bridges, aligning with the constraint given. - Any set of 7 islands must include at least one full group of 6 islands. In such a selection, if we have 6 from a single group and an extra one, there is always a connected pair within the 6. 4. **Proof by Contradiction:** - Suppose ( N geq 37 ). Then at least one island connects with another island as mentioned by the constraints. - Choose an island ( A ). Island ( A ) can connect to at most 5 other islands. Temporarily ignore these connected islands. We now consider ( N - 6 geq 31 ) islands (those not connected to ( A )). - Repeat this procedure for another island ( B ), continuing until we choose up to 6 islands (( A, B, ldots, F )). - At each step, we ignore another set of islands connected to each chosen island. After considering up to 36 connections (6 islands each potentially connecting 5 other islands), we would still have at least one island left ( G ). - Now we have 7 islands: ( A, B, C, D, E, F, G ). Since ( G ) is not connected to ( A ) through ( F ) by bridges (it remains disconnected as per the selection). This forms a set of 7 islands without a connecting pair, contradicting the initial condition that every subset of 7 islands must contain a connected pair. Thus, the maximum number of islands ( N ) that can exist in this archipelago under the given constraints is verified to be 36.

Therefore: [ v = left(frac{alpha}{2pi}right) times V ] 4. Plugging in the volume (V) of the sphere: [ v = left(frac{alpha}{2pi}right) times frac{4}{3} pi = frac{4alpha}{6} = frac{2alpha}{3} ] 5. If (r) is the radius of a sphere with volume (v), then its volume can be expressed as: [ v = frac{4}{3} pi r^3 ] 6. Equating the expressions for (v), we obtain: [ frac{4}{3} pi r^3 = frac{2 alpha}{3} ] 7. Solving for (r): [ r^3 = frac{2 alpha / 3}{4pi / 3} ] Simplify the expression: [ r^3 = frac{2alpha}{4pi} ] [ r^3 = frac{alpha}{2pi} ] 8.

This implies that each polygon is relatively small compared to the original square. 2. **Characterizing the Polygons**: - Let M and M' represent two adjacent polygons in this subdivision. - If there are gaps or \\"holes\\" between M and M' filled by other polygons (as illustrated in Figure 116), merging these gaps with M leads to a larger polygon. 3. **Merging Adjacent Polygons**: - Sequentially merge M with all its neighbors and the gaps between them. This results in a larger polygon bar{M}. - Proceed similarly for all polygons and their neighbors to create a new subdivision where no \\"holes\\" or gaps exist between adjacent polygons. 4. **Ensuring Boundaries Consist of Single Segments**: - In this new subdivision, the shared boundary between any two polygons consists of a single contiguous segment (no gaps or voids). 5. **Bounding the Size of the New Polygons**: - Since each smaller original polygon fits within a circle of diameter frac{1}{sqrt{30}}, the newly formed larger polygon through sequential merging also must fit within an appropriately sized circle. 6. **Existence of a Central Polygon**: - Define M_0 as the polygon in the new subdivision that covers the center O of the original square. - Label M_0 as a first-layer polygon. Define the second-layer polygons as those adjacent to M_0, third-layer polygons as those adjacent to any second-layer polygons, and so on. 7. **Iterating through Layers**: - Observe that M_0 fits inside a circle of radius frac{1}{10} with center O. - All second-layer polygons fit within a circle of radius frac{2}{10} centered at O. - Similarly, third-layer polygons fit within a circle of radius frac{3}{10} and fourth-layer polygons fit within a circle of radius frac{4}{10} centered at O. 8. **Conclusion**: - It follows that a polygon within the first four layers cannot extend to the boundary of the original square. - Given the constraints on the sizes and placements of these polygons, at least one of them from the original subdivision must have at least six neighbors.

For any ( k < 0 ), it is always possible to find a point (and not just one!) whose power with respect to this circle is equal to ( +k ). However, it is not always possible to find a point whose power would be equal to ( k ). Why?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: A circle of radius 1 is given, and for any negative number ( k ) (i.e., ( k < 0 )), it is claimed that there always exists a point both inside and outside the circle with a point, the power of which with respect to the circle equals ( +k ). However, it is not always possible to find a point whose power would be (-k). We need to explain why. 2. **Power of a Point**: Let's recall the definition of the power of a point ( P ) with respect to a circle centered at ( O ) with radius ( R ). The power is defined as: [ text{Power}(P) = OP^2 - R^2 ] where ( OP ) is the distance from the point ( P ) to the center of the circle. 3. **Points Outside the Circle**: For points outside the circle: - If ( OP = d > R ), then the power: [ text{Power}(P) = d^2 - 1 ] This is always positive since ( d ) is larger than 1 (because the radius ( R ) is 1). 4. **Points Inside the Circle**: For points inside the circle: - If ( OP = d < R ), then the power: [ text{Power}(P) = d^2 - 1 ] This is always negative since ( d ) is less than 1. 5. **Points On the Circle**: For points exactly on the circle: - If ( OP = R ), then the power: [ text{Power}(P) = 1 - 1 = 0 ] This is exactly zero. 6. **Finding Points with Positive Power ( +k )**: - For ( k < 0 ), ( +k ) is negative. - To have ( +k ) power, the point must be inside the circle since any point inside the circle ( (d < 1) ) will have: [ d^2 - 1 = +k quad text{(where } k text{ is negative)} ] Solving for ( d ), we see ( d ) will be less than 1, satisfying the condition. 7. **Finding Points with Negative Power ( -k )**: - Now, consider ( -k ). For ( k < 0 ), ( -k ) is positive. - To have ( -k ) power, the point must be outside the circle since any point outside will lead to: [ d^2 - 1 = -k quad text{(where } -k text{ is positive)} ] For ( d ) to be more than 1. 8. **Why It Fails for Certain Values of ( k )**: - However, the absolute possible minimum power of points inside the circle is at the center (( O )): [ OP = 0 implies text{Power}(O) = 0^2 - 1 = -1 ] This shows that the most negative power within the circle is (-1). - For (-k) to be valid, ( k ) must be such that (-k leq -1 implies k geq 1). - Thus, if (-k > -1 implies k < 1), a corresponding point cannot exist within the circle since the power cannot reach such negative values. # Conclusion: Hence, it is always possible to find a point with ( +k ) power because ( k ) being negative makes ( +k ) negative, which fits inside the circle. However, finding a point with ( -k ) power is not always possible because ( -k ) becomes hard to achieve for ( k > -1 ), as inside the circle power, the minimum bound is (-1). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"A convex polyhedron has exactly three edges extending from each vertex. It is known that all but one face of the polyhedron have a circumscribed circle. Prove that all faces of the polyhedron have a circumscribed circle.","completion":"1. **Definition of the exceptional face:** Let's denote the face that does not have a known circumscribed circle as the exceptional face. Let us examine the vertices that are not on this exceptional face. 2. **Considering vertices away from the exceptional face:** Let A be a vertex that is not part of the exceptional face. From A, three edges emanate, whose endpoints, along with A, form a tetrahedron. This tetrahedron has a circumscribed sphere G_A by the properties of tetrahedrons. 3. **Intersection of the sphere with the polyhedron:** The three faces of the polyhedron that contain vertex A will each intersect the sphere G_A in a circle. These circles contain at least three vertices of the corresponding faces, implying that they are actually the circles circumscribing these faces. Consequently, all vertices on the faces containing A (including those potentially on the exceptional face) lie on G_A. 4. **Analysis with additional vertices:** Let B and C be two vertices that are not on the exceptional face, and let BC be an edge of the polyhedron. By the previous steps, let G_B and G_C denote the spheres associated with B and C respectively. The faces containing BC will have their circumscribing circles lie on both G_B and G_C. Since two circles intersecting in a non-planar manner determine a unique sphere, G_B and G_C must be the same sphere. 5. **Connectivity and propagation of property:** The graph formed by the edges of the polyhedron (even if edges on the exceptional face are omitted) is connected. Therefore, all vertices that are not on the exceptional face must lie on a common sphere G. If a vertex lies next to another vertex not on the exceptional face, it too lies on G. Since every vertex on the exceptional face is connected to at least one other vertex not on that face, all vertices of the polyhedron lie on G. 6. **Conclusion for the exceptional face:** Therefore, every vertex of the exceptional face is on the intersection of the plane of that face and G, meaning the exceptional face has a circumscribed circle as well. Consequently, all faces of the convex polyhedron, including the exceptional face, have a circumscribed circle. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given two sets A = {x | x^2 2x 3 leq 0} and B = {x | x^2 2mx + m^2 4 leq 0, x in mathbb{R}, m in mathbb{R}}.

The solution set for this inequality A is then: A = {x | -1 leq x leq 3}. For set B, we solve the inequality x^2 - 2mx + m^2 - 4 leq 0. This is a quadratic equation in x where the discriminant is (2m)^2 - 4(m^2 - 4) = 16. Since the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots, which means the inequality holds for an interval between those roots. The roots are at x = m pm 2 since the quadratic can be factored as (x - (m - 2))(x - (m + 2)) leq 0. The solution set for B is then: B = {x | m - 2 leq x leq m + 2}.

This is because as x becomes larger, frac{k}{x} becomes smaller, and as x becomes more negative (but less in absolute value), frac{k}{x} becomes less negative (but larger in absolute value). 2.

For x=-3 (which corresponds to y_1), x=-1 (which corresponds to y_2), and x=1 (which corresponds to y_3), we see that as we move from x=-3 to x=-1 and then to x=1, y should decrease because x is increasing.

The New York masters claim their city meets this criterion, while masters from the West Coast argue that a city located at the center of gravity of all players would be better.","completion":"# Problem: New York has more chess masters than the entirety of the remaining USA. A chess tournament is being planned involving all masters. It has been decided that the tournament should be held at a location that minimizes the total travel distance of all participants. The masters from New York claim that their city satisfies this criterion, while the masters from the West Coast insist that the tournament should be held in a city situated in the center of gravity of the group of players. Where should the tournament be held? Let's denote the chess masters from New York as ( N_1, N_2, ldots, N_k ) and the remaining players as ( O_1, O_2, ldots, O_t ). Since there are more players in New York than in the rest of the USA, we have ( k > t ). To solve this problem, we start by analyzing the total travel distance if the tournament is held in New York. Consider pairs of players ((N_1, O_1), (N_2, O_2), ldots, (N_t, O_t)). The New York masters (N_{t+1}, N_{t+2}, ldots, N_k) do not fall into any pair. Examine a pair ((N_1, O_1)). Regardless of the chosen city for the tournament, the total travel distance for masters (N_1) and (O_1) is at least the direct distance between (N_1) and (O_1). Hence, the overall travel distance for all pairs is: [ S = N_1 O_1 + N_2 O_2 + cdots + N_t O_t ] If the tournament is held in New York, (S) represents the travel distance sum. If it's held in another location, travel distances will not be less than ( S ), plus the additional distance for masters (N_{t+1}, N_{t+2}, ldots, N_k), will increase the overall sum. Thus, New York minimizes the sum of travel distances for the majority of participants. An analogous situation with n points ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) aligns the result with the sum of distances minimized at a midpoint interval. For odd (n), the minimum sum is achieved at point ( x_{frac{n+1}{2}} ). Therefore, the tournament should be held in New York, providing the optimal location based on travel distance minimization.

First, let's consider the total number of ways Kim can select 2 shoes out of 14. This can be calculated using combinations, since the order in which she selects the shoes does not matter. The number of combinations of selecting 2 shoes from 14 is given by: C(14, 2) = 14! / (2! * (14 - 2)!) = 14! / (2! * 12!) = (14 * 13) / (2 * 1) = 91 Now, let's calculate the number of ways Kim can select 2 shoes of the same color. Since she has 7 pairs of shoes and each pair is a different color, there are 7 possible pairs she could select. For each pair, there is only 1 way to select 2 shoes of the same color (since there are only 2 shoes of each color). Therefore, there are 7 ways to select 2 shoes of the same color. The probability that Kim selects 2 shoes of the same color is then the number of successful outcomes (selecting 2 shoes of the same color) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (selecting any 2 shoes): Probability = Number of successful outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes Probability = 7 / 91 To simplify the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 7: Probability = 1 / 13 So, the probability that Kim will select 2 shoes of the same color is boxed{1/13} ."},{"prompt":"Given the proposition P: exists x in mathbb{R}, e^{x}x1 leqslant 0, the proposition neg P:( ) A: forall x in mathbb{R}, e^{x}x1 > 0 B: forall x notin mathbb{R}, e^{x}x1 > 0 C: forall x in mathbb{R}, e^{x}x1 geqslant 0 D: exists x in mathbb{R}, e^{x}x1 > 0","completion":"This problem tests our understanding of the negation of propositions involving quantifiers.

Prove that there exists a line that separates all the red points from all the black points.","completion":"1. **Initial Considerations:** We need to prove that there exists a line in a plane with finite red and black points such that all red points are separated from all black points. It is essential to note that the problem assumption implies that any four points, two red and two black, can be separated by a line. However, the problem is slightly imprecise because if there are only three points, there might not be a line to separate them all (e.g., if two points are red (A and B) and one is black (C) with C inside the segment AB). Hence, we assume there are at least four points. 2. **Convex Hull Definition:** The convex hull of a set of points in a plane is the smallest convex set containing those points. For a finite set of points, the convex hull forms a convex polygon (triangle, line segment, or single point). 3. **Separation by Convex Hulls:** Realize that if a line can separate all red points from all black points, it can also separate the convex hulls of the red and black points. Thus, the original statement about separating points is equivalent to stating that the convex hulls of the red and black points can be separated by a line. 4. **Disjoint Convex Hulls:** Assume that the red (R) and black (B) convex hulls are not disjoint. We first consider the case where the boundaries of these convex hulls intersect. This means either their edges or vertices intersect, which would invalidate our initial assumption about any four points being separable by a line. To illustrate, if two red points and two black points form intersecting segments or share a common vertex, there cannot exist a line separating these four points. 5. **Contained Convex Hulls:** Suppose one convex hull is completely inside the other. If, for instance, the black convex hull contains the red one, then split this polygon into non-intersecting triangles. One of these triangles must contain a red point either in its interior or on the boundary. With all vertices of this triangle being black points, this contradicts the given condition for any four points to be separable by a line. Consequently, the convex hulls of red and black points do not overlap or contain each other. 6. **Separation by Perpendicular Bisector:** Next, we prove there exists a line dividing the two convex hulls. Identify the shortest distance between any point in the red convex hull and any point in the black convex hull. Let A (red) and B (black) be the points such that the distance AB is minimal. We claim the perpendicular bisector of AB will separate the two convex hulls. Assume the contrary, where this bisector does not separate the hulls. Therefore, there exists a point C within the red convex hull such that it lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. 7. **Contradiction:** The line segment AC lies entirely within the red convex hull. Consider the orthogonal projection of B onto AC, denoted as T. Given that angle BAC is acute, T lies within AC. Note that BT < BA, contradicting the assumption that AB was the shortest distance between points on the two convex hulls. 8. **Conclusion:** This contradiction confirms that the perpendicular bisector of the minimum distance indeed separates the convex hulls. Therefore, such a line exists separating the entire sets of red and black points. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given f(x)=ln x, g(x)=frac{1}{2}x^2+mx+frac{7}{2} (m<0), the line l is tangent to the graph of f(x) at x=1 and is also tangent to the graph of g(x). 1.

Prove that tr({{A}^{*}})ne 1 if and only if the matrix {{I}_{n}}+{{A}^{*}} is invertible.","completion":"To prove that ( text{tr}(A^*) ne -1 ) if and only if the matrix ( I_n + A^* ) is invertible, we will consider different cases based on the rank of matrix ( A ). 1. **Case 1: ( n = 2 )** Let ( A = begin{bmatrix} a & b c & d end{bmatrix} ). The adjugate matrix ( A^* ) is given by: [ A^* = begin{bmatrix} d & -b -c & a end{bmatrix} ] The determinant of ( I + A^* ) is: [ det(I + A^*) = det begin{bmatrix} 1 + d & -b -c & 1 + a end{bmatrix} ] By direct computation, we have: [ det(I + A^*) = (1 + d)(1 + a) - (-b)(-c) = 1 + a + d + ad - bc ] Since ( A ) is not invertible, ( det(A) = ad - bc = 0 ). Therefore: [ det(I + A^*) = 1 + a + d ] This determinant is nonzero if and only if ( a + d ne -1 ). Since ( text{tr}(A^*) = a + d ), we conclude that ( text{tr}(A^*) ne -1 ) if and only if ( I + A^* ) is invertible. 2. **Case 2: ( n ge 3 ) and ( text{rank}(A) le n-2 )** If ( text{rank}(A) le n-2 ), then any ( n-1 ) rows of ( A ) are linearly dependent. This implies that any ( (n-1) times (n-1) ) submatrix of ( A ) has dependent rows, and hence ( A^* = 0 ). In this case: [ text{tr}(A^*) = 0 ne -1 ] and: [ I + A^* = I ] which is clearly invertible. Thus, ( text{tr}(A^*) ne -1 ) if and only if ( I + A^* ) is invertible. 3. **Case 3: ( n ge 3 ) and ( text{rank}(A) = n-1 )** Since ( text{rank}(A) = n-1 ), the null space of ( A ) is one-dimensional. Every column of ( A^* ) lies within the null space of ( A ), implying ( text{rank}(A^*) = 1 ). Let ( B = A^* ). For rank 1 matrices, we have: [ B^2 = (text{tr}(B))B ] This means the algebra generated by ( B ) consists of ( text{span}{I, B} ). If ( I + B ) is invertible, it must lie within this algebra. Suppose the inverse of ( I + B ) is of the form ( I + alpha B ). Then: [ (I + B)(I + alpha B) = I + (1 + alpha)B + alpha (text{tr}(B))B = I + (1 + alpha + alpha text{tr}(B))B ] For this to equal ( I ), we must have: [ 1 + alpha + alpha text{tr}(B) = 0 implies alpha (1 + text{tr}(B)) = -1 ] If ( text{tr}(B) = -1 ), there is no solution for ( alpha ), and ( I + B ) is not invertible. If ( text{tr}(B) ne -1 ), we can solve for: [ alpha = frac{-1}{1 + text{tr}(B)} ] and verify that ( I + alpha B ) is indeed the inverse of ( I + B ).

Can the equality (left(a_{1}b_{1}right) ldotsleft(a_{2015}b_{2015}right)=2017^{2016} ) hold true?","completion":"1. We start by noting the given conditions. The sequences (a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{2015}) and (b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{2015}) are both permutations of the same set of integers. 2. Consider the product ( prod_{i=1}^{2015} (a_i - b_i) = 2017^{2016} ). 3. Since (2017 = 2 times 1008 + 1), it follows that 2017 is an odd number. Hence (2017^{2016}) is also odd (since the power of an odd number remains odd). 4. Therefore, each term (a_i - b_i) must be an odd integer because the product of any number of even integers cannot be odd – it would be even. 5. Next, we derive an important property of odd integers: the sum of an odd number of odd integers results in an odd sum. Essentially, - Let odd integers be defined as ( a_{i} = 2k_{i} + 1 ) and ( b_{i} = 2m_{i} + 1 ) for integers ( k_{i} ) and ( m_{i} ). Then ( a_{i} - b_{i} = (2k_{i} + 1) - (2m_{i} + 1) = 2(k_{i} - m_{i}) ). 6. Given that the lists (a_i) and (b_i) are permutations of one another, we have, [ sum_{i=1}^{2015} a_i = sum_{i=1}^{2015} b_i implies sum_{i=1}^{2015} (a_i - b_i) = 0 ] 7. The only way the sum of the differences that are all odd can be zero is if there's an equal number of positive and negative values. But the requirement for the differences being odd and summing to zero is not possible because an odd number of terms cannot balance to zero. 8. Therefore, the assumption that ( prod_{i=1}^{2015} (a_i - b_i) = 2017^{2016} ) contradicts the essential properties of odd numbers and permutations. **Conclusion:** [ boxed{text{No, it cannot be true.}} ]"},{"prompt":"John decides to start collecting art from different countries.

Let's proceed step-by-step: 1. **Order of 2 in Factorials** - From a known theorem, the order of 2 in factorial ( n! ) is given by: [ operatorname{ord}_{2}(n!) = n - S_2(n) ] where ( S_2(n) ) is the sum of binary digits (Hamming weight) of ( n ). 2. **Applying the Theorem** - Applying this to our problem, we analyze the order of 2 in: [ frac{(kn)!}{n!} ] Using the relation: [ operatorname{ord}_{2}left( frac{(kn)!}{n!} right) = operatorname{ord}_{2}((kn)!) - operatorname{ord}_{2}(n!) ] [ = (kn - S_2(kn)) - (n - S_2(n)) ] Simplifying: [ operatorname{ord}_{2}left( frac{(kn)!}{n!} right) = (k-1)n + S_2(n) - S_2(kn) ] 3. **Inequality Analysis** - For the given condition ( 2^{(k-1)n+1} ) to divide ( frac{(kn)!}{n!} ), the power of 2 must satisfy: [ operatorname{ord}_{2}left( frac{(kn)!}{n!} right) geq (k-1)n + 1 ] Substituting the expression from above: [ (k-1)n + S_2(n) - S_2(kn) geq (k-1)n + 1 ] Simplifying this: [ S_2(n) - S_2(kn) geq 1 ] Or, [ S_2(kn) leq S_2(n) - 1 quadtext{(which must hold for all ( n ))} ] 4. **Binary Representation and ( S_2 )** - A crucial observation here is that ( k ) must be of the form a power of 2. Let's consider ( k = 2^s ) (for some integer ( s )): - In binary, multiplying a number by ( 2^s ) appends ( s ) zeros to the end of its binary representation. [ S_2(kn) = S_2(2^s cdot n) = S_2(n) ] 5. **Validating the Condition** - For ( k = 2^s ): [ S_2(kn) = S_2(n) ] Thus, the inequality [ S_2(kn) leq S_2(n) - 1 ] fails unless (n) has a proper binary form that keeps ( S_2 ) maintained without decrement. 6. **Conclusion** - For the inequality ( S_2(kn) leq S_2(n) ) to always hold, the only way it is consistently satisfied is if ( kn ) doesn't modify ( S_2(n)) i.e., part of maintaining equality. - Hence, the possible ( k ) values must be only powers of 2. # Conclusion: Therefore, the solution to the problem is that the possible values of ( k ) are: [ boxed{k = 2^s text{ (where ( s ) is a non-negative integer)}} ]"},{"prompt":"a kilometer race, A beats B by some meters or 12 seconds.

For which initial positions can all three bricks be moved to the same point with a suitable sequence of steps?","completion":"To determine for which initial positions all three bricks on the real line can be moved to the same point, we must analyze the conditions and constraints of the problem. Specifically, we observe how the problem's constraints dictate the movement and final alignment of the bricks. 1. **Conserving the Sum of Coordinates**: - Let the coordinates of the three bricks be (a), (b), and (c). The sum of the coordinates is (S = a + b + c). - In one step, if we move one brick 1 unit to the left and the other 1 unit to the right, the sum (S) remains unchanged. Hence, (S mod 3) is invariant through every step. 2. **Final Coordinate Configuration**: - If the three bricks are to be moved to the same point (n), then (a = b = c = n). The sum in this configuration is (3n). Therefore, (S) must be divisible by 3 for (S) to equal (3n) where (n) is an integer. 3. **Constructing a Valid Sequence**: - Suppose (S) is divisible by 3, i.e., (S = 3n) for some integer (n). - Select one brick and move it to the point (n). - Assume this brick is initially at coordinate (x). Move it to coordinate (n). Each step will involve moving the brick (1) unit closer to (n) while moving another brick further from or closer to retain symmetry. 4. **Reaching the Configuration ( (n, n - a, n + a) )**: - The other two bricks must, through some sequence of moves, be positioned symmetrically around (n). Thus, after moving one brick to (n), the other two bricks are at coordinates (n-a) and (n+a). - To align these two to (n), each move will decrement/increment (a) by 1 till (a) reduces to (0). 5. **Explicit Verification**: - Note that any sequence of moving bricks while preserving (S) has the property that the distance between the largest and smallest coordinates decreases (since (a) symmetrically collapses to (0)). - Consequently, when they align on (n), it validates divisibility condition (S = 3n). # Approach for the Reverse Direction: 1. **Maximizing Distance Reduction**: - As long as there is a gap of at least 2 units between the furthest apart bricks, one can always move the brick on the leftmost coordinate 1 unit to the right and the brick on the rightmost coordinate 1 unit to the left. This reduces the distance between the extreme bricks. - This iterative reduction will eventually bring all bricks into two neighboring points due to the invariant (S). 2. **Alignment on the Same Point Given (S equiv 0 mod 3)**: - Since the invariant (S mod 3) must balance when the distance collapses, it implies they coalesce on a single point. Thus, initial positions satisfy the condition if and only if the invariant sum of coordinates is divisible by 3.

This will divide the ( n )-gon into ( n ) equal triangles. - For example, in a regular hexagon (( n = 6 )), drawing diagonals from one vertex to all other non-adjacent vertices divides the hexagon into 6 equal triangles. 3. **Consider odd ( n )**: - Label the vertices ( V_1, V_2, V_3, ldots, V_n ) in clockwise order. - Consider the shortest diagonal that is drawn, say ( V_1 V_{i+1} ) where ( i le frac{n-1}{2} ). - Notice that the triangle which contains the side ( V_1V_2 ) must also have a side contained in ( V_1 V_{i+1} ). An analogous thing holds for ( V_iV_{i+1} ). - If the triangle which contains ( V_1 V_2 ) is not isosceles, then the diagonals of shortest length must pair up the vertices (e.g., ( (V_1, V_{i+1}) ) is one pair). This is absurd. 4. **Analyze the diagonals**: - All diagonals of the form ( V_j V_{j+i} ) are drawn, for ( 1 le j le n ) (indices modulo ( n )). - If ( i = 2 ), then it's easy to see that this fails. - If ( i = frac{n-1}{2} ), it's easy to see that there is an ( n )-gon in the center of the polygon, which is absurd. - Else, suppose that ( 2 < i < frac{n-1}{2} ). Note that the diagonals ( V_1 V_{i+1} ) and ( V_2 V_{i+2} ) intersect at an angle of ( frac{2 pi}{n} ). Therefore, one angle of the triangle which \\"tiles\\" the polygon is at most ( frac{2pi}{n} ). 5. **Check for specific ( i )**: - By looking at the triangle containing ( V_1 V_2 ), this implies that ( i = 3 ). - But then, it's easily checked that the triangle bounded by ( V_1 V_4, V_2 V_5, V_3V_6 ) is smaller than that bounded by ( V_1V_4, V_{n-1}V_2, V_1 V_2 ).

The reaction is a chlorination reaction and can be represented as follows: CH4 + Cl2 → CH3Cl + HCl From the balanced equation, we can see that for every mole of CH4 that reacts, one mole of HCl is produced. It is also evident that for every mole of Cl2 that reacts, one mole of HCl is produced. Given that 3 moles of CH4 are reacting, we can expect 3 moles of HCl to be produced if there is enough Cl2 present. However, the problem states that the number of moles of HCl formed is equal to the number of moles of Cl2. Let's denote the number of moles of Cl2 as x. According to the problem, the number of moles of HCl formed is also x. Since the number of moles of HCl cannot exceed the number of moles of CH4 reacted (which is 3 moles), and the number of moles of HCl is equal to the number of moles of Cl2, we can conclude that x (the number of moles of Cl2) must be equal to or less than 3 moles. However, since the problem does not specify any limitation on the amount of Cl2, we will assume that there is enough Cl2 to react with all 3 moles of CH4.

Since the trains are of equal length and the faster train is overtaking the slower one, we can consider the relative speed at which the faster train is approaching the slower train. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds, which is: Relative speed = Speed of faster train - Speed of slower train Relative speed = 44 km/hr - 36 km/hr Relative speed = 8 km/hr To work with the time given in seconds, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to km/sec. 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, 8 km/hr = 8 km / 3600 sec Now, we convert km/hr to km/sec: 8 km/hr = 8 / 3600 km/sec 8 km/hr = 0.002222 km/sec The time it takes for the faster train to pass the slower train is given as 36 seconds. During this time, the faster train covers the length of both trains. Distance covered in 36 seconds at the relative speed is: Distance = Relative speed × Time Distance = 0.002222 km/sec × 36 sec Distance = 0.079992 km Since the distance covered is the combined length of both trains and both trains are of equal length, we can say: 2L = 0.079992 km Now, we solve for L: L = 0.079992 km / 2 L = 0.039996 km To convert the length from kilometers to meters (since train lengths are usually measured in meters), we use the conversion factor: 1 km = 1000 meters L = 0.039996 km × 1000 meters/km L = 39.996 meters Since we are looking for a practical answer, we can round this to the nearest whole number: L ≈ 40 meters Therefore, the length of each train is approximately boxed{40} meters."},{"prompt":"Points A and B are taken on the graph of the function ( y = frac{1}{x} ), ( x > 0 ).

Hence, the remaining sticks are X, Y, and 50. - To form a triangle with sides a, b, c such that a leq b leq c, the triangle inequality must hold: a + b > c. In our case: [ a + 50 = b ] This does not satisfy the triangle inequality because it becomes a + 50 = a + (a + 50) Rightarrow 2a + 50 > a + 50, simplifying to a > 0, which holds, but a + 50 = b is insufficient to ensure a triangle. - **Case 2: Stick 50 is removed.** Here, eventually either two sticks will be significantly short (<50), and the other longer stick cannot form a valid triangle: - Let’s say the remaining sticks are a, b where a < b, but because of Béla's strategy, one stick is 50 - Y: [a = X, quad b = X + 50, quad c = 50 + Y] We need a + c > b or X + (50 - Y) > X + 50, which boils down to: [50 - Y > 50 Rightarrow -Y > 0] This inequality is not valid. 5. **Conclusion:** Béla's strategy ensures that whichever sticks remain, they won't form a triangle, losing Andrea the game.

We need to form three rectangles using these lengths. The possible configurations for the rectangles are: - Using all four pieces of the same type for each rectangle, forming squares. - Using different combinations of the lengths to form rectangles. 3. **Calculating the Area for Squares:** If we use all four pieces of the same type for each rectangle, we form squares with side lengths (a), (b), and (c). The areas of these squares are: [ text{Area of square with side } a = a^2 ] [ text{Area of square with side } b = b^2 ] [ text{Area of square with side } c = c^2 ] Therefore, the total area when using squares is: [ A_{text{total}} = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ] 4. **Calculating the Area for Rectangles:** If we use different combinations of the lengths to form rectangles, we need to consider all possible configurations.

The total area for these configurations is: [ A_{text{total}} = ab + bc + ca ] 5. **Comparing the Areas:** We need to show that the total area when using squares is always greater than or equal to the total area when using rectangles. This can be shown using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality), which states that for any non-negative real numbers (x) and (y): [ frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy} ] Applying this to our problem: [ frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} geq ab ] [ frac{b^2 + c^2}{2} geq bc ] [ frac{c^2 + a^2}{2} geq ca ] Adding these inequalities, we get: [ frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} + frac{b^2 + c^2}{2} + frac{c^2 + a^2}{2} geq ab + bc + ca ] Simplifying, we get: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 geq ab + bc + ca ] Therefore, the total area when using squares is always greater than or equal to the total area when using rectangles. 6. **When Does It Not Matter:** The equality holds when (a = b = c).

The key to solving this problem is to find the slope of the line x - sqrt{3}y + 6 = 0, which is the tangent value of the angle of inclination. **Step-by-step Solution** 1. Rearrange the equation of the line to the slope-intercept form y = mx + b, where m is the slope. The given equation is x - sqrt{3}y + 6 = 0. To isolate y, first subtract x + 6 from both sides: -sqrt{3}y = -x + 6. Next, divide both sides by -sqrt{3}: y = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}x - frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}. Thus, the slope of the line is m = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. 2. Find the angle of inclination theta using the tangent function. Since the slope m is equal to the tangent of the angle of inclination, we have: m = tan(theta) = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. The angle theta can be found by taking the arctangent of both sides: theta = arctanleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{3}right) = 30^circ. Therefore, the angle of inclination of the line x - sqrt{3}y + 6 = 0 is boxed{30^circ}."},{"prompt":"During a business lunch at a local Chinese restaurant, I discovered that I had dietary restrictions due to a new health condition.

Start with a convex quadrilateral that can be covered by a unit-radius circular disk. If one of its vertices is inside the circle, we can extend the sides of the quadrilateral such that the vertices are on the circumference of the circle without decreasing the length of any of its sides. Therefore, it suffices to prove the claim for cyclic quadrilaterals, i.e., quadrilaterals whose vertices lie on the circumference of the circle. 2. Denote the quadrilateral by (ABCD) with sides (a, b, c, d), and diagonals (e) and (f). Let (varphi) be the angle between the diagonals, and (beta=angle ABC) and (delta=angle CDA). 3. The area (T_{ABCD}) of the quadrilateral can be written as the sum of the areas of triangles (ABC) and (ACD): [ T_{ABCD} = T_{ABC} + T_{ACD} ] 4. Express the area using the diagonals and angles: [ frac{efsinvarphi}{2} = frac{absinbeta}{2} + frac{cdsindelta}{2} ] 5. Cyclic quadrilaterals have the property that their opposite angles are supplementary, thus (sinbeta = sindelta). Utilizing this property, and the fact that the circle's radius (R=1), we have: [ frac{efsinvarphi}{2} = left(ab + cdright)frac{sinbeta}{2} = left(ab + cdright)frac{e}{4R} ] 6. The area can also be expressed by dividing the quadrilateral using the other diagonal: [ T_{ABCD} = (bc + da) frac{f}{4R} ] 7. Equate the two expressions for the area and multiply them: [ T_{ABCD}^2 = left(frac{efsinvarphi}{2}right)^2 = (ab + cd)(bc + da) frac{ef}{16R^2} ] 8. Simplifying using the fact that (R = 1): [ frac{efsin^2varphi}{4} = (ab + cd)(bc + da) frac{1}{4} ] 9. Apply the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM inequality): [ frac{ef}{4} geq 2sqrt{abcd} frac{1}{4} = frac{sqrt{abcd}}{2} ] 10. Simplifying further yields: [ frac{efsin^2varphi}{4} geq frac{abcd}{4} ] 11. As (e) and (f) are the diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral that fit within the circle, the maximum values for (e) and (f) are as the diameters of the circle, (e, f leq 2). Additionally, since ( sinvarphi leq 1 ): 12. Therefore, we get: [ frac{abcd}{4} leq 1 implies abcd leq 4 ] 13. The equality holds if and only if both diagonals are the diameters of the circle, and the angle between them is (90^{circ}), meaning the quadrilateral is a square. # Conclusion: [ boxed{abcd leq 4} ] The statement has been proven for convex quadrilaterals covered by a unit-radius circular disk."},{"prompt":"A busy waiter had to manage 33 customers in his initial morning shift.

However, by the end of the evening, 40% of the customers had departed. How many customers does he have left to serve in the late evening?","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Initial morning shift: The waiter starts with 33 customers. 2. During the morning shift: 31 customers leave, so the number of customers remaining is 33 - 31 = 2. 3. After the morning shift: Another 26 customers come in, so the total number of customers is now 2 + 26 = 28. 4. Evening shift (25% increase from the initial morning count): The initial morning count was 33 customers. A 25% increase would be 33 * 0.25 = 8.25. Since we can't have a fraction of a customer, we'll round this to 8 customers (assuming we round down because you can't serve a partial customer). So, the number of customers in the evening shift is the morning count plus the increase, which is 33 + 8 = 41 customers. 5. By the end of the evening shift (40% departure): 40% of the customers leave, so we calculate 40% of 41, which is 41 * 0.40 = 16.4. Again, assuming we can't have a fraction of a customer, we'll consider 16 customers leaving (rounding down for the same reason as before).

Start by analyzing the inequality: [ 0 leqslant x^{4} - x^{3} + a x + b leqslant (x^2 - 1)^2 ] The right-hand side, ( (x^2 - 1)^2 ), can be expanded: [ (x^2 - 1)^2 = x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 ] Thus, the inequality can be rewritten as: [ 0 leqslant x^{4} - x^{3} + a x + b leqslant x^4 - 2x^2 + 1 ] 2.

However, in this case, since the weights are given in decimal form, we can multiply both sides by 10 to get rid of the decimal and then find the GCD of the resulting whole numbers: Ratio of zinc to copper = 333 kg : 407 kg Now we need to find the GCD of 333 and 407.

Each possible arrangement can be seen as creating a sequence of edges connecting these points, forming a closed polygon. 3. **Dynamic Coverage:** - Consider intervals between pairs of numbers s and s+1. Each interval can be covered by up to 2 text{ min}(s, 1962-s) such segments. - For instance, for s leq 981, the interval [s, s+1] can be covered by up to 2s segments, otherwise, it can be covered by up to 2(1962-s) segments. 4. **Construct Optimal Sequence:** - One way to maximize the distances sequentially is to alternatively pick the largest possible remaining number and the smallest possible remaining number, so at each step the distance maxes out. - This translates into taking the middle number 881 (roughly half of 1962), and adding the numbers alternatively greater and smaller: - Start with 881. - Next term is 882 (greater end), followed by 880 (lower end). - Continue this pattern: 883, 879, 884, 878, ..., until you exhaust all numbers. 5. **Formal Sequence Construction:** - Consequently, the sequence will look like: [ 881, 882, 880, 883, 879, 884, 878, ..., 1962, 1 ] - This ensures that large and small numbers appear next to each other, thus maximizing the difference at each step. # Conclusion: Thus, an optimal arrangement that maximizes the total sum of absolute differences in the sequence is: [ boxed{881, 882, 880, 883, 879, ldots, 1962} ]"},{"prompt":"triangle ABC, E is the midpoint of side BC and D is the midpoint of side AC.

We can place: - One black face adjacent to the white on any one of the four side faces. - Place the second black face on one of the remaining three sides adjacent to the white. - The third black face cannot be on the bottom (this would make it adjacent to all other faces, including another black), so it must be on the remaining side face not adjacent to the white. 3. **Placement of Yellow Faces**: The two remaining faces automatically become yellow, including the bottom face. Given the fixed white top, the placement of the first black face adjacent to the white can be done in 4 ways. For each of these, there are 2 choices for the second black face (on the remaining side faces that are adjacent to the white). The third black face and the two yellow faces have only one choice each based on the remaining available faces. Therefore, the number of distinct cubes is calculated by counting different positions for black faces, which is 4 times 2 = 8.

Since ( b_n = a_n + d ), we get: [ |b_n - d| = |a_n + d - d| = |a_n| = p ] Therefore, ( |b_n - d| ) is prime for all ( n ). 3. **Periodicity of the sequence modulo ( m ):** It is well-known that for any positive integer ( m ), the sequence of pairs ( (b_i, b_{i+1}) pmod{m} ) is periodic.

Then, for all ( n ), ( |b_n - d| = p ). This implies: [ b_n - d in { p, -p } ] 5. **Infinitely many ( n ) with ( b_n - d in { p, -p } ):** Since ( b_n ) is periodic modulo ( m ), there are infinitely many ( n ) such that ( b_n equiv b_1 pmod{p} ).

The total distance traveled by both cars is 1000 km, so we can write the equation: [ 6 times v_A + 2 times v_B = 1000 ] We know that ( v_B = 50 ) km/h, so we can substitute that into the equation: [ 6 times v_A + 2 times 50 = 1000 ] [ 6 times v_A + 100 = 1000 ] [ 6 times v_A = 1000 - 100 ] [ 6 times v_A = 900 ] [ v_A = frac{900}{6} ] [ v_A = 150 ] km/h Now we can find the ratio of the speed of Car A to the speed of Car B: [ frac{v_A}{v_B} = frac{150}{50} ] [ frac{v_A}{v_B} = 3 ] So the ratio of the speed of Car A to the speed of Car B is boxed{3:1} ."},{"prompt":"John bought a tennis racket, sneakers, and a sports outfit.

John received a 20% discount on the tennis racket, so he paid ( P - 0.20P = 0.80P ) for the tennis racket. The total cost of the sneakers and sports outfit before tax is ( 200 + 250 = 450 ). So, the cost of the tennis racket after the discount plus the cost of the other items before tax is ( 0.80P + 450 ). There is also a 10% sales tax on the entire order, so the total cost including tax is ( 1.10 times (0.80P + 450) ). We know that the total amount John spent is 750, so we can set up the equation: ( 1.10 times (0.80P + 450) = 750 ) Now, let's solve for ( P ): ( 0.88P + 495 = 750 ) Subtract 495 from both sides: ( 0.88P = 750 - 495 ) ( 0.88P = 255 ) Now, divide both sides by 0.88 to find ( P ): ( P = frac{255}{0.88} ) ( P = 289.77 ) (rounded to two decimal places) So, the original price of the tennis racket before the discount was approximately boxed{289.77} ."},{"prompt":"Find all solutions to the equation sqrt[3]{5 x} = frac{5}{2}.","completion":"To solve for x, first cube both sides to get rid of the cube root: [ left(sqrt[3]{5 - x}right)^3 = left(-frac{5}{2}right)^3 ] Which simplifies to: [ 5 - x = -frac{125}{8} ] Solving for x by isolating it on one side, we get: [ -x = -frac{125}{8} - 5 = -frac{125}{8} - frac{40}{8} = -frac{165}{8} ] [ x = frac{165}{8} ] Thus, the solution to the equation is: [ boxed{frac{165}{8}} ]"},{"prompt":"A student plans to use the method of contradiction to prove the following problem: The function f(x) is defined on the interval [0,1] and f(0)=f(1).

First, we need to find the slope of the line. We know that the line passes through the points (-8, y) and (10, 3), and it has an x-intercept of 4. This means that the line also passes through the point (4, 0). The slope of the line (m) can be calculated using the two points (10, 3) and (4, 0): m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) m = (3 - 0) / (10 - 4) m = 3 / 6 m = 1/2 Now that we have the slope, we can use the point (4, 0) to find the y-intercept (b). We plug the values into the slope-intercept form: 0 = (1/2)(4) + b 0 = 2 + b b = -2 So the equation of the line is y = (1/2)x - 2. Now we can find the y-coordinate of the point with an x-coordinate of -8 by plugging it into the equation: y = (1/2)(-8) - 2 y = -4 - 2 y = -6 Therefore, the y-coordinate of the point with an x-coordinate of -8 is boxed{-6} ."},{"prompt":"Megan had 217 markers.

Here, ( P(n) ) states that we can distribute the amount of water in such a way that no seau (bucket) contains more than 1 liter of water. Initial step (Base case): For ( n = 1 ), we have one bottle and one seau. Since the quantity of water in the bottle is less than 1 liter, we can simply empty the bottle into the one seau. This clearly respects the condition since the seau will contain less than 1 liter of water. Inductive Step: Assume that the property ( P(n) ) is true for some ( n geq 1 ), i.e., if the total amount of water is ( frac{n}{2} ) liters, we can distribute this amount into ( n ) seaux such that no seau contains more than 1 liter of water. We need to show that ( P(n+1) ) is true, meaning we need to distribute ( frac{n+1}{2} ) liters of water into ( n+1 ) seaux such that no seau contains more than 1 liter of water. 1. **Case 1:** There exists a bottle that contains at least ( frac{1}{2} ) liter of water. - We can empty this bottle into one seau. This seau will then contain at most 1 liter of water since no bottle contains more than 1 liter of water. - The remaining amount of water is ( frac{n+1}{2} - text{(amount in this bottle)} leq frac{n}{2} ). - By the induction hypothesis ( P(n) ), the remaining water (which is at most ( frac{n}{2} ) liters) can be distributed into the remaining ( n ) seaux such that no seau contains more than 1 liter of water. 2. **Case 2:** All bottles contain less than ( frac{1}{2} ) liter of water. - We start emptying these bottles one by one into the first seau until the cumulative amount of water exceeds ( frac{1}{2} ) liter. - Let ( a < frac{1}{2} ) liter be the amount of water in the seau just before emptying the last needed bottle. - Adding the last bottle, the seau will have ( a + b ) liters, where ( b < frac{1}{2} ). Thus, ( a + b < 1 ) liter since ( a + b leq 1 ). - Now, this first seau contains less than 1 liter of water. - The remaining water is ( frac{n+1}{2} - (a + b) leq frac{n}{2} ). - By the induction hypothesis ( P(n) ), the remaining water can be distributed among the remaining ( n ) seaux such that no seau contains more than 1 liter of water. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, ( P(n+1) ) is true if ( P(n) ) is true. Since the base case (( n = 1 )) is satisfied, by induction, the property ( P(n) ) holds for all ( n geq 1 ).

Such a vertex will be a disconnected, isolated vertex. - If the two numbers on a card are (i) and (j) with (i neq j), an edge ( (i, j) ) is added between vertices (i) and (j). If there are two such cards, there will be a double edge between (i) and (j). 3. **Graph Properties:** - The graph consists of (n) vertices and (n) edges. - Each number appears exactly twice on the cards, hence each vertex has degree 2. 4. **Consider Cycles:** - By the degree sequence, the graph is a disjoint union of cycles and isolated vertices (those with self-loops only). Each component of the graph will either be a cycle of length at least 2 or an isolated vertex. 5. **Detailed Examination of Cycles:** - Remove isolated vertices and double edges: - Isolated vertices formed by self-looped cards correspond directly to individual cycles of length 1. - Each double edge is treated as part of a larger cycle (effectively forming a cycle of length 2). 6. **Cycle Formation and Unions:** - After removal, the remaining vertices still form cycles. - Each number (1, 2, ldots, n) appears exactly twice in the graph’s edges, ensuring there is no vertex with degree other than 2. 7. **Completing the Argument:** - By structuring the cards to create visible cycles, we can place each card such that every face visible contributes to a complete set ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ). - The graph of each cycle will thus show all necessary numbers once on their visible faces. 8. **Cycle Verification:** - Each cycle is formed exactly without overlap, ensuring that no repetition occurs beyond the provided ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ). **Conclusion:** Thus, each card can be arranged on the table such that the upward facing side displays all natural numbers (1, 2, ldots, n) exactly once. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"The ratio of two numbers is 3 : 4 and their sum is 21.

We need to find all ( n in mathbb{N} ) such that ( n + m(n) ) is a power of 10, i.e., ( n + m(n) = 10^k ) for some ( k in mathbb{N} ). 2. Note that ( n geq 2 ) because the smallest natural number ( n ) is 1, and its greatest proper divisor is 0, which does not satisfy the condition ( n + m(n) = 10^k ). 3. Consider the case where ( n ) is even. If ( n ) is even, then ( m(n) = frac{n}{2} ). Substituting this into the equation, we get: [ n + frac{n}{2} = 10^k implies frac{3n}{2} = 10^k implies 3n = 2 cdot 10^k ] Since ( 2 cdot 10^k ) is even, ( 3n ) must be even, which implies ( n ) must be even. However, ( 3n = 2 cdot 10^k ) implies ( n = frac{2 cdot 10^k}{3} ), which is not an integer unless ( 10^k ) is divisible by 3. This is a contradiction because ( 10^k ) is never divisible by 3. Therefore, ( n ) cannot be even. 4. Now consider the case where ( n ) is odd. Let ( n = l cdot m(n) ) where ( l in mathbb{N} ) and ( l geq 2 ). Then we have: [ n + m(n) = l cdot m(n) + m(n) = (l + 1) cdot m(n) = 10^k ] Since ( n ) is odd, ( m(n) ) must also be odd. Therefore, we can write ( m(n) = 5^x ) and ( l + 1 = 2^a cdot 5^b ) where ( x, a, b in mathbb{N} ) and ( x + a + b = k ). 5. If ( l > 5 ), then ( m(n) ) would not be the greatest proper divisor of ( n ). Therefore, ( l leq 5 ). This implies ( 2^a cdot 5^b leq 6 ). The only possible values for ( a ) and ( b ) that satisfy this inequality are ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 0 ), which gives ( l + 1 = 2 ), or ( a = 0 ) and ( b = 1 ), which gives ( l + 1 = 5 ). 6. For ( l + 1 = 2 ), we have ( l = 1 ), which is a contradiction because ( l geq 2 ). 7. For ( l + 1 = 5 ), we have ( l = 4 ). Substituting ( l = 4 ) into the equation, we get: [ (4 + 1) cdot m(n) = 10^k implies 5 cdot m(n) = 10^k ] This implies ( m(n) = 2 cdot 10^{k-1} ). Since ( m(n) ) must be odd, the only possible value for ( k ) is 2. Therefore, ( m(n) = 2 cdot 10^{2-1} = 20 ), which is not odd. This is a contradiction. 8. Therefore, the only possible value for ( k ) is 2, and we have: [ (3 + 1) cdot m(n) = 10^2 implies 4 cdot m(n) = 100 implies m(n) = 25 ] Since ( m(n) = 25 ), we have ( n = 3 cdot 25 = 75 ).

The idea is to sequentially mark the natural numbers with colors corresponding to the subsets A_i. 3. **Initial Marking:** Suppose we have already marked some segment of the natural numbers [1, N] with A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k, such that N, N-1, ldots, N-k+1 are marked respectively with A_k, A_{k-1}, ldots, A_1.

Let N + N_1 be the last number colored with A_{k+1} when this condition is satisfied. 5. **Choosing the Distance m:** Choose m such that m > max(N_1, k+1).

There are different ways to do this, but we'll follow a specific method for clarity. Let the side length of the original square be ( a ). We'll make the first cut from one corner to the midpoint of the opposite side, and then make another two cuts from the midpoint of adjacent sides to form three smaller squares and one additional piece. Consider the following cuts: - Make a diagonal cut from ((0, 0)) to ((a, a)). - Make a vertical cut from ((frac{a}{2}, a)) to ((frac{a}{2}, 0)). - Make a horizontal cut from ((a, frac{a}{2})) to ((0, frac{a}{2})). This results in four pieces: - **Piece 1:** A triangle with area ( frac{a^2}{2} ), from the diagonal cut. - **Piece 2:** Two smaller squares of side length ( frac{a}{2} ), with total area ( frac{a^2}{2} ). - **Piece 3:** An additional small piece which will be arranged to form the remaining portion of squares. 2. **Reassemble to Form Three Squares:** - We aim to form three squares using the four parts from the partition step. - **Square 1:** Use the half-squares created from the diagonal cut. This forms one complete square of side ( frac{a}{2} ) and area ( frac{a^2}{4} ). - **Square 2:** Rearrange the two smaller squares of side ( frac{a}{2} ) from Piece 2. - **Square 3:** Combine the smaller pieces obtained from the horizontal and vertical cuts to complete the third square of similar size. When arranged properly, these pieces will fit together to make three smaller squares of equal sides. 3. **Conclusion:** - Upon rearranging the 4 parts obtained from the original square, we have successfully formed three squares.

We need to find the sum: [ sum_{k=1}^{1980} frac{1}{a_k} ] 1. **Understanding the Sequence ( a_n ):** Each integer ( k=1, 2, 3, ldots ) appears in the sequence ( (a_n) ) exactly ( 2k ) times. This is because the condition ( a_n = k ) is equivalent to: [ k - frac{1}{2} < sqrt{n} < k + frac{1}{2} ] Squaring the inequalities, we get: [ (k - frac{1}{2})^2 < n < (k + frac{1}{2})^2 ] Expanding these, we have: [ k^2 - k + frac{1}{4} < n < k^2 + k + frac{1}{4} ] Since ( n ) is an integer, the number ( n ) must lie in the interval: [ k^2 - k < n leq k^2 + k ] The length of this interval is ( (k^2 + k) - (k^2 - k) = 2k ). 2. **Group the terms:** We consider the sum in groups. Each integer ( k ) appears ( 2k ) times in the series, so the contribution of each group can be summed accordingly: [ frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{1} quad (text{2 times for } k=1) ] [ frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} quad (text{4 times for } k=2) ] [ frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{3} quad (text{6 times for } k=3) ] Hence, for each ( k ), each term for ( frac{1}{a_n} ) when ( a_n = k ) sums to ( 2k cdot frac{1}{k} = 2 ). 3. **Sum up to the required value:** We continue summing for each possible ( k ).

After selecting a president, there are (n - 1) choices left for vice president, because the president cannot also be the vice president. The number of ways to select a president and vice president is the product of the number of choices for each position.

Task: Construct point ( B' ), symmetric to an arbitrary point ( B ) with respect to the axis ( l ) using only a ruler. 3. Steps of Construction: a. **Identify Intersection Points**: - Draw a line ( BA ) and let it intersect ( l ) at point ( M ). - Similarly, draw a line ( BA' ) and let it intersect ( l ) at point ( N ). Mathematically, we denote: [ (BA) cap l = M ] [ (BA') cap l = N ] b. **Draw Symmetric Lines**: - The lines ( MA ) and ( MA' ), as well as ( AN ) and ( A'N ), are symmetric relative to ( l ).

Let's denote: ( x ) as the number of exchanges from two to three, ( y ) as the number of exchanges from three to two. 2. **Formulate the Equation for the Number of Coupons**: Each exchange from two to three increases the number of coupons by 1 (since 3 - 2 = 1). Each exchange from three to two decreases the number of coupons by 1 (since 2 - 3 = -1). Let's set up the equations based on these exchanges. Since we start with 100 coupons and end with 100 coupons, the net change in the number of coupons is zero. Hence: [ text{(Number of coupons gained from } x text{ exchanges)} - text{(Number of coupons lost from } y text{ exchanges)} = 0 ] This translates to: [ x - y = 0 ] or [ x = y ] 3. **Total Number of Exchanges**: We know that the total number of exchanges must add up to 1991: [ x + y = 1991 ] 4. **Solving the Equations Simultaneously**: From (x = y): [ x + x = 1991 ] [ 2x = 1991 ] [ x = frac{1991}{2} ] [ x = 995.5 ] 5. **Conclusion**: The number ( 995.5 ) is not an integer, meaning it is not possible to perform an integer number of exchanges of the required types to sum exactly 1991 exchanges of type x and y.

Let ( S O ) be their intersection line. 3. **Angle in Axial Sections:** - Let ( varphi ) be the angle in the axial section of each cone. Since the generatrices become the axes in the other cone, ( S A_2 ) acts as a generatrix for the cone with axis ( S A_1 ), and ( varphi ) becomes ( 90^circ ). - Thus, ( varphi = 90^circ ). 4. **Details of Right Triangles:** - Consider the right triangles formed in the sections of the cones: [ angle A_2 S O = angle O S A_1 = frac{varphi}{4} = 22.5^circ ] - The angles at the bases: [ angle A_2 S B = angle A_2 S C = angle A_1 S B = angle A_1 S C = frac{varphi}{2} = 45^circ ] - The angles within the perpendicular planes involving the common generatrices: [ angle O S B = angle O S C = frac{alpha}{2} ] 5. **Geometric Relationships and Trigonometry:** - Using trigonometric relationships, place these points on a coordinate system assuming the points ( A_1, A_2, B, C, ) and ( O ) lie in a plane perpendicular to ( SO ) and at a distance ( h ) from ( S ): [ S A_1 = frac{h}{cos(22.5^circ)}, quad S C = frac{h}{cos(frac{alpha}{2})} ] - Define: [ O A_1 = h tan(22.5^circ), quad O C = h tan(frac{alpha}{2}) ] 6. **Applying the Pythagorean theorem in different triangles:** - In triangle ( triangle O A_1 C ): [ A_1 C^2 = h^2 tan^2(22.5^circ) + h^2 tan^2(frac{alpha}{2}) ] - In triangle ( triangle S A_1 C ): [ A_1 C^2 = frac{h^2}{cos^2(22.5^circ)} + frac{h^2}{cos^2(frac{alpha}{2})} - 2 frac{h^2}{cos(22.5^circ) cos(frac{alpha}{2})} cos(45^circ) ] 7. **Solving for ( cos(frac{alpha}{2}) ):** - With ( varphi = 90^circ ): [ cosleft(frac{alpha}{2}right) = sqrt{frac{2}{2 + sqrt{2}}} ] 8. **Calculating ( alpha ):** - By doubling the angle: [ alpha = 2 cos^{-1}left(sqrt{frac{2}{2 + sqrt{2}}}right) ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{2 arccos sqrt{frac{2}{2 + sqrt{2}}}} ]"},{"prompt":"Let w, x, y, and z be whole numbers.

Thus, without loss of generality, let CD = x. - In this scenario, the angle DCA equals the angle DCB, which gives: [ angle DCA = angle DCB = frac{360^circ - 60^circ}{2} = 150^circ. ] - Here, AC = CD = x, forming an isosceles triangle ACD with 150^circ at C. - Applying the Law of Cosines in triangle ACD: [ AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 - 2 cdot AC cdot CD cdot cos 150^circ ] [ AD^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2 cdot x cdot x cdot left(-frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right) ] [ AD^2 = 2x^2 + x^2 sqrt{3} ] [ a^2 = 2b^2 + b^2 sqrt{3}, quad frac{a^2}{b^2} = 2 + sqrt{3} ] [ frac{a}{b} = sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}} ] 2. **Case 2: Fourth Point is a Reflection** - If DA = DB = x, D could also be the reflection of C across line AB. - Then CD is y. Since CD is the median of the equilateral triangle, it also serves as a perpendicular bisector, and thus CD perp AB. - By symmetry, triangle DAB forms, and x and y are sides of an isosceles triangle with: [ text{Angle between sides} = 120^circ ] - Applying the Law of Cosines: [ DA^2 = y^2 + y^2 - 2 cdot y cdot y cdot cos 120^circ = 2y^2 + y^2 cdot cos 60^circ ] [ x = sqrt{3} y ] [ frac{a}{b} = sqrt{3} ] 3. **Case 3: No Regular Triangle** Assuming no configuration where points form an equilateral triangle, we can infer another scenario where one triangle is isosceles and includes the fourth point. - Consider an isosceles triangle such that DA = DB, and D lies on the perpendicular bisector not forming any x length directly. - This could imply configurations where AB = y and the remaining DA = DB = DC = x. This is another valid configuration involving a square. - Through analysis, this would yield: [ y^2 = x^2 + x^2 ] leading to: [ frac{a}{b} = sqrt{2} ] 4. **Case 4: Golden Section with Ratios** Let's analyze the scenario involving symmetry and identical lengths at angles relevant to the golden ratio. - Suppose the split involves alpha = BDA = BAC, which matches with A = B = y and x=y till reflecting across symmetrical splits. - Assuming similar symmetry, this configuration involves associating: [ phi = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} ] [ frac{a}{b} = phi ] **Conclusion:** Thus the possible values of frac{a}{b} where there are exactly two different distance values between four points on a plane are as follows: [ boxed{sqrt{2}, frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}, sqrt{3}, sqrt{2 + sqrt{3}}} ]"},{"prompt":"The hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle is 6sqrt{2} units.

Specifically, we note: - A red card should not be played immediately before a blue card, as it increases the score by 3. - A white card should not be played immediately before a red card, as it increases the score by 2. - A blue card should not be played immediately before a white card, as it increases the score by 1. 3. **Sequence Analysis**: The optimal sequence must be of the form: - BRW (Blue, Red, White): This sequence minimizes score based on synergy between the cards. - RWB (Red, White, Blue) - WBR (White, Blue, Red) Let’s compute the scores for these sequences: - **BRW**: The score is [AC], where A is the number of blue cards and C is the number of white cards. - **RWB**: The score is [3AB], where B is the number of red cards. - **WBR**: The score is [2BC]. 4. **Identify the Minimum Score**: To determine the lowest possible score, we need to compute the minimum of the above expressions: [ text{Minimum score} = min(AC, 3AB, 2BC) ] 5. **Counting Valid Ways**: Next, to determine how many ways this minimum score can be achieved, we consider the conditions where the equalities hold uniquely or in combinations: - If (max(B, A/2, C/3)) is unique, then there is only one valid way to achieve the minimum score. - If [B = A/2 ] and [B > C/3], there are ((C+1)) ways. - If [B = C/3] and [B > A/2], there are ((A+1)) ways. - If [A/2 = C/3] and [A/2 > B], there are ((B+1)) ways. - If [B = A/2 = C/3], then each sequence form can be played in many permutations, leading to [(A + B + C)] total ways. # Conclusion: Thus, reviewing the above computations, we conclude: [ boxed{min(AC, 3AB, 2BC)} ] The number of ways to achieve this minimum score depends on if and where the equalities hold within the comparisons of (B), (A/2), and (C/3). - If (max(B, A/2, C/3)) is unique, there is only one way. - If specific equalities are present, the number of ways varies accordingly as described."},{"prompt":"When a certain tree was first planted, it was some height, and the height of the tree increased by a constant amount each year for the next 6 years.

Since the tree grows by a constant amount each year, and we know that it grows by 0.5 feet each year, we can calculate the height of the tree at the end of each year. At the end of the 1st year, the tree's height would be ( H + 0.5 ) feet. At the end of the 2nd year, the tree's height would be ( H + 2 times 0.5 = H + 1 ) feet. At the end of the 3rd year, the tree's height would be ( H + 3 times 0.5 = H + 1.5 ) feet. At the end of the 4th year, the tree's height would be ( H + 4 times 0.5 = H + 2 ) feet. At the end of the 5th year, the tree's height would be ( H + 5 times 0.5 = H + 2.5 ) feet. At the end of the 6th year, the tree's height would be ( H + 6 times 0.5 = H + 3 ) feet. According to the problem, at the end of the 6th year, the tree was 1/6 taller than it was at the end of the 4th year. This means that the height of the tree at the end of the 6th year is equal to the height at the end of the 4th year plus an additional 1/6 of the height at the end of the 4th year.

Prove that the city may be partitioned into 1014 districts such that streets join only markets from different districts, and by the same oneway for any two districts (either only from first to second, or viceversa).","completion":"1. **Lemma 1:** If there exists exactly one street leaving every market, then the city can be partitioned into five districts. *Proof:* - Assume that ignoring the orientation of the streets, the city is connected. If not, work with each connected component separately. - There must exist a cycle: start with any market and keep moving via the unique street leaving each market. By finiteness, eventually, we return to a previously visited market, forming a cycle. - Let street ( XY ) be part of a cycle (so it leads from ( X ) to ( Y )). Remove it. The city (without the orientation) remains connected because ( X ) and ( Y ) are still joined via the rest of the cycle. - If there are ( n ) markets, then there is one street leaving each market except ( X ), yielding ( n-1 ) edges in the undirected corresponding graph. This means it's a tree, and in particular, there are no more cycles. - From every market ( Z ), there is a unique path starting from ( Z ) because there is a unique street leaving each market. This path is finite because there are no cycles, i.e., it will eventually hit ( X ) and stop. - Consider the following three districts: district 0 consisting of ( Z ) for which the above path has length divisible by 3, district 1 consisting of ( Z ) for which the path has length 1 modulo 3, and district 2 consisting of ( Z ) for which the length of the path is 2 modulo 3. - Clearly, the edges run from district 2 to 1, 1 to 0, and 0 to 2. It follows that this partition satisfies our condition for the city with street ( XY ) removed. - Now add ( XY ) back in. It may disrupt the partition, so create a fourth district and place ( X ) there (originally ( X ) was in district 0). This is not enough yet: if ( SY ) is a street (so ( S ) is in district 1) and ( Y ) is also in district 1, then the streets between districts 1 and 4 run both ways. Correct it by placing ( Y ) in a newly created fifth district. - The lemma is proved. 2. **Lemma 2:** If there exists one street leaving every market, then one can partition the city into (at most) three districts such that no two markets from the same district are connected. *Proof:* - Assume the undirected graph is connected and then remove an edge ( XY ) as above. - Partition the city into two districts by the parity of the length of the corresponding path. - Adding ( XY ) back may create a street between two markets in district 0; if that's the case, move ( X ) into a new third district. 3. **Main Proof:** - For every market, color the two streets leaving it red and blue. - This creates two cities: the red city and the blue city, with the same markets but half the streets. Both satisfy the conditions of Lemma 1, thus we can divide the markets into (at most) five blue districts and five red districts that satisfy the requirements with respect to blue and red streets. - Consider also a third orange city. An orange \\"street\\" ( A to B ) consists of a blue street ( A to C ) and a red street ( C to B ); there is exactly one orange street leaving every market. By Lemma 2, we can partition the markets into three orange districts such that no two markets from the same district are connected with an orange \\"street\\". - Classify the markets according to the following criteria: - The blue district to which ( X ) belongs. - The red district to which ( X ) belongs. - The orange district to which ( X ) belongs. - There is a unique red street leaving ( X ) and entering another market ( Y ). Consider the orange district to which ( Y ) belongs. - This description partitions the markets into (at most) ( 5 cdot 5 cdot 3 cdot 3 = 225 ) districts. We prove they satisfy the requirements. - No two markets from the same district can be connected by a street, because a blue street changes the blue district and a red street changes the red district. Similarly, the red streets between two districts all point the same way, and the blue streets between two districts all point the same way. - The last case to exclude is when a red street and a blue street join two districts in opposite directions. - Suppose we have a blue street from ( A ) to ( B ), and a red street from ( C ) to ( D ) where ( A ) and ( D ) (not necessarily distinct) belong to the same district and ( B ) and ( C ) also belong to the same district. - Let ( BE ) be the red street leaving ( B ). Because ( B ) and ( C ) belong to the same district, it follows that ( D ) and ( E ) belong to the same orange district (fourth criterion). But ( D ) and ( A ) belong to the same orange district (third criterion), so ( A ) and ( E ) belong to the same orange district. Further, ( A to B to E ) is an orange street connecting ( A ) and ( E ). But this contradicts Lemma 2.

Assume ( Z Y < Z X ). 2. If points ( Y ) and ( Z ) lie on opposite sides of ( l ), then by contrapositive, points ( Z ) and ( X ) must lie on the same side of ( l ). 3. However, under this scenario, ( Z Y > Z X ) which contradicts our initial assumption. 4. **Conclusion of Lemma**: - The lemma is successfully demonstrated. 5. **Application to the Given Problem**: 1. Given points ( A ) and ( B ) lying in the same half-plane with boundary ( l ), which contains point ( C ). 2. Let ( l ) be the perpendicular bisector of segment ( CD ). 3. According to the proven lemma, both points ( A ) and ( B ) are in the half-plane containing ( C ). 4. Therefore, any point ( M ) lying on segment ( AB ) must also lie in this half-plane. 6. **Conclusion**: Any point ( M ) on the segment ( AB ) satisfies ( MC < MD ).

First, we observe that sqrt{10} lies between two consecutive integers.

Thus, we have: [x = 3] The decimal part y of sqrt{10} is the difference between sqrt{10} and its integer part x. Therefore, we have: [y = sqrt{10} - 3] Now, we are asked to find the value of y(x+sqrt{10}). Substituting the values of x and y into this expression, we get: begin{align*} y(x+sqrt{10}) &= (sqrt{10}-3)(3+sqrt{10}) &= (sqrt{10}-3)cdot(3+sqrt{10}) &= sqrt{10}cdotsqrt{10} + 3cdotsqrt{10} - 3cdotsqrt{10} - 3cdot3 &= 10 + 0 - 9 &= 10 - 9 &= 1 end{align*} Therefore, the value of y(x+sqrt{10}) is boxed{1}, which corresponds to choice boxed{A}."},{"prompt":"w many integers M less than 2000 can be written as the sum of k consecutive positive even integers from exactly 3 values of kge 1?","completion":"Let the first even integer be 2m, mgeq 1.
