The matrix A is: A = | 3 6 9 | | 6 13 20 | | 9 20 37 | The matrix A is symmetric, so we can proceed with the Cholesky decomposition. Now, we need to find the lower triangular matrix L such that A = L * L^T.

If the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular, and the system may have no unique solution. The determinant of A can be calculated using the following formula for a 3x3 matrix: det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) where a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i are the elements of the matrix A: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6 d = 3, e = 6, f = 9 g = 4, h = 8, i = 12 det(A) = 2(6 * 12 - 9 * 8) - 4(3 * 12 - 9 * 4) + 6(3 * 8 - 6 * 4) det(A) = 2(72 - 72) - 4(36 - 36) + 6(24 - 24) det(A) = 0 Since the determinant of A is zero, the matrix A is singular, and the system of linear equations does not have a unique solution. It could have either no solution or infinitely many solutions. To determine if the system has no solution or infinitely many solutions, we can check if the augmented matrix [A | B] has any inconsistent rows (rows of the form [0 0 0 | k], where k ≠ 0). If there are any inconsistent rows, the system has no solution; otherwise, it has infinitely many solutions. The augmented matrix [A | B] is: begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 6 & | & 10 3 & 6 & 9 & | & 15 4 & 8 & 12 & | & 20 end{bmatrix} We can perform row operations to put the augmented matrix in row-echelon form: 1. Subtract 1.5 times the first row from the second row: begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 6 & | & 10 0 & 0 & 0 & | & 0 4 & 8 & 12 & | & 20 end{bmatrix} 2. Subtract 2 times the first row from the third row: begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 6 & | & 10 0 & 0 & 0 & | & 0 0 & 0 & 0 & | & 0 end{bmatrix} Since there are no inconsistent rows in the row-echelon form of the augmented matrix, the system of linear equations has infinitely many solutions.
