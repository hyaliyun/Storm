We start with the square (ABCD) and note that point (E) lies on the segment ([BD]) such that (EB = AB). Given that (ABCD) is a square, this implies (EB = AB = BC), making (E) the midpoint of (BD). 2. Since (ABCD) is a square, each of its internal angles is (90^circ). 3. We observe that (EB = AB). Therefore, triangles (ABE) and (CEB) are both isosceles triangles with (AB = BE = EB) and (CB = BE), respectively. This occurs because (BE) is half of the diagonal of the square due to point (E) being the midpoint. 4. In triangle (ABE): - We know that (angle ABE = 45^circ), since the angles in the square meet at (90^circ) and the triangle (ABE) being isosceles divides it evenly. - Given that the sum of angles in any triangle adds up to (180^circ), we calculate the remaining angles: [ angle ABE + 2 cdot angle AEB = 180^circ ] [ 45^circ + 2 cdot angle AEB = 180^circ ] [ 2 cdot angle AEB = 135^circ ] [ angle AEB = frac{135^circ}{2} = 67.5^circ ] 5.

We need to investigate the properties of the triangle (ABC) regarding these conditions. 1. **Examining Equal Areas:** - If point (P) is such that triangles (PAB) and (PBC) have equal areas, (P) must lie on a specific set of points (T_B). The common property these triangles share is having (PB) as a common side. Hence, (P) should be positioned such that the perpendicular distances from (A) and (C) to the line (PB) are equal. - If point (P) coincides with vertex (B), both triangles (PAB) and (PBC) degenerate into line segments with zero area, thus (B in T_B). - For (P notequiv B), (P) lies either on the perpendicular bisector of (AC) if the line (PB) does not separate (A) and (C), or on the line through the midpoint of (AC) if (PB) separates them. 2. **Investigating Equal Perimeters:** - Next, let's focus on any point (P) from the derived set (T_B) and examine the condition for equal perimeters of the triangles.

If the pilot fish increased its speed by 50%, it means that if it was initially swimming at the same speed as Keanu (20 mph), it would now be swimming at 30 mph (20 mph + 50% of 20 mph). However, since the wind is also aiding their movement at 5 mph, we need to subtract this from the relative speed to get the speed of the pilot fish relative to the ocean. So, the pilot fish's speed relative to the ocean would be 30 mph - 5 mph = 25 mph. However, we must note that this calculation assumes the pilot fish was initially swimming at the same speed as Keanu, which may not be the case. Without the initial speeds of the shark and the pilot fish, we cannot determine the exact speed of the pilot fish relative to the ocean. The answer of boxed{25} mph is based on the assumption that the pilot fish was initially swimming at the same speed as Keanu."},{"prompt":"f sec y + tan y = 3, then find sec y tan y.","completion":"We use the identity (sec y + tan y)(sec y - tan y) = sec^2 y - tan^2 y = 1 again for this problem.

Let's break down the solution step by step adhering to the given conditions: 1. **Calculate the average price p:** Let the amount of money spent on each purchase be s. Therefore, the quantity purchased in the first transaction is frac{s}{a}, and in the second transaction, it is frac{s}{b}. The total quantity purchased is frac{s}{a} + frac{s}{b}, and the total amount spent is 2s. Thus, the average price p can be calculated as the total amount spent divided by the total quantity purchased: [p = frac{2s}{frac{s}{a} + frac{s}{b}} = frac{2s}{frac{s(b + a)}{ab}} = frac{2ab}{a + b}] Therefore, p = frac{2ab}{a + b}, which makes option A incorrect and confirms option B as correct. So, we can immediately conclude p = boxed{frac{2ab}{a+b}} for option B. 2. **Comparison of p with a:** Given that 0 < a < b, let's compare p with a: [p = frac{2ab}{a+b} > frac{2ab}{b + b} = frac{2ab}{2b} = a] This shows that p > a. 3. **Comparison of p with sqrt{ab}:** Using the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any two positive numbers, their arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to their geometric mean, we get: [a + b > 2sqrt{ab}] [a + b > 2sqrt{ab} Rightarrow frac{2ab}{a + b} < frac{2ab}{2sqrt{ab}} = sqrt{ab}] Therefore, p < sqrt{ab}. Combining this with the previous result (p > a), we get a < p < sqrt{ab}. This confirms option C as correct and option D as incorrect.

Hence, the initial number of strings in the net can be calculated by counting: - **Vertical strings**: There are (101) columns and (10) rows. Thus, [ 101 times 10 = 1010 ] - **Horizontal strings**: There are (10 + 1 = 11) rows and (100) columns. Thus, [ 11 times 100 = 1100 ] The total number of strings: [ 1010 + 1100 = 2110 ] 4. **Systematic Reduction**: Suppose we cut enough strings such that the net remains as a single piece. We shall count the number of strings that can still bind the net as one piece but cannot cut any more without breaking it into separate pieces. 5. **Graph Representation**: We can view this net as a graph where nodes represent intersections and edges represent strings. For a connected graph of (V) vertices, the maximum number of edges before it becomes disconnected is: [ V - 1 ] Here, (V = 1111). Thus, the maximum number of remaining strings in the connected net would be: [ 1111 - 1 = 1110 ] 6. **Calculating the Cut Strings**: We have calculated that there are (1110) removable strings out of the total (2110) strings. Thus, the number of strings that can be cut while ensuring the net remains a single piece is: [ 2110 - 1110 = 1000 ] 7. **Conclusion**: The maximum number of strings that can be cut in a (10 times 100) cell volleyball net without it falling into separate pieces is: [ boxed{1000} ]"},{"prompt":"w many different sets of three points in this equilateral triangular grid are the vertices of an equilateral triangle?

This construction is crucial as it helps in defining the cyclic nature of the quadrilaterals formed. 3. **Prove quadrilaterals are cyclic**: - For quadrilateral RY'PB, we have angle BRY' = 180^circ - theta and angle BPY' = theta.

Now, points (F), (M), (N), and (P) form the vertices of a parallelogram since they are the midpoints of the sides of the quadrilateral (ABCD). 3. **Property of Parallelogram:** In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other.

Let the point where the tangent from P touches ω1 be denoted as T_a, and similarly, let the point where the tangent from P touches ω2 be denoted as T_b. 4. From the properties of tangents, it follows that ( angle APT_a = angle PCA ). Let's denote ( angle PCA = varphi ). 5. Similarly, ( angle BPT_b = angle PCB ). 6. Note that ( angle PCB ) can be expressed as ( angle PCB = angle ACB - angle PCA = gamma - varphi ), where ( angle ACB = gamma ). 7. Using the angles we have found, the angle between the tangents ( T_aP ) and ( PT_b ) at point P is given by: [ angle T_aPT_b = 180^circ - angle APT_a - angle BPT_b ] 8. Substituting the known values: [ angle APT_a = varphi quad text{and} quad angle BPT_b = gamma - varphi, ] we get: [ angle T_aPT_b = 180^circ - varphi - (gamma - varphi) = 180^circ - gamma. ] 9.

When P is on the extension of side AB beyond point A, let ( P' ) be this point and ( angle P'CA ) be denoted as ( psi ). 11. Repeating the process: [ angle T'_aP'A = psi, ] [ angle T'_bP'B = psi + gamma, ] and since ( P'A ) and ( P'B ) are collinear, the angle between the tangents at ( P' ) is: [ angle T'_bP'T'_a = (psi + gamma) - psi = gamma. ] 12. Therefore, when P is on the extension of AB, the angle between the tangents is γ. 13. Notably, when P coincides with A or B directly: - If P is at A, we have one tangent coinciding with AB, and the other is simply the exterior angle of the triangle at A, which is again γ (since it corresponds to the originally defined γ). - If P is at B, similar reasoning shows that the angle between tangents also corresponds to γ. 14. Thus, in every placement of P on AB, whether within the segment or its extensions, the angle between the tangents at P to the circumcircles of ∆PAC and ∆PBC is consistently equal to γ. 15.

The average price of the 10 pieces of fruit is 54 cents, so the total cost of the 10 pieces of fruit is 54 * 10 = 540 cents. We can set up the equation for the total cost of the fruit: 40A + 60O = 540 Now, we know that Mary puts back 6 oranges, so the new number of oranges is O - 6. We need to find the average price of the pieces of fruit that she keeps. Since A + O = 10, we can express A as 10 - O.

Since she puts back 6 oranges, she is left with 1 orange. This means she keeps 10 - 6 = 4 pieces of fruit in total (since she puts back 6 oranges out of the 10 pieces of fruit she initially had). The cost of the 1 orange she keeps is 60 cents, and the cost of the 3 apples she keeps is 3 * 40 = 120 cents. The total cost of the fruit she keeps is 60 + 120 = 180 cents.

The conversion factor between km/hr and m/s is: 1 km/hr = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, to convert 90 km/hr to m/s: 90 km/hr = 90 * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) 90 km/hr = 90 * (5/18) m/s 90 km/hr = 25 m/s Now that we have the speed in meters per second, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to cross the electric pole. Since the train only needs to cover its own length to completely pass the pole, we can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance is the length of the train, which is 300 meters, and the speed is 25 m/s.

We are given that the distance traveled downstream in 24 minutes is 9.2 km. Since speed is distance divided by time, we can write the following equation: Distance = Speed * Time We need to convert the time from minutes to hours to match the units of speed (km/hr). There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 24 minutes is 24/60 hours. Now we can set up the equation: 9.2 km = (v + 3) km/hr * (24/60) hr To solve for \\"v\\", we first simplify the time: 24/60 = 0.4 hours Now the equation becomes: 9.2 km = (v + 3) km/hr * 0.4 hr To isolate \\"v\\", we divide both sides of the equation by 0.4 hr: 9.2 km / 0.4 hr = (v + 3) km/hr 23 km/hr = v + 3 km/hr Now we subtract 3 km/hr from both sides to solve for \\"v\\": 23 km/hr - 3 km/hr = v v = 20 km/hr Therefore, the speed of the boat in still water is boxed{20} km/hr."},{"prompt":"Samantha has 12 ounces of a perfume solution containing 40% alcohol.

This means that the set ( B_k ) will hit each sufficiently large integer (and also less than ( a_{k+1} )) at least once. 2. **Main Lemma**: There exist some fixed ( a in mathbb{N} ) and ( N_0 in mathbb{N} ) such that each ( a+1 leq i leq a_{k+1} ) is an element of ( B_k ) for all ( k geq N_0 ). 3. **Proof of the Main Lemma**: As explained in the motivation section, for all ( m geq t ), ( B_m ) will contain each of the numbers ( a_t, cdots, a_{m+1}-1 ). This is because, for ( l geq t ), ( a_{l+1} ) is the smallest positive integer greater than ( a_l ) that is not part of an arithmetic progression containing elements of ( {a_i}_{i geq 1} ).

For example, the first group might contain the numbers (1000000000, 1000000001, ..., 1000000009). 3. **Observe the nature of the groups**: - Within each group, all numbers are \\"neighboring\\" because they differ only in their last digit. Thus, within any given group of 10 numbers, no more than one number can be chosen to avoid having neighboring numbers in the set. 4. **Choosing numbers without neighboring constraints**: - Since each of the (9 times 10^8) groups can contribute at most one number to our final set of non-neighboring numbers, we need to be selective. One systematic way is to choose numbers such that no two chosen numbers in any group are neighboring. - A practical choice is to select from each group the number whose digits sum to a multiple of 10.

The total amount of money from the tickets sold is 2100 dollars: 6.00A + 4.50C = 2100 Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system to find the values of A and C. First, let's solve the first equation for A: A = 400 - C Now we can substitute this expression for A into the second equation: 6.00(400 - C) + 4.50C = 2100 Expanding the equation, we get: 2400 - 6.00C + 4.50C = 2100 Combining like terms, we get: 2400 - 1.50C = 2100 Now, let's isolate C: -1.50C = 2100 - 2400 -1.50C = -300 Divide both sides by -1.50 to find C: C = -300 / -1.50 C = 200 So, boxed{200} children's tickets were sold."},{"prompt":"Consider the equation a^9xy a^8y a^7x = a^6(c^31), and suppose it is equivalent to (a^mx a^n)(a^py a^3) = a^6c^3 for some integers m, n, and p.

The outermost linden in this group would be adjacent to a birch and a linden, and hence the statement on that linden would be correct as per the problem. - This is a contradiction since all statements on lindens must be false.

We show that at least two of these zeros will be in positions such that they are not in the same row or column. - For a matrix with each row and column having at most 3 entries, finding 4 zeros in distinct rows and columns is inevitable. - This means we can always find ( C_{pq} ) and ( C_{rs} ) with ( p ne r ) and ( q ne s ) both equal to zero. 9.

According to the problem, the areas of the triangles formed by the diagonals - ( triangle ABO) , ( triangle CBO), ( triangle ADO), and ( triangle CDO) are equal.

According to the problem, the condition implies: [ text{Area}(triangle ABO) = text{Area}(triangle CBO) ] and [ text{Area}(triangle ADO) = text{Area}(triangle CDO) ] 2. **Analyzing Areas of Triangles:** We recall that the area of a triangle can be given by the formula: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times text{Base} times text{Height} ] Given that the heights of triangles (ABO) and (CBO) from vertices (A) and (C) respectively, fall perpendicularly to the same line (the same altitude from (B)), the areas being equal implies: [ frac{1}{2} times AO times h = frac{1}{2} times CO times h ] Since heights (h) cancel out from both sides of the equation, we obtain: [ AO = CO ] Consequently, point (O) bisects diagonal (AC). 3. **Repeating the Process:** Next, consider the equal areas of triangles (ADO) and (CDO): [ text{Area}(triangle ADO) = text{Area}(triangle CDO) ] Applying the same reasoning as before: [ frac{1}{2} times AO times h' = frac{1}{2} times CO times h' ] This gives: [ DO = BO ] Hence, point (O) also bisects diagonal (BD). 4. **Conclusion:** Since we have shown both diagonals are bisected by point (O), quadrilateral (ABCD) has the property that its diagonals bisect each other.

It is known that all rows of the table are distinct. Prove that there exists a column which, if removed, still leaves a table with all rows distinct. 1. **Assume the contrary**: Suppose the statement is false. This means that for any column (i) ((i = 1, 2, ldots, n)), there are two rows that differ only in their (i)-th elements. 2. **Identify pairs of rows**: For each (i), let’s fix one such pair of rows that differ only in their (i)-th position.

There are two possible moves: - Move 1 unit up (this increases the y-coordinate by 1). - Move 1 unit left (this decreases the x-coordinate by 1). 2. **Analyze the Required Moves:** - To move from (0, n) to (m, m), we need to match the coordinates of both points. - The x-coordinate changes from 0 to m, which means we need to move left m times. - The y-coordinate changes from n to m, so we need to move up n - m times. 3. **Combining all Moves:** - The total number of steps is m left moves and n - m up moves. - Thus, the total number of moves is m + (n - m) = n moves. 4. **Combinatorial Approach:** - From these total n moves, we need to choose m moves to determine which ones are the \\"up\\" moves. - This is because the remaining moves (out of n) will automatically be the \\"left\\" moves. 5. **Applying Binomial Coefficients:** - The number of ways to choose m \\"left\\" moves out of n total moves is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{n}{m} = frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!} ] 6. **Conclusion:** - The number of distinct paths from (0, n) to (m, m) is given by the binomial coefficient: [ boxed{binom{n}{m}} ]"},{"prompt":"A convex ngon A_{1} ldots A_{n} is inscribed in a circle, with no diametrically opposite vertices.

If one such triangle is acute-angled, the statement is trivial because the only triangle we consider is already acute-angled. 2. **Inductive Step: Assume True for n-k** Suppose the statement is true for any n-gon for n geqslant 3 up to k, i.e., for an (n-1)-gon there are at least n-3 acute-angled triangles. We need to show it is also true for an n-gon. 3. **Choosing and Removing Vertices:** Let us fix an acute-angled triangle A_p A_q A_r in our n-gon. We will consider the removal of a vertex A_k which is not one of A_p, A_q, A_r. Therefore, we are left with an (n-1)-gon. 4. **Application of Inductive Hypothesis:** By the inductive hypothesis, the resulting (n-1)-gon has at least (n-1) - 2 = n - 3 acute-angled triangles. 5. **Considering the removed vertex A_k:** - Assume A_k lies on the arc between A_p and A_q that does not contain A_r. - Assess the triangle A_k A_p A_r. Given the angles at A_p A_r A_q constraints: - angle A_p A_r A_k < angle A_p A_r A_q - angle A_k A_p A_r leq angle A_q A_p A_r Since A_p A_q A_r is acute-angled, this implies angle A_r A_p A_k < 90^circ and angle A_k A_p A_r < 90^circ. 6. **Concluding the Inductive Step:** Since removing one vertex still results in at least (n-3) acute-angled triangles and considering the inclusion of the new triangles involving A_k (like A_k A_p A_r), we add at least one more acute-angled triangle than before. 7. **Final Conclusion:** Thus, in total, there are at least n-2 acute-angled triangles in the original n-gon.

First Approach: 1. Assume, for contradiction, that the center (O) of the frying pan lies outside the convex pancake (B). 2. Since (B) is convex, for any point outside (B), there exists a line through that point that does not intersect (B) (this is a property of convex figures). 3. Let us draw such a line through (O). This line divides the frying pan into two halves. 4. Since (O) is outside (B) and the line does not intersect (B), (B) must lie entirely in one of these two halves. 5. Each half of the frying pan has an area of (frac{1}{2}). 6. Therefore, if (B) lies entirely within one half, its area cannot exceed (frac{1}{2}), since the maximum area that can fit in one half is (frac{1}{2}). 7.

Because (O) lies outside (B), none of the points of (B') can lie within (B), as that would contradict the convex nature and the symmetry about (O). 6. Hence, (B) and (B') do not overlap.

Points ( P ) and ( Q ) are the points of tangency of the tangents drawn to the circle ( Gamma ) from point ( A ). 2. Let ( M ) be the midpoint of the segment ([PQ]). 3. Notice that the tangent from point ( A ) forms a right angle with the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. Thus, we have: [ widehat{APO} = 90^circ quad text{and} quad widehat{AQO} = 90^circ ] 4. By the Power of a Point theorem, the power of point ( A ) with respect to the circle ( Gamma ) is given by: [ P_Gamma(A) = AP^2 = AQ^2 ] 5. The power of point ( A ) can also be expressed as ( AK cdot AL ), where ( K ) and ( L ) are points on the circle ( Gamma ). Therefore: [ AP^2 = AK cdot AL ] 6. Since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( [PQ] ), triangles ( AMP ) and ( APO ) are similar by the properties of tangents and right angles: [ triangle AMP sim triangle APO ] 7. From the similarity, we have the proportionality of corresponding sides: [ frac{AM}{AP} = frac{AP}{AO} ] This implies: [ AM cdot AO = AP^2 ] 8. By the Power of a Point theorem: [ AM cdot AO = AK cdot AL ] 9. Since ( K, L, O, ) and ( M ) have been shown to lie on the same circle, we can conclude that the quadrilateral ( KLOM ) is cyclic.

Prove that the area of the resulting pentagon is at least 50 units larger than the original area.","completion":"1. **Initial Setup:** We start with a convex pentagon. Let's denote the vertices of the pentagon as ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 ). 2. **Translation of Lines:** We translate each of the lines that form the sides of the pentagon outward by 4 units in a direction parallel to itself. This operation effectively enlarges the pentagon by a consistent margin around its perimeter. 3. **Constructing Perpendicular Rays:** At each vertex of the original pentagon, we draw rays perpendicular to each adjacent side and extend these rays outward. These rays, being perpendicular to the sides, are naturally parallel to each other in pairs. 4. **Consideration of Angles:** For each vertex of the pentagon, consider the angle formed by the perpendicular rays and the angles between the sides of the pentagon. If we denote the internal angle at vertex (A_i) of the pentagon as (theta_i), the complete angle around (A_i) is (360^circ). From these, subtract the internal angle (theta_i) of the pentagon and the two right angles ((90^circ) each) made by the perpendicular rays. This remaining angle at each vertex is (360^circ - theta_i - 180^circ = 180^circ - theta_i). Because the sum of the internal angles of a pentagon is (540^circ): [ sum_{i=1}^{5} theta_i = 540^circ ] The remaining angles sum to: [ sum_{i=1}^{5} (180^circ - theta_i) = 5 times 180^circ - 540^circ = 360^circ ] 5. **Creating New Shapes:** When the lines are translated outwards, they form new intersections which create a combination of five new rectangles and five kite-like (deltoid) shapes around the original pentagon. 6. **Calculating the Added Area:** Let's calculate the total area of the newly added regions: - The added rectangles are easy to calculate. Each rectangle has its length equal to the side of the pentagon and width equal to 4 units. - The deltoid shape can be analyzed by splitting it into simpler geometric sections. However, let's focus on using another simpler method: 7. **Area of Circular Segments:** We'll consider circular segments at each vertex, which are parts of circles with 4-unit radii. These segments fit perfectly around the pentagon, thus effectively creating an additional complete circle. 8. **Summing Areas:** Since four such segments around each vertex add up to a complete circle: [ text{Total area of circular segments} = pi times 4^2 = 16pi ] Using the approximation (pi approx 3.14): [ 16pi > 16 times 3.14 = 50.24 ] 9. **Conclusion:** Given the total added area includes at least the area of this circle formed by (16pi), which exceeds 50, we conclude that the new pentagon's area is increased by more than 50 square units. Thus, we have shown that the area of the new, larger pentagon is at least 50 square units more than the area of the original pentagon.

For instance, a path of 5 means it traverses 5 line segments in the grid. 3. **Examining Claim for 5 L-Shaped Paths of Length 8**: - Suppose we have 5 paths each of length 8. - Analyzing the condition of vertices: - We know each line segment of length 1 in the grid is shared by exactly two adjoining paths for each pair. - There are 12 boundary nodes (nodes present at the edges of the grid excluding vertices of the corners), and nodes at these locations must necessarily be endpoints of broken paths. - Each path having length 8 requires 2 endpoints per path, hence 5 paths will yield 2 times 5 = 10 endpoints. - However, 12 nodes on the borders, excluding corners, imply more than the possible endpoints required. 4. **Counting Edges and Paths**: - Paths must be non-overlapping in terms of grid lines, which means paths should only share vertices but not edges. - Total edges in a 3 times 3 grid are 3 horizontal lines times 3 vertical blocks and 3 vertical lines times 3 horizontal blocks which equals 2 times (3 + 3) = 24 segments. - Length 8 for each of 5 paths would necessitate 5 times 8 = 40 line segments. 5. **Mathematical Contradiction**: - Calculating line segments available vs. needed: 24 total segments < 40 segments needed, leading to a contradiction that any line segments would be shared among paths, violating our no-overlap condition for different path edges. **Conclusion:** There is non-sufficient edge allocation and non-overlapping conditions violate forming 5 paths of length 8. Hence, it is not possible to form the given grid with 5 paths each of length 8. boxed{text{b}}"},{"prompt":"w many of the baseten numerals for the positive integers less than or equal to 3017 contain the digit 0?

Part (c): Equation of the Escribed Circle (Excircle) in Trilinear Coordinates 1. **Given:** We need to find the equation of the escribed circle tangent to the side ( BC ) in trilinear coordinates. 2. **Equation Formulation:** The equation is given as: [ cos frac{alpha}{2} sqrt{-x} + cos frac{beta}{2} sqrt{y} + cos frac{gamma}{2} sqrt{z} = 0 ] 3. **Expanded Form:** This equation can be rewritten and expanded as: [ cos^4 frac{alpha}{2} x^2 + cos^4 frac{beta}{2} y^2 + cos^4 frac{gamma}{2} z^2 = 2 cos^2 frac{beta}{2} cos^2 frac{gamma}{2} y z - cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} cos^2 frac{beta}{2} x y - cos^2 frac{alpha}{2} cos^2 frac{gamma}{2} x z ] 4. **Proof Similarity:** The proof for this equation follows a similar approach to that used for the inscribed circle in part (b).

We can represent x as mcdot 2^{k}, where m is an odd number and kin mathbb{N}^{*}. This is achieved by repeatedly dividing x by 2 until we get an odd quotient, m. This process ensures that every even number can be uniquely associated with an odd number in this way. 2. **Relation Between x and m in A**: Based on the conditions: - If min A, then x can only be in A if k is even. - If mnotin A, then x can only be in A if k is odd. Therefore, the membership of x in A depends directly on whether m is in A and the parity of k. 3. **Considering Q_{n}**: Let Q_{n} be the set of all odd numbers in P_{n}. The key insight is that the decision to include or exclude an odd number m in/from A determines the inclusion/exclusion of all even numbers that can be expressed as mcdot 2^{k}. Thus, the number of subsets A that satisfy all conditions is equivalent to the number of ways to pick odd numbers to include in A, which is the number of subsets of Q_{n}. 4. **Calculating f(n)**: The function f(n), representing the number of subsets of Q_{n}, depends on whether n is even or odd: - If n is even, the number of odd numbers in P_{n} is frac{n}{2}, so f(n)={2}^{frac{n}{2}}. - If n is odd, the number of odd numbers in P_{n} is frac{n+1}{2}, thus f(n)={2}^{frac{n+1}{2}}. 5. **Applying to P_{10}**: Given P_{10}={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, and since 10 is even, we use the formula for even n: [ f(10) = {2}^{frac{10}{2}} = {2}^{5} = 32 ] Thus, the number of sets A that satisfy all three conditions simultaneously is boxed{32}, which corresponds to choice C."},{"prompt":"Alexis has four times as many mangoes as Dilan and Ashley combined.

Hence, the work done by 10 workers in 30 days is: [ W_{text{initial}} = frac{1}{5} ] 2. **Work Rate of Each Worker:** To find the work rate of one worker per day, we use the equation: [ text{Work done} = text{Work rate} times text{Number of workers} times text{Time} ] So for our case: [ frac{1}{5} = r times 10 times 30 ] Solving for ( r ): [ r = frac{1}{5} div (10 times 30) = frac{1}{5} times frac{1}{300} = frac{1}{1500} ] Thus, each worker’s work rate is: [ r = frac{1}{1500} ] 3. **Remaining Work:** The remaining work to be done after the initial ( 30 ) days (where ( frac{1}{5} ) of the work is completed) is: [ W_{text{remaining}} = 1 - frac{1}{5} = frac{4}{5} ] 4. **Increased Workforce Computation:** After the initial ( 30 ) days, the number of workers is increased by ( 10 ), making the total number of workers ( 20 ).

Therefore, evaluating the original expression for y with these sign considerations, we have: begin{align*} y &= frac{sin θ}{|sin theta|} + frac{|cos θ|}{cos theta} + frac{tan θ}{|tan theta|} &= frac{-sin θ}{|-sin θ|} + frac{|cos θ|}{cos θ} + frac{-tan θ}{|- tan θ|} &= frac{-sin θ}{sin θ} + frac{cos θ}{cos θ} + frac{-tan θ}{tan θ} &= -1 + 1 - 1 &= boxed{-1}. end{align*} Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{B}.

This solution is unique since any deviation would lead to (X_i neq 0), violating the sum condition. - **Case 3: Delta > 0** When (Delta > 0), each quadratic equation has two distinct real roots: [ x_i^{*} = frac{1 - b pm sqrt{(1 - b)^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] Therefore, we have multiple possibilities for the (x_i), leading to multiple solutions for the given system since each can independently take these different values while still satisfying the system of equations. # Conclusion: - For ((b-1)^2 - 4ac < 0), the system has no real solutions. - For ((b-1)^2 - 4ac = 0), the system has a unique solution. - For ((b-1)^2 - 4ac > 0), the system has more than one solution.

This grid is divided into ( n^2 ) smaller equilateral triangles, each with a side length of 1. 2. **Coloring the Grid:** Color the vertices of these smaller triangles using three colors: Red (R), Yellow (Y), and Blue (B). Ensure that in each small equilateral triangle, the vertices are colored using different colors. This can be achieved due to the periodic nature of the triangular grid. 3. **Ensuring Vertex Separation:** Within this colored grid, any equilateral triangle with side length 1 will have its three vertices colored distinctly. This implies that the colors of vertices forming any triangle will always be either all different or all the same. 4. **Elimination Process:** Perform an \\"elimination\\" step by removing all vertices of the least frequent color from the grid.

We start with the given function ( S_r(n) = 1^r + 2^r + cdots + n^r ), where ( n ) is a positive integer and ( r ) is a rational number. We are given that ( S_a(n) = (S_b(n))^c ) for all positive integers ( n ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are positive rationals and ( c ) is a positive integer. We need to find all such triples ((a, b, c)) that satisfy this condition. 2. Asymptotically, ( S_r(n) ) grows like ( frac{n^{r+1}}{r+1} ). This is derived from the fact that the sum of the first ( n ) ( r )-th powers can be approximated by the integral: [ int_1^n x^r , dx = left[ frac{x^{r+1}}{r+1} right]_1^n = frac{n^{r+1}}{r+1} - frac{1^{r+1}}{r+1} approx frac{n^{r+1}}{r+1} ] for large ( n ). 3. Given ( S_a(n) = (S_b(n))^c ), we substitute the asymptotic forms: [ frac{n^{a+1}}{a+1} approx left( frac{n^{b+1}}{b+1} right)^c ] Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: [ frac{n^{a+1}}{a+1} approx frac{n^{c(b+1)}}{(b+1)^c} ] 4. Equating the exponents of ( n ) on both sides, we get: [ a + 1 = c(b + 1) ] 5. Equating the coefficients, we get: [ frac{1}{a+1} = frac{1}{(b+1)^c} ] This implies: [ a + 1 = (b + 1)^c ] 6. From the two equations ( a + 1 = c(b + 1) ) and ( a + 1 = (b + 1)^c ), we get: [ c(b + 1) = (b + 1)^c ] Dividing both sides by ( b + 1 ) (assuming ( b + 1 neq 0 )), we get: [ c = (b + 1)^{c-1} ] 7. We now analyze the equation ( c = (b + 1)^{c-1} ) for positive rational ( b ) and positive integer ( c ). 8. For ( c = 1 ): [ 1 = (b + 1)^0 = 1 ] This is always true, and from ( a + 1 = c(b + 1) ), we get ( a = b ). Thus, the nice triples are ( (k, k, 1) ) for any positive rational ( k ). 9. For ( c neq 1 ): [ c = (b + 1)^{c-1} ] Since ( b + 1 ) must be an integer, let ( b + 1 = k ) where ( k ) is an integer. Then: [ c = k^{c-1} ] We need to find integer solutions for ( c ) and ( k ). 10. For ( c = 2 ): [ 2 = k^1 implies k = 2 implies b = 1 ] Substituting ( b = 1 ) into ( a + 1 = c(b + 1) ): [ a + 1 = 2 cdot 2 = 4 implies a = 3 ] Thus, the nice triple is ( (3, 1, 2) ). 11. For ( c geq 3 ): [ c = k^{c-1} ] This equation has no solutions for ( c geq 3 ) because ( k geq 2 ) would make ( k^{c-1} ) grow too fast compared to ( c ).

The time it takes for person A to process 25 of these components is equal to the time it takes for person B to process 20 of these components. Find out how many of these components person B processes per hour.","completion":"To solve the problem, we start by defining the number of components person B processes per hour as x. This means person A processes x + 2 components per hour because it's given that person A processes 2 more components per hour than person B. The problem states that the time it takes for person A to process 25 components is the same as the time it takes for person B to process 20 components. We can express this relationship as a ratio of components to time, which gives us the equation: [ frac{25}{x+2} = frac{20}{x} ] To solve for x, we cross-multiply: [ 25x = 20(x + 2) ] Expanding the equation: [ 25x = 20x + 40 ] Subtracting 20x from both sides: [ 5x = 40 ] Dividing both sides by 5: [ x = 8 ] After solving the equation, we find that x = 8. This means person B processes 8 components per hour. To ensure this solution is valid, we check that it satisfies the original conditions of the problem. Substituting x = 8 into the equation, we get: [ frac{25}{8+2} = frac{20}{8} ] Simplifying both sides: [ frac{25}{10} = frac{20}{8} ] [ 2.5 = 2.5 ] Since both sides are equal, x = 8 is indeed a valid solution.

Finally, ( T ) is called balanced if the average of the elements of ( T ) is a median number of ( T ). Show that the number of nonempty balanced subsets of ({1, ldots, n}) is odd.","completion":"\`\`\`markdown 1. **Understanding the Problem**: Given a strictly positive integer n and a non-empty subset T subset {1, ldots, n}, a number m is called a median of T if there are as many elements of T less than or equal to m as there are elements of T greater than or equal to m. The subset T is called balanced if the mean of the elements of T is a median of T. We aim to show that the number of non-empty balanced subsets of {1, ldots, n} is odd. 2. **Mean and Median of Balanced Sets**: To illustrate the concept, let's consider the set {1, n}. The mean is frac{1 + n}{2}, which also serves as the median since there are exactly as many elements (one in this case) above and below frac{n+1}{2}. Hence, this subset is balanced. 3. **Formation of Balanced Subsets**: We need to construct these balanced subsets. For a fixed n, given a subset A subset {1, ldots, n}, let's define the set n + 1 - A as {n + 1 - k mid k in A}. For instance, if A = {1, 2, 3}, then n + 1 - A = {n-2, n-1, n}. If A is a balanced subset of {1, ldots, n}, then n + 1 - A must be balanced too. 4. **Arithmetic Mean of Transformed Sets**: Let a_1 < ldots < a_r be the elements of A, with m being the arithmetic mean of these elements. The arithmetic mean hat{m} of the elements of n + 1 - A is: [ hat{m} = frac{(n+1-a_1) + ldots + (n+1-a_r)}{r} = frac{r(n+1) - (a_1 + ldots + a_r)}{r} = n+1 - m ] Additionally, if a geq m, then n+1-a leq hat{m}, and vice versa. This ensures that n+1-A is balanced if A is balanced. 5. **Pairing Balanced Sets**: The idea is to pair A and n+1-A. Notably, n+1-(n+1-A) = A. Hence, we can partition the set of balanced subsets into pairs: {A, n+1-A}. An important observation is that the set P = {A subset {1, ldots, n}, A neq n+1-A} can be partitioned into pairs, so |P| is even. 6. **Counting Palindromic Sets**: We need to determine the remaining balanced sets, where A = n+1-A, called palindromic sets. For such a set A, if k in A, then n+1-k in A, making frac{n+1}{2} a median and mean of A. 7. **Number of Palindromic Sets**: Each palindromic set is determined by whether or not specific pairs are included from: [ mathcal{F} = left{{1, n}, {2, n-1}, ldots, left{leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2}rightrfloor, leftlceil frac{n+1}{2}rightrceilright} right} ] Each pair can be either included or excluded independently, leading to (2^{leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2}rightrfloor}) combinations. Excluding the empty set gives us: [ 2^{leftlfloor frac{n+1}{2}rightrfloor} - 1 ] 8. **Conclusion**: Since the number of palindromic sets is always odd (because (2^x - 1) is odd for any integer x), and the remainder of the balanced subsets forming pairs {A, n+1-A} is even, the total number of non-empty balanced subsets of {1, ldots, n}) is odd.

Using this within the given equation, we get: log_{2}a + frac{log_{2}b}{-1} = 2 Simplifying further, we have: log_{2}a - log_{2}b = 2 The subtraction of logarithms with the same base is equivalent to the logarithm of the quotient, thus we have: log_{2}frac{a}{b} = 2 Exponentiating both sides with the base 2, we can remove the logarithm and solve for the quotient: 2^2 = frac{a}{b} Therefore, frac{a}{b} = 4, which can be rearranged to express a in terms of b: a = 4b ,.

Each room is either inhabited by a liar or a knight. Knights always tell the truth, and liars always lie. Each person states that \\"At least one of the neighboring rooms has a liar.\\" 2. **Identifying key constraints**: - If a knight says that at least one neighboring room has a liar, then that statement must be true. - If a liar says that at least one neighboring room has a liar, then that statement must be false, implying all their neighbors are knights. 3. **Considering pairs of rooms**: Note that two neighboring rooms cannot both be inhabited by liars because if they were, they would both be telling the truth saying that they have a liar as a neighbor, which contradicts their nature as liars. Therefore, at most one room in each pair of neighboring rooms can be a liar. 4. **Maximizing the number of liars**: - We take advantage of color-coding the 4 times 4 grid like a chessboard with alternating colors (black and white squares). Since each color covers half the grid, each will have 8 rooms. - To satisfy the condition that every room that contains a person says that at least one neighboring room is a liar, we need to place liars and knights such that their statements fit this condition perfectly. 5. **Placing the liars and knights**: - Consider placing all liars (maximum possible number) in rooms of one color (say black), and all knights in the other color (say white). This satisfies the scenario described. Each liar (in black rooms) will have only knight neighbors, but the knight neighbors will ensure the liars' statements (lies) are false. Each knight (in white rooms), when stating the existence of a neighboring liar, is truthful. 6. **Verification of the solution**: - By arranging the grid as described with liars and knights in alternative pattern colors, we cover all rooms once. - Each liar’s statement (in black rooms) that there’s at least one neighboring liar will be false, satisfying the liar’s nature. - Each knight (in white rooms) will truthfully state that they have a liar neighboring them, thus satisfying the knight’s nature.

However, since we're interested in the sign of the product, we simply look at the product x(x-1). This step avoids the division by zero issue and simplifies the inequality to: [ x(x-1) lt 0 ] 2. **Solve the Quadratic Inequality**: To find when the product x(x-1) is less than zero, we identify the roots of the equation x(x-1) = 0, which are x = 0 and x = 1. These roots divide the number line into intervals. We test each interval to see where the product is negative: - For x < 0, both x and (x-1) are negative, so their product is positive. - For 0 < x < 1, x is positive but (x-1) is negative, making their product negative. - For x > 1, both x and (x-1) are positive, so their product is positive. Therefore, the product x(x-1) is negative only in the interval (0, 1). 3. **Write the Solution Set**: The solution set of the inequality frac{{x-1}}{x} lt 0 is the interval where the product x(x-1) is negative, which is (0, 1).

Let X be the midpoint of segment EC. Then we have: MX = frac{BE}{2} 3. Using the property of cevians in a triangle: - A cevian (such as AM or MX) must be less than or equal to one of the sides of the triangle originating from the same vertex. 4. From the given condition BE geq 2AM, we have: MX geq AM 5. Since AM < AC and MX < MC, it follows that M must lie within the limits set by these distances. Extending this inequality provides us with: MX < MC quad text{(since } M text{ is on } BC text{ and } MX text{ is shorter than } BCtext{)} Additionally, we have: AM < MC 6. Consequently, point A must lie inside the circle with diameter BC. This is because if A lies closer than the circle’s radius (which is half the side length BC): - Therefore, by definition, angle A is obtuse. 7. To verify by contradiction: 7.1 Assume that angle A is not obtuse. The center O of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC would then either lie on BC or on the opposite side of A relative to BC. Applying the triangle inequalities in this scenario, we get a contradiction: 2AM geq 2AO = OB + OC geq BC > BE This contradicts the given condition since BE geq 2AM was assumed. 8. To visualize this, let us consider constructing triangle ABD within a parallelogram ABDC where AM and BE extend to cross at point Y. The similarity of triangles AYE and DYB confirms that: BE geq 2AM = AD Hence, BY geq YD by triangle inequality in triangle AYD. Conclusion. From the setup, since BY < AD, A must be within the area of calculation proving that angle A is obtuse in triangle ABC. Thus, in conclusion, triangle ABC is obtuse. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"On a construction site, the Laker cement factory provided 500 bags of cement sold to Mr. Zander at 10 per bag.

Since 3 students attended on their own, we subtract them from the total number of students who attended the prom: 123 students (total) - 3 students (on their own) = 120 students Now, these 120 students either came as couples or in groups larger than 2. Since couples consist of 2 people, we can divide the number of these students by 2 to find out how many pairs there were: 120 students / 2 = 60 pairs So, there were 60 pairs of students who came as couples or attended in groups larger than 2. Now, let's include the chaperones in the total count of attendees. We have 123 students + 7 chaperones = 130 total attendees. The question states that the total number of attendees including the chaperones is x.

A quartic polynomial is a polynomial of degree 4. It can be represented as ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e, where a neq 0. 2. A quadratic polynomial is a polynomial of degree 2. It can be represented as fx^2 + gx + h, where f neq 0. When we add these two polynomials, the highest degree term in the resulting polynomial will be the quartic term from the quartic polynomial, assuming a neq 0. The quadratic terms and lower degree terms will combine accordingly. Therefore, the resulting polynomial will have a degree of 4 at most. This means the sum can either retain the quartic term, making it a quartic polynomial, or, in a special case where the quartic term coefficients sum to zero, result in a lower degree polynomial.

Since there was only 1 rainy day last week, Mo drank n cups of hot chocolate. Let's denote the number of cups of tea Mo drinks on non-rainy mornings as t. Since Mo drank 10 more cups of tea than hot chocolate, we can express this as: t = n + 10 We also know that Mo drank a total of 26 cups of tea and hot chocolate together last week. This can be expressed as: n (cups of hot chocolate) + t (cups of tea) = 26 Substituting the expression for t from above, we get: n + (n + 10) = 26 Combining like terms, we have: 2n + 10 = 26 Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 2n = 16 Dividing both sides by 2, we find: n = 8 So, Mo drinks 8 cups of hot chocolate on a rainy morning.

According to the problem, 27% of these female officers were on duty. So, the number of female officers on duty can be represented as 0.27F. The problem also states that the ratio of male to female officers on duty is 4:3. This means that for every 4 male officers on duty, there are 3 female officers on duty. If we let M represent the number of male officers on duty, then we can express the number of female officers on duty as (3/4)M, because for every 4 males, there are 3 females. We know that the total number of officers on duty is 275, which is the sum of male and female officers on duty. So we can write the equation: M + 0.27F = 275 We also know that the number of female officers on duty is (3/4)M, so we can substitute this into the equation: M + (3/4)M = 275 Now, let's solve for M: (4/4)M + (3/4)M = 275 (7/4)M = 275 M = 275 * (4/7) M = 1100/7 M = 157.14 (approximately) Since the number of male officers must be a whole number, we can round M to 157.

Now, we know that these 118 female officers represent 27% of the total number of female officers on the police force. So we can set up the equation: 0.27F = 118 To find F, we divide both sides by 0.27: F = 118 / 0.27 F ≈ 437.04 Since the number of female officers must be a whole number, we can round F to 437.

After placing the order, Ivan Ivanovich received a message from another company (the delivery service), stating that the laptop and headphones would be delivered on different days with about a oneweek interval: first the headphones, then the laptop. The buyer has the option to return any purchased item even after receiving it (under the return conditions). (a) Explain why, with free delivery, it might be beneficial for the delivery service to deliver items from one order on different days? This delivery policy is used by many large logistics companies delivering goods to end customers. (b) If the buyer has the option to return any purchased item after receiving it, how can the company selling the office equipment limit the buyer's desire to keep the free headphones while returning the laptop? Provide an example of a mechanism the company should use to achieve this and explain how it works on the buyer.","completion":"**(a)** There are several reasons why it might be beneficial for a delivery company to deliver items from a single order on different days. We will consider a few factors that might contribute to this decision: 1. **Different Arrival Times of Goods at the Warehouse**: Products ordered from an online store may arrive at the warehouse at different times. For example, the headphones may arrive at the warehouse earlier than the laptop. 2. **Different Suppliers Located in Various Geographical Areas**: The suppliers of the headphones and the laptop might be located in different cities or regions. Hence, the items are received at different times. 3. **Warehouses Located in Different Areas**: The online store's warehouses, where different items are stored, may be situated in various parts of the city or region. Consequently, consolidating all items to a single location before delivery may not be efficient. Additionally, the costs associated with storing each product in warehouses and the logistics involved in combining all items from a customer's order into a single delivery can be significant. It might be more cost-effective to deliver the items on different days. Large items like office equipment may occupy a lot of space and may require special transportation conditions. Hence, bulky items may be inconvenient to deliver alongside smaller items, and smaller items might be cheaper to deliver separately. **(b)** The company selling office equipment can adopt a mechanism to prevent the customer from keeping the free headphones and returning the laptop. Here is an example mechanism and its principle of operation: 1. **Price Segmentation**: The company can split the price of the items into two parts on the invoice. For example, list the price of the headphones as 15,000 RUB and the price of the laptop as 115,000 RUB. When delivering these items on separate days, the purchaser will receive a receipt for the corresponding amount split - as specified in the invoice for the delivered item. If the payment was not completed before the delivery of the headphones, then the customer will need to pay the specified amount upon receiving the headphones. Thus, if the headphones are delivered first and the customer chooses to return the laptop, they will have already paid 15,000 RUB for the headphones. This mechanism disincentivizes the customer from returning the laptop once the headphones are received, as the discount associated with the combined purchase becomes more apparent. In conclusion, by billing the customer distinctly for each part of the order, the company ensures that the customer has little financial incentive to return part of the order.

Extend the distance PB to intersect the circle again at point D such that PD = PB. Consequently, triangle PBD is an equilateral triangle, which means PB = PD. 5.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the cherries for the cherry pie. She needs a four-pound bag for 14, so the cost for the cherries is 14.

Notice that (AB + CD = AD + BC = 5). This means the sum of the distances from (B) to (A) and from (C) to (D) equals the sum of the distances from (A) to (D) and from (B) to (C). This property allows the points (B) and (D) to lie on a hyperbola with (A) and (C) as foci. 2. Let’s assume (A(-c, 0)) and (C(c, 0)), making the distance between (A) and (C) equal to (2c). The length of the major axis of the hyperbola is given by: [ a = frac{5}{2} ] The focal distance (2c) relates to the eccentricity (e) by: [ e = frac{2c}{5} ] 3. Let points (B(x_1, y_1)) and (D(x_2, y_2)).

Since ( overrightarrow{AC} = (2c, 0) ) and ( overrightarrow{BD} = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1) ), the dot product follows: [ overrightarrow{AC} cdot overrightarrow{BD} = (2c)(x_2 - x_1) ] 6.

In this situation, both binomial coefficients ( C_{p-k+1}^{k} ) and ( C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} ) are zero according to the properties of binomial coefficients. Similarly, if ( 2k = p + 1 ), both coefficients are 1. Therefore, to avoid trivial cases, we will proceed under the assumption ( 2k leq p ). 2. **Expanding Binomial Coefficients:** We start by expressing ( C_{p-k+1}^{k} ) and ( C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} ) in factorials: [ C_{p-k+1}^{k} = frac{(p-k+1)!}{k!(p-k+1-k)!} = frac{(p-k+1)!}{k!(p-2k+1)!} ] [ C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} = frac{(p-k-1)!}{(k-2)!(p-k-1-(k-2))!} = frac{(p-k-1)!}{(k-2)!(p-2k+1)!} ] 3. **Consolidating the Differences:** Simplify the expression ( C_{p-k+1}^{k} - C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} ): [ C_{p-k+1}^{k} - C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} = frac{(p-k+1)!}{k!(p-2k+1)!} - frac{(p-k-1)!}{(k-2)!(p-2k+1)!} ] [ = frac{(p-k-1)!}{k!(p-2k+1)!} left( (p-k+1)(p-k) - k(k-1) right) ] Breaking down the expression inside the parentheses: [ (p-k+1)(p-k) - k(k-1) = (p-k)(p-k+1) - k^2 + k ] Since ( k leq p-2 ), we can further simplify: [ (p-k+1)(p-k) - k^2 + k = p^2 - 2pk + p - k^2 + k ] Notice that the expression simplifies to: [ p(p - 2k + 1) ] 4. **Final Expression:** Substitute this back into the binomial difference: [ C_{p-k+1}^{k} - C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} = frac{(p-k-1)!}{k!(p-2k+1)!} cdot p(p - 2k + 1) ] [ = frac{p(p-k-1)!}{k!(p-2k)!} ] Since ( p ) is a prime number, it is not a factor of any term in the denominator. Thus, we see that the entire expression is an integer and divisible by ( p ). Therefore, ( C_{p-k+1}^{k} - C_{p-k-1}^{k-2} ) is divisible by ( p ). (blacksquare) Part (b) We need to evaluate if the converse is true. Specifically, determine if ( C_{n-k+1}^{k} - C_{n-k-1}^{k-2} ) being divisible by ( n ) implies ( n ) is prime. 1. **Consider ( p )-Composite:** Suppose ( p ) is composite and let one of its factors be ( q ) such that ( p = nq ). Then following a similar arrangement: [ frac{C_{p-q+1}^{q} - C_{p-q-1}^{q-2}}{p} = frac{(p-q-1)!}{q!(p-2q)!} ] 2. **Analyzing Factorial Terms:** The numerator contains terms from ( p-2q+1 ) to ( p-q-1 ). Importantly, none of these terms is ( q ), but ( q ) appears in the denominator. 3. **Seeing Non-Integer Result:** Hence the fraction cannot yield an integer since there will be a factor ( q ) in the denominator which does not have a corresponding factor in the numerator. Therefore, the difference ( C_{p-q+1}^{q} - C_{p-q-1}^{q-2} ) is not divisible by ( p ). Thus, the converse statement does not hold.

Since the lines are parallel and not horizontal, we can write: [ f(x) = ax + b quad text{and} quad g(x) = ax + c, ] where ( a neq 0 ). 2. Let's consider the function: [ h(x) = (f(x))^2 + 5g(x). ] Expanding ( h(x) ), [ h(x) = (ax + b)^2 + 5(ax + c). ] We can expand this further: [ h(x) = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 + 5ax + 5c. ] Then combine like terms: [ h(x) = a^2x^2 + (2ab + 5a)x + (b^2 + 5c). ] 3.

Distance covered downstream = 120 meters = 0.12 kilometers Time taken = 23.998080153587715 seconds = 23.998080153587715 / 3600 hours (since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) Now, let's calculate the speed while rowing downstream (Speed_downstream) using the formula: Speed = Distance / Time Speed_downstream = 0.12 km / (23.998080153587715 / 3600 hours) Speed_downstream = 0.12 km / (0.006666133376552698 hours) Speed_downstream ≈ 18 kmph Now, we know that the speed downstream is the sum of the man's speed in still water (Speed_still) and the speed of the current (3 kmph). Therefore: Speed_downstream = Speed_still + Speed_current 18 kmph = Speed_still + 3 kmph Speed_still = 18 kmph - 3 kmph Speed_still = 15 kmph So, the man's speed in still water is boxed{15} kmph."},{"prompt":"Given that f(x) is an even function defined on the domain mathbb{R}, and when x > 0, f(x)=x^{2}4x, determine the solution set for the inequality f(x+2) < 5.","completion":"Since f(x) is an even function, we have f(|x+2|)=f(x+2), Then, the inequality f(x+2) < 5 can be transformed into f(|x+2|) < 5, Which is equivalent to (|x+2|+1)(|x+2|-5) < 0, Thus, we obtain |x+2| < 5, Solving for x, we get -7 < x < 3, Therefore, the solution set for the inequality f(x+2) < 5 is (-7,3).

Thus, it does not match the question's requirement for an incorrect statement. **Option B**: The statement that the perpendicular bisectors of the three sides of a triangle intersect at one point, and this point is equidistant from the three vertices, describes the circumcenter of a triangle. This is another well-established fact in triangle geometry, indicating that this statement is also correct. Therefore, it does not fulfill the criteria for being the incorrect statement sought by the question. **Option C**: The statement that an isosceles triangle with an angle of 60^{circ} must be an equilateral triangle is based on the properties of triangles. In an isosceles triangle, if any angle is 60^{circ}, the other two angles must also be 60^{circ} to satisfy the total sum of 180^{circ} for the angles in a triangle.

While it's true that propositions can have converses, the statement that every theorem may not necessarily have a converse is misleading. Theorems can have converses, but whether those converses are true or not is a separate matter of proof.

Let's denote: - AD as the altitude from vertex A to side BC. - BM as the median from vertex B to side AC. Given that the median BM and the altitude from C are equal indicates a specific relationship in the triangle. The median splits AC into two equal segments. 3. **Position of Vertex B and Perpendicular Observation:** To use the fact that angle A = 30^circ, consider the properties of a triangle with a 30^circ angle. In a right-angled triangle, where one angle is 30^circ, a key property is that the side opposite 30^circ is half the hypotenuse. 4. **Circle and Diameter Argument:** The condition that both the median from B and the height from C are equal to half the side they are drawn to suggest that B is on the circle with the diameter AC. This observation implies a right triangle scenario: Notice that a right-angled triangle shares the property that the altitude and median split the sides in such a way that involves symmetrical properties around a circle. 5. **Conclusion Using Angle Sum Property:** The angles in a triangle sum to 180^circ.

Simplifying, we get S_n = 3 cdot frac {frac {1}{2}(1- (frac {1}{2})^n)}{1- frac {1}{2}} + frac {n(n+1)}{2} - 2n = -frac {3}{2^n} + frac {n^2 - 3n}{2} + 3. For T_n=b_1+b_2+...+b_n, we have T_n = -frac {3}{2} cdot (1- frac {1}{2^n}) = -frac {3}{2} + frac {3}{2^{n+1}}. For the sequence left{ frac {S_n+lambda T_n}{n}right} to be an arithmetic sequence, we require frac {S_n+lambda T_n}{n} = An + B, which means S_n+lambda T_n = An^2 + Bn = frac {n^2 - 3n}{2} + 3 - frac {3}{2^n} + lambda left(-frac {3}{2} + frac {3}{2^{n+1}}right). To satisfy this relationship, we need 3 - frac {3}{2^n} + lambda left(-frac {3}{2} + frac {3}{2^{n+1}}right) = 0. Setting lambda = 2 makes the above equation true.

For this product to satisfy the divisibility condition by 25, one of the terms must be divisible by 25, or both terms should end in 0 or 5.

For divisibility by 125, one factor must be divisible by 125, as the numbers must be relatively prime to 125.

As the ribbon crosses the side OA_1 of the second section, it will continue as the same strip on the second unfolded part until it reaches the side OA_2, representing the second loop, and so on. 5. To analyze this configuration, assume the ribbon makes n loops around the cone where n > frac{pi}{alpha}. This implies our strip, per condition, cannot pass through the point O, hence it will intersect the rays OA_0, OA_1, ldots, OA_n. However, this situation leads to a contradiction: [ pi > angle A_0OA_n = nalpha > pi ] This results in an inconsistency since the angular sum exceeds the possible angle limit. 6. Consequently, the number of loops n that the ribbon can make surrounding the cone is bounded by frac{pi}{alpha}, affirming that it is definitively finite. # Conclusion: Therefore, it is impossible to wrap the inextensible ribbon around the infinite cone to achieve an infinite number of loops. boxed{text{No}}"},{"prompt":"w many positive factors does 180 have?","completion":"The prime factorization of 180 is 180 = 2^2 cdot 3^2 cdot 5.

We can do this by using the information given about the time it takes to cross the platform. When the train crosses the platform, it covers the distance equal to the length of the train plus the length of the platform. So the total distance covered when crossing the platform is: Distance = Length of train + Length of platform Distance = 300 m + 285 m Distance = 585 m We are given that the train crosses this distance in 39 seconds. Therefore, the speed of the train (Speed = Distance / Time) is: Speed = 585 m / 39 s Speed = 15 m/s Now, to find out how long it takes for the train to cross the signal pole, we only need to consider the length of the train, as the signal pole can be assumed to have negligible width compared to the length of the train. Since the speed of the train is constant, the time it takes to cross the signal pole (which is the same as the length of the train) can be calculated using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed The distance in this case is the length of the train, which is 300 m.

In each pair, there can only be one such player participating twice. 5. **Count all participants:** - Therefore, to accumulate 2n+6 participations, other players must participate exactly once in these games. - Hence, the steps of players who played in game g_{1} must be either n+1 or n+2. 6. **Show the existence of a player with steps n+2:** - Assume a player has every one of their steps sized ( n+2 ). - The total number of steps this player takes in 2n+1 games is ((n+2)(2n+1) = 2n^2 + 5n + 2). 7. **Total games calculation:** - The total number of games is frac{(2n+3)(2n+2)}{2} = 2n^2 + 5n + 3. - This one additional game indicates this player participated in both the first and the last game. 8. **Proof by contradiction:** - Suppose every player's step is n+1. - Consider a player X, who took their first step last. Let Y be their opponent in game t. - If player Y had the last step ending at t, their last step before this must be at q to (q+n+1). 9. **Step deductions:** - Sequentially, the following steps must follow n+2 until game t by player Y. - Then t = q+(n+1)+k(n+2). - On the other hand, player's preceding steps X would have steps n+2. - If X had at least k such steps preceding t, X participated in subsequent t-(n+1)-k(n+2)=q. - Thus, X and Y meet twice creating a contradiction. 10. **Conclude contradiction:** - If all the previous steps of player X were less, thus making the first game number at least q+(n+2) ge n+3. However, every player must play in the first n+2 games indicating another contradiction.

Five people said the same thing: There are more liars. What did the other five people say?","completion":": 1. **Understanding the Problem**: On the island, inhabitants are either knights, who always tell the truth, or liars, who always lie. A tourist asked each of the 10 inhabitants whether there are more knights, more liars, or an equal number of both in their group. Five people responded, \\"There are more liars.\\" 2. **Analyzing the Statements**: Let's denote the number of knights as ( K ) and the number of liars as ( L ). The statements by the first five people that \\"There are more liars\\" can be either true or false. - If the statement \\"There are more liars\\" was true, then ( L > K ). In this case, all five people who made this statement would be knights because knights tell the truth. - If the statement \\"There are more liars\\" was false, then ( K ge L ). In this case, all five people who made this statement would be liars because liars always lie. 3. **Determining the Group Composition**: Since exactly five people made the statement \\"There are more liars,\\" we need to consider the implications: - If exactly five people are knights and they tell the truth that ( L > K ), then one would expect more than half to be liars (( L ) should exceed ( K )). However, this leads to a contradiction as we assumed the statement was true if they were knights. - If exactly five people are liars, saying \\"There are more liars,\\" then they are lying, meaning ( L le K ). This would imply that the statement about more liars cannot be true and must be false. 4. **Concluding the Group Composition**: The only scenario that fits is having an equal number of knights and liars: - If ( K = L ), then no one would truthfully say there are more liars. Thus, being all knights and liars, they would perfectly balance each other's statements, allowing for five liars to falsely say there are more liars. 5. **What Did the Remaining Five Say?**: Therefore, the remaining five people must have said \\"There are an equal number of knights and liars\\".

Specifically, let ( A = lceil frac{n}{2} rceil ) and ( B = lfloor frac{n}{2} rfloor ). This ensures that the sizes of ( A ) and ( B ) are as balanced as possible. 2. **Assign numbers to edges between sets:** For any edge ( e = xy ) where ( x in A ) and ( y in B ), assign an integer less than or equal to ( |A||B| = lfloor frac{n^2}{4} rfloor ). This means that the edges between the two sets ( A ) and ( B ) will have the smallest numbers assigned to them. 3. **Assign remaining numbers to other edges:** Assign any of the remaining values to all the other edges, i.e., the edges within set ( A ) and within set ( B ). 4. **Analyze the sum of numbers in any triangle:** Consider any triangle in the graph. At least one of the edges of the triangle must join two vertices that are either both in ( A ) or both in ( B ). The number assigned to this edge is at least ( |A||B| + 1 = lfloor frac{n^2}{4} rfloor + 1 ). 5. **Compare with the required bound:** Since ( lfloor frac{n^2}{4} rfloor + 1 ) is a lower bound for the sum of the numbers assigned to the edges of any triangle, we need to show that this is greater than or equal to ( 3n - 1000 log_2 log_2 n ). 6. **Verify the inequality:** [ lfloor frac{n^2}{4} rfloor + 1 > 3n - 1000 log_2 log_2 n ] For large ( n ), ( frac{n^2}{4} ) grows much faster than ( 3n ) and ( 1000 log_2 log_2 n ).

Since frac {c}{a}= frac {1}{2}, we have a-c=1, thus a=2, c=1, and therefore b= sqrt {3}. Hence, the minimum distance from points on the trajectory of P to plane gamma is 3- sqrt {3}. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A}.

Notice that (5+sqrt{26})^n + (5-sqrt{26})^n is an integer. Let's understand why this expression is an integer. 2. **Integer Analysis:** - Since both (5+sqrt{26}) and (5-sqrt{26}) are roots of a quadratic polynomial with rational coefficients, say (x^2 - 10x + (text{some constant}) = 0), their powers when added together yield an integer. 3. **Inequalities for Bounds:** We examine the term ((5 - sqrt{26})^n). - First, calculate the magnitude of (5 - sqrt{26}): [ 5 - sqrt{26} ] - We establish an inequality for this term: [ 5 - sqrt{26} = frac{1}{sqrt{26}+5} ] Observe: [ 0 < sqrt{26} - 5 < 1 ] Hence, [ 0 < frac{1}{sqrt{26} + 5} < 0.1 ] 4. **Behavior for Even and Odd (n):** **Case 1: (n) is even:** - When (n) is even, ((5 - sqrt{26})^n) remains positive. - Consequently, [ 0 < (5-sqrt{26})^n < frac{1}{10^n} ] - The integer part of ((5+sqrt{26})^n) plus a very small positive fraction leaves the fractional part to be all 9s up to at least the first (n) digits because ((5+sqrt{26})^n)'s fractional part is essentially 1 - epsilon where (epsilon) is very small: [ begin{align*} text{If }a &= (5+sqrt{26})^n, text{then } a& = lfloor a rfloor + {a} text{ where } {a} text{ is the fractional part}. end{align*} ] Here, ({a} = 1 - epsilon implies epsilon} < frac{1}{10^n}).

Thus, after 2 or 4 moves, he must be back at either ((0,0,0)), ((1,1,0)), ((0,1,1)), or ((1,0,1)). 3. **Unreachable Vertex**: After 3 moves (odd number), if Travis is at the vertex ((1,1,1)), he cannot return to ((0,0,0)) on the fourth move as the parity would mismatch. Thus, after odd moves, he cannot be back at ((0,0,0)). We now need to calculate the probabilities step-by-step: 4. **Probability Analysis**: - **Probability of 4th Move**: If Travis is not at ((1,1,1)) after three moves, he has a (frac{1}{3}) chance of returning to the original vertex ((0,0,0)) on the 4th move. - **Dominant Probability**: From any vertex other than ((1,1,1)), the probability to move to ((0,0,0)) on the last move remains (frac{1}{3}), because each vertex has three adjacent vertices. 5. **Breaking Down the Steps**: - **At 3 Moves**: The probability that Travis is at ((1,1,1)) after 3 moves is (frac{2}{9}) (as computed by examining combinations of moves). - **Not at ((1,1,1))**: So, the probability that Travis is not at ((1,1,1)) after 3 moves is (1 - frac{2}{9} = frac{7}{9}). 6. **Combining Probabilities**: - Given that after 3 moves, Travis is not at ((1,1,1)), the probability of reaching ((0,0,0)) on the 4th move is (frac{1}{3}). - Thus, the combined probability is: [ P(text{return to } (0,0,0)) = frac{7}{9} times frac{1}{3} = frac{7}{27} ] # Conclusion: The probability that Travis is back at the vertex where he started after four moves on the cube is given by: [ boxed{frac{7}{27}} ]"},{"prompt":"Observe the following inequalities: 1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3} > 1, 1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}+cdots +frac{1}{7} > frac{3}{2}, 1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}+cdots +frac{1}{15} > 2, cdots Following this pattern, what is the nth inequality?","completion":"This problem primarily tests analogical reasoning and the key to solving it is finding the pattern in the inequalities.

We start by understanding the setup: we are given a triangle whose sides are the diagonals of three different parallelograms. The sides of these parallelograms are parallel to two mutually perpendicular lines, ( l ) and ( p ). 2. Consider the three parallelograms. Each parallelogram is constructed in such a way that its sides align with the lines ( l ) and ( p ). Note that these parallelograms share the property of having diagonals that lie on the sides of the triangle. 3. Observe that if we overlay these three parallelograms, they form a larger parallelogram (say ( ABDC )) which is circumscribed around the given triangle. This larger parallelogram is divided into four smaller parallelograms. Let's denote these smaller parallelograms as: - (P_1) - (P_2) - (P_3) - (P_4) 4. Given the mutual arrangement of the parallelograms, we see that diagonals of the individual smaller parallelograms intersect. By the properties of parallelograms, specifically that the diagonals bisect each other, we note that any two diagonals from different smaller parallelograms will intersect at a single point inside each parallelogram. 5. When we consider the main triangle formed, the diagonals (let's denote them as ( d_1 ), ( d_2 ), and ( d_3 )) that are not sides of the triangle intersect at a common point ( M ). This intersection property is due to the parallelogram's diagonals' bisecting nature. 6. The intersection point ( M ) lies on the circumscribing circle of the triangle with vertices being the midpoints of the sides of the triangle. This is because the diagonals of a parallelogram forming are such that each diagonal splits the vertex angles into equal parts thus ensuring the vertex relationship maintained in the larger circumscribing construction. 7. So, the geometric locus of the intersection point ( M ) of the diagonals should be a circle that passes through the midpoints of the sides of the original triangle. 8.

If all switches were in the off position at the beginning, how many lights are switched on by the end of this operation?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine which lights are turned on by X and Y's actions. Since all lights start in the off position, a light will only be on if its switch is flipped an odd number of times. X flips every seventh switch, so he flips the switches for lights 7, 14, 21, and so on up to the highest multiple of 7 that is less than or equal to 200. To find out how many times X flips a switch, we divide 200 by 7: 200 ÷ 7 = 28 with a remainder (we only care about the whole number for the count of switches X will flip). So, X flips 28 switches. Y flips every eleventh switch, so she flips the switches for lights 11, 22, 33, and so on up to the highest multiple of 11 that is less than or equal to 200. To find out how many times Y flips a switch, we divide 200 by 11: 200 ÷ 11 = 18 with a remainder. So, Y flips 18 switches. However, some lights may be flipped by both X and Y if they are multiples of both 7 and 11. To find these lights, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 7 and 11, which is 77 (since 7 and 11 are both prime numbers, their LCM is just their product). Now, we need to find out how many multiples of 77 are there up to 200. We divide 200 by 77: 200 ÷ 77 = 2 with a remainder. So, there are 2 lights that are flipped by both X and Y (at positions 77 and 154). Now, let's calculate the total number of lights that are on: - Lights flipped by X: 28 - Lights flipped by Y: 18 - Lights flipped by both X and Y: 2 Since the lights flipped by both X and Y are flipped twice, they will end up in the off position. We need to subtract these from the total count of lights flipped by X and Y: Total lights on = Lights flipped by X + Lights flipped by Y - Lights flipped by both X and Y Total lights on = 28 + 18 - 2 Total lights on = 46 - 2 Total lights on = 44 Therefore, by the end of the operation, boxed{44} lights are switched on."},{"prompt":"The owner of a small store divided the sugar into 12 packs.

The constraints are ( frac{1}{2} n < k leq frac{2}{3} n ). 2. **Claim:** The least number ( m ) of pawns required is ( 4(n - k) ). 3. **Constructing the Configuration:** - Start by placing a pawn in the first row in the ( n - k )-th column. - Move one square down and right, placing another pawn, and continue this until reaching the ( k - 1 )-th column. - This ensures that each row has at least ( k - 1 ) squares to the right and left of the pawn, satisfying the condition. 4. **Continuing the Pattern:** - After reaching the ( k - 1 )-th column, place pawns diagonally as before but also place a pawn to the left of each, ensuring there are exactly ( k - 1 ) squares between them. - Continue this pattern until reaching the edge of the board, which will be at the ( k )-th column. 5. **Repeating the Pattern:** - The second diagonal starts at row ( 2k - n + 1 ) and continues until row ( n ). - By adding another pawn to continue the diagonal, we reach row ( n - k ), allowing us to repeat the initial pattern. 6. **Verification:** - The configuration satisfies the condition for columns as well, since rotating the board ( 90^circ ) clockwise and reflecting over its horizontal line of symmetry maintains the pattern. 7. **Proving the Pattern Completes Twice:** - Suppose we can't complete the pattern twice: [ k + 2k - n > n implies k > frac{2n}{3} ] This contradicts ( k leq frac{2}{3} n ). - Suppose we can complete the pattern more than twice: [ 2k > n implies k > frac{n}{2} ] This contradicts ( frac{1}{2} n < k ). 8. **Calculating the Number of Pawns:** - During each pattern, there is one pawn per row in the first part and two pawns per row in the second part. - Thus, the total number of pawns is: [ m = 2(2k - n) + 2(n - 2k + n) = 4(n - k) ] 9. **Proving the Lower Bound:** - Consider a configuration with the minimum number of pawns. - Define ( N ) as a set of ( n ) pairs representing the row and column of pawns, ensuring no row appears more than once. - Define \\"good\\" numbers as those in ( [n - k, k - 1] ) and \\"bad\\" numbers otherwise. - Let ( n_1 ) be pairs of two bad numbers, ( n_2 ) be pairs of one good and one bad number, and ( n_3 ) be pairs of two good numbers. - We have: [ n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = n ] Since there are ( 2k - n ) good numbers, ( n_3 leq 2k - n ). [ n_2 = 2(2k - n - n_3) ] [ n_1 = n - n_2 - n_3 = 3n - 4k + n_3 ] - For each pair of two bad numbers, there are two pawns in a row, and for each pair of two good numbers, there is one pawn in that row. - Thus: [ 2n_1 + 2 frac{n_2}{2} + n_3 = m implies 4(n - k) + n_3 = m ] Since ( n_3 geq 0 ), this proves the lower bound.

Find all possible numbers of tangent segments when he stops drawing.","completion":"We want to determine the total number of tangent segments s that can be drawn between 2017 mutually external circles under the given conditions. Step 1: Understanding the Configuration and Counting Segments for a Specific Case - Consider an arrangement of n circles C_1, C_2, ldots, C_n where the centers are aligned, and each circle is eclipsed by its neighboring circles. - In this arrangement, we only need to consider adjacent circles C_i and C_{i+1}. Between each pair of adjacent circles, exactly three tangents can be drawn. Therefore, for n circles: [ s = 3(n-1). ] This gives us the count of tangent segments for one specific configuration. Step 2: Generalizing to an Arbitrary Arrangement - For a general arrangement without restrictions on positions of the circles, we start from the final configuration where no more tangent segments can be drawn and use a continuous process of resizing and moving circles. - We need to show that moving circles around does not change the number of tangent segments drawn. Step 3: Transitions and Tangent Segments - A transition (change in the number of tangent segments) happens when a circle becomes tangent or ceases to be tangent in a way involving three circles being simultaneously tangent to a common line. - Because of this property, once we reach a configuration where no more segments can be drawn, the total number of segments must remain consistent with our initial specific case where we calculated 3(n-1) segments. Step 4: Using Graph Theory and Euler's Formula - We model the circles and tangents as a graph G where circles are vertices, and tangent segments are the edges. - An internal region bounded by tangents will consist of three sharp corners as there are exactly three tangents forming each such region. - Each circle touches exactly three tangent lines, and hence defines vertices in a connected plane (multi-)graph. - According to Euler's formula for a connected planar graph, [ v - e + f = 2, ] where v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces (including the outer face). - Setting v = n (the number of circles), and calculating the faces in terms of sharp corners: [ 2s = 3f. ] Step 5: Solving the Equations - Relate the number of segments s, the number of regions r, and the total circles n using Euler’s formula and the sharp corner argument: [ e = s = 3(n-1), ] [ f = 2s / 3, ] [ v - e + f = 2. ] - Substituting and solving for number of segments, [ n - 3(n-1) + frac{2s}{3} = 2, ] [ n - 3n + 3 + 2n - frac{2}{3} = 2, ] Simplify, [ -2n + frac{2s}{3} = 2. ] Conclusion: - Solving for s: [ 2s = 3 times (2017 - 1), ] [ s = 3 times 2017 - 3 times 1, ] [ s = 3 times 2016, ] [ s = 6048. ] Thus, the only possible number of tangent segments that Luciano can draw is: [ boxed{6048} ]"},{"prompt":") Given a rectangular table of size (4 times 10) (cells).

For this to be true, if a column has an even number of rows (which it does in this case), there must be at least one empty cell in the column (otherwise it would have an even number of crosses). - This implies that in each of the 10 columns, there should be at least one empty cell.

Recall that the grid is now 5 times 10, totaling 5 times 10 = 50 cells. - For each row to contain an odd number of crosses, the sum of crosses in all rows must be odd because the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd. Similarly, for each column to contain an odd number of crosses, the sum of crosses in all columns must also be odd. This implies: [ text{Sum of crosses} = text{odd} ] - However, if we count the total number of crosses based on columns, the sum must be even because there are 10 columns, and the sum of ten odd numbers is even: [ text{Sum of crosses} = text{even} ] - These two conditions are contradictory (the sum cannot be both odd and even simultaneously).

Since k leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 5, k can be expressed as 5n + 2, where n is a non-negative integer.

Now, let's calculate how much money each person will make from selling their stuffed animals: Barbara will make 9 * 2 = 18 from selling her stuffed animals. Trish will make 18 * 1.50 = 27 from selling her stuffed animals. Sam will make 14 * 2.50 = 35 from selling his stuffed animals. Linda will make 7 * 3 = 21 from selling her stuffed animals. The total amount collected from selling all the stuffed animals is: 18 (Barbara) + 27 (Trish) + 35 (Sam) + 21 (Linda) = 101 They managed to secure a 10% discount on the total amount collected, so the discount amount is: 10% of 101 = 0.10 * 101 = 10.10 After applying the discount, the amount they will donate to their class funds is: 101 - 10.10 = 90.90 Therefore, they will donate boxed{90.90} to their class funds."},{"prompt":"Given a circle with diameter [AB], tangents to the circle are drawn at points A and B.

Next, Jess tries to remove another block knocking down the tower. The tower had 28 blocks before Jess's turn. How many players are there in the game?","completion":"Let's calculate the number of blocks removed before the tower fell. In the first 5 rounds, each player removes one block. So, the total number of blocks removed in the first 5 rounds is equal to the number of players times 5. In the sixth round, Jess's father removes one block before Jess, so that's one additional block removed. The tower started with 54 blocks and had 28 blocks left before Jess's turn in the sixth round. So, the number of blocks removed is: 54 (initial blocks) - 28 (remaining blocks) = 26 blocks removed Now, we know that 26 blocks were removed and that includes the 5 rounds plus Jess's father's turn in the sixth round. Let's denote the number of players as P. So, the equation is: 5P + 1 (Jess's father's turn) = 26 Now, we solve for P: 5P = 26 - 1 5P = 25 P = 25 / 5 P = 5 Therefore, there are boxed{5} players in the game, including Jess and her father."},{"prompt":"Suppose that x is a positive multiple of 4.

Therefore, Machine P takes T + 10 hours to produce the same number of sprockets. Since Machine A produces 4.000000000000005 sprockets per hour, let's round this to 4 sprockets per hour for simplicity, as the additional decimal places do not significantly affect the calculation. Now, let's find the production rate of Machine Q. Since Machine Q produces 440 sprockets in T hours, its production rate is: Rate of Machine Q = 440 sprockets / T hours We know that Machine P takes 10 hours longer than Machine Q to produce 440 sprockets, so the production rate of Machine P is: Rate of Machine P = 440 sprockets / (T + 10) hours Since both machines produce the same number of sprockets, we can set their production equal to each other to find the relationship between their production rates: 440 sprockets / T hours = 440 sprockets / (T + 10) hours This equation simplifies to: 1 / T = 1 / (T + 10) However, this equation does not hold because the rates of the two machines are not equal; Machine P takes longer. We need additional information to solve for T or the production rate of Machine Q. Without the specific time it takes for Machine Q to produce the 440 sprockets, we cannot determine the exact production rate of Machine Q or the percentage increase in production rate compared to Machine A.

These four circles are mutually tangent but do not intersect at any point. Determine the radius of the smallest circle that can contain all five given circles. 1. **Initial Setup and Definitions:** Let O be the center of the central circle with radius ( r ). Let ( O_1, O_2, O_3, ) and ( O_4 ) be the centers of the four mutually tangent circles, each also with radius ( r ). 2. **Inspection of Central Circle and the Four Outer Circles:** Clearly, a circle centered at ( O ) with radius 3r contains all five circles. 3. **Contradiction Proof for Smaller Radius:** Assume there exists a point ( O' ) such that a circle centered at ( O' ) with radius less than ( 3r ) can include all five circles. 4. **Analyzing the Sector Involving Two Adjacent Outer Circles:** Consider the sector formed by points ( O_1O_2 ) and ( O ). The angle between the regions formed by any two adjacent circles centered at these points is at least 60^circ, and with four such sectors, the total angle is at most 180^circ. 5. **Case 1: ( O' ) Inside a Sector:** Suppose ( O' ) is an interior point of the sector ( angle O_1 O O_2 ). For O' neq O, there will be some sector where ( O' ) does not overlap with the sector containing ( O ), say ( angle O_2 O O_3 ). 6. **Contradiction in Sector Angle:** - Since the sum of the angles around the circle is 360^circ, the complementary angle sectors not adjacent to ( angle O_1 O_2 ) sum to not more than 180^circ. - Hence ( angle O_4 O O' + angle O_1 O O' geq 180^circ ) implies that one of these angles is at least ( 90^circ ) - Assume ( angle O_1 O O' geq 90^circ ). Then ( O_1 O' ) is the longest side of triangle O_1 O O'. - Since ( O_1 O = 2r ), it follows that ( O_1 O' > 2r ). However, O' O leq 3r - r = 2r, a contradiction. 7. **Case 2: ( O' ) on an Arc:** Suppose ( O' ) lies on the line segment ( O F_2 ) forming part of ( angle O_2 O O_3 ). - If ( angle F_4 O F_2 = 180^circ ), then ( O' F_4 > O F_4 = 3r ). - If ( angle F_4 O F_2 neq 180^circ ) but less than 180°, then ( angle F_4 O O' geq 120^circ ), forming a triangle where ( O_4 O' ) exceeds ( 3r ). 8. **Conclusion:** Both cases lead to contradictions. Therefore, no such ( O' ) exists where a circle of radius less than ( 3r ) centered at ( O' ) can contain all five circles. Thus, the smallest circle that can contain all the given circles has a radius ( 3r ).

However, by congruence of triangles, (AX = XD). - Therefore, (XY leq AX) and a similar argument gives (XY leq AY). 7. **Conclusion about the Angle**: - Since (XY leq AX ) and (XY leq AY), it implies that the segment (XY) can only span a very narrow angle at (A). Hence, (angle XAY < 60^{circ}). Since (angle P'AQ' leq angle XAY), we conclude that (angle P'AQ' < 60^{circ}).

Therefore, bd - ac > 0, and the expression (b + a)(b - a) - (bd - ac) is less than zero because (b + a) is positive, (b - a) is negative, and bd - ac is positive. So we can conclude that frac{b}{a-c} - frac{a}{b-d} = frac{(b + a)(b - a) - (bd - ac)}{(a-c)(b-d)} < 0, which implies that frac{b}{a-c} < frac{a}{b-d}.

So, we can write the equation as: (4/15) * A = (2/5) * B We are given that Bhupathi has Rs. 484, so B = 484. We can substitute this value into the equation to find A: (4/15) * A = (2/5) * 484 To solve for A, we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of (4/15), which is (15/4): A = (15/4) * (2/5) * 484 Now, let's solve for A: A = (15/4) * (2/5) * 484 A = (3/4) * (2/1) * 484 A = (3/2) * 484 A = 1.5 * 484 A = 726 So, Abhinav has Rs. 726.

The difference a - b represents a positive number with a value between 0 and 2, as the minimum value for a - b occurs when a is slightly greater than -1 and b is slightly less than -3, i.e., a - b > -1 - (-3) = 2, and the maximum occurs when a is slightly less than -1 and b is slightly greater than -3, i.e., a - b > -3 - (-3) = 0.

Since they are walking towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds, which is 4 feet per second (Jack) + 5 feet per second (Christina) = 9 feet per second. The distance between them is 270 feet, so the time it takes for them to meet is the distance divided by their relative speed: Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 270 feet / 9 feet per second = 30 seconds.

How will the density of vapor in the bubbles of the boiling liquid change? a) increase b) decrease c) remain unchanged d) decrease first, then increase","completion":"1. **Understanding the problem:** When salt is added to water, the boiling point of the water increases. We need to determine how this change affects the density of the vapor within the boiling bubbles. 2. **Boiling Point Elevation:** When salt (a non-volatile solute) is dissolved in water, it causes the boiling point of the water to increase due to the phenomenon known as boiling point elevation. According to Raoult's law and colligative properties, the addition of solute (salt) results in a higher boiling point for the solution compared to the pure solvent (water). 3. **Composition of the Vapor:** The vapor that forms during the boiling of saltwater (a solution) is primarily water vapor. Salt (as a non-volatile solute) does not evaporate into the vapor phase. 4. **Effect on Vapor Pressure:** At the new elevated boiling point, the vapor pressure of the solution equals the external atmospheric pressure. For the same external pressure, the temperature of the vapor is higher than it was for pure water. 5. **Density of the Vapor:** The density rho of an ideal gas is given by the equation: [ rho = frac{pM}{RT} ] where: - ( p ) is the pressure, - ( M ) is the molar mass, - ( R ) is the universal gas constant, - ( T ) is the absolute temperature. For a given pressure ( p ) and a constant ( M ), the density of the vapor is inversely proportional to temperature ( T ). 6. **Comparative Analysis:** Since the boiling point of saltwater is higher, the temperature of the vapor bubbles in the boiling saltwater will be higher than that in pure water. Since the density is inversely proportional to temperature, a higher temperature will result in a lower density of the vapor: [ rho_{text{saltwater vapor}} < rho_{text{pure water vapor}} ] 7. **Conclusion:** When the water is salted, the temperature increases making the vapor less dense. Therefore, the density of the vapor in the bubbles of boiling saltwater will decrease. [ boxed{б} ]"},{"prompt":"The time on a digital clock is 5:55.

On Day 3, the reed grows to 3 + frac{3}{2} + frac{3}{4} feet, and so on. Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, the total height of the reed after n days is 3(1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} + dots + frac{1}{2^{n-1}}), which simplifies to 3(1 - frac{1}{2^n})/(1 - frac{1}{2}) = 6(1 - frac{1}{2^n}). Similarly, for the smilax, which doubles its growth each day but starts at a height of 1 foot, we have: On Day 1, the smilax is 1 foot tall. On Day 2, the smilax grows to 1 + 2 cdot 1 feet. On Day 3, the smilax grows to 1 + 2 cdot 1 + 2^2 cdot 1 feet, and so on.

For the first wheel with radius r1, after 1500 revolutions, the distance covered (D1) is: D1 = 2πr1 * 1500 For the second wheel with radius r2, it completes N times more revolutions than the first wheel.

First, we can use the sum-to-product identities for sine: [ sin alpha + sin beta = 2 sin left(frac{alpha + beta}{2}right) cos left(frac{alpha - beta}{2}right) ] on the left-hand side. Similarly, using the double-angle identity on the right-hand side, we have: [ 2 sin (alpha + beta) = 2 cdot 2 sin left(frac{alpha + beta}{2}right) cos left(frac{alpha + beta}{2}right) ] Thus, the given equation can be rewritten as: [ 2 sin left(frac{alpha + beta}{2}right) cos left(frac{alpha - beta}{2}right) = 4 sin left(frac{alpha + beta}{2}right) cos left(frac{alpha + beta}{2}right) ] Since (alpha + beta neq 2pi n), it follows that (sin left(frac{alpha + beta}{2}right) neq 0).

For b=log_{frac{1}{4}}10, we can rewrite this as b=-log_{4}10. This is because changing the base from a fraction (frac{1}{4}) to its reciprocal (4) flips the sign of the logarithm. 3. For c=log_{2}frac{1}{3}, we can rewrite this as c=-log_{2}3 for the same reason as a; taking the log of a reciprocal is equivalent to multiplying the log by -1. Now, we compare these values by converting them to a common base or comparing their values directly: - We know that log_{4}10 is greater than log_{4}9 because 10 > 9. Since log_{4}9 = 2log_{4}3 = log_{2}3, we have established that log_{4}10 > log_{2}3. - We also know that log_{2}3 > 1 because 2^1 < 3. - Finally, we compare log_{3}2 with 1.

When we consider the negative signs in front of each logarithm (from our rewritten forms of a, b, and c), this inequality chain flips: -log_{4}10 < -log_{2}3 < -1 < -log_{3}2, which translates to b < c < a.

Proven necessity: First, let's prove that if the lines AA_1, BB_1, and CC_1 intersect at a single point M, then R^* = 1, which implies R = 1 by problem II.43. 3. Application of the Sine Rule: Consider triangle triangle AMC. By the sine rule, we have: [ frac{sin angle ACC_1}{sin angle A_1AC} = frac{|AM|}{|MC|} ] 4. Similarly, apply the sine rule to triangles triangle AMB and triangle BMC. Multiplying these ratios will give us the necessary expression to prove the given condition. 5.

[Solution] Given that one asymptote of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{9} = 1 is 3x - 2y = 0, we can derive the value of a as follows: We have frac{3}{2} = frac{3}{a}, which implies a = 2. Given |PF_1| = 3, we can use the definition of a hyperbola to find |PF_2|. The difference between the distances from any point on the hyperbola to the foci is constant and equal to the length of the transverse axis, which is 2a = 2 cdot 2 = 4 in this case. So, big||PF_2| - 3big| = 4. Solving for |PF_2|, we get |PF_2| = 7. Therefore, the answer is boxed{7}."},{"prompt":"Several identical paintings were purchased for 104 rubles.

Case b: ( p = 10^9 + 9 ) 1. **Similar Setup:** - The same initial reasoning and setup apply. We need to analyze the quadratic equation: [ b_{n+1} equiv 1 (bmod p) Leftrightarrow b_n^2 - b_n + 1 equiv 0 (bmod p) ] - We again check if (-3) is a quadratic residue modulo ( p = 10^9 + 9 ). 2. **Quadratic Reciprocity:** - For ( p = 10^9 + 9 equiv 1 (bmod 4) ), (-1) is a quadratic residue, implying ( -4 equiv 1 (bmod p)), which is a quadratic residue. **Conclusion**: - There exists a solution to the quadratic equation, implying ( b_n ) can take the value ( 1 ) modulo ( p ), potentially allowing Abigaëlle to reach a multiple of ( p ). - Thus, for ( p = 10^9 + 9 ), Tristan's method cannot always prevent Abigaëlle from winning. # Final Conclusion: - For ( p = 10^9 + 7 ): ( boxed{text{Tristan can always win}} ) - For ( p = 10^9 + 9 ): ( boxed{text{Abigaëlle has a winning strategy}} )"},{"prompt":"A man's speed with the current is 21 km/hr and the speed of the current is unknown.

Given that 10alpha is an integer, compute 10alpha . *Proposed by Yannick Yao*","completion":"1. **Define Variables and Initial Setup:** Let ( u = 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2} ) and let ( alpha = frac{x}{10} ) where ( x ) is an integer. We need to find ( 10alpha ). 2. **Angle Transformation:** Let ( A_n ) be the angle ( angle PM_iN_j ) where ( M_i ) and ( N_j ) are the furthest points on the ( n )-th elongation. Observe that if on the ( n )-th elongation, we did an ( M )-elongation, then: [ A_n = frac{A_{n-1}}{2} ] Otherwise, [ A_n = u + frac{A_{n-1}}{2} ] 3. **General Form of ( A_n ):** This implies that after 5 elongations, ( A_n ) will be in the form of: [ A_n = u left( frac{1}{2^5} + frac{a_1}{2^4} + frac{a_2}{2^3} + frac{a_3}{2^2} + frac{a_4}{2} + a_5 right) ] where ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5 in {0, 1} ). Let ( t = 2^4a_5 + 2^3a_4 + 2^2a_3 + 2a_2 + a_1 ), then: [ A_n = frac{u}{32} (2t + 1) ] Notice that ( t ) is written in binary so ( 0 leq t leq 31 ). 4. **Isosceles Triangle Condition:** Since ( M_kN_{5-k}P ) is an isosceles triangle, we have a few cases to consider. 5. **Case 1: ( angle P ) is the Vertex:** This implies that: [ frac{u}{32} (2t+1) = u ] which is obviously not true since ( frac{u}{32} (2t+1) neq u ) for any ( t ). 6. **Case 2: ( PM_0 ) is the Base of the Triangle:** Thus, ( angle M ) and ( alpha ) are both base angles. This implies that: [ frac{u}{32}(2t+1) = alpha ] Substituting ( u = 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2} ) and ( alpha = frac{x}{10} ): [ (2t+1)u = 32 alpha ] [ (2t+1) left( 90^circ - frac{alpha}{2} right) = 32 alpha ] [ (2t+1) left( 90 - frac{x}{20} right) = frac{16x}{5} ] [ (2t+1) (1800 - x) = 64x ] 7. **Solving for ( x ):** Simplifying the equation: [ 3600t + 1800 - x(2t+1) = 64x ] [ 3600t + 1800 = x(2t + 65) ] [ x = frac{3600t + 1800}{2t + 65} ] We need ( x ) to be an integer. Testing values of ( t ) from 0 to 31, we find that ( t = 11 ) works: [ x = frac{3600 cdot 11 + 1800}{2 cdot 11 + 65} = frac{39600}{150} = 264 ] The final answer is ( boxed{264} )."},{"prompt":"A box contains triangular and pentagonal tiles totaling 30 tiles.

Then, knowing that θ is an angle in the second quadrant, we use the basic relationships between trigonometric functions of the same angle to find the values of sin θ and cos θ, which allows us to find the value of sin θ+cos θ. **Solution** Given: tan (θ+ dfrac{π}{4})= dfrac{tan θ+1}{1-tan θ}= dfrac{1}{2}, Therefore, tan θ=- dfrac{1}{3}, and cos^2θ= dfrac{cos^2θ}{sin^2θ+cos^2θ}= dfrac{1}{1+tan^2θ}, Since θ is an angle in the second quadrant, we have cos θ=- sqrt{ dfrac{1}{1+tan^2θ}}=- dfrac{3 sqrt{10}}{10}, sin θ= sqrt{1-cos^2θ}= dfrac{ sqrt{10}}{10}, Therefore, sin θ+cos θ= dfrac{ sqrt{10}}{10}- dfrac{3 sqrt{10}}{10}=- dfrac{ sqrt{10}}{5}.

Given that one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola is y=1, we can infer two things: a. Since the asymptote is horizontal, the hyperbola's transverse axis must be parallel to the x-axis. This means that m must be negative (otherwise, the denominator of x^2 would be smaller, making the hyperbola open vertically). b. The y-coordinate of the hyperbola's center is 0 (since the hyperbola is symmetric about the x-axis), and the distance from the center to the asymptote is sqrt{|m|}. Hence, we have frac{m}{sqrt{2m + m}} = 1. 2. Solving the equation frac{m}{sqrt{2m + m}} = 1 for m: First, square both sides to get rid of the square root: frac{m^2}{2m + m} = 1^2, which simplifies to m^2 = 2m + m. Rearranging the terms, we have m^2 - 3m = 0. Factoring, we get m(m - 3) = 0. This gives us two possible solutions: m = 0 and m = 3.

Subtracting 180^{circ} gives 720^{circ} - 180^{circ} = 540^{circ}. - **Equation for the Number of Sides (n):** Let n be the number of sides of the polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by 180^{circ}(n-2). Setting this equal to the given sum of 540^{circ}, we have: [ 180^{circ}(n-2) = 540^{circ} ] Solving for n: [ n-2 = frac{540^{circ}}{180^{circ}} = 3 ] [ n = 3 + 2 = 5 ] Therefore, the number of sides of this polygon is boxed{5}, and the sum of the interior angles, as given, is boxed{540^{circ}}."},{"prompt":"a certain boys camp, a certain percentage of the total boys are from school A and 30% of those study science.

First, consider the scenario without the restriction that each box must contain at least one ball. In this case, each ball has 4 choices of boxes, so there are 4^5 ways in total.

For any given box to be empty, there are 3^5 arrangements (since the 5 balls can then only go into the remaining 3 boxes). Since there are 4 boxes, this gives us 4 times 3^5 arrangements to subtract. 2. However, this subtraction also removes the cases where 2 boxes are empty twice, so we need to add those back in.

We want to find the percentage of full-time associates who have been at the firm for more than three years. First, let's find out the percentage of part-time associates who have been at the firm for more than two years: Half of the part-time associates (which is 10% of all associates) have been there for more than two years, so: 0.5 * 10% = 5% Now, let's find out the percentage of associates who are full-time: 100% - 10% (part-time) = 90% (full-time) Since 60% are not first-year associates, this includes second-year, third-year, and those who have been there for more than three years. We need to subtract the second-year and third-year associates to find those who have been there for more than three years: 60% (not first-year) - 30% (second-year) - 20% (third-year) = 10% (more than three years) However, this 10% includes both full-time and part-time associates who have been there for more than three years. We already know that 5% of the part-time associates have been there for more than two years, but we don't know how many of them have been there for more than three years specifically. Since the question asks for full-time associates who have been there for more than three years, we can ignore the part-time associates for this calculation.

To verify that every natural number solution ((x, y)) can be represented in the form (x + y sqrt{d} = (x_1 + y_1 sqrt{d})^n ) for some natural number (n): Assume a contradiction: Suppose there exists a natural number solution ((x, y)) which cannot be expressed in this form. Then there exists a natural number (n) such that: [ (x_1 + y_1 sqrt{d})^n < x + y sqrt{d} < (x_1 + y_1 sqrt{d})^{n+1} ] After multiplying by ((x_1 + y_1 sqrt{d})^{-n} = x_n - y_n sqrt{d}), we get: [ 1 < (x + y sqrt{d})(x_n - y_n sqrt{d}) < x_1 + y_1 sqrt{d} ] Define ( (x + y sqrt{d})(x_n - y_n sqrt{d}) = X + Y sqrt{d} ). To reach a contradiction, it suffices to show that (X^2 - d Y^2 = 1) and (X > 0, Y > 0). 8. By the condition: [ (x + y sqrt{d})(x - y sqrt{d}) = 1 text{ and } (x_n + y_n sqrt{d})(x_n - y_n sqrt{d}) = 1 ] Thus, ((X + Y sqrt{d})(X - Y sqrt{d}) = 1), or (X^2 - d Y^2 = 1). Also, [ X + Y sqrt{d} > 1 implies 0 < X - Y sqrt{d} < 1 ] Therefore, [ begin{aligned} 2X &= (X + Y sqrt{d}) + (X - Y sqrt{d}) > 1 + 0 > 0 2Y sqrt{d} &= (X + Y sqrt{d}) - (X - Y sqrt{d}) > 1 - 1 = 0 end{aligned} ] Hence, both (X > 0) and (Y > 0). 9.

Let n be the smallest such positive integer and let (x_0, y_0) be an integer solution. 2. **GCD condition for (x_0, y_0):** We can assume without loss of generality that gcd(x_0, y_0) = 1.

For each number in the sequence, write down how many times it appeared in that sequence. Construct a new sequence similarly from the resulting sequence and so on. Prove that at some step, we will obtain the same sequence twice in a row. 1. **Initial Consideration**: The finite sequence has a limited number of unique integers. Let's denote the original sequence as a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n. 2. **Transformation Process**: For each element a_i in the sequence, we replace a_i with the number of times it appears in the sequence. Let this transformed sequence be b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n. We repeat this transformation process iteratively to generate a series of sequences. 3. **Bounded Nature of Sequences**: Notice that the transformed sequence b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n will always consist of integers that are less than or equal to n, the length of the original sequence. Thus, the maximum possible values of any element in the transformed sequence are bounded by n. 4. **Non-increasing Sequence**: Starting from the third transformation, each number in the sequence cannot exceed the number written under it the previous time. Mathematically: [ t_{i}^{(k)} leq t_{i}^{(k-1)} ] where t_i^{(k)} denotes the i-th element of the sequence at step k. 5. **Eventual Stability to Constant Sequence**: Since we're dealing with a finite set of integers within a finite sequence length, this non-increasing nature will result in the sequence eventually becoming constant. That is, after a sufficient number of iterations, the elements of the sequence will no longer change from one step to the next. 6. **Repetition of Sequences**: Considering the constant nature, if a sequence stabilizes, it means that the transformation of that stable sequence will produce the same sequence again. Since the transformation rules are deterministic and the sequence length is finite, it implies that at some point t_m, the sequence has to repeat, i.e., t_m = t_{m+1}. 7. **Conclusion**: Consequently, based on the above steps, there must be some step t_m where the sequence stabilizes and remains the same in the subsequent transformation: [ boxed{t_m = t_{m+1}} ] Therefore, using the properties of bounded sequences, non-increasing sequences, and the deterministic nature of transformations, we prove the required result that the sequence will eventually repeat."},{"prompt":"From 5 cards numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, one card is randomly drawn, replaced, and then another card is randomly drawn.

Hence, [ 243 k^5 b + 3 equiv 0 + 3 equiv 3 pmod{9} ] 5. However, if (a^5 b + 3) is a perfect cube, and perfect cubes are congruent to ( 0, 1, ) or ( 8 pmod{9}). Clearly, (3 pmod{9}) cannot be a perfect cube. 6. This contradiction shows that there cannot be any integer ( a ) and ( b ) where ( 3 mid ab). Case 2: (3 nmid a b) 1. Assume (3 nmid a) and (3 nmid b), which implies neither (a) nor (b) is divisible by (3). 2. Consider (a^5 b + 3) is a perfect cube, then [ a^5 b + 3 equiv 0, 1, text{ or } 8 pmod{9} ] since cubes modulo (9) are (0, 1, 8 pmod{9}). 3. This tells us (a^5 b equiv -3 pmod{9}), which suggests: [ a^5 b equiv 6 pmod{9} text{ - cube case} ] 4. Similarly, for (a b^5 + 3), [ a b^5 + 3 equiv 0, 1, text{ or } 8 pmod{9} ] hence, (a b^5 equiv -3 pmod{9}) implies: [ a b^5 equiv 6 pmod{9} ] For both conditions to hold, we explore feasible values under modulo operations. Combining Solutions 1. Due to Euler's Theorem, if ( a ) and ( b ) satisfy ( 3 nmid a ) and ( 3 nmid b ), then the order 6 element should be resulted back to one as ( (ab)^6 equiv 1 pmod{9}) But via contradiction: a.

To approach this, we can use the theorem on complete uniformity (additivity). **Step 2: Proof through Induction and Generalization** Base Case: Consider n=p, where p is a prime number. Using the Pigeonhole Principle: Assume we have 2p+1 integers. According to the Pigeonhole Principle, when divided by p, these integers must have at least p+1 elements having the same remainder because the number of different possible remainders when divided by p is p (i.e., 0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1). **Step 3: Contradictory Assumption and General Combinatorics Approach** # Contradiction Method 1. Assume there exist 2p+1 integers (x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{2p+1}) such that no group of p integers has a sum which is a multiple of p. 2. Consider combinations of p elements from the set of 2p+1. The number of ways to choose p elements from 2p+1 elements is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{2p+1}{p} ] 3.

This existence ensures the presence of such a combination among any group of (2p+1) integers.

Let ( m = lfloor 2x rfloor ) and ( n = lfloor 5x rfloor ). By the definition of the floor function, these equalities are equivalent to the conditions that ( 2x - 1 < m leq 2x ) and ( 5x - 1 < n leq 5x ) for some ( x ). Also, since ( 2x < 5x ) for ( x > 0 ), we have ( m leq n ). 2. We need (frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{m} + frac{1}{n}). Clearly, ( b, n, m ) are all nonzero, else the equation is not defined. So we can multiply both sides by ( bmn ), to obtain: [ frac{mn}{m+n} = b ] as an equivalent equation. So the problem becomes finding all integers ( b ) that can be written as ( frac{mn}{m+n} ) for some integers ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( 2x - 1 < m leq 2x ) and ( 5x - 1 < n leq 5x ) for some real ( x ). 3. The inequality ( 2x - 1 < m leq 2x ) is equivalent to ( m leq 2x < m + 1 ). Multiplying this inequality by ( frac{5}{2} ), we find: [ frac{5}{2} m leq 5x < frac{5}{2} m + frac{5}{2} ] From this and the bound on ( n ), we see: [ frac{5}{2} m - 1 < n < frac{5}{2} m + frac{5}{2} quad text{(1)} ] 4. Let ( gcd(m, n) = g ), and let ( m' = frac{m}{g}, n' = frac{n}{g} ), so ( b = frac{g^2 m' n'}{g(m' + n')} = frac{g m' n'}{m' + n'} ). Since ( b ) is an integer, this means ( m' + n' mid g m' n' ). Since ( gcd(m', n') = 1 ), we have ( gcd(m', m' + n') = gcd(n', m' + n') = gcd(m' n', m' + n') = 1 ), so ( m' + n' mid g ). Let ( g' = frac{g}{m' + n'} ), which is an integer. Simplifying our expression for ( b ), we find: [ b = g' m' n' ] which is always an integer. So ( b ) can be any value ( g' m' n' ), if and only if ( g', m', n' ) are integers and: [ frac{5}{2} (m' + n') g' m' - 1 < (m' + n') g' n' < frac{5}{2} (m' + n') g' m' + frac{5}{2} quad text{(2)} ] where inequality (2) above is a result of plugging in our expressions for ( m ), ( n ), and then ( g ) into inequality (1). 5. Now we consider possible values of ( m' + n' ). Since ( m' ) and ( n' ) are positive integers, ( m' + n' geq 2 ). If ( m' + n' = 2 ), then ( m' = n' = 1 ), so ( m = n ). Then from the left part of (1), we have ( frac{5}{2} m - 1 < m ), so ( m < frac{2}{3} ), impossible for ( m ) a positive integer. 6. So ( m' + n' geq 3 ). If ( m' + n' = 3 ), then since ( m leq n ) and thus ( m' leq n' ), ( m' = 1 ) and ( n' = 2 ), so ( n = 2m ). Again using the left part of (1), we have ( frac{5}{2} m - 1 < 2m ), which gives ( m < 2 ), so ( m = 1 ). Then ( g = frac{m}{m'} = 1 ), but ( 3 = m' + n' mid g ), implying ( g geq 3 ), contradiction. So ( m' + n' geq 4 ). 7. If ( m' + n' = 4 ), then since ( gcd(m', n') = 1 ), and ( m' leq n' ), we have ( m' = 1 ) and ( n' = 3 ), so ( n = 3m ). Using the right side of (1), we then have ( 3m < frac{5}{2} m + frac{5}{2} ), which gives ( m < 5 ), so ( m leq 4 ). Since ( 4 = m' + n' mid g ) and ( g mid m ), we have ( 4 mid m ), so ( m = 4 ). Then ( n = 3m = 12 ). This would give: [ b = frac{(4)(12)}{4 + 12} = 3 ] and since setting ( x ) to, for example, ( 2.4 ) does indeed give the desired ( m ) and ( n ), we see that ( b = 3 ) is indeed a possible value for ( b ). 8. Otherwise, there are no other cases for ( m' + n' = 4 ), so ( g' (m' + n') geq m' + n' geq 5 ), and ( frac{1}{g' (m' + n')} leq frac{1}{5} ). So dividing inequality (2) by ( g' (m' + n') ), we find that: [ frac{5}{2} m' - frac{1}{5} leq frac{5}{2} m' - frac{1}{g' (m' + n')} < n' < frac{5}{2} m' + frac{5}{2 g' (m' + n')} leq frac{5}{2} m' + frac{1}{2} ] We just need to use ( frac{5}{2} m' - frac{1}{5} < n' < frac{5}{2} m' + frac{1}{2} ). If ( m' ) is odd, then let ( m' = 2j + 1 ), so that ( 5j + frac{23}{10} < n' < 5j + 3 ). Clearly, there’s no integer in this allowed interval for ( n' ) since ( j ) is an integer, so there can be no solutions when ( m' ) is odd. 9. So ( m' ) is even. Let ( m' = 2k ), so that ( 5k - frac{1}{5} < n' < 5k + frac{1}{2} ). The only integer in this allowed interval for ( n' ) is ( 5k ), so ( n' = frac{5}{2} m' ), where ( m' ) is even. Then since ( gcd(m', n') = 1 ), we have ( m' = 2 ) and ( n' = 5 ), so ( m = m' g = 2g ), and ( n = n' g = 5g ). These conditions, being derived completely from our given conditions, are necessary (for the case that we’re working on, i.e. ( m' + n' ne 4 )), so now we just need to make sure that any positive integer value of ( g ) suffices. But if we want ( lfloor 2x rfloor = m = 2g ), ( lfloor 5x rfloor = n = 5g ), we can simply take ( x = g ), giving: [ frac{1}{b} = frac{1}{2g} + frac{1}{5g} ] so: [ b = frac{(2g)(5g)}{7g} = 10g ] where ( g ) is any positive integer. So when ( m' + n' > 4 ), the possible values for ( b ) are any positive multiples of ( 10 ). 10. Combining all our cases, we see that the only possible values for ( b ) are ( boxed{3 text{ and all positive multiples of } 10} ), which can be obtained by taking, for example, ( x = 2.4 ) and ( x = g ) for any positive integer ( g )."},{"prompt":"triangle triangle ABC, given a=2, b=sqrt{2}, c=sqrt{3}+1, solve this triangle.","completion":"To solve the triangle triangle ABC with sides a=2, b=sqrt{2}, c=sqrt{3}+1, we apply trigonometric formulas. **Step 1: Find Angle A using the Cosine Rule** We apply the cosine rule for angle A: [ cos A = frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc} ] Substituting the given values: [ cos A = frac{sqrt{2}^2 + (sqrt{3}+1)^2 - 2^2}{2 times sqrt{2} times (sqrt{3}+1)} ] Simplifying: [ cos A = frac{2 + 3 + 2sqrt{3} + 1 - 4}{2sqrt{2} times (sqrt{3} + 1)} = frac{2sqrt{3} + 2}{2sqrt{2}(sqrt{3} + 1)} ] Further simplification gives: [ cos A = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} ] Thus: [ A = frac{pi}{4} ] **Step 2: Find Angle B using the Sine Rule** Using the sine rule to find angle B: [ frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} ] Substituting a = 2, A = frac{pi}{4}, and b = sqrt{2}: [ frac{2}{sin frac{pi}{4}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{sin B} ] Since sin frac{pi}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, the equation becomes: [ frac{2}{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{sin B} ] Solving for sin B yields: [ sin B = frac{1}{2} ] Given that b < a, it follows that B < A, hence: [ B = frac{pi}{6} ] **Step 3: Find Angle C** Since the sum of angles in a triangle is pi radians: [ C = pi - A - B = pi - frac{pi}{4} - frac{pi}{6} ] Simplifying: [ C = frac{12pi}{12} - frac{3pi}{12} - frac{2pi}{12} = frac{7pi}{12} ] **Conclusion:** The angles of triangle ABC are A = frac{pi}{4}, B = frac{pi}{6}, and C = frac{7pi}{12}.

This implies that A, the amplitude of the sine function, must be 2. Hence, A=2. - **Condition ②**: The graph of f(x) is obtained by shifting y=sqrt{2}sin(x-frac{pi}{4}) along the x-axis. This condition suggests a certain phase shift and amplitude, but it contradicts with condition ① because the maximum value here would be sqrt{2}, not 2. - **Condition ③**: The distance between adjacent axes of symmetry is frac{pi}{2}. This means the period T of f(x) must be pi because the sine function has symmetrical properties around every frac{T}{2}. Since the period T of a sine function is given by T=frac{2pi}{omega}, we find omega=2. Therefore, combining these insights, we get the function f(x)=2sin(2x+frac{pi}{6}). Considering x in [0,frac{pi}{4}], the argument of the sine function 2x+frac{pi}{6} varies within [frac{pi}{6},frac{2pi}{3}]. Since the sine function increases in this interval, sin(2x+frac{pi}{6}) varies from sin(frac{pi}{6})=frac{1}{2} to sin(frac{2pi}{3})=frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Therefore, f(x)=2sin(2x+frac{pi}{6}) varies from 2timesfrac{1}{2}=1 to 2timesfrac{sqrt{3}}{2}=sqrt{3}. Thus, the range of f(x) on [0,frac{pi}{4}] is boxed{[1,sqrt{3}]}. **(2)** To find the sum of all solutions of the equation f(x)+1=0 on the interval [-pi,pi], we solve 2sin(2x+frac{pi}{6})+1=0, leading to sin(2x+frac{pi}{6})=-frac{1}{2}.

Since the train travels at a rate of 20 miles per hour and the distance is the same, we have: Time on train = 1.5 miles / 20 mph = 0.075 hours Again, we convert this time into minutes: Time on train in minutes = 0.075 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 4.5 minutes Now, we know that walking takes 15 more minutes than riding the train, including the additional x minutes spent walking to the station, waiting, and walking from the station to work.

Thus, the average can be represented as: frac{5 + (-1) + (-2) + x}{4} = 1 To find the value of x, we perform the following steps: Step 1: Simplify the sum in the numerator. frac{5 - 1 - 2 + x}{4} = frac{2 + x}{4} = 1 Step 2: Multiply both sides by 4 to remove the denominator. 2 + x = 4 Step 3: Subtract 2 from both sides to solve for x. x = 4 - 2 x = 2 Step 4: Thus, the value of x is boxed{2}."},{"prompt":"Laura needs to replace the filter in her air purifier every 7 months.

Next, to find out which month it will be 168 months from January, we calculate the remainder when 168 is divided by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year): [ 168 div 12 = 14 text{ (quotient) with a remainder of } 0 ] This implies that 168 months from January brings us back to January, but 14 years later.

Applying the AM-GM inequality: [ u = x^2 + 3y^2 ge 2sqrt{x^2 cdot 3y^2} = 2sqrt{3}xy, ] so xy le frac{u}{2sqrt{3}}. Express xy = ku, where k le frac{1}{2sqrt{3}}. Then from the equation x^2 - 2xy + 3y^2 = 9: [ u(1 - 2k) = 9, ] thus u = frac{9}{1-2k} and [ x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2 = u(1 + 2k) = 9 cdot frac{1 + 2k}{1 - 2k}. ] This function increases as k increases. The maximum of k is frac{1}{2sqrt{3}}, so the maximum value of the expression is: [ 9 cdot frac{1 + frac{1}{sqrt{3}}}{1 - frac{1}{sqrt{3}}} = 9 cdot frac{1 + frac{sqrt{3}}{3}}{1 - frac{sqrt{3}}{3}} = 9 cdot frac{3 + sqrt{3}}{3 - sqrt{3}} cdot frac{3 + sqrt{3}}{3 + sqrt{3}} = 27 + 9sqrt{3}. ] The expression simplifies to frac{108 + 36sqrt{3}}{6} = 18 + 6sqrt{3}.

According to the problem, we have |x| > 0, which leads to x neq 0. Therefore, the domain of the function f(x) is (-infty, 0) cup (0, +infty). f(-sqrt{2}) = log_{2}|- sqrt{2}| = log_{2}2^{frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{2}. So, the domain of f(x) is (-infty, 0) cup (0, +infty), and f(-sqrt{2}) = boxed{frac{1}{2}}. 2. Let x in (-infty, 0) cup (0, +infty), then -x in (-infty, 0) cup (0, +infty). f(-x) = log_{2}|-x| = log_{2}|x| = f(x), Therefore, f(-x) = f(x).
