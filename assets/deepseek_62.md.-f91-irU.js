This implies: [ f(x) = a(x-p)(x-q)(x-r) - 3 ] for some integer coefficient ( a ). 3. **Evaluate at the fourth prime**: To find ( f(s) ), we evaluate the polynomial at ( x = s ): [ f(s) = a(s-p)(s-q)(s-r) - 3 ] Since ( f(s) ) must also be either ( 3 ) or ( -3 ), we analyze: [ a(s-p)(s-q)(s-r) - 3 = 3 quad text{or} quad a(s-p)(s-q)(s-r) - 3 = -3 ] 4. **Case: f(s) = 3**: [ a(s-p)(s-q)(s-r) - 3 = 3 implies a(s-p)(s-q)(s-r) = 6 ] Analyze parity: - If ( s ) is odd, then ( s, p, q, r ) are all odd, and therefore ( s-p, s-q, s-r ) are even. This would make ( (s-p)(s-q)(s-r) ) divisible by 8. Since ( 6 ) is not divisible by ( 8 ), ( s ) must be even. - Therefore, ( s = 2 ). 5. **Evaluate ( f(2) )**: [ f(2) = a(2-p)(2-q)(2-r) - 3 ] Since ( p, q, r ) are odd, ( 2-p, 2-q, 2-r ) are even, and thus the product ( (2-p)(2-q)(2-r) ) is even. Also note: [ |(2-p)(2-q)(2-r)| geq 1 cdot 3 cdot 5 > 6 ] Thereby, ( a |(2-p)(2-q)(2-r)| ) exceeds 6, creating a contradiction. Thus, ( f ) cannot take the value ( -3 ) at three primes. 6. **Symmetric Argument**: If we assumed ( f(x) = 3 ) for three distinct primes, a similar argument would lead to a contradiction. 7. **Distribute (pm 3) among four primes**: Therefore, ( f(x) ) must take the values ( 3 ) and ( -3 ) at two of the primes: - Let ( f(p) = f(q) = 3 ) and ( f(r) = f(s) = -3 ) - Analyze ( f(x) - 3 ) and ( f(x) + 3 ): [ f(x) = a(x-p)(x-q)(x-r) - 3 = b(x-p)(x-q)(x-s) + 3 ] Given ( p, q, r, s ) are distinct primes, following arguments on parity and the structure of polynomials demonstrate contradictions similarly. 8. **Final Contradiction**: If three primes ( p, q, r ) are odd, then both products of odd integers are odd, leading to contradictions since required values imply an impossible configuration for a product equating ( pm 6 ).

Now, we need to find out how many non-union employees are women. First, let's find out how many men are non-unionized: - We know there are 46 men in total and 42 of them are unionized, so there are 46 - 42 = 4 non-unionized men. Next, let's find out the total number of non-union employees: - If 60% are unionized, then 100% - 60% = 40% are non-unionized. - So, there are 0.40 * 100 = 40 non-union employees. Now, we can find out how many of these non-union employees are women: - We know there are 4 non-unionized men, so the rest of the non-union employees must be women. - Therefore, there are 40 (non-union employees) - 4 (non-union men) = 36 non-union women. Finally, to find the percentage of non-union employees who are women: - (Number of non-union women / Total number of non-union employees) * 100 - (36 / 40) * 100 = 0.9 * 100 = 90% So, boxed{90%} of the non-union employees are women."},{"prompt":"Express 3.overline{136} as a common fraction in lowest terms.","completion":"Let ( x = 3.overline{136} ).

The problem statement discusses the angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle, where the measure of the angle is given by the formula: [ theta = frac{alpha + beta}{2} ] where alpha and beta are the arcs intercepted by the sides of the angle. We need to consider if the central angle is a special case of this scenario when the chords are diameters. 2. Let's consider the central angle theta_c formed by two radii of the circle, which subtend an arc alpha. In this scenario, both intercepted arcs are equal since they are symmetric with respect to the circle's center. Thus, alpha = beta. 3. Substituting into the given formula for the angle: [ theta_c = frac{alpha + alpha}{2} = frac{2alpha}{2} = alpha ] 4. The theory of the angle formed by two intersecting chords relies on the central angle theorem, which states that the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc.

This is essentially the defining property of an isosceles triangle. Therefore, statement (A) is **true**. 2. **Analyzing Statement (B):** Convex geometry entails that any line segment joining two points inside the figure lies entirely within the figure and each interior angle is less than 180 degrees. Isosceles triangles, by their nature, have no angles greater than 180 degrees. Therefore, statement (B) is **true**. 3. **Analyzing Statement (C):** In an isosceles triangle, two sides are of equal length, and hence, by the Isosceles Triangle Theorem, the angles opposite these sides are also equal. Therefore, statement (C) is **true**. 4. **Analyzing Statement (D):** By the definition of convex shapes, all interior angles in a convex polygon are less than 180 degrees; this applies to any convex polygon regardless of the number of sides.

This implies that, some colors may have more or fewer points to ensure the total sum is 2006. There will be at least two colors having their points summing up to a minimum of: [ 2 cdot 118 = 236. ] 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: We will now use induction to show that through any (2k-1) points of two colors, we can always draw (k-1) non-overlapping chords with endpoints of the same color. **Base Case**: - For (k=1), there are (2k-1=1) point which trivially supports (0) chords. - For (k=2), there are (2k-1=3) points and hence (1) chord, as it's the simplest scenario. 3. **Induction Step**: Assume that the hypothesis holds for (k), i.e., through (2k-1) points, we can draw (k-1) non-overlapping chords with endpoints of the same color. Now for (k+1), consider (2(k+1)-1 = 2k+1) points of two colors. We can find at least two adjacent points of the same color among the (2k+1) points (since there are two colors involved and one must repeat consecutively given the total). Connect these two adjacent points with a chord, denote this chord (CH), and then remove these two points from the set.

We start by considering the query: \\"Is there a planar quadrilateral where the tangents of all its internal angles are equal?\\" Initially, it might seem that the answer is negative because the only quadrilateral with all equal angles is a rectangle. However, the tangent function is periodic and does not imply equality of angles but rather a specific relationship among the angles. 2. Let's explore this relationship. Recall that if tantheta = tanphi, then it must be that theta and phi differ by an integer multiple of pi: [ theta = phi + kpi quad text{for some integer } k. ] 3. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding a quadrilateral where each pair of angles has their difference as an integer multiple of pi. 4. Let's consider a quadrilateral with angles alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. They must sum up to 2pi: [ alpha + beta + gamma + delta = 2pi. ] 5. Suppose alpha, beta, and gamma are all equal and delta differs from them by pi. We set alpha = beta = gamma = 45^circ and delta = 360^circ - 3 times 45^circ = 225^circ. The sum of the angles indeed equals 360^circ: [ 45^circ + 45^circ + 45^circ + 225^circ = 360^circ. ] 6. Checking the tangents of all angles: [ tan 45^circ = 1, ] [ tan 225^circ = tan(180^circ + 45^circ) = tan 45^circ = 1. ] Hence, all tangents are equal to 1. 7.

For m geqslant 4, we analyze the possibility of rearranging {a_{n}} into a geometric sequence {b_{n}}. We conclude that it's not possible for {a_{n}} to all be positive or all be negative, as this would imply {a_{n}} itself is a geometric sequence, which contradicts our findings in part (1). Considering the absolute values {|b_{n}|} and analyzing the conditions under which they could form a geometric sequence, we find that it's not possible for m geqslant 4 due to the constraints on the sequence's terms and their relationships.

We need to prove that the number of pieces on the black squares is even. I. Solution: 1. Consider the properties of the chessboard. Note that if we swap two columns or two rows, the parity of the number of pieces in any row or column remains unchanged. 2. Renumber the rows and columns for convenience. Let the rows be denoted by (s_1, s_2, ldots, s_8) and the columns by (o_1, o_2, ldots, o_8). 3. Reorder the rows as (s_1, s_3, s_5, s_7, s_2, s_4, s_6, s_8) and the columns as (o_1, o_3, o_5, o_7, o_2, o_4, o_6, o_8). 4. With this rearrangement, the board is divided into four (4 times 4) blocks, with two opposite blocks consisting entirely of black squares and the other two consisting entirely of white squares. 5. Consider one (4 times 8) rectangle with rows (s_1, s_3, s_5, s_7). Since each row contains an odd number of pieces, the total number of pieces in this rectangle is even. 6. Apply this to the other (4 times 8) rectangle to conclude that the number of pieces in the black and white (4 times 4) blocks have the same parity. 7. By extending this argument to the entire board, the parity of the number of black pieces will be the same in each opposite (4 times 4) block and must add up to an even number. 8. Thus, the total number of pieces on black squares is even. II. Solution: 1. Notice that since each row contains an odd number of pieces, the total number of pieces on the board is even (the sum of eight odd numbers is even). 2. Recall the property that a cell is black if the sum of its row and column indices is odd. Conversely, it is white if the sum is even. 3. Construct the sum by considering even-numbered rows and columns: [ S = sum_{i text{ even}} sum_{j text{ even}} a_{ij} + sum_{i text{ even}} sum_{j text{ odd}} a_{ij} + sum_{i text{ odd}} sum_{j text{ even}} a_{ij} + sum_{i text{ odd}} sum_{j text{ odd}} a_{ij} ] Where (a_{ij}) indicates the presence of a piece at ((i,j)). 4. Note that the terms in (S) fall under the following cases: - Twice counted cells where row and column indices are even contribute an even number. - Cells where either row or column index is even contribute black cells that were counted once. - The total count (S) is even since it sums eight odd terms. 5. Therefore, for the sum (S) to remain even, the parity must be preserved implying the number of black pieces is even. III. Solution: 1. Start with a base case where pieces are placed only on the main diagonal (one per row and column). Here, there are no pieces on black squares (0, an even number). 2. To generate another valid configuration, changing the state (placing or removing) of pieces must be done in such a way that the parity of every row and column will still balance to an odd number. 3. Altering the configuration by considering rectangles to maintain parity. 4. Any such transformation will alter the number of pieces on black and white squares in pairs, preserving their even parity. Conclusively, the initial setup and allowed transformations maintain even parity for the number of pieces on black squares.

So we can set up the following equation: 5000 + (5000 - d) + (5000 - 2d) + (5000 - 3d) + (5000 - 4d) = 15000 Combining like terms, we get: 5000 + 5000 + 5000 - d - 2d - 3d - 4d = 15000 15000 - 10d = 15000 Subtract 15000 from both sides to solve for d: -10d = 15000 - 15000 -10d = 0 Since -10d equals 0, it means that d must be 0. However, this cannot be correct because we know there is a fixed interval between the prizes. It seems we made a mistake in our equation.

To determine if the condition is necessary, we assume that a, b, c do indeed form a geometric progression.

Consequently, the condition b^2 = ac is necessary for a, b, c to form a geometric progression. 2. To determine if the condition is sufficient, we start with the assumption b^2 = ac, given a, b, c in mathbb{R} and b < 0. Since this implies a, b, c neq 0, we can theoretically take square roots of both sides, yielding sqrt{b^2} = sqrt{ac}. However, because b < 0, we must consider the negative square root: -b = sqrt{ac}. This implies that the elements can be part of a geometric progression with a negative common ratio. Since no additional conditions are specified, the existence of a common ratio confirms that a, b, c can form a geometric progression. Hence, the condition b^2 = ac is also sufficient for a, b, c to form a geometric progression.

Step 1: Understanding Pick's Theorem Pick's theorem states that the area ( A ) of a lattice polygon can be determined by the formula: [ A = I + frac{B}{2} - 1 ] where ( I ) is the number of interior lattice points and ( B ) is the number of boundary lattice points. Step 2: Expressing Expected Area as a Sum We need to compute the expected area of our convex hull. By linearity of expectation, we can write: [ A = -1 + sum_{p in {1,2,ldots,6}^2} mathbb{E}[X_p] ] Here, ( X_p ) is defined as follows based on the position of the point ( p ): - ( X_p = 1 ) if ( p ) is inside the polygon, - ( X_p = frac{1}{2} ) if ( p ) is on the boundary, - ( X_p = 0 ) otherwise. Step 3: Simplifying Using Symmetry and Estimations By symmetry, we can condense the sum by recognizing the periodic pattern of the lattice points. The expected value ( f(p) = mathbb{E}[X_p] ) can then be approximated with simpler specific cases: [ A = -1 + 4 f(1,1) + 8 f(1,2) + 8 f(1,3) + 4 f(2,2) + 8 f(2,3) + 4 f(3,3) ] Step 4: Estimating ( f(p) ) - For ( f(1,1) ): The point ( (1,1) ) is on the boundary if it is selected. This occurs with probability: [ f(1,1) = frac{1}{12} ] - For ( f(3,3) ): The central point ( (3,3) ) is very likely to be inside the polygon: [ f(3,3) approx 1 ] - For ( f(1,y) ) where ( y in {2,3} ): The point ( (1,y) ) is on the boundary if it or other points aligned or around it are selected. Estimating this, considering selection happens with probability: [ f(1,2) approx f(1,3) approx frac{1}{8} ] - For ( f(2,2) ) and ( f(2,3) ): These values can be approximated by examining the intermediate positions possibly being boundary points due to the vicinity of selections: [ f(2,2) approx frac{1}{4},quad f(2,3) approx frac{1}{2} ] Step 5: Summing Up Substituting our approximations into our original equation: [ A approx -1 + 4 left(frac{1}{12}right) + 8 left(frac{1}{8}right) + 8 left(frac{1}{8}right) + 4 left(frac{1}{4}right) + 8 left(frac{1}{2}right) + 4 (1) ] Let's compute each term: [ 4 left(frac{1}{12}right) = frac{1}{3}, quad 8 left(frac{1}{8}right) = 1, quad 8 left(frac{1}{8}right) = 1 ] [ 4 left(frac{1}{4}right) = 1, quad 8 left(frac{1}{2}right) = 4, quad 4 (1) = 4 ] Summing these up: [ A approx -1 + frac{1}{3} + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = -1 + 11.333 approx 10.455 ] # Conclusion: To find ( N ): [ N = leftlfloor 10^4 cdot 10.4552776 rightrfloor = 104552 ] Therefore, the final answer is: [ boxed{104552} ]"},{"prompt":"a musical performance, four friends — Sarah, Jess, Rachel, and Lucy — performed as quartets in different combinations, where one friend was absent in each set.

Express your answer as a common fraction.","completion":"First, we need to calculate the total time of the first few songs played and check if it's possible to hear the entire favorite song in different scenarios: 1. **Length of each song**: The shortest song is 40 seconds and each subsequent song is 40 seconds longer than the previous. Hence, the lengths are 40s, 80s, 120s, ..., 480s. 2. **Find the rank of Maria's favorite song**: The favorite song is 4 minutes and 40 seconds long, which is 280 seconds. This corresponds to the sequence 40s, 80s, ..., 480s. The song 280 seconds long is the 7th song. 3. **Calculate the possible scenarios**: - If the first song is 40 seconds, the total time with the second song (80 seconds) would be 120 seconds, which isn't enough to play the favorite song completely. - If the first song is 80 seconds, the total time with the second song (120 seconds) would be 200 seconds, still not enough. - Continue with this method until the total time surpasses 280 seconds. We find that if the first song is 160s (or longer), the next song cannot be Maria's favorite (since she would have already exceeded the 280-second mark of her favorite song).

Given the structure of the plant, we can understand that there is one main stem, a certain number of branches equal to x, and then each of these branches grows x small branches.

The equation representing the total count is: [1 + x + x^2 = 57] This equation simplifies to: [x^2 + x + 1 = 57] Subtracting 57 from both sides to set the equation to 0, we get: [x^2 + x - 56 = 0] Solving this quadratic equation, we look for values of x that satisfy it. The solutions to the equation are found by factoring or using the quadratic formula.

Define: [ U_{x, y} = sum_{i=x}^{y} u_i quad text{and} quad V_{x, y} = sum_{i=x}^{y} v_i ] For any integer (k), let (overline{k}) be the unique integer such that (overline{k} in {1, 2, dotsc, q - 1}) and (k equiv overline{k} pmod{q - 1}). 7. **Express the product:** We have: [ prod_{i=1}^{w(q-1)+2} left( d(p + a_i q) right) = d^{w(q-1)+2} r^{U_{1, w(q-1)+2}} s^{V_{1, w(q-1)+2}} prod_{i=1}^{w(q-1)+2} frac{p + a_i q}{r^{u_i} s^{v_i}} ] This can be rewritten as: [ T_0 times T_1 times T_2 ] where: [ T_0 = d^{w(q-1)} r^{U_{1, w(q-1)+2} - overline{U_{1, (w-1)(q-1)+1}} - overline{U_{(w-1)(q-1)+2, w(q-1)+2}}} s^{V_{1, w(q-1)+2} - overline{V_{1, (w-1)(q-1)+1}} - overline{V_{(w-1)(q-1)+2, w(q-1)+2}}} ] [ T_1 = d r^{overline{U_{1, (w-1)(q-1)+1}}} s^{overline{V_{1, (w-1)(q-1)+1}}} prod_{k=1}^{(w-1)(q-1)+1} frac{p + a_i q}{r^{u_i} s^{v_i}} ] [ T_2 = d r^{overline{U_{(w-1)(q-1)+2, w(q-1)+2}}} s^{overline{V_{(w-1)(q-1)+2, w(q-1)+2}}} prod_{k=(w-1)(q-1)+2}^{w(q-1)+2} frac{p + a_i q}{r^{u_i} s^{v_i}} ] 8. **Analyze (T_1) and (T_2):** Note that for (j in {1, 2}), (T_j / d equiv p pmod{q}), implying (T_j in S). Moreover, (nu_r(T_j / d) leq q - 1) and (nu_s(T_j / d) leq q - 1). Both inequalities imply that (T_j) can be factored into at most: [ M := max left{ 1 + frac{q - 1}{u}, 1 + frac{q - 1}{v} right} ] irreducible terms. 9. **Analyze (T_0):** It is easy to see that (nu_r(T_0), nu_s(T_0) geq 0) and (nu_r(T_0), nu_s(T_0) equiv 0 pmod{q - 1}). So, we multiply all the power of (r) and also (d_0^{w(q-1)}) to (T_1) and multiply all the power of (s) to (T_2). We get that (T_1 / d, T_2 / d) remain constant modulo (q) and also maintain (nu_s(T_1 / d), nu_r(T_2 / d) leq q - 1). 10. **Conclusion:** Thus, we have proved that we can factor (prod_{i=1}^{w(q-1)+2} left( d(p + a_i q) right)) into at most (2M) irreducible terms. Adding the remaining (z) terms, we conclude that we can factor (d(p + nq)) into at most (q - 1 + 2M) terms. Hence, for any (d(p + nq) in S) that can be factored into (N > 2q) terms, there exists a factorization that uses only (q - 1 + 2M) terms. Therefore, (t = max { 2q, q - 1 + 2M }) works, and we are done.

Any ticket with at least one cell matching the winning permutation wins a prize. How many tickets are needed to be sure of winning a prize?","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to determine the minimum number of lottery tickets required to ensure that at least one ticket matches the winning permutation in at least one cell. The tickets are permutations of the numbers (1, 2, 3, ldots, 50). 2. **Constructing a Winning Strategy:** We start by considering the construction of 26 tickets. Each ticket will have the last 24 numbers fixed as (27, 28, ldots, 50). The first 26 numbers will be cyclic shifts of the sequence ([1, 2, ldots, 26]). This ensures that for any position (i) from 1 to 26, there is a ticket where the number (i) appears in the (i)-th position. 3. **Verification of the Strategy:** To verify that 26 tickets are sufficient, consider the following: - For each position (i) from 1 to 26, there is exactly one ticket where the number (i) appears in the (i)-th position. - For positions 27 to 50, the numbers (27, 28, ldots, 50) are fixed and do not change across the tickets. - Therefore, any winning permutation will match at least one of these 26 tickets in at least one position. 4. **Proving 25 Tickets are Insufficient:** Suppose, for contradiction, that 25 tickets are sufficient to guarantee a win. For each position (i) from 1 to 50, let (S_i) be the set of numbers that never appear in the (i)-th position in any of the 25 tickets. Clearly, (|S_i| geq 25) because each number can appear at most once in each position across the 25 tickets. 5. **Lemma and Proof:** - **Lemma:** For any subset (S) of ([50]), (|cup_{e in S} S_e| geq |S|). - **Proof:** If (|S| leq 25), this is trivial because (|S_e| geq 25) for all (e in [50]). If (|S| = t > 25), since every number (i) can appear at most 25 times (once per ticket), there must exist some (f in S) so that (i in S_f). Otherwise, (f) would appear at least (t) times. This implies that (|cup_{e in S} S_e| = 50), proving the lemma. 6. **Application of Hall's Marriage Theorem:** Consider a bipartite graph where one set of vertices is ([50]) and the other set is also ([50]). There is an edge from vertex (i) to vertex (j) if (j in S_i). By the lemma, this graph satisfies Hall's condition, implying there is a perfect matching. This perfect matching corresponds to a ticket that guarantees a loss, contradicting the assumption that 25 tickets are sufficient. 7. **Conclusion:** Since 25 tickets are insufficient and 26 tickets are sufficient, the minimum number of tickets required to guarantee a win is 26.

The inequality ln x lt 1 can be rewritten using the property of logarithms to find the range of x. We know that ln x lt 1 implies e^{ln x} lt e^1, which simplifies to x lt e.

After a 25% reduction, the new price per kg becomes 75% of P, which is given as Rs. 60.

Let's denote the amount of money she spends at the reduced price as M. At the reduced price, she gets 5 kgs more oil for the same amount of money. So, if she gets X kgs of oil at the original price, she gets X + 5 kgs at the reduced price. We can write the equation for the amount of money spent at the original price and the reduced price as follows: M = X * P (at the original price) M = (X + 5) * (0.75 * P) (at the reduced price) Since P is Rs. 80, we can substitute that into the second equation: M = (X + 5) * (0.75 * Rs. 80) We know that the reduced price per kg is Rs. 60, so we can also write: M = (X + 5) * Rs. 60 Now we have two expressions for M, so we can set them equal to each other: X * Rs. 80 = (X + 5) * Rs. 60 Now we solve for X: 80X = 60X + 300 Subtract 60X from both sides: 20X = 300 Divide both sides by 20: X = 300 / 20 X = 15 So, originally, the housewife could buy 15 kgs of oil.

Roll the smaller circle such that ( OQ ) makes an angle (alpha ) with ( OB ). Let the point of contact in this position be ( C ). 3. During the rolling, the arc ( CP ) of the smaller circle is equal to the arc ( CB ) of the larger circle because the smaller circle is rolling without slipping. The radius ratio of the larger circle to the smaller circle is 2:1. Therefore, the angle at ( Q ) by the smaller circle, denoted (angle PQC), is ( 2alpha ). 4. Since ( angle POC ) as an inscribed angle is half of the central angle ( angle PQC ), we have that: [ angle POC = frac{1}{2} angle PQC = alpha ] 5. Points ( O, Q ), and ( C ) lie on a straight line because ( C ) is the contact point of both circles.

If any student ends up with three red markers, then the total number of red markers must be a multiple of 3: [ text{Total number of red markers} = 28 ] However, 28 is not divisible by 3 (since ( 28 div 3 = 9.333 )), which means it’s impossible for all 28 red markers to be distributed such that each student gets exactly three red markers. 5. Similar consideration applies to green and blue markers, as each color has 28 markers, and 28 is not divisible by 3. 6. Next, let's consider the scenario of distributing markers by giving initially 27 markers out of 28 to students (disregarding 1 marker to be redistributed): - Distribute 27 red markers among 9 students (3 red markers per student). - Distribute 27 green markers among another set of 9 students (3 green markers per student). - Distribute 27 blue markers among yet another set of 9 students (3 blue markers per student). 7. Now, we have 27 distributed for each color and one marker remaining for each color. Therefore, 1 student is left and needs 3 different markers (one of each color). 8. This means it is inherently impossible for every student in the class to end up with three markers of the same color due to an imbalance in distribution aligned to the constraints. 9. Hence, it can be conclusively stated: [ boxed{text{The students cannot exchange markers so that each ends up with three markers of the same color.}} ]"},{"prompt":"We have two rectangles, where rectangle ABCD has sides overline {AB} of length 5 and overline {CB} of length 6.

This occurs for the term where we have left(frac{1}{x}right)^{3}(-x)^{3}, as the powers of x will cancel out, leaving a constant. The coefficient of this term is given by the binomial coefficient C_{6}^{3}, and the term itself is C_{6}^{3}(frac{1}{x})^{3}(-x)^{3} = C_{6}^{3}(-1)^{3}. Calculating this gives 20(-1) = -20. Therefore, the constant term is -20, not 20. Hence, option A is incorrect. **Option B: The binomial coefficient of the 4th term is the largest** In a binomial expansion of the form (a+b)^{n}, the largest binomial coefficient occurs at the middle term(s). For n=6, the largest binomial coefficient indeed occurs at the 4th term (considering the first term as the 1st term). Therefore, option B is correct. **Option C: The 3rd term is 15x^{2}** To find the 3rd term, we use the general formula for the kth term in a binomial expansion, T_{k} = C_{n}^{k-1}a^{n-(k-1)}b^{k-1}. For the 3rd term, k=3, we have T_{3} = C_{6}^{2}(frac{1}{x})^{6-2}(-x)^{2} = C_{6}^{2}(frac{1}{x})^{4}(-x)^{2}. Calculating this gives 15(frac{1}{x^{2}}), not 15x^{2}.

This solid is generated by rotating a parallelogram around an axis that is perpendicular to one of its diagonals and passes through its end. 2. Let's label the vertices of the parallelogram as ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) with the diagonal ( AC ). 3. Upon rotating segments ( BC ) and ( CD ) around the diagonal ( AC ), we form two truncated cones. The same process occurs for segments ( AB ) and ( AD ), which produce two additional cones. 4. Calculating the surface area of each part: - For the segments creating truncated cones: [ S_{text{truncated cones}} = pi (KB cdot BC + AC cdot BC + MD cdot AD + AC cdot AD) ] - For the segments creating full cones: [ S_{text{full cones}} = pi KB cdot AB + pi MD cdot AD ] 5.

Analyze the game objective: - The player who erases the last letter wins. - Alice needs to ensure that after every move of hers, the count of all letters with each multiplicity is even. 4. Determine Alice's strategy: - To ensure her victory, Alice should aim to initially make all letters with multiplicity of 1 even. - Since Kolya's first move did not affect multiplicity of 1 letters, Alice needs to erase one of these letters to turn its count to zero (an even number). 5. Possible moves for Alice: - Alice can erase letters with multiplicity 1 (G, K, L, M, N, P, R, T, U). For simplicity, suppose Alice chooses to erase \\"G\\". 6. Verify new sequence: - After Alice's move (erasing \\"G\\"), the new phrase is: \\"ОРОДСКАЯ УСТНАЯ ОЛИМПИАД\\". 7. Continue the strategy: - Alice needs to respond directly to Kolya's moves: - For each move Kolya makes, Alice should erase an equal number of letters of the same multiplicity to maintain the counts even. 8. Example scenarios: - If Kolya erases 3 letters \\"A\\", Alice erases 3 letters \\"O\\" (maintaining the count of multiplicity 3 letters even). - If Kolya erases 1 letter \\"D\\", Alice erases 1 letter \\"I\\" (maintaining the count of multiplicity 2 letters even). 9.

Given that the sum of these vectors is zero, the vectors must balance each other out in some manner. 2. **Bounding the angle between vectors**: We want to consider any possible scenario where none of the pairs (z_i) and (z_j) satisfy (|z_i + z_j| < 1). 3. **Transformation to simplify the problem**: Assume, without loss of generality, that (z_1) aligns with the positive real axis. That is, (z_1) lies on the positive direction of the (x)-axis. 4. **Geometric partition based on angle**: Considering complex plane partition, create directional vectors: - Let (OA) and (OB) be lines making (120^circ) angles with (z_1) – specifically (angle xOA = 120^circ) and (angle xOB = 240^circ). By creating these sectors, all of the vectors corresponding to ( z_2, ldots, z_n ) must fall into the sectors formed by (angle xOA) and (angle xOB) because these sectors cover the entire plane except for the (angle xOC), with (OC) making an angle of (240^circ) with the positive real axis. 5. **Applying the zero sum condition**: Since ( z_{1} + z_{2} + cdots + z_{n} = 0 ), the sum of the real parts of (z_2, ldots, z_n) must add up to the negative real part of (z_1). Since ( z_1 ) lies on the positive real axis, its real part is positive, and hence there must be some vectors among ( z_2, ldots, z_n ) with non-positive real parts to cancel out the real component of ( z_1 ). 6. **Contradiction argument**: If we assume the contrary (that there are no such (i) and (j) such that (|z_i + z_j| < 1)), consider the geometric placement again—rotate and transform to position vectors: Suppose all ( z_{2}, ldots, z_{n} ) vectors lie within ( angle xOA ) and ( angle xOB ), with real parts of these vectors thus confined. Given the premise, there is a conflict because none of these configurations could lead to a balancing condition where all vectors sum to zero. Therefore, there must be at least one vector within ( z_{2}, ldots, z_{n} ) that strays into the other sectors, thereby ensuring that (|z_i + z_j| < 1). Thus: 7. **Conclusion**: By contradiction, we confirm that there must exist at least one pair (i, j) such that (1 leq i < j leq n) and (|z_i + z_j| < 1).

We need to prove that the statement also holds for a convex polygon with ( 3n + 3 ) vertices. 3. **Constructing the Polygon:** Consider a polygon with ( 3n + 3 ) vertices.

To find out how many seeds were in the partial bed, we can subtract the number of flowers that grew in the full beds from the total number of flowers: 220 total flowers - (3 full beds * 60 flowers per bed) = 220 - 180 = 40 flowers These 40 flowers came from the partial bed, which means 40 seeds were planted in the partial bed.

This follows from the convexity of ( f ) and the fact that the intervals on the left-hand side are larger, thus the average value of ( f ) over these intervals is greater. 7. **Conclusion:** By the properties of convex functions and Jensen's inequality, the given inequality holds.

This makes the trinomials differ only in their constant terms. 4. **Difference of Quadratic Functions:** By examining any two functions ( f_i(x) ) and ( f_j(x) ), the difference ( f_i(x) - f_j(x) ) will result in a linear equation: [ f_i(x) - f_j(x) = k ] where ( k ) is a non-zero constant because the roots of each quadratic function are different. 5. **Absence of Common Solutions:** For every such linear equation formed by the difference of two quadratics, there will be no integer ( x ) that resolves the equation to zero because ( k ) is non-zero. Hence, no pairs ( (i, j) ) of these quadratic functions will have a common root where ( f_i(x) = f_j(x) ), ensuring no solutions for these intersections. # Conclusion Since differentiating each possible quadratic trinomial pair ( f_i, f_j ) yields no valid integer solutions for ( f_i(x) = f_j(x) ), Vasya will not find any common roots.

This can be done because any move that takes the rook off the diagonal will either move it to the right (to a square like (xi), where (i neq x)) or upward (to a square like (ix), where (i neq x)). - The second player, with their turn, can then move the rook back onto the diagonal by making a horizontal or vertical move back to a square on (a1-h8). 5. **Final Move**: - Since the target square (h8) itself is on this diagonal, and it is a winning position, the first player must move the rook off the diagonal at least once before reaching the target (h8) (if they move correctly, the square (h8) will be vacant during their move when the rook is placed off the diagonal). - Thus, the first player will inevitably leave (h8) open for the second player to place the rook on (h8) on their subsequent turn. 6. **Conclusion**: - By always ensuring the rook is returned to the diagonal (a1-h8) and positioning the rook onto (h8) when available, the second player guarantees a win.

Here phi (n) is the number of numbers k from {1, 2,. . . , n} with gcd (n, k) = 1 .","completion":"To solve the problem, we need to find all pairs ((a, b)) of positive integers such that the equation (a + b = phi(a) + phi(b) + gcd(a, b)) holds. Here, (phi(n)) is Euler's totient function, which counts the number of integers up to (n) that are coprime with (n). 1. **Express (a) and (b) in terms of their greatest common divisor:** Let (d = gcd(a, b)). Then we can write (a = dx) and (b = dy) where (gcd(x, y) = 1). Substituting these into the given equation, we get: [ dx + dy = phi(dx) + phi(dy) + d ] 2. **Use properties of the totient function:** Recall that (phi(dx) = phi(d) cdot phi(x)) when (gcd(d, x) = 1). Since (gcd(x, y) = 1), we have: [ phi(dx) = phi(d) cdot phi(x) quad text{and} quad phi(dy) = phi(d) cdot phi(y) ] Substituting these into the equation, we get: [ dx + dy = phi(d) cdot phi(x) + phi(d) cdot phi(y) + d ] Factoring out (phi(d)), we obtain: [ d(x + y) = phi(d) (phi(x) + phi(y)) + d ] Simplifying, we get: [ d(x + y - 1) = phi(d) (phi(x) + phi(y)) ] 3. **Analyze the equation:** We need to find when the equality (d(x + y - 1) = phi(d) (phi(x) + phi(y))) holds. Consider the following cases: - **Case 1: (d = 1):** If (d = 1), the equation simplifies to: [ x + y - 1 = phi(x) + phi(y) ] Assume (x) and (y) are composite. For composite numbers (x) and (y), (phi(x) leq x - 1) and (phi(y) leq y - 1). This implies: [ x + y - 1 leq (x - 1) + (y - 1) = x + y - 2 ] This is a contradiction unless (x) or (y) is 1. Therefore, (x) and (y) must be either 1 or prime. This gives us the solutions ((1, p)) and ((p, 1)) where (p) is a prime number. - **Case 2: (d neq 1):** If (d neq 1), we need to find when (d(x + y - 1) = phi(d) (phi(x) + phi(y))) holds. Assume (x) and (y) are composite. Then (phi(x) leq x - 1) and (phi(y) leq y - 1). This implies: [ x + y - 1 leq frac{x + y}{2} ] This is a contradiction unless (x = y = 1). Therefore, (x) and (y) must be either 1 or prime. This gives us the solutions ((2^t, 2^t)) where (t geq 1). 4. **Conclusion:** The solutions are ((x, y) in {(2^t, 2^t); (1, p); (p, 1)}), where (t geq 1) and (p) is a prime number.

Given a selected diagonal, there are k vertices on one side of the decagon. How many diagonals are perpendicular to this diagonal and how many are parallel to it? Calculate into how many parts the longest diagonal of the decagon is divided by the diagonals perpendicular to it. Let the length unit be the radius of the circumscribed circle of the decagon.","completion":"1. Consider the regular decagon S_{10} with vertices labeled as A_{0} A_{1} ldots A_{9}. Let A_{i}A_{j} = d (where j > i) be any diagonal of the decagon. The perpendicular bisector f of d passes through the center O of the circumscribed circle k around S_{10}. Therefore, reflecting any point of k across f, maps it to another point on k, with the intersection points of f and k remaining fixed. The line segments connecting paired points on k due to this reflection are perpendicular to f. Since A_{i} and A_{j} are such a pair, reflecting S_{10} across f would also map it onto itself. Consequently, there are further pairs among the 8 remaining vertices of the decagon that are mapped onto each other, forming at least 3 such pairs excluding the sides of S_{10}. Hence, we find at least one diagonal parallel to d. 2. In case the shared points of k and f are actual vertices of S_{10} (1a. figure), the segment between them will form a diagonal perpendicular to d. If f is not a diagonal (1b. figure), it will be a perpendicular bisector of a side of S_{10} (since there is no other axis of symmetry for the decagon). Thus, there will be at least two sides of S_{10} perpendicular to f, and these sides will form a rectangle around O, whose diagonals will be perpendicular to d. This completes the proof of the existence of diagonals that are parallel and perpendicular to any given diagonal d. Figures a and b illustrate these symmetries. 2. From the previous reasoning, f is a diagonal of the decagon if and only if the number of vertices, k, on one side of d is odd (and correspondingly, the count of vertices on the other side will be odd). In such a case, apart from f, there are 8 external vertices forming 4 diagonals parallel to d, yielding 3 diagonals parallel to d. Additionally, since the common perpendicular bisector g of diagonals d will be a side bisector (parallel to d), the 10 vertices form 5 pairs, with 2 pairs being the sides of the decagon. Therefore, the number of diagonals perpendicular to d is also 3 (1a. figure). Similarly, f is a side bisector if k is even. In this scenario, there will be 2 diagonals parallel and 4 perpendicular to d (1b. figure). 3. The most extended diagonal, A_{0} A_{5}, of length 2 units, is divided into 5 parts by the 4 perpendicular diagonals (2. figure), where 2 segments are symmetric and thus equal, and the middle segment equals a side of the decagon a_{10}. From problem 1766, [ B_{2} B_{3} = 2 sin 18^{circ} = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2} = 0.618, ] as O A_{2} A_{3} is an isosceles triangle with an angle of 36° between equal sides. Reflecting across A_{0} A_{5}, the diagonals A_{2} A_{7}, A_{8} A_{3}, A_{1} A_{8}, and A_{9} A_{2} intersect at points on the axis. Using the inscribed angle theorem, the mentioned angles are equal, making the triangles O C A_{2} and C A_{0} A_{1} isosceles, yielding: [ O C = 2 O B_{2} = B_{3} B_{2} = a_{10}. ] Thus, [ B_{1} A_{0} = frac{C A_{0}}{2} = frac{1 - O C}{2} = frac{3 - sqrt{5}}{4} = 0.382. ] Finally, [ B_{2} B_{1} = B_{2} C + C B_{1} = frac{O C}{2} + frac{C A_{0}}{2} = frac{O A_{0}}{2} = frac{1}{2}. ] Remarks: 1. Reflecting diagonal d = A_{i} A_{j} across O often seems straightforward to show the existence of a diagonal parallel to d. For diagonals when d is a diameter, additional justification is needed. 2.

Given that rapprox 0.95, we calculate hat{b} and hat{a} as follows: - First, we find hat{b} using the formula hat{b} = r times sqrt{frac{sum_{i=1}^{n}{{(y_{i}-overline{y})}^{2}}}{sum_{i=1}^{n}{{(x_{i}-overline{x})}^{2}}}}. With the given statistics, we have hat{b} = 0.95 times sqrt{2.304} approx 0.95 times 1.518 approx 1.442. - Next, we calculate hat{a} using hat{a}=overline{y}-hat{b}overline{x}. Given overline{x} = 37.96 and overline{y} = 39.1, we find hat{a} = 39.1 - 1.442 times 37.96 approx -15.56. Thus, the empirical regression equation of y on x is formulated as: hat{y} = 1.44x - 15.56. boxed{hat{y} = 1.44x - 15.56} **(3)** To calculate the residual for the first sample point (32.2, 25.0), we substitute x = 32.2 into the regression equation: - The predicted value of y is hat{y} = 1.44 times 32.2 - 15.56 approx 30.808. - The actual value of y is 25.0, so the residual is 25.0 - 30.808 = -5.808 approx -5.81. As for the effect of excluding this sample point on hat{b}, since the point is below and to the right of the regression line, excluding it would generally shift the regression line slightly upwards for the remaining points, causing an increase in the slope hat{b}.

Let's break down each equality step by step. First Equality: 1. Start with the given integral for the Gaussian distribution: [ frac{1}{sqrt{2pi}} int_{mathbb{R}} e^{-frac{x^2}{2}} , dx = 1 ] 2. Square the integral to facilitate computation: [ left( int_{mathbb{R}} e^{-frac{x^2}{2}} , dx right)^2 = int_{mathbb{R}} e^{-frac{x^2}{2}} , dx int_{mathbb{R}} e^{-frac{y^2}{2}} , dy ] 3. Write the double integral in terms of both (x) and (y): [ left( int_{mathbb{R}} e^{-frac{x^2}{2}} , dx right)^2 = int_{mathbb{R}^2} e^{-frac{x^2}{2}} e^{-frac{y^2}{2}} , dx , dy = int_{mathbb{R}^2} e^{-frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}} , dx , dy ] 4. Switch to polar coordinates, where (x = r cos varphi) and (y = r sin varphi). Hence, (dx , dy) transforms to (r , dr , dvarphi): [ int_{mathbb{R}^2} e^{-frac{x^2 + y^2}{2}} , dx , dy = int_{0}^{2pi} int_{0}^{infty} r e^{-frac{r^2}{2}} , dr , dvarphi ] 5. Solve the inner integral first: [ int_{0}^{infty} r e^{-frac{r^2}{2}} , dr ] 6. Set (u = frac{r^2}{2}), hence (du = r , dr). Change the limits of integration accordingly: [ int_{0}^{infty} e^{-u} , du = 1 ] 7. The integral becomes: [ int_{0}^{2pi} dvarphi cdot 1 = 2 pi ] 8. Thus, we have: [ left( int_{mathbb{R}} e^{-frac{x^2}{2}} , dx right)^2 = 2pi ] 9. Taking the square root yields: [ int_{mathbb{R}} e^{-frac{x^2}{2}} , dx = sqrt{2pi} ] 10. Multiply by the normalization factor (frac{1}{sqrt{2pi}}): [ frac{1}{sqrt{2pi}} int_{mathbb{R}} e^{-frac{x^2}{2}} , dx = 1 ] Second Equality: 1. Consider the given summation for the negative binomial distribution: [ sum_{n=k}^{infty} binom{n-1}{k-1} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = 1 ] 2. Let (q = 1 - p). Rewrite the summation: [ I = sum_{n geq k} binom{n-1}{k-1} p^k q^{n-k} ] 3. Factor out (p^k): [ I = p^k sum_{n geq k} binom{n-1}{k-1} q^{n-k} ] 4. Replace the binomial coefficient and recognize the pattern of a generating function: [ I = p^k cdot q^{-k} sum_{n geq k} binom{n-1}{k-1} q^n ] 5. Notice that: [ sum_{n=k}^infty binom{n-1}{k-1} q^{n} = q^k sum_{n=0}^infty binom{n+k-1}{k-1} q^n ] 6. Recognize that the series is a geometric series with the generating function for ((1-q)^{-k}): [ sum_{n=0}^infty binom{n+k-1}{k-1} q^n = (1-q)^{-k} ] 7. Thus: [ I = p^k q^{-k} (1-q)^{-k} ] 8. Substitute back (q = 1-p): [ I = p^k (1-p)^{-k} (1-(1-p))^{-k} = 1 ] Therefore, both equalities are proven, showing that Gaussian and negative binomial distributions are indeed probability distributions.

We know that the total weight of the bar is 70 kg, so we can write the following equation: T + S = 70 (1) We are also given that 10 kg of tin loses 1.375 kg in water, which means that the apparent loss in weight of tin per kg in water is 1.375 / 10 = 0.1375 kg/kg. Similarly, 5 kg of silver loses 0.375 kg in water, so the apparent loss in weight of silver per kg in water is 0.375 / 5 = 0.075 kg/kg. When the entire bar is submerged in water, it loses 7 kg of its weight. The weight loss in water for the tin and silver in the bar can be represented as: 0.1375T + 0.075S = 7 (2) Now we have a system of two equations with two unknowns (T and S).

Since 0.2 is less than 0.5, we'll round down: Liam's candy count = 109 pieces Finally, let's calculate the total number of pieces of candy collected by all four siblings: Total candy count = Maggie's candy count + Harper's candy count + Neil's candy count + Liam's candy count Total candy count = 50 + 65 + 91 + 109 Total candy count = 315 pieces However, the siblings have been told they can't collect more than a combined total of 300 pieces of Halloween candy. Since the total candy count of 315 pieces exceeds this limit, we need to adjust the count to ensure they don't exceed the 300 pieces limit.

By definition, f(x) = 0. - Notice that f(0) = 0 (since f is a linear map). - Since f is injective, f(x) = f(0) implies x = 0. - Therefore, operatorname{Ker} f = {0}. Thus, if f is injective, then operatorname{Ker} f = {0}. 2. **Converse Statement**: - **Assume** that operatorname{Ker} f = {0}. - We need to show that f is injective. - Let x, y in E be such that f(x) = f(y). We need to show that x = y. - Consider the equation f(x) = f(y). By linearity of f, we have f(x) - f(y) = 0, which implies f(x - y) = 0. - Therefore, x - y in operatorname{Ker} f.

We need to show that operatorname{Im} f = F. - Recall that the image of f, denoted operatorname{Im} f, is defined as { y in F mid exists x in E : f(x) = y }. - Since f is surjective, for every y in F, there exists x in E such that f(x) = y. - Therefore, every y in F is in operatorname{Im} f, i.e., F subseteq operatorname{Im} f. - On the other hand, since operatorname{Im} f is clearly a subset of F by definition, we have operatorname{Im} f subseteq F. - Combining the two inclusions, we get operatorname{Im} f = F. Thus, if f is surjective, then operatorname{Im} f = F. 2. **Converse Statement**: - **Assume** that operatorname{Im} f = F. - We need to show that f is surjective. - By the definition of the image, operatorname{Im} f = { y in F mid exists x in E : f(x) = y }. - Given that operatorname{Im} f = F, it follows directly that for every y in F, there exists x in E such that f(x) = y. - Therefore, by definition, f is surjective.

We need to prove that ( f(a) = a ) for all ( a in mathbb{N} ). 2. **Special Case for Primes:** We first consider the case where ( a ) and ( b ) are primes. Let ( p ) be a prime number. By setting ( b = n ), we have: [ af(a) + nf(n) + 2an text{ is a perfect square.} ] This implies that ( af(a) ) must be a quadratic residue modulo ( n ) for every positive integer ( n ). 3. **Using ISL 2007 N2 Result:** According to the result from ISL 2007 N2, if ( af(a) ) is a quadratic residue for every ( n ), then ( af(a) ) must itself be a perfect square. Therefore, we can write: [ af(a) = k^2 text{ for some integer } k. ] This implies that ( f(a) ) must be of the form ( frac{k^2}{a} ). 4. **Divisibility Condition:** We now claim that ( f(1) = 1 ). To prove this, we need to show that if ( p ) is a prime and ( p mid f(a) ), then ( p mid a ). Assume otherwise. Since ( v_p(a) + v_p(f(a)) equiv 0 pmod{2} ) and ( v_p(a) = 0 ), we have ( v_p(f(a)) equiv 0 pmod{2} ). Let ( v_p(f(a)) = 2k ). 5. **Contradiction Argument:** Taking ( b = p^{2k-1} ), we have: [ af(a) + p^{2k-1}f(p^{2k-1}) + 2ap^{2k-1} text{ is a perfect square.} ] Since ( f(p^{2k-1}) ) is a multiple of ( p ), it follows that: [ v_p(af(a) + p^{2k-1}f(p^{2k-1}) + 2ap^{2k-1}) = 2k-1, ] which is a contradiction because the valuation should be even for a perfect square. Therefore, ( p mid f(a) implies p mid a ), and we conclude that ( f(1) = 1 ). 6. **General Case for Primes:** Taking ( a = p ) and ( b = 1 ), we have: [ pf(p) + 2p + 1 text{ is a perfect square.} ] Therefore, we have: [ pf(p) + 2p + 1 ge (sqrt{pf(p)} + 1)^2 = pf(p) + 2sqrt{pf(p)} + 1, ] which implies: [ f(p) le p. ] Since ( p mid f(p) ), we conclude that ( f(p) = p ). 7. **General Case for All ( a in mathbb{N} ):** Now, take ( b = p ).

Under this inversion, the following properties hold: - Lines through A map to themselves. - Lines not through A map to circles passing through A. - Circles passing through A map to lines not passing through A. 2. **Identify the points and their images under the inversion:** - Point A maps to itself. - Point D on circle C_2 and on the tangent line d_1. Under mathcal{I}_A, D maps to a point D', lying on the image of C_2. - Line d_2 which is parallel to d_1 and tangent to C_1. It intersects C_2 at E and F. Under inversion, d_2 maps to a circle passing through A tangent to C_1 and also intersecting C_2 at points E' and F'. 3. **Symmetry and tangency:** - Due to the symmetry of the figure with respect to the line EF, post-inversion, the image of d_3 (which contains points D and intersects d_2 at points B and C) will be such that left( B'C' right) is parallel to d_1. - As we invert back, the preimage relation holds tangency properties consistent with the symmetric nature of the points involved. 4. **Conclude tangency of circumcircle of triangle ABC with d_1:** - By inversion symmetry and tangency arguments mapped back to the original figure, the circumcircle of triangle ABC becomes tangent to d_1.

So, frac{9}{15} times frac{2}{14} = frac{18}{210} = frac{6}{35}. Thus, the total probability that two segments of the same length are chosen is: [ frac{1}{7} + frac{6}{35} = frac{5}{35} + frac{6}{35} = frac{11}{35} ] So, the probability that the two chosen segments have the same length is boxed{frac{11}{35}}."},{"prompt":"f sqrt{3} sin 20^circ can be written as cos theta sin theta for some acute angle theta, what is theta?

Therefore, the minimum positive period of f(x) is boxed{pi}. 2. **Interval of monotonic increase:** - The function f(x) = 2sin(2x + frac{7pi}{6}) increases in the intervals where 2x + frac{7pi}{6} is in [-frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi, frac{pi}{2} + 2kpi], k in mathbb{Z}. - Solving for x gives x in [-frac{5pi}{6} + kpi, -frac{pi}{3} + kpi], k in mathbb{Z}. - This can also be written as x in [kpi + frac{pi}{6}, kpi + frac{2pi}{3}], k in mathbb{Z}.

Given that the slope of MA exists and is not zero, let the equation of PA be y - sqrt{2} = k(x - 1), which simplifies to y = kx - k + sqrt{2}. Substituting into the equation of the parabola, we get frac{k}{2}y^2 - y - k + 2 = 0. Thus, y_1 + sqrt{2} = frac{4 - 2k}{k}, so y_1 = frac{4 - 2k}{k} - sqrt{2}. Let the equation of PB be y - sqrt{2} = -k(x - 1), which simplifies to y = -kx + k + sqrt{2}. Substituting into the equation of the parabola, we get frac{k}{2}y^2 + y - k - 2 = 0. Thus, y_2 + sqrt{2} = -frac{4 + 2k}{k}, so y_2 = -frac{4 + 2k}{k} - sqrt{2}. Therefore, y_2 - y_1 = -frac{4 + 2k}{k} - sqrt{2} - frac{4 - 2k}{k} + sqrt{2} = -frac{8}{k}. And y_2 + y_1 = 4 - 2sqrt{2}.

Let's label them as follows: - Glass A: contains wine. - Glass B: contains water. 2. **Step-by-Step Transfer Process**: - A drop of wine is taken from Glass A and added to Glass B, followed by thorough mixing. - Next, a drop of the mixture from Glass B is taken and added back to Glass A. 3. **Analysis of Volumes**: - Assume the volume of liquid in each glass does not change after the transfer operations. This means the quantity of liquid in each glass remains constant throughout the process. 4. **Conservation of Volume**: - When the drop of wine is transferred to Glass B, it displaces an equivalent volume of water when mixed. Therefore, when we take a drop from Glass B back to Glass A, the volume taken is identical to the drop added initially in terms of volume. 5. **Equality of Mixtures**: - After these operations, the amount of wine that was originally transferred to Glass B will be equal to the amount of water that came back to Glass A from Glass B. This is because the total volume of liquid remains constant and any mixture proportion remains balanced by volume. 6. **Conclusion**: - The amount of wine in Glass B is equal to the amount of water in Glass A. This happens due to the conservation of liquid volumes and the fact that each transfer balances out the other in terms of volume exchanged. 7. **Multiple Transfers**: - If the transfer process is repeated multiple times (e.g., 10 times), the same principle holds. Each iteration maintains the balance due to volume conservation. Therefore, the results will not change: the amount of wine in Glass B will always equal the amount of water in Glass A. 8. **Effect of Mixing Thoroughness**: - Even if the mixing is not very thorough, as long as the volumes are transferred consistently, the overall conclusion does not change. The wine transferred to Glass B will equate to the water transferred to Glass A by volume. # Final Answer: The amount of wine in the glass with water is equal to the amount of water in the glass with wine. This conclusion holds regardless of the number of transfers or the thoroughness of mixing, as it is primarily governed by volume conservation. boxed{text{Equal}}"},{"prompt":"A person distributed his income among his 4 children, giving 10% to the eldest, 15% to the second, 20% to the third, and 25% to the youngest.

Therefore, the range of a for which f(x) > 0 always holds is boxed{[0, 2e)}. # Part (2) Given a = 1 and frac{f(x_{1})}{sqrt{x_{1}}} = frac{f(x_{2})}{sqrt{x_{2}}} = sqrt{m} with x_{1} < x_{2}, we need to prove that x_{2} - x_{1} < frac{sqrt{m^2 - 16}}{2}. 1. **Function g(x)**: Define g(x) = frac{(2x - ln x)^2}{x}. Its derivative is g'(x) = frac{(2x - ln x)(2x - 2 + ln x)}{x^2}. 2. **Monotonicity of p(x)**: Define p(x) = 2x + ln x - 2. Both y = 2x - 2 and y = ln x are increasing, so p(x) is increasing on (0, +infty), and p(1) = 0. This implies g'(x) < 0 for 0 < x < 1 and g'(x) > 0 for x > 1. 3. **Behavior of g(x)**: Since g(x) is decreasing on (0, 1) and increasing on (1, +infty), we have g(x) geq g(1) = 4. Given g(x_{1}) = g(x_{2}) = m, it follows that m > 4 and 0 < x_{1} < 1 < x_{2}. 4. **Inequality involving g(x) and h(x)**: To prove g(x) geq h(x) = 2(x + frac{1}{x}), we consider varphi(x) = (2x - ln x)^2 - 2x^2 - 2. The derivative varphi'(x) is positive for x > 1 and negative for 0 < x < 1, indicating varphi(x) geq varphi(1) = 0. 5. **Roots of h(x) = m**: Solving h(x) = m gives two roots x_{3} < x_{4}, with x_{4} - x_{3} = frac{sqrt{m^2 - 16}}{2}. Since g(x) geq h(x), it follows that x_{2} - x_{1} < x_{4} - x_{3} = frac{sqrt{m^2 - 16}}{2}, proving the statement. Thus, we have boxed{x_{2} - x_{1} < frac{sqrt{m^2 - 16}}{2}}."},{"prompt":"There are 172 twoway direct airways between 20 cities, at most one between any two cities.

Each edge ( e(u_i, u_j) in E ) indicates a direct airway between cities ( u_i ) and ( u_j ). 2. **Calculate the total number of possible edges:** The total number of possible edges in a complete graph with 20 vertices is given by: [ binom{20}{2} = frac{20 times 19}{2} = 190 ] Since there are 172 edges, the graph is not complete, but it is very close to being complete. 3. **Assume the contrary:** Suppose the statement is not true. Then there exist two cities ( u ) and ( w ) such that one cannot reach ( w ) from ( u ) with at most one transfer. This implies that there is no direct edge between ( u ) and ( w ), and there is no city ( v ) such that both ( u ) and ( w ) are connected to ( v ). 4. **Analyze the degrees of vertices:** Let ( deg(u) ) be the degree of vertex ( u ). Since ( u ) and ( w ) are not directly connected, and there is no intermediary city ( v ) connecting both ( u ) and ( w ), the degrees of ( u ) and ( w ) must be such that: [ deg(u) + deg(w) leq 18 ] because ( u ) and ( w ) cannot share any common neighbors. 5. **Calculate the total number of edges:** If ( u ) and ( w ) are not connected and have no common neighbors, the maximum number of edges in the graph would be: [ binom{20}{2} - 1 = 190 - 1 = 189 ] However, since ( deg(u) + deg(w) leq 18 ), the actual number of edges would be: [ 190 - (20 - 1) = 190 - 19 = 171 ] This is a contradiction because we are given that there are 172 edges. 6. **Conclude the proof:** Since assuming the contrary leads to a contradiction, the original statement must be true.

Therefore, the total cost for x sessions, including the membership card, is y_{1} = 12x + 40. For Scheme 2, the cost per session after the discount is 20 times (1 - 0.2) = 20 times 0.8 = 16 dollars.

First, consider the square. We need to cut the square in such a way that two pieces can be combined to form an octagon. 2. Let's assume the side length of the square is (a). 3. To form an octagon, we can cut the square along one of its diagonals, forming two right-angled triangles with legs (a) and (a) and hypotenuse (asqrt{2}). 4. These two right-angled triangles can then be rearranged to form an octagon by placing the hypotenuse (long side) along the edges of the octagon, aligning the vertices appropriately. Therefore, the pieces are perfectly aligned to form an octagon as required. 5. Next, consider cutting a triangle such that the resulting pieces can form a 20-sided polygon. 6. Let's take an equilateral triangle, for simplicity, having each side length as (L). 7. One way to achieve this would be to use a geometrical approach. Cut the equilateral triangle into smaller congruent isosceles triangles. These cuts will be along lines drawn from one vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. 8.

First, let's examine the numbers in the rows: - The first row: (1) - The second row: (2, 3, 4) - The third row: (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) - The fourth row: (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) 3. Let's determine the sum of the numbers in each row: - For the first row: [ text{Sum} = 1 ] We note that (1 = 1^2). - For the second row: [ text{Sum} = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 ] We note that (9 = 3^2). - For the third row: [ text{Sum} = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 25 ] We note that (25 = 5^2). - For the fourth row: [ text{Sum} = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 49 ] We note that (49 = 7^2). 4. We see a pattern that the sum of numbers in each row is a perfect square, and specifically, it is the square of an odd number. 5. Let us generalize this observation and prove it by mathematical induction. 6. **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), the sum of the first row is ( 1 = 1^2 ), which holds true. 7. **Inductive Step:** Assume that for ( n = k ), the sum of the numbers in the ( k )-th row is ((2k-1)^2). 8. For ( n = k+1 ): - The numbers in the ( (k+1) )-th row are ( k+1, k+2, k+3, ldots, 3k+1 ). - The sum of the arithmetic sequence from ( k+1 ) to ( 3k+1 ) can be calculated as follows: [ text{Sum} = sum_{i=k+1}^{3k+1} i ] - The number of terms in this arithmetic sequence is ( 3k + 1 - (k+1) + 1 = 2k + 1 ). - The sum of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula: [ text{Sum} = frac{n}{2} times (text{First Term} + text{Last Term}) ] Substituting the values: [ text{Sum} = frac{2k + 1}{2} times (k+1 + 3k+1) = frac{2k + 1}{2} times (4k + 2) = (2k + 1)^2 ] 9.

The detailed description is as follows: - The snake starts in an initial position in the grid. - It then moves such that it completes a specific sequence (not fully specified here but described in detail by moving to certain cells). 3. **Detailed movemenet:** - *In Figures 1 to 4:* - The snake shifts into the target position by moving the head of the snake to specific cells while ensuring its body follows the path. - *In Figures 5 and 6:* - The snake continuously deforms its loop, shifting certain \\"bumps\\" (portions of its body) in a specific manner. - This repeated deformation eventually allows the snake to shift all parts of its body appropriately, turning around its position, as shown in Figures 7 through 12. 4. **Generalizing the path:** - By using perturbations and repeating them, the snake moves across the grid and manages to turn around, finally reaching the required position. 5. **Graph Theory-based Solution:** - **Graph construction (stage 1):** - Represents the snake's path using a planar graph G. - Consists of \`r\` main paths each of length \`ell\` and linking paths that connect them in a cycle. - Transit paths link these connecting nodes into a broader cycle. - **Graph transitions:** - Snake moves by advancing along these paths by following specific movements described to ensure the snake turns around. 6. **Embedding the graph into the grid (stage 2):** - *Grid embedding:* - Cells a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{r+1} and b_1, b_2, ldots, b_r are chosen such that H (subgraph) lies in specific columns and rows in the grid. - The main paths nearly fill the rectangles bounded by these cells. - *Linking paths:* - Paths connect these main paths appropriately in each row and column of H. - Special paths for the first and last rows/columns to ensure continuity. - **Snake movement:** - The snake in H can turn around due to the constructed paths linking all the vertices. - Repeating these movements allows the snake to occupy and turn around. 7. **Conclusion:** - After both stages, it is clear that the snake can turn around in the grid. - The length of the snake is frac{r-1}{r}n^2. As r tends to infinity, this ratio approaches 1, meaning the snake's length can be close to n^2. - This satisfies the problem's condition that the snake's length is at least 0.9n^2.

According to the information given, the construction cost of the certain house is C + 100,000. The certain house sells for 1.5 times as much as the other houses.

The profit made on the certain house is the difference between its selling price and its construction cost, which is given as 60,000. Therefore, we can write the following equation: Selling price of the certain house - Construction cost of the certain house = Profit 1.5S - (C + 100,000) = 60,000 Now, we can solve for S: 1.5S - C - 100,000 = 60,000 1.5S = C + 100,000 + 60,000 1.5S = C + 160,000 Since the certain house sells for 1.5 times the price of the other houses, we can substitute 1.5S for the selling price of the certain house in the equation: 1.5S = C + 160,000 Now, we need to express C in terms of S. Since the certain house costs 100,000 more to build than the other houses, we can write: C = S - 100,000 Substituting this into the equation, we get: 1.5S = (S - 100,000) + 160,000 1.5S = S + 60,000 Now, we can solve for S: 1.5S - S = 60,000 0.5S = 60,000 S = 60,000 / 0.5 S = 120,000 Therefore, each of the other houses sells for boxed{120,000} ."},{"prompt":"w many 3digit numbers have the property that the units digit is exactly twice the tens digit?","completion":"Using similar casework based on the choice of the tens digit: [ begin{array}{|c|c|} hline text{Tens digit} & text{Units digit} hline 0 & 0 hline 1 & 2 hline 2 & 4 hline 3 & 6 hline 4 & 8 hline end{array} ] - For each tens digit from 0 to 4, there is exactly one corresponding units digit that is the twice the value of the tens digit. - The hundreds digit can be any of 1,2,dots,9.

The angle bisector, in this case, is a line with a slope equal to the slope of line l, which is y=sqrt{3}x.

We start by recalling an important property of numbers, which is that the product of the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is equal to the product of those two numbers themselves. This can be expressed as: mathop{text{lcm}}[a,b] cdot gcd(a,b) = ab. Given this relationship, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the greatest common divisor (gcd): gcd(a,b) = frac{ab}{mathop{text{lcm}}[a,b]}. Given that a and b are both 6-digit integers, it follows that a < 10^6 and b < 10^6. Therefore, the product of a and b is less than 10^{12}, as we can see by multiplying the upper bounds of a and b: ab < 10^6 cdot 10^6 = 10^{12}. We are also given that the least common multiple of a and b has 10 digits, which means that mathop{text{lcm}}[a,b] is at least 10^9, since the smallest 10-digit number is 10^9. Substituting these bounds into our equation for gcd(a,b), we find: gcd(a,b) < frac{10^{12}}{10^9} = 10^3. This inequality tells us that the greatest common divisor of a and b is less than 10^3, which means that gcd(a,b) has at most 3 digits.

According to the South Pole theorem (Théorème du pôle sud), the points ( M, A, B, ) and ( D ) are concyclic. 4. **Angle Relationships**: - Since ( [AD] ) is bisected at ( M ), and ( M ) lies on the angle bisector of ( angle ABD ), we can deduce that the angles ( angle BDM ) and ( angle BAM ) are such that: [ angle BAM = frac{1}{2} angle BAC ] Similarly, [ angle ADM = 90^circ ] 5. **Use of Chasles' Relation**: Apply Chasles' relation (angle addition): [ angle NMN - angle NMI = (angle NMB + angle BAI) + angle IAC) + angle CAI) ] Substituting the known relationships and using the angle bisectors, [ angle NMN - angle NMI = 90^circ + frac{1}{2} angle BAC + frac{1}{2} angle BCA ] 6. **Cyclic Point Conclusion**: As per the above deductions: [ angle NMN - angle NMI = angle BCA ] Therefore, ( (NM, NI) = (AM, AI) ). This ensures that points ( A, M, I, ) and ( N ) lie on the same circle. Conclusively, the points ( A, I, M, ) and ( N ) are concyclic as per the analysis.

Find all complex numbers z such that sum_{k=0}^{3^{1010}1}(2)^{f(k)}(z+k)^{2023}=0","completion":"1. **Partitioning the Elements**: We partition the elements from (0) to (3^{1010}-1) into sets (S_I), where (I subseteq {0, 1, cdots, 1009}). Each element (a) in (S_I) can be represented in base 3 as (a = (overline{a_{1009}a_{1008}cdots a_{0}})_3) such that (a_i = 1) if and only if (i notin I). Therefore, (f(a) = 1010 - |I|) for all (a in S_I), and (|S_I| = 2^{|I|}). 2. **Rewriting the Sum**: Let (omega = z + sum_{i=0}^{1009} 3^i) and (u_i = 3^i). We can express the sum as: [ sum_{a in S_I} (-2)^{f(a)}(z+a)^{2023} = sum_{a in S_I} (-2)^{1010-|I|}left(omega + (a - sum_{i=0}^{1009} 3^i)right)^{2023} ] Since (|S_I| = 2^{|I|}), we have: [ sum_{a in S_I} (-2)^{f(a)}(z+a)^{2023} = 2^{|I|}(-2)^{1010-|I|} mathbb{E}left[left(omega + sum_{i in I} 3^i X_iright)^{2023}right] ] where (X_i) are independent random variables taking values (1) and (-1) with equal probability. 3. **Expectation Calculation**: The expectation (mathbb{E}left[left(omega + sum_{i in I} 3^i X_iright)^{2023}right]) can be expanded using the multinomial theorem. The key observation is that (mathbb{E}[X_i^{alpha_i}]) is (1) when (alpha_i) is even and (0) when (alpha_i) is odd. 4. **Coefficient Analysis**: We consider the coefficient of (prod_{i=0}^{1009} u_i^{alpha_i} omega^j) in the expansion. This coefficient is nonzero if and only if (sum_{i=0}^{1009} alpha_i + j = 2023), (2 mid alpha_i), and (forall i) with (alpha_i neq 0), (i in I). 5. **Summing Over All Sets**: The sum over all sets (I) is: [ sum_{I subseteq {0, 1, cdots, 1009}} 2^{1010}(-1)^{|I|} mathbb{E}left[left(omega + sum_{i in I} X_i u_iright)^{2023}right] ] Fixing (sum_{i=0}^{1009} alpha_i + j = 2023), (2 mid alpha_i), and (J = {i mid alpha_i neq 0}), we get: [ sum_{J subseteq I subseteq {0, 1, cdots, 1009}} C(-1)^{|I|} ] where (C) is a constant independent of the choice of (I). This sum is zero unless (J = I), indicating (alpha_i ge 2) for all (i). 6. **Simplifying the Expression**: The non-vanishing terms occur when (alpha_i = 2) for all (i) or exactly one (alpha_i = 4) with all others being (2).

This implies that by setting the two expressions for x equal to each other, we can find a relationship between y and z: frac{24}{y} = frac{48}{z} implies 24z = 48y implies z = 2y. Given z = 2y, we can substitute this into the equation yz = 72 to find y: y(2y) = 72 implies 2y^2 = 72 implies y^2 = 36. Solving for y, we get: y = 6.

Given the triangle ( triangle ABC ) with ( A > B > C ), ( A + C = 2B ), ( AB = 4 ), and ( BC = 5 ). 2. We need to find the side length of the largest inscribed square in ( triangle ABC ). 3. Establish vertical heights corresponding to the sides of the triangle and denote the side lengths of the square touching ( BC, CA, AB ) as ( x, y, z ) respectively. 4. The formula for the side of the square inscribed in a right triangle with base ( a ) and height ( h ) is: [ frac{h - x}{h} = frac{x}{a} ] Rearranging: [ frac{h - x}{x} = frac{h}{a} ] So: [ frac{h}{x} = frac{h + a}{a} Rightarrow x = frac{a h}{h + a} ] 5.

We can repeat the above argument since: [ binom{46}{2} = frac{46 cdot 45}{2} = 1035, ] which is still greater than (2^{10} = 1024). Again applying the pigeonhole principle, we can similarly find pairs where the product of four numbers is a perfect square. - If the numbers in ( (x, y, z, t) ) are distinct, they are our solution. - If any duplicate exists (e.g., (y = t)), (x cdot z) is a perfect square. 10. Ultimately, we will find four distinct numbers (a, b, c, d) such that their product is a perfect square.

Simplifying this equation: [ 2 cdot frac{(n-2) cdot 180}{n} = 3 cdot frac{360}{m} ] [ frac{2 cdot (n-2) cdot 180}{n} = frac{3 cdot 360}{m} ] [ frac{360(n-2)}{n} = frac{1080}{m} ] 5. Multiplying both sides of the equation by mn to eliminate the fractions: [ 360m(n-2) = 1080n ] [ 360mn - 720m = 1080n ] 6. Rearranging the terms: [ 360mn - 1080n = 720m ] [ 360mn - 1080n = 720m ] [ 360mn - 1080n - 720m = 0 ] 7. Dividing the entire equation by 360 to simplify: [ mn - 3n - 2m = 0 ] [ mn - 3n = 2m ] [ mn - 3n - 2m = 0 ] [ mn - 2m - 3n = 0 ] 8. Taking common factors and rearranging for simplicity: [ m(n - 2) = 3n ] [ m = frac{3n}{n - 2} ] 9. Now, m must be an integer, and hence frac{3n}{n-2} must be an integer. We test various integer values for n: - For n = 3: [ m = frac{3 cdot 3}{3-2} = 9 ] Thus, (n, m) = (3, 9). - For n = 4: [ m = frac{3 cdot 4}{4-2} = frac{12}{2} = 6 ] Thus, (n, m) = (4, 6). - For n = 5: [ m = frac{3 cdot 5}{5-2} = frac{15}{3} = 5 ] Thus, (n, m) = (5, 5). - For n = 8: [ m = frac{3 cdot 8}{8-2} = frac{24}{6} = 4 ] Thus, (n, m) = (8, 4). These computed values of n and m are verified as matching using the original criteria stated. We now enumerate the confirmed pairs.

Determine the value of n such that eventually (possibly after many rounds), every student has at least one candy.","completion":": 1. Let us denote the problem as determining the conditions on n such that every student in a group of n students (arranged in a circle) gets at least one candy after following the given game rules. 2. The rule stipulates distributing candies in an increasing interval: 1 candy to the first student, skip 1 student and 1 candy to the next, skip 2 students and 1 candy to the next, and so on, moving counter-clockwise. This leads to the sequence of positions receiving candies being given by the sums 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + x modulo n. 3. We wish to verify whether 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + x modulo n can cover every residue class from 0 to n-1 at least once. 4. Let's analyze specific values of n to determine whether all residues are covered: - For ( n = 2 ): [ begin{aligned} &1 equiv 1 pmod{2}, &1 + 2 = 3 equiv 1 pmod{2}, &1 + 2 + 3 = 6 equiv 0 pmod{2}. end{aligned} ] Both residues (0 and 1) modulo 2 are covered, so ( n = 2 ) works. - For ( n = 3 ): [ begin{aligned} &1 equiv 1 pmod{3}, &1 + 2 = 3 equiv 0 pmod{3}, &1 + 2 + 3 = 6 equiv 0 pmod{3}, &cdots end{aligned} ] The residues 0 and 1 are covered, but 2 is not, so ( n = 3 ) does not work. - Continue similarly for other small values: - For ( n = 4 ): [ begin{aligned} &1 equiv 1 pmod{4}, &1 + 2 = 3 equiv 3 pmod{4}, &1 + 2 + 3 = 6 equiv 2 pmod{4}, &1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 equiv 2 pmod{4}, &1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 equiv 3 pmod{4}, &1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21 equiv 1 pmod{4}, &1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28 equiv 0 pmod{4}. end{aligned} ] Thus, every residue mod 4 is covered, so it works for ( n = 4 ). - For ( n = 5 ): [ begin{aligned} &1 equiv 1 pmod{5}, &1 + 2 = 3 equiv 3 pmod{5}, &1 + 2 + 3 = 6 equiv 1 pmod{5}, &1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 equiv 0 pmod{5}, &1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 equiv 0 pmod{5}. end{aligned} ] All possible residues mod 5 except 2 and 4 are not covered in the sequence, so ( n = 5 ) does not work. 5. The above processes suggest that not every value of n satisfies the requirement. We hypothesize that if n is a power of 2, then all residues are guaranteed to be covered. 6. To prove this hypothesis, consider n = 2^k. The key observation is that the sums [ 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + x = frac{x(x+1)}{2} ] modulo 2^k will cycle through all pairs of integers mod 2^k, ensuring that each residue is covered. 7. Conversely, for n containing an odd prime factor p, the residues cannot all be covered because the sums modulo p do not cycle through all residues evenly, showing a periodic pattern with gaps. # Conclusion: Thereby, we establish that the only values of n that guarantee each student gets at least one candy are those that are powers of 2.

Expanding and simplifying, we get: [ W = -x^2 + 200x - 8400 = -(x - 100)^2 + 1600 ] Since the parabola opens downwards, the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 100. However, the selling price x must be within 60 leq x leq 90. - When x = 90, we calculate the profit W as follows: [ W = -(90 - 100)^2 + 1600 = 1500 ] Therefore, the maximum profit of 1500 dollars can be obtained when the selling price is set at 90 dollars. boxed{text{Selling price} = 90, text{Maximum profit} = 1500} (3) Range of Selling Prices x for a Profit Not Less Than 1200 - Setting W = 1200, we solve the equation 1200 = -x^2 + 200x - 8400 for x. - This yields two solutions, x_1 = 80 and x_2 = 120. However, since the selling price must be within 60 leq x leq 90, the feasible range of selling prices x for a profit of at least 1200 is 80 leq x leq 90. boxed{80 leq x leq 90}"},{"prompt":"Simplify:<br/>(1)2a^{2}3a^{3}+5a+2a^{3}a^{2};<br/>(2)frac{2}{3}(2ab)+2(b2a)3(2ab)frac{4}{3}(b2a).","completion":"To simplify the given expressions, we'll tackle them one at a time, following the provided solutions closely but breaking down the steps further for clarity. # For Expression (1) 2a^{2}-3a^{3}+5a+2a^{3}-a^{2}: 1.

Show that there exists a set of n stones such that no two of them are ever in the same row or column.","completion":"1. We begin by setting up the problem in the language of graph theory. We consider an 8 times 8 grid where each row and each column contains exactly 3 stones (or cailloux). 2. Let's translate this into an equivalence with bipartite graphs. Let us consider each row as one set (R) of vertices and each column as another set (C) of vertices, creating a bipartite graph (G = (R, C, E)), where an edge exists between a row ( r_i ) and a column ( c_j ) if and only if there is a stone at position ((i, j)). 3. By hypothesis, each row and each column has exactly 3 stones. Thus, each vertex in the sets (R) and (C) has precisely degree 3. 4. To utilize Hall's Marriage Theorem, we need to verify its condition. According to Hall's Marriage Theorem, there exists a matching that covers every vertex in (R) if and only if for every subset (S subseteq R), the number of neighbors of (S) in (C) (denoted (|N(S)|)) is at least as large as (|S|), that is, (|N(S)| geq |S|). 5. Now, consider any subset (S subseteq R) with (|S| = k). This subset corresponds to (k) rows, and since each row contains exactly 3 stones, these (k) rows must contain exactly (3k) stones. 6. These (3k) stones are distributed among the columns, but since each column contains at most 3 stones, they must appear in at least (k) columns. Therefore, the number of distinct columns that contain these (3k) stones is at least ( frac{3k}{3} = k ). 7. Thus, for any subset (S subseteq R) with (|S| = k), we have (|N(S)| geq k). Therefore, Hall's Marriage Theorem condition is satisfied. 8. By Hall's Marriage Theorem, there exists a perfect matching in this bipartite graph (G). This perfect matching pairs each row exactly once to a unique column, ensuring that no two stones in the matching share the same row or column. 9.

Therefore, we have: [g(x) = a{x}^{3} + frac{b}{x}] Given the domain of g(x) and f(x) excludes x=0, we can consider the behavior of g(x) for both positive and negative values of x excluding zero.

Simplifying this, we find 2angle B = 180^{circ}, which means angle B = 90^{circ}. This implies that triangle ABC is a right triangle with angle B as the right angle, which contradicts the question's premise that we are looking for a condition that cannot determine a right triangle. - **Option B**: With the ratio angle A : angle B : angle C = 1 : 2 : 3, and knowing the sum of angles in a triangle is 180^{circ}, we can express this as angle A + 2angle A + 3angle A = 180^{circ}, leading to 6angle A = 180^{circ}.

This is the Pythagorean theorem, which directly implies that triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle opposite side c. This contradicts the question's premise as well. - **Option D**: Testing the ratio a : b : c = 4 : 5 : 6 with the Pythagorean theorem, we check if 4^{2} + 5^{2} = 6^{2}.

Since the ratio of shirts to the total number of items is 10 parts out of a total of 7 (pants) + 7 (shorts) + 10 (shirts) = 24 parts, we can set up the following proportion to find the number of pants: Shirts / Total parts = Number of shirts / Total number of items 10 / 24 = 20 / Total number of items Now we can solve for the total number of items (T): 10T = 24 * 20 10T = 480 T = 480 / 10 T = 48 So, there are a total of 48 items in the dresser.

The formula for combinations is ( C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} ), where ( n ) is the total number of items, ( k ) is the number of items to choose, and ( ! ) denotes factorial. For case 1, we have 2 paperbacks and 6 hardbacks, so the number of ways to choose 1 paperback and 2 hardbacks is: ( C(2, 1) times C(6, 2) = 2 times frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 2 times frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1} = 2 times 15 = 30 ) For case 2, the number of ways to choose 2 paperbacks and 1 hardback is: ( C(2, 2) times C(6, 1) = 1 times 6 = 6 ) Adding these up gives us the total number of ways to select 3 books that include at least one paperback: ( 30 + 6 = 36 ) Since we've already accounted for all 36 possible selections with just the known paperbacks and hardbacks, there are no additional books of unknown type on the shelf.

Here, ( p ) and ( q ) are relatively prime positive integers. 2. **Representation of Integers:** Since ( p ) and ( q ) are relatively prime, any integer ( x ) can be represented in the form ( x = ap + bq ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are integer coefficients. This is a consequence of the fact that ( p ) and ( q ) being relatively prime implies that their linear combinations can generate any integer. 3. **Ideal Subset Property:** Every ideal subset ( S ) must contain all integers of the form ( up + vq ) for non-negative integers ( u ) and ( v ). This is because if ( n in S ), then ( n + p in S ) and ( n + q in S ), and by induction, all such combinations must be in ( S ). 4. **Characterizing Non-Members:** If an integer ( x ) is not in ( S ), it must be of the form ( x = ap + bq ) where either ( a ) or ( b ) is negative. We can reduce ( x ) to a form where ( -q < a < 0 ) and ( 0 < b < p ) with the condition ( frac{b}{-a} > frac{p}{q} ). 5. **Defining Ideal Subsets:** Every ideal subset is uniquely defined by a pair of sequences: [ q > -a_1 > -a_2 > dots > -a_m > 0 quad text{and} quad p > b_1 > b_2 > dots > b_m > 0 ] with the condition ( frac{b_j}{-a_j} > frac{p}{q} ) for all ( j = 1, dots, m ). 6. **Counting Ideal Subsets:** The number of such sequences corresponds to the number of paths from ( (0,0) ) to ( (q,p) ) in the integer grid ([0,q] times [0,p]) where each step increments both coordinates and does not go below the line connecting the points ( (0,0) ) and ( (q,p) ). 7. **Lattice Path Counting:** The number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{p+q}{p} ).

Which of the above statements are correct?","completion":"First, let's address each proposition separately. **Proposition ①: f(2) = 0** Given that f(x) is an even function, we know that f(-x) = f(x). Since f(x + 4) = f(x) + f(2) for all x in mathbb{R}, we can substitute x = 0 to get f(4) = f(2). Because f(x) is monotonically decreasing on [0,2], and f(4) = f(2), we infer that the function is flat (constant) on that interval. Since an even function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, the function is also flat on [-2, 0]. Therefore, f(-2) = f(2) = f(0). However, without additional information, we cannot conclude that f(2) = 0. Proposition ① is not necessarily true. **Proposition ②: x = -4 is a line of symmetry for the graph of y = f(x)** For every x, we have f(x + 4) = f(x) + f(2). Using the even property, f(-x - 4) = f(-x) + f(2). But since f(-x) = f(x), we deduce that f(-x - 4) = f(x) + f(2). Therefore, the function has the same values at points that are symmetric with respect to the line x = -4. Since we know that even functions are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, having an additional line of symmetry implies that f(x + 4) = f(x) for all x. This is because f(2) would need to be zero for the additional symmetry to hold. Proposition ② implies Proposition ①. However, since we concluded that Proposition ① is not necessarily true, Proposition ② is also not necessarily true. **Proposition ③: The function y = f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval [8, 10]** Since f(x + 4) = f(x) + f(2), in the interval [0, 2], where f(x) is monotonically decreasing, we can repeat this pattern the intervals [4, 6] and [8, 10] accordingly. However, the fact that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on [0, 2] does not necessarily mean f(x) is monotonically increasing on [8, 10]. We must also consider the effect of adding f(2) when applying the f(x + 4) relation. Without more specific information about the function f(x) or the value of f(2), we cannot confirm if Proposition ③ is true. **Proposition ④: If the equation f(x) = m has two roots x_1 and x_2 in the interval [-6, -2], then x_1 + x_2 = -8** Since f(x) is an even function, the roots will occur in pairs that are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Given two roots x_1 and x_2 in the interval [-6, -2], it implies that there are corresponding roots at -x_1 and -x_2. Now, if we use the periodicity given by f(x + 4) = f(x) + f(2), these roots must repeat every four units. Thus, x_1 + 4 and x_2 + 4 would be roots in the interval [-2, 2], but due to symmetry, they would actually be -x_1 and -x_2. This indicates that -x_1 = x_1 + 4 and -x_2 = x_2 + 4, yielding x_1 = -2 and x_2 = -6. Their sum is indeed -8, proving Proposition ④ correct.

Our goal is to show that ( M geq N ). 3. Consider the following transformation to simplify the sequence: - If there are two consecutive 1's, we can remove them.

In such a sequence where 1's and 0's alternate: - All pairs (1, 0) are those with an even number of digits between them because they are simply consecutive pairs with no other digits in between. - There are no pairs with odd numbers of digits between them in this reduced sequence. 7.

According to the information given: 1. A man, a woman, and a boy together can complete the work in 4 days. Therefore, their combined work rate is 1/4 of the work per day. 2. A man alone can do the work in 6 days, so his work rate is 1/6 of the work per day. 3. A woman alone takes 36 days to complete the work, so her work rate is 1/36 of the work per day. We need to find out how long the boy takes to complete the work alone, so we need to find B. From the first point, we can write the combined work rate as: M + W + B = 1/4 From the second point, we know: M = 1/6 From the third point, we know: W = 1/36 Now we can substitute the values of M and W into the first equation to solve for B: (1/6) + (1/36) + B = 1/4 To solve for B, we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The common denominator for 6, 36, and 4 is 36. So we convert all fractions to have the denominator of 36: (6/36) + (1/36) + B = 9/36 Now combine the fractions on the left side: 7/36 + B = 9/36 Subtract 7/36 from both sides to isolate B: B = 9/36 - 7/36 B = 2/36 Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2: B = 1/18 This means the boy's work rate is 1/18 of the work per day.

So we convert the fractions: p((a ∩ b) ∪ (c ∩ d)) = (4/25) * (15/15) + (1/15) * (25/25) - (4/375) p((a ∩ b) ∪ (c ∩ d)) = (60/375) + (25/375) - (4/375) p((a ∩ b) ∪ (c ∩ d)) = (85/375) - (4/375) p((a ∩ b) ∪ (c ∩ d)) = 81/375 Now we simplify the fraction: p((a ∩ b) ∪ (c ∩ d)) = 81/375 = 27/125 Therefore, the probability of the event (a ∩ b) ∪ (c ∩ d) is boxed{27/125} ."},{"prompt":"For any positive integer n, the relationship between 2^{n} and n^{2} is ( ) A: When n > 2, 2^{n} > n^{2} B: When n > 3, 2^{n} > n^{2} C: When n > 4, 2^{n} > n^{2} D: When n > 5, 2^{n} > n^{2}","completion":"Solution: When n=1, n^{2} < 2^{n}; When n=2, n^{2}=2^{n}; When n=3, n^{2} > 2^{n}; When n=4, n^{2}=2^{n}; When n=5, n^{2} < 2^{n}; When n=6, n^{2} < 2^{n}; Conjecture: When n geqslant 5, n^{2} < 2^{n} Next, we prove this conjecture using mathematical induction: (1) When n=5, the conjecture holds true as explored above. (2) Assume the conjecture holds when n=k (k geqslant 5), i.e., 2^{k} > k^{2}. Then 2 cdot 2^{k} > 2k^{2}, Since 2k^{2}-(k+1)^{2}=k^{2}-2k-1=(k-1)^{2}-2 When k geqslant 5, (k-1)^{2}-2 > 0, Therefore, 2k^{2} > (k+1)^{2} Thus, 2^{k+1} > (k+1)^{2} So, the conjecture also holds when n=k+1.

To do this, we need to find the coordinates of the circles' centers and their radii. Based on their positions relative to each other, we can determine the number of common tangents. Step 1: Find the center and radius of the first circle. The given circle x^{2}+y^{2}+4x-4y+7=0 can be rewritten as (x+2)^{2}+(y-2)^{2}=1. Thus, its center is at (-2,2) and its radius is 1. Step 2: Find the center and radius of the second circle. The given circle x^{2}+y^{2}-4x+10y+13=0 can be rewritten as (x-2)^{2}+(y+5)^{2}=16. Thus, its center is at (2,-5) and its radius is 4. Step 3: Determine the position relationship between the two circles. Calculate the distance between the two centers: sqrt{(-2-2)^{2}+(2+5)^{2}}=sqrt{65}. Since sqrt{65}>1+4, the distance between the two centers is greater than the sum of their radii. Step 4: Determine the number of common tangents. Since the two circles are separated from each other, they have 4 common tangent lines.
