Therefore, we set the exponent of x to zero: [4-2r = 0] Solving for r, we find: [r = 2] Note: The solution r = frac{5}{2} is discarded because r must be an integer in the binomial expansion. 3. **Calculate the Constant Term**: Substituting r = 2 into the general term formula, we get: [(-a)^{2} cdot left(frac{1}{2}right)^{2} cdot C_{4}^{2}] [= a^{2} cdot frac{1}{4} cdot 6] [= frac{3}{2}a^{2}] 4. **Solve for a**: Given that the constant term is 24, we set the expression equal to 24 and solve for a^2: [frac{3}{2}a^{2} = 24] [a^{2} = 16] Taking the square root of both sides, we find: [a = pm4] Therefore, the value of the real number a is boxed{pm 4}."},{"prompt":"f the proposition exists xin R, x^{2}ax+5 lt 0 is a true proposition, then the range of real number a is ______.","completion":"To determine the range of real number a for which the proposition \\"exists xin R, x^{2}-ax+5 < 0\\" is true, we need to analyze the quadratic inequality x^{2}-ax+5 < 0. For a quadratic equation x^{2}-ax+5 = 0, the discriminant Delta plays a crucial role in understanding the nature of its roots. The discriminant Delta is given by: [ Delta = b^{2}-4ac ] In our case, a = -a, b = 1, and c = 5, so we substitute these values into the discriminant formula: [ Delta = (-a)^{2}-4(1)(5) = a^{2}-20 ] For the inequality x^{2}-ax+5 < 0 to have real solutions, the discriminant Delta must be greater than 0.

The product of the roots of the equation, according to Vieta's formulas, is 16. Therefore, we have a_1 cdot a_{19} = 16. Since a_{19} = a_1 cdot r^{18}, we substitute this into the equation to get a_1 cdot (a_1 cdot r^{18}) = 16, which simplifies to a_1^2 cdot r^{18} = 16. To find a_8 cdot a_{10} cdot a_{12}, we express each term in terms of a_1 and r: a_8 = a_1 cdot r^7, a_{10} = a_1 cdot r^9, and a_{12} = a_1 cdot r^{11}. Multiplying these together gives a_8 cdot a_{10} cdot a_{12} = a_1^3 cdot r^{27}.

Therefore, the total number of possible scoring schemes for one participant is: [ 3^8 ] Since A and B get the same score from exactly 4 people, we need to choose 4 out of 8 judges to give the same score to both A and B.

Following the same reasoning: - The sum of the interior angles is: [ (n-2) times 180^circ ] - The sum of each pair of interior and exterior angles is: [ n times 180^circ ] - Thus, the sum of the exterior angles is: [ sum (text{Exterior angle}) = n times 180^circ - (n-2) times 180^circ ] Simplifying: [ n times 180^circ - (n-2) times 180^circ = n times 180^circ - n times 180^circ + 2 times 180^circ = 2 times 180^circ = 360^circ ] 4. **Conclusion**: The sum of the exterior angles of any convex polygon, regardless of the number of sides, is always: [ boxed{360^circ} ] For the specific case of a convex pentagon, the sum of the exterior angles is: [ boxed{360^circ} ]"},{"prompt":"(1) Given the curve y=x+ln x, the tangent line at point (1,1) intersects with the curve y=ax^2+(a+2)x+1.

[Enhanced Solution] Given y=x+ln x, calculate its derivative: y'=1+frac{1}{x}. At x=1, we have y'|{_{x=1}}=2. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line at point (1,1) is: y-1=2(x-1), which simplifies to y=2x-1. Since the tangent line is also tangent to the curve y=ax^2+(a+2)x+1, their intersection must yield exactly one root. Therefore, we can set up the quadratic equation: 2x-1=ax^2+(a+2)x+1, which, when rearranged and simplified, becomes: ax^2+ax+2=0. Since this quadratic equation has only one root, its discriminant must be zero: Δ=a^2-8a=0. Solving for a, we obtain a=0 (rejected, as it would make the equation linear) or a=8.

Consequently, AB=x_1+x_2+2=8. For BC+AD, we have BC+AD=x_1+x_2+4=10. For |CD|, we have |CD|=sqrt{(y_1+y_2)^2-4y_1y_2}=4sqrt{2}. Therefore, the perimeter of quadrilateral ABCD is 18+4sqrt{2}.

We need to prove that the total number of candies taken by the boys does not depend on the order in which the children take their turns. 1. **Suppose the number of children is ( k ), including boys and girls. Let ( n = 2021 ) be the total number of candies.** 2. **For any child (let's call them ( C_i )) approaching the pile:** - Let ( n_i ) be the number of candies when ( C_i ) approaches the pile. - If ( n_i ) is the number of candies and ( k_i ) is the number of children remaining including ( C_i ), then the child computes ( leftlfloor frac{n_i}{k_i} rightrfloor ) if the child is a girl and ( leftlceil frac{ n_i}{ k_i } rightrceil ) if the child is a boy. 3. **Assume we swap the order of two consecutive children ( C_i ) and ( C_{i+1} ):** - Let ( C_i ) be a boy and ( C_{i+1} ) be a girl (or vice versa). - If ( n_i ) is the number of candies, before ( C_i ) approaches, then: - The boy takes ( leftlceil frac{ n_i}{ k_i } rightrceil ) candies, leaving ( n_{i+1} = n_i - leftlceil frac{ n_i}{ k_i } rightrceil ) candies. - The girl would then take ( leftlfloor frac{n_{i+1}}{ k_{i+1} } rightrfloor ) candies. 4. **Result after swap:** - If the girl goes first, she takes ( leftlfloor frac{ n_i}{ k_i } rightrfloor ) candies, leaving ( n_i' = n_i - leftlfloor frac{n_i}{ k_i } rightrfloor ) candies. - Then the boy takes ( leftlceil frac{ n_i' }{ k_{i+1} } rightrceil ). 5. **In either case, observe:** - Whether the boy goes first or the girl goes first, after accounting for the rounding differences, the sum of the candies taken by both in either order sets remains the same. 6. **Conclusion:** - Swapping any pair of adjacent children (a boy and a girl) does not change the total number of candies taken by the boys or by the girls. - Since any permutation of the children's order can be achieved by a series of adjacent swaps, it follows that the total number of candies taken by the boys (and by girls) remains constant regardless of the order in which the children take their turns.

The number of stones left is 2002, which is even. B will always aim to leave an odd number of stones for A's turn. 5. **Divisors of Even Numbers**: For any even number, its divisors include both even and odd numbers. B can always choose to remove an odd divisor (including 1) to ensure that the remaining number of stones is odd. 6. **Ensuring Odd Number for A**: By always removing an odd number of stones, B ensures that A always faces an odd number of stones on his turn. 7. **Endgame Scenario**: Eventually, the number of stones will be reduced to 2.

This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the bridge. The speed of the train is given in kilometers per hour (km/hr), so we need to convert it to meters per second (m/s) to match the units of the length of the train and the time taken to cross the bridge. The conversion factor from km/hr to m/s is: 1 km/hr = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 75 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) = 20.833333333333332 m/s Now, we can use the formula for distance (d), which is the product of speed (v) and time (t): d = v * t The time taken to cross the bridge is given as 11.279097672186225 seconds, and the speed of the train is 20.833333333333332 m/s.

One way to achieve this is to cut a small hole at the center of the resulting rectangle in the first piece of cardboard. 4. **Reconfigure the figures**: - Move one of the square cardboards such that it overlaps with the other, but now the center of the resulting rectangular configuration does not align with the center of any individual piece, as illustrated in Figure 5(b). 5. **Consider another solution**: - Another configuration involves flipping one cardboard before overlapping them. In this way, the resulting figure and its center will adjust accordingly, ensuring the nail can pass through only one cardboard. 6. **Note on configuration**: - If the cardboards do not overlap fully and still cover the entire base of the rectangular box without complete coincidence, the nail, placed in the center of the box, must intersect the boundary separating the two cardboards.

Given that the profit per meter of cloth is 15 and the cost price per meter is 90, we can calculate the selling price per meter as follows: Selling Price per meter = Cost Price per meter + Profit per meter Selling Price per meter = 90 + 15 Selling Price per meter = 105 Now that we have the selling price per meter, we can calculate the total selling price for 85 meters of cloth: Total Selling Price = Selling Price per meter * Total meters of cloth Total Selling Price = 105 * 85 Total Selling Price = 8925 Therefore, the total selling price of the cloth is boxed{8925} ."},{"prompt":"The ratio of the median AM of a triangle ABC to the side BC equals sqrt{3}:2 . The points on the sides of ABC dividing these side into 3 equal parts are marked. Prove that some 4 of these 6 points are concyclic.","completion":"1. **Given**: The ratio of the median ( AM ) of a triangle ( ABC ) to the side ( BC ) equals ( sqrt{3}:2 ). We need to prove that some 4 of the 6 points dividing the sides of ( ABC ) into 3 equal parts are concyclic. 2. **Setup**: We use complex numbers to represent the points. Let ( M = 0 ), ( B = 1 ), ( C = -1 ), and ( A = a ) such that ( a overline{a} = 3 ). This condition ensures that the length of ( AM ) is ( sqrt{3} ) times the length of ( BC ). 3. **Trisection Points**: Using the section formula, the trisection points on the sides of the triangle are: [ frac{2a+1}{3}, quad frac{a+2}{3}, quad frac{1}{3}, quad frac{-1}{3}, quad frac{2a-1}{3}, quad frac{a-2}{3} ] 4. **Concyclic Condition**: To prove that four of these points are concyclic, we need to show that they lie on a common circle. For four points ( z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4 ) to be concyclic, the cross-ratio (frac{(z_1 - z_3)(z_2 - z_4)}{(z_1 - z_4)(z_2 - z_3)}) must be real. 5. **Cross-Ratio Calculation**: Consider the points ( frac{a+2}{3}, frac{-1}{3}, frac{2a-1}{3}, frac{a-2}{3} ). We need to show that: [ frac{frac{frac{a+2}{3} - frac{-1}{3}}{frac{a+2}{3} - frac{a-2}{3}}}{frac{frac{2a-1}{3} - frac{-1}{3}}{frac{2a-1}{3} - frac{a-2}{3}}} in mathbb{R} ] 6. **Simplification**: [ frac{frac{frac{a+2+1}{3}}{frac{a+2-a+2}{3}}}{frac{frac{2a-1+1}{3}}{frac{2a-1-a+2}{3}}} = frac{frac{frac{a+3}{3}}{frac{4}{3}}}{frac{frac{2a}{3}}{frac{a+1}{3}}} = frac{frac{a+3}{4}}{frac{2a}{a+1}} ] 7. **Further Simplification**: [ frac{frac{a+3}{4}}{frac{2a}{a+1}} = frac{(a+3)(a+1)}{8a} = frac{a^2 + 4a + 3}{8a} ] 8. **Real Part**: Since ( a overline{a} = 3 ), ( a ) is a complex number such that ( |a| = sqrt{3} ). The expression ( frac{a^2 + 4a + 3}{8a} ) must be real, which can be verified by substituting ( a ) and checking the imaginary part. 9. **Conclusion**: The cross-ratio is real, thus proving that the four points ( frac{a+2}{3}, frac{-1}{3}, frac{2a-1}{3}, frac{a-2}{3} ) are concyclic.

Using the law of cosines, we have cos angle ABC = frac{AB^{2}+BC^{2}-AC^{2}}{2ABcdot BC}. Substituting the inequality AB^{2}+BC^{2} < AC^{2} into this expression, we obtain: [ cos angle ABC = frac{AB^{2}+BC^{2}-AC^{2}}{2ABcdot BC} < frac{AC^{2}-AC^{2}}{2ABcdot BC} = 0 ] Since cos angle ABC < 0, angle ABC is greater than 90^circ, making it obtuse, and therefore, triangle ABC is an obtuse triangle. This shows that the condition is sufficient. 2. **Necessity**: We examine if every obtuse triangle must satisfy AB^{2}+BC^{2} < AC^{2}. For triangle ABC to be obtuse, at least one angle must be greater than 90^circ. However, the obtuse angle does not necessarily have to be angle ABC. It could be angle BAC or angle BCA. Therefore, the specific condition AB^{2}+BC^{2} < AC^{2} does not necessarily apply to all obtuse triangles, indicating that the condition is not necessary for triangle ABC to be an obtuse triangle. Combining the findings: The inequality AB^{2}+BC^{2} < AC^{2} is a sufficient condition for triangle ABC to be an obtuse triangle because it guarantees at least one angle (angle ABC in this case) is greater than 90^circ. However, it is not a necessary condition because an obtuse triangle can have its obtuse angle at vertices other than B, and this specific inequality may not hold.

These include the subgrids starting at (0,0), (2, 0), (0, 2), and (2, 2), making a total of 4 diagonally placed larger squares: [ begin{pmatrix} (0, 0) & (0, 2) (2, 0) & (2, 2) end{pmatrix} ] Each of these larger grid cells contains 2 times 2 subgrids which can be represented as: [ ((text{row*2}, text{col*2}) + (i, j)) ] for i, j in 0 to 1 and text{row, col} in 0 to 1. 5. **Counting Non-overlapping 2 times 2 Subgrids:** On any 8 of these 2 times 2 grid cells, color them. Since we are coloring exactly 8 squares and there are only 9 diagonal 2times2 subgrids (each diagonal counts for exactly one 2times2 grid square), at best, each color square affects one diagonal grid. 6. **Utilizing Pigeonhole Principle:** By the pigeonhole principle, if there are 9 subgrids and only 8 are used, there must be at least one diagonal subgrid which is left unaffected by the placement of these 8 colored smaller squares.

This is because each of (a_i), (b_i), and (c_i) are permutations of (1, 2, ldots, 6), and thus their product is (6!). 3. **Possible Values of (a_i b_i c_i):** We need to consider the possible values of (a_i b_i c_i).

Therefore, the maximum and minimum values of f(x) in the interval [frac{1}{e},e] can only be attained at f(1), f(frac{1}{e}), and f(e). Calculating these values, we have f(1)=frac{5}{4}, f(frac{1}{e})=frac{3}{2}+frac{1}{4e^{2}}, and f(e)=frac{1}{2}+frac{e^{2}}{4}. Hence, the maximum value is f(e)=boxed{frac{1}{2}+frac{e^{2}}{4}}, and the minimum value is f(1)=boxed{frac{5}{4}}. (II) The derivative of the function is f'(x)=frac{(a+1)x^{2}+a}{x}, where xin(0,+infty). 1. When a+1leqslant 0, i.e., aleqslant -1, f'(x) < 0, so f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,+infty); 2.

Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}},+infty) and monotonically decreasing on (0,sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}). In summary, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty) when ageqslant 0; monotonically increasing on (sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}},+infty) and monotonically decreasing on (0,sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}) when -1 < a < 0; and monotonically decreasing on (0,+infty) when aleqslant -1.

Solving this system of equations, we start with the first equation: x + y = 100 We can express y in terms of x: y = 100 - x Substituting y in the second equation: 120x + 100(100 - x) = 11200 Simplifying: 120x + 10000 - 100x = 11200 20x = 1200 x = 60 Substituting x = 60 into y = 100 - x: y = 100 - 60 = 40 Therefore, the store purchased boxed{60} pieces of style A clothing and boxed{40} pieces of style B clothing. Part 2: Let m represent the number of pieces of style A clothing purchased by the other store, and thus (60 - m) represents the number of pieces of style B clothing purchased. The profit from selling style A clothing is (200 - 120)m, and the profit from selling style B clothing is (140 - 100)(60 - m). The total profit must be at least 3300 yuan, leading to the inequality: (200 - 120)m + (140 - 100)(60 - m) geqslant 3300 Simplifying the inequality: 80m + 40(60 - m) geqslant 3300 80m + 2400 - 40m geqslant 3300 40m geqslant 900 m geqslant 22.5 Since m must be a whole number (as you cannot purchase a fraction of a clothing piece), the minimum number of pieces of style A clothing that should be purchased is boxed{23}."},{"prompt":"Anton received several zucchini from the village and decided to distribute them to his friends.

The problem states that opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, and the diagonals connecting opposite vertices are equal. 2. **Consider the Diagonals and Symmetry:** Extend the diagonals (BE) and (FC). Since (ABCD) is such that opposite sides are parallel, the quadrilateral (FBCE) forms an isosceles trapezoid. This property implies that the line segment (MM_1), which connects the midpoints of the bases ((FB) and (CE)), is perpendicular to (FB) and (CE) and also serves as a bisector of the angle between diagonals (BE) and (FC). 3. **Establishing Midpoints and Perpendicularity:** Similarly, consider the lines (NN_1) and (LL_1) connecting the midpoints of the other parallel sides of the hexagon. Each of these lines will be perpendicular to the pairs of diagonals that they intersect and will serve as the angle bisectors for the respective pairs of diagonals. 4. **Finding Intersection Point:** Since (MM_1), (NN_1), and (LL_1) are each perpendicular to pairs of diagonals and bisect the angles formed by these diagonals, they will intersect at a single point (O). 5. **Equidistance from Vertices:** By the properties of the isosceles trapezoid and the bisectors, the point (O) is equidistant from each of the vertices of the hexagon (A, B, C, D, E,) and (F).

Thus, Z can be expressed as: Z = 73 times 137 times (1000a + 100b + 10c + d). This expression shows that Z is divisible by 73 and 137, and particularly by 10001.

Since f(x) is an even function, its zeros should be symmetric about the y-axis, implying that x = 0 is the unique zero point. Consequently, we have a_{n+1} - (2a_n + 1) = 0, which simplifies to a_{n+1} + 1 = 2(a_n + 1). This reveals that {a_n + 1} is an arithmetic sequence with a first term (a_1 + 1) = 2 and a common ratio 2. Thus, its general term can be found, leading to n(a_n + 1) = n2^n, which we can sum using the telescoping series method. **Step-by-step solution:** 1. The function f(x) = x^4 + a_{n+1}cos(2x) - (2a_n + 1) is an even function. 2. Since f(x) has a unique zero point, it must be symmetric about the y-axis, and x = 0 is the unique zero point. 3. Substituting x = 0 in f(x) gives a_{n+1} - (2a_n + 1) = 0. 4. Rearranging the above equation, we get a_{n+1} + 1 = 2(a_n + 1). 5. This implies that {a_n + 1} is an arithmetic sequence with a first term (a_1 + 1) = 2 and a common ratio 2. 6.

Thus, the radius r of the circle is frac{ssqrt{3}}{2}. - The circle rolls along side AB, remaining tangent to it at point T. 2. **Position of Points M and N**: - As the circle rolls, it intersects line AC at point M and line BC at point N. - Since the circle is tangent to AB at T, and T is a point on AB, the center of the circle, say O, will always be at a perpendicular distance r from AB. 3. **Arc MTN Analysis**: - The key to solving the problem is to determine the measure of arc MTN as the circle rolls. - Consider the triangle formed by points M, N, and O (the center of the circle). Since OM = ON = r, triangle MON is isosceles. - The angle at O, angle MON, subtends arc MTN on the circle. 4. **Calculating angle MON**: - Since ABC is equilateral, each angle in ABC is 60^circ. - The circle's center O lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB, and thus, it is equidistant from A and B. - As the circle rolls, the perpendicular from O to AB (which is the radius r) remains constant, and thus, the circle's center O moves along a line parallel to AB at a distance r. - The angle angle MON is half of 60^circ (since O is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the radius and the altitude of the triangle), which is 30^circ. 5. **Conclusion**: - Since angle MON = 30^circ, the arc MTN subtended by this angle in a circle is twice the angle, which is 60^circ. - This measure does not change regardless of the position of T along AB, as the geometric relationships remain constant due to the symmetry and constant radius of the circle.

Given that the number 999,999 needs to be multiplied by the smallest natural number mathrm{N} to yield a number consisting entirely of ones, let's express 999,999 in a simpler form: [ 999999 = 10^6 - 1 ] 2. A number consisting of n ones can be written as: [ frac{1}{9}(10^n - 1) ] 3. To find mathrm{N} such that multiplying 999,999 by mathrm{N} yields a number formed entirely of ones, set up the equation: [ (10^6 - 1) cdot mathrm{N} = frac{10^n - 1}{9} ] Solving for mathrm{N} gives: [ mathrm{N} = frac{1}{9} cdot frac{10^n - 1}{10^6 - 1} ] 4. Now, observe that if n = 6k + r, then the expression 10^n - 1 can be broken down as: [ 10^n - 1 = (10^{6k+r} - 10^r) + 10^r - 1 ] The first part of the expression is divisible by 10^6 - 1, so 10^n - 1 is divisible by 10^6 - 1 if and only if 10^r - 1 = 0, implying r = 0. Thus: [ n = 6k ] 5. Substituting n = 6k into the expression for mathrm{N}: [ mathrm{N} = frac{1}{9} cdot frac{10^{6k} - 1}{10^6 - 1} = frac{1}{9} cdot (10^{6k-6} + 10^{6k-12} + ldots + 10^6 + 1) ] 6. The sum inside the parentheses is a geometric series with k terms. For mathrm{N} to be an integer, the sum must be divisible by 9, since it consists of powers of 10 and ones, where each term contributes to the sum of digits being k. Therefore, k must be 9 (since it is the smallest number satisfying the conditions). 7. Hence, the smallest k is 9, meaning n = 54: [ n = 6 times 9 = 54 ] 8. Finally, calculate mathrm{N} using: [ mathrm{N} = frac{1}{9} cdot (10^{48} + 10^{42} + 10^{36} + 10^{30} + 10^{24} + 10^{18} + 10^{12} + 10^6 + 1) ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{N = 111112} ]"},{"prompt":"Which of the following statements is incorrect?

D: If two numbers are opposite numbers to each other, then their opposite numbers are also opposite numbers to each other.","completion":"To determine which statement is incorrect, let's analyze each option step by step: **Option A:** The statement claims that only two numbers with opposite signs are opposite numbers to each other. However, being opposite numbers involves more than just having opposite signs; they also need to have the same absolute value but different signs. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate as it oversimplifies the definition of opposite numbers. This makes option A the incorrect statement. **Option B:** To verify if -frac{11}{5} and 2.2 are opposite numbers, we convert 2.2 into a fraction to compare it directly with -frac{11}{5}. We find that 2.2 = frac{22}{10} = frac{11}{5}. Since one is the negative of the other, -frac{11}{5} and frac{11}{5} (or 2.2) are indeed opposite numbers. This means the statement in option B is correct. **Option C:** The process of making a number its opposite involves adding a \\"-\\" sign in front of the number if it's positive, or removing the \\"-\\" sign if it's negative. This changes the sign of the number, making it the opposite. Therefore, the statement in option C is correct. **Option D:** If two numbers are opposite numbers to each other, their opposites will also be opposites to each other. This is because taking the opposite of an opposite brings you back to the original number.

Therefore, the power of ( O ) with respect to ( (AA_1A_3) ) is ( OA^2 = r^2 ), where ( r ) is the radius of ( (ABC) ). - By a similar argument, it can be shown that the power of ( O ) with respect to ( (BB_1B_3) ) and ( (CC_1C_3) ) is also ( r^2 ). Therefore, ( O ) has equal power with respect to all three circles. - Since ( O ) and ( H ) both have equal powers with respect to all three circles, the Euler line ( OH ) of ( triangle ABC ) must be the radical axis of these three coaxial circles.

Thus, ( f(x_1) > f(x_2) ): [ text{Monotonicity: } f(x) text{ is decreasing in } (0, sqrt[4]{frac{b}{a}}). ] Likewise, for ( x_1, x_2 in (sqrt[4]{frac{b}{a}}, +infty) ) with ( x_1 < x_2 ), the function is increasing since the expression above will be positive. Moreover, being an even function, ( f(x) ) displays symmetry about the y-axis: [ text{Monotonicity: } f(x) text{ is decreasing in } (-infty, -sqrt[4]{frac{b}{a}}) text{ and increasing in } (-sqrt[4]{frac{b}{a}}, 0) text{ and increasing in } (0, +infty). ] 5. **Graph**: For the specific case ( f(x) = frac{1}{4} x^2 + frac{4}{x^2} ): [ a = frac{1}{4}, quad b = 4 ] The minimum value is: [ 2 sqrt{ab} = 2 sqrt{frac{1}{4} cdot 4} = 2 ] The function's graph will have its minimum value at ( x = pm sqrt[4]{frac{4}{1/4}} = pm sqrt[4]{16} = pm 2 ).

Each number a_i in the set is either +1 or -1. Our goal is to show that after repeated transformations, we will eventually obtain a set consisting solely of 1s. 1. **Initial Setup:** Given the set {a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_N}, each a_i in {+1, -1}. 2. **First Transformation:** We define the new set {a_1', a_2', ldots, a_N'} as: [ begin{aligned} a_1' &= a_1 a_2, a_2' &= a_2 a_3, &vdots a_{N-1}' &= a_{N-1} a_N, a_N' &= a_N a_1. end{aligned} ] Each a_i' is the product of adjacent elements in the original set, extended cyclically such that a_N wraps around to be multiplied by a_1. 3. **Iterative Transformation Process:** We repeat the transformation process. Notice: [ a_1'' = a_1' a_2' = (a_1 a_2)(a_2 a_3) = a_1 (a_2^2) a_3 = a_1 a_3, ] since a_2^2 = 1 because a_2 in {+1, -1}.

Specifically, after 2^k transformations (since N = 2^k): [ begin{aligned} a_1^{(2^k)} &= a_1 cdot a_1 = a_1^2 = 1, a_2^{(2^k)} &= a_2 cdot a_2 = a_2^2 = 1, &vdots a_N^{(2^k)} &= a_N cdot a_N = a_N^2 = 1. end{aligned} ] Since we are performing these multiplications recursively and cyclically, the elements are getting multiplied with every other element in such a manner that eventually each a_i gets squared after 2^k steps. Given that a_i in {+1, -1}, we have a_i^2 = 1 for all i.

So the eccentricity is e_1 = frac{sqrt{64-16}}{8} = frac{sqrt{48}}{8} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Since the hyperbola shares a common focus with the ellipse and their eccentricities are reciprocal, the eccentricity of the hyperbola e_2 satisfies e_1 cdot e_2 = 1, thus e_2 = frac{2}{sqrt{3}}. - The distance from the center to the focus (c) for the hyperbola is the same as that of the ellipse, which is c = 4sqrt{3}. - Now, we have e = frac{c}{a} for the hyperbola, and since e = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} and c = 4sqrt{3}, we solve for a: frac{2}{sqrt{3}} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{a} which implies a = 6.

Each E_{ell} is composed of edges “added at the ell-th step” (using recursion for ell). Each time we add a path P subseteq F_{j}, it helps us at the next step to construct paths added to other F_{i}, i.e., if necessary, we connect endpoints x, y of edges in P through x F_{i} y.

Otherwise, adding edge x y to F_{i} still keeps F_{i} a forest. Consider a sequence e_{1}, P_{1}, e_{2}, P_{2}, e_{3}, ldots where e_{1}=x y and P_{q}=P(e_{q}) and e_{q+1}=e(P_{q}). Since for all e in bigcup_{ell=1}^{n} E_{ell}, P(e) is uniquely defined, and for each P in mathcal{P}_{n}, e(P) is uniquely defined, this sequence must end at edge e^{*}. Because for all q, ell(e_{q})=ell(P_{q}) > ell(e_{q+1}), this sequence certainly terminates. In this process, starting e_{1} added into F_{i}, then recursively remove e_{q} from the forest F_{j} containing P_{q} while inserting e_{q+1}. Since P_{q}+e_{q+1} forms a cycle, the operation preserves the forest property. This construction yields a new edge-disjoint spanning forest family left(F_{1}, ldots, F_{k} right).

Evidently, the paths for ell = 1 exist. To prove the inductive step for ell = m > 1, let v in U_{m-1} and i in {1, ldots, k }. By induction, a path Q subseteq F_{j} cap H_{m-1} exists, where each edge in Q belongs to some E_{ell-1}. Hence mathcal{P}_{ell} contains paths u F_{i} v. Replacing edges in Q with these paths transforms Q into a F_{i} cap H_{m} v-x^{*} path. 7.

Step 1: Determine the condition for the inequality to be satisfied - We know that in order for the original proposition to be false, we need x^{2}-mx+4＞0 for all x＞frac{1}{2}. This implies that m must be less than the minimum value of the expression (x+frac{4}{x}) for x＞frac{1}{2}. This leads to the condition m＜{(x+frac{4}{x})}_{min}. Step 2: Find the minimum value of (x+frac{4}{x}) - We use the AM-GM inequality to find the minimum of (x+frac{4}{x}). According to AM-GM, for any two positive numbers a and b, it holds that frac{a+b}{2}≥sqrt{ab}, with equality when a=b. - Applying this to x+frac{4}{x}, we get frac{x+frac{4}{x}}{2}≥sqrt{x•frac{4}{x}}, which simplifies to x+frac{4}{x}≥4.

There is no carry from the second column to the first, confirming that A + C = D. 3. **Consider the implications for C:** - The second column gives us A + B = C.

Here, we need to adapt this theorem to the context of subsets. 3. **Constructing a Sequence Without a Good Subsequence:** Consider the sequence of subsets of ( X ) where each subset is of size 50 or 49. Specifically, we can construct a sequence of subsets as follows: [ X_{50} oplus X_{49} oplus X_{51} oplus X_{50} ] where ( X_k ) denotes the set of all subsets of ( X ) of size ( k ), and ( oplus ) denotes concatenation. This sequence avoids any good subsequences and has size ( 2binom{100}{50} + 2binom{100}{49} ). 4. **Bounding ( n ):** To show that ( n leq 2binom{100}{50} + 2binom{100}{49} ), we use the following lemma: **Lemma:** Any sequence of subsets of ( X ) contains at most 4 elements from each chain in the poset of subsets of ( X ) ordered by inclusion. **Proof of Lemma:** Suppose there are 5 elements in a chain. By the Erdős–Szekeres theorem, there must be either an increasing or decreasing subsequence of length 3, which contradicts our assumption. Hence, any chain can contain at most 4 elements from the sequence. (blacksquare) 5. **Chain Decomposition:** We need to construct a chain decomposition of the poset ( P ) of subsets of ( X ) such that each chain contains elements from levels 49, 50, and 51. This is achieved using a symmetric chain decomposition. **Symmetric Chain Decomposition:** A symmetric chain decomposition of a Boolean lattice ( B_m ) (the poset of subsets of a set with ( m ) elements) is a partition of the lattice into chains such that each chain goes from level ( k ) to level ( m-k ) for some ( k ). **Construction:** - For ( m = 1 ), the decomposition is trivial. - Assume we have a symmetric chain decomposition for ( B_m ). - For each chain ( C_i: c_1 subseteq c_2 subseteq cdots subseteq c_r ) in ( B_m ), add the chains: [ c_1 subseteq c_2 subseteq cdots subseteq c_{r-1} subseteq c_r cup {m+1} ] and if ( r geq 2 ), [ c_1 cup {m+1} subseteq c_2 cup {m+1} subseteq cdots subseteq c_{r-1} cup {m+1} ] - These new chains form a symmetric chain decomposition of ( B_{m+1} ). 6. **Conclusion:** Using the symmetric chain decomposition, we can show that the maximum number of subsets in a sequence without a good subsequence is ( 2binom{100}{50} + 2binom{100}{49} ). Therefore, the smallest ( n ) satisfying the condition is: [ n = 2binom{100}{50} + 2binom{100}{49} + 1 ] The final answer is ( boxed{2binom{100}{50} + 2binom{100}{49} + 1} )"},{"prompt":"Find the least positive integer x that satisfies x + 7813 equiv 2500 pmod{15}.","completion":"1.

We need to find a^2 + b^2 + c^2 under the constraints a geq 1 and a + b + c leq 7. 2. **Analyzing the Odometer Readings:** The difference in the odometer readings, which is the distance traveled, is given by: [ 100c + 10b + a - (100a + 10b + c) = 99c - 99a = 99(c - a) ] Since the speed is 55 mph and the time is a whole number of hours, the distance must be a multiple of 55. Therefore, 99(c - a) must be divisible by 55. This implies that c - a must be divisible by 5 (since 99 and 55 share a common factor of 11). 3. **Considering the Constraints:** Since c - a is divisible by 5 and a + b + c leq 7 with a geq 1, we consider possible values for a and c: - If a = 1, then c could be 6 (as 6 - 1 = 5 is divisible by 5). - Other values for a and c either do not satisfy c - a divisible by 5 or exceed the sum limit of 7. 4. **Determining the Value of b:** With a = 1 and c = 6, we have a + c = 7.

The conversion factor from kmph to m/s is: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 36 kmph * (1000 meters / 3600 seconds) = 10 m/s Now, we know the speed of the train (10 m/s) and the time it takes to cross the bridge (27.997760179185665 seconds).

The difference between the longest and shortest diagonal lengths is less than the side length. 3. **General Formula for Diagonal Lengths**: - For ( n > 7 ), a regular ( n )-gon has side length ( 2R sin (pi/n) ), where ( R ) is the radius of the circumcircle. - The shortest diagonal length is ( 2R sin (2pi/n) ). - The longest diagonal length differs for even and odd ( n ): - If ( n ) is even, it is ( 2R ). - If ( n ) is odd, it is ( 2R cos (pi/2n) ). 4. **Solving for Difference Equal to the Side Length**: - We need to have the equation ( sin (2pi/n) + sin (pi/n) = 1 ) if ( n ) is even or ( sin (2pi/n) + sin (pi/n) = cos (pi/2n) ) if ( n ) is odd. 5. **Analyzing the Equations**: - The left-hand side (LHS) of these equations are strictly decreasing functions of ( n ). - The right-hand side (RHS) is an increasing function (for the ( cos (pi/2n) )). 6. **Finding the Solution for Odd ( n )**: - Solving ( sin (2pi/n) + sin (pi/n) = cos (pi/2n) ) for ( n = 9 ): [ sin (2pi/9) + sin (pi/9) = cos (pi/18) ] This equation holds true for ( n = 9 ). It is confirmed that for ( n = 9 ), the configuration with the longest and shortest diagonals forming a pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral and 9-gon sides forming the other pair meets the condition. 7. **Checking Even ( n )**: - For ( n = 8 ): [ sin (2pi/8) + sin (pi/8) = 2sin (pi/4) + sin (pi/8) = 1.414 + 0.383 < 1 ] This difference is less than 1. - For ( n = 10 ): [ sin (2 pi/10) + sin (pi/10) = sin (pi/5) (2 cos (pi/10) + 1) ] [ 2 cos (pi/10) + 1 < 3 ] [ 3 sin (pi/10) < 1 ] Hence, there are no solutions for ( n geq 10 ) if ( n ) is even. 8. **Conclusion**: The only possible value of ( n ) that meets the requirement is ( n = 9 ).

To find the area of quadrilateral (ABCD), consider rotating the triangle (AED) anticlockwise by (90^circ) about point (A). 3. When (AED) is rotated by (90^circ), point (D) overlaps the position of point (C), and point (E) rotates to a new position such that it forms a square. Let’s explain how this forms a square. 4. Initially, (angle EAD = 90^circ). After rotation: - Point (A) stays fixed. - Point (E) rotates to a position along the line (AD). - Point (D) rotates to the position of point (C) because (D) was originally along (AD) and (angle DAC = angle DAB = 90^circ). 5.

The probability that A and C must be adjacent while B and E cannot be adjacent is ______.","completion":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down into manageable steps, following the guidelines provided in the solution. **Step 1: Calculate the total number of possibilities.** Since there are 5 students and each of them can stand in any of the 5 positions, the total number of arrangements is the permutation of 5 objects taken 5 at a time, which is calculated as: [P(5, 5) = 5! = 120] **Step 2: Consider A and C as a single entity and calculate the possibilities.** - **Case 1:** A and C are at the beginning of the row. In this scenario, B and E cannot be adjacent and can only occupy positions 2 and 4. The number of ways to arrange B and E in these positions is P(2, 2) = 2! = 2. The remaining position is automatically filled by D. Thus, the total number of arrangements in this case is 2 times 2 = 4. - **Case 2:** A and C are at the end of the row. Similar to Case 1, B and E can only be in positions 1 and 3, which also gives P(2, 2) = 2! = 2 arrangements. The total for this case is also 4. - **Case 3:** A and C are in the middle positions (2 and 3 or 3 and 4). In these scenarios, B and E have two sets of positions they can occupy: either 1 and 4, or 1 and 3 (when A and C are in 2 and 3), and similarly for when A and C are in 3 and 4. Each of these gives P(2, 2) = 2! = 2 arrangements. Since there are two ways to place A and C in the middle, the total for this case is 2 times 2 times 2 = 8. **Step 3: Calculate the total number of valid arrangements.** Adding the possibilities from all cases, we get: [4 + 4 + 8 = 16] However, we must account for the two arrangements of A and C themselves in each scenario, which doubles the total number of valid arrangements to 16 times 2 = 32. **Step 4: Calculate the probability.** The probability that A and C must be adjacent while B and E cannot be adjacent is the ratio of the number of valid arrangements to the total number of possibilities: [frac{32}{120} = frac{8}{30} = frac{4}{15}] However, upon reviewing the calculation, it appears there was an oversight in the interpretation of the original solution's final step. The correct interpretation should follow the original solution's calculation for the total number of valid arrangements, which was 6 times 2 times 2 = 24.

The reaction is a neutralization reaction, and the products are water (H2O) and sodium phosphate (Na3PO4). The balanced chemical equation is: H3PO4 + 3NaOH → Na3PO4 + 3H2O From the balanced equation, we can see that 1 mole of H3PO4 reacts with 3 moles of NaOH to produce 3 moles of H2O. Now, let's determine the limiting reactant: We have 2.5 moles of H3PO4 and 3 moles of NaOH. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of H3PO4 requires 3 moles of NaOH. Therefore, 2.5 moles of H3PO4 would require 2.5 * 3 = 7.5 moles of NaOH to react completely. Since we only have 3 moles of NaOH, NaOH is the limiting reactant. Now, let's calculate the amount of H2O formed: Since NaOH is the limiting reactant, we will use its moles to calculate the amount of H2O produced. For every mole of NaOH, 1 mole of H2O is produced (according to the balanced equation). Therefore, 3 moles of NaOH will produce 3 moles of H2O. Finally, let's calculate the amount of unreacted H3PO4: Since NaOH is the limiting reactant, we need to find out how much H3PO4 is consumed by 3 moles of NaOH. According to the stoichiometry of the reaction, 3 moles of NaOH will react with 1 mole of H3PO4. Therefore, 3 moles of NaOH will react with 3/3 = 1 mole of H3PO4. We started with 2.5 moles of H3PO4, so the amount of unreacted H3PO4 is: 2.5 moles (initial) - 1 mole (reacted) = 1.5 moles of H3PO4 remaining unreacted.

We need to find the length of the line segment parallel to (a) and (b) that divides the trapezoid into two parts whose areas are in the ratio (p:q). 1. Let the dividing line create two trapezoids, where the height of the lower trapezoid is (y) and the height of the upper trapezoid is (m - y). 2. By properties of trapezoids and the problem's conditions, we have: [ frac{(a + x)y}{(x + b)(m - y)} = frac{q}{p} ] where (x) is the length of the segment parallel to (a) and (b). 3. We know the sum of the areas of these two trapezoids must equal the area of the original trapezoid: [ (a + x)y + (x + b)(m - y) = (a + b)m ] 4. Let's consider each part separately. The area constraint can be rewritten by first expanding and then simplifying: [ y(a + x) + (m - y)(x + b) = (a + b)m ] [ ya + yx + mx - yx + mb - yb = (a + b)m ] [ ya + mx - yb + mb = (a + b)m ] [ y(a - b) = m(a - x) ] Therefore, [ y = frac{m(a - x)}{a - b} ] 5. Similarly, for the upper part's height: [ m - y = frac{m(x - b)}{a - b} ] 6. Next, substitute these values of (y) and (m - y) into the area ratio equation: [ frac{y(a + x)}{(m - y)(x + b)} = frac{q}{p} ] Substituting (y = frac{m(a - x)}{a - b}) and (m - y = frac{m(x - b)}{a - b}): [ frac{left(frac{m(a - x)}{a - b}right)(a + x)}{left(frac{m(x - b)}{a - b}right)(x + b)} = frac{q}{p} ] Simplifying: [ frac{m(a - x)(a + x)}{m(x - b)(x + b)} = frac{q}{p} ] [ frac{(a - x)(a + x)}{(x - b)(x + b)} = frac{q}{p} ] 7. Recognize the difference of squares and simplify further: [ frac{a^2 - x^2}{x^2 - b^2} = frac{q}{p} ] 8.

Since the train stops for 18.67 minutes per hour, it is actually running for (60 - 18.67) minutes in an hour. Running time in minutes = 60 - 18.67 = 41.33 minutes Now, we convert the running time back to hours to find out how much distance the train covers in one hour including stoppages. Running time in hours = 41.33 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.68883 hours (approximately) The speed of the train without stoppages is 45 kmph, which means it covers 45 km in one hour. To find the distance covered including stoppages, we multiply the running time in hours by the speed: Distance covered including stoppages = Speed * Running time in hours Distance covered including stoppages = 45 kmph * 0.68883 hours Distance covered including stoppages ≈ 45 * 0.68883 km Distance covered including stoppages ≈ 31 km (rounded to the nearest whole number) Now, to find the speed of the train including stoppages, we take the distance covered including stoppages and divide it by the total time in hours (which is 1 hour, since we are considering the speed per hour).

An axis-parallel rectangle has sides parallel to the grid lines. 2. **Initial Considerations:** - If there is no row with 3 or more red squares, the maximum number of red squares is at most 10. This is because if each row has at most 2 red squares, we can have at most 2 times 5 = 10 red squares. - We need to consider cases where rows have more than 2 red squares to potentially increase the number of red squares. 3. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1: First row has 4 red squares.** - If the first row has 4 red squares, then each of the remaining rows can have at most 1 of these 4 squares to avoid forming an axis-parallel rectangle. - Additionally, each of the remaining rows can have one more red square that is not in the same column as any of the 4 red squares in the first row. - This gives us 4 red squares in the first row and 1 additional red square in each of the remaining 4 rows, totaling 4 + 4 = 8 red squares. - However, we can place 2 additional red squares in each of the remaining rows, giving us 4 + 2 times 4 = 12 red squares. - **Case 2: First row has 3 red squares.** - If the first row has 3 red squares, the second row can also have 3 red squares. - To avoid forming an axis-parallel rectangle, the remaining rows can have at most 2 red squares each, ensuring that no two rows share more than one column with red squares. - This gives us 3 red squares in the first row, 3 in the second row, and 2 in each of the remaining 3 rows, totaling 3 + 3 + 2 times 3 = 12 red squares. 4. **Verification:** - **Case 3: First row has 5 red squares.** - If the first row has 5 red squares, each of the remaining rows can have at most 1 red square to avoid forming an axis-parallel rectangle. - This gives us 5 red squares in the first row and 1 in each of the remaining 4 rows, totaling 5 + 4 = 9 red squares, which is less than 12. 5. **Conclusion:** - From the above cases, the maximum number of red squares that can be colored without forming an axis-parallel rectangle is 12.

This implies that the polynomial ( P(x) ) must generate a set of values such that there is a gap around the integer ( b ). Specifically, ( P(x) ) cannot produce the value ( b ), but can produce values as close to ( b ) as possible from both sides. 3. Consider the polynomial ( P(x) = (x-3)(x-1)(x+1)(x+3) ). Let’s verify that this polynomial meets the given condition: - The degree of ( P(x) ) is 4, which is an even number. - Notice that the polynomial ( P(x) ) is symmetric with respect to ( x ). 4.

Therefore, we have f(-1) = 2f'(1), which means option A is correct. **Option B:** First, we find the values of f(1), f'(1), f(0), and f(2): - Setting x = -1 in f(2+x) = 4 - f(-x), we get f(1) = 2. - From 2f'(1) = 2f(0) = f(1), we have f'(1) = 1, f(0) = 1. - Substituting x = 0 in f(2+x) = 4 - f(-x), we find f(2) = 3.

To find the area of the circumcircle of triangle ( C_1 B A_1 ), we first need to establish that triangles ( C_1 B A_1 ) and ( C B A ) are similar. 2. The triangles are similar because both ( C_1 ) and ( A_1 ) are the feet of the altitudes from ( C ) and ( A ) to the opposite sides ( AB ) and ( BC ), respectively. Therefore, the angles ( angle C_1 B A_1 ) and ( angle C B A ) are congruent, leading to similarity by AA similarity criterion. 3. Given the similarity, the scaling factor between triangles ( C_1 B A_1 ) and ( C B A ) is ( cos beta ), where ( beta = angle B ). We are informed that: [ beta = 90^circ - alpha ] Hence, [ cos beta = cos (90^circ - alpha) = sin alpha ] 4.

Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that all three angles in the triangle are greater than 60 degrees. 2. Let the three angles be A, B, and C, then according to the assumption, we have A > 60^circ, B > 60^circ, and C > 60^circ. 3. The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180^circ. So, we can write an equation for the sum of angles: A + B + C = 180^circ 4.

A natural number ( n ) is called good if for every natural divisor ( d ) of ( n ), the number ( d+1 ) is a divisor of ( n+1 ). 2. First, we note that ( n = 1 ) satisfies the given condition. The divisor of 1 is just 1, and (1+1=2), which divides (1+1). Therefore, ( n = 1 ) is a good number. 3. Next, consider that all odd prime numbers are good. Suppose ( n = p ), where ( p ) is an odd prime number. The divisors of ( p ) are 1 and ( p ). Then [ (1+1) = 2 quad text{and} quad (p+1) ] are the divisors of ( p+1 ). 4. We need to confirm that both 2 and ( p+1 ) divide ( p+1 ). Clearly, both 2 and ( p+1 ) divide ( p+1 ) exactly, confirming that all odd prime numbers satisfy the condition. 5. To further restrict our search, we note that for any number ( n ) satisfying the condition, ( n+1 ) must be even, because ( 1+1 = 2 ) must divide ( n+1 ). This implies that ( n ) must be odd. 6. Now let's consider if there could be any composite ( n ) that satisfies the condition. Suppose ( n ) is composite and can be written as ( n = a cdot b ), where ( a geq b geq 2 ). 7. Since ( a ) and ( b ) are divisors of ( n ), both ( a+1 ) and ( b+1 ) need to be divisors of ( n+1 ). This implies that: [ n + 1 equiv 0 pmod{a+1} quad text{and} quad n + 1 equiv 0 pmod{b+1} ] In other words, ( n+1 ) is divisible by both ( a+1 ) and ( b+1 ). 8. Suppose additionally that ( n = k cdot (a+1) + r ) where ( r < a+1 ). Since ( n+1 equiv 0 pmod{a+1} ), ( r = a+1 - 1 = a ). 9. Analyzing further, we find: [ n = (a+1) - 1 = a ] and considering it must fit ( n=n-b=(a+1)b-a+1 ), [ b-1 geq a-1, ] but since ( n ) must have both conditions ( b-1 geq a+1 ), it causes complication 10.

For the first platform (350 m), the total distance covered by the train is ( L + 350 ) meters, and it takes 15 seconds to cross it.

The speed of the train is the same in both cases, so we can write: [ S = frac{L + 500}{20} ] Since the speed of the train is the same in both cases, we can set the two expressions for ( S ) equal to each other: [ frac{L + 350}{15} = frac{L + 500}{20} ] Now, we can solve for ( L ) by cross-multiplying: [ 20(L + 350) = 15(L + 500) ] [ 20L + 7000 = 15L + 7500 ] Subtract ( 15L ) from both sides: [ 5L + 7000 = 7500 ] Subtract ( 7000 ) from both sides: [ 5L = 500 ] Divide both sides by 5: [ L = 100 ] Therefore, the length of the train is boxed{100} meters."},{"prompt":"the geometric sequence {a_n}, if a_5 + a_6 + a_7 + a_8 = frac{15}{8} and a_6a_7 = frac{9}{8}, then find the value of frac{1}{a_5} + frac{1}{a_6} + frac{1}{a_7} + frac{1}{a_8}.","completion":"By the properties of a geometric sequence, we can obtain a_5a_8 = a_6a_7 = -frac{9}{8}.

For a point (x, y) and a circle of radius R centered at (h, k), the power of the point is given by: P(x, y) = (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 - R^2. 3. Applying this formula to our given circles: - The power of the point (x, y) with respect to the circle S_1 is: P_1(x, y) = (x + a)^2 + y^2 - R_1^2. - The power of the point (x, y) with respect to the circle S_2 is: P_2(x, y) = (x - a)^2 + y^2 - R_2^2. 4.

Assume that (a, b, c) are integers and that the sides (a, b,) and (c) are pairwise coprime, i.e., (gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, c) = gcd(c, a) = 1). 2. **Expression for the Area in Two Ways**: The area of the triangle can be expressed in two different ways: - From the legs: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2}ab ] - From the height (H) dropped to the hypotenuse (c): [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2}cH ] 3. **Equating the Two Expressions**: Since both expressions represent the same area, set them equal to each other: [ frac{1}{2}ab = frac{1}{2}cH ] 4. **Simplifying the Equation**: Cancel out the (frac{1}{2}) on both sides: [ ab = cH ] 5. **Analyzing the Relation**: We need to show that (H) cannot be an integer. We leverage the fact that (a, b,) and (c) are pairwise coprime. Since (a) and (b) are coprime, (ab) has no prime factors in common with (a) or (b), individually. Hence, if (c) is coprime with both (a) and (b), then (c) is also coprime with (ab). 6. **Applying Integer Property**: Given (ab = cH) and knowing that (c) (being coprime with (ab)) must divide (ab) if (H) were an integer, (c) must divide (H). However, since (c) divides (ab) and (c) is coprime to both (a) and (b), (c) must be equal to (1) for (cH) to remain an integer without violating the pairwise coprimeness. However, since (c) is the hypotenuse and hence a non-trivial integer, (c neq 1). 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, (H) cannot be precisely divisible by (c) and hence (H) cannot be an integer if (a, b,) and (c) are pairwise coprime.

We use the sine and cosine angle addition formulas: sin(x+1) cos x - cos(x+1) sin x = sin(1) 5.

(For example, a 180^{circ} rotation, followed by a reflection across the xaxis, followed by a reflection across the yaxis will return T to its original position, but a 90^{circ} rotation, followed by a reflection across the xaxis, followed by another reflection across the xaxis will not return T to its original position.) textbf{(A) } 12 qquad textbf{(B) } 15 qquad textbf{(C) } 17 qquad textbf{(D) } 20 qquad textbf{(E) } 25","completion":"We are given a triangle T with vertices at (0,0), (4,0), and (0,3) and asked to determine how many sequences of three transformations from the set of rotations by 90^circ, 180^circ, 270^circ counterclockwise around the origin, and reflections across the x-axis and y-axis, will return T to its original position. Step 1: Understand the transformations - **Rotation by 90^circ counterclockwise** about the origin sends (x,y) to (-y,x). - **Rotation by 180^circ counterclockwise** about the origin sends (x,y) to (-x,-y). - **Rotation by 270^circ counterclockwise** about the origin sends (x,y) to (y,-x). - **Reflection across the x-axis** sends (x,y) to (x,-y). - **Reflection across the y-axis** sends (x,y) to (-x,y). Step 2: Consider the effect of transformations on orientation Reflections change the orientation of the triangle, while rotations preserve it. To return T to its original position, the net effect of the transformations must preserve orientation. Thus, the number of reflections in the sequence must be even (either 0 or 2). Case 1: No reflections We use only rotations. The sum of the angles of rotation must be a multiple of 360^circ to return T to its original position. We can choose any two rotations, and the third must be the one that makes the total rotation 360^circ. - If we choose two 90^circ rotations, the third must be 180^circ. - If we choose two 180^circ rotations, the third must be 0^circ (equivalent to no rotation, which is not allowed). - If we choose two 270^circ rotations, the third must be 90^circ. - Other combinations are rotations of 90^circ and 270^circ, 90^circ and 180^circ, and 180^circ and 270^circ. Calculating valid combinations: - (90^circ, 90^circ, 180^circ) - (90^circ, 270^circ, 0^circ) (not allowed) - (90^circ, 180^circ, 90^circ) - (180^circ, 270^circ, 270^circ) - (270^circ, 270^circ, 90^circ) - (180^circ, 180^circ, 0^circ) (not allowed) There are 4 valid combinations, each of which can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. However, we must exclude cases where the third rotation is 0^circ. Thus, we have 6 valid sequences. Case 2: Two reflections We must use one reflection about the x-axis and one about the y-axis, and one rotation. The only rotation that can be combined with these two reflections to return T to its original position is 180^circ, as it negates both x and y coordinates. The sequence can be any permutation of these three transformations. There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange one 180^circ rotation, one reflection across the x-axis, and one reflection across the y-axis. Conclusion Adding the valid sequences from both cases, we have 6 + 6 = 12 sequences that return T to its original position. boxed{textbf{(A)} 12}"},{"prompt":"Given that the function y=f(x) is a decreasing function on mathbb{R}, if f(a) geq f(2), then the range of values for a is ( ) A: a leq 2 B: a geq 2 C: a geq 2 D: a leq 2","completion":"Since y=f(x) is a decreasing function on mathbb{R} and f(a) geq f(-2), it follows that a leq -2.

We start by dividing the matrix into smaller rectangular blocks such that each block at least has one element on the main diagonal. Each block will be labeled as (R_i) if it contains elements from the (i)-th row and as (C_i) if it contains elements from the (i)-th column. 2. **Expressing the Perimeter**: For a block (R_i), it occupies at least two segments of the (i)-th row and for a block (C_i), it similarly occupies two segments of the (i)-th column.

Claim: The game is winnable if and only if there are at most 2n dividers. **Case 1: More than 2n Dividers** - **Proof**: - Each move only removes one divider. - If there are more than 2n dividers initially, after 2n moves, there will still be dividers remaining, thus, it is impossible to win.

(one less divider, zigzags merge). - ...STSTS... becomes ...S | S...

By the end of 2n moves, no dividers should remain, ensuring victory. Hence, whether Tasty or Stacy starts first, they can adaptively follow moves based on the remaining structure to win the game.

All dice are 1's: There is only 1 way for this to happen. 2.

Let's denote the total set ( X ) as containing ( n = 100 ) elements. 2. According to the problem, we need to find 1111 distinct subsets (let's call this collection of subsets ( mathcal{C} )) where for any A, B in mathcal{C} with A ne B, the intersection A cap B has a number of elements that is a perfect square. 3. Consider the possible sizes of the intersection of any two subsets. The perfect squares less than or equal to the number of elements in ( X ) are ( 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, ) and ( 100 ). 4. Now, let's observe that the size of (mathcal{C}) (which is 1111) is larger than the sum of the first few natural numbers when squared. The largest perfect square that fits within 100 is (100). 5. We should apply the Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem, which tells us something about the intersection of subsets in certain sizes, but here we're interested in the stronger property of intersections being fixed perfect squares rather than a particular size. 6. Initially, consider the complexity of each subset in ( mathcal{C} ) having intersections restricted to these squares. Substantially increasing ( |mathcal{C}| ) under these constraints becomes infeasible, especially considering that intersections growing large rapidly violate the combinatorial limits. 7. For practical verification, let’s count how we might achieve a simpler case: - The maximum number of subsets we can form where each possible subset intersection is one specific perfect square without repetition or overlap. - Utilizing a naive upper bound, subsets generating pairs with chosen perfect square sizes significantly reduce the possibility of forming a large enough collection (mathcal{C}) due to double-counting intersections as squared terms grow. 8. Determining ( | mathcal{C} | ) directly by bounded attempts inspects whether possible intersections abstractly limit to available perfect square counts. 9. Hence, if we assume 1111 unique intersections fitting required combinatorial constructions, the complexity vastly breaks theoretical bounds for n = 100: 1111 > binom{100}{2} due to space and intersection limitation. # Conclusion: Thus, it is not feasible to have 1111 distinct subsets where the intersection of any two subsets results in a perfect square.

Let the area and perimeter of (X) be denoted as (S(X)) and (P(X)) respectively, and the area and perimeter of (Y) be (S(Y)) and (P(Y)) respectively. 2. **Intermediate Step: Constructing Rectangles Inside Polygon** Begin by noting that for any convex polygon with area (S) and perimeter (P), a circle with radius (frac{S}{P}) can be inscribed within this polygon. This involves constructing, along the sides of the polygon (X), internal rectangles with one side of the rectangle being of length (R = frac{S(X)}{P(X)}) and the other side coinciding with a segment of the polygon's side. 3. **Argument based on Covering** These rectangles will cover portions of polygon (X) but won’t completely cover it due to overlaps and projections beyond the boundary. The total area covered by these rectangles equals the area of the polygon due to the sum of all such small rectangles' areas equating to (S(X)). Points within (X) not covered by these rectangles must be at a distance more than (R) from the edges of (X), thus a circle of radius (R) with any of these uncovered points as center will lie entirely inside (X). 4. **Containing the Circle in the Outer Polygon** We then see that this circle of radius (R) will be entirely within the polygon (X). Since (X) itself is contained within (Y), the same circle (with the same radius) lies within (Y), showing a significant relationship between these areas and perimeters. 5. **Maximum Radius in Terms of Area and Perimeter** Next, we show that if a circle of radius (R = frac{S(X)}{P(X)}) is inscribed in (X), then (R leq 2 cdot frac{S(Y)}{P(Y)}). Begin by joining the circle's center (O) to the vertices of polygon (Y), subdividing it into triangles each having areas ( frac{h_i a_i}{2} ), where (h_i) is the distance from the center (O) to the (i)-th side and (a_i) is the length of this side. 6. **Relation via Areas and Perimeters** Since (h_i geq R), it follows that (2S(X) = sum_{i} h_i a_i geq sum_{i} R a_i = R cdot P(X)).

We want to find the locus of points (X) such that the circumcircles of triangles (XAB) and (XCD) are tangent at (X). 2. **Applying the Radical Axis Theorem**: According to the Radical Axis Theorem, if two circles are tangent at a point (X), the tangents to both circles at (X) are the same. Hence, the radical axis of these two circles passes through the point (X). Additionally, the radical axis of the circumcircles can be determined using radical axes of the given pairs of points. 3. **Determining the Common Radical Center**: By considering the point of tangency (X), the tangents ( (TX)) and the lines ((AB)) and ((CD)) are concurrent at a fixed point (P), which is defined as the radical center of the system comprised of the circumcircles of (XAB) and (XCD). 4. **Relating Distances Using Power of a Point**: Using the power of point (P) with respect to the circumcircles (XAB) and (XCD), we have: [ PA cdot PB = PC cdot PD = PX^2 ] This relation tells us that the product of the tangents from (P) to points (A) and (B), as well as to points (C) and (D), is equal to the square of the length of the segment (PX). 5. **Deriving the Constant Quantity**: Since the points (A), (B), (C), and (D) are fixed, the quantities (PA cdot PB) and (PC cdot PD) are constant.

Here are the detailed cases: 1. **Case 1: No intersection points (0)**: - A line can have no intersection points with the boundary of the triangle if the line is completely outside the triangle and does not touch any of its sides. - Mathematically, this can be visualized with a line parallel to one of the triangle's sides but sufficiently far away from the triangle. 2. **Case 2: One intersection point (1)**: - This scenario occurs when the line is tangent to the triangle at exactly one of its vertices. - For a more detailed geometric description, consider a line that just grazes the triangle at a single point, the point of tangency is on the boundary, but no other points of intersection exist. 3. **Case 3: Two intersection points (2)**: - A line can intersect the boundary of a triangle at exactly two points. This situation occurs when a line crosses the triangle entering at one point and leaving at another. - This is a typical scenario and the most common one. The line slices through the triangle from one side to another. 4. **Case 4: Coincidence with a side (infty) or (x)**: - If the line coincides with one of the sides of the triangle exactly, then it intersects the boundary at infinitely many points along that segment. - This is considered as a special case leading to an infinite number of intersection points, but it’s often simplified in discussions to indicate the entire segment. Thus, the possible number of intersection points a line can have with the boundary of a triangle while lying in its plane are: 0, 1, 2, and x (where x indicates the possibility of an infinite number of points if the line lies along a side of the triangle). # Conclusion: The total number of points of intersection a line can have with the boundary of a triangle in its plane are: boxed{0, 1, 2, x}"},{"prompt":"Which of the following curves has the same eccentricity and asymptotes as the hyperbola frac{x^{2}}{3} y^{2} = 1?

The equation to solve is: [4x + 3y = 20.] We also want to maximize x + y, the total number of digits, to make the number as large as possible.

Among transgender cows, 45% have a unique pattern, 30% have both spots and horns, and 50% are black. In order to calculate the total number of cows with each special characteristic, find the number of spotted females, horned males, brown males, uniquely patterned transgender cows, and white horned females.

Therefore, dfrac{b^2}{a^2}= dfrac{1}{2}, which implies a^2=2b^2 (①). Since the foci of the ellipse are on the x-axis and it passes through point P(0,1), we have b=1 (②).

The ball starts from the bottom-left corner and is shot at a (45^circ) angle. 2. **Trajectory Analysis**: To simplify the complexity of dealing with multiple reflections, we employ a common trick in billiards problems: consider reflections of the table instead of the ball's trajectory. By reflecting the table across its sides, the ball's path can be represented as a straight line in an extended grid. 3. **Equation of the Path**: Since the ball starts at the origin ((0,0)) and moves at a (45^circ) angle, its trajectory in the coordinate system is represented by the equation of the line: [ y = x ] 4. **Identify the Extended Grid Coordinates**: - The original billiard table extends into an infinite grid of reflected tables. - Each reflected table can be considered as a new \\"block\\" ( (1965m, 26n) ), where (m) and (n) are integers representing the count of reflections horizontally and vertically, respectively. 5. **Intersection Points with Pockets**: - To determine when the ball lands in a pocket, we identify the pockets' coordinates: [ (1965m, 26n) ] - The bottom-left corner is ((0, 0)), the bottom-right is ((1965, 0)), the top-left is ((0, 26)), and the top-right is ((1965, 26)). 6. **Condition to Hit the Top-Left Pocket**: - We need the ball to be at coordinates where ( x = y ). - Since the trajectory is ( y = x ), this hits a canvas's vertex when: [ 1965m = 26n ] - Simplifying this, we get: [ frac{m}{n} = frac{26}{1965} = frac{2}{151} ] - Which implies ( m = 2k ) and ( n = 151k ) for some integer ( k ). 7. **Verifying the Pocket Condition**: - The top-left pocket in the original system corresponds to hitting a point where ( frac{m}{k} ) is even, and ( frac{n}{k} ) is odd (since ( (0, 26) ) or any point like ( (1965 times even, 26 times odd) )). - For our case ( k = 1 ): [ m = 2 quad text{(even)}, quad n = 151 quad text{(odd)} ] - Thus, the initial angle shot and reflections ensure that it eventually reaches the pocket after (2k) and (151k) reflections. 8. **Conclusion**: This means after multiple reflections, the ball will fall into the top-left pocket.

Placing 99 coins leaves exactly 101 empty cells. - Due to the adjacency restriction, every coin must be placed such that no other coin is in any of the 4 adjacent cells. Hence, at least one empty cell must separate any two coins horizontally or vertically. - Since 99 coins mean 101 empty cells and the grid having an even number of columns, we must consider the placement constraints. 3. **Analyzing Coin Placement Strategy and Empty Columns:** - One column (or two consecutive cells) on the (2 times 100) board must be entirely empty to satisfy the separation property. - The other cells can be arranged to obey the adjacency restriction. 4. **Counting Configurations:** - If we fix one column to be empty, there are (100 - 1 = 99) remaining columns where coins need to be placed. - For each column to the left of the empty column, there are exactly 2 possible valid configurations (patterns) for placing coins such that no coins are adjacent. Similarly, for each column to the right of the empty column, there are 2 possible valid configurations. - There are no restrictions on how columns left and right of the empty column interact, as the empty column ensures compliance with the adjacency rule. 5. **Case Analysis:** - If the empty column is not the extreme left or right, for each valid placement of columns to the left, there are 2 choices, and similarly, there are 2 choices to the right. Thus, (2 times 2 = 4) configurations. - However, if the empty column is either the extreme left or extreme right column, there are only 2 configurations possible for either placement case. 6. **Combining the Cases:** - There are 98 internal columns which can be empty, each contributing (4) configurations per fixed empty column. - Plus, two additional configurations arise from fixing the empty column to the extreme left or extreme right.

Since ( p_1 + 1 > 1 ), we must have ( p_1 + 1 = p_t ). This implies ( p_1 = 2 ) and ( p_t = 3 ), which is a contradiction since ( p_1 ) and ( p_t ) are distinct primes. (blacksquare) 4. **Claim 2:** If ( p_i + 1 ) is a power of 2 for some ( i ), then we are done. *Proof:* Suppose ( p_i + 1 = 2^k ) for some positive integer ( k ). Hence, ( p_i = 2^k - 1 ). If ( k ) is composite, let ( k = ab ) with ( a, b geq 2 ). Then: [ (2^a - 1) mid (2^{ab} - 1) = (2^k - 1) = p_i Rightarrow 2^a - 1 in {1, p_i} ] This implies ( a = 1 ) or ( b = 1 ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( k ) must be prime. Hence, ( p_i = 2^k - 1 ) is prime, divides ( N ), and ( k ) is prime, as desired. (blacksquare) 5. From now on, assume that ( p_i + 1 ) is not a power of 2 for all ( i ). From equation (1), we have: [ (p_1 + 1) mid 3 cdot 2^a p_1 ldots p_m ] Using the result from Claim 1, we obtain: [ (p_1 + 1) mid 3 cdot 2^a ] Hence, we may write ( p_1 + 1 = 3 cdot 2^{x_1} ) with ( x_1 in mathbb{N} ). 6. Therefore: [ (2^{a+1} - 1)(p_2 + 1) ldots (p_m + 1) = 2^{a - x_1} p_1 p_2 ldots p_m ] Similarly, we may write ( p_2 + 1 = p_2 cdot 2^{x_2} ). Continuing like this, we conclude that ( p_i + 1 = p_{i-1} cdot 2^{x_i} ) for all ( i geq 2 ). 7. Comparing the ( v_2 )'s, we obtain ( x_1 + ldots + x_m = a ). Substituting these in equation (1), we have: [ 2^{a+1} - 1 = p_m ] which is a contradiction to our assumption that ( p_i + 1 ) is not a power of 2 for all ( i ). In any case, we are done.

Factoring possesses a challenge here as the expression does not neatly decompose like a sum or difference of cubes or squares. Thus, we explore potential factorization: [ n^3 + n + 1 = n^3 + n + 1.] We cannot straightforwardly factorize (n^3 + n + 1), but we can analyze the expression for primality for small (n). Once the number becomes large or complex, it probably isn't easy to test using elementary methods alone, and unless a factor is clear for small (n), or criteria for non-primality (such as evident divisibility by a specific number) is identified, an assumption of potential primality might have to be accepted. We examine the first few values: - (n = 2): (n^3 + n + 1 = 8 + 2 + 1 = 11) (prime) - (n = 3): (n^3 + n + 1 = 27 + 3 + 1 = 31) (prime) - (For ngeq 4), the expression (n^3 + n + 1) grows rapidly, so computational checks suggest they are also not divisible by any of the numbers less than (n). Thus, (1011_n) for (n=2) and (n=3) are prime, and larger values of (n) need more sophisticated methods to check primality; thus, computational checking may suggest more primes, unless a simpler methodology or breaking points (i.e., values beyond which the expression can be conclusively determined not prime by elementary methods) can be found. Conclusion: For (n=2) and (n=3), (1011_n) is prime, and it remains computationally suggested for higher values of (n), assuming complex primality testing is executed.

Let's break down the solution step-by-step: 1. **Understand the Condition for a Multiple of 30**: A number is a multiple of 30 if it is also a multiple of both 3 and 10. 2. **Check for Multiplicity by 3**: Because the original string consists of fifteen 1's, any insertion of pluses will sum up individual groups of 1's. The total sum will always be 15, which is inherently a multiple of 3. Therefore, we don't need to worry about checking this condition further. 3. **Check for Multiplicity by 10**: For the sum to be a multiple of 10, the last digit of the resultant sum must be 0. For this to happen with our string of 1's, the sum must have exactly one group which sums to a number ending in 0. 4. **Number of Summands**: Since the digit must end in 0 and we want the sum to be a multiple of 10, we need exactly 10 summands. Since there are 15 ones, forming ten groups will sum to 10 if the groups look something like this: 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 (exactly 10 groups of 1). To make this configuration, we will need to choose 9 positions between the digits to place the plus signs \`+\`. 5. **Select Positions for the Pluses**: From the 14 possible positions (between the fifteen 1's), we need to choose 9 positions to place the pluses in, thereby creating 10 groups. 6. **Calculate the Combinations**: The number of ways to choose 9 positions from 14 possible positions is given by the combination formula: [ binom{14}{9} = binom{14}{5} ] Where: [ binom{14}{9} = frac{14!}{9!(14-9)!} = frac{14!}{9! cdot 5!} ] 7. **Compute the Value**: Perform the computation: [ binom{14}{9} = frac{14 times 13 times 12 times 11 times 10}{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = frac{240240}{120} = 2002 ] # Conclusion: The number of ways to insert pluses between the digits of \`111111111111111\` to obtain a result that is a multiple of 30 is: [ boxed{2002} ]"},{"prompt":"f tan x+tan y=15 and cot x + cot y=20, what is tan(x+y)?","completion":"The equation cot x + cot y = 20 can be translated to frac{1}{tan x} + frac{1}{tan y} = 20, which gives frac{tan x + tan y}{tan x tan y} = 20.

We will express these segments in terms of other known values: frac{a}{AH} + frac{b}{BH} + frac{c}{CH} 2. Use the fact that AH, BH, and CH can be expressed using the circumradius R and the angles of the triangle: frac{a}{AH} = frac{a}{2R cos A}, quad frac{b}{BH} = frac{b}{2R cos B}, quad frac{c}{CH} = frac{c}{2R cos C} where R is the circumradius. 3. Substitute these values into the expression: frac{a}{2R cos A} + frac{b}{2R cos B} + frac{c}{2R cos C} which simplifies to: frac{a}{A H}+ frac{b}{B H} + frac{c}{C H} 4.

Proof 2: 1. Start by expressing the area triangle ABC in terms of a, b, c, and R: abc = 4R cdot text{Area} (triangle ABC) where R is the circumradius. Realize that: text{Area} (triangle ABC) = text{Area} (triangle BHC) + text{Area} (triangle CHB) + text{Area} (triangle AHB) 2. Express each sub-area in terms of the respective sides and heights: 4R left( text{Area} (triangle BHC) + text{Area} (triangle BHC) + text{Area} (triangle AHB) right) 3. Using the sine area formula for triangle areas, we have: text{Area} (triangle BHC) = frac{1}{2} BH cdot CH sin (pi -A) Similarly for the other triangles: text{Area} (triangle CHB) = frac{1}{2} CH cdot AH sin (pi -B) And: text{Area} (triangle AHB) = frac{1}{2} AH cdot BH sin (pi -C) 4.

The number of factors of a number n can be determined by its prime factorization. If n has a prime factorization of: n = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak where p1, p2, ..., pk are distinct prime factors and a1, a2, ..., ak are their respective exponents, then the number of factors of n is given by: Number of factors = (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * ... * (ak + 1) This is because each exponent can be combined with the others in (ai + 1) ways (including the 0th power, which corresponds to not choosing that prime factor at all). Given that n has 211 factors, we can set up the equation: (a1 + 1) * (a2 + 1) * ... * (ak + 1) = 211 Since 211 is a prime number, it can only be factored as 211 * 1. This means that in the prime factorization of n, there can only be one prime factor raised to the 210th power (since 210 + 1 = 211), or there can be multiple prime factors whose exponents, when added 1 and multiplied together, equal 211. However, since 211 is prime and cannot be factored further, the only way to express it as a product of integers is as 211 * 1. This means that there is only one prime factor with an exponent of 210.

How many minutes more did it take Beth to complete the trip compared to Jerry?","completion":"First, let's find out how far Jerry drove. Since he drove at an average speed of 40 miles per hour and completed the trip in 30 minutes, we need to convert the time to hours to match the units of speed. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour). Now, we can calculate the distance Jerry traveled: Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 40 miles/hour × 0.5 hours Distance = 20 miles Since Beth's route was 5 miles longer, she drove 20 miles + 5 miles = 25 miles. Now, let's find out how long it took Beth to complete her trip.

According to the given equation, we have: [ sin^2(A) + sin^2(B) + sin^2(C) = 2 (cos^2(A) + cos^2(B) + cos^2(C)) ] 4.

Prove that the midpoint of the segment (M N) lies on the bisector of the right angle of the triangle.","completion":"1. Given a right-angled triangle ( triangle ABC ) with ( angle ACB = 90^circ ), two equal circles are constructed inside the triangle such that the first circle touches the leg ( AC ) and the hypotenuse ( AB ), and the second circle touches the leg ( BC ) and the hypotenuse ( AB ), and these circles are tangent to each other. 2. Let ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) be the centers of the circles. The radii of the circles are equal because the circles are of equal size. Let ( r ) be the radii of the circles. 3. Let ( M ) and ( N ) be the points of tangency of the circles with the hypotenuse ( AB ). 4. We need to prove that the midpoint ( K ) of the segment ( MN ) lies on the angle bisector of the right angle ( angle ACB ) of the triangle. # Using the first approach: 1. The common tangent to the two circles at point ( K ) intersects the legs ( AC ) and ( BC ) at the points ( P ) and ( Q ) respectively. 2. The right-angled triangles ( triangle AKP ) and ( triangle BQK ) are similar to each other because ( AK = BK ) (the distances from ( K ) to ( AC ) and ( BC )). 3. Since the inscribed circles are equal in size, these right triangles are congruent. 4. It follows that the distances from ( K ) to the legs ( AC ) and ( BC ) are equal. Therefore, the point ( K ) must lie on the angle bisector of the right angle formed by ( AC ) and ( BC ). This shows that the midpoint ( K ) of ( MN ) lies on the bisector of the right angle ( angle ACB ). # Using the second approach: 1. Consider the lines passing through the centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) of the circles parallel to the legs ( AC ) and ( BC ), respectively, until they intersect at the point ( L ). 2. The angles ( angle O_1LO_2 ) and ( angle O_1KO_2 ) are right angles because the lines ( O_1L ) and ( O_2L ) are parallel to the legs and perpendicular to ( AB ). Therefore, the quadrilateral ( O_1LO_2K ) is cyclic. 3. It follows that the angles ( angle O_1LK ) and ( angle O_2LK ) are equal as they subtend equal chords. 4. Thus, line ( LK ) is the angle bisector of ( angle O_1LO_2 ), meaning point ( K ) is equidistant from the lines ( O_1L ) and ( O_2L ), and hence also from the legs ( AC ) and ( BC ) of the triangle. This again confirms that the midpoint ( K ) of ( MN ) lies on the bisector of the right angle ( angle ACB ). # Using the third approach: 1. ( K ) is equidistant from the circles. Therefore, there is a rotation with center ( K ) that maps the first circle to the second circle. 2. This is a rotation by ( 90^circ ), which maps the leg ( AC ) to ( BC ), meaning the center of the rotation ( K ) must be equidistant from the legs ( AC ) and ( BC ). This further confirms that the midpoint ( K ) of ( MN ) lies on the bisector of the right angle ( angle ACB ). # Conclusion: Since we have verified through multiple methods that the midpoint ( K ) of the segment ( MN ) lies on the bisector of the right angle ( angle ACB ), we conclude: [ boxed{text{The midpoint of the segment } MN text{ lies on the angle bisector of the right angle of } triangle ABC.} ]"},{"prompt":"From the digits 0 to 9, two fivedigit numbers ( A ) and ( B ) can be formed.

We already have cos α and sin α, so we can find tan α using the quotient identity: tan α = frac{sin α}{cos α} = frac{-frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}}{frac{1}{3}} = -2sqrt{2} Now, using the identity tan (π-α) = -tan α: tan (π-α) = -tan α = -(-2sqrt{2}) = 2sqrt{2} Therefore, the answers are boxed{sin α = -frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}} and boxed{tan (π-α) = 2sqrt{2}}.

First, we ensure the coefficient {{n^2}-3n+3} is positive. This is equivalent to solving {{n}^{2}-3n+3}=1. Simplifying this equation gives us the possible values of n that make the coefficient positive. 3. Second, we need {{n^2}-2n} < 0 to ensure the function is decreasing. This inequality helps us determine the range of values for n that satisfy the condition for the function to be monotonically decreasing. Solving the system of equations and inequalities: [ left{begin{array}{l} {{n}^{2}-3n+3}=1 {{n}^{2}-2n}<0 end{array}right. ] For the first equation, {{n}^{2}-3n+3}=1, simplifying gives us the possible values of n that satisfy this condition. However, the solution provided directly jumps to the conclusion that n=1 or n=2 (with n=2 being discarded) without showing the simplification steps. This step implicitly involves solving the quadratic equation or recognizing that the equation simplifies to a condition that only certain values of n can satisfy. For the inequality {{n}^{2}-2n}<0, factoring gives n(n-2)<0, which implies that n must be between 0 and 2 (exclusive) for the inequality to hold. Combining these conditions, we find that n=1 is the only value that satisfies both the equation and the inequality, ensuring that the function is monotonically decreasing on left(0,+infty right). Therefore, the value of n for which the power function is monotonically decreasing on left(0,+infty right) is boxed{1}."},{"prompt":"Write down the coordinates of point N that is symmetric to point M(2,3) with respect to the xaxis ____.","completion":"To find the coordinates of point N that is symmetric to point M(2,3) with respect to the x-axis, we use the property of symmetry along the x-axis.

For a function to pass through the third quadrant, it must have negative values for certain x values, which implies certain conditions on alpha. **Step 1: Solve the equation for the coefficient of x^{alpha}.** Given that the coefficient of {x}^{alpha} is equal to 1, we set up the equation: [{alpha}^{2}-frac{7}{2}alpha+frac{5}{2} = 1] Solving this equation involves simplifying and finding the roots of the quadratic equation: begin{align*} {alpha}^{2}-frac{7}{2}alpha+frac{5}{2} &= 1 {alpha}^{2}-frac{7}{2}alpha+frac{3}{2} &= 0 end{align*} Using the quadratic formula, where a=1, b=-frac{7}{2}, and c=frac{3}{2}, we find the values of alpha: [alpha = frac{1}{2} quad text{or} quad alpha = 3] **Step 2: Determine which value of alpha satisfies the condition of passing through the third quadrant.** - For alpha=frac{1}{2}, the function becomes f(x)=sqrt{x}, which only produces positive values for x>0 and is undefined for x<0.

Find the volume of each part if the volume of the tetrahedron is 1.","completion":"1. Let's start by understanding the geometry of the problem. We are given a regular tetrahedron, and we need to determine how many parts it is divided into by six planes. Each plane passes through one edge and the midpoint of the opposite edge of the tetrahedron. 2. Note that any plane passing through one edge and the midpoint of the opposite edge will also intersect the other two edges at their midpoints. This means each plane goes through a line that connects the midpoints of two opposite edges within the tetrahedron. 3. The intersection of these six planes will always occur at the centroid (center of mass) of the tetrahedron. This is a known result from geometry which states that the medians of a tetrahedron (lines joining vertices to the centroids of their opposite faces) intersect at a single point, the centroid (textit{Theorem 92}). 4. Each of these planes divides the tetrahedron into two equal parts along the intersection line. Because of the symmetry, these planes will divide the tetrahedron into smaller tetrahedral sections. 5. Given that each plane divides the tetrahedron's space into multiple polyhedral regions, let's count the divisions. Each additional plane increases the number of regions exponentially. 6. The problem's complexity increases with every additional plane, resulting in an increasing number of small tetrahedrons inside the original tetrahedron. By careful analysis or mathematical induction, it can be shown that the total number of these smaller regions created by six planes in this manner is 24. 7. Let's validate this with symmetry considerations. Each face of the original tetrahedron is split into six smaller triangular sections by the planes (considering the plane segments crossing a face). Given there are four faces, the total number of smaller triangles is: [ 6 times 4 = 24 ] 8. Using symmetry, we understand each smaller tetrahedral section formed is of equal volume because each plane divided the structure in the exact same regular pattern. 9. Since the volume of the entire tetrahedron is ( 1 ), dividing this volume evenly among the 24 smaller tetrahedral sections gives: [ text{Volume of each smaller tetrahedral section} = frac{1}{24} ] # Conclusion: The volume of each of the parts into which the tetrahedron is divided is: [ boxed{frac{1}{24}} ]"},{"prompt":"Distribute 5 tickets, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, among 4 people, with each person receiving at least 1 ticket.

Since the tickets must be consecutive, there are 4 sets of consecutive tickets (1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5), so there are 4 times 4 = 16 ways in this case. 2. **Case 2**: Two people get one ticket each, and one person gets two consecutive tickets, while another person gets the remaining two consecutive tickets. There are binom{4}{2} = 6 ways to choose which two people get two tickets each.

Therefore, the selling price per unit of type A bicycles last year was boxed{2000 text{ yuan}}. Part 2: Maximizing Profit from Sales of New Batch of Bicycles Let the shop purchase a units of new type A bicycles this year, meaning it purchases (60-a) units of type B bicycles. The profit y yuan is calculated as: [ y = (2000 - 200 - 1500)a + (2400 - 1800)(60 - a) ] Simplifying: [ y = -300a + 36000 ] Given the constraint that the quantity of type B bicycles does not exceed twice the quantity of type A bicycles, we have: [ 60 - a leqslant 2a ] Solving for a: [ 60 leqslant 3a ] [ a geqslant 20 ] Since y = -300a + 36000, and the coefficient of a is negative (k = -300 < 0), the profit y decreases as a increases. Thus, to maximize profit, we choose the smallest possible value for a, which is a = 20. This results in the maximum profit. Therefore, the shop should purchase 20 units of new type A bicycles and 60 - 20 = 40 units of type B bicycles to maximize the profit from the sales of this batch of bicycles. The final answer is boxed{20 text{ units of type } A text{ and } 40 text{ units of type } B}}."},{"prompt":"The milk level in a rectangular box measuring 62 feet by some feet is to be lowered by 6 inches. To do this, 5812.5 gallons of milk must be removed. What is the width of the rectangular box?","completion":"First, we need to convert the volume of milk to be removed into cubic feet because the dimensions of the box are given in feet. There are 7.48052 gallons in a cubic foot. So, we convert 5812.5 gallons to cubic feet: 5812.5 gallons * (1 cubic foot / 7.48052 gallons) = 776.793 cubic feet (approximately) Now, we know that the milk level is to be lowered by 6 inches, which is 0.5 feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot). The volume of milk to be removed is the product of the area of the base of the box and the height by which the milk level is to be lowered. Let's denote the unknown width of the box as W feet. The length of the box is given as 62 feet. So, the area of the base of the box is 62 * W square feet. The volume of milk to be removed is the area of the base multiplied by the height (0.5 feet): Volume = Area of base * Height 776.793 cubic feet = (62 * W) * 0.5 Now, we solve for W: 776.793 = 31 * W W = 776.793 / 31 W = 25.057 feet So, the width of the rectangular box is approximately boxed{25.057} feet."},{"prompt":"Mimi has decided to start going to the gym again.

Since A(0,1) lies on the ellipse, b=1 because y^2 = b^2 at this point. 2. The eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3}, where c is the distance from the center to a focus and a is the semi-major axis. 3. The relationship between a, b, and c for an ellipse is given by a^2 = b^2 + c^2. Solving these equations, we find: - From e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3} and a^2 = b^2 + c^2, substituting b=1, we get a^2 = 1 + c^2. - Since e = frac{sqrt{6}}{3}, we have c = frac{sqrt{6}}{3}a. Substituting c into the equation a^2 = 1 + c^2 gives a^2 = 1 + left(frac{sqrt{6}}{3}aright)^2. - Solving for a, we find a = sqrt{3} and consequently b = 1.

Intersecting this with the ellipse C: x^2 + 3y^2 - 3 = 0 gives a quadratic equation in x: (3k^2 + 1)x^2 + 6kmx + 3(m^2 - 1) = 0. For points M(x_1, y_1) and N(x_2, y_2) on this line, we have: - The sum of the roots x_1 + x_2 = -frac{6km}{3k^2 + 1}. - The product of the roots x_1x_2 = frac{3(m^2 - 1)}{3k^2 + 1}. Given that the sum of slopes of lines AM and AN is 4, we can express this as: k_{AM} + k_{AN} = 4 = 2k + frac{(m-1)(x_1 + x_2)}{x_1x_2} = 2k - frac{2km}{m+1}. Solving for m in terms of k, we find m = frac{k}{2} - 1.

The angle that satisfies these conditions is alpha = frac{5pi}{3} or -frac{pi}{3} (in the fourth quadrant, where cosine is positive and sine is negative).

Similarly, overrightarrow{FB} = (4-1, 4-0) = (3,4). 4. **Calculate cos angle AFB:** The cosine of the angle angle AFB can be found using the dot product formula for vectors: [ cos angle AFB = dfrac{overrightarrow{FA} cdot overrightarrow{FB}}{|overrightarrow{FA}| cdot |overrightarrow{FB}|} ] Substituting the vectors overrightarrow{FA} = (0,-2) and overrightarrow{FB} = (3,4), we get: [ cos angle AFB = dfrac{0cdot3 + (-2)cdot4}{sqrt{0^2+(-2)^2} cdot sqrt{3^2+4^2}} = dfrac{-8}{sqrt{4} cdot sqrt{25}} = dfrac{-8}{2 cdot 5} = -dfrac{4}{5} ] Therefore, the correct answer is option D: boxed{-dfrac{4}{5}}."},{"prompt":"Given the function fleft(xright)=x^{2}ln x, the interval where the function fleft(xright) is monotonically decreasing is ( ).

This is because if both ( a ) and ( b ) are odd, then their sum ( a+b ) will be even. - If ( ab(a+b) ) and ( n ) are coprime, i.e., (gcd(ab(a+b), n) = 1), it must imply that ( n ) is odd. - Therefore, for even ( n ), there are no suitable ( a ) and ( b ) that satisfy (gcd(ab(a+b), n) = 1). 2. **Find appropriate ( a ) and ( b ) for odd ( n ):** - If ( n ) is odd (for example, let ( n = 3 )), we can take ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 1 ). - Then, ( ab(a+b) = 1 cdot 1 cdot (1+1) = 2 ), and (gcd(2, n) = gcd(2, 3) = 1), which shows ( n ) and ( ab(a+b) ) are coprime. - Therefore, ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 1 ) work for any odd ( n ). 3. **Additional condition that ( a - b ) is not divisible by ( n ):** - If we add the condition that ( a - b ) should not be divisible by ( n ), the calculation needs to check for more constraints. - If ( n = 1 ), then ( gcd(ab(a+b), n)) is trivially 1 because ( gcd) of any number with 1 is 1. However, (1 | (a - b)), so this case does not work as (a - b) should not be divisible by (n). 4. **For ( n geq 3 ):** - If ( n ) is a larger odd number, say ( n > 3 ), let’s choose ( a = 2 ) and ( b = n-1 ). - Then, [ ab(a+b) = 2(n-1)(2 + (n-1)) = 2(n-1)(n+1). ] - Since ( n ) is odd, ( n-1 ) and ( n+1 ) are consecutive even and odd numbers respectively, and thus coprime with any ( n ). Hence, [ gcd(2(n-1)(n+1), n) = 1. ] - Moreover, [ a - b = 2 - (n - 1) = 3 - n. ] - Given ( n ) is odd and greater than 3, ( 3 - n ) is not divisible by ( n ). 5. **Special case when ( n = 3 ):** - If ( n = 3 ), both ( a ) and ( b ) cannot give the same remainder modulo 3 due to the condition ( 3 nmid (a - b) ). - If we select ( a ) and ( b ) such that they leave different remainders when divided by 3, one of them will inherently make ( a + b ) divisible by 3. - Consequently, for ( n = 3 ), there are no suitable candidates ( a ) and ( b ). # Conclusion: 1.

We are given that the ratio of the amounts of solution Y to solution Z is 3:2, so we can write y = 3k and z = 2k for some constant k. The total amount of material A in the final mixture is 25%. This means that the amount of material A from each solution, when combined, should make up 25% of the total mixture. We can write this as an equation: 0.20x + 0.30y + 0.40z = 0.25(x + y + z) We also know that y = 3k and z = 2k, so we can substitute these into the equation: 0.20x + 0.30(3k) + 0.40(2k) = 0.25(x + 3k + 2k) Now, let's simplify and solve for x: 0.20x + 0.90k + 0.80k = 0.25x + 0.25(5k) 0.20x + 1.70k = 0.25x + 1.25k Now, let's move the terms involving x to one side and the terms involving k to the other side: 0.20x - 0.25x = 1.25k - 1.70k -0.05x = -0.45k Now, divide both sides by -0.05 to solve for x: x = (-0.45k) / (-0.05) x = 9k Now we have the amount of solution X in terms of k.

Assume that point K does not lie on the line s. 3. Because MK is perpendicular to the plane beta, the line MK is perpendicular to the intersection line s. This means MK perp s. 4. Now, let's consider a plane gamma which contains the line MK and is perpendicular to the line s. Let P be the point of intersection of the plane gamma with the line s. 5. In this configuration, the triangle MRK is the linear angle of the dihedral angle formed by the planes alpha and beta. Given angle MPK = 90^circ, and since MK perp beta, we have angle MKP = 90^circ. 6. This setup implies that there are two distinct lines through point M in plane gamma that are perpendicular to the line PK, which is impossible because in Euclidean geometry, through a given point, there can be only one perpendicular to a given line. 7.

To find the fraction of employees who had neither cell phones nor pagers, we need to subtract the number of employees with cell phones, pagers, and both from the total number of employees.

The employees who have both are included in the count of those who have cell phones and also in the count of those who have pagers.

This is because tau(n) is always at least 2 for any n > 1 and tau(2) = 2. - Therefore, it suffices to show that from 2, Brandon can reach any positive integer b > 1. 3. **Reaching Powers of 2:** - We need to show that Brandon can reach every power of 2. - Observe that tau(2^k) = k + 1. Hence, by applying tau to 2^k, we can reach k + 1. - Conversely, varphi(2^k) = 2^{k-1}. Thus, by applying varphi to 2^k, we can reach 2^{k-1}. - By iterating this process, we can reach arbitrarily large powers of 2. 4. **Reaching Arbitrarily Large Numbers:** - To show that we can reach numbers with arbitrarily large nu_2 (the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization), consider the effect of varphi on a number n. - Applying varphi to a number n decreases its nu_p (exponent of any prime p) by at most 1. - Repeatedly applying varphi will eventually reduce nu_p to 0 for any prime p. 5. **Contradiction Argument:** - Suppose for contradiction that the nu_p of any reachable number is bounded for any prime p. - Consider the number m after repeatedly applying varphi until it is of the form 2^i3^j, 2^ip where p neq 3 is an odd prime, or 2^i. - The nu_2 of m decreases by at most 1 each time varphi is applied, and increases by some number l. - If l = 1 for two consecutive applications of varphi, then m must have exactly one odd prime divisor p without multiplicity, which is 3 pmod{4} and not equal to 3. - However, varphi(m) would then be divisible by at least two distinct odd primes, contradicting the assumption that l = 1 for two consecutive applications. 6. **Reaching Arbitrarily Large Numbers:** - Since sigma(n) generates arbitrarily large numbers, we can reach arbitrarily large numbers. - For large enough reachable n, repeated applications of varphi starting from n must result in a number of the form 2^ip_n for some prime p_n > 3. - This implies that frac{n}{f(n)} (where f(n) is the largest prime divisor of n) is bounded above, leading to a contradiction. 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, Brandon can reach any positive integer b > 1 from any starting integer a > 1 using a finite sequence of button presses. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that function f(x) is an even function defined on [5,5], and is a decreasing function on [0,5].

Consider the irrational number alpha, assumed to be positive. 2. We need to show that there exists an integer multiple of alpha with an infinite number of 0s or 9s in its decimal expansion. 3.

Specifically, we aim to show that: left[10^{n}kalpharight] equiv left[10^{n}lalpharight] pmod{10}. 4. Therefore, it must be that: [10^n(kalpha)] - [10^n(lalpha)] - 1 < [10^n(kalpha) - 10^n(lalpha)] leq [10^n(kalpha)] - [10^n(lalpha)].

From the previous step, it follows that: [10^n(k-l)alpha] equiv 0 text{ or } 9 pmod{10}. Since the left side is non-negative, we deduce that (k-l)alpha has 0 or 9 at its n-th decimal place when considering the non-negative difference. 6. To establish the infinite occurrence of 0s or 9s using the pigeonhole principle (Dirichlet's principle): - Consider that there are only 10 possible digit values for the n-th decimal place ( (0-9) ). - Therefore, for each n, there exist integers 1 leq k_n < l_n leq 11 such that k_n alpha and l_n alpha share the same n-th decimal digit. 7. Additionally, since pairs (k_n, l_n) are chosen from a finite set of binom{11}{2} elements, one pair (k, l) must repeat infinitely often. 8. Consequently, k alpha and l alpha have identical decimal representation for an infinite number of places, implying: (k-l)alpha which contains 0 or 9 infinitely in its decimal digits.

Each jury member must solve ( 26 - n ) problems from these remaining problems. 3. **Counting total solves**: The total number of solves by the jury members is ( 40(26 - n) ). The maximum number of solves for the ( 30 - n ) problems is ( 19(30 - n) ).

This means there can be no problems that were solved by all 40 members of the jury. 6. **Maximum number of solves**: If our initial assumption is true, each of the 30 problems were solved at most 19 times.

Single burgers cost 1.00 each and double burgers cost 1.50 each. How many double burgers did he buy?","completion":"Let's denote the number of single burgers as S and the number of double burgers as D. We have two pieces of information: 1. The total number of burgers is 50, so S + D = 50. 2. The total cost of the burgers is 66.50, and since single burgers cost 1.00 each and double burgers cost 1.50 each, the cost equation is 1.00S + 1.50D = 66.50. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of S and D. From the first equation, we can express S in terms of D: S = 50 - D. Now we can substitute this expression for S into the second equation: 1.00(50 - D) + 1.50D = 66.50. Expanding this, we get: 50 - D + 1.50D = 66.50. Combining like terms, we get: 50 + 0.50D = 66.50. Now, let's solve for D: 0.50D = 66.50 - 50, 0.50D = 16.50. Dividing both sides by 0.50 to solve for D, we get: D = 16.50 / 0.50, D = 33.

Since ( A_n equiv A_{N-1} pmod{p^N} ) for all ( n geq N-1 ), we have ( nu_p((A_n)^2 + 999) < N ). - Consider ( d_n = gcd(10^n, (A_{n-1})^2 + 999) ). We have ( d_n mid frac{10^n}{p^n} cdot p^N ), so: [ K_n equiv K_{n-1} pmod{frac{10^n}{d_n}} implies K_n equiv K_{n-1} pmod{p^{n-N}} ] - Since ( K_n = frac{(B_n)^2 + 999}{(A_n)^2 + 999} < frac{10^{2n+2} + 999}{10^{2n} + 999} < 100 ), take ( p^{n-N} > 100 ) and the claim is proven. (blacksquare) 6. **Case 1:** Assume ( 10^{n+1} mid (A_n)^2 + 999 mid (B_n)^2 + 999 ) for all ( n geq 0 ). - We claim ( 2 cdot 10^n mid (A_{n-1})^2 + 999 ) for all ( n geq 1 ). - We have: [ (A_n)^2 + 999 = (10^n a_n + A_{n-1})^2 + 999 equiv 2 cdot 10^n a_n + (A_{n-1})^2 + 999 pmod{2 cdot 10^n} ] So, ( 2 cdot 10^n mid (A_{n-1})^2 + 999 ). 7. We prove ( a_n = b_n ) for all ( n geq 0 ) by induction on ( n ). - Check ( n = 0, 1 ) by direct calculation. - Assume ( a_k = b_k ) for all ( k < n ). We only care about ( A_{n-1} = B_{n-1} ). - We have: [ (A_n)^2 + 999 = 2 cdot 10^n a_n A_{n-1} + (A_{n-1})^2 + 999 equiv 0 pmod{2 cdot 10^{n+1}} ] which implies: [ a_n A_{n-1} + frac{(A_{n-1})^2 + 999}{2 cdot 10^n} equiv 0 pmod{10} ] - Similarly: [ b_n B_{n-1} + frac{(B_{n-1})^2 + 999}{2 cdot 10^n} equiv 0 pmod{10} ] - This gives ( a_n equiv b_n pmod{10} ). Since ( a_n, b_n < 10 ), we get ( a_n = b_n ) and we are done by induction. (blacksquare) 8. **Case 2:** ( K_n ) is eventually constant. - For all ( n > N ), ( (B_n)^2 + 999 = K left( (A_n)^2 + 999 right) ). - For large ( n ), ( frac{(B_n)^2}{(A_n)^2} approx frac{(B_n)^2 + 999}{(A_n)^2 + 999} = K ). Thus, ( lim_{n to infty} frac{B_n}{A_n} = sqrt{K} ). - Define ( C_n = frac{B_n}{A_n} - sqrt{K} ), so ( lim_{n to infty} C_n = 0 ). - Using the equalities: [ B_n = 10^n b_n + B_{n-1} quad text{and} quad A_n = 10^n a_n + A_{n-1} ] we get: [ frac{10^n}{A_{n-1}} (b_n^2 - K a_n^2) = 2 (K a_n - b_n frac{B_{n-1}}{A_{n-1}}) ] which simplifies to: [ frac{10^n}{A_{n-1}} (b_n^2 - K a_n^2) = -2 sqrt{K} (b_n - sqrt{K} a_n) - 2 b_n C_{n-1} ] and further to: [ (b_n - sqrt{K} a_n) left( frac{10^n}{A_{n-1}} (b_n + sqrt{K} a_n) + 2 sqrt{K} right) = -2 b_n C_{n-1} ] - Taking ( n to infty ) in the above equation, since ( b_n ) takes finitely many values, the RHS goes to 0. The second factor of the LHS is always positive, so ( lim_{n to infty} b_n - sqrt{K} a_n = 0 ). - Since ( b_n - sqrt{K} a_n ) takes only finitely many values, there exists ( L ) such that for all ( n > L ), ( b_n = sqrt{K} a_n ). Plugging in ( n > L ) in the equation, we get ( C_{n-1} = 0 ), so ( frac{B_n}{A_n} = sqrt{K} ) for all large ( n ). Plugging into the equation ( (B_n)^2 + 999 = K left( (A_n)^2 + 999 right) ), we get ( K = 1 ). Thus, ( A_n = B_n ) holds for all large ( n ). By definition of ( A_n ) and ( B_n ), we conclude that ( a_n = b_n ) for all ( n geq 0 ). (blacksquare) The final answer is ( boxed{ a_n = b_n } ) for all ( n geq 0 )."},{"prompt":"The equation of the tangent line to the curve y=frac{2x1}{x+2} at the point left(1,3right) is ______.","completion":"To find the equation of the tangent line to the curve y=frac{2x-1}{x+2} at the point left(-1,-3right), we follow these steps: 1. **Differentiate the given function** to find the slope of the tangent line.

Such a plane will be defined uniquely by these three points unless the points are collinear. 3. **Calculating Projections Using Pythagorean Theorem**: - For each segment ( OA, OB, ) and ( OC ), we calculate the projection onto the plane ( Pi ). - Let the perpendicular distance from point ( O ) to the plane ( Pi ) be ( h ). - Because the segments ( OA, OB, ) and ( OC ) are equal and they all form the same angle to the plane ( Pi ), their projections onto ( Pi ) can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem as follows: [ text{Length of the projection} = sqrt{x^2 - h^2} ] 4. **Conclusion**: - Since all three segments ( OA, OB, ) and ( OC ) initially have the same length ( x ) and the distance from point ( O ) to the plane ( Pi ) is the same ( h ), the projections of all three segments onto the plane ( Pi ) will indeed be equal: [ sqrt{x^2 - h^2} ] - Thus, projected segments will be equal irrespective of their orientation in space because of the constant distance ( h ).

Let's denote the common ratio of the geometric sequence {a_{n}} by q, where qneq 0 and qneq 1, to ensure the sequence is indeed geometric and infinite. 1. **Sum of the First 3 Terms**: The sum of the first 3 terms is given by the formula S_{3} = a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} = frac{a_{1}(1-q^{3})}{1-q}. We are told this sum equals 168, so we have: [ frac{a_{1}(1-q^{3})}{1-q} = 168 ] 2. **Difference Between a_{2} and a_{5}**: The difference a_{2} - a_{5} is given as 42. Using the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence, a_{n} = a_{1}q^{n-1}, we can express a_{2} as a_{1}q and a_{5} as a_{1}q^{4}. Thus, the difference can be written as: [ a_{1}q - a_{1}q^{4} = a_{1}q(1-q^{3}) = 42 ] 3. **Finding the Common Ratio q**: From the above equations, we can see that both expressions involve a_{1}q(1-q^{3}). By comparing the two, we can deduce that: [ frac{168}{42} = frac{a_{1}(1-q^{3})}{1-q} cdot frac{1}{a_{1}q(1-q^{3})} = frac{1}{q} ] Simplifying this gives us q = frac{1}{2}. 4. **Finding the First Term a_{1}**: With q found, we can substitute q = frac{1}{2} back into either of the original equations to find a_{1}.

Now for the induction case, suppose the theorem holds for any n vertices inside m-sided polygonal T. So to show the sum of the angles of a polygon which contains (n+1) vertices inside it, we go as follows: - Consider a vertex S_{n+1}. - Suppose the polyhedral angle at S_{n+1} has p faces. - We select points on each edge of this angle and connect them sequentially to form a smaller polygon around S_{n+1}. - By duplicating these steps following the induction hypothesis and splitting angles as mentioned, we prove the statement for n+1 vertices.

Additionally, if points A and Y lie on different sides of the line XT and angle XAT = 3alpha, then point A also lies on this circle. **Proof of the Lemma:** 1. Let O be the intersection of the angle bisectors of angle XYZ and angle YZT. Consider triangles OXY and OZY. Because angle XYZ = angle YZT and XY = YZ = ZT, the triangles OXY and OZY are isosceles with the same sides. Hence, OX = OY = OZ. Similarly, the triangle OZT is congruent to OXY, thus OT = OZ. Therefore, points X, Y, Z, T are equidistant from O and lie on the circle centered at O. 2. The angle at each vertex of the isosceles triangles is 2alpha, therefore the arc XYZT of the circle is 6alpha. 3. Given angle XAT = 3alpha, point A also lies on this circle since it subtends the same chord as all the other points. The lemma is hence proved. Now consider an arbitrary triangle ABC with angles 3alpha, 3beta, and 3gamma respectively. Let the adjacent trisectors of angles at vertices B and C intersect at point P. Similarly, let another pair of adjacent trisectors of these angles intersect at Q. 1. Point P is the intersection of the angle bisectors of triangle BQC, thus QP is an angle bisector of angle BQC. angle BPQ = 90^circ + frac{1}{2} angle BCQ = 90^circ + frac{1}{2} cdot 2gamma = 90^circ + gamma 2. Mark points Y and Z on sides QB and QC respectively such that angle QPY = angle QPZ = 30^circ. Then, angle BPY = angle BPQ - angle YPQ = (90^circ + gamma) - 30^circ = 60^circ + gamma 3. Triangles QPY and QPZ are congruent because they share a side QP and have equal angles. Hence, PY = PZ text{ and }angle YPZ = 60^circ implies triangle PYZ text{ is equilateral.} By symmetry, let X be symmetric to P with respect to the angle bisector at vertex A, and T be symmetric to P with respect to the angle bisector at vertex C. Thus, XY = YZ = ZT angle BXY = angle BPY = 60^circ + gamma angle XYZ = 360^circ - angle PBX - 2angle BPY = 360^circ - 2beta - 120^circ - 2gamma = 180^circ - 2alpha angle YZT = 180^circ - 2alpha Since 180^circ - 2alpha > 60^circ as alpha < 60^circ, it follows from the lemma that points X, Y, Z, T, and A must lie on a circle. Finally, consider any three intersection points of trisectors, X, Y, and Z. As these points form a cyclic quadrilateral and trisected angles of the original triangle, the internal angles sum to 120^circ. As all the chords XY, YZ, ZT are equal and subtend equal angles, the intersections form equilateral triangles by symmetry.

To determine the sign of y', we examine the intervals divided by the critical points: (-infty, -2), (-2, 0), and (0, +infty). - For x in (-infty, -2), x^2 + 2x > 0, so y' > 0, indicating that y is increasing in this interval. - For x in (-2, 0), x^2 + 2x < 0, so y' < 0, indicating that y is decreasing in this interval. - For x in (0, +infty), x^2 + 2x > 0, so y' > 0, indicating that y is increasing in this interval.

First, we have a number divided by ((8 ^ (2/3)) / 5). To simplify this, we need to calculate 8^(2/3). The exponent 2/3 means we take the cube root of 8 and then square it. The cube root of 8 is 2, and squaring 2 gives us 4. So, 8^(2/3) is 4. Now we have the number divided by (4 / 5), which is the same as multiplying the number by the reciprocal of (4 / 5), which is 5/4. Next, we multiply by the cube root of (12 ⁄ 19). The cube root of a number is the same as raising that number to the power of 1/3. So, we are multiplying by (12 ⁄ 19)^(1/3). Now, we have the expression (number * 5/4 * (12 ⁄ 19)^(1/3)). Finally, we take this whole expression to the power of (3/5). This means we raise each part of the expression to the power of (3/5). So, the equivalent single number we are multiplying by is: (5/4)^(3/5) * ((12 ⁄ 19)^(1/3))^(3/5) Now, let's simplify this further: (5/4)^(3/5) is the same as the fifth root of (5/4)^3. The fifth root of a number is the same as raising that number to the power of 1/5. So, we have: ((5^3) / (4^3))^(1/5) And for the second part: ((12 ⁄ 19)^(1/3))^(3/5) simplifies to (12 ⁄ 19)^(1/5) because (1/3) * (3/5) = 1/5. Now we multiply these two parts together: ((5^3) / (4^3))^(1/5) * (12 ⁄ 19)^(1/5) Since both parts are raised to the power of 1/5, we can combine them under the same exponent: ((5^3 * 12) / (4^3 * 19))^(1/5) Now we calculate 5^3 and 4^3: 5^3 = 125 4^3 = 64 So we have: ((125 * 12) / (64 * 19))^(1/5) Now we multiply 125 by 12 and 64 by 19: 125 * 12 = 1500 64 * 19 = 1216 So we have: (1500 / 1216)^(1/5) Now we can simplify the fraction 1500/1216: 1500 / 1216 = 1.234375 So the equivalent single number we are multiplying by is: (1.234375)^(1/5) To find the fifth root of 1.234375, we can use a calculator: (1.234375)^(1/5) ≈ 1.0412 Therefore, the equivalent single number you are multiplying by is approximately boxed{1.0412} ."},{"prompt":"town P, 60 percent of the population are employed, and some percent of the population are employed males. 25 percent of the employed people in town P are females.

Since the rest of the employed people are males, we subtract the number of employed females from the total number of employed people to find the number of employed males: 60 (employed people) - 15 (employed females) = 45 (employed males) Now, to find out what percent of the total population are employed males, we take the number of employed males (45) and divide it by the total population (100), then multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (45 / 100) * 100 = 45% Therefore, boxed{45} percent of the population in town P are employed males."},{"prompt":"Ancient Greek mathematicians called the numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, ... triangular numbers, which have a certain regularity.

After spending at the toy store, John had the following amount left: (1 - F) * A - (1/3) * (1 - F) * A = (2/3) * (1 - F) * A Finally, John spent his last 0.75 at the candy store. This means that: (2/3) * (1 - F) * A = 0.75 We know that A is approximately 2.81, so we can substitute A with 2.81 in the equation: (2/3) * (1 - F) * 2.81 = 0.75 Now, let's solve for F: (2/3) * (1 - F) * 2.81 = 0.75 (1 - F) * 2.81 = 0.75 * (3/2) (1 - F) * 2.81 = 1.125 1 - F = 1.125 / 2.81 1 - F = 0.400356 F = 1 - 0.400356 F = 0.599644 Since we are looking for the fraction of the allowance that John spent at the arcade, we can approximate F to a reasonable fraction.

Within this city model, there are 15 distinct intersections (places or vertices), and a tourist begins a tour from one intersection and ends at another, visiting each one exactly once. 2. Since the tourist starts and ends at different places, they traverse 14 edges (because starting and ending at different vertices in a connected graph with 15 vertices implies traveling along 14 edges to create a Hamiltonian path). 3. We will color the blocks in a chessboard pattern, where each block is either black or white, ensuring that no two adjacent blocks share the same color. Given the triangular nature of the blocks, this setup will lead to 10 black blocks and 6 white blocks. 4. Each triangular block has three edges. If a tourist travels along the edges of a single black block, they will make a 120^{circ} turn. However, if they only travel along one or two edges of a block, no such specific turn might happen unless they turn at an intersection related to two edges of a block. 5. Since the tourist cannot visit a block more than once, the route through the city will necessarily go along only two of the streets that bound any single black block. This means that the tourist will make a 120^{circ} turn at some intersections of those black blocks. 6. Since there are 10 black blocks, and the tourist misses one edge per block, we can assert that out of the 14 streets the tourist covers, 10 will definitely run along the boundaries of these black blocks.

This can only happen in one way: [ L - C = xC ] Step 2: Solve the equation Solving for (C) gives: [ L - C = xC implies L = (x + 1)C implies C = frac{L}{x + 1} ] Step 3: Determine if (C) is valid For (C) to be valid as the shorter piece, it must be less than or equal to half the rope's length: [ C leq frac{L}{2} ] Given (C = frac{L}{x + 1}), this is always true for (x > 1). Step 4: Calculate the probability The probability of cutting at exactly (C = frac{L}{x + 1}) in a continuous uniform distribution over a length (L) is (0) for any specific point. However, for practical purposes like this scenario, we consider the infinitesimal interval around (C), which still leads to a probability of nearly (0) as a single point does not affect the probability measure in a continuous distribution. Thus, the probability that the longer piece is exactly (x) times as large as the shorter piece is 0. Conclusion: Since a specific point on a continuous interval has a probability measure of zero, the probability of the longer piece being exactly (x) times the length of the shorter piece in a randomly cut rope of length (L) is essentially 0.

D: There are 20 ways to distribute the balls such that box 2 contains at least 2 balls, and the other 3 boxes each contain at least 1 ball.","completion":"To solve this problem, we will examine each option step by step, following the rules and guidelines provided. **Option A:** We want to distribute 8 identical balls into 4 boxes such that each box contains at least 1 ball. This is a problem of partitioning 8 items into 4 groups, each with at least one item. We can use the stars and bars method, where we consider the balls as stars and the partitions as bars. Since each box must contain at least one ball, we first place one ball in each box. This leaves us with 8 - 4 = 4 balls to freely distribute. The number of ways to do this is equivalent to placing 3 bars in the 4 - 1 = 3 spaces between the balls to create 4 non-empty groups. The formula for this is {C}_{n+k-1}^{k-1}, where n is the number of items to distribute, and k is the number of boxes. Thus, we have {C}_{7}^{3} = frac{7!}{3!4!} = 35 ways. **Option B:** For distributing the balls with at least one empty box, the calculation provided in the standard answer is incorrect. The correct approach involves subtracting the number of ways to distribute the balls with no restrictions from the number of ways to distribute them such that each box gets at least one ball. The total number of ways to distribute 8 balls into 4 boxes with no restrictions is given by the stars and bars method as {C}_{8+4-1}^{4-1} = {C}_{11}^{3} = 165. Subtracting the ways where each box gets at least one ball ({C}_{7}^{3} = 35), we get 165 - 35 = 130 ways. **Option C:** For exactly one box to be empty, we choose 1 out of the 4 boxes to be empty in {C}_{4}^{1} = 4 ways. Then, we distribute 8 balls into the remaining 3 boxes, each getting at least one ball. This is similar to the calculation in option A but for 3 boxes, which is {C}_{7}^{2} = 21 ways. However, the standard solution's calculation for this option is incorrect as it mistakenly uses a different approach. **Option D:** For box 2 to contain at least 2 balls, and the other 3 boxes each to contain at least 1 ball, we consider cases based on the number of balls in box 2: - If box 2 contains 2 balls, we distribute the remaining 6 balls into 3 boxes, which is {C}_{5}^{2} = 10 ways. - If box 2 contains 3 balls, we distribute the remaining 5 balls into 3 boxes, which is {C}_{4}^{2} = 6 ways. - If box 2 contains 4 balls, we distribute the remaining 4 balls into 3 boxes, which is {C}_{3}^{1} = 3 ways. - If box 2 contains 5 balls, we distribute the remaining 3 balls into 3 boxes, which is 1 way. Adding these up, we get 10 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 20 ways. Therefore, the correct options, following the step-by-step analysis and correcting the mistakes in the standard solution, are: - Option A: boxed{35} ways to distribute the balls such that each box contains at least 1 ball. - Option B: boxed{130} ways to distribute the balls with at least one empty box. - Option C: boxed{21} ways to distribute the balls such that exactly one box is empty. - Option D: boxed{20} ways to distribute the balls such that box 2 contains at least 2 balls, and the other 3 boxes each contain at least 1 ball.

Setting h'(x) > 0 gives us 0 < x < e. Hence, h(x) is decreasing on the interval [e,e^{2}]. Therefore, at x=e, we have the maximum value of h(x) given by h(x)_{text{max}} = frac{2}{e}.

Find the constant term of the expansion.","completion":"First, we determine the value of a by utilizing the information that the sum of the coefficients in the expansion is 2. Setting x=1, we have (1+ a)(2cdot 1 - frac{1}{1})^{5} = 1 + a. Since we are looking for the sum of the coefficients, we can ignore the variable x and its powers in the expansion. The sum of the coefficients equals to the expression evaluated at x=1. Therefore, 1 + a = 2. Solving this equation, we find that a = 2 - 1 = 1. Now that we have the value of a, the binomial becomes (x+ frac{1}{x})(2x- frac{1}{x})^{5}, and we need to find the constant term. The constant term in the expansion of a binomial expression (A+B)^n will come from the term where the powers of x cancel out. In this case, we need to consider terms from (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} that, when multiplied by x or frac{1}{x}, will yield a power of x^0 (which is 1). To find the constant term from the binomial (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5}, we should look at the general term of the binomial expansion (2x- frac{1}{x})^{n}: T_{k+1} = binom{n}{k}(2x)^{n-k}left(-frac{1}{x}right)^{k}. For n=5, the powers of x cancel out, i.e., x^{5-k-k}=x^0, when k=3. Therefore, substituting k=3 and n=5 into T_{k+1}, we get: T_{4} = binom{5}{3}(2x)^{2}left(-frac{1}{x}right)^{3} = 10 cdot 4x^2 cdot -frac{1}{x^3}. The constant term is therefore: T_{4}^{text{const}} = 10 cdot 4 cdot -1 = -40. However, this is not the final answer yet. We need to remember that the original problem had (x+frac{1}{x}) as a factor as well. The term that we just found must be multiplied by the constant term from (x+frac{1}{x}), which is 2 (1 from x and 1 from frac{1}{x}). Thus, we have: text{Constant term} = -40 cdot 2 = -80. But upon reviewing, we realize that the final constant term cannot be negative since the magnitude of the coefficient in the term x(2x-1/x)^5 is always positive. Therefore, the calculation must be revisited. Also, the term from (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} that we're interested in would yield a positive constant when x is multiplied by (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5}. So, let's find the correct constant term without including the -1 factor from the previous step: T_{4}^{text{const}} = 10 cdot 4 = 40. This time, multiplying by the constant term from (x+frac{1}{x}) gives us: text{Constant term} = 40 cdot 2 = 80. But this is too high, indicating a mistake in our calculation. The correct approach to find the constant term T_k in the expansion (x+frac{1}{x})(2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} when a=1 involves choosing terms in the expansion of (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} that, when multiplied by x or frac{1}{x} from the other factor, result in no remaining x factors. Thus, we have to look at the terms in the expansion of (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} which contain x^3 and x^2 respectively, as those will be the ones to cancel out with the x and frac{1}{x} in the other factor. The term in the expansion of (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} that contains x^3 will come from taking three factors of -frac{1}{x} and two factors of 2x, which corresponds with the term given by C_5^3(2x)^2(-frac{1}{x})^3. Simplifying, we get 10 cdot 4 cdot (-1)^3 = -40. The term in the expansion of (2x-frac{1}{x})^{5} that contains x^2 comes from taking two factors of -frac{1}{x} and three factors of 2x, corresponding with the term given by C_5^2 (2x)^3 (-frac{1}{x})^2. Simplifying, we get 10 cdot 8 cdot (-1)^2 = 80. Hence the constant term is the sum of these two parts: text{Constant term} = -40 + 80 = 40.

Given that the Euler line of triangle ABC is the perpendicular bisector of BC and knowing the slope of BC is -1, the slope of the Euler line, being perpendicular, will be the negative reciprocal, which is 1. 3. **Equation of the Euler Line**: The equation of the line with slope 1 passing through the midpoint of BC can be written as y - frac{1}{2} = 1 cdot (x - frac{3}{2}), simplifying to y - x = -1 or x - y - 1 = 0. 4. **Distance from Circle Center to Euler Line**: The circle M is centered at (3,0), and the Euler line is x - y - 1 = 0.

Setting the two rates equal to each other, we get: [ frac{3}{R} = frac{1}{12} ] To find ( R ), we can solve for it: [ 3 = frac{R}{12} ] [ R = 3 times 12 ] [ R = 36 ] So, Ram would take boxed{36} days to complete the task if he worked alone."},{"prompt":"There are 26 positive integers d between 200 and 300 (both inclusive) that are not divisible by a certain number, 3, or 5. What is the first number that these integers are not divisible by?","completion":"To find the first number that these 26 positive integers between 200 and 300 are not divisible by, we need to consider the prime numbers greater than 5, since we already know they are not divisible by 3 or 5. The prime numbers greater than 5 and less than 26 (since there are 26 integers we are considering) are: 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, and 23. We can start by checking the smallest prime number in the list, which is 7, to see if it is a divisor of any of the integers between 200 and 300. If we find that all 26 integers are not divisible by 7, then 7 is the first number that these integers are not divisible by. If some of the 26 integers are divisible by 7, we move on to the next prime number, which is 11, and repeat the process. Let's start by checking divisibility by 7. The smallest multiple of 7 between 200 and 300 is 203 (7 * 29), and the largest is 294 (7 * 42). If we list out the multiples of 7 in this range: 203, 210, 217, 224, 231, 238, 245, 252, 259, 266, 273, 280, 287, 294 We can see that there are 14 multiples of 7 between 200 and 300. Since we are looking for 26 integers that are not divisible by 7, 3, or 5, and we already know that they are not divisible by 3 or 5, we can conclude that 7 is the first number that these 26 integers are not divisible by. Therefore, the first number that these 26 positive integers between 200 and 300 are not divisible by is boxed{7} ."},{"prompt":"f r is the remainder when each of the numbers 1259, 1567, and 2257 is divided by d, where d is an integer greater than 1, then dr equals?

Subtract congruence (i) from (ii) to eliminate r: [ 1567 - 1259 equiv r - r pmod{d} implies 308 equiv 0 pmod{d} ] This tells us that d divides 308. 3. Subtract congruence (ii) from (iii) to eliminate r: [ 2257 - 1567 equiv r - r pmod{d} implies 690 equiv 0 pmod{d} ] This tells us that d also divides 690. 4. We need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 308 and 690 since d must divide both. Factorizing both numbers: [ 308 = 2^2 times 7 times 11 ] [ 690 = 2 times 3 times 5 times 23 ] The common factor here is 2. 5. Since d divides both 308 and 690, and their only common factor is 2, we conclude that d = 2. 6. Substitute d = 2 back into any of the original congruences to find r.
