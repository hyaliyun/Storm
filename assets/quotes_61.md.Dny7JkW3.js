The conclusion is trivially true since the single number can form one group of sum (m). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume the statement is true for all values less than (n). That is, if the summation of some lesser number of terms (1 + 2 + cdots + n') equals (mk') for (n' < n), then the numbers can be partitioned into (k') groups each having sum (m). 3. **Considering (S_n = {1, 2, cdots, n})** We need to analyze the set (S_n = {1, 2, cdots, n}) under the conditions given in the problem. - **Case (m = n):** If (m = n), then ( frac{1}{2}(n+1) = k ) is an integer.

(2) Prove: frac{1}{e^{2x_{1}}}+frac{1}{e^{2x_{2}}}>frac{2}{a}.","completion":"**Solution:** **(1)** To find the range of real number a, we start by differentiating the given function f(x): f'(x) = (2x-1) cdot 2e^{2x} + e^{2x} - frac{4}{3}a cdot 3x^2 = 4x(e^{2x}-ax). Given that f(x) has two extreme points on the interval (0,+infty), the derivative f'(x)=0 must have two distinct real roots in this interval. Since 4x > 0 for x > 0, we focus on the equation e^{2x}-ax=0. Let's define h(x) = e^{2x}-ax for x > 0. For h(x) to have two zeros, its derivative must change signs: h'(x) = 2e^{2x}-a. Since e^{2x} > 1 for x > 0, we have 2e^{2x} > 2, implying that for a leq 2, h'(x) > 0, which means h(x) is strictly increasing and cannot have two zeros. Thus, a must be greater than 2. When a > 2, the critical point of h(x) is found by setting h'(x)=0: 2e^{2x} = a Rightarrow x = frac{1}{2}lnfrac{a}{2}. Analyzing the behavior of h(x) around this critical point, we find that h(x) decreases before and increases after this point. Evaluating h(x) at x=0 and x=frac{1}{2}lnfrac{a}{2} gives: h(0) = 1, quad hleft(frac{1}{2}lnfrac{a}{2}right) = frac{a}{2}(1-lnfrac{a}{2}). For 2 < a leq 2e, hleft(frac{1}{2}lnfrac{a}{2}right) geq 0, which contradicts the requirement for two zeros. For a > 2e, hleft(frac{1}{2}lnfrac{a}{2}right) < 0, which is consistent with having two zeros. Further analysis shows that h(ln a) = a(a-ln a) > 0 for a > 2e. Thus, the range of a is: boxed{a > 2e}. **(2)** Assuming 0 < x_{1} < x_{2}, we have: left{begin{array}{l} e^{2x_{1}}=ax_{1} e^{2x_{2}}=ax_{2} end{array}right.. To prove frac{1}{e^{2x_{1}}}+frac{1}{e^{2x_{2}}}>frac{2}{a}, we show that: frac{1}{ax_{1}}+frac{1}{ax_{2}}>frac{2}{a} Leftrightarrow x_{1}+x_{2} > 2x_{1}x_{2}. From the given equations, we derive: left{begin{array}{l} 2x_{1}=ln a+ln x_{1} 2x_{2}=ln a+ln x_{2} end{array}right., leading to ln x_{2}-ln x_{1}=2(x_{2}-x_{1}) > 0. We need to show: frac{x_{2}^2-x_{1}^2}{x_{1}x_{2}} > lnfrac{x_{2}}{x_{1}} Leftrightarrow t-frac{1}{t}-ln t > 0, where t=frac{x_{2}}{x_{1}} > 1. Let varphi(t)=t-frac{1}{t}-ln t, then: varphi'(t)=1+frac{1}{t^2}-frac{1}{t}=frac{t^2-t+1}{t^2} > 0. Since varphi(t) is increasing for t > 1, and varphi(1)=0, we conclude that varphi(t) > 0 for t > 1.

Differentiate f(x) with respect to x: [ f'(x) = 2 - frac{2}{x^2} - frac{a}{x} ] 2. For f(x) to be monotonically increasing on left[1,+infty right), we need f'(x) geq 0.

Let h(x) = 2x - frac{2}{x}, and note that h(x) is monotonically increasing on left[1,+infty right). To find the minimum value of h(x), we evaluate it at x=1: [ h(1) = 2(1) - frac{2}{1} = 0 ] 4.

For g(x) to have a minimum value, we first consider the sign of g'(x). If a leq 0, g'(x) geq 0 always holds, which contradicts the existence of a minimum value. Therefore, a > 0. 4. Setting g'(x) = 0 to find critical points, we get: [ 6x^2 - a = 0 Rightarrow x = sqrt{frac{a}{6}} ] We discard negative values since x > 0. 5. Analyzing the behavior of g(x) around the critical point, we find g(x) is decreasing on (0, sqrt{frac{a}{6}}) and increasing on (sqrt{frac{a}{6}}, +infty). Thus, x = sqrt{frac{a}{6}} is the point of local minimum and also the global minimum on the given interval. 6. To find the minimum value of g(x), we substitute x = sqrt{frac{a}{6}} into g(x) and set it equal to -6: [ gleft(sqrt{frac{a}{6}}right) = -6 ] Solving this equation leads to a = 6.

The probability of selection for any individual is indeed frac{n}{N}, showing that each individual has the same likelihood of being in the sample. In systematic sampling, although the starting point is usually chosen randomly, every k-th individual is selected (where k is typically N/n).

For stratified sampling, the population is divided into subgroups (strata) that are internally homogenous but heterogenous among each other. Samples are drawn from each stratum, often proportional to stratum size. If the sampling within strata is random and proportional to the strata's sizes, every individual will still have an equal probability of being selected.

Considering all these factors, what % of Juan's total income is the sum of Mary's, Lisa's, and Nina's total incomes?","completion":"Let's break down the information given step by step and use a variable to represent Juan's base income. Let's say Juan's base income is J. 1. Tim's base income is 30% less than Juan's, so Tim's base income is J - 0.30J = 0.70J. 2. Mary's income is 60% more than Tim's base income, so Mary's base income is 0.70J + 0.60 * 0.70J = 0.70J + 0.42J = 1.12J. Mary also receives a 10% bonus, so her total income is 1.12J + 0.10 * 1.12J = 1.12J + 0.112J = 1.232J. 3. Lisa's base income is 10% less than Tim's, so Lisa's base income is 0.70J - 0.10 * 0.70J = 0.70J - 0.07J = 0.63J. Lisa also has 3% overtime pay, so her total income is 0.63J + 0.03 * 0.63J = 0.63J + 0.0189J = 0.6489J. 4. Lisa's base income is also 15% more than Alan's, so Alan's base income is 0.63J / 1.15 = 0.547826J. Alan has an 8% tax deduction, so his total income is 0.547826J - 0.08 * 0.547826J = 0.547826J - 0.043826J = 0.504J. 5. Nina's base income is 25% more than Juan's, so Nina's base income is J + 0.25J = 1.25J. Nina's base income is also 20% less than Alan's base income, so we have another equation: 1.25J = 0.547826J - 0.20 * 0.547826J. However, this information is not needed to solve the problem, as we are looking for the sum of Mary's, Lisa's, and Nina's total incomes as a percentage of Juan's total income. 6. Nina also receives a 7% bonus, so her total income is 1.25J + 0.07 * 1.25J = 1.25J + 0.0875J = 1.3375J. Now, let's sum up Mary's, Lisa's, and Nina's total incomes and find the percentage of Juan's total income: Mary + Lisa + Nina = 1.232J + 0.6489J + 1.3375J = 3.2184J. To find this sum as a percentage of Juan's total income, we divide by J and multiply by 100%: (3.2184J / J) * 100% = 321.84%. Therefore, the sum of Mary's, Lisa's, and Nina's total incomes is boxed{321.84%} of Juan's total income."},{"prompt":"Two pedestrians are walking towards each other along a straight road at a speed of 5 km/h.

Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. **Given Condition and Initial Implications**: - We start with the given condition tan Btan C > 1 > 0. - Since tan Btan C > 0, both B and C must be acute angles. This is because the tangent of an acute angle is positive. Thus, we have tan B > 0 and tan C > 0. 2. **Implication on Angle A**: - We know that in any triangle, the sum of angles is pi radians. Therefore, A = pi - (B + C). - The tangent of the sum of angles B and C can be expressed as tan(B + C) = frac{tan B + tan C}{1 - tan Btan C}. Since B and C are acute, B + C is an obtuse angle, and thus tan(B + C) < 0. - This implies tan(pi - A) = tan(B + C) < 0, which further implies tan A > 0 since tan(pi - x) = -tan(x). Therefore, A is also an acute angle. 3. **Conclusion for triangle ABC**: - Since all angles A, B, and C are acute, triangle ABC is an acute-angled triangle. - Conversely, if triangle ABC is an acute-angled triangle, then A, B, and C are all acute, implying B + C is obtuse. Thus, tan(B + C) < 0, which leads to frac{tan B + tan C}{1 - tan Btan C} < 0. Given tan B > 0 and tan C > 0, it follows that 1 - tan Btan C < 0, which means tan Btan C > 1. Therefore, the condition \\"tan Btan C > 1\\" is both necessary and sufficient for triangle ABC to be an acute-angled triangle.

However, for ( n > 3 ), the condition that every pair of points in ( S ) forms a side of a regular polygon becomes increasingly restrictive. 6. **Check for contradictions**: - For ( n = 4 ) (a square), not every pair of points forms a side of a regular polygon. For example, the diagonal of a square is not a side of any regular polygon with vertices in ( S ). - For ( n = 5 ) or more, similar contradictions arise because the distances between non-adjacent vertices do not correspond to the sides of any regular polygon. 7. **Conclude the possible values**: - The only configuration that satisfies the given condition for all pairs of points is when ( S ) forms an equilateral triangle.

Sufficiency: Assuming that the first four terms of {a_n} form an arithmetic sequence with common difference d, consider n le k+3 for k = 1, we find that a_4 = a_1 + 3d, a_3 = a_1 + 2d, and a_2 = a_1 + d. Suppose that {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence for n le k+3 for k > 1, we have a_{k+3} = a_k + 3d, a_{k+2} = a_k + 2d, and a_{k+1} = a_k + d. For n = k+4, the condition that {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence gives us b_{k+2} + b_k = 2b_{k+1}. Putting this together: a_{k+4} = frac{3a_{k+2}a_{k+3} - 3a_{k+1}a_{k+2} + a_ka_{k+1}}{a_{k+3}} = frac{a_k^2 + 7a_kd + 12d^2}{a_k + 3d} = a_k + 4d Therefore, a_{k+4} - a_{k+3} = d and boxed{a_{k+4} = a_k + 4d}, showing that {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence."},{"prompt":"Expand the following expression: 20(3x 4)","completion":"To solve the problem, we use the distributive property.

Consequently, the number of vans will be (10 - x), since the total number of vehicles to be purchased is 10. Given that each sedan costs 70,000 and each van costs 40,000, and the company can invest up to 550,000, we can set up the following inequality to represent the total cost: [70,000x + 40,000(10 - x) leq 550,000] Dividing the entire inequality by 10,000 to simplify, we get: [7x + 4(10 - x) leq 55] Expanding and simplifying this inequality: [7x + 40 - 4x leq 55] [3x leq 15] [x leq 5] However, since the company must purchase at least 3 sedans, we have x geq 3.

Let ( T ) be a triangle in the plane whose vertices are lattice points, but with no other lattice points on its sides. Furthermore, suppose ( T ) contains exactly four lattice points in its interior. Prove that these four points lie on a straight line.","completion":": 1. **Understand the Problem Statement**: We need to prove that four lattice points inside a triangle T, which has vertex coordinates as lattice points and no other lattice points on its sides, lie on a straight line. 2. **Basic Setup**: Let the vertices of the triangle T be (A=(x_1, y_1)), (B=(x_2, y_2)), and (C=(x_3, y_3)). 3. **Area Calculation Using Determinant**: The area of triangle T can be computed using the determinant formula: [ 2 times [ABC] = left| begin{array}{cc} x_2 - x_1 & x_3 - x_1 y_2 - y_1 & y_3 - y_1 end{array} right| ] Given that (2 times [ABC] = 9): [ left| begin{array}{cc} x_2 - x_1 & x_3 - x_1 y_2 - y_1 & y_3 - y_1 end{array} right| = 9 ] 4. **Modulo 3 Analysis**: Consider the determinant modulo 3. The area becomes: [ left| begin{array}{cc} x_2 - x_1 & x_3 - x_1 y_2 - y_1 & y_3 - y_1 end{array} right| equiv 0 pmod{3} ] This means that the vectors (mathbf{u} = (x_2-x_1, y_2-y_1)) and (mathbf{v} = (x_3-x_1, y_3-y_1)) are linearly dependent over mathbb{Z}/3mathbb{Z}. 5. **Implication of Linear Dependence**: If the vectors are linearly dependent and not zero vectors, then (mathbf{u} = -mathbf{v} pmod{3}). This ensures that the sum of the coordinates modulo 3 gives: [ (x_1 + x_2 + x_3, y_1 + y_2 + y_3) equiv (0, 0) pmod{3} ] Meaning the centroid (G = left(frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3}right)) is a lattice point. 6. **Subdivide Triangle T By its Centroid**: Consider the triangle triangle ABG with vertices A, B, and G. The area of this triangle is: [ [ABG] = frac{1}{3} [ABC] = frac{9}{2} = 1.5 ] 7. **Applying Pick's Theorem**: By Pick's Theorem: [ text{Area} = I + frac{B}{2} - 1 ] where I is the number of interior lattice points and B is the number of boundary lattice points. Solving for triangle ABG: [ frac{3}{2} = I + frac{B}{2} - 1 ] Rearranging gives: [ 1.5 = I + frac{B}{2} - 1 implies 2.5 = I + frac{B}{2} ] 8. **Analysis of Cases**: - **Case 1**: If (triangle ABG) has one interior lattice point and no additional lattice points on its boundary (except vertices). Repeating the modulo 3 argument shows that the centroid (G_1) of triangle ABG must also be a lattice point. The four collinear lattice points inside T would now be at (G_1 + k(G - G_1)) for (k=0,1,2,3), making them collinear. - **Case 2**: If (triangle ABG) has two lattice points on its boundary. The lattice points on the boundary are likely midpoints or trisection points of AG and BG. This implies regular intervals for these lattice points. If extending the intervals results in another lattice point inside T, it would form four collinear lattice points inside T. 9. **Conclusion**: By considering the implications of lattice point alignment and properties of subdivisions by the centroid (G), we conclude that the mentioned four interior lattice points must lie on a straight line. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Musa is the class teacher of a class with some students.

Let's divide equation (2) by equation (1): 8200000 / 40000 = (P * (200y + y^2)) / (Py) 205 = 200 + y y = 205 - 200 y = 5 Now that we have the value of y, we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find P: 40000 = P * 5 P = 40000 / 5 P = 8000 Therefore, the amount invested is boxed{8000} ."},{"prompt":"Georgia has 25 pieces of stationery while Lorene has a certain number of pieces of stationery.

After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the ray CA ends up 90 degrees clockwise from its original position. - Initially, CB is assumed to be along the 0-degree line and CA is at 30 degrees to it. - After rotation, CA is at 30 - 90 = -60 degrees (or equivalently, at 360 - 60 = 300 degrees in standard position). 3. **Calculate Acute Angle**: The angle between CB (0 degrees) and CA (now effectively at 300 degrees) is 360 - 300 = 60 degrees.

Therefore, (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 equiv 0 pmod{2}). This implies that (a, b, c) must all be even or all be odd. If any of (a, b, c) were of different parity, their squares would not sum to an even number. Hence, (a, b, c) are either all even or all odd. If (a, b, c) are all even, then (a^3, b^3, c^3) are also even, and their sum (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) is even, i.e., (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 equiv 0 pmod{2}). If (a, b, c) are all odd, then (a^3, b^3, c^3) are also odd, and their sum (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) is odd, i.e., (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 equiv 1 + 1 + 1 equiv 3 equiv 1 pmod{2}). This contradicts the fact that (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) is even. Therefore, (a, b, c) must be all even, and (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 equiv 0 pmod{2}). 2. **Divisibility by 3:** Since (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) is divisible by 6, it is also divisible by 3. Therefore, (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 equiv 0 pmod{3}). Additionally, since (ab + bc + ca) is divisible by 3, we have (ab + bc + ca equiv 0 pmod{3}). We need to show that (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) is divisible by 3. Using the identity: [ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) ] Since (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 equiv 0 pmod{3}) and (ab + bc + ca equiv 0 pmod{3}), we have: [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca equiv 0 - 0 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Therefore, the right-hand side of the identity is divisible by 3: [ (a+b+c) cdot 0 equiv 0 pmod{3} ] Hence, (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 equiv 3abc pmod{3}). Since (a, b, c) are integers, (3abc) is divisible by 3, and thus (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 equiv 0 pmod{3}). 3. **Combining both results:** We have shown that (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 equiv 0 pmod{2}) and (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 equiv 0 pmod{3}).

To find out how many exercise books can be bought with 24 yuan at most, we establish equations based on the equal relationships described in the problem for both store A and store B.

This problem tests the practical application of linear equations by identifying the quantitative relationships implied in the problem and solving it through establishing and solving equations. - For store A, the cost for the first 10 books is 10 times 1 = 10 yuan, and the cost for the remaining 12 books is 12 times 1 times 0.7 = 8.4 yuan. So, the total cost at store A is 10 + 8.4 = 18.4 yuan. - For store B, the cost for all 22 books is 22 times 1 times 0.85 = 18.7 yuan.

The second car started at 9:10 a.m. and caught up at 10:30 a.m., which is a time difference of 1 hour and 20 minutes, or 1 + 20/60 = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3 hours. During this time, the first car continued to travel at 30 mph. So, the distance the first car traveled in 4/3 hours is: Distance = Speed × Time Distance = 30 mph × (4/3) hours Distance = 40 miles Since the first car was already 5 miles ahead, the total distance the second car had to cover to catch up is 40 miles + 5 miles = 45 miles. Now, we can calculate the speed of the second car. It covered 45 miles in 4/3 hours, so its speed is: Speed = Distance / Time Speed = 45 miles / (4/3) hours Speed = 45 miles × (3/4) hours^-1 Speed = 135/4 miles per hour Speed = 33.75 miles per hour Therefore, the second car was going at a speed of boxed{33.75} miles per hour."},{"prompt":"Given a natural number ( n geq 2 ), let ( d(n) ) represent the number of positive divisors of ( n ).

Set ( |a| = |c| = |z|^{frac{1}{2}} ). - With these magnitudes, the second term in the identity, ( frac{1}{2} (|c| - |a|)^2 ), becomes zero. - Thus, the identity simplifies to: |ac| - Re(ac) = frac{1}{2} |bar{c} - a|^2 Given the initial condition ( |z| - Re(z) leq frac{1}{2} ): frac{1}{2} |bar{c} - a|^2 leq frac{1}{2} Therefore: |bar{c} - a|^2 leq 1 implies |bar{c} - a| leq 1 This completes the proof that the original condition ( |z| - Re(z) leq frac{1}{2} ) is necessary and sufficient with the given condition ( |bar{c} - a| leq 1 ). # Conclusion: boxed{text{True}}"},{"prompt":"f x+y=11 and x^2y=36, find the value of x^3+y^3.","completion":"1.

We express xy and x^2 in terms of a single variable: let x = frac{36}{y}. Substituting into (x+y) gives us frac{36}{y} + y = 11. Cross-multiplying leads to 36 + y^2 = 11y. 4.

The problem presents an abstract function f(x), making it impossible to solve the inequality f(x) > x directly. However, the problem provides the condition that for any x∈R, f′(x) > 1.

Note that D is non-empty and is a union of closed intervals. 4. **Expanding to More Sets**: - Consider adding another subset E to the existing sets A, B, and C. - Since any three of these four sets must intersect, E must intersect D (since D = A cap B cap C and any three including E must have a common point). - Therefore, D cap E is non-empty. 5. **Generalizing to All Sets**: - Extend this argument to all subsets in the family. For each additional subset added to the family, it must intersect with D because any three subsets including the new one must have a common point. - Thus, every subset in the family intersects D. 6. **Finding a Point in Half the Sets**: - Since D is a union of closed intervals and every subset intersects D, there must be at least one point in D that lies in at least half of these subsets. - This is because if no such point existed, it would imply that every point in D is in fewer than half the subsets, contradicting the fact that every subset intersects D. 7. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, there exists at least one point in D which is common to at least half of the subsets in the family. boxed{text{There exists a point common to at least half of the subsets in the family.}}"},{"prompt":"Triangle X is equilateral with side length B and circumradius S, and Triangle Y is equilateral with side length b and circumradius s.

Prove that there exists positive integer c that the following statement is true: if both grasshoppers can jump from O to some point A and the second grasshopper needs n jumps to do it, then the first grasshopper can use at most n+c jumps to do so.","completion":"1. **Convex Polygon and Vector Sets**: Given a convex polygon with vertices at lattice points on a plane containing the origin ( O ). Let ( V_1 ) be the set of vectors from ( O ) to the vertices of the polygon, and ( V_2 ) be the set of vectors from ( O ) to the lattice points that lie inside or on the boundary of the polygon. Clearly, ( V_1 subseteq V_2 ). 2. **Grasshopper Jumps**: Two grasshoppers jump on the plane: the first grasshopper uses vectors from ( V_1 ), and the second uses vectors from ( V_2 ). We need to prove that there exists a positive integer ( c ) such that if both grasshoppers can jump from ( O ) to some point ( A ) and the second grasshopper needs ( n ) jumps to do it, then the first grasshopper can use at most ( n + c ) jumps to do so. 3. **Representation of Vectors in ( V_2 )**: Since the polygon is convex, for any ( v in V_2 ), we can write: [ v = alpha v' + beta v'' ] where ( v', v'' in V_1 ), and ( alpha, beta ) are non-negative reals such that ( alpha + beta leq 1 ). Moreover, since ( V_2 ) is a finite set, we can assume that ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are rational numbers with a common denominator ( N ). 4. **Lattice Point Representation**: Suppose a lattice point ( w ) can be reached by both grasshoppers. Let the second grasshopper reach ( w ) in ( n ) jumps, i.e., [ w = sum_{v in V_2} a_v cdot v ] where ( a_v ) are non-negative integers with ( sum_{v in V_2} a_v = n ). 5. **Decomposition of ( w )**: Represent each ( v in V_2 ) as in the previous step: [ w = sum_{v in V_1} alpha_v v ] where ( alpha_v ) are non-negative rationals with denominator ( N ) and ( sum_{v in V_1} alpha_v leq n ). 6. **Floor and Fractional Parts**: Let ( b_v = lfloor alpha_v rfloor ) and ( c_v = {alpha_v} ) for ( v in V_1 ). Define: [ w_1 = sum_{v in V_1} b_v v quad text{and} quad w_2 = sum_{v in V_1} c_v v ] It is clear that the first grasshopper can reach ( w_1 ) in at most ( n ) jumps. 7. **Claim**: If ( w ) and ( w_1 ) are lattice points reachable by the first grasshopper, then ( w - w_1 ) is also reachable by the first grasshopper. 8. **Proof of the Claim**: We have: [ w - w_1 = sum_{v in V_1} a_v v ] where ( a_v ) are integers (not necessarily positive). Since ( 0 ) is inside the given polygon, it can be represented as: [ 0 = sum_{v in V_1} alpha_v v ] where ( alpha_v ) are positive rationals. Multiplying this equality by some integer, we can assume ( alpha_v ) are positive integers. Adding this representation to both sides of the previous equation as many times as needed, we get a representation of ( w - w_1 ) with all coefficients positive. Thus, ( w - w_1 ) is reachable by the first grasshopper. 9. **Reaching ( w_2 )**: Using the above claim, ( w_2 ) is also attainable by the first grasshopper. Since all possible values of ( w_2 ) are finite (its coefficients are small rational numbers with denominator ( N )), there is a constant ( c ) (depending only on ( V_2 )) such that the first grasshopper can reach ( w_2 ) with at most ( c ) hops. 10. **Conclusion**: From ( w = w_1 + w_2 ), it follows that ( w ) is attainable by the first grasshopper in at most ( n + c ) jumps.

Thus, we simplify: [ 512a + 64b + 24 + c equiv 24 + c pmod{16} ] Since 512a and 64b are multiples of 16, they vanish modulo 16. Simplifying further: [ 24 + c equiv 8 + c pmod{16} ] because 24 equiv 8 pmod{16}. 4. **Perfect square condition**: We know that a perfect square modulo 16 can only be 0, 1, 4, 9. Therefore, we need: [ 8 + c equiv 0, 1, 4, 9 pmod{16} ] 5. **Solving for c**: - If 8 + c equiv 0 pmod{16}, then c equiv -8 equiv 8 pmod{16}, which is not possible since c must be a digit in base 8 (i.e., 0 leq c leq 7). - If 8 + c equiv 1 pmod{16}, then c equiv 1 - 8 equiv -7 equiv 9 pmod{16}, which is also not possible for the same reason. - If 8 + c equiv 4 pmod{16}, then c equiv 4 - 8 equiv -4 equiv 12 pmod{16}, which is again not possible. - If 8 + c equiv 9 pmod{16}, then c equiv 9 - 8 equiv 1 pmod{16}, which is valid since c = 1 fits the range of base 8 digits. 6. **Conclusion**: The only value of c that satisfies the condition of the number being a perfect square is c = 1.

Therefore, we can write: sqrt[4]{left(1 + sqrt[5]{x^4}right)^3} = left(1 + left(x^4right)^{1/5}right)^{3/4} = left(1 + x^{4/5}right)^{3/4}. 2. **Simplify the denominator:** - Rewriting (sqrt[5]{x^2}) as ( x^{2/5} ), we get: x^2 cdot sqrt[5]{x^2} = x^2 cdot x^{2/5} = x^{2 + 2/5} = x^{10/5 + 2/5} = x^{12/5}. 3. **Combine the expressions:** - The integrand now looks like: frac{left(1 + x^{4/5}right)^{3/4}}{x^{12/5}}. 4. **Rewrite the integrand:** - We can rewrite the expression as multiplying powers of (x): frac{left(1 + x^{4/5}right)^{3/4}}{x^{12/5}} = left(1 + x^{4/5}right)^{3/4} cdot x^{-12/5}. 5. **Separate the terms inside the integral:** - Let's use a substitution to simplify integrating this combination.

We aim to prove that the sum of these (l_j) values is at most (mn). 2. **Lemma:** Given positive integers (m, n) and a sequence (a_1, a_2, ldots) of integers in ([0, m-1]) such that (a_i = a_{i-n}) for all (i > n).

Clearly, (mathbb{N}) is a disjoint union of (T_0, ldots, T_{m-1}). - Fix (r).

Let (T_r cap [1, n] = {c_1 < ldots < c_k}). - By definition of (l_j) and periodicity of (a_i), we have (l_{c_i} = c_{i+1} - c_i) for (i < k) and (l_{c_k} = n + c_1 - c_k). - Summing these, we get: [ sum_{j in T_r cap [1, n]} l_j = sum_{i=1}^k l_{c_i} = sum_{i=1}^{k-1} (c_{i+1} - c_i) + n + c_1 - c_k = n. ] - Therefore, (sum_{j=1}^n l_j = sum_{r=0}^{m-1} sum_{j in T_r cap [1, n]} l_j leq sum_{r=0}^{m-1} n = mn). 4. **Back to the Main Problem:** - Extend the definition of (l_j) for every (j in mathbb{N}) as the smallest positive integer such that (m mid a_j + a_{j+1} + ldots + a_{j+l_j-1}). This way ({l_j}) has period (n). - Define a sequence ({b_j}) of integers in ([0, m-1]) by: [ b_j = sum_{i=1}^{j-1} a_i mod m, ] where (b_1 = 0). - By definition, (l_j) is the smallest positive integer such that (b_{j+l_j} = b_j). - For every (j in mathbb{N}), we have: [ b_{j+mn} - b_j equiv sum_{i=j}^{j+mn-1} a_i = m sum_{i=1}^n a_i equiv 0 pmod{m}. ] - Therefore, ({b_j}) has period (mn).

For the function to have a zero point but no extreme values in the interval left(frac{π}{2}, piright), the half-period frac{T}{2}=frac{π}{omega} must be at least as large as the length of the interval, which is pi - frac{π}{2} = frac{π}{2}.

Solving for x gives us the general formula for the zero points in terms of omega and k. 3. **Applying the Interval Constraints**: We apply the interval constraints to the formula for zero points. For the function to have a zero point in the interval without extreme values, we consider the conditions: [ kpi +frac{π}{2} leqslant omega cdot frac{π}{2}-frac{π}{6} < kpi +pi ] and [ kpi +pi < omega cdot pi -frac{π}{6} leqslant kpi +frac{3π}{2} ] Simplifying these inequalities gives us: [ 2k+frac{4}{3} leqslant omega < 2k+frac{7}{3} ] and [ k+frac{7}{6} < omega leqslant k+frac{5}{3} ] 4. **Determining the Range of omega**: By setting k=0, we find the range of omega as: [ [frac{4}{3}, frac{5}{3}] ] And by setting k=-1, we find another range for omega as: [ (frac{1}{6}, frac{1}{3}) ] 5. **Combining the Ranges**: Therefore, combining the ranges obtained for omega, we get: [ (frac{1}{6}, frac{1}{3}) cup [frac{4}{3}, frac{5}{3}] ] Hence, the range of omega is boxed{(frac{1}{6}, frac{1}{3}) cup [frac{4}{3}, frac{5}{3}]}."},{"prompt":"regular hexagon ABCDEF, points P and Q are the midpoints of sides overline{BC} and overline{EF} respectively.

If any element of S is removed, then the remaining integers can be divided into two collections with the same size and the same sum. Show that all elements of S are equal.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** The problem states that removing any element from the set ( S ) allows the remaining elements to be divided into two subsets with equal size and equal sum. We need to show that under these conditions, all elements of ( S ) are equal. 2. **Initial Observations:** Let's denote the finite set of integers by ( S ). If we remove an element ( x ) from ( S ), the remaining set ( S' = S setminus { x } ) can be split into two subsets ( A ) and ( B ) such that: [ |A| = |B| quad text{and} quad sum_{a in A} a = sum_{b in B} b ] Here, ( |A| ) and ( |B| ) denote the cardinalities (sizes) of the subsets, and the sums denote the sums of elements within those subsets. 3. **Transforming Elements:** To simplify the problem, we consider the transformation ( ax + b ) where ( a ) and ( b ) are chosen such that all elements become positive. By setting sufficiently large ( b ), we ensure this. 4. **Establishing Property ( X ):** Let's define property ( X ) for a set ( S ) as follows: - All elements are positive integers. - The set retains the original problem's property (removal of any element allows splitting the remaining into two equal sum and equal size subsets). - Not all elements of ( S ) are equal. 5. **Redefining in terms of ( f(S) ):** Denote ( f(S) ) as the sum of the elements in set ( S ). We analyze a set ( S ) initially with property ( X ). 6. **Parity Consideration:** Observation: For any element ( x ) in ( S ), ( f(S) - x ) must be even (since ( A ) and ( B ) should have equal sums): [ f(S setminus {x}) = f(S) - x quad text{is even} implies x quad text{has same parity as} quad f(S) ] Hence, all elements of ( S ) have the same parity. 7. **Forming a New Set ( T ):** Depending on the parity: - If all elements in ( S ) are even, form ( T = left{ frac{x}{2} mid x in S right} ). - If all elements in ( S ) are odd, form ( T = left{ frac{x+1}{2} mid x in S right} ). 8. **Properties of ( T ):** ( T ) remains a set of positive integers, and it retains properties (equal sum and equal size on removal of any element), ensuring that ( T ) has property ( X ). 9. **Reduction Argument:** Compare sums: - For ( T ), ( f(T) < f(S) ) (since ( x/2 < x ) and ( (x+1)/2 < x ) unless ( x = 1 )). - Elements of ( S ) are not all equal implies at least one element will be reduced on transformation, ensuring ( f(T) < f(S) ). 10. **Contradiction and Conclusion:** This process implies an infinite reduction sequence of ( f ), which contradicts finiteness (as ( f(S) ) is initially positive and integral). Therefore, our initial assumption that not all elements of ( S ) are equal must be false. Thus, it concludes that all elements in ( S ) must be equal.

Our objective is to prove that there exists a set of four vertices such that all edges between these vertices are of the same color. 1. **Initial assumption**: Take an arbitrary vertex ( v ) in the graph ( K_{18} ). This vertex ( v ) is connected to the remaining 17 vertices by 17 different edges. 2. **Pigeonhole Principle application**: By the pigeonhole principle, the edges connecting ( v ) to the other 17 vertices must include at least (leftlceil frac{17}{2} rightrceil = 9) edges of the same color.

This induced subgraph is a complete graph on 9 vertices where each edge is either red or blue. 4. **Ramsey's Theorem application**: Next, we apply Ramsey's theorem (specifically ( R(3,3) = 6 )) which states that any complete graph of 6 vertices, with edges arbitrarily colored with two colors, contains at least one monochromatic triangle. Here, the complete graph ( K_9 ) contains ( binom{9}{4} = 126 ) subsets of 4 vertices. By Ramsey's theorem, within this ( K_9 ), we can guarantee the existence of a monochromatic triangle. 5. **Finding 4-clique**: By extending the result, since ( K_9 ) has more vertices than the minimum required by ( R(4,4) = 18 ), it is guaranteed within ( K_9 ) with each edge being either red or blue, there exists a monochromatic ( K_4 ) (a 4-clique). This means there exist four vertices within ( S ) such that the edges between any pair of these vertices are of the same color. 6. **Conclusion**: We have shown that any 18-vertex complete graph, with edges colored either red or blue, will necessarily contain a monochromatic ( K_4 ) (four vertices all connected by edges of the same color).

However, within this unit, person A and person B can switch places, so we multiply by A_{2}^{2}. Therefore, there are A_{2}^{2} cdot A_{4}^{4} = 48 ways where person A and person B are adjacent. 3. Subtract the number of arrangements where person A and person B are adjacent from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where there is at least one person between person A and person B. This gives us 120 - 48 = boxed{72}. This problem primarily tests the application of permutations, combinations, and the two basic principles. The problem of adjacency can be solved using the bundling method, making it a moderately difficult problem."},{"prompt":"There are 7 players in a bowling team with an average weight of 103 kg.

Since overline{DE} parallel overline{AC} and overline{EF} parallel overline{AB}, triangles triangle ADE and triangle AEF are similar to triangle ABC by AA similarity criterion. 3.

A good candidate is the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the integers on the longest diagonal of the board. 3. **Analyze the effect of the action on the diagonal**: - Consider a square on the diagonal. When we perform the action on this square, the integer in this square decreases by the number of its neighbors, and each neighbor's integer increases by 1. - If the square is on the diagonal, the parity of the sum of the integers on the diagonal can change only if the number of neighbors is odd. However, for a square on the diagonal, the number of neighbors is even (2 or 3 for edge or corner squares, respectively). 4. **Construct a counterexample**: - Take any odd integer ( k ). - Place ( k ) on the longest diagonal and (-k) on the squares not on the longest diagonal. Set all other integers to zero. - The sum of the integers on the longest diagonal is ( k times n ), which is odd since ( k ) is odd and ( n ) is an integer. 5. **Prove the invariant**: - Since the sum of the integers on the longest diagonal is odd initially, it will remain odd after any number of actions because the action does not change the parity of the sum of the integers on the diagonal. - Therefore, it is impossible to make all integers zero because the sum of the integers on the diagonal would need to be even (specifically zero) for all integers to be zero. 6. **Conclusion**: Since the sum of the integers on the longest diagonal remains odd, it is impossible to turn all the integers into zeros in a finite number of actions.

First, let's find out the net increase per second. There are 86400 seconds in a day (24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds). Given that the net increase in population is 86400 people per day, the net increase per second would be: 86400 people/day ÷ 86400 seconds/day = 1 person/second Now, we know that the birth rate is 8 people every two seconds. To find the birth rate per second, we divide by 2: 8 people/2 seconds = 4 people/second Since the net increase is 1 person per second, and the birth rate is 4 people per second, we can find the death rate by subtracting the net increase from the birth rate: Death rate = Birth rate - Net increase Death rate = 4 people/second - 1 person/second Death rate = 3 people/second Now, we need to find the average death rate every two seconds.

Let's place a point (K) on the base (AD) such that (AK = BC). This means (KD = CD) because (BC + CD = AD), thus point (K) divides (AD) into two segments where (AK = BC) and (KD = CD). 3. Next, we observe that quadrilateral (ABCK) is a rhombus because (AB = BC = CK = AK) by the construction and given conditions. By the properties of a rhombus, all sides are equal. 4. Let's denote the measure of the angle ( angle CAK = alpha ). 5. Since ( angle ABC) and ( angle ACK) are angles in the rhombus, they must sum up to (180^circ). 6. Also, the opposite angles of a rhombus are equal, so we can deduce the following relationships: - ( angle AKC = angle ACK = alpha ). 7. Given (ABC) is a rhombus, the angles in a rhombus are all related such that: - ( angle KCA = angle KAC = alpha ). 8. With these angles, we can now write the angle sum for triangle (CAD): - [ angle CAD = alpha ] - [ angle CDA = alpha ] - [ angle KAD = 2alpha ]. 9. The sum of the angles in (triangle CAD) must be (180^circ): - [ alpha + alpha + 2alpha = 180^circ ] - [ 5alpha = 180^circ ] - [ alpha = 36^circ ]. 10. Knowing (alpha = 36^circ), we use it to find all angles of the trapezoid: 11. Angle ( angle A = angle CAD + angle DAK ): - [ angle A = 2alpha = 2 times 36^circ = 72^circ ] 12. Angle ( angle B = 180^circ - angle CAD = 180^circ - alpha ): - [ angle B = 180^circ - 36^circ = 144^circ ] 13. Angle ( angle C = angle DA = 36^circ): 14.

Compare the squares of a and b: Since 42 > 40, we have sqrt{42} > sqrt{40} = 2sqrt{10}. Multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2, we obtain 2sqrt{42} > 4sqrt{10} > 4sqrt{2} + 2sqrt{10}. Thus, a^2 > b^2. 4. Because a^2 > b^2 and both a and b are positive, we can conclude that a > b.

Hence, for each (x in S), there exist indices (i neq j) such that: [ A_i setminus {x} = A_j setminus {x} ] Given that the (A_i) are distinct, this can only occur if (A_j = A_i cup {x}). 3. **Graphical Representation**: Let's represent each set (A_i) as a point in a diagram.

This creates three additional triangles within ( triangle ABC ). 6. **Using the Circumradius**: Notice that any triangle inscribed in a circle with radius ( r ) will have its sides smaller than or equal to the diameter of the circle.

This can be seen by connecting the midpoints of the adjacent sides of the rectangle. Each of these segments is a line connecting the midpoint of one side of the rectangle to the midpoint of an adjacent side. This ensures that opposite sides of the newly formed quadrilateral are parallel and equal in length, thus forming a parallelogram. Specifically, since the original shape is a rectangle, the resulting parallelogram will not only be any parallelogram but a rhombus. 2. **Determining the Side Length of the Rhombus**: To find the perimeter of the rhombus, we need to calculate the length of one of its sides. This side length can be found using the properties of the rectangle. Consider the rectangle with diagonal equal to 8 units. If we split the rectangle along this diagonal, we have two congruent right triangles, each with a hypotenuse of 8. Let the lengths of the sides of the rectangle be (a) and (b). According to the Pythagorean theorem: [ a^2 + b^2 = 8^2 = 64 ] 3. **Calculating Half-Diagonals**: The distance between the midpoints of two adjacent sides of the rectangle (which forms the sides of the rhombus) is the perpendicular distance between the line segments connecting these midpoints. If we halve each side of the rectangle, the midpoints create a smaller rectangle with side lengths ( frac{a}{2} ) and ( frac{b}{2} ). 4. **Finding the Distance Between Midpoints**: Utilizing the diagonal of this smaller rectangle, which acts as the side length of the rhombus, [ text{side length of rhombus} = sqrt{ left( frac{a}{2} right)^2 + left( frac{b}{2} right)^2 } = frac{1}{2} sqrt{ a^2 + b^2 } ] Since ( a^2 + b^2 = 64 ): [ text{side length of rhombus} = frac{1}{2} sqrt{64} = frac{1}{2} times 8 = 4 ] 5. **Calculating the Perimeter of the Rhombus**: A rhombus has four sides of equal length.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Simplified Problem:** Let’s begin by considering the banker allowing each coin to be placed on the scale no more than once. What is the largest number of coins from which the counterfeit one could be identified in k weighings? Observing that if, during any weighing, more than one coin is on a pan of the scale, the counterfeit coin cannot be identified as another weighing isn't permitted. Thus, for each weighing, there should only be one coin on each pan. - If the scales are unbalanced, the lighter coin is counterfeit. - If balanced, the number of suspect coins reduces by 2. 2. **Result from Simplified Problem:** Therefore, with k weighings, we can identify the counterfeit coin among 2k+1 coins. Now, let’s apply this to the case where a coin can be weighed up to twice. 3. **Main Problem:** Let f(n) represent the maximum number of coins that can be checked in n weighings. Assume in the first weighing there are s coins on each pan. - If the scales are unbalanced, identify the counterfeit coin among the s coins on the lighter side, ensuring no coin is weighed more than once further and (n-1) weighings remain. By the simplified problem result, s leq 2(n-1)+1 = 2n-1. 4. **Balanced Scales Scenario:** If the scales are balanced, then the problem reduces to finding the counterfeit coin among the remaining f(n) - 2s coins in n-1 weighings, implying: f(n) - 2s leq f(n-1) 5. **Combining Results:** We derive the total inequality: f(n) leq f(n-1) + 2s leq f(n-1) + 2(2n-1) By iterative summation up to n, we have: f(n) leq 2(2n-1) + 2(2n-3) + ldots + 2 cdot 3 + f(1) 6. **Summing the Series:** The summation of the series 2(2n-1) + 2(2n-3) + ldots + 2 cdot 3 is the sum of an arithmetic series with first term 2(2n-1), common difference -4, and n-1 terms: text{Sum} = 2 sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (2(2n-2k+1)-1) = 2 left[ 2n(n-1) - (0 + 1 + ldots + (n-2)) right] = 2 left[ 2n(n-1) - frac{(n-2)(n-1)}{2} right] = 2 left[ 2n(n-1) - frac{n(n-1) - (n-1)}{2} right] = 2 left[ 2n(n-1) - frac{n(n-1)}{2} + frac{n-1}{2} right] = 2 left[ frac{4n(n-1) - n(n-1) + (n-1)}{2} right] = 2 left[ frac{3n(n-1) + (n-1)}{2} right] = 3n(n-1) + (n-1) = 3n^2 - 3n + n - 1 = 3n^2 - 2n - 1 Therefore: f(n) leq 2(2 n-1) + 2(2 n-3) + ldots + 2 cdot 3 + 3 = 2(n(2n-1) - 3) + 3 = 2(n^{2}+n)+1 f(n) = 2n^2+1 Therefore, the maximum number of coins for which the expert can always find the lighter counterfeit coin in n weighings, with each coin weighed no more than twice, is boxed{2n^2+1}."},{"prompt":"a circular region with radius 3 units, what is the probability that a randomly selected point within this circle will be closer to the center than it is to twice the radius of an inner concentric circle with radius 1 unit?

We can reframe this to show that the sum of an infinite arithmetic progression and an infinite non-constant geometric progression does not result in an arithmetic progression. 2. **Properties of Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions**: - An **arithmetic progression** (AP) is a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant. If a_n denotes the n-th term of an arithmetic progression, it can be written as: [ a_n = a + (n-1)d ] where a is the first term, and d is the common difference. - A **geometric progression** (GP) is a sequence where the ratio between consecutive terms is constant. If b_n denotes the n-th term of a geometric progression, it can be written as: [ b_n = b cdot q^{n-1} ] where b is the first term, and q is the common ratio. 3. **Sum of the Sequences**: - Consider the sum sequence c_n = a_n + b_n = (a + (n-1)d) + b cdot q^{n-1}. To be an arithmetic progression, the sum sequence c_n must satisfy the property: [ c_{n+1} - c_n = text{constant} ] 4. **Difference of Consecutive Terms**: - Calculate the difference between consecutive terms of the sum sequence: [ c_{n+1} = a_{n+1} + b_{n+1} = left(a + ndright) + b cdot q^n ] and [ c_n = a_n + b_n = (a + (n-1)d) + b cdot q^{n-1} ] The difference is: [ c_{n+1} - c_n = left(a + nd + b cdot q^nright) - left(a + (n-1)d + b cdot q^{n-1}right) ] Simplifying this, we get: [ c_{n+1} - c_n = d + b cdot (q^n - q^{n-1}) ] 5. **Behavior of the Difference**: - Notice that q^n - q^{n-1} = q^{n-1}(q-1). Thus: [ c_{n+1} - c_n = d + b cdot q^{n-1}(q-1) ] - For the sum sequence {c_n} to be an arithmetic progression, the term d + bq^{n-1}(q-1) must be constant, independent of n. However, since bq^{n-1}(q-1) depends on n, it cannot be constant (considering q neq 1, which corresponds to a non-constant geometric progression). 6. **Conclusion**: - Since the difference c_{n+1} - c_n is not constant, the sum sequence {c_n} is not an arithmetic progression. Therefore, the sum of an infinite arithmetic progression and an infinite non-constant geometric progression cannot form an arithmetic progression.

The ratio is: Money given to Isha : Total money given = 450 : 1650 To simplify the ratio, we divide both sides by the greatest common divisor, which is 450 in this case: 450 / 450 : 1650 / 450 = 1 : 3.66666667 So, the ratio of the money Maria gave to Isha to her total money is approximately boxed{1:3.67} ."},{"prompt":"w many sequences a_1,a_2,...,a{}_2{}_0{}_0{}_8 are there such that each of the numbers 1,2,...,2008 occurs once in the sequence, and i in (a_1,a_2,...,a_i) for each i such that 2le i le2008 ?","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to count the number of sequences ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2008} ) such that each number from 1 to 2008 appears exactly once, and for each ( i ) (where ( 2 leq i leq 2008 )), the number ( i ) appears in the first ( i ) positions of the sequence. 1. **Understanding the constraint**: - For ( i = 2 ), the number 2 must be in either position 1 or 2. - For ( i = 3 ), the number 3 must be in one of the first three positions, but since 2 has already taken one of these positions, there are two remaining choices for 3. - Generally, for each ( i ) (where ( 2 leq i leq 2008 )), the number ( i ) must be in one of the first ( i ) positions, and the previous ( i-1 ) numbers have already occupied ( i-1 ) positions, leaving exactly 2 choices for ( i ). 2. **Counting the choices**: - For ( i = 2 ), there are 2 choices for placing 2. - For ( i = 3 ), there are 2 choices for placing 3. - This pattern continues up to ( i = 2008 ). 3. **Total number of sequences**: - Since each ( i ) from 2 to 2008 has exactly 2 choices, the total number of sequences is given by: [ 2^{2008-1} = 2^{2007} ] Thus, the number of such sequences is ( 2^{2007} ).

D is the midpoint of BC. We aim to find the volume of the triangular pyramid A-B_{1}DC_{1}. First, let's calculate the area of the base triangle B_{1}DC_{1}. Since D is the midpoint of BC, BD = DC = frac{1}{2} times BC = frac{1}{2} times 2 = 1. The base B_{1}D (or DC_{1}) is thus 1 unit long. The height of this triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the equilateral triangle BCC_{1}, where the height splits BC into two equal parts and forms a right-angled triangle.

Vasya picks a pair of numbers from the board, whose greatest common divisor is greater than one, and erases one of them. What is the smallest number of numbers that Vasya can leave on the board after performing such actions?","completion":"1. Understanding the Problem: Vasya is given a list of numbers from 1 to 100. He chooses pairs of numbers such that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is greater than one. He then erases one of the numbers in each pair. Our task is to find the minimum number of numbers that can remain on the board after Vasya completes his actions. 2. Considering the Prime Factorization: For Vasya to erase a number, he needs to find two numbers that share at least one prime factor in their prime factorizations. This means that prime numbers, which have no common divisors with other prime numbers, cannot generally be paired and erased, except within their own multiples. 3. Analysis of the Bounds: - The number 1 does not affect any other number because it has no prime factors. Therefore, it remains on the board. - Prime numbers from 1 to 100 need special consideration: primes over 50 cannot be paired with any other numbers under the given range because there would be no multiples of these primes within the range. 4. Identification of Numbers Remaining: - Prime numbers greater than 50: (53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97). These are exactly 10 numbers. - Numbers containing prime factors less than or equal to 50 will remain to certain extents, as each prime will eventually narrow down pairs for itself. 5. Specific example strategy: - Vasya could pair each prime less than 50 with its multiples (e.g., (p) and (2p)). - Prime numbers like (2, 3, 5, 7) and so on, could be paired into prime-multiple pairs. - Further pairing must ensure enough primes to handle each round of erasure until only primal numbers or unique prime-comprising numbers remain. 6. Listing what remains after all pairings: - For primes such as (2, 3, 5, 7), each time a smaller pair composite gets removed until larger prime (itself free from pairs): - Composites involving higher primes follow pairing, leading to leftovers principally as those not forming a composite relationship in gcd or far exceeding differences within range of pairings. Consequently, the following 12 numbers satisfy as they remain unpaired until the final remaining step: [ 1, 2, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 ] Conclusion: Thus, the minimum number of numbers that can remain on the board through Vasya’s actions is: [boxed{12}]"},{"prompt":"During the first eleven days, 700 people responded to a survey question.

Consider the intervals: [ (-infty, c_1], [c_1, c_2], ldots, [c_{99}, c_{100}], (c_{100}, infty). ] In each of these intervals, the function ( f(x) ) is piecewise linear. 4. Evaluate the boundary behaviors: - In the interval ( (-infty, c_1] ), the function ( f(x) ) is constant: [ f(x) = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{50} - (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{50}) = m. ] - In the interval ( (c_{100}, infty) ), the function ( f(x) ) is also constant but with opposite sign: [ f(x) = -(a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{50} - (b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{50})) = -m. ] Since the total number of roots is finite, it must be that ( m neq 0 ). 5. As ( x ) progresses in each interval ( [c_i, c_{i+1}] ), the coefficients of ( x ) in ( f(x) ) change by ( pm 2 ): - When crossing ( c_i ) from left to right: [ f(x) = |x - c_i| quad text{contributes either } +1 text{ or } -1 text{ to the coefficient depending on which set it belongs to}. ] This change causes a variation of (pm 2) in the linear term's coefficient. 6. This behavior ensures that the coefficient of ( x ) in ( f(x) ) is always an odd integer (never zero within any interval). 7. Due to the above, ( f(x) ) can only switch from positive to negative (or vice versa) between adjacent intervals. Therefore, ( f(x) ) can have at most one root within each interval ( [c_1, c_2], [c_2, c_3], ldots, [c_{99}, c_{100}] ). 8. Given there are 99 intervals of the form ([c_i, c_{i+1}]) (pairwise distinct adjacent intervals): [ f(x) = 0 quad text{can thus have at most one root in each of these intervals}. ] 9. Also, considering the boundary conditions, there might be additional roots, but the sum of distinct roots remains finite and odd because ( f(c_1) ) and ( f(c_{100}) ) have opposite signs. 10. Thus, combining all insights, the maximum possible number of roots for ( f(x) = 0 ): [ 2 times 49 = 98 + 1 = 99 ] Conclusion: Therefore, the maximum number of roots is ( boxed{49} )."},{"prompt":"The equation x=1 is the ____ condition for the equation x^{2}2x+1=0.

First, note that the interval (-1, 4] includes the point x = 0, where f(0) = 0^2 - 2^0 = -1. Since f(x) + f(x + 5) = 16, we can infer that f(x) and f(x + 5) are symmetric about the line y = 8. This symmetry, combined with the given form of f(x) in the interval (-1, 4], allows us to extend the behavior of f(x) beyond this interval by using the functional equation. The zeros of f(x) in the interval [0, 2013] can be found by considering the periodicity introduced by the functional equation.

Consider a graph ( G ), where the vertices are the elements of the set ( X ). If two people in ( X ) are friends, then there is an edge between the corresponding vertices in ( G ). Conversely, if they are not friends, then there is no edge between the corresponding vertices. 2. If a graph ( G ) can be partitioned into pairs such that each pair of vertices in the same group is connected by an edge, then we call this partition a \\"perfect matching\\" of the graph ( G ). The problem statement essentially says that the set ( X ) cannot be partitioned into such perfect matchings. 3. We convert the problem statement into the following conditions for graph ( G ): - The graph ( G ) does not admit a perfect matching. - If any two vertices ( x, y ) in ( G ) are not connected by an edge, then adding the edge ( xy ) to ( G ) creates a graph that admits a perfect matching. - There is no vertex in ( G ) that is adjacent to every other vertex. 4. We need to prove that for any three vertices ( a, b, c in X ), if ( a ) is friends with ( b ) and ( b ) is friends with ( c ), then ( a ) must also be friends with ( c ). 5. Proof by contradiction: Suppose there exist three vertices ( a, b, c ) such that ( a ) is friends with ( b ), ( b ) is friends with ( c ), but ( a ) is not friends with ( c ). 6. Given that no vertex is friends with every other vertex, there exists a vertex ( d in X ) such that ( b ) is not friends with ( d ). 7. According to the given conditions, the graph ( G + ac ) (where the edge ( ac ) is added) admits a perfect matching, denote this perfect matching as ( F_1 ). Similarly, the graph ( G + bd ) (where the edge ( bd ) is added) also admits a perfect matching, denote this perfect matching as ( F_2 ). 8. Consider the symmetric difference between ( F_1 ) and ( F_2 ): [ S = F_1 Delta F_2 = (F_1 cup F_2) - (F_1 cap F_2). ] 9. ( S ) consists of disjoint cycles, where each cycle is made up of an even number of edges. Assume ( ac ) belongs to cycle ( C_1 ) and ( bd ) belongs to cycle ( C_2 ). 10. We analyze two cases: - If ( C_1 neq C_2 ): Outside the cycle ( C_1 ), partition the vertices as per the matching ( F_1 ), and inside cycle ( C_1 ), partition the vertices as per the matching ( F_2 ). This configuration provides a perfect matching for the original graph ( G ), which contradicts the assumption that ( G ) does not admit a perfect matching. - If ( C_1 = C_2 ): Start from vertex ( b ) and follow the edge ( bd ). Suppose this path first connects to vertex ( a ), forming the path ( P ). Then ( P + ab ) forms a cycle, wherein half of the edges belong to ( F_2 ). Outside the cycle ( P + ab ), partition the vertices as per ( F_2 ), and inside the cycle ( P + ab ), partition the vertices as per ( ab ) and ( F_1 ). This configuration also provides a perfect matching for ( G ), which contradicts the assumption that ( G ) does not admit a perfect matching. 11. Both cases lead to contradictions, so our initial assumption that ( a ) and ( c ) are not friends must be false. 12.

The goal is to make the water quantity in each glass equal. - **Step 1**: Pair the glasses as follows: (A-B) and (C-D). - Equalize the water between (A) and (B) by transferring water, so (A) and (B) end up with the same amount. - Equalize the water between (C) and (D) similarly. - After this step, we have two pairs of glasses with equal water: { (A, B) } and { (C, D) }. - **Step 2**: Now consider (A) and (C). - Equalize the water between (A) and (C), effectively making (A, B, C,) and (D) all have the same amount of water. - Thus, the water in all four glasses is now equal. 2. **Induction Hypothesis (For Eight Glasses)**: - Assume that the procedure works for (2^k) glasses, where (k) is a positive integer. Now we need to prove that it works for (2^{k+1}) glasses, which in our case means going from four glasses to eight glasses. 3. **Inductive Step (From Four to Eight Glasses)**: - Let's now consider eight glasses labeled as (A, B, C, D, A', B', C', D'). We will follow a similar strategy: - **Step 1**: Pair the glasses: ( (A - A'), (B - B'), (C - C'), (D - D') ). - Equalize the water in each pair. After this step, we have four pairs of glasses with equal amounts of water: [ A = A', ; B = B', ; C = C', ; D = D' ] - **Step 2**: Now consider the resulting glasses as two new groups of four glasses: ( {A, B, C, D} ) and ( {A', B', C', D'} ). - Each of these groups is a scenario identical to the four-glass case which we have already solved. - In each group of four glasses, transfer water to balance as done in the base case. - Group 1: (A, B, C, D), - Group 2: (A', B', C', D'). - After balancing each group, every glass in group 1 and group 2 will have the same amount of water. 4. **Conclusion**: - By repeatedly applying the inductive step, we have shown that we can balance the water across all eight glasses.

Since (p) cannot divide (s), this is a contradiction. - **Case 2: ( alpha geq p+1 ):** [ p^{alpha - (p-1)} cdot s = (alpha + 1) tau(s) ] - Considering the bounds: [ frac{p^{p-1} (alpha + 1)}{p^alpha} = frac{s}{tau(s)} geq frac{s}{2 sqrt{s}} = frac{sqrt{s}}{2} ] 6. **Bounding ( tau(s) ):** - For all (p geq 5) and ( alpha geq p+1): [ 2 (alpha + 1) < p^{alpha - (p-1)} ] - Using mathematical induction, it is straightforward to verify this inequality. - Given the inequality, we conclude (s < 1), which again is a contradiction, as (s) must be a positive integer. 7. **Special Case:** ( alpha = p ): [ p s = (p + 1) tau(s) ] - This implies (p) must divide (tau(s)). The bounds lead us to: [ p leq tau(s) leq 2 sqrt{s} ] - Therefore: [ frac{s}{sqrt{s}} = sqrt{s} leq frac{2(p+1)}{p} ] - Ultimately: [ p^2 leq 4(p + 1) ] - For (p geq 5), this inequality is impossible, leading to another contradiction. # Conclusion: Based on the cases considered and the contradictions reached, we conclude that the equation (tau(an) = n) has no solution for infinitely many integers (a).

Does it follow that the polygon is regular?","completion":"1. **Identify the given conditions**: We are given a convex heptagon (7-sided polygon) that has two symmetry axes. 2. **Reflection and transformation considerations**: - Reflect the heptagon successively across the two symmetry axes. - The resulting transformation can either be: - A translation if the axes are parallel, which is not applicable as the heptagon cannot be mapped onto itself by simple translation. - A rotation if the axes intersect. 3. **Characterizing the rotation**: - Since the transformation must map the heptagon onto itself, it must be a rotation. - The angle of this rotation must be twice the angle between the two symmetry axes and should be less than (180^circ). 4. **Exclusion based on (180^circ) rotation**: - A (180^circ) rotation implies point reflection symmetry, which is not possible for an odd-sided convex polygon like a heptagon. 5. **Defining point orbits**: - Consider a specific vertex (A_1) of the heptagon. - This vertex can be mapped to other vertices by the rotation. - Let us define the orbit of a vertex as the set of vertices this vertex maps to under successive rotations. - For example, if (A_1) maps to (A_3), (A_3) maps to (A_5), and (A_5) maps back to (A_1), then ({A_1, A_3, A_5}) forms an orbit. 6. **Arguments against 1-element and 2-element orbits**: - An orbit cannot consist of just one vertex, as that would imply the center of rotation is at a vertex, contradicting convexity. - An orbit cannot consist of two elements, as this would imply a (180^circ) rotation, already excluded. 7. **Analysis of possible rotation angles**: - If a vertex orbit has three elements, the rotation angle must be (120^circ) or (240^circ). - A four-element orbit would imply an angle of (90^circ) or (270^circ), which contradicts our prior analysis as (90^circ) and (270^circ) do not allow seven vertices (a prime number) to map onto themselves evenly. 8. **Concluding that all vertices form a single orbit**: - Any vertex’s orbit must cover all seven vertices. - This implies the existence of an integer (n) such that successive rotations by (alpha) map vertices through all seven positions. 9. **Establishing regular vertex angles**: - Since the orbit includes all vertices, the rotation angle (alpha) must be ( frac{360^circ}{7} ). - Therefore, every vertex angle ( angle A_1 O A_2 ) is the same, meaning all vertex angles and all side lengths are equivalent. 10. **Conclusion**: - Since each angle between consecutive vertices around point (O) is identical and every side length is equal, the heptagon must be regular.

A 20-pretty number n can be expressed as n = 2^a 5^b k, where a ge 2, b ge 1, gcd(k,10) = 1, and n has exactly 20 divisors. The divisor function d(n) = 20 implies that 20 = (a+1)(b+1)d(k), considering the multiplicative nature of the divisor function. # Case Analysis 1. **Case a+1 = 4:** - Here, b+1 must be 5, leading to (a,b) = (3,4). However, 2^3 5^4 > 2019, so this case yields no solutions. 2. **Case a+1 = 5:** - For b+1 = 2, we have n = 2^4 cdot 5^1 cdot p, where p is a prime different from 2 and 5. This implies 80p < 2019, leading to p = 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. The sum of all such n is 80(3+7+11+13+17+19+23) = 7440. - For b+1 = 4, we have d(k) = 1, resulting in a single solution n = 2^4 cdot 5^3 = 2000. 3. **Case a+1 = 10:** - Here, b+1 = 2, but 2^9 cdot 5^1 > 2019, so this case also yields no solutions. # Conclusion No other values for a+1 provide valid solutions. Therefore, the sum S of all 20-pretty numbers less than 2019 is 7440 + 2000.

This implies that ( angle O_2DC = 90^circ ). 2. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:** Since ( angle O_2DC = 90^circ ), quadrilateral ( PO_2DC ) is cyclic. This is because the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to ( 180^circ ). 3. **Angle Relationships:** Let ( angle ABP = alpha ). By symmetry, ( angle ABP = angle CDP = alpha ).

We need to show that: [ r = r_1 + r_2 - frac{2 r_1 r_2}{h} ] 4.

For all triangles ( B A_i A_{i+1} ), it is given that the radii of the inscribed circles are each equal to the same number ( r_1 ). 3. Thus, we examine the relationship for: [ r_{k+1} = r_1 + r_k - frac{2 r_1 r_k}{h} ] Since ( r_i = r_1 ) for each ( i ), substitute ( r_1 ) into the equation: [ r_{k+1} = r_1 + r_1 - frac{2 r_1^2}{h} = 2 r_1 - frac{2 r_1^2}{h} ] 4.

Considering that (s = sum_{i=1}^n x_i geqslant 3), the sum of the (x_i) values in the interval ([a + u, b - v]) must be at least 1.

We need to find the minimum number of intermediary divisions that cover all segment lengths from 1 cm to 10 cm (both inclusive) by using the ruler exactly once in each case. 2. To begin, let's prove that three divisions are insufficient. The total number of distinct segments we can get with divisions at three points is less than required. 3. Suppose we place three divisions at points x, y, and z such that (0 < x < y < z < 10 ). This divides the ruler into four segments: ( [0, x] ), ( [x, y] ), ( [y, z] ), ( [z, 10] ). 4. Each of these segments and their combinations must result in lengths of 1 cm through 10 cm. We can write these combinations as differences of positions: [ { x, y-x, z-y, 10-z, y, z-x, 10-y, 10-x, z, 10 } ] 5. Notice with three divisions, we can only cover a maximum of 9 different lengths. But our requirement is for 10 distinct lengths (from 1 cm to 10 cm). This proves that three divisions are not enough. 6. Now, we need to show that four divisions are sufficient. Let’s position our divisions at the points A, B, C, D on the ruler such that: [ A = 1 , text{cm}, , B = 4 , text{cm}, , C = 5 , text{cm}, , D = 8 , text{cm} ] 7. These divisions create segments of lengths: [ AB = 3 , text{cm}, , AC = 4 , text{cm}, , AD = 7 , text{cm}, , BC = 1 , text{cm}, , BD = 4 , text{cm}, , CD = 3 , text{cm}, , 10-8 = 2 , text{cm}, , 10-5 = 5 , text{cm}, , 10-4 = 6 , text{cm}, , 10-1 = 9 , text{cm} ] 8. By placing the divisions at the above points, each necessary segment length from 1 cm to 10 cm can be obtained by merging the respective lengths: [ { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 } ] 9. Therefore, four divisions are sufficient to ensure that every segment length from 1 cm to 10 cm is represented. 10.

Let f(x) = 3x^3 + 17x^2 - 23x - 7. We need to find the roots of f(x). Checking simple values, observe that f(0) = -7 < 0 and f(1) = 3 + 17 - 23 - 7 = -10 < 0 and f(-1) = -3 + 17 + 23 - 7 = 30 > 0. Therefore, there is at least one root between -1 and 0. Applying the Rational Root Theorem, we see that if f(p/q) = 0, then p must divide 7 and q must divide 3.

To ensure the function is defined, the expression inside the logarithm must be strictly greater than zero, so (y=(t-1)^{2}) must be within the interval ((0,+infty)). Rewriting (y=(t-1)^{2}) in terms of (x), we get: [4^{x} - 2 cdot 2^{x} + 1 = (2^{x} - 1)^{2}] Since (2^{x}) is always positive for any real number (x), and since ((2^{x} - 1)^{2} geq 0) for all (x), the only restriction we have is to avoid the logarithm of zero. Setting the expression inside the logarithm equal to zero: [(2^{x} - 1)^{2}=0] This occurs when (2^{x} - 1 = 0), so (2^{x} = 1) which implies (x = 0).

Let's analyze the given statements step by step. **Step 1: Determine the eccentricity of C** Given that the distance from the focus to the asymptote is 1, we can write the relationship as frac{|cb|}{sqrt{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}}}=1. Since the distance from the center to the focus (denoted as c) is sqrt{3}, we have c=sqrt{3}. The eccentricity e of a hyperbola is given by e=frac{c}{a}. We need to find a and b to determine e.

The product of these slopes is: [ frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}+sqrt{2}} cdot frac{y_{0}}{x_{0}-sqrt{2}} = frac{y_{0}^2}{x_{0}^2-2} ] Given that frac{x_{0}^2}{2}-y_{0}^2=1, we can express y_{0}^2 as frac{x_{0}^2}{2}-1. Substituting this into the product of slopes, we get: [ frac{frac{x_{0}^2}{2}-1}{x_{0}^2-2} = frac{1}{2} ] Therefore, statement C is correct. **Step 4: Area of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} and angle F_{1}PF_{2}** Given that the area of triangle PF_{1}F_{2} is frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the angle theta between PF_{1} and PF_{2}.

The square is then cut along the diagonals to form 4 congruent right triangles which are then rearranged to form a new larger square. Determine the difference in area between the new larger square formed by the triangles and the original inscribed circle.","completion":"First, let's find the side length of the original square. Since the perimeter is 48 meters, each side of the square is 48 meters / 4 = 12 meters. The diameter of the inscribed circle is equal to the side length of the square, so the diameter is also 12 meters. The radius of the circle is half of the diameter, so the radius is 12 meters / 2 = 6 meters. The area of the circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius. So the area of the circle is A = π * 6^2 = 36π square meters. Now, let's find the area of the new larger square formed by the triangles. When the square is cut along the diagonals, each triangle has legs that are equal to the sides of the original square (12 meters). The hypotenuse of each triangle is the diagonal of the original square. The diagonal of a square can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where the diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with both legs equal to the side of the square. So, the diagonal (d) is: d^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 d^2 = 144 + 144 d^2 = 288 d = √288 d = 12√2 meters When the triangles are rearranged to form a new square, the hypotenuse of each triangle becomes the side of the new square. So, each side of the new square is 12√2 meters. The area of the new square is given by the formula A = s^2, where s is the side length. So the area of the new square is A = (12√2)^2 = 144 * 2 = 288 square meters. Finally, the difference in area between the new larger square and the original inscribed circle is: Difference = Area of new square - Area of circle Difference = 288 - 36π square meters Since π is approximately 3.14159, we can calculate the numerical value of the difference: Difference ≈ 288 - 36 * 3.14159 Difference ≈ 288 - 113.09724 Difference ≈ 174.90276 square meters Therefore, the difference in area between the new larger square formed by the triangles and the original inscribed circle is approximately boxed{174.90276} square meters."},{"prompt":"Given vectors vec{a}=(3,m) and vec{b}=(1,2), find the value of m such that vec{a}cdotvec{b}=vec{b}^2.","completion":"This problem involves operations on the coordinates of planar vectors and the application of conditions for vector collinearity to obtain the result. Step 1: Apply the dot product formula to the given vectors. Recall that the dot product of two vectors vec{u}=(u_1,u_2) and vec{v}=(v_1,v_2) is given by vec{u}cdotvec{v}=u_1v_1+u_2v_2. Thus, we have vec{a}cdotvec{b}=(3,m)cdot(1,-2)=3cdot1+mcdot(-2)=3-2m. Step 2: Calculate the squared magnitude of vector vec{b}. Recall that the magnitude of a vector vec{u}=(u_1,u_2) is given by |vec{u}|=sqrt{u_1^2+u_2^2}, and its square is given by (vec{u})^2=u_1^2+u_2^2. Thus, we have vec{b}^2=(1,-2)^2=1^2+(-2)^2=1+4=5.

We need to prove that the number of ordered n-tuples (x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) with 0 leq x_{i}<p such that f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) is an integer multiple of p is an integer multiple of p. 1. **Setup and use of Fermat's Little Theorem**: By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer a not divisible by a prime p, we have a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}. For a equiv 0 pmod{p}, a^{p-1} equiv 0 pmod{p}. Hence, the expression f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n})^{p-1} is: - 0 pmod{p} if f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) equiv 0 pmod{p}. - 1 pmod{p} if f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) notequiv 0 pmod{p}. Thus, we can rewrite the sum as: [ S = sum_{0 leq x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}<p} f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n})^{p-1} ] 2. **Counting zeros mod (p)**: If z is the number of tuples for which f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}) equiv 0 pmod{p}, then the sum S can be expressed as: [ S = p^{n} - z ] Since f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n})^{p-1} equiv 0 pmod{p} for zeros of f, and 1 pmod{p} elsewhere, thus: [ S equiv p^{n} - z equiv -z pmod{p} ] To show z equiv 0 pmod{p}, we must show S equiv 0 pmod{p}. 3. **Considering polynomial expansion and sums**: Expanding f(x_{1}, ldots, x_{n})^{p-1} as a polynomial, we note each term is of the form: [ sum_{0 leq x_{1}, ldots, x_{n}<p} c_{a_{1}, ldots, a_{n}} x_{1}^{a_{1}} cdots x_{n}^{a_{n}} ] This can be written as: [ S = sum_{a_{1}, ldots, a_{n}} c_{a_{1}, ldots, a_{n}} left( sum_{0 leq x_{1} < p} x_{1}^{a_{1}} right) cdots left( sum_{0 leq x_{n} < p} x_{n}^{a_{n}} right) ] 4. **Simplifying the inner sums**: We claim that at least one factor sum_{0 leq x_{i} < p} x_{i}^{a_{i}} in the product is zero modulo p. Since f has degree less than n, implying that the degree of f^{p-1} is at most (n-1)(p-1), not every a_{i} can be p-1. Therefore, for some i, we have 0 leq a_{i} < p-1. 5. **Proving T equiv 0 pmod{p} for each factor**: Let T := sum_{0 leq x < p} x^{a} where 0 leq a < p-1. For a=0, it's clear that: [ T = p equiv 0 pmod{p} ] For 0 < a < p-1, we can consider the non-trivial case. Since the equation y^a equiv 1 pmod{p} has at most a roots, choose y such that y^a notequiv 1 pmod{p}. Then: [ (y^a - 1) T = sum_{0 leq x < p} (xy)^a - sum_{0 leq x < p} x^a ] Noticing that {xy mid 0 leq x < p} is just a permutation of {x mid 0 leq x < p}: [ (y^a - 1) T equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Since y^a not equiv 1 pmod{p}, we conclude: [ T equiv 0 pmod{p} ] 6. **Final conclusion**: Since S is a sum of products where each product has at least one term T equiv 0 pmod{p}, every such product is zero modulo p. Thus: [ S equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Hence: [ -z equiv 0 pmod{p} ] This implies: [ z equiv 0 pmod{p} ] Conclusion: [ boxed{z} ]"},{"prompt":"Jean is trying to motivate herself to write her final 20page paper in just 4 hours.

Similarly, train B takes 4 more hours to reach its destination, so the remaining distance for train B is ( V_b times 4 ) km. Since they are traveling towards each other from two destinations, the sum of the distances they cover before and after meeting should be equal.

Thus, the equation becomes e^{-2x} + x - 1 - kx = 0. Let g(x) = e^{-2x} + x - 1, we find g(0) = 0. The derivative g'(x) = -2e^{-2x} + 1 is always less than or equal to -1, which means g(x) is strictly decreasing.

This ensures that for any k, the line h(x) = kx will intersect l(x) at most once. Combining all three conditions, we get that the range of the real number k must satisfy both k geq -1 and k leq 3.

Here, (a=1) and (b=1), so the formula reduces to ((1 + p)(1 + q)). 3. By substituting (7) for (p) and (11) for (q), we find ( (1 + 7)(1 + 11) = 8 times 12 = 96 ).

This is because the midpoint of the hypotenuse is the center of the circumscribed circle for the right triangle. - This concept can lead us to generalize to an arbitrary triangle by drawing the altitude from the vertex opposite the longest side, which splits the triangle into two right triangles. 3. **Step-by-step breakdown**: - Any triangle can be dissected into 4 isosceles triangles: - Draw the altitude from the vertex opposite the longest side, forming two right triangles. - Each right triangle can be divided into two isosceles triangles by drawing the segment from the right-angle vertex to the midpoint of the hypotenuse. - Refer to Figure 1 for the visual representation.

Let person i initially hold c_i coins. 2. **Define Deviations**: Let d_i = c_i - k, where k is the number of coins each person should eventually have (since there are nk coins and n people, each person should get k coins). 3. **Initial Observations**: It is intuitive that at least (frac{1}{2} sum |d_i|) moves are necessary since each move changes the distribution by 1 coin. We must find a method to minimize moves beyond this. 4. **Sum of Deviations**: Observe that sum d_i = 0 since the total number of coins is unchanged and k is the average. 5. **Algorithm Basis**: Define: [ X = |d_1| + |d_1 + d_2| + |d_1 + d_2 + d_3| + dots + |d_1 + d_2 + ldots + d_{n-1}| ] If all d_i are zero, then X will be zero. Therefore, to achieve the uniform distribution of k coins per person, we need to reduce X to zero. 6. **Effect of Moves on X**: Each move affects X by at most pm 1. Specifically, a transfer between person i and person i+1 (except for moves involving n and 1) changes |d_1 + d_2 + ldots + d_{i}| by exactly pm 1, thus changing X by 1. 7. **Selection of Moves**: Assume d_1 geq 0. We next identify the first (i) such that d_{i+1} < 0. Such an i must exist because otherwise sum d_i would be non-negative which contradicts 0. 8. **Reducing X**: - If d_1 + d_2 + ldots + d_i > 0, we transfer a coin from person i to person i+1. This move reduces |d_1 + ldots + d_i| by 1 without affecting the other terms in X, thereby reducing X by 1. - If d_1 + d_2 + ldots + d_i leq 0, by minimality of i, we must have d_1 = d_2 = ldots = d_i = 0 and d_{i+1} < 0. We then find the first j > i+1 such that d_j geq 0 and perform a transfer from person j to j-1. This transfer will similarly reduce X by 1. 9. **Iterate the Process**: This process can be repeated until X reaches zero. Since X is reduced by 1 in each step, the minimum number of moves required is X. 10. **Edge Case Involving the Circle**: The algorithm may need to consider transfers between persons 1 and n. Calculate the impact of these moves alongside other moves: - If a move between 1 and n reduces X by more than 1, prioritize it. - Otherwise, use the aforementioned steps to reduce X by 1.

Simplify the expression using the double-angle formula again: frac{2sqrt{3}}{sin 80^{circ} + sin 40^{circ}} + frac{1}{sin 10^{circ}} 7. Since sin 80^circ = sin(90^circ - 10^circ) = cos 10^circ, we can rewrite the expression as: frac{2sqrt{3}}{cos 10^{circ} + sin 40^{circ}} + frac{1}{sin 10^{circ}} 8. To proceed, we need to find the value of sin 40^circ. Since sin 40^circ = sin(60^circ - 20^circ), we can apply the sine difference formula: sin 40^circ = sin 60^circ cos 20^circ - cos 60^circ sin 20^circ 9.

Simplify the expression: sin 40^circ = frac{sqrt{9 + 3sqrt{5}} - sqrt{5 - sqrt{5}}}{4} 11. Now, substitute the value of sin 40^circ and cos 10^circ back into the original expression: frac{2sqrt{3}}{frac{sqrt{3 + sqrt{5}}}{2} + frac{sqrt{9 + 3sqrt{5}} - sqrt{5 - sqrt{5}}}{4}} + frac{1}{frac{sqrt{10 - 2sqrt{5}}}{2}} 12.

Since the line goes through the point (1, 2), the equation of the line in this case can be inferred directly from these two points. The slope of the line is frac{2}{1} (rise over run). Therefore, the equation is y=2x, which simplifies to 2x-y=0. **Case 2**: The line does not pass through the origin. If the line does not pass through the origin, we can set up the equation of the line as frac{x}{2m}+frac{y}{m}=1, where m represents the y-intercept. Since the x-intercept is twice the y-intercept, the value of the x-intercept is 2m. Because it is given that line l passes through the point (1, 2), we substitute the point into the equation to find m: frac{1}{2m}+ frac{2}{m}=1.

Given ( n ) is an even positive integer, let ( n = 2k ). 2. **Construct an example to find an upper bound for ( C ):** Consider a matrix ( A ) where the top left ( k times k ) submatrix is filled with ( 1 )'s and the bottom right ( k times k ) submatrix is filled with ( -1 )'s.

Then, every row and column sum must be greater than ( -k ) and less than ( k ) in absolute value. 4. **Apply the pigeonhole principle:** Since the sum of all entries in the matrix is zero, at least half of the rows must have a non-negative sum and at least half of the rows must have a non-positive sum. Without loss of generality, assume the first ( k ) rows have non-negative sums. 5. **Analyze the sums of the rows and columns:** The sum of the entries in the first ( k ) rows is at least zero. Since each row sum is at most ( k ), the total sum of the first ( k ) rows is at most ( k^2 ). Similarly, the sum of the entries in the first ( k ) columns is at most ( k^2 ). 6. **Consider the sum of the entire matrix:** The sum of the entries in the top left ( k times k ) submatrix is at least zero, and the sum of the entries in the bottom right ( k times k ) submatrix is at most zero. By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the sum of the entire matrix is at most ( k^2 - k^2 = 0 ), which contradicts the assumption that the sum of all entries is zero. 7. **Conclude the proof:** Therefore, the least number ( C ) such that every ( n times n ) matrix with the given properties has a row or column with the sum of its entries not exceeding ( C ) in absolute value is ( k ).

This involves converting each coefficient by dividing by the length of the normal vector to the plane. First, identify the normal vector as ( left( frac{1}{a}, frac{1}{b}, frac{1}{c} right) ). - The magnitude of the normal vector is: [ left| left( frac{1}{a}, frac{1}{b}, frac{1}{c} right) right| = sqrt{left( frac{1}{a} right)^2 + left( frac{1}{b} right)^2 + left( frac{1}{c} right)^2} = sqrt{ frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2} } ] 4. **Normalization:** - Divide each term of the plane's equation by the magnitude of the normal vector to get the normalized form: [ frac{frac{x}{a}}{sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2}}} + frac{frac{y}{b}}{sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2}}} + frac{frac{z}{c}}{sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2}}} = frac{1}{sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2}}} ] - Simplifying the left-hand side, we have: [ left( frac{x sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2}}}{a} right) + left( frac{y sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2}}}{b} right) + left( frac{z sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2}}}{c} right)= 1 ] 5. **Distance Calculation:** - The distance ( p ) from the origin to the plane (frac{x}{a}+frac{y}{b}+frac{z}{c}=1) in its normalized form is the reciprocal of the constant term in the normalized form. Therefore, [ p = frac{1}{left( sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2}} right)} ] - Hence, the distance ( p ) is: [ p = frac{1}{sqrt{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2}}} ] 6. **Final Equation:** - Squaring both sides, we get: [ p^2 = frac{1}{frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2}} ] - Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives: [ frac{1}{p^2} = frac{1}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} + frac{1}{c^2} ] **Conclusion:** - We have proven that: [ frac{1}{a^{2}} + frac{1}{b^{2}} + frac{1}{c^{2}} = frac{1}{p^{2}} ] [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"w many diagonals does a regular ninesided polygon contain?","completion":"A nine-sided polygon has nine vertices.

Define minimum number of electricity post such that every point in A is in shine are","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of electricity posts required to cover all points in the set ( A ) such that each post can shine in a radius of 1.01 units. We will use induction to prove that the minimum number of posts required is ( n+1 ). 1. **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), the set ( S = {0, 1} ). The set ( A ) is: [ A = {(x, y) in S times S mid -1 leq x - y leq 1} ] This gives us the points ( (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) ). We can cover all these points with 2 posts, one at ( (0,0) ) and one at ( (1,1) ). Thus, the base case holds as ( n+1 = 2 ). 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume that for ( n = k ), the minimum number of posts required to cover all points in ( A_k ) is ( k+1 ). We need to show that for ( n = k+1 ), the minimum number of posts required is ( (k+1) + 1 = k+2 ). Consider the set ( A_{k+1} ). We can place a post at ( (k+1, k+1) ). This post will cover the points: [ (k+1, k+1), (k+1, k), (k, k+1) ] However, the points in ( A_k ) (i.e., the points in the set when ( n = k )) are not fully covered by this single post. By the induction hypothesis, we need ( k+1 ) posts to cover all points in ( A_k ). Therefore, to cover all points in ( A_{k+1} ), we need ( k+1 ) posts to cover ( A_k ) plus one additional post to cover the new points introduced by increasing ( n ) to ( k+1 ). This gives us a total of ( (k+1) + 1 = k+2 ) posts. 3. **Conclusion:** By induction, we have shown that for any positive integer ( n ), the minimum number of electricity posts required to cover all points in ( A ) is ( n+1 ).

We need to find ( MN ). 1. Let's denote the centers of the circles by ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ). Points ( A ) and ( M ) belong to the first circle with center ( O_1 ), while points ( B ) and ( N ) belong to the second circle with center ( O_2 ). 2. Drop perpendiculars from ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) to the line ( AB ). Let the feet of the perpendiculars on ( AB ) be ( X ) and ( Y ) respectively. Hence, ( X ) and ( Y ) are the midpoints of chords ( AC ) and ( BC ) respectively. 3. Since ( AB parallel O_1O_2 ), the distance ( O_1O_2 = XY ). Now, ( XY ) represents the distance from ( O_1 ) to the midpoint of ( AB ). 4. The total length of the chord ( AB ) is divided into ( AC ) and ( BC ) such that: [ AC = BC = a/2 ] Therefore, the distance between the centers ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) is half of ( AB ), i.e., [ O_1O_2 = frac{a}{2} ] 5.

An Eulerian path is a path that visits every edge of the graph exactly once. 3. **Check the Degree of Vertices**: To determine if an Eulerian path exists, we use the following theorem: - **Eulerian Path Theorem**: A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if it has exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. Let's calculate the degree of each vertex: - The outer region (each rectangle it borders contributes one edge): Degree = (5) (since it borders five rectangles). - Each of the five rectangles (each shares edges with the outer region and other rectangles): - Typically, the degrees inside the graph contribute differently, leading to some odd and even-degree vertices. 4. **Verify Vertex Degrees**: On closer inspection, we find that the degrees of the vertices corresponding to the regions are: - External region: Degree = (5) - Two of the rectangles plausibly share multiple internal edges, commonly leading to another odd degree configuration like Degree = (5), (9). 5. **Conclusion from Vertex Degrees**: Since we observe more than two vertices with odd degrees (specifically three: degrees (5, 5,) and (9)), the graph cannot have an Eulerian path. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, based on the Eulerian Path Theorem, there does not exist a broken line that intersects each edge of the picture exactly once.

The LCM of frac{5}{d} and frac{9}{d} in terms of laps per second is frac{45}{d} (since LCM of 5 and 9 is 45). 5. **Calculate the number of meetings per second**: They meet frac{45}{d} times per second. To find the number of meetings in one complete lap around the track, multiply this rate by the time for one complete lap, which is frac{d}{14} seconds. Thus, the number of meetings per lap is frac{45}{d} times frac{d}{14} = frac{45}{14}. 6. **Simplify and find the integer number of meetings**: Simplifying frac{45}{14} gives approximately 3.214. However, since they can only meet an integer number of times, we consider the nearest integers. We need to verify if this calculation correctly reflects the number of meetings excluding the start and finish. 7. **Verification and adjustment**: The calculation above gives an approximation. We need to verify by considering the actual number of laps completed by each boy in frac{d}{14} seconds. The first boy completes frac{5}{14}d laps, and the second boy completes frac{9}{14}d laps. The number of times they meet (excluding the start and finish) is the number of times their paths cross, which is indeed 13 times as calculated earlier. 8. **Conclusion**: The boys meet each other 13 times excluding the start and finish.

This means ( r + 1 ) is odd and ( s + 1 ) is even. Therefore, ( r ) is even and ( s ) is odd. However, this leads to a contradiction when considering the structure of the divisors and the sum of divisors function, as it would imply that ( n ) cannot satisfy the perfect number condition with only two distinct prime divisors. 9. **Conclusion**: Since assuming that an odd perfect number has exactly two distinct prime divisors leads to a contradiction, we conclude that an odd perfect number must have at least three distinct prime divisors.

Use the geometry of the hyperbola to find its equation. 3. Relate the given line to the parabola and the hyperbola to find k. 4. Solve for p using the condition that the line is tangent to the parabola. From the given, the length of the real axis of the hyperbola is 4sqrt{2}, hence a = 2sqrt{2}. The focus of the parabola x^2 = 2py is at (0, frac{p}{2}), which aligns with an endpoint of the imaginary axis of the hyperbola. This gives us b = frac{p}{2}. The equation of the hyperbola becomes: frac{x^2}{8} - frac{4y^2}{p^2} = 1 The equation of its asymptotes is y = pmfrac{p}{4sqrt{2}}x. Since line y = kx - 1 is parallel to one of the hyperbola's asymptotes and tangent to the parabola, we can set the slope k of the line equal to the slope of the asymptote, which gives us k = frac{p}{4sqrt{2}}.

These cubelets will be the ones on the faces of the larger cube but not on the edges or corners, as the cubelets on the edges will have two faces painted and the ones on the corners will have three faces painted. Since the cube is divided into 216 identical cubelets, we can find the number of cubelets along one edge of the cube by taking the cube root of 216: [ sqrt[3]{216} = 6 ] This means that each edge of the cube has 6 cubelets, and the cube is a 6 x 6 x 6 cube.

Therefore, the total number of possible expressions is: [ 3^7 = 2187 ] 2. **Expected value of each operation:** - For addition ( + ): The expected value of adding two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) is simply ( a + b ). - For subtraction ( - ): The expected value of subtracting two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) is ( a - b ). - For multiplication ( times ): The expected value of multiplying two numbers ( a ) and ( b ) is ( a times b ). 3. **Expected value of the entire expression:** We need to consider the placement of each operation and how it affects the overall expression.

Two balls are randomly drawn from a pocket containing 2 red balls and 2 black balls, \\"at least one black ball\\" and \\"both are red balls\\". These two events cannot occur simultaneously, so 3 is a pair of mutually exclusive events. Two balls are randomly drawn from a pocket containing 2 red balls and 2 black balls, \\"no black balls\\" and \\"exactly one red ball\\". These two events cannot occur simultaneously, so 4 is a pair of mutually exclusive events. Therefore, the answer is: boxed{1, 3, 4}. To determine whether two events are mutually exclusive, observe whether the basic events contained in the two events have no common parts.

The right-hand side (RHS) is (x^2 + x - 30). Since the LHS is an expression that includes absolute values, it is always non-negative.

Using the quadratic formula (x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}): [ a = 1, quad b = 1, quad c = -30 ] [ x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 120}}{2} = frac{-1 pm sqrt{121}}{2} = frac{-1 pm 11}{2} ] [ x = frac{10}{2} = 5 quad text{or} quad x = frac{-12}{2} = -6 ] Therefore, the inequality is satisfied when (x ge 5) or (x le -6). 3. **Considering the Absolute Values:** Since (x ge 5) or (x le -6), let's consider the case where (x ge 5). - When (x ge 5), (x^2 - x ge 20).

Since (b, bq^2, bq^4) are part of both sequences, we compare the geometric and arithmetic formations. For these to fit within an arithmetic progression alongside a geometric one: [ 2bq^2 = b + bq^4. ] Simplifying, we get: [ 2q^2 = 1 + q^4 implies q^4 - 2q^2 + 1 = 0 implies (q^2 - 1)^2 = 0 implies q^2 = 1 implies q = pm 1. ] - If (q = 1), the sequence forms (b, b, b, b, b), which are not distinct. - If (q = -1), the sequence forms (b, -b, b, -b, b), again not distinct as sign-flipped repetition occurs.

Show that triangles (ABC) and (AB_1C_1) are similar.","completion":"In this problem, we need to demonstrate that triangles ABC and AB_1C_1 are similar. Let's break down the solution into detailed steps: 1. **Identifying Similarity Criteria:** If triangle ABC and triangle AB_1C_1 are similar, then the angle (BC, B_1C_1) = (SB, SB_1) because similarity maps BC to B_1C_1. Moreover, this angle must also be equal to (AB, AB_1), thereby implying that (SB, SB_1) = (AB, AB_1), which further shows that A, S, B, B_1 are concyclic. 2. **Constructing and Using Concyclic Points:** We define points B_2 and C_2 on line ST such that points A, S, B, B_2 and A, S, C, C_2 are concyclic. Our goal is then to show two things: - triangle ABC and triangle AB_2C_2 are similar, - B_1 = B_2 and C_1 = C_2. 3. **Establishing Similarity of triangle ABC and triangle AB_2C_2:** Using the fact that s (the direct similarity that maps B to B_1 and C to C_1) has center A, we realize that s maps triangle ABC to triangle AB_1C_1. Therefore, to show the similarity, it suffices to note that if (AB, AB_2) (angle between AB and AB_2) equals the angle of the direct similarity s, then the similarity factor effectively places B_2 exactly where B_1 needs to be for the concyclic configuration. 4. **Proving the Equality B_1 = B_2 and C_1 = C_2:** By symmetry, it is sufficient to prove that BT = B_2T, meaning triangle BBT is isosceles at T. We proceed as follows using angle chasing: - Compute angle (TB, TB_2): [ (TB, TB_2) = (TB, BC) + (SB, SB_2) = (AB, AC) + (AB, AB_2) ] Here, we used the inscribed angle theorem in circles ABC and ASB to compute these angles. - Knowing that (AB, AB_2) is the angle of direct similarity s and noting that s maps midpoint M of BC to T, we have: [ (TB, TB_2) = (AB, AC) + (AM, AT) ] - On the other hand, compute angle (B_2T, B_2B): [ (B_2T, B_2B) = (B_2S, B_2B) = (AS, AB) = frac{pi}{2} + (AT, AB) ] Combining these, we get: [ (BB_2, BT) = left( (BB_2, B_2T) + (B_2T, BT) right) = left( frac{pi}{2} + (AB, AT) + (AT, AM) + (AC, AB) right) ] Simplifying further: [ = frac{pi}{2} + (AB, AM) + (AC, AB) ] Finally: [ = frac{pi}{2} + (AT, AC) + (AC, AB) = (B_2T, B_2B) ] since (AT) is the symmedian originating from A. Thus, showing indeed: [ (BB_2, BT) = (B_2T, B_2B) ] Conclusively, B_1 = B_2, and by analogous reasoning C_1 = C_2, hence triangle ABC and triangle AB_1C_1 are indeed similar by AAA similarity criterion.

Firstly, we have six subjects to schedule, which would typically give us 6! (factorial) arrangements. However, with the constraints for Physical Education and Mathematics, we need to adjust this calculation. - There are 5 options for which subject can go in the first period since Physical Education cannot be first. Once we choose the first subject, there are 5 remaining subjects to be placed in the second period. - The fourth period cannot be Mathematics. When placing subjects in the fourth period, we must exclude the subject placed in the first period and also exclude Mathematics. Therefore, by the time we are placing the fourth subject, there are 4 options remaining. With this in mind, we proceed with the arrangement as follows: 1. Choose a subject for the first period (not Physical Education) - 5 options 2. Place the remaining five subjects in the second, third, fifth, and sixth periods - 5! arrangements 3. Choose a subject for the fourth period (not the same as the first one and not Mathematics) - 4 options (since one subject has already been placed in the first period) Multiplying these together, the total number of possible arrangements is 5 times 5! times 4.

Since there are 5 remaining slots, and one of them is the fourth period, we can treat the fourth period as fixed for Mathematics. So we must subtract these overcounted arrangements: - Place Mathematics in the fourth period - 1 option - Choose a subject for the first period (not Physical Education and not Mathematics) - 4 options (since Mathematics is in the fourth period) - Place the remaining four subjects in the second, third, fifth, and sixth periods - 4! arrangements Thus, the number of arrangements to subtract is 1 times 4 times 4!.

We need to divide this number by 2 because we have considered the same schedules twice by calculating all arrangements for six subjects and then subtracting the ones where Mathematics is fourth, which should not be considered in the original calculation. So the correct total number of different schedules is: frac{2304}{2} = 1152 We seem to have another error since none of the options match 1152. Let's try a different approach based on the slots available rather than subjects: 1. For the first period, there are 5 options (excluding Physical Education). 2. For the fourth period, there are 4 options (excluding the subject from the first period and Mathematics). 3. The rest of the four periods can have the remaining subjects in any order, which gives us 4! arrangements. Thus, the number of arrangements should be: 5 times 4 times 4! Calculating this gives us: 5 times 4 times (4 times 3 times 2 times 1) = 20 times 24 = 480 Therefore, the total number of different arrangements for the day's schedule, considering the given constraints, is boxed{480}, and the correct answer is option C."},{"prompt":"f tan(alpha)=2 and alpha is the inclination angle of the line y = kx + b, then alpha = ______. (Express in terms of the arctangent of alpha)","completion":"Given that alpha is the inclination angle of the line y = kx + b with tan(alpha)=-2, it implies that the slope of the line is negative, and since tan(alpha) represents the slope of the line, the line is inclined in the quadrants where the tangent is negative, which are the second and fourth quadrants. Because alpha is the angle of inclination, it is measured from the positive direction of the x-axis. So, alpha should be in the second quadrant, where 90^circ < alpha < 180^circ or frac{pi}{2} < alpha < pi in radians. To find the exact angle, since alpha is in the second quadrant and the value of the tangent is positive in the second quadrant, we take the positive version of the arctangent and need to consider that arctangent gives us the angle in the first quadrant. Therefore, to find the angle in the second quadrant, we subtract the angle that arctangent gives us from pi to obtain: alpha = pi - arctan(2) We use pi - arctan(2) because arctan(2) will give the same value as arctan(-2) but for the angle in the first quadrant, and we need to reflect this across the y-axis to find the angle in the second quadrant that corresponds to the negative slope. Hence, the angle of inclination of the line is (boxed{alpha = pi - arctan(2)})."},{"prompt":"Let ( a_n = 2^n ), where ( n in mathbb{N}^{+} ).

Firstly, consider (n = 1). We then have: [ b_1 a_1 = 2 - frac{1}{2} - 1 ] Simplifying the right-hand side, [ b_1 cdot 2 = frac{1}{2} Rightarrow b_1 = frac{1}{4} ] 3. Next, consider (n geq 2).

Subtract equation (3) from equation (2) to isolate (b_n cdot 2): [ b_n cdot 2 = 2^n - frac{n}{2} - 1 - (2^n - n - 1) ] Simplifying the right-hand side, [ b_n cdot 2 = n - frac{n}{2} ] [ b_n cdot 2 = frac{n}{2} ] Therefore, [ b_n = frac{n}{4} ] 6. The product (a_n cdot b_n) is then: [ a_n cdot b_n = 2^n cdot frac{n}{4} = frac{n cdot 2^n}{4} ] 7.

Next, we calculate the total goals these 8 players have averaged per game: [8 times 1 = 8] So, these players average a total of 8 goals per game. 3. To find out how many goals these players have scored over the 15 games, we multiply the average goals per game by the number of games: [8 times 15 = 120] Therefore, these players have scored a total of 120 goals over the 15 games. 4. Finally, to find out how many total goals the other players have scored, we subtract the goals scored by these 8 players from the total goals scored by the team: [150 - 120 = 30] So, the other players have scored a total of boxed{30} goals."},{"prompt":"Calculate the length, width, and height of the box that can be assembled according to the dimensions shown in the drawing.

Simplify the third equation to find the value directly: [ b + c = frac{40}{2} = 20 ] 4. We need to find the sum of the three dimensions: [ a + b + c = frac{(a + b) + (b + c) + (c + a)}{2} ] Substitute the known sums into this equation: [ a + b + c = frac{13 + 20 + 17}{2} = frac{50}{2} = 25 ] 5.

Then: [ 9k = 2017 ] However, 2017 is not divisible by 9, making it impossible for the sum of ( n+1 ) to be 1. This contradiction establishes that the smallest possible sum must be greater than 1. 3. **Finding a feasible example:** - We need to find a number (n) such that when adding 1 to (n), the sum of the digits of (n+1) is minimized. - Let's consider the sum of the digits of (n): [ 2017 = 9 times 224 + 1 ] - This means that we can say: [ n = 1999ldots9 quad (text{where 9 repeats 224 times} and we add 1 more unit) ] - Now, let's verify: [ n = 999ldots9 quad (text{where 224 nines}) ] Adding 1 to this number: [ n+1 = 1000ldots0 quad (text{one 1 followed by 224 zeros}) ] - The digit sum of ( n+1 ) is clearly: [ 1 + 0 times 224 = 1 ] - But this contradicts our earlier finding, meaning we should include the carry correctly such that: [ sum text{digits of } n+1 = 2 ] 4. **Example Verification:** - Considering (n) of the form (1999ldots9 quad (224 text{ digits in total})): [ n + 1 = 2000ldots0 quad ] Indeed: [ 2 + 0 times (remaining digits) = 2 ] Let's verify: Sum of digits ( = 2 ) **Conclusion:** The smallest sum of the digits of (n+1), given that the sum of the digits of (n) is 2017, is 2.

Given that no three points are collinear, any choice of three points forms a triangle, and since there is only one color, the edges of this triangle are all of the same color.

It is straightforward to verify the following inequalities: [ a+b-c leq a+c-b leq b+c-a ] 3. **Calculate the difference between the largest and smallest sides:** Define ( Delta = c-a ), which is the difference between the largest and smallest sides of the original triangle. After one step of the process, this difference changes to: [ Delta_{1} = 2(c-a) ] After ( n ) steps, this difference becomes: [ Delta_{n} = 2^{n}(c-a) ] 4. **Analyze if the new triangle can be similar to the original one:** - If the new triangle were similar to the original, the similarity coefficient would need to be ( 2^{n} ). - However, consider how the sides change: the largest side increases by less than double each step. If it did double, the inequality ( b+c-a geq 2c ) would yield: [ b+c-a geq 2c Rightarrow c leq b-a ] This contradicts the requirement for side lengths since ( c ) should be greater than both ( a ) and ( b ) (as ( a leq b leq c )). 5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, a new triangle similar to the original one cannot appear in this process.

In a circle arrange any N of them. The robot, standing in any place of the circle, goes clockwise and, until one cube remains, constantly repeats this operation: destroys the two closest cubes in front of him and puts a new one behind him a cube of the same color if the destroyed ones are the same, and the third color if the destroyed two are different colors. We will call the arrangement of the cubes *good* if the color of the cube remaining at the very end does not depends on where the robot started. We call N *successful* if for any choice of N cubes all their arrangements are good. Find all successful N . I. Bogdanov","completion":"1. **Abbreviate the colors**: We abbreviate the colors as ( R, W ) and ( B ) in the obvious manner: ( W ) for White, ( R ) for Red, and ( B ) for Blue. 2. **Claim**: The answer is all powers of two. 3. **Proof for non-successful numbers**: Let ( A(n) ) and ( B(n) ) denote the following configurations: - ( A(n) ): A circle with ( n-1 ) ( R ) cubes and one ( B ) cube. - ( B(n) ): A circle with ( n-1 ) ( R ) cubes and one ( W ) cube. The dot indicates where the robot starts. We claim that: - ( A(n) ) ends in ( W ) if ( n-1 ) has an odd number of digits in binary and ( B ) otherwise. - ( B(n) ) ends in ( B ) if ( n ) has an odd number of digits in binary, and ( W ) otherwise. 4. **Base cases**: Verify small cases manually: - For ( n = 2 ), ( A(2) ) and ( B(2) ) can be checked to end in ( W ) and ( B ) respectively. - For ( n = 3 ), ( A(3) ) and ( B(3) ) can be checked to end in ( B ) and ( W ) respectively. 5. **Induction step**: - For ( A(n) ), one step results in a ( B(n-1) ) configuration with ( B ) and ( W ) switched. This means it ends with the opposite color of ( B(n-1) ), which checks out the induction step. - For ( B(n) ): - If ( n = 2k+1 ), after one full trip through the ( 2k ) ( R ) cubes, it reduces to ( A(k+1) ), and the induction step works out. - If ( n = 2k ), a full circle trip reduces the situation to ( B(k) ) with ( B ) and ( W ) swapped, and again we are good. 6. **Conclusion for non-powers of two**: ( A(n) ) and ( B(n) ) are always different as long as ( n ) isn't a power of two, proving these aren't successful. 7. **Proof for powers of two**: - Define the ( + ) operator on the symbols ( R, W, B ) as ( x + y ) being the color obtained when ( x ) and ( y ) are deleted (e.g., ( R + R = R, B + W = R )). - This operator is commutative but not associative. However, something weaker is true: - **Claim**: For any ( a, b, c, d in {R, W, B} ), we have ( (a + b) + (c + d) = (a + c) + (b + d) ). - **Proof**: Casework on all possible combinations of ( a, b, c, d ). 8. **Function definition**: For a sequence ( a_1, cdots, a_n ) with ( a_i in {R, W, B} ), define ( f(a_1, cdots, a_n) ) to be the color at the end if the initial configuration consists of cubes of color ( a_1, cdots, a_n ) clockwise around a circle and the robot starts right before ( a_1 ). 9. **Recursive relation**: [ f(a_1, cdots, a_{2^k}) = f(a_1, cdots, a_{2^{k-1}}) + f(a_{2^{k-1}+1}, a_{2^k}) ] For example: [ f(a_1, cdots, a_8) = ((a_1 + a_2) + (a_3 + a_4)) + ((a_5 + a_6) + (a_7 + a_8)) ] 10. **Stronger claim**: For ( 2^k ) cubes, not only does the initial placement of the robot not matter, the order of the cubes around the circle doesn't either. In other words, for ( a_i in {R, W, B} ), we have: [ f(a_1, cdots, a_{2^k}) = f(a_{sigma(1)}, cdots, a_{sigma(2^k)}) ] for any permutation ( sigma ) on ( {1, cdots, 2^k} ). 11. **Induction step for stronger claim**: - Let ( f(a_1, cdots, a_{2^k}) = (alpha + beta) + (gamma + delta) ), where ( alpha = f(a_1, cdots, a_{2^{k-2}}) ) and so on. - Suppose to perform the permutation ( sigma ) on the indices, ( x ) indices ( > 2^{k-1} ) need to come to the left half (become ( le 2^{k-1} )). We can assume ( x le 2^{k-2} ) (if not, ( (alpha + beta) + (gamma + delta) = (gamma + delta) + (alpha + beta) ), and permute this new expression instead). - By induction, the terms within ( alpha + beta ) and ( gamma + delta ) can be permuted freely; order them so ( beta ) contains all the ( a_i )'s with indices that need to jump from the left half to the right half, and ( gamma ) contains all those that need to jump from right to left half. - Now: [ (alpha + beta) + (gamma + delta) = (alpha + beta) + (delta + gamma) = (alpha + delta) + (beta + gamma) ] - By induction, we can reorder the terms in ( (beta + gamma) ) to form ( (beta' + gamma') ) so that the indices that need to be on the right half are all in ( gamma' ) and those to be on the left half are in ( beta' ). - Then: [ (alpha + delta) + (beta' + gamma') = (alpha + beta') + (delta + gamma') ] and thus all the indices are now in the correct half of the expression. Now we can rearrange the individual halves internally to get the correct permutation.

This implies that the sequence ({a_k}) is bounded above. 2. **Behavior of (b_k) and (c_k)**: - Given the assumption that (a_k) converges to a finite limit (a), for sufficiently large (k), (a_k) will be close to (a). Specifically, there exists (k_0) such that for all (k geq k_0), (|a_k - a| < delta) for some small (delta > 0). - Consequently, (frac{2}{b_k + c_k} < 2delta), which implies (b_k + c_k > frac{1}{delta}).

Let's start by establishing that the medians of a tetrahedron intersect at a single point. Specifically, if we show that any two medians of a tetrahedron intersect and their intersection divides them in the ratio 3:1 from the vertex, it will follow that this point also lies on the other medians. 1.1. Assume we have a tetrahedron ABCD. Let M and N be the points of intersection of the medians of the faces ABC and ABD, respectively. Let K be the midpoint of edge AB. 1.2. The plane passing through points D, K, and C contains points M and N. Furthermore, the sides CK and DK of triangle DKC are divided by these points in the ratio: [ CK:MK = DN:NK = 2:1 ] 1.3. Since the triangles KCD and KMN are similar, it follows that: [ CD:MN = KC:KM = 3:1 ] 1.4. Let O be the point where segments DM and CN intersect. Due to the similarity of triangles DOC and MON, we have: [ OD:OM = OC:ON = CD:MN = 3:1 ] This proves that the intersection point divides the segments in the ratio 3:1, confirming that the medians intersect at one point, which we'll call O. 2. Next, let's prove that the segments connecting the midpoints of opposite edges of the tetrahedron also pass through point O. 2.1. Let L be the midpoint of edge CD. Since the plane of triangle KDC contains both DM and KL, let point O' be their intersection. 2.2. Through point D, draw a line parallel to CK and label the point where this line intersects the extension of segment KL as P. Therefore, we can write: [ DP = CK, quad KM = frac{1}{3}CK = frac{1}{3}DP ] Hence: [ DO':O'M = DP:KM = 3:1 ] This implies point O' coincides with O. Similarly, this argument applies to segments connecting the midpoints of the other pairs of opposite edges, meaning they also pass through O.

If a full batch makes 21 pancakes, then with 75% of the ingredients, he would make: 0.75 * 21 = 15.75 Since Bobby can't make a fraction of a pancake, we'll round down to the nearest whole pancake. So, Bobby made 15 pancakes. Now, let's account for Alice's request for larger pancakes. If she wanted pancakes 1.5 times the regular size, each of her pancakes would count as 1.5 regular pancakes. Bobby made 4 large pancakes for her, so in terms of regular-sized pancakes, that would be: 4 large pancakes * 1.5 = 6 regular-sized pancakes Now, let's calculate how many regular-sized pancakes were made and eaten: Bobby made 15 pancakes in total. Alice's 4 large pancakes are equivalent to 6 regular-sized pancakes. Bobby ate 5 pancakes. His dog ate 7 pancakes. So, the total number of pancakes eaten is: Alice's pancakes + Bobby's pancakes + Dog's pancakes 6 + 5 + 7 = 18 pancakes However, we know that Bobby only made 15 pancakes, so there must be a mistake because the number of pancakes eaten (18) cannot be more than the number of pancakes made (15). Let's re-evaluate the situation: Bobby made 15 pancakes. Alice's 4 large pancakes are equivalent to 6 regular-sized pancakes, leaving 15 - 6 = 9 regular-sized pancakes. Bobby ate 5 of the regular-sized pancakes, leaving 9 - 5 = 4 regular-sized pancakes. The dog ate 7 pancakes, but since there were only 4 regular-sized pancakes left, the dog could only have eaten those 4. So, the correct distribution is: Alice's pancakes: 4 large pancakes (equivalent to 6 regular-sized pancakes) Bobby's pancakes: 5 regular-sized pancakes Dog's pancakes: 4 regular-sized pancakes (the remaining ones) This means that all boxed{15} pancakes were eaten, and there were no pancakes left after breakfast."},{"prompt":"The number 25! has a substantial number of positive integer divisors.

These conditions can be translated into the following equations: [ 35x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n = 592 ] [ x_1 + x_2 + cdots + 16x_n = 592 ] 3. Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the intermediate terms: [ (35x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n) - (x_1 + x_2 + cdots + 16x_n) = 592 - 592 ] Simplifying the left-hand side, we get: [ 35x_1 - x_1 - 16x_n + x_n = 0 ] Which further simplifies to: [ 34x_1 = 15x_n ] 4. The above equation can be solved for ( x_n ): [ x_n = frac{34}{15} x_1 ] 5. Since ( x_1 ) and ( x_n ) are natural numbers and the ratio (frac{34}{15}) cannot be simplified further to other integer factors, we deduce that ( x_1 ) and ( x_n ) must be multiples of 15 and 34, respectively.

This means that point A lies either inside the convex hull or on a side of the convex hull. 3. **Triangulation of the Convex Hull**: By drawing diagonals from one vertex of the convex hull to all other non-adjacent vertices, we can decompose the convex hull into triangles. 4. **Position of Point A**: Since point A is not a vertex, it must lie inside one of these triangles formed by the triangulation.

Since the 6 times 6 board has a total of 6 times 6 = 36 squares and 36 is divisible by 4, we have: [ frac{36}{4} = 9 ] Therefore, exactly 9 pieces of 1 times 4 are needed to cover the board. 2. **Corner Squares:** To completely cover the board without pieces sticking out, the placement of the 1 times 4 pieces must start covering the squares from the corners. Consider one of the situations where the piece is placed along a side that contains a corner square (like the side DC in the referred solution). 3. **Case Analysis:** - **First Case:** If a piece covers part of the side but extends inside (like in the first illustrated figure), the placement leads to other pieces forced to cover the corners.

The total time taken to process all the costumes is 9 days. - The time taken to process the first 60 sets of costumes is frac{60}{x} days, since x is the number of sets processed per day originally. - After adopting the new technology, the efficiency doubles, so the factory processes costumes at a rate of 2x sets per day.

Given the problem of determining how many ways we can insert parentheses into the product ( P = a_1 a_2 dots a_n ) (without changing the order) to indicate different ways of multiplying the numbers due to the associative property of multiplication, we define ( p_n ) to represent the number of distinct ways to fully parenthesize the product of ( n ) numbers.

We also know that: p_1 = p_2 = 1 This is because: - For ( p_1 ), there is only one number, hence, only one way to parenthesize. - For ( p_2 ), there are two numbers, and their product is straightforward: ( a_1 times a_2 ), again only one way. 4. Let's confirm this recursive formula through an example.

Our task is to prove that the locus of points of intersection of pairs of orthogonal circles passing through the points A, C and B, C is either a circle or, in special cases, a line. 2. **Assigning angles:** Let angle O_{1} C A =angle O_{1} A C = varphi and angle O_{2} C B =angle O_{2} B C = psi. Furthermore, let angle C O_{1} P = alpha. Since the circles O_{1} and O_{2} are orthogonal, angle O_{1} P O_{2} = 90^{circ}. 3. **Calculating specific angles:** Using the fact that interior angles of a triangle sum up to 180^{circ}, we get: [ angle A O_{1} P = 180^{circ} - alpha - 2varphi ] 4. **Determining half angles:** The angle angle O_{1} P A is half of 180^{circ} minus the sum of other interior angles: [ angle O_{1} P A = frac{1}{2} left[180^{circ} - (180^{circ} - alpha - 2varphi) right] = varphi + frac{alpha}{2} ] 5. **Angle computation for O_2:** Similarly, for the circle O_2: [ angle O_{2} P B = frac{1}{2} left[180^{circ} - (180^{circ} - 2psi - 180^{circ} + alpha)right] = 90^{circ} + psi - frac{alpha}{2} ] 6. **Combining results:** Summing these angles and subtracting from 360^{circ} gives us: [ angle A P B = 360^{circ} - left( varphi + frac{alpha}{2} right) - left( 90^{circ} + psi - frac{alpha}{2} right) - 90^{circ} = 180^{circ} - (varphi + psi) = 90^{circ} + angle C ] 7. **Interpreting the result:** Since the angle angle A P B is seen from point P under a constant angle, the locus of P is a circle with a constant angle subtended. 8. **Special case:** If angle C = 90^{circ}, the geometric locus becomes a line.

When the two trains pass each other completely, they will have covered a distance equal to the sum of their lengths. The total distance covered by both trains is ( 111 ) meters + ( 165 ) meters = ( 276 ) meters. We need to convert this distance to kilometers because the speed of the first train is given in km/h.

In the morning Betty catches some flies inside a bottle, and in the afternoon she catches 6 more, but when she removes the lid, one escapes. Betty wants to gather the whole week's food for her frog. She needs 4 more flies. How many flies did Betty catch in the morning?","completion":"Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. Betty's frog eats 2 flies every day. 2. Betty needs to gather a whole week's food for her frog. A week has 7 days. 3. Therefore, the frog needs 2 flies/day * 7 days/week = 14 flies for the week. Now, from the information given: 1. Betty catches some flies in the morning (let's call this number X). 2. She catches 6 more in the afternoon. 3. One fly escapes when she removes the lid, so the total number of flies she has after the afternoon is X + 6 - 1. 4. Betty needs 4 more flies to have enough for the week. We know that Betty needs 14 flies in total for the week, and she is 4 flies short. So, the number of flies she currently has is 14 - 4 = 10 flies.

Place the center at O and points where O connects as P, Q, and R on sides AB, BC, and CD respectively. The trapezoids are defined as APRO and CQRO, and the pentagon is BQROP. Step 1: Analyze the trapezoid For trapezoid APRO, let AP (and CR) be x. Since O is the center, OR = OQ = frac{1.5}{2} = 0.75 (half the length of the rectangle). Step 2: Area of the trapezoid The area of the rectangle is 3, so each subshape has an area of 1 (one-third of the total area). The area of APRO is given by [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times (text{sum of parallel sides}) times text{height} = frac{1}{2} times left(x + 0.75right) times 1. ] Setting this equal to 1 (the area of the trapezoid), [ 1 = frac{1}{2} times left(x + 0.75right) Rightarrow 2 = x + 0.75 Rightarrow x = 2 - 0.75 = 1.25. ] Conclusion: The length of the longer parallel side of each trapezoid, x, is 1.25.

If the equation f({|{{{log}_2}x}|})+frac{{2m}}{{|{{{log}_2}x}|}}3m1=0 has four distinct real number solutions, find the range of real number m.","completion":"1. To find the values of a and b, we analyze the given conditions for the function g(x)=ax^{2}-2ax+b within the interval xin [1,2]: - **Case 1: a=0** - If a=0, then g(x)=b. Since b>0 and we need both a maximum of 1 and a minimum of 0, this case does not satisfy the conditions. - **Case 2: a>0** - For a>0, the function g(x) is symmetric about x=1 and is monotonically increasing in the interval [1,2]. To meet the conditions of having a maximum value of 1 and a minimum value of 0, we find that a=b=1 satisfies the requirements. - **Case 3: a<0** - For a<0, the function g(x) is still symmetric about x=1 but is monotonically decreasing in the interval [1,2]. In this scenario, we would find a=-1 and b=0 to satisfy the symmetry and monotonicity, but since b>0 is a requirement, this case does not meet the conditions. Therefore, the only valid solution is when a=b=1. So, we have boxed{a=1, b=1}. 2. For the inequality g(2^{x})-kcdot 4^{x}+1geqslant 0 to hold for xin [-1,1], we substitute t=2^{x}, which means tin [frac{1}{2},2]. The inequality then becomes t^{2}-2t+1-kt^{2}+1geqslant 0 for tin [frac{1}{2},2]. Simplifying, we get (1-k)t^{2}-2t+2geqslant 0. The condition for k can be derived as kleqslant 2(frac{1}{t})^{2}-2(frac{1}{t})+1 for tin [frac{1}{2},2]. Evaluating this at t=2, we find the minimum value of the expression on the right side to be frac{1}{2}. Therefore, the range for k is boxed{kin (-infty,frac{1}{2}]}. 3. Let s=|log _{2}x|>0. The equation f({|{{{log}_2}x}|})+frac{{2m}}{{|{{{log}_2}x}|}}-3m-1=0 transforming into f(s)+frac{2m}{s}-3m-1=0 implies that we are looking for conditions under which this equation has two distinct real solutions for s>0. This leads to a quadratic equation in s: s^{2}-3(m+1)s+2m+1=0. For two distinct real solutions, the discriminant (Δ) must be positive, and the coefficients must satisfy certain conditions: - Δ=9(m+1)^{2}-4(2m+1)>0 ensures two distinct solutions. - 3(m+1)>0 ensures that the quadratic opens upwards. - 2m+1>0 ensures that the constant term is positive. Combining these conditions, we find that m>-frac{1}{2}.
