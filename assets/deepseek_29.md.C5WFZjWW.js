Aaron eats half of each of the flavored sweets, so he eats half of the cherry-flavored sweets, half of the 40 strawberry-flavored sweets, and half of the 50 pineapple-flavored sweets. Then he gives away 5 cherry-flavored sweets to his friend. After eating half of the cherry-flavored sweets, there are C/2 left. After eating half of the strawberry-flavored sweets, there are 40/2 = 20 left. After eating half of the pineapple-flavored sweets, there are 50/2 = 25 left. Now, we subtract the 5 cherry-flavored sweets that Aaron gives to his friend from the remaining cherry-flavored sweets: C/2 - 5. The total number of sweets left in the packet after Aaron eats and gives some away is the sum of the remaining cherry-flavored sweets, the remaining strawberry-flavored sweets, and the remaining pineapple-flavored sweets, which equals 55 sweets.

Conclusion: In both cases, we have shown that there exists a constant (K) such that every set of (K) consecutive elements of the arithmetic progression ({a + nd}_{n=1}^infty) contains at least one number which is not prime.

In this case, the grid is ( 1 times 1 ), and we only need to place the single number 1 in the only available cell. This trivially satisfies the condition since there are no repeated numbers in the \\"cross\\" formed by the 1st row and 1st column, which each consist of the single cell itself. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Suppose that it is possible to fill a table of size ( 2^n times 2^n ) according to the given criteria. That means, for any ( k ) from 1 to ( 2^n ), the cross formed by the ( k )-th row and the ( k )-th column has all unique numbers ranging from 1 to ( 2 cdot 2^n - 1 ). 3. **Construct the ( 2^{n+1} times 2^{n+1} ) Table:** Consider a table of size ( 2^{n+1} times 2^{n+1} ). We will sub-divide this larger table into four smaller tables of size ( 2^n times 2^n ). - Label the four ( 2^n times 2^n ) sub-tables as ( T_1, T_2, T_3, ) and ( T_4 ). - Place two copies of the original ( 2^n times 2^n ) table (filled according to our inductive hypothesis) in sub-tables ( T_1 ) and ( T_4 ) on the diagonal. 4. **Numbering the Tables:** The table ( T_1 ) and ( T_4 ) will hold the numbers from 1 to ( 2 cdot 2^n - 1 ) (just as the inductive hypothesis assures us). We now need to place numbers in ( T_2 ) and ( T_3 ) using the next set of numbers, specifically from ( 2 cdot 2^n ) to ( 2^{n+1} - 1 ). 5. **Filling ( T_2 ) and ( T_3 ):** To do this without repeating any numbers within the same row or column and maintaining the separation: - Assign numbers from ( 2 cdot 2^n ) to ( 2^{n+2} - 1 ) to the cells in ( T_2 ) and ( T_3 ), making sure that no new number overlaps with the ones in the corresponding rows and columns of ( T_1 ) and ( T_4 ). - For example, you can consistently add a fixed value (say ( 2^n )) to each number in the first ( 2^n times 2^n ) table when placing it into ( T_2 ) and continue similarly for ( T_3 ). 6. **Verification:** By construction: - The numbers in each sub-table ( T_1, T_2, T_3, ) and ( T_4 ) are correctly placed such that within each sub-table, there are no repeated numbers in each cross. - The indices of numbers spread between ( T_1 ), ( T_2 ), ( T_3, ) and ( T_4 ) ensure that these ( 2^{n+1} times 2^{n+1} ) tables do not have repeat values in any row or column connecting the sub-tables.

Let a be a number such that the number N becomes ( a^2 ) when the last two digits of N are crossed out. 2. We need to investigate the properties of ( N ). Specifically, [ N = 100k + n ] where ( k ) represents the integer part and ( n ) represents the last two digits (which range from 00 to 99). 3. By crossing out the last two digits of N, we are left with a^2, which leads to the relation: [ k = a^2 quad text{and} quad 10a leq sqrt{N} < 10a + 10 ] 4. Thus, ( N ) can be represented as: [ N = 100a^2 + n ] where ( n ) is the last two digits. 5. Next, we replace the modular conditions: [ 100a^2 leq N < 100(a^2 + 1) ] 6. To ensure that ( sqrt{N} ) is an integer, we have: [ sqrt{N} geq 10a + 1 implies N geq (10a + 1)^2 ] 7.

We start by considering the polynomial ( n^4 - 2n^2 + 9 ) modulo ( p ). We need to show that there exist positive integers ( a, b, c ) not all divisible by ( p ) such that for all positive integers ( n ) satisfying ( p mid n^4 - 2n^2 + 9 ), we have ( p mid 24an^2 + 5bn + 2011c ). 2. First, note that since ( p > 2011 ), the constants ( 24, 5, ) and ( 2011 ) are invertible modulo ( p ). This is because ( p ) is a prime and does not divide any of these constants. 3. We need to prove that the polynomial ( X^4 - 2X^2 + 9 ) factors modulo ( p ). Suppose this is not the case. We can rewrite the polynomial as: [ X^4 - 2X^2 + 9 = (X^2 - 1)^2 + 8 ] This implies that ( -8 ) (and hence ( -2 )) is not a quadratic residue modulo ( p ). 4. If ( X^4 - 2X^2 + 9 ) does not factor modulo ( p ), then there are no solutions to the equation: [ (X^2 + aX + b)(X^2 - aX + b) = X^4 - 2X^2 + 9 ] in ( mathbb{Z}_p[X] ). This implies there are no solutions to the system: [ a^2 - 2b equiv 2 pmod{p}, quad b^2 equiv 9 pmod{p} ] 5. Solving ( b^2 equiv 9 pmod{p} ), we get ( b equiv pm 3 pmod{p} ).

Thus, we need ( 8 ) and ( -4 ) to be quadratic residues modulo ( p ). If neither ( -4 ) nor ( 8 ) is a quadratic residue, then neither ( -1 ) nor ( 2 ) nor ( -2 ) is a quadratic residue. This is impossible because the product of two non-residues is a residue. 7. Therefore, ( X^4 - 2X^2 + 9 ) must factor modulo ( p ).

The formula for the area ( S_{ABC} ) in terms of these distances can be written as: [ 2S_{ABC} = a d_a + b d_b + c d_c ] Here, ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ) are the lengths of the sides opposite to vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) respectively. 2. **Apply the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality):** To maximize the product ( (a d_a)(b d_b)(c d_c) ), we apply the AM-GM Inequality which states: [ frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3} geq sqrt[3]{x_1 x_2 x_3} ] Equality holds if and only if ( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 ). 3. **Set the Terms Equal:** For the maximum product, we set ( a d_a = b d_b = c d_c ). This means each term must be equal. Therefore, we have: [ a d_a = b d_b = c d_c ] 4. **Interpret Geometrically:** Setting ( a d_a = b d_b = c d_c ) means that the areas of the smaller triangles formed by point ( O ) with each pair of sides of ( triangle ABC ) are equal.

This implies that none of the coefficients can be zero, and all coefficients must have the same sign. 8. **Coefficient Analysis**: - If any coefficient were zero, the other two vectors would be scalar multiples of each other, placing all three vectors in a half-plane, which contradicts our condition. - Therefore, the coefficients must be non-zero. - Among the three coefficients, there must be two with the same sign. Without loss of generality, assume these are a_{1} and a_{2}. - If a_{3} has the opposite sign, then u_{3} can be expressed as a positive linear combination of u_{1} and u_{2}: [ u_{3} = -frac{a_{1}}{a_{3}} u_{1} + -frac{a_{2}}{a_{3}} u_{2} ] This places u_{3} within the angular region spanned by u_{1} and u_{2}, making all three vectors lie in a half-plane, a contradiction. 9. **Correct Coefficient Signs and Non-negativity**: - Therefore, the coefficients must all be of the same sign. - Let the coordinates of u_{i} be x_{i} and y_{i}. It can be verified that: [ (x_{2} y_{3} - x_{3} y_{2}) u_{1} + (x_{3} y_{1} - x_{1} y_{3}) u_{2} + (x_{1} y_{2} - x_{2} y_{1}) u_{3} = 0 ] - In this identity, the coefficients are integers and non-zero unless the respective vectors are parallel.

If they are all negative, their opposites can be chosen.

Thus, the progression of the algae cover works backwards exponentially by halving every 2 days starting from full coverage (100%). 1. On day 34, the pond was 50% covered (half of 100%). 2. On day 32, the pond was 25% covered (half of 50%). 3. On day 30, the pond was 12.5% covered (half of 25%). To find when the pond was only 10% covered, we notice that on day 30 the coverage was just above 10%. Since the coverage doubles every 2 days, and the coverage is strictly increasing, the task is to find a threshold slightly before reaching 12.5%. Therefore, between day 32 and day 30, the pond's algae coverage passed through 10% coverage. Since this growth model doesn't indicate exact daily growth, but a general halving every 2 days, we conclude that the pond was 10% covered just **after** day 32 but **before** day 30.

So we have: [ (rho cos theta)^2 - 4(rho cos theta) + (rho sin theta)^2 = 0 ] [ rho^2 (cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta) - 4rho cos theta = 0 ] Since cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta = 1, the equation becomes: [ rho^2 - 4rho cos theta = 0 ] Factor out rho, we get: [ rho(rho - 4cos theta) = 0 ] As rho represents the distance from the origin to points on the curve and cannot be zero, we have: [ rho - 4cos theta = 0 ] So the polar equation of C_1 is: [ boxed{rho = 4cos theta} ] (2) To find the intersection points A and B, we solve the system of polar equations: [ begin{cases} rho = 4cos theta rho sin theta = sqrt{3} end{cases} ] Substitute rho from the first equation into the second equation and get: [ 4sin theta cos theta = sqrt{3} ] Using the double-angle identity sin 2theta = 2sin theta cos theta, we can rewrite this as: [ sin 2theta = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} ] Therefore: [ 2theta = kpi + frac{pi}{3} quad text{or} quad 2theta = kpi + frac{2pi}{3} quad (k in mathbb{Z}) ] When theta = kpi + frac{pi}{6} (k in mathbb{Z}), we have rho = 2sqrt{3}.

Therefore, the polar coordinates of the intersection points of C_1 and C_2 are: A(2sqrt{3}, kpi + frac{pi}{6}), B(2, kpi + frac{pi}{3}).

Since we already know that F = 0, this simplifies to 16 + 4D = 0, which further simplifies to 4D = -16 and hence D = -4. 3. Substituting (-1,1) into the equation gives us 1 + 1 - D + E + F = 0. Substituting D = -4 and F = 0 into this equation, we get 2 + 4 + E = 0, which simplifies to E = -6. Therefore, the equation of the circle passing through the points (0,0), (4,0), and (-1,1) is x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 6y = 0. Similarly, for the other sets of points, we would follow the same process of substituting the points into the general equation of a circle and solving for D, E, and F. The equations of the circles passing through the given sets of points are as follows: - For points (0,0), (4,0), and (4,2), the equation is x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 2y = 0. - For points (0,0), (-1,1), and (4,2), the equation is x^2 + y^2 - frac{8}{3}x - frac{14}{3}y = 0. - For points (4,0), (-1,1), and (4,2), the equation is x^2 + y^2 - frac{16}{5}x - 2y - frac{16}{5} = 0. Therefore, the final answer, encapsulating all possible equations of circles passing through the given points, is: boxed{x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 6y = 0 quad text{(or)} quad x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 2y = 0 quad text{(or)} quad x^2 + y^2 - frac{8}{3}x - frac{14}{3}y = 0 quad text{(or)} quad x^2 + y^2 - frac{16}{5}x - 2y - frac{16}{5} = 0}"},{"prompt":"Consider a set of 10 elements consisting of positive integers with at most two digits. Prove that this set always contains two disjoint subsets whose elements have the same sum.","completion":"1. **Define the Set and Subsets:** Let the given set of numbers be ( H ). Let ( A subseteq H ) be any subset of ( H ). 2. **Calculate Sum Range:** - The sum of the elements in subset ( A ) is at least 0 (which occurs if ( A ) is the empty set). - The sum of elements in ( A ) is at most the sum of all elements in ( H ). - Since ( H ) consists of at most two-digit positive integers, the largest sum is less than ( 10 times 99 = 990 ). Therefore, the sum of the numbers in any subset ( A ) can take an integer value between 0 and 989. 3. **Calculate Number of Subsets:** - The set ( H ) has 10 elements. - Therefore, ( H ) has ( 2^{10} = 1024 ) subsets (including the empty set and ( H ) itself). 4. **Apply the Pigeonhole Principle:** - By the Pigeonhole Principle, if there are more \\"pigeons\\" than \\"pigeonholes\\", at least one \\"pigeonhole\\" must contain more than one \\"pigeon\\". - Here, the \\"pigeonholes\\" are the possible sum values from 0 to 989, totaling 990. - The \\"pigeons\\" are the 1024 subsets of ( H ). - Since 1024 (number of subsets) > 990 (number of possible sums), there must exist at least two different subsets of ( H ) that have the same sum. 5. **Form Two Sum-Equal Subsets Without Common Elements:** - Let ( B ) and ( C ) be two different subsets of ( H ) with the same sum. - By removing common elements of ( B ) and ( C ) (if any), we obtain two new subsets ( B' subseteq B ) and ( C' subseteq C ). - These subsets ( B' ) and ( C' ) are still distinct and have the same sum, but do not share any common elements. 6. **Conclusion:** We have thus demonstrated that any set ( H ) of 10 positive integers, each at most two digits, necessarily has two disjoint subsets (with no common elements) whose sums are the same.

According to the information given: - 12 dogs are running. - Half of the dogs are playing with toys, so that's D/2. - A fourth of the dogs are barking, so that's D/4. - 10 dogs are not doing anything. We can assume that each dog is only doing one of the mentioned activities or doing nothing. Therefore, we can add up all these numbers to find the total number of dogs: 12 (running) + D/2 (playing with toys) + D/4 (barking) + 10 (doing nothing) = D To solve for D, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 4.

When they work together, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates, which is ( frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{k} ) of the room per hour. We know that together they can clean the room in 4.8 hours, so their combined rate is ( frac{1}{4.8} ) of the room per hour. Setting the combined rate equal to the sum of their individual rates, we get: [ frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{k} = frac{1}{4.8} ] To solve for ( k ), we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side of the equation, which is ( 8k ): [ frac{k}{8k} + frac{8}{8k} = frac{1}{4.8} ] [ frac{k + 8}{8k} = frac{1}{4.8} ] Now we cross-multiply to solve for ( k ): [ (k + 8) cdot 4.8 = 8k ] [ 4.8k + 38.4 = 8k ] Subtract ( 4.8k ) from both sides: [ 38.4 = 3.2k ] Now divide both sides by 3.2 to solve for ( k ): [ k = frac{38.4}{3.2} ] [ k = 12 ] So, it takes Kay boxed{12} hours to clean her room alone."},{"prompt":"Let ( P P_{1} P_{2} cdots P_{n} ) be a regular ( n )sided polygon inscribed in circle ( O ), with ( P ) being any point on circle ( O ).

Since the remainders when dividing by 35 and D are 25 and 4, respectively, we can infer that D must be greater than 25 (otherwise, the remainder would not be 25 when dividing by 35). We also know that the difference between the two remainders (25 and 4) must be a multiple of D. This is because when we subtract the second equation from the first, we get: (35k + 25) - (Dm + 4) = 21 21 = 35k - Dm + 21 Since 21 is a multiple of 7, we can infer that D could be a factor of 21.

Since a_1=1, by induction, all terms are positive. **Step 2: Checking if the sequence is decreasing** To check if the sequence is decreasing, we compare a_{n+1} with a_n: a_{n+1} = frac{a_n}{a_n^2+1} The ratio frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = frac{1}{a_n^2+1} < 1 since a_n^2+1 > 1 for all n. This implies a_{n+1} < a_n, confirming the sequence is decreasing. Thus, option A is correct. **Step 3: Verifying the range of a_n** Since the sequence is decreasing and starts at a_1=1, we have 0 < a_n leqslant 1 for all n. Hence, option B is correct. **Step 4: Analyzing {a_{10}}** Taking reciprocals and squaring, we get: frac{1}{a_{n+1}} = frac{1}{a_n} + a_n Squaring both sides: (frac{1}{a_{n+1}})^2 = (frac{1}{a_n})^2 + 2 + a_n^2 This implies: (frac{1}{a_{n+1}})^2 - (frac{1}{a_n})^2 = 2 + a_n^2 Since a_n is decreasing and a_2 = frac{1}{2}, we have for n geqslant 2: 2 < 2 + a_n^2 < 2 + frac{1}{4} Summing up these inequalities from n=2 to n+1, we find: 2n + 2 < (frac{1}{a_{n+1}})^2 < frac{9n+7}{4} For n=9 (to find a_{10}), we get: 20 < (frac{1}{a_{10}})^2 < 22 This does not directly imply {a_{10}}∈(frac{1}{8},frac{1}{7}), so we cannot confirm option C without further calculation. However, based on the given solution, option C is deemed incorrect. **Step 5: Analyzing {a_{50}}** Using the inequality 2n + 2 < (frac{1}{a_{n+1}})^2 < frac{9n+7}{4} for n=49 (to find a_{50}), we get: 100 < (frac{1}{a_{50}})^2 < 112 This implies: frac{1}{11} < a_{50} < frac{1}{10} Therefore, option D is correct. **Conclusion** The correct options are A, B, and D.

The only number that fits the criteria is 49. Since there's only one number, the average is the number itself, which is 49. Now, let's find the sum of the square roots of this number.

(2) A line passing through point (2, 6) and intersecting C at a chord of length 4 can have two scenarios: either it is vertical, or it has a slope. For the vertical scenario, if the line is of the form x = a and intersects the circle creating a chord of length 4, we check the distance from (2, 6) to the line x - 3 = 0 which corresponds to our circle's center. As (2, 6) is already on the vertical line x = 2 and is 1 unit away from the circle's center (3, 1) in the x-coordinate, this line is indeed a solution. Therefore, one line is: [ x = 2 ] For the scenario with a slope, let's assume a line with the slope-intercept form y - 6 = k(x - 2), or equivalently: [ kx - y - 2k + 6 = 0 ] Since the distance from this line to the center of the circle (3, 1) must be half the chord length, which is 2, we can use the distance formula for a point to a line: [ text{Distance} = frac{|k(3) - 1 - 2k + 6|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1^2}} = frac{|3k + 5 - 2k|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 2 ] Solving for k: [ frac{|k + 5|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 2 ] Squaring both sides: [ (k + 5)^2 = 4(k^2 + 1) ] Expanding: [ k^2 + 10k + 25 = 4k^2 + 4 ] Bringing terms to one side: [ 3k^2 - 10k - 21 = 0 ] We can solve this quadratic equation for k.

Thus, the minimum value of g(x) is g(-frac{1}{a}) = M. Setting t = -frac{1}{a} which lies in the interval (0, e^2], we define M = h(t) = frac{t}{e^2} - ln(t) + 1, where 0 < t leq e^2.

Therefore, -2x^2 + ax - 1 leq 0. This inequality must hold for all x > 0, which implies a leq 2x + frac{1}{x} for all x > 0.

With a=1, the function f(x) simplifies to f(x) = x - ln x. Differentiating f(x): f'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} = frac{x-1}{x}. We find that f(x) is decreasing on (0,1) and increasing on (1,e). Thus f(x)_{min} = f(1) = 1. To find the maximum of g(x): g'(x) = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2}. Setting g'(x) = 0 yields x = e. g(x) is increasing on (0,e) and decreasing on (e, +infty), thus g(x)_{max} = g(e) = frac{1}{e}. But since e > 2, we have frac{1}{e} + frac{1}{2} < 1.

First, finding the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = a - frac{1}{x} = frac{ax - 1}{x}. - If a leq 0, f'(x) leq 0, which means f(x) is decreasing over (0,e].

If f(x) geqslant 3 for all x, then ae - 1 geqslant 3, implying a geqslant frac{4}{e}, which contradicts a leq 0. - If a > 0, solving f'(x) = 0 gives x = frac{1}{a}. Now, if frac{1}{a} leq e (or a geqslant frac{1}{e}), f(x) has its minimum when x = frac{1}{a}. We seek to determine whether fleft(frac{1}{a}right) = aleft(frac{1}{a}right) - ln left(frac{1}{a}right) is always greater than or equal to 3. Solving this inequality gives a geq e^2. - If frac{1}{a} > e (or a < frac{1}{e}), then f(x) is decreasing for all x in (0,e], and the minimum would again be at x = e, leading to the previously contradicted case.

We are given ( p+1 ) distinct positive integers. We need to show that among these integers, there exist two numbers such that the larger number divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd) is at least ( p+1 ). 2. **Lemma Proof:** Let's first establish a useful lemma. For any two positive integers ( a, b ) with ( a > b ) and prime ( p ): ( a equiv b pmod{p} ). We need to demonstrate: [ frac{a}{(a, b)} geq p + 1, ] where ( (a, b) ) denotes the gcd of ( a ) and ( b ). Suppose ( a = b + p cdot q ), with ( q in mathbb{N}^* ) (i.e., ( q ) is a positive integer), then: [ (a, b) mid p cdot q, ] but ( p nmid (a, b) ). Consequently, we have: [ (a, b) mid q. ] Thus, we can rewrite: [ frac{a}{(a, b)} = frac{b + p cdot q}{(a, b)} = frac{b}{(a, b)} + frac{p cdot q}{(a, b)}. ] Since ( frac{p cdot q}{(a, b)} geq p ) and ( frac{b}{(a, b)} geq 1 ), we deduce: [ frac{a}{(a, b)} geq 1 + p. ] Hence, the lemma is proven. 3. **Applying the Lemma to Solve the Problem:** Returning to the original problem, we assume the given ( p+1 ) numbers are distinct. If all these numbers are multiples of ( p ), after dividing all numbers by ( p ), we again get distinct numbers: ( p ). 4. **Considering Non-Multiples of ( p ):** Assume at least some of these ( p+1 ) numbers are not multiples of ( p ). Label these numbers as: [ x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k, x_{k+1} = p^{alpha_{k+1}} y_{k+1}, ldots, x_{p+1} = p^{alpha_{p+1}} y_{p+1}, ] where ( k ) is a positive integer, and none of ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k, y_{k+1}, ldots, y_{p+1} ) are multiples of ( p ). Additionally, ( alpha_{k+1}, ldots, alpha_{p+1} ) are positive integers, and ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k ) are all distinct. 5. **Analyzing Cases:** - **Case 1:** If there are three identical numbers among ( x_1, x_2, ldots, y_{k+1}, ldots, y_{p+1} ), we can argue: - If ( y_{k+1}, ldots, y_{p+1} ) have three identical numbers with different powers of ( p ), there are two numbers whose ratio is at least ( p^2 ). These two numbers meet the problem's condition. - If there exists ( r, s, t ) such that ( x_r = y_s = y_t ), then at least one of the ( alpha_s ) or ( alpha_t ) is ( geq 2 ). Without loss of generality, assume ( alpha_t geq 2 ). Then ( x_r ) and ( x_t = p^{alpha_t} y_t ) satisfy the required condition. - **Case 2:** No three numbers among ( x_1, x_2, ldots, y_{k+1}, ldots, y_{p+1} ) are identical: - If two identical numbers exist in ( y_{k+1}, ldots, y_{p+1} ) with their powers of ( p ) having a minimum difference of ( 2 ), then the condition is met. - If all such identical numbers differ by only ( 1 ) in powers of ( p ), assume the numbers are ( c, cp, d, dp ) (( c < d )). Then: [ frac{dp}{gcd(c, dp)} geq frac{dp}{c} > p. ] Hence, [ frac{dp}{gcd(c, dp)} ge p + 1. ] 6. **Combining all cases:** We conclude by examining ( x_1, ldots, x_k, y_{k+1}, ldots, y_{p+1} ). Among these, find ( p ) numbers which are not multiples of ( p ). Therefore, at least two of these have the same remainder mod ( p ): - If ( x_r equiv x_t pmod{p} ) for some ( 1 leq r < t leq k ): [ text{By the lemma, the required condition is easily satisfied.} ] - If ( x_r equiv y_t pmod{p} ) for some ( r neq t ): [ text{By applying the lemma method, the condition is satisfied.} ] Thus, in all scenarios, the condition as described in the problem is met.

For each vector vec{a}_i, draw the ray starting from the origin O and passing through the unit circle. Let this ray intersect the unit circle at point A_i. 4. If the point A_i is such that the vector overrightarrow{OA_i} is in the same direction as the corresponding vector vec{a}_i, color the point A_i red. If overrightarrow{OA_i} is in the opposite direction to vec{a}_i, color the point A_i blue. 5. Due to the problem's condition, for any two distinct indices i and j, there exists a vector of the form x vec{a}_i + y vec{a}_j where x and y are negative numbers. This indicates that combining two vectors always results in a position pointing within the negative direction of the plane. 6. Consequently, the red and blue points on the unit circle must alternate. Additionally, diametrically opposite points on the circle (i.e., theta and theta + pi) must be colored differently. 7. Now, enumerate the points on the unit circle as A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2n}, going in order around the circle. Suppose A_1 is red. 8. According to our established color pattern, the point A_{n+1}, which is diametrically opposite to A_1, must be blue. 9. Since the points alternate in color, and A_{n+1} must be blue, the set of points from A_1 to A_{n+1} contains exactly n + 1 points. 10. The fact that the points from A_1 through A_{n+1} include an equal number of reds and blues (with one more red) means that n must be such that the total count of these points gives an odd split.

Drop perpendiculars from (P) to the sides (CD) and (DA), and let the feet of these perpendiculars be (X) and (Y) respectively. Let (DX = x) and (DY = y). 3. **Analyze distances:** The distances from (P) to the vertices (D) and (C) can be expressed as: [ PD = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} quad text{and} quad PC = sqrt{(b-x)^2 + y^2} ] Since (PD) and (PC) are integers, the differences of their squares must also be integers: [ PD^2 - PC^2 = x^2 + y^2 - ((b-x)^2 + y^2) = x^2 - (b-x)^2 = x^2 - (b^2 - 2bx + x^2) = 2bx - b^2 ] Therefore, (2bx - b^2) must be an integer.

Since (PD) and (PC) are integers, we have: [ sqrt{left(frac{c}{d}right)^2 + left(frac{e}{f}right)^2} = frac{sqrt{c^2 + e^2}}{d} ] For this to be an integer, (frac{sqrt{c^2 + e^2}}{d}) must be an integer, implying (sqrt{c^2 + e^2}) must be divisible by (d). 5. **Analyze the parity of (c) and (e):** Since (c^2 + e^2) must be a perfect square, and the sum of two odd squares cannot be a perfect square, at least one of (c) or (e) must be even. Without loss of generality, assume (c) is even. Since (gcd(c,d) = 1), (d) must be odd. 6. **Consider the cases for (e):** - If (e) is even, then both (c) and (e) are even, which contradicts (gcd(e,f) = 1). - If (e) is odd, consider the distance (PB): [ PB = sqrt{(b - frac{c}{d})^2 + (a - frac{e}{f})^2} = frac{sqrt{(bd - c)^2 + (ad - e)^2}}{d} ] Since (bd - c) and (ad - e) are both odd (as (b) and (a) are odd, and (c) is even, (e) is odd), the sum of two odd squares is not a perfect square, thus (PB) is not an integer. 7. **Conclusion:** Since in all cases, the distances from (P) to the vertices cannot all be integers, there does not exist a point (P) inside the rectangle with integer distances to each of the four vertices.

The triangle triangle ABC being isosceles (and using argument similar as triangle CDE) theta = angle BAC = angle ABC = frac{180^circ - 140^circ}{2} = 20^circ. So, theta = 20^circ.

This follows from the theorem stating that if a polynomial with rational coefficients has a non-rational root, the conjugate of this root must also be a root. 3. Therefore, we have two roots as x_1 = 2 + sqrt{3} and x_2 = 2 - sqrt{3}.

From the initial heads, there is a ( left(1 - frac{1}{2^{2009}}right) ) probability that Rosencrantz does not lose immediately (i.e., there isn't a run of 2009 tails in a row following the head), and hence we are effectively considering two cases: - **A heads followed by a non-2009-long sequence of tails**, which leads us back to the beginning, giving a probability ( x ) for Rosencrantz. - **A heads followed by a 2009-long sequence of tails**, which is a loss for Rosencrantz. 5. Thus, for sequences that do not immediately lead to a loss, the relevant sequence (HT followed by something else) lets us consider ( y ), the probability conditioned on an initial HT segment.

After every kilometre, he takes rest for 5 minutes. He takes 50 minutes to cover a distance of 5 kilometres. What is his speed in km per hour?","completion":"To calculate the man's speed in km per hour, we need to determine the total time he spent walking and the total distance he covered. The man covers a distance of 5 kilometres, and after every kilometre, he takes a 5-minute rest. Since he covers 5 kilometres, he would take a rest 4 times (after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th kilometres, but not after the 5th since he's finished). Total rest time = 4 rests * 5 minutes/rest = 20 minutes The total time taken to cover 5 kilometres is 50 minutes, which includes both walking and resting time. To find the walking time, we subtract the rest time from the total time. Walking time = Total time - Rest time Walking time = 50 minutes - 20 minutes Walking time = 30 minutes Now, we convert the walking time from minutes to hours to find the speed in km/h. Walking time in hours = 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.5 hours The man covers 5 kilometres in 0.5 hours. To find his speed, we divide the distance by the time.

This leads to a contradiction because ( p_a ) cannot divide 2, an even number. 8. **Conclusion about distinct primes**: Hence, our initial assumption that ( p_a = p_b ) must be false. Therefore, the prime factors ( p_k ) are distinct for different values of ( k ). 9. **Bound on primes**: Each prime ( p_k ) is less than or equal to ( F_k ) and hence less than or equal to ( F_n ). 10. **Conclusion**: Since ( k ) ranges from ( 0 ) to ( n ), this provides us with ( n+1 ) distinct prime factors all less than or equal to ( F_n ). Thus, it is established that there exist at least ( n + 1 ) prime numbers less than or equal to ( F_n ).

The circumcenter is the point equidistant from the vertices C, A_1, and B_1. 2. **Properties of the right triangle:** - In a right triangle triangle ABC with angle C = 90^circ, the hypotenuse AB is the diameter of the circumcircle of triangle ABC. - The midpoint M of the hypotenuse AB is the circumcenter of triangle ABC. 3. **Position of I and O:** - Since I is the incenter, it lies on the angle bisectors of angle A and angle B. - The circumcenter O of triangle CA_1B_1 lies on the perpendicular bisector of A_1B_1. 4. **Perpendicularity condition:** - To prove OI perp AB, we need to show that the line segment OI is perpendicular to the hypotenuse AB. 5. **Using the properties of the incenter and circumcenter:** - The incenter I of triangle ABC is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and it is known that the incenter of a right triangle lies on the angle bisector of the right angle. - The circumcenter O of triangle CA_1B_1 is equidistant from C, A_1, and B_1. 6. **Using the right triangle properties:** - In a right triangle, the incenter I lies on the angle bisector of the right angle, which is perpendicular to the hypotenuse AB. - The circumcenter O of triangle CA_1B_1 lies on the perpendicular bisector of A_1B_1, which is also perpendicular to AB. 7. **Conclusion:** - Since both I and O lie on lines that are perpendicular to AB, the line segment OI must also be perpendicular to AB.

However, we also need to include the children who can speak both Hindi and English in the total number of children who can speak Hindi.

To check if a triangle can exist with these sides, we apply the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Here, we have: [4 + 4 < 9] This shows that the sides 4cm, 4cm, and 9cm cannot form a triangle because the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides is not greater than the length of the longest side. **Case 2: The legs are each 9cm long.** In this configuration, the sides of the triangle would be 4cm, 9cm, and 9cm. Again, applying the triangle inequality theorem to check for the validity of this triangle, we have: [9 + 9 > 4] This inequality is true, indicating that a triangle with sides 4cm, 9cm, and 9cm is possible. The perimeter of this triangle is calculated by summing the lengths of all three sides: [4 + 9 + 9 = 22,cm] Therefore, the perimeter of the isosceles triangle, when the legs are each 9cm long, is 22cm.

Together, the big and small horses total 100. This gives us our first equation: [x + y = 100] 2. One big horse can pull 3 pieces of tiles, and three small horses can pull 1 piece of tile.

Thus, ( gcd(q, m - 1) = 0 ), so ( m ) is not congruent to ( 1 pmod{q} ). 6.

This is because the numerator x^n + x^m - 2 is monic and the denominator x^{gcd(m,n)} - 1 does not affect the leading coefficient. 3. **Magnitude of Roots:** We claim that all roots of f(x) have magnitude greater than 1.

Without loss of generality, assume g(x) has a constant term of pm 1. Since all complex roots of g(x) are roots of f(x) and have magnitude greater than 1, this leads to a contradiction because a polynomial with constant term pm 1 cannot have all roots with magnitude greater than 1.

We need to show that the lines AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, and the line passing through the incenter and the excenter intersect at a single point. Let's start by noting the definitions: - A_1 is the reflection of the point of tangency of the incircle on BC with respect to the angle bisector of angle A. - Similarly, B_1 and C_1 are defined for AC and AB, respectively. Step 1: Properties of the Reflections and Tangency Points Since A_1 is the reflection of the tangency point concerning BC, it lies on the tangent to the incircle at the tangency point. The same holds for B_1 and C_1 with respect to their corresponding sides. Step 2: Coordinate Geometry Setup Set the given geometry in a coordinate system with A, B, and C having coordinates (x_A, y_A), (x_B, y_B), and (x_C, y_C) respectively. Denote D, E, F as the tangency points of the incircle with BC, CA, and AB. By properties of reflection: - A_1 is the reflection of D, so A_1 will have specific coordinates derived symmetrically with respect to the bisector method. Step 3: Establishing Collinearity Using properties of symmetry and the fact that I lies on all internal angle bisectors: - AA_1 will be perpendicular to the angle bisector at angle A since A_1 is reflected over it. - Similar arguments apply for BB_1 and CC_1. Thus, the lines AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, collectively maintain a symmetric and bisector form, ensuring the tangency and reflection properties with the bisectors and the tangents' collinearities. Step 4: Radical Axis and Intersection Theory Using principles from radical axes: - The system defined by the incenter and excenter coordinates aligns the radical axis theorem. - Hence, the intersection point lies on the radical axis defined by touching points of internal and external bisectors. Conclusion The locus formed with the internal bisectors, and the reflected point lines intersect at a single radical axis: - This establishes the concurrency of all lines mentioned. Thus, the lines AA_1, BB_1, CC_1, and the line through the incenter and excenter intersect at a single point. \`\`\`latex blacksquare \`\`\`"},{"prompt":"Given that events A, B, and C are mutually independent, if P(A cap B) = frac{1}{6}, P(overline{B} cap C) = frac{1}{8}, and P(A cap B cap overline{C}) = frac{1}{8}, find the probability of event B, P(B).","completion":"Since events A, B, and C are mutually independent, the probabilities of their intersections can be expressed by the product of their individual probabilities.

Proof using Induction: 1. **Base Case**: When n=2, we need to prove the inequality: frac{x_1}{x_2} + frac{x_2}{x_1} geq 2. Consider the expression: frac{x_1}{x_2} + frac{x_2}{x_1} - 2 = frac{x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2x_1 x_2}{x_1 x_2} = frac{(x_1 - x_2)^2}{x_1 x_2}. Since x_1 and x_2 are positive, (x_1 - x_2)^2 geq 0. Therefore, frac{(x_1 - x_2)^2}{x_1 x_2} geq 0. Thus, frac{x_1}{x_2} + frac{x_2}{x_1} geq 2. Equality holds if and only if x_1 = x_2. 2. **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume that the inequality holds for some n = k, i.e., frac{x_1}{x_2} + frac{x_2}{x_3} + ldots + frac{x_{k-1}}{x_k} + frac{x_k}{x_1} geq k. 3. **Induction Step**: For n = k + 1, consider the expression: frac{y_1}{y_2} + frac{y_2}{y_3} + ldots + frac{y_k}{y_{k+1}} + frac{y_{k+1}}{y_1}. Let's examine if there are adjacent equal elements in the sequence, say y_i = y_{i+1}. In that case: frac{y_{i-1}}{y_i} + frac{y_i}{y_{i+1}} = frac{y_{i-1}}{y_{i+1}} + 1. This transforms the sequence into: frac{y_1}{y_2} + frac{y_2}{y_3} + ldots + frac{y_{i-1}}{y_{i+1}} + 1 + frac{y_{i+1}}{y_{i+2}} + ldots + frac{y_{k+1}}{y_1}. Thus, the expression now includes one constant term (1) and k other terms, which is the same form as the left side of the inequality for n=k. By the induction hypothesis, we know this expression is at least k + 1. If there are no adjacent equal elements, you can replace any two consecutive ratios frac{y_{i-1}}{y_i} + frac{y_i}{y_{i+1}} with: frac{y_{i-1}}{y_{i}} + frac{y_{i}}{y_{i+1}} geq frac{y_{i-1}}{y_{i+1}} + 1, thanks to the base case for n=2 shown earlier. Therefore, this maintains the form of inequality which has been increased by another term, thereby still proving the left hand side sum to be at least k+1. 4. **Conclusion**: By mathematical induction, it is proven that for any positive integers x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n, the inequality holds: frac{x_1}{x_2} + frac{x_2}{x_3} + ldots + frac{x_{n-1}}{x_n} + frac{x_n}{x_1} geq n.

Denote the graphs of these trinomials as parabolas ( Gamma_{1} ) and ( Gamma_{2} ) respectively. 2. **Existence of a Translation**: The condition that the given trinomials ( f_{1}(x) ) and ( f_{2}(x) ) are quadratic means that their graphs are parabolas. There exists a unique vector ( mathbf{a} ) such that translating ( Gamma_{1} ) by this vector results in ( Gamma_{2} ).

Since it has at least two roots (the abscissas of ( A_{2} ) and ( B_{2} )), it must be identically zero. Therefore, ( f_{2}(x) equiv f_{3}(x) ) and hence ( Gamma_{3} = Gamma_{2} ). 6. **Parallelism with ( l_{1} )**: The vector ( mathbf{a} ) which was used for the translation must be parallel to the line ( l_{1} ). 7. **Intersection Points on Line ( l_{2} )**: Similarly, apply the same argument for the second line ( l_{2} ). The segments cut by the graphs on ( l_{2} ) being equal implies the translation vector ( mathbf{a} ) must also be parallel to ( l_{2} ). 8. **Conclusion on Vector ( mathbf{a} )**: Since ( mathbf{a} ) is simultaneously parallel to two non-parallel lines ( l_{1} ) and ( l_{2} ), it must be the zero vector.

There are 9 such 2 times 2 subgrids in a 6 times 6 grid (since (6/2) times (6/2) = 3 times 3): [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} hline square & square & square & square & square & square hline square & square & square & square & square & square hline square & square & square & square & square & square hline square & square & square & square & square & square hline square & square & square & square & square & square hline square & square & square & square & square & square hline end{array} ] These 9 subgrids are indicated as: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} hline 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 hline 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 hline 4 & 4 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 6 hline 4 & 4 & 5 & 5 & 6 & 6 hline 7 & 7 & 8 & 8 & 9 & 9 hline 7 & 7 & 8 & 8 & 9 & 9 hline end{array} ] 3. For each 2 times 2 subgrid, at least 2 cells must be colored to prevent the formation of any new 3-cell corner within that subgrid. [ text{Total cells to color} = 9 times 2 = 18 ] 4. To minimize the number of 3-cell corners (since each corner consists of 3 cells), the cells colored should be chosen efficiently. Namely, the minimum number of corners is achieved when each corner is placed judiciously. 5. It turns out that coloring 6 such 3-cell corners, without any overlap, suffices to cover every 2 times 2 subgrid with at least 2 colored cells. An optimal placement is as shown in the diagram (not provided here, but described below): 6. Checking the arrangement: - Each 2 times 2 subgrid includes cells from at least two of these 3-cell corners, satisfying the condition. Thus, there are no more valid places to paint another mathcal{C}. Here is how we can arrange these six mathcal{C} shapes: \`\`\` C C C C C C C - C - C - - - - - - . \`\`\` In this setup: - No new 3-cell corner can be painted - Each 2 times 2 subgrid is affected by at least 2 cells already. # Conclusion: Thus, the minimum number of 3-cell corners that need to be painted in a 6 times 6 grid so that no additional 3-cell corners can be painted is: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the mass percentage of O in CO.","completion":"To find the mass percentage of oxygen (O) in carbon monoxide (CO), we need to calculate the mass of oxygen relative to the total mass of the molecule. The molar mass of carbon (C) is approximately 12.01 g/mol, and the molar mass of oxygen (O) is approximately 16.00 g/mol. The molar mass of CO is the sum of the molar masses of C and O: Molar mass of CO = Molar mass of C + Molar mass of O Molar mass of CO = 12.01 g/mol + 16.00 g/mol Molar mass of CO = 28.01 g/mol Now, we calculate the mass percentage of oxygen in CO: Mass percentage of O = (Molar mass of O / Molar mass of CO) * 100% Mass percentage of O = (16.00 g/mol / 28.01 g/mol) * 100% Mass percentage of O ≈ (0.5712) * 100% Mass percentage of O ≈ 57.12% Therefore, the mass percentage of oxygen in carbon monoxide (CO) is approximately boxed{57.12%} ."},{"prompt":"Perform the following operation: between each pair of neighboring numbers, insert the number that results from subtracting the left number from the right number.

This is because the powers of any digit repeat every 4 cycles in the units place (by Euler's theorem or direct observation). 5.

First, we need to establish what it means for a function to be odd. A function g(x) is odd if for every x in the domain of g, g(-x) = -g(x). For a trigonometric function like f(x) to be odd, the transformation of sin(x) must preserve this property. Therefore, we begin by testing the sufficiency of the given condition: If varphi = frac{2pi}{3}, then we can substitute this into f(x) to obtain: begin{equation*} f(x) = 2sinleft(x + frac{pi}{3} + frac{2pi}{3}right) = 2sinleft(x + piright). end{equation*} Since sin(x+pi) = -sin(x), this further simplifies to: begin{equation*} f(x) = -2sin(x). end{equation*} The function -2sin(x) is indeed an odd function since for all x, we have: begin{equation*} f(-x) = -2sin(-x) = 2sin(x) = -f(x). end{equation*} This means that the condition varphi = frac{2pi}{3} is sufficient for f(x) to be an odd function. Now, let's consider the necessity. If f(x) is an odd function, then by definition, we must have: begin{equation*} f(-x) = -f(x). end{equation*} Substituting the expression for f(x) into this equation, we get: begin{equation*} 2sinleft(-x + frac{pi}{3} + varphiright) = -2sinleft(x + frac{pi}{3} + varphiright). end{equation*} Using the property that sin(-x) = -sin(x), we can rewrite the left side: begin{equation*} -2sinleft(x - frac{pi}{3} - varphiright) = -2sinleft(x + frac{pi}{3} + varphiright). end{equation*} For this to hold true for all x, we require that: begin{equation*} frac{pi}{3} + varphi = kpi, end{equation*} where k is any integer. Solving this for varphi, we get a general solution for varphi: begin{equation*} varphi = kpi - frac{pi}{3}. end{equation*} This indicates that there are an infinite number of values for varphi that will make f(x) an odd function, one of which is varphi = frac{2pi}{3} (when k = 1), but it is not the only value. Hence, the condition varphi = frac{2pi}{3} is not necessary, as there are other values of varphi that also satisfy the odd function property.

Then the last digit of ( Y ) is also not 0. 3. **Manipulating ( Y-1 ):** Considering ( Y-1 ), the digits of ( Y ) change except for the last digit. - If the sum ( X + (Y-1) = 999ldots999 ) (where all digits are 9). 4. **Digit Counting:** Notice that for each digit ( k = 0, 1, ldots, 9 ): - The number of occurrences of the digit ( k ) in ( X ) corresponds to the number of occurrences of the digit ( 9 - k ) in ( Y-1 ). 5. **Special Case Analysis:** Particularly, the occurrences of the digit ( 9-a ) in ( X ) will match with occurrences of ( a ) in ( Y-1 ), leading to: - ( 9-a = a + 1 ) - Solving the above equation: ( a = 4 ) Thus, the last digit of ( X ) must be 5. 6. **Divisibility Proof:** If ( X ) is not divisible by 50, at least one of its final two digits is not 0: - Since ( X ) ends in 5 (not 0 from previous steps), both ( X ) and ( Y ) will end in 5. 7. **Redefining ( X' ) and ( Y' ):** Define ( X' ) and ( Y' ) by removing the last digit from ( X ) and ( Y ), respectively: - We get ( X' + Y' = 999ldots999 ) with 199 nines, because removing the final digits of 10 modulo sum leaves such a pattern. 8. **Contradiction Strategy:** The sum ( 999ldots999 ) (199 nines) cannot be split into numbers formed by digit permutation of a number, as concluded in combinatorial reasoning (context to Problem 97958). - Hence, ( X' ) must be such that ( X ) is divisible by 5. 9. **Conclusion:** Since ( X ) ends in 0 or 5 naturally, and when the tens place is properly accounted: - ( X ) must not only be divisible by 10 but assuredly by 50 considering all constraints; Thus the final boxed conclusion: [ boxed{X text{ is divisible by 50}} ]"},{"prompt":"Elective 45: Special Topics on Inequalities Let the function f(x)=|2x+1||x4|.

A proportion of the form (frac{a}{b} = frac{c}{d}) can also be written more simply as ( a cdot d = b cdot c ). This implies that we have two pairs of letters where the product of the letters in each pair must be equal. 3. Let's consider the different permutations of these four letters, where each permutation results in a unique arrangement of the letters. Each arrangement can form a unique equation. For our purpose, we can treat each proportional equation as fundamentally different from its permutations if they form different groupings of products. However, we want the fundamental proportions that can be distinctly recognized as different. 4. We need to identify non-redundant (essentially different) proportions. Since we are concerned with the equality of products and not the order in which multiplication occurs, we can group the letters into pairs without considering the order of multiplication. 5. We can pair the letters in ways that result in the essential proportions: - ( xy = zt ) - ( xz = yt ) - ( xt = yz ) Each of these pairs forms a different (non-redundant) proportion since they involve different pairings of the four letters. 6. Since each unique pair splits the four letters into two pairs differently than the others, we see that we have these three unique proportions.

This is because the centroid is the average of the triangle's vertices and cannot lie on the square's perimeter if the points are non-collinear. **Step 2: Calculating the Centroid's Coordinates** The coordinates of the centroid are the average of the coordinates of the points P, Q, and R. Thus, the centroid's coordinates are of the form left(frac{m}{3}, frac{n}{3}right), where m and n are integers that satisfy 1le m,nle 29. This range ensures that the centroid lies within the square but not on its perimeter. **Step 3: Demonstrating All Possible Centroid Positions** We need to show that every point of the form left( frac{m}{3}, frac{n}{3} right), with 1 le m,n le 29, can indeed be the centroid of a triangle formed by three of our points. We do this by dividing into cases based on the ranges of m and n: - For 1 le m le 10 and 1 le n le 10, choose points (0,0), (m,0), and (0,n). - For 10 le m le 19 and 1 le n le 10, choose points (m - 10,0), (10,0), and (0,n). - For 20 le m le 29 and 1 le n le 10, choose points (m - 20,0), (10,0), and (10,n). - For 1 le m le 10 and 11 le n le 19, choose points (m,0), (0,n - 10), and (0,10). - For 10 le m le 19 and 11 le n le 19, choose points (10,0), (0,n - 10), and (m - 10,10). - For 20 le m le 29 and 11 le n le 19, choose points (m - 20,0), (10,n - 10), and (10,10). - For 1 le m le 10 and 20 le n le 29, choose points (0,n - 20), (0,10), and (m,10). - For 10 le m le 19 and 20 le n le 29, choose points (0,n - 20), (m - 10,10), and (10,10). - For 20 le m le 29 and 20 le n le 29, choose points (m - 20,10), (10,n - 20), and (10,10). By covering all possible ranges for m and n, we demonstrate that any point left( frac{m}{3}, frac{n}{3} right) within the specified range can serve as a centroid for a triangle formed by three of the given points. **Conclusion:** Since there are 29 possible values each for m and n, there are 29^2 possible positions for the centroid.

To find sin angle BAO, notice that triangle AOB is a right triangle (as AB and BC are perpendicular given it's a rectangle). Here, OB = frac{BD}{2} = frac{20}{2} = 10. The angle in question is angle BAO, with AO being the hypotenuse and AB being the opposite side for angle BAO.

The original inequality becomes: [ left(frac{b}{b-c} - 1right)^2 geq 0 ] which is evidently true. - If ( abc neq 0 ), the original inequality is equivalent to finding the smallest ( k ) such that: [ f(u, v, w) = u^2 + v^2 + w^2 - 4(u + v + w) + k geq 0 ] subject to: [ g(u, v, w) := sum uv - 4sum u + 8 = 0 ] 4. **Function Analysis**: Note that: [ u^2 + v^2 + w^2 - 4u - 4v - 4w + 8 = sum (u-2)^2 - 4 geq 0 ] for all ( u, v, w ) such that one of ( |u|, |v|, |w| geq 10^{100} ).

Thus, local minima of ( f ) must exist. 5. **Lagrange Multipliers**: To find the local minima, we use the method of Lagrange multipliers. We need to check the points ( x = (u, v, w) ) such that ( f'(x) = lambda g'(x) ) for some real number ( lambda ). 6. **Partial Derivatives**: Considering partial derivatives of ( f ) and ( g ) with respect to ( u ): [ u - 2 = lambda (-v - w + 2) ] Similarly, differentiating with respect to ( v ) and ( w ) gives: [ (u - v) = 0 quad text{if} quad lambda neq 1 ] This implies ( u = v = w ), leading to: [ u^3 = prod u = prod (u-2) = (u-2)^3 implies u = u-2 ] which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( lambda = 1 ). 7. **Summation and Simplification**: Adding the expressions: [ u - w = lambda (-v - w + 2) ] and symmetric expressions, we obtain: [ sum u = frac{6(1 + lambda)}{1 + 2lambda} = 4 ] Hence: [ g(u, v, w) = 0 implies sum uv = 4 ] Therefore: [ f(x) = (sum u)^2 - 2sum uv - 4sum u + k = 16 - 2 cdot 4 - 4 cdot 4 + 8 = 0 ] Thus, ( min f = 0 ), as desired.

From the second piece of information, we can express A in terms of B: 0.075A = 0.125B A = (0.125/0.075)B A = (5/3)B Now, using the first piece of information, we can substitute A in terms of B: (5/3)B - B = 1620 (2/3)B = 1620 B = 1620 * (3/2) B = 2430 Now that we have B, we can find A: A = (5/3)B A = (5/3) * 2430 A = 4050 Now we have A and B, we can use the third piece of information to find C: A + B = 0.5 * C^4 4050 + 2430 = 0.5 * C^4 6480 = 0.5 * C^4 C^4 = 6480 * 2 C^4 = 12960 To find C, we take the fourth root of 12960: C = (12960)^(1/4) Since we are looking for integer solutions, we need to find an integer that, when raised to the fourth power, equals 12960. The prime factorization of 12960 is: 12960 = 2^6 * 3^4 * 5 The fourth root of 12960 would then be: C = (2^6 * 3^4 * 5)^(1/4) C = 2^(6/4) * 3^(4/4) * 5^(1/4) C = 2^1.5 * 3 * 5^(0.25) Since boxed{5^(0.25)} is not an integer, there is no integer C that satisfies the condition.

Let ( n_m = p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_m ), where ( p_i ) is the ( i )-th prime number. 5. **Calculating ( s(n) ) for ( n = p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_m ):** - For ( n = p_1 cdot p_2 cdot ldots cdot p_m ), the sum of the divisors ( s(n) ) is obtained by the product: [ s(n) = (1 + p_1)(1 + p_2) cdots (1 + p_m) ] - Therefore, the ratio ( frac{s(n)}{n} ) is: [ frac{s(n)}{n} = frac{(1 + p_1)(1 + p_2) cdots (1 + p_m)}{p_1 p_2 cdots p_m} ] - Simplifying, we have: [ frac{s(n)}{n} = left(1 + frac{1}{p_1}right) left(1 + frac{1}{p_2}right) cdots left(1 + frac{1}{p_m}right) ] 6. **Analyzing the Product:** - Notice that: [ left(1 + frac{1}{p_1}right) left(1 + frac{1}{p_2}right) cdots left(1 + frac{1}{p_m}right) > 1 + frac{1}{p_1} + frac{1}{p_2} + cdots + frac{1}{p_m} ] - The right-hand side diverges because the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges. Hence, the product on the left-hand side is unbounded. 7. **Constructing the Sequence ( n_i ):** - We define a sequence ( {n_i} ) such that ( n_1 ) is the first positive integer (starting from 1), and each ( n_i ) is chosen to be the smallest integer such that ( frac{s(n_i)}{n_i} ) exceeds ( frac{s(n_{i-1})}{n_{i-1}} ). 8. **Conclusion:** - By constructing such a sequence ( {n_i} ), we ensure that each ( n_i ) has the property ( frac{s(n_i)}{n_i} > frac{s(m)}{m} ) for all ( m < n ). This sequence is infinite, hence, demonstrating that there are infinitely many ( n ) with the desired property. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Add 2_3 + 22_3 + 202_3 + 2022_3.

This implies: [ k^2 + k equiv r pmod{p} implies (2k+1)^2 equiv 4r + 1 pmod{p} ] This means that for all ( r ), there exists ( k ) such that ( (2k+1)^2 equiv 4r + 1 pmod{p} ). 5. **Complete Set of Residues**: The set of numbers of the form ( 4r + 1 ) forms a complete set of residues modulo ( p ).

Therefore, the total number of squares for this child is (frac{a}{r} times frac{b}{r} = frac{ab}{r^2}). 5. **Analyze the ratio**: Since (frac{a}{b} = frac{x}{y}), we have (a = kx) and (b = ky) for some integer (k). Thus, the number of squares along (a) is (frac{kx}{r}) and along (b) is (frac{ky}{r}). 6. **Divisibility condition**: Since (frac{kx}{r}) and (frac{ky}{r}) must be integers, (r) must divide both (kx) and (ky).

Thus, (n times m^2 xy = p). 10. **Contradiction**: Since (n > 1) and (xy > 1) (because (a neq b)), (n times m^2 xy) is a product of at least two integers greater than 1, which cannot be a prime number.

Since the purchase price has decreased by 6.4%, the current purchase price is (1 - 6.4%). Let the selling price be a, and the originally anticipated profit margin be x%. Given that the profit margin has increased by 8 percentage points, the current profit margin is (x + 8)%. We can use the formula selling price = purchase price times (1 + profit margin) to set up an equation and solve the problem. Let the original purchase price be 1. The current purchase price, after a 6.4% decrease, is 1 - 0.064 = 0.936. Let the selling price be a, and the originally anticipated profit margin be x%. The current profit margin is (x + 8)%. The selling price can be expressed in two ways: 1. Based on the original profit margin: a = 1 times (1 + frac{x}{100}) 2. Based on the current profit margin: a = 0.936 times (1 + frac{x + 8}{100}) Equating the two expressions for a gives: 1 times (1 + frac{x}{100}) = 0.936 times (1 + frac{x + 8}{100}) Solving this equation for x gives: 1 + frac{x}{100} = 0.936 + 0.936 times frac{x}{100} + 0.936 times frac{8}{100} frac{x}{100} - 0.936 times frac{x}{100} = 0.936 times frac{8}{100} - 0.064 frac{x}{100} times (1 - 0.936) = 0.07488 frac{x}{100} = frac{0.07488}{0.064} x = frac{0.07488}{0.064} times 100 x = 117 Therefore, the originally anticipated profit margin was boxed{117%}."},{"prompt":"Solve the system of equations: 1) (left{begin{array}{l}2^{x+y}=x+7 x+y=3end{array}right.) 2) (left{begin{array}{l}(m2)left(m^{2}+2right)=0 2 m+n=9 ;end{array}right.) 3) (b^{5}b^{4} k+bk=0) 4) (left{begin{array}{l}y=5[x] 1=x[y] end{array}right.)","completion":"1.

These edges do not perfectly align with one another. This misalignment causes the perception of a missing cell. Specifically, the parts are arranged in such a way that some overlap happens slightly along the boundaries; hence, parts that look like fitting perfectly, in reality, overlap just enough to compensate for the area of one cell. 4. **Accuracy of Boundary Placement**: If you were to place the external edges of each part exactly at a right angle, it would become clear that some parts overlap. This overlap causes some cells to be counted more than once and explains the root of the illusion of the missing cell. 5. **Practical Demonstration**: To better understand this, you can attempt to redraw the square and then rearrange the pieces physically or using software. Pay special attention to how the edges align and notice the overlapping regions when they are slightly mismatched. 6. **Visualization**: Refer to the provided images again. The second image demonstrates the areas where this overlap occurs, visually highlighting the misalignment. This helps in understanding that the supposed disappearance of the cell is merely a result of parts overlapping inaccurately. **Conclusion**: The disappearance of the cell is an optical illusion caused by the mismatched alignment of the pieces along their adjoining edges. Correct placement to avoid any overlap would reveal that the number of cells remains unchanged.

The general solution for when two sine functions are equal, sin A = sin B, is A = B + 2kpi or A = pi - B + 2kpi, where k is any integer. Using A = 2x-2varphi and B = 2x+frac{2pi}{3}, we find that 2x-2varphi = 2x + frac{2pi}{3} + 2kpi, simplifying to -2varphi = frac{2pi}{3} + 2kpi. 5. Solving for varphi, we get 2varphi = -frac{2pi}{3} - 2kpi, which simplifies further to varphi = -kpi - frac{pi}{3}. 6. Given that varphi > 0 and by selecting k=-1, we find varphi = pi - frac{pi}{3} = frac{2pi}{3}.

This rotation will affect how we view the relationships between the white and black cells. Specifically, the middle portion is a (1984 times 1983) grid. Each white cell is filled with either 1 or -1 initially. 3. **Construction of an Extended Grid:** To facilitate our proof, we extend the grid by adding two additional columns on the left and right sides.

Let's examine this further with specifics. 5. **Adjacency Conditions and Implications:** - By setting up the product condition systematically by looping through each black cell and multiplying adjacent white cell values, we can establish a continuous constraint. - This extended grid helps us maintain the product condition uniformly even with the newly added columns. 6. **Mathematical Induction over the Rows and Columns:** We can use induction to show that changing any white value to -1 leads to contradiction. - **Base Case:** Assume initially, all cells in the newly added columns are filled with 1. - **Inductive Step:** For each black cell in the grid, the product of adjacent white cells is assumed to be 1. This necessitates that changing any singular cell breaks this uniformity immediately. 7. **Proof by Contradiction:** - Assuming at least one white cell contains -1 leads us into a contradiction as it disrupts the given constraint. - Since placing a -1 breaks the condition (product of adjacent white cells being 1), the supposed presence of -1 anywhere forces impossible adjustments in adjacent cells causing an infinite loop of contradictory configuration adjustments. 8. **Conclusion:** - Hence, all cells must indeed uniformly be 1 to satisfy the product requirement based on our assumptions and further calculations. - Therefore, all numbers in the white cells must be 1.

This can be expressed as: [ (ab)^2 = ac cdot bc quad (2) ] Additionally, we are given the sum: [ a + b + c = 6 quad (3) ] Now from equation (1), solve for b: [ b = frac{a+c}{2} quad (4) ] Substitute equation (4) into equation (3): [ a + frac{a+c}{2} + c = 6 ] [ 2a + a + c + 2c = 12 ] [ 3a + 3c = 12 ] [ a + c = 4 quad (5) ] Now use equation (5) to replace a+c in equation (2): [ (ab)^2 = a cdot ac ] [ (ab)^2 = (a+c) cdot ab ] [ (ab)^2 = 4 cdot ab ] [ ab = 4 ] Since a and c are symmetric in the original set of equations, it means that if a is a solution, then c will be a solution too. We just need to find the value of one variable. From the arithmetic sequence relationship and the sum a + c = 4, we get: [ c = 4 - a ] Substituting b from equation (4) and c into the expression ab=4, we have: [ a cdot frac{a+(4-a)}{2} = 4 ] [ frac{a^2 + 4a - a^2}{2} = 4 ] [ 2a = 8 ] [ a = 4 ] Therefore, we have two possible solutions for a due to the symmetry: a=4 and c=4-a=0, which cannot be the case since a, b, and c are distinct real numbers. Thus, we must switch their roles: Let's examine when a=0 and c=4 instead. Revisiting the sum: [ a + b + c = 0 + b + 4 = 6 ] [ b = 2 ] Substitute this into the geometric sequence relationship: [ (0 cdot 2)^2 = (0 cdot 4)(2 cdot 4) ] [ 0 = 32 cdot 0 ] This is also not possible since b neq 0 based on the arithmetic sequence; therefore, we made an error while factoring incorrectly in the initial steps. We should retake from the equation (ab)^2 = 4 cdot ab. If ab neq 0: [ ab = 4 ] [ a = frac{4}{b} ] Substituting frac{4}{b} for a into a + c = 4: [ frac{4}{b} + c = 4 ] [ c = 4 - frac{4}{b} ] Substitute a and c from above into ac = 4: [ left( frac{4}{b} right) left( 4 - frac{4}{b} right) = 4 ] [ 16 - frac{16}{b^2} = 4b ] [ 16 - 4b = frac{16}{b^2} ] Now multiply through by b^2: [ 16b^2 - 4b^3 = 16 ] [ b^3 - 4b^2 + 4 = 0 ] Factoring out b^2: [ b^2(b - 4) + 4 = 0 ] Now there can be two possible solutions, but since b cannot be 0, we take b - 4 = 0, yielding b = 4. Substituting back into equation (3) to solve for a and c: [ a + 4 + c = 6 ] [ a + c = 2 ] The last substitution into equation (1): [ a + c = 2 ] [ 2 cdot 4 = a + c ] [ 8 = a + c ] There is an inconsistency here since our derived value for a + c was 2 previously. Re-examine the steps before, correcting the error in factoring the cubic equation, which should yield: [ b^3 - 4b^2 + 4b = 0 ] [ b(b^2 - 4b + 4) = 0 ] [ b(b-2)^2 = 0 ] Since b neq 0, we have b = 2. Substituting back into equation (4): [ a + 2 + c = 6 ] [ a + c = 4 ] [ 2 cdot 2 = a + c ] [ 4 = a + c ] Now, recall equation (1), 2b = a+c: [ 2 cdot 2 = a + c ] [ a + c = 4 ] We can see that when b=2, the value holds consistent with a+c=4. Now we can find a or c since we know the sum of the two: [ a = 4 - c ] Substituting a back into equation (2): [ (4 cdot b)^2 = (4-c) cdot cb ] [ (4 cdot 2)^2 = (4-c)c cdot 2 ] [ 16 cdot 4 = (4-c)c cdot 2 ] [ 64 = 2 cdot 4c - 2c^2 ] [ 0 = 2c^2 - 8c + 64 ] Now simplify and divide by 2: [ c^2 - 4c + 32 = 0 ] This doesn't have real solutions, so we must have made another algebraic mistake. Let's go back to the correct cubic factoring equation: [ b(b - 2)^2 = 0 ] Since b neq 0, we have: [ (b - 2)^2 = 0 ] [ b - 2 = 0 ] [ b = 2 ] With b=2, we go back to the sum of the arithmetic series and substitute b into equation (3): [ a + 2 + c = 6 ] [ a + c = 4 ] We already had this sum and knew that the sum of a and c is 4, which means we can't determine one uniquely without the other; we need another equation. So let's use the geometric sequence property equation (2) and substitution from (5): [ (ab)^2 = ac cdot bc ] [ a cdot c cdot b^2 = ac cdot bc ] [ b^2 = bc ] If b = 2, we have: [ 4 = 2c ] [ c = 2 ] Now knowing c=2, we can find a: [ a + c = 4 ] [ a + 2 = 4 ] [ a = 2 ] However, this cannot be correct either, as a, b, and c are distinct. Re-evaluate the steps. Let’s go back and revisit the geometric sequence equation (2) with the correct b: [ (ab)^2 = ac cdot bc ] [ left(frac{4}{b} cdot bright)^2 = left(4 - frac{4}{b}right) cdot b cdot 2 ] [ 16 = left(4b - 4right) cdot 2 ] [ 16 = 8b - 8 ] [ 8 + 16 = 8b ] [ 24 = 8b ] [ b = 3 ] So b=3. Now let’s substitute b = 3 back into the sum of the arithmetic sequence: [ a + 3 + c = 6 ] [ a + c = 3 ] Considering we previously deduced that 2b=a+c, we end up having: [ 2 cdot 3 = a + c ] [ 6 = a + c ] Now that makes sense. With b=3 and a+c=6, substitute into equation (1): [ 2 cdot 3 = a + c ] [ 6 = a + c ] So we have a + c = 6 and b = 3. Return to the property of the geometric sequence with the correct b: [ (ab)^2 = ac cdot bc ] [ (a cdot 3)^2 = a cdot c cdot 3 cdot 3 ] [ 9a^2 = 9ac ] [ a^2 = ac ] Since a neq c, we eliminate a = 0: [ a = c ] But because we're told that a, b, and c are distinct, then a cannot equal c. We know that a + c = 6, and since a neq c, a and c must be 2 and 4 in some order. If a = 2, then c=6-2=4, which would not satisfy the geometric condition because (2 cdot 4)^2 neq 2 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 3. Therefore, a must be 4, and c must be 2.

Therefore, ( G ) must include some odd numbers. Suppose we replace some ( k ) even numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k ) in ( G ) with their complementary odd numbers ( 201 - a_1, 201 - a_2, ldots, 201 - a_k ).

Therefore, angle MON = 180^circ - angle MCN. - Since MC and CN are segments of sides of the square ABCD and M and N are inner points, angle MCN = 90^circ. - Hence, angle MON = 180^circ - 90^circ = 90^circ. 4. **Calculate Distance**: - Let the radius of circle omega be denoted as R. - We calculate the distances OM and ON: OM = 2R sin 45^circ. Since sin 45^circ = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we have: OM = 2R cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} = Rsqrt{2}. - Similarly, ON = Rsqrt{2}. 5. **Equal Distance Verification**: - Since OM = ON = Rsqrt{2}, it follows that O is equidistant from M and N. - Therefore, O must be the circumcentre of the triangle AMN because it is equidistant from at least two vertices of the triangle. 6. **Confirm Circle Through A**: - To further verify O is the circumcentre, since angle MAN = 45^circ, - We know that the angle subtended by the arc overarc{MN} at the centre O of the circle is twice the angle subtended at the circumference at point A: angle MON = 2 times angle MAN = 2 times 45^circ = 90^circ. - This matches the previously calculated angle MON = 90^circ. 7. **Conclusion**: - Since O is equidistant from M and N and correctly subtends angle MON, - O indeed lies on diagonal AC and is the circumcentre of triangle AMN.

We must have: [ frac{P(a) - P(b)}{a - b} in mathbb{Z} ] Substituting ( P(a) = frac{2008}{a} ) and ( P(b) = frac{2008}{b} ), we get: [ frac{frac{2008}{a} - frac{2008}{b}}{a - b} = frac{2008(b - a)}{ab(a - b)} = frac{2008}{ab} in mathbb{Z} ] This implies that for any distinct divisors ( a ) and ( b ) of 2008, ( ab ) must also be a divisor of 2008. 4. **Check if ( ab ) is a divisor of 2008 for all pairs of divisors:** - For ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 2 ), ( ab = 2 ), which is a divisor. - For ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 4 ), ( ab = 4 ), which is a divisor. - For ( a = 2 ) and ( b = 4 ), ( ab = 8 ), which is a divisor. - For ( a = 2 ) and ( b = 251 ), ( ab = 502 ), which is a divisor. - For ( a = 4 ) and ( b = 251 ), ( ab = 1004 ), which is a divisor. - For ( a = 8 ) and ( b = 251 ), ( ab = 2008 ), which is a divisor.

For these values, ( ab = n ), which is a divisor of ( n ). - If ( n = 1 ), its only divisor is 1, and the condition is trivially satisfied.

This strategy ensures that the magician can identify the five additional coins in their correct state, even though the assistant cannot communicate directly to the magician when he enters. 3. **Step 3: Divide the Problem into Smaller Parts** - Divide the 27 coins into 9 groups of 3 coins each (a triplet). [ 27 text{ coins} = 9 times 3 text{ triplets} ] 4. **Step 4: Analyze the Distribution of Coin States Within Triplets** - In each triplet, there will be a mixture of heads and tails. Different combinations are possible, but the assistant will determine the state of each triplet: - More heads than tails - More tails than heads - Without loss of generality, let's assume each triplet state as predominantly heads or tails. 5. **Step 5: The Assistant Covers All But Five Coins Strategically** - Let’s say out of the nine triplets, five have more heads than tails (arbitrary choice, it could be tails as well). The assistant will then leave one coin uncovered from each of these five triplets which predominantly show heads. - Example configuration where heads dominate: - ( {H, H, T} ) - covering any of (H,H) - ( {H, T, H} ) - covering any of (H,H) - and so on for five triplets. 6. **Step 6: The Determined Communication** - The trick lies in how the assistant decides which specific coin in each triplet to leave uncovered: - Define a rule. For instance, if the leftmost two coins in a triplet are heads, the assistant uncovers the left coin. This specific pattern will inform the magician about the positioning of heads within that triplet. - Possible rules for assistant: - Two leftmost heads: uncover the leftmost coin. - Two rightmost heads: uncover the middle coin. - Left and right heads: uncover the rightmost coin. - These rules allow the magician to infer the specific hidden heads coins in the other triplets based on the position of the uncovered coin. 7. **Step 7: The Magician’s Task** - When the magician enters, he sees the five uncovered coins and remembers the agreed pattern. - With the predetermined pattern, the magician deciphers the exact combination of heads positions in each triplet and thus guesses correctly which other five coins (still covered) will show heads. # Conclusion This combination and hidden message deciphering complete the focus trick successfully.

Thus, ( t geq 26 ). 2. **Assuming a Coloring Scheme**: - Suppose we have a coloring such that any set of 26 consecutive points contains at most two colors. 3. **Points Distribution**: - We'll now analyze the distribution of points more closely given the conditions: - For any coloring to satisfy our requirement, consider P_{1}, P_{2}, ldots, P_{100}, ensuring at least 26 consecutive points must contain at least three colors. 4. **Selecting Maximum Subscript Points**: - Let (x_i) represent the largest index of a point colored with color i for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. - Assume (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) such that (x_2 < x_3 < x_4 < x_5). 5. **Points Non-inclusion of All Five Colors**: - Assume (P_{k + 1}, P_{k + 2}, ldots, P_{100}) excludes one color, say color 1. - Consequently, both (P_1) and (P_k) are colored 1 by maximality. 6. **Setting Lower Bound Using Gaps**: - Utilizing the cyclic nature, we evaluate the gaps between these maximum subscripts: - Show that gaps (x_i - x_{i-1} geq 25), where (x_0 = x_5 = 100). 7. **Considering Consecutive Points**: - With 26 consecutive points explored (P_{x_{i-1}}, P_{x_{i-1} + 1}, ldots, P_{x_{i-1} + 25}): - Prove that such points must contain at least 3 colors due to the nature of gaps and distribution. 8. **Derive a Contradiction**: - Since the total length based on our gap assumption exceeds the available indices (101 > x_5 = 100), this provides a contradiction. 9. **Conclusion**: - Thus, the assumption that there are coloring patterns where 26 consecutive points have less than 3 colors breaks. - Therefore, for any valid coloring satisfying the problem conditions, at least 26 consecutive points must contain at least three different colors.

For any other point ( Q ), by Pick's Theorem, ( 2[QBC] ) is an integer, say ( n ). Thus, ( Q ) lies on the line through ( n cdot mathbf{v} ), parallel to line ( BC ). Since ( mathbf{w} ) is a minimal length lattice vector along this direction, ( vec{Q} - n mathbf{v} ) is an integer multiple of ( mathbf{w} ). 6. **Main Problem:** - By Pick's Theorem, the area of ( triangle ABC ) is ( frac{9}{2} ). Thus, ( A = 9 mathbf{v} + k mathbf{w} ) for some integer ( k ). - For ( ABC ) to contain ( P ) in its interior, ( 0 < k < 9 ). Therefore, there are eight possible values for ( k ) to check. 7. **Checking Values of ( k ):** - If ( k equiv 0 pmod{3} ), line ( AC ) contains the lattice point ( 3 mathbf{v} + frac{k}{3} mathbf{w} ), which is a contradiction. - If ( k equiv 2 pmod{3} ), line ( BC ) contains the lattice point ( 3 mathbf{v} + frac{k+1}{3} mathbf{w} ), which is a contradiction. - Therefore, the remaining values to check are ( k = 1, 4, 7 ). 8. **Handling Remaining Cases:** - If ( k = 1 ), ( triangle ABC ) contains the four collinear lattice points ( mathbf{v} ), ( 2mathbf{v} ), ( 3mathbf{v} ), ( 4mathbf{v} ). - If ( k = 4 ), ( triangle ABC ) contains the four collinear lattice points ( mathbf{v} ), ( 3mathbf{v} + mathbf{w} ), ( 5mathbf{v} + 2mathbf{w} ), ( 7mathbf{v} + 3mathbf{w} ). - If ( k = 7 ), ( triangle ABC ) contains the four collinear lattice points ( mathbf{v} ), ( 2mathbf{v} + mathbf{w} ), ( 3mathbf{v} + 2mathbf{w} ), ( 4mathbf{v} + 3mathbf{w} ).

These ( |X_0| ) polygons have a total area of ( |X_0| ). - The union of the areas of the polygons from the second sheet that intersect any polygon in ( X_0 ) is at least ( |X_0| ) because each intersecting polygon must cover at least a part of every polygon in ( X_0 ). - Thus, the number of polygons from the second sheet that intersect polygons in ( X_0 ) is at least ( |X_0| ). 5. **Apply Hall's Condition:** - Since for any subset ( X_0 ) of polygons from the first sheet, there are at least ( |X_0| ) intersecting polygons from the second sheet, the conditions of Hall's Marriage Theorem are satisfied. - Therefore, there exists a perfect matching between the ( 2019^2 ) polygons of the first sheet and the ( 2019^2 ) polygons of the second sheet. 6. **Conclusion:** - For each matched pair of polygons, choose any point of intersection where to place a pin. - This ensures that each of the ( 2019^2 ) polygons on both sheets will be perforated. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"What is the smallest threedigit palindrome divisible by 11?","completion":"- The property of palindromes and the smallest three-digit palindrome starts from 101. text{Divide } 101 text{ by } 11: quad 101 div 11 = 9 text{ remainder } 2 This means 11*9 = 99 and adding another 11 gives 110, which is not a palindrome. - Check successive palindromes (111, 121, 131, ...) to find the smallest one divisible by 11. 111 div 11 = 10 quad text{remainder } 1 121 div 11 = 11 quad text{remainder } 0 121 is divisible by 11 cleanly and it's a palindrome. - Therefore, boxed{121} is the smallest three-digit palindrome divisible by 11."},{"prompt":"The diagram shows a gokart track layout.

Since (p) is a prime number, (p) must be 2 (the only even prime). Thus, we have: [ frac{2^2 + 2q}{q + r} = frac{4 + 2q}{q + r} = frac{2(q + 2)}{q + r} ] For this to be an integer, (q + r) must divide (2(q + 2)). Since (q + r) is even, let (q + r = 2k). Then: [ 2k mid 2(q + 2) implies k mid q + 2 ] Thus, (q + r = 2k) divides (q + 2), implying: [ 2k leq q + 2 implies k leq frac{q + 2}{2} ] Since (k) is an integer, (k) must be a divisor of (q + 2). We now consider the possible values of (q) and (r). Subcase 1.1: (r = 2) If (r = 2), then (q) must be even (since (q + r) is even). The only even prime is 2, so (q = 2).

The possible values for (r - 2) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Since (r) is a prime number greater than 2, the only possible value is (r = 7). This gives (q = 7 - 4 = 3). Thus, the triple is ((2, 3, 7)).

Substituting into the third condition: [ frac{3p + 4}{p + q} < 3 ] This implies: [ 3p + 4 < 3(p + q) implies 4 < 3q implies q > frac{4}{3} ] Since (q) is an odd prime, the smallest value is (q = 3). This gives (p = 2), resulting in the triple ((2, 3, 2)). However, substituting into the second condition: [ frac{3^2 + 9 cdot 2}{2 + 2} = frac{9 + 18}{4} = frac{27}{4} = 6.75 ] which is not an integer. Thus, (r neq 2). Subcase 2.2: (q = 2) If (q = 2), then (r) must be odd. Substituting into the second condition: [ p + r mid 9r + 4 ] Since (9r + 4) is odd, (p + r) must be odd, implying (p) is even. Thus, (p = 2).

The possible values for (r + 2) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Since (r) is a prime number greater than 2, the only possible value is (r = 7).

Simplifying the denominator: [ (1 + bc) + (1 + ca) + (1 + ab) = 3 + ab + bc + ca ] Given that (ab + bc + ca = 3), we substitute this into the denominator: [ 3 + ab + bc + ca = 3 + 3 = 6 ] Hence: [ frac{(a+b+c)^2}{6} ] 5. Therefore: [ frac{a^2}{1+bc} + frac{b^2}{1+ca} + frac{c^2}{1+ab} geq frac{(a+b+c)^2}{6} ] 6. Next, we use the AM-GM inequality on (a, b, c): [ a + b + c geq 3 sqrt[3]{abc} ] Since (a, b, c) are positive and also (ab + bc + ca = 3), it follows that the arithmetic mean of (a, b, c) is at least the cube root of their product: [ a + b + c geq 3 ] Squaring both sides yields: [ (a + b + c)^2 geq 9 ] 7. Therefore: [ frac{(a+b+c)^2}{6} geq frac{9}{6} = frac{3}{2} ] 8.

Given that A is an interior angle of the triangle, we conclude that A = frac{2pi}{3}. The area of triangle ABC can be calculated using the formula S = frac{1}{2}bcsin A.

Step-by-Step Process: 1. **Verification by Example:** We are provided an example where the polygon can be divided into (24) triangles. ![Illustration of Division](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_f68ab0b4ba9161e79ed2g-03.jpg?height=632&width=640&top_left_y=1622&top_left_x=709) 2. **General Proof for Any (n)-gon:** - First, consider an (n)-gon where (n) stands for the number of vertices. - Assume it's possible to divide the polygon into (T) number of triangles such that from each interior vertex (if any) at least 6 segments emanate. 3. **Coloring Strategy:** - Color the vertices of the (n)-gon blue and all the interior points (vertices of triangles not on the boundary) red. - Color the triangles as follows: - Blue triangles are those that have at least one blue vertex. - Red triangles are those with no blue vertices (only from interior vertices). 4. **Calculating Blue Triangles:** - Each interior vertex must have angles summing to (360^circ), implying that the sum of angles around any red vertex is less than (60^circ) on average. - Since the average angle for the triangles around red vertices combined with the traditional properties of the interior angles of a triangle, there shouldn't be an excess of red angles. 5. **Bounding Blue Triangles via Angle Analysis:** - Segments from a single red vertex interact with fewer than (60^circ) angles. Summing angles up, this translates to fewer than (3(n - 2) - n = 2n - 6) blue triangles. 6. **Red Triangles Portion:** - If there are (2n - 6) blue triangles, then the sections that aren’t colored yet (potentially multiple polygons), will collectively have fewer than (n - 6) sides. 7. **Calculating Interior Triangles & Completing the Proof:** - Consider the left-behind parts of the polygon. Each stage deduces via segments that fewer sides perpetuate (macroscopically). - Logically moving to completion, one ultimately aggregates a maximum division where the condition achieves (2n - 6 + 6 = n + 12). 8. **Final Assessment for n = 12:** - Summing blue triangles and remaining undivided parts’ bounds, it's affirmed the complex can't split further beyond (24). - Through verifying higher fractions iteratively via added conditions meeting lanterns rules, any boundary (optimally for (12)-sided figures) must conform to concluded fraction limits. Conclusion: Thus, the maximum number of triangular sections that can be made while satisfying the given conditions is: [ boxed{24} ]"},{"prompt":"the first quarter, Vasya had 5 grades in math, with most of them being A's (assuming A corresponds to a 5). The median of all the grades was 4, and the arithmetic mean was 3.8. What grades could Vasya have received?","completion":"1. **Arrange the grades in ascending order** We are given that Vasya had 5 grades in total, and the median grade is 4. Therefore, when arranged in ascending order, the third (middle) grade must be 4. This gives us the initial arrangement: [ (_, _, 4, _, _) ] 2. **Determine the rightmost grades** Since it's provided that there are more 5's than any other grade, we start considering the possibilities for the grades greater than or equal to 4. The two grades positioned after the median (4) must satisfy this condition. The possible pairs for these two grades on the right are: [ (4,4), (4,5), (5,5) ] However, the pairs (4,4) or (4,5) would result in an equal or lesser number of 5's compared to 4's, which contradicts the problem's condition that 5's are the most frequent. Therefore, the last two grades must be: [ (5,5) ] Thus, the arrangement now is: [ (_, _, 4, 5, 5) ] 3. **Calculate the required sum of all grades** The arithmetic mean of all the grades is given as 3.8. With 5 grades, the sum of all grades can be computed using: [ 3.8 times 5 = 19 ] Given the last two grades and the middle grade: [ 4 + 5 + 5 = 14 ] Therefore, the sum of the first two grades must be: [ 19 - 14 = 5 ] 4. **Identify the possible values for the first two grades** The first two grades must sum to 5. The possible pairs (with each grade between 1 and 5) could be: [ (1,4), (2,3) ] However, the pair (1,4) would make the count of 4's and 5's equal, again contradicting the given conditions.

We are given that R = Rs. 30. The housewife can obtain 4 kgs more oil for Rs. 600 due to the reduction in price. This means that with the original price, she would have obtained (600/P) kgs of oil, and with the reduced price, she obtains (600/R) kgs of oil. The difference in the quantity of oil obtained due to the price reduction is 4 kgs. Therefore, we can write the equation: (600/R) - (600/P) = 4 We know that R = 30, so we can substitute this into the equation: (600/30) - (600/P) = 4 20 - (600/P) = 4 600/P = 20 - 4 600/P = 16 Now we can solve for P: P = 600/16 P = 37.5 So the original price per kg of oil was Rs. 37.5. Now we can calculate the percentage reduction in the price of oil: Percentage reduction = ((Original Price - Reduced Price) / Original Price) * 100 Percentage reduction = ((37.5 - 30) / 37.5) * 100 Percentage reduction = (7.5 / 37.5) * 100 Percentage reduction = 0.2 * 100 Percentage reduction = 20% Therefore, the percentage reduction in the price of oil is boxed{20%} ."},{"prompt":"Given the function f(x) = ln(e^x + k), where k is a constant and e is the base of the natural logarithm, it is known that the function is an odd function on the set of real numbers mathbb{R}.

Substitute a+b=2 into the inequality, resulting in ableqslant 1. 4. Now, let's examine the expression for {a}^{2}+{b}^{2}. We can rewrite it as {a}^{2}+{b}^{2}={left(a+bright)}^{2}-2ab. 5. Substitute a+b=2 and ableqslant 1 into the equation. We obtain {a}^{2}+{b}^{2}geqslant {2}^{2}-2times1=2. Thus, the correct option is C: boxed{{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}geqslant 2}."},{"prompt":"One hour after Yolanda started walking from X to Y, a distance of 40 miles, Bob started walking along the same road from Y to X. Yolanda's walking rate was 2 miles per hour. When they met, Bob had walked 25.333333333333332 miles. What was Bob's walking rate?","completion":"Let's denote Bob's walking rate as B miles per hour. Yolanda started walking 1 hour before Bob, so by the time Bob started, Yolanda had already walked 2 miles (since her walking rate is 2 miles per hour). When they meet, Yolanda has walked for T+1 hours (where T is the time Bob has walked), and Bob has walked for T hours. The distance Yolanda has walked when they meet is 2(T+1) miles, and the distance Bob has walked is 25.333333333333332 miles. Since they meet, the sum of the distances they have walked is equal to the total distance between X and Y, which is 40 miles. So we have the equation: 2(T+1) + 25.333333333333332 = 40 Solving for T: 2T + 2 + 25.333333333333332 = 40 2T + 27.333333333333332 = 40 2T = 40 - 27.333333333333332 2T = 12.666666666666668 T = 12.666666666666668 / 2 T = 6.333333333333334 Now we know that Bob has walked 25.333333333333332 miles in T hours, which is 6.333333333333334 hours. To find Bob's walking rate B, we divide the distance he walked by the time he walked: B = 25.333333333333332 miles / 6.333333333333334 hours B ≈ 4 miles per hour So, Bob's walking rate is approximately boxed{4} miles per hour."},{"prompt":"Determine the value of x for which the expression frac{3x^3 + 5}{x^2 16x + 64} is undefined.","completion":"The expression frac{3x^3 + 5}{x^2 - 16x + 64} is undefined when the denominator is zero.

Since M gives a remainder of 10 when divided by 11, M+1 must be divisible by 11. Similarly, we deduce that M+1 must also be divisible by 12, 13, and 14. Therefore, the least possible value for M+1 is the least common multiple (LCM) of 11, 12, 13, and 14. The prime factorizations of these numbers are 11, (2^2cdot3), 13, and (2cdot7), respectively. The LCM of these numbers, taking the highest powers of all prime factors, is (2^2cdot3cdot7cdot11cdot13 = 30030). Therefore, the least possible value for M is M+1 - 1 = 30030 - 1 = 30029.

The sales of Cafeteria A increased month by month, with each monthly increment being the same; the sales of Cafeteria B also increased month by month, with the percentage increase being the same each month. It is known that in September 2013, the sales of the two cafeterias were equal again. Which cafeteria had higher sales in May 2013? A: Cafeteria A B: Cafeteria B C: The sales of Cafeterias A and B were equal D: Cannot be determined","completion":"Let's denote the sales in January 2013 for both cafeterias as S. Since Cafeteria A's sales increase by a constant amount each month, let a be the monthly increase. Therefore, the sales of Cafeteria A in the n-th month can be expressed as S + (n - 1)a. For Cafeteria B, which increases by a constant percentage each month, let's denote this percentage as p%. Thus, the monthly sales in the n-th month for Cafeteria B can be written as S(1 + p)^{n-1}. According to the problem, in September (the 9th month), the sales are equal again: S + (9 - 1)a = S(1 + p)^{8} Sa + 8a = S(1 + p)^{8} Since the sales were also equal in January (the 1st month), we can conclude that: S = Sa Now we can look at May (the 5th month). The sales for Cafeteria A and B would be: - For Cafeteria A: S + (5 - 1)a = S + 4a - For Cafeteria B: S(1 + p)^{4} To determine which cafeteria had higher sales, we need to compare S + 4a with S(1 + p)^{4}. Since both sides started from the same initial sales S and their sales equal again in September, there must have been a point between January and September where sales of both intersected, and possibly crossed over. Given that the sales are equal only in January and September, we can infer that before this crossover point, the one with arithmetic growth had higher sales and after the crossover, the one with geometric growth had higher sales because geometric growth accelerates over time. Since May is before September, Cafeteria A, with the arithmetic growth, must have had the higher sales in May: S + 4a > S(1 + p)^{4} Therefore, the answer is: boxed{text{A: Cafeteria A}}"},{"prompt":"Vaishali has 4 hats, each with three stripes.
