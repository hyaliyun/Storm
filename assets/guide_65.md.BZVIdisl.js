Is the set of natural number solutions finite or infinite?","completion":"To determine if the natural number solutions (x, y,) and (z) of the equation (x^3 + y^4 = z^5) form a finite or infinite set, we proceed as follows: 1. We begin by verifying that there exists at least one set of solutions that satisfies (x^3 + y^4 = z^5): [ 2^{24} + 2^{24} = 2^{25} ] This can be verified by directly calculating each term: [ 2^{24} + 2^{24} = 2 times 2^{24} = 2^{25} ] Thus, ( 2^{24} + 2^{24} = 2^{25} ). 2. Recognizing (2^{8}, 2^{6},) and (2^{5}) as the cube, fourth power, and fifth root respectively, we express the above identity in terms of powers. [ left(2^{8}right)^3 + left(2^{6}right)^4 = left(2^{5}right)^5 ] When equated: [ left(2^{8}right)^3 + left(2^{6}right)^4 = left(2^{5}right)^5 ] We get: [ left(256right)^3 + left(64right)^4 = left(32right)^5 ] Hence: [ left(256right)^3 = 2^{24}, quad left(64right)^4 = 2^{24}, quad left(32right)^5 = 2^{25} ] Thus, we have: [ (256)^{3} + (64)^{4} = (32)^{5} ] Therefore: [ left{ begin{array}{l} x = 2^{8} = 256, y = 2^{6} = 64, z = 2^{5} = 32 end{array} right. ] This confirms the existence of one solution set ( (x, y, z) = (256, 64, 32) ). 3. Consider another set of solutions in general form. Assume (left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}right)) is one solution: [ x_0^3 + y_0^4 = z_0^5 ] For any integer (k), the following manipulations remain in the form required by the original equation: [ left{ begin{array}{l} x = k^{20} x_0, y = k^{15} y_0, z = k^{12} z_0 end{array} right. ] Explanation: [ (k^{20} x_0)^3 + (k^{15} y_0)^4 = k^{60} x_0^3 + k^{60} y_0^4 = k^{60} (x_0^3 + y_0^4) = k^{60} z_0^5 = (k^{12} z_0)^5 ] 4. Thus, for any integer (k), [ (k^{20} x_0)^3 + (k^{15} y_0)^4 = (k^{12} z_0)^5 ] is a valid solution. 5.

Since triangle MNF forms a right-angled triangle, the distance from the focus F to the points M and N (which are on the hyperbola) is the same as the distance from the focus to the vertex of the parabola (which is p), so we have: p= sqrt {6+ frac{p^{2}}{4}}.

If a large bottle of the sport formulation contains 2 ounces of corn syrup, how many ounces of water does it contain?","completion":"Let's first determine the ratios for the standard formulation. The ratio of flavoring to corn syrup to water is 1:12:30. This means for every 1 part of flavoring, there are 12 parts of corn syrup and 30 parts of water. In the sport formulation, the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is three times as great. So if the standard ratio is 1:12, the sport ratio for flavoring to corn syrup would be 3:12, which simplifies to 1:4. The ratio of flavoring to water in the sport formulation is half that of the standard formulation. The standard ratio of flavoring to water is 1:30, so the sport ratio would be 1:60. Now we have the ratios for the sport formulation: - Flavoring to corn syrup: 1:4 - Flavoring to water: 1:60 Since we know the sport formulation contains 2 ounces of corn syrup, we can use the flavoring to corn syrup ratio to find out how much flavoring there is. For every 4 parts of corn syrup, there is 1 part of flavoring. So if 4 parts equal 2 ounces, then 1 part (the flavoring) would be 2 ounces / 4 = 0.5 ounces. Now we can use the flavoring to water ratio to find out how much water there is. For every 1 part of flavoring, there are 60 parts of water. Since we have 0.5 ounces of flavoring, we would have 0.5 ounces * 60 = 30 ounces of water.

For the checkered fabric: She spent 75 and it cost 7.50 per yard, so she bought 75 / 7.50 = 10 yards of checkered fabric. For the plain fabric: She spent 45 and it cost 6 per yard, so she bought 45 / 6 = 7.5 yards of plain fabric. For the striped fabric: She spent 63 and it cost 9 per yard, so she bought 63 / 9 = 7 yards of striped fabric. Now, let's calculate the total amount she spent on the polka dot fabric. We know she spent a total of 250 on all fabrics, so the amount spent on polka dot fabric is 250 - (75 + 45 + 63) = 250 - 183 = 67. Since the polka dot fabric cost 4.50 per yard with a 10% discount for purchasing 10 or more yards, let's first find out the price per yard after the discount. The discount is 10% of 4.50, which is 4.50 * 0.10 = 0.45. So, the discounted price per yard is 4.50 - 0.45 = 4.05.

However, the question states that she needs 210 pounds of meat in a week, not 350 pounds. So, we will use the 210 pounds figure for our calculations.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown: 1. Start with gcd(7979, 3713). 2. Calculate 7979 mod 3713 = 553. This is because 7979 - 2 cdot 3713 = 553. So, gcd(7979, 3713) = gcd(3713, 553). 3. Next, calculate 3713 mod 553 = 395. This happens because 3713 - 6 cdot 553 = 395. Thus, gcd(3713, 553) = gcd(553, 395). 4. Then, calculate 553 mod 395 = 158. This is because 553 - 395 = 158.

Let ( j ) of them be trees, and ( k ) of them be components with at least as many edges as vertices. Call the latter group good components. Let ( E ) be the set of edges of ( G ). - For each of the ( k ) good components, use Lemma 1 to remove edges from these components until all of them are Sun Graphs (Lemma 2). Call the new graph ( H ), and the set of edges we removed as ( F ). - Let the sizes of the central cycles of the good components be ( c_i ). If two of the ( c_i ) are equal we are done. Otherwise, suppose ( c_1 < c_2 < ldots < c_k ). - Let the corresponding sizes of the good components be ( s_i ). It is clear that ( c_i le s_i ). Also ( c_1 ge 3 ) and ( c_i ge c_{i-1} + 1 ). Thus, [ 3 + 4 + ldots + (k+2) le sum c_i le sum s_i le n ] - This implies that ( k ) is at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ). - We have [ (text{sum of sizes of tree components} - j) + |F| + (text{sum of sizes of good components}) = |E| ge (1+epsilon)n ] - Notice that [ n = (text{sum of sizes of tree components}) + (text{sum of sizes of good components}) ] - Thus ( |F| ge epsilon n + j ge epsilon n ). 4. **Adding Back Edges:** - Now let us start adding back edges of ( F ) back into ( H ) to eventually return to ( G ). If we add an edge ( e ) with endpoints ( a, b ), such that ( a, b ) are in the same tree of some sun graph, then we call edge ( e ) bad. We will try to add as many bad edges back into the graph until we run out. - Suppose we add a bad edge with endpoints ( a_0, b_0 ) to get ( H' ). Now suppose we have an edge with endpoints ( a_1, b_1 ), such that ( a_1, b_1 ) are part of the same tree of ( H ). If this tree is different from that of ( a_0, b_0 ) we are fine and just add. But if it is the same tree as ( a_0, b_0 ), is it bad? Each time we add an edge we modify the graph. Notice when we added ( a_0, b_0 ), the tree it was in became a sun graph of its own. So now we redefine badness as in if ( a_1, b_1 ) need to be in the same tree of a sun graph, which may or may not be a sub-component of a larger good component. But notice then that if ( a_1, b_1 ) is bad and lies in a tree of the sun graph formed by ( a_0, b_0 ), it may form an even deeper sun graph component. This is fine. - So whenever we have a bad edge, we will add it to the graph, and we continue doing this until we reach a state ( S ) where there do not exist any more bad edges we can add by our above definition. Then let us add the remaining edges in any order. I claim you will never encounter another bad edge. If you do, then you could've added this edge right after ( S ), which contradicts the maximality of the state ( S ) where you cannot add any more bad edges. - Notice that by our definition of badness, the cycles induced by adding bad edges are pairwise disjoint and also different from the original central cycles of the good components. They also intersect previous cycles in at most one vertex. 5. **Counting Cycles:** - Let ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_m ) be the cycle lengths of the union of the set of cycles induced by bad edges and the set of original central cycles. If two of the ( d ) are the same, we are done. Else, [ 3 le d_1 < d_2 < ldots < d_m ] - and ( d_i ge d_{i-1} + 1 ). During the course of adding bad edges, suppose the number of times a new cycle intersected an older cycle in 1 vertex was ( p ), we have ( 0 le p le m ). Then, [ 3 + 4 + ldots + (m+2) le sum d_i le n + p le n + m ] - Thus we get ( m ) is at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ). Thus there are at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ) different cycles and at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ) bad edges. So the number of non-bad edges is (ge O(epsilon n) - O(sqrt{n})). Choose ( n ) sufficiently large so that ( O(epsilon n) ) dominates ( O(sqrt{n}) ). Thus we assume we have ( O(epsilon n) ) non-bad edges. 6. **Final Argument:** - Let the graph after we add bad edges and before we add non-bad edges be ( I ). Now consider the non-bad edges. Let us consider a non-bad edge ( c, d ). Consider the shortest path from ( c ) to ( d ) in ( I ). It clearly must intersect one of the cycles in at least 1 edge otherwise ( c, d ) would be bad. Of the cycle(s) it intersects, consider the shallowest cycle. Recall that whenever we added bad edges, we would create a new cycle that would be more deeply layered in the graph. Like for example let the original central cycles of the graph have level 0, then if ( a_0, b_0 ) is bad it would create a cycle of level 1, then if ( a_1, b_1 ) is bad and it lies in one of the trees of the sun graph induced by ( a_0, b_0 ) then the cycle induced by ( a_1, b_1 ) would have layer 2, etc. The shallowest cycle for ( c, d ) would be the cycle with level ( k ) where ( k ) is minimal among all cycles ( c, d ) intersects. This cycle is also unique because to travel between two cycles of the same level you would need to pass through a cycle of smaller level. Notice we also choose the shortest path from ( c ) to ( d ) in ( I ) (since there are potentially several different non self-intersecting paths from ( c ) to ( d )) to prevent the path from doing irrelevant stuff. Let us associate this shallowest cycle with each non-bad edge. - Let the number of cycles be ( q ), and for each cycle let ( r_i ) be the number of non-bad edges associated with that cycle. If ( s ) is the number of non-bad edges, we have [ sum_{i=1}^q r_i = s ] - Now consider two edges ( a, b ) and ( c, d ) with the same associated cycle. Let ( C ) refer to this cycle. I claim that you can construct a cycle using these two edges, and the other edges are edges of ( I ). This is some simple casework (I recommend you draw a diagram for this). - **Case 1:** The set of trees that ( a, b, c, d ) is part of has size 2. - Since ( a, b ) and ( c, d ) are non-bad edges, WLOG we have ( a ) and ( c ) in the same tree, and ( b ) and ( d ) in the same tree. Then the cycle is (path from ( a ) to ( c )) + (edge ( c, d )) + (path from ( d ) to ( b )) + (edge ( b, a )). - **Case 2:** The set of trees that ( a, b, c, d ) is part of has size 3. - WLOG ( a, c ) share a tree and ( b ) and ( d ) are in their own separate trees. Then the cycle will be (path from ( a ) to ( c )) + (edge ( c, d )) + (path from ( d ) to ( b )) + (edge ( b, a )). A potential issue we might run into is if path from ( d ) to ( b ) intersects path from ( a ) to ( c ) at some vertex on ( C ). However, notice then that for the part of the path from ( d ) to ( b ) that lies on ( C ), you can take the other direction on the cycle and avoid this vertex. So in this case you can generate a valid cycle. - **Case 3:** The set of trees that ( a, b, c, d ) are part of has size 4. Consider the corresponding trees ( t(a), t(b), t(c), t(d) ) that the vertices are part of. WLOG we only need to consider these two subcases: - **Case 3a:** In clockwise order wrt ( C ) come ( t(a), t(b), t(c), t(d) ). Then the cycle should be (edge ( a, b )) + (path from ( b ) to ( c )) + (edge ( c, d )) + (path from ( d ) to ( a )). Clearly the path from ( b ) to ( c ) and the path from ( d ) to ( a ) do not intersect if for path from ( b ) to ( c ) the path it travels on ( C ) is clockwise, and similarly for path from ( d ) to ( a ). - **Case 3b:** In clockwise order wrt ( C ) come ( t(a), t(c), t(b), t(d) ). From ( a ) take the edge to ( b ), then travel to ( c ), making sure that when traveling on ( C ) you take the clockwise route, then go to ( d ) via the edge, then travel to ( a ), making sure that when traveling on ( C ) you take the clockwise route. - Thus in all cases, for a pair of non-bad edges you may construct a cycle. Moreover, these cycles constructed by different pairs are pairwise distinct, since each cycle is only composed of edges from ( I ) except for two unique pair of edges that are from the set of non-bad edges. - Thus the number of cycles in the graph by adding back all the non-bad edges is at least [ sum_{i=1}^q {r_i choose 2} ge q{frac{sum r_i}{q} choose 2} = qleft(frac{left(frac{s}{q}right)left(frac{s}{q}-1right)}{2}right) = left(frac{s}{2}right)left(frac{s}{q}-1right) ] - Notice that ( s ) is ( O(epsilon n) ) by taking ( n ) sufficiently large. ( q ) is at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ). Thus this expression is at least something like ( O(epsilon^2 n sqrt{n}) ), and for ( n ) sufficiently large, this dominates ( O(n) ). Thus for ( n ) sufficiently large this is strictly greater than ( n ). Since cycle lengths can only be between 3 and ( n ) inclusive for a graph with ( n ) vertices, by pigeonhole two of the cycles in the graph must have the same length. - (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Calculate the following summation: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} (i+j+k), ] where k=5 is a constant. textbf{(A) }2{,}000{,}000 qquad textbf{(B) }2{,}100{,}000qquad textbf{(C) }2{,}300{,}000 qquad textbf{(D) }2{,}529{,}000 qquad textbf{(E) }2{,}700{,}000","completion":"We begin by analyzing the given double summation: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} (i+j+5). ] We can simplify this as: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} i + sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} j + sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} 5. ] Since i and j are constant in their respective inner sums and k=5 is a constant: [ 120sum^{150}_{i=1} i + 150sum^{120}_{j=1} j + 150 times 120 times 5. ] We use the summation formula sum^{n}_{k=1} k = frac{n(n+1)}{2}: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} i = frac{150 times 151}{2} = 11325, quad sum^{120}_{j=1} j = frac{120 times 121}{2} = 7260. ] Substituting back, we get: [ 120 times 11325 + 150 times 7260 + 150 times 120 times 5. ] Calculating further: [ 1359000 + 1089000 + 90000 = 2529000. ] Therefore, the answer to the problem is: [ 2,529,000. ] The final answer is boxed{textbf{(D) }2{,}529{,}000}"},{"prompt":"f the graph of the function f(x)=sin(2x+varphi) (0 < varphi < pi) is shifted to the right by frac{π}{3} units and the resulting graph corresponds to an odd function, then varphi =______.","completion":"To solve the problem, we start with the given function f(x)=sin(2x+varphi), where 0 < varphi < pi.

Moreover, because the point (3,4) lies on one of the asymptotes of the hyperbola, we can use the slope of the line connecting this point to the origin to deduce the ratio dfrac{b}{a}. For the asymptote in the form y = dfrac{b}{a}x, this gives us dfrac{b}{a} = dfrac{4}{3}. With the two equations: begin{align*} a^2 + b^2 &= 25 quad text{(1)} dfrac{b}{a} &= dfrac{4}{3} quad text{(2)} end{align*} We can solve them simultaneously. From equation (2), we get b = dfrac{4}{3}a.

Substituting a back into equation (2) to find b, we get b = dfrac{4}{3} cdot 3 = 4.

This product (q) is the product of all elements in the subset (A). 3. **Pigeonhole principle**: Among the integers (2^0 - 3, 2^1 - 3, ldots, 2^q - 3), there must be at least two integers, say (2^i - 3) and (2^j - 3) (with (0 leq j < i leq q)), that give the same residue when divided by (q). This is due to the pigeonhole principle, as there are (q+1) numbers and only (q) possible residues modulo (q). 4. **Residue condition**: Since (2^i - 3 equiv 2^j - 3 pmod{q}), it follows that (q mid (2^i - 2^j)).

Consequently, (2^{i-j} - 3) is relatively prime to each element of (A) because (2^{a_l} - 3 < q leq 2^{i-j} - 1). 6. **Contradiction**: This implies that there exists an integer (m = i - j) such that (2^m - 3) is relatively prime to every element in (A). This contradicts our assumption that (A) was a subset of maximal size, as we have found another element (2^m - 3) that can be added to (A) while maintaining the property that every two members are relatively prime. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our initial assumption that all such subsets are finite must be false.

Next, we rewrite the left-hand side: [ frac{1}{p + 1} - frac{1}{q} = frac{q - (p + 1)}{q(p + 1)} = frac{q - p - 1}{q(p + 1)} ] Therefore, we have: [ frac{q - p - 1}{q(p + 1)} = frac{4}{n + 2} ] 3. Since the left-hand side is positive, we must have: [ q - p - 1 > 0 implies q > p + 1 ] 4. We claim that the left-hand side of the equation is in its lowest form. To show this, we need to prove that: [ gcd(q - p - 1, q) = gcd(q - p - 1, p + 1) = 1 ] By the Euclidean algorithm, we have: [ gcd(q - p - 1, q) = gcd(q - p - 1, p + 1) ] Suppose (gcd(p + 1, q) = d neq 1). Since (d mid q) and (q) is prime, we must have (d = q). Therefore, (q mid (p + 1)), which implies (q leq p + 1). This contradicts (q > p + 1). Hence, (gcd(p + 1, q) = 1). 5. Since the left-hand side is in its lowest form, we have: [ 4 = k(q - p - 1) quad text{and} quad n + 2 = kq(p + 1) ] for some integer (k). This implies: [ q - p - 1 mid 4 ] 6. The divisors of 4 are 1, 2, and 4. Therefore, we have: [ q - p - 1 = 1, 2, 4 ] which yields: [ q - p = 2, 3, 5 ] 7.

Next, identify which digit in the repeating sequence corresponds to the 2021st digit after the decimal point. Since the period contains 6 digits, we can determine the position of the 2021st digit by finding the remainder when 2021 is divided by 6: [ 2021 div 6 = 336 text{remainder} 5 ] This tells us that the 2021st digit corresponds to the 5th digit in the repeating sequence (142857). 3. From the repeating sequence (142857), we see that the 5th digit is (5). 4. Now, consider the effect of crossing out this digit. By removing the digit (5) and essentially replacing it with nothing (i.e., moving subsequent digits up one place), we alter the number. However, to analyze the change we look at the place value. In the repeating sequence, after removing the digit (5) from the 2021st position, we'll shift subsequent digits. Thus effectively the digit in that position after deletion will be the next digit from another cycle of the period, which is (1). 5.

According to the information given: - John has 15 snakes. - He has 5 fewer lions than monkeys, so L = M - 5. - He has 8 more pandas than lions, so P = L + 8. - He has 1/3 as many dogs as pandas, so D = P / 3. The total number of animals is 114, so we can write the equation: 15 (snakes) + M (monkeys) + L (lions) + P (pandas) + D (dogs) = 114 Substituting L, P, and D with the expressions in terms of M, we get: 15 + M + (M - 5) + (M - 5 + 8) + (M - 5 + 8) / 3 = 114 Simplifying the equation: 15 + M + M - 5 + M - 5 + 8 + (M - 5 + 8) / 3 = 114 15 + 3M - 2 + (M + 3) / 3 = 114 3M + 13 + (M + 3) / 3 = 114 Multiplying the entire equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 9M + 39 + M + 3 = 342 10M + 42 = 342 Subtracting 42 from both sides, we get: 10M = 300 Dividing both sides by 10, we get: M = 30 So, John has 30 monkeys. Now, we need to find the ratio of the number of monkeys to the number of snakes: Monkeys : Snakes = 30 : 15 Simplifying the ratio by dividing both numbers by 15, we get: Monkeys : Snakes = 2 : 1 Therefore, the ratio of the number of monkeys to the number of snakes is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"A man buys 120 pens at the marked price of 100 pens from a wholesaler. If he sells these pens giving a discount of 2%, what is the profit percent?","completion":"Let's assume the marked price of each pen is 1. The man buys 120 pens at the price of 100 pens, so he effectively pays 100 for 120 pens. The cost price for each pen for the man is therefore 100/120 = 5/6 per pen. When he sells these pens, he gives a discount of 2% on the marked price. So, he sells each pen at 98% of the marked price. The selling price for each pen is therefore 98% of 1 = 0.98. The profit for each pen is the selling price minus the cost price, which is 0.98 - 5/6. To subtract these, we need a common denominator, which is 6. So we convert 0.98 to a fraction with a denominator of 6. 0.98 = 98/100 = 49/50 To get the denominator to 6, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 6/5. 49/50 * 6/5 = 294/250 = 1.176 Now we have a common denominator: Profit per pen = 1.176 - 5/6 To subtract these, we need to convert 5/6 to a decimal with the same denominator as 1.176, which is 250. 5/6 = 5 * 250/6 * 250 = 1250/1500 = 0.833 Now we can subtract: Profit per pen = 1.176 - 0.833 = 0.343 The profit percent is the profit per pen divided by the cost price per pen, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Profit percent = (0.343 / 5/6) * 100 To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: Profit percent = (0.343 * 6/5) * 100 Profit percent = (2.058) * 100 Profit percent = 205.8% So the profit percent is boxed{205.8%} ."},{"prompt":"triangle triangle ABC, the lengths of the sides opposite the internal angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Thus, tan A > tanfrac{pi}{6} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. This implies: [ 0 < frac{sqrt{3}}{2tan A} < frac{3}{2} ] Therefore, frac{c}{a} in (frac{1}{2}, 2).

Zhang Liang from Class 83 scored 78 points. Provide him with reasonable suggestions to improve his physical fitness level.","completion":"1. To find the values of a, b, c, and d, we analyze the given data: - The number of students with scores between 90 and 100 is given as 30% of 40 students, which is 0.3 times 40 = 12. Therefore, a = 12. - For b, since 8 out of 40 students fall in the range of 60 to 74, and we know that 20% of 40 is 8 (because 0.2 times 40 = 8), it follows that b = 20. - To find the median c, we first sort the scores in ascending order. The sorted scores are: 54, 56, 57, 59, 63, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 79, 79, 80, 81, 81, 83, 83, 83, 83, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93, 94, 95, 95, 96, 98. The median is the average of the 20^{th} and 21^{st} scores, which are 81 and 83. Thus, c = frac{81 + 83}{2} = 82. - The mode d is the score that appears most frequently. Since 83 appears four times, more than any other score, d = 83. Therefore, the values are a = 12, b = 20, c = 82, and d = 83. So, we have boxed{a = 12}, boxed{b = 20}, boxed{c = 82}, and boxed{d = 83}. 2. To estimate how many students have scores between 75 and 100 in the entire eighth grade of 800 students, we first find the total number of students in the sample who scored in this range, which is 16 + 12 = 28. Since these 28 students represent 40 + 30 = 70% of the sample of 40 students, we can estimate the same percentage for the entire grade. Thus, 70% of 800 students is 0.7 times 800 = 560 students. Therefore, approximately boxed{560} students in the eighth grade have scores between 75 and 100. 3. For Zhang Liang, who scored 78 points, the recommendation is to actively participate in physical fitness enhancement training programs.

(II) The derivative of the function is f'(x)=frac{a}{x}+(a+1)x=frac{(a+1)x^2+a}{x} (x > 0). When a=-1, f'(x)=-frac{1}{x} < 0. Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty). When aneq -1, Delta =-4a(a+1). From Delta leqslant 0, we have ageqslant 0 or a < -1. When ageqslant 0, f'(x) > 0. Therefore, the function f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). When a < -1, f'(x) < 0. Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty). When -1 < a < 0, we have Delta > 0 and frac{-a}{a+1} > 0. The derivative can be written as f'(x)=frac{(a+1)(x+sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}})(x-sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}})}{x}. Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on (0, sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}) and increasing on [sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}, +infty). In summary, the function f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty) when aleqslant -1, increasing on (0, +infty) when ageqslant 0, and decreasing on (0, sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}) and increasing on [sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}, +infty) when -1 < a < 0. (III) When -1 < a < 0, the function f(x) reaches its minimum value at x=sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}. We have f(sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}})=frac{a}{2}ln{frac{-a}{a+1}}-frac{a}{2}+1. Since f(x) > 1+frac{a}{2}ln (-a) always holds for any x > 0, we have frac{a}{2}ln{frac{-a}{a+1}}-frac{a}{2}+1 > 1+frac{a}{2}ln (-a), which simplifies to ln (a+1) > -1. Given -1 < a < 0, we have frac{1}{e}-1 < a < 0. Therefore, the range of a is (frac{1}{e}-1, 0)."},{"prompt":"A cycle is bought for some amount and sold for Rs. 1350 with a gain of 50%.

We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. First, we'll multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of ( J ) the same: [ 3(3J + 2S) = 3 times 69 ] [ 2(2J + 3S) = 2 times 71 ] This gives us: [ 9J + 6S = 207 ] [ 4J + 6S = 142 ] Now, we'll subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate ( S ): [ (9J + 6S) - (4J + 6S) = 207 - 142 ] [ 5J = 65 ] Divide both sides by 5 to find the cost of one pair of jeans: [ J = 65 / 5 ] [ J = 13 ] Now that we know the cost of one pair of jeans, we can substitute ( J = 13 ) into either of the original equations to find ( S ).

By the nature of tangents, the line segments AO_1, BO_1, CO_2, and DO_2 are all perpendicular to their respective tangents at points of tangency. 2. **Symmetry and Right Angles:** - Let P be the point where the common tangents intersect. - Due to symmetry, PO_1 is perpendicular to AB and PO_2 is perpendicular to CD. 3. **Right Angle between PO_1 and PO_2:** - PO_1 and PO_2 are both lines through P connecting to the centers of their respective circles, hence forming a right angle with each other (since internal and external tangents create perpendicular bisectors). 4. **Formation of a Rectangle:** - Points A, B, C, and D give hints of forming a rectangle due to the perpendicularity mentioned. - Consequently, (AB) is perpendicular to (CD) as AB and CD are both sides of the hypothetical rectangle formed by the lines through A, B, C, and D. 5. **Intersection Points as Circle Diameters:** - Consider the circle of diameter [AC] and the circle of diameter [BD]. - The lines AC and BD intersect precisely at the centers of these circles and their respective diameters cross each other orthogonally. 6. **Radical Axis Argument:** - Let’s make use of the radical axis theorem which states that the locus of points having equal power with respect to both circles lies on the radical axis. - For any point on the line left(O_1O_2right) including the centers O_1 and O_2, the power with respect to the circle of diameter [AC] equals the power with respect to the circle of diameter [BD]. - Specifically, O_1 lies on the radical axis because the power of O_1 with respect to the circle of diameter [AC] is O_1A^2, matching O_1B^2 with respect to the circle of diameter [BD]. - Similarly, O_2 lies on the same radical axis. 7. **Conclusion:** - Since the points O_1 and O_2 both lie on this radical axis, which is the line left(O_1 O_2right), and considering the intersection properties of these lines through A, B, C, D, the intersecting point of (AB) and (CD) must lie on left(O_1 O_2right).

Since the cube is divided into 216 identical cubelets, and 216 is the cube of 6 (6 x 6 x 6 = 216), we can infer that the original cube was divided into 6 cubelets along each edge. Now, let's consider the painting of the cube. Each set of opposite faces is painted with a different color. When the cube is cut into cubelets, the only cubelets that will have exactly one face painted are those that are not on an edge or corner (because edge cubelets will have two painted faces and corner cubelets will have three painted faces). On each face, there will be a 4x4 square of cubelets that have only one face painted (since the outermost layer of cubelets on each face will be edge cubelets). Since there are two opposite faces for each color, the number of cubelets with exactly one face painted for each color will be 4 x 4 x 2 = 32. Given that there are 96 cubelets painted with exactly one color, and we know that each color contributes 32 such cubelets, we can conclude that all three colors (the first set, red, and blue) are painted on opposite faces of the cube.

Determine the values of m and n for which, by placing the token in some square, all the squares of the board will have been occupied in the end of the game.","completion":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to determine the values of ( m ) and ( n ) for which it is possible to move a token on an ( m times n ) board such that all squares are visited exactly once, following the given movement rules. 2. **Hamiltonian Path:** The problem essentially asks for a Hamiltonian path on an ( m times n ) grid, where the path must follow the additional constraints that no two consecutive moves are in the same direction and no square is visited more than once. 3. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1: ( m = 1 ) or ( n = 1 ):** If either ( m ) or ( n ) is 1, the board is a single row or column. The token can simply move from one end to the other, visiting all squares. This is trivially a Hamiltonian path. - If ( m = 1 ), ( n ) can be any positive integer. - If ( n = 1 ), ( m ) can be any positive integer. - **Case 2: ( m = 2 ) or ( n = 2 ):** If either ( m ) or ( n ) is 2, the board is two rows or two columns. We can start at one corner and zigzag through the board, ensuring that no two consecutive moves are in the same direction. - If ( m = 2 ), ( n ) can be any positive integer. - If ( n = 2 ), ( m ) can be any positive integer. - **Case 3: ( m > 2 ) and ( n > 2 ):** If both ( m ) and ( n ) are greater than 2, we need to check if a Hamiltonian path is possible. Consider the following: - A Hamiltonian path must visit all squares exactly once. - The path must change direction at every move. - If the path enters a corner, it must exit through a different side, which forces a revisit of a square due to the constraints. This leads to a contradiction because the path cannot continue without revisiting a square or breaking the direction change rule. Therefore, a Hamiltonian path is not possible for ( m > 2 ) and ( n > 2 ). 4. **Conclusion:** The only possible values for ( m ) and ( n ) that allow the token to visit all squares exactly once, following the given movement rules, are: - ( 1 times 1 ) - ( 2 times N ) for any ( N geq 1 ) - ( N times 2 ) for any ( N geq 1 ) The final answer is ( boxed{ 1 times 1 } ), ( 2 times N ) for any ( N geq 1 ), and ( N times 2 ) for any ( N geq 1 )."},{"prompt":"find large number from below question the difference of two numbers is 1395 . on dividing the larger number by the smaller , we get 6 as quotient and the 15 as remainder","completion":"Let's call the larger number L and the smaller number S.

The task is to determine if this figure can be divided into five triangles and then reassembled into a square. 2. **Determining the area of the figure**: To check if it's possible to rearrange the triangles into a square, we first need to know the area of the initial figure.

Since our goal is to form a square, we need to make sure these triangles can be rearranged to fit perfectly into a square shape. A key insight here is that the hypotenuses of these triangles will form the sides of the square. By carefully placing each triangle, aligning their hypotenuses and ensuring the square's area matches the sum of the triangles' areas, we reach our goal.

Given the solution set, the vertex of the parabola, which is given by -frac{b}{2a}, must be halfway between the two points of the solution set, i.e., between -2 and 3. Therefore, the x-coordinate of the vertex is frac{-2+3}{2}=frac{1}{2}. Substituting this into the vertex formula gives us -frac{b}{2a}=frac{1}{2}. Solving for b in terms of a yields b = -a. 3.

Therefore, we actually have a^{2} > b^{2}, and thus option A is incorrect. **Option B**: a^{2} < ab Given that a and b are negative, ab will be positive and a^2 will also be positive.

Normally, sin x has a range of [-1,1], but multiplying by 2 stretches the range to [-2,2]. However, since our given range is [-1,2], it means we are looking at specific portions of the sine curve where it attains these values. 2. **Determining the Maximum b-a**: To achieve the maximum range of [-1,2], we need to consider the interval of x over which sin x goes from -1/2 to 1. This occurs from x = -frac{pi}{6} (where sin x = -1/2) to x = frac{7pi}{6} (where sin x = -1/2 again, completing a full cycle of necessary values).

Starting with a_{1}=2, we calculate the next few terms to identify a pattern: - For a_{2}, we have a_{2} = 1 - frac{1}{a_{1}} = 1 - frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2}. - For a_{3}, we proceed with a_{3} = 1 - frac{1}{a_{2}} = 1 - frac{1}{frac{1}{2}} = 1 - 2 = -1. - For a_{4}, we find a_{4} = 1 - frac{1}{a_{3}} = 1 - frac{1}{-1} = 1 - (-1) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Given this cyclical pattern, we can determine the value of a_{2023} by understanding its position in the cycle. Since the cycle repeats every 3 numbers, we divide 2023 by 3 to find its position in the cycle: - 2023 div 3 = 674 remainder 1.

First, consider the case when ( k = 1 ): [ A(1, a, b) = frac{a + b}{a^2 + b^2 - ab} ] 4. We will show that ( A(1, a, b) leq 2 ): - For ( a = b ): [ A(1, a, a) = frac{2a}{a^2} = frac{2}{a} ] Since ( a ) is a positive integer, ( frac{2}{a} leq 2 ). - Without loss of generality, assume ( a < b ): [ A(1, a, b) = frac{a + b}{a^2 + b^2 - ab} ] We need to show that this expression is less than or equal to 1: [ A(1, a, b) = frac{a + b}{a^2 + b(b - a)} ] Since ( b > a ), we have: [ a^2 + b(b - a) = a^2 + b^2 - ab geq a^2 + b - a ] Therefore: [ A(1, a, b) leq frac{a + b}{a + b} = 1 ] 5.

To proceed, we need to count the total number of unit squares (cells) that make up the figure. 2. **Count the Number of Cells**: - By counting, we observe that the figure consists of 18 unit squares. 3. **Concept of Rearrangement**: - To transform this figure into a square, we should understand that the area of the figure must be preserved. - A square with the same area as the given figure would need an area of 18 unit squares. 4. **Determine the Side of the Square**: - The area (A) of the square is given by the formula (A = s^2), where (s) is the side length of the square. - We set (s^2 = 18) and solve for (s): [ s = sqrt{18} approx 4.24 ] - Since (s) should be an integer to form an exact square on the grid and no integer (s) satisfies (s^2 = 18), forming a perfect square directly is impossible without considering partial cells.

The population decreases annually, so after one year, the population would be 8000 * (1 - r/100), and after two years, it would be 8000 * (1 - r/100)^2. According to the information given, the population after two years is 6480. So we can set up the equation: 8000 * (1 - r/100)^2 = 6480 Now we need to solve for r. First, let's divide both sides by 8000 to simplify the equation: (1 - r/100)^2 = 6480 / 8000 Now let's calculate the right side: (1 - r/100)^2 = 0.81 Next, we take the square root of both sides to get rid of the square: 1 - r/100 = sqrt(0.81) 1 - r/100 = 0.9 Now, we solve for r: -r/100 = 0.9 - 1 -r/100 = -0.1 Multiply both sides by 100 to get r: r = -0.1 * 100 r = -10 The negative sign indicates a decrease, so the annual rate of decrease in population is boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"Find all solutions to the inequality [ sqrt[3]{x} + frac{3}{sqrt[3]{x} + 4} + 1 le 0, ] giving your answer in interval notation.","completion":"First, we make the substitution ( y = sqrt[3]{x} ), so that our inequality becomes [ y + frac{3}{y+4} + 1 le 0. ] Combining the terms on the left-hand side under a common denominator, we get [ frac{y^2 + 4y + 3 + y + 4}{y+4} le 0, ] which simplifies to [ frac{y^2 + 5y + 7}{y + 4} le 0. ] Factoring the numerator if possible: [ y^2 + 5y + 7 = (y + a)(y + b) ] Using formula for roots, we find no real roots for ( y^2 + 5y + 7 = 0 ) as the discriminant ( 5^2 - 4 times 1 times 7 = 25 - 28 = -3 ) is negative. Therefore, the quadratic does not factor over the reals, and no ( y ) makes the numerator zero.

In this case, the winning candidate won by a majority of 250 votes. Let's denote the number of votes received by the second candidate as S. Then the winning candidate received S + 250 votes. According to the information given, the winning candidate received 55% of the total valid votes, so we have: S + 250 = 0.55V We don't have information about the third candidate, but we know that the total votes received by all three candidates must equal the total number of valid votes, V. Therefore: S + (S + 250) + Third Candidate's Votes = V Since the winning candidate received 55% of the votes, the remaining 45% of the votes must have been split between the second and third candidates. Therefore: S + (S + 250) = 0.45V Now we have two expressions for the votes received by the second candidate: 1. S + 250 = 0.55V 2. 2S + 250 = 0.45V We can solve for S using the first equation: S = 0.55V - 250 Substitute this value of S into the second equation: 2(0.55V - 250) + 250 = 0.45V 1.1V - 500 + 250 = 0.45V 1.1V - 0.45V = 500 - 250 0.65V = 250 Now, solve for V: V = 250 / 0.65 V = 384.6154 (approximately) Since the number of votes must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number: V ≈ 385 Therefore, the total number of valid votes cast in this election is approximately boxed{385} ."},{"prompt":"Which of the following values is largest? textbf{(A) }3+1+2+8qquadtextbf{(B) }3 times 1 + 2 + 8qquadtextbf{(C) }3+1 times 2 + 8qquadtextbf{(D) }3+1+2 times 8qquadtextbf{(E) }3 times 1 times 2 times 8 textbf{(A) }14qquadtextbf{(B) }13qquadtextbf{(C) }13qquadtextbf{(D) }20qquadtextbf{(E) }48","completion":"1. **Expression A:** 3 + 1 + 2 + 8 - Using commutative and associative properties of addition: - 3 + 1 = 4 - 4 + 2 = 6 - 6 + 8 = 14 - Thus, 3 + 1 + 2 + 8 = 14. 2. **Expression B:** 3 times 1 + 2 + 8 - Perform multiplication before addition: - 3 times 1 = 3 - 3 + 2 = 5 - 5 + 8 = 13 - Thus, 3 times 1 + 2 + 8 = 13. 3. **Expression C:** 3 + 1 times 2 + 8 - Perform multiplication before addition: - 1 times 2 = 2 - 3 + 2 = 5 - 5 + 8 = 13 - Thus, 3 + 1 times 2 + 8 = 13. 4. **Expression D:** 3 + 1 + 2 times 8 - Perform multiplication before addition: - 2 times 8 = 16 - 3 + 1 = 4 - 4 + 16 = 20 - Thus, 3 + 1 + 2 times 8 = 20. 5. **Expression E:** 3 times 1 times 2 times 8 - Using associative and commutative properties of multiplication: - 3 times 1 = 3 - 3 times 2 = 6 - 6 times 8 = 48 - Thus, 3 times 1 times 2 times 8 = 48.

Then, starting from some term (a), all subsequent terms must be prime numbers. 2. **Digit Appending Restrictions**: We know that appending certain digits to any number will result in a composite number. Specifically: - Appending an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) will yield a composite number because the resulting number will be even. - Appending digit 5 will yield a composite number (unless the resulting number is 5 itself, which is a rare and specific case). Consequently, the only non-9 digits available for appending to maintain primality are 1 and 7. 3. **Classify Based on Remainder Modulo 3**: - Let ( a equiv 3k + r , (text{mod} , 3) ), where ( r in {0, 1, 2} ). 4. **Case Analysis on Modulo 3 Remainders**: - If ( a equiv 0 , (text{mod} ,3) ): Appending any non-9 digit to (a) will either maintain the divisibility by 3 or produce a composite number, as the appended digit won't affect the divisibility condition in a beneficial way. - If ( a equiv 1 , (text{mod} ,3) ) or ( a equiv 2 , (text{mod} ,3) ): - Appending 1 or 7 will alter the remainder: [ begin{cases} a equiv 1 (text{mod} ,3) rightarrow text{Appending 1:} , a' equiv 2 (text{mod} ,3) , text{or Appending 7:} , a' equiv 0 (text{mod} ,3) a equiv 2 (text{mod} ,3) rightarrow text{Appending 1:} , a' equiv 0 (text{mod} ,3) , text{or Appending 7:} , a' equiv 1 (text{mod} ,3) end{cases} ] - Hence, if initially (a) has ( a equiv 1 , (text{mod} ,3)), after appending one 1 or 7, a multiple of 3 will be obtained (composite number). Similarly for ( a equiv 2 , (text{mod} ,3) ). 5. **Forced Digit Addition**: - Eventually, every number fits into an aforementioned case, and the sequence cannot perpetually avoid producing a multiple of 3, hence a composite number from a prime number ( p ). 6. **Final Characteristic**: - Therefore, for any initial (a_1), after several steps, appending digits 1 or 7 will necessarily produce a composite number. 7. **Conclusion**: Since it is impossible to keep every term in the sequence prime by continuously appending non-9 digits, we inevitably produce at least two composite numbers in the infinite sequence.

This effectively reduces our problem to arranging four entities (the combined house-car key entity and the three other keys) on a keychain. 1. **Combining the House and Car Key**: We treat the house key and car key as one entity. This is because their arrangement relative to each other does not change the overall arrangement due to the nature of the keychain (it can be rotated and reflected). 2. **Arranging the Entities on the Keychain**: Now, we have four entities to arrange. However, since this is a keychain, the arrangement is circular, and the order only matters relative to each other. For linear arrangements, we would have 4! ways to arrange four items. But in a circular arrangement, one of the positions can be fixed to remove the rotations being counted as different arrangements.

Pipe R can fill the tank in 18 hours, so its rate is 1/18 of the tank per hour. When all pipes are open, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates: Total rate = Rate of P + Rate of Q + Rate of R Total rate = (1/3) + (1/9) + (1/18) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 18 in this case: Total rate = (6/18) + (2/18) + (1/18) Total rate = (6 + 2 + 1) / 18 Total rate = 9/18 Total rate = 1/2 (simplified) This means that when all pipes are open, they fill half of the tank in one hour.

We want to cut out the filled rectangle from the paper using four straight cuts.

How to achieve this goal, and what is that minimized length? Show the correct cuts and write the final answer. There is no need to prove the answer. *Proposed by Morteza Saghafian*","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal way to cut out the 10 times 5 rectangle from the 40 times 30 paper using four straight cuts such that the total length of the cuts is minimized. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this: 1. **Identify the Position of the Filled Rectangle:** Let's assume the 10 times 5 rectangle is positioned such that its bottom-left corner is at coordinates (x_1, y_1) and its top-right corner is at coordinates (x_2, y_2). Therefore, x_2 = x_1 + 10 and y_2 = y_1 + 5. 2. **Determine the Cuts:** To cut out the filled rectangle, we need to make four cuts: - Two vertical cuts to isolate the left and right sides of the rectangle. - Two horizontal cuts to isolate the top and bottom sides of the rectangle. 3. **Calculate the Length of Each Cut:** - The first vertical cut will be at x_1 and will span the height of the paper, which is 30 units. - The second vertical cut will be at x_2 and will also span the height of the paper, which is 30 units. - The first horizontal cut will be at y_1 and will span the width of the paper, which is 40 units. - The second horizontal cut will be at y_2 and will also span the width of the paper, which is 40 units. 4. **Sum the Lengths of the Cuts:** The total length of the cuts is the sum of the lengths of the four cuts: [ text{Total Length} = 30 + 30 + 40 + 40 = 140 ] 5. **Verify the Optimality:** Since each cut spans the entire dimension of the paper (either height or width), and we are making the minimum number of cuts (four), this configuration is optimal.

The equation of line l is given by mx-y-3m+4=0. This line passes through a fixed point M(3,4). 2. The circle O has its center at the origin (0,0) and a radius of 2, which means its equation is x^2+y^2=4. 3. The distance d from the center of the circle O to the line l can be found using the formula for the distance from a point to a line. However, we note that when the line OM is perpendicular to l, d is maximum and equal to the length of OM. 4. Calculate OM using the distance formula: OM = sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5. 5. Since the radius of the circle is 2, the maximum distance from any point Q on the circle to the line l is the sum of OM and the radius: 5 + 2 = 7. Therefore, boxed{Atext{ is correct}}. **For Option B:** 1. For the chord length of line l intersecting circle O to be maximum, the line must pass through the center of the circle, which is the origin (0,0). 2.

Since the hyperbola has the same foci as the ellipse, the coordinates of the foci of the hyperbola are also (0, pm3). Given that the hyperbola passes through the point (sqrt{15}, 4), let's denote the semi-major axis of the hyperbola as a and the semi-minor axis as b. Since the hyperbola has the same foci as the ellipse, the distance between the foci is 2c = 6 where c is the focal distance. Therefore, c=3. From the definition of a hyperbola, we know that the difference in distances from any point on the hyperbola to the foci is 2a. Specifically, for the point (sqrt{15}, 4): 2a = | (sqrt{15} - 0)^2 + (4 - 3)^2 - (sqrt{15} - 0)^2 + (4 + 3)^2 | = | 16 - 49 | = 33 However, this equation is not properly set up according to the definition of a hyperbola, which states that 2a is the absolute difference between distances from a point to each foci. Thus, the difference should take into account the lengths of the semi-major axis along the y-direction, leading to: 2a = | sqrt{sqrt{15}^2 + (4 - 3)^2} - sqrt{sqrt{15}^2 + (4 + 3)^2} | = | sqrt{15 + 1} - sqrt{15 + 49} | = | sqrt{16} - sqrt{64} | = | 4 - 8 | = 4 Therefore, the semi-major axis a is: a = frac{2a}{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2 Next, we find the relationship between a, b, and c for a hyperbola, which is c^2 = a^2 + b^2. Solving for b^2, we get: b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 3^2 - 2^2 = 9 - 4 = 5 Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is: frac{y^2}{a^2} - frac{x^2}{b^2} = frac{y^2}{4} - frac{x^2}{5} = 1 So the final equation of the hyperbola is boxed{frac{y^2}{4} - frac{x^2}{5} = 1}.

These forms obviously satisfy the condition since: - If f(n) = k, then f(n) is constant and does not contain the digit 7 if k in K. - If f(n) = an + b, then each term either shifts the digits of n (if a is a power of 10) or adds a number b that does not introduce the digit 7, provided b < a. Step 2: Prove that other forms of f(n) do not satisfy the condition We need to show that any polynomial not of the form specified above will yield f(n) notin K for some n in K. # Case 1: Monomials f(n) = an If a is not a power of 10, then log_{10} a is irrational. By Dirichlet's approximation theorem, there exist integers x such that 10^x a is arbitrarily close to an integer whose first digit is 7. Thus, for some n in K, an will start with the digit 7, implying an notin K. # Case 2: Higher degree monomials f(n) = an^x for x > 1 - If a is not a power of 10, similar arguments as in Case 1 apply. - If a is a power of 10, consider f(n) = a n^x. For large enough n in K, the leading term an^x will dominate, and if x > 1, the growth of n^x will eventually lead to a digit 7 appearing in an^x. # Case 3: General polynomials f(n) = a_0 + a_1 n + cdots + a_x n^x For any m in K and large enough y, consider n = m cdot 10^y.

(2) If the two zeros of f(x) are x_{1} and x_{2}, prove that {x}_{1}{x}_{2} > {e}^{2{x}_{1}{x}_{2}}.","completion":"# Solution: Part (1): Finding the range of real numbers for a Given f(x)={e}^{x}-aleft(frac{ln x+x}{x}right), we can rewrite it as f(x)=frac{x{e}^{x}-a(ln x+x)}{x}. This function has two zeros if and only if the numerator, which we'll denote as h(x)=xe^{x}-a(ln x+x), has two zeros for x > 0. Let's introduce a substitution t=xe^{x}. The derivative of t with respect to x is t'=(x+1)e^{x}, which is always greater than 0 for x > 0. This means t=xe^{x} is monotonically increasing for x > 0. Therefore, having two zeros for h(x) is equivalent to having two zeros for g(t)=t-aln t. To analyze g(t), we find its derivative: g'(t)=1-frac{a}{t}=frac{t-a}{t}. - For aleqslant 0, g'(t) > 0 for all t > 0, making g(t) monotonically increasing, which cannot yield two zeros. - For a > 0, we have two cases: - If t > a, then g'(t) > 0, making g(t) monotonically increasing. - If 0 < t < a, then g'(t) < 0, making g(t) monotonically decreasing. The minimum of g(t) occurs at t=a, giving us g_{min}(a)=a-aln a. Analyzing this expression: - If 0 < a < e, then g(a) > 0, and g(t) does not have zeros. - If a=e, then g(a)=0, and g(t) has exactly one zero. - If a > e, then g(a) < 0, and since g(1)=1 > 0, g(e)=e-a < 0, and g(e^a)=e^a-a^2 > 0, g(t) has one zero in (1,e) and another in (e,e^a), meeting the requirement for two zeros. Therefore, the range of a for which f(x) has two zeros is a in boxed{(e,+infty)}. Part (2): Proving {x}_{1}{x}_{2} > {e}^{2-{x}_{1}-{x}_{2}} To prove {x}_{1}{x}_{2} > {e}^{2-{x}_{1}-{x}_{2}}, it suffices to show ({x}_{1}{e}^{{x}_{1}})({x}_{2}{e}^{{x}_{2}}) > {e}^{2}. This is equivalent to proving ln({x}_{1}{e}^{{x}_{1}})+ln({x}_{2}{e}^{{x}_{2}}) > 2. Given t_{1}=x_{1}{e}^{x_{1}} and t_{2}=x_{2}{e}^{x_{2}}, we need to show ln t_{1}+ln t_{2} > 2. Since aln t_{1}=t_{1} and aln t_{2}=t_{2}, we have a(ln t_{2}-ln t_{1})=t_{2}-t_{1} and a(ln t_{2}+ln t_{1})=t_{2}+t_{1}. This leads to ln{t}_{2}+ln{t}_{1}=frac{{t}_{2}+{t}_{1}}{{t}_{2}-{t}_{1}}(ln{t}_{2}-ln{t}_{1})=frac{(frac{{t}_{2}}{{t}_{1}}+1)lnfrac{{t}_{2}}{{t}_{1}}}{frac{{t}_{2}}{{t}_{1}}-1}. Let t=frac{t_{2}}{t_{1}} > 1, we need to prove ln t > 2frac{t-1}{t+1}, which simplifies to ln t+frac{4}{t+1}-2 > 0. Define h(t)=ln t+frac{4}{t+1}-2 with t > 1. The derivative h'(t)=frac{1}{t}-frac{4}{(t+1)^{2}}=frac{(t-1)^{2}}{t(t+1)^{2}} > 0, indicating h(t) is increasing for t > 1. Since h(1)=0, for t > 1, h(t) > 0 holds. Therefore, ln t_{1}+ln t_{2} > 2, which implies ({x}_{1}{e}^{{x}_{1}})({x}_{2}{e}^{{x}_{2}}) > {e}^{2}.

The surface of the disc is horizontal and smooth. A small washer is tied to the axis by a light thread, lies on the disc, and rotates with it. The radius of the disc is ( R ), and the length of the thread is ( frac{R}{4} ). The thread breaks. How long will it take for the washer to leave the disc? 1. **Determine the Initial Tangential Velocity of the Washer:** The initial tangential velocity ( V_0 ) of the washer can be calculated by using the frequency ( n ) and the distance from the axis ( r = frac{R}{4} ). The tangential velocity is given by: [ V_0 = 2 pi n cdot frac{R}{4} ] 2. **Calculate the Distance the Washer Needs to Travel to Leave the Disc:** When the washer is released, it will travel in a straight line (not circular) due to inertia. To find the straight-line distance ( l ) it needs to travel to reach the edge of the disc, use the Pythagorean theorem. The distance from the center to the edge of the disc is ( R ), and the initial position of the washer is ( frac{R}{4} ). Therefore: [ l = sqrt{R^2 - left( frac{R}{4} right)^2} = sqrt{R^2 - frac{R^2}{16}} = R sqrt{1 - frac{1}{16}} = R sqrt{frac{15}{16}} = frac{sqrt{15}}{4} R ] 3. **Calculate the Time for the Washer to Leave the Disc:** The time ( T ) it takes for the washer to travel the distance ( l ) with the initial tangential velocity ( V_0 ) can be found using the relation: [ T = frac{l}{V_0} ] Substitute the values of ( l ) and ( V_0 ): [ T = frac{frac{sqrt{15}}{4} R}{2 pi n cdot frac{R}{4}} = frac{frac{sqrt{15}}{4} R}{frac{R}{2} pi n} = frac{sqrt{15} R}{4} cdot frac{4}{2 pi n R} = frac{sqrt{15}}{2 pi n} ] # Conclusion: The time ( T ) it takes for the washer to leave the disc is: [ boxed{frac{sqrt{15}}{2 pi n}} ]"},{"prompt":"Quadratic polynomials ( P(x) ) and ( Q(x) ) with real coefficients are such that together they have 4 distinct real roots, and each of the polynomials ( P(Q(x)) ) and ( Q(P(x)) ) has 4 distinct real roots.

Let's start examining the problem by considering two quadratic polynomials P(x) and Q(x) with real coefficients, which collectively have 4 distinct real roots. 2. Suppose each polynomial within P(Q(x)) and Q(P(x)) also has 4 distinct real roots each. 3. First, observe that if among the roots of the polynomial P(Q(x)), there is a root Q(x), say x_0, then (P(Q(x_0)) = P(0) = 0). This implies that 0 is a root of (P(x)). 4. Similarly, if the roots of (Q(P(x))) include a root of the polynomial (P(x)), then 0 is a root of (Q(x)). 5. However, (P(x)) and (Q(x)) cannot both have 0 as a root simultaneously. If they did, collectively they would have fewer than 4 distinct roots. 6. From this observation, we can estimate the total number of different roots. If there were fewer than 6 roots, then P(Q(x)) and Q(x) would share a common root, and Q(P(x)) and P(x) would share another common root, which contradicts our initial condition. 7. Next, construct a specific example where the number of different roots is exactly 6. Let (P(x) = frac{1}{2}x(x-3)) and (Q(x) = -frac{3}{2}(x+1)(x-2)). For these polynomials: - P(x) has roots at 0 and 3. - Q(x) has roots at -1 and 2. Now, consider P(Q(x)): [ P(Q(x)) = P(-frac{3}{2}(x+1)(x-2)) ] The roots of P(Q(x)) include the roots of Q(x) and can be calculated as -1, 0, 1, 2. Similarly, consider Q(P(x)): [ Q(P(x)) = Q(frac{1}{2}x(x-3)) ] The roots of Q(P(x)) include the roots of P(x) and can be calculated as -1, 1, 2, 4. 8. Collectively, the roots of all considered polynomials are the integers from -1 to 4. 9. Note that there are indeed other examples available where the total number of distinct roots is exactly 6. For instance: - Another pair could be (P(x) = x(x-3)) and (Q(x) = -frac{3}{4}(x+1)(x-4)). 10. Therefore, the minimum number of different real numbers among the roots of the polynomials P(x), Q(x), P(Q(x)), and Q(P(x)) is 6. # Conclusion: [ boxed{6} ]"},{"prompt":"A regular 12gon ( A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{12} ) has a minus sign at vertex ( A_{1} ) and plus signs at all the other vertices.

Let’s explore how this influences the parity (even or odd nature) of the signs in each pair through multiple steps: 3. **Changes in signs after operations:** We note the alternating patterns in signs after operations. If after an odd number of operations, particular pairs have different signs; otherwise, they have the same sign. 5. **Verification of impossible configuration:** To make the sign in ( A_2 ) to a minus and other vertices plus, particularly in pairs ( (A_2, A_8) ) and ( (A_3, A_9) ) the signs must maintain an alternating pattern.

For instance, if one number in the pair is (123456), its complement will be (876543) (since (1+8=9), (2+7=9), (3+6=9), etc.).

Specifically, we need to find ( k ) such that for any homogeneous polynomial ( P(x_1, ldots, x_k) ) of degree 2, there exist ( 2 times 2 ) matrices ( A_1, ldots, A_k ) such that: [ P(x_1, ldots, x_k) = det left( sum_{i=1}^{k} x_i A_i right). ] 2. **Case ( k = 1 ) and ( k = 2 ):** - For ( k = 1 ), any homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 is of the form ( P(x_1) = c x_1^2 ). We can choose ( A_1 = begin{pmatrix} sqrt{c} & 0 0 & sqrt{c} end{pmatrix} ), and then: [ det(x_1 A_1) = det left( x_1 begin{pmatrix} sqrt{c} & 0 0 & sqrt{c} end{pmatrix} right) = x_1^2 c = P(x_1). ] - For ( k = 2 ), consider any homogeneous polynomial of degree 2, ( P(x_1, x_2) = a x_1^2 + b x_2^2 + c x_1 x_2 ). We can choose: [ A_1 = begin{pmatrix} sqrt{a} & 0 0 & sqrt{a} end{pmatrix}, quad A_2 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & sqrt{b} sqrt{b} & 0 end{pmatrix}, quad A_3 = begin{pmatrix} 0 & frac{c}{2} frac{c}{2} & 0 end{pmatrix}. ] Then: [ det(x_1 A_1 + x_2 A_2 + x_3 A_3) = a x_1^2 + b x_2^2 + c x_1 x_2 = P(x_1, x_2). ] 3. **Case ( k = 3 ):** - We need to show that not all homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 in 3 variables can be expressed in the desired form. Consider the polynomial ( P(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 ). - Assume there exist ( 2 times 2 ) matrices ( A, B, C ) such that: [ det(x_1 A + x_2 B + x_3 C) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2. ] - This implies that ( A, B, C ) must satisfy certain properties. Specifically, since the determinant of a ( 2 times 2 ) matrix is a quadratic form, the matrices must be such that their combination yields the polynomial ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 ). - By Cayley-Hamilton theorem, for any ( 2 times 2 ) matrix ( M ), ( M^2 - (text{tr}(M))M + det(M)I = 0 ). For ( A, B, C ) to satisfy the polynomial, they must have specific traces and determinants. - If we assume ( A = I ) (identity matrix), then: [ det(x_1 I + x_2 B + x_3 C) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2. ] - This implies ( B^2 = -I ) and ( C^2 = -I ), which means ( B ) and ( C ) are similar to the imaginary unit ( i ) in the complex numbers, leading to a contradiction since the group generated by such matrices is non-abelian and finite, which cannot be the case for real matrices. 4. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, ( k = 3 ) does not work, and the only values of ( k ) for which all homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 are good are ( k leq 2 ).

The triangles (BKP) and (CLQ) are equilateral and constructed outside of triangle (ABC). 2. **Analysis of Interior Angles:** Since (angle A = 120^circ), the remaining angles sum to (60^circ). Specifically, we have (angle ABC + angle ACB = 60^circ). 3. **Parallel Line Segments:** Since (BKP) and (CLQ) are equilateral triangles, their interior angles are each (60^circ). Therefore, (BP parallel CQ). 4. **Perpendicular Distances:** Define (X) and (Y) as the feet of the perpendiculars from (A) to (BP) and (CQ), respectively. Because of the equilateral triangles, these perpendiculars correspond to altitudes: [ AX = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} |AB| ] and [ AY = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} |AC|. ] 5. **Collinearity:** Points (X), (A), and (Y) are collinear and therefore lie on the same straight line. The distance (XY) between the feet of the perpendiculars (X) and (Y) is the sum of these perpendicular distances: [ XY = AX + AY = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} |AB| + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} |AC| = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} (|AB| + |AC|). ] 6. **Minimum Distance Consideration:** Since (BP) and (CQ) are parallel, the segment (PQ) that connects (P) and (Q) must be at least as long as any segment connecting analogous points on (BP) and (CQ): [ |PQ| geq |XY|. ] From the steps above, we have shown that: [ |P Q| geq |X Y| = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} (|AB| + |AC|). ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{|P Q| geq frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot (|A B| + |A C|)}. ]"},{"prompt":"Let (mathbf{p} = begin{pmatrix} 2 7 4 end{pmatrix}), (mathbf{q} = begin{pmatrix} 3 frac{5}{3} 2 end{pmatrix}), and (mathbf{r} = begin{pmatrix} 6 1 3 end{pmatrix}).

Using the same logic as in the provided solution, we identify the orthocenter of triangle (ABC) by finding the intersection of the altitudes from vertices to the opposite sides. The equation for line ( BE ) (altitude from ( B )) is ( x = 15 ) since it is vertical through midpoint ( E ). To find the equation of line ( AD ) (altitude from ( A )), we first find the slope of ( BC ). Since ( B = (30,0) ) and ( C = (15,20) ), the slope of ( BC ) is (frac{20 - 0}{15 - 30} = frac{20}{-15} = -frac{4}{3}). The slope of ( AD ) is the negative reciprocal, ( frac{3}{4} ), and since it passes through ( (0,0) ), its equation is ( y = frac{3}{4}x ). These lines intersect at ( x = 15 ), so substituting into ( y = frac{3}{4}x ) gives ( y = frac{3}{4}(15) = 11.25 ). Thus, the orthocenter is at ( (15, 11.25) ).

Lindy runs at a constant speed of 10 feet per second from Christina to Jack, back to Christina, back to Jack, and so forth.

What is the total distance, in feet, that Lindy has traveled when the three meet at one place?","completion":"Let's first calculate the time it takes for Jack and Christina to meet. Since they are walking towards each other, we can add their speeds to determine the rate at which the distance between them decreases. Jack's speed = 7 feet per second Christina's speed = 8 feet per second Combined speed = 7 + 8 = 15 feet per second The distance between them is 150 feet, so the time it takes for them to meet is: Time = Distance / Speed = 150 feet / 15 feet per second = 10 seconds Now, let's calculate the distance Lindy travels in this time. Since Lindy is running back and forth at a constant speed of 10 feet per second, we can simply multiply Lindy's speed by the time to find the total distance Lindy travels. Lindy's speed = 10 feet per second Time = 10 seconds Total distance Lindy travels = Lindy's speed * Time = 10 feet/second * 10 seconds = 100 feet Therefore, Lindy has traveled a total distance of boxed{100} feet when the three meet at one place."},{"prompt":"Given that tan alpha = 3, calculate the following expression: frac {sin(alphapi)+cos(pialpha)}{sin( frac {pi}{2}alpha )+cos( frac {pi}{2}+alpha )}.","completion":"Since tan alpha = 3, we can simplify the given expression using trigonometric identities. Let's proceed with the simplification steps: 1. Utilize the periodicity of the sine and cosine functions, which tells us that sin(theta - pi) = -sin(theta) and cos(pi - theta) = -cos(theta). Apply these to the expression: begin{align*} frac {sin(alpha-pi)+cos(pi-alpha)}{sin( frac {pi}{2}-alpha )+cos( frac {pi}{2}+alpha )} &= frac {-sin(alpha)-cos(alpha)}{sin( frac {pi}{2}-alpha )+cos( frac {pi}{2}+alpha )}. end{align*} 2. Recognizing that sin(frac{pi}{2} - theta) = cos(theta) and cos(frac{pi}{2} + theta) = -sin(theta), we apply these to the denominator: begin{align*} frac {-sin(alpha)-cos(alpha)}{sin( frac {pi}{2}-alpha )+cos( frac {pi}{2}+alpha )} &= frac {-sin(alpha)-cos(alpha)}{cos(alpha) - sin(alpha)}. end{align*} 3. Factor out -1 from the numerator to simplify the expression further: begin{align*} frac {-sin(alpha)-cos(alpha)}{cos(alpha) - sin(alpha)} &= frac {-1(sin(alpha) + cos(alpha))}{cos(alpha) - sin(alpha)}. end{align*} 4. Next, we express sin(alpha) and cos(alpha) in terms of tan(alpha). Since tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} = 3, we get sin alpha = 3cos alpha. Substituting this into the expression gives: begin{align*} frac {-1(3cos(alpha) + cos(alpha))}{cos(alpha) - 3cos(alpha)} &= frac {-1(4cos(alpha))}{-2cos(alpha)}. end{align*} 5.

Additionally, we need to show that the center of the rotational homothety that maps one of these triangles to the other lies on the similarity circle of the figures F_1, F_2, and F_3. 1. **Define Intersections**: - Let P_1 be the intersection of the lines A_2 B_2 and A_3 B_3, and let P_1' be the intersection of the lines A_2 C_2 and A_3 C_3. - Similarly, define points P_2 and P_3 as well as P_2' and P_3'. 2. **Rotational Homothety**: - Consider the rotational homothety mapping F_1 to F_2.

Let's start by examining the given expression under all stars being replaced by plusses: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 ] Summing these numbers, we get: [ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55 ] This is because the sum of the first ( n ) positive integers is given by the formula: [ sum_{i=1}^n i = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ] For ( n = 10 ): [ frac{10 cdot 11}{2} = 55 ] 2. Next, we consider modifications to the sum by changing a plus sign to a minus sign: - Changing one plus to a minus will decrease the sum by twice the value of the number being negated.

It turns out that the graphs of any two of them have exactly one common point. Prove that the graphs of all the polynomials have a common point.","completion":"1. We start by considering two arbitrary quadratic trinomials (f(x)) and (g(x)). From the problem statement, we know that their graphs intersect exactly at one point. 2. Let ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ) and ( g(x) = dx^2 + ex + f ), where (a neq d) because the leading coefficients are distinct. 3. Since (f(x)) and (g(x)) intersect at exactly one point, the equation ( f(x)-g(x) ) should have exactly one root. This implies: [ f(x) - g(x) = (ax^2 + bx + c) - (dx^2 + ex + f) = (a-d)x^2 + (b-e)x + (c-f) ] 4. For the above quadratic equation to have exactly one root, its discriminant must be zero. The discriminant (Delta) of a quadratic equation (Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0) is given by: [ Delta = B^2 - 4AC ] Here: [ A = a - d, quad B = b - e, quad C = c - f ] Thus: [ Delta = (b - e)^2 - 4(a - d)(c - f) ] For a single root, we must have: [ (b - e)^2 - 4(a - d)(c - f) = 0 ] 5. Now consider three quadratic trinomials ( f(x) ), ( g(x) ), and ( h(x) ). Let their pairwise intersections also follow the same pattern, leading us to thus have: - ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) intersect exactly once. - ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) intersect exactly once. - ( f(x) ) and ( h(x) ) intercept exactly once. 6. Given that each pairwise difference ( f(x) - g(x) ), ( g(x) - h(x) ), and ( f(x) - h(x) ) must have exactly one root, let's express (f - g) as: [ f(x) - g(x) = a (x - x_1)^2 ] where (x = x_1) is the single root for the difference between (f(x)) and (g(x)). 7. Similarly, for (g(x) - h(x)) and (f(x) - h(x)), we can write: [ g(x) - h(x) = b (x - x_2)^2 ] [ f(x) - h(x) = c(x - x_3)^2 ] 8. Let's consider (f(x) - h(x)) in terms of the other functions: [ f(x) - h(x) = (f(x) - g(x)) + (g(x) - h(x)) = a(x - x_1)^2 + b(x - x_2)^2 ] 9. For ( f(x) - h(x) ) to have exactly one root, it must hold: - ( a(x - x_1)^2 + b(x - x_2)^2 ) 10. For this expression to have exactly one root, either ( x_1 = x_2 ), implying all quadratics intersect at the same point. Hence we can infer that for any quadratics from our hundred quadratic trinomials, their intersections always align at a common point. 11. If we generalize this result, every quadratic trinomial in the set of hundred will intersect at one common point shared by any two quadratic trinomials. Conclusion: Therefore, the graphs of all quadratic trinomials in the set intersect at a single common point. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Daliah picked up 17.5 pounds of garbage.

When the leftmost digit of ( n ) is shifted to the rightmost position, the result is ( frac{n}{3} ). We need to find the smallest possible value of the sum of the digits of ( n ). 2. Let ( n ) be represented as ( n = a_1a_2a_3 ldots a_d ) in base 10, where ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_d ) are the digits of ( n ). Shifting the leftmost digit ( a_1 ) to the rightmost position gives us a new number ( m = a_2a_3 ldots a_d a_1 ). 3. According to the problem, ( m = frac{n}{3} ).

To find ( n ), we need to solve this equation. Let's consider the repeating decimal representation of ( n ). Let ( x ) be the repeating decimal where the repeating digits are the digits of ( n ) with the order of the digits of ( n ) preserved. Formally, if ( n ) has ( d ) digits, then: [ x = n cdot left( frac{1}{10^d} + frac{1}{10^{2d}} + frac{1}{10^{3d}} + cdots right) = frac{n}{10^d - 1} ] 7. Note that ( 0 < x < 1 ). Now consider the fractional part of ( 10x ). This repeating decimal has the digits of ( n ), but the order of the digits has been changed so that the first digit is now the last and the rest of the digits preserve their relative order. By the problem statement, the repeating digits are the digits of ( frac{n}{3} ) in the same order, so the repeating decimal equals ( frac{x}{3} ). Therefore: [ 10x - frac{x}{3} = frac{29x}{3} ] 8. Since ( frac{29x}{3} ) is an integer and ( 0 < x < 1 ), the values of ( x ) are in the form ( frac{3k}{29} ) where ( k ) is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive. We need to find the smallest possible value of the sum of the digits of ( n ). 9. Compute the decimal representation of ( frac{3k}{29} ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 9 ) and find the sum of the digits.

This subset sums to ( m+1 ) but is not a subset of ({1, 2, ldots, m}) that sums to ( m ) because ({1, k, k}) is not valid for ( m ). 5. **Case when ( m ) is even**: - Let ( m = 2k ) for ( k geq 1 ). - Consider the subset ({k, k+1}).

We don't know how many games this is yet, so we'll call the number of remaining games ( R ), and the number of games won from these remaining games is ( 0.50 times R ). The total number of games won for the entire season is 70% of the total number of games played, which is ( 0.70 times G ). Now we can set up an equation to represent the total number of games won: [ 75 + 0.50R = 0.70G ] We also know that the total number of games ( G ) is the sum of the first 100 games and the remaining games ( R ): [ G = 100 + R ] Now we can substitute ( G ) from the second equation into the first equation: [ 75 + 0.50R = 0.70(100 + R) ] Expanding the right side of the equation: [ 75 + 0.50R = 70 + 0.70R ] Now, let's move the terms involving ( R ) to one side and the constant terms to the other side: [ 0.50R - 0.70R = 70 - 75 ] [ -0.20R = -5 ] Divide both sides by -0.20 to solve for ( R ): [ R = frac{-5}{-0.20} ] [ R = 25 ] So, the team played an additional 25 games after the first 100 games.

Consider the instance with 19 copies of the number ( 0.9 + varepsilon ) for some small (positive) ( varepsilon ) very close to 0. The total sum of these numbers is: [ 19 times (0.9 + varepsilon) = 17.1 + 19varepsilon ] If we try to partition these numbers into two groups, one of the groups must contain at least 10 copies. The sum of these 10 copies is: [ 10 times (0.9 + varepsilon) = 9 + 10varepsilon ] Since ( varepsilon ) is positive, ( 9 + 10varepsilon > 9 ). Therefore, it is impossible to partition these numbers into two groups with sums not exceeding 9 if ( S > 17.1 ). 2. **Proving that ( S = frac{171}{10} ) works:** (B) The value ( S = frac{171}{10} ) works. Consider a set of ( n ) real numbers ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) such that ( x_1 ge x_2 ge cdots ge x_n ). We will form two groups by starting with two empty groups and assigning each number ( x_i ) to the group with the currently smaller sum. Suppose we get stuck at some moment while trying to assign ( x_k ). At this moment, we have assigned ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{k-1} ) to the two groups, and the sum of all these assigned numbers is at most ( S - x_k ). (1) The smaller sum of the two groups is at most ( frac{S - x_k}{2} ). (2) Since we are stuck, this means that adding ( x_k ) to the group with the smaller sum would exceed 9: [ x_k + frac{S - x_k}{2} > 9 ] Simplifying this inequality: [ 2x_k + S - x_k > 18 implies x_k + S > 18 implies x_k > 18 - S ] Given ( S = frac{171}{10} ): [ x_k > 18 - frac{171}{10} = 18 - 17.1 = 0.9 ] Therefore, ( x_k > 0.9 ). (3) Suppose ( k ge 19 ). Then ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k > 0.9 ) implies that the sum of all these numbers is strictly above: [ 19 times 0.9 = 17.1 ] This contradicts the assumption that the total sum is at most ( S = 17.1 ). Hence, ( k le 18 ). (4) Since ( k le 18 ), one of the two groups (at the moment before assigning ( x_k )) contains at most 8 numbers. Since all numbers are from ([0,1]), the sum of that group is at most 8. Therefore, ( x_k ) can be added to this group without exceeding the bound of 9.

The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 5 lines can be calculated using the combination formula ( C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} ), where ( n ) is the total number of lines and ( k ) is the number of lines to choose. [ C(5, 2) = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10 ] So, there are 10 ways to choose the horizontal sides. 3. **Choose vertical sides:** Similarly, we choose two different vertical lines from the 6 available lines to be the left and right edges of the rectangle. The number of ways to choose 2 lines from 6 lines can be calculated as: [ C(6, 2) = frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1} = 15 ] So, there are 15 ways to choose the vertical sides. 4. **Calculate the total number of rectangles:** Each choice of two horizontal lines and two vertical lines uniquely determines a rectangle.

Since the small monkey dolls are 2 cheaper, the cost of a small monkey doll would be L - 2. If Dhoni buys only large monkey dolls, the number of dolls he can buy is 300 / L. If he buys only small monkey dolls, the number of dolls he can buy is 300 / (L - 2). According to the information given, Dhoni could buy 25 more small monkey dolls than large monkey dolls.

The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. The angle between two sides corresponds to twice the vertex angle because we are extending the sides. 3. **Angle Relation in Regular n-gon:** For a regular n-gon, each central angle (the angle subtended by each side at the center of the circle) is frac{360^circ}{n}.

First, we see that M contains 1 and N contains 0. For the sets to be equal, 1 must be equal to 0, which is not possible. However, since the sets still must be equal, 1 must not be equated to 0 but to the other elements in N. Thus, 1 must be equal to frac{b}{a} or b. 2. We cannot equate 1 to b directly, because if 1=b, then b=1. But this leads to a contradiction as no element in M is equal to 0. Therefore, 1 = frac{b}{a}, which leads to a = b. 3. Now that we know a = b, we can say a + b = a + a = 2a = 0 for the sets to be equal (as a + b is in M and corresponds to the 0 in N). Solving 2a = 0 gives us a = 0. But this poses a problem because if a = 0, then frac{b}{a} is undefined. 4. To rectify this issue, we must think differently. Instead of a = b, we use the fact that 1 = frac{b}{a}. This leads us to b = a. Substituting this into a + b = 0 gives us a + a = 0 or 2a = 0, which implies a = 0. But as before, a cannot be 0 since it would make frac{b}{a} undefined. 5. To solve this, we rearrange the equation 1 = frac{b}{a} to get a = b. Then, using a + b = 0, we substitute a for b and get a + a = 2a = 0 leading to a = 0. 6. With a = 0, this contradicts the initial statement that a cannot be 0. Therefore, we reconsider our initial approach. We realize that a+b must be the element that is equal to 0 (as both are in the sets M and N respectively), not a equaling b. 7. Now, using the correct equations: since 1 must equal frac{b}{a}, we get a = b. From a + b = 0, and knowing that a = b, we get 2b = 0 or b = 0. 8. However, this also leads to a contradiction since if b = 0, then frac{b}{a} = 0 and there would be a duplicate 0 in set N, which is not allowed because the elements in a set must be unique. 9. Therefore, 1 cannot equal frac{b}{a}; otherwise, we end up with contradictions. This means we must have 1 = b and frac{b}{a} = a, leading to a^2 = b. 10. Now, using a + b = 0 with 1 = b, we have a + 1 = 0, which provides a = -1. 11. Substituting a = -1 into a^2 = b, we find that b = (-1)^2 = 1. Finally, we calculate b^{2014} - a^{2013} using b = 1 and a = -1: [b^{2014} - a^{2013} = 1^{2014} - (-1)^{2013}] [= 1 - (-1)] [= 1 + 1] [= boxed{2}.]"},{"prompt":"Given that a > 0 and b > 0 satisfy a + b = 1, find the minimum value of frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b}: A: 12 B: 16 C: 20 D: 25","completion":"Since a > 0 and b > 0 and they satisfy a + b = 1, we have: frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b} = left(frac{1}{a} + frac{9}{b}right)(a + b) = 10 + frac{b}{a} + frac{9a}{b} Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality), we have: frac{b}{a} + frac{9a}{b} geq 2sqrt{frac{b}{a} cdot frac{9a}{b}} = 6 Equality holds if and only if frac{b}{a} = frac{9a}{b}, which leads to a = frac{1}{4} and b = frac{3}{4}.

We need to determine the smallest number of 1's that the sum a + b could possibly have in its binary representation. To proceed with the solution, consider the properties of binary addition. When there are carries involved in binary addition, the number of 1's can be reduced. Let's explore the optimal configuration to minimize the number of 1's in the resulting sum a + b. 1. **Consider the simplest cases to find a pattern**: - If we add a number with a single 1 and a number with multiple 1's, the presence of carries can affect the total count of 1's. - For example, 1_2 + 1_2 = 10_2, where there is just one 1 in the binary representation of 2_{10}. 2. **Represent the numbers carefully to produce carrying**: Let's emphasize the example given in the reference solution: - Suppose a is a number with 2004 1's which could be strategically placed to produce maximum carries when added with b. - b is another number with 2005 1's. 3. **Addition of binary numbers involving carrying**: Let's think of: [ a = 111 ldots 100 ldots 01 ] where there is an appropriate arrangement of 1's and 0's. - Imagine a has its 1's spread in such a way leading to large carries with b. - Take b as a long streak of 1's: [ b = 11 ldots 11 ] We can illustrate the addition as follows with a possible arrangement: [ begin{array}{r} 111 cdots 100 cdots 01 + 11 cdots 11 hline 1000 cdots 000 end{array} ] By setting up the above result, where suitable carries occur, the final number of 1's can be minimized. 4. **Formal configuration**: - One sees that efficient placement results in carrying forward producing a result like: a = 2^{4008} - 2^{2005} + 1 b = 2^{2005} - 1 5. **Conclusion**: The addition leads to one large carry through the digits making the sum: [ a + b = 2^{4008} ] which has only one 1 in its binary representation.

The formula for the centroid is given by the average of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the vertices. Therefore, if C has coordinates (m,n), the centroid is left(frac{2+m}{3}, frac{4+n}{3}right). Step 2: Substitute the centroid into the Euler line equation. Plugging the coordinates of the centroid into the equation of the Euler line yields frac{2+m}{3} - frac{4+n}{3} + 2 = 0. Simplifying this equation gives m - n + 4 = 0 quad (1). Step 3: Calculate the slope of AB and find the circumcenter. The midpoint of AB is (1,2), and the slope of AB, k_{AB}, is calculated as frac{4-0}{0-2} = -2. The perpendicular bisector to AB, which also passes through the circumcenter, has the equation y-2=frac{1}{2}(x-1), simplifying to x - 2y + 3 = 0. Step 4: Find the circumcenter by solving the system of equations. We solve the system of equations left{begin{array}{l}{x-2y+3=0}{x-y+2=0}end{array}right., obtaining the circumcenter's coordinates as (-1,1). Step 5: Use the circumcenter to find the relationship between m and n. Knowing the circumcenter is (-1,1), we use the distance formula with C(m,n), equating it to the known distances, (m+1)^{2} + (n-1)^{2} = 10, simplifying to m^{2} + n^{2} + 2m - 2n = 8 quad (2).

The equation of the asymptote is: y=pm frac {3}{4}x, i.e., 3xpm4y=0. Therefore, the distance from the vertex to the asymptote is d= frac {| pm 12|}{ sqrt {3^{2}+4^{2}}} = frac {12}{5}. Hence, proposition ② is correct. ③ bigodot C_1: x^2+y^2+2x=0 can be rewritten as (x+1)^2+y^2=1. Therefore, the center of C_1 is (-1,0), and the radius r_1=1. bigodot C_2: x^2+y^2+2y-1=0 can be rewritten as x^2+(y+1)^2=2. Therefore, the center of C_2 is (0,-1), and the radius r_{2}= sqrt {2}.

Combining these intervals, the solution set is frac{1}{2} < x < frac{5}{2}, which we can write as: boxed{ left{x mid frac{1}{2} < x < frac{5}{2}right} }. (II) For the second part, we first note that the minimum value of f(x) = |x - 1| + |x - 2| is attained when x is between 1 and 2. In this range, f(x) = |(x - 1) - (x - 2)| = 1. Therefore, f(x) is always greater than or equal to 1. To have a non-empty solution set for f(x) < a, we must have a greater than the minimum value of f(x), which implies: a > 1.

This implies that all ( a_i ) must have the same parity (either all even or all odd). 3. **Odd ( n ):** If ( n ) is odd, we can construct an *expensive* ( n )-tuple by setting ( a_1 = a_2 = cdots = a_n = 1 ). Then: [ (1+1)(1+1) cdots (1+1) = 2^n ] Since ( n ) is odd, ( 2^n ) can be written as ( 2^{2k-1} ) for some ( k ). Hence, an *expensive* ( n )-tuple exists for odd ( n ). 4. **Even ( n ):** Suppose ( n = 2m ) is even. Assume all ( a_i ) are odd. Let ( a_i = 2b_i - 1 ) for ( i = 1, 2, dots, n ), where ( b_i geq 1 ).

The sequence ({m, f(m), f(f(m)), dots}) is strictly decreasing over odd positive integers and must eventually reach 1. 5. **Constructing the ( n )-tuple:** Let ( s ) be the smallest positive integer such that ( f^s(m) = 1 ).

Now, define (d_{i} = frac{c_{i}}{2^{l_{j}}}) for (i = 1, 2, cdots, 2n+1). 10. The sequence (d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{2n+1}) satisfies the original problem's condition (i.e., picking any (2n) numbers can always be split into two groups with equal sums). 11. Notice that (d_{j} = k_{j}) is odd and (d_{m+1} = d_{m+2} = cdots = d_{2n+1} = 0) are even. 12. Because the numbers (d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{2n+1}) are supposed to be able to split into two groups with equal sums, the sum of any (2n) numbers picked from these must be even. 13. However, since (d_{j}) for some (j) is odd, and (d_{m+1}, d_{m+2}, cdots, d_{2n+1}) are even, the total number of odd and even (d_i)'s must match the condition where their sum can be even, leading to a contradiction. Odd and even properties cannot simultaneously hold to satisfy the splitting condition where sums are equal. 14. Thus, our initial assumption that some (c_i neq 0) must be false. 15. Hence, all (c_i) must be zero. Consequently, all (b_i) are equal, and initially, all (a_i) must be equal.

If ( x + yi ) can be represented as the sum of squares of three complex integers, then ( y ) must be even. 2. If ( y ) is even, then ( x + yi ) can be represented as the sum of squares of three complex integers. Part 1: Necessity Assume ( x + yi = (a + bi)^2 + (c + di)^2 + (e + fi)^2 ), where ( a, b, c, d, e, f ) are integers. Expanding the sum of squares, we get: [ (a + bi)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi ] [ (c + di)^2 = c^2 - d^2 + 2cdi ] [ (e + fi)^2 = e^2 - f^2 + 2efi ] Adding these complex numbers together, the imaginary part can be expressed as: [ yi = 2(ab + cd + ef)i ] Thus, [ y = 2(ab + cd + ef) ] Since ( ab, cd, ef ) are products of integers, ( y ) must be even (( y = 2 times text{integer} )). Part 2: Sufficiency Suppose ( y ) is even, say ( y = 2u ) where ( u ) is an integer. We consider three cases based on the value of ( x ): 1. **Case: ( x = 2t + 1 ) for some integer ( t )** We have ( x + yi = (2t + 1) + 2ui ). This can be expressed as: [ (t + 1 + ui)^2 + (u - ti)^2 + 0 ] 2. **Case: ( x = 4t + 2 ) for some integer ( t )** We have ( x + yi = 4t + 2 + 2ui ). This can be written as: [ 2(2t + 1) + 2ui = 2((2t + 1) + ui) ] This shows ( x + yi = 2((t + 1 + ui)^2 + 0 + 0) ). 3. **Case: ( x = 4t ) for some integer ( t )** We split this case further based on ( y ): i.

Let's denote ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_8 ) as the given eight distinct positive integers such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of any three of these numbers is 1. 2.

Without loss of generality, assume ( a_1 < a_2 < cdots < a_8 ). 4. Consider the product of any six numbers chosen from ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_8 ). There are ( C_8^6 = 28 ) ways to choose 6 elements out of 8, leading to 28 distinct products. 5. Denote by ( M ) the set of these 28 products, so we have: [ M = { m_1, m_2, cdots, m_{28} } ] where each ( m_i ) is a product of a different combination of 6 elements from ( {a_1, a_2, cdots, a_8} ). 6. Clearly, the number of different products is: [ |M| geq 8 ] 7. Let's choose specific products to illustrate this: [ begin{array}{l} a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_6, quad a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_7, quad a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_5 a_8, a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_6 a_8, quad a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4 a_7 a_8, quad a_1 a_2 a_3 a_5 a_7 a_8, a_1 a_2 a_3 a_6 a_7 a_8, quad a_1 a_2 a_4 a_6 a_7 a_8 end{array} ] These eight products ensure that there are eight distinct integers. 8. For ( n = |M| geq 8 ), denote: [ M = { m_1, m_2, cdots, m_n } ] where each ( m_i ) is a distinct integer obtained as above. We need to prove that (gcd(m_1, m_2, cdots, m_n) = 1). 9. To show (gcd(m_1, m_2, cdots, m_n) = 1), consider any prime ( p ). Given that the GCD of any three of ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_8 ) is 1, ( p ) can divide at most two of these numbers. 10. Because ( p ) divides at most two of ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_8 ), it follows that ( p ) does not divide the product of any six remaining numbers. Hence, within the set ( M ), there is at least one number that is coprime with ( p ). 11. Consequently, (gcd(m_1, m_2, cdots, m_n) = 1 ). 12. Next, consider any three numbers ( m_p, m_q, m_r ) where ( 1 leq p < q < r leq n ). 13. Each ( m_i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq n )) is of the form: [ m_i = prod_{u in A_i} a_u ] where ( A_i ) is a six-element subset of ( {1, 2, cdots, 8} ). 14. From any selection of ( m_p, m_q, m_r ), form their union: [ A = {1,2, cdots, 8} ] Let: [ begin{array}{l} |A_p| = 6, quad |A_q| = 6, quad |A_r| = 6 end{array} ] 15. Given that: [ |A setminus (A_p cap A_q cap A_r)| = 8 - |A_p cap A_q cap A_r| ] and: [ |(A setminus A_p) cup (A setminus A_q) cup (A setminus A_r)| leq |A setminus A_p| + |A setminus A_q| + |A setminus A_r| = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 ] 16. Therefore, there must exist two numbers ( i, j in A_p cap A_q cap A_r ). 17. By the initial condition, (gcd(a_i, a_j) = 1), so: [ a_i a_j mid m_p, quad a_i a_j mid m_q, quad a_i a_j mid m_r ] 18. Thus: [ a_i a_j mid (m_p + m_q + m_r) ] 19. Hence, we have shown that there exists ( n geq 8 ) and distinct positive integers ( m_1, m_2, cdots, m_n ) such that any three numbers' sum is divisible by the product of two of ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_8 ).

This characteristic indicates that the quadrilateral might be a trapezium, as one pair of opposite sides are parallel. 7. **Rule out other quadrilateral types**: - **Rhombus**: A rhombus has all sides equal and opposite angles equal, which is not the case here. - **Parallelogram**: In a parallelogram, both pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Here, only one pair of sides could be parallel. - **Kite**: A kite usually has two pairs of adjacent angles and equal sides, which is not the case here. - **Arrowhead**: An arrowhead is generally characterized by concave angles, not fitting our angle set. 8. **Conclusion**: The quadrilateral meets the criterion for a trapezium: [ boxed{mathrm{E}} ]"},{"prompt":"You are the owner of a company that sells Tesla Model S electric cars.

Assuming that there is at least one dragon in (*), prove that the arithmetic mean of all elements that can be dragon heads in (*) is also greater than 1988.","completion":"Let's rewrite the detailed solution step-by-step as follows: 1. **Definition and Introduction:** Consider a finite sequence of real numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ).

Note that whether an element ( a_k ) (for ( 2 leq k leq n )) can be a dragon head is unrelated to the elements before ( a_k ). 3. **Establishing a Shortest Dragon:** For any ( a_k ) (for ( 1 leq k leq n )) that can be a dragon head, we define the shortest dragon starting from ( a_k ) as the minimum segment with ( a_k ) as the head such that the segment's average is greater than 1988. 4. **Dragon Length and Conditions:** Assume ( a_k ) can be the dragon head, and ( a_k, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{k+i} ) is the shortest dragon with ( a_k ) as the head. This implies that: - The segment ( a_k, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{k+i-1} ) is not a dragon (its average is ≤ 1988), - While the segment ( a_k, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{k+i} ) is a dragon (its average is > 1988). 5. **General Case for Dragon:** Thus, any substantial segment ( a_{k+l}, ldots, a_{k+l+j} ) with ( 0 leq i < j ) (where ( j > 0 )) is still a dragon, implying each segment ( a_{k}, ldots, a_{k+l-1} ) must maintain an average greater than 1988. 6. **First Element as Dragon Head:** Denote the first item that can serve as a dragon head in the sequence as ( a_{k1} ). The shortest dragon it forms is ( a_{k1}, a_{k1+1}, ldots, a_{k1+l1} ). 7. **Further Elements as Dragon Heads:** If there are more elements subsequently that can serve as dragon heads, denote the next one starting from ( k1 + l1 + 1 ) as ( a_{k2} ). Continue this method: - Identify ( a_{k2}, ldots, a_{k2+l2} ) with ( a_{k2+l2+1} ), - Proceed until no further dragons are identified. 8. **Final Identification and Conclusion:** Hence, obtain ( j ) such shortest dragons: [ a_{k1}, ldots, a_{k1+l1}; quad a_{k2}, ldots, a_{k2+l2}; quad ldots; quad a_{kj}, ldots, a_{kj+lj}. ] All elements ( a_{k1}, ldots, a_{k1+l1}; a_{k2}, ldots, a_{k2+l2}; ldots; a_{kj}, ldots, a_{kj+lj} ) have an average greater than 1988 based on the dragon definition and segmentation.

[ text{Total width} = 8 text{ cm} + 72 text{ cm} = 80 text{ cm} ] 4. **Determine the change in height**: As each sheet is placed 1 cm higher than the previous one, and considering we started from 5 cm, we calculate the increase in height with the same number of additional sheets: [ text{Total height addition} = 72 text{ sheets} times 1 text{ cm/sheet} = 72 text{ cm} ] 5. **Final calculation of ( x )**: Initially, the height covered was 5 cm.

By using the general term formula of the binomial expansion, where the exponent of the x term equals 0, we can find the relationship between n and r, and combined with the fact that n is a positive integer, we can then determine the answer. **Solution** Given the properties of binomial coefficients, the general term formula of its expansion can be obtained as: T_{r+1}=C_{n}^{r}(2x^{3})^{n-r}left(- dfrac{1}{{x}^{4}} right)^{r}=C_{n}^{r}·{(-1)}^{r}·{2}^{n-r}·{x}^{3n-7r}, Therefore, according to the problem, the expansion contains a non-zero constant term, Thus, we have 3n-7r=0, Therefore, solving this gives r=dfrac{3n}{7}, which means 3n is a multiple of 7, and n is a positive integer; Therefore, the minimum value of n is 7.

The relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds because they are moving towards each other. The speed of the slower train is 36 kmph, and the speed of the faster train is 45 kmph.

The key idea is to express any polynomial P(x) in terms of falling factorials x^{underline{i}}. 1. **Define the Falling Factorial:** For each non-negative integer i, let: [ x^{underline{i}} = x(x-1)cdots(x-i+1) ] where x^{underline{0}} = 1. 2. **Lemma Application:** Each polynomial P(x) with integer coefficients can be uniquely written in the form: [ P(x) = a_n x^{underline{n}} + cdots + a_1 x^{underline{1}} + a_0 x^{underline{0}} ] where a_n neq 0. 3. **Base Case for Induction:** For a polynomial of degree 0 (a constant), this representation is straightforward. 4. **Inductive Step:** If P(x) has degree m with leading coefficient c, then by matching the highest degree term, it follows that m = n and a_n = c. Subtracting c x^{underline{n}} from P(x) leaves a polynomial of degree less than n, to which the induction hypothesis can be applied. 5. **Range for Coefficients:** The polynomial must satisfy 0 le P(x) < 120 for x in {0,1,2,3,4,5}.

The total cost without the discount is: [ 50C + 50 times 7 ] Jordyn gets a 10% discount on this total cost. A 10% discount means Jordyn pays 90% of the total cost.

Lévy, we will follow the suggested steps in the provided scheme. 1. **Step 1 (Establishment within space mathscr{B}):** Consider the class mathscr{B} of all closed sets B on S_n such that mu(F)=mu(B) and for all varepsilon > 0, mu(F^varepsilon) geq mu(B^varepsilon). We need to find a set M with the maximum measure of intersection with C. Let B_k in mathscr{B}, for k geq 1, such that lim_{k to infty} mu(B_k cap C) = sup_{B in mathscr{B}} mu(B cap C). 2. **Step 2 (Compactness and Separable Metric Space Argument):** Given that (S_n, rho_n) is a compact and separable metric space, by properties (d) and (f) in the problem II.1.30, there exists a subsequence (B_l) subseteq (B_k) such that B_l to B_0 := [lim] B_l in the Hausdorff metric d. 3. **Step 3 (Fatou’s Lemma Application):** By Fatou’s lemma and the properties of the limit superior, sup_{B in mathscr{B}} mu(B cap C) = lim_{l to infty} mu(B_l cap C) leq muleft(overline{lim} (B_l cap C)right) = muleft(C cap overline{lim} B_lright) leq mu(B_0 cap C). 4. **Step 4 (Verification of B_0 as M):** Verify that B_0 is indeed M. By the definition of convergence in the Hausdorff metric, for all delta, varepsilon > 0, starting from some l we have B_0^varepsilon subseteq B_l^{varepsilon + delta}. Thus, mu(F^{varepsilon + delta}) geq mu(B_0^varepsilon). As delta is arbitrary, B_0 in mathscr{B} and therefore M = B_0. 5. **Step 5 (The *-Transformation of Borel Set):** Consider the *-transformation of a Borel set B subseteq S_n relative to hyperplane H, passing through the center of S_n and dividing S_n into two parts. Take all points of B lying in the first part of the sphere, and reflect those that after transformation do not lie in B, into the second part.

Find points x in B setminus C and y in C setminus B such that: mu(B_* cap C) > mu(B cap C), where B_* is obtained via *-transformation relative to a hyperplane perpendicular to the segment with endpoints x, y. 8. **Step 8 (Conclusion by Measure Increase):** Any such transformation will ensure mu(B_* cap C) > mu(B cap C). The closure of B_* remains within mathscr{B}. Hence, M = C. 9. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we have established that for any closed set F subseteq S_n with mu(F) > 0 and all varepsilon > 0, mu(F^varepsilon) geq mu(C^varepsilon).

First, Suna traveled 7/15 of the total distance by train, so the distance traveled by train is (7/15) * D. The remaining distance after the train ride is D - (7/15) * D. To simplify this, we find a common denominator, which is 15, so we can write D as (15/15) * D. Now we subtract the train distance from the total distance: Remaining distance after train = (15/15) * D - (7/15) * D = (15/15 - 7/15) * D = (8/15) * D Next, Suna traveled 5/8 of this remaining distance by bus, so the distance traveled by bus is (5/8) * (8/15) * D. The remaining distance after the bus ride is (8/15) * D - (5/8) * (8/15) * D. To simplify this, we find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 8, so we can write (8/15) * D as (8/8) * (8/15) * D. Now we subtract the bus distance from the remaining distance after the train: Remaining distance after bus = (8/8) * (8/15) * D - (5/8) * (8/15) * D = ((8 - 5)/8) * (8/15) * D = (3/8) * (8/15) * D = (3/15) * D = (1/5) * D Then, Suna traveled 2/3 of this new remaining distance by taxi, so the distance traveled by taxi is (2/3) * (1/5) * D. The remaining distance after the taxi ride is (1/5) * D - (2/3) * (1/5) * D. To simplify this, we find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 3, so we can write (1/5) * D as (3/3) * (1/5) * D. Now we subtract the taxi distance from the remaining distance after the bus: Remaining distance after taxi = (3/3) * (1/5) * D - (2/3) * (1/5) * D = ((3 - 2)/3) * (1/5) * D = (1/3) * (1/5) * D = (1/15) * D We are given that the remaining distance after the taxi ride, which is (1/15) * D, is 2.6 km.

Calculating these values: For the maximum value at x = 4, f(4) = 2^4 - 4 = 16 - 4 = boxed{12} For the minimum value at x = -2, f(-2) = 2^{-2} - 4 = frac{1}{2^2} - 4 = frac{1}{4} - 4 = -frac{16}{4} + frac{1}{4} = -frac{15}{4} = boxed{-frac{15}{4}}"},{"prompt":"Given the lines of the two nonparallel sides of a trapezoid, the endpoints of one of its diagonals, and the direction of the other diagonal. Construct the trapezoid.","completion":"1. **Identification of Points and Lines:** Assume that the two lines given as the legs of the trapezoid meet at a point O. Let the endpoints of one of the diagonals be E and F, with E and F given. 2. **Drawing Parallel Lines:** Draw a line through point E parallel to the direction given by the other diagonal. Let this parallel line intersect the line OF at point P. 3. **Using the Intercept Theorem:** According to the Intercept Theorem (or the theorem of parallel transversals): [ frac{OG}{OF} = frac{OE}{OH} quad text{and} quad frac{OP}{OG} = frac{OE}{OH} ] Here, G is a point on OF and H is a point on OE. 4. **Solving for Segment OG:** From the intercept theorem equations, we get: [ OG = sqrt{OP cdot OF} ] This equation tells us that OG is the geometric mean of OP and OF. 5. **Constructing OG Geometrically:** To construct OG, use the property of the geometric mean in right triangles. Specifically, construct a right triangle where OG is the leg and OP and OF are the segments of the hypotenuse created by dropping a perpendicular from G to the hypotenuse. 6. **Verification and Uniqueness:** The construction is unique as long as P neq F neq O. If the lines representing the sides of the trapezoid do not intersect, then the trapezoid is a parallelogram. The given direction of the diagonal will intersect the midpoints of EF, enabling the construction of the other two vertices, provided that the given direction of the diagonal is not parallel to either the sides of the trapezoid or the direction of the other diagonal. 7. **Special Note on Parallelograms:** If the lines of the legs do not intersect, by drawing a parallel through the midpoint of EF in the direction of the given diagonal, the intersection with extension lines will determine the other vertices of the trapezoid parallel sides. In conclusion, regardless of whether the trapezoid is an ordinary trapezoid or a parallelogram, the method described will always yield a unique solution. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"bel: Josh is innocent Genotan: Tegan is guilty Josh: Genotan is guilty Tegan: Isobel is innocent Only the guilty person is lying; all the others are telling the truth.

The net change in the price is 24%. What was the percentage increase in the price after the initial decrease?","completion":"Let's assume the original price of the TV is P. After the first decrease of 20%, the new price is: P_{new1} = P - 0.20P = 0.80P Let's say the price is then increased by x% to give a final price P_{final}. The increase is x% of the new price P_{new1}, so the increase in price is: Increase = frac{x}{100} cdot 0.80P The final price after the increase is: P_{final} = P_{new1} + Increase = 0.80P + frac{x}{100} cdot 0.80P We are given that the net change in the price is a 24% increase, so: P_{final} = P + 0.24P = 1.24P Substituting the expression for P_{final} from above, we get: 0.80P + frac{x}{100} cdot 0.80P = 1.24P Now, we can solve for x: 0.80P(1 + frac{x}{100}) = 1.24P Divide both sides by 0.80P to isolate the term with x: 1 + frac{x}{100} = frac{1.24P}{0.80P} Simplify the right side: 1 + frac{x}{100} = 1.55 Subtract 1 from both sides to solve for frac{x}{100}: frac{x}{100} = 1.55 - 1 frac{x}{100} = 0.55 Multiply both sides by 100 to solve for x: x = 0.55 times 100 x = 55 So, the percentage increase in the price after the initial decrease was boxed{55%} ."},{"prompt":"Triangle ( ABC ) has ( BC = 24 ).

Let's begin by establishing the problem geometry. We have two right-angled triangles, ( Delta ABC ) and ( Delta ABD ), which share a common hypotenuse ( AB ). Triangle ( Delta ABC ) is isosceles and right-angled, while ( Delta ABD ) is just right-angled. Point ( C ) and point ( D ) are positioned on the same side of the line ( AB ). 2. The point ( D ) is such that ( DK ) is the angle bisector of ( Delta ABD ). 3. We need to prove that the center of the circumscribed circle around ( Delta ACK ) lies on the line ( AD ). 4. Assume the lines ( AD ) and ( BC ) intersect at point ( E ). 5. Because ( Delta ABC ) is an isosceles right-angled triangle, we know that ( angle ACB = angle ABC = 45^circ ). 6. Notice that ( angle ADK = 45^circ ) (as given) and ( angle EBK = 45^circ ). Hence, points ( B, E, D, K ) lie on the same circle (this follows from the Inscribed Angle Theorem which states that angles subtended by the same arc are equal). 7. Since ( angle BDE = 90^circ ), it follows that ( D ) is the orthocenter of the group of points ( B, E, K ). 8. Similarly, ( angle BKE = 90^circ ) implies that the segment ( AE ) is observed from points ( C ) and ( K ) at a right angle, meaning ( AE ) is a diameter of the circumscribed circle around the triangle ( ACK ). 9. From this, it follows directly that the center of the circle circumscribing ( Delta ACK ) is the midpoint of ( AE ). 10. Since ( E ) lies on ( AD ) by construction, and the center of the circle is the midpoint of ( AE ), it naturally follows that this center also lies on ( AD ).
