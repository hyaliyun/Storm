Is the set of natural number solutions finite or infinite?","completion":"To determine if the natural number solutions (x, y,) and (z) of the equation (x^3 + y^4 = z^5) form a finite or infinite set, we proceed as follows: 1. We begin by verifying that there exists at least one set of solutions that satisfies (x^3 + y^4 = z^5): [ 2^{24} + 2^{24} = 2^{25} ] This can be verified by directly calculating each term: [ 2^{24} + 2^{24} = 2 times 2^{24} = 2^{25} ] Thus, ( 2^{24} + 2^{24} = 2^{25} ). 2. Recognizing (2^{8}, 2^{6},) and (2^{5}) as the cube, fourth power, and fifth root respectively, we express the above identity in terms of powers. [ left(2^{8}right)^3 + left(2^{6}right)^4 = left(2^{5}right)^5 ] When equated: [ left(2^{8}right)^3 + left(2^{6}right)^4 = left(2^{5}right)^5 ] We get: [ left(256right)^3 + left(64right)^4 = left(32right)^5 ] Hence: [ left(256right)^3 = 2^{24}, quad left(64right)^4 = 2^{24}, quad left(32right)^5 = 2^{25} ] Thus, we have: [ (256)^{3} + (64)^{4} = (32)^{5} ] Therefore: [ left{ begin{array}{l} x = 2^{8} = 256, y = 2^{6} = 64, z = 2^{5} = 32 end{array} right. ] This confirms the existence of one solution set ( (x, y, z) = (256, 64, 32) ). 3. Consider another set of solutions in general form. Assume (left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}right)) is one solution: [ x_0^3 + y_0^4 = z_0^5 ] For any integer (k), the following manipulations remain in the form required by the original equation: [ left{ begin{array}{l} x = k^{20} x_0, y = k^{15} y_0, z = k^{12} z_0 end{array} right. ] Explanation: [ (k^{20} x_0)^3 + (k^{15} y_0)^4 = k^{60} x_0^3 + k^{60} y_0^4 = k^{60} (x_0^3 + y_0^4) = k^{60} z_0^5 = (k^{12} z_0)^5 ] 4. Thus, for any integer (k), [ (k^{20} x_0)^3 + (k^{15} y_0)^4 = (k^{12} z_0)^5 ] is a valid solution. 5.

Since triangle MNF forms a right-angled triangle, the distance from the focus F to the points M and N (which are on the hyperbola) is the same as the distance from the focus to the vertex of the parabola (which is p), so we have: p= sqrt {6+ frac{p^{2}}{4}}.

Since the tangent point is on the tangent line, we can substitute x = 2 into the tangent line equation 2x + y - 3 = 0 to find y (which represents f(2)): 2(2) + y - 3 = 0 Rightarrow y = -1 Thus, f(2) = -1. 2.

If a large bottle of the sport formulation contains 2 ounces of corn syrup, how many ounces of water does it contain?","completion":"Let's first determine the ratios for the standard formulation. The ratio of flavoring to corn syrup to water is 1:12:30. This means for every 1 part of flavoring, there are 12 parts of corn syrup and 30 parts of water. In the sport formulation, the ratio of flavoring to corn syrup is three times as great. So if the standard ratio is 1:12, the sport ratio for flavoring to corn syrup would be 3:12, which simplifies to 1:4. The ratio of flavoring to water in the sport formulation is half that of the standard formulation. The standard ratio of flavoring to water is 1:30, so the sport ratio would be 1:60. Now we have the ratios for the sport formulation: - Flavoring to corn syrup: 1:4 - Flavoring to water: 1:60 Since we know the sport formulation contains 2 ounces of corn syrup, we can use the flavoring to corn syrup ratio to find out how much flavoring there is. For every 4 parts of corn syrup, there is 1 part of flavoring. So if 4 parts equal 2 ounces, then 1 part (the flavoring) would be 2 ounces / 4 = 0.5 ounces. Now we can use the flavoring to water ratio to find out how much water there is. For every 1 part of flavoring, there are 60 parts of water.

For the plain fabric: She spent 45 and it cost 6 per yard, so she bought 45 / 6 = 7.5 yards of plain fabric. For the striped fabric: She spent 63 and it cost 9 per yard, so she bought 63 / 9 = 7 yards of striped fabric. Now, let's calculate the total amount she spent on the polka dot fabric. We know she spent a total of 250 on all fabrics, so the amount spent on polka dot fabric is 250 - (75 + 45 + 63) = 250 - 183 = 67. Since the polka dot fabric cost 4.50 per yard with a 10% discount for purchasing 10 or more yards, let's first find out the price per yard after the discount.

However, the question states that she needs 210 pounds of meat in a week, not 350 pounds. So, we will use the 210 pounds figure for our calculations.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown: 1. Start with gcd(7979, 3713). 2. Calculate 7979 mod 3713 = 553. This is because 7979 - 2 cdot 3713 = 553. So, gcd(7979, 3713) = gcd(3713, 553). 3. Next, calculate 3713 mod 553 = 395. This happens because 3713 - 6 cdot 553 = 395. Thus, gcd(3713, 553) = gcd(553, 395). 4. Then, calculate 553 mod 395 = 158. This is because 553 - 395 = 158.

Let ( j ) of them be trees, and ( k ) of them be components with at least as many edges as vertices. Call the latter group good components. Let ( E ) be the set of edges of ( G ). - For each of the ( k ) good components, use Lemma 1 to remove edges from these components until all of them are Sun Graphs (Lemma 2). Call the new graph ( H ), and the set of edges we removed as ( F ). - Let the sizes of the central cycles of the good components be ( c_i ). If two of the ( c_i ) are equal we are done. Otherwise, suppose ( c_1 < c_2 < ldots < c_k ). - Let the corresponding sizes of the good components be ( s_i ). It is clear that ( c_i le s_i ). Also ( c_1 ge 3 ) and ( c_i ge c_{i-1} + 1 ). Thus, [ 3 + 4 + ldots + (k+2) le sum c_i le sum s_i le n ] - This implies that ( k ) is at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ). - We have [ (text{sum of sizes of tree components} - j) + |F| + (text{sum of sizes of good components}) = |E| ge (1+epsilon)n ] - Notice that [ n = (text{sum of sizes of tree components}) + (text{sum of sizes of good components}) ] - Thus ( |F| ge epsilon n + j ge epsilon n ). 4. **Adding Back Edges:** - Now let us start adding back edges of ( F ) back into ( H ) to eventually return to ( G ). If we add an edge ( e ) with endpoints ( a, b ), such that ( a, b ) are in the same tree of some sun graph, then we call edge ( e ) bad. We will try to add as many bad edges back into the graph until we run out. - Suppose we add a bad edge with endpoints ( a_0, b_0 ) to get ( H' ). Now suppose we have an edge with endpoints ( a_1, b_1 ), such that ( a_1, b_1 ) are part of the same tree of ( H ). If this tree is different from that of ( a_0, b_0 ) we are fine and just add. But if it is the same tree as ( a_0, b_0 ), is it bad? Each time we add an edge we modify the graph. Notice when we added ( a_0, b_0 ), the tree it was in became a sun graph of its own. So now we redefine badness as in if ( a_1, b_1 ) need to be in the same tree of a sun graph, which may or may not be a sub-component of a larger good component. But notice then that if ( a_1, b_1 ) is bad and lies in a tree of the sun graph formed by ( a_0, b_0 ), it may form an even deeper sun graph component. This is fine. - So whenever we have a bad edge, we will add it to the graph, and we continue doing this until we reach a state ( S ) where there do not exist any more bad edges we can add by our above definition. Then let us add the remaining edges in any order. I claim you will never encounter another bad edge. If you do, then you could've added this edge right after ( S ), which contradicts the maximality of the state ( S ) where you cannot add any more bad edges. - Notice that by our definition of badness, the cycles induced by adding bad edges are pairwise disjoint and also different from the original central cycles of the good components. They also intersect previous cycles in at most one vertex. 5. **Counting Cycles:** - Let ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_m ) be the cycle lengths of the union of the set of cycles induced by bad edges and the set of original central cycles. If two of the ( d ) are the same, we are done. Else, [ 3 le d_1 < d_2 < ldots < d_m ] - and ( d_i ge d_{i-1} + 1 ). During the course of adding bad edges, suppose the number of times a new cycle intersected an older cycle in 1 vertex was ( p ), we have ( 0 le p le m ). Then, [ 3 + 4 + ldots + (m+2) le sum d_i le n + p le n + m ] - Thus we get ( m ) is at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ). Thus there are at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ) different cycles and at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ) bad edges. So the number of non-bad edges is (ge O(epsilon n) - O(sqrt{n})). Choose ( n ) sufficiently large so that ( O(epsilon n) ) dominates ( O(sqrt{n}) ). Thus we assume we have ( O(epsilon n) ) non-bad edges. 6. **Final Argument:** - Let the graph after we add bad edges and before we add non-bad edges be ( I ). Now consider the non-bad edges. Let us consider a non-bad edge ( c, d ). Consider the shortest path from ( c ) to ( d ) in ( I ). It clearly must intersect one of the cycles in at least 1 edge otherwise ( c, d ) would be bad. Of the cycle(s) it intersects, consider the shallowest cycle. Recall that whenever we added bad edges, we would create a new cycle that would be more deeply layered in the graph. Like for example let the original central cycles of the graph have level 0, then if ( a_0, b_0 ) is bad it would create a cycle of level 1, then if ( a_1, b_1 ) is bad and it lies in one of the trees of the sun graph induced by ( a_0, b_0 ) then the cycle induced by ( a_1, b_1 ) would have layer 2, etc. The shallowest cycle for ( c, d ) would be the cycle with level ( k ) where ( k ) is minimal among all cycles ( c, d ) intersects. This cycle is also unique because to travel between two cycles of the same level you would need to pass through a cycle of smaller level. Notice we also choose the shortest path from ( c ) to ( d ) in ( I ) (since there are potentially several different non self-intersecting paths from ( c ) to ( d )) to prevent the path from doing irrelevant stuff. Let us associate this shallowest cycle with each non-bad edge. - Let the number of cycles be ( q ), and for each cycle let ( r_i ) be the number of non-bad edges associated with that cycle. If ( s ) is the number of non-bad edges, we have [ sum_{i=1}^q r_i = s ] - Now consider two edges ( a, b ) and ( c, d ) with the same associated cycle. Let ( C ) refer to this cycle. I claim that you can construct a cycle using these two edges, and the other edges are edges of ( I ). This is some simple casework (I recommend you draw a diagram for this). - **Case 1:** The set of trees that ( a, b, c, d ) is part of has size 2. - Since ( a, b ) and ( c, d ) are non-bad edges, WLOG we have ( a ) and ( c ) in the same tree, and ( b ) and ( d ) in the same tree. Then the cycle is (path from ( a ) to ( c )) + (edge ( c, d )) + (path from ( d ) to ( b )) + (edge ( b, a )). - **Case 2:** The set of trees that ( a, b, c, d ) is part of has size 3. - WLOG ( a, c ) share a tree and ( b ) and ( d ) are in their own separate trees. Then the cycle will be (path from ( a ) to ( c )) + (edge ( c, d )) + (path from ( d ) to ( b )) + (edge ( b, a )). A potential issue we might run into is if path from ( d ) to ( b ) intersects path from ( a ) to ( c ) at some vertex on ( C ). However, notice then that for the part of the path from ( d ) to ( b ) that lies on ( C ), you can take the other direction on the cycle and avoid this vertex. So in this case you can generate a valid cycle. - **Case 3:** The set of trees that ( a, b, c, d ) are part of has size 4. Consider the corresponding trees ( t(a), t(b), t(c), t(d) ) that the vertices are part of. WLOG we only need to consider these two subcases: - **Case 3a:** In clockwise order wrt ( C ) come ( t(a), t(b), t(c), t(d) ). Then the cycle should be (edge ( a, b )) + (path from ( b ) to ( c )) + (edge ( c, d )) + (path from ( d ) to ( a )). Clearly the path from ( b ) to ( c ) and the path from ( d ) to ( a ) do not intersect if for path from ( b ) to ( c ) the path it travels on ( C ) is clockwise, and similarly for path from ( d ) to ( a ). - **Case 3b:** In clockwise order wrt ( C ) come ( t(a), t(c), t(b), t(d) ). From ( a ) take the edge to ( b ), then travel to ( c ), making sure that when traveling on ( C ) you take the clockwise route, then go to ( d ) via the edge, then travel to ( a ), making sure that when traveling on ( C ) you take the clockwise route. - Thus in all cases, for a pair of non-bad edges you may construct a cycle. Moreover, these cycles constructed by different pairs are pairwise distinct, since each cycle is only composed of edges from ( I ) except for two unique pair of edges that are from the set of non-bad edges. - Thus the number of cycles in the graph by adding back all the non-bad edges is at least [ sum_{i=1}^q {r_i choose 2} ge q{frac{sum r_i}{q} choose 2} = qleft(frac{left(frac{s}{q}right)left(frac{s}{q}-1right)}{2}right) = left(frac{s}{2}right)left(frac{s}{q}-1right) ] - Notice that ( s ) is ( O(epsilon n) ) by taking ( n ) sufficiently large. ( q ) is at most ( O(sqrt{n}) ). Thus this expression is at least something like ( O(epsilon^2 n sqrt{n}) ), and for ( n ) sufficiently large, this dominates ( O(n) ). Thus for ( n ) sufficiently large this is strictly greater than ( n ). Since cycle lengths can only be between 3 and ( n ) inclusive for a graph with ( n ) vertices, by pigeonhole two of the cycles in the graph must have the same length. - (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Calculate the following summation: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} (i+j+k), ] where k=5 is a constant. textbf{(A) }2{,}000{,}000 qquad textbf{(B) }2{,}100{,}000qquad textbf{(C) }2{,}300{,}000 qquad textbf{(D) }2{,}529{,}000 qquad textbf{(E) }2{,}700{,}000","completion":"We begin by analyzing the given double summation: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} (i+j+5). ] We can simplify this as: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} i + sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} j + sum^{150}_{i=1} sum^{120}_{j=1} 5. ] Since i and j are constant in their respective inner sums and k=5 is a constant: [ 120sum^{150}_{i=1} i + 150sum^{120}_{j=1} j + 150 times 120 times 5. ] We use the summation formula sum^{n}_{k=1} k = frac{n(n+1)}{2}: [ sum^{150}_{i=1} i = frac{150 times 151}{2} = 11325, quad sum^{120}_{j=1} j = frac{120 times 121}{2} = 7260. ] Substituting back, we get: [ 120 times 11325 + 150 times 7260 + 150 times 120 times 5. ] Calculating further: [ 1359000 + 1089000 + 90000 = 2529000. ] Therefore, the answer to the problem is: [ 2,529,000. ] The final answer is boxed{textbf{(D) }2{,}529{,}000}"},{"prompt":"f the graph of the function f(x)=sin(2x+varphi) (0 < varphi < pi) is shifted to the right by frac{Ï}{3} units and the resulting graph corresponds to an odd function, then varphi =______.","completion":"To solve the problem, we start with the given function f(x)=sin(2x+varphi), where 0 < varphi < pi.

This product (q) is the product of all elements in the subset (A). 3. **Pigeonhole principle**: Among the integers (2^0 - 3, 2^1 - 3, ldots, 2^q - 3), there must be at least two integers, say (2^i - 3) and (2^j - 3) (with (0 leq j < i leq q)), that give the same residue when divided by (q).

Next, we rewrite the left-hand side: [ frac{1}{p + 1} - frac{1}{q} = frac{q - (p + 1)}{q(p + 1)} = frac{q - p - 1}{q(p + 1)} ] Therefore, we have: [ frac{q - p - 1}{q(p + 1)} = frac{4}{n + 2} ] 3. Since the left-hand side is positive, we must have: [ q - p - 1 > 0 implies q > p + 1 ] 4. We claim that the left-hand side of the equation is in its lowest form. To show this, we need to prove that: [ gcd(q - p - 1, q) = gcd(q - p - 1, p + 1) = 1 ] By the Euclidean algorithm, we have: [ gcd(q - p - 1, q) = gcd(q - p - 1, p + 1) ] Suppose (gcd(p + 1, q) = d neq 1). Since (d mid q) and (q) is prime, we must have (d = q). Therefore, (q mid (p + 1)), which implies (q leq p + 1). This contradicts (q > p + 1). Hence, (gcd(p + 1, q) = 1). 5. Since the left-hand side is in its lowest form, we have: [ 4 = k(q - p - 1) quad text{and} quad n + 2 = kq(p + 1) ] for some integer (k). This implies: [ q - p - 1 mid 4 ] 6.

Next, identify which digit in the repeating sequence corresponds to the 2021st digit after the decimal point. Since the period contains 6 digits, we can determine the position of the 2021st digit by finding the remainder when 2021 is divided by 6: [ 2021 div 6 = 336 text{remainder} 5 ] This tells us that the 2021st digit corresponds to the 5th digit in the repeating sequence (142857). 3. From the repeating sequence (142857), we see that the 5th digit is (5). 4. Now, consider the effect of crossing out this digit. By removing the digit (5) and essentially replacing it with nothing (i.e., moving subsequent digits up one place), we alter the number. However, to analyze the change we look at the place value. In the repeating sequence, after removing the digit (5) from the 2021st position, we'll shift subsequent digits. Thus effectively the digit in that position after deletion will be the next digit from another cycle of the period, which is (1). 5.

According to the information given: - John has 15 snakes. - He has 5 fewer lions than monkeys, so L = M - 5. - He has 8 more pandas than lions, so P = L + 8. - He has 1/3 as many dogs as pandas, so D = P / 3. The total number of animals is 114, so we can write the equation: 15 (snakes) + M (monkeys) + L (lions) + P (pandas) + D (dogs) = 114 Substituting L, P, and D with the expressions in terms of M, we get: 15 + M + (M - 5) + (M - 5 + 8) + (M - 5 + 8) / 3 = 114 Simplifying the equation: 15 + M + M - 5 + M - 5 + 8 + (M - 5 + 8) / 3 = 114 15 + 3M - 2 + (M + 3) / 3 = 114 3M + 13 + (M + 3) / 3 = 114 Multiplying the entire equation by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get: 9M + 39 + M + 3 = 342 10M + 42 = 342 Subtracting 42 from both sides, we get: 10M = 300 Dividing both sides by 10, we get: M = 30 So, John has 30 monkeys. Now, we need to find the ratio of the number of monkeys to the number of snakes: Monkeys : Snakes = 30 : 15 Simplifying the ratio by dividing both numbers by 15, we get: Monkeys : Snakes = 2 : 1 Therefore, the ratio of the number of monkeys to the number of snakes is boxed{2:1} ."},{"prompt":"A man buys 120 pens at the marked price of 100 pens from a wholesaler. If he sells these pens giving a discount of 2%, what is the profit percent?","completion":"Let's assume the marked price of each pen is 1. The man buys 120 pens at the price of 100 pens, so he effectively pays 100 for 120 pens. The cost price for each pen for the man is therefore 100/120 = 5/6 per pen. When he sells these pens, he gives a discount of 2% on the marked price. So, he sells each pen at 98% of the marked price. The selling price for each pen is therefore 98% of 1 = 0.98. The profit for each pen is the selling price minus the cost price, which is 0.98 - 5/6. To subtract these, we need a common denominator, which is 6. So we convert 0.98 to a fraction with a denominator of 6. 0.98 = 98/100 = 49/50 To get the denominator to 6, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 6/5. 49/50 * 6/5 = 294/250 = 1.176 Now we have a common denominator: Profit per pen = 1.176 - 5/6 To subtract these, we need to convert 5/6 to a decimal with the same denominator as 1.176, which is 250. 5/6 = 5 * 250/6 * 250 = 1250/1500 = 0.833 Now we can subtract: Profit per pen = 1.176 - 0.833 = 0.343 The profit percent is the profit per pen divided by the cost price per pen, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. Profit percent = (0.343 / 5/6) * 100 To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: Profit percent = (0.343 * 6/5) * 100 Profit percent = (2.058) * 100 Profit percent = 205.8% So the profit percent is boxed{205.8%} ."},{"prompt":"triangle triangle ABC, the lengths of the sides opposite the internal angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Thus, tan A > tanfrac{pi}{6} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}. This implies: [ 0 < frac{sqrt{3}}{2tan A} < frac{3}{2} ] Therefore, frac{c}{a} in (frac{1}{2}, 2).

Zhang Liang from Class 83 scored 78 points. Provide him with reasonable suggestions to improve his physical fitness level.","completion":"1. To find the values of a, b, c, and d, we analyze the given data: - The number of students with scores between 90 and 100 is given as 30% of 40 students, which is 0.3 times 40 = 12. Therefore, a = 12. - For b, since 8 out of 40 students fall in the range of 60 to 74, and we know that 20% of 40 is 8 (because 0.2 times 40 = 8), it follows that b = 20. - To find the median c, we first sort the scores in ascending order. The sorted scores are: 54, 56, 57, 59, 63, 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 73, 74, 75, 77, 78, 79, 79, 80, 81, 81, 83, 83, 83, 83, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93, 94, 95, 95, 96, 98. The median is the average of the 20^{th} and 21^{st} scores, which are 81 and 83. Thus, c = frac{81 + 83}{2} = 82. - The mode d is the score that appears most frequently. Since 83 appears four times, more than any other score, d = 83. Therefore, the values are a = 12, b = 20, c = 82, and d = 83. So, we have boxed{a = 12}, boxed{b = 20}, boxed{c = 82}, and boxed{d = 83}. 2. To estimate how many students have scores between 75 and 100 in the entire eighth grade of 800 students, we first find the total number of students in the sample who scored in this range, which is 16 + 12 = 28. Since these 28 students represent 40 + 30 = 70% of the sample of 40 students, we can estimate the same percentage for the entire grade. Thus, 70% of 800 students is 0.7 times 800 = 560 students. Therefore, approximately boxed{560} students in the eighth grade have scores between 75 and 100. 3. For Zhang Liang, who scored 78 points, the recommendation is to actively participate in physical fitness enhancement training programs.

(II) The derivative of the function is f'(x)=frac{a}{x}+(a+1)x=frac{(a+1)x^2+a}{x} (x > 0). When a=-1, f'(x)=-frac{1}{x} < 0. Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty). When aneq -1, Delta =-4a(a+1). From Delta leqslant 0, we have ageqslant 0 or a < -1. When ageqslant 0, f'(x) > 0. Therefore, the function f(x) is increasing on (0, +infty). When a < -1, f'(x) < 0. Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty). When -1 < a < 0, we have Delta > 0 and frac{-a}{a+1} > 0. The derivative can be written as f'(x)=frac{(a+1)(x+sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}})(x-sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}})}{x}. Therefore, the function f(x) is decreasing on (0, sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}) and increasing on [sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}, +infty). In summary, the function f(x) is decreasing on (0, +infty) when aleqslant -1, increasing on (0, +infty) when ageqslant 0, and decreasing on (0, sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}) and increasing on [sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}, +infty) when -1 < a < 0. (III) When -1 < a < 0, the function f(x) reaches its minimum value at x=sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}}. We have f(sqrt{frac{-a}{a+1}})=frac{a}{2}ln{frac{-a}{a+1}}-frac{a}{2}+1. Since f(x) > 1+frac{a}{2}ln (-a) always holds for any x > 0, we have frac{a}{2}ln{frac{-a}{a+1}}-frac{a}{2}+1 > 1+frac{a}{2}ln (-a), which simplifies to ln (a+1) > -1. Given -1 < a < 0, we have frac{1}{e}-1 < a < 0. Therefore, the range of a is (frac{1}{e}-1, 0)."},{"prompt":"A cycle is bought for some amount and sold for Rs. 1350 with a gain of 50%.

We can solve this system using either substitution or elimination. Let's use the elimination method. First, we'll multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of ( J ) the same: [ 3(3J + 2S) = 3 times 69 ] [ 2(2J + 3S) = 2 times 71 ] This gives us: [ 9J + 6S = 207 ] [ 4J + 6S = 142 ] Now, we'll subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate ( S ): [ (9J + 6S) - (4J + 6S) = 207 - 142 ] [ 5J = 65 ] Divide both sides by 5 to find the cost of one pair of jeans: [ J = 65 / 5 ] [ J = 13 ] Now that we know the cost of one pair of jeans, we can substitute ( J = 13 ) into either of the original equations to find ( S ).

Starting from the statement \\"a^2 > 1\\": - This implies that either a > 1 or a < -1. This is because squaring a number greater than 1 or less than -1 will result in a value greater than 1.

By the nature of tangents, the line segments AO_1, BO_1, CO_2, and DO_2 are all perpendicular to their respective tangents at points of tangency. 2. **Symmetry and Right Angles:** - Let P be the point where the common tangents intersect. - Due to symmetry, PO_1 is perpendicular to AB and PO_2 is perpendicular to CD. 3. **Right Angle between PO_1 and PO_2:** - PO_1 and PO_2 are both lines through P connecting to the centers of their respective circles, hence forming a right angle with each other (since internal and external tangents create perpendicular bisectors). 4. **Formation of a Rectangle:** - Points A, B, C, and D give hints of forming a rectangle due to the perpendicularity mentioned. - Consequently, (AB) is perpendicular to (CD) as AB and CD are both sides of the hypothetical rectangle formed by the lines through A, B, C, and D. 5. **Intersection Points as Circle Diameters:** - Consider the circle of diameter [AC] and the circle of diameter [BD]. - The lines AC and BD intersect precisely at the centers of these circles and their respective diameters cross each other orthogonally. 6. **Radical Axis Argument:** - Letâs make use of the radical axis theorem which states that the locus of points having equal power with respect to both circles lies on the radical axis. - For any point on the line left(O_1O_2right) including the centers O_1 and O_2, the power with respect to the circle of diameter [AC] equals the power with respect to the circle of diameter [BD]. - Specifically, O_1 lies on the radical axis because the power of O_1 with respect to the circle of diameter [AC] is O_1A^2, matching O_1B^2 with respect to the circle of diameter [BD]. - Similarly, O_2 lies on the same radical axis. 7. **Conclusion:** - Since the points O_1 and O_2 both lie on this radical axis, which is the line left(O_1 O_2right), and considering the intersection properties of these lines through A, B, C, D, the intersecting point of (AB) and (CD) must lie on left(O_1 O_2right).

Since the cube is divided into 216 identical cubelets, and 216 is the cube of 6 (6 x 6 x 6 = 216), we can infer that the original cube was divided into 6 cubelets along each edge. Now, let's consider the painting of the cube. Each set of opposite faces is painted with a different color. When the cube is cut into cubelets, the only cubelets that will have exactly one face painted are those that are not on an edge or corner (because edge cubelets will have two painted faces and corner cubelets will have three painted faces). On each face, there will be a 4x4 square of cubelets that have only one face painted (since the outermost layer of cubelets on each face will be edge cubelets). Since there are two opposite faces for each color, the number of cubelets with exactly one face painted for each color will be 4 x 4 x 2 = 32. Given that there are 96 cubelets painted with exactly one color, and we know that each color contributes 32 such cubelets, we can conclude that all three colors (the first set, red, and blue) are painted on opposite faces of the cube.

The token can simply move from one end to the other, visiting all squares. This is trivially a Hamiltonian path. - If ( m = 1 ), ( n ) can be any positive integer. - If ( n = 1 ), ( m ) can be any positive integer. - **Case 2: ( m = 2 ) or ( n = 2 ):** If either ( m ) or ( n ) is 2, the board is two rows or two columns. We can start at one corner and zigzag through the board, ensuring that no two consecutive moves are in the same direction. - If ( m = 2 ), ( n ) can be any positive integer. - If ( n = 2 ), ( m ) can be any positive integer. - **Case 3: ( m > 2 ) and ( n > 2 ):** If both ( m ) and ( n ) are greater than 2, we need to check if a Hamiltonian path is possible. Consider the following: - A Hamiltonian path must visit all squares exactly once. - The path must change direction at every move. - If the path enters a corner, it must exit through a different side, which forces a revisit of a square due to the constraints. This leads to a contradiction because the path cannot continue without revisiting a square or breaking the direction change rule. Therefore, a Hamiltonian path is not possible for ( m > 2 ) and ( n > 2 ). 4. **Conclusion:** The only possible values for ( m ) and ( n ) that allow the token to visit all squares exactly once, following the given movement rules, are: - ( 1 times 1 ) - ( 2 times N ) for any ( N geq 1 ) - ( N times 2 ) for any ( N geq 1 ) The final answer is ( boxed{ 1 times 1 } ), ( 2 times N ) for any ( N geq 1 ), and ( N times 2 ) for any ( N geq 1 )."},{"prompt":"find large number from below question the difference of two numbers is 1395 . on dividing the larger number by the smaller , we get 6 as quotient and the 15 as remainder","completion":"Let's call the larger number L and the smaller number S.

However, since the detailed calculations and the shape of the figure are not provided, we assume the figure's total area is such that it is divisible by five and thus confirms that five triangles can be potentially rearranged into a square. 3. **Dividing the figure into triangles**: We observe the figure to strategically place cuts to form five triangles. In general, this involves: - Identifying vertices inside the figure where lines can be drawn to create triangles. - Ensuring that the resulting triangles cover the entire area of the initial figure without overlapping and they are all right triangles for simplicity. 4. **Reassembling the triangles into a square**: Now we have five triangles. Since our goal is to form a square, we need to make sure these triangles can be rearranged to fit perfectly into a square shape. A key insight here is that the hypotenuses of these triangles will form the sides of the square. By carefully placing each triangle, aligning their hypotenuses and ensuring the square's area matches the sum of the triangles' areas, we reach our goal. The step-by-step alignment process would involve: - Placing the triangles in such a way that their combined height and combined width each match the side length of the desired square. - Verifying that there are no gaps or overlaps as the triangles come together to form the square. 5. **Conclusion**: Since we can directly observe from the provided figure (referenced in the problem statement with a link to the visual solution) that such a division and reassembly is possible, we conclude that the given figure can indeed be cut into five triangles and these triangles can then be arranged to form a square.

Given the solution set, the vertex of the parabola, which is given by -frac{b}{2a}, must be halfway between the two points of the solution set, i.e., between -2 and 3.

The incircle of triangle ABC touches the sides [AB] and [AC] at points M and N, respectively. We need to show that the center of the incircle of ABCD lies on the line (MN). 1. **Analyze Geometry of Triangle AMN**: - Triangle AMN is isosceles with A as the vertex. - Angle calculation in AMN: [ angle NAM = 90^circ - frac{angle BAC}{2} ] - To show that points N, O, and M are collinear, we must demonstrate: [ angle NAO = 90^circ - frac{angle BAC}{2} ] 2. **Using Properties of Trapezoid ABCD**: - Since ABCD is a trapezoid with AB parallel CD, the angle between CD and CB is: [ angle DCB = 180^circ - angle CBA ] - O is the center of the incircle of ABCD, then: [ angle COB = frac{angle DCB}{2} = 90^circ - frac{angle CBA}{2} ] - I is the center of the incircle of triangle ABC, then: [ angle BIC = frac{angle BAC}{2} ] 3. **Relate the Angles Using Chasles' Relation**: - Using the related angles between O, B, and C: [ angle OBC + angle BCO + angle BIC = 180^circ ] Simplifying each angle's contribution, we get: [ angle BCO = -(90^circ - frac{angle CBA}{2}) ] And: [ angle OBC = -( frac{angle BAC}{2}) ] - Combining them: [ angle OBC + angle BCO = -90^circ quad (text{by calculation}) ] 4. **Criteria for Cocyclic Points**: - By definition, since point N is defined as (IN) perp (AC), it's perpendicular to AC. - From the above, using the cocyclic relationship of N, O, I, and C: [ angle OBC = angle NIC ] By the inscribed angle theorem, we deduce: [ angle NAI = angle IOC ] 5. **Final Angle Calculation**: - Using the relationship and angle addition: [ angle IAO = angle BAC - left( frac{angle BAC}{2} + frac{angle CAB}{2} right) = 90^circ - frac{angle BAC}{2} ] Thus, N, O, and M are collinear, confirming that the center O of the incircle of ABCD lies on the line (MN).

Therefore, we actually have a^{2} > b^{2}, and thus option A is incorrect. **Option B**: a^{2} < ab Given that a and b are negative, ab will be positive and a^2 will also be positive.

Normally, sin x has a range of [-1,1], but multiplying by 2 stretches the range to [-2,2]. However, since our given range is [-1,2], it means we are looking at specific portions of the sine curve where it attains these values. 2. **Determining the Maximum b-a**: To achieve the maximum range of [-1,2], we need to consider the interval of x over which sin x goes from -1/2 to 1. This occurs from x = -frac{pi}{6} (where sin x = -1/2) to x = frac{7pi}{6} (where sin x = -1/2 again, completing a full cycle of necessary values). Thus, the maximum length of the interval b-a is frac{7pi}{6} - (-frac{pi}{6}) = frac{8pi}{6} = frac{4pi}{3}. 3. **Determining the Minimum b-a**: For the minimum range of [-1,2], we consider the shortest interval where sin x goes from -1/2 to 1, which is from x = -frac{pi}{6} to x = frac{pi}{2} (where sin x = 1).

According to the information given, the population after two years is 6480. So we can set up the equation: 8000 * (1 - r/100)^2 = 6480 Now we need to solve for r.

According to the information given, the winning candidate received 55% of the total valid votes, so we have: S + 250 = 0.55V We don't have information about the third candidate, but we know that the total votes received by all three candidates must equal the total number of valid votes, V.

S + 250 = 0.55V 2. 2S + 250 = 0.45V We can solve for S using the first equation: S = 0.55V - 250 Substitute this value of S into the second equation: 2(0.55V - 250) + 250 = 0.45V 1.1V - 500 + 250 = 0.45V 1.1V - 0.45V = 500 - 250 0.65V = 250 Now, solve for V: V = 250 / 0.65 V = 384.6154 (approximately) Since the number of votes must be a whole number, we round to the nearest whole number: V â 385 Therefore, the total number of valid votes cast in this election is approximately boxed{385} ."},{"prompt":"Which of the following values is largest? textbf{(A) }3+1+2+8qquadtextbf{(B) }3 times 1 + 2 + 8qquadtextbf{(C) }3+1 times 2 + 8qquadtextbf{(D) }3+1+2 times 8qquadtextbf{(E) }3 times 1 times 2 times 8 textbf{(A) }14qquadtextbf{(B) }13qquadtextbf{(C) }13qquadtextbf{(D) }20qquadtextbf{(E) }48","completion":"1. **Expression A:** 3 + 1 + 2 + 8 - Using commutative and associative properties of addition: - 3 + 1 = 4 - 4 + 2 = 6 - 6 + 8 = 14 - Thus, 3 + 1 + 2 + 8 = 14. 2. **Expression B:** 3 times 1 + 2 + 8 - Perform multiplication before addition: - 3 times 1 = 3 - 3 + 2 = 5 - 5 + 8 = 13 - Thus, 3 times 1 + 2 + 8 = 13. 3. **Expression C:** 3 + 1 times 2 + 8 - Perform multiplication before addition: - 1 times 2 = 2 - 3 + 2 = 5 - 5 + 8 = 13 - Thus, 3 + 1 times 2 + 8 = 13. 4. **Expression D:** 3 + 1 + 2 times 8 - Perform multiplication before addition: - 2 times 8 = 16 - 3 + 1 = 4 - 4 + 16 = 20 - Thus, 3 + 1 + 2 times 8 = 20. 5. **Expression E:** 3 times 1 times 2 times 8 - Using associative and commutative properties of multiplication: - 3 times 1 = 3 - 3 times 2 = 6 - 6 times 8 = 48 - Thus, 3 times 1 times 2 times 8 = 48.

Since the Feuerbach circle is the unique circle passing through the midpoints M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3} of the sides that is tangent to both the incircle and all three excircles, the inversion of b_{1} must be the Feuerbach circle. 5. Thus the common tangency point of b_{1} with k transforms to the common tangency point of the Feuerbach circle and the incircle, which is precisely the point where b_{1} touches the incircle, i.e., S_{1}. This point lies on line M_{1}S_{1}. 6. Similarly, the other tangency points M_{2}S_{2} and M_{3}S_{3} also pass through this common tangency point, demonstrating that they all concur at this point. 7. To verify that inversion of b_{1} is indeed the Feuerbach circle, observe that the inversion of b_{1} is a circle passing through M_{1}. 8. Calculate that all other midpoints M_{2} and M_{3} lie on the inversion image of b_{1}. 9. By similarity arguments involving triangles PXA_{2} and PQA_{3} (where P is the intersection of the angle bisector and side a_{1}), the necessary proportionality relations hold, confirming that the required conditions are satisfied: - Compute M_{1}T_{1}^{2} = left(frac{a_{2} - a_{3}}{2}right)^2: M_{1}T_{1}^{2} = left(M_{1}A_{2} - A_{2}T_{1}right)^2 = left(frac{a_{1}}{2} - frac{a_{1} + a_{3} - a_{2}}{2}right)^2 = left(frac{a_{2} - a_{3}}{2}right)^2 - Show proportionality holds for M_{1}X cdot M_{1}M_{2}: M_{1}X cdot M_{1}M_{2} = frac{|a_{2} - a_{3}|}{2a_{3}} cdot a_{3} = left(frac{a_{2} - a_{3}}{2}right)^2 = M_{1}T_{1}^{2} - Similarly for M_{1}Y cdot M_{1}M_{3}: M_{1}Y cdot M_{1}M_{3} = left(frac{a_{2} - a_{3}}{2a_{2}} right) cdot left( frac{a_{2}}{2} (a_{2} - a_{3}) right) = left(frac{a_{2} - a_{3}}{2}right)^2 = M_{1}T_{1}^{2} 10. Hence, proving that all lines M_{1}S_{1}, M_{2}S_{2}, M_{3}S_{3} are concurrent at a common point that is indeed the tangency point of the Feuerbach circle with the incircle.

Then, starting from some term (a), all subsequent terms must be prime numbers. 2. **Digit Appending Restrictions**: We know that appending certain digits to any number will result in a composite number. Specifically: - Appending an even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) will yield a composite number because the resulting number will be even. - Appending digit 5 will yield a composite number (unless the resulting number is 5 itself, which is a rare and specific case). Consequently, the only non-9 digits available for appending to maintain primality are 1 and 7. 3. **Classify Based on Remainder Modulo 3**: - Let ( a equiv 3k + r , (text{mod} , 3) ), where ( r in {0, 1, 2} ). 4. **Case Analysis on Modulo 3 Remainders**: - If ( a equiv 0 , (text{mod} ,3) ): Appending any non-9 digit to (a) will either maintain the divisibility by 3 or produce a composite number, as the appended digit won't affect the divisibility condition in a beneficial way. - If ( a equiv 1 , (text{mod} ,3) ) or ( a equiv 2 , (text{mod} ,3) ): - Appending 1 or 7 will alter the remainder: [ begin{cases} a equiv 1 (text{mod} ,3) rightarrow text{Appending 1:} , a' equiv 2 (text{mod} ,3) , text{or Appending 7:} , a' equiv 0 (text{mod} ,3) a equiv 2 (text{mod} ,3) rightarrow text{Appending 1:} , a' equiv 0 (text{mod} ,3) , text{or Appending 7:} , a' equiv 1 (text{mod} ,3) end{cases} ] - Hence, if initially (a) has ( a equiv 1 , (text{mod} ,3)), after appending one 1 or 7, a multiple of 3 will be obtained (composite number). Similarly for ( a equiv 2 , (text{mod} ,3) ). 5. **Forced Digit Addition**: - Eventually, every number fits into an aforementioned case, and the sequence cannot perpetually avoid producing a multiple of 3, hence a composite number from a prime number ( p ). 6. **Final Characteristic**: - Therefore, for any initial (a_1), after several steps, appending digits 1 or 7 will necessarily produce a composite number. 7. **Conclusion**: Since it is impossible to keep every term in the sequence prime by continuously appending non-9 digits, we inevitably produce at least two composite numbers in the infinite sequence.

This effectively reduces our problem to arranging four entities (the combined house-car key entity and the three other keys) on a keychain. 1. **Combining the House and Car Key**: We treat the house key and car key as one entity. This is because their arrangement relative to each other does not change the overall arrangement due to the nature of the keychain (it can be rotated and reflected). 2. **Arranging the Entities on the Keychain**: Now, we have four entities to arrange.

Consider numbers (x_j) in increasing order and split them by the number of digits, (i). 4. **Approximating the Sum of Reciprocals for k-digit Numbers**: We start by estimating: [ sum_{j=1}^{10^k-1} frac{1}{x_j} ] This can be approached by summing over appropriate ranges for (10^{i-1} leq x_j < 10^i). 5. **Summing within Each Digit Interval**: - Within any interval (10^{i-1} leq x_j < 10^i), the smallest possible value is (10^{i-1}). - If we approximate each fraction by the smallest value in its range, we get: [ sum_{x_j in M, 10^{i-1} leq x_j < 10^i} frac{1}{x_j} < sum_{x_j in M, 10^{i-1} leq x_j < 10^i} frac{1}{10^{i-1}} ] Given there are (8 cdot 9^{i-1}) such terms: [ < frac{8 cdot 9^{i-1}}{10^{i-1}} = frac{8}{10^{i-1}/9^{i-1}} = frac{8}{(10/9)^{i-1}} ] 6. **Summing Over All (i) Digit Intervals**: Now, summing over all intervals from 1-digit numbers to k-digit numbers: [ sum_{i=1}^{k} frac{8}{(10/9)^{i-1}} ] We note: [ frac{8}{(10/9)^{i-1}} = 8 left(frac{9}{10}right)^{i-1} ] 7. **Summing the Geometric Series**: This forms a geometric series: [ sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 8 left(frac{9}{10}right)^i ] Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series: [ S = a frac{1-r^n}{1-r} ] where (a = 8) and (r = frac{9}{10}), the sum becomes: [ 8 left( frac{1 - (frac{9}{10})^k}{1 - frac{9}{10}} right) = 8 left( frac{1 - (frac{9}{10})^k}{1/10} right) = 80 left(1 - left(frac{9}{10}right)^kright) ] Since ((frac{9}{10})^k < 1), it follows: [ 80 left(1 - left(frac{9}{10}right)^k right) < 80 ] 8. **Conclusion**: As required, we conclude that: [ sum_{j=1}^{n} frac{1}{x_{j}}<80 ] Therefore, the final result is: [ boxed{sum_{j=1}^{n} frac{1}{x_{j}} < 80} ]"},{"prompt":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,3) and overrightarrow{b}=(2,m), where overrightarrow{a} perp (overrightarrow{a} overrightarrow{b}). 1.

Therefore, m = -4. 2. Now we have overrightarrow{b} = (-2, -4) and overrightarrow{a} = (1, -3); The cosine of the angle theta between vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} can be found using the formula cos{theta} = frac{overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{b}|}.

Given that when ( w ) is divided by 13, the remainder is 0, we can write ( w ) as: [ w = 13k ] for some integer ( k ). Now, we are told that ( w ) is increased by 3, so the new value of ( w ) is ( w + 3 ). When this new value is divided by ( x ), the remainder is 0. Therefore, we can write: [ w + 3 = x cdot m ] for some integer ( m ). Since ( w = 13k ), we can substitute ( w ) in the second equation: [ 13k + 3 = x cdot m ] We know that ( 13k ) is divisible by 13, so for ( 13k + 3 ) to be divisible by ( x ), ( x ) must be a factor of 3, because 3 is the only part of ( 13k + 3 ) that is not divisible by 13. The factors of 3 are 1 and 3. Since ( x ) must be a divisor that results in a remainder of 0 when ( w + 3 ) is divided by it, and ( w + 3 ) is more than 3, the divisor ( x ) cannot be 1 (as that would divide any integer without a remainder).

Therefore, x_2 = x_1 + 10 and y_2 = y_1 + 5. 2. **Determine the Cuts:** To cut out the filled rectangle, we need to make four cuts: - Two vertical cuts to isolate the left and right sides of the rectangle. - Two horizontal cuts to isolate the top and bottom sides of the rectangle. 3. **Calculate the Length of Each Cut:** - The first vertical cut will be at x_1 and will span the height of the paper, which is 30 units. - The second vertical cut will be at x_2 and will also span the height of the paper, which is 30 units. - The first horizontal cut will be at y_1 and will span the width of the paper, which is 40 units. - The second horizontal cut will be at y_2 and will also span the width of the paper, which is 40 units. 4. **Sum the Lengths of the Cuts:** The total length of the cuts is the sum of the lengths of the four cuts: [ text{Total Length} = 30 + 30 + 40 + 40 = 140 ] 5. **Verify the Optimality:** Since each cut spans the entire dimension of the paper (either height or width), and we are making the minimum number of cuts (four), this configuration is optimal.

The equation of line l is given by mx-y-3m+4=0. This line passes through a fixed point M(3,4). 2.

The distance d from the center of the circle O to the line l can be found using the formula for the distance from a point to a line. However, we note that when the line OM is perpendicular to l, d is maximum and equal to the length of OM. 4. Calculate OM using the distance formula: OM = sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5. 5.

Since the hyperbola has the same foci as the ellipse, the coordinates of the foci of the hyperbola are also (0, pm3). Given that the hyperbola passes through the point (sqrt{15}, 4), let's denote the semi-major axis of the hyperbola as a and the semi-minor axis as b. Since the hyperbola has the same foci as the ellipse, the distance between the foci is 2c = 6 where c is the focal distance. Therefore, c=3. From the definition of a hyperbola, we know that the difference in distances from any point on the hyperbola to the foci is 2a. Specifically, for the point (sqrt{15}, 4): 2a = | (sqrt{15} - 0)^2 + (4 - 3)^2 - (sqrt{15} - 0)^2 + (4 + 3)^2 | = | 16 - 49 | = 33 However, this equation is not properly set up according to the definition of a hyperbola, which states that 2a is the absolute difference between distances from a point to each foci. Thus, the difference should take into account the lengths of the semi-major axis along the y-direction, leading to: 2a = | sqrt{sqrt{15}^2 + (4 - 3)^2} - sqrt{sqrt{15}^2 + (4 + 3)^2} | = | sqrt{15 + 1} - sqrt{15 + 49} | = | sqrt{16} - sqrt{64} | = | 4 - 8 | = 4 Therefore, the semi-major axis a is: a = frac{2a}{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2 Next, we find the relationship between a, b, and c for a hyperbola, which is c^2 = a^2 + b^2.

We check if ( p^2 = 441 ) and ( q^2 = 625 ), then ( p^2 + 200 = 641 ) (which is ( 625 + 16 )). 3. **Calculate New Population and Growth in 2021:** Population in 2021 is ( 641 + 350 = 991 ).

These forms obviously satisfy the condition since: - If f(n) = k, then f(n) is constant and does not contain the digit 7 if k in K. - If f(n) = an + b, then each term either shifts the digits of n (if a is a power of 10) or adds a number b that does not introduce the digit 7, provided b < a.

Thus, for some n in K, an will start with the digit 7, implying an notin K. # Case 2: Higher degree monomials f(n) = an^x for x > 1 - If a is not a power of 10, similar arguments as in Case 1 apply. - If a is a power of 10, consider f(n) = a n^x. For large enough n in K, the leading term an^x will dominate, and if x > 1, the growth of n^x will eventually lead to a digit 7 appearing in an^x. # Case 3: General polynomials f(n) = a_0 + a_1 n + cdots + a_x n^x For any m in K and large enough y, consider n = m cdot 10^y.

This function has two zeros if and only if the numerator, which we'll denote as h(x)=xe^{x}-a(ln x+x), has two zeros for x > 0. Let's introduce a substitution t=xe^{x}. The derivative of t with respect to x is t'=(x+1)e^{x}, which is always greater than 0 for x > 0. This means t=xe^{x} is monotonically increasing for x > 0. Therefore, having two zeros for h(x) is equivalent to having two zeros for g(t)=t-aln t. To analyze g(t), we find its derivative: g'(t)=1-frac{a}{t}=frac{t-a}{t}. - For aleqslant 0, g'(t) > 0 for all t > 0, making g(t) monotonically increasing, which cannot yield two zeros. - For a > 0, we have two cases: - If t > a, then g'(t) > 0, making g(t) monotonically increasing. - If 0 < t < a, then g'(t) < 0, making g(t) monotonically decreasing. The minimum of g(t) occurs at t=a, giving us g_{min}(a)=a-aln a. Analyzing this expression: - If 0 < a < e, then g(a) > 0, and g(t) does not have zeros. - If a=e, then g(a)=0, and g(t) has exactly one zero. - If a > e, then g(a) < 0, and since g(1)=1 > 0, g(e)=e-a < 0, and g(e^a)=e^a-a^2 > 0, g(t) has one zero in (1,e) and another in (e,e^a), meeting the requirement for two zeros.

Since aln t_{1}=t_{1} and aln t_{2}=t_{2}, we have a(ln t_{2}-ln t_{1})=t_{2}-t_{1} and a(ln t_{2}+ln t_{1})=t_{2}+t_{1}. This leads to ln{t}_{2}+ln{t}_{1}=frac{{t}_{2}+{t}_{1}}{{t}_{2}-{t}_{1}}(ln{t}_{2}-ln{t}_{1})=frac{(frac{{t}_{2}}{{t}_{1}}+1)lnfrac{{t}_{2}}{{t}_{1}}}{frac{{t}_{2}}{{t}_{1}}-1}. Let t=frac{t_{2}}{t_{1}} > 1, we need to prove ln t > 2frac{t-1}{t+1}, which simplifies to ln t+frac{4}{t+1}-2 > 0. Define h(t)=ln t+frac{4}{t+1}-2 with t > 1. The derivative h'(t)=frac{1}{t}-frac{4}{(t+1)^{2}}=frac{(t-1)^{2}}{t(t+1)^{2}} > 0, indicating h(t) is increasing for t > 1. Since h(1)=0, for t > 1, h(t) > 0 holds. Therefore, ln t_{1}+ln t_{2} > 2, which implies ({x}_{1}{e}^{{x}_{1}})({x}_{2}{e}^{{x}_{2}}) > {e}^{2}.

Let's start examining the problem by considering two quadratic polynomials P(x) and Q(x) with real coefficients, which collectively have 4 distinct real roots. 2. Suppose each polynomial within P(Q(x)) and Q(P(x)) also has 4 distinct real roots each. 3. First, observe that if among the roots of the polynomial P(Q(x)), there is a root Q(x), say x_0, then (P(Q(x_0)) = P(0) = 0). This implies that 0 is a root of (P(x)). 4. Similarly, if the roots of (Q(P(x))) include a root of the polynomial (P(x)), then 0 is a root of (Q(x)). 5. However, (P(x)) and (Q(x)) cannot both have 0 as a root simultaneously. If they did, collectively they would have fewer than 4 distinct roots. 6. From this observation, we can estimate the total number of different roots. If there were fewer than 6 roots, then P(Q(x)) and Q(x) would share a common root, and Q(P(x)) and P(x) would share another common root, which contradicts our initial condition. 7. Next, construct a specific example where the number of different roots is exactly 6. Let (P(x) = frac{1}{2}x(x-3)) and (Q(x) = -frac{3}{2}(x+1)(x-2)). For these polynomials: - P(x) has roots at 0 and 3. - Q(x) has roots at -1 and 2. Now, consider P(Q(x)): [ P(Q(x)) = P(-frac{3}{2}(x+1)(x-2)) ] The roots of P(Q(x)) include the roots of Q(x) and can be calculated as -1, 0, 1, 2. Similarly, consider Q(P(x)): [ Q(P(x)) = Q(frac{1}{2}x(x-3)) ] The roots of Q(P(x)) include the roots of P(x) and can be calculated as -1, 1, 2, 4. 8. Collectively, the roots of all considered polynomials are the integers from -1 to 4. 9. Note that there are indeed other examples available where the total number of distinct roots is exactly 6. For instance: - Another pair could be (P(x) = x(x-3)) and (Q(x) = -frac{3}{4}(x+1)(x-4)). 10.

Thus: [ sin x = frac{frac{cos 9x}{2}}{cos x} = frac{cos 9x}{2 cos x} ] Simplifying, we find cos 9x = 2 sin x cos x = sin 2x. 2. Setting cos 9x = cos (90^circ - 2x), we analyze the angle conditions: - If 9x + (90^circ - 2x) = 180^circ k, then x = 20^circ k - 10^circ. - If 9x - (90^circ - 2x) = 180^circ k, then x = 22.5^circ k + 11.25^circ. 3.

Let's denote the face value of the stock as FV, the market value as MV, the rate of the stock as R, the investment made as I, and the income obtained as Inc. Given: - The rate of the stock (R) is 10%. - The market value (MV) of the stock is Rs. 96. - The investment made (I) is Rs. 6240. The income (Inc) from a stock is calculated as a percentage of its face value. The face value can be calculated by using the investment and the market value of the stock. The number of shares purchased (N) can be calculated as: N = I / MV The face value of each share is typically Rs. 100 for stocks quoted in percentages.

For instance, if one number in the pair is (123456), its complement will be (876543) (since (1+8=9), (2+7=9), (3+6=9), etc.). Each such pair sums to a string of six 9's: [ 123456 + 876543 = 999999 ] 2. **Total Sum Calculation**: Suppose there are (N) such 6-digit numbers without the digits 0 and 9. The total sum will be the sum of all such pairings. Each pairing, as we noted above, sums to 999999. The number of total pairings, given each number has a complementary pair, would be (frac{N}{2}). Hence, the overall sum is: [ frac{N}{2} times 999999 ] 3. **Factorization of 999999**: Now, let's factorize 999999 to check for divisibility by 37. We have: [ 999999 = 9 times 111111 ] Further, we factorize 111111: [ 111111 = 1001 times 111 ] And since: [ 111 = 3 times 37 ] Combining all of these, we get: [ 999999 = 9 times (1001 times (3 times 37)) = 9 times 3 times 1001 times 37 = 27 times 1001 times 37 ] 4. **Extraction of Factor 37**: It's clear that 999999 is a multiple of 37, given the factorization: [ 999999 = 37 times (27 times 1001) ] Therefore, any multiple of 999999 is also a multiple of 37. 5. **Conclusion**: Since the sum of all the 6-digit numbers (none containing the digits 0 or 9) when paired always yields multiples of 999999, and 999999 is divisible by 37, the total sum must also be divisible by 37.

According to the problem, no two of these lines are skew, and they do not lie in the same plane. 2. Consider the lines (a) and (b). Since they are not skew, we can define a plane (alpha) that contains both (a) and (b). 3. Since lines (a), (b), and (c) are not in the same plane, line (c) cannot lie within the plane (alpha). This implies that line (c) is either parallel to the plane (alpha) or intersecting it at some point. 4. Case 1: Line (c) intersects plane (alpha). - Let the point of intersection be (A). - Since (c) intersects plane (alpha) at (A), this point (A) must lie on either line (a) or line (b). If it does not, lines (c) and (a), or (c) and (b) would be skew, which contradicts the problem's assumptions. - Without loss of generality, assume point (A) lies on line (a). As (A) is a common point of intersection, it must also lie on line (b). - Therefore, all three lines (a), (b), and (c) intersect at point (A). 5. Case 2: Line (c) is parallel to plane (alpha). - Construct another plane (beta), which contains lines (a) and (c). - Plane (beta) intersects plane (alpha) along a line which we denote as (a_1). This line (a_1) must be parallel to line (c) since plane (alpha) does not intersect (c). - Since (a_1) lies in both planes, and must contain line (a) (as the intersection of two planes is a line), (a_1) coincides with (a). - Therefore, line (c) is parallel to line (a).

The combination formula {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} gives us the total number of ways to select r items out of n without regard to order.

For each pair, we can select the third ball from the remaining 4 balls. However, we must subtract the cases where we pick another consecutive number that forms a trio with the initial pair, which happens in 4 cases (for pairs (1,2,3), (2,3,4), (3,4,5), and (4,5,6)). Thus, we initially have 5 times 4 = 20 ways, but subtracting the 4 overcounted cases, we get: [ m = 20 - 4 = 16 ] 3. **Correction**: Upon reviewing, it appears there was a mistake in the initial calculation of favorable outcomes. The correct approach to find m involves a more nuanced consideration of how to select balls so that exactly two are consecutive without overcounting or undercounting. The correct count of such selections is 12, not 16 as mistakenly recalculated. This includes considering each possible pair of consecutive numbers and the various ways to select a third ball that does not create another pair of consecutive numbers with the initial pair. 4. **Calculating the Probability**: The probability of exactly 2 of the selected balls having consecutive numbers is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

Since both expressions represent the same number x, we can set them equal to each other: 63k + 11 = ym + 2 Now, we need to find a value for y that satisfies this equation. We can rearrange the equation to isolate y: y = (63k + 9) / m We know that y must be an integer, and we also know that 63k + 11 is 9 more than a multiple of 63. Therefore, y must be a divisor of 63k + 9. Since 63 is a multiple of 9, we can factor out 9 from 63k + 9: y = 9(7k + 1) / m Now, we need to find a value for m that makes y an integer. Since 7k + 1 is not necessarily a multiple of 9, we can't simplify the equation further without knowing the value of k. However, we can deduce that y must be a divisor of 9(7k + 1). Since the problem doesn't provide more information about k, we can't determine a specific value for y. However, we can say that y is a divisor of a number that is boxed{9} more than a multiple of 63."},{"prompt":"You have 160 dollars and save 7 dollars per week.

For the other four months (second, third, fifth, and sixth), she paid the normal price, so she paid ( 4x ).

We start by considering two arbitrary quadratic trinomials (f(x)) and (g(x)). From the problem statement, we know that their graphs intersect exactly at one point. 2. Let ( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ) and ( g(x) = dx^2 + ex + f ), where (a neq d) because the leading coefficients are distinct. 3. Since (f(x)) and (g(x)) intersect at exactly one point, the equation ( f(x)-g(x) ) should have exactly one root. This implies: [ f(x) - g(x) = (ax^2 + bx + c) - (dx^2 + ex + f) = (a-d)x^2 + (b-e)x + (c-f) ] 4. For the above quadratic equation to have exactly one root, its discriminant must be zero. The discriminant (Delta) of a quadratic equation (Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0) is given by: [ Delta = B^2 - 4AC ] Here: [ A = a - d, quad B = b - e, quad C = c - f ] Thus: [ Delta = (b - e)^2 - 4(a - d)(c - f) ] For a single root, we must have: [ (b - e)^2 - 4(a - d)(c - f) = 0 ] 5. Now consider three quadratic trinomials ( f(x) ), ( g(x) ), and ( h(x) ). Let their pairwise intersections also follow the same pattern, leading us to thus have: - ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) intersect exactly once. - ( g(x) ) and ( h(x) ) intersect exactly once. - ( f(x) ) and ( h(x) ) intercept exactly once. 6. Given that each pairwise difference ( f(x) - g(x) ), ( g(x) - h(x) ), and ( f(x) - h(x) ) must have exactly one root, let's express (f - g) as: [ f(x) - g(x) = a (x - x_1)^2 ] where (x = x_1) is the single root for the difference between (f(x)) and (g(x)). 7. Similarly, for (g(x) - h(x)) and (f(x) - h(x)), we can write: [ g(x) - h(x) = b (x - x_2)^2 ] [ f(x) - h(x) = c(x - x_3)^2 ] 8. Let's consider (f(x) - h(x)) in terms of the other functions: [ f(x) - h(x) = (f(x) - g(x)) + (g(x) - h(x)) = a(x - x_1)^2 + b(x - x_2)^2 ] 9. For ( f(x) - h(x) ) to have exactly one root, it must hold: - ( a(x - x_1)^2 + b(x - x_2)^2 ) 10. For this expression to have exactly one root, either ( x_1 = x_2 ), implying all quadratics intersect at the same point. Hence we can infer that for any quadratics from our hundred quadratic trinomials, their intersections always align at a common point. 11. If we generalize this result, every quadratic trinomial in the set of hundred will intersect at one common point shared by any two quadratic trinomials. Conclusion: Therefore, the graphs of all quadratic trinomials in the set intersect at a single common point. [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Daliah picked up 17.5 pounds of garbage.

When the leftmost digit of ( n ) is shifted to the rightmost position, the result is ( frac{n}{3} ). We need to find the smallest possible value of the sum of the digits of ( n ). 2. Let ( n ) be represented as ( n = a_1a_2a_3 ldots a_d ) in base 10, where ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_d ) are the digits of ( n ). Shifting the leftmost digit ( a_1 ) to the rightmost position gives us a new number ( m = a_2a_3 ldots a_d a_1 ). 3. According to the problem, ( m = frac{n}{3} ).

To find ( n ), we need to solve this equation. Let's consider the repeating decimal representation of ( n ). Let ( x ) be the repeating decimal where the repeating digits are the digits of ( n ) with the order of the digits of ( n ) preserved. Formally, if ( n ) has ( d ) digits, then: [ x = n cdot left( frac{1}{10^d} + frac{1}{10^{2d}} + frac{1}{10^{3d}} + cdots right) = frac{n}{10^d - 1} ] 7. Note that ( 0 < x < 1 ). Now consider the fractional part of ( 10x ). This repeating decimal has the digits of ( n ), but the order of the digits has been changed so that the first digit is now the last and the rest of the digits preserve their relative order. By the problem statement, the repeating digits are the digits of ( frac{n}{3} ) in the same order, so the repeating decimal equals ( frac{x}{3} ). Therefore: [ 10x - frac{x}{3} = frac{29x}{3} ] 8. Since ( frac{29x}{3} ) is an integer and ( 0 < x < 1 ), the values of ( x ) are in the form ( frac{3k}{29} ) where ( k ) is an integer between 1 and 9 inclusive. We need to find the smallest possible value of the sum of the digits of ( n ). 9. Compute the decimal representation of ( frac{3k}{29} ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 9 ) and find the sum of the digits.

The total work done by all termites in one hour would be 622W (since there are 622 termites). The total work done by all monkeys in one hour would be 239 * 1.5W = 358.5W. The total work done by all ants in one hour would be 345 * 0.75W = 258.75W. The combined work done by all animals in one hour would be the sum of the work done by termites, monkeys, and ants: Total work in one hour = 622W + 358.5W + 258.75W Total work in one hour = 1239.25W Since the total work to be done is 'Wx' (the work one termite does in 'x' hours), we can find the time 't' it takes for all animals to complete the construction together by dividing the total work by the work done per hour by all animals: t = Total work / Total work in one hour t = Wx / 1239.25W The 'W' cancels out: t = x / 1239.25 So, it takes boxed{1/1239.25} of the time it would take one termite to complete the task for all the animals to complete it together."},{"prompt":"1991 the population of a town was a perfect square.

In 2001, after an increase of 180 people, the population is p^2 + 180. According to the problem, this is 16 more than a perfect square, so we can express it as q^2 + 16. Therefore: [ p^2 + 180 = q^2 + 16 ] Simplifying, we find: [ q^2 - p^2 = 164 ] Which factors as: [ q^2 - p^2 = (q-p)(q+p) = 164 ] 2. **Find Factor Pairs:** The factors of 164 are 1, 2, 4, 41, 82, and 164. We consider possible pairs: - (1, 164) - (2, 82) - (4, 41) 3. **Test Factor Pairs:** - For (q-p, q+p) = (4, 41): [ q-p = 4 quad text{and} quad q+p = 41 ] Solving these, we get q = 22.5 and p = 18.5. However, since q and p must be integers, this pair is invalid. - For (q-p, q+p) = (2, 82): [ q-p = 2 quad text{and} quad q+p = 82 ] Solving these, we get q = 42 and p = 40.

This is because any number greater than 1 raised to a positive power less than 1 will result in a number between 1 and the base. Therefore, we have: [1 < 3^{0.3} < 3] [1 < a < 3] 2. **For b=left(frac{1}{2}right)^{-2.1}:** This can be rewritten using the property of exponents that a^{-n} = frac{1}{a^n}. So, we have: [b = 2^{2.1}] Since 2.1 is slightly more than 2, and 2^2 = 4, raising 2 to a power slightly more than 2 will give us a value slightly more than 4. Thus: [b > 4] 3. **For c=2log_{5}2:** To understand c's value, we need to consider the logarithmic function. The expression 2log_{5}2 means we are looking for the power to which 5 must be raised to get 2, and then we multiply this by 2. Since 5 to any power greater than 0 and less than 1 will give a number between 1 and 5, and we are looking for a number (2) that is less than 5, the logarithm of 2 base 5 will be a positive number less than 1. Multiplying this by 2 will still give a number less than 2. Therefore: [c < 2] Since c is being compared to a and b, and we know a is between 1 and 3, and b is greater than 4, it's more precise to say: [c < 1] since 2log_{5}2 is indeed less than 1 when evaluated. Comparing a, b, and c: - We have established that c < 1. - a is between 1 and 3. - b is greater than 4.

Consider the instance with 19 copies of the number ( 0.9 + varepsilon ) for some small (positive) ( varepsilon ) very close to 0. The total sum of these numbers is: [ 19 times (0.9 + varepsilon) = 17.1 + 19varepsilon ] If we try to partition these numbers into two groups, one of the groups must contain at least 10 copies. The sum of these 10 copies is: [ 10 times (0.9 + varepsilon) = 9 + 10varepsilon ] Since ( varepsilon ) is positive, ( 9 + 10varepsilon > 9 ). Therefore, it is impossible to partition these numbers into two groups with sums not exceeding 9 if ( S > 17.1 ). 2. **Proving that ( S = frac{171}{10} ) works:** (B) The value ( S = frac{171}{10} ) works. Consider a set of ( n ) real numbers ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) such that ( x_1 ge x_2 ge cdots ge x_n ). We will form two groups by starting with two empty groups and assigning each number ( x_i ) to the group with the currently smaller sum. Suppose we get stuck at some moment while trying to assign ( x_k ). At this moment, we have assigned ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{k-1} ) to the two groups, and the sum of all these assigned numbers is at most ( S - x_k ). (1) The smaller sum of the two groups is at most ( frac{S - x_k}{2} ). (2) Since we are stuck, this means that adding ( x_k ) to the group with the smaller sum would exceed 9: [ x_k + frac{S - x_k}{2} > 9 ] Simplifying this inequality: [ 2x_k + S - x_k > 18 implies x_k + S > 18 implies x_k > 18 - S ] Given ( S = frac{171}{10} ): [ x_k > 18 - frac{171}{10} = 18 - 17.1 = 0.9 ] Therefore, ( x_k > 0.9 ). (3) Suppose ( k ge 19 ). Then ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k > 0.9 ) implies that the sum of all these numbers is strictly above: [ 19 times 0.9 = 17.1 ] This contradicts the assumption that the total sum is at most ( S = 17.1 ). Hence, ( k le 18 ). (4) Since ( k le 18 ), one of the two groups (at the moment before assigning ( x_k )) contains at most 8 numbers. Since all numbers are from ([0,1]), the sum of that group is at most 8. Therefore, ( x_k ) can be added to this group without exceeding the bound of 9.

Since a cube has 6 faces, the total surface area of the cube is: [ 6 times 16 = 96text{ cm}^2. ] 2. **Analyze the effect of removing each larger corner cube**: Each corner cube is a 2text{ cm} times 2text{ cm} times 2text{ cm} cube. Removing one corner cube affects three faces of the original cube. Each of these faces loses a square of 2 times 2 = 4text{ cm}^2. Therefore, removing one corner cube removes 3 times 4 = 12text{ cm}^2 from the original surface area. 3. **Consider the new faces exposed by removing the corner cube**: When a corner cube is removed, it exposes three new 2text{ cm} times 2text{ cm} faces on the original cube. The total area of these new faces is 3 times 4 = 12text{ cm}^2. 4. **Net change in surface area due to one corner cube**: The decrease in surface area due to the removal of the corner cube's exterior faces is exactly balanced by the increase in surface area due to the new faces exposed.

We need to show that in a group of 50 children aged between 7 and 13, from 11 different countries, at least 5 children must each have more same-aged peers than peers from the same country. 1. **Matrix Representation**: - Construct a 7 times 11 matrix where rows represent ages (from 7 to 13 years) and columns represent countries. - Let a_{ij} represent the number of children of age 6 + i (i.e., ages 7 to 13) from the j-th country. 2. **Define Row Sums and Column Sums**: - Let r_i denote the sum of the i-th row, i.e., r_i = sum_{j=1}^{11} a_{ij}, which represents the total number of children of age 6+i. - Let c_j denote the sum of the j-th column, i.e., c_j = sum_{i=1}^{7} a_{ij}, which represents the total number of children from the j-th country. 3. **Analyzing the Expression**: [ sum_{i=1}^{7} sum_{j=1}^{11} a_{ij}left(frac{1}{c_j} - frac{1}{r_i}right) ] First, split the double sum: [ begin{aligned} sum_{i=1}^{7} sum_{j=1}^{11} a_{ij}left(frac{1}{c_j} - frac{1}{r_i}right) &= sum_{i=1}^{7} sum_{j=1}^{11} frac{a_{ij}}{c_j} - sum_{i=1}^{7} sum_{j=1}^{11} frac{a_{ij}}{r_i} &= sum_{j=1}^{11} frac{1}{c_j} sum_{i=1}^{7} a_{ij} - sum_{i=1}^{7} frac{1}{r_i} sum_{j=1}^{11} a_{ij} end{aligned} ] 4. **Simplify the Expression**: Note that sum_{i=1}^{7} a_{ij} = c_j and sum_{j=1}^{11} a_{ij} = r_i, so: [ begin{aligned} sum_{j=1}^{11} frac{1}{c_j} sum_{i=1}^{7} a_{ij} - sum_{i=1}^{7} frac{1}{r_i} sum_{j=1}^{11} a_{ij} &= sum_{j=1}^{11} frac{c_j}{c_j} - sum_{i=1}^{7} frac{r_i}{r_i} &= sum_{j=1}^{11} 1 - sum_{i=1}^{7} 1 &= 11 - 7 &= 4. end{aligned} ] 5. **Interpreting the Result**: Since ( a_{ij}left(frac{1}{c_j} - frac{1}{r_i}right) < 1 ), there must be at least 5 pairs ((i, j)) for which (frac{1}{c_j} - frac{1}{r_i} > 0).

Since the servant was supposed to get 90 USD for a year, for 9 months, it would be: ( frac{9}{12} times 90 ) USD ( = frac{3}{4} times 90 ) USD ( = 67.5 ) USD The servant received 55 USD after 9 months, so the value of the turban in USD at the time of receiving it would be the difference between the prorated salary and the cash received: ( 67.5 ) USD - ( 55 ) USD = ( 12.5 ) USD Now, we need to find the initial price of the turban in USD when he started working. We know that the servant sold the turban for 2500 INR after 9 months when the exchange rate was 1 USD = 45 INR. So, the value of the turban in USD at the time of selling it would be: ( frac{2500 text{ INR}}{45 text{ INR/USD}} ) = ( frac{2500}{45} ) USD ( = 55.56 ) USD (rounded to two decimal places) Since the value of the turban in USD increased from the time the servant received it to the time he sold it, we need to calculate the initial price of the turban in USD based on the devaluation of the currency.

First, we see that M contains 1 and N contains 0. For the sets to be equal, 1 must be equal to 0, which is not possible. However, since the sets still must be equal, 1 must not be equated to 0 but to the other elements in N. Thus, 1 must be equal to frac{b}{a} or b. 2. We cannot equate 1 to b directly, because if 1=b, then b=1. But this leads to a contradiction as no element in M is equal to 0. Therefore, 1 = frac{b}{a}, which leads to a = b. 3. Now that we know a = b, we can say a + b = a + a = 2a = 0 for the sets to be equal (as a + b is in M and corresponds to the 0 in N). Solving 2a = 0 gives us a = 0. But this poses a problem because if a = 0, then frac{b}{a} is undefined. 4. To rectify this issue, we must think differently. Instead of a = b, we use the fact that 1 = frac{b}{a}. This leads us to b = a. Substituting this into a + b = 0 gives us a + a = 0 or 2a = 0, which implies a = 0. But as before, a cannot be 0 since it would make frac{b}{a} undefined. 5. To solve this, we rearrange the equation 1 = frac{b}{a} to get a = b. Then, using a + b = 0, we substitute a for b and get a + a = 2a = 0 leading to a = 0. 6. With a = 0, this contradicts the initial statement that a cannot be 0. Therefore, we reconsider our initial approach. We realize that a+b must be the element that is equal to 0 (as both are in the sets M and N respectively), not a equaling b. 7. Now, using the correct equations: since 1 must equal frac{b}{a}, we get a = b. From a + b = 0, and knowing that a = b, we get 2b = 0 or b = 0. 8. However, this also leads to a contradiction since if b = 0, then frac{b}{a} = 0 and there would be a duplicate 0 in set N, which is not allowed because the elements in a set must be unique. 9. Therefore, 1 cannot equal frac{b}{a}; otherwise, we end up with contradictions. This means we must have 1 = b and frac{b}{a} = a, leading to a^2 = b. 10. Now, using a + b = 0 with 1 = b, we have a + 1 = 0, which provides a = -1. 11. Substituting a = -1 into a^2 = b, we find that b = (-1)^2 = 1.

For any ( (x, y) in u cup v ): [ 0 = (y - p) left(y + frac{x}{kappa} - qright) = h(x, y) - left(frac{p}{kappa} - kright)x - (p + q)y + pq ] - Since ( h(x, y) = text{const} ), we have ( h(x, y) = -pq ) and ( p = kappa k ), ( q = -p = -kappa k ). 8. **Intersection Points and Tangents**: - Let ( MK ) cut the y-axis at ( Q ) and let ( P ) be the reflection of ( Q ) in ( A ). The asymptote ( u parallel AK ) passes through ( P ) and ( v perp MK ) passes through ( Q ). - Since the absolute term of the hyperbola equation is ( 0 ), ( A in mathcal{D} ). Since ( A ) is the midpoint of ( [PQ] ), ( PQ ) is tangent to ( mathcal{D} ) at ( A ). 9. **Hyperbola Center and Major Axis**: - The intersection ( X equiv u cap v ) is the hyperbola center. The internal bisector ( w ) of ( measuredangle PXQ ) is the hyperbola major axis line. - Let ( E ) and ( F ) be the hyperbola foci, which need to be constructed. 10. **Construction of Foci**: - The hyperbola tangent ( PAQ ), bisecting ( measuredangle FAE ), intersects the perpendicular bisector of ( [EF] ) through ( X ) at ( S ). - The circumcircle ( (Y) ) of ( triangle AEF ), centered on ( XS ) and passing through ( A ) and ( S ), intersects the hyperbola major axis line ( w ) at the hyperbola foci ( E ) and ( F ). 11. **Hyperbola Vertices**: - The perpendicular projection ( E_0 ) of the focus ( E ) on the hyperbola tangent ( PQ ) lies on the hyperbola pedal circle ( (X) ), which intersects the hyperbola major axis line ( w ) at the hyperbola vertices ( U ) and ( V ). 12. **Circle Construction**: - Let ( (E) ) be a circle centered at ( E ) with radius ( [UV] ). Let ( F' ) be the reflection of ( F ) in ( LM ). - The two circles ( (D_1) ) and ( (D_2) ) through ( F ) and ( F' ), and externally tangent to ( (E) ) at ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ), are centered on the line ( LM ). 13. **Intersection Points**: - Since ( [D_1E] - [D_1F] = [D_1E] - [D_1T_1] = [T_1E] = [UV] ) and similarly, ( [D_2E] - [D_2F] = [UV] ), ( D_1 ) and ( D_2 in mathcal{D} ) are intersections of the line ( LM ) and the hyperbola ( mathcal{D} ). 14. **Radical Axes and Tangents**: - Let ( (G) ) be an arbitrary circle through ( F ) and ( F' ), preferably intersecting ( (E) ) at ( J ) and ( J' ). The radical axes ( FF' ) and ( JJ' ) of circle pairs ( (D_1), (G) ) and ( (E), (G) ) meet at the radical center ( R ) of ( (D_1), (E), (G) ). - Tangents ( RT_1 ) and ( RT_2 ) of ( (E) ) from ( R ) are radical axes of externally tangent circle pairs ( (D_1), (E) ) and ( (D_2), (E) ). Thus, ( D_1 equiv ET_1 cap LM ) and ( D_2 equiv ET_2 cap LM ). 15. **Circumcenters of Rectangles**: - The perpendicular bisectors of ( [AD_1] ) and ( [AD_2] ) intersect the line ( AK ) at the circumcenters ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) of rectangles ( AB_1C_1D_1 ) and ( AB_2C_2D_2 ), respectively, providing the two problem solutions.

When there are carries involved in binary addition, the number of 1's can be reduced. Let's explore the optimal configuration to minimize the number of 1's in the resulting sum a + b. 1. **Consider the simplest cases to find a pattern**: - If we add a number with a single 1 and a number with multiple 1's, the presence of carries can affect the total count of 1's. - For example, 1_2 + 1_2 = 10_2, where there is just one 1 in the binary representation of 2_{10}. 2. **Represent the numbers carefully to produce carrying**: Let's emphasize the example given in the reference solution: - Suppose a is a number with 2004 1's which could be strategically placed to produce maximum carries when added with b. - b is another number with 2005 1's. 3. **Addition of binary numbers involving carrying**: Let's think of: [ a = 111 ldots 100 ldots 01 ] where there is an appropriate arrangement of 1's and 0's. - Imagine a has its 1's spread in such a way leading to large carries with b. - Take b as a long streak of 1's: [ b = 11 ldots 11 ] We can illustrate the addition as follows with a possible arrangement: [ begin{array}{r} 111 cdots 100 cdots 01 + 11 cdots 11 hline 1000 cdots 000 end{array} ] By setting up the above result, where suitable carries occur, the final number of 1's can be minimized. 4. **Formal configuration**: - One sees that efficient placement results in carrying forward producing a result like: a = 2^{4008} - 2^{2005} + 1 b = 2^{2005} - 1 5. **Conclusion**: The addition leads to one large carry through the digits making the sum: [ a + b = 2^{4008} ] which has only one 1 in its binary representation.

This implies that all ( a_i ) must have the same parity (either all even or all odd). 3. **Odd ( n ):** If ( n ) is odd, we can construct an *expensive* ( n )-tuple by setting ( a_1 = a_2 = cdots = a_n = 1 ).

Thus: [ x_2 = frac{x_1 + x_3}{2} ] This implies: [ x_1 + x_3 = 2x_2 ] 4. **Relation involving sums:** Since (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = -a), substituting (x_2 = -frac{a}{3}) (because (x_2) is the mean of (x_1) and (x_3)) gives: [ x_2 = -frac{a}{3} ] Hence: [ x_1 + x_3 = -frac{2a}{3} ] 5. **Product of roots using Vieta's formulas:** Vieta's formulas also give us the product of the roots taken two at a time: [ b = x_1 x_3 + x_2 (x_1 + x_3) ] Substituting (x_2 = -frac{a}{3}) and (x_1 + x_3 = -frac{2a}{3}) into the above equation, we get: [ b = x_1 x_3 + left(-frac{a}{3}right) left(-frac{2a}{3}right) ] [ b = x_1 x_3 + frac{2a^2}{9} ] Rearranging to find (x_1 x_3): [ x_1 x_3 = b - frac{2a^2}{9} ] 6. **Determining the constant term (c):** Again, using Vieta's formulas, we know: [ -c = x_1 x_2 x_3 ] Substituting (x_2 = -frac{a}{3}) and (x_1 x_3 = b - frac{2a^2}{9}): [ -c = left(-frac{a}{3}right) left(b - frac{2a^2}{9}right) ] Simplifying this equation, we get: [ c = frac{a}{3}left(b - frac{2a^2}{9}right) ] 7. **Checking for real roots:** For (x_1) and (x_3) to be real, the quadratic formed by their sum and product must have a non-negative discriminant.

For the inequality to be less than zero, one of the factors must be positive and the other must be negative. Let's analyze the possibilities: 1. If ab^2 + cde^3 is positive and fg^2h + f^3 - g^2 is negative, then we can have a, b, c, d, e positive and f, g, h negative. However, we know that |d| < |f| < |h|, so d cannot be the largest in absolute value among f and h. If f and h are negative, d must be positive to ensure that |d| < |f| < |h|.

We are given that if we take any (2n) numbers from these (2n+1) numbers, we can always split them into two groups of (n) numbers each, with equal sums. We want to prove that all the (2n+1) numbers are equal. 3. First, observe that adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing all (2n+1) numbers by the same non-zero number does not affect the condition that any (2n) numbers can be split into two groups with equal sums. Therefore, we can transform these rational numbers into integers by multiplying by a common denominator. 4. Suppose (b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{2n+1}) are the integers obtained from (a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{2n+1}) by clearing denominators. 5. Next, subtract the smallest number from all the (b_{i})s to get a new sequence (c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{2n+1}). Now, at least one of these integers is zero because we have subtracted the smallest number. 6. We need to show that (c_{1} = c_{2} = cdots = c_{2n+1} = 0). 7. Assume there exist some (c_{i} neq 0). Without loss of generality, let (c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{m}) be non-zero numbers, and (c_{m+1} = c_{m+2} = cdots = c_{2n+1} = 0). 8. Each (c_{i}) (where (i = 1, 2, cdots, m)) can be uniquely expressed in the form (c_{i} = 2^{l_{i}} cdot k_{i}), where (k_{i}) is an odd number. 9. Let (min {l_{1}, l_{2}, cdots, l_{m}} = l_{j}). Now, define (d_{i} = frac{c_{i}}{2^{l_{j}}}) for (i = 1, 2, cdots, 2n+1). 10. The sequence (d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{2n+1}) satisfies the original problem's condition (i.e., picking any (2n) numbers can always be split into two groups with equal sums). 11. Notice that (d_{j} = k_{j}) is odd and (d_{m+1} = d_{m+2} = cdots = d_{2n+1} = 0) are even. 12. Because the numbers (d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{2n+1}) are supposed to be able to split into two groups with equal sums, the sum of any (2n) numbers picked from these must be even. 13. However, since (d_{j}) for some (j) is odd, and (d_{m+1}, d_{m+2}, cdots, d_{2n+1}) are even, the total number of odd and even (d_i)'s must match the condition where their sum can be even, leading to a contradiction. Odd and even properties cannot simultaneously hold to satisfy the splitting condition where sums are equal. 14. Thus, our initial assumption that some (c_i neq 0) must be false. 15. Hence, all (c_i) must be zero. Consequently, all (b_i) are equal, and initially, all (a_i) must be equal.

If ( y ) is even, then ( x + yi ) can be represented as the sum of squares of three complex integers. Part 1: Necessity Assume ( x + yi = (a + bi)^2 + (c + di)^2 + (e + fi)^2 ), where ( a, b, c, d, e, f ) are integers. Expanding the sum of squares, we get: [ (a + bi)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi ] [ (c + di)^2 = c^2 - d^2 + 2cdi ] [ (e + fi)^2 = e^2 - f^2 + 2efi ] Adding these complex numbers together, the imaginary part can be expressed as: [ yi = 2(ab + cd + ef)i ] Thus, [ y = 2(ab + cd + ef) ] Since ( ab, cd, ef ) are products of integers, ( y ) must be even (( y = 2 times text{integer} )).

For ( n = |M| geq 8 ), denote: [ M = { m_1, m_2, cdots, m_n } ] where each ( m_i ) is a distinct integer obtained as above. We need to prove that (gcd(m_1, m_2, cdots, m_n) = 1). 9. To show (gcd(m_1, m_2, cdots, m_n) = 1), consider any prime ( p ). Given that the GCD of any three of ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_8 ) is 1, ( p ) can divide at most two of these numbers. 10. Because ( p ) divides at most two of ( a_1, a_2, cdots, a_8 ), it follows that ( p ) does not divide the product of any six remaining numbers. Hence, within the set ( M ), there is at least one number that is coprime with ( p ). 11. Consequently, (gcd(m_1, m_2, cdots, m_n) = 1 ). 12. Next, consider any three numbers ( m_p, m_q, m_r ) where ( 1 leq p < q < r leq n ). 13. Each ( m_i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq n )) is of the form: [ m_i = prod_{u in A_i} a_u ] where ( A_i ) is a six-element subset of ( {1, 2, cdots, 8} ). 14.

Therefore, there must exist two numbers ( i, j in A_p cap A_q cap A_r ). 17. By the initial condition, (gcd(a_i, a_j) = 1), so: [ a_i a_j mid m_p, quad a_i a_j mid m_q, quad a_i a_j mid m_r ] 18. Thus: [ a_i a_j mid (m_p + m_q + m_r) ] 19.

Note that whether an element ( a_k ) (for ( 2 leq k leq n )) can be a dragon head is unrelated to the elements before ( a_k ). 3. **Establishing a Shortest Dragon:** For any ( a_k ) (for ( 1 leq k leq n )) that can be a dragon head, we define the shortest dragon starting from ( a_k ) as the minimum segment with ( a_k ) as the head such that the segment's average is greater than 1988. 4. **Dragon Length and Conditions:** Assume ( a_k ) can be the dragon head, and ( a_k, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{k+i} ) is the shortest dragon with ( a_k ) as the head.

The shortest dragon it forms is ( a_{k1}, a_{k1+1}, ldots, a_{k1+l1} ). 7. **Further Elements as Dragon Heads:** If there are more elements subsequently that can serve as dragon heads, denote the next one starting from ( k1 + l1 + 1 ) as ( a_{k2} ). Continue this method: - Identify ( a_{k2}, ldots, a_{k2+l2} ) with ( a_{k2+l2+1} ), - Proceed until no further dragons are identified. 8. **Final Identification and Conclusion:** Hence, obtain ( j ) such shortest dragons: [ a_{k1}, ldots, a_{k1+l1}; quad a_{k2}, ldots, a_{k2+l2}; quad ldots; quad a_{kj}, ldots, a_{kj+lj}. ] All elements ( a_{k1}, ldots, a_{k1+l1}; a_{k2}, ldots, a_{k2+l2}; ldots; a_{kj}, ldots, a_{kj+lj} ) have an average greater than 1988 based on the dragon definition and segmentation.

Two cubes will be considered adjacent if they touch along their faces. Thus, one cube can have up to 6 neighbors. It is known that the number of cubes with exactly 6 neighbors is 836. Find the number of cubes with no more than four neighbors. 1. **Define the problem and the formula**: Let's denote the side lengths of the large parallelepiped by (a), (b), and (c). The number of cubes with exactly 6 neighbors is given by the product ((a-2)(b-2)(c-2)). This formula represents the number of internal unit cubes in the parallelepiped, as internal cubes (not on the face, edge, or vertex) have all possible 6 neighbors. 2. **Given information**: We are given that the number of cubes with exactly 6 neighbors is 836.

Given the uniqueness of factorizing 836 into integers greater than 2, we perform this task.

Since the larger of the two numbers is 391, we can write: A = 391 B = H * k (where k is some integer) The least common multiple (l.c.m.) of A and B can be expressed as: l.c.m.(A, B) = H * 13 * 17 Since 391 is one of the numbers and it is also the product of 17 and 23 (391 = 17 * 23), we can infer that 17 is a prime factor of A. Therefore, 17 is not a part of the h.c.f. H, because if it were, 17 would not be a factor of the l.c.m. in addition to H (since the l.c.m. is a product of the h.c.f. and any additional prime factors not shared by both numbers). Now, we need to determine if 13 is a factor of A (391). Since 391 is not divisible by 13, we know that 13 is not a factor of A and thus must be a factor of B. Given that the l.c.m. is a product of the h.c.f. and the additional prime factors not shared by both numbers, and since 13 and 17 are both prime numbers, we can deduce that the h.c.f. H does not include 13 or 17 as factors. Therefore, the h.c.f. H must be a factor of 391 that is not 17 (since we've already established that 17 is a factor of 391). The only factors of 391 are 1, 17, 23, and 391. Since 17 is not the h.c.f., the only possible value for the h.c.f. is 23 (because 1 would imply that the numbers are co-prime and 391 cannot be the h.c.f. as it is one of the numbers itself).

This means that a knight always lands on a square of opposite color (in a typical two-color chessboard). 3. **Strategy for Coloring:** Coloring in a chessboard pattern ensures that a knight's move from any uncolored square will always land on a colored square. This pattern is achieved by coloring half the squares of the grid. 4. **Calculating the Number of Squares:** Given the grid size is (65 times 65), the total number of squares is: [ 65^2 = 4225 text{ cells} ] 5. **Minimum Coloring Requirement:** Since we need to color at least half of these squares to satisfy the knight's move restriction, we calculate: [ leftlfloor frac{65^2}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{4225}{2} rightrfloor = 2112.5 implies 2112 text{ cells} ] Here, we take the floor function ( leftlfloor x rightrfloor ) because the number of cells must be an integer. 6. **Verification:** By ensuring that we color half the cells in the chessboard pattern, a knight on an uncolored square cannot jump to another uncolored square since each jump changes the cell color. No knight can thus move from one uncolored to another, fulfilling the problem's requirement. # Conclusion The smallest number of cells required to be colored in a (65 times 65) grid so that a knight cannot move from one uncolored cell to another is: [ boxed{2112} ]"},{"prompt":"For any differentiable function (f(x)) on (mathbb{R}), if it satisfies (x neq 1) and ((x1) cdot f'(x) > 0), then it must be true that ( ) A: (f(0) + f(2) > 2f(1)) B: (f(0) + f(2) < 2f(1)) C: (f(0) + f(2) geqslant 2f(1)) D: (f(0) + f(2) leqslant 2f(1))","completion":"**Analysis** This question mainly examines the use of derivatives to study the monotonicity of functions. **Solution** When (x > 1), (f'(x) > 0), the function (f(x)) is increasing on ((1, +infty)); When (x < 1), (f'(x) < 0), the function (f(x)) is decreasing on ((-â, 1)); Therefore, (f(x)) attains its minimum value at (x = 1), which means (f(0) > f(1)) and (f(2) > f(1)), thus, (f(0) + f(2) > 2f(1)).

The relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds because they are moving towards each other. The speed of the slower train is 36 kmph, and the speed of the faster train is 45 kmph. Relative speed = Speed of slower train + Speed of faster train Relative speed = 36 kmph + 45 kmph Relative speed = 81 kmph Now, we need to convert this relative speed from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per second (m/s) because the length of the faster train is given in meters and we want to find the time in seconds. To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds Relative speed in m/s = 81 kmph * (1000 m / 3600 s) Relative speed in m/s = 81 * (1000 / 3600) Relative speed in m/s = 81 * (5 / 18) Relative speed in m/s = 81 * 5 / 18 Relative speed in m/s = 405 / 18 Relative speed in m/s = 22.5 m/s Now that we have the relative speed in meters per second, we can calculate the time it takes for the man in the slower train to pass the faster train. The length of the faster train is 225.018 meters. To pass the faster train completely, the man in the slower train has to travel the entire length of the faster train. Time (in seconds) = Length of the faster train / Relative speed Time (in seconds) = 225.018 meters / 22.5 m/s Time (in seconds) = 10.001 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{10.001} seconds for the man in the slower train to pass the faster train."},{"prompt":"Two congruent isosceles right triangles are placed so that they overlap partly and their hypotenuses coincide.

This would force a scenario where an ( A_k ) square is adjacent to a ( B_k ) square, contradicting our assumption. 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our initial assumption that there exist no two adjacent squares in the ( n times n ) grid such that the absolute difference between the numbers in those two squares is at least ( n ) must be false.
