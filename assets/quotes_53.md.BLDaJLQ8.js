So when K=n, we get: P(xi=n)= frac {1}{2^{n}} From the series of equalities, we can deduce that the value of n must equate the expression to a value such that it is reducible to a probability, and since probabilities sum to 1 over all possible outcomes, we can infer that n must ensure that the sum of probabilities sum_{k=1}^{n} P(xi=k) tends to 1. Hence this equation implies that the expected value should be a finite number as per the distribution's nature.

Consider a line through S that is parallel to side BC. Let the intersection points of this line with sides AB and AC be B' and C', respectively. This divides the triangle ABC into triangle AB'C' and quadrilateral BB'C'C. 2. Since line BC is parallel to line B'C', triangle ABC is similar to triangle AB'C'.

We also know that if the line through S passes precisely through one vertex of the triangle, it will divide the triangle into two equal areas. Given these symmetries and the uniform behavior of the vertices A, B, and C, it suffices to examine the cases where the line through S intersects the sides of the triangle other than parallel and vertex cases. 7. For simplicity, let's assume the area of triangle ABC is 1. 8. If B_1 and C_1 denote the intercept points of the line through S with extensions of AB and AC but inside the segments (i.e., between AB and AC), let’s analyze: - B_1 being further from S than B' on AB implies that B_1S > B'S, and similarly, C_1 being closer to S than C' on AC implies C_1S < C'S. - Since B'S = SC', we conclude that B_1S > SC_1. 9.

According to the problem, B_1 lies on the median CM of the triangle ACD and C_1 lies on the median BM of the triangle ABD, where M is the midpoint of AD. **Step 2: Use the definition of altitudes** Since BB_1 is the altitude from B to the plane ACD, it follows that BB_1 is perpendicular to AD. Similarly, since CC_1 is the altitude from C to the plane ABD, it follows that CC_1 is perpendicular to AD. Because both BB_1 and CC_1 are perpendicular to AD, the segment AD is perpendicular to the plane BMC, which contains the intersecting lines BB_1 and CC_1. **Step 3: Prove symmetry** By definition, in a triangle, if a median is also an altitude, the triangle is isosceles. Here, since BM is both a median and an altitude of triangle ABD, we have AB = BD. Similarly, because CM is both a median and an altitude of triangle ACD, we have AC = CD.

For instance, if we consider the remaining altitudes, we can repeat the previous steps to show AB = AC = AD, BD = CD, and similar relationships.

The expression is (4)^11 x (7)^5 x (11)^2. First, let's break down each term: - The number 4 is not a prime number; it is 2^2. So (4)^11 is (2^2)^11, which is 2^(2*11) = 2^22. - The number 7 is a prime number. So (7)^5 is already in prime factor form. - The number 11 is also a prime number. So (11)^2 is already in prime factor form. Now, let's count the total number of prime factors: - For 2^22, we have 22 prime factors of 2. - For (7)^5, we have 5 prime factors of 7. - For (11)^2, we have 2 prime factors of 11. Adding them up, we get the total number of prime factors: 22 (from 2^22) + 5 (from 7^5) + 2 (from 11^2) = 22 + 5 + 2 = 29.

Prove that there exist 100 pairwise disjoint chords connecting some of these points, such that the sum of the numbers at the ends of each chord is equal.","completion":"Let's solve the problem step-by-step: 1. **Simplification and Notation:** Let n = 2^{499}. Hence, we have 2n points numbered from 1 to 2n, and the possible sums of endpoints of some pair of points are from 3 to 4n - 1. Define colors c_{3}, c_{4}, ldots , c_{4n-1}, and color a chord with the color c_i if the sum of the numbers at its endpoints is i. 2. **Graph Construction:** Consider a graph G_{c} for each color c. The vertices of G_{c} represent the pairs (chords) of points colored by color c. Two vertices in G_{c} are connected by an edge if the corresponding chords are not disjoint (i.e., they share an endpoint). 3. **Goal:** We aim to show that there exists a color c such that the graph G_{c} contains at least 100 independent vertices (100 chords that do not intersect). 4. **Applying Theorem to Graphs:** To do this, we will use a result from exercise 12, which states that we need to show that the average of the quantities f(G_{c}) = sum_{v in G_{c}} frac{1}{1 + d(v)} over all graphs G_{c} is greater than 100. 5. **Counting Chords:** Each chord ell divides the circle into two arcs. By the pigeonhole principle, one of these arcs, say the \\"small arc,\\" contains at most n-1 points. For each i = 0,1, ldots, n-2, there are 2n chords ell such that the \\"small arc\\" contains exactly i points. The degree of such a chord in its corresponding graph G_{c} is at most i, because any intersecting chord must have an endpoint among the i points in the \\"small arc.\\" 6. **Contribution to the Sum:** Hence, for each i in {0, ldots , n-2}, the 2n chords ell with a small arc containing i points contribute at least frac{2n}{1 + i} to the sum sum_{c} f(G_{c}). Since there are 4n - 3 colors in total, averaging over all colors, we get: [ f(G_{c}) geq frac{2n}{4n - 3} sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{i}. ] 7. **Harmonic Series Approximation:** It remains to show that: [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{i} > 200 text{ for } n = 499. ] Notice that we can approximate the harmonic series as: [ sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{i} approx 1 + sum_{k=1}^{499} sum_{i=2^{k-1} + 1}^{2^{k}} frac{1}{i}. ] For each term sum_{i=2^{k-1} + 1}^{2^{k}} frac{1}{i}, we can bound it from below: [ sum_{i=2^{k-1} + 1}^{2^{k}} frac{1}{i} > frac{2^{k-1}}{2^{k}} = frac{1}{2}. ] Summing these contributions, we get: [ sum_{k=1}^{499} frac{1}{2} = frac{499}{2}. ] Adding the initial 1 from the sum approximation: [ 1 + frac{499}{2} = 1 + 249.5 = 250.5, ] which is clearly greater than 200. 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we have shown that for some color c, the graph G_{c} contains a set of at least 100 independent vertices, implying that there exists a set of 100 pairwise disjoint chords.

The loss in terms of cost price is: [ L = frac{56}{100} cdot C ] Since 60% of the goods were stolen, the cost price of the stolen goods is: [ C_{stolen} = 0.6 cdot C ] The loss L should be equal to the cost price of the stolen goods C_{stolen}, so we have: [ L = C_{stolen} ] [ frac{56}{100} cdot C = 0.6 cdot C ] Now, we need to find the profit percentage P that would result in a loss of 56% when 60% of the goods are stolen. We know that the selling price of the remaining goods S' should be equal to the cost price of all the goods minus the loss: [ S' = C - L ] [ 0.4 cdot C(1 + frac{P}{100}) = C - frac{56}{100} cdot C ] [ 0.4 cdot C(1 + frac{P}{100}) = 0.44 cdot C ] [ 1 + frac{P}{100} = frac{0.44}{0.4} ] [ 1 + frac{P}{100} = 1.1 ] [ frac{P}{100} = 1.1 - 1 ] [ frac{P}{100} = 0.1 ] [ P = 0.1 cdot 100 ] [ P = 10 ] Therefore, the profit percentage the shopkeeper takes on his goods is boxed{10%} ."},{"prompt":"Given positive integers (a, b, k) satisfying (frac{a^{2} + b^{2}}{a b 1} = k), prove that (k = 5).","completion":"Given the equation [ frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab - 1} = k ] we must show that ( k = 5 ). 1. **Case Analysis on ( a ) and ( b )**: Suppose ( a = b ).

If we let x represent the number of small branches that grow from each branch, then the total number of branches that each main stem grows is also x. This is because the problem implies a symmetry in the growth pattern. Therefore, the total number of main stems, branches, and small branches can be represented as 1 (for the main stem) + x (for the branches off the main stem) + x^2 (since each of the x branches grows x small branches).

Therefore, (k leq a - 1). 6. **Lower bound for (|Q(1)|)**: Since (|Q(1)| geq prod_{i=1}^n a_i) and (Q(1) equiv 1 pmod{prod_{i=1}^n a_i}), it follows that (Q(1) = 1). 7. **Evaluate (P(1))**: We have (P(1) = 1 - a), and thus (a = k prod_{i=1}^n a_i). Since (k mid a) and (P(a) = 0), it follows that (k mid -1), implying (k = 1). 8. **Contradiction**: By the rational root theorem, (a mid prod_{i=1}^{n}(a_i - 1) + 1).

Now, 199.99999999999994 cows run away, which we can round to 200 for practical purposes (since the number is extremely close to 200 and it's unlikely that a fraction of a cow would run away).

To apply this method, we think of x, y, and z as numbers of stars and the equation x+y+z=10 means we have 10 stars to distribute. We can represent a possible distribution by arranging 10 stars in a row and placing two bars to separate them into three sections.

Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). - When k > 0, we analyze f'(x): - For 0 < x < k, x-k < 0 and x+1 > 0, so f'(x) < 0, meaning f(x) is monotonically decreasing. - For x > k, both x-k > 0 and x+1 > 0, so f'(x) > 0, meaning f(x) is monotonically increasing. In summary: - For k leq 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty). - For k > 0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, k) and monotonically increasing on (k, +infty). **(2) Range of values for k:** Given k > 0 and f(x_0) < frac{3}{2} - k^2, we need to find the range of k. - Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, k) and monotonically increasing on (k, +infty), the minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = k.

Therefore, we find that: [ z = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} - frac{sqrt{2}}{2}i ] 5. The conjugate of z, denoted as overline{z}, is found by changing the sign of the imaginary part of z. Thus: [ overline{z} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} + frac{sqrt{2}}{2}i ] 6. The imaginary part of overline{z} is therefore frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

A naoish number (n) is defined as: - (n geq 90) - The second-to-last digit of (n) is (9) 2. **Modulo Analysis:** Every naoish number (n) can be written in the form (n = 90 + 10a + b) where (a) is a non-negative integer and (b) is a digit from (0) to (9). This means that modulo (100), a naoish number is congruent to one of ({-10, -20, -30, ldots, -90}). 3. **Target Modulo:** We need to express (2020) as a sum of naoish numbers. First, we find the modulo (100) of (2020): [ 2020 equiv -80 pmod{100} ] 4. **Greedy Algorithm:** To achieve (-80) modulo (100) using the fewest naoish numbers, we start by using the largest possible naoish number modulo (100), which is (-10). We need to sum up to (-80): [ -10 times 8 = -80 ] This means we need at least 8 naoish numbers to achieve (-80) modulo (100). 5. **Constructing the Sum:** We need to ensure that the sum of these naoish numbers equals (2020).

Let's take the side with length 26 cm as the base. We need to find the height, which is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite side. Since we know the angle between the sides (37 degrees), we can use the sine function to find the height (h). The height can be found by multiplying the length of the other side (14 cm) by the sine of the angle between the sides. h = 14 cm * sin(37 degrees) First, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians or use a calculator that can handle degrees directly. Most scientific calculators have a degree mode, so you can input the angle in degrees. sin(37 degrees) ≈ 0.6018 (rounded to four decimal places) Now, we can calculate the height: h = 14 cm * 0.6018 ≈ 8.4252 cm Now that we have the height, we can calculate the area of the parallelogram: Area = base * height Area = 26 cm * 8.4252 cm ≈ 219.0552 cm² So, the area of the parallelogram is approximately boxed{219.0552} square centimeters."},{"prompt":"rectangle ABCD, AB=2, BC=4.

Since a_n = x(2n - 1) + y(3n - 2) = (2x + 3y)n - (x + 2y), we can see that {a_n} is indeed an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of (2x + 3y). 2.

We can write this as: Remaining cows = C - (1/4)C = (3/4)C Remaining dogs = D - (3/4)D = (1/4)D The total number of animals remaining on the farm is 161, so we can write the equation: (3/4)C + (1/4)D = 161 Since C = 2D, we can substitute 2D for C in the equation: (3/4)(2D) + (1/4)D = 161 Now, let's solve for D: (3/2)D + (1/4)D = 161 To combine the terms, we need a common denominator, which is 4: (6/4)D + (1/4)D = 161 (7/4)D = 161 Now, multiply both sides by 4/7 to solve for D: D = (161 * 4) / 7 D = 644 / 7 D = 92 Now that we know there were initially 92 dogs, we can find the initial number of cows using the relationship C = 2D: C = 2 * 92 C = 184 Initially, there were boxed{184} cows at the farm."},{"prompt":"A triangle is inscribed in a circle.

We'll analyze the problem step by step. Step 1: Insight into Squaring Numbers First, consider the general form of any number: n = 10k + b where ( k ) represents the part of the number except for the last two digits and ( b ) represents the last two digits. The square of ( n ) is given by: n^2 = (10k + b)^2 Expanding this, we get: n^2 = 100k^2 + 20kb + b^2 Here, the last two digits of ( n^2 ) are determined by ( b^2 mod 100 ). Step 2: Identify Possible Last Digits To have the last two digits of ( n ) and ( n^2 ) match, ( b^2 mod 100 ) must equal ( b ). Let's analyze which digits satisfy this condition. 1. **Last digit analysis:** - Consider the numbers ending in 0 through 9. When squared, the last digit of the result should match the last digit of the number itself: - ( 0^2 = 0 rightarrow text{last digit 0} ) - ( 1^2 = 1 rightarrow text{last digit 1} ) - ( 2^2 = 4 rightarrow text{last digit 4} ) - ( 3^2 = 9 rightarrow text{last digit 9} ) - ( 4^2 = 16 rightarrow text{last digit 6} ) - ( 5^2 = 25 rightarrow text{last digit 5} ) - ( 6^2 = 36 rightarrow text{last digit 6} ) - ( 7^2 = 49 rightarrow text{last digit 9} ) - ( 8^2 = 64 rightarrow text{last digit 4} ) - ( 9^2 = 81 rightarrow text{last digit 1} ) Only 0, 1, 5, and 6 result in squares ending in the same last digit. Step 3: Analyze Last Two Digits Now, analyze the last two digits for each possible last digit found: 1. **For last digit 0:** - The last two digits can only be 00. (10x + 0)^2 = 100x^2 This indicates that the intermediate terms (20x times 0 ) and (0^2 ) contribute nothing. Thus, (00) satisfies the condition. 2. **For last digit 1:** - The last two digits can end in 01. (10y + 1)^2 = 100y^2 + 20y + 1 To match the last two digits: 20y + 1 equiv 1 pmod{100} [ begin{aligned} 20y + 1 & equiv 1 pmod{100}, 20y & equiv 0 pmod{100}, y &equiv 0 pmod{5}. end{aligned} ] Thus, (01) satisfies the condition. 3. **For last digit 5:** - The last two digits can only be 25. (10z + 5)^2 = 100z^2 + 100z + 25 Simplifies to (100z^2 + 100z + 25). Thus, (25) satisfies the condition. 4. **For last digit 6:** - The last two digits can end in 76. (10u + 6)^2 = 100u^2 + 120u + 36 To match the last two digits: [ begin{aligned} 120u + 36 & equiv 76 pmod{100}, 120u & equiv 40 pmod{100}, 60u & equiv 20 pmod{50}, 30u & equiv 10 pmod{25}, 6u & equiv 2 pmod{5} quad text{(Divide by each simplifying term's GCD)}, u &equiv 7 pmod{10}. end{aligned} ] Thus, (76) satisfies the condition.

First, let's find out how many dogs are not long-furred. Since there are 36 dogs with long fur out of 45, the number of dogs without long fur is: T - L = 45 - 36 = 9 dogs Now, out of these 9 dogs that do not have long fur, there are 8 dogs that are neither long-furred nor brown.

Since the 8 dogs that are neither long-furred nor brown are already accounted for in the 9 dogs without long fur, all of the remaining dogs with long fur must be brown. So, the number of long-furred brown dogs is the same as the total number of long-furred dogs, which is 36. Therefore, the total number of brown dogs (both long-furred and not long-furred) is: B = (number of long-furred brown dogs) + (number of not long-furred brown dogs) B = 36 + 1 B = 37 So, there are boxed{37} brown dogs in the kennel."},{"prompt":"Let min R, the line mxy3m+1=0 intersects with the line x+my3m1=0 at point Pleft(x,yright).

The product of the slopes is m cdot left(-frac{1}{m}right) = -1, indicating that the lines are indeed perpendicular to each other. Furthermore, by solving the system of equations given by the two lines, we find that they intersect at a point that lies on the circle with diameter MN, where M(3,1) and N(1,3). The equation of this circle can be derived as left(x-2right)^{2}+left(y-2right)^{2}=2. This disproves statement A since the circle described in A is left(x-2right)^{2}+left(y-2right)^{2}=8, which is different. To check if point P lies outside circle C: left(x+2right)^{2}+left(y+1right)^{2}=4, we calculate the distance between the centers of the two circles, which is sqrt{(-2-2)^{2}+(-1-2)^{2}}=5. Since this distance is greater than the sum of the radii of the two circles (sqrt{2}+2), point P indeed lies outside circle C, making statement B correct.

First, calculate the combinatorial coefficients: [ C_{5}^{2} = frac{5 cdot 4}{2} = 10, quad C_{3}^{2} = 3 ] Putting the values: [ T_{min} = 1 times 10 + 1 times 5 times 3 + 5 times 3 = 10 + 15 + 15 = 40 ] Therefore the minimal waiting time is: [ boxed{40 ; text{minutes}} ] 4. **To maximize the wasted time**, consider all Kopushas ahead of all Toropygas: ( a C_{n}^{2} + b m n + b C_{m}^{2} ) Again, substituting the specific values: ( T_{max} = 1 times 10 + 5 times 5 times 3 + 5 times 3 = 10 + 75 + 15 = 100 ) So the maximum waiting time is: [ boxed{100 ; text{minutes}} ] 5. **Expected total wasted time**: - Define (X_k) as the number of Kopushas in front of the (k)-th customer. - (mathbb{E}[X_k] = frac{(k-1)m}{m+n}). Using the waiting time formulation for the (k)-th customer: [ T_k = X_k b + left(k-1-X_kright) a ] Taking expectations: [ mathbb{E}[T_k] = (b-a) mathbb{E}[X_k] + a(k-1) = (b-a) frac{(k-1)m}{m+n} + a(k-1) = frac{bm + an}{m+n} cdot (k-1) ] Summing over all customers from (1) to (m+n): [ mathbb{E}[T] = frac{bm + an}{m+n} cdot left(0+1+2+ldots +(m+n-1)right) = frac{(bm+an)}{m+n} cdot frac{(m+n-1)(m+n)}{2} = C_{n+m}^{2} cdot frac{bm + an}{m+n} ] Substituting the given values: ( C_{8}^{2} cdot frac{5 cdot 3 + 1 cdot 5}{8} = 7 cdot 20 / 2 = 70 ) Hence the expected total waiting time is: [ boxed{70 ; text{minutes}} ]"},{"prompt":"One island tribe has a custom where, during a ritual dance, the shaman tosses three thin, straight rods of the same length, tied together in the shape of the letter П, high into the air.

This total revenue comes from the sale of the regular snakes and one super rare snake. If we subtract the sale of the super rare snake from the total revenue, we get the revenue from the regular snakes: 2250 - 1000 = 1250 Now, we know that each regular snake sells for 250, so we can find out how many regular snakes were sold by dividing the revenue from regular snakes by the price of each regular snake: 1250 / 250 = 5 So, there were 5 regular snakes sold. Since Jake has 3 snakes and each lays the same number of eggs, we can divide the number of regular snakes sold by the number of snakes Jake has to find out how many eggs each snake lays: 5 regular snakes / 3 snakes = 1.666... Since the number of eggs must be a whole number, we can't have a fraction of an egg. Therefore, we need to adjust our calculation to account for the super rare snake. The super rare snake is one of the eggs, so we have 5 regular snakes plus 1 super rare snake, making a total of 6 snakes sold.

Is it possible to remove all pieces from the board with several such moves?","completion":"To solve the problem, we will use a proof by contradiction. Here is the step-by-step explanation: 1. **Set up the problem**: Consider a board of size 22 times 23, where each of the cells contains exactly one piece. Initially, there are 22 times 23 = 506 pieces on the board. 2. **Restate the problem**: We need to determine whether it is possible to remove all the pieces from the board by making several valid moves. Each move consists of choosing two pieces and moving each to an adjacent cell, then removing exactly two pieces from any cell that contains two or more pieces. 3. **Color the board**: Color the board in a checkerboard pattern: alternate cells are colored black and white. Specifically, we start with the top-left cell being black. Hence, there are: - 11 times 23 = 253 black cells - 11 times 23 = 253 white cells 4. **Define the pieces**: Define a piece to be **black** if it is on a black cell and **white** if it is on a white cell. Initially, there are 253 black pieces and 253 white pieces. 5. **Analyze a move**: Each move consists of moving two pieces to adjacent cells. When moving a piece to an adjacent cell, it always changes color because adjacent cells are of different colors. For example, moving from a black cell to an adjacent white cell, it will become a white piece, and vice versa. 6. **Invariants**: Since each move changes the color of the pieces, moving two pieces will always preserve the parity (even or odd nature) of the count of pieces of each color: - Two pieces both change color, so the overall number of black and white pieces stays odd. 7. **Consequences for removal**: If a cell contains at least two pieces, both of the same color, removing them means reducing the count of pieces of that color by 2. This keeps the count odd. 8. **Contradiction**: - Initially, there are 253 black pieces and 253 white pieces, both odd. - Any operation of moving and removing pieces keeps both these counts odd. - Suppose we can remove all pieces from the board. This means that at some point, the number of remaining black and white pieces must both be zero, which is an even number. 9. **Conclusion**: The assumption that all pieces can be removed leads to a contradiction since the counts of black and white pieces cannot both be reduced to zero (an even number) while maintaining the invariant that their counts are odd.

Therefore, by the property of inscribed angles, we have: [ widehat{EAC} = widehat{BDE} quad text{and} quad widehat{AEC} = widehat{BED}. ] The first equality holds because ( widehat{EAC} ) and ( widehat{BDE} ) subtend the same arc ( overset{frown}{BD} ), and the second equality holds because they subtend the same arc ( overset{frown}{EC} ). 2. **Similarity of Triangles**: Using the angles found, triangles ( triangle EAC ) and ( triangle EBD ) are similar: [ triangle EAC sim triangle EBD. ] From the similarity, we can write the ratio of corresponding sides: [ frac{AC}{BD} = frac{AE}{BE}. ] This gives our first key relationship: [ frac{AC}{BD} = frac{AE}{BE}. tag{1} ] 3. **Second Pair of Similar Triangles**: Additionally, consider the angles subtended by the same arcs again.

Since the area of a square is given by the formula ( A = s^2 ), where ( s ) is the side length of the square, we can find the side length by taking the square root of the area. Given the area ( A = 7201 ) sq m, the side length ( s ) is: [ s = sqrt{7201} ] [ s = 84.8528137423857 ] meters (since the square root of 7201 is 84.8528137423857).

(Only one key at a time can be switched.)","completion":"Let's restate the problem in a clear form: We have a (4 times 4) grid of keys, where each key is either horizontally ((H)) or vertically ((V)) oriented. The goal is to turn all keys to the vertical orientation. When a key is toggled (i.e., switched from horizontal to vertical or vice versa), all the keys in the same row and column are also toggled. Here's the step-by-step detailed solution to show that it is always possible to open this lock, no matter what the initial configuration is: 1. **Objective**: We need to switch the orientation of a key an odd number of times to change its state (from (H) to (V)) while keeping other keys' toggles even (so their states remain unchanged). 2. **Row and Column Impact**: Consider a key ( K ) at ((i, j)). If we toggle ( K ): - ( K ) itself will be toggled 1 time. - All keys in ( K )'s row ((i)) except ( K ) will be toggled. - All keys in ( K )'s column ((j)) except ( K ) will be toggled. Therefore, toggling key ( K ) will toggle 1 key ( K ) itself and 6 additional keys (4 in the row plus 4 in the column minus 2 counting double keys twice) making a total of 7 toggles. 3. **Behavior Analysis**: - When we toggle a key and all its row and column keys, we: * Toggle the selected key ( K ) 1+6=7 times (odd number). * Toggle each remaining key in the same row and column 4 times (even number). * Toggle non-sister keys indirectly involved only 2 times (even number). 4. **Formal Argument**: - Choose any key ( K ) and toggle it and its row/column keys. - The key ( K ) will be toggled an odd number of times (7). - Every other key will be toggled evenly (either 2 or 4 times): * Keys in ( K )'s row or column (excluding ( K )) will toggle 4 times. * Keys not in ( K )'s row or column will be toggled 2 times. - Hence, by toggling one key and doing the same for each ( H )-oriented key iteratively ensures: * Each ( H ) gets turned into a ( V ) after 1 odd toggle. * All ( V )'s either remain ( V ) or return to ( V ) after being toggled an even number of times. 5. **Detailed Case Study**: - Consider ( K ) in the grid initially horizontal. - Toggle ( K ) and its row/column partners. - Save this configuration and check, each initially vertical ( V ) key will: * Stay ( V ) as each ( H )-correspond turned even. # Conclusion: Through the process described, each key ( K ) in the grid will eventually be toggled into a vertical pattern. By doing this to every initially horizontal key, we ensure the grid ends with all keys vertically placed, thus opening the lock successfully. The solution confirms toggling a key influences only neighbors even, ensuring all ( H )'s tuned ( V )'s ultimately. (blacksquare)"},{"prompt":"Frank invites his friends over to play video games.

Two parallel lines pass through these points respectively and intersect the hyperbola (y = frac{1}{x}).

Since O is the intersection of these diagonals, it must lie on the line segments joining these pairs of vertices. 4. **Symmetry and Regularity:** The regularity of the n-gon implies that the prism is symmetric about its center. The center of the prism is equidistant from all vertices of the n-gon on both the top and bottom faces. 5. **Circumcenters and Similarity:** Let X and Y be the circumcenters of the n-gon faces on the bottom and top, respectively. Since the n-gon is regular, X and Y are directly above each other and equidistant from all vertices on their respective faces. 6. **Ratio of Distances:** Let lambda be the ratio of the distance of O from the planes of the bottom and top n-gon faces. Since these planes are parallel, the ratio of distances from O to any corresponding pair of vertices on the top and bottom faces must be the same. 7. **Similarity and Proportionality:** The triangles formed by the diagonals and the center O are similar due to the regularity and symmetry of the prism. This implies that the distances from O to the vertices on the top and bottom faces are proportional. 8. **Equality of Distances:** Since the prism is regular and symmetric, the ratio lambda must be 1, meaning O is equidistant from the top and bottom faces.

Our goal is to determine the maximum number of such chords Kolia can draw. **Step-by-Step Explanation:** 1. **Calculate the distribution:** - Since we have 2006 points and 17 colors, we can calculate the number of points per color as follows: [ 2006 = 17 times 118 ] Therefore, each of the 17 colors is used to color exactly 118 points. 2. **Consider the coloring constraints:** - Notice that this means for each color, there are 118 points distributed around the circle. 3. **Apply a combinatorial strategy:** - We will use the pigeonhole principle and parity arguments. - We aim to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting chords with endpoints of the same color. 4. **Reduction to a simpler problem:** - Let's start by considering fewer points colored in exactly 2 colors, extending it gradually: - Assume (2k) points colored in 2 colors, each color having (k) points. - The goal is to find the number of non-intersecting chords. 5. **Applying the general theory for small (k):** - When we color the points around the circle using a cyclic ( mod 17 ) sequence, let's analyze how pairs (chords) are formed. - For example, for points (1, 2, cdots, 17k) numbered cyclically and then colored: [ text{Color point } i text{ (mod 17)} rightarrow i text{'s color} ] If we were to form such chords, each chord uses two points of the same color, and we need to ensure no chords intersect. 6. **Generalizing for actual problem setup:** - By painting the points cyclically and drawing non-crossing chords, it can be observed through combinatorial designs that the maximum number of such chords is achieved when we can form almost the maximal number possible for closest distribution: ( frac{n-1}{2} ). - Given ( 2006 ) points, a similar construction approach shows: - We reduce the problem for small (k) and generalize. - For ( 17 cdot 118 ): - Color points such that ( k = 118 ), maximizing non-intersecting pairs. - By optimal pairings ( k-1 = 117 ). 7. **Final Calculation:** From our considerations and combinatorial analysis, the maximum non-intersecting chords are found by: [ boxed{117} ]"},{"prompt":"Given y=f(x) has an inverse function y=f^{1}(x), and y=f(x+2), is the inverse function of y=f^{1}(x1), then the value of y=f^{1}(2010)f^{1}(1) is.","completion":"Given y=f(x+2), we have: x+2=f^{-1}(y) Therefore: x=f^{-1}(y)-2 Thus, the inverse function of y=f(x+2) is: y=f^{-1}(x)-2 Hence, f^{-1}(x-1)=f^{-1}(x)-2.

By expanding this using the sine formula for the sum of two angles, rearranging and combining terms, and applying the formula inversely, we get sin(B - A) = 0. Since the angles are interior angles of a triangle, this means the two angles are equal, leading to the conclusion that the triangle is an isosceles triangle. **Solution**: Given 2sin A cos B = sin C, we know 2sin A cos B = sin(A + B), therefore 2sin A cos B = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. therefore cos A sin B - sin A cos B = 0. therefore sin(B - A) = 0, because A and B are interior angles of the triangle, therefore B = A. Therefore, the correct choice is B. **Review**: In triangles, a significant number of problems can arise, and when applying concepts, it is crucial to grasp that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180^circ.

A possible way to ensure this is to consider symmetric or strategically spaced placements. 3. **Strategic Placement**: One potential method of placement is to use symmetry or patterns in such a way that it becomes difficult for any three nails to align collinearly. One such placement strategy involves ensuring that nails are positioned in a way that each belongs to different rows and columns, avoiding alignment along horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines. 4. **Important Concept**: By ensuring that nails are placed such that they form a uniform distribution or a non-linear pattern, we can prevent any three from lying on the same straight line. 5. **Specific Configuration and Verification**: The following 16 cells can be used: | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| | (1, 1) | (1, 5) | (2, 2) | (2, 6) | (3, 3) | (3, 7) | (4, 4) | (4, 8) | | (5, 1) | (5, 5) | (6, 2) | (6, 6) | (7, 3) | (7, 7) | (8, 4) | (8, 8) | We can see from these coordinates that no three of these points are collinear horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, thereby meeting our requirement. # Conclusion: From our careful symmetrical placement, ensuring each point falls within a pattern that avoids alignment, we can conclude that it is possible to place nails in the centers of 16 cells of an (8 times 8) chessboard such that no three nails lie on the same straight line. boxed{text{Можно.}}"},{"prompt":"(5 points) Given a=60.5, b=0.56, c=log_{10}0.56, then () A: c<b<a B: c<a<b C: b<a<c D: b<c<a","completion":"A Key point: Comparison of the magnitude of logarithmic values.

The cells are colored based on the condition that the number in a cell is smaller than one of its neighbors but larger than another. Consequently, only two cells remain uncolored. To find the minimal sum of the numbers in these two uncolored cells, let's break down the process: 1. **Identifying Uncolored Cells**: - The cells containing the minimum and maximum numbers in the 10 times 10 grid will definitely be uncolored because these numbers cannot both be smaller than one neighbor and larger than another. Specifically, let's denote the minimum value by ( m ) and the maximum value by ( M ). 2. **Positions of Uncolored Cells**: - In any configuration of the numbers, the minimum number ( m ) could be at any corner of the grid, considering that corners are constrained by fewer neighbors. Let's assume the two uncolored cells are located in opposite corners (for instance, (1,1) for the minimum and (10,10) for the maximum). 3. **Path Length Considerations**: - For any number ( n ) in the grid, the shortest path from that cell to the cell containing the minimum value cannot exceed ( n-1 ) steps. This is important to understand how paths and neighbors influence the placement of numbers. 4. **Summing up Distances**: - Considering that both minimal and maximal numbers respectively stand alone in a grid, their positions from the grid's corners sum up to substantial high path lengths. Summing distances across eight possible positions hints strongly that the minimal sum achieved through strategic placement is number 20. 5. **Conclusion**: - The primary observation here is that the minimum requirement for the corners and associated path lengths to any random number doesn't shift our resulting values from two theoretically accepted positions: - One must be the smallest number in the entire grid. - The other must be reached at a total not minimal shift influence that results further to 19.

Method 2 is based on the fact that a function's derivative is zero at its extreme points.

First, let's consider the function ( y = left| frac{a}{x} right| ) in the first quadrant where (x > 0) and (y > 0), since we are dealing with points that lie in this region. 2. For the given function, the points ((x, y)) must satisfy ( y = left| frac{a}{x} right| ) with both (x) and (y) being positive integers. 3. We need to find the number of such integer coordinate points ((x, y)) that lie under the curve ( y = left| frac{a}{x} right| ) and in the first quadrant, and check if this number equals 82. 4. Since ( y = frac{a}{x} ), we rearrange the equation to ( a = xy ). Therefore, the number of points ((x, y)) correspond to the number of solutions of ( xy = k ) where ( k ) is an integer, and ( k = a ). 5. The task can be translated into finding the sum of parts of the reciprocals up to the point where the product ( xy ) represents viable coordinate pairs. For each ( n in mathbb{N} ), the number of solutions of ( k = a ) is equivalent to counting the integer divisor pairs of ( a ): [ S(a) = sum_{n=1}^{lfloor sqrt{a} rfloor} left( leftlfloor frac{a}{n} rightrfloor right) ] where (lfloor cdot rfloor) denotes the floor function. 6.

It's a complex problem that covers multiple topics. Since E and F are the midpoints of AB and AC, the distance from EF to BC is half the distance from point A to BC. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is twice the area of triangle PBC. Given that the area of triangle ABC is 4, the area of triangle PBC is 2. The area of triangle PBC can also be calculated as dfrac{1}{2}PB times PC sin angle{BPC}, so PB times PC = dfrac{2}{sin angle{BPC}}.

To find the analytical expression of f(x) on mathbb{R}, we consider two cases based on the definition of an odd function, f(-x) = -f(x), and the given expression for f(x) when x > 0. - For x > 0, we are given that f(x) = x + frac{3}{x} - 4. - For x < 0, let's consider -x > 0.

The correct expression should maintain the odd function property, leading to: [ f(x) = -(-x - frac{3}{x} - 4) = x + frac{3}{x} - 4 ] However, considering the context of an odd function and the provided solution, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the interpretation. The correct approach for x < 0 should reflect the odd function property accurately, which means if f(x) = x + frac{3}{x} - 4 for x > 0, then for x < 0, we should directly apply the odd function property without altering the given expression's structure. Thus, the analytical expression for x < 0 was incorrectly modified in the solution provided. Given the nature of odd functions and the provided solution, the correct analytical expression across mathbb{R}, considering the odd function property and the initial condition for x > 0, should be: [ f(x) = left{begin{array}{ll} x + frac{3}{x} - 4 & text{for } x > 0 0 & text{for } x = 0 -(x + frac{3}{x} - 4) & text{for } x < 0 end{array}right. ] This respects the definition of an odd function, where f(-x) = -f(x).

Let us follow the steps to demonstrate this formally: 1. **Initial Setup**: We begin by setting up our points and understanding the operations: - We have points A_1, A_2, ..., A_n, and O. - Operation A: If a point A_i has at least 3 cards, we can take 3 cards and place 1 card each at A_{i-1}, A_{i+1}, and O. - Operation B: If point O has at least n cards, we can take n cards and place 1 card each at A_1, A_2, ..., A_n. 2. **Objective**: We want to show that if the total number of cards is at least n^2 + 3n + 1, it is possible to distribute the cards such that each point A_1, A_2, ..., A_n, O has at least n + 1 cards. 3. **Initial Card Distribution**: - Suppose the distribution of cards is represented by the array (c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n, c_O) where c_i represents the number of cards at point A_i and c_O represents the number of cards at point O. Given: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i + c_O geq n^2 + 3n + 1 ] 4. **Using Pigeonhole Principle**: - Notice that we need at least n + 1 cards at each of the n + 1 points. - If initially, any A_i or O has at least n + 1 cards, we have achieved the objective for that point. 5. **Applying Operations**: **Operation A**: - Consider that if any A_i has 3 or more cards, by this operation, we move one card each to A_{i-1}, A_{i+1}, and O. This does not decrease the total number of cards and ensures movement towards a more balanced distribution. **Operation B**: - If O has at least n cards, distributing these n cards to A_1, A_2, ..., A_n increases the card count at each A_i. 6. **Balancing and Minimum Cards Check**: - By performing Operations A and B iteratively: - If a point falls below having 3 cards, A is not applied to that point. - If O has less than n cards, B is not applied. But if A gives cards to O, it increases the possibility of applying B next. By the iterative adjustment and redistribution, the configuration moves towards every point having at least n + 1 cards. 7. **Convergence**: - Given the total cards exceed the threshold of n^2 + 3n + 1, and at each point where cards are moved around to make the minimal cards condition satisfied, eventually, all points will reach at least n + 1 cards due to the large surplus of total cards ensuring balance. # Conclusion: Thus, the step-by-step application of the operations A and B confirms that every point will indeed converge to having at least n + 1 cards eventually.

Prove that there exists a diameter which does not intersect this broken line. (Folklor )","completion":"1. Let ( O ) be the center of the circle, and let ( A ) and ( B ) be the given points on the circle. The broken line joining ( A ) and ( B ) is denoted by ( X_0, X_1, ldots, X_{n-1}, X_n ), where ( X_0 = A ) and ( X_n = B ). 2. Consider the ellipse ( varepsilon ) with foci at ( A ) and ( B ) that passes through the center ( O ) of the circle. By the definition of an ellipse, any point ( P ) on the ellipse satisfies the equation: [ PA + PB = text{constant} ] Specifically, for the ellipse passing through ( O ), we have: [ AO + OB = text{constant} ] 3. Since the broken line ( X_0, X_1, ldots, X_{n-1}, X_n ) is shorter than the diameter of the circle, we have: [ X_0X_1 + X_1X_2 + cdots + X_{n-1}X_n < AO + OB ] 4.

Since the broken line lies strictly inside the ellipse ( varepsilon ), consider the diameter of the circle that is tangent to the ellipse ( varepsilon ). This diameter will not intersect the broken line because the broken line is entirely contained within the ellipse, and the tangent diameter lies outside the ellipse except at the point of tangency. 6.

The length of the bridge is 1250 meters. How many minutes does it take for the man to cross the bridge?","completion":"First, we need to convert the man's walking speed from kilometers per hour (km/hr) to meters per minute (m/min) because the length of the bridge is given in meters. 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, and 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. So, to convert 5 km/hr to m/min: 5 km/hr = 5 * 1000 meters / 60 minutes 5 km/hr = 5000 meters / 60 minutes 5 km/hr = 83.33 m/min (approximately) Now that we have the man's walking speed in meters per minute, we can calculate the time it takes for him to cross the bridge, which is 1250 meters long.

The area of the floor (which is the same as the ceiling) is ( 15 times b ).

Given that |AB| = 4, we can assume without loss of generality that the points A and B lie on the x-axis such that A is located at (-2,0) and B at (2,0). Therefore, the midpoint O is at (0,0). The condition |PA| - |PB| = 3 represents a hyperbola with foci at points A and B, since the difference in distances from any point P on the hyperbola to the foci is a constant (which is 3 in this case). To find the minimum value of |OP|, we need to look for the vertex of the right branch of the hyperbola, since the distance from the center to this vertex will give us the minimum |OP|. The standard equation of a hyperbola with center (0,0) oriented along the x-axis is: frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 In this equation, 2a is the distance between the two vertices on the x-axis, which in our case is equal to 3 (because |PA| - |PB| = 3).

The center of C_1 is C_1(2, -1), and its radius is r=1. Let the symmetric point of C_1(2, -1) with respect to the line x-y-2=0 be C_2(m, n). For points to be symmetric with respect to the line x-y-2=0, the slope of the line connecting the point and its symmetric counterpart should be -1, because the line of symmetry has a slope of 1 (perpendicular slopes are negative reciprocals). Therefore, the slope connecting C_1(2, -1) and C_2(m, n) should be -1, expressed as frac{n+1}{m-2} = -1. Furthermore, the midpoint of the segment connecting C_1 and C_2 lies on the line x-y-2=0. This gives us a system of equations begin{cases} frac{n+1}{m-2} = -1 frac{m+2}{2}-frac{n-1}{2}-2 = 0end{cases}. Solving the system, we find begin{cases} frac{n+1}{m-2} = -1 m-n-4=0 end{cases}, which simplifies to begin{cases} m-2=-n-1 m-n-4=0 end{cases}. Hence, we have begin{cases} m=1 n=0 end{cases}. Thus, the center of C_2 is C_2(1, 0).

Since these digits are at the end, we can check potential sequences: - For example, ( n=5 )), the sequence is ( 5, 6, 7 ). 3. **Palindrome Condition for the First Five Digits**: - If the first five digits form a palindrome (let's denote it as ( a, b, c, b, a )) - Among these digits, the middle digit must be one of the three consecutive ones to fit. Let's place '1's based on prior information ( c=1 ). 4. **Containing three consecutive 1's**: - Three consecutive positions for 1s can be ( b=1 ).

Each room contains 3 lamps, and the lamps are themselves grouped in pairs (not necessarily in the same room). Each of these 3k pairs has a unique switch that controls the two lamps of the pair. Is there necessarily a configuration of the switches (on or off) that allows having at least one lamp on and one lamp off in each room?","completion":"The problem involves proving whether there exists a configuration of switches that ensure each room in a set of (2k) rooms has at least one lamp turned on and one lamp turned off. Each room has 3 lamps, and the total number of lamps across all rooms is (6k). The lamps are paired by switches, with each switch controlling a pair of lamps, resulting in (3k) pairs of lamps controlled by unique switches. To approach this, we employ a proof by induction. 1. **Base Case ( (k = 1)):** For (k = 1), we have (2 times 1 = 2) rooms and (6 times 1 = 6) lamps. Each room has 3 lamps, and thus we consider rooms (A) and (B) with lamps (A_1, A_2, A_3) and (B_1, B_2, B_3), respectively. Suppose (A_1) and (B_1) are controlled by the same switch: - If the switch is on, both (A_1) and (B_1) are on. - If the switch is off, both (A_1) and (B_1) are off. To ensure each room has one lamp on and one lamp off, we can configure the remaining switches such that: - One switch controls (A_2) and (B_2) - Another switch controls (A_3) and (B_3) There exists a configuration where in every room, at least one lamp is on and one is off by setting the switches appropriately. Therefore, the result holds for (k = 1). 2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the proposition holds for (k). That is, for (2k) rooms, there exists a switch configuration ensuring each room has at least one lamp turned on and one lamp turned off. Now, consider (2(k+1)) rooms (i.e., adding two more rooms): - We add (6) more lamps (for a total of (6(k+1)) lamps). Denote the new rooms as (A) and (B) with new lamps (A_1, A_2, A_3) and (B_1, B_2, B_3), respectively. 3. **Analysis of New Connections:** - Assume (A_1) and (B_1) are controlled by the same switch. **Case 1:** - If (A_2) and (B_2) are not connected, we can combine switches controlling (A_2) and (B_2) and (A_3) and (B_3). We can split the configuration of lamps in (2(k+1) - 2 = 2k) rooms into two groups, where one group of lamps is in room (A) and (B), and the remaining lamps are in the other (2k) rooms. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a switch configuration ensuring each room in other (2k) rooms has at least one lamp on and one lamp off. **Case 2:** - If (A_2) and (A_3) are connected within room (A), we handle the lamps similarly by appropriately combining switches controlling remaining pairs. - Similarly analyze if (A_2) and (B_3) are connected or (A_3) and (B_3) are connected, proceed with combinations ensuring switches are configured such that each room in (2(k+1)) rooms continues to have at least one lamp on and one lamp off. In every connection scenario, we verify that combined switches can be configured to meet the desired condition based on the inductive hypothesis. Thus, the configuration is always possible. Therefore, by induction, the proposition holds for any (kgeq 1). [ boxed{} ]"},{"prompt":"Use the bisection method to find the real root of the equation x^{3}2x5=0 in the interval [2,3].

Given that ( angle ABK = 2 angle KBC ), we want to prove that the lines ( FL ) and ( BC ) are perpendicular where: - ( F ) is the midpoint of ( AC ), - ( L ) is the projection of point ( A ) onto line ( BK ). 2. **Reflections and Midpoints**: Define point ( R ) as the reflection of point ( C ) with respect to line ( BL ), and let ( M ) be the midpoint of segment ( CR ). 3. **Parallel Lines**: Since ( AL ) and ( CR ) are both perpendicular to line ( BL ), they are parallel. Given that ( MC : AL = CK : AK = 1:2 ), it follows that ( CR = 2CM = AL ). 4. **Parallelogram Formation**: Thus, quadrilateral ( ALCM ) forms a parallelogram.

Since P' is the midpoint of the arc, it lies on the angle bisector AA_1.

Since P' lies on the bisector of BB_1, the segments B_1P' and BP' are equal (B_1P = BP as they subtend equal arcs). 4. Therefore, P' lies on the perpendicular bisector of BB_1, which by definition meets AA_1 at point P. This implies that P' = P.

Let the tangent line l touch the parabola at point M. We assume the coordinates of M to be left(frac{y_{0}^{2}}{2p}, y_{0}right), where y_{0} > 0. 1. The slope of line EM is calculated as follows: [ k_{EM} = frac{y_{0} - 0}{frac{y_{0}^{2}}{2p} + frac{p}{2}} = frac{2py_{0}}{y_{0}^{2} + p^{2}} ] 2. The equation of the tangent line at M is: [ x = frac{y_{0}^{2} + p^{2}}{2py_{0}}y - frac{p}{2} ] 3.

The discriminant Delta of this equation must be zero for the line to be tangent, leading to: [ Delta = left(frac{y_{0}^{2} + p^{2}}{y_{0}}right)^{2} - 4p^{2} = 0 ] Simplifying, we find (y_{0}^{2} - p^{2})^{2} = 0, which implies y_{0} = p and thus x_{0} = frac{p}{2}.

Extend side AB beyond point B such that BC serves as the bisector of angle B_1BK. As A_1 lies on the angle bisector angle BAC, it is equidistant from sides BB_1 and BC. 2. Considering point A_1 lies on the angle bisector angle BAC, it is equidistant from both sides of the angle angle BAC. Therefore, A_1 is equidistant from sides BC and AB, and thus it also lies on the bisector of angle BB_1C. 3. Similarly, B_1 and C_1 also lie on the respective angle bisectors.

Let's assume B gives C an x meters start in a 1000 meters race. Then, when B has run 1000 meters, C has run (1000 - x) meters. Their speeds ratio will still be 8/9: V_B / V_C = 1000 / (1000 - x) 8 / 9 = 1000 / (1000 - x) Now, we solve for x: 8 * (1000 - x) = 9 * 1000 8000 - 8x = 9000 -8x = 9000 - 8000 -8x = 1000 x = 1000 / -8 x = -125 Since we cannot have a negative start, we take the absolute value of x, which is 125 meters.

The sum of the degrees of all vertices in the graph is twice the number of edges. Therefore, [ sum text{degrees} = 2 times 23 = 46. ] 2. We consider cases based on the maximum vertex degree n. Case 1: Maximum degree n geq 7 - If a vertex has a degree of 7 or more, it is connected to at least 7 vertices. - None of these n neighbors can be connected to each other to avoid forming a triangle. This results in binom{n}{2} unusable edges. - Additionally, the vertex with degree n cannot connect to the 9 - n remaining vertices. This implies: [ binom{n}{2} + (9 - n) > binom{10}{2} - 23 = 22. ] When n geq 7: [ binom{7}{2} + (9 - 7) = 21 + 2 = 23, ] [ binom{8}{2} + (9 - 8) = 28 + 1 = 29, ] [ binom{9}{2} + (9 - 9) = 36 + 0 = 36. ] This contradicts the edge count constraint, so no valid graphs exist when n geq 7.

For community A, after placing student A, there is 1 position left, which can be filled by any of the remaining 5 students. So, there are 5 choices for community A. For community B and C, since students B and C cannot go to community C, we can first arrange the two students for community B. After excluding students A, B, and C, there are 3 students left, and we need to choose 2 out of them for community B, which can be done in binom{3}{2}=3 ways. The remaining 1 student and the 2 students who cannot go to community C (students B and C) will then go to community A and community C, respectively. Therefore, the total number of different arrangements is 5 times 3 = 15. However, we need to consider that each community will have 2 students, and the order of the students in each community does not matter. Since we have counted the arrangements where the order matters, we need to divide the total number by 2 for each community. But, since we have already correctly counted for community A by choosing only 1 out of 5 for the second position, we only need to adjust for communities B and C. This adjustment has been inherently considered in our calculation by choosing 2 out of 3 directly for community B, and thus no further division is necessary. So, the correct answer is 15, which is not listed among the options provided, indicating a mistake in the interpretation of the solution. Re-evaluating the process: - For community A: After placing student A, there are 5 choices for the second position. - For communities B and C: Since students B and C cannot go to community C, and considering the restriction that each community gets 2 students, the arrangement for communities B and C must be among the remaining 4 students (excluding the one chosen for community A and student A).

Correcting the approach: - For community A: Student A and one of the 5 remaining students, so 5 choices. - For community B and C: Since students B and C cannot go to community C, we only need to arrange the remaining 4 students into communities B and C, considering the restrictions. This results in fewer combinations than previously calculated due to the restrictions on students B and C. Given the mistake in the initial explanation and calculation, and based on the correct interpretation of the restrictions, the correct answer should align with the options provided.

Plugging in the values we have: 6615 = 6000(1 + 0.05/1)^(1*t) Now, we simplify and solve for t: 6615 = 6000(1 + 0.05)^t 6615 = 6000(1.05)^t Divide both sides by 6000 to isolate the term with t: 6615 / 6000 = (1.05)^t 1.1025 = (1.05)^t Now, we need to solve for t.

We will break down the possibilities systematically: Can three circles have only one common point? 1. Suppose three circles ( C_1 ), ( C_2 ), and ( C_3 ) intersect. If they have only one common point, ( P ), then each circle must intersect the others such that ( P ) is their only point of intersection. 2. For three circles to have only one common intersecting point, each pair of circles would intersect at exactly that point, ( P ). 3. However, by the properties of circles, any two circles can intersect at most in two points. Therefore, it's impossible for three circles to share exactly one common intersection point without having at least two points of intersection for each pair. Thus, three circles cannot have only one common point. Can three circles have only two common points? 1. Suppose three circles ( C_1 ), ( C_2 ), and ( C_3 ) intersect. For them to have only two common points, ( P ) and ( Q ), circles ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) intersect at ( P ) and ( Q ). 2. When circle ( C_3 ) intersects both ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) at both ( P ) and ( Q ), this implies that ( C_3 ) also passes through these two points. 3. This intersection scenario further implies all three circles must always intersect at these two points but have no additional points of intersection with each other. 4. However, similar to the previous case, any two circles typically intersect in exactly two points if they intersect at all. Adding a third circle cannot limit the total number of intersections to fewer than four points (two for each pair of circle intersections). Thus, three circles cannot have only two common points. Can three circles have only three common points? 1. Suppose three circles ( C_1 ), ( C_2 ), and ( C_3 ) intersect. For them to have exactly three common points ( P ), ( Q ), and ( R ), the combinations of circle pairs must happen such that each has at least one additional intersection point. 2.

Given that f(x) has three zero points, there must be only one zero point in the interval (0, +infty). Next, we let f(x) = 0 for x > 0. This leads to e^x = -ax. Geometrically, this means that the line y = -ax is tangent to the curve y = e^x. Let (x_0, y_0) be the point of tangency. We then have the system of equations: begin{cases}e^{x_{0}}=-a -ax_{0}=e^{x_{0}} end{cases} Solving this system of equations gives x_{0}=1 and a=-e."},{"prompt":"What is the local value of a digit in the product of the face value of 7 and the local value of 6 in 7098060, if the local value of 6 in the product is 6000?","completion":"First, let's find the face value of 7 and the local value of 6 in the number 7098060.

This means there exists a common difference ( r ) such that: [ b = a + r, quad c = a + 2r, quad d = a + 3r ] 2. **Express the Product:** The product of these four integers is: [ abcd = a(a + r)(a + 2r)(a + 3r) ] 3. **Assume the Product is a Perfect Square:** Suppose ( abcd ) is a perfect square. Then there exists an integer ( m ) such that: [ a(a + r)(a + 2r)(a + 3r) = m^2 ] 4. **Simplify the Expression:** Consider the product in pairs: [ (a(a + 3r))((a + r)(a + 2r)) ] Expanding each pair: [ a(a + 3r) = a^2 + 3ar ] [ (a + r)(a + 2r) = a^2 + 3ar + 2r^2 ] Therefore: [ abcd = (a^2 + 3ar)(a^2 + 3ar + 2r^2) ] 5. **Form a Quadratic Equation:** Let ( x = a^2 + 3ar ). Then: [ abcd = x(x + 2r^2) = x^2 + 2r^2x ] Since ( abcd = m^2 ), we have: [ x^2 + 2r^2x = m^2 ] 6. **Analyze the Equation:** The equation ( x^2 + 2r^2x = m^2 ) implies that ( x ) and ( 2r^2 ) must be such that their product plus ( x^2 ) is a perfect square. This is a strong condition on ( x ) and ( r ). 7. **Consider the Parity and Divisibility:** - If ( r ) is even, then ( a ) must be odd (since ( a ) and ( r ) are coprime). - If ( r ) is odd, then ( a ) can be either odd or even, but the structure of the equation ( x^2 + 2r^2x = m^2 ) must still hold. 8. **Use Lemmas to Show Contradiction:** - **Lemma 1:** There are no four integers ( m, n, u, v ) with ( gcd(m, n) = gcd(u, v) = 1 ) and ( mn = uv ) such that ( 9m^2 + n^2 = u^2 + v^2 ). - **Lemma 2:** There are no four integers ( m, n, u, v ) with ( n ) odd, ( gcd(m, n) = gcd(u, v) = 1 ) and ( mn = uv ) such that ( u^2 - v^2 = 8m^2 + n^2 ). Applying these lemmas, we can show that the conditions required for ( abcd ) to be a perfect square lead to contradictions. Specifically, the structure of the equations derived from the product ( abcd ) and the properties of Pythagorean triples imply that no such integers ( a, r ) exist that satisfy the conditions for ( abcd ) to be a perfect square. 9. **Conclusion:** Since the assumptions lead to contradictions, we conclude that the product ( abcd ) cannot be a perfect square.

After three minutes, which is equivalent to 3 times 60 = 180 seconds, we observe there are 275,562 bacteria in the jar. We need to find the initial number of bacteria. 2. **Converting Time to Tripling Events**: Since the bacteria triple every 20 seconds, and there are 180 seconds in three minutes, the number of tripling events is 180 div 20 = 9. This means the bacteria have tripled 9 times over the course of three minutes. 3. **Setting Up the Equation**: If we let n represent the initial number of bacteria, after 9 tripling events, the number of bacteria can be represented by the equation n cdot 3^9 = 275,!562. 4. **Calculating the Initial Number of Bacteria**: - We know that 3^9 = 19,!683, so we can rewrite the equation as 19,!683n = 275,!562. - To find n, we divide both sides of the equation by 19,!683, resulting in n = frac{275,!562}{19,!683}. 5. **Solving for n**: - Performing the division gives us n = 14.

In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?","completion":"First, let's calculate the total distance Bess's Frisbee travels. Since Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and it returns to her each time, each throw involves a round trip of 20 meters out and 20 meters back. So each throw is 20 + 20 = 40 meters. She does this 4 times, so the total distance for Bess's Frisbee is 4 * 40 = 160 meters. Now, let's calculate the total distance Holly's Frisbee travels. Since Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters each time and does not return it to her original position, each throw is just 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance for Holly's Frisbee is 5 * 8 = 40 meters. To find the total distance both Frisbees have traveled, we add the distances together: 160 meters (Bess's Frisbee) + 40 meters (Holly's Frisbee) = 200 meters.

Now, let's look at the intersection of (AM) and (BD): - The triangles ( triangle DAK ) and ( triangle BMK ) created by the intersection of (AM) and (BD) are similar due to the angles being the same. - Since (M) divides (BC) in the ratio (2:1), the corresponding linear dimensions involving point (K) and point (B) down (BD) must scale according to this division. (K) on (BD) thus creates (BK = frac{2}{5} BD) since it splits into similar segments also respecting this (2:3) ratio. 3.

We are also told that Buffy has the same number of whiskers as the average number of whiskers on the three other cats. This means: [ B = frac{P + S + J}{3} ] Since ( B = 40 ), we can write: [ 40 = frac{P + S + J}{3} ] Multiplying both sides by 3, we get: [ 120 = P + S + J ] Now, we know that Puffy has three times more whiskers than one of the cats, but we don't know which one. Let's assume Puffy has three times more whiskers than Juniper for now. So we can write: [ P = 3J ] We also know that Puffy has half as many whiskers as Scruffy, so: [ P = frac{1}{2}S ] From the above two equations, we can write: [ 3J = frac{1}{2}S ] Multiplying both sides by 2 to solve for ( S ), we get: [ S = 6J ] Now we have three equations: 1.

Therefore, the given inequality becomes: [ksin xcos x < x implies kcdot 2sin xcos x < 2x implies ksin 2x < 2x] Now, we need to examine the implication of k < 1 on this inequality. 1. **When k < 1**: It's known that sin 2x leq 1 for all x, and since k < 1, we have ksin 2x leq k < 1. Given that sin x < x for all x in (0, frac{pi}{2}), it follows that ksin 2x < 2x for all x in (0, frac{pi}{2}). This shows that if k < 1, then the inequality ksin xcos x < x always holds. 2. **Necessity of k < 1**: To determine if k < 1 is a necessary condition, we consider the behavior of the function f(x) = sin 2x - 2x in the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}). The function sin 2x is increasing in this interval, but since sin 2x leq 1 and 2x is also increasing, there exists a point where sin 2x < 2x.

There could be specific values of x and k where ksin xcos x < x holds even if k geq 1, especially near the lower bound of the interval.

Consider the expression: [ leftlfloor frac{n+1}{k} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n}{k} rightrfloor ] Write ( n ) in terms of quotient and remainder: [ n = kd + r quad text{with} quad 0 leq r < k ] Therefore, [ leftlfloor frac{n}{k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{kd + r}{k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor d + frac{r}{k} rightrfloor = d ] [ leftlfloor frac{n+1}{k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{kd + r + 1}{k} rightrfloor = leftlfloor d + frac{r + 1}{k} rightrfloor = d + leftlfloor frac{r+1}{k} rightrfloor ] 4.

Suresh can complete the job in 15 hours, so his work rate is ( frac{1}{15} ) of the job per hour. Ashutosh's work rate is ( frac{1}{A} ) of the job per hour. When Suresh works for 9 hours, he completes ( 9 times frac{1}{15} = frac{9}{15} ) of the job.

Ashutosh completes this remaining ( frac{6}{15} ) of the job in 8 hours, so his work rate is ( frac{6}{15} ) of the job per 8 hours.

Given ( K = sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}} ) and ( A = frac{a + b}{2} ), we need to prove that if (frac{K}{A}) is a positive integer, then (a = b). 2. First, let's express (frac{K}{A}) in terms of (a) and (b): [ frac{K}{A} = frac{sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}}}{frac{a + b}{2}} ] 3. Simplify the expression: [ frac{K}{A} = frac{sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}}}{frac{a + b}{2}} = frac{2 sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}}}{a + b} ] 4. Further simplification: [ frac{K}{A} = frac{2 sqrt{frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}}}{a + b} = frac{2 sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{sqrt{2} (a + b)} = frac{sqrt{2(a^2 + b^2)}}{a + b} ] 5. Since (frac{K}{A}) is a positive integer, let (frac{K}{A} = n) where (n) is a positive integer: [ n = frac{sqrt{2(a^2 + b^2)}}{a + b} ] 6. Square both sides to eliminate the square root: [ n^2 = frac{2(a^2 + b^2)}{(a + b)^2} ] 7. Multiply both sides by ((a + b)^2): [ n^2 (a + b)^2 = 2(a^2 + b^2) ] 8. Expand and simplify: [ n^2 (a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = 2(a^2 + b^2) ] 9. Distribute (n^2): [ n^2 a^2 + 2n^2 ab + n^2 b^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2 ] 10. Rearrange terms: [ n^2 a^2 + n^2 b^2 + 2n^2 ab - 2a^2 - 2b^2 = 0 ] 11. Group like terms: [ (n^2 - 2)a^2 + (n^2 - 2)b^2 + 2n^2 ab = 0 ] 12. Since (a) and (b) are positive integers, the only way this equation holds is if the coefficients of (a^2) and (b^2) are zero: [ n^2 - 2 = 0 implies n^2 = 2 implies n = sqrt{2} ] 13. However, (n) is supposed to be a positive integer, and (sqrt{2}) is not an integer. Therefore, the only way for (frac{K}{A}) to be an integer is if the terms involving (a) and (b) simplify in such a way that (a = b). 14. If (a = b), then: [ K = sqrt{frac{a^2 + a^2}{2}} = sqrt{a^2} = a ] [ A = frac{a + a}{2} = a ] [ frac{K}{A} = frac{a}{a} = 1 ] 15. Since 1 is a positive integer, the condition is satisfied.

The vertex of this parabola is at (1,2), which can be seen by analyzing the equation. The axis of symmetry of the parabola is a vertical line that passes through the vertex, hence at x=1. For a parabola that opens upwards, as is the case here, the function value y decreases as x moves away from the vertex to the left, and y increases as x moves away from the vertex to the right.

Since each vertex has 39 outgoing edges, you can choose any of them to start the path. - Continue choosing outgoing edges that have not been used yet and that do not form the reverse of an already used edge. - This process can continue until all possible outgoing edges from a vertex that satisfy the conditions have been used. 5. **Calculating the Maximum Length:** - Each vertex can connect to 38 other vertices without repeating an edge in the reverse direction (since using both (i, j) and (j, i) is not allowed). - Thus, from each vertex, you can potentially use 38 edges. - Additionally, you can use the last edge to either start or end the path, which adds 1 more edge to the count. 6. **Final Calculation:** - The maximum number of edges used from each vertex is 38 (one for each of the other vertices, not counting the reverse direction). - The path can start and end on different vertices, allowing for the use of one additional edge at the start and one at the end. - Therefore, the total number of edges used in the longest path is 38 times 38 + 2 = 1444 + 2 = 1446. - However, since each edge is counted twice (once for each direction), the actual number of distinct dominos used is frac{1446}{2} = 723. 7. **Conclusion:** - The length of the longest proper sequence of dominos that can be formed using the dominos of D_{40} is boxed{723}."},{"prompt":"Let n equal the number of sides in a regular polygon.

Hence, we start by setting the inequality: cos x- frac {1}{2} geqslant 0. 2. Adding frac {1}{2} to both sides, we get cos x geqslant frac {1}{2}. 3. Next, we need to determine the values of x that satisfy this inequality. The cosine function has a period of 2π, and its values range from -1 to 1. The inequality cos x geqslant frac {1}{2} is satisfied when x is in the interval [2kπ- frac {π}{3},2kπ+ frac {π}{3}] for all integers k. 4. Therefore, the domain of the function y= sqrt {cos x- frac {1}{2}} is the union of these intervals: [2kπ- frac {π}{3},2kπ+ frac {π}{3}], kinmathbb{Z}. 5.

The circle (x-2)^2+y^2=4 has its center at (2,0) and a radius of 2. Given that the chord length is 2, the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to the line of the asymptote must be sqrt{2^2 - 1^2} = sqrt{3} (because the chord length is the base of an isosceles triangle formed with the radius as its sides).

Hence, the lines are parallel when a=1, so \\"a=1\\" is a sufficient condition. For the lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal, so we set the slopes equal to each other to find the necessary condition(s) for the lines to be parallel: -frac{a}{2} = -frac{1}{a+1} Simplifying this equation, we get: a^2 + a = 2 Solving for a, we find: a^2 + a - 2 = 0 Factoring, we obtain: (a-1)(a+2) = 0 Hence, a = 1 or a = -2 are the solutions. Therefore, while \\"a=1\\" is a condition that makes the lines parallel, it is not the only condition—since \\"a=-2\\" also satisfies the condition for parallel lines. Thus, \\"a=1\\" is sufficient but not necessary to ensure the lines are parallel.

Since the slope of line AB is frac{2-1}{1-3} = -frac{1}{2}, the slope of the perpendicular bisector of line segment AB, denoted as k, is 2. Thus, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of line segment AB is y - frac{3}{2} = 2(x - 2). Simplifying this, we get 4x - 2y - 5 = 0. Hence, the answer is: boxed{4x - 2y - 5 = 0}.

After that, the cards are collected and shuffled again, but the marbles remain with the individuals. This process is repeated at least twice. It is known that at the end of the game, A, B, and C have 20, 10, and 9 marbles respectively, and B knows that he received r marbles in the last round.

Since each round distributes the numbers (p), (q), and (r) among three people, we have: [ n(p + q + r) = 20 + 10 + 9 = 39. ] 2. Given ( p < q < r ) and all are positive integers, the smallest possible sum ( p + q + r ) is the sum of the smallest three positive integers, which is: [ p + q + r geq 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. ] Also, since ( n geq 2 ), we need to find values of ( p + q + r ) that satisfy the given information. 3. To find ( n ): [ n(p + q + r) = 39. ] Considering ( p + q + r geq 6 ), let's try different ( n ): - If ( n = 2 ): [ 2(p + q + r) = 39 implies p+q+r = frac{39}{2} = 19.5 quad (text{not an integer}). ] - If ( n = 3 ): [ 3(p + q + r) = 39 implies p + q + r = frac{39}{3} = 13. ] Therefore, ( n = 3 ) and ( p + q + r = 13 ). 4.

This behavior matches the requirement of being monotonically increasing on the interval left(0,2right).

The discriminant Delta of this equation is given by: [ Delta = (1 - i)^2 - 4(m + 2i) ] Simplifying this, we get: [ Delta = 1 - 2i + i^2 - 4m - 8i = 1 - 2i - 1 - 4m - 8i = -4m - 10i ] For Delta to be a non-negative real number, the imaginary part must be zero.

For the discriminant to be non-negative, we focus on the real part, which must satisfy the condition for the equation to have a real root. Given the mistake in the direct approach to the imaginary part, we reconsider the condition for a real root: the discriminant itself doesn't need to be real, but its square root, which determines the roots, must yield real results. This occurs when the discriminant is a complete square in the complex numbers, which was not directly addressed. Given the error in the initial explanation, the correct approach involves ensuring that the equation's coefficients and the conditions for real roots are correctly applied, typically requiring the discriminant to be a perfect square or the equation to be structured to ensure real roots through other properties. Given this, without the correct direct calculation or condition application leading to the real root requirement, the provided solution steps incorrectly conclude the process for determining m. The correct approach would involve detailed analysis of the discriminant's properties in relation to real and imaginary parts, ensuring real roots through proper quadratic equation analysis. Therefore, without the correct discriminant analysis or a misstep in the logical process, the solution inaccurately navigates the conditions for m to ensure a real root, leading to an incorrect or incomplete solution process. The correct value of m, following the proper analysis for real roots involving the discriminant and ensuring the equation's conditions are met, should be determined by correctly applying quadratic equation principles and ensuring the discriminant's properties align with real root conditions.

This is because if Q(x) were reducible, say Q(x) = g(x)h(x), then P(x) = x^9 Qleft(frac{1}{x}right) = x^9 gleft(frac{1}{x}right) hleft(frac{1}{x}right) would also be reducible, which contradicts the irreducibility of P(x). 5. **Pairing Numbers**: - We can pair each 10-digit number overline{d_9d_8cdots d_0} with its reverse overline{d_0d_1cdots d_9}. - If P(x) is irreducible, then Q(x) is also irreducible, and vice versa. 6. **Palindromic Numbers**: - If a number is a palindrome, i.e., overline{d_9d_8cdots d_0} = overline{d_0d_1cdots d_9}, then P(x) is symmetric. - For a palindromic polynomial P(x), P(x) = x^9 Pleft(frac{1}{x}right). - If P(x) is palindromic, then P(-1) = 0 because d_i(-1)^i + d_{9-i}(-1)^{9-i} = (-1)^i(d_i - d_i) = 0 for all i, implying P(x) is divisible by x+1, making it reducible. 7. **Conclusion**: - Since palindromic numbers lead to reducible polynomials, they do not contribute to the count of irreducible polynomials. - Therefore, the irreducible polynomials can be paired with their reverses, ensuring that the total number of such polynomials is even. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given a geometric sequence {a_n} with a common ratio of q, the system of linear equations in x and y begin{cases} a_{1}x+a_{3}y=2 a_{2}x+a_{4}y=1 end{cases} has a solution under which of the following statements is correct?

In the context of factoring, this often relates to the discriminant or the specific structure of a quadratic equation that allows for integer or rational roots.

Assume for (n = k), (f_k(x)) has at least (k) zeroes (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k) where (1 leq x_1 < x_2 < cdots < x_k < 2). 3. Consider (n = k+1): - First, the zeroes of (f_k(x)) are preserved through (f_{k+1}(x) = f(f_k(x))), implying (f_{k+1}(x)) inherits at least (k) zeroes from (f_k(x)). 4. Furthermore, since (f(x) = x(x-1)), we have: f_k(x) = 0 text{ for those zero points } x_1, x_2, ldots, x_k Evaluate (f_k(2) = 2); since (f_{k}(x)) is continuous on ([1, 2]), there must exist a point (bar{x} in (x_k, 2)) such that (f_k(bar{x}) = 1). This follows from the intermediate value theorem: f_k(1) = 0 text{ and } f_k(2) = 2 5. Then: f_{k+1} (bar{x}) = f(f_k(bar{x})) = f(1) = 0 Thus, there is an additional zero in ((x_k, 2)). Therefore, (f_{k+1}(x)) has at least (k+1) zeroes. By mathematical induction, for any (n), (f_n(x)) will have at least (n) zeroes in the interval ([1, 2]). **Conclusion:** boxed{text{When (1 leq x leq 2), (f_n(x)) has at least (n) zeroes.}}"},{"prompt":"Given the circle O: x^2 + y^2 = 1 and the following three functions: ①f(x) = x^3; ②f(x) = tan(x); ③f(x) = xsin(x), among these, the functions whose graphs can bisect the area of circle C are ( ) A: 3 functions B: 2 functions C: 1 function D: 0 functio","completion":"The circle O is symmetric about the origin O.

By the geometric meaning of the parameter in the parametric equations of a line, a fixed point exists where the value of t does not affect the position of the point on the line. The x-coordinate of the fixed point can be constant only if the term involving t (which is lt) is always zero, regardless of the value of t. Since l is a constant and we want the term lt to be always zero for all t, it must be that l is equal to zero because the only number that remains zero after multiplication with any t is zero itself. With l=0, the parametric equations become: begin{cases} x=-2 y=3+4t end{cases} Now, we can see that x is always -2, regardless of the value of t. The y-coordinate depends on t; however, since we are looking for a fixed point, we focus on the constant term in the y component, which is 3.

First, let's calculate the derivative of f(x): [ f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(2 - xe^{x}) = frac{d}{dx}(2) - frac{d}{dx}(xe^{x}). ] The derivative of a constant is zero, so frac{d}{dx}(2) = 0. For frac{d}{dx}(xe^{x}), we have to use the product rule: [ frac{d}{dx}(xe^{x}) = e^{x} cdot frac{d}{dx}(x) + x cdot frac{d}{dx}(e^{x}) = e^{x} + xe^{x}. ] Hence, the derivative is [ f'(x) = 0 - (e^{x} + xe^{x}) = -(1 + x)e^{x}. ] Now, we evaluate the derivative at the point (0,2) to find the slope of the tangent line there: [ k = f'(0) = -(1 + 0)e^{0} = -1. ] Since the point of tangency is (0,2) and the slope of the tangent line is k = -1, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line: [ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), ] where (x_1, y_1) is the point of tangency and m is the slope. Plugging in our values gives us: [ y - 2 = -1(x - 0), ] Simplifying, we get the equation of the tangent line: [ y = -x + 2. ] For a standard linear equation, we can write this as: [ x + y - 2 = 0. ] So, the equation of the tangent line to the curve f(x) = 2 - xe^{x} at the point (0,2) is boxed{x + y - 2 = 0}."},{"prompt":"Part of the digits in the rectangle have already been set.

This means that the sales tax Jerry paid is 6% of the total worth of taxable items ( T ). So, the sales tax Jerry paid is ( 0.06T ). Since the sales tax is 30% of the total amount spent, we can write: [ 0.06T = 0.30 times (T + F) ] We know that ( F = 39.7 ), so we can substitute ( F ) into the equation: [ 0.06T = 0.30 times (T + 39.7) ] Now, let's solve for ( T ): [ 0.06T = 0.30T + 0.30 times 39.7 ] [ 0.06T - 0.30T = 0.30 times 39.7 ] [ -0.24T = 0.30 times 39.7 ] [ T = frac{0.30 times 39.7}{-0.24} ] [ T = frac{11.91}{-0.24} ] [ T = -49.625 ] However, the total worth of taxable items cannot be negative, which indicates there's a mistake in our calculation.

Points D and E on sides AB and BC of triangle ABC, respectively, are positioned such that AD = BE = x. Also given, AB = BC = AC = 3 units and AD = 3 - 1 = 2 units. So, we set AD = BE = 2. After folding, triangles ACD and BCE will overlap. Since ABC is an equilateral triangle, angles BAC, CBA, and CAB are all 60^circ. After the fold, line AC and line BC coincide making triangles DAC and EBC congruent to each other. This congruence and triangle properties imply that the coordinates of points D and E onto line AC due to the fold maintains triangle symmetry. The segment DE becomes a straight line across the coincided line segment AC = BC, adding to the length s = AD + BE = 4. After the fold, angle angle ADE and angle BEC (originally angles angle ADC and angle ECB) reflect the internal angles of equilateral triangle formed by the points D, E, C on line AC. Since both segments AD and BE are now part of the one side of a larger equilateral triangle inside, we analyze this triangle using known equilateral triangle properties and symmetry.

The perpendicular dropped from point (T) to the line (A_1B_1) intersects the line (CC_1) at point (K). A line through (C_1) parallel to (OK) intersects the segment (CO) at point (L). We need to find the angle (angle CLA_1). 4. Let us define the angles of triangle (ABC) as follows: (angle BAC = alpha) and (angle ACB = gamma). 5. Triangles (AOT) and (BOT) are congruent by the SSS (Side-Side-Side) congruence criterion because (TA) and (TB) are tangents to the circumcircle from point (T), and both have the same radius distance (AO = BO). 6. In circle geometry, the inscribed angle ( angle ACB ) subtended by arc (AB) is half of the central angle ( angle AOB) subtended by the same arc. Therefore, [ gamma = angle ACB = frac{1}{2} angle AOB = angle TOB. ] Consequently, the ratio (frac{OB}{OT}) equals (cos gamma). 7. Consider the triangle (BOC). As ( angle BOC = 2 alpha ), and since (BOC) is an isosceles triangle ( ( BO = OC = R ), the circumradius), it follows that: [ angle BCO = 90^circ - frac{1}{2} angle BOC = 90^circ - alpha. ] 8. Since the quadrilateral ( AB_1A_1B ) is cyclic (both (angle AA_1B = 90^circ ) and (angle AB_1B = 90^circ )), [ angle BAC = angle CA_1B_1. ] This equivalence implies: [ angle BCO = 90^circ - angle BAC = 90^circ - angle CA_1B_1, ] leading to the conclusion that lines (A_1B_1) and (CO) are perpendicular. 9. Hence, the lines (CO) and (TK) are parallel, meaning the quadrilateral (COTK) forms a parallelogram. In this shape: [ CK = OT. ] 10. Applying Thales' theorem to the segments and distances involved, we have: [ frac{CL}{CC_1} = frac{CO}{CK} = frac{OB}{OT} = cos gamma. ] 11. Thus, [ CL = CC_1 cos gamma = AC sin alpha cos gamma = CA_1 sin alpha = CA_1 sin angle CA_1B_1. ] So, point (L) is the base of the perpendicular dropped from (C) to (A_1B_1). 12.

Menelaus' theorem states that for a triangle ( triangle ABC ) and a transversal cutting ( triangle ABC ) at points ( D, E, F ) (where ( D ), ( E ), ( F ) are on ( BC ), ( CA ), ( AB ) respectively), the following relation holds: [ frac{AD}{DB} cdot frac{BE}{EC} cdot frac{CF}{FA} = 1 ] 3. **Applying Menelaus' Theorem to ( triangle OO_1O_2 ):** In our scenario, triangle ( triangle OO_1O_2 ) is intersected by the transversal ( A_1X A_2 ) such that: - ( A_1 ) is on ( OO_1 ), - ( X ) is the intersection of ( O_1O_2 ) and ( A_1A_2 ), - ( A_2 ) is on ( OO_2 ). 4. **Setting Up the Proportions:** According to Menelaus' theorem, we get the following proportion: [ frac{O_1X}{O_2X} cdot frac{O_2A_2}{OA_2} cdot frac{OA_1}{O_1A_1} = 1 ] 5. **Simplifying the Proportions:** Let's denote the radii of the circles ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) as ( R_1 ) and ( R_2 ) respectively. Considering that ( A_1 ) is a point of tangency on circle ( S_1 ) and similarly ( A_2 ) on ( S_2 ), we have: [ frac{O_2A_2}{OA_2} = frac{R_2}{OA_2}, quad text{and} quad frac{OA_1}{O_1A_1} = frac{OA_1}{R_1} ] Thus, the simplified proportion becomes: [ frac{O_1X}{O_2X} cdot frac{R_2}{OA_2} cdot frac{OA_1}{R_1} = 1 ] 6. **Establishing the Relationship Between Centers and Radii:** We note that for the points of tangency and the centers of circles ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ): [ O_1X = R_1, quad text{and} quad O_2X = R_2 ] Hence, we substitute these into the Menelaus' theorem: [ frac{R_1}{R_2} cdot frac{R_2}{OA_2} cdot frac{OA_1}{R_1} = 1 implies 1 = 1 ] This identity holds true, which proves the alignment. # Conclusion: Therefore, we have shown that the line ( A_1A_2 ) indeed passes through the intersection point ( X ) of the common external or internal tangents to the circles ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ). Hence, our solution is concluded, and the given geometric property is affirmed.

Prove that: l passes through a fixed point.","completion":"Solution: (Ⅰ) From the given conditions, we have 2pm=1, which implies m= frac {1}{2p}. According to the definition of a parabola, we get |PF|=m-(- frac {p}{2})= frac {1}{2p}+ frac {p}{2}. Given that frac {1}{2p}+ frac {p}{2}= frac {5}{4}, solving this equation yields p= frac {1}{2} or p=2 (discard this solution). Therefore, the equation of C is y^{2}=x. (Ⅱ) Proof 1: Assume the slope of line PA is k (clearly kneq 0), then the equation of line PA is y-1=k(x-1), thus y=kx+1-k. By solving begin{cases} y=kx+1-k y^{2}=x end{cases} and eliminating y, we get k^{2}x^{2}+[2k(1-k)-1]x+(1-k)^{2}=0. Let A(x_{1},y_{1}), by Vieta's formulas, we have 1times x_{1}= frac {(1-k)^{2}}{k^{2}}, i.e., x_{1}= frac {(1-k)^{2}}{k^{2}}. y_{1}=kx_{1}+1-k=kcdot frac {(1-k)^{2}}{k^{2}}+1-k=-1+ frac {1}{k}. Thus, A( frac {(1-k)^{2}}{k^{2}},-1+ frac {1}{k}). Given that the slope of line PB is frac {1}{k}. Similarly, we get B( frac {(1- frac {1}{k})^{2}}{( frac {1}{k})^{2}},-1+ frac {1}{ frac {1}{k}}), i.e., B((k^{2}-1)^{2},k-1). If the slope of line l does not exist, then frac {(1-k)^{2}}{k^{2}}=(k-1)^{2}. Solving this yields k=1 or k=-1. When k=1, the slopes of lines PA and PB are both 1, points A and B coincide, which contradicts the given conditions; When k=-1, the slopes of lines PA and PB are both -1, points A and B coincide, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, the slope of line l must exist. The equation of line l is y-(k-1)= frac {k}{(k-1)^{2}}[x-(k-1)^{2}], i.e., y= frac {k}{(k-1)^{2}}x-1. Thus, line l passes through the fixed point (0,-1). Proof 2: From (1), we have P(1,1). If the slope of l does not exist, then l is perpendicular to the x-axis. Let A(x_{1},y_{1}), then B(x_{1},-y_{1}), y_{1}^{2}=x_{1}.

(x_{1}-1neq 0, otherwise, x_{1}=1, then A(1,1), or B(1,1), line l passes through point P, which contradicts the given conditions) Given that frac {1}{1-x_{1}}=1, so x_{1}=0. At this point, points A and B coincide, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, the slope of l must exist. Assume the slope of l is k (clearly kneq 0), let l: y=kx+t, Since line l does not pass through point P(1,1), we have k+tneq 1. By solving begin{cases} y^{2}=x y=kx+t end{cases} and eliminating y, we get k^{2}x^{2}+(2kt-1)x+t^{2}=0. By the discriminant triangle =1-4kt > 0, we get kt < frac {1}{4}.

Given that frac {k^{2}x_{1}x_{2}+k(t-1)(x_{1}+x_{2})+(t-1)^{2}}{x_{1}x_{2}-(x_{1}+x_{2})+1}=1. Thus (k^{2}-1)x_{1}x_{2}+(kt-k+1)(x_{1}+x_{2})+t^{2}-2t=0③ Substituting ①② into ③ and simplifying yields frac {1-t^{2}-kt-k}{k^{2}}=0, i.e., 1-t^{2}-kt-k=0.

Proof 3: From (1), we have P(1,1). Let l: x=ny+t, since line l does not pass through point P(1,1), we have n+tneq 1. By solving begin{cases} y^{2}=x x=ny+t end{cases} and eliminating x, we get y^{2}-ny-t=0. Given that the discriminant triangle =n^{2}+4t > 0.

This is a classic problem of distributing items into boxes where each box must contain at least one item. Given that each of the remaining 3 students can choose to go to any of the 3 units, without any restrictions, there are 3^3 = 27 ways to distribute them. However, this count includes the scenarios where all three students might end up in the same unit, which violates the condition that each unit must have at least one person. To correct for this, we need to subtract the scenarios where all three students go to the same unit. There are 3 units, and for each unit, there is 1 way to place all three students into that unit, totaling 3 times 1 = 3 scenarios to be subtracted. However, we've also subtracted the scenarios where two students are in one unit and the third is in another, which also violates our conditions. To adjust for this, we need to add these scenarios back. For each pair of units, there are 2^3 = 8 ways to distribute the three students (each student has 2 choices), but this count includes the scenario where all three students are in the same unit, which we don't want. Since there are 3 pairs of units, we initially add back 3 times 8 = 24 scenarios. But we've counted the scenario where all three students are in the same unit three times (once for each pair of units), so we need to subtract 2 for each of these overcounts, resulting in 24 - 2 times 3 = 18 valid scenarios to add back. Therefore, the total number of distribution plans is 27 - 3 + 18 = 42. However, this calculation does not directly apply to our original problem statement due to an oversight in the explanation process.

The journalist asks person A the question: \\"Do you know B?\\" 3. If person A answers \\"yes,\\" then we can conclude that B is not Z, because Z is known by no one. 4. If person A answers \\"no,\\" then we can conclude that A is not Z, because Z knows everyone. 5. In either case, one person is identified as not being Z. Thus, by asking one question, the journalist eliminates one person from being Z. By repeating this process, each time asking about a different person, the journalist can systematically eliminate everyone except the one person who must be Z. Conclusion: The journalist can identify Z by asking fewer than n questions, but exactly n-1 questions are often enough in the worst-case scenario. This is because the last person remaining uneliminated must be Z. # Part (b) To find the minimum number of questions sufficient to determine Z and prove that fewer than this number of questions is insufficient: 1. Suppose at some step of the questioning, person A is asked whether they know person B. 2. If A answers \\"yes,\\" then B is marked as known, and consequently, it is known that B is not Z. If A answers \\"no,\\" then A is marked as known, meaning A cannot be Z. 3. After this question is answered, one person is permanently eliminated from consideration as Z since they either know someone or are known by someone. 4. To ensure all persons except one can be eliminated, a total of n-1 questions need to be asked in the worst-case scenario, as each question eliminates exactly one possibility. Now, let's show why n-1 questions are necessary: 1. After n-2 questions, there are still at least two people remaining who have not been conclusively eliminated as Z. 2. Let X be one of the remaining uneliminated persons. 3. The journalist already knows something about who knows whom among the questioned individuals. 4. By adjusting the knowledge such that X knows all remaining people, and no unanswered question contradicts existing knowledge, it is possible to make X be Z within the constraints given. Thus, if fewer than n-1 questions are asked, there remain at least two people, either of whom could potentially be Z.

This is because if a set ( S ) has exactly two members, the average of ( S ) is the midpoint of the two members, which must be an integer if the average is an integer.

(A) 0 (B) 6 (C) 8 (D) 24 (China High School Mathematics League, 1989)","completion":"1. First, we are considering a rectangular cuboid that has 8 vertices. We want to count the number of acute-angled triangles that can be formed from any 3 of these vertices. We start by calculating the total number of triangles that can be formed from these 8 vertices. [ text{Total number of triangles} = binom{8}{3} = frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = 56 ] 2. These triangles can either be right-angled triangles or acute-angled triangles, as the problem suggests. To determine how many are right-angled, consider any vertex of the rectangular cuboid. For every vertex, there are exactly 3 edges meeting at a right angle. 3. At each vertex, a right-angled triangle is formed by selecting any two of these three incident edges. Thus, each vertex forms 3 right-angled triangles. [ text{Right-angled triangles per vertex} = 3 ] 4. Given there are 8 vertices: [ text{Total right-angled triangles} = 3 times 8 = 24 ] 5. Note that each right-angled triangle has been counted three times (once at each vertex of the triangle). Thus, we divide by 3 to get the actual number of unique right-angled triangles: [ text{Unique right-angled triangles} = frac{24}{3} = 8 ] 6. Therefore, the number of right-angled triangles is 6 per vertex, across 8 vertices. [ text{Total right-angled triangles} = 8 times 6 = 48 ] 7. The complement of the total triangles gives us the acute-angled triangles because as the total number of triangles minus the right-angled triangles: [ text{Acute-angled triangles} = 56 - 48 = 8 ] 8.

We will estimate the total number of ordered pairs of acquaintances (t, s), where t is an arbitrary person and s is a person from S. For each s_0 in S, the number of pairs of the type (t, s_0) is not less than 0.3 |N|. Therefore, the total number of pairs is at least 0.3|S||N|. Thus, for some person t_0, the number of pairs of the type (t_0, s) is not less than 0.3|S|, which proves the lemma. **Election Process:** 1. Assume we nominate an arbitrary resident A as the first candidate. 2. Consider the set S of residents who are not acquainted with A. 3.

Set up the equation: [ q^p - 1 = 2(q+1) ] 3. **Simplify the Equation:** Solve for ( q ): [ q^p - 1 = 2q + 2 ] [ q^p - 2q - 3 = 0 ] Factorize: [ q (q^{p-1} - 2) = 3 ] 4. **Solve for ( q ):** Since ( q ) divides 3 and ( q ) is a prime number: [ q = 3 ] Substitute ( q = 3 ) back: [ 3^{p-1} - 2 = 1 ] [ 3^{p-1} = 3 ] Therefore: [ p - 1 = 1 Rightarrow p = 2 ] 5. **Set Up Equations for ( M ) and ( N ):** Assume ( M = overline{abcd} ): [ M = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 2 cdot 3^3 cdot r = 2 cdot 27 cdot r = 54r ] Similarly, ( N = overline{dcba} ): [ N = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a = 3^5 cdot r = 243r ] 6. **Eliminate ( r ) from the Equations:** Set up and solve the relation: [ 1000a + 100b + 10c + d = 54r ] [ 1000d + 100c + 10b + a = 243r ] Subtract the two equations: [ 999d + 90c - 90b - 999a = 189r ] Simplify to: [ (d - a) = frac{90(b - c) + 189r}{999} ] 7. **Choose Digit Values:** Considering digit constraints ( 0 leq a, b, c, d leq 9 ), observe: [ 216 = 54 cdot 4 ] [ 999d = 10c + 181d ] 8. **Check Possible Values for ( a ) and ( d ):** For: [ 818a + 80b = 10c + 181d ] [ 10(82a + 8b - c - 18d) = 2a + d = 10 ] 9. **Verify Each Combination:** If ( a = 1 ): [ 818 leq 10 cdot 9 + 181 cdot 9 = 1719 ] [ a < 3 Rightarrow a text{ could be } 1 text{ or } 2 ] For ( a = 1 ), ( d = 8 ): [ 8b = 63 + c Rightarrow c = 1 text { or } 9, text{ hence } b = 8 text{ or } 9 ] Thus, ( M = 1818 ) or ( 1998 ).

Hypothesis: From examining specific cases, we conjecture that the point R is the reflection of point E across the line e. Detailed Steps: 1. **Case with P inside the circle k:** - Let P be a point inside the circle k but distinct from O. - Using the diagram references, in triangle triangle EOQ, since PQ intersects the circle k again at Q, we have: angle OQP = angle OEP - Due to the symmetry relative to the line e, we also have: angle ORP = angle OEP - Thus, overline{OP} subtends the same angle from Q and R. Since Q and R are on the same side of overline{OP}, the points O, P, Q, R lie on the same circle. 2. **Case with P outside the circle k:** - Let P be a point outside the circle k. - Similarly, using diagram (2/a), if we denote the angle alpha, we have: angle OQP = 180^circ - alpha angle ORP = 180^circ - alpha - Therefore, the quadrilateral OPQR is a cyclic quadrilateral. 3. **Special Cases:** - **P coincides with O:** - If P = O, it follows that Q coincides with E or Q and R are identical on the circle (refer to 3/a or 3/b). - **P on the circumference of k:** - If P is on k, treating P as the intersection of the secant PE and k, we have P equiv Q, so O, P, Q, and R lie on a circle. - **PE is tangent to k at E (when E = Q):** - The angle OEP = 90^circ. By Thales' theorem, O, P, and the reflected point R form a circle (refer to diagram (4)). Conclusion: Therefore, in each case, we have shown that the points O, P, Q, and R lie on a common circle for any placement of P on the line e. The point R is the reflection of E across the line e.

Furthermore, since f'(x) = 3(m-3)x^2 + 9 geq 0 holds true for all x in (-infty, +infty), we need 3(m-3) geq 0 along with f'(0) geq 0. Solving this, we find that m geq 3.

This will help visualize and analyze the arrangement of the bricks. 3. **Counting the unit cubes and their colors**: - The volume of the parallelepiped is calculated as: [ 11 times 12 times 13 = 1716 text{ unit cubes} ] - Since we are coloring in a checkerboard pattern, half of these cubes will be one color (say white) and the other half will be the opposite color (say black).

This is because the sum of 429 odd numbers is odd. - But from step 3, we know exactly half (i.e., 858) of the total unit cubes should be white, which is clearly an even number. 7. **Conclusion**: - The contradiction arises because 858 is even while the predicted number of white cubes based on brick structure is odd.

Each domino covers 2 squares, leading to a total coverage of 9 times 2 = 18 squares, leaving 7 squares uncovered, which makes it crowded as more dominoes can't be added without overlapping or splitting. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_3fc4f3a6ef7302a792fcg-28.jpg?height=368&width=368&top_left_y=1323&top_left_x=720) 2. **Supposition and Division**: - Assume there is a configuration that crowds the board with 8 or fewer pieces. Divide the 5 times 5 board into 4 smaller 2 times 2 sub-boards in the corners, and label these sub-boards as (X, Y, Z,) and (T). - Each of these 2 times 2 sub-boards must share squares with at least 2 dominoes. Since a domino piece cannot straddle two 2 times 2 sub-boards, each sub-board needs at least two dominoes. 3. **Counting Pieces**: - This gives a total minimum of 4 times 2 = 8 dominoes for the sub-boards. - With the central 3 times 3 board left, if we allocated 8 pieces to the edge sub-boards, the central square and its adjacent 4 squares labeled (A, B, C,) and (D) cannot be completely covered. 4. **Covering Center Squares**: - Dominoes covering (A, B, C,) and (D) would belong to different pieces covering other parts of the central board. None of these can be entirely within the central 3 times 3 cruises without leaving additional squares uncovered. 5. **Allocations and Gaps**: - Let's allocate 4 dominoes to the central 3 times 3 sub-board, which is necessary to ensure minimal gaps. - The edge 2 times 2 boards collectively, along with the surrounding squares (part of boundary), would likely not be fully covered with merely the allocated remaining pieces without leaving more gaps. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_3fc4f3a6ef7302a792fcg-29.jpg?height=368&width=365&top_left_y=757&top_left_x=925) 6. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, 8 pieces are insufficient to completely fill and crowd the board without gaps.

For clarity, recall the properties of odd and even digit sums: - The sum of two odd digits results in an even digit or an increment to the next significant digit. - The sum of one odd and one even digit results in an odd digit. - The sum of two even digits results in an even digit. 6. When working with odd and even digits, note that it's impossible for the final sum ( a + b ) to have all odd digits if ( a ) and ( b ) are both odd. - That means one of the digits at least must be even in the final examined list of digits. 7. Therefore, ensuring ( a ) and ( b ) are both composed of odd digits requires an exact case for ( a + b ). Let's use an exact example to substantiate this: [ text{Let } a = 5555555555 text{ and } b = 5555555555 ] - ( a ) and ( b ) contribute the maximum 20 odd digits. [ a + b = 5555555555 + 5555555555 = 11111111110 ] - ( a+b ) contributes 10 more digits as 1’s (odd digits) and one trailing zero (even digit). 8. Visually counting digits: - We have the 20 odd digits from ( a ) and ( b ) combined plus 10 odd digits from ( a + b ). Sum these odd digits to get: [ 20 + 10 = 30 ] Thus, the maximum number of odd digits that can be written on the board is indeed: [ boxed{30} ]"},{"prompt":"the expansion of (x frac {1}{x^{2}})^{9}, the coefficient of frac {1}{x^{3}} is _____.","completion":"To solve this, since the general term formula of the expansion of (x- frac {1}{x^{2}})^{9} is T_{r+1} = C_{9}^{r} cdot x^{9-r} cdot (-1)^{r} cdot x^{-2r} = (-1)^{r} cdot C_{9}^{r} cdot x^{9-3r}, let 9-3r=-3, solving this gives r=4, hence the coefficient of frac {1}{x^{3}} is C_{9}^{4} = 126, therefore, the answer is boxed{126}.

The total number of rocks in the field is then 10 (slate) + P (pumice) + 4 (granite) = 14 + P. The probability of choosing two slate rocks without replacement is calculated by finding the probability of choosing one slate rock and then another slate rock from the remaining rocks. The probability of choosing the first slate rock is 10 / (14 + P), since there are 10 slate rocks out of the total number of rocks. After one slate rock has been chosen, there are now 9 slate rocks left and one less rock in total, so the probability of choosing a second slate rock is 9 / (13 + P). The probability of both events happening is the product of the two probabilities: (10 / (14 + P)) * (9 / (13 + P)) = 0.15 Now we can solve for P: 90 / ((14 + P) * (13 + P)) = 0.15 90 = 0.15 * (14 + P) * (13 + P) 600 = (14 + P) * (13 + P) Expanding the right side, we get a quadratic equation: 600 = 14 * 13 + 14P + 13P + P^2 600 = 182 + 27P + P^2 Rearranging the terms to set the equation to 0: P^2 + 27P + 182 - 600 = 0 P^2 + 27P - 418 = 0 Now we can solve for P using the quadratic formula, P = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = 27, and c = -418.

Since there are 20 hands in the class not including Peter's, we need to find out how many hands Peter has to include him in the count.

Substitute x in the expression: [ log_{16} (16^{frac{1}{3}} + 3). ] However, to simplify this expression, notice that for small values of b near zero, log_{16}(16^{frac{1}{3}} + b) approx log_{16}(16^{frac{1}{3}}) + frac{b}{16^{frac{1}{3}} ln 16} by the logarithmic approximation log_{a}(x + y) approx log_a(x) + frac{y}{x ln a} for small y. Here b = 3, so: [ log_{16} (16^{frac{1}{3}} + 3) approx frac{1}{3} + frac{3}{16^{frac{1}{3}} ln 16}. ] This is a rough estimate; however, since ln 16 = 4 ln 2, and 16^{frac{1}{3}} = 2^{frac{4}{3}} approx 2.51984, we get: [ log_{16} (16^{frac{1}{3}} + 3) approx frac{1}{3} + frac{3}{2.51984 times 4 ln 2} approx frac{1}{3} (since frac{3}{2.51984 times 4 ln 2} is small). ] Thus, boxed{frac{1}{3}} is a reasonable estimate for log_{16} x."},{"prompt":"Let ( k geqslant 2 ) be a fixed positive integer.

Identify the vertices of the polygon: Name the vertices A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n in a counterclockwise order. 2. Consider the diagonals and their intersections: Each point of intersection inside the polygon is determined by the intersection of two diagonals. Specifically, if we take four vertices A_i, A_j, A_k, and A_l such that i < j < k < l, the diagonals A_iA_k and A_jA_l will intersect at a unique point inside the polygon. 3. Calculate the number of such sets of four vertices: The number of ways to choose four vertices out of n vertices is given by the binomial coefficient binom{n}{4}.

Since the selection of a video and an image are independent events (the selection of one does not affect the selection of the other), we can say that the probability of both happening together, P(A), is the product of their individual probabilities, P(B) and P(C). This directly addresses option B, indicating that P(A) = P(B) cdot P(C) is correct. 2. **Analyzing the Incorrect Option A**: - Option A suggests that P(A) = P(B) + P(C), which is not how probabilities of independent events combine. This option is incorrect because it misrepresents the rule for combining probabilities of independent events. 3. **Exploring the Complement of Event A (overline{A})**: - The complement of event A, overline{A}, includes all scenarios where either video A is not selected, image B is not selected, or both are not selected. This can be broken down into three distinct cases: - Video A is not selected, but image B is selected (overline{B}C). - Video A is selected, but image B is not selected (Boverline{C}). - Neither video A nor image B is selected (overline{B}overline{C}). - Therefore, we have P(overline{A}) = P(overline{B}C) + P(Boverline{C}) + P(overline{B}overline{C}), which means P(overline{A}) > P(overline{B}C) + P(Boverline{C}). This confirms that option C is correct. 4. **Comparing P(Boverline{C}) and P(overline{B}C)**: - For P(Boverline{C}), the probability that video A is selected but image B is not selected is frac{a-1}{ab}, since there are a-1 other videos and b possible images. - For P(overline{B}C), the probability that video A is not selected but image B is selected is frac{b-1}{ab}, since there are b-1 other images and a possible videos. - Given that a > b > 1, it follows that frac{a-1}{ab} > frac{b-1}{ab}, which means P(Boverline{C}) > P(overline{B}C).

Solving this, we get: t = e, thus f(x) = ln x + e, f'(x) = frac{1}{x}, therefore, f(x) - f'(x) = ln x + e - frac{1}{x} = e, which means ln x - frac{1}{x} = 0, so the solution of the equation f(x) - f'(x) = e can be transformed into the solution of the equation ln x - frac{1}{x} = 0.

We can color five cells red and four cells blue such that no two red cells share a side. 3. **General Pattern:** - We observe that the cells can be colored in a checkerboard pattern to ensure no two red cells share a side. - For an equilateral triangle of side length ( n ), the total number of cells is ( n^2 ). 4. **Checkerboard Coloring:** - In a checkerboard pattern, each row alternates colors. - For a row of length ( 2m + 1 ), there are ( lceil frac{2m+1}{2} rceil ) red cells and ( lfloor frac{2m+1}{2} rfloor ) blue cells. 5. **Counting Red and Blue Cells:** - For an equilateral triangle of side length ( n ), the number of red cells is approximately half of the total cells. - The number of red cells is ( lfloor frac{n^2 - 1}{2} rfloor + k ), where ( n in {2k-1, 2k} ) and ( k ge 1 ). - The number of blue cells is ( lfloor frac{n^2 - 1}{2} rfloor + 1 - k ). 6. **Induction Proof:** - **Base Case:** For ( n = 1 ), there is 1 cell, and it can be red. - **Inductive Step:** Assume the formula holds for ( n = k ). For ( n = k+1 ), we add a new row of ( k+1 ) cells. By the checkerboard pattern, the new row will have ( lceil frac{k+1}{2} rceil ) red cells and ( lfloor frac{k+1}{2} rfloor ) blue cells. This maintains the balance and ensures no two red cells share a side. 7. **Conclusion:** - The least number of blue cells required is given by the formula ( lfloor frac{n^2 - 1}{2} rfloor + 1 - k ). The final answer is ( boxed{ lfloor frac{n^2 - 1}{2} rfloor + 1 - k } )."},{"prompt":"Given that the eccentricity of ellipse G: frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}} + frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} = 1 (a > b > 0) is frac{sqrt{6}}{3}, the right focus is at (2sqrt{2}, 0), and the line l with slope 1 intersects ellipse G at points A and B. An isosceles triangle is formed with AB as the base and P(3, 2) as the apex.

Solving for a, we get a = 2sqrt{3}. Since b^2 = a^2 - c^2, we have b^2 = 4. Therefore, the equation of ellipse G is frac{x^{2}}{12} + frac{y^{2}}{4} = 1. (2) Let the equation of line l be y = x + m. Solving the system of equations begin{cases} y = x + m frac{x^{2}}{12} + frac{y^{2}}{4} = 1 end{cases} gives us 4x^2 + 6mx + 3m^2 - 12 = 0. Let (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) (x_1 < x_2) be the coordinates of points A and B, respectively, and (x_0, y_0) be the midpoint of AB. Then, x_0 = frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = -frac{3m}{4} and y_0 = x_0 + m = frac{m}{4}. As AB is the base of isosceles triangle triangle PAB, PE perp AB. Thus, the slope of PE is k = frac{2 - frac{m}{4}}{-3 + frac{3m}{4}} = -1. Solving for m, we get m = 2. Substituting m = 2 into equation 4x^2 + 6mx + 3m^2 - 12 = 0 gives us 4x^2 + 12x = 0. Solving for x, we have x_1 = -3 and x_2 = 0. Consequently, y_1 = -1 and y_2 = 2. Therefore, |AB| = 3sqrt{2}. The distance d from point P(-3, 2) to line AB: y = x + 2 is d = frac{|-3 - 2 + 2|}{sqrt{2}} = frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}.
